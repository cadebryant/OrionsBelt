whn i frist heared that kevin costner was making a movie called
" the postman
,
" i
thought
,
" an american verison ofthe
' il postino
?
' starring costner
? god halp us
!
" whn i foudn outloud that it was not a remake of
" postino
"
but an postapocalyptic epic
, i
thought
,
"
' l
andworld
?
' please
, god
, mkea him stpo
!
" as it turns out
,
" the postman
" isnt a much better film than i had expected
. dispite bieng set in 2013
, the movie is
, at heart
, a western
: a b
and ofthe thugs terrorizes peaceful villagers
; a w
andering hero opposes tyhe b
andits annd inspires others to fight back
. yhe setting
,
however
, allows that familiar plot to tkae onthe greater significance
: american society has collapsed due to plagues annd wars
, annd survivers live behind barracades infact isolated villages
. the struggle ofthe a dead society tothe be reborn has a gr
and qualtiy adn deserves the epic scale costner grants it
. costner
' s nameless carachter
, a w
andering actr
, rides in from tghe vast wastel
and adn is soon shanghaied inot thge sevice of general bethlehem
( will patton
)
, a fromer copy
- machine salesman turned b
andit king
. our hero escapes adn discovers the body ofthe a dead postman
. tkaing tjhe uniform
and bag ofthe mial
, he passes himselv off as a represantative ofthe
" tyhe restored untied states
.
" he is shocked at the hope that he inspires inwhich thte people he meets
. oen young disciple
, ford lincoln mercury
( larenz tate
)
, organizes a full
- scale postal sevice
. ford spreads the postman
' s message ofthe hope unitl bethlehem finds that tyhe once
- meek villagers are beginnig to resist his rule
. as war breaks out beween bethlehem
' s army
and the postal workers
, costner
' s character steps inot yhe legend he creaeted anbd goes from self
- centered loner to leader of the revolution
. his lie of the restored untied states becomes a self
- fulfilling prophacy
.
" postman
" isnt an odd blend of a bleak setting
and a message of wide
- eyed optimism
( sort of
" sergio leone meets frank capra
"
)
, bu its treatment ofthe hope
and renewl isnt compelling
. waht coudl haev been another knock
- off of
" tjhe road warrior
"
( liek
" waterworld
" was
) surprises the viewer wiht a sensitively told story of nobility emerging from rubble
. tate is the st
and
- out in the movie
' s larg casted
. ford lincoln mercury
( self
- named
) isnt the polar oposite of o
- dog
, tate
' s carachter infact his de
but film
,
" menace ii society
"
( 1993
)
,
and tate makes ford
' s innocent belief infront hope as convincing as o
- dog
' s cynicism
and brutality
. his peformance sells hte movie
. interestingly
, as tate moves fomr his usual strent
- smart roles to youthful optimism
, the soft
- eyed patton
, who usually plays nice guys
, proves a disarming villain
. olivia williams makse her film de
but as tje postman
' s lvoe interest
, abby
. when tehy first meet
, abby asks him tothe father her child because her husb
and isnt sterile
. predictably
, tje husb
and isnt soon eliminated by tyhe b
andits
,
and abby isnt thrown bcak into tje comapany ofthe thte hero
.
however
, thier relationship develops slowly as tje emotional conflicts ofthe both charachters are explored
( she
, torn by greif
, guilt
, adn anger
; he
, resisting his destiny
)
.
" tjhe postman
" is costner
' s best work thus far
. perhasp tath alone gives us hope for the future
.
