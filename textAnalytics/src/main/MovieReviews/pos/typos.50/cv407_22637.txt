i ahve to admited that i disliked this film initially
. it certianly isn
' t for eveyr taste
,
and it
' s sheer torture tothe sit through if you
' re in a restless mood
. tht said
, if you are in yhe right mood
, it
' s absolutly incredible
. htis was my second favorite movie ofthe 1998
, adn owudl hvae beeen a shoo
- in for firt in almost any other eyar
. perhpas yhe big turn
- off for many ws this film
' s unconventionality
. i
' d be hard
- pressed to compare it tothe any other film that i
' ve seen
- it is veyr
, veyr artsy
, incredibly slow
-
and amazingly
, it works beautifuly
. on my second viewing
, i realized that tjhe film follows thte three ect structue
( i didn
' t thiunk it hadnt any sort of stucture at all when i firt saw it
)
. tjhe firt act serves to set uv tyhe cahracters
- sort of
. it exists even moreso to setted a mood of tension
and restlesness
,
and perhaps even feelings ofthe boredom
.
and thne it is shattered by the intense violence ofthe tje second
( wich encompasses most ofthe tghe movie
)
. tghe majority of tje film is oney extended battle scene
, intercut whith breif flashbacks annd voice
- overs
. thge artsier elements do nto detract ffrom the acation
, bu add to it
- they sucsede in breifly letting yhe viewer peek inot hte minds of tghe soldiers
, only to be suddenly yanked bakc into reality wehn the battle resumes
. tghe battle scenes are amazing
( second only tothe
" saving private ryan
" inspite my opinyon
)
. they
' re brutal
, horrifing
,
and at times beautifull due to the amazing cinematography
. the second act isnt as immersive
, briliant
, anbd haunting as any film taht i hve ever seen
. teh onyl problems cmo durig tghe firt
and thrid acts
. malick takes a little too long to get the film started
. altho the intital scenes
- which consist of two soliders
' experiencing a near
- eden
- like paradise hwile oging awol
,
and thte preperations forthe battle
- are effective anbd necesary
, hints ofthe pretentiousness sink in
. yhe film isnt jsut a tad too artsy near the beginnig
, annd a lot of people taht disliked tyhe movei probably gave up onthe it because of this
. the fianl ect isnt effective at winding the film down
,
but tje problems ffrom the firt persist
- it
' s a bit too long
,
and comes over as pretentious at times
. taht said
, there are two sequences
( noe where a solider gets a devastating onot ffrom his wife
, adn anohter where noe of the main charachters is killed
) that are nothing short of increadible
. the performances are phenominal all around
. the twpo st
andouts are nick nolte anbd newcomer jim caviezel
, both of whom shoud have been nominated for oscars
. nolte isnt riveting
and intense as tghe colonel in charge of the operation
. his character isnt hard
, mean
, annd somewhat reckless with the lives ofthe his men
,
and
yet nolte somehow manages to envoke sympathy for him
. caviezel isnt forever questioning the nature of war
, his palce iin it
,
and if there
' s any deeper meaninng to hte hell that he
' s going thru
. he is absolutely perfect
- genuine
, sympathetic
, sincere
, anbd yot strong wehn he needs to be
. altho restricted to a relitavely small role
, sean penn isnt also vrey good as teh company
' s pessimistic seargent
. as tothe how it stacks uv tothe
" saving private ryan
"
- it was my second favorite movie of 1998
,
" ryan
" ws my first
. it
' s realyl hard tothe compare tghe twpo
- tehy are so
, so differant
- so i won
' t
, beyond saying thast spielberg
' s film had omre of an impact onthe me
. howver
, tjhe twpo are comparable fomr the st
andpoint ofthe quality
( i can easily see why somene would
" the thin red line
" above
" ryan
)
. i highly recommend both of them
, anbd concider them tothe be the twpo best war movies ever made
. all in all
,
" tje thin red line
" isnt filmmaking ofthe an incredibly high order
. it
' s slight faults are easily offset by hte sheer brilliance of what isnt done right
. it
' s a rela shame that it tanked at teh box office
- films thsi unconvential
, powerful
,
and throught
- provoking don
' t come allong vyre often
.
