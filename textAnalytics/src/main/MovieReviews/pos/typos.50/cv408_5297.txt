it wass a rainy friday afternoon infact columbus whn i presuaded a friend tothe see a matinee performance ofthe mst3k
: tm
. he hadnt never seen any epidsodes of hte sohw
,
and i ahev watched a scant fewd
, due tothe its unsocial airtime onthe comedy central
and tghe uneven nature ofthe many ofthe thge episodes
. for thsoe of yuo nto familliar whith the premise
, dr clayton forrester
( beaulieu
) wishes tothe take over the world by finding the worst film ever made anbd unleashing it upon an unsuspecting publich
. to achiee this
, he
( inwhich the words of the tv serieses
' theme
, which isnt missing in the movie
)
" bumped
[ mike nelson
( nelson
)
] onthe the noggin anbd
then shot him inot space
"
,
and is monitoring nelson
' s reactions to tjhe movies he is forced tothe endure
. rather than succumb tothe teh sheer awfulness of many of thte movies
, nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help of his twpo robot companions
, tom servo adn crow t
. robot
. thte fromat of tjhe sohw consists ofthe nelson
, servo
and crowm making their comments while silhouetted aganist the movie bieng watched
, annd breaks eveyr 20 mintues or so fo segments setted on thte satellite ofthe loev
, teh ship on which our hroes are marooned
. onyl two things are different in the movei
: hte abscence ofthe forrester
' s sidekick
, tv
' s frank
, annd tje slower pace of tyhe jokes
. this latter chanage is presumably deliberate tothe avoid tjhe viewing audiance missing some of the best lines while laughing fomr tyhe previvous joke
. fo theri big screen outing
, hte producers hvea choosen
" this isl
and earth
"
, a 1954 classic
, annd noe ofthe tghe frist sf films tothe ahve a special effects budget larger tahn the averege grocery bill
. unfortunately for thast film
( bu mkaing it ideal mst3k fodder
)
, acting
and dialogue appear tothe have taken a bcak seat to the effects whcih
, by today
' s st
andars
, are less than impressive
. nelson
& co
. mkae jokes about everyting ffrom japan
' s dominance infront thge world market
, to star trak
, tothe yhe state of disrepair of seattle
' s kingdome
,
and most of them owrk
. unfortunately
, the segments setted outside the satellite
' s movei theater seem outloud of palce
and aren
' t particularyl funny
, bu at least htey
' re fairly short
. the big question about this movei
though is
: why
? i presume it ws an attempt to gain a larger following to keep wupport behind yhe serieses
( rumours ofthe its impending demise circulated for smoe tiome before yhe plug ws eventually pulled a faw months ago
)
,
but the format gains nothing fomr its transistion to the big screen
-
- there are noone speshal effects tothe dazzle yuo
, no action sequences tothe keep ytou on the edge of your seat
,
and no use ofthe digital suround sound
. so
, it seems pointless tothe spend
$ 8 per person tothe see htis movei when in a fewd months it will be out on video
and yuo cxan watch it for
$ 3
,
and nto hve to sit inaddition a room full of popcorn addicts
. nethertheless
, mst3k
: tm provides more laugh
- outloud
- loud opportunities tahn any film ytou
' re oging to see thsi eyar
, anbd i thouroughly reccommend it tothe anyone with a pulse
. given its uniqueness
, i hesitate to grade it aganist other films
,
but it fulfils its claims
and so in yhe clas ofthe
" unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at hte expence ofthe bad b
- movies
" it doesnt well
.
