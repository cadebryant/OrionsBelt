) tjhe film follows renton who gets clean
, gets back into heroin anbd gets clean agian
. some ofthe the witn inaddition this movei isnt sharp
and pulp fiction
- esque
, adn soem is just dumb
& dumber gross
( hte bed sheets
)
and stupid
( the bb gun
)
al
though thge film starts out onthe a comic note
, it takes a sharp term in the middle
, annd becomes almost depressing
. yhe film isnt based onthe an irving welsh novel bearing the smae title
. i cxan honestly say tath htis is one of the best movies i haev ever seen
. it is an obscure gem that has beeen over shadowed in the us by such movies as mission impossible
and id4
. tghe film is hard tothe folow wih tyhe heavy accents ofthe tjhe actors
. htis isnt a very original film
, as far as films go today
. it definetly deserves mutiple viewings
( partly becuase of thge slang anbd accents
