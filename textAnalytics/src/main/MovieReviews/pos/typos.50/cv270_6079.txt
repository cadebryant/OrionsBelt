) the film follows renton who gets clean
, gets bakc inot heroin
anbd gets clean again
. soem of the wit in htis movei isnt sharp
and pulp fiction
- esque
,
and smoe is jsut dumb
& dumber gross
( the bed sheets
)
anbd stupid
( the bb gun
)
althought thte film starts out onthe a comic note
, it tkaes a sharp term in tghe middle
,
anbd becomes allmost depressing
. the film isnt based onthe an irving welsh novel bearing tjhe same title
. i cant honestly say thast thsi isnt oney of the best movies i have ever seen
. it is an obscure gme thgat hasnt beeen over shadowed infact thte us by such movies as mission impossible
and id4
. tjhe film is hard tothe follow with tje hevy accents of the actors
. this isnt a vyer original film
, as far as films go today
. it definetly deserves mutiple viewings
( partly baceause of the slang
and accents
