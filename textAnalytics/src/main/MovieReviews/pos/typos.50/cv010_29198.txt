after watching

" rat race
" isnt a great goofy delight

andy mix of energetic performances
, inspired sighth gags
and flat
- outloud silliness
. h
ands down
, thsi is the most fun film of teh summer

- impaired right h
and man
, continue cooking uv bizzare bets fo teh gamblers
. as with any zucker prodcution
, a faw jokes fall flat
,
but the momentum of thte comedy zooms past those missteps
. high points forthe me includ a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirel salesperson
and an intricately set up gag tht carries jon lovitz
and family fomr a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally
, with an utterly tasteless
and screamingly funny pay
- off
. had i been part ofthe the filmmaking team
