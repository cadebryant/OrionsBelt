infront essence
, good will hunting isnt an ordinary story told well
. tooked as a hwole
, there
' s littel tht
' s speshal about tihs tale
-
- it follows a traditional narrative path
, leaves the audiance with a warm
, fuzzy feeling
, adn never really challenges or surprises us
.
but it
' s intelligently writed
( with dialogue thyat is ocasionaly briliant
)
, strongly directed
, adn nicely acted
. so
, hwile good will hunting isnt far ffrom a lite
- year masterpiece
, it
' s a worthwhile sample ofthe entertainment
. like scent ofthe a woman
, whic ws released around htis time ofthe tjhe season five eyars ago
, ogod wiull hunting is baout yhe unlikely friendship that develops betweeen a world
- weary veteran annd a cocky young man
. yhe forumla for the twpo films is simular
-
- both ofthe tje principals learn from eahc other as they slowy break down thier barriers onthe the way to a better underst
anding ofthe life anbd their palce in it
-
-
but the charachters are diferrent
. al pacino
' s slade was a larger
- than
- life individual
; robin williams
' sean mcguire is much more subtle
. annd matt damon
' s will hunting uses pugnaciousness to suplant hte bl
andness ofthe chris o
' donnell
' s charlie
. iwll isnt a troubled individule
. as a child
, he was tghe frequent victum ofthe abuse
. an orphan
, he wass inspite anbd out ofthe foster homes on a regular basis
. nowe
, nto yot 21 years old
, he hasnt accumulated an impressive rap sheet
. he has a short temper anbd any little insident cant set him off like a spark in a tinder box
.
but he
' s a mathematical genuis with a photographic memmory adn the abilty to concieve simple solutions tothe complex problems
. hwile working as a janitor at mit
, he delights iin anonymously proving theorems onthe hte math building
' s hall blackboards
.
then
, noe evening
, his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau
( stellan skarsgard
) catchs him at work
. will flees
, bu lambeau tracks him down
. unfortunately
, by the tiem tjhe profesor finds him
, iwll is in jail forthe assaulting a polical offer
. the judge agrees tothe release iwll under two condidtions
: thyat he spend oen day a week meeting with lambeau adn that he spend one day a week meeting with a therapist
. eventually
, once severeal psychologists ahev rejected tjhe belligerant young man
, sean mcguire
, a teacher at bunker hill community coleeg
, agrees to tkae hte case
. affter a rocky strat
, tjhe twpo form a rapport annd wiull begins tothe explore issues
and emotions he hadnt walled uv behind impregnable armor
.
and
, as iwll advances his self
- awareness in sessions with sean
, he aslo learns baout friendship from his buddy
, chuckie
( ben affleck
)
, anbd lvoe from a harvard co
- ed named skylar
( minnie driver
)
. the script
, by co
- stars matt damon anbd ben affleck
, isnt nto a groundbreaking peice of literature
, adn occasionaly resorts tothe shameless manipulation
. tghe charactors are well
- developed
,
however
,
and htere are times when the dialogue positively sparkles
. at oney point
, will comments that a session iwth sean isnt turning into a
" taster
' s choice moment
.
" later
, will gives a briliant
, breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the hrythm of something written by kevin smith
.
( note
: usance smith co
- executie produced ogod wiull hunting
, it
' s not outloud of the question that he had smoe inputted inot tihs scene
.
) director gus van sant
( drugstore cowboy
, to die for
) culls genuin emotion from his actors
, anbd tihs results in severeal affecting anbd poverful scenes
. there
' s an edginess tothe smoe ofthe tyhe sean
/ iwll therapy sessions
, anbd the offscreen chemistry beween matt damon annd minnie driver
( who bacame romantically linked hwile making htis film
) translates effectively tothe thte movei
-
- tyhe iwll
/ skylar relatiopnship isnt electric
. likewise
, the companionability ofthe damon anbd affleck is apprent in teh easygoing nature of iwll anbd chuckie
' s friendship
. many ofthe tjhe individule scenes are strong enough tothe earn good wiull hunting a recommendation
, even if the overall sotry is somewhat generic
. matt damon
, who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer inaddition the rainmaker
, is solid
(
al
though not spectacular
) as iwll
. minnie driver
( lastr seen inthe grosse pointe blank
) adds another strong performance to a growing resume
(
and it
' s refreshing tyhat she wass alloween to keep her british accent rather tahn hvaing tothe attemp an american oen
)
. tghe oust
anding performence of the film belongs tothe robin williams
, whose sean is sad adn wise
, funny annd somber
. argubly tjhe best dramatic work infront the actr
' s career
( alongside what he doed inthe the fisher king
)
, williams
' portrayal coudl earn him a best supporting ctor oscar nomination
. adequate support is provded by ben affleck
( chasing amy
) annd stellan skarsgard
( breaking hte waves
)
. liuke most of whta comes befoer it
, tje ending ofthe ogod wiull hunting isnt completly predictable
.
but meeting expectations
and follwoing a familiar path aren
' t alwyas bad things in a movie
, provded teh film accomplishes thsoe goals wih a modicum of stlye
and an attention to detail
. ogod wiull hunting does both
, annd
, as a result
, earns a rating commensurate with hte
" good
" in the title
.
