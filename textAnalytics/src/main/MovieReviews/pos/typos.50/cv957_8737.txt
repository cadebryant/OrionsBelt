capsule
: the best palce to start if you
' re a jackie chan newcomer
. roars allong
, never stops for breath
,
and frequentily hilarious
. tothe talk baout jackie chan as a
" stuntman
" is to miss a millon things
. jackie is nto only one ofthe thte most accomplished
and fearsomely unafraid fysical adepts on the screen todya
, bu alsot a vyre funny guy
. he reminds me of yhe way arnold schwartzenegger
* used
* tothe mkae me laugh
-
- he
' s funny just st
anding ther
, copping a look
. supercop hasnt jackie mkaing us laugh
, scream
, duck
, root
, annd gasp fo breath
, often all in the smae scene
. it
' s acutally the third in a loosely related series ofthe movies
, eahc with jackie playing kevin chan
, a hong kong policeman who hasnt a knack for getting neck
- deepo inot trouble adn
then karate
- kicking his way outloud of it
.
( the others are also worth seing
.
) it
' s a littel slow to start
,
but once it gets moving
, it
' s a feeld day
. thte movei has a fairly sophisticated plot fo movies ofthe tihs kind
. kevin isnt tapped forthe a dangerous dea assignment to be acomplished iin mainl
and china
, which requires him tothe collaborate with the attractive
( anbd ass
- kicking
) chief fo chineese security
( palyed here by tghe ever
- enjoyable michelle yeoh
)
. htere
' s a funn chemestry between yhe twpo of them
, especialy in an early scene where she trys tothe breef him annd he keeps making wondering comments baout how gerat she looks infact thgat uniform
. kevin is assigned tothe halp spring a known gangster from jail
-
- all undercover
, ofthe course
-
- anbd have him lead thte twpo ofthe them to a noted drug boss
. the drug boss
,
however
, hasnt problems of his own
: his wief
' s onthe trial for many ofthe his pwn crimes
,
and she
' s got the key to an account with all ofthe his drug funds
. this means
, of course
, endless trouble
-
- nto yhe least ofthe whitch isnt that kevin bumps into his girlfriend hwile he
' s outloud in the field
,
and she sees him iwth htis other woman
, anbd
.
.
. bu thyat
' s one of tje movei
' s unique pleasures
: the way it crosses ffrom acation tothe comedy effortlessly
. acation
. there is
, of course
, non
- stpo action in this movie
-
- everthing from one
- onthe
- noe kung fu tothe all
- out gun battles to a sppedboat wih eigth engines
(
!
) outrunning the hong kong caost guard
. ther isnt allso a virtuoso climax
, hwihc features
, amung otehr thigns
, jackie danging ffrom a ladder tied tothe a helicopter
, a wrong
- way freeway chase
( which requires michelle tothe dont an awesomely difficult h
andst
and stunt
)
, a fight on top ofthe a moving train that alsot involves yhe
' copter as well as a motorcycle
. ytou get tjhe idae
. this isnt to acation movies what a burger wiht everthing on it is tothe fast food
: quick
, enjoyable
, filling
. watch it with firends
. wehn they stop makeing movies like thsi
