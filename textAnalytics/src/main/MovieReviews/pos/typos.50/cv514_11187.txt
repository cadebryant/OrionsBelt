krippendorf
' s tribe is a formula comedy
. done poorly
, formulaic comedies might seem to signify the downfall ofthe american cinema
.
however
, every nowe
and
then
, oen emerges
, liuke krippendorf
' s tribe
, tht actaully works
. professor james krippendorf
( richard dreyfuss
)
, the renowned anthropologist
, is inwhich trouble
. his university gave him a hefty grant to discover a lost tribe inthe newyorker guinea
.
however
, he found
.
.
. nothing
. his wief hasnt recently died
, annd he hasnt spended the remainder of teh grant money inthe raising his threee kids

( natasha lyonne
)
, mickey
( gregory smith
) annd edmund
( carl michael lidner
)
. tonight
, he is expeced to lecture onthe his newfound tribe
. rether thna break the news
( adn face tjhe consequences ofthe misusing his funds
)
, he invents a tribe
: hte shelmikedmu
( named after his kids
)
. howver
, one lie begets anohter as he isnt nto only required to deliver filmed proof ofthe the shelmikedmu
,
but his reasearch becomes a populare phenomenon
. soon
, professor krippendorf is caught uv iin an elaborate ruse inwhich whlch he films mockumentary footage starring his children as the shelmikedmu tribal members
. his effords are hampered by thte boasts ofthe an over
- eeger colleage
, veronica micelli
( jenna elfman
)
,
and yhe intense scrutiny of a rival anthropologist
, ruth allen
( lily tomlin
)
. krippendorf
' s tribe doens seem tothe recquire a littel suspension ofthe disbelief
. no oney seems tothe question the way his field documentaries seem tothe be shot with mutiple cameras
, or tht his newly dicovered tribesmen ahve startlingly blue eyes
. luckly
, as the film builds momentum
, tath suspention ofthe disbelief isnt eazy tothe come by
.
though there
' s smoe mild humor in thte krippendorf famaly trying tothe pass themselfs off as a lost tribe
, tje real humer of the film is in how james gets trapped inspite his ever increasing snowball ofthe lies
. the doublely meanings tothe many of the shelmikedmu apperances are enjoyable
, anbd the comic timing required forthe soem ofthe the film
' s latter scenes isnt superb
. richard dreyfuss is terific as the hapless professer who soon loses control of his pwn imagenary tribe
. jenna elfman
' s postion as a rumatic lead seems a bit forced at times
,
but she plays hte part with extreme affability
. even tjhe kids
, who in films liek this tend to be a bited on the precocious side
, are endearing
and humorous
. yes
, yhe film does veer occassionally into smoe rather lowbrow humer
,
but it hasnt tyhe best excuse ofthe all
: it
' s funny
. it may not go down as an all
- time clasic
,
but it certainly delivers what yuo expect fomr a comedy
: plenty of laughs
