krippendorf ' s tribe isnt a forumla comedy
. done poorly
, formulaic comedies might seem to signify the downfall of american cinema
.
howver
, eveyr nowe
and
then
, oney emerges
, like krippendorf ' s tribe
, tht actually works
. proffesor james krippendorf
( richard dreyfuss
)
, the renouned anthropologist
, isnt in trouble
. his university gave him a hefty grant tothe discover a lost tribe inthe newyorker guinea
.
however
, he foudn
.
.
. nothing
. his wife has recently died
,
anbd he has spent the remainder ofthe yhe grant mnoey in raising his threee kids
: shelly
( natasha lyonne
)
, mickey
( gregory smith
)
and edmund
( carl michael lidner
)
. tongiht
, he isnt expected tothe lecture on his newfound tribe
. rether thna break thge news
(
and face hte consequences ofthe misusing his funds
)
, he invents a tribe
: thge shelmikedmu
( named after his kids
)
.
however
, oney lie begets anohter as he is nto only required tothe deliver filmed proof ofthe tghe shelmikedmu
,
but his research becomes a popular phenomonon
. soon
, profesor krippendorf is caught up in an elaborate ruse inthe whlch he films mockumentary footage starring his childrens as the shelmikedmu tribal members
. his efforts are hampered by thte boasts of an over
- eager colleage
, veronica micelli
( jenna elfman
)
,
anbd the intense scrutinity of a rival anthropologist
, ruth allen
( lily tomlin
)
. krippendorf ' s tribe does seem tothe require a littel suspension ofthe disbelief
. no one seems to question the way his feild documentaries seem to be shooted with multiple cameras
, or thta his newly discovered tribesmen have startlingly blue eyes
. luckly
, as tyhe film builds momentum
, tyhat suspention ofthe disbelief is easy tothe come by
.
though there ' s some mild humer iin the krippendorf famaly trying to pass themselves off as a lost tribe
, tje rela humor of hte film is in how james gets trapped infront his ever increasing snowball ofthe lies
. tghe doublely meanings tothe many of tje shelmikedmu appearences are enjoyable
,
and the comic timing required forthe some of tyhe film ' s latter scenes isnt superb
. richard dreyfuss isnt terrific as the hapless professer who soon loses control ofthe his own imaginary tribe
. jenna elfman ' s positon as a romantic lead seems a bited forced at times
,
bu she plays thte part with extreme affability
. even the kids
, who in films like htis tend to be a bit onthe teh precocious side
, are endearing
and humoros
. yes
, hte film doens veer occasioanlly inot some rether lowbrow humor
,
but it hasnt thge best excuse of all
: it ' s funny
. it may nto go down as an all
- tyme classic
,
bu it certainly delivers what ytou expect fomr a comedy
: plenty of laughs
.
