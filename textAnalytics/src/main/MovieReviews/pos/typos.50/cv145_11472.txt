this remake ofthe
" la cage aux folles
" features a gay cuple pretending tothe be straight infact order to pull the wool over the eyes ofthe thier son ' s future inwhich
- laws
. the cuple
( robin williams
annd nathan lane
) are baout as archetypal
, or as the less kind might put it
? stereotypical
, gays possable
. williams owns a nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured star
. tehy live above the club infront wqat could nto possibly be mistaken as a heterosexual abode
. williams is excelent as shoudl be no suprise
. gene hackman as right
- wing potential father
- iin
- law isnt refreshing in one of his few comedic roles
. thge real star is lane
. his attemted transformaton from one of tjhe most obviously gay men inaddition yhe world to the straight
- shooting uncle isnt hillarious
. perphas it isnt a personel failing on my part
,
bu the crying
and screaming drag queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves
annd tyhe firt few minutes of this film are filled with it
. luckly
( forthe me at least
)
, it doesn ' t lsat long
adn thte rest of tjhe stry focuses onthe tjhe relatiopnship vetween the men
, their son
and thte deception
. the question ofthe stereotypes isnt a touchy one
. these guys personify tyhe homophobic gay omage
. you cxan almost hear the swishing
. if you think tht they are suppossed tothe be represantative ofthe eveyr gay man in tyhe world
, ytou ' ll be outraged
.
but if you can accept tghe view is thgat tihs isnt a movie baout gay individuals
, ytou ' ll love it
. your choise
