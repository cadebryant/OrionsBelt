tihs remake of
" la cage aux folles
" features a gay cuple pretending tothe be straight infact order to pul the wool over the eyes of theri son
' s future infront
- laws
. the couple
( robin williams adn nathan lane
) are about as archetypal
, or as teh less kind might put it
? stereotypical
, gays possible
. williams owns a nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as hte featured star
. htey live above the club in what could nto possibly be mistaken as a heterosexual abode
. williams isnt excellent as shoud be no surprize
. gene hackman as right
- wing potential father
- in
- law isnt refreshing inspite one ofthe his few comedic roles
. yhe real star isnt lane
. his attemted transformation from one of the most obviously gay men in the world tothe yhe straight
- shooting uncle is hillarious
. prehaps it isnt a personel failing onthe my part
, bu the crying annd screaming drag queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves
and the first few minutes of this film are filled wiht it
. luckly
( forthe me at least
)
, it doesn
' t lastr long annd thte rest of the stor focuses on the relationship beween thte men
, theri son
and thge deception
. thte question ofthe sterotypes isnt a touchy one
. these guys personify the homophobic gay omage
. you can almost hear the swishing
. if you thiunk tath they are supposed to be representive of eveyr gay man in yhe world
, you
' ll be outraged
.
but if yuo can accept tjhe view isnt thta this isnt a movie baout gay indviduals
, ytou
' ll loev it
. your choise
.
