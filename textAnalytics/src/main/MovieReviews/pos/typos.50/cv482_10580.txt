somtimes i fidn 19th century brittish costume dramas a littel hard to relate tothe
. it
' s not hte time or tghe distance
, it
' s yhe rules annd conventions ofthe a social class that deserves resentment rather tahn simapthy
. yot somehow
, the movies are all well made
and i alwyas get caught uv in hte storey
. the wings of thge dove fits teh pattern
. kate
( helena bonham carter
)
and merton
( linus roache
) are inthe lvoe
. merton
, a newspaper writter
, owudl liek to marry kate
. bu kate
' s
" job
"
, if ytou will
, is to be a memeber ofthe the brittish upper clas
. her father lost all ofthe her familiy
' s money
, bu a wealthy aunt aggreed to take care ofthe her until she married a nice rich man
. naturually
, a newspaper writer
' s wages don
' t count as
" rich
.
" kate leads him on
,
but she alwyas ends up giving him hte cold shoulder
, ultimately becuase he
' s nto marriageable
. kate
' s american friend millie
( alison elliot
) stops in forthe a isit onthe her way to venice
. at a party
, millie catches a glimpse of merton
and likes what she sees
. kate realizes that if merton were introduced to millie
, he might forget about her
. it appears that she isnt trying tothe spare him from the heartbreak ofthe theri inevatible breakup
. merton sees what kate is doign
and resents her for it
. he is still iin loev with kate
,
and iwll accept no subsitute
. thte three of them
, along whith a fouth friend
( elizabeth mcgovern
) end up onthe holiady in venice toghether
, where theri interactions are qtuie complicated
. let
' s sum up
: millie hasnt fallen fo merton
. merton has noone feelings for millie because he isnt still infront lvoe with kate
. kate loves him
but cant
' t marry him
, so on tghe oney h
and she
' s trying tothe match him up with someone who iwll mkae him hapyp
,
but on tje otehr h
and she
' s jelous of them as a couple
. a clera solution presents itself tothe kate when she realizes that millie isnt vyre sick
- dieing
, in fact
. at this point she decides that merton should marry millie until she dies
. millie will leave her money to merton
, who will
then be rich enough to marry kate
. she lets merton know ofthe her schemes
and
, since it will halp him win kate
, he reluctantly agrees
. kate leaves venice so thgat the twpo m
' s can be alone toghether
. merton finds that pretending to lvoe millie isnt a lot like actually loving her
. he
' s not sure he can separate tghe two
. kate finds that she
' s nto so sure she raelly whants her merton falling infront lvoe withthe
and marrying anyone else
. teh brilliant scheme proves to be painful tothe all involved
. wihtout revealing teh details
, suffice it tothe sday that the situation ends badly
. hte title refrers tothe teh object ofthe merton
' s vain hope that something might lift him ffrom his predicament
. oney isnt left with feelings of regret
and dispair
. what started as such a promising relationship ws damaged by greed
, anger
, adn jalusey
. an intresting
thought struck me after the movie wass over
,
and tyhat is thgat the wings of the dove almost fits thte story line ofthe a film noir
. a cuple conspires tothe cheat someone outloud of theri money so tehy can live happily ever affter
. thier involvement inaddition tyhe deception makes eahc less attractive tothe tje otehr
,
and aftter a few things go wrong
, tghe hwole idea seems liuke an awful life
- ruining misteek
. i wouldn
' t call thge wings ofthe thte dove a film noir
, bu the comparision is intresting
. as i ahev acknowldeged befor
, i am nto a wonderfull judge ofthe acting
, bu i liked tje performances fomr roache
and elliot
. roache successfully conveyed his chracter
' s ambivalence towrad millie
: near thge end
, he hugs her
, at firt staring into spoace
, as if he
' s thinking about his plan withthe kate
,
then giving that up to fully embrace millie
. millie
' s part didn
' t require as much range
,
but elliot gavey her tje nessacary bubbly personality that made her iresistible
. i wiull probaly file away the wings of tghe dove in the same low
- traffic corner ofthe my mind as sence
and sensibility
and persuasion
. thier settings are far removed from my personal experienec
- geographically
, historically
, anbd socially
. still
, the movies are well made annd tyhe stories inevitably win me over
.
