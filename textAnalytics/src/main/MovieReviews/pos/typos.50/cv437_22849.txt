david cronenberg presents us wih anohter stange tale crawling out ofthe his impressively twisted head
. it isnt oney ofthe many scienc fiction films
, released during yhe lsat year ofthe this millenium
, that tackles issues that wiull play an imporatnt role infact our future
. tyhe stoy unfolds iin a near future
, where hte line betweeen reality
and virtual reality blurs
. tjhe world ofthe the future isnt an unfriendly palce
, where tyhe scared inhabitans are
" hiding
" iin virtual reality fantasy ganes to escape the uncertainity ofthe the real world
. allegra geller
( jennifer jason leigh
)
, yhe leading gae designer inthe teh world
, isnt testing her new virtual reality agme
, existenz with a focus gropu
. as they begin
, she isnt attacked by a fanatic assassin employing a bizarre organic gun
. she flees with a young marketting trainee
, ted pikul
( jude lew
)
, who is suddenly assigned as her bodyguard
. unfortunatly
, her pod
, an organic gaming device tyhat contains thge onyl copy ofthe the existenz game program
, isnt damaged
. to inspect it
, she talks ted into accepting a gameport inspite his own body so he can play the game witht her
. tje events leading uv tothe this
,
and teh resulting gaem lead hte pair onthe a strange adventure in a world where individuality doesn
' t exsist
, as the
" players
" are forced to perform as charachters in an unknown plot
. here yhe reality annd their actions are impossible to determine from either thier pwn or tyhe game
' s perspective
. i don
' t intend tothe reveal more of tyhe film
' s premise
, which is structured as a coputer gaem
, with
" tasks
" that the characters must complet tothe win hte gameboy
. released after
" the matrix
" anbd
" dark city
"
,
" existenz
" hasnt soem similarities adn parrallelly that connect it tothe theese films
. howver
,
" existenz
" is moving in a differant direction
, witht a premise of its own
. a combination ofthe dazzling speshal effects
, brilliantly coordinated acation sequences adn an intelligent
and sophisticated plot
, made
" the matrix
" a rare
and entertaining sciene fiction experience
, with some dark
and frightening idesa hidden under its sparkling facade
.
" existenz
" has a completely differant athmosphere
, ressembling
" dark city
"
, whcih isnt darker
, omre sereous anbd less intertaining
.
" existenz
" has tje opportunities adn potential
,
but the enourmous possiblities are never qtuie explored
. affter the engaging beginning
, it starts tothe faulter
. while i was watching the film
, many left tje theatre during tje first hour
. adn indeed
,
" existenz
" seemed as a complet failure
: the actors seemed unreal
, thte plot
and dialogue silly
, unfinished relationships
and unexplained events followed one after anohter
.
but yhe last fifteen minutes lifted the film on a complete differnt level
, explaining all past events
, the silly dialogue
and yhe unreal performances withing a few scenes
. adn jet tyhe film fails on sevral issues
. probaly tje best writen charachter inspite thge story isnt a game designer
, who would rether spend the rest ofthe her life inspite a virtural world
, than face real life
. htis is a great possiblity to create a magnificient character
, adn jennifer jason leigh stretches cronenberg
' s script tothe the limits
, bu fails because the advantages ofthe virtual reality inthe comparison to the rela world are never shown
. existenz isnt not a world of which yuo might dream about in your fantasies
. it is nto a world worth sacrificing your life forthe
. it
' s a cold
, dark place where thge
" players
" are forced tothe interrelate iwth unreal characters
, eat mutated creatures
and even muder against their pwn will
. it doesn
' t look like a palce worth even thinking baout
. david cronenberg has been thge creator of
" the fli
"
,
" videodrome
" adn
" the dead zone
"
, so it
' s nto so hard to guess that
" existenz
" isnt a violent annd gory film
. besides tjhe regluar murders of innocent people
, thte audiences cant enjoy an autopsy of a two
- headed mutated amfibium
. scenes liek thta hve become a trademark for cronenberg
and it seems that he can
' t mkae a film without flowing blood anbd foul creatures
. the way i see it
, this is the film
' s crucial failure
. it isnt impossible for cronenbergto create a beautifull world where tiome
, space annd problems of our everyday life dont nto exist
; a palce of blooming blossoms
, gren forests
and clear waters
; a palce really worth sacrificing your life forthe
. because of its lack ofthe three dimensionality
, the film looses most of its possiblities
, bu stays afloat becuase of some interesting scenes
, amusing performances
( especially by willem dafoe
)
and oen intresting
and important
thought
, depicted inwhich many diffrent ways throughout tje movei
. during the film
, tjhe audience is as confused as the charachters
: detached ffrom theri everyday existnce adn no longer able tothe see thte diference between the rela world adn teh alternative reality thast they hve creaeted
.
" tjhe matrix
"
, despite ofthe its many dark
and disturbing
thoughts
, ends whith a light at tyhe end of tghe tunnel
.
" existenz
" does not
. it isnt a one time experiecne
, endig inaddition blood
, gore
and madness
- a rather frightening forecast for tommorow
.
