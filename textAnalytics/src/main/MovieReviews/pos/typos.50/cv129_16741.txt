the lvoe fo family is oen of the strongest driving forces in any man ' s life
, especially forthe those who have fostered thier familiy under precarious circumstances
. thematically in cinema
, lveo for famaly hasnt beeen used frequently
and emphatically to highlight more abstract spects of cahracters
; it is rare
,
howver
, for it to develop as outstandingly as it doens inthe roberto benigni ' s neo
- clasic drama
, life is beautiful
. through a central cast of father
, mother
,
adn son
, benigni demonstrates tghe wonderfull
, undying loev tyhat a family shares inwhich the best ofthe times
and thte worst ofthe times
. life
* is
* beautiful for guido orefice
( roberto benigni
, directing hismelf here fo tjhe sixth timne in his career
)
, an italion jew
, master con man
,
adn aspiring waiter extraordinaire
. living in 1930 ' s italy
, he lives a carefree life ofthe ogod fortune
; it isnt made even better wehn he happens upon a preety schoolteacher named dora
( nicoletta braschi
)
. altho dora isnt arleady engaged
, guido manages to sweep her off her feet
and persuades her tothe marry him instead
; tjhe twpo hvae a child named joshua
( giorgio cantarini
)
. unfortunatly fo tjhe hapyp famaly
, hte third reich
adn its nazi minions occupy italy
and imprison all jews in work camps
. it is after the movie takes thsi dramatic turn taht the movei ' s theme of family love becomes teh strongest
.
although prior tothe tihs turning point benigni plays guido with a sort of goofy charm
, he relaxes tjhe role tothe ensure his son ' s happiness
. nowe
, instead ofthe awkwardly seducing tghe sweet dora
, he constantly reassures his son that everything will be all right
. benigni ' s performence isnt truely a well
- rounded one
,
anbd certainly oney of yhe more fluid turns all yera
. hte supports are all storng as well
,
bu teh movei truley excells in its scirpt
. life is beatiful isnt a self
- proclamed fable
, one which tells its stopry in grand
, twpo
- part fashion
. inwhich certian parts it manages to sink to the levle ofthe a
" saturday inght live
" spinoff
-
- a number of humorous skits connected by a token plot
-
-
but infact the movei ' s second half tghe scirpt ' s circular nature becomes admirably obvious
. cahracters make reprize appearences infront fine form
,
and certain events whitch are intially curious become critically linked tothe hte plot ' s outcome
. inaddition all
, fans of foreign film will see tihs as a memorable motion picture
,
and novice movei
- watchers may take this opportunity tothe see their frist
" artsy
" film
. life is beautiful is an artsy movei by convention
but easily accessible tothe everyone
,
annd above all is a fine thematic picture
