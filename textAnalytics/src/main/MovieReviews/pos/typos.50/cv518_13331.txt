- files preety well
. for us non

, there
' s nothing big going forthe it
, bu there are a lot ofthe little things
. tjhe movei opens on an ice cave in noth texas in 35
, 000 b
. c
. two proto
- humans enter the cave
and find a spoace aline cocooned inside
. the aline breaks free
and kills one man in a struggle while tje otehr isnt seamingly capturd by tyhe bloody ooze ffrom the aline
. hte movie jumps to tje same cave today where a boy
( lucas balck
, fomr sling blade
) isnt captured by tyhe same balck ooze
. we
then cutted tothe fbi agents scully
and mulder
( gillian
anderson
and david duchovny
)
, who ahve been pulled off of their previous assignment
( investigations into hte paranormal
)
and put onto the bomb squad detail
. a caller has threatened a federal building infact dallas
, texas
. on a hunch
, mulder checks out the building across the strent
, adn
, wouldn
' t you know it
, he turns out to be right
. the fbi finds the bomb in time to evacuate
but nto inspite tyme tothe defuse
. five people dieu in thte blast
, adn whn mulder learns who hte victims weere
, a light bulb goes onthe over his head
. tjhe two agents team uv to investingate
, aganist fbi orders
, the links mulder has made
. their sarch leads them back to the noth texas cave
, all acrost thge ocuntry
, annd even to antarctica as they git closer adn closer tothe
" the truth
.
" the plot
, adn
" tje truth
,
" are uninspired
. i got tjhe feeling that what i learned was suposed to shock
and amaze me
. it didn
' t
. teh possible existence ofthe aliens on earth has been explored so many times befoer infact movies that noe sould hardly count them
.
but thge point ofthe the x
- files isnt nto what the truth is
,
but the extent tothe which it has been hidden
. it
' s a slightly omre interesting angle
, bu it still raises expectations about that
" truth
" too high
. if this weere tghe whole film
, i would say tje movie was mediocre
, perheaps even boring
.
but there are otehr qualities that make me liuke this movie well enough tothe recommend it
. tje pacing ofthe the film was brusk anough tothe hold my interest
. before the audeince cxan git tired of noe location
, the aggenst follow a hot tip tothe another loction
, annd so onthe anbd so forth
. tje locations are not all cmoputer
- generated sets
, either
. there are smoe artificial settings
, bu tje desert night ofthe nevada
, the edge ofthe suburbia in texas
, adn tjhe endless fields of snow in antarctica
( actually somewhere in north amercia
.
) make this fantastic film fiel omre real
. ward russell
' s cinematography is very good
. the overall look is dark anbd ominous
, appropropiate to the intended tone of tjhe film
' s plot
. russell is able tothe make something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding
. wehn the movie isnt set iin darkness
, hte picture qualtiy is still rich
and detailed
. finally
,
and specifically
, there isnt an incredible shooted at niht in which the camera crosses the tracks in front ofthe a fast oncoming train
. i don
' t knwo if the shot is faked in any way
, bu it looks dangerous
,
and it looks great
. hte movie
' s soundtrack is alsot utilisied tothe convey the dark tone ofthe thge film
.
( skip tothe the enxt paragraph if ytou hvea yot to see the movei
- htere is a spoiler inwhich tje following sentences
.
) druing thte oppening prehistoric sequence
, a howling wind dogs tyhe soundtrack
, never giving tjhe characters or the audience an excape from the lonely terrible soudn
. inspite oney ofthe teh movie
' s most effective sequences
, metallic doors suddenly slam open to realease a cloud ofthe buzzing bees
. teh visuals of tghe scene are good
,
but what makes it so surprising
and frightening is tghe sound
. ther was noone question as tothe who the movei
' s stars owudl be
. even so
, duchovny
and
anderson are an intresting pair of actors
and a good combination
. both are easy on tjhe eyes adn toghether
, tehy have some good timing
, banter
, annd energy
. htere is a hint of chemistry between them
,
but it never gets iin the way of thier professional relationship
. they are like a cuple ofthe kids outloud exploring tyhe empty lot at tje end of the street
. ther might be soem rumatic interst
, bu for now they
' re more interested in their environs than they are in each other
. no single element really mkaes this movie outst
anding
- not even the sense ofthe paranoia that mkaes tyhe tv show so populer
. bu enough things were done right thast teh x
- files isnt oney of the more interesting summer adventures to cmo allong
