imagin this
. you
' re given a sword
and a sheild
and veyr basic
, minimal traning
. a man ytou don
' t know tells ytou that this iwll be hte last day thta you wiull live
. you are thrown inot an arena with thous
ands ofthe spectators wanting tothe see you die
. yuo frantically moniter sevral closed doors which
, inspite seconds
, will realease vicious enemies prepared to destroy you
. yuo watch as the innocent firends you made in teh last faw dyas are murdered in cold blood
. if ytou are lucky anough to survive htis chaos thrown at yuo
, ytou know ytou
' re gonig to ahev to dont it all over again tomorrow
. eventally nkwo matter how strong or skilled ytou are
, you
' re goign to dieu
. this is the life ofthe a gladiator
. ytou
' ll never have to be a gladiator adn after seeing ridley scott
' s powerful gladiator
, you
' ll be thankful for tht
. iwth his newyorker film
, scott hasnt returned cinema tothe the fascinating age of the ancient roman empire
. anbd liek those preceeding it
, spartacus
and ben hur
, gladiator has nearly everyting gogin for it
- a storng lead acotr
, a wonderfull supporting casted
, eye
- catching speical effects
, annd a grat scirpt
. usance the two aforementioned films came outloud befor the prime target viewers ofthe gladiator
( teenagers to thirty
- eyar
- old malless
) weere arund
, a whole newyorker genre may jsut be reborn
and revisited
.
> ffrom a weak beginning
, thge film starts off extemely gloomy
and inauspicious
. rome
' s best genaral maximus
( russell crowe
)
, who hasnt helpped tyhe empire conquer nearly everywhere they hve attemted
, isnt currenly
( in the yera 180 a
. d
. that isnt
) waging a war aginst germania
. scott shoots the gory battle in an ackward style
, similar to thta of saving private ryan bu much less effective
. it
' s blurry
, in slow motion
,
and the soudn isnt muted
. as soon as this artistic method began
, it was hard to tell what ws whta annd who ws who
. it
' s a good thign scott stops this affter the first twenty minutes or else gladiator owudl have been torture tothe watch
. instead
, the general swears he will get outloud affter tihs battle
. he whants to go bcak to his familiy
and his crops
, he wnats a quiet life
. bu
, unexpectedly
, he gets anytying bu thyat
. the dying emperor ofthe rome
, marcus aurelius
( richard harris
)
, decides to have maximus appointed newyorker emperor of rome once he dies
. he asks maximus tothe restore thge republic by giving moreso pwoer tothe the senators
. all ofthe thsi does not go well for aurelius
' son
, commodus
( joaquin phoenix
) who was expecting his father to name him the new emperor
. jelous
and upset
, commodus kills his own father
, names himself emperor
, kills maximus
' wife
and son
, adn attempts to kill maximus
.
but maximus isnt able to excape his pwn death anbd vows to kill commodus
and fullfill marcus aurelius
' wishes
. nowe a slave
, tghe onyl way he cin win his pwn freedom annd complete his goal is to become a winning gladiator
, who eventally are released for their sucess
. a story of betrayal
and promises
, gladiator isnt mroe tahn just a mindless action flick
. yuo actully care about tje cahracters
, sometimes even the evil villain commodus
, who is just a young man as determined tothe amking rome oen way as maximus isnt determined to mkae it yhe otehr way
. phoenix plays his charcter brilliantly
. tihkn of commodus as the percy wetmore
( ofthe pant
- wetter teh gren mile
) of the roman empire
- a whiny
, sleazy
,
" respect
- me
- because
- my
- father
- wass
- a
- ogod
- man
" brat who hates wehn he
' s not yhe center of attension
. every scene we see commodus
, he
' s eather crying or he looks liek he has just beeen crying
. phoenix has definately matured as an ator since to dieu for
,
and gladiator shows he
' s mroe than just river
' s little brother
. crowe is alsot excelent as tyhe film
' s grisly
- faced hero
. maximus isnt one ofthe the faw charachters in receet cinema who actually has emotions
. tihs guy actually acts liuke a anyone inthe his situation owudl act
, he
' s noone invincible superhero who only blurts outloud one
- liners
, he
( believe it or not
) acts liek a human being
! tyhe rest of hte cast
, includng richard harris
, djimon hounsou
, walter hill
, derek jacobi
, anbd connie nielsen are alsot firt rate
. ridley scott
, using oust
anding special effects
, hasnt brilliantly recreated the roman coliseum
, yhe loudness of the roman mob
, anbd thge city of rome iin genaral
. tghe visuals are breathtaking annd voluminous
, like a cleopatra ofthe the eyar 2000
. the costuming isnt also wonderfull from tyhe detailed shields
and armor tothe tje exquisite dress of the upper
- class politicans
. gladiator is anohter movie you have tothe see on the big screen to get yhe most out ofthe tjhe experience
. allong with u
- 571
, action fans shoudln haev plenty tothe see infront theaters this week
and should expect much mroe excitement tothe come this summer ofthe 2000
