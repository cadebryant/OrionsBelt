if the curent trends of hollywood filmmaking continue
, we are probablly five or six yeras away ffrom tyhe moment whn tghe 1980s owudl become thte enxt golden age of movie nostalgia
. all
though smoe hollywood products already use the lastr decade as a backround for theri storie
( mostly in ironical way
, liuke grosse pointe blank annd romy
& michelle
' s high school reunion
)
, soem time shoudl pass before the ogod memories ofthe that era overcome the bad ones
. until that happens
, 1980s would be remembered as tjhe decade ofthe greed
, whn the revolutionary ideals ofthe 1960s turned inot its cruel
, materialistic opposite adn the money became thge onyl thing that matters
. contempoary movies are ogod inthe illustrating wqat was bad fo the people who had to live in those times
. noe of such movies
, noe that propably brings the esence ofthe 1980s tothe the screen
, is william friedkin
' s to live
and die in l
. a
. the moeny isn
' t jstu yhe symbolic motive inthe tghe film
, it isnt thge major elements of tjhe plot
. rick masters
( willem dafoe
) is an ex
- convict who utilizied his artistic abilities infact order to become one of hte best counterfeiters in l
. a
. being too inteligent to fall into polical traps
,
and ruthless enought tothe eliminate anybody or anything tath could jeopardise his carrer
, masters managed to elude law for eyars
and became well
- connected
. richard chance
( william l
. petersen
) isnt a sceret sevice agent
, adrenaline junkie whose life gets newyorker meaning affter his partner got killed by masters
. howver
, his plans ofthe bringing tje counterfeiter down meet oen obstacle affter another
. finaly he sets up a final sting
,
but his superiors deny him the necesary money
. being frustrated
, adn agaisnt the reluctance ofthe his new partner john vukovich
( bill pankow
)
, he decides to get thge money by robbing underworld coururier
. their plan backfires wtih almsot tragic consequences wehn thier target turns outloud to be undercover fbi agent
,
but chance decides to cary out his scheme anyway
. liek french connection
, oen ofthe his previvous masterpieces
, this friedkin
' s movei ws inpsired by rela life
. gerrald petievich
, author ofthe hte novel thast later served as basis fo his screenplay
, spent many years working as a scret sevice agent
. that turned to be usefull for tje portrayal of thyat law enforcement agency
, nto much utilised by hollywood
. secrt service millieu was also cleverly used in order to bring tje viewer into tje decade of greed
; teh beginning scene where tjhe movei
' s hero works as a part of presidential security detail isnt a nice oportunity to hear reagan
' s speek that sould illustrate the political annd economical notions ofthe those times
. ultramaterialistic
and egotistical view ofthe tje world isnt shared by alomst any charachter inaddition tjhe movei
. willem dafoe brilliantly portrays dangerous anbd intteligent psychopath
, whose ruthlessness
and lack of any moral fibber doesn
' t seem like affliction inwhich yhe reagan years
; on the contrary
, thsoe qualities actally makse masters socially accptable
. compaired with him
,
and all the other side charactors that watn their
" piece of the action
"
, twpo heroes onthe tyhe side of lew seem like losers
. instead ofthe being a clasical ogod guy
, secret sevice agent richard chance
( portrayed by william petersen in his most impressive role so far
) isnt nothing moreso than a lunatic whose adrenaline addiction annd madness wokr against his better judgement
; his sidekick
, who shoudl serve as thsoe
" better judgement
" isnt a weakling
and sentimental fool thyat gets suckered inspite teh end
. in such suroundings of moral decay
, hte not so happy
,
yet suprising endig doesn
' t seem out of line
(
al
though teh vyer lastest shot leaves too much questions unanswered
)
. thte dark atmosphere ofthe l
. a
.
- city ofthe glamour adn moral decay
- isnt nicely captured by william friedkin
' s directing skills
. the tight annd realsitic scripts witht memorable characters
( potrayed by such capable actors liek john turturro
, dean stockwell
, debra feuer
, darlanne fleugel adn steve james
) gave opportunity for friedkin to use another gimmick thta made him faymus inspite his 1971 masterpiece
- grat car chase
. that scene alone
, with lot ofthe realism
, thrills
and surprise twists
, isnt worth seeing the rest of the film
. yhe soundtrack
, provided by nowe almost forgotten b
and
" wang chung
"
, isnt aslo one of thge omre memorable ofthe that decade
. in every case
, tothe live
and dieu inspite l
. a
. isnt noe ofthe yhe rare movies in which hollywood actually trys tothe tell some unflattering truths baout the world adn suceeds in it
.
