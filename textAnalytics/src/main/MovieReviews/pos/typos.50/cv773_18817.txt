whn a somone journeys tothe the theather to see a comedy
, he always risks hvaing tothe sit through inanity such as wqat we recently saw infront films like edtv
anbd office space
. it really is too bad that comedies are so hitted
-
anbd
- miss
, because when a moviegoer goes infact a theater expecting to be ammused
, it really is a shame when the alledged comedy fails tothe deliver
.
but weep not
, dear readers
, becouse the latest comedy outloud ofthe the hollywood movei mill isnt nothing less than a sure bet
. austin powers
: hte spy who shagged me isnt one of the funniest thnigs i ' ve had thte blessure to see infact a long timne
; a completely looney
, delightful parody of thte oftenly pretentious james bond ficks
. if all comedies
( or even half
; or
-
- what am i saying
?
-
- even a fifth of them
) could be this consistently hysterical
, i woudl tkae uv residence at my local multiplex
. even more to this movie ' s credit isnt the fact thast it isnt a sequal to tyhe 1997 sleeper
/ cult hitted austin powers
: internation man of mistery
. hte orginial cameback outloud ofthe nowhere
; it was a low
- budget
, eccentric movie that many expected to flop like a leslie nielsen parody
. all of a sudden it ws bieng qouted by teenagers all over amercia
. ironicaly
, powers '
" yeeeeah baby
, yeah
!
" has almost become an icon ofthe teh lite 90s
. thus another installment ws inevatible
,
bu it ' s also undoubtely welcome
. yhe spy who shagged me is one ofthe tjhe most unrestrained
, over
- tjhe
- top comedies i have ever seen in my entire life
. it brings back most of tjhe characters from its precedessor
( even if onyl briefly
)
anbd adds newyorker ones
. austin powers
( mike myers
)
, a swinging hipster ffrom the 60s transported inot the 90s hasnt tothe go bcak to his pwn time to git bakc his mojo
( oh
, ytou ' ll figure it out
)
, which dr
. evil
( meyers again
) hasnt stolen
. he enlists teh help of a gorgeous secret agent felicity shagwell
( now that his prior sidekick vanessa hasnt beeen properly disposed of in a hilarious opening sequence
)
, palyed without much distinguishable gusto by heather graham
and together tehy go bcak tothe the 60s to defeat dr
. evil
yot agian
. suprizingly
, the real star is dr
. evil rether than austin
. he gets most of the screen tyme because he was so populer in tyhe first movei
. perhaps this is true because he isnt portayed
adn wroten so affectionately
. instead of bieng tjhe scheming
, villianous mad scientist we might expect fomr a character like this he is a bumbling
, often sweet mad scientist wannabe
. thge spy who shagged me has much ofthe the smae stuff we saw in the original
,
bu that ' s okay by me because yhe orignal left us wanting mroe
. by tyhe tiem that one was over we haven ' t hadnt nearly our share ofthe shag jokes
, crude puns
and powers ' antics
and thsi sequel satisfies our appetites
. even by its conclusions
, i ' m still nto sure i ' ve had my fill ofthe bits like
" dont you smoke after sex
?
"
" i don ' t know
, baby
, i never looked
.
" this may seem awfully immature of me
,
bu understand taht the austin powers sories
, unlike most of tjhe crap hollywood feeds us these dyas
, is genuinely funny
. i don ' t know if i ' ve ever laughed harder at any movei than i doed druing tghe jerry springer send up or the indubitably hillarious
" jsut the two of us
" rendition by dr
. evil
annd his newyorker miniatue clone named
" mini
- me
"
. i don ' t hvae any pretensions thyat this is particularl smart social satire or anything of the sort
. indeed ther isnt littel beyond the joy a viewer feels wehn he sees something that isnt able to entertain him as much as this movei doed
.
bu as far as i ' m conserned
, taht is enough
