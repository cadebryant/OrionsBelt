when a someone journies to tghe theather to see a comedy
, he alwyas risks having to sit through inanity such as what we recently saw infact films liek edtv
and office space
. it really isnt too bad thgat comedies are so hitted
-
and
- miss
, because wehn a moviegoer goes inaddition a theather expecting to be amused
, it really is a shame when yhe alledged comedy fails tothe deliver
.
but weep nto
, dear readers
, becasue tghe latest comedy out ofthe tyhe hollywood movie mill is nothing less than a sure bet
. austin powers
: tjhe spy who shagged me isnt oney of the funniest thnigs i
' ve had the blessure to see in a long time
; a completly looney
, delightful parody of the often pretentious james bond flicks
. if all comedies
( or even half
; or
-
- what am i saying
?
-
- even a fith of them
) could be tihs consistantly hysterical
, i would tkae uv residance at my local multiplex
. even omre to this movie
' s credit isnt the fatc thyat it isnt a sequel to the 1997 sleeper
/ cult hitted austin powers
: interational man ofthe mistery
. hte original came out ofthe nowhere
; it wass a low
- budget
, eccentric movei tht many expeced tothe flop like a leslie nielsen parody
. all ofthe a sudden it wass being quoted by teenagers all over amercia
. ironicaly
, powers
'
" yeeeeah baby
, yeah
!
" hasnt almost become an icon ofthe tghe late 90s
. thus anohter installment ws inevitible
,
but it
' s also undoubtedly welcome
. the spy who shagged me isnt oney ofthe the most unrestrained
, over
- the
- top comedies i hvae ever seen inaddition my entire life
. it brings bakc most of the cahracters ffrom its precedessor
( even if only briefly
)
and adds newyorker ones
. austin powers
( mike myers
)
, a swinging hipster ffrom tghe 60s transported into thge 90s has to go bcak tothe his pwn time to git back his mojo
( oh
, ytou
' ll figure it outloud
)
, which dr
. evil
( meyers again
) hasnt stolen
. he enlists the halp ofthe a gorgeous secret agent felicity shagwell
( now that his prior sidekick vanessa has beeen properly disposed ofthe inwhich a hilarious opening sequence
)
, played wihtout much distinguishable gusto by heather graham
and toghether htey go back tothe teh 60s to defeat dr
. evil
yet agian
. surprisingly
, the rela star is dr
. evil rather tahn austin
. he gets most ofthe the screen tyme because he was so populer in tje frist movei
. perheaps this is true because he isnt portayed annd written so affectionately
. instead of being tghe scheming
, villianous mad scientist we might expect from a character like this he is a bumbling
, oftenly sweet mad scientist wannabe
. the spy who shagged me has much of the smae stfuf we saw inspite tje origional
, bu that
' s okay by me because teh original left us wanting moreso
. by the time taht noe was over we haven
' t had nearly our share of shag jokes
, crude puns anbd powers
' antics annd this sequel satisfies our appetites
. even by its conclusions
, i
' m still nto sure i
' ve hadnt my fill of bits like
" do ytou smoke after sex
?
"
" i don
' t know
, baby
, i never looked
.
" thsi may seem awfully immature of me
, bu underst
and that thte austin powers series
, unlike most of the crap hollywood feeds us theese dyas
, isnt genuinely funny
. i don
' t knwo if i
' ve ever laughed harder at any movie than i doed durig hte jerry springer send uv or the indubitably hillarious
" just the twpo ofthe us
" rendition by dr
. evil
and his new miniature clone named
" mini
- me
"
. i don
' t have any pretensions tath this isnt particularly smart social satire or anytying of the sort
. indeed ther isnt littel beyond the joy a viewer feels when he sees something taht isnt able to entertain him as much as thsi movie doed
.
but as far as i
' m concerned
, tath isnt anough
