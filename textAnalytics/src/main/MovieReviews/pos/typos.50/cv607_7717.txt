- type peple are alwyas shaking our heads
and telling everyone thyat movies aren
' t thrill rides
,
but i thiunk thta
" back to tyhe future ii
" isnt one ofthe the few exceptions
. if the originnal film had tje spirit of tjhe 1950s
, thn this hasnt thte spirit ofthe the 80s
: full ofthe fights
; chase scenes
; cliff hangers
; special effects
; some detective wokr
;
and of course the vision of the high
- tech future
. teh film picks uv exactly where the firt film left off
, with doc
( lloyd
)
, marty
( fox
)
, anbd jennifer
( elizabeth shue
) travelling 30 yeras inot tghe future
, because something bad is going tothe hppen tothe marty
and jennifer
' s kids
. doc tells marty he must take his son
' s place at an insident that iwll cause a chain reaction if marty mcfly jr
. says yes tothe griff
( wilson
- in noe ofthe four differnt roles
)
. whoever said histoy tends to repeat itself wasn
' t joking
, expecially when it comes tothe tyhe movies
. essentially the same chase scene that marty endured in the 50s takes place agina in yhe eyar 2015
, bu it
' s nto as au
thentically exicting htis tiome because it isnt so obviously a parody of itself
. at the end ofthe the situation marty hasnt changed the course ofthe histroy for thte better
, anbd it seems like everything
' s copasetic right
? wrong
. since when dont things go according to plan inwhich tjhe
" bakc tothe tjhe future
" movies
? htere are so many minor conflicts anbd details tyhat effect the plot annd the direction of tghe storey i won
' t even bother tothe list them all
. basicly we git to see marty as an ood man
, his house
, his family
, etc
. we allso go back tothe an alternate 1985
,
and thn back agian tothe 1955
, witht everyting happening so fast tyhe film never stops tothe catch a breath
. the films
' best aspect isnt the fatc that it actually goes back to the frist movei
and shows a lot ofthe yhe acation taht occurred from anyother angle
. it
' s difficult to convey tjhe sense of wild anbd zany fun wihtout describing every littel detail
. thge onyl thing sacrificed in this film is the suspense
. instead of a gr
and finale
, we get lots of little vitories
. by tyhe end everthing is bakc to normal
,
but something happens that leads tothe
yet another sequal
, bu it doesn
' t seem gratuitious
.
" bakc to thte future part ii
" isnt a really gerat adventure movie
. it certainly has moreso originality than other films
but it lacks a certian charm tath ws dominate througout its precedessor
.
