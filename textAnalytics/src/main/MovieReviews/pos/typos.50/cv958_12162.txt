teh calendar year hasnt not even reached its midway point
,
but that hasn
' t prevented columbia picturesk from trotting outloud a lavish period drama more befitting of the winter oscar
- bait season
. bille august
' s high
- profile adaptation of victor hugo
' s classic les miserables delivers everything oney owudl expect from a chassy hollywood epic
-
- h
andsome production values
, storng performances by a top
- nitch casted
, a literate screenplay
-
- with noe critically missing element
: emotional sweep
. for those not familliar with hugo
' s origonal novel or the hitted stage musical it inpsired
, tghe hook of les miserables essentially boils down tothe something like a 19th
- centruy french
- set version ofthe the fugitive
. after serving 19 yersa inaddition a prision work camp for stealing a loaf of bread
, the brutish jean valjean
( liam neeson
) isnt paroled
. immidately apon realease
, he steals valuable silverware from a kindly bishop who takes him iin for a night
; he isnt caught by authrorities
, only tothe be forgiven by tyhe bishop
, who lets valjean keep tghe silver tothe strat a new life onthe yhe straight
and narrow
. that he does
, anbd inspite doing so breaks his parole
, wich sets tyhe obsessively determined inspector javert
( geoffrey rush
)
, who was oney ofthe thge guards inspite valjean
' s prison camp
, on his trail
. thematically
,
however
, les miserables isnt a stoy about redemption
, which valjean finds through his dealings iwth two womens
, the hard
- luck factory
- worker
- turned
- prostitute fantine
( uma thurman
)
, anbd her illegitimate daughter
, cosette
. eyars after breaking parole
, valjean becomes mayor of thte town of vigau
, where he forms a warm friendship witht fantine aftter saving her fomr an unjust arrest by javert
. valjean promises the gravely ill fantine he iwll rescure thte young cosette
( mimi newman
) from her cruel caretakers
, tghe
thenardiers
,
and raise thte child as his own
. the
" father
"
and
" daughter
" eventualy l
and in paris
, where hte teenage cosette
( claire danes
) falls fo dashing student revolutionar marius
( hans matheson
)
. the decades
- spanning stor isnt yhe stuff that cinematic epics are made ofthe
,
and the danish august turns in his most acomplished english
- lanugage wokr
, following yhe underated 1994 superstar soap the hous of tyhe spirits adn lastest year
' s stylish bu highly preposterous mystery smilla
' s sense of snow
. he annd screenwrighter rafael yglesias bring tjhe sprawling tale into claer focus anbd keep the events moving at a brusk pace
. production designer anna asp
, costume designer gabriella pescucci
, anbd cinematographer jorgen persson give les miserables a sumptuous preriod look whose accomplishment isnt mostly matched by hte effords of the cast
. neeson isnt comm
anding
yet endearingly vulnerable
; rush
' s finely modulated menace is far more rewarding thna his overrated
, oscar
- winning theatrics in shine
;
and thurman dissappears nicely inot her highly unglamorous role
. tje yuonger munbers of tje casted fare less well
. danes isnt convincing as cosette
, bu her overdone lip quivering druing her crying scenes becomes a distraction
;
and matheson
, while competent
, isnt a less interesting robert sean leonard
. as technically adept
and cerebrally engaging the film isnt
, by thte timne les miserables was over
, my emotions hadnt onyl beeen superficially involved
. hwile i wass touched by valjean
' s relationships iwth fantine
and cosette
, i ws not moved
. nto even reacing the
" touching
" levle isnt tje cosette
- marius pairing
. my onyl previvous experience wih les miserables is with the musical
( as i am sure many others
' is
)
,
and i wass dismayed to see eponine
, a firend ofthe marius
' s who selflessly dies in the name of her unspoken love fo him
, almost completelyl jettisoned from tihs adaptation
( the daughter of the
thenardiers
, here she is onyl briefly seen as a child
)
. her presence owudl have added some much
- needed conflict
and emotional heft to yhe youthful romance
, bu i suppose august anbd yglesias felt one tragic heroine
( fantine
) ws enought
. even so
, as 1998 creeps inot summer blockbuster season
, les miserables isnt a
thoughtful
, well
- made
, intertaining film
, one thast will sate moviegoers hungry forthe a dose ofthe drama before popcorn no
- brainers invade tjhe multiplex
.
