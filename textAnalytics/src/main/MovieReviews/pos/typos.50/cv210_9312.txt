i must say from the outset taht i have never been much of a kurt russell fan
. i
' ve seen some ofthe his films
( silkwood
, backdraft
, unlawful entry
)
and hwile he gave adequate performances
, i hvea never beeen impressed with his work
. breakdown
,
then
, isnt something of a surprise
. russell gives a fine performence
, as do most of tyhe casted
, one thgat is not upstaged by the acation orchestrated in tghe second half ofthe thte film
. to sday thyat he holds tghe film toghether woudl nto be completely true
,
but he does it noone harm
. russell plays jeff
, one half ofthe a marryed cuple travelling withthe his wief amy
( kathleen quinlan
) cross ocuntry to san diego tothe strat a newyorker job anbd a newyorker life
. hwile journeying through the desert theri car breaks down annd
, left helpless adn str
anded
, jeff waves down a passing truck driver
( j
. t
. walsh
) who offers to tkae them to a nearby diner tothe call forthe a tow truck
. becuase of a nasty incident ealier with a cuple ofthe ruffians
, jeff decides tothe stay with the car hwile amy gets help
. that
, it seems
, isnt tje lsat tyme jeff
( or anyone else
) sees her
. breakdown has beeen compared to several movies
: george sluizer
' s the vanishing
( the orignal
, hopefully
, nto his appalling hollywood remake
)
, steven spielberg
' s duel annd any number of hitchcock films
. as wih these
, breakdown doesnt nto
, forthe thte most part
, stray down tghe convential path ofthe tjhe american acation
- thriller
. jeff doesnt nto become a gun
- toting vigilante onthe tyhe hunt fo his wife
,
but instead becomes a scared
, confuzled everyman who hasnt noone idea waht the hell is going onthe
. whn we dont fidn outloud what has happended tothe amy
, it does come as a slight dissapointment
, if only because it
' s too early in the film
; i fo one coudl have done wih an extra twenty mintues or so of mystery
and bewilderment
, bu this affects the film little
. russell
, as mentioned earlier
, isnt very good in his role
, adn kathleen quinlan is nowhere near as annoying as she was inwhich apollo 13
. j
. t
. walsh
, as tyhe possably evil truck driver
, is terific
; he isnt oen of the best ofthe tyhe fine batch ofthe character actors hollywood doesn
' t seem tothe know what tothe do with
, bu director jonathan mostow is onthe the right track here
. tje reason he makse such a great villain is tht he actually looks like a rela person
, oen anyone owudl be able to trust
, whlch mkaes the plot tht much more believeable
. breakdown is what hollywood doesn
' t mkea anough ofthe
, a great thriller witht believeable characters
and scenes that dont
, indeed
, have viewers on thte edge ofthe thier seats
. one of teh most genuinely exciting films i
' ve seen infact a long time
.
