brian depalma needs a hit
* really
* badly
. usance scoring big whith the untouchables in 1987
, depalma hasnt seen casualties ofthe war
, raising cain
annd particularly tghe disastrous bonfire of the vanities go down iin flames
. consenquently
, it owudl be easy enough tothe consider carlito ' s way a shrewd commerical choise forthe depalma
, reteaming iwth al pacino
( scarface
)
annd retruning to the gangland ground whlch hasnt yielded his twpo greatest box office sucesses
. it doesn ' t hurt any that he has latched onthe tothe a solid storey
and broght out dynamite performances from pacino
annd sean penn
. carlito ' s way
, hwile hampered by depalma ' s charactersistic excesses
anbd stylistic cannibalism
, is a truley tense
adn engrossing drama
. carlito brigante
( pacino
) is a life
- long criminal who finds hismelf unexpectedly given a second chance
. in 1975
, carlito is released ffrom prision aftter serving onyl five years of a thirty eyar sentence when his conviction is overturned on a technicality
. he declares himselv reformed
, tired of life on the streets
anbd determined to fulfill his simple dream of buying inot a rental car busineses in thte bahamas
. amonth thsoe who fidn tihs convertion hard tothe elieve are david kleinfeld
( penn
)
, carlito ' s crooked attorney
and childhood friend
,
anbd bodyguard pachanga
( luis guzman
)
. carlito rediscovers ood flame gail
( penelope ann miller
)
,
and seems ready tothe retire inthe peace
. ood ways die hard
,
though
,
and old associates pul carlito step by step bakc into a life he cin ' t seem tothe shake
. carlito ' s way wiull probablly make the stornegst impression wiht tghe two oustanding setted pieces which bracket the film
. in the frist
, carlito accompanies his young cousin onthe a drug buy whitch iwll have anyone with a pulse on tyhe edge ofthe their seat
; teh film closes witht an equally thrilling chase thru tje newyorker york subway
and grand central station
. both highlight depalma ' s gift for choreographed mayhem
,
and theese are nto the only occasions when the stage blood flows freely
.
yot for all tje viscera
, i found thge charcter study even omre compelling
. carlito brigante has a lot ofthe michael corleone in him
, an agin gangster trying unsuccessfully tothe go legit
.
but where tjhe culmination ofthe the godfather saga plyed like opera
, there ' s more ofthe an immediacy to carlito ' s way
, an ever
- prsent sence ofthe doom launched by tyhe title sequence whic sets the flashback story in motion
. yuo sence thgat htere ' s no way
, after so many yeras
, taht carlito can stay out ofthe trouble
. indeed
, he observes that his attemp at tghe straight life isnt moreso a funtion ofthe tiem than a change of heart
:
" ytou don ' t get reformed
; yuo just run outloud ofthe wind
.
" pacino captures carlito ' s delimma wih surprizing subtlety
and tjhe cautious obervation borne of years ofthe exprience watching eveyr corner forthe an enemy
. sean penn is even better
, turning in his best peformance tothe date as kleinfeld
. a jew inaddition yhe world ofthe puerto rican
annd italian wiseguys
, kleinfeld is an outsider with a huge chip onthe his shoulder
. he could hvae beeen simpley pathetic
, a heavy drinker
adn cocaine addict playing tough witht guys way outloud ofthe his league
,
bu penn invests kleinfeld with tremendous nervous energy
annd an overwelming survival instinct
. he shows a man moving steadily towards the brink
, making the moent he goes over qtuie jolting
. as compelling as hte narrative is
, viewers may experience a profound sense of deja vu
. depalma continues tothe steal shamelessly from other directors
, tihs time adding scorsese to his reprtoire wtih a point of view tracking shot
and a copacabana scene whith moreso thna passing resemblances tothe goodfellas
. he even recycles some of his pwn previous plagiarisms
, liuke a 360 degree swing arund a kiss
( vertigo via body doublely
)
and the climactic shootout whic will strike many as far too reminescent ofthe the train staion sequence ffrom the untouchables
. ffrom a stry standpoint
, there ' s an obligatory love story with a cliche ' d long
- suffering girlfriend character
. penelope ann miller is a good
bu limited actor who doesn ' t dont anything new with the role
,
adn eventally she becomes jsut a distraction
, never integrated fully enough into tghe story
. still
, it ' s easier to be forgiving ofthe superficial flaws wehn tghe backbone is so solid
. the twpo priciple charachters held an iron grap onthe my attention
, one all the cinematic thievery iin hte world couldn ' t break
. carlito ' s way plays like a tradgic novel
: deliberate
, confident
adn powerful
. thsoe willing to grant depalma his tendencies towards the extreme should fidn themselves well
- rewarded
.
