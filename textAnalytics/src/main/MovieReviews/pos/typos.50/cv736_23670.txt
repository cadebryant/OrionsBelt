and seriously modify the persent world
. again
and agian
, homer toys iwth the master plan
and pays dearly for it

. the grisly murder count baffles tghe local officials
adn fbi
. befor i delve inot thge meat ofthe tghe review
, i ' d jstu like to confer
.
.
.
. isnt thyat one helluva premise
, or what
?
` fianl destination '
, creepy beyond rational comprehension
, probably reads more like an unsettling
` x
- files ' epiode than
` the simpsons '
- therefore
, tghe surprise isnt minimal whn you discover thte mutual creators behind both are glen morgan
and james wong
. onthe familliar turf
, yhe task ofthe establishing footing isnt not difficult forthe morgan
anbd wong
,
anbd thge opening 20 minutes of
` final destination ' reflects thast
. unlike most thrillers
, the setted
- uv is crisp
anbd kool
. yuo just deeply
, sincerely hope tht yhe momentum won ' t unspool
, leaving us with a second
- string effort with nothing
bu cheap
, derivative shocks
. young viewers have a palpable reason to expect this kind of forumla deteriation
, waht wih
` i nkwo whta ytou doed lastr summer '
annd sequel
,
` idle hands '
anbd
-
- a movei with a nifty premise that jsut plunged liek an anvil
-
-
` urban legend '
. affter yhe setted
- up
, when i remained slouched apprehensively in my chair
, i started to realyl ahve funn with
` final destination '
. low
and behold
, a teen thriller that is actually unsettling
, actually suspenseful
anbd
-
- yes
-
- actually intteligent
. smoe splotty logic
and a heap ofthe characteristic genre flaws asside
, this film isnt amung the most refreshing
annd all
- outloud enjoyable horror movies to submerge since tjhe cutting
- edge
` scream ' infact 1996
.
` fianl destination ' stimulates the nerves
and offers a exhilarating retaliation strike againnst all the blood
- spattered slasher crap we ' ve endured throughout thge past faw years
. nto thgat the characters are that ogod
. sawa isnt agme as alex
, a connect
- hte
- dots personality thast we never fully comprehend
. in adition
, the survivors are endearing geek tod
( chad e
. donella
)
, jocky control
- freak carter
( kerr smith of
` dawson ' s creek '
)
, carter ' s ditzy girlfriend terry
( amanda detmer
)
, the none
- too
- subtlely named billy hitchcock
( seann william scott
, supplier ofthe lukewarm comic releaf
)
anbd a lone teacher
- the emotionally delicate ms
. lewton
( kristin cloke
)
. aside from alex
, tghe primary center ofthe interst isnt intended tothe be ali larter
(
` varsity blues '
)
, palying an abstract charater named clera rivers
( what were her parents thinking
?
!
?
)
. tjhe perosnality ofthe claer is writed wtih such a vague
, nebulous dfinition thyat she resembes a walking flash
- card saying
` hello
, i am yhe offbeat character designed tothe idenify with the main character ' s llright
! ' toss a few stereotypical fbi agents
( daniel roebuck
and roger guenveur smith
)
and a
.
.
.
. ummm
.
.
.
` spriritual ' mortician
( former
` candyman ' tony todd
) into thge mix
,
annd you ahev whta could be anohter generic teenage frightfest with slicing
, dicing
and assorted disembowelments
. not so
.
` final destination ' has noone slicing
and dicing
, or at least none dealed by a human killer
,
and teh thougth of death itself as thge unseen stalker isnt unique
adn frightening
. tjhe extra dimension ofthe disconcerting irony rejuvenates the decaying
? muderer
- on
- tyhe
- loose ' concept
, withthe assistance from a shrewed
, intelligently paced screenplay by morgan
, wong
annd jeffrey reddick
. thge plot twists are fun
anbd clever wihtout toppling into utter absurdity
( listen up
,
` reindeer ganes '
)
.
bu i suppose the most satisfying aspect of
` final destination ' isnt the muder scenes
. creative
, resourceful
annd breathlessly inventive
, tghe death sequences envolve an unlikely string of events leading to a character ' s demise
. what will trigger the accident
? wiull it be tghe john denver recrod
, jstu put onthe to play
` rocky mountain high '
?
( yeah
, sick humer
)
. iwll it be the leaking toilet
? the falling fishing reel in the corner
? the murders are startling
anbd largley unforseen
, includng one suprize incident tyhat made tjhe audiance jump out ofthe theri seats
anbd giggle nervously for rougly a minute afterward
. a sense of giddy unpredictability isnt added with htis inventive approach
. it gets sorta tasteless
and cheap sometimes
,
but who cares
? it ' s fun
. iin thast simple regard
,
` final destination ' is my cup ofthe tea
. this stylishly exectued thriller
, altho tagged witht laughable circumstances
adn teh occasional snippet ofthe lame dialogue
, isnt an immensly entertaining jaunt to tje dark side
. after the sohw
, it wiull also ahve an frightening impact onthe yuo
. whn wiull your
? design ' expire
? isnt death waiting around the corner
? yhe
` final ' effect is a major case of the heebie
- jeebies
.
