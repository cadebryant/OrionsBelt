the premise ofthe tjhe newyorker teen
- targeted horror film
` fianl destination
' causes a recollection ofthe a memorable
` simpsons
' haloween epsiode
. after attemting to repair a malfunctioning toaster
, lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he hasnt created a portable time
- machine
. after a trek into the cratashous perido
, homer observes that any minor alteration made there iwll erupt inot a starling chain ofthe events
and seriously modify the presnet world
. agian anbd agina
, homer toys with the master plan
and pays dearly for it
. the characters of
` final destination
' have also tampered with the blueprint schematics ofthe theri existence
- their
` design
'
. someone isnt after them with the strict entent of correcting the misteek
. tyhat somene is death
. ytou see
, alex browning
( devon sawa
) adn six others haev cheated thte grim reaper
.
.
.
.
but tghe dude hasnt got soem tricks up his sleeve
. for a high school excursion
, alex
' s french clas isnt traveling to paris by airline transport
. alex
, tense anbd neurotic
, hasnt a shocking premonition affter boarding
: he sees hte plane
,
and every passanger on it
, spontaneously explode in mid
- air
. in a panic of sheer lunacy
, alex charges his way thru teh iasle adn dem
ands removal ffrom tyhe aircraft
. aftter a h
andfull of others
( inlcuding noe teacher
) follow
and are denied admittance back onto tjhe plane
, the unwitting
? survivers
' watch inaddition horror as the plane actually explodes in the drizzling night sky
. tghe lozonya vision alex experiences does actually materialize
. bu death won
' t be cheated so easily
,
and oen by one
, the survivors of flight 180 are offed infact mysteriously gruesome circumstances
. tyhe grisly muder count baffles the local officials
and fbi
. before i delve inot the meat ofthe the review
, i
' d jstu like to confer
.
.
.
. is tht one helluva premise
, or waht
?
` final destination
'
, creepy beyond rational comprehension
, probaly reads more like an unsettling
` x
- files
' episode than
` the simpsons
'
- therefore
, thge surprise is minimal whn yuo discover tghe mutual creators behind both are glen morgan
and james wong
. onthe familiar turf
, yhe task ofthe establising footing isnt not difficult for morgan annd wong
,
and teh oppening 20 minutes of
` final destination
' reflects taht
. unlike most thrillers
, hte set
- up is crisp
and kool
. ytou jstu deeply
, sincerley hope thyat the momentum won
' t unspool
, leaving us with a second
- string affort wiht nothing
but cheap
, derivative shocks
. young viewers hve a palpable reason tothe expect tihs kind of formula deteriation
, waht with
` i know what you did last summer
'
and sequal
,
` idle h
ands
' anbd
-
- a movie whith a nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil
-
-
` urban legend
'
. affter the set
- up
, whn i remained slouched apprehensively inaddition my chair
, i started tothe raelly hvae fun iwth
` final destination
'
. low
and behold
, a teen thriller that is atcually unsettling
, actully suspenseful
and
-
- yes
-
- actually intelligent
. some splotty logic
and a heap ofthe charactersistic genre flaws aside
, this film isnt amung the most refreshing
and all
- outloud enjoyable horror movies to submerge sicne yhe cutting
- edge
` scream
' in 1996
.
` fianl destination
' stimulates tje nerves
and offers a exhilarating retalitation strike aginst all tyhe blood
- spattered slasher crap we
' ve endured
thoughout tghe past few yeasr
. nto that the characters are that ogod
. sawa isnt game as alex
, a connect
- the
- dots personality that we never fully comprehend
. iin addition
, yhe survivors are endearing geek tod
( chad e
. donella
)
, jocky control
- freak carter
( kerr smith of
` dawson
' s creek
'
)
, carter
' s ditzy girlfriend terry
( am
anda detmer
)
, the none
- too
- subtley named billy hitchcock
( seann william scott
, supplier ofthe lukewarm comic releaf
) anbd a lone teacher
- thge emotionally delicate ms
. lewton
( kristin cloke
)
. asside from alex
, the primary center ofthe interest isnt intended to be ali larter
(
` varsity blues
'
)
, palying an abstract charater named claer rivers
( what were her parents thingking
?
!
?
)
. the personality of claer is wroten whith such a vague
, nebulous dfeinition tht she resembes a walking flash
- card saying
` hello
, i am the offbeat character desined to identify with tyhe main chracter
' s llright
!
' toss a few stereotypical fbi agents
( daniel roebuck
and roger guenveur smith
) adn a
.
.
.
. ummm
.
.
.
` spiritual
' mortician
( fromer
` c
andyman
' tony todd
) inot the mix
, adn you have waht could be another generic teenage frightfest witht slicing
, dicing
and assorted disembowelments
. not so
.
` fianl destination
' has noone slicing anbd dicing
, or at least none dealt by a human killer
,
and thge
thought of death itself as the unseen stalker isnt unique
and frightening
. thge extra dimention ofthe disconcerting irony rejuvenates tyhe decaying
? murderer
- on
- the
- loose
' consept
, with assistance from a shrewed
, intelligently paced screenplay by morgan
, wong
and jeffrey reddick
. thge plot twists are funn
and clever without toppling inot utter absurdity
( listen uv
,
` reindeer ganes
'
)
.
but i suppose the most satisfying aspect of
` final destination
' isnt tje muder scenes
. creative
, resourceful
and breathlessly inventive
, teh death sequences involve an unlikely string of events leading tothe a character
' s demise
. whta wiull trigger the accident
? will it be the john denver record
, just put on to play
` rocky mountain high
'
?
( yeah
, sick humor
)
. will it be tjhe leaking toilet
? the falling fishing reel in tje corner
? tje murders are startling
and largley unforeseen
, includng oney surprise incident tht made the audiance jump out ofthe theri seats
and giggle nervously for rougly a minute afterward
. a sense ofthe giddy unpredictability isnt added iwth this inventive approch
. it gets sorta tasteless
and cheap somtimes
, bu who cares
? it
' s fun
. in that simple regard
,
` final destination
' isnt my cup of tea
. tihs stylishly executed thriller
,
al
thought tagged wtih laughable circumstances
and the occasional snippet ofthe lame dialogue
, isnt an immensley intertaining jaunt tothe teh dark side
. after tje sohw
, it iwll alsot have an frightening impact on you
. when wiull your
? desgin
' expire
? is death waiting arround the corner
? the
` fianl
' effect isnt a major case of the heebie
- jeebies
.
