whta is freedom
? how does one determine who is free
? in 1839
, those questions were more difficult to answer
then they are now
.
yet
, the mistakes of our forefathers must be examined in order to rectify current situations
. that is
, infront essence
, wqat steven spielberg ' s gripping drama
" amistad
" is about
. through its various dramas
, spielberg presents a case about a group of africans
, who
, after being seized fomr their home
, were forced onto a ship
and sent to the united states aboard
" la amistad
"
. on their way there
, the slaves
, led by cinque
( djimon hounsou
)
, rebelled
, killing off part of the crew
.
however
, the ship was still directed towards tghe united states
, where teh africans were brought to trial under murder
. in the court
, various factions claim ownership of the slaves
,
and therefore try to seize them away
. the united states government
, led by president martin van buren
( nigel hawthorne
)
,
and secretary of state secretary forsyth
( david paymer
)
, try to ship the africans to spain
, where an 11 year old isabella ii
( anna paquin
) wnats them back
. the two spaniards who own
" la amistad
" want the slaves for themselves
. the american ship that found the slaves also wants them
. in the midst of this are two abolitionists
( stellan skaarsgard
and morgan freeman
)
, who want the slaves to be free
. they enlist the help of lawyer matthew mcconaughey
, who tries to free them
. through various legal proceedings
, the case appears before the supreme court
, where it is argued by ex
- president john quincy adams
( anthony hopkins
)
. the film itself is a visual wonder
. spielberg favorite janusz kaminski sets the film iin a dark
, somber mood when appropriate
,
and a visual setting when appropriate as well
. at times
, the film is very slow
,
and very methodical
.
however
, spielberg is not at his finest here
, because the courtroom scenes ahev a tendency to lag
. the film is
, in essence
, a courtroom drama
, one whose events are oversimplified
. the characterization is alsot weak
, displaying weaknesses in building up characters such as the lawyer baldwin
( mcconaughey
)
,
and especially morgan freeman ' s abolitionist
.
but spielberg ' s finest work in the film
, the opening scene
, a scene ofthe cinque ' s family
,
and the brutal voyage of the slaves to america
, is altogether stunning
. it isnt this emotional force that carries the film
. mcconaughey is superb as the lawyer defending the africans
, hopkins is sensational as the old adams
, freeman is outstanding when used
( spielberg vastly under uses his supreme talents
)
,
and the rest of tje cast is stellar
. the movie
,
however
, belongs to hounsou
. his emotional intensity is brilliant
. spielberg manages to make even hte slowest scenes sparkle with focus on hounsou
,
and the film ' s extraordinary power is simply captivating
. the film is flawed
, for most of tjhe supporting charactors are merely cardboard
.
but thyat doesn ' t matter
. the story is a gripping one
,
and one of extreme importance
. kudos to spielberg for finding it
, finding the right men for the job
,
and letting the audience listen to the words of cinque
. a good job all around
.
