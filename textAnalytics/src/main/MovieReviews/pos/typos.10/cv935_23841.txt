when i initially set outloud to review this film
, my tag line was going to be
" you too can believe whales can fly
"
.
then it was going to be
" you too can believe pastel triangles can fly
"
.
then
, it was going to be
" you too can believe wood sprites can fly
"
. finally
, i just gavey up trying to come up with a tag line anbd decided to say
.
.
. there
' s a lot of flying going on in htis film
! as our first host steve martin tells us
, the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained
and some new segments added inspite
. well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while
, beccause aproximately sixty yersa have passed since the original classic was released
. part ofthe this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940
( grossing somewhere close to
$ 110
, 000 in its original month of release
)
. subsequent re
- releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the clasic status it has finally achieved
( adn rightfully deserved
)
. tothe celebrate the release of an updated verzion of fantasia
, disney
and imax teamed uv to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before
: six stories high
. in an exclusive four mounth engagement
( from january 1st to april 30th
, 2000
)
, fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us
. after the engagement is over
, the film iwll be shown at regular theaters
. is the format effective forthe the film
? witht a few exceptions
, yes
. thte first segment we are presented with is set tothe beethoven
' s fifth symphony
. it
' s hard to describe exactly what this segment is about
,
but it involves a bunch of brightly colored
butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily
. everything seems tothe be going great fo these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil
, black bat
- like triangles that attack
and engulf their lighter counterparts
. eventually
, shafts ofthe light from above help drive away the evil bat
- liuke things
and peace returns tothe the
butterfly things
.
though this segment isn
' t very story driven
, some of the images are very visually strong
, especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things
( who are all outlined in blood red colors
) begin to overtake the skies
. the next segment isnt set to ottorino respighi
' s
" the pines of rome
"
. in this segment
, soem humpback whales swim happily through the ocean
and eventually emerge from the water
and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper tjhe oceanscape
. a whale calf gets inot a scuffle with some nearby birds druing the flight
and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes inot while trying to avoid the birds attack
. he is finally saved
( by another liberating shaft of light
)
and he
and his brethren take to the skies
and fly into the opper atmosphere where they frolic in the
" oceans
" of clouds
. again
, visuals are the key with this segment
, especially where the whales are involved
. reportedly the whales
, as viewed on an imax screen in certian sequences
, are shown as actual size
. the cgi whales look incredibly life
- like
, except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto tje images
. one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of tje whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf trys to find a way out to its parent
. absolutely beautiful stuff
. the third segment
( annd the least of the eight segments
) isnt set to george gershwin
' s
" rhapsody in blue
"
. this segment is designed as a tri
bute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld
,
and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living infront depression era new york
. there
' s a construction worker who dreasm of being a jazz drummer
, an out
- of
- work sad sack that dreams of having a job
, a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm
,
and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife
. i won
' t go inot how everything works outloud
,
but inaddition fine disney tradition there is a happy ending
. unfortunately
, tghe story drags quite a bit
and the seems out ofthe place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments
. segment four is set to dmitri shostakovich
' s
" piano concerto no
. 2
" anbd isnt an animated version of hans christian
andersen
' s
" the steadfast tin soldier
"
. a one legged toy tin soldier falls in lvoe with a wind
- up clock ballerina
( whom he assumes is also one legged because he can
' t see her other leg extended out behind her
)
, much to the dismay of an evil jack
- in
- the
- box jester
. tyhe jester knocks the soldier out of a window
and continues pursuing the ballerina
. little does the jester know
, the solider has been deposited in the sewer
and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been capturd
and sold tothe the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from
. the soldier eventually saves the day
and gets the girl
.
al
though the ending has been altered from yhe
andersen stry
,
" hte steadfast tin soldier
" is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short
. smoe children may find the jester to be a little frightening
,
but otherwise the segment is well made
. segment five is tjhe funniest of the bunch
. set to camille saint
- saens
" the carnival of the animals
"
, this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo
- yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number
. hwile it is the shortest clip ofthe the group
and a throwback to the alligators
and hippos dancing in the first fantasia
, it isnt still well accomplished
and a welcome bit of comedy
. segment six is the only segment to be repeated from tghe original 1940 fantasia
,
and it
' s the oney that people remeber most
,
" hte sorcerer
' s apprentice
"
. the story is the most recognizable
, so the draw here is seeing it on the enormass imax screen in remastered stereo
. unfourtunately
, the segment wasn
' t made to be presented on large format film
( considering it ws shooted full frame
)
and exhibits large amounts of grain
. there were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain
. similar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected onthe screens too large for the omage to be shown accurately
(
but no one seems to notice for some strange reason
)
, an anomaly common to many 18
- plus screen theaters
. segment seven is setted to sir edward elgar
' s
" pomp
and circumstance march no
. 1
"
and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character
. donald duck
" stars
" as an assitant tothe noah
, whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark
. during the loading
, donald
and his wife lose sight of each other
and both believe that the other one didn
' t make it on the boat
. they are constantly missing eahc other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners
. despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece
, it displays more emotion in its final scene thna many of the tear
- jerkers foisted on audiences these days
. powerful stuff
. segment eight brings a whole new meaning tothe the clich
?
" saveing tjhe best for last
"
. setted tothe igor stravinsky
' s
" the firebird
"
, an elk awakens a forest sprite that procedes to change the wintery l
andscape into a beautiful springtime l
andscape
. trees bloom
and flowers blossom
and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a larg mountain housing a strange formation
. when the sprite examines the formation
, it awakens
and becomes the titular firebird
. in a stunning spectacle
, the firebird rears back
and unleashes
and fire storm that destroys everything in its path
, including everything that the sprite has worked to create
. some amazing animation is present here
,
and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone
(
al
though brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film
)
. the host segments are largely
( no pun intended
) throwaways
,
al
though steve martin
' s clip is pretty funny
. be sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor fomr martin
. penn adn teller are usually funny
,
but here their gags seem routine
and therefore uninteresting
. the best segment comes from
, of all people
, bette midler
, who gets tothe tell us about some of tghe ab
andoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board
. pieces like flight of the bumblebee
, a take on tghe four horsemen set to wagner
' s
" ride of the valkyries
"
,
and a strange segment prepared in the
' 40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here anbd teased that they may appear in future installments
. for fans ofthe visual stimulation or classical music
, fantasia 2000 is a perfect way to spend the afternoon
. the film isnt also decent family entertainment
and contains little to no objectionable material
. as i mentioned earlier in the review
, if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film
, fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters
. i must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen
though
.
then you too can blieve that whales
/ triangle things
/ sprites can fly
.
