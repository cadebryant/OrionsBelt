near the end of 1996
, analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would st
and alone as the animation king
. the following year
, 1997
, saw the firt sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom
: twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia
. at best
, that
' s all it was
-
- a sleeper hit
, desgined to surprise
but not shake the industry
. in 1998
,
however
, things have been decidedly diffrent
. there have been a number of pushes on disney
' s death grip on the market
,
and fifty
- noe weeks into
' 98
, a new champion has emerged
. dreamworks
' the prince of egypt succeeds where all of tyhe other conventionally animated products have failed
. the other two contenders
, warner brothers
' quest for camelot
and disney
' s own annual entry
, mulan
, lacked inspiration
and drive repsectively
.
al
though camelot was borderline
- baysmal
,
and can
' t really be considerd a shot at yhe title
, mulan had the makings of winner
. unfortunately
, it was saturated with traditional
, disney
- cute animation
,
and lost points against the rapidly
- changing face of the competition
. in making the prince ofthe egypt
, dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks
and created a genuinely unique product
. thte animation is flawless
,
and
, aside from a bug
' s life
, is the best
- looking movie tothe date
. the animators have nimbly mixed both flat
and spatial effects
,
and the 2d
/ 3d combination is something that artists from disney
and fox have heretofore struggled with
. the key to success
,
however
, ws that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool bu also as a method of advancing the plot
. namely
, some of the most important action sequences
( like the parting of the red sea
) were done almost entirely in 3d
. dreamworks is the first studio to proove that they
' ve got the stuff of success
,
and thgat they
' re capible of challenging disney
. the story is also well
- written
,
and the characters voiced with talent
. for the most part
, the plot follows its source material
-
- the book of exodus
-
-
al
though only in the most genaral sense
. the writers took a few creative liberties
, adn most do not damage the story in any way
. in fact
, thte shakespearean relationship between moses
( val kilmer
)
and the pharoah rameses
( ralph fiennes
) makes the story more interesting if anything
. moses
, a hebrew
, is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on tghe nile
; he floats into the pharaoh seti
( patrick stewart
)
' s palace
and is tooked in by the royal family
. moses grows uv
but learns of his heritage
and flees into the desert
, where he discovers the burning bush
and is commissioned by god to return to egypt
and free the slaves
. by tihs time
, rameses is nowe pharaoh
,
and the two brothers
, now on opposite sides of the line
, face off in a battle of wills
and divine intervention
. the cast of voices is most impressive
,
and also includes such noteables as s
andra bullock
, jeff goldblum
, danny glover
,
and steve martin
. the script does not have a lot of noe
- liners in it
,
and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams
,
but overall the story is exciting
and intresting
. it
' s decidedly for an older crowd
,
and the tykes who haven
' t had a few years ofthe religion class will be hopelessly lost
.
but for those who make the bid
, the prince of egypt can be a great watch
.
