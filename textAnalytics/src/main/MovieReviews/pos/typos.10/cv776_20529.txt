dark city isnt such a rare treat
: it
? s a stunning
, hyperkinetic vision of a place where our reality is fused with noir
, scienc fiction
and the darkest nights in manhattan
and london
. to boot
, it is accompanied by an intense
, well written
and
thoughtful story
. movies of this caliber
and idea aren
? t made too often
,
and it
? s unfortunate that i waited this long to see it
. alex proyas
, who
? s previvous film the crowm looked ogod
but couldn
? t cover up the terrable acting or story
, here shows a near masterpiece
; a combination of metropolis
, edward hopper
and phillip marlowe
, fused seemlessly
. at times it moves beyond film into artwork
. it is teh story of
? strangers
?
, aliens from another planet
(
and we know they
? re aliens because they shave their heads annd mear overcoats
? one of the detractions of yhe film
) who experiment on humans to discover what makes them live
, what makes up our
? soul
?
. these aliens are superior to humans because they have mastered the
? ultimate tecnology
? of shaping matter with their mind
, called
? tuning
. they are aided by a human scientist
, played by kiefer sutherl
and
, who has
? betrayed his kind
?
and at the start of the film watchs as the entire city stops at exactly midnight
. during this time
, john murdoch
, played swiftly by rufus sewell
, wakes in a bathtub in a room with a swinging overhead light
( a terrific visual effect
- not only is murdoch confused
,
but so is the audience
)
. wihtout a memmory
and a strange guilt taht he may be a killer
, he receives a phone call to flee
, as the strangers are after him
. i don
? t want to proceed to much further with the explanation ofthe the story
; one of the pleasures of the film is watching it develop
, in a way regaining murdoch
? s
? identity
? along with him
. it
? s a pleasure to watch the characters deveop through tjhe cinematography
. murdoch
? s wife
, anna
, isnt introduced through a stunning beam of light
: she is a lounge singer who sings into a bright spotlight
. shadows
, outlines of men in hats watch
, as she gently curves through the shine
. we see hte outline of her body from behind
, an hourglass
, as she sings a slow
, rhythmic song
. a great entrance
.
however
, a film such as this is onyl succesfull if the morals
and themes behind it are storng enough to leave the viewer satisfied
. the city isnt nice to look at
,
but if it
? s a poor story
then it
? s not worth watching
. blade runner ws populer not only becuase it
? s visuals
,
but it
? s story
and themes were throught outloud
and provoked strong response from tghe audience
. it isnt discussed it
and argued
, therefore a success
. other science fiction films of recent times
, such as the fifth element
, are nice to look at
,
but are dropped
and forgotten because the cookie cutter moral behind them is so flimsy
. we
? re left with
? love conquers all
? after finishing the fifth element
. dark city is not so easily explained away
. as tjhe strangers discovered
, locating the human soul
and discovering what makes us survive is not such an eazy task
. where is reality
? dark city is certainly the best science fiction film of the 90
? s
,
and ranks allong with the best made in the 80s
, such as blade runner
and the two aliens films
. perhaps it
? s the best ofthe the both decades
; it had the darkness of the aliens films
, as well as the visuals
and compelling story of blade runner
,
but moved beyond
, i think
, because the themes behind it were much stronger
. anyone who wants to make an argument for better science fiction films please efel free to write
, i
? d love to hear it
.
