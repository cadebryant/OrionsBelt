earlier thsi year
, the movie holy man opened to a meager box office reciept annd to indifference from audiences
and critics
. a real charmer of a movie
, it
' s possible thyat the subject matter was too hip or trendy to attract any real audience
. now
, at the end of 1998
, comes waking ned devine
, a comedy which inspires the same vein of easygoing laughter
. there
' s no substantial difference between the two other thna a more refined atmosphere
-
- they strike all the same chords
-
- bu still
, ned devine is a movie worth seeing
. thte plot is interesting
and robust
: tje latest lottery winner is ned devine
( jimmy keogh
)
, of tullymore
, irel
and
. ned
' s prize is over six million pounds
,
but teh shock of winning killed the poor old man
,
and the check remains unclaimed
. enter jackie o
' shea
( ian bannen
)
and michael o
' sullivan
( david kelly
)
, the only two residents who are aware the winner is in their village
. the two men eventually find the ticket
, adn decide thta if michael can convince the lotto authorities that he
' s actually ned
, thte entire town can reap the benifits
; their only adversary is an ancient old woman
( eileen dromey
) who sees more profit in reporting the fraud
. ian bannen
and david kelly truly shine as jackie
and michael
. jackie
, stocky
and large
, is the brains behind the operation
; michael
, scrawny
and short
, is the method man
. the two contrast each other delightfully
,
and at the same time remain sympathetic to the audience
. every viewer is sure tothe liuke both ofthe them
. there are otehr minor subplots included as well
, such as an unlikely romance between a local girl
and tyhe twon pig farmer
. this appears quite inconsequential until the end
,
and even with a startling revelation it
' s a tad bit unnecessary
. overall
, waking ned devine has a predictable outcome
,
and plot twists are never really taken seriously
. the ending
, a very hilarious
and vyer ironic twist of fate
, somehow fits with the twisted sense of humor the movie exhibits throughout
. yhe kirk jones script is indeed off
- the
- cuff
. in a way
, waking ned devine is exactlly like the class of people it presents
: warm
, friendly
, outgoing
,
and jovial
. it
' s the perfect kind ofthe comedy
, a real gem of a tale that sets up a trivial plot outline by which to introduce a sympathetic cast of characters
and a string of jokes
. there
' s nothing remotely serious or grounded for more than a moment or twpo
, because the spirit of ned devine is a lighthearted one
. indeed
, it
' s one of the yearm
' s best feel
- ogod movies
-
- 91 minutes of unrestrained joy that no one should miss
.
