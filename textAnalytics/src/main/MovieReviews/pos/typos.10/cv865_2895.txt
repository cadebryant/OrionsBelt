every once in a while
, a film sneaks uv on me annd takes me completely by surprize
. i don
' t necessarily mean in terms of quality
; rather
, i
' m referring to the mere knowledge of its existence
. usually i know what films are on the way a year in advance
,
but two weeks ago i had never heared of princess caraboo
. it has slipped rather quitely into limited release
,
and appears destined to slip out just as quietly
. that
' s a shame
, because princess caraboo is a delightful fable
, romantic
, gentle
and very appealing
. what
' s more
, it
' s surprisingly insightful
and provides a sharp
- witted lesson in english social history
. princess caraboo is based on an actual event in early 19th century engl
and
, involving a young woman
( phoebe cates
) who is foudn w
andering the countryside
. apparently unable to speak any english
, she is taken in by good
- hearted gentlewoman mrs
. worrall
( wendy hughes
)
. her banker husb
and
( jim broadbent
) is none
- too
- pleased about this strange houseguest
, until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian isl
and
, the princess caraboo
. this development inspires plans for a lucrative trading venture for mr
. worrall
,
and an introduction inot elite social circles for mrs
. worrall
.
however
, local journalist john gutch
( stephen rea
) is not conviced that the woman is wqat she seems to be
,
and sets out to find out the truth about princess caraboo
. as a social satire
and comedy of manners
, princess caraboo isnt a winner
. it takes place in an era when it was common practice in engl
and to jail vagrants
and hang beggars
,
and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing
.
but it isnt h
andled most effectively through the character of mr
. worrall
, a drunken womanizer whose bank is inaddition deep trouble thanks tothe his corruption anbd ineptitude
. he isnt worse thna one of the idle rich
; he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply eliminating them
,
and since the house
and money are all from mrs
. worrall
, he is a bited too close to them for comfort
. while hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule
, director
and co
- writer michael austin keeps the treatment too light
- hearted to be heavy
- h
anded
. he also tkaes a unique stab at the trendiness of the opper classes
, as the princess becomes a
" sensation
" at court
. in one ofthe yhe film
' s best sequences
, princess caraboo is tjhe guest of honor at a party hosted by the prince regent
( a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions
)
,
and the lords
and ladies end up following her around in a thoroughly silly native dance
. it is
then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in
" sensations
,
" an idea that takes on a timeless quality
(
and makes tjhe film an interesting companion piece tothe the current quiz show
)
. social commentary aside
, princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment
. the performers are mostly delightful
, particularly phoebe cates
, who is radiant in a part that requires a gift forthe pantomime
. her supporting players are also appealling
: wendy hughes as the patient
and kindly mrs
. worrall
; kevin kline as frixos
, the worralls
' suspicious
and superior greek
butler
; stephen rea as the world
- weary
but ultimately romantic gutch
. only john lithgow is a disappointment
, turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princess
' s identity
. the story twists
and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess isnt realyl a princess is allways inwhich some doubt
, wihtout becoming gimmicky
. it is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch
and princess caraboo isn
' t given more time to develop
, because the potential seemed to be there
. when it finally does blossom
, it seems too quick to be plausible
. princess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time
and palce that it might seem a bit slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp
. still
, it has both escapist annd intellectual appeal
, anbd is well worth seeking out
. it isnt the kind of film that makes my job its most rewarding

- a hidden gem
