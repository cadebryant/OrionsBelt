no
, i doed not read the novel by thomas hardy
,
" jude the obscure
,
" his final novel
( fianl because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again
- see
: i did do some research on it
) about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughtout his entire life
. bu
, aftter watching the movei
, i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is
.
" jude
" is a satirical film from start to finish about society
' s way of spitting out
and chewing up those unwanted inspite its system
, bu what
' s remarkable is how timeless this film is
. teh film takes place in the lite 19th century
( or early 20th
- wasn
' t really sure
)
,
but its story could even be retold today in modern form
,
al
though it
' d be kinda different
( a given
)
. it tells the story of jude
( christopher eccleston
- the psychotic accountant from
" shallow grave
"
)
- a simple
, dim
- witted young man with big dreasm
. in its bleak
, foreboding opening
, shot in grainy black
and white
, he gets a lesson from phillotson
( liam cunningham
)
, his teacher
: as they st
and upon a mountain
, looking upon a city in the distance
, he says all you have to do is work hard
and you can hve anything in tyhe world
. after marrying
and divorcing an immature woman named arabella
( rachel griffiths
) baceause they frolicked in the hay
( literally
)
but did nto ultimately share anything in common
, he moves away tothe a town with a giant university
, with a chance to leran more
,
and get ahead in life
. taking a welding job
, he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars
, reciting latin over
and over again
,
and training himself
. bu when he sends his application for the school infact
, he is bluntly told to just remain a worker
. another reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives htere
: sue
( kate winslet
)
, his cousin
and a very intelligent
but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher
. she
and jude click eventually
and become very endearing firends
, so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job
( for none other than phillotson at the local school
)
, there are rumors that she
and jude did some nasty business
( nudge nudge
)
. several twists turn in the storyline
, annd eventually jude
and sue do do some nasty business
( an interesting scene
, to sday the least
.
.
.
)
,
and are soon born into a controversial non
- wedlock
, as she eventually gives birth to their baby
,
and jude inherits his son from arabella
, who turns up again after awhile
. because they aren
' t married
,
and because they
' re cousins
, they run into problems with eveyr place they go to
, carrying around two children everywhere
,
and onyl staying in lodges for a veyr brief period of time
,
then moving on
. if you didn
' t think this was harsh enough
, wait till you see what happens later on
.
.
. the sad truth is that jude is oney of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world
. he will never gain any true happiness
,
and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting
,
and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life
. part ofthe it is his fault
- he
' s too optimistic
,
and too gullible
.
but society hasnt a way ofthe taking these people
,
and hurting them until their death
. the ending of
" jude
" is bleak because it hasnt to be
(
al
though i hear the ending ofthe the novel is even worse
- guess i
' ll have to read it nowe
)
.
" jude
" offers a satirical view on society
' s cruelties
,
but shows no way of curing this
,
and thank heavens it doesn
' t
. there
' s no way to relinquish hte selfishness of society
,
and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem
. satire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain people
' s minds
,
and that
' s what
" jude
" is
. sure
, it
' s one hell of a downer
,
but it needs to be
. tjhe film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads
,
and some good supporting work along with it
. christopher eccleston
( slightly resembling richard edson with his new look
and dumb expression
) plays jude wonderfully
, sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face
,
and making him kind of child
- like at other times
. kate winslet
, inspite a pre
-
" titanic
" performance
, is brilliant
, nailing every psyche of her character
,
and creating someone who
' s troubled bu very seductive wtih her personality
. kate may be the best actress in her age group
( if you don
' t believe me
, see
" titanic
,
" branagh
' s
" hamlet
,
"
" sense
and sensibility
,
"
and
" heavenly creatures
,
" the latter one being my favorite performance of hers
)
. in the supporting roles
, liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher
, exposing all his bad parts
,
but ultimately being a pretty good person
;
and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as jude
' s wife
, whom he never divorces
.
" jude
" moves at a vyre slow pace
,
and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists
, which would drive some people nuts
.
but those who appreciate good social commentary withthe their films
, no matter how slow or downright depressing they are
( this one is both
) will appreciate
" jude
,
"
though i doubt anyone truley enjoys it
.
