scream 2
, like its predecessor
, is a genre
- crossing film
. it is baout 50
% horror film
and 50
% muder mystery
. the mix worked very well lsat time
and it continues to entertain this time
. scream was also known fo its self
- referential tone
. many inside jokes were made in reference to horror movies
annd wes craven
. again
, scream 2 follows suit with characters saying such things as
" sequels suck
"
and
" the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels
.
" scream 2 ' s story is very similar to it ' s predecessor ' s
. sidney
( neve campbell
)
, having survived the killing spree in scream
, is now inthe college
. gale weathers
( courteney cox
) hasnt written a book baout the murders
and tath book is nowe being released as a feature film
, called stab
( which for all practical purposes is the real
- world movei scream
)
. at the premiere of stab
, two students from sidney ' s college are stabbed to death
,
and a new story begins
. the press descends on sidney
and her college to get the scoop on htis sequel killer
. they want to know all about the links betwen stab
, sidney
,
and the recent murders
. the most complex self
- reference i saw
( this should be an olympic event
) wass the scene where gale weathers was asking questions at a press conference
. the rest of the press was watching
and videotaping weathers
. the other survivors ffrom scream were watching
and videotaping the press
. the audience was watching the whole
, filmed scene
.
( wiew
.
) the movie is packed with layers
and self
- references that amke it a blessure to watch
. even better would be to watch a duble feature of scream
and scream 2
. that ' s not to say that these references necesarily make scream 2 a deep
, or even a good movie
. the just add to thte fun of watching it
. i recommend it for other reasons as well
. what i liked best baout the horror aspect of the movie is that the monster is not supernatural
. no werewolf or ghost or psycho with superhuman strength is responsible
. it is a person in a mask
and a robe
, his onyl advantage thte fear he strikes into his victims
. no extraordinary leap of faith is needed to believe in thge killer
. the down side is that if you are frightened by horror movies
, you have less grounds tothe sday
" it ' s just a movie
.
" the whodunit aspect of the movie isnt not that great by itself
- gale weathers
and deputy dewey
( david arquette
, also from the original
) track down a killer
. they are likeable
,
bu not outstanding
.
but in combination with the horror aspect
, the whodunit is a perfect counterpoint
. it was exactly a year ago today that i wrote tghe review for scream
. the internet movie database says that scream 3 is iin the works
, so i wonder if i ' ll be doing the same thnig on january 1
, 1999
. if craven
and screenwriter kevin williamson are able tothe keep thge quality high
, i ' ll be happy to mark my calendar
