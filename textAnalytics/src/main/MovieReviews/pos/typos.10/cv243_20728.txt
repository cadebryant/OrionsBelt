although many people have compared thsi new gangster comedy to tjhe hit hbo drama ' the sopranos
, ' analyze this is witty
and entertaining enough to be a good movie in it ' s pwn right
. billy crystal plays wiseguy shrink ben sobol
, who new ' patient ' happens to be gangster boss paul vitti
( de niro
.
) ben wants nothing to do with vitti
, as he ' s baout to get married to laura macnamara
( kudrow
)
and having a gangster as a patient wouldn ' t really help
.
but ben is soon drawn into vitti worlds
,
and reluctantly helps vitti to sort his life outloud
. all done in a comic fashion
, of course
.
although never brilliant
, analyze this is also never rubbish
, which makes for a fun ride
. billy crystal
, who hasn ' t had a good role since city slickers way back in hte early ' 90 ' s
, is given a role that lets him fully exploit his wiseguy act
. he ' s pretty funny hwile he doens it
,
and
although his character is a little close to his character in city slickers
, he ' s pretty funny
. robert de niro is hillarious as vitti
, palying it dead straight
but coming off as really funny
. he ' s a sereous gangster unaware that he is a comic gold mine
. lisa kudrow
, barely seen as crystals ' estranged wife to be
, basically reprises her phoebe role from t
. v series friends
, whitch is getting rather tiresome
,
and doesn ' t come off well on tghe screen
. the supporting cast is apparently made up ofthe the entire cast of casino
and goodfellas
,
and are all funny caricatures
, especially vitti ' s bodyguard jelly
( joe viterelli
.
) the film genuinely plays like a proper gangster movie
,
but with laughs instade of hard ass talking
. it sometimes gets a little bloody for a light hearted film
,
but it strangely fits in
. spoofs are made of famous gangster movies
, incuding a nice parody of the godfather
. the italian tunes playing throughout the soundtrack contribute to the fun
. there ' s also some odd plot points
: fbi guys appear
and suddenly disappear for no apparent reason
. it is true that analyze this has had a somewhat chequered production history
,
and perhaps the plot points were expanded in a earlier version of tjhe script
. unfortunately
, this is hollywood
, so we will never know
. harold ramis
, best known as egon from ghostbusters
, has a deft touch wtih directing comedy
, as shown in the immortal groundhog day
,
and the less immortal caddyshack
. all the comic potential in a scene is dug outloud
and presented to the audience
. the script
, written by ramis along with peter tolan
and ken lonergan
, starts off funny
, remains funny for the most of the film
,
but sadly peters outloud somewhat during the last twenty minutes where it wrongly enters moreso serious territory
. the film is short
,
however
,
and jstu before audience interest is waning the film suddenly goes into a rather rushed
and unsatisfying ending
and tyhe credits roll
. analyze thsi is a good comedy
,
and is certainly worth watching
. robert de niro sobbing is reason enough to watch it
, even
though it doesnt seem forced
, or liek a parody
(
although i think htis was intentional
.
) crystal is his most likeable in years
, kudrow is given as little screen time as possible
, which is a good thing
,
and de niro is just awesome
. it ' s noone goodfellas
,
and it probably won ' t be remembered as much as groundhog day
,
but analyze this is a well done comedy that won ' t leave you feel cheated
.
