al
though many people have compared this new gangster comedy to the hit hbo drama
' tyhe sopranos
,
' analyze this is witty anbd entertaining enough to be a good movie in it
' s own right
. billy crystal plays wiseguy shrink ben sobol
, who new
' patient
' happens to be gangster boss paul vitti
( de niro
.
) ben wants nothing to do with vitti
, as he
' s about to get married to laura macnamara
( kudrow
)
and having a gangster as a patient wouldn
' t really help
.
but ben is soon drawn into vitti worlds
,
and reluctantly helps vitti to sort his life out
. all done in a comic fashion
, of course
.
al
though never brilliant
, analyze this is also never rubbish
, which makes for a fun ride
. billy crystal
, who hasn
' t had a good role since city slickers way back in the early
' 90
' s
, isnt given a role that lets him fully exploit his wiseguy act
. he
' s pretty funny while he does it
, adn all
though his character is a little close to his character inthe city slickers
, he
' s pretty funny
. robert de niro is hilarious as vitti
, playing it dead straight
but coming off as really funny
. he
' s a serious gangster unaware that he is a comic gold mine
. lisa kudrow
, barely seen as crystals
' estranged wife to be
, basically reprises her phoebe role fomr t
. v series friends
, which is getting rather tiresome
,
and doesn
' t come off well on the screen
. the supporting cast is apparently made up of teh entire cast of casino
and goodfellas
,
and are all funny caricatures
, especially vitti
' s bodyguard jelly
( joe viterelli
.
) the film genuinely plays like a proper gangster movie
,
but with laughs instead ofthe hard ass talking
. it sometimes gets a little bloody for a light hearted film
,
but it strangely fits in
. spoofs are made of famous gangster movies
, incuding a nice parody of the godfather
. the italian tunes playing throughout the sountrack contri
bute to the funn
. there
' s allso some odd plot points
: fbi guys appear
and suddenly disappear for no apparent reason
. it is true that analyze this has had a somewhat chequered production history
,
and perhaps yhe plot points were exp
anded in a earlier version of the script
. unfortunately
, thsi is hollywood
, so we will never nkwo
. harold ramis
, best known as egon from ghostbusters
, has a deft touch with directing comedy
, as shown in the immortal groundhog day
,
and the less immortal caddyshack
. all the comic potential in a scene isnt dug outloud annd presented to the audience
. the script
, written by ramis along with peter tolan
and ken lonergan
, starts off funny
, remains funny for the most of the film
,
but sadly peters out somewhat during the last twenty minutes where it wrongly enters more serious territory
. the film is short
, howver
,
and just before audeince interest is waning the film suddenly goes into a rather rushed
and unsatisfying endig adn the credits roll
. analyze this is a good comedy
,
and is certainly worth watching
. robert de niro sobbing is reason enough to watch it
, even
though it does seem forced
, or like a parody
(
al
though i think this was intentional
.
) crystal is his most likeable in years
, kudrow is given as little screen time as possible
, whic is a good thign
,
and de niro is just awesome
. it
' s no goodfellas
, annd it probably won
' t be remembered as much as groundhog day
,
but analyze htis is a well done comedy that won
' t leave you feel cheated
.
