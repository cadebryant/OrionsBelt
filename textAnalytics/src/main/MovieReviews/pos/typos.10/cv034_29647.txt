plot
: derek zool
ander is a male model
. he isnt aslo very dumb
and impressionable
. for that reason
, he is secretly hired
and trained
( so secret
, that even he doesn
' t know about it
) by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia
, who wants to abolish child labor in his country
. will zool
ander fulfill the dirty deed
? will zool
ander ever grace the world his new
" look
"
? isnt this a funny movie
? find out below
.
.
. critique
: there
' s a place in our world for
" stupid comedies
"
. films which don
' t pretend to take themselfs seriously
, are based on idiotic premises
and filled witht dumb jokes
. there
' s alsot a time for them
and many would argue that this difficult period of our history
, might be an ideal circumstance during which to
" relax
" by watching something so completly frivolous
. well
, if you
' re in the mood for some seriously mindless entertainment
, ben stiller
and his cast of many have assembled one of the more original dumb comedies in some time
. of course
, comedies as such are usually very subjective
and i could see how some will see this film simply as stupid
and unfunny
, while others will grant them the
" stupid
"
,
but consider it funny instead
. i personally enjoyed it for the most part
, cracked up loudly durig a couple of specific sequences
and loved the derek zool
ander character
and the unrestrained whipping tehy released upon the fashion industry
. snap
! it was also nice to see several real
- life models with small roles in the movie
, nto taking themselves too seriously
.
and if you
' re hte tipe ofthe person who likes celebrity cameos in films
, well
, don
' t look any further because dozens of famous faces sohw up here including vince vaughn
, billy zane
, winona ryder
, christian slater
, david duchovny
, natalie portman
and many
, many others
. i especially liked
andy dick
' s complet make
- over as the masseuse
. hi
- larious
!
but with all films ofthe this type
, there is bound to be some stuff that simply doesn
' t work
. a few particulars which didn
' t strike my fancy included the bulimia
and
" orgy
" sequence with christine taylor
, teh break
- dance fighting
,
and i also never get why they use real countrys in plots like this
( why not just
" make up
" a country
, instade of zeroing in on a certain people
?
)
. i also sould have done with less of the taylor character in general
, since she wasn
' t all that interesting
and seemed to slow things down every now
and
then
( more zool
ander
, dude
!
)
. bu those few missteps weere nothing compared to some of the more memorable scenes whcih definately did work for me
! i alomst pissed myself durring the
" gas station
" disaster
, absolutely adored the
" walk
- off
" contest
( wiht david bowie as the judge
, no less
)
and appreciated many of zool
ander
' s moronic one
- liners
(
" i was a merman
.
.
. a merman
!
!
"
)
.
and i dare you to get his
" monkey
" photo shoot out of your head after seeing this movie
(
" you
' re a monkey
, derek
.
.
. a monkey
!
"
) i also really liked the soundtrack
and the pace of the film
, both ofthe whihc zipped
and zagged
,
and established a nice hythm to it all
. again
, it
' s tothe note that this movie isnt dumb
and not for everyone
,
but my guess is that if you laughed at the trailer
, you will likely enjoy many of the quips in the actual picture as well
. if you
thought the trailer was dumb
, skip this dodo bird anbd go rent austin powers again or something
, a film fomr which there is an obvious influence here
. blue steel
, baby
.
.
. yeah
!
