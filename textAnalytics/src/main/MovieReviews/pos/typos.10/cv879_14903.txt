labelling is sometimes everything
. in original mad max
, the opening title set the plot of teh movie in near future
, thus making it one of the science fiction classics
, despite the future world bieng almost exactly like our own
. walter hill wanted the same opening title for his acation classic the warriors
. producers weren
' t thrilled by that idea
and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones
. on the other h
and
, producers were right on the mark
; walter hill was accussed of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america
. to amking the movie even more distant from future
, plot was loosely based on anabasis
, historical book written by xenophon
, greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia 2400 years ago
. instead of ancient persia
, movie begins in contemporary coney isl
and
, where cleon
( dorsey wright
)
, leader of the warriors
, local youth gang
, gets invitation to the gerat gathering of all youth gangs from tghe city
. the gathering
, organised by gramercy park riffs
, most powerfull gang in the city
, is taking place inspite bronx
. tyhat is far away from warriors
' home territory
,
but small
and unarmed delegation of tyhe warriors gets there safetly thanks to the general truce
. on the gathering
, cyrus
( roger hill
)
, charismatic leader ofthe the riffs
, announces his gr
and plan to unite all the gangs
and take over the city
. crowd is enthusiastic
,
but the small gang of rogues
, led by psychopathic luther
( david patrick kelly
) uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus
. police simultanously raids the gathering
,
and in yhe commotion warriors get blamed by the killing
,
and their leader gets killed by riffs
. the remaining eight
, led by cleon
' s lieutenant swann
( michael beck
)
, must now try to get to coney isl
and
,
but this time unprotected by truce
and instead being chased by all the gangs
. upon its release
, dispite the controversies
and even some youth riots that weere allegedly inpsired by it
, the warriors enjoyed immense popularity
and very quickly received some kind of a cult status
.
however
, despite being one of the best movies of that year
,
and being directed by talented acation director walter hill at the peak of his career
, thge movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic acheivments of that same yearm
. the reason for that probably lies in a fact thyat this movie aged very quickly
. if walter hill
' s idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america
, he failed miserably
. the future was much worse than his vision
. tjhe youth gangs
, as presented in the warriors
, are far from shadowy armies
, able tothe tkae over entire cities
. their members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion
and their little petty feuds than such prosaic
,
and for the publich more annoying
, matters like crime
. in their vocabulary
, word
" arms
" is reserved for small knives annd blunt objects
, adn only few ofthe them use heavy artillery like h
andguns
. they even have their own
, very strict
and detailed laws
, upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own
. many people in american cities would be more than happy to see theri young criminals behaving like those in the warrriors
. some of the criticists who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour
. despite those objections
, the warriors have all the elements of a very good film
. the plot is simple
,
and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes
. the fights are brilliantly choreographed
and quite realistic
,
al
though ther isn
' t much bloodshed or gore in the movie
. editing is superb
, events happen at quick pace
, with the exception of middle
, when boring moralistic exchanges between swann
and his would
- be
- girlfriend mercy
( deborah van valkenburgh
) drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory
. the soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive
and recognisable
.
yet
, the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent
,
al
though most of them later sunk into anonymity
. best known of them is david patrick kelly
, whose superb
and original performance in this film later subscribed him tothe the roles of psychopathic villains
. michael beck as cool
, almost statesman
- like leader ofthe a gang
, is also very ogod
, annd james remar gives good contrast as his hot
- shot contender for top spot
. all in all
, this movie is perheaps dated
,
yet in its hour
and half can give a lot more entertainment thna most of the contemporary movies
.
