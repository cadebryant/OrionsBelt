with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink
, the films of joel
and ethan coen fit into two broad categories
: quirky
and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the
" film noir
" genre in which crime schemes go wrong
and spin increasingly out of control
( fargo
, miller
' s crossing
, blood simple
)
,
and off
- the
- wall comedies centered around an eccentric
, scatter
- brained lead character
( raising arizona
, the hudsucker proxy
)
. their latest offering
, the big lebowski
, falls withing the latter category
,
though ther are elements of the crime
- gone
- wrong theme
and even a touch of satire tothe be found in this film
. the main difference
,
however
, is that while the protagonists of raising arizona
and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations
and ideals
but didn
' t quite hvae the brains tothe get it all together
, the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who
' s wise to the world
,
but he doesn
' t really wnat to do much of anything besides go bowling
, smoke pot
,
and generally relax
. that main character is jeffrey
" the dude
" lebowski
( jeff bridges
)
, intruduced by thge film
' s rambling narrator
( sam elliott
) as
" quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county
.
" the dude is unemployed
, needless to say
,
and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends
, walter
( john goodman
)
, a borderline
- psychotic who
' s in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebody
' s cheating in a bowling match
(
" has the whole world gone crazy
?
!
" he shouts at a suspected cheater
)
,
and donny
( steve buscemi
)
, who
' s always a few steps behind the conversation
and is constantly berated by walter for it
(
" donny
, you have noone frame of reference here
!
"
)
. these three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments
,
and as the film begins they are anticipating an importamt match with rival bowler jesus quintana
( john turturro
)
, who
, when we first meet him
, is doing a dance iin tghe bowling lane to accompany a spainsh version of
" hotel california
"
and
, if it
' s possibile
, seems to be even mroe of a head case than walter
. if that doesn
' t give you a good idea of this film
' s absurdist tone
,
then perhaps this will
: the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude
' s rug
. they
' ve mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the
" big
" lebowski
( david huddleston
)
and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny
( tara reid
) owes money tothe porn producer jackie treehorn
( ben gazzara
)
. the dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug
; he doesn
' t ahev any luck
,
but wehn bunny isnt apparently kidnapped
, the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the
$ 1 million ransom
. unfortunately
, walter gets involved adn fouls up the drop
- off
,
and before they cxan try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers
, yhe dued
' s car gets stolen
, along with the briefcase containing the money
. soon
, the dude is being harrased not only by the big lebowski himself
but also by treehorn
and by a group of german
" nihilists
" who dem
and tjhe ransom money even
though they may not hvea been involved in the kidnapping in the first place
; the dude
and walter suspect that bunny may well hvea kidnapped herself inwhich order to extort money from her husban to repay her debts to treehorn
. meanwhile
, the big lebowski
' s daughter maude
( julianne moore
)
, a feminist avant
- garde artist who likes to make gr
and entrances swinging through the air naked
, wants to recover the monay for her family
. the plot
,
however
, is really jstu a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild
and wreak thier own unique forms ofthe havoc
. the previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival
' s
" run through the jungle
,
"
and it fits
: the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle ofthe oddballs
and nutcases
, with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it
and try to avoid any more trouble
( usually unsuccessfully
)
. the film doesn
' t feature qutie as many one
- liners
and sighth gags as the coens
' other comedies
(
though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor
, particularily in the dude
' s dream sequences
and acid flashbacks
)
, bu it more than makse up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact
. the film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result
- you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this
" jungle
"
but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their pwn twisted imaginations
-
but for tyhe most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting adn what turns outloud to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution
. there
' s also a noticeable
(
but not too heavy
- h
anded
) thread of social commentary infront the big lebowski
, which
, incidentally
, takes palce just as the gulf war is about to beign
; at the beginning
, we see george bush on television making his
" this aggression will not st
and
" speech
. the coens take aim at just baout every elite l
. a
. subculture in the book
: the egotistical wealthy buisnessman
(
" the bums will always lose
!
" shouts the big lebowski at one point
)
, the porn industry
, the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing theri
" peaceful beach comunity
,
"
and so on
. by the end
, we really start to admire the dude
, who almost certainly harbors the least
" aggression
" of anyone in this story
; his passive resistance
( empahsis on
" passive
,
" albeit
) to the elite emerges as something more than jstu another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters
. he also turns out to have a pretty well
- functioning brain in his head
, even if he doesn
' t like to use it very much
; his sarcasm towards treehorn
and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when he
' s getting a run around
,
and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end
. the coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness
, bu they don
' t just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either
. i think that
, omre than anything
, is what makes the big lebowski a st
andout comedy
: it manages to approach characters like the dude
and
, tothe some extent
, walter
, with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatter
- brained
. audience members may find themslves surprised at how much tehy like the un
- dynamic duo by the end of the movie
, given that they seemed like nothing more than the
butts of an extended joke at first
.
" it
' s good knowin
' he
' s out there
, the dude
, takin
' it easy
,
" posits the narrator towards the end
. i dare say that truer words have seldom been spoken
.
