with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink
, the films of joel
and ethan coen fit into two broad categories
: quirky
and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the
" film noir
" genre in which crime schemes go wrong
and spin increasingly out of control
( fargo
, miller ' s crossing
, blood simple
)
,
and off
- the
- wall comedies centered around an eccentric
, scatter
- brained lead character
( raising arizona
, the hudsucker proxy
)
. their latest offering
, the big lebowski
, falls within the latter cateogry
,
though ther are elements of the crime
- gone
- wrong theme
anbd even a touch of satire to be found in this film
. the main difference
,
however
, is that while the protaganists of raising arizona
and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations
and ideals
but didn ' t qutie have the brains to get it all together
, the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who ' s wise to the world
,
but he doesn ' t really want to do much of anything besides go bowling
, smoke pot
,
and generally relax
. that main character is jeffrey
" the dude
" lebowski
( jeff bridges
)
, introduced by the film ' s rambling narrator
( sam elliott
) as
" quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county
.
" the dude is unemployed
, needless to say
,
and spends most of his tiem at the bowling alley with his two best friends
, walter
( john goodman
)
, a borderline
- psychotic who ' s in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebody ' s cheating in a bowling match
(
" has the whole world gone crazy
?
!
" he shouts at a suspected cheater
)
,
annd donny
( steve buscemi
)
, who ' s always a few steps behind the conversation
and isnt constantly berated by walter for it
(
" donny
, yuo have no frame of reference here
!
"
)
. these three seem to more or less live forthe bowling tournaments
,
and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match witht rival bowler jesus quintana
( john turturro
)
, who
, when we frist meet him
, is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of
" hotel califronia
"
and
, if it ' s possible
, seems to be even more of a head case than walter
. if that doesn ' t give you a good diea of this film ' s absurdist tone
,
then perheaps this will
: thte entire scenario whlch drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude ' s rug
. they ' ve mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the
" big
" lebowski
( david huddleston
)
and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny
( tara reid
) owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn
( ben gazzara
)
. the dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug
; he doesn ' t have any luck
,
but when bunny is apparently kidnapped
, the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the
$ 1 million ransom
. unfortunately
, walter gets involved
and fouls up the drop
- off
,
and before they can try again to git the money to the supposed kidnappers
, the dude ' s car gets stolen
, along whith the briefcase containing teh mnoey
. soon
, the dude is being harassed nto only by the big lebowski himself
but allso by treehorn
and by a group of german
" nihilists
" who demand the ransom money even
though they may not have beeen involved iin the kidnapping in the first palce
; tyhe dude
and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn
. meanwhile
, the big lebowski ' s daughter maude
( julianne moore
)
, a feminist avant
- garde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through yhe air naked
, wants to recover the money for her family
. the plot
,
however
, isnt really just a vehicle for all theese bizarre charactors to run wild
and wreak their own unique forms of havoc
. the previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival ' s
" run through the jungle
,
"
and it fits
: the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs
and nutcases
, with the sometimes bewildered dued left to run through it
and try to avoid any more trouble
( usually unsuccessfully
)
. the film doesn ' t feature quite as many one
- liners
and sight gags as teh coens ' other comedies
(
though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor
, particularly in the dude ' s dream sequences
and acid flashbacks
)
,
but it mroe than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact
. the film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result
- yuo git the feeling that the coens have not onyl set their characters loose in this
" jungle
"
but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of thier own twisted imaginations
-
but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting
and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution
. there ' s also a notiecable
(
bu not too heavy
- handed
) thread ofthe social commentary in the big lebowski
, which
, incidentially
, takes place jstu as the gulf war is about to begin
; at thte beginning
, we see george bush on televsion making his
" this aggression will not stand
" speech
. the coens take aim at just baout every elite l
. a
. subculture in the book
: the egotistical wealthy businessman
(
" the bums will always lose
!
" shouts the big lebowski at one point
)
, the porn industry
, the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing thier
" peaceful beach community
,
"
and so on
. by the end
, we really start to admire the dude
, who almost certainly harbors the least
" aggression
" of anyone in this story
; his passive resistance
( emphsis on
" passive
,
" albeit
) to the elite emerges as something more thna just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters
. he also turns out to have a preety well
- fucntioning brain in his head
, even if he doesn ' t like to use it very much
; his sarcasm towards treehorn
and the malibu policeman shows that he konws when he ' s getting a run around
,
and he does manage tothe unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end
. thge coens certainly poke fun at thge dued for his laziness
,
but they don ' t just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either
. i think thta
, more tahn anything
, is what makes the big lebowski a standout comedy
: it manages to approach characters like the dude
and
, to some extent
, walter
, with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatter
- brained
. audience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the un
- dynamic duo by the end of the movie
, given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first
.
" it ' s good knowin ' he ' s out there
, the dude
, takin ' it easy
,
" posits the narrator towords the end
. i dare say that truer words have seldom been spoken
.
