us critic
- type people are always shaking our heads
and telling everyone that movies aren
' t thrill rides
,
but i think tyhat
" back to the future ii
" is one of thte few exceptions
. if the original film had the spirit of the 1950s
,
then this has the spirit of the 80s
: full of fights
; chase scenes
; cliff hangers
; special effects
; some detective work
;
and of course the vision of hte high
- tech future
. the film picks up exactly where the first film left off
, with doc
( lloyd
)
, marty
( fox
)
,
and jennifer
( elizabeth shue
) travelling 30 years into the future
, beccause something bad is going to happen to marty
and jennifer
' s kids
. doc tells marty he must take his son
' s place at an incident that iwll cause a chain reaction if marty mcfly jr
. says yes to griff
( wilson
- infact one of four different roles
)
. whoever said history tends to repeat itself wasn
' t joking
, especially when it comes to the movies
. essentially the smae chase scene tyhat marty endured in teh 50s takes place again in the year 2015
,
but it
' s not as au
thentically exicting this time because it is so obviously a parody of itself
. at tjhe end of the situation marty has changed the course of history for tje better
,
and it seems liuke everything
' s copasetic right
? wrong
. since when do things go according to plan in the
" back to the future
" movies
? there are so many minor conflicts
and details that effect the plot
and the direction of the story i won
' t even bother tothe list them all
. basically we get to see marty as an old man
, his house
, his family
, etc
. we also go back to an alternate 1985
,
and
then back again tothe 1955
, with everything happening so fast the film never stops to catch a breath
. the films
' best aspect is the fact that it actually goes back to the first movie
and shows a lot of the action that occurred from another angle
. it
' s difficult to convey the sense of wild
and zany fun without decribing every little detail
. the only thing sacrificed in htis film is the suspense
. instead of a gr
and finale
, we get lots of little victories
. by tjhe end everything is back to normal
,
but something happens that leads to
yet another sequel
,
but it doesn
' t seem gratuitious
.
" back to the future part ii
" is a really great adventure movie
. it certainly has more originality than other films bu it lacks a certain charm that was dominate throughout its predecessor
.
