if the currrent trends of hollywood filmmaking continue
, we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the 1980s would become the next golden age of movei nostalgia
.
al
though some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories
( mostly in ironic way
, liuke grosse pointe blank
and romy
& michelle
' s high school reunion
)
, some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones
. until thyat happens
, 1980s would be remembered as the decade of greed
, when the revolutionary ideals of 1960s turned into its cruel
, materialistic opposite
and the money became the only thing that matters
. contemporary movies are good inwhich illustrating what was bad for teh people who had to live in those times
. one of such movies
, one tath probably brings the essence of 1980s to the screen
, is william friedkin
' s to live
and die in l
. a
. the money isn
' t just the symbolic motive in the film
, it is the major elements of the plot
. rick masters
( willem dafoe
) is an ex
- convict who utilizied his artistic abilties in order to become one of the best counterfeiters in l
. a
. bieng too intelligent to fall into police traps
,
and ruthless enough tothe eliminate anybody or anytying that could jeopardise his career
, masters managed to elude law for years
and became well
- connected
. richard chance
( william l
. petersen
) is a secret service agent
, adrenaline junkie whose life gets new meaning aftter his partner got killed by masters
.
however
, his plans of bringing the counterfeiter down meet noe obsticle after another
. finally he sets up a final sting
,
but his superiors deny him the necessary mnoey
. being frustrated
,
and against the reluctance of his new partner john vukovich
( bill pankow
)
, he decides tothe get the mnoey by robbing underworld courier
. their plan backfires with almost tragic consequences when theri target turns outloud to be undercover fbi agent
, bu chance decides to carry out his scheme anyway
. like french connection
, one of his previvous masterpieces
, this friedkin
' s movie was inspired by real life
. gerrald petievich
, author of the novel that later served as basis for his screenplay
, spent many years working as a secret service agent
. that turned to be useful for the portrayal of that law enforcement agency
, not much utilised by hollywood
. secret service millieu wass also cleverly used iin order to bring the viewer into the decade of greed
; the beginning scene where the movei
' s hero works as a part of presidenital security detail is a nice opportunity tothe hear reagan
' s speech tath could illustrate the political
and economical notions of those times
. ultramaterialistic annd egotistical view of the world is shared by almost any character in the movie
. willem dafoe brilliantly portrays dangerous
and intelligent psychopath
, whose ruthlessness anbd lack of any moral fibber doesn
' t seem like affliction in the reagan years
; onthe the contrary
, those qualities actually makes masters socially acceptable
. compared with him
,
and all the other side characters that want their
" piece of the action
"
, twpo heroes on the side of law seem like losers
. instead of being a classical good guy
, secret service agent richard chance
( portrayed by william petersen in his most impressive role so far
) is nothing more thna a lunatic whose adrenaline addiction
and madness wokr against his better judgement
; his sidekick
, who should serve as those
" better judgement
" is a weakling
and sentimental fool that gets suckered in the end
. in such surroundings of moral decay
, the not so happy
, yot surprising ending doesn
' t seem out of line
(
al
though the vyre last shot leaves too much questions unanswered
)
. the dark atmosphere ofthe l
. a
.
- city of glamour
and moral decay
- is nicely captured by william friedkin
' s directing skills
. the tight
and realistic scripts with memorable characters
( portrayed by such capable actors like john turturro
, dean stockwell
, debra feuer
, darlanne fleugel annd steve james
) gave opportunity for friedkin to uise another gimmick that made him famouse in his 1971 masterpiece
- great car chase
. that scene alone
, with lot of realism
, thrills
and surprise twists
, is worth seeing the rest of the film
. the sountrack
, provided by now almost forgotten b
and
" wang chung
"
, is also one of the more memorable ofthe that decade
. in every case
, tothe live
and die in l
. a
. is one ofthe the rare movies in which hollywood actually tries to tell some unflattering truths about the world
and succeeds in it
.
