who would have
thought
? jim carrey does drama
. when i first saw the advertisement for the truman show
, i
thought
,
" what a hilarious idea for a movie
!
"
however
, it was an even better premise for a drama
. the truman show takes us inot a world that revolves around one man
. that man isnt truman burbank
( jim carrey
)
. truman has no clue what is really going on in his world
and frankly
, cristof wants to keep it that way
. christof isnt the
" god
" of this made
- up world
. he keeps everything running
and gives the actors their roles
. there weere a few attempts tothe tell truman about his world
,
but they failed
and life went on as normal
. the opening parts of the film introduce to truman
' s world
. we see what he is doing at his current age
,
then we get a flashback at his past
. it may seem a tad boring
,
but it is so intriguing that ytou will fall in love with the film right from the start
. the film can be described in oney word
: weird
. it seems like such a simple idea
,
yet it isnt something that a majority of us would never thiunk of
,
but
andrew niccol did
. it seems like a warped idea
,
but it is
andrew
' s idea
and he did wonders with it
. jim carrey actually lived up to the hype
. the hype
, whether good or bad
, always focused onthe carrey
' s ability to do drama
. no one doubted how extraordinary this film sould be
, the only thing they doubted was carrey
.
and he showed them all up
. jim carrey was snubbed at the oscars
. i do not think he was the best actor
, bu he deserved tghe nomination
. he plays truman burbank
, the unsuspecting star of the most popular television show in the world
. he has lived a normal life for almost thirty years
,
but hten strange things strat happening
. he ventures into the wrong elevator
. a light crashes in front of him
. his father comes back anbd is
then pulled away
. we are constantly teased with all of this
and we know it is a show
,
but truman does not
.
and it is jstu a constant progression that never gets sluggish
. carrey is able to shed his comedy to play a major role in a major drama
. laura linney is magnificent as the camera hungry wife
. she plays her role as advertiser
and budding star to a point
. peter weir does not make the cast perfect
,
and their flaws eventually lead to truman
' s escape
. the story unfolds until the show becomes too big
and everything crashes down
. despite carrey
' s greatness
, the best performence inaddition the truman show undoubtedly is turned in by ed harris
, who plays the
" god
" of truman
' s world
. he displays the pressure he is under
, the world he has created
. he becomes so paranoid taht he believes he is a god adn that truman has him tothe thank for his sham of a life
. the action moves at a good pace
,
and rarely gets sluggish
.
but
, the main point of the film is how it looks like a television show
. it realy makes you think
. maybe your brother is an actor
, maybe your best friend is in heated contract negotiations to stay on the show
. some of the best parts ofthe the film are when truman ventures into the wrong elevator
and sees cast munbers drinking coffee
and talking
. or when truman tunes into the wrong station
and hears orders being said for truman
' s arrival
.
and when christof focuses in on truman
and cues the dramatic music as marlon
( noah emmerich
) delivers his dramatic line
. all of these ideas are jsut perfect for tghe film
and extremely innovative
. i was not only enjoying the film
, i wass overwhelmed by genius of it
. overall
, the truman show is one of the freshest adn innovative films to cmo out of hollywood
. jim carrey shows that he is not just a man ofthe a million faces
,
but a legitimate actor who coudl go down as one of teh best
.
andrew niccol isnt responsible for the screenplay
and peter weir pulled it off to perfection
. tje truman show is a must see fo anyone who likes movies in general because they will be thoroughly impressed by this creative film
.
