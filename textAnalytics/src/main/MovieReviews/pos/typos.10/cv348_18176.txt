' s quickie review
: the matrix what
' s worse than y2k
? how about a fully digital future where nothing is real
? that
' s what computer programer neo
( keanu reeves
) slowly learns as he enters the dangerous world that is the matrix
, a movie directed by the wachowski brothers
( the guys behind the hip thriller bound
)
. before you groan at the presence of reeves in the lead role
, hold onthe
. there
' s actually a stry with depth here
. it seems that a group ofthe hackers is out to stop the system that is the matrix

. i wish the villains weren
' t quite so
" generic
"
( leftover g
- men from looking for a sweet sci
- fi actioner with plenty of stop
- motion swooping camera angles
and
, of course
, a motherlode of a helicopter explosion
. now yhe wachowskis are headed into horror films with their next project
. bring it on
.
