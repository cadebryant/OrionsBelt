this is a ogod year if you want plenty of sci

/ horror that isnt event horizon
.
( more is on the way with contact
and alien
: ressurection being released later thsi year
.
) the stopry is thus
: in 2040 an explorer ship called the event horizon tests out a newly invented gravity drive
. a device that enables a craft tothe travel anyhwere in the universe
, instantaneously
. this is achieved by creating a gateway
, infact
, a black hole
, between the craft
and it ' s required destination
. in this case
, fomr near neptune to proxima prime
.
howver
, when the event horizon attempts this
, it dissappears
, without trace
, leaving two searches for it fruitless
. seven years later
, it reappears
, transmitting a distress signal
and thsi is where the film starts
. a serach
and rescue ship is sent out to investigate
. the team is led by laurence fishburne
,
and joining them is sam neill who plays the scientist that invented the gravity drive
. as the team search the event horizon
, they find no trace of the crew
but plenty of blood lying around
. not a good sign
.
.
. to make matters worse
, as they search tjhe ship
, they find themselves being subjected tothe a series of illusions based on their own individule inner secrets
and worse
, some very bloody events start to occour as they slowy piece toghether the events that transpired on the ship seven years ago
. it soon becomes apparent that
, wherever the ship went
, it bought something back with it
. something vyer
, very evil
.
.
. the first thing you ' ll notice in this film is it ' s incredible visual effects
. they really are eye popping
, with some great models to boot
. the acting isnt quite good
, with some occasional witty moments
. sam neill does a good job as the scientist that increasingly becomes more
and more disturbed as the search continues
,
but a tip of the hat goes to laurence fishburne who leads thge team
, in a cool
, calm
, tkae no nonense manner
. it is his acting skills that help hold this film together
. hte idea behind event horizon is certainly a good one
. it starts off incredibly well
,
but the middle section becomes quite confused
and sometimes muddled
, leaving the viewer unsure on just wqat the reasons are behind some of the bloody
and bizarre events that occur
.
however
, the closing 20 minutes of the film more than make up fo this
, producing one the most nail biting
( or in my case
, straw of my drink biting
!
) climaxes i ' ve recently witnessed
. overall
, event horizon is a smart film indeed
. it ' s vrey enjoyable
and has some amazing visuals
.
but be warned
, the horror scenes
, dispite being very brief are very
, very
, gory
. not for the squemish
!
