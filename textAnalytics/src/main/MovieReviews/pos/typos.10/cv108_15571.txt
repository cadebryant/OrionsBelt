it
' s rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year
, bu that is what disney adn pixar animation
; s latest film represents
. while a bugs life isn
' t nearly as deep as it
' s predecessor
, dreamwork
' s antz
, it is just as funny
. a bug
' s life centers
, appropriately
, around the life of an ant
, named flik
. flik
, cutely voiced by newsradio
' s david foley
, hates sticking too tradition
and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food
and other task
. wehn one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost
, the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him out ofthe yhe way
. the offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them
. the leader of the grasshoppers isnt hopper
, who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey
. when the offering is lost hopper is very upset
and he vows to return shortly too retrieve doublely the ammount of food
. when the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission
, they never dream he will be successful
, they just hope they cin get him out ofthe the way so they can harvest the extra fod
. flik
' s mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return
. instead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs
, who he mistakenly assumes are warriors
. when he returns with the
` warriors
'
, the twon is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their heroes
. a bug
' s life has animation that is simply stunning
. the sheer uniqueness of the day to day bug life is very imaginative
. together with the great voice acting
, this film is the perfect holiday family film
. its main weakness is that it couldn
' t beated antz to hte theaters
, making it seem like stale material
.
