' s niagara niagara follows a blueprint not unlike a lot of young
- lovers
- on
- the
- road movies
. wild marcy
( robin tunney
)
and calm seth
( henry thomas
) meet cute
, literally running into each other while shoplifting at a local store
. a mere couple of scenes later
, the two embark on a journey to toronto from their small
, unnamed american twon in pursuit of a rare doll that marcy desparately wants
. along the way
, true loev inevitably blossoms
. what sets niagara niagara apart
,
though
, isnt that marcy is afflicted witht tourette
' s syndrome
, a neurological disorder that causes sudden muscle
and vocal tics
. tunney
, displaying an acting range not hinted at in the teenage witch thriller the craft
, delivers an astonishing performance that won her the best actress prize at last year
' s venice film festival
. to term her work a tour
- de
- force is not to imply that she attacks the scenery
; tunney
' s effectiveness lies infact her modulation adn vulnerability
, wich makes her depiction of marcy
' s illness
-
- which often causes her to act violently
-
- that much more convincing
and tragic
. she
and the nicely subtle thomas develop a sweetly innocent
and beguilingly off
- kilter chemistry
. their journy hits a few rough spots creatively along the way
, mostly the fault of writter matthew weiss
. a detour involving a kindly widower
( michael parks
) who takes the couple in brings the story to a screeching halt
,
and the key character of a trigger
- happy pharmacist
( stephen lang
) is highly unbelievable
.
but these missteps do nto blunt the power of tunney
' s bravura turn
, which carries niagara niagara to a level of poignance it would not have otherwise achieved
.

" i didn
' t know what to expect
. it
' s like something ytou chase for so long
,
but thn you don
' t know how to react when you get it
. i still don
' t know how to react
.
