( r
) bob gosse ' s niagara niagara follows a blueprint not unlike a lot of young
- lovers
- on
- the
- road movies
. wild marcy
( robin tunney
)
and calm seth
( henry thomas
) meet cute
, literally runing into earch other while shoplifting at a local store
. a mere couple of scenes later
, the twpo embark on a journey to toronto from their small
, unnamed american town in pursuit of a rare doll that marcy desperately wants
. along the way
, true loev inevitably blossoms
. what sets niagara niagara apart
,
though
, is that marcy is afflicted wiht tourette ' s syndrome
, a neurological disorder that causes sudden muscle
and vocal tics
. tunney
, displaying an acting range not hinted at in the teenage witch thriller the craft
, delivers an astonishing performance that won her the best actress prize at last year ' s venice film festival
. tothe term her work a tour
- de
- force is not to imply that she attacks the scenery
; tunney ' s effectiveness lies in her modulation
anbd vulnerability
, which makes her depiction of marcy ' s illess
-
- which often causes her to act violently
-
- that much more convincing
and tragic
. she
and the nicely subtle thomas develop a sweetly innocent
and beguilingly off
- kilter chemistry
. their journey hits a fewd rough spots creatively along the way
, mostly the fault of writer matthew weiss
. a detour involving a kindly widower
( michael parks
) who takes the couple in brings the stroy to a screeching halt
,
annd the key character of a trigger
- hapyp pharmacist
( stephen lang
) is highly unbeleivable
.
but these missteps do not blunt the power of tunney ' s bravura turn
, which carries niagara niagara to a level of poignance it would not have otherwise achieved
.

" i didn ' t know what to expect
. it ' s like something you chase fo so long
,
but
then you don ' t know how to react when you get it
. i still don ' t know how to react
