one of the best movies i
' ve ever seen
. i
' d herad extremely good things about this movie
,
and
though the previews didn
' t really intrigue that much
, it was a movie i
' d beeen anticipating for a few months now
. for some reason i
' m not sure of
- this movie was not tyhat big a sucess over in the u
. s
. it was a definite hit with the critics
,
but didn
' t exactly set any box office records
. after viewing this incredibly well directed
, written adn acted movie
, i can
' t help
but wonder
- why
? the strength of this film is it
' s gritty realism
. the main characters are all human with individual flaws
, noone stereo
- type hollywood heroes
. you may not agree with many of their actions infact the movie or their approach to life
,
but that is what makes it so real
. i had expected this movie to be more ofthe a drama than a thriller
,
but i was mistaken
. even the interrogation scenes moved at such a pace so that it felt just as thrilling as any car chase
.
and the ending
.
.
.
.
.
. whoa
. i
' ve never seen a movie in my life where everyone in it acts brilliantly
. the three male leads
- guy pearce
, kevin spacey
and russell crowe are all just terrific
. the
' best actor
' oscar talk surrounding this film should hvae netted one of them a statue
,
but there is one problem there
. how could they have chosen between theese three actors
? there is no way i could look at this film
and say one of them was better than the other twpo
. it
' s impossible
. kim bassinger
' s performence is also a revelation
. i
' d never been a big fan of hers before
and always throught she was
, well
.
.
. what
' s the word
- a twinky
? tht impression has changed
, as she complemented crowe
and pearce perfectly
. the depth to thge stroy
and characters is truly astounding
. no cardboard characters here
. the plot is full of twists
and turns
and some very clever sequences
. pearce
' s interogation ofthe three seperate suspects is nothing short of brilliant
. i really can
' t fault this movie at all
. i was so glad to see fellow australian
' s pearce
and crowe star in such a breathtaking movie
. i had been very familiar with russell crowe beforeh
and from his many austrailian films
,
but had not seen much of guy pearce
. i intend to change htis next time i visit the video store
