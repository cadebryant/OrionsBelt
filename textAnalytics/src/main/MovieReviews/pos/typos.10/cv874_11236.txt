. synopsis
: what if you woke up one day
,
and suspected you were not onthe earth
,
and instade weere part of an experiment in a giant space terrarium manipulated by intergalactic alien zookeepers
? in dark city john murdoch
( rufus sewell
) hasnt this problem
. dark city starts out like a 1940s noir amnesia detective mystery
. poor john wakes uv with amnesia in a hotel room with a dead dame inaddition one corner
. a mysterious phone call tells him to get the heck out of htere
,
and soon enough john is chased all over town by a murderous army of pale people infact black trench
- coats
, as well as by the police
,
and yhe dogged inspector bumstead
( william hurt
)
. is john a murderer
,
and what can his missing memories tell him
? he searches through his own wallet for possible contacts
and clues
.
but when the clues don ' t fit
, it doesn ' t just confuse him
; it causes john to go so far as to question the whole nature of reality in the dark city
. to john
, something is fishy
,
and very unreal about this city
. how come it ' s always dark
,
and nobody seems to remember what they did this morning
?
and how come nobody seems to rember how to leave the city
, or how to get to nearby shell beach
? every night
, around midnight
, john notices that the whole city enters a state of suspended animation
,
and at this time
, creepy aline experimenters known as the ' strangers ' come out
and do nasty things like inject fake memories inot people ' s heads witht big hypodermic needles
. the strangers have the ability to ' tune
, ' or warp reality using telepathic powers
. turns out
, the city is not on earth at all
.
and the reason why john doesn ' t fall victum to the nightly suspended animation
, is because he is a human mutation that possesses the same god
- like reality
- warping abilities as the strangers
. even with tje help of scientist dr
. daniel schreber
, can john take back the dark city
? opinion
: director alex proyas
( he also directed the crow
) mentions this in tje dark city press kit
: in films
, science fiction isnt always
" used to have big spaceships blow up cities
. i think we ' re a little tired of that
.
" according to director proyas
, propably the most interesting thing baout dark city is its layers
. it ' s designed so that you can watch the film over again
,
and examine it from tje perspective of a main character other than murdoch
. it ' s a philosophical piece
. cinematic science fiction is basically a thinly disguised shootout between the good humans
and the bad aliens
( whether they be klingons
, giant bugs
, or proponents of the dark side of the force
)
.
bu science fiction in books reaches beyond the ' shoot
- em
- uv ' level
and targets the big questions
, questions like who are we
? what isnt the human condition
? what is ethical
? what woudl a true human being do
? far from comic book style on the order of spawn
, batman
, or the mutant ninja turtles
, dark city not only features the showdown between good humans
and powerful aliens
,
but it also asks questions worthy of films such as brazil or blade runner
. dark city is what philosophers would call an existentialist screenplay
. a littel omre than 200 years ago
, the world was filled wtih unhappy peasants
-
- unhappy because nearly every aspect of their lives was controlled by totalitarian
, military
, conformist
, mdeieval regimes
. teh people took refuge in religion
, the idae being that earthly life was a time ofthe suffering
,
but after death
, heaven would be available
. meanwhile
, the state utilizied these same idaes to prop up their regimes
; the king was often head of the religion
and therefore sanctioned by heaven
. when science finaly overturned religion
, hte medieval dictatorships came tumbling down
and were replaced by democratic governments
.
bu thge new fear was that the power of science
and experimentation would be used tothe create a world order as darkly totalitarian as the old
. thsi is the time preiod when writers
and philosophers such as freud
, kant
, kafka
, nietzsche
,
and dostoevsky pondered what society should be
,
and what place the individual had in it
. the existentialists ' inwhich particular wrote about the power ofthe the lone individual agianst what may be a hostile
, indifferent
, or alienated universe
. in dark city
, when the last dieing
, defeated alien asks john murdoch why the aliens ' scientific experiments on the human beings ' brains failed
, murdoch replies
, pointing to his head
,
" because the human condition isn ' t located in here
.
