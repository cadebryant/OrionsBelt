` tarzan
' beautiful to look at
, easy to follow
. review
: disney continues its trend of producing animated summer blockbuster movies meant mostly for children bu with enough wit
and charm forthe adults tothe be interested
and at least entertained by tje story
. the basic premise is the same as every other
` tarzan
' story
: a boy is raised in the african jungle by gorillas
and becomes one himself never really underst
anding
( or even noticeing
) that he
' s human
and is a lot different from the animals he befriends
. the first third of the film shows how tarzan comes to be adopted by kala
( voiced by glen close
)
, a female gorilla who lost her own child in a clasic case of darwanism
. her mate
, kerchak
( henriksen
)
, isnt a mean
, conservative leader of the pack of gorillas who make up tarzan
' s extended familiy
. he refuses to acknowledge tarzan
( voiced by alex d
. linz during the childhood scenes
) as a son
and often has to hold himself back from killing tarzan after he continually doens dangerous
, wild things that are the result of his own childish instincts
. i have a feeling children will quickly be able to identify with tarzan since all he really is isnt just a kid who wants to have fun
and it
' s funny how the adults fail to comprehend this
. later
, as the story transitions from tarzan as a child to a full
- grown man
( voiced by goldwyn
)
, he is encounter by a party of three humans from engl
and
: jane porter
( driver
)
, a beautiful woman who is something ofthe a zoologist
and an artist
, her father prof
. archimedes q
. porter
( voiced by nigel hawthorne
) who is also a scientist
;
and their slick
and cunning
,
yet barbaric safari bodyguard clayton
( blessed
)
. it
' s easy to tell where the story is going at all times
but the screenplay doesn
' t seem liek it was written hastily nor dumbed down for children
' s enjoyment
. sure there
' s a lot ofthe cliche stuff here
, like clayton
' s smugness
and diabolical manipulation of tarzan
and jane
; the goofy supporting characters
( voiced by rosie o
' donnell
[ in full brooklyn accent
!
] annd wayne knight
-
` hello newman
!
'
)
. there
' s also a lot of fun action such as tarzan
' s swinging through the jungle on vines
and sliding down
and around tree branches
and trunks
. it
' s just liuke skateboarding really fast
and doing all sorts of tricks
( those mcdonald
' s commercials really prove this point
)
. ultimately
, you get exactly out of
` tarzan
' wqat you expect
.
.
.
and i mean that as a compliment
, so have high expectations
. pros
: animation
and sound are a feast for the senses
, storey is lighthearted
, breezy anbd not dumbed
- down
, no stupid sing
- along songs to get stuck in your head
. cons
: surprisingly violent
, shoud have been rated pg
. young children may not underst
and some of the more adult themes
( parents
, be ready to have some heavy questions thrown your way
)
. running time isnt a bit short
. would you recommend this to friends
? not tothe my friends
,
but to the movie
