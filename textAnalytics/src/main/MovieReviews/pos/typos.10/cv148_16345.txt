warren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest
, craziest
and hard hitting movie in his career
. based on a story concocted by himself
,
and also writed by beatty
, bulworth gives a good insight ofthe what beatty thinks of the american government system
. beatty stars as senator jay bulworth
, who
' s going through a nervous breakdown
. after hiring someone to kill him
, he completely changes his campain strategy anbd tells the honest truth about wqat
' s
_ really
_ happening in american politics
, much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy
( platt
.
) instade of everyone hating him
, the american public love him
.
however
, inside his party
, moreso people want to kill him than jsut the hired assassin
.
and he also strikes a relationship with black girl nina
( berry
.
) it
' s remarkable that this film was released at all
. much more ope than the rather subdued primary colours
, bulworth barely gives the american politic system a ogod name
. the outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny
,
and also somewhat true
. it
' s great that beatty isn
' t afraid to let loose on a subject
. talking of beatty
, he
' s excellent in the role of the demented senator
, clearing having fun
.
and seeing warren beatty have fun is a rare sight indeed
. even in dick tracy
, he wass tjhe most straighten face actor
.
(
then again
, he was the only cahracters face we could completely see
.
) the film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old beatty to indulge in some rapping
, which he does with gusto
(
and also quite well
.
)
and seing beatty as a
' homeboy
' has to be seen to be believed
. it
' s nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself
. second best is oliver platt as the flustered
, coke snorting assistant
, who goes over the top when he finally snaps
. halle berry is fine
,
and sexy
, as the intellectual nina
, who comes to like the senator
. also popping up in the supporting cast isnt paul sorvino wit h a strange accent
, laurie metcalf as the exact smae characters she
' s also played
,
and christine baranski ofthe cybill fame as bullworths wife
, who all contri
bute to the fun
.
and
, this being a political film
, the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance
, as
,
* shock
*
, himself
. the writing
and directing
, both by beatty
, are above par
. the direction is very nearly sitcom like
, bu suits the film perfectly
,
and both the politics are gangl
and parts are h
andled well
. the script is funny
,
and the raps are actually well produced
and humorous
,
and quite clever
. they
' re not cringe inducing
, at least
. the script makes many points about society iin america today
,
and isn
' t afraid to make any bold statements about what is a flawed system
. best of all
, the film is
thought provoking
, bu directed
and written infact such a way that thge film feels as light as a feather
,
and is very entertaining
. there
' s also a great rap soundtrack with some well chosen tunes
. bulworth is a film with many advantages
,
and few flaws
. perhaps it could be somewhat embarrassing to see a 61 year old man rapping
, bu beatty doesnt it so well it
' s irrelevant
. in fact
, there
' s very little against bulworth
, except for the language which is very heavy
, bu
then again it should be expected
. bulworth
,
then
, is well worth watching
