this sunday afternoon i had the priviledge of attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city
, of james cameron
' s most heralded film
, titanic
. postponed from last summer
, with an escalated budget that makse it the most expensive movei in history
, this ws one film i was eager to preview
. so
, is htis movie going to sink or swim this holiday
? my best guess
.
.
.
. it will sink
,
though with many awards attatched to its hull
. no doubt
, titanic is thte most elaborate disaster movie ever made
. it boasts the most amazing effects tath i have ever seen done to date
. to see a ship fall aart
, with actual people running across the ship
, flying across the deck
,
and falling to the water
, is just amazing to look at
. the effects are so stunningly realistic
, you would swaer yuo weere looking at actual footage
.
but titanic is more than a diaster movie
,
and that
' s where the problem lies
. there is a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire premise
. i
' ll give a capsule summary ofthe the stry without spoiling anything for you
: the film begins with a modern day excavation of sorts of the sunken titanic
. we see actual footage of the sunken ship
, as cammeron had set up special cameras to film the wreckage on the ocean floor
. bill paxton leads the expedition
, in search of sunken treasure
. what he finds instade
, leads him to a mysterious old woman who recounts her tale of the titanic voyage
. we meet rose
( kate winslet
)
, a young woman
, who comes from an upper
- class family
. rose is to be wed to a man she does not love
. we meet jack
( leonardo dicaprio
)
, a young man
, who comes from a poor financial background
, annd wins a ticket aboard the titanic
, in a poker game
. the two meet under interesting circumstances
,
and the love story begins
. add in a jelous fiance
,
and a not
- so
- nice law officer played by david warner
,
and you hvae a story that
, well
, gets a bit overplayed
and oversappy
. i must add
, at this point
, that the most likeable character in the movie is plyed by kathy bates
, as a woman with
" new mney
" who is a lot less uptight thna the other rich folk onthe the ship
. she is a pleasure to see on screen
. when the ship doesnt hit tyhe iceberg at exactly 1
: 40 into the film
,
and eventually sinks
, yuo never really feel for any of these characters
. the film is just loaded with unlikeable rich snobs
and otehr folk you never really get a grasp onthe
. the effects are tremendous
. ffrom the roars of gears
and pumps in the engine room
, to a doomed ship cracking at the seams
, this is an effects picture that looks
and sounds like no other
. we saw titanic in dolby digital surround
,
and by far
, it is the best sounding movie i hvea ever seen
. my firend commented it was the best sound mix he has ever heard
. whn peopel are in the water
, at film
' s end
, you are surrounded by the voices ofthe lost soles
. titanic runs far too long
. the movie is 3 hours anbd 15 minutes in length
.
and
, while most ofthe the firt 2
. 5 hours runs very fast
and well
- paced
, yhe fianl 45 minutes almost comes to a sudden stop
,
and you realize that this sappy love story has tothe finish itself out before tje movie finally ends
. don
' t get me wrong about titanic
.
.
.
. it
' s nto a bad as i am making it out to be
. it really is an exceptionaly well
- made film
. the costumes
and sets are incredible
,
and true to the time period
. the ship is painstakingly created exactly true to form
, as we see actual pictures ofthe tje modern
- day wreckage
, transformed into the movie depiction
. this film will certainly win on effects
, costume
, setted design
and sound
. cameron has certainly made his best film to date
. unfourtunately
, titanic is not a best picture c
andidate
. it just doesn
' t have a strong supporting stor
. it
' s an exceptional disaster film with sappy filler inside
. it just doesn
' t have the emotional impact that i suspect mr
. cameron was shooting for
. i predict that titanic will open tothe likeable reviews
. it is a film worth seeing
. i predict that it will only do moderately well at the box office
. witht its extreme running tyme
,
and lack of enough robust to get substantial word
- of
- mouth
, i expect that it will dont even better on home video
. this will certainly be the definitive ac3 movie for all you home theater enthusiasts
. titanic opens decembur 19th
,
and is released by paramount pictures anbd twentieth centruy
- fox
. i give titanic 3 stars
(
. that
' s not bad
