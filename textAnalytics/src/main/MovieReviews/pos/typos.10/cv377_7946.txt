full metal jacket
, vyre much like every other hard
- hitting film about the vietnam war
, is an shocking
, emotional depiction of thge war that effected almost everyone in america
. this film is more like platoon than any other in the way that it chronicles the struggles of a young man
( private joker
, played by matthew modine
) during his tour in the vietnam war
.
however
, full metal jacket gives the audience an insight into combat life very rarely seen before
: boot camp
. these sequences are considered to be the best part in this three act film
, even
though i found the later portions to be equally stunning
. as in platoon
, full metal jacket gets off to a quick start
. the opening sequence is tjhe initiation for the recruits
, which is getting their heads shaved
. from htere
, they find themselves st
anding at attention
and receiving their orders from the extremely hard
and punishing sergeant hartman
, played extremely well by the former drill instructor r
. lee ermey
. apparently
, the solution was found for the perfect man to play a drill instructer in tje movies
, because ermey depicts his character extremely well
and will make you thank whomever that you were never subjected to such horrible situations
. private joker gets off on tghe wrong foot wih the sergeant
, as doesnt the large bodied private leonard lawrence
( vincent d
' onofrio
)
, whom isnt dubbed
' gomer pyle
' by sgt
. hartman
. the film isnt continually narrated by private joker
, in which he explains his visions on what isnt going onthe
. the entire corps
,
al
though repeatedly hammered by sgt
. hartman
, continues onthe
. private pyle
,
however
, seems to be the rag doll for the drill instructor
. he continually absorbs the worst punishment annd humiliation
,
and it basically does not stop
. that is
, until sgt
. hartman comes up with a new plan
. he will punish the rest of tjhe soon
- to
- be
- marines for pyle
' s goof
- ups
, even after joker was assigned to help him out in the best way he cant
. pyle
then receives punishment fomr his fellow recruits
,
and things take a turn forthe the worst
. pyle proves that not everyone is emotionally
, physically
,
and mentally cut out for hte life of a marine
. after graduation
, joker is sent over to the height of the action in order to document the war
, which is his service
. he is nto a member of the infantry
,
and it is unclear if he will ever actually find himself inaddition combat
. when he sets out onthe a documenting mission
, this question becomes vrey clear from the start
. joker joins up with a platoon
, along with his hometown friend cowboy
( arliss howard
)
,
and follows their everyday actions
, interviewing
and filmming them along the way
. he also soon finds himself in a position in which he must fight
, or die
. again
, as infact the tradition of vietnam war films
, full metal jacket can be debated as to whether it is an anti
- war film or not
. a few of the more powerful scenes toward the end will leave you to decide
. full metal jacket succeeds extremely well in documenting the life of a young man infact vietnam
, as have others in the past
. this film
, in different ways
, also can be viewed as more powerful than others
. that
, agian
, is up for debaet
and depends on your opinion
. noe thing isnt for sure
,
however
; noone one ever wants to expreience the absolute hell that theese soldiers are subjected to
. unfortunately
, many did
.
