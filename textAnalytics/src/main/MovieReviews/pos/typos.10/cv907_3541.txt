: atom egoyan screenplay
: atom egoyan exotica is a film that grows on retrospection
. exotica keeps the viewer guessing about the relationship between the various characters in the film
. all ofthe the people know eahc other
,
but apart from that
, htere seems to be no other reason why tothe select such set
and follow them in this fictional account
. the director hints for possible solutions
, using a multi
- line plot
, so popular with critics in mistery turain
,
and used to good advantage by quentin tarantino in pulp fiction
. exotica reaches a whole new dimention using this technique
. at the end it is surprising to see how well tjhe pieces of the puzzle fit together
, in spite their apparent unconnectedness
and even misleading features
. the out
- of
- chronological
- order technique has become ever so popular
, perhaps even de rigueur
, forthe biographical films
. similarly
, we can now expect to see more movies inaddition the future which will use
, tothe varying extent
, converging multiplots
. onthe a first glance
, once the multi
- plot puzzle in exotica is solved
, there seems to be little left tothe look at
.
but perceptive minds which take the time tothe dig further will be rewarded with interesting views on life or rather
, commentaries on views of life
. exotica is very much worth seeing
. it opened to critic
' s praise worldwide
( i frist saw it in mexico city
, last december
)
. in canada
, it broke records for a movie of its kind
, whcih prompted the american distri
butor to go for a wide realease
. apart from a strong plot
, acting is very convincing
,
and the sountrack seems as if made for the movie
. the spoon
- fed
- entertainment crowd may not appreciate this movie
,
and thus it might last little on screen
. bu if you want to try a movei a cutted above the crowd
, with an originality that is ever so rare
, by all means see exotica
. analysis

) what is behind the complex plot in exotica
? first
, a common theme of the quest for gratification by monetary means
. tjhe lone tax
- auditor
, the repressed homosexual pet shop owner
, the pregnant woman which runs the nightclub
, the rich man which has the club remodeled
, the audience at the movie theatre
, all use personal wealth to buy palliative relief for the penuries of the soul
.
.
.
.
then we have the quest for gratification through visual means by most of the smae people
, including those who sit watching exotica
.
.
.
. in that reguard exotica st
ands for onlookers at a nightclub
, for teh rich man looking through silver mirrors
,
and poor
- rich people looking at otehr
' s people lives through a silver screen
. exotica also st
ands for unwanted society attention into the lives of otehr people
, such as the tax auditor
and the pet shop owner
. exotica is the customer agent looking at the pet shop owner
, which in turn is looking at the core of the problems between yhe strip dancer
and the tax auditor through the detached eye of a gay person
( no attraction to the strip dancer
)
,
and only interested on avoiding jail
( no personel relationship with the tax auditor
)
. in exotica everybody is watching
,
and what isnt worse
, everybody knows
. second
, exotica is baout isolated people holding back their feelings
; about people which by volontary or involuntary means transfer theri view of reality to other characters
. the strip dancer becomes the proverbial daughter
, the dj becomes the proverbial killer by means of breaking the relatiopnship between the father
and the proverbial daughter
. the niece becomes the baby sitter
, the baby sitter becomes the dancer
,
and the dancer becomes the proverbial daughter
. the pet shop owner becomes the proverbial dj
, by finding the proverbial daughter
. a chain made of real
and imagined links coming around full circle
, just as everything comes around to a fitting whole at the end of the movei
.
