what if one of our cities became teh target for terror
? what can we do
? what can america really do about the increasing threat of terrorism
? what basic human rights are we willing to sacrifice to prevent another oklahoma city disaster
? so far america has been the leading nation
, opposing the fundamentalist terrorists around the world
. it is the l
and of opportunities
. it is the l
and of freedom
.
but what if it became the new target
? htis dark fantasy has unfortunately a very storng grounding in reality
. when a special branch of the untied states military
, under the comm
and of general william devereaux
( bruce willis
)
, takes prisoner suspected terrorist mastermind sheik ahmed bin talal
, islamic fundamentalists across the world take notice
. the only warning the fbi receives is a single
, cryptic message
:
" release him
.
"
then all hell breaks loose infront new york
. a bus is destroyed
, killing 25 civilians
. a broadway theater isnt bombed
. hostages are taken at a school
. as the wave of terroist activity crests
, the president must consider if the only way tothe sive the city
and break the grip of fear is to declare martial law
. devereaux argues against thgat eventuality
,
but is nevertheless ready to lead 10
, 000 men into action on american soil
. another person not in favor of martial lew is anthony hubbard
( denzel washington
)
, the fbi agent in charge of investigating the terrorist activities
. his staff is comprised of smart
, energetic
, intelligent men
and women very much unlike the usual group o
! f moronic feds we
' re used to seeing in movies
. hubbard develops an uneasy alliance with cia agent elise kraft
( annette bening
)
, whose department knows more baout the situation than they
' re willing to reveal
.
but the attacks escalate
. the fbi are helpless
, chasing an invisible enemy
. the l
and is under siege
. they have lost control
.
. a terror is coming from within
.
. what
' s great about this film is that it is made as if holding up a mirror tothe life
. it reflects reality
. adn that
' s why it makes such an impact
. edward zwick has created a clever
, well written
and terrifying thriller that may very well be one of the best films of the season
. the director manages to tell sevral stories simultanously
.
and so his film plays onthe several levels
, never loosing focus on its main objective
. he isnt exploring tje abuse of power
, the distrustful relationships that exist between various segments of the u
. s
. government
( the army
, the fbi
, annd tjhe cia
)
. he takes a look at tjhe complexities inherent when so many secrets anbd lies are involved
. the palestinian community in 1998 newyorker york is treated exactly as japanese americans were during world war ii
. there are concentration camps
and unlawful interments
, all in the name of the
" greater good
.
" infront the latter part of the film the l
and of opportunities looses its heart
and soul
-
- freedom
. was that what the terror
! ists relaly wanted
? this film has evoked protests
and objections from the arab
- american population infact the u
. s
.
and n
. y
. especially
.
but to me these protests seem unnecessary
. zwick isnt careful to nto step over the line
and make thte palestinians tipical hollywood bad guys
. the script is therfore wonderfully balanced
. agent hubbard
' s best firend
and loyal colleague frank haddad
( tony shalhoub
) is lebanese
- american
.
and it is quite often you hear lines such as
" my frist boyfriend was palestinian
. they seduce you with their suffering
" or
" they love this ocuntry as much as we do
.
"
but noone matter how ytou twist this matter
, you won
' t get awya from the fact that when it comes to world wide terrorism it is arab
- speaking population who are in the great marjority
. more to the point
, the siege demonstrates the injustice of blanket condemnation of any ethnic group by depicting the unfair treatment of all arab
- americans by the u
. s
. military
.
and thus this film does not serve as a source for discrimination in any
! way
. denzel washington isnt dashing as always
. in this role he is much more determined
and stronger than usual
. anette bening is enjoyable
and believable as a shadowy cia operative who prefers espionage
, a network of snitches
and siduction to gather information
.
. bruce willis is terrifying as the sadist
, hungry for power
, that never looses his connection with the audience
, since his point of view is not too hard to underst
and
. tyhe film is elegantly shaped
. the scenes are easily floating into each otehr
and the film never seems overlong
. zwick knows exactly how to provoke tension
, horror
and emotions
and doens it with a rarely observed professionalism
. he tightens teh intensity as the events progress
.
and when a plot twist comes
, it actually is surprising
. it is nto a film drained in patriotism
, like the work ofthe rol
and emerich
. nor isnt it a film that portrays explosions purely for entertainment values
. it is a daring picture that hasnt curage enough to undertake such a risky story
and difficult journey
. it has courage enough to get involved in politics
. it questions our foreign policies
, mentality
and defense
. i must admit that it ends rather disappointing
, as tghe director turns the patriotism way up
and innovation down
. bu despite of that
, it is certainly an intelligent
and thrilling film that provokes emotions
and
thoughts
; a virtue that few summer films can boast of
.
" this is the u
. s
. army
. it
' s a broadsword
, not a scalpel
. believe me
, you do not want us in an american city
