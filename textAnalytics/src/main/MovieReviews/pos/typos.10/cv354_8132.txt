i was anxious to see this forthe a long time
. a friend of mine recommended this to me because he has a crush on neve campbell
,
adn he wanted to prove that she ' s as hot as he thinks he is
. he proved it for me all right
,
but the reasons i enjoy this film go way beyond that
. scream treads onthe familar ground
, horror movie with
, as star neve campbell puts it
,
" some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl who can ' t act who ' s always running uv the stairs when she should be running out the front door
.
" it ' s very familar
, your typical horror film
. so why
, you may ask after watching it
, does it seem so new
anbd original
? because it treats itself as if it hasn ' t been done before
,
and thus the viewer is disilusioned into believing that it is not old
, familar tired tsuff
. this raises another question
: how does it do tihs
? simple
: the characters
. they ' re not your typical stupid horror film victims who don ' t know what the hell to do when being chased by a guy in a ski mask
adn a machette
. they are horror fans
, they know how stuff happens in a horror movei
, they know what to do
and what not to do
,
and that makes it scary
,
and even funny at certain times
. you can tell this just by watching the opening scene where casey becker
( drew barrymore
) is making popcorn
, getting ready to watch a video
,
and some guy who sounds liek a killer calls her up to play a game withthe her that involves horror movie triva that
, if she gets it wrong
, will git her
and her boyfriend killed
. she knows waht to answer wehn he asks her horror film questions
, she just can ' t answer his final question
,
" what door am i at
?
"
and tht gets her killed
. that scene works because in a normal horror film
, half the things that hapen in that scene would never happen
. the plot is typical horror stuff
: sidney prescott
( an impressive neve campbell
)
, an attractive young high school student who ' s mother ws killed a year ago tommorrow
, is being stalked by a killer who ' s previously murdered oney of her classmates
( casey
, naturally
)
,
and everybody in this small
, california town is a suspect
, including sidney ' s boyfriend
, billy loomis
.
but as i said befor
, these peopel know how horror movies work
,
and that ' s what makes it so appealing
. that
annd the references to horror movies
, like wehn casey says
,
" the first
( nightmare on elm strent
) was skary
,
but the rest sucked
.
" which is obviously director wes craven
( who does a ogod job of poking fun of yhe genre that made him a legend
) patting himself on the back as he directed the first nightmare movie
and none of the others
,
and when tatum
, sidney ' s friend
, mentions the director
, wes carpenter
, which is obviously an homage by writer kevin williamson to not only craven
,
but also director john carpenter
. the cast is well chosen
, neve campbell pulls off a good heroine
(
and unlike most horror film heroines
, she
* can
* act
)
, drew barrymore does a good janet leigh impression for what littel time she has in the film
,
and david arquette is impressive
. also good
(
and funny
) in his role is henry winkler
(
" the fonz
"
) as the school principal
. i took half a point off for the unnecessary
( albiet limited
) appearance by friends ' courteney cox as repertwar
, gail edwards
, sidney ' s rival because she covered her mother ' s disappearance
. i hate that show
, i hate those actors
. tehy ' re untalented
, overexposed
,
and overpaid
, imho
,
and i would htikn wes craven isnt smart enough to know those actors are overexposed enough
,
but i suppose he isn ' t
.
