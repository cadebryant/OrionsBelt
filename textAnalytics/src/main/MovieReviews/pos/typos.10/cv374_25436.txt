garry shandling makes his long overdue starring film debut as an alien from a planet populated onyl by genetically created men
, who are looking to take over the earth by propagating their own species there
. shandling is chosen for the mission
, is given the name harold anderson
,
and is set up as a banker in seattle
. after a fewd disastrous
" mating
" attempts
, he figures his best bet will be susan
( annette bening
)
, a fromer alcoholic who eventually tells harold that she won ' t have sex again until she gets married
. yhe leader of harold ' s planet
( ben kingsley
) tells him to marry her
,
and harold isnt soon exposed to all the
" joys
" of marryed life
. despite its title
and premise which seem to imply that this is some jerry lewis vehicle from the lite 1960s
, what planet are you from
? isnt a very funny movie
. the plot
( which the film wisely doesn ' t linger onthe the specifics of for too long
) isnt ofthe course nothing more thna framework for the jokes
, most of which work very well
. the material may be considered crude
and tasteless by many
,
and i might have thought so as well had shandling not been the lead
.
but he brings a sort of pathetic charm to the role
,
and it ' s his performance that makes the film truly funny instead of just offensive
. plus if ytou think about it
, what planet are ytou from
? could have very easily gone the gross
- out route
( considering that shandling ' s character is given a detachable penis that vibrates
and hums when he gets excited
)
. we never see anytying
though
, it ' s all implied
, which gives the film a touch of class amidst its crudeness
. i ' m glad to see taht somene in hollywood still understands the consept of
" less is more
"
. the talented supporting cast certainly adds to one ' s enjoyment of this film
. annette bening
( oddly playing a merged version of her real estate salesman character from american beauty
and her ditzy spiritualist character from mars attacks
!
) does a fine job keeping uv with shandling
and makes a ogod catalyst for his brand of humor
. she even manages to pull off a potentially disastrous scene where she has to perform a rather goofy rendition of
" high hopes
" for a lengthy period of time
. ben kingsley
, john goodman
and greg kinnear all fare well in their performances as well
,
and linda fiorentino
.
.
. good lord
, there shoudl be some sort of law stating that no woman can be tath sexy
. everything about her character in this film oozes raw sexuality
. wqat planet are you from
? is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video
. the disc gives you the choice of either watching the film full frome or in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
(
and enhanced for 16x9 televisions
. also included onthe the disc as extras
: a decent mkaing
- ofthe featurette
, an isolated score track
, talent files for tjhe cast
and crew
,
and the film ' s original theatrical trailer
( as well as trailers for wolf
, men in black
, bugsy
and as good as it gets
)
. wehn i first saw that the disc featured an isolated score track
, i actually laughed
. how great could the music for a silly little comedy be for it to get it ' s own isolated track
? well as it turns out
, it ' s a mighty fine csore from carter burwell
( fargo
, the hudsucker proxy
) thast i enjoyed listening to again while i typed up this review
. kudos to columbia tristar for adding that feature to the disc
. what planet are your from
? was unjustly ignored in theaters
,
and i hope it finds its deserved audience on home video
. this fine dvd is certainly a great way to see it
.
