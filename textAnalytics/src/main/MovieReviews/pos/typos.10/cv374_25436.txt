garry sh
andling makes his long overdue starring film de
but as an alien from a planet populated only by genetically created men
, who are looking to take over the earth by propagating their own species there
. sh
andling is chosen for teh mission
, is given tyhe name harold
anderson
, anbd is set up as a banker in seattle
. after a few disastrous
" mating
" attempts
, he figures his best bet will be susan
( annette bening
)
, a former alcoholic who eventually tells harold that she won
' t have sex agina until she gets marryed
. thge leader of harold
' s planet
( ben kingsley
) tells him to marry her
, anbd harold is soon exposed tothe all the
" joys
" ofthe married life
. despite its title
and premise which seem to imply that this is some jerry lewis vehicule ffrom the lite 1960s
, what planet are you from
? is a very funny movie
. the plot
( which the film wisely doesn
' t linger on the specifics of for too long
) is of course nothing more than framework for the jokes
, most of whitch work very well
. the material may be considered crude
and tasteless by many
,
and i might have
thought so as well had sh
andling not been the lead
.
but he brings a sort of pathetic charm tothe tje role
,
and it
' s his performance that makes the film truly funny instead ofthe just offensive
. plus if you think about it
, what planet are you from
? could have very easily gone hte gross
- out route
( considering that sh
andling
' s character is given a detachable penis that vibrates
and hums whn he gets excited
)
. we never see anything
though
, it
' s all implied
, which gives thte film a touch of class amidst its crudeness
. i
' m glad to see that someone iin hollywood still underst
ands the concept of
" less is more
"
. the talented supporting cast certainly adds to one
' s enjoyment of this film
. annette bening
( oddly playing a merged version of her real estate salesman character from american beauty
and her ditzy spiritualist character from mars attacks
!
) does a fine job keeping uv with sh
andling
and makes a ogod catalyst for his br
and of humor
. she even manages to pull off a potentially disasterous scene where she has to perform a rather goofy rendition of
" high hopes
" for a lengthy perido of time
. ben kingsley
, john goodman
and greg kinnear all fare well in their performances as well
,
and linda fiorentino
.
.
. good lord
, there should be some sort of law stating that no woman can be that sexy
. everything about her character in this film oozes raw sexuality
. what planet are you from
? is available on dvd fomr columbia tristar home video
. the disc gives yuo the choice of either watching the film full frame or in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
(
and enhanced for 16x9 televisions
. also included on the disc as extras
: a decent making
- of featurette
, an isolated score tarck
, talent files for the cast
and crew
,
and the film
' s original theatrical trailer
( as well as trailers for wolf
, men in black
, bugsy
and as good as it gets
)
. whn i first saw that the disc featured an isolated score track
, i atcually laughed
. how great could the music for a silly little comedy be for it to git it
' s own isolated track
? well as it turns out
, it
' s a mighty fine score from carter burwell
( fargo
, the hudsucker proxy
) that i enjoyed listening to again while i typed up htis review
. kudos to columbia tristar for adding that feature to the disc
. what planet are your from
? was unjustly ignored in theaters
,
and i hope it finds its deserved audience on home video
. this fine dvd is certainly a great way to see it
.
