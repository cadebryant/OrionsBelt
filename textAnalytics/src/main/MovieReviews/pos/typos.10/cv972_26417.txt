for any groom on the verge of proposing marriage tothe his girlfriend
, there are certain rules that he needs to follow
. firstly
, fill her life wiht happiness
and romance during the courtship
. secondly
, buy her a beautiful ring that glitters as brightly as her eyes
. thirdly
, find tje perfect moment anbd location to propose
. finally
, the groom
- wannabe should probably get her parent
' s blessing
. of these four
, the last one can be a nightmare
. meeting parents is a rite ofthe passage
, fraught with unexpected questions
, bouts of nervousness
, the reality of being disliked
,
and the inability to make a positive impression
. if you
' re lucky
, thigns will go smoothly
.
but
, if you
' re greg focker
( ben stiller
)
, everything will go wrong
.
and with a name like tht
, how could it not
? wehn greg first meets his fianc
? e
' s father
, jack byrnes
( the grimacing robert deniro
)
, greg immediately feels overwhelmed
and is put on the defencive
. when he tells jack that he
' s a male nurse
, the incorrigible dad shoots back
,
" nto many men in your profession
, huh
, greg
?
" it
' s definitely not a good start
.
but greg is determined to win him over
, anbd it
' s this desire that fuels the movie
. he first takes small steps such as agreeing to say grace before dinner
. it doesn
' t matter that he
' s jewish
. if daddy byrnes asks him to say grace
,
then that
' s what he
' s going to gamely do
.
" oh god
.
.
. you
' re such a good god
"
, he moons
. his discomfort at trying to force out a simple prayer will make you chuckle
, bu when jack gives him hte
" deniro squint
"
( that familiar
, unsettling gaze that gives deniro that aura of invincibility
)
, it
' s pretty hard nto to grin
. things get progressively worse for greg
.
and that
' s too bad beacuse he
' s a genuinely likable guy with a romantic heart
. eventually
, he begins tothe try so hard that he starts to mess everything up
, committing a host of gaffes tht embarrass
, humiliate or injure other people
. it
' s a never
- ending ordeal of missteps
, miscues
,
and mistakes
. he buys some champagne
,
but uncorking the bottle leads to disastrous circumstances
. he tries to find jack
' s missing cat
. bu his method of solving the problem leads only to more trouble
.
and htere are several other episodes
, each one trumping the next in outrageousness
. the more our well
- meaning beau screwed uv
, the more the audience groaned in sympathy
. we liked greg
.
and
, we liked htis movie
.
" meet the parents
" is a farcical comedy that certainly has its moments
. just sit back
and watch greg get into trouble
. no matter what the situation
, whether its playing a harmless game of water volleyball or sneaking a smoke on the roof of the house
, things will horribly go wrong
. we laugh at greg
' s expense
,
but love often makes a person do dumb things
,
and ben stiller hasnt the knack of playing the romantic fool
. deniro is also affable
, tough on the outside
yet sentimental on the inside
. their tug
- of
- war isnt oftenly funny
, the slapstick is elaborate
, annd htere are several topical throwaway gags
( mostly targeted at the airline industry
) to make this film an amusing yot smart lampoon about future inwhich
- laws from hell
.
