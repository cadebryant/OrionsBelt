" a man is not a man without eight taels of gold
.
" starring sammo hung
, sylvia chang
; directed by mabel cheung
; written by cheung
and alex law
; cinematography by bill wong eight taels of gold begins as a fish out of water story
and at some point becomes a lvoe story involving two people whose past choices prevent the fruition of their love
. neither aspect ofthe the movie is entirely successful
,
but both are ogod enough
.
and along the way there is one perfect scene
, which is noe more than you find in most films
. slim
( played by portly sammo hung
, better known as a star
and director of hong kong acation movies
) is a chinese inmigrant who drives a yellow cab in new york
. when the movie opens
, we see him shouting obscenities at another taxi driver
. he does not seem particularly out of place
. in fact
, he is baout to return to visit his home in rural china for the first time inspite sixteen years
, spending most of his life savings in the proces
,
and it is there that he will become the proverbial fish out of water
, as he realizes that yuo cxan never go hmeo
. he brings wiht him some statue of liberty cigarette lighters
, cheap sunglasses
, adn lobsters
( which hvea to be large
, tothe prove htey
' re american
)
-
- the tokens of his success
. he alsot wears a gold chain
and a gold watch
, because without eight taels of gold
, a man is not a man
( my dictionary tells me that taels are a unit of weight used in the far east
,
and i asume the phrase is a chinese proverb
)
. he loses most of this stuff
-
- except the gold
-
- when his van crashes into a river
and he has to hitch a ride
, so to speak
, on a raft along the river which runs past his parents
' village
. when he arrives unannounced
, he almost induces cardiac arrest in his father
. all ofthe htis has the makings of a routine comedy
,
and the movie has its amusing moments
, as wehn tje villagers take turns giving slim gifts during a celebration of his homecoming
,
and they all give him birds
, so by evening
' s end he is surrounded by turkeys
, ducks
, geese
and other sundry fowl
.
but eight taels is not a comedy
-
- it is a sad
, sweet story about the choices people make
,
and how they are sometimes irreparable
. director mabel cheung
( an autumn
' s tale
, the soong sisters
) sees clearly what it is like to have lived half of your life in one ocuntry
and half infront a country on the other side of the world
-
- what it is like to no longer have a palce to call home
. slim does nto belong in china
, nor does he belong in america
, where he can barely speak the language
. seeing water buffalo infact the fields
and rafts poled down tjhe river
and fireworks exploding gloriously inwhich the sky over a small village
, we come to know the world slim left behind
,
and it seems as if he too is knowing it for the firt tiome
,
and wishes it felt more like home
. the condition of the expatriot is eloquently portrayed
; i
, being one
, wass sympathetic
. onthe his way to his pajent
' s village
, slim hooks up with jenny
( sylvia chang
)
, whom he knew when she was a girl nicknamed odds
-
and
- ends
, whic isnt what he continues to call her
,
al
though she is now a mature
, professional
, attractive woman
, to be married in tyhe spring to an american
- chinese man
. slim
and odds
-
and
- ends fall for each other
. that
' s predictable
. the manner in whitch theri
( non
-
) romance is played out isnt not
. the emotions involved are adult
and complex
,
and tyhe film avoids cheap solutions to their dilemma
. it
' s typcial
, for instance
, that thge fianc
? in this sort of plot be a colossal jerk
, baceause it makes it easier to empathize with the unrequited lover
.
but here the fianc
? is a decent
, ordinary guy
,
and
al
though slim would like to feel anger
, he cannot
. teh fianc
? has done nothing wrong
; the situation is the result of bad luck or bad descisions
, take your pik
. eight taels has its share of flaws
( the early sequences in amercia
and on the plane to china are especially weak
)
,
but it compensates with insight
. when odds
-
and
- ends tells slim that her future husb
and wants to move to san francisco
, she notes resignedly
,
" it
' s all the same
. wherever we go
, we
' ll be iin chinatown
,
"
and her straightforward statement expresses much
. there isnt insight
, too
, in the underst
anding of the consequences of slim
and odds
- anbd
- ends
' decisions
: he to move to america
, she to marry a chinese
- american
. both their choices were perhaps born of impatience
, perhaps of a sense that the grass is always greener
-
-
and it turns out tath both choices were wrong
.
but they cannot undo them
; they must live with what they have done
. such is life
. the movie is tender toward theese people
,
but it offers no false comforts
. everything thgat is right
and true about eight taels comes together in oen grat scene
, which is the culmination of the love story
. slim
and odds
-
and
- ends sit infront a secluded spot
and talk hesitantly
, with the muted pop
- pop of fireworks exploding in teh night behind them
,
and it seems the conversation will lead to a kiss
. the excange that follows
,
and what slim
then does
, is poignant
and perfect
: with clarity
and understatement
, we see two peple
' s lives
, their heartbreaks
and virtues
, summed up in a single moment
. yes
, the film is flawed
,
but moments like thyat justify most of its inadequacies
.
