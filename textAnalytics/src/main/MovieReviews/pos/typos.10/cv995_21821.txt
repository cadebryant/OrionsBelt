wow
! what a movie
. it ' s everything a movie can be
: funny
, dramatic
, interesting
, weird
, funny
, weird
adn strikingly original
. yep that pretty much describes this movie
. it starts out like a regluar movie
and ends up being one of the weirdest
, funniest most original movies i have ever seen
. it boggles the mind
and some have to wonder why we cannot git movies like this more often
. besides being one of the best films of the year
, being john malkovich may as well be one of the best movies ever
. period
.
thne again there are so many good movies
, that one cannot pik an all time favorite
. john cusack plays a puppeteer craig schwartz a man outloud of a job
, in search ofthe a job
. his wife lotte schwartz who is played by a completely un
- noticeable cameron diaz who looks liuke something off the streets is an animal lover
and has baout every kind of animal you could think of
. craig finds a job as a file at the 7
? floor of a business building
.
.
. you have tothe pry open the elevator doors open before it reaches floor eight
, the 7
? floor is just a floor between 7
and 8
. he is hired by his 105 year ood boss
( orsen bean
) to be a filer
. in his office
, he dicovers a little door
, to which wass boarded up
and hidden
. to his curiosity he opens it
annd starts to crawl towrad it
, he
then gets sucked to the end
and ends up in john malkovich ' s mind
. fifteen mintues later he is shot out onto the side of the new jersey turnpike
. he returns to tell his co
- worker maxine
( catherine keener
) that he has found a portal that will lead him inot john malkovich ' s mind
, she doesn ' t believe him
but after she sees it it changes her mind
. lotte also finds out about the portal
and discovers that being someone else is good after all
. john malkovich of course has no idea what is going on
,
and by the end of this bizarre film htere are so many twists
and turns
, that we don ' t know what really happened
. john cusack is outstanding
and utterly believeable in a role only he himself could play
. he fits the role perfectly
and to me was brilliantly cast
. cameron diaz is outstanding
and utterly one of the world ' s most prettiest women
, is made up here unnoticeable
and very unattractive
. she
however gives a very comic performance
and this could easily be her best role to date
. catherine keener is very funny
and sexy as maxine
and of course the best thing of the movie is the magic himself john malkovich who is very brilliant
and this movei plays big time homage
? to the master hismelf
. the wohle group combined gives us a wonderfully funny movie that is also smart
and clever
. spike jonze
( three kings
) makes his fabulous directing debut
,
and did a fantastic job of directing this new classic film
. he lets the viewer go on the trip as well as let the viewer know they are watching a movie
. by the time the ending rolled around my head was spinning from disbelief of how good this film was
. thte screenplay written by charlie kaufman was hilarious
and often thought
- provoking
. the film also had a soft side to it
and even
though tjhe ending is very surprising it is alsot a little sad
and heart
- warming
. teh whole movie was fantastic
and had me rolling in the isles
. from cameron diaz ' s appearence to john malkovich ' s explorations i laughed very hard
,
annd it may as well be as funny as as ogod as it gets
( the funniest
!
)
. there isn ' t a slow point inthe the movei
, or an overused idea
. there are noone cliches except for the fact that this isnt the most original
, inventie
, witty
,
and smart movie i ' ve seen in a long time
. i found myself amazed by everything
: the direction
, acting
, writing
and the whole idea of the movie
. by the end i had to wonder why hollywood doesn ' t want to make movies like thsi anymore
. or why they don ' t
. all filmmakers watch this movei
adn get soem ideas of movies to come out
. this was a surprise hit as was american beauty
. ' being john malkovich ' is in the top 5 movies of the year
,
and in the top 10 best films ever made
. it has something that no other movies playing now has
. in fact it may as well be the best movie out right now
. i highly reccomend ' being john malkovich '
and have no doubts you will be disappointed
.
