wow
! what a movie
. it
' s everything a movie can be
: funny
, dramatic
, interesting
, weidr
, funny
, weird
and strikingly original
. yep that pretty much describes this movie
. it starts out like a regular movie
and ends up being one ofthe the weirdest
, funniest most origional movies i have ever seen
. it boggles the mind
and some have to wonder why we cannot get movies liek this more often
. besides being one of the best films of the eyar
, being john malkovich may as well be one ofthe the best movies ever
. period
.
then again htere are so many good movies
, tyhat one cannot pick an all time favorite
. john cusack plays a puppeteer craig schwartz a man out of a job
, in search of a job
. his wife lotte schwartz who is played by a completely un
- noticeable cameron diaz who looks like something off the streets is an animal lover
and has about every kind of animal you could think of
. craig finds a job as a file at the 7
? floor of a business building
.
.
. you have to pry open the elevator doors open before it reaches floor eight
, tghe 7
? floor is just a floor between 7
and 8
. he is hired by his 105 year old boss
( orsen bean
) to be a filer
. in his office
, he discovers a little door
, tothe which was boarded up
and hidden
. to his curiosity he opens it
and starts to crawl toward it
, he
then gets sucked to the end
and ends up in john malkovich
' s mind
. fifteen minutes later he is shot out onto the side of the new jersey turnpike
. he returns to tell his co
- worker maxine
( catherine keener
) that he has found a portal that will lead him inot john malkovich
' s mind
, she doesn
' t believe him
but affter she sees it it changes her mind
. lotte also finds out about the portal
and discovers that being someone else is good after all
. john malkovich of course has no idea whta is going on
,
and by the end of tihs bizarre film there are so many twists
and turns
, that we don
' t know what realy happened
. john cusack is outst
anding
and utterly believeable in a role only he himself could play
. he fits the role perfectly
and to me was brilliantly cast
. cameron diaz is oust
anding
and utterly one of the world
' s most prettiest women
, is made up here unoticeable
and very unattractive
. she
however gives a very comic performance
and this could easily be her best role to date
. catherine keener is very funny
and sexy as maxine
and of course the best thing of the movie is the magic himself john malkovich who is very brilliant
and this movie plays big time homage
? to the master hismelf
. the whole group combined gives us a wonderfully funny movie that is also smart
and clever
. spike jonze
( three kings
) makes his fabulous directing de
but
,
and did a fantastic job of directing this new classic film
. he lets the viewer go onthe thte trip as well as let the viewer know they are watching a movie
. by the time the ending rolled around my head was spinning from disbelief of how ogod tihs film was
. the screenplay written by charlie kaufman was hilarious
and often
thought
- provoking
. the film also had a soft side to it
and even
though the ending is veyr surprizing it is also a little sad
and heart
- warming
. the whole movie was fantastic
and had me rolling in the isles
. fomr cameron diaz
' s appearence to john malkovich
' s explorations i laughed very hard
, annd it may as well be as funny as as good as it gets
( the funniest
!
)
. there isn
' t a slow point in the movie
, or an overused idea
. htere are no cliches exept for thge fact thyat this is the most original
, inventie
, witty
,
and smart movie i
' ve seen in a long time
. i found myself amazed by everything
: the direction
, acting
, writting
and the whole idea of the movie
. by the end i had tothe wonder why hollywood doesn
' t want to make movies like this anymore
. or why they don
' t
. all filmmakers watch this movei anbd get some idesa of movies to come out
. tihs was a surprise hit as was american beauty
.
' being john malkovich
' isnt in the top 5 movies of the year
,
and in the top 10 best films ever made
. it has something that no otehr movies playing now has
. in fact it may as well be the best movie outloud right now
. i highly reccomend
' being john malkovich
'
and have no doubts you will be disappointed
.
