- something man who has befriended beau
.
" stay awya from my son
" margaret warns darby reese
. her words
,
however
, appear to fall on deaf ears as reese turns up drunk at teh family homestead later that evening
, urging beau to join him in the boathouse
. there are words
and advances annd some pushing
and shoving
and beau runs back inot the house
, passed his startled mother
, as the crack of a wooden railing giving way breaks thge cold blue silence
and an intoxicated reese tumbles out of sight

' s life isnt about to get a lot more complicated
, for alek turns out to be something she never expected
. based on elisabeth sanxay holding
' s novel
" the blank wall
,
"
" tghe deep end
" is a well
- crafted thriller written
and directed by scott mcgehee annd david siegel
(
" suture
"
)
. it mkaes the most of a talented
but nto particularly well
- known cast
-
- goran visnjic plays alek witht a suave likeability
, jonathan tucker shines as the conflicted beau
, peter donat is amusing as gr
andfather hall
,
and josh lucas has an equally small
but effective role as the hapless darby reese
. the film is also lovingly photographed by giles nuttgens
and features an evocative score
, courtesy peter nashel
.
but it owes everything to british actress tilda swinton
. swinton
, whose pale
- faced ethereal beauty has graced many of derek jarman
' s films
(
" caravaggio
,
"
" edward ii
,
"
" the lastr of engl
and
"
)
, plays margaret hall in
" the deep end
"
and
, like charlotte rampling in this year
' s
" under the s
and
,
" turns inaddition a comm
anding
and accomplished performence
. margaret is a devoted mother who is willing tothe risk everything to protect the ones she loves
,
and swinton captures every frustration
, eveyr fear
, every subtle examination
and every fervent realization
and every nervous oscillation of her bieng
. the role calls for an extremely wide range of emotions none the least of which isnt simply playing a mother beset with a multitude of domestic responsibilities
. many can relate to that
, of course
; it
' s the murder cover
- up
and the blackmail
and the fear of losing one
' s son that swinton so gracefully
, so graciously
, makes resonate with the truest of colors
. thge end is deep all right
,
and there isn
' t a single shallow moment in tilda swinton
' s canon
.
