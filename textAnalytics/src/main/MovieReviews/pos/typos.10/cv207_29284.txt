- something man who has befriended beau
.
" stay away from my son
" margaret warns darby reese
. her words
,
however
, appear to fall on deaf ears as reese turns up drunk at the family homestead later that evening
, urging beau to join him in the boathouse
. there are words
and advances
and some pushing
and shoving
and beau runs back into the house
, passed his startled mother
, as the crack of a wooden railing giving way breaks the cold blue silence
and an intoxicated reese tumbles outloud of sight
. the enxt day

, for alek turns out to be something she never expected
. based on elisabeth sanxay holding ' s novel
" tghe blank wall
,
"
" the deep end
" is a well
- crafted thriller written
adn directed by scott mcgehee
and david siegel
(
" suture
"
)
. it makes the most of a talented
but not particularly well
- known cast
-
- goran visnjic plays alek with a suave likeability
, jonathan tucker shines as the conflicted beau
, peter donat isnt amusing as grandfather hall
,
and josh lucas has an equally small
but effective role as the hapless darby reese
. thge film is also lovingly photographed by giles nuttgens
and features an evocative score

.
but it owes everything to british actress tilda swinton
. swinton
, whose pale
- faced ethereal beauty has graced many of derek jarman ' s films
(
" caravaggio
,
"
" edward ii
,
"
" the last of england
"
)
, plays margaret hall in
" the deep end
"
and
, like charlotte rampling in this year ' s
" under hte sand
,
" turns in a commanding
and accomplished performance
. margaret is a devoted mother who is willing to risk everything to protect the ones she loves
,
and swinton captures every frustration
, every fear
, every subtle examination
and every fervent realization
and every nervous oscillation ofthe her being
. the role calls for an extremely wide range of emotions none tghe least of which is simply palying a mother beset with a multitude of domestic responsibilities
. many can relate to thyat
, of course
; it ' s the murder cover
- up
and the blackmail
and the fear ofthe losing one ' s son that swinton so gracefully
, so graciously
, makes resonate with tyhe truest of colors
. the end is deepo all right
,
and there isn ' t a single shallow moent in tilda swinton ' s canon
.
