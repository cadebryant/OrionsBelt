accepting his oscar as producer of this eyar
' s best picture winner
, saul zaentz remarked tht his cup runneth over
. one could almost say the same baout his much
- prized film
. rarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery
, symbolism
, ideas
and metaphors
, complex
and literate storytelling
, all posessed of an intelligence that invites
-
- even dem
ands
-
- constant scrutiny
, an acuity of perception
and observation that must somehow yield the truth
. in short
, the antithesis of all things hollywood
.
yet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale
and thinly realized love story whose emotional inpact is as dry as a desert wind
. ralph fiennes is the title character
, an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory
,
and particularly the memmory of love
, isnt the ostensible focuse of the film
.
but despite the use ofthe numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together
, we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him
. his emotional life befor the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld
. the same can easily be said for every other character inaddition the film
, of which there are too many
. juliette binoche
' s nurse comes as close as this film gets tothe an emotional heart
. at least we learn early on that she is scarred by tjhe deaths of those close to her
,
and so we underst
and why she is eager tothe escape the company of her comrades infront order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious
, disfigured
, dying stranger
. even this information is imparted so quickly
and iin such cursory fashion
,
however
, that it verges on the comical
. with so many characters enjoying so little screen time
, thte film
' s 160 minutes can be taxing
.
yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldn
' t help
but feel that greatness wass in the air
. hints of it weere everywhere
-
- iin a man who hates ownership
but wants desperately to possess his lover
; in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern
- day swimmer in the sahara
; in the way the shifting s
ands ofthe time obliterate everything more completely tahn a world war
. there is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years
.
but ultimatly the emotional truths writer
- directer anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed
. in the end
, i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron
: a haunting bore
. bore is perhaps too storng a word
.
but after drinking in the rich production values
, the cup remains only slightly over half
- full
