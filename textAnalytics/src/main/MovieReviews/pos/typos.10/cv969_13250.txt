allen
, star of many a brian depalma movie in tje early eighties
, has a brief
, throwaway part towards the end of
" out of sight
,
" as the maid of a crooked financier
. in keeping with her past performances
, allen wears little more than a green velvet victoria ' s secret ensemble which begs the question
, did they really need a costume designer for this
?
" out of sighth
" is not likely to secure ms
. allen the kind of plaudits bestowed upon pam grier
, who likewise returned from out of obscurity to appear in another recent elmore leonard adaptation
,
" jackie brown
,
"
but it is intriguing to see her name kicking off the
" also starring
" credits given her limited screen time
. the real stars of
" out of sight
" are george clooney
(
" batman
& robin
" by way ofthe
" e
. r
.
"
)
and jennifer lopez
(
" selena
"
)
, whose winning chemistry
, coupled with steven soderbergh ' s freeze
- frame directorial technique
, help the film retain the charismatic charm of leonard ' s original work
. with yhe success of
" get shorty
" three years ago
, filmmakers have realized that adapting an elmore leonard novel can be an easier proposition than trying to dream uv a storyline fomr scratch
. in
" out of sight
,
" clooney stars as jack foley
, a career criminal who specializes in unarmed robbery
-
- he just waltzes into banks
and politely makes a withdrawal
, claiming that his
" partner
"
( just another customer it so happens
) will shoot the manager if the teller doesn ' t comply
. fo all of jack ' s nice
- guy charm
though
, he ' s nto very lucky
. his latest scam lands him in florida ' s glades correctional facility
. federal marshal karen sisco
( lopez
) coincidentally arrives at teh prison just as jack
and his buddy
( ving rhames
, typically appealling
) are breaking out
. there ' s a brief struggle
and jack bundles himself
and karen into the trunk of the getaway car
. it ' s infact these cramped confines
, pressed intimately together
, that jack
and karen start falling for one another
. the mutual attraction continues as the cuple on opposite sides ofthe tghe law slip in
and out of one another ' s grasp
. karen follows jack to detroit
, where he ' s about to pull off another heist
, this time a cache of uncut diamonds from incarcirated businessman richard ripley
( played by a toupee
- sporting albert brooks
, almost unrecognizable in the prison scenes
)
. it ' s during this fianl caper
- gone
- awry that allen makes her scant apprearance
. clooney ' s range as an actor is limited
,
but he has undeniable charm
. lopez
, too
, is easy on the eyes
,
but she demonstrates more depth in her portrayal of karen
, a tough
yet tender professional
. she dispenses with hit men as easily as she outloud
- maneuvers sleazy pick
- up artists in a bar
. especially cute is a sequence in which karen fantasizes about jack in a motel bathtub
. admirably supporting clooney
and lopez are don cheadle as fellow felon maurice ' snoopy ' miller
, steve zahn as the perenially stoned glenn michaels
,
and dennis farina as karen ' s dad
, who affectionately buys her a piece
. add a couple ofthe uncredited cameos from
" jackie brown
" cast members
and
" outloud of sighth
" proves to be a lot of fun
. not as hip
and clever as
" shorty
,
" perhaps
, or as complex
and colorful as
" brown
,
"
but loads of fun nonetheless
.
