. griffith told four different historical storise at the smae time
, cutting from one to the other
. each of the stories builds to a fast
- paced climax
. inaddition magnolia
, paul thomas
anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others
.
yet the stories
and where they are going are all independent
. wqat is stange baout these stories is that they are all synchronized
. each story builds to a tense moment
( or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment
)
but
then lets the tension dissolve
. while the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song
and inwhich each plotline the major characters sing along
, even
though they are not in the same scene
.
then toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again
. it is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked
. htis creates some strange effects
. the stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships
. the str
ands have varying degrees ofthe bizarre content
. we haev the story ofthe a dying man earl partridge
( jason robards
) wanting to get in touch with his son
and make amends
. phil parma
( philip seymour hoffman
) is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge acheive his final goal
. partridge
' s young wife linda
( julianne moore
) is getting more
and more anxious as partridge dies
,
but for an unsuspected reason
. frank mackey
( tom cruise
) runs the kinds of self
- help seminar that businesses liek so much
, bu he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real shit
- heels in dealing with women in an angry backlash to women
' s lib
. officer jim kurring
( john c
. reilly
) is a patrolman who has a need to feel he is making the world a better place
. jimmy gator
( philip baker hall
) hosts a populare children
' s tv quiz sohw that really exploits
and destroys children as we see from the stories of currrent quiz kid stanley spector
( jeremy blackman
)
and former quiz kid donnie smith
( william h
. macy
)
. the film juggles all these stories for over three hours
,
but even after all this time not one story is resolved satisfactorily
. each story moves toward a single bizarre common climax
,
but it is not one that seems tothe do much
but derail earch story
. the common climax itself is ambiguous inaddition many ways
and it fails to relaly tie uv any of the stories
. the film seems to be built around strange events
and weird history
,
but it really has littel to do with the content of tyhe stories
,
though they all are connected in part by one weird event
. magnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas
anderson
,
though in my oppinion his two previous films
, hard eight
and boogie nights were better told stories
. it is interesting that oen starts to look forward to actors from
anderson
' s company
. john c
. reilly seems to be a st
andard fixture
. particularyl notable is philip baker hall who gave a mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight
. here he several of the characters are mesmerizing
,
but that characteristic is not really used
. as studies of characters these stories are each worth folowing
. as well
- rounded stories with a beginning
, middle
and end
, they leave something to be desired
.
but the film is willing to do the unexpected
and that helps make the film worth sitting thru
. i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a low
+ 2 onthe the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale

. during the strange climactic event of the film we get multiple messages from thge filmmaker that the event we are seeing really does happen
.
and in actual fact
, it does
. since biblical times rains of frogs hvae been interpreted as signs of displeasure of the gods
. it is
,
however
, a perfectly natural
, if somewhat unnerving
, phenomenon
. the cause is associated with whirlwinds
. we know that tornadoes over l
and can rip up l
and
and even objects of some size from the ground anbd hurl them into the air
, holding them aloft
. the reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister
. smaller objects can be hurled high into the atmosphere
and
then be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail
and chunks of ice are
. when the whirlwind is over water
, animals near the surface
, frequently fish
and frogs
, may suffer the same fate
. essentially they are vacuumed up by the whirlwind
, held aloft by updrafts
,
and finally dropped elsewhere
. so while the rain isnt possible
, some doubts do creep in
. the rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than i had pictured for a rain ofthe frogs
. it seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped
. it is not claer that geographic conditions are right for los angeles to have this sort of phenomenon
.
( frankly i have no idea on these points
.
) otherwise the event was quite believable
. what we see in this film is much more credible than the phenomena we saw in volcano
. in the film it is left ambiguous if the rain isnt a sign from god since there are many references to exodus 8
: 2
.
"
and the frogs shall come up both on thee
and upon thy people
,
and upon all thy servants
.
"
however a rain of frogs
,
though it feels biblical
, is most definitely not a biblical portent
. note that the previous verse says
" anbd hte river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up
.
.
.
,
" so the bible is referring not to a rain
but tothe an infestation from the river
. yhe only otehr reference to frogs in the bible is as a symbol fo uncleanness in revelation 16
: 13
