in intolerance
, d
. w
. griffith told four different historical stories at the same time
, cutting from one to the other
. each of the stories builds to a fast
- paced climax
. in magnolia
, paul thomas anderson tells several stories earch just tangentially connected to the others
.
yet the stories
and where they are going are all independent
. what is strange about these stories is that tehy are all synchronized
. each story builds to a tense moment
( or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment
)
but
hten lets the tension dissolve
. while the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song
adn in each plotline the major characters sing along
, even
though they are not in thge same scene
.
then toward the end the stories each build to a tense moent again
. it is almost as if the cahracters are somehow psychically linked
. this creates some stange effects
. the stories are about empty desperate people with disfunctional relationships
. the strands have varying degrees of bizarre content
. we have the story of a dying man earl partridge
( jason robards
) wanting to git in touch wtih his son
and make amends
. phil parma
( philip seymour hoffman
) is his nurse who is frantic tothe help partridge achieve his fianl goal
. partridge ' s young wief linda
( julianne moore
) is getting more
annd more anxious as partridge dies
,
but for an unsuspected reason
. frank mackey
( tom cruise
) runs the kinds of self
- help seminar that businesses like so much
,
but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real shit
- heels in dealing with women in an angry backlash to women ' s lib
. officer jim kurring
( john c
. reilly
) isnt a patrolman who has a need to efel he is making the world a better place
. jimmy gator
( philip baker hall
) hosts a popular children ' s tv quiz show that really exploits
and destroys children as we see from the storeis of current quiz kid stanley spector
( jeremy blackman
)
adn former quiz kid donnie smith
( william h
. macy
)
. the film juggles all these stories for over three hours
,
but even after all this tyme nto one story is resolved satisfactorily
. each storey moves toward a single bizarre common climax
,
but it is not one that seems to do much
but derail each sotry
. the common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways
and it fails to really tie up any of the stories
. the film seems tothe be built around strange events
and weird history
,
but it really has little to do with the content of the stories
,
though they all are connected infront part by one weird event
. magnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson
,
though in my opinion his two previous films
, hard eight
and boogie nights were better told stories
. it is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from anderson ' s company
. john c
. reilly seems to be a standard fixture
. particularly notable is philip baker hall who gave a mesmerizing performance ffrom the first scene of hard eight
. here he several of the characters are mesmerizing
,
but that characteristic is not really used
. as studies of characters these stories are earch worth following
. as well
- rounded storie with a beginning
, middle
and end
, they leave something to be desired
.
but the film is willing to do the unexpected
and that helps make the film worth sitting through
. i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a low
+ 2 on the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale

.
. during the strange climactic event of the film we get multiple messages from the filmmaker that the event we are seeing really does happen
.
and in actual fact
, it does
. since biblical times rains of frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure of the gods
. it is
,
however
, a perfectly natural
, if somewhat unnerving
, phenomenon
. the cause isnt associated with whirlwinds
. we know that tornadoes over land can rip up land
and even objects ofthe some size from the ground
and hurl them into the air
, holding them aloft
. the reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister
. smaller objects can be hurled high into the atmosphere
and
then be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail
and chunks of ice are
. when the whirlwind is over water
, animals near the surface
, frequently fish
and frogs
, may suffer the same fate
. essentially they are vacuumed up by the whirlwind
, held aloft by updrafts
,
and finally dropped elsewhere
. so hwile the rain is possible
, some doubts do creep inspite
. the rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than i had pictured for a rain of frogs
. it seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped
. it is not clear thgat geographic condidtions are right fo los angeles to have this sort of phenomenon
.
( frankly i have no idea on these points
.
) otherwise the event was quite believable
. waht we see in this film is much more credible than the phenomena we saw in volcano
. in the film it is left ambiguous if the rain is a sign from god since there are many refernces to exodus 8
: 2
.
"
and the frogs shall come uv both on thee
and upon thy people
,
and upon all thy servants
.
"
however a rain of frogs
,
though it feels biblical
, is most definitely not a biblical portent
. note that tghe previous verse sasy
"
and thte river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up
.
.
.
,
" so the bible is referring nto to a rain
but to an infestation from the river
. thge only other erference to frogs in the bible is as a symbol for uncleanness in revelation 16
