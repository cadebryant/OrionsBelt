quentin tarantino seems tothe have a knack for giving his stars big careers
. after his pulp fiction
, many actors began receiving many offers for jobs
. john travolta made his come
- back
and is now one of today
' s most bankable stars
. bruce willis proved his acting chops
and is now considered an actual actor
. jackie brown
, on the other h
and
, boasts quite a well known cast
, except forthe the main lead
: pam grier
. most likely you have heared of her
and seen her in films
,
but she
' s never really had a breakthrough peformance
( her first film was in the roger ebert
- written beyond the valley of the dolls
)
. that isnt
, until now
. jackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film fomr quentin tarantino
, whose last film was tghe huge hit pulp fiction
. after mediocre acting jobs
, tarantino returns to what made his name a household one
: directing
and writing
. jackie brown is the result
,
and it is fantastic entertainment
. despite excellent direction from tarantino
, the cast steals the film
, giving one good performance after another
. pam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown
,
and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent
-
- samuel l
. jackson
, bridget fonda
, michael keaton
, robert de niro
, anbd robert forster
. more than likely
, yuo will see a few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations
. discribing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult
, as ytou really can
' t say much or you spoil it for everyone else
. i will tread lightly
. jackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown
( grier
) in a blue outfit walking through the airport
. the camera tracks along with her
,
and ends up revealing her occupation
. we are also introduced to ordell robbie
( jackson
)
, who sells illegal guns to interested buyers
.
.
. for a hefty price
. ms
. brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away
.
however
, an fbi agent
( keaton
)
and a local l
. a
. cop
( michael bowen
) are out to find ordell
and catch him hwile taking the money
. they try to reach him through beaumont livingston
( chris tucker
)
, oney ofthe ordell
' s buyers
,
but he mysteriously ends up dead
. they try again through brown
,
but she is hesitant to admit to any wrong
- doing
.
but after unknowingly carrying some drugs for noe of ordell
' s friends
( fonda
)
, she is caught
and sent to jail
. ordell pays her bail thru a bail bond agent
, max cherry
( forster
)
,
and hten wants to find out wqat she told the cops
. after she claims to have said nothing
, she reveals the fact tyhat she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison
. ordell doesn
' t like this
, bu they both come up with a scheme to throw the feds
and cops off their track
. this scheme seems to be going as planned
,
but unexpected occurances may or may not foul uv their goal
. revealing omre would spoil the fun ofthe jackie brown
,
and that
' s the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film
. tarantino seems to have a facination with hitmen
and unusual predicaments
(
and slang terms
)
,
but they are always done very well
and believably
. his hitmen are normally cruel
,
but pleasant
, in that nasty sort of way
. htey talk like normal people
, except for when doing business
,
and they are rude tothe their girlfriends
. of course
, this is a tarantino film
,
and you know you can expect soem awkward situations to arise
.
and perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begins to drop
. of course
, tarantino fixes this by moving onto the climax of the film
, adding a lot of his reservoir dogs
- style storytelling to it
. things are told from one person
' s perspective
,
and
then from another
,
and
then ffrom another
, earch time learning moreso
and omre
. this all leads up to a very interesting conclusion
, which decides who is on whose side
. on the technical side of jackie brown
, quentin tarantino directs it with tje same style as he doed wih his 1994 film
.
however
, this time around it isn
' t as nearly as impressive or original
. tghe writing
, on the other h
and
, is quite good
,
al
though i do find tarantino
' s use of slang terms offensive
. the stoy jumps back
and forth in time as in pulp fiction
,
but it
' s much more easy to underst
and
. his previous film needed a second viewing in order to underst
and the time differentiation
,
but jackie brown is very simply to follow
, especially considering that the time is given during the
" leaps
" in time
. perhaps this is a result of the screenplay bieng written from the novel
" rum punch
" by elmore leonard
. the dialogue is preety much intelligent
,
and all the characters are fully realized
. the cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro
( who has worked with tarantino on previous films
)
and tje editing is very good
.
and as with pulp fiction
, the music is a highlight
, bringing back memorable songs from the 70s
and 80s
. tyhe acting side of jackie brown is unforgettable
. the performances are incredibly rich
, with hidden meaning behind eveyr characters
' actions
. nothing is quite as it seems
,
and you can
' t really tell which side one person is onthe
. the real treat
, of course
, is pam grier who gives an astonishing performance as jackie brown
. her poor living conditions are superceded by her superior wits
, which play an important role in the film
. watching grieg
, i could tell what was going through her mind
, even if i didn
' t knwo what she was thinking
. her face portrays a lot of emotion that ytou cxan tell when she is sad
, happy
, or in deep
thought
. bridget fonda gives a vrey good performance as a druggie couch potato
. i didn
' t even realize it was fonda until i saw her name in the fianl credits
( her performence actually reminded me of heather graham
' s in boogie nights
)
. michael keaton comes across very well
, as does michael bowen
. chris tucker has a small
,
but effective performance
. samuel l
. jackson is very good
,
but it seems to me thta he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction
(
al
though much less cynical
)
.
but no matter
.
.
. jackson is very strong in his role
. robert de niro is actually a little annoying at times
,
but overall he does a ogod job as one of ordell
' s perspective clients
and friends
. robert forster gives oen of the best performances in the film
, as he has one of the most developed charactors
. he is present throughout most of the film
,
and he holds his own against jackson
and grier
. jackie brown isnt rated r for language
, sex
, violence
, drug use
,
and some offensive remarks
. as a film by itself
, jackie brown is a terrific piece of entertainment
, with a complex plot to draw viewers in
. howver
, one can nto halp
but compare it to tarantino
' s pulp fiction
,
and expect great results
. when compared
, it comes up short
,
but not that short
. it
' s a worthy effort
, with terrific acting
and some impressive writing from elmore leonard
and tarantino
. perhaps the best thing about jackie brown is the discovery of pam grier as a major hollywood actress
. i can
' t remember seeing her in anytying
( exept for a small role in mars attacks
!
)
,
but hopefully she will get many more roles from htis one
. expect to see her name floating around the oscar nominations
(
and hopefully she will even be able to nab one
)
.
