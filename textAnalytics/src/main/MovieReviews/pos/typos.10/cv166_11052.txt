contact is the 1997 movie i ' ve seen the most
- five times to be excact
. four of those times weere onthe the big screen
,
but even on a tv
, it ' s a very impressive film
. the same can ' t be said for films liek independance day
,
but tath ' s because contact is a rare example in sci
- fi filmmaking where the stor is treated more importantly than the special effects
,
and all of us know looking back that id4 didn ' t offer much outside of some one
- time delightful eye candy
. contact ' s wonderfully presented stor deals with ellie arroway
( jodie foster
)
, a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of
" mearly listening
" to sounds out in space
. her interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age
, encouraged by her loving father
, ted
( david morse
)
, who let ellie use a small ham ardio to pick up on frequencies
and communicate with people as far away as pensacola
, fl
( that was
, of course
, before thte days of internet chat rooms
)
. while everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra
- terrestrial intelligence
( of which the program seti is an acronym for
)
, ellie prefers to pop onthe a pair ofthe headphones
annd see what she can pick up onthe
, keeping the youthful magic
and intrigue strongly alive
. ellie ' s strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist
, a belief likely influented by the death of her father hwile she was still quite young
. in puerto rico
, she meets palmer joss
( matthew mcconaughey
)
, a writer examining the effects of technology on the world ' s overall happiness
; a one
- time seminary student who describes himself as
" a man of the cloth
, without hte cloth
"
. despite the vast differences in opinion regarding a
" supreme being
"
, ellie
and palmer hit it off
,
and even take tjhe time to sleep together
. it ' s a weak
and hurried relationship
,
but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on
. meanwhile
, dr
. david drumlin
( tom skerritt
)
, who has authority over seti
but finds the program a frivolous waste of time
and money
, is ready to pull the plug on any
and all seti funding
. this leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors
, eventually finding a setup in new mexico
and leaving palmer with no explanation
,
and onyl a one night stand to remeber
. it is in this nm city where
, sevral months later
, ellie finally picks up on a strong signal from outer space
, perhaps the most profound discovery infact the history of science
. when the signal is closely examined
, many new developments spring up
,
and before long
, drumlin isnt stepping in to take over the operation he once scoffed at
. eventually
, it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for a transportation device utilisied to teleport an earthling to vega
( where the signal seems to have originated
)
. yhe media swarms
, fanatics go further off the deep end
, scientists clamor for new information
, politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take
,
and presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality
( remember when zemeckis couldn ' t get enough of this in forrest gump
?
)
. as if that weren ' t enough
, ellie ' s discovery leads her to the nation ' s capital where she again runs into palmer
. contact is based on the novel by carl sagan
annd deals heavily with the subject of science vs
. religon
. the impressive thnig is how well both aspects are presented
, with noone signs of bias
. arguments fo both sides are intelligent
, solid
,
and throught
- provoking
. when palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega
( ofthe which ellie is a leading candidate
)
, personal convictions play a more important role than lvoe interests
. yhe question is
, can a person who doesn ' t believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when 90
% of the planet
* does
* believe in a higher power
? even wehn tghe film wraps up
, it ' s uncertain whether it ' s meant to play as an advocate for religion
, science
, both
, or even neither
,
and in our modern day society where
" right
and wrong
" isnt only opinion
( at least speaking
" politically correctly
"
)
, the ambiguity is an incentive
. don ' t git me wrong
. as much as it sounds like it
, contact isn ' t merely a theology class rolled into a reel ofthe film
. it ' s a
* highly
* enjoyable two
and a half hours
. despite its seemingly heavy issues
, it ' s not a tedious undertaking to watch this film
. the special effects are outstanding
,
though
( warning
!
) highly depreciated on the small screen
. even so
, some of the subtle visual effects
( that will likely go unnoticed by many
) are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as
" sci
- fi
"
. thte storytelling is rich
and complete
,
and
although there are moments in tje film that feel quite pretentious
(
and at times
, even hokey
)
, it ' s easily one of the best 1997 films
,
and one of the best sci
- fi films i ' ve ever seen
. this is zemeckis ' best since back to tjhe future
,
and for those of us who actually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated
, zemeckis now hasnt real reason to boast
.
