. be forewarned
. floating life
, australia
' s first
- ever submission tothe the academy of motion picture arts
& sciences for consideration in the best foerign language film category
( its dialogue is in cantonese
, english
,
and german
)
, marks a special accomplishment by clara law
. a compelling
, at times poignant film
, it manages to maintain its truthfulness while teetering between comedy
and melodrama
. floating life centers arund a hong kong family
' s sense ofthe dislocation
and loss of identity after moving to australia in order to avoid the communist takeover of hong kong
,
and is divided into clearly defined vignettes
, eahc chapter labelled with title cards pertaining to houses
, which serves to empahsize the film
' s theme of family
. the film opens with mr
.
and mrs
. chan
( edwin pang
, cecilia fong sing lee
)
and their two teen sons
( toby wong
, toby chan
) leaving the bustling
, claustrophobic metropolis of hong kong to join their second daugter bing
( annie yip
) in australia
. with their spacious
, immaculately
- white new house
and thte vast abundance of neighbourhood greenery
, the chans initially find this serene new l
and a strange
and wonderous one
,
and
- with neurotic bing cooly remarking about the possible dangers of australian life
( killer dogs
, poisonous spiders
, dangerous ultraviolet rays
)
- a frightening one
. this sets up a wonderfully amusing scene early in the film where the four immigrants
, aimlessly ambling about thier new suburban neighbourhood
, are sent scrambling by the yelps ofthe a little white puppy
. the tone set uv early in the film is broadly comic
,
and one expects floating life to depict the clash of cultures as thge chans struggle to acclimatize themselves to the newyorker ways of australian life as they integrate themselves into australian society
( a scene where the twpo teen sons meet up with a sunbathing neighbourhood girl is left dangling
)
,
but the film suddenly veers towords an introspective
and melodramatic tone
. floating life shifts its focuse away from the exploits of thge new immigrants
and towards bing
' s domineering of her newly
- reunited family
, setting out a set of stringent
and oppressive rules which create tremendous tension within the household
and threaten to fracture the family
. meanwhile
, elder duaghter yen
( annette shun wah
)
, happily settled in germany with her husb
and
and young daughter
, begins to suffer an identity crisis
, manifesting itself with her claims to her patiently exasperated husban that their new home isnt cursed with bad feng shui
, adn further exacerbated upon hearing of the familial conflict down under
. among the dramatic threads of floating life
, tihs is perhaps the most effective
and engaging
, with an interesting set of characters
and a storyline which generates a genuine emotional punch
. tje one misguided vignette in floating life involves eldest son gar ming
( anthony wong
)
, left behind in hong kong to resolve various affairs onthe behalf of his famaly
and to await his immigration papers before rejoining his parents
and brothers in australia
. emotionally detatched
and aimlessly drifting
, his isnt an uncompelling character
,
and consequently subsequent attempts to draw out pathos are uninvolving
and ineffective
. his desperate search for emotional fulfillment is depicted by philosopical droning on the exquisite peak of an orgasm
, which quickly becomes tedeous
. ms
. law
' s film cheerfully embraces melodrama
- each ofthe the major vignettes feature excessively emotional climaxes which i couldn
' t help
but find reminiscent to wayne wang
' s acutely unsubtle the joy luck club
-
but despite the director
' s rather clear attempts to tug at the heartstrings
, i couldn
' t help bu be touched by a powerful
and affecting soliloquy delivered masterfully by cecilia fong sing lee which truley packs an emotional wallop anbd
, in dramatic terms
, is certainly the highlight of floating life
. floating life at times spreads itself too thin
; given the myriad of characters involved
, it could either st
and to delve into each vignette a littel deeper
, or narrow its focus to a select gropu of key characters
.
however
, it is a fine film
, with a
thoughtful
and insightful screenplay by clara law
and husb
and eddie ling
- ching fong
,
and soem superb acting by a cast consisting almost exclusively ofthe non
- actors
( special note is to be made of cecilia fong sing lee
, annette shun wah
,
and a short
but dazzling performance by an actress who portrayed gar ming
' s girlfriend from vancouver
)
. floating life is ultimately about the ties that bond a family together
, which are able to withst
and great distances
and new environments
.
