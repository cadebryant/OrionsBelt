much ballyhoo has beeen made over this newyorker version of
" lolita
,
" made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made
, over its use of pedophilia
,
and as such
, it
' s imporatnt to address it straight
- forwardly
, befoer any other ideals such as goodness
and themes can be discussed
, as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years
, lying around in vaults san a distri
butor
,
and haveing critics waiting tothe either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit
. whn seeing this film
, after all the hoopla
, keeping in mind that there are peple
, namely me
, who are fans ofthe the novel
, who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation
.
.
. well
, you just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distri
bution
. what
' s even worse is tyhat seeing this
" lolita
,
" especially the first time
and if you
' re familiar with anything
" lolita
,
" is admittingly very anticlimactic
. tihs isnt a real pity beccause when you relaly sit down to watch this film
, ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it
, it
' s realy quite a film
, perhaps the best film by directer adrian lyne
(
al
though
, really
, look at its competition
:
" flashdance
,
"
" fatal attraction
,
"
and
" indecent proposal
"
)
, at least besides
" jacob
' s ladder
.
" i
' ve seen htis
" lolita
" twice
: the first time
, i wasn
' t so blown away
. it seemed overly dramatic
and surprisingly unaffecting
. the second time
, not really thinking about how i
' ve waited for what seems like forever to see it
and how i
' m seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel
and not a giant movie theatre
, it really affected me emotionally
. the story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one
, which is why it
' s such a ogod novel
,
and why this is such a good film
. the story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14
- year old girl named dolores a
. k
. a
. lolita is gerat baceause it
' s not trash for the perverted
but because it
' s baout human obsession with things that are out of one
' s reach
. its protagonist
, the comically
- named humbert humbert
, is not your averege pedophile
,
but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions
and idosyncrasies
. the character ofthe lolita is alomst a symbol ofthe the forbidden apple infact christian mythology
, something that will destroy us
but that we can
' t live wihtout
. these ideas are all worked into this film nicely
,
but done inaddition a way that is not heavy
- h
anded at all
,
but instead lyrical
and emotionally devastating
. the focus of this film
,
and the reason for making it
, it seems
, was to really penetrate tjhe emotional depths of tjhe novel
and bring them tothe life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images
,
and scenes which are blatantly over
- stylized
. the tone of the book is a comical one
,
but it
' s also a tragic oney
,
and humbert
, telling the story from his perspective
, blows every single thing out of perspective
. humbert exists infront a fantsy world of his obsessions
and desires
,
and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed
. we get a sense that perhaps it
' s by doign this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that iwll ultimately leave him haggard anbd destroyed
. he weeps uncontrollably
and never lets himself get over his original 14
- year
- old love
,
and allows himself to embody her as lolita
. he lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions
,
and by the end
, he hasnt nothing
but overly
- dramatic feelings for her
. the story recognizes the extreme of this
, almost out of a test
, seeing if the readers will really sympathize with somene who is socially deemed a pervert
,
and one almost wonders hwile reading the book if the author
, vladimir nabokov
, wrote the book as a means tothe bring into focus his own sick obsessions
,
and perhaps bring them to peace
. the weirdest thing about this film is tyhat by the end
, when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey
, we cant easily sympathize
and even identify with him
. the oppening
and final images of the film are the same
,
and who hasn
' t done a similar action
, that is w
andering baout without any sense of reality or anything else
but a deep sadness in us
? this is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen
, the first time being filmed in
- shock
- 1962
, by stanley kubrick
, who couldn
' t possibly have broght the novel to the screen wtih as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do
, bu did the next best thing
: he economized for everything
and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general
. in that film
, he used the traps of society as benefits
. the studio dem
anded the final scene
, that of a heinous murder
, come firt in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer
and second as a pedophile
.
.
.
and when you see it
, it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession
. the censors wouldn
' t allow anymore than a cuple glances
and subtle dialogue to show the
, um
, relationship between humbert
and lolita
, so kubrick decided to play it as comedy
,
but still allow the tragedy to seep through
. looking at these two versions
, especially after reading the novel
( adn we all know that when we
' ve read a novel
and see a film adaptation
, we are bound to be angered by any size differences
)
, it
' s really impossible to compare them
. they both go for different things
,
and oen has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was
.
and
al
though it
' s true that several scenes are similar
, annd are thus up for comparison
, overall it
' s unfair to sday which one is better
and which one is worse
. i have never been noe for saying yhe level of greatness of a film adaptions of a novel is deemed by how faithful it is
,
and i won
' t say that here
.
however
, this film is pretty amazing
, mostly because hey
, i loved the book
,
and this film nearly reminded me of it
. it doesn
' t have nearly as much wit
( a couple comical scenes
,
and even a lot of good chuckles
,
but just not totally witty
)
,
but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had
. some of that is in the casting of the two leads
. jeremy irons
, with his deep
, soft british voice
and gentle look
, is an amazing humbert
. he
' s droll in a very unique way
,
and
, well
, no oney can look distraught the way he does
. he brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos
and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience
.
and when he looks at lolita with love
,
and she looks at him with lust
, you know that he
' s her prisoner for as long as he lives
. anbd dominique swain
, who plays the title character
, is rather incredible
. she pulls off the tough role even better thna sue lyon did in the original
, wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction
, bratiness
, adn self
- centeredness that marks the character
. it
' s easy to see why she surrenders to humbert
: she loves the attention
,
and knows that she can have her way with him at any time
. when he denies her something
, she blackmails him effortlessly
( a scene involving a rocking chair
and a little foot action is damn near classic
)
,
and when he st
ands up to her
, she weeps
and runs awya
, leaving humbert to follow her
. there are two otehr minor characters in the film
, one who
' s a road block in the beginning
,
and the other who
' s a reappearing threat to yhe relationship
. the former is charlotte
, lolita
' s mother
, played by melanie griffith
. in thge book
, charlotte is a monster of a woman
: overbearing
, constantly scolding her child
, overly
- religious
,
and ultimately selfish
.
and she
' s tjhe noe obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal
, at least in the beginning
. as played by shelly winters inthe the original
, she represented all these qualities
; as played by griffith here
, she
' s about half ofthe them
. it
' s annoying to watch a film
and play a game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first
.
and even
though griffith is nto really bad
, persay
, she
' s nothing more
. hte other is clare quilty
, the writer who is also trying to seduce lolita
,
and succeeds
,
but at a price
. langella takes a totally different direction than the one peter sellars tookover in the original
. quilty was a comic character in the original
: a threat in the form of many forms
, popping in states of rambling
, german
, proning
,
and eventially drunk
. langella takes the other route
, allowing all of thte creepiness to be unearthed
,
and the result isnt a character who exists inthe shadows
and low shots
,
and who meets a wonderfully ironic ending
, the exact opposite of whta we
thought of him
. as you can see
, most ofthe these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne
and his screenwriter
, stephen schiff
,
but just parts of a whole new look at the novel
, at least cinema
- wise
. this version is beautiful
,
and perpetually saddening
. the camera movements are stylized
,
and each shot is breathtakingly rich
. the acting is for the most part wonderfull
,
and when we watch it
, we really get a sence tht for humbert
, who is telling the story
, tjhe only two people on earth most of the time were humbert
and lolita
. more importantly
, it tkaes us right up the brink of emotion
,
then jumps right over it
. by the end
, wiht humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car
, following what he says is the only part of his life he doesn
' t regret
, we feel that we all loose to something we can never have
.
