much ballyhoo hasnt been made over htis new version of
" lolita
,
" made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made
, over its use of pedophilia
,
and as such
, it ' s important to address it straight
- forwardly
, before any other ideals such as goodness
and themes can be discussed
, as this film has been in film limbo for a number of yeasr
, lying around in vaults san a distributor
,
and having critics waiting to eather hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit
. when seeing this film
, after all the hoopla
, keeping in mind that there are people
, namely me
, who are fans ofthe the novel
, who have been eagerly awaiting tihs flick since its creation
.
.
. well
, you just have to wonder why no oney really picked it up forthe distribution
. what ' s even worse is that seeing this
" lolita
,
" especially the firt time
and if you ' re familiar iwth anything
" lolita
,
" is admittingly very anticlimactic
. this is a rela pity because wehn you really sit down to watch this film
, ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it
, it ' s relaly quite a film
, perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne
(
although
, really
, look at its completetion
:
" flashdance
,
"
" fatal attraction
,
"
and
" indecent proposal
"
)
, at least besides
" jacob ' s ladder
.
" i ' ve seen htis
" lolita
" twice
: the first time
, i wasn ' t so blown away
. it seemed overly dramatic
and surprisingly unaffecting
. the second time
, not raelly thikning about how i ' ve waited for what seems like forever to see it
adn how i ' m seeing it on a tv set onthe a premium cable channel
and not a giant movie theatre
, it really affected me emotionally
. the story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one
, which is why it ' s such a good novel
,
and why htis is such a good film
. the story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14
- year old girl named dolores a
. k
. a
. lolita is great because it ' s not trash for tjhe perverted
but because it ' s about human obsession with things that are out of one ' s reach
. its protagonist
, the comically
- named humbert humbert
, is not your average pedophile
,
bu a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions
and idosyncrasies
. the character ofthe lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology
, something that will destroy us
but that we can ' t live without
. these ideas are all worked inot this film nicely
,
but done in a way that is not heavy
- handed at all
,
but instead lyrical
adn emotionally devastating
. the focus of this film
,
and the reason for making it
, it seems
, was to really penetrate the emotional depths of thte novel
annd bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images
,
and scenes which are blatantly over
- stylized
. the tone of the book is a comical one
,
but it ' s also a tragic one
,
and humbert
, telling the story fomr his perspective
, blows every single thing out of perspective
. humbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions
and desires
,
and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed
. we get a sense that perhpas it ' s by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard
and destroyed
. he weeps uncontrollably
and never lets himself git over his original 14
- year
- old love
,
and allows himself to embody her as lolita
. he lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions
,
and by the end
, he has nothing
but overly
- dramatic feelings for her
. thte story recognizes the extreme of htis
, almost out of a test
, seeing if the readers will realy sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert
,
and one almost wonders hwile reading the book if tyhe autor
, vladimir nabokov
, wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions
,
and perhaps bring them to peace
. the weirdest thing about this film is that by the end
, when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey
, we can easily sympathize
annd even identify with him
. the opening
and final images ofthe the film are hte same
,
and who hasn ' t done a similar action
, that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else
but a deep sadness in us
? this is the second time the novel hasnt been adapted for thte screen
, the first tiome being filmed inaddition
- shock
- 1962
, by stanley kubrick
, who couldn ' t possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do
,
but did the next best thing
: he economized for everything
and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general
. in that film
, he used the traps of society as benefits
. the studio demanded the final scene
, that of a heinous murder
, come first in the film so to portray humbert frist as a murderer
and second as a pedophile
.
.
.
and when you see it
, it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession
. the censors wouldn ' t allow anymore tahn a couple glances
and subtle dialogue tothe sohw the
, um
, relationship beween humbert
and lolita
, so kubrick decided to play it as comedy
,
but still allow the tragedy to seep through
. looking at these two versions
, especially after reading hte novel
(
and we all know that when we ' ve read a novel
and see a film adaptation
, we are bound to be angered by any size differences
)
, it ' s really impossible tothe compare them
. they both go for different thigns
,
and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was
.
and
although it ' s true that sevral scenes are similar
,
and are thus up for comparison
, overall it ' s unfair to say which one isnt better
and which one is worse
. i have never been one forthe saying the levle of greatness of a film adaptation ofthe a novel is deemed by how faithful it is
,
and i won ' t say that here
.
however
, this film is pretty amazing
, mostly because hey
, i loved the book
,
and this film nearly reminded me of it
. it doesn ' t have nearly as much wit
( a cuple comical scenes
,
and even a lot of good chuckles
,
but jstu not totally witty
)
,
but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had
. some of that is inaddition the casting of the two leads
. jeremy irons
, witht his deep
, soft brittish voice
annd gentle look
, is an amazing humbert
. he ' s droll in a very unique way
,
and
, well
, no one can look distraught the way he does
. he brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos
and really comes up as bieng easy to identify with the audience
.
and when he looks at lolita with love
,
and she looks at him with lust
, you know that he ' s her prisoner for as long as he lives
.
and dominique swain
, who plays the title character
, is rether incredible
. she pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original
, wonderfully balancing the qualities of siduction
, bratiness
,
and self
- centeredness that marks the character
. it ' s easy to see why she surrenders to humbert
: she loves the attention
,
and knows that she can haev her way with him at any time
. when he denies her something
, she blackmails him effortlessly
( a scene involving a rocking chair
and a little foot action is damn near classic
)
,
and when he stands up to her
, she weeps
and runs away
, leaving humbert to follow her
. there are two other minor characters in the film
, one who ' s a road block in the beginning
,
and the otehr who ' s a reappearing threat to the relationship
. thte former is charlotte
, lolita ' s mother
, played by melanie griffith
. in the book
, charlotte is a monster of a woman
: overbearing
, constantly scolding her child
, overly
- religious
,
and ultimately selfish
.
and she ' s the one obstacal humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal
, at least in the beginning
. as played by shelly winters in the original
, she represented all these qualities
; as played by griffith here
, she ' s about half of them
. it ' s annoying to watch a film
and play a game where you try to see who sould have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them frist
.
and even
though griffith is not really bad
, persay
, she ' s nothing more
. the other is clare quilty
, the writer who is also trying to seduce lolita
,
and succeeds
,
but at a price
. langella takes a totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original
. quilty ws a comic character in the original
: a threat in thge form of many forms
, popping in states of rambling
, german
, proning
,
and eventially drunk
. langella takes the other route
, allowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed
,
adn the result isnt a character who exists inwhich shadows
and low shots
,
and who meets a wonderfully ironic ending
, the excact opposite of what we thought ofthe him
. as you can see
, most of these are not improvements or mistakes done onthe the part ofthe lyne
and his screenwriter
, stephen schiff
,
but just parts of a whole new look at the novel
, at least cinema
- wise
. this version isnt beautiful
,
and perpetually saddening
. the camera movements are stylized
,
annd each shot is breathtakingly rich
. the acting is for the most part wonderful
,
and when we watch it
, we really get a sense that for humbert
, who is telling the story
, the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert
and lolita
. more importantly
, it takes us right up thte brink of emotion
,
then jumps right over it
. by the end
, with humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car
, following what he says is the only part of his life he doesn ' t regret
, we feel that we all lose to something we can never ahve
.
