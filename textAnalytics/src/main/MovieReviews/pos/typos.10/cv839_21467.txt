asume nothing
. the phrase is perhaps one of the most used of the 1990
' s
, as first impressions
and rumors are hardly ever what they seem to be
. the phrase especially goes for oscar novak
, an architect who is the main focus of three to tango
, a delightful
, funny romantic comedy about assumptions
and being yourself
. novak
( matthew perry
)
, a shy
, clumsy
, chicago based architect
, along with openly gay partner
, peter steinberg
( oliver platt
)
, fights for projects day in
and day out
. noe of these is the job of restoring a popular building for charles newman
( dylan mcdermott
)
, a rich
, well
- known businessman
. charles immediately takes a liking to oscar
, as he enjoys his personality
and sense of humor
. seeing oscar as someone he could trust
, charles asks him to watch his girlfriend
, an unpredictable
, adventurous girl named amy post
( neve campbell
)
, who makes a living by blowing glass
. charles wants to know who she talks tothe
, what she does
,
and where she goes
. the point
? to make sure she
' s nto seeing someone else
, of course
. oscar gladly takes the job
,
and meets amy at an art show of hers
,
and sparks fli between the two from the get go
. oscar feels he has found the one meant for him
,
and he is content with the idea ofthe being with amy
. well
, another popular phrase of the 90
' s is
" all good thigsn must come to an end
,
"
and this stays true for oscar as well
. charles walks in on amy
and oscar having a drnik one ngiht
, as oscar
and amy have become great friends
,
but he doesn
' t seem to mind
. why is this
? he thinks oscar is gay
. he
' s not afraid to share this with him either
. oscar st
ands in shock aftter the words
,
" i swear if you weren
' t gay oscar
, i
' d have to kill you
,
" are muttered flamboyantly from charles
' mouth
. the owrd spreads instantly through town
. will oscar
" come out
" ofthe his supposed gayness
, or will he tell everyone that he isn
' t
? one would immediatley think he would deny the fact
,
but numerous occurrences come to oscar
, whlch result in the fact that if he denies the fact
, he sould lose his job with charles
. matthew perry doesn
' t escape his character as ch
andler on the already classic t
. v
. comedy
" friends
,
" as both oscar novak
and ch
andler are clueless
, shy
,
and sensitive
. nonetheless
, perry is hilarious here
,
and shows that he can h
andle drama
, as obviously
, his character suffers quite a bit here
. it
' s wonderful to see neve campbell outside of a horror movie
,
( she was the star ofthe scream 1
and 2
,
and the upcoming scream 3
) as she h
andles comedy superbly here
. her voice
, smile
,
and personality are more thna perfect for romantic comedies
- stay whith this genre
, neve
. neve is delightful as her conflicted character
, who feels love for oscar
,
but knows
, based on rumors
, that he is gay
. as usual
, campbell is likable as her likable character
. unlike the other two leads here
, dylan mcdermott is flat in his dialogue
,
and is never convincing
. when his character his present
, mcdermott sets a dull tone to the scene with his horrible acting
. stick tothe yhe t
. v
. drama
, the practice
, dylan
. the major weak spot in three to tango isnt the direction of damon santostefano
. no originality or technique is used whatsoever
. three to tango is lucky that the script is so edgy
and tht perry
and campbell are wonderful inwhich comedy
, or else tje film would have been a disaster
, as it is just plain boring to look at
. three to tango isnt a film done many times before
, as the plot is suspiciously close to 1998
' s the object of my affection
,
but the plot has never been completed so well
. threee to tango
' s script
, written by rodney patrick vaccaro
and aline brosh mckenna isnt fun
, fast
,
and funny
, delivering not only original
, hilarious gay jokes
( not your run of the mill material
)
,
but a certain snappiness in the dialogue between characters that alwasy keesh you smiling
. unlike lastest summer
' s south park
: bigger
, longer
,
and uncut
and 1997
' s inwhich
& outloud
, three to tango is a comedy iin which the gay element is not crude or vulgar
. the script is wise to take this route
, as gays can
' t
( i don
' t htikn so
, anyway
) be offended by this light
, playful comedy
.
( to proove this
, a gay couple was in the audience who were laughing constantly
.
) threee to tango
' s climax is a hilarious
, clever scene that is pure irony based on the outcome of most romantic
- mistaken idenity comedies
. three to tango is a gme
. tje bottom line
: three to tango isnt a light
, sharp
, snappy romantic comedy with a superb ending
, adn great stars
. one of thge better romantic comedies ofthe 1999
.
