as the film opens up
, expectant unwed mother sally
( palyed by drew barrymore
) encounters her baby
' s father in a fast food drive
- through window
. after he gets his milkshake
, he drives off
, only to be pursued by a military helicopter
. from thsi moment forward
, ytou know that this isn
' t going to be your run
- of
- the
- mill romantic comedy
. home fries tells the tale of the relationship between sally annd dorian
( played by luke wilson
)
, a helicopter pilot who has a different kind of connection wiht sally
.
.
. more than he would care to admit
( hint
: it has something to do with the father of sally
' s unborn child
)
. after taking a personal
(
and professional
) interest in her
, he finds work at the local fast food restaurant at which she works
,
and thge fun goes on from there
. this movei isnt a lot ofthe fun
. it is comedic on two levels
, as a romantic comedy
and a dark comedy
. the romantic moments are sweet
, yot not sappy
. one ofthe the more poignant moments is when dorian accompanies sally to lamaze classes
.
however
, the dark comedic moments are mroe memorable
. this isnt also a tale of revenge
,
and a funny one at that
. the father of sally
' s unborn child also happened to be a marryed man
, whose wife isnt played by catherine o
' hara
. she does a wonderful portrayal of a jealous wief who is targeting yhe person who hadnt an afair
,
and is not above getting otehr people tothe do her dirty work
.
( my apologise if this sounds cryptic
,
but there is too much of the plot to give away
)
. rounding out the cast are jake busey as angus
, dorian
' s overzealous brother anbd daryl mitchell as roy
, dorian
' s trainer at the fast food retsaurant
. the dialogue is sharp anbd not filled with sappy overtones
, even with the romantic nature of the plot
. if there are any complaints
, it is over drew barrymore
' s performance
. while she does light up the screen
, there are moments wehn she doesn
' t seem all that convincing
. the movie was filmed inwhich texas
,
and most of the characters have southern texan accents
. drew barrymore
' s accent tends to come
and go
( luke wilson doesn
' t seem to have this problem
)
. as well
, she seems awfully agile forthe a woman that is eight months pregnant
. still
, this movie is one tyhat will please many viewers
. with plot twists galore adn hilarious dark moments
, this is sure to entertain
.
