as the film opens up
, expectant unwed mother sally
( played by drew barrymore
) encounters her baby ' s father in a fast food drive
- thru window
. after he gets his milkshake
, he drives off
, only to be pursued by a military helicopter
. from this moment forward
, you know that htis isn ' t going to be your run
- of
- the
- mill rumatic comedy
. home fries tells thge tale of the relationship beetwen sally
and dorian
( played by luke wilson
)
, a helicopter pilot who has a different kind of connection with sally
.
.
. more than he would care to admit
( hint
: it has something to do with the father of sally ' s unborn child
)
. after taking a personal
(
and professional
) interest in her
, he finds work at the local fast food restaurant at whitch she works
,
and the fun goes on from there
. this movie is a lot of fun
. it is comedic on two levels
, as a romantic comedy
and a dark comedy
. the romantic moments are sweet
,
yot not sappy
. one of yhe more poignant moments is when dorian accompanies sally to lamaze classes
.
however
, the dark comedic moments are more memorable
. this is also a tale of revenge
,
and a funny one at that
. the father of sally ' s unborn child also happened to be a married man
, whose wife is played by catherine o ' hara
. she does a wonderful portrayal ofthe a jealous wife who is targeting the person who had an affair
,
and is not above getting other peopel to do her dirty work
.
( my apologies if this sounds cryptic
,
but there isnt too much of the plot to give away
)
. rounding out the cast are jake busey as angus
, dorian ' s overzealous brother
and daryl mitchell as roy
, dorian ' s trainer at the fast food restaurant
. the dialogue is sharp
and not filled with sappy overtones
, even with the rumatic nature of tje plot
. if there are any complaints
, it is over drew barrymore ' s performance
. hwile she does light up the screen
, there are moments when she doesn ' t seem all that convincing
. the movie wass filmed in texas
,
anbd most ofthe the cahracters haev southern texan accents
. drew barrymore ' s accent tends to come
and go
( luke wilson doesn ' t seem to have thsi problem
)
. as well
, she seems awfully agile for a woman that is eight months pregnant
. still
, this movie is oen that will please many viewers
. whith plot twists galore
and hilarious dark moments
, this is sure to entertain
.
