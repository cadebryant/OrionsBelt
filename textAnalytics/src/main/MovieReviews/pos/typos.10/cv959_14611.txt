an entertaining 2 horus awaits the audience in this film set inthe the eearly 80
' s
. sevigny
and beckinsale play disco chicks alice
and charlotte
, who are on tjhe lookout for love
. alice is mousy
, shy
, intellectual
, charlotte is bitchy
, out
- going
and fun
. we join their adventures as they go through a variety of adventures
,
and men
, all to the background of the local disco
. whit stillman has both written
and directed an interesting
and believeable sotry
. alice
and charlotte are both well wroten characters
,
and the actresses who play them aren
' t bad aswell
. sevigny delivers an honest performance
,
and makes the audience feel for her character
. beckinsale plays extreme bitch personified
,
yet her character never becomes completely unlikeable
. the huge supporting casted also play a part in making sure this movie is thoroughly entertaining
. the dialogue is sharp
and well written
, with many funny set pieces
. for example
, there
' s a great discussion about lady
& the tramp by the main characters
. the disco tunes playing in the background also make sure that this admittedly long film is good fun
. the direction is good
, bringing out the drama
and comedy in hte scenes
. bu their are slight flaws with thge movei
. firstly
,
al
though it is supposedly set in the 80
' s
, the characters are very
, very 90
' s
. the way they dress
and act have a very 90
' s efel to them
.
al
though tyhe male hairstyles look slightly 80
' s
, frankly the 80
' s atmosphere just wasn
' t conveyed
, which is a shame
. also
, as mentioned above
, the film is too long
,
and some parts do lag
. the charm of the charactors do help these moments
,
but generally the editing could of been a bit tighter
. the plot also side
- tracks into a silly cocaine dealing bust
, which seemed out ofthe place in this movie
. finally
, their are almost too many characters in hte film
,
and despite the running time
, the film never really spends enough time on them
. some of the characters are very slight
, which is a shame
. the conclusion
, while funny
, is also surprisingly weak
,
and certainly not strong enough
.
but despite these qualms
, the last days of disco is a funny
, warm movei
, which is certainly worth seing
,
and is a fitting homage to the disco era ofthe the 80
' s
. worth a look
. overall rating
