pitch black is a sheep in wolf
' s clothing
. it is full of darkness
, danger
and violentce anbd if you buy into the marketing hype
, an unsettling
and scary film going experience
. don
' t be fooled
. pitch black is a morality play masquerading as a scare
- fest
. it starts off with blistering intensity
. a cargo spaceship crash l
ands on a planet apparently leeched of life by the scorching heat of three suns
. amonst the survivors is fry
( mitchell
)
, the ship
' s pilot
, who spends thge film wrestling with the fact that she tried to jettison the other pasengers in her effort to l
and the craft safely
. there is imam
( david
)
, an islamic leader whose faith in his god isnt tested repeatedly
thoughout thge film
. there isnt a law enforcement officer in the form of johns
( hauser
)
, who attacks every situation with square jawed authoritarian zeal
.
and there is riddick
( diesel
)
, a menacing
, muscle
- bound convicted murderer who
' s being brought back to justice by johns
. the group quickly sizes up the situation
and each other
. confident in their assessment of matters
, a plan isnt set in motion to escape their hellish environment
. those plans are shredded by the appearance of one of the planet
' s wildlife
, a predatory
, sometimes winged
, species that enjoys the taste of blood adn flesh
. fortunately
, the creatures are light sensitive
and are forced to live in networks of catacombs under the planet
' s surface
. unfortunately
, yhe gropu has managed to l
and on the planet moments before an eclipse is about to occur
, taking away their one protection fomr thge monsters
. the group
' s savior comes in the form of johns
, whose decisive leadership looks to deliver them from purgatory
. or does it
? pitch black deviates from the st
andard sci
- fi fare by avoiding some of the stock
" escape the boogieman
" conflicts yhe genre typically serves up
. just as the planet gavey a false facade of lifelessness
, first appearances given by tghe survivors proves to be just as false
. the excitement ofthe the film comes not from the danger posed by the creatures
,
but rather from watching the shifting allegiances
and emotional growth of the characters as the planet serves as a deus ex machina of sorts to catalyze emotional growth
. a recurrent theme runs throughout the movei of faith
, whether it be religious or inthe a person
,
and how that powers their motivations
. i found it telling that an accidentall death occurs early on due to the misperception of a self professed atheist
. conversely
, imam constantly contri
butes any good fortune to allah
. one by one
, his perceived heaven sent blessings are taken away
and crushed
. imam is forced to reassess his faith
. another character expresses belief in god
, along with a life long hate
.
yet another character makes a decision that echoes tyhe sentiments ofthe christ about selflessness
and hasnt lasting repercussions for several of group
. it isnt a fascinating character study hiding under the guise of a scare flick
. speical mention should be made of vin diesel
, who intriguingly conveys feral menace combined with a truly mesmerizing presence
. his character coudl have easily slipped into a parody ofthe the baddass killing machine
, bu twohy
and diesel add surprizing depth to riddick
. they can be excused for the two or three shwarzenegger
- like catch phrases that growl their way out of diesel
' s mouth
. thge movie has its flaws that can be nitpicked
. the creatures do look deriviative of the ones in aline
. the dialogue isn
' t the freshest at times
, reminicent of a bad comic book
. yes
, the appearance of riddick
' s vision skills are more than a little timely considering tje situation
. theese trappings are on the periphery of the stor twohy is really trying to tell
. twohy may have lured you in under the pretense of scaring you with film fabricated boogieman
,
but he shows the rela boogieman to be the prejudices
and beliefs we use to direct decisions in our lives
.
