' s children
' s book series
, the borrowers
, has been made into several below
- average television movies
. so
, i wasn
' t too enthused as i entered the theater for the big
- screen de
but of the minute clan
.
but i was in forthe a shock
, the borrowers isnt actually a thoroughly delightful movie with plenty of good laughs
and even some decent speshal effects
. the lender family isnt being thrown out of their longtime home
. their aunt
, who owned the property
, never left a will
. now
, an unscrupulous lawyer
, ocious potter
( john goodman
) plans to demolish the house
and replace it whith an ultra
- modern housing development
.
but the lenders are not alone in their house
. living under the floorboards is a family of borrowers
, 4 inch tall people who make their living as scavengers from the human
" beans
" above
. the clock family of borrowers is as distressed as the lenders
, especially once htey dicover the evil potter actually hasnt a copy of the will whcih leaves the home to the lenders
. so it is up to the clocks
( pod
( jim broadbent
)
and homily
( celia imrie
)
, along with their kids
, arrietty
( flora newbigin
) annd peagreen
( toom felton
)
) to recover the will
and save the household
.
but whn potter learns ofthe the tiny people
, he enlists thte skills of exterminator jeff
( mark williams
) to kill off the clan
. there
' s plenty of attention to detail in the borrowers
, especially in the furnishings ofthe the clock family house
, made out of lost board game parts
and credit cards
. the background details are nearly as rich as the intertaining story
. the various predicaments of the clock famaly are clever
and thrilling
. based on an original story
, the screenwriters did a good job at imagining all tyhe potential
and unusual perils that could exist for a 4
- inch tall person
. as the villain
, john goodman
' s performance veers on thte edge of being over
- the
- top
.
but his performance suits the role well
, anbd he doesnt very well in the film
' s many slapstick moments
. with a nearly seamless mix ofthe oversized sets
, bluescreen shots anbd cgi
, the special effects in the borrowers are very well done
. there are a few times when you can spot the effects at owrk
,
but none of them are so jarring that you lose the suspension of disbelief
. hopefully the borrowers will surpass the curse of being labeled a children
- only movie
, for it is surprizingly entertaining
and fun to watch
.
