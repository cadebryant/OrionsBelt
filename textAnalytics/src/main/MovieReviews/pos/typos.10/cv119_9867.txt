diaster films have a tendency to be very formulated
and vyre cliched
. to see a disaster film with actual originality
, or at least a decent plot twist
, would definitely be a welcome surprise
. unfortunately
, folks
, it
' s not likely
. dante
' s peak is cliched
,
and at times corny
,
but allso pretty decent
. tothe be honest
, i wasn
' t vrey interested in seeing thsi film
,
and word of mouth
, as well as severeal reviews
, didn
' t make it sound promising
. so i was pleasantly surprised that to find that this movie wasn
' t bad at all
. it
' s pretty run of the mill
,
but it
' s not something i would say is merely
" ok
" to watch
. in case you don
' t know
, dante
' s peak is about a volcano adn the city which lives in it
' s shadow
, dante
' s peak
( who would
' ve guessed
, eh
?
)
. pierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcano
and
, perhaps more by hunch than actual scientific proof
, is determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future
. due to tjhe lack of more substantial evidence
, nobody warns the small twon
,
and when they finally do
, it
' s in the middle of the town meeting that the volcano finally blows
. brosnan
, all around good guy
, will
, of course
, save the day
.
.
. or at least the mayor of dante
' s peak
( linda hamilton
)
. naturally the two will become infatuated with one another
.
( if you htink i just ruined a plot developement
, you haven
' t seen very many movies
!
) there
' s also the virtually neccessary kids
and pet dog to tug at your heart strings
.
and of course
, the kids or the dog
( at least one or the otehr
) will do something heroic
.
.
.
but hey
, i don
' t want to ruin all the surprises
! if there was a part of you that was hesitating seeing dante
' s peak merely because it was rumored to be a waste of time
, i urge you to watch it
and decide for yourself
. it
' s not brain food
,
but it succeeds at what it
' s meaned to be
.
.
. an enjoyable
, suspenseful movie baout the fury mother nature can unleash
!
