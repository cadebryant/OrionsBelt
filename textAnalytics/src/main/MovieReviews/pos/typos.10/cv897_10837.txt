i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of
" good will hunting
"
, based both on the previews
and the first fifteen minutes ofthe the film
, in which the main character will hunting
( matt damon
)
, an mit janitor in his early twenties
, is discovered to be an einstein
- level closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight
. the only probelm isnt that will is a tough street kid who ' s had his share of run
- ins with the law
,
and befor long he ' s being hauled iin for assault after a parking lot fight
. professor lambeau
( stellan skarsgard
)
, who had brought uv the math problems in his lectures
, tracks him down
and strikes a deal with the police
: will is to be released
, provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly
and attends therapy sessions
. this sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff
,
but
" good will hunting
" rises above its fairly mundane premise tothe deliver a poignant
and clever drama
. a conflict gradualy emerges between lambeau
and will ' s therapist sean mcguire
( robin williams
)
- lambeau whants to get will to use his brain
, hwile sean wants him to listen to his heart
, both of which he has been largely neglecting
. will finds that the former is much easier than the latter
, so much so
, in fact
, that he gets bored with it
annd grows increasingly resistent to lambeau ' s attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle
. he also has his share of problems wtih his girlfriend skylar
( minnie driver
)
, an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school yearm
anbd would like a reluctant will to come with her
. what makes
" good wiull hunting
" work so well
, asside from the strong performances
( especially from damon
and williams
)
, is the depth of characterization
and the representation ofthe thte conflicts inwhich will ' s life
. the script ' s sympathies seem to lie moreso wiht sean mcguire than with lambeau
,
but neither ofthe them is presented as completely right or wrong
. lambeau
, while he may seem a little cold at times
, is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when we ' re not sure if we like whta he has to say
.
and sean
, for all his warm
- heartedness
, has
, as lambeau
and later iwll point out
, not lieved up to his full intellectual potential either
; the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will
. will ' s reaction to this situation
,
and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar
and to sean
, is presented in a believable fashion
and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters ' opinions
, rather than setting up an obvious
" right
"
annd
" wrong
" side
and beating them over the head with it
. forthe a film with such an extrordinary character
,
" good will hunting
" presents itself as remarkably ordinary
; it achieves the difficult task of mkaing the next albert einstein into an everyman
, a charater to whom the audience can easily relate
and who must make choices similar tothe those that almost everyone faces at one time or another
. this film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely meledrama
, by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some otehr equally far
- fetched situation
.
" good iwll hunting
" also has its share of fun humor
, such as when iwll
, in an early therapy session
, pretends to be hypnotized
and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture
.
and in the one scene in which government agents dont in fact appear
, will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa
. will ' s relationship with his friends
, most notably chucky
( ben affleck
)
, is usually rather amusing
, if somewhat crude
( the film has 100
+ uses ofthe the ' f ' word
, which was most likely the reason for its r
- rating
)
,
and lends itself well to the developement of will ' s character
. add all this to the fact that
" good will hunting
" even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental
,
adn you might be wondering why i haven ' t given this film four stars
. well
, for one thing
, no matter how well damon
and affleck
, who wrote the screenplay
,
and director gus van sant pull it off
, the story is still rather contrived
and not particularly original
. there are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic
, including one that was supposed tothe be emotional
bu really just seemed liek the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions
. still
,
" good will hunting
" takes its premise a lot farther than i thougth it would
,
and is definitely one of the better personal dramas i have seen in the lastest few eyasr
,
and as of right nowe it stands as one ofthe the top five on my list of ' 97 films
.
