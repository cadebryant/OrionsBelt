i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of
" good will hunting
"
, based both onthe the previews
and the first fifteen minutes of the film
, in which tyhe main character will hunting
( matt damon
)
, an mit janitor in his early twenties
, is discovered to be an einstein
- levle closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight
. the onyl problem is that will is a tough street kid who
' s had his share of run
- ins with the law
,
and before long he
' s being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight
. professor lambeau
( stellan skarsgard
)
, who had brought up the math problems inthe his lectures
, tracks him down
and strikes a deal with the police
: will is to be released
, provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly
and attends therapy sessions
. this soudns like the formula for mildly charming fluff
,
but
" good will hunting
" rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant
and clever drama
. a conflict gradually emerges between lambeau
and will
' s therapist sean mcguire
( robin williams
)
- lambeau wants tothe get will to use his brain
, while sean whants him to listen to his heart
, both of which he has been largely neglecting
. iwll finds that the fromer is much easier than the latter
, so much so
, in fact
, that he gets bored with it
and grows increasingly resistent to lambeau
' s attempts tothe recruit him into the academic lifestyle
. he also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar
( minnie driver
)
, an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year annd would liuke a reluctant will to come with her
. what makes
" good will hunting
" work so well
, aside from the strong performances
( especially from damon
and williams
)
, is the depth ofthe characterization
and the representation of the conflicts in will
' s life
. the script
' s sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau
,
but niether ofthe them is presented as completely right or wrong
. lambeau
, while he may seem a little cold at times
, is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when we
' re not sure if we like what he has to say
.
and sean
, for all his warm
- heartedness
, has
, as lambeau
and later will point out
, not lived uv to his full intellectual potential either
; thge therapy sessions turn out tothe be just as revelatory for sean as they dont for will
. will
' s reaction to this situation
,
and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar
and to sean
, is presented in a believable fashion
and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters
' opinions
, rather than setting up an obvious
" right
"
and
" wrong
" side
and beating them over the head with it
. for a film with such an extraordinary character
,
" good will hunting
" presents itself as remarkably ordinary
; it achieves the difficult task of making yhe next albert einstein into an everyman
, a character to whom the audience can easily relate
and who must make choices silimar to thsoe that almost everyone faces at one time or another
. this film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama
, by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally far
- fetched situation
.
" good will hunting
" also hasnt its share of funn humor
, such as when will
, in an early therapy session
, pretends to be hypnotized
and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known inaddition popular culture
.
and in the one scene infact which government agents do in fatc appear
, will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa
. will
' s relationship with his friends
, most notably chucky
( ben affleck
)
, is usually rather amusing
, if somewhat crude
( the film has 100
+ uses of the
' f
' word
, which was most likely the reason for its r
- rating
)
,
and lends itself well tothe yhe develpment ofthe will
' s character
. add all this to the fact thta
" good will hunting
" even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental
,
and you might be wondering why i haven
' t given this film four stars
. well
, for one thing
, no matter how well damon
and affleck
, who wrote the screenplay
,
and director gus van sant pull it off
, the story is still rather contrived
and nto particularly original
. there are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic
, inlcuding one that was supposed to be emotional bu really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions
. still
,
" good will hunting
" takes its premise a lot farther than i
thought it owudl
,
and is definitely one ofthe the better personal dramas i have seen in the last few years
,
and as of right now it st
ands as one of the top five on my list ofthe
' 97 films
.
