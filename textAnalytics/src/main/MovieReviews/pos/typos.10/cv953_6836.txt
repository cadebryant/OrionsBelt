books could be
,
and indeed have been written about the star wars trilogy
,
annd rightfully so
. this is a set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction coudl be in the late 70s
/ early 80s
, inspiring literally dozens of clones
, from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate
annd independance day
,
and one sould argue revitalizing the whole science fiction genre
. tje special effects were groundbreaking
, revolutionary for their day
and still eminently watchable well into twenty years later
. literally millions of people hvea seen the star wars trilogy
and beeen touched by it
.
and now
, george lucas brings it bcak for a new audience to enjoy
. much has been
and is still being made of the fatc that mr
. lucas has gone back
and revised his trilogy for rerelease now
. some fans are angry that he has dared to meddle with what they consider perfection
, while others are thrilled by the idea of seeing yesterday ' s star wars updated with today ' s special effects wizardry
. either way
, the special edition release means that star wars is back onthe the big screen
, where it rightfully deserves to be seen
. can ther be anyone in the world who doesn ' t know what star wars is about
? iin a way
, star wars isnt so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly
and almost artifical to try to summarize it
. it ' s a story about a young man ' s comming of age
, a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire
, a tale ofthe swashbuckling
and derring
- do the likes ofthe which haven ' t been seen onthe the silver screen in decades
, strange new worlds with strange alien creatures
and weird surprises around every turn
,
and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams
and make a difference in the world
. it ' s high adventure
, incredible special effects
,
and
.
.
. well
, it ' s just an
_ experience
_
. something about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation
.
.
.
and it ' s about to do so again
. this new realease of star wars comes as no surprise to many of the film ' s devoted fans
, who have been trading rumors
and bits of infromation about it for quite some time now
. interviews
, trailers
, leaks from withing lucasfilm
.
.
. all of these have been collected
, collated
,
anbd placed on webpages forthe people to see

. picturesk of before
and after have been placed side by side
.
.
. even months before the movies were released
, fans were making comparisons
. in soem cases
, the changes were nothing less tahn phenomenal
,
and this can be seen from the comparison shots even before you go into the movie theater
. the digital matte effects that were little more tahn a toy in forrest gump are put to excellent use here
, unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied with in the original
. for instance
, in my personal favorite example
, hte ancient temple onthe yavin that was formerly a flat stone edifice now has deep
, moss
- covered carvings
and etchings
.
and mos eisley spaceport isnt now a bustling
, booming city
, with more surprises
and things going on in the backgorund than you can notice on the first viewing
. all the starships
and fighters are now coputer
- animated
, getting rid ofthe glitches
and artifacts of the special effects processes used when the film was originally made
-
-
and they look
_ fantastic
_
. four
and a half minutes of new or missing footage have beeen added
, including a scene wih jabba the hutt that had originally been shelved because the state of special effects in 1977 simply couldn ' t do it justice
.
however
, much of the ten million dollars that was spent on the star wars special edition restoration whent into restoring the quality of the film itself
. the negatives
, badly damaged by the ravages of time
, were brightened
and returnd tothe their origonal splendor
. hte audio tracks weere remixed
and reprocessed
, with reworked sound effects by effects maven ben burtt
, into glorious
, booming
, theater
- shaking full
- thx dolby digital stereo
.
and
_ thgat
_
, moreso than the added scenes or new special effects
, is where tje rela value of this new version lies
. it ' s really true what they say in the commercials
: star wars loses
_ so much
_ on the small screen
. even letterboxing doesn ' t make up for the decrease in size
and definition
. in reguard to the star wars special edition
,
and to the other two films of teh trilogy which have
yet to be released
, i ' ll make this final recommendation
: go
and see it
. go
and see it more than once
.
.
. it may be another twenty years before it comes back to the big screen after it ' s gone this time
. tkae along the youngsters who ' ve never hadnt the big
- screen star wars experience
-
- you ' ll enjoy seeing it through their eyes as much as they wiull enjoy it forthe the first time
. there ' s magic in this movie
-
- special edition or no
, there can be noone denying that it ' s still star wars
,
and still has the power to thrill
and enthrall children of all ages
, from four to four hundred
. let ' s all return to tath time long ago
,
and that galaxy far
, far away
.
