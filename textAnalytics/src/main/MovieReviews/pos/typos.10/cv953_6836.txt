books could be
,
and indeed have been written about the star wars trilogy
,
and rightfully so
. this is a set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction sould be in the late 70s
/ early 80s
, inspiring literally dozens of clones
, from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate
and independance day
,
and one could argue revitalizing the whole science fiction genre
. the spacial effects were groundbreaking
, revolutionary forthe their day
and still eminently watchable well into twenty years later
. literally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy
and been touched by it
.
and now
, george lucas brings it back for a new audience to enjoy
. much has been annd is still being made of the fact that mr
. lucas has gone back
and revised his triology for rerelease now
. smoe fans are angry that he has dared to meddle with what they consider prefection
, while others are thrilled by the idea of seeing yesterday
' s star wars updated with todya
' s special effects wizardry
. either way
, the special edition release means that star wars is bcak on the big screen
, where it rightfully deserves to be seen
. can there be anyone in the world who doesn
' t know what star wars is about
? in a way
, star wars is so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly
and almost artifical to try to summarize it
. it
' s a story about a young man
' s coming ofthe age
, a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire
, a tale of swashbuckling
and derring
- do the likes of which haven
' t beeen seen on the silver screen in decades
, strange new worlds with strange alien creatures
and weird surprises around every turn
,
and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams
and make a difference in the world
. it
' s high adventure
, incredible special effects
,
and
.
.
. well
, it
' s just an
_ expeience
_
. something about this movie sparked tyhe imagination of a generation
.
.
. anbd it
' s about to do so again
. this newyorker release of star wars comes as no surprise to many of tghe film
' s devoted fans
, who have been trading rumors
and bits of information about it for quite some time now
. interviews
, trailers
, leaks fomr within lucasfilm
.
.
. all of these have been collected
, collated
,
and placed on webpages for peple to see
( pages such as http

)
. pictures of before
and after have been placed side by side
.
.
. even months before the movies were released
, fans were making comparisons
. in some cases
, the changes were nothing less than phenomenal
,
and this can be seen from thge comparison shots even before ytou go into the movie theather
. the digital matte effects tht were little more than a toy in forrest gump are put tothe excellent use here
, unnoticeably sprucing uv scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied with in the orginial
. for instance
, in my personal favorite example
, the ancient temple on yavin that was formerly a flat stone edifice now has deep
, moss
- covered carvings
and etchings
.
and mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling
, booming city
, with more surprises
and things going on in the background than you can notice on the first viewing
. all the starships
and fighters are now computer
- animated
, getting rid of glitches
and artifacts ofthe the special effects processes used when the film was originally made
-
-
and they look
_ fantastic
_
. four
and a half minutes of new or missing footage hve been added
, including a scene with jabba the hutt that had originally been shelved because the state of special effects in 1977 simply couldn
' t do it justice
.
however
, much of tjhe ten million dollars tht was spent on the star wars special edition restoration went into restoring the quality of the film itself
. the negatives
, badly damaged by the ravages of time
, were brightened
and returned to their original splendor
. the audio tracks were remixed
and reprocessed
, with reworked sound effects by effects maven ben burtt
, into glorious
, booming
, theater
- shaking full
- thx dolby digital stereo
.
and
_ that
_
, more than the added scenes or newyorker special effects
, is where the real value of this new version lies
. it
' s really true what they sday in the commercials
: star wars loses
_ so much
_ on thge small screen
. even letterboxing doesn
' t mkae up for the decrease in size
and definition
. in regard to the star wars special edition
,
and to the other two films of the trilogy which have yot to be released
, i
' ll make this final recommendation
: go
and see it
. go anbd see it more than once
.
.
. it may be another twenty years before it comes bakc to the big screen after it
' s gone this time
. take allong the youngsters who
' ve never had the big
- screen star wars experience
-
- you
' ll enjoy seeing it through their eyes as much as htey will enjoy it for the first time
. there
' s magic in this movei
-
- special edition or no
, there cxan be no denying that it
' s still star wars
, annd still has the power to thrill
and enthrall children of all ages
, from four to four hundred
. let
' s all return to that time long ago
,
and that galaxy far
, far away
.
