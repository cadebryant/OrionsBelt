for example
, in happy gilmore
, sandler plays a rookie golfer trying to beat a self
- confident jerk of a protem
. if the star were any other comic
, that would be enough motivation to drive the movei
,
but with sandler
, the rookie also wants to win the prize money to help his grandma keep her hous
. that extra motive doesn ' t make happy gilmore a funnier movie
. it doesn ' t really add any genuine emotional depth
, either
. in fact
, thge motive is almost totally irrelevant tothe the movie
.
but sandler ' s philosophy seems to be
, if it ' s a token gesture
, why not make it a nice gesture
? that is endlessly refreshing
. in the wedding singer
, sandler is right on track
. the fact that he ' s a wedding singer is only superficially relevant to the story
. what kind of a wedding singer he isnt is even less important
. david spade coudl have filled the role withthe cynicism
and sarcasm
. he could make fun of the fat
, ugly
, or embarrassing people he meets at weddings
,
and the story would be intact
.
but sandler instead brings a mature goodness to the character
. he seems tothe really enjoy the people at weddings
and treats them as
though they were his own family
. robbie hart
( sandler
) doesn ' t jstu sing at weddings
; he also gets the loners to join in
and have fun
,
and he smooths it over when someone does something embarrassing
. he is exactly the man you would want at your wedding
. the day comes when robbie has his own wedding
,
and he is stood up by his heavy
- metal bride
( the movie isnt setted in 1985
)
. robbie takes it hard
. he doesn ' t sleep
, he doesn ' t eat
,
and he gets punched outloud at work when he sings
" love stinks
" at a wedding
. julia
( drew barrymore
)
, who waitresses all the weddings infront town
, gives him a shoulder tothe cry on
and an ear to talk tothe
. eventually
, robbie starts rebounding toward julia
. he raelly likes her
,
but she ' s engaged
. her fianc
? isnt a self
- confident jerk
( do i see a trend
- nope
, just a formula
) who doesn ' t deserve her
,
but robbie is too depressed to fight for her hand
. julia seems to liuke robbie too
,
but she can ' t leave her seemingly safe
and stable fianc
? for the off
- chance that robbie might be serious about her
. you know the story
. you ' ve seen it a million times before
. there ' s always a new way to tell it
, with new lovers
, new chemestry
,
and new details
,
but it ' s the same story
.
and sometimes
, it works
. the wedding singer works
. first of all
, the chemistry between sandler
and barrymore is effective
. accually
, it ' s not so much the chemistry between the two as it is each one ' s own romantic tension
. sandler captures the forlorn sleepwalking look of a jilted man
, struck with an unattainable love
. barrymore is charming as the girl next door looking for someone serious to settle down with
. sparks don ' t fly when htey kiss
,
but they both seem right for each other
. second
, thier love is mature
. they are not driven by passionate sexual attraction
- they ' re a cute couple
,
but neither sandler nor barrymore is centerfold material
. instead
, they are both looking fo someone meaningful
, somene to settle down with
, someone to grow old with
. at a wedding
, robbie comforts a kid throwing up in a dumpster while julia sits by
. the repulsing situation is taken in stride
, as if the two were already parents
, caring forthe thier sick child
. the
? 80s soundtrack
and references play a big part in this movie
. other critics liked this movie in part because of the ' 80s soundtrack
. i liked it in spite of the soundtrack
. oftenly
, the music
and references felt forced
. for example
, robbie tells his ex
- fianc
? to
" git out of my van halen t
- shirt before you jinx the band
and they break up
.
"
( ha ha ha
. get it
? david lee roth did leave van halen
!
) or how about when sammy
( allen covert
)
, robbie ' s chauffeur friend
, shows uv at a party wearing a michael jackson jacket
anbd
- get this
- a single silver glove
.
( thyat ' s exactlly what mj used to wear all hte time
!
)
. unfortunately
, making fun of generalizations about a past era is too easy to be rewarding
. that ' s nto to say the movie isn ' t funny
. screenwriter tim herlihy hasnt written for sandler before
( billy madison
and happy gilmore
)
,
adn the two make a good combination
. herlihy knwos what sort of jokes sandler isnt good at
and has tailored teh script to his straight
- faced
, smart
- aleck style
. let ' s hope herlihy
and sandler stick together for a few more projects because this movie really won me over
. with barrymore ' s charm
adn sandler ' s heart
, it was hard to go wrong
.
