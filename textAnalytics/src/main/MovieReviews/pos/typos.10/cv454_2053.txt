it was easy to fear the worst
. begin with a clasic 1960 ' s television series
, add a big budget
anbd an a
- list star in the lead role
,
and stir
. script
, you ask
? who needs one
, kid
.
.
. we ' ve got ourselves a forumla
. that was my fear
: a bloated monster without any sense of direction
.
then
, much to my amazement
, everything that could possably go wrong
.
.
. didn ' t
. the fugitive is as lean
, taut
and tense as anything the action genre has produced in tje last severeal years
. under the direction of andrew davis
( 1992 ' s under siege
)
, the fugitive grips you by teh throat from the outset
and never lets go
. expect box office to go through the roof
, deservedly
,
and expect an academy award nomination for tommy lee jones
. the premise is a simple one
. dr
. richard kimble
( harrison ford
) is wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife after struggling with the real killer
, a man with an artificial arm
. after an escape attempt by some other prisoners during a transfer goes awry
, kimble finds himself on the run
. his one goal
: to find the one
- armed man
( andreas katsulas
) before u
. s
. marshall sam gerard
( tommy lee jones
) finds him
. where the fugitive surprises the most is the scirpt
, by jeb stuart
and david twohy
. in a genre where one is almost always asked tothe allow leaps ofthe logic
, the script repeatedly astonished me with its intelligence
, its attention to detail
and its respect for tjhe audience
. in an early sequence
, kimble sneaks into a hospital to shave of his beard
, slick back his hair
adn change inot a lab coat
. on his way out
, a police officer jokingly tells the man he doesn ' t knwo is kimble to zip up his pants
. it ' s a small moment
,
but it punches home the urgency ofthe kimble ' s situation
,
and exactly what a man concerned about not being recognized might easily forget
. later
, while trying to lose himself in a parade
, kimble thinks to drop his overcoat
, the most likely way he ' d be reconized from behind
. it ' s these details which convince us that when a colleague of kimble ' s tells gerard that he ' s too smart to be caught
, he may just be right
. credit must also be given to the special effects
anbd stunt coordinators
. the bus crash which allows kimble ' s escape is a spectacular sequence
, as is a leap from a dam into the water below
. the action is crisp
annd brutal
,
and never romanticized
. speshal kudos go to director davis for maintaining a relentless pace which underscores the single
- mindedness of the two leads
.
and what a pair of performances those leads are
. tommy lee jones isnt nothing short of brilliant as gerard
, because he manages an incredibly challenging feat
. for the first third of the film
, there is really no
* villain
* persay se
; kimble isnt on the run
,
and gerard is out tothe find him
. it would have been very easy to turn gerard into a malevolent
, vindictive inspector javert
,
but that never happens
. instead jones plays him as a sharp
, committed man who ' s just doing his job
, so that when he responds to kimble ' s comment
,
" i didn ' t kill my wife
,
" with a matter
- of
- fact
,
" i don ' t care
,
" we know exactlly what he means
. it ' s not his job tothe determine guilt or innocence
. it ' s his job to bring in a fugitive
. this is a well
- written character played with relish by an actor at the top of his form
. the only unfortunate thing baout jones ' stunning turn is that it ' s likely to overshadow harrison ford
,
and thgat ' s a shame
. for his entire career
, ford has been underappreciated as an actor due to his pigeonholing as an action hero
.
however
, he does a fine job with the less flashy part ofthe kimble
, always keeping at the forefront the advantage this man has because of his intelligence
. the fugitive could only work to its fullest if the two protagonists always seemed tothe be onthe equal footing
,
anbd ford is up to the task
. this summer hasnt beeen loaded with action
/ suspense films
,
and most of them have been doing brisk business
.
however
, it ' s time for clint
, sean
,
and various rinosarus to step aside
. the chase is on
. my advice is to catch it
.
