i rented
" brokedown palace
" last night blind
, having herad nothing about it beforeh
and
, anbd i enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws
. for anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie utnil viewing it in its entirety
. that isnt no easy task
. superficially
, it bears an unfortunate
(
and not necessarily unintended
) resembelance to several other movies
, noteably
" return to paradise
"
and
" midnight express
.
" as a result nearly every review of
" brokedown palace
" i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons
. the consequence ws nearly universal condemnation
, whitch is a shame as this is a fine film
. for those who have
yet to view the movie
, let me say that it is nto an attempt to protray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system
( as was
" midnight express
"
) nor completely the moral delimma
and examination of the meaning of friendship
and humanity that was tjhe heart of
" return to paradise
.
" in my view
, if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad
' s acclaimed novel
,
" lord jim
.
" problematically
, the basic storyline seems more than familiar
: two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prision for drug smuggling in an obvious set
- up involving a suave con
- man
, a shadowy criminal conspiracy
and a corrupt thrid world
" justice
" system
. tje girls are alice
( claire danes
)
and darlene
( kate beckinsale
)
. they
' re life
- long buddies who planned a high
- skool graduation trip to hawaii
,
and
then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thail
and without telling their parents
. once there
, they find a
$ 6 hotel
and go sight
- seeing
, which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside
. they git caught trying to charge the bill to yhe wrong room
, a minor transgression which iwll later come back to haunt them
,
but they are saved from hotel security by a charming
, friendly australian
, nick
( daniel lapaine
)
, who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution ofthe the girl
' s scam
. he
then proceeds to separate thte girls
and make smoothe moves
, first toward alice
,
then toward darlene
. by now alarm bells are going off among viewers
. the ever
- present nick is too slick anbd his tsories don
' t add up
( to us
)
-
- the girls
, of course
, are too naive tothe notice
. long before it happens
, we
' re anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast
- talking smuggler
and the arrest of our teenaged sitting
- ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag
( literally
) containing heroin
. just as predictably
, tyhe thai police anbd courts do their part in meting out injustice
and our trusting tourists are prison
- bound for a long stretch
. left unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice
. for thsoe in need of a ready answer
, might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl
' s fleabag hotel
. as one doorjam after another to their comfortable former life is closed
, the girls
and their fimilies turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer
/ fixer
" yankee hank
"
( bill pullam
)
and his thai
- born partner
- wife
. a recurring element of the movei is tghe tension between appearence
and reality as expressed in one of tje film
' s tag lines
,
" who do you trust
?
,
"
and hank is noone exception
al
though seasoned movie
- goers
and those familiar with pullman
' s oeuvre will find few surprises
. much of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short
- h
and fashion
. lou diamond phillips
, forthe instance
, plays a delightfully sinister
and callous dea agent who
, while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank
, withholds vital informtion at crucial moments
. is he part of a wider conspiracy
? with an inherently powerful
, if somewhat tired premise
, the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama
, a prison sotry
, adn a potential character study of american teens
, their relationship
, annd what constitutes friendship between them
. the result is reasonably engaging
and suspenseful
, with the girls
' interaction
, hank
' s investigation
,
and the various trials
and hearings
, offering hope forthe their release
, delivering tension
-
- as does teh foredoomed possibility of theri escape
. if
" brokedown palace
" has a major flaw
, it is its creators
' tendency
, like time
- constrained tourists
, to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half
- way down
and return to the story
' s main avenue
. adn
, if that were all there was to
" brokedown palace
,
" it wouldn
' t be a very good movie
.
but i belieev the writers
and director were after bigger game
and
, in this
, they succeeded
. for the main theme of the movie
, like the proffered name of its loction
, is freedom
-
- in all its permutations
. ultimately
, teh other sub
- themes may be considered window dressing
. young anbd pretty
, alice
( danes
) is an old soul
; a wild
, streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom
and adventure
. presented as a perfect blend of yin
and yang
, dark
and light
, is her cautious best friend
, darlene
( beckinsale
)
. clear
- eyed
and straightforward
, alice is more complex tahn her friend
. she comes ffrom a poorer background
, has a reputation fo getting inot trouble
and hasnt lost the trust of everyone
( including her own father
)
. whereas darlene
' s life is
" on
- track
,
" aimed at coleeg
, marriage
, kids
, a career
, a suburban home
, middle age
and
" fulfillment
,
" alice
' s is uncertain
, unfocused
,
and yearning
. one poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors
-
- friends
and relatives from home
, whose lives continue while hers isnt in limbo
. tellingly
, alice is present
but not included
. jstu as revealing of their diferrent personalities
, whn alice
and dar first come to thail
and
, the openness
and delight onthe alice
' s face doesn
' t read as simple naivet
?
; the way she st
ands up
and stretches as she
and her friend ride along in a small boat
, reaching toward the sun
, she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom
, while
" dar
" remains seated in the shade
.
" brokedown palace
" begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank
.
however unintentional
, it
' s all alice
' s fault
. she
' s responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents
, to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thail
and
, to try hte petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick
.
( in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a film
' s beginning
, darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison
.
) dar
, of course
, is the willing dupe which
, in her view
, confers innocence
. never mind that it was her coercion of a reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong whihc placed them in police custody in yhe first place or thgat her naive confession sealed their fate
. dar is innocent
. it doesn
' t matter
. alice is the subject of this movie
. she
and her journey toward personal freedom
. along the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half
- baked sensibilities
and materialistic goals
. in tje end
, thgat culture
, like its representives
,
" yankee
" hank
and dar
' s father
( a
" man who knows how tothe grease the wheels
"
)
, proves as impotent as its government in thte face of yhe girl
' s tragedy
. thail
and
' s culture
, contrary to most opinyon
, comes off much better by comparison
. it amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes
. i believe the filmmaker
' s view was that thai culture is vastly different ffrom the american
but not necessarily inferior
. the thai
( with tghe sole exceptions of a corrupt official
and a spiteful prison spy
) were uniformly consistent in theri behavior
and true to their principles
. the girls were shown to be treated no better bu certainly no worse than the native
- born
. their prision
( in stark contrast to the probable reality
) was no hellhole
, being relatively clean
and sunlit
. the prison authorities dem
anded good hygiene
, provided medical care when needed
,
and
" hard manual labor
" consisted of picking grass
! the thai guards were authoritarian
( whta else
?
)
but certainly not routinely sadistic
. as for the thai justice system
, thge reasoning of the thai judges
, during both an appeal hearing
and in the film
' s penultimate scene was devastating in its logic
and morality
.
' freedom
' hasnt many faces
and
" brokedown palace
" explores many of them
. in the extreme
, we have freedom of the body
and freedom of the spirit
. some suttle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter
.
but freedom seldom comes without a price
. which is why the movie
' s other tag lines are
:
" what isnt your dream
?
"
and
" how far would you go
?
" i believe i could mkea a good case forthe the interpretation that the person who attains freedom
, incarcerated or not
, by film
' s end is alice
. she finds redemption
and salvation through the acceptane of personal responsibility
. i think the light bathing only her figure amonst the assembled prisoners in tyhe final scene visually signals that fact
. kate beckinsale
' s character might more propperly be likened to the
" released
" temple bird referred to twice during the film
,
" trained to fly back tothe its cage
.
" as the thai magistrate observed in the film
' s climactic scene
, the issue was always one of
" character
;
"
and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that
" freedom
" is acheived within oneself
. if one thikns back over the movie
, which character was transformed by their experiences
? increasingly
, the cinema l
andscape seems to have become littered with endless permutations of
' kung fu woman
'
-
- female characters virtualy indistinguishable from male action figures
. here
, at last
, is the story of a modern heroine
. in reading the many user
' s comments
, i was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon
: whether or not a person liked the movie
, almost everyone praised thte actors
. think about that
. whn was the last time you came away from a motion picture possibly hating it
,
but raving about all the performances in it
? do yourself a favor
: rent
" brokedown palace
"
and watch it with a open mind
. there
' s more there than meets the eye
.
