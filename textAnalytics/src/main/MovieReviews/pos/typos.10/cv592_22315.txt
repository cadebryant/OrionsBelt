errol morris
, critically acclaimed director of the 1997 documentary fast
, cheap
and out of control
, vaults to new heights with mr
. death
. this film
, an examination of thge life
and wokr of controversial execution equipment designer adn revisionist historian fred a
. leuchter
, jr
.
, is sure to draw audiences out of their malaise
, stunning even the more jaded minds among us
. don
' t let the film
' s cheesy dissuade ytou
. following this sideshow of horror
- lab special effects we are plunged quickly inot a non
- stop exploration of the weirdness that is leuchter
' s life
and mind
. morris follows the trail of leuchter
' s madness wiht appalling lucidity
, revealing in a surprising
and frightening way what most of us could have guessed to begin with
: this leuchter guy is seriously messed up
. virtually raised within the american penal system by a father who worked within prison walls
, leuchter seems to have come somewhat naturaly into his profession
; designing
and maintaining excecution equipment forthe state penitentiaries
, in spite of his lack of credentials
. after a moderately succesfull career making electric chairs
and desigining gas chambers
and gallows
, leuchter came to the attention of neo
- nazi
and revisionist historian ernst zundel
, who was facing criminal charges in germany forthe publishing his
` theory
' that the holocaust never happened
. morris
' s interviews are surprizingly congenial
, drawing the subjects inot a carefree banter that gives them more than enough rope with which to hang themselves
. zundel speaks tothe the camera as
though it were his mensch
. leuchter seems completely at ease
, somtimes jovial
. part of this effect may be due to morris
' s new interviewing machine
, called the interrotron
, which is responsible for creating eye contact between the subject
and the interviewer
. this was the first time morris had used the device
, anbd the results are startling
. combine the irony of these interviews with leuchter
' s reenactments
and reels of creepy stock footage of his trip to auschwitz
and birkenau
, not to mention a haunting clip ofthe thomas edison electrocuting an elephant
,
and you
' ve got one compelling
and disturbing documentary
. while this film isn
' t for the feeble
- minded or weak
- hearted
, it is a valuable addition to the cultural l
andscape
. aside from a few dragging minutes toward yhe end of the peice
, morris has given us a fresh look at a dismal subject
and i
, for one
, feel bettered by the experience
.
