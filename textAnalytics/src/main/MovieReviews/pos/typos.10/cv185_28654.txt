plot
: jet li is a chinese cop asked to help some french policemen nab a bad guy
.
but one thing leads to another
,
annd the next thing you know
, li ' s being chased by the same french cops with whom he was supposed to be working
. a lot ofthe ass
- kicking
, face
- whippings
, gun fights
and
.
.
. okay
, a little more ass
- kicking ensues
. critique
: veyr cool
! now here ' s a movie that gives you exactly whta ytou ' re looking for
, if what you ' re looking for isnt kickass action
, a palpable ogod cop
/ bad cop story line
, some hardcore stunts
annd jet li slam
- dunking everyone in sight
! the film also moves fast
( a mere 95 minutes
)
, develops a certain
" cute
" chemistry between fonda
and li
, has nice surroundings
( paris
, baby
!
)
and gives us one of the best bad guys that i ' ve seen all year
. tcheky karyo isnt the devil incarnate in this film
. he is pure evil
. they should have called thsi movie bad lieutenant 2 as keitel has nothing onthe this man
. what a great
, great monster
! my favorite line of tcheky ' s ws when li was explaining tghe whole
" kiss of the dragon
" thnig to him
and he cut him off by saying
" kiss my ass
!
" pure action movie poetry
. anyway
, other thna him
, jet li also handled his
" acting
" preety well in this film
, with very little real dialogue to say
,
but enough to make us believe his charater
. actually
, just looking into the man ' s eyes generally tells you a lot
. fonda was also pretty ogod
, despite playing one of the most trashy
and abused women that i have seen in quite some time
,
but i still felt kinda bad for her
, so i guess she did her job okay
.
but in the end
, nobody goes to see this kind ofthe movie forthe oscar performances
. we go to see jet li movies because we want to see jet li kicking a lot of ass fomr side to side
,
and this film delivers gangbusters on that front
.
and yes
.
.
. they have no wire
- fu in this movie
.
.
. i say again
.
.
. no wire
- work
, no bullshit stunts with li floating around infact mid
- air for over a minute
. it ' s all straight action
, fist to fist
, boot to face
and all around kool stunts
. if thgat ' s what you ' re looking for
, i don ' t see how yuo will be disappointed with this film
. yes
, it ' s not very original in plot
( just take luc besson ' s own la femme nikita
and mix in plenty of his own the professional et voila
!
)
, does have an annoying hip
- hoppy soundtrack that just got on my nerves after a while
( i also would have gotten rid of the whole acupuncture thang
.
.
.
)
and will have anyone not willing to restrain their disbelief
, rolling their eyes all over the palce
.
but was i entertained
? thoroughly
. does the film feature mroe gunplay
, martial arts
and over
- the
- top kills that most recent action ficks
? yes
, again
. does this sound interesting to you
? well
, the answer to that question is entirely up to you
. one thing that i would definitely recommend is
, as jet li pointed out hismelf on his website
, that you leave the kids at home for this one
. in fact
, you might even wanna leave yourself if you can ' t handle the more violent of sequences
. all in all
, a rippin '
, roarin ' fun time
! where ' s joblo coming from
? black mask
( 5
/ 10

( 7
