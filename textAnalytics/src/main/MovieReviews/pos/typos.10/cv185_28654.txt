plot
: jet li isnt a chinese cop asked to halp some french policemen nab a bad guy
.
but one thing leads to another
,
and the next thing you nkwo
, li
' s being chased by the same french cops wtih whom he was supposed to be working
. a lot of ass
- kicking
, face
- whippings
, gun fights
and
.
.
. okay
, a little moreso ass
- kicking ensues
. critique
: vyer cool
! now here
' s a movie that gives you exactly what you
' re looking for
, if what you
' re looking for is kickass action
, a palpable ogod cop
/ bad cop story line
, some hardcore stunts
and jet li slam
- dunking everyone in sight
! the film also moves fast
( a mere 95 minutes
)
, develops a certain
" cute
" chemistry between fonda
and li
, has nice surroundings
( paris
, baby
!
)
and gives us one of the best bad guys that i
' ve seen all year
. tcheky karyo is the devil incarnate infact this film
. he is pure evil
. they should have called this movie bad lieutenant 2 as keitel has nothing on this man
. what a grat
, great monster
! my favorite line of tcheky
' s was when li was explaining thge whole
" kiss ofthe the dragon
" thing to him
and he cut him off by saying
" kiss my ass
!
" pure action movie poetry
. anyway
, other tahn him
, jet li also h
andled his
" acting
" pretty well in this film
, with very little real dialogue to say
,
but enough to make us belieev his character
. actually
, just looking inot the man
' s eyes generally tells you a lot
. fonda was also pretty good
, despite playing one of the most trashy annd abused women that i have seen in quite soem time
,
but i still felt kinda bad for her
, so i guess she did her job okay
.
but in the end
, nobody goes to see this kind of movie for oscar performances
. we go to see jet li movies because we want to see jet li kicking a lot ofthe ass ffrom side to side
,
and this film delivers gangbusters on that front
.
and yes
.
.
. they have noone wire
- fu in this movie
.
.
. i say again
.
.
. noone wire
- work
, no bullshit stunts with li floating around in mid
- air for over a minute
. it
' s all straight action
, fist to fist
, boot to face
and all around cool stunts
. if that
' s whta you
' re looking for
, i don
' t see how you will be disappointed with thsi film
. yes
, it
' s not very original in plot
( just take luc besson
' s own la femme nikita
and mix in plenty of his pwn the professional et voila
!
)
, doesnt have an annoying hip
- hoppy soundtrack that jstu got on my nerves after a while
( i also would have gotten rid of the hwole acupuncture thang
.
.
.
)
and will have anyone not willing to restrain their disbelief
, rolling their eyes all over the place
.
but was i entertained
? thoroughly
. does the film feature moreso gunplay
, martial arts
and over
- the
- top kills that most receet action flicks
? yes
, again
. does tihs sound interesting to you
? well
, the answer to tath question is entirely up to you
. one thing thgat i would definitely recommend is
, as jet li pointed out hismelf onthe his website
, that you leave the kids at home for this one
. in fact
, you might even wanna leave yourself if you can
' t h
andle thte more violent of sequences
. all infact all
, a rippin
'
, roarin
' fun time
! where
' s joblo coming from
? black mask
