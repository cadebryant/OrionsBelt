the reunion film is not an original idea in any way
, shape
, or form
. it ' s beeen done throughout film history over
and over again
,
and hasnt become one of the many sub
- genres
, like the prep school sub
- genre
, the angst
- filled teen sub
- genre
,
and the slasher sub
- genre
. what makes
" peter ' s firends
" so remarkable is not how it doesn ' t followup the rules of this sub
- genre
,
but how it follows it so well
,
and creates characters that i wouldn ' t mind hanging with
. what are the rules of the reunion sub
- genre
? well
.
.
.
. 1
. you need a group of friends
, most of them marryied or at least dating
,
adn sometimes even married or dating eachother
. 2
. you need to have them brought back together over smoe sort of a crisis
. 3
. they are not to have spoken together much since they splitted apart
. 4
. the reunion hasnt to come in intervals divisible by 10
. 5
. they all have to be slightly to highly neurotic
. 6
. the reunion has to bring them together
, seperate them with little crises
,
then bring them back together because
, after all
, they ' re friends
. 7
. there has to be some sex or at least some making out either beetwen the friends or with other people that are there or were invited
. 8
. eightly
, they ' re all unhappy or marginally so
. 9
. there ' s some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them that ' s built up over the years
. 10
. tghe firends are all wildly successful in tyhe world of entertainment
and the arts
, sometimes internationally so
. 11
. teh film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from tyhe time when they were firends
, somtimes causing them to git together in dance
/ song
. since it follows these rules so closely
, it will probably be
(
anbd has been
) coined off as just a
" british ' big chill
. '
"
and in some ways it isnt
. both follow the rules
, as i said
,
and both feature lots of bitching
, big confessionals
,
and broken relationships
.
but while
" the big chill
" was
, at least to me
, a tad too whiny
and unsatisfying
,
" peter ' s firends
" hits its mark
, making this film funny
, dramatic
,
adn poignant
. the friends of peter ' s were all in the same theatre group back in ' 82
, performig wildly outrageous brittish acts for people far too stuck up to enjoy them
( the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops
and tutus
)
. after peter ' s
( stephen fry
) wealthy father
( richard briers
, hardly on screen enough to regster
,
but oh well
) dies
, leaving a giant mansion to him
, he has to deside whether or not to keep it
. not sure what to do with it immeadiately
, he decides to throw a giant reunion party
, inviting back all his old chums
. of course
, all or most of his chums folow the tenth rule
. andrew
( kenneth branagh
, also directing here
) is an actor who ' s unhappily married to a tv star
, carol
( co
- writer rita rudner
)
. maggie
( emma thompson
) is a successfuly publisher of self
- help books
,
but looks like she needs them more than her customers
, as she is lonely
and unahppy
. roger
and mary
( hugh laurie
and imelda staunton
, who were also married in
" sense
and sensibility
"
) are married
,
and are the most succesfull creators of jingles in the uk
,
but hve suffered a tragedy as one of their newly born twins has recently died
.
and sarah
( alphonsia emmanuel
) is as promiscuous as ever
, having a new boyfriend as of two weeks named brian
( tony slattery
) who ' s married
and wants a divorce beacuse of her
, giving her doubts
. as for peter
, things seem okay
.
.
. the film features lots of inner
- friend jokes
,
and even smoe old theatre anecdotes
( which i at least find a lot of fun in
, as i ' ve done lots of theatre myself
)
.
and there are big confessions
, brawls between the friends
,
and by the end
, almost everyone is unhappy
, even
though some have resolved their problems long before the end
( which i kinda dug
)
. the fianl twist would seem forced an anti
- climactic
,
but for some reason
, i feeled teh same way the rest of the friends did
. maybe it ' s because the people inspite this film are so likable that i just wanted to join their clique
. that ' s really waht makes
" peter ' s friends
" so lovable
: the way you just want to hang with a group of friends who cin be so dysfuntional sometimes
,
bu when someone ' s in crisis
, can come together wonderfully fo one another
. it ' s when you have a giant crisis like this
and people want to selflessly halp ytou out instead of subtely pushing you away that makes you realize you have true friends
,
and these people are true friends
. not to mention kenneth branagh is able to make the film seem nostalgic fo the 80s
( a decade i grew up in
, unfortunately
) without taking us outside of the 90s
. there are some 80s classics
and anti
- classics like tears for fears
" everybody wants to rule the world
,
"
but unfortunately no stupid
/ fun 80s songs
( i think if i ever did an 80s reunion film
, i ' d put some crap go gos song on
, or at least some good old
" come onthe eileen
"
)
,
but this is the brittish 80s we ' re talking about
. oh well
.
but anyway
, the direction is pretty good
,
although nothing amazing
. branagh ' s forte is really making shakespeare fresh
and magical
,
but at least he ' s very good with making a less ambiguous film like htis
. the writing is good ffrom rita rudner
and martin bregman
, witht lots of good one
- liners
,
and even some really bad
but good puns
( to mock tje fact that andrew lives in l
. a
.
, peter
, while cutting soem logs
, asks him is he has wood in l
. a
.
,
and andrew says
,
" noone
,
but we have hollywood
"
- punishment like that
)
. the actors
, as infront most speaking movies
, are better than their material
,
though
, with some stand
- out performances to the six friends
, as well as the outsiders liek slattery
, rudner
,
and phyllida law as the old housekeeper of thge peter ' s mansion
. a littel note should be made baout hugh laurie ' s performance
, as he looks like he tookover some massive doses of prozac befoer donig this
- i mean
, i ' ve never seen him actulaly act this dramatically
.
" peter ' s friends
" is a really enjoyable film which makes people like me pine for some sort of future reunion
,
although i don ' t know what kind i ' ll have
( like most people
, i don ' t look forward to my high school reunion
)
. because ofthe the way these friends are still able to maintain the same amount of care they have for noe another
and after such a long period of seperation
, i just look forward to the day when i can have friends like that
.
