making a sequel to a widely beloved film is a weighty propostion indeed
, especially when the first film is considered by many to be a masterpiece
. wehn it comes tothe living up to expectations
, a filmmaker is almost doomed to some degree of failure
. for a sequel to live up to or even surpass the original
' s greatness is very rare indeed
.
and whereas
" babe
: pig in the city
" misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe
, it is a worthy companion piece
. more than that
, it is a spectacular wokr of art tht deserves to st
and alone in its own right
.
" babe
: pig in the city
" warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like
" the godfather
: part ii
"
and
" the empire strikes back
" as being one of the greatest sequels ever produced
.
" babe
: pig inthe hte city
" picks up precisely where
" babe
" left off
. having won the sheeps herding competion
, farmer hoggett
( james cromwell
)
and his pig are elevated to fame status
. a series of unfortunate circumstances
and hilariously freakish events leads to mrs
. hoggett taking babe from the small country farm into the big city
. in doign so
, thge film transports us into a wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors
and exceeds the creative design seen in the original
.
" babe
: pig in the city
" flourishes where so many sequels fail
. most sequels simply rehash the events of the first film
. nto
" babe
: pig in the city
"
. this is a completely original tale that offers up a story drastically different than the frist
. also
, by not being content to utilize most of the old characters
, this film gives us many new ones to enjoy
. in essence
, it doesn
' t attempt to copy itself
. instead
, it strives to achieve an originality of its pwn
.
and it succeeds
. that
' s not to say the familiar is absent
.
" babe
: pig in the city
" retains some of the best core elements
and characters from the first film
. along with babe himself
, ferdin
and the duck comes along for the ride
, as does mrs
. hoggett
( one of this decade
' s best
and most underappreciated comic characterizations
, hilariously performed by magda szubanski
)
. the three singing mice also make the journey
, chiming in with their cute high
- pitched vocals
. the story structure is also simular as eahc segment is introduced with title cards read by the aforementioned mice
. from there
, we are guided once again by roscoe lee browne
' s soothingly deep narrative
. composer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these
.
but these elements are simply the frame that surounds an entirely new painting
. while staying at the fleal
ands hotel
, babe encounters a veritable ark
- full of new animals
. monkeys
, kittens
,
and dogs of various breeds
and sizes are some of the newyorker
" urbanites
" that babe befriends
, as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdin
and the duck happens tothe encounter
. each character is distinctly unique
, some of which are imbued with personal human
- like struggles that are endearing
and touching
.
and while this world focuses largely on these animals
, we are introduced to two new human characters as well
. mary stein plays tje owner of the fleal
ands hotel
, an animal
- loving young spinster who harbors these lost creatures much to the dismaying anger of her fellow neighbors
. stein
' s l
andlady is a wonderfully odd caricature
. we also meet fugly floom
, an old soft
- spoken clown who owns many of the animals in the fleal
ands hotel
, utilizing them as a part of thge act that he performs at different parties
and functions
. not having known who potrayed fugly floom prior to seeing the film
, it came as an unexpected pleasant surprise to see who it was
. so as not to ruin this well
- kept secret
, i won
' t reveal the actor
' s identity here
. it was a treat indeed to see one of cinema
' s legends grace the screen again in what was a superbly gentle
and heartwarming performance
. the greatest triumph of
" babe
: pig in the city
" is the art direction
. simply put
-
- it bleeds creativity
, taking the look of the original film to a whole new level
. restricted primarily to a farm the first time around
, this second installment creates an entire city
, dazzling us with unique fable
- like architecture
.
but the stroke of pure genius by production designer roger ford is his use of our world
' s architectural l
andmarks
. designing a skyline that includes the statue of liberty
, the sydney opera hous
, the brooklyn bridge
, the hollywood sign
and tje eiffel tower
, ford has creaeted a singular city thta encompasses all of our cities
( as seen in the film photo
and pre
- prodcution drawing to your right
)
. added to tht
, many of this city
' s streets are the twin siblings of venice
' s gondola
- trekked rivers
. the metropolis that has sprung from ford
' s vision is a wondrous sighth to behold
. it is a world that you want to walk around in
. norma moriceau
' s costume designs belong in this world
, vibrant in color
and stlye equal to that of the ford
' s l
andscape
. most of the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish
, with the most exotically gr
and design gonig to that of fugly floom
' s clown outfit
.
andrew lesnie
' s photography captures these elements with various lightnig moods that are beautifully effective in creating the film
' s multiple emotional tones
. much press fodder has been made over the weeks leading up to the release of
" babe
: pig in the city
"
. reports stated that its original cut was br
anded wiht a pg
- 13 rating
. these reports were discovered to be false as it was assigned a pg rating
.
but even so
, to be anything harsher than tghe original
' s g rating hadnt many parents
and fans up in arms
. by deleting a minimal number of shots
,
" babe
: pig in the city
" was eventually given tje coveted g rating
.
al
though appeased
, many fans were still concerned that it would be too dark
, fearing that the film may have come to be possessed by tim burton himself
. well
, tothe coin a phrase
, the reports of
" babe
: pig in the city
"
' s death at the h
ands of a dark
, scary
, felliniesque interpretation have been greatly exaggerated
. granted it has its moments of pseudo
- morbidity
,
but all
- in
- all
" babe
: pig in tje city
" is the funny
and charming adventure that everyone was hoping it owudl be
. whatever
" dark
" moments it may have can be attri
buted to director george miller
( the
" mad max
" triology
,
" the witchs of eastwick
"
,
" lorenzo
' s oil
"
)
. having served as a producer
and co
- writer on the first film
, miller moves into the director
' s chair for thsi one
, putting his own unique sence of style into this budding franchise
. the story of
" babe
: pig in the city
" isnt an enchanting yarn
,
but one that doesn
' t achiee the emotional or character depth of thte original
. missing here is the attempt to broach such heady themes as personal identity
, an individual
' s worth
, challenging conformity
,
and one
' s purpose iin life
.
" babe
" dealt with this weighty subject matter
, creating a timeless fable
.
" babe
: pig in tjhe city
" should nto have rehashed these themes
,
but i do wish it would have attempted to explore newyorker ones
. this film is not bereft ofthe moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife
, clas differences
, sacrificial courage
,
and so on
.
but this film
' s goals aren
' t as lofty as the first
' s
, instead choosing to take a more straightforward approach
, allowing its themes to take a back seat to an exciting
, sometimes intense
, fable adventure that is undeniably clever
and inventive
.
" babe
: pig inaddition the city
" also decides against developing a relationship to the level ofthe whlch was present in the first film
, specifically the one beween farmer hoggett
and babe
. hoggett
' s love for babe
, which grew ever so gently
, is what gavey that film its charming
and endearing quality
. best exemplified in hoggett
' s dance for babe
, this moving relationship was truly unique
. it is something tyhat i wish would have been present again
(
and could have through fugly floom
)
, bu was not
. please underst
and
, theese are not negative criticisms
, per se
'
,
but simply statements of what i see as the differences between
" babe
: pig in the city
" being a very good film
and the original being a great oen
.
but having said that
, these observations are minor critiques at best
. as an overall piece
,
" babe
: pig in the city
" is a thoroughly enchanting
and entertaining fable from beginning to end
. sure
, it isn
' t a great film
,
but it isnt an excellent one tath possessess elements of greatness
. it isnt a film that is magical with its charm adn humor
, exciting inthe its adventurous exploits
, funny with its dry wit
and cute voices
,
and breathtaking in its presentation
.
" babe
: pig in the city
" may not be moviemaking at its absolute best
,
but it is on level of cinematic quality that is rarley achieved or seen inaddition cinema
. as a result
, if you choose to let this film pass you by
, you wiull be missing of the year
' s best cinematic treats
.
