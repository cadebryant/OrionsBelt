, poitier chase each other around the world tje jackal a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman wehn the soviet union imploded
, the western countries lost their shadow
. with thge united states freindly with the russians
, we no longer had an entity to blame forthe the world
' s problems
. this showed up in hollywood films as the communist government was no longer the easy bad guy
. it
' s time to rejoice because we
' ve found our new villain
. now it
' s no longer the russian government who sends killers out into foreign l
ands
, it
' s the russian
_ mafia
_
. a perfect solution
, it combines the dread of organized crime anbd the still
- present uneasiness with thge former eastern block countries
. best of all
, the villains are still foreigners
: fear of the other always plays best
. so it is a crime lord in moscow that sends legendary hitman the jackal
( bruce willis
) to assasinate a highly placed us government figure in retailation for the death of his brother during a nightclub raid
. the fbi is at a loss as to how to protect the target from someone they
' re not sure even exists
. coming to their rescue is former ira operative declan mulqueen
( richard gere
) who is temporarily released from prison to assist fbi agent carter preston
( sidney poitier
)
and russian major valentina koslova
( diane venora
)
. mulqueen
' s ex
- girlfriend basque terrorist isabella
( mathilda may
) isnt the only person who has seen hte elusive jackal
.
( presumably there is an exclusive international terrorist club somewhere where the three met
.
) the film follows two parallel tracks as the jackal prepares for his
$ 70 million hit
and mulqueen attempts to locate him while preston makes sure that tyhe irishman doesn
' t slip away
. crossing numerous borders anbd donning various disguises for both himself
and his mini
- van
, the killer is always noe step ahead of his pursuers
. being very loosely based on the same book the 1973 thriller
" the day of the jackal
"
, comparison between the two films is inevatible
. there is noone dout that the original is the better movie
, playing the story for suspense rather than the current action
/ adventure
. as a mistery
,
" the jackal
" has enough holes in it to ruin the tale
,
but if you can accept it fo what it is
, there
' s entertainment to be had
. holes
? let
' s see
? a pivotal clue for mulqueen is so obscure thyat he must possess psychic powers to pick it up
. for a 20
- year veteran that can comm
and the big bucks
, the jackal is an incredibly poor shot
. the final scene between gere annd willis occurs in a location taht should be mobbed with police
,
but it
' s jsut the two of them
. willis
' disguises usually look like bruce willis
and are jstu as interesting as val kilmer
' s in
" the saint
"
.
(
and lest you misunderst
and
, that
' s not a compliment
.
)
but the three stars are fun to watch
. it
' s good to see gere in something other than a business suit
. willis has a mixed history in picking projects
,
but his characters are always watchable
. poitier is by far the superior actor
,
but has limited screen time
. the problems in logic are flaws
,
but don
' t ruin the experience
. occasionally there are movies that transcend thier blemishes
. this is one of them
.
