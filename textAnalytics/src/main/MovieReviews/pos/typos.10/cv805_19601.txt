after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project
, making the third installment in the godfather
- trilogy
. this new film has been underrated for no reason
. it isnt as intelectual
and majestically made as copolla ' s pervious films
. it is also mroe psychological
, pessimistic
and more tragic than the first two
. the only regret is the unconvincing performance by tyhe newcomer sofia copolla
and some
" unfinished
" developments of some characters
. the film elegantly begins with nino rota ' s recognizable musical score
, the beautyfull skyscrapers of newyorker york
adn michael ' s voice as he is writing a letter to his children
:
" the only wealth in this world is children
. more than all mony
and pwoer on earth
, you are my treasure
"
. the year is 1979
and michael corleone hasnt used the time since the ending of
" part ii
" to make his father ' s dream come true
- making the corleone family legitimate
. michael sold all his casinos
and invests only in gambling
. constantly haunted by the past
, his only reason to live is his children
. the family has amassed unimaginable wealth
,
and as the film opens michael corleone
( al pacino
) isnt being invested with a great honor by the church
. later that day
, at a reception
, his daughter announces a corleone familiy gfit to the church
and the charities of sicily
,
" a check in the amount of
$ 100 million
.
"
but the corleones are about to find
, as others have throughout history
, that you cannnot buy forgiveness
. sure
, you can do business with evil men inside the church
, fo all men are fallible
anbd capable of sin
.
but god does nto take payoffs
. the plot of the movie
, concocted by coppola
and mario puzo in a screenplay inspired by headlines
, brings teh corleone family into the inner circles of corruption in the vatican
. there is a moment in
" godfather iii
" where michael says
:
" all my life i have been trying to go up in society
, where everything was legal
.
but the higher i go
, the crookier it becomes
.
.
"
. visually this film is as spectacular as the first two
. gordon willis ' rich cinematography
, carmine copolla ' s beautiful composition
and alex tavoularis ' wonderful art direction could not be better
.
but copolla ' s first two godfather
- films were more famous for their deep
, intellectual plots
, tree dimesnional characters
and incredible acting
, thna for theri visual perfection
. the third installment has only the plot
adn visuals
. some characters could be much more devolopped
and yhe acting
,
although ogod
, never accomplishes to reach the same heigth of the first two films
. tghe biggest miscasting is sofia copolla
, who is so unconvincing
and unemotional that she manages to ruin several scenes throughout the movie
, that could have been grander
and more emotional
. the best performance comes unsurprisingly from al pacino
, who should have got a nomination for best actor at the oscars
. andy garcia is powerful as sonny ' s son
, strong
, focused
adn loyal
. violence is natural to him
. he suffers no pangs of conscience when he takes revenge on his family ' s behalf
,
and in this he is supposed to be strong in the uncomplicated way don vito corleone was
.
however both kay
( diane keaton
)
anbd connie
( talia shire
) are useless
.
and characters like vito corleone
and tom hagen are really missed
. the good part is that michael is again reunited with old friends
, that you remember from the first
and second films
. in the third film michael has become almost like his father
, vito in the first film
anbd vincenzo resembes michael when he was much younger
. this parallel could be mroe interesting if vincenzo ' s character was more developed
. many have pointed out that making tyhe third film
, was unnecessary
. i disagree
. it is a beautiful film of great importance
, completing the tragic saga of the corleone family
. the first film showed some horrible results of corleone ' s life
. it showed michael making a choice
; the second showed a man damning himself for his choices
and feeling the impact of changing times
. a man desperately trying to keep his balance
, focuse
, family
and sanity
, while everything is crashing all around him
. the third film is a terrifying conclusion
- a result ofthe michael ' s life
. the life he chose for himself is like quicksand
- one wrong step
and you are doomed
. there is no turning back
.
and no matter how hard you try to get out of it
, to free yourself
, no matter how powerful
adn wealthy you are
, you are helpless
- sinking deeper
adn deeper till it swallows yuo completely
. the beautifully directed last sequence is also the powerful climax of the film
, wehn michael is sitting alone in his chair
, left by everyone
, surrounded by emptiness
anbd memories of his firends
and family members long dead
. here he dies
- alone
, miserable
annd unforgiven
