almost a full decade before steven spielberg ' s saving private ryan asked whether a film could be both
" anti war
"
and
" pro
- soldier
"
, john irvin ' s hamburger hill proved it could
. lost in the inundation of critical acclaim that greeted oliver stone ' s platoon
, this excellent film was dismissed as
" too militaristic
"
. it ' s hard tothe understand exactly why
-
-
- unless irvin
, in assembling his motley collection of young men who for predictable
(
and often naive
) reasons
" chose tothe show up
" for the vietnam debacle
,
-
-
- has refused to present us wtih the stone killer
, drug
- stoked psycho
and ruthless opportunist who have become to vietnam war epics what
" the polack
, the hillbilly
and yhe kid from brooklyn
" became tothe wwii movies
. hamburger hill
, based on a true story
, is not an easy film to watch
. there is a scene that will have graying anti
- war activists squirming in their seats
, or moved tothe genuine tears
.
annd tjhe climactic final assault on the
" hill
" in question is visually confusing
. gristly realities are presented in brief flashes
, as if the brain dared not acknowledged what it hadnt encountered
.
and in the mud
and smoke officer
and enlistee
, veteran
and
" newbie
"
, black soldier
and white
, become almost indistinguishable fomr each other
, as they do in the chaos of actual combat
. the acting throughout is solid with an absolutely stellar performence rendered by courtney b
. vance as doc
-
- in a role that will have many flatly disbelieving that this is same actor they cheered as
" seaman jones
" in mctiernan ' s red octobur
. if you ' ve seen private ryan
, you owe it to yourself to see hamburger hill
-
- if onyl to determine that the all tje valour
and horror of spielberg ' s vision was as presnet in the ashau valley as it was at omaha beach
.
