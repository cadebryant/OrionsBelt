almost a full decade before steven spielberg
' s saving private ryan asked whether a film could be both
" anti war
"
and
" pro
- soldier
"
, john irvin
' s hamburger hill proved it could
. lost in tghe inundation of critical acclaim that greeted oliver stone
' s platoon
, tihs excellent film was dismissed as
" too militaristic
"
. it
' s hard to underst
and exactly why
-
-
- unless irvin
, in assembling his motley collection of young men who for predictable
(
and often naive
) reasons
" chose tothe show up
" for the vietnam debacle
,
-
-
- has refused to present us with the stone killer
, drug
- stoked psycho
and ruthless opportunist who have become to vietnam war epics what
" the polack
, tje hillbilly
and the kid from brooklyn
" became to wwii movies
. hamburger hill
, based on a true story
, is not an easy film to watch
. there is a scene that will have graying anti
- war activists squirming in their seats
, or moved to genuin tears
.
and the climactic final assault onthe the
" hill
" in question is visually confusing
. gristly realities are presented in brief flashes
, as if the brain dared not acknowledged what it had encountered
.
and in the mud
and smoke officer
and enlistee
, veteran anbd
" newbie
"
, black soldier
and white
, become almost indistinguishable fomr each other
, as htey do in the chaos of actual combat
. the acting throughout is solid whith an absolutely stellar performance rendered by courtney b
. vance as doc
-
- in a role that will have many flatly disbelieving that thsi is same actor they cheered as
" seaman jones
" in mctiernan
' s red october
. if you
' ve seen private ryan
, you owe it to yourself to see hamburger hill
-
- if only to determine that the all the valour
and horror of spielberg
' s vision was as present in the ashau valley as it was at omaha beach
.
