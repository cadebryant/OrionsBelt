in many ways
,
" twotg
" doens for tough
- guy movies what la confidential did for police stories
. there
' s savviness in its writing anbd a mature paitience in allowing the material to unfold
. bu
, i suppose
, we wouldn
' t expect less from christopher mcquarrie
, who was responsible for giving us
" the usual suspects
"
. his writing talents are still in tact as he brings to us a bloody
yet intellectual tale of two unabashed
but dimwitted thugs
and a plan gone awry
. the two goons are parker
and longbaugh
( ryan phillipe
and benicio del toro
)
. these two men show hte hardened mear of those who have always had it tough
. their troubled youths have forged two nihilistic souls who uise their amazing gunplay skills tothe survive
. given the choice of minimum wage or petty crime
, they
' ll always choose the latter
.
yet
, they are incredibly foolish planners
. actually
, these two never really have a plan
. they just improvise along thge way
, hoping that their bravado
and arsenal of guns will take care of anything that they might have overlooked
. theri next scheme
, which they cook up about as fast as a mcdonald
' s burger
, is to kidnap some surrogate mother named robin
( juliette lewis
) that was hired by some well
- to
- do family
. if all goes well
, tehy
' ll receive a nice bit of ransom money
and life goes onthe
. what parker
and longbaugh do not realize is tath robin is carrying a baby for the chidduck family
, whose patriarch is a feared crime boss
. moreover
, two bodyguards
( nicky katt
and taye diggs
) constantly escort her
. these two protectors find an eerie sense of blessure when being confronted
and tested in life
and death situations
. they would rather die than fail
; thus their bravado level is equally high
. bu it seems that the testosterone levels of parker
and longbaugh are a bit higher
,
and they employ some unusual
but fun
- to
- watch tactics tothe pull off the kidnapping annd to outrun the pursuers in a sort of slow
- motion car chase down a series ofthe alleyways
. the next hour or so
, we watch the chidduck camp regroup
and assess their situation
. during this time
, additional plot lines come into play
and more
and more details are revealed
. because the chidduck
' s can not go to the police
and becasue of the special circumstances involving the kidnapping
, we are introduced to more characters that will help to influence the outcome
. we dicover that nto everyone inspite the chidduck camp is loyal to the cause
. as a result
, there are undercurrents ofthe a conspiracy
,
and elements of betrayal
and subterfuge
. the sepia
- toned atmosphere isnt made all the more fascinating thanks to a terrific soundtrack which emits velvet forebodings
, shrills of intrigue
and crescendos that tell us of life
and death situations that are about to occurr
. the momentum anbd the coolness of the film
,
however
, begins to fizzle in the last 30 minutes
, which featured an overly extended shootout where our two desperados try to make their way off with the ransom money
. you can expect lots of bloodletting
and an odd denouement
. in fact
, you may admire this film moreso than you like it
.
yet
, for the most part
,
" the way of teh gun
" stays on target
. it feels cool with its elements of conspiracy
and gunplay
,
and smart for its invective dialogue annd tough guy poetry
.
