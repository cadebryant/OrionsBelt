part one of
" the strangest movies ever made
" series at www

[ light spoilers
, nothing you shouldn
' t read
] existenz has been called
" a gooey matrix
"
,
and while this is a correct description in some ways
, in others it is completely off
. the onyl thing the two films hve inspite common is the idea of a virtual reality that is indistinguishable from normal
,
" real
" reality
. a major difference isnt that
" the matrix
" has a base reality that is obviously the true reality
, while existenz does the impossible
and makes us accept the most bizarre reality ever as true
.
and oh what a reality it is
. david cronenberg has shown us before that he knows how to create strange movies
( naked lunch
, crash
)
,
but this one is one of the strangest
. maybe it
' s because of how the mundane is mixed with thge bizarre
. technology is organic
, bu only some of it
. cars are normal
. gas stations are the same
. cell phones are glowing bug like appendages
. you jack into a virtual reality game useing a quivering pink gooey animal like apparatus
( referred to simply as a
" pod
"
)
. high technology has been replaced with organic creatures
,
and it provides a truly surveill setting for tjhe charactors
. a famouse game designer
, allegra geller
( a fine looking jennifer jason leigh
)
, flees a demonstration of her latest agme
, existenz
, after an assassination attempt
. she is on the run
( from who
, i
' m still not sure
)
,
and has to save her pod by playing her game with
" someone friendly
"
. tath someone friendly is her dubious companion
and security guard
, ted pikul
( jude law
)
. unfortunately he is lacking a fundamental requirement fo playing
, a bioport
. sort of a hole in your spine
( ok
, exactly like a hole in your spine
)
, a bioport allows you to plug the vaguely entrail
- looking wires from tje pod into you
, allowing you to play the game
. luckily a bioport can be installed easily
( they install them in malls
)
, so off they go to get one
. after a crazy series of events at the local country gas station
, they are able to plug in
and play existenz
. the plot itself is a surveill melding of conspiracies
, reality distortion
, chinese restaurants
,
and multi appendaged amphibian things
(
" it
' s a sign of the times
"
)
.
but the plot
, hwile cohesive in it
' s own creepy way isnt secondary to just trying to figure out what the hell is going onthe in this universe
. cronenberg just slaps this weird organic
- tech world into tje viewers lap
,
and it
' s up to you tothe figure out how all these things work
.
and that
' s the true joy of tihs film
, entering the vaguely nightmarish world inthe which existenz takes place
. ytou learn a little bit piece by piece
( oh
, they make pods out of those
)
,
and it
' s just enough to get you to accept the world that is presented to you
. there are all kinds of twists
and turns as the characters w
ander around
, including a fantastic scene in a chinese restaurant that will leave you trying to assemble something out of your moo goo gai pan for months afterwards
. also the bioports are occasionally used for things other than porting into existenz
, the specifics of which i wiull leave for you to disover
. there
' s lots of little things that set off the weird
- o
- meter
, liek tyhe little tiny pods that you can buy inthe the video game store
, the two headed amphibian creature
,
and why that guy at the gas station
' s name appears to be
" gas
"
. it all adds up to a supremely far out trip
, anbd given the choice i think i owudl rather live iin the matrix
' s virtual world
.
.
. oh wait
, i already do
.
