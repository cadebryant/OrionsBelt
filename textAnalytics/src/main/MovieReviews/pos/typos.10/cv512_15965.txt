it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship
, a gren ovular pin
,
and teh birth of oscar wilde
,
but if one really strains
, they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are nto half off
. wilde
' s philosophy was that everyone should be true to their pwn human nature
,
and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprioned
, loosing his family
and his carrer
. the glam rock movement in the early 70s in engl
and had a similar take
and came to a similar demise
. the main difference was by placing makeup on their face
and acting out on their deepest fantasies
and inquiries about life
( mostly dealing with
androgony
and sexuality
)
, they became less
and less like themselves
and more
and more like everyone else
.
and that
' s why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began
. it
' s been said that todd haynes
'
" velvet goldmine
,
" thte film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement
, not only from those who experienced it
but by those who created it
, steals a lot from
" citizen kane
,
"
and that
' s true
. in the film
, a british journalist in the 80s
, arthur stuart
( christian bale
)
, is asked to go bcak
and find out what hapened to 70s glam rock star brian slade
, a fictitious rock star
, who faked his pwn death on stage
, bringing the end not onyl to his career
but to the entire glam rock movement
. structure
- wise
, this totally steals from
" kane
,
" not only from the set
- up
( he interviews threee people
,
and the story is a result of their flashbacks
)
,
but in other things
, like the beginning
( death
,
then newsreel
)
,
and smaller details
, like tghe bitter ex
- firend infront a wheelchair
and the bitter ex
- wife as a washed
- up lounge singer
, found in a bar after hours
. this is noone
" kane
,
" adn it really doesn
' t aspire to be
: it doesn
' t attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like
" kane
" did
,
and it doesn
' t really uncover anything poignant about humanity
. instead
, it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era
and the boredom that was life after glam rock for thsoe who weere participants
. the 80s scenes are dry
and deliriously melancholy
, equipped wih a performance by bale thgat is perhaps appropriately dull anbd unengaging
.
but the 70s scenes are engaging
,
though
, not to mention addictively campy
. they radiate wtih gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era
,
and a fiel that
' s so eerily lighthearted that when combined with the thne
- footage
, they become not onyl a symbol ofthe decadence
,
but ofthe times when everything seemed so simple
. instead of creating the world the way it was
, haynes paints their own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale
: the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom
and liberation that after you
' ve experienced it
, everything else seems so mundane
. there
' s no outside world to speak of
, secluding theese people inside a protective globe that iwll eventually crack
. haynes focuses his story on the tale of blade
and the other ficticious rock hero
, curt wild
,
and theri relationship that created
, molded
,
and
then brought down thte movement
, reducing everyone eles who contri
buted to it as merely that
- contri
butors
. blade
- played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers
-
and wild
- played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor
- are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie
and iggy pop
, respectively
, complete with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon
and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been one
- timne partners in music
,
but also partners in bed
. through discussions with slade
' s ex
- manager cecil
( michael feast
)
, ex
- wife m
andy
( toni collette
, reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when withthe slade
)
,
and finally ex
- partner wild
, journalist stuart begins to remember his pwn experiences in thte era
, like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity
, including teh moment when he began questioning his own sexuality
( when he opens up his first slade record
, he finds a naked
and green slade lying on a crimson blanket
)
,
and finally running away from home to be part of the london scene
, finally resulting in leading a boring job in america
. haynes demonstrates that he
' s quite the visual auteur
, molding scenes that are like long heald breaths
, such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a slade
/ wild concert of them performing a brian eno cover
,
" baby
' s on fire
,
" with scenes ffrom a decadent drug party
; anbd the film
' s most wow
- inspiring sequence
, the first concert scene of wild with his b
and
, the ratttz
, where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggy
- esuqe movements
( including stripping naked
)
and screams that the film captures that perfect moment when one dicovers a major talent
,
and another
( slade
) discovers his idle
. even the brief music videos
, spoofs of bowie
' s
, have a rare visual flair thta
' s pure camp
,
and which would cause ken russell to drool
. the best sequence
,
though
, may be the beginning
, following tyhe prelude
, a sequence which acts as tyhe middle ground for both the actual being of the movement
and the post
- movement era
. inthe it
, stuart
and his mates are going tothe tjhe infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death
, where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in waht appears to be a real assasination
, which brought baout the end of the era in one swift fake bullet
. with brian eno
' s famoust
" needle in the camel
' s eye
" playing in the background
, the scene has a detached exhileration
- the song doesn
' t seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are
. it has a distance that
' s hard to put a finger on
,
and it seems tothe represent thyat all this is coming to a quick
and sad ending
,
and when one sees slade in the dressing room before the sohw
, docked in a silver frock with wings
and blue hair
, depressingly staring into the mirror
, it comes off as a none
- too
- obvious prophecy of the finale in the beggining of the film
. this movie
' s not so much about plot
,
but more about the way it is presented
, making this one of those films which is classified as being
" style over substace
,
" a statment whitch prompts many critics to line up for attack
.
however
, for tjhe most part
, the engaging part of this film is not the story
but rather the way in which haynes creates this world
, by using his sets
, costumes
, cinematography
,
and especially the music to play as characters in his film
. the music is expecially notable
. the soundtrack
, which is wall to wall
, consists of old school glam rock tunes by the likes of brian eno
, t
- rex
,
and roxy music
, as well as covers by slade
' s b
and
( with vocals by thom yorke
,
and occasionally rhys meyers himself
)
,
and even newer music by shudder to think that sounds uncannily bowie
- like
. the cast is rather impressive
,
but no one really walks away witht yhe film
,
and no performances are extremely good
.
al
though eddie izzard
, as slade
' s manager
( who challenges slade
' s first manager to an arm
- wrestling match to see who gets control of his career
)
and michael feast as the first
and tragic manager cmo off greatly
,
and collette
and mcgregor have their moments
, rhys meyers
and bale are noticably sub
- par
, neither putting a lot of effort inot their respective roles
. some of it is at fault with yhe actual construction of the film by haynes
. rhys meyers
' brian slade remains merely a methaphor for thte glam rock era
, dieing wehn he turned into a retro
- garbo
, resorting to a life of salinger
- ism
, annd found in the mid
- 70s tothe be lying around
, sniffing coke off the ass of a party girl
. in fact
, no one in this film is really seen as a person
, rather than just as a symbol or composite of a type who thrived during yhe era
. bale
' s character is an especialy tough sell
: bitter annd depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood
, he
' s not an extremely personal character
, anbd his cliched experiences
( bieng hounded by tje recrod store guys for buying a record put out by a
" poof
"
) never help us communicate wtih him
. nevertheless
, rhys meyers
and mcgregor hve the excuses that their characters are not really characters
but rather the results of an era that has left them
,
and others
, bitter
, part of which helps the film work
, since tihs isnt a major piece of eye c
andy
. at hte prime of the movie
, they at least look the role of fashionable leaders
- slade wtih his perpetually
- changeing
,
androgonys persona
,
and wild with his topless
and unpredictable image
, which clash
and fuse into an unstable union
. their story
- of how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into a similar who
- cares attitude crossed iwth camp
- isnt engaging
, without the personal background
. the story of stuart
,
though
, is a tougher sell because he
' s the everyman
,
and when ytou can
' t totally idenify with the everyman
, your story
' s in slight trouble
. as a cultural rock piece
,
" velvet goldmine
" is rather good
,
but it is merely good
. it never totally takes off
,
al
though it has moments where it absolutely flies
, bu
then comes back down
. it
' s really nothing more than a bunch of realy graet moments
, surrounded by material that could really be much better
. the beginning is captivating
but slow
, the middle is fantastic
,
and the ending is not only shallow
but worse than that
, it drags
( the final half hour not only does it not bring the story to any real conclusion
, it could probably stop at any point
)
.
and did anyone really figure out what the mystery is tyhat arthur unearths
? it almost seems like there was noone point in the entire investigation other than to unearth the past
, which is commendable
but not totally so
. still
, it doens what the oliver stone pic
" the doors
" didn
' t do right
, becoming very insightful to what happended
, using the visual sytle to hitted most of the right notes of contrast between what made the era so great tothe those who lived during it anbd why after living through such an era that everything else seems half
- assed
( i suppose the message is
:
" live life
,
but after you
' ve lived it
, what else is the point when you
' ll be forced to live with regretful memories
?
"
)
. the really superb achievement of thsi film is that during its flashbacks
, it sucesfuly creates forthe the audience what it must have felt like to be in that era
, bu with the added perk of knowing the result of all that goes down
.
