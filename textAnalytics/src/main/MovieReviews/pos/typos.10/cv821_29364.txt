an unhappy italian housewife
, a lonely waiter
, a goofy massoose
, lots of loev
,
and gorgeous scenery all come together in bread
and tulips
, which proves charming dispite its covering of predictable
, well
- worn material
. the story concerns the aforementioned housewife
, rosalba barletta
( licia maglietta
) who accidentally becomes separated from her imemdiate famaly while onthe vacation
. instead of waiting for a ride hmeo
, rosalba opts not tothe go home to her itallian town
,
but to instead hitchhike to venice
. upon arriving
, she tells her self
- centered husb
and
, mimmo
( an excellent antonio catania
) that she
' ll be home in a few days
. of course
, that doesn
' t happen
, as rosalba quickly gains a level ofthe independendet that has been unattainable in her past life of scrubbing floors
and buying groceries
. iin what seems like days
, she moves in with lonly
, suicidal waiter fern
ando
( bruno ganz
)
, gets a job as a florist
, learns the accordion
,
and befriends her neighbor
-
- a wacky holistic masseuse named grazia
( marina massironi
)
. rosalba
, who is first seen wearing a gaudy stretch pants outfit
, starts wearing sexy dresses
and getting closer to fern
ando
. i cxan think of at least five other
( american
) movies
( including fried green tomatos
and an unmarried woman
) that are more than similar to bread
and tulips
. bu maglietta
and ganz
, who act with restraint
and care
, help bread
and tulips from becoming a tired retread
. ganz plays yhe sucidial waiter role with a solemn
, sometimes playful dignity that is a joy to watch
, while maglietta never overreacts tothe her growing comfort with the outside world
. throughout tyhe movie
, maglietta has an easygoing
, confident demeanor
, which makes it very easy to root for her
and her growing attraction fo ganz
' s character
. the gorgeous scenery of moonlit town squares
and sparkling rivers provides a perfect love story backdrop
-
- you just might want to ask the attractive stranger in the seat behind you for coffee affter the lights come up
. director
and co
- writer silvio soldini must get credit for sprinkling the movei with effective goofy humor
. the cheap mimmo
, desperate to find his wife
( after all
, he needs his shirts ironed
and his mistress won
' t do it
)
, hires a job applicant
( giuseppe battiston
) at his bathroom supply firm to do the job
. tghe reason
? mimmo discovers that the prospective plumber loves detective stories
. the novice detective
' s various misfortunes
, including him saying goodbye to his weepy mother
, are very funny
. unfortunately
, ther are flaws thta somewhat spoil bread
and tulips
' cheery tone
. rosalba is bothered by severeal surveill dreams during her time in venice
, which bring the movie to a halt
. it
' s like putting a gunfight in a nora ephron movie
. several details in fern
ando
' s life also never git proper closure
, including his suicidal tendencies
. early in the movie
, he nearly hangs himselv before rosalba knocks on his apartment door
. after that
, fern
ando
' s step towards death is never made reference to
, probably because soldini wanted to include a lukewarm
, underdeveloped subplot about fern
ando
' s stormy past
. it seems more like a desperate attempt to pump up the drama inwhich a plot that doesn
' t need any
.
but there aren
' t a lot of overwhelming negatives in bread
and tulips
. the movie is fun
and romantic
, iwth beautiful scenery
and characters whose lives we
' d like to live if we had the nerve
.
.
. or if our passports weren
' t missing
.
