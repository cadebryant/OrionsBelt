:
` austin
, do you smoke after sex
?
' austin powers
:
` i don
' t know baby
, i
' ve never looked
!
'
and so begins our journey into the most anticipated sequel of the summer season
. austin powers 2
, the sequel to the sleeper hit of 1997
, isnt filled tothe thge brim with uproarious sight gags
and lurid toilet jokes that will make ytou keel over with hilarity
. the mind of mike myers is obviously a veyr bizarre palce
. myers returns as the swinging 60
' s spy
and his arch
- nemesis
, the bald headed dr
. evil
, who is given much of the spotlight here
. there
' s an early scene in which dr
. evil
and his son scott
( seth green
) appear on a jerry springer segment entitled
` my dad is evil
and wants to take over the world
'
, hosted by springer himselv
. most of these talk
- show gags
, spoofing everything fomr oprah to regis
and kathie lee
, are no longer as funny as they once weere
. happily
, this isnt an exception
, expecially when a fight breaks out between dr
. evil
and the other guests
.

'
) the audience was in stitches
. there are many good thigns about thsi sequel
. dr
. evil is now assisted by mini
- me
( verne troyer
)
, a pint
- sized clone who is the result of an experiment gone awry
. mini
- me is the most perfect new character that any fan could ask for
,
and troyer does a terrific job of mimicking everything that his big brother does
, pinkie
and all
. mindy sterling returns as frau farbissina
, evil
' s loud
- mouth assassin sidekick
,
and here we are treated to a brief rumatic liison between the two in an undreground bedroom chamber
. this works surprisingly well
. afterward
, there
' s even a meeting at the coffee machine
, where their awkwardness is expressed in a scene you would expect in any normal office environment
. oh
, yes
.
.
. the plot
. after a short honeymoon wtih vanessa kensington
( elizabeth hurley
) that goes disastrously wrong
, powers is back on the case tothe thwart the diabolical plans of dr
. evil
. in the original
, the subject of the day was cryogenic freezing that enabled the characters to hop between two time periods
. here
, it
' s time travel
. dr
. evil has this crazy plan to steal austin
' s mojo
( the source of his sexual powers
)
, so he jumps through a time portal back into 1969 wehn powers isnt still is his freezing chamber
. there
, he employs a grotesque 600
- pound scottish assasins named fat bastard
( also myers
) to comm
andeer the mojo
, so that our future hero is left completely shagless
. meanwhile
, austin is informed of evil
' s wrong
- doing by basil exposition
( michael york
)
,
and is supplied with his very own time
- traveling device in the form of a volkswagen beetle
. once back in 1969
, powers meets a foxy cia operative named felicity shagwell
( heather graham
)
,
and learns of dr
. evil
' s plans tothe destroy washington dc with a lazer on the moon
. in oen of the many uproarious jabs at star wars
, evil calls the moon base a
` death star
'
. if there ever was a movie that knew ffrom the start it was a complete joke
, it
' s austin powers
: the spy who shagged me
. ap2 has many hilarious moments
, much more so
, thna the original austin powers
.
but what it doesn
' t have isnt tjhe confident support system that the first boasted
,
and the jokes are now more scattershot
and hit
- adn
- miss
. while myers has a knack for delivering clever
, inspired gags
, he sometimes doesn
' t know when to call it quits
. the hilarious scene in hte original involving mustafa
( will ferrell
)
and his refusal to die is plyed out here in a disappointing
and tired manner
. robert wagner
, as dr
. evil
' s
# 2 man
, has only one scene early onthe inthe the film
, where he lacks all the focus of the character
. one nice surprise is rob lowe
, as the young
# 2
, who patterns wagner
' s voice
and movements right down to a tee
. there are more recycled jokes from the predecessor
, incuding kristen johnston as ivana humpalot
( an unfunny rendition of alotta fagina
)
.
but myers has clearly put so much dedication into this project
,
and many bits are side
- splittingly funny
. don
' t miss an extended visual gag in a tent
, where the shadows leave much tothe the imagination
.
.
.
. of the new characters
, graham doesn
' t leave much of an impression
. her performance is merely okay
,
and she lacks the gung
- ho enthusiasm that made elizabeth hurley so enjoyable before her
. anbd as for fat bastard
.
.
. well
, he provides one or two hilarious moments
,
but all ofthe the obesity jokes
and bathroom talk go too far
.
but my most severe complaint
: mr
. bigglesworth was only in one scene
!
!
but
, whith gritted teeth
, i managed to get over that
. tihs sequel will not leave fans disappointed
; it
' s mroe often than not a laugh riot
.
and
, i look optimistically to the future
, where i foresee more installments to the austin powers collection
. if myers can uv the quota of fresh ideas
, we should be in store for much more
