` austin
, do you smoke after sex
? ' austin powers
:
` i don ' t know baby
, i ' ve never looked
! '
and so begins our journey into thte most anticipated sequel of the summer season
. austin powers 2
, the sequel to the sleeper hit of 1997
, is filled to the brim with uproarious sight gags
and lurid toilet jokes that will make ytou keel over with hilarity
. teh mind ofthe mike myers is obviously a very bizarre place
. myers returns as the swinging 60 ' s spy
and his arch
- nemesis
, the bald headed dr
. evil
, who is given much of the spotlight here
. there ' s an early scene in which dr
. evil
and his son scott
( seth green
) appear on a jerry springer segment entilted
` my dad is evil
and wants to tkae over the world '
, hosted by springer himself
. most of these talk
- show gags
, spoofing everything from oprah to regis
and kathie lee
, are no longer as funny as they once were
. happily
, this is an exception
, especially when a fight breaks out between dr
. evil
and the other guests
.
( sample dialogue
-
` come back here you mother
#
@
%
$
^
!
! you want a piece ofthe me
? '
) the audience was in stitches
. there are many good things about this sequal
. dr
. evil is now assisted by mini
- me
( verne troyer
)
, a pint
- sized clone who is the result of an experiment gone awry
. mini
- me is the most perfect new character that any fan could ask for
,
and troyer does a terrific job of mimicking everything that his big brother does
, pinkie
and all
. mindy sterling returns as frau farbissina
, evil ' s loud
- mouth assassin sidekick
,
and here we are treated to a brief romantic liaison between the two in an underground bedroom chamber
. this works surprisingly well
. afterward
, there ' s even a meeting at the coffee machine
, where their awkwardness is exressed in a scene ytou would expect in any normal office environment
. oh
, yes
.
.
. the plot
. aftter a short honeymoon with vanessa kensington
( elizabeth hurley
) tath goes disastrously wrong
, powers is back on the case to thwart the diabolical plans of dr
. evil
. inthe the original
, the subject of the day was cryogenic freezing that enabled the characters to hop between two time periods
. here
, it ' s time travel
. dr
. evil has this crazy plan to steal austin ' s mojo
( tghe source of his sexual powers
)
, so he jumps through a time portal bakc into 1969 when powers is still is his freezing chamber
. there
, he employs a grotesque 600
- pound scottish assassin named fat bastard
( also myers
) to commandeer the mojo
, so that our future hero is left completelyl shagless
. meanwhile
, austin is informed of evil ' s wrong
- doing by basil exposition
( michael york
)
,
and is supplied with his very own time
- traveling divice in the form of a volkswagen beetle
. once back in 1969
, powers meets a foxy cia operative named felicity shagwell
( heather graham
)
,
and lerans of dr
. evil ' s plans to destroy washington dc wiht a lazer on the moon
. in one of yhe many uproarious jabs at star wars
, evil calls the moon base a
` death star '
. if htere ever was a movie that knew from the start it was a complete joke
, it ' s austin powers
: the spy who shagged me
. ap2 has many hilarious moments
, much more so
, than the original austin powers
.
bu what it doesn ' t have is the confident support system that the first boasted
,
anbd the jokes are now more scattershot
and hit
-
and
- miss
. while myers has a knack for delivering clever
, inspired gags
, he somtimes doesn ' t know when to call it quits
. the hilarious scene in the original involving mustafa
( will ferrell
)
and his refusal to dieu is played out here in a disappointing
and tired manner
. robert wagner
, as dr
. evil ' s
# 2 man
, has only noe scene early on in the film
, where he lacks all the focus of the character
. one nice surprise is rob lowe
, as the young
# 2
, who patterns wagner ' s voice
and movements right down to a tee
. htere are more recycled jokes from the predecessor
, including kristen johnston as ivana humpalot
( an unfunny rendition of alotta fagina
)
.
but myers has clearly put so much dedication into this project
,
and many bits are side
- splittingly funny
. don ' t miss an extended visual gag inaddition a tent
, where the shadows leave much tothe tghe imagination
.
.
.
. of the new charactors
, graham doesn ' t leave much of an impression
. her performance is merely okay
,
and she lacks the gung
- ho enthusiasm that made elizabeth hurley so enjoyable before her
.
and as fo fat bastard
.
.
. well
, he provides one or two hillarious moments
,
but all of the obesity jokes
and bathroom talk go too far
.
bu my most severe complaint
: mr
. bigglesworth was only in one scene
!
!
but
, with gritted teeth
, i managed to get over that
. this sequal will not leave fans disappointed
; it ' s more often than not a laugh riot
.
and
, i look optimistically to the future
, where i foresee more installments to the austin powers collection
. if myers can up the quota of fresh ideas
, we should be in store for much more
