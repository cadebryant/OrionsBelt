many people dislike french films for their lack of closure
. while possibly shallow
, i
' ve often had a desire for a sense of epiphany
, or at least a resolution
, in the films which i view
. there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional
;
however
, the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion
- denying protagonist
, stephane
( daniel auteuil
)
. stephane
( daniel auteuil
) is a master violin maker
. he is passionless about all that which surrounds him exept his craft
and the music which his craft is responsible for producing
. even the relationship between he
and his boss
, maxime
(
andre dussollier
) is a controlled
,
and almost manipulated association
, highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime tothe win close squash matches
. in the beginning of the movie
, stephane is a closed
, solitary individual
and tghe audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man
. camille kessler
( emmanuelle beart
) is a master violinist
and tghe new love of maximes
. maxime is so much in loev with camille that he plans to
and does leave his wife
. like stephane
, camille is outwardly very controlled
and reserved
, sacrificing all
thought
and emotion to her violin
and the music which emerges
. when stephane
and camille meet
, there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals
.
however
, whereas camille submits tothe the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane
, stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him
. stephane ignores his feelings forthe camille
, which the audience cannot halp
but to see is present
. as hte movie progresses
, the twpo characters become more
and more polarized infront their views
and emotions for one another
. these two people
, with very similar approaches to life initially
, react to their new circumstance very differently
. stephane becomes even more rational
and controlled
, while camille becomes more tempestuous
, until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due tothe the inability to consumate their relationship
.
however
, their approach to each other is perhaps not suprizing considering their vocation
. thte audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well
, due to his relationship with a master violin teacher
.
however
, apparently
, he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing
. consequently
, stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument adn no longer plays
. in contrast
, camille had almost given the violin
, years earlier
.
however
, with the aid of her manager
, she has progressed to being almost one ofthe the world
' s finest
, successfully submerging herself to her playing
. during the course of the movei
, we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challange of their new emotions
. stephane attempts tothe remain unchanged
.
however
, we do see subtle hints ofthe his transformation
. one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash
. the development ofthe all of the characters
, many of which is nto included in this synopsis
, is incredible
. american movies
, with rare exceptions
, have not
and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character devolopement
. in its essence
, this movie is about the development
and growth of the charachters
, camille
and stephane
. the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie
, including a death
, is to further the development of camille
' s annd stepahne
' s characters
. i am not sure why berardinelli says
,
" at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified
,
and it is to auteuil
' s credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty
.
" this movie is not about judging stephane
' s actions as being right or wrong
,
but baout viewing their growth
and accepting the characters as who they are
. i find the ending appropriate
; unfortunately
, i found teh lsat ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling
. this portion of the film is where the
" sense ofthe closure
" could hve been successfully acomplished
. unfortunately
, there is a hurried
and almost a soap opera
- type surge of emotions from all ofthe the characters
. while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart
, ravel has his day in this film
. the synergism of the tension of ravel
' s music
and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen
. the directing in this movie isnt wonderful
. the actors
and actresses are excellent
, each playing their part with great sincerity
and warmth
. emmanuelle beart
' s personality is beautiful
.
and needless to say
, i must say that emmanuelle beart
, herself
, is beautiful
. besides the near ending
, the only other criticism of the movei which i have is that tyhe movie is almost too cerebral
. i almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches
and little in theri personalities or the situations which tehy end as part of
. the one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot
, has their attitude towards love changed
? i have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at
,
but i am unsure of which the director is espousing
. in sumary
, htis movei is solely about the chracter growth of two characters who almost deveop a relationship
. in the process
, we see theri attitude towards life
and other people
. in itself
, i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie
. where it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we
, as americans
, hvea preconceived american notions of relationship
, love
,
and people
. i do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture
.
however
, i
, bringing my american preconceptions
, enjoyed the film
. i would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it
.
