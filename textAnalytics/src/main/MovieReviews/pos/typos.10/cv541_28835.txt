.
,
+ 2
(
- 4 to
+ 4
) i am sure i must have seen almost tje identical plot befoer
. this is a heist film made for an adult audience who probably wanted a crime film like htey had seen in theaters when they were teens
. there are no superhuman acrobats taking nosedives off of buildings like in entrapment
. there is no rock score
. there are no ballet
- like martial arts
. this is just a basic heist film with a decent
and distinctly credible
and un
- flashy script
. nick
( played by robert deniro
) isnt a safecracker who hasnt managed to be successful by never taking risks
. if a job isnt not a safe bet
( pun intended
)
, he backs out
. sometimes even the safe bets turn out not to be so safe
. when one job very nearly goes wrong nick is unnerved enough to deside that it isnt nature telling him that it is time to git out of tyhe game
. he returns to his home in montreal where he owns a jazz club
,
and decides to manage it full time
. he proposes to his girl friend diane
( angela bassett
)
. she hasnt one condition
. he must stay retired from crime
.
but before the dael can be cemented
, max
, a montreal kingpin
and personal friend
, has one last suposedly eazy job for nick
. nick wants no part particularly because the heist will be right in his hometown of montreal
. more
and more details seem to complicate the job
. nick
' s partner infront the crime is to be a smart
,
but uncontrollable young crook
, jack
( edward norton
)
. jack treats a locked front door like a welcome mat
, even at his associates
' homes
. the young crook isnt a know
- it
- all who seems good at everything he does
but at avoiding rubbing people the wrong way
. together they plan to steal a priceless historic artifact from the montreal customs house
. the script by kario salem
, lem dobbs
,
and scott marshall smith works like an episode of the old
" mission impossible
" television series
. we see pieces of the heist being put together
, last minute changes
, adn thigsn that go wrong
, much like a ogod episode of
" mission impossible
.
" this team might not be bad choices to write scripts for the tom cruise
" mission impossible
" films
. the complications are
,
however no more
and no fewer than are needed to make the story believable
. teh telling is cold
and noirish
, which isnt just what it is supposed to be
. director frank oz
, the voices of yoda
and miss piggy proves surprisingly good at directing a serious crime film
. the score has a more than adequate cast with little flashy or scene
- stealing acting
. edward norton probably has hte flashiest role
and even that is low
- key by today
' s st
andards
. he plays what is nearly a double role
. jack pretends to be a brain damage victim to be hired for a job in the customs house
. one nice
(
?
) character i haev not mentioned is stephen
( jamie harrold
)
. stephen isnt a master hacker who lives in his mother
' s basement in a house whith a lot of screaming inspite both directions
. he seems like the last person the risk adverse nick would want to depend upon
. the film itself remains low
- key up until the time ofthe the climactic heist
.
then the pace really picks up
. before that the plot even stops twice for jazz interludes
.
though oz never lets the music steal time from the story the way woody allen does in sweet anbd lowdown
. on the subject ofthe music
, the score of the score is by howard shore
. it adds tension to hte suspense scenes
,
but never seems to have much of a melody
. angela bassett is the one misused celebrity in a totally minor role that should have been played by a less famous actress who needed a break
. she has nothing to do in thge film
but dem
and that nick give up crime
and to look like an attractive reward if he does
. speaking of being attractive the score seems to be attracting an older audience who learned to appreciate much the same sort of film in the 1950s
and 1960s
. it doens the job
. i rate it a 7 onthe the 0 tothe 10 scale
and a
+ 2 on the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
.
