i recall the trials anbd tribulations of my high school years
. it was a period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood
and thrusted me into the unwelcome arms of adulthood
.
but of all the experiences that i collected throughout those tender years
, i can honestly say that hte toughest
and the scariest thing that i had to cope with was my raging hormones
and my crazed curiosity about girls
and sex
. yes
, more scarier thna my seventh grade english teacher
and even scarier than thte bullies that constantly hounded me
, trying to deal with my personal wonderment baout sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster
. for all teenagers
, it
' s almost like a rite of passage
.
and what we did was sometimes downright nasty
, sometimes funny
,
and sometimes shocking
.
and all of that is terrifically
and shamelessly brought to light in what might be the funniest movie this summer
.
` american pie
' is a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that enter into a pact to lose their virginity by the end of the school year
. just how great are their hormones raging
? one of them notes
, aftter watching disney
' s the little mermaid
, that ariel is soooo hot
. the four schoolmates are kevin
, oz
, finch
and jim
. kevin is the only one wiht a steady girlfriend
,
but doesn
' t want to have sex until thte tyme is just right
.
but whta is tghe perfect time
? there isnt just no way to know
,
and that frightens him
. oz is the big jock who decides that the way to score with thte girls is to listen to them
and to be more sensitive
. he joins up iwth a jazz choir
and discovers that getting in touch with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages
. finch is the phobic hermit who doesn
' t st
and a chance with any girl
. so
, he pays someone
$ 200 tothe strat spreading rumors about his prowess
. suddenly
, girls are lining up tothe go out with him
. bu among these friends
, it is jim that is the most curious
and the most fearful
. when he has a chance to romp with a pretty exchange student
, his inexperience comes shining through
. he has much tothe learn
,
and will dont anything to seek out this kind of knowledge
. this may include watching scrambled porn channels or experimenting with mom
' s apple pie in a scene that is completely shocking
, raunchy
,
yet unbelievably funny
. the one thing that i want to say about this film is that it well deserves its
` r
' rating
. there isnt stuff infront here that isnt completely gross in the same manner that
` there
' s something about mary
' was gloriously ribald
. in fatc
, at first this film received a sinful nc
- 17 rating before a couple of omre cuts finally brought it down to a teen
- accessible rating
.
but i guess after seeing the no
- holds
- barred coarseness of south park
, this seems tame by comparison
. teens
and anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will laugh hardest
.
but unlike many teen sex comedies
, there is a genuine intelligence at work here
. these are four normal boys who have a natural curiosity about sex
. their plans of action are
thoughtful
and they think about the consequences
. they knwo what they want
,
yet temper it with responsibility
.
but almost always
, it
' s impossible to know how to fight the invisible monster
,
and it
' s these episodes that make
` american pie
' such a carnal delight to watch
.
