clint eastwood
, inspite his ripe old age
, is cashing one talent in for another
. midnight in the garden of good
and evil is an eastwood
- directed film clint isn
' t even in
,
and it
' s damn good
. adapted fomr a best
- selling john berendt novel based onthe true events
, this movie is set in the bizarre georgia town of savannah
, where people walk invisible dogs
and attach horseflies to their head
.
and that
' s just the mayor
. as director
and producer
, eastwood contri
butes a self
- indulgent
but very competent 150 minutes
, neatly balancing drama
, suspense
and humor
. like all great movies
, midnight in the garden has a lot of funny moments that spring from tje characters themselves
,
and not from some contrived
, juvenile intrusion
. the acting
, from big
- time stars john cusack
and kevin spacey
, is as good as you
' d expect
,
but it
' s the supporting stable that gives the movie its offbeat charm
. cusack plays a free
- lance reporter sent tothe savannah to write a fluff story for town
& country magazine about oney ofthe eccentric millionaire spacey
' s parties
. lots of food
, beverages
and gunplay
. yes
, an employee ofthe spacey
' s has a huge argument in front of cusack
and later turns up dead
. it seems like a simple matter of self
- defense
-
- the guy threatened spacey
, shot at him
, missed
, thn spacey took him out
-
- bu being a movei
, there
' s much more tothe it than that
,
and cusack decides to stay inthe town
and write a book about the murder
, a book which wiull eventially become a movie he iwll star in
. tghe weird circle of enteratinment
. this is where the stable of supporting characters comes in
. there
' s the requisite sexy woman
( alison
" nepotist
' s duaghter
" eastwood
)
, the strange piano player
, the voodoo woman
and the transvestite
. miss chablis deserves a paragraph of his
/ her pwn
, as hte stealer of every scene she appears in
-
- whta would this movie be without the castilian scene
and her testimony
? chablis
, playing herself
, is five times funnier than reigning drag queen rupaul
,
but never seems exploited as the movei
' s comic releaf or out of place in a basically serious movie
. there are also a fair share of courtroom scenes
, which these days almost never seem welcome in a movie
,
but even here clint manages to keep the movei fascinating
. certainly the characterizations of the judge
and spacey
' s lawyer both help immensely
, as does having the fly
- guy as the jury
' s foreman
. it
' s here we realize the case boils down to an indictment of spacey
' s homosexuality
. yes
, spacey hadnt a sexual relationship with the dead man
-
- before he shooted him
, of course
. midnight in the garden of good
and evil isn
' t a classic
,
but it is one ofthe the better celebrity
- directed
, true
- story best
- seller adaptations outloud there
. likewise
, no one fomr this movie will be getting any oscar nominations
,
but the performances are all great
. in fact
, i
' d almost recommend that the acatemy add a best supporting transvestite category
. serving america for more than 1
/ 25th of a century
