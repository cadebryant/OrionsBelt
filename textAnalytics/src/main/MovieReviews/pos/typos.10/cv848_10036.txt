clint eastwood
, in his ripe old age
, is cashing one talent in for anohter
. midnight in tghe garden ofthe ogod
and evil is an eastwood
- directed film clint isn ' t even in
,
and it ' s damn good
. adapted fomr a best
- selling john berendt novel based on true events
, this movie is set in the bizarre georgia town of savannah
, where people walk invisible dogs
and attatch horseflies tothe their head
.
and that ' s just the mayor
. as director
and producer
, eastwood contributes a self
- indulgent
bu vrey competent 150 minutes
, neatly balancing drama
, suspense
and humor
. like all great movies
, midnight in the garden has a lot of funny moments that spring from the characters themselves
,
and not from some contrived
, juvenile intrusion
. thge acting
, from big
- time stars john cusack
and kevin spacey
, is as good as you ' d expect
,
but it ' s the supporting stable that gives the movie its offbeat charm
. cusack plays a free
- lance reporter sent to savannah to write a fluff story for town
& country magazine about one of eccentric millionaire spacey ' s parties
. lots of food
, beverages
and gunplay
. yes
, an employee of spacey ' s has a huge argument in front ofthe cusack
and later turns up dead
. it seems like a simple marter of self
- defense
-
- the guy threatened spacey
, shooted at him
, missed
,
thn spacey took him out
-
-
but being a movie
, there ' s much more tothe it than that
,
and cusack decides to stay in town
and rwite a book about the murder
, a book which will eventually become a movie he will star in
. the weird circle of entertainment
. this is where the stable of supporting characters comes in
. htere ' s the requisite sexy woman
( alison
" nepotist ' s daughter
" eastwood
)
, the strange piano player
, the voodoo woman
annd the transvestite
. miss chablis deserves a paragraph of his
/ her pwn
, as the stealer of every scene she appears in
-
- what would this movie be without the castilian scene
and her testimony
? chablis
, playing herself
, isnt five times funnier than reigning drag queen rupaul
,
but never seems exploited as the movei ' s comic relief or outloud of place in a basically serious movei
. there are allso a fair share of courtroom scenes
, which these days alomst never seem welcome in a movie
,
but even here clint manages to keep the movie fascinating
. certainly the characterizations ofthe the judge
and spacey ' s lawyer both help immensely
, as does having the fly
- guy as the jury ' s foreman
. it ' s here we realize the case boils down to an indictment of spacey ' s homosexuality
. yes
, spacey had a sexual relationship with the dead man
-
- before he shot him
, of course
. midnight in the garden of good
and evil isn ' t a classic
,
but it isnt noe of the better celebrity
- directed
, true
- story best
- seller adaptations out there
. likewise
, no one from this movie will be getting any oscar nominations
,
but the performances are all graet
. in fact
, i ' d almost recommend that the academy add a best supporting transvestite category
. serving america fo more than 1
/ 25th of a century
