in this good natured
, pleasent
and easy gonig comedy
, bill murray
( ghostbusters
, 1984
) plays grumpy weatherman phil conners
, who
, every yera
, is sent to punxsutawney
, p
. a
, to report on groundhog day
. the groundhog day ceremony involves a groundhog being lefted out of a box
,
adn if he dosen ' t see a shadow
, it will be an early spring
. phil really hates the ceremony
,
and not even his producer rita
( macdowell
) can change his mind
.
however
, fate has a cruel trick fo phil
,
and he starts re
- living groundhog day over
,
and over
,
and over
, until he gradually likes it
,
and rita falls in love with him
. groundhog day is a well wroten
, totatly unoffensive
and funny comedy
. the screenwriters
, director ramis
and danny rubin
, have written a funny
, warm
,
but never overly senitmental comedy
.
although the idea of a day repeating over
and over may sound tedious
, there are enough good jokes to hold the audiences attention throughout the whole film
. ramis ' s direction alsot helps
,
and
although he dosen ' t try any flash director tricks
, the film is directed well enough
,
and the jokes are set up well
.
and the editing is also good
, especially whn it shows one part of the day over
,
and over again
, such as whn phil trys to have the perfect night with rita
. the performances are allso exelent
. bill murray is great fun
,
and his transistion from cynical to happy is smooth
,
and delivers his lines in his usual smary style
. andie macdowell is good as rita
,
although sometimes she is just a little bit too sweet in some parts of the film
. there is chemestry between the two leads
, thankfully
, otherwise the whole film would probably fall part
. chris elliot
, as the cameraman larry
, isnt aslo funny
,
although you have to like his goofy style
, otherwise you are really going to hate him throughout this film
,
and it will lower your enjoyment of the film overall
. the supporting cast aren ' t bad either
, with stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils old school mate ned ryanson
,
and even director ramis popping up as a neurologist
. in fact
, there is not oen dud performance in this film
,
annd even the groundhog gets a funny scene involving a car chase
. overall
, there is really nothing wrong with groundhog day at all
. it almost seems perfect
.
howver
, thte film can get a bit soppy sometimes
,
annd some people may get irritated by the day repeating over
,
and over
,
anbd over
,
and over
. also
, there ' s not much of an music score
,
and the music there is is pretty bad
.
but these criticisms hardly affect the audiences enjoyment at all
. overall
,
then
, groundhog day is a funny
, smart
,
and also has smoe room in there forthe some heart
. an exelent comedy
. overall rating
