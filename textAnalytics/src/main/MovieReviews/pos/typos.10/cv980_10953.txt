infact this good natured
, pleasent
and easy going comedy
, bill murray
( ghostbusters
, 1984
) plays grumpy weatherman phil conners
, who
, every year
, is sent to punxsutawney
, p
. a
, to report on groundhog day
. the groundhog day ceremony involves a groundhog being lifted out ofthe a box
,
and if he dosen
' t see a shaddow
, it will be an early spring
. phil really hates the ceremony
,
and not even his producer rita
( macdowell
) can change his mind
.
however
, fate has a cruel trick for phil
,
and he starts re
- living groundhog day over
, adn over
,
and over
, unil he gradually likes it
,
and rita falls in love with him
. groundhog day is a well written
, totatly unoffensive
and funny comedy
. tghe screenwriters
, director ramis
and danny rubin
, have written a funny
, warm
,
but never overly senitmental comedy
.
al
though the idea of a day repeating over
and over may sound tedious
, there are enough good jokes to hold the audiences attention throughout the whole film
. ramis
' s direction also helps
,
and all
though he dosen
' t try any flash director tricks
, the film is directed well enough
,
and tjhe jokes are set up well
.
and the editing is also good
, especially whn it shows one part of the day over
,
and over again
, such as whn phil tries to have the perfect night with rita
. the performances are also excellent
. bill murray is great fun
,
and his transistion from cynical to happy is smooth
, adn delivers his lines in his usual smary style
.
andie macdowell is good as rita
,
al
though sometimes she is just a little bit too sweet in some parts of the film
. there is chemistry between the two leads
, thankfully
, otherwise the whole film would probably fall part
. chris elliot
, as the cameraman larry
, is also funny
,
al
though you have to like his goofy style
, otherwise you are really going to hate him throughout this film
,
and it iwll lower your enjoyment of thge film overall
. the supporting cast aren
' t bad either
, with stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils old school mate ned ryanson
,
and even director ramis popping uv as a neurologist
. inaddition fatc
, there is not one dud performance in this film
,
and even the groundhog gets a funny scene involving a car chase
. overall
, htere isnt really nothing wrong with groundhog day at all
. it almost seems perfect
.
however
, the film can get a bit soppy somtimes
,
and some people may get irritated by the day repeating over
,
and over
,
and over
,
and over
. also
, there
' s nto much of an music score
,
and teh music there is is pretty bad
.
but theese criticisms hardly affect the audiences enjoyment at all
. overall
,
then
, groundhog day is a funny
, smart
,
and also has soem room in there for some heart
. an excellent comedy
. overall rating
