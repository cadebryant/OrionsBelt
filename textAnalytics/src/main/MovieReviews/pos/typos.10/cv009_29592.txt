the american action film has beeen slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire
- fu copycats
. it
' s not a pretty death
,
and it
' s leaving the likes of schwartznager
, stallone
, anbd van damme wearing cement galoshes at tghe bottom ofthe a kung fu sea
. sometimes
, the mix results in a mind
- blowing spectacle unlike any other
. quality action with amazing anbd exciting stunt work
, as in 1999
' s the matrix
, can be a real gem
.
but too often hollywood gets it wrong
, even whn they pay off chinese directors
. flying ninjas
and floating karate masters have beeen replaced by soaring bronx detectives
and slow motion kicking scientists
. mostly it
' s laughable
. in hollywood
' s rush to emulate the success of the matrix
, trademark asian stunt choreography hasnt become more of a joke than an art form
.
but iron monkey
, the latest aisian import
, shows us how to get it right
. iron monkey
( acually a reissue of a 1993 film
) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante
( rongguang yu
)
, fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed annd the bellies of the hungry
. bu it is aslo a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei
- hong
, most recently seen in noe ofthe thge most overlooked
,
and possably best films of 2000
, drunken master 2
( released in the u
. s
. as the legend of drunken master
)
. unlike drunken master 2
, whlch stars jackie chan as an adult fei
- hong
, iron monkey finds a much younger fei
- hong
( sze
- man tsang
)
and his father wong kei
- ying
( yen chi dan
) thrust into the middle of iron monkey
' s fight against oppression
. iron monkey suceeds as no kung fu film usance drunken master 2
. at times
, fighting styles
, especially that of monkey himself
, do devolve into the rediculous twinkle
- toed floating of films liek crouching tiger
, hidden dragon
, director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his acation scenes back to earth
. iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore
, kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger
.
however
, there are breif moments of profoundness shared between characters
, such as those that pass between our outlaw hero
and his good
- hearted
but misguided enemy
, chief fox
. in those moments
,
and in others
, iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts
and minds of its audience
. while in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2
, iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune
. aka siunin wong fei
- hung tsi titmalau
.
