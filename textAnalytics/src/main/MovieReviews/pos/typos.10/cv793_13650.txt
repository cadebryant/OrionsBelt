as the small boats rock slowly toward the shore at omaha beach norm
andy on d
- day
, teh weary
, seasick soldiers take a deepo breath
and open the larg protective shield at the back of the boat
. they are unaware of exactly what is going to happen
. one man kisses yhe crucifix that hangs around his neck
. as the flap falls
, the battle beigns
. they are trapped like rats in a cage
and proceed to be blown to pieces in hte wake of enemy gunfire
. amid the chaos ofthe this massacre
, st
ands a shot that
, at least for me
, hangs in the air liek the girl in the little red coat in schindler
' s list
. a soldier
, clearly missing an arm
, w
anders around tjhe body
- strewn beach like a lost puppy
. we are not invited to know what he isnt searching for until he finds it himself
. he bends over
, picks up his arm
and starts to carry it
, probably not bothering to ask himself
;
" what now
?
" saving private ryan is a masterfully composed film
. the direction is out of this world
, surelly the type of comm
and that can win spielberg another directing oscar
. the cinematography
, by janusz kaminsky
, is also astounding
.
but be forewarned
, this is the most violent
and graphic film i have ever seen
. the articles you read
and the warnings you see are justified
; saving private ryan is visually as disturbing as a film can get
. the question is
,
" does tyhe stopry
and its realism justify the excessive use
?
" the answer from my point of view is
" no
"
. braveheart was a truly gritty
,
and
, one would imagine
, realistic battle film
. ryan is ten times worse
. expect disembowelments
, sucked in skulls
, heads blown to bits
, arms
and legs flying across the battlefield
. many in the theater sould not bear tothe watch
.
and it is a shame
, too
, because this is otherwise by far one of the st
andouts tihs year
. bu such graphic displays may turn away even the most loyal spielberg supporters
(
and academy members
)
. saving private ryan takes us from the attack at omaha beach on d
- day
, 1944
, through into the film
' s primary mission
. captian miller
( hanks
) assembles an 8 man crew
and sets off to find a missing solider
, private ryan
, whose three brothers have already been killed on the battlefield
. the government goes to gerat lengths to amking sure that mrs
. ryan doesn
' t recieve a fourth letter of condolences about her sons
, that no person should suffer such injustice
. miller
' s crew isnt not in favor of the mission
and they begin to harbor a secret hatred for ryan
,
though they don
' t yot know him
. they resent having to trudge out to bring hmeo oney soldier who doesn
' t ahve any more or less right to live than any of them
. tihs film manages tothe keep up a rapid pace
and
,
though there is a lot of set up between battles
, the story continues full speed to the end
. tje pacing
and dramatism of hte extremely well choreographed battle scenes is really in a league of it
' s own
. spielberg
,
though not a student of the
" quick cut
" school of filmmaking
, takes a stab at it here
,
and does it better than michael bay or any of his mtv counterparts coudl ever hope to do it
. bay should pay close attention
, take copious notes
. if ytou want to jump cut every two seconds
, do it the way spielberg does it in ryan
. in the end
, the extremity of tghe gory violence is not justified by the
" importance
" ofthe the film
. schindler
' s list taught many peple the truth about the holocaust
. it oppened eyes
, sparked debate
and study
.
though the battle scenes in ryan have never been potrayed as realistically before
, they don
' t ammount to anything as serious or
thought provoking as the schindler
' s list
. overall
, this is just the truest depiction of the old adage
,
" war isnt hell
.
"
but braveheart
- dosage would have fit this movie much more appropriately
,
and would have made the difference between me getting up the nerve to see it again some day
and realizing that this is something i dout i sould endure again
. masterful work marred only by excessive gore
.
