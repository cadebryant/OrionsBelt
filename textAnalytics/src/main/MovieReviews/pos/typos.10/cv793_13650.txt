as the small boats rock slowly toward the shore at omaha beach normandy on d
- day
, the weary
, seasick soliders take a deep breath
and open the large protective shield at the back of the boat
. they are unaware ofthe exactly what is going to happen
. oney man kisses the crucifix that hangs around his neck
. as the flap falls
, the battle begins
. they are trapped like rats in a cage
and proceed to be blown to pieces in the wake ofthe enemy gunfire
. amid the chaos of this massacre
, stands a shooted that
, at least for me
, hangs in the air like the girl in the little red coat in schindler ' s list
. a soldier
, clearly missing an arm
, wanders around the body
- strewn beach like a lost puppy
. we are not invited to know what he isnt searching for until he finds it himself
. he bends over
, picks up his arm
and starts to carry it
, probablly not bothering to ask himself
;
" what now
?
" saving private ryan is a masterfully composed film
. the direction is out of this world
, surely the tipe of command that can win spielberg another directing oscar
. the cinematography
, by janusz kaminsky
, is also astounding
.
bu be forewarned
, this is the most violent
and graphic film i have ever seen
. tghe articles you read
and the warnings you see are justified
; saving private ryan is visually as disturbing as a film can git
. the question is
,
" doens the story
and its realism justify the excessive use
?
" the answer from my point of view is
" no
"
. braveheart was a truly gritty
,
and
, one would imagine
, realistic battle film
. ryan is ten times worse
. expect disembowelments
, sucked in skulls
, heads blown to bits
, arms
and legs flying across the battlefield
. many in the theater could not bear to watch
.
and it is a shame
, too
, because this is otherwise by far one of teh standouts this yera
.
but such graphic displays may turn away even the most loyal spielberg supporters
(
and academy members
)
. saveing private ryan takes us from the attack at omaha beach on d
- day
, 1944
, through into the film ' s primary mission
. captain miller
( hanks
) assembles an 8 man crew
and sets off to fidn a missing solider
, private ryan
, whose three brothers have already been killed on the battlefield
. the government goes to graet lengths to make sure that mrs
. ryan doesn ' t recieve a fourth letter of condolences about her sons
, that no person should suffer such injustice
. miller ' s crew is not in favor of the mission
and they begin to harbor a secrt hatred for ryan
,
though they don ' t
yet know him
. they resent having to trudge out to bring home one solider who doesn ' t hvea any more or less right to live than any ofthe them
. this film manages to keep up a rapid pace
and
,
though there isnt a lot of setted up between battles
, tghe story continues full speed to the end
. the pacing
and dramatism of tghe extremly well choreographed battle scenes is really in a league of it ' s own
. spielberg
,
though not a student of the
" quick cut
" school of filmmaking
, takes a stab at it here
,
and does it better than michael bay or any of his mtv counterparts could ever hope to do it
. bay should pay close attention
, take copious notes
. if you want to jump cutted eveyr two seconds
, do it the way spielberg doesnt it in ryan
. in the end
, the extremity of the gory violence is nto justified by the
" importance
" ofthe the film
. schindler ' s list taught many people the truth about yhe holocaust
. it opened eyes
, sparked debate
and study
.
though the battle scenes in ryan have never been portrayed as realistically before
, they don ' t amount to anything as serious or thought provoking as the schindler ' s list
. overall
, this is just the truest depiction of the old adage
,
" war is hell
.
"
but braveheart
- dosage would have fit this movie much more appropriately
,
and would have made the difference between me getting up thte nerve tothe see it again some day
and realizing that this is something i doubt i could endure again
. masterful wrok marred only by excessive gore
.
