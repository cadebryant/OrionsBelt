will hunting
( matt damon
) is a natural genius
. for a movie character
, that
' s usually a death sentence
. it
' s a trait associated with what my brother calls
" too good for this world
" movies
, like phenomenon or powder
. foregive me forthe spoiling the ending
,
but will doesn
' t die
. this is no forumla movie
. in fact
, it
' s quite fresh
and original
. it
' s a character study more than anything
,
and that
' s not surprising
, considering it wass written by two actors
: damon
and co
- star ben affleck
. will works whatever kind of job he can get
. first he
' s a janitor
,
then he works construction
. off
- screen he speed reads books on any accademic subject that interests him
. on
- screen he hangs out with his friends
, picking fights in robust
, romanticized
- hemingway fashion
. lambeau
( stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves
)
, a math professor
, learns that the janitor
( will
) is a genius with a special talent for advanced mathematics
. having confirmed he
' s not a fluke or a savant
, he does what he can to get will into the education sytem
. he is firmly rejected
. finally
, will l
ands in jail for one of his fights
. lambeau can git him probation instead of prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions
and to discusting mathematics with him
. will
( barely
) decides to go for the therapy over prison
. lambeau treats will like a son
. he
' s proud of
, anbd amazed by
, will
' s accomplishments inthe mathematics
. he encourages will
and tries to give him structure
, knowing that
, with a little discipline
, he could be bigger than einstein
. will isn
' t really interested in academia
. he knows he woudl be the best in his feeld
,
and therefore spend all of his time in an office
, explaining math to people like lambeau
. he would rather work construction
, which breaks lambeau
' s heart
. meanwhile
, will attends his m
andated therapy sessions
. it
' s not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeau
' s
" a
" list
. will has read enough pyschology to know yhe tricks of the trade
,
and how to keep them from affecting him
. shrink after shrink refuses to return after iwll
' s mockery
. lambeau
' s last hope is his old college roommate
, now a psychology teacher at a small
- time community college
. knowing that wiull is going to try to shred him too
, sean
( robin williams
) agrees to take him onthe as a favor to lambeau
and for the chance to meet tihs next einstein
. true tothe form
, will finds sean
' s emotional weakness
and attacks
.
but unlike the other shrinks
, sean knows wqat he is in for
and continues the sessions
. like a foster mother with a fussy child
, sean knows tath the attacks are defensive
and is able to take them in stride
. like the foster mother
, sean knows that time
and quiet patience is the only approach
. robin williams is excellent in this role
. he
' s not an actor with a great range
,
but in the right roles he has great depth
. in thsi movie
, as in awakenings
, there comes a point when tjhe quiet
, shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance
,
and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes
. williams is the only actor i can nmae who can make an audience cry just by smiling
. i hve compared will to a foster child
and thyat
' s nto entirely fair
. emotionally
, he has a lot to leran
, bu he is nto a child
. he has
thought about his life
and made rational decisions about what he wants
. sean
, his girlfriend
, his pals
,
and lambeau all help him grow
,
but he didn
' t start out asking for
, or particularly needing
, help
. his exceptional gift singled him out
,
and those who lveo him kept pushing him in the right direction
. if i had to say anything bad about ogod will hunting is that it walks the line between drama
and melodrama
. it
' s too sentimental
and uplifiting for a straight drama
,
but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama
. it is emotionally engaging
,
but it
' s not quite larger tahn life
. this isn
' t a problem per se
,
but at times i didn
' t know quite how to take it
.
but this is a relatively small complaint about a very good movie
. a ogod movie allows its characters to learn
and grow
. it doesn
' t just happen
; it takes a good scirpt
, good acting
,
and good direction
. good will hunting has all three
. if you are at all inclined to see it
, by all means
, go
.
