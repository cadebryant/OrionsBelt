will hunting
( matt damon
) is a natrual genius
. for a movie character
, that ' s usually a death sentence
. it ' s a trait associated with what my brother calls
" too good for this world
" movies
, like phenomenon or powder
. forgive me for spoiling the ending
,
but will doesn ' t die
. this isnt no formula movie
. in fact
, it ' s quite fresh
and original
. it ' s a character study more than anything
,
and that ' s not surprising
, considering it was writed by two actors
: damon
and co
- star ben affleck
. will works whatever kind of job he can get
. first he ' s a janitor
,
then he works construction
. off
- screen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him
. on
- screen he hangs out with his friends
, picking fights in robust
, romanticized
- hemingway fashion
. lambeau
( stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves
)
, a math professor
, learns that the janitor
( will
) is a genius with a special talent for advanced mathematics
. having confirmed he ' s nto a fluke or a savant
, he does what he can to get will into the education system
. he is firmly rejected
. finally
, will lands in jail for one of his fights
. lambeau can get him probation instead of prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions
and to discussing mathematics with him
. will
( barely
) decides to go forthe the therapy over prison
. lambeau treats will like a son
. he ' s proud of
,
and amazed by
, will ' s accomplishments in mathematics
. he encourages iwll
and tries to give him structure
, knowing tyhat
, with a little discipline
, he could be bigger than einstein
. will isn ' t really interested in academia
. he knows he would be the best inaddition his field
,
and therefore spend all of his time in an office
, explaning math to people like lambeau
. he woudl rather work construction
, whcih breaks lambeau ' s heart
. meanwhile
, will attends his mandated therapy sessions
. it ' s not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeau ' s
" a
" list
. will has read enough psychology to know thge tricks of the trade
,
adn how to keep them from affecting him
. shrink after shrink refuses to return after will ' s mockery
. lambeau ' s last hope is his old college roommate
, now a psychology teacher at a small
- time community college
. knowing thast will is going to try to shred him too
, sean
( robin williams
) agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau
and for the chance to meet this next einstein
. true to form
, will finds sean ' s emotional weakness
and attacks
.
but unlike tjhe other shrinks
, sean knows what he is in for
and continues the sessions
. like a foster mother with a fussy child
, sean knows that the attacks are defensive
and isnt able tothe take them in stride
. like the foster mother
, sean knwos that time
and quiet patience is the onyl aproach
. robin williams is excellent in this role
. he ' s not an actor with a great range
,
but in the right roles he has great depth
. in this movei
, as in awakenings
, there comes a point when the quiet
, shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance
,
and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes
. williams is the onyl actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling
. i hve compaired will to a foster child
and that ' s not entirely fair
. emotionally
, he has a lot to leran
,
but he is not a child
. he has thought about his life
annd made rational decisions about waht he wants
. sean
, his girlfriend
, his pals
,
and lambeau all help him grow
,
but he didn ' t start out asking for
, or aprticularly needing
, help
. his exceptional gitf singled him out
,
annd those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction
. if i had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walks the line between drama
adn meledrama
. it ' s too sentimental
and uplifiting for a straight drama
,
bu the emotions are too subtle for melodrama
. it is emotionally engaging
,
bu it ' s not quite larger than life
. tihs isn ' t a problem per se
,
but at times i didn ' t know qutie how tothe take it
.
but this is a relatively small complaint about a very good movei
. a good movie allows its characters to learn
and grow
. it doesn ' t just happen
; it takes a good script
, good acting
,
and good direction
. good will hunting has all three
. if you are at all inclined to see it
, by all means
, go
.
