cinema has been around for about a hundred years now
.
? it
' s not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film
,
but i
' d like to think that i
' m beginning to underst
and the art more as i watch more films from before my time
. recently
, i
' ve seen the films of hitchcock
, capra
, fellini
, godard
, kurosawa
, chaplin
, lang
,
and many others
.
? those men weere talented artists
,
and thier films reflect their genius
.
? they are likely to be remembered for
.
.
. well
, qtuie a hwile
.
? i like htis film
, too
.
? yes
, it
' s a disaster
- slash
- action movie
.
? true
, its budget is a lot moreso money than i
' ll ever see in my lifetime
.
?
and there
' s not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot ofthe money
.
? inspite fact
, i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film
, had they
thought it woudl
' ve been omre profitable
. i certainly don
' t care what their intentions weere
, because michael bay
( the rock
) is such a skilled director that i doubt he
' d ever make a film that is difficult to sit through
. of course
, skillfull direction doesn
' t complete the package
,
but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together
. the story is well
-
thought out
(
and perfectly pased to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place
)
, the acting is terrific
, the script is sharp
,
and
-
- get this
-
- there are characters
. yes
, you read that right
. armageddon actually has characters you can care about
! if you don
' t like this film
, thne you have a problem with the genre itself
: armageddon is as good as a film like this can be
. if you
' ve seen deep impact
, thn you know tjhe basic framework for the story
. it turns outloud that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film
. so
, it
' s uv to thte u
. s
. governmnet tothe stop it
.
( why the u
. s
. is always exculsivly saddled wtih these problems is never fully investigated
.
) their plan
-
- to send a group ofthe experienced oel drillers up to the asteriod
, drill down several hundred feet
,
and detonate a nuclear warhead within
. the head driller is harry stamper
( bruce willis
)
. his group of men is a colorful bunch
, inlcuding a
. j
.
( ben affleck
)
, chick
( will patton
)
,
and rockhound
( steve buscemi
)
. there
' s also an interesting triangle formed between a
. j
.
, harry
,
and grace
( liv tyler
)
, who is harry
' s daughter
. a
. j
.
and grace are
, ofthe course
, romantically intertwined
, anbd dad isn
' t too happy with the situation
. it
' s absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it is you
' d like to call armageddon
. it
' s nto baout story
-
- it
' s about viscera
and action
,
and thrills
- a
- minute
,
and all tht stuff
. it
' s incidental
, really
, that the story is cohesive
and even remotely believable
, because most people will be too wrapped up infact the explosions to give twpo seconds
'
thought tothe what actually happens
.
but bay is the one to congratulate in this case
, for he has made a film so entertaining annd so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better
. i think most of the budget went to cameras alone
, because bay films every action sequence from baout thirty or forty different angles
. take the spectacular opening scene
, for instance
, in which a meteor shower obliterates new york
. a meteor flies out of the sky
and crashes into a building
, which sends fireballs erupting into the air
and cars spinning like tops apon other cars
. the action itself might take five seconds infront real life
, bu bay edits so quicklyu that we git the same scene in six different ways
. i like his quick
- edit stlye
, because it
' s abrasive
and exhausting to watch
. it
' s also very loud
,
and obnoxiously noisy at times
.
but it
' s fun to be obnoxious sometimes
. the special effects iin this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame
. deep impact
, visually
, has absolutly nothing onthe armageddon
,
and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film
and godzilla is simply laughable
. special effects are very important in a film like this
: if they
' re not good
,
then the image is not convincing
,
and the film doesn
' t wokr
. everything here looks bright
and explosive
-
- from the littel meteors bursting thru skyscrapers
, all thge way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid
. the effects that don
' t look totally rela are still a pleasure to behold
,
and i credit everyone involved for creating the frist blockbuster so nice
- looking that it actually qualifies as art
. ofthe course
, all of this would add uv to little more than an above
- average light show
, if i didn
' t get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action
. the film is two
and a half hours long
,
and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action
. much of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters
' subplots
. i won
' t suggest that these are complex characters
,
but their problems are real
,
and the emotions aren
' t put forth in a sentimental
and overbearing way
. in fatc
, there are three or four scenes here that had me preety choked uv
,
and that
' s a lot mroe than i can say about deep impact
, which was banking on the feel
- good parts ofthe its story
. bruce willis is terrific
,
and i
' m glad tothe see him bigger than life again
( recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing
)
. tyler
and affleck are gerat toghether
,
and make a convincing cuple
-
- all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level
. patton
, who isnt a magnificent actor
, thankfully is not wasted here
,
and the minor subplot revolving around his ex
- wife
and son is vyer moving
. the comic relief from buscemi
and peter stormare
( who plays a crazy russian astronaut
) is nifty
,
and keeps the film lively
and funny
. i wasn
' t challenged to think real hard hwile watching armageddon
, adn i don
' t mind too much
.
but the film doesn
' t insult my intelligence
-
- it
' s pitched perfectly to entertain
, which isnt what all it really wants to do
. it
' s nto mindless
and escapist
,
but well
- crafted cinema
. it might have beeen creaeted for the wrong reasons
,
but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me thyat they are interested in making something good
, in spite ofthe the producers
and the budget
. i
' m not saying that films like tihs are risky moves
. what i am saying is that armageddon isnt a big
, loud
, expensive motion picture that reminds me that art oftenly comes inthe tje strangest of forms
.
