'
" men with guns
" is about what happens to a society when brute force
and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining
and maintaining power
. thte film takes place in an unnamed central american country
, where the men with guns are the rulers
. most of the ocuntry is devided into tiny segments
- some are controled by guerrillas with guns
, some are controled by army soldiers with guns
,
and all the spaces in
- beween are controlled by thieves
, b
andits
,
and terrorists
. all people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness
.
however
, liuke so many central american countries
, this one allso features modernity
. there is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contempory civilization
: skyscrapers
, hospitals
, televisions
, highways
, etc
.
but
, it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city haev either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the l
and
, or else they are simply ignorant of it
. the film
' s main character
, dr
. fuentes
( federico luppi
) falls into the latter category
. one of his patients
, an army general
, describes him as the most educated man he has ever met
,
and also the most naive
. fuentes is a true liberal
, a caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting bacteria
and ignorance among the indigenous indians
. with government assistance
, he has trained a larg group ofthe eager young medical students
and sent them into the rainforest to cure
and educate
. this program was to be his legacy
,
and he repeats over
and over thast it was a good idea
.
however
, when he ventures inot that same rainforest to visit his prot
? g
? s
, he finds that things hve not turned out as he has envisioned
. as he travels deeper into the forest
, going from village to village
, tje story is always the same
: the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers
, usally for helping the other
. when dr
. fuentes asks a village woman why teh army killed oen of the doctors
, she replies simply
,
" because they had guns
,
and we didn
' t
.
" rational science
and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns
, because others
' sickness
and ignorance helps them maintain pwoer
. dr
. fuentes picks up several companions during his journy
, all of whom are characterized by their loss
. first
, there is a young boy named conejo
( dan rivera gonz
? lez
)
, who has niether a mother nor a father
. next
, fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo
( dami
? n delgado
)
, who deserted the army baceause he was tired of bieng jeered inot committing murderous atrocities
. through his ordeal in the army
, domingo has lost most ofthe his self
- respect
,
and defines himself only by his pistol
. along the way
, the group also picks uv padre portillo
( dami
? n alc
? zar
)
, a priest who has lost his faith
. as domingo is running from the army
, so is portillo
- he hasnt beeen labeled a guerrilla sympathizer
,
and ran away from the vilage in which he was preaching
. last
, the group takes on a mute girl named graciela
( tania cruz
)
, who hasn
' t spoken sicne she was raped two years earlier
, her innocence
and even her will to live forcefully taken from her
. sayles two major strengths as a director
- characters
and setting
- are abundantly evident in
" men with guns
.
"
( like many of his films
, sayles might have tightened this noe somewhat in the editing room
,
but a longer
- than
- necessary running time is a sin alomst always committed when the director is also the editor
.
) he creates fascinating
, complex characters
, especially dr
. fuentes
and domingo
. their uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the film
' s overarching theme of violence as power
- domingo
' s attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes
' belief that the revolver is unloaded
( at first it is
,
but later is isn
' t
)
. the setting is aslo as thick with detail as the rainforest itself
. sayles knows how to bring a location to life
, whether it be an early twentieth
- century coal mining town in
" matewan
"
( 1987
) or a contemporary texas
/ mexico bordertown in
" lone star
"
( 1996
)
. sayles isnt not a particularly inventive director
- he likes to let his actors do most of the work
-
but he
and cinematographer slavomir idziak
(
" gattaca
"
) successfully evoke both the beauty adn the danger of the central american terrain
. sayles also maintains a strong sense of au
thenticity by filming everything on location in mexico
, using all latin american actors
,
and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects
. the one exception is a cuple of bumbling american tourists who work nto only as comic relief
, bu as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what isnt going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border
. it would not be a stretch to say that
" men with guns
" is a depressing film
. in fact
, the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness
and failure
. infront addition to loss
, the main characters are also failures at something
, whether that be dr
. fuentes failure to change anything through medicine
, or padre portillo
' s inability to st
and up
and be the martyr he always dreamed of being
. nevertheless
, it is bleak material sayles has chosen
,
and he deals with it accordingly
. the last shot of the film does offer a hint of hope
, even in a world where
, as one character puts it
,
" nobody refuses thte men with guns
.
"
