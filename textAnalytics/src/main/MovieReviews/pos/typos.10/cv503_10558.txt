there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few peopel have
,
but they chose not to take advantage ofthe this for some personal reason
.
" good will hunting
" is about one of those people
. the will hunting of the
( horrible
) title
( let
' s face it
, this film would be a bitch to title
)
, played by co
- writter matt damon
, is a mathematical genius
. he cin do almost any mathematical connundrum infront about the time it takes tothe brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino
.
and he works at mit
.
.
. as the janitor
. one day
, the professer of one of the most challenging courses
, proffessor lambeau
(
" breaking the waves
"
' s stellan skarsg
? rd
)
, puts a big problem on the board for his students to attempt to complete
. yhe next day
, it
' s already done on the board
,
but noone one in his clas claims to have done it
. so lambeau puts another problem on the board
, this time one that took he
and his colleagues over two years to prove
.
and
, duh
, it
' s done again
. of course
, they catch the guy who did it red h
anded
- will
. before lambeau can find will again
( he ran away when he caught him
)
, will has gotten into a fight with a bunch of punks on a basketball court
, adn struck a police officer
, so lambeau gets him out on probation with two agreements
: a
) he work with him on math
,
and b
) he git soem therapy
. after going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another
( for a hypnotist
, he fakes being under his spell
,
then launches into an impromptu performance of the 70s classic
,
" afternoon delight
"
)
. finally
, lambeau
' s old college roomate
, sean mcguire
( robin williams
)
, a psych professor
, agrees to treat him
,
and the two begin a rocky relationship
, as sean tries to get will to open up
. turns out will had a rough childhood
, being ab
andoned
, annd placed in foster homes adn what not
. it also turns out that will does not wnat to do simple mathematics all his life
; he wants a challenge
.
and that is to hang out with his buds
( including the other co
- writter
, ben affleck
)
,
and do honorable jobs
, like construction
. is it right to amking this genius follow in the footsteps of einstein adn kasinsky
? should this guy be forced to do something he doesn
' t want to do
? this appears to be one of the million questions in this film
, which is jam
- packed with greatness
,
but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should
. i
' m not saying
" ogod will hunting
" is a bad film at all
. it
' s a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments
,
and lots of great things about it
. the acting is amazing
, with two oscar
- nomination
- worthy performances fomr damon
and williams
, who have amazing chemistry together
. we also get soem great support from stellan skarsg
? rd
( great name
)
, ben affleck
,
and from minnie driver
, who plays will
' s love interest
, skylar
. there are tons of individual moments thast i adored
. i loved all the comedy in the film
, especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks
, his various attempts at therapy
,
and of course
, my favorite scene in the entire film
, the one where he delivers a long
, exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them
. i liked the relationship between some of the people
, like will
and skylar
, will
and sean
, sean
and lambeau
,
and iwll
and his friends
. there are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch
.
and htere are even moments in the film which are so honest in their protrayal
, that i felt rightfully uncomfortable
. like the break
- up scene between will
and skylar
, will annd sean
' s frist meeting
, a bar scene between sean anbd lambeau
,
and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn
' t regret meeting his first wife
, who would later suffer a slow
, painful death
,
and leave him lonly
and slightly bitter
.
however
, the main falw of the film is there
' s too much of everything
, adn not enough of it either
. the film tries fo deeper relations between the characters
,
but they
' re sometimes either overwritten or underwritten
. take for example the relationship between sean anbd will
: the film gets an interesting father
/ son as well as doctor
/ patient relationship going with out any problems
,
but when it tries to sohw them as equals
, it falls on its face
. we hear how they went to tje same town
, anbd htere are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times
.
but this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do
. also
, will
' s relatiopnship with his best friend
, chuckie
( affleck
)
, has a nice climax
, bu not enough rising acation
. we see them joking around
,
but when chuckie arrives at a decision bewteen the two of them
, it seems mroe like a superficial reasoning than a more selected noe
. their relationship never goes beyond
" just best friends
,
" anbd his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instade of something more
.
.
. human
. maybe it ws just me
.
and it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean
and lambeau
,
but that
, again
, is underwritten
.
and
, of course
, as in most films like this
, the girl
/ boy relatiopnship isnt pretty underwritten
. we never underst
and what they see in each other
, so when skylar confesses that she loves him
, it seems moreso like it
' s there fo plot details thast anything else
. minnie driver is interesting
,
though
,
and breathes life into her character
. the writing is a bit at fault here
,
but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness
. sure
, it feels overstuffed
,
but it
' s extremely enjoyable
. the dialogue that affleck
and damon have written is amazingly fresh
,
and seems extremely human
. i think that they should get a nomination for thier script chiefly because of the dialogue
, which is amazing
. while this is probably director gus van sant
' s most conservitive film
( you
' d hardly know it
' s the same directer of
" to die fo
,
" the only van sant film i
' ve seen
, really
)
, it
' s still a pretty remarkable film
, albiet a tad overrated
( what
' s this
" best picture
" deal
?
)
.
and if a film puts a smile on my face despite posessing a lot of flaws
, i have no probelm with reccomending it to anyone
.
