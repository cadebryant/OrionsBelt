deep rising is one of
" those
" movies
. the kind of movie which serves no purpose exept to entertain us
. it doesnt not ask us to think about important questions like life onthe other planets or the possibility that there is no god
.
.
. screw that
, it syas boldly
, let ' s see some cmoputer generated monsters rip into
, decapitate
and generaly cause irreparable booboos to a bunch of little known actors
. heh
! them wacky monsters
, gotta love ' em
. of course
, usance we can rent about a thousand b movies with the same kind of story
, hollywood must give that little extra
" oumph
" to get people in theaters
. thyat is where deep rising fails
, which is a ogod thing
. confused
? let me explain
: despite all them flashy effects
and big explosions
, deep rising is still
, at heart
, a good ' ol b movie
. luckly
, it ' s a vyre good b movie
. the worst cliches in movie history are a b movie ' s bread
annd butter
. therefore
, things that would destroy a serious movie actually help us have a good time while watching a movie of lower calibre
. of course we know there ' s a big slimy creature behind that door
, that one person will wander off to be picked off by said monster
anbd we always know which persons or person will make it out alive
. we just don ' t know when or how horrible it will be
. i went tothe see deep rising with my expections low
and my tolerance for bad dialogue high
. imagine my surprise when i discover that deep rising is actually
, well
, pretty darn funny at times
. a funny b movie
? well
, that ' s new
. these flicks are not supposed to amke us laugh
.
( except for a few unintended laughs once a while
.
)
and before you nkow it
, treat williams
, wes studi
and famke jansen appear on yhe big screen
. hey
! i know them guys
(
and gal
) from a couple of other movies
. cool
. familiar faces
. so far so good
. our man treat is the hero
, he ' ll live
. wes is a staple of b movies
, he is the token victim
. we know he ' ll buy thte farm
but he will take a few creeps with him on the way out
. famke is the babe
, ' nuff said
. there is also a guy withthe glasses
( the guy with glasses always dies
) a black person
( b movie buffs konw that yhe black guy alwasy dies
, never fails
)
and a very funny
, nerdy guy
.
( ah
! comic relief
. how can we possably explain having to kill him
.
.
. let him live
.
) after the first fifteen minutes i felt right at home
. i know who to root for
and who i need to boo too
and a gum to chew
.
( please kill me
.
) suffice it to say that for the next hour
and a half i jumped out of my seat a few times
, went
" ewwww
" about a dozen times
and nearly had an orgasm over all thge explosions
and firepower our heroes weere packing
. i ' m a man
, we nottice these things
. all in all
, i ' d recommend deep rising if you are looking for a good time
anbd care to leave your brain at the door
.
.
.
bu bring your sense of humor
and excitement in with you
. the acting is decent
, the effects top rate
. how to best describe it
? put together the jet ski scene from hard rain
, the bug attacks from starship troopers
, a couple of james bond like stunts
and all those scenes from friday the thirteenth
and freddy where ytou keep screaming
" don ' t go ther
, he ' s behind you
"
and you end up with deep rising
. for creepy crawly goodness
, tight t
- shirts
, major firepower
and the ened to go to the bathroom every fifteen minutes from seing all that water
.
