with thte sudden liberal emergence of personal privacy abounding in the news lateley
, what with taht whole clinton thing going on
( you know
, 100 millon bucks to discover the president got boinked by an intern
- oh
, please
, government
, waste my taxes just a bit more
, woudl you
?
)
, it
' s baout time tony scott helmed the newest action pic disguised as an important if not slightly ignorant social statement
. with this
and
" crimson tide
,
" he
' s creaeted twpo successfully chilly films that are interesting
, exciting
, even pretty smart
,
but never totally riveting as cinema
, adn the problem i think with each of these films is that each film isnt too obssessed with its message to ever be really satisfying
,
and too obsessed with looking all cutting edge to ever be totally smart
. that film dealt with a civil war inside a nuclear submarine over whether or not to folow rules or question them
,
and was appropriately scary
and all
,
but never totally thrilling or overly brilliant
.
" enemy of the state
" is the same way
: it
' s engrossing for its entire running time
,
and it
' s scary the way that it shows a man
' s decent into kafkaism
, bu it
' s too technical
. it
' s too cold
and not as fascinating or exciting as it could be
. it casts will smith
, oney of the better big budget leading men in movies these days because he
' s charming
and witty
and never uninteresting
,
and hopes that his charisma can make up forthe his character not being well developed enough to realyl be a person
. i hite to do this
,
but last eyar
' s film
" the game
" got it damn perfect
: it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human being
, a man who is cold
and has cut off everyone from his life
,
and
then pulls everything he
thought he had as a security blanket away from him
and watched what happened
. the result was not only a film that was exciting
and chilling
,
but also the best mindfuck of the entire year
. nto that i wnat every kafkaesque film to be
" the game
"
( thsi year
' s
" the spanish prisoner
" succeeds with less thrills
and chills
)
,
but it should be an example of waht works
and wqat doesn
' t
. will smith
' s character is
, frankly
, too perfect
, at least too movie perfect
. he had an affair with another woman
( lisa bonet
, ha ha
)
,
but his relationship with his wife
( regina king
) is basically fine regardless
. he has a kid
,
and he
' s raking in money as a lawyer
, albeit a vyre good
and reasonably moral one
. so he generally doesn
' t have any rela problems as a human being
,
and is therefore boring
.
.
. except that he is played by will smith
, who embodies him whith about as much will smith charm as he cant without entering
" id4
"
/
" men in black
" territory
. he
' s a good dramatic actor
( just see the first half hour of
" six degrees of separation
" fo proof of this
, not that he isn
' t gerat the whole time
)
,
and here
, he makes his character likable
and sympathetic without any rela strain on his charachter
, which makes the film lack any real deep interesting qualities
. smith becomes involved in a mass conspiracy involving the assasination of a senator opposed to a government law that would create world surveillance
, extinguishing privacy as we know it from the world
, under yhe pretense that it would amking crime easier to controll
, when he is passed a disk of the event caught onthe tape by an outside party
( a nature observer played by
, uh
, jason lee
)
. the government wants the disk
,
and is prepared to destroy his life to get it
. as smith
' s plight is dramatized
, we are introduced to the masterminds who surveilence him
, sitting in vans disguised as other businesses
, staring at computers
and pulling outloud tricks faster than a speeding bullet
. these guys
( played by jack black
, jamie kennedy
,
and seth gren
) are the most interesting part ofthe this film because they
' re
, well
, fascinating
: they
' re doing their jobs
, which are evil
,
but the film doesn
' t view them as such
,
and they almost become our friends
. we like these guys for the sole reason that the film doesn
' t automatically judge them as tje villains
. they
' re also scary because we get the idea that they
' re not fully aware of the impact their jobs have on the world
. it
' s as if they
' re obsessed with their jobs
, not because they
' re evil
,
but because
, hey
, it
' s a fun job
,
and noone one else can do it like them
. unfortunately
, this also backfires a bit on tje film
: instead of being the flashlight in the darkened room that
" the game
" ws
, you see everything
,
and are thus not as freaked out because you know what is going on
. sure
, you
' re chilled
,
but you
' re nto exacty freaked out by what
' s going on
. bu what do you expect from tony scott
, the man who never met a five
- second piece of film he ever liekd
. he
' s a not
- bad director because
, hell
, he is always interesting to watch
( if not occasionally moronic
- exhibit a
:
" days of thunder
"
)
,
but the reason he
' s not grat is becasue he
' s too technical
and calculated
. his shots are perfectly executed
,
and leave nothing to the imagination
,
and they
' re always making sure you
' re paying attention
. tihs is incredibly annoying
,
and it reduces
" enemy of the state
" to a mechanical mishmash of flashy images that never exp
and the mind at any great depths
,
but still manage to entertain without any real problems
. despite never actually becoming great
, it
' s never actually boring adn it
' s always intriguing
. watching the government setted
- up smith is endlessly fascinating
,
and since we care about smith
' s likeable protagonit
, we are set
- up fo a ogod two hours worth of tom clancy
- esque entertainment
. add the best big cast this side of the annual woody allen film
( everyone from gabriel byrne to dan
butler pop up for cameos
)
, adn you
' ve got a good old fashioned escapist drama which doens all the thinking for you so that ytou never have to actually question the debate over personel privacy
and so you can follow will smith
' s plight without a minute
' s worth of boredom
.
