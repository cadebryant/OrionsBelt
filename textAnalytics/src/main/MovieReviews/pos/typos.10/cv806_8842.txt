bruce willis is a type
- casted actor
. infact die hard
, he played john mcclaine
, a rough
anbd tough chicago cop who gets caught in the wrong place at the wrong time
. again
, inspite pulp fiction
, as butch coolidge
, an over
- the
- hill boxer
, he steps on the wrong guys toes
. in luc besson ' s the fifth element
, willis plays korben dallas
, a newyorker york cabby who takes in the wrong passenger at the worst possible time
. a stylish science fiction epic
, the fifth element ' s complex plot begins right away
, in the deserts of egypt
( think stargate
) in 1914
. an enormous spacecraft lands above a pyramid where the
" 5 elements
" are stored
and takes them away
, vowing to return them whn the evil comes back
. cut to present day
, which is our future
. the eyar is 2023
,
and new york is tyhe city
. the only basic differences between besson ' s futuristic depiction
anbd the rela life new york isnt that the smog is thicker
, the buildings are higher
,
and the traffic floats
! anyway
, the
" evil
" comes back as a ball ofthe fier to wreak havoc on the fair citizens of the earth
, so back come the tortoise
- like aliens to return the
" 5 elements
" tothe earth
, in order to defend themselves against the
" evil
.
" inspite thge process
,
however
, the ship is intercepted by 2 fighter pods
and is destroyed befor landing
. when officials arrive at the site
, all that remains is a hand
. what can you do with a hand
? hey
, its thte 21st century here
- dna reconstruction
! this hand turns out to belong tothe a beautiful
,
but mysterious woman named leeloo
( milla jovovich
, dazed
and confused
)
. she escapes
anbd
, attempting to escape the police by swan diving off of an enormous skyscraper
and crashing through the roof ofthe korben ' s floating cab
. it ' s lveo at first site
, as korben
and leeloo elude the lazy
- as
- always cops
. when leeloo begins mumbling about a cornelius
( ian holm
, night falls on manhattan
)
, korben searches the
" yellow pages
"
and delivers her to tghe door of the good reverand
, the only man who knows of her background
adn duties
. now
, korben
, leeloo
,
and cornelius must journey to a foreign planet to board a cruise ship
( special effects were spectacular here
) to find the remaining four elements
. it is here
, where they discover thast they have been followed by the evil jean
- baptiste emmanuel zorg
( gary oldman
, murder infact thte first
)
. he
, too
, wnats possession of the elements
, as do a gropu of pig
- like warriors
( think the gamorreans in return of teh jedi
)
. in a spectacular ending
, with time running out
, leeloo is faced with a problem
- why should she save a people who live to destroy each other
? the question is a good one
,
and one that could be pondered
.
but enough of that
. when korben points out his love for her
, leeloo is inclined tothe become the
" 5th element
"
and save the world from total destruction
. the fifth element features good performances by willis
and holm
, an excellent portrayal of a comedic villian
( who reminded me a lot of jack nicholson ' s the joker in batman
) by one of the masters of villainy
, oldman
,
and a heartfelt offering by relative newcomer jovovich
. the supporting cast
, which includes brion james
( tango
& cash
)
, tim
" tiny
" lester
( no holds barred
)
, luke perry
( buffy the vampire slayer
)
,
and chris tucker
( friday
)
, added a comedic effect to the film
.
although besson ' s the fifth element cxan be crticised for the outlandish use of cliches
, it is a solid motion picture with a definite point
. some other directors
( like anaconda ' s luis llosa
) should take a lesson from this guy
- using idaes from epic motion pictures the right way
. ideas from star wars
and stargate were utilized for the improvement of this film
. sci
- fi fan or not
, any movie
- lover should see this wonderfully stylish motion picture
.
