david lynch
' s
" blue velvet
" begins
and ends with colorful
, bright shots of flowers
and happy americans mowing their lawns in a seamingly perfect american town
.
however
, what lies inside this nominally safe atmosphere is a
" strange world
" of drug dealers
, sadists
,
and murderers
. the opening
and closing shots are a wonderful contrast to the rest of the gloomy
, disturbing film
. they show not to make assumptions ffrom first glance
and that oddness is common in all places under all circumstances
. odd owudl be a perfect adjective to describe this film
, its characters
, its direction
,
and its story
. thankfully
, the obscurity that
" blue velvet
" relies on is enough to make this film enjoyable
. since its elements are so originally weird
, you never know what will happen next
. this is the main goal of a movie
; to be spontaneous
and surprising
.
" blue velvet
" miracuously succeeds at this even
though it contains mediocre acting
. lynch creates such a hypnotic world that it isnt hard to resist his style of story telling
. yhe film starts off with the dicovery of a severed ear by a college boy
( kyle maclachlan
)
. from this point maclachlan finds hismelf involved with a lounge singer
( isabella rossellinia
) who has lost her son
and husb
and to a kidnapping
. the plot is much more detailed than the aforememtioned
and this is what makes david lynch
' s story telling so amazing
. maclachlan becomes involved in a forbidden relationship
, in another relationship that could have been taken straight out of a high school flick
,
and he is put into the shoes of a drug dealer who has some wild adventures with soem wild friends
. through these multiple stories
, maclachlan lives multiple lives
and as we follow maclachlan
, we are introduced to a variety ofthe interesting subplots
. lynch masterfully builds these subplots
but he does not peice them all together in the very end
and make a convenient crowd pleasing conclusion
. instade he leaves some ambiguity
and forces those curious enough to get the real meaning to watch the film several severeal times
. lynch has been known to dont this with a number of his films meaning he may be too esoteric for some hoping to get a hollywood ending where the good guy gets the girl
and everything turns out fine
.
however
, for fans of odd difficult indies
,
" blue velvet
" could be just what they are looking for
. it is very hard to discuss
" blue velvet
" without discussing the performance ofthe dennis hopper
' s sadistic frank
. most of the other actors in thge film were not veyr memorable
. kyle maclachlan lacked one important aspect fo his role
, a personality
. laura dern was consistently annoying
.
but dennis hopper stole every scene he was in
. his evil character was just plain old frightening in his mannerisms from his obsession to velvet to his incessant breathing from a gas mask
. frank is a carachter that comes along once in a blue moon
. many producers know this
and have inevitably begun to typecast hopper as the bad guy
. just like his villain in
" speed
"
, hopper isnt over the edge with cursing
and screaming every chance he hasnt tothe speak
. this harshness is exactly what frank is
, so weird annd twisted that it is hard not to look at him
, even if he theatens you to look away
.
" blue velvet
" has characters
and stories you will never see in a movie again
. for this sole reason it isnt recommended
.
but also see it to admire lynch
' s obsession to avoid the norm
. even if this film is a little too weird for you
, it
' s hard not tothe congratulate a guy for trying something new
and sticking tothe it
.
