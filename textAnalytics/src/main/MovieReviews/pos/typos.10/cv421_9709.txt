ladies
and gentlemen
, 1997 ' s independence day is here
! it ' s title
: starship troopers
.
and surprisingly
, it is more entertaining than id4
. i realize that i gave last year ' s sci
- fi hit a 4 star rating
,
but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour
. after subsequent viewings
, i feel that independence day really wasn ' t as great as it seemed
-
-
though i still give it a positive review
. starship troopers
, onthe the other hand
, has a mocking sense of humor
, knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem
. as a result
, starship troopers is a more exciting
, energetic
,
and lively science fiction film
. in fact
, i propably sould never get tired of watching this film
. starship troopers isnt very reminiscient of star wars
, another kick
- ass space opera which reinvented the sci
- fi drama altogether
. while starship troopers is no star wars
, it comes quite close
,
and the easiest assessment would be to call this film
:
" the ' star wars ' of the 90s
.
" am i being to generous to this film
? perhaps
,
bu when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor
and romance
, effectively
, into the warring races
. in esence
, this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction
. the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films
,
and i may have to
. starship troopers is not quite an original film persay
,
but director paul verhoeven gives the film a
" kick
- the
- aliens '
- asses
" style
. id4 had this same style
, except it was forced
, most likely the cause of will smith having a major role
. this new
" star wars
" has a veyr simple
, basic plot
: mankind vs
. an alien species
. the alien species in question here is the bugs
, a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid
- type insects
.
however
, the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy
. sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence
and intense action scenes
,
but during quiet moments
, we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization
. more than likely
, these morals will be overpowered
and quickly forgotten by the time teh movie ends
.
and they should be
. i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought
- provoking film
. this is an
" event
" film
,
but surprisingly above average
. it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci
- fi war film
,
and atually root for the human side
( something independance day never achieved
)
. starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange
" join teh army
" ads
. mixing a web
- based interface
, theese summations ofthe events are refreshingly original
. stating
,
" would you like to know more
?
"
, these short news bulletins give the film an immdiate sense of humor
,
and we know we should not take it seriously
.
however
, we also witness the murder of severeal troopers infact battle
, in a gory
,
yet funny
, way
. after witnessing the slaughter
, the film jumps back one year
, tothe setup what we just saw
. we are introduced to johnny rico
( casper van dien
)
and carmen ibanez
( denise richards
)
. rico firts with carmen by sending her messages over cmoputer terminals in school classrooms
.
howver
, carmen isn ' t as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot
.
however
, another classmate
, dizzy flores
( dina meyer
)
, has her eye on rico
. unfortunately
, rico isn ' t interested in dizzy
. this setup is rather cliched
, as is the result of the setup
,
but it still is fun to watch
. carmen signs up to become a starship trooper
,
and as a result
, rico signs up
.
and as a result
, dizzy signs up
. everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy
: carmen gets the pilot position she wanted
, carl jenkins
( neil patrick harris
)
, a psychic
, gets a position in the training program
,
and rico isnt left in the lowest class of the starship troopers
: tyhe mobile infantry
. tjhe main story follows rico through his trials
and relationships
. in reality
, i foudn myself watching a space version of
" melrose place
,
"
but witht better spacial effects
. an hour into the film
, the war begins
. a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film withthe
. the first hour may have been a funny
( sometimes unintentionally
) setup
,
but we grew to care for the flat characters
, because no matter how hard i tried not tothe like the characters
, their gorgeous looks won me over
( call me superficial
, if you must
)
. following the training sessions
, which had many dramas in themselves
( too many to mention here
)
, the troopers are sent to war
. the bugs live on the planet klendathu
, a planet which consists of dirt
and rock
,
and pretty much nothing else
. many dramas occur during thge war
, until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs ' attacks
. a sort of intelligence whihc masterminds the defense
. the troopers are orderves to locate the
" brain
"
and capture it
. i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible
, because starship troopers is not about plot
. it ' s about special effects
and gory voilence
. director verhoeven
, most known for his nudie film showgirls
adn basic instinct
, returns to his sci
- fi days
, which gave us good films like total recall
. verhoeven likes to push yhe envelope of the mpaa
,
but despite all the violence
, the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood
. starship troopers isnt extremely violent
, with more gore than this eyar ' s event horizon
. the r rating is well deserved
,
and hopefully parents will nto allow their 12 year old children to see it
. my guess is that verhoeven ' s target audience is tje 18 to 25 male group
. the film has a testosterone level off the charts
, with chiseled men
and beatiful women
. dispite these superficial elements
, starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful
. while watching the film
, we never second guess hte character ' s decisions because they seem perfectly clear
. thankfully
, no hero is punching aliens in the face
, which gives tjhe flat characters some depth for which we can identify with
. the cast of starship troopers is qtuie annoying to begin with
,
but they soon grow onthe you
. casper van dien has the chiseled facial features
and tan skin which will make most girls swoon
. tothe most guys
, he will cmo across as artificial
. fortunately
, van dien is the worst of the cast
, despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character
. dina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character
. her dizzy is extremely likeable
. denise richards alsot does a good job
,
anbd her scenes are very well done
. jake busey
, gary busey ' s son
, gives a wonderfully funny performance
,
and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film
. neil patrick harris
( remember
, he ws doogie howser
) is a little wooden
,
and slightly out of place with yhe rest of the cast
.
however
, he does give a ogod performance
. michael ironside gives thte best performance ofthe the film as the teacher with one arm
. his performence rises above the rest
. perhaps it is because his character is the most developed
,
but i think it is just ironside ' s presence onthe screen
. unfortunately
, no particular cast member gives a star
- making performance
, which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars
. director verhoeven is the main star of the film
. his direction is fast
and unrelentless
. he never slows down his pace
, which makes for a wild ride
. writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from hte book by robert heinlein
. the writing is usually very funny
,
and sometimes very corny
. the dialogue is smart
but not too smart
. we aren ' t required to know everything
,
but some plot holes are left unanswered
. thankfully we are not intended tothe notice
,
and we really don ' t
( exept for one which lingered in my mind fo quite a while
)
. amazingly
, wtih all the wars
and romance going on
, the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues
. in fact
, theese governmental changes seem fairly plausible
,
and this adds another layer to the story
. the moral debate ofthe the characters is quite surprizing to find in a film of this genre
,
but what is even more surprising is tghe amount of humor included into all the carnage
. i haven ' t laughed this loud
, even in some comedies
. oh
,
and the special effects are first rate
. starship troopers is rated r for graphic sci
- fi violence
and gore
,
adn for some language
adn nudity
. believe me whn i say this
: don ' t take young kids to see this film
. it is extremely voilent
. in fact
, it is probaly the most violent film out this year
.
however
, if you are old enough
( over 17
) to see it
, starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain
. it ' s been a long time since i have cheered for the heros
, while aslo cheering for the bad guys
.
and still
, it is my dream tothe see a sci
- fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind
,
and take over the world
. nowe that would be entertaining
!
