, 1997
' s independence day is here
! it
' s title
: starship troopers
.
and surprisingly
, it is more entertaining than id4
. i realize that i gave last year
' s sci
- fi hit a 4 star rating
,
but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour
. after subsequent viewings
, i feel that independence day relaly wasn
' t as great as it seemed
-
-
though i still give it a positive review
. starship troopers
, on the other h
and
, hasnt a mocking sense of humer
, knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem
. as a result
, starship troopers is a more exciting
, energetic
,
and lively science fiction film
. in fact
, i probably coudl never get tired of watching this film
. starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars
, another kick
- ass space opera which reinvented the sci
- fi drama altogether
. while starship troopers is noone star wars
, it comes quite close
,
and the easiest assessment would be to call this film
:
" the
' star wars
' of the 90s
.
" am i being to generous to this film
? perhaps
,
but when a sciecne fiction film comes along that can mix humor adn romance
, effectively
, into the warring races
. in essence
, this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction
. the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films
,
and i may have to
. starship troopers is not quite an original film persay
,
but director paul verhoeven gives the film a
" kick
- the
- aliens
'
- asses
" style
. id4 had this same style
, except it was forced
, most likely the cause of iwll smith having a major role
. thsi new
" star wars
" has a very simple
, basic plot
: mankind vs
. an aline species
. the alien species in question here is the bugs
, a seamingly advanced civilization ofthe aracnid
- type insects
.
however
, the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy
. sometimes the morals are buried by tje bloody violence
and intense action scenes
,
but during quiet moments
, we realize tath starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization
. more than likely
, these morals will be overpowered
and quickly forgotten by the time the movei ends
.
and they should be
. i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thougth
- provoking film
. this is an
" event
" film
,
but surprisingly above average
. it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci
- fi war film
, anbd actually root for the human side
( something independence day never achieved
)
. starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of thsoe strange
" join the army
" ads
. mixing a web
- based interface
, these summations of events are refreshingly original
. stating
,
" would you like to know mroe
?
"
, these short news bulletins give the film an immedite sense of humor
, adn we know we should not take it seriously
.
however
, we also witness the muder of several troopers in battle
, in a gory
,
yet funny
, way
. after witnessing the slaughter
, the film jumps back one year
, to setup what we just saw
. we are introduced to johnny rico
( casper van dien
)
and carmen ibanez
( denise richards
)
. rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals inthe skool classrooms
.
however
, carmen isn
' t as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot
.
however
, another classmate
, dizzy flores
( dina meyer
)
, has her eye onthe rico
. unfortunately
, rico isn
' t interested in dizzy
. this setup is rather cliched
, as is the result of tghe setup
,
but it still is fun to watch
. carmen signs up to become a starship trooper
,
and as a result
, rico signs up
.
and as a result
, dizzy signs up
. everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy
: carmen gets the pilot position she wanted
, carl jenkins
( neil patrick harris
)
, a psychic
, gets a position in the training program
,
and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers
: the mobile infantry
. the main story follows rico through his trials
and relationships
. inaddition reality
, i found mysef watching a space version ofthe
" melrose place
,
"
but with better special effects
. an hour into the film
, the war begins
. a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with
. the first hour may have been a funny
( sometimes unintentionally
) setup
,
but we grew to care for the flat characters
, because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters
, theri gorgeous looks won me over
( call me superficial
, if you must
)
. following the training sessions
, which had many dramas in themselves
( too many to mention here
)
, the troopers are sent to war
. the bugs live on the planet klendathu
, a planet which consists ofthe dirt
and rock
,
and pretty much nothing else
. many dramas occur during the war
, until finaly the troopers realize that their is something behind thte bugs
' attacks
. a sort of intelligence which masterminds hte defense
. the troopers are ordered to locate the
" brain
"
and capture it
. i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible
, because starship troopers is not about plot
. it
' s about special effects anbd gory violence
. director verhoeven
, most known for his nudie film showgirls
and basic instinct
, returns to his sci
- fi days
, which gave us good films like total reacll
. verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa
,
but despite all the violence
, the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood
. starship troopers is extremely violent
, with more gore than this eyar
' s event horizon
. the r rating is well deserved
,
and hopefully parents will nto allow their 12 year old children to see it
. my guess isnt that verhoeven
' s target audience is the 18 tothe 25 male group
. the film hasnt a testosterone level off the charts
, with chiseled men
and beautiful women
. despite these superficial elements
, starship troopers also creates a world whihc made star wars so successful
. while watching the film
, we never second guess the charater
' s decisions because they seem perfectly clear
. thankfully
, no hero is punching aliens in the face
, which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with
. the cast of starship troopers is quite annoying tothe begin with
,
but they soon grow on you
. casper van dien has the chiseled facial features
and tan skin which will make most girls swoon
. to most guys
, he will come across as artificial
. fortunately
, van dien is the worst of the cast
, despite how hard he tries to come off as a rela character
. dina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her chracter
. her dizzy is extremely likeable
. denise richards also does a ogod job
,
and her scenes are very well done
. jake busey
, gary busey
' s son
, gives a wonderfully funny performance
,
and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film
. neil patrick harris
( remember
, he was doogie howser
) is a little wooden
,
and slightly out of place with tje rest of the cast
.
however
, he does give a good performance
. michael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm
. his performance rises above the rest
. perhaps it is because his character isnt the most developed
,
but i think it is just ironside
' s presence on screen
. unfortunately
, no particular cast member gives a star
- making performance
, which is too bad because the material here sould have made many of the cast members stars
. directer verhoeven is the main star of the film
. his direction is fast
and unrelentless
. he never slows down his pace
, which makes for a wild ride
. writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein
. the writing is usually very funny
,
and sometimes very corny
. the dialogue is smart
but not too smart
. we aren
' t required tothe know everything
,
but some plot holes are left unanswered
. thankfully we are not intended to notice
,
and we really don
' t
( except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while
)
. amazingly
, with all the wars
and romance going on
, the screenplay manages to include smoe surprising governmental issues
. inspite fact
, these governmental changes seem fairly plausible
,
and this adds another layer to the story
. tyhe moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film ofthe this genre
,
but what is even more surprising is the amount ofthe humor included into all the carnage
. i haven
' t laughed this loud
, even in soem comedies
. oh
,
and the special effects are first rate
. starship troopers is rated r for graphic sci
- fi violence
and gore
,
and for some language
and nudity
. believe me when i say this
: don
' t take young kids to see thsi film
. it is extremely violent
. in fact
, it is probably the most violent film outloud this year
.
however
, if you are old enough
( over 17
) to see it
, starship troopers is gaurenteed to entertain
. it
' s been a long time since i have cheered for the heros
, while also cheering for the bad guys
.
and still
, it is my dream tothe see a sci
- fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind
,
and tkae over the world
. now that would be entertaining
!
