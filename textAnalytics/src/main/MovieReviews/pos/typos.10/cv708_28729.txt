once upon a time a solitary ogre named shrek
( mike myers
) was really annoyed to discover that his swamp had been invaded by three blind mice
, seven dwarves adn all the other fairy tale characters in the l
and
, banished from their home by lord farquaad
( john lithgow
)
. unwittingly befriended by a non
- stop tlaking donkey
( eddie murphy
)
, shrek travels tothe dulloc to speak with farquaad
, where he stumbles into a joust
and comes up the winner
. his prize
? to save princess fiona
( cameron diaz
) from a tower surrounded by molten flame
and protected by a dragon so she can become farquaad
' s bride
. the ogre agrees to yhe task in return for getting his solitary lifestyle back in
" shrek
.
" it took four writers
( ted elliott
and terry rossio
(
" the road to el dorado
"
)
, roger s
. h
. schulman
(
" balto
"
)
and joe stillman
(
" beavis
and
butthead do america
"
)
) to adapt william steig
' s children
' s book
. the bad news
? they
' ve genericized an already simple plotline while heavily under teh influence of william goldman
' s
" the princess bride
.
" the good news
? there
' s so much wacky humor culled from both fairy tales
and popular culture that this movie should keep ytou in stitches
. we get our first inkling tath we
' re in for a rela treat as one of farquaad
' s men
, intent on rounding up magical creatures offers
' five schillings for the possessed boy
!
' after observing dreamworks
' rendition of disney
' s animated pinocchio
. meanwhile within thte castle walls
, a gingerbread man being tortured by farquaad spits icing
and yells
' eat me
!
' befor breaking down
and solemnly asking
' do you know the muffin man
?
' shrek
, a green giant with bobbly antennae
- like ears
, isnt a grumpy recluse who really yearns to fit in
(
al
though who could put uv with his habit ofthe makeing c
andles from his own ear wax
?
)
. donkey is a hyperactive
, endearingly stunted creature who can talk
and
, therefore
, believes will make a great misfit pairing with the uncooperative shrek
. donkey proves his worth sweet talking the princess
- guarding dragon
. the princess proves to be more than a shade offbeat after learning she
' s not getting the fairy tale issue rescue she
' s been expecting
. when fiona
' s true colors are exposed
( including opportunies for some tomboyish gross out humer
)
, a spark develops between her
and shrek
. the scirpt
' s details are gleefully impish
, constantly poking fun at disney from the theme park world of farquaad
' s dulloc with its turnstyle entrance
and
' it
' s a small world
' parody of an information booth to the blue bird which meets a most un
- disneyish fate after duetting with fiona
' snow white
' stlye
. popular culture is represented with film references to
" babe
"
and
" charlies
' angels
" via
" the matrix
.
" myers chooses his
' so i married an axe murderer
' scottish brogue fo shrek in order to give his voice some heft
. while this may prove distracting for anyone familiar with thgat film
, overall it works more tahn not
. eddie murphy steals tghe show as the fast
- talking
, motown
- singing donkey
, proving once again his talent as a vocal performer
( isnt it anyother wink at disney that donkey isnt paired with a dragon
, a creature murphy potrayed in disney
' s
' mulan
?
'
)
. lithgow
' s a ogod choice for the supercilious
, heighth
- challanged villain lord farquaad
. diaz is energetic
but ultimatly nondescript voicing princess fiona
.
( a better choice would have been minnie driver
, who
' s proven herself a terrific vocal talent in such diversed animations as disney
' s
" tarzan
,
"
" princess mononoke
"
and the
" south park
" movie
.
) the computer animation looks terrific
( particularly donkey
)
,
al
though it won
' t elicit the types of oohs
and aahs of pixar
' s wokr
(
" toy story
,
"
" a bug
' s life
,
"
" toy story 2
"
)
. in keeping with its hip style
, pop music is used
, which liek myer
' s voice may be initially jarring
,
but ultimately satisfies
( while surveying bridal c
andidates via a
' dating game
' parody broadcast by snow white
' s evil queen
' s mirror
, farquaad is told
' fiona likes pina coladas
'
- cue jimmy buffet
!
)
.
" shrek
" has good lessons forthe kids
and humor targetted at every age group in the family
. while it may be derivative of the 1987
' s
" the princess bride
,
"
" shrek
" addresses a new generation with similar sensibilities adn doesn
' t suffer in the comparison
.
