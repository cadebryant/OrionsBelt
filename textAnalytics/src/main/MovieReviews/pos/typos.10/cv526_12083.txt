' s spanish inquisition synopsis
: american actress gwyneth paltrow with dark hair
, playing a londoner
? believe it
. sliding doors is a love
' what if
' story
. the gimmick is that it
' s really two stories
: the film follows the life of helen
( gwyneth paltrow
) down two directions
. in the beginning
, likeable gal
' helen
'
( gwyneth paltrow
) gets unexpectedly fired from her advertising job
. so she goes into the subway train station meaning to return home early to her apartment
and her sleeping live
- inwhich lover gerry
( john lynch
)
. helen doesn
' t know it
, bu she is at a fateful junction in life
: 1
) if she enters through the sliding door of a london subway train her life takes one path with one future 2
) if she stays on the platform her life takes another path with a different future
. the film shows what happens in both paths
, switching back
and forth between intertwined
, parallel stories
. in story one
, helen meets a charming
and talkative monty python fan named james
( john hannah
) on the train
. arriving home early
, she discovers that her live
- in
, gerry
( john lynch
)
, is having sex with his former lover lydia
( jeanne tripplehorn
)
. this leads to a life where helen moves out
. helen
' s winsome new friend james helps her recover from a broken heart
,
and encourages her to start her own business
. in story two
, helen experiences a different fate
. she misses the train
, never meets james
,
and doesn
' t get home early enough to discover gerry
' s infidelity
. in this new life
, helen takes up odd menial jobs
,
and faces the constant sneaking suspicion that all is nto right with her relationship with gerry
. will tghe truth of the heart finally work its way through a number of problems
and setbacks in both scenarios
? opinion
: rejoice all ye monty python fans
, gwyneth paltrow fans
,
and watchers of quirky romance flicks
. at last here
' s proof that there
' s still creativity inthe 1990s filmmaking
. sliding doors is refreshingly different from anything this year
. not only is it a well
- acted
, heartwarming film
,
but it
' s also easily gwyneth paltrow
' s best recent performance
. when helen
( paltrow
) screams that her unfaithful boyfriend is a
' shagging wanker
,
'
( a british phrase better left untranslated
) she sounds like she knows what she
' s talking about
! nor does sliding doors go overboard with formulaic true love or other stereotypes
. nobody scrambles around in danger
, screaming
,
" i will find you no matter what
, my darling
!
" when helen finds herself on a boat in tjhe starlight whith james
, she doesn
' t take the easy way out
and leap into his arms
, since she
' s suppoed to be recovering from heartache
.
and hansome live
- in boyfriend gerry isn
' t the stereotypical screen hunk
( either a stud or a snob
)
. instead he
' s a nervous
and indecisive
, almost helpless hunk
. another example
: when one of the protagonists lies wounded in a hospital
, sliding doors gives us niether the
' hospital miricle
' nor a maudlin tragedy
but surprises us with a third variation
. in other words
, all of the characters seem non
- stereotyped
, human
,
and local
. there are minor inconveniences
. since sliding doors switchs bcak
and forth between twpo possibile fates
, it
' s occasionally difficult tothe distinguish between the two
. distinguishing between the two stories isn
' t a problem in the scenes containing paltrow
, who sports two different hairstyles
.
but in scenes containing only lydia
and gerry
, who look the smae in both stories
, it
' s slightly confusing
. allso
, quite a fewd snappy comebacks referring to american pop culture
( seinfeld
, woody allen
, etc
.
) are spoken by the british characters
.
but these seem slightly forced
, given that the remaining dialogue is predominantly british slang
. possibly an attempt by the screenwriter to balance the british so that american audiences can feel more comfortable
? sliding doors is a charming
, quirky
, original
, happy romance with a little
' philisophy of fate
' thrown in
. monty python
and yhe meaning of fate
, anybody
?
