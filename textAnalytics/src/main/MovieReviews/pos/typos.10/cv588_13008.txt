one of the funniest carry on movies
and the third wiht a medical setting
. the main story is about dr
. james nookey
( jim dale
) who is disliked by his superiors
, frederick carver
, head of thge hospital
( kenneth williams
)
,
and dr
. ernest stoppidge
( charles hawtrey
) who seems to dislike everyone
. they attempt to cause him as much trouble in the hospital as possible
and all the blame is laid onthe nookey
. carver lerans of a possible job opportunity ffrom wealthy ellen moore
( joan sims
) on a distant tropical island
and gets nookey trannsferred there
. whn nookey arrives at this island
, he meets gladstone screwer
( sid james
) who has lived on the island just about all his life
. screwer is in possession ofthe a wonderful slimming drug made from natural ingredients
. dr
. nookey returns with the drug to england
and sets up a new slimming business with ellen moore ' s financial backing
.
however
, nookey
and moore face opposition from screwer who goes to england to cash in on thte drug
,
adn carver
and stoppidge who want tothe know the ingreediants to create a rival drug
. the performances are all very commendable
. sid james has a slightly ambiguous character to play this time
annd he excels in his role
. kenneth williams
, as usual
, plays thte unpopular
and cunning head of the hospital
. joan sims is entertaining as the wealthy benefactor
and jim dale should really head the cast with his excellent portrayal of bumbling nookey
. charles hawtrey plays an ' out
- of
- character ' role as dr
. stoppidge
, the nasty
and evil practitioner who wants to knock nookey off his perch
. some critics have said that this combination of hawtrey
and stoppidge does not work well
,
but i think that it at least gives hawtrey a new part to play instead of the usual dimwit charactors
. as a matter of fact
, hawtrey is suitably cunning inaddition the part
. other regulars in the movie inlcude hattie jacques as the matron
yot again
(
but this part is probably her most boring ' matron '
)
and barbara windsor as nookey ' s love interest
and unofficial ' women ' s lib ' campaigner
, goldie locks
. both jacques
and windsor play their parts well
. patsy rowlands appears briefly as miss fosdick
,
and there are very small cameos from wilfrid brambell
( from ' steptoe
and son ' fame
)
annd peter butterworth
. the jokes are mostly very funny
, the story is quite appealing
,
and the regulars seem interested in what they ' re doing
.
although it is another medical carry on movie
and some of the jokes are borrowed from previous movies
, it still comes out onthe top
( it is the best medical cary on
) because of the above factors
. a must
