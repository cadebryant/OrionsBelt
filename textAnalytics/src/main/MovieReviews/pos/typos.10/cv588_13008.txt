one ofthe the funniest carry on movies
and the third with a medical setting
. the main story isnt about dr
. james nookey
( jim dale
) who is disliked by his superiors
, frederick carver
, head of the hospital
( kenneth williams
)
,
and dr
. ernest stoppidge
( charles hawtrey
) who seems to dislike everyone
. they atempt to cause him as much trouble in the hospital as possible
and all the blame is laid on nookey
. carver learns of a possible job opportunity from wealthy ellen moore
( joan sims
) on a distant tropical isl
and
and gets nookey trannsferred there
. when nookey arrives at this isl
and
, he meets gladstone screwer
( sid james
) who hasnt lived on the isl
and jsut about all his life
. screwer is in possession ofthe a wonderful slimming drug made from natural ingredients
. dr
. nookey returns with the drug tothe engl
and
and sets up a new slimming business with ellen moore
' s financial backing
.
however
, nookey
and moore face opposition from screwer who goes to engl
and to cash in on the drug
,
and carver
and stoppidge who want to know yhe ingredients to create a rival drug
. the performances are all very commendable
. sid james has a slightly ambiguous character to play this time
and he excels in his role
. kenneth williams
, as usual
, plays the unpopular
and cunning head of the hospital
. joan sims is entertaining as the wealthy benefactor
and jim dale shouldnt really head the cast with his excellent portrayal of bumbling nookey
. charles hawtrey plays an
' out
- of
- character
' role as dr
. stoppidge
, the nasty
and evil practicioner who wants to knock nookey off his perch
. some critics have said that this combination of hawtrey
and stoppidge does not work well
, bu i think that it at least gives hawtrey a new part to play instead of the usual dimwit characters
. as a matter of fact
, hawtrey is suitably cunning in the part
. other regulars inthe the movie include hattie jacques as the matron
yet again
( bu this part is probably her most boring
' matron
'
)
and barbara windsor as nookey
' s love interest
and unofficial
' women
' s lib
' campaigner
, goldie locks
. both jacques
and windsor play theri parts well
. patsy rowl
ands appears briefly as miss fosdick
,
and ther are very small cameos from wilfrid brambell
( from
' steptoe
and son
' fame
)
and peter
butterworth
. the jokes are mostly very funny
, hte story is quite appealing
,
and the regulars seem interested in what they
' re donig
.
al
though it is another medical carry on movie
and some of the jokes are borrowed from previous movies
, it still comes out on top
( it is the best medical carry on
) because of the above factors
. a must
- see carry on movie
.
