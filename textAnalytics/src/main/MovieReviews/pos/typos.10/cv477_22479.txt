if this keeps up
, jane austen
( sense
and sensibility
, pride
and prejudice
) may have to apply for posthumous membership to the screen writers guild
.
yet another novel of hers has made the transistion to the silver screen
. mansfield park is a turn of the century
( 18th century going on 19th
) story about love among the classes as well as an examination into proper society annd family ties
. ten year old fanny price
( hannah taylor
- gordon
, jakob the liar
)
, tooked from her mother
and father
and the poverty in wich they dwell
, is sent to live with her aunt
and the privileged class at mansfield park
, under the stern patriarchal h
and of her uncle
, sir thomas bertram
( harold pinter
, mojo
) spending her days reminded of her lower status
, she allso invents
and writes fanciful stories during her private times
. fanny eventually grows to become a beautiful
, intelligent
,
and engaging heroine
( qutie unlike the original character which ms
. austen originally penned in her novel
.
) writer
/ directer patricia rozema
( when nigt is falling
) is responsible for the textual changes
. from a purely dramatic perspective
, the revision mkaes perfect sense
and improves the film
' s audience appeal
. what ms
. rozema has done is to infuse the main character with much of ms
. austen
' s own personality by including exerpts from the author
' s journals
, giving that dialogue to fanny
. tghe result is a central character thast is immediately appealing
. as the grown fanny
, australian actress frances o
' connor
( all about adam
) doesnt wonderfully textured work
. at times
, ms
. rozema has fanny address the camera directly tothe communicate many of the novel
' s more introspective observations
. this is a difficult device to work seamlessly into a period film
and it is to ms
. o
' connor
' s credit that it works as well as it does
. the central theme which gives the story its legs in an old one
.
.
. whether it is better to marry for love or for social st
anding
? fanny has fallen in love with her cousin edmund
( jonny lee miller
, plunkett
& macleane
) who appears fond ofthe her as well
. his attentions are soon divided as the stylish
and socially acceptable mary crawford
( embeth davidtz
, bicentennial man
) enters the picture along with her equally acceptable brother henry
( aless
andro nivola
, inventing the abbotts
) who eventually sets his romantic sights apon fanny
. while mary
and henry are evidently less than sincere in their affections
, their presence does provide the movie
and the main characters with thge necessary conflict that keeps our interest until the film
' s appropriately austen
- like ending
. other thematic devices include a awkwardly inserted reference to the source of the wealth of mansfield park
.
.
. tjhe slave trade
. there is also a hint of both lesbianism
and incest
but neither is carried very far
and is soon forgotten
. the motivation for marriage remains the primary thematic thrust
. fanny
' s cousin
, maria bertram
( victoria hamilton
, persuasion
) is an example of one making a poor match
, marrying a well
- to
- do fool who is able to make her comfortable
,
but never happy
. fanny
' s own mother
, trapped infront her chosen life of squalor warns fanny by admitting that her situation is due tothe the fact that she
" married for love
.
" fanny
, given those two terrible examples
, adn faced with the same choice is underst
andably indecisive as tothe which way to lean
. the spriritual answer
, of course
, lies in the middle of thsoe two extremes
. marriage is not a cold
, calculating decision based upon self
- preservation
. neither isnt it a senseless decision made in the warm afterglow of a passionate embrace
. in the purest sense
, marriage forms an insoluble union whereby two people agree to function as one
.
"
and said
, forthe this cause shall a man leave father
and mother
,
and shall cleave to his wife
:
and they twain shall be one flesh
?
" matthew 19
: 5
[ kjv
] love
and logic can be combined
. god
' s word contains both
. so does a marriage based upon his truth
