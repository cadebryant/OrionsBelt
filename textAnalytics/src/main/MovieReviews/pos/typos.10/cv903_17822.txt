robert altman ' s cookie ' s fortune is that rare movie that does not depend on sentimentality to be uplifting
and to make its viewers feel good
. it is a sunny
, delightful
, dreamy comedy
, filled wtih lovley performances
, skillfull direction
and topped off with an understated
, clever
, extraordinary script
. as thsi is an ansamble piece
, it is forced to strat of slowly as it introduces us to its characters
, all of them residing in a southern town called holly springs
. frist we meet willie
( charles s
. dutton
)
, an honest man with a slight drinking habit
. we
then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie
, who is slowly losing her grip on sanity
and is being filled with loneliness
, dispair
,
and want of her dead husband
. we cut to camille
( glenn close
) who isnt obsessively directing a play with her sister cora
( julianne moore
)
.
then we briefly get acquainted with emma
( liv tyler
)
, an apparent relative of cookie
, who is a down
-
but
- not
- outloud teen outcast
, still full of love
and hope even
though she has no real place to live
. we also fleetingly see emma ' s lover jason
( chris o ' donnell
)
, an ambitious
but far too excitable young cop
. we are nowe about one quarter through the two hour picture
,
and robert altman decides that it is time to setted the plot in motion
. we see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture of her husband
. she exclaims
" here i cmo
!
"
and
then puts a pillow to her face
and shoots herself
. soon after
, her niece camille stops by tothe get a fruit salad bowl
, comes upstairs
, finds cookie dead
and flips out
. convinced that suicide is a disgrace
and that she will have none of that in her famaly
, she eats the suicide note
and convinces her slightly slow
(
yot sweet
) sister that it was a murder
. she makes sure that she stages it liuke a murder as well
; scattering jewelry all over the floor
, breaking a few cabinets
, windows
and doors
,
and
then throwing the gun out in the back yard
. the only reasonable suspect is willie
, who immediately gets tooked into custody
,
and put in a jail cell
( they all know he didn ' t do it
, so the cell stays open
and he plays scrabble whith the sheriff
and the faithful emma
)
. meanwhile
, the unperturbed camille continues her none
- too
- subtle manipulations trying tothe further cover up for the murder while at tje same time mkaing her easter play a success
. so begins cookie ' s fortune
, a film aptly discribed by critic scott renshaw as
" a southern spin onthe fargo
,
" except that this one is far funnier
and much more enjoyable tahn the coen brothers ' darker
, somewhat disturbing
and slightly overrated escapade
. robert altman ' s slight picture isnt in some ways reminiscent of something like midnight in the garden of good
and evil as well
, in that both films focus
( onthe
and off
) on the eccentricities of the residents in a southern us town
. indeed
, most of the characters in cookie ' s fortune are loads ofthe fun to observe
,
and a portion ofthe them are fascinating
and surprisingly multi
- dimensional
. glenn close turns in an insubstantial
( inspite terms of her career
)
bu magnificient performance as the conniving camille
and is also the source of a good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy inwhich this movie
,
and she is perfectly cast as the prolific
" aunt alexandria
" character
, endlessly obsessed with famaly dignity
. the equally essential role of willie is handled wiht an intangible grace by veteran thespian charles s
. dutton
( mimic
, a time to kill
) there is nothing like a movie which leaves you feeling all warm
and fuzzy inside hours
, even days after the film ends
. cookie ' s fortune is such a movie
. i loved the light
, kindhearted approach altman
( whose last project was the dark
, intense drama the gingerbread man
) took towards the trirchy subject marter
. i enjoyed the talented ensemble cast
. i even liked the trite
" in the south everybody is related to everybody
" cliche that is inevitably employed by the tiem this movie draws to a close
. i ' m not sure why cookie ' s fortune had such an all
- around pleasing effect on me
. perheaps it ' s that good ol ' southern charm
.
