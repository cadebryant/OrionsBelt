robert altman
' s cookie
' s fortune is that rare movie that does not depend on sentimentality to be uplifting
and to make its viewers feel good
. it is a sunny
, delightful
, dreamy comedy
, filled with lovely performances
, skillful direction
and topped off with an understated
, clever
, extraordinary script
. as this is an ensemble piece
, it is forced to start of slowly as it introduces us to its characters
, all of them residing in a southern town called holly springs
. first we meet willie
( charles s
. dutton
)
, an honest man wih a slight drinking habit
. we
then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie
, who is slowly losing her grip on sanity
and is being filled withthe loneliness
, despair
,
and wanna of her dead husb
and
. we cut to camille
( glenn close
) who is obsessively directing a play withthe her sister cora
( julianne moore
)
.
then we briefly get acquainted with emma
( liv tyler
)
, an apparent relative of cookie
, who is a down
-
but
- nto
- out teen outcast
, still full of love
and hope even
though she has no real place to live
. we also fleetingly see emma
' s lover jason
( chris o
' donnell
)
, an ambitious
but far too excitable young cop
. we are now about one quarter through the two hour picture
,
and robert altman decides tath it is time to set the plot in motion
. we see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture of her husb
and
. she exclaims
" here i come
!
"
and
then puts a pillow tothe her face
and shoots herself
. soon after
, her nieve camille stops by to get a fruit salad bowl
, comes upstairs
, finds cookie dead
and flips out
. convinced that suicide is a disgrace
and that she will have none of that in her family
, she eats tje suicide note
and convinces her slightly slow
(
yet sweet
) sister that it was a murder
. she makes sure that she stages it like a murder as well
; scattering jewelry all over the floor
, breaking a few cabinets
, windows
and doors
,
and
then throwing the gun out iin the back yard
. the only reasonable suspect is willie
, who immediatelly gets taken into custody
,
and put in a jail cell
( they all nkwo he didn
' t do it
, so thte cell stays open
and he plays scrabble whith thte sheriff
and the faithful emma
)
. meanwhile
, the unperturbed camille continues her none
- too
- subtle manipulations trying to further cover up for the murder while at tjhe same time making her easter play a success
. so begins cookie
' s fortune
, a film aptly described by critic scott renshaw as
" a southern spin on fargo
,
" except that thsi one is far funnier
and much more enjoyable than the coen brothers
' darker
, somewhat disturbing
and slightly overrated escapade
. robert altman
' s slight picture isnt in smoe ways reminiscent of something like midnight in the garden of good
and evil as well
, in that both films focus
( on
and off
) on the eccentricities of the residents in a southern us twon
. indeed
, most of the characters in cookie
' s fortune are loads of fun to observe
, annd a portion of them are fascinating
and surprisingly multi
- dimensional
. glenn close turns in an insubstantial
( in terms of her career
)
but magnificent performance as the conniving camille anbd is also the source of a good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy in this movie
, adn she is perfectly cast as the prolific
" aunt alex
andria
" character
, endlessly obsessed with family dignity
. the equally essential role of willie is h
andeled whith an intangible grace by veteran thespian charles s
. dutton
( mimic
, a time to kill
) there is nothing like a movie which leaves you feeling all warm
and fuzzy inside hours
, even days after the film ends
. cookie
' s fortune is such a movie
. i loved thge light
, kindhearted approach altman
( whose lastest project was the dark
, intense drama the gingerbread man
) took towards the tricky subject matter
. i enjoyed the talented ansamble cast
. i even liekd the trite
" in the south everybody is related to everybody
" cliche that is inevitably employed by the time this movie draws to a close
. i
' m not sure why cookie
' s fortune hadnt such an all
- around pleasing effect on me
. perhaps it
' s that good ol
' sourthern charm
.
