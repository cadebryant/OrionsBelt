wiht his last two films
- shine
and snow falling on cedars
- australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out ther
,
and his latest
, hearts in atlantis
, is no differnt
. its structure
- beginning
and endig in present day with one long flashback in the middle
- is similair to the green mile
, which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books
. the parallels don
' t end there
, either
. atlantis was adapted by william goldman
, who had previously penned the big
- screen version of misery
and is in the process of working on the script for king
' s dreamcatcher
. even the film
' s content is a bit reminiscent of mile
. in fact
, it
' s the perfect blend of the feel
- good
' 60s nostalgia ofthe st
and by me
( also by king
)
and mystical power hokum of mile
. king
' s atlantis is a book comprised of five realted short stories
,
but the main focus here is on the first
(
and longest
) tale
, called low men in yellow coats
( the film
' s title comes fomr the second chapter
)
. it
' s set in 1960 harwich
, connecticut
, where 11
- year
- old bobby garfield
( anton yelchin
) lives iin a boarding house run by his cold
, self
- centered mother elizabeth
( hope davis
, joe gould
' s sceret
)
, who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son
. bobby spends his time with his two closest firends
, john sullivan
( will rothhaar
)
and tomboy carol gerber
( mika boorem
)
, who become something like the kevin
, paul
and winnie of harwich
. when a new tenant moves into the vacant room
, the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan
( anthony hopkins
, hannibal
)
, a mysterous stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobby
' s mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror
. ted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature
( after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday
)
, dispenses prophetic words of wisdom
and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper
and keep his eyes peeled fo the low men
, a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers
. i won
' t go into what these powers are
,
but they
' re considerably toned down from the book
(
and don
' t involve black stuff flying out of ted
' s mouth
, a la mile
)
. atlantis
' persent
- day setting which bookends the film is based on the novel
' s fianl chapter
, titled heavenly shades of night are falling
,
and features david morse
( in
yet another connection tothe the green mile
) as a married
, middle
- aged bobby who learns of the death of both ofthe his childhood friends
and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in whlch he spent his formative years
. atlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks
' cedars
, which is disappointing bu underst
andable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski
, the oscar
- nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski
' s red
. the acting is solid from everyone
, including hopkins
, who never once makes you think of dr
. lecter
. most impressive are youngsters yelchin
and boorem
, who both had tiny parts in along came a spider
. while i didn
' t really have much of a problem with goldman
' s screenplay
, i do need to point out at least one inconsistancy
. goldman
, for thsoe of you who don
' t read premiere
, writes what seems like an annual critisism of everybody else
' s films
, carefully explaining why they all suck
, make noone sense
and insult their audiences
, while somehow failing to mention the crap that he
' s penned
( like teh general
' s daughter
)
. it
' s mean
- spirited
but fun to read
, mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business
( including michael jackson
, o
. j
.
and robert blake
)
. inthe atlantis
, which is supposed tothe be told through the eyes ofthe young bobby
, one would asume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back
. well
, he
' s not
,
and it doesn
' t make sense
