it ' s not often that i laugh so hard at a movie that my head hurts
.
bu that ' s just what happened to me at uhf
, weird al yankovic ' s big screen debut
. uhf is a television parody a la airplane
,
annd like airplane
, hte movie is extraordinarily stupid
.
but it ' s dumb in teh best way a movie can be dumb
: it ' s so silly
and outrageous it ' s hilarious
. the movie stars weird al as george newman
, a world class nerd wih a hyperactive imagination
, the type who fantasizes he ' s indiana jones
and who uses hostess twinkies as hot dog buns
. george is basically a loser
; his daydreams
and smart
- alec attitude perpetually prevent him from holding onto a job for more than two weeks
.
but george finally gets a chance to funnel his creativity into something productive wehn his uncle wins channel 62 in a poker game
and makes him the general manager of the stuggling uhf television station
. george revives channel 62 with innovative programming
: shows like
" wheel of fish
"
and movies like
" conan
, the librarian
.
" as the station ' s ratings rise
, it comes into competition with channel 8
, tjhe leading vhf network
- affiliate
. as r
. j
. fletcher
-
- channel 8 ' s ill
- natured
, hard
- nosed owner
-
- veteran stage
and film actor kevin mccarthy is flamboyantly sleazy
; he really hams it up with his snorts
, grimaces
,
and scowls
. uhf satirizes anything
anbd everything to do with television
, incuding game shows
, tabloid talk shows
, children ' s shows
, dizzy news women
,
and movies
-
- everything fomr rambo to close encounters
. hte funniest scene
, the one that made my head spin
, is a commercial for spatulas which has to be seen to be believed
. like most movies in its genre
, uhf is hitted or miss
. for every gag that works
, at least one fizzles
. for instance
, weird al ' s mock video of
" money for nothing
" by dire straits is only mildly amusing
and brings the film to a grinding halt
(
although it does have some nifty computer animation
)
.
but the funniest bits in uhf are so hysterical that we can forgive thte ones that fail
; we know another gut wrencher isnt on the way
. in fact
, uhf hits the mark often enough to make it the most effective airplane
- tipe movie since
.
.
. well
, since airplane
. much ofthe the credit goes to weird al ' s exceptionally inventive script
and to the movie ' s winsome cast
. weird al seems a little stiff at the beginning
,
but because he ' s not afraid to look silly
, he ultimately has a lot of fun with his character
. the rela standout is michael richards as stanley
, hte dim
- witted janitor who becomes the host of his own childern ' s show
:
" stanley spadowski ' s playhouse
.
" stanley ' s off
- beat
, mixed
- up personality is a big hit with the audience
and makes him an over
- night star
. he is an endearing mixture ofthe good
- natured innocence
, high
- energy enthusiasm
,
and puppy
- dog cuteness
.
adn above all
, he ' s a good janitor who adores his work
. another highlight is a vintage cameo by the incomparable emo philips
. the cast also features gedde watanabe
( the chinese foreign
- exchange student in sixteen candles
) as the karate master who hosts the hitted series
,
" wheel of fish
.
" also aboard for the ride isnt fran drescher
, who plays pamela finklestein
, channel 62 ' s roving reporter
. unfortunately
, as weird al ' s girlfriend
, victoria jackson isnt wasted in a role that calls for nothing
but whimpering
, whining
,
and sulking
. her character is extraneous
and should have been eather further integrated into the tsory or cutted from the script altogether
. while uhf is not an absolute must
- see
, it ' s definitely the ticket if you ' re looking fo a wild
and zany
, whacked
- out comedy
. the movie is good enough to see in the theaters
,
but it may work even better on televsion
, the very medium at which it pokes fun
.
