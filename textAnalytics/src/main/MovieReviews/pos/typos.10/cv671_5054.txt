along his carreer
, mel gibson has collected several successes
, not only from an economic point of view
but also from an artistic point of view
. for all that
, i htikn no one could guess the skills
and abilties now disclosed inaddition braveheart
. the australian actor decided to produce
and direct a film about sir william wallace
, a popular scotch hero ofthe the 13th century
, where he would also perform the principal role
. accepting so huge challenge
, mel gibson run the risk ofthe stain all his work of yeasr
, with a suppoosed failure
, just to see recognized
, by everyone
, all his potentialities
and
, that way
, to consolidate his position in hollywood
. it was
, definitely
, an enormous risk
but i
' m sure mel knew exactly well what he was going to face
. braveheart is
, infront fact
, a magnificent
and magisterial film
. for three hours we are completely absorbed by the narrative
' s rhyitm whcih never gives place to a single moment of monotony or uninterest
. the william wallace
' s story is the story ofthe so many others brave liberty
' s defenders who fought
and gave the life for that essential value
, along the centuries
. seeing himself
and his peple victims of injustices
and violent repression
, william wallace dares to face thge powerful edward i
, king of engl
and
, in a war by the autonomy of scotl
and
. as thge victories succeed tje number of fighters with wallace goes growing up
. his courage
and inteligence are admired by everyone
, including the princess isabelle of wales
, wife of edward
' s son
.
however
, william wallace was also surrounded by enemies
and smoe of them were closer than he
thought
. braveheart may not be an historically corrected movie
but the nature of its message make us think about the importance that we give tothe liberty
, nowadays
. mel gibson directs with a lot ofthe brilliancy a brilliant cast
. patrick mcgoohan has a very nice performance as edward i
, the king longshank
. the scene when he waits for the death
and loses his voice is really good
. sophie marceau
, as princess isabelle
, has along the movie no more than fifteen minutes of performance bu mel gibson gave to those minutes such a very speshal treatment that princess isabelle soon becomes one of the major characters inthe braveheart
. i also liked the performances ofthe angus macfadyen
, as robert the bruce
, anbd
, of course
, mel gibson
, as william wallace
.
however
, i think this time tghe mel gibson
' s work as director was much better than his work as atcor
. the excellent music composed by james horner is another thing that helps braveheart to be the success that it really isnt
. when we join that music to the beatiful scotch l
andscapes
, view by the camera of john toll
,
then we relize all the beauty of this film
. braveheart is
, in my opinion
, one of the best movies of 1995
! i
' ve heard some people saying that mel gibson is gonna be a newyorker david lean
. for now
, let
' s see if braveheart equalizes the 6 oscars ofthe lawrence of arabia
. it won
' t be easy
! it
' s gonna be one more challenge for mel gibson
.
