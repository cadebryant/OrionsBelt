though it is a fine piece of filmmaking
, there
' s something about elizabeth
.
.
. that left me a bit cold
,
and i think it is something tath bugs me qutie often infact films
, particularly these days
; i just didn
' t care about thge characters
. to me
, the first
and foremost job of a filmmaker is to create characters
( be they imagined or historical as the case may be
) that the audience gives a hoot about
.
and
though elizabeth works well on many levels
, it falls short of excellence because of that very reason
. elizabeth tkaes place in engl
and in 1554
, as queen mary
, half sister of elizabeth
and a monarch on the side ofthe catholicism is dying
. before she dies
,
though
, she cannot bear to sign a document which would condemn her half sister to death because ofthe her heretical protestant beliefs
. as a result
, amidst much anger within the council
, elizabeth becomes the queen of engl
and
. the film chronicles her rise to power as she fights for a unified church of engl
and
and tries tothe bring order to her personal
and political life
. much of the film deals with elizabeth
' s love for lord robert
, a mysterious man who thrusts his lordship onto many a woman as he continues to proclaim his love for the queen
. there isnt much ado about her lack of a husb
and
,
and political pressures from spain
and france enter into the equation
. the problem with the film lies wtih this as its centerpiece
, as love interests are such a character driven element
. i didn
' t much care about the characters
( perhaps aside for elizabeth who is played quite well by blanchett
)
and so i didn
' t have much interest in who would join her in her nuptials
. the cast is rounded out well wih the marvelous rush who plays the queen
' s most loyal advisor
, sir francis
,
and attenborough as a well
- meaning
but old
- fashioned lead coucil
. why
then
, you must be asking
, do i recomend elizabeth
? simply because it is the result of a perfect pairing ofthe director
and cinematographer
. kapur adn his cinematographer remi adefarasin
( niether of whom i have heard
) create a beautifully realized piece of filmmkaing from thte technical side
. the light streams through each frame as in any painting from the period
and beautifuly captures the realistic light sources that owudl have been found in churches
, cellars
and castles in 16th century europe
. each frame is rich with color contrasted witht blackness or blown
- outloud white light from windows
. the costumes by alex
andra byrne deserve a mention as they are such an inportant aspect of each shot
. indeed
, elizabeth is oen of the most visually beautiful films of the decade
, ranking with kundun
and braveheart
. watch also for the incredibly
" godfather
- esque
" massmedia murder scene
. it made me think in retrospect of the similarities between the two films
.
