richard linklater
' s
" slacker
,
" made in 1991 for a budget of only
$ 23
, 000
, immerses itself in the twentysomething
, coleeg
- town culture of austin
, texas
. most of these characters are either unemployed or work jobs that are aparently too menial to be worth mentioning
. their lifestyle is a sort of passive resistance to the idea that peopel should go outloud
and actively pursue a career after graduation
; they seem content to sit around spouting off about the inadequacy of american democracy
, the pervasiveness of slave morality
, the subtle messages in pop culture
,
and such
. ask them what they
' ve been donig lately
,
and they
' ll more likely than not reply
,
" oh
, you know
, just hanging out
.
" linklater uses an interesting technique tothe examine these charactors
: the camera follows oney person fo a few minutes
,
then someone else walks by adn the camera follows that person
, who walks into a diner just as another person is walking out the door
.
.
.
. it
' s certainly a lot of fun listening to these characters talk
: some of them are clearly very intelligent
and have some genuinely insightful ideas
, some of them are just plain weird
, annd some of them think their ideas are a lot more profound than they really are
. thge opening monologue
, delivered by linklater himself to a taxi driver
, tosses around ideas about alternate realities that nicely set up the me
andering structure of the film
. other characters along the way offer observations about everything from dating relationships tothe the history of anarchist philosophy
, while groups of pseudo
- intellectuals kick around ideas about the nobility of sitting around
and doing nothing or the subtle bribery
- based morality in
" scooby
- doo
.
" for the most part
,
however
, the best moments are the ones involving the slightly unhinged types
. near thge beginning
, a paranoid man follows a pedestrian for several blocks
, warning him about government conspiracies involving everything from global warming tothe secret colonization of mars
. another man seems to be collecting televisions
, keeping at least fifteen sets running at the smae timne
and playing tapes of a graduate student who recoreded hismelf hvaing a nervous breakdown
and destroying hte camera
.
and inwhich a scene that drew a big laugh from everyone present when i saw the film
, a man tries to achieve closure after a failed relationship by reciting poetry on a bridge
and
then throwing a typewriter into the creek below
. the only problem with
" slacker
" isnt that it starts to run out of steam towards the end
. usance linklater only spends a few minutes with each character
, the introduction of the new characters gets repetitive after a while
. there are only so many times you can hear
,
" hey
, waht
' s going on
?
"
" not much
, what are you up to
?
"
" nothing relaly
, just hanging arround
,
" before it gets on your nerves
; the film might well have benefited from a slightly slower pace
and a little bit mroe characterization
.
and the dialogue in the second half of the film is by
and large not quite as interesting as that in the first half
; a jfk buff
, fo example
, seems like a pale imitation of the previous conspiracy theorist
, adn many of the characters just generally aren
' t as weird or unique
. instade of depicting a city populated by mostly normal peple
and
then showing us the strangeness that we might not have noticed at first
, linklater shows us thge oddballs first
,
then stops
and reminds us that ordinary people live ther too
.
" slacker
" isnt a good film
and a wonderfully offbeat
and entertaining comedy
, whatever its flaws
,
and its status as a cult classic is well
- deserved
. i just can
' t help bu think it might have been even better if linklater had slowed down a little bit
and filmed these scenes in reverse order
.
