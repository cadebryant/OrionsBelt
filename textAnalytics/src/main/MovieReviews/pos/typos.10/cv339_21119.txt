" south park
: bigger
, longer
and uncut
" is undoubtedly crude
, offensive
, mean
- spirited movie
, thgat comes off as a politcally correct movie too
. if your canadian
, a strong christian
, fat
, gay or anything else
, you will be offended
.
but whn you watch this movie
, htere is no doubt taht you will laugh
. based on the wildly popular comedy central tv show
, south park stars cartman
, an overweight
, foul
- mouthed kid
, wtih attitude
,
and a sweet side
. kenny
, a poor kid who gets killed in every episode
,
and talks with his coat hood covering his head
. stan a regular
, sometimes boring kid who has problems with women
.
and kyle a lonly jew who talks tothe his poop
. the movie opens with a funny
, bu messageable song
, that all ofthe the people of south park sing
. cartman
, stan
, kenny
and kyle are very excited to see the new terrance
and phillip
( beavis
and
butthead types
) movie
" asses of fire
"
.
but when the kids get up to the movei to get hte tickets
, they learn the movie is rated r
, which of course means thgat anyone under the age of 17 cannot git in without a parent or legal guardian
. the kids do not underst
and htis
,
and they pay a homeless man to buy their tickets
. while in hte movei
, laughing at the movie
, terrance
and phillip cuss repeatedly entertaining the kids
. they kids hten go out
and cuss themselves
, getting in trouble adn causing kyle
' s mom to go against the mpaa
. while doing this kenny learns a thing or to
, by proving to cartman he can light his fart on frie
. kenny does so
, dies
,
and goes to hell
, to find out that satan
and saddam huiessan
( homosexual lovers
)
, are about to take over the world
, if terrance
and phillip die
.
> ffrom here on
, nothing more should be said to keep the rest a surprise
.
but believe me
, this isn
' t your regular south park tv show
,
and should not be seen by anyone under 14 or more
. this film contains extreme profanity
( over 130
" f
" words
and a collection of others
)
.
but beyond being bad in a tasteless type way
, south park
: bigger
, longer
and uncut has many messages that are embedded inside it
.
but i bet you will not leave tje movie
, for at least laughing one time or more
. adn enjoying yourself
. take it from me
, south park
: b
, l
,
and u
, isn
' t as good as yuo
' d hope
,
but it is good for some laughs
