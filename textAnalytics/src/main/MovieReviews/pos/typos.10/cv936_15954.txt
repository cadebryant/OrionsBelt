it
' s tough to really say something nice about a tipe ofthe person who
' s so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had isnt now gone
, bu by god
,
" american history x
" does it
, annd forthe that
, i commend it
. it not onyl takes balls
but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo
- nazi skinhead
, a kind of person who dedicates thier lives to hating anyone who
' s not what they are
,
and this film wisely
and miracurously puls it off
. the subject of this film is one of them
,
but he is worse than one of yhe blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack
. he
' s the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage
,
and
then in another brilliant stroke
, justifies it with political propog
anda tht makes eerie sense when he speaks
. he
' s so utterly convincing as a public speaker
and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process
. his name is derek vinyard
,
and he
' s played by edward norton with so much fire
and intensity that when he speaks he
' s almost as convincing
and arresting a public speaker as
, say
, malcom x
. when we first see him
, he
' s clean shaven
, whith a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast
, a devlish goatee
,
and he
' s attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing
but his white boxers
and carrying a h
andgun in his h
and that never seems tothe run out of bullets
, at least when he doesn
' t need them
. he so believes in his convictions that he
' s willing to put his beliefs to tjhe test
, even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison
, if only for a couple years
.
" american history x
" is about derek
, how he became a neo
- nazi skinhead
, how he rose to power
, how he ws rehabilitated in prision after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car
and more to dont with proving himself
,
and how he tried to save others
, namely his younger brother
, from making the same mistake
. we see him at all of theese stages
- as a smart teenager
, a vicious hate monger
, a man having an epiphany
,
and the man who trys to correct what he
' s done before
-
and in all of these
, we get a portrail of a man from all sides
. or at least
, that
' s the intention
. the film
' s framing divice is his brother
, danny
( edward furlong
, perpetually looking about 13
)
, also now a skinhead
,
and how his principal
, bob sweeney
( avery brooks
, who i jstu found outloud was or is teh captain on star trek
' s deepo space 9
)
, is trying to
" corect
" him
. when the film opens
, danny has just written a book report on
" mein kampf
,
" l
anding him in trouble with sweeney
, which causes him to mkea him write a paper on derek
' s life anbd how it has gotten him nowhere
. coincidentally
, this day is the day derek is released from prison
,
and when we see him
, he
' s cleaned
- up
, not as buff
,
and has a full head of hair
. he
' s just as intelligent
, bu still very rough along the edges
,
but he
' s wisened up
. he
' s no longer controlled by his anger at blacks
and jews
,
and tries to persuade danny
, who
' s becoming what derek was before
, to give up his lifestyle
.
but danny won
' t
. he goes tothe a large skinhead beer bash
, meets with the skinhead leader
( stacy keach
)
,
and thne discovers that derek is as opposed tothe neo
- nazi
- dom as he was for it a couple ofthe years ago
. the film circles around this
,
then spins off into non
- linear flashbacks
, all done iin black
and white
. we mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead
, living in venice beach
, organizing vicious
and quasi
- sadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white
, middle
- class teenagers usance they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work
,
and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action
and how illegal immigrants
and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this ocuntry was built on
. tothe them
, the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop
,
and he not only speaks elloquently
, forcefully
,
and intelligently
, bu he backs everything up with political reasons
, justifying their rage at least to them
.
and frighteningly enough
, much of what he says sounds true
.
" american history x
" is a collection ofthe really graet scenes
and moments
, rather thna a cohesive
, great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next
. in it
, there are some of the best scenes i
' ve seen all year
. one scene features a dinner between derek
' s family
, adn his mother
' s newest boyfriend
( played with reserve by eliott gould
)
, a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek
' s rightist views
, launching the scene into a fit of rige
and anger that builds unparalled emotions in tghe audience
( gould
' s reaction to derek
' s final summation is unnerrving
)
. another scene uses humor
and traditionnal macho sex talk to build a friendship
and a nice connection betweeen derek
and a black co
- worker
( guy torry
) while folding laundry in prison
.
and another soon
- tothe
- be
- classic is atually divided in two
: the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail
, which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year
. there
' s much more to appreciate
, liuke the acting
, which isnt uniformly good
, with st
and
- outs comming fomr avery brooks
, beverly d
' angelo
( as the long
- suffering mother
)
,
and gould
( who has one horrible line
,
but other than tyhat
, comes off with the best performance he
' s given in what seems like a really long time
)
. norton walks off with the film
,
though
, comming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone nto doing an adequate job to rubble
. iin only the fifth movie of his career
, norton has invented himself as noe of the most reliable
and intense actors ofthe his generation
,
and maybe the best
. there
' s nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie
, spewing out lines with such authority that he comm
ands all attention from the audience
, coming off witht power similar tothe that of a young maron br
ando
. that he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing
. sadly enought
, this isn
' t going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be
. it
' s too unambitious
and even a little contrived to really take off as either a powerfull statement or an emotional masterpiece
. the endig
, especially
, isnt pencilled in from otehr movies
, tossed in just so teh emotional keyboard can be trounced upon
. some of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches
( kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the
" fat skinhead
,
" whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more
)
,
and even the dramatic arc isn
' t as well travelled
. furlong
' s danny never seems to really be learning a lesson
, since the flashbacks refuse to sohw his point of view
,
and when he decides to make a change by the end
( which was inevitable
)
, it doesn
' t seem like it hasnt actually arrived there
. even derek
' s descent into skinhead
- dom doesn
' t seem justified
.
though his fireman father
( william russ
, the dad from
" boy meets world
,
"
and don
' t ask me how i know that
) is killed by a black junkie
,
and even before he speaked againnst affirmative action intelligently
, there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs
. as such
, one can see why the director
, tony kaye
, wnated to have his name removed
. sorta
.
" american history x
" is a very good movie
,
and i was very moved by it
,
but it could be a lot better
,
and the probelm seems to be that the cut as it is is not up tothe what he claims to be his potential
. somewhere
, he claims
, there lies a tony kaye cut
,
and that was to be the true cut until it wass viewed by norton
, who
then ordered another cut
,
and that is thus
.
al
though he aimed for the directing credit to go to
" alan smithee
,
" the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by its director
, it wasn
' t allowed to him
, under the grounds that once you disown a film
, you can not badmouth it
(
but relaly
, that
' s the macguffin
- no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval
)
. kaye
' s right inwhich that it
' s not uv to par
, even if he
' s nto referring to normal par
but rather his own personal par
. this will nto be a
" do the right thing
" forthe the late 90s
. yot it still gets its point across intelligently
, anbd backs it up with its story
( its message
, that one cannot be so enwrapped in noe
' s own beliefs or pain
and suffering will occur
, is literally said over tghe narration
, unfortunately
)
.
and even if it isn
' t perfect
, at least when avery brooks turns to norton after he has been beaten
and raped in prison
,
and asks him if anything he
' s done has made his life any better
, it realy hits a nerve
, not only inaddition derek
,
but also in the audiance
.
