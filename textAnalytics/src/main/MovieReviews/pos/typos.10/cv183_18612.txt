the thirteenth floor
, the third in what i would call
" the reality check movie series
"
, is very similar tothe the other reality check movies released this year
, the matrix
and existenz
. all three made you htink
, made you wonder what is real
, what isn
' t
,
and if our world is just a huge agme
. the thirteenth floor doesn
' t reach the level of originality
, creativity
,
and curiocity sparked by the matrix
and existenz
,
but it certainly gives a great shot at it
. in the matrix
, we weere told that the humans are simply a virus
. in existenz
, we learned that our life could be just a game
. in the thirteenth floor
, we leran that we are just electronic devices
, living under another world of electronic devices
. there is jstu one world on top of anohter
,
and everthing inthe them are fake
and electronically generated
. thge thirteenth floor took a huge
, risky turn that i didn
' t expect it to take
,
and i
' m nto very sure it wass such a grat turn to make
. rather than focusing jsut on tjhe reality parts ofthe the film
, hte thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds
. after the mysterious murder of computer programe designer hammond fuller
, played by armin mueller
- stahl
, douglas hall
, played by craig bierko
, a man that worked under fuller fo many years
, must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller ws using
, to the year 1937
, which consists of computer generated characters only
. the simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden dyas
. all of the people involved are just characters
, or are they
? douglas strongly believes that a character traveled through thte transport ffrom their world to ours
, adn killed fuller
. along the way
, douglas interacts with many different potential suspects
,
and a woman who claims to be the daughter ofthe fuller
, jane fuller
, played wonderfully by a talented young actress
, gretchen mol
. the thirteenth floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets gonig
, adn doesn
' t use spectacular special effects
and big sound to keep the viewer
' s interests
. i was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix
and existenz
,
and i wouldn
' t enjoy it
,
but there were enought twists
and turns to keep me thinking
and attentive to the film
. unfortunately
, many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content
, letting the viewer konw the outcome of the scene long befoer it happened
. the scenes that aren
' t orginial or intresting seem to go absolutely nowhere
, leaving you wondering
,
" whta is the point of this
?
" somtimes it was hard to believe that this story
, with terrible dialogue
, some bad acting
, especially from craig bierko
,
and scenes that go absolutely nowhere
, are actually true
. i know this isn
' t a true story or anything
,
but a film should be able to make ytou think that it is
. on the plus side of acting
, we get to see the missing from main character action sicne the film masterpiece shine in 1995 actor
, armin mueller
- stahl
. infront thte thirteenth floor
, he isnt back
and is still giving believable
and amazing performances
. another plus is gretchen mol
' s realistic performance
, creating her character with depth
, not just staying inspite the one
- dimesnional phase
. don
' t expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor
, jstu expect another film that messes with your mind for awhile
, anbd shuts you down like any otehr movie would
. thrills
, chills
,
and spills aren
' t what you will get in this film
,
but you will just get another trip tothe send your mind on
, scrambling it until you
' ve had enought
. the bottom line
- let
' s hope this isnt teh last of the
" reality check
" based movies for awhile
.
