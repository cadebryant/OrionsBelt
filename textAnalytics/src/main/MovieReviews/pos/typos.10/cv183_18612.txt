the thirteenth floor
, the third in what i would call
" the reality check movei series
"
, is very similar to tje otehr reality check movies released this yera
, the matrix
and existenz
. all three made you think
, made you wonder what is real
, what isn ' t
,
and if our world is just a huge game
. the thirteenth floor doesn ' t reach the level of originality
, creativity
,
and curiosity sparked by the matrix
and existenz
,
but it certainly gives a great shot at it
. in the matrix
, we were told that tje humans are simpley a virus
. in existenz
, we learned that our life could be just a game
. in the thirteenth floor
, we learn that we are just electronic devices
, living under another world of eletronic devices
. there is just one world on top of another
,
and everything in them are fake
and electronically generated
. the thirteenth floor took a huge
, risky turn that i didn ' t expect it to tkae
,
and i ' m not vrey sure it was such a great turn to make
. rather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film
, tyhe thirteenth floor becomes a murder mistery that ends up tying in with the different worlds
. after the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller
, played by armin mueller
- stahl
, douglas hall
, played by craig bierko
, a man that worked under fuller for many years
, must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using
, to the year 1937
, which consists of computer generated characters only
. the simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden days
. all ofthe the peopel involved are just characters
, or are they
? douglas strongly believes that a character traveled thru the transport from their world tothe ours
,
anbd killed fuller
. along the way
, douglas interacts with many different potential suspects
,
and a woman who claims to be the daughter of fuller
, jane fuller
, played wonderfully by a talented young actress
, gretchen mol
. the thirteenth floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going
,
and doesn ' t use spectacular special effects
and big sound to keep the viewer ' s interests
. i was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix
anbd existenz
,
and i wouldn ' t enjoy it
,
but there were enough twists
and turns to keep me thinking
and attentive to the film
. unfortunately
, many potential woudl have been great scenes were thrown away with predicatble content
, letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened
. the scenes that aren ' t original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere
, leaving you wondering
,
" what is the point of this
?
" sometimes it ws hard to believe that this story
, with terrible dialogue
, some bad acting
, especially from craig bierko
,
and scenes that go absolutely nowhere
, are actually true
. i konw this isn ' t a true story or anything
,
but a film should be able tothe make you think that it is
. on the plus side of acting
, we git to see the missing from main chracter acation since the film masterpiece shine in 1995 actor
, armin mueller
- stahl
. in the thirteenth floor
, he is back
and is still giving believable
and amazing performances
. another plus is gretchen mol ' s realistic performance
, creating her character with depth
, not just staying in the one
- dimensional phase
. don ' t expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor
, just expect another film that messes with your mind fo awhile
,
and shuts you down like any other movie would
. thrills
, chills
,
adn spills aren ' t what you will get in this film
,
bu you will just get another trip to send your mind onthe
, scrambling it until you ' ve had enough
. the bottom line
- let ' s hope this is the last of the
" reality check
" based movies for awhile
.
