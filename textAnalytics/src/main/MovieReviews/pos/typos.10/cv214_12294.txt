capsule
: suprisingly more of a comedy than a straight action flick
, which isn
' t necessarily a bad thing
. not exactlly oscar caliber
,
but one helluva bullet
- riddled good time
. extended review
: you know
, i remember when hitmen weere evil
, murderous scum
. alas
, the times are a
- changin
'
. in a recent string of movies
, hitmen are suddenly wise
- cracking
, fun
- loving killers
- with
- hearts
. tihs brings us tothe hong kong directer kirk wong
' s frist american feature
, the big hit
. oddly enough
, about the same time last year a similar film
, grosse point blank
, was released
. advertised as a quirky comedy with hints of action
, it turned out to hve a suprising dosage of it
. tyhe big hit is quite the opposite
. it wass hyped as
" the newyorker film ffrom producer john woo
"
, so one would it expect lots of stylized killing
and action
. howver
, htere
' s a sore lack of it
, which is about the only thing wrong with the big hit
. tyhe film starts out with mel smiley
and his cohorts doing a job on a white slaver
. mel
, played by mark wahlberg in a dopey
, milquetoast role
, is a killing machine
; he flips
, spins
, even breakdances whilst popping caps
. sadly
, he doesn
' t get a chance to do much of it
. except fo the beginning setted piece
and the last 20 twenty minutes or so
, the film is in comedy mode
. the action
, at least what there is of it
, is prime cut stuff
. wong
, after numerous hong kong features
, makes quite a nice u
. s
. de
but
.
however
, his pacing is a bit off
, with the action sequences onyl bookending the movie
and not lasting long enough
. they start off electrifying
and fresh
,
but just kinda stop
. normally
, this would hamper a movie to the point of being unenjoyable
. luckily
, we have ben ramsey
' s screenplay
, a bitingly funny piece of work
. the onyl problem is there might be too much humor
, one joke makes you laugh so hard you miss the next few
. some of best gags include an oriental film maker down on his luck
and one ofthe mel
' s hitmen pals that has just discovered onanism
. the only problem is how some of tyhe minor characters are h
andled
, some being ther only for a laugh
, which sometimes works
, sometimes doesn
' t
. overall
, the big hit may have it
' s flaws
, bu it makes up for them in a stylishly directed
, gut
- wrenchingly funny joyride
. definately one of the better ways to spend two housr
.
