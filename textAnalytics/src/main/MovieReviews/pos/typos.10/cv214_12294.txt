capsule
: suprisingly more of a comedy than a straight acation flick
, whic isn ' t necessarily a bad thing
. not exactly oscar caliber
,
but one helluva bullet
- riddled good time
. extended review
: you know
, i remember wehn hitmen were evil
, murderous scum
. alas
, the times are a
- changin '
. in a recent string of movies
, hitmen are suddenly wise
- cracking
, fun
- loving killers
- with
- hearts
. tihs brings us to hong kong directer kirk wong ' s first american feature
, the big hit
. oddly enough
, about the same time last year a similar film
, grosse point blank
, was released
. advertised as a quirky comedy with hints of action
, it turned out to have a suprising dosage of it
. the big hit is quite the oposite
. it was hyped as
" the new film from producer john woo
"
, so noe would it expect lots of stylized killing
and action
.
howver
, there ' s a sore lack of it
, which is about the only thing wrong with the big hit
. the film starts out whith mel smiley
and his cohorts doing a job on a white slaver
. mel
, played by mark wahlberg in a dopey
, milquetoast role
, is a killing machine
; he flips
, spins
, even breakdances whilst popping caps
. sadly
, he doesn ' t get a chance tothe do much of it
. except for the beginning set piece
anbd the last 20 twenty minutes or so
, the film is in comedy mode
. the action
, at least what there is of it
, is prime cut stuf
. wong
, after numerous hong kong features
, makes quite a nice u
. s
. debut
.
however
, his pacing is a bit off
, with the acation sequences only bookending the movei
and not lating long enought
. they start off electrifying
and fresh
,
but just kinda stop
. normaly
, this woudl hamper a movie to the point of being unenjoyable
. luckily
, we ahev ben ramsey ' s screenplay
, a bitingly funny piece of work
. the only problem is there might be too much humer
, one joke makes you laugh so hard you miss tje next few
. some of best gags include an oriental film maker down on his luck
and one of mel ' s hitmen pals that has just discovered onanism
. the only problem is how some of the minor characters are handeled
, some being there only for a laff
, which sometimes works
, sometimes doesn ' t
. overall
, the big hit may ahev it ' s flaws
,
but it makes up for them in a stylishly directed
, gut
- wrenchingly funny joyride
. definately one of the better ways to spend two hours
.
