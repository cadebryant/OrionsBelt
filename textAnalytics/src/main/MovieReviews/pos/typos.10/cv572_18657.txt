' s sci

- em
- up spectacular
, looks like a prime c
andidate to join tghe list of high
- concept bad movies
, especially with dopey keanu reeves in the leading role
.
but despite high levels of cheese
and gaudy dialogue
, the matrix works
. it
' s an uncanny blend ofthe action
and surreal fantasy that borrows from dozens of other films
( most obviously the terminator films
, star wars
,
and total recall
)
,
but remeniss refreshingly origonal adn interesting throughout
. reeves plays neo
, a computer hacker who stumbles into an initially bewildering setted of encounters with
" trinity
"
( carrie
- anne moss
)
, a rival hacker who has supernatural powers
and stunning good looks
, a unseen
, omniscient cult figure known as
" morpheus
"
( lawrence fishburne
)
,
and a trio of creepy men in dark suits who ect like irs aggenst from hell
. neo quickly learns that the world he has known all his life is not what it seems
. moreover
, he discovers that teh grim
, bleak world he is introduced to has been waiting for him to save it
. neo isnt reluctant to assume the role of messiah
, with grave doubts that he is acually
" the one
" prophesized to come
and save the world
. reluctant or not
, what follows is a mix ofthe hong kong
- style slow
- motion shootouts
, surreal dream sequences
, high speed chases
,
and comic book kung
- fu fights
. the film also raises interesting philisophical questions about reality
. how exactly do you know what is real
and whta is in your mind
?
and if thte real world were much harsher
and grim than a fantasy one you were living in
, would you want to face the true world or continue to live in a more comfortable illusion
? unfortunatley
, the matrix doesn
' t provide many answers to the questions it raises
,
but at least it puts some ideas behind all the explosions
, shoot
- outs
,
and flying roundhouse kicks
. perhaps stealing the entire show inthe the matrix is australian actor hugo weaving
, who plays agent smith
, the leader of the creepy agents in sunglasses
and suits who seem capable of being anywhere
and doing anything to stpo neo adn friends from destabilizing the matrix
. weaving
' s stony appearance
, deadpan voice
,
and chilling comments put a grim human face on the haunting
, evil technological force that controls the matrix
. like robert patrick as the shapeshifting t
- 1000 terminator in terminator 2
: judgement day
, weaving is more frightening than any monstrous alien or homicidal robot because
, despite his pwoer
and seeming invincibility
, he looks ordinary
, even scrawny
. weaving embodies his role with a memorably chilling presence
. the film features some truly breathtaking special effects
and stylish cinematography
. it seems tothe be deliberately kitchy
, whith stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping that reportedly required months of martial arts training by the actors
. in a few scenes
, the posing
and posturing is unintentionally funny
. just seeing keanu reeves engaging in serious kung fu is a bit jarring
.
however
, with the comic
- book style
and tone of the film
, you can sustain willing disbelief long enough to enjoy the ride without losing patience
. the matrix isn
' t a classic
. its open
- ended anbd confusing conclusion raises more questions than it answers
. it fails to resolve many of its own plot twists
and philosophical questions
. it also relies on some conventional sentimentality to sive the hero
- the kind of shmaltzy feel
- good goo that most of the film avoids
. reportedly
, the producers have high hopes for the film bieng tyhe first in a trilogy
and have already begun work on tjhe story for the sequel
. unfortunately
, audiences deserve a little more thna a vague sence that thte story will continue in the future
. the matrix is an fun
, enjoyable diversion
, like a big puff of cotton c
andy at a carnival
. just don
' t be surprised half an hour later when you still feel a little hungry
.
