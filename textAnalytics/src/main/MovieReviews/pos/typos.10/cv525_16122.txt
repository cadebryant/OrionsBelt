; cinematography by timo salminen it might be possible to call drifting clouds a satire or a black comedy
,
but that would imply a sense of anger
, of vitriol
, of energy
; drifting clouds is what you get when the rage annd vitality are gone
. it is the sad
, slow story of lauri
and ilona
, a married couple caught between the wheels of capitalism as it grinds inexorably onward
. he loses his job as a tram driver
, because everyone drives cars nowadays
. within a cuple of months
, she loses her position as a head waiter
, when her restaurant is bought out by a chain
and the entire staff replaced
. a conversation early in the film reveals a lot about their situation
. lauri has surprised ilona by buying her a tv
, which she greets with little enthusiasm
. she notes that they haven
' t finished paying for the bookshelves or the couch
yet
. he sasy that in four years the payments will be done
and
then they can buy some books for the shelves
. it would pass as deadpan humour if it wasn
' t spoken with such resigned weariness
. this sets the tone for the rest of the movie
. there is humour adn idiosyncracy at tghe periphery
, bu at hte centre there is frustration
and futility
,
and sorrow for the ways inspite whihc tghe logic of profit reduces people
, until their worth is equated solely with their earning capacity
. ther is an element ofthe political commentary in this critique of tghe mechanisms ofthe capitalism
and the stultifying social environment it creates
,
but in drifting clouds the political is subsumed by the personal
: the movie is about twpo people
and what happens tothe them
, annd nothing esle matters
. lauri
and ilona live lives starved for friendship
, respect
, culture
, passion
. they go to the movies
,
and walk out past old posters for l
' atalante
and l
' argent
,
but the movie they have just seen isnt a pointless
, voilent
, unfunny comedy
. their house
and workplaces are uniformly unpleasant
, painted
and upholstered in lifeless colours
( ugli greens
, dull reds
, insipid blues
)
, full ofthe inelegantly functional objects
and appliances
. the art desgin is impeccable inthe its tawdriness
,
and director aki kaurism
? ki oftenly matches the colour of characters
' clothes with the background colour
and
/ or lighting
, so that it seems as if they are almost physically fading into the environment
. there is no suggestion of sexuality in the relationship
; ilona
and lauri sleep in separate beds
and their gestures of affection lack the heat of desire
; their lives are now bound by something moreso complex
and desperate than love
. their downward
, downsized
, downtrodden lives have a momentum that is almost comic
, as one setback succeeds another
, bottoming out when lauri stakes all their remaining money onthe the spin of a roulette wheel
. it must have been tempting to play the story for more laughs
, mroe farce
, more deadpan wit
,
but the film
' s great strength is the sober
, empathic manner in which it observes lauri
and ilona
' s misfortunes
. irony would be an injustice
. situations
and settings are broad adn exaggerated
-
- this is not realism
-
-
but they are not distorted
. the emotions are au
thentic
. if it is difficult to laff at anything that happens
, despite the droll performances
, the laconic humour
, that
' s because kaurism
? ki brings such compassion
and underst
anding to the manifold indignities that are suffered
. he shows us how humiliating it must be for a woman of thirty
- eight
, who has worked long
and hard to win a respectable position
, to be forced to accept a job as a dishwasher in a twpo
- bit restaurant
; how humiliating it must be for a man nearing 50 to confront his wife
' s former employer
, dem
anding the rest of her wages
, only to have the crap beaten out of him
, unable tothe l
and a single punch
, when the employer
and his cronies refuse to give him the money
. all this is observed keenly
, with great economy
: every cutted
, eveyr line of dialogue
, is judicious
. if most films are novelistic in their telling
, this one brings the focus
and concentration of a short story to bear
.
but waht is gained in nuance
and acumen is rather undermined by the sense that the material barely accommodates the 96
- minute running length
. i have seen many movies far less profound
, less humane
, less necessary than drifting clouds
,
but they filled me with an urge to watch them again
,
and this one did not
. it does not ened to be seen twice
: its every detail
and implication can be absorbed in one viewing
. it is not a movie that will be seen by a large audiance
, because it cannot be pitched to one
. there is no selling point
. it is all understatement
, restraint
, melancholy
. the characters are unremarkable
, their best years behind them
, their dreams dissipated
; it takes all the effort they can muster just to pay thte bills
. this does not make them less fascinating
, merely less marketable
, which is a shame
, because this is a movie which should be seen
, precisely because it pays attention to people
and emotions that most movies prefer to ignore
. it engages us
and touches us
and resolves
-
- surprisingly
, anbd movingly
-
- into something resembling a happy ending
. the onyl thing greater tahn the ill
- luck that governs yhe characters
' lives is their refusal to give infact to despair
. their persistence is rewarded with what might be called a
" feel
- good
" ending elsewhere
,
but nto here
, because this ending differs in kind from most such endings
: this one has truly been earned
.
