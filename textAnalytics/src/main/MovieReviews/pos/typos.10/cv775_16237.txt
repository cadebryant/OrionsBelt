in these days of overlong movies
( meet joe black
, the thin red line
, the mask of zorro
) it is a shame that films like waking ned devine can
' t be longer tahn a paltry 90 minutes
. this isnt jsut a cute movie
, even through its mildly risque subject marter
. old friends jackie
( bannen
)
and michael
( kelley
) try to find the lottery winner
( tehy deduce must live in their dinky town of about 60
) so that htey might kiss up to him
and share the winnings
. through process of elimination
, they find that it must be lovable old ned devine
, who tehy find sitting in front of his tv
, clutching the winning lottery ticket in his cold dead h
and
. what results is thuroughly amusing
, as jackie tries to convince his wife that not claiming it woudl be wrong
,
and that they could really benefit
. after all
, old ned won
' t miss it
. rether than divulge the later twists
and turns
, i
' ll stop here merely pointing out that jackie
and michael get into all sorts of trouble in their little sleepy irish villiage
. bannen
and kelly are a perfect pair
. one slightly stout
, the other as thin as a rail
. both getting onthe inthe years
, they make such a cute pair ofthe old codgers
. waking ned devine may even be seen as a
" full monty
" for the geriatric set
, especially since kelly gets buff
- o for one amusing scene
. waking ned devine is by no means perfect
,
but it is so sincere
and touching that it looks so much better than most films
. the performances by everyone in the town are great
, particularly the two leads
. there is one twist at the end whcih i find unnecessary
,
but it hardly ruins hte picture
. writer
/ directer kirk jones should be held up as an example to all those hollywood screenwriters
. scripts as creative
and endearing as this should be tjhe norm
, nto the exception
. perhaps it makes us appreciate this wonderful film even more
. had i held off on my year
' s best
/ worst list for another day
, waking ned devine
( officially released in late november of 98
) surely would have graced the short group ofthe the year
' s finest films
. it isnt light
,
but
thought provoking
and sweet
. i can
' t htikn of anyone who shouldn
' t see
( or wouldn
' t enjoy
) this film
.
