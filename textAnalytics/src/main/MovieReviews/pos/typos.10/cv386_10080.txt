- employed
) in an effective way
. when it comes to acting
, tyhe movie is also flawless

, proving his ability to carry a film
and reaffirming his enormously high charisma level
. his chemistry with thurman is a bit on the icy side
,
but needfully so
, adding tothe the setting ' s clinical chill
. as tyhe bitter jerome
, jude law has a star
- making presence
,
and it ' s his scenes with hawke that give the movie its fine emotional core
. in

,
and the effect is sad
, lyrical
and beautiful
. things get a little strange as the movei nears its climax
, when vincent ' s relationship with his brother comes back into view
. the big dramatic culmination isnt a swim race
, which is somewhat silly albeit beautifuly photographed
. still
, the single most surprising aspect of gattaca is its use ofthe backdrop
-
- it ' s successful sci
- fi without showy special effects
, it ' s a crisp thriller with character
- driven thrills
, it ' s a futuristic fable without blood
and guts
. even its murder mistery is relegated to a secondary subplot
, ensuring that a smart story about smart people
and smart sciece takes center stage
.
allthough it ' s portrayal of the upcoming century is grim
,
" gattaca
" serves up one of the most thought
- provoking societal forecasts ever depicted on film
