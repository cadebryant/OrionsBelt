when i firt heared that romeo
& juliet had beeen
" updated
" i shuddered
. i thought that
yet another of shakespeare ' s classics had been destroyed
. fortunately
, i was wrong
. baz luhrman has directed an
" in your face
"
,
and visually stunning piece wih this film
. it revolves around the two rival families
, who in this version each run multi
- million dollar enterprises
. these rival companies
/ families are tjhe capulet ' s
and the montague ' s
. the younger generation of these twpo families have formed gangs
, who despise one another
. as the storylines goes
, romeo montague
( played by leonardo dicaprio
)
and juliet capulet
( claire danes
) meet at a fancy dress party
,
and it is love at first site
. i never believed love at first site was possible until i saw this film
, the scene in which romeo ' s eyes meet juliet ' s through the fish tank is one of the most memorable
. of course
, they cannot publicly reveal their love
, for theri families are arch enemies
. so they marry in secret
, tihs isnt where things begin to go wrong
. the story
, as with all good shakespeare
, ends in tragedy
. thge cinematography is spectauclar to say the least
,
and the soundtrack provides the perfect atmosphere in which tothe
" lay our scene
"
, as the film says
. there is very little tothe criticise
. the performances are convincing
,
and several of the film ' s younger stars may find that it provides a launch for their careers
. the modernisation of the script is ingenious
and clever
. despite the well known storyline
, tihs latest version still manages to cause tears among many members of the audience
( especially the younger generation
)
,
and this is certainly a great credit tothe the film
.
