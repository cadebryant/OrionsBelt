when i saw the trailer for this film
, i laughed harder than i had in quite some time
. while i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it
, i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even yhe most mediocre film look good
. i
' m hapyp to say that there
' s something about mary is not one of those trailer let
- downs
. in fact
, watching this film was quite a fine way tothe spend two hours
. the film opens up in flashback to 1985
, at a high skool infront cumberl
and
, rhode isl
and
. ted stroehmann
( ben stiller
) isnt a social reject who can
' t seem to get a date to the upcoming prom
, until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren
( w
. earl brown
)
, who
' s being harassed by noe of the school jocks
. it seems warren
' s sister is the cumpus queen
, mary jensen
( cameron diaz
)
, who is impressed with ted
' s willingness to st
and up for her defenseless brother
, despite a very real chance of getting beaten up
. mary takes an immeditae liking to ted
and asks him to the prom
. ted was just flattered that she even knew his name
. unfortunately
, prom night isnt ruined wehn ted has an accident with his zipper
( at which every man inaddition the theater will wince
)
,
and is sent to the hospital
. fast forward to the present
, where ted has cleaned himself up
, now writes for a magasine
,
but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years
: mary
, whom he hasn
' t seen since that fateful day
. with the help of his friend dom
( chris elliott
)
, ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy
( matt dillon
) to track down his only love
.
however
, when pat finds mary
, he falls for her too
,
and soon the both of them are competing forthe her affections
. there
' s something about mary is directed by bobby
and peter farrelly
, who brought us dumb
and dumber
and kingpin
. not exactly intelligent comedies
, they are ofthe the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co
- workers to think you had such a great time watching them
. with their current film
, the farrelly brothers have come up with something you
' ll not only enjoy
,
but also won
' t mind talking about the next day at the water cooler
. the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles
, from the subtle to the ridiculous
,
and while a faw of the gags might be offensive tothe some
( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers
' last two films
) they almost all work
. i have not seen many movies inspite the recent past that shoot for the mark
and so often hit it dead onthe
. one minute you
' ll be laughing at something ted says
, adn the next you
' ll be howling at the sight ofthe a dog dragging him across the floor of mary
' s appartment
. one of the great thigsn this film hasnt goign fo it is ben stiller
. he is perfectly cast in the role of ted
, because he
' s a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation
. ted
' s a nice fellow
and tries to do his best
,
but for some reason or another things just don
' t always work out
. it
' s comical
,
but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for tje him
and want him to come outloud on top
. actually
, i
' ve liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid
- eighties
. thte film was like a theatrical trailer forthe a spoof on hte tom cruise
/ paul newman film the color of mney
, entitled the hustler of money
. in it
, stiller played wince
( not vince
) who is taken under the wing of an older man
( played by john mahoney
) to become a big
- time bowling hustler
. it was parody at its finest
, more of which showed up in the short
- lived
" the ben stiller show
" on the fox network in late
' 92
/ eearly
' 93
. liek
" hte critic
"
( which aired on abc
,
then fox
)
, i still mourn that show
' s cancellation
. cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film
,
al
though her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates
,
and some of hte qualities she looks for make mary look paper
- thin at times
.
however
, diaz puls the role off with such panache
and charm
, that you can still see why she
' s got guys jsut falling over each other to be with her
. heck
, i even found her laff to be cute
, even
though i
thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight sohw last week
. my girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn
' t change
,
and you know
, it
' s really true
. he
and ralph macchio must hang out or something
. maybee they live in dick clark
' s pool house
. anyway
, here
' s another good piece of casting
, as dillon slips beautifully into the role of tyhe guy who tries tothe worm his way into mary
' s heart
. the supporting performances are aslo good
. chris elliott has a bigger part thna in the abyss
( yes
, check it out next time
)
,
and less annoying than in cabin boy
. lin shae
, who plays mary
' s neighbor magda
(
and aslo appeared as the l
andlady in kingpin
)
, provides some good laughs
, especially in scenes with her benji
- like dog
, which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film
. lee evans
, as mary
' s friend tucker
, displays a flexibility in acting
and accents which surprises
and contri
butes to an interesting plot twist
. the farrelly brothers
and scriptwriters ed decter
and john j
. strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren
' t any noticeable times where the film drags
. the only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes
. they appear out of nowhere adn actually sing plot
- relevant information right toward tje camera
. it
' s a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film
. after that it got a little annoying
,
and it
' s unfortunate thgat those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow
. fortunately
, filled with sight gags
, humorous lines
,
and solid comedic acting
, there
' s something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater
.
