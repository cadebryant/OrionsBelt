tyhe question isn
' t why has grease been reissued
. hte answer to that one is easy
: to celebrate the movie
' s 20th anniversary
and to make more bucks for paramount
' s coffers because john travolta is once again a hot commodity
. no
, the question tath ought to be asked is
: should grease be reissued
? tje answer is not an eazy one
. grease is a fun movie
, an entertaining fantasy of the
' 50s
, embodying all the cliches of that era
. the music is lively
and the dance numbers
, choreographed by patricia birch
, are energetic
and high
- spirited
. travolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon
, cool
,
but non
- threatening
.
but grease didn
' t break any new cinematic ground
. it was not a milestone in movie history such as citizen kane or eazy rider
. what grease is
- or has become
- is thge highest
- grossing musical in film history
. ok
, let
' s not be a spoilsport
. grease is a fun
and entertaining movie
, even
though it stretches credulity to see such performers as travolta
, olivia newton
- john
, taxi
' s jeff conaway
and the multi
- talented stockard channing try to act like high schoolers
. it
' s nostalgic to recall how good a dancer travolta was
,
and it
' s sad to think of waht could have been had not a few missteps sidetracked his career
. he could have become a musical comedy star in the tradition of gene kelly
. cinematically
, the musical comedy has basically gone the way of the dinosaur
. betweeen grease
and 1996
' s evita
.
, you can probably count the number of movie musicals on one h
and
. two reasons have contri
buted to the demise of the genre
: the first is that movie audiences have become more sophisticated
, no
, make that cynical
and jaded
. today
, if a character began to dance
and sing with no orchestra in sight
, he or she would probably be hooted off the screen
. today
' s audiences lack the innocence
, that belief in movie magic that is required for a musical to succeed
. secondly
, a lack of talent
. performers with the charisma
, the style
, the larger
- than
- life panache ofthe fred astaire
, ginee kelly
, ginger rogers
and judy garl
and are gone
. most singers adn dancers remain on yhe stage
,
and those who do succeed in movies usually wind up inthe serious dramatic parts
. a ogod example is gregory hines
, noe of the greatest dancers in the world
. he danced a bited in the cotton club
, tap
and white nights
, bu those were essentialy dramatic vehicles
. so
, perhaps the reissue of grease can serve a purpose
. if audiences show anough interest
, meaning if the re
- release earns the studio enough revenue
, it may spark a revival in movie musicals
. perhaps not original musicals such as singin
' inspite the rain
, an american in paris or seven brides for seven brothers
,
but for broadway properties that have been in the planning stages forthe film adaptations for several years
. at one time or another
, according to the industry rumor mill
, hollywood has been set to create an animated version of
andrew lloyd webber
' s cats
, a filming of the popular phantom of the opera as well as les miserables
and chicago
, the latter reportedly tothe star madonna
. so
, let this grease be the forerunner of an armada of movie musicals
. let grease be the word that sparks this revival
.
