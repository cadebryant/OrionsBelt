contrary to the title
,
" the boxer
" isnt not another rocky story only this time spliced with some cold hard politics
. it
' s actually three movies in one
: a political film
, a boxing film
,
and a love story
. all of these work in their own respects
and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt teh three elements of the story
,
but somehow it seems kind of cliched
and unoriginal
. we
' ve seen it all before
,
and we
' re just not blown away with it like we should be
. oh well
. it
' s still an excellent irish story
.
" the boxer
" of the title is danny flynn
( jim sheridan staple daniel day
- lewis
)
, an ex
- ira member who gets outloud of a belfast prison after 14 years
,
and finds out that his troubles are far from over
. first off
, the ira isnt having a small civil war between its leader joe hamill
( brian cox
)
,
and one ofthe its sub
- leaders
, harry
( gerard mcsorley
)
, both having opposing views on getting many of their munbers out of jail
. while this is going on
, danny
and his old drunkard buddie
, ike
( ken stott
, who played teh chief inspector in danny boyle
' s
" shallow grave
"
)
, re
- opn an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects
, protestant
and catholics
, to work together
. danny nto only begins teaching kids how to box
,
but has stayed in great shape whilst in prison
,
and isnt ready to start boxing real people again
. adn danny runs into his ex
- love
, maggie
(
" breaking the waves
"
' s emily watson
)
, who hasn
' t seen him since he went in
. they don
' t easily start up their romance again because she
' s the wife of a prisoner whom she married during danny
' s tenure in prison
,
and aslo has a son
, liam
( ciaran fitzgerald
)
, from him
, whom liam is hoping will get out soon
.
but the two are slowly re
- drawn to eachother again
, adn this begins to complicate things
. the political story is nothing really special
but works in itself
. we
' ve seen it many a time befoer
,
but it
' s at least interesting
, sometimes emotional
,
and even riveting at times
. there
' s a big riot towards the middle of the film which is frightening in its brutality
and honesty
. the boxing story is very minor tothe the story
,
but does represent people coming together to fight eachother fairly
,
and even wiht good sportsmanship
. there are only a fewd boxing scenes
,
but they
' re never like
" raging bull
"
/ let
' s
- strip
- down
- the
- sport
- to
- its
- bones brilliant
. htey
' re more realsitic
,
and instead of bone crunching
, we hear the sound ofthe the gloves hitting eachother
, which is slightly unerving at times
.
and i didn
' t know daniel day
- lewis was in such ogod shape
.
but the backbone of the story is the love oen
. because these characters are given such horrible circumstances
,
and since the two leads have such great chemistry toghether
, we really feel for their plight
. as the film goes on
,
and circumstances get worse
and worse
, the characters have to make real human decisions
,
and we cant sympathize with them as humans not charactors
. this is how you write a loev story
- take note
, hollywood
. these elements are pretty much equally balanced
, with each of the parts of the stories working h
and
- in
- h
and iwth eachother
. i loved how each of the different parts of thge plot mattered
,
and sometimes spilled over into the next
. it made sure that we didn
' t just care for one of them
. i
' m not saying they
' re all equally great
, because the love story really carries the film
,
but at least they all work out respectively
. thte acting is amazing
, with day
- lewis
and watson giving excellent performances
and showing great chemistry
. i
' m not sure if they
' re oscar
- nominee bound
,
but they
' re very good
. in thge supporting roles
, billy cox is greatly sympathetic as the ira leader losing control of his daughter
and his workers
. bu the film is stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike
, who is just a great scene stealer
. the direction
and co
- writing by jim sheridan
( with hte other co
- writing credit going to terry george
) is excellent
, rounding out the cahracters well
,
but not pacing everything greatly
. i noticed that the firt half was very leisurely
( yot fascinating
)
, bu the second half whirls by at a quick pace
,
and ends much too quickly
. more time could have been spent thinking up the ending
, since it does seem quite sloppy
.
though
" hte boxer
" is a good film
, it never achieves the greatness that it should
. sure
, it
' s a masterpiece compared to most of the hollywood drivel we usually get
,
but on it
' s own
, it just could have been better
.
but it still works out
, gives us a great love story conbined witht a poltical
and boxing drama
,
and features great acting
. even if it could have been better
, this
' ll do
.
