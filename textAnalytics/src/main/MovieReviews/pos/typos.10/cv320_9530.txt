with the realease of gattaca
, i began to wonder why all science fiction films deal with destructive aliens
, or aliens in general
. hollywood hasnt given audiences plenty of thrills wih those aline films
, bu what wass usually lacking was a good story
.
.
.
and good characters
.
.
.
and good acting
, etc
( contact being the exception
)
.
and for some reason
, hollywood has never taken a look at the aliens here on earth
. the closest
, that i have seen anyway
, was 2001
: a space odyssey
, which made mankind an alien race themselves
, being dwarfed by the technology which they created
. now comes gattaca
, another film about technology reigning supreme
, except here on our planet
. the difference between 2001 anbd this one is simple
: gattaca is more frightening
. most of the concepts ofthe this movei are based onthe recent discoveries in genetic engineering
. using tihs premise
, writter
/ director
andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense
and thrills
. unfortunately
, due to a lack of advertising
, i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office
. since seeing the film
, i have been asking peple if they have seen gattaca
. lately
,
however
, i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca
. most people don
' t even realize thgat it is a film
. despite this fact
, i surely hope thta the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends baout it
. niccol
' s film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter
, better produced
,
and more realistic
. gattaca begins in the 21st century
. procreating is now done in a petri dish
,
and genetic engineering is the normal way of doing it
. natural child birth is considered old
- fashioned
. we are introduced tothe jerome morrow
( ethan hawke
)
, an employee of the gattaca space program
. one of the directors of the program has been murdered
,
and the main suspect is one vincent freeman
. the only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman
. vincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love
.
however
, after his birth
,
and through several genetic tests
, doctors tell his parents that he will have a 99
% chance of a weak heart
, as well as poor eye sight adn a short life span
. as a result
, both parents decide to bring their next baby into the world via genetics
. anton
( loren dean
) is produced without flaws
,
and the competition vetween brothers spawns
. vincent has a dream to fly a solo
- flight around tghe titan
, the 14th moon of saturn
,
but because of his condition
, gattaca
,
and society inwhich genaral
, forces him to do menial labor around the company
. labeled an
" infront
- valid
,
" vincent
' s dream seems impossible
, until he meets a black
- market dna specialist
, german
( tony shalhoub
)
. german introduces him to a
" valid
" who has been paralized from the waste down due to an automobile accident
. jerome morrow
( jude law
) agrees to give vincent all tyhe propper identification tools
( urine
, blood
, skin
and hair samples
, etc
.
) that he will need to get past gattaca
' s tight security
. in exchange
, vincent will provide jerome wih the rent money anbd friendship
. after the murder
,
however
, his dreasm are put at risk due to one of vincent
' s eyelashes left at the scene of the crime
. irene cassini
( uma thurman
) is a genetically flawed
" valid
" working for gattaca
,
and she begins tothe fall in love wih vincent
/ jerome
. gattaca is one of the best science fiction films i have seen in a long time
. only two other intelligent sceince fiction films haev come out in the past two years
( contact adn thge arival
)
and gattaca iwll rank among them
. unfortunately
, whenever noe intelligent film comes out against spacial effects
- laden films
, it normally gets buried
. the second best thing about gattaca is the production design by jan roelfs
. the orange glow of gattaca
' s scenes are impressive
, bu the sets deserve most of the credit
. the sets are very well done
, creating a futuristic sense
,
but nto too futuristic as tothe alienate viewers
. as we look at the designs
, we realize that these buildings aren
' t too far into the future
. this brings the plot even more credibility as genetic engeneering becomes more possible by every passing day
. the best thing
,
however
, is the plot
. the story isnt more than your average sci
- fi
/ thriller
. at its heart
, it develops a theme which is never overpowering
but is always present
. perhaps niccol is warning our race about the changes genetic tampering could bring
. would our society become a bunch of soulless zombies
? maybe human nature is a result ofthe mankind
' s flaws
. if we get rid ofthe flaws
, do we get rid of dreams as well
? niccol
' s intelligent script h
andles all these questions extremely well
,
and the result is an incredibly smart thriller set against a dramatic story
, or vice versa
. the power of the actors brings a lot of credibility to flat characters
. while flat may sound like a poor job on niccol
' s part
, it actually enhances the meaning behind the story
. ethan hawke has developed into a h
andsome adult actor
, giving his best performance of his lifetime so far
. his curiosity
and motivation pushes his character past all the discouraging remarks from his parents
and
" valid
" peers
. uma thurman is
.
.
. well
, uma thurman
. her character isnt slightly underdeveloped
,
but the story isn
' t about her
.
however
, thurman gives a lot of depth to the flat character
. jude law gives the most complex performance of the film with the most disturbingly realistic character
. he provides several nice touches
, annd his final scene is a very touching
and heartwrenching one
. loren dean gives a nice performence in his well
- developed character
. dean is allso responsible for some of the most suspenseful scenes inaddition tghe movie
. alan arkin portrays one of the detectives with a little less more excitement than with his psychiatrist in grosse pointe blank
. still
, he does a good job
. gore vidal
and x
ander berkeley both provide some very good supporting roles
,
and berkeley also gives a heartfelt discussion towards the end of the film
. gattaca is rated pg
- 13 for brief violent images
, language
, some sexuality
,
and nudity
. despite the somber
and desolate mood of the entire film
, i wasn
' t exactly prepared for the ending which left me feeling empty
. it turned me off slightly
,
but
then i realized that everything turned out the way it should have
. if this had been a typical hollywood film
, it would have ended much differently
.
however
, with all the mindless science fiction films out there
, it is nice to have a film which doesn
' t talk down to its audience
( i especially like the ironic title
and how it consists of thge four letters which mkae up the genetic coding
: g
, t
, c
,
and a
)
. instead
, it provides some much needed entertainment which gives us science fiction fanatics just what we want
: a science fiction film with morals behind it
. whatever hapened to giving the audience a lesson hwile entertaining
? hopefully more writers
and directors will leran from gattaca
.
.
.
and hopefully audiences will too
. p
. s
. personal note to p
. j
. gladnick
: how dare you call this film the worst film of the eyar
. i can
' t even begin to image what film you do like
. that frightens me beyond anything
.
