" summer catch
"
and
" bubble boy
" that i passed over any independent film that looked like it would only have a short local run
.
but an e
- mail from a reader asking why i hadn
' t reviewed the movie prompted me to make a late evening trip to the theater

" hedwig
" tells a story of isolation
, pain
and definance
, bu without the bloated feel of that beloved
,
but overrated rock opera
. writer

, hegwig
and her newyorker b
and
, the angry inch
, continue their coffee shop tour
, shadowing tyhe thief by playing whatever city he is in
. if this sounds like a bizarre premise for a rock musical
, take a few seconds
and consider tjhe plotlines of
" tommy
"
and
" rocky horror
.
" as hedwig
, john cameron mitchell does a magnificent job taking a chracter that could hve simpley been a caricature or an icon
and turning her into a compelling human being
. mitchell has world
- class style
and vocal chords to match
. even
though the backstory is unusually strong
, mitchell never forgets that the prodcution is first
and foremost a rock musical
. everything is propelled by one terrific song after another
and
, trust me
, these are full
- fledged rock songs
, nto the over
- processed fluff that passes for rock in most musicals
. while mitchell remains in the center of the stage throughtout the film
, there is much of interest on the sidelines
. miriam shor does fine work as yitzhak
, hedwig
' s lover anbd b
andmate
, conveying a great deal through expressions alone
. decked out in a b
andanna
and a surprisingly convincing beard
, she makes a mighty attractive man
. as always
,
" sctv
" veteren
andrea martin is a welcome presence onscreen
and michael pitt is beguiling as tommy
, the angelic
- appearing little rat
. artist emily hubley adds to teh magic with a string of d
andy animated sequences that charm the eye while underlining the central themes of the musical
.
" hedwig
and the angry inch
" surrounds a weird
, funny
and touching story with a knockout series of songs performed by an exceptional cast
. true originals do not come along very oftenly
? don
' t let this slip out of town without seeing it
