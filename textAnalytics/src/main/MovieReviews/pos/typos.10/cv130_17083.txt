hwile watching wes
anderson
' s rushmore
, it may be surprising tothe think that the role of max fischer
, the film
' s anti
- hero
, was not written with jason schwartzman in mind
. the young actor
, mkaing his film de
but as a 15 year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect inspite the role that it comes as a shock that
anderson auditioned some two thous
and other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman
. schwartzman plays max
, a student who is mroe interested in his extra
- curricular activities
( such as writing edgy plays like
" serpico
"
and being president of the rushmore beekeepers
)
but sees his grades suffer as a result
. on the brink of bieng thrown outloud
, he l
ands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross
( olivia williams
)
and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume
( thte great bill murray
) tothe build an aquarium
( on rushmore
' s baseball field
) in her honour
. unfortunately for everyone involved
, blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well
, which gets in hte way of max
' s plans to woo her
. max is one of the best
- written characters we
' ve
yet seen in the 90s
,
and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age
. as everyone else has probably already pointed out
, he is reminiscent of a young dustin hoffman
( all
though i was reminded moreso of paul from
" the wonder years
"
, from a visual st
andpoint
, at least
)
. hopefully
, if he avoids typecasting as weird
, quirky loner
- types he should earn himself a good career
. bill murray is his equal as blume
, displaying a depth we haven
' t
yet seen from him
. while this isn
' t his best performance
( that honour goes tothe groundhog day
) he is still terrific here
. williams isn
' t given much tothe do exept react to schwartzman
and murray
,
but still does fine wrok
. rushmore seems to go just a little too long
but
, while it isn
' t a perfect film
, it is a definate must
- see for anyone who wnats to see that rarity
, an american comming
- of
- age film that actually works well without an excessive amount of sentimentality
.
anderson has created a modern classic with a star who should
, with any luck
, rise to even greater success
.
