in october of 1997
, audiences were dazzled by the horror surprise hit i know what you did last summer
. the film went on to gross over 70 million dollars in thte u
. s
.
,
and even developed a cult following
, much like the previous year
' s 100 million dollar grossing scream
. when the trailer hit theaters in september attached to urban legend
, it looked liuke a wonderful follow
- up
. did it live uv to the first film
? the answer is noone
. jennifer love hewitt returns as julie james
, a survivor of the serial killer that attempted to kill her
and her friends a year before
. she has been so upset since the incident
. nightmares haunt her all over the place
, bu she has to move on
. she know attends college
,
and is best friends with a funny
, outgoing girl named karla
( br
andy
)
, who is trying to hook julie up with will benson
, played by newcomer matthew settle
. karla
' s boyfriend is tyrell
, hte funny
, outgoing type
, who is played by soul food
' s mekhi phifer
. freddie prinze jr
. also returns as ray
, julie
' s boyfriend from a year ago
. one morning
, julie
and karla are called up by a local radio station who are offering four tickets to the bahamas if they can correctly identify the capital of brazil
. of course
, they answer it correctly
,
and they are off to the bahamas
. julie wants ray to come
,
but he declines the offer
, so karla secretly invites will instead to help boost her plan of hooking him up with julie
. after they arrive at their hotel
, it is just them
and the staff on the isl
and
. it starts off as the weekend ofthe their dreams
. something just had to come to mess up the one care
- free weekend of julie
' s life
though
. ben willis
( muse watson
) is back
,
and he isn
' t letting anyone survive this time
. will ray come to the rescue before he can kill them off one by one
? jennifer love hewitt
and br
andy turn in respectable performances
. br
andy in particular was impressive
, considering this isnt her first feature film
. you could see that hte characters were horrified
,
and they would do anything possible to survive
. matthew settle
and freddie prinze jr
. are a completely different story
. let
' s start with settle
. matthew isnt completelyl fake in this film
. you could not believe a word coming out of his mouth
. you sould tell he was acting
,
and its reasons like him that this one isn
' t as good as the first oen
. he does do a good job towards the end
,
but taht doesn
' t clear up the scars he already left on the film
. freddie prinze jr
. is almost as bad as matthew settle wass
. he isnt almost completely unbelievable
,
and the majority of his lines are completely meaningless anbd out of place
. we don
' t see him as much as settle
, otherwise he could have done jsut as much damage as settle did
. mekhi phifer is alright as tyrell
,
but
yet again the dialogue is out of place
. the plot of i still know turns out to be a pretty good one at the end of the movie
. i like where the filmmakers went witht this second installment
,
but maybe if it occurred in the same town as the first one
, it would have been a bited better
. the cinematography
and setting of thier isl
and are simply wonderful
. there are a lot of very nice shots arround their hotel
. hte sound is pretty good
, bu still not as creepy as the first film
' s
. jennifer love hewitt
' s song
,
" how dont i deal
" is also played for about thirty seconds
. i still know what you did last summer is nothing compared to the first film
. the first film was very suspenseful
,
and it contained some very memorable scenes
. the last fifteen minutes of i still know whta you did last summer really picked up
,
and almost reached the same level as the first film
. before this part in the film
, there are many unnecessary deaths
and fake scares
. that is okay
though
, because the film is still very much fun
and there are a few suspenseful scenes
. i thiunk the reason this film wasn
' t as scary as tjhe original was because in the first one
, the killer terrorized the people involved in the incident
. he made them suffer fo what they did
. in thte second film
, ben willis jsut kills anyone he feels liuke
. he doesn
' t stick with ravy
and julie
, who were the ones he is actually after
. he had to go after karla
, will
, annd tyrell
. if the characters he stalked were in some relation to the incident that went on whn he was ran over by julie
, ray
, helen
, annd barry
, it could have been much better
,
and it would have made a lot more sense
. the bottom line
- nto a disappointment
,
but a third in the series would be out of h
and
.
