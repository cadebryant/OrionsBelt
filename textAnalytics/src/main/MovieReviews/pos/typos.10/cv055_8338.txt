i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theery
. thsi was
, of course
, a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby forthe me
and i never git a chance at something like this
. not only did i git to see an advance screening
, i was able to see an advance screening of a
* very good
* movie
. the very fast
- paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher
, a fast
- talking
, witty
, comical taxi driver in new york city
. gibson
' s peformance is terrific
,
and his charachter isnt similar tothe that of martin riggs iin the lethal weapon films
. gibson again teams up with richard donner
, as he did in the lethal weapon films anbd maverick
,
and this tiem around
, the combination works even better
. the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique
. try to imagine a toned
- downed version of travis bickle who
, this time around
, is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover
- ups
. if you can imagin that
,
then you
' ve basically got jerry fletcher
. in many ways
, i was surprised by tihs movie
. to beign with
, i was surprised at how good it was
. don
' t get me wrong
, it
' s not goign to be accepting any gold trophies next spring
,
but it was a veyr enjoyable movie
. secondly
, i was surprised at mel gibson
' s peformance
. he provded a fantastic performance
. the previews of htis film led me to believe it was an all
- out action flick
, which affter viewing
, it was almost the opposite in a certain sense
. gibson
' s character has an almost uncountable number of one
- liners
, hillarious situations
,
and his chracter isnt one that the audience tends to side with throughout thte film
. for instance
, jerry
' s apartment
(
and especially his security
) is memorable
.
and last
, i wass surprised at how good the plot is
. writer brian helgel
and has created a terrific story
,
and when watching this film
, you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher
' s far
- fetched
( or so they seem at first
) conspiracy theories are helgel
and
' s own opinions
. mel gibson isn
' t the only st
and
- out in the film
. julia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton
, the department of justice employee who can
' t seem to stay away from jerry fletcher
, who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories
. he also seems obsessed anbd in lveo with her
. bu whenever he approachs her with another one of his theories
, she shrugs him
and his beliefs off
, continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him
. jerry
, obviously determined to continually seek outloud the truth
, continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory
, which wiull be printed in his newsletter
( same title as the movie
)
.
al
though he only has five subscribers
, he puts a large amount of time
and effort into his work
, adn publishes his next edition
. very soon after he does so
, he is abducted
and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr
. jonas
( patrick stewart
)
. after barely escaping alive
, jerry is forced to turn tothe the only person he can trust
: alice sutton
. the remainder of the film is almost always fast
- pased
and full of acation
and suspense
, with jerry
' s life bieng constantly put into jeopardy
.
and more along the way
, the audience
(
and alice
) learn more anbd more about jerry
' s life
. many things are explained
thoughout this film
, both to the characters
and to the audience
. for instance
, the meaning of tyhe book
" hte catcher in the rye
"
and its ties to assassins
, teh reason lone gunmen have three names
( e
. g
. lee harvey oswald
and james earl ray
)
,
and the real truth behind the grateful dead
. make sure listen closely throughout the film
, as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above
. definitely
, when conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th
, make sure you are st
anding in line to see it
. i am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film
, especially if you are into an action
- thriller with witty dialogue anbd numerous suspenseful situations
.
and even if you aren
' t
, you should still like this film
.
