satirical films usually fall inot one of two categories
: 1
) long
- term satire where everything
, including the jokes
, is somehow related on a large scale
( i
. e
.
" dr
. strangelove
"
; 2
) situation satire in which the comedy
and themes are derived moment by moment
and scene by scene
( i
. e
.
" men in black
"
)
. what
' s unique about
" wag tjhe dog
" is that it doesn
' t necessarily fit either of these descriptions
, annd
yet is both at the same time
. the result is a clever comedy based on an original
, smart premise
, even if the focus does tend to w
ander a bit
. if there
' s anything that affects americans the most it
' s politics
and showbusiness
. in this age of information
and technology
, we
' ve been so conditioned by the media annd the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things
, it
' s gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it
. we need the media to bring us the most up
- to
- date news
,
but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thikning
. this film starts off well by quickly establishing theese ideas
,
and thne presents an interesting scenario
: if politics
, the media coverage of politics
,
and the entertainment industry are so closely realted
, couldn
' t someone with the power
and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all
? that
' s the idea conrad brean
( de niro
)
, a professional washington spin doctor
, comes up with in order tothe restore the president
' s good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the electon
. brean
, along with the president
' s top advisor
, winifred ames
( heche
)
, fly to california to meet up witht hot
- shot movie producer stanley motss
( hoffman
)
. they pitch him an idea to
" produce
" the image of a war with albania
( it
' s a country no one
' s heard of so they people wiull buy it
)
. soon the wheels are in motion
and the film
' s riffing satire comes into play
. we
' re inundated with thte hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation
, such as a folk singer
, visual
and sound effects technicians
,
and a modern style expert known as the fad king
( leary
)
. the initial atmosphere is rich wih numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv
, in the movies
, or in the news
. the characters
' dialogue is witty
and funny
,
al
though some of the actuall jokes
and gags seem rather sitcom
- esque
. for example
, one scene shows motss
and brean
' s production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee
. motss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry
, bu instead wound up with a dozen different dogs
. since it
' s all computer
- enhanced anyway
, she ends up cradling a bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later
. this demonstrates the film
' s ability to take a relatively ordinary situation
and make it smart
and funny just through the premise
.
but
then there
' s thte gags
and one
- liners thyat
,
al
though are humorous
, seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actress
' s name
, or
, whenever a problem emerges
, always responding with
,
" this is nothing
!
" by the timne the film makes it to the midpoint
, everthing that is going to happen in terms ofthe plot happens
. the first act is quickly paced
, while the second act contains most ofthe the jokes
and is the core of the film
. every ten mintues or so a newyorker problem crops up that motss
and brean must deal with
,
and it
' s always fascinating to see what they do anbd how they do it
. the screenplay provides good characterization
and actually deals with most of the problems head
- on in realsitic manners
.
however
, it does have a tendency to avoid things
and shift its focus from the election campaign
and false war smokescreen tothe something a bit off the subject
. as the third act rolls around tjhe satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations
and less so with the big picture
. what had started off as a brilliant
, somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public beigns to seem moreso like something thast would happen inspite a movie
. still
, the situation comedy is qtuie funny
, especially a montage showing tghe entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt
. willie schumann
- a war hero motss
and brean concocted
. truly great satire manages to create for an intertaining story that makes you laugh at the time
,
but think about afterwards adn
" wag the dog
" at least suceeds in this respect
.
however
, in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done
, namely by extending the running time
and filling in the plot holes
.
then again
, it
' s a valiant effort
.
