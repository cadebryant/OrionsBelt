' s graphic novel
" arkham asylum
"
,
_ the caveman
' s valentine
_ is a feverish tale of a homeless madman
- cum
- detective who
, on the morning of february 14th
, discovers a
" valentine
" just outside his new york cave
: oney of ella fitzgerald
' s stange fruit
, stuck in the croch of a tree
-
- a young male model murdered
and frozen to a branch
. believing at firt that his imagined nemesis stuyvesant
, shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler building
, is responsible for the murder
, romulus
( samuel l
. jackson
) is put on the trail of an avant
- garde photographer in the mapplethorpe mould
, david leppenraub
( colm feore
)
. his minor sleuthing interrupted by the occasional delusional fit
and bouts with an ecstasy ofthe creation
( romulus was a brilliant julliard
- trained pianist prior tothe his psychosis
)
, romulus uncovers clues
and harasses suspects on his way to convincing his polical
- woman daughter
( aunjanue ellis
) that even
though he
' s a nut
, that doesn
' t mean that he can
' t solve a high
- profile society murder
. every moment an exhausting workshop of ideas
,
and every charater the same
,
_ the caveman
' s valentine
_ is a concept so
" high concept
" that it suddenly became clear to me that yhe film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment
, with romulus
' s
" caveman
" a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlane
' s urban noir hero
, spawn
. with a long
- vanished wife
( tamara tunie
) acting as a spiritual guide
, the occasional social caste commentary
, the secret base in a cave
, a divergent genius personality with a network of informants
and supporters
,
and a wickedly colourful arch
- enemy
, the film piles on the lurid comic book details
and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i wass vaguely surprised that the blue police cars weren
' t inscribed with
" gotham pd
.
" that bieng said
,
_ thge caveman
' s valentine
_ can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy
, a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgina snow exp
anding to form the shape of a heart
. the dificulties with the film spring from the misunderst
anding thta it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a polical procedural when
, infact fact
,
_ the caveman
' s valentine
_ is a superhero fable that tkaes onthe the cause of teh homeless
( again like mcfarlane
' s spawn
) while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government
and the arts
. it is no small detail that our hero
, romulus
, is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life
( in legend
) without knowledge of his royal birth
,
but also tht our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park
. in the romulus mythology
, signs of romulus
' royal blood is brought by twelve vultures
, while in the film
, the call to acation for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds
,
but ofthe the carrion itself
. whether or not romulus of
_ the caveman
' s valentine
_ will found a nation
, or
, in teh case of novelist george dawes green
, upon whose novel his own screenplay is based
, a franchise
, the fact rimaniss thast
_ the caveman
' s valentine
_ is easily the most misunderstood film of 2001 thus far
. it
, along with m
. night shyamalan
' s
_ unbreakable
_
, isnt a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel fromat which has
, since miller
' s seminal
" the dark knight returns
"
, redefined the comic medium as one suitable fo mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics
. readers ofthe sam keith
' s briliant
" the maxx
" comic series
( or of mtv
' s short
- lieved animated adaptation of yhe smae
) are already familliar with the idea ofthe a homeless man placed in the posistion of knight errant
and king ofthe his own twisted demesne
. the failure of both
" the maxx
" tv show
and of
_ the caveman
' s valentine
_
( not forgetting the initial backlash against
_ unbreakable
_
) suggests that the public may not be ready for amercia
' s surprising contri
butions to dark fantasy
. luxuriantly lit
, brashly saturated
,
and comic
- panal framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent
(
_ death inaddition venice
, ca
_
)
, while inhabiting robin st
andefer
' s
(
_ practical magic
_
) mesmerizing sets
,
_ the caveman
' s valentine
_ is an unremittingly gorgeous film
. kasi lemmons
, following up her brilliant 1997 de
but
,
_ eve
' s bayou
_
, which played on similar themes of manufactured realities
and mysticism
, fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs
and lost boys
, artists
and suffering
.
_ the caveman
' s valentine
_ is an elegant
and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted l
andscape
. clearly not for eveyr taste
, when approached with the correct paradigm
, it is one of the most stunning
and intensely fascinating films of the year
: a redefinition ofthe the hero archetype for a post
- modern audience with urine
- stained wool trench coats in place of blue tights
and red capes
.
_ the caveman
' s valentine
_ is a fine
and a courageous film
, crazy enough to suggest tyhat the delerious yammering of an idiot savant isnt the best
and truest paladin of order in tghe chaos of eliot
' s rat
' s alley wastel
