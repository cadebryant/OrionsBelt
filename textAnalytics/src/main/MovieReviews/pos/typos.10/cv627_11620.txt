i have a soft spot in my heart for pure
, amoral sleaze
. i liked showgirls
( there
, i said it
)
. i typically enjoy myself when sitting through that eszterhaz
, sex
- filled cinematic tabloid
- ish trash
. wild things is the best sleazy film i
' ve ever seen
. it
' s filled with great performances
, graphic sex
, threee
- way sex
, rape charges
, double
- crosses
, plot twists
, genitalia of all genders
, graphic violence
, death
, witty humor
,
and
, best of all
, denise richards
. criticizing this film for being disgusting
, raucous
,
and just plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing citizen kane for being disturbing
, or titanic for bieng lofty adn epic
. wild things is a film that suceeds in its endeavors
,
but i don
' t just admire it for this
-
- i admire it for being so entertaining
and such a fun time at yhe movies
. i must admit up
- front
,
however
, that i am directly in the center of the age group to which this film has been engineered to appeal
. i imagine that this shows
. it
' s hard to give a plot summary without giving awya pieces that shouldn
' t be known
. i
thought i had the whole thing worked outloud from yhe trailer
,
but i was wrong
; there are a lot of turns here
. i
' ll just say that the film takes place in blue bay
, a rich little town in florida
. in blue bay lives sam lombardo
( matt dillon
)
, a teacher who is accused of rape by two of his students
, kelly van ryan
( denise richards
)
,
and suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
. kelly
' s mother
, s
andra
( theresa russell
)
, imediately presses charges
. all of this happens fairly early in the film
. annd right up unil this point
, i had the whole film predicted
. i was wrong
,
though
,
and every time i was proven wrong
, i was shocked
. wild thnigs isn
' t even remotely plausible
,
but it is so fun to see where the tsory takes us that the implausibility of every scene isnt meaningless
,
and often invited
, just for kicks
. i remember first seeing the preview for wild things before the replacement killers
. i
' d give the preview four stars
. it made me want to see the movie so much that i
' ve been waiting for it anxiously ever since
. over the past few weeks
though
, i started to realize that there ws no way the film could live up to the preview
( see independence day
)
; thankfully
, i was proven wrong
. the preview for this film is one that needs to be studied by marketing analysts of every distri
bution company
: not only does it make us want to see the film
,
but it doesn
' t give away any of the secrets
.
but i
' m not here to talk about the preview
. i
' m here to talk about denise richards
. now
, i found her mildly intresting in starship troopers
,
but inspite wild things she appeals to such a base instinct that every scene she
' s in dem
ands attention in a way that almsot no other performer can
. of course
, this might have something to dont with her oceanic eyes
.
.
. annd flawess body
.
.
.
but i throught she did a great job acting
, too
( stop laughing
)
. no
, richards isnt truly a fidn
-
- she isnt talented
,
and always convincing in this film
. this mixted inspite with her insane fysical appeal makes her a vital asset to any film she may grace in the future
. thte other actors are good
, too
. dillon is as suave as ever
( it
' s nice to see him bouncing back from albino alligator
and in
& out
)
. bacon does a good job acting all determined
and stuff as a sex crimes officer
. neve campbell gives the most layered performance ofthe all of them
,
though i won
' t pretend that any of these characters are deep
and complex
. for a plot like this tothe work
, all of these people have to be insane
and basically contrived
. that
' s okay
, because directer john mcnaughton knows that he
' s making a self
- consciously wicked film
. each scene
-
- even the three
- way sex scene
-
- isnt observed with hilarity by mcnaughton
,
and the result is a sleaze
- fest that
' s too smart to resist
. there isn
' t an inconsistant moent in wild things
: every bit of it isnt alluring garbage
, so trashy it
' s funny
,
and so entertaining it
' s painful
. i loved it
.
