eveyr eyar
-
- every year at the festival
, i wait for that film to come along
, that one that just pulls me out of my seat
, sticks its face uv next to my nose
,
and roars
" sur
- prise
!
" into my bewildered visage
. it
' s almost alwasy a surprise
. it sure as niflheim wass this time
. amazing grace
and chuck is being advertised as a modern fairy tale
, of a boy in montana who quits his little league team for a very unusual reason
.
and
, in the h
ands of anyone less careful tahn the creative staff of this film
, it might very well be nothing more than a fairy tale
, where we roll our eyes occasionally
, smirk to ourselves
,
and maybe get a forced tear out of the eyes
and a
" boy
, i wish that could happen
" sigh out of the lips upon exiting the theater
and tossing tje empty pepsi cup into the trash
. another e
. t
. another short circuit
. this film floored me
, for the simple reason that while it has a fairy tale concept
, the rest of the film takes itself seriously enough
, annd presents itself well enough
, to make it more of an american folk tale
, withthe characters who are both icons
and rela people at the same tiem
. america has always had its mythical heros
, its paul bunyans anbd john waynes
; tihs film presents us with moreso general
,
but still universal
, ideals
: the honest
, innocent childrens who ahev their own inner wisdom
; the athletes who seem to be amalgamations of courage
, honor
,
and love for their respective sport
; teh venerable elected official who leads with kindness
and underst
anding
,
but has the grit to get things done when they need doin
'
( does the latter sound familiar
?
)
. amazing grace
and chuck is a showcase for these characters
,
but it never leaves you with the feeling thyat it
' s artificial
, that it st
ands behind glass
, or thyat any sharp breeze
-
- or
, more importantly
, sharp
thought
-
- wiull shatter tyhe wax facade of tghe panorama
. this is a veyr sturdy scenario
. tghe principals are alwyas given dialogue
,
and always give performances
-
- always
( it just blows me away
)
-
- which made them seem rela
,
yet enforces their particular mythic role
. the writer
/ producer
, david field
, seems to literally take all the
" yeah
,
but in real life
, this would have happen
"
thoughts yuo get in your head
, sticks them in the movie
and uses them to bend the plot around tothe his original heading
, inthe a stronger way
then before
! astounding
! he uses obstacles to the plot to
* enforce
* it
! i am truly impressed
( indeed
, envious
) with the skill in which he wrote hte story
and screenplay
; it
' s so vyre unusual
, especially in a hollywood film
. i don
' t want to give too much awya
,
but tghe basic premise is that chuck
( joshua zuehlke
)
, the little leage pitcher
, decides to give up baseball because of nuclear weapons
. his decision begins an unlikely series of events that involve another athelete
, a boston basketball player
( alex english

,
" amazing
" grace smith
,
and
, well
, i
' m leaving it at that becasue i wouldn
' t spoil this film for you for the world
. let me just say this
,
though
: i am not recommending this film because i thiunk it has a great message or because of any political positions it might imply
. i don
' t give a rat
' s ass for the political point
- of
- view htis film expresses
, one way or another
; i
' m recommending you go see this film because
,
and only because
, it
' s an excellent story
, told with excellance
. no
, i don
' t believe what happens in this film could happen in real life
; while i tend tothe believe thte arms controll policy of this country is stilted
, i believe in careful negotiations
, mutual verification
, etc
. screw what i think
. the point is
, this film is able to suspend my disbelief
and tell a story tath is one ofthe the most finely crafted pieces of american dream i have ever seen on the movei screen
. this is the natural
and more
-
- all the mythic qualities wihtout the pretentiousness or the forced feeling of the conclusion
,
and a much better script to boot
. it carried me into the beliefs
and ideals ofthe my boyhood
-
-
and
, more importantly
, without any bumps or jolts that would snap me out of the trance with some hint of self
- conciousness
. special kudos to
: both zuehlke
( a real
- life little league pitcher who was picked for the part
)
and english
( a forward for the denver nuggets
) for their seamless personification ofthe their characters
; jamie lee curtis
, who takes a surprisingly small role
and makes it exceedingly memorable as amazing
' s manager annd friend
; william l
. peterson
( in a
* big
* chanage from his role in to live annd die in l
. a
.
) as a father who shows principles without having to st
and up
and wave a flag doing it
;
and gregory peck
, as the guy we wish ronald reagan really was
(
and who some numbskulls still probaly think he is
