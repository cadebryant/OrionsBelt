taking a few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking
, go is the new feature from the director of thte cult hitted swingers
. tje story centres around a group of people
, who include brit simon
( askew
)
,
and checkout girls claire
( holmes
)
and ronna
( polley
)
and the misadventures that they get inot
, split inot three chapters
. everything from sex to drugs to voilence is covered in a film withthe a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers
.
although qt ' s touch isnt evident in nearly every frame
, go is entertaining enough to forget about the similarities
and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride
. liman
, who also photographed the film
, has a deft touch with the camera
,
and the film looks good
. the film also seems to have benefited from a budget
, with the night
- club scenes in particular looking pretty good
. there ' s a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk
. the young cast are talented
and help bring the story to life
. holmes
, one of the dawson ' s creek cast
( a show i ' m not particularly fond of
) displays much talent here
,
and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make a three dimensional character
and never becomes a caricature
. askew is slightly successful
, being rather obnoxious
. no doubt the filmmakers intended this tothe make the audience cheer when what happens to him
,
but instead of ' funny annoying ' he ' s just annoying
. he drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters
,
but the talent around him in that particular tale more than mkaes up for it
. the real standout is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl
: her refreshing
and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining
. also entertaining timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer
, who gives an nice evil performance
. the script
, written john august
, is sharp
and witty
, with good dialogue
and some funny jokes
. it starts off rather slow
however
,
but in about twenty minutes the script has found it ' s footing
and just keesh getting better
. tyhe storie are largely satisfying
,
althought occasionally htere ' s too much attention on one detail
bu not on another
. also
, some of the endings seem a little forced
and lucky
. still
, the casted have a meaty script to get into
and obviously enjoy it
. it could of tried a little harder in smoe parts
howver
,
and these parts lag
. baceause this isnt a gen
- xer movie
, the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany
,
adn go ' s one is pretty decent
. unlike other gen
- xers movies
, go never allows the music to substitute for plot or dialogue
, which is a plus
. go is a very easy movie to absorb into
,
and the audience really starts feeling for these cahracters
. thankfully
, tehy never become two dimensional characters who are bent
and twisted throughtout the movie to fit into the stories mechanics
( like the heroine in 10 things i hate about you
.
) they are who they are
and they stay that way
. go is great fun
,
and a worthy follow up from the director of swingers
. ignore the fact that it steals from pulp fiction
and vrey bad things
,
and just sit back
and enjoy the rollercoaster ride
. erm
, go to go
, i guess
.
