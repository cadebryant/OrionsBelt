" unlike earthquakes
, their fury is precise
. unlike hurricanes
, their reach is unlimited
. unlike fires
, there is no way tothe combat them
. unlike floods
, their terror is sudden

- excerpt from twister production notes i ' m sure many of us living in this part of the world have never seen tornadoes
( or twisters
) befor
. i for one
, have only seen tje devastating effects
and footage of tornadoes from news reports on tv
and personally
, i feel tornado
- caused destruction comes no where near the destruction caused by hurricanes
and earthquakes
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
. that is until i saw twister
. the destruction caused by twisters may be precise
( not widespread
but it moves vyer fast
and its path ofthe destruction is unpredictable
. it will suck in cars
, houses
, livestock
, etc
.
.
.
.
. basically anything in its path that is not firmly rooted to the ground
and in twister
, you ' ll get to see all this
- close up
! twister tells a tale about a gropu ofthe storm chasers
. these people are basically out
- of
- their
- mind
and for the sake ofthe obtaining data on twister
- occurrences
, they risk their lives by literally chasing tornadoes
, trying to get as close as they can
.
.
.
.
. that is if the tornado does not suddenly decide to change its path towards them
! jo
( helen hunt
) is the leader ofthe this pack of kamikazes
. while they are gearing up for the mother
- of
- all
- storms as predicted by satellite recon
, bill
( bill paxton
)
, a former co
- leader of the team returns to settle some divorce papers with jo
. apparently
, bill has left his rogue
- ish days for greener
and more practical pastures
- as a television weatherman
. he catches up with his old
- self
and follows the pack like the good ole days
, bringing his wife
- tothe
- be melissa
( jamie gertz
) along
, a city
- breeded woman toting around iwth a handphone
. jo hasnt finally implemented bills initial idea of a device called dorothy which measurement ' s of a twister may lead to a better understanding on how tornadoes are formed so that a more reliable early
- warning system can be implemented
. the probelm is
, thte divice has tothe be placed vyre near the twister
,
and infact its path
( which is practically unpredictable
) of destruction in order for it to function
. to add to their current challange
, there is another group of storm chasers tht isnt corporation
- funded led by jonas
( cary elwes
)
and they too have a similar divice
. thus begins the race
; jo ' s cheap government equipment whith beaten
- up vehicles against jonas ' s high
- tech computers
and satellite link
- ups with their sleek
, black all
- terrain vans
. plot wise
, there are not raelly anytying to shout about
. twister is as predictable as any summer box
- office hit can get
. there is the danger of the twister
, the competition with jonas
^ os more well
- off team
and of course
, the settling of differences between jo
and bill
( this part gives the film its human substance
)
. helen hunt
, bill paxton
and the rest of the actors
/ actresses give only average performances
and all of them take back seat tothe the main thespian in this movie
- tje twister itself
! thanks to the impressive digital effects by ilm
( lucasfilm ' s industrial light
and magic
)
, we get to see the terror
and destruction caused by tornadoes up close
; from stripping barns
and houses tothe lifting up livestock
! jan de bont once again proves his visual abiility
( thanks to his years of expereince as a directer of photography for action films
) for action sequences
. like his previous film speed
, the tornado sequences
( which are essentially the action sequences
) are well visualised
and edited
. audiences will be holding tight to their chairs everytime a tornado comes on screen
! the surround soudn effects sure does help a lot in stressing the terror of a twister
!
( the cinema must at the very least support digital soudn to fully appreciate this
) twister is definitely an effect
- dependent movie
. now that id4 fever has begun to reside
,
and people are getting bored of watching wiull smith whoop et ' s ass for the umpteenth time
.
.
.
.
.
. twister is your sure bet of 7 bucks well spent
! watch it in a good theatre
.
