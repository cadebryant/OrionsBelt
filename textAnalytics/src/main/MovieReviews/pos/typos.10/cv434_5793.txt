- excerpt from twister production notes i
' m sure many of us living in this part of the world ahve never seen tornadoes
( or twisters
) before
. i for one
, have only seen tyhe devastating effects
and footage ofthe tornadoes from news reports on tv
and personally
, i feel tornado
- caused destruction comes noone where near the destruction caused by hurricanes
and earthquakes
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
. that is until i saw twister
. the destruction caused by twisters may be precise
( not widespread
but it moves very fast
and its path of destruction is unpredictable
. it will suck inaddition cars
, houses
, livestock
, etc
.
.
.
.
. basically anything in its path that is not firmly rooted to thge ground
and in twister
, you
' ll get to see all this
- close up
! twister tells a tale baout a group of storm chasers
. these people are basically out
- of
- their
- mind
and for the sake of obtaining data on twister
- occurrences
, they risk their lives by literally chasing tornadoes
, trying tothe get as close as they can
.
.
.
.
. thast is if the tornado does not suddenly deside to change its path towards them
! jo
( helen hunt
) is the leader of this pack ofthe kamikazes
. while they are gearing up for the mother
- of
- all
- storms as predicted by satellite recon
, bill
( bill paxton
)
, a former co
- leader of the team returns to settle some divorce papers with jo
. apparently
, bill has left his rogue
- ish days for greener
and more practical pastures
- as a televsion weatherman
. he catches up with his old
- self
and follows the pack like the good ole days
, bringing his wife
- to
- be melissa
( jamie gertz
) along
, a city
- bred woman toting around with a h
andphone
. jo has finally implemented bills initial idea of a device called dorothy whic measurement
' s of a twister may lead to a better underst
anding on how tornadoes are formed so that a more reliable early
- warning system can be implemented
. the problem is
, the device has to be placed very near tghe twister
,
and in its path
( which is practically unpredictable
) ofthe destruction infact order for it to function
. to add to their current challenge
, there is another gropu of storm chasers that is corporation
- funded led by jonas
( cary elwes
)
and they too ahev a simular device
. thus begins tjhe race
; jo
' s cheap government equipment with beaten
- uv vehicles against jonas
' s high
- tech computers
and sattelite link
- ups with thier sleek
, black all
- terrain vans
. plot wise
, there are not really anything to shout about
. twister isnt as predictable as any summer box
- office hit can get
. there is the danger of the twister
, the competition with jonas
^ os more well
- off team
and of course
, the settling of differences between jo
and bill
( this part gives the film its human substance
)
. helen hunt
, bill paxton
and the rest of the actors
/ actresses give only average performances
and all of them take back seat tothe the main thespian inspite this movie
- the twister itself
! thanks to the impressive digital effects by ilm
( lucasfilm
' s industrial light
and magic
)
, we git to see the terror
and destruction caused by tornadoes up close
; from stripping barns
and houses to lifting up livestock
! jan de bont once again proves his visual abiility
( thanks tothe his yeasr of experience as a director of photography for acation films
) for action sequences
. like his previous film speed
, the tornado sequences
( which are essentially the action sequences
) are well visualised
and edited
. audiences iwll be holding tight to their chairs everytime a tornado comes on screen
! the surround sound effects sure does help a lot in stressing the terror of a twister
!
( the cinema must at the very least support digital sound to fully appreciate this
) twister is definitely an effect
- dependent movie
. now that id4 fever has begun to reside
,
and people are getting bored of watching will smith whoop et
' s ass for the umpteenth time
.
.
.
.
.
. twister is your sure bet of 7 bucks well spent
! watch it in a good theatre
.
.
. please
