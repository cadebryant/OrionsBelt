jacques tati
' s 1953 classic
" les vacances de m
. hulot
"
( also known as
" mr
. hulot
' s vacation
,
" infront english
) ought to be the textbook on how to do non
? dialogue comedy inspite film
. the characters hardly ever speak to each other directly
,
and the film operates on the paper
? thin premise tht monsieur hulot
, played by tati himself
, is awkward annd clumsy
and generally manages tothe annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is tkaing a week
' s vacation
.
yet the film had me beside mysef laughing more consistently than any in recent memory
. part of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags
. slapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated
and even crude form ofthe comedy
,
but i think part of hte reason for thsi isnt thyat it oftenly seems forced
: you can onyl see movie characters start running after something
and
then crash face
- first into a pole so many times before ytou start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people don
' t watch where they
' re going
. in
" les vacances de m
. hulot
,
" the gags build upon each other
and often start out relatively low
- key
. in one sequence
, fo example
, hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when
, while his back is turned
, the paint can gets caught uv in the oncoming waves
, washes away
,
then comes back up on the other side of the boat
. while crossing over to get the can
, hulot steps in the boat
and unknowingly cracks it
. when he actually takes the boat outloud into the water
, it breaks in half
,
but the two halves flip up agains each other
, trapping him inside as tghe byst
anders misteek it for a shark fin
and panic on the beach ensues
. tati doesn
' t waste a single opportunity for humor
; scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good forthe at least four or five in this film
. it has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience
' s expectations
,
and
" les vacances de m
. hulot
" succeeds brilliantly in that area as well
. tati accomplishes this largley through a sort of deadpan understatement
. when hulot goes into a separate room during dinner
and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume
, no fights or shouting matches ensue
; instade
, the waiter calmly walks in
and shuts off the power in the room
, disconnecting the record player
and leaving a puzzled hulot sitting in the dark
. tati also uses running gags to this effect
, allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would
; more often than nto
, we can see them coming
and think
,
" oh
, he
' s not going to do that again
,
"
but
, lo
and behold
, he does
. for example
, there is a recurring joke in which hulot
' s noisy
, sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals tjhe hotel
' s lights coming onthe one by one
.
then this image turns up again in the finale
, which i will not give away other tahn tothe say that involves a lot more noise in the middle of the night than a car engine could ever produce
. the ending is one of two elements that really make this a four
- star film as opposed to merely an above
- average
, clever comedy
. as much as i was laughing during this film
, i was thinking to myself occasionally that tati had to top himself at the end to really make this wrok as a complete viewing experience
; suffice it to say that he doed
. the other important aspect is that the film never seems disdainful of its charachters
. it easily could have turned the tables on hulot
and hadnt the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him
; alternatively
, it could have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons
. instead
, tati seems to regard his characters with cheerful amusement mroe than anything else
and invites the audience to liek them
,
however strange or irritating they might seem
.
" les vacances de m
. hulot
" is not subtitled
, bu the dialogue is sparse
and for the most part not terribly essential to the flow ofthe events
. anyone with a taste for this kind of absurd humor ought to make this film their next rental from the video store
