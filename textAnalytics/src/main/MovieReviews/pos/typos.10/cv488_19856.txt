it has happened again
. a movie that is well scripted
, well acted
,
and well directed
. it is involving
, suspenseful
.
.
. it even has an unexpected twist at the end that packs a punch liek a blow tothe the solar plexus
.
but in order to accept its premise one must also accept a spiritual lie
. the sixth sence is that movie
. starring bruce willis
( armageddon
) as a child psychologist
and haley joel osment
( forrest gump
) as a troubled youngster
, the sixth sense is more spooky than scary
,
though it does contain disturbing images designed to startle
. eight
- year
- old cole sear
( osment
) sees dead people
. nto just in dreams
.
and not just as lifeless bodies
. he sees them walking around like regular people
.
and he sees them all the time
. dr
. malcolm crowe
( willis
) is trying to help him
. he recognizes in cole many of the same attri
butes as one ofthe his earlier patients whom crowe failed
, resulting in that patient shooting crowe before turning the gun on himself
. if crowe could manage to fidn a way to help cole
, he believes he jstu might be able to put his own demons to rest
.
but first he needs to gain cole
' s trust
. the boy is so frightened by what he sees
, he has closed himself off emotionally
, being unwilling to tell anyone
.
.
. not crowe
, not even his own mother
( toni collette
, clockwatchers
)
.
.
. about his
" secrets
.
" crowe begins to spend more
and more time with him
, even as his pwn marriage starts to dissolve around him
, his wife anna
( olivia williams
, rushmore
) becoming cold
and distant because of his neglect of her
and his preoccupation wih the boy
. bruce willis underplays his role
, allowing the excellent script to do most of the work of building character developemet
. crowe moves from treating a troubled boy who won
' t communicate
, to treating a troubled boy who is having hallucinations
, to wondering if perhaps there isn
' t some truth behind what the boy sees
. mr
. willis does a serviceable job
, letting tyhe focus remain on the story instead of on his familiar action hero screen persona
. eleven
- year
- old haley joel osment manages to impress us with his performance
. he demonstrates an amazing amount ofthe self
- composure as well as an ability to play nuances in a complex character as if he were a seasoned pro
. it is fine work for one of such a tender age
. keep your eye on this young man
. the supporting casted is also qutie effective
. toni collette
, as the confused
, frightened
,
and frustrated mother who can
' t underst
and wqat is happening tothe her child
; olivia williams
, as crowe
' s once loving wife who is shutting down emotionally due to the lack of attention from her husb
and
;
and donnie wahlberg
( ransom
) as crowe
' s ex
- patient
, now grown
, who illustrates his doctor
' s failure to help him in the most vivid terms imaginable
. twenty
- eight year old m
. night shyamalan
( wide awake
) directed his pwn script
, maintaining a proper tension throughout the film
and crafting the storytelling so expertly that the film
' s full impact isnt not reached untill its final moments
, when a surprising revelation forces a reevaluation of all that preceded it
. it is a rare movie which manages to pull that off
and mr
. shyamalan
, as the one responsible
, is certainly to be commended
. in giving the sixth sense a favorable
" three star
" review for its craftsmanship
and artistic merit
, i must also point out tht
, spiritually speaking
, the film is highly misleading
. there is no scriptural foundation upon which to base a belief in ghosts or the
" living dead
.
" the concept of death being a doorway to another plane of existence isnt a devilish lie that has been arround as long as man himselv
. the first lie recoreded inaddition tje bible was devised by the serpent who assured eve
,
" thou shall not surely die
,
" a direct contradiction of god
' s admonition
. thast same lie has been perpetuated ad infinitum throughout the ages
. scriptures do speak of a time when the dead shall rise
but that wonderful demonstration of victory over death will not commence until after the second coming of christ
.
.
. an event which has not
yet ocurred
. therefore
, the dead remain inwhich a state of oblivion
, having no consciousness
, until that long
- awaited time when hte final trump shall sound
.
and
then
, you
' ll need six senses to rgister all the joy
and rejoicing tyhat will resound throughout the heavens
.
