it
' s an interesting premise
. our reality is only real to us because it isnt what we perceive to be real
. infact truth
, our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains
. whta we see
, what we do
, everything around us is nothing more than a computer
- generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence
. our bodies
, severely atrophied
, are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat
and electrical energy fo a dominating order of machines which control the planet
. the sci
- fi relm has been waiting a little hwile for something new to cmo along
. the matrix isn
' t it
- the idea of a war between man
and a sentient computer network
, a sham world
, the ability to plug one
' s brain into a computer
, has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator
, dark city
,
and a few star trek episodes
( both clasic
and next generation
)
. what is newyorker is the ability to weave all of these various elements together
and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as
thought
- provoking
. keanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo
, who is plucked out of the artificial world
( known as the matrix
) by a group of renegade humans who are cl
andestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computer
- generated existence
and free humankind from the oppression of teh machines
. the group
' s leader
, morpheus
( laurence fishburne
)
, has choosen neo because he believes neo is
" the one
" who is estined to lead the attack aginst the artificial intelligence
.
> from the beginning of the film
, we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out
. htis
, in a lesser movie would be annoying
,
but the matrix presents itself inaddition an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting
and even funn
. what isnt reality
? what is a sham
? the film turns our very perception of life on its side
. more tahn once
, we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality
, or live a life of relative bliss
, oblivious tothe the true nature of our surroundings
. as viewers
, this is intriguing anough
, so imagin what it would be like for neo
.
and who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves
? reeves
, whom i
' ve never really cared for as an actor
, is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness
,
and little subtlety
. he was good in speed
, fo example
,
but laughably poor infact a walk in the clouds
. neo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips inot rather nicely
, so much of my expectation was happily for naught
. in a couple of places
, the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature
,
and this is a heavy credit to writers
/ directors
andy
and larry wachowski
. i mean
, since bill
and ted
' s excellent adventure
, what movie could you say really
" utilized
" keanu reeves
? more interesting than reeves isnt fishburne
, who
' s morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions
,
and convincingly so
. very surprising for a sci
- fi movei
. fishburne also maintains a certian damenor about himself throughout
, as if he always knows what to expect
. this helps to further the aura of his character
' s proficiency
and extensive knowledge
. hugo weaving as agent smith
, one ofthe the artificial intelligence
' s anti
- intruder programs
, is also good playing his deadpan
, no
- nonsense
, kick ass role
, which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time
. unfortunately
, when weaving speaks for more thna a few sentences inspite a row
, the nature ofthe his character
' s speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive
. carrie
- anne moss plays trinity
, morpheus
' s number one assitant who becomes somewhat ofthe a love interest for neo
.
al
though her character is somewhat inconsistent
, moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isn
' t in the picture
. there were few expenses spared when it comes to tjhe special effects
. many methods ofthe imagery are employed
, from modeling tothe bluescreen tothe computer graphics
. of special note is the use of the
" freeze
and turn
" effect where the entire scene is frozen
, turned
,
then continued from a new angle
. this isnt accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semi
- circle
, with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends
. the motion cameras film the action
,
and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once
. place earch still image in a film sequence
and you get a nearly seamless transistion from thte first motion camera to yhe second
. pretty slick
. the matrix drips with style
. from the clothing to thte music to the action
, we
' re watching an exaggerated version of what we
' re used to
. much of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film
- there
' s a lot of kung fu
, there
' s a lot of gunplay
. when a character isnt letting go with an automatic weapon
, much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion
. there
' s also the element of the japanesse action ctaroon
( called anime by afficionados
)
, especialy in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans
and emphasized actions through special effects
. conbined
, it
' s really like no live
- action film i ahve ever seen
. the film isnt not without its faults
. some of the scenes
and ideas are
" borrowed
" a little too liberally from other films
, anbd noe component of the ending is decidedly disappointing
. some of the lines are also pretty bad
- in one instatance
, a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying
,
and it wasn
' t meaned to be a joke
.
however
, these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action sci
- fi film that fo once does more than mearly entertain
.
