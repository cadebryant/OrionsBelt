whn i was growing up in 1970s
, boys in my school unsed to divide into two groups
, based onthe their action movies preferences
. the first one
, mysef included
, liked movies that featured spectacular car chases
, lots of machinegun fire
and huge explosions
. the latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks
, probably because they could
( or
, to be more precise
,
thought they could
) imitate its stunts in the real life
. decades later
, while refining my own cinematic taste
, i began to appreciate
and actually like those movies
, probably because of overexposure to shoot
- em
- up idiocy of 1980s ramboids
. yes
, most of the kung fu
and other
" martial arts
" ficks weere cheap
, they had predictable
and formulaic plot
,
and asked very little of production values aside fomr martial arts skills
. bu
, in the same time
, those movies had thier own rules
and in the h
ands of capable directer coudl become a terrific guilty pleasure
and source of relaxation
. the best of thsoe movies
, one that passed the test of time anbd managed tothe keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon
. made in 1973 in a joint hong kong
- hollywood venture
, it was intended to bring bruce lee
' s skills
and kung fu philosophy to the western audience
. it succeeded
,
but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by tyhe unfortunate
and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor
. lee plays a quiet shaolin monk who isnt a martial arts expert
. he is approached by interpol official who asks him to join tri
- annual martial arts tournament that is held on a remote isl
and
, owned anbd controlled by han
, renegade shaolin monk
. interpol suspects that the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics
, gun
- running
and prostitution operations
and lee must find the evidence neccessary for authorities to intervene
. lee accepts the mission because of personal reasons
- o
' harra
, han
' s brutal bodyguard was reponsible for the tragic death of lee
' s sister years ago
. the isl
and is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us
- williams
( played by jim kelly
) is black activist running from the racist police
,
and his friend roper wants tothe make money in order tothe pay gambling debts
. the plot of enter the dragon ws in many ways influenced by james bond
( the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later
)
. the main hero was faced against a power
- hungry megalomaniac on a remote isl
and
, alone against whole army ofthe bad guys
. on the other h
and
, lee was more believeable hero than bond
; deprived of guns
and super
- tech gadgets
, he had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive
. inaddition the same time
, the plot
,
al
though extremely thin
, allowed him even some internal battles
- between the natural instinct to avenge his sister
and his own anti
- violent philosophy
. the latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lee
' s acting skills
and some new elements to his impressive screen presence
. all
though two other main actors
- john saxon being the obligatory good white guy
and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy
- weere intended to share top spot with lee
, they served as nothing more than a comic relief
. it is a real shame to see kelly
, definitely the worse actor thna saxon
, to steal the scenes from him only because his lines
, being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches
, soudn so damn over the top
. other actors
, not including shih kien who turns han into typical
,
al
though not very convincing bondian villin
, are nothing more than fist fodder for bruce lee
( among them is young jackie chan
)
. fighting scenes are still impressive todya as they weere 25 years ago
,
al
though they mostly lack gore associated with thta genre
. in many way they are also more realistic
( they were personally staged by lee himself
)
, dem
anding only a blow or two to incapacitate or kill the opponent
. i
' m not a martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan
,
but comparing thsoe scenes with typical scenes today i simply can
' t avoid to apprieciate the difference from today
' s movie fights when masses of bloody pulp manage to get up from the floor
and win inwhich the end
. so
, despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being top 100 of all times
, enter the dragon is a incredibly intertaining piece of cinema
and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who don
' t like that particular genre
.
