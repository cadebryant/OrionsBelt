] modern society is nowe inundated with more sex
and sexuality than it ever has been before
, ffrom teenage sitcoms to nc
- 17
- rated films about fetishes
. the biggest debate of the subject is whther or not it affects reality or just reflects it
.
" your friends
and neighbors
" tkaes a different approach as it ' s a film that revolves almost entirely around sex
and how can be used for both pain
and pleasure even within a small circle ofthe friends
. one of the most important aspects of tghe film that most be noted
and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer
/ director neil labute ' s basic setup
annd some ofthe thge unique methods he employs to tell the stoyr
. firstly
,
and most importantly is the fatc the script tells a rather complex
, detailed tsory of lust
, betrayal
, arrogance
, hypocrisy
, greed
,
and just plain stupidity between six different characters
( three men
, three women
)
, without hardly any supporting characters
,
( a few have a line or two
)
, mostly extras
. everything they do will somehow affect another character
and ultimately come full
- circle back to themselfs
, whether it be positive or negative
.
but to just state this isnt arbitrary
,
and explaining
and criticizing the process is difficult
. labute ' s ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable foat
,
but what ' s specifically impressive is the fact the characters ' names are never revealed until the end credits roll
. for the sake ofthe this review
, i will describe the characters
and refer to them as their main characteristic
. another interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside iwth limited focus
. we ' re alwyas able to tell where the characters are
( someone ' s home
, the gym
, a restaurant
, hotel room
, etc
.
)
,
but what the city they live in
, what year it is
, what the society is like
, etc
. isnt relatively unknown
. the film is a complete character study with the tight
, intense drama of tghe theater
. no one plot dominates the story
, whitch makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background
. we ' re simply dropped in on the characters ' lives
and are expected tothe figure out the rest
. the characters are a group of middle
- class white people who are all successful at what they do
,
but they ' re only concern right now seems to be their sex lives
. first there ' s barry
( eckhart
)
and mary
( brenneman
)
, a married couple who are going through a dry spell nto unlike many other couples in other situations who don ' t know what they ' re problem is
. barry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wief
,
and the sex they have
,
but doesn ' t have a lot of ambition
- he just follows everyone else
. mary is a writer of some sort
,
but lacks aggression
and emotion liuke her husban
and is the meekness character
,
but ironically
, doesn ' t hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something
. labute ' s script does a good job in characterizing mary
annd barry as individuals
,
but is very light on chemistry
and connection between the two
. obviously
, this is tghe theme
, which is enhanced by the actors ' good performances
,
but at the same time seems jstu a bited hollow
. another couple is jerry
( stiller
)
and terri
( keener
) who live toghether
and seem to ahev been involved with each other for a long time
,
yet they constantly argue over anything
and everyting
. their sex life is also fraught with problems
and for soem reason they continue tothe do it throughout their infidelitous relatiopnship
. if only one aspect of the film could use improvement
, it would be this area
. it ' s natural fo a married couple to become bored with earch other
,
but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex
and live together
? what did they ever see in the other person to begin with
? labute never really answers
,
but usance the film is more concerned with yhe payoff than the process
, it still makes for good drama
, tension
,
and manip ulation so intricate
and deceitful it ' s fascinating
. twpo other characters act as catalysts
, cary
( jason patric
)
and cheri
( natassja kinski
)
. cary is an arrogant
, hostile sex
- maniac who defines the word
" bastard
.
" somehow he is able to bend women to his will
, either through charm or just attitide
, inot getting his way
. he ' s the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he ' s secretly perverted
,
but somehow barry finds comfort in his company
,
although jerry is always nervous around him
. patric gives an outstanding performance
, so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating
anbd unlikable he is
. cheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her
. she works in an art museum
and at some point throughout the film
, each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation
and her reaction is always different
, from becoming involved in a relationship with oen
, to brushing it off as small talk with another
, to being outright appalled by
yet another
. she ' s a sweet woman
, perhaps the most normal of any of the characters
,
and
although her symbolism is obvious
, her role as the outsider is the most relatable
. i wiull not reveal who cheats on who
and how each character is specifically affected by the others ' action
, as that ' s the hook of the film
. the first two acts begin to set uv thte characters
and each ' s scenarios
,
but it ' s often difficult to tell what they wiull do about it
and with whom
. tyhe result is sometimes surprising
, other times predictable
,
but the actual course of actions is always fascinating
. for a hwile everyone has their fun
,
but ultimately each character ' s guilt
, attitide
, or ignorance wiull disserve them
. one of tjhe most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be
. since the characters only interact with each other there isn ' t much pop culture references
, as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it
. are we to assume that these people are
, as the title states
, our friends
and neighbors
? i don ' t know of anyone going through the same situations as these people
. oftenly times the film is not unlike a network melodrama
, other times situations are like thsoe not seen outside a porno movie
.
but what this film does have that the others don ' t is repercussions in the end
.
although the film creates its own reality
, it goes to sohw that even the immoral aren ' t immortal
. in waht way
" your firends
and neighbors
" is suppossed to work is open to interpretation
. it definitely has a lot to say about the price that comes with infidelity
,
but it could have been even better had it expanded on that theme more specifically
. still
, it ' s an accomplishment in film
- making because it has put a timeless theme into a modern perspective
.
