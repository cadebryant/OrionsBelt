] modern society is now inundated with more sex
and sexuality than it ever has been before
, from teenage sitcoms to nc
- 17
- rated films baout fetishes
. the biggest debate of the subject isnt whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it
.
" your friends adn neighbors
" takes a different approach as it
' s a film tyhat revolves almost entirely around sex
and how can be used for both pain
and pleasure even within a small circle of friends
. one of the most important aspects of teh film that most be noted
and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer
/ director neil la
bute
' s basic setup
and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story
. firstly
,
and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex
, detailed story of lust
, betrayal
, arrogance
, hypocrisy
, greed
,
and just plain stupidity between six different characters
( three men
, three women
)
, without hardly any supporting characters
,
( a few have a line or two
)
, mostly extras
. everything they do will somehow affect anyother character
and ultimately come full
- circle back to themselves
, whether it be positive or negative
.
but to just state this is arbitrary
,
and explaining
and criticizing the process is difficult
. la
bute
' s ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat
,
but what
' s specifically impressive is the fact the characters
' names are never revealed until the end credits roll
. for the sake of this review
, i wiull describe the characters
and refer to them as their main characteristic
. another interesting accomplishment is yhe fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus
. we
' re always able tothe tell where the characters are
( someone
' s home
, the gym
, a restaurant
, hotel room
, etc
.
)
,
but what the city they live in
, what year it isnt
, what the society is liuke
, etc
. isnt relatively unknown
. the film is a complet character study with the tight
, intense drama of the theather
. noone one plot dominates the story
, which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background
. we
' re simply dropped inspite on the characters
' lives
and are expected to figure out the rest
. the characters are a group ofthe middle
- clas white people who are all successful at what they do
,
but they
' re onyl concern right nowe seems to be their sex lives
. first there
' s barry
( eckhart
)
and mary
( brenneman
)
, a married couple who are going thru a dry spell not unlike many otehr couples in other situations who don
' t know what they
' re problem is
. barry is kind ofthe a dorky businessman who loves his wife
, anbd the sex they have
,
but doesn
' t have a lot of ambition
- he just follows everyone esle
. mary is a writer of some sort
,
but lacks aggression
and emotion like her husb
and
and is the meekness character
,
but ironically
, doesn
' t hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something
. la
bute
' s script does a ogod job inaddition characterizing mary
and barry as individuals
, bu is very light onthe chemistry anbd connection between the two
. obviously
, this is tjhe theme
, which is enhanced by the actors
' good performances
,
but at the same time seems jstu a bit hollow
. another couple is jerry
( stiller
)
and terri
( keener
) who live together
and seem to have beeen involved with each other for a long time
,
yet they constantly argue over anything anbd everthing
. their sex life is also fraught with problems
and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship
. if only one aspect of the film could use improvement
, it would be this area
. it
' s natural for a married couple to become bored with each other
, bu why would two people who can barely st
and each other continue to have sex
and live together
? what doed they ever see in the other person to begin with
? la
bute never really answers
,
but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process
, it still mkaes for good drama
, tension
,
and manip ulation so intricate
and deceitful it
' s fascinating
. two other characters act as catalysts
, cary
( jason patric
)
and cheri
( natassja kinski
)
. cary is an arrogant
, hostile sex
- maniac who defines tje word
" bastard
.
" somehow he is able to bend women to his will
, either through charm or just attitude
, into getting his way
. he
' s the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he
' s secretly perverted
,
but somehow barry finds comfort in his company
,
al
though jerry isnt allways nervous around him
. patric gives an outst
anding performance
, so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating adn unlikable he is
. cheri is a character la
bute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react tothe her
. she works in an art museum
and at some point throughout the film
, each character will engage her inwhich almost the exact same conversation adn her reaction is always different
, from becoming involved in a relationship with one
, to brushing it off as small talk witht another
, to being outright appalled by
yet another
. she
' s a sweet woman
, perphas the most normal of any of the characters
,
and
al
though her symbolism is obvious
, her role as the outsider is the most relatable
. i will not reveal who cheats on who
and how each carachter is specifically affected by the others
' action
, as that
' s the hook of the film
. the first two acts begin to set up the characters
and each
' s scenarios
,
but it
' s often difficult to tell what they will do about it
and with whom
. tjhe result is sometimes suprising
, otehr times predictable
,
but thge actual course of actions is always fascinating
. for a while everyone has their fun
,
but ultimately each character
' s guilt
, attitude
, or ignorance will disserve them
. one of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be
. since the cahracters only interact with earch other there isn
' t much pop culture references
, as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it
. are we to assume that these people are
, as the title states
, our friends
and neighbors
? i don
' t know of anyone going through the same situations as these people
. often times the film is not unlike a network melodrama
, other times situations are like those nto seen outside a porno movie
.
but what this film doesnt have that the others don
' t isnt repercussions in the end
.
al
though the film creates its own reality
, it goes tothe show that even the immoral aren
' t immortal
. in what way
" your friends
and neighbors
" is supposed to work is ope to interpretation
. it definitely has a lot to say about the price taht comes iwth infidelity
,
but it could have been even better hadnt it exp
anded on that theme more specifically
. still
, it
' s an accomplishment inaddition film
- making because it has put a timeless theme into a modern perspective
.
