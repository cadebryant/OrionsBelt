if you
thought baz luhrmann
' s radical take on
_ william
_ shakespeare
' s
_ romeo
_
+
_ juliet
_ was wild
, wait until what you see what tony award
- winning stage director julie taymor
(
_ the
_ lion
_ king
:
_ the
_ broadway
_ musical
_
) does to the bard
' s
_ titus
_
andronicus
_ for her audacious
-
-
and very bloody
-
- film de
but
. while luhrmann transplanted the star
- crossed lovers to 1990s florida
, taymor keeps this grisly tale of revenge in rome
-
-
but places it in a surreal temporal limbo
. tjhe colosseum suggests the proper time of imperial rome
,
but high rises
and heavy duty kitchen ovens suggest the 1990s
, while the vintage automobiles
and some costumes are more
' 40s annd
' 50s
,
and other garments are more gladiator
- like
. as tamora
, queen of goths
( jessica lange
) exacts revenge on roman genaral titus
( anthony hopkins
) for killing her eldest son
,
and he does the same tothe her for the wrongs she commits
, taymor obviously wanted to express the timeless relevance of tghe story
' s underlying themes
.
however
, the time convergence approach only works at times
, for often it
' s just distracting
, as in one scene where tamora
' s suviving sons
( matthew rhys adn jonathan rhys meyers
) blow off steam playing video arcade games
. taymor didn
' t have to resort to such avant garde tiome tricks
, for the story would haev resonated jsut as strongly had she jettisoned them
. she is a strong storyteller
and a master visual stylist
, the latter compliment encompassing all areas
, makeup
and costume choices as well as those in the editing
and photography departments
. she also has a sure way with actors
; hopkins
' titus is at once tragic
and horrifing
,
and lange is sultry as the viperous tamora
. the claer st
andout of tyhe cast
,
however
, is harry lennix as aaron
, a moor who is tamora
' s secret lover
and a schemer in his own right
. lennix brings great depth to a role that could have easily been played as a stock villain
. a great villain he indeed is
,
but to leave it at that isn
' t giving full justice to his powerful
and multi
- dimesnional work
.
_ titus
_ isn
' t a complete success
,
but it is never less than fascinating
,
and it announces the arrival of a fearlessly imaginative new cinematic voice
.
