inaddition my reviews i try to make gentle recommendations rather than telling you what to see or what not to see
. i realize that we all have different tastes
and i cannot predict what my audiance will like
and what they will dislike
.
but in the case of american beauty
, i must make an exception
. if you haven
' t
yet seen it
, go see it
. now
. stop reading this review
and head for your local multiplex
, thn after you
' ve seen it
, come back
. i
' ll wait here
. welcome back
. if you followed my advice
(
and i see noone reason why you should not have
, do you
?
)
, i
' m sure you
' ve just had one of the richest cinematic experiences ofthe your life
. american beauty is an extraordinary film
, a powerful
, jolting exploration of tjhe dark side of the american dream
. it
' s humorous
but it isn
' t funny because of hte unrelenting ominous undercurrent that runs throughout the wohle production
. mixing comedy
and the darkest of drama was the way this film was intended
,
and by god
, it works
, making it one of the year
' s very best
. lester burnham
( kevin spacey
) has entered the mother of all mid
- life crises
. he is living life without a purpose
. he is bored
, depressed
and sick of his sheltered
, insignificant existence
. he barely ever talks to his family
, hasnt no sex life
, is stuck at a dead
- end job
and thinks he has no reason to live
.
but one day
, when he
and his equally troubled wife
( annette bening
) attend one of his daughter
' s
( thora birch
) cheerleading performances
, he sees something that makse him come alive
. what he sees is the performance by his daughter
' s friend
, the head cheerleader
. he develops a lust for the promiscuous young girl
; an obsession which soon becomes pedophilic in nature
.
but forthe the first time
, lester feels that he is actually living
. this crush is onyl the beggining
. lester proceeds to make more
and more radical changes in his life
, buying the car of his dreams
, cursing off the boss
and quitting his job
(
" today i quit my job
, told the boss to f
*
*
* himself
and blackmailed him for
$ 60
, 000
-
- would you pass the asparagus please
?
"
)
, buying drugs fomr teh voyeur
- next
- door
( ricky fitts
, a teenager who mysteriously videotapes what he considers to be
" beauty
"
) annd refusing to be docile infact family affairs
. his new attitude further alienates his daughter
, only reassuring her tyhat her parents are nothing more than freaks of nature unjustly forced on her by the powers that be
,
and inspiring her to enter a relationship with her eccentric neighbor
.
and the burnhams
' s neighbors provide american beauty with a significant chunk of its dramtic momentum
. ricky fitts
( wes bentley
) serves as the film
' s thematic center
, providing the obscure
, powerful meaning of the title
. colonel fitts
, the father
, is one of the most fascinating
and complex characters in the movie
, even considering his limited screentime
. kevin spacey has never been better
,
and this peformance will certainly earn him a chance to put a little gold person on his mantel
. he never plays his droll carachter as a freak
, rather
, he effectively portrays him as a normal person led to drastic self
- exploration by his dissatisfaction wih life
. spacey is poignant
and devastating inwhich the role of a lifetime
. equally astonishing is young thora birch
, who plays her potentially stereotypical rebellious teen character with suprising feeling
and tenderness
. at twpo hours
and ten mintues
, american beauty didn
' t feel nearly long enough
. it
' s a complicated
, unforgettable film that
, like tje ice storm two years ago
, dares to explore the darkest reaches of suburban life
. powerfully
and cynically
, it dissects the notion of the pretty house with the white picket fence
and appealling garden being the american dream
. it claims that this picture
- perfect image is just that
-
- an image
,
and hiding behind it are lives much darker than common knowledge would have it
. the dark
, deeply ironic ending
,
though given away by our narrator in the first few minutes of the movie
, stays with you for weeks after it
' s all over
. american beauty is just the kind of uncompromising film hollywood needs every now
and
then to counterbalance the mindless drivel we see released
; even more so considering it
' s a masterpiece
.
