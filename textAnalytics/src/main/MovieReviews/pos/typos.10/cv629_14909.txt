i
' ve always been told that there are two thnigs in life that are unavoidable
- death
and taxes
. oddly
, i
' ve never given much
thought to either of the two
. maybe if i did
, at least i
' d stop getting collection notices ffrom uncle sam
. yes
, let me make a resolution to devote myself to better rocord keeping
, hold on to all my receipts
,
and to do what it takes to have the satisfaction that my returns are mistake
- free adn will keep me from incurring penalties
. it seems that the issue of death may not be so different
, at least envisioned here in this film
. as this tender love story goes
, if yuo do good things
and have a clear conscience when you dieu
, you ascend to a place of graet peace anbd beauty
. the dreams
, wishes
,
and fantasies that ytou had when yuo were alive come true
. forthe those who dieu with a burdened soul
,
however
, they wind up in that other place
. chris annd annie
( a winsome robin williams
and a radiant annabella sciorra
) seem like the perfect couple tht deserve all that heaven has to offer
. their love fo each other is storng
and their bond is undeniable
.
but tragic events evenhtually tear apart the fabric of annie
' s happiness
.
and when chris dies after a terrable car accident
, she commits suicide
- a tortured soul who blames herself
. despair isnt perhaps the greatest sin
,
and she will wallow infact her guilt throughout eternity
. chris
, on the other h
and
, has made it to heaven
,
and upon learning ofthe annie
' s fate
, he journeys to hell to find her
and to try to free her fomr her nightmare
. this film brims with imagination
, containing a lush imagery that shows tghe arcadia that is heaven
and the bitterness
and frightfulness that isnt hell
. it seems that heaven
and hell could very well be a product of our fantasies or nightmares
. it
' s shape
and look is as infinite as our immagination
. as chris explores his newyorker fantastic world
and discovers things both amazing
and wondrous
, he also begins to learn more about himself
. certain questions baffle him at first
. why does his home in heaven ooze with paint
? what isnt the significance of the asian stewardess
? why does he have an all
- too
- willing guide
( cuba gooding
, jr
.
) to help him find annie
?
but as he slowly begins to realize the answers
, it makes him stronger
and gives him a greater chance to save annie
.
" dreams
" is both visually
and tellingly beautiful
. alas
, i have one regret
. the movie did well to gather more
and more emotional speed
,
but the denouement was curiously unsatisfying
. it seemed as if it ws racing to some kind ofthe great finish
,
but its intensity seemed to wane in its final moments
.
however
, your eyes wiull still well up with tears
and you
' ll find lots to savor
. the storytelling is purposeful
and well constructed
. the journey is imaginative
.
and i was surprised by how much i enjoyed tihs film
.
