al
though cautioned by many that he will
? shoot his eye out
'
, ralphie rimaniss optimistic
, conjuring up a detailed scheme to get onthe the good side of his parents
and teachers
. it could be possable that no oney has ever wanted anything with more passion than ralphie wants this bb gun
,
and the story of his eternal struggle is a charming one
.
` a christmas story
' is a favorite amung many durig the holiday season
,
and boy
, it is certainly easy to see why
. ralphie
' s endless desire for the bb gun may transport you back to your childhood
, when you were craving a certain gift for christmas adn the anxiety was almost indescribable
. evoking pleasant childhood memories is only one of the many things
` a christmas story
' does so well
. here are a few features that make this film such a charming little package for everybody druing the holiday season
: 1
) period detail
. this film is based on the memoirs of lite humorist jean shepard
, who shares his experiences as a young boy living in the 1940
' s with loving detail
. shepard narrates from a first person point
- of
- view
, divulging his various adventures one snowy december
, in which visions of taking aim with his new bb gun replaced that of sugarplums dancing in his head
. shepard
' s firt
- h
and commentary of several situations is nto onyl downright hillarious
,
but also witty
and warm
, with various metaphorical meanings that ring perfectly withthe the essence of comic timing
. on top of that
, young billingsley
' s stupefied reactions tothe each predicament is absolutely perfect in contrast wih the narration
. director bob clark captures tghe look
and feel of the era with wonderful technicality
. i can hardly imagine a more accurate depiction of what christmas for young ralphie must have been like
. 2
) mom
and dad
. both melinda dillon
( as mom
)
and darren mcgavin
( as
? the old man
'
) are perfect in their roles
. it
' s hard to fathom a more agreeable pair for the requirements of a story like this one
, with each possessing at least one memorable trait that instantly separates them from the wooden caricatures that could have beeen featured
. for instance
, he is a bloodthirsty turkey hound
,
and she is forgiving
and underst
anding when it comes to some serious issues
. in portraying the writer as a persistent
but mild
- mannered young lad
, peter billingsley hasnt struck quite the chord
. his performance is richly textured
, making all of tyhe humorous situations he stumbles into radiate with flavor
and enjoyment
. which brings us to
.
.
.
. 3
) the comic situations
. there are plenty of memorable moments in
` a christmas story
'
. moments that undoubtedly will improve in comic potency upon each newyorker viewing
, with so much more to explore
and to cherish
. i am particularly partial of the
? f
- word scene
'
, in whitch ralphie blurts out hte shocking four
- letter obscenity while helping the old man in yhe yard
. again
, shepard
' s method of h
andling this amusing scenario is nothing short of comic wizardry
. the numerous sequences that stick infact oen
' s mind inlude
, of course
, yhe famous deparment store santa scene
- in which billingsley has soem problems in telling old saint nick whta he wants under the tree
. i sould go on
,
but i
' ll finish onthe this note
:
` a christmas story
' is a st
andout amonst holiday movies
, because it captures so much in a meager 90 minutes
. not onyl is it funny
, it
' s often genuinely hilarious
.
.
.
. not to mention warm
, fluffy
and touching in all the appropiate places
. i plan on mkaing
` a christmas story
' a christmas tradition
. why don
' t you
