there was a lot riding on this movie
. everyone even moderately interested in the
" scream
" series was dying to know how it would end
. what would be teh
" final act
"
? this is the end of an era for them
, a movie whihc has kept them up nights searching for clues on the internet
, talking
and tossing around rumors with theri equally enthused buddies
,
and
, fo kids under 17
, those elaborite plots consisting of buying a ticket tothe one movie
and hopping into
" scream
" while narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are only a year or two older than themselves
. no need to worry
;
" scream 3
" is endlessly inventive
and entertaining
, a fine epilogue to the series that made kevin williamson a household name
, reinvented the horror genre
,
and continued in the self
- referential
, post
- modern tradition of quentin
and co
. so
, how does tjhe story go
? as opposed to what some fanatical internet sites woudl have you believe
, sidney prescott
( neve campbell
)
, now all
- grown
- up
and constantly dealing with her pass in the constantly tormented sector of her psyche
, is nto living in hollywood fulfilling her dream to become an actress
,
but rather inwhich upstate california
, living
, underst
andably
, alone in the confines of fences
and vast security systems
. she works at home as a crisis center affiliate over hte phone
.
but that
?
?
? s not where tyhe movei starts off
. instead
, in a tactic that reminded me of the somewhat similar
,
and conceptually horrifying
, sequence inwhich
" eye for an eye
"
( 1995
)
, cotton weary
( liev schreiber
)
, now a big star
, drives home to his girlfriend in traffic when the killer calls
, dem
ands the location of sidney
?
?
? s home
,
and
, when he doesn
?
?
? t git it
, threatens the life of cotton
?
?
? s girlfriend christine
,
and cotton can
?
?
? t do anything to stop him
. the rest of the sequence is particularly clever
, setting up a constant throughout the picture
: the killer has a high
- tech electronic voice
- changer that tops that of the first two
. not only does he sound unmistakably like talented voice
- over artist roger jackson
( ha
, ha
)
, he can now easily duplicate tjhe voices of the lead charactors
, including sidney
,
and the returned agle weathers
( courtney cox arquette
)
and dewey riley
( david arquette
)
. at the smae time
, stab 3
, the third film
- within
- a
- film based around the characters
and events ofthe woodsboro
and windsor college
, has tooked a less au
thentic approach this time around in return to woodsboro
; whereas the account of the frist two films was true
, the franchise within
" scream
" has now become totally fictional
. nevertheless
, we learn
, cotton made an appearance in the movie which is now in production
, as himself tothe be killed off in the first scene
. so
, it seems that the real killer is offing our heroes in the order in which tehy bite it in the movei
?
?
' either the actor portraying them
, or the real hting
. sometimes both
. clever
, indeed
.
but
, who goes enxt
? no one knows
. threee different scripts were penned
, we
?
?
? re told
, to keep the true finale off the internet
( a nod to the
" scream
" 2 fiasco a few years back
)
and no one knows for sure which one the killer read
. still
, all the while sidney stays concealed in her hmeo
, only visiting dad for the first half
- hour of tjhe film
, while also having horrifying visions of her mother
, which takes us bcak a bit to sidney
?
?
? s fear of becoming what her mother was
?
?
' or
, at least
, what her mother was secretly
. when sidney finally ventures out to hollywood as the murders become more prevalent
, she
?
?
? s chased onto the set of stab 3
, w
andering through
" woodsboro
,
" written
and directed as an odd
, surveill
, nightmare indeed
, this is one of
" scream 3
"
?
?
? s finest moments
. okay
, over the years
, i
?
?
? ll admited that i
?
?
? ve become quite the
" scream
" fan
. no
, i don
?
?
? t ahev the ghostface costume or the director
?
?
? s cut laserdisc
,
but i often find myself compelled to pop inthe thte dvd ofthe either member of tjhe preceding duo
,
and can get quite caught up in the dramatic element of these films
( yes
, i said
" dramatic element
"
)
, sometimes debating with famaly
and friends the possibilities
and endless theories that have become quintessentially affiliated with
" scream
"
. throughout the film
,
though
, i noticed a much more subtle approach than hte other two films
. granted that there
?
?
? s stabbin
- a
- plenty going on throughout
,
but there
?
?
? s considerably less blood
, less gore
. honestly
, i like this approach
. it
?
?
? s more classical
, more rebellious
, constantly demonstrating the capable direction of wes craven
. he knows when to hold back
and at yhe same time makes the movie ooze with energy
, illustrating the delicate poise flowing from his years of experience
. some critics ahev noted that
" scream 3
" seems to take itself more seriously tihs time
; maybe so
, or maybe screenwriter ehren kruger
( arlington road
)
, who took over after williamson had scheduling conflicts
, saw an opportunity for true irony
?
?
' maybe even a little bited of satire
?
?
' if the film worked in a few more clich
?
? s
. what puts a damper on this otherwise exceptional
and creative film
, i
?
?
? m afraid
, is yhe ending
, or
, rather
, the identity of the killer
. it does the job
, i guess
, accomplishes what it should
, bringing the three films full circle
,
but apon my first viewing it seemed rather dissatisfying becuase it appears a littel too contrived
, too arbitrary
; after a second viewing
, whlch i endeavored upon due to thsi recurring disapprobation
, the killer
?
?
? s identity still seems a little too r
andom
,
but his motivation cameback acrost more sound this time around
,
and the eventual conclusion was ultimately more satisfying
. all in all
,
" scream 3
" does not fall victim to the most lamented priciple of a trilogy
: it is not the worst of the films
. as a trilogy
,
" scream
" was a lot of funn
; refreshing
, humorous
, offbeat
. almost sad to see it go
.
but
then
, it does seem best to quit while yuo
?
?
? re ahead
,
and
" scream 3
" does a fine job of providing closure to its characters
. for now
,
" scream
" holds the title as the finest series of horror films tothe be committed tothe celluloid
. not too shabby
.
