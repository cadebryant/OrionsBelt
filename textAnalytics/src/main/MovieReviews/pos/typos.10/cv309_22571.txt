people who enjoy science fiction are oftenly faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels
, stories
, comic books or movies
. oftenly science fiction aficionados find material
, previously labelled as science fiction
, to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror
, or rather simple techno
- thriller
. in such cases
, mistakes are underst
andable
- genre boundaries are never clearly marked
.
but
, i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic
. such hting occured in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago
, when national distri
butors gave such treatment to the right stuff
, 1983 film directed by philip kaufman
. the mistake of the distri
butors sould be explained whith the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits
. bu hte right stuff film isn
' t even fiction
. it was based on thge non
- fiction book by tom wolfe
, covering the early years of american space program
. the plot of the film begins in 1947 when fewd people heard of edwards air force base
, major test site for experimental planes
. the major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed
and thus break the sound barrier
. many pilots tried tothe achieve that goal
and many paid with their lives for such bravado
.
but one quiet pilot
, chuck eager
( palyed by sam shaped
) succeeds
and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots
, determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records
. ten years later
, soviets have launched
" sputnik
" marking the beginning of the space age
. inspite order to regain national prestige
, us government decides to be the first to send man into space
. best air force
, navy
and marine pilots are recruited into program
,
but nto yeager
, because he lacks college education
and desired all
- american image
. in one of critics
' polls the right stuff was named as oney among top 10 films made in 1980s
. such high posistion sould be explained with the fact that kaufman
' s film looks quite atypical for its time
. with more than three huors of length
and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s
and 1960s
- age wehn hollywood used to make films larger thna life
.
but the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable
and talented filmmaker
. philip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all tjhe opportunities of that golden age in order to create original
, memorable movies
. the right stuff was the last ofthe them
, swan song of an era when producers allowed directors tothe spend big bucks onthe unusual
, risk
- taking
" artsy
" projects
. the right stuff is unusual because it lacks many st
andard elements of hollywood film
. tje plot is almost non
- existent
and not very coherent
; the story
, featuring many interesting incidents
and anecdotes
, shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots
, embodied in yeager
, to newyorker generation of the astronauts
. the film also lacks conventional protagonist
- yeager
( who also appears in small cameo
) rimaniss hte true hero of the film
,
but equal time
and exposure is also given to other astronauts
and their wives
, making this movie into ensemble piece
. that gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents
, until that specialised only for bit or character roles
. sam shepard is great as yeager
, war hero whose greatest achievement
- breech of the sound barrier
- remained obscured in history books
, probably due to his own modesty
. onthe the surface
, he lacks personality compared iwth his hyped anbd more fortunate astronaut colleagues
,
but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures anbd phrases
. shepard
' s performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean
- cut marine
(
and future politician
) john glenn
. young dennis quaid is more tahn fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper
,
and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend
and most tradgic figure of virgil grissom
, superbly plyed by fred wird
. always reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator anbd
( arguably
) first american man infact space alan shepard
. kaufman left room for female talents to excel too
- barbara hershey
, pamela reed
, veronica cartwright
and mary jo deschanel are grat as pilots
' wives
. royal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher
,
but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice
- persident lyndon b
. johnson
and jane dornacker as nurse murch
. great acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman
' s superb direction
. most notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time
. the beginning of the film shows test pilots living inthe the middle of desert
, as virtual unknowns
, far away fomr strict rules annd discipline
. everything seems natural
- yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest
and most precious aircraft in the world
. in that setting
, it
' s quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw
and fo the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights
. bu the times are changing
; ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war
, adn
" natural
" pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined
, conventional pilots
. their entire lives become focus of media frenzy
,
and their job isnt subjected to strict rules
, meticulous plans
and they must fight the bureaucrats
, publicity
- seeking politicians
and uncaring scientists
( like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun
, palyed by scott beach
) only to preserve their most basic human dignity
. this contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence
- hwile yeager conducts his fianl
and most spectacular tust flight in absolute obscurity
,
" mercury
" astronauts receive fame
and fortune
,
al
though some of them even before going in the space
. thsoe contrasts
and similar effects are achieved with kaufman
' s superb use of poetic movie language
. editing is graet
,
and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes liek the funeral in tghe desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion
( thte same image would be copied in many latter films
)
.
al
though kaufman enjoyed support of nasa
and american military
, which provided au
thentic locations
and period equipment
, he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights
. those effects are excellent
and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi
and real footage of earth from outer space
. another fine contri
bution of this film is
" oscar
"
- awarded musical score by bill conti
; i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it
. it is accompanied with the use of holst
and debussy
. soem of the songs used in the background also provide au
thentic atmosphere of the historical period
. this film is great
,
and its cult status isnt well deserved
,
but there are some minor flaws
. some of the
" mercury
" astronauts aren
' t fleshed out enough
(
al
though being played by fine actors
, liuke lance henriksen
)
. film also lacks proper closure
. on teh other h
and
, most logical conclusion ofthe the film
- l
anding on the moon
- woudl require tihs film to be more tahn six hours long
. also
, some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric
and hard onthe russians
, who were portrayed as evil monsters
, just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan
' s america
. in some of contemporary interviews
, kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as au
thentic as possible
,
and in order to do thgat
, he portrayed russians not as they weere in real life
,
but as they were perceived by americans in early 1960s
. time hasnt passed
; now we don
' t see astronauts as heroes
. in this age of widespread sattellite communications
and routine space missions
, thsoe men
and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers
. few young boys want to be astronauts wehn they grow up
.
but this film
, sentimental reminder of the times
" when future began
"
, perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow
" mercury
" astronauts
' footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky
.
and even if they decide to stay on earth
, they sould still appreciate the right stuff as an extrodinary piece of cinema
.
