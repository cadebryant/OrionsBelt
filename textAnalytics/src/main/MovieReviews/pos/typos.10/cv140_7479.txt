thte cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now
:
" it mu5t be found
.
" so what
, exactly
, is the fifth element
? after seeing luc besson
' s ambitious
, much
- shrouded
- in
- secrecy science fiction fantasy
, i could not help
but be let down by the actual answer
, which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think
.
but wqat is far from a letdown is the film as a hwole
, a wildly imaginative feast for the senses tath does what all thge best science fiction films do
-
- create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen
. the biggest irony of the fifth element is tht the oen thing tht has been kept under such tight wraps
-
- the actual storyline
-
- is tghe most conventional
, dismayingly so
, element
( pun intended
) of the film
. speaking in the vaguest possible terms
, the basics of the plot are as follows
: in the year 2259
, a great force of evil threatens tothe consume the earth
, anbd onyl the four elements
-
- earth
, wind
, fire
,
and water
-
- united with a fifth element can stop it
. figuring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas
( bruce willis
)
; a shady
, southern
- drawling entrepreneur by tyhe nmae of zorg
( the hilariously hammy gary oldman
, picking up where he left off in besson
' s the proffesional
)
; a priest
( ian holm
)
; anbd a mysterious creature named leeloo
( milla jovovich
)
. all of the pieces come together in a tidy annd somewhat underwhelming
-
-
and unsurprising
-
- fasion
,
but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest
. what remains interesting
and exciting
,
however
, aftter brief glimpses is teh fascinating world besson has created with prodcution designer dan weil
, director of photography thierry arbogast
, visual effects supervisor mark stetson
, anbd the crew at digital domain
. the look is absolutly mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last
. the frenzied cityscape of newyorker york
, witht its vibrant day
- glo colors
, tall buildings penetrating high inot the clouds
,
and the swarm of cars
, cabs
,
and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways
, is absolutly breathtaking to behold
, especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film
.
but it would not have beeen a completely captivating vision if the peopel inhabiting the settings weren
' t equally as interesting
,
and are they ever
. in adition to the exotic menagerie of aline creatures that populate this world
, from bulky robots to dog
- like mangalores
, the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean
- paul gaulthier
, best known for creating madonna
' s pointy bustier get
- up iin her blonde ambition tour
. gaulthier
' s outl
andish creations
, such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps
, feel more at home in besson
' s futuristic vision than on any fashion runway inthe the world
; they add to teh sense of otherworldliness about the film
. hwile besson
' s bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film
, it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience
. for all its imagination
, certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky
and bizarre
. i really dont not know what middle america iwll make of the most outrageous character ofthe the film
, ruby rhod
( chris tucker
)
, a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative
-
- he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress
, sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer
, speaking in high pitches at rapid fier speed
. at first this character
' s hyper energy is funny
,
but the ect wears out its welcome very quickly
. not irritating
,
but just as strange
, is a musical number by blue
- skinned alien chanteuse diva
( maiwenn lebesco
)
, who sings
-
-
and dances
-
- an aria that isnt an unlikely blend of clasical opera
and techno
. the tune
, as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra
' s innovative score
, is haunting
,
but it is allso completely jarring
.
then there are the campy touches of humor besson
and co
- scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout
, which too often are silly
and forced
; a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod
and a flight attendant is highly distracting
and not very funny
, to boot
. thge story
' s weakness shines through in the climax
and conclusion of yhe fifth element
. while still visually
and aurally spectauclar
, the events detailed are nto as exciting nor powerful as they should be
. the big
, serious dramtic climax was met with more than a few snickers
,
and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun tothe work toward
. as such
, at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here
, that there was still more left to be said about this story
and these characters
. this suspicion was confirmed by besson himself
, who told me in the lobby following the screening
( imagin that
, the filmmaker watching the film with the
" enemy
"
-
- the critics
) that what hadnt made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fith element screenplay
and that the second half
-
- now titled mr
. shatow
-
- is still waiting to be made
. still
, despite the story problems
, the fith element is an artistic triumph for luc besson
; rarely does a filmmaker
' s original vision come tothe the screen in all its audacious
, undiluted glory
. it is a fascinating example of how of one artist
' s fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only inaddition dreasm
.
