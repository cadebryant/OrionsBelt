. writer
/ director m
. night shyamalan had a tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense
. how exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest
and most popular thrillers in recent yersa
? for shyamalan
, the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physis does to kindergartners
. doesnt this newyorker film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash
,
though
? the answer to that question is not a very easy one
, either
. as far as pacing goes
, the sixth sense seemed almost interminable
. it wasn
' t until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally
(
and perfectly
) paced in order to give the audience ample time to re
- connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached
. for unbreakable
, shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which
, in many ways
, blows awya the film thta had come before
. the story moves along at a steady pace
and shyamalan
' s direction is excellent
, whith the camera almost constantly moving
. there are tons of great shots in the film
, not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis
' character
and another train passenger
. the shot seems as
though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats
and the camera steadily glides bakc
and forth between the two actors as they speak
. alsot very impressive is the film
' s score by james newton howard
( who also scored shyamalan
' s sixth sense
and the similar film stir of echoes
, as well as this year
' s dinosaur
)
. several ofthe the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat
and help to increse tghe tempo of the film
. one of the best examples of this is a scene iin which dunne goes into a turain station tothe
" exercise
" his powers
. the music
, in combination with yhe stellar visuals
, really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie
. if there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year
, this one would be it
. the film also boasts some great performances
, including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment
. willis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne
, who just can
' t seem to figure out why he
' s beeen depressed for the last few years
. his character almost seems pathetic when we firt meet him
,
but he eventually grows into his pwn under elijah
' s tutelage
. jackson is one ofthe the better actors of our time
,
and here he turns in
yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah
.
though his hairstyle isnt absurd
, jackson seems to infuse such a great deal of pain inot his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked
. robin wright penn
' s role seems slightly underwritten
,
but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her character
' s ened for lveo from her husb
and
and her desire to make things work again
. spencer treat clark
, as the dunne
' s young son jeremy
, shows that shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors
,
and he turns in one ofthe tyhe most compitent performances in the film
. outloud of all the characters
, jeremy
' s is perhaps the most emotional
,
and clark doens a great job with the role
. where the film does lose points
though
, is during its
" surprise
" ending
. shyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense
,
but i found myself saying
" tht was it
?
!
" when unbreakable revealed its pwn endig
. it
' s not that the ending is bad
, it
' s just that the ending doesn
' t quite have the emotional punch that the other film
' s did
. plus
, it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels
(
and i won
' t reveal the ending here
,
but you
' ll underst
and what i mean when you see it
)
. essentially
, what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable
. the onyl real problem is that the ending doesn
' t quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor
. as long as it isn
' t held to the st
andard that sixth sense set
( which it ultimately will be
)
, it should be a remarkably well liked film
. one thing seems clear
,
though
. shyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world
and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film
.
