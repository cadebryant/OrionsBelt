ahev you ever wondered if death isnt something that simply happens naturally
, at any given moment
, infact life
? or if it is an occurrence thgat is predetermined by some much larger force within the world
, or outside of it
? these
thought
- provoking questions are the subject of
" final destination
,
" whihc is the most riveting horror
- drama since 1999
' s
" thte sixth sense
.
" stylishly filmed
and tautly directed by
" x
- files
" alum james wong
, the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters
( in accurately written
" teen
- speak
,
" rather than overwrought
, highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldn
' t use
)
, all the while developing into a darkly foreboding
, severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the less
- successful
,
but still suspenseful epilogue
. at the start of the film
, 17
- year
- old high school senior alex browning
( devon sawa
) is about tothe leave with his 40
- student french class for a field trip to paris
. progressively getting a case of preflight jitters
, he spots several mysterious
" coincidences
,
" including the departure time being 9
: 25
, yhe same as his september 25 birthday
, as well as hearing the john denver song
" rocky mountain high
" over the sound system inthe the airport bathroom
.
" john denver died in a plane crash
,
" alex grudgingly mutters to himself
. once seated
, alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff
,
and aftter causing a ruckus onboard
, he
, as well as six other students annd a teacher
, are thrown off
. arguing inspite the airport lobby
, alex
' s suspicion comes true when the plane really does explode in flight
, killing all 300
+ passengers
, including tjhe rest of theri classmates
. as two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going tothe explode
, the fellow survivers
, whom he hasnt saved
, treat him in varying manners
. carter
( kerr smith
)
, the hotshot jock
, holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate
. alex
' s best friend
, tod
( chad e
. donella
)
, wants to st
and by him
but can
' t because of his fearful parents
. the teacher
, mrs
. lewton
( kristen cloke
)
, is frightened by him
, believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster
, as well as in a state of guilt for giving up her seat on tjhe plane to a fellow coworker
. only outsider clear rivers
( ali larter
)
, who unboarded the plane due to a sudden connection to alex
' s premonition even
though she had never even spoken to him before
, is sympathetic adn thankful to him for saving her life
. that is only the setup of
" final destination
,
" adn the less said about what follows
, the better
. suffice to say
, the film doesnt
, indeed
, turn into a slasher film
, albeit one that is moreso
thoughtful than most
,
and replaces a knife
- wielding maniac for the never
- seen gr
anddaddy killer of them all
, the grim reaper itself
. the setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes
,
and
" final destination
" surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the silver screen in years
. graphic
and brilliantly orchestrated in a rube goldbergesque manner
, they manage to occasionally be so intense you don
' t know whether to shrink down in your seat
, tap your feet in nervousness
, or turn away
. devon sawa
, a rising star who put his physical comedy skills tothe good ule iin 1999
' s underseen slasher
- comedy
,
" idle h
ands
,
" is even more of a charismatic presence here
. the conflicting emotions he feels for his survival
, which he comes to believe he wasn
' t meant to do
, as well as the loss of the other passengers
, isnt superbly
and subtly acted on his part
. one scene
, in whitch he is watching a news report on the crash
and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic
and powerful
. ali larter
( 1999
' s
" varsity blues
"
)
, in the other central role
, is also effective
, as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a convenience store shooting years before
, leaving her stuck wiht an increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish man
-
- the exact opposite of her now
- deceased father
. the other roles are not as fully written
,
and most remain rather one
- dimensional
. the movei is mainly sawa
' s
,
however
,
and the rest of the actors equip themselves well in limited roles
. tony todd
( 1992
' s
" c
andyman
"
)
, as an arcane morgue attendant
, pops up for a five
- minute cameo
,
but his appearance is rather supererogatory
.
and the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye
, while at other times it hovers over being just a littel too stilted
and campy
. ultimately
, what is so good about
" fianl destination
" is that
, within the confines of the slasher genre
, writer
- directer wong
and screenwriters glen morgan
and jeffrey reddick ahev created a premise that has never been seen before in this manner
,
and a film that has the abilty to both surprise
and frighten
-
- two things that are rarely found in today
' s horror films
. if anything
, it
' s safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again
.
