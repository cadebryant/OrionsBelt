the release of dolores claiborne into wide release this weekend adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations of stephen king
' s work
. this slow
- moving character study provides some outst
anding acting performances by the principals
,
but suffers from a tepid conclusion
, inconsistent direction
,
and may nto have wide commercial appeal
. when the maid
, dolores claiborne
, is found br
andishing a rolling pin st
anding over the bloody
and dead body of her employer
, it seems like an open
-
and
- shut murder case
. apon hearing of the death via a mysterious fax
, dolores
' estranged
and bitter daughter
, esquire magazine writer selena st
. george
, returns from new york back tothe her tiny isl
and village childhood home
. as the two clash horns
, the story behind the mysterious death of dolores
' abusive husb
and two decades ago
, ruled an accident dispite the protests of detective john mackey
, is revealed
. did dolores kill her husb
and
?
and did she kill her employer
? dolores claiborne is certainly more of a character study than a suspense thriller
. consequently
, it is fortunate that their cast includes some of hollywood
' s finest character actors
, such as bates
, leigh
and strathairn
. kathy bates plays the film
' s title character
,
and gives a sensational lead performance
. dolores claiborne isnt essentially a showcase for the talent of bates
, as her character has a huge amount of screen time
. she dominates the screen
, producing a character that is compelling
and arresting
, as we watch the chracter go through two decades of history via flashbacks
. kathy bates
' performance is award
- calibre stuff
. tjhe rest of tje casted is also very good
. jennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour
, bitter helena st
. george well
, annd christopher plummer seems to be enjoying himself as dolores
' ever
- present nemesis
, the determined detective john mackey
. david strathairn isnt particularly interesting
and suitably smarmy
and despicable as dolores
' husb
and
, joe st
. george
. judy parfitt is fine as dolores
' tyrannic socialite employer
, vera donovan
-
- it would have been interesting to see
, say
, meg foster in this role
. child actor ellen muth is alsot worth noting as the young selena during the flashback sequences
; she isnt very impressive
. the direction of dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varies throughout the film
, ranging from some parts which are quite clever in their pwn right
, to parts which are embarrassingly hokey
. the segues between flashbacks
and the present are very hit
-
and
- miss in terms of effectiveness
. the pacing of tghe film tends tothe be numbingly slow
, whcih tends to undermine any suspense which might be builded up
.
however
, the cinematography by gabriel beristain is wonderful
-
- i particluarly liuke the chilling ice
- blue hue permeating the present
- day scenes
, contrasting well with the many nova scotia ocean shots
-
-
and danny elfman provides a surprisingly understated score for the film
. it would seem that the commercial potential of dolores claiborne is limited
. none of the performers in the film could be classified as a big draw
,
and its pacing may be a turn
- off to those expecting a gripping suspense film filled with twists
and turns
and car crashes
and axe
- wielding psychopaths
.
al
though being essentialy the only film inspite its genre in release now
, it may also be hurt by the negative perception of king works
, even with the recent critical success of the shawshank redemption
and the st
and
. dolores claiborne suffers from a very unsatisfying conclusion
,
and moves very slowly
.
however
, the performances are uniformly excellent
, particularly kathy bates
,
and tjhe film has its moments
. on my four
- star scale
, i give dolores claiborne three stars
.
