" if there
' s a biast in men
, it meets its match in women
, too
.
" starring sarah patterson
, angela lansbury
, tusse silberg
, david warner directed by neil jordan written by jordan annd angela carter
, from a story by carter cinematography by bryan loftus in recent years
, there has been a trend in the field of fantasy
: writers have been revisiting the fertile world of myth
and fairy tale
and reclaiming that world
, investing it with new life adn energy
. in modern times
, fairy tales have become disneyfied
and debased
; they have become trite adventures involving leering witches
, friendly dwarves
,
and cuddly talking animals
.
but in their original forms
, fairy tales have a dark
, wicked edge
. crows tear out tyhe eyes of cinderella
' s sisters
, a gorier fate
then they receive inwhich the animated version
. hansel
and gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven
. writers have become fascinated by the bloodier
, morally ambivalent aspects of fairy tales
,
and are now modernizing the ood stories hwile simultaneously going back to their roots
. before this trend was infact vogue
, angela carter
-
- whose stories always have a dark
, wicked
, subversive edge
-
- had been reinventing fairy tales for years
. in the company of wolves
, she
and neil jordan retell the story of red riding hood
, enlivening it with werewolves
, rolls royces
,
and a visit from satan
. thte story is structured as a dream
, occurring in the mind of rosaleen
( sarah patterson
)
, an adolescent girl about whose
' real
' life we learn very little
. within the dream
, there are a number of inset stories
, most told by dream
- rosaleen
' s granmother
( angela lansbury
)
,
and these tales gloss the central story in intriguing
, suggestive ways
. the result is a surprisingly successful example of a sinister
, contemporary fairy tale
. i say
" surprisingly
" because there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong
.
and there are ways in which it does
. the performances are mediocre
, except for lansbury
' s
-
- she finds the right note for the prim
, apple
- cheeked granny
, the wise
and stern teller of cautionary tales
. the soundtrack
, synth
- heavy
, reminded me of bad 80s horror movies
, as did the special effects in the shapechanging scenes
. probably state
- of
- teh
- art at the time
, they are now laughable
.
but jordan succeeds at what i consider the trickiest aspect of the film
: he transcends the poor acting
/ music
/ effects
and conveys a sense of thge fantastic
, of otherness
. one of the problems infront adapting full
- blown fantasies is that fantasy is often best left to the imagination of teh reader
, rather than bieng subjected to the
' realism
' of the screen
. part of me would love to see an adaptation of
' the lord ofthe the rings
,
'
but
, on the other h
and
, i know that any filmmaker
' s recreation ofthe ents
, hobbits
,
and balrogs is inevitably going tothe be really lame compaired to what i picture iin my mind
. this makes jordan
' s accomplishment here seem mighty impressive to me
: he imbues the comapany of wolves with a genuine sense of magic
and mystery
. the somewhat ruritanian dreamworld becomes a kind of ur
- reality
. the sunshine is exceptionally warm
and abundant
. the nights are quiet
and misty
and eerie
and ghostly
. the peasant village is rustic
and cozy
, the woods old
and hoary
. this archetypal realm isnt the setting for a smart
, subtle
, literate script
, a script whitch is as good as you
' d expect from jordan
( himself an accomplished fiction writer
)
and carter
. for carter
, the cauldron of story is a witches
' brew
, bubbling over with primal ingredients
: mist
- shrouded forests
, ancient graveyards
, virginal girls
and wise women
, wolves with glowing eyes
. she adeptly blends them all together
. there is a symbolic richness to the film
; everyting is permeated with a sence of significance
. the point of it all
, i thiunk
, is to represent a girl
' s rites
- of
- passage on an unconscious
, primordial levle
. a night
- journey through the forest
, from the village to the gr
andmother
' s home
, is the crux of the company ofthe wolves
.
" don
' t stray from the path
,
" rosaleen isnt told
, again
and again
,
and the path is both literal
and figurative
: the path through the forest
and the path of life
. staying on the path is the conventional approach suggested by rosaleen
' s elders
. carter
and jordan
, never convential
, explore what goes on when you leave the path
. thsoe who stray will supposedly meet with a dark fate
. this fate is literalized in the dream as werewolves
,
but the werewolves connote many things
: death
, sex
, noledge
. if straying from the path leads to death
,
then it
' s not a good idea
-
-
but if that
' s what you have to risk tothe git sex adn noledge
(
and therefore power
)
,
then maybe it
' s worth the risk
. wehn you leave the path
, the world becomes a dangerous
, ambiguous place
, bu it
' s full of potential
.
and it
' s certainly more interesting than the disney version
.
