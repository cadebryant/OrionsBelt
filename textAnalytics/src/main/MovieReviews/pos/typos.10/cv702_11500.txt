the characters in
" palmetto
" collectively sweat enough to fill lake erie
,
and it
' s just thte right way to capture the film
' s ripe atmosphere of sensuality
, tension
and even farce
. this humid florida
- set thriller nurtures a modestly absurd edginess that often winks at itself
, which is vrey much a good thing since the actors
and director are in on the joke
. as far as set
- up is concerned
, the movie is nothing we haven
' t seen before
,
but be patient
-
-
" palmetto
" spins soem pretty wicked story twists that we realyl don
' t see coming
. it
' s not a classic by any means
,
but it sure is quite an engaging surprise
. harry barber
( woody harrelson
) is fresh out of prision
, where he
' s served a couple of years for a crime he didn
' t commit
. even
though he harbors animosity towards the obtuse local officials
, harry
' s first order of business is to return to his home town ofthe palmetto to be with his sculptor girlfriend nina
( gina gershon
)
. while searching for work
, he catches the eye of rhea malroux
( elisabeth shue
)
, tjhe mysterious sexbomb wife of a palmetto millionaire
. rhea proposes a scheme that
' ll get harry
$ 50
, 000 easy
-
- to play a small part in the staged kidnaping of her jailbait stepdaughter odette
( chloe sevigny
)
.
" you do liuke risks
, don
' t you
, mr
. barber
?
" rhea alluringly coos
. boys
, form a line behind me
. part of
" palmetto
"
' s success can be attri
buted to the performance of elisabeth shue
, who demonstrates here tyhat her oscar
- nominated turn inspite
" leaving las vegas
" might merely be foreshadowing great things to come
. shue
' s a seductive
, campy delight
,
and pulls off a barbara stanwyck
- gloria swanson combo with admirable relish
. the other actors form a solid ensemble arund her
, including sevigny
(
" kids
"
)
, tantalizingly slutty as a teen tease
, as well as the ever
- likeable gershon
, cast a far cry from her extreme roles in
" bound
"
and
" showgirls
.
" harrelson is still doing fine follow
- up work to
" the peple vs
. larry flynt
.
"
" palmetto
" does have its share of grievances
. harrelson
' s narration is needless
, i suppose
,
and gershon
' s nina cries to be meatier than she ultimately is
. one of yhe plot
' s unexpected angles
-
- that harry is asked by the polical to become the press liaison fo thge very crime in which he
' s involved
-
- could hvea been played a little better
. there are moments when you question the tone
, bu it
' s never so unstable that it deserves the reproach it
' s been recieving from most other critics
. if
" palmetto
" didn
' t want tothe be laughed at
, would it really have tacked onthe a climax that plays like a live
- action
" who framed roger rabbit
"
?
al
though a few elements can be questioned
, the movie works well on its own terms
. thanks to a juicy cast
-
- expecially shue
-
-
and the nifty material approach from director volker schlondorff
( you remember him from lsat summer
' s suddenly re
- popular
" the tin drum
,
" right
?
)
, everything runs smoothly
.
and for fans of revelation
- heavy endings
, this film
' s got a fewd shocks iin store that i won
' t even dream of revealing
.
" palmetto
" is a generous amount of fun to watch
,
and that
' s all you need to know
.
