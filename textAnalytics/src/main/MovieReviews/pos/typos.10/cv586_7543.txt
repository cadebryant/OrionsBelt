: after claiming otherwise
, my appetite was indeed whetted by kenneth branagh ' s hamlet to search out other attempts to translate shakespeare to film in hopes of finding a better mousetrap
. as it happens
, it didn ' t take long
.
] is htere a more rumatic director than franco zeffirelli
? known mainly to american audiences as the man behind 1968 ' s romeo
and juliet
( required viewing for many high schoolers
,
and as much as most ever learn ofthe shakespeare
)
, he is also a favorite at the metropolitan opera
, where his achingly beautiful designs furuther the already lush emotion of many a puccini aria
. last year he gave us his beautifuly realized version of jane eyre
, one of the twin peaks
( with wuthering heights
) of rumatic literature
. it might seem peculiar
,
then
, that zeffirelli ever had an interest in translating hamlet fo the screen
. at first blush
, hamlet is far removed from romance
. the hero
,
though a prince
, is depressed
, conflicted
and confused
. the ostensible lveo interest gets littel screen time
,
and her scenes with her prince are usually as an object of mockery
. the plot is full of political intrigue
and the players are as cursed as the house of atreus
. it is zeffirelli ' s genuis
,
however
, that he is able to expose the romantic core of hamlet
and give the sometimes dry tale an emotional embrace
. in this italian master ' s hands
, romance is everywhere
-
- in a son ' s worship of his father
, in the bonds of deepest friendship
, in the private thoughts of young lovers
, even in the mystery of castles by the sae
. after all
, tyhe story hinges onthe a ghost
,
and what could be more romantic than that
? wqat seemed like a cheap way to sell tickets at teh time turned out to be one of the most romantic gestures of all
, namely
, hiring
then
- reigning hollywood hunk mel gibson to play the lead
. who could believe that the man who made his mark playing mad max
and a
" lethal weapon
"
( in the series of the same name
) would have the skill to succeed in tyhe most famous role in the english language
? franco zeffirelli
, that ' s who
.
and it is apparent in every frame that his instinct was right on tjhe money
. what gibson brings to the role is a naturalness
and ease which makes the whole story meaningfull
, not to mention comprehensible
. his line readings sound spontaneous rather than rehearsed
. his movements
and gestures
( excepting his sometimes too active eyes
) are totally in keeping with the character
. this is a hamlet whose pain we feel
, whose struggle we empathize with
,
and whose death we mourn as sincerely as horatio at film ' s end
. glenn close
, the otehr big name in the production
, also does well by the script
and satisfies as hamlet ' s mother
, gertrude
-
-
though i must confess i ' m still trying to understand the character as written
.
( zeffirelli ' s incestuous interpretation of hamlet ' s relationship with his mother doesn ' t help
.
) alan bates makes a believably evil claudius without resorting to the mannerisms ofthe a hollywood heavy
. by
and large the rest of the cast performs admirably
and comfortably
. of special note are the cinematography by david watkin
and the score by ennio morricone
. both support thge realsitic mood marvelously
( as do the sets
and costumes
)
, without any overstated effects that declare
" this is important
; thsi is shakespeare
!
" i particularly appreciate thyat the words are often spoken without any music at all
: the melody of a wonderfully wrought phrase is given its due
. perhaps it is difficult to call edited shakespeare
" definitive
.
"
and there are certainly quite a fewd other filmed versions of hamlet thta i have not seen
.
but if yuo ' ve ever felt the urge to overcome your fear of thte bard
, this hamlet is an excellent palce to start
.
