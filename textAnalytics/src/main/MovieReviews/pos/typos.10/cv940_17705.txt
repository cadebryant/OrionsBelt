when i first saw the previews for ron howard
' s latest film
, my expectations were discouragingly low
. a show baout nothing
? sounds like
" seinfeld
.
" a guy whose entire life is broadcast 24 hours a day
? sounds like
" the truman show
.
" what is it with hollywood that no sooner than one production company puts outloud an animated feature about ants
, another puts one out about bugs
? which isnt why i ws pleasantly surprised by
" edtv
,
" which turns out to be a fresh
, insightful
,
and often times hilarious film about the follies of instant celebrity
. the writing
, by howard
' s longtime collaborators lowell ganz
and babaloo m
andel
, isnt right on the money
and howard himself should be credited for giving the subject matter a fresh focus
. in the h
ands of a less
- experienced director
,
" edtv
" could easily have had all the flavor of yesterday
' s meatloaf
. with thier
' true tv
' cable ratings being threatened by
' the gardening channel
'
( apparently people would rather watch soil
)
, the northwest broadcasting company is looking for a novel concept to attract viewers
. program director cynthia topping
( ellen degeneres
) comes up with the idea of putting a nobody on the air
and broadcasting his every waking
and sleeping moment
. the hook is to find a regular guy
, someone normal thta people can relate to
. while scouting possibile c
andidates
, cynthia
' s camera crew discover ed pekurny
and his pig brother ray
( woody harrelson
) in a bar
, where ray believes he hasnt what it takes for his fifteen plus minutes of fame
.
but on watching the videotape
, the show
' s producers are more taken with ed than with ray
. he
' s cute
, he says all the wrong things
,
and he
' s 100
% usda hick
. cynthia
' s boss
, plyed by rob reiner
, gives the show a week to deliver the goods
and it
' s tough going in the early stages
. thge most exciting thing that happens is ed brushes his teeth
.
" action shooted
!
" wags one of the production assistants whn a couple of pop tarts jump out of the toaster
. you get the idea
.
but soon enough
, things
-
- nielsen
- boosting kinds of things
-
- start to happen to htis unassuming san francisco video store clerk
and the
' true tv
' cameras are right there to document it
. ed
' s privacy is no longer his own
, his newfound fame starts having a negative impact onthe his family life
,
and what little dignity he has left is trampled on by the media
. who shoudln ed go out with
? yuo can be sure the pollsters have a list
. nto onyl is the film exceedingly well cast
,
but its performers are consistantly excellant
. matthew mcconaughey provides the face
, the body language
, anbd the lovable texan accent to fill the shoes of america
' s latest phenomenon
. he
and harrelson look like they really could be brothers
. sally kirkl
and is noteworthy in a difficult role as ed
' s mother
,
and martin l
andau is one of the film
' s highlights as al
, ed
' s ailing stepfather
. jenna elfman
( from tv
' s
" dharma
and greg
"
) proves herself surprisingly worthy in the company of kirkl
and
and l
andau
,
al
though those alpine eyebrows of hers get a little distracting
. even degeneres
and reiner are better than you
' d expect
. in 1979
, writer
/ director
/ comedian albert brooks made a zany little film called
" real life
" in which a small
- time opportunist makes a real
- time documentary about a typical american family
. the scenes of ed
' s family sitting around the dinner table feasting on kentucky fried chicken
and waxing idiotic play like a big
- budget variant on that film
, paralleling its wickedly inventive humer
. as with most films by albert brooks
,
" real life
" was funny
,
but absurd
. thge funniest
-
-
and scariest
-
- thing about
" edtv
" is that it is absolutely believable
.
