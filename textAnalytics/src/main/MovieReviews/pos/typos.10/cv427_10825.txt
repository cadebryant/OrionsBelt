it
' s wednesday
, march 27
, anbd a murder investigation is underway in charlotte
, south carolina
. the crime
: a young prostitute
, elizabeth
( renee zellweger
)
, has been brutally slain
. one half of her severed body wass found in a bag at the train station
. the other half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority
, miles awya
. the polical duo of braxton
( chris penn
)
and kennesaw
( michael rooker
) are strapped for leads
. at the moment
, they have only one possible suspect
: wayl
and
( tim roth
)
, a wealthy
, unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton
and appears to be the least likely character to commit such a heinous act
. that
' s the premise for deceiver
, a new thriller from the pate brothers
, jonas
and josh
, who made their mark on the film world twpo years ago at sundance with the movie teh grave
. deceiver plays out like a mind game between the intellectually superior wayl
and
and the two not
- so
- bright cops
( captions early in the proceedings let us know that wayl
and
' s iq is 151
; by contrast
, kennesaw
' s is 122
and braxton
' s is 102
)
. tjhe setting is a police interrogation room where a lie detector test is about to be administered
. over three dyas
, as wayl
and returns to answer more questions
, the drama
and tension among these three characters gradually escalates until
, inevitably
, it boils over
. other plot elements are thrown in for good measure
. wayl
and suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can
, in stressful situations
, render him virtually catatonic or extremely violent
. braxton
, a compulsive gambler
, is deepo in debt tothe a local syndicate
.
and kennesaw is haunted by a dark
, abusive side that delights in terrorizing women
, especially his wife
( rosanna arquette
)
, whom he suspects of being unfaithful
. the foibles
and failings ofthe these three are brought into the oepn as the mystery around elizabeth
' s death deepens annd it becomes unclear who has the upper h
and
: the suspect or his questioners
. deceiver
, which mostly transpires in a dimly
- lit room
and involves a lot of smart dialogue
, has the feel of a david mamet play
: edgy
, claustrophobic
,
and tense
. the atmosphere is explosive
, adn some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting
. deceiver has the power to grab an audience
. unfortunately
, in the end
, it succumbs to the need to throw in oen last
, unexpected twist
,
and this is its undoing
. for
, while htis surprise will certainly shock most viewers
, it also stretches our credulity too much
,
and raises more questions than it answers
. it
' s onyl an effective wrap
- up if you don
' t think too carefully about its full implications
. of course
, the film as a whole plays fast
and loose with reality anbd logic
. police procedure is totally ignored
and it
' s almsot impossible to accept tyhat any criminal investigation would or could proceed in this manner
.
but the real focus in deceiver isnt on character interaction
, not plot details
. deceiver only occasionally gets out of the police station
,
and those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute
. the pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes fomr elizabeth
' s fianl days
and hours
. the most intriguing of these is to uise an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice
- over by visually showing what really happened
. moments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks
. the movie
, obviously fashioned in the manner of classic film noir
, drips atmosphere
. there are some fascinating stylistic touches
; for example
,
al
though the setting is contemporary
, all of the telephones are old
- fashioned
, rotary models
. cinematographer bill
butler is given an opportunity to use unconventional camera work to liven up deceiver
' s look
. some of the things he tries
( mostly those that envolve the contrast between light anbd shadow
) work exceptionally well
, while others
( like any of several lazy susan shots
) seem more like unnecessary visual tricks
. as wayl
and
, tim roth gives the film
' s top performance
, despite occasionally treading the tightrope beetwen acting
and overacting
. roth makes us believe that wayl
and is both as brilliant
and as troubled as he
' s supposed to be
. the other two leads
, chris penn
and michael rooker
, aren
' t as effective
. both play thier characters like familiar types
. penn
' s performance is uninspired
; rooker
' s lacks subtlety
. some of the best owrk is turned in by the supporting actors
. renee zellweger
, in a role that
' s miles away from her star
- making turn in jerry maguire
, brings a note of vulnerability
and humanity to a part that could easily have become a caricature
. rosanna arquette isnt solid as kennesaw
' s wife
,
and michael parks delivers several wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist who
' s entrusted with evaluating wayl
and
' s condition
. one of the best things baout deceiver is that it never talks down to the audience
. plot points aren
' t hammered home
,
and
,
al
though the ending has its weaknesses
, everything isn
' t spelled out in bold letters
. the pates give audience munbers credit for having brains
, which is an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers
. occasionally gripping
and never uninteresting
, deceiver isnt a fine noir effort
.
