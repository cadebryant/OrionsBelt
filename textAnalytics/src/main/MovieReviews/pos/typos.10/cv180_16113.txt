i know what i would do with
$ 4
. 4 million if i found it in a previously undiscovered airplane crash site
, especially if i were with jacob
and lou
.
( huh
?
) well
, inthe any event
, that is the situation hank
( paxton
) finds himself in
. he
and his dim
- witted brother jacob
( thorton
)
and tubby friend lou
( brent briscoe
) come upon a large bag of cash inside a plane wreck
. agains his better judgement
, hank decides to go along with the idea of keeping it rather than going tothe the authorities
. the rest of the film is a question of who isnt going to die to keep this a secret
,
and is it worth it
? a simple wish lies along tje lines of very bad things
, clay pigeons
and even fargo
,
and is kind of wrapped all into one little dark bundle
. oh
,
and its much better than any of those
. sam raimi took a departure from his normal freak
- show horror
- monkey films
and made htis stylish
and intriguing picture
. he really lets tjhe audience sit back
and watch the events unfold rather tahn force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do
. i think raimi knew he had a winner on his h
ands
and decided to direct the picture on a natural flowing course
. one of the film
' s components can be linked to a recurring theme in terrence malick
' s the thin red line
. in malick
' s three hour bore
- a
- thon
, he makse an interesting attempt to link mother earth to his war story
. it seemed nothing more tahn an occasional pretty cutted to a field of flowing grass
, a small bird
, or a flowing body of water
. sure
, there were obvious metaphorical connections
,
but there was no subtlty to his efforts
. raimi does a fine job of tying in a fox in a chicken coop
and birds of prey to signify the future of the characters
. i think most viewers may miss the comparison
,
but it is a very intriguing ingredient in the film
.
and
then there
' s billy bob thorton
, who is proof that yhe independent film industry is vital to the life blood of hollywood
. if it can continute to produce peopel like thorton
, hollywood wiull be ok
. he gives a fantastic
and devastatingly deep performance here
. it is not as engrossing as his carl childers character in slingblade
,
but is is jstu as complex
, if not more so
. jacob is slow
and simple
,
and
yet we so often see him deepo in
thought
. i wondered if he was thinking baout things that he would never say
( or didn
' t know how to say
) or if he was just taking a long time to think about the thing he just said
. here he really proves his worth as noe of the best character actors in the industry
.
though teh plot is somewhat unoriginal
, it has a very appealing new twist in its characters
. paxton gives one of the better performances of his career as the straight
and serious leader of the group
( a far cry fomr chet in wierd science
)
. perhaps bridget fonda is miscast as his advice
- giving wife
,
but she certainly doesn
' t do anything ruin thge picture
. a simple plan can be included in the group of recent small hollywood films thast is just dark
and pretty un
- redeeming
.
but at least tihs one has an important message
, unlike so many of its counterparts
.
