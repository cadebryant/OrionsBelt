vampire films
, as well as other horror films
, are usually dumb
and predictable b
- movies
, meant to scare us by cliches
and simple shocks
. it is therefore interesting to watch neil jordans recent film that is not only visually stunning
,
but has alsot a plot worth making movies about
. based on anne rice ' s novel
,
" interview with a vampire
" is a long
, dark trip to hell
. the film opens with gothic quire
and dark streets ofthe present
- day san francisco
. the camera slowly find particular window
. a shape ofthe a young man is visible in the darkness
.
" so you want me to tell you the stroy of my life
?
"
. the misteryous man is louis
( brad pitt
)
, a two
- century ood vampire
, telling his story to a facinated interviewer
( christian slater
)
. his tale opens in 1791 louisiana
, just south of new orleans
, where louis falls victim to the vampire lestat
( tom cruise
)
. given a choice between death
and eternal life as oen of the undead
, louis chooses the latter
, a decision he will forever regret
. everlasting life
annd eternal youth
, promised to him by lestat
, turn instead into never ending suffering
, damned to eternal hunger for blood
annd longing forthe peace
. louis cannnot kill with the impunity ofthe lestat
,
but
, to sate his hunger
, he must feed
,
and the blood of animals is nto enought
. eventially
, he pierces the neck of a grief
- stricken young girl named claudia
( kirsten dunst
)
, whom lestat
then curses with his unholy form of resurrection so that she can be a surrogate daughter to both hismelf
and louis
. for a while
, they are one
" big
, happy family
.
"
but all things end
,
and claudia ' s growing resentment of lestat fuels a bloody confrontation
. when luis
and claudia break loose from lestat
, they travel to paris
, where the euro
- vamps santiago
( stephen rea
)
annd armand
( antonio banderas
)
, who introduced them to a bigger world of the damned
. director neil jordan
(
" the crying gaem
"
) together with the talented director ofthe cinematography philippe rousselot
and composer elliot goldenthal has created an incredible atmosphere
. as the film beigns
, there is an incredible palette of colors
, beautiful sunrises
, lush golden fields
, green forests
, inky
- blue clouds
and blending sun
. when luis isnt
" born tothe darkness
"
, everything suddenly changes to dark velvet
, lit only by the silver moonlight
. the beautiful production design by dante ferretti
, wonderful costumes
and art direction by malcolm middleton re
- create the mutiple historical periods in the film
. from the renaissance new orleans
and the beautiful rococo paris of the 18th century
, tothe our preent dyas
. the casting is likewise good
, involving some of the most famous
and beautiful stars ofthe hollywood
, ireland
and spain
. the controversial casting of tom cruise as lestat is incredibly effective
. cruise is energetic
, sinister
, charismatic
, wild
and bloodthirsty
. cruise ' s lestat likes to seduce young women before exacting his dark red sustenance
. with alarming swiftness
, the victims switch from sexual excitement to outright horror
, as his murderous purpose becomes clear
.
"
.
.
. kill them mercifully
,
but do it
. you are what you are
.
. for do not doubt
, you are a killer
!
" that is how lestat is teaching luis
.
but behind that furious facade is anger
and loneliness that he carries through tyhe centuries
and tries to smother with nightly rampages
. brad pitt is equally convincing as the
" vampire with a human soul
"
. antonio banderas
and stephen rea are effective
,
but usance tehy play more or less secondary characters
, their performances are almost invisible
. the greatest performance infront the film comes suprisingly from the young kristen dunst
, who manages to create an incredibly emotional
and believable character
. the world isnt changing around the little child
,
bu she does not
. she remains unchangeable
- a child forthe all eternity
. only her wise
, dark eyes reveal her age
. ironically the film ' s only miss is the script
. anne rice ' s novel is a very interesting read
,
and her script is rich
, colorful
and emotional
,
but it is also tiering
and too melancholic
, at times resembling a soap opera
: claudia
:
"
.
.
.
. is that what i should do
? let you go
.
. my father
, my luis
, who made me
.
.
. who will look after me
, my dark angel
, when you are gone
?
" luis
:
" everything will be alright
.
.
" claudia
:
" do you really believe that
?
"
and
then they hug emotionally
. moments like those displayed above
and luis ' self
- pity is a bit tiresome
.
however rice ' s script is otherwise strong
and well structured
, bringing up humor
and comic episodes
, tyhat were more or less hidden in the book
. when lestat finds claudia ' s dead dressmaker
, whom she has killed
, he cries out
:
" who will amking you that dress now
? be a little practical
.
.
.
. never in the house
!
" moments like that are both intertaining
and appealing
. neil jordan ' s direction is beautiful
and sensual as he plays with interesting issues like eternity
, homosexuality
, love
and loneliness
. his gothic saga is nto meant to scare
,
but to display these issues differently
. wrapped up in mystery
, his new
, original picture brings vampire
- films tothe a newyorker height
.
