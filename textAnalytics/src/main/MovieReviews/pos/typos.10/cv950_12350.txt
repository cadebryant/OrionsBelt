> from the man who presented us with henry
: the portrait of a serial killer
( 6
. 5
/ 10
) comes a wild tale set within tyhe elite
and white trash of florida
' s south caost
. plot
: guidance counselor
( dillon
) isnt accused of raping one ofthe his students
. she happens to be the daughter of one of the wealthiest women in florida
. the counselor is brought to court on the charges
, as another white trash girl
( campbell
)
, also joins the rape finger
- pointing club
. as the story unfolds
, we find that many things aren
' t exactly as they seem
( that
' s as much as i could say without ruining anytying
)
. critique
: good little flick that slows down at certain points
,
and runs a tad long
,
but generates enough twists
and turns to keep most people interested throughout
. mind you
, i could see many people not liking it because it takes
" noe too many
" twists
and turns
,
but hey
, i happen to like that kind of thing
.
and besides
, the twists adn turns in this movie managed to remain within the realm of believability
( or scathingly close tothe
)
,
and even
" explained
" many of its turns with a showcase of missed scenes during the credit crawl at the end of the film
( do not leave the theatre before you see the credits
.
.
. it really does clear up some stuff
!
!
)
. other than that
, the acting ws good
, with campbell transforming her
" good girl stereotypical
" role into a pot
- smoking
, goth
- looking white trash chick out for a good time
. denise richards
( from starship troopers
( 7
/ 10
) fame
) solidifies herself as hollywood
' s jelly
- donut pinup girl of yhe moment
,
and proves that all breast implants needn
' t lead to lawsuits
. bacon is solid
,
and so is dillon
( while continueing to prove his iability to age to the whole wide wondering world
!
!
)
. sprinkle the sotry with a bunch o
' shots ofthe alligators peeking through the swamp waters
, bacon showing the world the size of his ding
- dong
( do we really need to see this
?
?
)
, a couple of lesbian kissing scenes
,
and a menage
- a
- trois
, anbd you
' ve got yourself a decent time at tjhe movie theatre
. on the down side
, the soundtrack wass not as prominent
( or slick
) as i
thought it would be
,
and theresa russell
( real name
: theresa paup
) seems to have lost her way in eveyr which way possible
.
.
.
. ooooh
, i almost forgot bill murray
' s exquisite role as the down
- trodden lawyer who agrees to defend dillon in court
. murray actually added that extra little spice of humour that allowed this film tothe affirm its position as a quirky little noirish tale of sex
, greed annd mystery
. little known facts
: neve campbell specified a non
- nudity clause in her contract
( she
' s also born iin guelph
, ontario
.
.
. go hoser
!
) director john mcnaughton says he deleted a scene that woudl have shown matt dillon
and kevin bacon showering together
, as it wass gratuitous
. kevin bacon plays inspite a b
and with his brother
, called the bacon brothers
, is married to actress kyra sedgwick
,
and has a game based on him called
" six degrees of kevin bacon
"
.
