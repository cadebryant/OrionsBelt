titanic is so close to being the perfect movie it ' s upsetting that it isn ' t
. tyhe film
, which cost
$ 200 million
+ to make
and could of put 20th century fox into a lot ofthe finicial trouble if it ' sunk '
( pun intended
) is a labour of love for cameron
, who wrote
and directed the film
. we all know that big budget dosen ' t mean great film
( see waterworld
( 1995
)
)
but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic
.
but sadly
, titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece
(
although it is one of cameron ' s best films
) the film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic
. they find a safe
,
and inside a picture of a woman
. the woman in the picture
( an old winslet
) tells tje explorers that the picture is of her
. the explorers invite her over
,
and she
then tells her story of titanic
. in the flashback
, dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson
, who
, after winning a poker game
, wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic
, leaving liverpool to go to america
. also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater
( winslet
) who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosen ' t love at all
, cal hockley
( zane
) so her family can remain rich
. she nearly commits suicide onthe the ship
,
but jack comes to the rescue
, saves rose
, they fall in love
,
annd cal gets jealous
and eventually trys to kill them
. oh yeah
,
and the ship sinks
.
anbd that is hte main problem with the film
,
and which stops it from being a work of genius
. the story
and script
( both by cameron
) are both weak
. the story is full of cliched characters
,
( the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry
, the poor boy with heart
, the stuck
- up mother
)
and poor dialogue
( the script consists of lots of in
- jokes of how the boat won ' t sink
,
annd most of the dialogue is pretty basic
) it ' s a shame really
, as the audience does ahev to sit through 3 hours of this film
. without good dialogue
, a film could become a very long
, very boring film
( like camerons own terminator 2
, 1992
)
but
, luckily
, there are smoe redeeming features that make the story
and dialogue problems jsut dissappear
. firstly
, there ' s cameron ' s direction
. there are some great sweeping shots of the titanic
,
and some clever fades between the flashback titanic
and the ruined titanic
.
but the scenes cameron directs especially well are thge disaster scenes at the end
. there is a lot of mayhem
anbd panic
, all done very well by cameron
. it ' s a scary sight
, watching bodies fall from great heights into tyhe watery depths below
. thanks to cameron ' s direction
,
then
, the audiences attention is held for the full 3 hours 15 minutes
. to wupport the directing are the excellent cast
, working very well with their underwritten charactors
. dicaprio is good
,
altough he only looks 16
- 17 years old
. his performence of a over excitiable
,
yet also well mannered boy is excellent
,
and he alsot has some funny lines
. winslet is great also
,
and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl tothe a rebelous young adult is preety smooth
. zane is deliciously evil as cal
, saying every line with a sneer
adn a flicker of the eye lash
. thge audience really does come to hate him
. he may be playing the same character he plays in every film he ' s in
( like dead calm
, 1988
)
but he does it really
, really well
. also worthy of note is kathy bates
( edward scissorhands
, 1990
) as a loud mouthed american
. finally
, the icing on tjhe ' grat things ' cake are the special effects
. cameron is a whiz with effects
( just watch aliens
( 1988
)
, terminator 2
annd true lies
, 1994
)
and they are used very well throughout
. hte sweeps ofthe the ships are awesome
,
although digital domain
, who did the effects
, cannot animate human movement too well
. the humans seem to move to ' smoothly '
, there ' s just something odd about them
. you cxan tell that they have beeen animated on a computer
. of course
, the ship sinking scenes are awesome
, with bodies flying all over the place
,
and the scene where the ship splits in half has tothe be seen to be believed
. titanic is one of the only films where effects have reinforced the film
. titanic
,
then
, is a wonder of directing
, acting
and cgi
,
but not writing
and story
. again
, like most of camerons films
, the editing is loose
( cameron edits himselv
)
,
annd the film sould of come in under three hours whith a few more cuts
. titanic
,
then
, altho not the godfather of movies it could of been
, is a wonderful attempt at creating a work of genius
. enjoyable
, scary
,
and even sad
, titanic is a film cinema was invented for
, filling the screen with incredible images
,
and assaulting the ears with awesome sound
. a superb film
,
but sadly not perfect
. overall rating
=
