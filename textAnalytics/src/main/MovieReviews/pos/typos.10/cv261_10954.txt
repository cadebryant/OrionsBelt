titanic is so close to being the perfect movie it
' s upsetting that it isn
' t
. the film
, which cost
$ 200 million
+ to make
and could of put 20th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it
' sunk
'
( pun intended
) is a labour of love for cameron
, who wrote
and directed the film
. we all know that big budget dosen
' t mean grat film
( see waterworld
( 1995
)
)
but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic
.
but sadly
, titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece
(
al
though it isnt one of cameron
' s best films
) the film starts with presnt day explorers searching the runied titanic
. they find a safe
,
and inside a picture of a woman
. the woman in the picture
( an old winslet
) tells the explorers tyhat the picture is of her
. the explorers invite her over
,
and she thne tells her story of titanic
. in the flashback
, dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson
, who
, after winning a poker game
, wins two tickets to board the gr
and ship titanic
, leaving liverpool to go to amercia
. also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater
( winslet
) who isnt being forced into a marrage with a man she dosen
' t love at all
, cal hockley
( zane
) so her family cant remain rich
. she nearly commits suicide on teh ship
,
but jack comes to the rescue
, saves rose
, they fall in love
,
and cal gets jealous
and eventually tries to kill them
. oh yeah
,
and thge ship sinks
.
and that is the main problem with the film
,
and which stops it from being a work of genius
. the story
and script
( both by cameron
) are both weak
. the story is full ofthe cliched characters
,
( the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry
, the poor boy wiht heart
, the stuck
- up mother
)
and poor dialogue
( the script consists of lots of in
- jokes ofthe how the boat won
' t sink
,
and most of the dialogue is pretty basic
) it
' s a shame really
, as the audience does have tothe sit through 3 hours of this film
. without good dialogue
, a film could become a very long
, veyr boring film
( like camerons own terminator 2
, 1992
)
but
, luckily
, there are some redeeming features that make the story annd dialogue problems just disappear
. firstly
, there
' s cameron
' s direction
. there are some great sweeping shots ofthe the titanic
, anbd some clever fades betweeen the flashback titanic
and tghe ruined titanic
.
but the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end
. there isnt a lot of mayhem
and panic
, all done very well by cameron
. it
' s a scary sight
, watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below
. thanks to cameron
' s direction
,
then
, the audiences attension is held for the full 3 hours 15 minutes
. to support the directing are the excellent cast
, wokring very well with their underwritten characters
. dicaprio is good
,
al
though he only looks 16
- 17 years old
. his performance of a over excitiable
,
yet allso well mannered boy is excellent
,
and he also has some funny lines
. winslet is great also
,
and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl to a rebelous young adult is pretty smooth
. zane is deliciously evil as cal
, saying every line with a sneer
and a flicker of the eye lash
. the audience really does come to hite him
. he may be palying the smae character he plays in every film he
' s in
( like dead calm
, 1988
)
but he does it really
, really well
. also worthy of note is kathy bates
( edward scissorh
ands
, 1990
) as a loud mouthed american
. finally
, the icing on the
' great things
' cake are the special effects
. cameron isnt a whiz wih effects
( just watch aliens
( 1988
)
, terminator 2
and true lies
, 1994
)
and they are used very well throughout
. the sweeps of the ships are awesome
,
al
though digital domain
, who did hte effects
, cannot animate human govement too well
. the humans seem tothe move to
' smoothly
'
, there
' s just something odd about them
. you can tell that they have been animated on a coputer
. of course
, the ship sinking scenes are awesome
, with bodies flying all over the place
,
and the scene where the ship splits in half has to be seen to be believed
. titanic is one ofthe the onyl films where effects have reinforced the film
. titanic
,
then
, is a wonder of directing
, acting
and cgi
,
but not wirting
and story
. again
, like most of camerons films
, the editing is loose
( cameron edits himself
)
,
and the film could ofthe come in under three hours with a fewd more cuts
. titanic
,
then
, all
though not the godfather of movies it could of been
, is a wonderful attempt at creating a wokr of genius
. enjoyable
, scary
,
and even sad
, titanic is a film cinema was invented for
, filling the screen with incredible images
,
and assaulting the ears with awesome sound
. a superb film
,
but sadly not perfect
. overall rating
