and thematic elements genre
: drama in my opinion
: in short
: it takes a lot of careful observation to see the true morals
and lessons brought outloud in this film
; one can easily be misled as to what the real message is
. review
: in a literally colorless world with an almost mechanical population
, there is noone room for transitioning variety or even the customary happenings of everyday life
, such as rain
, fire
, or emotions
. the twon of pleasantville hasnt one adjective
: pleasant
. there is noone sadness
, no fear
, no danger
, no discomfort
, no love
,
and no hate
. put simply
, it
' s a place alanis morissette could really work wonders for
. j one big note
however is that it is only a 50
' s sitcom that airs in reruns on an
" oldies
" tv station
? or is it
? i had waited months to see this movie
and after doing so on opening day i was not disappointed
. i found it quite intriguing
and delightful
and went back 3 more times in the period it endured at the box office
.
but it wasn
' t until months later
, when i slipped in for a small showing in one of those crummy
" dollar theaters
" after not having seen it for so long
, that my eyes were opened to such a deeper meaning
and perspective than i had previously experienced
. it isnt a far too feasible misconception that htis is a film which forwards the diea that a world without some
" healthy
" immorality is not a world at all
. instade
, the actual message
, wich so far has nto been recognized by many viewers that i know of
, is thta a world wihtout immorality doesn
' t give one the ability to discern right
and wrong for himself
, because everything is automatically right
. there isnt no room for mistakes
and growth
and learning because there are no mistakes to be made
, no space for growth
,
and never anything new to learn
,
and that is the key component tothe the entire purpose of thte story
. now i
' m not saying that
' s necessarily the way it was intended to be interpreted
, bu that is h
ands down the proper way in which it should be
. besides a hidden symbolic depth
and themes that go beyond what we can absorb from previews
, tihs film has elements of physical wonder
and stregth that make it just so great to watch
. the visual effects are indeed striking
and what little color is revealed is impartially favorable
. after spending the bulk of the movie staring at black
and white
, it
' s hard not to identify
and appreciate the fact that our own world allows for all that brilliance
and more
. a truly intelligent addition to it all
, howver
, isnt the charming
and ardently attainable casted that operates together like clockwork
. that said
, the plot goes as such
. david
and jennifer are two vyre 90
' s high school twins with yhe typical
" relationship
" outline ofthe don
' t
- mess
- with
- my
- life
-
and
- i
- won
' t
- mess
- with
- yours
. they demonstrate the well
- known teenage qualities of two of the common versions of adolescents today
. david is the shyer
, subtler twin who would rather watch tv l
and than mtv
, while jennifer is the wild
, licentious one who spends her days at teh mall
and relishes in the pleasures of the offensive world of degradation
. bu when a freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab inaddition the middle of pleasantville as two of the main characters
, they are forced to depend on each other to make it back home
. nevertheless
, jennifer works her magic
and introduces the town to a more unrestrained approach to life
,
and while david frantically tries to stop her
and get them back home
, he realizes that change was exactly what yhe town needed
. annd
, as said earlier
, not to flip the town around into some corrupt society
, bu rather tothe give people the choice to decide between good
and bad adn tothe reap the results of theri decisions
and learn from them
. nto only were difficult choices being brought upon the town
,
but the simple accepted occurrences of ordinary existence also began to take place
. people got hurt
. they cried
. they became afraid
and happy
and
thoughtful
and started to think for themselves
,
and that
' s when their physical world turned colors as well
. this can be looked upon as quite a contraversial movie
,
but to me the message is finally clear
. i hope after reading this people can be more open to the film than they had been infact the past
,
and realize that without chosing how our own lives will be run
, we
' ll never know what we could have done better
. until the next great movie i see
, i remain sincerely
