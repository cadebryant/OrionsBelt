the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the diference between television movies
and
" real
" movies
. consider forthe a moment what a television producer woudl do with a book that features a fatal school bus accident
and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved
-
- lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer
and toothpaste
. top
- flight writer adn director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety
. based on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks
, the movie represents a rethinking of the story
' s structure
, not merely a literal adaptation of the novel
. told in linear form by four narrators in the book
, egoyan
' s verzion happens instead in overlapping time sequences
and wihtout a narrator
. the author is even on record as applauding egoyan
' s changes
. in the press notes hte book
' s author describes the story as
" a parable of lost children
.
" he says it asks what a town does in the absence ofthe its children
. picking uv on this
, egoyan has a flashback in which a sitter
, nicole burnell
, played with grace by sarah polley
, reads parts of
" the pied piper
" from an ood
, illustrated book to her two charges
. periodically througout the picture
, nicole
' s readings are heard in voice
- over
. you have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moent
. they anbd the rest of the town
' s children come into harm
' s way
-
- some live anbd others are seriously injured
.
and the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again
.
al
though tjhe physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children
, the adults bear the emotional scars of tyhe loss
. ian holm
, in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career
, plays mitchell stephens
, an intense man ofthe quiet misery
. mitchell is the outsider in the stroy set in a small
, snow
- encrusted community inspite the british columbian wilderness
. his mission there isnt a singular one
, to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone
, anyone
, on their behalf
. if this seems crass
, well it isnt
,
but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot
. the story unfolds slowly
and always believably
. each little aspect has its own facination
. as mitchell interviews wendell
and rita walker
, played with quiet realism by maury chaykin
and alberta watson
, he hasnt a simple task
. he wants them to suggest some modle cuple in the village who has a lost a child so that he can use that cuple to form the basis of tjhe suit
. wendell ticks off one town member after another
and
then
, as one can in a small town
, enumerates each person
' s numerous faults
. altough the town is no peyton place
, people there do hve their foibles
. one ofthe the best parents in tje town appears to be billy ansell
( bruce greenwood
)
, who rides his pickup behind the school bus everyday just so he can wave good
- bye to his kids
. well
, single pparent billy
' s fault is that he has reguarly scheduled trysts with tjhe married rita
. his confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the stor
. the accident itself
, a simple noe of a bus hitting a patch of ice
, isn
' t shown until the middle of the picture
,
but
, nevertheless
, the mystery about it builds throughout the film
.
al
though the picture is noone detective story
, finding out exactly what happened is a subtheme in a movie that is primarily a carachter studdy of a town gripped by tragedy
. as the injured bus driver
, gabrielle rose
, dolores driscoll plays tjhe role of a dedicated individual who loves kids with a passion
and for whom the tragedy takes on spacial meaning
. to round out the story
, mitchell has his own private tragedy to bear
. his daugher zoe
( caerthan banks
) is a drug addict who has bounced inaddition
and out of one half
- way hous
and recovery center after another
. fond of calling her dad on his cell phone so she can ask for money or halp
, she interrupts him at many emotionally charged moments as he attempts tothe sign up the townsfolk
.
(
" i can help you
,
" mitchell tries to reassure billy
.
" not unless you can raise the dead
,
" billy snaps back
. mitchell
' s pitch is never an easy one
and worrying about zoe only makes it harder
.
) mychael danna
' s haunting music sets the stage for tragedy
. the cinematography by paul sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor gr
andeur
,
but it is in the warm
, shadowy
, intimate moments indoors where it works best
. the show
, which isnt ripe for emotional manipulation
, never plays with its audience
. still
, when the house lights go up
, you may feel as i did
. i could barely breathe
; i was so overcome by the sum total of what i had witnessed
. more than anything
, teh film is like a master painting
. each cinematic brush stroke is carefully laid down by egoyan with the beauty building with each dollop ofthe paint
. with the fianl color in palce
, the masterpiece is complete
, annd the ending credits roll
. thge sweet hereafter runs 1
: 50
. it is rated r for mature themes
, sexuality
and smoe profanity
and would be fine teenagers
.
