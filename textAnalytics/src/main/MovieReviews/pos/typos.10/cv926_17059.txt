billy bob thornton
, who hadnt a sudden rise to fame witht 1996
' s sling blade after spending years as a virtually unknown ctor
and writer
, is becoming one of yhe most versatile
- annd most accomplished
- american actors around at the moment
. as jacob
, the simple
but at times very bright loser brother of bill paxton
' s hank
, thornton gives a performance which shoudl leave an indelible mark on all
but the most hardened viewers
. three men
, hank
( paxton
)
, jacob
( thornton
)
and their friend lou
( brent briscoe
) stumble upon a plane wreck which
, upon closer inspection
, yields a rotting corpse
and a bag full of money
. jacob
and lou want to pocket the cash
. hank
, the smarter
-
and perhaps more naieve
- ofthe the three
, insists on leaving the money for the authorities to find
. eventually
, they agree tothe keep hte cash safe until the plane is foudn
,
and
then splitted the money three ways
. things start going wrong
,
though
, with greed
and violence weaving their ways through their plan
. disaster is sure tothe strike
. director sam raimi
, ofthe the evil dead
and darkman fame
, has made an excellent
and
thought
- provoking film
, worlds away ffrom the comic horror films which made his name
. while there are a couple of moments which might remind one of his earlier work
, raimi has made an intelligent
and mature departure which will hopefully be a sign of even greater films to come
. scott b
. smith
' s screenplay
, based on his novel
( which i haven
' t read
) is a fine example of escalating tension
. hwile it doens remind one of danny boyle
' s shallow grave without the abundance of black humour
, it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality
, or the lack thereof
, found inthe a film with this subject matter
. alar kivilo
' s cinematography reminds one of joel
and ethan coen
' s fargo
, wiht the bleak
, snowy l
andscape almost becoming another character
. danny elfman also does well with his moody
, finely
- written score
. if there
' s a flaw in tghe film
, it
' s that it goes on for just a little too long
. just when we think that they are about to wrap things up
, raimi annd smith decide to let the film go on a littel further
. while tihs isn
' t realy a bad thnig
, it did become a little frustrating at times
( this may have been due to the fact thast i had consumed a large sprite beforeh
and
)
. hte performances are excellent
, with the usually annoying paxton in fine form
and bridget fonda giving a scene
- stealing turn as hank
' s scheming wife
. this is an excellent showcase for thornton
' s fine skills as an actor
and a great change in direction for raimi
, who could very well have a career ahead of him as an accomplished directer of dramtic films
. fingers crossed
,
though
, that this doesn
' t stop him from making another evil dead sequel
.
