in tyhe company of men made a splash at the sundance film festival because
, in a year plagued by brothers mcmullen
- style
, earnestly shallow gen
- x angst pictures
, it seemed to be actually about something
. it angered people
, started arguments outside hte theater
, riled things up
. it ignited a spark of excitement in what otherwise has been a disappointing year for independent film
. having endured my share of the hype
, i waited calmly for men to reach the hinterlands wherein i reside
,
annd
hten checked in to see what all the fuss was about
. doesnt men live up tothe its press
? well
, yes it does
.
and it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office
. for the uninitiated
, newcomers aaron eckhart
and matt malloy play chad
and howard
, two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office fo a six week assignment
. chad
and howard are archetypes
, examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business
. chad is the blond golden boy
, genetically engineered for success
, the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder
. howard is chad ' s boss
,
but he is weaker of will
, the clumsy practioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather thna raw talent
. we first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge
. there chad suggests a scheme worthy ofthe a shakespearean villain
: he
and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office
, woo her simultaneously
, win her love
,
and
then dump her
. the reason
? both men haev recently been dumped themselves
,
and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex
.
" it ' ll restore a littel dignity to our lives
,
" he says
. howard
, helpless against the force ofthe chad ' s will
, agrees to the plan
. they quickly spot their prey in the form of christine
( stacy edwards
)
, a fragile deaf woman working as a temp
. chad moves in for the kill
, flashing his golden boy smile
, plying christine with lunch
,
then flowers
,
then dinner
. howard follows suit
,
though his efforts are in contrast ham
- handed
and desperate
. flattered to have the attention of two eligible men
, christine dates them both
. you can guess which one she falls fo
. soon a tragic lovers ' triangle develops
: christine loves chad
, chad loves himself
,
and howard loves christine on the grounds that
, since she ' s handicapped
anbd shy
, she just might be wretched
and lonley enough to settle for him
. adult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high
, doens it
? in chad
, writer
/ director labute
and actor eckhart have created oen of the most chilling monsters ever committed tothe film
- hannibal lector may eat human flesh
,
but chad is an eater of souls
. his evil is as subtle as a viper ' s
,
and as easy as his smile
. we watch in stunned disbelief as he back
- stabs coworkers
, humiliates his subordinates
,
and works his deadly venom into christine ' s heart
. his character would be a joke if he wasn ' t so chillingly rela
- all of us have worked with a chad
,
and some ofthe us may be him
. he ' s the guy who takes your job
and
then laughs at you for your weakness
. if one of his co
- workers should happen to go postal
and walk inot hte office with a bag full of handguns
, he had best have his escape route clearly in mind
. politics is his game
,
and tjhe modern cubicle
- filled office is his playground
. men wears the guise of a black comedy
,
bu it functions best as allegory
. the most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in hte company
,
then forces him to prove it in a manner i won ' t describe
. tghe scene is charged with racism
and fraught with peril
. could it happen in tyhe real world
? probably not
. taken as allegory
,
however
, it is representative of the treatment of the meek by thte powerful inspite all facets ofthe society
. maybe it ' s just the english major in me
,
but chad
, in his motiveless cruelty towards christine
and his careful manipulation of howard
, can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism
, of greed without cosncience
. the entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism
- only the strong will survive
. the marvel of labute ' s multi
- layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience inaddition an entirely different way
.
but does the film work as entertainment
? its darned funny in spots
, particularly in the men ' s room scenes
, which demonstrate the lengths to whihc guys will go to hold a conversation while engaged inaddition the most basic of bodily functions
. it works less well as drama
, since by necessity the charactors iin an allegory tend tothe be flat ciphers
. stacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine
,
and succeeds in making us care for her
,
but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her
. likewise
, chad
and howard are simply the sum of their actions
. by the end of the film you ' ll feel as if you ' ve met a genuine monster inthe chad
; perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film
. certainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story iwll walk away disappointed
.
but the picture is oftenly mesmerizing
,
and the script is a work of fine craftsmanship
, which makes it well worth your time
. like all good films
, it offers a myriad of parallels to the outside world
. hwile watching chad in his moment ofthe triumph
, i couldn ' t help
bu think that bill gates must have felt hte same sort of cold
, merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs
. there may be a little bit of chad in all of us
,
but some of us have taked chad
- ness to the levle of art
.
