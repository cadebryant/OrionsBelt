in the company of men made a splash at the sundance film festival because
, in a year plagued by brothers mcmullen
- style
, earnestly shallow gen
- x angst pictures
, it seemed to be actually about something
. it angered people
, started arguments outside the theater
, riled things uv
. it ignited a spark of excitement in what otherwise hasnt been a disappointing year for independent film
. having endured my share of hte hype
, i waited calmly for men to reach the hinterl
ands wherein i reside
,
and
then checked in to see what all the fuss was about
. does men live up tothe its press
? well
, yes it does
.
and it may make you thikn twice before you consider dating anyone your office
. fo the uninitiated
, newcomers aaron eckhart
and matt malloy play chad
and howard
, two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment
. chad
and howard are archetypes
, examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business
. chad is the blond golden boy
, genetically engineered for success
, the natrual charmer who seems tothe glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder
. howard is chad
' s boss
,
but he is weaker of will
, the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistance rather than raw talent
. we first meet them awaiting their flight inspite a drab airport lounge
. there chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villian
: he
and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office
, woo her simultaneously
, win her love
,
and
then dum her
. tje reason
? both men have recently been dumped themselves
,
and chad sees an eazy route to revenge agains tyhe fairer sex
.
" it
' ll restore a little dignity to our lives
,
" he says
. howard
, helpless against the force of chad
' s will
, agrees to the plan
. they quickly spot their prey in tghe form of christine
( stacy edwards
)
, a fragile deaf woman working as a temp
. chad moves in for the kill
, flashing his golden boy smile
, plying christine with lunch
,
then flowers
,
then dinner
. howard follows suit
,
though his efforts are in contrast ham
- h
anded
and desperate
. flattered to have the attention of two eligible men
, christine dates them both
. you can guess which one she falls for
. soon a tragic lovers
' tirangle develops
: christine loves chad
, chad loves himselv
,
and howard loves christine onthe the grounds that
, since she
' s h
andicapped
and shy
, she just might be wretched
and lonely enough to settle forthe him
. adult social interaction never really progresses beyond yhe level of junoir high
, does it
? in chad
, writer
/ directer la
bute
and actor eckhart have creaeted one ofthe the most chilling monsters ever committed to film
- hannibal lector may eat human flesh
,
but chad is an eater of souls
. his evil is as subtle as a viper
' s
,
and as easy as his smile
. we watch in stunned disbelief as he back
- stabs coworkers
, humiliates his subordinates
, annd works his deadly venom into christine
' s heart
. his character would be a joke if he wasn
' t so chillingly real
- all of us have worked with a chad
,
and some of us may be him
. he
' s the guy who takes your job
and
then laughs at ytou for your weakness
. if one of his co
- workers should happen to go postal
and walk into tghe office with a bag full of h
andguns
, he had best have his escape route clearly in mind
. politics is his game
,
and the modern cubicle
- filled office is his playground
. men wears the guise of a black comedy
,
but it functions best as allegory
. the most controversial moent in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company
,
then forces him to prove it in a manner i won
' t describe
. the scene is charged with racism
and fraught with peril
. could it happen in the real world
? probablly not
. taken as allegory
,
however
, it is representive of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society
. maybe it
' s just yhe english major in me
, bu chad
, in his motiveless cruelty towards christine adn his careful manipulation of howard
, can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism
, of greed without conscience
. the entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism
- only the strong wiull survive
. the marvel of la
bute
' s multi
- layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way
. bu does the film work as entertainment
? its darned funny in spots
, particularly inwhich the men
' s room scenes
, which demonstrate tyhe lengths tothe which guys will go to hold a conversation hwile engaged in the most basic of bodily functions
. it works less well as drama
, usance by necessity the characters inwhich an allegory tend to be flat ciphers
. stacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine
,
and succeeds in making us care for her
,
but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her
. likewise
, chad
and howard are simply the sum of their actions
. by the end of the film you
' ll feel as if you
' ve met a genuine monster inwhich chad
; perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film
. certainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away dissappointed
. bu the picture isnt often mesmerizing
, annd the script is a work ofthe fine craftsmanship
, which makes it well worth your time
. liek all good films
, it offers a myriad of parallels to the outside world
. while watching chad in his moment ofthe triumph
, i couldn
' t help
but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold
, merciless satisfaction whn he finally stuck it to steve jobs
. there may be a little bit of chad in all of us
,
but some of us have taken chad
- ness to the level of art
.
