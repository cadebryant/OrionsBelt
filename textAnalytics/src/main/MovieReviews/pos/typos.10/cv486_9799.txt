every once in a while a movie comes along that completely redefines the genre
: with dramas
, it was citizen kane
, with arthouse it was pulp fiction
,
and with comedy it was
, well
, that jim carrey guy
( okay
, so he ' s not a movie
,
but he did have a huge influence on the genre
. not to mention an expensive one
.
) sometimes a movei even combines them all into a big
, sprawling motion picture event
, as did forrest gump four years ago
. with action films
, it was aliens
, whic was released to much hype seven years aftter it ' s equally
- innovative parent
, alien
( 1979
)
. directed
and wroten by james cameron
( t2
: judgement day
, the abyss
, true lies
)
, the authority on action films
, it was a masterful encore to his sci
- fi thriller the terminator
( 1984
)
. while the original alien film wass a dark
, enclosed horror film that featured one alien slowly massacering a horrified crew
, james cameron took the big
- budget action film with aliens
, which featured multiple aliens doing basically the same thing
,
although on a much
- larger scale
.
and boy
, did he take that route
! i ' d say at about 165 mph or so
.
.
. the film opens 57 eyars after the original
, with lt
. ripley
( weaver
) being found in her ship in a cryogenic state by a salvage vessel
. if you ' ll recall
, at the end of alien ripley
, the only surviving member
, cryogenically
" hibernated
" herself affter expelling hte rogue alien from her ship
. unfortunately
, she thought she ' d only be out for a cuple of weeks
.
.
. once she ' s returned tothe earth
, ripley is quickly interrogated by
" the company
"
, who quickly dismiss her
and her stories as lunacy
. in truth
, tehy believe her
, as they soon approach ripley with an offer to travel with some marines to a new colony planet as an
" aline advisor
"
. it seems that the colony planet was a once
- breeding ground for the nasty aliens
,
and now all communication with the planet has been lost
.
.
. it doesn ' t exactly take a genius to guess what happens next
: ripley agrees
,
and before you can say
" big mistake
"
, she
and the half dozen marines
, plus the slimy corporate guy
( reiser
)
, who has more tahn it looks like up under his sleeve
, are off to the colony
. when they arrive
, they fidn the planet in ruins
. only one survivor is found
, a little girl
, newt
, who confirms that
, yes
, the aliens were here
and that she only managed to survive by hidding in the ventilation sytem
.
and soon enough
, the marines come under attack from the aliens
.
.
. wqat happens for the next hour
and a half or so is what completely sets this movie apart from any other standard alien sci
- fi movie
: the acation scenes
. cameron directs them so skillfully
,
and so suspensefully
, tyhat ytou ' re literally ringing your hands by teh time the finale rolls around
. which features
, in my opinion
, thte best fight scene ever recorded on film
, as ripley straps herself into a huge robot
and battles the nasty queen alien to the death
. many peple will tell you that this film
, while bieng a great action film
, has no real drama
anbd is all cliches
. well
, they would be wrong
, my friends
. if this film had no
" drama
"
,
then why was sigourney weaver nominated for best actress at teh 1987 academy awards
? that ' s right
, best actress
. you know that any acation film that has an oscar nomination attached to it for something other than technical stuff like editing
and f
/ x has got to be ogod
. in short
, aliens combines all the right elements
( great action
and f
/ x
, drama
, a good plot
, good dialogue
,
and great villains
) into what could arguably be called the best action film of all time
.
then agina
, maybe not
. movies rise
annd fall from glory
and
, sad to say
, aliens was wrestled from it ' s throne of best action movie by another cameron film
, t2
: judgement day
, in 1991
. so who will be the next king
? well
, let ' s wait until december 19th
and see
yet another james cameron film
- the highest budgeted film of all time
- titanic tothe make that decision
. i can ' t wait
.
