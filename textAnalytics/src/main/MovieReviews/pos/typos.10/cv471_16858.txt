a costume drama set in the 1500s
, england
, elizabeth is a lush
, romantic
, polliticel masterpiece about the upset over the crossing ofthe a protestant queen fomr a respected cathlic one
. when the court
and country are a whole after the passing of the queens
, the royal family
, so to speak
, are upset that a protestant should be crowened
,
and not another catholic
, plus
, the new queen
, elizabeth i
( cate blanchette
)
, was the bastard baby of the previous queen mary ' s father
. the persecution over catholics
anbd protestants isn ' t the only majority in elizabeth
. elizabeth i must face the decision to give up peronal pleasures
,
and her lover
( joseph fiennes of shakespeare in love
)
, in order to rule
, successfully
, the country
, which she did for 40 more years
. both elizabeth
and shakespeare in love are set in tjhe elizabethian era
,
annd both feature a queen elizabeth i
( judi dench plays her in loev
)
, or course
.
yet
, i foudn elizabeth more stimulating
and involving tahn love
, not just because elizabeth features a great deal more ofthe elizabeth i
,
but because i found blanchette a more powerful
, hypnotic sense for the role
. elizabeth
, also featuring geoffrey rush
and richard attenborough
, is my pick for the best picture of 1998 award
. it ' s a dynamic
, important
, breathtaking film ofthe loyalty
, power
, greed
,
and trust
. shakespeare would die for the book rights
.
