after a rather disappointing
" mary railly
"
, stephen frears is nowe officially back inwhich business with a comeback worthy of praise
. this is one ofthe the best surprises of thsi season
-
- a sweet
, small budget comedy with a big heart
. in fact it ' s not even a comedy
. it ' s a drama or even more precise
-
- a clever satire on human relationships
and needs
. based on a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by british author nick hornby
,
`
` high fidelity ' ' is a wry
and likable story about a man ' s quest for fulfillment
and happiness
. rob gordon was a dj
. it seems that he could amke everything spin
-
- except his own life
. now he owns championship vinyl
, a little musical store
, somewhere in new york
. when he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend
, a gorgeous blond attorney
, life suddenly looses every purpose
. decimated
, humiliated
and on the verge of a mental
(
and emotional
) breakdown
, he starts meditating over his life
and the way it could have been
-
- baout what ' s right
and what ' s important
. he starts
" categorizing
" life
, dividing it into
" top 5 lists
"
.
and the most important is the
" top 5 list
" over the most painful breakups of his life
, starting with 5th grade
, whn he found his young girlfriend with another boy
.
though you might think that people change
, grow more mature with age
, it just doesn ' t seem that way
and all rob ' s relationships were different versions of that frist
. where did he go wrong
? was it he tyhat screwed up
? or mabey life just stinks
? while he is lost in his own self
- pity
, he must thiunk of hte
" top 5 list
" over his needs for the future
, find the right elements
and mix his life toghether
. with clever parallels to the cult ofthe celebrity
, music
and with incredibly direct narration
, it addresses the average audience member
, in other words
-
- peple like ytou
and me
.
although a lot ofthe this honor should be addressed to the screenwriter
_
_
_
_
_
_
annd frears
, the directer
, the acting is equally important as hte written word
.
anbd here john cusack should absolutely be mentioned
. he is simply superb
. it is as much his movie as it is frears '
. the film would not be the same without him
. cusack
-
- whose character is sadder
, wiser
and 35
-
- brings intelligence
and warmth to post
- mod irony
. most of his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera
-
- not an easy task
-
-
but cusack pulls it off
. his interpretation feels so emotionally right
, so incredibly realistic
and precise that frears ' message simply can ' t be ignored or overseen
. the other members of the cast do an equally remarkable job
. both
_
_
_
_
_
_
and jack black are fabulous
. even catherine zeta jones appears in a role where she actually acts
, not just looks beautiful
.
however
, the most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided by todd louiso who delivers a spectacular comic performance as rob ' s co
- worker
and friend dick
. this is such an impressive achievement that it ' s almost worth a oscar
- nomination
. he is simpley a joy to behold
. otherwise
, everyone are in their palce
,
anbd at the right time
-
- all part ofthe frears ' colorful blend
. pretty much like edward norton ' s
" keeping the faith
"
, this film doesn ' t follow any formula or belong to any genre
-
- it ' s dramatic
, tragic
, sarcastic
, comic
and even cynical
,
bu never bitter or angry
. it ' s a little bit of everything
, pretty much like life itself
. nothing seems unreal or staged
. it reflects reality as a mirror
. as you watch it
, yuo go thru the same emotional problems as the main charachter
. you feel
annd think
and reflect
. this effect has become a rarity nowadays
.
although it ' s primarily about the perils of love
,
`
` high fidelity ' ' is secondarily about pop music
. rob owns championship vinyl
and his employees
, timid dick
( todd louiso
)
and overbearing barry
( jack black
)
, are fellow music snobs
. music is the language in theri lives
, thte mesure by which they define themselves
and mark the significant events of their lives
.
and so does yhe movie
. it is as much a musical film as anything else
, as rob ' s journey is wonderfully portrayed through carefully inserted musical fragments
. iin the end
, you have gained something while watching it
. it ' s not the film of the century or even of the year
. it ' s not an special effects extravaganza
. it doesn ' t recquire big explosions or digital creatures to succeed
. it ' s a small movei about the big things
.
adn even
though it does not contain hevy philosophy
, you feel as if you have experienced something of significance
,
and you will experience that nice warm feeling fo quite some time
.
