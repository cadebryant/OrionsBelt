htere exists a litany of differences between a succesful acation movie
and a successful suspense movei
. acation movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences
, while suspense movies hinge on plot
and subtlety
and the abillity to bring everything full
- circle
. for fans of both genres
,
however
, realism is key
. action fans want tothe know that the weapons
and methods their heroes are using are au
thentic
,
and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie
' s end
. on this advice
, director john frankenheimer
( the isl
and of dr
. moreau
) strives forthe realism infact an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense annd action for his latest thriller
, ronin
. the depth of intrigue in ronin is qtuie amazing
, considering the fare that
' s fallen into the same category over the last few years
. the script
, writed by j
. d
. zeik in his big
- screen de
but
, approaches levels of complexity tath hadnt people spinning away from mission
: impossible two years ago
. a certain number of people will be lost by this
,
but afficianados will appreciate it all the more
and return mutiple times
. frankenheimer masters the script with poise
,
and tells us a dark
but stoically realistic tale of a group of post
- cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck
. his ability to convey feeling
and character while promoting explosiveness
and tense atmosphere works well here
,
and ronin becomes a better movie because of it
. robert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outst
anding of his in quite some time
. he takes comm
and
and offers much gravity as the ex
- spy sam
, a man who
' s called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre
( natascha mcelhone
) recover a package
. the package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast
, especially once the requisite double
- crossing begins
,
and its role is skillfully penned by zeik
. at times
,
however
, zeik
' s tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission
: impossible
- de niro might easily become tom cruise
, the package might become cruise
' s cmoputer disk
. fortunately
, the focus here is alomst entirely on the package
, whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the double
- cross
and why it hapened
. the action content is impressive
, adn it lives up to the hints given in previews
. the only fans who iwll be disappointed are those who expect full
- blown combat scenes
and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness
. ronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of teh nsuance from start tothe finish
,
but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most charachters m
and subplots
. the suspense tapers off considerably by the end
, a bit of a drawback because of its height at the movie
' s open
. considering these factors it
' s good tothe see tyhat ronin was a project that turned out well
,
and it
' s another ogod bet this month
. since quality is usually sparse during tyhe early fall months
, it
' s definitely worth the visit
.
