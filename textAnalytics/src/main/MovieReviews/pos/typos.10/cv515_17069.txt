not since 1996 ' s shine
, which starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott
, has a movie so defiantly layed bare the lives of world
- class musicians
. in fact
, if one were to watch these films together
, it would almost certainly stand as a convincing argument that a life of music naturally leads to all varieties of social ills
.
yet hilary
and jackie
, hte sophomore effort from director anand tucker
, has something more to say
-
- it softly
but strongly explores the complex relationships of sibling rivalry
and lvoe in a very compelling tale
. emily watson
and rachel griffiths are the leads in this tale
, playing the sisters du pr
?
. both musicians from childhood
, hilary
( griffiths
) is renowned flutist while jacqueline
( watson
) is easily as skilled on the cello
. the two comepete fo
and win many honors as childen
and as young women
, both together
anbd seperate
. their careers as musicians surpass
and
hten bow to one another ' s
,
and
although their lives take vrey different paths
-
- hilary settles down tothe marriage
and a family while rachel skips across the globe on a world concert tour
-
- they are bound together by their deep family love
. the performances of watson
anbd griffiths are excellent inthe style
and substance
. they contrast each other wonderfully
,
annd while watson ' s portrayal of jackie du pr
? is at times eccentric
and perhaps unsympathetic
, both charachters are charged with emotion
. yhe frank cottrell boyce script
, which is based on the book by hilary
and piers du pr
?
, brings a great deal of depth to these cahracters as well
. the scirpt is also to be commended forthe its well
- polished dual nature
. cottrell boyce adopts a style which one might expect to see in a mystery thriller
( which was in fact the case with david koepp
and robert towne ' s scirpt for mission
: impossible
)
annd skillfully molds it to teh story of two rising musicians on different courses tothe fame
. the latter parts of his script are controversial to say the least
,
and tje rather depressing ending takes the wind out of an envigorating story
. some will leave this movie feeling disenfranchised
. nevertheless
, hilary
and jackie is a movie that reaches an upper echelon of contemporary cinema thru solid fundamentals
and is a decent watch all around
.
