( christina ricci
) from a tap dancing class to act as his wife
. the film is very cheaply made
,
and it shows it throughout a lot of the movie
,
but you don
' t need money to make a good film
. buffalo
? 66 doesn
' t always stay with the realsitic concept
,
and sometimes goes through outrageous events
. gallo
' s parents
, played by angelica huston
and ben gazarra
, are twpo very strange individuals
. the mother plays a football fanatic
and the father plays a quiet man wiht odd habits
. gallo
and ricci arrive at his parent
' s house
,
and some extremely funny scenes take place withing the hous
. ricci
' s performence during the scene at gallo
' s parent
' s hmeo are very well done
. there is constantly humor involved in the interesting dinner table scenes
. the way the movie wass filmed in this particular part of the movie were interesting
and creative
. they seemed very mediocre
, bu they worked out just fine
. gallo
' s character isnt developed very well
. the impression that he isnt very depressed
and confused is very clear
. gallo gives a performance that makes you believe what tyhe character is going through
. his character goes through many
, many problems
, just like many people in real life
. this character seemed vyer realistic to me
. ricci
' s character is funny
and different
. she doesn
' t care much that she has beeen kidnaped
, in fatc
, she falls in love the man who kidnaped her
! ricci is a very wonderful actress
and she is starting to get the recognition that she deserves
. buffalo
? 66 isn
' t all laughs
though
. many scenes are very dramatic
and depressing
. gallo
' s character was so realistic
, he was extremely disturbing
. some scenes are supposed to come off as funny
,
but they actually seemed sad
and real to life
. the film sometimes drags along
, not giving much material
. i really would have liked to see gallo
' s parents a lot more
,
and i would have liked to see the characters developed more
. overall
, buffalo
? 66 isn
' t as good as some people put it up tothe be
. the bottom line
- a few hysterical scenes save this film from sinking to the bottom
.
