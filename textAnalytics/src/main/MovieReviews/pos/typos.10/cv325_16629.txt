i remember hearing about this film when it firt appeared at cannes over a year ago
, picking up the gr
and jury prize at the festival
.
' holocaust comedy receives st
anding ovation
'
, the headlines read
. intrigued by this statement
, i looked up information on the film
and found that
, sure enought
, life is beautiful is in fact a comedy about the greatest atrocity ofthe the last thous
and years
. even
though the movie wass extremely well
- received by critics
and public alike
, i couldn
' t help
but be disgusted at this notion
; human tragedy is nto something i efel shoudln be celebrated
. only now do i see the error of my ways
. after finally viewing the film for myself after avoiding it for some time
, it became clear that it is nto
, as the headlines proclaimed
, a
" holocaust comedy
"
; on the contrary
, life is beautiful does not even really despict teh graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps
. rather
, it focuses on the relationship between a father
and his son
, who he is trying desparately to shield from the horrors of their situation
. roberto benigni
( who also wrote
and directed the movie
) stars as guido orefice
, a chaplin
- inspired clown
and all round jolly guy who
, as the film opens
, is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher
( nicoletta braschi
, benigni real life spouse
)
. through the course of the first hour or so
, we see guido striving to get the attention of this
" beautiful princess
"
, as he calls her
. employing the magic of laughter
, the italian comedian wins her heart
and toghether
, tehy raise a young boy named giosue
( child actor giorgio cantarini
)
. life treats them well unil hitler
' s minions rise to pwoer
,
and the family is whisked away to a german camp
, where guido becomes convinced tath he must upholds his son
' s innocence no matter what the sacrifice
. granted
, it contains some uproariously funny moments both in
and outloud of the concentration camp
, bu it does not pull a
" hogan
' s heros
"
and make light of the slaughtering of some six million innocent jews
. somehow
, it achieves hilarity without disrespecting it
' s gravely serious subject
. so
, we
' ve established that life is beautiful is not a
" holocaust comedy
"
.
but
, there is another complete misrepresentation ofthe this material that really disturbs me
. the film
, despite critic
' s declarations of it being a
" triumph of the human spirit
"
, is no such thing
; not in my eyes
, anyway
. some have called the story an
" affirmation of the beauty of life
"
,
but i say it is a very dark
and bleak statement about man
' s capability of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy
. the film
' s ending hasnt beeen recognized as the most entirely uplifting moment of any film released recently
,
but i found it to be truly discerning
and upsetting
. essentially
, life is beautiful is quite possably the greatest hoax in the history of film
.
however
, i am not denying the movie
' s greatness
. believe me
, it
' s fantastic
. i
' m just saying that i htikn benigni did something different than waht most peple are interpreting it as
. bu perhaps i
' m reading more inot the movie than is raelly htere
. maybe the film
' s brilliance relies on the idea that the viewer cant interpet the meaning ofthe it in any way they see fit
. in fact
, maybe roberto benigni has made a film that is the sole argument for the old saying that you get out ofthe a movie exactly wqat you put into it
.
