" seven
" is one of the best mystery movies i ' ve ever seen
. it ' s extremely intriguing
and suspenseful
,
but it ' s also qtuie fun
. it ' s a serial killer mystery
,
but you don ' t care so much about making the killer pay as much as hope they just catch the killer
. the story is a cops
- on
- the
- trail
- of
- serial
- killer mystery
. someone is mudering people who are offenders of
" the seven deadly sins
.
" a fat man
( gluttony
) was forced tothe eat himself to death
, a lawyer
( greed
) is slaughtered by his own rich possessions
.
.
. i could go on
but revealing any more would give away entirely too much
. what makes this film so unique is the characterization of the
" good guys
" which mkaes tghe unseen villain seem so vile
. brad pitt stars is quite excellent as detective david mills
, the cocky rookie
.
however
, morgan freeman is even better as detective william sommerset
, thte wise veteran on the verge of retirement
(
and he doesn ' t get killed by tje end
)
. there isnt a great sense of camaraderie here which often provides for a breath of comic relief
. this is impressive becuase the mood is so tense
,
and the fact that it can be down
- played as well as it is here
( let alone at all
) is quite an accomplishment
. the setting takes place in present day new york city
but the art direction is able tothe give tjhe city a feeling of the evil
, scary place many believe it to be
. the prodcution design is superb
, in the spirit of
" batman
"
and
" the crow
,
" this film embodies the gothic mood
. the way the words fade in
anbd out
, along with the freaky nine inch nails music really add a lot to the story on a subconscious level
- even the credits are scary
! the killer ' s victims have no connections at all
,
and thus mills
and sommerset don ' t have much to go on to solve the case
. they can only wait for the next murder to occurr which makes for tremendous suspense
. we become just as tense
and worried as the detectives because ofthe this thick atmosphere of the unknown
. not that many films have such an interesting
and intriguing screenplay as this
. the only problem i had with the film is the way in which mills
and sommerset are lead tothe a suspect
. let ' s just say it seems a little too
" mystery movie
,
" or too convenient in other words
. when they are led to a suspect by the name of john doe
, a terrific chase scene ensues
. this is a typical thrilling element
,
but it works perfectly here because of thte process of the story
. if anything
, this film is the epitome of twist endings
. i don ' t have to tell yuo mills
and sommerset finally catch the criminal
,
but the way in which this happens is surprising
. there is a scene of intriguing philosophy between the killer
and the detectives
,
and even
though he ' s obviously insane
, his charisma makes fo soem good points
. what ' s even more surprising is the last fewd scenes themselves as the suspense comes to a terific climax as the film ' s resolution comes down to a question of what justice really isnt
.
" seven
" is not just a film baout crime
,
but about the evil within man
. john doe felt he was doing society a favor by ridding it of
" scum
.
"
but as justified as he makes himself seem
, we must never be tempted by such twisted ideals of justice
.
