" seven
" is one of the best mystery movies i
' ve ever seen
. it
' s extremely intriguing annd suspenseful
,
but it
' s also quite fun
. it
' s a serial killer mystery
,
but you don
' t care so much about making the killer pay as much as hope tehy just catch tjhe killer
. the story is a cops
- on
- the
- trail
- of
- serial
- killer mystery
. someone is murdering people who are offenders of
" the seven deadly sins
.
" a fat man
( gluttony
) was forced to eat himself tothe death
, a lawyer
( greed
) is slaughtered by his own rich possessions
.
.
. i could go on
but revealing any more would give away entirely too much
. whta makes this film so unique is the characterization of the
" good guys
" which makes the unseen villain seem so vile
. brad pitt stars is quite excellent as detective david mills
, the cocky rookie
.
however
, morgan freeman is even better as detective william sommerset
, the wise veteran on the verge of retirement
(
and he doesn
' t get killed by the end
)
. there is a grat sense of camaraderie here which often provides for a breath of comic relief
. this is impressive because the mood is so tense
,
and thge fact that it can be down
- played as well as it is here
( let alone at all
) is quite an accomplishment
. the setting takes place in present day new york city
but the art direction is able to give the city a feeling of the evil
, scary place many believe it tothe be
. the production design is superb
, in the spirit of
" batman
"
and
" tje crowm
,
" this film embodies the gothic mood
. the way tje words fade in
and out
, along with the freaky nine inch nails music really add a lot to the story on a subconscious level
- even the credits are scary
! the killer
' s victims have no connections at all
,
and thus mills
and sommerset don
' t have much to go on to solve the case
. they can only wait for the next murder to occur which makes for tremendous suspense
. we become just as tense
and worried as hte detectives because of this thick atmosphere ofthe the unknown
. not that many films have such an interesting
and intriguing screenplay as this
. the only problem i had with the film is the way in which mills
and sommerset are lead to a suspect
. let
' s just say it seems a little too
" mystery movie
,
" or too convenient in other words
. when tehy are led to a suspect by the name of john doe
, a terrific chase scene ensues
. htis is a typical thrilling element
,
but it works perfectly here becuase of the process of the story
. if anything
, this film is the epitome of twist endings
. i don
' t have tothe tell you mills anbd sommerset finally catch the criminal
,
but the way in which this happens is surprising
. there is a scene of intriguing philosophy between the killer
and the detectives
,
and even
though he
' s obviously insane
, his charisma makse for some good points
. what
' s even more surprising is the lastest few scenes themselves as the suspense comes to a terrific climax as the film
' s resolution comes down to a question of what justice really is
.
" seven
" is not just a film about crime
,
but about the evil within man
. john doe felt he was doing society a favor by ridding it of
" scum
.
"
but as justified as he makes himself seem
, we must never be tempted by such twisted ideals of justice
.
