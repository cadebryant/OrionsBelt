my fellow americans is a movei that at first glance looks to have little substance
( or a movie that we ' ve all seen a million times
)
, two liftime rivals thrown together
and
then thge fun begins
. this isnt exactlly what happened in this movie
,
but fortunately
, they managed to do it in an interesting
and funny way
. the movie starts with a quick
(
and i do mean quick
) glance of two presidents russell kramer
( jack lemmon
)
and matt douglas
( james garner
)
. william haney
( dan aykroyd
)
and ted matthews
( john heard
) are the new president
and vice president
. there is a scandal that arises involving a kickback from a contractor
and haney isnt positive that he buried that years ago
. he finds a scapegoat inspite kramer
and now everyone wants kramer
and douglas dead
. this movie was exceptional for many reasons
. one being that tehy found people
( lemmon
and garner
) that have good chemisty together
. they worked very well as a unit
and they mirrored each other perfectly
, oen bieng a ladies man
and one being teh old man
( i ' ll let you fiqure which is whlch
)
. also
, they found people that know their parts as govenment officials well
. it seemed to me that garner played almost exactly the same role that he played in the distinquished gentleman
( except
then he was a congressman
)
. experience counts for a lot
