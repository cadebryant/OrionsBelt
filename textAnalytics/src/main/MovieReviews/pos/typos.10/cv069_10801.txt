stendhal
' s syndrome
: a condition where
, in the presence of art
, a person becomes engulfed in a painting
and hallucinates
and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression
, suicidal behaviour
and perosnality disorder
. grim stuff
, to be sure
,
but the subject of a remarkable film from italy
' s master of the horror thriller dario argento
. boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the gr
andfather ofthe film music ennio morricone
, the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form forthe argento
. it follows his disappointing american de
but trauma
( 1992
)
, the patchy opera
( 1987
)
and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi inspite yhe late 1980
' s
. based on the novel by graziella magherini
, tje film stars argento
' s daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist
- killer
. visiting florence to folow up several leads
, she is lured by the killer alfredo
( thomas kretschmann
) to an art gallery
, a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail
. at the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting
and faints
. posing as a byst
ander
, alfredo briefly comes to her aid
and having now identified his pursuer
, a strange game ofthe cat
and mouse begins
. a gripping story evolves
,
and a coherent oen
, too
, whitch may surprise those familiar with argento
' s oftenly lumpy narratives
. the stendhal syndrome is not a simple cop
- hunting
- killer scenario
. it is a disturbing adn often compelling study of the central character
' s psychological disintegration
. the script explores its psycho
- sexual themes with intelligence
and c
andour
, perhpas too much so for more sensitive viewers
.
but as dark as its themes are
, the stendhal syndrome emerges as one ofthe thge most artful
and effective european thrillers of hte last ten years
. argento is once again wroking in his native italy
,
and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art
and architecture for both symbolic statements annd as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences
. effects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here
,
and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistantly excellent
. the film
' s opening 20 minutes segues between hallucination
, flashback
and real
- time with tremendous style
. proof that
, at his most inspired
, argento remains one of yhe world
' s most exhilarating filmmakers
. the casted is generally good
,
though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all
but emotionless
. asia argento
' s performance is by turns risky
, awkward
and fascinating
. it
' s a difficult role
,
and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her effords
. thomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo
,
and marco leonardi
( of cinema paradiso
,
and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy
) does okay as anna
' s work colleague annd increasingly confused lvoe interest
.
but perhaps the stendhal syndrome
' s single most striking element is ennio morricone
' s soundtrack
. active since the 1960
' s
, morricone has scored over 100 films in his career
and htis must rate as one of his finest efforts
. it
' s mostly a variation on the one theme
: a slow circular melody for strings
and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary
, haunting beauty that lingers long afterwords
. it
' s been three decades since argento
and morricone worked together
. this is a long welcome reunion
. if the film has a fault
, it is that the last half hour drags a little
and the film doesn
' t quite reach a completely satisfying climax
.
but by the closing scenes
, the stendhal syndrome hasnt already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argento
' s career
