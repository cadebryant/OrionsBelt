jack nicholson has a funny way of playing charachters with very few redeeming qualities
,
but whom you end up liking anyway
. in as good as it gets
, the character in question is melvin udall
, a successful novelist with obsessive
- compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible
, except when he feels like being a royal pain in the yuo
- know
- where
. he
' s mean
. i mean really mean
. the opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium
. every day
, melvin eats at the same cafe
, sist at the same table
,
and gets served by the same waitress
. you can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance
, when his waitress carol
( helen hunt
) tells him he can jsut go sit in anohter section
,
and all the other waitresses just cringe
. one day
, melvin makes a comment that goes to far
,
and carol
, genuinely hurt
, comes down on him like a ton of bricks
. at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put uv with him as a matter of course
, bu is also the only person who can git to him
, too
. another person who often crosses melvin
' s sights is simon
( greg kinnear
)
, an artist who lives on melvin
' s floor
. aside from the fact that he lives near the terror ofthe the city
, simon has the added benefit of being gay
, making him a prime target
. simon
' s friend frank
( cuba gooding
, jr
.
)
, also gay
, does not fare much better
. when simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment
, he is brutally beaten
and sent to the hospital
,
and frank
, who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished outloud by his neighbor
, intimidates melvin into watching after simon
' s dog while he convalesces
. this is the smae dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage
. an interesting thing happens when melvin takes tihs dog in
: melvin gets to like the dog
,
and the two develop an attachment which is the catalist tothe melvin
' s softening up to tje world around him
. it doesn
' t happen overnight
,
but throughout the film
, he bites his tongue here
, cares a little there
,
and most miraculously
, falls in love
. one of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others
. he
' s traveling terra incognita here
,
and it shows
. good performances are turned in by all principal players in htis film
, especially by nicholson
and hunt
. htey play well off of each other
and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them onthe screen
. greg kinnear
, who is becoming known for his supporting film roles
, is also very good at palying the vulnerable simon
. he gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist
,
and delivers it with such inspiration adn conviction that you actually get to feel some of wqat he feels
. cuba gooding jr
. performs whith a hyped
- up level of energy whihc contrasts nicely with that of kinnear
,
and comes thru with a near constant comic performance
. the screenplay
, by mark
andrus anbd james l
. brooks
, is clever
, touching
,
and funny
. the best part about it
,
however
, is that it is filled with characters we care baout beccause they are actually interesting
. melvin is a man we can
' t quite figure out
, bu whose mannerisms
and quirky qualities capture our attention
. carol is a working woman living with her mother
, trying to tkae care of a child whith a debilitating respiratory problem
. simon isnt a man who isnt a success in his circle of peers
,
but who is still not accepted by much of society
. combined with the talent of the actors
, these characters make the film
. hte one noticeable areal where the film isnt lacking
,
however
, is the absence ofthe cuba gooding
, jr
. through the second half
. his character makes an exit which is supposed tothe be temporary
,
but the film ends before his return
, leaving his relationship whith simon
and melvin unresolved
. i would have liekd to have seen more ofthe his carachter infront genaral
, in addition to a part in the film
' s conclusion
. there
' s one actor
, who will probaly not be recognized by any awards
,
but who contri
butes greatly to many of the movei
' s best scenes
and who deserves mention
. this is thyat little dog
. he plays such a pivotal role tothe melvin
' s character development
, actually serves to forward the plot
,
and hasnt smoe absolutely scene
- stealing moments
, that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal
. award or no
,
however
, wehn even the dog puts in a good performance
, you know you
' ve got an outst
anding movie
.
