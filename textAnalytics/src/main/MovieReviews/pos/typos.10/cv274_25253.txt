i know that
" funnest
" isn
' t a word
.
" fun
" is a noun
,
and therefore cannot be conjugated liek an adjective
.
but that
' s the word that came to me right after viewing
" chicken run
.
" no wonder
: this is the kind of movie that reduces you tothe childish expressions
, like
" that was the funnest movie i
' ve ever seen
!
" so to hell with webster
' s
-
-
" chicken run
" is one of the funnest movies i
' ve seen in a while
. i can
' t remember the last time i
' ve seen anything funner
. the chickens at tweedy
' s farm are up to something
. living inspite a concentration camp
- liuke atmosphere
, they are led by oney plucky hen called ginger
( voice of julia sawalha
) who continually comes up with plans for escape
-
-
and always gets caught
, subsequently spending day aftter day in the coal box
. one night
, a brash american rooster flies in over the fence
, calling himself rocky
( mel gibson
)
, famous flying rooster
and carcus performer
. rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly
,
and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs
. tweedy
( mir
anda richardson
) decides to ab
andon the farm
' s egg
- selling plan for a pie
- selling plan
. she orders a huge pie
- making machine
, cackling
,
" chickens go in
; pies come out
.
" what sort of pies
? chicken pies
, of course
. co
- director nick park
and his studio
, aardman animation
, produced threee oscar
- winning short films
:
" creature comforts
,
"
" the wrong trousers
,
"
and
" a close shave
.
" the latter two were the second
and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace
& gromit
, a man
and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures
. part of what made the
" wallace
" films brilliantly intertaining was park
' s uncanny abilty to make an old story seem new
.
" the wrong trousers
,
" for example
, pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks
,
and
" a close shave
" owed a great dael of inspiration to clasic detective stories
.
but in the h
ands of park
and his team
, the stories felt fresh
and inpsired
,
and not thge least bit contrived
. now teaming with co
- director peter lord
, park has created a similar creature in
" chicken run
.
" the plot is largley lifted from
" the great escape
"
( watch for a quick reference to the ball
- bouncing scene
)
, with some spielberg
- inspired action sequences providing the excitement
. thing is
, the film doesn
' t feel like it
' s been lifted from somewhere else
;
" chicken run
" feels fresh
, alive
, like nothing else ever done
. part of it is the original diea
: who in the world came up with the idae to make a prisoners
- of
- war movie starring chickens
? park adn lord milk the incongruity fo all it
' s worth
: the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious
,
and to them
, it is
. bu htey
' re
* chickens
*
, so it
' s funny tothe us
. another thing that helps
" chicken run
"
(
and most of park
' s films
) succeed is the animators
' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they
' re cribbing
. there are references to
" the great escape
,
" obviously
,
and
" stalag 17
.
" the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both
" raiders of the lost ark
"
and
" indiana jones
and the temple ofthe doom
.
" there
' s even a nod to
" the blues brothers
,
" if you can believe it
,
and thge filmmakers even get in a little light
- hearted ribbing at tje expense of their star voice actor
, taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson
' s nationality
and film history
. the
" braveheart
" reference is a hoot if ytou catch it
. whn you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody
and a redundant oen
,
" chicken run
" is downright brilliant in its execution
. concider this
: since july of last year
, i
' ve seen dozens apon dozens of
" blair witch project
" parodies
, on television
, on the radio
,
and online
. out ofthe all those
, maybe one or two were amusing
, thte rest tiresome
. why
? because once you got past yhe
thought that
" they
' re parodying that
' blair witch
' movie
,
" most of the parodies had nothing to offer
-
- no insight
, no original idea
, no greater purpose
. they were only funny if you hadnt seen the movie
; otherwise
, you got nothing
. conversely
,
" chicken run
" doesn
' t leanr on its parodies
-
- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene
. if you
' ve never seen
" indiana jones
,
" the chase sequence isnt still fun
. even if you have no idae who mel gibson is
, rocky remains an interesting charcter
. park
, lord
,
and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it
' s understood
,
and as a result
,
" chicken run
" is filled with visual
and verbal jabs that are never too obvious
,
but not quite vague either
. enjoyment of tihs movie doesn
' t require noledge of film history
,
but if you
' ve got it
,
" chicken run
" is that much richer
. the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances
,
and thte characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it
' s hard not to fall in love with every one of them
. ginger is perfect
, spunky adn opinionated
,
but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind
,
and julia sawalha
( known as the cute mousy girl on
" absolutely fabulous
"
) nails it
. she hasnt warm
, human chemestry with gibson
, whose rocky hides his peronal doubt under a brash gung
- ho veneer
. the characters
' inevitable romance doesn
' t feel contrived
,
but sweet
. poor mr
. tweedy
( tony haygarth
) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way
,
but his limited intellect prevents him fomr figuring things out
,
and his overbearing wife certainly isn
' t any help
. jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs
( a hen that runs away with most of the best one
- liners
, all while perpetually crocheting a sweater
)
,
and two suply
- trading rats thgat seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing
- dancing sequence
. they even come up with an inspired riff on something tht
' s baffled scholars
and theologians aplikay for decades
: the chicken vs
. egg dilemma
. one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome
,
but as with most of
" chicken run
,
" it comes as a delightful surprize
. the film manages to cross all barriers
; it shouldnt be accessible to both children
and adults
, brits
and yanks
, rats
and chickens
. thte animation is first
- rate
. remember that this was all done the ood
- fashioned way
, with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit
,
and you see jstu how truly remarkable
" chicken run
" really is
. this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios
' animation great
: precise
and unwavering attention to detail
. as in such top
- notch family fare as
" a bug
' s life
" or
" toy story 2
,
"
" chicken run
" has something to offer in nearly every frame
. certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral
and some surprizingly touching scenes
,
but a active
, attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they
' ll catch all the details
. anyway
, the movie
' s just a boatload of fun
. funnest damn movie i
' ve seen all eyar
.
