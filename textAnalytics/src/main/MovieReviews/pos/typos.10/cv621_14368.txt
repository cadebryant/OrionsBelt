ever wonder what happened tothe gabe kaplan
? you remember
, he was the title character in that 70 ' s sitcom
,
" welcome bcak kotter
.
" always trying to halp out the sweathogs
, frequently trying to dodge mr
. woodman
, ever wary of his wife ' s tuna casserole
.
" so
,
" you ask
,
" where is he now
?
" mr
. kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional high
- stakes poker
. that ' s right
. i ' m not sure if it ' s his main source of income
,
but from what i ' ve heard
, the guy occasionally comes away with
$ 20
, 000 at a time
.
and there you weere
, thinking i was going to tell you he was doing off
- broadway theater
. you silly goose
. well
, gabe kaplan isn ' t in the movie rounders
, nor is the film about the acto come gambler ' s life
.
bu rounders is about poker
,
and gabe plays poker
,
and i thought that was kind of a neat connection
. sorry about the segue
, or lack thereof
. matt damon plays mike mcdermott
, a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker
. he ' s been playing fo a while
,
and more than being proficient
, he has caught the bug
. he goes to all the underground ganes in newyorker york city
, knows the regulars
,
and konws how to win
. infact the beginning of the film
, he ' s built up a nice thirty grand nest egg
, which he takes to the speakeasy
- type gaming parlor where the big boys play
. mike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb
( john malkovich
)
, an oreo
- munching cardshark with ties to the russian masia
. mike has the potential to take a large pot
and go to vegas
and buy into the world serieses of poker
,
but instead he loses it all in a single hand
. months later
, he ' s paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck
. when mike ' s best friend
and poker buddy worm
( edward norton
) finishes his jail term for hustling some students
, he wants to pick up right were they left off
, working as a team to part others with their betting cash
.
although mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend
and fellow law student
, jo
( gretchen mol
)
, worm connives mike into playing once more
,
and mike
, bitten again by the bug
, slides down that slippery slope
, risking his relationship
, education
,
and reputation as palying poker agian becomes the focus ofthe his life
. tothe make a film about gambling
, a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters
. this is because few moviegoers will care a wohle lot about some guy in a leiure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table withthe a stogie in his mouth
. rounders
,
however
, seems tothe go more for the latter than the former
. the card clubs mike
annd worm frequent aren ' t very glamorous at all
. there ' s a basement
, a lodge with elk heads on the wall
, a goulash joint
- these are the kinds of locales in whihc director john dahl sets his shots
. exept for one brief instatance when the two players visit atlantic city
, the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table
. the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy
and are slaves to it
. we ' re given a nice set of intresting characters with clear motivations
,
and good actors to play them
. matt damon is very natural as mike
, who struggles between his desire to play the straight
and narrow by finishing law school
,
and answering what may be his true calling
, playing professional poker
. ed norton ' s worm is truly a worm
, always looking for the angle
anbd playing everyone for what they ' re worth
. john turturro
, who amazes me with his acting range
, tones it down in this film by playing joey knish
, a virtual poker prodigy in his tyme who now plays the undreground games to make rent
and child support payments
. he ' s both a friend
and mentor to mike
,
and turturro ' s low
- key performance is totally convincing
, just as john malkovich ' s heavily
- accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself
. martin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike ' s law professors
, abe petrovsky
. while landau slips well into the role
, his charachter
, spitting out peronal anecdotes about staying true to one ' s self
, facilitates the channeling of the storyline towrad a predictable ending
. perhaps the weak link in tjhe otherwise formidable line
- up of acting talent
,
howver
, is gretchen mol who just didn ' t seem to have much presence on screen
. she ' s a genuine peach to look at
, kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger
and singer jewel
(
and i wouldn ' t be surprised if thte three of them formed smoe kind of blond
- haired triumvirate
and attempted to take over the world
)
,
bu her delivered lines seemed very flat
,
and i found myself looking for matt damon ' s reactions instead
. a good hting baout rounders isnt that it doesn ' t get bogged down in the charater development
and statment making so much that it can ' t find tiem for humor
. the film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make ytou laugh
and keep the pacing going
, such as a sequence where mike
and worm move rapidly around new york fomr one game to the next
, in widely different locales
. one game in a cigar club had me in stitches
.
" i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper
,
" says one of the players
, clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other
. i wass hoping mike
and worm woudl really take these guys
. witht all the poker being played
, rounders had the potential to be vrey confusing
. you might think you knwo a lot about poker
,
but think again
. luckily
, we ' re given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what ' s going onthe
. the narrations are more informative than intrusive
,
adn apprise us of waht the stakes are
and why certain players want to dont the things they do
. it ' s nice that as the characters develop
, so does our comprehension of their world
. as a film baout succes
and survival in the realm of underground poker
, rounders delivers in spades
. wait
! as a film about the culture of cards
, rounders is an ace
. hang on
! packed with great acting
and great characters
, rounders is a full house
. okay
, i guess that ' s enough
. oh
, by the way
, if you ever want to get into a game with ol ' gabe kaplan
, be sure to bring a note from epstein ' s mother
.
