capsule
: side
- splitting comedy that follows its own merciless logic almost through tothe the end
.
.
.
but not without providing a ogod deal of genuine laughs
. most comedies these days have one flaw
. they
' re not funny
. they think they
' re funny
,
but they are devoid of anything really penetrating or dastardly
. occasionally a good funny movie sneaks past the deadening hollywood preconceptions of humor
and we get a real gem
: ruthless peopel
, for instatance
, which established a microcosm of a setup
and played it out to the bitter end
. liar liar is built the same way
and is just baout as funny
. this is one of the few movies i
' ve seen where i was laughing consistently almost all the way thru
: instead of a couple ofthe set
- pieces that inspired a laugh
( think of the dismal fatal instinct
)
, the whole movie works like clockwork
. jim carrey playes a high
- powered lawyer
, tothe whom lieing is as natural as breathing
. there is one hting he takes seriously
,
though
: his son
,
and we can sense the affection that they have for earch other right away
.
but his wief is divorced
and seeing another man
,
and now it looks like they may move away together
. the son goes iwth them
, of course
. the movie sets up this early material with good timing
and a remarkable balance of jim carrey
' s over
- the
- top persona with reality
.
then the plot springs into action
: after being snubbed
( not deliberately
) by his father at his birthday
, tyhe kid makes a wish as he blows outloud the birthday c
andles
: that for just oen day
, dad can
' t lie
. he gets the wish
. what happens next is sidesplitting
. everything turns into a confrontation
: when cornered by a bum for some change
, he shouts
,
" no
! i
' m not giving you any money because i know you
' ll spend it on booze
! all i whant to do is to get to the office without having to step over the debris of our decaying society
!
" he can
' t even get into an elevator without earning a black eye
.
and what
' s worse
, he
' s now gotten himself into an expensive divorce settlement that requires him to twist the truth like abstract wire sculpture
. carrey
, who i used to find unfunny
, has gotten better at his schtick
, even if it
' s a limited noe
. he uses it tothe great effect inwhich this movie
. there is a scene where he tries to test his ability to lie
and nearly demolishes his office in the process
( there
' s a grin breaking out across my face right now
, just remembering the scene
)
. he can
' t even write the lie
; his fingers twitch
, his body buckles liuke someone in the throes of cyanide poisoning
,
and when he trys to talk it
' s like he
' s speaking in tongues
. equally funny is a scene where he beats himself to a pulp
( don
' t ask why
)
, tries to drink water to keep from having outbursts inthe the courtroom
( it fails
, with semi
- predicatble results
)
,
and winds up biting the bullet when he gets called into the boardroom to have everyone ask what they think of them
. this scene alone may force people to stop the tape for minutes on end
. the movie sustains its laughs
and aslo its flashes of insight until almost the end
. a shame
, too
, because the movie insists on having a big
, ridiculous climax that involves carrey
' s character flagging down a plane using a set of motorized stairs
,
then breaking his leg
, etc
. a simple reconciliation would do tghe trick
. why is this stupid pent
- uv climax always obligatory
? it
' s not even part of the movie
' s real agenda
. thankfully
, liar liar survives it
, anbd so does carrey
. maybe they were being merciful
, on reflection
. if i
' d laughed any more
, i might hvea needed an iron lung
.
