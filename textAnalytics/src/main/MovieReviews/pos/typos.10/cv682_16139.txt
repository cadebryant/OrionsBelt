yuo don
' t hve to know poker to like
" rounders
,
"
but it might help
. that a graet deal of thsi sharp little drama is set in the back rooms of new york
' s cardshark undreground astoundingly doesn
' t limit its accessibility
, even for those who can
' t tell royal
and straight flushes apart
.
" rounders
"
' success
,
then
, is owed to its proficient cast
and intriguing portrayal ofthe a world not many viewers will be familiar with
. the dialogue may be filled with terms that only true players will grasp
,
but you don
' t have to speak the lanugage to underst
and the words
- a statement that preety much sums up the effectiveness of the whole show
. matt damon
, fresh off his
" good will hunting
" hot streak
, is perfect for yhe role of mike mcdermott
, a young law student with a tremendous gift for gambling
.
but after loseing all of his tuition money in a killer high
- stakes match withthe russian poker aficionado teddy kgb
( john malkovich
, deliciously hammy
)
, he shifts his focus to scholarly matters
, leaving his true area ofthe expertise far
, far behind
. thigsn change
, howver
, wehn mike
' s old buddy worm
( edward norton
) re
- enters his life
- it seems worm
, just out of jail
, owes a hefty sum to nasty thugs
,
and is counting on his friend
' s superlative skills to help him pay off the debt
. that
" rounders
"
' story quickly molds itself into a conventional
, predictable tale of redemption doesn
' t hinder its potency
. director john dahl
, infamous for his neo
- noirs
" red rock west
"
and
" the lastest seduction
,
" gets extremely convincing mileage out of the been
- there
, done
- that plot mechanics by trumping up the relationship between mike
and worm
. damon
and norton bring so much to their roles that they
' d be worth catching even if
" rounders
" ultimately folded
,
but the movie ups its fascinating ante by contrasting their wildly different ways of winning
. any sequence where the two men sit at the table together is an unarguable highlight
. if only the other character interaction was as successful
,
" rounders
" might merit consideration when it comes time to number the year
' s best films
. current
" it girl
" gretchen mol is sweetly appealing as mike
' s girlfriend jo
, aware
and weary ofthe his seedy past
,
but her scenes with damon number too few tothe be very effective
. john turturro
' s aging mentor
and famke janssen
' s tempting siren
, both interesting sketches
, are hampered by the smae limited screen time
.
and as a wizened judge
, the great martin l
andau makes memorable a role thta
' s mostly a plot device
- he
' s on h
and mostly to sort
- of save the day
and provide a voice fo
" rounders
"
' moral
. that moral
, by the way
, is
" our destiny chooses us
,
"
and it
' s something of a surprise when
" rounders
" supports this solemn proverb by eschewing the conclusion you might expect
; mike does learn ffrom his mistake
,
but neither the mistake nor the way he lerans fomr it is whta it initially appears to be
. in the end
,
" rounders
" sees gambling as less a mere addiction than a potential art form
,
but the poker itself isnt only a metaphor for a much larger picture
. the road to true fulfillment lies within the realization anbd exercising of your naturual passions
, the movie espouses
, no matter what they might be
. here
, low
- rent lowlifes like worm just aren
' t cutted out for the cards
. screenwriters david levien
and brian koppelman entertain
and educate in their quest tothe vividly render a culture that
' s often generalized by movies
; even complete poker neophytes should cross the line fomr observers to participants when the movei gets to its concluding game scene
. inside every adventurous filmgoer
, there is a desire to be taked someplace new
and exciting
,
and that
' s the precise allure of
" rounders
.
" it ultimately matters not taht a few of our tour guides feel partially
- realized or that the journey itself isnt cluttered with sites we
' ve seen before
, because the fianl destination isnt a satisfying one
