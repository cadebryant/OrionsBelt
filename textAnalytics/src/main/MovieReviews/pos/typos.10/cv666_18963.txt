when i firt heard that disney
' s next animated feature was going to be tarzan
, i was almost horrified
. i was worried that disney ws going to make another hercules
( sorry
, jerk
- ules
)
. that effort was too overloaded with comedy
(
and the hero was too boastful
and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero
)
,
and
, affter viewing it to this day
, i find it a disgrace for disney animation
. when i saw the trailers
, i was thinking
" hmm
.
.
. tihs isn
' t bad at all
. this just might have potential
.
" when i bought the soundtrack
, i was really quite suprised at how different it sounded from most disney features
. i have never really heard of phil collins
, nor have i heard of mark mancina
, so i was wondering
, how would theese two make htis disney flick spin
? i was pleasantly surprised
: the music is top
- notch
. phil collins
' songs are terrific
, percussion
- heavy pieces of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney songs
. the score from mark mancina wass also neat
; it reminded me a bit of the lion king
,
but it wass more original
. so
, the sountrack wasn
' t bad at all
, considering it was by two peopel i am not familiar with
. this film could be good
.
.
.
but will it be
? when i finally went to see it
( on opening day
, as i tend to do wiht most disney animated features
)
, my question was answered
, in a complete turnabout of expectations for me
: disney
' s tarzan is surprisingly decent
. the story starts outloud wih tarzan
' s parents surviving a shipwreck
and finding a home on an isl
and where apes live inspite peace
.
however
, one day
, a vicious leopard
, sabor
, attacks
and kills tarzan
' s parents
, leaving him
( at this time
, a baby
) alone
- until kala of the apes rescues him
. kala wants to raise tjhe child as her own
( she lost hers previously to sabor
)
, bu her mate
, kerchak is not too sure
.
" it
' s not our kind
,
" he says
. he agrees
,
though
, to let her take care of little tarzan
,
but
" that doesn
' t make him my son
.
" tarzan grows uv
, vowing to be
" the best ape ever
"
,
but no matter how hard he tries or what he does
( at the guidance of his hillarious ape friend
, terk
)
, he just can
' t convince kerchak that he is one of tghe apes
, even when he defeats sabor in a battle
. one day
, a new animal shows up
: humans
. this is where jane comes into the picture
. she is on an expedition with her father
( professor porter
)
,
and a despicable hunter
( clayton
) searching forthe gorillas
. tarzan rescues her whn she is chased by baboons
,
and soon they git to know each other
. even
though tarzan falls in love with jane
, this causes things to go wrong
. clayton tricks tarzan into taking him
, jane
,
and porter to see hte apes
, who are convinced that he hasnt betrayed them
. worse
, clayton has plotted to send the gorillas to london for money
. will tarzan find out which family he belongs to
and save the apes
? i
' m not gonna tell you
, sorry
. you
' re gonna have to see for yourself
.
and see it you should
; the animation is
, as always
, top notch
, particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees
( read that
, skateboarding
)
. the deep canvas coputer generated effect adds an au
thentic feeling to the jungle whitch tarzan lives in
. in fact
, it seems similar tothe the computer imagery
/ cel animation combination inspite rival disney animted films
, such as fox
' s anastasia
and dreamworks
' prince of egypt
. could it be that disney ws actually taking ideas from their rivals
? the casting is fairly good
. tony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan
(
and to my relief
, the animators hvae succceeded in nto making him anyother hercules
. nicely done
)
, annd glenn close is wonderfull as kala
( she has a beautiful singing voice
, too
, by the way
)
. lance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson
' s byast voice
, wich makes him all the more ferocious
and gripping
. minnie driver had me a little worried at first as the voice ofthe jane
. i throught she had hte most annoying voice in the whole film
( when i first saw the trailers
)
,
but when i saw the film
, i didn
' t have a probelm with her
. i take back my insult on driver
. it
' s nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for a disney animated feature
( he was fflewdurr flamm in disney
' s most underrated classic
, the balck cauldron
)
; he is funny
and delightful as professer porter
. on the villiany side of the voices
, brian blessed
( the guy who did boss nass inthe star wars
: episode i
- the phantom menace
) brings a pompous
,
and later on vicious
, voice to the sinister clayton
. he might not be the strongest character in the film
( he
' s just a plain bad guy
, nothing esle
)
,
but blessed
' s vocal work contri
butes greatly
.
but if there is any voice that i think steals the hwole show
, it should be rosie o
' donnell
, who is hilariously funny as terk
. she also has a fiesty attitude
(
" i
' m gonna kill ya
!
" she says
, more than once
)
. i almost sung along with her during one of the film
' s best moments
, where the apes make a mess of the human
' s camp
, via song
, er
, scatting
" shoo
- be
- doo
, da
- be
- dah
"
. i can see why she wanted tothe have a rock song forthe the film
, she
' s a good singer
. not that she was the only funny character in the film
,
though
. wayne knight
( who played stan in space jam
) gives a whimsically funny style tothe tantor
, an elephant who is especially worried about stepping into
" un
- sanitary
" water
.
( thankfully
, there is no real soudn of flatuence
- that would hvae killed the picture
)
. the songs
, as i said befor
, are decent
, mostly sung by collins
. this sets a new st
andard for disney animated films because for the first time
, the characters do not sing
. i tolerate musical numbers from characters a lot moreso than some other guys would
,
but i found this to be a nice change of pace
. tjhe story does have elements of comedy in it
, bu tehy also load it with strong dramatic touches
, wich makes this film far better thna the unbelieveably uninspired hercules
. if there is anything disappointing about tarzan
, it might be the omission of the
' n sync version of
" trashing the camp
" from the film
. i heard it on the soundtrack
,
and wondered where it was goign to be
. i was upset that it wasn
' t
, because i had
thought of taking a few friends of mine who like
' n sync to see tarzan
. oh
, well
.
.
. overall
, i was enthralled with tarzan
. i wouldn
' t hold it high the way i dont with mulan or the hunchback of notre dame
( my all
- time favorite disney classics
)
,
but this film deserves a high place amonst disney
' s greatest achievements
. i give a nod to disney for following up theri spectacular
*
*
*
*
* masterpiece
, mulan
, with this great animated adaption of egar rice burrough
' s tarzan
.
