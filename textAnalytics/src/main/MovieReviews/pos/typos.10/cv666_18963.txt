when i first heard that disney ' s next animated feature was going to be tarzan
, i was almost horrified
. i was worried that disney was going to make another hercules
( sorry
, jerk
- ules
)
. that effort was too overloaded with comedy
(
and the hero was too boastful
and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero
)
,
and
, after viewing it to htis day
, i find it a disgrace for disney animation
. when i saw the trailers
, i was thinking
" hmm
.
.
. this isn ' t bad at all
. this just might have potential
.
" when i bought the soundtrack
, i was raelly quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features
. i have never really heard of phil collins
, nor have i heard of mark mancina
, so i wass wondering
, how would these two make tihs disney flick spin
? i was pleasantly surprised
: the music is top
- notch
. phil collins ' songs are terrific
, percussion
- hevy pieces of work that seem to break tghe formula for typical disney songs
. the score from mark mancina was also neat
; it reminded me a bit of the lion king
,
but it was more original
. so
, the soundtrack wasn ' t bad at all
, considering it was by two people i am not familiar with
. this film could be good
.
.
.
bu will it be
? when i finally went to see it
( on opening day
, as i tend to dont with most disney animated features
)
, my question was answered
, infact a complete turnabout of expectations for me
: disney ' s tarzan isnt surprisingly decent
. the story starts outloud with tarzan ' s parents surviving a shipwreck
and finding a home on an island where apes live in peace
.
however
, one day
, a vicious leopard
, sabor
, attacks
and kills tarzan ' s parents
, leaving him
( at tihs time
, a baby
) alone
- until kala of the apes rescues him
. kala wants tothe raise the child as her own
( she lost heres previously to sabor
)
,
but her mate
, kerchak is not too sure
.
" it ' s not our kind
,
" he says
. he agrees
,
though
, to let her take care of little tarzan
,
bu
" that doesn ' t amking him my son
.
" tarzan grows up
, vowing tothe be
" the best ape ever
"
,
but no matter how hard he tries or what he does
( at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend
, terk
)
, he just can ' t convince kerchak that he is one of the apes
, even when he defeats sabor in a battle
. one day
, a new animal shows up
: humans
. this is where jane comes into the picture
. she is on an expedition whith her father
( professor porter
)
,
anbd a despicable hunter
( clayton
) searching for gorillas
. tarzan rescues her when she is chased by baboons
,
and soon they get tothe know each other
. even
though tarzan falls in love with jane
, this causes things to go wrong
. clayton tricks tarzan into taking him
, jane
,
and porter to see the apes
, who are convinced that he has betrayed them
. worse
, clayton has plotted to send the gorillas to london for money
. will tarzan find out which family he belongs to
and save the apes
? i ' m not gonna tell you
, sorry
. you ' re gonna have to see for yourself
.
and see it you shouldnt
; the animation isnt
, as always
, top notch
, particually wehn tarzan goes soaring through the trees
( read that
, skateboarding
)
. the deep canvas computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle which tarzan lives in
. inaddition fact
, it seems simular to the coputer imagery
/ cel animation combination in rival disney animted films
, such as fox ' s anastasia
and dreamworks ' prince of egypt
. could it be that disney wass actually taking ideas from their rivals
? the casting is fairly ogod
. tony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan
(
and to my relief
, the animators have succeeded in not making him another hercules
. nicely done
)
,
and glenn close is wonderful as kala
( she has a beautiful singing voice
, too
, by the way
)
. lance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson ' s beast voice
, which makes him all the more ferocious
and gripping
. minnie driver had me a little worried at first as the voice ofthe jane
. i thougth she had tyhe most annoying voice in the whole film
( when i first saw the trailers
)
,
but when i saw the film
, i didn ' t have a problem with her
. i take back my insult on driver
. it ' s nice tothe hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for a disney animated feature
( he was fflewdurr flamm infact disney ' s most underrated classic
, the black cauldron
)
; he is funny
and delightful as profesor porter
. on the villiany side of the voices
, brian blessed
( the guy who did boss nass inwhich star wars
: episode i
- the phantom menace
) brings a pompous
,
and later on vicious
, voice to the sinister clayton
. he might not be thge strongest chracter in the film
( he ' s just a plain bad guy
, nothing else
)
,
but blessed ' s vocal work contibutes greatly
.
but if there isnt any voice that i think steals hte whole show
, it shoud be rosie o ' donnell
, who is hilariously funny as terk
. she also has a fiesty attitude
(
" i ' m gonna kill ya
!
" she says
, more than once
)
. i almost sung allong with her during one of the film ' s best moments
, where the apes make a mess of the human ' s camp
, via song
, er
, scatting
" shoo
- be
- doo
, da
- be
- dah
"
. i can see why she wanted to have a rock song for the film
, she ' s a good singer
. not that she was the only funny character in the film
,
though
. wayne knight
( who played stan in space jam
) gives a whimsically funny style to tantor
, an elephant who is especially worried about stepping into
" un
- sanitary
" water
.
( thankfully
, there is no rela sound of flatuence
- that would have killed teh picture
)
. the songs
, as i said before
, are decent
, mostly sung by collins
. this sets a new standard for disney animated films because for the first time
, the characters do not sing
. i tolerate musical numbers from characters a lot more than some other guys would
,
but i found this to be a nice change of pace
. the storey does have elements of comedy in it
,
but they also load it witht strong dramatic touches
, which makes this film far better than the unbelieveably uninspired hercules
. if there is anything disappointing about tarzan
, it might be the omission of the ' n sync version of
" trashing the camp
" from the film
. i heard it on the soundtrack
,
and wondered where it was going to be
. i was upset that it wasn ' t
, because i had thougth ofthe taking a few friends of mine who like ' n sync to see tarzan
. oh
, well
.
.
. overall
, i was enthralled with tarzan
. i wouldn ' t hold it high the way i dont with mulan or the hunchback of notre dame
( my all
- time favorite disney classics
)
,
but this film deserves a high place among disney ' s greatest achievements
. i give a nod to disney for following up their spectacular
*
*
*
*
* masterpiece
, mulan
, with this gerat animated adaption of egar rice burrough ' s tarzan
.
