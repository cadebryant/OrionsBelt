director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is veyr rare in hollywood these days
( terry gilliam comes to mind as another one
)
. film is one of the best art forms becasue not only can you tell a story
,
but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail
and have it mean something
.
but most directors seem tothe go for action with the slightest ounce of a story
. so whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential
, the film almost automatically deserves a good review
.
and whn tehy add a fascinating stoy to it
, you have nearly perfect entertainment
. fincher
' s the game is no exception to this
. the game is noe of the most interesting
and complex films to come out ofthe hollywood in a long time
. fincher hasn
' t made a film since
" seven
,
" his box office
and crtical hit which defied expectations
and became one of the best movies ever
. so it is baout time he made another film
.
and what a ride it is
. the game isn
' t quite as powerful as
" seven
,
"
but in some ways it is better
. overall
, the game could ahev used a little more clarity
, or a little more uncertainty
. it walks a line of insanity annd reality
,
but it never goes either way utnil the very end
. the outcome is satisfying enough for yhe preceding events
,
and it makes a lot of sense once everything is set straight
. unfortunately
, unlike
" tje usual suspects
,
" we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening
, whether it be true or false
.
however
, this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent
. the gameboy is told completely from its main charater
' s point of view
. nicholas van orton
( michael douglas
) isnt a high
- strung
and isolated businessman
. he lives alone in his giant mansion
, divorced from his wief elizabeth
,
and is celebrating his 48th birthday
; the same age at which his father committed suicide at
, in the same mansion
. for his 48th birthday
, conrad
( sean penn
)
, the rebel ofthe the family
, gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs
: consumer recreation services
.
" it will make your life fun agian
,
" his brother promises
. as skeptical as nicholas is
, he is somewhat intrigued
,
and annoyed by the lack of informtion
-
- something this businessman hates
. seeing a billboard in an office
, he decides tothe visit the mysterious comapany
. jim feingold
( james rebhorn
) greets nicholas
and guides him through the sign
- up process
, which consists of psych
- tests
, physicals
, emotional responses
,
and other mind games
.
" each game is suited to each person
' s emotional
and psychological needs
,
" explains feingold
. one day
, nicholas gets a call from crs
and they explane that he failed the tests
. even mroe intrigued
and nowe somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up
, he starts asking aroud to see what people can tell him about the company
. what he doesn
' t realize is that the game has already begun
. the phone call is just the first of many strange events tothe be thrown nicholas
' way
. how he finds out thast he is involved has tothe be witnessed because it is amusing
and fun
and visually impressive
. tje detail involved in fincher
' s shots is incredible
and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them
. wiht
" seven
,
" fincher had almost every single shot mean something
. he also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants yuo to
. compared to
" seven
,
"
though
, the game is light
and comical
. because of this film
' s sense of humer
and self
- awareness
, nothing can be taken quite seriously
. so don
' t try to make much sense of what goes on in the game
, because it doesn
' t want yuo to
. what doens make sense isnt the final revelation
-
- when everything becomes apparent
and clear
. if taken as it isnt
, tje game
' s ending makes complete sense
.
but if you try
and critique every minute detail
,
then you git yourself into plot holes annd incredibility
. perhaps that is the reason i docked the film
. while trying to remain realistic adn plausible
, the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension onthe screen
. we don
' t really care if douglas
' character lives or not because it isn
' t believable
. the ending requires you to hvea believed anything that has happened previously
,
but if you suspend disbelief
and take the film as it is
, you can accept the game as an emotionally
and psycholically disturbing thriller
. michael douglas gives a terrific performance as nicholas
. douglas has played lonely businessmen before
,
but here he adds another levle to his performance
. his character
, who is normally level
- headed
and relies on facts
, is forced to trust nobody
. can he believe the waitress he bumped into
? what about his brother who got him involved iin the game in the first place
? douglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well
,
and gives one of his best performances
( even better tahn his
" falling down
" persona
)
. the supporting cast is essential in this film
,
and casting was critical
. sean penn is always good
,
and he gives
yet another credible performance as douglas
' brother
. deborah kara unger
( from
" crash
"
) is the waitress he bumps into
,
and her performance is extremely good
. in fact
, she almost steals yhe film from douglas
. james rebhorn portrays his charcter very well
,
and adds some confusion
and desparation to douglas
' predicament
. another good performance comes fomr armin mueller
- stahl
( from
" shine
"
) as the book editor
.
but considering tyhat douglas is in every single scene of the game
, he not only comm
ands this cast
,
but makes this distant
and lonely carachter come to colorful life
. the game is rated r fo language
, violence
, some gore
,
and some nudity
and drugs
. what is essential for this film to work is the writing
. john brancato annd michael ferris have woven a confusing
and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue
,
and some vyer funny moments
. this screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does allmost exactly the same thing the usual suspects
' did
.
however
, hte visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot
.
and if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring onthe the screen
, you iwll be thoroughly entertained by one ofthe this year
' s best films
.
