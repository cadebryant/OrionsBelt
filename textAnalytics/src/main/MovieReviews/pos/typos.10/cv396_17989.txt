well i
' ll be damned
, what a most excellent surprise
. not to be confused with the campy
and far inferior 1988 remake starring ex
- porn star traci lords
, tihs more recent attempt at remaking the 1950
' s drive
- inspite schlockfest not of tihs earth is a real gem
and was quite possably the best sci
- fi flick of 1995
. once again
, b
- movie king roger corman is behind this efort
( he directed the original
)
but this time he appears onyl in the role of executive producer
. the rest of the crew
and cast are realtive unknowns
. it seems criminal that the film was released direct to video in most countries
, because it
' s an absolute must
- see for sci
- fi fans
and a treat for anyone who enjoys decently acted
and written thrillers with a kooky bent
. the plot in brief
. paul johnson
( michael york
) is an alien posing as an eccentric millioniare who
,
though needing to kill people to live
, is visiting earth for far from selfish reasons
. his race is dying of a mysterious blood disease
and he desperately is trying to find a cure
, the key of which lies in the blood of humans
. he visits
and soon puts under his spell the respected blood physician dr
. rochelle
, whom he hypnotises into doing secret research on his behalf
. he also has the doctor convince smart
and sexy nurse am
anda
( elizabeth barondes
) to move inaddition with johnson as his private nurse so as to give him the blood transfusions which he constantly requires
.
but before long
, am
anda
and johnson
' s sleazy chauffeur release that johnson is a lot more than just eccentric
. i must admit
, my first glimpse of the video cover for not of this earth was not encouraging
. british actor michael york has appeared in some real stinkers in past fewd decades
, a far cry from the quality fare of his younger days such as caberat
( 1972
)
.
but his performance here as an alien in human disguise is nothing short of outst
anding
. the weird twitches
and bizarre modes of speech
, the dapper clothes
and cool spectacles
, the unexpected pathos which he invests in his character
. york is by turns hilarious
, menacing
and tragic
. this is a tour
- de
- force
and quite simply the best peformance i
' ve seen from him
.
and while obviously made onthe a modest budget
, the film boasts enormous strengths
. the casting is spot onthe
, the acting is terrific
and the script is intelligent
, witty
and consistently engaging
, cleverly updating the original
. the balance of horror
and humour is just about perfect
, a marked contrast to the earlier remake from 1988
. the film doesn
' t drag for a second ofthe its 90 minute running time thanks tothe tight editing annd the sure h
and ofthe little
- known director terrance h
. winkless
.
and it doesn
' t matter one bit that the special effects are cheesy
- this is schlock after all
, even if it is high class schlock
. in fact my only criticism of the film is that things get a tad weak towards the end
. tighter direction could have given the climax more urgency
and a few ofthe thge characters ect rather illogically given their life
- threatening situation
.
but these are minor complaints
. just see it
. not ofthe this earth is one of the biggest sci
- fi surprises in years
. adn michael york
: in one cool swoop you
' ve made yourself a b
- movie legend
, dude
