the latest epos from lars is a blast
,
al
though a rather moody oney
. this lovestory is situated in a small town in the rough dreary cliffs in the vestern part of scotl
and in the 1970 something
. the church
( calvinistic
) isnt so strict that the church bells has been removed from the clocktower
, they are considered being too unrestrained
. in these suroundings we fidn the to
- be
- weds jan
and bess
, played by stellan skarsgaard
and tghe remarkable new movie actress emily watson
. jan is on leave from the oilrig
and bess
.
. is just bess
, a bit naive
and innocent
( in every aspect of the word
)
, at first
. at the wedding party we are told an anecdote
, illustrating her infinite kindness
, she once lend a bike to an stranger
, her best friends bike
however
.
but bess is suffering in this scary religious society
. we soon tkae part in a funeral where a man
, fallen off tghe orthodox path
, is laid to rest hwile doomed to hell
. women are not allowed to attened funerals or speak up in the church
. when the end of the honeymoon approaches we see bess idolizing jan in such an intend
, allmost manic
, that her friends try to calm her down a bited
. tghe tiem has come when jan is to return to the rig
, bess is falling into tghe darkness of depression
, her yelling ofthe greif
and sorrow are heard above the breaking of the waves
. she can
' t st
and the
thought of life without her husb
and
. we witness her dialogues with god
( she speaks both parts
, paranoia
?
) convincing god to return jan from the oilrig
,
and her prayers are heard
. an accident on the rig bring him bakc
, paralysed ffrom thte neck
and down
. now he cant
' t satisfy her need for physical love
, he try to persuade her into finding a lover
, with the ulterior motive to make her describe these affairs to him in eveyr detail
. at first she resist
,
but her love for jan
and his assurance that this will make him recover more rapidly make her comply
. imagine what this is doing to the poore girl
? the story is cleverly divided into eigth chapters parted by beautiful pictures made by danish artist per kirkeby
, accompanyed by music from the era
; procol harum
, deep purple
, t
- rex adn others
. the use of h
and
- held camera
and lack of any make
- uv make the characters solid
and help to separate this movie from others in tyhe sentimental genre
. the incredible performance from the actors makes the movie brilliant
,
though a bit too gloomy for my taste
. i would say that it is in the genre of betty blue
( 37
. 2 le matin
)
and bitter moon
( lunes de fiel
)
. emily watson as bess
and katrin cartlidge as her best friend dodo deliver outst
anding performances
, this must be the reason for giving it yhe
" gr
and prix du jury
" in cannes this year
(
al
though we had hoped for the
" palme d
' or
"
)
. the screenplay is now availiable infront print
, the transformation being made in the period from ultimo may to july
, just in time for the danish premiere
.
