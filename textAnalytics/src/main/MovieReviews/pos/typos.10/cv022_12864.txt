a fully loaded entertainment review
- website coming in july
!
> from ace ventura to truman burbank
, jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic
,
yet sympathetic
, characters
. 1996 ' s the cable guy was supposed to be his big
" breakthrough
" role from zany humor into darker
, more dramatic acting
. as most everyone knwos
, the results were
, well
, less
- than
- stellar
. not only did the film not do so hot at the box office
,
but it was also panned by criticists
. as far as i knwo
, gene siskel
and i are the only ones willing to admitt that we dug it
. tghe first time i saw the cable guy
, inwhich theatres
, i was in super critic
- mode
,
anbd didn ' t really like it
.
however
, due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day
, i ' ve had time to lean back
, relax
,
and take in thge film
.
and to my surprise
, it grew on me
. teh plot is rather simple
: broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy
, played by carrey
,
then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship
. see
, steven ' s been having some problems with his girlfriend
, robin
( leslie mann
)
,
and he doesn ' t think he has any more room in his life for a new friend
. also
, some of the cable guy ' s antics have been creeping him outloud
. carrey
, as the cable guy
, gives steven various aliases
, which later we find out are all tv characters
: larry tate
, chip douglas
, ricky ricardo
, etc
. he apparently lives in his cable van
,
and while many critics didn ' t enjoy this newer
, darker
, less
- manic performance from carrey
, i thought it ws interesting
and rather well
- done
. for me
, its not the movei as a whole that ' s enjoyable
,
but rather several individual scenes
: a karaoke jam at steven ' s apartment
, a medieval fight at a theme restaurant
,
annd a bathroom beating
( a la liar
, liar
)
, just to name a few
. perphas thge fact that omre of carrey ' s humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny
.
and if you really want to see something
, yuo ' ve got to hear his version of jefferson airplane ' s
" somebody to love
"
, sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam
. the cable guy has its bad spots
, like most any movie
. i didn ' t particularly like steven ' s girlfriend
,
and i felt thast omre focus should have beeen used on the relationship between steven
and his best friend
. also
, the ending
, while having you fooled for a moment
, is rather contrived
,
and somewhat dissapointing
. still
, i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture
; if yuo ' re at the video store
and can ' t think of anytying to rent
, i suggest you try it out
. or if you have hbo
, just wait till it comes onthe
( you won ' t have to wait long
.
) hell
, that ' s what i do every day
.
