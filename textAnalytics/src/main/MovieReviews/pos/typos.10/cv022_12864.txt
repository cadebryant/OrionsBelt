a fully loaded entertainment review
- website coming in july
!
> from ace ventura to truman burbank
, jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic
,
yet sympathetic
, charachters
. 1996
' s the cable guy ws supposed to be his big
" breakthrough
" role from zany humer into darker
, more dramatic acting
. as most everyone knows
, the results were
, well
, less
- than
- stellar
. not only did the film nto dont so hot at the box office
,
but it was also panned by critics
. as far as i know
, gene siskel
and i are the only ones willing to admit thyat we dug it
. tyhe firt time i saw the cable guy
, in theatres
, i was in super critic
- mode
,
and didn
' t really like it
.
however
, due tothe the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day
, i
' ve had time to lean back
, relax
, annd take in the film
.
and to my surprise
, it grew on me
. the plot is rather simple
: broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy
, played by carrey
,
then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship
. see
, steven
' s been having soem problems with his girlfriend
, robin
( leslie mann
)
,
and he doesn
' t think he has any more room inwhich his life for a new friend
. also
, some of the cable guy
' s antics have been creeping him out
. carrey
, as the cable guy
, gives steven various aliases
, which later we find out are all tv characters
: larry tate
, chip douglas
, ricky ricardo
, etc
. he aparently lives in his cable van
,
and while many criticists didn
' t enjoy this newer
, darker
, less
- manic performance from carrey
, i
thought it was interesting
and rather well
- done
. for me
, its not the movie as a whole that
' s enjoyable
,
but rather several individual scenes
: a karaoke jam at steven
' s apartment
, a medieval fight at a theme resaurant
,
and a bathroom beating
( a la liar
, liar
)
, just tothe name a few
. perhaps the fatc that more of carrey
' s humorous side comes outloud during theese scenes is what makes them so funny
.
and if you really want to see something
, you
' ve got to hear his version of jefferson airplane
' s
" somebody to lveo
"
, sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam
. the cable guy has its bad spots
, like most any movei
. i didn
' t particularly like steven
' s girlfriend
,
and i felt that more focuse should have been used on the relatiopnship between steven
and his best friend
. also
, the ending
, while having you fooled forthe a moment
, is rather contrived
,
and somewhat dissapointing
. still
, i foudn the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture
; if you
' re at the video store annd can
' t think ofthe anything to rent
, i suggest you try it out
. or if you have hbo
, just wait till it comes on
( you won
' t have to wait long
.
) hell
, that
' s what i do every day
.
