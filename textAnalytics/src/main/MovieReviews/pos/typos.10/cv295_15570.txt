lean
, mean
, escapist thrillers are a tough product to come by
. most are unnecessarily complicated
, adn others have no sense of expediency
-
- the thrill
- ride effect gets lost in the cumbersome plot
. prehaps the ulitmate escapist thriller was the fugitive
, which featured none of the flash
- bang effects of today
' s market
but rather a bread
-
and
-
butter
, textbook example of what a clever script
and good direction is all about
. the latest tony scott movei
, enemy of the state
, doesn
' t make it to that level
. it
' s a true nineties product that runs like greased lightning through a maze of cell phones
and laptop computers
, without looking back
.
al
though director scott has made missteps in the past
, such as the lame thriller the fan
, he
' s generated a good deal of energy in pictures like crimson tide
and top gun
. that vibrant spirit is present here
, shown inthe well
- timed
and carefully planned chase scenes that give the movie an aura of sheer speed
. enemy of the state also features an unprecedented use of amazing cinematography
-
- director of photography daniel mindel throws a staggering amount ofthe different views
, angles
, lenses
,
and film stocks at the audience that goes a long way toward involving the audience iin the movie
. enemy is truly a visual experience
,
and that
' s only one of tyhe reasons it
' s such a fun watch
. the movie lights up with an aging senator visited by nsa deputy chief thomas reynolds
( jon voight
)
. reynolds wants a new communications act passed tothe allow the government free reign in tjhe use of surveilance equipment
,
but tje senator plans to bury the bill in committee
. reynolds has thge senator offed
,
but not before the murder is caught on a naturalist
' s camera
. by an extremist chain of events
, tjhe tape ends up in labor lawyer robert dean
( will smith
)
' s posession
,
and it
' s not long before he
' s running from reynolds
' cronies
. it
' s only with the help of an ex
- spook named brill
( gene hackman
) that dean is able to get to the bottom of things
. the acting is top notch
,
and the three principles
- smith
, hackman
,
and voight
- are generally more mature
and excellent all around
. smith puts asside the wisecracking act
and becomes a normal human being
; voight tones down the ammount of sneer he puts into his character for greater ominpotence
;
and hackman is simply over the top in the mysterioso role
. smith
' s regular joe comes off particularly well
, as he runs ffrom authorties for reasons that he knows not
. the supports are also in fine form
, lending credibility to the main roles
and advancing the plot in key areas
. this is
, fo the holiday crowd
, the hot ticket
; as well as anyone looking for a serving of genuine action in a market that is otherwise lacking
.
