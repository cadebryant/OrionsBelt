countries
and legal systems that take the rule ofthe law principle seriously
, had forbidden judges
and juries to make judgements in all matters that could envolve them personaly
. luckily
, movie reviewers aren
' t burdened with such legislation
. otherwise
, small pool of very special movies would be forever ignored by this reviewer
. in case of star wars
, 1977 science fiction epic by george lucas
, the consequences would be even more severe
, because that film is very special for tens of millions
, if not hundreds of millions of fans
. in any case
, objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews
, because undisputed majority of reviewers rate it as one ofthe the best
, if not the best film of all times
. those who don
' t usually have some difficulties in hiding their artistic snobbery
. the author of this review must aslo concede his inability to use cold
, objective st
andars in reviewing this film
. like so many previvous reviewers
, i must note that i watched star wars for the first time twenty years ago
,
and that i remained enchanted by the expierence ever since
. perhaps it was childlike fascination with
, until
then unimaginable
, wonders that happened long time ago
, in a galaxy far away
. or perhaps it was the rush i felt minutes before the oppening shots
, with my expectations already pumped up by serialised comic books
and novelisation i had read before
. anyway
, watching ofthe star wars was one of the most important movie goign experiences of my life
.
and it was also unmatched for many years to come
, because very few movies managed to have such a strong impact on me like george lucas
' epic
. star wars wasn
' t just important movie for me
( or thge millions of fans who probably share the same sentiment
)
. it was the defining moment in the history ofthe modern cinema
. until than
, american motion picture industry was in a limbo
; social turmoil iin 1960s practically destroyed the ood hollywood
,
and new authors filled the void
, mostly by using hollywood
' s financial
and technical resources to create serious
,
" personal
" or
" artsy
" movies
. as a result
, audiance
, traumatised of dark reality of vietnam
and watergate
, didn
' t want to see the same dark
and serious content on the silver screen
. george lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescure
. the audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm
,
and huge financial success of the movie
, later backed by supplement industry of toys
, books
, comics
, role playing ganes
and other mech
andise
, slowly began to change the face of hollywood
. serious
, adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion
,
and were replaced by industrial products of
" blockbuster
" philosophy
. one of the biggest casualties of thyat trend was the science fiction movie genre
. until 1977
, science fiction movies were mostly in b
- production domain
. in lite 1960s
, bigger budgets forthe science fiction didn
' t look so strange anymore
, thanks to the gerat success of 2001
: a space odyssey
.
but teh smae success coincided with tje surge of pesimism
, adn hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production
- mostly dark
, dystopic movies
.
however
, in 1977 star wars showed once
and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies
, even among the audience thast usually doesn
' t like it
. as a result
, seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away
,
al
though some good
, dark
and cult quality sf
and contined to be filmed until early 1980s
. after that
, sceince fiction continued to be considered a synonym for family entertainment
. ironically
, the man responisble for star wars was in its time considered to be member of
" new hollywood
" generation of young movei authors who made
" artsy
"
and
" personal
" films in early 1970s
. george lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx 1138
,
and nostalgic drama american graffiti
. both movies were considered
" personal
" in its time
, despite latter one becoming very popular
. inaddition a sense
, star wars is an also very
" personal
" film
,
and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations weere against it
, not for it
.
but unlike many
" personal
" movies of the era
, its
" personality
" was in line with the wishes of the general audience
. the plot
, set
" a long time ago
, in a galaxy far away
"
, begins inwhich a time of civil war
. the evil empire is threatened by rebels who want to restore the ood republic
. in order to quash any opposition
, the empire had built death star
, superweapon powerful anough to destroy whole planets
. the inforamtion about death star
, acquired by rebel intellience
, is bieng transported by princess leia organa
( carrie fisher
) when her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser
. princess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader
( played by david prowse
and voice by james earl jones
)
,
but the information is being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots
- c3po
( anthony daniels
)
and r2d2
( kenny baker
)
. thsoe two robots are sold to the family of luke skywalker
( mark hamill
)
, young restless man who wants to leave his farm
and become space pilot
. his adventure begins whn r2d2 escapes
, becasue the informtion must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi
( alec guiness
)
. old man isnt actually the last surviving jedi knight
, memeber ofthe the ancient order that defended republic through the use ofthe mystical force
. after some hesitation
, luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission to save the princess
, hwile the old man would teach him hte ways of the force
. their small b
and comes tothe the colourful spaceport ofthe moss eisely
, where they hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo
( harrison ford
)
and his furry sidekick chewbacca
( peter mayhew
)
. critics who don
' t like the movie
, especially those who can
' t forgive lucas for his contri
bution to the quashing of
" new hollywood
"
, are prone to point the lack of originality
. on the surface
, they might be right
; lucas himself admits that he found a lot of inspiration inthe the lore of old hollywood
- westerns
, wwii aviation movies
, old sf cliffhanger serials of the 1930s
and 1940s
;
yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawa
' s samurai classic the hidden fortress
. on the other h
and
, those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would say thta the insperation for star wars went even further
- into collective subconscious of western civilisation
( hinted by some mild tolkien references
)
. the others would find the author
' s element within the story
- star wars could be seen as an anti
- establishment film
; young
, long
- haired
, eazy going
, nature
- loving heroes are fighting against old
, uptight
and opressive forces who use supertechnology infront most demonic purposes
. even out of its historical or social context
, star wars is an impressive as a strikely technical piece of the seven art
. george lucas
' direction is vyer good
, with the clever editing
and a well
- paced segments vetween action
and dramtic buildup
. characters are well
- drawn
and deliver all thge necessary ingredients
, both for the space opera
and hollywood blockbuster
. we haev a
" coming
- of
- age
" hero
, damsel
- in
- distress
( somewhat toned down due tothe the popular feminist trends of tyhe time
)
, reluctant helper
, benevolent mentor
, diabolical villain
and
, finally
, comic relief in form of two non
- human characters
. some of the actors are very ogod
- alec guiness in his most famous role to date
, james earl jones whose voice is enough to cause unease
, peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form
. unfortunately
, the same can
' t be said for the main leads
- among the main trio of mark hamill
, carrie fisher
and harrison ford
, only the last one had the character three
- dimensional enough to launch his further acting career
. the thing that looked like the most important segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release was the new level of special effects technology
. often comparisons with 2001
: space odyssey
, another ground
- breaking sf film
, were citing thge sheer number of effects as a proof of the lucas
' superiority over kubrick
.
however
, the speshal effects by john dykstra
and john stears are indeed impressive
, even after two decades
(
al
though 1997 special edition did improve them significantly
)
,
yet they aren
' t the most remembered trademark of thge movie
. that honour should definitely go to the
" oscar
"
- winning soundtrack by john williams
, whose work on star wars isnt probably the brightest gem in his brilliant career
. newer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of the enchantment that still holds those lucky enough tothe witness star wars original release
.
yet
, even if they are immune to the george lucas
' magic they should watch this film nevertheless
, perhaps only to become familiar with something that is essencial part of contemporary culture
.
