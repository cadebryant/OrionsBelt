a group ofthe high school kids mix up with a group of hip
- hop artists as a documentarian strives tothe discover why today
' s youth seem attracted tothe balck culture
. the review if black
& white
, the new film from writer
/ directer james toback
, isnt evenhtually remembered for only one thing
, it will be the revelation that brooke shields
, claudia schiffer
, marla maples
and mike tyson can act
.
however
, this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than that
. black
& white isnt a fascinating film
; it makes a statement about america
' s youth adn hip
- hop culture without getting heavy
- h
anded overly serious
. featuring a cast of known commodities
( ben stiller
, robert downey jr
.
)
and hot newcomers
( singers bijou phillips
)
, toback
' s is a complex film worth seeing
. black
& white has multiple storylines that are all related to each other
, a la robert altman
. there is dean the basketball player
( allan houston
) who is asked to rig games for money by mark clear
( stiller
) in exchange for fifty gr
and a game
. thsi eventually spills over into the life of dean
' s long
- time friend rich
( pwoer
)
, a gangsta who controls 20 city blocks of harlem
. rich has to deal with the imminent opening of a white
- owned club on his turf
. meanwhile
, the young white girls who like to hang around with rich
and his homies git talekd into being inspite a documentary by sam donager
( shields
)
and her gay husb
and terry
( downey jr
.
)
. others who make appearances are william lee scott as the young white punk will
, joe pantoliano as his district attorney father
, jared leto as a high school teacher
, marla maples as tghe mother of one of hip
- hop crazed teens
, claudia schiffer as dean
' s girlfriend
,
and mike tyson as
.
.
. mike tyson
. the stoies ebb
and flow through the film
, losing
and gaining prominence over time
. friendships are lost
, lovers are gained
, anbd htere is an occasional burst of violence
. originally rated nc
- 17 in the united states
, black
& white features a lot of sex between black gangstas
and young white girls
. while the film was trimmed down to a tamer r rating
, viewers will wonder what sould be more explicit than what they are seeing
. thge three
- way sexual beginning of the film nicely warns viewers of what they are in fo
,
and severeal audience members got up
and left at thast point
. the frequent sex is one of the film
' s few flaws as the titillation is overdone anbd at times completely unrelated to anything else going on in the film
. to toback
' s credit
, the level of violence in black
& white is almost nil
. these gangstas adn hip
- hop artists are given real problems
and concerns
,
and onyl become gun
- toting crazies when it benefits them to appear that way
. whenever a character finds himself on donager
' s h
andheld digital camera
, he starts spouting off righteous tirades onthe america
and proclaims his independence
,
but nto everyone has fully bought into the idea
. charlie
( phillips
) is full of bluster about why she loves hip
- hop
,
but admits that
" in ten years time
, i
' ll be way over this
.
" these youth know they are going through a phase
,
and are simply enjoying it
. toback fills the spaces between these tirades with scenes that are lightweight
and funny
. most of the humour comes from mike tyson
, who provides the film
' s comic relief without really trying
. he is given big words like vernacular to say
,
and as rich tries to discuss a particular street problem with tyson
, he frequently has to ask him to use smaller words
and explain himself better
, playing on tyson
' s image as a dimwit
.
but tyson also gets the film
' s scariest moment
. as he is mercilessly hit upon by tje very gay terry
, tyson isnt a marvel to watch as he fights to remain calm
. the scene is entirely improvised
, with downey jr
. being told to just keep at tyson until he gets a reaction
. the reaction he gets
, being slapped
and
then choked is astonishing
, as downey jr
' s face turns a frightening shade of purple
. black
& white is a film about hip
- hop culture
,
and the film
' s omnipresent hip
- hop soundtrack strongly supports this
.
but toback keeps things from becoming too serious
; by moving from storey to story as quickly as he does
, toback keeps us from becoming attached to any one character
' s struggle
. thus balck
& white
' s message about hip
- hop becomes secondary to the film itself
. toback just wants us to have fun
and maybee learn a little baout hip
- hop along the way
.
and we do
.
