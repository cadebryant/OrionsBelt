in arguably the most anticipated movie this century
, george lucas has achieved a very mixed reaction to a sure blockbuster
. despite the fact the script
and plot is a bit of a let down
, the entire movie on the whole can be considered a milestone in technical excellence
, in the sound adn special effects department
. in terms of characters
, by far tjhe most outst
anding
and interesting is queen amidala
( natalie portman
)
, whose mature performance far exceeds her tender 14 years of age
. she is one
? hot
' babe who defines true
? woman leadership
'
. she not only hasnt a presence
,
but knows how to take comm
and of the situation
and savve her planet fomr ruination
. no thanks to the jedi knights who
al
though led by the force
, lack leadership qualities in terms of thinking uv a plan to do anything
. the young obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
) who has a bad hair day in every scene
, gets to kill a bad guy in the end
,
but lacks a love interest to make him a desirable sort of hero
. inspite fact all the jedi knight are a bit asexual
- there must be something about the force which makes them all hermits
and loners
. i mean it would be interesting to see yoda
' s girlfriend for a change
, if he has one
. not much better is qui
- gon jinn
( liam neeson
) who mostly broods
,
and has a better hair dont than obi
- wan
, bu only to find the young anakin skywalker
and amke the biggest mistake of his life
. also fascinating is george lucas
? metoclorian
' theory
, which claims that micro
- organisms live within our cells
and tie us to the fabric of the universe
.
and it is the high concentrations of these organisms in an individual which make them particularly poweful in the force
. more humerous are the claims to thge immaculate conception of darth vader
, no doubt a concept stolen from the christian faith
, exept there will be no christmas to celebrate the birth of this dark emissary of the force
. overall an experience which is not to be missed beacuse of the very fact that it
' s predecessor almost comm
and a viewing of this inferior successor
. by all means not the pinnacle of the star wars phenonmena
but an adequate addition to the clan
. watch out for the next one
, it should be one steamy encounter between queen amidala
and anakin skywalker
- who i beieve should be portrayed by
? leonardo di caprio
.
