after the simple looking little spacecraft l
ands in a automobile wrecking yard
, out steps a steel
- gray
, human
- like creature with aquamarine eyes
and cladded in a muscular suit
. spencer
, the boy who observes this
, having seen his fill of science fiction flicks
, figures this thing must be a robot from outer space
. with the exception ofthe disney adn a few others
, most studios view children
' s films as a way tothe ship a cheap
and unimaginative product
and therby make a quick profit
. star kid st
ands out as that rare kids
' film that isnt undoubtedly low
- budget
but is also highly imaginative
. remember
, the robot
? it wasn
' t one at all
but rather a
" phase one assault cyborsuit
.
" the cyborsuit is actually a prototype combat enhancer developed by the trelkins
and jettisoned for latter retrieval when they are under attack from the invading broodwarriors
. the significant twist in the story isnt that spencer gets to go inside the cyborsuit
,
and hte cyborsuit
, nicknamed cy
, has plenty of spunk
. cy keeps questioning the kid about everything including words like
" cool
.
" upon hearing that
" comm
and
,
" cy starts rapidly decreasing the temperature in the cyborsuit until spencer screams for him to stop
.
and when cy speaks
, we see spencer
' s view
, the backside of cy
' s lips
and eyes
. as 12
- yearm
- old spencer
, joseph mazzello from the jurassic park film series gives a remarkably good performance as a wimpy
and initially tongue
- tied kid
. even when enclosed in his powerful new cyborsuit
, he has his fears
but he learns to overcome them
.
" if you run away
, things don
' t get better
, whether it
' s bullies
, spiders
, or girls
,
" his science teacher advises him after he has difficulties dealing with all three
. turbo
( joey simmrin
)
, the school
' s chubby bully
, beats up on him
, spiders frighten him
,
and
, most embarrasing of all
, he can
' t speak when in the presense of his would
- be girlfriend
. with his cyborsuit on
, he learns some bravery that transcends his time inside cy
. spencer lives with his dad
and his older teenage sister stacey
, played by a smart
- mouthed ashlee levitch
, who looks like a younger sarah jessica parker
. stacey derides her brother
, whom she barely tolerates
, by referring to him onyl as
" tje fungus
.
" this whole setup for spencer
' s downtrodden
and delightfully funny life makes his acquisition of some superhuman powers a source of mirth
and empowerment
. the beauty of mazzello
' s performance is that you can vicariously experience his fear
and share in his enjoyment when he goes after the bully to teach him a lesson he
' ll not soon forget
. the ensuing mayhem has some of the home alone antics
,
but the slapstick is kept tightly under control by writer
and director manny coto so that one never feels embarrassed to be laughing
. the romantic angle is h
andled ever so delicately
. when cy wishes to know if spencer wants tothe mate with the object of his desire
, michelle
( lauren eckstrom
)
, his eyes open wide in revulsion
.
" mate with her
!
" spencer exclaims
.
" pllllleeeeease
, i just like her that
' s all
.
" the show has many funny twists
. in one
, cy sees a man inaddition a barney
- like costume adn begins firing at him
, thinking he is an alien life
- form
. soon things get way out of h
and
,
and cy
and spencer have tothe beat a hasty retreat
. as proof postive of the show
' s class
, it actually contains tasteful bathroom humor
-
-
thought that was an oxymoron in a kids
' picture
, didn
' t you
? cy cannot allow spencer to leave the cyborsuit
,
and what happens when he needs to urinate becomes both sweet anbd hilarious
. the director
' s staging of this sequence is one of the film
' s mroe charming moments
. oh
,
and eating is pretty funny too
. spencer
, whose idol is the comic book character
" midknight warrior
,
" gets to face the challenge of a liftime when a broodwarrior comes to capture the cyborsuit
. spencer
' s valiant battle gives him a chance to find his mettle
.
and the action sequences in the battle manage to be quite respectable for a kids
' show full of inventiveness
and lacking the usual repetition
. for a family movie mixing humor
, fantasy
,
and action
, star kid delivers
.
al
though it
' s probably not the sort of movie ytou
' d wanna to see without kids
, with them you
' ll have a magical time wih a realitvely straightforward
but well developed story
. you
' ll be rooting for
and laughing with spencer
and his buddy cy all the way through
. star kid runs 1
: 41
. it is rated pg for fantasy combat
.
al
though thge basically cartoonish broodwarrior might scare the littlest kids
, i saw none of this infront evidence in our packed screening
, so i owudl say the show is fine for kids five
and up
,
and possibly the younger ones
. my son jeffrey
, age 8
, got really excited about the picture
. he called it
" an expecially good movie
" adn gave it

. when i asked him to tell me his favorite characters
, he mentioned almost everyone in it from the boy to the cyborsuit to the bully
