" waking ned devine
" is a pleasant excursion to a time
and place which allows tjhe audience to absorb thte full texture of a small town
. filled with breathtaking scenery
,
' characters
'
,
and delightful music
, the movie woudl be interesting even without a plot
. the story contains several surprises which are best left unmentioned in a review
. the film starts out with a sharp oppening
, which gives us a taste of what is to follow
: country folk with an inclination forthe a bit of larceny
. what gets thigsn going is the fact that a winner of the lottery is apparently one of the residents in the small town
( pop 52
) of tullymore
. who that person is
,
and how to share in the good fortune is the mission of two longtime firends jackie

and michael
( david kelly
)
. part detectives
, part scalawags

. pacing is right
. towards the end
, it runs a bit out of steam
,
but that
' s okay because for most of the 90 minutes we
' ve been interested in the goings on
. a mixture of laughs
and
( occasional
) sentiment
- all the right emotions are engaged
. inthe one brief dream sequence
- you
' ll know it when you see it
- a fantastic combination of color
and music transports the characters to a place you really hope exists
. one ofthe the key moments in the film
. the music
, availaible on cd
( london 289 460 939
- 2
) follows the same arc as the movie
and is well worth considering
. a fine film that
' s for everybody except acation fans
. somewhat like
' the englishman who went up a hill adn came down a mountain
,
'
.
.
.
but livelier
