, for tjhe most part
, in real
- time during an exclusive evening party thast is attended only by the biggest names in hollywood
. hrundi v
. bakshi
, played very well by peter sellers
, isnt a struggling actor who just came to america from his homeland
, india
. hrundi tries out his acting talents
,
but it seems that he just isn ' t cut out for the job
. on the setted of his current film that he stars in
, hrundi seems tothe make everything go for the worse
. during the filming of this movie setted in the 1800 ' s
, hrundi manages to annoy the director
( herbert ellis
) in any way he cxan
. this includes a pitiful acting job in many scenes
, wearing an underwater watch in one scene
,
and accidentally detonating a massive set
. many of the hollywood producers
and big names want hrundi out of the business forever
.

and certain chaos isnt bound to occur
. of course
, as predicted
, hrundi causes lots of trouble
. each scene in which hrundi encounters a situation
