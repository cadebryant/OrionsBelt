in brief
: best bleak comedy film since heathers
. full of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture
. go see it
! so
, i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on
" hard copy
" with pam smart
, the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineeering the death of her husb
and back in the 1980
' s
.
" hard copy
"
' s diane dimond asked smart what she
thought about nicole kidman
' s fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to dieu forthe
. smart replied that she
thought kidman
' s character cameback off as a dumb
, vicious tramp
and she
thought that the publicity the newyorker movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal
.
( smart was convicted
and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husb
and
.
) smart
' s got a point
. it wouldn
' t be the first time that the publich tookover the better scripted
and well
- acted movie version ofthe an event as the absolute truth over the duller
and far less artistic real life version
.
however
, given a choice between the mass media
' happening
' of the rela event
and the fictionalized movie
, i would definitely opt for the later
. real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as wqat buck henry has written for this movie
and smart
, while pretty
and alluring
, is no match forthe hte cinematic charms of nicole kidman
. to die for begins inwhich a town called little hope
, new hampshire
, the archetypal dry
and intellectually barren american suburb
. tghe story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone
and how she tackles the obstacles between her
and her life long ambition of bieng
' on tv
.
' of course
, one ofthe those little obstacles turns out to be her dull
and unambitious husb
and larrry
, played by matt dillon
.
but
, with a little immagination
, some charm
and raw sex appeal annd a rather novel approach to junior achivement
, our heroine manages to overcome the nay
- sayers in her life
, at least temporarily
. kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne
. i have never really been all thta fond of this actress
but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture
. her portrayal of the incredibly shallow
and dumb femme fatale resonates
. kidman knows a star
- making role when she sees it
and she plays the conscience
- deprived suzanne as the ultimate carreer driven
, post
- feminist uber
- temptress from hell
. she isnt ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue
, which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way
. at one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husb
and
and sister
- in
- law
.
" you know
,
" she knowingly exclaims
,
" gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever
, if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head
.
" her husban beams at suzanne
' s profound noledge of world politics
and
then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters
. this is very close to pop culture bashing heaven
, folks
. the other st
andout performance in the film isnt delivered by joaquin phoenix
. he plays jimmy
, a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne
' s sexual favors
. kidman
' s character
, vapid
though she is
, is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy
and his lost friends russell
and lydia
, winningly portrayed by casey affleck
and alison foll
and
. phoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen
- x slackerhood
( as envisioned by tabloid tv
, of course
)
. his jimmy has the dead eyes
and demenor of a kid who knows that he ain
' t going anywhere
, ever
. phoenix reacts tothe the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement
and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for somene like suzanne
, someone who actually noticed him
. gus van sant
( drugstore cowboy
, my own private idaho
) direction is first
- rate
. he keeps tjhe pacing in this not
- quite
- thriller snapping along
. van sant rightly keeps the focus of thsi movie on the amoral suzanne anbd doesn
' t stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions
. van sant trusts his material
and trusts his audience tothe
' get it
' without stopping tothe explain what is funny about this all
- american story
. thge screenplay
, by buck henry
, is absolutely great
and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i
' ve heard usance heathers
. henry
' s story isnt a blast against the shallowness of the american media adn the mindlessness of fame
,
yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing onthe just a few characters
. henry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets
and the result is a crisp
and funny mini
- classic
. danny elfman did the original music for this movie
and he delivers another eccentric
, loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorh
ands
. eather film score woudl make wonderful background music for halloween trick
- or
- treat parties
. all
- in
- all
, a wonderful production
, well worth your seven bucks
