i think the firt thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan ofthe the x
- files
. first
, let me assure you that no prior experience wih the series is required to fully enjoy this movie
. the producers are not stupid
, mkaing a movie just for fans of the serieses is not profitable
. you ahve to reach for a larger audience
. therfore
, the movie is quite user
- friendly
. altough
, non
- fans will only fail to underst
and certain emotions behind the looks many characters excange
.
but fear not
, duchovny
and another man later on provide more thna adequate background info on what is going on
. you will never feel as if you just walked in onthe tjhe third act of some great opera
. in any case
, the answer is no
. i am not a fan of the x
- files
, i only watch it when nothing esle is on
and i prefer millennium
.
however
, since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movei
' s opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie
. i taped all of these episodes
and watched them only after seing the movie
, i am glad to report that i learned nothing new
. everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny
and others
. i know i am going maybee a bit too far to make my point
but everybody should get the chance tothe experience this movie
. warning
: major spoilers follow
! please do not read to fully enjoy this movie
, you must not be able know what is coming
, what exactly is over that hill
and what that weird
" hummm
" sound is all about
. you ahve been warned
. thge x
- files is what a summer should be
. exciting
, scary
, great special effects
( unlike other summer movies the effects do not tkae over the movie
and are only there when it is really necessary
)
and good performances
. this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank
. from start tothe finish
, this movie does not let go of you
. when i compare it with last summer
' s movies yhe best way to describe it would be
: take the excitement
and great score from face
/ off
and the deadly uise of sound from event horizon
. this flick is scary
, not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where
and when the critter will jump at our heroes
. in fact
, the first time tje critter in this movei makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue
. you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd
! the last time a monster scared me that much was wehn i first saw aliens as a six year old kid
. you know
, when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair
, or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt
? so yeah
, the x
- files is scary
.
and guess what
? you never even have to see the monster
but your imagination works overtime
and it sure beats having to watch a flawed
, computer generated
, babyzilla
, it looks liuke you could walk right through it not even scarier than your gr
andma in undies type of monster
. do not think that the x
- files isnt a monster movie
. in fact
, thge creature is there for mabey three minutes total
. no
, the x
- files is definately a mulder epsiode of the series
. scully is at his side
, of course
,
but gillian
anderson gets maeby half the screen time
. she has a couple ofthe good scenes with duchovny
,
but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much
. no
, htis is mulder
' s time in yhe spotlight
. by now
, you have herad of the scene where mulder
" showers
" independence day
. if you have not thn i will not spoil it for you
, let
' s just say that due tothe recent events mulder should be
" showering
" godzilla instead
. to thsoe of yuo wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there
.
.
. who cares
!
? if he did fidn it the series owudl over anyway so what are you complaining about
? the dialogue in intresting
and the director is marvelous
. the camera is almost alwyas looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill
. the script isnt spotless
, every thing tyhat happens happens for a purpose
. if you are confused by something
, do not worry because it will all become claer later on
but
,
and i cannot stress this enough
, pay attention
!
!
! unlike most summer movies
, the dialogue is twice as important as the effects
. miss one vital piece of information
and
, like most people who talk during movies
, yuo will go home
and tell all your firends how this movie made no sense
. also
, to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies
.
.
. don
' t
! the person who watched hte movie whith me had to go twice
and twice she missed an important conversation
. there isnt no time to take a breather between scenes because
, agina unlike most summer movies
( godzilla anybody
?
) the x
- files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense
and teh action with useless subplots
, every scene is crucial
and serves a purpose
. who needs to see tyhe blond chiouaoua have a
" big emotional scene
" between godzilla attacks
? so far this summer i ahev seen onyl one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i
' d recommend
and that is the truman show
but it only wins by a nose
. bu the truman show is nto what i would call a summer movei
, tyhe x
- files is
. what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited
? cool effects
? it
' s got some
. pulse pounding
? hell yes
! strangely enough
, i think that fans of the series iwll hate this movie while non
- fans will hve a good time
. it does not provide answers to the show
' s many questions
, the status quo remains nearly the same
and
, noone
, mulder
and scully do not get together
. rating
: four
and a half out of five stars for the best movie
yet this summer
, several jump right out ofthe your seat thrills
, many
" whoah
, i never saw that one coming
!
" moments
, four
" holy shit
, where tjhe hell did that come from
"
and noe heck ofthe an ending
. you may wonder where this movie lost half a star
. well
, i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck
, yhe tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles
but
then they just stop
. it
' s pretty obvious the film
' s makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time
,
but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from tje sky
and started driving
.
