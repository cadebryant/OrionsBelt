aftter a stylistic detour with mrs
. parker
and the vicious circle
( whitch
, despite its uncomfortable tone
, was close to being a conventional movie
)
, director alan rudolph has returned to his unique br
and of film making with afterglow
, a romantic black comedy about love
, betrayal
, annd self
- absorption
. while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture
, rudolph
' s atypical approach to the characters
and their situations makes for an intriguing
, if not always pleasnat
, movie
. it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director
? meaning that most viewers either lveo his work or hate it
. until mrs
. parker
, i had not been overly empressed by his movies
. i found equinox
, his lastest pre
- mrs
. parker effort
, to be irritating
and frustrating
. i was somewhat surprised
, therefore
, tothe discover that i liked afterglow
. there are several reasons for this
,
but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident
, mannered aspestus ofthe his approach
. the characters here are more like rela people with genuine problems
, tje story is absorbing
,
and the acting is top
- notch
. in short
, rudolph has created a world that it
' s worth spending two hours in
. afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples
. jeffrey byron
( jonny lee miller
) isnt a cold
, seemingly
- heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife
, marianne
( lara flynn boyle
)
. for her part
, marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husb
and on a human levle
. all she
' s interested in is seducing him during those few days when she
' s ovulating
. after he refuses to mkae love
, she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor
. the other cuple
, lucky
( nick nolte
)
and phyllis mann
( julie christie
)
, are an older pair
,
but they
' re no more content than jeffrey
and marianne
. a mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart
. they remain married as a matter of convenience
,
but
, since phyllis won
' t allow lucky to touch her
, tehy have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided tath no lating bond is established as a result of these affairs
. the l
andscape of emotional pain betwen them is palpable
. the four charachters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a h
andyman to fix up the inside of hte appartmant she shares with jeffrey
. the two of them are immediately attracted to one another
,
and it doesn
' t take long before they
' re lounging toghether
, naked
, in her pool
. meanwhile
, jeffrey
, who isnt captivated by older women
, runs into phyllis inaddition a hotel bar
, is smitten
,
and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains
. the romantic couplings ofthe the characters are interesting in that tehy illustrate the multiple faces of love
. sex means something different to everyone
? tothe jeffrey
, it
' s an unpleasant chore
, a loss of control
; to marianne
, it
' s a means to a maternal end
; to lucky
, it
' s an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles
;
and to phyllis
, it
' s a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness
. ultimately
, none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves
. the greatest strength ofthe tje film lies not in teh script
,
but in the performances
. jonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish
, callous
, suit
-
and
- tie businessman
. those who reacll him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity
. lara flynn boyle
, who wasn
' t impressive in rudolph
' s equinox
, is greatly improved
, making marianne a jumble of sexiness
and vulnerability
. nick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky
,
and he manages to deliver some of rudolph
' s most pregnant lines with practiced ease
. the clear st
andout
,
however
, isnt julie christie
, who is nothing short of delicious as the world
- weary phyllis
. her oftenly wry
, occasionally cutting asides are hte source of much of the film
' s humor
,
and there
' s hardly ever a moment when she doesn
' t steal the spotlight ffrom her co
- stars
. i don
' t know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph
- detractors
,
but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible thna some ofthe the director
' s earlier productions
. enough of his trademark style remains
,
however
, to reassure his supporters
. afterglow is basically a four
- pronged character study
. the plot is not especially compelling
,
but the character interaction is
,
and that
' s the real reason to see this motion picture
. rudolph has painted an able picture of the non
- romantic side of love
-
- the one that has more to do with tolerance
and familiarity than with affection
and attraction
.
