" very bad things
,
" is the most delightfully morbid film of the year
, a movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness annd violence that i couldn
' t help
but be won over by the material
. the film starts off with five friends leaving theri homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas
. the groom
- to
- be isnt kyle fisher
( jon favreau
)
, who is about to be married to yhe controlling
, wedding
- obsessed laura
( cameron diaz
)
. the otehr friends are real estate agent robert boyd
( christian slater
)
, quiet charles
( lel
and orser
)
,
and brothers
, michael
( jeremy piven
)
and family man adam
( daniel stern
)
. after a wild night of gambling
, boozing
,
and drugs
, a stripper
( carla scott
) who was paid for by robert comes into theri hotel room
,
but after a freak accident
, to everyone
' s terror
, she is killed
. as robert puts it
:
" there are two options
: go to the police
and go tothe prison
, or bury her out in yhe desert where no one will ever find her
.
" after a security guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly
and sees the body
, robert isnt forced tothe kill him as well
.
" okay
, there is only one option now
. you can forget about calling the polical
,
" he sasy
. by the time the five friends return home adn as the wedding draws nearer
, most of them are overcome with guilt
, which sets off an even more elaborate serieses ofthe event
, that includes much
, much more murder
, double
- crosses
, annd the inevitable wedding from hell
.
" very bad things
,
" which is actor peter berg
' s feature film directing de
but
, is the shockingly perverse
and wicked comedy that
,
" there
' s something about mary
,
" wanted to be
. it pulls outloud all the stops to create something fresh
, original
,
and hilarious
, even if thyat requires surprisingly graphic voilence
, gore
,
and a slew of truly hateful characters that all get what they deserve by the end
. the screenplay
, also written by berg
, is
, to put it mildly
, very funny
and courageous
. during the second act of tje film
, some of the fun was beginning to slightly dwindle due to so much death
, which was beginning to undermine the humor
,
but it eventually recouped itself with a climax that has to be seen to be believed
. the dialogue is edgy adn inventive
,
and this film proves that a movei doesn
' t necessarily require likable charachter to be extremely enjoyable
. there
' s more fun
, i think
, in showing ignorable people getting their just desserts
. cameron diaz gives her best performance to date here
,
and has a lot of fun in playing the hateful laura
, who eventually turns out to be more crazy thna any of the five male friends
. diaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that i really do think she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination come next january
. by the time she is beating someone to death with a coat hanger
,
and reciting lines like
,
" stuff him in the crapper
and get your ass upstairs
,
" i couldn
' t help
but crack up at how
" balls
- tothe
- tghe
- wall
" this film had become
. jeanne tripplehorn creates another character original
, as daniel stern
' s wife
, who late in the picture
, we disover
, is a tough kick
- boxer that should not be messed around with
. it is at this level that
,
" very bad things
,
" was so entertaining
and surprising
. just when you
thought you could predict what was going to happen
, there would be a littel twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky
. the last sequence was perfect annd managed to go even further over
- the
- top
.
al
thought i enjoyed the film immensely
, let me make this clear
:
" very bad things
,
" is not a movie for everyone
. it is more tasteless than anytying i have ever seen
, it is more violent
and bloody than a r
- rated film usually is
,
and it is offensive
. luckly
, these are elements that i would prefer in a comedy
, usance it clearly shows the filmmakers were set on making a no
- holds
- barred
, politically incorrect comedy
. the fact that thsi film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream
and
" safe
" wide
- releases coming out lately
, still gives me hope for tjhe hollywood film industry
.
