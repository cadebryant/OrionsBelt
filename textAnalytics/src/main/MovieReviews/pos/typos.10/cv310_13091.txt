i find most of television so intensely boring that i simpley never turn on my set
, unless i
' m watching a movie
. i don
' t even have cable
, so i whent to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching
" the x
- files
" every sunday night
. it
' s the only show that
' s worth an hour of my time each week
(
though
, since i don
' t watch reruns
, i
' m glad that i have six months of the year to avoid television altogether
)
. i am an avid fan of the show
,
and have been for about three years now
.
and i love gillian
anderson
. the x
- files is the film that continues the story where the season finale left off
. the film is like a two
- hour episode
, exept that there are a lot more special effects
, the plot is thicker
,
and the resolution is more satisfying
. this is a terrific film
, both for fans ofthe the series
and for those who have never seen it
( i imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid
and riveting entertainment
)
. i expected to like it more than any episode i
' ve seen
,
and my expectations were met
. actually
, the film takes a few risks in its story
and plot devices
,
but
, thankfully
, the makers managed to do it right
. when the finale ended
, the fbi branch known as thte x
- files had been destroyed
,
and our heroes
, mulder
( david duchovny
)
and scully
( gillian
anderson
) were left stripped ofthe five years ofthe hard work
. the film picks up soon after
;
and mulder
and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal building
.
but wait
, i
' m getting ahead of myself
. the film actually opens in the ice age
, about 32
, 000 years prior
, during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien
. the alien
' s blood infects them
( fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer
)
,
and the story jumps into modern times
, during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer
. it turns outloud that the bomb was planted to kill the boy
,
and mulder
and scully uncover the cover
- up despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi
. soon
, they find out tht the whole thing has to do with aliens
. as i
' ve written before
, it
' s not easy to wriet plot summaries for films like this
, because everything needs to be a surprise
. fans of the show will know what to expect
,
and i seriously doubt any ofthe them being disappointed with the film
. directer rob bowman has done a great job exp
anding the eerie feeling of the sohw to the big screen
, making small adjustments
and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television
. there are smoe truly suspenseful
and well
- creaeted scenes here
( late in the film
, when they
' re in the alien spacecraft
, you
' ll see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema
)
. the special effects are very good
,
and the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic
. what i find interesting is that hte x
- files is actually a great way forthe series neophytes tothe get inot the story
. our heroes are given subtle introductions
( we
' re not expected to know them on the outset
)
,
and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isn
' t requred to underst
and the film
. there are
, ofthe course
, littel elements that the makers have included as payoff to the fans
,
but i
' ll keep those as surprises
. it takes a lot ofthe
thought
and underst
anding of the series to create a film useing roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides
,
and
then create a coherent film that anyone can underst
and clearly
. yhe series is strong fo a lot of reasons
. it
' s orginial
(
though it has many ties to
" the twilight zone
"
and owes some homage to hitchcock
)
,
and impressively eerie for a television show
. what really makes the series shine
,
however
, are the actors
. duchovny has so much presence
, annd is just a fun guy to watch
. he has that confidence that will someday make him into a bankable leading man
.
anderson is equally good
,
and paralyzingly beautifull
; she
' s also a strong actress
. both performers have acted in little more than their series
,
however
,
though i tihkn they
' ll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon
. i enthusiastically recommend the x
- files
, both for fans
and non
- fans
. 1998 is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters
,
and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry
. it
' s an intelligent film
,
and takes you places that you might not have been
( or
, at least
, might not have seen so many times that htey feel familiar
)
. the x
- files is impressive inthe concept
, as well
: fans of the series are likely to be highly crtical
,
and to take the premise beyond tghe series is a risky move
. it
' s nice to see a risk pay off for a change
. actually
, it
' s nice to see a risk at all
.
