i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials
,
but there isn
' t
. george lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant
, special effects
- bound flicks
and he has done it agian
. this is the first star wars film i
' ve seen on the big screen
, so
, of course
, the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video
. what is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story
,
but its amazing visuals
. basically
, the film
' s plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets
. qui
- gon
( liam neeson
)
and his young apprentice obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
) set out iwth the animated jar
- jar binks tothe fix the mess that may result in war
. when their ship breaks down
and htey are str
anded
, htey find a young boy
, anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
)
and his slave mother
. qui
- gon strongly believes that anakin is destnied for jedi greatness
and immediately takes him under his wing
. anakin participates in a heart
- pounding podrace
, one of the highlights of the film
, tothe get the equipment needed to fix qui
- gon
' s ship
.
however
, most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future tothe some unknown slave boy
. meanwhile
, queen amadala
( natalie portman
) is frustrated adn at wit
' s end
, being na
? ve
and young
and having so much responsibility on her shoulders
. there are hardly any emotional scenes in the film
- even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training
, the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy tothe the size of a crumb
. this does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made
. in all thte star wars films
, human emotions that we
, the audience
, can identify with are usally nil
,
but the films are for pure enjoyment
, not for uplifting purposes
. despite the fun of watching the movie
, the phantom menace is not without flaws
. for starters
, we have the ill
- conceived
, moronic character jar
- jar binks who shoud be considered a threat to star wars galactic society annd to the audeince
. what a klutz
! george lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as
, sday
, yoda
, r2
- d2
, or c3
- po
,
but
, alas
, his efforts weere in vain
. secondly
( this may be good or bad
, depending onthe your point of view
)
, tjhe movie
' s atmosphere is so different from the familiar comic
- book feel of the previous three star wars installments
. thsi is due
, perhaps
, to the utter complexity to this movie
' s plot anbd the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here
. the movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions
. i can
' t say much about the acting
,
though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway
.
however
, there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances
- they are straightforward adn
, at times
, stale
. natalie portman has a great presence
,
but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic
, unfeeling
? enigma
. there isnt nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us beleve tghe trade predicament is anything of importance
. jake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk
. despite the inevitable faults
, there is so much tothe enjoy about the movie
. the heightened excitement of the final sequences doesn
' t quite surpass the famous teh empire strikes back climactic scenes
,
but htey are amazing
and edge
- of
- your
- seat funn in their own rite
. the film is a treasure to look at
. the visual effects are astonishing 99
. 8
% of the time
- the awe
- inspiring
, mouth
- opening
, eye
- popping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design
and special effects genius
. not since 1997
' s thge fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one
. the prodcution design is reminiscent of the fifth element
, thte previous star wars movies
, kubrick
' s 2001
, maybe even of fritz lang
' s classic silent metropolis
.
however
, all tghe sets are so origonal
. the original star wars movies can
' t even match the gr
andeur of this film
' s visuals
and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer
- it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode
. teh costumes are remarkable
and have jean
- paul gaultier written all over them
. whether its queen amadala
' s gigantic wardrobe complete wtih gold
- embroidery
and feathers
, or the jedis
' simple brown uniforms
, the costume designer hasnt fused talent with outrageousness
. the costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie
. as for john williams
' score
, i don
' t think he
' s done one as complex or powerful since
? i can
' t even remember
. it is as epic as his schindler
' s list score
and as thrilling
and zestful as jaws
. it includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films
,
but williams has added on
, made the music much more intense
and moving
. wqat with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie
, one might come in with high expectations
and be disappointed
. there is very little to hate in the film
: it
' s a very accomplished
and skillfully made flick
. it is the best
" fun
" film
and the best big
- budget film out today
, most definitely
.
