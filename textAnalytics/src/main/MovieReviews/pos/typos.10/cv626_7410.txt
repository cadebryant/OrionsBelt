this resivwar is ignorant of what h
ands were responsibile for delivering the origional version of the abyss in 1989
. whether it was the meddling of studio executives
, or the work of writer
/ director james cameron himself
, the original cut of this underwater sci
- fi thriller was entertaining enough bu also quite seriously flawed
. the main problem was fairly simple
: the film
' s climax was unworthy of its build
- up
. someone at 20th century fox
-
and no dout cameron himself
- must have agreed
, because in 1993 came the theatrical realease of the abyss
: special edition
. now availiable on video
, it seems timely to re
- evaluate what
, in its newly revamped state
, is now a near
- masterpiece despite its borrowings from films like 2010
: odyssey two
, alien
and close encounters ofthe third kind
. the plot is thus
. we meet the crew ofthe an experimental underwater mobile oil rig designed by the hard
- nosed lindsay
( mastrantonio
) annd captained by her soon
- to
- be
- divorced husb
and bud
( ed harris
)
. the rig
and its crew are diverted from their normal duties when the navy seeks their help infact investigating the mysterious sinking ofthe a u
. s
. nuclear submarine
. requiring a dive part
- way down a three mile deepo trench
, three navy divers arrive to comm
and the operation
, led by the edgy lieutenant coffey
( biehn
)
.
but a series of strange sightings soon convinces at least one memeber of the civilian crew that whoever or whatever they
' re dealing with
, as she memorably puts it
,
" aren
' t speaking russion
"
. meanwhile on the surface a hurricane is brewing
and
, even worse
, a series of incidents around cuba involving russians ships
and an increasingly nervous u
. s
. navy sets off an international crisis of possible catastrophic proportions
. this crisis is mirrored in thte confines of the now isolated underwater rig
, with the trigger
- happy
and increasingly paranoid lieutenant coffey at odds with the crew baout how do deal with the mysterious goings
- on around them
. the human drama is often riveting
, with tyhe principal players perfoming with an intensity that recalls the fine ensemble acting in cameron
' s aliens
. the stunts
, hardware
, special effects
and underwater cinematography are all outst
anding
. adn so htey should be
: cameron
' s technical credentials are well established
.
but what ultimately makes the film so gripping is three intersecting plot str
ands
: 1
) the tension between old sparring partners lindsay
and ex
- hubby bud
; 2
) tghe war ofthe wills between the civilian crew
and the navy divers as a series of escalating crisis
' befall them
;
and 3
) the slowly unfolding revelation of wqat lies at the bottom of the three mile deep abyss
. the abyss
: special edition is an improvement on the original film iin twpo major respects
. one is thyat it further fleshes out the relationship between bud
and lindsay
, a relationship at times touching
, at others incredibly intense annd volatile
. the second improvement is the restauration ofthe some absolutely crucial scenes towards the film
' s end
, wehn the aliens demonstrate their control over water with a terrifying
and extraordinary display of power to a world on the brink of nuclear war
. with the inclusion of these startling scenes
, the story
' s climax is now given real weight
. why on earth were they left out of the orignal
? this reviewer finds it utterly incomprehensible
. so thne
, we have 25 minutes of additional footage that
' s turned a decent underwater thriller into something quite magnificent
. i say
" quite
" because smoe flaws do remian
. the most grating is several moments ofthe corny hollywood schmaltz
- soem new
, smoe old
- that may well have you reaching for the barf bag
. nonetheless
, tje abyss
: special edition now st
ands this somewhat maligned film among james cameron
' s greatest achievements
, alongside aliens
and terminator 2
. see it
and be moved
, gripped
and spellbound
.
