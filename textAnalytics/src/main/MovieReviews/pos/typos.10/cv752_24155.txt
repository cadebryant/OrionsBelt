you ' ve probably heard the one about the priest
and the rabbi
,
but never with the same dosage ofthe featherweight charm that is sprinkled over
` keeping the faith '
. it ' s a fluffy comedy
, thoroughly glazed with a sense ofthe innocuous innocence
and good cheer
, regarding twpo moral topics
-
- love
and religion
-
-
adn how a romantic triangle causes the two to collide head
- onthe
. as youngsters
, brian finn
, jacob schramm
and anna reilly were an inseparable trio
. hwile theri friendship progressed
, anna always had the compassion to shower them both with the same love
and support
, so neither would feel excluded
.
but tradgedy soon struck
, as anna was forced to move away
. nowe adults
, brian
( edward norton
)
and jacob
( ben stiller
) hold similar
but contrastive jobs
. the likable
and kind
- hearted father brian is a catholic priest
, hwile the spry
and outgoing jacob acts as a jewish rabbi
. on the basketball cout
, they refer to themselves as
` the god squad '
. in teh relationship field
, brian abides by his catholic principle of celibacy
,
but jacob has reached thte point where finding a jewish bride is practically mandatory
. everything changes when anna
( jenna elfman
) returns to new york tothe visit her childhood chums
. now a workaholic
, she devotes endless hours persay week to her business
,
but does find spare time tothe reminisce with brian
and jacob
- both ecstatic about seeing their elementary school sweetheart once again
. with these oddball ingredients tossed inot one cocktail
, there ' s bound to be some ackward romance between our three central characters
. predicting the outcome is not entirely difficult
,
but
` keeping the faith ' is open
, intertaining
and refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route from point a to point b
. edward norton has emerged as one of tje finest
, most flexibly versatile actors in hollywood
- a success story sparked by his critically lauded debut in the 1996 thriller
` primal fear '
. after shockingly bitter roles in
` american history x '
and
, most recently
, david fincher ' s vicious
` fight club '
, a quaint romantic comedy might seem like a peculiar choice
. not in the least
. norton slips into the director ' s chair for tghe first time with
` keeping tje faith '
,
and here his incisive
, resourceful approach helps add additional craft to a surprisingly perceptive screenplay by stuart blumberg
. weighing every aspect
, it isnt unanimously an impressive directorial debut
. in addition
, norton pushes all the right buttons with the sheepish sweetheart brian
, generatting a thoroughly likable screen presence
. stiller
( the zipper guy from
` there ' s something about mary '
) is firm
and funny
, boasting a fully
- ripened comic maturity
. elfman ' s perky repetition can grow tiresome
( such isnt occasionally the case on tv ' s
` dharma
and greg '
)
,
but she seems perfectly rambunctious here
. the remaining cast members offer fine support
, from anne bancroft as jacob ' s animated jewish mom to milos forman as an elderly priest quick to contribute intelligent advice
.
` keeping the faith ' is the perfect date flick
.
.
.
though perfection is not a word to assoicate with the film in general
. there is turbulence during the process ofthe lift
- off
, as numerous failed attempts at establishing the situation cloud the projected comedy ahead
. once the film doens settle in
, it is often funny
and always cheerful
. stiller
, norton
and elfman have created three enormously lovable personalities
. we enjoy their interaction
, understand theri various dilemmas
and feel humbled to realize everything rings perfectly true
. this is excluding the ending
, which isnt acceptable
and all
,
bu seems to lack the charm
and spontaneity of the preceding romantic entaglements
. nonetheless
, a narrowly mishandled finale certainly won ' t wipe the smile off your face
, nor anyone else ' s in the audience
.
` keeping the faith ' is a highly enjoyable romantic comedy
,
although one that is more observant while surveying the questions ofthe lvoe rather than religion
. aww
, what teh hell
. the quality is not quite heaven
- sent
,
but this little charmer could revive our
` faith ' in a potentially tired filmmaking genre
.
