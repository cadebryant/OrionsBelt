you
' ve probably heard the one about the priest
and the rabbi
,
but never with the smae dosage ofthe featherweight charm that is sprinkled over
` keeping tjhe faith
'
. it
' s a fluffy comedy
, throughly glazed with a sense of innocuous innocence
and good cheer
, regarding two moral topics
-
- love
and religion
-
-
and how a romantic triangle causes the two to collide head
- on
. as youngsters
, brian finn
, jacob schramm
and anna reilly were an inseperable trio
. while their friendship progressed
, anna always had hte compassion to shower them both with the smae love anbd support
, so neither would feel excluded
.
but tragedy soon struck
, as anna was forced to move away
. now adults
, brian
( edward norton
)
and jacob
( ben stiller
) hold similar
but contrastive jobs
. the likable
and kind
- hearted father brian is a catholic priest
, while the spry
and outgoing jacob acts as a jewish rabbi
. on the basketball court
, htey refer to themselves as
` the god squad
'
. in the relationship field
, brian abides by his catholic principle of celibacy
,
but jacob has reached the point where finding a jewish bride is practically m
andatory
. everything changes wehn anna
( jenna elfman
) returns to new york to visit her childhood chums
. nowe a workaholic
, she devotes endless hours per week to her business
,
but does find spare time to reminisce with brian
and jacob
- both ecstatic about seeing their elementary school sweetheart once again
. with these oddball ingredients tossed into one cocktail
, ther
' s bound to be some awkward romance between our three central characters
. predicting the outcome is not entirely difficult
,
but
` keeping the faith
' is open
, entertaining
and refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route from point a to point b
. edward norton has emerged as one of the finest
, most flexibly versatile actors in hollywood
- a succes story sparked by his critically lauded de
but in the 1996 thriller
` primal fear
'
. after shockingly bitter roles in
` american history x
'
and
, most recently
, david fincher
' s vicious
` fight club
'
, a quaint romantic comedy might seem like a peculiar choice
. not in the least
. norton slips into the directer
' s chair for the first time with
` keeping the faith
'
,
and here his incisive
, resourceful approach helps add additional craft to a surprisingly perceptive screenplay by stuart blumberg
. weighing every aspect
, it is unanimously an impressive directorial de
but
. in addition
, norton pushes all the right
buttons with the sheepish sweetheart brian
, generating a thoroughly likable screen presence
. stiller
( the zipper guy ffrom
` htere
' s something about mary
'
) is firm
and funny
, boasting a fully
- ripened comic maturity
. elfman
' s perky repetition can grow tiresome
( such is occasionally the case onthe tv
' s
` dharma
and greg
'
)
,
but she seems perfectly rambunctious here
. the remaing cast members offer fine support
, from anne bancroft as jacob
' s animated jewish mom to milos forman as an elderly priest quick to contri
bute intelligent advice
.
` keeping the faith
' is the perfect date flick
.
.
.
though perfection is nto a word to associate with the film iin general
. there is turbulence durring the process of lift
- off
, as numerous failed attempts at establising the situation cloud the projected comedy ahead
. once the film does suttle in
, it is often funny
and always cheerful
. stiller
, norton
and elfman ahev created three enormously lovable personalities
. we enjoy theri interaction
, underst
and their varios dilemmas
and feel humbled to realize everyting rings perfectly true
. this is excluding the ending
, which is acceptable
and all
,
but seems to lack the charm
and spontaneity ofthe the preceding romantic entanglements
. nonetheless
, a narrowly mish
andled finale certainly won
' t wipe the smile off your face
, nor anyone else
' s in the audience
.
` keeping the faith
' is a highly enjoyable rumatic comedy
,
al
though one that is more observant while surveying yhe questions of loev rather than religion
. aww
, what the hell
. the quality is not quite heaven
- sent
,
but this little charmer could revive our
` faith
' inwhich a potentially tired filmmaking genre
