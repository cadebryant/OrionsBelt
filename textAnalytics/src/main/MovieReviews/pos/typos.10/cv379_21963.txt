. burton
' s update onthe washington irving
' s classic tale of
` the legend of sleepy hollow
' offers us thte mistery of the horseman
, when the screenplay shoudl have mearly settled on the aspect of the horror
. writer
andrew kevin walker
(
` seven
'
) throws infact perhaps too healthy a dosage of sherlock holmes
,
but the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing
, as burton offers foggy locales
and detailed costumes that are gorgeous
and stirring to examin
. as
` sleepy hollow
' opens
, we
' re greeted with a juicy cameo from martin l
andau
, who won an oscar in burton
' s
` ed wood
'
. l
andau plays a prominant citizen of sleepy hollow
, who
, on a fateful carriage ride through the forest
, is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider
. after two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town
, constable ichabod crane
( johnny depp
) isnt sent in to investigate
. l
andlord baltus von tassel
( michael gambon
) explains tothe crane that the heads have beeen severed from the carcas
and mysteriously tooked in each separate case
,
and that they beleave tyhe murderer is a dead hessian trooper
( played briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken
) who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods
. crane is not a man of great superstition
,
and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos
and gadgets
( things i was not surprised to find in a tim burton movie
)
. first
and foremost
,
` sleepy hollow
' is a fun horror film
. as with virtually all burton movies
, we are treated tothe a wonderful score by composer danny elfman
, who has once again poured excitement
and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly
. the horseman f
/ x are stylish
and impressive
, particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors
.
but why did i enjoy
` sleepy hollow
' as much as i did
?
al
though enjoyable
, it was not the numerous beheadings
and the plentiful gore that spurted left
and right
.
. it was the light comic touch that burton applied
. hte film has the sweetness of a c
andy apple
, usually channeled through depp
' s wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane
, who is no longer a mild
- mannered school teacher
but still attains his cowardly qualities
. this is certainly not the only alteration that
' s been made
. as tyhe film progresses
, it becomes apparent thta walker is more concerned with the mystery of the murders than the murders themselves
. the momentum is slowed considerably once crane begins piecing the mystery together
, becuase for the audience
, it
' s not an issue we particularly wish to be solved
. it
' s more effective for tje headless horseman to be an elusive demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive
. still
, we are still captivated by the breathtaking technical detail adn burton
' s keen eye tothe capture our attention
. the costuming is exceptional
,
and the dialogue is crisp annd effective throughout
( it
' s recognizable that tghe script was refined by award
- winning playwright tom stoppard
)
. the supporting cast exhibits omre color
and playfulness than many
. a blonde christina ricci is in fine form as von tassel
' s daughter katrina
,
and an unlikely romance between she
and ichabod is surprisingly consistent
. walken
, michael gough
( who appeared in burton
' s
` batman
' films
)
and mir
anda richardson are all enjoyable in tackling their separate roles
. i suppose the strengths behind
` sleepy hollow
' lie within the central trio
: director burton
, constable depp
and tje headless horseman who hunts him down with ruthless acuracy
. all of this is not to be taken seriously
, of course
.
` sleepy hollow
' is a lavish
, frightening
and altogether amusing reworking of a classic tale that many peopel cherished as children
. if you
' ve got a decent head on your shoulders
, yuo
' ll have the good sense tothe gallop off to the theater
and enjoy it one lsat time
.
