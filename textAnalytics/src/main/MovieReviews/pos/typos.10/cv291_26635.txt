reflecting on
" bedazzled
,
" a lively comedy about the devil who seeks to possess the soul of a pathetic loser
, one sinful
thought remains in my mind
. if hell means having to spend an eternity with elizabeth hurley
( who portrays the fiery demon
)
,
then use tath pitchfork anbd point me the way
. with her pouty lips
, irresistible brittish accent
,
and wild display of haute couture
, hurley crackles with naughtiness
and fills your mind with temptation
. it
' s practically impossible to turn this beelzu
- babe down
. her next target is elliot
( brendan fraser
)
, a tech support geek who is clumsy
, awkward
,
and just too eager to please
. to aptly picture him
, you owudl hve tothe remember a saturday night live skit featuring
" steve the copy guy
" who effortlessly irritated his co
- workers with his unpolished social skills
. eugene
, thus
, is loathed
and feared by his co
- workers
, who do their best to stay out of his way
.
yet
, beyond his annoying mannerisms
, he
' s a lovable oaf
. he wishes that he could get closer to allison
( frances o
' connor
)
, a co
- worker with whom he is infatuated
but who has never taken notice of him
.
however
, the odds of him getting together iwth her are about the same as a snowball
' s chance in hell
.
" dear god
,
" he prays
.
" i would give anytying to have that girl in my life
.
" guess who
then shows up
? she makes an offer that is too hard to refuse
.
" seven utterly fabulous wishes for one piddling little soul
.
" there
' s even an excape clause
. if elliot
' s wish doesn
' t go exactly the way he likes
, he need only
' beep
' her
( one guess as to what thte three
- digit number isnt
) adn he gets to start over
. the remainder of tyhe film consists of elliot
' s various fantasies that incorporate his personal desire to have enormous amounts of wealth
, power
, fame annd allison
' s love
.
but wehn he makes sweeping statements such as
" i want to be very
, vyre powerful
and very
, very rich anbd married tothe allison
"
, he
' ll soon learn that the devil is inaddition the details
. fo example
,
(
and we
' ve seen thsi several times in the trailers
)
, he isnt granted his wish
,
but finds out that he
' s a columbian drug lord
and that allison
, while married to him
, hasnt her eyes on someone else
. apparently
, the devil is just as eager to skew his fantasies as she is to possess his soul
. his other wishes also end up with smoe strange
but funny twist that short
- circuits his new life
. soon
, elliot wishes tyhat he had never made that deal
. given the miscihevous nature ofthe hte devil
,
" bedazzled
" has many amusing moments
. a lot of the credit goes to fraser who turns in a great comic performance
. he ably assumes various personas
. his funniest segment is when he wishes that he could be the most sensitive man in thge world
. allison becomes so frustrated with him that she practically urges him to take advantage of her
. hurley also heightens the humor quotient
, especially in the transitional scenes when fraser waits to start his next wish after bailing out of the previous oney
. it
' s clear that she
' s having a good time with it all
.
yet
, hwile the filmmakers work hard at creating funny scenes
, they conspicuously avoid developing the allegorical underpinnings between good adn evil that could have added more heft to this story
.
but that would be playing with fire
. what they
' ve got works
, so you cxan easily accept it fo the pleasant little comedy that it is
.
