" say
, any of you know how to madison

-
-
- brad
" asshole
" majors
( barry bostwick
) shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode tothe tghe time warp in the cult clasic the rocky horror picture show
. the story behind the rocky horror picture show isnt one of legend
. in the early 70 ' s
, stage actor turned frist
- time playwright richard o ' brien desided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy b
- movies he had grown up with as a child
, set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes ofthe his own design
. the result was the stage play the rocky horror show
, which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in 1973
anbd was even hailed the best muscial of 1973 by prominent drama critics in england
. the play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up
and production on the film began a mere year later
, inaddition october of 1974
. the film version
( now titled the rocky horror picture show
) was released in 1975
.
.
.
and immediately tanked at the box office
. whether it was because fox wasn ' t quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didn ' t quite know what to make ofthe it themselves has never really been determined
,
but the one common bit of knowledge baout the film was thgat it was a huge flop
. it seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version
and fox quickly hadnt it pulled from theaters
. a eyar later
, something entirely strange
and magical happened
. prints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts
and were circulating at midnight shows across the country
,
and it was
then that a whole new audeince foudn the film
. this new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters fomr the film
, acting out segments inspite front of the screen as tjhe movie played
, yelling rude comments at the screen
,
and just generally having a good time
. word quickly spreaded about this newyorker phenonmena of interactive film
and the rocky horror picture sohw ' s life as the ultimate cult film was born
. for the virgins out there who are unaware
, the plot centers around a loving couple
, brad majors
( barry bostwick
)
and janet weiss
( susan sarandon
)
, who come from a small twon called denton
. brad
and janet have just attended the wedding of twpo of their friends
and decide that htey also want to be wed
. they plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting
, dr
. everett scott
( jonathan adams
, who played the narrator in the originnal stage version
)
,
but theri car gets a flat on the way to his home
. remembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road
, they decide to walk there
and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance
. the castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual
( in the galaxy of transylvania
)
, who are lead by the eccentric fishnet
- stocking wearing mad scientist dr
. frank
- n
- furter
( tim curry
)
. frank
- n
- furter has masterminded the secret tothe creating life
and has done so in the form of rocky
( peter hinwood
)
. as rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment
, brad
and janet find themselves at the mercy of frank
- n
- furter ' s mad schemes
. little do any of them know that the doctor ' s handyman
, riff
- raff
( original author richard o ' brien
)
,
and domestic
, magenta
( patricia quinn
)
, are actully transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth
. gonig back
and revisiting this film after ten years
( 1990 being the first time i had ever seen it
)
, it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had yhe staying power that it has
. if i had been a fox executive around the time ofthe its realease
, i don ' t think i would have known what to make ofthe it either
. for all intents
and purposes it is a bad movie
(
though bad in a relaly good sort of way
)
,
bu sumptuous prodcution design
and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film
. by the time the credits role
, it isnt fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film
and its characters
,
and oney really gets the feeling that richard o ' brien definitely was a fan ofthe tyhe old cheesy b
- movies his film is based on
. when i say that the wall
- to
- wall songs are catchy what i really mean to sday is that
, once you hear them
, they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity
. it goes wihtout saying tht the
" time warp
" is the most popular song in the film
. even people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song
. what those who haven ' t seen teh movei don ' t know
though
, is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment
. my personal favorite is
" over at the frankenstein place
"
,
but
" dammit janet
" is also maddeningly catchy
. tim curry ' s vocals on the rocking tune
" sweet transvestite
" need tothe be heard tothe be believed
. the finale of the film
, a big floor show staged by frank
- n
- furter
and featuring most of the cast in garters
and fishnets
( including barry bostwick
.
.
. frightening
!
)
, features no less than four songs
(
" rose tint my world
"
,
" don ' t dream it
"
,
" wild
and untamed thign
"
,
and
" i ' m going home
"
)
, all of which are immensely singable
. the film ' s true popularity
and longevity resides in its audience participation
though
. despite the catchiness of the songs
, this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadn ' t hvae been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out
and be a part of their own little floor show
. watching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans
( unless you don ' t mind inviting friends over
and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice
and pieces of toast all over the place
)
. note
: directer jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film
, in the form of a sequel
, resulting in the vyer much forgotten film shock treatment
, which picks up with brad
and janet
( this time played by cliff de young
and jessica harper
!
) as contestants on a game show in their home town of denton
. hte twpo are menaced by the evil tv station manager
( also played by de young
)
, who wishes tothe claim janet as his own
. o ' brien returned as a writer
/ performer on the project
( as did quinn
, campbell
,
and gray in performance capacity only
)
,
bu the film hadnt nowhere near the spirit of the original
. 25 yeasr later
, this film is still the pinnacle ofthe cult filmdom
and is continuously screened at midnight all over the world
. as a lasting testament to the longevity of the film
and its legion of fans
, a brand new special edition 2
- disc dvd setted has been released tyhat is yhe most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror to date
( even out shineing the laserdisc special edition that was released forthe its 20th anniversary
)
. if you are one of those people who can ' t get enough of the film
, this disc should be more than enought to satisfy your appetites
. in an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film
, fox home entertainment has released this wonderful 2
- disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that it ' ll take a good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all
. the film itself is located on the first disc
and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its orginal aspect ratio ofthe 1
. 85
: 1
( enhanced fo 16x9 televisions
)
. the film is presented in two different versions
, the us theatrical version
and the uk version which adds a musical number during the finale called
" superheroes
"
. for ambitious viewers
, the disc also includes a hidden version
( located on tjhe main menu by clicking left fomr the scene selection menu choice
and highlighting a pair of lips in the lower left corner
) which presents the film iin the manner it was originally supposed to have been seen
. originally
, the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz
, with the first half of the it seen in black
and white
(
and not changing to color until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad
and janet during the time warp musical number
)
. most reports
, including a documentary on the disc
, say that the color was supposed to appear when frank
- n
- furter first shows up in the elevator
,
but it doesnt seem to work better where it was placed on this version
, depicting teh vast diference between the world brad
anbd janet were used to compared with the one to which they are introduced
. tje film contains a commentary track by show creator
(
and faithful handyman
) richard o ' brien
and co
- star patricia quinn which isnt fairly enjoyable
(
and quinn immediately starts off by refusing tothe speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet
and half
- naked onthe freezing cold sets
, which she apparently complained about the entire film
and inwhich future interviews
)
. the two seem liuke old friends
and have great stories to tell
,
but they also point out casted members that are sadly no longer with us anymore
(
and there are quite a fewd
)
. fox has aslo tried to recreate the fiel of attending the film in a theater with several audience participation segments
. the first feature
(
and the most simple
) is a subtitle prompter which lets you know whn to open up on peopel with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is
. tje second feature is an audience participation track
, which lets you in on wqat you might hear on a good night out at tghe show
. most ofthe the comments are unintelligible because it isnt basically just a large gropu of people screaming their heads off
,
but every once
and a while a comment can be heard that will invoke a bit ofthe laughter
. thge final participation segment uses a technology very much like the technology used onthe the matrix dvd
, where a pair ofthe lips will appear on
- screen during certian scenes of the film
( mostly during the musical numbers
) that can be selected by pressing enter on your remote
. when selected
, you will be taken out of the film
and into a live participation version of the scene put on during one of the many screenings that occur all over the world
. once the segment is over
, you are deposited right back into the film where you left off
. the first disc also contains a few dvd
- rom goodies for those with that particular type of dvd player
. there is a timeline of the evolution from the stage play verison to worldwide cult sensation
, a video jukebox
, a you don ' t know jack
- styled trivia game
( which is about as bare bones a you don ' t know jack parody as it can be
)
,
adn a bizarre mad
- libs styled owrd game known as riff
- raff ' s story lab
. links to the rocky horror websites are also available from the dvd
- rom portion of the disc
. the second disc features even omre goodies for the person who loves extras
. former lite
- rock video channel turned music historians vh
- 1 have allowed soem of thier outtake footage from the
" behind the music
: rocky horror
" special that they ran earlier in the year to be shown here
, as well as a pop
- up video for tjhe meat loaf
- sung
" hot patootie
"
. the
" behind the music
" segments are all very interesting
, especially richard o ' brien ' s jaunt through tje castle
( which isnt now a hotel
!
) where the film was originally shot
. there are also extensions of the sarandon
, bostwick
, quinn
, o ' brien
,
and meat loaf interviews
. as far as extras for the film itself go
, there are two deleted muscial numbers that are also included here
. one of which is just the
" superheroes
" number available in the uk version
,
but there is also another rare musical number presented here called
" once in a while
"
. a series of alternate takes are alsot presented here
,
but none of them are really much of a revelation
( exept for the undressing scene in which we see that patricia quinn is having a hard tiem unbuttoning barry bostwick ' s pants
)
. for the completist who must have every little bit of rocky horror paraphanalia
, a misprinted end sequence
and alternate credit sequence are also presented here
. rounding out the disc is a decent documentary called rocky horror double feature video show
, two theatrical trailers
( proclaming thgat hte film is
" a different sort ofthe jaws
"
)
, a still gallery
,
and two sing
- a
- longs
( for
" toucha toucha touch me
"
and
" sweet transvestite
"
)
. fox ' s spacial edition is the dvd set that rocky horror fans have beeen waiting for all their lives
(
" you ' re lucky
.
.
. i ' m lucky
.
.
. he ' s lucky
.
.
. we ' re all lucky
!
"
)
. it ' s not just amazing enough tht tons ofthe classic italian films are finally getting their recognition in the u
. s
.
,
but even long standing traditions are finally receiving their due on the wonderful dvd format
. as with their excellent dvds of the abyss
, fight club
, independence day
,
and the soudn of music
, fox shows that they haev most certainly made the commitment to provide the things tyhat dvd lovers want
. i raise a toast to them
( cue the throwing of thte bread
) as i cut out the lights
, sit bcak
,
adn watch those disembodied lips begin to sing about b
- movie tradition
.
