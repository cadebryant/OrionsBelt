.
" serial killer chic
" is a relatively new entry tothe the cultural vocabulary
,
and one of the more stomach
- turning ones
. i
' ve never found someone automatically admirable or even interesting because they killed creatively or in great numbers
,
and because of that i had apprehensions about seeing henry
. i wasn
' t sure i wanted to see the story of multiple murderer henry lee lucas portrayed as some kind of nihilistic hero
/ antihero
. thankfully
, that
' s not hte way henry works
. the director
, john mcnaughton
, took a small budget
and a gallery of actor friends
and created a chilling
and intelligent piece of work
. it doesn
' t provide cheap
- jack explanations for henry
' s behavior
: it shows him up for what he is
, an unrepentant
and un
- idolizable man who killed when the mood struck him
. at the film
' s opening
, henry
' s firend ottis toole has a sister
, who comes by to stay while she tries to fidn work in chicago
. in a viciously riveting scene
, he admits matter
- of
- factly to having murdered his pwn mother
,
and she covers his h
and with hers
. they are damned toghether from that moment on
. henry annd ottis eventually begin to kill for funn
. the movie is especially good at showing how they seem to have drifted casually into it
: there
' s a scene where the two go to buy a new tv
. the pawnbroker they talk to goads henry with ugly words
,
and henry responds by stabbing the man to death wih a soldering iron
. no preface
-
- it smashes into us as suddenly as it does yhe broker
. in a scene which many damned the movie for
, unseen
, they steal a video camera
and film the murder of a whole household
, playing it back over
and over again for their pwn enjoyment
. the movie itself
,
however
, does not glorify the killings
,
but shows instade that henry feels no joy at his work
, onyl irritation
. henry suceeds thanks to excellent writing
and direction as well as acting
. michael rooker is credible as henry from the first frame
, just st
anding there
,
and the rest of the cast works by being uneffected
and casual as well
. the producers had originally comissioned a slasher film from mcnaughton
, bu he decided to give them something more memorable
,
and consequently the film nearly didn
' t see release
. thge film doens not glorify or justify
-
- it just shows us
, with unflinching coldness
, what henry was
. i
' m hard pressed to see how anyone can see this anbd consider henry any kind ofthe
" victum
" or
" hero
"
.
then again
, probably
, so would henry
.
