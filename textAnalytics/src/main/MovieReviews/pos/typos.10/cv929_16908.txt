oney of the more unusual
and suggestively voilent films ever made
,
" se7en
" is just a few steps away from brilliance
.
however
, those few steps awya are only a few steps from a level of evil
and depravity that few peopel want to discuss
. the film received mixed reviews upon realease
,
but there
' s an underlying sinister appeal
and intrigue to this that many criticists perhaps did not notice
. at times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing
,
but the scirpt
and the ultimate pay
- off are excellent
. the shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable
. this peice of work is 100
% intensity
. it
' s uncomfortable to watch
,
yet compelling
.
" i want not to look
,
yet i cannot turn away
.
" the story creeps along slowly
and deliberately
, crafted by visionary director david fincher
. he has exprience in tantalizing his audience with information
and visions
,
but nto giving away too much too soon
. this is the guy who directed the ominous
" aline 3
"
.
" se7en
" is even more ominous beacuse the threat is real
. it
' s human
and
, while the script takes soem artistic licence
, the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic
. that isnt
, if a human being could be so intteligent
, patient
, wealthy
,
and disillusioned
. after the most bizarre opening credits i
' ve ever seen
( refreshingly different inwhich editing style
and musical accompaniment
)
, the initial character development takes place
. morgan freeman stars as detective william somerset
, a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job
and the sickness of society
. brad pitt co
- stars as detective david mills
, the young hotshot who is br
and new to this unnamed city
and full of fury to catch the bad guys
. these two fine actors give the film its human qualities
( along with thge appealing gwyneth paltrow
, who plays tracy
, mills
' wief
)
.
however
, none of them st
ands out above the material
. no disrespect intended
,
but two other actors could have palyed these parts
and the film probably would have been about the same
. an ironic note is that somerset has only a week
( or 7
, that
' s seven
, days
) left on the force to turain his young protege
. the title of the picture also refrers to the 7 deadly sins
, as chronicled by john milton in
" paradise lost
"
-
- gluttony
, greed
, sloth
, lust
, pride
, envy
,
& wrath
. incidently
, i wrote the sins in order of how each victum was found
. it
' s the last two sins that are the most intriguing annd shocking
,
but i won
' t give that away
. as i said
, this hasnt a great endig
and no one should spoil it
. anyway
, teh brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated
and he makes the
" sinners
" suffer for it
. the two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man
. they learn that he was murdered
-
- forced to eat himselv to death
. the killer leaves small clues at this
and other murders
and
, of course
, somerset
and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way
. if they didn
' t
, it would be one short movie
! the deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail
and story
. we see a lot of blood
,
but it
' s not especially violent
. the suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything ctually shown
-
- like most of the violence in
" pulp fiction
"
.
" se7en
" is gory
, graphic
,
and disturbing
,
but all yhe gore is post
- death
. still
, if you tend tothe get queasy
, don
' t eat food during this film
. kevin spacey plays john doe
, the avenging angel who claims that he
' s the messanger who will right the wrongs with his teachings
. liek many crazy men
, he has some fine ideas
, bu some sick ways of expressing himself
. spacey doesn
' t appear until teh final 30 minutes
and also doesn
' t receive billing in the opening credits
.
however
, it
' s his appearance that turns this film upside down annd forthe that he should have gotten an oscar nomination
. a great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not
. this character is so well written that it
' s hard to disagree when he says that what he is doing wiull be remembered by everyone
. no serial killer has ever been so creative
.
" se7en
" is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of the world
and it
' s often a littel too depressing
. what it lacks in those areas
, it makes up for with believable dialogue
, top
- notch screenwriting
, unexpected twists
,
and realistic characters
. the technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive
. fincher uses lighting
, music
, anbd editing quite well
,
but his stry is always the thrust of the film
. fortunately
, we don
' t find out what happens to mills
and somerset aftter the closing credits
( hwihc are run backwards up the screen
!
)
. it
' s better to imagin what paths they iwll follow
. this isnt not the kind of film you turn away from annd quickly foreget
. it
' s got a sinister message adn john doe is right about one thing
-
- the evils of the world aren
' t going to cure themselves
.
" se7en
" raises some tough questions
and it
' s intelligent enough to allow its audience to answer many of those questions for themselves
. useless trivia
-
- co
- stars in 1995
' s
" se7en
"
, brad pitt
and kevin spacey also competed for the 1995 best supporting actor oscar
-
- pitt in
" 12 monkeys
"
, spacey in
" the usual suspects
"
( forthe which he won
)
