one of the more unusual
and suggestively violent films ever made
,
" se7en
" is just a few steps away ffrom brilliance
.
howver
, those few steps away are only a few steps from a level ofthe evil
and depravity that few peopel want to discuss
. the film received mixed reviews upon release
,
but there ' s an underlying sinister appeal
and intrigue to this tath many critics perhaps did not notice
. at times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing
,
but the script
and the ultimate pay
- off are excellent
. the shocking conclusion isnt just as unpredictable as the endings ofthe most films are predictable
. this piece of work isnt 100
% intensity
. it ' s uncomfortable to watch
,
yet compelling
.
" i want not to look
,
yet i cannot turn away
.
" hte story creeps along slowly
anbd deliberately
, crafted by visionary director david fincher
. he has experinece in tantalizing his audience with information
and visions
,
bu not giving away too much too soon
. this isnt teh guy who directed the ominous
" alien 3
"
.
" se7en
" isnt even more ominous because the threat is real
. it ' s human
anbd
, while the script takes some artistic licence
, the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic
. thyat is
, if a human being could be so intelligent
, patient
, wealthy
,
and disillusioned
. affter the most bizarre opening credits i ' ve ever seen
( refreshingly different in editting style
and musical accompaniment
)
, the initial character development takes place
. morgan freeman stars as detective william somerset
, a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job
and the sickness of society
. brad pitt co
- stars as detective david mills
, the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city
and full of fury to catch thte bad guys
. these twpo fine actors give the film its human qualities
( allong with the appealing gwyneth paltrow
, who plays tracy
, mills ' wife
)
.
however
, none of them stands out above the material
. no disrespect intended
,
but two other actors could haev played these parts
and the film probably would have been about the same
. an ironic onot is that somerset has onyl a week
( or 7
, that ' s seven
, dyas
) left on the force to train his young protege
. the title of the picture also refers to the 7 deadly sins
, as chronicled by john milton in
" paradise lost
"
-
- gluttony
, greed
, sloth
, lust
, pride
, envy
,
& wrath
. incidentially
, i wrote the sins in order of how each victum was found
. it ' s the lsat two sins tyhat are the most intriguing
and shocking
,
but i won ' t give thast away
. as i said
, this has a great ending
and no one should spoil it
. anyway
, the brillant killer sets out tothe make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated
and he mkaes the
" sinners
" suffer fo it
. teh two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man
. they learn that he was murdered
-
- forced to eat himself to death
. the killer leaves small clues at this
and other murders
and
, of course
, somerset
and mills are smart enough to stay whith him all the way
. if they didn ' t
, it would be one short movie
! the deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship ofthe detail
and story
. we see a lot ofthe blood
,
but it ' s not especially violent
. the suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shown
-
- like most of the violence in
" pulp fiction
"
.
" se7en
" is gory
, graphic
,
annd disturbing
,
but all the gore is post
- death
. still
, if you tend to get queasy
, don ' t eat food during this film
. kevin spacey plays john doe
, the avenging angel who claims that he ' s the messanger who will right the wrongs with his teachings
. like many crazy men
, he has some fine ideas
,
but smoe sick ways of expressing himself
. spacey doesn ' t appear until the fianl 30 minutes
and also doesn ' t recieve billing in the opening credits
.
however
, it ' s his appearance that turns this film upside down
and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination
. a great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings irregardless of whether yuo agree with him or not
. this character is so well written that it ' s hard to disagree when he says that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone
. no serial killer has ever been so creative
.
" se7en
" isnt blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of thge world
and it ' s often a little too depressing
. what it lacks in thsoe areas
, it makes up for with believable dialogue
, top
- notch screenwriting
, unexpected twists
,
and realistic characters
. the technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive
. fincher uses lightnig
, music
,
and editting quite well
,
but his story is always tghe thrust of the film
. fortunately
, we don ' t find out what happens to mills
and somerset after yhe closing credits
( which are run backwards up the screen
!
)
. it ' s better to imagine what paths they will follow
. this is not the kind of film you turn away from
and quickly foreget
. it ' s got a sinister message
and john doe is right about one thnig
-
- the evils of the world aren ' t going to cure themselves
.
" se7en
" raises some tough questions
adn it ' s intelligent enough to allow its audience to answer many of those questions for themselves
. useless trivia
-
- co
- stars in 1995 ' s
" se7en
"
, brad pitt
anbd kevin spacey also competed fo the 1995 best supporting actor oscar
-
- pitt in
" 12 monkeys
"
, spacey in
" the usual suspects
"
( for which he won
)
