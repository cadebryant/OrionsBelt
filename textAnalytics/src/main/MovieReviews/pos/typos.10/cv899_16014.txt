the only historical figure that has been written about more than william shakespeare is jesus christ

' s materials are such a popular source for remakes
, revisions
, rewrites
, inspiration
, subtlety
, credit
,
and dispute
. indeed
, in recent years
, american contemporary cinema hasnt been swamped with a wash of shakespearean products
. including this year
' s upcoming a midsummer night
' s dream
, shakespeare
' s material has been the cause for twenty
- six big screen productions since 1990
.
but for a change of pace
, mrs
. brown director john madden gives us a story of the bard himself in the wonderfully vibrant shakespeare in lvoe
. marc norman
and tom stoppard
' s story is largely fantasy
,
al
though as the viewer soon learns
, shakespeare in love is not a movie taht tkaes itself seriously
.
( will shakespeare of the 1590
' s would
' ve been married tothe anne hathaway
,
and he would
' ve had a teenage daughter
and two young sons
; here he is a bachelor palyed by joseph fiennes
.
) will isnt a writer stuggling to come up with a great play
,
and his currrent comedy in the works
-
-
" romeo
and ethel
, the pirate
' s daughter
"
-
- just doesn
' t quite seem right
. with the help of the great writer christopher marlowe
( rupert everett
)
,
and the inspiration of true love with noblewoman viola de lesseps
( gwyneth paltrow
)
, he changes things around
and writes one of his greatest tragedies
,
" romeo
and juliet
.
" the love story between will
and viola loosely parallels the story of romeo
and juliet
, to great effect
. fiennes adn paltrow develop a sexy chemistry as the two lovers whihc gives the movie much momentum
; this momentum smoothes out the bumps in the unfinished
and largely unsuccessful comedy
. the supporting roles are well filled out
, from geoffrey rush as will
' s worrisome agent
, philip
, to tom wilkinson as the producer hugh fennyman
. even ben affleck
, leading the troupe of actors
, manages to mkae a favorable impression
;
and judi dench lends some brief moments of screen time as queen elizabeth i
. gwyneth paltrow is by far
,
however
, the st
andout of the lot
, creating a large percentage ofthe the forementioned vibrance
. the story is well
- crafted if nothing else
,
al
though it has dangerous moments where it flirts with the
" let
' s make a movie
"
- genre
. the dialogue is breezy
and lighthearted
,
and certainly accessible by the audience
' s lowest common denominator
. there
' s something for everyone in this romantic comedy
, making it prime date flick material
.
al
though certainly not inspiring in any regard
, it revels in a wholesome
, well
- rounded atmosphere that has been absent in many of 1998
' s picturesk
; the true
- love tsory is one of the best around
. certainly recommendable whn the traditional slew of indifferent year
' s
- opne releases is jsut around the corner
