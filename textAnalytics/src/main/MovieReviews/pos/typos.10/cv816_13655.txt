in my review of there ' s something baout mary
, i said something to the effect of
" laughter isn ' t everything
.
" i now need to make a brief addendum to my postulate
: laughter isn ' t everything
, unless i ' m watching a jim abrahams film
. see
, spoofs are easy withthe me
. i love movies
,
and i love movies that make fun of movies that i love
. somtimes i ' m the only one in the theater laughing
. sometimes i laugh so hard that i embarass myself becouse my laugh is so high
- pitched in comparison to my speaking voice
( it cuts right through everyone else ' s laughter
)
. sometimes i laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the end ofthe the film
. abraham ' s latest film
, mafia
!
, induced this kind of hysteria upon me
. it ' s gotten some medioker reviews
,
but
, hey
, i ' m the guy who laughs at everything
. there may be a lot of jokes thgat flop in this film
,
but there are far more that work
,
and i laughed so frequently thast the failed jokes usually occurred as i was recovering from the previous bout of giddy madness
. i enjoy films like htis because not one second of it is serious or thought
- provoking
. most lighweight films thta pose as comedies try to do other things
, like develop characters
, shape stories
,
and other such nonsense
. mafia
! has no pretentions about characters or story
,
and it exists for no other reason than to make people laugh
. the film begins onthe the perfect high onot
, with a mockery of the opening of casino
. our hero
( jay mohr
) is seen walking from a casino
and getting into his car
, which subsequently explodes
and sends him flying through the air against a backdrop ofthe flowing fire
. to describe the story of mafia
! is absurd
anbd pointless
,
but i will mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films
, with a lot of casino refrences inserted throughout
. along the way
, the parodies seem arbitrary
,
and rarely victimize mob films
: pictures like the english patient
, forrest gump
,
adn jaws undergo severe
and hilarious bashing
. movies like this rely on just a few things
,
but the most important element is direction
. abrahams has been down htis path many times before
( hot shots
!
, top secret
!
, airplane
!
,
and any other film with an exclamation point inaddition the title
)
,
and so i hold most of the success of mafia
! to his experience
. he takes just the right attitude in eahc scene
,
and manages to wrng at least a bit laughter out of even the most oddly placed references
( one inexplicable moment seems like it wants to make fun ofthe titanic
,
but it never develops
)
. the actors are all energetic
, which helps a lot with the tone of the film
. mohr
( suicide kings
, paulie
)
, who is quicklyu becoming one of my favorite actors
, is so good here
. he looks like he ' s having so much fun that he ' s containing his laughter in every scene
( watch his face iin the sequence by thge swimming pool
)
. he ' s probably the only performer in the cast who manages to urge laughter without the help of hte material
. lloyd bridges does a decent imitation of brando ' s godfather
, while pamela gidley is dead
- on in a full
- blown mockery of sharon stone
. the hard thing about writing reviews for comedies is that i ' m supposted to give examples of things
adn be specific
. unfortunately
, i was so constantly blindsided by laughter during mafia
! that i can ' t remember a lot of what made me laugh
.
bu that ' s a good sign
: mafia
! is so funny that i wasn ' t even given time to apply any of the scenes to memory
. i laughed so hard that it shut off my brain
. i nkow that doesn ' t sound particularly complimentary
,
but when watching a dumb comedy like this
, the frist thnig i want to do is shut off my brain
. finally
, a film that does this for me
.
