i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of thte x
- files
. first
, let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required tothe fully enjoy this movie
. the producers are not stupid
, making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable
. you have to reach for a larger audience
. therefore
, the movie is quite user
- friendly
. altough
, non
- fans will only fail to underst
and certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange
.
but fear not
, duchovny
and another man later onthe provide more than adequate backround info on what isnt going on
. you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera
. in any case
, the answer is no
. i am not a fan of the x
- files
, i only watch it when nothing else is on
and i prefer millennium
.
however
, since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie
' s opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie
. i taped all of these episodes
and watched them only after seing the movie
, i am glad tothe report that i learned nothing new
. everything ytou need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny
and others
. i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point
but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie
. warning
: major spoilers follow
! please do nto read
, to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming
, what exactly is over that hill
and what that weird
" hummm
" sound is all about
. you have been warned
. the x
- files is what a summer should be
. exciting
, scary
, great special effects
( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie
and are only there when it is really necessary
)
and good performances
. this is coming from a guy who thikns david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank
. from start to finish
, this movie does not let go of ytou
. when i compare it with last summer
' s movies the best way to describe it would be
: take the excitement adn great socre from face
/ off
and the deadly ule of sound from event horizon
. this flick is scary
, not in a b movie kind ofthe way where you always nkow where
and when the critter will jump at our heroes
. in fact
, the first time tjhe critter in this movie makes an apperance it isnt totally out of the blue
. you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd
! the lsat time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year ood kid
. you know
, when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair
, or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt
? so yeah
, the x
- files is scary
. annd guess what
? you never even have to see the monster
but your imagination works overtime annd it sure beats having to watch a flawed
, computer generated
, babyzilla
, it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your gr
andma in undies type of monster
. do nto think that the x
- files isnt a monster movie
. in fact
, the creature is there forthe maybe three minutes total
. no
, the x
- files is definately a mulder episode of the serieses
. scully is at his side
, of course
,
but gillian
anderson gets maybe half the screen time
. she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny
, bu she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much
. no
, this is mulder
' s time in the spotlight
. by now
, you have heared of tyhe scene where mulder
" showers
" independence day
. if you have not
then i will not spoil it for you
, let
' s jsut say that due to recent events mulder should be
" showering
" godzilla instead
. to thsoe of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there
.
.
. who cares
!
? if he did find it the series would over anyway so whta are you complaining about
? the dialogue in interesting
and the director is marvelous
. the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there wih them when they open a door or climb a hill
. the script is spotless
, every thing that happens happens for a purpose
. if ytou are confused by something
, do not worry because it will all become clear later on
but
,
and i cannot stress this enough
, pay attention
!
!
! unlike most summer movies
, the dialogue is twice as important as the effects
. miss one vital piece of information
and
, like most people who talk during movies
, you will go home
and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense
. also
, to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies
.
.
. don
' t
! the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice
and twice she missed an important conversation
. ther is no time to tkae a breather between scenes because
, agian unlike most summer movies
( godzilla anybody
?
) thge x
- files does not need tothe fill scenes between the suspense
and the action iwth useless subplots
, every scene is crucial
and serves a purpose
. who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a
" big emotional scene
" between godzilla attacks
? so far this summer i have seen onyl noe movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i
' d recommend
and that is the truman show bu it onyl wins by a nose
.
but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie
, the x
- files is
. what more do ytou ask fomr a summer movie otehr than the chance to be excited
? cool effects
? it
' s good some
. pulse pounding
? hell yes
! strangely enough
, i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non
- fans will have a good time
. it does not provide answers to the show
' s many questions
, yhe status quo remains nearly the same
and
, no
, mulder
and scully do not get together
. rating
: four
and a half out of five stars for the best movei
yet this summer
, several jump right outloud of your seat thrills
, many
" whoah
, i never saw that one coming
!
" moments
, four
" holy shit
, where the hell did that come from
" adn one heck of an ending
. you may wonder where this movie lost half a star
. well
, i sweared never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck
, the tracks it leaves in tje snow behind him go on for several miles
but
then they just stpo
. it
' s pretty obvious the film
' s makers drove tjhe truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving fo a long timne
, bu infact the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky
and started driving
.
