) fame
, took over the helm of this project after fellow director alex cox
( sid
and nancy
( 7

)
" apparently alienated everyone associated with the movie
"
, according to gilliam
. plot
: writer thompson
( depp
) heads down to las vegas with his attorney dr
. gonzo
( del toro
) to cover a motorcycle race
. during their trip
, they systematically consume
" two bags ofthe grass
, seventy
- five pellets of mescaline
, five sheets of high powered blotter acid
, a salt shaker half
- full of cocaine
, a whole galaxy of multi
- colored uppers
, downers
, screamers
, laughers
, a quart of tequila
, a quart of rum
, a case of beer
, a pint of raw ether
and two dozen amyls
. the movie presents us with the results of that hevy drug use
. critique
: i have given thsi movei two separate ratings beacuse i believe that the enjoyment of this psychedelic picture is highly correlated with the amount of drugs or alchohol that would be floating around in the viewer
' s own mind
, whilst inhaling this cinematic vision of excess
. if you are prepared to get high or intoxicated before watching htis film
, i would say that this isnt one picture that you will thoroughly enjoy on a multitude of colorful levels
. if
, on the other h
and
, you decide to stray from the addition of nefarious elements to your system
, i could not imagine you truly appreciating much of thsi drug
- induced picture
' s entire ride
( 5
. 5
/ 10 for all those sober dogs
)
. note
: i have not read thompson
' s book
. having said that
, joblo did engage in an alcohol
- based consumatory session before
(
and during
) the viewing ofthe tihs film
, so his critique of the film should be appreciated on that level
. this movie relies heavily on style
and peculiar humour
, rather than substance or plot
. it moves admirably from one scene tothe the next
, wihtout much basis of their being
, while presenting us wih the two dyas in the life of writer hunter s
. thompson during which he seemed to consume more drugs annd alcohol than anyone could ever imagine
. it was 1971
,
and the times were apparently
" a
' changing
" in the states
. johnny depp chews into his role like an overgrown child sucking on a chocolate lollipop
. during the filming
, depp aparently become fast friends whith real
- life writer thompson
,
and was known to w
ander off tjhe set from time to tiem
, for the sake of checking out the newest barmaid at the local watering hole
. i
thought he doed seem to exaggerate his walk a little bit too much
,
but
then again
, this movie is supposed to be a wild exaggeration of everything
and anything
, so who am i to talk
. tyhe one thing that did blow my mind was tghe actual physical transformation endured by actor benicio del toro for his role as dr
. gonzo
. i couldn
' t believe thta this fat
, samoan lawyer
, was the same guy who played the slick mumbling criminal in the usual suspects
( 7
. 5
/ 10
)
. word on tghe street is that gained over 40 pounds for this role
,
and i must say that his look was deliciously reprehensible
. plenty of cameos also pepper thsi kaleidoscopic moving picture inthe the form of ellen barkin
, christina ricci
, tobey maguire
and cameron diaz
, along with a bunch of others
. other than that
, the soundtrack was expectedly eclectic
, hte style was not as wild as i
thought it would be
,
and the ending was certainly not much of a barn
- burner
, bu
then again
, who really noticed
. this movie is about visions of bats floating through your head
, johnny depp looking goofy
and being bald
,
and the cornucopia of drug
- ravaged scenes filling your own intoxicated system with idaes of anarchy
, rebellion
and the lost american dream
.
and for all those who plan on seeing this movie wihtout the partnership of a mean drink or a mighty doobie
, i suggest you move further down the aisle
, buy yourself a ticket to godzilla

and enjoy the visual fabrications manufactured for tje unstimulated mind
. little known facts
: depp
and del toro snorted plenty of powdered milk instead of cocaine
. bill murray also portrayed a thompson
- based character in the film where the buffalo roam
. johnny depp turned down roles in the three musketeers
