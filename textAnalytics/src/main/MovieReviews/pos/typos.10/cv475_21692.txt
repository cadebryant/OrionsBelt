. running time
: 130 mintues bieng a huge fan of kevin smith
, i was expecting a lot out of his newest project ' dogma '
. it might just be kevin ' s best wokr to date
. it ' s very funny with smart
and foul
- mouthed dialogue while unexpectedly it has a serious undertone to it
and besides going against god
and jesus christ
, it actually tries to tell people that there is such a thnig rather than that there isn ' t
. in 1994 a little
$ 27
, 000 movie premeired at sundance
. this little film was called ' clerks '
and this littel film whent on to become a huge video sensation
. you really can ' t meet a person on thsi green earth who has not seen ' clerks '
. it was hailed by critics as one of the best movies of the year
and soon a sequel is coming
. in 1995 kevin made another movie ' mallrats ' that flopped horribly
, thought it was not the best movie ever made it was a pretty good little flick
. it was panned by criticists
but hailed by audiences
and in 1997 ' chasing amy ' came out
and was kevin ' s biggest success to date
. now in 1999 we get a great little movie by the name of ' dogma '
. wow
! whta a cast
. ok here is the plot in this movie
: linda fiorentino plays a regular woman who works at an abortion clinic
. one day at her house metatron
( the voice of god
) appears at her house much to her surprise
and tells her that she must stop two fallen angels
( matt damon
and ben affleck
) from getting back into heaven by ways of a church
. ok now get tihs
, she is told to find two prophets
: one who talks a lot
and one who doesn ' t
,
however she gets jay
and silent bob instead
( who give us great performances
)
. now on her way to new jersey with jay
adn silent bob to try
and stop the two angels the 13th apostle falls outloud of the sky
( chris rock
)
and helps guide her to find theese angels
. salma hayek plays serendipity who also helps her out along her way
. azrael
( jason lee
) who is a demon is trying to help the two angels out so that they can win
. bethany
( linda fiorentino
) has to now use yhe help of all these people to try
and stop yhe angels befoer they cheat their way back to heaven leading to a violent
and bloody end that will make you htink twice about your faith
. what a movei
, it is everything rolled into one
: an offensive
, offbeat
, smart
annd sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at hte end
,
and ends up being a feel
- good movie
. who would have known kevin hadnt such a soft side on him that could make us know that he isnt a faithful person himself
. now for those of you who get offended wiht this movie really should not take it tothe heart
. yes it may target the catholic community
and bash them a lot
,
but it also seems to rether than go against god
and heaven
, it actually goes with god
and kevin gives a message that there is a god
. this review may soudn confusing at frist
but really the only way to understand it is to see this excellent movie
. kevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy
and gives us some great characters with not too much background or studdy
and rather we start to know the characters as we watch the movie
. of course the best
(
and funniest
) of them all is the only duo in ihstory that have made me fall outloud ofthe my chair laughing
and that my firends are jay
and silent bob
. probably the best characters in movies that i like
. tje star
- studder casted is amazing
and has some other cameos by george carlin
, jeanne garafolo
adn so may more that we start to lose track after a while
. the script was writen by kevin smith with many f ' words in there of course
and a strong emphasis on sexual talk
but he also seems to concentrat on waht is important rather that what isn ' t
and makes us laff at the same time as we think
. chris rock gives a hillarious performance
and gets into his character very well
, with some classic lines
. linda fiorentino is jsut perfect forthe her role
and makes us believe that she really is who she is
. of course jason mewes
and kevin smith do a great job as jay
and silent bob with some priceless lines from jay
( as well as silent bob
)
. alan rickman
, jason lee
, salma hayek round out the cast with matt damon
and ben affleck in the starring roles
. being oscar winners for the classic ' good iwll hunting ' they give great performances here again
but matt damon seems just a little held back
and to me did nto give it all he could
. ben
however was all out
and got very much into his character as well as the story
. the movie ' s only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines
and soem slow parts to go along with it
.
however the direction by kevin
and the script by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members
, ' dogma ' stands as a new clasic
and i htikn i can safely compare it to ' clerks '
. while being funny at times
, in the end it becomes a sereous movei with an important message that some may not agree with
but can ' t deny it
. ' dogma ' will offend people
, especially deeply religous people
,
but for those of you who are open minded
and want to see some very funny material
then this is the movie for you
. all kevin smith fans must see
!
