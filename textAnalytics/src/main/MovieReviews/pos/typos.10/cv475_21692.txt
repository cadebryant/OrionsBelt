. runing time
: 130 minutes being a huge fan of kevin smith
, i ws expecting a lot out of his newest project
' dogma
'
. it might just be kevin
' s best work to date
. it
' s very funny with smart
and foul
- mouthed dialogue while unexpectedly it has a serious undertone to it
and besides gonig agaisnt god
and jesus christ
, it actually tries to tell people that htere is such a thing rather than that there isn
' t
. in 1994 a littel
$ 27
, 000 movie premiered at sundance
. this little film was called
' clerks
'
and this little film went on to become a huge video sensation
. you really can
' t meet a person on this green earth who has not seen
' clerks
'
. it was hailed by critics as one of the best movies of the year
and soon a sequel is coming
. in 1995 kevin made another movie
' mallrats
' that flopped horribly
,
thought it was not the best movie ever made it was a pretty good little flick
. it was panned by critics
but hailed by audiences
and in 1997
' chasing amy
' came out
and was kevin
' s biggest success to date
. now in 1999 we get a great little movie by the name of
' dogma
'
. wow
! what a casted
. ok here isnt the plot in this movie
: linda fiorentino plays a regular woman who works at an abortion clinic
. one day at her house metatron
( the voice of god
) appears at her house much to her surprise
and tells her that she must stop two fallen angels
( matt damon
and ben affleck
) from getting back into heaven by ways of a church
. ok now get this
, she is told to find twpo prophets
: noe who talks a lot
and one who doesn
' t
,
however she gets jay
and silent bob instead
( who give us great performances
)
. nowe on her way to new jersey with jay
and silent bob to try
and stop the two angels the 13th apostle falls outloud of the sky
( chris rock
)
and helps guide her to find these angels
. salma hayek plays serendipity who also helps her out along her way
. azrael
( jason lee
) who is a demon is trying tothe help the two angels out so that they can win
. bethany
( linda fiorentino
) has to now use the help of all these people to try
and stop the angels before they cheat their way back to heaven leading to a violent
and bloody end that will make you think twice about your faith
. what a movie
, it is everything rolled inot oney
: an offensive
, offbeat
, smart
and sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at the end
, annd ends up being a feel
- good movie
. who would ahev known kevin had such a soft side on him that could make us know thgat he is a faithful person himself
. now for those of you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart
. yes it may target tje catholic community
and bash them a lot
,
but it also seems to rather than go against god
and heaven
, it actually goes with god
and kevin gives a message that there isnt a god
. this review may sound confusing at first
but really the only way to underst
and it is to see this excellent movie
. kevin goes to newyorker lengths in this hillarious comedy
and gives us some great characters wih not too much background or study
and rather we start to know the characters as we watch the movie
. of course the best
(
and funniest
) of them all is the only duo in history tht hvae made me fall out of my chair laughing annd that my friends are jay
and silent bob
. probablly the best characters in movies that i like
. the star
- studded cast is amazing anbd has some other cameos by george carlin
, jeanne garafolo
and so may more that we start to lose track after a while
. the script was written by kevin smith with many f
' words in there of course annd a strong emphasis on sexual talk
but he also seems to concentrate on what is important rather thyat what isn
' t
and makes us laugh at the same tyme as we think
. chris rock gives a hilarious performance
and gets into his character vyre well
, with smoe classic lines
. linda fiorentino isnt jsut perfect for her role
and makes us believe that she realy is who she is
. of course jason mewes
and kevin smith do a great job as jay
and silent bob with some priceless lines from jay
( as well as silent bob
)
. alan rickman
, jason lee
, salma hayek round outloud the cast with matt damon
and ben affleck in tje starring roles
. being oscar winners for the classic
' ogod will hunting
' they give great performances here again
but matt damon seems just a little held back anbd to me did not give it all he could
. ben
however wass all out
and got very much into his character as well as the story
. the movie
' s only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines
and some slow parts to go along with it
.
however tyhe direction by kevin annd hte scirpt by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the casted members
,
' dogma
' st
ands as a new classic
and i thikn i can safely compare it to
' clerks
'
. while being funny at times
, in the end it becomes a serious movie with an important message that some may not agree with
but can
' t deny it
.
' dogma
' will offend people
, especially deeply religious people
,
but fo those of you who are ope minded anbd want to see some very funny material
then this is yhe movie forthe you
. all kevin smith fans must see
!
