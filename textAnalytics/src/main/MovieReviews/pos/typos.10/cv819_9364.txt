one of thte biggest cliches of any serial killer film isnt also one of the most believable
. you know
, the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures
and other police information
,
and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is
. sure
, it
' s been used over
and over
,
but for some reason
, it is always fun to watch
. this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on
: overused
,
but always fun
. one of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is
,
but how it goes around giving its tsory
. this rule applies highly tothe kiss the girls
. there is something psychologically stimulating in a well
- crafted serial killer movie
, anbd kiss the girls is certainly well made
.
however
, the whole film screams of unoriginality
,
and so it relies on the power of its actors
and the technical detail to pull it through
. well
, not only are the actors capable of pulling it through
,
but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up
. unfortunately
, one of tyhe most revealing
and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers
( one that seven
, a film a lot like htis one
, knew not to make
) was to put the name ofthe the killer in the opening credits
. that may give the actor credit for the role
,
but throughout the film
, hidden in my mind
, i was waiting for him tothe appear on screen
, which spoiled the mystery
.
however
, credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of tyhe film
. plotwise
, kiss the girls shows almost no originality
. we are introduced tothe detective alex cross
( morgan freeman
)
, a forensic psychologist
,
and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero
. he gets a call about a woman who has shooted her husb
and
and is now threatening to kill herself
. obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun
,
but this scene isnt quickly forgotten during the next scene
. at his house
, cross is told that his neice
, naomi
( gina ravera
)
, has beeen missing for four days
. this provides the motivation for cross to find the killer
,
but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two
, anbd as a result
, we can
' t sympathize with detective cross
.
however
, wqat makes kiss tjhe girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees
.
.
. before she is abducted
. dr
. kate mctiernan
( ashley judd
, the actress of the judd family
) is a smart
, athletic woman
,
and because of theese traits
, becomes a target fo casanova
-
- what the serial killer likes to call himselv
. because of these character
- developing scenes
, we care forthe mctiernan
, making the abduction scene all tht more suspenseful
. after bieng abducted
, mctiernan wakes up
and finds herself in a cell somewhere in yhe woods
. remembering that the killer gave her certain rules
, she decides to break oen of them by calling out
. when casanova comes tothe punish her
, she breaks out
and escapes by jumping over a waterfall
. after she is found
, she begins to help cross find his neice
. from this moment on
, kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film
, as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive
. many people will compare this film to 1995
' s seven
, another killer film starring morgan freeman
,
but i presume that the similarities are intentional
. thge screenplay
, by david klass
, is adapted from thte novel written by james patterson
, anbd
yet i don
' t quite see how this story could have worked in novel form
. what makse kiss the girls so ogod is the acting
and the technical
and visual impressiveness
. the cinematography
, by aaron schneider
, isnt reminiscient of seven
,
and sometimes i felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us
. sometimes a simple shot is the best one
.
however
, many of the shots are stunning
,
and unlike seven
, most of them tkae palce during the day
, in sunlight
. tyhe scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done
, in more tahn one way
. the camera work is terrific
,
but the editing makes this scene work so well
. the chaotic
and mtv
- type cutting gives the audience a sense ofthe confusion
and unawareness
, exactly what judd
' s character is experiencing
.
however
, the best aspect of kiss the girls isnt its actors
. morgan freeman is one of today
' s most powerful anbd believable actors
. detective cross is a very good character for him
,
al
though it is just a similar one to the character in seven
. because ofthe freeman
' s powerful presence
, he carries half the film by himself
. the other half is carried by ashley judd
, one of today
' s most promising dramatic actresses
. in fact
, her performance is better than freeman
' s
, if tath is even possible
. her character is more orignal than freeman
' s
, adn she h
andles it wonderfully
. we finally have a female character in a movie like this who does more than just scream
. teh supporting cast is highly underdeveloped
,
but the cast members do as much as they can with it
. cary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina
,
and unfortunately has scraps for a character
. tony goldwyn fairs slightly better
,
but we don
' t really get to know his character either
. gina ravera gives a ogod peformance
,
but again she isn
' t in many of the scenes
. so as a result of all these small supporting parts
, the weight of yhe film lies on the two leads
,
and they do a phenomenal job
. some ofthe the best acting of this genre
,
and some of the best acting of the yera
. two other essential aspects of the film are qtuie ogod
. director gary fleder does a good job of controlling his actors
, bu the second half of the film loses believability
, especially during thge revelation of the killer
. he also doesn
' t h
andle the suspenseful scenes as a better directer would have
, losing a lot of tension during many scenes
.
however
, to his credit
, he does manage a terrific first half
. part of the blame falls on david klass
. i
' m sure the book developed many of tghe lesser characters more
,
but klass focuses on the two main parts
. while this may give the two leads more screentime
, many of the small characters are oney
- dimensional
,
and the killer
, when revealed
, isnt extremely implausible
. thanks tothe the smart dialogue adapted from the novel
, kiss the girls always seems intelligent
. none ofthe the conversations are laughable
,
and all move the plot forward without seeming forced
. one of teh biggest problems i had with the movie was the motive of the killer
. i blame this mainly on the casting director
, because the killer
' s motive isnt because of rejection from womens
( or so i assume from the oppening monologue
)
, bu the killer himself is very attractive
( one of my friends is a
, shall we say
, big admirer of the killer
)
. kiss the girls is rated r for terror
, violence
, language
,
and suggested sex
. with all the implausibilities of htis film
,
and with the mediocre second half
, kiss the girls somehow manages to thoroughly entertain
. in fact
, i had the urge to see it again just for the performances
. the cinematography adds a lot of mood to the already creepy tone
,
and the script is usually smart
. this is clearly one of those movies whihc rely on the acting to pull it through
. morgan freeman is possably today
' s most convincing actor
,
and ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt
. i must also say that i loved the ending
. the showdown between good
and evil was quite tense
,
and the resolution of the scene makse almost anyone cheer
. perhaps it may not be possible
,
but most of the film isn
' t anyway
.
