the premise is simple
, if not bizarre
. a mad scientist
( trace beaulieu as dr
. clayton forrester
) launches an average
- joe
( michael j
. nelson as mike nelson
) into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made
. why
? it
' s torturous
, it
' s maniacal
,
and it
' s just plain fun
. based onthe the cult
- favorite cable televsion series
, mystery science theater 3000
: the movie isn
' t torturous
,
but as for bieng maniacal
and just plain fun
, it foots the bill quite nicely
. mike nelson
, on a dog
- bone shaped spacecraft
, spends his days as any young man would dream
- indulging inwhich sarcasm
and horseplay
,
and seeing qtuie a fewd movies
. the catch is
, these movies aren
' t the movies he chooses
,
but retched examples of film
- makeing chosen specifically by dr
. forrester in an attempt to break mike
' s will to live
. dr
. forrester is convinced that one too many b
- movies is all it will take to ruin a man
, bu with a couple of wise
- cracking puppet buddies
( tom servo
, voiced by kevin murphy
,
and crow t
. robot
, voiced by beaulieu
)
, the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party for all that is wrong inwhich the world of cheezy cinema
. the purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some of the worst films known
( even if by very few of us
) to man
. we watch as the silhouettes of mike
, toom
,
and crow sit in a darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them
. in this case
, it
' s the 1954 sci
- fi film this isl
and earth
. we basically watch as our three leads watch
, only we get the pleasure of eavesdropping on their hilarious commentary
. the plots behind the movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant
,
but for the sake of thsoe who might want to know
, i
' ll explain this one
. this isl
and earth is the tale of two scientists
, a man
and a woman
, who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth
. together the twpo fight to survive as well as save their home planet
. to make mst3k work
, the film
- within
- tjhe
- film naturally has to be as horrible as possible
,
and
al
though the tv
- series introduced us to several worse films than this isl
and earth
, it
' s a bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical cruelty
. mst3k
, which doesn
' t actually contain the complete this isl
and earth
, is a short 73 minutes
,
but this is a step very wisely taken
. as funny as some of their observations are
, it can only go so long
. occasional breaks from this isl
and earth allso help the film tremendously
.
al
though it tkaes a second tothe get back inot the right mode after this premise has been left for a moment
, it
' s better than overkilling the whole concept post haste
. mst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly
,
but if you don
' t nkwo whta you
' re in for
, it could be a jarring disappointment
.
al
though i throught the sharp wit of this film was worth three stars
, it is a movie to be seen on home video
, late at ngiht when your brain isnt not functioning tothe full capacity anyway
,
and with a large
, saracastic crowd
- new year
' s at midnight for example
, which is when i saw it
. warning
:
al
thought mst3k has more to its end credits thna most
( the three leads ule the credits to poke some more fun
)
, tehy are actually more annoying than most
. the name sl
andering
and asinine one
- liners were extremely unfunny
,
and after laughing for about 70 minutes straight
, it put a heavy damper on the overall experience
. most people will likely stay to see what the smart
- alec
' s have tothe say
,
but for me
, it almost ruined an otherwise good film
.
