you
' ve heard all the hype
. you
' ve seen all their faces
- natalie portman
( the professional
) as queen amidala
, liam neeson
( schindler
' s list
) as qui
- gon jinn
, ewan mcgregor
( trainspotting
) as obi
- wan kenobi
,
and jake lloyd
( jingle all the way
) as young anakin skywalker
. if you
' ve read any reviews
, you
' ve also propably herad that this movie fails to live up to the magic
and humanity of the first trilogy
. you also may have heard that this one
' s too kiddie
- friendly
, annd doesn
' t have enough content for adults
. believe teh hype
. the effects are stunning
, the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic
, thte lightsaber duels are amazing
,
and queen amidala
' s sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth
.
but there
' s something missing here
,
and it isn
' t budget or effects
- it
' s everything money
* can
' t
* buy
. the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad
- stroked
and flat charactors
. the most successful at this is liam neeson who
, as qui
- gon jinn
, a jedi master to young obi
- wan kenobi
, has quiet dignity
and a wise
, comm
anding presence
. he is the anchor to this movie
, as he is the one character who george lucas apparantly spent smoe time fleshing out
. portman
' s queen amidala
and mcgregor
' s obi
- wan kenobi don
' t fare nearly so well
. amidala
, hte future mother ofthe luke anbd leia
and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation
(
?
!
?
)
, comes off as stoic
, stilted
and caricatured
( it appears as
though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life
)
.
and obi
- wan
,
al
though mcgregor makes him very endearing
, has so little screen time that he
' s nothing
but a robin to qui
- gon jinn
' s batman
.
however
, mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight
and humanity
, adn he does a good job
. he also absolutely nails alec guiness
'
( obi
- wan in episode 4
- 6
) scottish accent
,
and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise
. in fatc
, lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowlege quite a bit
,
and that
' s one of the problems with this film
. i would never call myself a
" star wars
" fan
- especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic theese days
-
but i
' ve always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america
.
however
, if ytou are the one person inaddition america who
* hasn
' t
* seen the films at all or even recently
, or who doesn
' t bother to brush
- up on the names of obscure characters
, ytou may be hopelessly lost
. for example
, one ofthe the film
' s main
( nefarious
) characters is senator palpatine
. for thsoe of you nto recently steeped inthe
" star wars
" trivia
, emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader
' s master in
" return of the jedi
"
and
" empire strikes back
.
" so
, obviously
, his appearance in
" phantom menace
" is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series
, thus making his role here more meaningful
. a lot of the movie is like that
. r2
- d2
and c
- 3po make token appearances
,
and it
' s obvious that lucas is banking onthe tje audience
' s pre
- existing fondness for them
.
.
. because he doesn
' t do much to add tothe it in any way
. same goes for jabba the hutt
, who doesn
' t look as much mean here as he does corpulent
and lazy
. even
* planets
* make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film
- tatooine
( thte desert world where luke growed up
)
, coruscant
( the cloud city from
" empire strikes back
"
)
,
and alderaan
( leia
' s home planet
- which we never actually see
- that gets blown up in
" star wars
"
) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing
. what
' s the result of tying so many plot points
and characters to future films
? the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty
. there
' s no meat
- no substance
- that makes yuo want to love tghe characters as they are
, not as they will be
. another problem is that there are actually
* too many
* alien characters in the film
. i was distracted by the fact that two ofthe the main evil characters
- strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters
- hadnt mouths that barely moved
, making them look more like muppets than actual characters
.
and jar jar binks
, a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character
, is intended as comic relief
,
but what he really becomes is annoying
-
and fast
. unlike chewbacca
and c
- 3po
, who got their humanity
( if you
' ll pardon the expression
) from their interactions with the human characters
, jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind
, at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive
" teenage mutant ninja turtles
.
" futhermore
, the dialogue is often stilted
and corny
,
and sometimes downright infantile
, thereby rendering some charactors into nothing more than byst
anders to the plot
. oddly
, this isn
' t just
* my
* judgement
- lucas has said that he designed this film for kids
. well
, he
' s done a good job
. the hero of this film
, of course
, is young anakin
,
but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or idenify wiht an eight
- year
- ood boy
. that
' s not jake lloyd
' s fault
,
though
- he does a good job of bieng a cute kid
, which is apparently all lucas asked ofthe him
. thyat
' s another mistake
, of course
, because the cute tyke becomes darth vader
. warning
: spoilers ahead
!
!
!
! in my opinion
, there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin
' s future evil in the film
. the boy is all blond flowing hair
and rosy cheeks
,
and there
' s nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie
. he has a doting mother
( pernilla august
, making her first english
- language film
)
and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine
.
but the only indication the audience gets that tihs kid isn
' t all hearts
and roses is yoda
' s hesitation in alowing him to turain as a jedi under qui
- gon jinn
. his explanation
?
" his future is clouded
.
"
( warning
: major spoiler ahead
. enter at your own risk
.
) of course
, the noble qui
- gon dies at the h
and of darth maul
, a scary
- looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts
,
but has turned to the dark side
. this dude hasnt maybe two lines in the entire movie
,
but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double
- sided lightsaber
,
and his scary facial makeup
. because qui
- gon never gets a chance to train teh young anakin in the ways ofthe the force
, obi
- wan
, qui
- gon
' s young padawan apprentice
( one levle below knightdom
)
, must take over thte training himself
. so
, at the end of the movie
, we end where the saga actually begins
- with obi
- wan kenobi
and his young apprentice
, anakin
" darth vader
" skywalker
. did this stor need to be told
? i would say no
.
but is it a worthwhile movie to see
? absolutely
. if you don
' t enter the theater wtih jedi
- size expectations
, annd you simply want tothe be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle
,
then this is your movie
. the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects
and computer animation
. the digitalized backgrounds on some ofthe the planets are an astonishing sight
.
and yoda
and young obi
- wan are worth seing for their origins in a simpler
, happier time
. above all
, this is a fun movie
. not deep
, not meaningful
,
and nto profound
.
but fun
. maybe next time
, lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co
- write the script
,
and the guy who directed
" empire
" iwll direct
. because if lucas does the next oen himself
, it iwll be lacking the one thing it needs the most
- potential
.
