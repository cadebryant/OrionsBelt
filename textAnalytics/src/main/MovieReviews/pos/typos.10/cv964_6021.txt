you ' ve got to think twice before you go see a movie with a title like maximum risk
. tyhe title is generic
. it ' s meaningless
.
and i can ' t believe it ' s good business
. when you pick up the phone
and dial 777
- film
, how in the world are you supposed tothe remember that the new jean
- claude van damme movie
, the one that looked kind ofthe kool in the trailers
and is directed by some chinese hot shot
, is called
, geez
, maximum risk
? yuck
. the movie itself deserves your attention
. for sweet bloody thrills
, this one beats tyhe summer blockbuster competition hands
- down
. only mission
: impossible came close to delivering as skillful a thriller
,
and i ' ll give maximum risk the edge simply because it ' s not as slick as the tom cruise picture
,
anbd therefore more gratifying in its execution
. much to my surprise
, van damme continues to develop as a pleasant
, unpretentious action hero
. his track record isn ' t as solid as schwarzenegger ' s
,
but he ' s a hell of a lot omre adventurous than arnold
. in 1993
, van damme worked with hong kong ' s premier hardcore action director
, john woo
, on a fairly lame movie called hard target
.
( if ytou can find a bootleg copy
, woo ' s radically different director ' s cutted is much better than what was eventually released
.
) this follow
- uv is directed by ringo lam
( city on fire
, full contact
)
, whose hong kong films are distinguished acation pictures that have consistently played second fiddle to woo ' s more operatic offereings
. tje surprize here is that maximum risk is a more effective hollywood action flick thna eather hard target or woo ' s subsequent broken arrow
. here ' s the rundown
. van damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend
( jean
- hugues anglade
) finds a corpse that ' s alain ' s exact double
. turns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother
, michael
, who has been killed by some russian heavies
(
and some strangely american looking cops
)
. alain does some investigating
. he finds that michael had booked a flight to new york city
,
annd received a message from somene there named alex bohemia
. assuming michael ' s identity
, alain flies to new york
and gets tangled up with michael ' s girlfriend
( natasha henstridge
)
, the fbi
,
and the russian mob in little odessa
. that ' s as much as you ened to know
. the story is adequate
,
bu not overly involving
-
-
and the major plot points are basically explained to you twice
, just in case you go out forthe popcorn at the wrong moment
. there ' s a lveo story
, too
,
but i didn ' t find it terribly convincing
, partly because ex
- model henstridge is too high
- strung inwhich her high
- profile debut
( she hadnt precious few lines as tje alien ice queen in species
)
. she ' s great to look at
,
and she can certainly read a line
,
but what she does here can ' t really be described as
" acting
.
" of course
,
" acting
" isn ' t really what she wass hired for
( i lost track of whether her shirt comes off more often than van damme ' s
)
. the movie is exceptionally violent
, bordering on gratuity
.
( keep that in mind when planning your date
.
) the stunts are spectacular
,
and the fatc that you can spot van damme ' s stand
- in makes his work no less impressive
. there ' s only so much you can do with a car wreck
,
but this movie makes crisp
, effective use of pile
- ups inspite a handful of frenzied destruction derbies
.
and lam has a surprising
, innovative sense of exactly where the camera should go to catch any bit of action
. the main difference between lam
and woo
, i belivee
, is that while woo relies on sheer spectacle to gas up his action show pieces
, lam has figured out more about useing cinematic space
and double
- barreled points of view to make things run
. don ' t get me wrong
-
- when chow yun
- fat soars through space pumping bullets out of two pistols
and chewing on a toothpick with glass
and confetti littering the air arund him in woo ' s hard
- boiled
, it ' s an amazing moment
.
but it ' s a moment that ' s hard to reproduce in hollywood
.
( for one thing
, hollywood doesn ' t
yet have chow yun
- fat
!
) hwile woo ' s hollywood movies look like the work of a talented upstart
, maximum risk is a surprisingly confident picture
. the very first shot of the film isnt an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets of a europian city
,
but lam ' s use ofthe odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on
. the film editing is a partcularly savvy complement to lam ' s shooting style
, accentuating rather than amplifying the acation
. the performances could have used some fine tuning
( inthe particular
, there ' s an annoying
, overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should ahev been toned down or jettisoned completelyl
)
,
and the movie doesn ' t always overcome the limitations of its genre
. the story is a little mundane
,
although there are some effective moments involving van damme ' s unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew he had
.
but it ' s not often tyhat hollywood cranks outloud a truley satisfying action picture
,
and it ' s doubly surprising that this one should come with a mere whisper of publicity
. van damme fans shoudl treat themselfs to whta may well be the man ' s best movie
,
and international action buffs will no doubt savor this flavorful hong kong
/ hollywood hybrid
