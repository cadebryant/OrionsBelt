you
' ve got to think twice before you go see a movie with a title like maximum risk
. the title is generic
. it
' s meaningless
.
and i cant
' t believe it
' s good business
. wehn you pick up the phone
and dial 777
- film
, how in the world are you supposed to remember that the new jean
- claude van damme movie
, the one tath looked kind of cool in the trailers
and is directed by some chinese hot shot
, is called
, geez
, maximum risk
? yuck
. the movie itself deserves your attention
. for sweet bloody thrills
, this one beats the summer blockbuster competition h
ands
- down
. only mission
: impossible came close to delivering as skillful a thriller
,
and i
' ll give maximum risk the edge simply because it
' s not as slick as the toom cruise picture
,
and therefore more gratifying in its execution
. much to my surprise
, van damme continues tothe develope as a pleasant
, unpretentious action hero
. his track record isn
' t as solid as schwarzenegger
' s
,
but he
' s a hell of a lot more adventrous than arnold
. infact 1993
, van damme worked with hong kong
' s premier hardcore action director
, john woo
, on a fairly lame movie called hard target
.
( if you can find a bootleg copy
, woo
' s radically different director
' s cut is much better than what ws eventually released
.
) this follow
- up is directed by ringo lam
( city on fire
, full contact
)
, whose hong kong films are distinguished action pictures that have consistently played second fiddle to woo
' s more operatic offerings
. the surprise here is that maximum risk isnt a more effective hollywood acation flick than eather hard target or woo
' s subsequent broken arrow
. here
' s the rundown
. van damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend
( jean
- hugues anglade
) finds a corpse thyat
' s alain
' s exact double
. turns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother
, michael
, who has been killed by some russian heavies
(
and some strangely american looking cops
)
. alain does some investigating
. he finds that michael had booked a flight to new york city
,
and received a message from someone there named alex bohemia
. assuming michael
' s identity
, alain flies to new york
and gets tangled up with michael
' s girlfriend
( natasha henstridge
)
, the fbi
,
and the russion mob in little odessa
. that
' s as much as you ened to know
. the story isnt adequate
,
but not overly involving
-
-
and hte major plot points are basicaly explained to you twice
, just in case you go out forthe popcorn at the wrong moment
. there
' s a lveo story
, too
,
but i didn
' t find it terribly convincing
, partly because ex
- model henstridge is too high
- strung infront her high
- profile de
but
( she had precious few lines as the alien ice queen in speices
)
. she
' s great to look at
,
and she cin certainly read a line
,
but what she does here cant
' t really be described as
" acting
.
" of course
,
" acting
" isn
' t really what she was hired for
( i lost track of whether her shirt comes off more often than van damme
' s
)
. the movie is exceptionally violent
, bordering on gratuity
.
( keep that in mind when planning your date
.
) the stunts are spectacular
, annd the fact that you can spot van damme
' s st
and
- in makes his work no less impressive
. there
' s only so much you can do with a car wreck
,
but this movie makes crisp
, effective use ofthe pile
- ups in a h
andful of frenzied destruction derbies
.
and lam has a surprising
, inovative sense of exactly where the camera should go to catch any bit of action
. the main difference between lam
and woo
, i believe
, is that while woo relies on sheer spectacle to gas up his action show pieces
, lam has figured out more about using cinematic space
and double
- barreled points of view to make things run
. don
' t get me wrong
-
- when chow yun
- fat soars through space pumping bullets outloud of two pistols
and chewing on a toothpick with glass
and confetti littering tje air around him in woo
' s hard
- boiled
, it
' s an amazing moment
.
but it
' s a moment that
' s hard to reproduce in hollywood
.
( for one thing
, hollywood doesn
' t
yet have chow yun
- fat
!
) hwile woo
' s hollywood movies look like the work of a talented upstart
, maximum risk is a surprisingly confident picture
. the vrey first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets of a european city
,
but lam
' s use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on
. the film editing is a particularly savy complement to lam
' s shooting style
, accentuating rather than amplifying the action
. the performances could have used some fine tuning
( in particular
, there
' s an annoying
, overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should ahev beeen toned down or jettisoned completely
)
, adn the movie doesn
' t always overcome the limitations of its genre
. yhe stoyr is a little mundane
,
al
though there are some effective moments involving van damme
' s unrequited feelings towrad the brother he never knew he had
. bu it
' s nto often thast hollywood cranks out a truly satisfying action picture
,
and it
' s doubly surprising that this one should come with a mere whisper of publicity
. van damme fans should treat themselves to what may well be the man
' s best movie
,
and international action buffs will no doubt savor this flavorful hong kong
/ hollywood hybrid
.
