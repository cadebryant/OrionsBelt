note
: some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers
. be forewarned
. east meets west inspite mulan
, the latest installment in disney
' s parade of annual animated feature films
. an odd fusion of ancient asian traditions
and disconcerting elements which betray obvious mass
- market commercial sensibilities
, tihs confident entry is easily the most engaging
and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years
,
but falls short of actualizing its potential
.
though not for lack of trying
. in many respects
, mulan is among disney
' s most mature efforts
, skirting tje surface of adult themes
and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat
. the violence of the battles inwhich the film are admittedly sanitized
-
- the imagery of a pillaged village
, neatly encapsulated in the form of a child
' s discarded doll
, isnt in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his falled guardians in star wars
,
and mulan
' s later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so inspite the most tidy
, bloodless method imaginable
-
-
yet how oftenly doens a hollywood animated film
, long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent
, dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provacative manner
? inthe an instant
, idealistic mulan
' s innocence is lost
,
and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their effords are spent defending
. tje film
, based upon an ancient chinese fable
, centers on a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her family
' s obligatory conscript wehn china finds itself under attack by huns
( cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones
, replete with glowing yellow eyes
and dagger
- edged teeth
,
al
though lent a surprisingly genuine sense of menace
)
. dipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings ofthe familiar western
/ european fables
and literature for decades
, disney
' s new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere
, story intact
, to some neutral territory
,
and revels in its east asian roots
; aside from a predominantly asian
- american cast providing the film
' s vocal work
, there
' s liberal useage of oriental iconography throughout
,
and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence
. hwile tyhe film does occasionally reach its limits
and starts tothe tread upon ood stereotypes
-
- invoking pseudo
- asian references to items like beancurd
and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary
,
and i can
' t imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors
* really
* included karate
- chopping blocks of stone inspite two
-
- it
' s rather remarkable that a movie primarily positioned for american
and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign terriory
. the film alsot freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset
;
al
though savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately
, it
' s startlingly assertive in providing as little shorth
and as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to tjhe customs
and traditions of mulan
' s l
and
. at its core
, the film is a tale of heroic adventure
,
and as such paints its story infront bold strokes of honour
, perseverance
, nobility
and courage
. as such
, animation is the perfect vehicle forthe tihs flavour ofthe epic
, where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work h
and
- in
- h
and with visual purity
. scenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action
, such as mulan
' s venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice
, are lent a sense of strength
and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation
. mulan capitalizes on htis during its strongest moments
, particularly druing our heroine
' s character
- defining oppening half
- hour
. it
' s when the film attempts to intergrate the traditional mainstays of recent hollywood animation
-
- the friendly animal sidekick
, the colourful array ofthe supporting characters
-
- inot the mix where it goes slightly awry
. off to battle
, mulan finds herself being trailed by a jive
- talking diminutive dragon called mushu
and an agreeable little
" lucky
" cricket
, who ostensibly appear to assist in her subterfuge
and realistically serve as audience
- friendly comic relief
. they
' re affable presences
,
and not precisely ineffective
-
- reasonable amounts of humour are elicited
,
and eddie murphy
( who voices mushu
) is amusingly earnest
-
-
but amidst all the high melodrama
, the effect is mildly jarring
and
, from a storytelling perspective
, questonable in its necessity
. at training camp
, mulan antagonizes
and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits
( easily characterized simply as the short clown
, the skinny clown
,
and the big clown
)
, who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness
, anbd
, in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns
, she grows a certain fondness for a h
andsome
, square
- jawed young captian
, shang
. everybody needs love
, even ancient chinese warrior princesses
,
but not necesarily inthe
* this
* film
. the romantic angle
, which lets the air out of the sails of the story
' s neo
- feminist underpinnings
, lacks any genuine spark
and plays out like a contractual obligation
. another staple of recent disney animated films
, a cache of hummable little ditties
, has also obligingly been carried over to mulan
but proves to be a decided weakness
. composed by matthew wilder
, none of the h
andfull of tunes are particularly distinguishing
,
and one
-
-
" i
' ll amking a man out of you
"
( unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean fighting machines
)
-
- becomes so grating
and hackneyed that it seems allmost interminable
. only
" reflections
"
, an easly ballad of lament
, proves to be a song of any consequence
, serving as an effective showcase for lea salonga
, one of musical theatre
' s most wondrously pure voices
. nonetheless
, mulan is an especially appealing piece of work from the disney factory
, with a strong narrative arc
and plesant artwork
; the computer
- generated stampede of hun warriors charging down a snow mountain is wholly impressive
. while the blatantly child
- friendly elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of the film
, they
' re not dissuasive
and remain fairly enjoyable
. briskly paced with a smart
, energetic heroine
and filled with high adventure
, the film is ultimately most satisfying onthe the intimate scale of father
and daughter
.
