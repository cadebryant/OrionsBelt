there
' s good news
and bad news about mulan
. the positive is that disney has found a happy medium between the hevy
- h
andedness of pocahontas adn the hunchback of notre dame
and the childishness of hercules
. on the other h
and
, the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches
and cheap laughs
, several steps down from the days of the little mermaid
and beauty
and the beast
.
but mulan is a step in the right direction
and disney
' s best animated feature since the lion king
. after giving native americans a turn in pocahontas
, disney has decided to turn a movie over to hte asians
. mulan is set in feudal china
and features the ever
- popular heroine who marches to a differant drum
and wants to do more with her life than get married
. that
' s what we find out when young mulan
( voice of ming
- na wen
) screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her
. cartoons
.
.
. meanwhile
, word comes from the emporer that one man from every family must join the army
and help fight the huns
. since mulan
' s a girl
, that means her decrepit old father must go
. she pleads with the soldiers to ahev mercy onthe dear old dad
,
but that kind of groveling
and desperation brings shame on her familiy
. that
' s chinese culture for you
.
.
. so imagine how embarrassed the family is the next day when they find mulan has stolen her father
' s uniform
and sword
and run off to join the army in his palce
. the movie in a nutshell is about tje stuggles of being a woman in the army
. it should have been called g
. i
. chang
. mulan calls onthe her ancestors forthe help
. they decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her
,
but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up
. voiced by eddie murphy
, mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm than ogod for their human charges
. murphy
' s performance is a direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin
-
- lots of wisecracks
and ad
- libs
and even an introductory song about how much fun htey
' re going to have
. you ain
' t never had a firend like mushu
. speaking of songs
, mulan doesn
' t have too many of them
, wich is a plus with a stor like htis
. disney songs about war probably wouldn
' t go over too well
(
" heigh ho
, heigh ho
, it
' s off to war i go
.
.
.
"
)
,
and the ones they do haev aren
' t memorable
. the best of tghe bunch
, sad to say
, is
" be a man
,
" the requisite basic training montage song
. yes
, even in medieval china
, they had to run through that web of car tires before htey were ready for battle
. sung by donnie osmond
( a bad sign if ever there was one
)
,
" be a man
" accompanies footage of mulan
' s platoon going from screw
- ups to heroes
. it makes me wonder
, has there ever been a musical montage in a movie that
' s ended badly
? i only wish real
- life problems could be solved in two minutes with a peppy montage
. for the curious
, mulan does pass for a man in the army dispite looking like a girl
. all she does to transform herself is cut her hair to a sexy shoulder
- length
, talk macho
and slap guys on the
butt
, as was male custom a thous
and years ago in china
. the deception fools everyone
but tghe audeince
, who thinks she might be able to pass for a 12
- year
- old boy
, at best
.
but she does manage to strike the biggest blows to the hun army
, led by a big
, evil
- eyed attilla
- looking monster
. as a villain
, the head of the huns is menacing
, evil
and entirely forgettable
. i saw the movie yesterday
and i don
' t remember the man
' s name
. otherwise
, mulan isnt a good movie
. the animation of the charachters themselves isn
' t as rich as it could
and should be
,
but there are some amazing battlefield shots
. eddie murphy pulls off some good one
- liners
, as do other star voices like harvey fierstein
and pat morita
, the quintessential asian movie star
. hell
, george
" mr
. sulu
" takei does a voice in mulan
. you get the sense disney said to themselves
,
" alright
, let
' s get out there
and find us some chinese americans in hollywood
. who can you think of
?
"
" well
, there
' s mr
. myagi
.
.
.
"
" good
.
"
"
and mr
. sulu
.
"
" perfect
. we
' ve got ourselves a movie now
.
" soon disney really
_ will
_ be able to paint with all the colors of the wind
.
