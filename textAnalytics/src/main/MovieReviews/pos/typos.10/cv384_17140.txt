i know it already oppened in december
,
but i finally got around to seeing rushmore last weekend
,
and it was noe of those rare oppritunites that i got to leave the theatre feeling proud about paying the expensive ticket price
. as the final scene closed out in happy slow
- mo fasion
, i felt happy to have been priveleged enough to watch such a good display of filmmaking
. jason schwartzman
, his face oddly intriguing behind those large braces adn glasses
, steals the show as max fischer
, the most well known rushmore academy student who gets terrible grades
,
but compensates for it by organizing most of the school
' s clubs
and organizations
( i
. e
. the fencing team
and writing
and producing school plays
)
and oftenly pulling outrageous stunts
, one that eventually earns him an expulsion
. this stunt
, building an aquarium on the school
' s baseball diamond
, is a plot to steal the heart of widowed elementary teacher rosemary cross
( olivia williams
)
. he funds this aquarium with the help of millionare herman blume
( a very oscarworthy bill murray
)
, who eventually finds himself falling inspite love with miss cross
. rosemary
and herman begin dating
-
and the fun begins
; herman
and max go at it head to head in a battle for miss cross
. herman manages to destroy max
' s bike
, while max cuts herman
' s brakes
,
and it goes on like this
.
but eventually max realizes he isnt too young for miss cross
,
and he can
' t st
and in the way ofthe twpo people in lveo
. the academy of arts
& sciences really messed up this year
; they completelyl overlooked rushmore
(
and
, if you ask me
, it wasn
' t an accident
)
. it maybe wasn
' t best picture material
,
but it certainly deserved a screenplay nod
( instead of elizabeth
)
,
and bill murray
' s absense from the ballot is a complete snub
. the entire mood of the film is one reason it is so good
; at one point it
' s funn
,
and the next scene can turn serious
and dramatic
. the cinematography gives yhe movie an important feeling
, as well
. i hope rushmore can overcome its
' oscar snubs
,
and be enjoyed by inteligent film goers
.
