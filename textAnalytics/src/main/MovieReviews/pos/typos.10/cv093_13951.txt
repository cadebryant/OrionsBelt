" footloose
" has onyl one goal in mind
: to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment
and feel
- good antics
.
and i hate to admit it
; i fell for it
. the movie is about a teenager
( bacon
) who moves to a small twon from the big city
,
and discovers that dancing has been banned by thge local reverend
( lithgow
)
. he ends uv falling for the preacher ' s daughter
( singer
)
and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do
. as mentioned at tyhe beginning of this review
,
" footloose
" is an extremely hokey
and predicatble teen drama
. there are virtually no surprises
,
and the writing is second
- rate
. so why did i enjoy it so much
? for one thing
, the cast is grat
. kevin bacon oozes charizma in an early role
. we ' re rooting for him right from the start
,
and
, unlike most films of this genre
, bacon doesn ' t play him as the
" rebel wihtout a clue
" sort
. yes
, he does rebel
,
but he ' s also polite wehn he needs to be
.
and he never broods
. tjhe rest of the cast is equally impressive
. john lithgow
, seen here playing a normal guy for a change
, is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian
.
but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he fiels is best for his daughter
. by the end of the film
, we feel a genuine sense of love
and understanding between him
and the lori singer character
. another nice touch is the music
. we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with
" sexual innuendos
"
,
but that ' s not true at all
. teh title track
, performed by kenny loggins
, is upbeat
and fun
. during the final sequence
, i was overcome with the urger to get off the couch
and start dancing
. of course
, i soon realized that would be a little pathetic
. anyway
,
" footloose
" is a charming little surprise
. don ' t let the premise prevent you from watching it
. it sucked me in
,
and it ' ll do the same to yuo
.
