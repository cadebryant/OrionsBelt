no
, it is not a bad film
, infront fact it is so good in achieving its purpose
, i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly
. event horizon is not your run
- of
- the
- mill sci
- fi film
, i
' m sure many who have watched this will agree with me
. it is not even originnal in tath sense
,
and it does borrow heavily from films like alien
, hellraiser
and even blade runner
. the magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting
and methodical build
- up that makes it wonderfully horrifying
. the story brings us to the yearm 2050
, where space travel have usance enormously progressed
. the event horizon is actually a ship built for a secret experimental purpose
; it has teh abillity to fold time annd space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a man
' s lifetime
. the ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation
but after 7 years
, it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune
. a search
and rescue team led by miller
( fishburne
) is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon
. the designer of the ship
, dr
. weir
( neill
) follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship
. event horizon is a sci
- fi horror film
, much truer tothe the word than say
, alien would ever be
. while in alien
, the crew has to cope with a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces
, in event horizon
, the forces which goes against the crew is undefined
but
yet so powerful
and horrifying
. the story unfolds itself slowly
and the suspense buildup is superb
, up till tghe point where i really felt liuke saying out loud
` enought
! i can
' t st
and this anymore
!
'
. there are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime
. the story in itself isnt not exactly something very exciting
and also
, the acting is only at most
, averege by most commercial st
andars
. even so
, the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film
, thanks to its well
- paced storytelling
, disturbing set designs
and some raelly gory sequences
( which incidentally
, has been qutie generously removed by our censorship board
)
. director paul
anderson
( who did mortal kombat
)
and his team of
` atmosphere
' creators have done well inwhich keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term
` horror
'
. this picture did not do very well in the us box
- office most probably for the dread
- factor inpact it has on most audiences
; people wiull not see it again
and nto many would recommend their friend to watch this
.
al
though on the face of it
, event horizon is mostly molded for mass
- entertainment
; many thrills
, spills
and suspense to keep audiences in focus
.
however
, the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing
. my friend anbd i could not say a word to each other fo qtuie a hwile after going thru the
` experience
' of event horizon
. i guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film hadnt cast upon us
. be forewarned
, this film is not for the faint
- hearted nor for pure entertainment
. be prepared to be distrubed if you should decide to watch this film
! event horizon is highly recommended
?
?
but at your pwn risk
! it has been a long time since good
- horror embraced the big screen
,
and event horizon is one
.
