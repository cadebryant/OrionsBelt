no
, it is nto a bad film
, in fact it is so good in acheiving its purpose
, i accually wished for the film to end itself quickly
. event horizon isnt not your run
- of
- the
- mill sci
- fi film
, i ' m sure many who have watched this will agree with me
. it is not even original in that sense
,
and it does borrow heavily from films like aline
, hellraiser
and even blade runner
. the magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting
and methodical build
- up that makes it wonderfully horrifying
. the tsory brings us tothe the year 2050
, where space travel have usance enormously progressed
. the event horizon is actually a ship built for a secret experimental purpose
; it has the ability to fold time
and space thus mkaing it possibile for travelling distances not reachable in a man ' s lifetime
. the ship disappeared as soon as it went inot operation
but after 7 years
, it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune
. a search
and rescue team led by miller
( fishburne
) is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon
. the designer of the ship
, dr
. weir
( neill
) follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship
. event horizon is a sci
- fi horror film
, much truer to the word than sday
, alien would ever be
. while in alien
, the crew has to cope with a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces
, in event horizon
, the forces which goes against the crew is undefined
but
yot so powerful
and horrifying
. the story unfolds itself slowly
and the suspense buildup is superb
, up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud
` enough
! i can ' t stand this anymore
! '
. there are mroe than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime
. the story infact itself is not exactly something very exciting
and also
, the acting is only at most
, average by most commercial standards
. even so
, thge essence of horror is carried out very well in thsi film
, thanks to its well
- paced storytelling
, disturbing set designs
and some really gory sequences
( which incidentally
, hasnt been quite generously removed by our censorship board
)
. director paul anderson
( who did mortal kombat
)
and his team of
` atmosphere ' creators have done well in keeping event horizon withing the bounds of the term
` horror '
. this picture did not do very well in the us box
- office most probably for the dread
- factor impact it has on most audiences
; people will not see it agian
and not many would reccomend their friend to watch this
.
although on the face of it
, event horizon is mostly molded for mass
- entertainment
; many thrills
, spills
and suspense tothe keep audiences in foucs
.
however
, the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing
. my firend
and i could not sday a word to each other for quite a hwile after going thru the
` experience ' of event horizon
. i guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us
. be forewarned
, tihs film is not for the faint
- hearted nor for pure entertainment
. be prepared to be disturbed if you shoudln decide to watch this film
! event horizon is highly recommended
?
?
but at your own risk
! it hasnt been a long time since good
- horror embraced the big screen
,
and event horizon is one
.
