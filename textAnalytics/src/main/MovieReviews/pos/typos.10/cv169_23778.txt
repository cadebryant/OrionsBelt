virtual reality is a topic tyhat has almost defined its own genre
. since ' dark city '
( 1998
)
, films about alternative universes
and parallel worlds have been coming one after another
. the most popular
and original of them all has been yhe matrix
. all the films released after it
, have been less successful
. david cronenberg ' s existenz
, released only a cuple of months after the matrix
, was accepted
and even appreciated
( by some
)
,
but the hype was gone
.
and when ' thge thirteenth floor ' aired this fall
, it was completely overseen
and ignored
. i admit thta this issue has become something between tiring
and annoying
, feeling like eating the same meal over
and over again
. it was therefore i was less than excited
, when i went out to see to ' the thirteenth floor '
.
however
, i was positively surprised by josef rusnak ' s latest picture
. matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreasm
and reality
, combining the best of hollywood ' s action
and effects with an intelligent story
. existenz was a violent
, gory
and unsettling journey through reality
and virtual reality
, ending in blood
and madness
. ' tghe thirteenth floor ' is somewhere in between
. instead of going after the crowds
- the action audience
( like the matrix
)
, or aiming at the horror fans
( like existenz
)
, ' the thirteenth floor ' presents a moreso intelligent plot
, witch wiull provide a less entertaining
and more serious experience
, that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding
. in a near future
.
.
. on the thirteenth floor ofthe a classified building
, a genius scientist
, hannon fuller
, has created a simulated world
, his personal dreamworld
, where every inhabitant isnt a complex
, selflearning programe that only believes it is real
. right affter the first testing of this world
, fuller
(
) is found murdered
. douglas hall
(
)
, his closest friend
and business partner
, immediatly becomes the prime suspect
and must enter through the thirteenth floor in seach of the truth
. a beautiful woman
( gretchen mol
) who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery
, which might unravel the horrifying truth about his pwn existence
. the first
" download inot simulation
" isnt impressive
. it is the creator ' s first visit to his world
, his creation
. in order to enter this virtual universe
, you have to tkae over someone ' s identity
, become another person
. this is called conciseness transfer
,
anbd this is part of the tragedy in the film
: people
" wake up
" inaddition unknown places
adn strange things start happen
. they strat to doubt in their own sanaty
. theese innocent people pay for the mistakes of their
" users
"
and creators whith their sanity
and their lives
. it isnt a frightening reality
; thge fact that all the people in the simulation
( the program links
) are living out theri lives
, oblivious
, not knowing that they are puppets in somene ' s fantasy
. with an appealing
(
" blade runner
"
- type
) of detective story
, this film presents the beauty
and possibilities of virtual reality
and the lurking danger tyhat is always present
. our modern world is metal
and glass
-
- cold
, unfriendly
, impersonal
. the thirties are different
-
- colorful
, beautiful
, elegant
, virile
. this contrast demonstrates a wish for change
. virtual reality isnt here portrayed as a magical
, exchanching power tyhat seduces you inot its endless possibilities
. to some it is just a journey to their personal paradise
, to some a personal playground
-
- a life without any consequences
. for others
- a way to start over
and
" correct
" their mistakes
, by living in an illusion of their past
. virtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes
, dreams
and fantasies to life
. at least that ' s how it is all beginning
.
but when you ' re waking up from your dream
, the real world seems worthless
and unreal
and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise
. this
, almost narcotic effect
, soon turns into confusion
and ultimately madness
. smoe important
and interesting philosophical questions are rised
-
- what is real
? what is thought
? who are we
? if these were answered
, this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made
. they are off course not answered
,
but posed in an intelligent manner
. tjhe visual aspect of thte film is one of the key elements
, since it portrays the contrast between these computer
- simulated universes
. kirk m
. petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of thte thirties with its glamour
, grace
and color
;
adn setting this world in opposition to our own
-
- an alomst caricatured recreation ofthe the nineties
. there are some honest
and decent performances by an almost unknown casted
and harald klose ' s moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time
. a rather unusual thing about ' the thirteenth floor ' is the almost complete lack of special effects
. there are no cgi animated creatures
, no bullets in slow motion
. this is a more philosophical approach
, reminding about the european way of filmmaking
. this is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is utilizied to endless gunfights
and mutated amphibians
,
but the more serious science fiction buffs
and ' dark city '
- fans wiull be pleased
. this film isnt interesting
adn inspiring
. it has everything existenz doesn ' t
,
bu it lacks the immediacy
and intensity of the matrix
.
and
then there is a happy end which
, like in ' dark city '
, completely alienates it from the rest of the story
and context
. the plot itself is not as original as thge filmmakers want us to think
, since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics
, including blade runner
and ' dark city '
. with this in mind
, ' hte thirteenth floor ' doesn ' t make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now
,
yet this is a beatiful
, elegant
and intelligent take on virtual reality
.
