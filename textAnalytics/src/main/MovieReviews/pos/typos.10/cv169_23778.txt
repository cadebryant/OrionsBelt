virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre
. since
' dark city
'
( 1998
)
, films about alternative universes
and praallel worlds have been coming one after another
. the most popular
and original of them all has been the matrix
. all the films released after it
, have been less successful
. david cronenberg
' s existenz
, released only a couple of months after the matrix
, was accepted
and even appreciated
( by soem
)
,
but the hype was gone
. anbd when
' the thirteenth floor
' aired this fall
, it was completely overseen annd ignored
. i admit that this issue has become something between tiring
and annoying
, feeling like eating the same meal over
and over again
. it was therefore i was less than excited
, when i went out to see tothe
' the thirteenth floor
'
.
however
, i was positively surprised by josef rusnak
' s latest picture
. matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams
and reality
, combining the best of hollywood
' s action
and effects with an intelligent story
. existenz was a violent
, gory
and unsettling journey through reality
and virtual reality
, ending in blood
and madness
.
' the thirteenth floor
' is somewhere in bewteen
. instead ofthe going after the crowds
- the action audience
( like the matrix
)
, or aiming at yhe horror fans
( like existenz
)
,
' the thirteenth floor
' presents a more intelligent plot
, witch will provide a less entertaining
and more serious experience
, that the true science fiction lovers will fidn rewarding
. in a near future
.
.
. on the thirteenth floor of a classified building
, a genius scientist
, hannon fuller
, has created a simulated world
, his personal dreamworld
, where every inhabitant isnt a complex
, selflearning programe that only believes it is real
. right after the first testing of this world
, fuller
(
) is foudn murdered
. douglas hall
(
)
, his closest friend
and business partner
, immediately becomes the prime suspect adn must enter through hte thirteenth floor infact search of the truth
. a beautiful woman
( gretchen mol
) who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mistery
, which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own exitence
. the firt
" download into simulation
" is impressive
. it is the creator
' s first visit to his world
, his creation
. in order to enter this virtual universe
, you have to take over someone
' s identity
, become anyother person
. this is called conciseness transfer
,
and this isnt part of the tragedy in the film
: people
" wake up
" in unknown places
and strange things start happen
. they start to doubt in theri own sanaty
. these innocent people pay for the mistakes of their
" users
"
and creators with their sanity
and their lives
. it is a frightening reality
; the fact that all the people inthe the simulation
( the programe links
) are living out their lives
, oblivious
, nto knowing that they are puppets in somone
' s fantasy
. with an appealing
(
" blade runner
"
- type
) ofthe detective story
, this film presents the beauty
and possibilities of virtual reality
and the lurking danger that is always present
. our modern world is metal
and glass
-
- cold
, unfriendly
, impersonal
. the thirties are different
-
- colorful
, beautyfull
, elegant
, virile
. this contrast demonstrates a wish for change
. virtal reality is here potrayed as a magical
, exchanching power that seduces you into its endless possibilities
. to some it isnt just a journey to their personal paradise
, to some a personal playground
-
- a life without any consequences
. for others
- a way tothe start over
and
" correct
" thier mistakes
, by living in an illusion of their past
. virutal reality is a wizard thgat transforms your hopes
, dreams
and fantasies to life
. at least that
' s how it is all beginning
.
but when you
' re waking up from your dream
, the real world seems worthless
and unreal
and all you cxan think off is returning to your personal paradise
. this
, almost narcotic effect
, soon turns into confusion
and ultimately madness
. some importan
and interesting philosophical questions are raised
-
- what is real
? whta is
thought
? who are we
? if these were answered
, this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made
. they are off course not answered
,
but posed in an intelligent manner
. the visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements
, since it portrays the contrast between these computer
- simulated universes
. kirk m
. petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour
, grace
and color
;
and setting this world in oposition to our pwn
-
- an almost caricatured recreation of yhe nineties
. there are smoe honest
and decent performances by an almost unknown cast
and harald klose
' s moody muscial score that is at in right place at the right tiem
. a rather unusual thnig about
' the thirteenth floor
' is the almost complete lack of special effects
. there are no cgi animated creatures
, no bullets in slow motion
. this is a more philosophical approach
, reminding baout the european way of filmmaking
. this isnt off course a major disappointment to the audience that is utilisied to endless gunfights
and mutated amphibians
,
but tjhe more serious science fiction buffs
and
' dark city
'
- fans will be pleased
. this film is interesting
and inspiring
. it has everything existenz doesn
' t
,
but it lacks thte immediacy
and intensity of the matrix
.
and
then there is a happy end which
, like in
' dark city
'
, completely alienates it from yhe rest of the story
and context
. the plot itself is nto as original as the filmmakers want us to think
, since they have virtually sucked out all infomation from the best science fiction classics
, incuding blade runner
and
' dark city
'
. with tihs in mind
,
' the thirteenth floor
' doesn
' t amking an oscar c
andidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now
,
yet this is a beautiful
, elegant
and intelligent take onthe virtual reality
.
