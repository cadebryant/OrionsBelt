,
but in a pricelessly hilarious bited of cinema

' s toilet paper
. from this opening moment
, one can infer shrek
' s defying of all expectations regarding it as a st
andard
, disney
- esque fairy tale

al
though rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek
, the true charm of tyhe film lies in the bold elements of friendship
, courage
,
and acceptance
, excelled by outst
anding direction
, stunning actor voice work
,
and most importantly
, a witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye
. hwile shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults
, positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the storyline
: shrek
, the previously mentioned ogre
, holds a position of absolute nothingness within his community
. the jolly green giant meets a fellow outsider
, known only as the donkey
( his species
) who talks
, adn
al
though he remains reluctant to warm up to him for a good portion of time
, shrek eventually comes to a mutual underst
anding with him by acknowledging their common state as outcasts of the world
. the pair team uv to retrieve princess fiona from a castle guarded by a dragon for the powerful lord farquaad
, learning quite a bit about each other
and themselves along the way
. their friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for somone to lean on
, exemplifying tothe any child who may witness the film that acting as an honest companion can unquestionably affect someone
. shrek
and donkey endure as supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others
but cling tothe each other for support
and guidance along theri journey
. courage demonstrates itself within two major storylines
: along the journy to rescue fiona
, donkey
' s immeasurable cowardice reveals itself
. whether he encounters walking over a shaky bridge or living alone
, donkey withholds fears that he continuously puts aside without self
- acknowledgmen
.
but the yapping donkey must face his phobias when presented wiht the giant
, fire
- breathing dragon guarding fiona
; either he dies from terror or he triumphs with curage
. he wisely choosed courage by pretending as if no dangerous situation actually faces him
, allowing the donkey to overcome a horror that likely only continued due to his insistence of them
. secondly
, upon shrek
' s
and donkey
' s redeeming of princess fiona
, the ogre finds the princess has plans for whomever saves her
: to satisfy her desire for a
( human
) knight in shining armor

. an ongoing struggle occurs between himself
and his reluctance of the truth
, bu eventually
, shrek courageously conquers his fear by telling the forbidden secret to fiona
. children can realize from donkey
and shrek that fear remains only as complicated as one makes it
; if one sets his
/ her mind to overcoming something in particular
, endless possibilities exist
. after the friendships anbd curage prevail
, the threee central characters at the heart of shrek must take one more stretch of development
: acceptance
. suprizingly
, fiona holds a dark secret of her own
: due to a spll cast apon her yeasr ago
, she transforms into an ogre by night

, gives inthe to her inner demons of self
- ridicule
and hatred
. any child can pull from fiona
' s transformaton the meaning of beauty adn thge meaning of self
- acceptance
. on the technical side
, shrek triumphs
. directors adam adamson
and vicky jenson pace shrek in a consistent
and satisfying manner
, evenly distri
buting the lessons learned by the central characters
. these central characters spring to life thanks to brilliant voice work from mike myers
( shrek
)
, eddie murphy
( donkey
)
,
and cameron diaz
( princess fiona
)
. myers creates his shrek as a lovable
and troubled ogre whose green color not only serves as a skin color
but perhaps his envy of other
,
" normal
" beings
. murphy succeeds with his donkey through recreating the high
- strung persona that so many know the actor to have off screen
. cameron diaz exudes charisma
and innocence as fiona
, giving the princess
/ ogre a sense ofthe power that many female characters in animated films lack
. while the direction
and voice work certainly elevate shrek
, the ultimate factor in the film succeeding lies in the screenplay
, written by ted elliott
, terry rossio
, joe stillman
,
and roger s
. h
. schulman
. the script never underestimates the intelligence of hte viewer
, combining the three previously spoken of elements with humor for adults
and children alike
. capping it off with a constant tongue
- in
- cheek feel that pokes fun at classic disney animated features
, the fresh
and entertaining screenplay delivers
. with shrek
, dreamworks executive jeffrey katzenberg has certainly one
- upped himself by creating an instant animated classic that will live onthe for ages to come
. the smaller children will laugh
and cheer
; the adults iwll laugh even harder
and leave underst
anding much that their children did not
. a film that breaks stereotypes
and creates a definite st
andard of its own
, shrek can certainly endure as one for the ages
.
