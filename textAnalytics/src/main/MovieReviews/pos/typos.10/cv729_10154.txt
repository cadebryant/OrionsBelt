titantic
, writer
and director james cameron
' s much anticipated
and somtimes ridiculed
$ 200
, 000
, 000 epic
, arrives shortly into tje theaters so the question naturally arises
, whether the film is worth it
? as a business propostion
, it seems hard to see how it can ever break even
,
but as a movei it is nothing short of wonderful
. if you
' ve already neatly categorized it as
yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure
, think again
. the movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop
and a portrayal ofthe one of the world
' s most memorable disasters made real
and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers
. infront either case
, it is filmmaking at its best
. whn we entered the press screening
, my wife asked the publicity rep if there woudl be an intermission since the film runs three anbd a quarter hours long
. he said no
but that tje time would go by so fast she
' d never notice the length
. amazingly
, he was right
. titanic is one of the few long films that doesn
' t suffer because of it
. the lush picture
, filmed by russell carpenter in 70mm
, opens in the present wiht two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on tje bottom of the ocean
. fortune hunter brock lovett
( bill paxton
) leads the expedition looking for the world
' s most valuable diamond necklace that whent down wiht hte ship
, known back
then as
" the ship ofthe dreams
.
" the necklace
' s hundred
- year
- old former owner
, rose dewitt bukater
( gloria stuart
)
, finds brock to tell him her story
.
al
though almost all of the movie happens in flashback
, one ofthe the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship ws sunk
. using a computer simulation
, the movie tkaes the tiem to explain what will happen later
, whihc adds immensely to mkaing a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing
. after twenty mintues
, the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage
. in a classic movie theme
, the two parts of the ship
, first class
and steerage
( thrid
- class
) exist in sharp contrast
. the strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich
and poor without excessive moralizing
. entering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance
, cal hockley
, played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane
.
and thanks to a lastest minute winning poker h
and
, an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third class
. even with her own promenade deck
, rose feels trapped on thte ship
, what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes
. in contrast
, jack can barely contain his euphoria at bieng on board
. after jack saves rose ffrom committing suicide
, they start a brief
but impassioned love affair
. never tawdry
and rarely explicit
, their romance has the power to sweep the audience inot the story
. leonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence
and charisma
. infact so many ways
, small
and large
, he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part
. when he confronts cal
, forthe example
, he remains composed
and polite
and
yet subtly undermines every one of cal
' s supercilious put
- downs
. kate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose
. the chemestry between these two academy award nominees
, him for what
' s eating gilbert grape
and her for sense adn sensibility
, is nothing short of astonishing
. from the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ship
' s bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude
, they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances
. if the film breaks after an hour
and a half
, which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up
, you will still get one of the best films ofthe the year
. peter lamont
' s sets are more than au
thentic
. one scene
, fo example
, starts with the planning
- to
- retire captain
, played with insouciance by bernard hill
, having his tea on deck
. it
then shifts to the ship
' s massive gears
and
then to the bright
- hot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals
. the h
andsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner
. easily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits
and before the battle with the water begins in earnest
. at firt
, sicne the iceberg tears a sories of little gashes in the hull
, not some big gaping hole
, the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else
. what a lark
. we
' ve struck an iceberg
. now let
' s get back to our br
andy
and cigars
. the ship
' s musicians play like troopers through it all
, even after tje panic sets in
. after all
, they see it as their duty to calm the passengers
. wehn the musicians are about to die
, they politely thank each other for the pleasure ofthe being able tothe play together
,
and they mean it
. their civility borders on insanity
,
but it is touching nevertheless
. tghe story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface
. there are omre than enough characters to love adn to hate
,
and all of the casting is dead
- on
. special effects wokr best when their presence becomes almsot undetecable
. in titanic
, for which he created a nine
- tenths scale model of the entire ship
, cameron strove for accuracy at all costs
. the most dramatic moment in tje film happens when tghe ship breaks in two
,
and the front section becomes vertical in the water
. people are flung like ants either into the water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immidiately
. besides being romantic
and dramtic
, the script includes liberal doses of humer
. from the many deliciously subtle verbal put
- downs to the physical comedy
, as when jack teaches rose to spit like a man
, the show elicits laughter in addition to perhaps a few tears
.
" it
' s good
- bye for a little while
,
" a less than confident father tells his little girl since it was indeed women
and children first
.
" this boat
' s for mommies
and children
. there
' ll be a boat in a little while for daddies
.
" basicaly there was a design decision to ahev fewer than half of the necessary life boats
-
- it made tghe decks look too crowded otherwise
. perhaps the sinking isnt best summarized by noe of the guggenheim
' s on
- board tghe ship
. in the dining room with the lifeboats gone adn the ship certain to sink
, he is offered a life jacket by one of the crew
.
" noone thanks
