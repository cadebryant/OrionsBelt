] war is a topic taht can
' t help
but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media
. movies
, documentaries
,
and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general spects are focused on
, such as strategy
, politics
,
and victory
. it
' s easy to forget war
, in its most basic form
, is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other
. forgotten more easily is the fact tath each soldier
, no matter what his rank or importance
, is a rela flesh
-
and
- blood person
and not jsut a number
.
" saving private ryan
" isnt one of the few films that dares play up this aspect
, especially in its unapologetic
, realistic delivery
. it proves htere
' s a huge difference between battling annd killing
. the film opens with one of the most graphic
, disturbing scenes in recent memory
. it
' s world war ii
, d
- day to be exact
,
and the u
. s
. military isnt invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them
. spielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sence of reality
. instead of positioned cameras
, the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared
. there is no sense ofthe stability
,
but of constant
, anxious
,
and confusing motion
, giving us tje feeling of being in the middle of the battle
,
and just a vulnerable as the poor troops
.
" poor
" is a proper word to describe how pathetic
and
yet innocent the men fighting are
. there is little tothe no dialogue throughout thte loud battle
and noone prologue to define any characters
. we don
' t git the feeling these are h
andsome actors playing heroic roles
,
but that these are men baout to kill
and be killed fo reasons beyond their underst
anding
. the nazis are not portrayed as enemies tothe be hated
,
but as people that must be destroyed because tehy
' re there
. in the movies
, tyhe good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets
and bombs
and not get a scratch
,
but in reality that wouldn
' t happen
. the men hvea nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks
and dead bodies
. they are sitting ducks
and we realize this through the perspective of the well
- secured germans who cin actually see who
, what
,
and where they
' re shooting
, unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off
. perhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself
and who the men really are
,
but that seems to be part of the theme
. the film seems to rely on the audience
' s sence of patriotism
, that the american military is
" right
"
and good adn that the nazis are
" inherantly evil
.
" the battle scene eventually focusses on a group of men who have miraculously survived
and made their way close tothe the enemy stronghold
( a whole 50
- foot progression
)
,
and begin to inflict some damage
. i have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up
, i couldn
' t help
but fiel some sence of joy
and relief
. tothe triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure
,
but there
' s nothing cliche about the graphic
, detailed
, atmosphere here because it really happend
. oney of the most suprising spects of the film is how littel story consttruction there isnt
,
and
yet the events that take place make sense
and are interesting
. the plot is practically irrelevant since the film isnt moreso concerned with the reality of the war
and teh soldiers we meet
. tom hanks stars as captian miller
, a relatively average man who happens to be yhe leader of a platoon
. he
' s never obsessive or any such generic
, cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character liuke this
. he doesn
' t want tothe be ther any mroe than his men
,
but when he is given a mission he intends to carry it out
. the mission the film is concerned withthe is
, as the title states
, saving private ryan
. through a sories ofthe comm
and started by an ordinary clerical worker
, it is brought to a general
' s attension that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action anbd their mother will receive notices of each
' s death simultaneously
. when they learn a fourth brother is stationed somewhere infact europe
, they make it a top priority to have him retured safely tothe his mother
. it
' s easy to sympathize with this situation
, after all
, no one should have to lose all thier childen at once
. bu finding one man in this war isnt
, as miller puts it
,
" like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles
.
" the saving of private ryan isn
' t just a dramatic device
,
but a thematic one
. his salvation represents the sense of innocence thge ocuntry
, the world even
, was trying to convince itself it still had
. when miller
' s company hears ofthe the mission
, they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead
,
but miller isn
' t so quick to shrug it off
. he knows the only thing that cin raelly save soldiers from death is hope
,
and now he has the opportunity to make someone
' s sence of hope a reality
. the mission to find ryan gives miller
' s group a destination
,
but nto direction
. along teh way many things happen to them
, both good
and bad
. a few battles are fought
, not to be major accomplishments for the war
,
but because they encounter german soldiers
and have noone other choice
. the act of killing itself becomes one of the film
' s major philosophical metaphors
. the soldiers don
' t mind killing other soldiers in blind battle
,
but when they come across a lone survivor who begs them to let him go
, they can barely stop themselves from killing him iin cold blood as some kind of vengeance forthe their losses
. unfortunately
, death is a fact of war
,
and most films try tothe avoid it when it comes to the main characters
,
but here spielberg doesn
' t want us to think these men are invincible
. in fact
, only a small amount of color
and personality is sketched into each man
,
and the performances are good enough to make this method work
.
al
though the cahracters are somewhat typcial
, tjhe actors maintain control over the material at all time
. whether they
' re arguing with each other
, telling stories of back home
, or fighting the germans
, they never go overboard
and always seem believable
. sure
, there
' s a zinger here
and there
,
but war doesn
' t change the fact boys will be boys
. if
and when one dies we too can feel the loss
, even
though we hardly knew them
. the final act brings the story full circle with another tremendous
, violent battle sequence
. private ryan has been found
,
but facing four tothe one odds
, can the americans defeat the germans
and keep ryan alive
? that
' s not a premise for thrills
, it
' s symbolic of everthing the film has worked for
. it would be wrong to say the film has either a happy or sad ending
, it ends the way it must end
. i remember reading a
" calvin
& hobbes
" comic strip where calvin asked his dad something like
,
" dad
, how do armies of men killing each other solve problems
?
"
" saving private ryan
" is the adult version of that question
.
