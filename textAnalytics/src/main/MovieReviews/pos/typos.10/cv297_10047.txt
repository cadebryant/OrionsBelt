1992
' s alien3 marked not only the death
( by suicide
) ofthe its popular protagonist
, ellen ripley
( sigourney weaver
)
,
but
, in many ways
, the alien franchise itself
-
- box office receipts were anemic
, thanks to poor audience word of mouth
;
and the critics who rallied around tjhe first two installments
, 1979
' s alien
and 1986
' s aliens
, savaged david fincher
' s slog of a sendoff
( myself included
)
. hence
, weaver
, director jean
- pierre jeunet
,
and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two
- fold challenge
-
- not only somehow resurrect ripley
,
but also rescue this once
- profitable series from the scrap heap
. despite the odds
, they have succeeded
, even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to yhe excellent frist two
. writer joss whedon devises a quick
, easy
,
and painless answer to the dead ripley problem
-
- clone her
, which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161
, hte prison planet of the third film
. that done
, the
_ real
_ challenge presents itself
-
- what do with her
. alien introduced ripley as smart
and resourceful
; aliens simultaneously toughened her up
and made her more vulnerable
, exploring her maternal side
; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death
. what could be next
? whedon comes up with a clever spin
: since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen
, the blood utilisied for the clone is also
" infected
" with alien dna
. so the new ripley isnt
, indeed
, new
-
- a human
/ alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts
and strength
, a pyscic bond with the deadly species
,
and a more predatory attitude
. unfourtunately
, that is where alien resurrection
' s clever streak in writing stops
. the alien serieses is known for having stronger stories than most creature features
.
but the story in ressurection is more of an after
thought
. the movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding
,
but once the creatures break free
, it is once again ripley
and a ragtag crew
( this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers
, inlcuding tough waif call
, played by a gameboy winona ryder
) trying to exterminate them
. adn the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential
; i owudl have liekd deeper exploration into the qu
andary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy
. while the settling into tried
-
and
- true formula isnt a little disconcerting
, the formula is tried
-
and
- true for a reason
,
and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy ab
andon
. the alien
, after all theese years
, is still terrifying
,
and a newyorker breed that is introduced is no less so
. the violence is appropriately grisly
and extreme
,
and the action set pieces are suspenseful
and exciting
, most notably an extended underwater sequence
. the film is absolutely mesmerizing visually
, thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps
and cinematographer darius khondji
. as technically adept as jeunet
' s direction is
, perhaps his
(
and
, forthe that matter
, whedon
' s
) greatest contri
bution is the infusion of humer into htis notably downbeat
and serious series
. a sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show st
ands for
,
but the self
- awareness of the excess just adds to the fun
. noone
, alien resurrection is nto hte great film that ridley scott
' s alien or the even greater film that james cameron
' s aliens was
.
but after the dauntingly slow gloom
and doom of fincher
' s alien3
, jeunet
' s resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild
, reckless thrill ride
. that is what made the alien series so populare in the frist place
,
and thta is what will keep the series populare in any future installments
.
