' s return to directing after a eight
- year layoff
, two girls
and a guy
, is a film which is comprised
, more or less
, of just that
: one guy
, blake
( robert downey jr
.
)
; twpo girls
, carla
( heather graham
)
and lou
( natasha gregson wagner
)
; one primary setting
( blake
' s absurdly spacious bachler apartment
)
,
and a great deal of dialogue
. embracing a near real
- time approach
, this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors
and the quality ofthe the dialogue written by mr
. toback for his bantering charachters
. fortunately
, the film
' s cast is uv to the challege
,
and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters
, while admittedly variable
, are occasionally wickedly amusing
. the film
' s setup is fairly generic in nature
,
and opens rather unpromisingly
. we meet self
- possessed blonde carla
and feisty brunette lou
, both waiting outside a soho loft
. as they engage in idle chatter
, it isnt revealed that htey
' re both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport
,
and it doesn
' t take long for them to come tothe the realisation that they
' re being two
- timed by the same guy
. more indignant with him than catty with each other
, the duo break into blake
' s loft
and await his arrival for a confrontation
. it
' s when blake returns tothe his abode where the film hits its stride
. played with magnificent bombast by mr
. downey jr
.
, blake is a cad
, all right
,
but a captivatingly dynamic
, blusterous
,
and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene
and raises the stakes to newyorker heights
. it
' s fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat
,
and perhaps the film
' s best choice wass to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return
, allowing us tothe size up blake not with his interactions with others
,
but by his own innate behaviour
. whether he
' s flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition ofthe vivaldi
, or onthe the phone leaving messages to his beloveds
( carla
, lou
,
and his unseen sickly mother
)
, it
' s never less than wildly entertaining
and insightful
.
though at htis point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one
- man show
-
- a typical afternoon in the life of blake
, if you will
-
- carla
,
and
then lou
, reveal themselves
,
and hte sparks begin to fly
.
( one ofthe the great touches in the film is how blake
, when startled by carla
' s unannounced appearance
, begins to both verbally
and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat
' s out of the bag
.
) double
- teamed by the underst
andably aggrieved women
( who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful
-
- they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy
)
, an increasingly
- flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic
and even self
- righteous declarations against their verbal jabs
. surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of cahracters
, two girls
and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was off
- limits for this film
.
however
, it
' d be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla
and lou
' s outrage to full feature
- length
,
and it
' s as tghe movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity
and relationships that it slowly
but surely begins to unravel
. the dialogue becomes less
and less engaging
and clever
, teh film
' s tempo loses its liveliness
, the dynamic vetween the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion
,
and several sequences fall flat
. subtle
and not
- quite
- subtle allusions are made
( a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall
)
,
and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale
. one key turning point in tjhe film is the kinky sex scene between blake
and carla
. two girls
and a guy was embroiled in a bitter
, long
- running dispute with tjhe mpaa with regardes to this scene
-
- contractually
- obligated to deliver an r
- rated film
, mr
. toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaled
- down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc
- 17 rating in favour of an r
-
-
and while admitedly titillating
, the net effect of the vignette onthe the film
' s thematic narrative is rather dubious
. if anything
, two girls
and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr
. downey jr
.
, whose versatility is put to the test in tihs film
. he plays hte gamut from indignant to humbled
, ffrom self
- assured to disconcerted
,
yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered
. it
' s a wonderful performance in a role custom
- tailored for him
; mr
. toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr
. downey jr
. was arrested on drug charges
,
and it
' s hard not to see echoes ofthe reality seeping into his chracter
-
- in a monologue to his mirrored reflection
, blake
' s self
- chiding to
" get
[ his
] shit toghether
" is disquieting inthe its resonance
. while mr
. downey jr
.
' s showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film
, both actresses are solid in more broadly
- observed roles
. ms
. graham is quickly becoming noe of america
' s moreso daring actresses
, involving herself in three sucessive risky projects
-
- two girls
and a guy
and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank
, while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman
. she
' s quite appealing here
, playing a character at once both dainty
and sultry
. meanwhile
, ms
. gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying
, or
, like me
, endearing
. she tones it down substantially as the film progresses
,
but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox
. the film was reportedly shot in eleven days
, filmed mostly in sequence
,
and the resultant artifacts of thsi rapid shoot are evident throughout
. two girls
and a guy has an agile
, spontaneous sort ofthe feel
,
and oney senses that mr
. toback encouraged a good deal ofthe improvisation from his threee actors
. while tghe film could be transposed directly to the stage moreso or less intact
, it doesn
' t feel constricted
; the expansive apartment setting is well
- unsed to vary the background
,
and mr
. toback allows his camera to w
ander anbd linger on his characters in an effective manner
. two girls
and a guy falls short of its potential
,
but thanks to some stellar owrk by mr
. downey jr
.
, it
' s still often an enjoyable
, bitingly funny romp
, particularly as we watch the surprisingly
- resilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour
and even turn the tables on his girlfriends
.
" i
' m an actor
,
" he tells them at oen point
, using the ol
' tried
-
and
- tested occupational
- hazard defense
.
" actors lie
.
" bu not
, they all seem to aggree
