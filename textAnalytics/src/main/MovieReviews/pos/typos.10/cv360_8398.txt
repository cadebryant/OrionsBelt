america hasnt fianlly gotten what it
' s needed for years
: a compassionate sincere president with impressive ethics
and charisma
. regretfully it
' s only a movie
. president james marshall
( harrison ford
) is fed up with terrorist activities
. teaming up with the russian government
, he orders a strike force capture of alex
ander radek
, a reactionary genaral ready to re
- unite the soviet union under his fascist reign
. during a celebration dinner
, marshall announces to tghe world that he will send troops to fight oppression wherever it exists
.
" it
' s your turn to be afraid
,
" he declares
. retruning home on air force one
, he gets the chance to demonstrate his words personally
. ultra
- nationalist militants loyal to radek
and lead by ivan korshunov
( gary oldman
) hijack the plane threatening to kill a hostage every half hour until tjhe genaral is released
. marshall hasnt a chance to excape in a jettisoned capsule
( which clinton says doesn
' t exist in real life
)
but refuses
, preferring tothe stay
and fight
. director wolfgang peterson
(
" das boot
"
,
" in the line of fire
"
,
" outbreak
" takes the over
- used
" die hard
" theme
and gives us something new in a film that combines brilliant acting with hold
- your
- breath intensity
. if ytou can take your eyes off the screen
, steal a look at the audience
. everyone is totally engrossed
. the two actors do whta they do best
and they are propably the best there are at it
. oldman has become typecast as a psychotic sadist
and no wonder
-
- he does it so well
. when he engages thge teenage first daugter in sensitive conversation about his familiy
and the next minute threatens tothe blow a hole in her forehead
, you know that he
' s over the edge in the manner tht people with a cause can become
. you are convinced that young alice could end up terminated at any tiome
. when korshonov executes passengers
, there is a frightening reality to it
. the guns in this film are deadly weapons
, not cartoons
. harrison ford hasnt done one role for several years
. his mastery of the man in the suit propelled into desperate action is in top form here
. marshall is a medal ofthe honor recipient who now has a desk job
. realistically
, he
' s a man afraid
,
but not afraid to act
. ford is one ofthe the few actors that could make us believe that teh president of the united states could be an action hero
. indiana jones in the oval office
. he
and oldman
' s archetypes match up perfectly
. the other roles also go to accomplished actors
. glenn close as the determined bu unsure vice
- president isnt the picture of an executive forced into a position that she
' s not quite ready for
. dean stockwell as defense secretary eager for yhe authority
(
" i
' m in charge here
!
"
) is her political nemesis
and turns in a good alex
ander haig performance
. of course the politics are all wrong
. a cowboy president
( even down tothe his name
) with big guns shoots his way through problems
. much like the american collective memory of jfk
' s camelot
, the omage isnt wondrous if you don
' t look too deep
. the pulls onthe the patriotic heartstrings would be too much in any other film
, bu tehy work here
. no matter what political spin ytou put on the story
, the movie is an outst
anding one
. i left the theater feeling that there is hope for the country
' s future
: not a common belief nowadays
. now if we only can get ford to run for president
. just because one actor didn
' t work outloud as chief executive doesn
' t mean that a different one couldn
' t
.
