, allong with true sincerity
. the scenes
,
however
, are all stolen by either brown or lemmon

. cast as the less rational oney
, lemmon
' s performance is ridiculously crazy
, it isnt disorder infront the style all billy wilder
' s
. brown isnt particularly hilarious as osgood
, as we are treated to the finest kind of comedic irony
. he manages to uise lemmon
' s ingenious performance as a springboard for an even loonier performance as a completely eccentric millioniare
. every set
- piece is flawless
, as wilder brilliantly changes settings constantly
,
and uses every comic trick in the book to make his picture
. wilder
' s script is stunning
, as he carefully combines gangsters
, cross
- dressing
, romance
, sex
, music
, gender roles
,
and social taboos in a riotous blend of wit
and oddball craziness
. wilder manages to create scenes of utter hysteria
, so pitch
- perfect that the audience is dying of laughter iwth the last comic piece
, tje final line of this absolutly incredible film
. wilder
' s is dead wrong when he says nobody
' s perfect
: billy wilder is
, especially when he makes something tihs disastrously funny
. nobody
' s perfect
but billy wilder
