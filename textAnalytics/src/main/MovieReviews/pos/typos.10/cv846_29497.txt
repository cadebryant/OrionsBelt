plot
: a young recruit gets plucked outloud of nowhere by the number one gangster in london
and quickly becomes a staple by his side
.
but this new guy is not like all the others
, he
' s got ambition
, he
' s got goals
and he loves everything he sees about being the number one gangster
. violence
, lots of swearing
and betrayals ensue
. critique
: a very good
, serious
- minded
, unique british gangster flick which misses the
" great
" mark by way of an annoying voice
- over popping up throughout the film
and a so
- so ending
. here
' s
yet another cool crime movie thgat actually manages to bring something new into the mix
. okay
, so it
' s not entirely new
,
but it
' s definitely original when all put together as done here
. the thing i liked most baout htis movie was its au
thentic portrayal ofthe the time preriod in which it was tkaing place
. it
' s 1968
and these dudes are looking ogod
! yes
, it
' s all about the suits
, fellas
.
.
. the italian shoes
, the cufflinks
, the ties anbd the birds
( that
' s ladies
, for thsoe uninitiated
) hanging around you
. here are a bunch of horrible men
, gangsters if you will
, looking sharp
, talking shit annd busting heads all over the place
.
but that
' s not the basis of this movie
. the basis ofthe this film comes in thge relationship between the number one gangster in the group
, the excellent david thewlis
,
and one of his cronies
, paul bettany
, also extremely good in this film
,
and how the power
, sex appeal annd coolness of one
, affects teh other
. you konw how htere are always these
" hanger
- on
" gangster types who latch on to the godfathers
, the leaders
, the top dogs of every crime organization
? well
, most of the time
, these dudes are screened beforeh
and
and are loyal to only one person
.
.
. thyat is
, their boss
. so all the gangster number one needs tothe worry about is his enemies on the other side ofthe the fence
.
but this film brings the betrayals
, the messed up loyalties
, the honor codes among bad guys inot play within the same group
and presents it in quite the stylistic package
. of course
, director paul mcguigan isn
' t trying to be guy ritchie here
,
and doesn
' t over
- stylize his presentation
, jazz it all up with a hip soundtrack or add any humor to the mix
. nope
, he goes straight for the serious stuff
and develops at least two particualr scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i type this
. hte first is a confrontation sequence between bettany
and a man from which he
' s attempting to sway some information
and it is downright nasty
!
(
" look into my eyes
!
"
) in fact
, the last time tath i
' ve seen a guy so scared in a movie was john turturro in that forest scene fomr the coen brothers
' miller
' s crossing
. scary shite
.
but htere
' s an ever better scene than that in this film
. this one features bettany
, once again
, slowly torturing
, hacking
and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster
( from that man
' s point
- of
- view
)
,
but not before turning on a quaint littel tune in tghe background
and removing all ofthe his own expensive clothes
, one by one
( that
' s right
, he
" does
" the guy in his underware
)
. that scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic
and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film
, especially in the relationship between bettany
and his boss
( why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman
?
)
.
but the flick
' s not perfect
. in fact
, i didn
' t mind malcom mcdowell
' s voice
- over narration at first
,
but as the film grew into a major flashback
( most of the film is presented as such
)
, he came in every now
and
then
,
and rarely added anything of interest to the plot
. all he seemed to do was swaer
and call people the c
- word umpteen times
,
and even described oen scene as it was happening
(
"
.
.
. so i opened the door
,
then went up tje lift
, etc
.
.
.
.
"
- it
' s like
, yeah
, i know that alreday
, i could see it on the screen
!
! overdone
.
)
. i also didn
' t quite
" buy
" the ending of the movie
, which despite being original
, seemed a littel unbelievable
, especially when you consider that it
' s supposed to be taking place 30 yeasr later
,
and folks still seem to be holding grudges
, still in love
, still living inspite the same apartments
?
?
!
? i mean
, c
' mon
.
.
. it
' s 30 years
, man
!
! i don
' t know
, somehow it didn
' t work all that well for me
.
but one of my favorite genres has always been the crime movies
,
and this one is a decent addition tothe the lot
. forget the lame title
and malcolm mcdowell
' s narration of the obvious plot points
,
and concentrate on the film
' s stronger attri
butes such as its style
, the exquisite atmosphere of the time period
, its original look at the gangster dynamic within thge same gropu
, its memorable sequences
and the solid performances from its two main leads
, bettany
and thewlis
. incidentally
, unlike a few ofthe the gangster flicks that i mention below
, this one is in no way a parody or homage to this genre of films
.
.
. it
' s the real deal
! note
: this film is packed with strong accents all around
, which makes it hard to make outloud some of the words from time to time
. it
' s also qtuie violent
and i don
' t remember any film that used tje c
- word as much as this one
, so leave the kids at home for this one
