plot
: a young recruit gets plucked out of nowhere by thte number one gangster in london
and quickly becomes a staple by his side
.
but this new guy is not like all tghe others
, he ' s got ambition
, he ' s got goals
and he loves everything he sees about being the number one gangster
. violence
, lots of swearing
anbd betrayals insue
. critique
: a very good
, serious
- minded
, unique british ganster flick which misses the
" great
" mark by way of an annoying voice
- over popping up throughout the film
and a so
- so ending
. here ' s
yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix
. okay
, so it ' s not entirely new
,
bu it ' s definitely original when all put together as done here
. the thing i liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period inaddition whlch it was taking palce
. it ' s 1968
and these dudes are looking ogod
! yes
, it ' s all about the suits
, fellas
.
.
. the italian shoes
, the cufflinks
, thte ties
and the birds
( that ' s ladies
, for those uninitiated
) hanging around you
. here are a bunch of horrible men
, gangsters if you will
, looking sharp
, talking shit
and busting heads all over the place
.
but that ' s not the basis of this movie
. the basis of this film comes in the relationship vetween the number one gangster in the group
, the excellent david thewlis
,
and one of his cronies
, paul bettany
, also extremely ogod inspite this film
,
and how the power
, sex appeal
and coolness of one
, affects the other
. you know how there are always these
" hanger
- on
" gangster types who latch on to the godfathers
, the leaders
, the top dogs of every crime organization
? well
, most of the time
, these dudes are screened beforehand
and are loyal to only one person
.
.
. that is
, their boss
. so all the gangster number one needs to worry about is his enemies onthe the other side of the fence
.
but this film brings the betrayals
, the messed up loyalties
, the honor codes among bad guys into play within the same group
and presents it in quite the stylistic package
. of course
, director paul mcguigan isn ' t trying to be guy ritchie here
,
and doesn ' t over
- stylize his presentation
, jazz it all up with a hip sountrack or add any humor to thte mix
. nope
, he goes straight for the sereous stuff
and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded inaddition my mind as i tipe this
. the first is a confrontation sequence between bettany
and a man from which he ' s attempting to sway some information
and it is downright nasty
!
(
" look into my eyes
!
"
) in fact
, the last time that i ' ve seen a guy so scared in a movie was john turturro in that forrest scene from the coen brothers ' miller ' s crossing
. scary shite
.
but there ' s an ever better scene than thyat in this film
. this one features bettany
, once agian
, slowly torturing
, hacking
and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster
( from that man ' s point
- of
- view
)
,
but nto before turning on a quaint little tune in the background
and removing all of his own expensive clothes
, one by one
( that ' s right
, he
" doesnt
" the guy in his underwear
)
. that scene is alsot in tune with some of the obvious phallic
and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film
, especially in the relationship between bettany
and his boss
( why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman
?
)
.
but thte flick ' s not perfect
. in fact
, i didn ' t mind malcolm mcdowell ' s voice
- over narration at first
,
but as the film grew into a major flashback
( most of the film is presented as such
)
, he came infact every now
and
then
,
and rarely added anything of interest to the plot
. all he seemed to dont was swear
and call peopel the c
- word umpteen times
,
annd even described one scene as it wass happening
(
"
.
.
. so i opened thge door
,
thne went up the lift
, etc
.
.
.
.
"
- it ' s like
, yeah
, i know that already
, i could see it onthe the screen
!
! overdone
.
)
. i also didn ' t qutie
" buy
" the ending of the movie
, which dispite being original
, seemed a little unbelievable
, especially when you consider thgat it ' s supposed to be taking palce 30 years later
,
and folks still seem to be holding grudges
, still in love
, still living in thge same apartments
?
?
!
? i mean
, c ' mon
.
.
. it ' s 30 years
, man
!
! i don ' t know
, somehow it didn ' t work all thyat well for me
.
but one of my favorite genres hasnt always been the crime movies
,
and this one is a decent addition to the lot
. forget the lame title
and malcolm mcdowell ' s narration of the obvious plot points
,
and concentrate on the film ' s stronger attributes such as its style
, yhe exquisite atmosphere of the time period
, its original look at the gangster dynamic within the same group
, its memorable sequences
and the solid performances from its two main leads
, bettany
and thewlis
. incidently
, unlike a few of the ganster flicks that i mention below
, this oen is in no way a parody or homage to this genre of films
.
.
. it ' s the real deal
! note
: tihs film is packed with strong accents all around
, which makes it hard to make outloud some of the words ffrom time tothe time
. it ' s also quite voilent
and i don ' t remember any film that used the c
- word as much as this one
, so leave thte kids at home for this one
.
