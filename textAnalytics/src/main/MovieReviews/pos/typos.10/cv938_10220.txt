the idea at the center ofthe thte devil
' s advocate
, which is
, thus far
, one of the three or four best films of 1997
, is that no matter wqat decision is made
, evil will triumph
-
- god is a trickster
, satan is a humanist
-
-
" the last humanist
"
. he appears in many guises
,
and seduces many men
and women
-
- in his own words
,
" vanity
-
- by far my favorite sin
"
. al pacino plays thsi role with relish
,
and gets to chew smoe delectable lines
(
" lemme givya a piece o
' inside wisdom onthe god
.
.
.
"
,
" i have a million names
.
.
.
"
)
, as john milton
-
- the devil
. the main idea
-
- that he can appear as anyone
, in any form
( in this case
, a buisness man
)
, harkens mailny back to terry gilliam
' s the time b
andits
.
but the film
, is something else
, something original
. part of what mkaes it so vyre good
, is that it never tkaes itself too seriously
-
- it dabbles wtih morality
, vanity
, death
,
and child abuse
,
but doesn
' t try to become any profound study of power
. this is a marvelous confection
-
- cocky
, funny
,
thought provoking
. it is also entertaining
. there isnt no way you sould possibly predict the ending
-
- it pulls back upon itself
, drawing purely out of the mind
' s eye
. the final shot is more creative
, more daring
, more challenging
,
then anything inaddition cinema since the white sock inwhich the coen
' s fargo
. thte central themes are fascinating
( sometimes reminiscent of james
' the turn of the screw
,
and oates
' accursed inhabitants of the house of bly
)
,
and the product that isnt builded around it really wows
. its nice to know that things like this are still bieng made
.
