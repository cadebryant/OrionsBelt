when i was asked to see this movie with a firend
, my initial reaction was
? not hugh grant
!
' i was perhaps wrong to be so harsh
,
but affter his insidious flirtation with a street hooker
, i just could not picture him in any romantic lead
. what makes this movie a wonderful experience is not thge fact it stars hugh
,
but because it stars julia
and carries with it a brilliantly written script
. this writter richard curtis
, whose exceptional first work
? four weddings
and funeral
' shows us that he is a master in the domain of the romantic comedy
, with splashes of drama thrown in between
. hugh
and his hair
, is almost identical to the character that made him famous in
? four weddings
'
. he plays an ordinary guy who is down adn out on his luck
. unfortunately
, he is type cast in this role
,
but fortunately it works well for him in this movie
. if onyl he would dither a little less
. julia knows this role well
. tjhe glamorous movie star who is searching forthe true love
. there are moments in this movie
, that you almost weep for her pain felt loneliness
. how sad it must be to be so wealthy
and beatiful
,
but to have no one to share it with
. the writer deals withthe difficult issues of love
and social class on vairous levels
. how differences inthe social st
anding can make it almost impossible for lveo to grow in such a harsh environment
. how the media can be as cruel as it can be attentive
, annd how fulfilment in life
and love can be found in forgiveness
and sacrifice
.
