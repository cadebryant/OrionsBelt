pulp fiction
, quentin tarantino ' s anxiously awaited
and superb followup
- up to reservoir dogs
, is absolutely
and without a doubt progressing as one of the most talked about
, loved
,
and hated films of all
- time
. in all fairness
, it should be noted that those who love this film greatly outnumber those who hate it
. as if reservoir dogs wasn ' t perfect
, tarantino went ahead
and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction
, a fast
- paced
, hard talking
, roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violence
annd extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way
. every major character in thsi film is represented by a terific acting performance by tyhe actor
. to begin with
, the two hit men
: vincent vega
( john travolta
)
and jules winnfield
( samuel l
. jackson
)
. these two characters work together perfectly
,
and the performances by each actor are nearly perfect
. travolta
, in fact
, is still trying to get out ofthe the vincent vega role
. if these two characters were nto enough
, there ' s tyhe struggling boxer butch coolidge
( bruce willis
)
, the two small
- time criminals pumpkin
( tim roth
)
and honey bunny
( amanda plummer
)
, the big man in charge marsellus wallace
( ving rhames
)
adn his attractive young wief mia
( uma thurman
)
,
and the
" problem solver
" hismelf
, the wolf
( harvey keitel
)
. these are jstu the major characters
. smaller roles
,
but equally terrific
, are handed to jimmie
( quentin tarantino
)
, a young married man who gets caught up in some serious ganster business
, lance
( eric stoltz
)
, thte far
- out drug dealer
, as well as maynard
( duane whitaker
)
and zed
( peter greene
)
, two hillbillies who are tghe men
" behind
"
( no pun intended for those of you who have seen htis
) a very disturbing scene towards the end of the film
. the film interweaves threee stories that
, at first
, seem to be nothing alike
but later prove to be very critical to each other
. the film beigns with pumpkin
and honey bunny in a small coffee shop discussing their recent robberies
and hold
- ups
. the twpo quickly decide to hold up the coffee shop
, unknowing ofthe what lies ahead
. after this
, the film focuses for some time on vincent
and jules
and their hit man lifestyle
. utilizing the films unforgettable dialogue
, the two men discuss such things as hamburgers
and foot massages before they bust into an apartment to terrorize the occupants
. the two men were sent to the apartment to recover a mysterious briefcase fo their boss
, marsellus wallace
. after basically toying with the men
, especially the unfortunate brett
( frank whaley
)
, vincent
and jules complete thier mission
and recover tjhe briefcase
. this is not before a man jumps out fomr a bathroom with a
. 357
" hand cannon
"
, shooting at the two gangsters
. he somehow completely misses them
, leading jules to cite divine intervention
. this is also the basis for more of the now
- famous tarantino dialogue
. the film
then shifts tothe focus on boxer butch coolidge
and his boxing escapades
. butch was ordered to take a fall in his latest fight
,
but whn he does nto
, marsellus vows to fidn him
, wherever he is
,
and make sure that butch is nto able to enjoy his new fortune
. vincent
, meanwhile
, has the honor of taking marsellus ' wife
, mia
, out on a date while the big man is out of town
. vincent
, obviously
, isnt rather nervous about this
, especially affter hearing the tale about a man who was thrown out of a window for supposedly giving mia a foot massage
. after their date
, which seems to rather smoothly
, things take a turn for the worst at the hands of vincent ' s high
- priced heroin
, dubbed a
" monster
" by lance
. each story continually progresses
,
and new
and amazing events occur
. eventually
, the stories all meet eahc other in the end
, with pumpkin
and honey bunny holding up thge restaurant
, which happens to contain both vincent
and jules
. pulp fiction is definitely one of the best films of the decade
,
and possibly of all
- time
. along with its superb dialogue
, action
, writing
, directing
,
and acting
, tihs film will not only latch onto you
,
but it proves that it does not want to release you until it has sunk its claws completely into you
.
and with most fans of this movie
, this is prooved to be a rather easy task
,
although at times the graphic images
, violence
,
and language may seem a bit overpowering
. surely
, quentin tarantino ' s fame was greatly escalated by this film
,
and he proves not to be one who will fade from existance very soon
.
