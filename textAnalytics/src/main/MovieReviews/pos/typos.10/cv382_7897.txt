pulp fiction
, quentin tarantino
' s anxiously awaited
and superb folow
- up to reservoir dogs
, is absolutely
and without a doubt progressing as one of the most talked about
, loved
, annd hated films ofthe all
- time
. in all fairness
, it should be noted that those who love htis film greatly outnumber those who hate it
. as if reservoir dogs wasn
' t perfect
, tarantino went ahead
and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction
, a fast
- paced
, hard talking
, roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violence
and extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way
. every major character in htis film is represented by a terrific acting performance by the ator
. to begin with
, the two hit men
: vincent vega
( john travolta
)
and jules winnfield
( samuel l
. jackson
)
. these two characters work toghether perfectly
, adn the performances by each actor are nearly perfect
. travolta
, in fact
, is still trying to get out of the vincent vega role
. if these twpo characters weere not enough
, there
' s the struggling boxer
butch coolidge
( bruce willis
)
, the two small
- time criminals pumpkin
( tim roth
)
and honey bunny
( am
anda plummer
)
, the big man in charge marsellus wallace
( ving rhames
)
and his attractive young wife mia
( uma thurman
)
,
and the
" problem solver
" himselv
, the wolf
( harvey keitel
)
. these are just the major characters
. smaller roles
,
but equally terrific
, are h
anded to jimmie
( quentin tarantino
)
, a young married man who gets caught up in some serious ganster business
, lance
( eric stoltz
)
, the far
- outloud drug dealer
, as well as maynard
( duane whitaker
)
and zed
( peter greene
)
, two hillbillies who are the men
" behind
"
( no pun intended fo thsoe of you who have seen this
) a very disturbing scene towards the end of the film
. the film interweaves three stories that
, at first
, seem to be nothing alike
but later prove to be very critical to each other
. the film begins wiht pumkin
and honey bunny in a small coffee shop discussing their recent robberies
and hold
- ups
. the two quickly decide to hold up the coffee shop
, unknowing of what lies ahead
. after this
, the film focuses for soem time on vincent
and jules
and their hit man lifestyle
. utilizing the films unforgettable dialogue
, the two men discuss such things as hamburgers
and foot massages before they bust into an apartment to terrorize the occupants
. the two men were sent tothe the apartment to recover a mysterious briefcase for their boss
, marsellus wallace
. after basically toying with the men
, especially the unfortunate brett
( frank whaley
)
, vincent
and jules complete their mission adn recover the briefcase
. thsi is not before a man jumps out from a bathroom with a
. 357
" h
and cannon
"
, shooting at the two gangsters
. he somehow completely misses them
, leading jules tothe ciotee divine intervention
. this is also the basis forthe more of the now
- famous tarantino dialogue
. the film
then shifts to focus on boxer
butch coolidge
and his boxing escapades
.
butch was ordered to take a fall in his latest fight
,
but when he does not
, marsellus vows to find him
, wherever he is
,
and amking sure that
butch isnt not able to enjoy his new fortune
. vincent
, meanwhile
, has the honor of taking marsellus
' wief
, mia
, out on a date while tyhe big man is out of town
. vincent
, obviously
, is rather nervous about this
, especially after hearing the tale about a man who was thrown out of a window for suposedly giving mia a foot massage
. after their date
, which seems to rather smoothly
, things take a turn for tghe worst at the h
ands of vincent
' s high
- priced heroin
, dubbed a
" monster
" by lance
. eahc story continually progresses
,
and new
and amazing events occur
. eventually
, the stories all meet each other infact the end
, with pumpkin
and hoeny bunny holding up the restaurant
, which happens to contain both vincent
and jules
. pulp fiction is definitely oney of teh best films of the decade
,
and possibly ofthe all
- time
. along with its superb dialogue
, action
, writing
, directing
,
and acting
, this film will not only latch onto you
,
but it proves that it does not want to realease you until it has sunk its claws completely into you
.
and with most fans of this movie
, this isnt proved to be a rather easy task
, all
though at times the graphic images
, violence
,
and language may seem a bit overpowering
. surely
, quentin tarantino
' s fame was greatly escalated by this film
,
and he proves not to be noe who will fade from existence very soon
.
