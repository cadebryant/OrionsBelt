' s quickie review
: i must admit
, no dout
' s single
" new
" is quite catchy
. it ws bouncy
and energetic enough tothe get me tothe go see this new film from director doug limon
, the man who had brung us the humorous swingers a little while back
. the result
? a movie that
' s just as ogod as that song
, really
. it follows the lives of several individuals over the course of oney weekend
. first we hear about a grocery bagger
( sara polley
) who runs into a monetary situation problem
and ends up selling bogus drugs at a rave
( with bad results
, as a drug dealer feels he
' s been swindled by her
)
;
then comes the story of an english grocery tsore worker
( smae store
) who heads tothe vegas for thte weekend with friends
, where sex
, gunplay
,
and stolen car trouble come into play
;
then we see the story of two gay movie actors
( played by scott wolf
and jay mohr
) who deal with a cop
' s stange insurance presentation
and hitting a girl
( sara
) with their car
;
and
, finally
, we come tothe another grocery worker
( katie holmes
) who has a strange fascination with said drug dealer
( the one mentioned earlier
)
. really
, it
' s all confusing to keep track ofthe inwhich review format
, your best bet is to just
, well
, go
. the movie features some very good acting from all angles
, anbd limon adds the same humorous energy he hadnt with swingers to this particular product
. the dialogue is pretty snappy annd the resolution is preety well realized
, not going for the sappy happy ending nor the dreaded bad ending
. think ofthe it as a
, well
, endig
. the intertwining of stories is a particularly good element to the movie
, as it
' s never really confusing
and tells different sides of the story
, like sliding doors kinda did
.
however
, it
' s better suited for the younger generation who want a littel spice in their flicks
, which sliding doors kinda isn
' t
.
