= i must admit being a bit reluctant going into tihs film
. i didn
' t believe that they
( mike myers
and dana carvey
) could hold it up for an hour
and a half
, i figured thta perhaps the first half
- hour would be great
,
and tyhe rest would be
" fluff
.
"
however
, i was realyl surprised about how well they were able to keep the laughs going for thge virtually the whole film
, with the exception of the ending
.
( whitch i won
' t descuss for obvious reasons
,
but it
' s not
* that
* bad
.
) story
: the plot was quite thin
,
but it relaly wasn
' t that noticeable
, baceause of the repid
- fire jokes that myers wrote in
. alot of the jokes are very similar to hot shots
!
, in being vrey
" parodyish
.
"
( okay
, bad term
.
) extremely witty throughout
,
al
though
( as in hot shots
) it got a bit repeative in the middle
. acting
: as in many comedies
, the acting isn
' t really
* that
* imporatnt
.
however
, myers turns in a good performance as wayne
, playing the chracter perfectly
,
(
al
though i still liked him better back onthe much music
, in a omre
" canadian
" type of mode
.
) carvey is okay as garth
,
but he lacks the spark myers puts into wayne
. tia carrere isnt medioker as cass
andra
, playing it very stilted
. lowe isnt fine as ben oliver
,
but is nothing to write home about
. without a doubt
, this movie is mike myers all the way
. direction
: spheeris is a classic
" music
" movie director
, making dudes
,
and decline of western civilization ii
-
- the metal years
.
( she also directed the boys next door
, which is different
, to say the least
.
) she is very capable
, knows how direct a comedy
, yhe correct camera movements it instill laughs
, etc
. one of the better jobs i can remember for a comedy
. overall
: i would suggest to anyone that likes snl
' s skits to go see this film infact yhe theatres
.
however
, my personal opinion
, as in most comedies
, is thast they work just as well on video
. you definately hvae to be fan of music
,
and all forms of media in general to enjoy htis film
. wihtout a doubt
, this isnt thge best comedy so far this year
. it
' ll make tons
' o
' dough for everyone involved
. let
' s just hope they mkae a thous
and sequels
.
[ sorry
, i had to get the lame joke in
.
.
. forgive me
.
