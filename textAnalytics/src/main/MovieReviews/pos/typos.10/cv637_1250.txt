= i must admit being a bit reluctant going into this film
. i didn ' t believe that they
( mike myers
and dana carvey
) could hold it up for an hour
and a half
, i figured that prehaps the first half
- hour would be great
,
and the rest would be
" fluff
.
"
howver
, i was raelly surprised about how well they were able to keep the laughs going for the virtually the whole film
, with the exception of the ending
.
( which i won ' t discuss for obvious reasons
,
but it ' s not
* that
* bad
.
) tsory
: tje plot was quite thin
,
but it really wasn ' t that noticeable
, because of the rapid
- fier jokes that myers wroet in
. alot of the jokes are very similar to hot shots
!
, infact being very
" parodyish
.
"
( okay
, bad term
.
) extremely witty throughout
,
although
( as in hot shots
) it got a bit repetitive in the middle
. acting
: as in many comedies
, thte acting isn ' t really
* that
* important
.
however
, myers turns in a good peformance as wayne
, playing the charcter perfectly
,
(
although i still liked him better back onthe much music
, in a moreso
" canadian
" type of mode
.
) carvey is okay as garth
,
but he lacks the spark myers puts into wayne
. tia carrere is medioker as cassandra
, playing it very stilted
. lowe is fine as ben oliver
,
bu is nothing to write home about
. wihtout a doubt
, this movie is mike myers all the way
. direction
: spheeris is a clasic
" music
" movie director
, making dudes
,
and decline of western civilization ii
-
- the metal years
.
( she also directed the boys next door
, hwihc is different
, tothe say the least
.
) she is very capable
, knows how direct a comedy
, tghe correct camera movements it instill laughs
, etc
. one ofthe the better jobs i can remember for a comedy
. overall
: i would suggest to anyone that likes snl ' s skits to go see this film infront the theatres
.
however
, my personal opinion
, as in most comedies
, is tath they work just as well on video
. you definately have to be fan of music
,
and all forms of media in general to enjoy this film
. without a doubt
, this is the best comedy so far this year
. it ' ll make tons ' o ' dough for everyone involved
. let ' s just hope they make a thousand sequels
.
[ sorry
, i had to get the lame joke in
.
.
. forgive me
.
