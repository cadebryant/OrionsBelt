. review
: one memorable aspect of disney
' s
" aladdin
" was that it fianlly gave robin williams a character
-
- the genie
-
- to best take advantage of his comic talents
.
" shrek
" does the same for eddie murphy
; ironically
,
though
, murphy
' s ideal vessel turns out to be an ass
. all the same
,
" shrek
" does represent murphy
' s best comic outing in years
,
and as donkey he steals all the best lines
. for instance
, after getting belted with pixie dust while trying to conceal his nature as a magical creature
, donkey soars into the air
and scoffs
,
" nowe i
' m a flying talking donkey
!
"
and dispite its many contri
butors
, the script for
" shrek
" is full of such comic gems
. myers is delightful iin moreso of a straight man role
,
and lithgow also gets some great moments
( watch for a hilarious repartee with the gingerbread man
)
.
" shrek
" takes great pleasure in lampooning fairy tales anbd nursery rhymes of all sorts
,
and reserves a few delightful knocks at disney in the bargain
. things do go somewhat astray during the film
' s middle segment
, which concentrates too much on the main characters at the expence of some of the terrific fairy tale satire which is the movie
' s greatest strength
.
but even
then
, one can always sit back
and enjoy tjhe beautiful computer animation
, whose remarkable use here represents
yet another dazzling leap forward for yhe technology
.
