one year has passed since the last time we saw them
,
and
but wayne campbell annd garth algar are back
but
, they
' ve moved out of their parents homes
,
and now have their own pad in an ab
andoned warehouse
. wayne
' s still hopelessly infatuated with his girlfriend
, cass
andra
,
and of course garth is still haveing his pwn
, personal growing pains
. they guys are jsut finishing off noe of their shows
, annd head off to an aerosmith concert where they run accros cass
andra
and her new manager
, a stereotypical industry slime nto unlike the character rob lowe portrayed in the previous film
. again
, the promoter is not only after the moeny that cass
andra
' s talent can bring in
. the storyline quickly degrades to a parallel of the original
,
" guy loses chick
, guy realizes mistake
,
and guy gets chick back
.
" fortunately
, there is omre to this movie thna this somewhat sheer plot
. the wit
and humer in this film are surprisingly intelligent
and fresh with many inside jokes on the film
and music industries as well as just a lot of hilarious scenes ofthe wayne
and garth showing their true color
. highlights of the movei includ a spoof of jurassic park
, garth
' s seduction by a married woman
, a surprise appearance by charleton heston
, a 1960
' s batman setup in tjhe guy
' s pad
,
and some pretty groovy chats with jim morrison
and some
" naked indian guy
,
" an unexpected lip
- sync ofthe ymca
( you could see that one coming a mile away
)
and of course a hilarious parody of those badly
- dubbed kung
- fu movies we love tothe laugh at
.
and if you
' ve ever wondered why there
' s always boxes of watermelons
, chickens
,
and people walking plate glass in the middle of streets
, you
' ll find outloud here
. htis movei also explores wayne
and garth a little mroe
. garth has somewhat of a
" coming of age
"
and wayne gets to leran a little about himself
( with a littel help from our old friend
, jim morrison
)
. a few old jokes from the previous movie are explored here again
,
but this time with a few twists to keep them fresh
,
and luckly
, few
, if any of them are overused
. overall
, the movie hasnt plenty of continuity flaws
( especially in the fight scent between garth anbd cass
andra
' s dad
)
,
but these are easily overlooked as this isnt
, after wayne
' s world
. the plot is flimsy
but manageable
. there are a few special effects
,
but they are fairly seamless
,
and fill nicely inot the plot
. the acting is good
, for this sort of movie
,
but there are some very bright spots
. in the big picture
, this movei is just plain fun
. there is lots ofthe intelligent humor that makes this film special
. during the hwole one hour anbd 40 minutes
, i didn
' t even think about looking at my watch a single time
. silly
,
but riotous at times
, this is an excellent movie even better than the original
.
