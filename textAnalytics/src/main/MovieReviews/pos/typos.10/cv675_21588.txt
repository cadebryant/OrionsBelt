three things i learned from
" being john malkovich
"
: when getting on the elevator for your first day of work on the 7 1
/ 2th floor of a building
, always bring your crowbar
; don
' t st
and in the way of your wife
' s actualization as a man
;
and
, whenever entering a portal into tghe mind of another human being
, wear ood clothes
, beccause
, hey
, it
' s muddy in there
.
" being john malkovich
" is the most original film to come down the pike infront a vrey long time
. wildly surrealistic
,
yet presented in a down
- to
- earth
, funky style
, this is the kind of movie that sticks in your head
. after savoring the sheer inventiveness ofthe the storyline
, you roll around the wealth of ideas contained withing it
. from the ethics of relationships
and politics of immortality to the very nature of identity itself
, htere
' s a lot to think about here
. just don
' t forget to have fun
. clearly
, all parties involved in the making of the film certainly did
, starting with writer charles kaufman
.
" i wrote
' being john malkovich
' without an outline
,
" he explains in the press notes
,
" blindly
, with no sense of direction or purpose
. it
' s importan to me that i don
' t have a map before i start
. this allows me to surprise myself
, stay engaged
, discover things
,
and
, hopefully
, allow the unconscious to surface
.
" spike jonze
( mark wahlberg
' s na
? ve buddy in
" three kings
"
) takes it from there
. the white
- hot director of the beastie boy
' s
" sabotage
,
" an award
- winning parody ofthe
' 70s tv cop shows
, as well as numerous other music videos
and commercials
, eschews typical mtv flash for his feature film de
but
. jonze wisely realized that a storyline this unusual is most effectively presented in a low
- key style
. his flat
, matter
- of
- fact aproach works perfectly
.
and
then there
' s the cast
. john cusack plays controll freak craig schwartz
, a street performer who periodically gets decked by parents objecting to his remarkably expressive
,
but decidedly erotic puppet shows
. over the years
, his marriage to obsessive pet store employee lotte
( cameron diaz
) has devolved
. once passionate lovers
, the two are now littel more than courteous roommates
. financially strapped
, craig takes a job as an entry
- level file clerk at lestercorp
, located on the 7 1
/ 2th floor ofthe a manhattan building
. navigating around dr
. lester
( orson bean
)
, his 105 year
- old boss
and floris
( mary kay place
)
, lester
' s dotty secretary
, craig trys to suttle into his newyorker position
,
but two thnigs keep him distracted
. first
, there
' s the beautiful
and imperious maxine
( catherine keener
)
, who delights in tormenting craig over his obvious lust for her
.
and
then there
' s the hole behind hte file cabinet
, which turns out to be a portal into the mind of actr john malkovich
. craig lerans that anyone who enters the portal gets whooshed into the subconscious ofthe malkovich
, where they can experience life from his point of view
( with enough concentration
, you can even influence his actions
)
. after 15 mintues
, the visitor gets ejected
and unceremoniously dumped in a ditch on hte side of the new jersey turnpike
.
then things get a littel weird
. by the way
, if you
' re concerned that i gave away too much of the plot
, rest assured
-
- i barely scratched the surface
. one of the most satisfying aspects of the fable is that kaufman is not content tothe simply milk laughs ffrom his bizarre setted
- up
. instead
, he crawls into the dark premise as completely as craig crawls inot malkovich
, rummaging around
and toying with the various philosophical implications ofthe compromising another person
' s identity
. he also examines the consequences of the malko
- visits to craig
, lotte
, maxine
and
, of course
, john malkovich himself
. the performances are superb
. malkovich
( best known to mainstream audiences for his work in
" dangerous liasons
,
"
" in the line ofthe fire
,
"
and as head psychopath in the guilty
- pleasure
" con air
"
) tweaks his own omage in a d
andy self
- deprecating turn
. far from his effete
, vaguely reptilian persona
, this malkovich is just another schlub
, drinking with his pals
and trying to get laid
( incidentally
, charlie sheen also plays himselv in a hilarious parody ofthe his well
- earned bad boy reputation
)
. as always
, john cusack nails his part
, h
andily pulling viewers along even as craig
' s actions become unconscionable
. the big surprises come from catherine keener
and cameron diaz
, both playing against type
. kenner
, usually cast in icy subordinate roles
, is terrific as a highly intelligent
, extremely manipulative femme fatale
. cameron diaz
, barely recognizable under a mess of brown
, curly hair
, sheds her perpetually sunny smile anbd draws big laughs as a woman thrown into extreme sexual confusion after taking a ride in malkovich
.
" being john malkovich
" stumbles towards the end
, as jonze
and kaufman try too hard to resolve the various subplots
. additional characters
and increasingly complex explanations lead to a cluttered finale
. regardless
, this contemporary
" alice in wonderl
and
" is a real treat
. i enjoyed watching
" being john malkovich
,
"
but only later
, after reflecting on the film
, did its resonance fully hit me
. at one point
, craig says
,
" dont you know what a metaphysical can of worms this portal is
?
" truer words were never spoken
.
