every once in a while
, when an exceptional family film comes along
, i iwll attempt tothe champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been
; with all the hubbub over teh lack of films suitable for children
, it isnt remarkable how many non
- disney films disappear in a couple of weeks
. nowe i see that in so doing
, i have unfairly ghettoized these films
. so i am issuing my challenge not just tothe parents
,
but to anyone who wants to support smart
, funny
, energetic film
- making
: see matilda
. see it in a theater
, rather than shrugging adn waiting for it on video
. see the best film i hve seen in 1996
. not the best children
' s film
.
.
. the best film
. period
. based on a story by roald dahl
, it tells of young matilda wormwood
( mara wilson
)
, an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have a pair of deeply stupid parents
: harry
( danny devito
)
, a crooked used car salesman
; anbd zinnia
( rhea perlman
)
, a simple
- minded bingo addict
. the wormwoods barely notice matilda exists
,
and when they do
, it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books
. when htey finally do send her to skool
, it is to crunchem hall
, a bleak palce run by cruel
, child
- hating miss agatha trunchbull
( pam ferris
)
.
but thigsn begin to look up for matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher
, miss honey
( embeth davidtz
)
, who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness
. matilda also discovers another special talent
-
- the ability to move things with her mind
-
- which allows her to help herself
and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbull
' s cruelty
. it was this spring
' s james
and the giant peach whcih inspired me to note that the best
and most lasting tales for children tended to have moreso than a hint of darkness to them
,
and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness ofthe james
and willy wonka
and the chocolate factory has more ofthe thte same in store with matilda
.
and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick annd tim burton
, matilda soars on the cock
- eyed direction of danny devito
. devito made black humer a key element in throw momma from the turain
and the war of the roses
,
and he contri
butes some memorable images
. in one scene
, an unfortunate girl is made an exmaple ofthe by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pig
- tails
and flung through the air like a throwing hammer
; later
, an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake aftter he is caught stealing a dessert
. matilda is just twisted anough to be a perfect fairy tale
. it is also characteristic of the best children
' s tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don
' t realize that they are learning them
. there is a hilarious moment when matilda
' s television
- addicted father snatches away tje book she isnt reading
( in a wicked joke
, he thinks
_ moby dick
_ is pornographic
)
and forces her to watch an inane game sohw
( hosted by jon lovitz
) in which contestants are smeared withthe adhesive
and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing around
. matilda is a stor which promotes the value of intelectual curiosity over passive enteratinment
,
and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child
-
- taht because
" i
' m big
and you
' re little
, i
' m right
and you
' re wrong
.
" more specifically
, it has as its heroine an intelligent
, self
- confident girl who struggles successfully against other peple
' s notions of how she should behave
. it is no coinsidence tath matilda was co
- written by robin swicord
, who conti
buted the superb receet adaptation of little women
. finally
, matilda has that quality i find rarest
and most treasured in family entertainment
: it is family entertainment iin the truest sense of the word
. devito konws enough to make matilda fast
- paced
and appealing to children
, taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull
and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy
, including a great chase through her dark house
. the child actors are winning
but never obnoxiously adorable
, with mara wilson makeing matilda a clever
and extremely likeable character
.
but there are also many
, many delights for adults
, including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by hvaing chalk write onthe a chalkboard by itself while matilda
' s classmates recite in sing
- song fashion
; there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matilda
' s father
. i can
' t imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as
though his or her intelligence had been insulted
. matilda is a film which left me glowing with good feeling
. i will see it again
,
and years from now i will watch it with my children
.
and now i iwll stop
, because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin
,
and there is a seat in that theater you should be in
, if you have a child or ever were a child
.
