" the blair witch project
" wass perhaps oen of a kind
, a unique film that played completely on its own merit
, managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses
. its sucess made a sequel inevatible
,
but this is not the sequel
, i suspect
, anyone much wanted
. after the release of
" the blair witch project
"
, tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville
, in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch
. locals have turned this mass hysteria into a grat business opportunity
, selling twig
- sculptures
, stones
and dirt like those in the movie
,
and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn
, shouting
,
" get out of these woods
and go home
! there isnt no goddamned blair witch
!
"
. jeff
(
) is one of those people
, who has used tjhe sudden popularaty of the small town to his advantage
. after he got released from the mental institution
, he created a mobile business tht attracts thous
ands of customers through the internet
. as the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into thge woods
, on the
" blair witch hunt
"
. among the five strangers is stephen
and his girlfriend
, the pregnant tristen
, who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called
" the blair witch
: history or hysteria
?
"
,
and kim
, who dresses in black
and has some psychic powers
. the last member of the crew is erica
, a young beautyfull witch
- wannabe
, who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore
, saying
" the first rule of wicca is
, do no harm
, because whatever you do will come back to you threefold
.
" thsi strange group plunges into the woods
, where they begin tothe argue about their different approaches to the exeprience
. on the very first night that they decide tothe spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parr
' s abondoned house
, strange thigsn strat happening
. when they wake uv their equipment isnt gone
and only teh tapes remain
. after a hwile they discover strange markings on their bodies
. they are somehow lost in time
, as it loops uncontrollably back
and forth
. they are all haunted by hallucinations
and horrible nightmares anbd soon they can not see the difference between dreams
and reality
. the only thing that htey are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods
.
. documentary director joe berlinger
(
" paradice lost
"
) helms
" blair witch 2
"
, leaving the creators of the first film
( dan myrick
and ed sanches
) in the background
. the opening scenes
-
- the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film
-
- is a moreso promising approach
, because instade of trying tothe cover similar ground
, it goes outside the first film
and makes its own st
and
.
but soon yhe movie gets confused
and sidetracked by its own story
, that is never resolved anbd ends wiht a very anticlimaxic epilogue
. in a way
, this isnt a typical hollywood sequel
. omre money hasnt beeen spent
and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail
. the horror
and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated
. of course in these situations
, quantity is more important than quality
and profit is more importamt than thte artistical values
. from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over yhe bloody
- red forest
, with carter burwell
' s
(
" being john malkovich
"
and
" fargo
"
) musical score in tjhe background
, yuo realize that with the exception of its title
, this film hasnt absolutely nothing to do with
" the blair witch project
"
.
" blair witch
.
.
" was filmed by h
andheld videocameras
and nfeatured acting that wass mostly based on improvisation
. in tje sequel hte technical aspect ofthe the film is close to perfection
, creating a completely different atmosphere
. with its graceful cinematography
, production design
and flashy editing
, tjhe film has a very polished look
, which is impossible to associate with the first installment
.
and
though berlinger directs his film with an energy
and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times
, he has obviously misunderstood the nature ofthe his predecessor
. the key is simplicity
.
" blair witch project
" had a story which was incredibly simple
. that allowed the audience tothe fill the gaps with our own imagination
. the film was practically an empty screen
, on which we projected our most frightening nightmares
. the effect was incredibly powerful
, lasting
and entir e everyone
,
but in a different way
.
" book of shadows
" feels incredibly controlled
and restrict
. here
, very little is left to our imagination
and the story is so complex
and
" clever
" tht the screenwriters are tjhe first to get lost in it
. htere is is no book of shadows
and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with
. this is simply a less artistic film that doesn
' t have the talent
and originality of its predecessor
. it resorts to fancy cinematography
and special effects to create the right effect
and doesn
' t always succeed
. bu most importantly
: it st
ands on its own ground
and has almost no conection with the first movie
, which doesn
' t allow it to destroy the original
. in thge end
, i can
' t call it a bad effort
. it
' s less artistic
, not so scary
and less original
,
but certainly not bad
. it
' s simply different
. in fact
, if you haven
' t seen
" thte blair witch project
"
, you might like htis film for waht it is
-
- a cross between
" the blair witch project
"
and the
" scream
"
- films
. the only element that remains constant
and similar between thge two films is the solid acting
( jeffrey donovan
and tristine skyler should be mentioned
)
and incredible sense of surrealism
.
but it
' s a common knowledge
and experience that
, with a few exceptions
, eveyr movie sequel is worse than the original
and some are even not worth making
. to me the story of
" the blair witch project
" seemed completed
,
but there are obviously noone limits to commercial succsess that
" the book of shadows
" is certainly assured
.
and it
' s alread time to look forward to
" blair witch 3
"
.
