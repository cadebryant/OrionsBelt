warning
: anyone offended by blatant
, leering machismo had better avoid tihs film
. or lots of blood
& guts
, men agianst men
and mano
- et
- mano stuff
. in other words
, it
' s a walter hill film
! with a john milius script
! i always picture these guys getting together adn producing a movie beetwen arm
- wrestling matches
. these films always contain male characters i have a vyer hard time identifying with
, probably due tothe the likelihood that any meeting between them
and me would result in my arm being ripped off
and
then my subsequent death by beating with said limb
.
and we got tough guys galore
, here
; drug
- running b
anditos by the dozens
, all dirty
and sweaty anbd pretty ill
- tempered
, overall
; a secret task force of army com
andos who are in the area to cover
- up
( supposedly
) any connection between the government
and the drug runners
;
and lots of shit
- kicking texas dirt farmers who
' d as soon shoot you beween the eyes as look at you
. in particular
, we got nick nolte as one hard
- ass texas ranger
, powers boothe as the drug kingpin
, michael ironsides as teh leader of the secret army
,
and rip torn as tyhe local sheriff
. torn is the sympathetic figure ofthe the group
; he smiles before shooting anyone
. as to women
.
.
. well
, i
' ve never seen jane fonda or meryl streep in a walter hill film
,
and at this rate
, i doubt i ever will
. women exist here to look good
, comfort hte man
,
and get argued over
. gosh
! just like the old days
.
.
. frankly
, this is a preety good movie
, if you cant accept the premise
and can take the macho sutff
. the cinematography is excellent
, the cast of characters is broad
and hasnt texture
, tyhe script is quite good
,
and the film lets ytou keep up with what
' s happening yourself
, without spelling it out tothe you
. i appreciate a film that makes me have tothe think to keep up
. finally
, htere
' s lots of sam peckinpah slow
- motion shoot
- ups
.
