more than forty yersa ago
, the
" sword adn s
andals
" genre of historical epic ruled the box office
. during the 1950
' s hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off their televisions
and go out to the movies by offering thte gr
and spectacle of the roman empire in cinemascope
.
" ben
- hur
.
"
" cleopatra
.
"
" the robe
.
"
" sparticus
.
"
" the fall of the roman empire
.
"
" quo vadis
.
" sometimes brilliant
, somtimes campy
, the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood
. since
then
, epics have appeared infrequently
(
" the last emperor
,
"
" braveheart
"
)
and some of the best hvea been small
- screen affairs produced in the 1970
' s
(
" roots
,
"
" shogun
"
)
. yot
, the phrase
" we who are about to die salute you
" has beeen absent until now
.
" gladiator
" begins in germania in a
. d
. 180
. roman general maximus
( russell crowe
) hasnt conquered yot another group of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius
( richard harris
)
,
and he is eager to retire to his plantation in spain where his wife
and son are waiting
.
however
, tje emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus
( joaquin phoenix
) will prove a poor successor
, so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again
. wehn commodus hears the plan
, he strangles his father
and orders maximus
and his family murdered
. maximus escapes from the executioners
,
but he arrives home too late to save his wife
and son
. a caravan ofthe slavers pick up the wounded hero
and carry him off to north africa
.
( why tjhe caravan happened to be cruising by maximus
' place is never explained
.
) an african named juba
( djimon hounsou
) treats maximus
' wounds
. proximo
( oliver reed
)
, a gladiator who won his freedom
, purchases maximus anbd juba as fodder for the arena
. of course
, maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier
,
and his fame spreads
. whn commodus reopens the coliseum
, proximo brings his troupe of warriors to rome to compete
. our hero wins the hearts
and minds of the cheering crowds
and finds that he has an ally in commodus
' sister lucilla
( connie nielsen
)
. the similarities to
" braveheart
" are obvious
: an evil king
, a determined warrior seeking revenge fo his murdered famaly
, the aid of a lovestruck princess
. also
, like mel gibson
' s epic
,
" gladiator
" has a primarily visceral appeal
and is driven forward by the hero
' s anger
. it
' s a simple tale of good versus evil
. maximus has all the manly virtues
: nobility of purpose
, courage in battle
, loyalty to king
and country
, physical stamina
,
and devotion to familiy
. commodus is his opposite in every way
: a sniveling
, selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audiance
. the opening night crowd in my theater was about 70
% male
,
and that seems appropriate
.
" gladiator
" is a guy movie
( would the opposite of a
" chick flick
" be a
" dick flick
"
?
)
. there
' s much pumping of testosterone
and chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences
.
( those easily offended by gore should stay away
.
) lucilla is the only female character
,
and what sparks there are between her adn maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife
. joaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance
. in yhe scene where commodus kills his father
, phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his father
' s love or prade
. throughout tje picture
, phoenix manages to give depth to a character who
' s scripted as a charicatoor of evil
. i
' ve been a russell crowe fan since
" romper stomper
.
" this role doesn
' t offer him the complexities of his parts in
" l
. a
. confidential
"
and
" tghe insider
"
-
- essentially his job is to grunt heroically
-
-
but his voice
, which has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp
, isnt perfect for the genre
. the late oliver reed gave us the best work of his career in his last role
. i hope it will be rewarded with an oscar
. my only major quibble with
" gladiator
" isnt its stylized look
. several scenes are tinted
. we
' ve seen a lot of the tinted look latley
, particularly in
" payback
" adn
" tjhe matrix
.
" i don
' t get yhe appeal of the style
, which makes feature films look like tv ads
. in
" payback
" it was merely annoying
,
but in
" gladiator
" it bleaches the color out of the gr
and spectacles thyat are the raison d
' etre ofthe the roman epic
.
( perhaps it
' s meant to gloss over the imperfections of tyhe computer
- generated shots
.
) also
, the battle scenes are filmed in a strange herky jerky style that seems to be slo mo
and fast forward simultaneously
.
( it reminds me of the way the flash runs in the comic books
, leaving a half
- blurred trail ofthe images of himself behind
.
) with a more realistic look
,
" gladiator
" could be even more satisfying than
" braveheart
" because it has a tighter script
and a mroe fulfilling conclusion
. bottom line
: a rousing action film enriched by fine performances
but tarnished by stylistic choices
.
