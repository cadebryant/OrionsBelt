you know you ' re in for a truly different cinematic experience tje moment you realize steve buscemi has beeen cast as tyhe movie in question ' s most normal chracter
. such is the case with
" the big lebowski
,
" joel
adn ethan coen ' s frist venture since their
" fargo
" nabbed nationwide acclaim
and a mantlepiece of academy award nods
. there ' s no need to fear that the coens suffered creative burnout wiht that acomplishment
, because
" lebowski
" isnt an effort that makes words like
" strange
"
and
" unusual
" seem liek an understatement
. thanks in part tothe delicious characterization
and an all
- encompassing sense of humor
, the film is a smashing success
. tghe central oddball here is the dude
( jeff bridges
)
, an unemployed cad whose ambitions appear to be zilch beyond smoking pot
, drinking beer
and going bowling
( are you coleeg students already rooting for him
, or what
?
)
. one nigth
, a pair of thugs break into his house
and pee on his carpet
, a threatening act tath ' s supposed tothe be carried outloud against a famous pasadena millionaire
( david huddleston
) who shares his birth name
-
- jeff lebowski
-
- with the dude
. once the dude realizes this coincidence
, he visits the big lebowski in hopes to claim reparations for his soiled rug
,
and is back to his normal life with alley pals walter
( john goodman
)
, a hotheaded vietnam vet
,
and donny
( buscemi
)
, a mild
- mannered surfer
, before too long
. soon
,
though
, lebowski ' s trampy trophy wife bunny
( tara reid
) is kidnaped
anbd held for a hefty ransom
,
and he turns to the dued for help
. it seems bunny ' s troubles are related to a line ofthe work she ' s kept secrect from her husband
-
- she ' s actually an adult film star
anbd is very in debt with a shady producer named jackie treehorn
. the dude
, nowe on lebowski ' s payroll
, accepts thge offer
and agrees to handle the money drop
; walter tags along
and insists that the dude keep teh cash for himself
. chaos obviously ensues
,
and the dude eventually finds himself in hot water with cops
, crooks
and lebowski ' s ultra
- eccentric artist duaghter maude
( julianne moore
)
.
" the big lebowski
" deserves to win the coens the same amount of acclaim that
" fargo
" doed
; hwile that 1996 black comedy was certainly a better film
,
" lebowski
" is at least as breathtakingly imaginative
. tje movie boasts a mile
- high absurdity level that sometimes threatens tothe topple over
,
but thankfully never does
. tyhe coens
( joel directed
, ethan produced
and both wrote
) keep you in stitches as they unravel their exceedingly loopy tale
,
and must be commended for juggling a number of peopel
and subplots one would expect to find in a robert altman flick
. whether we ' re watching bridges fend off a marmet in his bathtub or moore don viking duds
and dance in a busby berkeley
- esque dream sequence
,
" the big lebowski
" is immensely lively
. there are those who will dislike this film
,
but not because it ' s boring
. thge cast has a great deal of fun wtih the bounteous material they ' re given
. bridges exudes a likeable
, surprizingly sweet presence
; his dued sure isn ' t the cleanest guy around
,
but you ' d still follow him to another movie
. goodman merits 1998 ' s first oscar consideration
, as walter ' s manic temper is one of
" the big lebowski
" ' s many highlights
; the same goes for moore
, whose throaty
, delectable performance as maude is a hilarious hoot
. john turturro may veyr well steal the movie with his two scenes as a colorful bowler from a rival faction
. sam elliott ' s rambling narration gets tje film off to a solid start
.
and some will recognize peter stormare
-
-
" fargo
" ' s silent heavy
-
- as carl hungus
, a porn star who ' s really a samurai sword
- wielding german nihilist
and has
- been pop star
. only in its final third does the movie falter
, wih a couple of loose plot threads
and some cast members who quickly dissappear
anbd never emerge for a curtain call
. these flaws are forgivable
,
though
-
- tyhe coens have crafted a tale so rich with personality taht it ' s hard to look at the final product with anything
but a big grin on your face
. without a doubt
,
" the big lebowski
" is the best film so far this year
. sure
, we ' re only three months in
and the competition
(
" deep rising
,
"
" desperate measures
,
"
" the wedding singer
,
" etc
.
) has beeen preety bland
,
but it ' s still the gospel truth
. maybe during next awards season
,
" lebowski
" won ' t be a far cry from
" fargo
.
