you know you
' re inwhich forthe a truley diffrent cinematic experience the moment you realize steve buscemi has been cast as the movie in question
' s most normal character
. such is the case with
" the big lebowski
,
" joel
and ethan coen
' s first venture since their
" fargo
" nabbed nationwide acclaim
and a mantlepiece of academy award nods
. htere
' s no need to fear that the coens suffered creative burnout with that accomplishment
, because
" lebowski
" is an effort that makes words like
" stange
"
and
" unusual
" seem like an understatement
. thanks in part to delicious characterization
and an all
- encompassing sense of humor
, yhe film is a smashing success
. yhe central oddball here is the dude
( jeff bridges
)
, an unemployed cad whose ambitions appear to be zilch beyond smoking pot
, drinking beer
and going bowling
( are you college students already rooting fo him
, or what
?
)
. one night
, a pair of thugs break inot his house
and pee on his carpet
, a threatening act that
' s supposed to be carried out against a famouse pasadena millionaire
( david huddleston
) who shares his birth name
-
- jeff lebowski
-
- with the dued
. once the dude realizes this coinsidence
, he visits the big lebowski in hopes to claim reparations forthe his soiled rug
,
and is back to his normal life with alley pals walter
( john goodman
)
, a hotheaded vietnam vet
,
and donny
( buscemi
)
, a mild
- mannered surfer
, before too long
. soon
,
though
, lebowski
' s trampy trophy wife bunny
( tara reid
) is kidnaped
and held for a hefty ransom
,
and he turns to the dued for help
. it seems bunny
' s troubles are related to a line of work she
' s kept secret from her husb
and
-
- she
' s actually an adult film star adn is very in debt witht a shady producer named jackie treehorn
. the dued
, now on lebowski
' s payroll
, accepts the offer
and agrees tothe h
andle the money drop
; walter tags along
and insists that the dude keep the cash for himself
. chaos obviously ensues
,
and the dude eventually finds himself in hot water with cops
, crooks
and lebowski
' s ultra
- eccentric artist daughter maude
( julianne moore
)
.
" the big lebowski
" deserves to win the coens the same amount of acclaim that
" fargo
" did
; hwile that 1996 black comedy was certainly a better film
,
" lebowski
" is at least as breathtakingly imaginative
. the movie boasts a mile
- high absurdity level that sometimes threatens to topple over
,
but thankfully never does
. the coens
( joel directed
, ethan produced
and both wroet
) keep you in stitches as they unravel their exceedingly loopy tale
,
and must be commended fo juggling a number of people
and subplots one would expect to fidn infront a robert altman flick
. whether we
' re watching bridges fend off a marmet in his bathtub or moore don viking duds
and dance in a busby berkeley
- esque dream sequence
,
" the big lebowski
" is immensely lively
. there are those who will dislike this film
,
but not becasue it
' s boring
. the cast has a great deal of fun with the bounteous material they
' re given
. bridges exudes a likeable
, surprisingly sweet presence
; his dude sure isn
' t the cleanest guy around
,
but you
' d still follow him to another movie
. goodman merits 1998
' s first oscar consideration
, as walter
' s manic temper is one of
" the big lebowski
"
' s many highlights
; the same goes for moore
, whose throaty
, delectable performance as maude is a hilarious hoot
. john turturro may very well steal the movie with his two scenes as a colorful bowler from a rival faction
. sam elliott
' s rambling narration gets thte film off to a solid start
.
and some will recognize peter stormare
-
-
" fargo
"
' s silent heavy
-
- as carl hungus
, a porn star who
' s really a samurai sword
- wielding german nihilist
and has
- been pop star
. only in its final third does the movei falter
, with a couple of loose plot threads
and some cast members who quickly disappear
and never emerge for a curtain call
. these flaws are forgivable
,
though
-
- the coens have crafted a tale so rich with personality that it
' s hard to look at the final product withthe anything
but a big grin on your face
. without a doubt
,
" the big lebowski
" is the best film so far this year
. sure
, we
' re only three months in
and the competition
(
" deepo rising
,
"
" desperate measures
,
"
" the wedding singer
,
" etc
.
) hasnt been pretty bl
and
,
but it
' s still the gospel truth
. maybe during next awards season
,
" lebowski
" won
' t be a far cry from
" fargo
.
