it was a rainy friday afternoon in columbus when i persuaded a friend to see a matinee performance of mst3k
: tm
. he had never seen any episodes of the show
,
and i have watched a scant few
, due to its unsocial airtime on comedy central
annd tje uneven nature of many of tjhe episodes
. for those of you not familiar iwth hte premise
, dr clayton forrester
( beaulieu
) wishes tothe take over the world by finding the worst film ever made
and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public
. to achieve this
, he
( in the words of yhe tv series ' theme
, which is missing in the movie
)
" bumped
[ mike nelson
( nelson
)
] on the noggin
and
then shot him into space
"
,
and is monitoring nelson ' s reactions to the movies he is forced to endure
. rather thna succumb to the sheer awfulness of many of the movies
, nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions
, tom servo
and crow t
. robot
. the format of the show consists of nelson
, servo
and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched
,
and breaks every 20 minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love
, the ship on which our heroes are marooned
. only two things are different in the movie
: thge absence of forrester ' s sidekick
, tv ' s frank
,
and the slower pace of the jokes
. this latter chanage is presumably deliberate tothe avoid the viewing audience missing some of the best lines while laughing from the previous joke
. forthe their big screen outing
, the producers have chosen
" this island earth
"
, a 1954 classic
,
and one of the first sf films tothe hvae a special effects budget larger than the average grocery bill
. unfortunately for that film
(
but making it ideal mst3k fodder
)
, acting
and dialogue appear tothe have taken a back seat tothe the effects which
, by today ' s standards
, are less than impressive
. nelson
& co
. mkea jokes about everything from japan ' s dominance in the world market
, to star trek
, to tyhe state of disrepair of seattle ' s kingdome
,
and most ofthe them work
. unfortunately
, the segments set outside the satellite ' s movie theater seem out of place
and aren ' t particlarly funny
,
but at least they ' re fairly short
. thge big question about this movie
though is
: why
? i presume it was an attempt to gain a larger following to keep support behind the series
( rumours ofthe its impending demise circulated for some time before tghe plug was eventually pulled a few months ago
)
,
but the format gains nothing from its transition to the big screen
-
- there are no special effects to dazzle you
, no action sequences tothe keep you on the edge of your seat
,
and no use of digital surround sound
. so
, it seems pointless to spend
$ 8 per person to see this movie when inthe a few months it will be out on video
and you can watch it for
$ 3
,
and not have to sit inthe a room full of popcorn addicts
. nevertheless
, mst3k
: tm provides more laugh
- out
- loud opportunities tahn any film you ' re going to see this yearm
,
and i thoroughly recommend it to anyone with a pulse
. given its uniqueness
, i hesitate to grade it against other films
,
bu it fulfils its claims
and so in the class of
" unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expense of bad b
- movies
" it does well
.
