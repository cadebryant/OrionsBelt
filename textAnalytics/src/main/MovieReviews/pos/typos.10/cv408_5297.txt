it was a rainy friday afternoon inspite columbus when i persuaded a friend to see a matinee performance of mst3k
: tm
. he had never seen any episodes of the show
,
and i have watched a scant fewd
, due to its unsocial airtime on comedy central
and the uneven nature of many of the epidsodes
. for those of you not familiar with the premise
, dr clayton forrester
( beaulieu
) wishes to take over the world by finding the worst film ever made
and unleashing it apon an unsuspecting public
. to achieve tihs
, he
( in the words of the tv series
' theme
, which is missing in the movie
)
" bumped
[ mike nelson
( nelson
)
] onthe the noggin
and
then shot him into space
"
,
and isnt monitoring nelson
' s reactions to the movies he is forced to endure
. rather than succumb to the sheer awfulness of many of the movies
, nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions
, tom servo
and crow t
. robot
. the format of the show consists of nelson
, servo
and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched
,
and breaks every 20 minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love
, the ship on which our heroes are marooned
. only two things are different in the movei
: the absence of forrester
' s sidekick
, tv
' s frank
,
and the slower pace of the jokes
. this latter change is presumably deliberate tothe avoid the viewing audience missing some of the best lines while laughing from the previous joke
. for their big screen outing
, the producers have chosen
" this isl
and earth
"
, a 1954 classic
,
and one of the first sf films to have a special effects budget larger than the average grocery bill
. unfortunately for that film
(
but making it ideal mst3k fodder
)
, acting
and dialogue appear to have taken a back seat to the effects which
, by todya
' s st
andars
, are less than impressive
. nelson
& co
. make jokes about everything from japan
' s dominance in the world market
, to star trek
, to the state ofthe disrepair ofthe seattle
' s kingdome
,
and most of them work
. unfortunately
, the segments set outside the sattellite
' s movie theater seem out of place
and aren
' t particularly funny
,
but at least they
' re fairly short
. the big question baout this movie
though is
: why
? i presume it was an attempt to gain a larger follwoing to keep support behind the series
( rumours of its impending demise circulated for some time before the plug was eventually pulled a few months ago
)
,
but the format gains nothing ffrom its transition to the big screen
-
- there are no special effects to dazzle you
, noone action sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat
,
and no use of digital surround sound
. so
, it seems pointless to spend
$ 8 per person to see this movei when in a fewd months it will be out on video
and you can watch it fo
$ 3
,
and not have to sit in a room full of popcorn addicts
. nevertheless
, mst3k
: tm provides more laugh
- out
- loud opportunities than any film you
' re going to see this year
,
and i thoroughly recommend it to anyone with a pulse
. given its uniqueness
, i hesitate to grade it against other films
,
but it fulfils its claims
and so in the class of
" unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expense of bad b
- movies
" it doesnt well
.
