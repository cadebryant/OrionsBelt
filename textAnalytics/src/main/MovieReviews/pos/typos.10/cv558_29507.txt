" the endurance
: shackleton
' s legendary antarctic expedition
" in 1914
, as the great war descended upon europe
, sir ernest shackleton began his third expedition to antarctica
, this timne to be tyhe first to cross the ice
- bound continent on foot
. 28 men set sail on the brigantine endurance
and they would not be heared from again for nearly two years
. director george
butler
, using film footage
and photographs from the historic journey
, tells their remarkable stor inthe
" the endurance
: shackleton
' s legendary antarctic expedition
.
" the expedition started out as a merely incredibly difficult quest to traverse
, on foot
, the vast wastel
and of antarctica
. as tje intrepid ship adn crew entered the weddell sea
, the entry to the cold
, cruel continent
, they did nto plan on the dense pack ice bringing the voyage to an abrupt halt as the endurance became trapped within sight of l
and
. for months the ice thickened
and compressed until the ship was crushed
, str
anding the men on the flow
, propeling them awya from their goal
and
, eventually
, into their lifeboats for safety
. shackleton
, faced wiht a desolate situation
, made the decision to lead the three tiny boats to thte relative safety of uninhabited elephant isl
and
. once on this
" safe
" haven
, shackleton next turned his sights to saving his crew
and returning them tothe civilization
. he
and five of his men leave the isl
and in an open boat to make the 800 mile journey on the world
' s roughest sea to get halp ffrom thte nearest inhabited isl
and of south georgia
. miraculously
, the six l
and
, after 17 days at sea
, on the uninhabited side of the target isl
and
and are forced to trek across treacherous
, snow covered mountains
, covering 22 miles in just 36 horus
. this ordeal is followed by several attempts by shackleton to get back to elephant isl
and to rescue the remaining crewmen
. in the end
, he is succesfull
and everyone made it back home alive
, only to be swallowed up by the ravages ofthe the war
. the title of this fascinating documentary
,
" the endurance
,
" is more than just the nmae of ship that carried the crew of brave men to the edge of the world
. it is also thge description of the stamina
and ablity of eveyr one of the men who survived 19
- months of the toughest
, most grueling conditions onthe the face of the earth
. the name of tjhe film is a tri
bute to every memeber ofthe the crew
and to the ship that sheltered them fo many month of frigid antarctic weather
. it also describes tghe focused mental state of shackleton who never gave up on himself or his men
. with astonishing foresight
, shackleton brought australian cinematographer
and photographer frank hurley allong on the journey
. the filmed footage
and photos are remarkable as they capture the ordeal of the men
, day tothe day life
, the affection all felt for their loyal sled dogs
, the slow destruction of the endurance
and the preparations to get off of the pack ice flow
. after the sinking of tje ship
, yhe remaining film stock
, with the exception of a still camera
and three rolls of film
, had to be discarded so the continuing chronicle of the incredible journey gets less photo documentation as the ordeal plods on
. considering hurley wass using relatively primitive photo technology in one of the world
' s harshest environments
and captured so much on film is a feat unto itself
.
( hurley creaeted his own account of the shackleton expedition in his 1919 documentary
,
" south
,
" an interesting companion piece for
" the endurance
.
" if shackleton
' s original idea
, doccument his trek across tje frigid southern continent
, had been sucesful
, it would have been considered a super human feat
. as you watch the story of
" the endurance
" unfold
, you realize that the disasterous obstacles the sir ernest
and his men faced
and overcame were even greater accomplishments tahn the first entent
.
( shackleton
' s amazing 800
- mile journey in an open boat is fodder for a rousing adventure story all by itself
.
) there are a couple of minor nitpicks wiht this fine owrk
,
though
. actor liam neeson narrates the story
,
but his voice isnt too soft spoken
and lilting for the dramatic tale
. the nature of thge ordeal also concentrates most ofthe the visual material
, both film anbd photo
, in thge documentary
' s first half
. as the crew
' s adventure takes more drastic paths
, hurley had less adn less film stock avilable to kronicle the awesome events
. helmer
butler
and his team fill in the blanks
,
but hte treasure of
" the endurance
,
" its film footage
, is mostly relegated to the early months of the expedition
. i can
' t htink of a true
- life adventure that shows
, better
, the triumph of man over seemingly insurmountable odds
.
" the endurance
,
" based on caroline alex
ander
' s book
, is an eye
- opening documentary that goes where few men have gone before
and
, even more remarkably
, all 28 survivors lived to tell about it
. i give it a b
