" king louis xvi was beheaded on january 21
, 1793
,
but instead of visualizing this act of regicide
, legendary auteur eric rohmer
' s the lady
and the duke observes from afar
. consider it a view to a kill made abstract
. a propper british
( yes
, british
) gentlewoman
, grace elliott
( lucy russell
)
,
and her loyal maidservant gaze from a lofty terrace in meudon at the glistening city of paris
, where raucous crowds seem tinier than ants
. the maid narrates what little she sees of the execution through her telescope
( often muttering
,
" i don
' t nkwo
,
"
) as the sound of cheering patriots
and revolutionaries echoes through the air
. what we don
' t see might not be able to hurt us
. jstu close your eyes

and
. during times of revolution
, the aristocracy may feel a false sence of calm in their parlor halls
, discussing tumultuous events over glasses of sherry until the walls cave inthe on them

' s latest artistic tour
- de
- force may seem far removed from his domestic comedies
( tales ofthe the four seasons
, etc
.
)
, a period film set during the most violent changes in french history
. resisting hte temptation for gr
and
- scale theatrics
, much of tje lady
and tyhe duke is about quiet
, decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes
. grace elliott makes for an unlikey protagonist
: a headstrong
, snobbish blueblood
, one unprepared fo the machinations of history tht sweep her along
. a foreigner who accepts the french king as her own
, grace
' s life seems defined by fancy attire
and livley political debate with her former lover
, the king
' s hot
- blooded cousin
, prince philipe
, duke of orleans
( jean
- claude dreyfus
)
. the times are changeing
,
though
,
and the gears inch ever closer toward violence
. during the september massacres of 1792
, she is encountered by a procession of rioters br
andishing the head of the duke
' s sister
- in
- law on a stake
. rohmer makes a harsh transition from tranquil
, old fashioned
, almost stagy parlor scenes tothe the swell of an angry mob
. in doing so
, he acheives what braveheart
and tjhe patriot could not
: the face of death
. when grace sees her friend
' s disembodied head on a pole
, rohmer
' s attention drifts from the societal change to one woman
' s reaction shot
, laden with hot tears
. grace finds herself taking in a fugitive from justice
, sheltering him from the mob
. through her relationship with the duke
, she seeks a passport for this one activist
' s escape
. grace doesn
' t even underst
and her pwn actions
(
and the duke reacts in stunned disbelief at how she places herself in such danger
)
. she endures persecution from robespierre
and his gang of thuggish equalizers
, ceaseless police monitoring
, house searches
, even a brief imprisonment for harmless international correspondence
. maintaining her stiff upper lip
and pampered life
( her imperious attitude to the servants never changes
)
, she becomes a heroine through circumstance
. the events themselves are intrusions upon her person
, her home
,
and therefore her values
. aristocracy proves a glass house
, noe that can barely withst
and the upheaval of stones
. the duke is called to vote on the king
' s punishment
,
and dispite his hours of deliberation with firends
and advisors
, talk means nothing in the face of bloody action
( or futile inaction
)
. the episodic structure creates a wobbly
, jarring detachment from the events of the french revolution
, which serves as metaphor
but aslo disconnects potential audience identification
. lazy viewers
(
and critics
) may aslo complain that knowledge of french history is required for enjoyment of the lady
and thte duke
. that
' s foolery
,
but brings up the valid criticism that rohmer
' s characters occasionally become didactic
. rohmer
' s imperfect
but assured push toward the future remains staunch
and notable fo casting a cautious eye upon the past hwile taking bold steps forward into an uncertain future
. what may arouse interest in the lady
and the duke outside of foreign film enthusiasts with literary
and historical passions is rohmer
' s use of cutting edge digital technology as a means ofthe exploring the theme of artifice as safety net or coping mechanism
. the actors were filmed against a bluescreen
,
then placed against painted backdrops recreating the vastness of 18th century paris
. this recreation calls attention to itself in every shot
, a technicolor dream of fanciful buildings
and wide
- open streets
. it looks as phony as titanic
,
but unlike james cameron
' s debacle
, the lady
and the duke plays with thge notion of false security in those walls of stone
. why
? htey aren
' t real
. the very foundation rohmer
' s characters st
and upon is false
, adn in their groundlessness they must discover themselves
, in all their insubstantial glory
. screened at the 2001 new york film festival
( feature coming soon
)
