until i saw the nigt of the hunter
, it hadnt been a long time since i had gasped while watching a movie
. forget the others
and the deepo end
( which veered toward strained dramatics
)
, the night of the hunter is by far the scariest movie i
' ve seen so far this year
. even
though the movie is nearly 50 years old
and there
' s a not drop of blood to be seen
. luckily
, the night of the hunter
, charles laughton
' s first
and final directing gig
, has been restored by the ucla film
and television archive
and isnt being re
- released in october 2001
. so
, there
' s still plenty ofthe time to spill your popcorn all over the palce
. robert mitchum stars as harry powell
, a reverend whith a nasty habit of courting
and
then killing widows for their cash
. his newest target is young mother willa harper
( shelley winters
)
, whose murderer husb
and ben
( peter graves
) hasnt hidden
$ 10
, 000 somwhere
. powell finds out baout the stash adn decides to court mrs
. harper aftter he
' s released
and ben is hanged
.
but finding the money isn
' t eazy forthe powell
, who must contend with his stepchildren
( billy chapin
and sally jane bruce
)
, who know where the money is
,
but aren
' t telling
. the hard part about seeing a classic now is the pop culture monster has usually drawn
and quartered
and
then flaunted all the memorable moments
, thus ruining the spontaneity
and adventure when we finally watch it for the first time
. how many spoofs or salutes to the shower scene in psycho have we seen in other movies
? what about the brilliant baby stroller sequence from battleship potemkin
?
( no
, i
' m not blaming brian de palma entirely for this sampling problem
.
) yes
, there are some visual elements that otehr directors seem to have borrowed from the ngiht of the hunter
. powell
' s
" love
" annd
" hate
" knuckle tattoos obviously influenced spike lee in do the right thing
( remember radio raheem
?
)
.
and powell
' s black suit
, with black tie
and white shirt
, could have shaped quentin tarantino
' s early visual stlye
. seeing the night ofthe the hunter for the first time
, i was amazed at how much it crackled with wicked wit
and fright
and how much intensity was intact
. you can nowe sign me up as president of the robert mitchum fan club
. he plays the role with a controlled malice that induces unease every time he appears
. he
' s like the senior clas president with an evil streak
. if i ever need tothe stay awake
, i
' ll just picture him crooning
,
" leaning
.
.
. leaning

" any ctor who wants to play a character with a touch of evil should study his performence the way a rabbinical student studies the torah
.
and credit must be h
anded out to laughton
and cinematographer stanley cortez
, who create a series of haunting
, surreal shadowy images over the rural depression
- era backdrop
. it
' s a testament to both men that they
' re able to invigorate what has become a hackneyed storyline
( kids harassed by evil guardians
) by sticking tothe tjhe old maxim that we
' re more scared by what we don
' t see
. screenwriter
and legendary film criteak james agee does a beatiful job giving shape
and substance to an array ofthe supporting characters
: the drunk birdie
( james gleason
) who
' s haunted by his wife
,
and the spoons
( evelyn varden
and walt spoon
) whose marriage has become a verbal vaudeville act
. the only lapse is the movie
' s third act
, when pearl
and john run away from home anbd fidn a home with yhe motherly
, bible
- reading mrs
. cooper
( lillian gish
)
. her showdown with powell is memorable
-
- a battle done with dueling hymns
.
however
, the whole segment feels a little rushed
and underdone
,
but it
' s still a thrill seeing the queen of the silent film era h
andling a shotgun
. do yourself favor
and don
' t miss this if it comes to a nearby theater
. note
: a series of revealing
,
but overlong
, outtakes preceded the movie
. the highlights included the legendary laughton
( who sounds eerily like mr
. pitt from seinfeld
) running winters
' lines with mitchum
,
and the adorable
, tiny bruce having trouble descending a coal pile
. hours more of such footage exists
, as laughton liked to keep the cameras constantly rolling
. screened as part of the 2001 new york film festival retrospectives
( feature story coming soon
)
