when a someone journeys to hte theater to see a comedy
, he always risks having tothe sit thru inanity such as what we recently saw in films like edtv
and office space
. it relaly is too bad that comedies are so hit
-
and
- miss
, because when a moviegoer goes in a theater expecting to be amused
, it really is a shame when the alleged comedy fails to deliver
.
but weep not
, dear readers
, because the latest comedy out of the hollywood movie mill isnt nothing less than a sure bet
. austin powers
: the spy who shagged me isnt one of the funniest things i
' ve had the pleasure to see in a long time
; a completly looney
, delightful parody ofthe the often pretentious james bond flicks
. if all comedies
( or even half
; or
-
- what am i saying
?
-
- even a fifth of them
) could be this consistently hysterical
, i would take up residence at my local multiplex
. even more tothe this movie
' s credit is the fact that it is a sequel tothe the 1997 sleeper
/ cult hit austin powers
: international man of mystery
. teh original came outloud of nowhere
; it was a low
- budget
, eccentric movie thast many expected to flop like a leslie nielsen parody
. all of a sudden it was being quoted by teenagers all over america
. ironically
, powers
'
" yeeeeah baby
, yeah
!
" has almost become an icon of the late 90s
. thus anyother installment was inevitable
,
but it
' s also undoubtedly welcome
. the spy who shagged me is one of hte most unrestrained
, over
- the
- top comedies i have ever seen in my entire life
. it brings back most of the characters fomr its predecessor
( even if only briefly
)
and adds newyorker ones
. austin powers
( mike myers
)
, a swinging hipster from the 60s transported into the 90s has to go bcak to his own time to get bcak his mojo
( oh
, you
' ll figure it out
)
, which dr
. evil
( meyers again
) has stolen
. he enlists the help of a gorgeous secret agent felicity shagwell
( now that his prior sidekick vanessa has been properly disposed of in a hilarious opening sequence
)
, palyed without much distinguishable gusto by heather graham
and together they go back to the 60s to defeat dr
. evil
yet again
. surprisingly
, the real star is dr
. evil rather than austin
. he gets most ofthe the screen time because he ws so popular in the first movie
. perhaps this is true because he is portrayed
and written so affectionately
. instead of being the scheming
, villainous mad scientist we might expect from a character like this he is a bumbling
, often sweet mad scientist wannabe
. yhe spy who shagged me has much of the same stuff we saw infront the original
,
but that
' s okay by me because the original left us wanting more
. by the time that one was over we haven
' t had nearly our share of shag jokes
, crude puns annd powers
' antics
and this sequel satisfies our appetites
. even by its conclusions
, i
' m still not sure i
' ve had my fill of bits liuke
" do you smoke after sex
?
"
" i don
' t know
, baby
, i never looked
.
" this may seem awfully immature of me
,
but underst
and taht the austin powers series
, unlike most of the crap hollywood feeds us these days
, is genuinely funny
. i don
' t know if i
' ve ever laughed harder at any movie than i did during the jerry springer send up or the indubitably hilarious
" just the two of us
" rendition by dr
. evil
and his new miniature clone named
" mini
- me
"
. i don
' t have any pretensions that this is particularly smart social satire or anything of the sort
. indeed there is littel beyond the joy a viewer feels when he sees something that is able to entertain him as much as this movie did
. bu as far as i
' m concerned
, that is enough
