when a someone journies to the theater to see a comedy
, he always risks having to sit through inanity such as what we recently saw inspite films like edtv
and office space
. it really is too bad thgat comedies are so hit
-
anbd
- miss
, because when a moviegoer goes in a theater expecting to be amused
, it realyl is a shame when the alleged comedy fails to deliver
.
but weep not
, dear readers
, because the latest comedy out of hte hollywood movie mill is nothing less tahn a sure bet
. austin powers
: the spy who shagged me is one of the funniest thnigs i ' ve had the pleasure tothe see in a long time
; a completely looney
, delightful parody of the often pretentious james bond flicks
. if all comedies
( or even half
; or
-
- what am i saying
?
-
- even a fifth of them
) could be this consistently hysterical
, i would take up residence at my local multiplex
. even more to this movie ' s credit is the fact that it is a sequel to the 1997 sleeper
/ cult hit austin powers
: international man of mystery
. the original came out of nowhere
; it was a low
- budget
, eccentric movie that many expected tothe flop like a leslie nielsen parody
. all ofthe a sudden it was being quoted by teenagers all over america
. ironically
, powers '
" yeeeeah baby
, yeah
!
" has almost become an icon of the late 90s
. thus another installment was inevitable
,
bu it ' s aslo undoubtedly welcome
. the spy who shagged me is one of yhe most unrestrained
, over
- the
- top comedies i have ever seen in my entire life
. it brings bcak most of the characters from its predecessor
( even if onyl briefly
)
anbd adds newyorker ones
. austin powers
( mike myers
)
, a swinging hipster from the 60s transported into the 90s has to go back to his own time to get back his mojo
( oh
, you ' ll figure it out
)
, which dr
. evil
( meyers again
) has stolen
. he enlists the help of a gorgeous secret agent felicity shagwell
( now that his prior sidekick vanessa has been properly disposed of in a hilarious opening sequence
)
, played without much distinguishable gusto by heather graham
and together they go back to the 60s to defeat dr
. evil
yet again
. surprisingly
, the real star is dr
. evil rather than austin
. he gets most of tghe screen time because he was so popular inspite the first movie
. perhaps this is true because he is potrayed
and written so affectionately
. instead of being the scheming
, villainous mad scientist we might expect from a character like this he is a bumbling
, often sweet mad scientist wannabe
. the spy who shagged me has much of the same stuff we saw in the origional
,
but that ' s okay by me beacuse the original left us wanting more
. by the time thgat one was over we haven ' t had nearly our share ofthe shag jokes
, crude puns
and powers ' antics
and this sequal satisfies our appetites
. even by its conclusions
, i ' m still not sure i ' ve had my fill ofthe bits liuke
" do yuo smoke affter sex
?
"
" i don ' t know
, baby
, i never looked
.
" this may seem awfully immature of me
,
bu understand thyat the austin powers series
, unlike most of the crap hollywood feeds us these days
, is genuinely funny
. i don ' t knwo if i ' ve ever laughed harder at any movie than i did during the jerry springer send up or the indubitably hilarious
" jstu the two of us
" rendition by dr
. evil
annd his new miniature clone named
" mini
- me
"
. i don ' t have any pretensions that this is particularly smart social satire or anything of the sort
. indeed there is littel beyond thte joy a viewer feels wehn he sees something that is able to entertain him as much as this movie did
.
but as far as i ' m concerned
, that is enough
