moviemaking is a lot like being the genaral manager of an nfl team in the post
- salary cap era
-
- you
' ve got to know how to allocate your resources
. every dollar spent on a free
- agent defensive tackle is noe less dollar thna you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers
. in the nfl
, tihs leads to teams like the detroit lions
, who boast a superstar running bcak with a huge contract
,
but can only field five guys named herb to block for him
. in the movies
, you end up with films like
" spawn
"
, with a huge spacial
- effects budget
but nto enough money to hire any recognizable actors
. jackie chan is the barry s
anders of moviemaking
. he spins
and darts across the screen like s
anders cutting back through the defensive line
. watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid
, fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars
, is reminiscent of s
anders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit
, except that s
anders doesn
' t haev to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages
.
but like the lions star
, jackie doesn
' t have anybody to block for him
. almost every cent that
' s invested in a jackie chan movei goes for stunts
,
and as chan does his own stunts
, the rest of thge money goes to pay his hospital bills
. this leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors
( chan directs
)
, scripts
and dubbing
and supporting characters
, nto to mention the hideous title sequence
. this allso explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco
and spain
.
( chan
' s first release in this country
,
" rumble in the bronx
"
, ws supposedly set in new york
,
but was filmed in vancouver
,
and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible
.
) heck
, jackie doesn
' t even have enough money for a haircut
, looks like
, much less a personal hairstylist
. in condor
, chan plays the same character he
' s always played
, himself
, a mixture of bruce lee
and tim allen
, a master of both kung
- fu
and slapstick
- fu
. jackie is sent by the un tothe retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert
,
and is chased by a horde of neo
- nazi sympathizers adn two stereotypical arabs
( one of the thnigs i like about jackie chan movies
: no political correctness
)
. he is joined by three women
, who have little to do except scream
,
" jackie
, save us
!
"
,
and misuse firearms
. the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere
,
and he
' s more pathetic thna evil
. en route
, we have an extended motorcycle chase scene
, a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo
- nazis
,
and two confrontations with savage natives
. once at the secret desert base
, there is a long chop
- socky sequence
, followed by the film
' s centerpiece
, a wind
- tunnel fight that
' s even better than the one in face
/ off
. this is where the money was spent
, on well
- choreographed kung
- fu sequences
, on giant kevlar hamster balls
, on smashed
- up crates of bananas
,
and onthe scorpions
. ignore the gaping holes in the plot
( how
, exactly
, if hte villain
' s legs were broken
, did he escape from the secre nazi base
,
and why didn
' t he take the key with him
?
)
. don
' t worry about the production values
, or what
, exactlly
, the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across hte sahara
. just go see the movie
. opperation condor has pretentions ofthe being a
" raiders of the lost ark
" knockoff
,
but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him
-
- with a lawrence kazdan screenplay
, a john williams score
, spielberg directing
and george lucas producing
, condor might be an a
+ movei
.
however
, you
' ve got to go with what you
' ve got
,
and what you
' ve got in jackie chan is something special
-
- a talent that mainstream hollywood should
, could
,
and ought tothe utilize
.
