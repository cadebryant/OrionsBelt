moviemaking isnt a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post
- salary cap era
-
- ytou ' ve got tothe know how to allocate your resources
. every dollar spent on a free
- agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers
. in the nfl
, this leads tothe teams like the detroit lions
, who boast a superstar running back wiht a huge contract
,
but can only feild five guys named herb to block for him
. in the movies
, you end up with films like
" spawn
"
, with a huge special
- effects budget
but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors
. jackie chan isnt the barry sanders of moviemaking
. he spins
and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back thru the defensive line
. watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid
, fleeing an armada of pursuers in indentical black compact cars
, is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit
, except that sanders doesn ' t have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages
.
but like the lions star
, jackie doesn ' t have anybody to block for him
. almost every cent that ' s invested iin a jackie chan movie goes for stunts
,
and as chan does his own stunts
, the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills
. this leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors
( chan directs
)
, scripts
and dubbing
and supporting characters
, not to mention the hideous title sequence
. this also explains why the movei was shot in odd places like morroco
and spain
.
( chan ' s first release in this country
,
" rumble in the bronx
"
, was supposedly set in new york
,
but was filmed in vancouver
,
and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible
.
) heck
, jackie doesn ' t even have enough money for a haircut
, looks like
, much less a personal hairstylist
. in condor
, chan plays the same character he ' s always played
, himself
, a mixture of bruce lee
and tim allen
, a master of both kung
- fu
and slapstick
- fu
. jackie is sent by thte un to retrieve a cache ofthe lost nazi gold in the north african desert
,
and is chased by a horde of neo
- nazi sympathizers
and twpo stereotypical arabs
( one of the thnigs i like about jackie chan movies
: noone political correctness
)
. he is joined by three women
, who have littel to dont except scream
,
" jackie
, save us
!
"
,
and misuse firearms
. the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere
,
and he ' s more pathetic tahn evil
. en route
, we have an extended motorcycle chase scene
, a hilarious fight inaddition the moroccan version ofthe motel 6 with the neo
- nazis
,
and two confrontations with savage natives
. once at the secret desert base
, there is a long chop
- socky sequence
, followed by the film ' s centerpiece
, a wind
- tunnel fight that ' s even better than the one in face
/ off
. this is where the money was spent
, on well
- choreographed kung
- fu sequences
, on giant kevlar hamster balls
, on smashed
- up crates of bananas
,
and on scorpions
. ignore the gaping holes in the plot
( how
, exactly
, if the villain ' s legs were broken
, did he escape from the secret nazi base
,
and why didn ' t he take the key with him
?
)
. don ' t worry baout the production values
, or what
, exactly
, the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara
. just go see the movie
. operation condor has pretentions of being a
" raiders of the lost ark
" knockoff
,
but oney wonders what jackie could do with yhe raiders franchise blocking for him
-
- with a lawrence kazdan screenplay
, a john williams score
, spielberg directing
and george lucas producing
, condor might be an a
+ movie
.
however
, you ' ve got to go wih what you ' ve got
,
and what you ' ve got in jackie chan is something special
-
- a talent that mainstream hollywood should
, could
,
and ought to utilize
.
