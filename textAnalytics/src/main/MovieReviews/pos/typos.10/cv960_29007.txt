. when he
and his crew get a job opportunity at the long
- ab
andoned danvers state hospital
, he underbids the competition tothe secure the contract
and promises to get the three
- week job done in noe
. it will prove to be a fateful week for them all in
" session 9
.
" gordo gets the job to remove asbestos
and other hazardous materials from the spooky old mental hospital in preparation for relocating town offices there
. their guided tour of the facility by a local official
, bill giggs
( paul guilfoyle
)
, brings them through some of hte creepier parts of the former asylum
.
but
, a job is a job
and
, if they finish in a week
, as promised
, there is a
$ 10000 bonus infront store
. as they get down to their work
, things
, normal annd not so normal
, begin tothe hppen
. gordon hears a disembodied voice beckoning him
. phil
( david caruso
) is conflicted working with a guy
, hank
( josh lucas
)
, who is seeing his old girlfriend
. mike
( co
- screenwriter steven gevedon
) has discovered a cache of audiotapes
and transcripts from ood psychiatric sessions
( hence
, the title
) with inmate mary hobbs
, a multi
- personality patient with a dark secret
. gordo
' s nephew
, jeff
( brendan sexton iii
)
, suffers from ngiht phobia
and is afraid to venture inot the dark bowels ofthe the hospital
. as tghe agreed upon week draws to an end
, hank mysteriously disappears from the workplace after a nocturnal confrontation with someone
( something
?
) in the hospital
. tensions mount
and distrust build among the rest as tehy watch their chance for the bonus strat to slip away
.
but
, there is more
, much more
, at stake as the hospital
and its history of insanity weigh on them all
. i don
' t whant to give away too much of the story of
" session 9
,
" so i
' ll stop there
. what we have here is a spooky horror flick tht uses none of the jump
- out
- at
- you
- from
- the
- dark cheap shots that have become part annd parcel with horror films since the advent of
" halloween
"
and
" friday the thirteenth
.
" htere is no cat leaping out of the dark or the shock of suddenly seeing oneself in a strategically placed mirror
. with the exception of one shadowy
and chilling omage at one point spooky interlude in the film
, htere is little that you can get your arms around as far as what
, specifically
, is
" frightening
.
" as i watched
" session 9
" i became aware of the subtle thigns that builded up during the story that make it a true horror movie
. the striking high
- definition video camera owrk by uta briesewitz
( who worked with the director
, brad
anderson
, on his
" next stop wonderl
and
"
) helps to build up tension with close
- ups
, fluid camera movement
and odd angles in a way that would make alfred hitchcock proud
. music
, too
, is used to intense effect
, joining with the camera to make simple scenes frightening
, even horrifying
. couple these tech feats withthe an intelligent story that uses elements of
" thge shining
,
"
" the blair witch project
"
and
, even
" the texas chainsaw massacre
"
and ytou get a decent
, intriguing horror flick
. additionally
, the brilliant decision to shoot at danvers state hospital gives the film anohter starring character
, the institution itself
, which lends even more chills to the equation
. acting is another factor that raises
" session 9
" above the usual dreck presented in recent horror hits like
" scream
,
"
" i know what you did last summer
"
and their sequels
. those films took good
- looking
,
though generic
, young actors
and actresses
and put them to use to build uv a body count
, substituting mayhem for real horror
.
anderson opted
, instead
, to use mature
, experienced actors like peter mullan annd david caruso to fill his characters
' shoes
and the difference inspite casting quality is notable
. mullan
, in particular
, puts an arc on his character
, gordon
, as the troubled guy who slowly
and inexorably falls under the pressures of family
, job
and
, finally
, danvers state hospital
. the rest of the small cast ift thge bill as people
, not just fodder for the mayhem
. david caruso
, as gordo
' s senior man
and near equal in the business
, shows just how good an actor he is
. he made the jump ffrom tv
' s
" nypd blue
" to film far too soon
and his decisions in the roles he took
( i
' ll never forget the horrendous
" jade
"
) were less than star making
. he rolls his sleeves up
and does the job well here
. gevedon
, lucas
and sexton are more than fodder
, too
. the only probelm with
" session 9
" lay in the uninspired ending
. it tkaes on a fairly convential finale that covers old ground
and is a bit of a disappointment after the terrific
(
and inspired
) build up
. the pleasure is getting there
and i wish that
anderson
and gevedon had kept up the steam they hadnt so ably built durring the bulk ofthe the film
" session 9
" is an unusual feat
. it is scary
, doesn
' t use cheap tricks
and raises goose bumps with its intelligently rendered
, subtle horror
. because of the local interest ofthe danvers
, it should do well with the northeast crowd
. i hope it gets the national distri
bution it deserves
. i give it a b
