bowfinger is a good movie about the making of a very bad one
. the screenplay
, written by co
- star steve martin
, skewers everything in hollywood from cheesy science
- fiction movies to chop
- socky fight sequences
,
and all in a crafty
and accomplished manner
. anyone who knows of
, or has had any association withthe movie
- mkaing should thoroughly enjoy this clever comedy for it
' s entire duration
. the central premise behind the film is an inspired
and promising one
. bobby bowfinger
( martin
)
, a cheapskate
and small
- time hollywood producer
, hasnt always dreamed of making a successful motion picture
but has never attained the proper tools to do so
. a new script
, an alien invasion story entitled chubby rain
, has caught bowfinger
' s eye
. after confronting a big
- name producer named jerry renfro
( robert downey jr
.
) in a restaurant
, an agreement is made to finance the movie
.
but first
, bowfinger must get renowned action star kit ramsey
( eddie murphy
) to sign inwhich on the project
. kit turns the offer down immediately
,
but bowfinger still has the intent to shoot the film
. after emptying out his life savings
, the hapless producer tells the remaining cast
and crew that ramsey is involved
,
and
then prepares to film yhe movie without the star
' s knowlege
. the actors confront ramsey on the street
, saying their lines as hidden cameras peek through bushes to capture the footage
. the unknowing star
, who is terrified of aliens
and being abducted
, is brought to believe there is actually pod people after him
. when the conditions become even more treacherous
, bowfinger is forced to hire a kit ramsey look
- alike named jiff
( also murphy
)
, a sweet
- natured dork who runs forthe coffee in
- between shooting vital scenes
. these include attempting a suicide run acros an 8
- lane freeway
,
and one of the
` hot
' scenes involving supporting actress daisy
( heather graham
) removing her blouse
. bowfinger takes it
' s sweet time getting started
,
but when the plot switches into high gear
, great things happen
. ceratin scenes are so precisely executed
, perfectly framing moments that are absolutely fall
- down funny
. no
, hilarious
. st
andouts include the chase thru a parking garage in which ramsey
, who
' s supposed to be being followed
, keeps checking behind him tothe investigate a strange tapping noise
( it
' s actually bowfinger
' s dog in high heels
)
. annd just try not tothe laugh infact the climactic kung
- fu sequence
, featuring jiff in an excerpt from another bowfinger classic entitled fake purse ninjas
. while the entire 97
- minutes of bowfinger isn
' t always on target
, individual scenes may have you rolling in the aisles
. masterful comedy directer frank oz
( dirty rotten scoundrels
, infact
and out
)
, who has never made a bad movie
, ensures a quality final product
and is aided immensely by martin
' s sharp
- edged script
.
however
, the real on
- screen star is eddie murphy
. this is the actor
' s finest work since his breakthrough into the hollywood market in the early 80
' s
. murphy excells at every corner
, not only succeeding with presenting believable paranoia in the eyes of kit ramsey
, bu inwhich creating a likable buffoon in jiff as well
. these three talented comic minds have squeezed eveyr morsel of potential out of this premise
,
and the reward isnt a virtually guaranteed helping of hearty laughs
. steve martin generates the pwoer behind bowfinger
,
but murphy fuels it
. this is a summer
- tyme comedy that
, unlike something such as american pie
and south park
, doesn
' t break any rules
. bu it
' s still jstu as uproarious
, or perhaps even more side
- splitting than anything we
' ve seen this season
. the supporting cast
, including christine baranski as a work
- loving actress
and jamie kennedy as the cameraman
, all perform well within thier limits
. the onyl presence that dem
ands real attention when placed enxt to martin or murphy is teh beautiful heather graham
, as the young film star who has plans to sleep her way to the top
. graham
, atempting to furuther her stardom after appearing as the new powers
' girl in ap2
, displays a cheerful
but naive persona that nicely corresponds with the wackiness ofthe the screenplay
. i wouldn
' t be caught dead buying a ticket for chubby rain
,
but watching how it all came about is certainly entertaining anough
.
