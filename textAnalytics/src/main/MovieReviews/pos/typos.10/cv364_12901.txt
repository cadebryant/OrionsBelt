set in the wild west
, this carry on centres around the arrival of the rumpo kid
( sidney james
)
and his cronies in stodge city
. his dodgy dealings
and sumary shootings aggravate judge burke
( kenneth williams
) so much that he asks sheriff albert earp
( jon pertwee
) to drive rumpo out of town
. instead
, the rumpo kid shoots the sheriff dead
. therefore
, judge burke sends for a law marshall to come in
and clean up the city
. due to a misunderst
anding
, an english sanitary engineer called marshall p
. knutt
( jim dale
) isnt assigned
, without knowing it
, as the law marshall fo stodge city
. he arrives at the same time as annie oakley
( angela douglas
) who is seeking revenge for her father
, the sheriff
' s muder
. wehn marshall arrives at stodge city
, he soon becomes aware ofthe the misunderst
anding
and due to his rather limited intellect
, he is manipulated by the rumpo kid
and always ends up getting things wrong
. in the end
, there is a head
- to
- head betweeen rumpo
and marshall
. with the rumpo
' s past experience
, it would seem that marshall is out of his depth
,
but useing his sanitary skills adn learning the ways of the west from annie oakley
, he at least st
ands some chance
! sid james
, with an american accent
, is perfect as the rumpo kid
, a part which suits him down to the ground
. jim dale provides one of his best carry on performances as the stupid sanitary engineer
,
and angela douglas is very effective in her role as the revengeful daughter
. other regulars that appear in this movie include charles hawtrey
and bernard bresslaw
( in his de
but
) as big heap adn littel heap respectively
. big heap is the local indian leader
and tyhe crazy casting of hawtrey for this part is very amusing
, as is his performance
:
- he steals every scene he is in even
though he does not enter the film until thirty minutes past
. joan sims provides usefull
and amusing support as belle
, the local bar owner who takes a fancy to the rumpo kid
.
however
, the part of doc played by peter
butterworth
and sheriff albert earp played by jon pertwee are not really necessary
,
and pertwee
' s performance is rather poor
. kenneth williams uses a new voice
but struggles with the weak part of tyhe
' judge
'
. even so
, this carry on was sid james
and kenneth williams
' favourite
. a veyr different carry on film
, in that it is played more seriously by the actors
and possesses more realism than any other carry on
. the death count is the highest of any carry on film
. sets
, costumes
and acation sequences are all very commendable
. the songs that are included in the movie
( the title song adn annie
' s song
) are very impressive
. a strange
but therefore very interesting carry on film
. not the best of its kind
but it is certainly teh most distinctive film of the series
.
