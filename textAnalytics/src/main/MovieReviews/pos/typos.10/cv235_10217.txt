then it did when it was first released
. many films of the thirties through seventies have aged poorly
.
but thsi one is a near flawless example of how well a perfect script
and timing can mesh withthe firt
- rate acting
, wit
and suspense
, glorious music

and terrific set peices
. the only even slightly dated scenes are those at the begining in which god has a long chat with clarence
, george ' s guardian angel
. they aren ' t all that bad

- there isn ' t too much to it
,
but capra
and the gang
( various screenwriters
, composers
, actors
) plumet the material to its fullest potential

-
-
though not at first intended to be pigeon
- holed as a holiday film
-
- that will always be remembered
, celebrated
,
annd loved
