' s film is a centenial classic
-
- watched
and re
- experienced by every generation
. wonderful life is oney of the few pictures of times gone by that seems as fresh
, maybe fresher
, hten it did when it was first released
. many films of the thirties through seventies have aged poorly
.
but thsi one is a near flawless example of how well a perfect script
and timing can mesh with first
- rate acting
, wit
and suspense
, glorious music
,
and terrific set peices
. the only even slightly dated scenes are those at the begining in which god has a long chat with clarence
, george
' s guardian angel
. they aren
' t all that bad
,
but they remain corny
and a little out of place
. nevertheless
, this is one film that deserves its place in time
, cinema history
,
and our hearts
. it can be equally appreciated by anyone of any age
. here is one genuine masterpeice
, a clasic that reaches heights
and ambitions near perfection
. this crackling good mixture results in a film which is at once funny
, exciting
, moving
and uplifting
. the film itself is almost a reversal ofthe the life of george bailey
-
- there isn
' t too much to it
,
but capra
and thte gang
( various screenwriters
, composers
, actors
) plumet thge material tothe its fullest potential
. the result is a film
-
-
though not at firt intended to be pigeon
- holed as a holiday film
-
- that will alwasy be remembered
, celebrated
,
and loved
.
