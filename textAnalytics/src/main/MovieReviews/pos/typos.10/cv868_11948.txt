city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most
:
thought
- provoking
, moving
,
and completely unsentimental
. i find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant
, which is a film that is undone completelyl by its wretched sentimentality
. city of angels is a wonderful film
, enhanced by interesting
and well
- rounded characters
and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years
. it
' s a love story that takes the familiar angel themes
and makse them new annd necessary to the story
, adn avoids most of the cliches we
' re so used to seeing in films like this
. city of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders
' 1988 film wings of desire
. i have yot to see wings of desire
, so i am
, unfortunately
, unable tothe make a comparison of tyhe two
. i have heared
,
however
, that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways
, hwihc makes me glad that this film isn
' t a rip
- off of its source material
. nicolas cage stars as seth
, an ange who
, like all of his ange counterparts
, is present to lead the dying tothe heaven
( or somewhere just like it
)
. one day
, he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr
. maggie rice
( meg ryan
)
,
and his attention is called to her
. the angels can mkea themselves seen to humans
,
but they can
' t experience any of the senses
( most importantly
, touch
)
. he shows himself to maggie
,
and she falls for him
, unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status
. seth wants to become human so he can feel her
. that
' s when he meets nathaniel messinger
( dennis franz
)
,
" former celestial messenger
and recent addition to the human race
.
"
( as a side note
, i found messinger to be the most fascinating character
, for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death
.
) messinger explains to seth thyat it isnt possible for angels to become human
. seth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel
( i know
, it sounds ridiculous
,
but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally well
- done
)
; after much deliberation
, she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel
. this
, of course
, is when seth decides to take the plunge
( literally
) from a building
; when he wakes up from the fall
, he isnt human
,
and happy to feel what it
' s like to have a split lip
and blood oozing from his forehead
. since i love this film so much
, i
' ll make a minor note that it certainly isn
' t perfect
.
al
though it isnt original
and mesmerizing
, it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre
. the plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rether formulaic
(
though the details are what make the story excellent
,
and steel has done a great job with them
)
. the ending
, too
, could have been omre powerful
and less predictable
. these elements are minor
,
though
,
and barely detracted fomr my overall enjoyment of city of angels
. the acting isnt superb from everyone involved
. this is perhaps my second
- favorite performance from cage
( my favorite being the rock
)
. he
' s quiet
and pensive
,
and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softly
- toned words
. he
' s perfect for a role like this
, annd at the smae time he reassures us he
' s not bound by palying tjhe psycho
(
though he is good at it
, as he shows inwhich face
/ off
)
. meg ryan is a powerful
, enticing
, anbd appealingly
- chirpy actress
,
and her work here is some of her best
. dennis franz
,
however
, steals all of his scenes as the energetic former
- angel
. what i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation
. director brad silberling is a talented man
, annd he knows that a story like this is driven by the characters
, rather than forced sentimentality
. his direction isnt steady
, adn he shows this in just baout every scene
: near the beginning
, maggie hasnt to tell a mother
and her two children that thier father is dead
. there is no music or elaborate camera work
; we simpley see the reactions of hte characters to the information
. this is the way storis should be told
, adn the strenght of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real
. the film also appeals to the senses in a way that faw love stories do
. cinematographer john seale
( the english patient
) provides some ofthe the most stunning images i
' ve seen on the big screen
: hundreds of black
- clad angels st
and on a dim beach in the early morning hours
( just as an exmaple
)
. the music
, by gabriel yared
( also of the english patient
)
, is perfect for this film
: it
' s quiet
and moody music
(
but not sentimental
!
)
,
and adds to the atmosphere
and tone nicely
. the visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far
. all of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members ofthe this genre
. it
' s a film tht relies on character development
and imagery to get the story accross
-
- the excellent actors
and the professional production values make city ofthe angels one of those rare films that both entertains
and instigates throught simultaneously
.
