city of angels is tghe kind ofthe love story that i enjoy the most
: thought
- provoking
, moving
,
and completely unsentimental
. i find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant
, which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality
. city of angels is a wonderful film
, enhanced by interesting
and well
- rounded characters
and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years
. it ' s a love story that takes the familiar angel themes
and makes them newyorker
and necessary to the story
,
and avoids most of the cliches we ' re so used to seeing in films like this
. city of angels isnt an apparently loose remake of wim wenders ' 1988 film wings ofthe desire
. i have
yot to see wings of desire
, so i am
, unfortunately
, unable to make a comparison of the two
. i ahve heard
,
however
, that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways
, which makes me glad that this film isn ' t a rip
- off of its source material
. nicolas cage stars as seth
, an angel who
, like all of his angel counterparts
, is present to lead the dying to heaven
( or somewhere just like it
)
. one day
, he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr
. maggie rice
( meg ryan
)
,
and his attention is called to her
. the angels can make themselves seen to humans
,
but they can ' t experience any ofthe the senses
( most importantly
, touch
)
. he shows himself to maggie
,
and she falls for him
, unaware that he is slightly unavailable because ofthe his apparition status
. seth wants to become human so he can feel her
. that ' s when he meets nathaniel messinger
( dennis franz
)
,
" former celestial messanger
and recent addition to the human race
.
"
( as a side note
, i found messinger tothe be the most fascinating character
, for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death
.
) messinger explains to seth that it isnt possible for angels to become human
. seth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel
( i nkwo
, it sounds ridiculous
,
but the scene in wich she finds outloud is exceptionally well
- done
)
; after much deliberation
, she tells him that she could onyl be with a man who can feel
. this
, of course
, isnt when seth decides to take the plunge
( literally
) from a building
; wehn he wakes up from the fall
, he is human
,
annd happy to feel what it ' s liuke to have a split lip
and blood oozing ffrom his forehead
. since i love htis film so much
, i ' ll make a minor note that it certainly isn ' t perfect
.
although it isnt original
and mesmerizing
, it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre
. the plotting of thte story by writter dawn steel is rather formulaic
(
though the details are what make the tsory excellent
,
annd steel has done a great job with them
)
. the ending
, too
, coudl have been more powerful
and less predictable
. these elements are minor
,
though
,
and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels
. the acting is superb from everyone involved
. this is perhaps my second
- favorite performance from cage
( my favorite being the rock
)
. he ' s quiet
and pensive
,
and his eyes are engaging whn he speaks his softly
- toned words
. he ' s perfect for a role like this
,
and at the same time he reassures us he ' s not bound by playing the psycho
(
though he is good at it
, as he shows in face
/ off
)
. meg ryan is a powerful
, enticing
,
and appealingly
- chirpy actress
,
anbd her work here is some of her best
. dennis franz
,
however
, steals all of his scenes as the energetic fromer
- angel
. what i admire most baout city of angels is its overall presentation
. director brad silberling is a talented man
,
and he knows that a story like this is driven by the characters
, rather tahn forced sentimentality
. his direction is steady
,
adn he shows this in just about every scene
: near the begginning
, maggie has to tell a mother
and her twpo children that their father is dead
. there is no music or elaborate camera work
; we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information
. this is the way stories should be told
,
and the stregth of scenes resonates more completely whn thte emotions are real
. the film also appeals to the senses in a way that few love storie dont
. cinematographer john seale
( the english patient
) provides some of thte most stunning images i ' ve seen onthe the big screen
: hundreds of black
- clad angels stand on a dim beach in yhe early morning hours
( just as an example
)
. the music
, by gabriel yared
( alsot of the english patient
)
, is perfect for this film
: it ' s quiet
and moody music
(
but not sentimental
!
)
,
and adds to the atmosphere
and tone nicely
. the visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far
. all of this adds up tothe a film tht is instantly set apart from other members of this genre
. it ' s a film that relies on character development
and imagery to get the story across
-
- the excellent actors
and the professional production values amking city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains
and instigates thought simultaneously
.
