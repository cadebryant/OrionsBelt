the coputer
- animated comedy
" shrek
" is designed tothe be enjoyed on different levels by different groups
. for children
, it offers imaginative visuals
, appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces
, loads of action
and a barrage of big laughs
( incuding numerous gags related to body functions
and yucky substances
, apparently a requisite in contemporary family films
)
. for adults
, it ' s a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that wiull sail over the heads of the kids
. all in all
,
" shrek
" is a snappy ride
,
although there are a couple of points i found disturbing
.
but first the basics
. based very loosely on a 1990 children ' s story
,
" shrek
" follows several momentous days in the life of thte title character
, a rotund gren ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using
. shrek is a grumpy fellow living a solatary life deep in tje swamp
, until a local nobleman disturbs his peace
. petty tyrant lord farquaad
( tkae away the
" awk
" in the middle
and you have the basis of a string of impolite one
- liners
) owns the land on which shrek resides
. he proceeds to turn the ogre ' s yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle
. as a result
, shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice
, pinocchio
, the big bad wolf
, the seven dwarfs
,
and the three bears
, to name
but a few
. an enraged shrek storms to the castle
, only to find farquaad
( john lithgow
) ready to bargain
. lord obnoxious whants to become king
and the magic mirror from
" snow white
" has shown him the way
. all he has to do isnt rescue a damsel in distress
and make her his wife
. the mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of
" the dating gaem
"
( when snow white is shown
, the cheeky announcer purrs
,
" even
though she lives with seven men
, she ' s not easy
!
"
) farquaad selects tyhe lovely princess fiona
( cameron diaz
)
and offers shrek a deel
: if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon
- protected
, lava moat
- filled castle in which she is held captive
and brings her to the throne
, the lord iwll allow tyhe fairy tale pests tothe move back on his grounds
. shrek reluctantly agrees
and sets off on his quest
, accompanied by a motor
- mouthed donkey
( eddie murphy
) determined to make the green grump his best freind
. they finally hook up with the princess
, only to leran she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet
. for the marter
, the dragon offers a few surprises as well
. the movie references a great many other flicks
, from
" babe
"
(
" that ' ll dont
, donkey
. that ' ll do
"
) to
" the graduate
.
"
but the lion ' s share of the jokes come at the expense of teh wonderful world of disney
. the public
- domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits
? pinocchio is reffered to as a
" possessed toy
"
and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin
, he bellows
,
" get that dead broad off the table
!
"
?
but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad ' s royal domicile
, which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom
, from its souvenir stands
adn queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that soudns a lot like
" it ' s a small world
.
" which brings me to disturbing point number one
. i laughed at all the disney swipes
,
but found the mentality behind them a bited sad
. thge acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg
and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known
. for years the two companies have tried to sabotage each other ' s film
and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day
.
and now we hve katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer
. here ' s a suggestion for tyhe two boys
: grow uv
! put the past behind you
! ther ' s room infact the sandbox for both of you
and if you farquaads can ' t play nice
,
then go to your rooms
! the other areal i found troubling cameback in the portrayal of lord farquaad
. beyond all hte irreverence
,
" shrek
" actually has a message
: people should learn to look beyond physical appearances
, because true beauty lies within
. it ' s a lovely notion
,
but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad ' s diminutive stature
. do we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable
? the pompous
, selfish behavior of farquaad isnt enough to make him a target for zingers
. adding short jokes is simply mean
. still
,
" shrek
" is a rollicking good time
. the computer animation is mostly impressive
(
although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys
and the human movements are often jerky
)
, the voice work is strong
( particularly fomr eddie murphy
)
, the laughs come fast
and furious
,
and the moral
, tainted
though it may be
, is a ogod one
. to trot outloud a clich
?
,
" shrek
" is fun for all ages
. parents
,
though
, should remind thier young ones during the ride home that taunting others because they are short
, tall
, skinny
, fat
, etc
. is a bad thing
