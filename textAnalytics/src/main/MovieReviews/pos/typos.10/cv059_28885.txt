the computer
- animated comedy
" shrek
" is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by diffrent groups
. fo children
, it offers imaginative visuals
, appealling new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces
, loads of action
and a barrage of big laughs
( inlcuding numerous gags realted to body functions
and yucky substances
, apparently a requisite in contempory famaly films
)
. fo adults
, it
' s a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids
. all in all
,
" shrek
" is a snappy ride
,
al
though there are a couple of points i found disturbing
.
but first the basics
. based very loosely on a 1990 children
' s story
,
" shrek
" follows several momentous days in the life of the title character
, a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using
. shrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp
, until a local nobleman disturbs his peace
. petty tyrant lord farquaad
( take away the
" awk
" in the middle
and you have the basis of a string of impolite one
- liners
) owns the l
and on which shrek resides
. he proceeds to turn the ogre
' s yard into an ellis isl
and for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle
. as a result
, shrek finds himself surrounded by legends liek the three blind mice
, pinocchio
, the big bad wolf
, the seven dwarfs
,
and the three bears
, to name
but a few
. an enraged shrek storms to the castle
, only to find farquaad
( john lithgow
) ready to bargain
. lord obnoxious wants tothe become king
and the magic mirror from
" snow white
" has shown him tje way
. all he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress
and make her his wife
. the mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of
" the dating game
"
( when snow white is shown
, the cheeky announcer purrs
,
" even
though she lives with seven men
, she
' s not easy
!
"
) farquaad selects the lovely princess fiona
( cameron diaz
)
and offers shrek a deal
: if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon
- protected
, lava moat
- filled castle inwhich which she is held captive
and brings her to the throne
, tghe lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds
. shrek reluctantly agrees
and sets off on his quest
, accompanied by a motor
- mouthed donkey
( eddie murphy
) determined to make the green grump his best friend
. htey finally hook up with the princess
, only tothe learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet
. for the matter
, the dragon offers a few surprises as well
. the movei references a great many other flicks
, from
" babe
"
(
" that
' ll do
, donkey
. that
' ll do
"
) to
" the graduate
.
"
but the lion
' s share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney
. the public
- domain characters made into icons iin various disney films take their hits
? pinocchio is referred to as a
" possessed toy
"
and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white inaddition his cabin
, he bellows
,
" git that dead broad off the table
!
"
? bu the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad
' s royal domicile
, which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom
, from its souvenir st
ands
and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like
" it
' s a small world
.
" which brings me to disturbing point number one
. i laughed at all the disney swipes
,
but found tjhe mentality behind them a bit sad
. the acrimony betwen dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg annd disney big wheel michael eisner is well known
. for years the two companies have tryed to sabotage each otehr
' s film
and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the smae day
. annd now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer
. here
' s a suggestion for the two boys
: grow up
! put the past behind you
! htere
' s room inaddition the s
andbox for both of you
and if you farquaads can
' t play nice
,
then go to your rooms
! the other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad
. beyond all the irreverence
,
" shrek
" actually has a message
: people should leran to look beyond physical appearances
, because true beauty lies within
. it
' s a lovely notion
,
but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad
' s diminutive stature
. do we really need a famaly film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable
? the pompous
, selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers
. adding short jokes is simply mean
. still
,
" shrek
" is a rollicking ogod tyme
. the computer animation is mostly impressive
(
al
though several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys annd the human movements are often jerky
)
, the voice work is strong
( particularly from eddie murphy
)
, the laughs come fast anbd furious
,
and the moral
, tainted
though it may be
, is a ogod one
. tothe trot out a clich
?
,
" shrek
" is fun for all ages
. parents
,
though
, should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others beacuse htey are short
, tall
, skinny
, fat
, etc
. is a bad thing
.
