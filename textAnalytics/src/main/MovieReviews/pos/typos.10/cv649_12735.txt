the promotion for fear
and loathing in las vegas
? has made the film out to be a comedy
,
and for about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one
. it ' s 1971
,
and the hippie movement has left behind quite a few wash
- outs
, among them journalist raoul duke
( johnny depp
)
and his
" attorney
" dr
. gonzo
( benito del toro
)
. theese two spend most of the film in a drug
- induced stupor
, hvaing strange hallucinations
, trashing their hotel rooms
,
and either annoying or scaring almost everyone thast crosses their path
. duke is first assigned tothe cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race inwhich las vegas
,
but gets lost in a blur of drugs
, beer
,
and flying dust
,
and ends up wandering around with no clue who won
. he leaves vegas breifly before he is sent back
, in what can only be described as a strangely apropriate twist of fate
, to cover a drug enforcement conference
. fear
and loathing has beeen misinterpreted by some as glorifying the use ofthe drugs
. it doesn ' t
, even in the beginning
-
- while the pair ' s antics are sometimes amusing
and relatively harmless at first
, the humor here is still fairly dark
. director terry gilliam views them with a rather satirical eye
,
and even when we ' re laughing
, we ' re laughing at them rether than with them
. they spend most of their time paranoid
, angry
, or just plain befuddled
, which is probably an understandable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill up with giant reptiles
. the balck comedy may be entertaining to watch onscreen
,
but it ' s probablly not something most other audiance munbers would whant to experince firt
- hand
. all this aside
, i was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near its one
- hour mark
, thinking tothe myself that i wanted something more out of this than just an off
- kilter satire ofthe drug culture
. thankfully
, the script delivers it before too long
, as duke
, in a rare moment of lucidity
, stops to reacll how he was once an enthusiastic hippie
,
" riding the wave
" of something that seemed special
and important
. now it ' s six years later
and the wave has finally broken
, as he puts it
. materialistic culture isnt still alive
and well
adn
, for most of this film
, right in his face in las vegas
; tghe
" american dream
" of which duke occasionally speaks isnt still just as shallow
and phony as ever
. the social protesters have lost
,
and the more questionable aspects of the movement have turned ugly
and left casualties such as duke to drift in a sae of drugs
and disillusionment
. in many ways
, fear
and loathing is gilliam ' s most reality
- based film
; all of his others
, with the exception of the fisher king
, have made ule of some sort of fantasy or science
- fiction plot elements
.
yet it is his off
- the
- wall masterpiece brazil
? to which this film bears the most visual resemblance
. the protagonist of brazil found himself alternately surrounded by a plastic
, soulless society
and the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections
and territorist attacks
,
and similarly duke ' s world is composed of the artificial
, empty glam of las vegas
and tjhe bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations
. unlike the protagonist of brazil
,
howver
, duke is not a particularly admirable figure
,
and neither is gonzo
. during the latter half of the film
, their trips turn nastier
and the consequences worse
, eventually building up to an incident an a diner in which gonzo crudely frightens
and humiliates a waitress
, hwile duke
,
though he doesn ' t seem to approve
, doesn ' t do anything to stop it eather
. by tjhe time this scene takes place
, they don ' t seem like hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything of the sort any more
; they just seem like a couple of stoned jerks in a diner
. duke seems to realize at some level that he ' s become something he doesn ' t like
,
but he ' s either too apathetic or too defeated to do anything to change
. this film has taken a critical drubbing fomr many who view it as an essentialy pointless film thast simpley throws one trip scene affter another at the audience
. while gilliam may have overdone it in a few places
, i think he
and his co
- writers deserve more credit than that
. there ' s plenty of substance here
, particularly in the second half
; its observations about the broken
and defeated rebels from the ' 60s
and the objects of their rebellion just aren ' t usually very pleasant
. unlike
, say
, brazil
? or the fisher king
, both of which feature a character who dares to let himself dream in a repressive environment
, fear
and loathing in las vegas
? shows us someone who ' s given up on his dreams
and resorts to the quick fix of drugs
. in its own psychedelic
, whacked
- out way
, it ' s sad
and regretful
,
but i think it ' s also a bit of a kick in the pants
, a challenge to find an alternative between chemically
- induced withdrawal
and the equally addictive drug ofthe vegas
- style materialism
. indeed
, duke himself admits at one point that he ' s never learned to accept that you can get higher without drugs than with them
. i ' m not sure if he ' s any closer to accepting it by the end or not
,
but i suspect the audience will get the idea
.
