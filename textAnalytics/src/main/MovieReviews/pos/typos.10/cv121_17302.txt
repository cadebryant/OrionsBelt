i relish those rare opportunities whn a talented screenwrighter can make me feel like a fool
. i spended the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marrige
, grousing to myself about its transparently planes
, trains
and automobiles plot machinations
,
and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement
. this was a mass market romantic comedy
, aftter all
, a genre which has been taken over by teenagers
and
, even in its best days
, worked hard to perpetuate the romance
= infatuation paradigm
.
then marc lawrence did something wonderful
, something which made the entire film click inot place
: he showed me a comic love story about grown
- ups
. it certainly didn
' t look that way from the outset
, hwihc introduces groom
- to
- be ben holmes
( ben affleck
) at his bachelor party
, surrounded by friends
and family whooping over his
" last night of freedom
.
" ben loves his fiancee bridget
( maura tierney
)
,
but thge doom
- adn
- gloom pronouncements of everyone around him have him questioning the meaning of this
' till death do you part business
. thn
, on an ill
- fated flight from new york to his wedding in savannah
, ben meets sarah lewis
( s
andra bullock
)
, a free
- spirited woman with a string of failed careers
and relationships behind her
. as transportation troubles thwart them at every turn
, ben
and sarah begin a three
- day southward journey in whihc their connection grows ever stronger
, ben seeing in sarah the chances he
' s never taken
and sarah seeing in ben the stability she
' s never had
. forces of nature gets off to a solid enough start
, setting up the characters
and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue
. ben is an ideal role for affleck
' s easy
- going charm
,
and he plays the straight
- laced straight man without forced exasperation
. s
andra bullock
, for her part
, is more loose annd appealing than she has been in her last half
- dozen films combined
, avoiding her recent habit ofthe playing any semblance of character depth as moping
. the two performances
-
- part of a great top
- to
- bottom cast
-
- are effective
and conected from thge start
,
yet the script
' s apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completly
. lively
and funny
though it may be on a consistent basis
, forces ofthe nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like self
- justification
. the kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactlly the opposite purpose
, leading to a suprisingly emotional resolution
. forces of nature isn
' t about a man developing a fear of commitment
; it
' s about a man learning what commitment means
_ to him
_
, learning that it
' s not what he
thought it was
. lawrence
' s script feints anbd dodges before reaching its happy endig
, an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense
. earlier scenes that might have feeled like throwaways take on more resonance
,
and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh
and genuin
.
though one too many plot contrivances keep ben
and sarah together through the film
,
and htey do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples
, forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that you
' ll end up remembering the humor
and the simple wisdom
. that is
, provided you
' re not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes
. for a brisk romantic comedy
, forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most over
- directed scenes of the year
: teetering h
and
- held shots
, why
- not low or high angles
, sweeping pans
. occasionally the hyper
- rela approach works
, with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance
; far more often
, hughes refuses to let a scene be what it is
, covering it with flourishes so thick you almost can
' t find what
' s underneath
. a script this smart
and mature deserved a more restrained director
,
but even hughes
' excesses can
' t spoil this unique concoction
. forces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something whith the power tothe enchant
, something that can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for
and about adolescents
.
