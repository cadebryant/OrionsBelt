the rocky horror picture sohw
' special edition
'
( 1975
) starring
: tim curry
and susan sar
andon cult films are never mainstream
. the casual viewer of a cult film will look at it
and be repulsed
and confused
, yelling out
' what the hell is that
?
'
. fans of these sorts of movies will be laughing at every other second at all the
' hidden jokes
' they missed the first time around while normal movie watchers will look at them like they
' re insane
. the rocky horror picture show
, recently re
- released inspite a
' special edition
' tothe video
, is the mother of all cult films
. period
. like some other cult films
, most notably little shop of horrors
, the rocky horror picture sohw is a musical with a twisted edge tothe it
. this movie beggins out innocently enough
- a couple get engaged at a friend
' s wedding
and git a flat tire in the middle of the night while it
' s raining
. they go to a castle to try tothe use the phone
. little do they know that the castle is owned by dr
. frank n
. furter
, a mad transexual transvestite scientist who has recently created a creature he wiull use for personal reasons
. the acting is pretty good overall
. tim curry
( hmeo alone 2
, legend
) isnt over
- the
- top as frank n
. furter
. it
' s interesting to see that this movie ws noe of future oscar winner susan sar
andon
' s
( dead man walking
) first film
- she plays janet
, the girlfriend of brad majors
. even the singer meatloaf is in it
!
! the songs are all very good yot twisted in their own way
. a sampling of titles range from damn it
, janet to touch
- a touch
- a touch
- a touch me
. all the actors sing their songs with no dubbing from other actors
- kind ofthe a bad thing
. barry bostwick
( brad majors
) tries to sing as does susan sar
andon
,
but tim curry is claerly tjhe most proffesional having exstensive stage experience
. meatloaf sings like meatloaf
. the new special edition contains two original movie trailers of the film as well as two songs deleted from the original version
. sadly
, the songs are tacked after thte credits
- kind of defeats the purpose
. if you want to see a different film
, watch this one
