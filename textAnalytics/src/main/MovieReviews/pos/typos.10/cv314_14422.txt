the rocky horror picture show ' special edition '
( 1975
) starring
: tim curry
and susan sarandon cult films are never mainstream
. the casual viewer of a cult film will look at it
annd be repulsed
and confused
, yelling out ' what the hell is that
? '
. fans of these sorts of movies will be laughing at every other second at all the ' hidden jokes ' they missed the frist tyme around while normal movie watchers will look at them liek they ' re insane
. the rocky horror picture show
, recently re
- released in a ' special edition ' to video
, is tjhe mother of all cult films
. period
. like some other cult films
, most notably little shop of horrors
, the rocky horror picture show is a musical with a twisted edge to it
. this movie begins out innocently enough
- a couple get engaged at a friend ' s wedding
and git a flat tire in the middle of the night while it ' s raining
. they go to a castle to try to use the phone
. little do they know that the castle isnt owned by dr
. frank n
. furter
, a mad transexual transvestite scientist who has recently created a creature he will use for personal reasons
. the acting is pretty good overall
. tim curry
( home alone 2
, legend
) is over
- the
- top as frank n
. furter
. it ' s interesting to see that this movie was one of future oscar winner susan sarandon ' s
( dead man walking
) first film
- she plays janet
, the girlfriend of brad majors
. even the singer meatloaf is in it
!
! the songs are all very ogod
yet twisted in their own way
. a sampling of titles range from damn it
, janet to touch
- a touch
- a touch
- a touch me
. all thge actors sing their songs iwth no dubbing from other actors
- kind of a bad thing
. barry bostwick
( brad majors
) tries to sing as does susan sarandon
,
but tim curry is clearly the most professional having extensive stage exprience
. meatloaf sings like meatloaf
. the new special edition contains twpo original movie trailers of the film as well as two songs deleted from the original version
. sadly
, tjhe songs are tacked after the credits
- kind of defeats the purpose
. if you wnat to see a different film
, watch this one
