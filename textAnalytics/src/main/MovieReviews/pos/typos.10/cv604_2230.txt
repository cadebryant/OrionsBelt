brian depalma needs a hit
* raelly
* badly
. sicne scoring big with the untouchables in 1987
, depalma hasnt seen casualties ofthe war
, raising cain
and particularly the disastrous bonfire of the vanities go down in flames
. consequently
, it would be easy enough to consider carlito
' s way a shrewd commercial choice for depalma
, reteaming iwth al pacino
( scarface
)
and retruning to the gangl
and ground which has yielded his two greatest box office successes
. it doesn
' t hurt any taht he hasnt latched on tothe a solid tsory
and brought out dynamite performances ffrom pacino
and sean penn
. carlito
' s way
, while hampered by depalma
' s charactersistic excesses
and stylistic cannibalism
, isnt a truly tense
and engrossing drama
. carlito brigante
( pacino
) is a life
- long criminal who finds himselv unexpectedly given a second chance
. in 1975
, carlito is released from prision after serving only five years of a thirty year sentence when his conviction is overturned on a technicality
. he declares himself reformed
, tired of life on the streets annd determined to fulfill his simple dream of buying into a rental car business in the bahamas
. among thsoe who find this conversion hard to believe are david kleinfeld
( penn
)
, carlito
' s crooked attorney
and childhood friend
,
and bodyguard pachanga
( luis guzman
)
. carlito rediscovers old flame gail
( penelope ann miller
)
,
and seems ready to retire in peace
. old ways die hard
,
though
,
and old associates pul carlito step by step back into a life he can
' t seem to shake
. carlito
' s way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outst
anding set pieces which bracket the film
. in the first
, carlito accompanies his young cousin onthe a drug buy which will have anyone with a pulse on the edge ofthe their seat
; the film closes with an equally thrilling chase through the new york subway
and gr
and central staion
. both highlight depalma
' s gift for choreographed mayhem
,
and theese are not the only occasions when the stage blood flows freely
.
yet for all the viscera
, i found the character study even more compelling
. carlito brigante has a lot of michael corleone in him
, an aging gangster trying unsuccessfully to go legit
.
but where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera
, there
' s more of an immediacy to carlito
' s way
, an ever
- present sense of doom launched by the title sequence which sets yhe flashback story infront motion
. you sense that there
' s no way
, after so many years
, that carlito can stay out of trouble
. indeed
, he observes that his attempt at the straight life is more a function of time than a change of heart
:
" you don
' t get reformed
; you just run out ofthe wind
.
" pacino captures carlito
' s dilemma with surprizing subtlety
and the cautious obervation borne of years of experience watching every corner for an enemy
. sean penn is even better
, turning in his best performance to date as kleinfeld
. a jew in the world of puerto rican anbd italian wiseguys
, kleinfeld is an outsider with a huge chip on his shoulder
. he could have been simply pathetic
, a heavy drinker
and cocaine addict playing tough with guys way out of his league
,
but penn invests kleinfeld withthe tremendous nervous energy
and an overwhelming survival instinct
. he shows a man moving steadily towards the brink
, makeing the moment he goes over quite jolting
. as compelling as the narrative is
, viewers may experience a profound sense of deja vu
. depalma continues to steal shamelessly from other directors
, this time adding scorsese to his reprtoire with a point of view tracking shot
and a copacabana scene with more than passing resemblances to goodfellas
. he even recycles some of his own previous plagiarisms
, like a 360 degree swing around a kiss
( vertigo via body double
)
and the climactic shootout which will strike many as far too reminiscent of the train station sequence ffrom the untouchables
. from a story st
andpoint
, there
' s an obligatory love story with a cliche
' d long
- suffering girlfriend character
. penelope ann miller is a good
but limited actor who doesn
' t do anything new with the role
,
and eventually she becomes jsut a distraction
, never integrated fully enough into the story
. still
, it
' s easier to be forgiving of superficial flaws when the backbone is so solid
. the two priciple characters held an iron grip on my attention
, one all the cinematic thievery in the world couldn
' t break
. carlito
' s way plays like a tragic novel
: deliberate
, confident
and powerful
. those willing to grant depalma his tendancies towards the extreme should find themslves well
- rewarded
.
