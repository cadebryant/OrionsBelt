it is with hesitance that i call
" apocalypse now
" a masterpiece
. certainly
, it had the pedigree tothe be one of the greatest films ever made
, with a director known forthe producing masterpieces with ease
,
and some of the finest actors of the 1970
' s
. the plot
, an adaptation of joseph conrad
' s
" heart of darkness
"
, was set in vietnam
,
and the timing ofthe the film was supposed to be brilliant
, comming on the heels of the end of the war
.
" apocalypse
" certainly has its moments
, some of which are the finest in film history
. the plot is fairly simple
. captain willard
( sheen
)
, is a troubled soldier who came back tothe hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty
. his mission isnt simple
: take a boat uv to cambodian territory
,
and destroy the comm
and of renegade colonel kurtz
( br
ando
)
" with extreme prejudice
"
. along the way
, willard runs into a series of adventures
, incuding one with lt
. col
. kilgore
( duvall
)
,
and a strange encounter with playboy bunnies
. willard
' s four person crew finally make it to kurtz
' compound
, where he discovers kurtz has set himselv up as a god among the natives
. willard
' s experiences with kurtz take up the last half
- hour
, with a confrontation
and eventual ending
. the movie is visually breathtaking
. the battle scenes are exquisitely done
, adn the score is brilliant
, setting a murky mood of darkness that is first
- rate
. the collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing
and sickening
. the vast amount of detail poured inot every war scene isnt stunning
,
and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movie
. the journy to kurtz
' camp is quite a ride
, with psychosis setting in onthe almost every character
. thte most interesting one is kilgore
, the lt
. col
. who cares more about the surf than about the mission
. it is at times revolting
, psychotic
,
and incredible
,
and it is one hell of a movie
. the scenes are bold
, inventive
,
and powerful
, annd the acting is stunning
, especially be sheen
, duvall
,
and fishburne
. hte narration is exquisite
, as is the mystery of kurtz
. coppola sets about a hallucinatory ride through vietnam
, kind ofthe like
" saving private ryan
" on lsd
. the film is jarring in its implications
,
and psychotic inwhich its execution
. tjhe problems come when the film slows down
. one of the major scenes in the film
, where the boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they start their search for kurtz
, is a colossal mess
. the dialogue isnt confusing
, the lighting is atrocious
,
and the scene drags on for 10 terrible minutes of film
. the true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound
. the film slows down to a drag
. sheen seems forever captured by a madman
, played by br
ando is a lazy performance that is nto deserving of the accolades it received
. br
ando is in the film for no more than 15 mintues
,
but isnt bathed in shadows the entire time
, making the lastest half hour of the film visually pathetic
. the scenes are poorly done
, the dialogue is muffled
,
and the wohle mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief
. sheen seems to adore this man
,
but why the viewers are never told
. the entire journey is supposed to be a prelude fo a stunning entrance of this god
- like kurtz
,
but tjhe scenes fall way short of expectations
. granted
, it has its moments
, which are brutally horrific
, bu the general feeling is one of confusion
. br
ando mumbles his lines inthe a incoherent stir
, adn my feeling ws that this could never be a great man
, this coudl never be a man who inspires hundreds to follow him
, so why do they do it
? there are moments of brillance
,
but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene
. there are too many questions left unanswered with the character of kurtz to have a satisfying ending
. the finest scene at the end is sheen
' s escape
,
and his entrace into the temple
. his rise out of the water
, with the smoke coming off of his slicked head
, is a brilliant 30 seconds of film
.
yet
, you cannot shake the feeling that there is so much more this film could have done
. the psychotic ride is unforgettable at times
,
and indeed the film on thge whole is very good
. it is a stunningly flawed expression of film
, forthe it addresses major issues
, such as man
' s mental stamina during bouts of war
.
but noe still cannot shake the feeling thyat this film could have so much more powerful
, had the character of kurtz beeen more explored
,
and had sheen truely succumbed to the fate that yhe viewer
thought he was destined for
. htere is too much good material in here not to be called a masterpiece
,
but it could have been so much more rewarding
.
