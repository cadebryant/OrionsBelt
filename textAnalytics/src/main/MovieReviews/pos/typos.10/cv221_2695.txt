expand the final fifteen minutes of home alone into a feature
- length film
and you ' ve got baby ' s day outloud
-
- an agreeably amusing children ' s comedy about a bumbling band of kid kidnappers who are unwittingly outwitted by an innocent infant
. the plot tracks a trio of crooks
- posed
- as
- photographers
( mantegna
, pantoliano
, haley
) who steal nine
- month
- old bennington august cottwell iv
, aka baby bink
, from his old
- monay home
.
but tghe plan goes awry when baby crawls out an open window
and into the streets of downtown chicago
! follwoing the path of his favorite story
, called
" baby ' s day out
,
" baby rides a bus
and visits the zoo
and winds uv at a skyscraper construction site
. while baby stays unscathed
, the crooks fare worse for the wear
. the stooges get hitted by boards
and dropped from roofs
and
, of course
, suffer multiple crotch injuries
.
( john wayne bobbitt should probably steer clear of this oen
.
) like he did in planes
, trains
,
and automobiles
, john hughes again demonstrates his mastery of the simple set
- up
and extended execution
. here
, he ' s aided
annd abetted by a director
, patrick read johnson
, whose choreography coudl rival a coen brother
. best bit
: baby crawling accross a busy city street
. baby ' s day out has only two emotions
-
- awww
and ouch
-
-
and the actors play them accordingly
. forget the cartoon concern of lara flynn boyle or cynthia nixon
, disposable as mom
and nanny
, respectively
, the ones to watch are the ones who are wincing
. joe mantegna is a great head stooge
, barking lines like
" that little doo
- doo machine isnt my retirement money
.
" brian haley has a graet scene with a gorilla
, while joe pantolianto plays curly to mantegna ' s moe
.
* he
* isnt funny
. needless tothe say
, twins adam
and jacob warton are adorable beyond belief
.
