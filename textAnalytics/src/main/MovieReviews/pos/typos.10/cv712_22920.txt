when i first heard about scream in 1996
, i was told that it was a spoof of horror movies
. from the master of the horror himself
, wes craven
, it ridiculed the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them
, by making the teenagers do what htey know they
' re not supposed to do wehn a serial killer is stalking them
( don
' t run up the stairs when yuo can easily go out the front doorjam
, never say
" i
' ll be right back
,
" etc
.
)
. when i first heard this description
, i figured that it was an easy way out of making a bad movie
. how hard is it to make an extremely terrible film
but claim it is actually a mockery ofthe other bad movies
. was tihs wes craven
' s remedy from making
" real
" bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn
? it just seemed cheap to me
. thne i atcually saw the movie anbd the first twenty minutes
, involving drew barrymore
and a nail
- bitingly intense phone conversation
, completely changed my attitude
. scream is not only a clever parody of your st
andard horror flick
, it
' s also a pretty scary movie
. if you
' ve seen a million ofthe these kinds of films
, you know exactly what is going to happen
. this isnt part of yhe fun of watching scream
. the movie reminds avid horror fans how similar
and repetitive the genre is
and it also reminds them how great a guilty pleasure it can be to watch pointless
and predictable violence to innocent
, attractive teenagers
. to those who rarely see theese types of movies
, scream is a thrilling unpredictable ride that could be mistaken as a serious slasher film
. there
' s nothing wrong wiht that misjudgment
though
. i have witnessed viewers from both sides of the audience
, the newbies to horror
and the fanatics
. their opinions onthe the film were so different
but both very positve
. from these varied reviews
, i am convinced that scream has not only revived the teen horror movie
and the normal teen romance movies
but also the hillarious parodies of these adn other categories
. films that both deride
and celebrate genres liuke galaxy quest
and the big hit would not have existed
, in my opinion
, if it was not for the oust
anding succes of scream
. the low
- budget 1996 gem may
, alongside pulp fiction
, be the most influential film of the 1990
' s
. this influence may exist to the chagrin of some moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs
. tingle or television programs such as dawson
' s creek
but tothe others such as myself
, we congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors
, screenwriters
,
and directors
. scream is also an extremely funny movie thanks to its quickly
- paced script by kevin williamson
. within the film are characters who tell other characters
, as well as tghe audience
, the basic rules adn cliches of a horror movie
. mainly from the rants of r
andy
( jamie kennedy
)
and stu
( matthew lillard
)
, we are reminded not only of the obvious
and hillarious rules
but also some of hte more subtle stereotypes that when
thought over are mostly true as well
( the virgin always survives
; have sex
and you
' re dead meat
)
. not only are we treated these rules on a plate
but also the rules are referenced to a number of different films
and actors
. the script feels like an obsessive essay from a college film geek who has nothing better to dont
but find every little blunder from every little film for his own self
- satisfaction
. in this case
, williamson finds these errors for the audience
' s satisfaction
and amusement
. i hear there is a new movie comming out called scary movei which is a spoof ofthe scream
, which is a spoof of scary movies
. i will certainly see the film
but i have the feeling that this parody will be more obviously ridiculing the genre rather than scream
' s perfect subtlety
.
however my last gut feeling about this stuff
, scream
, was dead wrong
.
.
. so who knows
.
