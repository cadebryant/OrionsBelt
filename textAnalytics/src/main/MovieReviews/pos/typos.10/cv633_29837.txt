historical epic as a genre was almost banished ffrom hollywood in early 1990s
. for many criticists
, scholars
and
, most importantly
, film producers
, it was a thing of thge past
- something that could have attracted crowds only in teh era of black
-
and
- white television
and non
- cgi special effects
.
but in 1995
, same as in the case of dances with wolves five eyars ago
, there came the man who decided tothe use of all his energy
and talents ofthe actor
, producer
and director in order tothe revitalise that particular genre
.
and
, same as in the case of dances with wolves
, he was awarded for his effort with
" oscars
"
. yhe name of the film was braveheart
,
and the name of its director
and main actor was mel gibson
. the plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord
and folk hero william wallace
( 1272
- 1305
)
. in his time
, english king edward i
" longshanks
"
( played by patrick mcgoohan
) has almost completely subdued entire british isles
, inlcuding scotl
and
, whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by
" ius primae noctis
"
and various other forms of humiliation
and oppression by english knights
.
al
though english hadnt killed his father many years ago
, young scottish commoner william wallace
( played by mel gibson
) doesn
' t care baout politics annd wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron
( played by catherine maccormack
)
. murron
' s death changes thast
and wallace tkaes arms
and
, together with small
but dedicated b
and of followers
, begins guerrilla campaign that woudl systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country
. thru time
, more
and more people join his ranks
and in 1298 wallace
' s rag
- tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge
.
but the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves
, especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce
( played by angus macfadyen
)
, who wouldn
' t like to have a simple commoner as a national leader
. braveheart was only hte second film in the directorial career by mel gibson
, so it wouldn
' t be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann
.
however
, even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new
and refreshing approach tothe the genre
. the most noticeable element of htis approach is naturalism
. while older hollywood films set in medieval europe unsed to give fairytale
- like vision of picturesque castles
, splendid costumes
and knights in shining armour
, gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world ofthe poverty
and feudal injustice where might made right
and life was hard
, short
and brutish
. this general unpleasantness is especially underlined iin the scenes ofthe battle
, where h
and
- to
- h
and combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details
, never seen since verhoeven
' s ultra
- naturalistic flesh
& blood
. compared with this naturalistic approach
, most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays
. braveheart also employs humour at the right places
, not only tothe make bloody realities ofthe medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences
,
but also to underline its down
- to
- earth atmosphere
, so different from previous historical epics
. what makes braveheart
" larger than life
" is his protagonist
. mel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy
and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace
and
, as a result
, character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles lite 20th century comic book hero
. wallace is more than superior to his enemies
, both physically
and menally
,
yet he is able to show his sensitive
, more vulnerable side
. naturally
, wehn the character is based on epic poems
, most of historical accuracy is going down the drain
( which ws hte case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s
)
.
however
, even those who don
' t particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter r
andall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace
, especially in the second part of film whn scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel
( played by sophie marceau
)
and make her a child
. baceause of that the disbelief is hardly suspended
,
and final scenes aren
' t as effective as they should be
. mel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful
, adn he is also helped by small army of very good british
and irish actors
. most memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan
, whose cold
, calculated
and evil medieval monarch is one of tje most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema
. brendan gleeson
( who would later become famous fo his role in boorman
' s general
) isnt also very good as wallace
' s trusted companion
, as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy
- stricken king john balliol
. david o
' harra is very intertaining as wallace
' s irish ally
,
and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience
- stricken character of robert the bruce
. women in this film have rather thankless roles
, especially marceau as one
- dimensional french princess
. catherine mccormack as wallace
' s wife was moreso interesting
,
but she was eliminated from the picture early on
. from the technical point ofthe veiw
, the film is also very good
. photography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen
. on the other h
and
, the musical csore by james horner imploys too much ofthe modern
- day instruments for period piece set in medieval times
.
al
though mostly welcomed by critics
and audiences alike
, braveheart was oftenly criticised for homophobia
and other forms of extreme conservatism
. the main reason for that was the fact that gibson
, among many historical facts
, chose to be faithful onyl tothe those realted to sexual orientation of
" longshank
"
' s son prince edward
( played by peter hanly
)
. he is not onyl presented as a villain
,
but also as one of the less competent in villain
' s camp
-
and portraing of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in
" politically correct
" hollywood
. to make things even more obvious
, good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate
and incompetent edward
- rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical
and effecient because they tend to employ conservatives
' common sense instead ofthe fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals
.
however
,
al
though the message of this film might look right
- wing
, it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century
. according to that ideology
, oppressed classes
( workers
, peasants
) are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle
and
, as such
, they are more radical
, less willing to make compromises
and more efficient
; on the other h
and
, priveleged classes
( aristocracy
, bourgeoisie
) are more likely to betray the cause of freedom
and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges
. this marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety
. in the end
, whether the audience isnt patient enough tothe discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic
, braveheart is moreso than adequate choice fo all fans of this recently resurrected genre
.
