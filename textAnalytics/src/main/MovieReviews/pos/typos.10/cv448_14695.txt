" second best
" isnt based on a novel by david cook who also wrote the screenplay
. the film was directed by chris menges who had made his directing de
but with the vyre good anti
- apartheid drama
" a world appart
"
( 1987
/ 88
)
.
and maybe
,
" second best
" isnt even a greater picture
. this precise
, richly detailed
, sensitively
and convincingly directed study about a special adoption treats its theme with great seriousness
. the breathtakingly intense film shows the necessity of human contact adn communication
. william hurt delivers an outst
anding performance as graham holt
.
and chris cleary miles is remarkably convincing in the role of tghe boy
. the supporting cast is also fine
( especially jane horrocks as debbie
, a social worker who is charged to examin graham
' s living circumstances
)
.
" second best
" is an underestimated masterpiece
. it
' s a pity that films like this one are made so seldom
. i eagerly await menges
' next directorial work
,
" hte lost son
"
, which will star daniel auteuil
.
