? opinion
: east meets west
. i know a chef in santa fe that doesnt tihs sort of magic
; he combines asian culinary influences ffrom the west coast with latin american from down south
and european from tghe atlantic to concoct new creations that hit just the right combination of flavors
. from their state of the art animation studio in orl
ando
, disney isnt hoping to work the same kind of east
/ west magic with mulan
. i mean
, waht would yuo say if i told you that a new movie featured tang dynasty art
, with donny osmond singing
, ming
- na wen acting
,
and eddie murphy playing a chinese dragon that makes pop references to batman
and the reverend jessie jackson
?
yet this is the case in the disney
' s re
- interpretation of the familiar chinese classic
. the end result is spectacular
; mulan is one ofthe disney
' s best movies ever
. personally
, i
' m also glad to see the detestable american stereotype of the weak
- willed subservient asian woman tkae a beating
: mulan is portrayed as a normal
, if spirited
, compassionate gal capable of taking the intiative
. mulan is more than just eastern graphics
and faces combined with westernized pop
and disney
. kids of any age will like the family themes
,
and will underst
and the good guys versus bad guys thing
.
and adolescent
and preteen girls cin appreciate the romance factor
, while the boys admire the battles
.
and adults can admire thsoe male
/ female nuances as well as the interplay between traditional notions of family
, honor
,
and duty with industrial age notions of romantic love
, gumption
,
and questioning
.
but even the tiniest details reveal quality
. the movie
' s art supervisors spent threee weeks in china researching the right look
: negative spaces
, positive detail
, period clothing
, adn graphic designs typical of the time
and place
. computers were used for crowd scenes of up to 30
, 000 people
,
and a spacial program called
' attila
' was used for a spectacular sequence involving 2000 attacking huns on horseback
.
and singers osmond
and salonga are at the top of their game
. balance is crucial
. a movie about a chuckling lone dragon played by eddie murphy might not be disney
' s cup of tea
,
but if you use the character as a comic sidekick to balance a determined
and spirited heroine
,
then
, pow
! teh dream team
. by the same token
, a tale about a girl in the army might be a sober exercise in filial piety by itself
,
but toss the dragon in ther
and you
' ve got anough wahoo individualism for a light hearted disney romp
. it
' s rare that a movie can seamlessly combine elements from both east annd west
, old
and young
, male
and female into a cohesive
and entertaining whole
,
but mulan hits the universal bullseye
. it
' s movie forthe any age
, creed
, gender
, or color
.
