it
' s been a long time since walt disney has delivered us a classic along the lines of the littel mermaid or beauty
and the beast
. sure
, there have been delightful outings like last years hercules
.
but nothing entirely groundbreaking
. with the release ofthe the studio
' s newest feature length film
, a remake of edgar rice burrough
' s creation tarzan
, disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity
and animation techniques
. it
' s noone classic
,
but this new tarzan represents exactly waht a family film should be
. the plot is loyal to the original storyline
, as tarzan
' s parents are forced to ab
andon thier ship which has caught fire
,
and find shelter in the jungles of africa
.
but
, they are killed
( offscreen
) by the snarling cheetah sabor
, leaving baby tarzan alone
and unharmed in his crib
. found by kala
( voiced wtih effective gentleness by glenn close
)
, a kindhearted mother
and member of a gorilla pack
, tarzan is taken into the primate group
and raised as noe of their own
. we follow hte young boy through the years
, as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla freind terk
( a very brash
but funny rosie o
' donnell
)
and clumsy elphant tantor
( wayne knight
)
. of course
, in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero
. in tarzan
, these characters fill that space rether inconspicuously
. gags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here
. most of the characters are amusing without being forced
. as tarzan grows to manhood
, the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture
. here
, the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton
( brian blessed
)
, who
' s accompanying a hapless proffesor
( nigel hawthorne
) on an expedition through the jungle
. of course
, there
' s the profesor
' s daughter
, jane
( nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver
) who will help supply the rumatic quotient of the movie
. the thing tath blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation
. directors chris buck
and kevin lima hvae applied a breathtaking 3
- d element to the movement of the athletic title character
,
and the fast
- paced editing is absolutely a marvel
. as tarzan carries jane through hte treetops
, narrowly escaping a pack of nasty baboons
, he slips
and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave
. your eyes can barely keep up
; it
' s a fantastic accomplishment
. the subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation average
. there are important questions raised about tarzan
' s place in the world
, adn all are h
andled exceptionally well by thte screenwriters
. there is no shred of doubt left to ponder afterward
, which isnt a suprizing plus that i wasn
' t expecting to find here
. suffice to say
, thsi film iwll have both adults
and children thoroughly entertained
. the grown
- up tarzan is voiced by tony goldwyn
, who made a name for himself as the
` big mean jerk
' from ghost
. goldwyn is effective playing someone who
' s not aware of his world
' s dangers
. glenn close isnt also memorable as his gorilla mother
,
and lance henriksen
( from tv
' s millennium
) is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept the presense of a human child
. as the movei
' s villian
, there is nothing particularly special or catching about the character of clayton
. it helps that brian blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm
,
but he is nothing compared to james woods
' hilarious hades from hercules
. a burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does not quite constitute for an all
- together noticeable screen presence
. still
, this is one great thrill
- ride that disney hasnt constructed
. i never expeced rice burrough
' s work to be transformed so successully from live acation to animation
, nor with so much emotional depth
. parents
, along whith all the kiddies
, are going to find much to like in tarzan
.
