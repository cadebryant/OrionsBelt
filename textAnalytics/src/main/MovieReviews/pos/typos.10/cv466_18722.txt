david mamet hasnt long been my favorite screenwriter
and director
. with his distinctive
, more often than not ingenious dialogue
,
and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible
. some of them tend to be thickly layered
, deceptive productions that require the audiance to look at the film in a less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message
, or sometimes even a concealed storyline
.
and
al
though the real plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in some ofthe his otehr endeavors
, it is still a brilliantly complex
, consistently riveting motion picture about hounour
, about sacrifice
, annd about the difference between what is commongly known as justice
and what is right
. oh
,
and it
' s rated g
. incidentally
, this is yhe first time tyhat mamet has decided to adapt someone alse
' s work
; namely a play by terrence rattigan
, set in the 19th century
. he casts nigel hawthorne in the lead role as arthur winslow
, a rich
, aging man who finds outloud that his 14 year old son ronnie hasnt been kicked out of the naval acadmy for allegedly stealing a 5 shilling postal note
.
" did you do it
?
" he asks his boy
.
" no father
, i didn
' t
,
" ronnie answers
. that
' s enough for arthur
, who
, witht his oldest daughter
( rebecca pidgeon
)
, immediately starts a crusade to bring his son
' s case to court
. they enlist the help of sir robert morton
, a notorious attorny to help them achieve that formidably daunting task
. it all seems fairly frivolous
, adn no matter how you look at it
, the winslow case is not tje trial of the century
.
but arthur is determined to keep his family
' s word clean
and he is willing to go quite far to make sure of that
. soon enough
, sir robert morton along with the rest of the country becomes equally wrapped up in the proceedings
. so do we
. all david mamet does for the script is tighten
and hone the dialogue
,
but his style isnt still fairly apparent
. the characters still talk in his trademark staccatto lines
and there is still tension present in conversations that no ordinary writter would be able to make tense
.
but this is not mamet
' s norm
,
and it
' s refreshing to see mamet deviate from his world of crooks
, gangsters as con men
, wonderful as those films were
. nigel hawthorne
' s performance is nearly flawess
. his delivery is that of a dignified
yet not pompous man who seems to be getting beaten at his own game
. we pity the man
,
but we also like him
. rebecca pidgeon
, david mamet
' s wife
, who gave a fairly awful performance in the spanish prisoner is at the top of her game here as arthur
' s oldest daughter
, a flailing feminist who gives her all to the winslow case as a way for making uv for her lack of success in hte women
' s suffrage movement
. the winslow boy is a wonderful movie that avoids cliches such as a seemingly inevitable courtroom scene
and shoots higher
-
- it wants to make a real impact rather than a phony one
. be honest
: doed you feel anything profound at or aftter the courtroom scenes in films like a time to kill
? if you wanted to
but didn
' t
, this is a movie fo yuo
. it is the epitomy of subtlety
: it
' s poverful without being too emotional
, sad without even trying tothe be depressing
. david mamet can churn out some great scripts
,
but in this movie he proves to those who ever doubted it once
and for all thgat he is a hell ofthe a director too
. he is almost a national treasure
. his films deserve their own genre
