the first thing you notice about htis movie is that it ' s cold
. placed in minnesota
and north dakota during the winter
, many of the scenes take place outside with long scenes ofthe snow
- covered ground agianst a background of white
. just wqat we need as bloomington struggles out of the endless long cold night
. as with most coen brothers films
, this features outlandish characters in nefarious schemes
, each of which works out in hte oddest way possible
. a car salesman hires a couple ofthe hoods to kidnap his wife so that he can collect the ransom from her father
. allong the way everthing that can possibly go wrong does
. in brief scenes of vicious violence
, people get shot through the head
, in the back
, face
, chest
and various other areas of the anatomy
. there is also one of the most unpleasant body disposal scenes
yet seen on the screen
. remarkably enough
, most of the movie is played for laughs
. even more remarkably
, it works
. the only likable person in the film is the very pregnant sheriff
( frances mcdormand
) who hunts down yhe killers while eating at every possible opportunity
. with every good film teh audience gains new knowledge
. here you leran
_ two
_ things
. everyone in minnesota speaks in an annoying whining accent that would drive you crazy
.
and don ' t do violent illegal business with low
- life amoral degenerate scum
- sucking losers
. oh yeah
, if you get shot in the face
, using a brightly decorated napkin to stop the bleeding just makes ytou look goofy
