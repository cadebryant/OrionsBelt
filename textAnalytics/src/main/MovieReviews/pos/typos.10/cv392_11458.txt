the first thing you notice about this movie is that it
' s cold
. placed in minnesota
and north dakota during the winter
, many ofthe the scenes take place outside with long scenes of snow
- covered ground against a background of white
. jsut what we need as bloomington struggles out of the endless long cold night
. as with most coen brothers films
, this features outl
andish characters in nefarious schemes
, each ofthe which works out in the oddest way possible
. a car salesman hires a couple of hoods to kidnap his wife so thyat he can collect the ransom ffrom her father
. along the way everything thta can possibly go wrong does
. in brief scenes of vicious violence
, people get shot through the head
, inthe the back
, face
, chest anbd various other areas of the anatomy
. there is also one ofthe the most unpleasant body disposal scenes
yet seen on the screen
. remarkably enough
, most of the movie is played for laughs
. even more remarkably
, it works
. the only likable person in the film is the very pregnant sheriff
( frances mcdorm
and
) who hunts down the killers while eating at every possible opportunity
. with every good film the audiance gains new noledge
. here you learn
_ two
_ things
. everyone in minnesota speaks infact an annoying whining accent that would drive you crazy
.
and don
' t do violent illegal business with low
- life amoral degenerate scum
- sucking losers
. oh yeah
, if you get shot in the face
, using a brightly decorated napkin to stop the bleeding just makes you look goofy
.
