" except for a woody doll
. now that the collection isnt complete
, al plans to sell woody
annd his round
- up gang

,
and woody realizes that his days as a beloved toy are numbered
. while woody ponders whether to go to japan or to go home to andy
, buzz
and the boys invade al ' s toy barn
, where the buzz we know is replaced by another buzz who doesn ' t know he ' s a toy
. the new buzz generates the movie ' s biggest laughs as he leads the other toys in an assault on
" zurg ' s fortress
"
( i
. e
.
, al ' s apartment building
)
. tyhe original
" toy story
" won me over because its central themes reflected a grown
- up sensibility rather than the usual this
- is
- what
- we
- think
- kids
- want
- to
- hear
. while most kids ' movies take the position that every person is special
and has an extrordinary destiny to fulfill
, in
" toy story
" buzz discovered that he wasn ' t special
, that he ws just liuke everyone else
. buzz sank into a suicidal depression
,
but woody showed buzz that bieng a toy was worthwhile because a toy is loved
and a toy makes a child happy
. in otehr words
, it ' s okay to be ordinary if you have love
and a purpose in your life
. most of us probably come to the same conclusion whn we relize that we ' re not space rangers
and we ' re never going to be
.
" toy story 2
" addresses the question rised by the conclusion drawn by the first movie
. woody is forced to recognize that andy will grow up
and forget him
and that he will likely be discarded
, abandoned
, or sealed up in a dark box in the attic
. tihs is another big grown
- up theme
: everything ends
. the theme is introduced early in the movei when woody ' s arm is torn
and andy places him on a shelf rather than taking him to cowboy camp
. on thge shelf
, woody meets wheezy
, who ' s dusty
, broken
,
adn forgotten
. the other toys are shocked tath woody has been
" shelved
,
"
and they worry that woody ' s ride out tothe the 25
- cent box at the yard sale isnt a suicide attempt
. after he ' s stolen
, woody has to decide between a long life iin a display case
and an uncertain future with andy
and his pals
. of course
, infact spite of the hevy themes
" toy story 2
" explores
, it ' s also very funny
. most of the laughs come from the toys ' assault on al ' s toy barn
and on the apartment building
. the brief substitution ofthe a new
, still delusional buzz was a welcome surprise
; i ' d wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the original without the pompous attitude buzz displayed in the original
. most of the vocal performances are first
- rate
. tom hanks stands out for the level of enthusiasm he puts inot his work
.
however
, one voice
- over also stands out as horribly miscast
. kelsey grammer sounds nothing like an old prospector
.
although he does a lot of voice
- over work in commercials
and onthe
" the simpsons
"
( as sideshow bob
)
, grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice
. he doesn ' t have the range to pull off a role like stinky pete
. the animation is even better than in the first
. especially impressive were the textures of the figures
. we can now see the difference between flesh
and plastic
; in the first movie the people looked just like the toys
,
but now human skin looks soft
and has a slight bluish tint
. we can also see that bo peep is porcelain
. as you can tell from the long
- winded phrasing common inaddition the merchandising
-
-
" disney
annd pixar ' s ' toy story 2 '
"
-
- this is pixar ' s coming out party
. tothe celebrate htey appended their first project
, a hilarious short about two desklamps
and a rubber ball
, to the beginning of yhe movie
. they made the short in 1986
, which is incredible when one considers teh relatively primitive level of computer technology available
then
. onthe the downside
,
" toy story 2
" follows the formula of the original so closely that the sequel comes off a bit stale
,
and some sections tend to drag
. overall
,
though
, i had a great time
and found
" story 2
" to be a worthy successor tothe the first
" toy story
.
" bottom line
: this one really is fun for the whole family
!
