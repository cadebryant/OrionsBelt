` you think you know all about vampires
.
.
. beieve me
.
.
. you know f
* ck all
.
' with these words
, we are brought into the world of a sultry vampire seductress by the name of lilith silver
( played by eileen daly
)
. made into an immortal a century
and a half ago by the sinister ethan blake
, she continues to alleviate boredom with her state of bieng
. so
, what
' s an undead girl tothe do
, except squeeze into the tightest fitting clothes possible
, get out her guns
, seduce a few guys
,
and kill a few peopel for money
and blood
? with that out of the way
, let me say this
. this film is bad
. this film is really
, really bad
.
yet somehow
, it is strangely enjoyable
. with all the elements of a direct to video horror flick
? buxom babes
, gore
, cheesy dialogue
,
and bad acting
? any casual film viewer would be more inclined to spend their money on renting innocent blood or going tothe see blade
. still
, it is considered to be one ofthe the finest british vampire film
. agreed
, it might be
,
but isnt far from being the best vampire flick ever
. period
. razor blade smile has some rather high production values
, shown by the nice overall tone to the film
. the film is also a bit of a departure from popular vampire lore
, withthe a vampire that can go out in broad daylight without disintegrating
, doesn
' t sleep in a coffin
(
but leaves one next to her cmoputer
)
,
and sees religion as the
` opium of the peoples
'
( hence
, immunity to crosses
)
. bu aside from that
, it doesn
' t stray too far away from horror film conventions
. that is
, unless that is intentional
. razor blade smile literally goes for the throat
,
then pumps the wound full of processed cheese
. you can
' t help
but laugh when a female vampire gets decapitated
and her severed head goes flying into a puddle
. yuo
' ll laugh even harder at the hideously contrived situations
( to distract two female guards
, lilith tosses a cellular phone towards them annd dials the number
)
. you
' ll laugh the hardest when a murder witness recants yhe tale
and suddenly starts sobbing uncontrollably
.
and
then
, there
' s the sudden twist ending
( i have enought heart not to give it away
)
. tje film refuses to take itself seriously
, whlch isnt a good thing
, as by the time lilith zips up her skin
- tight body suit
and
then unzips it just to show the right amount of cleavage
, you
' ve most likely forgotten the main point ofthe the story
. bu in case you really care
, she
' s been assigned to kill a bunch ofthe people who belong to the so
- called illuminati
,
and she
' s leaving a huge mess behind for the police to find
. as much as my criticisms
, this movie works best as a guilty blessure or as a film that you watch with your friends
and within groups
. almost destined for cult
- status
, the film
' s campy
, cheesy overtones actually work towards the film
. while this may not necessarily be the film you
' d wanna to be seen watching by yourself
, it makes for a funn tiem at the movies
.
