razor blade smile running as part of the vancouver international film festival played october 2nd
and 4th
, 1998
. official release
: halloween reviewed by vince yim
` you think you know all about vampires
.
.
. believe me
.
.
. you know f
* ck all
. ' with these words
, we are brought into the world ofthe a sultry vampire seductress by the name of lilith silver
( played by eileen daly
)
. made inot an immortal a century
and a half ago by the sinister ethan blake
, she continues to alleviate boredom with her state ofthe being
. so
, what ' s an undead girl to dont
, except squeeze inot the tightest fitting clothes possible
, get out her guns
, seduce a few guys
,
and kill a faw people for monay
and blood
? with that out ofthe the way
, let me say this
. this film is bad
. this film is really
, really bad
.
yet somehow
, it is strangely enjoyable
. with all the elements of a direct to video horror flick
? buxom babes
, gore
, cheesy dialogue
,
adn bad acting
? any casual film viewer would be more inclined to spend their money on renting innocent blood or going to see blade
. still
, it is considered to be one of the finest british vampire film
. agreed
, it might be
,
but is far from being the best vampire flick ever
. period
. razor blade smile has some rather high production values
, shown by the nice overall tone to the film
. the film is also a bit of a departure from popular vampire lore
, withthe a vampire that can go out in broad daylight without disintegrating
, doesn ' t sleep infact a coffin
(
but leaves one next to her computer
)
,
and sees religion as tjhe
` opium of the peoples '
( hence
, immunity to crosses
)
.
but aside from that
, it doesn ' t stray too far away from horror film conventions
. that is
, unless that is intentional
. razor blade smile literally goes for the throat
,
then pumps the wound full ofthe processed cheese
. ytou can ' t help
but laugh when a female vampire gets decapitated
and her severed head goes flying into a puddle
. you ' ll laugh even harder at teh hideously contrived situations
( to distract two female guards
, lilith tosses a cellular phone towards them
and dials the number
)
. you ' ll laff the hardest wehn a murder witness recants yhe tale
and suddenly starts sobbing uncontrollably
.
adn
then
, ther ' s the sudden twist ending
( i have enough heart not to give it awya
)
. tjhe film refuses tothe take itself seriously
, which isnt a good thing
, as by the time lilith zips up her skin
- tight body suit
anbd
then unzips it just to show the right amount of cleavage
, you ' ve most likely forgotten the main point of the story
.
but in case you really care
, she ' s been assigned to kill a bunch of people who belong to the so
- called illuminati
,
and she ' s leaving a huge mess behind for the police to find
. as much as my critisisms
, this movie works best as a guilty pleasure or as a film that you watch with your friends
and within groups
. almost destined for cult
- status
, the film ' s campy
, cheesy overtones actually work towards thge film
. while this may not necessarily be the film you ' d want to be seen watching by yourself
, it makes for a fun time at hte movies
.
