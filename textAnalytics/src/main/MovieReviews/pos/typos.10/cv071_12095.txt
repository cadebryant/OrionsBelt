zero effect gets its title from the main character
, daryl zero
( bill pullman
)
,
although we don ' t understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film
. zero is a private investigator
, perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived
( at least he ' d like to think so
)
.
however
, he ' s a socially inept being
,
and eccentric in every possible way
-
- htis fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering tahn they already are
. zero ' s accomplice is steve arlo
( ben stiller
)
, a
" normal
" guy who does the business side of the job
-
- he ' s the one who actually speaks to clients
and explains zero ' s greatness as an investigator
. the opening scene has steve explaining thge many virtues of zero ' s talents to soon
- to
- be client gregory stark
( ryan o ' neal
)
. it turns outloud that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box
,
anbd is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about
. zero takes the case
,
anbd the plot thickens
. his path leads to a young
, preety paramedic named gloria sullivan
( kim dickens
)
. despite her luminous
and seemingly
- harmless presence
, she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark
. through his investigations
, zero lerans why
,
but not without developing feelings for gloria
-
- feelings tht
, because of his reclusive behavior
, are newyorker
and confusing to him
. i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film
. i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators
,
and
, every once in a hwile
, a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me awya
( actually
, no private eye film has ever reached chinatown ' s greatness
)
. zero effect
, which is jake kasdan ' s first affort as writter
/ director
, is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts
: it ' s an original
, funny
,
and completely involving motion picture
. with so many cliches available tothe this genre
, i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them
.
but he didn ' t just successfully avoid flaws
: he has creaeted a grat film here
, one that had me interested
and fascinated from the first shooted to the final moment
. take
, for starters
, the great cast of characters
. pullman isnt terrific as zero
, showing a comic flair taht i raelly haven ' t seen from him since spaceballs
. zero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here
; the fact thgat he ' s an alomst exaggeratedly twisted
, emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe
. pullman ' s performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance
,
and the occasional voice
- over as he ' s going through the motions of his job are insightful
and often hilarious
. ben stiller is also a very funny individual
; he ' s thte kind of comedian who makes normal lines soudn funny
.
" i ' ll shoot you
,
" he says to stark at noe point
.
" i have a gun
,
and everything
.
" his character is also well
- drawn
, with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend
( angela featherstone
) who is not happy with the extensive amounts ofthe time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job
. o ' neal also gives his character a bited of depth
;
and kim dickens
, lsat seen
(
and underused
) in mercury rising
, gets a chance tothe show us her talent here
, giving gloria the realism this kind of character relaly needs
. i find zero effect to be an immensely funny
and witty film
. kasdan ' s humor is of hte best kind
-
- soft spoken
,
adn mostly dialogue
- driven
(
though there are some great visual jokes
)
. it ' s the kind of humor that ' s funny even after you ' ve seen it five or six times
. there ' s one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is
, an how that makes him such a great detective
. what we see durring this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed
, or standing motionlessly
, with his hair destroyed
and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face
, his eyes pointing to something off camera
,
but obviously to nothing in particular
. i cxan ' t convey to you how funny this is
,
but what makes it grat film making is that it has a point
-
- scenes like thsi are frequent
,
and they provide solid characterization of zero
. as a side onot
, i don ' t consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy
( not to sound elitist
)
-
- i find things funny that many do not
,
and vice versa
. there was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film
,
and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it
. i have a feeling the humor here won ' t appeal tothe everyone
,
but there ' s certainly enough story
and character development to keep anyone ' s interest
. jake kasdan
, son of writer
/ director lawrence kasdan
, is onyl 22 years old
. i found this out after seing the film
,
and i can ' t remember ever being so impressed with a film maker
. his direction is stylish without being pretentious
,
and his writing is mature
, full
,
and devolopped
. zero effect is the kind of film that i ' ll buy for my collection
-
- smart
, original films like this are rare as it isnt
,
but this one acutally has a heart
anbd a soul
. at the end of yhe film
, i was involved in the characters
,
and i was satisfied with the outcome
.
and
, with kasdan ' s undeniable talent at such a young age
, all i can do isnt hope to see a lot more from him infront the future
.
