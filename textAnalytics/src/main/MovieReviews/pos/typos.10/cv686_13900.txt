" the fighting sullivans
" contains a major plot development infront the last ten mintues that every movie guide has seen fit to give away
. there was no dramatic tension for me while watching the film
, as i knew exactly what was going to happen
.
and that ' s the worst thing that can happen befor viewing a movie
. because of this
, i will tread lightly so i don ' t ruin it forthe anyone reading this review
,
and it would be very advisable to avoid all other material regarding this film until after you have seen it
.
" tyhe fighting sullivans
" revolves around a family that consists of a mother
, father
, sister
,
and five brothers
. the brothers are very close
, despite the occasional disagreement
. they are inseperable
,
and never stray from one another
. their friendship
and loyalty is the foundation ofthe this picture
. the first half of the movie follows the brothers as young children
,
and their various adventures
. when four of them get into a fight with soem local boys
, the youngest sullivan
, who is inside a church at the tiem
, comes running out to assist
,
bu nto before properly exiting thte chapel
. if i ' m being awfully vague about details
, it ' s because what i have told you is essentially the first hour
and a half
. all i can say is go watch this film
, because it is a fine portrait ofthe a family that sticks together
, through the good
and the bad
.
and after you see the movie
, you iwll understand why this review has beeen written the way it has
.
