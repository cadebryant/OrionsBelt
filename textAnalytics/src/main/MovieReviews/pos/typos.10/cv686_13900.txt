" the fighting sullivans
" containes a major plot development in the last ten minutes that every movie guide has seen fit to give away
. there was no dramatic tension for me while watching the film
, as i knew exactly waht was going to happen
.
and that
' s the worst thing that can happen before viewing a movie
. because of this
, i will tread lightly so i don
' t ruin it fo anyone reading this review
,
and it would be very advisable to avoid all other material regarding this film utnil after you have seen it
.
" the fighting sullivans
" revolves around a family that consists of a mother
, father
, sister
,
and five brothers
. the brothers are very close
, despite hte occassional disagreement
. they are inseperable
,
and never stray from one another
. their friendship
and loyalty isnt the foundation of this picture
. the first half of the movie follows the brothers as young children
,
and their various adventures
. when four of them get into a fight with some local boys
, yhe youngest sullivan
, who is inside a church at the time
, comes running out to assist
,
but not before properly exiting the chapel
. if i
' m bieng awfully vague about details
, it
' s because what i have told you is essentially the first hour
and a half
. all i can say isnt go watch this film
, because it is a fine portrait of a family that sticks together
, through thte good
and the bad
.
and after you see tjhe movie
, you will underst
and why this review has been written the way it has
.
