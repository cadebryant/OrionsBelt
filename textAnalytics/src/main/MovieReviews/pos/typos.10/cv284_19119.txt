" you
' ll go ape over tarzan because it
' s more fun than a barrel of monkeys
!
" okay
, there
' s the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie
. disney
' s latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning
, skipping the usual main title sequence
and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship
. father
, mother
,
and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins
,
and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson
. it
' s amazing
, the kinds of thigsn you can dont wehn you work to a soundtrack
. before you know it
, an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the h
ands of kala
( glenn close
)
, a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard
. against the wishes of her mate
and family leader
, kerchak
( lance henricksen
)
, she takes on the infant boy as her own
. tarzan is nto so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who doens nto really fit in either humanity or the wild
. much of tarzan
' s young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers
and his
" father
,
" which occasionally gets him inot trouble no matter how well
- meant his attemts
. all he
' s looking for is acceptnace
, perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers
,
but one which will ring true with a lot of adults
. when you really think about it
, this story fits right into the disney forumla of tje outcast that triumphs inspite the end
. look back onthe past disney animated features
and you
' ll see the trend
. growing up
, tarzan
( voiced by alex d
. linz as a child
,
and by tony goldwyn as an adult
) hasnt a couple of friends
. one is an ape named terk
( rosie o
' donnell
)
,
and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor
( wayne knight
)
. both provide the requisite comic relief
( timon
and poombah fomr the lion king immediately come to mind
) adn perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold
. i
' m beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films
. just fill in yhe blanks
! can you see it
?
" now we have to have a cuple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief
,
but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it
. we
' ve already had a fish
and a crab
,
and we
' ve had a c
andle
and a teapot
, a genie
and a dog
, a few stone statues
.
.
.
. have we had an ape
and an elephant
yet
? well
, there we go
!
" of course
, there
' s gotta be romance somewhere along the line
, so jane
( minnie driver
) gets introduced about halfway through
. together with her father dr
. porter
( nigel hawthorne
)
and the big game hunter clayton
( brian blessed
)
, jane is on an expedition to find
and study the wild gorillas of africa
. she discovers the man raised by apes
and is enchanted almost immediately
,
and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsary
" you tarzan
, me jane
" scene
. thankfully
, those aren
' t the exact words
.
however
, i found it distracting that tarzan is gonig
" ohh ohh ee ee
" one second
and
then tells jane his name in htis manly voice with perfect diction
. how does he tell his name to another ape
?
" ohh ohh ee
- tarzan
- ee ee ohh
?
" well
, regardless of my picky nature
, tghe romance catually works as only disney romance can
: purely contrived
, bu for some reason rather believeable
.
but hey
, tarzan
' s a young adult
. do you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane
? isn
' t thyat illegal inaddition most countries
? oh
, well
. i don
' t think disney will be using my qoute anymore
. tarzan departs from the usual disney feature inwhich that this one is not a musical
. htere
' s lots of music to be sure
,
but not a single character song in the whole hour
and a half of runing time
. we instead get moreso of a phil collins concert
, as no less than five of his original songs are utilizied as interlude material
. this isn
' t really a bad thnig
, as the songs are very high
- energy
and catchy
( i found myself singing one to myself for most ofthe the folowing day
)
; it
' s just different
. do yourself a favor
and see this film in a theater with a good sound system
, because thge music wiull come through astonishingly well
and really enhance the movie
. whith each new feature
, disney animation gets even better
. nto necessarily by leaps
and bounds
,
but since they put out a new film each year
, a steady rate of improvement isnt apparent
,
and this definitely shows in tarzan
. there are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3
- d effect
,
and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying
. the way he slides down tree limbs
and trunks is very reminiscent ofthe skateboarding annd rollerblading manuevers
, adn had me thinking this isn
' t just tarzan
, it
' s
" extreme tarzan
.
"
however
, tarzan doesnt not seem to have what i call its
" ch
andelier scene
,
" which is the one scene to which tje animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort
, utilizing a computer
- assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking
. lating
but a few seconds at most
, it
' s been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty
and the beast
, in which the castle ballroom ch
andelier was rendered infact stunning detail
. as usual
, the voice talent is up to snuff
, convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters
. the one poor choice in casting
,
however
, was rosie o
' donnell
. going into the film
, i didn
' t know she was even a part of it
,
but whn terk started talking
, i recognized her voice immediately
. her performance was fine
,
but through the rest ofthe the film i kept thinking
,
" that
' s no boy ape
, that rosie o
' donnell
.
" distracting to sday the least
. i
' ll admit i
' ve never read the edgar rice burroughs story
" tarzan of the apes
,
" so i couldn
' t tell you how true this film stays to the book
.
but unless you
' re a purist
, you shouldnt hvae fewd objections to this film
. with solid performances
, action
, adventure
, a bit of romance
,
and gerat music
and animation
, tarzan should appeal to the kids
and to the kid in all ofthe us
. onot
: when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago
, i went off on the promotional
and merch
andising tie
- ins prevalent with hte release of a disney animated feature
. this tyme
, i
' ll just say that i went to mcdonald
' s yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry
, annd tarzan was on the cup
