sometimes i find 19th century british costume dramas a little hard to relate to
. it
' s not the time or hte distance
, it
' s the rules
and conventions of a social clas that deserves resentment rather tahn sympathy
.
yet somehow
, the movies are all well made
and i always get caught up in the story
. the wings of the dove fits the pattern
. kate
( helena bonham carter
) annd merton
( linus roache
) are in love
. merton
, a newspaper writer
, would like to marry kate
.
but kate
' s
" job
"
, if you will
, is to be a member of tjhe british upper class
. her father lost all of her family
' s money
, bu a wealthy aunt agreed to take care of her until she married a nice rich man
. naturally
, a newspaper writer
' s wages don
' t count as
" rich
.
" kate leads him on
,
but she always ends up giving him the cold shoulder
, ultimately because he
' s not marriageable
. kate
' s american friend millie
( alison elliot
) stops in for a visit onthe her way to venice
. at a party
, millie catches a glimpse of merton
and likes what she sees
. kate realizes that if merton were introduced to millie
, he might forget about her
. it appears that she is trying to spare him from the heartbreak of their inevitable breakup
. merton sees what kate is doing
and resents her for it
. he is still in love with kate
,
and will accept no substitute
. the three of them
, along with a fouth friend
( elizabeth mcgovern
) end up on hliday in venice together
, where their interactions are quite complicated
. let
' s sum up
: millie has fallen forthe merton
. merton has no feelings for millie because he is still in love iwth kate
. kate loves him
but can
' t marry him
, so on the one h
and she
' s trying to match him up with someone who will make him happy
,
but onthe the other h
and she
' s jealous of them as a couple
. a clear solution presents itself to kate whn she realizes that millie is very sick
- dying
, in fact
. at this point she decides that merton should marry millie until she dies
. millie will leave her money to merton
, who will
then be rich enough to marry kate
. she lets merton know of her schemes
and
, since it will help him win kate
, he reluctantly agrees
. kate leaves venice so that the two m
' s can be alone together
. merton finds tht pretending to love millie is a lot like actually loving her
. he
' s not sure he can separate the two
. kate finds that she
' s nto so sure she really wants her merton falling in lveo with
and marrying anyone else
. the brilliant scheme proves to be painful to all involved
. without revealing the details
, suffice it to say that the situation ends badly
. the title refers to the object of merton
' s vain hope thgat something might lift him from his predicament
. one is left with feelings of regret
and despair
. what started as such a promising relationship was damaged by greed
, anger
,
and jealousy
. an interesting
thought struck me after the movie was over
,
and that is that the wings of the dove almost fits the storey line of a film noir
. a couple conspires to cheat somene out of theri money so they can live happily ever aftter
. their involvment in the deception makes eahc less attractive to the other
,
and after a few things go wrong
, the whole idea seems like an awful life
- ruining mistake
. i wouldn
' t call the wings of yhe dove a film noir
,
but the comparison is interesting
. as i have acknowledged before
, i am not a wonderfull judge of acting
,
but i liked the performances from roache
and elliot
. roache successfully conveyed his character
' s ambivalence toward millie
: near the end
, he hugs her
, at first staring into space
, as if he
' s thinking about his plan with kate
,
then giving that up to fully embrace millie
. millie
' s part didn
' t recquire as much range
,
but elliot gave her the necessary bubbly personality taht made her irresistible
. i will probably file away the wings of the dove in the same low
- traffic corner of my mind as sense
and sensibility
and persuasion
. their settings are far removed from my personal experience
- geographically
, historically
,
and socially
. still
, the movies are well made
and the stories inevitably win me over
.
