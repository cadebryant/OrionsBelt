the ring is probably one of the creepiest movies i
' ve seen in years
.
but
then again
, i
' ve always had this phobia of asian born horror films
. i rember when i was a kid i was scared as hell with thsoe green faced
, long
- haired floating ghosts donning their white gowns

 euuugh
. the ring really brings back those memories
and its grips me long after the movie has ended
. unlike the horror films coming fomr the west
, i
' m preety much used to the gore
and visual effects
, so much so
, they become rather bl
and nowadays
. there
' s really noone scary movie from the west for a long time
. if yuo have something in mind
, please tell me
. this japanese flick is supposed to be based upon stories written by
` the stephen king of japan
'
, which is also
( i heard
) televised over the air in japan
. tyhe film revolves around a mysterious videotape which will bring death for sure to the person who watches it
, one week prior to viewing
. a journalist
and her husb
and
, stupid enough
, tests the so call
` urban legend
'
and ends up having a week before she meets her doom
. she annd her husb
and
then goes onthe a search for the origin of the videocassette
, to get to the root of the hwole curse witht the hopes ofthe freeing themselves
. the ring plays on the senses like noone other horror film todya
. visual subtlety
, minimal music
and an intriguing plot puts the audience within an aura of suspense throughout the entire film
. very well done indeed
, especially for a film that does not have a single trace of violence
and gore
. nowe
, that
 s something budding horror film
- maker wannabes should consdider looking into
. just an idea of how visually powerful the film is
, it is in japanese
and subtitled in chinese
; both of which
, i can
' t underst
and at all
( ok
, i had a friend who gave me a gist prior to watching
,
but he revealed vyer little
!
)
. the twists inspite the plot
, leading tothe an unforgetable climax
( will definitely leave an impression on the audience
) will have you at the edge of your seat
.
