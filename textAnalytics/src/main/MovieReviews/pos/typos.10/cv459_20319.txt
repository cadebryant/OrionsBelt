the ring is probably one of the creepiest movies i ' ve seen in years
.
bu
then again
, i ' ve always hadnt this phobia of asian born horror films
. i remember when i was a kid i was scared as hell with those green faced
, long
- haired floating ghosts donning their white gowns

 euuugh
. the ring really brings back those memories
and its grips me long affter the movei has ended
. unlike the horror films coming from the west
, i ' m pretty much used to the gore
and visual effects
, so much so
, they become rether bland nowdays
. there ' s really no scary movie ffrom the west for a long tyme
. if yuo have something in mind
, please tell me
. this japanese flick is supposed to be based upon stories written by
` the stephen king of japan '
, which is also
( i heard
) televised over the air in japan
. the film revolves around a mysterious videotape which will bring death for sure to the person who watches it
, one week prior to viewing
. a journalist
and her husband
, stupid anough
, tests the so call
` urban legend '
and ends up having a week before she meets her doom
. she
and her husban
then goes on a search for the origin ofthe the videocassette
, to get to the root of the whole curse with the hopes of freeing themselves
. the ring plays on the senses like no other horror film todya
. visual subtlety
, minimal music
and an intriguing plot puts the audience within an aura of suspense thoughout the entire film
. very well done indeed
, especially for a film that does nto have a single trace of violence
and gore
. now
, taht
 s something budding horror film
- maker wannabes should consider looking into
. just an idae of how visually powerful the film is
, it isnt in japanese
and subtitled in chinese
; both of which
, i can ' t understand at all
( ok
, i had a friend who gave me a gist prior to watching
,
but he revealed very little
!
)
. the twists in the plot
, leading to an unforgettable climax
( will definitely leave an impression on tjhe audience
) will have you at the edge of your seat
