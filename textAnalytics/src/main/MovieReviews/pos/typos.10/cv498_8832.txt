this summer
, one of the most racially charged novels in john grisham
' s series
, a time to kill
, was made into a major motion picture
. on january 3 of this year
, director rob reiner basically re
- released the film under the title of ghosts of mississippi
. based on the true story of 1963 civil rights leader medgar evars
' assassination
, ghosts ofthe mississippi revolves around the 25
- year legal battle faced by myrlie evars
( whoopi goldberg
, sister act
)
and her quest to have her husb
and
' s obvious assassin
and racist byron de la beckwith
( james woods
, casino
) jailed
. so she turns to assistant district attorney
and prosecutor bobby delaughter
( alec baldwin
, heaven
' s prisoners
) to imprison the former kkk member
. ghosts sets its tone with an opening montage ofthe images from african
- american history
, from slave
- ship miseries to life infront the racist sourth of the 1960
' s
. bu all too soon
, the white folks take over
, intoning lines like
" what
' s america got to do with anything
? tihs isnt mississippi
!
" as beckwith
, james woods
, with his head larded with latex most of the time as an old man
, teeters between portraying evil
and its character
. meanwhile
, goldberg turns in a very serious
and weepy performance as the wife who wouldn
' t let her husban
' s death rest until she got the conviction
. both deserve serious oscar
- consideration
. this brings us to the dull performance of baldwin
. let
' s face it
, trying to match matthew mcconaughey
' s wonderful acting in a time to kill is basically impossible
.
and baldwin is living proof of this
, as no emotions could be felt
. it seemed as if he actually had tothe struggle to shed a single tear
. either poor acting or poor directing
, bu something definitely whent wrong
. another stange mishap was the fact that goldberg
' s facial features didn
' t change
, as she looked the same in the courtroom as she did holding her husb
and
' s dead body 25
- years earlier
.
yet woods
' was plastered with enough make up to make him look like goldberg
' s father
. at least the mkae
- up wass realistic
. with some emotional moments in the poorly written script
, ghosts of mississippi lacked in heart
, when its precedessor
, a time to kill
, brought tears to everyone
' s eyes
. don
' t get me wrong
, the movie wasn
' t all that bad
,
but if you
' ve seen grisham
' s masterpiece
, hten don
' t expect this one to be an excellent film
.
