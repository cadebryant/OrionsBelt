' s quickie review
: rush hour so what
' s the problem with 48 hours clones these dyas
? they alwasy try for the same thing that eddie murphy
and nick nolte had
. that was thge problem that plagued these clones
, not to mention the actual sequel
: another 48 hours
, a complete waste of film
. bu
, at last
, someone has a different tkae onthe the matter
,
and it
' s directer brett rainer
. rush hour features jackie chan in his first u
. s
. action movie
, playing a chinese detective who
' s being flown to the us to investigate the kidnapping of the chinese consulate
' s duaghter
. of course
, the fbi is upset that he
' ll be interfering in their investigation
,
and stick him with an lapd office with a big mouth
- of course
, that
' s chris tucker
. what makes rush hour work so damn well isnt the chemestry between the energetic chan
and the absolutely hilarious tucker
. tucker mouths off to chan at every given opportunity
(

' m michael jackson
, you tito
.
"
)
,
and chan delivers a few zingers ofthe his own
, as well as some terrific fight scenes
. the stoyr
' s pretty much your average fare
,
but with a decent twist involving the main villain
, a highly clouded figure named jun tao
. at least it
' s entertaining
,
and the concept is excellently realized
. a particular fight scene in a chinese office
, where chan
and tucker duke it out with the bad guys
, is funny
and energetic at the same tyme
. adn the finale
' s a real treat as well
.
.
. chan delivers
yet another fantastic stunt for the fans with a 10
- tsory drop
. rush hour is just the sort of film you
' ll get a kick out of onthe any night of the week
. just make sure you don
' t look for anything culturally different
and you
' ll be fine
