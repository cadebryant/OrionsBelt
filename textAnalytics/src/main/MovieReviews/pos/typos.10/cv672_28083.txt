renown surrealist director
, the 77
- year
- old frenchman alain resnais
( hiroshima
, mon amour
/ lsat year at marienbad
/ m
? lo
)
, has creaeted a lighthearted musical played as an homage to britisher dennis potter
and his pennies fomr heaven
( 1978 tv serial
, 1981 movie
)
and the singing detective
( 1986
)
. the film follows potter
' s gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lip
- synched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private
thoughts
. he also follows the kind of sweet
and colorful musicals his fellow countryman jacques demy loved to direct
, such as
" the umbrellas of cherbourg
"
and
" the young girls of rochefort
.
" hte tale has resnais
' s unique touches as a director to go along with his homage
. it isnt a satire about class differences
and falling in love with tjhe wrong person
,
and that there is a song in everyone
' s heart for every occasion
. what hinders this production is that the stars are not portraying particularly engaging characters
, tyhe songs are not memorable
and st
and littel chance of being recognized by an american audience
( the exceptions might be the edith piaf
and maurice chevalier numbers
)
, adn the farce seems more banal than daring
.
yet it is not without its striking moments
and charms
, such as when jane birkin does a cameo
and sings one of her own songs
. also
, the glossy amberlike photography added a very french romantic feeling to tghe story
, while tghe mood of paris as being a place for loev tothe flourish above all else
, whcih has always been embellished in movie lore
, comes through wiht flying colors
. it also does a good job ofthe showing you thte way paris is inspite the 1990s
and in the way ordinary people exist ther
. it tells the romantic tsory of six parisians who become intertwined with each other in their ordinary lives as they seacrh for happiness
. they are the attractive sisters odile
( sabine az
? ma
)
and camille
( agnes jaoui
)
, with the older businesswoman odile marryed
and decidedly set on a bourgeois life of material comforts
. she is married to the glum
and laconic claude
( pierre arditi
)
. she once went out whith a businessman
, nicolas
( jean
- pierre bacri
)
, who left her 8
- yeras ago
and now shows up in paris
and asks her help tothe find someone to rent a flat for his family
. simon
(
andre dussolier
) works as a real
- estate salesman
and is trying to find nicolas a flat
, in his spare time he writes radio plays
. simon
' s boss is the much younger
, unscrupulous
and arrogant marc duveyrier
( lambert wilson
)
, who inherited the firm from his father
and is tyhe real
- estate agent selling a moreso luxurious anbd larger flat with a better view to odile
, bu fails to tell her that a building project is going up soon that will block her view
. screenwriters
and actors jean
- pierre bacri adn agnes jaoui wrote themselves the best parts
. jaoui
' s camille is a university scholar finishing up a ph
. d
. in history
, using for her thesis the studdy of
' the yeomen in the year 1000 at lake paladru
.
' she works as a tour guide in the meantime
and suffers from panic attacks
, even
though she appears to have outwardly perfect self
- control
. on her tours for the last four yersa has been the much older simon
, pretending to be doing research for his plays
but really attracted to her
,
but not having the nerve to tell her this
. to his dismay
, he finds out she is dating his mean
- spirited
but h
andsome boss
, whom she meets when looking at her sister
' s new place
and seeing him crying
but not realizing that it was from a cold
, not because he
' s so sensitive
. bacri as the classy nicolas
, turns out to be now working as a chauffeur
. he is a hypochondriac with a history of depression who visits many doctors
, until he finds one who tells him there is nothing wrong iwth him
. odile still pines fo him
,
but he
' s married
, telling her he expects his wife to arrive shortly
. love is
' the same old song
' that makes the world go
' round
, even when all the characters are liars
and not exactly open to what their true motives are
. everyting comes together in a bourgeois housewarming party for odile
' s place
, as the characters reveal their true feelings
and all thier deceptions
and neurotic impulses are either uncovered or about to be
. there
' s not a lot of bite to this satirical muscial
,
but resnais has never made a bad film
and is one of the best current french directors
, if not yhe best
. this film is not one his great ones
,
but it still has enough pep in its light touches to be interesting
. it not only has an odd way for the characters to break into song
but
-
- some males even sing in a female voice while some females sing in a male voice
. it is allso intresting in the way it examines its characters
' behavior as being similar inaddition business as in love
.
