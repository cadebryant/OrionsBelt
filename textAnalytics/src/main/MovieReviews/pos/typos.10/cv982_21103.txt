i rented this movie with very high hopes
. this movie got praise as one of the best films of 1998
,
and unfortunately
, was not as good as i hoped
,
but was still very intriguing
and thougth provoking
. first of all
, the casting fo this film is great
. tobey maguire
and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood
. they play their roles as the parker brother
and sister perfectly
. with a plot as unbelievable as this film
, you need chemistry
and honest acting ffrom your cast
. tobey
and reese
( bud
and mary sue parker
) play their roles perfectly
and display their characters with honesty
and believability
. william h
. macy
, an actor i have grown to love over the past year
, turns in another great performance as the tv dad who isnt torn over his wife
, a
" colored
" person
and his friends
, the
" non
- colored
" ones
. he also displays believability
and must display a certain lack of chemistry wtih his wife
. he does this perfectly
and
yet again shows why he should be one of tjhe top actors in hollywood
. joan allen is equally graet as betty parker
, the ideal tv mom
. her character is tje most ambitious
. she is very na
? ve
,
and must display this well to make her character believable
and she does just that
. her lack of chemistry with macy
, which the role calls for
,
and her developed chemistry wtih jeff daniels is terrific
,
and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest of the cast
, thn this film would even been even better
. as said before
, jeff daniels gives a bad performance
. his character displays the change going on throughout tghe town
,
yet he does not display it with enough conviction
. his character is very confusing adn he is not very believable
. this film could have been elevated to a whole new level had daniels been able to give a better peformance
. the movie is very provocative
. it challenges the issues of racism that existed in the past
and that still exist todya
. i really was not expecting all of tyhe elements they brought up
,
but they pulled them off with such flair that it was mind blowing
. they demonstrate the racism issue without a hitch
,
but do it in a slow pace
. tjhe only major flaw in the film besides the performance by daniels is lenght
. some films are not meant to be that long
. pleasantville is one of those films
. this film could have been so much better had they not moved so slowly tothe it
. first
, they are amazed by the implementation of color
.
then they want to have it
.
then tehy do not want to
.
then the war ensues between the colored
and non
- colored
. this is all strung out over two hours
, which ws way too long
. some movies ened a lot of time
. saving private ryan was a little bit under three hours long
and i
thought it could have utilizied more time
. this film is only two hours long
,
and seems much longer
. length is everything in films
. if you can nail down the perfect timing
and pace
, you can win half the battle
. pleasantville can move at a good pace at times
,
but it is nto consistent enough
. overall
, pleasantville is a very plesant
and provocative departure from the predictability of most films these days
. i went in expecting a light
- hearted film baout change
. i left learning an important lesson about racism
and the way things change
. luckily
, pleasantville teaches this lesson in such a way to make it appeal to all audiences
. only if it could have done in a shorter amount of tiem
.
