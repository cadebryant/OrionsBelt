" which won the grand prize at the cannes film festival inthe 1989
, arguably began the resurgence of independent films
. made on a shoestring budget of
$ 1
. 2 million
, with
then relatively unknown actors
, it is a provocative
, thoroughly original drama
. hte film mostly focuses on the four central characters
, all in their lite 20 ' s
- early 30 ' s
. ann
( andie macdowell
)
, an unfulfilled housewife
, is marryied to john
( peter gallagher
)
, an insensitive lawyer
, who
, unbeknownst to her
, is haveing an affair with her younger sister
, cynthia
( laura san giacomo
)
. complicating matters even worse is graham
( james spader
, who won best actor at cannes
)
, john ' s old college buddy
, who comes to stay at their house
. ann is absolutely won over by him
, even
though she clearly has stated tyhat she has very little interest in sex
. that is the set
- up for the last hour of the picture
,
and since the film is entitled
,
" sex
, lies
,
and videotape
,
" it is best to keep the rest of the story developments at bay so that they will come as a genuin surprise
. director steven soderbergh has proven tothe be a wildly offbeat filmmaker
, ranging from the independent
, to the mainstream
( 1998 ' s
" out of sight
"
)
, to yhe downright kafkaesque
( 1997 ' s
" schizopolis
"
)
. he is yhe type of director who obviously takes a lot of chances
,
and believes in the work that he doens
,
and
,
" sex
, lies
,
and videotape
,
" is probably his most confident
,
anbd maybe even best
, to date
. the performances are superb from all four leads
,
but macdowell stands out in what is probably the main character
. she is always a very winning actress
,
bu this is probably her most three
- dimensional role that she has had
( with a close second being altman ' s 1993 mosaic
,
" short cuts
"
)
. the other parts are perfectly casted as well
, from spader ' s ominous graham
, to gallagher ' s self
- involved john
, to giacomo ' s outspoken cynthia
. the fianl act of the film
, especially
, comes right outloud of left field
,
and turns out to be both shocking
and oddly touching
,
and it would be criminal to give away the film ' s secrets
. suffice to say that
, through one powerful sequence
, ann is able to somewhat come out of her shell
,
and john learns a valuable lesson about honesty
, as well as deception
. the film hasnt one fault
,
however
. the characters are almost all emotionally cold
and isolated from oney another
,
and often unlikable
. if there had been a few extra scenes with gallagher
, it probably would have helped
, since his relationship with macdowell isn ' t qtuie as explored as i would have liked
.
" sex
, lies
,
and videotape
,
"
altough minorly flawed
, is still easily a brave
and adult motion picture that is far more mature
and honest about its subject matter than the usual film
. soderbergh clearly knew what he ws doing while he was making it
,
and the final product certainly proves this
.
