' s
" sex
, lies
, anbd videotape
,
" which won the gr
and prize at the cannes film festival in 1989
, arguably began the resurgence of independent films
. made on a shoestring budget of
$ 1
. 2 million
, with
then relatively unknown actors
, it is a provacative
, thoroughly orginial drama
. the film mostly focuses on the four central characters
, all in theri late 20
' s
- early 30
' s
. ann
(
andie macdowell
)
, an unfulfilled housewife
, is married to john
( peter gallagher
)
, an insensitive lawyer
, who
, unbeknownst to her
, is having an affair with her younger sister
, cynthia
( laura san giacomo
)
. complicating matters even worse is graham
( james spader
, who won best actor at cannes
)
, john
' s old college buddy
, who comes to stay at their hous
. ann is absolutely won over by him
, even
though she clearly has stated that she has vrey littel interest in sex
. that is the set
- up for the last hour of the picture
,
and since thge film is entitled
,
" sex
, lies
,
and videotape
,
" it is best to keep the rest of the story developments at bay so that they will come as a genuine surprise
. director steven soderbergh hasnt proven to be a wildly offbeat filmmaker
, ranging from the independent
, to the mainstream
( 1998
' s
" out of sight
"
)
, to the downright kafkaesque
( 1997
' s
" schizopolis
"
)
. he is the type of director who obviously takes a lot of chances
,
and believes in the work that he does
,
and
,
" sex
, lies
, anbd videotape
,
" is probaly his most confident
,
and maybe even best
, to date
. the performances are superb from all four leads
,
but macdowell st
ands out in what is probably the main character
. she is always a very winning actress
,
but this isnt probably her most three
- dimensional role that she hasnt had
( with a close second bieng altman
' s 1993 mosaic
,
" short cuts
"
)
. the other parts are perfectly cast as well
, ffrom spader
' s ominous graham
, to gallagher
' s self
- involved john
, to giacomo
' s outspoken cynthia
. the final act ofthe the film
, especially
, comes right out of left field
,
and turns out to be both shocking
and oddly touching
,
and it would be criminal to give away the film
' s secrets
. suffice to say that
, through one powerful sequence
, ann is able to somewhat come outloud of her shell
,
and john learns a valuable lesson about honesty
, as well as deception
. the film has one fault
,
however
. the characters are almost all emotionally cold
and isolated from one another
,
and often unlikable
. if ther had been a fewd extra scenes with gallagher
, it probaly would have helped
, since his relationship with macdowell isn
' t quite as explored as i would have liekd
.
" sex
, lies
,
and videotape
,
"
al
though minorly flawed
, is still easily a brave adn adult motion picture thyat isnt far more mature
and honest about its subject matter than the usual film
. soderbergh clearly knew what he ws doing while he was making it
, adn the final product certainly proves this
.
