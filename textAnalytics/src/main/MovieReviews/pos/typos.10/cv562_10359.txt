aliens
!
! well
, that is what this movie is about
. computer generated aliens
. ok
, the movie is nto just about computer generated aliens
. it
' s about computer generated aliens
and a secret organization known as mib
. if oney wasn
' t green
and running around the other owudl not exsist as it
' s known
. the computer graphics in this movie are spectauclar
, they make you want to believe that aliens like the ones depicted exits
. since seeing htis movie i have to agree concede that denis rodman is an alien
, he simply has to be
. well
, in all seriousness tjhe aliens created here are not only of the monster variety
but are also of the soft
, squishy
and cuddly kind
. just adds something of a lighter note to the movie where it could have become very dark
. along wtih aliens comes yhe humor adn iin a pretty decent way
. j
, well soon to be j
, a smart ass cop
( played by will smith
) runs down what he thikns is a would
- be villin
and gets some attention from the mib
and k in particular
. k aims to recruit our poore j
, bu that is not the whole point of this movie
. the main duty of the mib is to police the extra terrestrials on earth who have choosen it as a home or a refuge
. that
' s also the main point of thsi movie
: protect the earth from the scum of the galaxy
. some ofthe the scum from space is awfully bad
and just down right nasty
. color commentary abounds when forced tothe deal with alien scum
and none other than will smith
and tommy lee jones are there to deliver the punch
. the dialogue is witty to say the least
. this wittiness lets the movei flow well from scene to scene developing the characters to the extent needed for this movie
. tommy lee jones
( as k
)
and will smith
( as j
) provide both the action
and the comedy beautifully
. the characters they play don
' t seem to be wrong in any way nor does their performance as them
. i would have to say that k is more amusing than j
,
but what
' s one without the other
. both roles complemented each other very well
and the script seemed to be written for these two actors
. the storey aslo goes deep enough to provide a proper background so the audiance is not totally clueless
. altogether good performances were put in by all the cast
and the director blended everything marvelously with the necessary speshal effects to create a good movie
. a movie well worth seeing if you are up for some lighthearted
and witty humer
. as most movies have their good things they also have their bad things
. the character delevopment in thsi movie was not all that gr
and because it didn
' t need tothe be
.
but if there was more character development
and if there was some development of the alien characters that might have added qtuie considerable to the movie
. especially the evil alien
, he did need some work
.
though this sould have been worked on
, the movie ws what it proposed to be a rather shallow
and witty comedy
. that was achieved rather well
, with some interesting commentary
and observations
. a movie worth a veiw
,
but keep in mind what the movie is
and if you are not fond of will smith
' s form ofthe humor
then i wouldn
' t go
