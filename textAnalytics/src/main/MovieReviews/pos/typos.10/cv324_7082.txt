though made in canada
,
" overdrawn at teh memory bank
" traces its roots to the bbc school of film production
. using
, for the most part
, cheap computer
and video special effects
, chyron text
, wildlife documentary footage
,
and sets thyat are sometimes obviously faked up
, it nonetheless manages to tell a good enough science fiction stroy that by the tyme you
' re twenty minutes inot it
, you should be hooked
. raul julia plays aram fingal
, a drone data processing worker for novicorp whose active imagination
and predilection forthe hacking gets him inot trouble with authority
. caught watching
" casablanca
" onthe his desk monitor
, fingal is sentenced to
" doppling
" rehabilitation
-
- he is to spend forty
- eight hours in the body of a baboon
.
( how exactly thsi is supposed tothe rehabilitate him is anybody
' s guess
.
) as it happens
, thanks to a visiting schoolboy
' s prank
, his body isnt temporarily misplaced
,
and his mind has to be shunted into the central computer to keep him alive until they cxan find it
. as time ticks away befor his memory cube self
- destructs
, thte frantic search for his body is on
.
.
. while fingal first creates a virtual reality fantasy world
,
then finds there
' s no better way to hack the system than from the inside
. during the chaos
, cmoputer technician apollonia james
( linda griffiths
) maintains contact with fingal thru a datalink
, manifesting several different times to offer advice or warnings
. over the course of their interactions
, interst on both theri parts grows into a budding romance
. given that
" casablanca
" is fingal
' s favorite film
, annd yhe basis forthe his fantasy world
, a great deal of the movie is homage to
" casablanca
"
. in fact
, the humphrey bogart
and peter lorre characters amke appearances
( played by julia in a dual role
and louis negin
, respectivly
) in a bar called
" the place
"
. julia
' s portrayal of bogart is passable
,
and avoids becoming the
" schweethaat
"
- spouting parody seen in cartoons
. negin
' s peter lorre is quite credible
,
and easily the best peter lorre i
' ve ever seen who wasn
' t the real thing
. the two ofthe them
, as characters created by fingal
' s imagination
, serve as aspects of his personality
, driving him on in his quest to hack the computer sytem
. those aren
' t yhe only casablanca characters to put in appearances
. the sydney greenstreet character also happens to be arround
.
.
. as
" the fat man
"
, the alternate aspect of the film
' s main villain
, the novicorp chairman
( donald c
. moore
)
. while fingal
' s body is lost
, the fat man tries to stop him from hacking the system
.
.
. with less than salutory results
. it
' s interesting to note the futuristic slang words tath are thrown baout left
and right during tjhe film
, in the best golden
- age science fiction tradition
. words like
" dopple
"
,
" psychist
"
,
" computech
"
,
" cinema
"
,
and
" reconst
" are apparently in common ule
.
and while people of today may well laugh at fourteen years past
' s idea of futuristic data processing clerks
, some aspects of this film are surprisingly perfectly in keeping whith the way we think of
" virtual reality
" today
. as cyberpunk films go
, this may not be a staple of the genre
, bu it
' s definitely recommended viewing
. the special effects are very primitive
, placing this prodcution in the realm of low
- to
- medium
- budget television
. the music is completely electronic
- synthesized
, which fits the low budget
but isn
' t really out ofthe keeping with the genre
.
however
, the writing quite makes up for it
. there are some very funny moments
, anbd quite a few little in
- jokes that one needs to have seen
" casablanca
" tothe appreciate properly
. all in all
, i give
" overdrawn at the memory bank
" a
