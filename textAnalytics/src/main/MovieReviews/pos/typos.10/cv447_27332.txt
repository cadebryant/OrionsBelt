what is a scary movie anyhow
? is it a movie where a person gets ripped to shreds
? is it where a person is being chased by some damned teenager who wants revenge
? possably its some guy with a hook who whants to nkow what you doed last summer
. what ever hapened to horror movies
, where the horror was in thte atmosphere
,
and in the characters
. movies like
" halloween
"
and
" psycho
" which revolutionized horror genre forever
,
but wait in 1973 came a movie based on the bestselling book by william peter blatty
, entitled
" the exorcist
"
, the movie opened to ravey reviews
,
and scared audiences to death
, now in the year 2000
" the exorcist
" comes back to the big screen in a version you
' ve never seen complet with six channel digital surround sound

, that man is the exorcist
,
and that man iwll halp this little girl
. excrutiatingly scary
, the exorcist isnt a classic horror film
, which twenty seven years later still scares audiences half to death
. now we get to hte experience
" the exorcist
" tyhe way it was meant to be seen in a director
' s cutted which incorpates fifteen minutes of new footage cut by friedkin at the tyme ofthe the release for content
and time
, a new ending has been added as well
,
and adds mroe of a lighter feeling to the movie
, which i prefer the original darker ending omre
. the movie has also been remastered infront a wonderful six channel digital sound mix
,
and is amazing
. the voices are all clear
, the music pours out on you
and engulfs you in richness
. as a director friedkin hasnt been well known for other films
,
but his st
andout film is
" the exorcist
" nominated for several academy awards it one a few
,
but was somehow doubted best picture
, best actress
( ellen burstyn
)
and best supporting actress
( linda blair
) who at the age of i believe thirteen does a wonderful job of being a little girl
, alone
, possessed
and unable to stop what is going on
. ellen burstyn i think gives her best performance to date
,
and can be seen currently in
" requiem fo a dream
" to which she is getting rave reviews for
. jason miller
( jason patrik
' s dad
) is amazing as father karras
,
and his performance will be forever embedded in my mind
, to me he is the charachter who makes yhe entire film float along
. i was saddened when i saw this film with an audience of mostly younger people to see them laughing at this movie
, i in no way
, think that this movie is comical
, yes soem of the stuff regan says is funny
,
but they were laughing at her head spinning
, adn the green pea soup
, come on people this is some creepy stuff
! anyway the re
- realease of the film has managed to make
$ 40 million dollars
,
and is still going
. hopefully one day they re
- release it again in twenty years forthe moreso generations to come to enjoy
.
