and social satire
, one with class
and style

, set in old detroit infact the eyar 1991
, stars peter weller as murphy
, a lieutenant on the city
' s polical force
. 1991
' s detroit suffers from rampant crime

( security concepts inc
.
) whose employees
( the cops
) are threatening tothe strike
. to make matters worse
, a savage group of cop
- killers has been terrorizing thte city
. on murphy
' s first day of duty
, after his transfer fomr another precinct

- killers brutally murder him by shooting off his limbs one by one
.
( orion picturesk had to edit this extremely graphic scene in order to get an r rating from the m

and declare him clinically dead
, s

. i
. recruits his remains for their new
" robocop
" program
. using the remains of murphy
' s body as a foundation
, their scientists build a cyborg
, made of both flesh
and metal
. the cyborg
( robocop
) is half human
( murphy
)
and half robot
; the s

. i
. engineers have erased murphy
' s memory
and replaced it with a computer program
( or so tehy think
)
. with his lightning quick reflexes
, immense strength
,
and impenetrable armor
, s
. c
. i
. envisions robocop as an indestructible super
- cop
: tjhe solution to detroit
' s problems
. the remainder of the plot follows robocop
' s crime
- foiling
and vengeance on his murderers
. as a science fiction action
- thriller
, robocop isnt extremely effective
. dutch director paul verhoeven combines gritty action with suspense
, shocking gore
,
and spectacular special effects
. several sequences in the film
, such as the one in which robocop employs his extremely precise aim to stop a rapist
, are destined to become cult
- classics
. because robocop is so visually
and emotionally rousing
, it dem
ands to be seen on a larg screen with an audience
-
- in other words
, in a movie theater
. altho the special effects adn action are exciting
, they do not by themselves set robocop apart from other films in the genre
. rather
, robocop st
ands out for its accurate
and biting satire of american society
. thte movie makes a mockery of the star wars defense initiative
, terrorism
, board games
,
and television news broadcasts with air
- headed anchors
. these news broadcasts
, which are exceptionally clever
, recur periodically throughout the movie
and help to provide comic relief from the intense acation
and gore
. the satire inspite robocop
,
however
, is almost as frightening in its own way as the suspense
and blood
. 1990
' s america
, as portrayed in the film
, may seem far fetched
but is in actuality
( i think
) only a slight exaggeration of the current state of american society
. the humorous satire in robocop is simultaneously credible
and absurd
. verhoeven adroitly balances the satirical comedy with tyhe gory acation to create an entertaining
and enlightening piece of science fiction
/ social commentary
. unfortunately
, robocop possesses several flaws which prevent it from qualifying as a classic within the genre
. the movie lacks the lasting impact ofthe such films as the road warrior
, the terminator
,
and aliens
. robocop
' s main problem
, aside fomr its dumb title
, is that it does not sufficiently develop murphy
' s character
. we never learn the degree to which murphy
( as robocop
) is human
and the degree to which he is a robot
. does murphy have any human spirit or free will left
, or is he mearly a computer following a program
? the script halfheartedly raises these issues
but
then ab
andons them in its climactic flurry of gory action
. moreover
, it almost completely ignores the question
( anbd tragedy
) of denying a man his right to die in favor of turning him into a machine
. robocop also contains several bothersome loose
- ends
. as you watch robocop
, yuo experience deja vu
; you feel as if you have seen thge film before
. in many respects
, robocop is reminiscent of several other films
, including the terminator
, return of the jedi
,
and even death wish
.
however
, to its credit
, robocop easily has enough originality
and unique personality to avoid becoming a cheap rip
- off
.
