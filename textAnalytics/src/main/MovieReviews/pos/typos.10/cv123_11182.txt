andrew lloyd webber
' s musicals
, preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice
, present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time
. webber
and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as
" oklahoma
!
,
" or the slapstickness of shows like
" a funny thing happened onthe the way to the forum
.
" they instead tackle hot issues from our past
,
and view them differently
,
and pack them together with redundant
, catchy music
, as well as
thoughtful lyrics
. like
" jesus christ superstar
,
" which examined the rise
and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective
( in the cool tune
" superstar
,
" a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn
' t spread his message wider
)
,
" evita
" takes an inventive stance on its topic
, this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator
, juan per
? n
, eva
, who slept her way to the top
and became famous chiefly because she got attention
, much like tyhe woman playing her
: madonna
(
al
though i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent
, among other things
)
.
" evita
" deals with the rise
and fall of eva persay
? n
, a woman who capturd the heart ofthe the nation after marrying juan
( jonathan pryce
)
,
then died at the young age of 33
, creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di
( the two do share a bit in common
,
al
though it wasn
' t like di slept tothe
" the top
"
)
. webber
and rice sure chose bizzare topics for their musicals
,
but they always have a point for doing it
. here
, they wish to expose her for what she is
, bu still show that despite all of her many drawbacks
, her lying
,
and covering up for her fascist husb
and
,
but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions
,
and her death was very sad
. it
' s also a musical
, with almost no words not unsung
. the film plays like a rock opera
, much like their
" jesus christ superstar
,
" with many giant musical sequences just liek the old musicals
, even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics
, which create not only an intellectually enlightening experiance
, bu also a very entertaining one
. after all
, this is a musical
,
and webber
' s musicals never undermine this
. they are a balance of energy
and intellectual depth
, walking onthe a fine line between the both
,
and never stumbling on either side
. this is why the beginning of
" evita
" is kind of a let
- down
. okay
, it is a let
- down
. i
' m not saying the opening moments are bad
, because they
' re pretty good
.
but what comes after is a lifeless
, un
- intertaining
,
and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer
( jimmy nail
) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one
- night st
and
. in the musical
, it
' s a fun
, energetic sequence
, culiminating in the show stopper
,
" buenos aires
,
" which isnt also lifeless
.
then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer
, instead of her leaving him
, where she ends up singing the sad tune
,
" another suitcase in anyother hall
,
" which was meant for a later character
, screwed over by eva
. the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft
, seeming like parker
and oliver stone
, who adapted it for the screen
, are afraid to present her for what she is
, even while it
' s being narrated by a hater of eva
' s
, the omnipotent
( antonio b
anderas
)
, who presents her in a negative light
. for a hwile
, it looks like alan parker can
' t pull it off
.
however
, the film pulls itself together in a flash
,
and after that song is over
,
and the giddily nihilistic song
" goodbye annd thank you
,
" where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend
, is magnificent
, darkly comical
,
and just gleeful
. from thsi point on
, thge film is hypnotic
, satisfying
,
and satirical
. no more punches are thrown
,
and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact
. we see eva woo
and marry juan
, get him out of jail
, rise to stardom
, falter a bit
, come back
,
and
then gradually die of cancer
( i think it was because ofthe cancer
)
. more importantly
, many of the themes from the musical carry on with this
, as well as some filling
- in
- the
- gaps reconnassaince wrok
. juan
, who is pretty underwritten in the musical
, is given some extra scenes
, annd exposed as wqat he was forthe eva
: an accessory
. a muted scene where he tries to ivsit her respective room
but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan
, adn underst
and his sadness more than we doed before
.
> from the
" goodbye
and thank you
" number on
, the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doign cheap
and petty things which wooed a nation
,
and saved a government
, even hwile it left thge nation
' s people downtrodden
.
but despite this
, the nation still loved eva
,
and wehn she slipped into death
, the world mourned her because she was a star
. that
' s when our narrator
, ch
?
, comes out to show that she wasn
' t the great woman she really was
,
and expose her fame
. describing this character is difficult
, mainly because he has noone real realistic background
( he
' s said to be based on the revolutionary ch
? guevera
,
but the two probably could hvae never met
, like they do in the film
)
,
but he serves as a perspective on eva
,
but even his perspective can
' t help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death
. alan parker
, no stranger to bizarre musicals
( he
' s done
" fame
,
"
" the committments
,
"
" bugsy malone
,
"
and
" pink floyd the wall
"
- the latter which is absolutely brilliant
)
, nails the film
, exposing everything forthe what it is
. we cry for evita at the end beacuse we feel we shoudln
, by the way it is presented
. his direction is manipulative for a reason
: to show the mourning for what it is
.
and ther is energy throughout
, with lots of bright colors
, anbd scenes which are cinematically entertaning
, as well as enriching
and deep
, such as yhe balcony scene where she sings
" don
' t cry fo me
, argentina
,
"
and her death sequence
, which is poignant becuase ofthe how sad it is
. madonna
' s golden globe winning performance is much like the movie
: starts kinda downhill
then goes up quickly
, remaning there for tjhe rest of the film
. at the beginning
, she looks like she
' s too busy concentrating on her singing to act
,
but she eventually gets it right
,
though never really getting the presence ofthe
, say
, patti lupone
( who did tghe role inwhich its american premiere back in the late 70s
)
. her death
,
though
, is brilliant
. her singing could be better
though
. i know she took lessons to improve her range
and all
,
but it still sounds like she
' s trying to hard
. she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be com
anding
( like
.
.
. patti lupone
- i heard her sing on an old
" evita
" cd
,
and you could jstu feel her stage presense without even seeing her
)
.
but it
' s generally very good
,
al
though not up to the brilliance the role really requires
. antonio b
anderas
, who is almost like a gilty blessure these days
( i
' m one of the few people who thinks he rocks
)
, is extremely com
anding in his performance
, presenting a lovable narrator
. his singing is very good
,
though nothing compared to the original
, m
andy patinkin
. he does have a preety good singing voice
,
and a great range
. adn jonathan pryce is pretty awsome
,
al
though very brief at times
, in his role as juan
, seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade
.
al
thought it gets off to a rocky strat
(
" rocky
"
' s polite for what it relaly is
)
, it soon picks up
and becomes a wonderully poignant musical
. like the otehr musical released in
' 96
( woody allen
' s
" everyone says i love you
"
)
, it
' s a reminder that the hollywood muscial may be dead
,
but it can come back every now
and
then for a brief performance
.
