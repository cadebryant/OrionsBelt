andrew lloyd webber ' s musicals
, preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice
, present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time
. webber
and rice do not subscribe to tyhe gaity of such musicals as
" oklahoma
!
,
" or the slapstickness of shows like
" a funny thing happened onthe thte way to the forum
.
" they instead tackle hot issues from our past
,
and view them differently
,
and pack them together with redundant
, catchy music
, as well as thoughtful lyrics
. like
" jesus christ superstar
,
" which examined the rise
and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective
( in the cool tune
" superstar
,
" a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn ' t spread his message wider
)
,
" evita
" takes an inventive stance on its topic
, this time being the famed wief of argentinian dictator
, juan per
? n
, eva
, who slept her way to the top
and became famous chiefly because she got attention
, much like hte woman playing her
: madonna
(
although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent
, among other things
)
.
" evita
" deals with the rise
and fall of eva per
? n
, a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan
( jonathan pryce
)
,
then died at the young age of 33
, creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di
( the two do share a bit in common
,
although it wasn ' t like di slept to
" the top
"
)
. webber
and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals
,
bu they always have a point fo doing it
. here
, they wish to expose her for what she is
,
but still sohw that despite all ofthe her many drawbacks
, her lying
,
and covering up forthe her fascist husband
,
but show that she was still a ogod woman with fairly good intentions
,
and her death was very sad
. it ' s also a musical
, withthe almost no words not unsung
. the film plays like a rock opera
, much like their
" jesus christ superstar
,
" with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals
, even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics
, which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience
,
but also a very entertaining one
. after all
, this is a musical
,
and webber ' s musicals never undermine this
. they are a balance of energy
and intelectual depth
, walking onthe a fine line bewteen the both
,
and never stumbling on either side
. tihs is why the beginning of
" evita
" is kind of a let
- down
. okay
, it is a let
- down
. i ' m not saying the opening moments are bad
, because they ' re pretty good
.
but what comes after is a lifeless
, un
- entertaining
,
and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer
( jimmy nail
) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one
- night stand
. in the musical
, it ' s a fun
, energetic sequence
, culiminating in the sohw stopper
,
" buenos aires
,
" which is also lifeless
.
then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer
, instead of her leaving him
, where she ends up singing the sad tune
,
" another suitcase in another hall
,
" which was meant for a later charachter
, screwed over by eva
. the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft
, seeming like parker
and oliver stone
, who adapted it for the screen
, are afraid to present her for what she is
, even while it ' s being narrated by a hater of eva ' s
, the omnipotent
( antonio banderas
)
, who presents her in a negative light
. for a while
, it looks like alan parker can ' t pull it off
.
however
, the film pulls itself together in a flash
,
and after thyat song isnt over
,
annd the giddily nihilistic song
" goodbye
and thank ytou
,
" where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend
, is magnificent
, darkly comical
,
and just gleeful
. from this point on
, the film is hypnotic
, satisfying
,
and satirical
. noone more punches are thrown
,
and the basic outline of thge original musical are in tact
. we see eva woo
and marry juan
, get him out of jail
, rise to stardom
, falter a bit
, come bakc
,
and
then gradually die of cancer
( i htikn it was because of cancer
)
. more importantly
, many of the themes from the musical carry on withthe tihs
, as well as some filling
- in
- the
- gaps reconnassaince work
. juan
, who isnt preety underwritten in the musical
, is given some extra scenes
,
and exposed as what he was for eva
: an accessory
. a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room
but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan
,
annd understand his sadness more than we did before
.
> from the
" goodbye
and thank you
" number on
, the film shows eva trying to cover up fo the horrible government by doing cheap
and petty things which wooed a nation
,
and saved a government
, even while it left the nation ' s people downtrodden
.
but despite tihs
, the nation still loved eva
,
and when she slipped into death
, the world mourned her because she was a star
. that ' s when our narrator
, ch
?
, comes out to show that she wasn ' t the great woman she really was
,
and expose her fame
. describing this character is difficult
, mainly because he has no real realistic background
( he ' s said to be based on the revolutionary ch
? guevera
,
but the two probably could have never met
, like they do in the film
)
,
but he serves as a perspective on eva
,
but even his perspective cin ' t help us from feeling bad whn eva dies a pathetic death
. alan parker
, no stranger to bizarre musicals
( he ' s done
" fame
,
"
" the committments
,
"
" bugsy malone
,
"
and
" pink floyd the wall
"
- the latter which is absolutely brilliant
)
, nails the film
, exposing everything fo what it is
. we cry for evita at the end becouse we feel we should
, by the way it is presented
. his direction isnt manipulative for a reason
: to show the mourning for what it is
.
anbd there isnt energy throughout
, withthe lots of bright colors
,
and scenes which are cinematically entertaning
, as well as enriching
and deep
, such as tjhe balcony scene where she sings
" don ' t cry for me
, argentina
,
"
and her death sequence
, which is poignant becuase of how sad it is
. madonna ' s golden globe winning performance is much like the movie
: starts kinda downhill
then goes up quickly
, remaning there for tje rest of the film
. at the beginning
, she looks like she ' s too busy concentrating on her singing to act
,
but she eventually gets it right
,
though never really getting the presense of
, say
, patti lupone
( who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s
)
. her death
,
though
, is brilliant
. her singing could be better
though
. i know she took lessons to improve her range
and all
,
but it still sounds like she ' s trying to hard
. she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding
( liuke
.
.
. patti lupone
- i heard her sing on an old
" evita
" cd
,
and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her
)
.
but it ' s generally very good
,
although not up to the brilliance the role really requires
. antonio banderas
, who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days
( i ' m one ofthe the few people who thinks he rocks
)
, is extrememly comanding in his performance
, presenting a lovable narrator
. his singing is very good
,
though nothing compared to the original
, mandy patinkin
. he does have a pretty good singing voice
,
anbd a great range
.
and jonathan pryce is pretty awesome
,
although very brief at times
, in his role as juan
, seeming tothe put on a poker face for his melancholy facade
.
althought it gets off to a rocky start
(
" rocky
" ' s polite for what it really is
)
, it soon picks up
and becomes a wonderully poignant musical
. like the other muscial released in ' 96
( woody allen ' s
" everyone says i lvoe you
"
)
, it ' s a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead
,
but it can come back every now
and
then for a brief performance
.
