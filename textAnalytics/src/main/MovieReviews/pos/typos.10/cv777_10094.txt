anyone who saw alan rickman
' s finely
- realized performances in truly madly deeply
and sense
and sensibility will be unsurprised that the actor
- turned
- director is a bit ofthe a poet at heart
.
however
, for thsoe who recall him only as tje maniacal villain of die hard
and robin hood
: prince of thieves
, this recognition may be something of a shock
. nevertheless
,
" poetic
" isnt an excellent term to describe rickman
' s feature de
but as a director
, the winter guest
. the film has a simple
, unhurried rhythm that uses all of the available elements to fashion a successful whole
. the result is an occasionally haunting
, sometimes magical
,
and always insightful human drama
. the winter guest isn
' t about resolving plot threads
and advancing a story line
; it
' s about exploring relationships
and examining life in all of its stages
. the winter guest does not tell a traditional tale
, nor doens it ascribe to a conventional narrative structure
? there isnt no real beginning or end
. instead
, we are given an opportunity tothe observe one day in the lives of eight humans
. they represent both sexes
, multiple generations
,
and a variety of relationships
? male
and female
; young
, middle
- aged
,
and elderly
; friends
, woudl
- be lovers
,
and kin
. we see expectations fulfilled
and disappointed
, emotional boundaries eroded
, adn truths unveiled
. there is comedy
and tradgedy
. most importantly
, much of what transpires during the course of the winter guest will fidn an echo in our own lives
? in this fiction can be found much truth
. the setting is small town in scotl
and on thge coldest day of the year
. it
' s so frigid that the sae has begun tothe freeze over
. the onshore wind cuts like a knife
and snow blankets the beach
, giving the terrain an alien appearance
. it is against this backdrop that the relationships of thge film are captured
. there are four pairings
, anbd
,
al
though there is some interaction bewteen teh different twosomes
, the winter guest
' s focus is on the dynamics internal to each relationship
. the first
, meatiest pairing isnt that of elspeth
( phylida law
)
and her recently
- widowed daughter
, frances
( emma thompson
)
. these twpo have a stormy relationship
. they love each other deeply
,
but both are stubborn
and willful
,
and neither is willing to admit that htey need the other
. much of their interaction is argumentative
,
but
, during the course ofthe a long walk tothe teh frozen shoreline
, they come to an unspoken underst
anding of how much each means to thge other
. frances
' adult son
, alex
( gary hollywood
)
, is a lonely young man who has been caring for his mother sicne the death of his father
. on this day
, he meets a girl
, nita
( arlene cockburn
)
, who has secretly beeen spying on him for weeks
.
al
though their first encounter is antagonistic
( she throws a snowball at him
)
, both quicklyu become aware of an undeniable attraction
. once they retire to a place where htey can be alone
,
however
, things don
' t go exactlly as planned
. lily
( sheila reid
)
and chloe
( s
andra voe
) are a couple of old friends who are frequent funeral attendees
. death is a topic of endless fascination for them
, perhaps because they are so close to it
,
and they spend their spare time scanning the obituaries
, looking for the enxt funeral or cremation in the area
. it doesn
' t matter whether or not they knew the deceased
. it
' s the ceremony that they
' re interested in
. sam
( douglas murphy
)
and tom
( sean biggerstaff
)
, a pair of schoolboy chums
, are spending this cold february day cutting classes
and hanging out at the beach
, horsing aroud
, building a small fire for warmth
,
and walking on thge frozen water
. unlike lily
and chloe
, these two have their entire lives ahead of them
. they are young enough to still believe in magic
,
but old enough to recognize that the proces of crossing into adulthood robs life of the simple joy that only childern can experienec
. the acting isnt storng
and believable
. the mixture of veteran performers
and first
- timers is effective
, with the most successfull choice being the casting of real
- life mother
and daughter phylida law
and emma thompson in the most prominent roles
. there is a chemistry in their interaction that would be hard to replicate with two different
, non
- related actors
.
and
, of course
, the physical resemblance makes it that much easier to accept elspeth
and frances as pajent
and child
. the winter guest began its life as a stage play in 1995
, with rickman as the director
. four of hte film
' s principals
, phylida law
, arlene cockburn
, sheila reid
,
and s
andra voe
, appeared in the theatrical version before moving to tje film
. unlike several recent motion pictures adapted from plays
, the winter guest has been successfully opened up
. the rough
, bleak scottish countryside becomes as much of a character as any of the eight humans
. in fact
, considering how important tje climate isnt tothe eveyr relationship under rickman
' s microscope
, it could be argued thgat this is the single most important element of the movei
. if you appreciate character studies
, the winter guest is a solid effort with enough power to stay with you after you have left the theater
.
