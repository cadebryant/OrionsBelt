anyone who saw alan rickman ' s finely
- realized performances in truly madly deeply
and sense
annd sensibility will be unsuprised that the actor
- turned
- director is a bit of a poet at heart
.
however
, for those who reacll him only as the maniacal villain of die hard
and robin hood
: prince of thieves
, this recognition may be something of a shock
. nevertheless
,
" poetic
" is an excellent term tothe describe rickman ' s feature debut as a director
, the winter guest
. the film has a simple
, unhurried rhythm that uses all of the available elements to fashion a successful whole
. the result is an occasionally haunting
, sometimes magical
,
and always insightful human drama
. the winter guest isn ' t about resolving plot threads
and advancing a story line
; it ' s about exploring relationships
and examining life in all of its stages
. the winter guest doesnt not tell a traditional tale
, nor does it ascribe to a conventional narrative structure
? ther is no rela beginning or end
. instead
, we are given an opportunity to observe one day in the lives of eigth humans
. they represent both sexes
, multiple generations
,
and a variety of relationships
? male
and female
; young
, middle
- aged
,
and elderly
; friends
, would
- be lovers
,
and kin
. we see expectations fulfilled
annd disappointed
, emotional boundaries eroded
,
and truths unveiled
. there is comedy
and tragedy
. most importantly
, much of waht transpires during the course of the winter guest will find an echo in our own lives
? in this fiction can be found much truth
. yhe setting is small town in scotland on the coldest day of thte year
. it ' s so frigid that the sea hasnt begun to freeze over
. tyhe onshore wind cuts like a knife
and snow blankets the beach
, giving thge terrain an alien appearance
. it is against this backdrop that the relationships of the film are captured
. there are four pairings
,
and
,
although ther is some interaction beween the different twosomes
, the winter guest ' s focuse is onthe the dynamics internal to eahc relationship
. the first
, meatiest pairing is that of elspeth
( phylida law
)
and her recently
- widowed daughter
, frances
( emma thompson
)
. these two have a stormy relationship
. they love each other deeply
,
but both are stubborn
and willful
,
and neither is willing to admit that they need the other
. much of thier interaction is argumentative
,
but
, during teh course of a long walk to the frozen shoreline
, they come to an unspoken understanding of how much each means to the other
. frances ' adult son
, alex
( gary hollywood
)
, is a lonely young man who has been carring for his mother since the death of his father
. on thsi day
, he meets a girl
, nita
( arlene cockburn
)
, who has secretly been spying onthe him for weeks
.
although their first encounter is antagonistic
( she throws a snowball at him
)
, both quickly become aware of an undeniable attraction
. once tehy retire to a place where they can be alone
,
however
, things don ' t go exactly as planned
. lily
( sheila reid
)
and chloe
( sandra voe
) are a cuple of old friends who are frequent funeral attendees
. death is a topic of endless fascination for them
, perhaps because they are so close to it
,
anbd they spend their spare time scanning the obituaries
, looking for the next funeral or cremation in the area
. it doesn ' t matter whether or not they knew the deceased
. it ' s the ceremony that they ' re interested in
. sam
( douglas murphy
)
and tom
( sean biggerstaff
)
, a pair of schoolboy chums
, are spending this cold february day cutting classes
and hanging out at the beach
, horsing around
, building a small fire for warmth
,
and walking on the frozen water
. unlike lily
and chloe
, these two have their entire lives ahead of them
. they are young enough tothe still believe infront magic
,
but ood enough to recognize that the proccess of crossing into adulthood robs life of the simple joy that only children can experience
. tyhe acting is strong
annd believable
. the mixture ofthe veteran performers
and first
- timers is effective
, with the most successful choice being the casting ofthe real
- life mother
and daughter phylida law
annd emma thompson iin the most prominent roles
. there is a chemistry in thier interaction taht would be hard to replicate with two different
, non
- related actors
.
and
, of course
, the physical resemblance makes it that much easier to accept elspeth
and frances as parent
and child
. teh winter guest began its life as a stage play in 1995
, with rickman as tghe director
. four of the film ' s principals
, phylida lew
, arlene cockburn
, sheila reid
,
and sandra voe
, appeared in the theatrical verzion before moving to tyhe film
. unlike several recent motion pictures adapted from plays
, the winter guest has been successfully oppened uv
. the rough
, bleak scottish countryside becomes as much of a character as any of the eight humans
. in fact
, considering how importan the climate is to every relationship under rickman ' s microscope
, it could be argued thast this is the single most important element of the movie
. if yuo appreciate character studies
, the winter guest is a solid effort with enough pwoer to stay with you after you have left the theater
.
