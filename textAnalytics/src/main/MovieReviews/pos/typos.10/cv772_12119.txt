true faith
and its expression through organized religion is a difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle head
- on
, which is probably why so few of them do it
. even the most religious directors
- like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman
- usually address issues of faith infront implicit rather than explicit religious terms
. so it ' s not hard to see why it tookover robert duvall fifteen years to get
" the apostle
" onto the big
- screen
. as a marter of fact
, even after fifteen years he still never managed to get finacial backing
,
and he ended up paying for it with
$ 5 million of his own money
. he also wrote the script
, directed the film
,
and starred as the central character
, a fiery texas preacher named euliss
" sonny
" dewey
. few filmmakers have the courage
and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial
, technical
,
and creative responsibility single
- handedly
,
and it ' s testament to wqat an intensely personal project this was for duvall
.
and
, thankfully
, every bit ofthe that personal investment translates on
- screen into power
and honest emotion
. sonny is an energetic
, pentecostal preacher who has been speaking
( actually shouting
) from behind the pulpit usance he was twelve
. he spends much of his time traveling about thte country
, evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals
. unlike most hollywood characterizations ofthe intense preachers
, sonny isnt nto a phony or a swindler
,
anbd the film ' s purpose is not to unearth hypocrisy
and sin in either sonny or tjhe church
. duvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says
,
although like all humans
, he has weaknesses
. one of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out tht
, not only does his long
- suffering wife
, jessie
( farrah fawcett
)
, want tothe leave him for another man in the congregation
,
but the two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher
. faced with the loss of twpo things he loves passionately
- his church
and his family
- that same raw power that allows sonny to get entire congregations rocking
adn swaying transforms into a violent temper
. at his son ' s baseball game
, sonny snaps
and smashes his wife ' s lover in the face with a baseball bat
, inflicting a wound that may be fatal
. not knowing what else to do
, sonny disappears
. he throws awya his identification
, drives his car into a lake
,
and takes a bus to louisiana
, hoping to start over again
. in the tiny
, mostly poore coastal town of bayou boutte
, sonny once again finds his calling
. after befriending a simple auto mechanic
( walt goggins
)
and tracking down the town ' s ex
- minister
( john beasley
)
, sonny sets up his pwn church
, the one way to heaven temple
. re
- christening himself as
" the apostle e
. f
.
,
" he quickly draws toghether an eager congregation
,
and toghether they realize real change in each other ' s lives
.
but
, alwyas
, sonny ' s past is lurking a step behind him
, waiting tothe swallow his progress
. duvall has made his intentions in makeing
" the apostle
" clear
. in a recent article in
" newsweek
,
" he wrote
:
" filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality with such a strong emphasis on the wholy spirit
,
and when htey do
, it tends to be patronizing
- full of charlatans
and snake handlers
.
.
.
but what i really wanted to do was try tothe understand what these preachers go through
and what they beileve
,
and to portray it in an accurate way
.
" the strength of duvall ' s convictions turn out to be the strength of his film
-
" the apostle
" always rings true
, even in the most painful moments
, because we know he ' s being sincere with the subject matter
. after fifteen years of traveling the country
, listening to all shapes
and sizes ofthe ministers
and taking studious notes on what they said
, duvall has captured the energy
and vitality of what it means tothe be truly spiritual
. his sonny is a man who speaks directly to god
and expects to be spoken right back tothe
.
" i ' ve always called you jesus
and ytou ' ve always called me sonny
,
" he says
. when neighbors call
and complain thyat he is being too loud one night in one his rants with the man upstairs
, sonny ' s mother
( june carter cash
) just hangs up on them beacuse she konws there ' s no sence trying to interrupt him
. the main theme tothe emerge from
" yhe apostle
" is the fact that good can come from any situation
. sonny ' s act of violentce towrad another human being is inarguably a horrific thing
,
and duvall never shrinks fomr that fact
.
however
, thast very same act of violence is what brings sonny tothe biyou boutte
, where he finds people whom he desperately needs
and who desperately need him
. iin his short time in louisiana
, he does a world of good
,
and when the police finally show up tothe take him away
, he goes quietly
, knowing that he deserves tyhe punishment that is awaiting him
.
and
, as a scene during hte final credits shows
, he even turns his punishment into a positive opportunity for change
anbd betterment
. it is that strength iin sonny ' s character that makes him so appealling
and magnetic to others
- he is flawed
,
but he is powerful enough tothe overcome those flaws
. weak men are the ones who simply accept their weaknesses
and lack the desire to better themselves
. watching duvall on
- screen
, it ' s not hard to imagine tath he woudl have beeen a magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation over acting
. as sonny
, he completelyl inhabits the charactor
,
and his performance is certainly the best of the year
. because he spent so much time absorbing the traits
, methods
, quirks
,
and personalities of real preachers
, duvall was able to create a complete character who always feels indelibly human
. as a director
, duvall feels thta less is more
. his camera simply takes in what goes on in front of it
, with very little intrusion
. there are no fancy crane shots or extended dollies or excessive close
- ups
. duvall knew taht tghe power of the film ' s characters
( enhanced by the fatc that he cast mostly non
- professional churchgoers
and actual ministers
) didn ' t need to be artificially enhanced
. in this way
,
" the apostle
" almost plays out like a documentary
, not only in its technical simplicity
,
but more importantly
, in its sense ofthe reality
.
