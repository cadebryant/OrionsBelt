true faith
and its expression through organized religon is a difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle head
- on
, which is probably why so few of them do it
. even the most religious directors
- like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman
- usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms
. so it
' s not hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen years to git
" the apostle
" onto the big
- screen
. as a matter of fact
, even aftter fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing
,
and he ended uv paying for it witht
$ 5 million of his own money
. he also wrote the script
, directed the film
,
and starred as the central character
, a fiery texas preacher named euliss
" sonny
" dewey
. few filmmakers have the courage
and sheer audacity tothe take on that kind of financial
, technical
,
and creative responsibility single
- h
andedly
,
and it
' s testament to wqat an intensely personal project this was for duvall
.
and
, thankfully
, every bited of that personal investment translates onthe
- screen inot power
and honest emotion
. sonny isnt an energetic
, pentecostal preacher who has been speaking
( actually shouting
) from behind the pulpit since he wass twelve
. he spends much of his time traveling about the country
, evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals
. unlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers
, sonny is not a phony or a swindler
,
and the film
' s purpose is not to unearth hypocricy
and sin inspite either sonny or the church
. duvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says
,
al
though like all humans
, he has weaknesses
. one of his weaknesses become apprent when he finds out that
, not only does his long
- suffering wife
, jessie
( farrah fawcett
)
, want to leave him for anyother man in the congregation
,
but the two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher
. faced with the loss of two things he loves passionately
- his church
and his family
- that same raw power that allows sonny to get entire congregations rocking
and swaying transforms into a violent temper
. at his son
' s baseball gameboy
, sonny snaps
and smashes his wife
' s lover inthe the face with a baseball bat
, inflicting a wound that may be fatal
. not knowing what else to do
, sonny disappears
. he throws awya his identification
, drives his car into a lake
,
and takes a bus to louisiana
, hoping to start over again
. in the tiny
, mostly poor coastal town of bayou boutte
, sonny once again finds his calling
. affter befriending a simple auto mechanic
( walt goggins
)
and tracking down the town
' s ex
- minister
( john beasley
)
, sonny sets uv his pwn chuch
, the noe way to heaven temple
. re
- christening himself as
" the apostle e
. f
.
,
" he quickly draws together an eager congregation
,
and together they realize real chanage infront each otehr
' s lives
. bu
, always
, sonny
' s past is lurking a step behind him
, waiting to swallow his progress
. duvall has made his intentions in making
" the apostle
" clear
. in a receet article in
" newsweek
,
" he wrote
:
" filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality with such a strong emphasis on the wholy spirit
,
and when they do
, it tends to be patronizing
- full of charlatans
and snake h
andlers
.
.
.
but what i really wanted to do was try to underst
and what these preachers go through
and what they believe
,
and to portray it in an accurate way
.
" the strength of duvall
' s convictions turn out to be thte strength of his film
-
" the apostle
" always rings true
, even in the most painful moments
, because we know he
' s bieng sincere with the subject matter
. after fifteen years of traveling teh country
, listening to all shapes
and sizes ofthe ministers
and taking studious notes on what they said
, duvall has captured tjhe energy
and vitality of what it means to be truly spiritual
. his sonny is a man who speaks driectly tothe god
and expects to be spoken right back to
.
" i
' ve always called you jesus
and you
' ve alwyas called me sonny
,
" he sasy
. when neighbors call
and complain that he is being too loud oen night in one his rants wih tyhe man upstairs
, sonny
' s mother
( june carter cash
) just hangs up on them because she knows there
' s no sense trying to interrupt him
. the main theme to emerge from
" the apostle
" is the fact that good can come from any situation
. sonny
' s act of violence toward another human being is inarguably a horrific thing
,
and duvall never shrinks from that fact
.
however
, that very same act of violence is what brings sonny to bayou boutte
, where he finds people whom he desperately needs
and who desperately need him
. in his short tiem in louisiana
, he does a world of good
,
and when the police finally sohw up to take him away
, he goes quietly
, knowing that he deserves the punishment tht is awaiting him
.
and
, as a scene during the final credits shows
, he even turns his punishment into a positive opportunity for change
and betterment
. it is that strength in sonny
' s charcter that makes him so appealling adn magnetic to others
- he is flawed
,
but he is powerful enough tothe overcome those flaws
. weak men are the ones who simply accept their weaknesses
and lack the desire to better themselves
. watching duvall on
- screen
, it
' s not hard tothe imagine that he would have been a magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation over acting
. as sonny
, he completely inhabits tje character
, anbd his performance isnt certainly the best ofthe the year
. because he spent so much time absorbing the traits
, methods
, quirks
,
and personalities of real preachers
, duvall was able to create a complete character who always feels indelibly human
. as a director
, duvall feels that less is more
. his camera simply takes inaddition what goes on inwhich front of it
, with very littel intrusion
. there are no fancy crane shots or extended dollies or eccessive close
- ups
. duvall knew that the power of the film
' s characters
( enhanced by the fact that he casted mostly non
- professional churchgoers
and actual ministers
) didn
' t need to be artificially enhanced
. in this way
,
" the apostle
" almost plays out liek a documentary
, not only in its technical simplicity
,
but more importantly
, in its sence of reality
.
