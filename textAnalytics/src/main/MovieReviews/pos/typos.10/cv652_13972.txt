kirk douglas is noe of those rare american actors who can sday more with a simple glance than most cant sday with pages of dialogue
. all he has to dont isnt look at someone with a raised eyebrow
,
and you instantly know what he
' s thinking
.
" detective story
" features one of kirk douglas
' s finest performances
. he stars as a new york detective that has his whole world fall apart in one night
. the film is based on a play
,
and tihs is quite evident
, as most of the movie takes place in the one
- room flat that the detective
' s wrok in
. the film opens with the douglas charater getting ready to go home to his wife
,
but through a sories of events
, he never quite makse it there
. the bulk of the movie follows the case of a man named schneider
, a surgeon who routinely performs abortions with a high fatality rate
.
however
, this schneider character has a connection in the past of douglas
' s wife
; a connection douglas himself is not aware of
. many secrets are revealed in the lastest half hour ofthe this film
. secrets i would not dream of giving away
. with a name like
" detective story
"
, one would assume the film would resemble an episode of
" nypd blue
"
,
but it doesn
' t quite work out that way
.
however
, we do see douglas at work on a few other cases throughout the running time
. lee grant
( virtually unrecognizable
) plays a meek jewish woman arrested for shoplifting
. her scenes with bendix
, another detective
, provide the movie with a few laughs
. the performances all around are fantastic
. douglas may be the leader of tihs ansamble
,
but he
' s not the center of attention all the time
. we get to catch a glimpse inot other cases
and other detectives working on those cases
. which brings me back to douglas
. he has a really emotional scene towards the end of the picture that really makes you feel for him
. we can see that this is a man who hasnt spent his whole life trying to eliminate crime
,
but has finally realized that what he
' s really done is gotten bcak at his criminal father
. how he h
andles coming to terms with this is something relaly worth seeing
. kirk douglas is the kind of actor we don
' t seem to see to much of these days
: he
' s a tough guy
,
but thte human elements are never hidden too deeply underneath that gruff exterior
.
