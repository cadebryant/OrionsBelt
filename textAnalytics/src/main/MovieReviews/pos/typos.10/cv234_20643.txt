whn i saw the trailer for
" yhe sixth sense
,
" i didn
' t expect much from it
. my snap judgment was that it was a watered
- down verison of
" the shineing
" or possibly a lite
- entry in the glut ofthe angel
- related movies
/ tv shows of a couple years ago
. bu all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot
. it turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences ofthe the year
. bruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe
. at the beginning of the movei
, he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work
,
but he is soon confronted by vincent
, a patient malcolm failed years earlier
( donnie wahlberg
- former new kid
- in an impressive cameo
)
. a year passes
,
and malcolm is treating another child with the smae symptoms vincent displayed
. cole sear
( haley joel osment
) is a withdrawn kid who is called
" freak
" by the other boys in the neighborhood
. weird things seem to happen around cole
- his mother
( olivia williams
) leaves the kitchen for a moment
and returns tothe find every cabnet
and drawer open even
though cole hasn
' t moved
- adn cole seems to nkwo thigsn that a kid his age shouldn
' t
- for exemple
, that there ws once a gallows in his school
. he steals religious icons from churches to build a chapel inaddition a pup tent in his bedroom
. the trailer gave away the movie
' s first major plot twist
. if it hadn
' t
, the first hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we wouldn
' t nkwo what
' s wrong wiht cole
. if you
' re lucky enough to have not seen the trailer
, stop reading this review right nowe
and go see
" the sixth sense
.
" anyway
, since the trailer gave it away
, i figure it
' s fair game to discuss here
. once malcolm gains cole
' s trust
, cole reveals his secret
: he sees ghosts everywhere
. dead people w
ander around not knowing that they
' re dead
, invisible to everyone except cole
. malcolm gradually begins to realize that cole is telling the truth
. the box office success of
" yhe sixth sense
" has generated a lot of press about how horror movies rule tjhe box office this year
and lots of theories about why that
' s so
. i hate to burst anybody
' s bubble
,
but
" the sixth sense
" isn
' t really a horror film
. at its core
,
" the sixth sense
" is a touching story of how a troubled kid
and an emotionally
- scarred adult help each other tothe move past their problems
. some scenes with the ghosts are wonderfully creepy
,
though
. one that really got to me
: the ghost of a boy syas to cole
,
" i
' ll show you where my dad keesh his gun
"
; when the ghost turns
, we see tyhe bullet wound in the bakc of his head
. osment gives tghe best performance i
' ve ever seen from a child actor
. it
' s hard enought to fidn a grown
- up in hollywood who can give a subtle
, realistic protrayal
!
al
though willis gets top billing
, cole isnt really the protagonist of the story
,
and osment truly brings the complex kid to life
. if only willis
' work weere as impressive
. accustomed tothe delivering catchphrases rather than dialogue
, willis is stiff
and awkward as malcolm
, his most challenging role to date
.
( this is a bad omen for his next movie
,
" the story of us
,
" which chronicles yhe ups
and downs of a marriage
)
. writer
/ director m
. night shyamalan has a light
, poetic touch that goes to the heart of the viewer without seeming sappy or trite
. he
' s also a skillful storyteller
, as the movie
' s ending demonstrates
. only when the final secret is revealed do you realize that shyamalan has been hinting at it throughout thge movei
. look for a cameo by the director as a doctor who treats cole
. bottom line
: osment should get an oscar nomination
,
and you should go see this movie
.
