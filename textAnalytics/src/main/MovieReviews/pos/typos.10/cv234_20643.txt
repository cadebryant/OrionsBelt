when i saw the trailer fo
" the sixth sence
,
" i didn ' t expect much from it
. my snap judgement was that it was a watered
- down version of
" the shineing
" or possibly a late
- entry in the glut of angel
- related movies
/ tv shows of a couple eyasr ago
.
but all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot
. it turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the yearm
. bruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe
. at tghe beginning of the movie
, he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work
,
bu he is soon confronted by vincent
, a patient malcolm failed years earlier
( donnie wahlberg
- fromer new kid
- in an impressive cameo
)
. a year passes
,
and malcom is treating another child with the same sypmtoms vincent displayed
. cole sear
( haley joel osment
) is a withdrawn kid who is called
" freak
" by the other boys in the neighborhood
. weird things seem to happen around cole
- his mother
( olivia williams
) leaves the kichen for a moment
and returns to find every cabinet
and drawer open even
though cole hasn ' t moved
-
and cole seems to know things that a kid his age shouldn ' t
- for example
, that there was once a gallows in his school
. he steals religious icons from churches to build a chapel in a pup tent in his bedroom
. the trailer gave away the movie ' s first major plot twist
. if it hadn ' t
, the first hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we wouldn ' t know what ' s wrong with cole
. if you ' re lucky enought to have nto seen the trailer
, stop reading this review right now
and go see
" the sixth sense
.
" anyway
, since the trailer gavey it away
, i figure it ' s fair game to discuss here
. once malcolm gains cole ' s trust
, cole reveals his secret
: he sees ghosts everywhere
. dead people wander around not knowing that they ' re dead
, inisible to everyone except cole
. malcolm gradually begins to realize that cole is telling the truth
. the box office success of
" the sixth sense
" has generated a lot of press baout how horror movies rule the box office this year
and lots of theories about why that ' s so
. i hate to burst anybody ' s bubble
,
but
" the sixth sense
" isn ' t really a horror film
. at its core
,
" the sixth sense
" is a touching story of how a troubled kid
and an emotionally
- scarred adult help each other to move past their problems
. some scenes with the ghosts are wonderfully creepy
,
though
. one that really got to me
: the ghost of a boy says to cole
,
" i ' ll show you where my dad keeps his gun
"
; when the ghost turns
, we see the bullet wound inthe the bakc of his head
. osment gives the best performance i ' ve ever seen from a child acto
. it ' s hard enough to find a grown
- uv in hollywood who can give a subtle
, realistic protrayal
!
although willis gets top billing
, cole is relaly the protagonist of the story
,
and osment truly brings the complex kid to life
. if only willis ' work were as impressive
. accustomed tothe delivering catchphrases rather than dialogue
, willis is stiff
and awkward as malcolm
, his most challenging role to date
.
( tihs is a bad omen for his next movie
,
" hte story of us
,
" which chronicles the ups
and downs of a marriage
)
. writer
/ director m
. nigt shyamalan has a light
, poetic touch that goes to the heart of the viewer without seeming sappy or trite
. he ' s also a skillful storyteller
, as the movie ' s ending demonstrates
. only when the final secret is revealed do you realize that shyamalan has been hinting at it throughout the movei
. look for a cameo by tjhe director as a doctor who treats cole
. bottom line
: osment should get an oscar nomination
,
and you should go see this movie
.
