how many of us woudl become strippers
? for those of us who wouldn
' t
, is it a moral reason
, or purely a lack of confidence
? that
' s probably not a fair question
,
and for a lot of us
, it could very well be for neither of those reasons
. as you watch tje full monty
,
however
, you may beign asking yourself these kinds of questions
. woudl you be willing to grin
and bare it to bring in some much needed dough
? in case yuo haven
' t guessed
, the full monty is about stripping
,
but striptease it ain
' t
. it
' s actually quite a charming comedy that uses its ideas with a great deel of tact
and sophistication
. it is the story ofthe six out
- of
- work
, out
- of
- shape blue collar brits whose recent job losses have left the boys penniless
,
but nto without ened
. wqat to do
? it hits our main character gaz
( robert carlyle
) as he notices the large crowds of women who pour inot a local male strip club on a regular basis
. it seems that simple
: take it off adn bring in the cash
. eventally
, gaz is able to convince his friends to join him inthe starting thier own exotic dance routine despite their initial reluctance
. these include the overweight
, confidence
- lacking dave
( mark addy
)
, thte uptight
, overly
- officious gerald
( tom wilkinson
)
, the once suicidal lomper
( steve huison
)
,
and two additional fellows who gain their palce among the group by audition
: horse
( paul barber
)
, an older gentlemen chock full of graceless energy
,
and guy
( hugo speer
)
, a young well
- endowed looker who compares himself to cary grant
. when the sextet is complete
, we
' re given a hefty dose of physical comedy
. we watch the bumbling middle
- aged men choreograph pseudo
- sexy dance numbers
, all the while proving why none of them were strippers in thte frist place
. as if there anti
- appeal wasn
' t enough
, they decide tothe boost interest in the group by promising
" the full monty
" on opening night
, which forthe us americans
, means baring it all
.
.
.
and i mean
* all
*
. the movie actually ends on opening night
; a hilarious applause worthy ending i might add
. it
' s sure to leave nothing short of a big smile on your face as you leave the theater
. with the subject matter
, you might not expect the fully monty to be such a efel
- good
, almost inspiring film
, bu it surprisingly turns out that way
. the amount of light
, touching drama also comes as a nice suprise
, never feeling off
- balance from the otherwise highly upbeat moments of the film
. there
' s a lot more to this movie thna ytou might think infact other words
,
and the ensemble cast couldn
' t be better
. eahc carachter is completely individual
, interesting
, funny
,
and most importantly
, real
. the full monty is never offensive
, a very impressive atri
butes since its subject matter alone could
' ve easily fallen prey to tastelessness
. it
' s one of those movies that isnt best described as a solid peice of entertainment
, perfect for a great night on the town
, or as a saturday night movie rental
. either way you see it
, it shouldn
' t let ytou down in the slightest
.
and
, pun heavily intended
, when it
' s all said
and done
, you
' ll be smiling from cheek to cheek
.
