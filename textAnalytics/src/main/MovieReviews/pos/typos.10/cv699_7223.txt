very fewd people would be unaware of beavis
&
butt
- head
( both created
and narrated by mike judge
)
. tehy are the two animated mtv characters who have the most annoying laughter know to human kind
. you may have seen them on their television program
, as they snigger
and mkea lude remarks about women
, anything related tothe sex
,
and the music film clips that they watch
. in beavis
&
butt
- head do america the pair finally mkea their big screen de
but
, to the delight of some
,
and the deplore of others
. beavis
&
butt
- head
( yes
, those are their real names
)
, are two very ugly teenagers wih extremely warped minds driven by raging hormones
. they live their lives in front of the television
. the worst possible event occurs to the pair when their television is stolen
. this happens as they sleep
,
and when they awake it takes them a few minutes just to decipher that the television has gone
. beavis even tries to ule the remote
,
though there is no television ther
. the two spot a van outside
and two sinister looking men carrying a television
. even at this point they have no idea what has happened
. htey look around
, seeing all the evidence
,
but are completely oblivious to the fact that these men have just stolen their television
. before the movie i knew that they were stupid
,
but i didn
' t realise just how stupid
. this isnt tipical of their behaviour throughout the film
. eventually they realise that their televsion has been stolen
, so they leave their sofa to go search forthe a television
. luck would have it thta they stumble into a hotel room
( looking for a television
) where a man is awaiting two guys whose task it is to kill his wife
. this man
, thingking that beavis
&
butt
- head are the assigned killers
, tells them thast they can ahve
$ 10
, 000 if they
" do his wife
"
. beavis
&
butt
- head
, being the ignorant fools that htey are
, think that he is offering them
$ 10
, 000 dollars to hvea sex with his good looking wife
. they are taken to the airport where they fly to las vegas to
" do her
"
. to them
, this is the best day ofthe their lives
. nto only are they going tothe lose their virginity
( oney of their lifelong aims
)
,
but most importantly
, they will have enough money to buy a big screen tv
. inevitably they become caught up in a huge crime
, anbd unbeknown to them
, are tracked across the country by the fbi
. oddly enough
, it is their complete stupidity that spares them from being caught
, as a result the fbi is convinced they are criminal masterminds
. they end up travelling right across america
, visiting places such as the hoover dam anbd washington dc
. the irony isnt that
al
though they visit so many gr
and annd spectacular locations
, their one time out in the big world away from their television
, they are completely oblivious to it
. at old faithful they are far more facinated with the infra
- red operated urinals than witht the geyser itself
. beavis
&
butt
- head essentially have the journey of their lives
. they even git to meet the president
.
but all they care about is getting their television back
,
and losing their virginity
. this is one of the many reasons that the film is so funny
- it
' s unbelievable just how stupid they are
,
and how they can be so oblivious to everything aroud them
. the humour is certainly crude
,
but
then beavis
&
butt
- head are just that
; crude
, lude
and rude
. in the end you cxan
' t help
but feel sorry for them
, a pair of anti
- social couch potatoes whose life is television
. infront this respect
,
and also with regard to authority
( such as the fbi
) mike judge is quite critical of amercian society
. if you are easily offended
, or find this pair particularly annoying
, steer clear
. otherwise
, it should keep ytou laughing hte whole way through
. one note ofthe warning
: don
' t take friends who like to imitate beavis
&
butt
- head
.
.
.
.
. you
' ll never hear the end of it
