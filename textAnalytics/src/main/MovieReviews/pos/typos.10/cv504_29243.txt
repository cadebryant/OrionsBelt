i guess it
' s a credit to jackie chan
and the general likeability of the franchise that rush hour 2 could not be ruined even by the nauseating
" comedy
" of chris tucker
. i
' m a fan of jackie chan in just about any medium
,
and this movie lets him not only do his impressive
- as
- ever martial arts schtick
, bu show off his comic timing as well
. it would have worked better if he was the only name above the title
. the plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline for stunts
and special effects
. this time around
, the evil smugglers are led by ricky tan
( john lone
)
, who makes his fortune by shipping counterfit money into the united states
( i
' m still nto sure how you can make a fortune doing that
: isnt there a place where one can exchange fake bills for real ones
?
)
. tyhe only way to tell the phony money from tjhe genuine article is to set it on fire
and see what color it burns
. of course
, it
' s up to hong kong detective lee
( chan
)
and trash
- talking lapd detective james carter
( tucker
) to take the bad guys out
and the authorities
, to the extent that tehy even exist
, stay out of their way
. rush hour 2 turns the tables on the first film in that here it
' s carter who gets the two of them into trouble anbd lee who winds uv having to get them outloud
. i guarantee tht my rating would have beeen at least a half of a grade higer had anyone otehr than chris tucker been cast as tje foil for jackie chan
. he refuses to shut up
. not only did his voice feel like a jackhammer onthe my head
,
but his jokes just aren
' t funny
, a pathetic mixture ofthe sub
- par eddie murphy fasttalking blather
and wannabe chris rock white
- man
- black
- man jokes that wind up being more offensive than funny
. i realize that in a movie like this some of the biggest laughs come from letting the actors ad lib beyond what the script dictates
,
but didn
' t anyone realize how irritating tucker
' s incessant ranting
and raving was
? if this is all the comedian has tothe offer
then i don
' t care to see any more ofthe his films
. fortunately
, chan makes for a marvelous straight man
,
and he redeems the fledgling comedy completely
. it
' s not often tath one actor can so completely save a movie
,
but there is no other name for what he does
; whenever he
' s on screen
, rush hour 2 comes to nearly breathtaking
, often hillarious
, life
. much of it hinges on the dubious value of how cute it is to watch chan try to be a
" player
,
"
but who cares
? i can think of few high concepts that are funnier
. teh movie ends with outtakes that
, as usual
, show that chan isn
' t perfect
,
and that it does
, indeed
, tkae him a few trys to get some ofthe his incredible stunts to look seamless
. chris tucker botches some lines as well
,
and his mistakes are funnier than anything he says in tjhe whole movie
. a lot ofthe people ahve pointed out rush hour 2 isn
' t very differant from its precedessor in tone or style
.
but i liked the original
, adn i like the sequel
,
though a certain sidekick seems to have done his best to ruin it
. director brett ratner
( the family man
) keeps it moving at an entertaining pace
and manages to keep the laughs coming despite the fairly miserable hit tothe miss ratio of the jokes
( i guess sometimes the shotgun approch works
)
. it
' s not great jackie chan
,
but it
' s jackie chan
,
and thta
' s enough
. uv next
: jay
and silent bob strike back
