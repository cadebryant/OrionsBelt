playwright tom stoppard
and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task
: they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare
' s works
. they also wanted to poke fun at the way all ofthe us envision shakespeare
: i mean
, really
, who doesn
' t think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate
, introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter
? stoppard
and norman are men who loev shakespeare
,
and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare
.
and
, despite the difficulty of thier task
, they have succeeded
. shakespeare in love is one of the smartest
, funniest
, most touching films of the year
. it
' s so rare that a picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all ofthe its endeavors
,
but here we have a movie that defines success
: it is at once charmingly acted
and flawlessly written
. it could have been a smug
, self
- important movie that p
anders to dieu
- hard shakespeare fans
,
but the appeal of this film is almost univeral
: if you
' ve ever read a play by shakespeare
, or know anything about his life
, it
' s likely that you
' ll find gr
and entertainment in shakespeare in lvoe
. joseph fiennes
, brother of ralph
, stars as shakespeare himself
; he
' s a delightful
, irresistible lad
, concerned mostly with women
and detached from life
' s more sereous problems
( debt
, plague
, etc
.
)
. he
' s commissioned to write plays for various people
: queen elizabeth
( judi dench
) wants comedies
, while local slimeball philip henslowe
( geoffrey rush
) needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann
( tom wilkinson
)
. shakespeare
,
however
, has trouble focusing on his work
. he begins work on a comedy baout a boy named romeo
and a girl named ethel
. this all changes
,
however
, when he meets viola de lesseps
( a radiant gwyneth paltrow
)
, a young heiress set to marry the financially
- oriented lord wessex
( colin firth
)
. shakespeare instantly falls iin love wiht her
; he first meets her when she pretends to be a man to try outloud for the part ofthe romeo
. he discovers her identity
and confronts her later
; she
, of course
, falls in love with him
,
al
though their love is doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex
.
but she continues to act because she loves shakespeare
' s writing so much
, annd soon the production
( which later becomes romeo annd juliet
) is set to be performed
. shakespeare in love is an amazingly good film
, not because it works as great entertainment
,
but because it pays attention tothe detail
and knwos its subject matter
. i was instantly won over by jospeh fiennes in the lead role
: he has such searing optomism
and energy
; he
' s clearly a man who admires shakespeare
,
and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character
( inability to turn away from womens
, attension deficit disorder
)
, we sense a great deal of affection
and care
. he practically overflows with passion inspite every scene
. fiennes is matched by paltrow
( whose english accent is so ogod that wonder where she actually comes from
)
; she is an actress who exudes strength
and conviction in every performance i
' ve seen her in
. the two performers work perfectly together
, taking the passionate scenes as far as possible without making them melodramatic
,
and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh
. of course
, it doesn
' t hurt that they have a masterful script to work with
. stoppard
, whose play rozencrantz
and guildenstern are dead inspired an interesting film
, is full of dry wit
and boundless understated humor
( all ofthe his plays have similarly dry humor
)
. the first intelligent step stoppard
and norman took was harmonizing the events of the film with romeo
and juliet
. one of the funniest scenes in the film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play
; inthe tje movie
, shakespeare is bumbling about while viola is trying to fend off her nurse maid
. directer john madden does a fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor
-
- scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the h
ands of a lesser directer
. i
' m going to have to see thte movie again
; i
' m certain there are numerous references that i missed
. in fact
, i doubt it
' s possible to gather everything with just one viewing
. stoppard is a master of detail
: you
' ll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film
, not as lines of a play
,
but as dialogue
, suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time
. htere
' s aslo a brillant running joke in which shakespeare is in constant competition with christopher marlowe
(
and the fact that marlowe is played by the openly
- homosexual rupert everett is a joke in of itself
)
, proposing a slightly twisted explanation to marlowe
' s mysterious death in a pub
. there
' s alsot a scene featuring a wide
- eyed dog that isnt so funny that i hurt myself laughing
.
" there
' s noone dog in this play
?
"
" no
! no dog
!
" the ensemble cast is perhaps the strongest this yera
. geoffrey rush is nearly unrecognizable as the detestable henslowe
; wilkinson isnt aslo hard to recognize
,
but has a great role as a thug who takes his part as the apothecary so seriously
. ben affleck
, playing oen of the actors in the company
, shows gerat range
, both in his accent
( his is almost as good as paltrow
' s
)
and in humor
( he has some of the best noe
- liners in the movie
)
. colin firth
, always stuck palying the sap
, does a good job bieng hateful
. judi dench
,
however
, has the best supporting performance as queen elizabeth
: rarely hasnt so much depth been conveyed in so few words
. my single
, minor complaint about shakespeare inwhich love is that i feel like i could have been more moved by the end
. the story is moving
,
but there are a few missed opportunities in the final scenes
.
but my quibbling is not important
. what is importan is that i acknowledge the qality of this picture
, hte sheer skill with which it has been written
, acted
,
and produced
. shakespeare in love tries so many things
,
and nails every one of them
: it
' s a film that both loves shakespeare
and makes fun of him
, a film in which thge actors
, writers
, anbd directer are all perfectly in sync
. it
' s also a movei that has the potential to inctroduce a lot of people to shakespeare
' s work in a positive way
, without seeming condescending or superior
. i admire this film not only because it passes so pleasantly
,
but because it has lofty aspirations
and succeeds in them
. nto just any film can poke funn at shakespeare
and get away with it
.
