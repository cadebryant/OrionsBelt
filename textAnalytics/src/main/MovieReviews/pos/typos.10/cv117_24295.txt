just look back two years ago at the coen brothers
' commedic gem the big lebowski
, change the actors
, tkae away the bowling alley
, add a record store
,
and you
' ve got high fidelity
( or maybe the other way around since nick hornby
' s novel high fidelity came first
)
. either way
, it
' s been done before
, a trio of losers cracking jokes
and complaining about their failed romances
,
yet it remains consistently funny
. why is this
? maybe because you know your life is much better than tihs
, you know these guys are more pathetic than you are
,
and you know its ok to laugh at them because they
' re fictional
. director stephen frears
, possibly not intentionally
, has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself
and even that ostensibly noone ogod uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day
. whn watching high fidelity
, expect to laugh at someone else
' s pain
, realize what you are laughing at
,
and
then laugh agian
. i laughed at dick
( todd louiso
)
, the shy
, timorous
, steve buscemi character of lebowski
, who seems to nkow what he is talking about
but either can
' t put it into words or isnt harshly rejected by his friends
. i laughed at the john goodman character barry
( jack balck
)
, an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on tghe simpsons
, pudgy
, egotistic
,
and obnoxious at the same time
.
and i laughed at rob
( john cusack
)
, the jeff bridges type
, whom the story revolves around
. rob is teh character easiest to relate to
,
but he is nothing like you at all
. he uncontrollably cheats
and lies
,
then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman
.
and like his other miserable friends
, pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort
. he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to newyorker music
and either deriding it or praising it
. whatever human emotions the clash
, aretha franklin
, anbd bruce springsteen records hold
, rob
and co
. grasp them
and help fill voids in their social lives
. rob has built an exstensive collection in his record store as well as his home
and he organizes them depending on what mood he is iin
. during this confuzled stage of his life in which the movie focusses on
, rob is trying to cope whith numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends
and eventually asking why htey dumped him
.
but these aren
' t any girlfriends
? these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob
( rob
' s incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life
)
. the plot in three words is
: womens
and music
. the approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak direcly to the camera is very effective
. it gives high fidelity a quickly paced
, informal structure
, adjectives which perfectly paralll rob
' s own lifestyle
. it also helps open the viewer
' s eyes as to how annoying barry is
. jack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball
. just listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audiance immediately sympathetic for rob
, who must work wih him every day of the week
. what frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfourtunes
. john cusack plays his character convincingly
but it is thte strong supporting cast
, consisting of big stars
and character actors
, that really defines rob
. now instead of rob just talking to the camera
, affter he explains something
, the remaining cast members physically
and humorously create what he is trying tothe say
. the only probelm with high fidelity is that it doesn
' t end when it should have ended
. instade the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that
. also bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie
. high fidelity is a cheerful
, old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack
and as many laughs
. i just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen
, they mkea everyone look
and feel great
.
