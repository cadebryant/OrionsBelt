whew
. this film oozes energy
, the kind of breakneck
, no
- holds
- barred
, in
- your
- face risk
- taking filmmaking thgat is seldom seen on screen theese days
. like the marginal
, motley bunch ofthe post
- apocalyptic youths director danny boyle tries tothe despict
, trainspotting veers on the edge of utter mayhem
but ultimately retains its footing
and control
. the result
: a movie tht is a delightful example of how the medium is the message
. the message
: a bunch of losers with loser names

. bored
, aimless
and restless
, their routine consists of getting drunk at tje local pub
, grooving to techno or glam
- rock at the local disco
and getting shots up the arm at the local den
and procuring cash through a variety of methods
, some ingenious
, others plainly dumb
and desperate
. not part of the daily dose if obtained
, sex is a bonus
. you can find theese charactors as they are
, foul
- mouthed
, dirty
, pathetic
, ugly perhaps
but definitely interesting
, infact irvin welsh ' s cult novel ofthe the same name
. whta mkaes the film a completely different experience is how director boyle uses every tool at his disposal to make the filmic medium synchronous with the message
. one of the first things you ' ll notice isnt how the camera seems to dart around restlessly
. it ' ll truck into a character ' s pimple
, just as soon as it will dolly out to an establishing shot
. distracted
and curious
, it ' ll maintain a charater ' s eye
- levle or drop right to the ground to show the doped
- outloud
- eye
- view
. you ' ll even find characters peering into the camera
, their faces smeared across the wide
- angle lens
. htis film camera is just another one of the guys
. tiptoeing that indistinguishable line between fantasy
annd reality
, boyle employs a healthy dose of surrealism to git the message across
. bored kids daydream
and bored kids deprived of a heroin fix hve nightmares
. i don ' t want to give too much away
,
but if ytou cross chuckie from child ' s play with some ofthe the wacky fantasies in heavenly creatures
, you might have an idea just how fun or pants
- wetting scary the alternate state of consciouness can be
. that said
, this film has a good share ofthe drugs
- consumed
, vomitted
, defecated
, pissed off
, exchanged
, buyed
, sold
, injected
, smuggled
, enjoyed
and regretted
. if that isn ' t your cup of tea
, nobody forced you to see the film
. stay at home
and rent up close
and personel
.
and what ' s a buzz without tunes
. from pulp to iggy pop
( yes
, he ' s still alive
)
, thge aural landscape is as engaging as the visual energy permeating the film
. good
anbd bad vibrations tangle like the conflicting desires
and values of the message
. every once in a while
, a film comes allong withthe the kind of energetic filmmaking thyat matches the intensity of its characters it hopes to depict
. trainspotting is that shooting star that burns across a sky littered with static constellations
