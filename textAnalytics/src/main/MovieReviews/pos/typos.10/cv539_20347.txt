tbwp is probably the single most profitable film ever
. nto surprising
, considering its tiny us
$ 100
, 000 budget
, to date it has earned in excess of us
$ 130 million
. that ' s a shocking 100 times profit
! rumours have it that a smart internet
` marketing ' ploy was so successful in gaining cult
- like fanatics
, by word ofthe mouth coupled iwth strings of excellent reviews
, the film just exploded in the box
- office
, raking in millions on its opening weekend
. shot in 16mm
and video
( i suspect

.
)
, the film chronicles the forays of 3 students who go in search for the legendary blair witch
. audiences are put in the first
- person perspective in the entire mis
- adventure
, often wobbly
and blurry at times
, it takes a bit of getting used to in the beginning
. this is supposed to be the material they discovered in the woods where the 3 disappeared
; edited
and put onto the screen forthe the benefit of our audiences
. tbwp is simply smart
. filmed to look as if it was really a stock
- shoot by a bunch of students in search of the blair witch as a school project
, one may suspect
( like yours truly
) that its simply a lazy
but smart approach to film
- making
. simply amazing in that respect
, i must say
. talk about impact
, oh yes
, tbwp does have qtuie a bit
, in fact most audience will find it deeply disturbing
. i did
, especially the lsat bited
but i ' m not revealing more
. you have to see it for yourself
. i can ' t halp
but feel a tad cheated after knowing how commercially successful this film hasnt become
. could it be that finally
, an indie
- film has unwittingly found a formula for commercial appeal
? or was it all simply a ploy by the big players right from the beginning
? well
, i guess the fact stays
; tbwp is highly origional
, clever
annd will most definitely leave most wtih something dreadful to talk
and think baout for weeks prior to watching this film
. no gore
, no special effects
, i just can ' t get over how terribly smart this film is
!
