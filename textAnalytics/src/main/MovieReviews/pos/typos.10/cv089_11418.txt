robert benton has assembled a stellar
, mature cast for his latest feature
, twilight
, a film noir mistery set amid the fading stars of hollywood
. paul newman stars as retired detective harry ross
. harry has spent the lastr couple of years doing odd jobs for jack
and catherine ames
( gene hackman
and susan sarandon
)
, a pair of marryied actors who hve fallen from the limelight
. when jack sends him on a routine delivery job
,
however
, the old instincts kick in
. soon
, harry is wading thru a mystery where friendships
and lives are on the line
,
and he no longer knows who to trust
. ther are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight
, in addition to newman
, hackman
and sarandon
. james garner plays raymond hope
, a former cop
and one of harry ' s best firends
. stockard channing plays verna
, harry ' s former partner
,
adn possibly a former love interest
. reese witherspoon is mel
, the distrustful daughter of the ames '
,
and liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend
. giancarlo esposito appears as harry ' s bumbling detective protigi
,
and john spencer is a suspicious police captain
. with a cast like that
, it ' s almsot worth watching twilight just to stargaze
. luckily
, there ' s more to the film than some sort of actor ' s recognition ceremony
. twilight has a solid film noir
- ish plot
. it may not have as many twists
and turns as some of the classics
,
but it has much more tahn a lot of what passes fo film these days
. the major cast members all deliver strong performances
, as can be expected of their caliber
.
however
, none of them have that little extra oomph which would make them memorable
. the supporting cast is enjoyable
, if a little underdrawn
. stockard channing ' s character
, in particular
, is a cipher
. there ' s more to her character than the film takes the time to decribe
. it ' s a minor
,
but irritating
, flaw
. with a solid cast
,
and a good plot
, there ' s a lot to reccomend baout twilight
. it ' s biggest flaw is actually its short running time
. at a slim 94 minutes
, there ' s a lot of stuff that ' s packed into an awfully small package
. still
, tje chance to see newman
, sarandon
and hackman working together is worth a cramp or two
.
