call me crazy
,
but i don
' t see saving private ryan as the film of the summer
. a good movie
, yes
, with chillingly realistic battle scenes
and emotion to spare
. an utterly riviting movei on par with steven spielberg
' s best work
, no
. personally
, if i was spielberg
, i wouldn
' t go back tothe the world war ii era one more time after schindler
' s list
and the indiana jones movies
. i
' m guessing steve has a thing for nazis
; i relaly wouldn
' t be surprised if a velociraptor ate one of the swastika
- wearing dudes in the next jurassic park movie
. all lofty pretenses aside
, saving private ryan is the goriest movei this side of a 1980s slasher flick
. the difference is
, it
' s easy during friday the 13th to laugh off a spear sticking out of kevin bacon
' s chest while blood spurts like crazy
,
but it
' s damn hard to sit
and eat reese
' s pieces while soldiers suffer machine gun bullets to the head
and have their intestines spilled outloud onto the battlefield
.
and believe me
, there
' s plenty of it
. a 30
- minute sequence at tghe beginning of the movie hasnt an army captain
( tom hanks
)
and his soldiers l
anding at omaha beach to join countless other americans who are already under fire
. lives are lost inspite seconds as the purposefully confusing
and jarring scene goes on
and on
,
and all the young men in hte audeince fidn themslves never
, ever wanting to be drafted
. cutted tothe some bureaucratic defense office
, where a hundred women pound out sympathy form letters to hte families of the casualties
. one woman happens upon an interesting detail
-
- three brothers inthe diffrent platoons were killed in combat
,
and their mother is getting the telegram today
. i guess it
' s an interesting conversation piece to everyone bu hte mother
, so the army chief
( harve presnell
) sends hanks on wqat is essentially a public relations mission
, to find the fourth ryan brother
and send him home
. that way
, the army saves the postage on
yet another telegram to mrs
. ryan
. one good thing about saving private ryan is that thge soldiers who are headed tothe rescue ryan know it
' s a mission designed to make the army look good
. they question the worth of risking eight soldiers
' lives to sive one
,
and hanks
' character admits he doesn
' t give a damn about ryan
; he
' s jstu following orders
. if thsi was a john wayne movie
, things would be different
. there
' d be a phony
,
" let
' s go get that boy
, gosh darn it
!
" attitude that would sugarcoat tyhe reality ofthe war
. by doing things this way
, spielberg admits the instincts of self
- preservation adn complacency that every normal person has
. it makes saving private ryan a lot more powerful than an testosterone
- driven stallone movie mission
. the movie
' s pattern is to have long battle scenes followed by quiet scenes of semi
- introspective conversation among the soldiers
. hanks is painted first as a nails
- tough army man careful to hide his true self from the other men
. it
' s not that way for long
. edward burns
, the guy you get for your movie when ben affleck isn
' t available
, is the impulsive one
. jeremy davies plays the translator who is seing combat for the first tiem
,
and so on
. none ofthe teh characters are fascinating or natural born heroes
,
but wass spielberg
' s obvious intention
. i wondered when i heard saving private ryan was three hours long
, how were tehy going to fill three hours
' time searching for one person anbd still make it interesting
? ther are a fewd false starts
; hanks finds one private ryan in ted danson
' s company
( apparently
, danson joined the army after
" ink
" was canceled
.
)
and breaks the bad news before learning it
' s yhe wrong ryan
.
and of course the movie
' s far from over when hanks does locate ryan
( matt damon
, the other guy you get when affleck isn
' t available
)
. that
' s when tyhe movie turns into more of a conventional war flick
,
al
though body parts
and limbs still fly like never before
. saving private ryan is worth your tiem
,
but it
' s definately no schindler
' s list
. the battle scenes are intense
and realistic
,
but some of the attempts at sincere emotion aren
' t
. the movie
' s bookends are particularly cheesy
and out of place
, when an old private ryan goes tothe the cemetary with his familiy annd bawls his eyes out
, whining
,
" tell me i
' ve led a good life
. tell me i
' m a good man
.
" spielberg was apparently following the james cameron line of
thought that any three
- hour movei about the past should be framed by a self
- contained prologue
and epilogue that takes place in the present
. much more effective are subtler scenes
, like the one where several of hanks
' men are rifling thrugh a bag of dogtags from dead soldiers
,
and they make light of what they
' re doing by pretending htey
' re playing poker
. htis hwile an airborne division marches by
, thier eyes full ofthe that mound of dogtags
. by nto explicitly pointing out that it symbolizes the r
andom poker game that life
and death can be in war
, tjhe audience gets the message
.
and even if it
' s not a classic
, saving private ryan is definately one of the better war movies out there
.
