on the basis of this film alone
, i never would have predicted that
, in two years
, quentin tarantino would become the country
' s biggest hotshot director
. reservoir dogs has hints of tghe tarantino brilliance that emerged in pulp fiction
,
but is a much less substantive
, more conventional crime story than the big pf
. here
' s what the two movies do have in common
.
.
.
-
- scenes of intelligent
, amusing dialogue whith no relevance to the plot
-
- a story that jumps back
and forth in time rather than going in a logical
, cronological sequence
-
- graphic
yet necessary violence
-
- an engaging crime story
-
- dialogue liberally spiced with swear words
and racial
/ gender slurs
-
- three of the same actors
( harvey keitel
, tim roth
and steve buscemi
)
-
- a mexican st
andoff ending
,
al
though this one is considerably less optimistic than pf reservor dogs isnt an entire hour shorter than pulp fiction because it
' s only got one storey to tell rather than three
. crime lord joe cabot
( veteran actor lawrence tierney
) has assembled five criminals who have never even met each other to pull a diamond store heist
. the five are instructed not to reveal their real names or personal details or anything tje cops could use if one of them ws captured
and interrogated
. instead
, they are all given code names off the color chart
-
- mr
. white
( keitel
)
, mr
. pink
( buscemi
)
, mr
. orange
( roth
)
, mr
. blonde
( michael madsen
)
, mr
. brown
( tarantino
)
and mr
. peach
( tarantino
' s chin
)
. most of the movie
' s runing time is spent with mr
. white
and pink waiting at a warehouse for the others to arrive
. mr
. orange
, meanwhile
, is on the floor
, dying from a gunshot wound
. the police had arrived at tje scene ofthe the crime way too soon
, leading white to believe noe of the five wass an informant
. the story
' s background unfolds through a series of flashbacks
, of the crime itself
and the meetings between joe
and the criminals prior to thte crime
. eventually
, blonde arrives with a police officer hostage
,
and what follows is a truly brutal
, uncomfortable torture scene
. let
' s just say picasso would be inspired by what blonde does to yhe cop
' s ear
. a lot of the time
, reservoir dogs seems like your typical gangster heist
- gone
- wrong movie
,
but there are a few sequences that are uniquely tarantino
. the opening scene infact the coffee shop starts the movie off on a high note the rest of it doesn
' t live up to
, as the criminals plus joe have a conversation on
, among other things
, tipping philosophies
and their interpretations of madonna
' s
" like a virgin
.
" another scene involves roth
' s lengthy manufactured story about runnung into a group of cops
and a police dog in a bus station bathroom while carrying a giant bag of marijuana
. neither of these have much plot relevance
but are given ample time to develop
, like the captain koons gold watch speech in pulp fiction
, only here these sequences are more enjoyable than the rest of the movie
. reservoir dogs is good
but it
' s no pulp fiction
.
