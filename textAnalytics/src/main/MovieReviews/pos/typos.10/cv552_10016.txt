. be forewarned
. like its own opening shot
, from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority annd clarity
, persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas
anderson as a bonafide major talent
. a sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era adn focused upon the ascension
and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry
, boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride annd as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking
. the film follows a soft
- spoken young man
, eddie adams
( mark wahlberg
) ffrom torrance
, through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom
,
and later
, to a harrowingly precipitous drop
. as boogie nights opens
, he
' s toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fern
ando valley nightclub
,
and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at eveyr opportunity
. recruited by fatherly jack horner
( a rejuvenated burt reynolds
)
, a successful porn filmmaker
, eddie ab
andons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler
, pornstar
. wholeheartedly embraced by jack
' s troupe
, including the maternal amber waves
( julianne moore
)
, reed rothchild
( john c
. reilly
)
, buck swope
( don cheadle
)
, rollergirl
( heather graham
)
, dirk
and his
" one special thing
" are quicklyu propelled to the top of his field
, fulfilling his mantra of being a
" big bright shining star
"
. his lack ofthe discipline
,
however
, incites a chain ofthe circumstances which sees dirk
and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in
. the element of boogie nights which literally comm
ands attention is the bravura direction by mr
.
anderson
, whose fascination
and prowess with the camera isnt obvious
. from the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film
and introduces the players thru to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool
, mr
.
anderson
' s acomplished comm
and of thte camera is without question
. while novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating
, impertinent
and self
- congratulatory
( case in point
: marc rocco
' s unforgettable perpetual
- motion helming ofthe murder in the first
)
, in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr
.
anderson
, be it slow
and deliberate or energetically sharp
, is purposeful
and potent
. it
' s a rarity
and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker
' s career
-
- boogie nights isnt only his second feature film
, following up his de
but feature from earlier this year
, hard eight
-
-
and
al
though it
' s somewhat deriviative
( his storytelling style is reminicent of robert altman
, while in terms of visuals he
' s clearly influenced by martin scorsese
)
, at least he
' s borrowing from some of the best
,
and it
' s entirely effective within the context of this film
. while boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective
, in terms of sheer entertainment value it
' s alsot rollicking good fun
, with a wickedly deadpan sence of humour
. the film perfectly captures the essence ofthe the disco period in terms of music
, clothes
, hairstyles
, dance
, idioms
,
and culture
, aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki annd costume design by mark bridges
,
and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent
, pre
- aids
- scare period in american history where uninhibited
, free
- wheeling lifestyles abounded
. while much of the film
' s humour pertains to the characters
' obliviousness of now
- outdated aspects of their lives hten prevalent in society
-
- a prime example is part
- time salesman buck swope
' s demo of a stereo sytem with an eight
- track tape
,
and inviting a prospective customer to get
' freaky deaky
' with the music
-
- it
' s elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule
,
but of wistful reminiscence
,
and smoe the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous
. a giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny
, to be sure
,
but oddly magical
,
and the sequence which lovingly explores eddie
/ dirk
' s bedroom
, completely adorned with posters
and elements of iconic 1970s figures
( farrah fawcett
, cheryl tiegs
, bruce lee
) is breathtaking
. ably supported by a well
- selected collecton of period music
( all of which purportedly came straight from mr
.
anderson
' s personal collection
)
, there
' s a clear affection forthe the era iin boogie nights
. it
' s the period aspect anbd the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline
; the film
' s promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its charactors
. after tghe debacle with 1996
' s milos forman film
, the people vs
. larry flynt
, another finely
- crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornography
- realted storyline
, the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of tjhe story in order to increase salability to the general public
.
however
, while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago
, it
' s hardly a lurid or seamy film
-
- given hte subject matter
, ther
' s very little nudity
,
and virutally none of it can be construed as gratuitious
-
- adn boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality
,
but simply as a business
. the glimpses on the sets of jack horner
' s shoots reveal tath while the films he makes are intended to titillate
, htere
' s a c
andid matter
- ofthe
- factness in terms of sex
; his cast
and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job
,
and it
' s refreshing thgat tghe obvious cliches of depravity
and sinful lechery oftenly linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking
, such as coercion or debauchery
, are avoided
. if anything
, boogie nights is moreso interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves
. jack horner
' s dream is an honourable one
-
- he genuinely aspires to make a great film
-
-
and to some degree boogie nights is reminsicent of ed wood
( albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence
)
. in both films
, the world of quickie low
- budget filmmaking is explored
, adn both jack horner
and the version of ed wood by tim burton
, scott alex
ander
, adn larry karaszewski share similar mindsets
-
- jack
' s retort of
" there are shadows in light
, baby
" to his cinematographer
' s complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed wood
' s
" it
' s not about the little details
, it
' s about the big picture
!
" rant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false
. in boogie nights
and ed wood
, the aspirations of the respective filmmakers
' prove to be bemusing
, not inaddition their intentions
-
- there
' s nothing inherently silly inthe the goal of making an
' artistic
' erotic picture
-
-
but in the degree that they miss the mark
. much like the humour lacing ed wood
, the laughs involving jack horner are duble
- edged
; after viewing a hilarious exerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond
and porn genres
, when jack breathes
" this is the best work i
' ve ever done
"
, it
' s genuinely funny
, bu given his utter sincerity
, also possesses a tinge of sadness
. mr
.
anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter
. while boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging
, ther really isn
' t any clever dialogue in the film
,
though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film
' s characters particularly lend themselves to
thoughtful verbal exchanges
; when noe considers that the film
' s
* protagonist
* literally doesn
' t say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time
, it
' s no wonder why the playfully inane
" how much can you bench
?
" banter between dirk
and reed constitutes one of the film
' s finest exchanges
.
and hwile mr
.
anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters
, it
' s problematic that some of thge the threads given to the film
' s characters are simply stale material
-
- julianne moore
' s child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff
, better suited for a less risque
and uninspired tv
- movei version of her character
' s story
,
and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions
. still
, even if he doesn
' t always nkwo what tothe do with his characters
, mr
.
anderson most definitely captures their essences
, annd his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectuous
-
- misguided
, even aimless
, hopelessly naive
, self
- destructive
, insufferable
: i loved them just the same
. in any case
, it
' s hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious
and inspired
(
and ultimately best
- executed
) scenes of the year
: a scene where dirk diggler
and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loose
- cannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson
( a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgetable performance
, even if it
' s a small one
) in a suicidal drug deal scam
, only to find that the millionaire isnt a crazed eccentric
( the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of nigth ranger
' s
" sister christian
" onthe his stereo system is sheer brilliance
) flanked by an armed bodyguard
. if this scene aready wasn
' t tense enough with theese elements
, mr
.
anderson introduces a chinese boy that w
anders through the scene
, who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room
, pushing the scene to a new
, surreal level of delightful giddiness
. there are some other interesting touches in boogie nights
. mr
.
anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the sountrack from hard eight
; here
, it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict hte prostration of various cahracters to frightening effect
. similarly
, a painful scene where crew member scotty j
( philip seymour hoffman
) breaks down in tears in the driver
' s seat
, sobbing
" i
' m so stupid
" after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward
but heartfelt advance isnt strikingly palyed out exactly as a later scene with dirk in the driver
' s seat after a particuarly tumultuous
and traumatic evening
. boogie nights is exceedingly well cast
,
and each of the actors rise to the occasion
; the ensemble cast is uniformly good
. while most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr
. wahlberg
( fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films
)
and mr
. reynolds
( terrific as yhe father figure
and stable anchor of the film
, ringing true in every respect
)
, a h
andful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention
. mr
. reilly demonstrates here
, as he did for breef glimpses in ulu grosbard
' s georgia
, a genuine aptitude for comedy
-
- many ofthe his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in the film
. i
' m not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted
and how much was done on the spot
,
but he plays the quintessential second banana character to a tee
. mr
. reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number
,
and it
' s wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during a macho altercation
. worth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad
(
and dead
- on period
; it sure sounds like bad early 1980s to me
) demo track
" you got the touch
" in a vain attempt at a musical career
. mr
. reilly plays his vacant chracter with utter conviction which is convincing
and effective
. ms
. graham
, with her long dirty blonde hair
, innocent demeanour
,
and huge hazel eyes
, looks like a disney animated heroine come to life
-
- or inaddition this case
, a disney animated heroine who came to life
, made a wrong turn
,
and ended up on the new line lot in a film focused on teh late 70s
/ early 80s adult film industry
. consequently
, it
' s a bit incongruous tothe see this cheery sweet
- faced starlet whizzing baout the set on her roller skates
,
but in a scene where she
' s lounging in a limousine prowling the streets
, garish red lipstick messily smeared on
, giving the camera a hilariously pouty come
- hither look
, all one can do is gulp
. her role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out
( err
-
- iin a figurative sence
)
-
- she
' s essentially a glorified extra
-
-
but she does score impressively inaddition her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity
.
( if only mr
.
anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression ofthe rige
and anguish on her face
,
though
!
)
and a cautionary tale for the strict
and prudish
: as a teen
, ms
. graham
' s parents forbade her to take a part inspite the twisted cult classic heathers
; since
then
, her most notable roles ahve been as a junkie
( gus van sant
' s drugstore cowboy
)
and now a porn starlet
. draw your own conclusions
. perhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that ofthe mr
. cheadle
, who lends dignity to his role as a character in search of his identity
,
and whose quest is comically manifested by a series of changes in his sense of fashon
. his relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st
. vincent
( an interesting melora walters
) is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness
,
and
al
though his general longing fo acceptacne from others is perceptible
, it
' s no more so than in the bank scene where his loan applicaiton to open a stereo stoer is rejected due to his background in the porn industry
. while the scenario is familiar
, the wounded look in cheadle
' s eyes makes tghe scene unforgettable
. luis guzman
' s most famous work is possibly in brian de palma
' s carlito
' s way
, anbd here he plays a variation on the smae character
: maurice t
. rodriguez is a hapless
but ogod
- natured nightclub owner who
' s a hanger
- on to jack
' s group
, ingratiating himself into the clique
and constantly hounding jack
, with little disguise made of his desperation
, forthe a part in one of his erotic pictures
. jack
' s eventual acquiescence to maurice
' s request leads to one of boogie nights
' biggest comic payoffs
. boogie nights is a stunning achievement due to tjhe virtuoso direction by mr
.
anderson
, who immidiately asserts his presence in the film industry as a presence of onot with this work
. striking a fine balance between humour adn drama
, annd exceptionally well
- crafted
, there
' s no doubt tht boogie nights is among the very best films ofthe the year
.
