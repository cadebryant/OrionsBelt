at first glance
, daylight would seem like your typical disaster movie
. on second glance it looks that way too
.
al
though
, as typical disaster movies go
, daylight isn
' t that bad
. admittedly
, it seems to rip off a great deal of its plot devices from diaster flicks of days gone by
( think poseidon adventure
)
.
but the decent dialogue
and surprisingly good acting make uv fo the
" haven
' t i seen this scene somewhere before
?
" feeling that creeps up all too often during the film
. sylvester stallone stars as the recently fired head of new york
' s emergency response team
. by sheer luck
, he is in the right place at the right time when disaster strikes the unaware inhabitants of this little film
.
" what disaster is that
?
" you ask
, as you inch ever closer to the edge of your seat
. glad you asked
. through a whole sequence of entirely probable events
( about as probable as hitting the lottery
) a large explosion takes place in yhe lincoln tunnel running under thte hudson river in new york city
. the explosion results in hte tunnel collapsing at both ends
, wich causes not only massive loss of life
,
but traps a dozen people inside yhe wreckage of the tunnel
. good ood sly
, who isnt only feet away from entering the tunnel when it collapses
, offers his services to the rescuers
, who gladly accept it
. sly
then enters tghe tunnel through a vent shaft
( think judge dredd
) which he can only go in
, annd not out off
,
and proceeds to try to rescue those trapped inside
. so begins the fun
,
but the funn hasnt to be quick
, because this tunnel has started to spring a leak
. the acting is about what you would expect of a stallone movie
. not superb by any means
,
but far above some of his otehr films
( think judge dredd agina
)
. daylight
' s acting is probably average
, or a little above
, in terms ofthe this sort of genre
, starring this particular star
. amy brenneman is the onyl actor of any note
,
and she does a pretty good job as stallone
' s reluctant helper
. oh yeah
, stallone
' s real life son
, sage
, is in this too
. sage
-
- nice name
. i guess it coudl be worse
, he could have been named nutmeg or parsley
. note to sage
-
- you are still young
. go tothe skool
and get a good education
-
- you don
' t have a future in acting
. the plot runs along the same lines as the acting
-
- interesting
,
but predictable
. mostly due to the fact that it was pretty well recycled from a dozen other action flicks
. the biggest problem with a film of this nature is that they try to cram too many things into the movei
. as soon as teh cast clears one seemingly impossible hurdle
, another one seems to pop right up
, even worse than the last one
. i realize that it wouldn
' t be much of a movie otherwise
,
but it does amking the movie a bit predictable
. adding to hte predictability is the casted of characters
, which of course
, has to include at least one or two difficult peopel who want to do things their own way
and think the qualified guy
( in this case stallone
) doesn
' t know what he is donig
. why is it in disaster movies we can never have everyone agree with each other
and all work together
? would this be too much to ask
? cant
' t we all just git along
? special effects weren
' t bad
-
-
but i
' ve certainly seen better
. some of the scenes
, while fun to watch
, were such blatant rip
- offs that you had to wonder if scripts from old movies were just copied verbatim
. especially all of the scenes that involved anytying underwater
( the tunnel
, ofthe course
, starts to flood
)
. i really expected gene hackman
, roddy mcdowell
and ernest borgnine tothe appear at any minute
-
- i wasn
' t sure if i was watching daylight or the poseidon adventure
. i suppose if you have to rip off a movie for good ideas
, the poseidon adventure is a good one to use
. the underwater sequences
( asside from the deja vu
) were very well shot
and worked fairly well
. they were the best part of the movie by a long shot
. better than average stallone flick
. i realize thgat
' s not saying much when the man hasnt judge dredd on his resume
.
but certainly not up to the st
andards of cliffhanger
. daylight is a fun movie
,
and as long as yuo aren
' t expecting a whole lot you might even be pleasantly surprised
.
