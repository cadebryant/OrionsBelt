you
' ve got to love disney
. no matter what they serve up
, it is a guaranteed success as long as it
' s animated
. kids have to go see the movie
.
then they have to get the toys
. oh
, tjhe video came out
? got to buy it
, or risk little billy
' s temper tantrums for the next month
. all of this culminates in the childhood equivalent ofthe a pilgrimage to mecca
: a visit to the magic kingdom
. stay at the disneyl
and hotel
! buy a disney t
- shirt
! eat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick
! it
' s both a vertical
and horizontal monopoly when you think about it
. dale carnegie should have had it so good
. what
' s most amazing is that all this sucess is in spite of a severe lack of originality
. you see
, disney animated features these days have two components
: theme
and plot
. the theme changes with each new movie
; the plot does not
. the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped
,
and try as tehy might to rise above the charactors of previvous features
, they are nearly alwyas destined to do no more than the same
.
however
, while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box
- office receipts
, merch
andising dollars
,
and glimmers in the eyes of little children
, critically they are as varied as anything eles that hollywood has tothe offer
. luckily
, disney
' s latest animated offering
, mulan
, manages to be engaging
and refreshing
, even while rife with formula
. the film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns
, led by the imposing shan
- yu
( miguel ferrer
)
. soon
, china
' s emperor
( pat morita
) mobilizes his armies
and decrees that one male from each family in the ocuntry shall serve to fight infact china
' s defense
. when the fa family isnt served notice
, it isnt the elderly father
, fa zhou
( soon
- tek oh
) who must answer the call
, as there are no otehr males in the household
. fearing her father will surelly be killed in battle
, fa mulan
( ming
- na wen
) disguises herself as a man
and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army
. mulan
, based on a chineese epic poem
, is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugli duckling
. mulan herself is a disgrace to her loving famaly
, as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman
' s role
,
and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husban
, we see that
" grace
" is not one of her strong points
. very early on
, we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one
' s family
, annd by botching her chance at gaining the favor of thte matchmaker
, mulan fails at that task
. by leaving home to fight in her father
' s place
, she may not only spare his life
, bu bring honor
, too
. as is the case with most disney musicals
, the songs are first rate
and pervasive throughout the film
. i
' m not sure if they will get much airplay
,
but at least one of the songs will no dout receive recognition come oscar time
. both lea salonga
, who provides the singing voice forthe mulan
,
and donny osmond who sings for shang
, the captain of mulan
' s army unti
and obligatory love interest
, are more tahn competent
,
al
though salonga
' s voice translates much better to animation
. you have to hear it to underst
and
. interestingly
, the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan
. there is no significantly big number
, which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film
,
but this does nto detract significantly from the rest of the movie
. it is
,
however
, an expectation which has been built by disney
' s own formulaic history
,
and some viewers may feel as if something is missing
. artistically
, the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork
,
and
al
though this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works
, it helps to contri
bute a more au
thentic
,
and therefore more credible
, nature to wqat otherwise may be seen as a typically
" disneyfied
" ethnic tale
. there are also a couple of visually st
andout scenes
, one involving the charge of shan
- yu
' s hun army
, which utilizes hte same computer
- enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the ch
andelier in beauty
and the beast
. the other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it
. when mulan resolves to take her father
' s place
, she dons her father
' s ood battle armor
,
and unsheathes a sword
. as she does so
, you can see her reflection in the polished metal
. it just left me thinking
,
" that wass really cool
.
" a wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film
, varying from the straight
, such as soon
- tek oh as fa zhou
, to the comical
, such as harvey fierstein as yao
, a gruff
, pugilistic member of shang
' s conscripted army
. even more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu
, the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look aftter mulan
.
al
though an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams inaddition aladdin
, murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself wiht his own winning performance
. i found the choice of b
. d
. wong as shang a little strange
( you may remember him as martin short
' s wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride
)
,
but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty
and the beast
, so i guess anything
' s possible
. in any event
, wong performs admirably as well
. one character which provides a significant amount of humer is gr
andmother fa
. she deserves recognition not onyl because of the levity she brings to the movie
, bu also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people
. june foray
, who supplies gr
andmother fa
' s speaking voice
, is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel
and natasha fatale
( as in boris
and natasha
)
. marni nixon
, who provides gr
andmother fa
' s singing voice
, is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king
and i
, maria in west side story
,
and eliza in my fair lady
. with this in mind
, hearing gr
andmother fa is liuke listening to a little piece of history
. mulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films
. in an effort tothe be culturally sensitive
(
and to avoid a
" miss saigon
"
- tipe debacle
)
, disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asian
- american actors for both lead
and supporting roles
. in addition to the actors already maintioned
, the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong
, gedde watanabe
, james shigeta
,
and george takei
. i guess clyde kusatsu wasn
' t available
. at a running time of slightly under an hour
and a half
, mulan moves quickly
and provides solid entertainment for both children adn
, happily
, adults
. tihs is the kind of disney feature that makes ytou wonder what they will do next
, rather tahn hope tyhat the next one isnt better
.
