you ' ve got tothe lveo disney
. no matter what they serve up
, it is a guaranteed success as long as it ' s animated
. kids have to go see the movie
.
then they have to get tjhe toys
. oh
, the video cameback out
? got to buy it
, or risk little billy ' s temper tantrums for the next month
. all of this culminates inspite the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca
: a visit to the magic kingdom
. stay at the disneyland hotel
! buy a disney t
- shirt
! eat an ice cream mickey mouse onthe a stick
! it ' s both a vertical
and horizontal monopoly when you think baout it
. dale carnegie should have had it so good
. what ' s most amazing is that all this success is in spite ofthe a severe lack of originality
. you see
, disney animated features these days have two components
: theme
and plot
. the theme changes with each new movie
; the plot does not
. the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped
,
and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features
, they are nearly always dsetined to dont no more than the same
.
however
, while yhe success of a disney animated feature isnt generally a given as far as box
- office receipts
, merchandising dollars
,
and glimmers in the eyes of little children
, critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer
. luckily
, disney ' s latest animated offering
, mulan
, manages to be engaging
and refreshing
, even while rife with forumla
. the film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns
, led by the imposing shan
- yu
( miguel ferrer
)
. soon
, china ' s emperor
( pat morita
) mobilizes his armies
and decrees thast oney male from each family in tghe country shall serve to fight in china ' s defense
. when the fa family is served notice
, it is the elderly father
, fa zhou
( soon
- tek oh
) who must answer the call
, as there are noone other males in the household
. fearing her father will surely be killed in battle
, fa mulan
( ming
- na wen
) disguises herself as a man
and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army
. mulan
, based on a chineese epic poem
, is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugli duckling
. mulan herself is a disgrace tothe her loving family
, as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman ' s role
,
and inaddition a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband
, we see thta
" grace
" is not oen ofthe her strong points
. very early on
, we are presented with yhe high importance of bringing honor to one ' s family
,
annd by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker
, mulan fails at that task
. by leaving home to fight in her father ' s place
, she may nto only spare his life
,
but bring honor
, too
. as is tje case with most disney musicals
, the songs are first rate
and pervasive throughout the film
. i ' m not sure if they iwll get much airplay
,
but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time
. both lea salonga
, who provides the singing voice for mulan
,
and donny osmond who sings for shang
, the captain of mulan ' s army unit
and obligatory love interest
, are more than competent
,
although salonga ' s voice translates much better to animation
. you have to hear it to understand
. interestingly
, the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan
. there is noone significantly big number
, which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film
,
but this does nto detract significantly fomr the rest of the movie
. it is
,
however
, an expectation which has beeen built by disney ' s own formulaic history
,
anbd some viewers may feel as if something is missing
. artistically
, the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork
,
and
although this may not live up to yhe vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works
, it helps to contribute a more authentic
,
and therefore more credible
, nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically
" disneyfied
" ethnic tale
. there are also a couple of visually standout scenes
, one involving the charge of shan
- yu ' s hun army
, which utilizes the same computer
- enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty
and the beast
. thte other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it
. whn mulan resolves to take her father ' s place
, she dons her father ' s old battle armor
,
and unsheathes a sword
. as she does so
, you can see her reflection inthe the polished metal
. it just left me thinking
,
" that was realyl cool
.
" a wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film
, varing from the straight
, such as soon
- tek oh as fa zhou
, to the comical
, such as harvey fierstein as yao
, a gruff
, pugilistic member ofthe shang ' s conscripted army
. even more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu
, the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan
.
although an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams inwhich aladdin
, murphy neverthless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance
. i found the choice of b
. d
. wong as shang a little stange
( you may remember him as martin short ' s wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride
)
,
but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty
and the beast
, so i guess anything ' s possible
. in any event
, wong performs admirably as well
. one character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa
. she deserves recognition not onyl because of thge levity she brings to the movei
,
but also because she is voiced by twpo very remarkable people
. june foray
, who supplies grandmother fa ' s speaking voice
, isnt a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel
and natasha fatale
( as in boris
and natasha
)
. marni nixon
, who provides granmother fa ' s singing voice
, is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king
and i
, maria in west side story
,
adn eliza in my fair lady
. with this in mind
, hearing grandmother fa is like listening to a little piece ofthe histroy
. mulan is the latest disney animated feature to git away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films
. in an effort to be culturally sensitive
(
and to avoid a
" miss saigon
"
- type debacle
)
, disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asian
- american actors for both lead
and supporting roles
. in addition to the actors already mentioned
, the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong
, gedde watanabe
, james shigeta
,
and george takei
. i guess clyde kusatsu wasn ' t available
. at a running time of slightly under an hour
adn a half
, mulan moves quickly
and provides solid enteratinment fo both children
and
, happily
, adults
. htis is the kind of disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do next
, rather than hope that the next one is better
.
