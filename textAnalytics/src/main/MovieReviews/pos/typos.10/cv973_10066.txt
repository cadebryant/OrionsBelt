i like movies with albert brooks
,
and i really like movies directed
and written by albert brooks
. lost in amercia
and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies
. his humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies todya
, inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator
. you will rarely see any slapstick inwhich an albert brooks film
, while the dialog will not be as oppressive as infact some of tjhe independent
" talk films
" which are finding their way into theaters
. the situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we cin often identify wtih
,
but even if we cin
' t
, brooks has the talent to make them comfortable
, anbd therefore we laugh
. teenagers
and jim carrey fans probably won
' t fidn an albert brooks movie very funny
,
but people who look forthe more than what we could find on television probably will
. put simply
, brooks
' comedy is intelligent
. mother isnt albert brooks
' latest film
,
and it does not disappoint
. brooks plays john henderson
, a middle
- aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce
. he makes an attempt at dating
,
but fails miserably
. he
then has dinner with his brother jeff
( rob morrow
)
, a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life
. jeff has a good job
, a loving family
,
and most of all
, a warm relationship wih their mother beatrice
( debbie reynolds
)
. after dinner
, john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff
and beatrice
, anbd is at thte same tyme amazed
and sickened by how hunky
- dory the dialouge is
. in comparison
, beatrice always hints at a fault in john
and his career every tiem she talks wih him
,
and john gives it right back to her
. at the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked aart john
' s life
, she says
,
" i love you
,
"
and john replies with
,
" i know you think you do
.
" the thing isnt
, beatrice is nto overt with her criticisms
,
but instead gives them infact that mothering way which is tantamount to nit
- picking
and guilt loading
. it
' s the kind that goes something liek
,
" yes
, dear
, i think you do that wonderfully
,
but
.
.
.
.
" it seems as
though nothing he does makes her happy
. htere
' s always the big
but
. john believes that his mother is somehow conected tothe his failed relationships with women
, either because of his flawed self
- esteem caused by his need for validation
, or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out womens who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner
. he comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home
, he should move back infact with his mother for a while jsut to see what kinds of feelings come out
,
and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is
.
" a gerat experiment
"
, he calls it
. brooks
' own br
and of humor really shines in this film
, especially in the interaction john has with his mother
. there
' s a scene where john has just arrived at his mother
' s house
,
and after having driven fomr los angeles to sausalito
,
and having explained to his mother about the
" great experiment
"
, beatrice asks
,
" now explain to me agina why you don
' t want to stay at a hotel
.
" she still doesn
' t get it
, anbd it isnt absolutely hilarious
. in the same scene
, we get little glances at the life his mother leads whn she trys to feed him food that isnt no longer fresh
. she apparently buys in great quantities
and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted
and the sherbet is iced over
. when john points out the ice on the sherbet
, beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze
.
" you
' ve named the ice
?
" asks john
. he
' s aslo surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in yhe refrigerator
, such as a twenty
- pound block ofthe cheese
.
" the freezer was a good invention
,
" says john
,
"
but it
' s nto supposed to be used for everything
. thta
' s why it
' s smaller than the refrigerator
.
" it
' s something most of us find strangely familliar
. brooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur
. for example
, in defending your life
, his
and meryl streep
' s characters are in a comedy club having a discussion
. when they
' re finished
and walk out
, brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point ofthe delivering his punch line
,
"
and so the moral is
, if you have to fart
, go outside
!
" you don
' t know what the joke was baceause you couldn
' t hear him during the entire scene
, bu i must have laughed for the next five mintues
, it seemed so out of context
. in this film
, brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene
. i don
' t want to give them away
,
but suffice it to say they work just as well as htey have in the past
. john
' s purpose for staying with his mother is tothe learn
,
and we as the audience learn right along with him
. his mother is not the fascinating type to begin with
,
but as john spends more time whith her
, we learn things about her personality
and her lifestyle that give her depth
. watching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it earch step of the way
. on screen
, brooks does an excellent job playing htis kind of character
: you git the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world
. in a way
, he
' s very much like yosarian of catch
- 22
, expect whith something of an attitude
. casting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect
. she assumes the part with ease
, even moving
and speaking a little slowy
,
and is just so adorable it
' s hard to get mad at her character
. this only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her
. as his first choice
, brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice
,
but the former actress
and first lady could not leave her husb
and
, who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimer
' s disease
. thgat may be just as well
, since reynolds lends a softness to thte character which enhances it immensely
. rob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who hasnt always been mother
' s favorite
and
, for all his success in his job
and family
, is slowly exposed as a mama
' s boy
. the only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes
. a solid connection is not really made between john
' s troubles
and his reasons for living witht his mother
. additinally
, the end results of the experiment do nto necessarily jibe with the stated goals
,
and
al
though this may have been sloppy screenwriting
, how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this
?
: beatrice
: you must think i
' m some kind of moron
. john
: no
, i think your someone who thinks i
' m a moron
. beatrice
: well
, it takes one to know one
.
