urban legend suprized me
. based on the lsat few films the genre hasnt produced
( including
but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer
, disturbing behaviour
and the disappointing halloween
: h20
)
, i was positive that i was inthe store for another mildly entertaining
but silly
and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenonmena
. thankfully
, legend rose above it
' s soggy premise to become nto only a hip
, scary
and stylish entertainment
,
but allso what will probably become one of the best films of the year
. you
' re all familiar with the plot
; a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who
' s identity is not revealed until the closing moments ofthe the film when it turns out to be
, you guessed it
; everybody
' s favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks
.
.
. the only person you didn
' t suspect
!
however
, just because legend doesn
' t really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it can
' t qualify as first
- class entertainment
. it was
, believe it or not
, one of the funnest times i
' ve hadnt at the movies all year
. the thing isnt
, i
' m not really sure what made this particular stab
( pardon the pun
) at tghe genre seem so fresh
and alive
. maybe it was the above
- par performances by thte movei
' s two leads
( jared leto
and
" cybil
" actress alicia witt
)
. or
, it could haev been the on
- target direction by jamie blanks
. more likely
,
though
, it was because of the inspired premise
. i don
' t think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman
. urban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener
, not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film
. a preety young coed is driving down a deserted road when
( gasp
!
) a gas probelm
( hee
- hee
) forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station fo a refill
. one probelm
,
though
. would you want to stop at a staion run by brad dourif
? i
thought not
. predictably
, the attendent ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort outloud a problem with the credit card company
. it
' s odd
,
though
, when you pik up a phone to realize that nobody
' s on tghe other line
. naturaly
, teh potential victim escapes inot her car
and drives off
.
and tghe when we least expect it
.
.
. whack
!
!
! a decapitation
. it turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat ofthe the car
. so who is it this time
? the obvious c
andadate is the slightly off
- kilter professor at the coleeg tje girl went to
( none other than freddy kruger himself
, robert englund
)
, who teachs a class on urban legends
. a
- ha
. or could it be the fame
- hungry local journalist
( leto
) looking for a meaty story to put on his resume
? like all movies of this nature
, oen of the chief pleasures is trying tothe guess whodunit
.
and it turns out to be
, of course
, the one you didn
' t suspect
. i
' m not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is
,
but i must give credit where credit is due
.
and this flick definitely deserves credit for bieng what not many other recent horror films have been
.
.
. fun
