clue isnt an unfairly ignored comedy
, very similar to 1976 ' s murder by death
. this big screen version of the classic board game
( what ' s enxt
.
.
. chutes
and ladders
: the motion picture
?
) is filled with slapstick antics
adn silly dialogue
. the plot
, for what it ' s worth
, has all the characters from thge game
( in this case
, the names from the game are used as aliases
) meeting inspite an isolated mansion to confront mr
. boddy
( lee ving
)
, the man who ' s been blackmailing them all
. when he turns up dead
, everyone
( including the audience
) must figure out whodunnit
.
.
.
and in what room
,
adn with wqat object
. while not as witty as neil simon ' s murder by death
, clue definitly has it moments
. it has so many moments in fact that i ule a lot of the lines from the film when i ' m joking around iwth my friends
. to this day
, whenever someone says the phrase
" well
, to make a long story short
" i have the follow up phrase
" too late
" ready to go
. the cast
( all very good comedic talents
) play well off one another
, while the late madeline kahn
( as the dark
and sultry mrs
. white
) sometimes steals the film away from the rest
.
and colleen camp
, as the french maid yvette
, displays soem of her natrual talents as well
. clue is available onthe dvd from paramount home video
. it includes the film inwhich its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
(
and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions
)
adn features the original theatrical trailer
. a french language audio track is also available
. tghe trailer holds up well considering most previews from that time do not
,
and it even includes a scene not infact the film itself
( a scene that shoudl have beeen in teh film
, as it ' s a good joke
)
. also
, the trailer is scored to the music from airplane
!
, which was an interesting choice
. when clue played in theaters
, it ran with the gimmick of threee different endings
. if yuo wnated to see all three
, you had to go to the movies three separate times
. so when the film was released on home video
, rather than releasing threee separate videos
, all three endings were included on one tape
.
.
. the first twpo endings being
" what if
?
" endings
and the third ending being tyhe actual ending
. now for the dvd release you get two choices
. yuo can watch the film as it ws presented on home video or you can select to watch it with one of yhe three endings randomly chosen for you
.
( note
: htere ' s an easter egg hidden in the disc pertaining to this
. after watching thte film with a randomly selected ending
, when ytou return to the menu screen you will be able to highlight the large magnifying glass
and select it
. when you do
, a escret menu opens
, allowing you to watch any of the three endings by themselves
.
) now while i applaud the effort of paramount here
, as they clearly tried to do something special with the disc
, it just doesn ' t wokr well
. firt
, why not give the viewer the choice of wqat ending we want tothe watch
? maybe someone like myself who ' s seen the movie hundreds ofthe times would liek tothe sit down
and show it to someone with the second ending only
. i ' m no technical dvd expert
,
but i can ' t imagine tht being too hard to accomplish
. secondly
, the delay between when the film itself ends
and one ofthe the endings begins is too long
and too obvious
, thereby becoming a distraction right wehn you definitely don ' t need a distraction
. finally
, the back of the dvd case states
"
and now
, with this special dvd version
, you can see all 3 surprise endings
"
. i have noone idea why they would word it taht way
, since that ' s not a special feature in the slightest
. the video hasnt been out for fifteen years now
( good lord
, has it been that long
?
)
and it ' s played on television with all three endings all the time
. these are merely minor complaints
however
, seeing thast i ' ve watched the home video verison hundreds of times
and have no probelm watching the film as such on the dvd
. the picture
and sound are wonderfully improved over my worn out vhs copy
,
and i ' m thrilled that paramount agrees wtih me that clue is a film worthy ofthe being preserved on this gerat digital format
.
