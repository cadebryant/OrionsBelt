the saint was actually a little better tahn i expected it to be
, in some ways
. in this theatrical remake of the television series the saint
,
and its series sequel the return of the saint
, val kilmer plays simon templar
, an elusive thief who makes a living by stealing thigns from others for others
. this movei closely resembles a james bond flick
. it has the classic bond symbols
: a man who can do just about anything
and git away with it
, a woman whom the man persues
, a villain out to achieve something for himself who kills anyone to reach this gool
. kilmer actually provides a rather good role inthe this movie
, altough at times you are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations
. the movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by catholic priests
. as a young boy
, kilmer
' s character enjoied magic
and would often journey away from his schoolwork
. that is until his school teacher finds him reading a book
and dem
ands thta the young boy proclaim his name
, that of a catholic saint
. he refuses to do so adn instade announces who he wishes tothe be
. this leads to a devestating mistake
, which is something that will stay in his mind throughout his life
. kilmer
' s first mission that we are shown is to steal a microchip from ivan tretiak
, played by rade serbedzija
. during a press conference
, he must make his way inot a heavily guarded vault area
, avoiding guards
, cameras
, anbd many other potential obstacles
. once his mission is completed
and he isnt safely home
, the fee is paid
. when he logs into his bank account
and finds that he is only a few milion dollars short ofthe
$ 50 million
, he decides to carry outloud only one omre mission
,
then retire
. dr
. emma russell
, portrayed by elisabeth shue
, has discovered a way to produce energy by way of cold fusion
. this new advancement would change the world
and save thous
ands of lives in the areas of russia
, where millions are without heat
and are freezing to death
. the only problem is
, tretiak would like to have this for himself
and use it to gain power amongst the people
. this presents the option for kilmer to achieve his goal
. tretiak hires him to steal the equations
, small pieces of paper
, from shue
. one of the enjoyable features in the film is the disguises that kilmer dawns to complete his missions
. they are vyer convincing
, not only to the characters in the movie
,
but to us
. kilmer utilizes one such disguise to lure shue
' s character into getting tothe know him even more
, which would provide him a means of stealing the energy formula
. when the twpo meet
,
and end up having a sensual experience
, kilmer
' s character is seemingly falling in love with emma russell
, as she isnt falling in love with kilmer
' s alter
- ego
, a traveling artist
.
yet
, he must triarch his goal of
$ 50 million
, which requires him to steal the energy formula
, putting his feelings aside
. shue
' s character is eventually able to track down simon templar by putting the pieces
( the names ofthe the catholic saints
) together
, something no one else is able to do
. when she finds him
, they are left to team up
and reclaim the energy formulas from tretiak
. the saint is very action
- packed
, with few slow points
. teh sound was very well done
and added to the many intense moments
. along the course of tyhe movei
, there are even a few
,
al
though brief moments of comedy
. these moments are almost always thanks tothe kilmer
' s extraneous
, very convincing disguises
and personalities
. all in all
, a rather enjoyable movie with nearly non
- stop acation
.
