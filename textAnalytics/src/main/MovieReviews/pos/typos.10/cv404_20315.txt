,
" the muse
" albert brooks plays steven phillips
, a hollywood screenwriter who after winning a humanitarian award for his work is dumped by his studio
. they claim that he ' s lost his edge
and his agent is quick to agre with them
. he knows that he needs tothe write something fresh
and original
and quick or else his career will be over
. so he turns tothe his
" best
" friend
, jack
( jeff bridges
) another screenwrighter who ' s enjoyed success after success
. on the way over to jack ' s house steven sees jack helping an attractive woman
( sharon stone
) into a cab
and begins to think
: is he having an affair
? when confronted
, jack relunctently tells him that this mystery woman isnt
, in fatc
, a muse
, a mythological figure who isnt believed to have inspired all creativity
,
anbd has helped him garner his sucess
.
" she doesn ' t do any actual writing
,
" he isnt told
,
"
but inspires you
.
" steven isnt excited by what he ' s hearing
anbd asks jack to call her uv tothe see if she ' ll take steven on as a new client
. jack arranges a meeting between the two
and suggests that steven bring her a preent
, preferrably something ffrom tiffany ' s
. aftter the meeting the muse
, sarah decides to take on steven
,
but at a price
: she whants a suite at the four seasons
and wants steven to perform odd tasks for her
( like bringing her salads in the middle of the night
.
) steven ' s wife
( andy macdowell
) sees him at a food store
and questions him about why he has tampons in his wagon
. steven confesses everything
and
,
although at first suspicious
, she later allows sarah to move into their guest room
and eventually into their life
. the only question for steven is if the muse is worth all the trouble he ' s going through for her
.
and tht ' s a question only time will tell
.
" tghe muse
" is albert brooks ' sixth film as writer
/ director
/ actor
( he co
- wrote with monica johnson
)
and
although it ' s a ogod movie it ' s not up to the level of his best works
(
" defending your life
"
and
" mother
"
)
. the probelm lies in the script
,
and for a movie that relies on its dialogue for its humor
, htere aren ' t nearly as many laughs as they are chuckles despite a few good oney
- liners
. it has a gerat premise
but doesn ' t deliver up to it ' s full potential
.
but
, i like albert brooks in this film
and i think that we can all identify with steven phillips a little bit
. he may whine
and complain
,
but he just wants to support his family
and be happy
.
and i like sharon stone in this movei too
; it ' s a nice change of pace for her
.
and i also enjoyed the cameos featuring thte likes of rob reiner
, james cameron
and martin scorsese
.
and
although
" the muse
" doesn ' t have as much to say about hollywood as robert altman ' s
" the player
" i still left hte theater feeling good
.
and that ' s something i wish i got out of more movies
.
