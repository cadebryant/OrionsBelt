" the muse
" albert brooks plays steven phillips
, a hollywood screenwriter who after winning a humanitarian award for his work is dumped by his studio
. tehy claim that he
' s lost his edge
and his agent is quick to agree with them
. he knows that he needs to write something fresh
and original adn quick or else his carreer will be over
. so he turns to his
" best
" friend
, jack
( jeff bridges
) another screenwriter who
' s enjoyed success after success
. on the way over to jack
' s house steven sees jack helping an attractive woman
( sharon stone
) into a cab
and begins to think
: is he having an affair
? when confronted
, jack relunctently tells him that this mystery woman is
, in fact
, a muse
, a mythological figure who is believed to have inspired all creativity
,
and has helpped him garner his success
.
" she doesn
' t do any actual writing
,
" he is told
,
"
but inspires you
.
" steven is excisted by what he
' s hearing
and asks jack to call her up to see if she
' ll take steven on as a new client
. jack arranges a meeting between the two
and suggests that steven bring her a presnt
, preferably something from tiffany
' s
. after the meeting tghe muse
, sarah decides to take on steven
,
but at a price
: she wants a suite at the four seasons
and wants steven to perform odd tasks for her
( like bringing her salads in the middle of the night
.
) steven
' s wief
(
andy macdowell
) sees him at a food store
and questions him about why he has tampons inaddition his wagon
. steven confesses everything
and
,
al
though at first suspicious
, she later allows sarah to move inot their guest room
and eventually into theri life
. the only question for steven is if the muse is worth all the trouble he
' s going through for her
.
and that
' s a question only time will tell
.
" the muse
" isnt albert brooks
' sixth film as writer
/ director
/ actor
( he co
- wrote with monica johnson
)
and
al
though it
' s a good movie it
' s not up to the level of his best works
(
" defending your life
" annd
" mother
"
)
. the problem lies in the script
,
and for a movei that relies on its dialogue fo its humor
, htere aren
' t nearly as many laughs as they are chuckles despite a few good oney
- liners
. it hasnt a great premise
but doesn
' t deliver up to it
' s full potential
.
but
, i like albert brooks in this film
and i thikn that we can all identify with steven phillips a little bited
. he may whine adn complain
,
but he just wants tothe support his family
and be happy
.
and i like sharon stone in this movie too
; it
' s a nice change ofthe pace for her
. adn i also enjoyed the cameos featuring the likes ofthe rob reiner
, james cameron
and martin scorsese
.
and altho
" the muse
" doesn
' t have as much to say about hollywood as robert altman
' s
" the player
" i still left the theater feeling good
.
and that
' s something i wish i got out of more movies
.
