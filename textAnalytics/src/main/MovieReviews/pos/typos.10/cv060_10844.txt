after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film
, you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again
. there is a scene where an ood man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles
, as a master would teach an eager apprentice
.
" you caress the noodles with the chopsticks
,
" he says
,
"
then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl
and apologize to it by saying
, ' see you soon
. '
" of course
, it ' s meant to be a parody
,
but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety
. you begin to apprieciate the food as not mearly something you eat
, not something you like
, nto something ytou enjoy
,
but rather something you experience
. experiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses
, fulfilling each oney on its pwn terms
and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts
. trust me
, you realy want to go find a noodle shop at this point
. juzo itami ' s tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody ofthe food to the forefront by makeing the story followup the pattern of an american western
, set in modern day japan
. a stranger
, goro
( tsutomu yamazaki
)
, comes into town
and finds tampopo
( nobuko miyamoto
)
, the proprieter of a small
, hole
- in
- the
- wall noodle shop
, trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman
, pisken
( rikiya yasuoka
)
. goro
, tothe defend the hounour of thsi woman
and her noodles
, gets into a fight with the ringleader
and his henchmen
, emerging bloodied
,
but victorious
. goro finds that tampopo ' s ambition is to hvae a shop that people would flock to from far away
, just to eat a bowl of her ramen
. the problem is
, her fare is something less than popular
,
and less than appetizing
.
however
, goro agrees to help tampopo inthe her quest
,
and in thge process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert
, enlist the aid ofthe a wealthy patron
,
and make friends with the former enemy
. thsi film is filled wtih many little scenes which are absolute gems
. take
, for exmaple
, when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner
. the price is too high
,
but thte owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum
. tampopo meets him at his stoer late at night
,
annd he leads her to a back room
. she protests
, thinking that perhasp this man hasnt ulterior motives
,
but he insists
. just whn she is baout to bolt for the exit
, he shows her a small gap in tyhe wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door
. she peers through
and takes notes as she watches the cook amke the soup forthe the next day
, her face filled with a joy that can be feeled by the audience
. this scene
, hwile comical
, is vrey effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation
,
then of relief
and dicovery
. ther ' s also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo
and her son to a bunch of street people who
, despite theri economic trappings
, are all gourmets
and master sommeliers
. we even watch as one of them sneaks inot the kitchen ofthe a restaurant
and expertly prepares a french omelet
. the scene is meaned to bring a laff
,
but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor
, food is something which everyone has in common
,
and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all
. there are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film
, which help to illistrate
and accentuate the role of fodo in peopel ' s lives
. a particularly effective oney involves a wife
and mother being tended to inthe her home by a doctor
. surrounded by her children
, she is obviously in her last ohurs of life
. her husband comes home
,
and seeing her worsened condition
, demands that she get up
adn make dinner
. the viewer knows the husband ' s intention is not tothe be mean
; he is desperate for the normalcy of which he
and his family has obviously been deprived
,
and the wife making dinner isnt an essential part of this
. in a near miracle
, thte wife drags herself to the kitchen
and prepares a quick meal
,
hten brings it to her awaiting famaly
. as the family eats
, she looks on them
and smiles
. preparing food for her family is a joy
and a comfort to her
,
and for a brief moment
, she too enjoys the normalcy
.
then she falls over
, dead
. for a moment
, the family is stunned
,
but
hten the father yells at the children
,
" keep eating
! this isnt the last meal your mother ever made
!
" crying as they do so
, the family finishes the meal
. the scene is comical
, awkward
, moving
,
and beautiful
. by includng the vignettes
, itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film
,
but surprisingly
, htey do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline
. instead
, they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo ' s goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy
and even noble
. because the film parodies a western
, the construction of the plot is fairly predictable
,
but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the
" good guys
" come together for the final showdown
. in this case
, the showdown isnt against the ramen
. if they eat tampopo ' s ramen
, soup
and all
, tampopo knows she has succeeded
. it ' s pretty obvious what the outcome will be
,
bu when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life
, ytou can afford to cut it a little slack
.
