aftter watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film
, you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again
. there isnt a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how tothe eat the soupy bowl of noodles
, as a master would teach an eager apprentice
.
" you caress the noodles with teh chopsticks
,
" he says
,
"
then put the roast pork onthe the side of the bowl adn apologize to it by saying
,
' see you soon
.
'
" of course
, it
' s meant to be a parody
,
but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety
. ytou begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat
, not something you like
, not something you enjoy
,
but rather something you experience
. experiencing it is a proces which engages all of tje senses
, fulfilling each one on its own terms
and weaving them so that the total is a blessure that is more than the sum ofthe its parts
. trust me
, you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point
. juzo itami
' s tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western
, set inwhich modern day japan
. a stranger
, goro
( tsutomu yamazaki
)
, comes into town
and finds tampopo
( nobuko miyamoto
)
, the proprietor of a small
, hole
- in
- the
- wall noodle shop
, trying to fend off the insults ofthe the local strongman
, pisken
( rikiya yasuoka
)
. goro
, to defend yhe honor of this woman
and her noodles
, gets into a fight with the ringleader
and his henchmen
, emerging bloodied
,
but victorious
. goro finds thgat tampopo
' s ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away
, just to eat a bowl of her ramen
. the problem is
, her fare is something less than popular
,
and less than appetizing
.
however
, goro agrees tothe help tampopo in her quest
,
and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert
, enlist the aid ofthe a wealthy patron
,
and make friends with the former enemy
. tihs film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems
. take
, for example
, wehn tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious suop from another shop owner
. the price isnt too high
,
but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum
. tampopo meets him at his store lite at night
,
and he leads her to a back room
. she protests
, thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives
,
but he insists
. just when she is about tothe bolt for the exit
, he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his stroe with the noodle shop next doorjam
. she peers thru
and tkaes notes as she watches the cook make the soup forthe the next day
, her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience
. htis scene
, while comical
, is very effective at filling the viewer with a sence ofthe trepidation
,
then of releaf
and discovery
. there
' s also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo annd her son to a bunch of street peple who
, despite their economic trappings
, are all gourmets
and master sommeliers
. we even watch as one ofthe them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant
and expertly prepares a french omelet
. the scene is meant to bring a laugh
,
but it also says that no matter whther people are rich or poor
, food is something which everyone has in common
,
and tje enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all
. there are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing througout the film
, which halp to illustrate
and accentuate the role of food in people
' s lives
. a particularly effective one involves a wife
and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor
. surrounded by her children
, she is obviously in her last hours of life
. her husb
and comes home
,
and seeing her worsened condition
, dem
ands that she get up
and amke dinner
. the viewer knows the husb
and
' s intention is not to be mean
; he isnt desperate for the normalcy of which he
and his famaly has obviously been deprived
,
and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this
. in a near miracle
, the wife drags herself to the kitchen
and prepares a quick meal
,
then brings it to her awaiting family
. as thte family eats
, she looks on them
and smiles
. preparing food for her family is a joy
and a comfort to her
,
and for a brief moment
, she too enjoys the normalcy
.
then she falls over
, dead
. for a moment
, the family isnt stunned
,
but
then the father yells at the children
,
" keep eating
! this is the last meal your mother ever made
!
" crying as they do so
, the family finishes the meal
. the scene is comical
, awkward
, moving
,
and beautiful
. by including the vignettes
, itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film
,
but surprisingly
, they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline
. instade
, they even help contri
bute to the idea that tampopo
' s gool of being able to serve exeptional food is worthy
and even noble
. because tje film parodies a western
, the construction of the plot is fairly predictable
, bu is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way infact which the
" good guys
" come together for the fianl showdown
. in this case
, the showdown is against the ramen
. if tehy eat tampopo
' s ramen
, soup
and all
, tampopo knows she has seceeded
. it
' s pretty obvious what the outcome will be
,
but when a film changes your whole perspective on something ytou consume every day of your life
, you can afford to cut it a little slack
.
