forthe those of us who weren
' t
yet born when the 1960
' s rock
' n
' rolled around
, monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies
. from otis redding tothe jimi hendrix
, janis joplin to the mamas
and the papas
,
and jefferson airplane to tyhe who
, this documenatry is jam
- packed with contagious energy
.
but i give fair warning tyhat i will reveal the ending
, which does not do the rest of thge film the justice it deserves
. shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert tyhat precluded woodstock
, the film defies the stereotype of the genaral population at the time
. sure
, some have painted their faces
and smoke joints
,
but d
. a
. pennebaker
( the war room
, moon over broadway
) surprisingly choosed to show a broad spectrum of the audience
. no matter who is watching
, it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul
. the excitement starts before the music even begins
. a young girl is cleaning thous
ands ofthe seats
and when asked why by an interviewer
, she replies thyat she feels lucky to do so
. there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips
, leader of the mamas
and tyhe papas
and one of the concert organizers
, tries tothe get in touch with dionne warwick
.
and when one b
and is tuning up
, a member remarks
,
" finally
, a decent sound system
!
" you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn
' t about vanity
, it
' s about playing the music you love tothe those who have an appreciation for it
, a two
- way street
. this interaction between audience
and performer continues througout tghe film
and becomes infectious to the audience
. it
' s impossible to tear your eyes away fomr janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball
and chain
.
and hwile the lyrics to
" wild thing
" may not be all that complicated
, watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love
. even if you don
' t recognize every b
and you see on stage
, you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats
. the only drawback to the film is the ending
, which unfortunately i must reveal
. all the other b
ands
, big names
then
and still today
, got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time
. in contrast
, the last b
and on camera
, a wholly forgettable one
, gets an entire 18 mintues of screen time
. for a film that
' s only 78 minutes long
, that
' s too large ofthe a chunk
, especially whn previous acts are much moreso stimulating
. all in all
, monterey pop isnt a precious
, rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us
. the variety of music
, as well as the beautifully shot performances
, are easy to become immersed in
. if there was ever any question as to why most of these b
ands were so popular
, this is quickly dispelled
. it
' s almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn
' t get made much anymore
. instade we
' re stuck with
* nsync
, the backstreet boys
,
and jennifer lopez
, all of whom should have stuck with modeling
.
