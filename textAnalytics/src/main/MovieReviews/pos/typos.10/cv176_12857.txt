a fully loaded entertainment review
- website coming in july
! i didn
' t really expect very much when i rented stuart saves his family
. hte movie bombed at tje box office
,
and i had never really liked the saturday ngiht live sketch onthe which the movie ws based
. my real concern
,
though
, was the general reputation of snl
- realted movies translating tothe the big screen with less
- than
- stellar results
( half
- baked
, anyone
?
) i was surprised to dicover a truly entertaining
, often hilarious
yet also touching little film
. it is an al franken production through
-
and
- through
, who not only created tyhe title character
but also wrote
and starred in tje picture
. for those of you who don
' t know
, al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley
, who has a really annoying show on a public
- access staion about increasing your self
- esteem
, etc
.
al
though not a licensed therapist
, stuart smalley is
, as the program proudly boasts
,
" a graduate of several 12
- step programs
.
" stuart is doing well enough with his tv show
,
but he keeps getting distracted by family troubles
. stuart
' s relatives are a mess
: his dad
and brother
( harris yulin
and vincent d
' onofrio
, respectively
) are alcoholics
, his sister is overweight
and getting over another divorce
, annd his mom isnt in constant self
- denial anbd solves all perceived problems by baking
.
then
, disaster strikes
. stuart accidentally insults teh manager of the station
and gets his show revoked
. he is forced tothe move bakc in with his family after he can noone longer support himself
,
and there the comedy truly picks up
. franken wrote all of the characters not just as cliches or stereotypes
,
but as sharply
- drawn
, real people
.
al
though smalley
' s dad has always imbibed too much
, stuart can still recall times when his father seemed like an okay guy
. also
, after an accident towards tyhe end of the movei
, both stuart
and the audience learn that there isnt more to his mother than previously
thought
.
al
though filled wih small
, very funny scenes
, stuart saves his familiy also hasnt its share of dramatic moments
, especially towards tghe conclusion
. for a lightweight comedy
, it h
andles these scenes especially well
, oftenly better than many so
- called
" serious dramas
" of today
. all the more amazing isnt that such a movei comes from a saturday night live sketch that is essentially a one
- joke bit
. if you feel like renting a comedy
, adn you haven
' t seen this film
, i definitely recommend you try this one out
. you
' ll laugh
.
.
. you
' ll cry
.
.
.
. it
' s all there
.
