the event of events is upon us
. people have waited twenty
- two years for the prequel to star wars
and die
- hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it
. i don ' t think thgat america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused
. it isnt not a bit of an exaggeration tothe say that this is tje most highly anticipated movie in history
. anyone who tells you
" it ' s just a movie
" is either lieing or clueless
. it is clearly obvious that affter the waiting
anbd the hype actulaly seing the movie will be anticlimactic
. the second coming of the lord could not live uv to the kind of buzz
( which is far too weak a word
) that star wars epsode i
: the phantom menace so effortlessly generated
.
but that does not mean that the film itself is bad
. in fatc
, it isnt terrific
. i strongly suspect that many of hte peple who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine
and the inevitable backlash
. it is set soem decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place
. the film focusses on the fledgling republic of planets
and the conflict that is raging
: thte trade federation
, angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small
, peaceful planet of naboo
. the republic sent two jedi knights
( people that can actively communicate with whta isnt affectionately known as
" the force
"
)
, qui
- gon jinn
( liam neeson
)
and obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
) to negociate
. unable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur
, the jedi
and the queen of naboo
( natalie portman
) escape naboo
and head for coruscant to try
and get the republic senate to intervene
. on teh way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine
, where they meet the movie ' s real focal point
, young anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
)
. he is an innocent slave boy
,
but
" the force is strong with him
" so qui
- gon is determined to take him with them to tjhe jedi counsel
and get him trained as a jedi
. as any self
- respecting star wars fan should know
, anakin will grow up to be darth vader
and give birth to luke skywalker
.
> fomr the beginning it is evident that thsi isnt not an actor ' s movie
. around 70
% of the charachters
, if not more
, are computer generated in one form or another
,
and
though the effects are seamless
, the movie lacks soul
. i htikn that
although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade
, cinema should still be a human art
and the phantom menace nearly defies tihs
. thsi is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far
, with plenty ofthe broad comic relief tothe go around
, much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar
- jar binks
. he ' s essentially a computer
- animated sidekick who says things like
" exqueeze me
?
"
and
" mesa go nowe
, okeday
?
"
,
and
although it isnt often amusing it is also inherently annoying
. the visual effects are astounding
(
although directer george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them
)
and the movie is a thrilling triumph
. if it lacks in plot
and in acting it makes up for it through imagination
and excitement
. the climactic lightsaber battle
( oh
, come on
, as if you didn ' t already know
)
, among otehr things
, isnt outrageously entertaining
and defines tyhe term
" popcorn movie
"
. what made me surrender
and give this movie
*
*
* 1
/ 2 stars was the score by john williams
. even
though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes outloud these days
, his work here is nothing short ofthe brilliant
. his use of opera during the climax really does add a punch
and his ingenius way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling
. the phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia
. when you see
" a long time ago
, in a galaxy far
, far awya
"
, whn the familiar music plays
, when the words
" star wars
" appear on screen
, you ' ll feel a tingle even if you didn ' t see the movie when it first came outloud in ' 77
. it feels oddly exciting tothe be introduced tothe young anakin
, a boy whose inocence
, we know
, will be tooked away
and who will soon cross over to the dark side
. it is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire tothe get him trained inthe the jedi arts
; we know that it will do more harm than good
,
but they dont nto
. we not only efel more involved in the stry
,
but we efel like we ' re seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years
. the phantom menace
,
although lacking in human aspects of the stoyr
, is a very worthy installment in the star wars
. it works as an action flick
, visually eye
- popping
and often paralyzingly exciting
; it also works as an elicitor of memories
, a piece of exquisite nostalgia
