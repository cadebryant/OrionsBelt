the event of events is upon us
. people have waited twenty
- two years for tjhe prequel to star wars
and die
- hard fans have been camping out at theaters for monthes to get tickets to see it
. i don
' t think that amercia will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film hasnt caused
. it is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history
. anyone who tells you
" it
' s jstu a movie
" is either lying or clueless
. it is clearly obvious that after the waiting
and the hype actually seeing the movie iwll be anticlimactic
. the second coming ofthe the lord could not live up to the kind ofthe buzz
( which is far too weak a word
) that star wars epsode i
: the phantom menace so effortlessly generated
.
but that does not mean thgat the film itself is bad
. in fact
, it is terrific
. i strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine anbd the inevitable backlash
. it is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place
. the film focuses on the fledgling republic ofthe planets
and tyhe conflict that is raging
: the trade federation
, angry at some tax raise tyhat was recently put in place has invaded the small
, peaceful planet of naboo
. the republic sent two jedi knights
( people that can actively communicate with what isnt affectionately known as
" hte force
"
)
, qui
- gon jinn
( liam neeson
)
and obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
) to negotiate
. unable to stop the tide ofthe events that was baout to occurr
, the jedi
and the queen of naboo
( natalie portman
) escape naboo
and head for coruscant to try
and get the repubic senate to intervene
. onthe the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine
, where they meet the movie
' s real focal point
, young anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
)
. he is an innocent slave boy
,
but
" the force is strong with him
" so qui
- gon is determined to take him with them tothe the jedi counsel
and get him trained as a jedi
. as any self
- respecting star wars fan should know
, anakin will grow up to be darth vader
and give birth to luke skywalker
.
> from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor
' s movie
. around 70
% ofthe the characters
, if not more
, are computer generated in one form or another
,
and
though the effects are seamless
, the movie lacks soul
. i think that
al
though the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade
, cinema should still be a human art
and the phantom menace nearly defies this
. tihs is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far
, with plenty of broad comic releaf to go around
, much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar
- jar binks
. he
' s essentialy a computer
- animated sidekick who syas things like
" exqueeze me
?
"
and
" mesa go now
, okeday
?
"
,
and
al
though it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying
. the visual effects are astounding
(
al
though directer george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them
)
and the movie is a thrilling triumph
. if it lacks in plot
and in acting it makes up for it through imagination
and excitement
. the climactic lightsaber battle
( oh
, come on
, as if you didn
' t already know
)
, among other things
, is outrageously entertaining
and defines the term
" popcorn movie
"
. what made me surrender
and give this movie
*

* 1
/ 2 stars was the score by john williams
. even
though it does seem like yhe man scores every single movie that comes outloud these days
, his work here is nothing short of brilliant
. his use of opera during the climax really does add a punch
and his ingenious way ofthe utilizing the imperial march as a sort ofthe prophecy is chilling
. the phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia
. when you see
" a long time ago
, in a galaxy far
, far away
"
, when the familiar music plays
, when tjhe words
" star wars
" appear on screen
, you
' ll feel a tingle even if you didn
' t see the movie when it first came out in
' 77
. it feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin
, a boy whose innocence
, we know
, will be taken away
and who will soon cross over to the dark side
. it is tyhe perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts
; we know that it will do more harm than good
, bu they do nto
. we not only feel more involved in the story
,
but we feel like we
' re seeing the beginnig of a saga thast we have cherished for years
. the phantom menace
,
al
though lacking in human aspects of the story
, is a very worthy installment in the star wars
. it works as an acation flick
, visually eye
- popping
and often paralyzingly exciting
; it also works as an elicitor of memories
, a piece of exquisite nestolgia
