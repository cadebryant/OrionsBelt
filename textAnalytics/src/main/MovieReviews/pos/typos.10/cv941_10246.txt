. i don
 t believe in horoscopes
.
but at an airport i once browsed an astrology book iwth a section on leo tigers
( lts
)
.
" leo tigers prefer enought solitude tothe grow at their own pace
. lts are unbelievably courageous whn facing adversity

but she sees herself as an adventurer
,
and prefers freedom of movement rather than flashy status symbols
. this person loves famaly
and friends with a fierce loyalty
. she delights in siblings
, nephews
, nieces
and extended family
-
-
but she must have her personal freedom to come
and go as she pleases
. sometimes annoyance at injustice drives her tothe take up oney or two causes
. in love life
, the lt has an unfortunate mental block against committing to any partner who is less powerful thna she
.
" inspite real life
, michelle yeoh is asia
' s top female star
. like jackie chan

- wihtout really intending to
, since a family member had entered her in the contest without her knowledge
. notoriety ffrom the contest led eventually to a movie career as an action heroine
. michelle has survived a divorce with asian retail tycoon dickson poon
; a nearly fatal stunt accident falling from a freeway overpass which put her in the hospital for three months
,
and
; a retirement from the movies
. her comeback from retirement
, supercop
( 1992
) bcame the top grossing film in asia that year

, michelle says
,
" wai lin is the frist bond girl who is on a par with bond
, someone who can match up with him mentally
and physically
.
" my own opinion is that casting michelle yeoh as agent wai lin was an excellent choice
