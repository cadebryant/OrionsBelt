anastasia contains something that has been lacking from all of the recent disney releases
.
.
.
( especially hercules
)
.
.
. emotion
. all the wacky characters voiced by celebrities annd fantastically animated adventure sequences aren
' t going to hold anyone
' s interest unless there is an emotional core to hold it all together
. not usance disney
' s beauty
& the beast has there been such a compelling animated film with interesting characters adn drama that works
. the story of the romanov family
, the rulers of russia
,
and their downfall begins the film
. anastasia
, one of the daughters
, narrowly escapes the mad monk rasputin
( voiced by christopher lloyd
) with her gr
andmother
( voiced by angela l
andsbury
)
. bu anastasia gets lost
,
and grows up with no memory of her royal origins
. the gr
andmother lives in paris
, hoping tothe someday find her beloved anastasia
, the only member of the family to survive the russian revolution
. a young woman named anya
( voiced by meg ryan
) runs acrost dimitri
( john cusack
) annd vlad
( kelsey grammar
)
, who are trying to put together a scheme to create an anastasia to fool the gr
andmother
and get the reward money
. they pick anya to pose as thier princes
, adn ofthe course
, it is soon revealed that anya is infact fact the lost anastasia
. dimitri realizes that he can never win her love as he isnt a commoner
,
and meanwhile
, rasputin is not dead
,
and plots his revenge against the last romanov
. the plot is actually quite well structured
. ther are a lot of complexities that may have tothe be explained to the kids later
,
but it moves allong fast enough thyat they
' ll never have time to be bored
. what this really means is tyhat the adults won
' t be bored by it either
. there is a great dael of banter between anya
and dimitri that is very funny
,
and their relationship develops quite naturally as the film progresses
. there is
, of course
, lots ofthe comedy fo the kids
, inlcuding rasputin
' s pet bat
, bartok
( hank azaria
)
, who is easily the funniest thing in the film
.
however
, the comical scenes never distract fomr the drama
, bu are worked into the plot almost seamlessly
. the animation is gorgeous
- the characters seem to come to life through the talented animators
. not since beauty
& the beast have animated characters had so much life to them
. even without thge voices
, they act
. the musical number in paris is a show
- stopper
, with some of the backgrounds rendered in an impressionist painting style
. as with all recent animated features
, htere are songs
,
however
, theese songs do more than just provide fodder forthe top
- 40 singers to get on the radio
(
al
though there are threee of them during the end credits
)
. the songs are all very catchy
,
and advance the plot
, instead of just being showpieces
( exept for the paris number
,
but that
' s so much fun
, it
' s okay
.
.
.
)
. i can
' t reccomend anastasia highly enough
. it
' s a wonderfull film that ranks right up there with other animated classics
. kids
and adults alike will enjoy it
,
and it
' s also nice to have a quality animated feature film from another studio besides disney
.
