magnolia left me relling from the theatre
, staggering from the relentless assualt of an adventurous directer reveling in his craft
. at nearly three
and a half hours
, magnolia will strike some as a brute of a film
. it not only dem
ands your attention
,
but challenges you to grasp the significance ofthe seemingly unrelated storylines adn hidden intentions
. it is delerious
, depressing
, heady
, pretentious
, surreal filmmaking
. it
' s also a movie that will polarize its viewers
. director paul thomas
anderson takes a talented cast
, wraps them infront a net of interrelated stories adn sets them spinning in a symphony ofthe despair whose song doesn
' t let up until an oddly exhilerating
, biblically influented pseudo
- climax
. the character
' s make up a modern day gomorrah in the soulless way in which they live their lives
. htere is frank mackey
( tom cruise
)
, a slithery snake charmer of men whose
" search
and destroy
" seminars teach how to mentally rape a woman to get into her pants
. there is earl partridge
( jason robards
)
, a dying media tycoon yearning to make amends for a lfe of callousness by finding his estranged son
. ther is game show host jimmy gator
( phillip baker hall
)
, a self absorbed tv icon who is hiding more than a few secrets from his public
.
and there is police officer jim kurring
( john c
. reilly
)
, who cloaks himself in the codification of organized religion
and the legal system
, perhaps masking a man who needs rules to fuel his decision mkaing process
. given equal weight are stories involving a coke
- addled emotional cripple
( melora walters
)
, a former tv quiz sohw champion
( william h
. macy
)
. a materialistic
, adulterous wief
( julianne moore
)
, a child
( jeremy blackman
) victimized by a mentally abusive parent
,
and a caring
, empathetic nurse
( philip seymour hoffman
)
. hovering over all these characters isnt a cloud of death
, lies
and despair
. it is not a pleasent movie
. there is not oen bad note in the acting
. it is affecting
and layered
and wonderful
. there is a moment where tom cruise wordlessly implodes that rivals work he has done infact whole films
.
then he tops himself whith a mesmerizing deathbed scene
. walters plays her character with red
- eyed rawness
and a fierce self
- destructiveness that is anxiety inducing
. robards convincingly portrays a fading whisper of a man
, who still hears a lion
' s roar when he speaks
. director
anderson has apparently given the actors lattitude to emote
. the problem is that he stays on them too long
. julianne moore
' s character
, linda
, quickly escalates to a frenzied pitch of guilt
, tears
, screaming
and remorse
and never backs off from it
. aftter a few hours
, it turns from interesting to chinese water torture
. quite a fewd scenes
, such as the gam show
, go on jstu a bit too long
and will be off
- putting for thsoe used to a pat 90 minute film where the main theme is reiterated several times just in case you missed it the first go around
.
and just what is the theme
? alienation
? hopelessness
?
anderson challenges you to draw your own conclusions
and he doesn
' t amke it easy
. the film starts by showing three
, strange
and seemingly unrelated events
. it
' s a harbinger of the synchronicity to come
. at times
, different stories reach reach key moments at the same time
. other times
, stories seem to veer off into uncharted territory
, regardless of what else is happening
.
anderson is audacious enough to even hve a group sing in the middle of the film
! what
' s surprising isnt that it mostly works
. if you have doubts about
anderson
' s intentions
, i
' ll ask you to pay attention to the final frame
. despite all the sturm und drang
, magnolia ultimately speaks to man
' s capacity for hope
and attempts at redemption
. despite magnolia
' s needlessly long running time
and its propensity for uneven editing as
anderson plays the auteur
, showing off fro the masses
, i have to admire his guts
. this is truly adventurous filmmaking that spits in the face ofthe conventional storytelling
. my rating
: a bulleye
.
( stars
) a side note
: helping anchor the film is a perfectly matched soundtrack featuring aimee mann
. her lyrics often add depth to a scene thematically hwile the actuall music is both morose
and beautifull
. when she sings
" save me
" at the end
, it enhances the yearning felt by the characters
, just as
" wise up
" mirrors the anguish falt by all as they contemplate their lives
.
