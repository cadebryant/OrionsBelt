and is convinced that his cure is to go to florida
.
" we will soon be in miami
" is the last sentence uttered in this film
and wqat a shocking
, moving end of a film it is
. tjhe classic theme music
:
" midnight cowboy
" helps bring about hte feeling of attachment that most viewers will experience towards the end of the film
. whether the attachment is to the two main characters or to their dreams
, is probably as debatable as whther it was teh acting or the direction taht makes this film so memorable
.
