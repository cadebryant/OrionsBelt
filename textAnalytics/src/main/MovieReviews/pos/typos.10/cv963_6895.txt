i can hear the question already
. waht on earth do these two movies have in common
? to most people
, not a lot
, except that both are by renowned directors
. as i saw them
, howver
, both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers
.
but oh
, how differently the packages affect their films
. while
" everyone
' s
" production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special
, jane campion
' s imaginative visuals only serve tothe emphasize how pompous anbd uninvolving laura jones
' script is
. i left
" everyone sasy i love you
" not remembering a lot about who loved whom
, bu its infectious happiness put a grin on my face
. i left
" the portrait of a lady
" not remembering a lot about who loved whom
,
and i sould haev cared less
.
" everyone
" features nothing allen hasn
' t done before storywise
. woody is again desperately in love with a beautiful woman
( roberts
)
,
and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrong
-
- again
. similar situations happen to his family
and friends
. some ofthe the more outl
andish comedy scenes even hark back tothe his
" early
, funny
" films
. the scenes between tim roth
and drew barrymore could have come out of
" tkae the money
and run
,
" his directorial de
but
. howver
, nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this one
- of
- a
- kind display of sheer ogod spirits
. in fact
, infact this movie
, the feeling itself is what
' s most important
. yes
, the movie owudl have been better
-
- among his very best
, i think
-
- if it had a meatier story
.
but what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling
.
and what better way to express feeling than through music
? love is often best expressed in a song
, annd the numbers the cast break into here cutted straight to the heart
. smoe are a tad too goofy
, such as the number where a lot of ghosts prance around in a funeral parlor
,
but i admired allen for even putting them in there
. it alsot helps that as usual
, allen has a top
- flight cast working with him
. their singing voices range from quite good
( goldie hawn
) to nto quite good
( allen
) to literally unlistenable
( barrymore
, whose real voice was dubbed by a professional
)
.
but while their vocal abilities differ
, all tje actors do a great job of putting joy up there on the screen
, adn making it rub off on the audience
. granted
, some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies
,
but for those attuned to it
, this film should work wonders
. jane campion
, too
, has a top
- flight cast wroking for her in
" portrait of a lady
,
" too
,
but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep the film from being a stilted
, virtually lifeless mess
, albeit a visually intresting one
. campion
and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh cmo up wiht a gerat variety of eye
- filling images tht linger in the mind
. unfortunately
, what didn
' t linger in the mind for me ws the story the visuals weere supposed tothe be reflecting
. i remember very well shots of a train with its light beaming
and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman
,
but i can remember very little of what happened between all these people
. even worse
, i don
' t find myself feeling bad that i
' ve forgotten
. the problem
, i think
, lies not with the cast
, which seemed to be trying very hard for the material
. it was tyhe script that couldn
' t convince me to care about anyone
. the characters were putting out all kinds of emotion
,
but i found no reason to connect wiht any of them
. i understood that the story was about cold
, emotionally vacant characters
,
but forthe me to care about them
, i have to identify with them somehow
and want them tothe inject feeling into their lives
. jones
' script never simply gave me that opportunity
. in the end
, it almost seemed as if campion was trying to inject some life of her own into the proceedings wiht her visual flourishes
. unfortunately
, as she kept painting these dazzling picturesk
, they only served to push me further away from the material
and remind me that there was no connection between me
and the film
. in tyhe end
, the movie
' s one strength ended up hurting it
. so here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots
, adn
yet i was able to truly enjoy one of them
. why
? with both films
, my head cared about neither story
,
but only
" everyone says i love you
" was able to make my heart sing
.
