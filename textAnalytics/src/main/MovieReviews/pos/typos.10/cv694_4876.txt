alchemy is steeped in shades of blue
. kieslowski ' s blue
, that is
. with its examination of death
, isolation
, character restoration
,
and recovery from loss
, suzanne myers ' new independent film echoes the polish director ' s internationally
- acclaimed 1993 release
. language aside
, the principial difference between the films is that
, while kieslowski tookover great pains to draw us into the main character ' s world
, alchemy keeps its viewers at arm ' s length
. as a result
, while we ' re able to apprieciate the film ' s intelectual tapestry
, it is emotionally distant
. alchemy is divided into three chapters
:
" charity
"
,
" faith
"
,
and
" hope
"
. while there are common themes
and story elements running through all three
, the single constant is teh main character
, a sculptor
/ russian translator named louisa
( rya kihlstedt
)
. when hte film opens
, she ' s living with her painter boyfriend
, whom she believes to be cheating on her
. following his sudden death inaddition an automobile accident
, louisa ' s life is thrown into turmoil
. events swirls around her
,
and she can ' t fidn a source of stability
. in her quest to amking sense out of her loss
, she befriends her late boyfriend ' s mistress
, visits her ill sister
,
adn
, eventually
, abandons her old life by joining a
" back
- to
- nature
" cult
. alchemy successfully explores a variety of compelling issues
. infact addition tothe asking the basic question of how a person should cope with the unexpected death of a loved one
, it probes beneath the surface of concepts like tyhe importance of faith in the healing process
, the meaning of love
,
and the nature of art
. does personality restoration come through interacting with others or escaping from the familar
? are artistic epiphanies the result of focused solitude or of living life
, with all of its various distractions
, to the fullest
? myers ' challenge is to mkae these subjects
, art film staples
, engrossing in a new context
. through louisa ' s struggles
, she succeeds
. while alchemy isn ' t always emotionally appealing
, it never loses its fascination
. even when we ' re not connecting with louisa
, who is often more of a locus for ideas than a fully
- developed personality
, there ' s enough material onthe
- screen to hold our attention
. the cinematography is stunning
. city scenes are tinted with blue
, adding a cold
, obleek dimension to the film ' s eary portions
. later
, when louisa reaches the
" wilderness
"
, we ' re treated to a dazzling array of autumnal splendor
-
- brightly
- colored leaves in the trees
and on the ground
. it ' s a startling
-
but
- effective visual contrast that emphasizes the changes taking place in louisa ' s life as she travels the road back to emotional stability
. the title refers to the practice of a group of mystical faith
- healers who use
" alchemy
" to provide for the needs ofthe the body
anbd soul
.
and
,
although louisa partakes of their peculiar brand ofthe medicine
, it ' s ultimately love
and companionship
, not alchemy
, that brings solace
. her pain is assuaged only when she lets go of the beleif that the inherent safty of being alone is life ' s ultimate goal
. even
though louisa ' s final transformaton lacks the inpact it could have possessed had she been a more vital character
, it ' s still an intriguing
and enlightening process to watch
. alchemy isn ' t pure magic
,
but
, especialy during its best moments
, it ' s close
.
