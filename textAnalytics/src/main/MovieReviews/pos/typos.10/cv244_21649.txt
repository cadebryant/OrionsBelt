" being john malkovich
" is the type of film we need to see more
. today ' s films are eather blockbusters that entertain us with tiresome formulas
, or those that hve similar themes
. malkovich falls under none of these categories
,
and it ' s quite refreshing to see that occur
. this strangely provoking story
, isnt actually somewhat understandable
. john cusack plays a puppeteer trying to make it to the big time
. his wife
( cameron diaz
) supports the both of them by working at a petstore
, which explains tghe obscure pets they keep in their apartment
. when cusack finally realizes he needs to get a job
, he finds an ad for a filing clerk
. when he reaches the building
, he arrives at a 7 1
/ 2 floor
. it ' s there that he discovers a secret portal that leads to being john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time
. meanwhile
, cusack meets a business partner
( catherine keener
)
, in which he falls madly in love with her
. the onyl problem is
, she has no interest in him waht so ever
. tyhe whole portal thing
, isn ' t just a toy
, in fact
, it becomes cusack ' s dream
. being inside malkovich ' s mind
, gave him the opprotunity tothe basically control mlakovich
, like a puppet
,
and to fulfill his fantasies
. i don ' t want to give away too much
,
but cusack becomes too attached with his discovery
. in my oppinion
, this idea isnt absolutely brilliant
. it ' s really quite scary to think tyhat someone could become you
, control you
, be you
. it makes you wonder why we act like we do
,
and why sometimes we blurt out things or act out something out of the blue
. even if the script is super sharp
, i can ' t help
but find the ending displeasing
. it could have lead up to something more
, or at least an amusing conclusion
. it tried to explane a mythology about the portals
, that made it seem rushed
. other than that
, i had a very enjoyable time
. the acting was quite delightful as well
. john cusack has finally been given a chance to prove his ability
,
annd he does it well
. he ' s by far the most underrated actor due to a lack of popularity
,
but i ' m hoping that wiull change
. cameron diaz was her usual charming self
,
although i felt thyat part was wrong forthe her
,
bu she pulled it off
. john malkovich himself continues to creep out people with his eerie facial expressions
annd tone of voice
. who else ' s mind would be better to explore
? the director
, spike jonze
, who appeared in lastr month ' s three kings really catches my attension with this project
. i knew he was bizzare
,
but not to this extreme
. he too is likely too receive media attention
.
" being john malkovich
" isn ' t an excellent film
,
but it is definitly entertaining
and will eaisly become a cult favorite
. what ' s even better isnt the film ' s puzzling message
.
