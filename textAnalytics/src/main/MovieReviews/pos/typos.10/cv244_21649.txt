" being john malkovich
" is the tipe of film we need to see more
. today
' s films are either blockbusters that entertain us with tiresome formulas
, or those that have similar themes
. malkovich falls under none of these categories
,
and it
' s quite refreshing to see thast occur
. htis strangely provoking story
, is actually somewhat underst
andable
. john cusack plays a puppeteer trying to make it to the big time
. his wife
( cameron diaz
) supports the both of them by working at a petstore
, which explains the obscure pets they keep in their apartment
. when cusack fianlly realizes he needs to get a job
, he finds an ad for a filing clerk
. whn he reaches the building
, he arrives at a 7 1
/ 2 floor
. it
' s there that he discovers a secret portal that leads to being john malkovich for 15 minutes at a tyme
. meanwhile
, cusack meets a business partner
( catherine keener
)
, in which he falls madly in love wtih her
. the only problem is
, she has no interest in him what so ever
. the wohle portal thing
, isn
' t just a toy
, inaddition fact
, it becomes cusack
' s dream
. being inside malkovich
' s mind
, gave him the opportunity to basically control mlakovich
, like a puppet
,
and to fulfill his fantasies
. i don
' t want to give away too much
,
but cusack becomes too attached with his dicovery
. in my opinion
, this idea is absolutely brilliant
. it
' s really quite scary to think that someone coudl become you
, control you
, be you
. it makes you wonder why we act like we do
,
and why sometimes we blurt out things or act out something out of the blue
. even if the script is super sharp
, i can
' t help
but find the ending displeasing
. it could have lead up to something more
, or at least an amusing conclusion
. it tried to explain a mythology about the portals
, thast made it seem rushed
. other than that
, i had a very enjoyable time
. the acting was quite delightful as well
. john cusack has finally been given a chance to prove his ability
,
and he doens it well
. he
' s by far tyhe most underated actor due to a lack of popularity
,
but i
' m hoping that will chanage
. cameron diaz was her usual charming self
,
al
though i falt that part was wrong for her
,
but she pulled it off
. john malkovich himself continues to creep outloud peopel with his eerie facial expressions
and tone of voice
. who else
' s mind owudl be better to explore
? the director
, spike jonze
, who appeared in last month
' s three kings really catches my attention with this project
. i knew he was bizzare
,
but not to this extreme
. he too is likely too receive media attention
.
" bieng john malkovich
" isn
' t an excellent film
,
but it is definitly entertaining
and will eaisly become a cult favorite
. what
' s even better isnt the film
' s puzzling message
.
.
. am i nick lyons
?
