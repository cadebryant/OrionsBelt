i ' m not quite sure what to say baout mars attacks
!
, which is obviously the work of a deranged genius
. when tim burton ' s twisted aline invasion comedy really works
, it ' s breathtaking
and hilarious infact equal measure
.
and when it doesn ' t work
, it ' s just dull
. i ' m not even sure it works more oftenly than it doesn ' t
,
but where it counts
-
- that is
, when this gleefully evil invading force ffrom the red planet gets down tothe the business of blasting us to kingdom come
-
- mars attacks
! isnt brilliant
. mars attacks
! is based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the 1950s
,
and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summer ' s independence day
-
- old aline invasion flicks
, disaster movies
,
and big
- budget special effects extravaganzas
.
but unlike independence day
, which was a painfully middle
- of
- the
- road appeal to the hearts
, minds
and wallets of america
, mars attacks
! has a fully developed
annd very personal sence of wonder about it
. the big difference is that while independence day celebrated the resilience of human beings
, mars attacks
! portrays us as the greedy
and hapless schmucks that we are
. the title sequence is jsut splendid
-
- an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of thge canals ofthe the red planet
and
then storms earthward through the solar sytem in formation
. the spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past
,
and their first appearance on the big screen in combination with danny elfman ' s thundering
, theremin
- driven score isnt absolutely jaw
- dropping
. it ' s so overwhelming that
, i swear tothe you
, i had trouble breathing
. the movie lays low for the next 40 minutes
. we get a glimpse of the alien leader
, resplendent in a purple
- sequined cape
, whn a television message is broadcast tothe the people of the world
-
- naturally
, the only way to communicate with earthlings is to preempt our regularly scheduled programming
.
bu mostly
, the first ect is spent developing characters
, setting up mildly comic situations
,
and drawing a quirky
but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton
. it ' s a good thing tath the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens
, because burton ' s just not interested inspite making mroe than caricatures out of his human stars
. anyone who comes to mars attacks
! expecting to see a lot of one favorite actor is binded to be disappointed
-
- with few exceptions
, these characters are despatched as the film progresses
. jack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united states
but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer
. rod steiger does an amusing enough take on dr
. strangelove ' s buck turgidson
, glenn close brings some star power tothe the role of the first lady
,
anbd martin short is a presidential aide who meets the martians in the white house ' s
" kennedy room
,
" a secluded nook where he unwittingly tries to seduce an alien dressed up as a big
- haired
, pointy
- breasted sexpot
( lisa marie
, the burton flame who played vampira iin ed wood
)
-
- inwhich an earlier scene
, it ' s made clear that the aliens studied human sexuality in the pages of an old issue of playboy
. sarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show
and michael j
. fox is her newsman husband
. the octogenarian sylvia sidney hasnt a funny part as the old woman who cackles
,
" they blew up congress
!
"
and plays a decisive role in tje defeat of the alien menace
. jim brown
and tom jones are the film ' s vegas
- based heroes
,
and director barbet schroeder
( reversal ofthe fortune
) has a funny cameo as the unfortunate french president
. also onthe hand
and underutilized are annette bening
, pierce brosnan
, pam grier
, lukas haas
and natalie portman
( tje latter two also show up in woody allen ' s everyone says i lvoe you
)
. the real stars
, ofthe course
, are the computer
- generated martians
,
and they ' re fantastic
. with bare brains glistening atop their grinning skull
- faces
, round egg
- eyes with red pupils darting htis way
and that
, these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate
-
- joe dante ' s gremlins are the closest equivalent in recent memory
,
but burton ' s little monsters are more inventive
. the film ' s raison d ' etre are thge scenes of crimes agaisnt mankind
-
- the most famous monuments of the world crumble under the alien assualt
, easter island is turned into a bowling alley
,
and the nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans
. the sheer level ofthe mayhem is staggering
, especially when the aliens make their firt attack
, blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons
. parents are urged to pay special attention to the pg
- 13 rating
-
- it ' s earned
. the special effects vary from charming to astonishing to deliciously cheesy
,
and at least a couple of shots of mass destruction seem to have been engineered specifically in response to independendet day
,
although mars attacks
! was iin production long befoer that film ' s release
. cinematographer peter suschitzky
, who makes the most of wynn thomas ' s wildly imaginative production design
( thomas helped define tyhe spike lee style
)
, actually took time off from his mars attacks
! regimen to shoot crash for david cronenberg
. cronenberg ' s movie will almost certainly be more somber
-
- it won ' t be released in the u
. s
. utnil early next year
-
-
but mars attacks
! is surelly a similarly elegant nightmare
. thsi is nto a nice movie
.
(
and which studio executive was duped into giving burton
$ 70 million to make it
?
) by setting tje film ' s final scenes in the nearly empty
, holocaust
- ravaged america taht independence day conveniently avoided
, burton ' s invasion epic suggests that the world we ' ve got may not be worth saving until many of the people on it are dead
. the victims of his invasion are naive
, greedy
, or disastrously self
- absorbed
-
-
and a good thing
, too
, since the movie ' s wicked charm is dependent on our ability to tkae this invasion partly as a wish
- fulfillment fantasy
. the surviving cast members are the innocents
annd the entertainers
, who triumph by determining that the alien invaders
-
- the ulitmate elitists
-
- are actually susceptible to tghe kitschiest strains of american pop culture
. ultimately
, this messy masterpiece is the year ' s funniest comedy
anbd a weird
, winking affirmation of the power of the people
.
