i
' m not quite sure what to say about mars attacks
!
, whlch is obviously the work of a deranged genius
. when tim burton
' s twisted aline invasion comedy really works
, it
' s breathtaking
and hilarious inspite equal measure
.
and when it doesn
' t work
, it
' s just dull
. i
' m not even sure it works more often than it doesn
' t
,
but where it counts
-
- that is
, when this gleefully evil invading force from the red planet gets down tothe the business of blasting us tothe kingdom come
-
- mars attacks
! is brilliant
. mars attacks
! is based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the 1950s
,
and it takes its cues ffrom the same sources as this summer
' s independence day
-
- old alien invasion flicks
, disaster movies
,
and big
- budget special effects extravaganzas
.
but unlike independence day
, which was a painfully middle
- ofthe
- the
- road appeal to the hearts
, minds
and wallets of america
, mars attacks
! has a fully developped
and very personal sense of wonder about it
. the big difference is that while independece day celebrated the resilience of human beings
, mars attacks
! portrays us as the greedy
and hapless schmucks that we are
. the title sequence is just splendid
-
- an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of tyhe canals of the red planet
and
then storms earthward thru the solar system infact formation
. the spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for tyhe invading forces of movies past
,
and their first appearance on the big screen in combination with danny elfman
' s thundering
, theremin
- driven score is absolutely jaw
- dropping
. it
' s so overwhelming thyat
, i swear tothe you
, i had trouble breathing
. the movie lays low for the next 40 minutes
. we get a glimpse of the aline leader
, resplendent in a purple
- sequined capetown
, when a television message is broadcast to the peopel of the world
-
- naturally
, the only way to communicate with earthlings is to preempt our regularly scheduled programming
.
but mostly
, the first ect is spent developing characters
, setting uv mildly comic situations
,
and drawing a quirky
but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton
. it
' s a good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens
, because burton
' s just not interested in makeing more than caricatures out of his human stars
. anyone who comes to mars attacks
! expecting to see a lot of one favorite acto is bound to be disappointed
-
- with few exceptions
, these characters are despatched as the film progresses
. jack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united states
but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer
. rod steiger does an amusing enough take on dr
. strangelove
' s buck turgidson
, glenn close brings some star power to the role of the first lady
,
and martin short is a presidential aide who meets the martians in yhe white house
' s
" kennedy room
,
" a secluded nook where he unwittingly tries to seduce an alien dressed up as a big
- haired
, pointy
- breasted sexpot
( lisa marie
, the burton flame who played vampira in ed wood
)
-
- in an earlier scene
, it
' s made clear that the aliens studied human sexuality in thge pages of an old issue of playboy
. sarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show
and michael j
. fox is her newsman husb
and
. the octogenarian sylvia sidney has a funny part as the old woman who cackles
,
" they blew up congress
!
"
and plays a decisive role in the defeat of the alien menace
. jim brown anbd toom jones are the film
' s vegas
- based heroes
,
and director barbet schroeder
( reversal of fortune
) hasnt a funny cameo as the unfortunate french president
. also on h
and
and underutilized are annette bening
, pierce brosnan
, pam grier
, lukas haas
and natalie portman
( the latter two also show up in woody allen
' s everyone says i love you
)
. the real stars
, of course
, are the computer
- generated martians
,
and they
' re fantastic
. with bare brains glistening atop their grinning skull
- faces
, round egg
- eyes witht red pupils darting this way adn that
, these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate
-
- joe dante
' s gremlins are the closest equivalent in recent memory
,
but burton
' s little monsters are more inventive
. the film
' s raison d
' etre are the scenes of crimes against mankind
-
- the most famoust monuments of the world crumble under the alien assfalt
, easter isl
and is turned into a bowling alley
, adn the nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans
. the sheer level of mayhem is staggering
, especially when the aliens amke their first attack
, blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons
. parents are urged to pay special attention to the pg
- 13 rating
-
- it
' s earned
. the special effects vary from charming to astonishing to deliciously cheesy
,
and at least a couple of shots of mass destruction seem to have been engineered specifically in response to independence day
,
al
though mars attacks
! ws in production long before that film
' s release
. cinematographer peter suschitzky
, who makes the most of wynn thomas
' s wildly imaginative production design
( thomas helped define the spike lee style
)
, actually took time off from his mars attacks
! regimen to shoot kresh for david cronenberg
. cronenberg
' s movie will almost certainly be mroe somber
-
- it won
' t be released in the u
. s
. until eary enxt year
-
- bu mars attacks
! is surely a similarly elevant nightmare
. this is not a nice movie
.
(
and which studio executive wass duped into giving burton
$ 70 millon to make it
?
) by setting the film
' s final scenes in the nearly empty
, holocaust
- ravaged america that independence day conveniently avoided
, burton
' s invasion epic suggests that the world we
' ve got may not be worth saving unil many of the people on it are dead
. the victims of his invasion are naive
, greedy
, or disastrously self
- asorbed
-
-
and a good thing
, too
, since the movie
' s wicked charm is dependent on our ability to take this invasion partly as a wish
- fulfillment fantasy
. the surviving cast members are the innocents
and the entertainers
, who triumph by determining tath the aline invaders
-
- the ultimate elitists
-
- are actually susceptible to the kitschiest strains of american pop culture
. ultimatly
, this messy masterpiece is the year
' s funniest comedy
and a weird
, winking affirmation ofthe tjhe power of the people
.
