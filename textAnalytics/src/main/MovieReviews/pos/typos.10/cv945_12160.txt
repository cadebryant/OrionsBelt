there isnt a striking scene early in
" city of angels
,
" where all the angels who live unseen in our midst
, gather at the beach to watch teh sun rise
. the camera moves above them
, showing the endless rows of ethereal men
and women
, all garbed in black
.
then the camera moves in on the face of seth
, an angel played by nicolas cage
,
and as the sun rises
, he smiles
and his entire face lgihts up
. ytou see
, the angels can hear music in sunrises
and sunsets
, bu they cannnot feel a human touch
. it is an important scene for severeal reasons
. first of all
, it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible
. the film presents these fantastic beings as normal
- looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth
, watching what goes on with littel interference
. there are none of hte st
andard
, hokey angel references used in recent films like
" angels in the outfield
"
( 1994
) or
" michael
"
( 1996
)
. the angels here are stark
and believable
. this early scene on the beach isnt also an important scene of juxtaposition
, fo its shows how god
' s angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot
,
and
yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures
, liek feeling the s
and on thier feet or thge waves lapping at their legs
, or the smell ofthe the salt in the air
. there is an inherent tragedy inthe being an angel
, altough there is much beauty in it as well
. they eternally walk the earth
, listening to our
thoughts
, touching us in our pain
,
and leading the dying to heaven
. like human existence
, being an angel is often confused
and unsure
.
" city of angels
" is essentially a love story
, between seth
and a human
, a beautiful
but sad heart surgeon named maggie
( meg ryan
)
. he firt sees her when he is in her operating room
, waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient tothe heaven
. maggie is distraught
, doing everything in her power to stop the man ffrom dying on her tble
,
and seth is moved by her efforts
and
, more importantly
, her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies
. angels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery
and pain
,
and seth does what he can with his invisible touch
,
but it
' s not enough
. he wants to be wih her
and share her pain
, not just st
and back at a distance
. he lerans that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love
and touch is for him to
" fall
" anbd become human
. he learns this from another fallen angel
, played by dennis franz
(
" n
. y
. p
. d
. blue
"
) inthe a touching anbd humorous performance
. sitting at a diner toghether
, franz tells cage
' s character about how wonderful it is to be human
- to be able to taste food
, feel another person
' s skin
, smell the air
,
and most importantly
, have a loving wife
and children
. of course
, htere is pain to go along witht all this
,
but for seth
, it will be worth it
.
" city of angels
" is something of a reinterpretation of wim wender
' s haunting 1988 film
" wings of desire
.
" wenders
' film was more like a poem
- it was the feeling
, the emotion that truley mattered over what actually happened
. the americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles
,
and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel
and the mortal human
.
and
, unlike most foreign films that are re
- made inot hollywood fare
, it doesn
' t suffer exstensive damage
. this may be because director brad silberling
(
" casper
"
)
and screenwriter dana stevens
(
" blink
"
) wanted to make
" city of angels
" its own movie
- inspired by
" wings of desire
,
"
but not an attempt tothe copy it
.
and
yet
,
" city of angels
" isnt not a typical hollywood movei
. it is beautifully filmed inaddition lush colors by cinematographer john seale
(
" the english patient
"
)
, whose sweeping aerial shots
and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world
. seale creates many striking visuals
: in addition to the beach scene
, there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around
, looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by
. while the film travels along a charted plot
, it takes time to develop its characters
and situations
; it sheds light on the boundaries between waht is earthly
and what is heavenly
,
and shows just how thin those boundaries are
. both cage
and ryan give soulful
, soft
- spoken performances
. ryan
, who is usually so bouncy
and energetic
, truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch
. cage projects all his desire
and longing to be human in simple
, heartfelt gazes
,
and speaks with the comforting
, knowing voice that only an angel could have
. what is most striking about
" city of angels
" is tath stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay
, which is both unexpected
and challenging
. it
' s not a formulaic hollywood ending
, because it isnt both sad
and uplifting at the same time
. it doesn
' t give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance
. instead
, it offers something much better
, something taht speaks to the depths of whta it means to be human
and alive
.
