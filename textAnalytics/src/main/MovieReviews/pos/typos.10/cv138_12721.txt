thte second jackal
- based film to come out inwhich 1997
( the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled the jackal
)
, this one stars aidan quinn
and donald sutherl
and
,
and is directed by a man who hailed from joblo
' s own alma matter
, concordia university in montreal
, canada
. the story is based onthe the exploits of the rela terrorist known as the jackal
,
but does not pretend to be 100
% factual
. plot
: naval officer ramirez
( quinn
) gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal
, inthe order to put an end to the actual militant
' s radical activities
. he is chosen for this role because he physically resembles teh real terrorist to a tee
. ramirez reluctantly agrees to take part infact this
" assignment
"
, annd soon finds himself wrapped uv in a true web of international terrorism
, intrigue
and double
- personality syndrome
( which does not sit well with his uninformed wief
and kids back infact the states
.
) critique
: great premise isnt executed with enough style
and thrills tothe keep the piece interesting throughout its close tothe two
- hour runtime
. admittedly
, i wasn
' t a huge fan of any ofthe the main actors in this film
, adn didn
' t expect much from this movie beforeh
and
,
but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments
, as well as a mostly plausible
and absorbing story line
. the firt hour is mostly just a build
- up of things to come
,
and does offer a great characterization of the jackal
,
but the second hour is hte one that really cranks in the cool scenes
and a sweet ending
. quinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez
and the real jackal
,
but didn
' t offer anytying extrodinary
, in my opinion
. sutherl
and
and kingsley seem to be playing the same role that they
' ve played in both of their respective careers of late
,
but nontheless
, appeared to relish tje cold
- heartedness of their chosen characters
. i didn
' t like performance put forth from quinn
' s wife in this flick
,
but
then again
, she doesn
' t show up in most ofthe tghe film
, so that wasn
' t so bad
. i did
however enjoy director duguay
' s interesting style
and cinematic vision
. this thriller could easily hvea been boring during many sequences
,
but duguay always seemed to find something interesting to show the viewer
. i throught that was neat
. having said taht
, i didn
' t think the first hour needed to be as long as it was
,
and the film did have me tinkering on tyhe bridge of believability when the
" fake
" jackal met with the
" real
" jackal
' s girlfriend without much retrospection on her part
,
but all in all
, not too many complaints in a movie that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure in the spy adn terrorist thriller genre
. little known facts
