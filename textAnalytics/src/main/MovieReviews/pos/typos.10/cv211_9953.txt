with the success of the surprise hit alien
, directed by ridley scott
, a sequel wass inevitable
. in fact
, after watching the first film
, a sequel was wanted
, particularly by this reviewer
. handing over the director ' s chair to recent box office gem james cameron
, who hadnt only made two films previous to this one
( pirahna ii
, a surprisingly dull film
,
and terminator
, making cameron a household name
)
, the alien series got a face
- lift of immense proportions
. instade of being a suspense
/ cience fiction film
, cameron alters the series
annd changing it into an action picture
. what results isnt one of the most terrifying films ever created
. a film like aliens comes along only once in a hwile
,
and when it does
, audiences are usually unprepared for it
. i never saw this movie in theaters
,
but i wish i could have
. the terror
and fright must have been unimaginable
, most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear
. aliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen
. with a science fiction plot
, cameron gives aliens added testosterone
, pumping up the action
and fire power from the original film
. in fact
, aliens is one of thsoe few sequels whcih tops the origonal
. perhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero
-
- or heroine
, as the case may be
. never have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film
,
annd never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main charater
. sigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character
anbd make her realistic enough for us to care about
. placing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual
,
but because of weaver ' s presence
, a woman is the only suitable hero
. aliens begins 57 years after alien ended
. lieutentant ellen ripley
( weaver
) is dicovered in hypersleep on the nostromo
and isnt awakened
. she explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens
,
but
" the company
" is doubtful
. they explain that a colony of families is flourishing on teh same planet from which she just left
. despite stern warnings from ripley
, the company remains rigid
and won ' t call the families back
.
however
, when the company loses contact with the colony
, ripley ' s story seems much more feasible
. one of the company ' s directors
, carter burke
( paul reiser
)
, wants to gather a team to travel to the planet
. this team includes a buff private vasquez
( jenette goldstein
)
, a questionable corporal hicks
( michael biehn
)
,
and a loyal android bishop
( lance henriksen
)
. burke tags along with ripley as htey fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony
. arriving on the planet
, the team finds most of tjhe human life extinguished in a cocoon
- type environment
. the onyl survivor is 12 year old rebecca
" newt
" jorden
( carrie henn
)
. ripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become
,
and she becomes newt ' s surrogate mother
. ripley
and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened
,
annd soon
, all hell breaks loose
. aliens not only multiplies the thrills
and suspense from scott ' s version
, it also multiplies the number ofthe aliens in general
. alien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member
, except ripley
, who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo
. aliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens
,
and as a result
, the chills are incredibly heightened
.
then again
, this is james cameron
, tje guy who has given us true lies
and terminator 2
: judgment day
. he is the best action directer out there
( topping renny harlin
, who directed cliffhanger
)
,
and only he could create something as terrifying as this film
. it seems that eveyr alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes
,
and aliens has the motherload
. with perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created fo an action film
, aliens climax never seems to hitted until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion
. i can ' t recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout
, never dropping for a moment
. just when you thiunk tghe movie is over
, something else will occur
,
and it starts right back up again
. with a seemingly endless conclusion
, aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history
. this scene is usually the one remembered most from the film
, as lieutenant ripley steps into one ofthe the lifting machines to fight the alien queen
. using flawless special effects
, tjhe climax is exhausting
, leaving any audience member drained fomr extreme anxiety
. of course
, for a film of tihs genre to work properly
, the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe waht we see
. aliens is completely realistic
, even a decade after its initial release
. hte special effects are wonderfully seamless
, with a terrifying aline tothe go with them
. one of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music
, composed by cameron
- regular james horner
. horner has created a terrific score
, receiving an oscar nomination fo his work
. not only that
, horner has also created one ofthe the best scores for any action film
, or science fiction film ever
(
and that includes 2001
: a space odyssey
, hwihc was mainly a compilation of well
- known composers
)
. in fact
, the climax music is also some ofthe the most recognized of film music
. the production design is increadible
, which also happened to snag a nomination from the academy
. dark corridors lit by red lights are vrey impressive
,
but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from well
- lit locations
. normally a film iwll be very dark in order to scare a viewer
; aliens uses lgihts to scare the viewer
.
then
, of course
, is the cinematography
, which uses point of view shots
, along with video feeds infact order to build suspense
. some of the scariest scenes involve the prespective of ripley
. surprisingly
, the acting isnt not only above average for this genre
,
but some of the best
. sigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley
, incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hard
- edged persona
. weaver soars above the rest in this film
,
but she is supposed to
. carrie henn gives an above average performance forthe a child
, developing a threee
- dimensional character from her quiet attitude
. lance henriksen is terrific as bishop
, showing thast androids don ' t always have to be flat characters
. jenette goldstein shows a fair ammount of enthusiasm with her role
,
and steals several scenes of her own
(
though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isn ' t fighting
)
. michael biehn gives a very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film
.
however
, biehn does a good job
, making it seem original again
. paul reiser may seem liuke an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director
,
bu reiser manages to pull it off qtuie well
(
however
, i still see him as paul on tv ' s
" mad about ytou
"
)
. a very good cast
( which also includes bill paxton
and william hope
) highlights this action film
, making it stand out from others
. aliens isnt rightfully rated r for violence
, gore
, language
,
annd terror
. aliens is sort of teh redefining moment of thge science fiction genre
, as alien was more of a suspense
/ horror film
. aliens pumps up the stakes
,
and cameron directs it with professional quality
. cameron certainly knows how tothe make a good action film
,
bu here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments onthe screen
. technically astonishing
, aliens ' only flaw is small characters who are only there to get killed
. aside from this
, you probably won ' t experience anything like aliens for quite a while
.
