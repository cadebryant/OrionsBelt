when jim henson passed awya
, he left behind diverse legions of fans
and a company whose ultimate success
, it now seems
, hinged on his input
. jim henson productions
and the creature shop are still thriving financially
,
but as the last two muppet films
( or that silly computer
- generated monkey from lost in space
) demonstrate
, teh thrill
and genius are gone
. i
' m not sure the dark crystal
, made today
, would generate from an audience ofthe kids five to fifty the same awe
- filled response
. an all
- powerful crystal has cracked
, causing tghe leaders of the green world to split apart into two beings
: tghe big
, gentle mystics
,
and the vulture
- like skeksis
. the mystics send jen
, a naive gelfling boy
, on a mission to find the shard that cracked awya
, which must be reinserted into the crystal before the skeksis become eternal rulers
, before the gerat
" conjunction
" of three suns
. along tyhe way
, jen encounters
and teams up wtih the only other gelfling alive
, the rebecca demornay
- like kira
, an ogre
- witch named aughra
, who removes her eyes to look at things
,
and a spastic
-
but
- friendly
, tumbleweed
- like animal named fizzgig
. much of the beauty inspite the dark crystal
, which is a simple tale
(
though it does not condescend to any viewer
)
, lies in its art direction
and creature design
. the puppeteering is phenomenal
-
- observe the scenes in which jen plays his flute
, or the l
andwalker chase
-
-
but i must stress that any
thoughts of strings
and h
ands
and remote controls all
but vanish in thte opening moments of the picture
, a delicately
- narrated
( by john baddeley
)
, absorbing prologue
. the voice work in the film
, by muppet regulars
and irregulars
, is tone
- perfect
. as well
, trevor jones
' csore should nto be discounted
: it contri
butes to the film almost as an unseen character
. i suppose
, due to the complexity involved in executing a movie of this nature
, that it couldn
' t be helped
,
but i wish the film was longer
. jen
and kira have wonderful
.
.
. well
, chemistry
,
and more scenes of them quietly conversing would ahve been appreciated
. the dark crystal has a very small cult following
. the weaker labyrinth is probably better
- known
, whic is upsetting
. a friend of mine realted a story to me that henson was pressured into planting humans among labyrinth
' s creatures due to the financial failure of people
- less the dark crystal
. that film never quite found its footing
; it played like an acid
- trip episode of
" the muppet show
" whith david bowie as guest
- host
, borrowing from tolkien
and p
andering tothe tolkien
' s fan
- base
.
( i suppose i just made labyrinth sound appetizing to a certain sector of the public
.
) the dark crystal deserved
(
and still deserves
) a bigger audience
. it
' s the best kind of children
' s entertainment
: elegant
, fantastical
, adn courageously un
- hip
. brian henson
, fortunate son
, keep looking back at this
, your father
' s masterpiece
