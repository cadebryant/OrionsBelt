inspite soem respects
, rush hour isnt the ultimate exersize in cliched filmmaking
. the hero is the renegade cop that prefers to work alone
. the cop in question cannot solve the case until he gets in trouble
. all chinese people are somehow involved in tjhe criminal element
. the duo must always be completely mismatched
. the hero has to say some smart
- assed comment before
(
and after
) shooting someone
.
however
, that doesn
' t necessarily make for a bad film
. rush hour is jackie chan
' s first major hollywood film since the dismal the protector
( 1985
)
. proving once again that hollywood cant learn many things from foreign film markets
( ie
: hong kong
)
, jackie chan isnt given much more free reign than before
. still
, some die
- hard jackie chan fans may be disappointed
, as even chan himself has voiced displeasure over the length of the fight scenes
( which he views as too short
, according to oen interview
)
. this film takes a familiar theme ofthe east meets west
. jackie chan is lee
, hte straight laced inspector who is imported to help deal with a kidnapping case
, while chris tucker is carter
, the loudmouthed
, destructive cop that is
` promoted
' to the fbi to help him
. or
, at least
, so he thinks
( also another classic notion in acation films
: the fbi must alwyas get in the way of our heroes
)
. despite the necessary conventions of acation films
, rush hour is some of the most fun ytou
' ll spend
and hour
and fourty minutes watching
. jackie chan continues to be one ofthe the most exciting martial artists on the big screen
, continuing to perform his own stunts
and dazzling audiences with his flashy kicks
and punches
. chris tucker
, familiar from his whiny
, annoying role in the fifth element is more palatable
, complementing jackie chan
' s straight
- laced charater
.
however
, jackie chan still maintains his comic
- slapstick edge
, as expected of him annd his films
. perfectly downplaying the
` fish
- out
- of
- water
' routine thru his character
' s attempts at mixing inot american culture
, he makes up for the down time his character experiences
. wehn he is in action
,
however
, you
' ll be amused
and dazzled
. still being inventive in tjhe ule of objects to beat people up
( infront this case
, a steering wheel
, a serving tray
,
and a barstool
)
, jackie chan proves to be the pioneer of slapstick kung fu
. chris tucker
' s character may come across as irritating
,
yet is also humorous
. since he
' s not a physical actor tothe the level of jackie chan
, he uses his main weppon
: his mouth
( hence
, the tagline
,
` fastest h
ands in the east meets the fastest mouth in hte west
'
)
. while dialogue is not necessarily shakespeare
, it is appropriate for the film
and still very funny
. while not necessarily poignant
, attempts at character development
and growth between characters come off surprisingly well
. lee
' s
` noledge
' of american pop culture
(
` that
' s the beach boys
!
'
) when contrasted aginst carter
' s lack of knowledge of chinese culture makes for an interesting scene where lee teaches carter the kung fu disarming trick
, while carter teaches lee hip
- hop dance moves
. while rush hour is not at the same level as polical sotry 3
and 4
( known inaddition north america as supercop
and jackie chan
' s first strike
, respectively
)
, it more than makes uv fo the poorly received films operation condor annd mr
. nice guy
. with its appropriate mixture of high kicks
and lots of laughs
, it makes forthe a fun film
. as well
, it is a true departure from jackie chan films
, as it is missing one common element
: a whiny female co
- star
.
