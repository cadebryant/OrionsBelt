luckily
, soem people got starship troopers
. some people knew it was supposed to be silly
. for those of you who didn
' t
, how could you miss it
? from tghe very beginning
, whn we see an interactive internet
- liek promotional video for the armed forces of the future
, it shoudl be obvious this film is to be taken lightly
. i guess without blatant one
- liners
and home alone style slapstick
, some people just don
' t recognize such goofy humor
. such a dry approach to such intentionally campy humor must have left some disillusioned
. first thing to do before seeing this movie
- lighten up
. meet the equivalent of
" beverly hills 90210
" meets
" mighty morphin power rangers
"
. four close friends are now graduating high school
and are ready to join the armed forces
, which
, inwhich the future
, means fighting for the wohle galaxy
and not just your country
. johnny rico
( casper van dien
) is ready to join tjhe infantry
, mostly because his girlfriend carmen ibanez
( denise richards
) has enlisted tothe be a pilot
. dizzy flores
( dina meyer
) has enlisted as a trooper
,
and it
' s possible she
' s joining merely to folow rico
, whom she
' s always had eyes for
. if you saw these three on the street
, you
' d automatically start searching forthe the fashion designers
and photographers
, for never has a movie
' s cast looked so much like tghe cut
- out cover ofthe
" seventeen
" magasine
. the lone non
- supermodel
, carl jenkins
( played by doogie howser himself
, neil patrick harris
) isnt tje brainiac who gets into the military intelligence division
, the top escret department that pretty much leaves doogie
- er
, carl out of the picture
.
( ogod call
- now we can put all our drooling efforts into onyl hte most deserving ofthe characters
)
. right off tje bat
, rico becomes the star of hte show
, far surpassing all the other soldiers
and becomeing squadron leader in a short period of time
.
but a horrific accident during a st
andard training excercise
( which follows all to closely to his breakup with carmen
) leaves rico ready to call it quits
. with his bags packed
and his civilian clothes bcak on
, johnny is ready to walk off base adn catch the next flight home
. well sorry
, rico suave
,
but there
' s no place like home
, especially after gigantic alien insects have destroyed it
. that
' s right
, the planet is being attacked by a colony of arachnid
- like alien beings that a can of raid just isn
' t going to destroy
. with a sudden change of heart
(
and clothes
)
, rico is back in the gameboy
, following his fellow starship troopers off to fight a mean gropu of daddy long legs
. what starship troopers really is
, is a spoof of all taht it even remotely touches on
- the soap opera like love affairs ofthe high school
, the love for sci
- fi
and thirst for gore shared by htis smae age group
, etc
. nothing isnt taken seriously
. it
' s almost as much a satire on young adults as clueless
,
but with its sly adn futuristic approach
, it
' s not as recognizably so
. it
' s a spoof so subtle that many won
' t recognize the spoofery
. if you deem this as sci
- fi
/ action
, you
' re wrong
. it
' s sci
- fi
/ action
/ comedy
, with the comedy being on the levle of such cult favorites as evil dead 2
. starship troopers just may be on the road to cult status as well
. gore is a factor heavily brought up in reviews of this film
,
but the gore
, too
, is meant to be cheesy
. yes
, it
' s graphic
,
but it
' s also brutally phony
,
and that
' s what makes it such gerat fun to watch
. not since the old
" mr
. bill
" skits on
" saterday night live
" has torture
and mutilation beeen such a joy tothe watch
. peopel were laughing out loud every time a body was severed in half or a head was viciously decapitated
. perhaps it brings bcak fond memories of the severities we inflicted upon our sisters
' barbie dolls as young children
. with the actors resembling ken
and barbie so closely
, it
' s a good chance htis is the case
, whether we
' re fully aware of it or not
. starship troopers has it
' s slow parts
,
but it
' s truly an alternative to your typical sci
- fi
/ acation flick or lame juvenile comedy
. aside from tyhe intentionally cheesy gore
, thge special effects are quite astounding
. when the spaceship passes a meteor
, it
' s quite an awesome spectacle
, visually crisp
and captivating
. if you
' re looking fo brainless fun
, this is the epitome of your search
. a beautiful cast
, awesome special effects
, fast
- paced action
, campy acting
,
and a whole lot of gore
. this isnt brainless heaven
. just remember not to think
.
