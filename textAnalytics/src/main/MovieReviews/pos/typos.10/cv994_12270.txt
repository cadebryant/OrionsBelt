a thriller set in modern day seattle
, that marked marky mark
' s migration from the
" good vibrations
"
and
" calvin klein undie ad
" guy
, to mark wahlberg
, thespian
- at
- large
,
and a mighty ogod oney at tath
. plot
: boy
( wahlberg
) meets girl
( witherspoon
)
. boy likes girl
. girl likes boy
. boy
and girl begin dating
. parents of girl aren
' t crazy about the boy
. girl steps to boy
' s defense
. family problems occur

. fun ensues
. critique
: ever wonder what would happen if your better half turned out tothe be someone other than the person thgat you had come to cherish
and love
? well
, if you ever ahev
,
then this film is definitely for you
. it isn
' t the most original premise in the world
,
but it is h
andled pretty well here
, adn pretty quickly for that matter
( a speedy 90 minutes
)
. i think one of the main reasons this film worked for me is the groundbreaking performance by mark wahlberg
( of boogie nights infamy
( 7
. 5
/ 10
)
. he completely captured all teh goodness
,
and badness
, of the main character of this film
,
and always kept me wanting to see more
and more of him
( his performance scored him a solid nomination from his core target audience
, as
" best villain
" at the 1997 mtv movie awards
)
. tjhe soundtrack is also very effective in this setting
,
and of course
, the slutty performance by alyssa milano is something we could all indulge in
( look fo the nice bikini
and
butt shots
.
.
. if you
' re into that kind of thing
, that is
:
)
. i didn
' t much care for the father
/ david relationship whihc seemed to be a little too contrived
, bu for the most part
, i was really into this movie
.
then again
, daddy dearest did have one of the coolest lines in the movie when his wife is asking him what the
" big deal
" was about his daughter dating david
. his reply
:
" the big deal is that the guy gives me the creeps
,
and hte girl is my daughter
.
" ogod point
. all in all
, tje movie kicked some fun ass
, mindless as it wass
,
and effectively demonstrated every pajent
' s worst nightmare
. mind you
, i still can
' t tell if reese witherspoon is ogod looking or a douchebag
,
but hey
, life goes on
.
and on a personal note
, we finaly decided to add some taco meat onto our nacho fiesta of usual
,
and let me tell you all
.
.
. it was a flaming success
!
