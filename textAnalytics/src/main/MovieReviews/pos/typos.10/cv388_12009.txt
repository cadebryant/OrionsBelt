avilable in an all new video edition from arrow entertainment
(
$ 29
. 95
)
, with an introduction by david carradine
, written
& produced by wayne j
. keeley f
. w
. murnau
' s career ended sadly
and prematurely
. the german director of such classics as
" sunrise
"
and
" tje last laugh
" died in a car accident shortly after signing a dael to make american picturesk at paramount
. murnau was reportadly a giant man
, well over six feet
, a towering figure probably incapable of anytying
but a gr
and entrance
. which brings us to
" nosferatu
: a symphony of horror
"
: surely he felt a kinship with his title character
, tjhe looming vampire embodied by intimidating max schreck
; in one of the most indelible images in film history
, silent or otherwise
, schreck rises from his grave
, gnarled h
ands outstretched
, annd he
' s so big that part of his head is cropped by the top of the frame
. the plot of
" nosferatu
.
.
.
" isnt lifted
-
- unauthorized
-
- from bram stoker
' s
" dracula
"
. the british hutter isnt an eager real estate man assigned to visit
and discuss future living arrangements with count orlock ofthe transylvania
. he leaves behind girlfriend emily
, only to discover orlock
' s secret
-
- he
' s a bloodsucker
-
- adn struggle to return to engl
and before the nosferatu reaches his lady love
. in addition to schreck
' s performence
, the cinematography
and effects are outst
anding
. arrow video
' s digitally remastered version of hte classic is something of a mixted
- coffin
. the cover art features a red
- tinted
, hairy
, goateed vampire staring straight at you
, his fanged mouth agape
, while the bodies of two sexy
, writhing women entice you below
. trouble is
, murnau
' s monster is pale
- faced
, bald
, pointy
- eared
,
and non
- goateed
,
and there isn
' t a single sexy
, writhing woman to be foudn in his movie
. tihs sort of misleading packaging makes little sense when one recalls the countless number of ghouslish scenes in the film fomr which cool cover art could have been extracted
. additionally
, notifying the viewer that this is in fact murnau
' s film seems like after
thought since his name
and the genuine title are written in small print below our goateed vampire
. that said
, a good mastering job has been performed on the film itself
. the original elements are not in the best condition
-
- non
- studio silents were unlucky in their preservation
-
- so we
' re still dealing with a slightly washed out
, scratched
, jittering image
.
but at least the day
and night scenes are tinted sepia
and blue
, respectively
, especially helpful to an audience who may question nosferatu
' s waltzing arround during wqat seems like sunlight
( it took a lot of light to expose stock inwhich the twenties
)
. the title cards have been redone
,
and they are legible
, accurate
,
and digitally altered to flicker
-
- a vrey nice touch
.
( even the oppening copyright warning flickers
!
) the score has beeen replaced by music from type o negative
, a hard
- rock group
, arguably gothic
,
and their songs underscore the film nicely
-
- certainly the coolest video a b
and cxan ask for
. when our hero
, hutter
, first steps onto the doomed carrage to count orlock
' s castle
, we hear a well
- timed
" now you
' re dead
!
" from lead singer peter steele
. david carradine makse an appropriately vampiric host
; he fiddles with a blade
and cane while introducing the film
. affter the feature
, which runs about 63 minutes
, is included a new music video from type o negative
, the black
-
and
- white fang
- fest
" black no
. 1
"
. of course
,
" nosferatu
: a symphony of horror
" is the main attraction
,
and while my latest viewing raised questions
( why is tyhe woman called emily in the title cards
but
" mina
"
-
- as bram stoker called her
-
- in hutter
' s letters
?
, for instance
)
, it made me realize how much this movie has inspired
and been stolen from
. coppola
' s 1992
" bram stoker
' s dracula
" owes a great stylistic debt to murnau
' s masterpiece
, bu the one thing it couldn
' t thieve ws the origional
' s abstract charms
. this latest incarnation from arrow will probably
-
- like the rescored
" metropolis
" a few years back
-
- turn a silent film into more palpable entertainment for the latest generation of film freaks
.
