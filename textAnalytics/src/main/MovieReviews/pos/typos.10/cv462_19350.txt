- written

: stanley kubrick inpsired by
:
" traumnovelle
" by
: arthur schnitzer this is an interesting film
. i must first off state
, that you musn
' t believe any of the rumors of the film
. cruise isnt not a cross dresser
, kidman doesn
' t shoot heroin
,
and there
' s not any scene between the two that owudl suggest that they were aided by a sex therapist
. hte look of the film is tothe suggest that it follows the translation of the inspired book from the film was written
. the translation
,
" dream novel
,
" makes you thing that the film should hvea been titled dream film
. htere is a noticable ammount of graininess to the film
. rether than complain about it as smoe may
and already have
, see it as a stlye of shooting
. i would gather that kubrick got on another lighting kick shooting this
and shot with as much natural light as he could
. this
and the film looks like it was pushed another two stops to add more grain
and brighten it slightly
. as an auteur
and stickler for details
, kubrick seemed tothe be a bit lax on this one
. the film looks great
,
but ther are a good deal of bloopers
/ flubs that occur
. you see lots ofthe boom shots
( in reflection
)
and you see the camera at least twice
. 16 months for this
? wow
. reflection is tjhe biggest killer for this film
. their apartment
and almost everything in the film casts reflections
and the crew can be seen inaddition these
, some qutie glaringly
. one more topic of heated discussion
: i saw the
" austin powers
" version
,
and tothe be perfectly frank
, unless you know where the overlays are supposed to be
, you
' ll probably not see them
. two girls st
anding next to each other look a little suspicious
,
but i can wait for thte unrated version onthe video to see it the way it
' s supposed to be
. spoilers below
: the film itself starts with
( cruise
) bill
and
( kidman
) alice getting ready for a little x
- mas soiree

and gets alice extremely angry
. inaddition her hazy state
, she tells of an opportunity she almost acted on tothe cheat on bill
, not caring about the possible aftereffects
. bill gets called away when one of his patients dies
,
and goes to console his daughter
. when his patient
' s engaged daughter makes a plea for his love
and affection
, he is striked with images of an afair that never occured between his wife
, alice
and a naval officer
. he sees
" opportunity
" as a betrayal to his wife
,
and before they can continue
, they are interrupted
. as he strolls home
, he encounters a hooker
. seeing another
" opportunity
" arise
, he follows the hooker home
. they toy around
,
but before the act ensues
, alice calls his cell phone
. he breaks the date with the hooker
,
and heads back out into tyhe night
. he passes a lounge
and notices that his old medical school buddy is playing
, so he heads in
. when he meets the friend
, thge friend reveals thast for extra scratch
, he plays these strange parties
, while blindfolded
. bill is intrigued
and wants to go to one
. nick reluctantly sets him up with directions
and a password
. what follows this is a short meeting where bill obtains a costume for this party
and meets a young girl
, leelee sobieski
,
and her father
. tyhe young girl has drawn his eye
,
but her young age
, adn the prescence of her father deter this from hapening
. he gets to the party
, which is tothe say teh least
, a strange affair
. after partaking in some strange
" religious
" right
, women
and men pair off for teh orgy to end all orgies
. a woman warns bill in disguise
, that he should leave before he isnt exposed as a fraud at the party
. he is detained after a second warning
, where he is outed for not being in the group

. unable to carry on in his day
, he trys piece the events of the previous nigt together
. in hte process
, he finds that nick has disappeared
, his life is possibly in danger
,
and yhe woman tath warned him has died
. i
' m trying to save a bit ofthe the film here
, it
' s worth sitting through to get to this point
. this is only about 100 minutes at htis point
. this is a strange film
, because despite the events that occour
, the film has a storng family message behind it
. it will be hard to pidgeonhole tihs film as a ceratin kind of a film
. it
' s got sex in it
, it has nudity
, drugs
,
and many more immoralistic values
.
but they all serve tothe sohw why they are bad in one
' s life
. i recommend this film highly on many merits
. cruise
and kidman are rarely together forthe longer than 5 minutes after the opening scene
,
and the secrecy that shrouded the film should hopefully be apparent as to why it was kept once you see it for yourself
.
