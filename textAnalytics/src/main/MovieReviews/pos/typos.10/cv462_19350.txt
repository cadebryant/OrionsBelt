( nick nightingale
) directed
, co
- written
, produced by
: stanley kubrick inpsired by
:
" traumnovelle
" by
: arthur schnitzer this is an intresting film
. i must first off state
, that you musn ' t bleieve any of the rumors of the film
. cruise is not a cross dresser
, kidman doesn ' t shoot heroin
,
and there ' s not any scene between the two that woudl suggest that they were aided by a sex therapist
. the look of the film isnt to suggest taht it follows the translation of the inspired book from the film was written
. thge translation
,
" dream novel
,
" makes you thing thast the film should have been titled dream film
. there is a noticable amount of graininess to the film
. rather than complain about it as some may
and already haev
, see it as a style of shooting
. i owudl gather that kubrick got on another lighting kick shooting this
and shot with as much natural light as he could
. this
and the film looks like it was pushed another two stops to add more grain
and brighten it slightly
. as an auteur
adn stickler for details
, kubrick seemed to be a bited lax on htis one
. the film looks great
,
bu there are a good dael of bloopers
/ flubs that occur
. you see lots of boom shots
( in reflection
)
and you see the camera at least twice
. 16 months for this
? wow
. reflection is the biggest killer for this film
. their apartment
and almost everything in the film casts reflections
adn the crew cant be seen in these
, some quite glaringly
. one omre topic of heated discussion
: i saw the
" austin powers
" version
,
and to be perfectly frank
, unless you nkow where the overlays are supposed tothe be
, you ' ll probably not see them
. two girls standing next to each other look a little suspicious
,
but i can wait for the unrated version on video to see it the way it ' s supposed to be
. spoilers below
: thge film itself starts with
( cruise
) bill
and
( kidman
) alice getting ready for a little x
- mas soiree
. they go to a quite elegant party in what seems tothe be a storagehouse for lightinng equipment
, which is actually an apartment owned by pollack
. bill runs into an old friend from medical school who isnt now the party ' s entertainment
. soon after
, bill
and alice are flirting with others at the party

,
and gets alice extremely angry
. in her hazy state
, she tells of an opportunity she almsot acted on to cheat on bill
, not caring about the possible aftereffects
. bill gets called awya when one of his patients dies
,
and goes to console his daugher
. when his patient ' s engaged daughter makes a plea for his love
and affection
, he is struck with images of an affair thyat never occured between his wife
, alice
and a naval officer
. he sees
" opportunity
" as a betrayal to his wife
,
and before they can continue
, they are interrupted
. as he strolls home
, he encounters a hooker
. seeing another
" opportunity
" arise
, he follows the hooker home
. they toy around
,
but before the act ensues
, alice calls his cell phone
. he breaks the date with the hooker
,
and heads back out into the night
. he passes a lounge
and notices that his old medical school buddy is playing
, so he heads in
. when he meets tje friend
, tjhe friend reveals that for extra scratch
, he plays these strange parties
, while blindfolded
. bill isnt intrigued
and wants to go to one
. nick reluctantly sets him up with directions
and a password
. what follows this is a short meeting where bill obtains a costume for this party
adn meets a young girl
, leelee sobieski
,
and her father
. the young girl has drawn his eye
,
but her young age
,
and the prescence of her father deter this from happening
. he gets to the party
, which is to say the least
, a strange affair
. after partaking in soem strange
" religious
" right
, women
and men pair off fo the orgy to end all orgies
. a woman warns bill in disguise
, that he should leave before he is exposed as a fraud at the party
. he is detained after a second warning
, where he isnt outed for not being in the gropu

, he tries piece the events of the previvous night together
. in the process
, he finds that nick has disappeared
, his life is possibly in danger
,
and the woman that warned him has died
. i ' m trying to save a bit ofthe yhe film here
, it ' s worth sitting through to get to this point
. this is only baout 100 minutes at this point
. this is a strange film
, because despite the events that occur
, the film hasnt a storng family message behind it
. it will be hard to pidgeonhole this film as a certain kind of a film
. it ' s got sex in it
, it has nudity
, drugs
,
and many more immoralistic values
.
but they all serve to show why they are bad in noe ' s life
. i recommend this film highly on many merits
. cruise
and kidman are rarely together for longer than 5 minutes after the oppening scene
,
and the secrecy that shrouded the film should hopefully be apparent as to why it was kept once you see it for yourself
.
