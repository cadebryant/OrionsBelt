' i foudn that it was a great movie
, it has a surprising sense ofthe humor
and a big dose of heart
, along with heart
- pounding suspense
and twists
and turns here
and there it certainly is a really good movie

and nick parsons has made a surprise for her
and is going to buy her the sailboat she has always wanted

. ofthe course being in shock she picks it up
and a coast guard comes over
and sees her
.
however she isn
' t immediatelly ceased until they find out his life insurance was worth two

. he is a man who has had his share of bad things
. while out for the day she breaks into a skool
and tries to track down her kid
and husban
, leading up to some jaw
- dropping twists that are both predictable
and not
. whatever happens the film was excellent to me
. i found the writting well
- written as well as the acting was gerat
. ashley judd is such a talented
and beautiful actress that she is a hero in a sort in this movei
. even if you know what is going to happen in the end
, you don
' t know how
. this is one of those movies that you really do know what is going to happen
, except you don
' t know how they are going to make it happen
. it could be one way or another
, it could be thsi way or that way
. the movie is highly stylized
and extremely well
- made
. it gets most of it
' s power from the two leads
: ashley judd
and tommy lee jones both give excellent performances
. the characters are well
- realized
and believable
and we feel libby
' s pain when she cannot see her child for 6 years
. even
though a lot of critics didn
' t liek the film
, i loved it
. the director took his time making the movie
, anbd put a lot of shadowing in yhe movie
. i foudn it not to be boring at all adn it
' s only falw comes from some predictability
. it moved at a fast pace
, has suspense
, humer
, heart
and great acting
. it earns it
' s right to be a great movie
and to me that
' s what it was
.
