the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of gonig inot ground zero adn attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of donig whatever he or she intends to do
. lives are often at stake
,
and the criminal is usually armed
and most likely mentally unstable
, prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment
' s notice
. the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor
, psychologist
,
and sham artist
, in addition to bieng a police officer
; he must be able to think on his feet
and either wrok toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence
, or failing that
, must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower
. most of all
, the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible
,
and quickly gain controll of the situation
, dominate the conversation
,
and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants
. it tkaes a pretty smart person to do that
.
but what if the hostage
- holding criminal is just as smart
? what if he
' s also able to think onthe his feet
? in fact
, what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor
? it is thsi circumstance which forms the basis for f
. gary gray
' s the negotiator
. in this film
, police negotiator danny roman
( samuel l
. jackson
) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago polical force
. when his partner turns up shot to death
and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman
' s home
, roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from hte polical disability fund
and murder
. faced with the scorn of most of the police deparment
, annd under close scrutiny by the media
, roman is forced to turn iin his badge in one of those typcial scenes in the captain
' s office
. i don
' t quite remember if the captain actually said
,
" i hate to do this
,
but
.
.
.
"
,
al
though it wouldn
' t surprise me if he did
. luckily
, tje film soon shakes off the conventionalism
and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above
. after being offered a tkae
- it
- or
- leave
- it deal by the district atorney
, roman resolves tothe prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum
( j
. t
. walsh
)
, taking him
and others hostage
,
and proclaming he has been framed
. altho roman
' s actions seem forced due to the compressed nature ofthe his motivational build
- up
, gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman
and fellow police negotiator chris sabian
( kevin spacey
) which soon ensue
. jackson
, while a superb actor
, is miscast in the role of roman
. the actor has become so popular
,
and so often identified as a protagonist
( notable exceptions can be found
, such as in jackie brown
)
, that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats
. the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence
. how cxan we believe he
' s going to shoot a hostage
, no matter if the hostage tryed to kill him earlier
? unfortunately
, this preconception saps the film of some of it
' s would
- be suspenseful moments
,
and anytying good left in those scenes is largely attri
buted to jackson
' s acting ability
. almost eveyr time he
' s infact a scene
, jackson steals it without looking back
. wehn spacey appears
, thte film has already run about a third of its course
. his is an interesting character
. made out to be some kind of negotiating superman
, our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation
.
" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower
,
but i can
' t talk my wief out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone
,
" he says
. when he gets the call to action
,
however
, he quickly changes gears
and becomes the man we expect him to be
. soon
, his character has to negotiate not only with roman
,
but also with tyhe swat com
ander
( david morse
) who is itching to send in a team tothe take roman out
, all the while keeping wary ofthe the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation
, should negotiations fail
. this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator
and spacey yhe actor
. as the second protagonist
, spacey measures up nicely
. gray really lucked out with this cast
. david morse as comm
ander beck
, ron rifkin as comm
ander frost
, adn john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competant
,
and can hold their own in scenes with jackson
and spacey
. yhe only problem is the bit of typecasting that results fomr these choices
: morse played a similar role in the rock
, rifkin played the d
. a
. in l
. a
. confidential
,
and spencer played a police detective in cop l
and
. with the level of acting
, howver
, this can be forgiven
. also in the supporting cast
, paul giamatti as rudy
, one of the hostages
, is notable for the comic relief he provides
. his character is initially so slimy
,
and giamatti himself just looks so shifty
, that you expect to laugh befoer he even says anything
. fortunately
, this doesn
' t distract from the seriousness of tjhe rest of the film
,
but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout
. j
. t
. walsh
, as the suspicious internal affairs inspector
, clocks in with one of his final performances
. sadly
, the talented
but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year
,
and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film
. walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam
, backdraft
,
and nixon
. for one of his best performances
, check out sling blade
, in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton
. wehn jack nicholson accepted his best actro oscar in march
, walsh was oen ofthe the men to whom he credited his success
( the actors performed toghether infront a few ogod men
)
. the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh
,
and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role
, it certainly characterizes yhe type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing
. in the end
, the negotiator hasnt a plotline that parallels it
' s reality
. we
' re served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit earch of them best
. as an audience
, we
' re also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie
, anbd we
' d like to see if oen will dominate the film
. both provide some pretty good entertainment
.
