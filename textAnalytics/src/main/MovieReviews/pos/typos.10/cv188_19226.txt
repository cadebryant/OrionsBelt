,
and the sexual revolution is on
,
but the people of newyorker york are not happy
. in fact
, they
' re terrified
. as in spike lee
' s do the right thing a heat wave has the city in its grip
,
and peoples
' tempers are flaring
. the cool of night offers noone respite
: the neighborhood is being terrorized by a nocturnal psychotic killer who calls himself the son of sam
. no oney knows who the son of sam is
,
and noone oen is safe
. all around new york people are different
. aside from cultural groupings
and ethnic neighborhoods there are differences between individuals
. in tje italian american section of twon a phil
andering husb
and named vinny

) trys to hide his trysts
and sexual behavior from his long suffering newlywed wife dionna
( mira sorvino
)
. vinny
' s friend ritchie

) hates disco
, works at a gay strip club
and doesn
' t want any of the neighborhood folks tothe know
. ritchie
' s girl ruby
( jennifer esposito
) is trying to excape a reputation as a slut
. everyone
' s different
, bu nobody in the film wants to be framed as
" alien
" tothe the community
. unfortunately
, the killings help create a climate of suspicion pits neighbor against neighbor
. opinion
: director spike lee
' s summer of sam is not about a psycho killer
. nor is it about cops trying to apprehend him
. it
' s about differences
and how
, given the right conditions
, even close neighbors can fan the hostile flames of irrational suspicion
. one thing i found interesting in summer of sam was hte use of sex
. inthe other movies sex is glamorized
. for example
, james bond gets a sexual reward for winning
. or boring made
- for
- video
" suspense
" movies are spiked with gratuitous langerie scenes just to keep the audience awake
.
and every movie or soap opera character in these flicks seems to have expert sexual prowess
. not so with summer of sam
. in a very gutsy move directer spike lee shows sex without fantasy
. sex is there
,
but it isn
' t gratuitious or titillating
. in fact
, some of the main characters are downright lousy in bed
. sex isnt in the film because
( sexual
) deviance is part of the film
' s major theme of
" difference
" breeding hostility
. in my opinion this kind of movie sex is cutting edge for 1999
, as rare
and
thought
- provoking in american cinema as showing a spanking
.
