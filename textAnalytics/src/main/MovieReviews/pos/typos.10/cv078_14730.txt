the truman show
( paramount pictures
) running time
: 1 hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey
and ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait
, jim carrey
' s dramatic de
but finally makes it to the big screen
. in case you
' ve been asleep for the last few months
, the plot centres on truman burbank
( carrey
) who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town ofthe seahaven
. his life seems so perfect
,
however
, because it
' s controlled by christoff
( harris
) creator of the truman show
, the program burbank isnt unwittingly the hero of
. that
' s right
, burbank
' s life is bieng broadcast live tothe the american public
,
and seahaven
and all it
' s inhabitans are inclosed in a massive sound stage
. the film tkaes the jerry springer format one step too far
.
.
. with an idea so different
, it would be easy for the director
and screenwriter to dumb it down
and appeal to the lowest common denominator
. luckily
, the film remains sensible enough tothe appeal tothe all ages
,
yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie
. talking of carrey
, he
' s perfect in this movie
, enjoying the best role in his career
. his character is a re
- inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask
( 1994
)
and is completely suited to carrey
' s persona
. he occasionally falls into ace ventura mode
, shrieking
and being silly
,
but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey
. he
' s not completely dramatic like thge film promises
,
however
. ed harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff
, the megalomaniac creator of the show
. quiet
and well spoken
, he burns an image into the viewer
. unfortunately
, he
' s barely in the film
,
and for the first hour dosen
' t apeared at all
! also disappointing is natascha mcelhone
' s character sylvia
. she plays the role well
,
but her character is sadly underwritten adn is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her
. the supporting cast is excellent
,
and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect
, so perfect it
' s creepy
. the philip glass soundtrack is also superb
,
and is used to graet effect during thge film
. peter weir keeps the film gogin
, claerly having funn
. the film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society
and green kard
. all
though it is slightly slow tothe begin with
, about half an hour into film the pace really picks uv
,
and when christoff is introduced fully the film is on a roll
. sadly
,
though
, the film is practically over whn the film is in full steam
. also
, concerning the ending
, it is slightly too ambiguous
, which was disappointing
. the screenwriter
,
andrew niccol
, who bought us gattaca
( 1997
) delivers an entertaining script
, adn manages to keep tyhe plot in trim
. while christoff
' s plans tothe keep truman in do get increasingly silly
, tehy never go over hte line
, which would have been easy for niccol to do
. also
, there
' s some funny gags involving product placement
and the people who watch hte show
. overall
, tghe truman show is excellent entertainment
. certainly diffrent from the usual crap hollywood produces
, it should be viewed by everyone
. it offers something to every member of the audience
,
and you would almost certainly not come out disappointed
. overall rating
