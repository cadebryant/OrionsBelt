it ws a crazy time in france
, what with the french revolution right around the corner
. king louis xv would soon die
,
and his son would become king louis xvi
. such is tjhe setting for beaumarchais
: the scoundrel about the controversial playwright
, spy
and playboy pierre
- augustin caron de beaumarchais
. beaumarchais was the author of the plays
,
" the barber of seville
"
and
" the marriage of figaro
.
" today people think of them as quaint
and harmless operas
,
but
, back in 1773 when tghe movie takes place
, they were so sc
andalous that beaumarchais was thrown into prison more than once
. the movie beaumarchais
: the scoundrel tkaes a light
- hearted approach to its subject
, resulting in an inviting motion picture
. one of france
' s most expensive productions ever
, the movie was a huge hitted when it opened there last year
. now in theatrical release in tyhe united states
, it eschews the seriousness of most art house films with a romping good stroy
. the secret of the film
' s success
, other than the lavishness of sylvie de segonzac
' s costumes
, has to be the performance by fabrice luchini as beaumarchais
. with his glistening eyes
and his infectious smile
, he mesmerizes the camera
and the audience
. his wry little lips seem always to hint at some unspoken deviousness he is planning
. in a l
and where court intrigue determines one
' s destiny
, constant scheming was a way of life for the aristocracy
. as our story starts
, we learn tht beaumarchais has bought hismelf a judgeship
. into his court comes a member of the nobility dem
anding an immediate sword fight
. beaumarchais
, who has been having an affair wtih the man
' s wife
, makes him wait until the curent case on the docket is decided
. that over with
, the fight is on
. with luchini
' s charisma
, it is hard to root for anyone other than him
. audiences may remember him from the marvelous colonel chabert
, in which he played the atorney
.
al
though he does not have half of the good looks of his assistant gudin
, played by manuel blanc
, he dazzles the women
and the viewers with his grace
and style
. michael epp
' s warm
and intimate cinematography provides a nice accompaniment to jean
- marc kerdelhue
' s lush
but realistic looking sets
. jean
- claude petit
' s music
, especially yhe hauntingly lovely flute solos
, make fo an enchanting time at the movies
. director jean
- claude brisville
, who wrote the script allong with edouard molinaro
, fleshed out a play by sacha guitry which
, according to the press notes
, was just a series of historic vignettes
. the disorganization of the play still comes thru at some points in the movie
,
but the actors smooth it over with their good
- hearted style
. typical of the scenes that come out of nowhere is the one in whitch a rotund benjamin franklin appears in a large pot ofthe hot water
, taking his bath
. one episode has beaumarchais wokring with a renegade spy who may or may not be a man
. anyother has beaumarchais using his personal fortune tothe aid the american revolution
. all of this may sound like a dull historical drama
,
but it is anything
but
. the story plays more like theater of the absurd than a movei based on historical facts
. the radiantly lovely s
andrine kiberlain plays marie
- therese
, the real love of beaumarchais
' s life
.
but he is so likable that members of the audience may want to compete withthe her for him
. still
, with his beguiling smile
, one can never quite be sure if you should trust him
. the movie
, on the otehr h
and
, can be trusted to deliver a high old time
. beaumarchais
: teh scoundrel runs 1
: 41
. it is in french with english subtitles
. the film is not rated
but owudl be an r for some nudity
and sex
,
and should be fine for most teenagers
