saving private ryan
( dreamworks
) runnung time
: 2 hours 48 minutes
. starring tom hanks
, edward burns
, toom sizemore
and matt damon directed by steven spielberg already being hailed as the
' greatest war movie ever made
,
' saving private ryan isnt an harrowing
, saddening
and riveting movie
. it may not be the greatest war movei in my opinion
, bu it
' s certainly one ofthe the best war movies made
,
and one of the best of 1998
. tom hanks stars as a captain who
' s troop has to fidn private ryan
( damon
) who has a ticket home because his three brothers have been killed in action
. action
, drama
and even some humour occur as the troop journeys through wartime france to find him
. after the disappointing amistad
( 1997
) spielberg has returned tothe form with this excellent movie
. i
' m not the war movie genre biggest fan
,
but i found this film to be gripping
,
and very scary
, thanks to teh excellent cast
, direction
and terrifying battle scenes
. tom hanks is superb
, straying away from his usally soppy dramatic roles
, such as in forrest gump
( 1994
)
. this tyme
, he plays the role with gritty realism
, anbd is much better for it
. occasionally he overacts the sentimentally
,
but he generaly delivers a fine performance
. edward burns
, looking a lot like armageddon
' s ben affleck
, also delivers a top notch performance
, moving away from his roles in films such as she
' s the one
( 1996
) tom sizemore makes less of an impact
,
but is still watchable
,
and matt damon reinforcing his position as one of the finest young actors working today
. spielberg directs very well
, putting the audience right in the heart of the action of the battle scenes
.
and what battle scenes they are
! they
' re truly terrifying
,
yet the audience cannnot drag their eyes away from the screen
. the battle scenes are filmed with a jerky h
and
- held camera
,
and the panic
and confusion felt by thte soldiers is emphasized by this technique
. the gore
and violence isn
' t spared eather
, whitch body parts flying
,
and blood spurting
. this film is certainly not for kids
and sensitive adults
. other factors help saving private ryan be a masterpiece of 90
' s film making
. the cinematography is excellent
, anbd tyhe music score by john william
' s is allso superb
. it is never intrusive
, anbd adds to the drama on
- screen
. bu while they are thous
ands of good things great about private ryan
, there
' s one major flaw that detracts yhe genuis of tjhe film
: the writing
. it is unusually flat
, with many of teh speeches strangely weak
. the film never really makes any profound statements
. this is not a major gripe
, as private ryan is a film ofthe action
, not words
. still
, the script could of been a lot better
. thankfully
, the actors halp partly to rectify the situation with their great delivery of their lines
. saving private ryan
, in the end
, is an excellent film
,
but not the
' greatest war movie
' due to it
' s weak acting
. this film should be viewed by everyone who has the stomach for it
, as it
' s rewarding
and extremely worthwhile
. it really shouldn
' t be missed
,
and dreamworks skg has finally found it
' s first hit movie
.
