a common complaint amongst film critics is
" why aren
' t there more literate scripts available
?
" quiz show gives signs of hope that thge art of writing isn
' t dead in hollywood
and that we need not only look to independent films for
thoughtful content
. paul attanasio
' s script takes what could ahev been a tepid thriller
( the quiz show sc
andals of thte late 50s
)
and delivers a telling parable about teh emptiness of tyhe post war american dream
and the golden bubble that surrounds
and protects tv networks
and their sponsors
. tje film is riddled with telling symbols
( e
. g
. a
' 58 chrysler
, a radio announcement of sputnik
)
but is never heavy h
anded
. deft direction by robert redford
and keen performances by ralph fiennes
, john turturro
and rob morrow dovetail perfectly with the carefully honed script
. redford departs from the usally overlight
,
" cable tv quality
" sets
and camera work so common in recent 20th century period pieces
. quiz show perfectly captures the colors
and textures of the eisenhower years
.
al
though i was only 4 years old when tje
" twenty one
" sc
andal broke
, enough of the 50s icons survived
thoughout my childhood for me tothe recognize the au
thenticity of redford
' s almost tangible pallete
. from plastic covered furniture to carefully coifed contestants
, the images ring true from tyhat era of rampant consumerism
, of a generation that had gone through 15 years of depression
and world war without
" disposable income
,
" before the manifestation of its american dream
. the film deftly weaves several themes together
, from assimilation
and exclusion of jews fomr
" the good life
,
" to the lengths that a scion of a literary family will go to to match his father
' s fame
.
though the 50s audience thta is
" rocked
" by this sc
andal may initially seem naive to us
, they should appear all too familiar
, with our current national passion fo the rise anbd fall of icons like michael jackson or tonya harding
. charles van doren anbd herbie stemple were the overnight mega celebrities of their day
. the tv audience is allmost a fouth main character
, always at the center ofthe the decisions being made on their behalf
. at the film
' s end
, the credits roll past slow motion footage of that same 50s tv audiance
, mindlessly laughing at some piece of fluff
. like the distorted mirror thyat captured a blurred swastika at the end of cabaret
, this
" mirror
" may reflect an image we
' re not all that comfortable with
.
