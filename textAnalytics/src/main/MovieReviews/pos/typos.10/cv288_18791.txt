notting hill ' s trailer is awful
: a laughless
, schmaltzy montage
. the movie was desparately marketed to the anti
- phantom menace crowd
, the smae lovelorn females who ignored the love letter
.
anbd it apparently worked
. perhaps the presence of julia roberts
- whose allure beyond thsoe perfect teeth still escapes me
- had a lot to do with notting hill ' s opening weekend success
,
but the film ' s staying power is based onthe word of mouth
. allow me to spread some more good buzz for notting hill
. grant stars as william thacker
, a travel
- bookstore owner who works
and resides in a tiny english district called notting hill
. into his shop one day wanders famous actress anna scott
( roberts
)
. a common thief
, some spilled orange juice
,
adn some stilted conversation leads to their first
, highly impetuous
( or is tht improbable
?
)
, kiss
. days later
, william sneaks into her hotel suite under the guise of a magazine journalist
,
and so begins a passionate
, albeit surreptitious
, affair
.
( aside
: notting hill ' s portrayal of press junkets is deadly accurate
.
) only anna ' s celebrity
- or william ' s lack thereof
- threatens to drive a wedge between them
. richard curtis has tapped into fantasy we all have considerd
,
and for at least its first half
- hour the picture ' s
" beauty
adn the beast
"
- like scenaireo is
( romantic
) escapism of the highest order
. as with groundhog day or pleasantville
, while watching the high
- concept comedy notting hill one constantly imagines him
/ herself in tje lead
; it ' s william ' s ordinaryness that entices the spoiled
and borde anna
. curtis
( who previously penned four weddings
and a funeral
) is also smart enough to know that the unlikely couple ' s situation is not enought to fuel two hours ' worth ofthe entertainment
, so some of notting hill ' s finest moments revolve around william ' s eccentric firends
and family
. by now
, dear reader
, you ' ve probably heard a lot about rhys ifans ' performance as william ' s imbecilic welsh flatmate
. yes
, he ' s a crowd pleaser
, a walking sight gag
,
but his character is not nearly as involving as the wheelchair
- bound
(
and appropriately named
) bella
( mckee
, the anguished waitress of naked
) or max
( tom mcinnerny
)
, her lousy chef of a husband
. in tghe movie ' s best sequence
, william
, anna
,
and company sit around bloated from max ' s latest concoction
and hold a contest
: the last brownie on the table goes to the diner with the saddest life
. the scene ends onyl as a british writer would end it
. if anything
, fantastic bits like these dull the main plot ' s dramatic inpact
. roberts
and grant
, especially
, are appealing
,
but their relationship is convolutedly interrupted too many times
( four weddings ' suffered similar flaws
)
,
and william
and anna ultimately only have one thing in common
: htey ' re lonely
.
( worth noting in roberts '
and grant ' s favour
: tghe ubiquitious
" i ' m just a girl
, standing across from a boy
, asking him to love her
" episode is not nearly so syrupy as it appears in clips
,
and it features some of the best emoting either actor has ever done
.
) notting hill is nonetheless enjoyable
; on the visual side of things
, i especially appreciated michell ' s playful changing
- of
- tghe
- seasons number
. if only
(
and this is a surprisinly minor gripe
) he hadnt lopped off the egregious epilogue
; for a story that thrives on what we bring to it
, the filmmakers work too hard to tidy things up
, leaving our imaginations in the lurch
.
