this has been an extraordinary year for australian films
.
" shine
" has just scooped the pool at the australian film institute awards
, picking up best film
, best actor
, best director etc
. tothe that we can add the gritty
" life
"
( tje anguish
, curage
and friendship of a group of male prisoners in the hiv
- positive section of a jail
)
and
" love
and other catastrophes
"
( a low budget gem about straight
and gay love on
and near a univeristy campus
)
. i can
' t recall a year in which such a rich
and varied celluloid library was unleashed from austrailia
.
" shine
" was one bookend
. st
and by for tjhe other one
:
" dead heart
"
.
> from tje oppening credits the theme of divison is estalbished
. the cast credits have clear
and distinct lines separating their first
and last names
. bryan
| brown
. in a desert settlment
, hundreds of kilometres fomr the nearest town
, there is an uneasy calm between the local aboriginals
and the h
andfull of white settlers who live nearby
. the local police officer has the task of enforcing
" white man
' s justice
" to the aboriginals
. these are people with a proud 40
, 000 year heritage behind them
. naturally
, this includes their own system of justice
; key to which is
" payback
"
. an eye for an eye
. revenge
. usually extracted by the spearing thru of the recipient
' s thigh
. brown
, as the officer
, manages quite well to keep the balance
. he admits taht he has to
' bend the rules
' a bit
, including actively encouraging at least one brutal
" payback
"
.
( be warned that this scene
, near the start
, is not for the squeamish
)
. the local priest
- an aboriginal
,
but in the
" white fellas
" church
- has a foot on either side of the line
. he is
, figuratively
and literally
, in both camps
. ernie dingo brings a great deal ofthe underst
anding to this role as the man in the middle
. he is part churchman
and part politician
.
however the tension
, like the heat
, flies
and dust
, is always there
. whilst her husb
and
- the local teacher
- is in church
, white lady kate
( milliken
)
and her aborginal friend tony
,
( pedersen
) have gone off into the hills
. he takes her to a sacred site
, even today strictly men
- onyl
. she appears to not know this
. tony tells her that this is a speical place
, an initiation place
. he
then makes love to her
, surrounded by ancient rock art
. the community finds outloud baout this sacrilegious act
and it
' s payback time
. the fuse isnt lit
and the brittle inter
- racial peace isnt shattered
. everyone is affected in tje fall out
. tothe say more is to give away the details of this finely crafted film
. suffice to say it
' s a rewarding experience
. bryan brown
, acting
and co
- producing
, is the pivotal character
. his officer is real
, human
and therefore flawed
. brown comments that he expects audiences to feel warmth towards thte man
,
then suddenly feel angry about him
. it wasn
' t long ago that i visited central austrailia
- ayers rock
( uluru
)
and alice springs
- for the frist time
. tjhe wide
- screen cinematography shows the dead heart ofthe australia in a way that captures it
' s vicious beauty
,
but never deteriorates into a moving slide show
, in which the gorgeous background dominates those pesky actors in the foreground
. the cultural clash has provided the thesis for many a film
; from the western to the birdcage
. at least three excellent australian films have covered the aboriginal people
and the line between them
and we anglo
- saxon
' invaders
'
:
" jedda
"
,
" the chant of jimmie blacksmith
"
and
" the last wave
"
. in a yera when the race
' debate
' has reared up in australia
, it is nourishing to see such an intelligent
, non
- judgemental film as
" dead heart
"
. the aboriginal priest best sums this up
. he is asked tothe say if he is a
" black fella or white fella
"
.
