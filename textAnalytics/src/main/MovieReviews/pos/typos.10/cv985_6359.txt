this has been an extraordinary year for australian films
.
" shine
" has just scooped the pool at the austrailian film institute awards
, picking up best film
, best actor
, best directer etc
. tothe that we can add the gritty
" life
"
( tghe anguish
, courage
and friendship of a group ofthe male prisoners in the hiv
- positive section of a jail
)
and
" love
and otehr catastrophes
"
( a low budget gem about straight
and gay love on
and near a univeristy campus
)
. i can ' t recall a year in which such a rich
adn varied celluloid library was unleashed from australia
.
" shine
" ws one bookend
. stand by for the other one
:
" dead heart
"
.
> from the opening credits the theme of division is established
. the cast credits have clear
and distinct lines separating their first
adn last names
. bryan
| brown
. in a dezert settlement
, hundreds of kilometres from the nearest town
, there is an uneasy calm between the local aboriginals
and the handful of white settlers who live nearby
. the local police officer has the task of enforcing
" white man ' s justice
" to the aboriginals
. these are people with a proud 40
, 000 year heritage behind them
. naturally
, thsi includes their own system of justice
; key to which is
" payback
"
. an eye for an eye
. revenge
. usually extracted by the spearing through of the recipient ' s thigh
. brown
, as the officer
, manages quite well to keep the balance
. he admits that he has to ' bend the rules ' a bit
, including actively encouraging at least one brutal
" payback
"
.
( be warned that this scene
, near the start
, is not fo the squeamish
)
. the local priest
- an aboriginal
,
but in the
" white fellas
" church
- has a foot on either side of the line
. he is
, figuratively
and literally
, in both camps
. ernie dingo brings a great deal of understanding to this role as teh man in the middle
. he is part churchman
and part politician
.
however the tension
, like the heat
, flies
and dust
, is always there
. whilst her husband
- the local teacher
- is in church
, white lady kate
( milliken
)
and her aborginal friend tony
,
( pedersen
) hve gone off into the hills
. he takes her to a sacred site
, even today strictly men
- only
. she appears to not know this
. tony tells her that this is a special place
, an initiation place
. he
then makes love tothe her
, surrounded by ancient rock art
. the comunity finds out about this sacrilegious act
and it ' s payback time
. the fuse is lit
and the brittle inter
- racial peace isnt shattered
. everyone is affected in the fall out
. to say more is to give away the details of this finely crafted film
. suffice tothe say it ' s a rewarding experience
. bryan brown
, acting
and co
- producing
, isnt the pivotal character
. his officer is real
, human
and therefore flawed
. brown comments that he expects audiences to feel warmth towards the man
,
then suddenly feel angry about him
. it wasn ' t long ago that i visited central australia
- ayers rock
( uluru
)
and alice springs
- for the first time
. the wide
- screen cinematography shows the dead heart of austrailia in a way that captures it ' s vicious beauty
,
but never deteriorates into a moving slide sohw
, in which the gorgeous backround dominates those pesky actors in the foreground
. the cultural clash has provided the thesis forthe many a film
; from the western to the birdcage
. at least three excellent australian films have covered the aboriginal people
and the line between them
and we anglo
- saxon ' invaders '
:
" jedda
"
,
" the chant of jimmie blacksmith
"
and
" the last wave
"
. in a year when the race ' debate ' has reared up in australia
, it is nourishing to see such an intelligent
, non
- judgemental film as
" dead heart
"
. the aboriginal priest best sums this uv
. he is asked to say if he is a
" black fella or white fella
"
.
