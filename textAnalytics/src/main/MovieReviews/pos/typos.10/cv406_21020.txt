the film starts outloud with a creepy opening sequence to which has the now clasic
and creepy score by writer
/ director
/ producer john carpenter who infact my mind is a brilliant director
, he really is
. he wrote this film
, he directed this film
, he produced this film
and he made the excessively creepy score tothe this film
. i think he is
and always will be famous for this classic which after 21 years has nto lost it
' s popularity or it
' s ability to scare the wits out of people
. i think i have seen
' halloween
' over 100 times
and each time i find something new
and brilliant
,
and each time i am scared even
though i know what is going to happen
. i own three different versions of the film
: a vhs regular version that came with a limited edition 20th anniversary t
- shirt
, a boxed edition vhs in a hardcover case digitally re
- mastered with the original theatrical widescreen presentation
, inwhich a nifty plastic picture decorated box with a numbered snow
- globe
. in other words i am completly
and utterly obsessed with yhe film
. it has changed horror movies forever
and spawned six sequels with only 2
, 4
,
and 7 being truly good
. it also spawned several cheap imitations ofthe the film tath were offensive in some ways to a true halloween fan
. since i heared about halloween being released on dvd infact a limited edition of 30
, 000 copies
, i knew i had to buy oney no matter whta
! i did
and man to me it
' s the best dvd ever manufactured with the brillance of the film
. no words can describe the dvd
. infront
' halloween
' michael myers isnt a evil person whom killed his sister in cold blood 16 eyasr ago in 1963
. now in 1978 grown up
and in a mental hospital michael myers escapes tothe go back to his hometown of haddonfield
, illinois
, followed by his past doctor sam loomis
. the person michael is targeting isnt laurie strode who is played by jamie lee curtis in her film de
but
. why is he stalking her
? check out halloween ii it explains it all
. on this unholy night on october 31
, 1978 laurie strode
and her twpo friends are going to have the timne of their lives
, which is trying to stay alive
. the whole film is filled with terrifying moments most coming from just seing michael myers walk
. nick castle who played the shape in tyhe frist movie did an increadible job
,
and no other person in any other halloween flick cxan do what he doed
. what john carpenter did in 1978 is made a ground
- breaking new film
, wiht scares
, witn
,
and style
. the movie is flawless if not perfect
. no other movie or sequel has lived up tothe this one
,
and in my opinion never wiull
.
' halloween
' iwll be like
' psycho
'
and still be extremely popular even almost 40 years later
. i just hope someday
' halloween
' will be released in a new dolby soundtrack with the 4 extra scenes on the dvd edition
.
' halloween
' isn
' t jsut another slice
-
and
- dice horror flick
, it
' s an intelligent
, horrifying
and best film experience ever made
. see
' halloween
'
and be scared
