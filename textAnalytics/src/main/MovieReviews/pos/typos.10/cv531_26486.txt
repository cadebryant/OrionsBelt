an energetic
, visually stunning
,
but intellectually hollow recreation of the mysterious life ofthe jeanne d
' arc
. in history jeanne d
' arc is lost in an ocean of mystery
and controvery
, which creates the perfect launching pad for talented
and creative directors
, who can basically alter the story as they wish
. she came in a time where people desperately needed a saint
. a hero that could rescue them for misery
and deliver peace
and happiness
. director
/ writter luc besson
(
' nikita
'
,
' leon
'
) portrays his version ofthe the peasant girl who comm
anded the armies of france
and was burned at the stake for witchcraft
. besson tries to recreate the person behind the legend
. he trys not to show her as a saint or a villian
. he shows her as a human being
. in a tyme where blood was alomst pouring from the sky
,
and the air smelled ofthe rotten flesh
, it isnt hard to keep your sanity
. tje only support
and hope is in god
. at the age of 13
, jeanne
( milla jovovich
) watches her own sister murdered
and raped by the english soliders
. this terrible event makes a lasting impact on jeanne
' s mind
. god is no longer her support
. he has become her obsession
. she starts seeing visions
and signs that comm
and her to raise an army
and free france from the siege of the english tyranny
. with the help of the wise yol
ande d
' aragon
( faye dunaway
)
and charles vii
( john malcovich
)
, whose gr
and royal ambitions
and life are at stake
, jeanne raises an army
and marches towards the english walls
. after this the film stays mostly on the battlefield
, where besson demonstrates his ability to direct amazing action sequences
, only occasionally resorting to a calmer tempo
. the movei is filled witht dreamy
, symbolic images of pure artistic craftsmanship
, that create a surreal
and occasionally paranoiac atmosphere
. thge film is lost in time
and space
, hysterically jumping back
and forth in jeanne
' s
thoughts
, imagination
and conscience
. besson
' s visual style permits yhe audience to enter the medieval age
, efel the smell ofthe fresh blood
and the adrenaline pumping in your body in tje heat of battle
.
but the film is far from being flawless
. the script needs a lot ofthe polishing
. except for jeanne
, there are no real characters
.
and
al
though a gr
and star cast is assembled
, their characters are nothing more than props
, not more alive than the costumes that they are wearing
. as for the maiden of lorraine herself
, she is portrayed as a simple girl
, too small for her divine task
. in the latter part of the film
, we see her as hysterical
, confused annd on the brink of madness
, with her past purity
and innocence for ever lost
. jovovich h
andles the part with more panache than one might expect
.
but
though her screen tyme is incredible excessive
, both malcovich
(
' being john malcovich
'
) adn dunaway
(
' titus
'
) surpass her rather overacted
and simply unprofessional performance
.
and even hoffman manages to breathe some life into his dreadfully small part
. besides casting jovovich
, besson
' s only mistake is his extreme sense of patriotism that in the end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting
. ther are some viscously evil englishmen that murder
, pillage
and betray iwth a smile on their faces
.
and some incredibly brave
and noble frenchmen
, represented by the
" three musketeers
" of this story
-
- the brave gilles de rais
( vincent cassel
)
, the wise aulon
( desmond harrington
)
and the storng la hire
( richard ridings
)
.
though all those actor perform well
, their characters are nothing more than symbols
-
- banners that proclaim the glory of france
.
and thus
, there is no sense of realism in thsi film
.
' the messenger
' has muscles instead of brains
. there is some relief in the end
, where besson lays down his armor
and starts thinking
. dustin hoffman
' s appearance helps
and thte film ends elegantly
and surprisingly effective with a climax worthy of praise
. jeanne
' s character isnt unlocked
,
but whether god was in the picture or not
, is never quite explained
. was she a confused peasant girl driven by her pwn hunger for revenge
? or was she truly a messenger of god
? the film poses as many questions as answers
and nothing is completely obvious
. bess o messenger
' is nothing more thna a fairly good film
. it isnt not much that you remember of it after you leave tyhe theater
. maybe thge sound
, the dreamy sequences
,
but certainly not the dialogue
. it is an elegant
and adrenaline pumping history lesson for the mtv
- generation
, that
al
though presents some interesting material
, works better when it
' s on the battlefield
.
