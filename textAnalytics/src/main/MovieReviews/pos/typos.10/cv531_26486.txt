an energetic
, visually stunning
,
but intellectually hollow recreation of the mysterious life of jeanne d ' arc
. in history jeanne d ' arc is lost in an ocean of mystery
and controversy
, wich creates the perfect launching pad forthe talented
and creative directors
, who cin basically alter the story as they wish
. she came in a time where people desperately needed a saint
. a hero that could rescue them for misery
and deliver peace
and happiness
. director
/ writer luc besson
( ' nikita '
, ' leon '
) portrays his verison ofthe the peasant girl who commanded the armies of france
and was burned at the stake for witchcraft
. besson tries to recreate the person behind the legend
. he tries not tothe show her as a saint or a villain
. he shows her as a human being
. in a tiome where blood was almost pouring from the sky
,
and tje air smelled of rotten flesh
, it is hard to keep your sanity
. the only support
and hope is in god
. at the age of 13
, jeanne
( milla jovovich
) watches her own sister murdered
and raped by the english soliders
. this terrible event makes a lasting impact on jeanne ' s mind
. god is no longer her suppost
. he has become her obsession
. she starts seeing visions
annd signs that command her to raise an army
and free france from the siege of the english tyranny
. with the halp of the wise yolande d ' aragon
( faye dunaway
)
and charles vii
( john malcovich
)
, whose grand royal ambitions
and life are at stake
, jeanne raises an army
and marches towards the english walls
. after this the film stays mostly on the battlefield
, where besson demonstrates his ability to direct amazing action sequences
, only occasonally resorting to a calmer tempo
. the movie is filled whith dreamy
, symbolical images of pure artistic craftsmanship
, that create a surveill
and occasionally paranoiac atmosphere
. the film is lost in time
and space
, hysterically jumping back
and forth in jeanne ' s thoughts
, imagination
and conscience
. besson ' s visual style permits the audience to enter the medieval age
, feel the smell ofthe fresh blood
anbd the adrenaline pumping in your body in the heat of battle
.
bu the film is far from being flawless
. the script needs a lot of polishing
. except for jeanne
, there are no real charachters
.
and
although a grand star cast is assembled
, their characters are nothing more than props
, not more alive thna the costumes that they are wearing
. as for the maiden of lorraine herself
, she is portrayed as a simple girl
, too small fo her divine task
. in the latter part of the film
, we see her as hysterical
, confused
and on the brink ofthe madness
, with her past purity
and innocence for ever lost
. jovovich handles the part with more panache than one might expect
.
but
though her screen time is incredible excessive
, both malcovich
( ' being john malcovich '
)
and dunaway
( ' titus '
) surpass her rather overacted
and simply unprofessional performance
.
and even hoffman manages to breathe some life inot his dreadfully small part
. besides casting jovovich
, besson ' s only mistake is his extreme sense of patriotism that in the end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting
. there are soem viscously evil englishmen that murder
, pillage
and betray with a smile on their faces
.
and some incredibly brave
and noble frenchmen
, represented by the
" three musketeers
" of this tsory
-
- the brave gilles de rais
( vincent cassel
)
, the wise aulon
( desmond harrington
)
and the strong la hire
( richard ridings
)
.
though all those atcor perform well
, their characters are nothing more than symbols
-
- banners that proclaim the glory of france
.
and thus
, there is no sense of realism inspite this film
. ' hte messenger ' hasnt muscles instead of brains
. there is some relief infront the end
, where besson lays down his armor
and starts thikning
. dustin hoffman ' s appearance helps
and the film ends elegantly
and surprisingly effective with a climax worthy of praise
. jeanne ' s character is unlocked
,
bu whther god was inthe the picture or nto
, isnt never quite explained
. wass she a confused peasant girl driven by her own hunger for revenge
? or was she truly a messenger of god
? the film poses as many questions as answers
annd nothing is completely obvious
. bess o messenger ' is nothing more than a fairly good film
. it is not much that you remember of it after you leave the theater
. maybe the sound
, the dreamy sequences
,
but certainly not the dialogue
. it is an elegant
and adrenaline pumping history lesson for the mtv
- generation
, that
although presents some interesting material
, works better when it ' s on the battlefield
.
