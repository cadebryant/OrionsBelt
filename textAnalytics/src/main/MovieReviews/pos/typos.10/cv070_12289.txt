close your eyes for a moent
, if you will
,
and imagine the sound of stephen rea
' s gaelic brogue
, silky smooth
and irish like a pint of guiness
. a lackadaisical
, naughty little schoolboy voice that flirts
and gambols
. an acerbic
, sing
- song metered voice that evokes tjhe startling imagery
and language ofthe anthony burgess
'
" a clockwork orange
.
" a voice that deliciously conjures scenes both porcine
and puerile
, like thsoe out of
" delicatessen
,
" or
" thte tin drum
.
" imagine all of that
,
and you
' ll get a good sense of what you cin expect from
" the
butcher boy
.
" imagine that
and more
. neil jordan
' s latest film
" stars
" rea inspite more ways than one
. rea
, the accomplished irish actor most notable from his star turn in jordan
' s
" the crying game
,
" contri
butes a restrained
and managed performance as da brady
, a small town drunk in an unnamed irish community in the 1960s
.
but it
' s his wall
- to
- wall narration as the
butcher boy of the title
, da brady
' s son
, francis
, that makes rea
' s
" peformance
" worth watching
, worth listening to
. annd that
' s only half the funn
. playing the young francie brady is newcomer eamonn owens
and he is
, without a doubt
, a revelation
. for as much as rea
' s voiceover permeates allmost every scene of
" the
butcher boy
,
" owens comm
ands virtually every frame
. it
' s impossible to take your eyes off him
. with his crop ofthe carrot
- colored hair
, ruddy complexion
,
and overall grubby appearance
, francie brady is an unlikely hero
, refusing to be done in by his alcoholic
, trumpet
- playing father
, his depressive
, suicidal mother
, or the neighboring
, bespectacled monster known as mrs
. nugent
( fiona shaw
)
. iin fact
, everything was ok until
" the nugent
" came to town
. now
, she poses as much a threat to the safety annd security of town bully francie
and his best pal joe
( alan boyle
) as the looming commie menace
(
" the
butcher boy
" is set at a time when the fear of nuclear obliteration is first
and foremost in the minds of many
)
.
" pigs
!
" screams mrs
. nugent at the brady menagerie
.
" you
' re all pigs
!
" it
' s the start of many a related image
. after ma brady is shiped off to teh
" garage
" for psychiatric observation
and da brady downs oen bottle of whiskey too many
, francie finally loses grip of his fantasy world ofthe cowboys
and indians
, the lone ranger
,
and other comicbook characters
. squealing like a sticked pig
, francie does
" the likes o
' that
" on the nugent
' s living room floor
,
and is hismelf whisked away to a very catholic rem
and home for
" boney arsed bogmen
,
" where his ever fertile imagination
-
-
and clever chicanery
-
- runneth over
. director jordan
' s vivid treatment of pat mccabe
' s nightmare novel produces a sometimes disturbing
, dark comedy littered with surreal touches
( such as sin
? ad o
' connor playing the virgin mary
)
. it
' s not as outl
andish as the trailers amking outloud
; instead
, this remarkable film focuses on the effects external influences have on the friendship vetween two boys
( schoolboy chums in real life
)
, allowing us to empathize with their plight in the presense of extraordinary behavior
. it
' s bleak
and it
' s black
but it
' s fundamentally very funny
. rea talks us thru it
, beautifully
, annd owens drags us
though it
, admirably
,
and
, in t
andem with jordan
' s sure h
and
, theirs are contri
butions to make
" tje
butcher boy
" a film worth savoring
.
