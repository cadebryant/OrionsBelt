as iwth his other stateside releases
, jackie chan ' s latest chopsocky vehicle
, mr
. nice guy
, is contrived
, blockheaded
,
and lacking in narrative logic
.
but also like thsoe other films
, it is a highly enjoyable ride
. once again
, chan ' s screenwriters
( here edward tang
and fibe ma
) have taken thte easy way out
and named their star ' s character simpley jackie
, with no last name
. this jackie is a world
- class chef who co
- hosts a popular cooking show on australian television
. of course
, jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist
,
and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter ' s
( gabrielle fitzpatrick
) expose of a drug dealing ring
. other plot details
, involving a videotape
and a biker gang
, are irrevelant
; in fact
, as is the case with most chan films
, thge plot itself is just about irrevelant
. the sole purpose of mr
. nice guy ' s existence are chan ' s comic fight scenes
,
and those here do nto disapait
. director samo hung
( who has a cameo role
)
, a longtime collaborator of chan ' s
, does not waste any time putting chan in action
, diving head
- on into a wild chase
/ fight
/ shootout after a brief cooking show prologue
. other impressive setted pieces follow
, most notably a chase in a mall
, which directly leads tothe some frenzied
, if cliched
( can you sday fruit cart
?
)
, business involving a runaway carriage
;
and an extended late
- film sequence at a construction site
, in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards
, cement mixers
,
and a deadly buzzsaw
. none of the action sequences in mr
. nice guy are as spectacular as supercop ' s thrilling helicopter
- train finale or rumble in the bronx ' s daring leap between two buildings
; nor is anytying as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike
and operation condor
, respectively
.
but the action delivers
, even if the energy peters out before the film ' s end
( the finale
, as spectauclar as it is
, is a letdown for fans of chan ' s athletic prowess
)
. filmed almost entirely in english
( even so
, the voices of some english
- speaking actors are laughably dubbed
)
, mr
. nice guy hints at jackie chan ' s latest transition to hollywood productions
( he made ill
- fated attempts with 1980 ' s the big brawl
and 1985 ' s the protector
)
; enxt in the pipeline is rush hour
, a stateside production co
- starring chris tucker
. hopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown
,
and chan will continue wiht exuberant hong kong productions such as mr
. nice guy
, for his unique charm
annd reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands
, much like they have beeen before
.
