and easy review
: i really enjoyed matinee
. the mixture of comedy
and tension blended nicely
. unlike many comedies this film tries
,
and succeeds
, in getting past the stage ofthe doing anything for a laugh
. the makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story
. thte performances of all yhe principals are right on the mark
, particularly john goodman as the schlock master
. so i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted
,
yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours
. longer
, omre detailed review
:
[ beware of spoilers
] the primary reason i enjoyed this film was
, that while being a comedy
, the film also had an intelligent story to tell
. too many comedies today subscribe to the yhe notion that a comedy need only make you laugh
. you watch the movei
, laugh a lot
, leave the theatre
and take nothing with you
. matinee is not like that
. i left the picture thikning about whta i would do faced with hte cuban missile crisis
. i foudn myself wondering what would happen to the characters of yhe film
.
but most importantly
, i found myself caring about what would happen tothe the characters
. the comedy of the film centers arund goodman
, his character
,
and the film he brings to key west
. i believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today
. he isnt highly expressive both physically
and vocally
. i felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his owrk in barton fink
. the other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his comm
anding nature
,
however
, while the star
, goodman is actually not at the center of the film
. the movie is realy teh story of tjhe four teenagers
, discovering who tehy are
and what they want
, agianst a background where at any minute it could all end
. i
thought the kids reaction weere highly realistic
. htey tried tothe block it out
, they tryed to escape from yhe concerns of their world
. unfortunately it kept creeping back in
, particularly with the fear
,
and tghe chaos of the time
. while thte comedy centered on goodman
,
and the drama on hte teens
, there was a great deal of overlap
. several aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light
. one example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans
and boxes of food in a grocery store
. if ytou think baout it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly tothe be the backdrop for a comedy
,
but it works here
. anyother reason i like this film is that i like b
- science fiction movies
. one of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 from outer space
.
( note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies
,
but oen of my favorite to see
.
) while mant
! never got made
, many films like it were
,
and mant
! serves mostly as dante
' s homage to hte b
- films he loves
. so again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good
, humorous story
. this isn
' t a gag film like many other comedies bu an intelligent
, well
-
thought out
, film about real people with real problems told infront an often hilarious way
. enjoy
