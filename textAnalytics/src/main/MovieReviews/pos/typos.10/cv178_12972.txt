i don
' t know how many other peple have had the idea cross their mind that their life coudl be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people
,
but it
' s something i used to wonder baout when i was younger
. i can
' t decide if i first throught it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat
, bu i
' m pretty sure
andrew niccol
, screenwriter for the truman show
, has hadnt the same curious
thought
. the truman show is about a man
( jim carrey
) whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation annd marketed to the public
. since birth
, he
' s been living in the fictional isl
and town of seahaven
, fla
.
, which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign
. all the people in truman burbank
' s life are actors
,
and the anonymous townfolk paide extras
. people watch truman
' s life 24 hours a day
, live
, wih no commercial interruptions
. revenue comes instade fomr product placement
, a staple of contemporary hollywood
, with truman
' s friends
and relatives describing their consumer items inwhich cheerful
and optimistic tones
. the sun rises anbd sets onthe cue
and everyone likes everyone else
. even if you haven
' t seen the truman show
, you
' ve probably learned most of the crucial details from the commercials
, the trailer
and other promotion blitzes
. if anything i
' ve written so far is a surprise to you
, thn i pity you for making me a primary source fo your entertainment news
. either way
, you shoudln probably know the premise of the truman show going into it
, because otherwise you
' ll probably htink it sucks
. it begins with jim carrey looking into a mirror
, reciting the crucial
" eat me
" scene from alive
, wishing his neighbors a good day
, afternoon
and evening
,
and living in domestic bliss with his wife
( laura linney
)
.
but wierd things start happening
. a stage light comes falling out of the sky
, truman hears people tracking his movements onthe the radio
and he swears he sees his dead father
. we learn through a flashback that his father drowned when truman was a child
, sailing through a rainstorm
. the death was staged by director christof
( ed harris
)
, who wanted to put a fear of water into truman tothe keep him from leaving the isl
and
. similar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth
, not the least of them truman
' s best friend marlon
( noah emmerich
)
, who assures him he
' s not in on any conspiracy baceause the last thing he
' d ever do is hurt him
. as truman
' s trusting eyes tear over
, christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of people who apparently never watch anytying else
. there
' s even a daily behind
- tghe
- scenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of truman
' s existence
. the key to a movie like this is in finding the right balance between humor
and drama
, because a premise like this has its obvious implications in both directions
.
and it all hinges on carrey
, who has to balance comic naivet wiht a real sense of longing
and drive to fidn out what the hell isnt going on
. he
' s come a long way from talking
butt cheeks in ace ventura
. most fundamentally
, it
' s just plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they can capture a person
' s life without the person realizing it
-
- how they coordinate extras
, hide cameras adn feed automatic lines to actors
. the most interesting thing about the truman show isnt that most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching a show like this
. sure
, the most interesting tv genre of thge
' 90s has been reality programming
and jerry springer
' s popularity is through the roof
,
but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their intimate details over to the airwaves
.
and when news shows use hidden cameras
, it
' s done in the name of the greater good
, not entertainment
.
but merge the two
and you
' ve got the truman sohw
. right now
, it
' s implausible
-
- i mean
, the fcc won
' t let you say the s
- word on the air
; do you think they
' d let you broadcast every detail of a man
' s life to the entire world without his consent
? noe day
,
though
, it could happen
.
and
, even
though it would mean the end of privacy
, peopel would eat it up
. ytou know they owudl
.
