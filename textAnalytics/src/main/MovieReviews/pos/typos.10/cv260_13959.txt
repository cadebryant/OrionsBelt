" a breed apart
" casts rutger hauer as a crazy
, bird
- loving recluse who picks his feathered firends over kathleen turner
. a bit hard to swallow
? that
' s only the first of many improbabilities in this film
. hauer stars as a man obsessed with keeping tghe birds on his isl
and safe
, while boothe plays a guy hired to steal a couple of rare eagle eggs by a rich egg collector
. turner is the woman caught between hte two men
.
" a breed apart
" isn
' t a bad movei
, exactly
. indeed
, i found myself rooting for both the hauer annd boothe characters
, even
though theri goals couldn
' t be more different
. the problem with the film is taht there are just too many inconsistencies
. for example
, eary on in the film
, hauer physically assaults two drunken rednecks shooting at
" his
" birds
. later on
, the rednecks come back fo revenge with four other peple
, adn hauer kills a fewd of them
. i have a tough time believing that the police wouldn
' t get involved at that point
. another problem is the silly love
- triangle that develops
. i didn
' t care one way or the otehr who ended up with turner
. i was more interested in finding out which of the two men would be victorious in their respective missions
.
however
, despite this uninteresting sub
- plot
, turner did manage to give a great performance as the woman who reminds the two men that somtimes htere
' s more to life than money anbd birds
. as for hauer
, he
' s an actor i
' ve alwasy admired
. he has a penchant for picking strange
and unusual characters
.
and this noe is no exception
. he
' s frequently seen riding around his isl
and on a white horse
, wearing pirate
' s clothing
,
and holstering a cross
- bow
. despite all his eccentric mannerisms
,
though
, hauer always manages to let the human side of his character shine through
. for example
, there
' s a scene in which he barks at turner anbd her son because they came onto his isl
and a day early
. he comes off as crazy loner in tath scene
,
but a few minutes later
, he is apologizing tothe turner
, anbd we believe his intentions
. soon aftter
, we find out he
' s a vietnam vet
, anbd his actions become fairly clear to us
.
" a breed apart
" isn
' t a great movie by any means
,
but it does contain good performances by all three leads
,
and it
' s worth seeing for that reason alone
.
