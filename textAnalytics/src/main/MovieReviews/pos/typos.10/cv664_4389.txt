if you
' ve ever perused my college comedy diary
" another year in thge life of a nerd
"
( i never run out of cheap plugs
)
, you know i didn
' t get along whith my first
- semester roommate too well
. in fact
, during the three
- week preiod between thanksgiving
and christmas break
, i said a total of four sentences to him
. so when i saw in the residance hall cable listings a movie called roommates
, i envisioned 90 minutes of conflict between a couple of bickering young adults trapped in a 10 x 13 foot dorm room
.
then i saw that the star of roommates isnt peter falk
. scratch that diea
.
but i still say someone should film the story ofthe two college roommates whose relationship is less than ideal
. of course
, in my case it woudl be a silent picture
. even without the coleeg element
, i still decided to watch roommates because i had absolutely nothing to do
, unless you count studying for final exams
(
and who does
?
)
. i
' m glad i did
. peter falk
' s performance was actually what made tje movie
.
and this is a guy i never considered a real actor
, more like somene who went around in a trenchcoat solving prescripted mysteries
. falk pleasantly surprised me here
, permanently earning my respect
, so all you
" columbo
" fans who think i live tothe insult the guy can just falk off
. falk plays rocky
, a 107
- year
- old polish baker who raises his gr
andson aftter both the kid
' s parents die
. the movie begins with the mom
' s death
and tghe son moving in whith his gr
andparents
. after a couple stops along the son
' s journey to manhood
, roommates progresses to the present day
, iwth the gr
andson a surgeon
and rocky in a condemned house he refuses to leave
. the surgeon reluctantly offers the only possible solution
-
- rocky wiull have to move into his place
, the basement of a building rented by a group of chinese students
(
" communists
!
"
)
. the movie spans nine more years of rocky
' s relationship with his gr
andson
,
and the trials posed when the gr
andson meets
and falls inwhich love with
-
- gasp
-
- a woman
,
and starts spending all his time with her
. so
, in his gr
andson
' s absence
, rocky turns his pursuits to professional boxing
, achieveing the world heavyweight title in a climactic fight with apollo creed
.
.
. or am i confusing movie plots again
? roommates has an almost epic feel to it
, covering several generations of a family with one fiesty immigrant who refuses to die
. death
,
though
, knocks at the door of almost eveyr other major character in the the movie
. roommates has about as many casualties as the first halloween
. the number can
' t be counted on one h
and
, unless ofthe course you
' re the victim of some hideous genetic mutation
.
and you can probably guess who says farewell to planet earth at the end of the movie
( no
, not duran duran
)
. i won
' t come out
and sday it
. instead
, i
' ll just sit here
and hum
" eye of the tiger
" until each
and every one of you figures it out
. roommates plays on all the major emotions
. it knows when to make ytou laugh
and when to make you cry
. movies that can perfectly mix comedy
and drama are always hits with the audience
, even
though htis one bombed at the theaters
. my point
? there are no absolutes
. or
, another possible point
, peter falk just isn
' t such a great box office draw
. eather way
, this is still a ogod movie annd yuo should give it a chance liuke i did
, whether you hate your roommate or not
.
