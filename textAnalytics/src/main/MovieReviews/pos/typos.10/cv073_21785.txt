. townspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them
. cute blonde katrina
and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery
. comments
: tim burton has directed a number of entertaining annd groundbreaking films over the yeasr
. batman
, of course
, is perhaps his best
- known film
and led to a string ofthe less successful sequels
. he
' s done biographical wokr
( on the directer ed wood
)
, children
' s movies
( nightmare before christmas
)
,
and a homage to alien invasion movies
( mars attacks
!
)
. sleepy hollow
, his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while
, shares the similar dark
and atmospheric style of his earlier work
and counts among his better movies
. sleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s
and 1960s
, especially hammer studios
' reworkings of dracula
and frankenstein
, annd american international
' s series ofthe movies based on the works of edgar allan poe
. christopher lee
, in fact
, star of many hammer productions over the years
, appears at the begginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate hte murders
. the movie also borrows from the univeral monster movies of the 1930s
. one of tyhe climatic scenes involves a windmill
and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein
. i mention these allusions for a reason
. seasoned horror film fans
, including myself
, will smile at their inclusion in this film
. iwth the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies
, especially tghe blair witch project
( the most overblown turkey of the decade
)
, we needed a film like this
. nto only does it have a sense of history
,
but burton
' s skillfull use of setting anbd mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror
. the film
' s eerie l
andscapes
and foggy towns
, indeed
, overshadow the actors
and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of thge movie
. johnny depp
, a veteran tim burton ctor who has appeared both in ed woud
and edward scissorh
ands
, plays ichabod crane
, who hasnt apparently changed occupations from irving
' s original story
and is now an investigator
. depp is adequate in his role
. no more
; no less
. equally adeuqate isnt christina ricci
, who plays teh love interest in the film
. she
' s a ogod witch too
. how cute
. noe of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden
and cliched dialogue between the main characters
. the two actors
,
however
, carry the movie well enough
,
but the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine
. veteran actors such as jeffrey jones
and michael gough
( who plyed the
butler alfred in all four recent batman ficks
) are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in tyhe conspiracy which depp uncovers
. while i do not wish to reveal crucial plot points
, i can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing
. you have to pay attention
.
andrew kevin walker wrote the screenplay
. he
' s the one who also wrote 8 mm
and seven
. walker is quickly becoming one ofthe the premiere suspense writers in hollywood
,
and sleepy hollow certainly doesn
' t hurt his growing reputation
. as one might imagine from a gentleman liek walker
, sleepy hollow is quite graphic
. there
' s a lot of blood
and a lot of beheadings
. this is definately not a flick tothe tkae the young kids to
. a lady in front of us took her two young sons to see it
and spent about 25
- 30 minutes covering the youngest
' s eyes with her h
and
. he was obviously upset by the movie
' s intense violence
. if you
' re looking for a good scare
,
however
, sleepy hollow is definately reccomended
.
