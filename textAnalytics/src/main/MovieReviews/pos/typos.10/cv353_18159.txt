with thte abundance of trite
, recycled movies in the late
' 90s
, there is a tremendous dem
and by movie lovers
( never mind movie criticists
) for movies that present the wide film audience with something truly original
: perhaps audaciously
, perhaps purely thematically
. forthe the fromer
, you need look no further than director tom tykwer
' s incredible german thriller run lola run
, a movie that may make some viewers need a cooling off period afterwards
. lola
, a contemporary goth
- girl with blazing red hair receives a desperate phone call from her boyfriend manni one day
. it seems that because she was late delivering something he lost a bag containing a hundred thous
and markes
,
and if he doesn
' t deliver a hundred thous
and marks within the next twenty minutes
, he wiull be killed
. this gives lola twenty minutes to come up with 100
, 000 marks
, or her boyfriend dies
. so she runs
-
- not just jogs
, sprints
-
- in hopes that somehow
, someway
, she
' ll be able to obtain the money
and save a life
.
> from there
, as critic steve rhodes described it
, run lola run plays a bit like
" sliding doors on steroids
. with a non
- stop techno soundtrack
, wierd camerawork
, all kinds of insane zooms
and a truly breakneck pace
, anyone that is bored with run lola run has to be smoking something
. indeed
, tje movie is often outrageously exciting
, as well as bitterly ironic
and subtly serious
. very much like titanic
, run lola run is an achievement with filmmaking much more than it is an achievement in film
. the way the movie is made
, for pure visual style
, tykwer
' s movie is breathtaking
( literally
, somtimes
)
. thematically it does leave something to be desired
; it toys around with some intriguing ideas
but does occasionally seem as if there is littel substance behind all ofthe the flash
. while you are watching
, this will not marter
. running a breezy 81 minutes
, this is oney movei i wished was longer because it was so damn good while it lasted
. it is the equivalent of a roller
- coaster in the amount of thrills
and fun that it offers
