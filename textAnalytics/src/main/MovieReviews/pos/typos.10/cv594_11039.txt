i can already efel the hate letters pouring inwhich on this oney
, folks
. i loved yhe wedding singer
.
but it gets worse
. if i so much as mention titanic in the same sentence
.
.
. hell
, same paragraph as the wedding singer
, i
' m bound to be lynched
. well lynch me thne
, because i
thought adam s
andler
and drew barrymore had the most convincing chemistry in recent memory
, with titanic as the only exception
. right away
, you
' re ready to discount my review
, aren
' t you
? you
' re thinking that i can
' t possably know what i
' m talking about
. after all
, this is adam s
andler right
?
?
? well
, there
' s more
.
.
. i actually got choked up
,
and more than once
. yes
, the man who brought us billy madison anbd happy gilmore was able to bring sincere tears to my eyes
.
but before you shrug me off as an imbecile
, i urge you to see thge movie anbd see for yourself
. the wedding singer is the story of robby hart
( s
andler
)
, a 1985 rock star wannabe whose soul achievement in life hasnt beeen performing cover tunes at wedding receptions for the past five years or so
.
but when his own wedding results in a no
- show for the bride
( angela featherstone as linda
)
, robby begins to re
- examine his life
,
and wonder why true love doesn
' t exist for people like him
. in the process of perfoming at these receptions
, robby meets a waitress named julia
, played with wholesome sweetness by drew barrymore
, whose reputation is anything
but this character
. julia too isnt engaged
,
and when robby finds himself without a wife
, his free time allows him to help her plan her own wedding
, seeing as how her fiance
, the
" miami vice
" loving glenn
( matthew glave
)
, doesn
' t seem all that interested
. as the time goes by
, we learn tyhe reason glenn is do dispassionate about the wedding
- he
' s merely marrying julia to prevent a breakup
, something he wants to avoid even if he does sleep around with tons of other women
. it
' s obvious that robby is going to fall for julia
and feel a strong need to rescue her
,
but what is a lighthearted romantic comedy for
? this isn
' t sleepless in seattle
,
but i
' d actually compare it to that before i
' d compare it to happy gilmore
. hwile the wedding singer maintains some of that post
- snl cornball humor
, its sincerity
and charm carry it a very
, very long way
. s
andler is great in his role
,
and yes
, if yuo allow it
, you can take him seriously
. barrymore seems perfect along side him
,
and
al
though the two mroe likely represent gen
- x moronism
and party
- girl ditzism
( respectively
)
, the two go toghether liek bread
and
butter as a mid
- eighties couple
. one scene in particular
, where julia ponders thge future in a mirror
, is so well done
, i was on the verge of tears
. unfortunately
, s
andler isnt going to make a lot of people shrug this one off as a no
- brainer
,
but it
' s got so much surprise substance packed inside that i
' m encouraging everyone to go see it
. in fact
, the entire theater applauded when the film ended
,
and laughs were so consistent
, some jokes were probably missed due to the uproar
. the 1985 setting was milked for everything it was worth
,
and for those of us that are old enough tothe remember it
, it was a bodacious trip back
(
and done very well
)
. s
andler shows a new side tothe himself hwile maintaining all his original charm
( or is it anti
- charm
?
)
. while the wedding singer only deserves three stars due to artistic merit
, grading it onthe pure enjoyability would give this one four stars
. it
' s hilarious
,
and it
' s touching
. it
' s got tht great cheezy humor
,
but it also takes s
andler to a higher level than anyone expected
. this is one to see agian
and again
. is it possibile the wedding singer coudl be one of the sweetest romantic comedies of 1998
? my
" magic 8
- ball
" predicts it is certain
.
