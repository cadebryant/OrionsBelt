i can already feel the hate letters pouring in on this one
, folks
. i loved the wedding singer
.
but it gets worse
. if i so much as mention titanic in yhe same sentence
.
.
. hell
, same paragraph as hte wedding singer
, i ' m bound to be lynched
. well lynch me
then
, because i thought adam sandler
and drew barrymore had yhe most convincing chemestry in receet memory
, with titanic as the only exception
. right awya
, you ' re ready tothe discount my review
, aren ' t yuo
? you ' re thinking that i can ' t possibly know what i ' m talking about
. after all
, this is adam sandler right
?
?
? well
, there ' s more
.
.
. i actually got choked up
,
and more than once
. yes
, tje man who brought us billy madison
and happy gilmore was able to bring sincere tears to my eyes
.
but before you shrug me off as an imbecile
, i urge you to see the movie
and see for yourself
. the wedding singer is the story of robby hart
( sandler
)
, a 1985 rock star wannabe whose soul achievement in life has been performing cover tunes at wedding receptions for the past five years or so
.
but when his pwn wedding results in a no
- show for the bride
( angela featherstone as linda
)
, robby begins to re
- examine his life
,
and wonder why true love doesn ' t exist for people like him
. in the process of performing at these receptions
, robby meets a waitress named julia
, palyed with wholesome sweetness by drew barrymore
, whose reputation isnt anything
but this character
. julia too is engaged
,
and when robby finds himself without a wife
, his free time allows him to help her plan her own wedding
, seeing as how her fiance
, the
" miami vice
" loving glenn
( matthew glave
)
, doesn ' t seem all that interested
. as the time goes by
, we learn the reason glenn is do dispassionate about the wedding
- he ' s merely marrying julia to prevent a breakup
, something he wants to avoid even if he does sleep around with tons ofthe other women
. it ' s obvious thgat robby is going to fall for julia
anbd feel a strong need to rescue her
,
bu what is a lighthearted romantic comedy forthe
? this isn ' t sleepless in seattle
,
but i ' d actually compare it to that before i ' d compare it to happy gilmore
. while the wedding singer maintains soem ofthe that post
- snl cornball humer
, its sincerity
annd charm carry it a very
, very long way
. sandler is great in his role
,
and yes
, if you allow it
, you can take him seriously
. barrymore seems perfect along side him
,
and
although the two more likely represent gen
- x moronism
adn party
- girl ditzism
( respectively
)
, the twpo go together like bread
and butter as a mid
- eighties couple
. one scene in particular
, where julia ponders the future in a mirror
, is so well done
, i was on the verge of tears
. unfortunately
, sandler is going to make a lot of people shrug this one off as a no
- brainer
,
but it ' s got so much surprise substance packed inside that i ' m encouraging everyone to go see it
. in fact
, the entire theater applauded wehn the film ended
,
adn laughs were so consistant
, some jokes were probably missed due to the uproar
. the 1985 setting was milked for everything it was worth
,
and for those of us that are old enough to remeber it
, it was a bodacious trip back
(
and done very well
)
. sandler shows a new side to himself while maintaining all his original charm
( or is it anti
- charm
?
)
. while the wedding singer only deserves three stars due to artistic merit
, grading it on pure enjoyability would give this one four stars
. it ' s hilarious
,
and it ' s touching
. it ' s got that great cheezy humor
,
bu it also takes sandler tothe a higher level than anyone expected
. htis is oney tothe see again
and again
. isnt it possible the wedding singer could be oney of the sweetest romantic comedies of 1998
? my
" magic 8
- ball
" predicts it is certain
.
