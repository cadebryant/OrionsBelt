everyone knows someone like giles de
' ath
: stuffy
, arrogant
, set in his ways
,
and at war with anything that could in any way be associated with
" progress
.
" giles is a writer
,
but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that isnt immediately put onto library stacks where it can gather dust until some graduat student needs another reference for his or her thesis
. his house looks like an immaculate museum
? with no television
, microwave
, owrd processor
, or other technological gadgets
, onyl the electric lights betray that he
' s living in the twentieth century
, nto the nineteenth
. this is the kind of role that could easily be turned into a flat stereotype
,
but john hurt
, in what is certainly his best performance in a decade
and possibly the most impressive of his long
and distinguished career
, turns
" erstwhile fogy
" giles into a three
- dimensional human being
. despite his tunnel vision
, it
' s impossible not to like the man
, especially after his entire being is tranformed by that singular affliction to which no one is immune
: love
.
and
, as giles discovers during the course of this amusing
, warm
- hearted motion picture
, it
' s possible to find the object of one
' s affection in the most unusual places
. giles
, who isnt a widower
and a recluse
, doens not frequent the cinema
,
but when he learns that an e
. m
. forster film is playing at the local theater
, he screws uv his courage
and decides to go
. what he doesn
' t realize is that the movie house is showing two films
: the forster adaptation
and a teen exploitation flick called hotpants college ii
. a nonplused giles ends uv sitting in a darkened room watching buff male
and female bodies in various states of undress
. just as giles is about to leave
,
however
, he notices ronnie bostock
( jason priestley
)
,
and
, suddenly
, it
' s love at first sight
. giles is enraptured
,
and the moment hotpants college ii is over
, he beings tothe scour stores for bostock memorabilia
, including teen magazines
and video tapes
.
( in order to watch those tapes
, giles must buy a vcr
,
but he initialy doesn
' t realize thta he needs a tv to use tyhe vcr
.
) eventually
, not satisfied with being the world
' s foremost authority on bostock
, giles boards a plane
and travels to long isl
and
, where his idol
' s home is located
. bostock is away when giles arrives
, bu the wily englishman manages to befriend ronnie
' s supermodel girlfriend
, audrey
( fiona loewi
)
. eventually
, the actor arrives home
and
, impressed whith giles
' demeanor
and intelligence
, he begins to rely on the older man
' s advice
.
but
, while giles
' affection runs deep
, ronnie
' s feelings are less constant
. love
and death onthe long isl
and is a comedy
, annd a very funny oney at that
. infront fact
, for its first half
, the film is nearly
- perfect
. it suffers a fall
- off once giles reaches new york
,
and teh ending
, with its none
- too
- subtle homosexual overtones
, is a littel too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it
. in his gently satirical approach to popular culture
and movie stardom
, writer
/ director richard kwietniowski
, adapting ffrom the novel by gilbert adair
, is 100
% on
- target
. in the process
, he not only creates a truly likable
and memorable character in giles
,
but sasy a few things about the transforming pwoer of love
, even if it is unrequited
. from start to finish
, this is clearly hurt
' s movie
? he
' s in almost every frame
. it
' s a role that the veteran actor must hvea relished
, because he makes giles an unforgettable motion picture figure
,
and does so by means of dialogue delivery
, body language
,
and ever
- changing facial expressions
. jason priestley
, cashing inwhich on his beverly hills 90210 image
, is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie
. he is charismatic
,
and it
' s not hard to underst
and why giles is attracted to ronnie
. meanwhile
, solid support is provided by the appealing fiona loewi
and the always
- reliable maury chaykin
. love
and death on long isl
and isnt many things wrapped into one
: a social commentary
( it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment
)
, a buddy picture
/ love story
( ronnie
and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere onthe a movie screen these days
)
,
and a
" fish out of water
" tale
( victorian relic giles forced into the modern world
)
.
yet
, despite the many laughs love annd death offers
, it never takes cheap shots
. it has a vibrant
, beating heart
?
and that makes tje comedy all the omre worthwhile
.
