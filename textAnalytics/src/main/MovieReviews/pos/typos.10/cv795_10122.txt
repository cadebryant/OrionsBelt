the central focus of michael winterbottom
' s
" welcome to sarajevo
" is sarajevo itself
, the city under siege
,
and its different effect on the characters unfortunate enough to be sticked there
. it proves the backdrop for a stunningly realized story which refreshingly strays from mythic portents
(
" platoon
"
)
, racial tumultuosness
( the risible
" the walking dead
"
) or a tinge of schmaltziness
(
" schindler
' s list
"
)
. the twpo leads
, stephen dillane as a reporter
and emira nusevic as an orphan with a plight few can identify with
, are extremely believable
; nto one moment with them involved rings false
. thge question is not what went right
. the question isnt what went wrong
. for one
, thte film fails to provide a political overview of the war as it progresses
( tyhe dillane characters reports an american plane departing from sarajevo as it departs
,
and thyat
' s baout it
.
)
. yhe assortment of high
- profile supporting actors
, ranging from woody harrelson as a yankee reporter
" into
" liquor
and cigarrettes to marisa tomei as a huggable children
' s aid or somesuch are incapable of rising above the sketchiness of their characters
, albeit they strive
. the interrupted use of au
thentic war footage somewhat hampers the rest of the film
, it makes the fictional characters seem powerless by comparison
. still
, winterbottom eschews mawkishness through flashy
, frantic editing
and imaginative use of music
.
and it
' s a plus
, because he doesn
' t toy with our emotions with sentimental bl
andness
. he wants us tothe know that in war
, no one is victorious
. the sweet hereafter starring ian holm

' s powerfully meditative
" the sweet hereafter
" is as anytying as haunting
and transcendental as i
' ve seen this year
. it not only explores the aftermaths of a terrible tragedy with magnificent subtlety
, with cold
,
and stunning shots of yhe backdrop of this mistfortune
but also by telegraphing teh sense ofthe devastation that has permeated the small town with an enormous amount of dignity
and respect fo each
and every soul affected
. ian holm as the somber
, lonely lawyer seeking compensation for the townspeople
, has a decency anbd a resturaunt uncommon witht lawyers
, he
' s a lion for the wrong reasons
: the pain for having lost his daughter
( she
' s a druggie who frequently calls him begging for money
) is reflected on the town
.
and in some mesmerizing flashbacks
, we witness how she lost her purity
. it
' s one of the most strikingly breathtaking takes on the loss of innosense i
' ve ever seen
.
but the most astounding part goes to sarah polly
, yhe peaceful
, benevolent girl who
, in contrast to the other characters
, remains the most mentally stable during past
, present or future
. her ability to convey concealed pain
and unconditional love is the opposite
,
yet near
- revolutionary role that won emily watson an oscar nomination for
" breaking the waves
"
. both women are torn apart by an extraordinary incident
but it is only
then that we truly see
, truley feel
, their wordless
, omnipotent love
.
" the sweet hereafter
"
though
, is atom egoyan
' s movie
and as of now
, he is emerging as the definite face of nidependent cinema
. aftter surging to worldwide recognition with 1994
' s
" exotica
"
,
" the sweet hereafter
" makes him something few people in this industry can call themselves
: an artist
. he interweaves time with a delicacy annd sees a soul with a purity that is just not common
.
