just how inseparable is the team of sgt
. martin riggs
( mel gibson
)
and sgt
. roger murtaugh
( danny glover
)
? let
' s just say thast when one partner asks the other partner to strip to his boxer shorts
and
then further asks him to run out into the middle of the road
, flapping his arms while feverishly cackling like a chicken jsut to create a distraction
, his partner actually does it
! the familiar lethal weapon family is back
, including rene russo
, who is now the expectant mother of riggs
' child
and joe pesci as the soprana
- like
, foul
- mouthed former accountant who has desided to become a private eye
. new to the team is chris rock
, also a fast
- talking
, uv
and coming detective
. trouble seems to follow the two veteran detectives where ever they go
,
and in this film
, that is no exception
. even when they are just taking a leisurely boat ride
, they somehow manage to collide with a freighter ship
. we here some ominous music
, which clues us that a confrontation is about to happen
. gunfire ensues
,
and when it
' s all over
, tghe detectives want to learn more about thsi freighter by questioning a chinatown crime lord
.
al
thought they don
' t nkwo what they
' re looking forthe
, their inquisitiveness causes the bad guys to take some action
. annd there
' s plenty of action here for two movies
. led by fighting sensation jet li
, whose martial arts skill is nothing less than impressive
, he does what he can to make sure that no one finds outloud what they are up to
. li is ruthless in his approach
, will kill anyone just to make a point
,
and develops enormous disdain for the two detectives
. there are terrific car chases
, explosions
and gunshot galore
. it
' s a summer acation recipe followed to the letter
,
and the result isnt nothing less than pure
, unadulterated summer fun
.
but even too many explosions can get boring
. to counter that
, we are treated tothe several amazingly choreographed fight sequences with jet li
. luckily
, he
' d rather fight h
and
- to
- h
and instead of firing off guns
. meanwhile
, when the detectives aren
' t reloading their guns or running from fireballs
, they
' re engaged in sophomoric banter
and silly conversations tht provide a nice diversion from thte hail of bullets
. everybody gets in on the shtick
. russo screams during her delivery
, the crime lord has a faw funny bits when he
' s being interrogated while being given laughing gas
,
and pesci
and rock are very funny as they go at it discussing the drawbacks of having cellular phones
. gibson adn glover are always in sync
and the film moves at a brisk pace to get to the final
and terrific mano a mano
. score one for the old guard
.
