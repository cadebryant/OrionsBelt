trekkies
, roger nygard
' s energetic
and hillarious documentary
, brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions
. the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies
and non
- fans aplikay
.
( the film generally writes off the trekkies vs
. trekker polemic as not worth arguing about
.
) the good
- spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable
, loud giggles
, yot the picture treats its subject matter with respect
and a certain awe
. denise crosby
, who played tasha yar on
" star trek
: the next generation
,
" serves as the host
. in the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary
( oed
)
.
( the oed cites a february
, 1976 caption in the
" new yorker
" as the frist recorded usage of the owrd
.
) unless you
' ve been tothe the conventions
, i posit that ytou have no idea of the dedication of some of the fans
. one pointed out
, apologetically
, that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly inaccurate
. others talked about how many star trek conventions they hadnt attended
, several dozen bieng typical
and hundreds not unheard of
. my personal favorite fan is sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams
. arguably the most famous ofthe all thte trekkies
, she wears her uniform every waking hour as many die
- hard fans do
. her claim to fame is that
, as a juror on the whitewater trial
, she wore it in court as well
.
" every day i would walk past the reporters with a vulcan
- like stoicism
,
" she syas
, describing her way ofthe dealing with the crowd ofthe reporters who became obsessed with her obsession
. she doesn
' t quite underst
and all of the uproar
.
" i
' m an officer ofthe the federation 24 hours a day
,
" she reminds us
. her fealty to her hobby approaches that of a religious faith
. along iwth the laugher the show evokes
, there is an equal measure ofthe sincere appreciation for people with such loyalty
.
and their infectious joy provokes a certain envy of their enjoyment
. few other avocations could give this much satisfaction
. these people are having the time of their lives
.
( for the record
, i
' m not a star trek fan
al
though i have seen some of the movies
.
) the film interviews the various star trak series
' s stars as well as its fans
. the stars had
thought the convention idea was a lark adn would soon fade
,
but over twenty years later
, the conventions are still going strong
. filled with anecdotes
, the show talks about the happenings at the various conventions
. at one
, the actor who plays q was so sick that he
thought he would have to cancel
. after appearing briefly
, he drank soem water adn left
. they desided to auction off his half
- empty glass
, joking that it had the
" q virus
.
" the guy who won the bidding immidately drank the water
and screamed to the crowd that he now had the q virus too
. with dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity
. not jsut flitting among people
, the documentary takes the time to let you get to know the trekkies
. one guy is a trekkie cross
- dresser
, another dresses her cat
, anbd
then there is the dentist
. the dentist has his entire office made up tothe look like a star trek set
. he
, his oral hygienists
, his receptionist
, his wife
,
and his kids wear the outfits all of the time
. it appears that his workers are permitted to take them off when they go home
,
but not his family
. for variety
, he
and his family do change characters ffrom time to time
. he says his patients like it
. well
, there was this one complainer
,
but he had a problem with his bill anyway
. there are summer schools fo klingon with ph
. d
. linguists to teach the language
. hamlet is now availaible in klingon
, albeit perhaps not at your local bookstore
,
and htey are working on translating the bible
. they even sell untied federation passports that are real enough that trekkies have used them to fool customs
, even u
. s
. customs
. the movie bogs down only briefly when it tries to argue the series
' s larger meaning baout diversity
and humanitarian concerns
. s
andwiched in
- between the levity
, the switch in tone doesn
' t work
. the incessantly up
- beat film ends with a singing elvis impersonator
. he fits right in
. trekkies runs a breezy 1
: 26
. it is not rated
but would be pg for brief sexual references
and would be fine for all ages
.
