note
: some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers
. be forewarned
. durig the three years since the release ofthe the groundbreaking success pulp fiction
, the cinematic outputted from its creator
, quentin tarantino
, hasnt been surprisingly low
. oh
, he
' s beeen busy
-
- doing the talk show circuit
, taking small roles in various films
, overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn
, making cameo appearances on television shows
, providing a vignette for the ill
- fated anthology four rooms
-
- everything
, it seems
, exept direct another feature
- length film
. it
' s been the long intermission between projects as well as tje dizzying peak whitch pulp fiction reched which hasnt made mr
. tarantino
' s new feature film
, jackie brown
, oen of the most anticipated films of the yearm
,
and his thrid feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s
. things aren
' t going well forthe jackie brown
( pam grier
)
. she
' s 44 years old
, sticked at a dead
- end job
(
"
$ 16
, 000 a year
, plus retirement benefits that aren
' t worth a damn
"
) as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america
-
- adn she
' s just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette
( portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton
)
and polical officer mark dargus
( michael bowen
) smuggling
$ 50 000 from mexico for gun
- runner ordell robbie
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry
( robert forster
)
. the loquacious ordell
, based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny
, bong
- hitting surfer girl melanie
( bridget fonda
)
and agreeable crony louis gara
( robert de niro
) hang out
, operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat
,
and he
' s soon out to silence jackie brown
. meanwhile
, thte authorities
' target isnt ordell
,
and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a half
- million dollars
. only through a serieses of clever twists
, turns
, adn doublely
- crosses will jackie be able to gain the upper h
and on both of her nemeses
.
al
though jackie brown marks mr
. tarantino
' s first produced screenplay adaptation
( based on the elmore leonard novel
" rum punch
"
)
, there
' s no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film
. while he
' s adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense
, the setting has been relocated to los angeles
and the lead character
' s now black
. in terms of ambiance
, the film harkens back to the 1970s
, from thge wall
- to
- wall funk adn soul music drowning tjhe soundtrack to the nondescript look of tyhe sets
-
- even the opening title credit sequence has the echo ofthe vintage 1970s productions
. the opening sequence featuring ms
. grier wordlessly striding through the lax
, funky music blaring away on the speakers
, is emblematic of films of that era
. the timeframe for the film is in fact 1995
,
but the athmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro
. of course
, nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier
and robert forster as the two leads
,
and
al
though the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists
, backstabbing
,
and deceptions deliciously unfold
, the strength of jackie brown is the quiet
, understated relationship developed between jackie
and max
; when they kiss
, it
' s perhaps tjhe most tender scene of the year
. tenderness
? in a quentin tarantino film
? sure
, ther
' ve been moments of sweetness in his prior films
-
- the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis
and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction
and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth
and am
anda plummer
, or even in reservoir dogs
, where a deep
, unspoken bond develops bewteen the harvey keitel annd tim roth characters
-
-
but for the most part
, mr
. tarantino
' s films are typified by manic energy
, unexpected outbursts of violence
,
and clever
, often wordy
, banter
. these staples of his work are all present in jackie brown
,
but what
' s new here is a different facet of his storytelling
-
- a willingness to imbue the film iwth a poignant emotional undercurrent
,
and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation
. tihs effective demostration of range prohibits thte pigeonholing ofthe mr
. tarantino as simply a helmer ofthe slick
, hip crime dramas with fast
- talking lowlifes
,
and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent
; he
' s the real deal
. tihs new aspect of mr
. tarantino
' s storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character
-
- taht of thge world
- weary
, sensitive
,
and exceedingly
- professional max cherry
, whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching
. mr
. forster
' s nuanced
, understated performance is the best in the film
; he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie
, we smile along with him
. much press has been given baout the casting of blaxploitation
- era icon pam grier in the lead
, with the wags buzzing that mr
. tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travolta
' s thne
- sagging career
. as it turns out
, ms
. grier is solid in the film
' s title role
,
al
though nothing here forces her to test her range
. i dont have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection
,
though
-
- she
' s been working steadily over the years
, often in direct
- to
- video action flicks
,
but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burton
' s mars attacks
!
and larry cohen
' s original gangstas
( where she first teamed uv with mr
. forster
.
) of course
, it
' s true that her role here was a godsend
-
- a meaty a part as this is rarity for
* any
* actress
, let alone one ofthe her age
and current status in the industry
. while jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone
, it marks tremendous growth of mr
. tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly exp
anding
,
and whose characterizations have never been better
.
and while the film
' s narrative doesn
' t really warrant a runing time ofthe 155 minutes
, it
' s filled with such sumptuous richs
, ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining
, inconsequential conversations between the characters
, that there wasn
' t an unengaging moent
. with an impressive trio ofthe feature films under his belt
, it
' ll be interesting tothe see what he tries next
.
