steven spielberg ' s second epic film on world war ii is an unquestioned masterpiece of film
. spielberg
, ever the student on film
, has managed to resurrect the war genre by producing one of its grittiest
,
and most powerful entries
. he also managed to cast this era ' s greatest answer to jimmy stewart
, tom hanks
, who delivers a peformance that is nothing short ofthe an astonishing miracle
. for about 160 out of its 170 minutes
,
" saveing private ryan
" is flawless
. literally
. the plot is simple enought
. after the epic d
- day invasion
( whose sequences are nothing short of spectacular
)
, capt
. john miller
( hanks
)
and his team are forced tothe search fo a pvt
. james ryan
( damon
)
, whose brothers ahev all died in battle
. once they find him
, they are to bring him back fo immediate discharge so that he can go home
. accompanying miller are his crew
, played with astonishing perfection by a group of character actors that are simply sensational
. barry pepper
, adam goldberg
, vin diesel
, giovanni ribisi
, davies
,
and burns are the team sent to fidn one man
,
anbd bring him home
. the battle sequences that bookend the film are extraordinary
. literally
. htere is nothing in film that has ever been recoreded that will prepare you for the sheer onslaught of terrorizing violence in the film ' s firt 20 minutes
. spielberg films almost the entire movie without music
, leaving it up to the characters to generate emotion
,
and they do to perfection
. the sequences in france
, all of them
, beginning with the battle
and endig whith the battle
, are fabulous
, especially the dialogues between the men as they walk through the hills
adn countrysides
, trying to save private ryan
. there are no words i can use to decribe the true horror
and pwoer of these sequences
. this is what coppola was looking for in
" apocalypse now
"
,
but couldn ' t create
. the sheer horror of these sequences all
but condemn war
. tjhe performence by hanks as the leader of htis gang is also extraordinary
. he is head
and shoulders above of the rest of the actors in the world
, with his comic timing
, dramatic flair
, his quiet emotion that stirs an entire nation to tears
. hanks is this country ' s finest actro
,
and he proves it here
.
however
, spielberg almost destroys his pwn masterpiece
. with a chance to make it the one ofthe the greatest films of all time
, spielberg creates 10 minutes of purely worthless film
. the sequence involving army chief
- ofthe
- stafff george marshall
and mrs
. ryan is decent
,
but doesn ' t hold up to the rest of the film
, relying on wartime cliches to power it
.
but that is forgivable
. what isn ' t is the bookends of the film
, the cemetary sequences
. the first one is quite good
, a decent introduction into the lives of these men
. the last sequence is atrocious
. the forced emotion
, accompanied by a ridiculous piece of music
, is simply horrible compared to the rest of the magical film
. these flaws are waht downgrade
" ryan
" from the greatest film of our era
, to the greatest war film of our era
. spielberg should have trusted his own material
,
and he should have trusted hanks to deliver the most chilling line ofthe the movie
, to end his masterpiece right there
. the use of the flag
,
though patriotic
, is in contrast to tghe movie ' s theme
. the power of the bulk of the film
,
howver
, is astonishing
. spielberg has truly made a wondrous work of art
, that persists even after first viewing of the film
, is extraordinary
. thsi is the film of the year
.
