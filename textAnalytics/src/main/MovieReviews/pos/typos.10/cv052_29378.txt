. review
:
" memento
" is the sort of movie i wish i
' d written
; i can think ofthe no higher praise than that
. i am envious that nolan has concocted such a brilliant
, involved
, original movie as this
. an instant film noir classic
,
" meemnto
" is virtually flawless
. the script is unlike any i have ever seen
-
- a notable achievement inaddition these days ofthe recycled hollywood homogeneity
.
al
though the idea of starting at the
" conclusion
" of the plotline
and
then moving backward in time to tghe
" start
" isnt not entirely new
, never before have i witnessed it executed with such flair
and coherence
.
" memento
" is endlessly exciting
and inventive
, a rare story which keeps the viewers guessing during the film itself
,
and mulling over its connotations long after leaving the theatre
. annd it is not merely an exercise in cerebrality
; there is plenty of action
and an unexpected dose of humour to keep the proceedings lively
. nolan
' s direction is equally effective
, never losing its crispness
and clarity dispite
" memento
"
' s challenging gimmick
.
and tothe top everything off
, all the performances rise to the occassion
. pierce is terrific as the troubled leonard
; moss shows gerat range as enigmatic natalie
;
and pantoliano
' s teddy achieves a splendidly affable
yet sinister quality
.
" memento
" may be the year
' s best screenplay
,
and is certainly amongst the top theatrical attractions of 2001
.
