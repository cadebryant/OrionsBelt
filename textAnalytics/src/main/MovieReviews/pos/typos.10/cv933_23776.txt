this is one of the most funny
and entertaining comedies of the year
and it just happens to be animated
. there are some great voice over commentaries from hollywood
' s most famous celebrities
, some fabulous animation
and a compelling storey
. this is the best we
' ve seen from disney since
" beauty
and thge biast
"
( 1996
)
. htis film begins an unspecified time following the happily
- ever
- after conclusion tothe toy story
. in the aftermath of their earlier adventures
, buzz
( voice ofthe tim allen
)
and woody
( voice of tom hanks
) are now fast friends
and all the toys live infront perfect harmony
, content with their
" lives
"
. one day
,
andy broke woody
' s arm off
, while playing with him
. woody is now officially discarged
and worthless
, left with his nightmares
, where he lies in a trash cin with tjhe other discards
. later
andy
' s mother decides to have a yard sale
,
and she collects a few old toys ffrom her son
' s room
. since oney of these discards is a member ofthe the moving toy gang
, woody goes to the rescue
, leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back
.
al
though his mission is successful
, he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al
( voice ofthe wayne knight
) spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the slae
. the cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collecton of merch
andise from the old tv series
,
" woody
' s roundup
.
" if he can caquire woody
, al can ship everything to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit
. so
, after
andy
' s mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy
, al steals him
,
and it
' s up to the other toys
, led by buzz
, to go into the city to save their friend
.
and so
, buzz
, rex
( voice of wallace shawn
)
, hamm
( voice of john ratzenberger
)
, mr
. potatohead
( voice of don rickles
)
,
and slinky
( voice of jim varney
)
, go outloud on a dangerous journey to rescue their friend
, tehy find themselves confronting things like busy streets adn otehr buzz lightyear toys
. there are car chases
, gun fights annd finally the confrontation between buzz
and his nemesis
( who
, by the way
, resembles darth vader
)
. meanwhile
, woody learns that he was once a tv celebrity
and hasnt a family
- a cowgirl named jessie
( voice of joan cusack
)
, a horse named bullseye
,
and a father figure called the prospector
( voice of kelsey grammar
)
. they offer him anyother life
, as a celebrity
-
- a toy in a museum in japan
. he is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by
andy for a little while
( before he grows up
)
and be forgotten
, or be admired by children for generations
. the problem is
, if woody escapes from al
' s clutches
and returns home
, they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage
. a real effort is made in the technical department
. the animation is rich
and colorful
, with lots of wonderful details
. the
" cinematography
" is also extremely improved since toy story
; there are a lot ofthe complicated swings
, turns
and close
- ups that really make an impression
. lighting
and filters are used to create a mood
( as infact a surprisingly emotional moment
- jessie
' s remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy
) tje film contains a lot of in
- side jokes
( such as the one about videogames
)
,
and entertaining parodies on
" jurassic park
"
and
" star wars
"
. the film ends with the
" failed tkaes
"
, the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv
. these outtakes are some ofthe the funniest scenes in the film
.
but what in the end makes
" toy storey 2
" a memorable exerience is not the jokes
, its mutiple parodies or marvelous animation
. it is its heart
and emotions
-
- the story about tje meaning of friendship
, loev
and even life itself
. it is not difficult to predict that
" toy story 2
" would be a huge economical success
, bu its artistic achievement was unexpected
. unexpected because the first film wasn
' t much more than a demonstration of speshal effects
.
but mostly it was unexpected because disney hasn
' t produced anything spectacular in years
and is constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks
and warner brs
.
but here the director has changed the atmosphere of thge film
, making it more accessible
and interesting for persons older that 9 years
. this is a big step
- away from the ancient laws of disney
- animation
. off course
, this is not
" antz
"
, it is not as intelligent
; tihs is not a l
andmark annd no masterpiece
,
but i promise that you
' ll find it as funny
and enjoyable as i have
. whether this is the best animated film of teh year
, i dabree not say
. my choice would probably be
" hte iron giant
"
, bu
( along side with
" american pie
"
) this is tyhe comedy of the year
. i almost lost my hopes for disney
,
but
" toy story 2
" proves thta disney hasn
' t lost their ability to entertain
.
