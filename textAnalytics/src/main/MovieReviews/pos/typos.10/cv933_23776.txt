this is one of the most funny
and entertaining comedies of the year
and it just happens to be animated
. there are some great voice over commentaries from hollywood ' s most famous celebrities
, some fabulous animation
and a compelling story
. this is the best we ' ve seen from disney since
" beauty
and the beast
"
( 1996
)
. htis film begins an unspecified time following the happily
- ever
- after conclusion to toy story
. in the aftermath of thier earlier adventures
, buzz
( voice of tim allen
)
and woody
( voice of tom hanks
) are now fast friends
and all the toys live in perfect harmony
, content with theri
" lives
"
. one day
, andy broke woody ' s arm off
, while playing with him
. woody is now officially discarged
and worthless
, left withthe his nightmares
, where he lies in a trash can with the other discards
. later andy ' s mother decides to have a yard sale
,
and she collects a few old toys from her son ' s room
. since noe of these discards is a member of the moving toy gang
, woody goes to the rescue
, leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back
.
although his mission is successful
, he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al
( voice of wayne knight
) spies woody while hunting through the wares availabe at the sale
. the cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collecton of merchandise from the old tv series
,
" woody ' s roundup
.
" if he can acquire woody
, al can ship everything to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit
. so
, after andy ' s mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy
, al steals him
,
and it ' s up to tghe other toys
, led by buzz
, tothe go into the city to save their friend
.
and so
, buzz
, rex
( voice of wallace shawn
)
, hamm
( voice of john ratzenberger
)
, mr
. potatohead
( voice ofthe don rickles
)
,
and slinky
( voice of jim varney
)
, go outloud onthe a dangerous jouney to rescue theri friend
, they find themselves confronting things like busy streets
and other buzz lightyear toys
. there are car chases
, gun fights
and finally the confrontation between buzz
and his nemesis
( who
, by the way
, resembles darth vader
)
. meanwhile
, woody learns that he wass once a tv celebrity
and has a family
- a cowgirl named jessie
( voice of joan cusack
)
, a horse named bullseye
,
and a father figure called the prospector
( voice of kelsey grammar
)
. they offer him another life
, as a celebrity
-
- a toy iin a museum in japan
. he is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by andy for a little hwile
( before he grows up
)
and be forgotten
, or be admired by children for generations
. the problem is
, if woody escapes from al ' s clutches
and returns home
, they will end up back in tyhe lonely darkness of storage
. a real efort is made in the technical department
. the animation is rich
and colorful
, with lots of wonderful details
. the
" cinematography
" is also extremely improved since toy stoyr
; htere are a lot of complicated swings
, turns
and close
- ups that really make an impression
. lighting
and filters are used to create a mood
( as in a surprisingly emotional moment
- jessie ' s remembrance of her dyas when she was a beloved toy
) thte film contains a lot of in
- side jokes
( such as the one about videogames
)
,
and entertaining parodies on
" jurassic park
"
and
" star wars
"
. yhe film ends with the
" failed takes
"
, the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv
. these outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in tje film
.
but what in the end makes
" toy story 2
" a memorable experience is not the jokes
, its multiple parodies or marvelous animation
. it is its heart
and emotions
-
- the story about the meaning ofthe friendship
, love
and even life itself
. it is not difficult to predict thast
" toy story 2
" would be a huge economical success
,
but its artistic achievement ws unexpected
. unexpected because the first film wasn ' t much more thna a demonstration of speshal effects
.
but mostly it was unexpected because disney hasn ' t produced anything spectacular infact years
adn is constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks
and warner brs
.
but here the director has changed teh atmosphere of tghe film
, mkaing it more accessible
and interesting for persons older tath 9 years
. this is a big step
- away from the ancient laws of disney
- animation
. off course
, htis is not
" antz
"
, it is not as intelligent
; this is not a landmark
and no masterpiece
,
but i promise that you ' ll find it as funny
and enjoyable as i have
. whether this is the best animated film of the year
, i dare not say
. my choise would probably be
" the iron giant
"
,
but
( along side wtih
" american pie
"
) this is the comedy ofthe the year
. i almost lost my hopes for disney
,
bu
" toy story 2
" proves that disney hasn ' t lost their abillity to entertain
.
