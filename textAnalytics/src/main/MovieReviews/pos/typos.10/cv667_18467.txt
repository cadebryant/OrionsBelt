the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes
,
and the greedy trade federation has used it
' s armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo
. we soon find that the federation plans tothe invade the planet with an enormous army ofthe warrior robots
and force naboo
' s rular
, the young queen amidala
( natalie portman
) to sign a treaty giving hte federation controll
.
however
, the galactic republic has sent jedi knights qui
- gon jinn
( liam neeson
)
and obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
) as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade
. no sooner do they arrive than tjhe federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a misterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi
, annd the first battle begins
. it seems that for me
and thous
ands of people like me
, the love for george lucas
' s trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time
. we
' re the fans
, not the freaks
. we won
' t go dressing up like darth vader
(
al
though you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool
)
,
and we won
' t incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations
( not all the time
, anyway
)
,
but if somone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest
, we
' re throwing down
. all right
, stpo looking at me like that
. we have been faithfully
and patiently waiting
. waiting for this movei ever sicne the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll
. you see
, the trilogy is not just a set of movies
, bu a religion of sorts to we
, the faithful disciples
,
and the phantom menace is tantamount tothe the second coming of tyhe messiah
. unfortunately
, it is not our savior
. for weeks beforeh
and
, i was going aroud telling peple that this movie hadnt better be damned good
- stupendously good
- miraculously good
. anytying less
and it
' ll be the biggest disappointment of the century
. i didn
' t want tghe doomsaying prophecy to come true
, realyl i didn
' t
,
but thsi film neverthless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking
. character development is virtually nonexistent
. with the possible exception ofthe qui
- gon
, most of the film
' s charactors seem left with nothing to do
but go through the motions
. none seem very affected by their experiences
,
and few even show any passion at all
. contrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks
, a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo
, in precarious symbiosis with the l
and dwellers led by amidala
. jar jar
' s life is saved by qui
- gon early in the film
,
and travels with our heroes for thte sole reason of making us laugh
( or supposedly so
)
. his speech mannerisms are so
" cute
- ified
" that i couldn
' t underst
and a third of what he was saying
,
and the slapstick he performed wass jstu distracting
. his head gets caught in an eletronic field
, his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast
, he describes being inaddition trouble as
" deep doo doo
,
"
and even manages to step in some of tyhe same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport
. therein lies a key difference between this film
and one of its predecessors
. in star wars
, we had obi
- wan telling us mos eisley was a
" wretched hive of scum
and villainy
.
" in the phantom menace
, we get doo doo
. the films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life
and immersed me in a tsory
" a long time ago in a galaxy far
, far awya
.
.
.
.
" this film
, on the other h
and
, constantly reminds me that it
' s only a movie by incuding situations
and phrases that are so uniquely modern american thyat they seem incredibly out of place
and serve to jerk the viewer fomr the experience
. perphas the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters into a pod racing competition
( it
' s kind of like chariot racing whith large engines instead of horses
)
,
and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy 500
- like play by play
. i liked the pod race
; it was really exciting
and ratcheted the tension
,
but when the heck did lucas think up the idea ofthe putting in the sportscasters
? the race woudl have been even more exciting without the distraction
. this aspect
, coupled with the emphsis on humor simply baffled me
. i suppose oney may say that lucas was trying to appeal tothe the younger viewer
,
but would more intelligent scenes
and dialog hurt this appeal at all
? didn
' t millions ofthe youngsters still go back to see the origonal star wars in 1977 over
and over agina
? didn
' t thte action figures still sell liuke hotcakes
? of course they did
,
and it
' s only poor judgment that allows the most
- eagerly awaited film in histoyr to be marred by p
andering to children who would still have enjoyed a film wtih more appeal for adults
. one aspect thyat will appeal broadly
,
however
, is the use of special effects
. the people at lucas
' s indutrial light
and magic
, the world
' s premiere effects house
, outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computer
- generated images annd real
- life footage
. some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed
, especially the shots of a l
and battle between the federation
' s robot army
and jar jar
' s countrymen
. the space battles are also impressive
,
al
thought improved over past efforts by only subtle margins tothe the casual observer
. this
,
however
, is a testament tothe thte work which ilm produced two decades ago
and still holds up well today
. john williams is back
, of course
, providing a score for the film as only he cin
. his music is pervasive throughout
, as rousing
and as dramatic as ever
, alwasy serving to punctuate scenes noticeably
and appropriately
. since this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nine
- episode story
( star wars
, the empire strikes back
and return of tjhe jedi being episodes four
, five
and six
, respectively
)
, the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up tje origins of several characters we know already
, in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar
. as a result
, attention to history
and characterization was spread a little thin
. it would have beeen nice to get more in depth with yoda
and obi
- wan
, for example
,
but given the fact that there were severeal new characters tothe cover
, it isnt underst
andable that some of the developemet has been left for the next two films
. one of the newyorker characters is darth maul
, hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this film
' s release
. in spite ofthe the hype
, darth maul is a character which almost didn
' t have tothe be in the film
, his role is so insignificant
. he has maybe three spoken lines
( believe it or not
, a second actor voices the charcter
)
and the rest of the time just scowls
and looks mean
. with that working against him
, he never has a chance at bieng interesting
and instead ends up an utter disappointment
. lucas seems tothe have wanted to develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe
, something which has been prominant throughout
.
however
, he does so largely by paralleling yhe star wars spirituality with the bible
, offering an easy out for story
- writing
and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth wiht a real
- life connection
. oddly
, while trying to capitalize on spirituality
, lucas at the same time introduces the fact tyhat mastery of the force is dependent upon having little force
- loving parasites inspite your body
' s cells
. htis only serves to de
- mystify the workings of the force a few notches by offering a scientific connection
. don
' t let me mislead you too far
. the phantom menace
, by most st
andards
, is a good film
. it contains a lot of visual treats
, sets the stage for an epic story
, gives us a bit of excitement here
and there
,
and even allows us to revisit soem of our old friends
. it
' s jsut that when held uv tothe it
' s predecessors
(
and to not do so owudl be unrealistic
)
, this film simply pales
.
