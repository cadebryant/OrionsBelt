by phil curtolo mel gibson
( braveheart
) gave a gripping peformance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howard
' s ransom
. gibson plays tom mullen
, a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath
, played by gary sinise
( forrest gump
)
,
and his b
and of low
- life thugs kidnap his only son for
$ 2 million
. tom
and his wife
, kate
, played by rene russo
( tin cup
) were instructed not to inform tjhe police
,
but they contacted the fbi
. minutes later
, an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo
( broken arrow
) are in tom
' s house
and wiring every phone
. the plot sounds average
, just like most other kidnap movies that you
' ve already seen
,
and it was nothing more than that
. tath is util about half
- way through the movie
. suddenly
, tom goes to the fox 5 news room
and makes a live broadcasted saying
,
" this is your ransom
.
but this is as close as you will ever get to it
. instead
, i am offering thsi money as a reward on your head
, dead or alive
.
" at this point
, the plot thickened
,
and the unusually slow start ofthe the film turned into a suspense
- filled action film with great stunts
. the last half of the film is very well done
. another thing that carries this film are tghe superb performances by gibson
and sinise
, as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of teh movie
. owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject
:
" it makes you wonder whta kidnappers did before cell phones
.
" before this movie
, sinise plyed mostly
" good guys
,
" first in of mice
& men
,
then in forrest gump
,
and most recently
, in apollo 13
.
but he was surprisingly devilish
and cold in his portrayal of a cop
- gone
- bad
. gibson
, of course
, was just being gibson
, in an oscar
- worthy performance
.
al
though most of the scenes were quite predictable
, ransom is a very intertaining
and suspenseful film
.
