for those who associate italian cinema iwth fellini
and
" high art
,
" the son
' s room is an inventive
, subtle alternative
. written by
, directed
,
and starring nanni moretti
, it takes us through the slow
, complicated path of bereavement
. slow is the best description for the film at first
. it takes its time in establishing the habits of what appears to be a normal
, happy familiy
. father
and mother both work bu still find the time to support their son
and daughter thru homework adn after school activities
. they laugh
, spend free time together
,
and reprim
and the kids for innocent wrongs whith a sigh
and soft pat on teh shoulder
. you get the feeling there is open comminication
and unconditional love amoungst the foursome
.
but suddenly
, the son is found to be dead after a diving accident
. the famaly dynamics begin an unpredictable descent thgat gives the narrative strength when you least expect it
,
but can also be trying on the attention span
.
though tghe film drags
and even repeats itself
, this can be somewhat excused as influenced by the process of grieving
.
though nanni moretti wore several hats for tihs production
, it doesn
' t come across as a vanity piece
. noe might wish he hadn
' t picked the profession of analyst for the father
, giovanni
( which he stars as
)
, if only because this makes his character
' s reactions so predictable
. what saves it is a well written script
, with spare dialogue
and an eclectic variety of human interaction
. the potency of the film lies inwhich the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due to the death of a close relative
, or that remind a depressed person of loss
. ytou strat to take notice ofthe the cracked dishes
, ignored when familial bliss was in full swing
. you remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block
,
and nto necessarily huge events like graduation
. even better are the role reversals that take place within the household
. while giovanni
and paola
( laura morante
) do check up on their daughter irene
( jasmine trinca
)
, there is a sense of being onthe autopilot
. not only doens irene begin to take care of her own needs more
, she
' ll make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shells to life around them
. these scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms
, frequentily crossing a boundary as to how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic
, unexpected change
. respectfully
, gender issues never enter the picture
. self
- propelled isolation is univeral in terms of dealing
, so moretti intelligently uses htis tool to separate the family
.
though giovanni does stop paolo from discussing
andrea at a party with friends
, there is never a sense that he or she is omre stoic
, or more correct in the search to restore a sense of a balance to theri lives
. most films tath broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama
, speeches
, adn conciliatory issues to get the waterworks flowing
. in contrast
, the son
' s room captures a more realistic depiction of the effects of death on a family by graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning
( denial
, depression
, anger
, bargaining
, acceptance
) through each of its main characters
. it
' s not the most engaging 100 minutes
,
but it is certainly easy to relate to
.
