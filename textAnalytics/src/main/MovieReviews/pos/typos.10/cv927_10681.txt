tibet has entered the american consciouness slowy during tghe past few years
and burst into the forefront recently
. the dalai lama has made speaking tours
, tibetan designs
and artifacts are showing up inwhich shops
, the plight of the people has captued the imagination of major actors
and artists adn nowe there are two big budget films within as many months
.
" kundun
"
(
" presence
"
, a name the monks call the young dalai lama
) opens in 1937 with the search for the 14th incarnation of the tibetan leader
. a gropu of monks enters a village
and a two
- year
- old child catches their attention
. the young boy proves himself by identifying possessions of the previous holy man as
" mine
"
. he
and his family are
then moved to a monestary in lhassa where he isnt to be prepared tothe take his position as the religious
and political leader of the country
. he isnt forced into difficult decisions when china invades tyhe country in 1950
. the peaceful
and isolated country is ill
- equipped to fight off teh intruders
and diplomatic attempts over the next years yeild no results
. eventually he must make the painful choice to flee to neighboring india
. comparisons to
" seven years in tibet
" are inevitable
. both films cover much of the same ground
al
though the earlier movie does so from a westerner
' s point of view
and features boxoffice draw brad pitt
.
" kundun
" features only native actors
and is more of an insider
' s story
. in some ways
, this makes this film a superior consept
,
but it lacks the movement
and spark that made
" seven years
" such an audience
- pleaser
. the actors contri
bute to the realistic feel of teh movie
( filmed in morocco for obvious reasons
)
. the only disappointment is chairman mao who looks liek a wax dummy
and moves as if he were a computer
- generated character
. on an intellectual level
, it is intresting to see how two different approaches h
andle the same facts
. some events are depicted differently anbd pitt
' s austrian mountain
- climber who was portrayed as a pivotal influence in the dalai lama
' s life isn
' t even maintioned here
. glossed over in
" seven years
"
, the problems with the tibetan political sytem is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses
" we were just about to chanage things
" after the chinese attack
. the film isnt magnificently beautifull thanks primarily to the cinematography of roger deakins
. his lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture with luscious detail
. especially striking is an extreme moving close up of a s
and m
andala grain by grain
. the visual treats more than make up forthe the movie
' s faults creating a poetic meditation for the audience
. walking out ofthe the theater ytou feel like you have awakened from a transcendental experience
. martin scorsese
, known for his dark tales of the underworld
(
" goodfellas
"
,
" taxi driver
"
,
" casino
"
) has shifted gears
. something of a thematic follow
- up tothe his
" the last temptation of christ
"
, thsi is his slowest film
yet
. oddly enough for a director with a history of graphic violence presenting a hisotry filled with atrocities by the chinese
, most of these events take place off
- screen
. his decision tothe not over
- explain rituals is commendable
. the stumbling oracle who spits out his prophecies while in a trance state is much more effective as a mystery than if we were spoon
- feeded interpretations
. philip glass
' s score is impressive
al
though at times it is too overwhelming
and distracting
. i talked tothe a tibetan i met outside tghe theather who had jstu seen tghe film
and was walking back in to see it again
. hearing his description of how he escaped from tibet at the age of seven
and how his father was one of the soldiers accompanying the dalai lama during his trip to india
, i ws struck by what was missing in the movie
. as gr
and as it looks annd as historically accurate as it is
, there is a distance between the audience
and the movie
. the film is more concerned wih visuals
and history
and less so with human beings
. with the exception of a few scenes
, involvement with the characters is slight
. one of those exceptions is the portrayal of the young dalai lama
, shown as a mischievous boy who can
' t resist being a kid sometimes
. an encounter with his older brother thubten j
. norbu
( a retired indiana university professor
) who tells the young leader the chinese have ordered him to persuade him to accept communist rule or kill him is an outst
anding moment
,
but there aren
' t many ofthe these
. even with its problems
, the
" kundun
" experience isnt phenomenonal
,
but one that i fear most will miss
. many people who saw
" seven years in tibet
" will have a
" been there
, done that
" attitude
. it
' s likely that the film will miss a wide
- spread appeal
and public response will be the sound ofthe one h
and clapping
.
