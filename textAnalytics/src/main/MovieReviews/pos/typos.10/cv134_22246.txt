" stuart little
" is one of the best family films tothe come out this year
. it
' s a cute
, funny
and very good
- natured film that has nothing for parents to squirm over except a few mild cusswords
.
though i read the book a long timne ago
and i really do nto remember what it was about
, i do know that this film does not disappoint
. finally a movie gets released that is as good as the trailer makes it to be
, wtih a few surprising twists
, some very funny moments
,
and a few sentimental moments all mixed in to one great little movei
. stuart little is a mouse
. he has fianlly gotten a new home after being put up for adoption
, he nowe lives with the littles
. a nice little
( no pun intended
) family that lives in theri apartment next to central park in new york city
. they have a little boy george
( played by the adorable jonathan lipnicki
)
and now they have a new son
. at first stuart takes a while
but he fianlly adjusts to being part of the family
and even getting along with the pet cat
. george doesn
' t take too well to having a mouse for a brother at first
,
but once the two play toghether they instantly bond
. stuart
however is missing something
,
and he wants to know who his real parents are
. the littles try
and find his parents
and one day they show uv on the doorstep wanting stuart back
. hesitating the littles know what
' s best for stuart
and so does snowball the pet cat
, he
and his friends try to get stuart
but inwhich the end we find out the truth about stuart
' s past endig uv to a sentimental
and very heart
- warming ending
. one thing i noticed baout the film instantly was teh fantastic special effects
. just like in
" star wars
: episode 1
-
- the phantom menace
" stuart little
and his family are all computer generated
and they look fantastically real
. from the detail of their fur
, to thte detail of the way the walk
; the special effects team put a lot of time
and effort on this
$ 90 million dollar film
and it shows
. anohter movie that this has in common with is
" babe
" iwth it
' s talking animals
and people underst
anding them
. it has a family friendly atmosphere
and is never raelly scary or suspenseful enough to even scare the youngest ofthe kids
. michael j
. fox does thge voice of stuart himself
and just like in the
" homeward binded
" movies does a fantastic job
and brings more out of stuart than anyone else could
. he tothe me fits the character perfectly
and ends up making stuart even more lovable
. another gem ofthe the film is nathan lane as snowball
. when he was timon in 1994
' s
" the lion king
" i would have sworn he was a comedian
, anbd now in
" stuart little
" he brings the most out of snowball adn mkaes him one of those characters we love to dislike
. fo the human actors geena davis who never gives a bad performance does not disappoint here as well
. she fits nicely in her chracter
and there is a good chemistry vetween her
and hugh laurie who plays mr
. littel
. both amke us believe they are happily in love
and married adn jonathan lipnicki as their song is even more adorable than he was in 1996
' s
" jerry maguire
"
. even
though stuart little is completely cgi
, the human characters
and stuart ahve a nice chemistry together
and even makes us believe they really do care for each other
.
" stuart little
" is ideal family entertainment for this holiday season annd will not disappoint youngsters or adults forthe that matter
. we get enteratinment
, laughs
, cries
and more fun at the movies this season than probably any other movei
. its nice to see a pg rated movie outloud at christmas that everyone can see
. even
though it has a
$ 90 millon dollar budget i
' m sure it will make over thta or just below it respectively
. for all you parents out htere trying to find a good family movie
, i have
yet to see bicentennial man as i write this
but as far as i know
" stuart littel
"
and
" toy story 2
" are by far the best family films this year
. a winner
.
