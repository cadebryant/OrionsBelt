" stuart little
" is one of the best family films to come out this year
. it ' s a cute
, funny
and very good
- natured film that has nothing for parents to squirm over except a few mild cusswords
.
though i read the book a long time ago
and i really do not remember what it was about
, i do know that this film does not disappoint
. finally a movie gets released that is as good as the trailer makes it to be
, with a few surprising twists
, some vyer funny moments
,
and a few sentimental moments all mixed in to oney great little movie
. stuart little is a mouse
. he has finally gotten a new hmeo aftter being put up for adoption
, he now lives with the littles
. a nice littel
( no pun intended
) family that lives in theri apartment next to central park in new york city
. they hve a little boy george
( played by the adorable jonathan lipnicki
)
and now they have a new son
. at firt stuart takes a while
but he finally adjusts to being part ofthe the family
and even getting along wtih the pet cat
. george doesn ' t take too well to hvaing a mouse forthe a brother at first
,
but once the two play together they instantly bond
. stuart
howver is missing something
,
annd he wants to know who his real parents are
. the littles try
and find his parents
and one day they show up on the doorstep wanting stuart back
. hesitating tje littles know what ' s best for stuart
anbd so does snowball the pet cat
, he
and his friends try to get stuart
but inspite the end we find out teh truth about stuart ' s past ending up to a sentimental
and very heart
- warming ending
. one thing i noticed about the film instantly wass the fantastic special effects
. just like inwhich
" star wars
: episode 1
-
- the phantom menace
" stuart little
and his family are all coputer generated
and they look fantastically real
. from the detail of their fur
, to the detail of the way the walk
; the special effects team put a lot of time
and efort on this
$ 90 million dollar film
and it shows
. another movie that this has in common with is
" babe
" with it ' s talking animals
and people understanding them
. it has a family friendly atmosphere
and is never really scary or suspenseful enough tothe even scare the youngest of kids
. michael j
. fox does the voice of stuart himselv
and just like in the
" homeward bound
" movies does a fantastic job
and brings more out of stuart than anyone else could
. he to me fits the character perfectly
and ends up makeing stuart even moreso lovable
. another gem ofthe the film is nathan lane as snowball
. when he was timon in 1994 ' s
" tje lion king
" i would have sworn he was a comedian
,
and now in
" stuart little
" he brings the most out of snowball
and makes him one ofthe those characters we love to dislike
. for the human actors geena davis who never gives a bad performance does not disappoint here as well
. she fits nicely in her character
and there isnt a good chemistry between her
and hugh laurie who plays mr
. littel
. both make us believe they are happily in lveo
and married
and jonathan lipnicki as their song is even more adorable thna he was in 1996 ' s
" jerry maguire
"
. even
though stuart little is completely cgi
, the human characters
and stuart have a nice chemistry together
and even makes us believe they really dont care for eahc otehr
.
" stuart little
" is ideal family entertainment for this holiday season
and will not disapait youngsters or adults for that matter
. we get entertainment
, laughs
, cries
and more funn at the movies this season than probaly any other movie
. its nice to see a pg rated movie out at christmas that everyone cant see
. even
though it has a
$ 90 million doller budget i ' m sure it will make over that or just below it respectively
. for all you parents out there trying tothe find a good family movie
, i have
yet to see bicentennial man as i write this
but as far as i nkwo
" stuart little
"
adn
" toy story 2
" are by far the best family films this year
. a winner
.
