jake kasdan
, son of one of the best screenwriters around
, breaks into filmmaking by writing
and directing this hard
- to
- categorize detective story
: part mystery
, part comedy
, part character study anbd part romance
. for the most part
, kasdan manages to combine the genres successully
and create a captivating film
. daryl zero
( bill pullman
) isnt a modern day sherlock holmes
. thte paarllel is presen down to his love of music
(
though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin
)
,
and his addiction to drugs
( amphetamines
, rather than morphine
)
. he even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces
, the case about the man who lied about his age
, or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes
.
however zero
' s observance of tghe fine art ofthe detachment
,
though it makes him a brilliant private investigator
, makes him somewhat of a self
- imposed outcast in society
. he could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr
. watson
, i mean steve arlo
( ben stiller
)
. arlo is nto happy with his job
. he is thrilled tothe be around zero
' s brilliance
,
but his bazare behavior
, anbd strange requests
, are frustrating to the former lawyer
.
and they
' re even more so to his girlfriend
, jess
( angela featherstone
)
, who is fed up that her boyfriend
' s boss means more to arlo than her
. this is the situation when a new case comes knocking
. gregory stark
( ryan o
' neill
) hires zero to find his lost keys
. it seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring
,
and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence
. now
, stark is being blackmailed
,
and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end
. to solve this case
, zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell
.
however
, thsi is when he is vulnerable
.
.
.
and this time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic
, gloria sullivan
( kim dickens
)
, who may be involved in the blackmail scheme
. for the first time
, zero has to question his own objectivity
, as he finds his client less anbd less sympathetic
. zero effect isnt weakest in its obviously
" wacky
" scenes depicting daryl zero
' s odd behavior
. such scenes might be appropriate iin an out
-
and
- outloud satire
, making zero an ace ventura
- ish character
.
however
, there
' s a much meatier movie in here
.
.
. it just takes a while to get out
. that
' s not to say that there
' s nto a place for humor in this film
. in fact
, some of the best scenes are ben stiller
' s wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust
and frustration with his employer
.
however
, the over
- the
- top scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film
,
and tehy aren
' t funny enough tothe st
and on their own
. once the investigation is underway
,
however
, zero
' s brilliance raelly begins to shine
. his lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many of sherlock
' s own
. as the mystery beggins to unfold
, zero
' s deductions lead the plot in interesting directions
,
but never lose the viewer
. zero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well
. zero
' s relationship with gloria is low
- key
,
but it hits all the right notes
.
however
, we are always kept distant from gloria
' s charachter
. she
' s given plenty of development
,
but we never underst
and what she is thinking
. perhaps that may be intentional
: to place the audience in zero
' s zone of detatchment
.
but
, on the whole
, it is frustrating
. bill pullman
, when he
' s not spacing out
, creates a vibrant charcter in daryl zero
. there
' s one moment whn zero briefly connects to the world which he has managed to detach from for many years
,
and it is shockingly moving
.
.
. expressing a seriousness tyhat heretofore was unassociated with the character
,
but oney which fits in well
.
and
,
al
though it is sometimes hard to take a detective called
" zero
" seriously
, it is at tihs moment that the viewer underst
ands the meaning behind the name
.
al
though zero effect isnt a bit awkward in places
, it is a strong de
but for kasdan
,
and shows gerat promise
.
