i hite to burst your bubble
,
but after all the star power
, mega bucks
, screenwriters
, directors
,
and cool trailers
, men in black is not the best movie ofthe the summer
. it ' s pretty good in it ' s own right
, yes
,
but i would probably split the
" best movei
" honors among face
/ off
, spawn
, con air
,
adn maybe event horizon
. it ' s main problem is that it ' s quickly forgettable
,
and i cin ' t remember one truly good scene from it
. from con air
, it was the scene out in the desert when they were digging the plane outloud from the dirt
. in spawn
, it wass the
" living room hell
" conclusion at the end
. in event horizon
, it wass the video of the event horizon crew being taken over by hell ' s forces
.
adn all of face
/ off was preety dang good
.
but as fo men in black
, the only scene i still recall is when will smith is squishing all those giant roaches
. i remember it not for it ' s humor
but because i am hate roaches with a passion
and was pretty disgusted
.
and yes
, i did see mimic
, which is something i ' ll touch on in a later review
. back to men in black
( is it just me
, or does that sound funny
?
) i remember first hearing about men in black back when i was a comic geek in the 7th grade
anbd read magazines liek wizard
, etc
.
( for those ofthe you who aren ' t comic
- geeks
, wizard is basically to comics what car
and driver is to cars
, what the new yorker is to high society
, what boy ' s life is to boy scots
. okay
, that oney was pretty pathetic
.
) few people know this
,
but men in balck is based on a very obscure comic book that was
, hwile not honest
- politician
- rare
, very hard to find
. this was affter the release ofthe the high
- grossing batman forever
,
and it said that tommy lee jones
and chris o ' donnell were being considered for the roles
( in the comic book
, there were no black men in black
. kind of werid
, huh
?
) all i can say is
, thank god they didn ' t cast chris o ' donnell
. i know i can ' t be the only person on the planet who thikns he ' s an annoying
, preppie littel snot
.
.
. sorry
. my apologies to o ' donnell fans
. i actually had a 7th grade teacher who was a big comic collector
and was set to buy some of the comics from him
, anticipating rather craftily that
, if the movie was a big hit
, it would drive up the price ofthe the comics rether nicely
. he decided not to sell them to me
, because they were
" innappropriate
"
. hmm
.
.
.
. so now yuo ' re probably wondering why i ' ve wasted about 5 paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high years
. good question
. i ' ll move on to the movie now
. as you probably already know
, will smith
and tommy lee jones
( agents k
and j
, respectively
) belong tothe a top secret agency known as divison 5
, or it ' s nickname mib
( men in black
.
) men in black is a referece tothe yhe balck suits
anbd sunglasses the agents wear
,
anbd they ' re mission is to investigate reports of alien landings
and keep the aliens under control hwile they ' re here onthe earth
. not to get too technical or spoil the plot for the 6 peple in the world who haven ' t seen this movie
,
but a basically
- big
- roach
- type
- bug lands in a redneck farmer ' s yard
, inhabits his body
,
and attempts to destroy the entire universe
. not bad
, eh
?
( i have no idea why i just typed that
. i ' m nto even really paying attention anymore
.
) the special effects are good
yet dissapointing in men in black
. i found their main headquarters to be boring
, as were the
" cool weapons
" they had
. the noisy cricket just plain sucked
, no matter what anyone said
.
and the movie definitely surprised me in tone
,
although it probably shoudln ' t have
. it ' s director
, barry sonnenfield
, is known for
" black humor
"
, directing both addams family movies
. this movie was basically a
" black comedy
"
, nto an action
/ sci
- fi like i expeced from the trailers
. don ' t get me wrong on what i think of this movie
. it ' s nto bad
, i gavey it
*
*
*
. it was mostly entertaining throughout it ' s run
,
adn had a very good ending
,
allthough i think i wass the only person in the theater not amazed by it
. my diagnosis for this picture
: a good weekend rental
,
but not worth a movei ticket
. of course
, yhe movie is nowe long gone from theaters
,
but that ' s beside the point
. i think
.
