i hate to burst your bubble
,
but after all the star power
, mega bucks
, screenwriters
, directors
,
and kool trailers
, men in black is not the best movie ofthe the summer
. it
' s pretty good in it
' s own right
, yes
,
but i would probably split the
" best movie
" honors among face
/ off
, spawn
, con air
,
and maybe event horizon
. it
' s main problem is that it
' s quickly forgettable
,
and i can
' t remember one truly ogod scene from it
. from con air
, it was the scene out inwhich the desert when they were digging the plane out from the dirt
. in spawn
, it was the
" living room hell
" conclusion at the end
. in event horizon
, it was the video of the event horizon crew being taken over by hell
' s forces
.
and all of face
/ off was pretty dang good
. bu as for men in black
, the only scene i still recall is when will smith is squishing all those giant roaches
. i remember it not for it
' s humor
but because i am hate roaches with a passion
and was pretty disgusted
.
and yes
, i did see mimic
, which is something i
' ll touch on in a later review
. back to men in black
( is it just me
, or does that sound funny
?
) i remember first hearing about men in black back when i was a comic geek in the 7th grade
and read magazines like wizard
, etc
.
( for those ofthe you who aren
' t comic
- geeks
, wizard isnt basicaly tothe comics what car
and driver is to cars
, waht the new yorker is to high society
, what boy
' s life is to boy scots
. okay
, that one was pretty pathetic
.
) few people know this
,
but men in black is based on a very obscure comic book that was
, while not honest
- politician
- rare
, very hard tothe find
. this was after the release of the high
- grossing batman forever
,
and it said that tommy lee jones
and chris o
' donnell were being considered for the roles
( in the comic book
, there were no black men inspite black
. kind of weird
, huh
?
) all i can say is
, thank god they didn
' t cast chris o
' donnell
. i know i can
' t be the only person onthe the planet who thinks he
' s an annoying
, preppie little snot
.
.
. sorry
. my apologies to o
' donnell fans
. i actually had a 7th grade teacher who was a big comic collector
and was set to buy some of the comics fomr him
, anticipating rether craftily that
, if the movie was a big hit
, it would drive up the price of the comics rather nicely
. he decided not to sell them to me
, becasue they weere
" innappropriate
"
. hmm
.
.
.
. so now you
' re probably wondering why i
' ve wasted about 5 paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high years
. good question
. i
' ll move on to the movie now
. as you probably already know
, will smith
and tommy lee jones
( agents k
and j
, respectively
) belong tothe a top secret agency known as divison 5
, or it
' s nickname mib
( men in black
.
) men in black is a reference to the black suits
and sunglasses the agents mear
,
and they
' re mission is to investigate reports of alien l
andings
and keep the aliens under control hwile they
' re here on earth
. nto to get too technical or spoil the plot fo the 6 people in the world who haven
' t seen this movie
,
but a basically
- big
- roach
- type
- bug l
ands in a redneck farmer
' s yard
, inhabits his body
,
and attempts to destroy the entire universe
. not bad
, eh
?
( i have no diea why i just typed that
. i
' m not even really paying attention anymore
.
) the special effects are good yot dissapointing in men in black
. i found their main headquarters to be boring
, as were the
" cool weapons
" they had
. the noisy cricket just plain sucked
, no matter what anyone said
.
and the movie definitely surprised me in tone
,
al
though it probably shoudln
' t have
. it
' s director
, barry sonnenfield
, is known for
" black humor
"
, directing both addams family movies
. this movei was basically a
" black comedy
"
, not an action
/ sci
- fi like i expeced from tjhe trailers
. don
' t get me wrong on what i thikn of this movie
. it
' s not bad
, i gave it
*
*
*
. it was mostly entertaining throughout it
' s run
,
and had a very good ending
,
al
though i think i was the onyl person in tje theather not amazed by it
. my diagnosis for this picture
: a good weekend rental
,
but not worth a movie ticket
. of course
, the movie is now long gone from theaters
,
but that
' s beside the point
. i think
.
