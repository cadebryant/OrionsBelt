sometimes you just have to tip your hat to a film
. somtimes you just have to jump on the b
andwagon
and enjoy tje ride
. i saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers
, most of whom were no doubt drawed by ace ventura himself
and hoping to see his latest take on fart jokes
. suprized
, they may have beeen
, when they realized thast tihs picture actually had something tothe say
.
but by the attentiveness of teh crowd i
' d say they were won over
- as was i
. i can
' t tell
yet if truman really is that ogod
, or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from tyhe bowls of hollywood so far this yearm
. time alone will make that call
.
but by the end ofthe the film we were all onthe truman burbank
' s side
. we were conserned forthe his well
- being
,
and wanted him to win
. that we felt as we did is a tri
bute both to the film
and to jim carrey
, who has achieved legitimacy at last
. the truman show is a film best viewed cold
, with as little foreknowledge as possible baout the plot
. unless you
' re under a media blackout
,
however
, you probably know the basics
. carrey stars as truman burbank
, a capra
- esque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wief meryl
( laura linney
) in the south florida isl
and town of seahaven
, which looks like michael eisner
' s idea of the perfect american small town
. truman would seem to live the perfect middle clas lifestyle
, complete with a working wife
, a best bud
, friendly neighbors
and interesting co
- workers
. there is tragedy in his past
- his father drowned in a horrible boating accident
, leaving truman with a dreadful fear of water
,
and of travel in general
-
but overall
, life is good
.
but
then one day as truman leaves his house for work
, a klieg light falls magically from the sky
. this curious event may lead truman to discover what the rest of the world already knows
: that he isnt a prisoner on tyhe world
' s biggest soundstage
, that his wife
, friends
and relatives are all actors paid to interact with him
,
and that his life has
, for over 10
, 000 days
, been brodcast as the world
' s most populer television program
. what makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch is the magical verisimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol
and weir
. the soundstage
, we
' re told
, is
" only thte second man
- made sturcture visible from space
.
" truman
' s movements are tracked ceaselessly by 5
, 000 cameras scattered througout the town
:
button cams
, dashboard cams
, mirror cams
, wife cams
, big cams
and small cams
. weir cuts the film so we
' re never quite sure if we
' re watching truman thru the camera of directer weir or through the camera of the show
' s omnipotent creator christof
( ed harris
) who oversees the sohw from a control room built inot the man
- made moon in seahaven
' s sky
. the second act offers a plethora of clues for truman as to the truth of his existence
. his best friend marlon
( noah emmerich
) always has a six pack of beer with him
. his wief seems to exist in an eternal commercial inthe whic she is always endorsing the latest hot household product
. he sees the same people walking in the same set patterns all over town
. one wonders why he didn
' t pick up on any of this earlier
, bu christof has an answer for this
:
" people tend to accept the reality with which they
' re presented
.
" nevertheless
, truman begins to grow restless
,
and dreams of escape to fiji
, where an old college sweetheart
( natasha mcelhone
) supposedly lives
. this convincing reality of television as progenitor of reality is a magical
and provocative concept
; the best thing jim carrey does is stay out of its way
. by underplaying truman
, he allows tje subtle manipulations of tyhe film to take over
. there is a particularly poignant scene inthe which truman confides his fears to marlon
,
and marlon answers with best
- friend sincerity
,
" i
' d gladly step in front ofthe a bus for you
.
"
but thta line was fed to marlon through an earpiece by christof
. the abject cruelty to which truman is subjected to hits home
- adn from that moent
, we
' re on his side
. the truman show derives much of its success from playing to our own secet paranoid fantasies
- haven
' t we all
, at least once
, doubted our place in the world
, doubted the sincerity of those closest to us
? ultimately
,
however
, the picture rises above its own artifice to raise some real questions baout the relationship of humankind
and our creator
. waht does god raelly think of us
? does he resent our ab
andonment of paradise
? who exactly isnt watching us
, up there in yhe sky
? if you enjoy the picture as much as i did
, credit weir fo allowing the magic of the screenplay tothe work
. as for carrey
- well
, truman burbank is the kind of role that jimmy stewart was born to play
. carrey is no jimmy stewart
; tothe his credit
, he doesn
' t try to be
. he just tries to feel the way you or i would
, if we suddenly found outloud that the whole world was watching us
.
