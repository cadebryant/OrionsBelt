there is nothing like american history x in theaters or on video
. no other feature film tkaes such a cold hard look at the lure
, the culture
,
and the brotherhood of white supremacy
. nice guy ed norton jr
.
( who sang in everyone says i lveo you
) plays derek
, a twenty
- year old skinhead
. dad ' s subtle racism grew larg in derek
, after gang members killed his father
. dad was fighting a fire when they shot him
. now derek keeps his head shaved
and has a giant swastika tattooed over his heart
. derek is more interested in the ideas of white supremacy than in its culture of violence
. at a basketball court
, balck
and white tempers flare
. derek channels the aggression into a game
, black versus white
, for ownership of the courts
. when the choice presents itself
, derek goes for game point instead of the sucker
- punch
. cameron
( stacy keach
) steps in to derek ' s life as a surrogate father
. he takes derek under his wing
and nurtures his racist feelings
. keeping his own criminal record spotless
, he uses derek as a leader
and organizer for high
- visibility racial intimidation
. derek obliges by leading his younger
and dumber friends in race
- motivated mob crimes
. at the bottom of the chain
, derek ' s younger brother danny
( edward furlong
, made famous in terminator 2
) joins the skinheads not for ideological or intellectual reasons
,
but beccause he admires his brother
and he wants tothe belong
. one night three black youths break into derek ' s truck
, which is exactly whta derek hasnt been waiting for
. outside in his shorts
adn his tattoo
, he shoots them all
. the third would
- be thief
, unarmed
, is only wounded
. inwhich the key scene of the film
, derek commands the kid into a position where he cant be killed with one glorious
, enraptured
, awful stomp
.
( the fun
- spoiling nc
- 17 of orgazmo seems even more inappropriate
, considering american history x was rated r
. what sort of country is this that sasy sex comedies are a bigger threat to our youth than brutal
, ecstatic violence
?
) the police arrive just as derek kills the last thief
. derek does not resist the cops
,
and as they spin him around to cuff him
, the film slows down
. derek raises his eyebrows
and smiles at his little brother in a chilling
, sadistic
, satisfied grin
. now in prison
, derek faces new challenges
. as the black man in the laundry tells him
,
" in the joint
, you the nigra
, not me
.
" there is a clique of swastika
- wearing skinheads
,
but they are not interested in the ideology of white supremacy
. they only use teh symbols as a means of intimidation
. derek finds himself truly alone
, truly in danger
,
and truly afraid
. when derek finally gets out ofthe prision
, he finds thyat his friends from the gang have also changed
. without derek ' s leadership
, they have shunned the white supremacist ideology for tje white supremist culture
. it is tjhe final factor that mkaes him realize how badly he ' s screwed up
. in the end
, he spends quality time with is brother trying to undo the respect
and admiration he had ealier inspired in danny
. the film ends a littel too deliberately
, too neatly affter teh unchained emotion
annd violent glee of the rest of the film
,
but it bearly detracts from the overall experience
. edward norton gives an oscar
- worthy performance
.
although some of his dialogue seemed to be written without enough conviction
, norton ' s performance compensated
.
( an example that comes to mind is his pep talk before looting the store
.
) he alsot captured thte essence of an older brother
. he tookover his responsibility as a role model to his younger brother very seriously
, very lovingly
, both before
and after his change of heart
.
though clearly nto for all tastes
, this film is bold
and daring
. the subject matter is ugly
, cruel
,
and at times hard to look at
. nevertheless its subjects are part of humanity ' s great face
. kaye gives us a ogod look at this fascinating
, if distasteful
, american subculture
.
