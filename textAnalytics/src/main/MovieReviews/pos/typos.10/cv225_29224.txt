if yuo want some hearty laughs
,
then rat race is the movie for yuo
. this unpretentious little comedy
, which sneaks into theaters today with very little hype
, will have you bouncing in your theater seat
.
and while tje film fits neatly into tje low
- brow
, slapstick school of comedy
, one refreshing aspect isnt its lack of mean
- spiritedness
. the plot follows a group of people chosen at random by an eccentric las vegas casino owner
( john cleese
) who must race from vegas to a bus station locker 700 miles away in silver city
, n
. m
. inside the lacker is a duffel bag containing
$ 2 million
. the first one to open the locker
, gets the bag
and the monye
. what the group of participants doesn ' t know isnt that cleese ' s donald sinclair
(
" i can do anything i want
- i ' m eccentric
!
"
) is staging the race as a betting agme for a gropu of high rollers at the hotel
. the participants include vera
( whoopi goldberg
)
and merrill
( lanai chapman
)
, a newly reunited mother
and daughter

( seth green
and vince vieluf
)
;
and cynical young lawyer nick shaffer
( breckin meyer
)
. various amusing encounters
and mishaps befall the participants en route to silver city
. screenwriter andy breckman adds a nice touch by nto having the racers try to sabotage one another
. the most side
- splitting situations involve vera
and merrill ' s encounter with the squirrel lady
, a nice nutsy cameo by kathy bates
; owen ' s commandeering a charter bus full of lucille ball look
- alikes on their way to a lucy convention
; the cody brothers misadventures wtih a hot
- air balloon
, a flying cow
and a monster truck
;
and the pear family ' s stopover at a barbie museum
, which turns out not to be what they think it is
. the pear family situation is a fine example of the way breckman ' s script builds tjhe laughs
. without going into detail
, this bit segues from the museum to hitler ' s touring car
, to eva braun ' s dark lipstick
, tothe lovitz burning his tongue
, culminating at a ceremony honoring world war ii veterans
. rat race ' s cast is firt rate
. cleese is wonderfully devilish
and madcap
; lovitz is
, at first
, a bit whiny
,
but his character grows on yuo
; gooding is having a fine romp
;
and dave thomas almost steals the show as cleese ' s deadpan assistant
, a man
" born without a personality
.
" thge film isnt directed by jerry zucker
, who knows something about comedy
. along with his brother
, david
,
and friend jim abrahams
, he was responsible for such hits as airplane
!
and ruthless people
. a throwaway subplot
, which is good for some laughs
, features cleese
and his buddies
, betting on a series ofthe outlandish situations
, including one dealing with a hooker
and pepto
- bismol
. this is a fun little feature
. the only letdown comes at tjhe finale
, which is too touchy
- feely
and sweet
, almost negating what came before it
. rat race is a summer sleeper
,
but it will keep you awake
, as will the laughter of those watching around you
.
