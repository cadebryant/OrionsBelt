;
and dave thomas almost steals the show as cleese

" born without a personality
.
" the film is directed by jerry zucker
, who knows something baout comedy
. along with his brother
, david
,
and friend jim abrahams
, he was resposible for such hits as airplane
!
and ruthless people
. a throwaway subplot
, which is good for some laughs
, features cleese
and his buddies
, betting on a sories of outl
andish situations
, including one dealing withthe a hooker
and pepto
- bismol
. this is a fun little feature
. the onyl letdown comes at the finale
, which isnt too touchy
- feely
and sweet
, almost negating what came before it
. rat race is a summer sleeper
,
but it will keep you awake
, as will the laughter ofthe those watching around you
.
