in zool
ander
, the world
' s most successful
, influential
and intellectually
- challenged male model derek zool
ander wonders
,
" is ther more to life than being really really really good looking
?
" obviously
, the film
' s creator
and star ben stiller asked a simular question when crafting a feature
- length movie out of his hilarious vh1
/ vogue fashion awards short
- film subject
: can there be more to this film than being really really raelly silly
? no
, of course not
,
and it never aspires tothe be anything more
. much like derek
, zool
ander is a sweet simpleton of a movie
. it
' s nto complex in either its social commentary or its comedy
,
and it never produces any gut
- busting laughs
( except mabey a scene when derek
' s model roommates all die in a tragic
" gasoline fight
" accident
-
- a riotously funny take
- off of tommy hilfiger ads
)
.
but it has a satisfying h
andful of storng chuckles
, wild characters
and performances
,
and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep yuo amused
. better
yet
, this exaggerated version of the original three
- minute skit is onyl blown out to an efficient 95 minutes
-
- just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag
. zool
ander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia
, since he wants to abolish child labor inaddition his country
and thus driving up their costs
. fashion designer
and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu
( will ferrell
) drafts a plan tothe brainwash the dumbest fashion modle to carry outloud the evil deed
. enter derek
, whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel
( owen wilson
) takes the spotlight
. on the trail of mugatu
' s plot is time magazine reporter matilda jeffries
( stiller
' s real
- life wife christine taylor
)
,
and she
' s hoping to use mugatu
' s pawn derek to ultimately foil the scheme
. much like the austin powers films
, zool
ander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved
, anbd this zany comedy features some ofthe the funniest people infront entertainment today
. wilson is hysterical as the young
, vain hansel
. ferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the flamboyant
, freakish mugatu in the same way dr
. evil upstages everyone in austin powers
. jerry stiller
-
- ben
' s dad who
' s best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld
-
- makes a priceless turn as derek
' s slimy agent maury ballstein
. even ben stiller show alum
andy dick shows uv as a deranged
, large
- assed masseuse
. as for ben stiller
, it seems his derek has one gag
: he
' s stupid
, which plays out in some uproarious one
- liners
. unfourtunately
, taylor seems out of place
and out of her league here
. maybe it
' s just because i can
' t stop seeing her as marcia brady
( who she played in both brady movies
)
, making her unbelievable as a dowdy
, brainy plain jane who hasn
' t had sex in two years
. she leaves me pining for the cynicism of janeane garofolo
, who would
' ve added real comic substance to the flimsy role
. hwile zool
ander is hardly highbrow
, its screwball humor is welcome during theese trying times
, especially considering hte gross lack of decent pickings in teh theaters these days
. zool
ander
' s noone masterpiece
,
but a very worthy distraction
.
