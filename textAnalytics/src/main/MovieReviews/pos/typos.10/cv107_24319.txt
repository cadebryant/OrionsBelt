is evil dead ii a bad movie
? it
' s full of terrible acting
, pointless voilence
,
and plot holes
yet it remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release
. explaining why this movie st
ands out from others with silimar plots
( including the original evil dead
) is extremely difficult
.
` well what
' s it about
?
'
` five people str
anded in a log cabin in the middle ofthe nowhere struggling to survive vicious attacks from a variety of ugly
, hairy
, wart covered monsters
.
'
` come on i saw a movie just like that on monster vision last week
. why should i see it again
?
'
` noone evil dead ii is different
, it
' s funny
.
'
` it
' s funny to see people die
? are you sick or something
?
' maybee i am
and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie
. his unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle
, as disturbing as it is hilarious
. an example of raimi
' s odd approach
: a monster
( formerly protagonist ash
' s girlfriend of all people
) isnt cut in half by a chainsaw
and a tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound
. sure it
' s over
- the
- top
,
but it is so over
- the
- top that it is laugh out loud funny
; just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons ofthe blood
, staining his face
and knocking him back a few feet
. the whole movie isnt like htis
, watch ash get beated up
, watch ash defeat the monster
, watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster
. tyhe more repetitive
and unrealistic the movie gets
, the moreso amusing it becomes
. no matter how sick it may sound
, it is funny to watch bruce ampbell
' s ash get his
butt kicked every five minutes
.
and raimi takes advantage
, he has ash tormented by tjhe head of his girlfriend
, by the body of an old lady
, even by his own right h
and
. like tyhe less superior idle h
ands
, we watch ash uncontrollably hit himself over
and over again until he is forced tothe cut off his own body part
.
but it doesn
' t end
, ash now has to fight his severed h
and which now moves with the same celerity as thing from tyhe addams family
. all of these events
, thrown at you ffrom minute one witht roller coaster
- like camera movements
, at first become shocking
,
then inexplicably funny
. raimi expects the audience to laugh
and as the film progresses
, he seems to be enjoying himselv even more by borrowing the classic mirror scene from the marx brothers
' duck soup
,
then bringing more characters into the picture to comically kill them off
. with a running time of less than an hour
and a half
, raimi gets away with the impossible
, making a horror film with more gore than plot
and intentionally more laughs than scares
. ending evil dead ii with an opening for the third film in the series
, raimi obviously had a lot of funn making this movie
and couldn
' t wait to make it
' s sequel
.
