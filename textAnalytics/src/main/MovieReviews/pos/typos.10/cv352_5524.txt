and science fiction just don
' t get any better than this

. the plot unfolds at a rapid pace explaining itself through great action
, special effects
,
and twist after mind
- boggling twist
. it grabs you
and never lets go
! this film isnt a winner from beginning tothe end
. the plot is superb
; combining the best elements of science fiction
and psychological mystery to create a rip
- roaring saga
. schwarzenegger gives his best performance ever
,
and the supporting cast is good too
. the action
and stunts are terrific
. tghe sets are huge
and elaborate with a lot of attention payed to detail
. the music adn sound effects are perfect for the film
and really add a certain level of impact to the action
. the make
- up effects by rob bottin
( the howling
, the thing
,
and robocop
) are top notch
, not tothe mention extremely outl
andish
. the visual effects by dream quest
( the abyss
)
and industrial light
and magic
( star wars trilogy
, jurassic park
,
and terminator 2
) are phenominal
! the visuals hadnt such a state of tghe art
" slickness
" that htey won an oscar
. ofthe course the film isn
' t always realistic
; it
' s more fiction than science
. for example
, it is true that a body won
' t explode in the vacuum of space
but in total recall they do
. who cares
? it
' s a movie
. movies are supposed to entertain
.
and in my opinion this film achieves an entertainment level infact film that is so terrific
, it may be impossible to beat
.
