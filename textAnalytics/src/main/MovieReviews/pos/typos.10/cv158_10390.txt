with more adn more television shows having gay characters
,
and even the infamous
" ellen
" sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian
, the movie industry too seems to be gaining more
and more homosexual based plot lines
. hte birdcage was critically acclaimed
, as was thsi years chasing amy
.
then along came in
& out
, anbd all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released
. it
' s aslo noticeable that this
" alternative lifestyle
" becomes less
and less taboo as the years go by
,
and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort
. while it
' s a very serious issue to many
, it is the comedies that people are flocking to see
and that are gaining notoriety
.
but the way we
' re useing comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically
. while the gay community was once very stereotyped
and used to laugh
* at
*
, it is more
and omre becoming something we laugh
* with
*
,
and when a movie like infact
& out comes along
, it isnt something that both heterosexuals
and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy
. it doesn
' t poke fun at the lifestyle
, it simply uses it tothe all it
' s comedic capacity
, just as love
, sex
, marriage
, birth
, death
,
and anything else hasnt been
. the idea for in
& out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar fo portraying an aids
- afflicted gay man in philadelphia
. if you remember
, during his acceptance speech
, hanks gave a highly emotional tri
bute to hte gay community
,
and even sighted a fromer gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life
. it
' s a serious
and touchy subject
, bu producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy
,
and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick
. it
' s true that if this same film had beeen written by a heterosexual
, it may have been more controversial
,
but because it was writed by an openly gay writer
, the prerogative was set
. kevin kline
, who only seems tothe become mroe
and more acclaimed
, stars as howard brackett
, a high skool english teacher in the small
, picturesque town ofthe greenleaf
, indiana
. after a three
- year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery
( joan cusack
)
, a wedding date has been set
,
and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story
- greenleaf high graduate cameron drake
( matt dillon
) is up for a best actor oscar
. the small town eagerly awaits both events
,
and both seem quite astronomical
, bu littel does anyone know how much one will affect teh other
. when cameron drake is announced thge winner
, the excitement is heightened as he pays tri
bute to his high school english teacher
, mr
. brackett
. everyone is cheering back in greenleaf
- that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words
,
"
and he
' s gay
.
" the town becomes silent as the entire populatoin joins in a simultanous jaw drop
. the thing is
, nobody
, including howard
, can underst
and how cameron cameback to that conclusion
, adn such wild
and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf
. naturally the questions pour from howard
' s fiancee
, parents
( debbie reynolds
& wilford brimley
)
, students
,
and the high school
' s principal
, tom halliwell
( bob newhart
)
, anbd the evidence starts tothe become more
and more obvious
: howard is clean
, neat
, honest
, sincere
, a romantic
,
and perhaps the most incriminating fact
, he loves barbara streis
and
. the frenzy isn
' t helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine
and
" enteratinment tonight
" wannabe show up at greenleaf high tje very next morning
. one particular repertwar is peter malloy
( tom selleck
) of
" inside entertainment
"
, who unlike the collage of other reporters
, wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett
, including coverage of his wedding
. the intrusion is all
but welcome by howard
, who is going more
and more out of his mind with each passing minute
. it seems that noone matter where he turns
, a camera is being shoved in his face
and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees
. the dominoes begin to tumble as howard
' s closest friends begin acting different
and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination ofthe employment should howard indeed be gay
. it all sounds very devastating
,
and it would be if it weren
' t presented with near
- perfection by one of this year
' s most delightful ensemble casts
. kline seems only to improve with age
,
and he is downright perfect here
. the great thing about this film is that every single character hasnt a moent to shine
,
and htey use it wonderfully
. every single actor turns in noe of theri best performances ever
. dillon has never been so likeable
, cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role
,
and brimley
, reynolds
, adn newhart all provide huge laughs when they
' re up to bat
. rudnick
' s script is heavily laced with wit anbd humor
,
and ytou
' ll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes
. while in
& out doesn
' t cary enough tothe give it four stars
, it remains one of the best done films of the year
, all
- around
. tyhe script is exuberant
, the actors are absolutely top
- notch
,
and we
' re allowed just the perfect blend of heart
- tugging so as not to bog down the laughs
. it remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety
, yot we
' re still allowed a sappily touching ending
. despite it
' s subject marter
,
and one scene tyhat comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex
, this is a movie that everyone could
,
and should
, enjoy
. frank oz
, best known as a voice talent for muppets
, directs this film quite delightfully
, useing all the potential rudnick
' s scirpt has to offer
, which turns outloud to be quite a bit
. check this one out
. you
' ll ahev a gay old time
.
