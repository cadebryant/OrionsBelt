i hadnt been expecting more of this movei than the less than thrilling twister
. twister was good
but had noone real plot
and no one to simpithize wiht
.
but twister had amazing effects
and i was hoping so would volcano volcano starts with tommy lee jones at emo
. he worrys about a small earthquake enough to leave his daughter at home with a baby sitter
. there is oney small quake
then another quake
.
then a geologist points out to tommy that its takes a geologic event to heat millions of gallons of water in 12 hours
. a few hours later large amount of ash start to fall
.
then
.
.
.
. it starts
. thte volcanic eruption
.
.
.

.
.

. i was still good none the less
. it had excellent special effects

.
.
