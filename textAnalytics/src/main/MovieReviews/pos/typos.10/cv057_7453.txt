i had been expecting more of this movie than the less than thrilling twister
. twister was good
but had no real plot
adn no one to simpithize with
.
but twister had amazing effects
anbd i was hoping so would volcano volcano starts with tommy lee jones at emo
. he worrys about a small earthquake enough to leave his daughter at home with a baby sitter
. there is one small quake
then another quake
.
then a geologist points out to tommy that its takes a geologic event to heat millions of gallons ofthe water in 12 hours
. a few hours later large amount of ash strat to fall
.
then
.
.
.
. it starts
. thge volcanic eruption
.
.
.
