' s first film since tghe ill
- fated valmont
, columbia
' s the people vs
. larry flynt
, is a vastly entertaining
( if not particularly enlightening
) biopic of hustler publisher
and self
- made millionaire larry flynt
, who became an unlikely champion ofthe freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late 1970s
and early 1980s
. the film unweaves its tale in a chronological order
: we open with young
and dirt
- poor larry flynt annd his brother jimmy
, peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky
. cut to forward in time
, where the two flynt brothers
, now young men
, are running the struggling hustler go
- go clubs inaddition cincinnati
. the strip clubs are in a dire financial state
,
and in a last
- ditch effort to salvage the operations
, flynt decides to go to a print shop
and churn out a promotional newsletter
. tihs evolved into the adult periodical
_ hustler
_ magazine
, creating larry flynt a vast financial empire
,
and yhe rest is history
. what sets flynt aart from other publishers is his struggles against those who owudl ahev him cease publication of his adult material
,
and who railed
and preached against him
- flynt spent time in incarceration
and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt
-
and his driven
, single
- minded insistence to buck the system
and fight for his freedom of expression
, regardless of personal cost
. the people vs
. larry flynt also weaves in the bittersweet story of flynt
' s true love
, althea leasure
, whom he meets as a dancer in his club
and later marries
,
and who devotedly st
ands alongside him throughtout his trials
and tribulations
. considering the serious nature of the film
' s theme
- the importance of teh united states
' frist amendment
- the people vs
. larry flynt is surprisingly
and wonderfully light
- hearted
and humourous
. much of the comedy is elicited from larrry flynt
' s outl
andish stunts at his courtroom appearances
- some of his chosen apparel isnt hilarious
-
and for the most part these elements ofthe the film work far better than some of the more dramatic points
, such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at a free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity
. the film
' s focus is on the flynt
' s many battles over first amendment rights annd freedom of speech
,
but thte heart of the peple vs
. larrry flynt isnt the touching love story between flynt
and althea
. larry flynt isnt shown as being occassionally gruff
, harsh
,
and overtly aggressive with his firends
and colleagues
,
but with althea
, we see his loving
, affectionate side
. htere
' s a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on a ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking
. ultimately
, the emotional power that the film hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors
,
but from the strength of flynt
and althea
' s love for each other
. woody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly a career
- topping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt
. harrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness
and confident stubborness to make him endearing anbd entirely sympathetic to the audience
,
and a very compelling protagonist for the film
. courtney lveo plays althea leasure inaddition a startling turn
, completely raw
and impulsive
. it
' s a very solid performance
, brash anbd naturalistic
,
and love is extremely compelling
; it
' s difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen
,
and her chemistry with harrelson is dead
- on
. edward norton
, as flynt
' s straight
, level
- headed lawyer is often upstaged by his flashier co
- stars in the people vs
. larry flynt
, much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes
,
but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of tghe film
. one can sense the frustration that norton
' s character feels when harrelson
' s free
- talking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind
,
and this results in a heightened emotional punch when norton
' s isaacman has the opportunity to sway the supreme court judges
. milos forman keeps the film moving
-
al
though it runs over two hours
, it never drags
-
and his direction ofthe the film is very effective
, eliciting a great deal ofthe empathy for a subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid
and unsympathetic
. there
' s also a gerat visual technique which forman uses to indicate the passing of time in one shot
, which is both clever
and extremely entertaining
. two minor quibbles with the film
- it certainly seems like the people vs
. larry flynt is in a rush to get to its main theme
, with flynt battling against authorities
and the system for his freedom of speech
. consequently
, the first thirty mintues of the film
, introducing anbd setting uv the characters
, seem unduely rushed
; perhaps it is mearly due to the fatc that these characters are so interesting
,
but i felt it would have worked better if this route ws taken in a more leisurely fashion
. it also felt like there was a distinctive lack of insight into the intertube workings of these characters
- the film clearly shows what flynt
, althea
, isaacman
,
and rev
. jerry faldwell did
,
and on a superficial levle some of thier motivations
, bu it never seemed like one could really underst
and the characters on a deeper level
. forthe exemple
, why larry flynt was compelled by ruth carter stapleton
( president carter
' s sister
) to be born
- again is a mistery to me
.
then again
, perhaps it was tothe him as well
. these two points don
' t detract greatly from the film
. the people vs
. larry flynt is certainly among the very best studio
- released films ofthe 1996
,
and works both as a ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech
and the depths to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression
,
and as a touching love story
.
