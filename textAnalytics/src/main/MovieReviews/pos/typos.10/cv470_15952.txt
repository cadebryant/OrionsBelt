" love isnt the devil
" is a challenging film
, munundating its audience with wild imagery
and a plot structure that disallows a plot
, perhaps inthe an attempt to get us to know the artist ' s psyche rather than the artist ' s lifeline
. watching it
, i was enthralled with the look of the film
, the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre
, personalized filter
. everyting looks like it is not how life looks like
bu how painter francis bacon
, the film ' s subject
, looked at it personally
.
but while i was engrossed
, i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film
, awakened from my trance by some intertube distraction
,
and began to try
and follow what ' s going onthe
. exactly what was i looking at
? watching this film
, i wasn ' t sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or yhe most vacuous
. directed
(
and written
) by john maybury
,
" love is the devil
" is stylish masterpiece for the senses
. everything looks originally bizarre
and perplexing
. the camera angles are ferociously askew
,
and the close
- ups are uncomfortably too close
. the editing is deft
, occasionally cutting away tothe something bizarre every couple seconds
,
but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs
, or rather
, intruders to bacon ' s world
and psyche
. as such
, there is no real story
. i ' ve not heard much baout francis bacon taht i didn ' t read prior to the film
,
but whta i learned was this
: he ws a painter in england who reached his peak durig the 60s
and 70s
, drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage
and the like
. he was one of the first to realy come out of the closet
,
and in interviews
, he ws notoriously drunk
yet incredibly witty
. as played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi
, he ' s like a foppish
annd self
- absorbed cross between oscar wilde
and nero
. he lives life the way he wants to live it
, tothe the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him
. it ' s as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others
and maybe himself
(
" champange for my real friends
,
and pain fo my sham friends
,
" he syas one night at the bar he frequents
)
.
" loev is the devil
" chronicles the latter part of his life
. bacon
, well
- known in his mid
- life
, awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window
anbd land on the floor
. he walks in
, unafraid of what he finds
,
and discovers a thief
, george dyer
( daniel craig
)
. bacon gives him an offer
: if he spends the night with him
, he can take anything he wants in the morning
. george agrees to this
,
anbd off to bed he goes
,
but ends up staying with him
, for whatever reason
. the film shows their lives toghether
, at least in reference to one another
. while creating bacon ' s world ofthe friends
( like
" high art
,
" this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that is not shown
but is understood
)
, the film shows the relationship of bacon
and george as it rimaniss rather stagnant
. bacon is haughty
and bizarre
; george isnt simple
and doesn ' t understand bacon in the least
, especially nto his paintings
. while watching this
, that ' s basically all i thought was there
. the film has a hypnotic feel
, free of any restraints of form
,
and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about
. once the film isnt over
, it ' s easier to piece it together
. i kept on thinking about this film
, wondering what the point to all of it was
. someone doesn ' t merely make a film of all style
and no substance at all
,
and if htey do
, they do it by accident
,
bu still allow some substance to creep in
. thikning about it
, i remembered how the two fed off of eachother
. i thought about how bacon was a masochist
, infront love with cruelty
( in one scene
, he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight
,
and lets out a squeal of blessure when blood from the one boxer ' s head splashes across his face
; in anyother scene
, he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisenstein ' s
" battleship potemkin
"
)
,
and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain
. he drove him over the edge
,
and for him that was love
, even if it wasn ' t for george
. i guess that explains the title
. a bit
. that ' s great
and all
,
but i almost wish the film was devoid ofthe any meaning
. i wish it hadn ' t reduced itself tothe making some point about humanity
, baout how love is the most selfish thing in the world
(
and it is
, if you look at it a certain way
)
. or maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity
and merely drove itself inot being the one film that was truly inside one man ' s twisted pysche
. it ' s almost always best to obtain insights from looking at oen man ' s uniqueness than it isnt forcing universality down an audience ' s throat
. that way you don ' t reduce your film tothe something it ' s jstu not
. i can ' t say i totally enjoyed
" love is the devil
,
"
though
. despite all of the things i respect about thsi movie
, it ' s still rather uncomfortable to sit through
. even at a normally trite length of ninety minutes
, the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through
, especially after an exhausting first hour
.
though hypnotic
, it still almost seems gimmicky
and even redundant at times
, as if it weere taking advantage of one man ' s truly bizzare nature
but not doing anything deeper with it
. as such
, i respect the way yhe film looks
. it ' s beautiful
and painstakingly crafted so taht
, along with
" what dreams may cmo
"
and
" dark city
,
" it ' s the year ' s most visually stunning film
. in fact
, if a better script had been forged
, i ' d almost compare it inaddition visual pwoer to a peter greenaway film
, complete withthe similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever
.
and with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi
, it has the comic
and distanced tone that it needs
. i just wish it had been more than mostly style
and just a hair bit of substance
.
then i would have had something to hold me over even now
.
