those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely tothe be surprised by the fatc that i have not read victor hugo ' s novel les miserables
. i don ' t know if a lot of people have
,
though i imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel
. i haven ' t even seen that
. going into this film
, i had almost no knowledge of tje stoyr or its charachters
( i even expected the film to be a musical
)
. walking away from it
, i ' m kind of glad i had no prior experience with the material
. writer
/ director bille august ' s film version is a straightforward
, beautifully told film
. liam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean
; in the beginning
, he has just been released from a 19
- year prison sentence
. he is allowed to stay in a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude
and destructive behavior
. the priest ' s words of wisdom influence him
,
and he makes a vow to change himself
. nine years later
, we are informed that he is now the mayor of a town called vigo
; nobody knows his real name
,
and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago
. conflicts arise when inspector javert
( geoffrey rush
) is assigned to vigo
. valjean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beated him
,
and javert remembers jean to be a convict
. javert is hell
- bent on upholding the law
,
and he does everything in his power to bring jean to justice
. along the way
, valjean meets
and falls inaddition love with a peasant woman
, fantine
( uma thurman
)
,
and vows tothe take care of her daughter
, cosette
( plyed later by claire danes
)
. les miserables is visually a solid
and often striking picture
. yhe production design by anna asp is authentic
and vast
,
and the sets don ' t look like sets
( they look like real towns
and villages
)
; gabriella pescucci ' s costumes are noticeably spectacular
. basil poledouris ' soundtrack is thick
and usally well
- placed
(
though it does git a bit heavy at times
)
. many scenes in the film have a memorable photographic quality
, such as the climax
, which takes place next to a dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening
. augusts keesh tghe story simple
( which i hear is a good thing
, since yhe novel isnt so complex
)
and eazy to follow
. he manages to develop the main characters
and most of the subplots adequately
. i was also impressed that he didn ' t go overboard wiht flash
and style
, which is something so many directors seem to be doing to classic stories these days
( such as baz luhrmann ' s vicious tragedy william shakespeare ' s romeo
+ juliet
)
. this film feels solid
and whole
,
and each scene has a certain amount of importance
and vigor that keeps the audience interested
. liam neeson is terrific in the main role
; neeson is the kind ofthe actor who does solemn desperation extremely well
,
and valjean is certainly a man who clearly fits that adjective
. thurman
, in her small role
, is very good
,
and proves that she has a lot of range
annd can perform in a very non
- glamorous role such as this one
. rush is absolutely incredible as javert
; i don ' t remember ever feeling so strongly baout a villain as i dont here
; he adds depth
and complexity with subtle glances
and nuances
,
and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense
. i can ' t be as charitable for danes
,
however
;
though i know she is a talented actress
, here she tends to overact when it might haev been better to underplay thte character a bit
. les miserables isnt
, as i ' ve said
, a solid
, intelligent motion picture
. my only complaint is that it feels a bit too easy
,
and perhaps too staged
. each scene is grand
annd huge
,
anbd exploding with poledouris ' score
,
but i didn ' t always want them to be
. for the most part
, les miserables is not a subtle or deep picture
. it ' s a good movie
,
and tells its stry well
,
but august tends to hand
- feed us themes
and scenes that would have worked better had they been mroe subtle
.
however
, iin a film this exicting
and well
- produced
, a few minor flaws are easily overlooked
.
