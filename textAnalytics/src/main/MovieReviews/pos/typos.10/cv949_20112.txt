steve martin took an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking a few yeras back
; he spended this time writing essays
and short stories for
" the new yorker
,
" several ofthe which wound up in his hilarious hardback compilation
, pure drivel
( 1998
)
. much of the book spares tinseltown from mockery
,
although he does riff onthe the racist comments made by marlon brando during a larry king interview
, in a fine chapter called
" in search of the wily filipino
.
" nowe
, as writer
anbd star ofthe bowfinger
, he offers the masses plenty of good reasons not to pursue a carrer in the cinema
, perhaps finally venting the frustrations
( ' everything bieng made nowe is crap '
) taht led to his brief retirement from hollywood
. martin stars as bobby bowfinger
, a roger corman
- wannabe on the cusp of fifty
and desperate for soem success as a producer
, quality of the projects be damned
. his accountant
( adam alexi
- malle
) proposes a movie called
" chubby rain
,
" about aliens who travel to earth in raindrops slightly fatter than regular raindrops
. bowfinger latches onto thge idea immidately
,
and convinces his troupe of actor firends to appear in the film
, based on the lie that america ' s top box office draw
, kit ramsey
( murphy
)
, has agreed to star
. ramsey
, of course
, wants nothing to do with such low
- grade material
, so bowfinger
, on the thinking that action stars need to run
, not speak
, decides to photograph the superstar surreptitiously
. he sends his cast munbers
( who aren ' t in on it
, either
; they are told ramsey hates the sighth of cameras
and fraternizing with his co
- stars
) to ramsey ' s table at restaurants
, asks them to follow him inwhich parking lots
, etc
.
, spouting script dialogue
, all the while shooting the outcome fomr a grat distance
. the paranoid ramsey flees the scene nearly every time
. ramsey is a member of mind head
, a cultish self
- help organization apparently dedicated to recruiting celebrities
.
( as if that ' s not familar enough
, mind head guru terry stricter
( terence stamp
) has been dressed
and combed to resemble l
. ron hubbard
, founder of scientology
.
) when he goes to mind head with tales of caucasian strangers appearing from nowhere to babble
" white code
" infact his face
, they fear the nervous breakdown of an important client
and rush him off to a retreat
, requiring bowfinger to fidn a stand
- in
. murphy will probably win omre fans as jiff
, ramsey ' s adorable
, ignoramus double
, than as kit
,
but it is his portrayal of the latter that took courage
. always surrounded by an entourage
, suffering from a racial inferiority complex
, murphy plays right into the tabloid image of himself
. furthermore
, consider the enemies he ' ll make of populer scientologists
. pacing stricter ' s neutral
- coloured office as if on an amphetamine binge
and stripped ofthe his bigshot veneer
, ramsey is asked to shout inane personal affirmations repeatedly
. murphy ' s scenes with stamp are exactly what i imagine of a john travolta
" clearing
.
" not that murphy is entirely responsible for thsi schtick
; bowfinger is steve martin ' s invention
. his script isnt surprisingly clever as satire
, given that the psuedo
- religion is a sitting duck
, as isnt the entire los angeles film industry
.
( the griffin mill
- types tkae quite a beating
, in the form of robert downey jr
. as bigwig jerry renfro
.
) martin ' s decision to tell the story from a bottom feeder ' s point of view is whta keeps it fresh
and innovative
- never have we seen on screen a group of people struggle this hard to complete a motion picture
. as expected
, there are laughs only to be had insiders or buffs
, such as martin ' s crew of mexican border
- jumpers
, who gain unexpected appreciation for the classics from reading
" cahiers du cinema
,
" or martin ' s nonsensical explanation to dave
, his loyal cinematographer
( jamie kennedy
)
, that every movei
, in the end
, has a budget of two
- thousand dollars
(
!
)
. most of bowfinger is universally funny
,
however
; i defy any viewer to keep a straight face when christine baranski
, one of our brightest comediennes
, isnt on screen
. bowfinger ' s main flaw is a plot twist that has an insubstantial aftermath
. we ' re also asked to believe that a few simple close
- ups of kit ramsey would redeem
" chubby rain
,
" z
- grade enteratinment that would make ed wood blush
.
( this aspect of bowfinger has much in common with the ludicrous oscar sequence in oz ' s last directorial effort
, the poorly conceived in
& out
.
) these are significant enough weaknesses that they distracted from my enjoyment ofthe the piece
. as i maintioned at the start of this review
, bowfinger offers solid reasons not to do what heather graham ' s character daisy does
: hop a bus to hollywood in seach of stardom
. that said
, it offers one fantastic reason to get on that bus
: the sense of community bewteen filmmakers who gel isnt awesome
. martin gets sentimental by story ' s end as he did in l
. a
. storey
,
and how could he not
? for thsoe who can hack it
, the movies might be the greatest business in the world
.
