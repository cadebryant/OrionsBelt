if there
' s one thing in common about all of hollywood
' s major studios
, it
' s that their productions are moving toward mainstream more annd more
.
al
though twentieth century fox
and newyorker line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures
( fox searchlight
and fine line respectivly
)
, it
' s obvious there
' s no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater
. so when a movie liek gary ross
' pleasantville comes along
, wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas
and served up on a platter of fine production
, it
' s a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes
.
al
though the atmosphere
and buzz about the movie are cheery
and lighthearted
, pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no
-
thought movie
. quite the opposite is true
, in fact
, as directer ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense
and intelligent undertones to the screen
. the story
, both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation
, captures the essence of statement
- making in the cinema
. not in recent memory hasnt a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distri
bution
,
and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross
' work
, it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy anough
. kudos to both he
and his production stff for putting together this fine picture
. it stars tobey maguire
and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who
, through quite a bited ofthe luck
, find themslves zapped into a fifties sitcom named
" pleasantville
.
" maguire
, as the reserved bud parker
, is perfect for the pseudo
- world
;
but the rebellious mary sue
( witherspoon
) is not at all made for the father
- knows
- best times
. it
' s not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end
,
and begins to teach the townspeople
- in a quite unlikely way
- what life is
* really
* like
. soon hues of color creep into the black
and white world
,
and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism
, others fear the strangeness
. at one end is a soda shop owner
- turned
- painter named mr
. johnson
( jeff daniels
)
and at tghe other end is a close
- minded mayor
( j
. t
. walsh
)
and his chamber of comerce
; bu the two sides are simpley fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town
. fine performances are turned in all around
. maguire
and witherspoon are effective as the leads
,
but the true complements go out to jeff daniels
and j
. t
. walsh
( in his latest
and final postumus performance
)
. daniels brings an atmosphere of awe
, inspiration
,
and hope to his carachter
, whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness
- almost to the point where ytou can sense gene hackman
' s envy
. fo daniels
, it
' s his most commendable performance of the last three eyasr
- or mroe
-
and for walsh
, it
' s a complementary exclamation point on a fine career
. also of lesser onot is the supporting role by joan allen
,
and in viewing the entire cast works well together from strat to finish
. htere
' s not much to dislike about pleasantville
,
and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for thsoe who want serious as well as those who don
' t
.
