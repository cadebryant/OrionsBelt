to paraphrase a song title from an earlier disney movie
, mulan isnt a whole new world
. the mouse factory
' s latest feature is a treasure
, featuring magnificient animation
, a strong stopry
and finely drawed characters
. mulan isnt the story of a fiesty
, head
- strong young woman who
, unlike other disney heroines
, isn
' t seeking her prince charming
, mulan
' s motivations are simple
; to save her father
, serve her country
and find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say
. the story of mulan takes palce in ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation
. teh emperor has called for a conscription
, one man from eahc family to join the army
and defend the nation
. mulan
' s crippled father is called
,
but mulan sneaks off
, steals his armor
and takes his place
. mulan is a saga of courage
and self
- discovery
.
yet
, despite the grim backdrop of war
, it is a livley tale of self
- reliance
and brain
- over
- brawn tyhat even the smallest child can appreciate
and enjoy
. the movie utilizes a strong corps of asian
- american talent as the voices for the main characters
, inlcuding tjhe wonderfull ming
- na wen
( tjhe joy luck club
) as mulan
, b
. d
. wong as shang
, mulan
' s comm
anding officer
and later love interst
, pat morita as the emperor
and the veteran soon
- tek oh as mulan
' s proud
,
but loving father
. also adding to the proceedings is eddie murphy as mushu the dragon
, sent by mulan
' s ansestors to watch over
and help the young woman
. his fast
, wise
- cracking
, hip
- talking mushu may seem out of place
,
but it
' s a crowd pleasing performance
, especially for the youngsters
. the movie features only a cuple of songs
, fewer than most previous disney animated flicks
,
but mulan
' s are winners
. the music by matthew wilder
and lyrics by david zippel fit nicely into the plot
. the overall score by jerry goldsmith also is a plus
. mulan is a treat
, more powerful than hercules
, with omre heart than the hunchback of notre dame
. at about 85 minutes
, mulan moves rapidly
,
and will hold the attention of youngsters from beginning to the end
. mulan will set a new st
andard by whcih future animated efforts by disney
and other studios will have to work hard tothe attain
. also
, it is hoped that tghe success of mulan
,
and there is no doubt that it will prove to be a popular vehicule
, will spur an interest for more movies witht oriential or aisian
- american themes so as to provide more substantial roles for the talented performers who gave their voices for this production
. it would be nice to see them on screen as well as hear them
. committed to lifelong learning through effective communication
