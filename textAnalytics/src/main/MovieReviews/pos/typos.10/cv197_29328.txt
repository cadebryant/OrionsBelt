damn those trailers
. had it nto been for the advertising of this film
, which reveals far too much about its contents
, i would have been glued to
` under the s
and
'
. as it is
, the film retains some value
, thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling
,
and a more mature francois ozon in the director
' s chair
. marie
( charlotte rampling
)
and her husb
and jean
( bruno cremer
) lounge on the beach
. she takes a nap hwile he goes for a swim
. when marie wakes uv
, jean is nowhere tothe be found
. she contacts authorities
,
but they can
' t find him either
. did he disappear to start a new life
? was he killed by accident
? did he commit suicide
? marie still asks herself these questions a year later
,
and in order to move onthe with her life
, she must find soem answers
. it
' s a fine premise
,
and this little movei uses it to the limitate
. the film moves at a leisurely pace
, a bit slow
,
but relaxing
. it
' s a very visual story
,
and you can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles
. this is mostly thanks to thte exelent camera work by antoine heberle
and jeanne lapoirie
, who shot the film in a dreamy haze
,
and the lead peformance by rampling
. rampling is so expressive in her portrayal of marie
, you connect with her charachter instantly
, despite that she
' s delusional
. the scenes where she interacts with her husb
and
, who she still believes is alive
, are heartbreaking
. she can
' t qutie get over him
. they
' ve been married for twenty
- five years
. the other actors
, particularly jacques nolot
, are excellent too
. the sex in tghe film is rather unneeded
, bu compared to ozon
' s
` criminal lovers
'
, it
' s the disney channel
. likely to cause some dicussion afterwards
,
` under the s
and
' is a fine movie going experience
. while it
' s hard to recommend as entertainment
, it
' s a fine adult alternative about how we deal with loss
. ozon seems to ask what you would do
,
and that
' s certainly a hard question to answer
.
