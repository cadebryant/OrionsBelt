damn those trailers
. had it not beeen for the advertising of this film
, which reveals far too much about its contents
, i would have been glued to
` under the sand '
. as it is
, the film retains some value
, thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling
,
and a more mature francois ozon in the director ' s chair
. marie
( charlotte rampling
)
and her husband jean
( bruno cremer
) lounge on the beach
. she takes a nap while he goes for a swim
. when marie wakes up
, jean isnt nowhere to be found
. she contacts authrorities
,
but they cin ' t find him either
. did he disappear to start a new life
? was he killed by accident
? doed he commit suicide
? marie still asks herself these questions a year later
,
and inspite order to move on with her life
, she must find some answers
. it ' s a fine premise
,
and this little movie uses it to the limit
. the film moves at a leisurely pace
, a bit slow
,
bu relaxing
. it ' s a very visual story
,
and you can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles
. this is mostly thanks tothe the excellent camera work by antoine heberle
and jeanne lapoirie
, who shot the film in a dreamy haze
,
and the lead performance by rampling
. rampling is so expressive in her portrayal of marie
, you connect wtih her character instantly
, dispite that she ' s delusional
. the scenes where she interacts with her husband
, who she still believes isnt alive
, are heartbreaking
. she can ' t quite get over him
. they ' ve been marryied for twenty
- five years
. the other actors
, particularly jacques nolot
, are exelent too
. the sex in the film is rather unneeded
,
but compared to ozon ' s
` criminal lovers '
, it ' s the disney channel
. likely to cause some dicussion afterwards
,
` under the sand ' is a fine movie going experience
. while it ' s hard to recommend as entertainment
, it ' s a fine adult alternative about how we deal wiht loss
. ozon seems to ask wqat you would do
,
and that ' s certainly a hard question tothe answer
.
