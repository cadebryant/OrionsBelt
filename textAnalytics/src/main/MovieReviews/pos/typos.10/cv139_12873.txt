one of tje last entries in the long
- running carry on series
, carry on behind is very similar to carry on camping in tht it involves a group ofthe holidaymakers descending on a
' caravan
' site
. professors anna vrooshka
( elke sommer
)
and rol
and crump
( kenneth williams
)
and a group of archaeology students stay infact the caravan site owned by major leep
( kenneth connor
) so that they can explore the nearby roman settlement remains
. anna has a little trouble underst
anding english
and sometimes people get the wrong end of the stick
:
- for instance
, when anna is asking for
' scrubbers for dirty caravan
'
, she means that she wants a scrubbing brush tothe clean the caravan
! arthur upmore
( bernard bresslaw
)
and his wife linda
( patsy rowl
ands
) take her mother daphne barnes
( joan sims
)
and her minah bird on holidya with them
. mother
- in
- law jokes prevail
. furthermore
, the trouble that joe adn norma baxter
( ian lavender
and adrienne posta
) have with their large irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between the two families
. fred ramsden
( windsor davies
)
and ernie bragg
( jack douglas
) leave their wives
( liz fraser adn patricia franklin
) behind for a fishing holiday
.
however
, they have more in mind than fishing when they catch sight of two young girls
, s
andra
( carol hawkins
)
and carol
( sherrie hewson
)
. the story involves the disruption caused by the archaeological professors of the day
- to
- day running of the camp
, teh search for the minah bid adn greyhound
, the major
, fred
and ernie
' s desperate need of a woman
, a misunderst
anding leading to a striptease at the caravan park
' s pub
,
and a shock in store for daphne
. the partnership between sommer
and williams is very effective
and amusing
. this is what binds the movei toghether
. joan sims st
ands out as yhe dem
anding mother
- inwhich
- law
, bernard bresslaw
and patsy rowl
ands work well together as husb
and
and wife
,
and carol hawkins
and sherrie hewson are a welcome addition to the cast
. on the otehr h
and
, there are low
- key performances ffrom kenneth connor
and peter
butterworth as barnes thte h
andyman
,
and there are very poor performances by windsor davies
and jack douglas who spend far too much time on the screen
! even
though there is no real plot to speak of
and the jokes are getting bluer due to the newyorker scriptwriter dave freeman
, there are enough truly comical moments anbd bright anbd breezy performances to lift this carry onthe above many of its predecessors
.
al
though the regular casted is depleted
, the ones that remain show thyat they can still make a good carry on film
. a relative flop at the cinema
, this movie deserves a lot more recognition
.
