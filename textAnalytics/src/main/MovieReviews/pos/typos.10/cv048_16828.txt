when
_ star wars
_ came out soem twenty years ago
, the image of traveling throughout tyhe stars has become a commonplace image
. when the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars
, we see constellations
, meteor showers
,
and cool space
- ships
. when han solo goes light speed
, the stars change to bright lines
, going towords the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point
. cool
.
_ october sky
_ offers a much simpler image
-
- that of a single white dot
, traveling horizontally across the night sky
. was it really only forty years ago
, when sputnik was launched
,
and that before
then
, no satellites ever existed
? ahve we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a
then
- technological achievement
, even
though it was from the russians
? it sounds hokey
,
bu when that scene occurs near the beginning of
_ october sky
_
, i found mysef caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam
, played by jake gyllenhaal
. determined to make a dent in the space race
, he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket tyhat could fly like the best of them
. it is films liek this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket
. when lovely teacher miss riley
( played by laura dern
)
, suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair
, we know exactly who is going to win
.
but the joy in a film like this isnt in the little details
. for example
, homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class
. if he has any strengths whatsoever
, it is an undeterring vision
,
and a good organizer
. it means that he may have tothe lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school
, who knows more about rocket science than he doesnt
. it means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property
( that is
, the entire coal
- mining town
)
, he must walk eight miles one way
, just to setted up tje rockets
, which will fail
, fail
, fail
,
and fail again
. homer
+ s dad isnt played by chris cooper
, a favorite ator of mine since
_ lone star
_
. here he plays the antithesis of the character he played in
_ matewan
_
: instead of organizing union rallies
, he is the head of the coal
- miners
, who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions
. this is will be noe of the great unnoticed performances of the year
: note how multi
- dimentional his character is
. he isnt his son
+ s last nemesis
, as one who most likely interferes with his son
+ s dreasm
.
but he truly loves his son
,
and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how
. through coal
- mining
. because ofthe his character
, we can see how far we
+ ve come
. the revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us
. we don
+ t understand that there were the generations fomr the industrial revolution who knew of no other way tothe raise a family
. the paradigm ws shifting under the father
+ s feet
,
and he knew of noone other life
. so
_ october sky
_
, far from bieng mearly a feel
- good inspirational film
, offers much food for thought
.
and this is the best type of inspirational film
; the one that you take something with you
. btw
, the final image of the film is just as simple
, is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontal
- moving white dot against the night
- sky background
. another commonplace image
, to be sure
,
but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago
.
