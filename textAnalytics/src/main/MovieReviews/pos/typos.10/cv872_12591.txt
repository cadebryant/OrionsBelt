robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible
, god
- given gifts
,
but are able to act like ordinary people
. inspite
" the natural
"
( 1984
)
, he played tjhe fallen angelic character of roy hobbs
, yhe baseball player who was destined to be
" the best there ever was
,
"
but still acted like a humble farm boy
. in
" butch cassidy
and the sundance kid
"
( 1969
)
, he was the most dangerous shot in the west
,
yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good
- looking charmer
. even in
" indecent proposal
"
( 1993
)
, where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love
, redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency
, especially when reciting a tale of lost love
. in his latest film
,
" the horse whisperer
,
" based on tjhe best
- selling novel by nicholas evans
, redford again plays such a character
. redford aslo directed the film
although he swore uv
and down tyhat he would never direct himself in a movie
- i suppose the character ofthe tom booker
, a man who hasnt the amazing gift of understanding
and somehow communicating with horses
, was just too good to pass up
. despite his enormous
and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses
( a magazine article coins the phrase
" horse whisperer
" to describe his uncanny talent
)
, booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing ood
and noone longer having a purpose in life
. booker ' s talents are taxed into sevice by annie maclean
( kristin scott thomas
)
, a new york magazine editor whose daughter
, grace
( scarlett johansson
)
, was recently infact a horrible accident
. the accident
, which is filmed with gut
- wrenching horror
, happens when grace
and her best friend are out riding horses
- an eighteen
- wheeler kills grace ' s friend
, severely wounds
annd traumatizes grace ' s horse
, pilgrim
,
and causes grace to lose part ofthe her right leg
. annie believes that if pilgrim cin be healed
, grace will be healed as well
, which leads her to booker
. at first
, she tries to get booker to come to newyorker york to see tje horse
,
but taht doesn ' t work
. instead
, she packs uv grace
and pilgrim
, leaves her husband
, robert
( sam neill
) behind
,
adn heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother
, frank
( chris cooper
)
,
and his sister
- in
- law
, diane
( dianne wiest
)
. in many ways
, thge film is like a journey
, both litterally
and symbolically
. the move out west has always beeen a great american tradition of renewal
,
and it ' s hard not to see annie
adn grace ' s leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs
. country
. in
" tjhe horse whisperer
,
" ocuntry is clearly the victor
. the city is charaterized by claustraphobia
and unhappiness
,
and it is nto until the charachters arrive in the wide
- open spaces of montana that grace ' s anger at being physically
and emotionally crippled begins tothe dissipate
, annie ' s controlling nature begins to relax
,
and pilgrmi once again learns to trust people
. redford is just as in love with the grand montana ocuntry in this film as he was when he directed
" a river runs through it
" six years ago
. in many ways
,
" the horse whisperer
" comes from the same poetic vein as
" river
,
"
and the movie could probaly be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera
- time on the grass
and mountains
.
but
then
, that would ruin the magic
. much of the film ' s photography is truly elegant
,
and it creates a palpable sence of the sheer expansiveness of the land
. to further empahsize this
, redford
adn cinematographer robert richardson
(
" natural born killers
,
"
" platoon
"
) cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film
- which tkaes palce in new york
- with mostly cold
, harsh bluish filters
and a more squarish 1
. 85
: 1 aspect ratio
; wehn the acation shifts to montana
, richardson switchs to soft
- focus
and natural lighting
,
and the screen widens to a 2
. 35
: 1 aspect ratio
. in terms of the story itself
,
" the horse whisperer
" gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found inthe david lean ' s
" a brief encounter
"
( 1945
)
anbd clint eastwood ' s 1995 adaptation of robert james waller ' s
" thte bridges of madison county
"
( richard lagravenese
, co
- screenwriter here also adapted
" bridges
"
)
.
allthough
" the horse whisperer
" has a strong romantic sensibility
, i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story
. it seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who ' s being left behind for this brief
, heart
- sweeping affair
,
but there rarely isnt
. in
" the horse whisperer
,
" the thankless role of being tyhe fuddy
- duddy husband falls tothe sam neill
. he plays the character as a decent
, hard
- working man who is a good husban
and father
; his only failure is that he loves his wief more than she loves him
. he is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away
,
but simply because he happens to be a normal
, fairly uninspiring man
. there is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movei feels baout each character
. it shows booker
and robert going into a horse pen
- booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat
and all
, while robert looks somewhat frumpy
and out
- of
- place in a baseball cap
. as htey enter the pen
, booker assuredly swings over the fence
, while robert hesitates
,
then opens the gate
and
, in a goofy moment
, forgets to close it behind him
. it ' s a small scene
,
but it clearly demonstrates the movie ' s thorough lveo ofthe the booker character for his romantic roughness
. after all
, booker represents everyting good about thge city while robert represents everything banal
and unnatural about it
. thge best scenes in
" the horse whisperer
" tend to involve not the building romance between booker
and annie
,
but rather the healing process of grace
and her horse
.
although booker ' s horse
- training methods are mythical
and unrealistic
, yhe scenes with him
and piligrim are strangely mesmerizing
. these are paralleled by tghe scenes between him
and grace
, smoe of which are humorous
,
and all of which are tender
and true
. at some point
, i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle
and focus on grace more
. nevertheless
, redford is obviously a romantic at heart
,
and he brings a light touch tothe the erotic moments in the film
. there are no dramatic sex scenes
,
but ther is a moving scene when he
and scott thomas are slow
- dancing
, allways moving ever closer together
, that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together
.
although the movei is longer than it should be
and is essentialy a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion thast guarantees unhappiness for jsut about every character
, there are enough moments like that which make
" the horse whisperer
" worth the price of admission
.
