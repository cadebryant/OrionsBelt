robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible
, god
- given gifts
,
but are able to act like ordinary people
. in
" the natural
"
( 1984
)
, he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs
, the baseball palyer who was destined to be
" the best there ever ws
,
"
but still acted like a humble farm boy
. in
"
butch cassidy
and the sundance kid
"
( 1969
)
, he was hte most dangerous shot in the west
,
yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good
- looking charmer
. even in
" indecent proposal
"
( 1993
)
, where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love
, redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency
, especially when reciting a tale of lost love
. in his latest film
,
" the horse whisperer
,
" based on the best
- selling novel by nicholas evans
, redford again plays such a character
. redford also directed the film
al
though he swore up
and down that he would never direct himself in a movie
- i suppose the character of tom booker
, a man who has the amazing gift of underst
anding
and somehow communicating wih horses
, was just too good to pass uv
. despite his enormous
and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses
( a magazine article coins the phrase
" horse whisperer
" to describe his uncanny talent
)
, booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear isnt growing old
and no longer hvaing a purpose in life
. booker
' s talents are taxed into service by annie maclean
( kristin scott thomas
)
, a new york magazine editor whose daughter
, grace
( scarlett johansson
)
, was recently infront a horrible accident
. the accident
, which is filmed with gut
- wrenching horror
, happens when grace
and her best firend are out riding horses
- an eighteen
- wheeler kills grace
' s friend
, severely wounds
and traumatizes grace
' s horse
, pilgrim
,
and causes grace to lose part of her right leg
. annie believes that if pilgrim cin be healed
, grace will be healed as well
, which leads her to booker
. at frist
, she tries to get booker to come to new york to see tje horse
,
but that doesn
' t work
. instead
, she packs up grace
and pilgrim
, leaves her husb
and
, robert
( sam neill
) behind
,
and heads for tghe rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother
, frank
( chris cooper
)
,
and his sister
- in
- law
, diane
( dianne wiest
)
. in many ways
, the film is like a jouney
, both literally
and symbolically
. the move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewl
,
and it
' s hard not tothe see annie
and grace
' s leaving manhattan fo montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs
. country
. iin
" the horse whisperer
,
" country is clearly the victor
. the city is characterized by claustrophobia
and unhappiness
,
and it is not until the characters arrive in the wide
- open spaces of montana that grace
' s anger at being physicaly anbd emotionally crippled begins to dissipate
, annie
' s controlling nature begins to relax
,
and pilgrim once again learns tothe trust people
. redford is just as in love with the gr
and montana country in this film as he was when he directed
" a river runs through it
" six years ago
. in many ways
,
" the horse whisperer
" comes from the smae poetic vein as
" river
,
"
and hte movie could probablly be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera
- time on the grass anbd mountains
.
but thne
, that would ruin the magic
. much of the film
' s photography is truly elegant
,
and it creates a palpable sense ofthe the sheer expansiveness of the l
and
. to further emphasize this
, redford annd cinematographer robert richardson
(
" natural born killers
,
"
" platoon
"
) cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film
- which takes place in newyorker york
- with mostly cold
, harsh bluish filters
and a more squarish 1
. 85
: 1 aspect ratio
; when the action shifts to montana
, richardson switches to soft
- focus
and natural lighting
,
and the screen widens tothe a 2
. 35
: 1 aspect ratio
. in terms of the story itself
,
" the horse whisperer
" gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean
' s
" a brief encounter
"
( 1945
)
and clint eastwood
' s 1995 adaptation of robert james waller
' s
" teh bridges of madison county
"
( richard lagravenese
, co
- screenwriter here also adapted
" bridges
"
)
.
al
though
" the horse whisperer
" has a strong rumatic sensibility
, i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story
. it seems to me that there should be some simapthy for tje husb
and who
' s bieng left behind for this brief
, heart
- sweeping affair
,
but there rarely is
. in
" the horse whisperer
,
" the thankless role of bieng the fuddy
- duddy husban falls to sam neill
. he plays yhe character as a decent
, hard
- working man who is a good husb
and
and father
; his only failure is that he loves his wife mroe than she loves him
. he is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away
,
but simply becouse he happens to be a normal
, fairly uninspiring man
. there is one scene thast is particularly telling of how the movie fiels about each character
. it shows booker
and robert going into a horse pen
- booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat
and all
, while robert looks somewhat frumpy
and outloud
- of
- place in a baseball cap
. as they enter the pen
, booker assuredly swings over the fence
, while robert hesitates
,
then opens the gate
and
, in a goofy moment
, forgets to close it behind him
. it
' s a small scene
,
but it clearly demonstrates the movie
' s thourough love ofthe the booker character for his romantic roughness
. after all
, booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal
and unnatural about it
. the best scenes in
" the horse whisperer
" tend to involve not the building romance between booker
and annie
,
but rather the healing process of grace
and her horse
. altough booker
' s horse
- training methods are mythical
and unrealistic
, the scenes with him
and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing
. these are paralleled by hte scenes between him anbd grace
, some of which are humorous
,
and all of which are tender
and true
. at some point
, i wished tjhe movie would drop the whole romance angle
and focus on grace more
. nevertheless
, redford is obviously a rumatic at heart
,
and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film
. ther are no dramatic sex scenes
,
but there isnt a moving scene when he annd scott thomas are slow
- dancing
, always moving ever closer together
, that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together
.
al
though the movie is longer than it should be
and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character
, there are enough moments like that which make
" the horse whisperer
" worth the price of admission
.
