what
' s shocking about
" carlito
' s way
" is how good it isnt
. having gotten a bit of a bad rap for not being a big box office hit like pacino
' s previous film
,
" scent of a woman
,
"
and nto having as storng a performance as he doed in thgat one
( he hadnt jsut won an oscar
)
,
" carlito
' s way
" was destined fo underrated heaven
. that
' s what it is
: an underrated gem of a movie
.
and whta a shame because pacino
and de palma both do amazing jobs with it
, annd turn it into a great piece of a pulpy charater study
.
" carlito
' s way
" deals wiht
, well
, carlito brigante
( pacino
)
, a puerto rican ex
- drug kingpin
, who gets out of a long jailterm when his coke
- addicted
, curly
- haired lawyer
( sean penn
) points out a legal technicality
. of course
, carlito was actually awoken in prison
,
and has decided to go straight
, even if he
' s really a crook at heart
. carlito
, liuke barry lyndon
, is a man who isnt trapped by fate at every turn
,
and can
' t escape into something he is not
. carlito
' s attempts at a clean
, legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn
. when he first gets out
, a friend of his ends up leading him into a big shoot
- out
, where he has to kill a couple people tothe survive
. he
' s constantly getting bugged by the government to see if he
' s doing anytying illegal
,
and his lawyer finds himself neck
- deep in a pile ofthe shit
, needing him to try
and help him out
, which includes him doing some prison breaking
. carlito
, like ratso rizzo
, wants to go to miami
( since
, according to film logic
, that
' s where it
' s at
)
,
but needs some funding
. being a legend
, he is quickly able to get a nice job runnung a big dance club
( this is the 70s
, by the way
, annd since some of this takes place in night clubs
, we get to hear all sorts of 70s classics
, including several k
. c
.
and the sunshine b
and tunes
- my personal favorite
)
. he gets a bodyguard
( the great luis guzman
, at his best
)
,
and is soon runnung a pretty good business
, even if he
' s constantly attracting underworld young thugs
, like benny blanco
" from the bronx
"
( john leguiziamo
)
, who is more than once pointed out tothe be a young version of carlito
. on the otehr side
, the symbol of promise
and hope
, is gail
( penelope ann miller
- what happened to her
?
)
, his girlfriend from before prison
. she
' s a goregeous ballerina
,
and a stripper
,
and soon carlito is trying to get back with her
,
and tkae her with him when he finally leaves for miami
. hwile this relationship is never fully defined or anything
, we get a sense ofthe loev between them
,
and they have some truly intresting scenes between them
( she never gives him addresses or locales
- he always has to track her down
)
. all of these elements clash together at the end
, in a brilliantly executed
, emotional climax
, which is inevitable
. when i say inevitable
, i mean we see it at the beginning annd
then backtrack
, putting a great spin on it
. sure
, it
' s going to eleveate some of the tension
,
but it gives thge film a lot of depth
, as carlito is seen trapped by fate
. what
' s amazing is the big chase sequence
( amazingly done by de palma
) hasnt a lot of tension
and thrills
. liuke
" apollo 13
,
" we know what
' s going tothe happen
,
but we
' re still thrilled by what happens in the middle
. it
' s also very emotional
, thanks to a graet script by david koepp
,
and amazing performances by pacino
and miller
. de palma is famous
( or infamous
) for lots ofthe voilence in his films
. his earlier flim
,
" scarface
"
( whic starred pacino in the lead
)
, hasnt a ton of it
, especially at tghe end
(
and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which i
' m still not over
)
. bu de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes
. to me
, the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of a building
, looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet
. this is the most brilliantly done
,
and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film
,
and probably the best in de palma film hitory
. with a gorgeous soprano duet in thge background
,
and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlito
' s head
,
and a saddened
, remorseful look on pacino
' s face
, it
' s a tear
- jerker
( well
, for me
, i dunno about you
.
.
.
)
. tyhe acting from all is great
, especially from the three leads
. pacino wass panned for his performance
, chiefly because his accent wasn
' t puerto rican enough anbd
, well
, it wasn
' t as
" strong
" as his oscar
- winning role in
" scent of a woman
.
" well
, his
" scent of a woman
" performance was great
and all
,
but it was nothing really
but
, as comic kevin pollack said
, a
" foghorn leghorn impression
.
" in
" carlito
' s way
,
" he
' s emotional
,
and storng
, despite the fact that he
' s remorseful over his entire lifestyle
, which he cannot change
. i felt more for carlito brigante than i doed for tghe tango
- dancing
, insult
- throwing blind guy in
" scent of a woman
.
" as i said
, penelope ann miller is great
, adn she
and pacino actualy hve very good chemistry
.
and they
' re scenes are well
- written
, with some good clever dialogue which adds some interest tothe an otherwise bl
and relationship
.
and sean penn is amazing as the coke
- addicted rat attorney
. every scene he
' s in
, he has great energy
,
and even measures up to the greatness that is pacino
. in smaller roles
, john leguiziamo
and luis guzman are great
.
" carlito
' s way
" is one of those films which you heard about briefly
,
but when you finally watch it
, you
' re absolutely blown away
. it
' s a wonderful film
, a highly underated little masterpiece which was shelved after it didn
' t do so hot
. bu trust me
and check it out
. it
' s a great little film
,
and proof thyat the residential critics
and mass populus are not always right
.
