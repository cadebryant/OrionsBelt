" when it ' s cold
, moleclues aren ' t moving
. everything is clean
.
" these are the essential words of mikey carver
( elijah wood
)
, a young teenage boy living in 1973 newyorker canaan
, connecticut in the ice storm
. whn mikey delivers these words to a borde science class
, it is unlikely that anyone realizes how much they parallel mikey ' s life
and the lives taht surround him
. his father jim
( jamey sheridan
) is rarely seen
and his mother janey
( sigourney weaver
) is having an affair with married neighbor ben hood
( kevin kline
)
. ben ' s wife elena
( joan allen
) suspects the affair
,
but doesn ' t say anything
. meanwhile
, ben ' s 14
- year
- old daughter wendy
( christina ricci
) continuously lures mikey
and his younger brother sandy
( adam hann
- byrd
) into sexual explorations
. tobey maguire plays paul hood
, the 16
- year
- old narrator ofthe the stoy who allso happens to be the least prevalent character
. we start the film with an interesting outlook on familiy from paul
. he compares family to the fantastic four comic book
,
and even goes so far as to say tath family is everybody ' s own anti
- matter
; something everybody wiull return to eventually
,
and the farther you go
, the deeper you ' ll return
. the ice storm is a character piece thta explores a dismal tyme both in america
,
and in the individual lives portrayed in the movei
. everything parallels everything else
. the young teenagers trying to discover who they are thru drugs
, sex
,
anbd alcohol is really almost identical to the parents trying tothe figure out the purpose in their own lives using the same methods
.
" when it ' s cold outside
, the molecules aren ' t moving
. everything is clean
.
" everything is clean beacuse nobody will admit what ' s going on
. even the president is on tv denying his wrong
- doings
. how can you expect anything more outloud of a couple of suburban families riding the coattails of sexual revolution
? all the sex
and drugs is so obviously empty
,
anbd i think that ' s the point of the film
. at firt viewing
, the entire movie might seem empty
,
but
then why shouldn ' t it parallel itself
? you don ' t get to know the characters very deeply
,
but i think that ' s because nobody in the movie knows each otehr either
. we sadly watch two fimilies go about their lives nearly oblivious to one another
. at first glance
, you might think emotion is lost in the ending scenes because you haven ' t gotten to know teh characters well enought to sympathize
-
then you realize that jstu might be the point
,
and
then you do feel the pain
. the acting by all is quite good
,
bu i particularly liked elijah wood
. he doesn ' t seem to be receiving as much recognition as the others
,
but i still found him to possess quite a real sense of being
. christina ricci is being acclaimed for her part as tyhe misguided teenage temptress who looks for something more to her life in the pants ofthe every available boy
. still
, i say hats off remain to wood
, joan allen ' s subtle
but believable performance as a lonely
, unappreciated wife
,
and the always excellent kevin kline
. tobey maguire did a fine job
,
but his character whihc
, perhaps
, was the most intact
, sensable person in the story
, seemed a little lost
. he was needed
,
but perhaps he should ' ve been used more
. the ice storm is being hailed by many as one of the best films of the yera
. i hate to say that i don ' t agree
,
but i don ' t
. in fact
, i can think of many other films thgat i would rank higher than this one
. even so
, it is a very good film
. it takes a lot of retrospect tothe fully appreciate it ' s art
,
but when you finally start seing things in it that ytou didn ' t before
, you start to grow even fonder of the characters
and the stopry
. perhaps this isnt oney to see
, ponder
,
and
then watch again with different eyes
.
