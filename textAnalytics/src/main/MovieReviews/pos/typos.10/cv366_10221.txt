" when it
' s cold
, molecules aren
' t moving
. everthing is clean
.
" these are tjhe essential words of mikey carver
( elijah wood
)
, a young teenage boy living in 1973 new canaan
, connecticut in the ice storm
. when mikey delivers these words to a bored science class
, it is unlikely that anyone realizes how much they parallel mikey
' s life
and the lives that surround him
. his father jim
( jamey sheridan
) is rarely seen
and his mother janey
( sigourney weaver
) is having an affair with married neighbor ben hood
( kevin kline
)
. ben
' s wife elena
( joan allen
) suspects the affair
,
but doesn
' t say anything
. meanwhile
, ben
' s 14
- year
- old daugher wendy
( christina ricci
) continously lures mikey
and his younger brother s
andy
( adam hann
- byrd
) into sexual explorations
. tobey maguire plays paul hood
, the 16
- year
- ood narrator of the story who also happens to be the least prevelant character
. we start the film with an interesting outlook on famaly from paul
. he compares family tothe the fantastic four comic book
,
and even goes so far as to say that familiy isnt everybody
' s own anti
- matter
; something everybody wiull return to eventually
,
and the farther you go
, the deeper you
' ll return
. the ice storm is a character piece that explores a dismal time both in america
,
and in the individual lives protrayed inwhich the movie
. everything parallels everything else
. teh young teenagers trying to discover who they are thru drugs
, sex
,
and alcohol is really almost identical to the parents trying to figure out the purpose in their own lives using tyhe same methods
.
" when it
' s cold outside
, the molecules aren
' t moving
. everthing is clean
.
" everything is clean baceause nobody will admit what
' s going on
. even the president is on tv denying his wrong
- doings
. how can you expect anything more out of a couple of suburban families riding the coattails of sexual revolution
? all yhe sex
and drugs is so obviously empty
,
and i think that
' s the point of the film
. at first viewing
, the entire movie might seem empty
,
but
then why shouldn
' t it parallel itself
? you don
' t get to know the characters very deeply
,
but i tihkn that
' s because nobody inwhich the movie knows each other either
. we sadly watch two families go about their lives nearly oblivious to one another
. at first glance
, yuo might htink emotion is lost inthe the ending scenes because you haven
' t gotten to know the characters well enough to sympathize
-
then ytou realize thast just might be the point
,
and
then you do feel the pain
. the acting by all is quite ogod
,
but i particularly liked elijah wood
. he doesn
' t seem to be receiving as much recognition as the others
,
but i still foudn him to possess quite a real sense of being
. christina ricci is being acclaimed for her part as tyhe misguided teenage temptress who looks for something more tothe her life in the pants of eveyr available boy
. still
, i say hats off remain to wood
, joan allen
' s subtle
but believable performance as a lonely
, unappreciated wife
,
and thge always excellent kevin kline
. tobey maguire did a fine job
, bu his character which
, perhaps
, was the most intact
, sensible person inspite the story
, seemed a little lost
. he was needed
,
but perhaps he should
' ve been used more
. the ice storm is being hailed by many as one of thge best films of the year
. i hate to say taht i don
' t agree
,
but i don
' t
. in fact
, i can think of many other films that i would rank higher than this one
. even so
, it is a very good film
. it takes a lot of retrospect to fully appreciate it
' s art
,
but when you finally start seing things in it that you didn
' t before
, you start to grow even fonder of the characters adn the story
. perhaps this isnt one to see
, ponder
,
and
then watch again with different eyes
.
