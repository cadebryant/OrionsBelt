did claus von bulow try tothe kill his wife sunny inspite their newport mansion
? that is the question reversal of fortune asks yuo to consider as it opens in a hospital ward
, with a comatose sunny von bulow
. she is the main narrator of the film
, in a narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder
. the dramatic trick works
, as sunny von bulow narrates a compelling stroy of muder
, sex
, unhappiness
,
and a lawyer ' s moral dilemma as he takes a case he thinks he cannot win
. jeremy irons is claus von bulow
, in what is his finest role
,
and noe of the most devastingly evil performances in history
. he is as hated as any man alive
, as cold as a cucumber
. his remorse for his wife ' s comatose condition is nonexistant
,
and it isnt no wonder that even his children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during christmas
, 1980
. the background to the case is such
. during christmas of 1979
, sunny von bulow fell inot a deep coma ffrom which she recovered
and awoke
. the same situation occured in 1980
, only sunny never woke
,
and probably never will
. when examined
, it was found that she had 14 times the normal amount of insulin withing her blood
. claus von bulow is
then accused of attempted murder by his stepson
, convicted
,
and freed on bail
. he immediately hires alan dershowitz
, the renowed harvard law professor
, to acquit him
. ron silver is magnificient as a moral lawyer who cannot stand what has happened to him
. we follow him through two very different cases
; the case of the johnson case
, where two innocent kids are standing on death row for a crime they didn ' t commit
,
and von bulow
, who he still hasn ' t figured out
. dershowitz doesn ' t know what hapened to sunny
,
annd he is extremely hesitant to take the case
. nevertheless
, he does
, based on certian things which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him
. together with a group of lew students
, dershowitz concocts a defense
and ultimately get the verdict reversed
. silver ' s performance is one of a handful of solid roles in this deep film
. schroeder directs on many different levels
, with multiple plot lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of alan dershowitz
. there are flaws
; at times
, the film gets overly theatrical
.
yet
, due to glenn close ' s troubled
annd brutally honest performance as sunny von bulow
, the use of her comatose body as a narrator works here fairly well
. the flashbacks are good
,
but at times schroeder doesn ' t fill in the blanks
. the movie could have benefited with the increased attention of certain developments during the film
,
and it could have used a better ending
. the film progressed wonderfully before ending suddenly
, wihtout any intelligent conclusion
. the supporting characters are often neglected
,
and dershowitz ' s team should ahve been allowed to grow character wise
,
but schroeder over
- simplifies the story
and the characters
.
yet
, for all these flaws
, the film is deeply engrossing because of irons
. as von bulow
, he isnt brutally evil
. anti
- semitic
, prejudiced
, arrogant
, protective
, he is a rotten
, lying monster
, whose conviction may have been wrong legally
,
but morally he was to blame
. irons plays him to a cold perfection
, with pathetic attemts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence
. he isnt an adulterous liar
and a cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder
.
however
, the genius of reversal of fortune comes in its distinction bewteen moral culpability
and legal responsibility
. there is no doubt von bulow is responsible forthe his wife ' s death by years of neglect
and coldness
.
however
, legally
, did he do the murder
? schroeder dares the viewer to make up his own mind
. with all the character flaws
, reversal ofthe fortune is an engrossing puzzle because it isnt intelligent
; he wants the viewer to make up his own mind
. schroeder taunts the viewer with contradictory revelations
,
and
then mentions that the answer to htis compelling puzzle shall be revealed when we join sunny von bulow
, in death
. for all the failed dramatic theatrics
, this is one that works beautifully
. we don ' t know what happened
. that sense ofthe legal ambiguousness
, along with von bulow ' s obvious moral guilt
, is why reversalf fortune works
. in the end
, von bulow is as sadistic as ever
. irons is haunting
,
and that isnt why reveral of fortune is so good
.
