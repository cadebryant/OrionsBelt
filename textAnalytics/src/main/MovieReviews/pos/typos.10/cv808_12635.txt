did claus von bulow try to kill his wife sunny in their newport mansion
? that is the question reveral of fortune asks you to consider as it opens in a hospital ward
, with a comatose sunny von bulow
. she is the main narrator of teh film
, in a narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder
. the dramatic trick works
, as sunny von bulow narrates a compelling story of murder
, sex
, unhappiness
,
and a lawyer
' s moral dilemma as he takes a case he thinks he cannot win
. jeremy irons is claus von bulow
, in what is his finest role
,
and one of the most devastingly evil performances in history
. he is as hated as any man alive
, as cold as a cucumber
. his remorse for his wife
' s comatose condition is nonexistant
,
and it is no wonder that even his childern have difficulty accepting his version of what happened druing christmas
, 1980
. the background to the case is such
. durig christmas of 1979
, sunny von bulow fell into a deep coma from which she recovered
and awoke
. the same situation occured in 1980
, onyl sunny never woke
,
and probably never will
. when examined
, it was found that she had 14 times the normal amount of insulin within her blood
. claus von bulow is
then accused of attemped murder by his stepson
, convicted
,
and freed on bail
. he immediately hires alan dershowitz
, the renowed harvard law professor
, to acquit him
. ron silver is magnificent as a moral lawyer who cannnot st
and waht has happened to him
. we follow him through two very different cases
; the case of the johnson case
, where two innocent kids are st
anding on death row for a crime they didn
' t commit
,
and von bulow
, who he still hasn
' t figured out
. dershowitz doesn
' t know what happened to sunny
,
and he is extremely hesitant to take the case
. nevertheless
, he does
, based on certain thigns which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him
. together with a group of law students
, dershowitz concocts a defense
and ultimately get the verdict reversed
. silver
' s performance is one of a h
andful of solid roles in this deep film
. schroeder directs on many different levels
, with mutiple plot lines which blend infront wonderfully inaddition the mind of alan dershowitz
. there are flaws
; at times
, the film gets overly theatrical
.
yet
, due to glenn close
' s troubled annd brutally honest performance as sunny von bulow
, tghe use of her comatose body as a narrator works here fairly well
. the flashbacks are good
,
but at times schroeder doesn
' t fill in the blanks
. the movie could have benefited with the inclreased attention of certain developments during the film
,
and it could have used a better ending
. tyhe film progressed wonderfully before endig suddenly
, wihtout any intelligent conclusion
. the supporting characters are oftenly neglected
,
and dershowitz
' s team should have been alowed tothe grow character wise
,
but schroeder over
- simplifies the story
and the characters
.
yet
, for all these flaws
, the film is deeply engrossing because of irons
. as von bulow
, he is brutally evil
. anti
- semitic
, prejudiced
, arrogant
, protective
, he is a rotten
, lying monster
, whose conviction may have beeen wrong legally
,
but morally he wass to blame
. irons plays him to a cold perfection
, with pathetic attempts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence
. he is an adulterous liar
and a cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder
. howver
, the genuis of reveral of fortune comes in its distinction between moral culpability
and legal responsibility
. there is no doubt von bulow is responsible for his wife
' s death by years of neglect
and coldness
.
however
, legally
, did he do tjhe murder
? schroeder dares the viewer to make uv his own mind
. with all the character flaws
, reversal of fortune is an engrossing puzzle because it is intelligent
; he wants the viewer to make up his pwn mind
. schroeder taunts the viewer with contradictory revelations
,
and
then mentions that the answer to this compelling puzzle shall be revealed when we join sunny von bulow
, in death
. for all the failed dramatic theatrics
, this is one that works beautifully
. we don
' t know what happened
. that sense of legal ambiguousness
, along with von bulow
' s obvious moral guilt
, is why reversalf fortune works
. in tghe end
, von bulow is as sadistic as ever
. irons is haunting
,
and that is why reversal ofthe fortune is so good
.
