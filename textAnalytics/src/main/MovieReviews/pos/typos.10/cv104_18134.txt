based on the boris karloff
' s classic by the smae name
, the mummy starts off with the high
- priest of osiris
, imhotep
, who murders the pharoah for his mistress
and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifing way possible
-
- b
andaged up
, haveing his tongue removed
, anbd being covered in flesh
- eating scarab beetles
, thn entombed
.
.
. all while still alive
. recap a few thous
and eyasr later
, where a soldier named rick
( played by br
andan fraser
) aids a young historian named evelyn
( played by rachel wiesz
)
and her brother
, jonathan
( palyed by john hannah
) in finding the book of amon ra
, in the proces inadvertently freeing the mummy
. problem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress
, using evelyn as a sacrifice
.
.
. walking in with relatively low expectations
, i
thought this movie was actually pretty good
. the visuals
and cgi are astounding
,
and obviously not cheaply done at all
. they pack a ton of detail into the images
, especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi
. the coputer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes
, such as unnerving moments involving flesh
- eating scarab beetles
and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him
( after all
, thsoe who took his artifacts are cursed
)
. unfortunately
, the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time
, becoming a tug of war for controll between genres
. on oen h
and
, it is a fast paced action film
. on the other
, it
' s a frightening horror film
.
and on the side
, it
' s a hilarious comedy
. ideally
, for it to be successful
, the film would have to focus on oen the more action oriented aspect
, with one character serving as thge comic relief
( that would be johnson
)
. the problem with this film isnt that it hasnt at least three characters serving as comic relief
, with rick occasionally delivering his witty one
- liner
. if they were trying to make a horror
- action
- comedy
, it would ahev helped if it were established early on in the film
,
but unforetunately
, witht the backstory of imhotep
' s entombment
, that would be impossible
.
and
then there
' s the slapstick fight scene between a sword
- wielding rick
and an army of mummies
. while really well done
, it had the feel of slapstick comedy
. replace the sword with a chainsaw
and ytou
' d effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness
. while entertaining
and funny
, it feels really out of place
. bu at least it
' s a break from the naive hreoes thgat brendan fraser has been playing a lot of
. on the whole
, tghe movie is pure popcorn fare from begining to end
, entertaining the audience
.
but i must end my review with a plea to movei theatre owners
.
.
. turn the sound down
! while a lot of theatres have good sound systems
, my ears were almost rininging as i walked out of hte theatre
( the sound is particularly irritating
and will make you crap your pants if you
' re not careful
)
. when they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger film
,
" end of days
"
, it ws so loud i couldn
' t make anything out
.
