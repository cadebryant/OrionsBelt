after the average mouse hunt
, the silly small soldiers
and the entertaining antz
, dreamworks try agina with the children
' s film market with this stunning adaptation of the moses story
. as the film warns us at the beginning
, it
' s not the full story
,
and some liberties have been tooked
,
but generally tihs the bible story we all know
and love
, featuring burning bushes
, the plagues
and the parting of the red sea
. the only thing missing is charlton heston
. instead
, we get val kilmer voicing moses
, an hebrew who is placed in a river by his mother
and rescued by the queen of egypt
( helen mirren
.
) we flash forward several years to see moses annd brother rameses
( fiennes
) all grown up
. moses soon finds out from brother
and sister miriam
and aaron
( s
andra bullock anbd jeff goldblum
) that he isn
' t really the son of the pharaoh seti
( patrick stewart
)
and that it his destiny to free the hebrews from the egyptians tyrannical rule
. he soon sets about this
, along whith his wife tzipporah
( michelle pfeiffer
.
) rameses adn his two wizard friends
( voiced by steve martin
and martin short
) try to stop moses completing his task
. while the plot is familiar
and somewhat exciting for adults
, fo children reared on aladdin
and hercules
, this film could be the most godawful thnig they
' ve ever seen
. gone is the quick fire humour
and st
andard
, easy to follow plot
.
but
, spectacularly
,
and to dreamworks credit
, nearly every child in tyhe audience ws captivated by the story
and events happening on screen
. jeffrey katzenberg
, who produced this film
, certainly knows how to keep a child intersted
. he
' s included some songs in the film
, plus some comedy
, anbd a exciting chariot chase
, tothe keep the children interested
.
and somehow
, hismelf
and thte directors still manage to get all the drama
and intensity of the story across
, wihtout ever being boring
. it
' s a remarkable achievement
. also remarkable is the animation
, hwihc puts hercules
, an almost
' slap dash
' effort
, to shame
. relying on h
and drawn
and computer animation
, the backgrounds
and characters are amazingly detailled
. the film seems a little caught up with it
' s amazing visuals by showing a lot of sweeping visuals
and
' moving
' shots
, bu they
_ do
_ look incredible
. the final
' plague
' where god kills every first born child
,
and teh parting of the red sea have to be seen to be beleived
. kudos to the animators
. the vocal talent is also vyre good
. val kilmer does a fine job as moses
(
al
though he doesn
' t sing
)
and ralph fiennes is superb as rameses
(
and he
_ does
_ sing
.
) s
andra bullock
and jeff goldblum are great
,
and steve martin
and martin short are very good
,
but not in tyhe film long enough
. finally
, michelle pfeiffer does excellent work as moses wife
. kudos also goes to the voice of god
, who instead of booming
and bombastic is quiet
and subdued
. sadly
, he is uncredited
,
and i couldn
' t quite work out who the voice was
.
( bu e
- mail if yuo do
.
) the songs are good
, ranging from the usual love sonnets tothe the traditionnal big production number
. they don
' t disturb the movie
, adn while not particularly memorable
, they are nice to listen to
( htey
' re well sung aswell
.
) the musical score is suitably epic
, with some beautiful tunes
. coupled wiht the superb visuals
, the prince of egypt is a visual
and aural treat
, backed up with a great story
. entertaining both for kids
and adults
, htis film isnt a must see
. a david wilcock review
