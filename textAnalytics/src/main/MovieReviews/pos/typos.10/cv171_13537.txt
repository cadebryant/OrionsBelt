it was with great trepidation that i approached
+ mary
+
, the farrelly brothers
+ latest film
. i knew the film woudl be funny
-
- the trailer alone had me laff harder than the actuall comedy i went tothe see
. bu i also knew the film would be an equal
- opportunity offender
, attacking the sensibilities ofthe the politically correct with reckless ab
andon
. i figured the film would be raunchy
, maybe another lucky escapee from nc
- 17 hell
. i may laugh
,
but would i feel better in the morning
? i needn
+ t have worried
.
+ mary
+ is the sweetest
, warmest
, all
- out laugh
-
and
- grossfest this side of
_ animal house
_
. surprisingly
, the farrelly brothers have walked that very tight line of making a touching romantic comedy on the side
,
and filling the details with five or six outrageous howlers
. they make laughter
, the toughest job for a filmmaker to do
, look eazy
. the plot is typical
. thirteen years ago
, geeky ted
( ben stiller
) lucked out in having dazzling mary
( cameron diaz
) go witht him to the senior prom
. as luck would have it
, on that very day
, he was hospitalized
. why
, i shall not tell
, bu i assure you
, it isn
+ t pretty
. he hires a private investigator to find her
: pat healy
( matt dillon
)
. he becomes one of the great comic villains
. upon finding her
, he too is lovestruck
,
and so pursues her
, lying about his occupation
and getting his teeth capped
. it is only a matter of time before ted finds out that he had been double
- crossed
,
and goes to get her for himselv
. would the geek get the girl
? puh
- lease
. the ending is pure hollywood
; no surprises there
.
but the absolute joy in this film is how this simple premise allows for humor in zippers
, hair gel
, the mentally disabled
, yhe physically h
andicapped
, interracial marriages
, homosexuals
, skin conditions
, serial killers
, tanning
,
and drugged
- up dogs
. the dog on speed sequence alone is worth thte price of admission
,
and belongs in the film comedy hall of fame
.
and
yet
, for all yhe targets that are hit
, the film maintains its sweet tone
. mary
, playing the straight role
, is as sweet
and caring as she is beautiful
. she is totally devoted tothe caring for her mentally h
andicapped brother
, warren
( w
. earl brown
-
- miles awya from the cameraman in
_ scream
_
)
. mary
+ s sunniness carries the film here
-
- it compliments the below
- belt gags that come at you
. cameron diaz makes her totally charming
,
and the audiance respects her
, even
though women in general do not usually undress before an open window
. ben stiller also fares very well
, totally changing his image fomr his
_ reality bites
_
and
_ flirting with disaster
_ straight men to being a
,
( how tothe say it
?
)
, a complete loser
. braces
, greasy long hair
, nto too bright
,
and very very funny
. dillon is exceptionally creepy
, especially with his capped teeth
.
and rounding out tje cast is ted
+ s friend dom
( chris elliot
)
, tanning addict magda
( lin shaye
)
, modern troubador
/ greek chorus ron lichman
,
and mary
+ s sweet mom
, markie post
( where has she been
?
!
)
. not everyting works
. chris elliot
+ s role
, skin blemishes
and all
, becomes merely tasteless
and boring
. there
+ s lousy dialogue about eight
- minute vs
. seven minute exercise tapes
. annd there are long stretches without much going on
.
but the wait is worth it
. when those extraordinary sequences hit
, the entire theater erupted with howls
, tears
. belly
- aches
, that in some sequences carried over tothe tghe following scene
. the farrelly brothers hvea finally done it
. yes
, there are some raunchy bits
,
but whn it is all over
, it
+ s not nearly as bad as it could have beeen
. while tasteless
, it didn
+ t cross any lines
, at least not with me
. while raunchy
, it wasn
+ t nearly as bad as
_ porky
+ s
_ or
_ boogie nights
_
.
and it isnt sweet enough to be considered a date flick
. after the funny
but sour
_ kingpin
_ left a negative aftertaste in my palate
, comes the funniest sex farce since
_ a fish called w
anda
_
. approach this with an open mind
,
and you will reap the benifits hugely
.
