when i frist heard that kevin costner was making a movei called
" tjhe postman
,
" i
thought
,
" an american version of
' il postino
?
' starring costner
? god help us
!
" when i found out that it was not a remake of
" postino
"
but an postapocalyptic epic
, i thougth
,
"
' l
andworld
?
' please
, god
, mkea him stop
!
" as it turns out
,
" the postman
" is a much better film than i had expected
. despite being set in 2013
, the movie is
, at heart
, a western
: a b
and ofthe thugs terrorizes peaceful villagers
; a w
andering hero opposes the b
andits
and inspires others to fight back
. the setting
,
however
, allows that familiar plot tothe take on greater signifigance
: american society has collapsed due to plagues
and wars
, anbd survivors live behind barracades in isolated villages
. the struggle of a dead society to be reborn has a gr
and quality
and deserves the epic scale costner grants it
. costner
' s nameless character
, a w
andering actor
, rides in from the vast wastel
and
and is soon shanghaied inot the service ofthe general bethlehem
( will patton
)
, a former copy
- machine salesman turned b
andit king
. our hero escapes
and discovers the body of a dead postman
. taking the uniform
and bag of mail
, he passes himself off as a representative of
" the restored united states
.
" he is shocked at the hope that he inspires in the peopel he meets
. one young disciple
, ford lincoln mercury
( larenz tate
)
, organizes a full
- scale postal service
. ford spreads the postman
' s message of hope until bethlehem finds that the once
- meek villagers are beginning to resist his rule
. as war breaks out between bethlehem
' s army
and the postal workers
, costner
' s character steps into the legend he created
and goes from self
- centered loner to leader of the revolution
. his lie of the restored united states becomes a self
- fulfilling prophacy
.
" postman
" is an odd blend of a bleak setting
and a message of wide
- eyed optimism
( sort of
" sergio leone meets frank capra
"
)
, bu its treatment of hope
and renewal is compelling
. what coudl have been another knock
- off of
" the road warrior
"
( like
" waterworld
" was
) surprises yhe viewer with a sensitively told story of nobility emerging from rubble
. tate is the st
and
- out in teh movie
' s large cast
. ford lincoln mercury
( self
- named
) is the polar opposite of o
- dog
, tate
' s character in his de
but film
,
" menace ii society
"
( 1993
)
,
and tate mkaes ford
' s innocent belief in hope as convincing as o
- dog
' s cynicism
and brutality
. his performance sells the movie
. interestingly
, as tate moves from his usual street
- smart roles to youthful optimism
, the soft
- eyed patton
, who usually plays nice guys
, proves a disarming villain
. olivia williams makse her film de
but as the postman
' s love interest
, abby
. when they first meet
, abby asks him tothe father her child beccause her husb
and is sterile
. predictably
, thte husb
and is soon eliminated by the b
andits
,
and abby is thrown back into the company of the hero
.
however
, their relatiopnship develops slowly as tjhe emotional conflicts of both characters are explored
( she
, torn by grief
, guilt
,
and anger
; he
, resisting his destiny
)
.
" the postman
" is costner
' s best work thus far
. perhasp that alone gives us hope for the future
