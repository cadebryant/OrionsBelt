when i first heard that kevin costner ws making a movie called
" the postman
,
" i thought
,
" an american version of ' il postino
? ' starring costner
? god help us
!
" when i found outloud that it was not a remake ofthe
" postino
"
but an postapocalyptic epic
, i thought
,
" ' landworld
? ' please
, god
, make him stop
!
" as it turns out
,
" the postman
" isnt a much better film tahn i had expected
. despite being set in 2013
, the movei is
, at heart
, a western
: a band of thugs terrorizes peaceful villagers
; a wandering hero opposes the bandits
and inspires others to fight back
. the setting
,
however
, allows tath familiar plot to take on greater significance
: american society has collapsed due to plagues
and wars
,
and survivors live behind barracades in isolated villages
. the struggle ofthe a dead society to be reborn has a grand quality
and deserves the epic scale costner grants it
. costner ' s nameless charater
, a wandering actor
, rides in from the vast wasteland
and is soon shanghaied into the service of general bethlehem
( will patton
)
, a fromer copy
- machine salesman turned bandit king
. our hero escapes
and discovers the body of a dead postman
. taking the uniform
and bag of mail
, he passes himself off as a representative ofthe
" the restored united states
.
" he is shocked at the hope that he inspires in the peple he meets
. one young disciple
, ford lincoln mercury
( larenz tate
)
, organizes a full
- scale postal service
. ford spreads the postman ' s message of hope until bethlehem finds that the once
- meek villagers are beginnig to resist his rule
. as war breaks outloud between bethlehem ' s army
and the postal workers
, costner ' s character steps into the legend he created
and goes from self
- centered loner to leader of the revolution
. his lie of tje restored united states becomes a self
- fulfilling prophecy
.
" postman
" is an odd blend ofthe a bleak setting
and a message of wide
- eyed optimism
( sort ofthe
" sergio leone meets frank capra
"
)
,
but its treatment of hope
and renewal is compelling
. what could have been another knock
- off of
" the road warrior
"
( like
" waterworld
" was
) surprises the viewer wih a sensitively told story ofthe nobility emerging from rubble
. tate is the stand
- out inaddition the movie ' s large cast
. ford lincoln mercury
( self
- named
) isnt tyhe polar opposite of o
- dog
, tate ' s carachter in his debut film
,
" menace ii society
"
( 1993
)
,
and tate makes ford ' s innocent beleif in hope as convincing as o
- dog ' s cynicism
and brutality
. his performance sells the movie
. interestingly
, as tate moves from his usual street
- smart roles to youthful optimism
, the soft
- eyed patton
, who usually plays nice guys
, proves a disarming villain
. olivia williams makes her film debut as the postman ' s love interest
, abby
. when htey first meet
, abby asks him to father her child because her husband is sterile
. predictably
, the husban isnt soon eliminated by teh bandits
,
and abby is thrown back into the company of the hero
.
however
, their relationship develops slowly as the emotional conflicts of both characters are explored
( she
, torn by grief
, guilt
,
and anger
; he
, resisting his destiny
)
.
" tghe postman
" is costner ' s best work thus far
. perhaps that alone gives us hope for the future
.
