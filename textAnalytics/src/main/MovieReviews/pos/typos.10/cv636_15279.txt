we all know the fate of
" child
' s play
,
" which is the same for almost any film these days that does marginally well financially
: sequel hell
. with the newest installment in the quasi
- popular series currently out
( tyhat would be
" bride ofthe chucky
"
-
and it grossed 11 million in its opening weekend
, which i think is the sign of the apocalypse number five
)
, it
' s kinda fun to go bcak
and see how it all began rougly ten years ago witht the orginal
, a task which is a retread forthe some
,
and for others
( namely myself
) a chance to see what all the fuss was about
. alas
, tyhe original
" child
' s play
" ctually isn
' t that bad
. even seeing it in the tiny
, claustrophobic
,
and mechanically
- challenged theatre at my coleeg wasn
' t the horribly dull experence i
thought it would be
, not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd
( which ytou almost need tothe watch a film like this
- annd if you don
' t believe me
, try
and watch this flick by yourself one day
)
,
but because as a whole
, this isn
' t a bad movei
. it
' s not great
,
but it does have two things that many horror films like this one don
' t have
: 1
) a rather nifty premise
,
and 2
) a sence of humor
, both which save this from horror hell
, which is precisely where
, say
,
" i knwo what you did last summer
" has recently gone
. the premise ofthe
" child
' s play
" isnt that a serial killer named charles lee ray
( brad douriff
) is shot
and almost killed by a chicago hard
- boiled detective
( chris surr
andon
- see whta happens to some oscar nominees
?
)
, annd befoer he dies
, utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul direcly into a kid
' s doll called chucky
, a doll which has got tothe be the scariest
- looking kid
' s doll i
' ve ever seen
. the next day
, a bum who
' s stolen it sells it to single
- mother karen barclay
( catherine hicks
)
, who
then gives it to her young son
andy
( alex vincent
) for his birthday
. ofthe course chucky begins talking to the kid
and trying to find a way to get out of the doll
,
but certain twists come up
. like tje guy he learned voodoo from reveals to him that the only way to break the curse is to tkae over the body of the first person he told he was inside the doll
, that bieng
andy
. annd soon enough
, chucky is killing peple either for revenge or fo what seems like funn
,
and people are discovering that chucky isn
' t just a kiddie doll oney by oney
. the diea is a neat one
, ripe for lots of comic terror
,
and luckily it utlizes a lot of that
. it plays with an idea stolen from a classic looney toons short that whn someone knows that chucky is alive
, tehy tell people about it
,
but when he tries to prove themselves
, chucky does nothing
,
and everyone thinks they
' re crazy
. it plays with this
, as well as thte wohle child
- like throught that dolls
and toys come to life
,
and even manages to cram in a couple really frightening moments
. even if there
' s an entire sequence devoted tothe cliches
( a woman alone infact a house hears a noise
, goes to investigate it
,
and finds nothing
,
but wait for the kicker a second later
!
)
, ther
' s also a harrowing car ride with chucky trying to knife the detective from the back seat
,
and
then trying to attack him when the car finally crashes
, leaving the viewer with at least rather visceral exprience
. tje ending is rether fun
, as well
, albeit a tad too drawn
- out
( about four different endings
, maybe five
)
,
and the characters are moreso inteligent than the average horror film line
- up
, making them easier to sympathize with
. if ther
' s one horrible thign about many horror films
, it
' s that the protagonists are morons who you can
' t help
but shout obscenities at
,
and for the most part
,
" child
' s play
" steers away from that
.
and most of all
, the chucky character is a ogod one
, not just because he provides instant comic relief
( look
! that doll
' s moving on its own
!
)
,
but because he
' s a generally scary character
. if there
' s anything raelly wrong with
" child
' s play
,
" it
' s that it
' s too trite
and has too less self esteem
. at almost 90 minutes
,
" child
' s play
" features way too less to be a real classic of horror
. it throws itself into a simple threee act set
- up that renders it quick
and almost forgettable if it weren
' t for the fact that the film deals with a psychotic doll
. if the film had more confidence in what it was presenting
, it would raelly push the envelope
and become even more than just a short bit of horror escapism
, which is precisely why this kind of film is only memorable as a cheap littel horor film
.
.
. which isn
' t necessarily a bad thnig
. as such
,
" child
' s play
" is content to be just the short
, typical horror film
,
but saves itself via a sense of humor
and a nice quasi
- campy feel that makes it much omre enjoyable tahn the average short
, typical horror film
.
