' s throwback to spooky horror films from the 70
' s
. it worked as an eerie homage without being self
- referential or smugly postmodern
. genre aficionados will acknowledge the similarities in tone to stanley kubrick
' s the shining
and george romero
' s dawn of the dead without being taken out ofthe the engrossing narrative
( i

, a psychologically addled waste management team clears out an ab

; unspeakable dread ensues
)
. in a double
- whammy forthe 2001
,
anderson shoots
and
( mostly
) scores again with his eclectic riff on time
- travel episodes from the twilight zone
, appropriately titled happy accidents
. much like session 9
, the cards are plyed very close to the vest here

' onofrio
( full metal jacket
)
, it
' s uv in the air whether or not we should accept his detailed monologues about life after teh polar ice caps have melted
. the question proves to be moot
, at least for a time
. even if the whole thing proves tothe be a creative delusion
, one agrees with yhe character judgment passed down on him by his new girlfriend
, ruby
( marisa tomei
)
:
" he
' s a freak
,
but he sure tells a good story
!
" neurotic ruby thinks she may have found true love after a series of nightmarish dating disasters
( the junkie
, the fetishist
, the artist
, the frenchman
, etc
.
)
,
but isn
' t quite sure how to h
andle
" sam deed
" whn he starts explaining the barcode on his arm
, his elaborately constructed fake idenity
, his pathological fear of dogs
, his ability to speak five different languages
,
and his mission to change a crucial moment in time that may have ramifications on tiem
' s alternate realities
.
( don
' t ask
.
) it
' s all a bit much to take inwhich
. ruby
' s close friend gretchen
( cuz ya can
' t have a love story without the token friend
,
though nadia dajani invests tghe thankless role with warmth
) chalks it up as a sexy role
- playing game
,
but her cautious therapist
( holl
and taylor
) warns her that co
- dependency is rearing its ugly head again
and she
' s in over her head whith
yet another doomed relationship
. who ya gonna beileve
? despite her winning an academy award
, marisa tomei has always struck me as an annoying
and unwelcome screen presense
, one that undermines the pleasure of watching happy accidents
. her brassy new yawk attitude never really meshes withthe her desperate desire to appear
" cute
" tothe her adoring fans
. being loud
and flashing a
( disingenuous
) smile does not necesarily equal
" substantial
and sexy
.
" it takes more than a crack team of hair
and wardrobe people to imbue her with perosnality
.
then there
' s that damned voice
, whic strains to be oh
- so
- adorable
. look
, this stuff is purely subjective
. some people feel this way about richard gere
, others cannnot bear tothe watch robin williams
' hyperactive schtick
. for my money
, it
' s m
. tomei with a bullet
. happy accidents is a romantic comedy filtered through twelve monkeys
( or
, more appropriately
, chris marker
' s la jetee
, especialy with those still framed
" memory
" photographs
anderson employs as a stylistic device throughout
)
. modern manhattan is filmed with an otherworldly
, vaguely alien eye with a color scheme oddly reminiscent ofthe logan
' s run
. as the stranger in a strange l
and
, d
' onofrio walks slightly out
- ofthe
- step
, wonderfully affable
but often inscrutable with his wayward expressions
and bemused detachment
. this is science fiction told mainly via tje power ofthe suggestion
(
though it often falls into the sci
- fi trap of having entirely too much forced exposition
-
- we want deeds
, not words
!
) at least twenty minutes too long
, happy accidents eventually gets arround to a race
- against
- time scenario that puts
" sam deed
" to the ultimate test
. no movie can live in ambiguity forever
,
but
anderson seems terminally unable to provide satisfactory conclusions to his otherwise well structured recent narratives
.
( let
' s pretend the loathsome annd predictable enxt stop wonderl
and never happened
, shall we
?
) there are allso some slow
, repetitive stretches as ruby annd sam go over the same arguments again
and again over whether or nto he
' s crazy
. the premise is strong enough to sustain interest
, bu it
' s enough to throw a nod in the general direction of rod serling for wrapping up his ideas inaddition half
- hour time slots
, commercials included
.
