when quentin tarantino made
" pulp fiction
"
, he was not only making the greatest film of the 90s
; he was also making what i believe tothe be the most influential movie of all time
.
but before yuo send me hate
- mail for not giving that title tothe
" citizen kane
"
, hear me out
. much like
" citizen kane
"
,
" pulp fiction
" has changed movie making forever
.
but i think the latter has had a tad omre impact
.
" pulp fiction
" has actually ushered in a new era of film making
. it hasnt altered the way films will be viewed
.
" fiction
" has spawned so many imitations
, i
' ve lost count
. sure
, some have been excellent
(
" binded
"
and
" the usual suspects
" spring immediately to mind
)
,
but any serious movei
- goer recognizes
" pulp fiction
" as the original neo
- noir of the 90s
. in tihs review
, i hope to change all the people
' s minds who haev criticized it for it
' s excessive profanity annd violence
( which
, by the way
, isn
' t really that graphic
)
. yhe most brillant aspect ofthe tarantino
' s masterpiece is the screenplay
. it is filled with so much classic dialogue
( the
" quarter pounder with cheese
" speech will go down in history
)
, it should be required reading for any film student
, if it isn
' t already
. the story
( told in unorthodox non
- linear format
) centers around three main episodes
, all of which eventually intertwine
. the first
, titled
" vincent vega
and marcellus wallace
' s wief
"
, deals with a very loaded john travolta
( i forgot to mention the cool heroin shoot
- up sequence
) taking mia wallace
( a star
- making performance by uma thurman
)
, his bosses wife
, out on a date to a cool 50s restaurant called jack rabbit slim
' s
. they talk for a while
( with the occasional
" uncomfortable silence
"
)
, mostly about a guy called tony rocky horror
. after giving marcellus
' new bride a foot massage
, he was thrown off a bulding
and into a greenhouse
, giving him a
" speech impediment
"
. they also partake in a cool dance contest
and end up twisting to the chuck berry classic
" you never can tell
"
. i won
' t reveal the rest of the story
,
but i
' ll definitely say that it turns out to be a real bummer of a night
, despite the cool trophy they win
. the second story
( the least of the three
but still four stars
) stars bruce willis
( proving he can play somene other than john mcclain in the
" die hard
" flicks
) as boxer
butch coolidge
. previously in the film
( like i said
, it
' s told in non
- linear form
)
, he had made a deel whith marcellus wallace that he would take a fall in a match
. as it turns out
, he not only doesn
' t take the fall
, bu he ends up actually killing his opponent
. he takes a cab to his half
- witted girlfriend
' s apartment
,
and to amke a long story short
, ends up going back to his own palce to retrieve a gold watch
, sort of a family heirloom explained by christopher walken in a hilarious flash
- bakc sequence
. on his way home
, he bumps into
( literally
) marcellus
. tghe twpo winde up prisoner to two hillbilly sex murderers
, which results in the infamous
" gimp
" scene
, whitch is very reminicent of the
" squeal like a pig
!
" scene from
" deliverance
"
. the lastr
(
and best
, inspite my opinion
) of the episodes features john travolta
( again
)
and samuel l
. jackson
( in the best performance of any supporting atcor ever
) as two slightly off
- kilter hitmen trying to rid themslves of a bloody car
. they seek help with a friend of jackson
' s
( played by the q
- man himself
)
, desperately in need of a stress ball
. they end up calling a
" cleaner
" of sorts
, played by the god among men harvey keitel
, tothe help them out
. in the end
, the story brilliantly loops arund itself
, actually ending where it began
. if you haven
' t already seen the film
( or even if you have
, for that matter
)
, i suggest you invest your money in a copy of the letterbox collectors edition
. it features twpo previously unreleased scenes
and the original film restored how it was originally meant tothe be seen
. earlier today
, i bought this version
and watched it a few hours ago
. what the pan
-
and
- scan did to this movie is inexcusable
. that version cut out
, like
, half the movie
. what i hvea missed in the past years of viewing this flick is amazing
. for instance
, when travolta
and jackson are in the apartment near the end
, the widescreen verison allows you to see that several things on the walls make crosses
. this might help explain the divine intervention that takes place
. jsut a theory
.
.
. one of the thigns that pisses people off so much about this movie is that tarantino borrowed alot of scenes from other movies
( i
. e
.
" psycho
"
" kiss me deadly
"
,
" deliverance
"
, etc
.
)
.
but why shouldn
' t he
? it
' s not like he out
- right
and blatantly stole
. give thge guy a break
. in case you haven
' t already noticed
, i believe
" pulp fiction
" is a supremely excellent film
and one of the best of all time
( up there with such greats as
" casablanca
"
and
" the godfather
"
)
. trust me
, you will not see a better film come out of the 90s
.
and besides
, it
' s one hell of a ride
. note
: if anyone knows how i could get a
" bad motherfucker
" wallet
, please e
- mail me
. any help would be greatly appreciated
.
