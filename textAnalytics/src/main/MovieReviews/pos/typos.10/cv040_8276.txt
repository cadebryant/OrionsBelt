" he ' s bakc
,
and it ' s about tiome
.
" was the motto for this television series pilot
( i call it a pilot
, i don ' t care what fox network says
) revival of the cult classic british tv show
, doctor who
, that spawned no series
, whitch means there are no smart network execs out there
( not exactlly news to a lot of people
, i know
)
. the motto was well choosen
. the series was simple
, it was about htis time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in a type fourty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies
, including the evil daleks
,
adn the master
, who appears inaddition this feature
, played very badly by eric roberts
. as good as this revival wass
, there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who
. is it the acting
? hell
, no
! paul mcgann is jstu as good as any of the other seven guys who ' ve played the doctor
( including his predecessor
and off
- screen friend sylvester mccoy
, who appears once more for the regeneration scene
)
. he looks right forthe the role
, is a brilliant actor
,
and slips effortlessly inot the role
, the way my two favorites jon pertwee
and tom baker woudl
. daphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr
. grace holloway
, the doctor ' s first companion that he kisses on screen
, she is not your typical female companion who screams
,
and spends her free time making coffee for tyhe doctor
, she is a tough
, spunky american
,
and ashbrook shows this well
. young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee
,
anbd i ' ve seen him in otehr stfuf in which he usually plays tjhe punk kid who dies at thte end
( this film included
)
, which
, imho
, wastes his talent
. the only problem with the acting is eric roberts
. oney time he had to sday to mcgann ' s doctor
,
" i always dress forthe the occasion
.
"
bu he broke it uv
,
and said it so slowly thta it wounded up sounding like a song lyric
,
" i always
.
.
. dress
.
.
. for the occasion
.
" you need an actr less slow
and less reliant onthe moving his hands to act
,
and who ' s also british
, like mcgann is as the doctor
. executive producer phil segal said he wass casted because fox insisted onthe having one american star in tje role
. i dunno who thought of casting him
,
but if they ' re reading this
: news flash
: eric roberts is
* not
* a star
! he rides on his sister ' s coattails
,
and any hit movei he makes has nothing to dont wiht him
. isnt this problem teh kisses to the past
? they have references to the show so subtle taht non fans would not notice them
, only whovians would
,
and they ' re good
. is it the script or the movie as a whole
? the script is a classy piece ofthe work
, featuring a master who can spit slime out of his mouth
annd nice dialogue
,
and the movie as a whole is one fans will love
,
and it is a good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series
. so what is it
? simple
: no plot
. the master
, on his last legs
, sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro
and exterminate him
. the doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey
,
but they accidentally land in san francisco
, 1999
, december 31
, where tjhe master
, with young street hood chang lee ' s help
, opens the eye of harmony
, which will suck the earth thru it at midnight if the doctor
, with the halp of female surgeon
, dr
. grace holloway
, doesn ' t close it by
then
. virtually no plot
. i was told the movie would ' ve featured the daleks on screen
and started with moreso of a courtroom drama between the master
and tje daleks
,
but a lot of rewriting went on on the set
. that shows how smart people are
, as it would have made the movie a hell of a lot more interesting
,
and that woudl ' ve gotten a four star rating out ofthe me
.
