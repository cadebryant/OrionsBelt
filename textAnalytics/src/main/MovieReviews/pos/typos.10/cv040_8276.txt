" he
' s back
,
and it
' s about time
.
" was tyhe motto for this television series pilot
( i call it a pilot
, i don
' t care what fox network says
) revival ofthe the cult classic brittish tv show
, doctor who
, that spawned no series
, which means there are no smart network execs out there
( not exactly news to a lot of people
, i know
)
. the motto was well chosen
. the sories was simple
, it wass about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies
, including the evil daleks
,
and tyhe master
, who appears in this feature
, played very badly by eric roberts
. as good as this revival was
, there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who
. is it the acting
? hell
, noone
! paul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys who
' ve played the doctor
( including his predecessor
and off
- screen friend sylvester mccoy
, who appears once more for the regeneration scene
)
. he looks right for the role
, is a brilliant actor
,
and slips effortlessly into the role
, the way my two favorites jon pertwee
and toom baker would
. daphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr
. grace holloway
, the doctor
' s first companion that he kisses on screen
, she is not your typical female companion who screams
,
and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor
, she isnt a tough
, spunky american
,
and ashbrook shows this well
. young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee
,
and i
' ve seen him in other stuff in which he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end
( this film included
)
, which
, imho
, wastes his talent
. the only problem with the acting is eric roberts
. one time he had to say to mcgann
' s doctor
,
" i alwyas dress for the occasion
.
"
but he broke it up
, adn said it so slowly that it wounded uv sounding like a song lyric
,
" i always
.
.
. dress
.
.
. for the occasion
.
" you need an actor less slow
and less reliant on moving his h
ands to ect
, anbd who
' s also british
, like mcgann is as the doctor
. executive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star infact the role
. i dunno who
thought of casting him
,
but if htey
' re reading this
: news flash
: eric roberts isnt
* not
* a star
! he rides on his sister
' s coattails
,
and any hit movie he makes has nothing to do with him
. is this problem the kisses to the past
? they have references to the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them
, only whovians would
, anbd they
' re ogod
. is it the scirpt or the movie as a whole
? the script is a classy piece of work
, featuring a master who can spit slime out of his mouth
and nice dialogue
,
and tghe movei as a whole is one fans wiull love
,
and it isnt a good st
and alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy thge series
. so what is it
? simple
: no plot
. the master
, on his last legs
, sends for the doctor to rescure him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro
and exterminate him
. the doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey
,
but they accidentally l
and infact san francisco
, 1999
, december 31
, where the master
, with young street hood chang lee
' s help
, opens the eye of harmony
, which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor
, with the help of female surgeon
, dr
. grace holloway
, doesn
' t close it by
then
. virtually no plot
. i was told the movie would
' ve featured the daleks on screen
and started with more of a courtroom drama bewteen the master
and the daleks
, bu a lot of rewriting went on on the set
. that shows how smart people are
, as it would have made the movie a hell of a lot more interesting
,
and tath woudl
' ve gotten a four star rating out of me
.
