. it is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other
and who has their pwn hidden agenda
. matt dillon stars as sam lombardo
. sam is the kind of guy that every woman would like to sink their claws into
,
and sam obviously knows it
and uses it to his own advantage
. he isn
' t the obvious best of actors
,
but dillon does give a convincing performance
. howver
, his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end ofthe the film
, making it look as
though his character has lost all of his ethics
and principles
,
al
though he never had many to start out with in the frist place
. neve campbell
, who most people relate to scream
and scream 2
, plays blue bay outcast suzie toller
. suzie obviously hasnt some serious issues to deal wih which are obvious from her first scene in the film
. campbell is very successful with this character
, adding the slightest bit of charm tothe a seemingly repulsive character
and making her fun to watch
. playing kelly van ryan is denise richards
. kelly is your typical
, rich
, sexy
, head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses
, like her sexpot mother s
andra
. one of the most interesting things about this film is how it compares
and contrasts the relationship between kelly adn her mother
. denise richards
, still hot off the press from starship troopers
, gives the most interesting performance in the entire film
. infront the begginning
, kelly looks to be a paper thin character
,
but richards adds a little more spice
and ultimately makes the character not only sexy
,
but dominating as well
. kevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette
. thsi charactor looks to be one of the most boring
, predictable in the film
.
however
, it is a relationship revealed between him
and suzie that adds depth to his story
. still
, tyhe film doesn
' t seem to gain much ffrom bacon
' s performance
, only his name
. in the supporting cast
, theresa russell plays the much oversexed s
andra van ryan
, daphne rubin
- vega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez
,
and bill murray shines as sam
' s lawyer
, ken bowden
. hats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy tothe the film
.
al
though wild things was displayed by the press as being an erotic thriller
, the eroticism
, which is portrayed with good taste
, is kept to a minimum
and focusses omre on thte plot
and tje relationships between the charactors
. this is truly a very good film worth seeing if your looking for a movie with a thick plot filled with it
' s share ofthe twists
.
