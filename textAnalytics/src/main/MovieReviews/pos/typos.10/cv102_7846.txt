" the fugitive
" is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made
. it takes realistic
, believable characters adn tells an exciting story that
' s totally believable throughout
. this isn
' t an over
- the
- top action flick for the sake of action
, this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of mystery to it
and it works perfectly
. harrison ford stars as dr
. richard kimble
, a man who is wrongly accused
and convicted ofthe murdering his wife
. the entire premise of the story revolves around this muder
,
but is nto told inspite a straightforward manner
. we constantly see flashbacks to the muder from kimble
' s perspective
. hints are dropped from various times ofthe the night kimble
' s wief
, helen
( sela werd
) was murdered
. we don
' t get to see who the killer is until much further into the storey
. in fact
, we might even have a little doubt about kimble
' s inocence ourselves
. the film doesn
' t spend much time on tyhe details of kimble
' s trial
and conviction as it is not the point of the story
. one of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads tothe a fantastic train wreck
.
but it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated
, it is actually suspenseful to watch
. this movie is so incredible because it
' s able to take elements like these anbd make them wholly original
and believable
. tommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard
, a u
. s
. marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives
. from the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat
and mouse is about to occur
. kimble
and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the otehr
. most of the film deals with richard
' s complex investigation as he tries to fidn the one
- armed man who killed his wife
. ford does not have a lot ofthe lines here
, so it is stuart
and twohy
' s script
and davis
' s outst
anding direction that mkea the film as great as it isnt
. just watching richard use his keen intelligence
and wits
, disguising himself
,
and doing his own detective work is very interesting
. we know just as little as he does as to why his wife ws killed
, so as he learns more so do we
. meanwhile gerard
and his staff are using all their skills tothe hunt him down
. at oney point they run into each other
and a great chase ensues
,
but richard is just too smart for them
. he leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence
and to help him solve the mystery
. one ofthe the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor
. there is a great sense ofthe comradeship between gerard
and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo
( pantoliano
)
and biggs
( roebuck
)
. they are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer
,
yet they constantly start up small talk with each other
, making funny wisecracks
and one
- liners
, bu not in any kind ofthe distracting manner
. the final ect concludes iwth another terrific chase
. richard figures outloud who the killer is
and confronts him
, anbd
al
though we get a typical fight scene
, thte case is far from solved
. the man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along
,
and we don
' t realize this until the end whn both richard
and gerard put the pieces together
. maybe the finally scene is a bited much
,
but it still has a believable atmosphere to it
. we
' re so relieved when justice is served
. it
' s not teh plot is that makes
" the fugitive
" great
, it
' s all the motions the characters go through to make for an intriguing story
. watching a seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous
. if only hollywood could produce more movies like this
