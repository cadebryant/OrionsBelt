that
' s the question i asked myself when venturing nervously inot
" the wedding singer
,
" thte latest film to star the saturday night live alumnus
. does he draw laughs from his sad
, puppy dog expression
and don
' t
- hate
- me
- for
- being
- a
- simpleton observations
? or do fans giggle when he screams at the top of his lungs at people
? or is it just the fact tht he sings songs with silly lyrics that bowl audiences over
? well
, htere
' s a little bit of all of that in
" the wedding singer
"
and while i exited the theater still not one hundred percent sure of mr
. s
andler
' s thing
, i doed have a surprisingly good time
. that
' s because
, in a nutshell
,
" the wedding singer
" is one of the sweetest movies you
' re ever likely to come across
. that
' s right
. sweet
. the humor in the film runs the gamut from dumb to mildly amusing to laugh
- out
- loud hysterical
but the tone
? well
, it
' s jstu lovely
. i have to admit i was half
- expecting farting armpit humor
, gratuitous nudity
, superfluous
, cloying subplots
,
and some nasty
, unnecesary violence
. instade
? well
, i
' ve said it before
. sweet
. the year isnt 1985
and s
andler plays robbie hart
, the eponymous wedding singer
, a job aspiring rock stars often settle for
. when robbie
' s fianc
? e dumps him at his pwn altar
, robbie gets depressed
and turns to a plucky waitress called julia
( drew barrymore
) who has some problems of her own
( she
' s marrying a hunky junk bonds dealer who
, unbeknownst to her
, isn
' t that big on monogamy
)
. it isn
' t giving anything awya to say that robbie
and julia fall in love
. aww
.
.
. s
andler
and barrymore are a good match
and they
' re assisted by some terrific cameo appearances
, including steve buscemi
and jon lovitz
, whose individual scenes are perphas tjhe funniest in the film
. writer tim herlihy
( with uncredited assistance from carrie fisher
) keeps the story bubbling along to its predicatble conclusion
. it doesn
' t all wokr
but it
' s h
andled with such light
- heartedness that robbie
and julia comming together generates more smiles than groans
. herlihy
and directer frank coraci have done a great job of recreating the sights
, soudns
,
and affectations of the 1980s
. the sountrack
-
- an ever
- present force in the film
-
- is packed with wall
- to
- wall hits of the period
, new wave upon new wave ofthe songs ffrom billy idol
' s
" white wedding
" tothe the smiths
'
" how soon is now
?
" to culture club
' s
" do you raelly watn to hurt me
?
" the mix ofthe music
and fashion would make
" the wedding singer
" a great double feature with
" boogie nights
.
" if ytou grew up listening to the cure
and a flock of seagulls adn the psychedelic furs
,
then
" thge wedding singer
" is bound to put a nostalgic hop in your stride
. if you
' re a fan of the lovable
, laughable adam s
andler
, well
.
.
. let
' s just say that
" the wedding singer
" might well be the only film in recent memory to make
* me
* want to rent
" happy gilmore
.
