the postman delivers
but not first class the postman a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman
[ warning
: my opinion of htis film is definitely iin the minority of reviewers perhaps because it hits so many of my cinematic
buttons
: post
- apocalypse stories
, hope in a desperate situation
, grassroots uprisings
and kevin costner
. even worse
, i
thought tath
" waterworld
" was watchable
. read the following with those particular grains ofthe salt
.
] it
' s the yera 2013 anbd things have fallen apart
. due to a world war in the late nineties
, the resulting three
- year winter anbd a devestating plague
, life in the former united states has been reduced to isolated primitive fiefdoms
.
al
though this is the future
, it looks like a western
. as the film opens
, kevin costner
( his character
' s name is never revealed
) is w
andering the utah wastel
ands with only his mule bill for company
. giving extraordinarily bad shakespearean performances in exchange for food
and lodging
, costner is an outsider in a l
and of outsiders
. running into even worse luck
, he is forcibly conscripted into the racially pure holnist army of general bethlehem
( will patton
)
. the rag
- tag retro
- futuristic cavalry is the descendent of militia groups annd is even called the
" clan
" after a brutal boot camp
, he
(
and ytou can see this coming a mile away
) escapes
. taking shelter in a wrecked postal truck
, he liberates the uniform
and mail bag from the skeleton in the cab who no longer has a uise for either
. once he reaches oregon
, l
and of beautiful women
, bright youngsters
and rock
and roll
; he pretends to be a representative fomr the
" restored congress of the united states of america
"
. this scam gets him inside the walled towns where the promise of mail delivery renews optimism in the hearts of the inhabitants
. food
and other opportunities come his way in tyhe form of spirited abby
( olivia williams
) who wants him to father a child because her husb
and is sterile
. shortly her husb
and is killed by bethlehem
and she
and the postman
( as costner is referred to for the rest of the film
) become a reluctant item
.
al
though the postman knows he
' s running a fraud
, the concept of renewed communications sets the kids
' imagination afire
( especially ford lincoln mercury
( larenz tate
)
, his second
- in
- comm
and
)
and they form a new pony express dedicated to getting the mail through
. the revived postal service doubles as an army to fight the holnists
' tyranny
. the postman has become a symbol for hope in a rube goldberg manner
.
al
though the movie appeals tothe my sensibilities
, there are so many thigns wrong with it that they can hardly be counted
. it
' s derivitive ofthe costner
' s own
" waterworld
"
and clint eastwood westerns
. there
' s little here tath we haven
' t seen dozens of times before
. the film is often down
- right corny
. a scene where the postman is on horseback
and grabs a letter from the h
ands of a bright
- eyed child is embarrassing in its slow
- motion banality
. the film
' s final few minutes should have been left onthe the cutting room floor
. despite the film
' s excessive threee hour length
, sevral things are never explained
. what ws the war about
? how doed civilization change so rapidly
? everyone has horses
: where did all they come ffrom
? the
" law of eights
" that bethlehem lives by seems to have its origins somewhere beyond hte film
,
but where
? are we to believe that the rest of the world isnt in the same shape annd hasn
' t made their way west to help or conquer
? there is some jumbled symbolism here that doesn
' t appear to make sense
. the tale is obviously saying that communication can defeat evil in much the same way that the internet has the potential to topple governments
,
but beyond that there are some oddities
. the evil army is called
" holnists
" which sounds coincidentally like the new age
" holism
"
,
but why
? is it another coincidence that it takes place infront 2013
, just one year affter many ancient prophesies
( including the ending of tyhe mayan calendar
) predict a new world for mankind
? why is the general named
" bethlehem
"
? there seems to be soem reason for that
,
but what
? sometimes the movie feels like a joke
. an army of postal workers armed with guns
? considering the headlines of reccent years
, it takes a tremendous leap of faith to cheer for these guys
. it
' s even more difficult to accept those re
- powering the federal government as the heroes
. given the current climate of tjhe country
and the distrust of big government
, it
' s asking a lot for tje audience to get behind the film
' s nationalism
. even with its numerous flaws
, the movie all comes together
, if only for those who have the same weaknesses thast i hvae
. it
' s doubtful that
" the postman
" is going to find much of an audience
,
but a few ofthe us are going to have a good time
. besides we
' re all awaiting the fall ofthe civilization caused by hte year 2000 milennium computer bug
.
( michael redman hasnt written this column for over 22 eyasr
and would like to annoance that the
" michael redman
" arrested near indianapolis last week fo accepting an illicit package from federal express is
, to the best of his knowledge
, not him
. perhaps this similarly
- named person should have used kevin costner
' s postal sevice
.
