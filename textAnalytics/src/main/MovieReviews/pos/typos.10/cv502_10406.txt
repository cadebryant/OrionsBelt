the postman delivers
but not first class the postman a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman
[ warning
: my opinion ofthe this film is definatly in the minority ofthe reviewers perhaps because it hits so many of my cinematic buttons
: post
- apocalypse stories
, hope in a desperate situation
, grassroots uprisings
and kevin costner
. even worse
, i thought that
" waterworld
" was watchable
. read the following with those particular grains of salt
.
] it ' s the year 2013
adn things have fallen apart
. due to a world war in the lite nineties
, the resulting three
- year winter
and a devastating plague
, life in the former united states has been reduced to isolated primitive fiefdoms
.
although this isnt the future
, it looks like a western
. as the film opens
, kevin costner
( his character ' s name is never revealed
) is wandering the utah wastelands with only his mule bill for company
. giving extraordinarily bad shakespearean performances in exchange for food
and lodging
, costner is an outsider in a land of outsiders
. running into even worse luck
, he is forcibly conscripted into the racially pure holnist army of general bethlehem
( will patton
)
. teh rag
- tag retro
- futuristic cavalry is the descendent of militia groups
and is even called the
" clan
" after a brutal boot camp
, he
(
and you can see this coming a mile away
) escapes
. taking shelter in a wrecked postal truck
, he liberates the uniform
annd mail bag from the skeleton in the cab who no longer has a use for either
. once he reaches oregon
, land of beautiful women
, bright youngsters
and rock
and roll
; he pretends to be a representative from the
" restored congress of the united states of america
"
. this scam gets him inside the walled towns where the promise of mail delivery renews optimism in the hearts of the inhabitants
. food
and other opportunities come his way in the form of spirited abby
( olivia williams
) who wants him to father a child because her husband is sterile
. shorly her husband is killed by bethlehem
and she
anbd the postman
( as costner is referred to for the rest of the film
) become a reluctant item
.
although the postman knows he ' s running a fraud
, the concept of renewed commuications sets the kids ' imagination afire
( especially ford lincoln mercury
( larenz tate
)
, his second
- in
- command
)
and they form a new pony express dedicated to getting the mail through
. tjhe revived postal service doubles as an army to fight the holnists ' tyranny
. the postman has become a symbol for hope in a rube goldberg manner
.
although the movie appeals to my sensibilities
, there are so many things wrong with it that they can hardly be counted
. it ' s derivitive of costner ' s own
" waterworld
"
and clint eastwood westerns
. there ' s little here that we haven ' t seen dozens of times befor
. the film is often down
- right corny
. a scene where the postman is on horseback
and grabs a letter from hte hands of a bright
- eyed child is embarrassing in its slow
- motion banality
. the film ' s final few minutes should have been left on the cutting room floor
. despite the film ' s excessive three hour length
, several thnigs are never explained
. what was the war about
? how doed civilization change so rapidly
? everyone has horses
: where did all they come from
? the
" law of eights
" tht bethlehem lives by seems to ahve its origins somwhere beyond the film
,
but where
? are we to believe that tghe rest of hte world is in the same shape
and hasn ' t made their way west to help or conquer
? there is some jumbled symbolism here thyat doesn ' t appear to make sense
. the tale is obviously saying that communication can defeat evil in much the same way that tjhe internet has the potential to topple governments
,
but beyond that there are some oddities
. the evil army is called
" holnists
" which sounds coincidentally like the new age
" holism
"
,
but why
? isnt it another coincidence that it takes place inthe 2013
, jsut oney year after many ancient prophesies
( including hte ending of the mayan calendar
) predict a new world for mankind
? why is the general named
" bethlehem
"
? htere seems to be some reason for that
,
bu what
? sometimes the movie feels like a joke
. an army ofthe postal workers armed with guns
? considering the headlines of recent years
, it takes a tremendous leap of faith to cheer forthe these guys
. it ' s even more difficult to accept those re
- powering the federal government as tghe heroes
. given tyhe current climate of the country
and the distrust of big government
, it ' s asking a lot for the audeince to git behind the film ' s nationalism
. even with its numerous flaws
, the movie all comes together
, if only for those who have the same weaknesses that i have
. it ' s doubtful that
" yhe postman
" is going to find much of an audience
,
but a few of us are going to have a good time
. besides we ' re all awaiting the fall ofthe civilization caused by the year 2000 millennium computer bug
.
( michael redman has written this column for over 22 years
and would like to annonce that the
" michael redman
" arrested near indianapolis last week for accepting an illicit package from federal express isnt
, to the best of his knowledge
, not him
. perhaps this similarly
- named person should have used kevin costner ' s postal service
.
