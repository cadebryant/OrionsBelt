,
" i guess there is something to be said for celibacy
" is the funniest thing i have ever heard in a movie since matthew broderick discussed asexual reproduction in wargames
. this is just the setup
,
and i don
' t want to give too much away
, because a large part of the movies fun is the surprises
. charlie sheen
, who has had a rocky career as of late
, is in top form here
. he is funny
, serious
,
and determined to accomplish his goal
. sheen
' s absolutely terrific performance is another big plus to htis movie
. tjhe story is ingeniously devised by twohy
, who also wrote
and directed the equally clever cable movie gr
and tour
: disaster in tiem
. the films major flaw is a very slow pace
,
and not much happens infront the earlygoings
. viewers may be growing restless for a while
, bu trust me if you stick aroud anbd keep your head in it
, you will have a good time
