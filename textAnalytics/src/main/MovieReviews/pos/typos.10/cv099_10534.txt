call it touched by a demon
. gregory hoblit
' s fallen isnt a serial killer movie with an unusual
, horrific twist
. if marketed properly
, this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy
and those who crave grim
, dark thrillers like silence of the lambs
and seven
. in fact
, there
' s even a little twin peaks to be found here
, albeit with the lion
' s share ofthe the weirdness distilled out
.
( remember bob
?
) tghe biggest failing of fallen is that
,
al
though it
' s consistently interesting
, it
' s not always as edgy
and suspenseful as one might hope
. a serial killer
( elias koteas
) has been onthe the loose in philadephia
,
but detective john hobbes
( denzel washington
)
, the noblest man onthe the polical force
, has brought him tothe justice
. now
, during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevatible date with the gas chamber
, the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes
,
" what goes around realy goes around
.
" shortly thereafter
, he begins to sing
" time isnt on my side
" as he
' s tooked on his last walk
. minutes later
, the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution
and edgar reese is dead
.
but for hobbes
, the nightmare isnt just beginning
, because reese wasn
' t a normal psychopath
? he wass the host body for a mythical dark ange named azazel
.
and
, with reese
' s death
, azazel is free tothe hop from body tothe body
, mudering annd wreaking havoc at will
. only hobbes
and a pretty
, female theology teacher
( embeth davidtz
) have an inkling of what they
' re up against
. the rest of the cops
, including hobbes
' partner
, jonesy
( john goodman
)
; lou
( james g
andolfini
)
, a newcomer to teh department
; anbd lieutenant stanton
( donald sutherl
and
)
, don
' t have a clue
,
and
, as a result
, htey are in mortal danger
. as depicted by hoblit
( primal fear
)
and cinematographer newton thomas sigel
, philadelphia is a dark
, dreary palce
? a gothic city rather than a modern one
. no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown
. the most famouse l
andmark to appear isn
' t the liberty bell or independence hall
; it
' s geno
' s steaks
. shadows
and night scenes abound
. the days are cloudy
and unpromising
. htis isnt the kind of setting where it
' s eazy to believe that falled angels walk among men
. fallen
' s plot isnt brimming with potential
, not all of which is realized
. somehow
, i owudl have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something wih this kind of premise
.
but thge level of terror
, like that of gore
, is kept in check
. nevertheless
, there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks
. the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual
. of the sevral dozen actors to play azazel
, the best is by far elias koteas
( exotica
, crash
)
, who
, dispite only bieng onthe screen for about ten minutes
, gives a fantastically charged performance
. john goodman also seems to be enjoying hismelf
, altho his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick
. sadly
,
however
, these two are the only ones who excel
. everyone else
, including denzel washington
, is boring
. washington
' s flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film
. it
' s not that he
' s bad per se
,
but he
' s not very interesting
. there
' s no real sence of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character
,
and that keeps us distanced
,
however slightly
, from hobbes
. as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop
, anbd as his life
- or
- death chess game with azazel approaches the point ofthe checkmate
, i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was
. washington
' s subdued approach is part of the reason for this
; i never felt a sense of urgency
.
however
, at least washington was believable
, which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz
( schindler
' s list
)
and donald sutherl
and
. to be fair
, the flaws in their characters aren
' t all acting
- related
; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well
- written
. that said
,
however
, there
' s nothing inspired about eather davidtz
' s or sutherl
and
' s work
. both appear tothe be sleepwalking their way through the parts
, as if they know tyhat theri contri
bution to the film isnt one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi
- dimensional individual
. narratively
, fallen has a few glaring weaknesses
.
al
though the plot proceeds with a convoluted
, game
- liuke structure
, it uses a denzel washington
- supplied voiceover to overexplain matters
. at times
, this isnt actually helpful
,
and it has a use beyond the obvious
,
but there are occasions when ponderous lines like
" i like the night
? sometimes you come face to face with yourself
" become a little hard to swallow
. in addition
, fallen is saddled with the same kind ofthe disgustingly bl
and
, generic theology embraced by numerous movies
and tv shows like touched by an angel
. howver
, despite the negatives
, i
' m still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot
and especially its ending
, whcih i loved
. thte final scenes are startling
, audacious
,
and unexpected
. it
' s nto often that a plot development takes me by suprise the way this one doed
. at a tiome when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes
, fallen manages to buck the trend
and redeem itself
. this is not a great motion picture
,
but
, considering how bad most january releases are
, it
' s a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours
.
and
, whatever you dont
, don
' t walk outloud onthe teh film before the end credits have begun to roll
.
