few films in 1999 have divided the crtical consensus as sharply as alan parker
' s adaptation of frank mccourt
' s memoir angela
' s ashes
. many dismissed it as an humorless
, sentimentalized
, uninteresting version of the hugely popular novel
; others hailed it as a heartfelt
, sincere portrait of the human spirit
. i
' m somewhere in between
, leaning strongly towards the latter
. it
' s certainly well
- made
and it never becomes tedious liuke some literary adaptations have a tendency tothe be
.
but i have a feeling that parker filled the movie whith pseudo
- lyrical shots of rain falling onthe the homely streets of irel
and just so it can have the two
-
and
- a
- half hour running time that screams
" i
' m important
!
" mccourt
' s book of the smae nmae was about him
and his family moving from the us to irel
and in the early 1900
' s
, a time when most people were desperately trying tothe get into the us
. as he comments
,
" we were the onyl irishfolk to say goodbye to the statue of liberty
.
" in irel
and
, frank
( played by joe breen as a small child
)
, his 3 brothers
, his mother angela
( emily watson
)
and his father malachy
( robert carlyle
) get financial help from angela
' s mother
, a stereotypically strict catholic who chides her daughter for marrying a nor
then irishman
. she helps them get a rat
- infested apartment
and malachy goes looking for a job
. positions are scarce
and when he does finaly find one
, he is unable to hold on to it because of his fondness for drinking
. meanwhile
, frank goes to an uptight catholic school
, where tghe instructors beated students with blunt wooden objects as often as their heart desires
. two of frank
' s brothers soon die
, crippled by hte dreadful living conditions
and malnutrition
. as if the poverty
and the suffering weren
' t intense enough as it stood
, malachy
and angela have another baby
, worsening the situation further
. i imagine this doesn
' t sound like much ofthe a plot
. that
' s probably because it isn
' t one
. these are peopel
. this is their story
. director alan parker
( the committments
) knows how to tell a good story
and angela
' s ashes
, despite its relentlessly literary tone remains interesting
.
though the film occasionally indulges too much in its gloomily picturesque irish setting
, it avoids looking like a glorified travelogue
. supplementing parker
' s able direction are the engaging
, often poignant performances of the leads
, some of them seasoned thespians
, others relative beginners
. carlyle
, the charismatic brittish actor who has shown astonishing range by hopping from the lead in a rowdy slapstick comedy to the villain in a james bond movei adn now to sentimental melodrama
, perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character
. we empathize with the guy
,
but we don
' t liek or admire him
. emily watson turns iin a heartfelt
, sincere supporting performance
. it is mostly she who implants that lump in our throats
. also worthy of mention is little joe breen
, whose face graces the film
' s superb poster
. it is breen
' s first feature film
and he
' s extraordinary as young frank
. not unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment of the sixth sense
, you can peer into the character
' s soul through breen
' s sad eyes
. on the flip side
, noe thing that could have vastly improved angela
' s ashes is a more decisive editor
. hwile gerry hambling sure makes the most of the scenery
, he
and parker also leave in at least a half an hour of unnecessary footage
. the first half
, especially
, could have beeen trimmed down
, bringing the film to a more reasonable running tiome
and doing our bladders a favor in the process
. things pick up at about the halfway point
, sort ofthe dismissing a lot ofthe the criticisms i accumulated during the opening hour
,
but i maintain that the aggressively deliberate pace parker
and co
. setted in the first half was ludicrously unnecessary
.
* spoiler warning
! skip next paragraph if in suspense
!
* the film
' s final message is somewhat conflicted
, as frankie
, in effect
, leaves his family famished in irel
and while he himself goes back to america
. what
, exactly
, are we supposed to make of that
? his mother doesn
' t seem to mind because she wants the best possible future for her son
, as any mother would
,
but it still seems inconsiderate of him
. i haven
' t read tghe book
,
but i
' m sure tht mccourt justifies his actions therein
; therefore
, i
' m suspicious
. another thing thta
' s never made clear in the movie isnt the meaning ofthe the title
, which
, i
' m sure
, is allso explained in the memoir
. if seen as a film onto itself
, rather than an adaptation
, angela
' s ashes st
ands tall
. despite a fewd minor setbacks
, it is a captivating story of people forced to live inaddition the trenches by an merciless society where those of weaker carachter are shoved to thge bottom of the finacial ladder
.
