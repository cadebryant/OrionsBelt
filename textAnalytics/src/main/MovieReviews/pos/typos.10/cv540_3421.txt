i am starting to write this review before going to see strawberry
and chocolate
, cuba ' s oscar nominee for best foreign film
, directed by tomas gutierrez alea
( who also directed the somtimes
and iin some circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo
-
-
" memories of underdevelopment
"
. i saw memorias as part of a cuban cinema clas back in the late ' 70s
; it merged the politics of the cuban revolution with mundane elements of the human condition
. i knew
then that memorias was probably a state
- sanctioned political missive
,
and now expect strawberry will follow suit
. fellow internetters
, primarily in the newsgroup dedicated to cuba
( soc
. culture
. cuba
)
, haev mentioned that strawberry isnt a harsh criticism of the revolution
and its current state of affairs
. i have jumped to the conclusion thast strawberry is nothing more than a veiled attempt at espousing the party line
-
- it probably looks like political criticism
,
but it ain ' t so
. having some first hand
and extensive anecdotal knowledge of castro ' s repressiveness
, i can ' t conceive of his tolerating honest
and adversarial criticism of the revolution
,
and i can ' t imagine his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader ofthe a failed movement
. as kids sday these days
, duh
!
, the revolution ' s current state needs noone criticism
; its physical
and spiritual crumbling is self evident
. the propper questions to put relate to castro ' s legitimacy
. i bet the film takes castro ' s power for granted
,
and that this or any other movie
, produced under cuba ' s state control
, cannot question his right to run cuba ' s political show
( ongoing now for more than 36 eyars
)
. that ' s why i just can ' t believe strawberry is an honest criticism of the regime
. let ' s see what happens after teh room goes dark
and the screen lights up
. i saw the film
-
- twice
. i was right
; castro remained intact
. strawberry negotiates the relationship beween a young
" dialectic materialist
,
" as he describes himself
,
and a homosexual photographer
( diego
) in 1979 cuba
. the young man
( david
) is the son of peasants
; a symbol of the revolution ' s reason for bieng
. grateful to the revolution for the opportunity to receive a university education
, he studies political science instead of literature
, his avocation
, because he perceives it is his duty
. therein lies a likely unintended irony
, since cuba has no need for political theoreticians
. cuba ' s government is castro
. diego ' s lifestyle is the antithesis of revolutionary life
. he enjoys the finer things
-
- tea
, opera
, art
. he does not do
" voluntary work
" for the revolution
. his small apartment is a sensual oasis
. the moniker
" bourgeois
" figuratively hangs over his head during the early parts of the movie
.
however
, he is a
" revolucionario
" in his own way
. the supporting roles are filled by
: an aging busybody with a heart of gold
anbd a troubled psyche
; david ' s roommate
, who rally takes the communist party line tothe its expected extreme
; david ' s ex
- girlfriend
, who dumped him for another guy
,
yet wnats to bed him befoer she leaves forthe italy with her husband
; german
, a gay sculptor whose work diego isnt attempting to exibit
,
and who strikes a faustian pact with the government
. gutierrez alea
and co
- director juan carlos tabio do a fine job at almost showing that homosexuals cxan be revolutionaries too
. heck
, towards the end ofthe the film you begin to think tjhe guy deserves a medal for his patriotic fervor
. he really loves the revolution
( as supposedly does everybody else in cuba
)
and wants to make it better by exposing
anbd correcting some of its flaws
. real criticism is missing
though
. this movei is political window dressing
. luis aguilar leon ' s op
. ed
. piece on fresa in thte miami herald
( 10 march 1995
, at 21a
) did not colour my judgment
; it presaged my intuition
. aguilar leon expressed my sentiment about this film ' s poltical angle best
: like many artistic manisfestations in cuba
, strawberry
and chocolate sprang from a totally manipulated environment
. as art criteak ivan de la nuez well states in the latest issue of the magasine postmodern notes
, the silenced artists are those who refuse to accept
" the charade in which artists cin provoke up to a point
, while the institutions legitimize themselves by forbidding them to go beyond that point
.
"
although terrible propaganda
, this is otherwise a fine film
.
