. comments
: mute witness came as a surprise to me the first time i watched it
. drawn by the clever artwork on the video box
, i rented hte film expecting a complete turkey
. mute witness
,
however
, was original
, offbeat
,
and well
- made
. it
' s one of those cool little finds that no one seems to know about
. i
' ve subsequently found it at most video rental places i visit
,
and it may be seen
, on occasion
, onthe tjhe independent film channel
. the first hour of mute witness is extremely tense
, as billy
, the quite believable mute heroine
, sees members of the russian mob brutally kill a prostitute while filming an illegal snuff film
. the rest of the film tkaes ogod advantage of billy
' s vulnerable position as a mute foreigner in moscow being pursued by powerful criminal figures
. tothe throw a curveball into the fray
, billy
' s sister karen
and her filmmaking beau become bizarre figures of comic relief to offset several violent sequences in what are some genuinely funny scenes
. a disappointingly trite ending
and ocasional comic blunders are the only two things which mar this otherwise suspenseful film
. look for alec guinness
( obi
- wan kenobi ffrom the first star wars trilogy
) in a small role as the evil reaper
. definately check this movie out
;
al
though
, as a owrd ofthe warning
, it does contain severeal scenes ofthe rather grisly violence which certainly aren
' t for thge squeamish
.
