- sound advice from capone
( paul campbell
) to his squaddie
( or partner
)
, floyd
( winston bell
)
. jamaican film
, shot entirely on video
, featuring a st
andard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo
- styled brotherhood morals
(
and a littel gunplay
)
. capone
, a tough as nails super cop
, gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after sucesfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home
( while he was with his lady
)
and killed his partner in front of him
. when he arrives
, he discovers that the ghetto where he growed up has gotten worse
, thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie
( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw
)
, so named because his left h
and has been amputated
and replaced by a grasping hook
)
. capone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the areal churches anbd
, much to his disappointment
, also finds out his childhood friend ratty
( mark danvers
) has been helping him
. torn between doing his job
and protecting his best friend
, capone must make some hard decisions infact order to make thigsn right again
. directed deftly by first timne jamaican filmmaker chris browne
( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back
and instinct
)
, one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while
. shots are h
andled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of teh aforementioned john woo films
, all
though the acation isn
' t as hyperkinetic as most of woo
' s films are
. the acation scenes are h
andled with a kind of flair
though
,
and eventually begin to take on a life of their own
( beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after
)
. the make
- up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well
, with flawless squib wrok on display from tyhe effects team
. the casted is superb
and listening to their dialogue
, spoken with thick jamaican accents
( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang
)
, just adds to the interest
. paul campbell
, as the
` loose cannon
' capone
, essays his role perfectly
, displaying the right amount of menace
and compassion at the right times
. mark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty
, the part
- time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields
and organizing block parties to bring people together
. unfortunately
, carl bradshaw is given tyhe least to do
and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective
( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him
)
,
but
then again
, that sould be the way his character was intended to be portrayed
. the music in the film is composed of all reggae songs
,
and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists
, sly
and robbie
( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones
, maxi priest
, bob dylan
, james brown
, grace jones
, herbie hancock
, bootsy collins
,
and carly simon among others
)
. the end credit song
,
` we run tings
'
, by the group red dragon
, is pretty decent
and carries on the theme of the movie established early onthe by the quote that opens this review
. oddly enough
, desmond ballentine
( who plays the character deportee
) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of
` gangsta
' reggae as the performer ninjaman
,
and he doesn
' t contri
bute a single song to the film
( taht i could see
)
, which is virtually unheard of here in the us
. at the time of this writting
, third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us
, coming off of a six
- month box
- office breaking run iin jamaica
, where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time
( bringing in
$ 21 million in jamaica
, which is rougly
$ 500
, 000 us
)
. palm pictures
( the company thast released the offbeat
,
but entertaining six
- string samurai
) is the comany releasing tyhe film annd considering that their main focus is the dvd market
, i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters
. chris blackwell
, founder of palm pictures
, was also involved in the production ofthe another jamaican box
- office smash in 1981 entitled countryman
, so i
' d say he has a pretty good track recrod
. overall
, third world cop is a preety entertaining homage to the films of john woo
, ringo lam
, tsui hark
,
and many other action films by directors from hong kong
. if action films are your thing
and you don
' t mind intermittent subtitles
,
then you can
' t go wrong wih this film
. the performances anbd tje story are solid
( if only a little cliched
)
and the action is tight
. i
' m nto sure waht the other jamaican films released in that country are like
,
but apparently third world cop
' s honors are well deserved
.
