airplane
! is considered amung many to be the epitome ofthe satire film
- making
. after all
, it
' s broght to us by one ofthe the best known satire writing
/ directing teams
. even if most people don
' t recognize tjhe names behind the films
, htey are binded to recognize the titles
: airplane
!
, top secret
, the naked gun
,
and hot shots tothe name a few
.
but
al
though the zucker
/ abrahams
/ zucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in 1977
, airplane
! remains the true cornerstone of their work
,
and their directorial de
buts
. inwhich the seventies
, disaster films seemed to be at an all time high
. films like earthquake
, the towering inferno
, adn the poseidon adventure were big hits
. there was also a serieses about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane
- a series that spanned the entire decade
.
and so
, in 1980
, we were introduced to a newyorker airplane diaster film
. this time the diaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean
.
.
. it had to do with bad fish
. airplane
! is the story of ted striker
( robert hays
)
- an ex
- fighter
- pilot who has never gotten over thge fact that a decision he had to make in hte midst of war led to the death of six
, er
, seven comrades
. unable to stop living in the past
, ted
' s world fell apart
. he spent his time moving from city tothe city without ever haveing a stable job
,
and eventually
, as we begin tihs film
, is getting dumped by his lover
, flight attendant elaine dickinson
( julie hagerty
)
. in a desperat attempt not tothe lose her
, ted buys a ticket for the same flight elaine is working
. unfortunately
, she is unsympathetic adn even criticizes ted for following her
, whic leaves him wallowing in self
- pity
. in the midst of it all
, something happens
. someone gets sick
.
then another
. thn another
. soon
, the whole plane is full ofthe deathly
- ill chicago
- bound people
.
.
.
and when tjhe pilots get sick
( played by peter graves
, kareem abdul
- jabbar
, annd frank ashmore
)
, who will save the day
?
( gee
, i wonder
) of course the main draw here is the non
- stop
" whiz
- bang
" comedy
, with a hefty dose of both visual anbd spoken gags
.
al
though i had seen this movie a few times before
, i was still laughing thru the entire thing
. the most fun character by far isnt the doctor
, played by leslie nielsen
. he
' s a dry
, subtle
, sterotypically straight
- faced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the film
. in a film like this
, you
' re not really expecting an elaborate production
, so one cxan
' t complain about the amateurish qualit
. what you can complain about is the absolutly annoying johnny
, played by stephen stucker
. this character is pointless
, nauseating
,
and very unfunny
. i don
' t know why he was put in there
,
and i don
' t think anybody will find a good excuse
.
and when the film nears an end
, it slows down quite a bit
, almost getting old
. you gotta give it to a movie that only runs 88 minutes
and can feel two housr long
. aside from that
, airplane
! is really a top
- notch spoof that iwll likely forever be known as a spoof classic
. it would be a good choice to pop in the vcr with a group of friends
, especially if they haven
' t seen it
.
and if htey ask what the plot is
, just tell
' em
" it
' s a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film
,
but thast
' s not important right now
.
" if you
' ve seen the film
, you
' ll underst
