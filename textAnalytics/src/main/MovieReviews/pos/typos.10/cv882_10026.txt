airplane
! is considered among many to be the epitome of satire film
- making
. after all
, it ' s brought to us by one of the best known satire writing
/ directing teams
. even if most people don ' t recognize tje names behind the films
, they are bound to recognize the titles
: airplane
!
, top secret
, the naked gun
,
and hot shots to nmae a few
. but
althought the zucker
/ abrahams
/ zucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in 1977
, airplane
! remains the true cornerstone ofthe their work
,
and their directorial debuts
. in the seventies
, disaster films seemed to be at an all time high
. films like earthquake
, the towering inferno
,
and the poseidon adventure weere big hits
. htere was also a serieses about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane
- a series that spanned the entire decade
.
and so
, in 1980
, we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film
. this time the disaster hadnt nothing to do wtih a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean
.
.
. it had to do with bad fish
. airplane
! is the story of ted striker
( robert hays
)
- an ex
- fighter
- pilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make inspite the midst of war led to the death of six
, er
, seven comrades
. unable to stop living in hte past
, ted ' s world fell apart
. he spent his time moving from city to city wihtout ever hvaing a stable job
,
and eventually
, as we begin this film
, is getting dumped by his lover
, flight attendant elaine dickinson
( julie hagerty
)
. in a desperate attempt not to lose her
, ted buys a ticket for the same flight elaine is working
. unfortunately
, she is unsympathetic
and even criticizes ted for following her
, which leaves him wallowing in self
- pity
. in thge midst of it all
, something happens
. someone gets sick
.
then another
.
then another
. soon
, the hwole plane is full of deathly
- ill chicago
- bound people
.
.
.
and whn the pilots get sick
( played by peter graves
, kareem abdul
- jabbar
,
and frank ashmore
)
, who wiull save the day
?
( gee
, i wonder
) ofthe course the main draw here isnt the non
- stop
" whiz
- beng
" comedy
, with a hefty dose ofthe both visual
and spoken gags
.
altough i hadnt seen this movie a few times before
, i was still laughing thru the entire thing
. the most fun character by far is the doctor
, plyed by leslie nielsen
. he ' s a dry
, subtle
, sterotypically straight
- faced doctor that ends uv saying smoe of the funniest lines ofthe the film
. in a film like this
, you ' re not really expecting an elaborate production
, so noe can ' t complain about the amateurish quality
. what you can complain baout is the absolutely annoying johnny
, played by stephen stucker
. this character is pointless
, nauseating
,
and very unfunny
. i don ' t know why he was put in there
,
and i don ' t think anybody will find a good excuse
.
and when the film nears an end
, it slows down quite a bit
, almost getting old
. you gotta give it to a movie thast only runs 88 minutes
and can feel twpo huors long
. aside from that
, airplane
! isnt really a top
- nitch spoof that will likely forever be known as a spoof classic
. it would be a good choice to pop in the vcr with a group of firends
, especially if they haven ' t seen it
.
and if they ask what the plot is
, just tell ' em
" it ' s a synopsis of tghe basic storyline of the film
,
bu that ' s not important right now
.
" if you ' ve seen thte film
, you ' ll understand
