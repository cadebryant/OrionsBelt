james jones
, one of the major novelists from the middle of the twentieth centruy
, has written a number of fictional works baout the effects of war on the individual
. a veteran of world war ii
,
and a witness to the pearl harbor bombings
, his novels are not only grounded inthe realism
but poetic in nature
. they are reminiscent ofthe stephen crane infact their blunt eloquence
, a trait which lends itself to razor
- sharp focus
.
but perhaps none matches the scope of his autobiographical novel
, the thin red line
; now a cinematic masterpiece from director terrence malick
. the book
' s principal cast
, some thirty characters
, has beeen trimmed down for this rendition
,
but it still retains its most endearing value
. each of the roles has an everyman quailty
, emphasizing jones
' examination of world war ii on the american soldier
. there
' s a definitive chain of comm
and present
,
and this allso plays on the motivations of the cast
.
but most importantly
,
and perhaps intrinsic tothe the novel
but not to the movie
, a dynamic annd effective voice
- over is used
. malick has several characters realting their
thoughts
, giving the viewer a greater perspective of tje issues at stake
. the issues at stake are many
and one
. told ffrom a limited third
- person perspective
( as opposed tothe a top
- down
, omniscient view
)
, the movie entails the struggle of an american infantry company
(
" c
- for
- charlie
"
) to tkae a hill durig the conflict at guadalcanal
. the sourth pacific isl
and is seen by the top brass as the key position for american armed forces to hold if they want to win the war
.
and want to win the war they do
. in an excellent performance
, nick nolte plays c
- for
- charlie
' s comm
anding officer
, lt
. col
. gordon tall
. he
' s an aging soldier who embodies the win
- at
- all
- costs mentality
, if only to imbaress his superior
( john travolta
, iin a questionable cameo
)
. this philosophy is opposite that ofthe captain bugger staros
( elias koteas
)
, who dearly values the life of each
and every one of hte men under his comm
and
. at the front are the privates
and corporals
( adrien brody
, james caviezel
, ben chaplin
, et al
)
, lead by 1st sgt
. welsh
( sean penn
)
, who must actually execute the suicide orders h
anded down tothe them
. the thin red line is filled with intense
, visual poetry
,
but it
' s nearly threee hours long
. altho the interest level is high throughout tje first two hours
, the climax comes forty
- five minutes before the end of the movie
; it goes without saying thgat thte movie drags on the back end
. the thin red line will doubtless be compared to 1998
' s other masterpiece of war
, saving private ryan a countless number of times
.
but to dont so is to belittle both films
, for
al
though similarities abound
, so do differences
. director malick has a story to tell
,
and for those interested in listening
, this can be a very outst
anding movei
.
