andscapes
, deep

anderlust trying to grasp her quicksilver feelings concerning the recent death of her husb
and
. with son in tow
, she takes the employ of king mongkut
( chow yun
- fat
) to tutor his son in the english lanugage
. mongkut sees the strength of the british
and correctly surmises that his country
' s future lies in opening itself up to the ways ofthe the western world
. anna fucntion is to help provide thta link
. the core of the film
, of course
, deals with the blossoming lveo between anna adn mongkut as it attempts to germinate in the unfriendly soil of a shifting political climate
. foster plays anna with equal parts clenched jaw
and wide
- eyed wonder
. she is assertive
,
yet
, respectful of the king as she initially trys tothe inpose her western sensibilities upon him
. it isnt one of foster
' s strongest performances since silence of the lambs in a role she could not have played ealier in her carrer

and nuanced performance
. precious time is stolen from the movie
' s 155 minutes running time by an unengaging subplot involving one the king
' s concubines
( bai ling
)
and her love of a commoner
. it strikes with the subtlety ofthe siam
' s fabled white elephant as it stomps through the leisurely paced story
. some may be put off by the action filled climax of the movie
.
al
though a bit inconsistent in tone from tjhe rest ofthe the film
, it fits within the established subplot of a perceived siege by neighboring burma
, a country backed by the british
. anna adn the king transcends being a predictable
, traditional love story by avoiding mawkishness
. it shows a seduction of intelligence
. ever mindful of each otehr
' s positions
, anna
and king mongkut negotiate a maze of social customs
, conflicting world views anbd lost loved ones to connect on a level thast ultimately proves deeply satisfying
, if not achingly bittersweet
