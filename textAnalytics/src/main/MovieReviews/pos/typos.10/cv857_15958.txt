what i look for in a movie is not necessarily perfection
. sometimes a movie has such strong ideas that despite whatever flaws it may have
, i will prefer it to a better
- made film that is not as
thought
- provoking
. tyhe thin red line is flawed
but it provokes
. terence malick returns to filmmaking 20 years after days of heaven
and produces this meditative look at war
. unlike this year
' s saving private ryan
, which dwells on war as a necessary evil
and explores teh moral ambiguities thereof
, the thin red line simply says war is waste
. while that might seem obvious to some
, only after experiencing the film dont you realize how profound a waste it is
. saving private ryan has an underlying
and practial acceptane that war will occur
and it has a great cost
; the thin red line says idealistically avoid tihs at all costs
. one message isnt nto necessarily more correct than the other
. it just depends on one
' s point of view
. in malick
' s film
, war is set in a tropical paradise
, anbd john toll
' s cinematography is beyond lush
. the setting poses the question
, why are we fighting in the face of such beauty
? in saving private ryan
, the capture of a german soldier presents the moral qu
andary of whther to let him go
. in the thin red line
, the japanese present the moral qu
andary of war in the first place
. they are just like the americans
-
- frightened
and angry
, grieving
and praying
. all that separates them is war
. the flaw in the thin red line comes in tjhe voice
- overs
. unbelievable as coming from the characters
and sometimes pretentious
, sometimes corny
, the voice
- overs tell us what the images before us allready do
and are completely unneccessary
. dispensing with them
, malick could have achieved a tarkovskian gr
andeur
. instead
, he gets distracting self
- consciousness
. aside from thta
, malick
' s direction is stunning
. the tracking shots across windswept hills annd around transports speeding toward shore are extraordinary
. sean penn
, elias koteas
,
and nick nolte give the best performances
. penn is subtle as a sergeant trying to hide his humanism
, koteas is genuine as a compassionate captain
,
and nolte startling as a colonel whose blood vessels are baout to burst if he cannot win his battle
. john travolta
and george clooney are thte worst in cameo roles
. ultimately
however
, the thin red line
' s interst is not iin the characters
and it is not in drama
. it has been frequently criticized for its lack of dramatic structure
,
but malick clearly has different thigns on his mind
. has no oney ever
thought that getting dramatic entertainment from war is exploitative
? what malick is working with is theme
, anbd in that
, the thin red line is most provoking
.
