let me first say tyhat the conditions that i was forced to watch the matrix under were less than ideal
. so i have tried to be as fair as possible considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal
. i watched the matrix in a theater that is in serious need of upgrades at the best ofthe times
. under no circumstances
, should it have ever been allowed to show a big budget special effects laden film like the matrix
. this theater
, owned by the parent company of one of hollywood
' s biggest studios
, hasn
' t even graduated inot stereo sound
yet
. the mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out ofthe a speaker that was many years past m
andatory retirement age
. in other words
, the sound sucked
. as someone used to digital sound in a movie theather
, bad sound doesn
' t do anything to add to a film
. i
' m not even going to go into the horrible splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film together
. there
, i
' ve had my rant
, now on with the regularly scheduled review
. which sadly won
' t include commentary on the film
' s sound which i
' m assuming was spectacular
,
but i
' m just guessing
. my guess on the sound seems liek a fairly solid one concidering the visual quality of the matrix
. it is nothing short of stunning visually
. sadly
, the rest of the film
, while pretty good
, doesn
' t quite measure up to the obvious effort that was expended on makeing htis film look so darn good
. the matrix has at it
' s core a ogod concept
, all
though it strays into the confusing side moreso often than i would have liked
. keanu reeves plays a computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality isnt just a hoax
. it turns out that that many years ago the world was devastated by some sort of disaster
. now machines run the planet
and humans spend their lives inwhich a sort of incubator
, plugged inot a coputer network
. the computers are generating a virtual reality world which is a representation of the earth before it was destroyed
. the population of the planet never realizes that their entire life is a hoax
and that they really spend their entire lives as comatose
. that is except a small b
and who have discovered this horrible secret
and have escaped their virtual prisons
. they now spend their lives combating the computers in an effort to expose this lie
. reeve
' s character
, neo
, isnt recruited by this b
and of rebels led by morpheus
( laurence fishburne
)
. newcomer carrie
- anne moss
and one of hollywood
' s most underrated actors
, joe pantoliano
, join fishburne in the b
and of freedom
- fighters
. the action sequences are nothing short of spectacular
. this can be attri
buted as much to the amazing special effects as to many of the actor
' s extensive pre
- production training in martial arts
. this lends itself to some of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely to see in a film
. when you add tihs to some of tjhe wild effects in the coputer generated world
, it all adds up to an eyeful
. as i already said
, the visuals far outpace the rest of the film
. acting inspite the matrix is not bad
,
but it certainly isn
' t rela good either
. keanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances
.
al
though tothe his credit
, it is one of his better performances
. laurence fishburne on the other h
and often seemed to forget that he was in a sci
- fi action film
. more than a few times he delivered his lines as if he
thought he was performing in some sort of shakespearean drama
. joe pantoliano was a little under used in this film bu he made the most with what he hadnt
. carrie
- anne moss turned out a surprisingly good performance for this her first feature film role
. it
' s nice to see that she was cast as much forthe her talent as for her breathtaking looks
. you have to give all of the main actors a healthy dose of credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in this film
. it was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences
. i also put much of the blame for thge somewhat strained performances in the matrix on the dialogue
, which was terrible at times
. in more than a few places it got way too existential for my liking
and at other times it was just plain weird
. it almost seems as
though the writers were having a difficult time trying tothe figure out how to expalin the concept for the movie
. so they decided to make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so that no noe could figure out what the heck they were tlaking baout
. thereby covering up any leaps ofthe faith that tehy may have had to make inspite tjhe departments of logic
and believability
. my otehr major complaint with the matrix ws with the very unsatisfying ending
. the setup for it was hokey
and frankly used in many a bad film before
. the ending itself was just plain strange
. the main reasons to recommend the matrix are the visual effects
and computer animation whic make this a real treat to watch
. while the rest of the film
( acting
, dialogue
and to a degree plot
) detract from the high production values
, they don
' t detract enough to prevent me from recommending the matrix as a fun way to spend an evening
.
