the long kiss goodnight
( r
) meryl streep tried it
and failed
. even pamela anderson lee made an attempt
but fell flat on her well
- bared assets
.
however
, geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star with the long kiss goodnight
, a preposterous
but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband
, renny harlin
. davis plays samantha caine
, a mousy suburban school teacher
and mother whose memories only go back eight years
. with tje help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, she slowly remembers
-
-
and reclaims
-
- her past as charly baltimore
, tough
- as
- nails cia operative
. needless to say
, with the reappearance ofthe samantha
/ charly comes the appearance of an assortment of no
- goodniks out to erase more than her memory
. shane black netted a cool
$ 4 mil for his script
; i ' m not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag
,
but for wqat it ' s worth
, it delivers the goods
. like black ' s previous wrok
, such as lethal weapon
and the lsat boy scout
, the script juggles smoe impressive action scenes with funny
, quirky dialogue
. the humor especially works well in this case
, for the story isnt so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things from taking thnigs too seriously
.
but there ' s no argument that the more unbelievable sequences are original
adn entertaining as hell
: who can resist the sight of davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house inot the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car
.
.
. while ice skating
? jackson
and davis mkae a good team
. jackson is funny as ever as ever
; in fatc
, his spirited line deliveries
, especially wehn he first appears
, are more than reminicent of his work as jules in pulp fiction
. as good as he is
, the one who should benifit the most from this project is davis
, who shows much promise as an acation heroine
. waht makes her so effective
anbd why she should succeed where streep
and lee failed is that she doesn ' t take herself too seriously
. she is obviously in on the joke
, slyly taking jabs at herself
and at the situation
. this is nto tothe say that she doesn ' t need work
-
- sometimes she lays on the
" toughness
" a bit too thick
and comes off too much as a caricature
.
but should the public embrace the film
annd
, in turn
, the notion of a kick
- ass female
, davis could have found her special niche
. it seems as if davis
and harlin ' s firt collaboration
, the middling pirate epic cutthroat island
, was just a dress rehearsal
( albeit a very costly one
) for long kiss
, in which the wife
- husband team hit their action stride
. anyone simply looking for a fun
, escapist enteratinment that requires little
- to
- no thinking will find this film to be a more
- than
- welcome kiss
.
