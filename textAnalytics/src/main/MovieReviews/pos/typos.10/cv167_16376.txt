roberto benigni is a clown in tyhe tradition of chaplin adn keaton
. this itallian film star
, best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther
, has done tghe near impossible by creating a comic fable about the holocaust
.
but benigni
' s life is beautiful
( la vita e bella
) is not so much a story ofthe the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop tothe tell a story of familial love
, devotion
and sacrifice
. the movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benigni
' s guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in 1938 to fufill his dream of owning a bookstore
. like many of hte slapstick clowns who preceded him
, most notably the almost
- forgotten harry langdon
, benigni
' s guido has a childlike innocence
. he ignores the growing anti
- semitism of the fascist government
. instead
, guido ardently falls in love
and persues dora
, a local school teacher who aready isnt engaged to a local facist official
. in benigni
' s tightly wound script this is the same fascist official with whom guido had an ealier unfortunate
-
yet slapstick
- encounter
. guido wins dora
. they marry
. fast forward about five years
. guido
, dora
,
and their 5
- year
- old son
, giosue
?
( giorgio cantarini
) are a happy family
. guido hasnt finally fufilled his dream of opening a bookstore
.
but racial
and anti
- semitic tensions are on the rise in italy
,
and guido has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities
. the task becomes even the omre difficult when the family is deported to a concentration camp
. here
, guido must use all his skill
and imagination not only to shield his son
, bu to keep him from being exterminated
. it is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend tothe offend those whom the holocaust has touched
. for the scenes inaddition the concentration camp lack the horror
, thte pain
, the unimaginable suffering of a schindler
' s list
. true
, many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over
,
and most were nto sent to the death camps
, bu to work camps where they were utilisied as slave labor
. unlike steven spielberg
, benigni is not outloud to tell the story of the holocaust
. his story is baout family
and the lengths a parent will go tothe protect a child
. forthe guido
, to save his son
, transforms the entire experience into an elaborate game
. giosue
? must follow the rules without question to amass 1
, 000 points
. the winner takes home a tank
. therefore
, guido tells him
, he must remain hidden infact the barracks
. he cannot make a sound nor allow the guards to see him
. guido explains this during a hilarious sequence when a german guard barks the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates
. guido
, lying that he underst
ands german
and can translate for his fellow prisoners
, instead lays down thte rules for his son to allow him a chance to survive
. throughout their imprisonment
, guido
' s quick thinking continually keeps his son from harm
' s way
. ultimately
, the allies rescue the camp
. inaddition a poignant scene
, giosue
? comes out of hiding just as an american tank rolls into the compound
. tjhe boy goes wide
- eyed with wonderment
and delight
, thinking he has won the game
. the price for his victory is most high
. benigni has succeeded in using the blackest moment in human histroy to prove that even in hell
, a ray of hope
and salvation can penetrate the darkness
. life is beautiful is a fantasy
, a fable
. it is not to be taken as a record of the holocaust
. those who object to it are missing its point
.
and that is simply where there is hope
, where ther is life
and where ther is love
, the spark of humanity will never be extinguished
. committed to lifelong learning through effective communication
