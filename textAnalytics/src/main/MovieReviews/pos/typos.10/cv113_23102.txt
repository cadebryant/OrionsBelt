the sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate the jews of europe is allmost incomprehensible
. people may make documentaries about it for another hundred years
and still not underst
and the organized
, methodical hatred
. five concentration camp survivors from the last days of world war ii tell their stories in the last days
, thte first documentary from steven spielberg
' s survivors of the shoah visual history foundation
. the five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry
. as the introduction explains
, even as germany started to lose thge war
, the nazis stepped up their extermination of the jews in europe
. in 1944
, hungary had the last big population of jews within germany
' s reach
,
and they became the last target of hitler
' s
" final solution
.
" each of the five tells his or her story
. their stories are intercut chronologically
, starting from normal life in pre
- war hungary
. they recall the nazi invasion of hungary
, being sent to
" work
" camps
and their realization that they weere actually in death camps
. they recall their horrible
, precarious lives in auschwitz
and buchenwald
; the deaths of their family
and friends
; theri loss of hope
. each recalls his or her unfathomable
, eventual liberation
.
and finally
, the last days shows their cathartic
, pained
, modern
- day return to their old homes
and the camps
. needless tothe say
, thier stories are horrifying
, amazing
,
and emotionally draining
. by themselves
, the stories would be forceful testaments
,
but by cutting them in parallel
, their impact is multipled by five
. the last days is a talking
- heads sytle documentary
-
- it
' s mostly pictures of people telling their stories
, intercut with period photographs
and newsreel footage
. in this kind of movie it
' s almost impossible to get archival picturesk fomr the same time
and place being discussed on
- screen
,
but director james moll made a better effort thna most at finding specific
, or at least relevant
, images to go with his subjects
' narration
. tje liner notes
( one of the many nice features of this dvd
) indicate that there is some never
- before
- seen historical footage in the last days
. it
' s not clear hwihc scene it is
. it could be one ofthe twpo that i hadn
' t seen before
, both powerful
. one is rare color footage
, shot by an american
, of piles of victims in cattle cars
. there is something jarring
, something unsettling about seing the pictures in color
, when so much of the footage from world war ii is in balck anbd white
. another segment shows walking skeletons
; survivors who are so starved that they hardly look human anymore
. there has been a glut ofthe holocaust movies
and i was skeptical that a new documentary would have anything new to say
.
but by focusing on hungarian jews during the last days of the war
, moll told a spicific part of tje sotry in a newyorker way
, in greater detail
.
and i
' m glad he did because his carefull filmmaking st
ands up well compared to other movies on tghe same subject
. the transfer to dvd is rich
and beautiful
. x
- mozilla
- status
: 0009f words for a holocaust documentary
,
but soem of the interviews take place in europe in lite spring
, when skies are blue anbd trees are green
. also
, the movie was shot onthe 35mm film
(
and not video
!
)
, so the richness
and detail are impeccable
. the dvd
' s features are plentiful
and well
- chosen
. ther is a theatrical trailer for the movie
, which is a great introduction to the subject marter
. there are baout fifty still photos
, both from the production crew
and from the private collections of teh survivors
. also
, the disc has two complete versions of the movei
( widescreen
and full screen
)
, both on the same side
. one of the more interesting dvd features is an outtake segment for each of the survivors
( plus one for the crew
)
. you
' d think outtakes owudl be inappropriate in a holocaust documentary
, bu they
' re not bloopers
. instead
, they are solid
, moving segments that were probably cutted fomr the film onyl for lenght
. one of them continues a confrontation that was onyl touched on lightly in the film
. renee firestone
( noe of the five
) spoke on camera with dr
. hans m
? nch
, a german doctor who ran the medical clinic at auschwitz
. firestone wass aggressive
, questioning the doctor about what his children
thought
. the doctor was evasive anbd clearly uncomfortable
. another of the outtakes showed bill basch saying a prayer for his dead friends at auschwitz
. he ends his prayer by saying
"
.
.
. forgive me for surviving
.
" it
' s ambitious to shoot a documentary on 35mm film
. it
' s ambitious to mkae it on a subject that has saturated cable
, television
,
and movies
. it
' s ambitious to make it 54 years aftter the events it covers
.
but tghe last days h
andles all these potential obstacles very well
. it
' s only fitting tht the dvd
, iwth its wealth of intresting
and relevant features
, would also be ambitious adn successful
.
