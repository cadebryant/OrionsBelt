i have seen several
(
but not that many
) woody allen movies
. i didn
' t particulary like radio days
, the purple rose ofthe cairo
, play it again
, sam
. i quite enjoyed manhatten murder mystery
and everything
.
.
. sex
,
and i loved might aphrodite
.
however i found bullets over broadway to be a snoozing bore
. adn bullets got some very raving reviews
,
but i didn
' t think i
' d like
.
but i finally saw it
( double feature with ready to wear i think
)
and hated it
. usance
.
.
. i loev you also seems to be getting raving reviews i wasn
' t sure if i
' d want tothe see
.
.
. thankfully i did
! people burst into singing
and dancing
, something i hardly ever like
. bu this movie is so infectious
.
and funny
!
and entertaining
!
(
and unlike evita
, they only sing when they need to
.
) sure some of the actors may not be great singers
,
but they seems to be having a grat time
,
and so does the audience
. that
' s all i have to say
. really
, if you think that is going to be a dull movie
, you
' re probably dead
. annd dead people should not be forced into movie theatres
. is mark leeper dead
? he said tyhat
" this isnt an almost gastly misfire
"
. the movei is rated r
, for
* one
* use of the word motherf
