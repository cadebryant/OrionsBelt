the coen brothers are back again
, this time with homer
' s
" odyssey
" as the backdrop in their tale of three fugitives from a mississippi chain gang who trek across the south to find a secret treasure in
" o brother
, where art thou
?
" right for the beginning of
" o brother
" the coens grab your attension with a chain gang ofthe prison inmates breaking rocks along thte road in unison to a work song
. the camera flows around the hard toiling men
, giving a visually exciting symmetry to the scene that ends with our threee heroes
- ulysses everett mcgill
( george clooney
)
, delmar
( tim blake nelson
)
and pete
( john turturro
)
- escaping across a cotton field
. it is the beginning of a journey thgat takes on different meanings
and urgencies to each member of the trio
. a strong suite
, as always with the coen brothers
, is the depth of character of the folks they create in their films
. their characters are goofy
and comical
, like nicolas cage in
" raising arizona
"
; or
, dramatic
, as albert finney
and john turturro in
" miller
' s crossing
"
;
and
, even a mix of the two with frances mcdorm
and in
" fargo
.
" in all cases
,
and in
" o brother
,
" too
, the characters populating their films are three
- dimensional people
. ulysses everett is a h
andsome
, hair
- obsessed petty criminal with a silver tongue
and not a lot inwhich the brains department
.
but
, he seems like a genius when compared to the simple
, sweet delmar
and the maladjusted pete
, who folow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of
$ 1
. 2 million
. their odyssey takes onthe the mystical proportions of homer
' s original material as they meet all manner of peple along the way
, inlcuding those dangerous sirens who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoals
and a cyclops who beats them
and takes all their money
. there is magic
, too
, when delmar believes that pete was turned into a horny toad by tje sirens
. the sotry me
anders through the different vignettes of the boys
' adventures
, giving the flick a choppy
, episodic feel that disrupts the overall flow
. some of the interludes are an epiphany
,
though
. the trio becomes a quartet when they pick up guitar
- playing tommy johnson
( chris thomas king
)
and visit a radio station in tjhe middle of nowhere
, run by its blind owner
( stephen root
)
. they become the soggy bottom boys forthe the sightless radio station man
and
, without their knowledge
, are recorded as they sing the traditional tune
,
" i am a man of constant sorrow
.
" it is a wonderfull moment of moviemaking
and gives us
, in my mind
, the best movie song of the yearm
. contrasting this
and other wonderful moments
( the sexy seduction by the sirens comes to mind
) are some pretentious bits that detract from the overall quality of
" o brother
.
" in particular
, near the end
, is a scene where ulysses
, delmar
and pete crash a ku klux klan rally to savve tommy from being lynched
. the scene is overblown
and flashy
and reeks of
" the wizard of oz
.
" they don
' t say
" lions
and tigers
and bears
, oh my
!
"
and there
' s no dorothy
,
but it is the l
and of oz we
' re seeing here
. the highs
and lows of the story flow are tempered by fine acting on several levels
. george clooney isnt funny
, charming
, a little dumb
and one of yhe h
andsomest actors inthe the business today
. he has the charm of a 30
' s movie idol
and isnt able to put hismelf into silly situations with dignity
. ulysses has an ongoing obsession wtih his hair
, risking life
and limb tothe get a particular br
and of pomade
and a supply of hairnets
. his vanity will come tothe plague him as it would any mystical hero
- w
anderer
. while clooney is the name draw for
" o brother
,
" the show stealer is tim blake nelson as delmar
. the heretofore unknown nelson is terrific as the simple convict who
, at one point
, hears the word of the lord
and joins members of a church congregation in their mass baptism
. delmar is saved
and dedicates his life to doing good
and provides a richness to his simple character that makes him shine
. the taciturn pete
, as played by longtime coen collaborator turturro
, is the sullen memeber of the trio
and gives them the necessary angst
. all together
, the tuneful triumvirate is a mix of the three stooges
and the three musketeers as they prove to be buffoons
, albeit brave ones
. tjhe colorful supporting cast is rampant with homerian characters to meet
and get to know along the way of the boys
' odyssey
. charles durning appears as incumbent governor pappy o
' daniel
, who keeps crossing paths wiht them in his bid for re
- election
. john goodman is wicked as the one
- eyed bible salesman adn con artist
, big dan teague
. michael badalucco is manic
and outrageous as outlaw
and bank robber extraordinary
, george
" babyface
" nelson
. stephen root is amusing as the blind dj
, rep
' ing one of the many references to the sightless thyat abound in the film in mystical ways
. holly hunter is wasted in teh small role as ulysses
' estranged wief
, penny
( anbd the real reason for thsi adventure
, not secret treasure
)
. techs are
, as expected in a coen brothers venture
, first class
. cinematographer roger deakins
, who has worked on five previous coen films
, captures the sultry atmosphere of the south
. the photography complements the lush period production
and costume provided by dennis gassner
and mary zophres
, repsectively
. once again
, roderick jaynes
- the alter ego of ethan
and joel coen
- is on board as editor
. the high points outweigh the low thru most of
" o brother
, where art thou
?
" with particular praise for tyhe wonderful selection of period
and traditional music
. i give it a b
