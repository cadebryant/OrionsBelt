up until about a year ago
, john travolta
' s career consisted of those
" look who
' s talking
" movies
( notice how they never called them look who
' s talented
) anbd the 1991 bomb shout
( which was bad enough to make most people scream
)
.
but somewhere along the line
, travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction annd his career soared once again
. weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back inaddition 1978 would experience fame
and fortune once again
, while barry
, robin
and maurice gibb could do noone better than a 1993 straight
- to
- the
- cutout
- bin album aptly named
" size isn
' t everything
"
(
and ofthe course
, they learned that sales are everything
)
.
but now travolta
' s bcak on the hollywood scene once again
,
and i think we all know why
. four words
: contract with the devil
. anbd this has nothing to do with newt gingrich
' s
" contract whith america
.
" no
, satan is much more humane
. anyway
, yes
, travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld
. how do i know
? i own the document in question
. amazing waht yuo can buy at those collector
' s shops for a fewd hundred dollars
, isn
' t it
? git shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction
, with travolta as crime minion chili palmer
. he goes to collect some of thge mafia
' s money from a b
- grade director
( gene hackman
)
and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game
and into the movie game
. sure
, a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood
,
but i guess thta
' s beside the point
. palmer is determined to get hackman
' s next project made
, so he sets out tothe convince big star martin weir
( danny devito
) to star in the movie
, bringing along down
-
and
- outloud horror actress karen flores
( rene russo
)
, who has already had affairs with hackman
and devito
. it doesn
' t take a las vegas odds
- maker to predict that she
and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well
, after the customary sexual tension
and denial
, which has been used in every comedy from
" who
' s the boss
?
" tothe speechless
. it works in this case
, unlike
" who
' s the boss
?
"
al
though it
' s intresting tothe note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also
. complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackman
' s other films
and want in on this one too
, along with travolta
' s mob boss trying to track him down for defecting
. get shorty is by no means on the same levle as pulp fiction
, despite the obvious similarities
. this movie doesn
' t have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction
but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies i
' ve seen this year
( yes
, even better tahn halloween vi
)
. get shorty is my kind of movie
, one that mixes intelligent humor whith action
and violence
. i
' m definitely going to have to check out the novel it ws based on
. are you getting this
, shorty
?
