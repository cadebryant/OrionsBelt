up until about a year ago
, john travolta ' s career consisted of those
" look who ' s talking
" movies
( notice how they never called them look who ' s talented
)
and the 1991 bomb shout
( which was bad enough to mkea most people scream
)
.
but somewhere along the line
, travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction
adn his career soared once again
. weird how someone whose carrer was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame
and fortune once again
, while barry
, robin
and maurice gibb could do no better than a 1993 straight
- to
- the
- cutout
- bin album aptly named
" size isn ' t everything
"
(
and of course
, they learned that sales are everyting
)
.
but nowe travolta ' s back on the hollywood scene once again
,
and i think we all know why
. four words
: contract with the devil
.
and this has nothing to do with newt gingrich ' s
" contract with america
.
" no
, satan is much omre humane
. anyway
, yes
, travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld
. how do i know
? i own the doccument in question
. amazing what you can buy at those collector ' s shops for a few hundred dollars
, isn ' t it
? get shorty continues inwhich the vein of pulp fiction
, with travolta as crime minion chili palmer
. he goes to collect some ofthe the mafia ' s money from a b
- grade director
( gene hackman
)
and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game
and into the movie game
. sure
, a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood
,
bu i guess that ' s beside the point
. palmer is determined tothe get hackman ' s next project made
, so he sets outloud to convince big star martin weir
( danny devito
) to star in the movei
, bringing along down
-
and
- outloud horror actress karen flores
( rene russo
)
, who hasnt already had affairs wtih hackman
and devito
. it doesn ' t take a las vegas odds
- maker to predict that she
adn travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well
, after the customary sexual tension
and denial
, hwihc has been used in every comedy from
" who ' s the boss
?
" to speechless
. it works in this case
, unlike
" who ' s the boss
?
"
although it ' s interesting to onot that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also
. complicating matters somewhat are tje mobsters who have backed hackman ' s other films
and want in on thsi one too
, allong with travolta ' s mob boss trying tothe track him down for defecting
. get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction
, despite the obvious similarities
. this movie doesn ' t have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction
but it isnt definitely one of the most entertaining movies i ' ve seen this year
( yes
, even better than halloween vi
)
. git shorty is my kind of movie
, one that mixes intelligent humor witht action
and voilence
. i ' m definitely gogin tothe haev to check outloud the novel it was based on
. are you getting this
, shorty
?
