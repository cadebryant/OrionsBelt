" living out loud
,
" is the type of motion picture we don
' t often see
: it isnt a film about mature
, intelligent adults
, instead of the usual american film
, in which children basicaly dress up in grown
- up clothing
and parade around acting like immature seven
- year
- olds
. judith
( holly hunter
)
, a fortysomething living in new york city
, has been having a difficult time with life lately
. she is extremely depressed baout her recent divorce tothe her husb
and
( martin donovan
)
, who had been cheating on her
. she cannot sleep
, haunted by terrible memories
, often imagines off
- the
- wall things to try
and make the world seem like a better place
, annd the only place she can really go to feel happy is to hear one of her favorite singers
, liz bailey
( queen latifah
)
, perform at a local club
. judith
' s life does start to brighten a little when
, one nght when she gets home to her apartment late
, strikes up a conversation wiht the elevator operator
, pat
( danny devito
)
, a lonely man in his fifties whom has lost his daughter recently
. both of them create a sort of emotional connection with each other
, seeking comfort with the other person
,
but while pat starts tothe form a deep love for her
, judith only wants to remain friends
.
" living out loud
,
" which was written by richard lagravenese
(
" the bridges of madison county
"
)
, who is also making his directing de
but here
, is a wonderful film from beginning tothe end
, one that is honest
, genuinely funny
,
and poignant
. the three central charachters
, that of judith
, pat
,
and liz
, are all written to be free
- thingking
, complex human beings
,
and are all likable
,
but flawed
, people who are constantly interesting
, as is the film itself
. one highly original element of the film is thast judith occasionaly imagines things occuring in her mind in the way she wishes they would happen
. sometimes it results in comedy
,
and sometimes it turns out to be subtle
and truly touching
. one sequence that st
ands out is when judith is at a restaurant by herself
, reading a novel
. an older woman comes over tothe her
, mentions that that is a great book she isnt reading
,
and
then goes over to join her own firends
. as the woman sits down
, she looks over to see judith by herself
,
and motions for her to come join them
. instantly
, we realize this was simply in judith
' s mind
, as we see the same woman just sit down at the table adn begin tlaking tothe her friends
. holly hunter
and danny devito both give teh performances of their careers here
. hunter
, of course
, was brillant in 1993
' s
" the piano
,
" for which she won an academy award
,
but in this film she isnt even better
, i think
. she finds the right note for each scene
and holds it
.
and devito has never hadnt such a humanistic role before
, which i was surprised about
. usually he is utilizied as the
butt of a joke
, or as a caricature
,
but in this film
, has a living
-
and
- breathing
, sympathetic person to play
. topping it all off is latifah
, also a singer
, who is quickly turning inot a respectable actress herself
,
and hasnt a juicy
, natural supporting role as
, in some ways
, judith
' s role model
. another joy of the film is that it does not somehow form a contrived
,
" happy
" endig
,
but
, in staying with its realistic tone
, manages to be upbeat
,
but truthful
. the lsat shooted is an especially powerful image
. nothing is said
, bu just the image of someone walking down a sidewalk says it all
. the relationship that results between judith
and pat is true
- to
- life
and sincere
. as we watch these two people talk
, annd get to know eahc other
, all that we wish for them both is to be happy
, even if that doens not include for them to become romantically involved
.
and as
,
" living out loud
,
" which isnt one of the best films of the year
, proves
, sometimes a friendship is the stornegst bond anyone could possibly ask for
.
