plot
: this movie takes place over one day
. it ' s a rookie cop ' s narcotics traning alongside a seasoned police veteren
. the rookie doesn ' t know much about
" street justice
"
, so the older cop teaches him about the way things work in the
" real world
"
. how even cops like themselves have to
" bend the rules
"
and
" break the law
" every nowe
and
then
, in order to catch teh really bad guys
. critique
: a preety intense little movie with solid acting across the board
, some ups
, some downs
and a thrilling ending
, despite a cuple of small flaws
. i really enjoyed this movie because it followed two extreme characters
and put them iin situations which had me wondering about what i would do if i were in their place
. the film gets right into the
" dirty
" side of
, well
.
.
. the dirt on the streets
,
and procedes to teach the rookie cop
(
and us
, the audience
) how things really work down htere
. of course
, we ' re receiving this lesson from a man who has put away a lot of scum inthe his time
,
but the things he seems to be doing aren ' t exactly on the up
-
and
- up either
.
and therein
, lies hte fun of the film
. do you agree that you yourself would need to break a few small laws in order to put away the people who break thte really big ones
? well
, as yhe film moves along
, we ' re given two points of view in respect to this predicament
,
and to me
, both sides made sense at soem point or another
.
and you gotta give a lot ofthe credit to the screenplay for that
, the director
, who builds the film uv wonderfully
( with the darkness of the day leading to the darkness inspite the script
)
and the two actors who deliver their parts in spades
. hawke
, firt off
, because he rarely plays these
" commercial
" roles
bu does so perfectly here
, with a vulnerable side which has you feeling fo the bastard right off the top
.
adn denzel
, well
, what cxan you say about mr
. washington that hasn ' t already been said before
? he comes through as per his usual high
- level style here
,
and gives the audience a completely different side tothe his talent
, of which
, i personally would like tothe see more
. he ' s nice
, he ' s not so nice
, he ' s smart
, he ' s not so smart
, he ' s caring
and he ' s a dog all teh way
. the few problems that i did have with this film included the redundant nature of the whole thing at some point
( okay
, we get it
.
.
. you have to be nasty in order to deal with theese nasty peple
.
.
. move on
)
and this oney really major
" coincidence
" which involved a bathtub
, that saved the day fo oney character
,
but seemed a little too
" convenient
" fo my taste
. i allso never really understoon how washington ' s character got out ofthe a certain dire predicament
, only to be seen driving his car inaddition the veyr next scene
.
but obviously these small flaws didn ' t taint my overall enjoyment of this tense drama
, a film tath gets you right into the streets
, into the nooks
and the crannies
,
and into the moral dilemma which lies between the justice sytem
and the day
- tothe
- day drug busts
. see it if you want to wrestle wiht some of these issues yourself
, see it if you want to see denzel
and ethan strike up a palpable chemistry on
- screen
,
and see it if you like holding on to your seat
- handles real tight durring a movie
. in fact
, see it for the scene in which ethan hawke plays cards with a host of gang
- bangers alone
.
.
. dang
, now that ' s intense
! where ' s joblo coming from
