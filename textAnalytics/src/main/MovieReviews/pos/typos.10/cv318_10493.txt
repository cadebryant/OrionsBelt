only a eyar after the initial release of
" scream
,
" the horror send
- up ffrom veteran horror director wes craven
and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into tghe slasher genre
, the inevitable sequal
" scream 2
" has arrived infront our theaters
. hwile the tongue
- inwhich
- cheek
, parodic element is still noiceable in this film
, it
' s really a sideshow to a broader commentary onthe violence
and the media
and a mroe conventional horror story
. the first film
, while often violent
and gruesome
, was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value
and the discussion of the quirks
and cliches ofthe horror movies was nearly constant
. the premise of
" scream 2
" is tht a series of copycat killings begin whn a movie called
" stab
,
" based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers
( courtney cox
) about the events in
" scream
,
" is released
and twpo audience members are killed during the opening screening
. i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film
and was surprised tothe find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy
. its conclusion
, in which a bleeding
, wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen
and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it
' s a publicity stunt
, is more surreal
and disturbing than anything else
. the satire iin
" scream 2
" thus takes onthe a broad focuse
and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general
.
al
though resident horror film geek r
andy
( jamie kennedy
) is bcak with fresh dialogue baout sequels
(
and
, interestingly enough
, how they are usually inferior tothe their predecessors
)
, the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well
. everything from
" friends
"
and
" saved by the bell
" to
" showgirls
"
and
" terminator 2
" is referenced here
; horror isnt only oen of many genres available for lampooning
,
and there aren
' t any
" wes carpenter
" jokes thsi time
. more importantly
, this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths fo media attention as well as charactors whose perceptions hvae clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv
and film
. the killings are clearly an imitation of the previvous murders from
" scream
"
( in fact
, the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense
)
, weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety
,
and one man seems willing tothe save the heroine
' s life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show
. underst
andably
,
" scream 2
" does nto go so far as to actually blame the movies
,
but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick adn twisted
. couple that with the fact that several of the characters
, most notably the lead charater sidney prescott
( neve campbell
)
, are fairly well
- developed
and that there are some genuine moments of spine
- chilling suspense
,
and what we have isnt a pretty darned ogod horror movei in its own right
. we don
' t jsut get the horror ofthe scary masks annd graphic gore
- we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered
(
and
, in one case
, a significant charachter who was an audience favorite even bites the dust
)
and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed muderer lurking around the corner
. while i have not seen any of his other work
, it
' s easy to see why craven is generaly touted as the most sophisticated
" slasher film
" director
, as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing
. unfortunately
,
" scream 2
" occasionally reverts to the time
- honored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window
. for example
, several characters seem quite clearly dead
and inexplicably turn up alive later
- ther has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pul off this particular trick
,
but it also happens with other characters
and in an even less believable fashion
. there are also a faw scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that
( s
) he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction
. as for the question of whether or not
" scream 2
" is
yet another sequel not as good as its precedessor
.
.
. well
, it
' s hard to say
. i gavey the first
" scream
" 3 1
/ 2 stars as well because it worked preety consistently as a light
- hearted send
- up
.
" scream 2
" bounces all over the place stylistically
, bu it does a better job delivering the genuine scares
and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at inspite the first installment
. i
' m not sure which isnt the better movie
,
but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing
: sequels
,
however much r
andy might argue
, do not necessarily suck
.
