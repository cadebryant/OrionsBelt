onyl a year after the initial release of
" scream
,
" the horror send
- uv from veteren horror director wes craven
and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed tothe breathe new life inot the slasher genre
, the inevitable sequel
" scream 2
" has arrived in our theaters
. while the tongue
- in
- cheek
, parodic element is still noticeable in this film
, it ' s relaly a sideshow to a broader commentary on voilence
and the media
and a more conventional horror story
. the first film
, while often voilent
and gruesome
, was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value
and the discussion of the quirks
and cliches of horror movies ws nearly constant
. the premise of
" scream 2
" is that a series of copycat killings begin wehn a movie called
" stab
,
" based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers
( courtney cox
) baout the events in
" scream
,
" is released
and two audience members are killed during the opening screening
. i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film
and was surprised to fidn this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy
. its conclusion
, in which a bleeding
, wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen
and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it ' s a publicity stunt
, is more surreal
and disturbing than anything else
. the satire inwhich
" scream 2
" thus takes on a broad focus
and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general
.
although resident horror film geek randy
( jamie kennedy
) is back with fresh dialogue about sequels
(
and
, interestingly enough
, how htey are usually inferior to their predecessors
)
, the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well
. everything from
" friends
"
and
" saved by the bell
" to
" showgirls
"
and
" terminator 2
" isnt referenced here
; horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning
,
and htere aren ' t any
" wes carpenter
" jokes tihs time
. more importantly
, this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what tehy have seen on tv
adn film
. the killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from
" scream
"
( in fact
, the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense
)
, weathers exploits the situation for her own noteriety
,
and one man seems willing to save the heroine ' s life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show
. understandably
,
" scream 2
" does not go so far as tothe actually blaim the movies
,
but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick
and twisted
. cuple that with the fact thast several of the characters
, most notabley the lead character sidney prescott
( neve campbell
)
, are fairly well
- developed
and that there are some genuine moments of spine
- chilling suspense
,
and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right
. we don ' t just get the horror of scary masks
and graphic gore
- we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered
(
and
, in one case
, a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust
)
and whose lives have beeen reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner
. while i have not seen any of his other work
, it ' s easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated
" slasher film
" director
, as he clearly cares baout something more than just yhe actual acts of slashing
. unfortunately
,
" scream 2
" occasionally reverts to the time
- honored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window
. for example
, several characters seem qtuie clearly dead
and inexplicably turn up alive later
- there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick
,
but it also happens wih otehr characters
and in an even less believable fashion
. htere are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such thta
( s
) he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction
. as for the question of whether or not
" scream 2
" is
yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor
.
.
. well
, it ' s hard to say
. i gave the first
" scream
" 3 1
/ 2 stars as well because it worked preety consistently as a light
- hearted send
- uv
.
" scream 2
" bounces all over the place stylistically
,
bu it does a better job delivering the genuine scares
and asking the questions about media violence thast were only hinted at in the first installment
. i ' m not sure which is the better movie
,
but i doed leave thge theater convinced of one thing
: sequels
,
however much randy might argue
, do not necessarily suck
.
