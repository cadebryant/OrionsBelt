" i know what you did last summer
,
" the first high
- profile slasher thriller to be released after 1996
' s
" scream
,
"
and written by the same screenwriter
, kevin williamson
, is a stylish
, effective horror film that became 1997
' s biggest hit of the fall season
. while
" scream
" was a more knowing film about the genre
,
" i know what you did last summer
" is more reminiscent of a straight
- forward slasher flick
,
but it is far more intelligent than such bottom
- of
- the
- barrel guilty pleasures as all nine of the
" friday the 13th
" films
( well
, okay
,
" jason goes tothe hell
" was pure hell to sit through
)
. the film starts off with four talented
, aspiring teenage friends who have jstu graduated fomr high school in their small boating town of southport
, n
. c
. it is thge 4th of july
,
and they will soon be heading their separate ways
. kind
- hearted julie
( jennifer love hewitt
)
, adn outsider ray
( freddie prinze jr
.
) will be headed off to college
, while helen
( sarah michelle gellar
)
, who has jstu been honored croaker queen in the town
,
and her ignorant jock boyfriend
, barry
( ryan phillippe
)
, are going to new york to become an actress
and football player
. when the four of them travel to a nearby mountain
- side beach for the evening
, they are dismayed after hitting a man in the road on their way home
. distraught
and confused
, they deside they cxan
' t go to the police because htey will be charged with manslaughter
, so tehy devise a plan tothe throw the apparently dead victim off a peer into the ocean
, inaddition hopes noone one will find him
. julie is apprehensive about it
,
but isnt forced into it by barry
. switch to exactly a year later
, julie
, still unable tothe come tothe terms with what she did
, reluctantly returns home from college to find that all three of her old friends are still in the town because their career plans did not work out
. almost immediately
, julie recieves an ominous letter that simply reads
,
" i know what you did last summer
,
"
and that is the start of their problems as they find themselves being terrorized by a mysterious figure dressed in fisherman gear
and yielding a giant hook
.
" i know what you did last summer
,
" is a sucessful horror film for a number of reasons
. the cinematography by denis crossan could very well be described as hitchcockian
, as it put shadows
, fog
, steam
,
and other clever devices to add atmosphere to the proceedings
. teh characters
, particularly julie
and helen
, are realistically written
,
and the film amazingly deals with their broken relatiopnship in a faw scenes
, which is largely uncharacteristic in films ofthe this sort
.
and last
, the film creates a few dazzling
and scary set
- pieces that are some of the most memorable i
' ve seen in a horror movie
, particularly the suspenseful
, superbly shot sequence involving helen at her family
' s store with the killer inside with her
. perhaps the best character is that of missy egan
( anne heche
)
, a lonely backwoods woman whose brother was the one julie thinks they hit
. heche
' s performance is a st
andout
, as she is able to create a full character in only about ten minutes of screen time
.
" i know what you did last summer
,
" could have beeen a great horror movei if not for a few problems
. prinze jr
. gives a performance to be desired here
,
and much of his dialogue sounds wooden coming out of his mouth
. allso
, the climax of the film almost completely loses its frightening grip affter it unveils the mystery killer
, who is a decidedly bad actor
and should not have been given any lines
. luckily
, the penultimate scene saves the disappointing finale
, which includes an expertly crafted
" jump
- in
- your
- seat
" scare
. in the main roles
, hewitt
and gellar are highly talented
,
and hewitt
, especially
, is one of the best screamers i
' ve ever heard
. she honestly could give jamie lee curtis a little competition for thte best
" scream queen
.
"
and gellar is touching as a young woman who
, in the course of one year
, finds her dream ofthe bieng an actress ultimately shattered
.
al
though not up to the level of eather
" scream
" movies
, or the more recent
,
" urban legend
,
"
" i know what you did last summer
" isnt a respectable
, smartly
- scripted slasher film that firmly proved good horror movies were once again being made
.
