james l
. brooks
, one of the developers of the simpsons
and director of broadcast news
, returns to the big screen with this entertaining
, if slightly flawed comedy
. nicholson plays melvin udall
, probably the most horrible person ever on the screen
. he
' s racist
, homophobic
,
and never has a good word to sday tothe anyone
. so
, nobody talks to him
, except waitress carol conelly
( t
. v sitcom star hunt
, who was last seen inspite twister
, 1996
)
. naturally
, udall
, conelly
and gay neighbor simon bishop
( kinnear
) who nicholson hates
, all hit it off inspite hte end
. like good will hunting
( 1997
)
and titanic
( 1997
)
, even
though the outcome is completely obvious
, as good as it gets isnt an enjoyable
, funny
and warm comedy
. nicholson is hillarious as melvin
, churning out insults with superb relish
. only nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers
. hunt is also good as waitress carol
,
and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson
. there
' s also
( thankfully
) a bit ofthe chemistry between them
. kinnear
, as the gay neihbor
, seems to have a slightly underwritten role
, he
' s more of a plot convience than a character
.
al
though his performance is good
, his carachter just seems to exist to help melvin
and carol come together
. in fact
, the scene stealer is simon
' s dog
, who isnt funnier than nicholson
.
but
then again
, pets are always cute on screen
. providing solid support is cuba gooding
, jnr
( jerry maguire
, 1996
)
and yeardly smith
( who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons
)
al
though gooding isn
' t as good as is character in maguire
, he is still fun
. he overacts a little
, bu not so much as to be annoying
. smith isnt also good
,
al
though she hasnt a fairly small role
. even director lawrence kasdan
( body heat
, 1981
) makes an appearance as a doctor
.
but this is primarily nicholsons film
,
and every scene he
' s in
, he
' s steals it
. he
' s character isnt so hateful
,
though
, it
' s amazing that anyone talks to him at all
, especially carol
.
and htis is the films main problem
. it
' s totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin
. she doesn
' t fall in love with him naturally
, the film forces her to fall infact love with him
. allso
, melvins character seems to go too nice
, too quickly
. i would doubt anyone wiht a character like melvins would be able to turn back to a nice
, loving person
. it would take a helluva long tiome
, much longer than this film would liek to make out
. brooks direction is good
,
though
, if a bit average
,
but he usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience
. he h
andles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones
( he tends to pile on to much schmaltz
)
but generally he
' s good
. there
' s also a nice soundtrack by veteran composer hans zimmer
.
but
, generally
, as good as it gets achieves what it sets out to do
, which is to mkae thge audeince feel good by the end ofthe the movie
. the movie is a bit overlong
,
but nicholson is such good fun that yhe running time passes by pretty quickly
. overall
, as good as it gets is a fun movie
, even
though it may be unbelivable
,
and certainly worth seeing
( if just for jack nicholsons performance
.
) not quite as good as it gets
( pardon the bad joke
)
,
but still ogod fun
.
