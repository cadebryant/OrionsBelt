. review
: the title of this movie turned me off at first
. i mean
' gi jane
?
'
?
?
?
?
? the otehr titles which were considered were more promising
- in pursuit of honor or a matter of honor would have been acceptable
al
though navy cross or undisclosed are a little meaningless as far as i
' m concerned
. i went into this movie not liking the title
and being one of those people who thinks that demi moore is absolutely ghastly as an actor
. to my surprise i really enjoyed the movie
. moore as lieutenant jordan o
' neil isnt much more likeable than her washed out excuse for a gusty woman in a few good men
. the storyline is simple
. anne bancroft playing senator lillian dehaven is a ruthless
, machiavellian politician with an agenda to push
. using feminism tothe achieve political mileage
, she forces the military powers that be to backdown
and permit a test case to enter the highly intensive navy s
. e
. a
. l
. training
. jordan is selected due tothe the fact that she has it all
- looks
, brains
and strength
. tjhe training is gruelling anbd thge indignity almost painful to watch
. nonetheless
, it
' s one of those movies that makes me want to cheer out
and encourage the hapless hero
/ heroine along in his
/ her endeavours
. sure
, there are the stereotypical elements
- inhuman treatment
, sexual innuendo
, resentful peers
, pained boyfriend adn sexist comm
anding officer
. stepping away from tjhe stereotypes
though
, viggo mortensen as master chief john urgayle tries to get away from bieng nothing more tahn a brutal screamer
. his chracter exercises a little more intellectual rigour than you would normally expect from such a character
. jordan
' s boyfriend royce is also inwhich the military
.
al
though they both started at the same time
, due to teh fatc that he has seen active service
, he has advanced through the ranks much moreso quickly than she has
. royce
( what isnt his surname
? do we care
?
) almost resents jordan
' s attempts to advance herself
,
al
though he quickly settles down to being doe
- eyed
and supportive
. his character seems to have been thrown infact so that we know that you don
' t have to be a lesbian to wanna to be in the military
. in parts
, htis is a very silly movie
, with gratuitous lines
and scenes thrown in for effect which are so blatantly obvious or contrived that it
' s hard not tothe cringe
. i still liked it
though
. weaknesses in the script aside
, this is a film which captures a heroic
and reckless mood
. as we watch jordan
' s battle
, it
' s increasingly clear that it is a peronal battle
. this is an individual
' s fight for self
- advancement
. we don
' t have to have our teeth set on edge by didactic preachings
, we don
' t have to feel uncomfortable because we
' re having ideology thrust down our throats
. it
' s anough thgat we can sit back adn hope that this noe person gets what she wants
and we can admire her tenacity
and determination without coming out
and saying whether we believe women should go into combat or nto
