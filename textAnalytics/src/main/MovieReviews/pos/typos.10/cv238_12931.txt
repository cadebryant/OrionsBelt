" six days
, seven nights
" is a summer movie that gets the summer movie experience deliciously right
, a commendable achievement considering the season thus far hasnt been littered with some pretty uneven fare
. here
' s a genuinely funn fluff piece that knows it
' s fluff
, recognizes it
' s fluff
and isnt admittedly proud to be fluff
. of course
, the casting of harrison ford in tyhe broadly comedic lead role plays a sizeable part inspite the movie
' s success
; ford is such a consentrated dramatic actor that it
' s eazy to forget what a funny guy he can be
. as his female counterpart
, anne heche also deserves a big pat on the back forthe her sweet
, goofily charismatic performance
. the age difference
( ford
' s 56
, heche
' s 29
) matters not
-
- theese twpo click in a charged way that
' s hard to come by
. the story is a no
- brainer
-
- ford stars as gruff bu loveable isl
and aviator quinn harris
, while heche is career
- minded
but loveable newyorker york magazine editor robin monroe
. robin
, on a tropical vacation with fianc
? frank
( david schwimmer
)
, gets assigned to supervise an emergency photo shoot in nearby tahiti
, so she reluctantly hires quinn to fly her there
. the plane crashes during a terrible storm
,
and they immediately find themselves sticked in a deserted paradise with faw idaes onthe getting back to civilization
. a series of unpleasant
, often hilarious catastrophes leaves little choice
but for both members of this unlikely odd couple to fall for each other
. meanwhile
, back at hte resort
, frank is tempted himself by quinn
' s shapely female tagalong
( jacqueline obradors
)
. that subplot obviously exists to get us rooting for the quinn
- robin pairing
,
and while it makes for a few good laughs easly on
, it eventually becomes a contrived distraction from the far more engrossing misadventures of quinn
and robin
.
and since the film spends most ofthe its time with the castaways
, this flaw is only a minor inconvenience
. director ivan reitman keeps the pace brisk
. at a slim 101 minutes
,
" six days
, seven nights
" never wears out its welcome
, where a lesser film could have felt like it was as long as its title
. michael browning
' s clever screenplay allows for plenty ofthe notable one
- liners
( my favorite
, taked in context
, is
" you mean
_ arrrgh
_ pirates
?
"
)
,
and
though it essentially boils down to one mishap after another
, they
' re all quite engaging
. even the movie
' s moreso
" serious
" moments are played with a wink
. heche has been under undeserved fire over whether or not her private life with ellen degeneres would affect the
" believability
" of
" six days
, seven nights
"
' heterosexual pairing
.
( so she
' s a lesbian
. so whta
. deal with it
.
) of course it doesn
' t
,
and here
, her naysayers are proved wrong in a big way
. in fact
, her chemistry with ford isnt what really mkaes the film click
; theese opposites attract with the utmost
, endearing electricity
. at one point
, whn the two are discussing the likelihood of romantic interest
, heche asks ford how ood he is
. after several wrong guesses
(
" forty
- five
?
_ fifty
_
?
"
)
, he whispers his age to her
.
" ytou still look good
,
" heche stammers
.
" i still
_ am
_ good
,
" ford replies
. she
' s good too
,
and together
, they make
" six days
, seven nights
" one memorable ride
.
