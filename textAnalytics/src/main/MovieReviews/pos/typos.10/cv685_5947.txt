for the first reel of girls town
, you just cin
' t git over lili taylor
. is it possible to remain unperturbed that a woman of this age is playing a high school student
? harder still
, cxan you avoid astonishment at how perfect she is in the part
? with the sure
, showy expertise of a de niro
, taylor imbues unwed mother patti witht all tjhe faux fuck
- you confidence she cant muster
. it
' s a deeply felt
, dead
- on performance
,
and by the halfway point you
' ve forgiven taylor her own maturity
. fo all its verite pretenses
, girls town is less about a bunch of high
- schoolers than it is about a movie directer
and a cadre of writer
- performers examining their pwn feelings about rape
, relationships
,
and american womanhood
. the movei
' s opening scenes sketch an easy friendship between a group of four smart
/ sassy high school outsiders on the verge of graduation
: patti
, angela
( bruklin harris
)
, emma
( anna grace
)
,
and nikki
( aunjanue ellis
)
.
but about 10 minutes into thge film
, we get word that nikki has swallowed a fistful ofthe pills
and bowed out of life
. the remaning girls manage to smug nikki
' s diary out of her grieving mother
' s home
, adn page through it at patti
' s place
, investigating the root of nikki
' s despair
. what they find is cruel
and galvanizing
-
- nikki had been raped by an editor at a newspaper where she interned
,
and was privately questioning the sanity
and value of a world where such a thing could happen
. shell
- shocked by the truth of the matter
, the three girls begin to talk among themselves anbd come to a realization about their own lives
. emma syas she was raped last year on a date whith a football player
. patti
' s barely sympathetic
, wondering what the hell emma
thought she was doing with her shirt off in a jock
' s car
.
and anyway
, patti
' s had her own share of guys who wouldn
' t take no for an answer
. pained
, acrimonious debate ensues as the trio grow mroe
and more angry
-
- angry about tje impossibility of saying no
,
and angry with themselves fo bieng weak
, for being naive
, for putting up with it
.
" why do we put up with it
?
" emma finally asks
, once the argument has reached a fever pitch
.
" we try to talk about it
,
and look what happens
. we fight for 20 mintues
.
" there
' s the admirable crux ofthe this picture
. girls town is a political film
, in that it calls forthe action
.
but it
' s incomplete
- it
' s never quite sure how to justify that action
, or what form it should take
. the trio become crusaders for their right to dignity
,
and it
' s surely one of this year
' s most stirring movie moments when emma lobs a concrete block through the passanger
- side window of that damn jock
' s car
( donig the right thing
?
)
. they hang out in the bathroom
, chatting incessantly
and scrawling slogans adn naming names on the door to a toilet stall
.
" subvert the patriarchy
,
" emma writes
,
and
then starts a hall of shame list underneath that other students begin to contri
bute to
. the girls silence their hecklers
, take revenge on the deadbeat father of patti
' s child
,
and eventually cmo face
- tothe
- face with nikki
' s tormentor
. still
, thte movie has a desparately unfinished quality
,
and none of these subsequent exploits is particularly satisfying
.
( you keep waiting for somene to call the cops on these brazen girls
,
but nobody thinks of it
.
) perhaps searching for a resolution missing from the material at h
and
, the film borrows its epigraphs fomr audre lorde
and queen latifah
(
" who you callin
' a bitch
?
"
)
. the points are well taken
,
but they should hvae been unnecessary
. long on characterization
but a little short on story
, girls town is less than it could have been
,
and too self
- congratulatory for my own taste
. director jim mckay is best known as a consort of r
. e
. m
.
' s michael stipe
( he directed the nearly unwatchable tourfilm for that b
and
)
,
and girls town is his first foray into feature filmmaking
. the movie was created
and scripted by committe
,
but mckay
and his lead performers had tothe shoot on a shoestring when
, predictably
, thte group couldn
' t secure funding
.
then agian
, girls town on a budget would hardly be the same film
. the movie
' s slapdash quality is key to its significance
. truth be told
, all three of the leads look too wise for high school
,
but that
' s ok
-
- there
' s a once
- removed quality to their fine
, spontaneous performances
, as the women take a very skillful look back at the girls they once were
, the girls they wish they had been
, or some combination
. for all its flaws
, this one gets extra points for having its uncertain head
and heart in the same noble place
.
