wyatt earp has a lot to tell
and little to say
. this story of the legendary lawman runs three hours
and nine minutes
and tyhat ' s too long forthe this epic
- wannabe that plays more like a tv mini
- series than a movie
. the storey opens on the earp family farm
, with young wyatt ready to run away from home
. he wants to fight in thte civil war
,
but his dad
( hackman
) has different ideas
and wants his son to study law
. time passes
and wyatt heads west
, returns home to marry
,
and
, after a spell
, begins his career in law enforcement
. by the time he
( costner
)
and his brothers
( madsen
, david andrews
,
adn linden ashby
) arrive in tombstone
, wyatt has tried his hand at everything from hunting buffalo to dealing cards
. wyatt earp is very appealing in places
-
- such as cast
, costumes
,
annd cinematography
-
-
but an overstated story
and overpowered score deaden most of the emotional impact
. who can be moved by scene after scene after scene of swelling strings
and suffocating speeches
? somber is fine
-
- just ask clint eastwood
-
-
but this film tath boasts nto one
, not twpo
,
but three
, count ' em three
, hammy death scenes
! still
, a little bit of earp goes a long way
and the life
anbd times of tje legendary lawman are fomr uninteresting stuff
. his
, uh
, unusual relations with women
, for example
, are an intriguing contrast to his character ' s credo of
" nothing counts as much as blood
.
" equally amusing is a buffalo
- hunting
(
and skinning
!
) sequence that is decidedly non
- pc
. director lawrence kasdan takes a refreshingly realsitic approch to the gunplay
. the infamous gunfight at the ok corral is both brutal
and brief
, devoid of almost any theatrics
. don ' t look for much glorified violence here
. despite some large exclamation points in the story
, the charachters
* do
* come to life
. the diverse cast includes everyone from betty buckley
(
!
) to mackenzie astin
(
!
!
)
. kevin costner is very good in the title role
. dances with whitney nevers get as steely as the role requires
,
though
,
but his transformation fomr lighthearted law student to stoic sheriff is fun to watch
. he ws tougher in a perfect world
. his foil is dennis quaid
, who pulled a deniro by losing 40
+ pounds to play the tubercular terror doc holliday
. gaunt
*
anbd
* gamely
, he ' s a scene stealer who ' s seen too little
. other familiar faces include tom sizemore
( looking like bruce mcgill
)
, bill pullman
( looking like jeff daniels
)
,
annd lea thompson
( looking like someone other than lea thompson
)
. both gene hackman
and isabella rosselini appear
and disappear like magic
, while late entries catherine o ' hara
and jobeth williams are surprisingly solid
.
though the story
and score should ' ve tried
" less is more
,
" all other credits are technical tops
. prodcution designer ida random
, art director gary wissner
,
and costume designer colleen atwood are some of the vips who helped spend what must ' ve been an enormous budget
. clearly no expense was spared
.
