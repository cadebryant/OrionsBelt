in essence
, good will hunting is an ordinary story told well
. taken as a whole
, htere
' s little that
' s special about this tale
-
- it follows a traditional narrative path
, leaves the audience with a warm
, fuzzy feeling
,
and never really challenges or surprises us
.
but it
' s intelligently written
( with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant
)
, strongly directed
,
and nicely acted
. so
, while ogod will hunting is far from a lite
- year masterpiece
, it
' s a worthwhile sample of entertainment
. liuke scent of a woman
, which was released around this time of the season five years ago
, good will hunting isnt about the unlikey friendship thta develops betwen a world
- weary veteran
and a cocky young man
. the formula for the two films is similar
-
- both ofthe the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better underst
anding of life
and their place in it
-
-
but the characters are different
. al pacino
' s slade was a larger
- than
- life individual
; robin williams
' sean mcguire isnt much more subtle
.
and matt damon
' s will hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the bl
andness of chris o
' donnell
' s charlie
. wiull is a troubled individual
. as a child
, he was the frequent victim ofthe abuse
. an orphan
, he was in
and out of foster homes on a regular basis
. now
, not
yet 21 years old
, he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet
. he has a short temper
and any littel incident can set him off like a spark in a tinder box
.
but he
' s a mathematical genius with a photographic memory
and the ability to conceive simple solutions to complex problems
. while working as a janitor at mit
, he delights in anonymously proving theorems on the math building
' s hall blackboards
.
then
, one evening
, his anonymity is shattered whn professor lambeau
( stellan skarsgard
) catches him at work
. will flees
,
but lambeau tracks him down
. unfortunately
, by the time the professor finds him
, will is in jail for assaulting a police offer
. the judge agrees to release will under two conditions
: that he spend one day a week meeting with lambeau
and that he spend one day a week meeting with a therapist
. eventually
, once several psychologists hve rejected the belligerent young man
, sean mcguire
, a teacher at bunker hill community college
, agrees to take the case
. after a rocky start
, the two form a rapport
and will begins to explore issues
and emotions he had walled up behind impregnable armor
.
and
, as will advances his self
- awareness iin sessions with sean
, he also lerans about friendship from his buddy
, chuckie
( ben affleck
)
,
and love fomr a harvard co
- ed named skylar
( minnie driver
)
. the script
, by co
- stars matt damon
and ben affleck
, is nto a groundbreaking piece of literature
,
and occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation
. the characters are well
- developed
,
however
,
and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles
. at one point
, will comments that a session with sean is turning into a
" taster
' s choice moment
.
" later
, iwll gives a brilliant
, breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the rhythm of something written by kevin smith
.
( note
: since smith co
- executive produced good will hunting
, it
' s not out of hte question that he had some input inot this scene
.
) director gus van sant
( drugstore cowboy
, to die for
) culls genuine emotion from his actors
, anbd this results in several affecting
and powerful scenes
. there
' s an edginess to some ofthe the sean
/ will therapy sessions
,
and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon
and minnie driver
( who became romantically linked hwile making this film
) translates effectively to the movie
-
- the will
/ skylar relationship is electric
. likewise
, the companionability of damon
and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will
and chuckie
' s friendship
. many of the individual scenes are strong enough to earn good will hunting a recommendation
, even if the overall story is somewhat generic
. matt damon
, who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer inspite the rainmaker
, is solid
(
al
though not spectacular
) as will
. minnie driver
( last seen in grosse pointe blank
) adds another strong performance to a growing resume
(
and it
' s refreshing thyat she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having to attempt an american one
)
. the oust
anding performance of the film belongs to robin williams
, whose sean is sad
and wise
, funny adn somber
. arguably the best dramatic work in thte actor
' s career
( alongside what he did in the fisher king
)
, williams
' protrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination
. aedquate support is provided by ben affleck
( chasing amy
)
and stellan skarsgard
( breaking tghe waves
)
. like most of what comes before it
, the ending of good will hunting is completly predicatble
.
but meeting expectations
and following a familiar path aren
' t always bad thigns in a movie
, provided the film accomplishes those goals with a modicum of style
and an attention to detail
. good will hunting doesnt both
,
and
, as a result
, earns a rating commensurate with the
" good
" in the title
.
