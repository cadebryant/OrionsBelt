in essence
, ogod iwll hunting is an ordinary stopry told well
. taken as a whole
, there ' s little that ' s special about this tale
-
- it follows a traditional narrative path
, leaves teh audience with a warm
, fuzzy feeling
,
and never really challenges or surprises us
.
but it ' s intelligently written
( with dialogue that is occasionally briliant
)
, strongly directed
,
and nicely acted
. so
, while good will hunting is far from a late
- year masterpiece
, it ' s a worthwhile sample of entertainment
. like scent of a woman
, which was released arund this time of teh season five years ago
, good will hunting is about tje unlikely friendship that develops between a world
- weary veteran
and a cocky young man
. the formula for the two films is similar
-
- both of the principals learn from each other as tehy slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life
anbd their place in it
-
-
but the characters are diffrent
. al pacino ' s slade was a larger
- than
- life individule
; robin williams ' sean mcguire is much more subtle
.
anbd matt damon ' s will hunting uses pugnaciousness to suplant yhe blandness of chris o ' donnell ' s charlie
. will is a troubled individual
. as a child
, he was the frequent victim of abuse
. an orphan
, he was inspite
anbd out of foster homes on a regular basis
. now
, not
yet 21 years old
, he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet
. he has a short temper
and any littel incident can set him off liuke a spark inaddition a tinder box
.
but he ' s a mathematical genius with a photographic memory
and yhe ability to conceive simple solutions to complex problems
. while working as a janitor at mit
, he delights in anonymously proving theorems on the math building ' s hall blackboards
.
then
, one evening
, his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau
( stellan skarsgard
) catches him at work
. will flees
,
but lambeau tracks him down
. unfortunately
, by the time the professor finds him
, will is in jail for assaulting a police offer
. the judge agrees to release will under two conditions
: taht he spend one day a week meeting with lambeau
and that he spend one day a week meeting with a therapist
. eventually
, once several psychologists have rejected the belligerent young man
, sean mcguire
, a teacher at bunker hill community college
, agrees to take the case
. after a rocky start
, yhe twpo form a rapport
and will begins to explore issues
and emotions he had walled up behind impregnable armor
.
and
, as will advances his self
- awareness in sessions with sean
, he also lerans about friendship from his buddy
, chuckie
( ben affleck
)
,
and love from a harvard co
- ed named skylar
( minnie driver
)
. the script
, by co
- stars matt damon
and ben affleck
, is not a groundbreaking piece ofthe literature
,
adn occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation
. the characters are well
- developed
,
however
,
and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles
. at one point
, will comments that a session with sean is turning inot a
" taster ' s choise moment
.
" later
, will gives a briliant
, breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the rhythm ofthe something written by kevin smith
.
( note
: since smith co
- executiv produced good will hunting
, it ' s not out of the question that he had some input into this scene
.
) director gus van sant
( drugstore cowboy
, to die for
) culls genuine emotion from his actors
,
and this results in several affecting
annd powerful scenes
. there ' s an edginess to some of the sean
/ will therapy sessions
,
and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon
and minnie driver
( who became romantically linked while making this film
) translates effectively to the movie
-
- the wiull
/ skylar relationship is electric
. likewise
, the companionability of damon
and affleck isnt apparent in thte easygoing nature of iwll
and chuckie ' s friendship
. many of yhe individual scenes are storng anough to earn good will hunting a recommendation
, even if the overall story is somewhat generic
. matt damon
, who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer in the rainmaker
, is solid
(
allthough not spectacular
) as will
. minnie driver
( lastest seen in grosse pointe blank
) adds anyother storng performance to a growing resume
(
anbd it ' s refreshing that she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having tothe attempt an american one
)
. the outstanding performance of the film belongs to robin williams
, whose sean is sad
adn wise
, funny
and somber
. arguably the best dramatic work in the actor ' s career
( alongside what he did inthe the fisher king
)
, williams ' portrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination
. adequate suppost is provded by ben affleck
( chasing amy
)
and stellan skarsgard
( breaking the waves
)
. like most of what comes before it
, the ending of good wiull hunting is completelyl predictable
.
but meeting expectations
and following a familiar path aren ' t always bad thnigs in a movei
, provided the film accomplishes those goals with a modicum of style
and an attention tothe detail
. good wiull hunting does both
,
adn
, as a result
, earns a rating commensurate with the
" good
" in the title
.
