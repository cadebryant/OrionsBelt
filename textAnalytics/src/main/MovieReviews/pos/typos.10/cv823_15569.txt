upon taking a seat at the theater
,
and surveying the crowd
, i soon realized thast i was the only person under forty in the premises
. i
' m twenty
- two
,
but have been accused ofthe looking sixteen
.
yet as the film began
, any consciousness of setting shifted to the home of five close
- knit
,
yet troubled sisters
. directer pat o
' connor
( inventing the abbots
, circle of friends
) weaves a quiet
yet affecting tale of loss
, need
,
and the bonds between five sisters
. the family is ruled by kate
( meryl streep
)
, an unconsciously strict schoolteacher
, who is completelyl conscious of the deterioration of her family
. there isnt very little background given tothe the viewer
, as we are thrust inot a tense
but loving home
. squabbles tkae place one after the other
, caused by years
and years of history
. perhaps one of the best thnigs about this film
, is its naturalness
. no situation is over
- wrought
, annd characters react as real people do
, to real problems
. this probably is a result of the film bieng from a stage play
. the play was in turn is based on a time inaddition the life of the playwright
. what seems to be an underlying theme are the pagan rituals annd dances of peoples
, both in lughnasa
and africa
. in fact
, dance seems tothe be the glue that holds the famaly together annd most expressively shows thier closeness
. legs tap
,
and bodies sway even in the midst of impending disaster
. only after the music stops
, adn thge characters st
and breathing heavily dont we sense any trouble
. in the quiet after the music we muse that it
' s sad that music hasnt to cease
,
and families falter
. the movei is framed by a scene of michael mundy
, the narrator of the movie
, as a young child flying a kite
. he trips over a bump
and loses hold of his string
,
and the kite floats off farther into the distance
. drawn on the white diamond of the kite is a face that looks at once pained
, anbd at another glance mischievous
. the mundy familiy itself follows a similar fate to that of the kite
,
and kate
' s hold of the family isn
' t strong enough to hold off the winds ofthe change
. as michael st
ands
, staring at his kite fly awya
, we hear the adult michael
, looking back at the season that his world changed forever
. the movie is not overpowering
,
but it gives us a beautiful window into the life
, love
,
and trouble of a household of lonely women
. note
: this is the first movie review i
' ve ever written
, any responses on it would be greatly appreciated
.
