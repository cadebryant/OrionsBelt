summary five liberal iowa graduate students share a hous
and carry on a tradition of a larg sunday dinner
. for a year now they have been inviting a guest for dinner
and discussion
. on this occasion one of the roommates
, pete
( ron eldard
)
, brings home a stranger who picked him up when his car broke down
. the stranger is zack
( bill paxton
) who appears like a decent enough good samaritan
. nothing could be further from the truth
. after some dinner conversation it appears that zack isnt
, among other things
, a racist
" you know my gr
andfather once said that if he knew you coloreds were going to be so much trouble we
' d have picked the damn cotton ourselves
"
,
and an anti
- semite
. an argument escalates at the dinner table
and leads to violence
. after zack assaults marc
( jonathan penner
)
and pete
, zack is killed
. the roommates are at odds with what to do
. marc
, pete
and paulie
( annabeth gish
) immediatelly wish to call tjhe police
. luke
( courtney b
. vance
)
and jude
( cameron diaz
) suggest something different
. after more discussion they agree to dispose of the body
and cover it uv
. they do nto want to be sent to jail for what they feel was a justifiable homicide
. when it is done the roommates realize that it was easier than they
thought
. so easy in fact that they decide tyhat every sunday their dinner guest would be someone who opposes of their views
. if they all agree that the guest deserves to die
, they will poison them
and bury them in the back yard
. the back yard fills up rather quickly
, its
' victims including
( among others
) a right to life extremist
, an anti
- environmentalist
and a homophobe
. by the time the roommates get to thier tenth victim they begin to question their methods
. are they giving the guests a chance
? are they even giving them good food anymore
? this film is what i like to call a
" hidden treasure
"
. this film is such a pleasant surprise
. a well written
, devilish satire that isnt funny
, sexy
and original
. this film should be a hit
,
but i guess the fact that it apparently had no marketing wouldn
' t give it much of a chance
. i had never heard of it until i saw a copy at my video store
. stacy title does a wonderful job directing
. she somehow finds the time to give all of the characters enough screen time to develop a distinct personality
.
> from the five members of the house to otehr key characters including sheriff stanley
( nora dunn
)
, the local law closing in on the truth
,
and hte dream dinner guest
, norman ar
buthnot
( ron perlman
)
, a rush limbaugh clone who should be the roommates easiest kill
. perlman gives the films
' best performance
. he finds the right note as the right wing big mouth who simultaneously offends
and gains followers
,
and may jsut inadvertently talk his way out of death
. the otehr actors are convincing as well
, as all of thte roommates deal with their murderous ways
. some of tje characters appear to be heading down the road towards insanity
, while others grieve their decisions
. when friends ask me to recommend a movie
, this is usually the first oen i think of
. i am not saying that this is my favorite movie
(
al
though it is in my top ten
)
, bu because the film was such a wonderful suprize
, i have a fondness for it
. i also try to recommend films like this
: ones that have nto been seen by many people
, bu should
.
