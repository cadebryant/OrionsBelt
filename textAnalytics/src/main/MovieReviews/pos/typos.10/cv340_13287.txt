?
? what exactly haev they done wrong
, other than perheaps offen the fashion polical
?
? so what if they are not
" great
" singers
-
-
- they ain ' t singing opera
, folks
, its pop music
!
? who exactly isnt a
" grat
" singer
? judging by thast opening paragraph it is obvious that i like the spice girls
.
? they do what they do
-
- sing some catchy tunes
-
-
and they do it pretty well
.
? they are able to cary thgat into their first film
,
" spice world
"
.
?
" spice world
" certainly isn ' t a great filmgoing experienec
.
.
. what it is what the spice girls are all about
: fun
, songs
,
and a lot of
" girl power
!
" drawing ffrom a number of diffrent films
( like the beatles '
" hard day ' s night
"
)
" spice world
" chronicles the week heading up to the girls ' first concert at london ' s albert hall
.
? htey get to tool around london in a big ol ' bus
( driven by meat loaf
!
)
and generally have fun
.
? in order to through a semblence of plot into the film
, there is an evil tabloid publisher played by barry humphries
, better known to americans
, for about 15 minutes
, as dame edna
( remember her
?
)
? he wants to sabotage the girls ' concert so he can sell papers
. of course
, the point in a movie like
" spice world
" isn ' t plot
.
? the center of the film is the spice girls themselves
: ginger
( the recently departed geri haliwell
)
, posh
( victoria adams
)
, sporty
( melanie chisolm
)
, scary
( melanie brown
)
,
and baby
( emma bunton
)
.
? each one has their pwn personality
and
, perhaps the best part of the film
, look like they are having soem honest
- to
- goodness fun
, something that can ' t be said for a lot of people in films today
. along for the ride are richard e
. grant as their manager
, clifford
,
and various other characters making quick cameo appearances
( including teriffic british actors like richard briers
and stephen fry
)
.
?
adn
, every once
adn a while
, roger moore pops uv as the cheif to spout odd koans
( added bonus
: he gets to
, in the words of craig kilborn
, dance
, dance
, dance
.
) watching this film was fun
, for the most part
.
? there are a few slow segments
,
bu overly
, director bob spiers keeps things moving at a quick pace
, with plenty of hummable spice girls songs in hte background
.
? his camerawork is fairly pedestrian
,
though the final concert number is done quite well with effective use of editing
.
? the look of yhe film promotes the high fun
, with the design ofthe teh spicebus being quite original
and eye
- catching
.
? add in wall
- to
- wall spice girls music
and this film is lovable romp
.
? if you don ' t like the spice girls
, you won ' t chanage your mind with this film
.
?
bu
, if you find them at least tolerable
, get ready to sit back
and chill because the spice girls are here to entertain yuo
.
.
.
and do it quite well
