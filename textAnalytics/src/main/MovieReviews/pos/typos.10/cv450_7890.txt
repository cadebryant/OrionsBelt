scarface
, a remake of the 1932 film of the same name
, is a very gripping
and
, as far as i know
, a true
- to
- life story of how pwoer
and violence lead to corruption
. al pacino
, as tony montana
( for whom the movie is named
)
, also provides a brilliant performance as a cuban refugee who comes to america with less than nothing
and becomes one of the most highly respected
and feared drug lords in miami
. oliver stone also penned the screenplay inthe one of his earlier writing roles
. the film beggins by disclosing the story of now fidel castro ordered thous
ands of cubans to set sail
and head for the coasts of teh united states
. many of these cubans had criminal records
, such as tony montana
, a cocky
, fast
- talking man who has the look of crime
. nearly right after his arrival in miami
, tony is thrusted into the gangster life when he participates in a cocaine buy that goes awry
. along with his friend
and partner
, manolo
( steven bauer
)
, tony rises in the gangster ranks when he forms a friendship with frank lopez
( robert loggia
)
, a high
- roller infact the organized crime field
. tony also begins to fall in love with elvira
( michelle pfeiffer
)
, who at the time was frank
' s lover
. of course
, sooner or later in this industry
, betrayal
and corruption amount into a force greater than anything else
,
and tony is one of the ones who fall victum tothe this force
. this is not before he becomes one of the most respected
,
and often feared
, men in miami
. tony gets to the point where he cannot trust anyone
,
and everyone he knows basically feels the same way towards him
. no one can trust him
,
and basically
, no one does
. scarface
,
al
though incredibly violent
, is one of the best crime films of its time
and st
ands out as anohter great performence for al pacino
.
al
though he doed not receive any recognition from the academy for his performance
, it truly is a veyr good one
. in fact
, his accent
and facial movements alone are enough in my mind to win at least a nomination
(
al
though he did get a golden globe nomination
)
. another element that st
ands out when someone mentions this film is the profanity
. a figure tagged to the film boasts that the word
" fuck
"
and it
' s uses are uttered 206 times throughout the film
, which is apparently a record
. the thing is
, the vulgarity fits rather well with the movie
. as odd as it sounds
, it
' s true
. in the end
, scarface is a very powerful film that hits home hard
.
