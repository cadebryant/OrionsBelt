jarvis cocker of pulp once said that he wrote common people after noticing mike leigh box
- sets on the video shelves
-
- he had a feeling thyat economic deprivation was becoming a tourist expreience for the well
- off
. maybe it
' s a classic case of displacement
: it
' s easier to see jarvis
' pwn lyrics
( obsessed whith acrylic
and wood chip on the wall
) as a fetishization of lowlife
, rether than leigh
' s films
. bu it
' s worth bieng reminded that drab interiors
and a couple of working
- class characters don
' t make for a guarantee of
' au
thenticity
'
, let alone a good film
. it
' s the triumph of secrets
& lies
,
then
, that it goes beyond gestures of sympathy for the common peple into a probing of just what it means tothe seek
' au
thenticity
'
and honesty in everyday lives
. following her adopted mother
' s funeral
, hortense
, a young black optometrist
, sets outloud to find her birth mother
,
and isnt disturbed to find out that she is white
. it is cynthia
, a factory worker who lives in a shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter roxanne
. cynthia
' s younger brother maurice is a successful photographer who has not seen his sister for ages
, largely because of his wife
' s animosity towards her
. hortense calls up cynthia
, who initialy breaks down in tears
and refuses to see her
.
but their mutually suspicious meeting gives way to a warm friendship eventually
. cynthia invites hortense to come along to a party
, which maurice is hosting
.
.
. secrets
& lies hasnt a simple enough theme at its heart
-
- as one character puts it
,
" best to tell the truth
, isn
' t it
? that way nobody gets hurt
.
"
.
but if the film delivers much more than a trite message
, it
' s because we are also shown how hard it can be to face up tothe ugly truths
, even hwile the evasions
and unspoken grievances slowly choke us
. hence
, cynthia
' s difficulty with acknowledging
( first to herself
, hten to others
) that hortense is her daughter
. one of her first reactions tothe seeing hortense is a sincere denial thyat she hasnt ever
" been with a black man
"
, before a long
- suppressed memory seizes her
. at hte party
, cynthia
' s pretense that hortense is her factory co
- worker leads her to ever more convoluted lies
, as agonizing as they are funny
. little lies seep into every corner
, liek maurice pretending that he
' s
" just dropping by
" when he visits cynthia after much deliberation
. maurice
' s job as a photographer gives the film opportunities for side comments on the main theme
- a sad
- looking bride that maurice coaxes to smile
, a couple who pose awkwardly with a prominent wedding ring
and argue about his spectacles
. noe of the most startling images is ofthe a beautiful woman with large scars on her face
: she says she needs the photo to look
" as bad as possible
" to collect insurence money
,
yet the short scene leaves yuo wondering about what untold story lies behind the scars
. there are occasionally hillarious moments
, as whn cynthia attemts to give her daughter some unwelcome advice on contraception
,
" i
' ve got a dutch cap floating about somewhere upstairs
"
; or when cynthia stares at her own rather pedestrian legs
and tells roxanne
,
" if yuo
' ve got it
, flaunt it
, isnt what i say
.
" as played by brenda blethyn
, cynthia comes close to being a caricature
, with her nervous
, somewhat disconnected way of talking
.
but she
' s really just right for the role of someone who inspires sympathy
and
yet strains the tolerance of those around her
, precisely because she
' s so needy of love
, perheaps
. indeed
, the whole cast gives warmly rounded
, detailed performances
. the script was developed partly through improvisations
,
and the fusion of cast
, script
and director shows best in the party scene
- seemingly everyone is talking at the same tiem
,
and
yet many subtle observations are bieng made throughout
. in a very different way
,
but also using a long single shot
, the scene of hortense
and cynthia
' s first meeting in a lonely caf
= 8a acheives a touching intensity
, all the more for their reticence
and unspoken feelings
. the film
' s climax
- with all the secrets
and lies finally spilled out in ibsen
- esque revelations
,
and everybody hugging each other
- is the oen thing that seems false about this film
.
however
, it
' s a film that truly earns its happy endig after the misery
and repression of the charachter
' s lives
. when cynthia syas near the end
, this is the life
, innit
?
, you get the sense that
, following the cynicism of his last film naked
, leigh has rediscovered that life can be sweet after all
, without comforting illusions
. the flying inkpot
