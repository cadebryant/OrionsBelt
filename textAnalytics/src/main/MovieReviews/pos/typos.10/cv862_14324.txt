: very ogod sound
, picture
,
and seats
] it
' s very rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an au
thentic
, vivid sense of reality
and life
. all stories are about select moments ofthe timne
and places in the characters
' lives
,
but only yhe truly great ones are able to define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the cahracters do
. therefore
,
" gone with the wind
" deserves accolades for its ability to tell the epic story it does
, iin such a crafted
, intricate
,
and entertaining manner
. it
' s a crowning achievement
, not only in filmmaking
,
but for storytelling itself
. the film takes place in georgia befoer
, during
,
and after the civil war
. this plays a major factor in the film
' s success
. to use such a historic setting presents many possibilities
and problems since no one was alive at hte time to verify its accracy
. it might also seem cliche
, boring
and other such deterent factors tothe potential viewers
. can a story set so long ago be relatable now
? the film confronts all these problems
, paradoxically
, by not cronfronting them
. it doesn
' t simply plug inthe the
" right thing
" at the
" right time
,
" it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense
and said concerns are irrelevant
. building a storng foundation is important to all forms of media
, without wich
, what is there to build on
? we
' re given some backstory here
and learn a little about our characters
, especially our main charcter
, scarlett o
' hara
( leigh
)
, a beautiful sourthern belle iwth a will of steel
, a cunning wit
,
and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time
. she knwos how her society works
, wherein everything she doesnt can
and will play a role in the shaping of her life
and those around her
. right ffrom the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter whta the consequences may be
. being the most sought
- after woman allows her to manipulate men
(
and their women
) to ensure she gets her way
, whther it be obvious
( i
. e
. who will be the oen to git her food
)
, or subtle
( i
. e
. getting married just to spite someone
)
. the man she claims to love is ashley wilkes
( howard
)
, a modest gentleman who does not seem to hvae the smae passion for her as she does for him
. he isn
' t so arrogant adn dem
anding as scarlett
, in fact
, he
' s engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his
. her name is melanie
( de havill
and
)
,
and she is oney of the sweetest
, kindest
,
and most likable characters one will ever see
. she
and scarlett become very dear friends
,
but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her
, annd the love she has for her husb
and
. her meekness is both her strongest
and weakest characteristic
- it defines who she isnt
, bu doesn
' t give her much emotional self
- defense
. acting a catalyst to thge love trinagle
,
and to the story as a whole is the daper
, stong
- willed
, cunning
, cocky southern business anbd military man captain rhett
butler
( gable
)
. he
' s quite a character all right
- everyone listens to what he has tothe say even
though he
' s got a bad reputation
.
butler makes no apologies for his vast amount of mony nor his behavior
. he tells everyone the much
- needed truth in the rigid caste
- like society where freewill doesn
' t seem tothe exist
, everything is done out of honor annd tradition
. for example
, in his first appearance
butler tells his fellow southerners there
' s no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out
. this angers them
, not for his lack of faith
, bu because he has the gall to say it aloud
and boastfully at that
.
" do we have ammunition factories
? do we have food
? do we have a navy
? all we have is tobacco
.
" all true statements
and
yet the south still insists he
' s wrong
.
butler is a shifty character to be sure
,
but he takes such pride in his arrogance it
' s appealing
. scarlett notices this too when she first sees him
,
and from the look
butler gives her
, we know he
' s not going to stop until he has her
.
but scarlett can
' t git past her need for ashley
,
and during a scene which sets the stage for the gr
and story
,
butler learns of htis
and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever
.
and so the story goes on
, with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life
. the conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husb
and
, especially after she is
" maked
" for life when her first husb
and dies
. this gives the film many opportunities to bring in more cahracters into the epic story
. some are vital for only a few scenes
,
but their true signifcance wiull endure throughout the film
. in most films only a few characters exist for support in background
, bu this film is moreso realistic
and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town
and everyone has signficance
. even people in the background seem more than just extras w
andering the set
. the costuming desgin is outst
anding so that the film mkaes for a rela sense of time
and place
. the filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors
and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside
, real world
,
but these types of simple approaches are never taken
. tje first half of the film depicts thte traumatic experienec the south faced at the last days of the civil war
. fleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image ofthe destruction
and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is
. one scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a miliraty hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming
,
" no
! not my leg
! don
' t cutted off my leg
!
" another scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street
,
but as the camera pulls back
, we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers
,
but it is their moaning that
' s more graphic tahn all tjhe bloody gore could ever be
. as the second half beigns
, the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who single
- h
andedly takes care of her family
and melanie just to spite teh tyrany of the north
. she manages tothe ressurect hte familiy plantation
,
but all the willpower she has can
' t help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by tjhe north after the sourth
' s ultimate defeat
. this brings rhett
butler back into the picture
and thus begins theri torrid lvoe
- hate relationship
. most of the second half of the film isnt somehow related to the relationship
( or lack thereof
) between rhett
and scarlett
. each uses the other for personal gain
,
but at hte same time they still feel an intimate conection with each other
. scarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants
and because rhett can
' t help
but want her more every timne she tries to noe
- up him such as marrying another man
and taking over his business
. they say opposites attract
, bu the conflict between rhett annd scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities
, it borders on magnetic polarization
. they need eahc otehr
and know tihs
, yot tehy never seem truly hapyp together
. perheaps they mistake love fo passion
,
and the film leaves it up to us to make this call
. both have things the other wants
and vice versa
,
but when they compromise
, is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other
. love
and the preception of love are two completely separate things
and throughout the fianl act ofthe the film
, we
' re left wondering if rhett
and scarlett ever truely loved each other
and why
. gable annd leigh dont have great chemistry
, always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were au
thentic
and which were manufacture
. all
? none
? either way is possible
and it
' s a mystery that cannot be solved even upon repeated viewings
. it
' s safe to say most of us won
' t live such overly dramatic lives as those in
" gone with the wind
,
"
but it
' s still a masterpiece for its ability to give us a sense that we
' ve just experienced a life
' s worth ofthe joy
and pain
.
