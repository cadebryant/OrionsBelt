director dominic sena
( who made the highly underated kalifornia
)
and producer jerry bruckheimer
( the rock
, armageddon
) bring us a slick
and entertaining remake of the 1974 film ofthe the same name that absolutely no one has ever seen
. nicolas cage plays memphis
, a retired car theif who
' s
" pulled back in
" to the business by an evil car thief overlord
( christopher eccleston
) determined to kill memphis
' kid brother
( giovanni ribisi
)
. memphis is ordered tothe steal 50 cars inaddition four days time or his brother will meet an unfortunate demise
, all while having to elude the detectives hot on his trail
and a rival car thief who feels the job should hve been given to him
and his gang
. memphis sets out to put his old crew back together
,
but discovers that most of them have retired as well
. gone in sixty seconds does things right from the opening credits
. in thta sequence
, we get a rockin
' little tune from moby
, along with some simple back story told only with photographs
and assorted objects
. filmmakers can sometimes make or break a film just from its opening title sequence
,
and this one easily gets ytou in the mindset for an entertaining ride
.
and what follows doesn
' t disappoint
.
.
. cage turns in one of his good performances here
( he can easily go either way
.
.
. good or bad
.
.
. i don
' t nkwo how he does that
)
,
and his mannerisms
and dialogue delivery carry tghe film along nicely
. of the supporting casted members
, angelina jolie as memphis
' former love is in the film just to provide eye c
andy
( she
' s definitely the hottest looking grease monkey i
' ve ever seen
)
and robert duvall as memphis
' former mentor is just around to lend the film smoe class
. also
, i
' m a big fan of will patton
( armageddon
, the postman
)
and would love to see him get a huge role someday
. none of these three performers are given much to do unfortunately
. some underrated performers
however are given meaty supporting roles
. delroy lindo
( get shorty
) shines as the exasperated detective in pursuit of memphis
, as doens timothy olyphant
( go
) as lindo
' s partner
. i just wish smoe of the other characters could have been as important
. the only real gripe i have about tyhe film
though is its conclusion
.
.
. mainly because you know how it will end before the opening credits even roll
. there
' s no doubt inwhich anyone
' s mind tht the 50 cars iwll be successfully stolen
,
and the filmmakers blew a perfectly good opportunity to add some suspense tothe the picture by using the
" rival car thief
" plot line
. as it st
ands
, that story line is wrapped up about halfway through the film in a tidy little package
.
but if i was mkaing this film
, i
' d have had the rival gang trying to get to the cars before memphis
and his crew
, thereby making memphis have to improvise
.
.
. thereby adding some meat to the plot
. the finale is essentially just a big car chase
,
and there just aren
' t ways to make car chases interesting anymore
. it
' s all been done
. the chase is also shot
and edited in that
" jerry bruckheimer action sequence
" kind of way that leaves the audience wondering what specifically is going on in the scene
. sure it
' s a car chase
,
but what exactly are tyhe particulars of it
? it
' s vyer hard to tell
. finally
, there
' s a stunt during this scene that comes close to challenging the
" bus jumping the ramp
" sequence from speed in the
" oh
, i don
' t think so
.
.
.
" department
. dispite those minor complaints
, gone in sixty seconds is pure summer movie entertainment
. it
' s not
thought provoking
,
but it
' s shiny
, loud
and funn
.
.
. just what a summer flick should be
.
