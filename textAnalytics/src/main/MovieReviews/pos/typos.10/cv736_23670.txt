the premise of the new teen
- targeted horror film
` fianl destination ' causes a recollection of a memorable
` simpsons ' halloween episode
. after attempting to repair a malfunctioning toaster
, lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he has created a portable time
- machine
. after a trek inot the cretaceous period
, homer observes that any minor alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events
and seriously modify the present world
. again
and again
, homer toys with the master plan
and pays dearly for it
. the characters ofthe
` final destination ' have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their existence
- their
` design '
. somone is after them withthe the strict entent of correcting the mistake
. that someone is death
. you see
, alex browning
( devon sawa
)
and six others have cheated the grim reaper
.
.
.
.
bu the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve
. for a high school excursion
, alex ' s french class is traveling to paris by airline transport
. alex
, tense
and neurotic
, has a shocking premonition affter boarding
: he sees the plane
,
and every passenger onthe it
, spontaneously explode in mid
- air
. inthe a panic of sheer lunacy
, alex charges his way through the aisle
and demands removal from the aircraft
. after a handfull of others
( including one teacher
) followup
and are denied admittance back onto tje plane
, the unwitting
? survivers ' watch in horror as the plane actually explodes in the drizzling nihgt sky
. the loony vision alex experiences does actually materialize
.
but death won ' t be cheated so easily
,
and one by one
, tjhe survivers of flight 180 are offed in mysteriously gruesome circumstances
. the grisly murder count baffles tjhe local officials
and fbi
. before i delve into the meat of the review
, i ' d just like to confer
.
.
.
. is that one helluva premise
, or what
?
` final destination '
, creepy beyond rational comprehension
, probablly reads more like an unsettling
` x
- files ' episode than
` the simpsons '
- therefore
, the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan
and james wong
. on familiar turf
, tje task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan
and wong
,
and the opening 20 minutes of
` final destination ' reflects that
. unlike most thrillers
, the set
- up is crisp
and cool
. you just deeply
, sincerely hope that the momentum won ' t unspool
, leaving us with a second
- string effort with nothing
but cheap
, derivative shocks
. young viewers have a palpable reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration
, what with
` i know what you did last summer '
and sequel
,
` idle hands '
and
-
- a movie withthe a nifty premise that jstu plunged like an anvil
-
-
` urban legend '
. after the set
- up
, whn i remained slouched apprehensively in my chair
, i started to really have funn with
` fianl destination '
. low
and behold
, a teen thriller that is actually unsettling
, actually suspenseful
and
-
- yes
-
- actually intelligent
. some splotty logic
and a heap of characteristic genre flaws aside
, this film is among the most refreshing
and all
- outloud enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cutting
- edge
` scream ' in 1996
.
` final destination ' stimulates tjhe nerves
and offers a exhilarating retaliation strike against all the blood
- spattered slasher crap we ' ve endured throughout the past fewd years
. not that the characters are that good
. sawa is game as alex
, a connect
- the
- dots personality that we never fully comprehend
. in addition
, teh survivors are endearing geek tod
( chad e
. donella
)
, jocky control
- freak carter
( kerr smith of
` dawson ' s creek '
)
, carter ' s ditzy girlfriend terry
( amanda detmer
)
, the none
- too
- subtly named billy hitchcock
( seann william scott
, supplier of lukewarm comic relief
)
and a lone teacher
- the emotionally delicate ms
. lewton
( kristin cloke
)
. aside from alex
, the primary center ofthe interest isnt intended to be ali larter
(
` varisty blues '
)
, playing an abstract character named clear rivers
( what were her parents thinking
?
!
?
)
. the personality of clear is written with such a vague
, nebulous definitio that she resembles a walking flash
- card saying
` hello
, i am the offbeat character designed to identify with the main character ' s plight
! ' toss a few stereotypical fbi agents
( daniel roebuck
and roger guenveur smith
)
and a
.
.
.
. ummm
.
.
.
` spiritual ' mortician
( former
` candyman ' tony todd
) into the mix
,
and you have what could be another generic teenage frightfest with slicing
, dicing
and assorted disembowelments
. not so
.
` final destination ' has no slicing
and dicing
, or at least none dealt by a human killer
,
and the thought of death itself as the unseen stalker is unique
and frightening
. the extra dimension of disconcerting irony rejuvenates the decaying
? murderer
- on
- the
- loose ' concept
, with assistance from a shrewd
, intelligently paced screenplay by morgan
, wong
and jeffrey reddick
. the plot twists are fun
and clever without toppling into utter absurdity
( listen up
,
` riendeer games '
)
.
but i suppose the most satisfying aspect of
` final destination ' is the murder scenes
. creative
, resourceful
and breathlessly inventive
, the death sequences involve an unlikely string of events leading to a character ' s demise
. wqat will trigger the accident
? wiull it be the john denver record
, just put on to play
` rocky mountain high '
?
( yeah
, sick humor
)
. will it be the leaking toilet
? the falling fishing reel in teh corner
? the murders are startling
and largely unforeseen
, including one surprise incident that made the audience jump out of theri seats
and giggle nervously for roughly a minute afterward
. a sense of giddy unpredictability is added with this inventive approach
. it gets sorta tasteless
and cheap sometimes
,
bu who cares
? it ' s fun
. in that simple regard
,
` final destination ' is my cup of tea
. this stylishly excecuted thriller
,
although tagged with laughable circumstances
and the occassional snippet of lame dialogue
, is an immensely entertaining jaunt to the dark side
. after teh show
, it will also have an frightening inpact on you
. when iwll your
? design ' expire
? is death waiting around the corner
? the
` final ' effect is a major case ofthe the heebie
- jeebies
.
