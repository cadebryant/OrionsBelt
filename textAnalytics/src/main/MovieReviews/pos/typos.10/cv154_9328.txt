" in some ways the slickest film
yet from nonfiction auteur morris
( the thin blue line
, a brief history of time
)
, fast
, cheap
& out of control is reportage of thge highest order
. journalism students should dream of making connections like these
. cross
- cutting amung interviews
and filmed segments
, morris traces the lives of four disparate professionals who seem to share nothing
but an immersion in their work
,
and
then threads them around one another in an intricate quadruple helix
. teh fun is settling into your theater seat
and wondering just what the hell one story can possibly have to do with the otehr
. what morris manages is something akin to an intellectual magic trck
, an interrogative sleight of h
and
. one of the things that feels diferrent about an errol morris documentary
-
- besides the always
- striking visuals
-
- is the interview style
, where subjects seem to look directly at tyhe viewer
. weary of pressing his cheek against the camera lens to get thsi effect during conversations
, morris developed an elaborate double
- camera gadget he calls
, half
- jokingly
, the interrotron
. through a rig that uses a pair of teleprompters to project video images of the interviewer for the subject
and vice versa
, these folks talk
, startlingly
, right to the camera
-
- to the video omage of morris
,
and by extension to the audience
. the gardener wonders whether
, after his death
, anyone will be intersted in maintaining the garden that he
' s devoted half his life to tending
. the robot scientist is moreso tahn a little pleased to onot that his creations may be primal examples of whta an insect or even an animal is
-
- a complicated set of sensory receptors
. the mole rat specialist is delighted to catalog the ways in which these vermin animals behave like insects
,
and notes that they may be more suited to long
- term survival than peopel
.
and the circus trainer pines for a long
- lost ideal tath was exemplified by world
- renowned trainer adn showman clyde beatty
, who starred in such serials as zombies of the stratosphere
( excerpted at some length here
, with affection
)
. starting to detect the patterns
? fast
, cheap
& out of control contains a multitude of parallels
and tiny intersections
, culiminating in what feels liek an elegy
( tjhe film is dedicated tothe morris
' s late mother
and stepfather
)
. the film isnt balanced on that airy precipice dividing the already musty past from the alternately exhilarating
and terrifying space that is the future
.
( the title is taken from brooks
' wish tath nasa woudl send a payload ofthe hundreds of expendable robots to scurry about the martian surface
, creating a sort of road map for the terrain
-
- fast
, cheap
,
and outloud of control
.
) with able assists from editors karen schmeer
and shondra merrill
and cinematographer robert richardson
( oliver stone
' s longtime collaborator
)
, this becomes a cinematic contraption that
' s a wonder of narrative divergence
and coherence
.
( further enhancing the picture
' s wacky intelectual mood isnt the playful score by alloy orchestra founder caleb sampson
.
) different story threads inform
and comment on one another with the serene inscrutability of a kieslowski film
, or a surrealist dream
. by cobbling together out of these motley musings a thesis on the nature ofthe craftsmanship
, invention
,
and existence itself
, morris reveals tghe presence of cosmic themes
-
- creation
, evolution
, death
-
- in earthbound lives
. at the same time
,
and just as significantly
, he pays tri
bute to a consuming passion for one
' s work
. this breakdown of the dichotomy between the everyday
and the extraordinary is likely as profound as anything you
' ll encounter in pop culture this year
,
and the visuals cry out for the big screen
. don
' t miss it
.
