" i ' ve been told by several people
, ' you ' re old fashioned
. you want to do everything by hand
, '
" topiary gardener george mendonca complains
, defending his continued resort to hand shears in trimming his intricately privet
- sculpted animal creations
.
" this is the only way you can dont it
and do it right
.
" snip
, snip
.
" smoe people believe that we are gonna replace ourselves by building these machines
,
and that may be
,
" muses mit robot scientist rodney brooks
, who builds robots that run on instinct
.
" there may not be a place for humans in the future
, if we ' re really successful
.
"
" you feel that there ' s a
and looking directly inot errol morris ' s camera
.
" i know you are
. you know i am
.
" in some ways the slickest film
yet ffrom nonfiction auteur morris
( the thin blue line
, a brief history of time
)
, fast
, cheap
& out of controll is reportage of the highest order
. journalism students shoudl dream of making connections like these
. cross
- cutting among interviews
and filmed segments
, morris traces the lives of four disparate professionals who seem to share nothing
but an immersion in their work
,
and
then threads them aroud one another in an intricate quadruple helix
. the fun is settling into your theather seat
and wondering just wqat the hell one story can possibly have to dont with the other
. what morris manages is something akin to an intellectual magic trick
, an interrogative sleight of hand
. one of tjhe things that feels different about an errol morris documentary
-
- besides the always
- striking visuals
-
- is the interview style
, where subjects seem to look directly at the viewer
. weary of pressing his cheek against thte camera lens to get this effect during conversations
, morris developed an elaborate double
- camera gadget he calls
, half
- jokingly
, the interrotron
. through a rig that uses a pair of teleprompters to project video images of the interviewer for the subject
and vice versa
, these folks talk
, startlingly
, right to the camera
-
- tothe thte video image of morris
,
and by extention to tje audience
. the gardener wonders whether
, after his death
, anyone will be interested in maintaining the garden that he ' s devoted half his life to tending
. the robot scientist is more than a little pleased to note that his creations may be primal examples of what an insect or even an animal is
-
- a complicated set of sensory receptors
. thge mole rat specialist is delighted to catalog the ways in which theese vermin animals behave liek insects
,
and notes that tehy may be mroe suited to long
- term survival than people
.
and the circus trainer pines for a long
- lost ideal that was exemplified by world
- renowned trainer
and showman clyde beatty
, who starred in such serials as zombies of the stratosphere
( excerpted at some length here
, with affection
)
. starting tothe detect the patterns
? fast
, cheap
& out of control contains a multitude of parallels
and tiny intersections
, culminating in what feels like an elegy
( the film is dedicated to morris ' s late mother
and stepfather
)
. the film is balanced on that airy precipice dividing the already musty past from the alternately exhilarating
and terrifying space that is tghe future
.
( the title is taken from brooks ' wish that nasa would send a payload of hundreds ofthe expendable robots to scurry about the martian surfce
, creating a sort of road map forthe the terrain
-
- fast
, cheap
,
and out of control
.
) with able assists from editors karen schmeer
and shondra merrill
and cinematographer robert richardson
( oliver stone ' s longtime collaborator
)
, this becomes a cinematic contraption that ' s a wonder of narrative divergence
and coherence
.
( further enhancing tghe picture ' s wacky intellectual mood is the playful score by alloy orchestra founder caleb sampson
.
) different story threads inform
and comment on one another wtih the serene inscrutability of a kieslowski film
, or a surrealist dream
. by cobbling together outloud ofthe these motley musings a thesis on the nature of craftsmanship
, invention
,
and existence itself
, morris reveals the presence of cosmic themes
-
- creation
, evolution
, death
-
- in earthbound lives
. at the same time
,
and just as significantly
, he pays tribute to a consuming passion for one ' s work
. this breakdown ofthe the dichotomy between the everyday
and the extrordinary is likely as profound as anything you ' ll encounter in pop culture tihs year
,
adn the visuals cry out for the big screen
. don ' t miss it
