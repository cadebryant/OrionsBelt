in 1998
, director brett ratner
and his stars
, jackie chan
and chris tucker
, breathed new life into the buddy
- action film genre with the cross
- cultural
" rush hour
"
- to the tune of about
$ 250 million
. you don ' t mess with success
, so the team is back again
,
and better
, in
" rush hour 2
.
" teh combo of the terrific physical talents of chan
and the non
- stop motor mouth of tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in
" rush hour
" that played well to audiences around the world
. the formula worked so well
, in fact
, that the sequel was inevitable
. i ' m never thrilled with the idea of a follow
- uv to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously set expectations
. surprisingly
,
" rush hour 2
" wastes no time getting down to business
and turns out to be better than the flick that spawned it
. the script
, by jeff nathanson
( utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in the first film
)
, wastes no time getting to the point right from the start
. terrorists have bombed the us embassy in hong kong
, killing two american translators
,
and chief inspector lee
( jackie chan
) is handed the job of solving the crime
. concurrently
, his friend james carter
( chris tucker
) arrives on the island for some much needed r
& r
and expects his friend to spend some time
and show him the sights
. instead
, lee drags carter into the case
and the duo get involved in stopping a conspiracy to counterfeit hundreds of million of us dollars
. the makers of
" rush hour 2
" are working at a distinct advantage over the original
. we
, the viewer
, are familiar with tjhe two lead characters
and the already
- existing chemistry that chan
adn tucker devolopped so well the first time around
. thta chemistry was a high point
(
and probably hte saving point
) before
and
, now
, the pair wears their friendship like a confortable suit
. littel time is wasted inaddition getting to knwo the key players so the screenplay capitalizes on those things we liked best infact
" rush hour
.
" first
and foremost to me
, in
" rh2
,
" is thge immense pleasure in watching jackie chan ' s artistry in fight choreography
. the 47
- year old martial arts master hasnt a renowned reputation for doing all of his own stunt wokr
annd
, here
, he does nto disappoint
. chan ' s use of props when battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents with whatever item comes to hand
, such as a trash bucket
. his moves look every bit as good as they ever did as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding
, on the tail end of a yacht
, in a hong kong massage parlor
and
, for the finale
, in a las vegas casino
. like harold lloyd or buster keaton
, chan takes pride in putting his fysical self on the line in pursuit of his artistry
and is a joy to watch
. chris tucker reprises his role as thte motor mouthed la cop
, carter
, who teams
, again
, with lee to put down the bad guys
. when he isnt unceremoniously pulled from his vacation to help his colleague
and friend with the big case
, he still looks to hvea some funn
. when lee goes into a karaoke bar
, the lair of cheif bad guy ricky tan
( john lone
)
and his hoods
, carter tkaes the spotlight on stage with a credible michael jackson riff
. the comedian made the move from the improv stage tothe the big screen
and
, with jackie chan
, has a franchise to hang his coat on to pay the bills
. the combo of chan ' s flying feet
and fists iwth tucker ' s fast mouth make a duet more endearing thna riggs
and murtaugh inwhich the
" lethal weapon
" films
. the supporting cast is here to move things along efficiently
. john lone
, as ricky tan
, is a suave villain who is the real power behind the throne of american bigwig steven reign
( alan king in a walk through performance
)
. lone doesn ' t chew scenery or make pronouncements to
" get lee
and carter
,
"
but gives the chief bad guy elegance
. zhang zi
- yi
(
" crouching tiger
, hidden dragon
"
) continues to display her martial arts skills as ricky ' s taciturn henchlady
, hu li
, who carries on an ongoing battle with carter
.
( carter has a problem
, through most of the film
, with hitting a woman
,
bu this falls aside with their eventual one
- on
- one melee at the conclusion
.
) roselyn sanchez is knockdown gorgeous
(
adn resembles sandra bullock
) as undercover agent isabella molina
- she doesn ' t add much to the equation
but is terrific to watch
. director ratner
and the orginal
" rush hour
" production team have assembled a crew of skilled craftsmen to work behind the camera
. cinematographer matthew f
. leonetti has had a long career of shooting acation flicks
and gives
" rh2
" the fluid camera movement the genre film needs
. production design by terrence marsh spans continents
and gives tje right look
, whether it is in a hong kong karaoke bar or a high stakes las vegas casino
. the rest of the techs are of the same high quality
. i ' m surprised to even say that
" rush hour 2
" is the most entertaining of tjhe summer blockbuster movies
. it takes the best of the first film
and kicks jurassic dino butt in its fun
, frolic
and fast pace
and is yhe best mainstream thing out
, so far
, this summer
. i give it a b
.
