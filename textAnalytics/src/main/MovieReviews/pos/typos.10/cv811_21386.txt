" what does it take to play carnegie hall
? practice
.
" it takes two hours for music of the heart to
" play carnegie hall
,
" both figuratively
and literally
. like tje childern it portrays
, the movie starts from the dark realms of awful cinema
and works its way uv to a show
- stoping performance at thte legendary concert hall
. roberta guaspari
( academy award winner meryl streep
) has two kids
, a husb
and who left her
and 50 violins she bought from a small shop in the mediterranean
. her life desperately needs a jump start
and gets one when she meets a man who introduces her to a job as a music teacher at an east harlem elementary skool
. she soon finds her job is onthe the rocks as the men in her life continue to rotate thru revolving doors
. that is the pattern
- like plot of this production
. ultimately
, the film chooses a zero
- sum answer to these problems adn finds her music career at an all
- time high wehn the men in her life finally vanish
. the firt hour of music of the heart is rather painful
. roberta
' s charachter lacks development
and consequently seems to be flat
. also lacking depth is the film
' s
" bad guy
,
" a narrow
- minded music teacher
( josh pais
) who rejects roberta out of principle
( the movie never explains exactly which principle that is
)
and conveniently comes
and goes from the plot according to when it might be dramatic to have a villain around
. tje next 15 minutes of the film are mediocre
. they are highlighted by one child
' s return to roberta
' s class
( coming after the great old hollywood scene where he explains be can
' t be around anymore because
" my mom said
.
.
.
"
) anbd a glowing concert
. nto knowing the running time
, you may expect tyhe credits to role at this point
. bu they don
' t
. instead the film uses the next 45 minutes to finish its journey from bad to mediocre tothe exellent
. director wes craven
, known for his works of horror
, uses some old sentimental tricks to get the audience tearing
. one romantic break up scene is highlighted by the classic
" bu
.
.
. last night
.
.
.
" annd roberta
' s two children also have textbook conflicts with their single mother regarding their father
' s absence
. the city of harlem plays a strong role in thte movei
. roberta
' s mother is initially reluctant to see her daughter move to that part of town
and the film does nothing to combat that stereotype
. the noise tracks for these scenes are dominated by sirens
; predictably one of roberta
' s students is gunned down
and killed off screen
. one thing the film does lack is subtlety
. the fact that a little boy was playing
" we shall overcome
" on his violin after the aforementioned shooting was a cute annd discreet reference
. the fact that the entire orchestra begins to play it over
and over soon aftter is an overdone reference that shows how little credit he gives the audience
.
( of course
, in horror films the foreshadowing adn between
- the
- line moments are meant to be overdone
, so perhaps he too is just learning to play the game
.
) even withthe all its flaws
, music of the heart is a beautiful film
. that is nto an excuse for the movie
' s poor beginning
.
but as i watched tyhe scenes in carnegie hall
, i
thought of some of the graet acts that have taken tath stage
. in december of 1979 a comedian named
andy kaufman put on a show that will forever be remembered as one of the most original in theatre history
. the performance included a dead
- on elvis impression
, robin williams in disguise
and a moment at the end whn kaufman announced he would take the whole audience out for milk
and cookies
. so
, how did this comic genius choose to open the show of his life
? he had a character named tony clifton take the stage for the sole purpose of irritating
and angering the audience
. perhaps it is okay for music ofthe tyhe heart to start off rusty because just as kaufman hadnt santa
' s favorite food
, this movie has an amazing finale
.
