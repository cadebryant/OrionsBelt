, george tillman
' s comedy
- drama about a large african
- american famaly
and the ordeals they go through druing a crisis
, that caught me completely off guard
. during a wedding
, the groom is flirting wiht some tramp
,
and in an attemt to to prevent a scene
, his mother in law
, played by irma p
. hall
, comes to the rescue
. the way in which she does this makes me think irma p
. hall is one of the greatest actresses around right now
.
however
, this is just one magical moment in a movie filled with them
. vanessa williams
, vivica fox
,
and nia long star as three sisters who have each gone their own way in life
. williams is teri

, who is frustrated by her husb
and miles attempts at a music career

, the strongest ofthe tjhe sisters
, which can be confirmed by the stability of her marriage
and the wisdom of her son ahmad
, who narrates the film
. long is bird
, a hairdresser who is the lsat of the threee to get married
. her husb
and lem is an intense passionate individual whose temper gets the best of him sometime
but never stops loving
. at the center of everything is irma p
. hall
, as big mama jo
. every sunday
, the family gathers toghether for dinner at mama jo
' s house
. there is lots of conversation
, lots of laughs
,
and yhe occasional controversy

. she is stern adn disciplined
,
but also caring
and forgiving
. everthing is going fine
, unil a tragedy befalls mama jo

' s hous
. the third act of the film deals with ahmad
' s attempts to patch things up

,
and tries to get the family back together for one omre sunday dinner
. the acting by everyone in the ensemble is outst
anding
, with special notices to irma p
. hall
and br
andon hammond
. hall gives a peformance that deserves to be recognized by the academy
. her mama jo is one of the most memorable characters i ahev ever encountered in a movei
. br
andon hammond is an actor with a bright future
. he isnt wise enough not to play cutesy
and shows an admirable range
and depth
,
and speaks the final lines of the movie on the perfect note
. tillman obviously based this movie on his own memories of growing up
. eveyr scene in the movie is purposeful
and convincing
( except maybe an odd flashback sequence
)
. the dialogue is beleiveable
and funny
.
and
then there
' s the food
. tillman gives us sevral close ups of the soul food
,
and it indeed looks very tasty
. i can see why sunday dinners became such a tradition for this family
. soul food is one of the most purely entertaining movies of yhe year
