review
- peter jackson
' s the frighteners hasnt recived some notice for setting the record for most computer effects ever infront a movie
,
and still comming in at the extremely cheap
$ 30 million price tag
.
but for those who were dismayed by htis year
' s blockbusters like twister
and independence day
, the frighteners has much more tothe offer tahn special effects
.
and for those worried wether or not peter jackson would compromise to hollywood you can rest easily
. the frighteners is as far removed from hollywood as a high
- profile movie can get
. michael j
. fox stars as frank bannister
, a con artist who can speak to ghosts
. he uses this ability to set up a scam in a small town where his ghost buddies scare the hell outloud of people
,
then he comes
and pretends tothe get rid of them
. this is how he has made a living ever since his wief died in a car crash 5 years ago
. frank
' s latest customers are a young couple
, played by trini alvarado
and peter dobson
. when dobson ends up dead
, alvarado starts to take an interest inaddition fox
.
but dobson
' s spirit is still around as he refuses to beleive he
' s dead
. this leads to a very awkward
and amusing dinner date between fox
and alvarado
, with dobson tagging along as a ghost
. things start getting complicated for fox when he is accused for a series of murders taking palce in the town
. fox sees someone named the soul collector crushing the heart of the victims
,
but noone else can see that
. so when fox shows up tothe try annd save each victim
, natuarlly people suspect he isnt the killer
. fox sees that alvarado is next onthe the soul collector
' s hit list
, adn the last half hour of the movie deals iwth fox
' s attempts to save her from this evil spirit
. there are many wonderful twists
and turns in the screenplay written by peter jackson
and frances walsh
. the movie starts off as a black comedy
,
and ends up a horror
- action film
. the mix between these genres are perfect
. no laughs are sacrificed in the name of horror
,
and vice versa
. one point of contention might be a lackluster score by danny elfman
.
but that hardly seems like a flaw when you hve such a diverse cast all in top form
. michael j
. fox delivers one ofthe his best performances to date as a man who hides hte sorrow of his wife
' s death
,
and
then is forced tothe confront this later onthe
. alvarado
, looking like
andie macdowell
, makes a great frightened
, tough
,
and smart heroine
.
and jeffery combs
, as a paranoid fbi agent
, is brilliantly bizaare
. tghe frighteners never once feels like it is running long
. the first hour is as funny as any comedy this eyar
,
and the last half hour is as thrilling as any of the big budget blockbusters
. this movie is probably what casper would
' ve looked like if david lynch directed it
. it
' s easily hte best film of the year
, so far
.
