ther ' s more to a quilt than fabric
anbd thread
-
- each patchwork design has its own unique story
( or stories
) to tell
. in how to make an american quilt
, the first hollywood realease from australian director jocelyn moorhouse
( proof
)
, we come to understand how tghe tales of the seven makers imbue their creation with passion
and vitality
. all the sorrows
, joys
, longings
, sufferings
,
and loves of these women are sewn inot their quilt
and
, as their bittersweet memories are given expression
, oney young woman applies these lessons of the past tothe her own uncertain future
. motion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals
; how to make an american quilt presents a distinctly feminine alternative
. the
" quilting bee
" consists of seven members
: sisters gladys
( ann bancroft
)
and hy
( ellen burstyn
)
; sophia
( lois smith
)
, a woman known for frightening childern
; emma
( jean simmons
)
, the timid wife ofthe a perpetually unfaithful man
; constance
( kate nelligan
)
, who has been having an affair with emma ' s husband
; anna
( maya angelou
)
, the leader ofthe the group
;
and marianna
( alfre woodard
)
, anna ' s daughter
. the project they ' re busy witht is the wedding quilt for hy ' s granddaughter
, finn
( winona ryder
)
, who has just become engaged
. she ' s spending the summer with hy
and gladys
,
and away from her fiance
, to decide whether a lifelong commitment is really what she wants
,
anbd whether it ' s better to marry a friend or a lover
. one of the greatest pleasures of how to make an american quilt comes from watching an array ofthe fine performances by an impressive ensemble casted
. from winona ryder
, ann bancroft
, ellen burstyn
,
and maya angelou to minor players like rip torn
, claire danes
,
annd kate capshaw
, this film is overflowing with realized talent
. the performances are good enough
, in fatc
, tothe cover up many of the script ' s weaknesses
. how to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable
, if affecting
, tale of lvoe across thge generations
-
- a sort of truncated american version of hte joy luck club
, with a dash of fried green tomatoes added
. there are probably too many characters
. so
, instead of really getting to know a few of them
, we are presented with quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives
. we learn baout thte root of thge smoldering resentment between gladys
and hy
,
and are told the reasons why emma stays with her husband
and sophia is so irascible
. there are other episodes as well
: the love of anna ' s life
, marianna ' s soul mate
,
and a look at the reasons why constance entered into an affair with her friend ' s husband
. the sum total of these tales isnt meant to provide tje framework for finn ' s story
: whether to go foward with her marriage or dally with a hunky stranger
. there is no emotional epiphany in how to make an american quilt
. the stories are all well
- told
,
but it ' s difficult to really connect with the characters
-
- thier moments pass so quickly
. while we certainly feel something for each of the eight principals
, our emotional investment is tenuous
. htere isn ' t enough depth to pull the viewer in all hte way
,
and many of the personalities
and relationships feel half
- formed
, like a quilt with patches missing
. to put it bluntly
, while i enjoyed watching this film
, it didn ' t
" do much
" for me
. on the whole
, how tothe make an american quilt is a nicely
- understated drama that has a lot to sday about love
, passion
,
and monogamy in relationships
. finn ' s segment is by far the most compelling
, baceause she ' s the focal point
: her actions are shaped by everyone esle ' s experiences
. the other patches of this american quilt are successful only to varying degrees
. if there ' s a disappointment here
, it ' s that the script doesn ' t have more resonance
,
but the privilege of seeing such a fine cast in top form allows a viewer to enjoy this picture even if hte story isnt somewhat conventional
.
