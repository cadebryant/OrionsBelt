after having heard so many critics describe
" return to me
" as an old
- fashioned hollywood romance
, i kept asking myself gogin into this movie
: what exactly is an old
- fashioned hollywood romance
? what made
" return to me
" old
- fashioned
and old
- hollywood
? wass it the tunes from sinatra
, etc
.
, legendary singers teh senior citizens iin the film constantly harp on
? was it the glamorous
, sophisticated feel
? the charisma of the two leads
? even now i can
' t say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer
, because i haven
' t see that many ood
- fashioned hollywood romances
. i don
' t think any of the romances i
' ve seen have been classified as such
. which leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics
-
-
" return to me
" was old
- fashioned in the sense thast it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic
, the way i perceive cinnamon spice
and apple cider
. it was traditionnal
, magical
. we knew it couldn
' t be too daring
, or have any suprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt tothe throw in
. it was a romance told with such endearing simplicity
, tenderness
,
and love
( from director bonnie hunt
) thast it couldn
' t help
but sparkle with charm dispite its shortcomings
. the film owes a lot of what it has tothe bonnie hunt
' s direction
. from the very first bird
' s eye view of chicago
, zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob ruel
and
( david duchovny
)
, accompanied by the
" return tothe me
" ballad
( by whom
?
)
, we can tell we
' re in for something sweet
. tjhe scenes between the characters are endearing
, truthful
, with just a hint of fantasy
. real people don
' t ect that way
; real peopel aren
' t that nice
. we know all this
,
and
yet we want to believe in these folks
' existence
. the premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale
, bu hunt
' s rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to tje scenario
and tinges everyday urban life whith a hint of the ethereal
. everything is ordinary
-
-
yet beautiful
-
- in this film
.
> from the festive little family restaurant tothe grace
( minnie driver
)
and bob
' s wardrobes
. from the eloquent
, not
- in
- a
- hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints
. from the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen
-
- the most beautiful part
.
" return to me
" has done an excellant job of assembling together a gropu of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family
: the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family acually does exist
. we care for them
, laugh wtih them
, cry with them
; we
' re concerned that tjhe littel boy will pick up cursing from his father
. whatever hunt did
, she brought out thge naturalism in all ofthe the actors
. disappointingly
, david alan grier
' s charlie
,
however much i like him
, was the most flatly
- written
. duchovny here doesnt a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona
-
- with the help of his fellow co
- stars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder
. instead we have a normal guy who when he falls in lvoe shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of
" the x
- files
.
" duchovny
, who is excellent at understatement
and self
- deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable commedic talent on screen
. minnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet
, innocent grace with nothing
but a good heart to offer
.
though an unlikely pair
, duchovny
and driver gradualy warm up to each other as the movie progresses
. hwile
" return tothe me
" functions remarkably as a laff
- out
- loud comedy
, a romantic scenic tour thru chicago
,
and a tearjerker
, the story is set up so the film ends uv having nowhere to develop
. the entire climax of the film hinges on when
and how grace is oging to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wife
' s heart
. we already knwo that there
' s going to be a happy ending
; we feel like we spend the entire film
,
however enjoyably
, in a straight line going towards that point
. as a result bob
and grace click almost too quicklyu
-
- yes
, i know she
' s supposed to have his ex
- wife
' s heart
and everything
-
- it seems too effortless
. the main subject is a love storey
,
and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused
and distract from the turmoil ofthe the two main characters
( whose story might nto have that much meat after all
)
.
however
, in the spirit of
" return to me
,
" it won
' t do to be too picky about how
" old
" hollywood tells its stories
. i loved knowing that this was a labor of love for bonnie hunt
. it shows
. tyhe bottom line
:
" return to me
" is nothing remarkable
,
and
yet its sweetness
, sincerity
,
and charm might touch your heart in ways that yuo hadn
' t imagined
.
