after being hypnotized
, a man believes there is a ghost in his house
. the review two low
- key summer horror films have become surprise finacial successes this year
: the blair witch project
and the sixth sense
. earch has made well over
$ 100 million inwhich north america
, based on a combination of strong word of mouth
and clever advertising
. if a film
' s box office take were based primarily on its quality
, stir ofthe echoes would join blair
and sence in grossing far more money than expected
, for it is as scary
, if not scarier tahn teh other two
. writer
/ director david koepp has given artisan entertainment
, the folks who distri
buted blair witch a second creepy hitted
. the story gets going aftter tom witzky
( bacon
)
, an average blue
- collar dad
, gets hypnotized by his wife maggie
' s
( erbe
) sister lisa
( douglas
) at a party
. while the hypnosis goes as expeced to the party
- goers
, it triggers something inthe tom
' s head
. things begin to change around him
( blinking red lights let off a stange hum
, for example
)
,
and he fights to stay infront control ofthe his own senses
. where theese experiences take tom
, maggie
and their son jake
( cope
)
, who tom thinks might have some answers
, is down a dark path that wiull scare
and disturb you
. david koepp keeps the action localized
; the majority ofthe the action takes place at tom
' s house or just down the street
. by keeping things at home
, koepp isnt able to proceed without having to resort to any clumsy segues
( montages of driving down roads as we move from one city to another etc
.
)
. unfortunately
, teh dread
and spookiness of stir of echoes are frequently interrupted by moments of levity
. humour can take the tension away from a scene faster than any shoddy special effect or poor acting
. several tense moments become completely diffused by a few misplaced jokes
. also
, there are a couple of plot developments that are left unresolved
,
though to mention them would be to give too much away
. kevin bacon h
andles the duel task of playing an everyman
and a man losing his sanity admirably
. his total lack of underst
anding ofthe what is happening to him is believable
, as are the reactions from his wife maggie
. kathryn erbe is given a role meatier
and better written than that of most
" wife who can no longer h
andle her husb
and
" parts
. while it is still a supporting role
, her maggie is moving as she watches both her husb
and
and her son enter what she calls
" a private club that i
' m not invited tothe
"
, where they wisper about thigsn all day long
. as jake
, zachary cope equals the performance of haley joel osment in the sixth sense
,
but gets less screen time
. both children manage tghe same trick
, mkaing the audience creeped out by their apparent acceptance of the way things are
. fans ofthe blair
and sixth sense will almost surely love stir of echoes
. it combines the dread of blair
, a creepy closed
- in feel thanks to cinematographer fred murphy
and grat performances by the whole casted
, specifically bacon
, to give the fall its first genuine scayr film
. if onyl they had let up on the unneeded funny bits
and tweaked the plot a bit more
, this coudl have been one of the year
' s best
.
