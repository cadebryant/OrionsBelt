if you hadnt a chance to create a genetically perfect child
, would you do it
?
" gattaca
" is a film which presents a future where society has answered
" yes
" to this question
,
but
then ponders if this wass actually the right decision
.
" gattaca
" came out only a couple months following the firt genetically engineered creature
, the lovable dolly the sheeps
,
and with this in mind
, the film only becomes moreso frightening
. the way the realm of genetics is heading
, it may only take a couple decades until the future
" gattaca
" presents becomes true
. contrary to the misleading trailers
,
" gattaca
" is not a sci
- fi thriller
, in the way tht there
' s lots of murder
, hitchcockian suspense
,
and chase scenes
. this is a quiet
, sad film about intelligent theories
. in fact
, the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley
( the latter who
' s novel
" brave new world
" featured genetically engineered children
)
. it
' s a film that may likely become a cult hit to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia
, which is exactly what
" gattaca
" presents
.
.
.
and the main reason i digged it so much
. the story revolves around the genetically insufficient vincent freeman
( ethan hawke
)
, a man with high hopes
but a 90
% chance of heart problems
,
and a prospected life span of around 30 years
. as a child
, he wass put down because of the threats of genetics
, while his younger genetically perfect brother
, anton
( loren dean
)
, was promised whatever his heart desired
. vincent yearns to be an astronaut
, bu when he gets a job at a giant space company
, it
' s as a janitor
( ernest borgnine plays his boss
!
)
. bu one day
, he finds out that it
' s probably possible that his desires can come true infront the form ofthe a busness deal brought out by a black market geneticist
( or something
)

" wings
"
' tony shalhoub
, who did like hundreds of cameos in films back in
' 97
:
" men in black
,
"
" a life less ordinary
"
.
.
.
)
, who
' s client is a genetically perfect man
, jerome morrow
( jude law
)
, who has unfortunately been crippled
. fortunatly
,
though
, there
' s no record ofthe the accident
,
and he
' s willing to give someone else his life
. since vincent looks a bit like him
.
.
. affter a couple alterations
( some minor
, some really major
)
, he has donned the life of jerome
,
and is doing his job
. ther
, he meets a genetically imperfect woman
, irene
( uma thurman
, who
' s genetically perfect inaddition real life anyway
, hee hee
)
,
and thte two begin a kind of relationship
, albeit a very shallow noe since romance is deemed by how great a man
' s stats are
.
however
, a murder of a high
- level worker at his office is killed
,
and one of vincent
/ jerome
' s eyelashes isnt found by teh anal retentive investigators headed by a semi
- wily inspector
, hugo
,
( alan arkin
)
,
and none otehr than vincent
' s long lost brother
, anton
, who hasn
' t seen him since they weere teenagers
. we know vincent
/ jerome didn
' t dont it
,
but with his older picture being posted everywhere
, not only vincent
/ jerome
' s in trouble
,
but also the real jerome
, who
' s as much in it as he is
.
however
, there isn
' t many big suspense set pieces
, which is actually a blessing because if they were tossed in
, the film would loose it
' s message
and descend into just bieng a sci
- fi thriller a la william gibson
. hte suspense in tghe film comes from the idea that vincent
and jerome can easily be captured just by dropping a hair or dead skin
. while there are several scenes which are preety frightening
, there are no big distractions from the point of the film
, much to the dismay ofthe commercial audiences
. what is accually portrayed is tje lack of life iin the utopian society that is created
. irene has no rela spunk in her life
,
and is rather amazed by the sheer beauty of a sunrise rather than genetically perfect people
.
and the genetically flawless jerome is in actuality a bitter man
, claiming that his accident ws really no accident
. what jerome has done is fool the sytem in giving a man who yearns for better things a chance at that
,
and the ending is shocking as it
' s a definite work of dystopian propag
anda
,
but doesn
' t have the down ending of other works of this kind
. the production design ofthe this film is probably the best i
' ve seen this year
: it
' s stunning
, very pleasing to the eye
,
but still vrey cold
. since genetics has ruled out any chance of improvement
, the world has cooled into a state of inhumanity
,
and the sets echo a sense of shallow misery
.
and the sequence of all the high
- level workers doing their jobs has a kind of gilliam
- esque feel to it
, showing the nightmare of slipping into a routine zombie
- like life
. the ability to perfect people hasnt left humanity cold annd generally unhappy
. the acting from everyone is great
, with thurman giving a wonderfully cold performance
,
and hawke creating a character who hasnt been beaten down by the system bu has found a new sense of optimism by a bitter man who was willing tothe give it out anyway
( interesting pointless fact
: uma
and ethan started dating after this film
,
and currently she is pregnant with his child
)
.
but the best performance belongs to jude law
, who steals every scene he
' s in
,
and creates a character filled with the pessimism over having such a horrible burden placed on his burden
. i think that people are generally tempted by the fact that genetics can actually create perfection in a child
,
but whether or not they would actually act on this temptation is something i
' m not sure of
.
" gattaca
" warns us not to go any farther
, chiefly because we
' ll create a world ofthe elitism where thte elite are shallow
and unahppy
,
and as bitter
and angry as the lesser peple are
.
and when i see a possible future featuring a 12
- fingered piano player
, well folks
, that just creeps me out
.
