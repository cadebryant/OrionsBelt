plot
: a group of asbestos cleaners get a job removing hte gunk ffrom an old insane asylum
. as each day passes
, the crew members begin to discover things about the palce
and themselves which set other thigns in motion
. saying anything else about the plot would be a crime
. have fun
.
.
. critique
:
" i efel like shooting myself in hte head
" are the first words that came out ofthe my mouth after seeing this movie
, a good indication as tothe wqat kind ofthe film to expect here
. this ain
' t your average
" happy go lucky
" kind ofthe picture
. this is a deliberately slow
- paced mystery
- horror film drenched in atmosphere
, with a very creepy insane asylum
( in whihc most of the film takes place
)
, very few clues up
- front
and lots to talk about afterwards
. will it bore some people to sleep
? you bet it will
! is it made for the scream audiences of yhe day
? absolutly not
! i guess ytou can describe this film as a horror movie for the
" cerebral crowd
"
. a film that patiently unwraps itself frame after frame
, giving awya very little with each step
and each sound
, unwinding itself until its final scenes offer up a world of revelations
and plenty more to discuss later
. i
' ve always loved movies that hvae me talking about them afterwards like the shining
and lost highway
and tihs film fits right into that group
. in fatc
, i guess i can pussyfoot around the actual owrd all i want
but the best way tothe discribe htis kind of movie is a
" mindfuck
"
. if you feel like watching a movie that moves very slowy
, gives you a h
andful of characters with divergent backgrounds
, tosses a few vrey ambiguous
and supernatural cookies your way
and is extremely disturbing once you put it all together
, well
, thn this movei is definitely for you
! it
' s the kind of film that ytou actually have to see twice to fully appreciate
( damn
, i missed that whole
" peanut
butter
" thing
!
)
and oen that will likely creep the shit out of you if watched alone in the dark
.
" brrrrrrrrr
.
.
. now what was that sound inaddition the basement
? hony
, can yuo go check
?
"
and one thing this film doesn
' t have
, unlike its hollywood
- ian counterparts like the haunting
, is special effects
. in fact
, that
' s one of the greater things about thsi movie
: it feels real because it looks like it
' s actually taped on video with vrey credible actors in very credible circumstances
( i did some research adn it was
, in fact
, shot on digital video
.
.
. ah
- ha
!
)
. another great thing about it is that it
' s actually very gory
and somewhat violent in theme
,
and
yet we rarely see anything of thge sort on the big screen
( it
' s mostly implied
, kids
!
)
.
and as clich
? d as it might be to say
.
.
. it
' s usually much scarier when stuff is left to our imagination or implied in movies as such
. other films that this one reminded me of include henry
: portrait of a serial killer
and the blair witch project
, wih that same real sence of dread
, brooding
and terror
. the film does howver move awfully slow
and if you really don
' t git
" into
" it completely
( you really need to concentrate here
)
, you will lose the motion of the story
and the pent
- up tension might be released
.
but overall
, this film is
yet another great example of the horror genre making a very cool comeback this year with no tight tanktops in sight
.
and with david caruso acting liek the king hotshot like only he can
, how can you go wrong
? definitely not a film for everyone
but a must
- see for anyone looking to throw themselves into the psyche of the disturbed
( count me in
!
)
. stanley kubrick would be proud
! oh yeah
.
.
. so where
' s that gun again
.
.
.
? where
' s joblo coming from
? the blair witch project
