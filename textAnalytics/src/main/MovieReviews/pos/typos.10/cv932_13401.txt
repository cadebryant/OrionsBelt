armageddon
, in itself
, symbolizes everything that is wrong in modern filmmaking
. stories have been replaced with special effects
; character development gets overshadowed by bad dialogue
; plotting consists of a bunch of shit getting blown uv
. armageddon is as stupid
, as loud
adn as shallow as any movie you ' ll see come out this summer
, or maybe even any other summer
.
but i loved every freaking minute of it
. believe me
, i ' m just as shocked as you are
. hell
, i don ' t even know why i went to see it in tjhe first place
. the previews weere so annoying that i predicted this was going to be the worst film of the yera
, or at least in the running
. i ' m sorry
,
but
" somebody dial 911
!
!
!
" isn ' t qutie the tagging that ' s going to sell a movie
. it isn ' t too wise eather to market the film using the movie ' s stupidest lines
(
" beam me up scotty
"
- yeah
, that sure is great writing
.
.
.
)
. i mean
, let ' s face it
; armageddon ' s previews rival the truman show ' s as being some of the worst of the year
. neither of them even come close to doing their respective films justice
. of course
, yuo all know the story
. whn the earth is threatend with total annihilation via an asteroid the size of texas
, nasa calls in the us ' s top oil drillers
(
!
) to go into space
(
!
)
and implant a nuclear device eight
- hundered
and someodd feets into the asteroid
(
!
)
. in the coarse of all this mayhem
, we are introduced to some interesting
-
and not so intresting
- characters
. belonging to the former group isnt rockhound
( steve buscemi
)
, a horny little womanizing genius who ' s always full of wisecracks
, even when flying into space at a huge amount of g ' s
. also
, htere ' s the always cool
- as
- hell billy bob thornton as dan truman
, hte bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers
. he kind of reminded me of ed harris in apollo 13
, only without the intensity
and great lines to deliver
.
then on the flip side of the cion is the tired
, contrived character of harry stamper
( bruce willis
, who does the whole movie employing with annoying accent i can ' t qtuie place
)
, the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler
anbd ben affleck as the token lovers you must have in any summer movie
. basically
, that ' s about it
. as i said
, this is hardly a film about plot
. it ' s another summer blockbuster with plot points that are beyond unbelievable
and dialogue
and cahracters that are mostly completely wooden
. case in point
: nasa doesn ' t know that there is even an asteroid on it ' s way until eighteen days before inpact
- huh
? another example
: at one point in the movie
, two children are playing withthe toy space shuttles in front of a poster of kennedy
. how pretentious is that
?
?
?
!
!
! want anohter one
? okay
; before the oil drillers blast off into space
, one of them starts singing
" leaving on a jet plane
"
,
and soon
, all the rest join in
. did michael bay attend the skool of sappy filmmaking before he made this picture
?
but naturally
, all thsi sappiness
, melodrama
and special effects accumulate to one bitchin ' time at the movies
.
and don ' t get me wrong
- despite all of the things i found wrong with armageddon
, i still very much enjoied it
. so even if you don ' t win one of mcdonald ' s free tickets
, it ' s still definetly worth checking out
.
