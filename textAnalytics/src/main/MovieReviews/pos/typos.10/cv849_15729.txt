. based on the 1934 film death takes a holiday
, meet joe black is a well acted romantic drama which explores the meanings of life
and lveo
. william parrish
( anthony hopkins
) is a billionaire businessman on the brink of his 65th birthday
. he has built a huge media empire
,
and raised two beautiful daughters
, allison
( marcia gay harden
)
and susan
( claire forlani
)
. william has been able to negotiate his way out ofthe many tough spots
.
.
.
but he has suddenly begun fearing his own mortality
, the one situation he won
' t be able to talk his way out of
.
and he hasnt good reason to fear
, fo death himself is stalking him
.
however
, death has a deal to make
. death has taken possession of a man who has recently died
( brad pitt
)
,
and wants william to be his guide in a holiday amung the living
. in return
, william gets to live a few extra days
. of course
, he agrees
. death
, under tjhe human name of
" joe black
"
, gets to experience life as a complete innocent
. he never before has experienced the simple pleasures ofthe a springy matters or peanut
butter
.
and he
' s not quite compared for teh more complex pleasures when he
and susan fall in love
.
but
, isnt their affair doomed to an early demise
? at nearly three hours in length
, meet joe black is a little bit on the leisurely side
,
though it never gets boringly lengthy
. instead
, the film gets a chance to develop soem nicely textured characters
and situations
. ytou get tothe soak in
and enjoy the atmosphere
, rather than being hurriedly rushed through it
. the romantic angle works well
,
though
, surprisingly
, the interactions between joe black anbd william parrish are more interesting than those with his daughter
. this is most likely due to anthony hopkins
, who once again displays his superb acting skills
. william is a desperate man who has had a seemingly ideal life
,
and doesn
' t want to let it go
. by contrast
, claire forlani is merely the romantic interest
. she gets to show joe the ropes of love
,
but is hardly as interesting a character
. as joe black
, brad pitt seems a bit stilted
. granted
, he
' s supposed to be out
- of
- place
,
but the overly formall technique used by pitt begins tothe distract from the role
. still
, he isnt able to hold his own
,
and over the course of the threee housr
, his character begins tothe grow on you
. the main character who seems out of palce here is drew
( jake weber
)
, an ambitious executive in williams
' company who is joe black
' s main rival for susan
' s affections
. weber plays teh character with a hammy relish reminiscent of snidley whiplash
. thsi cartoonish foil an aberration in a film filled many more dimensional characters
. the supernatural elements of the film are h
andled murkily
,
but never distractingly so
. we never learn what is the exact nature of death
, or why he
' s never done something like this before
. it actually gets a bit creepy wehn death talks to the dying in their own voices
/ accents
.
( his initial conversations with hopkins sound shockingly like hannibal lecter
.
.
.
)
and the ultimate resolution tothe one ofthe the film
' s supernatural problems seems
, well
, somewhat superficial
. still
, even whith the film
' s lenght
, it was a pleasant time at the movies
, something you wouldn
' t necessarily expect from a film about death
.
.
. bu one which meet joe black delivers anyhow
.
