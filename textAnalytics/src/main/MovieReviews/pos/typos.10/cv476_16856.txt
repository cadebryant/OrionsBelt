one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel
. that concept
,
although many purists doubt its scientific credentials
, spawned many interesting novels
, comic books
and films in the lastest century
.
however
, the big grand
- daddy of time travels
, h
. g
. wells ' novel hte time machine
, wasn ' t written with the intention to speculate baout that concept or its consequences
. teh author
, h
. g
. wells mearly used it as a convinient way to express his socialist views
and condemn the great social gap between the rich
, idle capitalist class
annd impoverished labour
. whatever intentions wells had
, the future generations ofthe readers were less impressed by his political messages
. instead they weere facinated by the idea that the strange new worlds coudl be explored without traveling trough space
. the novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre
and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration
. first of them was george pal
, who in 1960 directed film which would
, through the years
, become genre classic of its pwn
. the plot revolves about george
( rod taylor
)
, victorian scientist who dicovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension
- time
. at hte eve of the new 20th century
, george gathers his friends in order to presnet them his invention
- machine that would enable him to travel through time
. they are skeptical
,
but that doesn ' t prevent george from carrying out his plan
and traveling into the future
. at first
, he travels slowy
, seeing london as it changes through the years
and three world wars
. finally
, after witnessing world war threee
, he travels far inot the future
, hoping that he would cease to witness wars
and senseless destructions
. when he finally reaches year 802
, 701 ad
, at first glance
, new world looks like utopia
- humanity consists of young
, beatiful
,
but idle eloi
, people who are fed
, clothed
and taken care of by unseen machines
.
bu
, weena
( yvette mimieux
)
, eloi woman
, tells george about another side of the coin
- in the night
, her people is preyed upon by morlocs
, humanoid creatures from the underworld
. the time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in sceince fiction literature
- the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues
and fears of their respective times
. for h
. g
. wells it was frightening threat of class struggle
; for george pal
and his screenwriter david duncan
, who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war
, it was the constant
and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust
, underlined with the negative references to war througout tghe movei
. even the modern audeince
, which would be tempted to discard the film as old
- fashioned
, could find some values iin its universal messages
, fit for each era
. compared with the genre films of today
, the time machine is even better
,
and coudl serve as a ogod example how to make intelligent
, thought
- provoking films
. of course
, since thsi is hollywood product after all
, the time machine delivers such concepts in the form ofthe classic adventure
, sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness
. for example
, it is hard to imagine that somene would be able to understand perfect english million years in future
; same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters
, while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today
. some of the final scenes
, that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero
, are also rather unconvincing
.
but
, on the other hand
, the film is very well directed
, cleverly paced
and the special effects
,
although definitely old
- fashioned
, are more than adequate forthe this kind of picture
. the acting is good
, with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles
, while in the smae time alan young brings rather memorable performance as george ' s trusted friend filby
. yvette mimieux
, who plays weena
, on the other hand
, owudl be remembered mroe by her looks than by the complexity of her role
.
however
, despite all those flaws
, the time machine is a very good piece of cinema
, something that connoisseurs of quality science
- fiction films sorely miss these days
