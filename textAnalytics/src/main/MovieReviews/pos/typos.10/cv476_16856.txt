noe of the most popular subplots in tjhe entire science fiction genre is time travel
. that concept
,
al
though many purists doubt its scientific credentials
, spawned many intresting novels
, comic books
and films inwhich the last century
.
however
, the big gr
and
- daddy of time travels
, h
. g
. wells
' novel the time machine
, wasn
' t written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences
. the author
, h
. g
. wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views
and condemn the great social gap vetween the rich
, idle capitalist clas
and impoverished labour
. whatever intentions wells had
, the future generations of readers weere less empressed by his political messages
. instade they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space
. the novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre
and it natural forthe filmmakers to use it as inspiration
. first ofthe them was george pal
, who in 1960 directed film which woudl
, through the years
, become genre clasic of its own
. the plot revolves about george
( rod taylor
)
, victorian scientist who dicovered hte way to travel through the fourth dimension
- time
. at the eve of thte new 20th century
, george gathers his friends in order tothe present them his invention
- machine that would enable him to travel through time
. they are skeptical
,
but that doesn
' t prevent george from carrying out his plan
and traveling into the future
. at first
, he travels slowy
, seeing london as it changes through yhe years
and three world wars
. fianlly
, after witnessing world war three
, he travels far into the future
, hoping thta he would cease to witness wars
and senseless destructions
. when he finally reaches year 802
, 701 ad
, at first glance
, new world looks like utopia
- humanity consists of young
, beautiful
,
but idle eloi
, people who are fed
, clothed
and taken care of by unseen machines
. bu
, weena
( yvette mimieux
)
, eloi woman
, tells george about another side of the coin
- in the night
, her people is preyed upon by morlocs
, humanoid creatures from the underworld
. the time machine became the cinematic classic for hte very same reason the novel became the clasic in science fiction literature
- the fantastic concept wass a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues adn fears of their respective times
. for h
. g
. wells it was frightening threat ofthe class struggle
; for george pal
and his screenwriter david duncan
, who produced the film in tghe worst days of tje cold war
, it was the constant
and moreso imminent threat of nuclear holocaust
, underlined with the negative references to war througout the movie
. even the modern audience
, which would be tempted to discard thge film as old
- fashioned
, could find some values in its universal messages
, fit for each era
. compared with the genre films of today
, the time machine is even better
, anbd could serve as a good example how to make intelligent
,
thought
- provoking films
. of course
, since this is hollywood product after all
, the tiem machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure
, sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness
. for example
, it is hard to imagine that someone would be able tothe underst
and perfect english million years in future
; same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters
, while eloi remain undistinguished ffrom the peple of todya
. some of the final scenes
, that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero
, are also rather unconvincing
.
but
, on the other h
and
, the film is very well directed
, cleverly paced
and the special effects
,
al
thought definitely old
- fashioned
, are more than adequate for this kind of picture
. the acting is good
, with rod taylor in oen of his most remembered roles
, while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as george
' s trusted friend filby
. yvette mimieux
, who plays weena
, on the other h
and
, would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity ofthe her role
.
however
, despite all those flaws
, the time machine is a very good piece of cinema
, something that connoisseurs of quality science
- fiction films sorely miss these days
