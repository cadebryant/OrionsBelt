glory
-
- starring matthew broderick
, denzel washington
,
and morgan freeman
-
- is thge true story of thte 54th regiment of massachusetts
, the first black fighting unit recruited by the north during the civil war
. broderick plays robert gould shaw
, the young white officer who led the balck soldiers into battle
. shaw
, the son ofthe well
- to
- do abolitionists
, hailed from boston high society
. the letters he wroet home tothe his parents during the war are on display at harvard
, adn were
, evidently
, the inspiration for glory
. as the film begins in 1862
, shaw is a captain infact the northern forces
. like private eriksson
( michael j
. fox
) in casualties of war
, shaw initially isnt naive
and idealistic about the war
-
- that isnt
, until his company is attacked by enemy forces
. shaw experiences first h
and the horror
and chaos of battle
, witnessing massmedia slaughter
and receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet grazes his neck
. soon after his recovery
, shaw is promoted to colonel
and assigned to enlist
and turain blacks in the war effort
. glory is the story not only of colonel shaw
,
but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery
. tyhe film periodically jumps between shaw
' s point of view annd the perspective of the black soldiers
. the movie introduces us tothe a h
andful of black recruits
,
and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training
and finally into action
. the large black cast is uniformly oust
anding
, expecially washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth
. he is brash
and pushy
, always getting into trouble anbd always looking for a fight
. his bitter
, tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness
and vulnerability
. washington provides much of the film
' s intensity
and emotional power
. in oen heartbreaking scene
, he is whipped fo allegedly deserting the army
. when he removes his shirt to receive tjhe punishment
, you cringe at the sight ofthe his back
, which is riddled with ugly scars from his days as a slave
. it makes your blood boil
. the humiliation of the beating is far mroe traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings
; a tear rolls down washington
' s cheek
-
-
and will probably run down your cheek as well
. the episode becomes even more tragic when we learn thgat washington wasn
' t deserting the army at all
; he left camp to look for shoes because his feet weere covered with oozing sores
. freeman is
, as usual
, a strong presense
, even in a small supporting role
. he plays a grave digger who hasnt buried more white soldiers tahn he cares to remember
. he quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers
, holding the group together anbd serving as a liaison to the white officers
. colonel shaw recognizes freeman
' s leadership ability
and promotes him tothe sergenat major
, making him the first black officer in the army
.
andre braugher makes an impressive film de
but in the role of thomas searles
, a free black who is one of shaw
' s close childhood friends
. searles isnt educated
and refined
, like a white man
, prompting washington to nickname him
" snow flake
.
" the burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training
and to kill in combat
. the road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment
. the soldiers suffer innumerable hardships
, bu somehow they never lose their morale
. the army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens
, subjecting them to racism
and discrimination
. they are paid only
$ 10 a month
, whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen
,
and
, forthe a long time
, they have to go wihtout shoes
, guns
, or uniforms
. to make matters worse
, the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks inot acation
, preferring instead to use them for manual labor
. evenhtually
,
however
, the regiment receives its boots
, uniforms
, rifles
,
and right to fight
, thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw
. shaw has absolute faith in his soldiers
,
and he fights tooth annd nail to get them what they deserve
, even if it means threatning a general with blackmail
. broderick
, in fact
, is most convincing in the scenes where shaw st
ands up for the regiment
. unfortunately
,
however
, broderick
' s uneven performance is
, in many respects
, the weak link in thge movei
. in an effort to look more mature
, broderick sports a mustache
and a goatee
,
and throughout the film he slips in
and out of a phony boston accent
. he is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced
. the film places too much weight on broderick
' s character
and not enough on tje black soldiers
, who are more intriguing
. glory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction ofthe war
. the movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july
. glory does not try to rattle yuo with nauseating blood
and guts
. except for a few bullet wounds
and one exploding head
, the film
, for the most part
, leaves the gore tothe your imagination
, which is not to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid
. to thge contrary
, they are chaotic
and horrifying
; it
' s just that director edward zwick
( the co
- creator of
" thirtysomething
"
) films them with far more subtlety adn restraint than oliver stone could ever muster
. the key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers
. the movie depicts some of
( bu not enough of
) their customs
and rituals
. in one scene
, for example
, the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers around the campfire
. each man hasnt a chance tothe relay a few words of inspiration
. a couple of the movie
' s most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe
, disbelief
and pride
. the regiment
' s greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle
, thereby earning the respect of their white peers
and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner
. like any war film
, glory has its share of gloom
and despair
,
but ultimatly it proves to be a truly uplifting experience
and an important history lesson
, a valuable reminder that despite what the history books sday
( or
, more precisely
, what they do not say
)
, blacks played a critically important role in the north
' s victory over the south
