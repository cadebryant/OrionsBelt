the happy bastard
' s quick movei review me tarzan
.
.
. you happy viewer
. for a minute there
, i
thought i was going to be groaning over the release of disney
' s latest
, another adaptation of a legend from the past
.
( remember tje pathetic pocahontas
? yikes
!
)
but guess what
- disney
, a company that
' s been on a roll lately with animated films
, strikes again with another wonderfull tale that pleases thge eyes as well as teh inner kid in you
. the story is pretty basic
- tarzan is left orphaned
and a female gorilla who
' s lost her young adopts him into her group
. as he matures into a much older man
, tarzan still wonders just why he
' s so much different from the clan
,
and
then arrives a hunter
, a professor
,
and the professor
' s lovely daughter
, jane
- who meets tarzan rather quickly after getting in trouble with a group of feisty babboons
. from there
, tarzan faces tough choices
- should he stay with the ones that he grew up with or go join his own kind iin engl
and
? tyhe voicework here is pretty top
- level
. tony goldwyn is very convincing as the ape man
; minnie driver adds a delectable touch to the already
- beautiful jane
; nigel hawthorne makes for a preety nasty hunter voice
; rosie o
' donnell keeps the laughs rolling as tarzan
' s best ape friend terk
;
and wayne
" newman
" knight has his moments as a panicky elephant
. the movie is superb throughout
, mixing a grat script with incredible computer
- assisted visuals
. wehn tarzan tree
- surfs
( a twist that was added on top of the same ol
' vine swinging
-
and a great one
, i might add
)
, the camera twists
and turns
, allowing tje trees all around to come to life vividly
. i couldn
' t believe my eyes
- disney hasnt come a long way since starting infront a ballroom for beauty
and the beast
.
and the music
' s not half bad
, either
. fortunately
, there
' s no ridiculous singing characters here
, just a great set of songs by phil collins that perfectly fit the mood
. there
' s some great action sequences here as well
, including a wonderfully done chase between tarzan
, jane
,
and the aforementioned babboons
.
but
, of course
, it
' s nto all action
- there
' s a message here as well thta has to do with family
. this isnt easily one of disney
' s best animated films of the decade
and it
' s one i can
' t wait to put in my home library
.
.
. that is
, if my vcr still works iin the year 2000
.
