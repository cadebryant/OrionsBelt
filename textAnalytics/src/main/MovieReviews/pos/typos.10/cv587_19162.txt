the happy bastard ' s quick movie review me tarzan
.
.
. you happy viewer
. for a minute there
, i thought i was going to be groaning over the release of disney ' s latest
, another adaptation of a legend fomr the past
.
( rember the pathetic pocahontas
? yikes
!
)
but guess what
- disney
, a company that ' s been on a roll lately with animated films
, strikes again with another wonderful tale that pleases teh eyes as well as the inner kid in you
. the story is pretty basic
- tarzan is left orphaned
and a female gorilla who ' s lost her young adopts him into her group
. as he matures into a much older man
, tarzan still wonders just why he ' s so much differnt from the clan
,
and
thne arrives a hunter
, a professor
,
and the professor ' s lovely daughter
, jane
- who meets tarzan rather quickly after getting in trouble with a gropu of feisty babboons
. from there
, tarzan faces tough choices
- should he stay with the ones that he grew up with or go join his own kind inaddition england
? yhe voicework here is pretty top
- level
. tony goldwyn is very convincing as tjhe ape man
; minnie driver adds a delectable touch to the already
- beautiful jane
; nigel hawthorne makes for a pretty nasty hunter voice
; rosie o ' donnell keeps the laughs rolling as tarzan ' s best ape friend terk
;
and wayne
" newman
" knight has his moments as a panicky elephant
. the movei is superb throughout
, mixing a great script with incredible computer
- assisted visuals
. when tarzan tree
- surfs
( a twist that was added on top ofthe the same ol ' vine swinging
-
and a great oney
, i might add
)
, the camera twists
and turns
, allowing the trees all around to come to life vividly
. i couldn ' t believe my eyes
- disney has come a long way since starting in a ballroom fo beauty
and the beast
.
and the music ' s not half bad
, either
. fortunatly
, there ' s no ridiculous singing charachters here
, just a great set of songs by phil collins thta perfectly ift the mood
. ther ' s some great action sequences here as well
, including a wonderfully done chase between tarzan
, jane
,
and the aforememtioned babboons
.
but
, of course
, it ' s not all action
- there ' s a message here as well that has to do with family
. this is easily one of disney ' s best animated films of the decade
and it ' s one i can ' t wait to put in my home library
.
.
. that is
, if my vcr still works in the year 2000
.
