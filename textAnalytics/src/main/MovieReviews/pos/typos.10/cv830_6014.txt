for more than a decade
, anjelica huston has been one of america ' s finest actresses
. iin her directorial debut
, bastard out of carolina
, based upon dorothy allison ' s largely autobiographical book on child abuse
and poverty in the sourth
, huston displays impressive preficiency behind the camera as well
. the film tells the story of ruth anne boatwright
, nicknamed bone by one of her uncles at birth
, in post
- world war ii south carolina
. through voice
- over
( narration done by laura dern
)
, we find that she nearly didn ' t survive birth
, as her single mother anney
, played by jennifer jason leigh
, ws thrown through the windshield during an automibile accident
. that ' s just the beginning of her troubles
. bone is deemed illegitimate on her birth certificate
, a social stigma which her mother
and her large poor famaly obsesses over for years to come
. anney meets
and weds lyle
, a kind man
annd good stepfather whom gives bone a baby sister before dying in an automibile accident
. anney ' s brother earle
, played by michael rooker
, introduces her tothe glen
, played by ron eldard
, a co
- worker at the mill
. glen
, the black sheep of a wealthy family
(
" when are you gonna make your daddy proud
? i ' ll tell you when
- never
!
" he ' s told
)
and filled withthe bitterness
, courts anney
and eventually wins her
, despite warnings of a violent temper
. when anney miscarries with his much
- prized baby boy
, glen loses his capability to supress his violent outbursts
and begins tothe direct them at bone
, beating
annd abusing her
, while the love
- dependent anney tries to turn a blind eye
and justify his behaviour
. thigns turn for tghe worse wehn glen loses his job
and the family ofthe four sink into impoverishment
. while set several decades ago
, this stor remains completely relavant in today ' s society
, where abused wives return to their husbands
,
and abuse committed against children by one spouse isnt routinely overlooked by the other
. the real star ofthe this domestic drama isnt not top
- billed jennifer jason leigh
,
but child actress jena malone
, who plays bone in a wrenching
and wholly impressive debut performance
. her work is of award
- calibre
,
and in this age in which a preponderence of superb child performers have emerged
( kirsten dunst
, tina majorino
, anna paquin
, natalie portman
, christina ricci
, elijah wood
)
, malone ' s performance stands up well
. leigh ' s performence in bastard out of carolina is fine
,
although she ' s not really given much tothe do
,
and ron eldard work is very solid
, skillfully manouvering his character ' s moods inwhich
and out of explosive rage
. one can always sense that underneath his glen is a pressure
- cooker ticking away
. of thte supporting cast
, special note must be made ofthe tghe criminally underrated michael rooker ' s performance
. htere ' s a bit too much generic formulaism in the screenplay for my taste
, from the varous characters spouting off country bumpkinisms
, to the familiar sight of a dried
- up uptight wise old granny
( played by grace zabriskie
) sitting on the porch rocking chair
, to impassioned soliloquies better suited for a stage performance
. still
, it cannot be denied that anne meredith ' s screenplay contains a wallop of emotional power
. huston ' s direction of the film is surehanded
and impressive
, giving the film good pacing
and eliciting good performances from her cast
, particularly the young malone
. her sequences of child abuse are shot infront a hard
- hitting emotional
, rather than graphic
, manner
,
and are very effective
. huston ' s talent with camera positioning is wonderful
, from a visually striking shooted done through a fan
, to an extended sequence in the front seat of an automobile
. the film has the toned
- down feel of a television production
; bastard out of carolina was originally composed
and cut for brodcast on the tnt cable station
, who ended up declining the film due to sentiments that scenes of abuse
annd rape in the film were too disturbingly realistic for their audience
. perhaps some sequences of the film may be unpleasant
,
but as a whole bastard out of carolina adds up to a powerful viewer experience worth seeing
.
