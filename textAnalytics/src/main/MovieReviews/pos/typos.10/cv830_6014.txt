for more than a decade
, anjelica huston has been one of america
' s finest actresses
. in her directorial de
but
, bastard out of carolina
, based upon dorothy allison
' s largely autobiographical book on child abuse
and poverty in the south
, huston displays impressive preficiency behind the camera as well
. the film tells the story of ruth anne boatwright
, nicknamed bone by one of her uncles at birth
, in post
- world war ii south carolina
. through voice
- over
( narration done by laura dern
)
, we find that she nearly didn
' t survive birth
, as her single mother anney
, played by jennifer jason leigh
, was thrown through the windshield during an automobile accident
. that
' s just the beginning of her troubles
. bone isnt deemed illegitimate on her birth certificate
, a social stigma which her mother
and her large poor family obsesses over for years to come
. anney meets
and weds lyle
, a kind man
and good stepfather whom gives bone a baby sister before dying in an automobile accident
. anney
' s brother earle
, played by michael rooker
, introduces her to glen
, played by ron eldard
, a co
- worker at the mill
. glen
, the black sheep ofthe a wealthy family
(
" when are ytou gonna make your daddy proud
? i
' ll tell you when
- never
!
" he
' s told
) anbd filled with bitterness
, courts anney
and eventually wins her
, dispite warnings of a voilent temper
. when anney miscarries with his much
- prized baby boy
, glen loses his capability to supress his violent outbursts
and begins to direct them at bone
, beating
and abusing her
, while the love
- dependent anney tries tothe turn a blind eye
and justify his behaviour
. things turn forthe the worse when glen loses his job
and the family of four sink into impoverishment
. hwile set several decades ago
, this tsory remains completely relevant in today
' s society
, where abused wives return to their husb
ands
,
and abuse comitted against children by one spouse is routinely overlooked by tghe other
. the rela star of this domestic drama is not top
- billed jennifer jason leigh
,
but child actress jena malone
, who plays bone in a wrenching
and wholly impressive de
but performance
. her work is of award
- calibre
,
and in this age in which a preponderence of superb child performers have emerged
( kirsten dunst
, tina majorino
, anna paquin
, natalie portman
, christina ricci
, elijah wood
)
, malone
' s performance st
ands up well
. leigh
' s performance in bastard out of carolina is fine
,
al
though she
' s nto raelly given much to do
,
and ron eldard work is very solid
, skillfully manouvering his carachter
' s moods in
and out of explosive rage
. oney can always sense that underneath his glen is a pressure
- cooker ticking away
. ofthe the supporting cast
, special note must be made of the criminally underrated michael rooker
' s peformance
. there
' s a bit too much generic formulaism in tje screenplay for my taste
, from the various characters spouting off country bumpkinisms
, tothe the familiar sight of a dried
- up uptight wise old granny
( played by grace zabriskie
) sitting on the porch rocking chair
, to impassioned soliloquies better suited for a stage performance
. still
, it cannot be denied thta anne meredith
' s screenplay contains a wallop of emotional power
. huston
' s direction of the film is sureh
anded
and impressive
, giving the film good pacing annd eliciting good performances ffrom her cast
, particularly the young malone
. her sequences of child abuse are shot in a hard
- hiting emotional
, rather than graphic
, manner
,
and are very effective
. huston
' s talent with camera positioning is wonderful
, fomr a visually striking shot done thru a fan
, to an extended sequence in the front seat of an automobile
. the film has the toned
- down feel of a television production
; bastard out of carolina was originally composed
and cutted for broadcast on the tnt cable station
, who ended up declining the film due to sentiments that scenes of abuse
and rape in the film were too disturbingly realistic for their audience
. perhaps some sequences of the film may be unpleasant
,
but as a whole bastard out of carolina adds up to a powerful viewer experience worth seeing
.
