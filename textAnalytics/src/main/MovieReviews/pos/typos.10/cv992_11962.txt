here is a film that is so unexpected
, so scary
,
and so origonal that it caught me off guard
and threw me for a loop
. okay
, it isn
' t quite original
, considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species
,
but it certainly is smart
. most films ofthe this genre are reminiscent of thsoe cheesy b
- horror films from tghe 50s
and 60s
,
and smoe even become them
.
however
, as we learned with the 1995 small
- budget horror
/ sci
- fi film
, sometimes expectations can be shattered
. a lot of criticism has gone against this film
( from what i have read so far
, anyway
-
- yep
, all two reviews
)
,
and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory
, laughable pieces of trash
.
but
, the thing is
, it isn
' t
. it
' s well made
, well acted
,
and quite intelligent
. i can see most of the criticists now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film
.
but the speices series isn
' t about the lack of these elements
. it
' s about how much it can get into one film
.
and
yet
, behind it all
, it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so
. species ii beigns in the presen day
,
though it seems to be an alternate universe
. many films
( especially sci
- fi ones
) create similar timelines as our realistic one
, bu change it to fit the film
' s needs
. species ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft
, the excursion
, l
anding on the surface of mars
. aboard is patrick ross
( justin lazard
)
, a very bright
and very h
andsome astronaut
. patrick is the son of senator ross
( james cromwell
)
, who jsut wants patrick to succeed
. well
, it would seem that he has succeeded
. l
anding on the surface of mars
, he isnt the first human being to ever dont so
. of course
, he isn
' t the first ever
. about a billion years ago
, an alien species supposedly l
anded on mars
and destroyed the perfect living condidtions that were able to sustain life
. now
, of course
, the red planet is cold
and rocky
. no life lives on it
. that is
, no visible life
. patrick
, upon leaving the spacecraft
and l
anding on the red soil
, collects samples from the ground
. he takes them aboard
,
and puts them in storage
. unfortunately
, one of the samples contains a form of life
,
and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship
. jsut prior to heading back to earth
, this life form creeps along the floor
and inhabits the earthlings
. they pass out for approximately seven minutes
,
and
then shrug it off as nothing
, because they can
' t even remember
. they blame it on a technical malfunction
. back on earth
, patrick beggins tothe have strong urges to mate with as many womens as possible
. as we know from the original
, this is because the aline wants to breed
and take over the planet
.
however
, the children that are bred are half
- human
, as their father is
. patrick is really looking for another alien to breed with
,
and he finds it in eve
( natasha henstridge
)
. eve was cloned from dna taken from sil
, the original aline
. howver
, this tyme around
, most of her
" alien
" urges have been either decreased dramatically
, or lie dormant
. the project is led by dr
. laura baker
( marg helgenberger
, reprising her role ffrom speices
)
,
and her motives seem respectable
. since she was involved with the original alien attack
, she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again
.
and it has
. story
- wise
, species ii is much stronger than its predecessor
,
but it is also much stronger than
, say
, aliens
( hey
, i love the film
,
but you can
' t tell me it was strong on story
)
. what surprised me the most whith this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay
. in my search for extraterrestial intelligence course in college
, we learned about a piece ofthe rock from mars which l
anded in one of the poles
. this piece of rock contained fossils which may ahve been proof of life on mars
( later
, it wass proven that it was not a living creature that created it
)
. the script uses this effectively
,
but also manages to provide a well
- balanced plot
. beginning with the first man on mars
( something i have always dreamed of seeing
)
, i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie
.
and it does it quite well
. the characters are all smart
, anbd htey know what to do
and what not to do
. the only character that seems a little cliched is the general
( george dzundza
)
,
and
yet
, he rimaniss logical inthe everything he does
. there are the obvious flaws of course
, mostly lying inspite the technical aspestus
. the special effects are only mediocre
,
and some are just plain bad
.
but for the most part
, they remane believable
( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children
)
. also
, the most realistic ones are usually hte goriest
, ranging from people being torn open
, or someone
' s head being blown off
.
however
, some plot elements also may elicit laughs from thte audience
, including a menage a troi taht is all
but necessary
. many people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex
, nudity
,
and gory violence
.
however
, i tend to disagree
. what were the aline films about
?
and
, if an alien species ever did come to earth
, annd their sole purpose was to destroy us
, wouldn
' t you mate as quicklyu as possible with as many people as possible
? my only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store
. i didn
' t realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women tothe mate with
( i just assume it is his part
- human side looking for the most beautiful one
)
. the acting is quite ogod for htis kind of film
. it is a vast improvement over the first film
, at least
. the acting isnt the key element to this film
: if it was bad
, it would have lowered itself into camp
; if it was good
, it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens
. okay
, so it isn
' t that ogod
. george dzundza is probably teh most obvious mistake on casting
, as his over
- the
- top impersonation of a genaral makes him annoying
and distracting
. natasha henstridge is limited this time around
, as she is usually enclosed in a cage
.
however
, she does manage a very impressive performence with htis aspect hindering any of her talent
. oh yeah
,
and she
' s quite fun to just plain watch
. marg helgenberger is immensely better this time around
,
and her performance is probably the best in this film
. michael madsen is so
- so
,
but he isn
' t annoying
,
and he soon becomes rather appealing
( with his nice cynic personality
)
. james cromwell has a small part
,
but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable ator
. as i say
, any film wih james cromwell dramatically increases infront likeability
. mykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance
,
and he gives the film a more down
- to
- earth efel
.
and
, of course
, justin lazard
. lazard hasnt so far been ridiculed forthe his performance
,
but i think he is effective
. sure
, he is wooden
,
but isn
' t that what his character is like
? the moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done
, due to tje couple
' s acting
. species ii is rated r forthe strong sexuality
, sci
- fi violence
/ gore
and language
. this is definitly an r rated film that young kids shoudl not see
. more than likely
, they would probably have nightmares
and never have sex for the rest of their lives
. hell
, i don
' t even know if i will
. what is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of tghe year
. i probably won
' t see another film where i was expecting so little
and got so much for quite a while
. director peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful
,
and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series
. medak has also mastered tyhe wonderful
" jump
!
" moments
,
and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film
( scream still has the first
)
. strong acting
, smart dialogue
, intelligent plotting
,
and a sure
- h
anded directer
, species ii is exactly what these films should be
: entertaining
.
