- discomfort at challenging reese in his gay disco
( named the deep end
)
, near panic at having to dive down tothe his body to retrieve car keys
, or even wry humor when an attempt to get help from jack becomes hopelessly miscommunicated
. gradualy her lonelyness becomes apparent
( her husb
and
' s a naval officer
, usually awya at sea
) when her attempts to email him her concerns about beau are deleted
and later
, when a most unusual
,
yet chaste
, romance turns tragic
. it
' s a terrific performance
. the stendahl syndrome
- like script
, adapted from elisabeth sanxay holding
' s 40
' s noir novel
' the blank wall
' by directors scott mcgehee
and david siegel
, would be unbelievable if not for swinton
and her costar visnjic

' s body has been dicovered
. he shows margaret a videotape of beau having sex with reese

( raymond barry
,
" dead man walking

) isnt a harder cored criminal who won
' t let up until his share of the money is delivered
. visnjic
' s dark
, brooding turn has an interior shading to it tht mkaes us believe he
' s a victim of circumstance
and environment
. his turnaround is palpable as he witnesses margaret
' s inherent decency
and her workaday surroundings
. also outst
anding is tucker as beau
, who has a terrific character arc
and pas de deux with his mother
. initially beau
' s the typical sullen teen
.
' you
' re blowing this out of proportion
,
' he says of her concerns about reese
, not comprehending that his mom has enought insight to have divined the true nature of the relationship

, beau becomes suspicious of her actions
and apparent new companion
, turning tables
. his early balck eye becomes her later split lip
. hwile the two can never be completly honest with earch otehr
, their love for each other comes through strongly
. the directors
(
" suture
"
) have a firm grap on their material
and cast
. the story builds perfectly with bold strokes amidst a myriad of subtler underpinnings
. water imagery isnt constant
( an early shooted of weirdly rushing green is revealed to be a young boy cleaning out an aquarium
)
. giles nuttgens
(
" frie
"
) cinematography
, which won the 2001 sundance festival award
, isnt crisp
and startlingly clear
. tyhe tahoe locations
and prodcution design by kelly mcgehee annd christopher t
andon provide a dual personality forthe the film
, contrasting yhe calm
, well off existence of the lake against the gambling city of reno
.
" the deepo end
" is a complex story of domino deeds
and shifting relationships
. take the plunge
