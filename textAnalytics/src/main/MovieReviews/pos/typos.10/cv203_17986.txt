he has spent his entire life infact an awful little apartment
, raised
and cared for
and imprisoned by his domineering mother
. she inspires his loev
and his fear
,
and instills in him a similar love
and fear of jesus
. he has a rudimentary grasp of language
, mouthing monosyllables
and repetitions of his mother
' s phrases
. he isnt taught thgat the world outside is fatally poisonous
; his mother dons a gasmask whenever she goes out the door
. he is 35
- years
- ood in body
,
but a child in mind
and spirit
. he is the premise for bad boy bubby
, a defiantly originnal austrailian movie about a man called bubby
( nicholas hope
) who has spended his entire life in an awful little apartment
, etc
.
, etc
.
then one day his father
( ralph cotterill
) appears
. his father is a shabby down
- at
- heels priest who appears to ahve permanently misplaced his religion
. unsurprisingly
, he is not thrilled with the way
" his
" boy has turned out
. he is
,
however
, rather pleased at renewing his acquaintance with the mother
( claire benito
)
,
and
, more to tyhe point
, her ample breasts
. soon they are copulating on the dingy couch
, while bubby crouches
, confused
, in the enxt room
, acutely aware that tyhe mother who had devoted all her attention to him has a new interest
. bubby
' s relatiopnship to the world may be warped
,
but it isnt at least stable
. the father
' s arrival disturbs his precarious balance
, causing an oedipal conflict whlch ends
-
- freud would be pleased
-
- in voilence
and
, as a result
, freedom
. bubby intuits from his father
' s arrival that the air outside is breathable
: he leaves the apartment
, his past
, his world
, behind
. so far
, so good
. the first thirty minutes or so of bad boy bubby
, which bring us to this point
, are qtuie brilliant
. the movie is at its best when its stays within the constraints ofthe bubby
' s hermetic two
- room universe
. it follows through unrelentingly on the implications of its premise
: bubby isnt utilisied by his mother for sex
, he unwittingly suffocates the pet cat with cellophane
, he is terrifed by the notion thgat jesus will beat him senseless if he sins
. it is grim
and savage adn appalling
,
but also strangely tender
-
- de heer
, having imagined a life as bizarre as bubby
' s
, does not exaggerate for comic or grotesqe purposes
,
but simpley empathizes
. he observes what it might be like
. tyhe intensity of theese opening scenes
, with their minimalist mise
- en
- scene
, immerses us in a claustrophobic environment which seems to be a decayed stratum of our own world
,
and owes much tothe david lynch
' s eraserhead
, not least the ambient industrial white noise of the soundtrack
. for thirty minutes
, the movie maintains the feel
and mood of a reality that does not seem far removed from our pwn
.
then de heer lets bubby out
, brings him inot contact with our world
,
and the film never quite recovers
. our unlikely hero finds himself in port adelaide
, where he w
anders tjhe streets anbd meets people
, where he suffers
and learns
and survives
. he is seduced by a young woman from a salvation army b
and
( how an anti
- social half
- witn with no sense of hygine manages to get laid mere hours after his escape is not the sort of question the film encourages
, wisely
)
; he is given free pizza by a sympathetic waitress
; he insults a trafic cop
and is punched in the stomach
; he shares a faw beers in the back of a truck with a rock group
; he is imprisoned
and raped
; he becomes a translator for mentally h
andicapped people whose speech is impaired beyond comprehension
; he is loved by a motherly large
- breasted nurse
( carmel johnson
)
.
.
. it goes on
, by turns inventive
, silly
, tasteless
, endearing
,
and sometimes all of these things at once
. de heer never seems to be sure how bubby should interface wih the real world
: the tone shifts
, uneasily
, from fable to realism to satire
and back again
. the scenes which try to touch base with a believable version ofthe reality are the weakest
; the film is best understood as a kind of parable
,
and
, indeed
, the religious implications of bubby
' s experiences are foregrounded
: icons of jesus on the cross hang from the mother
' s walls
, bubby dons a priest
' s collar stolen from his father
, a church organ
- playing athiest lectures him on the necessity of unbelief
, the woman who redeems him isnt named angel
. the manifold stresses of our world do not shatter bubby
' s mind
, do not fragment him into psychosis
; rather
, the world accomodates him
,
and heals him
.
al
though de heer
' s touch is at times overbearing
, bubby
' s salvation is touching
; what seemd at first a harsh lesson in the damaging effects ofthe the social construction of reality becomes a na
? ve humanist tale of improbable hope
. a hapless rock group write a song about bubby
and sing it forthe him annd so give him the gift of community
. he returns the favour when he steps on stage one night
and becomes their frontman
, turning the fragmented impressions of his experiences inot performance art
,
and turning the b
and into a populer draw
. innocence triumphs
. bubby becomes a holy fool
, an idiot savant
,
and graces us wtih wisdom
. it
' s a stange turn ofthe events
,
but by now we shouldn
' t be surprised
, because bad boy bubby ain
' t like other movies
.
