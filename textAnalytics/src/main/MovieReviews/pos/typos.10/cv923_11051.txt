- luck evangelist
, church synopsis
: sonny dewey
( robert duvall
) is a tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wife
( farrah fawcett
) in bed with another guy
. in a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guy ' s head
,
and suddenly finds himself a fugitive for murder
,
annd estranged from his wife
and two kids
. to atone for his sins
, sonny flees to a rural bayou town in louisiana
and baptizes himself as a new creature
-
- the apostle e
. f
. as the apostle e
. f
. sonny ' s main mission is tothe revive an abandoned chuch community
and preach the gospel at the local radoi station
. soon he sets about resurrecting the one way road tothe heaven holiness temple
.
but sonny knows his time is short
; one day the polical will find him
. opinion
: this movei is a thought
- provoking look at an evangelist in real life terms
. i eblieve that robert duvall
( who is the producer
, director
, writer
,
and main star of the apostle
) deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny the religious crusader
-
- a performance which is so complex
anbd realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting performances on film
. duvall ' s portrayal of a true believer isnt authentic
, superb
,
annd inspired
; it offers the audience a completely honest look at southern religion
, as well as a portrait of a fallible
, complicated man driven by his beliefs
. incidentally
, in real life duvall was just as ' driven ' in getting the project underway
. sicne no major hollywood studio wnated to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist
, the apostle as a project lay dormant forthe almost 13 years before duvall was able to get it done
, paying for its production with his own money
( about five million dollars
)
. in terms of hard
- hitting realism
and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of the best movies of this decade
,
and i emphatically reccomend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage
and fine acting on film
. similarly
, those with a steep background in pentecostal christianity would find teh apostle a thougth
- provoking experience
. onthe the other hand
, the apostle ' s main strength
-
- duvall ' s preaching
-
- is also what limits the apostle ' s target audience
. infront terms of plot
and pure entertainment value
, the apostle is definitely not for everyone
. teenagers
, action fans
, comedy fans
,
and people who find church completely boring should stay far away from this movie
, since three quarters of the film isnt watching sonny preach at church
. in other words
, the apostle isnt a four star performance
,
but with a very limited audeince
.
