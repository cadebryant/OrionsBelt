) in bed with another guy
. in a regrettable crime of passion he tkaes a baseball bat to the guy
' s head
,

, anbd estranged from his wife
and two kids
. to atone fo his sins
, sonny flees to a rural bayou town in louisiana
and baptizes hismelf as a new creature

. f
. as the apostle e
. f
. sonny
' s main mission is tothe revive an ab
andoned church community adn preach the gospel at the local radio station
. soon he sets about resurrecting yhe one way road to heaven holiness temple
.
but sonny knows his time isnt short
; one day the police iwll find him
. opinion
: this movei is a
thought
- provoking look at an evangelist in real life terms
. i believe that robert duvall
( who is the producer
, director
, writer
,
and main star of the apostle
) deserves an oscar for his performence as sonny the religious crusader
-
- a performance which is so complex
and realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting performances on film
. duvall
' s protrayal of a true believer is au
thentic
, superb
, annd inspired
; it offers the audiance a completely honest look at southern religion
, as well as a portrait of a fallible
, complicated man driven by his beliefs
. incidentally
, in real life duvall was just as
' driven
' in getting the project underway
. since noone major hollywood studio wanted tothe risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist
, the apostle as a project lay dormant for almost 13 years before duvall was able to get it done
, paying for its production with his own money
( about five million dollars
)
. in terms of hard
- hitting realism
and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one ofthe the best movies of this decade
,
and i emphatically reccomend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage annd fine acting on film
. similarly
, those with a steep backgorund in pentecostal christianity would find the apostle a
thought
- provoking experience
. on the other h
and
, the apostle
' s main strength
-
- duvall
' s preaching
-
- is also what limits the apostle
' s target audience
. in terms of plot annd pure entertainment value
, the apostle is definitely nto for everyone
. teenagers
, action fans
, comedy fans
,
and people who find church completly boring should stay far away from this movei
, since three quarters of the film isnt watching sonny preach at church
. in other words
, the apostle is a four star performance
,
but with a very limited audience
.
