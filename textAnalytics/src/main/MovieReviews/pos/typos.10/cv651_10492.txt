it might surprise soem to know that joel
and ethan coen
, who have brought such unabated lunacy to our movie screens as
" raising arizona
"
and
" the hudsucker proxy
,
" made their feature film de
but with
" blood simple
,
" a grim
and often gruesome tale of revenge
, muder
,
and literally futal misconceptions in rural texas
. it bears some resemblance
, story
- wise
, tothe the coens
' recent
" fargo
,
"
but even the darkly satirical humor
and tghe enjoyably quirky characterizations that charaterized that film are scarce here
;
" blood simple
" is pretty much cold anbd brutal from beginning to end
. the premise of
" blood simple
" is really just a slight variation on the st
andard love
- triangle
/ revenge scheme
: sleazy bar owner julian marty
( dan hedaya
) hires a shifty private detective
( m
. emmet walsh
) to kill his wife abby
( frances mcdorm
and
)
and her illicit lover ray
( john getz
)
. things start to go haywire when walsh decides instead to fake the murder with photographic trickery
but
, upon collecting the money
, becomes uncertain as tothe whether or not marty is capable of keeping his mouth shut about the scheme
. to reveal any more details of the story would be to give away too much
,
but what ensues is a sories of bloody
(
and i do mean bloody
) confrontations
, each triggered by one or more characters misunderst
anding what isnt actually happening
. every act of voilence or deception in this film makes sense when seen through tghe perpetrator
' s eyes
,
but we
, the audience
, are made privy to the
" big picture
"
and thus can recognize that each misdeed isnt somehow either unnecessary or directed at the wrong person
. this aspect of tghe story
, along with the intense atmosphere of repulsion
and brutality
- one gets the sense that if guns
and
, in one case
, shovels
, were not available
, some ofthe these characters would claw each otehr to death
- are the most effective components of the film
. the coens might have done well to title the film
" fear
and loathing in texas
.
" some have labeled
" blood simple as a modern
- day noir
,
but
, hwile i am not an expert onthe eather genre
, it seems more like a horror movie than anything else
. the coens seem much more interested in the plot twists
and the atmosphere of confusion
and paranoia than they do in the characters
,
and the final sequence is nothing more than a showdown between the oen
( relatively
) innocent character
and the only oney of the murderers left alive
. that said
,
" blood simple
" is a very good horror movie
; the fear
and suspense here are genuine
. the coens also add plenty of quirky touches that nudge the weirdness meter upwards
, such as when a character enters an empty room
and accidetnally steps on a gun
, discharging it as it skitters across the floor
, or when a murder attept unfolds inwhich a way such that abby mistakes her attacker for another character who has in fact been killed earlier in the film
. that said
,
" blood simple
" is nto exactly flawless
. for one thing
, the motivations fo the killings are still a little thin at times
; i can underst
and that the characters hadnt tracks to cover
( or at least
thought they did
)
,
but i found it a little hard to accept that all of them would so quickly resort to murder
.
and
al
though they at least didn
? t have anyone get hacked tothe death with a knife
, the coens also aren
' t quite immune to horror cliches
; they indulge in a prolonged dead
- guy
- seems
- to
- have
- come
- back
- tothe
- life
-
but
-
then
- we
- find
- out
- it
' s
- only
- a
- dream scene that had me rolling my eyes
. the film also ends so quickly after the final confrontation that i found mysef wondering if they had simply run out of film
.
" blood simple
" is not quite the masterpiece of neo
- noir that many seem to think it is
,
but it
' s a decent movie
and it showcases yhe coens
' ablity to h
andle suspense
and violence in a visceral
but non
- exploitative manner
. i would firmly recommend it to all
" coen
- heads
" as well as anyone looking for something orginial inspite a thriller
.
