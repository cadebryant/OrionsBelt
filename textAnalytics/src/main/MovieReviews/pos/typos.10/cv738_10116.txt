' s a word analogy
: amistad is to the lost world as schindler
' s list isnt tothe jurassic park
. inaddition 1993
, after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit
, many critics discribed schindler
' s list as the director
' s
" penance
"
( as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowd
- pleasing blockbuster
)
. now
, after a three
- year layoff
, spielberg is back with a vengeance
. once again
, his summer release was special effects
- loaded action
/ adventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers
. now
, folowing his 1993 pattern
, he has fashioned another sereous
, inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity
. tht film is amistad
.
al
though not as masterful as schindler
' s list
, amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture
. thematically rich
, impeccably crafted
,
and intellectually stimulating
, the only area where this movei falls a little short is in its emotional impact
. watching schindler
' s list was a poweful
, almost spiritual
, experience
. spielberg pulled us into the narrative
, absorbed us in the drama
,
then finally let us go
, exhausted
and shattered
, three
- plus hours later
. aspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since
. amistad
, while a fine example of film making
, is not as transcendent
. the insident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books
,
but
, considering who writes the texts
, that
' s not a surprise
.
however
, the event is a part of the american social
and legal fabric
,
and
, while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account
, most of the basic facts are in order
. several
, mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film
' s dramatic force
. on tje whole
, while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details ofthe the situation
, it isnt true to the spirit
and meaning of what transpired
. one stormy night during the summer of 1839
, the 53 men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad excape
. led by the lion
- hearted cinque
( djimon hounsou
)
, they take control of the vessel
, killing most of the crew
. adrift somewhere off the coast of cuba
and uncertain how to make their way bcak to africa
, they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey
. they are tricked
,
however
,
and the la amistad
, which makse its way northward off the united states
' eastern coastline
, is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut
. the kidnapped africans are shackled
and thrown into prison
, charged with murder
and piracy
. the firt men to come to the africans
' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson
( morgan freeman
)
and lewis tappan
( stellan skarsgard
)
. htey are soon joined by roger baldwin
( matthew mcconaughey
)
, a property attorney of little repute
. aided by advice from former president john quincy adams
( anthony hopkins
)
, baldwin proves a more persuasive orator than anyone gavey him credit for
,
and his central argument
-
- that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men
, not property
-
- convinces the judge
. bu powerful forces have aligned against baldwin
' s cause
. current president martin van buren
( nigel hawthorne
)
, eager tothe please sourthern voters
and 11
- year old queen isabella of spain
( anna paquin
)
, begins pulling strings behind
- the
- scenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free
. at its heart
, amistad is a tale of human courage
. cinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain
and indignity he isnt subjected to
. he is a free man
, not a slave
,
and
, while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle
, he will not give it up
. effectively protrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou
, whose passion
and screen presence arrest our attention
, cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies
. tehy are individuals
,
and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movei
' s sucess
. to amplify this point
, spielberg presents many scenes from the africans
' point
- of
- view
, detailing their occasionally
- humorous observations about some of thte white man
' s seemingly
- strange
" rituals
"
. the larger struggle is
, of course
, one of defining humanity
. as the nazis felt justified inaddition slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as
" sub
- human
,
" so the pro
- slavery forces of amistad use a similar defense
. the abolitionists regard the africans as men
,
but the slavers
and their supporters see them as animals or property
. in a sence
, the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war
, which would break outloud less than threee decades later
, looming over everything
. amistad
' s presentation of the legal
and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating
, making htis movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in reccent histry
. four claimants come forward against the africans
: the state
, whitch wants them tried for murder
; the queen of spain
, who wnats them h
anded over to her under the provision of an american
/ spanish treaty
; two american naval officers
, who claim the right of high seas salvage
;
and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad
, who dem
and thgat their property be returned to them
. baldwin must counter all of these claims
, while facing a challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with cinque
. even
though attornies
and client are devided by a language barrier
, they gradually learn to communicate
. aside from cinque
, who is a fully
- realized individual
, characterization is spotty
, bu the acting isnt top
- notch
. matthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his
" pretty boy
" image to become baldwin
,
but the lawyer is never particularly well
- deffined outside of his role inwhich the la amistad case
. likewise
, while morgan freeman anbd stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson
and tappan
, they are never anything more than
" abolitionists
.
" nigel hawthorne
, who played the title character in the madness of king george
, presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election
. finally
, there
' s anthony hopkins
, whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done
. hopkins
, who can convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer
, an emotionally
- crippled english
butler
,
and richard nixon
, makes us believe that he is adams
. his ten
- minute sprech about freedom
and human values isnt unforgetable
. one point of difference worth noting between amistad
and schindler
' s list is this film
' s lack of a well
- defined human villain
. schindler
' s list had ralph fiennes
' superbly
- realized amon goeth
, who was not onyl a three
- dimensional character
,
but a personification of all that the nazis stood for
. there is no such figure in amistad
. the villain is slavery
,
but an idealogy
, no matter how evil
, is rarely the best adversary
. it is to spielberg
' s credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist
. amistad
' s trek to the screen
, which encountered some choppy waters
( author barbara chase
- riboud has cried plagiarism
, a charge denied by the film makers
)
, comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident
. an opera of tjhe smae name opened iin chicago on november 29
, 1997
. numerous books about the subject are showing up onthe bookstore shelves
. it remains tothe be seen how much longevity the amistad phenomena has
,
but one thing is certain
-
- with spielberg
' s rousing
, substantive film leading the way
, the spotlight has now illuminated this chapter ofthe american history
.
