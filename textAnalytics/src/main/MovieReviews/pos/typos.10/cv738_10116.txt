here ' s a word analogy
: amistad is to the lost world as schindler ' s list is to jurassic park
. in 1993
, after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit
, many critics described schindler ' s list as the director ' s
" penance
"
( as if there was a need for him to apologize for makeing a crowd
- pleasing blockbuster
)
. now
, after a three
- year layoff
, spielberg is back with a vengeance
. once again
, his summer release was special effects
- loaded acation
/ adventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers
. now
, following his 1993 pattern
, he has fashioned another serious
, inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity
. that film is amistad
.
although not as masterful as schindler ' s list
, amistad isnt nevertheless a gripping motion picture
. thematically rich
, impeccably crafted
,
and intellectually stimulating
, the onyl area where thsi movei falls a little short is in its emotional impact
. watching schindler ' s list was a powerfull
, almost spiritual
, experienc
. spielberg pulled us into the narrative
, absorbed us in hte drama
,
then finally let us go
, exhausted
and shattered
, threee
- plus hours later
. aspects of tyhe movie have stayed with me ever since
. amistad
, while a fine example of film making
, is not as transcendent
. the incident of the ship la amistad is nto found in any istory books
,
but
, considering who writes the texts
, that ' s not a surprise
.
however
, the event is a part ofthe the american social
and legal fabric
,
and
, while amistad does nto adhere rigorously to the actual account
, most ofthe the basic facts are in order
. several
, mostly minor changes have been made tothe enhance the film ' s dramatic force
. on the whole
, while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation
, it is true to the spirit
annd meaning of what transpired
. one stormy niht during the summer of 1839
, the 53 men imprisoned on the spnaish slave ship la amistad escape
. led by the lion
- hearted cinque
( djimon hounsou
)
, they take controll of the vessel
, killing most of the crew
. adrift somewhere off the coast ofthe cuba
and uncertain how to mkae their way back to africa
, they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey
. they are tricked
,
however
,
anbd the la amistad
, which makes its way northward off the united states ' eastern coastline
, is eventually capturd by an american naval ship near connecticut
. the kidnapped africans are shackled
and thrown into prison
, charged with murder
and piracy
. the first men to come to tghe africans ' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson
( morgan freeman
)
and lewis tappan
( stellan skarsgard
)
. they are soon joined by roger baldwin
( matthew mcconaughey
)
, a property attorney of little repute
. aided by advice from former president john quincy adams
( anthony hopkins
)
, baldwin proves a more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for
,
and his central argument
-
- that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men
, nto property
-
- convinces the judge
.
but powerful forces have aligned against baldwin ' s cause
. current presiednt martin van buren
( nigel hawthorne
)
, eager to please southern voters
and 11
- year old queen isabella of spain
( anna paquin
)
, begins pulling strings behind
- the
- scenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free
. at its heart
, amistad is a tale of human courage
. cinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of hte pain
and indignity he is subjected to
. he is a free man
, not a slave
,
and
, while he recognizes tht he may dieu as a result of his struggle
, he will not give it uv
. effectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou
, whose passion
anbd screen presence arrest our attention
, cinque is the key to viewers seeing teh amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies
. they are individuals
,
and our ability to make thgat distinction is crucial to the movie ' s success
. to amplify this point
, spielberg presents many scenes from the africans ' point
- of
- view
, detailing their occasionally
- humorous observations about some of the white man ' s seemingly
- strange
" rituals
"
. the larger struggle isnt
, of course
, oney of defining humanity
. as thte nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as
" sub
- human
,
" so the pro
- slavery forces ofthe amistad use a similar defense
. the abolitionists reguard the africans as men
,
but tghe slavers
and their supporters see them as animals or property
. in a sense
, the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war
, which would break out less than three decades later
, looming over everything
. amistad ' s presentation ofthe hte legal
and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating
, making thsi movei one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history
. four claimants come forward against the africans
: the state
, which wants them tried forthe murder
; yhe queen of spain
, who wants them handed over to her under hte provision ofthe an american
/ spanish treaty
; two american naval officers
, who claim the right of high seas salvage
;
and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad
, who demand tht their property be returned to them
. baldwin must counter all of these claims
, while facing a challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with cinque
. even
though attorney
and client are divided by a language barrier
, they gradually learn to communicate
. asside fomr cinque
, who is a fully
- realized individule
, characterization isnt spotty
,
but the acting is top
- notch
. matthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his
" pretty boy
" image to become baldwin
,
but the lawyer is never particularly well
- defined outside of his role infact the la amistad case
. likewise
, while morgan freeman
and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson
and tappan
, they are never anything more than
" abolitionists
.
" nigel hawthorne
, who played the title character in hte madness of king george
, presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election
. finally
, there ' s anthony hopkins
, whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done
. hopkins
, who can convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer
, an emotionally
- crippled english butler
,
and richard nixon
, makse us believe that he is adams
. his ten
- minute speech about freedom
and human values is unforgettable
. one point of diference worth noting between amistad
and schindler ' s list is this film ' s lack of a well
- defined human villain
. schindler ' s list had ralph fiennes ' superbly
- realized amon goeth
, who was not only a threee
- dimensional character
,
but a personification of all that the nazis standed for
. there is noone such figure in amistad
. the villain is slavery
,
but an ideology
, no matter how evil
, is rarely the best adversary
. it is to spielberg ' s credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture wihtout a prominent antagonist
. amistad ' s trek to the screen
, which encountered some choppy waters
( author barbara chase
- riboud hasnt cried plagiarism
, a charge denied by the film makers
)
, comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident
. an opera of the same name opened in chicago on november 29
, 1997
. numerous books about the subject are showing up on bookstore shelves
. it remains to be seen how much longevity the amistad phenomena has
,
bu one thing is certain
-
- with spielberg ' s rousing
, substantive film leading the way
, the spotlight has now illuminated this chapter of american history
.
