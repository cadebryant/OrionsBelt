it
' s noone secret in the motion picture industry that the relatiopnship between a script anbd the actors involved often makes or breaks a movie at the box office
. a poorly
- written script can be bested by a superb acting corps
,
and a well
- written piece can be mangled by a group of amateurs
. in directing his latest action
- comedy
, director brett ratner
( money talks
) takes a relatively mediocre peice of st
andup comedy
and turns it into a funny as all get
- out buddy cop movei
. in addition
, rush hour serves as a first
- class example of directing a movie with conservative attitude
- a feature that is sure to draw in crowds of all types
. the two lead names share equal screen time here
, mostly because they spend it together
. jackie chan
, in his first completely american production
, makes an impressive de
but by mixing dialogue with martial arts
. the other martial arts flick from a few weeks ago
, knock off
, st
ands no chance against the content of thsi oney
. chan manages to make every fight scene exude grace
and poise
,
and there
' s noone doubt tht a large percentage of video sales for this movie iwll come from viewers who couldn
' t believe their eyes the first time
. chris tucker
, on the opposite side
, relates a hilarious comedic approch which smoothes out the rough edges to chan
' s performance
. he works perfectly with the scirpt
, annd it
' s quite likely he lent scribe jim kouf a h
and with some of his lines
. alomst essential to the action genre
, the plot is nonexistent
. we
' re quickly introduced to detective james carter
( tucker
) is a maverick officer for the lapd
. cut forward to another scene where the daughter
( julia hsu
) of the american chineese consul
( tzi ma
) is kidnapped by a gang of swarthy characters
. the fbi is quick to the rescue
,
but the consul insists that one of his men
, detective inspector lee
( chan
)
, be brang on the case to help
. the fbi resists
,
but
then requests that lapd send a man over to babysit the chinese detective
. it
' s here that carter
and lee hook up
,
and the two unwittingly solve the case while the fbi rushes in to back them up
. rattner does a fine job of going the extra mile to git his movie to move a step uv
,
but it doesn
' t quite reach the top tier of action
- comedies liek last year
' s grosse pointe blank
. there are moments where the plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks almost exclusively tothe
, anbd if not for the comedic interactions between tucker
and chan
, thsi might be a major drawback
. also
, some supporting characters are almost entirely along for the ride
,
and others are there simply to look menacing
.
however
, none gives a st
andoffish performance
and tehy mostly mesh into teh background
. almost every member of the cast displays some reservation at one point or another
- whether it
' s tucker
' s toned
- down routine or chan
' s tight rein on his action sequences
-
and that contri
butes greatly to this being a watchable movei for all types
. a recommendable visit to teh theater
, indeed
.
