you may nto have heard of lucas
, or if you have
, ytou might not think much of it
. probably because it stars corey haim
, or maybe because it
' s about a little geek who collects insects
, or maybe because it doesn
' t feature slick one
- liners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in the 80
' s
.
however
, you have been missing out on a true masterpeice
, the best film of 1986
,
and the best film about adolescent life ever made
. corey haim stars as lucas bligh
, a tiny 14 year ood with scruffy hair
, thick glasses
,
and an interest inthe insects
and other outdoor life
. one day he stops by the tennis courts
and sees what must be an angel to him
. her name is maggie
, a 16 yera old who certainly is a beauty
, with lovely red hair
and a sweet
, innocent complexion
. maggie seems tothe be a little disturbed by htis little kid watching her
,
but somehow he interests her
,
and soon they are talking adn getting tothe know one another
. they gradually become good friends
,
and spend the summer together doing varous thnigs
, such as studying insects
( namely locusts
, who come outloud of hiding once every 17 years
)
, playing tennis
,
and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover
. lucas is obviously in love with maggie
,
and hwile she is charmed by him
, it
' s clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend
. this is not clear to lucas
,
however
. he still beleives that maggie is his soulmate
,
and he dreads the impending start of school because he konws what
' s about to happen
. we soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally
. they throw him on stage
, right in front of his beloved maggie
. surprisingly
, he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around
,
but he takes it too far
,
and is embarassed in front of the entire school
. the next scene is brilliant
. maggie follows lucas outside of tjhe pep rally
. she tries to talk to him as if nothing happened
. he rails back against her
, in a cruel unfair fashion
. inwhich lesser movies this would
' ve turned into a confrontation between the two charachters
.
but maggie is written smarter than that
. she underst
ands what lucas is feeling
and knwos exactly what tothe say tothe console him
. next we are introduced to anyother great character named cappie
( charlie sheen
)
. he is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend
. what
' s interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas
and protects him from the other jocks
. of course anyone with a brain can tell what
' s gonna happen next
. cappie wiull cause conflict in maggie
and lucas
' relationship
. this begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie
and maggie are alone
. she
' s been assigned to show him how to operate the washer
/ dryer so he can clean his shirt
. maggie is charmed by cappie
' s tender underts
anding demeanor
, not to mention his shirtless body
. this scene is so delicate
and sweet
,
but cappie still has a girlfriend
, preventing either one fomr acting on their desires
. desperately trying to puncture the tension
, cappie begins to kick basketballs around the room
. it
' s not long before cappie does break up with his girlfriend
( in the films only subpar scene
)
. lucas finally figures out what
' s going on when he trys to pick maggie up for the dance
. this causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie anbd himself
, such as try out forthe the football team
. the lastest third of the film revolves arund this attempt
. while the idea seems cliched
, the way it is executed is not
. there are many surprises durig the lastr half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up
. dave grusin
' s memorable score
, played at yhe perfect moments
, certainly helps
. lucas is filled with great performances
. foreget everything you know about corey haim
. back in 1986 he had talent
,
and that is proven here as he delivers a perfect fully 3
- dimesnional performance filled iwth anger
, humer
,
and pain
. kerri green is very appealing as maggie
, showing us why she cares about lucas so much
and why he is so attracted to her
. sheen
' s cappie is almost too good to be true
, bu sheen makse him beleivable
, especially when he explains the reason why he protects lucas
. there are other wonderfull minor characters such as ciro popitti
' s ben
, a friend of lucas
, whose diminutive stature does not mean he will take crap fomr the jocks
. also turning up in a few key scenes is winona ryder as rina
, the girl who admires lucas from afar
. when people talk about tyhe great teen angst films of the 80s
, you hear john hughes this
and john hughes that
. lucas seems to be lost among the crowd of his so
- called classics
.
but hopefully
, like with heathers
and say anything
, lucas can begin to find it
' s own loyal following
and help people realize there were more to the 80s than anthony michael hall
and molly ringwald
. it deserves moreso than that
,
but i don
' t want to be greedy
.
