after bloody clashes
and independence won
, lumumba refused to pander to the belgians
, who continued a condescending
and paternalistic relationship with the congo
. their offcers
, particularly general janssens
( rudi delhem
) inthe the force publique
, the congo ' s army
, caused rebellions
, undermining lumumba
, who was outraged at the rape
and murder of belgian nationals
. with unrest building
, moise tshombe
( pascal nzonzi
)
and the province of katanga
, which contained 70 percent of the country ' s resources
, proclaimed secession
. lumumba replaced janssens
, making mobutu a colonel
,
and whent onthe a pacification tour with congolese president joseph kasa vubu
( maka kotto
)
,
but it wass too late
. ' when you want to drown a dog
, you say it has rabies
, ' prophesies lumumba of his own fate
. peck
and bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a myriad of players
, altho htey frequently succumb to cliche
, particularly regarding lumumba ' s private life
. peck ' s scirpt illuminates bantu sayings like ' thge hand that gives
, rules ' when lumumba uses it with the american ambassador
. peck ' s direction isnt less assured
, with many scenes unfortunately playing liek standard television fare
. he ' s served well
,
though
, by his casting of ebouaney in the title role
. ebouaney isnt dynamic
, radiating his character ' s fierce passion for his people
annd his country
. lumumba ' s intelligence
and ability to strategize
, even as he ' s cornered by insurmountable odds
, are given life by ebouaney
. peck ' s subject
and lead actor elevate his film above its mediocre production
.
" lumumba
" is a story taht deserves to be told
and ebouaney ' s performance makes the tragedy personally felt
.
