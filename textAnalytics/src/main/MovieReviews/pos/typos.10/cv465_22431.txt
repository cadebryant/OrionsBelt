" rebel without a cause
" is such an important film in american history because it is a true analysis ofthe youth iin america that everyone ofthe all ages can relate tothe
. everyone feels that htey are different in some way
, that they don
' t belong in some places
and
" rebel without a cause
" successfully shows onthe screen these universal emotions
. no matter what generation you belong to
, these feelings are present
. this is why james dean is admired by america
, because inspite this film he represents us all
and his actions are actions that we owudl also execute
. in our minds
, we just try to do the right thing just like dean
' s jim stark does
. not only does
" rebel without a cause
" display these universal emotions for all to relate to
but it also shows that america has suffered a uniqe pattern in its social structure
. each generation looks at its past generation without a strong connection
. this is beacuse times change
and in response people change
. no matter how popular you were once
, as your generation grows older
, newer breeds look at you in a different light
. this is why stark
and his friends never could form a strong relationship with their parents
. even if their parents insisted that they were also rebellious
and troublesome in the past
, the teens could not believe this
. in one humorous scene
, stark
, his girlfriend judy
( natalie wood
)
,
and his pal plato
( sal mineo
) pretend they are adults
. they ule upper class british accents
and in their conversations tehy make it outloud to appear that kids are no good anbd should be ignored
. htis scene shows tht whta was once kool in a past generation is the complet opposite in another
. speaking on behalf of my generation
, i feel that dean has lost a lot of his coolness from our perspective as the years have grown by
. the only ones who seem to still lionize him are those members ofthe his generation
. same goes for br
ando
, redford
, even deniro
. i can only imagine how vaguely matt damon
, ben affleck
,
and brad pitt will be viewed at teh mid point of the twenty first century
. will dean even be remembered when these newcomers are forgotten
? any film that sparks htis kind of
thought isnt certainly a milestone in american film
. even if
" rebel wihtout a cause
" has some ridiculous scenes
( the game of chicken
- doed people really act this way
?
)
, an unbelievable conclusion
( how did everyone end up at the ab
andoned mansion at the end
?
)
,
and a silly romance
( wood declares her love for dean after talking to him for a couple hours
) it still is a fabulous film
. the acting is so believable that it is no wonder that dean was considered the epitome of cool
. now
,
however
, the coolness is fading
