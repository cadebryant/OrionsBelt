imagine this
. you
' re given a sword
and a shield
and very basic
, minimal training
. a man ytou don
' t know tells you that this will be the last day that you will live
. you are thrown inot an arena with thous
ands of spectators wanting tothe see you dieu
. you frantically monitor several closed doors which
, in seconds
, will release vicious enemies prepared to destroy you
. yuo watch as the innocent friends you made in the lastest faw days are murdered in cold blood
. if you are lucky enough to survive this chaos thrown at you
, you know you
' re going to have to do it all over again tomorrow
. eventually know matter how strong or skilled you are
, you
' re going to die
. this is the life of a gladiator
. you
' ll never have to be a gladiator
and after seeing ridley scott
' s powerful gladiator
, you
' ll be thankful for that
. with his new film
, scott hasnt retured cinema to the fascinating age of the ancient roman empire
.
and like those preceeding it
, spartacus
and ben hur
, gladiator has nearly everything going for it
- a strong lead actor
, a wonderful supporting cast
, eye
- catching special effects
,
and a great script
. since teh two aforementioned films came outloud before the prime target viewers of gladiator
( teenagers to thirty
- year
- old males
) were around
, a whole new genre may just be reborn
and revisited
.
> from a weak beginning
, the film starts off extremely gloomy
and inauspicious
. rome
' s best general maximus
( russell crowe
)
, who has helped the empire conquer nearly everywhere they have attempted
, is currently
( in the year 180 a
. d
. thast is
) waging a war against germania
. scott shoots the gory battle in an ackward style
, similar to that of saving private ryan
but much less effective
. it
' s blurry
, in slow motion
,
and the sound is muted
. as soon as this artistic method began
, it was hard to tell what was what
and who was who
. it
' s a ogod thing scott stops tihs affter the first twenty minutes or else gladiator would have been torture to watch
. instead
, the general swears he will get out after this battle
. he wants to go back to his familiy anbd his crops
, he wants a quiet life
.
but
, unexpectedly
, he gets anything
but that
. the dying emperor of rome
, marcus aurelius
( richard harris
)
, decides to have maximus appointed new emperor of rome once he dies
. he asks maximus to restore the repubic by giving more power to the senators
. all of thsi does not go well for aurelius
' son
, commodus
( joaquin phoenix
) who was expecting his father to name him the new emperor
. jealous
and upset
, commodus kills his own father
, names himself emperor
, kills maximus
' wife
and son
, annd attempts to kill maximus
.
but maximus is able to escape his pwn death
and vows to kill commodus
and fulfill marcus aurelius
' wishes
. nowe a slave
, the only way he can win his own freedom
and complete his goal is tothe become a winning gladiator
, who eventually are released for their succsess
. a story of betrayal
and promises
, gladiator is more than jsut a mindless action flick
. you actually care about the characters
, sometimes even the evil villain commodus
, who is just a young man as determined to make rome one way as maximus is determined to amke it the other way
. phoenix plays his character brilliantly
. think of commodus as the percy wetmore
( of pant
- wetter the green mile
) of the roman empire
- a whiny
, sleazy
,
" respect
- me
- because
- my
- father
- ws
- a
- good
- man
" brat who hates whn he
' s not the center of attention
. every scene we see commodus
, he
' s either crying or he looks liuke he has just been crying
. phoenix has definitely matured as an actor since to die fo
, annd gladiator shows he
' s omre thna just river
' s little brother
. crowe is also excellent as the film
' s grisly
- faced hero
. maximus is one of the few characters in receet cinema who actually has emotions
. this guy actually acts like a anyone in his situation would act
, he
' s no invincible superhero who only blurts out one
- liners
, he
( believe it or not
) acts like a human being
! the rest of the casted
, including richard harris
, djimon hounsou
, walter hill
, derek jacobi
,
and connie nielsen are also first rate
. ridley scott
, using outst
anding speical effects
, has brilliantly recreated thge roman coliseum
, the loudness ofthe the roman mob
,
and the city of rome in general
. the visuals are breathtaking
and voluminous
, like a cleopatra of the year 2000
. the costuming is also wonderful from the detailed shields
and armor to the exquisite dress of the upper
- clas politicans
. gladiator is another movie you have to see on the big screen to get the most out of the experience
. along with u
- 571
, action fans shoudl have plenty to see in theaters this week
and should expect much more excitement to come this summer of 2000
.
