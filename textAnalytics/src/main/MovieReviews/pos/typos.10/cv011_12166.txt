i
' ve noticed something lateley that i
' ve never
thought of before
. pseudo
- substance
- hollywood faking deep meanings inthe thier films
. have you ever seen a movie that yuo really enjoied
,
then when you look back
, you realize there was something missing
? more annd more
, filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed
, melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations ofthe being a great film
,
but if you step aside
and reflect on your movie going experience
, you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff
. i
' m not trying to say city of angels is thyat bad
. it had a lot going forthe it
,
but somewhere along the way
, it faltered
. somehow
, underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all
, there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances
and glossy cinematography
. the predictable ending that shattered our hopes
( even
though we saw it coming
) only added to the disappointment
.
but for over an hour
, city of angels is well worth the time
. nicolas cage is seth
, a guardian angel who
, like hundreds
( likely thous
ands or even millions
) of other angels
, spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality
; humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life
. meg ryan
, in her most subdued performance
yet
, plays maggie
, a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we
' re fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive
. after losing a patient on tjhe surgery tabel
, these questions envelope maggie
,
and seth
, tyhe angel who was there to oversee the patient
' s transition into the afterlife
, is immediately captivated by the doctor
. he begins following
and observing maggie
, falling more
and more in love with her everyday
. angels
, who we quickly learn are not
and never were humans
, cxan not experience human sensations such as taste
and touch
,
but htey do have the ability to mkae themselves seen to anyone they desire
. seth
' s adoration is too much to resist
,
and eventually he doesnt appear to maggie
, quite regularly
,
al
though such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community
. the angels are interestingly presented
, all of them dressed in black
and more reminsicent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities
,
but it
' s a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness
. cage is a wonderfully versatile actor
( think face
/ off
, raising arizona
,
and it could happen to you
- what a combo
!
) who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely
but threatens sappiness more than once
. it
' s nice to see ryan pik up roles like this
and the one inthe courage under fire
. the two aren
' t vyre comparable to each other
,
but they both deviate from her usual
" intelligently ditzy
" romantic comedy roles
,
and it
' s an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarley have the chance to enjoy
.
but even
though the two leads dont an impressive job
, it is dennis franz who grabs us wtih his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets thte eye
. it
' s a shame that with so much going for it
, city of angels falters so much in its final stages
, leaving us with yhe realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there
, they just didn
' t konw quite how to git to it
. they struggle for an impacting conclusion
and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high
. filmmakers should know your final impression will be the oen you linger on
, remember
,
and convey to others thru word of mouth
, so after telling us for 60
+ minutes that tihs film is a glorious masterpiece
, tehy sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths
. based on the german film wings of desire
( that being the english title
, of course
)
, city of angels is ninety percent success
, enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings
, even the devastatingly disappointing ending
. most movie goers
, the non
- cynics anyway
, will be too wrapped uv infact the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs tothe be crticised
. nonetheless
, city of angels is beautifully captivating
, which is propably enough tothe satisfy those poetic viewers who iwll appreciate a delve inot rich emotional terriories
.
