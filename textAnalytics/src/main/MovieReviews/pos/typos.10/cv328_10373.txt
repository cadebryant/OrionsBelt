do film critics have morals
? are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow
? naturally we don
' t want to go into a film with any preconceived notions
, which is pretty tough
but something we all have to accomplish
. secondly
,
and along the same line
, we can
' t prejudge a film because of it
' s stars
, director
, etc
. the difference
? well
, in the first oen
, we
' d go into a film thingking it
' s going to be dumb or it
' s going to be good
, anbd that would affect our viewing
( that movie sounds
and looks dumb
, so i
' m not expecting much
)
. on the second h
and
, we
' re simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal
" grudge
" aganist the film company
( it
' s made by disney
? oh
, it
' s just a merch
andising ploy
then
)
, the actors
( jim carrey
' s in it
? it
' s gonna stink
!
)
, or the director
( who
? can
' t be that good
)
. htis isnt more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint
. make sence
? ok
,
but what about comparing
? isn
' t that kind ofthe along the same lines
? wehn we compare a certain actor or director or even composer
' s credibility in one film tothe another they were involved in
, is taht realy fair
? sure
, in sequels you can expect
and accept comparisons a lot more
,
but what about jackie brown
, forthe example
? is it fair for me to take the review
and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction
, jsut because quentin tarantino directed
and wrote the screenplay for both
? i think it is
,
and i
' ll tell you why
. a ogod critic should be able to view the film ffrom the
" average joe
( or jane
)
" viewpoint
, while still taking into account the artistic intergrity behind the film
. sometimes taht can be tough
.
" the acting was superb
, bu i was bored
" or
" i loved it
!
! it wass sooooo cheezy
!
" might be used to describe a film
. these are contradictions
,
and a critic has to weigh both sides
and come to a suitable balanced critique
.
but which is more important
?
and which is better
? an extremely well shot
and acted film that isnt boring
, or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back tothe again
and again
? getting back to the point
, my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we
' re reflecting what the public wants to knwo anyway
. every averege person outloud there who
' s intersted in this film is likely to ask
" how does it compare to pulp fiction
?
"
and so
, as a critic
, i
' m already responsible to ask tht same question
. jackie brown stars pam grier
, the
" blaxploitation
" heroine from the 1970
' s
, who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character
. tarantino
' s pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta
' s sudden revival in the movie industry
,
and wtih talks of an oscar nomination
, the same is likely to happen for grier
.
( we
' ve made it thru comparision
# 1
!
) jackie is a 44
- eyar
- old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash
,
and probably her main revenue
, by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie
( pulp fiction
' s samuel l
. jackson anbd comparison

)
. ordell is in the illegal firearms bussines
and has enlisted the aid ofthe louis gara
( robert de niro
)
, a bank robber who jsut got out of prison after serving four years
, to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half
- million dollars
. trouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet
( michael keaton
)
and taken into custody for possession of narcotics
, as well as having more monay than is allowed infact an airport without being claimed
. naturally this proves an obstacle to ordell
' s plans adn
, not as friendly intended as we
' d hope
, he posts jackie
' s bail after she is put behind bars
. the thing is
, ordell is in this for no one more than himself
,
and as we learn fomr his previous actions
, he
' s willing tothe kill anyone who st
ands in hte way
. jackie finds herself infront a tight squeeze
. ordell won
' t think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she
' s always done
,
yet at the same time
, a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell ws provided
. it comes down to a simple question
: would jackie rather face ordell or prison
? whta ensues is a rich
and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help
: tjhe law
, ordell
, or maybe just herself
. coming into play isnt anohter 70
' s veteren
, robert forster as jackie
' s bail bondsmen max cherry
. max
' s obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight tothe beat both sides of the system
,
and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance
. also involved is ordell
' s
" surfer girl
" girlfriend melanie
( bridget fonda
)
, a ditzy sun
- bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in h
and
. fonda does the best she cant with an essentially thin role
, bu there
' s nothing more to her
,
and therefore
, she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters
. de niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a fewd bucks for himself
. de niro is a brilliant actor
,
but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn
' t need a de niro to play him
. compared to pulp fiction
( comparison
# 3
)
, the characters in jackie brown
and vyer thin
and replaceable
. in pulp fiction
, even the small
, seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful
, complete
, anbd lifelike
, whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn
' t have suffered much with a lesser talented cast
, the exception being grier
. tarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind
, so to say that she isnt made for this role is a reversed truth
. sadly
, grier too could have received a bit more attension
, especially when the story isnt all about her newly
- jarred perception of life
. jackson teams up with tarantino agina
,
but the chemical reaction isn
' t as awesome as the first tiome
. jules was the rambling
, bible
- quoting hitman iin pulp fiction
,
and jackson is the only person who sould have pulled it off
.
and
al
though jackson is really
, really good in jackie brown
, i don
' t think he
' s quite as irreplaceable
. in fact
, maybe a newyorker face would have been better
. jackson could
' ve remained tarantino
' s jules
,
and a new guy coudl have become ordell
, forever to remain so in our memories
. sadly
, these characters are too much the same
, except ordell just isn
' t as impressive
,
and putting this in the h
ands of jackson once again is onyl going to deter from our fond recollections of jules
. anyother problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the begginning
. thsi is grier
' s film
, so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become moreso of a supporting character as the film progresses
? it not only makes the movei fiel a little too slanted
,
but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story
. it is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino
' s quirky dialogue
and eccentric directing stlye
, annd not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard
' s novel
" rum punch
"
. for those movie
- goers
, don
' t expect another pulp fiction
and you
' ll be satisfied
, for the script oozes with the familliar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of 90
' s film
- making
. the directing has toned down a bit
,
however
,
yet we
' re still reminded that this is tarantino
' s movie thanks to odd splitted
- screen story
- telling devices
and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints
. so getting back to the question that i began with
, this isn
' t pulp fiction at all
. it
' s good
,
but it isn
' t anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place
. this is a more conservative tarantino
,
but not one that won
' t satiate true fans
. if ytou can realize that this isn
' t going to knock your socks off
,
then you
' ll be happy to at least let it massage your feet
. after all
, we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy
.
