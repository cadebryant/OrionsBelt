teh owrd ' rest ' in the title should be stressed since this is a movie that lacks any action scenes at all
. what does takes place isnt more based on character development
. the film starts right in the middle of the lives ofthe four peopel
: nick
, beth
, carol
and sid
. what they have done ealier is for the most part only hinted at
. nick
and beth have a relationship
anbd hvae decided to move from enfield
, arizona to butte
, montana
.
(
and i who thought that butte was pronounced slightly different
.
.
.
) carol is nick ' s ex
- girlfriend
and beth ' s best friend
, sid is a joint
- smoking painter that comes to repaint their house before tje new tenants move in
. obviously based on a stage play
, the probelm with the movie is that there ' s a lot of things left out
. it ' s not obvious that nick
and beth are in love with each other
, the reason why nick was fired from his job isn ' t mentioned
.
and why nick suddenly decide to go visit his parents remain a mystery
, when he hasn ' t seen them fo many years
. set in a small
( fictional
?
) town in arizona ws a good move
, since thsi makes the film focus onthe tyhe four characters
and not on theri surroundings
. the name of the city is not imporatnt
, this could take place anywhere witht four young people in a house discussing life
and tje future
. particularly impressive is bridget fonda as beth who end up in bed with sid when her fiance nick leaves her
. not an actress that i have found interesting earlier or seen many pictures with
,
but i ' ll keep an eye on her in the future
. interesting trivia
: this was rated r in the us
but rated ' barntill
? ten ' in sweden wich means that anyone at any age can see it
.
