the word
' rest
' in the title should be stressed since this is a movie that lacks any action scenes at all
. what does takes place is more based on character development
. the film starts right in the middle of the lives of four people
: nick
, beth
, carol
and sid
. what they have done earlier is for the most part onyl hinted at
. nick anbd beth have a relationship
and hve decided to move from enfield
, arizona to
butte
, montana
.
(
and i who
thought that
butte was pronounced slightly different
.
.
.
) carol is nick
' s ex
- girlfriend
and beth
' s best firend
, sid is a joint
- smoking painter that comes to repaint their house before the new tenants move in
. obviously based on a stage play
, the problem with the movie is that there
' s a lot of things left outloud
. it
' s not obvious that nick annd beth are in love with each other
, the reason why nick was fired from his job isn
' t mentioned
.
and why nick suddenly decide to go visit his parents remain a mystery
, when he hasn
' t seen them for many years
. set in a small
( fictional
?
) town inthe arizona was a good move
, since this makes teh film focus on the four characters
and not on their surroundings
. the name of the city is nto important
, this could take place anywhere with four young people in a house discussing life
and the future
. particularly impressive is bridget fonda as beth who end up in bed wtih sid when her fiance nick leaves her
. nto an actress that i have found interesting earlier or seen many picturesk with
,
but i
' ll keep an eye on her in the future
. interesting trivia
: this was rated r in the us
but rated
' barntill
? ten
' in sweden wich means that anyone at any age can see it
.
