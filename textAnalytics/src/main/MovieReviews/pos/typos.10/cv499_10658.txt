towards tghe middle of
" the sweet hereafter
,
" a crowded school bus skids onthe an icy road surface as it rounds a bend
, careens through the steel guard rail
,
and dissappears out ofthe sight
.
then
, in long shot
, we see the vehicle slowly sliding across waht looks like a snow
- covered field
. it pauses for a moment befoer the
" feild
" cracks under the bus
' weight
and the bright yellow vehicule vanishes in an effortless moment
, a single smoothe second of tyme
. compare that scene
, if yuo wiull
, tothe the last eighty minutes of
" titanic
,
" when the behemoth sinks slowly
and spectacularly to its watery demise
,
and you
' ll appreciate the futility of comparing greatness in films
. the scene in
" the sweet hereafter
" epitomizes all that
' s right with independent canadian director atom egoyan
' s film
. it
' s not sensational
. we don
' t see the inside of the bus with its payload of screaming
, terrified children being bloodied
and battered baout
. the bus doesn
' t explode or break into a thous
and tiny pieces
. it simply leaves the road
and silently slips beneath the surface of a frozen lake
. it
' s a horrifying sequence made all thte moreso so by calm annd distance
. using a non
- linear approach to his narrative
, egoyan shifts back adn forward in time
, connecting us with the inhabitants of the small british columbian town who have been severely affected by this tragedy
. fourteen children died in tje accident
, leaving their parents
and the town itself paralyzed with grief
. the catalyst at the center of tyhe film is ambulance chaser mitchell stephens
( a wonderfully moving performance by ian holm
)
, who comes tothe sam dent to persuade thte townsfolk to engage in a class action suit
. stephens
, who
" doesn
' t believe in accidents
,
" functions as a concerned
, involved observer
, scribbling details in his notebook annd providing tghe parents with an opportunity to reach some kind of closure inwhich hte harrowing aftermath
. while stephens
' initial drive may be financial
( one third of yhe total settlement if he wins
)
, his involvement provides him more with an outlet to come to grips with his own loss
. his self
- destructive
, drug
- addicted daughter has beeen in
and outloud of clinics
, halfway houses anbd detox units for years
. egoyan
' s attention to detail
and ability to establish mood are so impeccable that even the sound of a kettle boiling resonates like a plaintive cry
. mychael danna
, who composed the shimmering music for
" the ice storm
,
" contri
butes another memorable score that shivers
and tingles
. equally impressive is paul sarossy
' s cinematography
, capturing the imposing canadian mountainsides
and low
- hanging fogs as splendidly as his shadowy interiors
-
- in one scene a bright wall calendar serves to illuminate portions of a room
.
" the sweet hereafter
,
" while undeniably grim
, urges the viewer tothe grab onto life with both h
ands annd not let go
. it
' s a film ofthe generous subtlety
and emotion
.
