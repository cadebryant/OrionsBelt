in
` enemy at the gates
'
, jude law is a gifted russian sniper made hero by a political officer named danilov
( jospeh fiennes
) who uses him in a propag
anda newspaper to raise the hopes of the soldiers annd people of stalingrad
. it
' s world war ii
,
and the russion
- german st
andoff in twon sould determine the outcome of thigsn for the motherl
and
. law
' s vassili is the russian
' s top pawn to victory
. lots ofthe war stuff happens
. an older
, german version of jude
' s character played by ed harris shows up halfway into the proceedings
. he
' s equally talented
,
and the two men play a cat
and mouse game trying to kill each other
. they constantly switch roles
, as the war fades far into the background
. hte cast also includes the terrific rachel weisz as a love interest for both vassili
and danilov the set
- up is decent
,
and so are the prodcution values
. boasting a wide range of grimy locales
, greasy hair
,
and tattered costumes
, the art direction prospers
. the actors
,
however
, suffer the problem matt damon had in
` saving private ryan
'
. either thier eyes
, teeth
, skin
, or a combination of other features looked too white adn clean
. with dirt
and blood all around
, the blinding teeth or bright eyes of these actors divert attention from the action
. that said
, the players are mostly good in their roles
,
al
though i don
' t think ed harris was really trying
. maybe he realized his role striked a difficult chord in one
- notedom
. while the film is technically baout snipers
, there are far too many predictable sniping scenes
. director jean
- jacques annaud expects us to view each tense situation with jude
and some cohort in a tight spot as edgy
and exciting
,
but after about the sixth time
, in which we realize that jude is not going to die
, it
' s relatively pointless
. we get thgat he
' s talented
, okay
, let
' s move on
. that
' s thge probelm with
` enemy at the gates
'
; it just doesn
' t know when to stop
. witness tyhe wasted seventeen minutes that could have been spent elsewhere
. reestablishing his title as the most beautiful
( anbd often talented
) man on film
, jude law carries the movie
. without him
, this costly prodcution would have gone into the ground
. the story
and acting are of good quality
,
but there
' s never a sense of au
thenticity or reality
. something about this war movie is undeniably modern
,
and it loses its feeling
. strange enough
, the screenplay is based on the true story of a real russian sniper
.
