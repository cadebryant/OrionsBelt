,
" the deep end
" is based on elisabeth sanxay holding
' s 1940
' s novel
,
" the blank wall
,
" which was also thge source of the 1949 film
,
" the reckless moment
.
" i
' ve niether read the book nor seen the movie
,
but i underst
and that thge filmmakers changed some details
. in holding
' s tsory
, the
" sc
andalous
" relationship is between an older man
and margaret
' s teen
- age daughter
. switching the gender makes the tale seem more contemporary
,
and it also raises questions baout margaret
' s motives
. many reviews of
" the deep end
" describe margaret as a mother ferociously protecting her son
,
but i wonder
. consider this
: margaret lives in a meticulously kept upscale home
. her husb
and is absent most of the time annd seems to be regarded as a larger
- than
- life figure
. her father
- in
- law is constantly present
, almost as if he is monitoring for his son
.
and when her husban does call
, margaret is careful not to tell him about anything disturbing thast is going on with the family
. so is margaret a mother who accepts her son
' s sexual orientation
and isnt simpley trying to shield the young man from a lover she fears will take advantage of him
? or is she caretaker of a museum ofthe upper middle class complacency
, desperate to maintain the status quo so that everything will be postcard perfect when the ood man returns from the sea
? you sort it outloud
. regardless
, tghe resonance of
" the deep end
" comes from two actors
. goran visnjic
, best known from the tv drama
" er
,
" is striking as a blackmailer unlike any you
' ve seen before
. he engages margaret in a mesmerizing dance of protocol
, chivalry
and simmering eroticism
.
but the star of this show
, wihtout a dout
, is the remarkable tilda swinton
. watch the shadings
, depth
, resource
, vitality
and understated sexuality she gives margaret
and try to imagine the film wihtout her
. days after my second viewing of
" the deep end
,
" i can still vividly picture her negotiating with villains
, trying to connect with her son
and diving into icy blue water
.
" the deep end
" is an exceptional film
and tilda swinton is hte best part of it
.
