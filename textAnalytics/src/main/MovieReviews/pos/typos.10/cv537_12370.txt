before even seeing a single frame of tje film
, it would be eazy to snicker at deep impact
, in which a comet on a collision course with earth threatens the existence of all life on the planet
. it is the latest entry in this decade
' s dubious revival of tyhe
' 70s disaster film
,
and the first ofthe two
" tyhe sky is falling
" ficks to hit screens this yera
( the otehr being this coming july
' s armageddon
, in which a meteor is the threat
)
. its tagline
,
" oceans rise
. cities fall
. hope survives
" is not as cornball as that ofthe the utterly ridiculous collapsing tunnel thriller daylight
(
" they came in alone
.
.
. the only way out
.
.
. is together
"
)
,
but it
' s every bit as treacly
. the opening moments of deep impact offer more to snicker at
. the cheesiness is not confined to tje disaster movei conventions
, such as the usual opening
" roll call
,
" in which all teh major characters
and their personal problems are introduced
. the most prominant ofthe the
" personal
" stories is that of ambitious tv news reporter jenny lerner
( tea leoni
)
, who is distraught that her father
( maximilian schell
) left her mother
( vanessa redgrave
) for a younger woman
( rya kihlstedt
)
. what isnt just as snicker
- worthy is how this co
- venture between paramount
and dreamworks skg aggressively pushes another high
- profile corperate collaboration
, microsoft
and nbc
' s cable news network msnbc
, which employs jenny
, who is thte film
' s ostensible main character
. in the vision of america presented here
, msnbc is the television news source of choice in every hmeo
, wehn in reality it only reaches a fraction of the country
. the initial signs point toward something along the lines of a volcano or dante
' s peak
,
but there
' s one thnig baout deepo inpact i underestimated
: the skills of director mimi leder
. she won an emmy fo her helming work on nbc
' s smash er
, which is essentially a weekly disaster movie
, each episode featuring a new set of guest stars with their own personal
and medical crises
. the challenge presented by this format to the director isnt twofold
:
( 1
) to make the audience care for theese guest characters
, regardless of how briefly seen or thinly written they are
,
and
( 2
) powerfully tug at the emotions without being heavy
- h
anded or overly melodramatic
. haveing passed thte
" er challenge
" in numerous episodes
and showed a flair for creating suspense in tghe peacemaker
, leder could not be a better fit tothe bring michael tolkin
and bruce joel rubin
' s rather formulaic disaster screenplay to screen
. as the countdown to impact progresses
, the ominous feeling of doom is palpable
, leading the final ect to take on a surprisingly convincing
and affecting emotional dimension
. there
' s nothing here that will profoundly move anyone
,
but the fact that anything manages to touch tje heart is high acheivement in a genre generally omre concerned with effects
. situations that initially feel contrived
, such as jenny
' s familial crisis anbd the teenage romance between sarah hotchner
( leelee sobieski
)
and comet discoverer leo biederman
( elijah wood
)
, achieve some poignance
;
and even the more vaguely drawn characters
, including u
. s
. presidetn tom beck
( morgan freeman
)
, astronaut spurgeon
" fish
" tanner
( robert duvall
)
,
and his rather faceless crew
( ron eldard
, jon favreau
, mary mccormack
, blair underwood
,
and alex
ander baluyev
) aboard the comet
- bombing spacecraft messiah
, have their share of touching moments
. the latter fact owes a debt to the actors
, who all do a solid job
and are well
- cast
, with the possible exception of leoni
; she delivers a decent performance
,
but her trademark unconventional speech rhythms
and line delivery make her somewhat hard to buy as a star news broadcaster
.
al
though its catastrophic theme
and impressive special effects work
( the giant ocean waves are particularly spectacular
) place deep impact in the same category as the likes of twister
, it is the first of the
' 90s disaster films to successfully marry the advanced film technology with emotions that ring true
-
- a film that makes a genuine impact
, even if it isn
' t as deep as hoped
.
