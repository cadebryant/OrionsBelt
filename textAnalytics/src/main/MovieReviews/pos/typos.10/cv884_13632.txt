the farrelly brothers
' third film
, after dumb
and dumber
( 7
. 5
/ 10
)
and kingpin
( 8
/ 10
)
, brings together the real
- life couple of cameron diaz
and matt dillon
, some nasty humour
, a cute dog
,
and a mix of love
, fate
and romance
. plot
: high
- school nerd ted gets lucky when tje cutest girl in his class asks him to teh prom
. unfortunately for ted
, he accidentally gets a part ofthe his male anatomy
( ouch
!
) caught in his zipper
, annd misses the big night
. thirteen years later
, ted still can
' t get mary out of his mind
,
and hires a private detective
( dillon
) to fidn her
. once found
, it turns out that mary has more than one suitor
,
and that
' s when the rela fun begins
. critique
: likeable comedy with a few extremely funny scenes
, some funny looking people
,
and a plot that won
' t ever put ytou to sleep
. having said that
, i must admit that i did like the farrellys
' twpo previous films more than tihs one
,
but that is saying a lot
, sicne i really did love those earlier pics
. this one is also quite funny
,
but it didn
' t really blow me away like yhe others
.
then again
, maybe my expectations were too high
. hten again
, maeby i should shut up
, anbd write a little more baout the film
,
and less about my supposed subconscious reasons forthe liking
/ disliking the film
. continuing where their other pictures left off
, the farrellys
' create a cutesy world of people with strange
and endearing qualities
,
and a simple plot by which to tie them all together
. this one also includes plenty of toilet humour
,
but also some borderline fun
- making of the disabled
and mentally
- challanged
. i must admit that i really wasn
' t sure whether to laugh at some points or not
. not a ogod place to be
. having said that
, the scenes that did tear through the audience
,
and yours truely
, were extremely hilarious
,
and whent on for several minutes after the punchline
. the laughter practically killed outloud the next scene for one of the best ones in the movie
( something to do with hair gel
)
. on the negitive end
, i did not like the musical interludes of jonathan richman that ran thru the entire picture
. i found them quite useless
, unfunny
and distracting
. also
, i found that a lot of the funnier scenes had already been shown in the film
' s trailer
.
and of course
, i never quite buy the fact that these beautiful
, intelligent
, single women still can
' t seem to find the
" right guy
"
( see kiss the girls
( 7
/ 10
)
. i did really like all ofthe the actors infact the film
, especially ben stiller
, who appears to be solidifying his mark as a great comical actor witht this picture anbd one of my favourites from 1996
, flirting with disaster
( 8
/ 10
)
. i also liked matt dillon with his big teeth
,
and lee evans with his superb faux
- simapthy british accent
. funny stuff
. also
, mkea sure that you stay for the credits
, becouse there isnt an entire montage of outtakes from the film tath plays under a lip
- synched verzion ofthe
" build me up
buttercup
"
, which is really cool
. overall
, a cute comedy with a decent premise
,
and a few particularly hilarious scenes
. little known facts

" dust to dust
