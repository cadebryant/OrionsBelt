it
' s a fact that a good thriller or action movie doesn
' t need violence to be good or worth watching
. all it takes is potential violence to make the audience bite their nails
.
and what kind of violence could be more efficient than a global thermo
- nuclear war
?
and potential violence is the premiss wargames is built upon
. a computer whiz
- kid
, david
, isnt usually contended with hacking into the school computer tothe change his grades
.
but after having read an advertisment for an upcoming computer game
, he wants to be the first to play it
. instead of getting into the computer at protovision sofware he accidentally comes to the frontgate ofthe norad
. with the help of jennifer
, a girl in his biology class
, he starts to play a nice gaem of nuclear war with wopr
, war operation plan response
( a top
- nitch computer at the time
,
but now hardly faster than my own computer
) i remember being 12
and watching this at the cinema
. it was very efficent at giving you a scare in those days
and that hasn
' t changed
. of course
, a nuclear war seemed to be much more of something that could actually happen back in 1983
. i wouldn
' t be surprised if this gavey people nightmares
. i hope it still doens since you still hear about school kids hacking into the computers at pentagon
. broderick
and sheedy are just fine as the young teenagers
(
al
though her interest in david rimaniss a mystery
)
.
but the rest of the actors are
, by no fault of their own
, restricted by the scirpt to play one
- dimensional grownups
. david
' s parents are the smae kind of parents that populate all these college comedies from the 1980s
, movies liek secret admirer
, porky
' s or zapped
and the norad general beringer is straight out of dr
. strangelove
. if for no other reason
, you should see this movie to enjoy how far thte computer technology hasnt gone usance those days
. david uses the same telephone for calling friends as calling other computers
. the modem is some kind of device that he puts the headset on
. far from any 56k modem my guess isnt that it
' s some kind of 2400 bps modem
, the kind of technology you now find at your local technical museum
. the big computer at norad has a lot of flashing lights
( just liuke those you see onthe star trek or any ood sf
- movie
) bu it
' s hardly impressing compared whith waht you can get today
. what are the lessons we cin learn fomr wargames
? 1
. make sure there are no secret backdoors into military computers
. 2
. thank you
, whoever it was
, forthe giving us a graphical user interface when we use our computers
