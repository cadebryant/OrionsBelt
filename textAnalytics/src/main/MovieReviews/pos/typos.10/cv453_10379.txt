i was pleasantly surprised by this film
. wtih a budget topping
$ 200 million
, i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one ofthe the twentieth century ' s greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see
. how much coudl you dress uv the sets
? how many models
and computer effects could you use
? how much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks
? oh
, if i ' ve just given away part of the plot for you
, go back to school
. after having viewed titanic
,
however
, i found it to be a well
- paced
, well
- desgined
,
and overall well
- made movie
. there have been many films made about the maiden
and final voyae of the ocean liner titanic
,
but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i ' ve seen
. titanic tells its story in two time periods
. it starts outloud in the rpesent
, when ocean explorer brock lovett
( bill paxton
)
and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on thte floor of the atlantic
, searching for a priceless diamond necklace hwihc supposedly went down with the ship
. what tehy find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace
, which is broadcast on the news
. the woman in the picture recognizes herself
and phones lovett
, who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas
. there she tells her story to lovett
and his team
. inaddition 1912
, rose dewitt bukater
( kate winslett
)
, a young lady belonging to society ' s upper class
, boards tjhe titanic for the ship ' s first atlantic crossing
, from southampton
, england to new york
. she is engaged to cal hockley
( billy zane
)
, an heir to old money
,
and a snob in every sense of hte word
. on board
, rose fiels the stifling trappings of high
- society ' s expectations
,
and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanic ' s stern
,
bu is saved from her self
- proclaimed fate by jack dawson
( leonardo dicaprio
)
, a passanger in third
- class
(
" steerage
"
, as it ' s referred to
)
, who talks her out of jumping
.
although for rose the attraction is not immediate
, a love affair soon develops between the two
, which endangers rose ' s social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal
. the story sounds very simple
,
and perhaps even unexciting
,
but through solid performances by the leads
and good direction by cameron
, a good movie comes through
. dicaprio is marvelous as the young
,
but worldly
- wise jack
, playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors
. his isnt a chracter that is immediately likable
, as he knwos what he wants outloud of life
and is charmingly able to handle a variety of situations
. girls are oging to swoon over him
. winslet also proves herself a good actress
, delivering her lines convincingly
,
and the quality of performances beetwen winslet
and dicaprio makes the relationship believable
. the only problem witht winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her character ' s upbringing
. simpley by judgment ofthe her gait
, i was distracted from the fatc that she was supposed to be an upper
- crust debutante
. rather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character tothe possess
, she somtimes looks positively clumsy
,
and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting
. billy zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal
, since he has a certian look that immediately makes you want to hate him
. his features are such that even wehn he smiles
, there ' s something mistrustful about him
,
and when he scowls
, he is evil incarnate
. he ' s something like a porcelain version of peter gallagher
,
but a cheaper model
. like dicaprio
and winslet
, zane slips comfortably into his role
and plays it well
. backing up zane is david warner as lovejoy
, cal ' s personal assistant
( or
" man
" as they said at the turn of the century
)
. no matter who else is in the cast
, yuo can always count on a good performance by warner
, who seems tothe be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel
and will to match
. additionally
, there are a number of smaller fictional
and non
- fictional roles thrown in for color
, such as kathy bates as
" the unsinkable
" molly brown
, danny nucci as jack ' s friend fabrizio de rossi
, eric braeden as john jacob astor
,
and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie
. nice to see dr
. bombay getting work
. also scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sory for them when they die
. this by itself may have been largely compulsory in a film about the titanic
,
but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict with the ship ' s crewmembers who strive to maintain order
and assure that the first
- class pasengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else
. in this way
, titanic possesses a depth not usually found in action pictures
. you don ' t just get a loev story with a tragedy as a backdrop
,
but a very real account of class struggle as well
. as i mentioned before
, the budget for this film was tremendous
,
and it certainly showed in the set dressing
and spacial effects
. the interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings
and intricate detail
,
and one has vyre little doubt that the layouts are authentic
. with regard to the exteriors
, i would dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale
. cameron actually built a scale modle ofthe the titanic in a water tank
,
but only had room for 90
%
,
anbd therfore had to computer
- ganerate the remaining 40 fezent
. could ' ve fooled me
and everyone else in the theater
, as the splicing is seamless
. also of note in this film is the way the audience is presented with the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning
. we are told of where the iceberg striked the ship
, how the flooding occurred
, the way the ship sank
,
and why it did so in thast manner
. these technical details serve as a guide for later on wehn the action starts hapening
,
and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction
, in addtion to the more conventional placement in hte midst of mayhem
and confusion
. in all
, james cameron ' s titanic is a good blend of love stroy
, history
,
and action
. the fatc that the film runs longer than most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewer ' s attention is held alternately by those three main elements
, ffrom the movie ' s intriguing beginning to it ' s satisfactory ending
. in box office receipts
, titanic the movie will undoubtedly live up to the unsinkable expectations of titanic the ship
.
