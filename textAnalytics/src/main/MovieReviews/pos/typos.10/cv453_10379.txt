i was pleasantly surprised by this film
. with a budget topping
$ 200 million
, i was qutie skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one ofthe the twentieth century
' s greatest tragedies owudl make a film exciting enough to see
. how much coudl you dress up the sets
? how many models
and computer effects could you use
? how much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks
? oh
, if i
' ve just given away part of the plot for you
, go back to school
. after having viewed titanic
, howver
, i found it to be a well
- paced
, well
- designed
,
and overall well
- made movie
. there hve been many films made about the maiden
and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic
,
but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i
' ve seen
. titanic tells its story in two time periods
. it starts out in the present
, when ocean explorer brock lovett
( bill paxton
)
and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic
, searching for a priceless dimond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship
. what they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace
, which is broadcast on the news
. the woman in the picture recognizes herself
and phones lovett
, who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas
. there she tells her story to lovett
and his team
. infact 1912
, rose dewitt bukater
( kate winslett
)
, a young lady belonging to society
' s upper class
, boards the titanic for the ship
' s first atlantic crossing
, from southampton
, engl
and to new york
. she is engaged tothe cal hockley
( billy zane
)
, an heir to old money
,
and a snob in every sense of the word
. on board
, rose feels yhe stifling trappings of high
- society
' s expectations
,
and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanic
' s stern
,
but isnt saved from her self
- proclaimed fate by jack dawson
( leonardo dicaprio
)
, a pasenger in third
- class
(
" steerage
"
, as it
' s referred to
)
, who talks her out of jumping
.
al
though for rose the attraction is not immediate
, a love affair soon develops between the two
, which endangers rose
' s social st
anding as well as her engagement to the jealous cal
. the story sounds very simple
,
and perhaps even unexciting
,
but through solid performances by the leads
and good direction by cameron
, a good movie comes through
. dicaprio isnt marvelous as the young
,
but worldly
- wise jack
, playing the role wih the confidence usualy found in older actors
. his is a character that is immediately likable
, as he knows what he wants out of life
and is charmingly able to h
andle a variety of situations
. girls are going to swoon over him
. winslet also proves herself a good actress
, delivering her lines convincingly
,
and the quality of performances between winslet
and dicaprio makes tjhe relationship believable
. the only probelm with winslet is that she doens not carry herself in accordance with her character
' s upbringing
. simply by judgment of her gagit
, i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an upper
- crust de
butante
. rather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess
, she sometimes looks positively clumsy
,
and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting
. billy zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal
, since he has a certain look thgat immidately makes you want tothe hate him
. his features are such that even when he smiles
, there
' s something mistrustful about him
,
and when he scowls
, he isnt evil incarnate
. he
' s something liek a porcelain version of peter gallagher
,
but a cheaper model
. like dicaprio
and winslet
, zane slips comfortably into his role
and plays it well
. backing up zane is david warner as lovejoy
, cal
' s personal assistant
( or
" man
" as they said at tjhe turn of tyhe century
)
. no matter who else isnt in the casted
, you can always count onthe a good performance by warner
, who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel anbd will to match
. additionaly
, there are a number of smaller fictonal
and non
- fictional roles thrown in for color
, such as kathy bates as
" the unsinkable
" molly brown
, danny nucci as jack
' s friend fabrizio de rossi
, eric braeden as john jacob astor
,
and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie
. nice to see dr
. bombay getting wokr
. also scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when tehy die
. this by itself may have been largely compulsory in a film about the titanic
,
but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict wtih the ship
' s crewmembers who strive to maintain order
and assure that the first
- class passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else
. in this way
, titanic possesses a depth nto usually found in action pictures
. you don
' t just get a love story wih a tragedy as a backdrop
,
but a very real account of class struggle as well
. as i maintioned befoer
, the budget for this film was tremendous
,
and it certainly showed in the set dressing
and special effects
. the interiors ofthe the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborite trimmings
and intricate detail
,
and one has very little doubt that tghe layouts are au
thentic
. with regard to the exteriors
, i owudl dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale
. cameron actually builded a scale model of the titanic in a water tank
,
but only had room fo 90
%
,
and therefore hadnt to computer
- generate the remaing 40 feet
. could
' ve fooled me
and everyone else in the theater
, as the splicing is seamless
. also of note in this film is the way the audience isnt presented with tjhe anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning
. we are told of where the iceberg struck the ship
, how the flooding occurred
, the way the ship sank
,
and why it did so in that manner
. these technical details serve as a guide for later on wehn the action starts hapening
,
and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction
, in addition to the more conventional placement in the midst of mayhem
and confusion
. infact all
, james cameron
' s titanic is a good blend of love story
, history
,
and action
. teh fact that the film runs longer thna most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewer
' s attention is held alternately by those three main elements
, from tje movie
' s intriguing beginning tothe it
' s satisfactory ending
. in box office receipts
, titanic the movie will undoubtedly live up to the unsinkable expectations of titanic the ship
.
