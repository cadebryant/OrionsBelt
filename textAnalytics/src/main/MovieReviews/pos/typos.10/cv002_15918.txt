you ' ve got mail works alot better than it deserves to
. in order to make the film a success
, all htey had to do was cast two extremely popular
anbd attractive stars
, have them share the screen for about two hours
and
then collect the profits
. noone rela acting was involved
and there is not an original or inventive bone in it ' s body
( it ' s basically a complete re
- shoot of the shop around the corner
, onyl adding a fewd modern twists
)
. essentially
, it goes against
and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking
. it ' s overly sentimental
and at times terribly mushy
, not to mention veyr manipulative
.
but oh
, how enjoyable that manipulation is
.
but htere must be something other tahn the casting
and manipulation that mkaes the movie work as well as it does
, because i absolutely hated the previous ryan
/ hanks teaming
, sleepless in seattle
. it couldn ' t have been the directing
, because both films were helmed by the same woman
. i haven ' t quite
yet figured out what i liked so much about you ' ve got mail
,
but
then again
, is that really important
? if you like something so much
, why even question it
? agina
, the storyline is as cliched as they come
. tom hanks plays joe fox
, the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain
and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley
, teh even mroe insanely likeable proprietor of a family
- run childrens ' s book shop called
, in a nice homage
, the shop around yhe corner
. fox
and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across thte block from the small bussiness
. little dont they know
, they are already in lvoe with each other over the internet
, only neither party knows yhe other person ' s true identity
. the rest of the stoy isn ' t important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars tothe share the screen
. sure
, there are some mildly interesting subplots
,
bu they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship
. all of this
, of course
, leads up to the predictable climax
.
bu as foreseeable as the ending is
, it ' s so damn cute
and well
- done that i dout any movie in the entire yera contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does
. when ryan discovers the true identity of her online love
, i was filled with such
, for lack of a better owrd
, happiness thast for the first time all year
, i actually left the theather smiling
.
