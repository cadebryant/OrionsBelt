now
, lets first look into the history of shark films
. there was the unforgettable jaws
. the exciting jaws 2
. the rather flaky jaws 3d
and sometime in the late 90s another film of tyhe same genre that i can
' t seem to recall
( baout the son of jaws returning tothe wreak revenge or something like that
)
. now
, with the magic of cgi
, one shark is simpley not enough
; in deep blue sea
, htere are 3 big
, mean adn really smart ones
! russell frankiln
( jackson
) visits aquatica
( a sea
- bound research center
)
, where a reasearch is being conducted on the extraction of a hormone substance found uniquely within tjhe shark brain that cant cure annd reverse the effects of alzheimer
' s disease
. the substance is small in quantity
and because of this
, lead researcher dr
. susan macalaester genetically alters the shark dna
and grows them twice the size with brains as big as humans
, naturally producing more ofthe the much treasured hormones
. as sure as the sun sets in the west
, a shark breaks lose
and wreaks havoc within thge facility during a hormone extraction procedure
. with the flexability offered by cgi
, the sharks get more full
- length screen time as their predecessors did in those remote
- controlled rubber suit dyas
. gone are the days ofthe people getting pulled under the water with the water turning red right after
. this time
, we get to see the entire gobbling action
, iwth floating limbs
and all
. so
- so acting
, expeced in most of your average acation film
. jackson
( fresh from his jedi master role in the phantom menace
)
, takes on the dark
- side force of a different kind
and fits well with his wise
- cracking lines
. ll cool j
' s cook role as preacher
, does for this film wqat steven seagal
' s cook could only dream to achieve in his two under siege films
. deep blue sea does not offer any of the psychological thrills that jaws has to offer
. it does
however
, prove to be a refreshing follow
- uv within the genre
, full of visual thrills
, suspense
and believe it or not
 humour
! its like jurassic park under water
. nothing too stressful
, pure entertainment
. renny harlin
, you are forgiven
( for mkaing cutthroat isl
and
)
