now
, lets first look inot the hisory of shark films
. there was yhe unforgettable jaws
. the exciting jaws 2
. the rather flaky jaws 3d
and sometime in the late 90s another film of the same genre that i can ' t seem to recall
( about the son of jaws returning tothe wreak revenge or something liek that
)
. now
, with the magic of cgi
, one shark is simply not enough
; in deep blue sea
, there are 3 big
, mean
and really smart ones
! russell frankiln
( jackson
) visits aquatica
( a sea
- bound research center
)
, where a research is being conducted on the extraction of a hormone substance found uniquely within the shark brain that can cure
and reverse the effects of alzheimer ' s desease
. the substance is small in quantity
and baceause of this
, lead researcher dr
. susan macalaester genetically alters the shark dna
and grows them twice the size with brains as big as humans
, naturally producing more of the much treasured hormones
. as sure as the sun sets in the west
, a shark breaks lose
and wreaks havoc within the facility during a hormone extraction procedure
. with the flexability offered by cgi
, the sharks get moreso full
- length screen time as their predecessors doed in those remote
- contolled rubber suit days
. gone are the days of people getting pulled under the water with the water turning red right after
. this time
, we get tothe see the entire gobbling action
, with floating limbs
and all
. so
- so acting
, expected in most of your average action film
. jackson
( fresh from his jedi master role inspite the phantom menace
)
, takes onthe the dark
- side force of a differant kind
and fits well with his wise
- cracking lines
. ll cool j ' s cook role as preacher
, does for thsi film what steven seagal ' s cook sould only dream to achieve in his twpo under siege films
. deep blue sea does not offer any of the pyschological thrills that jaws has to offer
. it does
however
, prove to be a refreshing follow
- up within the genre
, full of visual thrills
, suspense
and believe it or nto
 humour
! its like jurassic park under water
. nothing too stressful
, pure entertainment

, you are forgiven
