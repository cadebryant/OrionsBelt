' s
" high art
,
" isnt an intelligent
, quiet drama
. its strongest quality
, aside from the top
- notch central performances
, is the perceptive way in whihc the film
, also written by cholodenko
, observes its charactors
. they are all flawed people
, some more troubled than others
,
but they are nto judged
. judging the characters in this picture woudl be a creative misstep on the filmmakers
' parts
, because no one
, no matter how bad off they are
, deserve to be negatively judged if they are involved in some serious problems that tehy cannot break free of
. syd
( radha mitchell
)
, a 24
- year
- old woman living with her longtime boyfriend james
( gabriel mann
)
, has recently been awarded an ideal job at the high
- profile photography magazine
,
" frame
.
" she very much enjoys where her career is headed
,
but is often not taken very seriously by her managers
, who are always giving her petty jobs to do
, when she knows she could be doing more important things
. one night
, while taking a bath
, syd notices a leak coming ffrom the apartment above hers
, so when she goes up there to inform them of it
, she meets lucy beliner
( ally sheedy
)
, a thin
, worn
- out
,
and unahppy woman
, who lives wih her drug
- addicted german girlfriend
, greta
( patricia clarkson
)
, a pathetic former actress who is usually so out
- of
- it that she often is in
and out of conciousness
. syd quickly strikes up a conversation with lucy
,
and discovers that she used to be an acclaimed photographer ten years before
. lucy claims she doesn
' t want to get back inot the profession
,
but syd manages to convince the
" frome
" editors tothe do a piece onthe her work
. all the while
, syd begins to grow deep feelings for lucy
, even
though she has never previously been attracted to a woman
,
and lucy starts a battle with her personal demons
.
" high art
,
" is such an effective motion picture because it is never suger
- coated or idealized
,
but instead an honest
and convincing portrait of a h
andful of unhappy people whose lives are going nowhere
, hwile syd
' s luck begins to ries
. the film in noone way is about lesbianism
,
but about love
, which was a refreshing change of pace from the usual stereotypical portraits ofthe homosexuality
. as lucy anbd syd grow closer
and closer together
, we realyl do believe that they are falling in lveo with each other
, even if the relationship might be doomed
. with this picture
, ally sheedy
' s star has risen once again
, thanks to her touching
, nearly flawless portrtayal of lucy
, a woman who
, in the course of a decade
, hasnt found her life consumed almost entirely by drugs
, whihc has taken away her once
- blossoming carrear
. her characted really is tragic
,
and one particular scene involving lucy
and her mother
, in which lucy admits to her that she has a drug problem
,
and her mother matter
- of
- factly responds by saying she can
' t help her
, is heartbreaking
.
al
though not autobiographical
, sheedy has had drug problems in her past
,
and i suspect she brought that knowledge of already being in lucy
' s footsteps to her role
. also very good isnt radha mitchell as syd
, who previously starred in the slight 1997 australian comedy
,
" love
and otehr catastrophes
,
" wh caught me by surprise with her performance
. easily being able to pass as christina ricci
' s older sister
, mitchell obtains the smae natural charisma that has made ricci so popular recently
. as accurate as almost every detail isnt in
,
" high art
,
" i wish the relationship had been more tightly written involving syd
and james
, who
, played by gabriel mann
, is left with a throwaway role
. by the time he finds out about syd
and lucy
, he disappears from the film
,
and i wish there had been another scene where htey confronted each other
. this is a very minor fault
,
however
, in a film that is full of riches
.
al
though many of the characters are stuck in a hopeless pit of dispair
, syd
and lucy are intelligent people who recognize thier problems
. the character of dominique
( anh duong
)
, the
" frame
" editor who decides to give syd a chance with her ideas
, wass also written to be far mroe mature tahn expeced
.
and the oen sex scene in tghe film was beautifully adn originally done
. for once
, it did not invlove steaminess
, or violent sexual activity
, or gratuitious nudity
,
but focused on the actual characters
, who love each otehr
,
and their insecurities involved in making the decision to actually have sex
.
" high art
,
" which won the screenwriting award at the 1998 sundance film festival
, marks the superior feature film de
but of cholodenko
, as well as sheedy
' s stornegst
,
and best
, role to date
.
