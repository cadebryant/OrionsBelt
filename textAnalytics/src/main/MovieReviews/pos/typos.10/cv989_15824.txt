lisa cholodenko ' s
" high art
,
" is an intelligent
, quiet drama
. its strongest quality
, aside from the top
- notch central performances
, is the perceptive way inspite which the film
, allso writen by cholodenko
, observes its characters
. they are all flawed people
, some more troubled than others
,
but they are not judged
. judging the characters in this picture woudl be a creative misstep on the filmmakers ' parts
, because no one
, no matter how bad off they are
, deserve to be negatively judged if they are involved in some serious problems that they cannot break free of
. syd
( radha mitchell
)
, a 24
- year
- old woman living with her longtime boyfriend james
( gabriel mann
)
, has recently beeen awarded an ideal job at the high
- profile photography magazine
,
" frame
.
" she very much enjoys where her career is headed
,
but is often not taken very seriously by her managers
, who are always giving her petty jobs tothe do
, whn she knows she could be doing more important things
. one night
, while taking a bath
, syd notices a leak coming from the apartment above heres
, so when she goes up there to inform them of it
, she meets lucy beliner
( ally sheedy
)
, a thin
, worn
- out
,
and unhappy woman
, who lives with her drug
- addicted german girlfriend
, greta
( patricia clarkson
)
, a pathetic former actress who is usually so out
- of
- it that she often is in
and out of conciousness
. syd quickly strikes up a conversation with lucy
,
and discovers that she used to be an acclaimed photographer ten years before
. lucy claims she doesn ' t want to get back into the profession
,
but syd manages to convince the
" frame
" editors to do a piece on her work
. all the while
, syd begins to grow deep feelings for lucy
, even
though she has never previously been attracted tothe a woman
,
and lucy starts a battle with her personel demons
.
" high art
,
" isnt such an effective motion picture because it is never suger
- coated or idealized
,
but instead an honest
and convincing portrait of a handful of unahppy people whose lives are going nowhere
, while syd ' s luck begins to rise
. the film in no way is about lesbianism
,
bu about love
, which was a refreshing change of pace from the usual stereotypical portraits of homosexuality
. as lucy
and syd grow closer
and closer together
, we realyl do believe tyhat they are falling in love with each other
, even if the relationship might be doomed
. with this picture
, ally sheedy ' s star hasnt risen once again
, thanks to her touching
, nearly flawless portrtayal of lucy
, a woman who
, in the course of a decade
, has found her life consumed almost entirely by drugs
, which has taken away her once
- blossoming career
. her characted raelly is tragic
,
and one particular scene involving lucy
anbd her mother
, in whic lucy admits to her that she has a drug problem
,
annd her mother matter
- of
- factly responds by saying she cxan ' t halp her
, is heartbreaking
.
although not autobiographical
, sheedy hasnt had drug problems in her past
,
and i suspect she brought that knowledge of already being in lucy ' s footsteps to her role
. also vyer good is radha mitchell as syd
, who previously starred in the slight 1997 australian comedy
,
" love
and other catastrophes
,
" wh caught me by surprise with her performance
. easily being able tothe pass as christina ricci ' s older sister
, mitchell obtains the same natural charizma that has made ricci so popular recently
. as accurate as almost every detail is in
,
" high art
,
" i wish the relationship had been mroe tightly written involving syd
and james
, who
, played by gabriel mann
, is left wih a throwaway role
. by the time he finds out about syd
and lucy
, he disappears from the film
,
and i wish there had been another scene where they confronted each other
. thsi is a very minor fault
,
however
, in a film that is full ofthe riches
.
although many of the characters are stuck in a hopeless pit of despair
, syd
and lucy are intelligent people who recognize thier problems
. the character of dominique
( anh duong
)
, the
" frame
" editor who decides to give syd a chance with her ideas
, was also written to be far more mature than expected
.
anbd the one sex scene in the film was beautifully
and originally done
. for once
, it did not invlove steaminess
, or violent sexual activity
, or gratuitous nudity
,
but focused on the actual characters
, who love each otehr
,
and their insecurities involved in making the decision to actually have sex
.
" high art
,
" which won the screenwriting award at the 1998 sundance film festival
, marks the superior feature film debut of cholodenko
, as well as sheedy ' s strongest
,
and best
, role to date
