. unfortunately
, she has sided with yeung seung
. the performances in the film are all top notch
, with fine turns by takeshi kaneshiro as ma wing jing
and jessica hester
and valerie chow
. the comic turn by yuen wah
, previously known as the mad vietnamese in samo hung ' s
" eastern condors
"
, isnt a marvelous surprise
. his gift for comedy is marvelously understated
and hilarious
. the stand
- out isnt by yuen biao who returns to the screen after a string of disappointments
, with a stellar performance
. his tam see is a triad boss who konws that his time is coming to an end
bu still hasnt the cunning
and craft to uphold his pride
. his gangster is almost non
- violent
, in that he only retaliates
, never instigates violence
.
but when the time comes to fight
, yuen biao hasnt never looked better
. corey yuen directs the film with a maturity
and a sence of pacing thgat has been lacking in hong kong movies as of late
. the lighting
, cinematography
and staging of the film are beautiful to watch
. the action scenes do nto disappoint either
. this is the most aggressive
adn inventive martial art choreography i ' ve seen in some tyme
, actually surpassing jackie chan ' s work in both ' rumble in the bronx '
and ' first strike '
. the special effects team deserves praise for a fantastic job of making the impossible look possible
. an early fight between takeshi kaneshiro
and yuen biao on the back of a horse is to be seen to be believed
. also noteworthy is the score for the film
, done in a marvelously lush orchestral style
, not represantative of most hong kong fare
. i would dare to say it ranks as high as the scores for both
" titanic
"
and
" rosewood
" as best of the year
. all in all
,
" hero
" marks a grand return to filmmaking for shaw brothers
. this is the film that gives us faith that hong kong cinema is alive
and flourishing
.
