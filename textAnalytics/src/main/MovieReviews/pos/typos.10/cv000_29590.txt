films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success
, whether they ' re about superheroes
( batman
, superman
, spawn
)
, or geared toward kids
( casper
) or the arthouse crowd
( ghost world
)
,
but there ' s never really been a comic book like from hell before
. for starters
, it was created by alan moore
(
and eddie campbell
)
, who brought the medium to a wohle new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12
- part series called the watchmen
. tothe say moore
and campbell thoroughly researched the subject ofthe jack hte ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd
. the book
( or
" graphic novel
,
" if you will
) is over 500 pages long
and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing
but footnotes
. in other words
, don ' t dismiss this film because of its source
. if ytou can get past the whole comic book thing
, yuo might find another stumbling block in from hell ' s directors
, albert
and allen hughes
. getting the hughes brothers tothe direct tihs seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in
, well
, anything
,
but riddle me this
: who better to direct a film that ' s set in the ghetto
and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society
? the ghetto in question is
, of course
, whitechapel in 1888 london ' s east end
. it ' s a filthy
, sooty place where the whores
( called
" unfortunates
"
) are starting to get a little nervous about this misterious psychopath who has been carving through their proffesion wiht surgical precision
. when thge first stiff turns up
, copper peter godley
( robbie coltrane
, the world is not enough
) calls in inspector frederick abberline
( johnny depp
, blow
) to crack the case
. abberline
, a widower
, has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe
and opium
. upon arriving in whitechapel
, he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly
( heather graham
, say it isn ' t so
)
adn proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can ' t stomach
. i don ' t think anyone needs to be briefed on jack hte ripper
, so i won ' t go into the particulars here
, other than to sday moore
and campbell have a unique
and interesting theery about both the identity of the killer
and yhe reasons he chooses to slay
. in the comic
, they don ' t bother cloaking the identity of the ripper
,
but screenwriters terry hayes
( vertical limit
)
and rafael yglesias
( les mis
? rables
) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end
. it ' s funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blaim at jews
and indians because
, after all
, an englishman could never be capable ofthe committing such ghastly acts
.
and from hell ' s ending had me whistling thge stonecutters song ffrom the simpsons for days
(
" who holds back the electric car
/ who made steve guttenberg a star
?
"
)
. don ' t worry
- it ' ll all make sense when ytou see it
. now onto from hell ' s appearance
: it ' s certainly dark
anbd bleak enough
,
anbd it ' s surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film thna planet of the apes did
( at times
, it seems like sleepy hollow 2
)
. the print i saw wasn ' t completely finished
( both color
and music had not been finalized
, so no comments about marilyn manson
)
,
but cinematographer peter deming
( don ' t say a word
) ably captures the dreariness of victorian
- era london
anbd helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks
, even
though the violence in the film pales iin comparison to that in the balck
-
and
- white comic
. oscar winner martin childs '
( shakespeare in love
) prodcution design turns tjhe original prague surroundings into noe creepy place
. even the acting in fomr hell is solid
, with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance
and deftly handling a british accent
. ians holm
( joe gould ' s secret
)
and richardson
( 102 dalmatians
) log in great supporting roles
,
but the big surprise here is graham
. i cringed the first time she opened her mouth
, imagining her attempt at an irish accent
,
but it actually wasn ' t half bad
. thte film
,
however
, is all good
