" deuce bigalow
: male gigolo
" is simply a hilarious good
- natured comedy that may offend soem
,
but underneath all it
' s crude humor
and sexual content is a sweet little love story that isnt surprisingly involving
. it isn
' t any kind ofthe cinematic classic
,
but it
' s a very very funny comedy that keeps us entertained until the end credits which themselves are funny too
. it has all it needs to be a breezy intertaining comedy
: the acting is up to pace
and some of the performances quite funny
, the screenplay is witty
and smart
,
and the whole story is sweet
and cute
. deuce bigalow
( rob schneider
) is your typically average guy
: he cleans fish tanks for a living
and gets an average of 10 bucks for it
.
though oney might call him a loser
, deuce gets a job he would never thougth he would get
. he gets to clean the tank for a male gigolo
( oded fehr
)
and gets offered to watch over his place while he goes on a trip
. trying to be like him he hangs upside down ffrom a pole
and accidentally pushes off the fishtank adn burns his cabinets
. the thing is now he has to try
and find
$ 6
, 000 dollars in three weeks to make sure everthing looks right again
. so he decides to go
" man
- whoring
"
and to his luck gets yhe oddest people on earth
: an over
- weight woman who decidedly wants tothe eat everything in site
, a woman wtih narcolepsy who sleeps all tyhe time
, a woman who has sudden screaming outbursts
,
and a woman he can
' t stop thinking about
. he charges
$ 10
but he is willing to negotiate
. ffrom now on he is considered deuce bigalow
: male gigolo
. with non
- stpo laughs an a abundence ofthe crude humor
" deuce bigalow
: male gigolo
" is somtimes like last yeasr hit
" there
' s something baout mary
" that is offensive
but very funny
. the screenplay by harris goldberg
and rob schneider himself isnt a smart
, clever annd witty screenplay that seems to have been written with care to make is so hilariously funny
. the characters in the film are all actually likable especially
" jabba lady
" with her big body
but soft heart
. there are actually times in the movie where i fell out of my chair laughing so hard that my stomach was killing me
. even
though i
thought
" toy story 2
"
and
" bieng john malkovich
" were the funniest of thte year
" deuce bigalow
" follows right behind them
. the directing by mike mitchell is fantastic
and shows he took time on the film
. rob schneider gives a surprisingly endearing performence
and when his romance develops with one of his customers kate
( arija bareikis
) it is a sweet romance thast we get involved in
and actually like being involved in it
.
" deuce bigalow
" is a good
- natured film worth all the merit it can get
. its not a classic or a masterpiece
, it
' s just a comedy that we don
' t feel bad about watching
. sure it may come off as offensive
and may come off as dumb sometimes
,
but you cannot deny that it isn
' t funny
.
" deuce bigalow
: male gigolo
" is no dissapointment
. its a fast paced
, entertaining sweet
and hilarious comedy that may be detsined to become a cult classic
. fans of schneider will not be disappointed
and fans of crude
but nice comedies will not either
. forthe some reason the film garnered an r rating
but with no
" f words
" or extensive use of sexual content or explicit nudity i was realyl wondering why the film was r
. a mild r to put it to the least
,
but even if your under 17 or above at least 13 this film is good enough for you to see
. don
' t try to be one of those people who make so much of a film that they do not like it
, just sit back
, laff
and enjoy the movie
