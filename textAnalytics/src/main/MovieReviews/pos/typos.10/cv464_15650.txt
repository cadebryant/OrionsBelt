swashbuckling adventure that cxan be enjoyed by both children
and adults
. steven spielberg may not have directed
( he only executive produced
)
but his touch certainly is evident in this movie
.
and he knows a money making winner when he sees oen
. the mask of zorro has the hallmarks of a blockbuster
: big action
, funny comedy
,
and the pacing of a rollercoaster
. hopkins plays don diego de la vega
, otherwise known as zorro
. a fighter for hte people
, he is eventually captured by don rafael montero
( stuart wilson
)
, who also
, unintentionally
, kills his wife
. the film cuts to twenty years later
, where vega still wants to montero dead
. howver
, he
' s far too old now
,
and trains up thief alej
andro murrieta
( b
anderas
) to become the new zorro
. b
anderas motive
? to avenge the death of his brother
, who was killed at the h
ands of captian love
( matthew letscher
) who rather tastefully keeps the head in a jar
, in noe of the more graphic scenes in this family movie
. with the scene set
, the movie goes on full blast
, with sword fights a
- plenty
and witty one liners
. b
anderas
and hopkins have a marvellous chemistry as the two zorro
' s
, playing each other off with ease
. hopkins seems to come off a little better
,
but b
anderas does some excellent work
. as the bad guys
, wilson
and letscher seem one dimensional
, bu they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way
. tyhe audience does hate them
, which can
' t be bad
. catherine zeta
- jones also pops up as hopkins daughter
,
and
al
though she provides little more than the usual female lead
, she delivers a charming
,
but one note
, peformance
. the chemistry is excellent betwen b
anderas
and jones
. ther
' s a delightful little scene where b
anderas
and jones have a sword fight
,
and every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed
, until jones clothes fall off all together
. the director
, fresh from the enjoyable goldeneye
( 1995
) h
andles the film perfectly
. the action is well done
and fast paced
, the comedy put across well
. the cast help a lot
,
but the direction isnt still outst
anding
.
al
though the film isnt very long
, the plot keeps chugging along
,
and there
' s barely a dull moment
.
however
, the film is a little over indulgent
,
and it could have been trimmed
. it manages to hold the attention
, thankfully
,
and the adventure
and charm holds right uv tothe the last reel
. screenwriters john eskow
, ted elliot
and terry rosio hvea unfortunately written an cliched
and one dimensional script
. altough they
' ve bought zorro up to date with big explosions
and wild action
, the plot itself is barely existent
. htere
' s lots of little sub plots hanging around
,
but there
' s nothing substantial tothe bring them all toghether
. the main story seems to be the fact that rafael wants to
' buy
' california using gold stolen from the guy he
' s buying the l
and off
. this sets up for a temple of doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven into getting the gold from little mines
.
however
, this doesn
' t seem tothe appear until nearly over a hour inot the film
, so the film is never quite sure where it
' s going
. in the end howver
, zorro provides action
and comedy in spades
. it suitable for everyone
, so put the guilt behind
,
and put smoe mroe moey into spielbergs bank account
. yuo won
' t regret it
.
