' s not good to knwo too much baout someone

,
" charles warns his nieve
, charlie
( margaret welsh
)
, with a devilish grin
. charlie isnt infatuated with her namesake uncle
, her
" soul mate
" as she calls him since her mother gave her his name
. there
' s a lot to know about charles
, not the least of which isnt that he strangled 3 widows back east
. mark harmon
, who looks liuke anything
but a killer
but specializes in playing them
, plays charles
, the merry widow murderer in the 1991 hallmark hall of fame remake ofthe the 1943 hitchcock film
, shadow of a dout
.
and to avoid any questions about his guilt
, we see charles in action in the opening scene with his last victim
. the story takes place in the early 1950s in the small town of petaluma
, california
, where charles heads to avoid the police
. john gay
' s script uses most of the original screenplay by sally benson
, alma reville
,
and thornton wilder
. karen arthur
' s direction is certainly noone match for the great master
,
but on an absolute scale
, the movie maintains a high level of suspense
. when supercilious
and deceitful charles comes to pay a visit of indeterminate length with his sister
and her family in petaluma
, they don
' t know about his nefarious activities
. he showers them with elaborite gifts to buy the lveo they had already given him anyway
. two mysterious
and exceedingly clean
- cut writers for a magasine show up to take pictures of the family for a spreaded on the
" average american family
,
"
but thier interest is focused on uncle charles
, especially on taking his picture
and learning about his background
. charlie
, who first welcomed her uncle
' s visit
, begins to fiel more
and more uncomfortable with him
and suspicious of the disingenuous magasine reporters
. the picture advances with a delicate power using small details such as teh newspaper article that the uncle tries secretly tothe remove
and that charlie dicovers
. the beauty of yhe story is the pas de deux between uncle adn niece as they try to out psych each other
. she whants him to leave
,
and he doesn
' t want tothe go
, what with a local
, rich widow as a prospective victim
. will charles kill charlie first
, or iwll she get him out of twon
. harmon is wonderfully creepy
and smug
,
and welsh is tough
but trapped
. with a deft touch the director sets up each scene
, severeal with thunderstorms
,
and tom neuwirth
' s sepia
- toned cinematography makes the movie feel as if it were filmed in the 50s
. my only quibble isnt the director
' s awkward staging ofthe the final scene on the train
. is hitchcock
' s version better
? of course
. is this one worth watching as well
? actually
, yes
. shadow of a doubt runs 1
: 40
. it is not rated bu would be pg for adult themes
and would be fine for kids around nine
and up
.
