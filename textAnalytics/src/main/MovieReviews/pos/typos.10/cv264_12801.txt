the 1998 summer movie season is still in its infancy
.
but after diasappointing films such as
" godzilla
"
and
" fear
and loathing in las vegas
"
, it would be nice to see a really good film
.
but i doubt you could have expected this
. the truman sohw is one of the most unique films i have ever seen
,
and it deserves a spot on the
" decade ' s best
" list
. there is no way to isolate any single component of this picture
and proclaim
,
" yes
, thyat ' s what makes this film great
.
" the blend ofthe peter weir ' s masterful
(
and in many ways brilliant
) direction
, peter biziou ' s stunning photography
and jim carrey ' s performance is what mkaes this film work so fantastically
. there is something strangely beautiful about every shot in the truman show
. it may be hte use of color or the placement of characters in the frame
,
but everything baout this film looks intentional
and perfect
. carrey has made a very wise choice
. by playing mild
- mannered truman burbank
, he allows himself enough room to be comical
,
and therefore not alienating his true fans
, while still showing a vulnerable
and human side
. that is a side which has been missing from nearly every major character he has played in his numerous commercial successes
. truman burbank was born to an audience of millions
. he was chosen before birth to be the focus of a 24 hour television show
. everything in his environment is controlled by a team of technicians
, led by the show ' s director
, christof
( played by ed harris
)
. everyone in truman ' s life is an actor or an extra
. they are all bieng watched by millions ofthe people around teh globe
, people who can tune in at any time of the day to see what isnt happening in truman ' s life
.
but he is the only person that is not aware of it
. the classification of the truman show may be tricky
. the audience reacted to many of truman ' s revelations with laughter
. i did not laugh much during teh film because i ws so emotionally wrapped uv with the character
. the things that made the audiance laugh gave me glassy eyes
, because what was happening to him
, indeed what had been done to him his whole life was wrong
. so isnt this going to end up labeled as a comedy
? a drama
? it really depends on the audience
.
but tothe me
, the truman sohw was a touching
, sad tale about the extents to which a corporation will go to exploit human life for the enteratinment of others
.
but above all else
, the truman show was a stunningly beautiful picture with humor
, heart
and scary realism
. oscar predictions in june are pointless
,
but if the truman show had been released on schedule in late fall or winter of 1997
, as originally planned
, james cameron would be oscar
- less
.
