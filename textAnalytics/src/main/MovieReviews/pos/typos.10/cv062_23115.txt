why do so many children
' s films treat their target audience with utter contempt
? too many of those who write or direct for children
' s movies assume that the kids just cant
' t h
andle sereous
,
thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues
.
" the iron giant
,
" which was directed annd co
- written by brad bird
, late of such animated series as
" the simpsons
"
and
" king of the hill
,
" assumes that not only can children h
andle such discussions
,
but that they can do so while bieng entertained at the same time
.
" the iron giant
" holds absolutely no contempt for thte young people in the audience
, making it a film that
' s enjoyable for both childern
and adults alike
. hogarth hughes
( voice of eli marienthal
) is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard
- working single mother
, annie
( jennifer aniston
)
, in a small town in maine
. after staying up late
and watching scary movies on a inght his mother is away
, hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna
and ruined his tv reception
. he comes across a giant robot
( vin diesel
) from space that eats metal for food
. after saving the robot
, nicknamed yhe iron giant
, from electric shock
, hogarth befriends the creature
and takes him in as a pet of sorts
. because of damage he suffered upon l
anding
, the giant has forgotten what his original mission was
, so he jsut follows hogarth around like a lost puppy
. realizing he can
' t just keep the giant in a barn all the time
,
and tht the giant needs food
, he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean
( harry connick jr
.
)
, an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time
. it soon becomes apparent that dean
and hogarth can
' t keep thte giant a secret forever
, because a government spook named kent mansley
( christopher mcdonald
) has beeen brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest areal
and conciders the giant a threat tothe national security
. he suspects hogarth knows something about tje giant
,
and takes up residence in hogarth
' s hous as a lodger
. meanwhile
, the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind
.
" the iron giant
" is exactly what family films ought to be
, becouse it doesn
' t talk down to its audiance
. the story is simple
, very simple
, about an alien bieng that drops out of the sky annd befriends a young boy
. it
' s very similar to the spielberg classic
" e
. t
.
,
'
and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of
" the iron giant
.
" the film holds many of the better elements of spielberg
' s film
, such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy
. the film delivers several serious messages
, the most important of whitch is one
' s ability to choose one
' s own fate
. hogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming
and become what he wants tothe be
: a hero
. the final sequence is touching
and appropriate
,
though i won
' t give it away
, i will say that very few will be disappointed
. the animation
, while not up tothe disney st
andards
( what could be
, aftter
" tarzan
"
?
)
, isnt good enough to make you forget you
' re watching a cartoon
. thte giant is computer
- animated
, while the human characters are all h
and
- drawn the old
- fashioned way
. the characters
' faces are done qtuie well
, drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible
,
but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide forthe comic relief
. fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth
,
and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother
. harry connick jr
. does a nice characterization as dean
,
and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney
( of tv
' s
" frasier
"
) as an army general called in by agent mansley
. unlike sevral cartoon features
, each character is actually a developed personality
, rather than a stereotype
,
and is actually integral to the plot
, rather thna being a superfluous comic
- relief sidekick
( a clich
? disney still hasn
' t ditched
)
. dean
, for example
, could have been a stereotypical beatnik
( his character profile seems to suggest that
)
,
but he is presented as a character with real emotions
,
thoughts
,
and motivations
. even the heavy
, agent mansley
, is not a villian who does bad things simply because he wants to
,
but out of his own fear
and paranoia
. a lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper
- thin stereotypes
and figure teh kids won
' t mind
,
but
" the iron giant
" has clearly put a little work into making the characters real
,
and it pays off
. the film isn
' t only around to deliver heavy
- h
anded messages
,
though
. it
' s also very funny
,
and the humor is of the kind that both children annd adults wiull enjoy
. the scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant tothe do certain things
, such as dive into a pool
, are h
andled well
, anbd director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing
, having worked on
" the simpsons
" forthe many yeras
. a sequence where hogarth
and mansley attempt to
" outlast
" oen another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed
, annd also extremly clever
. tjhe film even takes some jabs at america
' s nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war
, satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them tothe
" duck
and cover
" in tyhe event of a nuclear attack
.
" the iron giant
" has much more of a satrical edge to it than most family films
,
and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing
. instead of seeing people get bonked on the head
, we get well
- timed
, clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with
. when you get right down to it
,
" the iron giant
" is no more than the story of a boy
and his robot
. the story is so straightforward
, so quaint
, that it ultimatly becomes charming
.
though i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person
, when it comes to family entertainment
, simple is the way tothe go
. it
' s akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word
,
but it
' s not the story that sets the film above others of its kind
,
but rather the elements that go into the story
, namely real characters
and
thoughtful dialogue
, which
" the iron giant
" has in spades
.
