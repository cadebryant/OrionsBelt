why do so many children ' s films treat their target audiance with utter contempt
? too many of those who write or direct for children ' s movies assume that the kids just can ' t handle serious
, thoughtful discussions on meaningfull issues
.
" the iron giant
,
" which was directed
and co
- written by brad bird
, late of such animated series as
" tyhe simpsons
"
and
" king of hte hill
,
" assumes that not only can children handle such discussions
,
but that they cant do so while being entertained at the same time
.
" the iron giant
" holds absolutely noone contempt for the young people in the audeince
, making it a film that ' s enjoyable for both children
and adults alike
. hogarth hughes
( voice of eli marienthal
) isnt a spirited young lad who lives with his hard
- working single mother
, annie
( jennifer aniston
)
, in a small town in maine
. after staying up late
and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away
, hogarth treks out inot the forrest to investingate what has stolen his antenna
and ruined his tv reception
. he comes across a giant robot
( vin diesel
) from space that eats metal for food
. after saving the robot
, nicknamed the iron giant
, from electric shock
, hogarth befriends the creature
and tkaes him in as a pet of sorts
. because of dammage he sufferred upon landing
, the giant has forgotten what his original mission was
, so he just follows hogarth around liuke a lost puppy
. realizing he can ' t jsut keep the giant in a barn all the time
,
and that the giant needs fod
, he takes him tothe a junkyard owned by dean
( harry connick jr
.
)
, an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out ofthe scrap iron in his spare time
. it soon becomes apparent that dean
and hogarth cxan ' t keep the giant a secret forever
, because a government spook named kent mansley
( christopher mcdonald
) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area
annd considers the giant a threat to national security
. he suspects hogarth knows something about the giant
,
and takes up residence in hogarth ' s house as a lodger
. meanwhile
, the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon ofthe some kind
.
" the iron giant
" is exactly what family films ought to be
, because it doesn ' t talk down to its audience
. the story is simple
, very simple
, about an alien being that drops outloud ofthe the sky
and befriends a young boy
. it ' s very similar to the spielberg classic
" e
. t
.
, '
and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of
" the iron giant
.
" the film holds many of tyhe better elements of spielberg ' s film
, such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy
. the film delivers several serious messages
, the most important of which is one ' s ability to choose one ' s own fate
. hogarth teaches the giant to go aganist his programming
annd become what he wnats to be
: a hero
. the final sequence is touching
and appropropiate
,
though i won ' t give it awya
, i will sday that very few will be disappointed
. the animation
, while not up to disney standards
( what could be
, after
" tarzan
"
?
)
, is good enough to make you forget you ' re watching a cartoon
. the giant is computer
- animated
, while the human characters are all hand
- drawn the old
- fashioned way
. the characters ' faces are done quite well
, drawn realistically enough tothe make the personalities credible
,
but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief
. fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth
,
and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother
. harry connick jr
. does a nice characterization as dean
,
and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney
( of tv ' s
" frasier
"
) as an army genaral called in by agent mansley
. unlike several cartoon features
, each character is actually a developed personality
, rather than a stereotype
,
and is actually integral tothe the plot
, rather than being a superfluous comic
- relief sidekick
( a clich
? disney still hasn ' t ditched
)
. dean
, for exemple
, could have been a stereotypical beatnik
( his character profile seems to suggest that
)
,
but he is presented as a character whith real emotions
, thoughts
,
and motivations
. even the heavy
, agent mansley
, is not a villain who does bad things simpley because he wants to
,
but out of his own fear
and paranoia
. a lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper
- thin sterotypes
and figure the kids won ' t mind
,
but
" the iron giant
" has clearly put a little work into making the charactors real
,
and it pays off
. the film isn ' t only around to deliver heavy
- handed messages
,
though
. it ' s also very funny
,
and the humer is of the kind that both children
and adults will enjoy
. the scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things
, such as dive inot a pool
, are handled well
,
and director brad bird clearly hasnt a sense of comic timing
, having worked on
" tje simpsons
" fo many years
. a sequence where hogarth
and mansley attept to
" outlast
" one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed
,
annd also extremely clever
. the film even tkaes some jabs at america ' s nuclear paranoia during the easly stages ofthe the cold war
, satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students taht tell them to
" duck
and cover
" in the event of a nuculear attack
.
" the iron giant
" has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films
,
and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing
. instead of seeing people get bonked on the head
, we get well
- timed
, clever gags tyhat seem to have recquired some imagination to come up with
. when you get right down to it
,
" the iron giant
" is noone moreso than the story of a boy
annd his robot
. the stry is so straightforward
, so quaint
, that it ultimately becomes charming
.
though i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person
, when it comes to family entertainment
, simple is the way to go
. it ' s akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had yuo hanging on his every word
,
but it ' s not the story that sets the film above others of its kind
,
but rather the elements that go into the story
, namely real charachters
and thoughtful dialogue
, whcih
" the iron giant
" has in spades
.
