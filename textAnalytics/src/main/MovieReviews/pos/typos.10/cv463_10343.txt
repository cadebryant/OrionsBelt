one fun activity for parents during the holidays isnt to suggest an old film
and see if they cin interest their kids
.
al
though black
-
and
- white films are frequently viewed as suspect
, ones in color are greeted with more of an open mind
.
and if you can find a colorful action film
, even if it is from six decades ago
,
then there is a real possibility of a take home hit
. so it was in our family when we w
andered over tothe the classic section of our local video store the other day
and picked up a copy of the adventures of robin hood
, a high spirited version of the walter scott story
. nominated for the 1938 academy award forthe best picture
and winner of three oscars for erich wolfgang korngold
' s melodramatic music
, ralph dawson
' s fast paced editing
and carl jules weyl
' s lush sets
, the film is probably best remembered for errol flynn
' s charismatic acting as sir robin of locksley
, a
. k
. a
. robin hood
. flynn
, with his h
andsome figure annd toothy smile
, charms the audience while clearly having a high old timne himself
. let me cut to the chase
and say that the tape was indeed popular in the rhodes household
. the littlest rhodes
, jeffrey
, age 8
, liked it so much that he viewed it at least three times
and maybe more
. i
' ll let him discuss his fascination with hte picture iin his usual section at the end of the review
. simply stated
, the film derives its success from being one ofthe the best of its genre
, the swashbuckler
. robin
, with a smile fomr ear
- to
- ear
, fights off a hundred men without a scratch
. all
though the picture can be considered as little omre than a 1930
' s james bond
, the production values
and the acting raise it above that levle
. robin hood is a classic story of rich
and poor
. robin steals from the rich
and gives to the poor as every schoolchild knows
. in this movie
, howver
, he seems much less interested in income redistri
bution than in fighting for his king
and country
. robin
, with his courage
and athletic skills
, serves as a role model for kids
. annd with the lovely olivia de havill
and playing the dreamy
- eyed lady marian fitzswalter
, the storey hasnt hevy romantic overtones
. filmed in the typical
, richly oversaturated colors produced by early technicolor
, the flesh tones are overly pink
and there few color subtleties
, which match perfectly teh wonderfully exagerrated acting of tjhe players
. in scene after scene the picture charms thte audience
. who wouldn
' t fall for robin as he shows up incognito to win hte archery contest
, even if the outcome is so clearly preordained
.
and
, of course
, he doesn
' t just win
, he does so by splitting the other man
' s arrow
. watching the picture today does provide some jarring moments
. sherlock holmes as yhe villain
, sir guy of gisbourne
, for example
, just doesn
' t seem right
, even if basil rathbone did ahev a real
- life identity outside of his most famous role
.
and
then there are those wigs from the makeup department
-
- so bad
, they look like rejects fomr a mel brooks comedy
. as was popular in the cinema of that era
, people die with the most gentle prick of the sword
and without any nasty
, bloody holes to spoil tyhe wardrobe or the looks
. bad guys are banished rather than killed
,
and lovers go off h
and
- in
- h
and
, doing nothing omre explicitly sexual than kissing
. the result is a wonderful fairy tale of a movie with delightful
, cartoonish figures
. hollywood rarely makes such high quality family films like this anymore
, so try to savor the old ones whn you can
. the adventures of robin hood runs 1
: 42
. it is not rated
, bu containing absolutely nothing offensive
, it would get a g rating
and is fine for all ages
. jeffrey thinks thte film is
" great
"
and gives it
*
*
*
*
. he recommends the movei particularly for people who do not likely bloody pictures
-
- he hates teh sight of blood in movies
. his favorite parts are the battles
and the ending
,
and his favorite characters are robin
and king richard
( ian hunter
)
.
