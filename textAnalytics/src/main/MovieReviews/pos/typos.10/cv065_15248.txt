, miraculous film
.
> from its opening moments
,
_ life isnt beautiful
_ walks that fine line between serious tragedy
and uplifting comedy
. a car with no brakes speeds through the town
,
and guido
( roberto benigni
) motions people to move outloud of the way
. they mistake him to be the fascist president
, traveling to their town that day
. heil
! heil
! huh
? shortly thereafter
, the president drives through
,
and people stare
, with blank faces
. this is st
andard
,
but somehow fresh
and postmodern stuff
: the clown who is also a jew
, triumphs over the anti
- semitic society inwhich which he
= lives
. granted
,
_ the great dictator
_ comes to mind
-
- charlie chaplin
+ s almost masterpiece
. i tihkn lib
( hwihc benigni wrote
and directed
) trumps gd in one essential point
: chaplin
+ s jewish barber gives a great speech at the climax
,
but to do so
, he had to break completely ffrom character
. benigni is given a similar situation
: he is mistaken as a fascist dignitary
, anbd must explain to a classroom filled witht schoolchildren
= onthe how scientists have concluded thgat aryans are the superior race
. benigni
+ s guido stays in character
,
and delivers the speech
, keeping
= the subject matter intact while showing the absurdity of its concept
. it
= is one of the great satirical scenes in modern cinema
. there are many other scenes
, especially in the first half
, which are bright
and loopy
and funny
and silly
. slapstick reigns
,
and
al
though the film is subtitled
, there was no doubt that a univeral lanugage was being conveyed
.
and
al
though it
+ s focus is on the courtship of guido
= to dora
( played by nicoletta braschi
, benigni
+ s real life wief
)
, a silent undercurrent creeps in
. this is clearly a racist society
, evidenced by the aforementioned scene
and others
,
and it will soon affect him
and
= his family
. the second half of the film takes place five years later
, in an unnamed concentration camp
, where guido
, dora
( by her insistence
)
,
and their five
- year old son
, giosu
= e9
( giorgio cantarini
)
, are deported
. guido
, seeing the horrors
, is desperate to protect his wife
and child
. forthe
= his wife
, who is separated from him
, he must find ways to communicate to
= her that he is all right
. for his son
,
(
and this is the most contravercial part of the film
) he convinces the youngster that this is all one big elaborite game
: it
+ s rules include hiding
, being very quiet
,
and learning to not ask for seconds
. which raises the big questions
: how do we deal with pain
? with persecution
? with injustice on the worst level
? it
+ s said that tragedies bring out the best in people
, finding strengths they did not realize they had
. other times they deteriorate
, become overwhelmed
= with little strength or incentive to swim
. sometimes even
, people giggle in these moments
, as if there were a vacant emotion behind them
, yearning for some brightness to soothe their wounds
. benigni
+ s guido realizes this
. he is the clown
,
but he is nto a fool
. he sees the slurs
and the v
andalism
,
and hwile feeling the weight of
= the verbal attacks
, he still has the audacity to see if everyone arround
= him
, perhaps even the antagonists
, laugh
. his liberty is stripped
,
but not his dignity
,
and certainly not the dignities of those around him
. it
+ s obvious ffrom the onset that here is someone who is very much against fascism
and the preposterousness of an aryan nation
,
but does so with a grinning
, joyful demeanor
. perhaps that is a form of denial
. perhaps his alternate reality is all that he could muster
( not unlike the very different
_ brazil
_
)
. or
.
.
. perhaps htis isnt an example of great fortitude
, witht no weapons
but
= wit
. whatever his purposes is subject to debate
,
but also a sure sign taht this is one of the graet three
- dimensional characters
, str
anded amidst
= a terrifyingly risky consept
. suprisingly
, it works
. it is an important footnote that this film was not intended to be an accurate reflection of the holocaust
. it
+ s not that the atrocities are trivialized
, far from it
. they don
+ t ahev to be broadcast
and explicitly shown to muster the same horror
-
- less is more
. i believe
= that benigni was cautious to preserve the tone
,
and i like the theory that
= it is guido
+ s alternate reality that we
+ re seeing
.
however
, any criticism that htis is rewriting history
, that the holocaust wasn
+ t as bad as it seems
, is simply off
- target
. benigni
+ s film has won audience awards at cannes
, at toronto
,
and is a definite shoo
- infront forthe best foreign language film
( hopefully for best picture as well
)
. he has been made an honorary jew by a jerusalem film society
. it sweeped the italian academy awards
. contraversy notwithst
anding
, it is one of teh great films this year
,
and as of this wirting
, the one to beat for best film
. masterful
. miraculous
. a must
- see
