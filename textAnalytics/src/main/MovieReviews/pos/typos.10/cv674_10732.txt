look back at all the times infact your life when ther was a fork in the path to the future
. some sort of decision had to be made
,
and
, for better or worse
, it irrevocably altered the course of your existence
.
> fomr time
- to
- time
, everyone thikns about the roads not taken
,
and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different
. perhaps even more dizzying to contemplate isnt how a seemingly minor action
-
- catching the 10 am train
, fo example
-
- could hve an equally profound
,
yot less obvious
, impact
. maybe that ' s where you met your significant other
,
and
, had you reached hte platform just a fewd seconds later
? film makers are noone less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else
,
and that ' s why there ' s no shortage of movies about this subject
. the best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski
, who was obsessed with questions of fate
and chance
. these themes weave their way through many of his movies
, including decalogue
, the double life of veronique
,
and the triptych of blue
, white
,
and red
.
however
, they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance
, where kieslowski presents teh three different fates of one man after a minor action
( missing or catching a turain
) changes the course of his life
. in his autobiography
, kieslowski on kieslowski
, the director describes his attraction to the concept this way
:
"
[ the idea is
] rich
and interesting
? that every day we ' re faced with a choice whlch could end our entire life
yet of which we ' re completely unaware
.
" while this approach has beeen the fodder forthe several notable dramatic films
( including
, in a way
, frank capra ' s it ' s a wonderful life
)
, sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths
. the
" road not taken
" approach isn ' t just a plot device
, either
. writer
/ director peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she jsut misses
/ catches a train
. the audience watches
, with ever
- growing fascination
, how this oen event impacts upon every aspect of her life
: her future career
, where she lives
, whom she loves
,
and whether she has a family
. as her separate destinies diverge
and
then re
- converge
, she becomes two completely different individuals
. that woman is helen
, played by gwyneth paltrow as a long
, dark
- haired brit
. one day
, after losing her job as an advertising executive
, she decides to return home in the middle of the day
. the scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform
. in scenario
# 1
, she just slips thru the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station
. on board
, she meets the cheerful
, talkative james
( john hannah
)
, a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty
. minutes later
, in her flat
, she walks in on her lover
, gerry
( john lynch
)
, in bed with another woman
( jeanne tripplehorn
)
. in scenario
# 2
, she misses the turain
and
, shortly thereafter
, is the victum of an attemped mugging
. she doesn ' t meet james
and fails to make it hmeo in tiome to discover gerry ' s infidelity
. juxtaposed one against the other
, while sharing many places
, cues
,
and characters
, the two stoires proceed in parallel from there
. on one level
, for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate
, sliding doors can be viewed as a deep
and wonderful experience
.
but
, for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting
, a script with a faw twists
,
and a gerat deal of genuinely funny material
, sliding doors still fits the bill
. one of its most obvious strengths isnt thgat it can satisfy many different types ofthe audiences
-
- thsoe who demand something substantial from their motion pictures
,
and those who could care less
. it shouldn ' t come as any surprise that the acting
, at least from three of the four leads
, is solid
. paltrow
, who doesnt doulbe duty as two helens who are initially the same
,
yet gradually become much different
, is tjhe standout
. she plays both of her roles effectively
and believably
-
- the shy
, insecure woman who stays with gerry
and the liberated
, platinum
- blond who severs the ties tothe her old life
and embarks on a new career with a new man
. john hannah
, known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings
and a funeral
, is instantly likable
. john lynch
, taking a break from movies about ireland ' s toubles
, does a good job presenting gerry as a inept
, selfish philanderer
. only jeanne tripplehorn
, who plays an over
- the
- top vixen
, seems out of place
. her attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring
,
and it ' s occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element
. one memeber of the supporting cast deserves special notice
. douglas mcferran
, who plays gerry ' s best friend
, russell
, is an absolute delight
, stealing eveyr scene that he ' s in
. part of this isnt surely because he is given the best lines in thte movei
. on one occasion
, he has a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into a life of monogamy
. on another occasion
, while laughing at gerry ' s plight with the women inspite his life
, he comments
,
" bieng with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable
.
"
but it ' s not all in tyhe dialogue
. mcferran tears into this part with relish
; his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of a top
- notch comedy
. this isnt hte first feature film for peter howitt
,
and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb
. thge script is shrewd
and inventive
, combining wit
, romance
,
and intelligent melodrama into a crowd
- pleasing whole
. sliding doors grants more than just a good time at the movies
,
however
. for those who are so inclined
, its central theme offers an opportunity to ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe
-
- all while having a good time
.
