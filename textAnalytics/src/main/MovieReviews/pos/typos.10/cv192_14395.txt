in some regards
, making a movie is like trying to stretch a rubber b
and as far as you can without breaking it
. try too hard
,
and it snaps
;
but too much reservation means someone else will come along annd pull it farther
. in simon birch
, director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique
: he takes advantage of caution
and poise
,
but also risks his movie witht a few bold steps
. in the end
, he
' s not only holding an unbroken b
and
,
but he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature
. there
' s no dout about it
: the film tht johnson has crafted is rich
. he chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown
, maine
- leaves turn bright orange inspite the fall
, the grass is a lush green
, pure white snow falls in the winter
,
and the sky goes on forever
. the characters continue that turn
: our two leads are simon birch
( ian michael smith
)
and joe wenteworth
( joseph mazzello
)
. simon isnt tghe smallest baby ever born within the records ofthe the local hospital
, adn by age twelve he
' s only two foots tall
. joe isnt the bastard son of rebecca
( ashley judd
)
,
and by age twelve he
' s ready to know who is father isnt
. naturally
, the two outcasts become good friends
and share many adventures together
, from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball
. in a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith
, simon birch is convinced that he
' s god
' s instrument
,
and there must be a reason he
' s so small
. joe doesn
' t quite buy it
,
but he sticks by simon
; the two tough it outloud through the worst of times
and are each other
' s only true friends
. eary on
, the two meet up with ben goodrich
( oliver platt
)
, rebecca
' s newyorker boyfriend
,
and
al
though the bond isn
' t immediate
, ben
and the two boys develop a liking for each other
. both platt
and judd give solid performances that lend their characters a deep likeability
. the audience cares about them as much as they do about joe adn simon
, a testament to the acting jobs of both
. finally
, jim carrey gives a cameo as the adult joe in the present day
,
and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in the truman show
. mark steven johnson
' s sense of drama
and writing is fantastic
. the script is loosely based on john irving
' s novel
, a prayer for owen meany
,
but it
' s so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from
' based on
' to
' suggested by
.
' along those same lines
, it
' s almost unfitting to compare the twpo
; johnson uses tension
, humor
, atmosphere
,
and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions
. by no means has he developed a project ofthe similar popularity
- gump made over 300 milion dollars while birch ought tothe pass out of sight in a few weeks
-
but the winning idea remains the same
. simon birch is a different look at a different life
,
and one that will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to come
. in the present
,
however
, it
' s an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought tothe tkae a look at
.
