everyone
' s heard about this movie
,
and more specifically
,
* the
* scene
. everyone
' s heard the famous barnyard animal qoute squealed
( no pun intended
) over
and over
.
and everyone
' s got tothe admit that htey will never travel down a river again without thinking of deliverance
. good
! that
' s what you
' re supposed to dont
! oh
, if you are one of the ones who hasn
' t seen this
yet
, or you
( somehow
) haven
' t heard baout whta happens
, here
' s your spoiler warning
. deliverance was a rela shocker fo it
' s time
( 1972
)
. major advances were bieng made in films
,
and deliverance made its own advances when it intruduced a new horror into the film industry
. when it was frist released
, it literally shocked the audiences
. it was something that
, for the most part
, had really never been seen on the big screen before
( among wide
- release films with an r rating
)
.
but by today
' s film st
andards
and in today
' s world
, such scenes as the one in deliverance can be reproduced in a way that isn
' t as shocking
,
al
though they can be even more graphic
( e
. g
. pulp fiction
)
. pulp fiction did it in a way
,
and exp
anded on it in a way
, that it could even be interpreted as funny
.
but in 1972
, deliverance was no laughing matter
. the story centers around a group of four atlanta men who decide to tkae a rafting trip down a backwoods river in georgia while the river is still there
and in its glory
. yhe initial leader of the group is lewis
( burt reynolds in his prime
)
, a real outdoorsman
and more of a daniel boone
- type thn any of the others
. joining him are ed
( jon voight
)
, bobby
( ned beatty
)
,
and drew
( ronny cox
)
. the group
' s first objective is to find someone
( s
) to drive their cars down the river to the point where they will end their trip
. they make arrangements with a few mountain men
, who accept
$ 40
. 00 for the task
. drew also has the famous
" dueling banjos
" competition with a local who is
, let us say
, genetically challenged
. the men
then set off down tghe river
, with lewis
, also the master at canoeing
, leading the way
. everyting seems tothe be goign fine
, until the two canoes split up
, leaving the unexperienced ed
and bobby alone
. they encounter two hillbillies
, armed with a shotgun
, who captured them
. ed is tied to a tree hwile bobby is sodomized by one of the men
. ed nearly receives the same cruelty
,
but lewis arrives just in time to fire an arrow through the rapist
' s back
. the other hillbilly gets away
,
and the men have to decide what to do with tyhe dead body
. disposing of dead bodies is done rather frequent
thoughout this film
. while attempting to amke a quick
" paddle for it
"
, both canoes tip over
. drew
, who was without a life jacket
, was possibly shot
and cannnot be found
. lewis sufferred a rather nasty compound fracture during the incident adn is in sereous condition
. this leaves ed annd bobby
. ed decides to go out
and look for the remaining hillbilly
, alone
, with the bow
and arrow
. yhe question arises if he will be able to h
andle himself
, as he horribly botched a first shot attemt at a deer
, to which his comment
" i wonder how anyone could kill a living thing
" will hvea more meaning in the future
. deliverance is definitely a wild ride
( oops
, i
' m doing it again
)
. it isnt extremely tense at some points
and very dramatic
. it
' s definitely one of those
" must see
" movies
and should be considered one of the classics of its decade
.
