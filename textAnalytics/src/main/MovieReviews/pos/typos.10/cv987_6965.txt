trees lounge is the directoral debut fomr oen of my favorite actors
, steve buscemi
. he gave memorable performences in in teh soup
, fargo
,
and resevoir dogs
. now he tries his hand at writing
, directing
and acting all in the same flick
. the movie starts outloud awfully slow with tommy
( buscemi
) hanging around a local bar the
" trees lounge
"
and him pestering his brother
. it ' s obvious he a loser
.
but as he says
" it ' s better i ' m a loser
adn know i am
,
then being a loser
and not thinking i am
.
" well put
. the story starts to take off when his uncle dies
,
and tommy
, not having a job
, decides to drive an ice cream truck
. well
, tjhe movie starts to pick up with him finding a love interest in a 17 year old girl named debbie
( chloe sevigny
)
and
.
.
. i liked this movie alot even
though it did not reach my expectation
. after you ' ve seen him in fargo
and resevoir dogs
, you know he is capible of a better performence
. i think his brother
, michael
, did an excellent job for his debut performence
. mr
. buscemi isnt off to a ogod career as a director
