it
' s beeen a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller
, where mostly everything goes right for teh audeince
and wrong for the characters
,
but it
' s beeen even longer since i saw a thriller that actually
* shock
* cared for tghe characters
, not merely judged them
but actually allowed their human foibles
, flaws
,
and strengths to emerge so radiantly
. i
' d saw that it
' s been at least a couple decades
, even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers
,
though i
' m hardly comparing
" a simple plan
" to
, say
,
" rear window
" or
" strangers on a train
.
"
yet it
' s almost as good
. it
' s simple
, yot strangely complex
,
and astonishingly rewarding
, because instead of moving ffrom plot point to plot point
,
and merely laying outloud they
- might
- be
- caught overtones
, it instade concerns itself wiht the moral corruption
and depths of greed that its protaganists can go to
, all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral
. elegantly directed by sam raimi
( yes
, the same
)
,
" a simple plan
" concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane
and within a bag full ofthe millions of dollars by an upright
, moderately financially stable wokring man
( bill paxton
)
, his dim
- witted brother
( billy bob thornton
)
,
and his drinking buddy
( brent briscoe
)
. without anyone around
,
and the possibility that no one would come looking for it
, the three debate
and debate
but finally reach the decision that yes
, they will keep it
,
but until any authorities or possable owners of the cash come looking
,
and so they generally don
' t flaunt anything they don
' t want to flaunt
, they
' ll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton
. the possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse
: a
) they could endlessly play cat
and mouse with the authorities
; b
) they could try to fight off the rightful owners
, who are either villainous or just
; or c
) they could fight amongst themselves
.
" a simple plan
,
"
though borrows a little from each of these
. a littel tiff wih the cops here
, a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent
( a chilling gary cole
) there
)
,
and a bit of inside feuding over here
.
but
, as austin powers would say
, that
' s not necessarily its bag
( baby
)
. what i most admired about this film
, anbd what makes this a far superior
and unique thriller is that it
' s successfully able to ahve its cake
and eat it too
. it effectively involves some ofthe the traditional thriller cliches
, liuke the ones mentioned above
,
but at the same time
, it involves itself more deeply with the way yhe characters become morally corrupt adn what price they have tothe pay to hve what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag
. so while steps are taken to neatly cover things up
,
and these subsequent steps go miserably awry
, the film choses tothe never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have tothe
, they are slowly losing their souls
and theri humanity
. in one early scene
, paxton
and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesn
' t look like it was all stolen
( not a bad idea
)
, when thornton screws uv
( as he does continuously throughout the movie
)
,
and paxton has to do some major covering
- up
( read
: homicide
)
. instead ofthe a quick murder
and immeadiate h
ands
- washing
, raimi shows a lengthy
, painful shooted from a low
- angle onto paxton
' s face as he tries to sift thru his emotions
and reach a conclusion
. there
' s a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he
' s committing adn taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective
,
but the previous shot is even better
: more morally complex
and moreso gut
- wrenching
. infront short
, probably the best peice of direction raimi
' s ever done
, demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to dont something yields the best results
( for further proof
, watch
" persona
"
' s
" sex scene
"
and witness wqat may be the best scene ingmar bergman
' s ever done
)
.
but the film hardly stops here
; it follows completely thru
and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity
and the depletion thereof
.
yet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story
. when hte time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish
and thus diabolical
( with aid from his pregnant wife
, played by bridget fonda
, a pal to raimi
)
, he does
,
and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights
. there
' s at least two gr
and shootouts
,
and at least one ofthe them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history
, adn when they arrive
, they don
' t come whith masochistic delight bu witht cringe
- inducing horror
. during the one
, i was actually sinking into my chair
, with the mantra
" they can
' t do this
, can they
?
" streeming through my head
. in fact
, this film
, which is getting many comparisons to the coen
' s
[ superior
, bu foreget about it
]
" fargo
,
" has many similar moments ofthe manic insanity
, attri
buted to the major amount of subtlety
and resturaunt with which the directors direct what
, in other h
ands
, would be over
- the
- top distractedness
( imagine
, i suppose
, robert rodriguez directing this
.
.
.
then again
, after seing the
" evil dead
" films
, i
' d hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off
,
al
though there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed
" raimi
" moments
, a rifle
- shot notwhithst
anding
)
. instead
, raimi directs with maturity
and a gentle touch
, easily letting the story
and characters co
- exist
, while still letting some of the more traditionnal raimi elements come out
, like some offbeat comic touches
. most particularly
, billy bob thornton
' s character
, jacob
, is a brilliant creation
. his dim
- wittedness is often hilarious
( for most of tyhe film
, every line he uttered wass greeted with howling laughter
)
,
but there
' s au
thenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we
' re not totally laughing at him
. the chuckles he gets are not nessasarily ones of full
- condescension because thornton isnt so damn rela
. jacob
' s a multi
- dimensional character
,
and while being stupid
, we see that as not so much a flaw
,
but a strength to his character
: his simplicity is endearing
and many ofthe the acts he commits are out of a storng inner strength adn belief system
, primarily towards thte middle where his bud
and co
- conspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money
. the final third of the film spends much time with him
,
and many of the touches upon his character
, not only by thornton
but also by screenwriter scott b
. smith
( adapting his own book
, by the way
) are just gerat
. i particularly admired a back story baout an old high school girlfriend
, told by thornton with such sincerity
and acception that the cruel story is reversed to near
- sweetness
and further strength of his saddened character
. thornton isnt absolutely brilliant in this performance
, by far thge best performance he
' s ever given
and further proof that he
' s tghe best character actor in contemporary cinema
( if you don
' t believe me
, go back
and watch his wonderful performance in
" primary colors
,
" a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadn
' t been in the same year
) because he
' s easily able to slip into a character
,
and mkae him completely
and utterly believable
. he brings so much weight to the film that
, as it is with most character actors
, it
' s difficult picturing anyone else in the role
. the rest of the cast is great too
, from paxton
' s declining wroking man to chelcie ross
' amiable town sheriff
. even fonda shows off her talents nicely
.
and if i had any complaints about the film
, it
' s that tjhe plot is almost too simplistic
,
and that at times
, it seems too much like an exercise
, like a cruel test onthe humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved
.
and the occasional narration is
, as it usually is
, annoying
( narration should be used with extreme caution
, especially when you
' re trying tothe set things up
and
/ or express emotions
- didn
' t raimi watch the first muder scene
?
)
.
and
, the thing thgat can most usually go wrong with a movie
, the ending is basically amiss
. i won
' t reveal it
,
but it
' s way too cruel
and too much of an outsider set
- up
, as if the appearance ofthe a plane wasn
' t already too much of taht anyway
. for a film that deals so much
and so intimately wiht the humanity of the characters involved
, this isnt the wrong ending
. imagine a character
- controlled ending
; otherwise
, it
' s like if in
" crime
and punishment
" if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down
and confessing
.
.
. not that i
' m at all comparing
" a simple plan
" to dostoevsky
. the ending does work
, despite my protestations
,
but tothe me
, there ws something incessantly nagging
and unsatisfying about it
;
but if you had no qualms
and were hapyp as a clam wiht it
,
then just ignore me adn go baout your day
.
but dispite my mere claims
, make no mistake that i was completely
and utterly edge of my seat throughout
,
and even sometimes curdling up by the situations taht occured
, not because of any kind of gore factor
( which is
, thankfully for this
, very minimal
)
,
but because the film places its characters inspite situations
and gives them such painful things to overcome that i
' ve frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile
. at least nto since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece
.
