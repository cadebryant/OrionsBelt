affter hearing reviews for woody allen
' s upteenth movie in history
,
" celebrity
,
" range from terribly boring to just so
- so
, my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of
" manhattan
,
" my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time
. woody allen
' s films almsot never rely on visual flair over textual flair
, so wehn one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit h
and
- in
- h
and
(
" manhattan
" really is oen of the best
- looking films i
' ve ever seen
, beautyfull black
and white photography of the city
' s best areas
, etc
.
)
, a fan can
' t help
but feel visibly moved
. the film opens up
, with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds
,
and an old ironic st
andard palying on the soundtrack
, bu
then tjhe screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky
, with the word
" help
" being spelled with an airplane
. beethoven
' s 5th blasts onthe the soundtrack
. the city seems to stop to take notice of this moment
,
and it
' s all rather lovely to look at
. adn
then we cut to a film crew
, shooting this as the film
' s hilariously banal key moment in the film
, where the lead actress in the film
( melanie griffith
, looking as buxom adn beautiful as ever
) has to relize something
' s wrong with her life or whatever
. it
' s a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film
, with the great oppening shots or wihtout
,
and my heart sank anbd i soon got used to the fact that once again
, a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works
(
though
, for the record
, last year
' s
" deconstructing harry
" came awfully close
)
. what the hell hasnt happened to him
? the man who once coudl be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny
,
but his films have become less insightful
and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas
.
" bullets over broadway
,
"
though wonderful
, relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off
.
" mighty aphrodite
" is more full of great moments
and lines than a really great story
.
" everyone says i love you
" was more of a great idea than a great film
. even
" deconstructing harry
" is admittingly cheap in a way
, even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films
. if anything
, the reception of
" celebrity
" by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time
, it
' s not the audience
and critics who are wrong about how wonderfull his film is
: it
' s him
.
" celebrity
" is
, yes
, a good film
,
but it
' s only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film
. instead of creating the great woody allen world
, he
' s created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about
.
and he
' s fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities
, so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections
. it
' s like
" la dolce vita
" without the accuracy
, the right amount of wit
,
and the correct personal crisis
. woody
, becoming more insecure in his old age
, choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities
,
and
then hang him
and all his flaws up for scrutiny
,
and does this by casting not himself
but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead
. much has been said about his performance
- dead on
but irritating
, makes one yearn for the real thing
, blah blah blah
-
but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branagh
' s performance
,
though featuring some of the same mannerisms
( stuttering
, whining
, lots o
' h
and gestures
)
, is hardly a warts
-
and
- all impersonation
. branagh brings along with him little ofthe the woody allen charm
, which actually allows for his character
' s flaws to be more apparent
. woody
' s a flawed guy
,
and we know it
,
but we love him anyway
, because he
' s really funny annd really witty anbd really intelligent
. branagh
' s allen is a bit more flat
- out bad
,
but with the same charm so that
, yes
, we like him
,
but we
' re still not sure if he
' s really a ogod person or not
. his charater
, lee simon
, is first seen on the set ofthe the aforementioned movie
, hits on extra actress winona ryder
,
then goes off to interview griffith
, who tkaes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her
,
and she denies him
.
.
. sorta
. we
then learn
, through flashbacks
, that lee hasnt been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a mid
- life crisis
and an appearance at his high school reunion
. he has since quit his job as a travel journalist
and become a gossip journalist of sorts
, covering movie sets
and places where celebrities congregate
, so that he can meet them
,
and maybe sell his script
( a bank robbery movie
"
but with a deep personel crisis
"
)
. as such
, he hasnt divorced his wife of sevral years
( allen regular judy davis
)
,
and continues on a quest for sexual happiness
, boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend
and fling to fling over the course of the film
. after griffith comes his escapades with a model
( charlize theron
) who is
" polymorphously perverse
"
( glad to see allen is useing new jokes
, ha ha
)
, who takes him for a wild ride not different from tath of the anita ekberg segment ofthe
" la dolce vita
.
" following are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen
, a relationship that almost assures him succsess
,
and his continued escapades with ryder
, whom he fancies most of all
. his story is juxtaposed whith that of davis
, who flips out
, bu stumbles onto happiness when she runs inot a hansome
, friendly tv exec
( joe mantegna
) who l
ands her a job that furthers her career tothe national status
. hwile lee is fumbling about
, selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness
, davis becomes happy
(
" i
' ve become the kind of woman i
' ve always hated
.
.
. annd i
' m loving it
.
"
) without doing a thing
. the result is a film ofthe highs
and mediums
. the mediums are whta take up most of the film
, with sitations
and scenes which don
' t exactly work
but you can
' t help
but pat allen on the back for trying
.
but other places are raelly great scenes
. the opening
. the sequence with theron
, which is so good that i wished it hadn
' t ended
. a banana scene with bebe neuwirth
( droll as ever
)
.
and
, perhaps the best sequence
: a romp with hot
- as
- hell teen idol
, br
andon darrow
, played by none other than leo dicaprio
, who is so un
- dicaprio
- esque that if any of this fans coudl sit through this film
, they
' d never look at him the same way
. he ignites the screen with intensity
,
and spares nothing in showing his character as narcissistically tyrannical
,
and totally heartbreaking fo lee
, who comes to him to talk about his script taht he hasnt read
,
and finds himself on a wild all
- day ride with him
. they go tothe atlantic city to watch a fight
, they gamble
,
and they wind up in his hotel room
, where darrow gets it on with his flame
( gretchen mol
)
and he lends him one of the leftover groupies
. allen
' s writing in these scenes are so good thyat just for them
, i
' d almost recommend the film
. almost
. bu whta i really liked about this film isnt despite the fact that it
' s a mess
, despite the fact that wqat this film really needs is a good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself
, it
' s still a smart
and insightful film
.
though some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced
( some seem too cartoonish
, even fo this enivoriment
)
, allen still manages to get across that this film is not exactly about celebrities
, as it may seem to be
( if it were
, it
' d be extremely out
- ofthe
- touch
)
,
but about those who whant to be celebrities
,
and how they equate celebrity
- hood with happiness
. we never get close enough to the actual celebrities to see if they
' re realyl hapyp
( tehy may appear to be on tjhe surface
.
.
.
)
,
but we do get close enough to lee
and davis
' character
. lee is obsessed with the phenomenon
, while davis takes is at arm
' s length
, adn never gets too involved in whta it is
,
and soon becomes one herself
. besides
, it
' s witty
,
and it does have the oen thing that no otehr film has
but allen
' s
: that great woody allen feel
. it may be not exactly fresh
and lively or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject
,
and yes
, as a part of woody allen
' s ouevre
, it
' s merely a blip
( no
" annie hall
"
but it
' s no
" shadows
and fog
" either
)
,
but it goes tothe prove thgat no one can make a film like him
,
and only he
and maybe godard could possibly take a totally horrible metaphor
, like tjhe one in the beginning
, annd make it work not once
but twice
.
