. review
: a small
but enchanting movie
,
" hearts in atlantis
" easily recalls anyother king
- inspired comming
- of
- age film
,
" st
and by me
"
, both in terms ofthe its setting
and the sentiment it conveys
.
" hearts
" is a tri
bute to the magic of childhood
, to those summers when the days seem neverending
,
and nothing means more than your closest friends
. unlike
" st
and by me
"
, there is a supernatural element tothe
" hearts
"
,
but
al
though it is key to the plot
, it is not prominent
. like
" st
and by me
"
, this is a mostly character
- driven film
,
and as such it benefits greatly fomr superb casting
. yelchin is very good as bobby
, finding a ogod mix of innocence
and resignation
. moreso splendid still is boorem
, whom i praised highly for her work in
" along came a spider
"
and who is simply radiant here as carol
.
and
then ther is hopkins
, who despite playing such a quiet
, introspective character as ted
, nonetheless comm
ands our attention every time he is onscreen
. less successful is davis
, whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish
. i also found it odd that bobby
and carol
' s other friend
, sully
( whose death as an adult sets up the movie
' s flashback framing device
)
, is paid virtually no attention
.
but hicks
' direction is lovely wihtout being cloying
,
and despite tghe movei
' s general lack of incident
, it never ceases tothe weave its spell over the audience
.
