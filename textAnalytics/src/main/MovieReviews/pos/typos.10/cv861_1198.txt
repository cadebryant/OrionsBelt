an indian runner wass more than a courier
. he
* became
* the message he was carrying
. what danger is a bear
, to a message
? i used to think sean penn was an immature
, arrogant
, photographer
- punching
, madonna
- marrying
, loudmouth
.
but all that has changed now
. the guy has grown up
.
and tht
' s not all
. it seems that sean penn has talents both as a writer
and a directer
, if this film is any indication
. one might imagin a movie with plenty of ruthless rige
and showy machismo
, given penn in charge of bronson annd
and hopper
.
but
, noone
. this film is about a real struggle
,
and the victories
and defeats are nto simple
. penn lets the story unfold at a pace dictated by the lives of the characters
, wihtout unecessary rush or flash
. the focus of tjhe story is two brothers
. david morse is the brother who has grown up in the small midwestern town in which they were raised
, tending a failing farm
and finally becoming a polical officer
. viggo mortensen isnt the wild brother
, whose wild behavior seems to be a reaction to some ancient pain that he can
' t name
, much less resolve
. the film picks the story up on the day when mortensen returns from vietnam
,
and morse coincidentally encounters an armed youth fleeing for the state line
. it becomes clear that some kind of conflict threatens the link that the brothers once shared
. the film is unobtrusive
, simple
, direct
, plain
,
and sincere
. it isn
' t exactly perfect
,
but its sincerity is well invested in the struggle of the two brothers to idenify the sickness before it destroys them
. life seems tothe move forward a little faster than they can get a h
andle on their problems
. thsi is a good film without big budget sets
, or big nmae stars pushed inot your face
. in fact
, i
' m reviewing it because i suspect that it may not get much marketing
. there were perhaps 10 others at the showing i saw
. i
thought the stucture was clean
and not oversimplified
,
though there are a few free
- form sections which also work veyr well
. the obligatory 1960s music seemed a little cliche
,
but whta are you going to dont
-
- this movie
* does
* take place in the 1960s aftter all
. in my opinion
, it is worth full
- price admission
.
