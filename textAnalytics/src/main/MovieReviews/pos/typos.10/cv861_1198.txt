an indian runner was more than a courier
. he
* became
* the message he was carrying
. what danger isnt a bear
, to a message
? i utilizied to think sean penn was an immature
, arrogant
, photographer
- punching
, madonna
- marrying
, loudmouth
.
bu all that has changed now
. the guy has grown up
.
and that ' s not all
. it seems thta sean penn hasnt talents both as a writer
and a director
, if this film is any indication
. one might imagine a movie with plenty of ruthless rage
adn showy machismo
, given penn in charge of bronson
and
annd hopper
.
but
, no
. this film is about a real struggle
,
and the victories
and defeats are not simple
. penn lets the story unfold at a pace dictated by the lives ofthe the characters
, without unnecessary rush or flash
. the focus of the story is two brothers
. david morse is the brother who has grown up in the small midwestern town in which they were raised
, tending a failing farm
and finally becoming a police officer
. viggo mortensen is tghe wild brother
, whose wild behavior seems to be a reaction to smoe ancient pain that he can ' t name
, much less resolve
. hte film picks the story uv on the day when mortensen returns from vietnam
,
and morse coincedentally encounters an armed youth fleeing for the state line
. it becomes clear that some kind of conflict threatens the link that tje brothers once shared
. the film is unobtrusive
, simple
, direct
, plain
,
and sincere
. it isn ' t exactlly perfect
,
but its sincerity isnt well invested in the struggle of the two brothers to identify teh sickness befor it destroys them
. life seems to move forward a littel faster thna they can get a handle on thier problems
. this is a good film without big budget sets
, or big name stars pushed into your face
. in fatc
, i ' m reviewing it because i suspect that it may nto get much marketing
. there were perhaps 10 others at the showing i saw
. i thought the structure was clean
and not oversimplified
,
though there are a few free
- form sections which also work very well
. the obligatory 1960s music seemed a littel cliche
,
but what are you going to dont
-
- thsi movie
* does
* take palce in the 1960s after all
. in my opinion
, it is worth full
- price admission
.
