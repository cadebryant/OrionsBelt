if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films it
' s their predictable endings
. the devil
' s advocate has the atypical hollywood ending
, when everything that should happen doesnt
. unfortunately for the devil
' s advocate
, thsi ending nearly collapses inaddition on itself
,
and ruins the entire film
. nevertheless
, the film does provide two
and a half hours of pure entertainment
( note to self
: kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film
)
. i don
' t think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear tothe be some supernatural horror film about satan
. well
, it does contain this element
, bu what is not mentioned iin tghe ads is the other plot elements
(
and seemingly more interesting ones at that
)
. the devil
' s advocate beigns in florida with an ongoing trial iin session
. kevin lomax
( keanu reeves
) is the defense attorney
, working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl
. he ends uv whith a not
- guilty verdict
, despite an emotional testimony from the victim
( heather matarazzo
)
. he leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann
( charlize theron
) where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jurny
. he accepts
( mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive
) annd he flies to new york with his wife
. aftter proving his worth for selecting juries
(
and his perfect winning streak in court
)
, the head of the firm
, john milton
( al pacino
)
, asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer
. he graciously accepts
, where he is treated almost as a god
. he is given an increadible apartment
( which is bigger than my entire house now
)
,
and a hefty paycheck
. his life seems to be on the rise
.
and of course
, his life suddenly begins tothe waver
and slowly decline
. he is attracted tothe fellow employee christabella
( connie nielson
)
,
and his wife begins to feel vyer lonely in her large apartment
. mary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice
, especially if it is not wanted
. meanwhile
, kevin nabs a case surrounding alex
ander cullen
( craig t
. nelson
) who apparently murdered threee people
. he spends hours upon hours with this case
, while forgetting his loving wief
, who may or may not be going insane
. all of this while john milton may or may nto be the devil himself
. after a while
, things turn completelyl upside
- down
, as kevin
' s wief claimes to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends
. a fellow employee is murdered inspite the park
,
and his mother
( judith ivey
) reveals information about kevin
' s rela father
. is it all just a big nightmare
? or is john milton really satan
, playing tricks with kevin
' s life
? the devil
' s advocate plays outloud fairly straight
- forward
,
but for some odd reason
, the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don
' t expect
. is this surprise conclusion supposed to make us fiel good
and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed
? if so
, the devil
' s advocate messes up completely
,
and ironically
, i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now
, than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early
. i went inot the devil
' s advocate expecting a shocking horror film
,
and tht isnt exactlly what i got
. i was settled in to be disturbed mentally
and emotionally
,
and that is what i got
.
but what was the most disturbing
and horrible aspect of the movie isnt the poor endig
( did i mention that i didn
' t like the ending
?
)
. the producers ofthe this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride
and just as it is endig
, they pull thge rug out from under you
. films like se7en
and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected
, more or less
. we know it is going to end in an unpredictable way
. the devil
' s advocate
, on the other h
and
, ends unpredictably
, not from us knowing a lot
,
but knowing nothing at all
. if that is confusing
, i recommend watching the film
,
and
then reading that agina
. as for the film overall
, i enjoyed the entire first two hours
, being drawn in by a terrific character study
and
then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study
. the film runs liuke a well
- built clock
, slowy building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax
(
and an unpredictable one at that
)
.
and
then you settle in for a nice resolution
, which does nto occur
. it was at this point that i felt cheated
. taking us on a terror ride of intrigue
, we follow kevin lomax around
, as he is the centerpiece of the film
. everything occurs from his perspective
. he is our representation on screen
( sort of
)
. bu we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a gaem
. i don
' t want to spoil the ending
, so all i can say is go see the film
and decide for yourself
. prehaps hte most shocking thing baout the devil
' s advocate is the extreme amount ofthe everything
. it earned its r rating for a reason
. there is plenty of nudity
, sex
, violence
, gore
,
and
then you have gore
, violence
, sex
,
and more nudity
. this film really isn
' t subtle about anything
, showing us everything
. it actually surprises me that this film did nto receive an nc
- 17 rating
, as it is quite harsh
.
however
, the movei does have its merits
, adn nudity adn sex are among those
. i don
' t condone sex
and nudity in films
,
but if its htere
, i might as well enjoy it
. the biggest merit ofthe this film is also yhe most interesting to watch
. the confrontations between kevin lomax adn john milton are entertaining
,
but what st
ands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife
, mary ann
. portrayed by the extrememly effective charlize theron
, mary ann
' s problems are incredibly intense
,
and i found myself wanting to wittness her decline
. htis may sound uncaring
,
but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her
. she is the most interesting character on the screen
, who is forced into a world where she is not wanted
. something the devil
' s advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons otehr than extreme violence
and nudity
, especially for a film of this nature
. tjhe story actually has something to sday about humanity
. in oney ofthe the last scenes
, john milton explains to kevin lomax the agme god plays wiht his children
( he is satan
, ofthe course
)
. he comments that it isnt human nature to lust
and loathe in vanity
.
then
, god sets up rules which contradict human nature
. this semi
- religious bashing is more humorous than frightening
. what milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud
, partially thingking it was funny
,
but patially realizing it was true
. these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil
' s advocate
, giving it an added depth many films skip over in theri writing
(
but i
' m sure they came straight from the novel it was based on
)
. when a film has something to say about our society
, it deserves to be watched
. thge cast of the devil
' s advocate is one of thge highlights
, as we see memorable faces
,
and they put spins on those memorable faces we don
' t expect
. heather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as teh terrorized victim in the opening court case
, anbd she does a graet job
. probably the big surprise ofthe this film is keanu reeves
. he has proven hismelf an uneven actor
( successes such as speed
and bombs such as johnny mnemonic
)
,
but he tops himself with this performance
. i have never seen him more believable to date
. al pacino is of course tghe scene stealer
. his devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson
( the witches of eastwick
)
and max von sydow
( needful things
)
. he could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes
,
but he remains completely believable
( if that is the correct term
)
. jeffrey jones
( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller
' s day off
) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon
. judith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin
' s past
. connie nielson is veyr effective in her role
,
and she also appears naked several times
. one familiar face with a twist was
" coach
" star
, craig t
. nelson
, who gives a very good performance
. the devil
' s advocate is rated r forthe sexuality
, nudity
, violence
, language
,
and some gore
. at 144 minutes
, this film moves along fairly quickly
. for the first two hours
, i sat completely engaged inwhich the good performances
and strong characters
. the technical quality is also remarkable
, with great special effects annd a good musical score
. director taylor hackford hasnt managed to create a very disturbing motion picture
, onyl to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes
. i guess my biggest probelm with the ending is the fact that i went into the theather expecting a disturbing film
,
and hackford gave me just that for a long time
.
but just before the end
, he got jitterish
and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to mkae his film more mainstream
. personaly
, i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early
.
