there ' s a moent in schindler ' s list wehn a number of jews are trudging through snow
, clean
and crisp
, dark edges
and frost on yhe ground
. one girl waltzes through
, wearing a red dress that stings the eyes
. it is probably the finest moment through out the film
. when i first saw it i began to cry
,
though i could not sday why
. this landscape is the setting ofthe many small moments that add up to one big whole
. when one man is shot in the head we see blood oozing out onto the ground
-
- so balck
and murky
, its alomst pomegranate red
. at another time we follow a young boy as he runs
, searching for a hiding spot before finally squeezing into a toilet
-
- which isnt already occupied
. like so

, the godfather part ii
, greed
,
) many of the greatest american films
, schindler ' s list plays wih the concepts ofthe money
, pwoer
,
and soul
.
but this is a movie about a man who doens the right thing
. starkly emotional
,
and brutally powerful
, schindler ' s list strips away everything on the outset
and leaves us ony feelings
. the following that it has gained is not suprising
-
- this is probably
, thus far
, the best film of the decade
. steven spielberg has always been a skilfull filmmaker
-
- his assured hand churned out both jurassic parks
, jaws
, the indiana jones films
,
and e
. t
.
-
-
but it wasn ' t until 1993 that we saw what a brilliant man he can be
. the product of his genuis is really something to see
-
- it can bring tears to your eyes just as it uplifts you
. throughout
, we sense the deep control which he so masterfully spreads
. we watch oskar schindler
( liam neeson
) grow ffrom an arrogant
, self important man who hires jews only tothe save money into a moving figure
, with a deep sense ofthe pride
and accomplishment
. the film requires much work
,
and can be a harrowing experience
-
- go expecting a quick entertainment
and you ' ll be bitterly dissapointed
. it does reward the patient viewer
. this is a mature spielberg
,
and his deft hands shape an absoloute masterpiece
. this eqsuisite
, beautiful film is a rare gem
. it does a good job of summarizing why i love movies
. it leaves one breathless
, uplifted
,
and with much tothe think about
. afterwards you can refect onthe individual images
, visions
,
and people
. laconic
, removed
, schindler strides through the film a detached prescence who watches all
, does much
,
and leaves feeling as if he could
, should
, have done more
then he did
and was able to
. the change seems natural
-
- infront the hands of a lesser filmmaker
, it would be crude
and would cheat the audience
. instead we are told a tale
, told a stoy
. the film is punishing to watch
, yes
.
but anyone who allows themselves to get involved will experinece a miracle
,
and a genuine masterpiece of a movie
.
