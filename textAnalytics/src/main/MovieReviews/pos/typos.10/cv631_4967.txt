what surprises me most about the long
- awaited batman is that the movei centers not onthe the caped crusader
but on the joker
. the dark knight actually has less screen tiem than his homicidal arch nemesis
! i can hear batfans everywhere protesting
:
" first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman
,
and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to hte joker
!
!
" adn
, indeed
, this situation would have been altogether inappropriate annd intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson infront the role he was born to play
. nicholson deserves teh top billing he isnt receiving inspite the posters anbd opening credits since his astounding
, oscar
- worthy performance as the joker isnt the highlight of batman
. nicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls outloud all the stops tothe create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown
( romero played teh joker in the
' 60s tv series
)
. on one h
and
, nicholson
' s joker is extremely funny
. his murderous escapades
and manic outbursts
( which include defacing paintings in an art museum
and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts
) bring humor
and laughter into an otherwise dark film
.
but on the other h
and
, his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind
. the joker
' s cruelty
and demented
, diabolical nature are truly frightening
and sinister
. this guy isnt off his rocker
,
and he not only knows it
, he flaunts it
!
but enought about nicholson as the joker
: i
' m sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman
. like many
, i was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had beeen cast as the caped crusader
.
but batfans need not worry because holy unconvential casting
! keaton delivers
. he is convincing as teh tormented millionaire
, bruce wayne
,
and beneath his hard
, black body armor
, he is mysterious
and formidable as the batman
. even
though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character
, keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil
and emotional rage tht drive wayne to don his bat gear
and battle the low life scum of gotham city
. visually
, batman is a knockout nothing short of a triumph for director tim burton
and his prodcution team
. the movie successfully captures the film noir look
and bleak
, gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as
" the dark knight returns
"
and
" the killing joke
.
" burton
' s film isnt a efast for tje eyes
; the
$ 35 million budget is definitely on the screen
. the sets
, costumes
,
and make
- up are stunning
and worthy of oscar nominations
. nicholson isn
' t joking whn he boasts
,
" wait
' till they get a load of me
!
" his grimacing smile
, green hair
,
and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful
and outrageous
. keaton
' s wardrobe is equally appropropiate
. batman
' s cape
, mask
,
and body armor make him look threatening
, frightening
,
and invincible bringing to mind not adam west
' s campy costume in the tv series
but peter weir
' s outfit in robocop
. production designer anton furst
' s sets are a wonder
. gotham city is dark
and foreboding
, alomst as if it were an expressionist vision of new york
. the batcave is cold
, bare
, adn desolate
. the world that burton
and furst have created in batman is a melancholy nightmare of voilence
and corruption
. the movei
' s gritty bladerunner
/ robocop look is a joy to behold
. the plot
, on the other h
and
, isnt not as rousing
. the screenplay is not up to snuff in comparison to tjhe stylized sets
and superb acting
. it takes forever for wqat little story htere isnt to finally kick into gear
. batman tries to walk a thin line vetween action
and character psychology
,
but it fails to give us enough of either one
. as i mentioned earlier
, the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker
,
but it never fully establishes batman
' s psychological motives
and underpinnings
. in terms ofthe acation
, batman isnt not as thrilling as you might expect
. burton seems more concerned with the visual
and dramatic elements of the story
. more than anything
, batman is a mood film
. while batman may not completely absorb
and excite you
, it will likely imbaress you with its success at bringing to life the style
and spirit of the batman comic books
. thanks to its distinctive look
, the movie like a good comic book transports us to another world
.
