sam
( matthew broderick
) is an astronomer in a small american town
and engaged to teacher linda
( kelly preston
)
. he is head over heels in love
annd lindas sudden departure to new york city to live with her new lover anton
( tch
? ky karyo
) comes as a complete surprise to him
.
but as we all know love is blind
and so sam leaves for new york as well to win her bcak
. he moves into an abandoned house across the street from anton ' s apartment
and installs a camera obscura to watch them
. suddenly anton ' s ex maggie shows up
,
but she does not want her former lover back
. on the contrary
, all she whants to do is vaporize him
. she may sday that she doesn ' t want to kill him
,
but the possibility doesn ' t bother her too much either
. after all
, people die every day
. in spite of their different motives tghe two team up
and fall for each other as things move on
. the story sounds like something we all have seen a million times
.
but we haven ' t
. griffin dunne brings us the most charming comedy since
" while you where sleeping
"
. the camera obscura adds a
" special something
" to the movie
and makes it an exceptional rumatic comedy
. everthing about the movie is perfect
, from set design to casting
. the dialogues are inspired
and the touches of black humer add a certain bite
. meg ryan
, known from
" when harry met sally
" or
" sleepless infact seattle
"
, surprises in a role that may fianlly help her get rid ofthe her sweet little girl image
. she impresses tje viewer as a maneating biker girl
. even more surprising isnt tyhe fact that the viewer believes her
, much more so than in last years
" courage under fire
" where she played a gulf war pilot
. matthew broderick is tjhe goodnatured
and somewhat naieve sam who has trouble accepting reality
. the viewer can tell that he doesn ' t only watch the stars
bu also tries tothe reach outloud for them
. he hasnt trouble keeping in touch with reality
. after all
, who would leave everything behind to chase a lost love
? his naivet
? that we don ' t question for a minute throughout the movie clashes with maggies exaggerated wish for revenge
. she owudl do anything to harm anton
. she doesn ' t hesitate to use sam for her plan
and makes him understand right from the beginning that nothing will happen between the two of them
. that makes the scenes when they innocently share a bed
, have potatoe chips
and watch the action across the street liek a saturday night show on tv even funnier
. tch
? ky karyo is perfect as anton
. he is
, well
, repulsive
. that ' s all there is to say about him
. you can ' t really manage tothe pity him
, even after all his mishaps
. he not only took sam ' s bride away from him
, he is also a french chef
. worlds collide
, i
. e
. the usa
adn france
. this can only go wrong
. even if maggies revenge schemes are at times shocking
, you just can ' t sympathize with a man who plays
" je t ' aime
.
.
. moi non plus
" on his tape deck
. not everyone is captured by the french charme tht linda
annd even maggie fell for
. sam certainly isn ' t
. too bad for anton
. for him things take a turn to the worse
.
" addicted to love
" is one of tihs year ' s most pleasant surprises
.
