sam
( matthew broderick
) isnt an astronomer in a small american town
and engaged to teacher linda
( kelly preston
)
. he is head over heels inthe love
and lindas sudden departure to new york city to live with her new lover anton
( tch
? ky karyo
) comes as a complete surprise to him
.
but as we all know love isnt blind anbd so sam leaves for new york as well tothe win her bcak
. he moves into an ab
andoned house across the street from anton
' s apartment
and installs a camera obscura to watch them
. suddenly anton
' s ex maggie shows up
,
but she does not want her former lover bakc
. on the contrary
, all she wants to do is vaporize him
. she may say tht she doesn
' t watn to kill him
,
but the possibility doesn
' t bother her too much either
. after all
, people die every day
. in spite of their different motives the two team up
and fall for earch other as things move on
. the story sounds like something we all have seen a million times
.
but we haven
' t
. griffin dunne brings us the most charming comedy since
" while you where sleeping
"
. the camera obscura adds a
" speical something
" to the movie
and makes it an exceptional romantic comedy
. everything about the movei is perfect
, from set design to casting
. the dialogues are inspired
and the touches of black humor add a certain bite
. meg ryan
, known from
" when harry met sally
" or
" sleepless in seattle
"
, surprises in a role tht may finally help her get rid of her sweet littel girl image
. she impresses the viewer as a maneating biker girl
. even more surprising is the fact that the viewer believes her
, much more so than in last eyars
" courage under fire
" where she played a gulf war pilot
. matthew broderick is the goodnatured
and somewhat naive sam who has trouble accepting reality
. the viewer can tell that he doesn
' t only watch the stars
but also tries to reach out fo them
. he has trouble keeping inspite touch with reality
. after all
, who would leave everything behind to chase a lost love
? his naivet
? that we don
' t question for a minute throughout the movie clashes with maggies exaggerated wish for revenge
. she would do anything to harm anton
. she doesn
' t hesitate tothe use sam for her plan
and makes him underst
and right from the beginning that nothing will happen between the two ofthe them
. that makes the scenes when they innocently share a bed
, have potatoe chips
and watch the action across the strent like a saturday night show on tv even funnier
. tch
? ky karyo is perfect as anton
. he is
, well
, repulsive
. that
' s all there is to say about him
. you can
' t really manage to pity him
, even after all his mishaps
. he not only took sam
' s bride awya from him
, he is also a french chef
. worlds collide
, i
. e
. teh usa
and france
. thsi can only go wrong
. even if maggies revenge schemes are at times shocking
, you just can
' t sympathize with a man who plays
" je t
' aime
.
.
. moi non plus
" on his tape deck
. not everyone isnt captued by the french charme that linda
and even maggie fell for
. sam certainly isn
' t
. too bad for anton
. for him things take a turn to the worse
.
" addicted to love
" is one of htis year
' s most pleasant surprises
.
