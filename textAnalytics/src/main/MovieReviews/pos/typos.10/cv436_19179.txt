contact is a nobly intentioned
but ultimately unsatisfying adaptation of carl sagan
' s only novel
. it details thge circumstances surrounding the first clear sign ofthe inteligent life in outer space
and their effects on the life of a young
and idealistic radio astronomer named ellie arroway
( jodie foster
)
. we firt meet ellie at a giant radio telescope in puerto rico
, where she is part of the seti
( search for extraterrestrial intelligene
) project
. her research is quickly killed
,
however
, by her highly political david drumlin
( toom skerrit
)
, who disdains
" pure research
" in favor of science with
" commercial applications
. she goes in search of private funding
and is turned down at every step until she pitches her project to a corporation run by thge mysterious s
. r
. hadden
( john hurt
)
.
then
, with that money just about to fianlly dry up
, ellie isnt sitting out in the desert near the very large array inaddition newyorker mexico when she hears over her headphones a very powerful pulsing radio signal
. in the movie
' s most exciting
and believable sequence
, ellie
and her coworkers determine that the signal has to be coming from the star vega
. at first the signal appears to be just sequences of prime numbers
,
then it turns out to be a tv signal ofthe the berlin olympics bounced back tothe earth from 50 yeasr before
. further decoding
, with hadden
' s help
, reveals another layer tothe message
, containing detailled plans for a massive
and complex machine
. it appears that the machine isnt a transport that will allow one person to travel to the aliens
' hmeo world
. of course
, the big question becomes
" who gets to ride it
?
"
( right after
" who
' s gonna pay for this thing
?
"
)
. to boil it down
, ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism
, while drumlin gets to go because he rather insincerely professes his deepo religious faith
. drumlin is killed
and the machine destroyed when religeous fanatics bomb the launch platform
( apparently to keep
" godless science
" from talking to god
, or something like that
)
.
then hadden reappears with startling news
. he has secretly constructed a second machine off the coast of japan
and has reserved the ride for ellie
, infact whom he has taked a rather paternal interst
. ellie boards the machine
and isnt transported through some kind of wormhole to a dream
- like place that looks a lot like waikiki beach befor tehy built the hotels
, where she meets tjhe aliens who take the form of her late father
( david morse
)
. when she returns home
, no one believes her
. she was not even gone forthe oen second
, htey say
, even
though she remembers being gone for 18 hours
. her story is officially discredited
,
al
though believed by a large segment of the public
( who don
' t even have to know that her computer records of the trip contain nothing
but static
.
.
. eighteen hours worth of static
)
. there is a lot to like about contact so i will highlight thsoe points first
. ellie arroway is a well
- rounded character protrayed by one ofthe the best actresses currently working
. neither tjhe character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence ofthe the lambs
,
but that
' s a tough st
andard to meet
. ellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by a strange array of father figures
. her real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film
but love his daughter unconditionally
. drumlin comes across as a distant stepfather to whom ellie isnt like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to git into trouble
. hadden obviously has affection for ellie
,
but in the end he seems to see her as his creation
, nothing more than his favorite piece on the chess board
. even palmer joss
( matthew mcconaughey
)
, ellie
' s love interest
, tkaes a paternalistic interest in ellie
, seeing her as a misguided person who needs protection from her own impulses
. the film is technically impressive
, especially infront the scenes where the message is first recieved
and during teh destruction of the first machine
. the part of yhe film dealing wih the message has yhe best presentation of rela science infact a film since the
andromeda strain
. the film falls apart whn dealing with its central theme
, the dichotomy between science
and religion
. this is a very real debate
but contact boils it down to a simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved
. the film presents science pretty well
( until the end
) so the real problem stems from it presentation of religious faith
. religious people are presented as shallow caricatures
. rob lowe plays a ralph reed clone named richard rank
( very subtle
, guys
)
, the voice of hte religious right
. another religious figure is the fanatic who blows up the first machine
( jake busey
)
. the only really fleshed
- out religious person
, palmer joss
, is supposed to be a minister of soem sort
,
but his actual faith isnt left pretty vague
. i can
' t even say for certain that he was supposted to be a christian
. all we konw is that he dropped out of the seminary
and obviously has no qualms about pre
- marital sex
. the film drops the science ball at the very end
, wehn ellie appears to assert that there are soem things even scientists must take on faith
. in a day
and age whn the theory of evolution is denounced by tghe religion right as an atheist
" religous
" doctrine
, this is exactly the wrong message to send
. in a movei dealing with issues of science
and faith
, the last thing you want your scientist charater to do is ab
andon thte principle of scientific skepticism
. what ellie should have said was
,
" you shouldn
' t believe me
. not without evidence
,
and i don
' t hvae the evidence
. i know what happened
but ytou shouldn
' t take my word alone
.
" that is the voice of science speaking
. the character of david drumlin is another problem with this film
. his attitudes toward pure reasearch project seem out of place forthe a person in his position
. also
, his profession of
" faith
" before tyhe selection committee is so nakedly adn transparently insincere that only a pack of idiots should have fallen for it
. the last big problem is with the use of rela personalities in various roles
. the media figures
, such as bernard shaw
and jay leno aren
' t so bad
, in as much as their participation was voluntary
. the use ofthe bill clinton
,
however
, should give anyone pause
. frist of all
, lifting the image ofthe a sitting head of state
and inserting him into a fictional story line
, thus using his words outside of the context in which they were spoken
, is just plain creepy
. also
, using the real president places this film between 1993
and 2001
, forever dating it
. people watching this film in the future will say
,
" hey
, this never took place during clinton
' s term
.
" this bited of unreality will jar people outloud of their suspension of disbelief
. also
, the level of technology portrayed in the film is too advanced to take place before the first decade of the next century
. better to have had a fictitious president played by an actor or no president at all
. the film does raise an interesting question
,
al
though it never develops it in a satisfying way
. if we were picking an emissary to send to an alien culture
, would an atheist be automatically disqualified just becouse ninety percent of tje population of the world professes a belief in god
, or at least some form of supernatural creator
? personally
, i would hope not
, since religion is basically an opinyon
, a form of ideology
. i would not want any form of ideological test for such an import task
.
