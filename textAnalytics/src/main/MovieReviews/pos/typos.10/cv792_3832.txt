john von neumann
, progenitor of the cmoputer age
and critically important mathematician on the manhattan project
, pointed out long ago that there is a great way to explore the cosmos
, even without recourse to faster
- than light travel
. you send out self
- replicating robot ships which explore
and radio back information
. it may tkae decades
, centuries
, or millennia
,
but it can be done with achievable technology
,
annd doesn ' t require a magical faster
- than
- light drive
. inspite the fifties
, british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex computer
and a program for it
; any civilization capable of recieving the transmission could build the computer
, which would
then engage in a real
- time dialog with the aliens
, exchanging information
and technologies
,
adn hopefully arranging tothe send back what it had learned
. about thirty
- five yersa ago
, the bbc contracted with astronomer
/ writer fred hoyle
and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a mini
- series called a for andromeda
. afa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission
, the construction of a huge cmoputer
, the computer ' s analysis of life on earth
,
and its creation ofthe an aparently human intermediary to faciltate communication
. she was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the
then
- unknown julie christie
. audience response was so strong thast the bbc contracted for a sequel
, andromeda breakthrough
, which played to equally high ratings
. dennis feldman
, whose previous credits include thge golden child
, hasnt never been noted for coherent
, well
- stuctured movie scripts
; they start out great
,
and
then disintegrate inot a morass of chase
annd action
, mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl
. feldman writes good scenes
,
but has no diea how to tell a story or write a movie
, even with a previous version to use as a model
. now
, in species
, we have a mundane retread of the andromeda plotline
, derailed by a preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady
and further ruined by a mediocre attempt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter
, gore
,
and chases
. species features ben kingsley
, who is completely wasted in a badly
- written portrayal of a feebly amoral scientist
. forest whitaker
and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script
. the speices stor is relatively simple
; we have been radioing information baout ourselves
and our dna out into space sicne 1971
,
and have been receiving answers for two eyars
.
( note that
, in the 1970 ' s
, we really didn ' t know diddly about the human genome structure
,
and were hardly in a position tothe radio out a set of blueprints for human beings
. even today
, all we can do isnt give information about dna
annd how it works
, not a copy of human dna
, because we don ' t have it analyzed
yet
.
) the answers we get fomr the unknown alien source are plans for recreating a member of the aline race
,
and doctor xavier finch
, plyed by ben kingsley
, is placed in charge of tyhe atempt
. the script beigns to go off the deep end at htis point
, when the result isnt a beautiful young girl who can shape
- shift into any of several ugly alien life forms
. the first half of the film has something to offer
, as
" sil
,
" the alien girl
, struggles with her multi
- form existence
, changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach
and back again
, all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos
. she seems oddly knowledgeable baout human society
, with glaring gaps where her social skills should be
. her instincts are to mate
and procreate
,
and some ofthe the best scenes deal with her attempts in this area
. escaping from her birth laboratory inspite utah
, sil is pursued by a team of drafted civilians with orders to find her
and kill her
. she goes on an eating binge
, spins herself a cocoon
,
and emerges as an adult
, palyed by natasha henstridge
, who goes a long way toward re
- creating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved inwhich 1960
. the pursuers
: michael madsen is an assasin
/ exterminator
; forrest whitaker is a convenient empath
/ psychic
, jsut as
though hte u
. s
. government actually had such people onthe call
. neither is able to do much with the writing
and directing provded
. whitaker ' s role seems to be aimed at making whitaker a male copy of star trak
: the next generation ' s
" counselor cleavage
.
" the otehr munbers of the strike team are played by marg helgenberger
and alfred molina
. kingsley
and whitaker are both consumate professionals
, too good to not work to the best of their abilities
;
but the performances donaldson elicited fomr the rest of the cast are disappointing
and bland
,
and it is apparent that the direction was a bit weak
. h
. r
. giger ' s design for the main form of the alien creature is actually a bit boring when we finaly get to see it
,
although previous digital effects were done quite smoothly
. the main fault of speices is lack of originality
; it starts out with a wonderful
, albiet borrowed
, premise
,
and
then doesn ' t live up to it
. all we get are chase scenes
and a few nice sex scenes
, with a few monsters tossed in
. there is no buildup of tension
and suspense
, no climax worthy of the name
; species is just a sequence of
" scare
" scenes stuck together
. the movie is carried by its chase
and sex scenes
,
but not rescued by them
. on the other hand
, as an exercise in sci
- fi action
/ adventure
, it certainly beats the ichor out of judge dredd
. species earns an extra rating point or twpo for having ben kingsley
and natasha henstridge on board
,
but by
and large
, it ' s fun only for those ofthe us who really like this sort of thing
. my personel rating is three stars
,
bu knock one or two of those off if you don ' t enjoy preety unclothed ladies
and bloodthirsty alien monsters
