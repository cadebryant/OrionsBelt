not too many people know who james whale is
,
but it
' s a safe bet thgat a good chunk of them hve seen his movies
. if we are to believe thge semi
- biographical gods
and monsters
, whale would have wanted it to be that way
. this is an insightful
, haunting exploration of the last days of the frankenstein
and bride of frankenstein director
,
and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in a hollywood movie
. gods
and monsters has no interest in being a biopic of whale
' s life because it tracks onyl thge final fewd days of his life
,
and it
' s probably a better movei for it
. it
' s focus is on whale
' s
( ian mckellen
) untraditional
and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone
( brendan fraser
)
. it begins with whale
( a fairly talented artist
, aside from being a director
) asking boone to
" sit for him
,
"
( pose for a portrait
)
. at first
, boone doesn
' t realize that whale is gay
and grows fascinated with the ood man
. when he does discover whale
' s sexual orientation ffrom his dedicated
and protective maid
( lynn redgrave
)
, he is frightened
, refusing to sit for the guy
.
but he comes back
, only to storm out again
, disgusted with whale
' s
" locker room talk
.
" boone returns yot another time
, after whale promises to tone down the aforementioned
" locker room talk
,
"
and finds their platonic relationship to be strenghtening
. meanwhile
, jimmy hismelf is suffering from hallucinations
and mental attacks as a result of his stroke not long ago
. his ailment leads tothe desperation
and depression
, which build to the point where he is forced to ask boone for an incredulously big favor
. whta is perphas most sensational baout gods annd monsters is brendan fraser
' s bravura performance
; up untli seeing thsi film i intensely disliked the young actor because of his tendency to ruin the movies he is in
( blast from the past
, for exmaple
)
. i was surprised how expressive an actor he proved himself to be here
. this is impressive because his character
' s dialogue is minimal
, with mckellan doing most ofthe the talking
. that requires fraser to ect through body language
; a difficult skill to master
,
but something he proves capable of doing well
. this is not to ignore mckellan
' s oscar nominated turn
. he earned that nomination with his touching performance here
( altough
, at the risk of sounding like a philistine
, i would have chosen his performance as yhe nazi in apt pupil for the nomination
)
; an understated
, compelling gme
. whale dreaded being remembered solely for his work in the hollywood horror genre
, anbd he
thought hollywood tothe be the equivelent of a battlefield
. he rejoiced in being free from it
, only reluctantly going to receptions with fellow movie people
. in the end
, perhaps
, it is wqat killed him
: the memories of hollywood
and war blending together to form a living nightmare
