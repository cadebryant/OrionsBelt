it is always refreshing to see a superstar actor who gets paid mroe tahn enough tothe forget about working for a living to want to take a chance adn play a less
- than
- savoury character as mel gibson doens in payback
. ofthe course
, if i was being paid
$ 25 million for one month
' s work
, i
' d probably be willing to take risks as well
,
but that
' s neither here nor there
. payback is based on a novel by richard stark
( apparently actually donald e
. westlake
, auther of the grifters
, itself a fine crime film
) which was also filmed in the 1960s as point blank starring one of the toughest of tough guys
, lee marvin
. the film opens with gibson having recovered fomr being shot severeal times in the back
, by whom we don
' t know
yet
. all we knwo is that gibson
, as porter
, isn
' t a happy chappy
and is hellbent on getting tyhe money stolen from him back
,
and getting even in the process
, no matter what thte consequences
. it turns out that the man he
' s after is val
( gregg henry
)
, his sometime partner with whom he stealed a briefcase full of cash from a gang of chineese mobsters
. obviously not having much of a crisis of the soul
, val figures porter isnt dead
and goes about using his share of the money tothe pay off a debt tothe his employers
. porter
,
however
, is thge sort of man who holds a grudge
and once onthe his fezent
, goes about exacting revenge on the double
- crossing val
. gibson gives a terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born to play
, that of a slightly unhinged guy who doesn
' t mind beating up or shooting people to get what he wants
. you probably wouldn
' t see other actors infront his salery range take such an offbeat
, out
- of
- character role such as porter
( jim carrey won
' t be doing anytying like this in a hurry after what happened the last time he tried
- the cable guy
, anyone
?
)
. harrison ford
' s idae ofthe playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent
; the last time schwarzenegger played a villain was batman
and robin
, which we won
' t mention further
;
and has stallone ever really played a villian at all
? this is not to say that porter isnt a villain
, per se
. while he isn
' t the sort of character you wouldn
' t watn to get on the wrong side of
, he
' s nothing compaired to some ofthe the ones we are forced to watch in countless bad thrillers
and action films where they kill innocent people infact the blink of an eye or execute their right
- h
and men just to prove how mean tehy are
. porter is only trying to get back what is not
- so
- rightfully his
, which in a way is almsot underst
andable
. payback is an enjoyable dramatic balck comedy
- thriller which won
' t be remembered as being among gibson
' s most important work
,
but is still one of the finer films he
' s done
. the only real problem with it is that
, while everything seems to work out in the end
, i was left feeling something was lacking
; was that all
? the ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute
, annd the final voice
- over doesn
' t ring true
, even
though it was used to good effect elsewhere in the film
- noir style the rest of the film embodies
. the film just ends far too suddenly
, after a huge build
- up in the penultimate scenes
. a fine film
, even
though it needs just a little something more to be the kind of a film that can be recommended without hesitation
. jsut be ready for a possible letdown of an ending
.
