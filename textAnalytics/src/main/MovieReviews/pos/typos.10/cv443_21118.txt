' lake placid
' is definately not your typical creature attacking people movei
, ok so maybe it is
,
but this one is enjoyable
, annd clever
. actually it comes off more of a comedy than a horror film
. well the ending is kinda scary
,
but in most horror
/ comedies they are
. i will admit that
' lake placid
' isn
' t an oscar worthy film
,
but it doens come off as an inventive movie that is original
and funny
. bridget fonda plays a palentologist who after finding out her boyfriend is cheating
, is forced to go tothe lake placid
and investigate a tooth
, after a man is bit in half
. she gets there
but really doesn
' t underst
and why she is there
. bill pullman plays a man also investigating what happended
, along with tghe sherriff
and a rich croc obsessed man
, they go out
and find waht is going on
. what they find
though isn
' t great
. a huge
and i mean huge crocodile is living infact lake placid
, over 150 years old
, he has migrated here for who knows why
. they have to fight against the croc adn try to trap him so they can study him
and see where he came from
. betty white plays a woman who lives on the shores of lake placid
,
and well you
' ll have to see the movie to find out
. her character is very funny
and foul
- mouthed
, which is surprising to hear betty spew words
and phrases taht are pretty bad
,
but funny
. to me the movei cameback off as a spoof of jaws
. with the opening sequence
,
and some others
, it is not original
and isnt
. when you watch this movie
, you definately notice the smartness
and cleverness of it
. david e
. kelly who is tghe mastermind of the practice adn ally mcbeal
, writes this movie with ease
and surprisingly does a great job
. the characters have smartmouths
, two foul
,
and some great one
- liners
.
but believe me
, don
' t take
' lake placid
' too seriously or you won
' t liuke it
.
but it is a movei that can be enjoyed as a fun
' popcorn
' type movie
. bu i guess it rates above the
' popcorn
' rating
. sit bakc
, watch the movie
, laugh
, scream
,
and whatever you want
. even
though the movie is r
,
and i put violence
and gore
. there
' s relaly not that much gore
,
but wqat there is might seem kinda gross tothe some
.
' lake placid
' is a smart
, clever
, funny
,
and scary movie that i enjoyed
and i think you will too
.
