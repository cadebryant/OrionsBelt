truman
(
" true
- man
"
) burbank is thge perfect name for jim carrey
' s character infact this film
. president truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide
, inspite spite of
( or wass it because ofthe
) his stature
.
" truman
" also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war
, an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans
.
and burbank
, california
, brings to mind tjhe tonight show
and the hmeo of nbc
. if hollywood is the center of the film world
, burbank is
, or was
, the center of tv
' s world
, the world where our proatgonist lives
. combine all these names anbd concepts into
" truman burbank
,
"
and you get something that well describes him
and his artificial world
. truman leads the perfect life
. his town
, his car
,
and his wife are picture perfect
. his idae of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky
. the radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart
.
.
.
but
then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light
? the next day during the drive to work
, the radio jams
and he starts picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements
. he is so distracted thgat he nearly hits a pedestrian
. when the radio comes back to normal
, the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully
. his suspicion aroused
, he w
anders around the town square looking for other oddities
. the world appears tothe be functioning properly until he enters an office building
and tries to take the elevator
. the elevator doors open up onthe a small lounge with people on coffee breaks
. a grip sees truman him
and quickly moves a paneled door
, made to look like the back of an elevator
, into place
. two security guards grab him
and throw him out
. truman is really suspicious now
. it gets even worse the next day when his wife
, a nurse
, describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge
.
" it
' s best not to think baout it
,
" she says
, trying vainly to change truman
' s memory
. truman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense
. at every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town
. his last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean
and sail to the edge of the world
. you know by now that truman
' s life is thte subject of a television program
. his actions are
" real
"
but everything else is carefully scripted
, from the death of his father to the choice of his wife
. truman is determined to find out what the big hoax is
. meanwhile
, christof
, the all
- seeing creator of truman
' s world does his best tothe keep him unaware
and happy
. it
' s sort of like westworld told fomr the robots
' point of view
, or jurassic park from the dinosaurs
' point of view
. we root for the captive of the cage
- world
. our protagonist is counting on
" chaos theery
" to help him escape his elaborate trap
. the story
, written by
andrew niccol
( writer
/ director of gattaca
)
, introduces some interesting questions
, such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life
, or the psychological impact ofthe learning that your entire life has all been fake
.
al
though these questions came tothe mind
, i don
' t think the film itself asked them
. it certainly didn
' t addres them or try to answer them
. i was particularly disappointed that the film didn
' t deal more with the trauma of learning one
' s life is a tv sohw
. carrey
' s performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman
' s pain
,
but i almost felt that he got over it too easily fo the sake of the film
' s pacing
. earlier in the movei i found myself wondering if it would be better forthe truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him tothe be well
. the two seemed exclusive of one another
,
but weir
and niccol didn
' t see it that way
. perhasp it
' s not fair to criticize a movei for what it isn
' t
,
but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here
. bu on its own terms
, the movie is well made
. sighth
, sound
and pacing are all h
andled competently
. much of the first part of tje movei is the truman sohw
. the scenes are all apparently shot from hidden cameras
, with snoots
and obstructions covering the corners of the screen
. one hidden camera is apparently in his car radio
, the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen
. the music is well
- chosen
and scored
. the film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music
, when truman
' s world is still beautiful
and perfect
. when the movie ends
, the score soudns moreso like a frantic
, driven
, tangerine dream opus
, while still keeping the smae timbre
. philip glass
' epic music
( from powaqqatsi
) permeates truman
' s scenes of suspicion
and awakening
.
( glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show
.
)
and tjhe pacing ofthe the story was brisk
. there ws noone unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show
, just a few quick title cards
, a few interviews
, anbd
then right inot the show
, annd the movie
. one of the first scenes is of yhe studio light falling
; there was no token scene of truman
' s idyllic life before it falls apart
, because it wasn
' t necessary
, we pick up the tsory at the first sign ofthe trouble
,
and no sooner
. there
' s also no point in the movie where the plot slows down
. it
' s a quick
, straight shooted to the movie
' s end
. in terms of overall quality
, i would compare the truman show to niccol
' s gattaca
. both films are well made whith interesting stories set in intresting worlds
. bu neither film really felt like it capitalized onthe all the great ideas
; neither film
" clicked
"
and became an instant classic
. neverthless
, i look forward to niccol
' s next film
, whatever it may be
.
