i don
' t box with kid gloves
. i don
' t play nice
, i
' m nto a nice guy
,
and i never
, ever
, go easy on a film
. i consider it to be a breech of some sort ofthe code of ethics for a movie critic
.
however
, i do some favors
,
and these often come in the form of points that i h
and to certain groups due to the artistic bravery
. rigormortis
, the production company that has been my prime example of how money does nto need to motivate filmmaking
, gets several of theese points each time
. i still
,
however
, will not go easy onthe them
. they recently sent me a vhs copy of theri down with america trilogy
( hwihc begins
, quite wittily
, with a disclaimer that they are nto trying to undermine america whith the making of tihs film
.
)
and i decided to spend an hour ofthe my day watching it
. in the famous lines of many martyrs
, i have no regrets
. well
, i dont have some regrets
,
but that is not the point in the previous sentence
. thte point of it was that down with america was a film that
, ffrom a critical st
andpoint
, did not entirely disappoint me
. sure
, teh risky use of vhs instead of super 8mm or 16mm was a pain
,
and the natural light was one of the most annoying thigns baout public access films
,
but the movie itself was fairly enjoyable
. down with america concerns a government agent
, needless murder
,
and a book containing everything from the unabomber
' s manifesto to the 1995 apple computer profit report
. like the previous films of rigormortis that i have reviewed
, it displays an off
- kilter humer anbd intelligence
? it succeds in making me laugh where countless studio films fail
. the best way to see tihs film would be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of the 80s
. a dying movement from thge day they started
, these paranoid
` thrillers
' had the government always covering up something
and had the same favorite word
:
` roswell
.
' in down with america
, tjhe line
` roswell
' is highly absent
. witht an about ten minute running time
, down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich
? thta the conspiracy films fell into
, makes jokes at them at the same time
,
and provides us with funny
and memorable characters
. again
, i have seen movies that have gone on two hours wiht characters i couldn
' t care less about
. the film
, as previously stated
, concerns a federal agent
( peter roach
)
, an obsessed librarian
( meri stevens
)
, a mystery man
( joe kaczkowski
)
,
and two people obsessed with silence in the library
( robb sherman
, kevin flowers
)
. the plot
: a book containing the secrets of all anarchists is hidden in
? a public library where it cin be viewed by all
. fomr there we go into a delightful parody
. the federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth
, the librarian goes onthe a diatribe about thge sanctity of books
. we spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes thyat are performed much too well considering the lack of coaching of the cast
.
al
though the actors
and actresses are iin small roles
and give a whole new meaning to
` no
- name
'
, it ends up being the no
- name people who do a good job
, delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns outloud
. for once
, i don
' t have a url that i know offh
and to give you as to where to locate the film online
. i can only say that you should find my previous reviews of l
' auto
and les x
- files
and look up the rigormortis productions site in
and of itself
. it
' s almsot as much fun as the film
.
