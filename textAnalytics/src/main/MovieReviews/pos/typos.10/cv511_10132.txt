i
' m an avid fan of the
" alien
" saga
, so this review is obviously a tad biased
( at least i admitted it
)
. ofthe course
, that doesn
' t mean that i
' m gonna be giving this a four
- star review or something
, because
" alien
: resurrection
,
" tje fouth film in the cool
- as
- hell series is not an absolutly amazing film
, much like the first two were
.
however
, it
' s a very good film which never fails to entertain
,
and consists of
yet another mutation in the style of the series
. in short
, i had a good time
.
" alien
: resurrection
" leaves off 200 years after the last one
, where our heroine protagonist
, ellen ripley
( sigourney weaver
)
, the science fiction genre
' s answer tothe job
, had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body
, waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one
. of course
, the last one wasn
' t very great or anytying
( i liked it
,
though nto as much as the first two
)
,
and omre importantly
, it wasn
' t financialy successful
( a tawdry 55 million bucks
!
)
. so back we are
, with ripley back as a clone
, which means we get another little satirical look at cloning
( not that that
' s a bad thing
,
but it
' s becomming a cliche
)
. so she
' s cloned aboard an even more futuristic
- looking ship called
" the auriga
" by some doctors
( including the necessary bad government guy
, dr
. wren
, played by j
. e
. freeman
, as well as the little
- seen dr
. gediman
, played by none otehr than brad douriff
)
, mainly because they have a version of her withthe the alien still inside her
. once yuo get past thte fact that you can
' t figure out where htey got her blood
( altough i think it might ahve been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one
)
, the film
' s okay
. also on board are a b
and of mercenary pirates
, including michael wincott
, ron perlman
, kim flowers
, raymond cruz
, dominique pinon
( a jeunet sytable
)
and
.
.
. winona ryder
, who plays analee call
, who turns out to have a bit of a secret
( i won
' t state it
,
but unless you
' ve been shacking up with salinger for yhe past two years
, you probably know all about it
-
al
though it
' s nicely covered up
)
. there
' s a bit of a non
- sexual
-
yet
- slightly
- homoerotic relationship between her
and ripley
,
but it
' s never really deepened enough
. oh well
. well
, as you might have guessed
, the alien annd its spawn escape
and run around the ship
.
and it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship
( including some shocks
- dan hedaya
, forthe instance
, who
' s death is comical
yet sad since
, well
, he
' s dan hedaya
)
,
and the remaining people
( about 7 or 8
) are left to try
and excape adn stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towords earth
. of course
, tyhe plot is all balderdash
,
and just an excuse for some good ood
" alien
"
- br
and fun
. the real focus of the series seems to be on sytle
, not really substace
(
al
though there
' s always a bit ofthe it
, most notabley in
" aliens
" with tjhe relationship between ripley
and the little girl
)
. what
' s interesting about hte series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach
.
" alien
" is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights
.
" aliens
" isnt a wild
, tense thriller
.
" alien 3
" is a bleak
, moody peice of semi
- noir
.
" alien 4
" is kind of like an off
- beat french film
, filled with lots of humor
,
and cool scares
. jean
- pierre jeunet
( without his usual directing partner
, marc caro
) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like
" das boot
" has
, with echoes hinting at a possibile threat
. the chills in tyhe film are really cool
, especially wih the music
, whic is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes
( there
' s the most tense surgery scene since
" face
/ off
" towards the beginning
)
.
and not every chill turns inot a bloody mess or anything like thgat
. this all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually
and stylistically as the others
. there are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly excecuted
. one is the aforementioned surgery scene
. another one takes place between call
and ripley
, which is just awesome
. the underwater chase scene
and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense
, thrilling
,
and jaw
- dropping scenes in the entire saga
( with a small allusion to jeunet
' s earlier film
,
" delicatessen
"
)
.
and the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool
( with a lovley allusion to
" goldfinger
"
)
.
but the best scene in the entire film
( i
' m sure i
' m not thte first to mention it
) takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her
( she has a an
" 8
" tatooed on her arm
)
. it might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga
. tjhe screenplay by joss whedon is not a gerat piece of work
, as it never really deapens a lot ofthe the characters
. howver
, it does make us care about most ofthe them
, so that when there
' s very littel of them
,
and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow
, we are pretty scared
.
and
, yeah
, there are some very funny lines
( ripley
:
" who do i have to fuck to get off this boat
?
!
" johner
:
" well
, i can get ytou off
.
but not this ship
.
"
) the acting is good all around
, with st
and
- out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner
,
and lel
and orser
( the poor bastad in
" se7en
" who performes the
" lust
" sin
) as an anxiety
- ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him
. winona ryder is good
,
but not amazing like she usually is
(
al
though she meshes well with the film
)
. of course
,
and as usual
, sigourney weaver steals the show
. playing a variation onthe the ripley character
( less emotional
,
and more rude
and bitter
)
, she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable
. she
' s nto going tothe get an oscar nomination like she did for
" aliens
,
"
but she
' s just awesome
. overall
, it
' s a thrilling
, entertaining film which doesn
' t really amaze like the first two
,
but is much more amazing than the third installment
. the style is the best part of the film
, which isn
' t raelly a bad thing
,
but it being the best part takes awya from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply
.
but it
' s entertaining as hell
,
and it
' s definitely fit for tjhe
" alien
" series
.
