i ' m an avid fan of the
" aline
" saga
, so this review is obviously a tad biased
( at least i admitted it
)
. of course
, that doesn ' t mean that i ' m gonna be giving this a four
- star review or something
, because
" alien
: resurrection
,
" the fourth film in the cool
- as
- hell series is not an absolutely amazing film
, much like the first two were
.
however
, it ' s a very ogod film which never fails to entertain
,
and consists of
yet another mutation in the style of the series
. in short
, i had a ogod tiome
.
" alien
: resurrection
" leaves off 200 years affter the last one
, where our heroine protagonist
, ellen ripley
( sigourney weaver
)
, the sceince fiction genre ' s answer to job
, had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body
, waiting to pop outloud like it did to john hurt in the first one
. of course
, the last one wasn ' t very great or anything
( i liekd it
,
though not as much as the first two
)
,
and more importantly
, it wasn ' t financialy successful
( a tawdry 55 million bucks
!
)
. so back we are
, with ripley back as a clone
, which means we get another little satirical look at cloning
( not that that ' s a bad thing
,
but it ' s becoming a cliche
)
. so she ' s cloned aboard an even more futuristic
- looking ship called
" the auriga
" by some doctors
( including the necessary bad government guy
, dr
. wren
, played by j
. e
. freeman
, as well as the little
- seen dr
. gediman
, played by none other than brad douriff
)
, mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her
. once you get past the fact that you can ' t figure out where they got her blood
(
although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one
)
, the film ' s okay
. also on board are a band of mercenary pirates
, including michael wincott
, ron perlman
, kim flowers
, raymond cruz
, dominique pinon
( a jeunet sytable
)
and
.
.
. winona ryder
, who plays analee call
, who turns out to have a bited of a secret
( i won ' t state it
,
but unless you ' ve been shacking up with salinger for the past two years
, you probably know all about it
-
although it ' s nicely covered up
)
. there ' s a bit of a non
- sexual
-
yet
- slightly
- homoerotic relationship between her
and ripley
,
but it ' s never really deepened enough
. oh well
. well
, as you might have guessed
, the alien
and its spawn escape
and run arround teh ship
.
and it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship
( including some shocks
- dan hedaya
, for instatance
, who ' s death isnt comical
yet sad usance
, well
, he ' s dan hedaya
)
,
and the remaining people
( about 7 or 8
) are left tothe try
and escape
and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth
. of course
, hte plot is all balderdash
,
and just an excuse forthe some good old
" alien
"
- brand fun
. the real focus of the series seems to be on style
, not really substance
(
although there ' s allways a bit of it
, most notably in
" aliens
" with the relationship between ripley
and the little girl
)
. what ' s intresting about hte series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach
.
" alien
" is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights
.
" aliens
" is a wild
, tense thriller
.
" alien 3
" is a bleak
, moody peice of semi
- noir
.
" alien 4
" is kind of like an off
- beat french film
, filled with lots of humor
,
and cool scares
. jean
- pierre jeunet
( without his usual directing partner
, marc caro
) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like
" das boot
" has
, with echoes hinting at a possible threath
. the chills in the film are really kool
, especially with the music
, whic isnt sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes
( there ' s the most tense surgery scene since
" face
/ off
" towards the beginning
)
.
and not every chill turns inot a bloody mess or anything like that
. this all combined wih some good old humor makes this as interesting visually
and stylistically as the others
. there are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed
. one is the aforementioned surgery scene
. anohter one takes place between call
and ripley
, which is just awesome
. tjhe underwater chase scene
and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense
, thrilling
,
and jaw
- dropping scenes in tyhe entire saga
( with a small allusion to jeunet ' s earlier film
,
" delicatessen
"
)
.
and the way they dont in the fianl alien is hysterically cool
( with a lovely allusion to
" goldfinger
"
)
.
but thte best scene in the entire film
( i ' m sure i ' m not the first to mention it
) takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her
( she hasnt a an
" 8
" tatooed on her arm
)
. it might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga
. the screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work
, as it never realy deapens a lot of the characters
.
however
, it does make us care about most of them
, so that when there ' s very littel of them
,
and it looks like one or moreso of them may become alien chow
, we are pretty scared
.
and
, yeah
, there are some very funny lines
( ripley
:
" who do i have to fuck to get off this boat
?
!
" johner
:
" well
, i can git you off
.
but not this ship
.
"
) the acting is good all around
, with stand
- out performances fomr ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner
,
and leland orser
( the poor bastad in
" se7en
" who performed the
" lust
" sin
) as an anxiety
- ridden wannabe woody allen who has an aline inside him
. winona ryder is ogod
,
but not amazing like she ususally is
(
altough she meshes well with the film
)
. ofthe course
,
and as usual
, sigourney weaver steals the show
. playing a variation onthe the ripley charater
( less emotional
,
and more rude
and bitter
)
, she pulls it off while still bieng utterly lovable
. she ' s not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for
" aliens
,
"
but she ' s just awsome
. overall
, it ' s a thrilling
, entertaining film which doesn ' t relaly amaze like the first two
,
but is much more amazing than yhe third installment
. the style is the best part of the film
, which isn ' t realy a bad thing
,
but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply
.
but it ' s entertaining as hell
,
and it ' s definitely fit for the
" alien
" series
.
