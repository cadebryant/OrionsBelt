it
' s hard nto to recommend
" the others
.
" the supernatural thriller
, written
and directed by alej
andro amen
? bar
(
" open your eyes
"
)
, adroitly establishes
and maintains a low
- key atmosphere of menace
. the cinematography
, by javier aguirresarobe
, is as ogod as i have ever seen
and nicole kidman gives another in her growing body of fine performances
.
but the pacing of the story moves from deliberate to downright sluggish
and the payoff ofthe the tale left me less than satisfied
. overall
, teh film plays like a very high quality version ofthe any number of old
" twilight zone
" episodes where the characters spend a grat deel of time w
andering about looking afraid
and disoriented
, only tothe learn they are actually a child
' s toy
, a military test subject or a department store dummy
. watching those vintage shows
and listening to the players chatter
, i always wanted to shout
,
" git on witht it
!
" as much as i appreciated the atmosphere
and acting in
" the others
,
" my reaction was much the smae
. set at an isl
and mansion off the caost ofthe engl
and during world war ii
, the story focuses on grace
( kidman
)
, who tends to her children anne
( alakina mann
) annd nicholas
( james bentley
)
and worries about her husb
and
, charles
( christopher eccleston
)
, a missing serviceman
. anne
and nicholas suffer from photosensitivity
and grace patrols the estate with the keys tothe all 50 doors
, protecting the little ones from excess light by making sure thyat only one door is open at a time
. at the beginning of the film
, three servants
, mrs
. mills
( fionnula flanagan
)
, young
, mute lydia
( elaine cassidy
)
,
and mr
. tuttle
( eric sykes
)
, an aging gardener
, join the family
. the two that speak seem agreeable enough at first
,
but it soon becomes apparent thgat they know something that grace doesnt not
. tothe make matters worse
, the children are upset
: nicholas is unusualy jittery
and anne claims to be seeing ghosts
. grace attempts to blame the toubles on the new arrivals to her home
, only to realize that whatever is hapening is beyond them
. that
' s essentially the whole story
, with the tension growing until tghe pivotal moment when everything becomes clear
. earlier
, there is an outst
anding scene where grace darts outside
, only to be enveloped in fold after fold of shimmering fog
. the visuals in the otherworldly sequence
, courtesy of aguirresarobe
, are simply astounding
. i also enjoied the presence of religion
, a rarity in films dealing with the supernatural
. grace is a christian
and answers her children
' s questions about life
and death with the assurance of a devout worshiper
. when mother is away
,
though
, the kids speculate whether her statements are fact or folklore
, jsut as real children do
.
but those nice touches fail to enliven a film that is too slow or make up for a lackluster endig
.
" thte others
" sets out to be a classic ghost story
,
but fails to grasp thyat special something that makes such films more than layers of mist
.
