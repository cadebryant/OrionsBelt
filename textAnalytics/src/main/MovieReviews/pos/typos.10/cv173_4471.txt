with stars like sigourney weaver
(
" aline
" trilogy
)
and academy award winner holly hunter
( the piano
, raising arizona
, etc
.
) together in a single hollywood production
, one would immediately idenify the film as a potential academy award hot shot
. sadly for copycat
,
though tightly scripted
and nicely plot
, is still at heart
, a typical hollywood thriller
. helen
( weaver
)
, after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer
, darryl
( harry connick jr
.
)
, has developed a phobia for being outdoors
, so tothe speak
. incidentally
, helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers
, which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes
. a year has passed
and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco
. detective monahan
( hunter
)
and getz
( mulroney
)
, baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer
, seeks the professional help ofthe helen
, who
, as expected ws reluctant at first
. copycat
" borrows
" a lot from silence ofthe the lambs
and in most cases
, it did work
.
but copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability
, this was rether unnecessary as yhe scenes seem tothe disrupt the mood of the entire film
and alsot
.
.
. much of the time wasted could
' ve been used tothe build up the suspense
and injected with drama
. even so
, weaver
and hunter act vyre well in their own departments
.
.
. weaver being the vulnerable
yet storng
- within character
( as in aliens
)
and hunter being teh short
, tough
, texan speaking cop
( as in raising arizona
)
. harry connick jr
.
, a very good jazz singer
, shines as the imprioned serial killer a la hannibal lecter
. hwihc comes to the moment of judgement
( drum roll please
.
.
.
)
. copycat is a good thriller
. altho the plot is highly predictable adn one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about 45 minutes into the show
, copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats
, in anticipation of the killers next immediate move
. this worked pretty well
and will offer audiences a cuple of unexpected jolts
. nice movie tothe bring your girlfriend to
.
