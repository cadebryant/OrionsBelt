you don ' t wanna to be like mike
. mike has beeen doing badly
. embarrassingly bad
. he baroke up a six
- year relatiopnship six months ago to move from n
. y
. to l
. a
.
and he ' s still not over her
. as a result
, his jokes fall flat when he tries to imbaress
,
and he ' s a comedian
. well
, an unemployed comedian
, oen of hollywood ' s littel fish
,
and it has gotten so bad he ' s asked for an application at starbuck ' s
. actually
, the starbuck ' s thing gets even worse
.
and worse
. you won ' t fail to like mike
,
however
, played endearingly by jon favreau
. swingers revolves around mike ' s half
- hearted
and awkward efforts to get bcak in the social swing of things
. to this end he is enthusiastically assisted by his equally underachieving twentysomething actor friends
, such as trent
( vince vaughn with the film ' s most animated performance
)
, who has the gift of gab bordering on the disturbing side of motivational speaking
, gun
- toting sue
( patrick van horn
)
,
and rob
( ron livingston
)
, who once played hamlet
but now longs to work as goofy in disneyland
,
but doesn ' t succeed because of his lack of
" theme park experience
.
" together they talk about women
- how to amke eye contact
, which involves avoiding it
,
and when to call so as never to apeared desperate
, two days being
" industry standard
.
" after talking the talk
, they walk the walk
, strutting like the cool swingers tehy aspire to be
, always to laughable effect
. tothe get mike out of his funk
, his friends persistently convince him to get outside
, whther it be to a quickie night trip to a seedy vegas casino or a cutthroat hollywood party with the beautiful people or a 50s swing lounge
. everywhere they encourage mike to look for a replacement
" honey
"
and
then keep vigil over his progress
, or lack of it
. like dotty doting parents
, mike never leaves thier company without being tje recipient of their confidence cheerleading
(
" you ' re mone
, mike
,
and the honeys know it
.
"
) or equipped with their eccentric dating philosophies
, such as an analogy of flirting with the bear
anbd the bunny
. with the unwavering support ofthe friends like these
, maybe mike ' s not doing too badly after all
. favreau also doubled as the film ' s screenwriter
,
and he proves he has the gift for creating engaging characters
adn witty banter that goes beyond today ' s bon mot
. there is a reassuring honesty to the friendships
, even whn it hits its low points
adn the friends commiserate
. when mike gets the gumption to look for love
, you will join his cheerleading section as well
. swingers is light
, unassuming fare
, sweet candy you will want to bust your gut with
- laughing
- again
and again
.
