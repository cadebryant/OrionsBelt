you don
' t want to be like mike
. mike has been doing badly
. embarrassingly bad
. he broke up a six
- year relationship six months ago to move from n
. y
. tothe l
. a
.
and he
' s still not over her
. as a result
, his jokes fall flat when he tries to impress
,
and he
' s a comedian
. well
, an unemployed comedian
, one of hollywood
' s little fish
,
and it has gotten so bad he
' s asked for an application at starbuck
' s
. actually
, the starbuck
' s thing gets even worse
.
and worse
. you won
' t fail to like mike
, howver
, played endearingly by jon favreau
. swingers revolves around mike
' s half
- hearted
and awkward efforts to git back in the social swing of thnigs
. to this end he is enthusiastically assisted by his equally underachieving twentysomething actor friends
, such as trent
( vince vaughn with the film
' s most animated performance
)
, who has the gift of gab bordering on the disturbing side of motivational speaking
, gun
- toting sue
( patrick van horn
)
,
and rob
( ron livingston
)
, who once played hamlet
but now longs to work as goofy in disneyl
and
,
but doesn
' t succeed because of his lack of
" theme park experience
.
" together they talk about women
- how to make eye contact
, which involves avoiding it
,
and when to call so as never to appear desperate
, two days being
" inudstry st
andard
.
" after tlaking teh talk
, they walk the walk
, strutting like the cool swingers they aspire to be
, always to laughable effect
. to get mike out of his funk
, his friends persistently convince him to get outside
, whether it be to a quickie night trip tothe a seedy vegas casino or a cutthroat hollywood party with the beautiful people or a 50s swing lounge
. everywhere they encourage mike to look for a replacement
" honey
"
and
then keep vigil over his progress
, or lack of it
. like dotty doting parents
, mike never leaves their company without being the recipiant of their confidence cheerleading
(
" you
' re money
, mike
, annd the honeys konw it
.
"
) or equipped with their eccentric dating philosophies
, such as an analogy of flirting with the bear
and the bunny
. with teh unwavering support of friends like these
, mabey mike
' s nto donig too badly aftter all
. favreau also doubled as the film
' s screenwriter
,
and he proves he has the gift forthe creating engaging characters
and witty banter that goes beyond today
' s bon mot
. there is a reassuring honesty to the friendships
, even when it hits its low points
and the friends commiserate
. when mike gets the gumption to look for love
, you will join his cheerleading section as well
. swingers is light
, unassuming fare
, sweet c
andy ytou will want to bust your gut with
- laughing
- agina
and again
