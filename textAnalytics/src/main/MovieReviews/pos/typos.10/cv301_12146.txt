the jekyll adn hyde stroy told from his maid
' s point of view is
, in a word
,
" dark
"
. you wouldn
' t expect something bright adn cheery based on robert louis stevenson
' s novel
,
but tghe film is surprisingly dreary
and dismal
. jekyll
/ hyde
( john malkovich
) is terminally depressed
and desperate
. mary reilly
( julia roberts
) is a victim of monstrous child abuse
and the anti
- woman sentiment of the times
. director stephen fears
' version ofthe the london slums makes us marvel thast anyone survived them
. the lighting level is exceedingly low throughout the movie
: it almost appears to be filmed inspite black
and white
. the direction adn cinematography are brilliant annd liquid
. scenes flow into the next scene like honey oozing off a strawberry
.
( except there
' s no red
, of course
.
) the look is so moody anbd melodramatic that you
' ll be shocked when you leave the theater
. i saw it at a matinee
and took quite a hwile to adjust tothe yhe sunny skies afterward
. often the jekyll
and hyde archetypes are viewed as splitting a whole person into components of good
and evil or perhaps cerebral
and emotional parts
. here the doctor is intellectual
and perhaps good
,
but certainly powerless
. his alter ego is forceful
and totally without conscience
. two parts that make up a whole
. neither are capable ofthe functioning without the other
and once seperated
, disaster is inevitable
. the differences between the two characters would be more effective if it were accomplished by demeanor
and attitude
. when we finally see the transformation
, the special effects thrust the story into the relm of science fiction
, not the psychological horror that the tale dem
ands
. roberts
and malkovich are skillful in their roles
. both are suitably melancholy
, fitting in with the rest of the film
. the onyl flash ofthe life
and color comes from glenn close
(
and her lips
) as the madam of a whorehouse where hyde lives
,
and surprisingly
, jekyll apparently frequents
. life
and color maybe
,
but this is not close
' s best role
. she seems little more than a cardboard cutout character
. a beautiful film inaddition its own dreary way
. you
' ll appreciate the filmmaking craft
,
but don
' t expect to leave in an upbeat mood
.
