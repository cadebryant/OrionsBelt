at first glance
, three kings looks to be jstu another war movie
, the 90s version ofthe all those favourite war movies with names i cannot remember
. the 90s version
, it definitely is
, just another war movie
? not inwhich your dreams
! imagine pulp fiction approach to saving private ryan
, that
 s three kings for you
. believe it or not
, it bears the cool of tghe former
and the stark humane meaning of the latter
. the story brings us to the twilight of the gulf war
, with the allied troops victorious
. majpr archie gates
( clooney
) leads an enterprising bunch of grunts to a rather unorthodox post
- war looting spree
; the millions in gold bars secretly stowed away by saddam in a desolate village in the desert
. as the rest ofthe the troops are celebrating their victory
and getting ready tothe be shipped home
, this
` wild bunch
 goes awol on an armed hum
- vee
( the vehicle of choice ofthe the us army
)
. they soon find out that they have much resistence
, as they get tangled with the local rebellion against saddam
 s forces
. frequently switching their modes betwen looters
and robin hood
 s merry men
, tehy become consciously attacked by their own morals
. as the film beggins to roll
, it seemed to have a rather
` light
 mood to it
.
` special
 effects such as wehn gates describes to his men how a bullet can kill simply paves the way for a light
- hearted funny acation movie
. three kings is much smarter than that
. as tyhe conflict becomes more
and more complex
, the audeince will be trapped in a limbo
, trying to stay focussed on that ight
- mood
/ serious
- mood that the film seem to portray
. i personally found this analogous to the same feelings ofthe the main characters involved in the film
; trapped between their initial plan paved by greed
and their own sense ofthe humanity
. this simply made the entire experience of watching three kings truly brilliant
. action sequences are not shot as your old
- fashioned war films nor anything like steven spielberg
 s in
- your
- face war violence
. they are carefully built to ganerate tension with just the right tight close
- ups
and pauses
, right before the acation starts
. not john woo for sure
but more of sergio leone
 s spaghetti western style
( tons ofthe them starring clint eastwood
)
. gerat performances by clooney
and wahlberg
but the brilliance have to lie in the conception of htis film
; the screenwriter
and the director
. three kings ranks among the best films of the year
, well
, for me at least
. highly recommended
.
