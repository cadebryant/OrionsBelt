it shows that america remains ambivalent over the nature of its political system
. noone major surprise
, when j
. s
. mill in his victorian classic on liberty could not make uv his mind over liberal democracy either
. the americans are wrought by thge archetypal paradox under whcih they exist
, the supreme contradiction between the right of thge one
and the right of the majority
. small wonder that hollywood
' s most compelling movies have oft been on the struggle of the individual
- underdog against some larger collective oppressive
- wittness braveheart
, born on the fourth of july
, rocky
, first blood
, clear
and present danger
, jfk
, the list goes on
. there
' s little of tath in singapore
- we are barred access to playboy
and penthouse both on
and off line
,
though thte government
' s been long worried about the younger peple getting
" americanised
"
and advocating individual rights
and parliamentary opposition
. the people vs
. larry flynt locates the political debate within the greatest social taboo in america
- sex
. does pornography have a right to exist
and circulate
? larry flynt
, the publisher of hustler magazine
, thinks so
,
and obviously so too the u
. s
. congress which last month trew out a bill to curb pornography on tyhe net
.
but even with such actions
, americans remain undecided
. the oscars apparently shunned the movie because it was an embarrassing
and sensitive livewire
. whta htey have ignored is actually a great picture
. woody harrelson as the lead character reprises his role as a to
- hell
- withthe
- morality
, to
- hell
- with
- the
- law
,
and to
- hell
- with
- hte
- sytem anti
- christ that we last saw in natural born killers
. annd he is outrageous
and convincing as a nihilistic atheist who nonetheless loves his ex
- stripper wife dearly
. the latter is played with ab
andon
, conviction
and sensitivity all at once by courtney love
, who is the real star of the show
and really snubbed of an academy award best actress nomination
, if not of the award itself
. edward norton plays their jerky lawyer
. the relatiopnship between harrelson
and love brings out another great paradox
- superficially they are immoral outcasts who
' ve had it coming
; woody gets shot
and becomes paralysed from the waist down
,
and courtney dies of aids
. god
' s damnation
.
but in the powerful love they have for eahc other
, each st
anding by the other in turn
, the two leads highlight the question how much is the nihilist still a moralist
and
( in the american context
) a christian
, if they can loev
and care
,
and feel jsut like anyone esle on a personel level
. friedrich nietzsche once talked about how the atheist must uncover for himself the full consequences of athiesm by ridding himself of all moral
- christian influences
. to go beyond good
and evil
. this is a great picture
, no doubt
,
and i love it personally
. because it is moving
, funny
, ends with open american optomism blah blah
.
but i like it
and admire it because it comes from a fine american tradition that adres to raise difficult questions
,
and call into doubt ideas
and doctrines that otherwise are used as catchphrases
. there are times when movies go beyond thte stroy they tell adn reflect something of hidden realities
. this movie is not so much about larry flynt
,
but about americans
and american society
.
