field of dreams almost defies description
.
al
though it
' s about baseball
, it
' s not a baseball movie
.
al
though the film is extremely spiritual
, it
' s nto about religion
.
and
al
though field of dreams is melodramatic
, it
' s not a tearjerker
. to relaly underst
and what field of dreasm is all about
, you have to see it
. in the film
, kevin costner plays ravy kinsella
, a baseball fan
,
' 60s berkeley graduate
,
and iowa farmer
. one day as he is st
anding iin the middle ofthe his expansive corn fields
, ray hears a voice
; it tells him
:
" if you build it
, he will come
.
"
then ravy has a vision
and somehow concludes that if he builds a baseball field inaddition the middle of his corn
, shoeless joe jackson will arise from the dead to play ball once again
.
and even
though it depletes his family
' s savings
and his neighbors think he
' s crazy
, ray clears away the corn
and builds a baseball field
, complete with bleachers
and flood lights
.
" if you build it
, he will come
.
"
and lo
and behold
, shoeless joe doesnt come
-
- bringing with him several of his dead teammates
.
and
then ray hears the voice agina
; it tells him to
" ease his pain
.
" ray thinks this means that he must travel tothe boston to meet terence mann
, an influential
and radical novelist from the
' 60s who has sicne stopped writing
and dropped outloud of society
. with great aplomb
, james earl jones plays the disillusioned author who joins forces with ray
and embarks with him on a magical anbd spiritual journey
. the cast in field of dreams is excellent
, especially kevin costner in the lead role
. costner gives a quiet
, subtle
,
and moving performance as a man who before building the baseball field had done nothing crazy or spontaneous in his entire life
. costner gives ray just the right mix of enthusiasm
and idealism to make us believe in his mystic visions
and swallow this wondrous fairy tale
. amy madigan gives a fine supporting performance as ray
' s feisty
and loving wife
, who againnst her better judgement supports her husb
and
' s crazy ideas
. in her most impressive scene
, madigan vehemently argues against book burning at a p
. t
. a
. meeting
, displaying the sincere passion of a
' 60s berkeley radical
. ray liotta is appropriately eerie
and awe
- inspiring as the ghost of shoeless joe
, the legendary batter who was suspended from baseball for his involvement in the 1919 chicago
" black sox
" sc
andal
.
and finaly
, burt lancaster is memorable in a small
,
but important
, role as a small town doctor whose professional baseball career was limited to only one inning
. field of dreams is a touching fairy tale full of life
, wonder
, mystery
, spirit
,
and humor
. it
, for the most part
, succeeds in capturing our emotions
and suspending our disbelief
. ray kinsella
' s spiritual quest in persuit of his dreams proves to be moving
and miraculous
.
but hwile field of dreams generally avoids excessive melodrama
, it unfortunately doens at times go overboard
,
and by the end it gets down
- right sappy
. in general
, howver
, field ofthe dreasm is an emotionally satisfying fantasy
-
- one i can recommend to everyone
but unromantic cynics
.
