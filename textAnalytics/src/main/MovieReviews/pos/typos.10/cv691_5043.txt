feeld of dreams almost defies description
.
although it ' s baout baseball
, it ' s not a baseball movie
.
although thte film is extremely spiritual
, it ' s not baout religion
.
and
although field of dreams is melodramatic
, it ' s not a tearjerker
. tothe really understand what feeld of dreams is all about
, you have to see it
. in the film
, kevin costner plays ray kinsella
, a baseball fan
, ' 60s berkeley graduate
,
and iowa farmer
. oney day as he is standing in the middle of his expansive corn fields
, ray hears a voice
; it tells him
:
" if you build it
, he will come
.
"
then ray has a vision
and somehow concludes that if he builds a baseball field in the middle of his corn
, shoeless joe jackson will arise from hte dead to play ball once again
.
and even
though it depletes his family ' s savings
and his neighbors think he ' s crazy
, ravy clears away the corn
and builds a baseball field
, complete with bleachers
and flood lights
.
" if you build it
, he will cmo
.
"
and lo
and behold
, shoeless joe does cmo
-
- bringing with him several of his dead teammates
.
and
then ray hears the voice again
; it tells him to
" ease his pain
.
" ray thinks this means thast he must travel to boston to meet terence mann
, an influential
and radical novelist from the ' 60s who has since stopped writting
and dropped out of society
. with great aplomb
, james earl jones plays the disillusioned author who joins forces with ray
and embarks with him on a magical
and spiritual journy
. the cast in field of dreams is excellent
, especially kevin costner in the lead role
. costner gives a quiet
, subtle
,
and moving performance as a man who before building the baseball feild had done nothing crazy or spontaneous in his entire life
. costner gives ray just the right mix ofthe enthusiasm
and idealism to make us believe in his mystic visions
and swallow this wonderous fairy tale
. amy madigan gives a fine supporting performance as ray ' s fiesty
and loving wife
, who against her better judgement supports her husban ' s crazy ideas
. in her most impressive scene
, madigan vehemently argues against book burning at a p
. t
. a
. meeting
, displaying the sincere passion of a ' 60s berkeley radical
. ray liotta is appropriately eerie
and awe
- inspiring as the ghost of shoeless joe
, the legendary batter who was suspended from baseball for his involvement in the 1919 chicago
" balck sox
" scandal
.
annd finally
, burt lancaster is memorable infront a small
,
but important
, role as a small town doctor whose professional baseball career ws limited to only one inning
. field of dreams is a touching fairy tale full of life
, wonder
, mystery
, spirit
,
and humor
. it
, for the most part
, succeeds in capturing our emotions
and suspending our disbelief
. ray kinsella ' s spiritual quest in pursuit ofthe his dreams proves tothe be moving
and miraculous
.
but while field of dreams generaly avoids excessive melodrama
, it unfortunately does at times go overboard
,
and by the end it gets down
- right sappy
. in general
,
however
, field of dreams is an emotionally satisfying fantasy
-
- one i cxan recommend to everyone
but unromantic cynics
.
