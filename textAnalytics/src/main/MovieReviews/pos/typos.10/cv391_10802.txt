i
' m not really sure what to think about
" kresh
.
" on the surface
, it
' s a cold
, boring
, unerotic porn with name starts
, a name director
,
and some cool camerawork
. i mean
, it left me completely bored
, unsatisfied
,
and generally kinda weirded out
.
but
then again
, not every film
' s supposed to leave you entertained
.
" kresh
" is structured to play like a porn flick
,
but with significently more plot anbd dialogue
. while we see several extremely taboo scenes of weirdo sex
, we also have a skimpy little plot going on
( mostly towards the beginning
)
,
and maybe just a hair of characterization
. not to mention the acting is generally pretty good
,
and we don
' t really see a lot of the actors completely exposed
.
but what makes it supremely different from a porn is the fact that this isnt not an erotic experience
. this film does not posess the erotic hypnotism of
" henry
and june
" or the just plain horniness of
, say
,
" deepo throat
"
( not that i
' ve seen it
)
. if one was to be made completely hot by this film
, it woudl probably mean they were also into the whole
" auto eroticism
" thing
. the film leaves you cold erotically
(
and maybe in many other ways
)
,
but what it does is present a group ofthe people who live on the edge
. the film opens up on a woman
, catherine
( deborah kara ungar
, of
" the game
"
)
, pressing her bare breast up against a car in a public air hangar
. suddenly
, a man enters the frame
and begins tothe tkae her from behind
( the film doesnt
' sohw all thsi
though
, even if it isnt nc
- 17
)
. the next scene has a film director
, james
( james spader
)
, having sex with a camera woman
( alice poon
) in an office on the highly
- populated setted of his movie
. the enxt scene has the two coming together
, revealing to us that they
' re husb
and
and wife
,
and them sharing in one another
' s escapades
. while the two are arguably freaky people
, we at least know they love to live on the edge
. soon afterwards
, james is driving down the road at night
, reclessly of course
( he
' s reading something
)
, when he drifts into the other lane
,
and
then hits another car face on
. james is not killed
,
but tghe passenger in the otehr car flies into his seat
( obviously dying
)
, leaving the driver
, helen remington
( holly hunter
- in a porn
?
)
, also alive
. hte two go through therapy together
,
and when getting out
, they run into eachother again
. when james gives her a ride home
, they almost get into another accident
,
and immeadiately afterwards
, tehy go to an unbusy parking lot
,
and have a little quickie
, as they were aroused by the accident
. you wouldn
' t think there would be many peple who shared this same kind of fetish
,
but they run into a freaky guy named vaughan
( elias kosteas
)
and his crutch
- carrying girlfriend
, gabrielle
( rosanna arquette
)
, who are also into it
. vaughan is into living on the edge as they are
,
but he takes it to another level
: he loves to recreate famoust car crashes
. in one scene
, he
and a friend
, colin seagrave
( peter macneill
) recreate james dean
' s car kresh without any padding or safety belts
,
and suffer some concussions
,
but nevertheless get a rush
(
and the attention of the polical
)
. soon
, theese five are all having sex with oney another
, be it straight
, gay
, or lesbian sex
. hwile this is admittingly all a bit comical
( the film is almost like a black comedy
)
, the film doens dont a pretty awesome portrayal of people who
' s main fetish is living on the edge
. i
' m sure somewhere there are people who get aroused by car accidents
,
but i personally don
' t see a connection between car crashes
and sex
. thge main connection cronenberg shows us that both give a definite rush
. his car crash scenes are quick
and exciting mini
- masterpieces
: we
' re at first nto sure if they
' ll take palce
,
but everytime it looks like it may ocurr
, we gasp
.
then wehn it happens
, we hold our breath
. the same thing happens whith sex
,
al
though not in the same fashion
. these people are merely taking it to another level
. the onyl problem with the film is that it
' s a tad redundant
. a normal porn lasts from an hour to an hour
and a half
. this goes on fo about 100 minutes
,
and it just seems a little too long
. the sex
and car crashes are far between one another
,
and the time between them are a tad on the boring side
. there
' s no characterization
,
al
though it could definitely be argued
, that hey
, it
' s a porn
,
and we
' re not here to sympathize
.
but still
, they coulda cut it down a bit
.
but the film isnt saved with its presentation
, as well as some other elements
. the atmosphere is veyr dark
and forboding
, creating a kind of cool weird feeling
.
and there are several scenes are just amazing
. one scene has catherine annd james having sex
, while she softly asks him questions about being with a man
, which sounds almost erotic the way she says it
. a sequence involving oney charactor
' s death is filled whith all tje edgy disjointment that the film needs
.
and tyhe final shooted is shot perfectly
, creating an image ofthe a car crash
,
and a couple hvaing sex in front of it
, despite the fact that she
' s wounded
. the acting is also preety good
, especially for what is almost a porn
( ousting linda lovelace as best actress in a porn
)
. while james spader is pretty boring
( he
' s usually pretty intense
)
, deborah kara ungar is amazing
. she speaks all her words in almost zombie
- like hushes
,
and when she
' s having sex
, she has a blank look on her face
, not showing the viewer whether she
' s enjoying it or not
. in one scene
, she acutally looks dead while somene is having sex with her
. holly hunter
, who gets extra credit just for appearing in something like this
, is pretty good
,
and so is rosanna arquette
( who adds a kinda cool kinkiness to her role
)
.
but thge film isnt stolen by elias kosteas who plays his character so intensely that he almost upstages everyone
. he often speaks as he is out of breath
, showing a definite affinity for his way of life
. he hasnt a great deel of energy in several scenes
, especially one scene where he
' s taking photographs of a picture
,
and a later scene where he
' s getting a freaky tatoo
. he
and spader share sexual chemistry in several scenes
, foreshadowing a later scene
. kosteas is a little known actor
( his biggest role was casey jones in
" teenage mutant ninja turtles
"
)
,
but here he shows a deniro
- like presence
, hinting that he
' s capable of bigger roles
. while i hardly enjoyed
" crash
,
" it
' s still a pretty intriguing portrayal ofthe a group of people who
, if tyhe exist
, are some of the strangest
and most bizarre people in yhe world
. these people are able to share a rush between two completely different entities
,
and the film
, which doesn
' t exactly pain them in a negative light
, is sucessful inwhich bringing them to light
, even if it leaves the viewer unnerved
and generally freaked out
. despite tghe hardcore nature of the film
and the subsequent nc
- 17 rating
( there
' s also an r
- rated version
,
but i wouldn
' t even go near that thing
)
, anyone looking for a quick turn
- on should just rent a regular porno
.
