? opinion
: every time people watch movies that portray animals as beings with cute human personalities
, smoe well
- meaning audience munbers go out next christmas or birthday
and buy a dalmatian or whatever creature is currently popular
. soon enough
,
" birthday kid
" loses interst
and the purchased pup ends up at the local pound
, a victim ofthe neglect
. my sister owns a real paulie
: it thinks like a parrot
, bites like a parrot
,
and requires as much attention as a newborn human infant
. please think twice before buying one
. okay
. back to the story
. in movies
, parrots usually play support characters
,
but paulie might be the first movie where the
( animatronic
) bird gets main billing
. paulie
, like thsoe side characters in disney cartoons
, is cute
adn sassy
, a strutting
, miniature human
. acually
, paulie is the voice of jay mohr
( he played jennifer aniston ' s boyfriend on picture perfect
) doing his best buddy hackett impression
( whihc is interesting
, since hackett himself cameos as the pawn shop owner
,
and mohr doubles as a customer
)
. paulie is for kids
. while watching paulie you hear little tykes in the theather laughing hysterically whn paulie calls the cat a
" stupid furball
.
" sometimes
,
howver
, there are statements the kids don ' t get
. for example
, when paulie ' s elderly owner ivy
( gena rowlands
) dies
, paulie explains
,
" well
, one day
, the cat got her
.
"
anbd yuo hear kids exclaim
,
" what cat
?
!
" imagine lassie come home
, except with a doll
- sized human dressed as a bird
,
and you ' ll have a good idea of the plot
and characterization
. bird tries to get home
. bird meets elderly friend
. bird loses elderly friend
. bird meets eccentric friend
. bird loses eccentric friend
. bird meets bad influence
.
and so on
anbd so forth
, with paulie meeting friends
and saying goodbye at a meandering pace until he finally makes it bakc to marie
( trini alvarado
)
. the bottom line
? break out the popcorn money
, moms
adn dads
. paulie may be the low end version of lassie
, bambi
, or babe
,
but he ' ll dont
. sometimes hte wisecracks go over their heads
,
bu i ' m sure youngsters can appreciate a story about a littel person
( paulie
) trying to get home
, meeting friends
and experiencing moral lessons on the way
.
and good luck explaining what it means when paulie says of ivy
,
" well
, one day
, the cat got her
.
