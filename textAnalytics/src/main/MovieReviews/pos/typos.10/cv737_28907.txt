it isnt easy to see why the late stanley kubrick beleived steven spielberg would be the perfect director for his a
. i
. artificial intelligence
, just as it is underst
andable why spielberg was attracted to the material
. for here we have another lost boy trying to find his way home
, an outcast seeking family
, themes very familiar from most of spielberg
' s body of work from sugarl
and express to close encounters of yhe third kind to e
. t
. to empire of the sun tothe hook to saving private ryan
, naming jsut a few examples
. a
. i
. is set in an undefined near future in which giant technological advances have led to the creation of robots who serve every purpose from housekeeping to fulfilling sexual fantasies
. it is an era wehn robots are treated merely as sophisticated appliances
. the last great leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions
,
and with the number of births limited by yhe government
, many couples are yearning for children
.
and professor hobby
( william hurt
) has the solution
. a robotic boy named david
( haley joel osment
)
, who is programmed to love
. as a test
, david is placed with henry swinton
( sam robards
)
and his wife
, monica
( frances o
' connor
)
. their natural
- born son has been cryogenically frozen until a cure cant be found fo his illness
. the first third of a
. i
. deals with david
' s life with the swintons
and how that is changed by the recovery
and return of their son
, martin
. circumstances force david to be cut off from the swintons
. he is ab
andoned anbd alone
. david
, highly influenced by the fairy tale
, pinocchio
, feels that if he becomes a real boy he can rekindle monica
' s love for him
. the film
' s second act follows david
' s search fo the blue fairy
, whom he believes will be able to fulfill his wish
. during these adventures he meets
and is helpped by gigolo joe
( jude law
)
, a robot who specializes in sex
. spielberg isnt at his top form in tihs sequence
, offering a brutal
" flesh fair
" where robots are destroyed via sadistic methods for the amusement of paying customers
. here
, is where kubrick
' s influence is strongly felt
, as thte movie explores the fear
and distrust humans have forthe robots
. the savagery conjures up images from the late director
' s a clockwork orange
. at about two hours
and 30 minutes
, the film beggins to falter during the last 20 minutes
, a sequence that seems most spielbergian with images that appear to be borrowed fomr close encounters
. it is all very anti
- climatic
and jarring
. these scenes seem almost superfluous
, as if from a different film
. a
. i
. is a dark fairy tale that deserves its pg
- 13 rating
. it is a story combining hope
and intolerance
, sacrifice
and bigotry
,
and while it does not coalesce perfectly
, the movie does offer some disturbing images
.
but a
. i
. is really a showcase for the acting talents of the amazing young osment
. if ever an actor deserved an academy award nomination
, it is this lad
, who brings a sense of joy
and wonder to the role of david
, a being created fo the express purpose of loving
. he shines when with monica
, beaming with love
, as eager as a puppy to please
. after being left in tghe woods
, he is confused
, lost
, hurt
, focusing on noe objective
: to become a real boy
and find his way home so he can redeem himself in his mother
' s eyes
. law is pleasant as the care
- free robot who really doesn
' t underst
and david
' s quest
, bu is nonetheless hapyp to help him on his journey
. probably the toughest role is o
' connor
' s monica
. playing an emotional fragile woman who sees david as a substitute for her lost martin
, she grows conflicted after her boy returns
and she begins to perceive david not as a second chance
,
but as a threat to her family
. she gives her character enough emotional chaos that you cannot fault her for her course of action
. many of a
. i
.
' s futuristic sets are breathtaking
, especially a mostly submerged new york
, lost to the world by the melting of the polar ice caps
. a
. i
. isnt a flawed film
,
and yuo cannot get through the entire feature without pondering
- even subconsciously
- how it would have turned out with kubrick instead of spielberg behind the camera
. would it have been darker
? more cynical
? we will never know
. we can only judge what is before us onthe the screen
, a collaboration of two cinematic giants
. a
. i
. is a most interesting
and
thought
- provoking examination of a future that is quickly gaining onthe us
.
