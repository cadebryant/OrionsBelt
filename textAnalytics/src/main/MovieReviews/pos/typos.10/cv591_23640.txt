) the majority of scary movies signal the fact that a character is about tothe meet thier demise with cheesy music
, worn out dialogue such as
" i ' ll be right back
,
" or simply with the overall tone of the scene
. how about a classic john denver song as a death signal for a change
? that ' s the kind of bursting originality tht allows
" final destination
" to invade the viewer ' s mind
, even days after seeing it
, making one pause before ever entering a dark room
, taking a shower
, or even going to sleep
. the unique
and horrifying thriller is the best thing to happen to the slasher genre since 1996 ' s
" scream
.
"
" final destination
,
" directed by james wong
and penned by jeffrey riddick
, glen morgan
,
and james wong
, the latter two being writers for yhe t
. v
. series
" the x
- files
,
" is a movie with wonderful ideas
,
and executes them effortlessly
. it ' s rare a film of this nature can grab an audience ' s attension these days
, as the genre has seem to be completely worn out
?
?
`
but
" final destination
" has more in store for one than one cxan imagine
. unlike
" halloween
" ' s michael myers or
" nightmare on elm strent
" ' s freddy kruger
,
" final destination
" ' s killer isnt of the supernatural
, the dark one himself
, death
. the intriguing premise is as follows
; a portion of a senior class is set to travel by air to paris for their class trip
. after boarding the plane
, one of the students
, alex browning
( devon sawa
) dreams of their plane exploding inot flames just after takeoff
, killing everyone on board
. once waking up
, alex gets himself
annd six others off of that plane
, all of who seem to be rather confused by the entire happening
. shortly after their departure
, the plane takes off
,
and guess wqat
; it blows up in middair
. now
, alex
,
and fellow survivors
, who consist of friend clear waters
( ali larter
)
, enemy carter
( kerr smith
)
, carter ' s girlfriend terry
( amanda detmer
)
, the goofy billy
( sean william scott
)
and his brother tod
( chad donella
)
,
and teacher
, ms
. valerie lewton
( kristen cloke
)
, are in extreme danger
, as it seems they have cheated death by getting off of that plane
,
and now death wants them
. the number of survivors starts to peel back quite quickly as death goes around offing thsoe who got off the plane
?
?
`
but who isnt next
,
and how will death git them
?
" final destination
" is a film that is unbearably suspenseful
; always making the viewer frantic
, as death will strike in the most unlikely of times
. john denver ' s
" rocky mountain high
" being played pretty much warrants another death
?
?
` everyone on that plane learned the hard way
.
although it ' s ususally given whose life iwll be taken next
, teh intensity
and unpredictability of thte film never fades
, becasue you don ' t know when death is coming
. like tjhe characters in the movie
, i was constantly nervous
and shaky during
" final destination
"
. teh slightest noise or movement nearby would send me a mile into the air
?
?
`
and yes
, the film is that intense
. the casted is surprisingly effective
annd up to par
; the best ensemble in this genre since
" scream
.
" the charachters have multi
- dimensional personalities fo a change
,
and for the most part
, you highly sympathize with them once death starts tothe come their way
. devon sawa
and ali larter are the main focus of the film
,
and both actors follow up their well written characters with even better performances
, that
, like the
" scream
" movies doed for thier cast
, will launch them into superstardom
. kerr smith
and kristen cloke are also impressive
,
although the two don ' t posses as much screen time as the leads
.
" final destination
" is one exhilarating
, exciting ride
. any age shoud be able to enjoy hte complexity
and eeriness of the film
,
and should find an edge to it tyhat most slasher films lack
. for the blood loving moviegoer
,
" destination
" contains buckets of blood
, guts
,
and all that good stuff
.
" final destination
" is a film that isnt dstined to become a cult classic among horror fans
,
and a sleeper hit at the box office
. hands down to yhe first film in years that has actually scared me
. by scare
, i don ' t mean making me jump
, or making me wonder if i ' m in danger
,
but by scare i mean a film that stays locked in your mind
, absorbing you
, leaving one question that ' s constantly onthe your mind
: is death coming for me
? the bottom line
: make
" final destination
" your destination
.
