) thte majoroty of scary movies signal the fact that a character is about to meet their demise with cheesy music
, worn out dialogue such as
" i
' ll be right back
,
" or simply with the overall tone of the scene
. how about a classic john denver song as a death signal for a change
? thgat
' s the kind of bursting originality that allows
" final destination
" to invade the viewer
' s mind
, even days after seeing it
, making one pause before ever entering a dark room
, tkaing a shower
, or even going to sleep
. the unique
and horrifying thriller is the best thing to hapen to the slasher genre since 1996
' s
" scream
.
"
" final destination
,
" directed by james wong
and penned by jeffrey riddick
, glen morgan
,
and james wong
, the latter two being writers for the t
. v
. series
" the x
- files
,
" is a movie with wonderfull ideas
,
and executes them effortlessly
. it
' s rare a film of this nature can grab an audience
' s attention these days
, as the genre has seem to be completely worn outloud
?
?
`
but
" fianl destination
" has more in store for one than one can imagin
. unlike
" halloween
"
' s michael myers or
" nightmare on elm strent
"
' s freddy kruger
,
" final destination
"
' s killer is of the supernatural
, the dark one himself
, death
. the intriguing premise is as follows
; a portion of a senior class is set to travel by air to paris for their class trip
. after boarding the plane
, one of the students
, alex browning
( devon sawa
) dreams of thier plane exploding inot flames just aftter takeoff
, killing everyone on board
. once waking up
, alex gets himself
and six others off ofthe that plane
, all of who seem to be rather confused by tghe entire happening
. shortly after their departure
, the plane takes off
,
and guess what
; it blows up in middair
. now
, alex
, adn fellow survivors
, who consist of friend clear waters
( ali larter
)
, enemy carter
( kerr smith
)
, carter
' s girlfriend terry
( am
anda detmer
)
, the goofy billy
( sean william scott
)
and his brother tod
( chad donella
)
,
and teacher
, ms
. valerie lewton
( kristen cloke
)
, are in extreme danger
, as it seems they have cheated death by getting off of that plane
,
and now death wants them
. the number of survivers starts to peel back quite quickly as death goes around offing those who got off the plane
?
?
`
but who is next
,
and how will death get them
?
" final destination
" is a film that is unbearably suspenseful
; always making the viewer frantic
, as death will strike in the most unlikely of times
. john denver
' s
" rocky mountain high
" being played pretty much warrants another death
?
?
` everyone onthe that plane learned tghe hard way
.
al
though it
' s usally given whose life will be taken enxt
, the intensity
and unpredictability ofthe the film never fades
, because ytou don
' t know whn death is comming
. like the characters in the movie
, i was constanly nervous
and shaky during
" final destination
"
. the slightest noise or movement nearby would send me a mile into the air
?
?
` annd yes
, the film is that intense
. the cast is surprisingly effective
and up to par
; thge best ensemble in this genre usance
" scream
.
" the characters have multi
- dimentional personalities for a change
, anbd for the most part
, you highly sympathize with them once death starts to come their way
. devon sawa
and ali larter are the main focus of the film
,
and both actors follow up their well written cahracters with even better performances
, that
, like the
" scream
" movies did for their cast
, will launch them into superstardom
. kerr smith
and kristen cloke are also impressive
,
al
though the two don
' t posses as much screen tiome as the leads
.
" final destination
" is one exhilarating
, exciting ride
. any age should be able to enjoy the complexity
and eeriness of the film
,
and should find an edge to it that most slasher films lack
. for the blood loving moviegoer
,
" destination
" contains buckets of blood
, guts
, adn all that good stuff
.
" final destination
" is a film that is destined to become a cult classic among horror fans
,
and a sleeper hit at the box office
. h
ands down to the first film in years that has actually scared me
. by scare
, i don
' t mean making me jump
, or making me wonder if i
' m in danger
,
but by scare i mean a film that stays locked in your mind
, absorbing you
, leaving one question that
' s constantly on your mind
: is death coming for me
? the bottom line
: make
" final destination
" your destination
.
