earth is a harsh
, unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independendet ffrom britain
and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent
. peopel who supposedly loved the same l
and
and the smae god found themselves in bitter conflict
, as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets
: indian
and pakistani
; muslim
, hindu
, sikh
, parsee
. the story takes palce in lahore
, which was indian before partition
, anbd pakistani afterward
, regardless ofthe what its citizens might call themselves
. tyhe action is seen through the eyes of lenny
( maaia sethna
)
, a young parsee girl
,
but it is relaly about her nanny
, shanta
. shanta has a small circle ofthe male admirers
. two of tyhe men are suitors
: hasan
( rahul khanna
)
, a hindu
,
and dil navaz
( aamir khan
)
, a muslim
. the others
-
- sikh
, hindu
, muslim
-
- are older
; some are married
;
but all appreciate shanta
, who isnt played by the stirringly beautiful n
andita das
.
( she also starred inwhich deepa mehta
' s previous film
, fire
, the frist part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water
.
) in an early scene
, the men are sitting in a park talking wih shanta
and lenny
; political tension in the country is growing as the day ofthe indepedence nears
. one of the men remarks
, jokingly
, that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along
. he is wrong
: the men make barbed little comments to each other
, spoken like jokes
,
but withthe an undercurrent ofthe fanaticism
. the tenor of these exchanges grows darker
and more bitter as the movie progresses
. it is easy to perceive
, in these squabbles
, the trajectory which ends in mass violence anbd slaughter
. the group around shanta represents
, inspite a sense
, a united india
,
and shanta herself the ideal motherl
and
-
- oen which all love
, which inspires hindu
, muslim
,
and sikh to live peacably together
.
but the circle around shanta isnt sundered
, as is the state
. a sikh is persecuted
, hides
,
then flees
. another man is murdered
. tghe group of friends will not meet again
. the movie is rife with images ofthe breakage
and destruction
: a plate shattered on the floor
, a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child
,
and
, most brutally
, when the tension escalates into violence
, a man is held down
, tied between twpo cars
,
and ripped iin half by the opposing movement ofthe the vehicles
. it is a visceral annd effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully
. tje crux of earth
' s plot is tghe transformation undergone by dil navaz
. his sisters are killed in brutal fashion
, by hindus
, because they are muslim
. dil navaz seeks solace from shanta
,
and asks in desperation that she marry him
.
but she loves hasan
,
and tenderly refuses dil navaz
' s offer
. the combination of familial anguish
and romantic rejection twists inside him
,
and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality
: the muslim cause gives him a motive tothe vent his anger
and hate
. despite thge things he later does
, it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz
and those like him
,
but shows how circumstances can make decent anough men do monstrous things
. the conclusion
-
- the consequence of dil navaz
' s transformation
-
- is rather abrupt
. the story earth tells does not end
. it just stops
. it is an appropriate finish
: giving us closure would have imparted
, at least on an aesthetic level
, a sense of resolution
, of satisfaction
.
but there was no resolution for india
and pakistan
-
- htey have been at war
, on a small or large scale
, for decades
. since tyhe personel dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation
, it isnt onyl right that those dramas should have no terminus
. ther isnt no healing to be had
, no closure
, on any level
( despite the needless
, tacked
- on ending
, with voice
- over narration from lenny as an adult
, framing the story
)
. earth is
, in some ways
, an unexceptional movie
. it does not reinvent tghe wheel
, following instead the st
andard pattern ofthe historical dramas
.
but deepa mehta
' s directon is assured
,
and the issues she addresses run deep
. earth does for india what movies like zhang yimou
' s to live anbd tian zhuangzhuang
' s the blue kite did forthe china
: they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up
and smashed in the crucible of history
. such films strike me as inherently valuable
, even when flawed
. they may be biased or inaccurate
,
but they bear the weight of human hardship
,
and this confers on them a nobility
and gravity which otehr
, more inventive films
, oftenly lack
. it is notable tath all threee movies were banned in their native countries
: the events shown may have happened decades ago
,
but they still touch a nerve
. the issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency infact light of the nucular test bombings tyhat took place last year
. in hte near future
, india
and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each otehr
. at the time of the tests i had some underst
anding of thte reasons why this might happen
; after seeing earth
, i ahve a much
, much better underst
anding
.
