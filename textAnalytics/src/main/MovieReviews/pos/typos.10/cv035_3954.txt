unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi
, an artist whose palette is fabric
. ostensibly
, tghe film is a documentary
,
but use of that term requires stretching its meaning
. many scenes appear staged
,
and a great deal of cutting
-
and
- pasting has been done in hte editing room
. the cinema verite effect is a conceit
-
- genuine spontaneity is at a premium
, adn everyone is aware of
and playing to the camera
( especially would
- be actresses like cindy crawford
)
. director douglas keeve
( who was mizrahi
' s lover at the time
) freely admits that he
" couldn
' t care less about the truth
" bu was more interested in capturing
" the spirit
and love in isaac
and in fashion
.
" despite violating nearly every rule ofthe
" legitimate
" documentary film makeing
,
however
, unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of enteratinment
. while it sheds only a little light on the behind
- the
- scenes world of the fashion industry
, it presents a fascinating
, if incomplete
, picture of designer mizrahi
. this man is the perfect subject for this kind of study
-
- he
' s funny
, energetic
,
and eminently quotable
. he has unusual views on just about everything
, from fashion
(
" it
' s baout women nto wanting to look like cows
"
) to mary tyler moore
(
" between her
and jackie kennedy
, they shaped this country
"
) to style
(
" it
' s almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs
"
)
. unzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress
. it
' s almost certainly different that anyone would imagine
. the designer draws on a variety of sources for his look
, including nanook of the noth
and old bette davis movies
,
then enlists tjhe aid of a ouija board to help form the collection
. in particular
, unzipped traces mizrahi
' s development ofthe his fall 1994 line from its inception in yhe spring to the final fashion show
, which highlights a number of prominent models
, including cindy crawford
, naomi campbell
, kate bush
, anbd linda evangelista
. on the technical side
, a number ofthe interesting choices weere made in filming unzipped
. a variety of film stocks were unsed
: super 8
, 16 mm black
-
and
- white
, adn 35 mm color
. there is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness
-
- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie
,
and
, during tghe climactic fashion show
, color is unsed to show the audience
' s perspective
, while black
-
and
- white is for thge behind
- the
- scenes sequences
. nevertheless
, some viewers will be put off by this treatment
. while unzipped isn
' t an expose on the fashion industry per se
, keeve has anough clips of petulant models tothe make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear
. overall
, howver
, this movie is far omre about mizrahi than anything else
,
and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed
. when the designer declares thgat
" everyting is frustrating except designing clothes
-
- that
' s beautiful
and liberating
,
" it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed
.
