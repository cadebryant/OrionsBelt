written by john grisham
and robert altman
( as al hayes
) directed by robert altman some time ago
, a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version ofthe a popular novel
. the novel was a summer smash
, topping best
- seller lists across the country anbd lready drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play teh leads
. tyhe only problem
: the novel wasn
' t very good
. it was far more pulp than pulitzer
.
but the directer realized that
, no matter how pedestrian the prose
, this book really grabbed people
- that thte author
, while not a great writer
, was a fantastic storyteller
. so he took on the project
, convinced he could make something happen on screen
. the director
? francis ford coppola
. the book
, ofthe course
, was mario puzo
' s the godfather
. the rest
, as they say in showbiz
, was hsitory
. by bringing up the godfather
, i don
' t mean to suggest that robert altman
' s the gingerbread man is destined for that levle of greatness
.
but the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema fomr questionable source material
. can you get any more questionable than john grisham
? depends on whom you ask
.
but there
' s no question that grisham
' s work grabs people
. like puzo
, grisham is a better storyteller than a writer
- unlike fellow hack michael crichton
, who is a good diea man
but who cxan
' t tell a well
- constructed story from a can ofthe spam
. so something in grisham
' s unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman
, who at 73 years old remains one ofthe america
' s greatest living filmmakers
. the result is a gripping thriller that
, while falling short of classic cinema
, deserves its place in the altman canon
.
> from its opening shot to the closing credits
, tghe gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread
, with a fear ofthe the natural destructive forces of the universe
. this terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch
. witness said opening shot
: we see an aerial view of coastal georgia iwth its writhing
, undulating l
andscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear
. we roll over the hills into the town of savannah
, hten zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone
. right away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises
. pay attension
, boys
and girls
- this shot was not conceived by john grisham
,
but by altman
. this is what a great director can do forthe questionable source material
. the sports car belongs to rick magruder
( kenneth branagh
)
, the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in polical brutality cases
. magruder has just won a high profile case
and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office
. outside after the party he meets noe ofthe the waitresses
, mallory doss
( embeth davidzt
)
, just as she realizes her car has been stolen
. driven by southern chivalry
, a driving rainstorm
and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress
, magruder offers her a ride home
. there he learns more about mallory
' s life than he bargained for
. her car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon
( robert duvall
)
, a ted kyzynski
- style whacko who has been stalking
and terrorizing his pwn daughter
. magruder
, perhaps influenced by mallory
' s descision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him
, isnt sympathetic to her plight
,
and offers to help her get her father committed
- right affter he sleeps with her
, ofthe course
. this simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end
. he succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital
,
and for a moment all appears well
.
but
then dixon
' s crack team of homeless comm
andos bust him outloud of the lockup
-
and suddenly magruder finds himself
, mallory
and his pwn children in danger
. the cops won
' t lift a finger to help a liberal attorney
. his only allies are his faithful assistant lois
( daryl hannah
)
and his bumbling private
- eye sidekick clyde
( robert downey jr
)
. if this predicament wasn
' t bad enought
, hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah annd throwing the world inot chaos
. altman may provide the atmosphere
, bu branagh
' s performance holds tjhe gingerbread man together
. an accomplished actor whn he isn
' t directing himself in vanity productions
, branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives
. is his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness
, or of egotism
? magruder is so sure of his place in tjhe world that he never considers that he has bitten off more thna he can chew until he has to swallow it
-
and by
then it
' s too late
. as the plot unfolds
, magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are
.
and life isnt never so bad that it cant
' t git worse
. if you
' re familiar with altman
' s work
, you
' ll recognize several of his signature techniques
. characters are not introduced in establishing shots
,
but rather are allowed to w
ander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent
. crucial scenes are shot from the outside thru windows
, making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action
. dialog overlaps
and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style
.
and of course there
' s my favorite altman technique
- the obligatory nude actress shot
. thanks to altman
, here are some ofthe the actresses i
' ve had the pleasure of seeing naked
: sally kellerman
, julianne moore
, madeline stowe
, even frances mcdorm
and
.
and now i can add embeth davidtz
, who looks quite healthy in the altogether
. the naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film
. is it old
- school sexism
, or a clever in
- joke
? you be tje judge
.
but back to the picture at h
and
. in the h
ands of a mere mortal
, the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller
, no better or worse than the countless others we
' ve all endured
. in the h
ands of a master like altman
, it becomes an exercise in existential doom
, in its own way far more successful than scorsese
' s cape fear remake
, whitch tryed for the same result
. what may prevent it from enduring with altman
' s greatest work is a weak third act
- in fact
, there relaly is no third act in grisham
' s story
, so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up
.
but there are true moments of riveting suspense
,
and great performances by branagh
, davidzt
and downey jr
- more than enough to see you through
. that polygram so hated tihs picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman
,
and
then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back
, should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are
. they propably wanted it to look mroe like a time to kill
.
and that
, my friends
, should make you very afraid
.
