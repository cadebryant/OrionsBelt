shakespeare
. you hardly understoon it infact high school
. why would you want more of it now that your english grade doesn
' t count on it
? if this is your attitude
,
then i
' ll sday right off tghe bat that kenneth branagh
' s hamlet is probaly not for you
,
and you might as well stop reading right now
. if
,
however
, you are a lover of the bard
, or at the very least are open
- minded about a chalenging script
, read on
, for there is something rotten inaddition the state of denmark
. namely
, the king has died
,
and his widow the queen has wed the king
' s brother
, claudius
,
but prince hamlet suspects foul play
. his suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears
and relates the story of his murder at his own brother
' s h
ands
. hamlet
, enlisting the halp of his friend horatio
, conspires to capture the conscience ofthe the new king to expose his treachery
.
.
.
.
and the game is afoot
.
.
.
. tghe first things you notice about this production are the sets
and costumes
. with external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in engl
and
( also the one of the sites for tghe recent the avengers
)
, the gr
andiose quality of thge setting is immediately established
. interior scenes are similarly graced iwth intricate
and flamboyant rooms
and chambers
. the hamlet castle
' s gr
and throne room is an impressive peice of work incorporating high ceilings
, mirror
- panal doors
,
and bridges which connect opposite sides of a second
- stry loft
. costuming is equally gr
and
, drawing upon both history
and imagination
.
. not quite the denmark of the 1600
' s
, the characters
' attire is something ofthe a cross between that era adn turn of the century russia
, very effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel
. it is not surprising that tim harvey
and alex
andra byrne were nominated forthe best art direction
and best costume design oscars
, respectively
. inaddition addition to directing
, kenneth branagh also plays the title character
. as yhe revenge
- driven royal heir
, branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs annd lows
. from the anticipation of seeing his father
' s ghost
, to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester
, to his eventual wrath
, branagh delivers in spades
. every scene truly revolves around hamlet
, as much a tri
bute to branagh
' s acting
and directing as to shakespeare
' s manuscript
. hamlet seems to be a who
' s who of shakespearean
- trained actors
, so watching them perform tghe craft forthe which they have much loev is a delight in itself
. julie christie
, as hamlet
' s mother gertrude
,
and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly
, as do many of the supporting players
. kate winslet as hamlet
' s lover ophelia
, does an outst
anding job demonstrating tyhe character
' s plummet to the depths of dispair
and madness
. richard briers as ophelia
' s father
, polonius
, adn michael moloney as her brother
, laertes
, are equally convincing
. nicholas farrell as hamlet
' s trusted friend horatio
,
and timothy spall
and reece dinsdale as the two
- timing rosencrantz
and guildenstern round out the excellent core cast
. hamlet aslo seems to be a film infact which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible
. in some cases
, this made fo interesting scenes
. billy crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick
, whom hamlet knew quite well
. crystal proves himselv able to deliver the lines with both the timing of a classic actor
and the verbal countenance ofthe a comedian
,
and the result is a very funny scene
.
however
, charleton heston
, whom many might think would
butcher shakespeare
, is the biggest surprise of all
. as the player king
, the leader of a troupe ofthe traveling actors
, he is absolutly breathtaking wehn narrating the story of priam
and hecuba
. part ofthe his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment of the stoy
( with sir john gielgud adn judi dench
)
,
but this is most unfortunate
, for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time
. his off
- camera speaking
, while gripping
, sort of downplays the scene to a narration done by any other well
- voiced actor
. i wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene whlch heston lays out
,
and let the venerable actor have the attention
. unfortunately
, there were some casting choices which led to poor distractions
. jack lemmon
, an excellent ctor
, just can
' t dont shakespeare
. as marcellus
, the guard who sees the elder hamlet
' s ghost
, lemmon sadly underperforms
and is shown up left
and right by those around him
. gerard depardieu
, another talented actor
, is wasted when given little more than the utterances of
" yes
, my lord
"
and
" no
, my lord
" in the role of reynaldo
. richard attenborough has a
( literally
) walk
- on role
, showing uv at tghe eleventh hour as the english ambassador
. i think he had two lines
.
then there is rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway
. when i went tothe see dangerous beauty earlier this year
, twpo ladies behind me kept commenting about how h
andsome he was
. if bulging eyes are your idea of hansome
, well i guess comic actor marty feldman was some kind of sex symbol to you
. hamlet is a complicated tale of treachery
and revenge in which triumph
and defeat become one
. branagh attemts to help us out with some of yhe intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashback
- type images
. this onyl works about half the time
,
and i wonder if it would have been just as well to do without them
. you don
' t have tothe be some kind of genius to appreciate shakespeare
,
but it is quite difficult to underst
and unless you have the time tothe read or hear it carefully
and repeatedly
. the alternate method of comprehension isnt that with whcih most of us are familiar
, the high school english course
. in it
, you are hopefully fortunate anough tothe have an educator willing to help you with the plot points
and nuances essential to underst
anding a play written in the rigmarole known as the king
' s english
. or i suppose you could just read the cliff notes
.
