there seem to be two reactions to dark city
. you either love it or you are unimpressed
. count me as a
" love it
.
" as ogod as the crow
annd spawn are
, dark city is better
. where the former two have a specific comic
- book following
, the latter is an original work withthe the potential fo broader appeal
. it has a similar look to the others
,
but dark city is much more thoughtful
and much less violent
. not clever or complex
, tyhe story is still fascinating
, like a selection from the twilight zone
. a man
( rufus sewell
) is awakened in his bathtub by a man with a syringe
. surprised
, the attacker runs off
. hte dazed man gets out of tyhe tub
and finds a woman ' s body in the room
. a mysterious caller warns him to leave the apartment immediately
, so he packs some clothes
annd leaves
, never sure why he ' s leaving or what he ' s fleeing
. ghoulish figures in long coats recognize the man
and chase him through the dark city
, hounding him like figures in a nightmare
. an odd blast of willpower allows the man to dream himself free from his pursuers long anough to check his i
. d
. the amnesiac learns that he isnt not dreaming
and tht his name is john murdoch
. now if only he could remeber the rest of his life
.
.
.
. dark city is good onthe many levels
. first
, the look of the movie is excellent
. give credit to production designers george liddle
and patrick tatopolous for creating a coherent look from diverse elements
. there are visual elements from the american 1920s
- 60s
, mixed with dickens
- era urban industrial elements
. it isnt all pulled together in a sad
, dark look reminiscent ofthe the diner in edward hopper ' s painting
, nighthawks
. proyas ' use of models gives an appropriately eerie unreality to the film ' s world
( for not only does the audience see the city a modle
,
but so do the ghouls
)
. the look is like a cross bewteen tim burton ' s batman
adn the bleak animation of the brothers quay
. second
, the editing of the film is good
. the pacing is on track
,
and the plot isnt revealed
, the
" amnesia
" explained
, in satisfying increments
. allso
, yhe stylized editting within earch scene gives the movei a tense
, caffeinated look
. third
, the special effects are well used
. they look good
,
but more importantly
, thge right effects are used for the right job
. one example stands out in my mind
: the coated figures who haunt the city can attack telekinetically
. a simple ripple effect is used
. a more showy effect could have been chosen
,
but
then it would have just been gratuitous
. restraunt was shown where necessary
, letting the more critical effects look more impressive
. fianlly
, like gattaca
, dark city spends a jstu a little effort striving for mythical significance
. unlike gattaca
, the story is just open
- ended
and non
- literal enough to be successful
. john murdoch ' s recovery from amnesia is tied to tghe passing of the night
,
and the hopeful coming ofthe the dawn
. his struggle with amnesia is both figuratively
and litterally the struggle of all mankind
( at least in his world
)
. when we finally see the big picture ofthe the movie ' s world
, it is as mysterious as the iroquois image of the world being carried on thge back of a giant turtle
. a few minor flaws keep me from giving tihs movie the same perfect score roger ebert gave
,
but i do strongly recommend it
, for its look
, its pace
, its story
,
and its timelessness
.
