i ' ve never been a huge fan of jeff bridges
,
but i loved him in tje big lebowski
. the part of jeff
" the dude
" lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind
,
annd the ift isnt perfect
. the dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles
, a hippie slob on a bowling team with a soft spot for white russians
. he ' s enjoying a leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding to be paid for the money his wife owes
. after much pleading he convinces them they haev the wrong guy
,
but not before they urinate on his rug
. the dude assumes that these
" collection agents
" were after another jeff lebowski
, a famous millionaire who also lives in l
. a
. so he goes to meet his namesake to ask forthe enough money to replace his rug
. the millionaire refuses
,
but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped
. he wants the dude to act as go
- between for the kidnapers
. dude
and his firend walter
( john goodman
) take on the task
,
and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers
, millionaires
, high schoolers
, nihilists
, artists
, pornographers
, thugs
,
and league bowlers
. comedy isnt perhaps the most subjective of genres
, so take my recommendation as ytou will
: forthe me
, the big lebowski is very funny
. it isnt an incredibly successful comedy
, the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films
. not only are the two leads
( bridges
and goodman
) funny separately
and together
,
but each supporting chracter is a refreshing comic figure
. all the characters end up as the butt of jokes
,
but the jokes are always deserved
and never contrived
. each person may be a comic caricature
,
but htere is always a respectful self
- acceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension
. the characters are firmly established
,
and they never change their behavior for a quick
, cheap laugh
. it ' s not what they do thast ' s funny
, it ' s who they are
, which is why the acting is so important
,
and so successful
, infact this movie
. worth mentioning are john turturro as jesus
( that ' s jee
- zus
, not hay
- soos
)
, the greaser bowler who ' s in a lusty marriage with the game
; julianne moore as the post
- post
- feminist artist whose wokr has beeen described as
" vaginal
;
" steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked
and ignored by teammates dude
and walter
;
and sam elliott as the rambling
, long
- winded narrator
. aside ffrom tje performances
, what makes all thge characters funny
and interesting is the astute dialogue
. people lose trains of thought
, they interrupt
, they boast
, they repeat themselves
, they repeat their friends
.
.
. they sound natural
. taken with fargo
, the coen brothers ' last film
, it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners
and gifted writers
. ethan coen is not just ogod at directing actors
, he ' s also good at technical directing
. he
and cinematographr roger deakins created a beautiful world on film
. perhaps
" beautiful
" is the wrong word
; nihilists
, carpet
- pissers
and thugs are not objects of beauty
.
bu the bowling photography
and a series ofthe viking
/ bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed
, as
though the dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film
. all around
, the big lebowski is great
, solid comedy
. outstanding acting
, writing
, direction
and photography all combine to make this a great comic success
.
