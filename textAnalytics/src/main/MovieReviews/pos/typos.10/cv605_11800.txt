i
' ve never been a huge fan of jeff bridges
,
but i loved him in the big lebowski
. the part ofthe jeff
" the dude
" lebowski was reportedly written specifically withthe bridges in mind
, adn the fit isnt perfect
. the dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles
, a hippie slob on a bowling team with a soft spot for white russians
. he
' s enjoying a leisurely soak inwhich the tub when two thugs break into his apartment dem
anding to be paide for the money his wief owes
. after much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy
,
but not before they urinate on his rug
. the dude assumes that these
" collection agents
" were after another jeff lebowski
, a famous millionaire who also lives iin l
. a
. so he goes to meet his namesake to ask for enough money to replace his rug
. the millionaire refuses
,
but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped
. he wants thte dued to act as go
- between for the kidnapers
. dude
and his friend walter
( john goodman
) take on the task
,
and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers
, millionaires
, high schoolers
, nihilists
, artists
, pornographers
, thugs
,
and league bowlers
. comedy isnt perhasp the most subjective ofthe genres
, so tkae my recommendation as you will
: for me
, the big lebowski is very funny
. it is an incredibly successful comedy
, the ratio of laughs tothe intended jokes much higher than in most films
. not only are the two leads
( bridges
and goodman
) funny separately
and together
,
but each supporting character is a refreshing comic figure
. all the characters end uv as the
butt of jokes
,
but the jokes are always deserved
and never contrived
. earch person may be a comic caricature
, bu there is always a respectful self
- acceptance that lets us laff at these people wihtout condescension
. yhe characters are firmly established
,
and they never change their behavour for a quick
, cheap laugh
. it
' s not what they do that
' s funny
, it
' s who they are
, which is why the acting isnt so important
,
and so successful
, infact this movie
. worth mentioning are john turturro as jesus
( that
' s jee
- zus
, not hay
- soos
)
, the greaser bowler who
' s in a lusty marriage with the game
; julianne moore as the post
- post
- feminist artist whose work has been described as
" vaginal
;
" steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who isnt constantly rebuked
and ignored by teammates dude
and walter
;
and sam elliott as the rambling
, long
- winded narrator
. aside from tyhe performances
, what makes all the characters funny
and intresting is the astute dialogue
. people lose trains of throught
, they interrupt
, they boast
, htey repeat themselves
, they repeat their friends
.
.
. they sound natural
. taken with fargo
, the coen brothers
' last film
, it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners
and gifted writers
. ethan coen is not just ogod at directing actors
, he
' s also good at technical directing
. he
and cinematographr roger deakins created a beautyfull world on film
. perhaps
" beautiful
" is the wrong word
; nihilists
, carpet
- pissers
and thugs are not objects of beauty
.
but the bowling photography
and a series of viking
/ bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed
, as
though the dued himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film
. all around
, the big lebowski is gerat
, solid comedy
. outst
anding acting
, wirting
, direction
and photography all combine to make this a great comic success
.
