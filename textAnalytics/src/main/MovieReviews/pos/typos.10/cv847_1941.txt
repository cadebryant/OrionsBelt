' s point of view where she put a lot of family
and practical side of bruce lee
' s life
. howver
, you can
' t help
but liuke
, whenever the fight scenes are on
, what he can does with his body
and that familiar bruce attitude
and character
. i allso like the little bits of insight scenes about bruce lee
' s life before he became famous
: scenes like bruce practicing pronunciation of english
. it seemed as if he was no better than anybody else
. scenes like bruce delivering chinese food as a delivery boy ridding a bike through the american college looking at the
( all
- white
) students
, cheerleaders
, adn athletes
. it seemed he too wished for the american dreams
and hopes
. in conclusion
, the movie was well made
, it produced a realization of who bruce lee wass
,
and actor james lee was so much like bruce you have to remind yourself that he is just an actor
.
and the fighting scenes were all excellent
. so go see it adn enjoy the movie
. p
. s
. if you have seen the movie unforgiven by clint eastwood
,
then the feeling left after dragon was very much like the feeling you got after the unforgiven
