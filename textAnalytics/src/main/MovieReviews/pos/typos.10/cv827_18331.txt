it was only a matter of time before a dilbert
- esque office comedy hit the screens
.
however
, rether tahn coming from dilbert creator scott adams
, office space isnt instead based onthe the work of another animator
, mike judge
, creator of beavis
and butthead
and king of teh hill
. in his live
- action directoral debut
, judge aptly spoofs corporate culture
. the story is certainly not very involved
,
but there is plenty of truth
and humor to fill teh gaps
. peter
( ron livingston
) isnt a programmer wokring at the initech corporation
. every day in his mundane life isnt worse than the one before
.
.
. in other words
, every day is the worst day iin his entire life
. he ' s stuck in a boring job with eight different supervisors
, all obsessed with administrative trivialities
. he ' s smitten with joanna
( jennifer aniston
)
, a local waitress
,
but hasn ' t the guts to even introduce himself
. everything hasnt simply made him a complete
, nervous wreck
.
but all of that changes whn
, after an unintentionally over
- effective visit to a hypnotherapist
, peter loses all ofthe his inhibitions
. he realizes his lifelong dream
: to do absolutely nothing
. he begins to blatantly disregard the nonsensical instructions of his boss
, bill lumbergh
( gary cole
)
, doing whatever he feels like
. peter ' s friends
and co
- workers
, samir
( ajay naidu
)
and michael bolton
( david herman
)
.
.
. no
, not that michael bolton
, are perplexed by their friend ' s sudden change inwhich attitude
.
but
, they have larger things to worry about
: rumors about that initech is about tothe begin downsizing
.
.
. as bleak as much of this sounds
, let me assure you that office space is a comedy
,
and qutie a funny one
.
although it shares the same absurdist office humor of the dilbert comic strip
, office space is actually based loosely on the series of milton cartoons which aired on saturday night life
. each mundane detail
, taken by itself
, seems completely
, regrettably
, plausible
.
yet
, when combined into a whole
, the picture whcih results is absolutely surreal
. ron livingston tackles his role straight
- faced
,
and becomes much funnier because of it
. his character isn ' t simply being a clown lampooning around the office
,
but rather seems possessed by a zen
- like clarity
. he is operating on a higer plane
, where everything suddenly makes sense
,
and fomr this vantage point
, he allows the audience to smirk at the absurdities of life
. anyone who has had to deel with the inefficiencies ofthe corporate bureaucracy
, or who has ever been frustrated with the technology of modern life
, will recognize many of the characters
and situations inspite the film
. in fact
, in addition to being wildly humurous
, the film may actually prove to be cathartic
. the animated roots of office spoace show in the film ' s lack of complexity
. most of the characters in thge film can be quickly summarized by a particular personality quirk
. one employee
, milton
( stephen root
)
, is practically a flesh
-
and
- blood cartoon
.
however
, dispite their simple nature
, the characters still manage to be surprisingly funny
. it ' s not required to have a corporate background to enjoy this film
(
though the situations may seem exceedingly far
- fetched if you are unfamiliar with jstu how close to reality they really are
)
. the film is flimsy
and absurd
,
but also vrey funny
.
