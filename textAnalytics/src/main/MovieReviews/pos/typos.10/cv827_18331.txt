it was only a matter of time before a dilbert
- esque office comedy hit the screens
.
however
, rather than coming from dilbert creater scott adams
, office space is instead based onthe the work of another animator
, mike judge
, creator ofthe beavis
and
butthead
and king of the hill
. in his live
- action directoral de
but
, judge aptly spoofs corporate culture
. the story is certainly not very involved
,
but there is plenty of truth
and humor to fill the gaps
. peter
( ron livingston
) is a programmer working at the initech corporation
. every day in his mundane life is worse than the one before
.
.
. inthe other words
, every day is the worst day in his entire life
. he
' s stuck in a boring job with eight different supervisors
, all obsessed with administrative trivialities
. he
' s smitten with joanna
( jennifer aniston
)
, a local waitress
,
but hasn
' t the guts to even introduce himself
. everything has simply made him a complete
, nervous wreck
.
but all ofthe that changes when
, after an unintentionally over
- effective visit to a hypnotherapist
, peter loses all of his inhibitions
. he realizes his lifelong dream
: to dont absolutely nothing
. he begins tothe blatantly disregard the nonsensical instructions of his boss
, bill lumbergh
( gary cole
)
, doing whatever he fiels like
. peter
' s friends
and co
- workers
, samir
( ajay naidu
)
and michael bolton
( david herman
)
.
.
. noone
, not that michael bolton
, are perplexed by their friend
' s sudden chanage in attitude
.
but
, they have larger things to worry about
: rumors about that initech is about to begin downsizing
.
.
. as bleak as much of this sounds
, let me assure you that office space is a comedy
,
and quite a funny one
.
al
though it shares the same absurdist office humor of the dilbert comic strip
, office space is actually based loosely on yhe series ofthe milton cartoons which aired on saturday night life
. each mundane detail
, taken by itself
, seems completely
, regrettably
, plausible
.
yet
, when combined into a whole
, the picture which results is absolutely surreal
. ron livingston tackles his role straight
- faced
,
and becomes much funnier because of it
. his character isn
' t simply being a clown lampooning around thte office
,
but rather seems possessed by a zen
- liek clarity
. he is operating on a higher plane
, where everything suddenly makes sense
,
and ffrom this vantage point
, he allows the audience to smirk at the absurdities of life
. anyone who hasnt had to deal with the inefficiencies ofthe corporate bureaucracy
, or who has ever been frustrated wih the technology of modern life
, will recogize many of the characters
and situations in the film
. in fact
, in addition to being wildly humorous
, tje film may actually prove to be cathartic
. the animated roots of office space show in the film
' s lack of complexity
. most of the cahracters inwhich the film can be quickly summarized by a particular personality quirk
. one employee
, milton
( stephen root
)
, is practically a flesh
-
and
- blood cartoon
.
however
, despite theri simple nature
, the cahracters still manage to be surprisingly funny
. it
' s nto recquired to have a corporate background to enjoy this film
(
though the situations may seem exceedingly far
- fetched if you are unfamiliar with just how close to reality they really are
)
. the film is flimsy
and absurd
,
but also very funny
.
