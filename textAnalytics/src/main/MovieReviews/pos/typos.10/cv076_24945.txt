logical time travel movies are a near
- impossibility
. considering that the skeptic
' s best argument agianst the possibility of time travel is tyhe idea of altered realities
, writing a scirpt that deals with this probelm is an imposing task
. occasionally
, we git a film that does manage it
. terry gilliam
' s
" 12 monkeys
" was one such film
.
but more frequently
, we get films that don
' t much deal with it at all
. there is one question to ask in this case
: does the film have other virtues that override tyhe existing logical inconsistencies
? the
" terminator
" films made up for them with exciting action
,
" back to the future
" did it with an entertaining story
, anbd the new film
" frequency
" pulls off the trick witht a strong package of its own
. is
" frequency
" filled iwth plot holes
? yes
. does it marter
? not really
. the film opens in october of 1969
. firefighter frank sullivan
( dennis quaid
) puts his life onthe the line eveyr time he suits up fo his job
,
then goes home to his loving wife julia
( elizabeth mitchell
)
and son johnny
( daniel henson
)
. the double
- pronged story flashes forward to 1999
, where johnny
( now jim caviezel
) is all grown up
and working as a police detective
. a strange occurrence
-
- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city
-
- allows father
and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in
' 69
and tht john has found inwhich the present day
.
though both are initially skeptical of the idea
, john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire
,
and he succeeds in saving frank fomr certain doom
. now flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive
, john is initially overjoyed
, until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous
: a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women
. frank
and john now must work together to set things right
, with john using yhe information he has gathered in hte future to instruct frank on what to do in the past
. the premise of
" frequency
" is unusual
,
and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept
: john annd frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions
. thsi isn
' t explained
; you just have to go with it
. when frank doesn
' t die inspite a fire
, john is the only one who remembers it differently
, hwile everyone else remembers it the new way
. the concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities
-
- 1969
and 1999
-
- are to each other
. sometimes frank
' s changing the past results in something happening right away in john
' s world
,
and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time
. now
, the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this
,
and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted
(
but nevertheless logical
) if i
thought about it hard enough
( for example
, the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer
' s murders was because the change had already happened iin frank
' s world
,
and john is only witnessing the
* projection
* of that chanage
)
,
but explanations aren
' t really the point
. when
" frequency
" gets cooking
, it
' s a riveting little thriller
, even if it is confusing
. what matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment
,
and
" frequency
" works as long as it keeps moving
. thge film manages tothe be engaging despite the logical confusion
. director gregory hoblit
and screenwriter toby emmerich structure
" frequency
" as good hollywood entertainment
, establishing decent
, likable characters
, making us care for them
,
and setting up a goal to be reached
and a conflict to be resolved
. i liked many of the creative touches
: the split screens
, allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities
,
and the greater framework ofthe baseball to drive the acation forward
. it actually uses the 1969 mets
- orioles world series
( the one that featured tghe amazin
' mets
) to great effect
-
- frank uses john
' s advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him
.
( admittedly
, htis device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself
.
) i even liked the final scene
, which features frank
and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods
. some may find this scene blindingly confusing
, as the reality shifts start coming fast
and furious
,
but it does make sense if you thikn baout it
(
and give the scirpt a lot of leeway
)
,
and let
' s face it
: it
' s a darn cool way to end the film
. there are enough surprises
and plot twists in
" frequency
" to keep you on your toes
,
and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant
. the other major thing to appreciate about
" frequency
" is the h
andling of thge father
- son relationship
. quaid
and caviezel carry off their parts easily
; it
' s a rock
- solid job from both actors
. the relatiopnship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept
: how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative
, or with a future descendant
? watching the exchanges between frank
and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question
. the credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film
; if we don
' t believe in the characters
, we don
' t care about the outcome of the thriller plot
. here
, we do care
, because we like the lead actors
. i also liekd some of the supporting cast members
. elizabeth mitchell gets sticked with two thankless roles
, palying julia the doting wife
*
and
* mother
,
but still performs admirably
.
andre braugher
, late of the television show
" homocide
: life on the strent
,
" gives a nice supporting turn as frank
' s best friend anbd future colleague of john
. he has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain tje situation to julia hwile frank
' s world series predictions come true before his very eyes
. braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here
, simultaneously dismayed adn ammused
. perhaps the onyl thing i didn
' t like about
" frequency
" is the overly sentimental coda
, during which the camera
' s foucs goes a little too soft
and the baseball theme gets carried overboard
.
but that
' s only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics
. i freely acknowledge that
" frequency
" may best work as a
" guy
" movie
, since it focuses onthe the very male
- oriented idea ofthe father
- son relationships
( echoes of
" field of dreams
" can be easily heard
)
,
but the underlying concept is universally applicable
. who wouldn
' t want to speak with a long
- dead parent
? or see how their children turn out
?
" tell me about your life
, son
"
-
- excuse me while i mist up
.
and don
' t call me a sissy
.
