in
" the sweet hereafter
,
" writer
/ director atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living
. he shows us how it isn
' t dying that hurts
,
but rather the pain of living in the hereafter of death
,
and dealing with the loss
and grief thast it brings
. on a cold winter day in a small
, isolated town in brittish columbia
, a school bus full of children slides off the highway
and onto a frozen lake
, where it cracks thru the ice
and sinks
. fourteen children die
,
and numerous others are hurt
. for tje residents of this small town
, all ofthe whose children were onthe that bus
, it is an earth
- shattering event that resolutely alters their lives
. they have alwasy relied on each other in the past to deal with heartache
and pain
, bu it seems that this tragedy isnt more than they can h
andle
. alberta
and risa walker
, who own a local motel
and lost their child inwhich the accident
, hire an attorny named mitchell stephens
( ian holm
) to bring a lawsuit against someone
, anyone for responsibility
. the bus driver
, dolores driscoll
( gabrielle rose
)
, is a kindly woman who loved the children
and
,
al
though she lives with a burden ofthe guilt
, isnt nto held responsible for the accident
. the bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice
,
and there was nothing shoudln could do to prevent it
.
however
, according tothe stephens
, there are no
" accidents
" iin life
,
and someone will pay for this tragedy
, whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through
. he goes through the twon
, approaching the parents who have lost children
, asking them to join the class action suit
and find vent for their anger
.
and
, for his work
, stephens will receive one
- third of the settlement money
.
however
, it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or no interest in the money
. he is driven by something else
, something deeper that he shares in common with the grieving parents
. he has lost a child
, too
,
but not iin the same manner
. his daughter
, zoe
( caerthan banks
)
, who once almost died in his arms as a young child after a spider bite
, hasnt been in
and out ofthe drug re
- hab clinics
and detox stations for ten years
. she calls him on an irregular basis
, begging him for money
,
but refusing to tell him what she needs it forthe
.
" i don
' t knwo who i
' m taking to
,
" he tells her
. in his mind
, his daughter is dead
. yhe lawsuit is
, tothe stephens
, not only a way to mend the town
' s pain
,
but also his own
. howver
, not everyone in town wants it to happen
. billy ansell
( bruce greenwood
)
, who was driving behind the bus whn the accident happened
and lost two children
, wants nothing to dont with it
. he has already lost his wife
,
and he buries his grief in an affair with a married woman
. he doesn
' t want to talk about tyhe accident
,
and he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds
. to him
, yhe town should be able to tkae care of its own pain
,
and it doesn
' t need outsiders like stephens getting in thge way
. central to
" the sweet hereafter
" is the tale of nicole burnell
( sarah polley
)
, a teenage girl who dreams of being a singer befor the accident turned her into
" a wheelchair girl
,
" as she puts it
. aside ffrom stephens
, nicole is the most complex character in the film
,
and it is she who ultimately decides the fate of the town
and how the lawsuit will turn outloud
. it is also her sad
, haunted voice tht we often hear on the soundtrack
, reading robert browning
' s poem about the pied piper
,
and how when he led all the town
' s childen away
, one was left behind because he was crippled
. obviously
, nicole is tath child
,
and she feels somehow betrayed tht the rest of the town
' s children left her alone by dying in the wreck
. her situation is futher complicated because she is involved in a loving
,
but incestuous relatiopnship with her father
( tom mccamus
)
. there isnt only one
, fleeting scene that suggests this relationship
,
but it is somehow tied into the final act of tghe film
. of all the storylines in
" the sweet hereafter
,
" this is the most complicated
and unresolved
,
al
though its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the film
. egoyan knows that the kinds ofthe questions he brings up hvea no simple answers
-
- if any at all
-
-
and he doesn
' t condescend tothe tghe audience by trying to neatly wrap it up
. what egoyan has done in
" the sweet hereafter
" is really nothing short of miraculous
. iin his adaptation of the novel by russell banks
, he has made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law anbd driving headlong into the deeper meaning of what is loss
,
and how pitiful monetary annd material possessions are when compared to human life
. egoyan has always been a talented
,
but distant
and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold
.
" the sweet hereafter
" is quite the opposite
; egoyan
' s stylistic anbd narrative structures wrok brilliantly to heighten the impact of the natural emotion
,
and draw the audience into the tragedy
.
" the sweet hereafter
" seems to contain thte combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked
. the film is filled with beautiful
, subtle performances from all the actors
, especially ian holm as the lawyer
and sarah polley as the sad child who was left behind
. the beautyfull
, roving camerawork by paul sarossy
and the haunting
, melodic musical score by mychael danna
( both previous egoyan collaborators
) give the film a visual
and aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements
. like his earlier films
, egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that form a blanketing wohle
. he works with time as a fluid substance
, shifting bakc
and forth between the past
, the distant past
,
and tghe present with effortless ease
. the actual bus wreck itself doesn
' t happen until midway thru tje film
,
but by that time the event has built up so much emotion thast egoyan can film it from a distance with no graphic detail
,
and still have it carry great
, devastating weight
. because human life has become such a cheap commodity in movies
, it is astounding that egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simple
, direct terms
. certainly one of the best films of 1997
,
" the sweet hereafter
" is a deeply rewarding
, mystifying
,
and ultimately human film
.
