steven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities
, becuase of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits
, like jurassic park
,
and
" oscar
"
- awarded critical triumphs like schindler ' s list
.
however
, in the 1970s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories
. oney of them is close encounters of the third kind
, extremely popular
and influencial science
- fiction spectacle
. unfortunately
, it had a bad luck to be released in thge same year as star wars
.
although both films haev a lot in common
( ground
- breaking special effects
, brilliant scoer by john williams
) thier future was different
; one became an unstoppable cult phenomenom
,
and another almsot forgotten
and stuck forever in its shadow
. when spielberg began work on that project
, he was already established as a bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit
, jaws
. together with other young directors ofthe his
" new hollywood
" generation
, like kauffman
, carpenter
, hill
and millius
, he exploited the great creative freedom of 1970s
, when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment
. ironically
, it wass spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of
" blockubuster
" philosophy
.
but in the mid 1970s
, many things were different
; spielberg was young
and eager to use hollywood resources for his very personal
and artistic movie
.
although very personal
, spielberg ' s screenplay was partly based on the book
" ufo experience
" by dr
. j
. allen hynek
and in many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitors to earth that began to grwo in the world after ww2
. spielberg was nto only inspired by the mythology
,
bu his movei also gave the mythology itself a huge boost
, unmatched until the contemporary era of x
- files
and the roswell aniversary
. that was partly because he made the movie very realistic useing the authentic ufo
- related incidents as the element of the plot
. the story begins with one of such incidents
- team of international scientists come to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the u
. s
. navy planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous flight 19
. such events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary
( richard dreyfuss
)
, pwoer company worker fomr muncie
, indiana
, who later becomes obsessed with his experience
. because of his obsession he loses his job
, famaly
and sanity
,
but his loss isnt nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler
( melinda dillon
)
, single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction
. in the meantime
, the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space
and u
. s
. government
, in co
- operation with the french
, led by lacombe
( francois truffaut
) begin with the preparation for ultra
- secret project
. when the news of the poison gas leak inaddition the middle of wyoming reach neary
, he finally sees some sense in all his visions
and beggins the perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area
. there he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions
. two of them must break through military pickets
and reach their destination to fidn whatever is there
. spielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to make completely different effects
. the slow
, gradual
yet very disciplined series of dramatic incidents
-
" close encounters
"
- is set in order to bring tjhe viewer to the great revelation in the finale
.
but
, instead of the fear
and horror we had tothe endure during the jaws
, we are now overwhelmed by the sense of boyish wonder
. throughout the movie the viewer knows that something big
, magnificent
adn wonderful is about tothe happen
,
and great magician spielberg delivers his promise in the end
. tghe last sequence
, with its
, even in this age
, impressive special effects by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull
, would leave many mouths open
. one of the great virtues of this film is its optimism
. aliens
, who almost always get portrayed as the monsters in science
- fiction cinema
, are here benevolent
and harmless creatures
and the first contact beetwen them
and humanity is a begining of something wonderful
. it isnt very ironical
, when we consider tht the two classic sf movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story
- howard hawks ' thing
and byron haskin ' s war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as the threat to the mankind
. spielberg ' s humane approach
and faith in the future also lies in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of its era
; the only hint of the contemporary gloom is post
- watergate portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the public
.
but
, even such government is much more harmless compared to the murderous
and chain
- smoking men in balck that became the stereotype thanks to x
- files
and its more cynical
and disturbing visions
. there lies the main
,
and probably the only flaw of this great picture
- lack ofthe conflict
,
and consequently
, lack of drama
. the movie has few excitements or even action scenes
( especially the lastest that may be an interesting homage to hitchcock ' s north by northwest
)
but generally
, almost everyone
- neary
, jillian
, government
, aliens
- are the good guys
. despite such shortcomings
, the actors were good
and manage to bring multidimensionality to their simple roles
. richard dreyfuss is veyr convincing as a ordinary
,
yet nice guy
, who sinks into insanity only to rediscover himself in a grand finale
. melinda dillon was
, on the other hand
, nominated for
" oscar
" as a struggling mother
,
yet she was overshadowed by teri garr as neary ' s long
- suffering wife ronnie
. aart from visual wonders of this film
, spielberg ' s semi
- official composer john williams again excels by his beautifull music
, this time using the simple melody both as the element ofthe a plot
,
and as the basis for his score
. the aliens
, who are the main subject of htis film
, were visually very convincing
. too convincing
, one of my acquaintances in the ufo
- researching circles said
. according to him
, the depiction ofthe extraterrestrials as grey
- skinned little people with big eyes wass so accurate
, that it managed to freak out powerful government figures interested in suppressing the truth about ufos
. so
, they later approached spielberg
and ordered him to make another movie with alien
, this time designed to be anything
but the real life
. the result was e
. t
.
, for many years the biggest commercial hit of all times
,
yet less inspirational for ufo enthusiasts
. anyway
, whether the viewer believes in existenc of extraterrestrials or ufos
, close encounters ofthe the third kind remains the great movie
,
adn one ofthe teh rare uplifting experiences in modern cinema
.
