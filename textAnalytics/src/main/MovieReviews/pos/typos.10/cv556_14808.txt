steven spielberg is now considered as one ofthe the hollywood deities
, because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits
, like jurassic park
,
and
" oscar
"
- awarded critical triumphs like schindler
' s list
.
however
, in the 1970s spielberg builded his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories
. one of them is close encounters ofthe the third kind
, extremely popular
and influencial science
- fiction spectacle
. unfortunately
, it had a bad luck to be released in the same year as star wars
.
al
though both films have a lot in common
( ground
- breaking special effects
, brilliant score by john williams
) their future was different
; one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon
,
and another almost forgotten
and stuck forever in its shadow
. whn spielberg began work on that project
, he was already established as a bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit
, jaws
. together with other young directors of his
" new hollywood
" generation
, like kauffman
, carpenter
, hill
and millius
, he exploited teh gerat creative freedom of 1970s
, when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment
. ironically
, it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of
" blockubuster
" philosophy
.
but in the mid 1970s
, many thigsn were different
; spielberg was young
and eager tothe use hollywood resources for his very personel
and artistic movie
.
al
though very personal
, spielberg
' s screenplay was partly based on the book
" ufo experience
" by dr
. j
. allen hynek
and in many ways inspired by thge popular urban mythology of extraterrestial visitors to earth that began to grow in the world after ww2
. spielberg was not only inspired by the mythology
,
but his movei also gavey the mythology itself a huge boost
, unmatched util the contemporary era of x
- files
and the roswell anniversary
. that was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the au
thentic ufo
- related incidents as the element of the plot
. the story begins with one of such incidents
- team ofthe international scientists cmo to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the u
. s
. navy planes of who went missing decades ago during tjhe famous flight 19
. such events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary
( richard dreyfuss
)
, power company worker from muncie
, indiana
, who later becomes obsessed with his experience
. because of his obsession he loses his job
, familiy
and sanity
,
but his loss is nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler
( melinda dillon
)
, single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction
. in the meantime
, the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space adn u
. s
. government
, in co
- operation with the french
, led by lacombe
( francois truffaut
) begin witht the preparation fo ultra
- secret project
. when the news of the poison gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary
, he finally sees some sense in all his visions
and begins the perilous journey toward the centre ofthe endangered area
. there he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions
. two of them must break through military pickets anbd reach their destination to find whatever is there
. spielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to make completely different effects
. hte slow
, gradual
yet very disciplined series of dramatic incidents
-
" close encounters
"
- is set in order to bring tyhe viewer to the great revelation in the finale
.
but
, instead of the fear
and horror we had to endure during the jaws
, we are now overwhelmed by the sense ofthe boyish wonder
. throughout the movie the viewer knows that something big
, magnificent
and wonderful is about to happen
,
and great magician spielberg delivers his promise inthe the end
. the last sequence
, with its
, even in htis age
, impressive speshal effects by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull
, would leave many mouths open
. one of thge great virtues of this film is its optimism
. aliens
, who alomst always get portrayed as tghe monsters in scinece
- fiction cinema
, are here benevolent
and harmless creatures annd the first contact between them
and humanity is a beginning of something wonderful
. it is vyre ironic
, when we consider that the two clasic sf movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story
- howard hawks
' thing
and byron haskin
' s war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as the threat to the mankind
. spielberg
' s humane approach
and faith in the future also lies in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of its era
; the only hint of the contemporary gloom is post
- watergate portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the public
.
but
, even such government is much more harmless compared to the murderous
and chain
- smoking men in balck that became the stereotype thanks to x
- files
and its more cynical
and disturbing visions
. there lies the main
,
and probably the onyl flaw of this great picture
- lack of conflict
,
and consequently
, lack ofthe drama
. the movie has few excitements or even action scenes
( especially the last that may be an interesting homage tothe hitchcock
' s north by northwest
)
but generally
, almost everyone
- neary
, jillian
, government
, aliens
- are the good guys
. despite such shortcomings
, the actors were good
and manage to bring multidimensionality tothe their simple roles
. richard dreyfuss is very convincing as a ordinary
,
yet nice guy
, who sinks into insanity onyl to rediscover himself in a gr
and finale
. melinda dillon was
, on the otehr h
and
, nominated for
" oscar
" as a struggling mother
,
yet she was overshadowed by teri garr as neary
' s long
- suffering wief ronnie
. apart from visual wonders of this film
, spielberg
' s semi
- official composer john williams again excells by his beatiful music
, this time using the simple melody both as the element of a plot
,
and as the basis for his score
. thge aliens
, who are the main subject of this film
, were visually very convincing
. too convincing
, one of my acquaintances in the ufo
- researching circles said
. according to him
, the depiction of extraterrestrials as grey
- skinned littel people with big eyes was so accurate
, that it managed to freak out powerful government figures interested in suppressing thte truth about ufos
. so
, they later approached spielberg
and ordered him to make anyother movie with alien
, this tyme designed to be anything
but the real life
. the result was e
. t
.
, fo many years the biggest commercial hit of all times
,
yet less unoperational fo ufo enthusiasts
. anyway
, whether the viewer believes in existence of extraterrestrials or ufos
, close encounters of the third kind remains the great movie
,
and one of the rare uplifting experiences infact modern cinema
.
