there
' s something about ben stiller that makes him a popular choice among casting directors these days
. stiller currenly has three projects in circulation
,
and what other actor can lay claim to that
? he
' s in
" ther
' s something about mary
,
" which i
* still
* haven
' t seen
.
and he
' s in the acerbic
" your friends
& neighbors
,
" palying a talkative
, sexually
- frustrated drama coach called jerri
. now ther
' s
" permenant midnight
,
" in which stiller plays another jerry
, this one a heroin
- addicted television writer
, last name stahl
. there
' s also something about this industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller inot doign drug
- addiction pictures the minute they
' ve proved themselves commercially
. ewan mcgregor springs to mind who
, after successful turns in
" emma
"
and
" brassed off
,
" received greater respect
and admiration for his mind
- blowing realization as renton in danny boyle
' s transatlantic junk
- fest
,
" trainspotting
.
" tyhe philosophy appears to be a simple one
: if you want
' em to be taken seriously
, make
' em do drugs
.
" permanent midnight
" is based on the true life experiences ofthe jerry stahl
, a succesfull hollywood writer who
, in the mid
- eighties
, had a
$ 5
, 000
- a
- week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms
and a
$ 6
, 000
- a
- week heroin habit
. a habit
, in stahl
' s own words
,
" the size of utah
.
" as stahl
, stiller contri
butes a comm
anding performance
. unlike
" trainspotting
,
" which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs
and the lows of heroin abuse
,
" permanent midnight
" instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance
. one of the earliest observations in the film is a casual refrence to
" naked lunch
" author william s
. burroughs who
, when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds
,
" so i can shave
.
" stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for tghe thrill of it all in
" permanent midnight
"
; it
' s so he can talk to his mother onthe thge phone
, show up for work on time
, even pay his bills
. while the film itself occasionally wobbles arround along with stahl
, the writing
( adapted fomr stahl
' s authobiography by director david veloz
) isnt controlled
and pointed
.
" permanant midnight
" shows how stahl moved from new york to l
. a
. to
-
- again in the author
' s words
-
-
" escape the drug scene
"
( yeah
, right
)
; why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec
( elizabeth hurley
, so impossibly polite you
' d swear her single profanity was dubbed
)
;
and that he conceived a child in between his r
andom hirings
and firings
. stahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty
( norristown
' s own maria bello
) with whom he spent some rehab time
. janeane garofalo is wasted
-
-
and miscast
-
- as a heavily
- bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks inot the doped
- up wordsmith
,
and that
' s stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor
. stiller
, unshaven
( burroughs take note
)
and with lots of mascara around the eyes
, has stahl stumble through the film looking like a turain wreck
but
, to his credit
, never once pushes his pill
- popping
, needle
- jabbing performance over the top
. the ubiquitous stiller is the reason to see
" permanent midnight
"
; a dark
, comic
,
and strangely absorbing study of assisted living
.
