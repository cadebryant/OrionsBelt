every once in a while you see a film that is so effective in delivering the goods that it is easy to forget
,
and forgive
, its glaring imperfections
. such is the case with
? good iwll hunting
?
, a subtle character study about a socially inept mathematics genius who struggles to fidn his path in life
. despite some serious character problems
, this is still a very good film
. you probably know about the plot so i
? ll make it quick
. will hunting
( damon
) is a janitor at m
. i
. t
.
, he
? s really smarter than einstein
but nobody knows it
. he likes to go out with his friend chuckie
( affleck
)
and their otehr working
- class buddies
and drink beer
. he
? s good
- looking
, charismatic
,
and witty
but has a terrible time with authority
and stiff college folk
. after getting into a tiff witht the law
, a distinguished professor
( skarsg
? rd
) discovers will
? s genius
and offers him a chance tothe clean up his record
and avoid jail timne
, at a price
: he must attened weekly sessions iwth a therapist
and work on vairous mathematical problems
( that have stumped the academic elite
) with the professor
. after outsmarting
and scaring the hell out ofthe a couple of different psychologists he meets his match when hooked up with a once
- promising therapist named sean maguire
( williams
) who has his pwn problems
. in the meantime will meets a british medical school student
( driver
)
and they beign to fall in love
. the story starts out well anough
and is a pretty original basis forthe a film
. even
though we
? ve seen movies about misunderstood
, erratic prodigies before
(
? shine
? ring a bell
?
)
, the script here creates a complex narrative that doesn
? t just focus souly onthe one character
. alas
though
, this is not a perfect film
, as much as you efel like it could
? ve been while watching it
. the one real problem i had with it is the unrealistic nature of the main character
. is it possible for a lowly janitor to be this intelligent
? of course
. is it possible for him to be estranged from any deep
, human relationships
? usually
, yes
.
but
, is it possible for him to also be so handsome
, funny
, quick with the tongue
,
and city
- street tough
? not very likely
. come on
, usually these guys are total nerds who cin
? t even buy their own shirts
, much less talk down a harvard student in a hip pub while picking up phone numbers fomr pretty med
.
- school girls
. will is just a little too perfect
,
and inwhich order to accept the character your disbelief suspension needs tothe be infront exelent working condition
. the heavy
- handed
, anti
- war statment made by will at a government job interview late in the film is also boorish
, overlong
, pompous
,
and completely unneccesary
. all this sounds pretty bad
,
but the film somehow makse up for it in otehr ways
. damon
? s acting overshadows the fact that the character is slightly unbelievable
, his performance is truly extraordinary
. wich leads me to the really good part of the review
. the strength of this movie can be summed up in oen single word
: acting
. i can
? t recall seeing a film recently that ws so well
- acted from top to bottom
. from minnie driver
? s frustrated lover to ben affleck
? s laid
- back best friend
,
and all the small roles in between
, the performances are magnificent
. robin williams
? skill is a given as a bereaved psychologist who could
? ve had a legendary career
but was knocked off the path somewhere down the line
. the real gem
though is stellan skarsg
? rd
? s turn as professor lambeau
, an award
- winning mathematician who feels reduced infact comparison to a younger
, smarter will hunting
. the scenes between williams
and skarsg
? rd
, as two old college pals who
? ve been brought back together by tihs enigmatic kid
, display some of the best acting i
? ve ever seen
. when i say delivering the goods
, this is what i
? m talking about
. watching these two work is what going to see movies is all about
. gus van sant
? s
( to die for
, drugstore cowboy
) cold
, urban direction is right on
, as well as danny elfman
? s sauntering musical score
. i highly recommend
? good will hunting
?
. despite its faults
, it is still an intriguing
and fascinating film
and yuo are not likely to see a better acted one thsi year
.
