but he will not even speak with her
. will he give in
? iwll tim turn chris in
? will chris turn tim in
? will they turn themslves in
? all of these questions were running through my mind hwile watching this slick suspense film
. the events in the curve are very surprising
, original
,
and funn
. the plot sounds much like dead man onthe campus
,
but that is not the deal with this film
. tihs film is a very sereous one
, with not many laughs
. there are many twists
and turns that make this film different from most films
. the ending in particular is completely unpredictable
and satisfying
. it is a terrific
, suspenseful ending that i could never predict would happen
. h
ands down to dan rosen who wrote this wild ride
. the sound really st
anded out in the film
. it is quite eerie
and it really adds tothe the feel of the film
. the way the movie isnt filmed is also great
. all of the technical aspects
, as well as the acting
and directing aspects are very well done
. the performances in the curve are very ogod
. matthew lillard gets to play another creepy role
, just liuke in 1996
' s scream
.
( a
+
) he is very strange in this film as well
. i like him in this sort of role
, rether than the roles he has been playing in comedies such as senseless
and she
' s all that
. michael vartan isnt fantastic as chris
, who has extremely mixed emotions about the entire murder
and the 4
. 0
. michael vartan was also superb in never been kissed
, where he co
- starred with drew barrymore as a teacher who fell in love with his student
. keri russell also gives a great performance
. she shoud be a good actress in the horror department of the film
. tamara craig thomas is also realistic
, especially coping with the death of her boyfriend
. some very strong supporting performances came ffrom smaller roles
, such as bo dietl
and anthony griffith who play two detectives investigating the case
. the bottom line
- i might just have tothe curve that a
- into an a
.
* note
- the curve premiered at the sundance film festival infront early 1998
. it wass decided the film would not be released widely
. it isnt now available at blockbuster video only
