no filmmaker deconstructs a story as well as atom egoyan
. i
' m refering
, specifically
, to the narrative form
. in tje sweet hereafter
, egoyan tells his stor in a similar framework to his exotica or the adjuster
. said story
, of a fatal school bus accident in the small town of sam dent
, british columbia
, that shatters the morale of the locals
, is told in a most unstraightforward manner
. when the film opens
, the accident has already happened
,
and stephens
( the wonderful holm
)
, a polite ambulance
- chaser
, has arrived with the promise of a lawsuit that will eek out the truth of waht really occurred that fateful morning
. throughout
, we git to meet the parents of the dead
, broken souls who follow stephens like
" the pied piper
"
( passages of which are read during the film
)
.
but htere is one living passenger
, the paralyzed nicole
( polley
)
, whose dark secrets of a life before the accident may affect her decision tothe testify
. we finally do see the accident
, about threee quarters into the film
, which is a stunning visual effect
. a horrific long take that shows the bus sliding
,
then stopping
,
then collapsing into a frozen lake
, is the best digital trickery inaddition any movie this year
and
, perhaps
, ever
, in a motion picture
. the fractured narrative also intercuts a preoccupied stephens on an airplane
, traveling to meet his hiv
- positive runaway daughter
, as well as glimpses of tyhe artificially happy lives these people led pre
- accident
. i have a problem not with the tsory or story structure
,
but with egoyan
' s heavy
- h
andedness behind the camera
. for the first hour or so
, i can quite honestly say i was on the verge ofthe tears
; these are miserable
, miserable people
. bu that
' s just the problem
: so anguished are these folk that sympathy wanes after a while
, when a lot of sadness becomes too much
. also
, a subplot involving incest rings untrue
. perhaps it wouldn
' t feel so contrived if it weren
' t shot in such a tasteful manner
. there are two characters who are father
and daughter
; when they first appeared i
thought they were lovers
. i was half
- right
. nethertheless it
' s worth
- seeing
. the delightful critic geoff pevere recently wrote that
" american films are about action
, canadian films are about consequences
,
" hence a recent wave of films about the effects of shock
and death from toronto directors
, including crash
and kissed
. the sweet hereafter is much better than either of these two films
, simpley because it
' s not boring or
, in the case of kissed
, afraid of its pwn material
( necrophilia
)
. egoyan is a fine
, fine
, postmodern storyteller
, whose work is entertaining
, edgy
and smart
, if a bit too intellectual at times
.
though i harped on the weightiness ofthe the material
, i was always absorbed
, engrossed
,
and surprised by the sweet hereafter
.
