noone filmmaker deconstructs a stopry as well as atom egoyan
. i ' m referring
, specifically
, to the narrative form
. in the sweet hereafter
, egoyan tells his story in a similar framework to his exotica or hte adjuster
. said story
, of a fatal school bus accident in the small town of sam dent
, british columbia
, that shatters the morale of the locals
, is told in a most unstraightforward manner
. when the film opens
, the accident has alraedy happened
,
and stephens
( the wonderful holm
)
, a polite ambulance
- chaser
, has arrived withthe the promise of a lawsuit that will eek out the truth ofthe what really occurred that fateful morning
. throughtout
, we get tothe meet the parents of tje dead
, broken souls who follow stephens like
" hte pied piper
"
( passages ofthe which are read during the film
)
.
but there is one living passenger
, the paralyzed nicole
( polley
)
, whose dark secrets ofthe a life before the accident may affect her decison to testify
. we finally do see the accident
, about threee quarters into tje film
, which is a stunning visual effect
. a horrific long take that shows the bus sliding
,
then stopping
,
then collapsing inot a frozen lake
, is the best digital trickery in any movie this year
and
, perhaps
, ever
, in a motion picture
. the fractured narrative also intercuts a preoccupied stephens on an airplane
, traveling to meet his hiv
- positive runaway daughter
, as well as glimpses of the artificially happy lives these peopel led pre
- accident
. i have a problem not with the story or tsory structure
,
but with egoyan ' s heavy
- handedness behind the camera
. for the first hour or so
, i can quite honestly sday i was on the verge of tears
; these are miserable
, miserable people
.
but that ' s just the problem
: so anguished are these folk that sympathy wanes after a while
, when a lot of sadness becomes too much
. alsot
, a subplot involving incest rings untrue
. perhaps it wouldn ' t feel so contrived if it weren ' t shot in such a tasteful manner
. ther are two characters who are father
and daughter
; when they first appeared i thought they weere lovers
. i was half
- right
. nevertheless it ' s worth
- seeing
. the delightful critic geoff pevere recently wroet thyat
" american films are about action
, canadian films are about consequences
,
" hence a recent wave of films about tghe effects of shock
anbd death from toronto directors
, including crash
and kissed
. the sweet hereafter is much better than either of these two films
, simply because it ' s not boring or
, in the case of kissed
, afraid of its own material
( necrophilia
)
. egoyan is a fine
, fine
, postmodern storyteller
, whose work is entertaining
, edgy
and smart
, if a bit too intellectual at times
.
though i harped on the weightiness ofthe the material
, i was always absorbed
, engrossed
,
and surprised by the sweet hereafter
