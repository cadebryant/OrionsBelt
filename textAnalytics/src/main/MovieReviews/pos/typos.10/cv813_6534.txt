. this is director tim burton
' s finest film to date
. many will compare this tale of martians who invade earth to independence day
,
but even
though tyhe stories are similar
, they really are two distinctly different films
.
however as a whole
, mars attacks is much more entertaining than id4
,
and i loved id4
. you really have to be in the right frame ofthe mind to enjoy this film
. it is completely wacked
- out
and unlike anything ytou
' ve ever seen
. once the silly tone of the film is set
, it
' s easy to just sit back
and throw logic out the window because logic
and comedy just don
' t mix
. the plot is simple
: martians invade the earth
.
but it
' s different than any other invasion film
. ususally it
' s the evil aliens versus the heroic humans
. this time
however
, it
' s the goofy aliens versus the equally goofy humans
. thge martians
, who are all computer generated
, are just about the funniest thigns i
' ve seen in a long time
. they look funny
, they move funny
,
and their
" language
" is hilarious
. anbd about tghe special effects
. thte effects in mars attacks
! are just about the most flawless ones i
' ve seen to date
. the computer animation ofthe the martians combined with the goofy personalities they are given makse them seem 100
% real
. there are just a couple ofthe scenes that don
' t work
, mainly thsoe involving sarah jessica parker
and pierce brosnan on board an alien ship
. also
, glenn close overacts tremendously in her
( thankfully
) very limited screen time
, so much so that i actually applauded silently when her character meets her demise
.
but there are many big laughs in the film
, as i said
, if you are in the right mood
. could it have been funnier
? certainly
. was it funny enough
? yes
. was i entertained
? absolutely
. on a personal note
, i
' d like to thank whomever cast rod steiger
( my favorite actor
) in the film as war
- crazy general decker
. finally
, after many very small parts in direct to video garbage
and minor tv roles
, steiger is back on the big screen in a rela movie that many people wiull see
. hwile he
' s not given the type of role that yuo can give a rela
" performance
" in
, he does the job well
and has some ogod lines of dialogue
. tjhe preview audience i saw the film with really seemed to enjoy him
.
