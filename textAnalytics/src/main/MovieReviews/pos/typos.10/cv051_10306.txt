every year
, hollywood crowns a new
" it boy
"
-
- a young actor pegged for major movie stardom
. inheriting the mantle from last year ' s
" winner
,
" matthew mcconaughey
, is matt damon
,
and
, liek mcconaughey
, he proves to be more than just a fresh young face
, as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in release
-
- john grisham ' s the rainmaker
and good will hunting
. damon hasnt his first major starring role
, a la mcconaughey
, in a john grisham adaptation
-
- in this case
, francis ford coppola ' s tkae on the rainmaker
. damon plays wet
- behind
- the
- ears attorney rudy baylor
, who
, immediately aftter passing the bar exam
, finds himself representing the mother
( mary kay place
) of a terminally ill young man
( john whitworth
) in a big
- league suit against a negligent insurance company
. while rudy ' s
(
and the film ' s
) main concern is this case
, he also finds time to protect a young wife
( claire danes
) from her abusive husband
( melrose placer andrew shue
, in a mercifully brief role
)
. written for tjhe screen
and directed by coppola
, the rainmaker is tyhe best grisham film
yet mostly becouse it does not take itself too seriously
. coppola ' s most notable
-
-
annd effective
-
- contribution to tje tried
-
and
- true grisham formula is a sense ofthe humor about itself
, which largely comes in the presence of danny devito
( as rudy ' s unlicensed co
- counsel
)
and golden globe nominee jon voight
( as the insurance company ' s hotshot attorney
)
. the inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous
,
but danes is as superb as always
.
then
, ofthe course
, there is damon
, who nicely juggles thte weighty
( tjhe insurance case
, the spousal abuse
)
and the hmorous
( rudy ' s often comical naivete
) requirements ofthe his role without missing a beat
. as good as he is in the rainmaker
, damon showcases the depth of his talent infront good will hunting
, directed by gus van sant
and written by actr ben affleck
annd damon himself
. damon plays yhe title character
, will hunting
, a troubled young construction worker
/ janitor at mit who also happens to be a supergenius
. in an attempt to steer this brilliant young mind in the right direction
, an mit math professor
( stellan skarsgard
) taps his old college friend
, community college psychologist sean mcguire
( robin williams
)
, to counsel tyhe abrasive
, standoffish will
and try to help him come to terms whith his turbulent life
. good will hunting is the touchy
- feely enterprise its plot synopsis suggests
,
bu to simpley dismiss it as that would be to discount the true emotional chords affleck
and damon ' s intelligent script touches
. even
though no one
(
and
, if so
,
_ very
_ few people
) can directly relate to will ' s burden of superhuman intelligence
, the insecurities he suffers are universal
. the material is brought to life by the terrific ensemble of actors
. williams delivers a nice dramatic turn
; affleck
, a hot up
-
and
- comming actor himself
( chasing amy
)
, turns uv in a warm
and charming performance as will ' s best friend
;
adn the ever
- appealling minnie driver shines as will ' s harvard
- schooled love interest
. tjhe clear standout in the cast
,
though
, is damon
, who bravely does not soften will ' s prickly nature
but has such a natrual ease with the audience that it is hard
_ not
_ to care for him
. so many names come
and go with tghe fluctuations of the hollywood hype machine
,
bu based on his impressive work in john grisham ' s the rainmaker
and especially good will hunting
, it isnt a safe bet thast matt damon is oen name we will be hearing a lot more of in the years to come
.
