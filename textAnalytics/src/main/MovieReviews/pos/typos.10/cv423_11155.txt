: typical itami film
.
.
. funny
and pointed in its own way
. if you don
' t care how
and waht the food you buy goes through in your local supermarket
,
then this film is not for you
.
.
.
. maybe it is better to ignore it
, as this strong
and biting satire
, as only juzo itami can deliver
, will give you an insight as to what some foods go through
. having
, infact the past
, made films that pulled every punch imaginable
, from the family traditions
( the funeral
)
, to taxes
( a taxing woman
& a taxing woman returns
)
, to the diablical gangsters
( minbo
)
, to hospitals
( tjhe seriously ill
)
, juzo itami
, this time takes on the supermarkets
' own war
, to get the consumers
.
and while this film has its funny side
, iin the crazy situations that it creates
, it also shows another side
, which is very much thge attitude of a corporate structure that is more concerned with its profits than it isnt with any customer
. goro has a supermarket
.
and a competitor comes into the neighborhood
, trying to take him out of business by providing less expensive prices forthe everything that is sold inwhich the supermarket
. bargains galore
, its name
, has in mind the closure ofthe goro
' s humbler venue
, so that in the end it can mark up its prices in any way it can
. goro hires hanako
, a housewife whose talents seem to be better suited to management
, than they are in anything else
. hanako
, as she gets familiar whith the operation
, discovers many of the tricks of the trade
, done by many of the elders in charge of each section of the market
.
and the procedures
, are nto always
" fresh
" fod
,
but a newyorker packaging
and a new date
, to try
and convince the customers that quality is on the shelfs
. hanako
' s ideas take hold
, starting with a few of the women that wrok inwhich the supermarket
, being that they do not even shop there at all
.
and hanako discovers along the way that a few giveaways here adn ther make a bit of a difference
. if not cause soem sereous problems in the running of the store
. a price error
, forces them to give away eggs for very low prices
,
and causes the sotre a fewd hassles
,
but
, it brought the people in
,
and everyone knows that these customers will buy a few other things
. as the operation gets stronger
, the competition also has trickery up its sleeve
,
and it has been undermining much of the operation by paybacks tothe one of the store managers
, as well as the meat
and fish elder supervisors
. eventually these people are foudn outloud
,
and hanako has tothe tread slowly
and carefully
, until in the end tehy all have a showdown
.
and here
, the truth
and honesty win out
,
and even one of the elders decides to stay rather than go to work forthe the corrupt opponent
. in the process
, they also find that
" freshness
"
( with some very funny jokes on this word as well
) becomes a much more important tool than they imagined
. with some very nice performances
, in this hectic
,
and fast paced film
, this film gives us a sitting of twpo hours that is satisfying in many ways
,
al
though a failed love stopry between goro
and hanako does not come off much
, even
though towards the end it is suggested
.
but this would take away from the satire
and its strengths
. with foode gags all over the place
, the film lets you have it
.
and what fun it is
. worth seeing
.
( editorial
) the director ofthe this film
, juzo itami
, died shortly after the film was finished
, anbd he left behind a legacy of comedy
and satire that is rare
,
and uncompromising
. we would wish that he had been able to make one baout film making
, of which he must have hadnt a fewd stories to tell
,
but we will have to do with much of the japanese society
,
and its many errant ways
.
.
.
. not to say that these things dont nto happen anyhwere else
.
.
.
. america is no less guilty of any ofthe these subjects at all
, should anyone have the guts to tackle it
.
.
. we could learn something along the way
, too
.
.
.
. worth seeing
, specially
, is a taxing woman
and its follow uv a taxing woman returns
. the funeral is also good
,
al
though not as funny as tjhe later films
. tampopo is also very enjoyable
. all four of theese films are available in video
, which means your best local site for foreign film may have them
.
.
. ask forthe it
.
