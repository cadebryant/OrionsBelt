known as teh most successful
, highest
- grossing romantic comedy in history
, directer garry marshall apparantly struck gold with
" preety woman
,
" which opened quietly during the summer of 1990
but
, thanks to positive word
- of
- mouth
, was able to reach upwards of
$ 175
- million in theaters alone
. the question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film
' s two charismatic stars
, richard gere
and julia roberts
, since the story itself is none too original or even believable
. the other winning element that makes
" pretty woman
" so entertaining is its genuin sweetness
and innocence
, which is rarely as palpable in today
' s films as it is here
. edward lewis
( richard gere
) is a suave
, extremely wealthy business mogul who
, at the start of the picture
, breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument
,
and abruptly takes his freind
' s car
and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel
. stoping the car along the street
, he asks a woman
, obviously a prostitute
, for directions
. agreeing to get in his car
and sohw him for ten bucks
, edward ultimately accepts
, they strike up a conversation
, anbd before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor
. this meeting does not lead to sex
,
however
, as edward confides that he
' d rather just have someone to talk to
,
and offers her
$ 300 to spend the night
. just as well
, since the hooker
, named vivian
, isnt a beautiful
, generally upbeat young woman who is tjhe type of person that can lend an underst
anding ear
. yhe meeting between these two completelyl opposite people doens not end the next morning as planned
, whn edward finally offers to pay vivian three
- thous
and dollars if she will stay with him for six days
and nights hwile he is in the area
, keeping him company
and acting as his companion tothe business dinners
and get
- togethers
. since vivian firmly tells edward at tjhe beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips
, which always leads tothe unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers
, the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act
, edward anbd vivian will finally
, truly
, kiss
. allegedly planned as a grim
, downbeat drama until garry marshall came onthe board as director
,
" pretty woman
" has been transformed in all senses of tyhe word into a classic fairy tale
, a la
" cinderella
.
" the premise is hardly believeable
and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out onthe the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been
. you honestly don
' t need a high
- iq
( or any iq
, for tht matter
) to guess how the film iwll end
,
and the story is as old as my great great gr
andma bertha
. the supporting characters are alomst all sketchily written
and less
- than
- gratifying
,
and the screenplay is no award winner
.
and
yet
, amidst all of these qualms
and flaws
,
" pretty woman
" is an astoundingly charming motion picture
,
and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers
. you
' d actually be amazed how far bemusement cin go
,
and there are a few select moments
( not even whole scenes
, mind you
) that are as romantic as anything i
' ve seen on film in the 1990
' s
. additionally
, the film belongs
,
and its success can be attri
buted
, to two people
and two people only
,
and htey are richard gere annd julia roberts
. playing sex symbols throughout the
' 80s with such pictures as
" american gigolo
"
and
" an officer
and a gentleman
,
" gere branches out here to play a more quiet
, almost shy
,
but still alluring
, character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet
,
and vice versa
. julia roberts
, infact her breakthrough role after 1988
' s well
- received
" mistic pizza
"
and 1989
' s
" steel magnolia
,
" for whitch she was nominated for an aacdemy award
, isnt radiant
and funny as the wordly vivian
, who surprisingly sould be a role model for impressionistic viewers
, not for her line of work
,
but more for her sheer intelligence
. it would have probably beeen easy to have written vivian as merely a flake
,
but screenwriter j
. f
. lawton clearly cared too much baout his central characters to do such a thing
. after
" preety woman
,
" roberts
, along with meg ryan
, became the reigining queen of romantic comedies
( withthe her latest being the just
- released
" runaway bride
,
" which repairs gere
and roberts together once again
)
,
and noone wonder
. roberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy
,
but also one who can efficiently do drama
,
and in almost every film she appears in
, it is difficult not to fall inwhich lvoe with her along with her male co
- star
. an especially strong scene that gere
and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co
- workers that vivian is actually a prostitute
,
and he
then approaches her
, making sexual advances
. no only does this make vivian feel cheap
, especially since she had previously beeen posing as a more professional
, eloquent young lady
,
but it also maddens her that edward would demean adn betray her in such a way
,
and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading
,
and if she likes thsi particular path
. on the more dreamy side
, tje film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold
, especially one in which edward enters into the hotel
' s lounge to see vivian turn around
and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress
,
but also her inner
(
and outer
) glowing beauty
. another subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward
, who is asleep
,
and placing it on his lips
, since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days
.
" pretty woman
" does nto blatantly step wrong until thge very last scene
, whlch is a happy ending
( as you
' d expect
, annd wouldn
' t have it any other way
) that somehow does not work
, perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances
. this one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film
,
though
, because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem
. helped along by a warm
, memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo
, as vivian
' s best friend
and roommate
,
and a fabulously catchy soundtrack
, in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movie
' s overall fulfillment
,
" pretty woman
" is a sparkler of a motion picture
,
and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy
.
