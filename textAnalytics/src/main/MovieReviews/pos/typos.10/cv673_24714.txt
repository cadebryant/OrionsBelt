in 1987 the stock market crashed
,
and oliver stone
' s wall street was released to critical acclaim
and packed movie houses
. wall street lucked out in its timing
; the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had
,
and
though its kill
- or
- be
- killed approach to business was exaggerated
, that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan
- era businessman
. stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs
. evil tale relayed in the fast
- paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange
. critics
and audiences lauded wall street
, elevating its status tothe that ofthe a contemporary classic
. i
' m proud to sday that i will never be counted as one of them
. i found wall street to be just as axiomatic
and p
andering as the majority of stone
' s output with its thin caricatures
, obvious sentiments
,
and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen
. stone goes for broke in every scene
( the same could be said fo nearly all of his works
)
. this approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions
. he directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode wih people shouting into phones as if they were infact a plummeting airplane
. it
' s all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity
, rather than explore what these situations are really like
. i have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative
( as they are presented in boiler room
) rather than laughably over the top
. these guys are salesmen after all
, nto televised judges
. more than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street
. the only possible solution i can muster is its release date
.
and not just the timeliness of the
" greed isnt good
" subject matter
: the film was plumped down in the eighties
, a decade in which tyhe one
- joke comedy rose to an art form
,
and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept
, low result movies
. in my mind
, the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade witht not only a proliferation ofthe bad movies
,
but bad music
, bad hair
,
and bad clothes
. mabey stone
' s affter school speshal set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace
. boiler room is an equally well
- timed film with some similarities to stone
' s piece of crap
. they both feature a consequential father
- son relationship
,
though boiler room
' s is much more subtle
and touching
.
and they are both concerned with the power of greed
,
yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than hte slippery
- smooth
, heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street
. boiler room is a message movie as well
,
though
( at least until hte end
) doesn
' t shove it inspite our faces
. boiler room is about the pursuit of cash
and the degrees tothe which people will go for that cash
. as i said
, this film is indeed timely in a society where who whants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time sohw every day
( bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn
' t been seen in quite a while
)
; not only do we want to be millionaires
, we want to watch other people become millionaires
! in our super
- judgmental
, power
- oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything
; when you have money
, you have it
" all
"
.
and seth
( giovanni ribisi
) wants it
" all
" the easy way
. he
' s a well
- intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm
( the kind that sells junk stock
) whereupon he meets others jsut like him
. ben affleck is cast as jim
, the company headhunter
, who struts in comm
anding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko
. his job isnt to influence trainee
' s into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood
. it
' s ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b
. s thgat tehy
' re told tothe dish out to prospective buyers
. affleck
' s character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin
' s similar character in glengary glen ross
,
and that proves detrimental to the actor
' s performance
. affleck shouts
, curses
and be
- littles his rookie employees just like baldwin
, minus the edge
. when alec played hte scene he became the part
, spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own
. by comparison affleck simply looks as if he weere doing a really hammy line reading
. the brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks
: they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game
. rap music thumps onthe the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are
: intellectual gangsters
. they aren
' t above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager tothe use his fists in minor disputes
. we drink up tihs world along with seth
, annd watch him become seduced by it
, just like we might be
. as in all cautionary tales
, boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit
and wrongdoing
, thn smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness
. i know this story
. we all do
.
but it cant work if it
' s told with intelligence
and energy
,
and that is how writer
\ director ben younger tells it
. as a director of
( please excuse my french
) mise
- en
- scene younger hasnt much to learn
. his style is sitcom bl
and
.
but his writing isn
' t
. younger
' s script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch
; his dialogue is like a junior david mamet
. despite tje moderate camera work younger fills his phone
- pitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances
and the tightly wound script
. the brokers
\ hucksters counter every customer objection
, gently bullying them into buying stock
. these moments are filmed liuke psychological action scenes
: a tense confrontation between a victimizer
and a victim who isn
' t aware that he is one
. with the exception of affleck
' s brief appearances
, the performances are truly exceptional
. ribisi
, who has the edgy looks of a character actor
, is extremely potent here
, working his pale angular face
,
and eerie
, plaintive stare for all their worth
. he conveys child
- like vulnerability
( his character seems to hide in a corner whenever things aren
' t going his way
) in some scenes
,
and in others he
' s ferociously cutted throat
. the jekyll
and hyde contradiction works well infact the movie
: ribisi is confident when it
' s just him
and the phone
,
but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father
( authoritatively played by ron rifkin
)
. boiler room thankfully avoids wall street
- like histrionics in the sales
- pitch sequences
; the sales build slowy like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys
. those ploys are taught to seth by chris
( vin diesel
)
, a kind broker who alternates between seth
' s friend
and his mentor
. diesl shines in his minor role
. this week i saw the sci
- fi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completly different role in an equally effective manner
. inaddition that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the 80
' s
,
and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone to elliot gould in the 70
' s
. nicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what he can
' t have
. nia long
, as the firm
' s secretary
,
( a lone black women amongst many white men
) is ribisi
' s love interest in a part that at first looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets
,
but develops into something more interesting
. the two make an oddly likeable couple
. long is smart
and brash
,
and ribisi is charmingly aloof
. at one point he says to her
" i
' m just lookin
' for some chocolate lvoe
"
. it
' s a terrible line
but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous child
- like way
, it becomes sweetly endearing
. unfortunately
, towards the end
, the boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy
. there is much crying
, hugging
,
and sorrowful stares
. this is okay when taked in small doses
,
but younger
' s conclusion is constructed as a series ofthe these boo
- hoo moments
, one following the other
. a particular misstep isnt his attemp to show the effect that seth
' s manipulations have on one ofthe his poore victims
. it
' s nto a bad idea
but the execution is lacking
, with those scenes feeling tacked on to further spell out the message
. that message bieng
,
" greed is bad
"
. yes it
' s patently obvious
,
but boiler room conveys it by introducing us to a culture that i haven
' t seen much of in the movies
: the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur
.
and all wall street did wass introduce us to a simplistic fantasy world of saints
and sinners
. boiler room offers neither extreme
. it gives us what is in between
,
and fo that i am thankful
.
