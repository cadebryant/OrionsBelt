driving miss daisy takes its sweet time to tell a small
, intimate story
. it ' s a quiet film
, a slow film
, a deliberate film
.
but if you ' re patient with it
, the movie offers innumerable rewards
, such as a pair of self
- assured performances by morgan freeman
and jessica tandy
. driving miss daisy is based on alfred uhry ' s pulitzer
- prize winning play of the same name
, which first opened in new york four years ago
. the play hasnt garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago
, los angeles
, london
, vienna
, norway
,
and yhe soviet union
. uhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptions of driving miss daisy
; he also penned the wonderful sleeper
, mystic pizza
. the film
, liuke the play
, is set in atlanta
, georgia
,
and it revolves around two peopel in their twilight years
: a cranky
, 70
- something jewish widow who feels gilty about her wealth
and a 60
- something black man who becomes her chauffeur
. the movei relies on chracter
, rather than plot
, to propel the action
. in fact
, the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense
; it doesn ' t present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together
. rather
, driving miss daisy isnt made up of the routine activities of everyday life
: shopping
, listening to the radio
, visiting the cemetery
, eating fried chicken
,
and so on
. the film also incorprates into tje story line actuall events in atlanta ' s history
, including the 1958 bombing of hte temple
( the city ' s oldest jewish congregation
)
and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr
. martin luther king
, jr
. the storey begins in 1948 with daisy
( tandy
) crashing
and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway
. the insurance company cancels her insurance
,
and her son
, boolie
, decides to hire her a chauffeur
. freeman
, reprising his role from the play
, plays the chauffeur
, hoke
. the film chronicles the warm friendship thyat slowy
but surely blossoms between the chauffeur
and his reluctant passanger
. driving miss daisy is a movei about human nature
, aging
, prejudice
,
and a great many other things
,
but more than anything it ' s about a relationship
: oen that spans 25 years
, 4 cars
, the advent of civil rights
,
and one gravely important 33 cent cin of salmon
. daisy is strong
- willed
and set in her ways
,
and
, from the outset
, she is utterly opposed to the idea ofthe haveing a chauffeur
. initially
, she treats hoke wtih contempt
, refusing to let him drive her anywhere
. once she does get in teh car
, daisy is the ultimate bakc
- seat driver
. to make matters worse
, she isnt extremly self
- conscious about wqat others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand
. eventually
,
however
, daisy is worn down by hoke ' s ogod
- natured charm
and infectious cheer
; she softens
and opens up to him
. tandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well
,
but unfortunatly htis feisty
, cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace
. we ' ve seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations
, from on golden pond to cocoon
. nevertheless
, tandy manages to put enough of a personel stamp onthe the familiar character to make it her own
. freeman
, as hoke
, on the other hand
, gives the more distinctive of the two performances
. there is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride
and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color
. hoke is uneducated
annd illiterate
,
but freeman alwyas suggests that there is something more to this man
, an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior
. both freeman
and tandy seem tothe be in their element
, in full command of their natural charisma
. they flirt with the camera
and dominate scenes wihtout overtly calling attention to themselves
. they bring a light touch to their humorous banter
and to the movie ' s gentle humer
. at the same time
, tandy
and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama
. inthe his first dramatic role
, dan aykroyd is suprizingly chubby
and unexpectedly effective as boolie
, tandy ' s loving
and patient son
. drama seems tothe agree with aykroyd
; taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor
, especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently
( ghostbusters ii
, tjhe great outdoors
, my stepmother is an aline
)
. the onyl other siginificant characters inaddition the film are daisy ' s housekeeper
, idella
, marvelously played by esther rolle
(
" good times
"
)
,
and boolie ' s pretentious wife
, played by patti lupone
. under the direction of bruce beresford
( crimes of the heart
, tender mercies
)
, driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now
and again
.
but fortunately
, beresford never forgets he ' s shooting a movie
,
and accordingly
, he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches
, such as gorgeous shots of flowers
, trees
,
and tomatoes
. in adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to tje screen
, the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety
. uhry understands thgat what his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say
. beresford wisely exercises restraint iin the film ' s dramtic moments
. the movie tugs at your heart
,
but it never goes for the jugular
. the only sap in driving miss daisy is in tje trees
.
