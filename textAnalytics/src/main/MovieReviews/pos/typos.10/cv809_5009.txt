driving miss daisy tkaes its sweet time to tell a small
, intimate story
. it
' s a quiet film
, a slow film
, a deliberate film
.
but if you
' re patient with it
, the movie offers innumerable rewards
, such as a pair of self
- assured performances by morgan freeman
and jessica t
andy
. driving miss daisy is based on alfred uhry
' s pulitzer
- prize winning play of the smae name
, which first opened in new york four years ago
. the play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago
, los angeles
, london
, vienna
, norway
, adn the soviet union
. uhry himselv wroet the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy
; he also penned the wonderful sleeper
, mystic pizza
. the film
, like the play
, is set inaddition atlanta
, georgia
,
and it revolves around two people inspite their twilight years
: a cranky
, 70
- something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth
and a 60
- something black man who becomes her chauffeur
. the movie relies on character
, rather than plot
, to propell the action
. in fact
, the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense
; it doesn
' t present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together
. rather
, driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life
: shopping
, listening tothe the radio
, visiting the cemetery
, eating fried chicken
,
and so on
. the film alsot incorprates into the story line actual events in atlanta
' s history
, including the 1958 bombing of the temple
( tghe city
' s oldest jewish congregation
)
and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr
. martin luther king
, jr
. the story begins in 1948 with daisy
( t
andy
) crashing
and wrecking her packard as she puls out of her driveway
. thte insurance company cancels her insurence
,
and her son
, boolie
, decides to hire her a chauffeur
. freeman
, reprising his role from the play
, plays the chauffeur
, hoke
. the film chronicles the warm friendship thyat slowly
but surely blossoms between the chauffeur adn his reluctant passenger
. driving miss daisy is a movie about human nature
, aging
, prejudice
,
and a great many other things
,
but more than anything it
' s about a relationship
: oen that spans 25 years
, 4 cars
, the advent of civil rights
,
and oen gravely important 33 cent cxan of salmon
. daisy is strong
- willed anbd set in her ways
, anbd
, from the outset
, she is utterly opposed to the idae of having a chauffeur
. initally
, she treats hoke with contempt
, refusing to let him drive her anywhere
. once she does get in the car
, daisy is the ultimate back
- seat driver
. tothe make matters worse
, she is extremely self
- conscous about whta others might think if they were to see her being escorted arround town by a hired h
and
. eventually
,
however
, daisy is worn down by hoke
' s good
- natured charm
and infectuous cheer
; she softens
and opens up to him
. t
andy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well
,
but unfortunately this feisty
, cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace
. we
' ve seen tihs woman countless times before in other incarnations
, from on golden pond to cocoon
. nevertheless
, t
andy manages to put enough of a personal stamp onthe the familiar character to amking it her own
. freeman
, as hoke
, on the otehr h
and
, gives the more distinctive of the two performances
. there is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his prade annd dignity inaddition a society which forbids him from using publich rest rooms because of his skin colour
. hoke is uneducated
and illiterate
,
but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man
, an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior
. both freeman adn t
andy seem to be inspite their element
, infact full comm
and ofthe their natural charisma
. they flirt with the camera
and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention tothe themselves
. tehy bring a light touch tothe their humorous banter
and to the movie
' s gentle humor
. at thte same time
, t
andy
and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama
. in his first dramtic role
, dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby
and unexpectedly effective as boolie
, t
andy
' s loving
and patient son
. drama seems to agree with aykroyd
; taking a break from comedy seems like a ogod move for the actor
, especially when yuo consider the wretched comedies he has made recently
( ghostbusters ii
, teh great outdoors
, my stepmother is an alien
)
. the only other significant characters in the film are daisy
' s housekeeper
, idella
, marvelously played by esther rolle
(
" good times
"
)
,
and boolie
' s pretentious wife
, played by patti lupone
. under the direction of bruce beresford
( crimes of the heart
, tender mercies
)
, driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now
and again
.
but fortunately
, beresford never forgets he
' s shooting a movei
,
and accordingly
, he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches
, such as gorgeous shots of flowers
, trees
,
and tomatoes
. in adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen
, the filmmakers ahve achieved a delicate subtlety
. uhry underst
ands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what htey do say
. beresford wisely exercises restraint in the film
' s dramatic moments
. the movie tugs at your heart
,
but it never goes for the jugular
. the only sap in driving miss daisy is in the trees
.
