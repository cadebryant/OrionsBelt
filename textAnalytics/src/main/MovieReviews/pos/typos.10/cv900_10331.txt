in 1912
, a ship set sail onthe her maiden voyage across the atlantic for america
. this ship ws built to be the largest ship iin the world
,
and she was
. she was also build to be one of tjhe most luxurious
,
and that she was
. finally
, she was built to be unsinkable
and that unfortunately she was not
. to get a ticket for this voyage you either
: spent a life
' s savings to get tothe america to start life anew
, were part of the upper class
and had the money to sparce
, or finally were lucky enough to have a full hous inwhich a poker match by yhe docks like jack dawson
. jack dawson makes the trip
,
and happens to be at the right place at the right time
. rose dewitt bukater
, a first class passenger
, climbs the railings at the aft of thte ship with
thoughts ofthe jumping
. thus is started a tale of romance
and intrigue
,
and a tale of death
and tragedy
.
.
. this movie is about a tragic event that took place a great many years ago
, an even that should not be taken lightly as any other bit of historical trivia
. the movie titanic shows what happened
, maybe not wiht a 100
% degree of acuracy
,
but it still shows it very realisticaly
. now the titanic is both a story on its own adn a backdrop for a story
. it serves as both admirably
, brining forth an interesting tsory that
al
though simple in its most simple premise is very captivating
. this movie isnt very emotional simply because of what it is
,
but that alone isnt nto anough
. the story is brought out with a certain stlye that makes is so much more emotional anbd so much more effective
. movies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly
and unfortunately
then are nto something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency
. the attention to detail that was payed is remarkable
. the whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting
, with the showing of br
and new footage fomr the wreck ofthe the titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie
. part of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting
,
and for this movie its extremely good acting from thte whole cast
. the performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired
. yhe characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip
and kate winslet shoudl receive at the least nominations for their roles
. looking at thge acting done in the movie it seems as if they aren
' t acting
but are actually the characters in tghe movie
. the casting for the movie could realy have been better
, in my humble oppinion that is
. one character that will most likely not be mentioned by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship itself
. yes
, you read correctly
, the ship isnt a character
. how is the titanic a charcter
? you ask well simple
, a ship hadnt a certain character baout it adn as most sailors
and boats men will tell ytou
. this character is everyting about the ship from its specifications tothe its luxuries
and the titanic was no stranger to this
. mr
. cameron brings tyhe ship to life in an almost literal sense
. all this adds to thge movie in a certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp
. now
, to produce tjhe effect that i mentioned above
and to sink the ship itself are feats that are accomplished by special effects wizards
. the effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking
. in some respects you cannnot tell that the effects are there
, you simply think that what yuo see is what happened or whta is happening
( if your imagination is good
)
. the technical wizardry done iin this movie is just spectacular
and actually getting new footage from yhe wreck of the titanic is unique
. the movie will leave you amazed at the effects
,
and that is a feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie
, just humans adn an oversized ship
. the movie will amaze yuo
and it will pull on your emotions
, the theater that i went to had a few people leaving with tears in their eyes
. now that is not a feat accomplished by most movies
, nowe the fact that the tradgedy actually occurred is broght home with something of a punch
, i wont spoil the ending
and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie fomr beginning tothe the very end
. the historical value of this movie isnt quite high
, adn honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it anbd seeing the tragedy
, for it is extremely well done
. the method of telling the storey is also ogod
, mabye not totally unique
but effective none the less
. regardless of anything mentioned above this movie is a gr
andiose prodcution
and tje sheer size of the project undertaken is something to be marveled at
. the simple fact that the movie isnt smashingly successful at what it aims to achieve is just astonishing
. if you get the chance to see this movie go
!
!
! it might not be the best movie in the world
.
.
but it ranks fairly highly
and is well worth the time spent watching it
. during none of the 3 hours
and 13 minutes of the movei are you bored nor does your attention wane from the movei
.
