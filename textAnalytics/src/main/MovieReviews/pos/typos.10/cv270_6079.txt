though tyhe film starts out on a comic note
, it tkaes a sharp term in the middle
,
and becomes almost depressing
. the film is based on an irving welsh novel bearing the smae title
. i can honestly say that this is one of the best movies i ahev ever seen
. it is an obscure gem that has been over shadowed in the us by such movies as mission impossible
and id4
. the film is hard to follow with the heavy accents of the actors
. tihs is a very original film
, as far as films go today
. it definetly deserves multiple viewings
( partly because of the slang
and accents
