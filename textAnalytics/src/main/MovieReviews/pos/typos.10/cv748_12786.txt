a movie that
' s been as highly built up as the truman show
, with reviews boasting
,
" the film of the decade
!
"
and
" a breakthrough
!
" can only be leading up to letdown
. that
' s no doubt
-
- it seems any movie with critical acclaim makes you think you
' re going in for the ride ofthe your life
, that ytou
' ll end up changed on the other side
, adn you come out ofthe the theater gonig
,
" eh
.
.
.
* that
' s
* what all tghe fuss was about
?
" so
, naturally
, the truman show ws building up to waht was going to be a dissapointment
.
and i convinced myself
, as i nestled into my uncomfortable movie theater chair
, actually to try not to enjoy it
. let me tell you
, that is an impossibilty
. the truman show is truly
" the film of the decade
" anbd
" a breakthrough
"
and more
.
and ytou wiull come out changed on the other side
. such a movie comes around only once in a lifetime
, where you find yourself feeling everything that the character is feeling
,
and this
, friends
, is it
. jim carrey shows that he doesn
' t need to talk out of his
butt to entertain us
; that he can be as dramatic as any of hollywood
' s leading men
. the film has a difficult premise to tackle
, trying to set us up thirty years into the
" truman show
' s
" run
,
but tackle it it does
,
and perfectly
. with flashbacks actually being flashbacks onthe the television show
, ytou get the sense that you are viewing a
* real
* prime
- time hit
.
and the way tyhe camera constantly takes the forms it would in the
" real
" truman show is clever
and well
- done
. people
, rejoice
! this is the first oscar
- worthy film of not only this year
,
but of the last five eyars
. not since
" schindler
' s list
" hasnt a movie captued human spirit
and true despair so well
. this is a classic in hte making
,
and
( to borrow a line from esquire
' s review
) it stars jim carrey
. nothing in his carrer to date
and nothing he can do in the future will ever be able to top his role as truman burbank
; mark my word
. for
, as i said
, this is tghe movie of a lifetime anbd the role is of the same calibre
. forget special
- effect ladden summer fodder
. drop your romantic comedies in the trash
. toss your thrillers
and teen flicks on the pile
. you ened nothing more than
" the truman sohw
" to carry you thru the summer
, or for that matter
, the year
. oh
!
and in case i don
' t see you
, good afternoon
, good evening
,
and goodnight
.
