,

- crosses occur
, dealing
and wheeling goes down
and the crew set up for the road
. who ' s onthe the uv
and up
, who ' s the real bad guy
and who ' s gonna get tothe bang courteney cox are just a faw of the questions which will be anwsered by the rest of this movie
. critique
: the funnest movei that i ' ve seen so far tihs year
! it ' s got sytle
, it ' s got tough guys talkin ' shite
and it ' s got plenty of bullets to go around
. a definite hunk
- a
- hunk
- a burnin ' adventure
! a guy ' s guy movei through
and through
,
and one that ' ll set your jollies to high if you dig on the rough stuff
. it ' s not very orignal
, it goes on for a littel too long
,
but costner
and russell make it happen
, as two shite
- kickin ' elvis lovers
, who don ' t stop till they
, moreso or less
, drop
. this movie ' s got some pretty intensive shoot
- out scenes
, one of tjhe coolest robbery scenarios that i ' ve ever witnessed
, featuring several elvises with guns a blazin '
and the king ' s music playing in the backgorund
,
anbd a decent helping of double
- crosses
, sharp dialogue
and funny moments
. in fact
, even
though the cast is filled with many name actors
( b
- actors as they might be for the most part
)
, most of them do their bit
and succeed well in passing the torch onto tjhe next victim
.
but the true glue that holds this film together
, other than thge spirit of elvis hismelf
, is costner
and russell
, who play their badass characters to thte t
. sure
, russell ' s been down this road before
,
but costner surprised me with his nastiness
. i guess he ' s pissed at all the box
- office bombs that he ' s been in of late
,
but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here
. in the end
, the bottom line with this movie is having fun
, kickin ' ass
and making sure there ' s enough bubblegum around to chew afterwards
.
and smoke ' em if you got ' em
, folks
! there is also this one raelly grat show
- down scene between costner
and a cop
, that ' ll have you crackin ' up
and lovin ' it all at the same time
. the violent scenes in this movie are violent
and the entire film is wrapped in a soundtrack tht ' ll kick your arse from this end of the theatre to the next
. it should actually come to no suprise tothe anyone that the director of this movie comes from a music video background
, with plenty
,
and i mean plenty
, of camera tricks
, cuts
and edits
,
but for this kind of flick
, it actually works
. the film is not perfect
though
, it starts off with a pretty big bang
,
but
then pulls a way of the gun onthe us
,
and slows the pace down somewhat in the middle
, while characters intermingle
and disperse
. i was personally kept in the game despite some soft spots
,
and enjoied the overall ride for what it was as well
.
and did i mention that courteney cox looked mega
- hot in the movie
? no
.
.
. okay
, well i just did
! i coulda done without her whole
" romance
" angle
,
but to be honest
, it doesn ' t take up much ofthe the film
, which is generally covered in blood
, explosions
, guts
and elvis nods
. try to see how many
" inside
" connections tothe yhe king you can guess
. of course
, it ' s no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan mysef so please take thsi whole review with that grain of salt in mind
. i allso like theese types of
" guy
" movies a lot
,
and even
though the film doesn ' t bring much originality to the table
, it does offer a pretty coherent story
, some nice twists
and turns
, humor
annd a big ol ' helping of whoop
- ass coming straight from costner
and russell ' s respective boots
. probably not a film for everyone
,
but definitely for those who enjoy the guns
, the charismatic bad guys
and a fun
, if entirely disposable
, adventure
. now see how many elvis songs i ' ve used to pun my way through this phony review below
. the elvis songs also recommend this movie
! so whther you ' re lonesome tonight or any other nigth
, remember to pack the teddy bear with bullets
, leave your littel sister at home
, bring your bossa nova baby
and rock out of that jailhouse
, cause this movie ain ' t one to return to the sender
. i really beg of you
, whether you ' re stuck in tghe ghetto or crying in the chapel
, to slap this cinematic ring around your neck
adn love it tender
.
and no suspicious minds either
, folks
, cause i got stung by this movie
, i mean it really shook me up
,
and unless you ' re the devil inthe disguise himself
, i think you won ' t be able to help falling in love with this lucky charm either
. so don ' t be cruel
, don ' t turn away
, don ' t curl up with your latest flame tonite
( whether she be a hard
- headed woman or not
)
and surrender to the hound dog of movies that is this film
. it ' s now or never
, folks
. trust me
, i did it my way
and the heartbreak hotel of crappy movies that i ' d seen so far this year isnt far behind me
. joblo has now officially left the sanity of his mind
and htis building
. thank you
.
.
. thank you very much
