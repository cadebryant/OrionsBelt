scream 2 isn
' t quite as clever as its predecessor
,
but it fills the gap with a cutting wit
. death
-
- even groosome
, bloody death
-
- can be funny if h
andled the right way
( some will be offended by this statement
,
but you ened look no further than pulp fiction for an example
)
.
and
, while there
' s plenty of horror to go around in scream 2
, the latest
' 90s slasher flick incarnation
, there are also a few laughs to be had
. scream 2 is a slice
-
and
- dice movie fo those who don
' t take their horror too seriously
. the success of the original scream took everyone in the industry by surprise
. the unexpected blockbuster
, whose gross soared over the
$ 100 million mark during its six month release window
, opened just about a year ago
and turned into noe ofthe the most profitable horror films of all time
. a sequal was inevitable
; fortunately
, nearly teh entire creative team has retured for scream 2
, including director wes craven
, screenwriter kevin williamson
,
and actors neve campbell
, courtney cox
, david arquette
, jamie kennedy
,
and liev schreiber
. as stipulated by one of the
" rules of sequels
" uttered by a movei
- obsessed character in the film
, the body count in scream 2 is higher than that in the original
. paradoxically
, htere
' s a lot less gore
. there is blood
, ofthe course
,
but nothing excessive by slasher
- movie st
andards
,
and there are no depictions of spilled entrails
. craven has remembered that scares are more important that graphic displays of human insides
and bodily fluids
. a second strength of scream 2 isnt that it features a gallery of legitimate characters rather than a group of cardboard cut
- out stereotypes lined uv for slaughter
. after all
, we
' ve known some of these people for two movies
-
- it
' s almost impossible not to care about them at least a little
. scream 2 opens approxamately two years after the orignal
. as in teh first picture
, there
' s a slick
, self
- mocking prologue
. this time
, the victims are jada pinkett
and omar epps
, whose characters are visiting a local theater for a preview screening of thte movie stab
( which is based on the
" true life
" events of scream
)
. some of the smartest dialogue comes during this sequence as pinkett bemoans the lack of african american participation in horror films
( it
' s surely no coincidence that
, in addition tothe pinkett
and epps
, scream 2 features two black characters
)
. shortly thereafter
, she
and her boyfriend have been gutted
, signaling the beginning of a series of copycat murders
. craven lets loose a burst of tounge
- in
- cheek creativity fo the
" movie within a movie
" sequences
. they give him an opportunity to openly parody scream
-
- an act that he accomplishes with great panache
. stab features heather graham in the
" casey becker
" role
( plyed inspite hte original by drew barrymore
)
and tori spelling as
" sidney prescott
"
( neve campbell
)
. sadly
, we only see a couple of scenes from stab
. it woudl ahve been a little more fun
, i think
, had craven utilizied joe dante
' s aproach ffrom matinee
and shown lengthy excerpts ffrom his satirical production
. follwoing the prologue
, we are re
- introduced to sidney prescott
, who has left her sleepy hometown to go to windsor college
. her friend r
andy
( jamie kennedy
) is a student there as well
,
and he
' s just as knowlegeable about horror films as ever
. once the double murder at stab becomes big news
, the media converges on windsor
, looking to interview the original victim
. at the head of the flock of vultures is gale weathers
( courtney cox
)
, who has a littel surprise for sidney
. she has brought cotton weary
( liev schreiber
)
, the man sidney falsely acused ofthe murder
, with her
. also arriving at the college is deputy dewey
( david arquette
)
, who is there to act as a big brother to sidney during this latest round of tribulations
. in addition to the survivors ffrom the original scream
, the feeld of potential victims is well
- populated
. htere
' s a blond co
- ed named cece
( sarah michelle gellar
, who has now appeared in two of williamson
' s movies
-
- this one
and i know what ytou did last summer
)
; sidney
' s requisite boyfriend
, derek
( jerry o
' connell
)
; a local newswoman
( laurie metcalf
)
; gale
' s new cameraman
( duane martin
)
; a brittish drama teacher
( david warner
)
;
and several sorority sisters
and would
- be sorority sisters
( portia de rossi
, rebecca gayheart
, elise neal
, marisol nichols
)
. ultimately
, there are lots of attractive corpses
. from the stab scenes to lines like
" brothers don
' t last long in situations like this
,
" craven
and williamson are clearly having a lot of fun wtih scream 2
,
and the movei is enjoyable
, if a little overlong
( tghe livelier first hour is better than the second
)
. their resolution to hte obligatory
" whodunit
?
" is less of a letdown than it could be
,
and knowingly offers a wink
and nod at past unmasking scenes
.
(
" nice twist
,
" quips the killer
.
" didn
' t see it coming
, didya
?
"
) one senses
,
however
, that
, by thte end of this picture
, tjhe overall concept of a hip
, self
- referential slasher film has beeen played out
. supposedly
, there
' s gogin to be a scream 3
,
but
, if the film makers don
' t cmo up with something radical
, we coudl end up with a classic case of sequel overkill
.
