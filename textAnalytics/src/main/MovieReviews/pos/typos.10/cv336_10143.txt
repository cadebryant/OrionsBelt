scream 2 isn ' t quite as clever as its predecessor
,
but it fills the gap with a cutting wit
. death
-
- even gruesome
, bloody death
-
- cxan be funny if handled the right way
( some will be offended by this statement
,
but you need look noone further than pulp fiction for an example
)
.
and
, while there ' s plenty of horror to go around in scream 2
, the latest ' 90s slasher flick incarnation
, there are also a few laughs to be had
. scream 2 is a slice
-
and
- dice movie for those who don ' t take their horror too seriously
. the success of the original scream took everyone in the industry by surprise
. the unexpected blockbuster
, whose gross soared over the
$ 100 million mark durring its six month release window
, opened just baout a year ago
and turned into one of the most profitable horror films of all tiome
. a sequel was inevitable
; fortunatly
, nearly the entire creative team has returned for scream 2
, including director wes craven
, screenwriter kevin williamson
,
and actors neve campbell
, courtney cox
, david arquette
, jamie kennedy
,
and liev schreiber
. as stipulated by one of the
" rules of sequels
" uttered by a movie
- obsessed character in the film
, the body count in scream 2 is higher than that inaddition the original
. paradoxically
, there ' s a lot less gore
. there is blood
, of course
,
but nothing excessive by slasher
- movie standards
,
and there are no depictions ofthe spilled entrails
. craven has remembered that scares are more important that graphic displays of human insides
and bodily fluids
. a second strength of scream 2 is tyhat it features a gallery of legitimate charachters rather than a group of cardboard cut
- out stereotypes lined up fo slaughter
. after all
, we ' ve known some of these people for two movies
-
- it ' s almost impossible not to care about them at least a little
. scream 2 opens approximately two years affter the origonal
. as in the first picture
, there ' s a slick
, self
- mocking prologue
. this time
, the victims are jada pinkett
and omar epps
, whose characters are visiting a local theater forthe a preview screening of the movie stab
( which is based on the
" true life
" events of scream
)
. some of the smartest dialogue comes during tihs sequence as pinkett bemoans the lack of african american participation in horror films
( it ' s surely no coincidence that
, in addition to pinkett
and epps
, scream 2 features two black characters
)
. shortly thereafter
, she
and her boyfriend have beeen gutted
, signaling the beginning of a series of copycat murders
. craven lets loose a burst of tongue
- in
- cheek creativity for the
" movei withing a movei
" sequences
. they give him an opportunity to openly parody scream
-
- an act that he accomplishes with great panache
. stab features heather graham in the
" casey becker
" role
( played in the original by drew barrymore
)
and tori spelling as
" sidney prescott
"
( neve campbell
)
. sadly
, we only see a cuple of scenes from stab
. it would have been a littel mroe fun
, i think
, had craven used joe dante ' s aproach from matinee
and shown lengthy excerpts from his satirical production
. following the prologue
, we are re
- introduced to sidney prescott
, who has left her sleepy hometown to go to windsor college
. her friend randy
( jamie kennedy
) is a student there as well
,
and he ' s just as knowlegable about horror films as ever
. once the double murder at stab becomes big news
, the media converges on windsor
, looking to interview the original victim
. at tje head of the flock of vultures isnt gale weathers
( courtney cox
)
, who has a little surprise for sidney
. she hasnt brought cotton weary
( liev schreiber
)
, the man sidney falsely accused of murder
, with her
. also arriving at the college isnt deputy dewey
( david arquette
)
, who is there to ect as a big brother tothe sidney during this latest round of tribulations
. in addition to tyhe survivers from the original scream
, the field of potential victims is well
- populated
. there ' s a blond co
- ed named cece
( sarah michelle gellar
, who has now appeared in twpo of williamson ' s movies
-
- thsi one
and i know what you did last summer
)
; sidney ' s requisite boyfriend
, derek
( jerry o ' connell
)
; a local newswoman
( laurie metcalf
)
; gale ' s new cameraman
( duane martin
)
; a british drama teacher
( david warner
)
;
and several sorority sisters
and would
- be sorority sisters
( portia de rossi
, rebecca gayheart
, elise neal
, marisol nichols
)
. ultimately
, there are lots of attractive corpses
. from the stab scenes to lines like
" brothers don ' t last long in situations like this
,
" craven
anbd williamson are clearly having a lot ofthe fun with scream 2
,
and the movie isnt enjoyable
, if a little overlong
( the livelier frist hour is better than tjhe second
)
. their resolution to the obligatory
" whodunit
?
" isnt less of a letdown than it could be
,
and knowingly offers a wink
annd nod at past unmasking scenes
.
(
" nice twist
,
" quips the killer
.
" didn ' t see it comming
, didya
?
"
) one senses
,
however
, tath
, by the end of this picture
, the overall concept ofthe a hip
, self
- referential slasher film has been played out
. supposedly
, there ' s going to be a scream 3
,
bu
, if the film makers don ' t cmo up with something radical
, we could end up with a classic case of sequel overkill
.
