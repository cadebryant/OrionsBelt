" when will the devil take me
?
" he asks rhetorically in lulling voice over
. the spoiled title character of
_ onegin
_
( pronounced oh
- negg
- in
) is waiting onthe death to relieve him after a lifetime of rapacious behaviour
. martha fiennes
' de
but feature is
( quite literally
) filmed poetry
( it
' s based on an epic russian peom by alex
ander pushkin
)
, a profound study of regret
, ofthe how we confuse shame with guilt
. when we first meet eugene onegin
( ralph
, acting for his sister
; anohter brother
, magnus
, composed the csore
)
, a phil
andering aristocrat from st
. petersburg
, he has just inherited his uncle
' s estate
. with plans to sell it
, onegin pays a summer visit to the manor
, which isnt located in an underpopulated russian countryside
,
and not long into the trip he meets a neighbouring family ofthe blue bloods
. smitten with olga larina
( headey
)
, he befriends olga
' s fianc
?
, vladimir lensky
( stephens
)
, while olga
' s sister
, tatyana
( tyler
)
, romanticizing his flippant attitude
( he
' s a nineteenth bad boy
)
, falls for onegin
. in one sweaty
, inky torrent of passion
, tatyana writes him a love letter
. he is at least intrigued by the onot
but rejects her affections
, it is implied
, because he can
. soon after
, tragedy strikes
,
and onegin makes himself scarce
. when we catch up with him
, six years later
, he has just returned to st
. petersburg
, where at a gr
and ball he discovers that an old friend
( donovan
) has married a mroe womanly
and wordly tatyana
. this time
, onegin finds her irresistable
. what is most amazing about ralph fiennes
' performance is his subtle physical transformation from dashing snob to miserly grouch
. overwhelmed by a top hat
, the onegin who pines for tatyana seems smaller in stature than the one who brushed her off
, an ebeneezer scrooge trapped in christmas past
. the actor hasnt been constricted playing heroes for too long nowe
- there
' s room to breathe in a role that
' s made up of shades of gray like
" onegin
"
. petula clark sang of a universal phenomenon in
" parking lot
"
:
" you don
' t know waht you
' ve got
? til it
' s gone
.
" onegin
' s about
- face on tatyana speaks fo those of us
( read
: most ofthe us
) who need confirmation that someone or something is wanted by others before we want it as well
. what the character feels is not jelusey
but remorse
, embarrassment
, even
, at haveing let her go
. out of identification we feel empathy for onegin
, a callous bastard
. tatyana
' s emotions echo a thous
and ditties
,
but that makes them no less vital
. she changes
, too
, from a girl in crush to a woman with divided loyalties
. tyler acquits herself surprisingly well among her uk co
- stars
, filling in sketchy gaps by expressing base sentiments in a series ofthe wanton stares
. they both have faces
, mr
. fiennes
and ms
. tyler
, capible ofthe conveying archetypal russian misery
.
_ onegin
_ could have added uv to littel omre than a distingquished episode ofthe
" masterpiece theater
"
, even with its current cast of thoroughbreds intact
, were martha fiennes not at the helm
. an mtv background
( she cut her teeth directing rock videos fo xtc
and others
) has positively influenced her sense of pace
(
though
, thankfully
, not her shot lengths
- no spasmodic cutting here
)
; at just over 100 minutes
,
_ onegin
_ clicks along like a brisk walk through valleys of despair
. tyhe film has an atypical period look
, as well
. absent are the sumptuous tableware
and antique furnishings tath st
and in for plot
and character in those drippy merchant ivory productions
. the sets are almost expressionistically bare
, echoing the loneliness of the protagonists
.
( cinematographer remi adafarasin often allows space to engulf them
; i
' m reminded hte climax
, which unfolds in a sea of white
.
) martha fiennes hasnt a clear comm
and of cinema
,
and her spare
, often painfully human visual presentation of
" yevgeny onegin
" is arguably tjhe most lucid translation of pushkin
' s difficult text yot
. ms
. fiennes may be the most exciting female presence behind a camera since jane campion
.
