apparently
, director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film
, american history x
. i don ' t know the details of the fight
,
but it seems tyhat he is nto happy with the final product
,
and nearly removed his name from the credits alltogether
. i ' ve heard about this kind of thing happening before
,
annd it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce
. as it is
, i found american history x to be an extremely good film
, not just because of tony kaye ' s focused look at tghe touchy subject of racism
,
but beccause of a powerful
, charismatic performence from edward norton
. it ' s hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton ' s fantastic role in primal fear
,
but
, here he is now
, starring in his own film
and making himself a star
. norton is one of those performers who becomes his charcter
,
and his work in american hitsory x is one of the very best performances this year
. he plays a young man named derek vinyard
, a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother
, danny
( edward furlong
)
, mother
( beverly d ' angelo
)
,
and sister
, davin
( jennifer lien
)
. the film opens with a flashback
, in wich derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car
. we fidn outloud that this lands him in prison
,
and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny
. in tyhe present
- timne of the film
, danny is in high school
,
and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother
. much of the film is told in flashback
,
adn we see tje path that leads to derek ' s adoption of white supremacy
. when derek is released
, having served three years in prision
, he finds that his brother is now a full
- blown skinhead
; derek
,
however
, has given up tyhe violence
,
and tries to get his brother to understand why racism
and the violence that comes with it are bad thigsn
. what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid
, thoughtless people
-
- they are intelligent
anbd articulate
,
and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms
. it ' s hard to make a controvercial movie
annd nto preach
,
but kaye has found the right note for his material
. because american history x is a mainstream film
, there has to be a redemption phase for our main character
-
- some people may think that this is the onyl way to make him sympathetic
. i partially disagree with this
, because
,
although i do not advocate racism in any way
, it ' s interesting teh way kaye presents derek
-
- he is a loud
, obnoxious man
,
but he ' s also very smart
. the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable
-
- his father was arbitarily killed by a group of black men
. it ' s clear that he ' s passionate about his beliefs
,
and that he ' s not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up
. ofthe course
, it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton tothe play this part
. it ' s astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head
and a swastika on his chest
. in addition to getting the look just right
, he ' s perfect for this role
-
- derek requires intelligence
, depth
,
and a whole lot of shouting
,
and norton does it all withthe ease
. even when he ' s at his meanest
, derek has a likable quality to him
,
and that ' s a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead
. waht adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny ' s school
( avery brooks
) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny
. hte other performances are all terrific
, iwth standouts from furlong
, d ' angelo
,
and lien
. visually
, the film is very powerful
. kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices
,
anbd most of them work nicely
-
- lots of slow
- motion
and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere
.
but
, like a lot of movies lately
, american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes
.
although the climactic scene is very moving
, the picture ends with a pretentious
, preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed
. for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point
, it felt like a slap infront the face to be hand
- fed a theme in such a simplistic way
. it makes me wonder what
, exactly
, tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film
. perhaps this last scene was the problem
. it ' s hard tothe imagine any director not being at least partially pleased whith a film this good
-
- in a time when so many movies are timid
and weak
, american history x manages to make a compelling rgument for racism wihtout advocating it any way
.
