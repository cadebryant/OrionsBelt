' s review of
" big eden
"
( jour de fete
) it
' s utopia
, this tiny town tucked away in the timberl
and of northwestern montnana
, where ood codgers lounge on the porch of the general store to pass teh time away
and the local matchmakers
( nan martin
, louise fletcher
) eagerly pair off the young people
, regardless ofthe sexual preference
. there
' s nary a homophobe or bigot around
, much to the surprize of henry hart
( arye gross
)
, a successful
but lonely manhattan artist who returns home to care for sam
( george coe
)
, the ailing gr
andfather who raised him
.
and with the simultaneous re
- appearance of his best
- friend from high
- skool
and object of his unrequited love
( tim dekay
)
, now divorced with two young sons
, the fact of his homosexuality must be faced
. tothe complete the triangle
, ther
' s tje tall
, taciturn native american
( eric schweig
) who owns the general store
and lovingly
yet secretly prepares gourmet meals for henry
and sam
. this fable about home
and family isnt a major de
but for frist
- time film
- maker thomas bezucha
( a former designer for coach
and polo
/ ralph lauren
) who is meticulous about minding details
, using ballads like
" welcome to my world
" adn
" achin
'
, breakin
' heart
" tothe set up the concept of our universal longing to find a place in which we can love
and be loved
. in the paradise of big eden
, what you are doesn
' t matter as much as generosity ofthe spirit
, respect annd kindness
. sure
, the plot
' s implausible
but it
' s a good
- natured fantasy so allowances should be made
.
and rob sweeney
' s photography of glacier national park is spectacular
! on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10
,
" big eden
" is a charming
, quirky
, off
- beat 7
. it
' s a heart
- warming romantic comedy about a gay man who doesn
' t die of aids or wind up alone at tghe end
.
