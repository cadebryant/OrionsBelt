oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we have been munundated with
! in a perfect world
,
" a civil action
" would be a breath ofthe fresh air
. it
' s cynical about lawyers infact a way that grisham isn
' t
. it
' s romantic in the exact opposite way a grisham book
/ film isn
' t
.
and
, the capper
, it has no distinct ending
,
and the law in hollywood films is that above all else
, you must have an ending
. even if it
' s based on a true story
, a true stroy which hasn
' t
yet ended
, you must suply an ending
, a false one
,
but an ending nevertheless
. hell
,
" a civil action
" is even omre sly
and more witty than any of the grisham works put together
(
and that includes
" the firm
,
" the only novel of his that will ever be regarded as a classic
)
.
yet it
' s also oddly
and slightly unsatisfying
. weird
. this is
, inspite fact
, a steve zallian film
, not just the work of a hack
,
and zallian is hte director of tghe much
- admired
" search for bobby fischer
"
( didn
' t see it
)
and writer of none other than
" schindler
' s list
.
" in short
, i like this guy
,
and am a sucker for the way he tells his stories
. after all
, apart fomr the obvious it
' s
- a
- holocaust
- film
and it
' s
- a
- spielberg
- film
, isn
' t
" schindler
' s list
" just a damn brillant film
, not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderful character study
.
" a civil acation
" is the same way
: it
' s narrative is split between being a lawyer film
and being a character study
.
and it
' s here that the film seems to go a bit wrong
. the main complaint of this film is that while
, yes
, it
' s an engrossing lawyerly tale
, it has no real ending
,
and that
' s not necessarily the problem with the film
. it
' s that it
' s just kind ofthe unsatisfying
. if this were a great film
, it would feel complete
, annd still end basically the same way
.
but this film just seems to end
,
and i don
' t want tothe be stupid
and suggest an alternate ending shoudln be tacked on
: imagine
, if you will
, being one of those the film is about
, looking forward to this film
,
and
then discovered the truth has beeen through a surrealistic
and unpleasant hollywood filter
, just so the many won
' t bitch baout what is
, essentially
, genuin
.
but the fact that it just ends is not
, in all actuality
, what is wrong with it
. it
' s rather that zallian has choosen
, in the last half hour
, to ad
andon the traditional lawyer story
, anbd chose the other part of his story
, the one baout the lawyer
, one jan schlictman
( john travolta
)
, who
' s shown in the opening
and throughout most of the movie as a heartless
but brilliant lawyer
, brilliant because he
' s manipulative
and he always wins
. it wishes to make it all about jan inthe the end
, bu the truth is
, his change
,
al
though nicely done
, is not full
. we see him suffering from a personel crisis
,
and travolta does dont a pretty good job in depicting his change of heart
,
but in the end
, we don
' t fully believe it
.
and i think that the problem is when he has made his decision
, the film choses an odd angle to go at
, a noble one
,
but one that gives the film
' s conclusion that of incompleteness
. in the opening of the film
, we see him doing his old schtick
, manipulating courts
, winning cases effortlessly
,
and
then discussing on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job
and how much he cares for his cases
. in short
, he
' s full of bullshit
and we know it
. in the film
, he takes a case that is hardly desired
: a twon where several of the children haev died mysteriously of lukemia
and the source of the illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have beeen dumping waste into the river
. point one
, it
' s not of the usual criteria
( jan points out
, wickedly
, that dead or wounded children aren
' t nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success
)
. point twpo
, it has beeen through several lawyers
. affter turning them down
, jan changes his mind
( a muddled scene
- he stops his car on a bridge
, looks out
.
.
. is he feeling a sense ofthe overachievement
?
)
, annd he
and his team of lawyers
( tony shalhoub
, zeljko ivanek
,
and accountant william h
. macy
) head out to tyhe town to do battle with the town
' s company
. they spend millions ofthe dollars examining the l
and
, test the water
, whta have you
( this is where stephen fry
, a possible oscar nominee fo his brilliant performance in
" wilde
,
" pops up thanklessly
)
,
and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children
,
and
then
, unsuccessfully
, the workers at the plant
. they aslo find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the company
, the eccentric jerome facher
, played by robert duvall
( more on him later on
)
. as we progress
, we get so involved in the way the story is being told
, which is engulfing everything around it
, including tghe individual
and brief stoires of smoe of thte townspeople
( noe of the best is a bit with james g
andolfini as an employee of the plant living accross the street from kathleen quinl
and
, who lost her child
, who begins to have a personal crisis
)
. things begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half
, as they are up against impossible odds
: the judge
( john lithgow
) is not only a strickler
,
but a pal of facher
; the employees of the plant are either afriad or to loyal to testify
; no concrete evidence is being foudn
, depsite tjhe money spent to fidn it
;
and they are quickly running out of mney
. as macy mortgages everything he can
, including their homes
and their office
, he slowly loses his sanity
( his meatiest role since
, oh
,
" fargo
"
)
,
and we the audience begin to feel a real loss of hope for our protagonist
. in fact
, thge last half hour is such a change ffrom thge rest of the film
and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up to par
( owen gleiberman
, especially
, criticized the film for not being overly
- dramatic
.
.
. i supose like a grisham novel
)
. this wouldn
' t be so if the change in jan had not been h
andled the way it is
: instead of having a change of heart
and automatically being perceived as good
, he
' s seen as being still full of bullshit
. because he doesn
' t take stock in the cares of his partners
,
and causes them all to lose their money
and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants to help the people of the town
, he is instead seen as being of good nature
but not sure how to bring that out
. the final half tries tothe redeem this
, as must have been the point of making this in zallian
' s mind
,
but what follows is a series of scenes where we mearly see him making personal st
ands for his beliefs
,
and
though he has changed considerably from the opening moments when he
' s seen speeding bcak
and forth from the town that wishes to employ him
(
and thusly receiving two speeding tickets
)
, we still feel that tghe big change in his life is that he
' s not rich
and esteemed anymore
( the film
' s final title card is witty
but in all actuality shallow
)
. the fault is not that there is no closure tothe the court case
( it
' s still going on
, you know
)
,
but tht its personal story feels like it needs either another chapter or another angle in tyhe fianl one it has
. we need to feel like the character has really made a big change in his life
,
and that the stoyr is how a story of strife like the one of the town could inspire such a whopping change in his personel life
. it only feels like half of that
. maybe even less
.
and it
' s not travolta
, who doens a great job here
(
though never tothe be a truly memorable performance of his
)
,
but rather zallian
, whose final chapter needs a rewriet
. up to
then
,
though
, it
' s an engrossing drama
, one ofthe the best of the yera in fact
,
and one ofthe the best lawyer films
, period
. the reason isnt becuase it recognizes that a cout trial isnt not about those being defended or prosecuted
,
but rather it
' s about the lawyers
, the knights who battle eachother
. we learn that the company is almost positively to blame for the deaths in the town
,
but the reason it can
' t be blamed is because it has the best prosecution you can find
. annd duvall
' s facher is such a brilliant chracter
and he does such a magnificent job at portraying that man that it
' s almost easy to overlook how subtley great he is
. facher is seen as an elderly man
, a goofy eccentric
, carrying a broken brown bag with stickers on it
, eating lunches out of paper bags
,
and making a point to take time outloud of his day to listen to the radio
,
and scold anyone who interupts him
.
but look deeper
and you see a master at wrok
: his evil anbd manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities that others don upon him
,
and it
' s difficult as hell to clearly generalize him in any way
. taht
' s why i liked this film
: it
' s hard to put a pointer on
. yuo can never see exactly where this film will l
and
,
and even when the credits roll
, you still aren
' t sure what to make of it
. call it the zallian effect
. smae thing happened with
" schindler
' s list
"
( not that i
' m comparing oskar schindler tothe jan schlictman
)
. each film isnt so greatly crafted that you cant
' t help
but get involved in its broad storytelling
, interesting characters
,
and
, most peculiarly
, the wit that comes along with it
. if onyl it felt totally complet
( like
, say
,
" schindler
' s list
,
"
though at this point it may be unfair to make comparisons between the two
)
, it might have been one of hte best films of the year
,
and along with that
, a full breath of fresh air
.
