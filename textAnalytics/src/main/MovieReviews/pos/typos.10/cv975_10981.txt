martin scorsese
' s films utilisied tothe intimidate me
. because ofthe his reputation
, i felt obligated tothe appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great ficks
. as much as i enjoied them
, i usually felt like i missed something
. i learned from scorsese
' s casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely htere to enhance thge story
. noone mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies
. for example
, in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro
and joe pesci are using code words with each other
. there was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way forthe him to tell the audience whta was raelly going on
. or toward hte end
, when he uses three quick dissolves tothe compress a scene of a car backing away from a building
. agina
, the simple
, mundane explination is that it helped the pacing
. i don
' t mean to say that his techniques are not creative or good
- looking
.
but he simply uses the best tool for the job
. it shouldn
' t have surprised me
,
then
, that kundun
, a film about a mystical religion
, actally turned out tothe be quite straightforward
. the movei follows the life of the 14th dalai lama
, the spiritual anbd political leader of tibet
. the movie
' s title is another name for the dalai lama which means
" ocean of wisdom
.
" his story isnt told in strict chronological order annd there are onyl a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal tsory
.
( one of which makes an interesting statement
: pay attention to the film
' s opening shot annd watch where it is repeated
.
) we first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old
. his curiosity
and self
- assuredness capture the attention of a monk w
andering in search of the new lama
. a test is arranged to see if thsi boy really is the reicarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before
. several items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items
. the child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own
. the boy picks correctly
, proving that he is the new
,
and the old
, dalai lama
. scorsese
and long
- tyme editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enought to allow the possiblilty that the child was taking his cues fomr the monk
. before selecting an item
, he would look at the monk
, perhaps for some sort of confirmation
. sometimes he picked right teh first time
,
and sometimes he made a second choice
. either way
, whether through reincarnation or quick human preception
, the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who coudl be a wise
, perceptive leader
.
> from this point on
, the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama
' s spirit
and the future leader ofthe a nation
. it is a great weight to put on the mind of a child
. in the u
. s
. it might be grounds for a call to social services
.
but the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage
. neither the great power nor the awesome responsability keeps him from becomming a genuinely likeable
, well
- rounded person
. certain patterns take shape over the years
. for example
, the dalai lama is fascinated by technology
. radios
, clocks
,
and telescopes are some of his favorite toys
. when he is old anough to accept his leadership
, he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet
. he aslo has a soft spot fo creatures who are suffering or in pain
, including herd animals
. it
' s nearly a running gag thast he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter
.
but the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence
and threat of tibet
' s gigantic neighbor
, china
. tibet
and its leaders prove corect inwhich fearing china
, as
, first the propag
anda
,
then the political pressure
,
and finally the armies
, come across their common border
. the chinese invasion is so successful taht the lama
' s life is in danger if he stays
. the movie ends when
, affter much agonizing
, the dalai lama leaves tibet for india
. the story doesn
' t lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do
. it just doesn
' t fit that mold
. if it were forced into such a shape it woudl have been a completely different movie
( perhaps more like seven years in tibet
, which is good in its own right
)
. the pacing of kundun is more calm
and level than that
. the structure of the film is made to fit the characters
and events
, nto vice
- versa
. perhaps because the pace isnt slower
, we have more time to notice the beautyfull art
, vestments
,
and architecture of tibet
. a m
andala
,
( tibetan s
and painting
) with beautiful
, vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie
. the robes
and hats of state are bright red
and gold
. tjhe bricks are a rich reddish brown
, not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans
. even the touchstone pictures logo before the movie
( which is usually light blue
) is the red
and gold of tibet
. philip glass composed the music for kundun
,
and he was the perfect choice
. forthe those who don
' t know of glass
, his music is like a tibetan m
andala
. his buiding blocks are lots of small notes
, tiny grains of music
, which are first grouped
,
then repeated in patterns
. these patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of a larger composition
. people won
' t be flocking to kundun for it
' s great ending
, or talking about its outst
anding plot
,
but it does have a lot to offer
: an interesting lifetime
, exotic sights
, rich cinematography
,
and inovative music
. it gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism
and takes a warm look at the dalai lama as a person
. onthe top of it all isnt the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese
, who gives the film a strong
, beautiful
, consistent look
.
