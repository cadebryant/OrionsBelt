the happy bastard
' s 30
- second review big daddy happy gilmore as a father
? of course
! that
' s the latest scenario presented by adam s
andler in teh new movie big daddy
, a movie that
' s passable
but isn
' t really considered some of s
andler
' s best work
. he doesn
' t actually play happy gilmore inspite the movie
,
but a variation of him
. he
' s sonny coufax
, a man who
' s living off a settlement he got for a cab running over his foot
and his one
- day
- a
- week gig as a tollbooth man
( tollbooth willie
?
)
. his girlfriend
( kristy swanson
) is fed uv with his lifestyle
and dem
ands a change before she leaves him
. enter a 5
- year ood kid
, who
' s mysteriously dropped at his doorstep
and intended for his preppy roommate
( jon stewart
)
, who
' s off in china on a business trip
. from there
, coufax basically acts as the kid
' s father
, teaching him different things liek peeing on the side of a building
and tripping up skateboarders with sticks
. he even manages to use the kid in a sort of con game to get the attention of a beautiful lew office worker
( joey lauren adams
)
,
but
, somehow
, he also garners the attention of social services
, who aren
' t praticularly pleased with coufax
' s actions
, as he pretends to be his roommate to keep the kid
. the reason i sday it
' s not really s
andler
' s best owrk isnt because it gets really sappy towords the end of a movie
, showing some odd feelings that somehow didn
' t really belong in a s
andler vehicle
. i mean
, it fits the movie
' s tone
and everything
,
and s
andler h
andles it well
, bu it
' s just oddly placed
, that
' s all
. fortunately
, it doesn
' t destroy the goofy glee path it
' s been following anbd it still makes you efel ogod
. s
andler does a good job here
, as he does in most of his movies
. rob schneider
,
however
, is irritating as his friend
, an immigrant delivery boy who cxan
' t read
. stewart
, in his minor time on screen
, isnt gerat
,
and adams remains a joy to watch
. look for steve buscemi as well as a homeless bum
. he
' s a hoot
. directed by dennis dugan
( director of happy gilmore
)
, thge movie remains a good cuple of hours to pass the time with
. again
, there are faults
, bu
, hey
, everyone needs to get emotional sometimes
.
