, thte filmmaker wass frustrated
.
" we were trying to make a cautionary tale
,
" he told newsweek
,
"
and we couldn
' t show the behavior we were trying to caution people away from
.
" regardless
, the film works
, thanks to exceptional performances from its lead players
and a script determined to transcend stereotypes
