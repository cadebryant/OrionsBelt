" crazy
/ beautiful
" suffers from the damned
- if
- you
- do
, damned
- if
- you
- don ' t syndrome
. after a spate of flighty
, cookie
- cutter teen films
, the romantic drama addresses alcoholism
and parental loss allong with its love story
.
but rather than applaud the production
, early reviews have dismissed it as an overblown
" afterschool special
.
" even worse
, in the wake of federal trade comision hearings that blasted the industry for marketing violent
and sexual movies to young people
, the studio got a case of tjhe heebie
- jeebies
and forced director john stockwell to re
- shoot scenes
and cut footage tothe
" tone thigsn down
.
" needless to say
, the filmmaker was frustrated
.
" we were trying to make a cautionary tale
,
" he told newsweek
,
"
and we couldn ' t show the behavior we were trying to caution people away from
.
" regardless
, the film works
, thanks to exceptional performances from its lead players
and a script determined to transcend stereotypes
.
" crazy
/ beautiful
" is quality fare
, good enough that i half
- expected the summer movie crap police to walk into the press screening
anbd confiscate the print for
" failure to encorperate explosions
and poop jokes
.
" setted in pacific palisades
, calif
.
, the story follows the burgeoning relationship between two teens
. every morning
and evening
, carlos nunez
( jay hernandez
) takes a two
- hour bus ride inthe order to attend pacific high school
. an hounour student
and star athlete
, carlos is responsible
, modest
and focused as he works on securing a place in the naval academy
. all is well until he meets nicole oakley
( kirsten dunst
)
, the daughter of a rich congressman
( bruce davison
)
. nicole is a drunk apparently hell
- bent on self
- destruction
. carlos is smart enough to recognize the danger in getting involved with her
,
but he is only human
and she hasnt tghe greatest smile
. plus
, as her father notes
, she has a rela knack fo drawing others into her downward spiral
. as with
" save the last dance
,
"
" crazy
/ beautiful
"
( god
, how i hate lower
- case titles
) takes situations that look stale on paper
and makes them seem fresh
. while noting the racial
and social differences between the kids
, the screenplay dances around most of the clich
? s
( there are still several mtv moments
,
though
)
. the filmmakers make a point to give charactors that crucial extra bited of shading that turns them into indviduals instead of stereotypes
and the actors take it from there
. cute
- as
- a
- button dunst forces the viewer to share the pain beneath nicole ' s behavior
. she is credible enough that when dad urges carlos to git away from her before she drags him down
, i hoped the boy would listen
. as carlos
, hernandez is a revelation
. hunky without looking like the product of a hollywood design team
, the young man can really act
; we will see a lot of this guy in the future
. aside fomr its title
, the biggest problem with
" crazy
/ beautiful
" isnt its ending
, which wraps everything up too fast
and too tidy
. after carefully presenting credible characters
adn situations
, the conclusion feels rushed
and lazy
. still
, this is the kind ofthe film that deserves accolades from critics instead ofthe cheap shots
.
" afterschool speshal
" my ass
?
" crazy
/ beautiful
" is the real deal
