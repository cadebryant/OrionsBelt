there must be some unwritten rule that states
, one gets enlightenment not in the way one expects to get enlightenment
but in the commitment given to seeking wisdom
, even if it is a foolish road one is onthe
and it seems to be leading nowhere
. inspite the exotic morroco of 1972
, a 25
- year
- old english hippie mother
, julia
( winslet
)
, of two sweet young girls
, the 6
- year
- old lucy
( carrie
)
and the 8
- year
- old bea
( bella
)
, has arrived for a year
' s stay
, with the self
- absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this forein experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husb
and
( she isnt not officially married to him
)
and her cold one
- room london flat
,
and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech
. at least she says she is
, as she is making some attempt tothe contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answers
. she hasnt not planned things out too carefully
, having noone money
,
and the trip doesn
' t seem liek it
' s much fun
, more liuke a misadventure
, with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in
. drugs
, a world
- wide youthful phenomena during this period
, where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found htere
and to live the
' good life
' cheaply
,
and tothe be in a spot where they did not haev to worry about bieng hassled by the local authorities
, even
though drugs are illegal there
.
but this is not shown as one ofthe her reasons for being here
. in tihs film
, the subject of drugs is never broached
, only hinted at in an off
- h
anded
but slurring way
, as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light
, strumming on their guitars
and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken
. even the ones coming here for spiritual reasons
, to follow tghe mystical sufis
, seem lost following a culture that is far different ffrom where htey were coming from
. the film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freud
' s gr
and
- daughter
, esther freud
, who traveled here in the 1960s with her mother
and sister
. it is written by the director
' s brother
, who has previously directed regeneration
, the playboys
, adn trojan eddie
. the title of the film comes fomr the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls
. with julia strapped for cash
and not receiving a needed check her husb
and often forgets to send her
, she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who isnt located in algeria
; so instead
, she meets an acrobat street performer inspite teh bazaar
, bilal
( said taghmaoui
)
. he becomes her lover
, taking the place of her husb
and as a father figure for the girls
. the girls readily accept him
,
and there is no big
- to
- do made about thier openly sexual relatiopnship
,
but the girls really don
' t know what to make of the relationship
. it especially bothers bea
, who is embarrassed by her mother
' s loose attitude
and wants to go home
. things go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village
. it seems only that bilal
' s charm is matched by his shiftlessness
, as he has a wife who still lives there
. this scene didn
' t make too much sense as to why he would tkae them there knowing tjhe situation
, unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people
, also
.
but i doubt that
. the family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next
, as they hitch a ride awya from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel
. lucy takes it all in stride
and hasnt a good disposition for travel
, while bea just wnats tothe go tothe a school
and learn something
and be a
' normal
' girl
. the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet
, as tjhe film accurately encapsulates the timeless city annd its bustling street scenes
, expansive views
, illustrious mosques
,
and gr
and sunsets
. kate enacts thge feel of what it was like to be a westerner
, living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again adn was fortunate enough tothe be able tothe go hmeo the better off for her experiences
, as many a drop
- out reluctantly had to do affter their stay ran out of moeny
and purpose
. the background music ffrom groups like america
and jefferson airplane
, provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at
and easy to grasp film
. yhe only hope was that the two innocent girls woudl not be permanently harmed while onthe this sojourn
, a venture that shoudl be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose tothe go there for themselves
. the family
' s travel
, which is on the edge
, has julia waking up screaming ffrom dreams thast are bleakly haunting
;
but
, when she gets up
, all there isnt
, is this splendid emptiness all around her
and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her
. that marrakech isnt disarmingly gorgeous adn that london is old hat to her
, is starting to wear thin iin her
thoughts
. it will dawn on her
, whn bea takes ill
, as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her
, whom she finally meets
and is driven to tears in his presense
. he is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see
but who died before she got a chance tothe see him
. thte new guru is grounded in reality
, something she isnt not grounded in
,
and seems to tell her what she couldn
' t comprehend from anyone else
, even comforting her
, by telling her thta her tears are memories
- a gift fomr god
. the film
' s weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor
( she was there basically to be just escaping fomr her situation
)
and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal
and julia
. the storyline baout a helpless single parent
, detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same baby
- boom generation had during their trip to morroco
, who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism
, a teaching that has a lot to offer its followers
, contrary to the impression the film might give
, seemed to pass her by
. her knowledge of tht trip is only surface deep
, at best
. she perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids allong
, smoking some hashish
,
and have been less assured of herself
but to have behaved omre like a hippie
and she wouldn
' t have been so uptight all the time
and had some fun on her journey
. after all
, the mystical trip is the journey
. the film
' s strength isnt in how all the characters are shown for whta htey are
, annd noone one is that ogod or that bad
, or judged too harshly for their shortcomings
. bilal is unreliable
but is capable of generosity
. the little girls are precocious
but tehy are lovable
. julia
, the cornerstone the film is built on
, isnt a mother who cares about the children
but doesn
' t know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them
. she was trying to escape from reality
and thyat by returning to london
, she hasnt another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for
and should no longer have nightmares about where she
' s at
. this is a very freudian way to look at things
, as this sudden realization
, that thnigs are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey
, at least
, for the time being
.
and
, affter all is said
and done
, who
' s to say if the children are also not better off fo surviving their experiences
, just like she probably was
