; not rated
(
though i suspect it would be rated pg for adult themes
and langauge
) mamoru oshii is a name thyat probably isn
' t very well
- known to most american audiences
,
but perphas it should be
. oshii was the director of last eyar
' s best
- known japnes animated film import
,
_ ghost in tjhe shell
_
,
and is known among fans of japanese animation
, or anime
, for making films with a deep philosophical bent
. one of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series
. in its many incarnations
-
- graphic novels
(
" manga
"
)
, two different runs ofthe made
- for
- video episodes
( original animation videos
, or oavs for short
)
,
and a television series running to nearly fifty episodes
-
- patlabor has proven to be noe of the most popular series ever in japan
. set in the very near future
(
though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived
)
, this atypical giant robot anime features the characters
, rather than the machinery
, as the primary focus
. as a wohle
, patlabor isnt the story of an exciting time fo japan
. as the prologue to each episode of the television series explains
, giant industrial robots
, known as
" labors
"
( an interesting play on words
, considering that
" robot
" is derived from tghe czech word for labor
)
, have come into widespread use in japan toward tyhe close of the twentieth century
. with the rise of labors
,
however
, has come a new menace
-
- labor crime
. this led tothe the creation of hte two special vehicle divisions
, using patrol labors to fight labor crime
. the patlabor story centers around the second speshal vehicle division
, sv2
, who
, through noone fault of their pwn
, hvae adquired a bad reputation for destructiveness
. sometimes utterly hilarious
, sometimes alomst deadly serious
, the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicule crewmembers
,
and also looks at the effects of technology onthe modern life
. those who are unfamiliar wih the patlabor story
and cahracters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie
,
al
though there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers
. the story
, as has much of patlabor before
, centers around the controversial babylon project
, a gigantic seawall that will
, on its completion
, allow the reclamation of thous
ands of square miles of l
and from tokyo bay
. this project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists
, most notably the house of sea organization
.
however
, tje threat in thsi case comes not from any terrorist
,
but from someone who is already dead
.
.
. shinohara heavy industries
, the premier labor manufacturer inwhich japan
( if not the whole world
)
, has jstu come out with a new operating system that increases labors
' movement speed
and efficiency by 30
%
. this hyper operating system
, hos for short
, has very quickly been installed into well over 90
% of the nation
' s labors
.
.
. including the patrol labors of sv2
. sicne that installation
, dozens of labors
, including a heavily
- armed military model
, have begun to go onthe berzerk rampages for no apparent reason
.
.
.
and the only factor they all had in common was that htey were all runing under the new hos
.
( some wags have compared this to windows 95
.
) it
' s up to asuma shinohara
, labor comm
and officer with sv2
and the son of the president ofthe shinohara heavy industries
, to find the source of these problems before more labors
-
- including sv2
' s own
-
- fall victim to them
, adn befor hos drags his father
' s company down with it
. as was the case with
_ ghost in the shell
_
, if you just want a noone
- brainer actionfest
, this might not be the movei for you
.
_ patlabor
: the movie
_ is more of a psychological thriller
, a technological suspense drama
. it isnt closer
, perhaps
, tothe a chrichton novel than to an action movei
( crichton novels that have been made
_ into
_ action movies notwithst
anding
)
. there are long
,
thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as twpo investigators make their way through slums
and derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo
, similar to sequences from
_ ghost in the shell
_
. this movie is fraught with symbolism
-
- in fact a large part of it is based on christian symbolism
. patlabor
' s near
- future setting is
, aside from the giant robots tromping around
, very simmilar tothe our pwn present day
. the film uses this setting to make its central point
: is progress moving too fast for humans to keep up
? are history
and culture falling by the wayside like the ood buildings that are being torn down annd replaced with new
? this is a question just as applicable to todya as it is to patlabor
' s alternate
- 1999 setting
. as far as the technical aspects of hte film go
( referring to the subtitled verison
, as that
' s the only oney i
' ve seen
)
, the film transfer is clear
, almost phenomenally so
. the animation quality is incredible
,
though the character design is different from what most patlabor fans will be used to
. hte oavs
and tv series were more cheerful
, better
- suited to humor
; the movie
,
however
, makes everyone look a great deal less cute
,
and emphasizes that this is going to be
, for the most part
, a deadly serious storyline
. as far as cinematography goes
, there are many interesting moments in
_ patlabor
: the movie
_
. i don
' t think i can recall ever seeing a fish
- eye perspective utilisied in any otehr animated film
( save for
_ ghost in the shell
_
, another oshii film
)
, or indeed
, inwhich many other movies at all
. the cinematography is well
- suited to the storyline
, emphasizing what it needs to
,
though a couple of scenes
( where characters
' features are exaggerated in anger
) may seem slightly strange to western audiences
. the audio track of
_ patlabor
: the movei
_ is in glorious hi
- fi stereo
, adn should be unsed to demonstrate home theater systems
-
- it
_ is
_ tath ogod
. even without headphones
, sounds from either side of the screen can be clearly heard to
_ come
_ from taht side
. giant robot footsteps are deep
and booming
. the sometimes
- understated
, sometimes
- blaring score isnt crisp
and clear
,
and always right on tghe mark
, enhancing the moods created by the animated scenery
. as far as the subtitles go
, i have to say that they
' re among the most easily
- readable subtitles i
' ve ever seen for
_ anything
_
. large enough thta they don
' t strain the eyes
, bu small enough not to conceal too much of the screen
.
al
though it does have several action sequences in it
, most notably the climactic conclusion
,
_ patlabor
_ is foremost not an action movie
.
al
though it is a superbly
- realized film
, it relies infact large part upon prior familiarity wtih some of the characters to carry the stoy
,
and that could detract from some people
' s enjoyment
