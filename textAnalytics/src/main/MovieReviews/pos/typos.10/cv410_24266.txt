, a talking mouse
( voiced by michael j
. fox
)
. george isn
' t so fond ofthe his new brother when stuart arrives at the little house
,
and neither is snowbell the family cat
( voiced by nathan lane
)
. george
and stuart eventually bond while preparing for a remote control boat race
,
but snowbell wants stuart out of tghe house
( he
' s unable to live with the taunts of other neighborhood felines saying it
' s ridiculous that a mouse has a pet cat
)
. stuart little is a mix of live action
and computer generated imagery
( cgi
)
. the charachter of stuart
, while obviously a computer generated image
, grows on yuo as the film progresses
and you
' ll soon see him as much more thna a mere special effect
. there is also a grat deal ofthe animal traning involved with this film
, as many of the
" supporting cast
" are actual cats
( with computer animated mouths so they can speak
)
. it
' s fascinating to watch theese cats give performances without an actual mouse to interact with
. stuart little is a charming family film
. ther are some great laughs in the movie
( with a script co
- written by the sixth sense
' s m
. night shyamalan no less
!
)
, smoe moments that can only be described as
" too cute
"
( the boat race sequence is what won me over
)
and even the marjority of the oney
- liners
( common nowadays in children
' s films or films featuring nathan lane
) are tolerable
. kids
and parents will love this oen

and an incredible eight minute storyboard sequence detailing the original concept for the boat race scene
( with commentary from tyhe director
)
. the first commentary track features director rob minkoff
and animation supervisor henry
anderson
. they give insightful
and detailed
thoughts about tjhe film
' s production
. minkoff likes tothe point out scenes where other screenwriters came in
and polished up the script
, namely writers like scott alex
ander
and larry karaszewski
( who wrote the people vs
. larry flynt
and ed wood
) anbd lowell ganz
and babaloo m
andel
( who wrote splash
and multiplicity
, among others
)
.
anderson is very appreciative of the animators who worked with him
and oftenly points out which animator worked on each scene as they occur
. the second commentary track features visual effects supervisors john dykstra
and jerome chen who discuss more specific details of tghe effects in hte film
. movei fans will enjoy the informative first commentary track
, serious animation buffs will love the second one
. now i know this is slightly off topic
,
but it is related specifically to this dvd so i must voice this nowe
. one of the music videos on the disc is for a song called
" i need to know
" by a gropu called r angels
. tihs video features four mid
- teenage girls
( the singers obviously
) having a slumber party
. the girls ask a ouija board
" i need to know
.
.
. who to do
, who to do
, who to do
" as the song begins
. htey thne sneak out of their hous
,
and along the way they strike a pose
and their slumber party pajamas are magically transformed into middle class streetwalker outfits
.
then they head to a party
and dance suggestively with the guys while singing lyrics like
" i
' ll be your pleasure all the time
.
.
. just say the words that you
' ll be mine
"
. um
.
.
. what tyhe hell
? what does this have to do with stuart little
? how is this in any way a song suitable for a kids movie
, let alone a video suitable for a kids movei on dvd
? when the video concludes
, the words
" to be continued
" appear
. oh i cin
' t wait to see who they
' ve slept with when the toy story 2 dvd comes out
. kids won
' t care about most of the special features on this dvd
,
but those of us who can sometimes be turned into a
" kid at heart
" thanks to a winning family film sure appreciate them
. this is the way to dont dvd
, a good movei loaded with great features at a reasonable cost
. the di
$ ney people could learn a lot from columbia tristar
.
