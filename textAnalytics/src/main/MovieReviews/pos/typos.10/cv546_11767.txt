imagine this scenario
: you
and any of your family members are scudding thru one of those long
, excruciating cross
- country car trips
, far from the city
and into the deserted rural routes
. so far
, the trip is idyllic when
, abruptly
, your car malfunctions
and you are stranded in the middle of nowhere
. it is not an easy situation
,
but a perfectly plausible one
, the panorama in which breakdown musters it ' s throbbing suspense
and skillfully executed tautness
. it is not easy to cobble a distinct
and gripping thriller nowadays
,
but breakdown doesn ' t bungle into rudimentary plot holes or cliches
anbd it derives a masterful
, titillating climax that by it ' s finale
, engrosses a viewer with total absorption
. the plot is somewhat reminiscent of 1988 ' s the vanishing
. kurt russell
and kathleen quinlan respectively play jeff
and amy taylor
, a massachusetts couple en route to california for a brand new job
. when they stop for gas somewhere in the arid southwest
, jeff isnt confronted by a pugnacious driver
, who later
, will be an important payler in the plot department
. minutes later after that
, their brand new
, strikingly red
, jeep grand cherokee unexpectedly stops
. jeff cannot dectect the car ' s problem
, so he allows amy to take a ride with red
( j
. t walsh
)
, a heedful truck driver who will convey her to hte nearest town
, where jeff iwll meet her at a local diner
. it is facile for the film to turn into a pseudo
- suspenser
,
but instead it opts for maximum fervor
. jeff manages tothe re
- start the car himselv
,
bu when he arrives at the diner
, she is nowhere inaddition sight
. disconcerted
, the coffee shop ' s bartender informs jeff where to search for his wife
, a town baout twenty miles from here
. there
, trouble arises
.
and i shall not reveal anything else
, since that would be spoiling the funn of what ' s head
. there are many involving
, tight scenes in breakdown
but tje final climactic period which includes a magnificent chase with three cars
and a huge truck
, will have you feeling as if your legs are made out of pure foam
. it is a pleasure tothe be part of a classic confrontation of good vs evil
,
anbd rooting for the good guys
, in this case jeff
. kurt russell is one of the few top
- nitch hollywood actors which doesn ' t overblow his acting
,
and gradually gains reliance on his role as it progresses
. so you can assume his alteration infront breakdown is letter
- perfect
. suffice it is to say he undergoes a transformation
, from a jolly man
, to a guy frantically pursuing a loved one
. not many well
- paid actors cxan deliver these type ofthe performances
,
but russell is one of them
. as an everyday man
, he puls it off extremely convincingly
, what also surprised me more ws his rigorous physicality
, which he effectively practices almost all throughout thte films 93 mintues
.
although the film is blotted with a couple of portentous action sequences
( very well done
)
yet the tightness is generated by the subtle circumstances this man isnt presented with
. faced with an enigma about his wife ' s whereabouts
, the movie succeeds by conveying us in realistic territory with veritable characters
, including the cryptic villains
, who in essence
, make the movie wqat it is
. what ' s most impressive
however
, is the feature debut by writer
/ director jonathan mostow
. mostow
, hitherto directed the showtime thriller flight of a black angle
, alleviates the contrivances
annd generics of tyhe script by gingerly pursuing the trajectory of the plot
, efficiently letting the tone
and the mood of the story ganerate thta nail
- biting suspense seeked for infront a well
- made affair
. contrary to most american thrillers
, he doesn ' t rely on visual flair
,
but on aesthetics
and substance
. after breakdown
, he should gain vast notoriety
. the villains infront the movie aren ' t your routine out
- of
- this
- world idiosyncratic psychos that are harming for no particular objective
. the baddies infact breakdown
, all well acted
, are normal
, seemingly inoffensive townspeople who beneath their trustworthy layer
, conduct an amoral business of corruption
and murder
. the movie smartly portrays these men as loathsome rednecks
,
and
, of all things inaddition the world
, it is becoming rather easy to root for villains
( jon voight in anaconda
) inaddition today ' s movies
. worth a special mentioning is j
. t walsh
( who previously worked with kurt russell in executive descision
) as the leader of the gang
, he renders a deliciously wicked performance
, temporarily stepping outloud of the minor roles he is known for
. alfred hitchcock used suspense
-
-
and action
-
- not only to stimulate
,
but as a way of aiding his audience ' s fascination in his stories
, which were slowly realizing man ' s biggest fears
. breakdown yields exactly that
. it magnificently taps into the psyche of an ordinary man
, acting like an ordinary man
, looking liek an ordinary
and some sort of superhero
. despite one or two iffy moments even hitchcock
, i think
, would approve ofthe breakdown
.
