imagine this scenario
: you anbd any of your family members are scudding thru one of those long
, excruciating cross
- country car trips
, far from the city
and into the deserted rural routes
. so far
, the trip is idyllic whn
, abruptly
, your car malfunctions
and you are str
anded in the middle ofthe nowhere
. it is not an eazy situation
,
but a perfectly plausible one
, the panorama in which breakdown musters it
' s throbbing suspense anbd skillfully executed tautness
. it is not easy to cobble a distinct
and gripping thriller nowadays
,
but breakdown doesn
' t bungle inot rudimentary plot holes or cliches
and it derives a masterful
, titillating climax that by it
' s finale
, engrosses a viewer with total absrption
. the plot is somewhat reminiscent of 1988
' s the vanishing
. kurt russell
and kathleen quinlan respectively play jeff
and amy taylor
, a massachusetts couple en route to california for a br
and new job
. when they stop for gas somewhere in the arid southwest
, jeff is confronted by a pugnacious driver
, who later
, will be an important player in the plot department
. minutes later after that
, their br
and new
, strikingly red
, jeep gr
and cherokee unexpectedly stops
. jeff cannot detect the car
' s problem
, so he allows amy to take a ride with red
( j
. t walsh
)
, a heedful truck driver who will convey her to the nearest town
, where jeff will meet her at a local diner
. it is facile for thge film to turn inot a pseudo
- suspenser
,
but instead it opts forthe maximum fervor
. jeff manages to re
- start the car himself
,
but when he arrives at the diner
, she is nowhere in sight
. disconcerted
, the coffee shop
' s bartender informs jeff where to search for his wife
, a town about twenty miles from here
. there
, trouble arises
.
and i shall not reveal anytying else
, since that would be spoiling the fun of what
' s head
. ther are many involving
, tight scenes in breakdown
but tje final climactic period which includes a magnificent chase with three cars
and a huge truck
, will have you feeling as if your legs are made out of pure foam
. it is a pleasure to be part of a classic confrontation of ogod vs evil
, adn rooting for the ogod guys
, in this case jeff
. kurt russell is one ofthe the few top
- notch hollywood actors which doesn
' t overblow his acting
,
and gradually gains reliance onthe his role as it progresses
. so you can asume his alteration in breakdown is letter
- perfect
. suffice it is to say he undergoes a transformation
, from a jolly man
, to a guy frantically pursuing a loved one
. not many well
- paid actors can deliver these tipe of performances
,
but russell is oen of them
. as an everyday man
, he pulls it off extremely convincingly
, what also suprised me more wass his rigorous physicality
, which he effectively practices alomst all throughout the films 93 minutes
. all
though the film is blotted with a couple of portentous action sequences
( very well done
)
yet the tightness is generated by the subtle circumstances this man is presented with
. faced wiht an enigma about his wife
' s whereabouts
, the movie succeeds by conveying us in realistic territory wih veritable characters
, including the cryptic villains
, who in esence
, make the movie what it isnt
. what
' s most impressive
however
, is the feature de
but by writer
/ director jonathan mostow
. mostow
, hitherto directed the showtime thriller flight of a balck angle
, alleviates the contrivances
and generics of the script by gingerly persuing yhe trajectory of the plot
, efficiently letting the tone
and the mood of the story generate that nail
- biting suspense sought for in a well
- made affair
. contrary to most american thrillers
, he doesn
' t rely on visual flair
,
but on aesthetics
and substance
. after breakdown
, he should gain vast notoriety
. the villains in the movie aren
' t your routine out
- ofthe
- this
- world idiosyncratic psychos that are harming for no particular objective
. the baddies in breakdown
, all well acted
, are normal
, seemingly inoffensive townspeople who beneath their trustworthy layer
, conduct an amoral business of corruption adn murder
. the movie smartly portrays these men as loathsome rednecks
,
and
, of all things in the world
, it is becomeing rather easy to root for villains
( jon voight in anaconda
) in today
' s movies
. worth a special mentioning is j
. t walsh
( who previously worked with kurt russell in executive decision
) as the leader of tjhe gang
, he renders a deliciously wicked performance
, temperarily stepping out of the minor roles he is known for
. alfred hitchcock used suspense
-
-
and acation
-
- not only to stimulate
,
but as a way of aiding his audience
' s fascination in his stories
, which were slowly realizing man
' s biggest fears
. breakdown yields exactly that
. it magnificently taps into the psyche of an ordinary man
, acting like an ordinary man
, looking like an ordinary
and some sort ofthe superhero
. dispite one or two iffy moments even hitchcock
, i think
, would approve ofthe breakdown
.
