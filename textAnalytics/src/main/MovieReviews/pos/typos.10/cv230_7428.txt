well
, i ' ll admit when i first heard about this film
( which was before dante ' s peak
) i could just smell wqat ' twister ' had started
. so now it seems that we ' re in a full fledged return to the ' 70 ' s disaster film era
. with ' twister '
, ' dante ' s peak '
, ' volcanoe '
and soon ' flood '
and james cameron ' s extremly expensive ' titanic ' i ' ll say first off i enjoyed ' volcano ' much more than i did ' dantes peak '
. part of that is just being biased as i usually enjoy anything that tommy lee jones appears in
. i ' ve been reading a lot about the movie being ' cheezy ' or ' hokey '
and really didn ' t see or think that once during the entire film
. i git bored easily
and this film didn ' t bore me for a minute
. another thing
,
and boy am i bitching today
!
, that bothers me is whn critics
and such go on about
" well thats not realyl possible
.
" ytou know what
? i couldn ' t give a bloody damn if it ' s possible or not
, really i couldn ' t
. it ' s a freaking movie
annd i don ' t want reality thrown in my face
. i want to be able tothe see the impossible
, the all might
" what if
" to many reviewers have seen one to many movies
! the special effects are the second star to this feature
. they are so amazing that i found it hard sometimes to believe they weere indeed fx
and la wass was not burning to the ground
. tehy did an incredible job
and come oscar time
( if they remember
) some notice better be thrown there way
.
