as i write the review fo the new hanks
/ ryan romantic comedy yuo
' ve got mail
, i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer
and sending it a billion miles away on the internet
. i am also aware that i hvae just spent the last 2 hours watching the world
' s biggest paid commerical for america online
. anbd i wonder
: is that so bad
? well
, the commercial part is
. as for the movei
, well
, as long as i can watch tom hanks annd meg ryan
, i think i
' ll be okay
. to paraphrase james berardinelli
, whose reviews i admire very much
, tom hanks
and meg ryan can act
. they are both wonderful
,
but for all of hanks
' glorious work in serious films
, such as his magnificient performance in saving private ryan
,
and his glorious triumph in philadelphia
, i liuke him best when he
' s suitably obnoxious
. tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious inwhich a romantic comedy when he
' s going to get the girl
: the only question is how
? meg ryan
, america
' s high school sweetheart
, cin ect
. she
' s had a h
andful of memorable performances
, including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally
( i must not mention what she does
, due to the
, well
, um
, you get tghe idea
, anbd if yuo don
' t
, get the movei
-
- fantastic
)
.
but
, i like her best when she
' s
, well
, perky
. she is so adorably perky
/ cute that together with hanks
, they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime
. some people hvea them going back to really old classic romantic couples
,
but i don
' t really nkow
. all i know is that i just like them both
. htey have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that
' s really hard to resist
,
and i
' m not going to even try
. they
' re just really
, really cute
, sweet
,
and charming
. hanks
and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron
, who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle
. here
, the setup is a little different
. kathleen kelly
( ryan
) owns a small children
' s bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago
and passed down to her
. she is successful
, beautiful
,
and dates a well
- known columnist with very radical idea
( kinnear
)
. she is also having an affair
, of sorts
. you see
, kathleen
, with thte h
andle shopgirl
, is secretly emailing ny152
. they have a strikely un
- detailed relationship
: there are no specifics
, anbd they have no idea who each other is
. ny152 happens to be joe fox
( hanks
)
, a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega
- bookstores
, run by his father
( coleman
)
. fox books has decided to open a store on the west side
, right across from a little children
' s bookseller named
" shop around yhe corner
"
, run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly
. every morning
, these two email each other silly
,
and every day
, they fight
" to the death
!
!
"
. it
' s a charming premise
, adn one that works nicely
, balancing the immense troubles kathleen isnt in with the romance she wnats to have
. it also has the great sense of being a classic romance
: there is no
" let
' s have sex tonight
" mantra
, if you
' ll excuse my bluntness
. this is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love
. hmm
. well
, the movie goes through twists
and turns
, having some sad moments
and happy ones
, until at one moment tom hanks
and meg ryan
" hook up
"
, to use modern terminology
, adn kiss their way into happiness
. you know it
' s going to happen
, the question is now
? thankfully
, ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey
, kinnear
, chappelle
,
and a host of others
, including a great scene involving brothers
, aunts
,
and twpo sweet kids
. it
' s all cute
and wonderfull
,
and for all of the idealism
, it makes me feel good
. hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside anbd as warm on thte inside as he always is
. he is
, i believe
, america
' s greatest actor
. does he show it here
? nah
.
but he
' s still tom hanks
,
and she
' s still meg ryan
. wich isnt what this movei boils down to
. it
' s pure confection
. all yhe bits about tyhe godfather
, the jokes
, the superb script
, it
' s all really sweet
. there are soem immense flaws
, liuke pacing
. the last third of the movie really doesn
' t work as well as i would have liked
,
and for a romantic comedy
, it
' s slow
. once hanks knows the secret
, it gets really slow
. i even looked at my watch a couple times
, to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting fo
, so that i could get home at a reasonable hour
. the other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated
. e
- mail
? when my kids are my age
, i don
' t know wqat we
' ll be using
.
but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody
,
and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better thna anyone in movie istory
. they just work together
,
and it
' s nice tothe see
. it gives you
, well
, a smile
. the script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious
,
and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake
. i was arguing withthe my father onthe the drive back hmeo on what the purpose of movies was
. i
' ve always believed tath movies are very powerful
, very powerful indeed
. you see
, mankind has three abilities he needs to survive
: the ability to think
, entertain
,
and procreate
. movies can definitely do the first two
, adn as for the third
, well
, i
' d rather not think baout that
. i always
thought films that made you tihkn enlightened ytou
and made you see something from another viewpoint
,
and that films thgat entertained you were good
, because you forgot about your troubles
and
thought about something nice for a night
.
and i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks hasnt had
. hanks was the driving force behind one ofthe the year
' s best films in saving private ryan
, which is one of those thinking films that truly made somone wonder about the world
. he
' s also half of the glue behind the year
' s best example of pure entertainment
. tom hanks
and meg ryan are magical
, as is this movie
. it
' s a sweet
, lovley affair wih a technology twist
. it may be a long commercial
,
but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face
.
