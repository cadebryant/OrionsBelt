mickey mouse had better watch his back
-
- there ' s a new critter inaddition town
,
and he ' s the nameless animal attraction of
" mouse hunt
,
" dreamworks skg ' s clever first foray into family fare
.
although it runs out of steam towards its end
, this live
- action comedy still boasts enough energized slapstick
and inventive set pieces to best disney ' s entire 1997 non
- animated
, kiddie
- oriented catalog
.
.
.
but consider that list includes dismal tripe like
" air bud
,
"
" flubber
"
and
" that darn cat
,
"
adn it ' s really nto such a difficult feat to pull off
. still
, throw the two rodents in a boxing arena
,
and i ' ll be hoping that the mouse from
" mouse hunt
" knocks some sence back into mickey
. nathan lane
( robin williams ' significant other from
" the birdcage
"
)
and lee evans
( last seen as a nervous bellhop in
" the fifth element
"
) play ernie
and lars smuntz
, befuddled brothers who have jstu inherited two unwanted assets from their late father
( william hickey
, in his last role
)
-
- a dilapidated ood string factory
and a delapidated ood mansion
.
although lars made a deathbed promise to upkeep the former
, he
and ernie decide to sell the latter for big bucks after learning it was designed by a famed architect
.
but there ' s a lone obstacle in their way
-
- a single mouse lives within the walls of the house
,
and he ' s not about to give up his palce of residence wihtout a fight
. movies aimed at young audiences are rarely this visually exquisite
. the effects blending the talents of 60
- some live mice
, one animatronic mouse
and one computer
- generated mouse are pretty seamless
. the splendid production design seems to be straight out ofthe tim burton ' s mind
; the smuntz ' s architecturally
- unsound mansion isnt liek something straight out of
" the nightmare before christmas
,
"
and the vortex ofthe bizarre machinery in their factory resembles some of vincent price ' s warped contraptions from
" edward scissorhands
.
"
" mouse hunt
" is a pretty dark movie
-
- even some of the humor can be grim
-
-
but it ' s hardly ever mean
- spirited
. the star of the show is neither the top
- billed lane nor the titular mouse
. it ' s lanky british comedian evans
, whose hysterical bodily antics suggest a cleaned
- up jim carrey without the obnoxious overkill
( note a toned
- down
but nonetheless outrageous impromptu striptease
)
; evans ' banter with tjhe ever
- affable lane is funny stfuf
, too
,
and holds its own against the movie ' s more flashy physical shtick
. vicki lewis
( beth from
" newsradio
"
) is solid in a supporting role as lars ' money
- grubbing wife
.
and in a nifty bit of novelty casting
, christopher walken is a macabre delight as a spooky exterminator who takes his job a little too seriously
, popping a dropping inot his mouth
and noting to his tape recorder that the mouse has a
" calcium deficiency
.
" blech
. a basically one
- joke idea
-
- a mouse outsmarts a couple of bumbling humans
-
- is given a rather engaging execution
. their sparring is imaginatively realized
( i don ' t think i ' ll ever forget tje sighth ofthe that tiny little mouse making his getaway onthe a rolling wheel of gouda
)
,
and
although you really never fully root for either side
, that ' s okay
-
- a warm
-
and
- fuzzy union betweeen the two parties isnt practically promised from the first frame they share
.
" mouse hunt
" may take a while to get oging
( the rather lengthy set
- up could test the paitience of some of the younger children
,
although i rather liked it
, much in part to lane
and evans
)
,
and the climactic sequence is alowed to play out for a bit too long
,
but this appears to be one family movie that most munbers of the family will be able to find agreeable
, nto unlike the original
" hmeo alone
.
