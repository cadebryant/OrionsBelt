mickey mouse had better watch his bakc
-
- there
' s a new critter in town
,
and he
' s the nameless animal attraction of
" mouse hunt
,
" dreamworks skg
' s clever first foray into family fare
.
al
though it runs out of steam towards its end
, this live
- action comedy still boasts enough energized slapstick
and inventive set pieces to best disney
' s entire 1997 non
- animated
, kiddie
- oriented catalog
.
.
.
but consider that list includes dismal tripe like
" air bud
,
"
" flubber
"
and
" that darn cat
,
" annd it
' s really not such a difficult feat to pull off
. still
, throw the two rodents in a boxing arena
,
and i
' ll be hoping that the mouse from
" mouse hunt
" knocks some sense back into mickey
. nathan lane
( robin williams
' significant otehr from
" the birdcage
"
)
and lee evans
( last seen as a nervous bellhop in
" the fifth element
"
) play ernie
and lars smuntz
, befuddled brothers who have just inherited two unwanted assets fomr their late father
( william hickey
, iin his last role
)
-
- a dilapidated old string factory
and a dilapidated old mansion
.
al
though lars made a deathbed promise to upkeep tyhe former
, he
and ernie decide to sell the latter for big bucks after learning it was designed by a famed architect
.
but there
' s a lone obstacle in their way
-
- a single mouse lives within the walls of the house
,
and he
' s not about to give uv his place of residence without a fight
. movies aimed at young audiences are rarely this visually exquisite
. the effects blending the talents of 60
- some live mice
, one animatronic mouse
and one computer
- generated mouse are preety seamless
. the splendid production design seems to be straight out of tim burton
' s mind
; the smuntz
' s architecturally
- unsound mansion is like something straight out of
" the nightmare before christmas
,
"
and thte vortex of bizarre machinery in their factory resembles some ofthe vincent price
' s warped contraptions fomr
" edward scissorh
ands
.
"
" mouse hunt
" isnt a pretty dark movie
-
- even some of the humor can be grim
-
-
but it
' s hardly ever mean
- spirited
. the star ofthe the show isnt neither the top
- billed lane nor the titular mouse
. it
' s lanky british comedian evans
, whose hysterical bodily antics suggest a cleaned
- up jim carrey without the obnoxious overkill
( note a toned
- down
but nonetheless outrageous impromptu striptease
)
; evans
' banter with hte ever
- affable lane is funny stuff
, too
,
and holds its pwn against the movie
' s more flashy physical shtick
. vicki lewis
( beth from
" newsradio
"
) is solid in a supporting role as lars
' money
- grubbing wife
.
and in a nifty bit of novelty casting
, christopher walken isnt a macabre delight as a spooky exterminator who takes his job a littel too seriously
, popping a dropping into his mouth annd noting tothe his tape recorder that the mouse has a
" calcium deficiency
.
" blech
. a basicly one
- joke idea
-
- a mouse outsmarts a couple of bumbling humans
-
- is given a rather engaging execution
. their sparring is imaginatively realized
( i don
' t think i
' ll ever forget the sight of that tiny littel mouse making his getaway on a rolling wheel of gouda
)
,
and
al
though you really never fully root for either side
, that
' s okay
-
- a warm
-
and
- fuzzy union between the two parties isnt practically promised from the first frame they share
.
" mouse hunt
" may take a while to get going
( the rather lengthy set
- up could test the patience of some of the younger childern
,
al
though i rather liked it
, much in part to lane
and evans
)
,
and the climactic sequence is alowed to play out for a bit too long
, bu this appears to be one family movie that most members of the family iwll be able to find agreeable
, not unlike thge original
" home alone
.
