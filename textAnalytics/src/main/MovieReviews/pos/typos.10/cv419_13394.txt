the rich man
' s wief is oney of those movies like final analysis or body double
, where the story
and characters are so one
- dimensional
and contrived that you know you shouldn
' t be enjoying yourself
.
but somehow
, the movei just tries so hard that you begin to forgive it
and get into the swing of things
. not thyat it
' s bad
, it
' s jsut that it
' s been done before
;
and better
, in my opinion
. i realize that tihs is goign to sound pretty bizarre
,
but it
' s probably the best analogy that i can come up with right now
; you know how when you see a spider or something in your toilet
, striving helplessly to get out
,
and instead of jstu flushing him
, you end up kind of rooting for the little guy
? that
' s basicaly how i felt about htis movie
. i mean
, it
' s not very good
,
but it
' s not completely bad either
. the wife of the title is josie potenza
( played nicely by halle berry
)
. she is married to tony
( christopher mcdonald
.
.
. you nkow
, the guy who looks like joe piscapo
)
, a really stressed
- out buisnessman who drinks way to much
and doesn
' t give josie the attension she deserves
(
* cough
, cough
*
)
. thus
, she is driven into the arms of another man
, jake golden
( clive owen
)
. near the beginning of the film
, josie decides to try
and wrok things out with tony by dumping jake
and going on a vacation to a remote cabin in the woods
. once there
,
however
, tony has to leave almost immediately due to business details
( i
' m still not quite sure what line of work he
' s in
)
. making the best of her situation
, josie stays there
and begins making tghe rounds at the local bars
. one night
, she meets a stranger named cole
( peter greene
, finally getting a meaty role
)
. they have dinner together
,
and eventually
, both josie
and the audiance start to realize that cole is homicidal
. after learning that she is not happily married
, cole offers tothe
" tkae care
" of the problem
. managing to escape from the psychotic maniac
, josie returns home
and starts a reconciliation with her estranged
and very wealthy husb
and
.
but
then one night
, cole shows up
.
.
.
and here is where the fun begins
. fomr this point on
, it
' s going to be a no
- holds
- barred cliche
- fest
, ripping off eveyr movie from strangers on a turain to the usual suspects
. this is why most critics panned this movie when it first cameback out
.
and for the most part
, they
' re right
; the rich man
' s wife has nary one orginial bone in it
' s body
.
but who cares
? if you
' re looking for good ol
' dumb suspense movie
, you can
' t do much better than this
.
and if you suspense buffs aren
' t already sold
, it has a killer of an ending too
.
