. one ofthe the best thigns about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder
and analize things infact your own
, everyday life that you might not have
thought much of otherwise
. with some films it might be just a secondary issue
,
but with
` dark city
' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing
and theorizing baout human memmory
and how it defines who we are
, which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully
- constructed film with the kind of story
and setting that could only happen in a movie
. there
' s an old role
- playing computer game called
` d
? ja v
?
' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can
' t remember who he is
, where he is
and how he got there
. the goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out
and along the way overcome a conflict
. the premise tothe this film is nto unlike that game
, only htis time we don
' t hve control over the protagonist
. we begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living inspite an extremely dark
and dirty city
( actually
, it
' s more than just the city
, it
' s the wohle reality
) that isn
' t just that neo
- gothic look
( a la
` batman
,
'
` blade runner
,
'
)
,
but is so fully developed it
' s almost a different genre completely
. later he wiull learn that his nmae is john murdoch
( sewell
)
,
but forthe now he has no idea what
' s going on other thna thge fact something is not right
. the fact there
' s a dead body in thge corner goes tothe enhance the feeling of paranoia
and a mysterious
, hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also vyer chilling
. this opening scene alone goes a long way to deifne the setting of the film
and its bizarre
, horrific tone
. the man doesn
' t know who he is nor where he
' s going
and it
' s interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize
and identify with him
. in fact
, this is the way all stories beign since it
' s impossible to know the history of a character
, their feelings
, values
, morals
, etc
. util after we
' ve observed them for a while
. bu in this case
, the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization
, developing the mood
and outlining the story
. eventually
, some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police
. we met inspector frank bumstead
( hurt
)
, a quiet
, unemotional
, soft
- spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for smoe time
. two other importan characters are aslo introduced
: dr
. daniel p
. schreber
( sutherl
and
)
, a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john
' s doctor
;
and emma murdoch
( connelly
)
, a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film
- noir movies
. it was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film
. he also contacts emma
, which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex
, mysterous back story
.
but absolutely nothing is as it appears tothe be in
` dark city
,
' which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion
and vertigo
. everything the filmmakers want us tothe see has some significance
- considering how intricate the detail is to every single shooted
, its lighting
, art direction
and overall production design
, they don
' t seem to be able to afford any gratuities
.
however
, that might also be what
' s keeping it from reaching its maximum potential
. by continuing to follow john as he w
anders around this strange place
, so much unlike the real world we know
, we come to realize that it
' s all a hoax
. everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to underst
and what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction
. bu
, as thge film
' s tagline says
,
` lsat night
, one of us went off
.
' for reasons that are never clearly explained
, it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive
( a process known as
` tuning
'
)
. the aliens
, which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin
, also possess the power en masse
and use it to change the city every night at midnight
. at the same time all the humans fall asleep
and after tje changes are made
, htey awake
and either continue where they left off or begin a newyorker life they have no idae they did not have until
then
. this premise certainly is interesting
and director
and co
- screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistantly mysterious in this regard
. he does provide some explanations such as that dr
. schreber is an assistant to
` the strangers
' becuase he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form
. thge aliens mix
and match the memories of the city
' s population to see who wiull change
and who will not
. in yhe process this creates for a good deal of deep
,
thought
- provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world
.
however
, where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is
. the main characters are all closely intertwined within thge seemingly complex muder mystery which never actually happened
,
yet when they start to go through soem ofthe the expected emotions it comes off as distant
, static
and cold
( medicore performances by hurt annd connelly don
' t halp either
)
. for example
, john realizes emma is not
and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her
,
yet in some scenes crucial to the film
' s plot
, we are expected to believe they dont have a genuine lvoe for earch other
, which is also part of the film
' s climax annd ending
.
and that
' s what proyas seems to be inferring with yhe film
,
but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense
. ironically
, this is what made his first film
` the crow
' work so well
, whcih had a similar theme of struggling to find hope
and the human spirit within a nearly identical
, dark twisted world
. withthe
` dark city
' the messanger seems to be mistaken for the message
. still
, the film is by no means bad
and is consistently intertaining
and enjoyable
. there
' s a lot to like here
, most notably the sheer visual look
and style of it all which accounts forthe at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does
. the story as a hwole is one ofthe the most original to come out of hollywood in years
.
` dark city
' is what the movies are all about
- the escape from the real world
.
