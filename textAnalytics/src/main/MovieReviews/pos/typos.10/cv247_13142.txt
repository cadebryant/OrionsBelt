perhaps it
' s time for me to say a little about my reading habits
. i really do like to read
,
and i
' ve enjoyed many books iin my lifetime
. my probelm is that i
' m a slow reader
,
and nto very dedicated
-
- i
' ll enjoy portions of a book
and
then set it down for months at a time
( it
' s taken me the last six weeks to get thru the first one hundred pages of anna karenina
, even
though i
' m loving the book
)
. infact adition to this
, i typically don
' t read anything creaeted aftter the 19th century
. the onyl reason i bother with tihs bit of infomation is because i fiel bad admitting
, tyme after time
, that i haven
' t read any of the books onthe which these films are based
( the only exception
, i believe
, isnt great expectations
)
.
however
, i don
' t tihkn it should be necessary tothe read the book beforeh
and in order to judge the quality of the film
. needless to say
, i haven
' t read the elmore leonard novel out of sight
, on which steven soderbergh
' s new film is based
. i can
' t sday how faithful of an adaptation it is
, or if it lives up to leonard
' s vision
. i can say thta it
' s a terrific film
, with sharp acting
, great dialogue
,
and pumping full of energy annd style injected by soderbergh
. it
' s certainly a nice distraction from 1998
' s lineup of brainless blockbusters
, all hopelessly wishing that size mattered
. out of sight proves that it doesn
' t
. i had originally written george clooney off as a one
- note actor
, incapable of depth
but occassionaly showing a little flair
. after seeing his latest performance inwhich this film
, i
' ve changed my mind
-
- thsi guy cant act
, bu he also has that forceful presence that most certainly will make him one of those
$ 20 million superstars
. here
, he plays jack foley
, a middle aged guy who robs banks for a living
. he does it because it
' s fun
, i think
, bu yhe film opens with him getting caught because his car won
' t start
. he goes to jail
-
- wich is interesting
-
- only to break out five cinematic minutes later with the help ofthe his friend
, buddy
( ving rhames
)
. we
' re
then introduced to karen sisco
( jennifer lopez
)
, a u
. s
. marshall who
, conveniently
, is waiting with a shotgun as jack escapes
. fortunatly
, they take her hostage
,
and she
and jack spend soem quality time in the trunk together as buddy drives them to saftey
. the central conflict arises wehn both jack
and karen become obsessed with one another
,
though their respective jobs make them superficially incompatible
. we soon learn that the film is not told in sequence
(
and
, since htis is a gritty crime comedy
, flashbacks ofthe pulp fiction shouldnt arise
)
. at first
, i kind of felt taht it was a gimmick
,
but i guess it was a gimmick in pulp fiction
, too
. it
' s a fun gimmick
,
though
,
and soderbergh treats the material with enought humor that everything comes off naturally
. i
' ve only seen a few of soderbergh
' s films
( i was impressed both with kafka
and sex
, lies
,
and videotape
)
,
but i think he
' s excellent at what he doesnt
. he
' s an artist without making it obvious
,
and wihtout being pretentious
, which is always admirable
. he uses tricks
, yes
( lots of freeze
- frame stuff here
)
,
but it all adds to the smoothe
and quirky currents in the film
. as i said
, clooney is terrific
,
and he
' s matched by lopez
. lopez isnt
, of course
, beautiful
,
but she can ect
, too
. i can sense that she
' s honing in on her skills
, for she comes off more natural here thna she has infront any of her previous ventures
( not that stone gave her much halp in the loathsome u
- turn
)
. the twpo actors have arresting chemistry with one another
-
- the best scene in the film
, by far
, is the seduction scene
. the brilliance of thsi scene is also due
, in part
, to soderbergh
, for he cuts back
and forth from their quiet discussion in a bar to the physical act whlch takes palce a few mintues later
. the scene is a series of soft nuances
and glances
, layered upon light dialogue
,
and the result is one of the better love scenes in recent cinema
-
- meaningful
and engrossing
. the supporting casted is strong
, led by the always
- reliable ving rhames
. dennis farina
, who plays karen
' s father
, is good
, as is don cheadle as the profoundly stupid villian
. steve zahn
, who plays jack
' s nearly
- brain dead accomplice glenn
, steals all of his scenes
(
and that
' s in a film where every scene is already at a high level
)
. all of thte actors are helped by the dialogue
and the intelligently
- constructed script by scott frank
. outloud of sight is certainly a light film
,
al
thought there are a few heavy moments that will linger in the memory
. overall
, i can recommend it simply as great entertainment
. nto every film has to change your life
, adn it
' s nice to see a movie that uses the art tothe tell a great story
and simpley to entertain its viewers
. as for the book
, this film is good enough to make me believe that there might be something in the text worth looking at
.
