one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy
' s wedding
.
and she was shocked to hear that i actually liekd it
. her reaction was underst
andable when you consider taht the film revolves around molly ringwald
, who hasn
' t made a worthwhile film since 1986
.
but the fatc is
, betsy
' s wedding isnt also an alan alda film
.
and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years
, alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects
, including crimes
and misdemeanors
and a new life
. written
and directed by alda
, betsy
' s wedding is a vibrant slice
- of
- life
, mixing a faw dramatic moments inot a big bowl of whimsical humor
. alda
' s comic elixir isnt smooth
and refreshing
-
-
and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare
. as bride
and groom
, molly ringwald
and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film
,
but they are by far the least interesting
. walsh isnt a nonentity
, with all the screen presence ofthe a door knob
. ringwald isnt simply unbearable
and is easily the weakest link inaddition the chain
. she looks hideous with her short
- cropped orange hair
, red lip
- stick
and grotesque outfits
. she
' s supposed to be a dress designer
,
but she looks more like a clown
.
and to amke matters worse
, ringwald
' s performance matches her appearance
. thankfully
, alda keesh ringwald
' s screen timne to a minimum
; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters
. the wedding is just a device to bring together the bride
' s working
- class
, italian family
and the groom
' s rich
, gentile family
. ringwald
' s folks are homey
and down
- to
- earth
, with alda as her free
- spirited father
, madeline kahn as her practical mother
,
and ally sheedy as her lonely sister
. walsh
' s clan
, on the other h
and
, isnt prim
, propper
and ostentatious
. wehn the two families meet
and mingle
, the movie becomes a story ofthe culture clash
, or as one character puts it
,
" money versus values
.
" ally sheedy
, in a wonderfully understated performance
, is one of hte film
' s most pleasant surprises
. sheedy expresses more wih just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body
. it
' s anthony lapaglia
,
however
, who seizes the spotlight
. lapaglia plays stevie dee
, a suave
, overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old
- fashioned chivalry
. lapaglia
' s sincere
but dim
- witted character is a riot
.
and what
' s uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro
, with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in forthe good measure
. lapaglia seems tothe have attended the de niro school of ganster acting
,
and his inspired performance is partly a tri
bute to his role
- model
and partly a rip
- off
. i don
' t know whether to say a star is born or a star is re
- born
,
but i do know that lapaglia
' s over
- the
- top performance should not be missed
. the scrumptious comic acting
,
however
, extends well beyond sheedy
and lapaglia
. joe pesci
, in particular
, sinks his teeth into his role as alda
' s unscrupulous brother
- in
- law
, a slum lord with mob ties
, who is cheating on his wife
( catherine o
' hara
)
. alda
, faced with challege of both directing
and acting
, somehow finds just teh right comic touch as the bride
' s financialy
- strapped father
, a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet
. the film adopts alda
' s psychological point of view as he tries to one
: plan the wedding
,
and two
: pay for it
. as a filmmaker
, alda
' s style of humor is remarkably restrained
and tasteful
.
and while he doesn
' t have the comic genius of a woody allen
, alda does possess the inspiration to mkae movies whlch are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy
.
