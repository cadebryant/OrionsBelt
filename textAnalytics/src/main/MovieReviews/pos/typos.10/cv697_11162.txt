another
' independent film
'
, thsi comedy
, which was brought by miramax for
$ 5 million
, is good fun
. favreau
and vaughn
( the lost world
: jurassic park
, 1997
) play mike
and trent
, two everyday 20somethings on the lookout for women
. the film just basicly follows their plight on the lookout for lurve
, adn along the way we get to meet some of their friends
, see their attempts at chatting uv girls
,
and just basicly get a insight into their lives
. adn all of this is great fun
. swingers doesn
' t rely on huge spacial effects
, or big name stars to provide entertainment
. no
, it just has a great script
and superb little known actors
. the script
, by favreau
, is great
. mike isnt always missing is girlfriend
, who hasn
' t called him for six months
,
and every time he meets a girl
, he alwasy end up telling her about the ex
. the audience feels for this pathetic little man
, thanks to the great script
. vaughn is
' the money
'
( swingers speak for
' the best
'
) as the womanizing trent
, always on the lookout for a new girl
. some of his caht
- up lines are awful
, bu he always seems to get tyhe girl thanks to his
' hard man
' nature
. vaughns character also gets the best laugh in the film
, towords the end in a diner
. the conversations that go on between mike
and trent are great
,
but it never quite reaches tarantino st
andards
( which i suspect the film was trying to reach
.
) there are some excellent
, laugh outloud loud jokes in the film
,
and some superbly funny set pieces
( such as favreau cringe
- worhy battle with a answer machine that always cut him off before he finishes his sentence
. embarrassing to him
, hilarious to the audience
.
) mike
& trents friends are also ogod
,
al
though there characters seem a bit underwritten
,
and we never really learn as much as we would like about them
.
al
though this is primarily mike
and trents film
, it would of been nice to learn a bit more about their friends
. they jsut seem to w
ander aimlessly in tghe background
.
but again
, the lines they say are usually pretty good
, adn they do have smoe funny parts
. it
' s just a shame that they didn
' t have more meatier roles
. the acting is superb
. as said above
, vaughn is superb as trent
, he
' s definitely the best thing in the film
. favreau is also good
, acting as
' the little man
' veyr well
,
and the way he always feels sorry for himself is very funny
. graham
( boogie nights
, 1997
) has a small
but good role as lorraine
, a girl mike finally falls in love whith
. she hardly features in the film at all
,
but she still manages to amke an impact on the audience
. swingers
,
then
, is funny
,
but it does have some flaws
. firstly
, the running time is a bit too short
. the film comes to an abrupt halt
,
and i actually wanted the film tothe carry on longer
. it never really comes to a satisfying conclusion
, which is a shame
, as most films are too long
! also
, this type of film has been done too many times
, such as sleep with me
( 1994
)
.
but these small flaws don
' t really spoil what is a funny
, entertaining comedy
.
