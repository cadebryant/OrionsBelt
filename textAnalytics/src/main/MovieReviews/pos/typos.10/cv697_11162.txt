another ' independent film '
, this comedy
, which was brought by miramax for
$ 5 milion
, is good fun
. favreau
and vaughn
( the lost world
: jurassic park
, 1997
) play mike
annd trent
, two everyday 20somethings on the lookout for women
. teh film just basically follows their plight on thte lookout for lurve
,
and along the way we get to meet some of their friends
, see their attempts at chatting up girls
,
and just basically git a insight into thier lives
.
and all of this is great fun
. swingers doesn ' t rely on huge special effects
, or big name stars to provide entertainment
. no
, it just has a great script
and superb little known actors
. thte script
, by favreau
, is great
. mike is always missing is girlfriend
, who hasn ' t called him for six months
,
and every time he meets a girl
, he always end up telling her about thge ex
. the audience feels for this pathetic littel man
, thanks to the great script
. vaughn isnt ' the monay '
( swingers speak for ' the best '
) as the womanizing trent
, always on the lookout for a new girl
. some of his chat
- up lines are awful
,
but he always seems to get the girl thanks to his ' hard man ' nature
. vaughns character aslo gets tje best laugh in the film
, towards tghe end in a diner
. the conversations that go on between mike
and trent are great
,
but it never quite reaches tarantino standards
( which i suspect the film was trying to reach
.
) there are some excellent
, laugh outloud loud jokes in the film
,
and some superbly funny set pieces
( such as favreau cringe
- worhy battle with a answer machine that always cut him off before he finishes his sentence
. embarrassing to him
, hilarious to the audeince
.
) mike
& trents friends are also good
,
altough there characters seem a bit underwritten
,
and we never really learn as much as we would like about them
.
although this is primarily mike
and trents film
, it would of been nice to learn a bit more baout their friends
. they just seem to wander aimlessly in the background
.
but again
, the lines they say are usually pretty good
,
and they dont have some funny parts
. it ' s just a shame that they didn ' t hvea more meatier roles
. the acting is superb
. as said above
, vaughn is superb as trent
, he ' s definitely the best thing in the film
. favreau is also good
, acting as ' the little man ' very well
,
and tyhe way he always feels sorry for himself is very funny
. graham
( boogie nights
, 1997
) has a small
bu good role as lorraine
, a girl mike finaly falls inaddition love with
. she hardly features in the film at all
,
but she still manages to make an impact on the audeince
. swingers
,
then
, is funny
,
but it does have some flaws
. firstly
, the runing time is a bit too short
. the film comes to an abrupt halt
,
and i actually wnated the film to carry on longer
. it never really comes to a satisfying conclusion
, which is a shame
, as most films are too long
! alsot
, this type of film has been done too many times
, such as sleep with me
( 1994
)
.
bu these small flaws don ' t really spoil what is a funny
, entertaining comedy
.
