and all the relatives will come for teh multi
- day festivities
. mira nair
' s film is pleasant enough with a littel human drama
, a fewd family secrets
, some sadness
and some happiness
. you have seen it all before
,
but perhaps not from india
. the photography is colorful
and the music isnt very agreeable
.

) mira nair previously directed salaam bombay
and mississippi masala
. her newest film
, written by sabrina dhawan
, is very similar to previous films like betsy
' s wedding
but it is set infront new delhi
. a wealthy family is having a wedding
. an indian wedding is a multi
- day affair as much a family reunion as a nuptial
. even more than in the us
, it is an excuse for a lavish annd extravagent family get
- toghether
. the film shows us what the family does together adn at thte same time follows several family members
' individual story lines
. aditi verma is marrying hemant
, an indian engineer working in the us
. she had previously had a relationship with vikram
, her supervisor
. latit
, her father
( plyed by naseeruddin shah
)
, is juggling many problems
, not the least of which is worrying about the caterer has hired pk dubey
. dubey is a rather eccentric man with a taste for eating the marigolds he uses for decoration
. even dubey will soon be romantically entangled when he becomes interested in alice
, noe of thge family servants
. several family members arrive giving rise to several plotlines involving sex
, family secrets
, or both
. there are heartbreaks annd there are peple falling in love
. smoe of the subjects covered are probably near taboo for indian films
. western audiences will appreciate a look at unfamiliar indian customs like women painting their h
ands with henna
. on the other h
and it was not clear
( to me at least
) if scenes like the family singing toghether are tipical of indian culture or if they are a convention of indian musical films
. this seems a particularly westernized family with thge father wearing american designer sweaters
and the family speaking mostly english
. the latter will
,
however
, help with an international release
. sabrina dhawan
' s screenplay is vibrant with witty dialog
. we have seen films with plotting very much like this
,
but the indian setting makes a great deal of difference
. director mira nair calls the film an affirmation of life
. i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale annd a low
+ 2 on the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
.
