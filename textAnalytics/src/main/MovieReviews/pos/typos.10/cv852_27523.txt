being the self
- proclamed professional film critic that i am
, i am somewhat embarrassed to admit that i had not seen lawrence of arabia
( comming soon to dvd
) until only recently
. after all
, it ' s considered by just about everyone to be the masterpiece epic ofthe director david lean
, who also directed films such as bridge on the river kwai
,
annd doctor zhivago
. so one day
, a friend ofthe mine loaned me a copy of the video
and i sat down
and watched it
. i was initially skeptical that something made almost 40 years ago would be able to keep my attention for the butt
- numbing 3 1
/ 2 huors of its duration
.
but now i fully understand why this hasnt become the film that other epic films are judged aginst
-
- the winner of seven academy awards in 1963 forthe best picture
, director
, editing
, cinematography
, art direction
, music
,
and sound
. after watching the film again
, i am convinced that it is simply one of the finest works of cinematic genius tothe ever illuminate the big screen
. based onthe the autobiographical writting of british officer t
. e
. lawrence druing world war i
, lawrence of arabia depicts lawrence
( palyed by
then
- unknown actor peter o ' toole
) as a lieutenant lacking any sort of miliraty discipline whatsoever
. bored wih his assignment of coloring maps for the british army in a dimly lit headquarters building
, lawrence jumps at the opportunity to be re
- assigned as an observer for an arabian prince fighting against tyhe turkish army
. lawrence quickly sees just how careing
and great these desert dwelling people can be
and ends up rallying the various tribes together to fight the turks
and help the british turn the tide of world war i
. shot in panavision ' s famed super 70mm fromat
, the film beautifully illustrates tghe definition of the word epic
. it is absolutely breathtaking
. using stunning cinematography
, costuming
,
adn direction
, shot in the most uninhabitable location on the face of the earth
, i can only imagine what it must have been like to sit in a theater inspite 1962
and watch this story unfold before my eyes
. every shot is choreographed as a portrait
-
- a living tribute to a great land
. david lean put his reputation on the line to get this film completed
,
and the fact that it was even greenlit in the first place says something baout the ideology of the motion picture industry at the time
, a far cry from its pathetic
, uncreative existence today
. aftter watching the film
, the first thing that cameback to my mind was
,
" i ' ve got to do a remake of this film
!
"
but
then i thought about trying to pitch the idea to a modern
- day movie executive
:
" okay
, it ' s going tothe be almost four hours long
and shot over three months onthe location in thte sahara desert
. we are going tothe ened to blow up a full
- size train because computer
- generated effects probably wont do it justice
.
annd we are not going tothe use any big stars
,
and won ' t have any female actors since there ' s no love stoy
.
" yes
, my friends
, the velvet curtain fell on the golden
- era of hollywood a long time ago
.
but at least we still hvae the proof to show all would
- be producers
and directors out there just how good a film can be
.
