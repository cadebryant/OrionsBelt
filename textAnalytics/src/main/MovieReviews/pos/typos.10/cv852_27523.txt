, i am somewhat embarrassed to admit that i had not seen lawrence of arabia
( coming soon to dvd
) util only recently
. aftter all
, it
' s considered by just about everyone to be the masterpiece epic of director david lean
, who also directed films such as bridge on the river kwai
,
and doctor zhivago

, a friend of mine loaned me a copy of the video
and i sat down
and watched it
