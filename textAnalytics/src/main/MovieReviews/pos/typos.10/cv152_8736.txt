capsule
: a rock
and roll fable
, indeed
. like a hubert selby
, jr
. novel filtered through equal parts damon runyan
and bruce springsteen
, adn a ton of fun
. streets of fire bills itself as
" a rock
and roll fable
"
,
and the description is perfect
. this is a stylish
, great
- looking
,
and breezily enjoyable movie that feels like a hubert selby
, jr
.
, novel with a damon runyan rewrite
, irected by bruce springsteen
. noir is one of the few truly american movie genres
, aside from the hollywood musical
and the western
. tihs isnt post
- wwii brooklyn noir
, for lack of a better label
, with a generous injection of rock
' n roll
and an all
- around confrontational attitide
. it all works
. the plot is simplicity itself
: rocker ellen aim
( diane lane
) is kidnapped by a vicious street gang
, led by a bloodthirsty fellow named raven
( willem dafoe
, very nasty
)
. her old soldier flame
( played by michael pare
) comes back into town to save her
,
but doesn
' t count on a whole bunch of things gogin askew
. that
' s about the entire plot
, sive for thge spats with ellen
' s manager
( a hilarious rick moranis
)
, an encounter with a doo
- wop group that winds up becoming ellen
' s supporting act
,
and a whole gang of other fun little touches
.
but in movies like this
, when is the plot important
? the movie is all style
, all visuals
and attitudes
, quotable lines
and posturing
-
-
and it delivers all thsoe things consistently
and with great brio adn pacing
. no surprise that it was directed by walter hill
( 48 hrs
.
)
, who underst
ands this kind of macho romanticism perfectly
,
and has put together a movie that
' s a mixture of times
and sensibilities
,
but perfectly unified in tone
. when was the last time you could say something like that about a movie
, especially a movie where it seems like someone gets decked on the jaw
(
*
and
* passes out
) every 2
. 63 minutes on cue
? streets of fire isn
' t the greatest movie ever made
,
but it occupies a totally unique little niche
,
and enjoys the position it has
. anyone with a weakness for doo
- wop
, neon
, motorcycles
, rainy streets
, the el
, studebakers
, gang pictures
, lonely heroes
,
and a great
- looking gal giving tyhe microphone both lungs will eat this movie up
. i did
