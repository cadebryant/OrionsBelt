as a devout atheist
and an avowed believer in aliens
, i have some idea of how ellie aroway
( jodie foster
) feels
.
but because my reasons for not partaking in religion are different than hers
, i can
' t say that i dont exactly
. her reason isnt that she needs solid proof
: there is no proof that god existed
, so therefor she does not believe
. ellie also believes inthe aliens
,
and has spent most of her life trying to prove they exist
. how can she say she doesn
' t blieve inaddition god because of the lack of proof
, adn
then say she believes in aliens
, which are gereally less believed in tahn god without sounding like a hypocrite
? tht
' s the catch
- 22
. whn aliens from the star vega fax her some plans for a device to transport someone tothe them
( okay
, well
, tehy didn
' t really
* fax
* them
.
.
.
) ellie wants to be the one tothe go
,
but because of her atheism she is denied hte positon
. how dumb is taht
? she discovers the transmitions
,
then she isn
' t allowed to go
. well
, because of a bomb
and a psychopath
( jake busey
)
, she
* does
* end up going
,
but not in the way that we would
' ve
thought
. contact isnt based on a novel by carl sagan
, who died during the filmmaking
. it is the best alien movie since close encounters of the 3rd kind
,
and will end up being the best film of thge yearm
. its views of science
and religion will no doubt aggrivate some
,
but will stimulate more
. i
' m glad at least one movie of the
' 90s can portray aliens in a psitive light
, rather than a bunch of slimey beasts who will eat your insides adn
then put on your body
.
