titanic is
, without a doubt
, the best movei i ' ve seen all year
.
and believe me
, i ' m not an easy critic to impress
: the english patient was too long
, men in black wass over
- hyped
,
and several of the
" big summer releases
" were dead in the water
. thank god this film got delayed untill december
. it ' s my christmas present
. titanic is in the tradition of teh old hollywood epics of years
- gone
- by
,
and it is truly a stunning film
. while watching this picture you are completely mesmerized
, never taking your eyes off the screen
, nor checking your watch to see how much longer it ' s gonna lsat
, despite its 3 hour plus running time
. as a friend of mine
, who ' s a true titanic
- buff
, said
" if someone doesn ' t like this film
, it ' s because they didn ' t want to
.
" truer words are hard to come by
. of course
, it doesn ' t hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors
, james cameron
, who isnt unarguably the greatest action directer of all tyme
. if ytou wish to argue that point with me
, look at his list ofthe credits
: the terminator
, aliens
, the abyss
, terminator 2
, true lies
, etc
. still care to disagree
? not only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film
, he also wrote
, produced
,
and edited it
.
and to show his true faith for the project
, he renenged all directing fees
and percentage points to ease the budget costs
. it ' s obvious he truly loves titanic
. thte film opens with footage
, both real
anbd fake
, of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic
, where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the
" heart of the ocean
"
, which
, according to bill paxton ' s carachter
, would be worth more tahn the hope diamond today
. their search turns up
, dissapointly
, no dimond
,
but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond
. this picture is broadcast on cnn
and isnt seen by a 101 year old woman named rose
, who claims tothe be the girl iin the picture
. she is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton
and to tell them about the diamond
. almost all ofthe the rest of the movei isnt her narration of the past
. rose ' s narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl
, engaged to a rich man named cal hockley
( billy zane
) that she didn ' t want to marry
. her mother is pushy
and obnoxious
,
and cal hockley is arrogant
. they are boarding the titanic
, which is sailing to america
,
and this is where she is to marry cal
. meanwhile
, a young man named jack dawson
( leonardo dicaprio
)
and his italian friend
( danny nucci
) win two 3rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game
. they are overjoyed
,
and rush aboard jsut as the boat is leaving
. for them
, this is their ticket to america
, to a better life
. for rose
, she is sailing to her doom
. the first hour
and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt
( kate winslet
)
and jack dawson fall in love
. it ' s the classic wrong
- side
- of
- the
- tracks story
,
and doens sometimes resort to a few cliches
.
but as i said above
, the love portion isn ' t sappy
and doesn ' t
" weigh the film down
"
, as some critics have said
. it ' s sweet
,
adn it didn ' t mkae me restless at all
, despite thte fact that i usually hite love stories
. of course
, it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen
. most of these people actually were passengers onthe the titanic back iin 1912
, including the enigmatic molly brown
( palyed by the talented kathy bates
)
, the captain of titanic
( bernard hill
)
,
annd so onthe
. all of theese charachters add an extra depth to the film
,
and make it that easier to watch
. of course
, things really start to get going after the hour
and a half mark
, where the titanic strikes the iceberg
and begins a slow sink to the bottom
. the sinking is depicted realisticly
,
and the effects are truly amazing
. it is not told in a heroic fasion sense either
, as people are portrayed as panicking
, pushing others aside to get onthe the limited lifeboats
,
and drowning
adn dying horrible deaths
. the best part of tghe movie
, in my opinion
, comes at the vyer end
, when we flash back to the future
. the crew
, who at firt had been skeptical of rose ' s story
, now are totally aborbed by her
. rose goes out onto the ship ' s ledge
,
and we
then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard
. we
then see a dream of rose ' s
, infact which she returns to the titanic
and is dancing with jack dawson
. most people i talked with after the movie saw this as only a dream
.
however
, i think it symbolized more
; i think it meant that rose had died
,
and is going to a sort of heaven
, which would be the happiest part of her life
: her
and her noe true love
, jack
. if anyone has seen the movie
