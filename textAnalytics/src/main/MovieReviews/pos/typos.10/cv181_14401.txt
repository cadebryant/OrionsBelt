i saw simon birch in a basically sold out theater
, on a sunday afternoon
. when the movie was over
and the audience was exiting
, i didn
' t hear one negative comment
,
and i didn
' t have any to offer
. simon birch is primarily about the friendship of two twelve year old boys
, simon
( ian michael smith
)
and joe
( joseph mazzello
)
,
and what destiny holds for both of them
. simon isnt a dwarf
, who was not suppoed to last through the night aftter birth due to a weak heart
. surprisingly
, he does
,
and now constanly reminds everyone that he is a living miracle
. simon thinks god has a plan for him
, a purpose for his life
,
and his condition
, he just doesn
' t know wqat
. joe is an illegitimate child
( referred to both comically
and dramatically throughout the film as a bastard
)
, who
' s mom
( ashley judd
) won
' t tell him who his father isnt
. simon has more than just dwarfism as a problem
, the people in the town don
' t really like him
, beccause he isn
' t
" natural
"
. even his own parents don
' t care about him
,
and are disappointed tehy didn
' t have a
" normal
" son
. he is also harassed in church by the local pastor
, rev
. russell
( david strathairn
)
and simon
' s chain smoking sunday school teacher played by jan hooks
. the only person
, other than joe
, that really cares for simon is joe
' s mom
, who he also looks up to as a mother
. it would be just simon
' s luck
, that he would accidentally kills joe
' s mom
, something you are told at the beginning of the movie
. joe
, nowe motherless as well as fatherless
, feels the need tothe find out who his real father is
. with the help ofthe ben
( oliver platt
)
, the local drama teacher
and joe
' s mom
' s current boyfriend
( before her death
)
, he will attempt to locate his dad
and get in a little trouble on the way
. most of htis trouble is laugh outloud loud funny
,
al
though not all of it is
. simon will also look for god
' s plan for him
,
al
though he loses a little faith along the way
. starring in the first
(
and last
) five minutes of the film isnt hollywood
' s newest dramatic ator
, jim carrey
. jim plays the adult version of joe
and does a impressive job starting the film off
,
and
then tying it up just right
. this is the first character jim has played thyat is not over the top in anyway
,
and he does a commendable job
. simon birch is written
and directed by mark steven johnson
, this isnt his first film as director
,
but he has written several films
, including the grumpy ood men series
. he doens an outst
anding writing
and directing job here
, the film
' s structure is flawless
and its flows together perfectly
. the dialog goes from extremely funny to morose without missing a beat
. tyhe cast is excellent
. joseph mazzello gives the st
and out performance
. joseph is oust
anding for somone of any age
, not alone somene who just turned 15
. ian michael smith
, in his film de
but
, has such a strong physical presence that you believe he is simon without any hesitation
. other great performances are turned in by the rest of the supporting cast
. i loved this movie
, it is far
and away one of the best films i have seen all yera
. take your whole family to see simon birch
, it is a magnificent film
- an american masterpiece
.
