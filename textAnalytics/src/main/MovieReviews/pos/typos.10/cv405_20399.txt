' hip music galore
,
and plenty of t
& a
. having said that
, i enjoied the look
and feel ofthe the movie
,
thought james van der beek gave a solid performance
, loved the slick sounds
,
and yup
, loved that t
& a
! i actually
thought thsi ws a comedy going in
,
but overall
, it plays more towards the dramatic
, than a comedy
. i also enjoyed jon voight
' s performance as the stubborn dick coach
, as well as many of the other character players on the team
. this is not a classic film by any stretch of the imagination
,
but it might teach some kids tyhe hard lessons behind tyhe
" fun
" game of football
, or just allow them to have a good time for about an hour adn forty
- five minutes in the movie theatre
( or in the comfort of their own hmeo
, depending onthe where you watch this stuff
.
) all in all
, i would definitely watch this movie if you like football
, play football or want your kid to succeed in high school football
. you could also watch it if you like teen flicks with a lot of cute guys
and girls running around doing their stuff
.
and did i mention the t
