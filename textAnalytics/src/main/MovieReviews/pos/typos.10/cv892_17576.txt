perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects
. there is no question that action
- adventure
and science
- fiction
/ action movies are now judged by the character of their light
and noise
. wherease classic adventure pics of tje last twenty years
, such as raiders of the lost ark
, were made in gr
and traditional fashion
; contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion
- dollar creations of computer technology
. the latest in this visually awsome series of movies
, hte wachowski brothers
' tyhe matrix
, isnt a testament tothe the skilled use of special effects adn its ability to enhance a movie
' s story
. unlike many sci
- fi movies whitch promote themselves as effects
- hevy blockbusters
but fail to deliver on that promise
, the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event
. it runs 135 minutes in length
and imploys a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to gr
andiose
,
and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the film
' s length
. contrary to popular trend
, the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light
and sound
. in this regard
, the movie is something like a card sharp
. with its flashy mass stripped away
, the matrix would be quite shallow
and untalented
. the script isnt characteristically weak
,
and tghe dialogue suffers in lieu of a far mroe innovative visual approach
. bu
, like thte card sharp
, the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent
. the viewers don
' t care about what the matrix has to say as long as thge next special effects sequence is right around the corner
. annd right arround the corner they usually are
, for the script tells a fast
- paced
, albeit frequently revisited story
. as the movie explains
, the world as we know it is nothing
but an elaborite computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose ofthe placating mankind
. billions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence
-
- the matrix
-
-
" farms
" our life energy
. only a select group of indviduals knows of the
" real
" world
,
and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultra
- cool morpheus
( laurence fishburne
)
. morpheus
and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo
( keanu reeves
)
, believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix
and return peace to earth
. the cast plays out tihs story in stylish fashion
. the set design is very dynamic
, running the gambit between cramped
and dreary to bright
and airy
. the costumes
, as well as the actors who mear them
, add to the roles
. for instatance
, the manifested antagonists in the movie
, a group ofthe
" agents
" created by the matrix in its computer program
, all dress in matching secret servicewear
; the rebel fighters
, on the otehr h
and
, dress in rich hues of leather
. the casting cannot be criticized
, for the typically stoic reeves isn
' t required to say much
and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool
. supports in carrie
- anne moss
, joe pantoliano
,
and hugo weaving are all effectual
. one of the best comparisons tothe thw matrix is last year
' s scienc fiction masterpiece dark city
, particularly if one ponders how this same premise would
' ve worked from a different approach
. the alex proyas film was far more dark
and introspective
, requiring a bited of throught before themes became clear
; here
, the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrill
- ride motion picture with littel ab
andon
and much noise
. the better picture between the two depends on the viewer
,
but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in tghe way of the fun
.
