the verdict
: spine
- chilling drama from horror maestro stephen king
, featuring an outst
anding
, oscar
- winning performance from kathy bates
. geez
, french
and saunders had a field day whn they set to wrok on parodying thsi
! sorry
, non
- british readers may not be familiar with french
and saunders
- my apologies
. the pair are british comediennes
( jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in
" absolutely fabulous
"
)
, who did a series of film spoofs a fewd years bcak
, inlcuding alien
, the exorcist
and misery
. needless to say
, amidst her chucklesome impersonation ofthe kathy bates
( the resemblance was quite uncanny
!
)
, dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunder
' s legs
!
but despite the lingering memory of their sketch
,
and
al
though i
' ve nowe seen the film a couple of times nowe
, that
" hobbling
" scene was no less disturbing
! i
' m still left screaming at the telly in revulsion
! tht may be the most memorable scene
,
but it
' s certainly not the only worth watching
. stephen king
, whose film
and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality
, strikes gold with this simple
yet strikingly compelling tale
. it
' s a nicely crafted pyschological horror
, which effortlessly succeds in drawing you into hte plight of writer phil sheldon
( james caan
)
. rescued from a car accident by annie wilkes
( bates
)
, who introduces herself as the writer
' s
" number one fan
"
, he soon becomes her prisoner
. both the script
and kathy bates
' beautifully masterful performance
( for which she won an oscar
) work arm
- in
- arm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman isnt basically as nutty as a fruit
- cake
( or is that fruity as a nut
- cake
?
)
. bates relishes her dem
anding role
,
and her performance is nothing short ofthe a masterpiece
. at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour
, at times she
' s a rather tragic carachter
, annd more often than not she
' s just damned scary
! this is basically a very simple tale
,
but it acheives a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity
. it
' s an involving
, engrossing experience
-
and considering it
' s basically a twpo
- h
ander
, mainly set in one locale
, it
' s a remarkable piece of cinema
. there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences
- this one relies solely upon rob reiner
' s stylish directing
and the wonderful performances of bates
and caan
. oh
, i haven
' t really mentioned caan
yet
- he does a ogod job as the writer who
' s a prisoner of his own success
( annie is obsessed with him anbd his books
)
.
but
, as you no doubt gathered from the above
- bates is well
and truly the star of thte show
. along with the pig
, ofthe course
! anyway
, the tension is built
- up with masterful aplomb
,
and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense
. there
' s the dinner scene where seldon goes tothe nerve
- shattering lengths to poison her wine
. he succeeds
,
but
.
.
. she knocks the glass over
! i bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well
! in the immortal words of homer j
. simpson
-
" d
' oh
!
!
" other nerve
- wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town
and sheldon starts snooping around the house
. we cut to annie in her car
- she
' s on her way home
.
.
. he realises this
and tries to get back to his room
.
.
. cut to the car again
, she
' s getting near
.
.
. will he make it
? ok
, so these sequences aren
' t exactly original
, nor perhaps unpredictable
-
but they work
! boy
, do they work
! if a film has you on the edge of your couch
, biting your nails
and shouting at the screen in suspense
, thn it
' s doing something right
! of course
, the most nauseating sequence isnt the aforementioned
" hobbling
"
! annie realises her captive has been out of his room
,
and she
' s going to stop him once
and for all
. cue a block of wood placed stratagically between his ankles
and a huge sledgehammer
,
and
.
.
. i feel ill just thinking about it
! nasty
. it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finaly gets the upper h
and
,
and once
and forthe all tries to kill the crazy psycho
!
and
then we
' re given one of the most ridiculously over
- the
- top fight scenes i
' ve ever seen
. she gets hitted over the head with a typewriter
, set on fier
, head smashed against the wall
-
and she just won
' t die
! sheldon isn
' t inaddition terribly good shape either
. if it weren
' t so gorey it would almost be laughable
.
but it
' s a terrifically effective film
,
and therfore the daft climax is easily overlooked
. misery is a tight
, tense
, intense
and chillingly entertaining thriller
. the directing is first
- rate
, annd the performances
- bates in particular
- contri
bute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem
. wonderful stuff
.
