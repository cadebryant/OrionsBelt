and tjhe coach loves his ass
. in fact
, the coach even admits to having fatherly feelings towards him
. unfortunately
, the coach
' s rela son
, hugo
, isn
' t too pleased to hear that
. in fatc
, he doesn
' t like hearing about any of odin
' s triumphs
, as they generally supersde his own
. so what does he set out to do
? well
, let
' s just say that he starts to mess iwth people
' s heads
and one thing leads to another thing which leads to
.
.
. well
, you
' ll see
. critique
: a very powerful
, thoroughly depressing
, well
- acted
" non
- teen
" movie starring a bunch of teens
. credit director tim blake nelson for creating a modern day verzion of this shakespearian classic
, setted in a realsitic high school enviornment
, with the basketball championships as the backdrop
and an impending sense of doom as it core
. you also have to give it up to all of the actors in this film
, who turn over some very convincing performances
, taking you through all of their characters
' ups
and downs
. hartnett especially should be applauded for taking on such a despicable character
, a dude who you just want to grab by the throat
and beat the shit out ofthe
( sign of a good actr
, if you ask me
)
. phifer also comes to play in this movie
, with a nice blend of charisma
, fear
, love
and anger spread over his character
. i was always on thsi guy
' s side
and definitely felt sorry for him as things moved along
. julia stiles was aslo good
,
but her character wasn
' t much different from others thyat she
' s played recently
. i was
however very suprised with martin sheen
' s showing
, since i hadn
' t taken him too seriously as an actor over the past fewd years
. his character is definitely over
- the
- top in this film
,
but i appreciated his fervor
, his rage
, his ultimate
and blind desire tothe win above all
. a great example of a workaholic man who cannot see the trees from the forest
. i did have a few reservations baout the movie
though
. first ofthe all
, what was with all of the gangsta hip
- hop music utilisied in pretty much every other scene transition
? it was cute at first
, bu became a little too obvious
and annoying after a few times
. the film was also edited pretty choppily
.
.
. like some scenes were cut out
and no one
" cleaned it up
" afterwards
. i also didn
' t like tjhe fatc that hartnett
' s character
, the man behind much of thge nastiness that goes down inspite this film
, was infallible
. inthe other words
, pretty much everything he says or asks ofthe someone
, happens automatically
and without any goofups
. i mean
, i know the guy is smart
and all
,
but i would ahve appreciated a little moreso
" realism
" under soem of the circumstances
.
but overall
, the movie will devastate you
. it
' s not a
" fun date movie
"
. it
' s not a movie about tghe high skool basketball team
and how its black star falls for the white girl from the other side of the tracks
. it
' s about jealousy
, love
, envy
, fury
, passion
, revenge adn pretty much any other negative
thought that
' s ever passed through your head
. is it worth seeing
? oh
, most definitely
!
( pun intended
) it
' s a moving picture with great performances
, no shakespearian speak
( thank you
, god
!
)
and an outst
anding directorial job by nelson
. the final scene alone isnt enough to send a massive chill down your spine
,
and i was especially impressed with the director
' s choise of music near tjhe end
. in fact
, the whole sequence was qtuie reminiscent of the final showdown scene ffrom taxi driver
,
and i guess that
' s saying something right there
. where
' s joblo coming from
