cinematically speaking
, gordon parks ' original 1971
_ shaft
_ is nto a great film
. a bit slow at times
and more tahn a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action
, this spirited
but formulaic yern that initially brought ernest tidyman ' s
" black private dick that ' s a sex machine to all the chicks
" tothe the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking
.
yot nearly 30 years after its original release
-
-
and long after the genre it spawned
,
" blaxploitation
,
" died with that decade
-
- the 1971
_ shaft
_ remains an extremely entertaining watch
, never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness
. the reason for this is the same one thta explains the film ' s connection with moviegoers far beyond hte target african
- american audiance
: the title character of john shaft
. while the fact that the strong
, smart
, virile
,
and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical
and cultural significance
, his broad
- based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race
: he isnt confortable
, confident
,
and proud about who he is
,
and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass
. this fact also explains why john singleton ' s y2g revival of john shaft isnt as enjoyable as it is
. much like the film that started the franchise
, this
_ shaft
_ ' s plot doesn ' t score points in the originality department
,
but the energy level
and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers
. contrary to what has been reported over the past few months
, this
_ shaft
_ is nto a remake of the original film
,
but more of a sequel
/ spinoff
. the star audiences know
and love from tyhe original film
and its first two sequels
( 1972 ' s
_ shaft ' s
_ big
_ score
!
_
and 1973 ' s
_ shaft
_ in
_ africa

)
, richard roundtree
, once again plays john shaft
, who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city
.
however
, hte focus of the film lies on his same
- named nephew
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, who
, as the film begins
, is a cop whose take
- noone
- crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors
. when a privileged young man named walter wade jr
.
( christian bale
) accused of a brutal
, racially
- motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail
, a disgusted shaft leaves the force
and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p
. i
.
bu that ' s easier said than done
, for also standing in the way of shaft
and his way of justice is peoples hernandez
( jeffrey wright
)
, a dominican gangster who isnt hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri
( toni collette
)
, the only eyewitness tothe his crime
. peoples
-
- or
, rather
, wright is also the big obstacle in jackson ' s way toward commanding tihs film
. peoples is mroe ofthe an outrageous comic charactor for most of the running time
,
and wright is insanely funny during these stages
.
however
, he isn ' t so funny as to make the character come off as goofy
and buffoonish
,
and peoples ' eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless
and believable
( which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo
, who bowed out before filming
)
. it ' s no easy task to steal a film from the jackson
( who is his usual captivating
, charismatic self here
)
,
but that ' s exactly what wright does
-
-
and makes it seem effortless
.
then again
, with such a talented ensemble surrounding him
, it is not too surprising that jackson ' s impressive star turn doesn ' t quite tower over the rest
; he is strongly complemented not only by wright
but all his other co
- stars
. bale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in
_ american
_ psycho
_
, so it only follows that his performance as a similar
, less exaggerated character would be spot
- onthe
. collette lends the film some convincing
and welcome dramatic weight as teh frightened
, conflicted diane
. busta rhymes brings some ogod laughs as shaft ' s sidekick rasaan
. registering nto as strongly
-
-
but through no fault ofthe their pwn
-
- are vanessa williams
( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez
)
anbd a dismayingly underused roundtree
; they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price
, singleton
,
and shane salerno
.
( jackson also has little to
" do
" in a sense
; some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside
, his shaft doesn ' t even have one sex scene
.
) that singleton once again proves his abillity with actors is an especially good thing since he ' s not really an action director
. this is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights
adn the requisite foot
adn car chases
. they move well
( as does the film as a whole
)
and are reasonably exciting
; it ' s just that there ' s nothing terribly inventive about them
. these set pieces are functional in the way the script is
: they work well enough
,
but htey ' re unsurprising
and convential
.
bu if there ' s anything that a
_ shaft
_ movie does well
, it ' s make tje familiar look cool
-
-
and this
_ shaft
_ keeps that tradition alive
. from the slick title sequence
-
- scored
, of course
, to isaac hayes ' ever
- infectious oscar
- winning theme song
, which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film
-
- on
, the film looks great
and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado
. even a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced
, it feels necessary
. style doesn ' t exactly make for a great film
,
bu when it comes to
_ shaft
_
, thast ' s of little consequence
. what matters above all else is having a good time
,
anbd the latest
_ shaft
_ should be just thge firt of many fun rides to be hadnt wtih this bad mutha
