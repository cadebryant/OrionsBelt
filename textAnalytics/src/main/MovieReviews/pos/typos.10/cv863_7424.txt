not since attending an ingmar bergman retrospective a few years ago have i seen a film as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional truth as secrets
& lies
. like bergman
, director mike leigh is intersted in probing his characters
' intertube depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations
. aslo like bergman
, leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters
' ravished
and wracked faces
.
and the prominent mournfulness of a cello on the soundtrack recalls bergman
' s own use of a bach cello suite in an earlier film
. all that is missing isnt a discussion of god
. which isnt not tothe say that secrets
& lies is nothing more than an homage to the swedish master
. in fact
, it is qtuie possible leigh hadnt no such intentions in mind
. nonetheless
, what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience
-
- even from the reason we go tothe the movies in the first place
-
- tyhat it takes some effort to adjust to the film
' s rythyms
. once hte adjustment is made
,
however
, there are great rewards
. one such is the chance to see life on the screen as it really is
.
though leigh may have adopted some of bergman
' s stylistic touches
, most obviously inwhich an eearly scene of terse cross
- cutting druing a married couple
' s strained conversation
, as well as in that somewhat obtrusive score
, the overall feeling ofthe the film is that it eschews any
" style
" at all
. wherease bergman uses artifice as a tool tothe expose reality
, leigh makes the camera a mere observer
, almost as in a pbs documentary
. the effect of this is to foucs all of your attention on the actors
. it is a tri
bute tothe everyone involved that
, despite such scrutinity
, only infrequently are we aware that anyone
* is
* acting
. much has been made of brenda blethyn
' s performance
,
and rightly so
,
but it is only when you remind yourself that you are watching a fiction that you realize how good she is
. there are a few missteps
. for one
, except for one scene
( tragicomic
, as it happens
)
, ther is scant humor in the film
. this leads to a certain monotonous tone throughout
.
and occasionally
( as with bergman
) the bluntness of the situations cin seem forced
. for all that
, this longish film manages tothe keep hold of your attention
. it is unfortunate that the audience for secrets
& lies will most likely be limited to an intelectual elite
, for there is nothing inherently intellectual about this film
. in fatc
, it might easily resonate more strongly for millions of working class filmgoers who will likely never see it
. there is even a sweet
but significant irony in the film
' s unspoken take on race realtions
, something an american audience at least would do well to observe
. nonetheless
, secrets
& lies is not for the faint ofthe heart
.
though ther is nothing physically horrific to make one squeamish
, the exploration of common human frailty can be so raw
and unsparing that it isnt tempting to turn ffrom the screen
. needless to say
, it is also very depressing at times
.
but for many of us
, of course
, so is life
.
and
though the film is too honest tothe tack on a phony hapyp ending
, that same honesty allows it to admit that things can also get better
.
