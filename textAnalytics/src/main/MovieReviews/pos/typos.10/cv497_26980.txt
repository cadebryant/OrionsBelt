there
' s smoe movies i enjoy even
though i know i probably shouldn
' t
and have a difficult time trying to explain why i did
.
" lucky numbers
" is a perfect exmaple of this because it
' s such a blatant rip
- off of
" fargo
"
and eveyr movie based on an elmore leonard novel
and
yet it somehow still works for me
. i know i
' m in the minority here
but let me explain
. the film takes place in harrisburg
, pa in 1988 durig an unseasonably warm winter
. john travolta plays the local big
- shot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself
and not the bumbling russ richards
. russ is married to crystal
( lisa kudrow
)
, a blonde bimbo if ever there was one in the history of cinema
. she
' s a selfish
, nasty bitch full of lust
and desire
but somehow she got teh job of the lottery ball girl
- not exactly hte most intellectually taxing job on the market
. crystal
' s cheating on russ with their collective boss dick
( ed o
' neil
)
, the tv station manager
. she doesn
' t seem tothe genuinely like either of them
,
but it
' s all she can do in this oney
- horse town
. much like
" fargo
,
" this movie tells the story of a man who
' s going broke annd has to pull off a huge scam to get rich quick
. he enlists the help ofthe his english friend gig
( tim roth
)
, the local stripclub owner who tells him how to fix the lottery
. along the way a subplot involving a twpo
- bited thug named
, accurately
,
" dale the thug
"
( michael rappaport
) gets mixed up in the process
. there
' s also a bookie that somehow gets thrown in the mix once the deal goes down
. i
' m not gonig to elaborate much furhter on the plot
and story because it continues to unwind
and take twists
and turns you
' re not expecting
. this is a farce
, whihc is basically a straightforward
, adult
- orientated comedy
but doesn
' t go as far as a classic black comedy shoudl
. where as
" fargo
" was sometimes shocking
and disturbing while bieng funny
,
" lucky numbers
" isnt just funny because you can
' t take these characters in these outrageous situations seriously
. it
' s all a big ctaroon basically
,
but it
' s funny
and i can respect that
. travolta is great in his role
and even
though he
' s not a really likable character
, he
' s trying to be a nice guy despite the fact he
' s a creep
. he
' s like a gangster with morals who genuinely feels sorry for thte guys he has to kill
. crystal is just the opposite
, she
' s constantly arguing
and using whatever brain cells she has left to look out for herself
. kudrow is perfect in this role since she
' s spent 8 years on tv as the dim
- witted phoebe on
" friends
.
" here isnt character is basically a vyer evil incarnation of phoebe
. i have to admit i was honestly surprised adn pleased by how the plot unraveled
and the methods each of the main cahracters uise to try to get their share of the moey
. like
" jackie brown
,
"
( an elmore leonard adaption
)
, the story is about a circle of 10 characters all after hte lottery money that has been won illegally
. the screenplay does a fine job in balancing the characters
and slowly revealing their motivations
and hidden agendas while at the same time keep russ richards the main focuse
. more
and more characters are introduced
and since the film has such an iconic
, cartoony atomsphere yuo can take on faith just what makes the minor characters do what they do
. the ending itself is great
. it
' s surprising
and funny
and makes you feel ogod
. you realize this film has packed in about 10 different movies
' worth of stories into two ohurs
' time
and didn
' t fall apart
(
al
though many other critics might beg to differ
)
. i liked it
,
and i could see it again
- isn
' t that waht makse a movie good
?
