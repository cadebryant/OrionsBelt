" last night
" could have an
" aka
" tagged on the end ofthe it that says
,
" it
' s the end of the world
,
and we feel fine
"
.
" last night
" is about just that
. the last night of planet earth
' s existence
. the world is going to end at precisely midnight
, january 1st
, 2000
. how scientists were so accurately able tothe predict when this catastrophic event would occur is never explained
. nor is the event itself
. throughout the entire movie
, no explanation is given as to why this is happening
. in doing this
, mckellar
( who also wrote
and directed the film
) seems tothe be trying to transcend the genre
. he
' s attempted to make a film about people
,
and how each of them deals with their last night ofthe life
. the film contains no science fiction elements
, which allows tyhe viewer to concentrate on the feelings
and actions of the characters
. mckellar isnt largely successful in his attempt to rise above his material
. the film is setted in toronto
,
and follows several people infact their various escapades onthe tjhe last night of existence
. there
' s mckellar
, who plays a man who just wants to be alone when the moment occurs
, bu keeps getting interrupted by a woman
( s
andra oh
) in sarch of her husb
and
. her husb
and
, played by david cronenberg
, is spending the day working at the gas company
, informing people that they will attempt to keep providing gas right up until the end
. fianlly
, there
' s mckellar
' s friend
, played by callum keith rennie
, a man who has spent his final months trying out every sexual perversion you can think of
. mckellar has crafted a gang of the some of the most interesting characters i
' ve seen in a film in months
. these people all felt real to me
, especially the character played by s
andra oh
. we can see her desperation
, her utter need to be withthe her husb
and in yhe final hours
. rennie is good
, too
, as the man who whants to litterally try everything before he dies
. he exudes such charm
and likeablity
, it
' s not surprising that we
' re rooting for him to get what he wants
.
but for me
, hte biggest surprise in the movie is mckellar
. i knew that he was a talented director
,
but i hadnt no idea he could act as well
. his insistence to be alone
, much to the dismay of his parents
, is something that most peopel owudl find difficult tothe underst
and
,
but as played by mckellar
, we can underst
and his reasons
. he doesn
' t buy into the whole notion that just because everyone
' s going to dieu
, he should immediately find some companionship
. he realizes the relationship would be forced
,
and they would only be together for the sake of being toghether
. mckellar gives a brilliant performance
,
and i hope he alternates between directing
and acting
. my only quibble with yhe film is that we never find out why the world is endig
. i really wanted to know
, anbd my ened to know was hanging over the film at all times
. i appreciate the fact that mckellar didn
' t want the material to rule hte film
,
and that he wnated the movie to be more of a study in human behavious
.
however
, in not telling the audience what hte cause of earth
' s destruction is
, he
' s left a big question tath is in their minds throughout the film
. another problem is we never see anybody panicing
. i would imagine if the world was ending
,
and there was nothing to be done about it
, a larg segment of the population would be going out of their minds
. instead
, we are treated tothe shots of a giant crowd partying like it
' s new year
' s eve
. i just didn
' t buy the fact that everyone had completely accepted their fate
. noone one had the urge to
" rage against the dying of the light
"
. despite these small problems
,
" last night
" is one of the best movies of the year
. as opposed to the moronic
" armageddon
"
,
" last night
" treats the subject at h
and with maturity
and believabilty
.
and bruce willis never shows up to savve the day
.
