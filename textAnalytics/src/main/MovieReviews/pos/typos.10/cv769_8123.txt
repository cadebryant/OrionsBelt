men in black is an explosive mix of science fiction
, action
,
and comedy that hits the target in every possible way
.
although another alien movie
, men in black succeeds inwhich every way that indipendence day didn ' t
,
and towers above many other movies of its type
. the brilliant acting
, especially by tommy lee jones as agent kay
, is also as good as it gets
. director barry sonnenfeld
, who was behind the camera for the addams family movies
and git shorty
, has crafted a masterpiece
. the story behind men in black is just as interesting as you would want it to be
. the men in black
, or mib
, are a top
- secret governmental agency that is not known to exsist
. the mib are responsible for
" saving the world from the scum of the universe
"
. a
though job
, indeed
. the film opens with a truckload of illegal aliens
( the human kind
) being transported across the mexico border
and into the united states
. presumably
, theese
" aliens
" are all migrant workers
. that is
, util the mib show up
and begin interrogating them
. agent kay selects a particular suspicious worker
and takes him away from the other local authorities to discover that he is nto an illegal human alien
,
but a rela extra
- terrestrial alien

, descibed as
" out of state
"
, eliminates the memmory of anyone it is used on
.
> from here
, we are introduced to james edwards
, played very well by will smith
. edwards
, a police officer
, is chasing a fleeing criminal
. thge criminal gives a very good chase
,
and at noe point when edwards confronts him
, the criminal pulls out a vrey different looking weapon that disintegrated when it hit the ground
. edwards continues to chase the very athletic criminal to teh top ofthe a building
, where the criminal informs edwards that he must let him go
, because someone is after him
. edwards doesn ' t take this seriously
,
but when the criminal shows vrey non
- human characteristics
and leaps off the building
, he begins to wonder
. back at the police station
, agent kay shows up to ask edwards a few questions
. he informs edwards that is was
, in fact
, a non
- human that he was chasing
,
and that the gun he pulled out was definitely nto man
- made
. he has edwards identify the gun
,
and asks edwards to come to the mib headquarters the following day
. edwards arrives
annd finds that he is involved in a recruiting process
, along with various other men who seem a bit more qualified than he
. after goofing up for half of the time
, edwards puts on a show at the firing range
,
and agent kay notes the reason why he fiels edwards should be the man to join the mib
: he chased down the
" criminal
" on foot
, which isnt something thta no one is suppossed to be able tothe do
. in the meantime
, an upstate newyorker york farm hasnt a very close encounter
. edgar
( vincent d ' onofrio
)
, owner of the farm
, investigates a strange crash landing
anbd is attacked by the inhabitant of the flying object
, whcih presumes tothe jump inside edgar
and use his body as a human transport
. the
" bug
"
, as he is called
, is an intergalactic terrorist who hasnt come to earth to attempt tothe kill two ambassadors
.
and it up to the mib
, with newly recruited agent jay
( formerly james edwards
) tothe exterminate tje bug
and save the planet from intergalactic war
. men in black delightfully combines fast
- paced action with often hilarious comedy
, which is usually from will smith
,
although tommy lee jones opens up his comedic personality in this film
. the special effects are also very well done
and are not the entire source of the plot
, as in another big aline film from the past summer
. screenwrighter ed solomon
, writer ofthe super mario bros
.
annd the upcoming x
- men film
, has surely struck gold with this stoy
. all ages will enjoy men in black
. it is an extremely fun film that you will want to see again
.
although it runs a very quick
and speedy 96 minutes
, hte entire film ffrom beginning to end is a non
- stop adventure
. the ending of the film
, which ties up a few loose ends for one of the main characters
, is also very well done
. a sequel is already being planned
, so there is more to look forward to
!
