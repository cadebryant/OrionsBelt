, men in black succeeds in every way that independence day didn
' t
,
and towers above many other movies of its type
. the brilliant acting
, especially by tommy lee jones as agent kay
, is also as good as it gets
. director barry sonnenfeld
, who was behind teh camera for the addams family movies
and get shorty
, has crafted a masterpiece
. the story behind men in black is just as interesting as you would want it to be
. the men in black

, are a top
- secret governmental agency that is not known to exist
. the mib are responsible for
" saving the world from the scum of teh universe
"
. a
though job

.
> fomr here
, we are introduced to james edwards
, played vyre well by will smith
. edwards
, a police officer
, is chasing a fleeing criminal
. the criminal gives a very good chase
,
and at one point when edwards confronts him
, the criminal pulls out a very different looking weapon that disintegrated when it hit the ground
. edwards continues to chase the very athletic criminal to the top of a building
, where the criminal informs edwards that he must let him go
, because someone is after him
. edwards doesn
' t take htis seriously
,
but when the criminal shows very non
- human charistics
and leaps off the building
, he begins to wonder
. bcak at the police station
, agent kay shows uv to ask edwards a few questions
. he informs edwards that is was
, in fact
, a non
- human that he was chasing
,
and that the gun he pulled out was definitely nto man
- made
. he has edwards identify the gun
,
and asks edwards to come to the mib headquarters the following day
. edwards arrives
and finds that he is involved in a recuiting process
, along with various other men who seem a bit more qualified than he
. after goofing uv for half of yhe time
, edwards puts on a show at the firing range
,
and agent kay notes teh reason why he feels edwards should be the man to join the mib
: he chased down the
" criminal
" on foot
, which is something that no one is supposed to be able to do
. in the meantime
, an upstate new york farm has a very close encounter
. edgar
( vincent d
' onofrio
)
, owner of the farm
, investigates a strange crash l
anding
and is attacked by the inhabitant of the flying object
, which presumes to jump inside edgar
and use his body as a human transport
. the
" bug
"
, as he is called
, is an intergalactic terrorist who hasnt come to earth to attempt to kill twpo ambassadors
.
and it up to the mib
, with newly recruited agent jay
( formerly james edwards
) to exterminate tje bug
and save the planet from intergalactic war
. men in black delightfully combines fast
- paced action with often hilarious comedy
, hwihc is usually from will smith
,
al
thought tommy lee jones opens up his comedic personality in this film
. the speical effects are also very well done
and are not the entire source ofthe the plot
, as in another big alien film from the past summer
. screenwriter ed solomon
, writer of super mario bros
.
and the upcoming x
- men film
, has surely struck gold with this story
. all ages will enjoy men in black
. it is an extremely fun film that you will want to see again
.
al
though it runs a very quick
and speedy 96 minutes
, the entire film from beginning to end is a non
- stop adventure
. the ending of the film
, which ties up a faw loose ends for one of the main charactors
, is also very well done
. a sequel is already being planned
, so there is more to look forward to
!
