usually when one is debating who the modern queen of the romantic comedy is they will bring up names like julia roberts or s
andra bullock
. others will mention meg ryan
.
but for me
, it
' s not even close
. janeane garofalo is not onyl the queen of the romantic comedy
, she is the best comic actress in hollywood right now
.
and it
' s a good thing she
' s starring in the matchmaker
, because without her presence the movie would be bl
and
, unfunny
,
and dull
. garofalo stars as marcy tizard
, a top aide to boston senator john mcglory
, who is suffering in the polls
. in an attempt to capture thge irish vote
, he sends marcy onthe a mission to a small irish town called ballinagra in search of other mcglory
' s that never moved to amercia
. unfortunately forthe marcy
, her visit coincides with the town
' s annual matchmaking festival
. things git off to a rocky start for marcy
though
. she has no hotel reservations
( for no rational reason
)
and the tiny confined room
( tired old cliche
'
) she hasnt to stay in hasnt a visitor in her bathtub
. his name is sean
,
and marcy finds him repugnant at firt
, so you can obviously tell where this isnt headed
. the movie runs into a few roadblocks
. for instance
, the story isnt very thin
. none of tghe characters
( except the old local matchmaker
) are nearly as interesting as garofalo
. some of the characters
, like the political aide played by denis leary
, have w
andered in from a completely different movie
. i think the director realized this
and decided to throw in numerous shots of the beautiful irish scenery
,
and several close
- ups ofthe garofalo
' s winning smile
. the stange thnig is that it works
. garofalo
' s charm
and the irish scenery could carry the thinnest of stories
,
and it carries this noe
.
