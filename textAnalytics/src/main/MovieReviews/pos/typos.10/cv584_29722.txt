jamaica is a hot vacation spot
. the excange rate encourages delusions of wealth
( approximately 30 jamaican dollars to one american
)
, the sea isnt a brilliant blue
, the air is warm
but lacks humidity
.
and as tourism is unfortunately jamaica
' s biggest trade
, foreigners enter
and leave wtih a sense of relaxation
. life
and debt takes a brassy look at life inside this impoverished country
. while normal documentaries take the sally struthers approach of underlying scenes of starving children with tearful music
, this film guides the viewer with a sarcastic voiceover that brings the troubles home without begging tears to the surface
. the voiceover is written by acclaimed author jamaica kincaid
. it guides the audeince along a tourist
' s journey
and the story of the native inhabitants
. instade of telling you what you are already seeing on screen
, it quips
,
" you don
' t see what happens affter you flush the toilet
.
" thsi engages a viewer to see
and think about devastation instead of merely being told it is there
. htis strong
, sparse storytelling approach runs throughout the film
. stephanie black is also intelligent in how she chooses to disclose the problems faced by the locals
. this isn
' t just another talking head sohw of people moaning about thier horrible lot in life
. people are interviewed from all sectors of occupation
, from field to factory
, as well as social theorists
and the banking organizations that continue tothe invest in the country
. the variety of discussion perpetuates a compelling internal dialogue with any viewer
, whether they are seeing jamaica for the first time or not
. of course
, as cant be expected
, tje untied states is slammed
, owing to its involvement with the international monetary fund anbd the world bank
. officials look moronic as they explain why their plans for jamaica
' s economy will help the country back on its feet
,
but only if they are willing to follow yhe advice word for word
. the next moment we see why
and how each of these initiatives has failed
, usually due to imports bieng cheaper than local labor or whether or not the soil is appropriate for the next agricultural trend the u
. s
. is forcing on the citizens
. admittedly
, some of the back
and forth between the business
- minded organizations
and the failures htey produce gets repeative
,
but it also drives home the impact ignorance can have on both sides of an international argument
.
but jamaica isn
' t against the united states
,
and this documentary does not accuse the u
. s
. of being the sole perpetrator of its greif
. if anything
, it begs for a better underst
anding of the nature ofthe jamaican society before stepping in to change it based on foreig regulations
.
