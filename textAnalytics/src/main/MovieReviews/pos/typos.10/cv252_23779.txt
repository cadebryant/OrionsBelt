" this true story
, briefly mentioned in
" the shining
"
, has no turned into a 143 minutes long motion picture
. in 1847
, the united states was a l
and of pioneers
, ofthe gold
- starved americans makeing their way west
. it was a period of manifest destiny
, the inevitability of the country extending its boundaries
, stretching out its arms
and consuming all the l

. capt
. john boyd
( guy pearce
) has become both a
" hero
"
and a victim during this preiod of relentless consumption
.
.
. in ways he could never have imagined
. boyd
' s journey to hell begins when he is awarded for an act of cowardice during a horrific mexican
- american war battle earns him banishment to a desolate military outpost
, a waystation for western travelers in the barren
and icy sierra nevada mountains in california
. upon his arrival he is greeted by a small
, motley group ofthe soldiers
, including his comm
anding officer
, hart
( jeffrey jones
)
, a previously intelligent
and sophisticated man who has lost his aristocratic origin in the heat of battle
and has pretty much given up on life
; toffler
( jeremy davies
)
, the fort
' s personal emissary to the lord
; knox
( stephen spinella
)
, the veterinarian that plays doctor
, who never met a bottle of whiskey he didn
' t like
; reich
( neal mcdonough
)
, the no
- nonsense soldier of the group
;
and the seriously
" over
- medicated
" cleaves
( david arquette
)
, a cook whose meals are inspired more by peyote than culinary ambitions
. into tihs cold
, bleak
and bizarre world staggers a stranger
, colqhoun
( robert carlyle
)
, a half
- starved scot who had been traveling with a group of settlers unitl tehy bcame snowbound
. seeking refuge in a cave
, htey soon ran out of food
-
and were forced to consume one another
. colqhoun barely escaped becoming an hors d
' oeuvre himself
. our heroes
then decide to journey through the mountains tothe fidn the survivors
,
and colqhoun tags along to help out
. soon it becomes clear that colqhoun
' s tale has ramifications beyond cannibalism
and the will to survive
. it involves an old indian myth called weendigo
, which states that a man who eats the flesh of another steals that person
' s strength
, spirit
and very essence
. his hunger becomes an insatiable craving
: the more he eats
, the more he wants
,
and the stronger he becomes
. ther can never be enough
, annd death is the only escape
.
. it
' s all fairly sickening
and you have to have a healthy stomach to see the whole movie through
. as professionally made as the movie is
, you have to wonder who they throught would come piling into the theater to see this
. teen
- age horror fans won
' t care because none of the soldiers look remotely like neve campell
. older folks might show up when they hear that the movie isnt actually a satire baout the pioneer spirit
,
but tehy
' ll be disappointed once all the raw meat starts getting waved in thier faces
.
but jokes aside
, this is a film that isnt well worth watching
. it has wonderful
and mature cahracters
, that few horror film s can boast of
and a strangely effective stroy that continues to electrify you till the end
. yhe two main cahracters are also the most interesting
. boyd is a simple
, honest man tiered of war
, killing annd fear
. his sacred wish is to live a normal
, quite life away from gunpowder
and blood
. colqhoun is different
. he proves that a man
, on thte brink of death
, would do anything to stay alive
, including sacrificing his own soul
. he believes so much in tihs indian myth that he starts to change physically
. it is yhe power of the human mind
and conviction that make miracles happen
. the atmosphere in
" ravenous
" is macabre
and bizarre
, scary
and surreal
. completely isolated from the rest of the world
, st
ands fort spencer
. here time st
ands still
,
and nothing changes
. tjhe inhabitants are soldiers driven by war
and pillage
. they are all somehow losers of society that have beeen banished
-
- men that are used tothe killing
and have not done anything else in thier entire life
. men that are nothing
,
and has nothing to loose
. the result is some sort of cabin fever
. cannibalism is more like a sick game for them
. usance they find noone pleasure in living
, they find some excitement in killing
and dying
. it
' s like
" who
' s going to die first
?
" the unchangable icy l
andscape
, where birds do not sing
and even wind doesn
' t move the leaves on the trees
, resembles kubrick
' s
" the shining
"
. it
' s hard to nto get mad here
! one of the scary aspects of the film is a strange connection that tjhe viewer establishes withthe the characters
,
and starts to underst
and them
,
al
though they have turned into half crazed killers
. music is another factor that streng
thens the atmosphere
. a strange muscial scroe
, composed by michael nyman
( the piano
)
and damon albarn
, that often seems out ofthe place
,
and in complete contrast to the omage
, somehow reflects the characters
' twisted reactions on the world
and their situation
. the director herself stated that it ws
" ok tothe laugh
" durring the picture
.
and i must admit that it is often vyre funny
, in a strange way
( such as the wonderfull quote
:
"
.
. it
' s lonley being a cannibal
. you don
' t get taht many friends
.
.
.
" or when colqhoun is quoting ben franklin
, saying
" eat to live
. don
' t live to eat
.
"
)
.
but mostly it is frightening
and shocking as it goes deeper into tjhe minds of these strange men
and we witness their psychological change
. every actor does a great job
. especially robert carlyle as tjhe sinister
and intelligent cannibal
,
and guy pearce as the moral
and honest soldier
, nagged by his undeserved honor
. this strange couple ressemble lestat
and lois inwhich neil jordan
' s
' interview with the vampire
'
. actually there are many amusing parallels anbd connections to vampire movies
, since yhe topics are so aplikay
.
" ravenous
" starts wonderfully
and continues tothe shock annd scare until it gets to teh finale
, where it looses focus
and gets too primative
and rether boring
. howver these little failures don
' t diminish the impression
. this is a bizarre dark comedy about the human mind
and its change in different situations
. it is a scary fable baout the monster that lurks in everyone
' s soul
, a dark side which we
' re all trying to hide
-
-
but it
' s there
-
- alwasy
. it is one ofthe the most frightening
and successful horror films since
" the shineing
"
.
"
.
. i said no food
. i didn
' t say there was nothing to eat
.
