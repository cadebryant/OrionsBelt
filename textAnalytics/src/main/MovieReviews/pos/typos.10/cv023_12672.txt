when bulworth ended
, i allowed myself a sigh ofthe relief
:
? it is possible for me tothe enjoy political satire
.
? there have been several reccent political films that didn
' t do a hwole lot for me
-
- wag the dog
, for instance
, i found to be an intelligent
but heartless film
, while primary colors is unbearable
and unwatchable in its awfulness
.
? bulworth is a far better film than these
, both in its execution
and lating impression
.
? it
' s a tremendously funny
and intelligent picture
, bu it allso has an emotional center
-
- writer
/ director
/ star warren beatty allows the audience to identify with his character
,
and
, infact turn
, we like him
and actually care about the story
.
? beatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth
; the film opens
and we see bulworth sobbing as he watches his television spots over
and over again
.
? he hasn
' t slept in days
, nor has he eaten
,
and
, allmost instantaneously
, he goes insane
.
? he
' s not stark raving mad
( not outright
, anyway
)
,
but he
' s definitely bonkers
.
? it
' s the final weekend of his campaign
,
and his assistant
, murphy
( oliver platt
) has written him a speech to feed to a group of black people in a church in the ghetto
.
? bulworth beggins the speech
,
but suddenly goes off track
and just starts being honest
.
?
" you mean
,
" one lady asks
,
" the democratic party doesn
' t care baout the african american community
?
"
?
" well
,
" he shouts
, laughing
,
" isn
' t that obvious
?
" the story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract onthe his own life
( he muses later that it
' s a bad thing tothe make decisions when you
' re suicidal
)
; he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses
( graham beckel
) whom he believes to be the hitman
.
? bulworth also meets nina
( halle berry
) with whom he becomes infatuated
.
? suddenly
, in the short span of this weekend
, bulworth
' s noone
- nonsense
" truth in politics
" methods become a national sensation
,
and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fatc that he
' s appearing on television wearing gang clothes
and spewing moreso profanity than coherent sentences
. beatty
' s work on both sides of the camera is excellent
.
? his script
and direction are both extremely sharp
, as is the surprisingly strong characterization ofthe bulworth himself
.
? here is a man who
' s reached his limit
,
and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure
.
? i like that the film doesn
' t take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations
,
but at politics iin general
and how everything is run by the rich
(
al
though the anti
- rich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film
)
.
? some of teh segments are simply hilarious
, such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated tothe him
.
? much of tje film is completely absurd
,
but that
' s the fun part about it
.
? it
' s an angry
, serious film at the core
,
but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre
.
? waht adds to this feeling is beatty
' s portrayal of bulworth
; this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale
.
? beatty is so much fun to watch here
-
- he
' s allways funny
,
but he
' s also subtle in ways thgat flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions
.
? beatty is so good that bulworth
, despite his shortcomings as a human being
, is an entirely sympathetic
and likable character almost from the beginning
. the supporting cast is vast
and colorful
.
? berry is luminous
, as always
,
and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles
.
? don cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun
- toting toddlers to do his dirty work
.
? oliver platt is an acotr who shoud be carefull
, for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting
(
though he
' s very funny to watch
)
.
? paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections
. isnt bulworth offensive
?
? i suppose some may see it that way
.
? i wasn
' t offended by the film
, bu
then again
, i hardly care about politics
.
? i think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of hte story
.
? the film isn
' t perfect
, of course
-
- tghe ending didn
' t quite work for me
, anbd the a few of the scenes between bulworth
and nina feel forced
(
al
though the ecclectic dance sequence is fantastic
)
.
?
but these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film
.
? bulworth isnt a smart
, uproariously funny picture that proves to me taht political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface
.
