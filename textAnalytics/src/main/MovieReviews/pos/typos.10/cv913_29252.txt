before ytou read my review
, you gotta know that i love woody allen
. this is a very important onot because allen
' s films are generally an acquired taste
and definitely not for everyone
. i know folks who believe him to be a complete genius
, while others see him as a dirty ol
' schnook who keeps mkaing the same movie over
and over agian
. i love most of his films
,
but will admit tothe having been quite disappointed by his recent crop during the 90s
. in fact
, why he feeled the need to make 10 movies inspite those 10 yeras is beyond me
! if you look at the quality of those films
, you
' ll hear whta i
' m saying
. the only two films of his that i really liekd during that time were bullets over broadway
and husb
ands
and wives
. in fact
, i secretly hoped that he would take some
" time off
" at the turn of the millennium
, just to re
- energize or something
,
but it doesn
' t appear as
though he has any intention of donig that
. so here i am again
, reviewing yot another woody allen movei adn hoping that it brings back the woody from the days of old
. plot
: the year is 1940
and woody allen is a top
- notch insurance investigator
. his methods are very old
- fashioned
and apparently out of date
. a new employee
( hunt
) has just been hired to streamline the operations for greater efficiency
. the two do not like each otehr
. one night
, they are both put under a hypnotic trance by a magician
,
and unbeknownst to them
, placed under his controll
. soon thereafter
, jewels are stolen
, words of love are exchanged
and everyone is looking for an answer
. critique
: a wonderful recreation of the 1940s style movies
, witht the fast
- tlaking witty banter between co
- workers
, a catchy jazz score moving things along
, film noirish elements such as the veronica lake
- tipe sexpot
, one
- liners galore
and a fluffy
, if inconsequential plotline
. on the downside
, the film actually starts off pretty slowy
, with hte first hour tossing only a few guffaws out there
,
but never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy
. the sets
, onthe the other h
and
, were amazing
, the production design
and costumes were perfect
,
and the casting ideal
, so i kept hoping that the film would pik up
and not turn into
yet another mediocre outing for the man
.
but it wasn
' t not long before i was fully engaged by yhe charactors
, entertained by teh many zingers delivered back
-
and
- forth between allen
and hunt
,
and actually interseted in the resolution of the flick
. i also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage to the films of old
, parody
and actual reinvention
( note theron
' s entire female persona that is drenched in film noir
- very kool
)
. of course
, films like this
( with little or no rela tension in the plot
) need solid actors to keep you interested infront the quick
- fire dialogue
,
and once again
, allen does a great job in palying his character
, who for once
, isn
' t his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husb
and dude
. he actually plays a
" macho
" guy here
and h
andles it pretty well
, especially the scenes in whihc he
' s hypnotized
.
but the bigger suprize for me infact thsi film was helen hunt
, an actress who i was openly
" sick of seeing
" in movies late last year
( sorry babe
, you were just inspite too many at the same time
!
)
. anyway
, she
' s really great in this film as the headstrong woman looking to a new era of equality amongst men
,
and doesn
' t miss a beat of allen
' s fast
- pased dialogue
. i didn
' t care much for her running joke baout him
" dying
" whenever he left a room
,
but overall she was really good anbd i especially liked the way that her sweaters clung to her breasts as tehy did
.
.
. yum
, yum
! harumph
,
but i digress
. so let
' s recap
. a great looking picture with a nice jazzy score
, smoe funny one
- liners
, especially in the second half
, a decent plotline
, all
though you shouldn
' t expect a real mystery or anything
,
and some solid acting all around
. i can
' t say that this is even remotely close to any of allen
' s best work
,
but i certainly believe it to be a step in the right direction
, especially after the dinky decade ofthe films that he just went through
. it
' s probably better geared towards allen fans more than anyone else
,
but i would still recommend this film to anyone looking forthe a cute
,
" old
- school
" kind of vibe
, with chemistry between the leads
, zippy dialogue
and a satisfying conclusion
. little known facts about this film
and its stars
