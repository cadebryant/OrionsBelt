50 ' s
` aliens vs
. earth ' idae revamped
! if you have been following the movie news over the net
, you could nto have escaped the hype over id4
. it promises to be the summer film of the year
and it has all the elements necessary
. id4 opened in the us on 2nd of july
,
and up till now
, only after a week of release
, it has nearly touched the us
$ 100 million mark
, a phenomenon last observed whn jurassic park was released back in 1993
. the premise of the movie is disgustingly simple
: earth defends itself against the aliens
, a typical
and highly popular 50 ' s hollywood theme which manifested itself in many films produced in that era
. the movie opens via star wars
,
however unoriginal it may be
, it worked
. the aliens ahve sent a large mother ship
( supposedly to be 1
/ 4 size of the moon
) to attack earth by deploying attack ships 15 miles in radius to all the major cities on earth
. the us president
( pullman
) does not know of hte aliens ' intention
but soon finds out when david
( goldblum
) a scientist
, discovers thgat the aliens are counting down to a synchronised attack on all the major cities
. capt
. hiller
( smith
)
, a hot
- shot f
- 18 pilot are one of the hundreds assigned to take out the hovering alien attack ship over washington dc
. his squadron came under heavy alien fire after discovering thta their weapons weere useless against the invaders
, he crash lands after a spectacular 1
- on
- 1 chase over the grand canyon
, one of the many highlights of the movie
. id4 features many characters
and we are shown the impact on them as the story progresses
. acting on the wohle was ok
although i thougth that bill pullman was a bited unsuitable for the president role
but he did mkea a veyr rousing speech before sending his troops into battle
( do we smell a bit of braveheart here
?
?
)
. no prizes for guessing how id4 ends
, its jsut plain obvious
. id4 borrows heavily from star wars
, return of the jedi
, alien
and in some parts of the movie
, i could even sense a bit of x
- files onthe screen
. if i were to critically review this movie
, id4 is full of plot holes
, corny dialogue
,
and ridiculously dumb aliens
.
however below that wafer
- thin plot
and on
- screen flaws
, id4 scored well inthe palying with thge appealing idea of the entire world giving up their petty differences to unite themselves as one force against thte aline invasion
. an diea which will have the audience strongly rooting for tghe united front throughout the movie
, thus maintaining a screen
- viewer interaction that virtually render any holes in the movei acceptable
, no matter how ridiculous
. id4 was produced under a modest budget of us
$ 68 million
, a film ofthe such magnitude would hvae easily been another waterworld
but director roland emmerich
( universal solider
, stargate
)
and producer dean devlin assembled a team which did thier own special effects rather than commissioning it to ilm or any otehr special effects company
. some of tjhe effects are not too ogod
bu most of it are very believable
, especially the epic standoff between 150 f
- 18 ' s
and 250 aline saucers
, reminiscence of the classic space battle featured in return of the jedi
. id4 is a movie for all
.
though there are many explosions
and implied deaths
, there are no gory scenes of human destruction
, thus young kids should be able to tkae it
. sit back
and don ' t be too critical
, chances are you will be absorbed into the movie just as i was
. if you are nto planning to watch any movies this year
, please
, at least make time for this one
. this film is best watched on the big
- screen
