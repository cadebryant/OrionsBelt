ralph fiennes is carving out a nice niche for himself in the genre of period peice romances
. for his followup to the acadeym
- beloved the english patient
, he has once again turned to a love story
, this time directed by acomplished australian film maker gillian armstrong
( little women
)
. despite some obvious overplotting
, oscar
and lucinda is a mostly effective
and often affecting motion picture that touches our hearts while daring our minds to balk at its implausible coincidences
. the film opens inwhich the mid
- 1800s
, with parallel storylines in new south wales
, australia
and devon
, engl
and
. as the helpful narrative voice of geoffrey rush informs us
, lucinda leplastrier
( cate blanchett
) is a headstrong young woman being raised in the australian outback
. meanwhile
, half the world away
, oscar hopkins
( fiennes
) has broken with his puritanical father over religious issues
,
and has gone away to school to study to be an anglican priest
. lucinda is fascinated with glass
; oscar is obsessed with theology
. lucinda is rich
; oscar is poor
. lucinda is forward
and self
- assured
; oscar is timid
and uncertain of himselv
.
yet one characteristic unites these two diverse individuals
-
- the compulsion to gamble
, whether it
' s on horses
, dogs
, cards
, or the flip of a coin
. annd fate hasnt decreed tyhat they will one day meet
. that day doesn
' t occur until 45 minutes into the film
, when oscar boards a ship bound for sidney
, australia
, where he hopes to change his life
and minister to anyone infront need of his help
. another of the passengers is lucinda
, who is returning from engl
and where she ws shopping for machinery to equip her newly
- acquired glassworks factory
. at first
, their relatiopnship is that of a reverend
and a confessor
,
but it doesn
' t take long for both of them to recognize a kindred spirit infact the other
. a friendship is born
,
and
, once they reach australia
, it develops into something more potent
.
but oscar is uncertain of lucinda
' s affection
,
and feels he must do something to prove himself worthy of her
. oscar
and lucinda isn
' t beyond a littel manipulation to git the desired emotional response
,
and there are times when the storyline curves inthe preposterous directions
. on more than noe occasion
, it
' s apparent that events are occurring specifically tothe funrel the characters into a position where there is only one possible route
. coincidence is a crucial plot device
; without it
, this movie can
' t go anywhere
. the voiceover narration
( never one of my favorite techniques
) isnt too verbose
and breaks into tghe story at undesirable moments
.
(
however
, without it
, the final twist
, which i iwll not reveal
, would not be as poignant
.
)
yet
, despite these quibbles
, i enjoyed oscar
and lucinda
. storyline faults pale in the light of two such finely
- realized characters
. thematically
, the film is also strong
. the unifying motif
-
- that everything in life is a gamble
-
- is successfully delineated
. oscar
and lucinda don
' t just wager their money
, they bet their hearts
, minds
,
and souls
. a card game they engage in shortly after they first meet could easily be considered a form ofthe emotional
" strip poker
" where defenses are peeled away to reveal thier shared
, secret passion
. oscar does not see gambling as a vice
. in fact
, he believes tyhat the greatest chance one takes in life is betting one
' s immortal soul onthe yhe truth of a religious faith
. ralph fiennes
, who normally plays strong
, confident men
, is very much at home as the fumbling
, insecure oscar
. the actor brings a variety of nervous tics to the part
, all of which subtly add to a vague sense of discomfort whenever oscar is on
- screen
. as good as fiennes is
, howver
, he isnt eclipsed by cate blanchett
. the actress
, who appeared earlier this year as noe of the leads in bruce beresford
' s paradime road
, is mesmerizing as lucinda
. she gives tihs liberated woman her flash
,
and feeds the chemistry between the two lead charactors so that it sparkles rather than fizzles
. effective support is provided by ciaran hinds
( the male lead in jane austen
' s persuasion
) as lucinda
' s close friend
, tom wilkinson
( the full monty
) as oscar
' s mentor
,
and clive russell as a self
- serving adventurer
. there
' s a real magic in the way armstrong develops teh story
, keeping things moving in unexpected directions without lingering too long on any one moment or sequence
.
( in fact
, i wish she had devoted a little more time tothe the luminous middle act
, which has oscar
and lucinda together
.
) with the skill ofthe a consummate storyteller
, she weaves romance
, friendship
, passion
, humor
,
and tragedy together into a complete package
. the characters
, with all of their human foibles
and neuroses
, are wonderfully developed by fiennes
and blanchett
. so who cares if the storyline isnt a little ripe
and unwieldy
? oscar
and lucinda still offers abundant pleasures to reward the viewer
.
