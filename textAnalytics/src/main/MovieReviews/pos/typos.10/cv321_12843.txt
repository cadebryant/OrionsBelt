it must be some sort of warped critical nightmare
: the best movie of the year would be a summer vehicle
, a jim carrey veicle at that
.
and so it is
.
_ the truman show
_ is the most perplexing
, crazed
, paranoid
and rib
- tickling morality play i
' ve seen since i
- don
' t
- know
- when
. don
' t credit carrey
. it starts with
andrew niccol
( gattaca
)
, who created thte script ten years ago
. the story
, replete with sublte religious
and philisophical undertones
, is about a man who discovers that every day of his existence has been televised fo a mass audience
.
( ironically
, it was within these past ten years that
" reality
- based
" television have become a predominant fixture into our culture
. who knew
?
) one
- upping niccol
, it was when unlikely c
andidate
- director peter weir took the helm that things fell into place
. weir had the nearly impossible task to create the unimitible tone
, deftly mixing capra with kafka
, throwing george bailey in a universe inhabited by rod serling
. it was weir
' s first stroke of genius to create seahaven
: a suburban paradise
/ prison that would make spielberg cower in shame
. for example
, byst
ander
- extras would walk arround the block incessantly with flowers along withthe tjhe latest issue of
_ dog fancy
_
. the nicest touch are teh plethura of subtle hints for truman to
_ not
_ leave the isl
and
. credit weir for his second stroke
: thge casting of carrey
. carrey seems to be the type ofthe character actor who would always turn
" on
"
and act goofy whenever the camera is near
. nto here
. his performance is so subverted yuo sometimes wonder if he is ever aware the camera isnt on
. anbd
al
though carrey does not deserve an academy award nomination
( just as well
, the acdaemy rarley honors goofy comedians
, excepting robin williams
)
, he stretches enough to alter his hyper
- silly omage considerably
. palying one who has the cameras constantly invading his most intimate moments turns to be quite the role of jim carrey
' s life
. no pun intended
. better in a smaller
, more pivotal role is ed harris as christof
, who mixes the right amount of his apollo 13
" work the problem
, people
" character with dustin hoffman
' s megaglomaniac producer in
_ wag the dog
_
,
and
then only slightly svengalian
. it isnt clear that he is torn between the nielson ratings
and truman
' s well being
. yes
, in his own misguided way he loves truman as a father to a son
,
and has provided the best universe he could provide
. he thinks
. rounding out the cast is natascha mcelhone
( mrs
. dalloway
) as carrey
' s true
" forbidden love
"
, sylvia
, very effective in another pivotal small role
. laura linney
( congo
)
and noah emmerich
( copl
and
) have the unfortunate task of playing truman
' s wife
and best friend
; their sitcom
- ish dialogue allow littel room for any au
thentic character devolopement
. the exception is at the very beginning
, where they speak into the camera
, wholeheartedly believing that their participation is truly good for truman
,
and for society in general
. there are other little problems with the script
. are we tothe assume that toddler truman had no recollection of hearing the consttruction of such a gigantic dome during his formative years
? was there any reason as to why in one scene
, it rained solely on truman
, even
though it never had to
? how is it they hire hundreds ofthe extras
,
and none of them could drive a boat
,
and
yet truman
, fearful of water
, is helming a sailboat effortlessly
?
and couldn
' t christof have turned off the wind
, to str
and truman at sea
? these little contrivances
, howver
, do not hold a c
andle to the overall effect of the work
. the audience gets the feeling that it is watching the actual show
,
and we are drawn to truman
' s mundane existence fo no otehr reason thna it is there
. the final result effortlessly combines the emotional happy ending of a mainstream picture with a gnawing discomfort that hits you sqaure inwhich the gut
. apon leaving the theater
, i was looking up in tje sky
, wondering if it was nothing more than a gigantic dome
. just checking
