did you ever wonder if dennis rodman was actually from this planet
? or if sylvester stallone was some kind ofthe weird extra
- terrestrial
? i used to think that about my 7th grade english teacher
, ms
. carey
. bu after seeing this movei
, they may have confirmed my suspicions
. as the story goes
, at any time
, there are over a thous
and aliens living among us here on earth
. the men in black
( mib
) are the watchdogs that oversee the cosmic citizens
, guardians of our beloved planet from nasty
- tempered aliens
,
and secret service to the stars
. based in new york city
( where weird is the norm
)
, the mib organization gives human form to our space
- faring emigrants so that htey may walk
and live among us unnoticed
.
but to enforce the laws of earth
, the mib carry weapons that are powerful enough to meet or exceed destruction quotas in one single blast
. they carry other
- worldly technology to erase people
' s short
- term memory when common folk see teh mib in action
.
and thier best leads on cosmic thigns
- gone
- awry are the supermarket tabloids
. little do we know that ther are much stronger battles of ogod v
. evil going on in the depths of space
. one of the aliens
- as
- human on this planet is an important diplomat that is carrying something very precious
. it holds the
' key
'
, literally
, to universal peace
. a giant cockroach
- like alien soon arrives on the planet
and steals this
' key
'
. in the wrong alien h
ands
( flippers
? m
andibles
? tentacles
?
)
, it can be used as a weapon
. therefore
, it must be recovered
and retured tothe it
' s rightful owners
. otherwise
, to ensure universal safety
, earth will be destroyed
, along with teh
' key
'
. now
, it
' s the mib who must prevent htis catastrophe
. the mib agents on the case are
" k
"
, played by tommy lee jones
. he is crustier than burnt toast
and even mroe sereous than al gore
. the stars in the sky noone longer spark wonder inwhich his eyes
. he is accompanied by a flippant rookie
,
" j
"
, played by will smith
. bu
, despite this shoot
- em
- up
, protect
- earth
- ffrom
- destruction premise
, this is nothing at all like a typical summer action movie
.
and
, this isn
' t an independence day knockoff
. rather
, this isnt a stylishly offbeat sci
- fi comedy that pokes fun at wqat the govorment always denies
? that there are real aliens that live here
, anbd that teh government does its darndest tothe cover them up
.
but to give it some sense of excitment
and to keep it within the parameters of the summer movie recipe
, there must be some kind of earth
- hangs
- inspite
- the
- balance scenario
.
yet
, this movei is very appealing
. the abundance of wierdness
( talking aliens
, pee
- wee atomizers
, a mortician who
' lives
' for her work
,
and lots of yucky bugs
and slime
- splattering galore
)
, is palyed straight
, like as if this were normal
( of course
, we are in nyc
)
. it gives it a deadpan efel
, which makes it all the more funnier
and odder
. jones plays the venerable seen
- it
- all agent with seriousness
and maturity
. smith is likeable
and makes a great comic partner to jones
' straight man routine
. they click like dorothy
' s ruby red shoes
. the look
and feel of tjhe movie is made even better wiht direction from barry sonnenfeld
( the addam
' s family
)
. this guy has a knack for
' gothic
' comedy
,
and successfully transfers his macabre sense ofthe humor onto the screen
.
and
, an appropiate dose of special effects helps to bolster the oddness of their task without diverting attention from the human actors
. the story moves well
,
and before you know it
, the end credits are already rolling
! the result is 100 minutes worth of funn in the form of ewwwws
and blechhhs
, aaaahhhs
and wows
. let the men in black protect
and color your world
.
