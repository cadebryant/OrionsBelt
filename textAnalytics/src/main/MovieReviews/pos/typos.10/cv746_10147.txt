( dimension films
,
" scream 2
"
' s distri
butor
, has asked press to say extremely little
-
- if anything
-
- about teh film
' s twisty plot
. that
' s no easy task considering the wit that deserves to be maintioned here
,
but i will dont my best tothe be vague
( now
, there
' s a first
)
.
)
" tghe first noe ws
[ good
]
, bu all thge rest sucked
,
" said a cinematically
- savvy teen in last winter
' s wes craven thriller
" scream
,
" her statement referring to the films of tjhe
" nightmare on elm street
" series
but really putting down franchise overkill in genaral
. the comment certainly carries clout
: for every truly great sequel
, there appears tothe be a couple of duds
, making one wonder if writers are better off sticking solely with fresh idaes
.
but like it or not
, along comes
" scream 2
.
" annd believ it or not
, it
' s a doozy
-
- a slick
, sinister
, madly subversive good time at the movies
, as intent on sending up hollywood
' s sequel syndrome as much as its prequel poked fun at slasher conventions
.
" scream 2
" is definitely that rare movie thing
-
- a follow
- up that can st
and along side its origional with prade
. it
' s been two years since a pair of overzealous horror movie fans clad in edvard munch
- esque git
- ups carved their way through the young populace of woodsboro
, california
. those surviving tghe ordeal have gotten on with their lives
. plucky heroine sidney prescott
( neve campbell
) is a drama student at the midwestern windsor college
; her pop culture
- whiz pal r
andy meeks
( jamie kennedy
) has tagged along
. trash tabloid reporter gale weathers
( courteney cox
) has written a best
- seller based onthe their ordeal
, the basis of whic has been turned into a
( very bad
) movie called
" stab
.
"
and dewey riley
( david arquette
)
, still suffering ffrom wounds inflicted during
" scream
,
" has left his job as a police officer forthe a while
. life is tranquil
.
.
. at least for a while
. several sudden murders bring sidney
, r
andy
, gale anbd dewey together again
,
but with suspicious eyes casted on each other
and most of those in their suroundings
-
- if these four people learned anytying from the past
, it
' s to trust no one
. thus
, the possibile victim
/ potential killer list includes said quartet
, as well as
: derek
( jerry o
' connell
)
, sidney
' s new beau
; cici
( sara michelle gellar
)
, a chatty sorority gal
; joel
( duane martin
)
, gale
' s cameraman who
' s nto too thrilled with her blood
- soaked past
; hallie
( elise neal
)
, sidney
' s sassy roommate
; debbie
( laurie metcalf
)
, a local reporter who gives gale some not
- too
- friendly competition
;
and mickey
( timothy olyphant
)
, r
andy
' s good friend
and fellow film student
. cotton weary
( liev schreiber
)
, the man sidney wrongly accused of her mother
' s murder in scream
, also shows up on cumpus
-
-
but why
? like the first scream
, craven
and screenwriter kevin williamson inaugurate thnigs with a bang
. this time
, it
' s an extended sequence thta finds an african
- american couple
( jada pinkett
and omar epps
) attending a sneak preview of
" stab
,
" mkaing sly references about everything fomr s
andra bullock to the lunchmeat non
- roles of blacks in slasher cinema
. before tragedy ensues at the screening
, the movie
- within
- a
- movie setup allows for plenty of jokey moments
, including a scene ffrom
" stab
" which turns scream
' s now
- famous drew barrymore prologue on its ear
.
(
" b
-
-
-
-
, hang up the phone
and star
- 69 his a
-
-
!
" pinkett yells at the screen
.
) it
' s funny
, creepy stuff
( i don
' t think i
' ll ever feel safe in a movie theater again
) that effectively foreshadows thte ratio of smart scares
and spoofy laughs down the road
. another flawless example of thsi isnt a riotous cell phone
- assault of the killer on r
andy
, dewey
and agle in broad daylight
; it builds comedically
and ends with genuine terror because of thte emotional investment made on these delicious characters
. there are other superb setted pieces
, bu explaining them risks ruining their effect
. there are more players this time around as to provide both a higher number suspects
and a staggering body count
. it
' s something of a trade
- infront
-
- the new characters are too large in number to be as fully
- developed as the original
" scream
" gang
,
but this movie packs inthe knowing performances
( especially by kennedy
and cox
)
and more death for your dollar
. it can be argued that
, while the original might outclass it by a tad
, scream 2 is both scarier
and funnier
. it certainly doesn
' t skimp with shocks
-
- a major one being the killing of one cast memeber very near
and dear to my heart
( i actually questioned craven
and williamson
' s judgment here
, considering how much this person has added to these films
)
. sometimes you wish that more could have been done with stab
-
- the twpo scenes we
' re shown are dead
- on
-
-
but for film fans
, there are plenty of subtle nods to movies liuke
" the usual suspects
,
"
" aliens
"
and
" thge empire strikes back
.
" still
,
" scream 2
" does so many things right
, it
' s petty to quibble
. its penchant for parody is irresistible
, discussions of the merits of film sequels
and all
. the attractive
, solid cast is a definite bonus
.
and the denouement
( hwile not as shocking as
" scream
"
' s
) is priceless
; the film
' s final revelation incorporates bits of a particular horror film prominently referred to in
" scream
" with oen of the best bad guy motives ever put on paper
. all this
and a
" scream 3
" is in the works
. knowing the series
' tendency forthe self
- reference
, perhaps one ofthe its cahracters will again discuss the concept of sequel justice
. mentioning
" scream 2
"
' ll help them in their argumetn
.
