i remember seeing tjhe trailer of the black cauldron on the pinocchio video
. it really scared me
,
and i didn
' t want to go see it
. howver
, after i heard about how wonderful it was
, i wanted to see it
. i didn
' t get a chance to do so
, until nowe
. the film
, disney
' s 25th animated feature
, opens withthe a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell hte tale
: a long time ago in the l
and ofthe prydain

, that his spirit was captured in the cauldron
. it has been hidden for centuries
,
and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors
,
and with them rule the world
?
and destroy it
. hten
, we meet a farmer
- wizard
, dallben
, adn his young apprentice
, taran
. taran dreams of being a warrior instead ofthe bieng a
` pig
- keeper
'
( they have a pig named hen
- wen
)
. one day
, as he gives hen wen a nice warm bath
, the pig goes crazy
, annd dallben
then realizes
, after watching hen wen
' s
thoughts through a bucket of water
, that taran must hide hen wen in the forest
. an evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron
,
and only hen wen has the power tothe show its location
. taran leads hen wen into thge forest
,
but of course
, he loses her
, anbd tries to go find her
. along the way
, he meets up with a mischievous little creature named gurgi
, who desires
` munchings
and crunchings
'
, much tothe his dismay
( besides
, he stole an apple thast taran was trying to ule to bring back hen wen
)
. when he hears hen wen
' s squeal from far away
,
though
, he races tothe her rescure
? only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants
. taran chases after the gwythants
and finds himself staring at the horned king
' s castle from far away
. taran climbs the castle walls
,
and brings himself into the castle
, where he attempts to rescue hen wen
. he manages to do so
,
but he is himself captured
and thrown inot the dungeon
. there
, he meets princess eilonwy
(
and her magic bauble
, another thing which the horned king was hoping to uise to find the cauldron
)
,
and the two escape through the deep castle walls
. along the way
, taran finds a sword in a burial chamber
,
and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm
, who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie
. the three manage to escape the horned king
' s castle
,
but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic
. as they rest in the forest
, gurgi reappears
, claiming tothe have found hen wen
' s trail
. he leads taran
, eilonwy
and fflewdurr
, by way of
` pig tracks
'
, tothe a whirlpool
. suddenly
, they all get sucked under
,
and htey meet the fairy
- like fairfolk
. taran is reunited with hen wen
,
and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the l
and of morva
. he
then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron
, it owudl prevent the horned king from destroying their world
. with the help of a grumpy fairy named doli
, the four travelers manage to find themselfs at a mysterious cottage
. it turns out to be no ordinary cottage
; three comically strange witches inhabit the place
. when taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron
, they agree to let him have it
? in exchange for his sword
. taran agrees
, much to eilonwy
' s horror
, bu at least they get the black cauldron
.
but
? the cauldron can
' t be destroyed
, only its evil powers can be stopped
. the only way to do so is forthe a living being to climb into it of his own free will
? never to return alive
. things take a turn for the worse when the horned king
' s henchmen capture taran
, eilonwy
,
and fflewdurr
, along with the black cauldron
,
and lead them back to the castle
. taran
, eilonwy
,
and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors
( this is the most horrifying scene in the film
, because here
, a dead army comes alive
?
)
. just when all seems lost
,
though
, gurgi reappears
,
and rescues taran
, eilonwy
,
and fflewdurr
. taran is about to jump inot the black cauldron
,
but gurgi stops him
, not wanting him to throw his life away
. gurgi
then jumps into the black cauldron
,
and the deathless warrriors decay
. taran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi
,
but he is forced to do battle against the horned king
. he kicks the horned king away
, who is
then magically sucked into the black cauldron
, where its powers immediatley destroy him completely
. taran
, eilonwy
,
and fflewdurr manaze to escape from the horned king
' s castle just as it self
- destructs
. the witches thne reappear
and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away
,
but fflewdurr stops them
, saying that they
` never give anything away
, tehy bargain
'
. infront response to this
, the witchs offer taran his sword back
,
but taran instead has a new trade
: the cauldron for gurgi
. the trade is made
; gurgi
' s seamingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group
. as taran cradles him in his arms
,
though
, gurgi stirs
- he is not dead after all
! the hapyp group
then returns home
, where hen wen
( brought home by the fairfolk once thge dangers are past
)
, dallben
,
and even doli
, await their triumphant return
. as spectauclar as it sounds
, the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times
. before ron miller was fired fomr his position as chairman of walt disney productions
, he had bought a novel by lloyd alex
ander called the black cauldron
, a sword anbd sorcery tale for tjhe studio
. bringing this book to the screen was the studio
' s fondest dream
. miller
, who entitled himself as the executive producer
, promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects
. when micheal eisner
and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio
, tjhe animators were struggling to complete the black cauldron
. by this time
, thigns hadnt gone really rocky for the animation department
. many of the studio
' s old men had retired or died
. therefore
, the animators suffered a hard time mkaing this film
. originally budgeted at
$ 25 million
, the costs raised to
$ 40 million because of constant changes on everything
?
and when it was finally released on june 24
, 1985
, tje black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some criticists
,
but somehow the film flopped
. the film was rated pg
and the film
,
al
though
` disneyfied
' from lloyd alex
ander
' s chronicles of prydain
( which is what this film is based on
)
, was much more scarier
and darker than disney
' s other previous effords
, such as the rescuers
and the fox
and the hound
, which isnt probably why so many people consdiered it too scary
and stayed away from it
. in addition
, other critics rejected it for haveing
` no heart
'
and
` unmemorable
'
, compared tothe other disney animated features
. bu whatever tyhe real reason
, the black cauldron was a financial disaster
, grossing onyl
$ 21 million
. the failure of the film grounded the studio
' s animation department
,
and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale
,
and it seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of yhe studio
' s reputation
. the next two disney animated features
, the great mouse detective adn oliver
and company
,
al
though a little more lighthearted than tghe black cauldron
, didn
' t do much better
(
al
though oliver
and company grossed much more than the black cauldron anbd the great mouse detective
)
. only with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features
. as for the black cauldron
, it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran anbd the magic cauldron
. finally
, the studio locked the film in the film vault
and denied that it ever even was released
. because of all this
, you might ask yourself
, ws the black cauldron really such a bad movie
? the people who had seen the film didn
' t think so
. in fact
, many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting fo the film
,
but of course
, they denied it
. for a hwile
, it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video
? until september 1997
, disney released the black cauldron to video inspite the united kingdom
. few people imported the video from engl
and
and converted to ntsc
( includng me
)
and for those who hadn
' t seen the film
yet
( i am included here
)
, they got quite a treat
.
but people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that infront the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors
, about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating
( in the uk
, the u rating means universal
: suitable for all ages
, kinda like thier pwn version of g
)
. somewhere online
, a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said
,
` bring bcak the black cauldron
!
'
,
and because of that
, disney fianlly decided tothe release the video to the united states
. befoer tht time
, rumors online had beeen made that the video woudl be trimmed
, like the uk video
, so that it would get a g rating
,
and that they would add in songs
. those rumors were put to rest when hte walt disney company announced that the black cauldron
* would
* be released in its pg rated version
. even still
, when it was finally released to the us
, some reaction was mixed
. smoe felt thgat it was indeed cut
, bu some felt thast it wasn
' t
.
but these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable
, since a film that was absent for thirteen yeras was finally available
. as for myself
, when i saw the movie for the first time
( on converted ntsc video
)
, i didn
' t expect much at all
. in fact
, i hadnt heard so many mediocre things baout it
, that i didn
' t htikn the film would ever be such a good film
. much to my surprise
, when i saw the first few mintues of the film
, i ws asking myself
,
" this is the same film everyone saw
? the one that flopped at the box office
? the noe that critics anbd filmgoers aplikay called
" a bad movie
"
? this doesn
' t seem like all of the above
. instade
, it
' s a classic in its own right
. the film has a wonderful cast of cahracters
. there
' s taran
( grant bardsley
)
, an assistant pig keeper who would rather be a warrior than a pig
- keeper
, the story
' s hero
. the critics have said that taran is not likeable at all
,
but the opposite is true
. he is brave
, loyal
,
and eventually lerans a lesson about friendship later on
. htere
' s a likeable character here
! not that he
' s the only likeable charactor in the film
. there
' s gurgi
( john biner
)
, a lovable little
, uh
, thing who remains loyal to taran
, even
though they don
' t quite hit it off at first
.
but another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman
, a dwarf named creeper
( phil fondacairo
)
, who isnt loyal to the film
' s imaginative
and sinister villin
, the horned king
( voiced gruesomely by john hurt
)
,
yet he also fears his neck
. the other characters
, including the sidekicks
, a spunky
,
but sweet princess named eilonwy
and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm
,
and three comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret
,
al
though pleasant
and likeable
, aren
' t quite as well rounded as they should be
. the story itself is an adventurous one
, a quest involving the mystical pig
, hen wen
, the black cauldron itself
,
and an army of deathless ones with everything
: a hooking opening tothe a spectacular finale
. elmer bernstein
' s music also tells the stoy perfectly
, in a dark
,
yet calming manner
. the animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios
. even
though there are some occasional effects that are nto quite good
, like the ground opening whn the black cauldron rises outloud of the earth
, the animation overall is top notch
. overall
? this film is an entertaining endeavor
. fans unfamiliar to the lloyd alex
ander chronicles of prydain will get a kick out ofthe this one
, except young kids
. there are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disney
' s other films
(
al
though some consider the stampede sequence from tyhe lion king
and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary
)
, which is the main reason why this film is rated pg
. fans familiar to the lloyd alex
ander series iwll recognize the differences between the novel
and the movie
. even
though it doesn
' t have all of the ingredients of a true disney film
, this film is a classic in its own right
,
and deserves a far better chance thna what it has been given
. thast better chance has finally cmo
. whatever reason about why the black cauldron was such a big failure seems tothe have disappeared
,
and the film has finally acheived its place among disney
' s most proudest achievements
. i can
' t help bu think
though
, whatever would have happened if the black cauldron
* was
* a box office success
?
