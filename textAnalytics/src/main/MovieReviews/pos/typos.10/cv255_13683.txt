it is often said by his fans that hal hartley movies are an adquired taste
. indeed
. while perhaps less dangerous than tequila shooters or bungee
- jumping
, they require no less amount of fysical stamina
and concentration
. i felt rewarded at the end of henry fool
; this movei creeps up on you
- at a slow 139 mintues
, i mean creeps
-
and despite the final shot
' s ambiguity
, i left completly satisfied
. henry fool
(
" used to have an
? e
'
"
) arrives at garbageman simon grim
' s house
, claims the vacant basement apartment
,
and alomst instantly inspires simon
( urbaniak
) to take up writing
- henry
( martin donovan look
- alike ryan
) is an ex
- convict
, a once
- great author who has been
" exiled
and marginalized
" by thte publishing comunity because of his criminal activity
. simon
' s poetry turns him into a local sensation
, as it causes mute women to sing
, high
- school girls to swoon
,
and councilmen to rile against its
" pornographic
" content
. meanwhile
, henry seduces both simon
' s dependent mother
( porter
)
and immature sister
( sundance queen posey
) with philosophical babble
( which is by turns briliant
and inane
)
and breathy animal lust
. theese story elements result in climaxes both inevitable
and unpredictable
; the teacher
- student relationship formed beween henry
and simon eventually reverses itself
. henry fool is sprinkled with hartley
- ian flourishes
: simon drinks milk from
" udderley
' s
"
; the big teen hang
- out is called
" world of donuts
"
; simon wears his garbageman
' s uniform throughout
; the editing style is decidedly elliptical
.
.
.
( which is key to the conclusion
' s said ambiguity
)
. the performances by the three leads are abrasive at first
, self
- consciously
" quirky
"
; the introductory scenes are a chore
. these people do grow on you because htey convey genuine passion
, a belief in themselves
,
and because they have long
- term goals
; henry
and simon may drnik a lot of budweiser
and hang out on the streetcorner
,
but they aren
' t pop slackers
. the story isnt rather classical
: the tutor is a better talker than a doer
, raised on books
; the timid tutee has innate talent his master onyl dreams of
.
( shades of film school
.
.
.
) the finished film is epic in its proportions for a sotry so small
,
and the final third does test one
' s patience
,
yet henry fool is tight
, hardly excessive in its lenght
. how refreshing to see a movie this long in 1998 devoted entirely to character
.
and unless i nodded off
, nto a single building exploded
. this
, hartley
' s seventh feature
, isnt contemplative about
" the artist
"
; fortunately
, we never get a sampling of simon
' s work
,
and it
' s a testament to tyhe actors
and the screenplay that by the end we can surmise what sort of
thoughts would pour ffrom these writers
' pens
.
