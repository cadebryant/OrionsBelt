" remember what tyhe mpaa says
: horrific
and deplorable violence is ok as long as you don ' t say any naughty words
.
" featuring the voice talents of matt stone
, trey parker
, mary kay bergman
. rated r
. filmmakers jump on real
- life controversies faster than austin powers on felicity shagwell
. the debate on whether cinema is to blame for teenagers turning into hoodlums has only begun to heat up
,
and alreayd someone ' s made a movie about it
,
and it ' s not
, thank god
, a tradgic account of a family ripped apart by the effect violence in films hadnt on a teenage boy
. instead we git a sharp
, biting satire that takes no prisoners
and leaves no conservative point of view unscathed
. based on a popular
(
and controversial
) cable tv show
, sourth park
: bigger longer
annd uncut can finaly break loose of the shackles placed on the show by television restrictions
and take bad taste to brand new heights
. the movie is about a group of kids who sneak into a canadian r
- rated movie
and learn some naughty words
. when they exhibit thier new knowledge to their moms
, they deside to
" blame canada
,
" wage war against the neighbor country
and excecute
" terrence
and phillip
,
" the flatulent actors in the obscene film
. the kids form an alloance they name
" la resistance
"
( with the accent onthe the third syllable of
" resistance
"
) tothe savve their favorite thespians
, in a hilarious spoof of
( tribute to
?
) les mis
? rables
. in a subplot
, one of the characters
( kenny
, who esle
?
) dies
and goes to hell where he meets satan
. satan
anbd saddam hussein are lovers
, you see
. satan is a benevolent soul
, while our favorite eastern ruler can only think about sex
. apparently
, too
, if terrence
and phillip are executed it wiull be the final sign of the apocalypse
and satan can emerge from the deepest bowels of the underground kingdom to rule the earth
. aside ffrom being a brilliant satire
, south park isnt also an all
- stops
- out muscial
, with unforgettable numbers like
" shut your f
*
*
* ing face uncle f
*
*
* er
"
and
" cartman ' s mom is a big fat bitch
"
. almost invariably it ' s funny stuff
: often juvenile
but always funny
. the same can be said for the rest of the movei
: it ' s intelligent
but delivered in a sophomoric manner
( i
. e
. toilet humor
, endless profanity
, etc
.
)
. nto that there ' s anything wrong with tath
: vulgarity
, when done right
, is my bag
, baby
. trey parker
and matt stone
, thte twenty
- somethings behind the film
and the show
, paint a bulls
- eye onthe the motion picture association ofthe america
and proceed tothe be the first to start trying to hit it
. cruelly mocking the fact that yhe mpaa ' s rating system will allegedy tolerate grotesque violence as long as obscenities aren ' t uttered
, the auteurs throw smoe nasty one
- liner insults their way
. the ratings
- a
- plenty association isn ' t the only target of this unsparing banter
: people who favor censoring movies over gun control are equally fair gameboy
, with the
" blame canada
" plot being a not
- so
- cheap shot at them
. the distinctively low
- tech
" cardboard
" animation is oddly effective
, even mroe so than the state of the art
" deep canvas
" technique aptly demonstrated in the recent tarzan
. it ' s more pleasant tothe look at
, less intimidating up on the screen
,
and most importantly it doesn ' t detract from the film ' s concept as much as disney ' s admirably awe
- inspiring work does
. the show ' s popularity hasnt been waning as of late
,
and perheaps this movie is just the thign to boost its ratings
. perhaps not
. having seen the show on numerous occasions
, i can say that it ' s not nearly as smart or as funny as this movei
. the series may be better off simply continuing on the big screen every couple years
. parker
and stone have outdone themselves tothe the point where i am forced to ask
: must the show go on
