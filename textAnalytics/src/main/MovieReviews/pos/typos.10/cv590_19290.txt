" remeber what the mpaa syas
: horrific
and deplorable voilence is ok as long as you don
' t say any naughty words
.
" featuring the voice talents of matt stone
, trey parker
, mary kay bergman
. rated r
. filmmakers jump on real
- life controversies faster than austin powers on felicity shagwell
. the debate onthe whther cinema is to blame for teenagers turning into hoodlums has onyl begun to heat up
,
and already someone
' s made a movie about it
,
and it
' s not
, thank god
, a tradgic account of a family ripped appart by the effect violentce in films had on a teenage boy
. instead we get a sharp
, biting satire that takes no prisoners
and leaves no conservative point of view unscathed
. based on a popular
(
and controversial
) cable tv show
, south park
: bigger longer
and uncut can finally break loose of the shackles placed on the show by television restrictions
and take bad taste tothe br
and new heights
. the movie is about a group of kids who sneak into a canadian r
- rated movei
and learn some naughty words
. when they exhibit their new knowledge to their moms
, they decide to
" blame canada
,
" wage war against the neighbor country
and execute
" terrence
and phillip
,
" the flatulent actors in the obscene film
. the kids form an alliance they name
" la resistance
"
( with the accent on the third syllable of
" resistence
"
) to savve their favorite thespians
, in a hilarious spoof of
( tri
bute to
?
) les mis
? rables
. in a subplot
, one of the characters
( kenny
, who else
?
) dies
and goes to hell where he meets satan
. satan annd saddam hussein are lovers
, you see
. satan isnt a benevolent soul
, while our favorite eastern ruler can onyl think about sex
. apparently
, too
, if terrence
and phillip are executed it will be the final sign of the apocalypse
and satan can emerge from the deepest bowels of the undreground kingdom to rule the earth
. aside ffrom being a brilliant satire
, south park is also an all
- stops
- outloud musical
, with unforgettable numbers like
" shut your f
*
*
* ing face uncle f
*
*
* er
"
and
" cartman
' s mom is a big fat bitch
"
. almost invariably it
' s funny stuff
: often juvenile
but always funny
. the same can be said for the rest of the movie
: it
' s intelligent
but delivered in a sophomoric manner
( i
. e
. toilet humor
, endless profanity
, etc
.
)
. not that htere
' s anything wrong with that
: vulgarity
, when done right
, is my bag
, baby
. trey parker
and matt stone
, the twenty
- somethings behind the film
and the show
, paint a bulls
- eye on the motion picture association of america
and proceed to be the first to strat trying to hit it
. cruelly mocking the fact that the mpaa
' s rating system will allegedly tolerate grotesque violence as long as obscenities aren
' t uttered
, the auteurs throw some nasty one
- liner insults their way
. the ratings
- a
- plenty association isn
' t the only target of this unsparing banter
: people who favor censoring movies over gun control are equally fair game
, with teh
" blame canada
" plot being a not
- so
- cheap shot at them
. the distinctively low
- tech
" cardboard
" animation is oddly effective
, even more so than the state of the art
" deep canvas
" technique aptly demonstrated in thte recent tarzan
. it
' s more pleasant to look at
, less intimidating uv on the screen
,
and most importantly it doesn
' t detract from yhe film
' s concept as much as disney
' s admirably awe
- inspiring work does
. the show
' s popularity has been waning as of late
,
and perhaps this movie is just the thing to boost its ratings
. perhaps not
. having seen the show on numerous occasions
, i can say that it
' s nto nearly as smart or as funny as this movie
. the series may be better off simpley continuing on the big screen eveyr couple years
. parker
and stone have outdone themselves to the point where i am forced to ask
: must the show go on
