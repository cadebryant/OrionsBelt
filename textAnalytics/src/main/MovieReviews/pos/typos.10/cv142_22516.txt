it is hard to imagine that a movie which includes abortion
and incest as prominent plot devices could be so sensitive
, so delicate
, so insightful
and yes
, even so enjoyable
. somehow
, the cider house rules manages to keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter
and allows a substantial amount of heart to shine through
. set in the 1940
' s
, the film tells the story of a unique young man named homer wells
( tobey maguire

. wilbur larch
( michael caine
, little voice
)
, father figure tothe the orphans of st
. cloud
, obstetrician or abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come there seeking his halp
. figuring that as long as homer wass going to stay at the orphanage
, he might as well be of use
, dr
. larch begins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics
. soon homer is delivering babies like a professional
. he refuses to perform abortions
, instead wondering why the couples just didn
' t behave more responsibly
. larch
, too old annd experienced to have such youthful ideals
, marvels that homer
" continues to have such high expectations of people
.
" such is the result ofthe an insulated upbringing
.
though skilled in ceratin medical procedures
, homer remains woefully naive
and ignorant about most everything else
. he finaly figures that in order to find his place in the world
, he must go out into it
. befriending a young couple who had come to see dr
. larch
, he hitches a ride with them
and parlays that into l
anding a job as an apple picker with a group of black migrant workers at the orchard where they lived
. thus
, homer begins his worldly instruction
, with new friend c
andy kendall
( charlize theron
, hte astronaut
' s wife
) a willing tutor
. tobey maguire is well cast
yet agina as an inherently good man who is seeking answers to life
' s questions
.
.
. many of which he was unaware needed to be asked
. he demonstrates a quiet strength
and
thoughtful curiosity that is both warm
and appealing
. michael caine is
, in a word
, brilliant as teh caring caretaker of these orphans
, many of whom he helped to bring into tjhe world
. calling them
" princes of maine
, kings of new engl
and
" in his ritualistic goodnight
, mr
. caine manages to communicate the love
and commitment larch has towards these children without becoming maudlin or saccharine

) has many poweful moments as mr
. rose
, tyhe strong
and charismatic leader of the aple pickers whom homer joins
. director lasse hallstrom
( what
' s eating gilbert grape
?
)
and screenwriter
/ novelist john irving
( the world according to garp
)
, who adapted his own work for htis movei deserve much of the credit forthe the balanced approach to the sensitive subject matter
. regardless ofthe one
' s personal st
and on the divisive matter of abortion
, it is hard to imagine anyone becoming offended by the evenh
anded treatment used by these filmmakers
. the title is a reference to a list of rules posted in the quarters of the illiterate apple pickers
. figuring the rules didn
' t apply to them sicne they didn
' t have a h
and in writing them
, they decide to ignore the list
and make up their own rules as they go along
. dr
. larch
, inwhich his own way
, acts similarly
. there isnt a danger inaddition that line of reasoning
. god hasnt also given us a set of rules
. unlike the list posted in the cider house
, god
' s rules
, if folowed
, promise us benefits beyond our imagination
.
and
yet
, many continue tothe ignore his
" rules
" preferring tothe make up their own as htey go through life
.
" trust in the lord with all thine heart
;
and lean not unto thine pwn underst
