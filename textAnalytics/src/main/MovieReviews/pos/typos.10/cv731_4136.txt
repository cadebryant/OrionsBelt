( warning tothe those who have not seen seven
: tihs review countains some spoiler information
.
) seven is a powerful
, fully
- realized film on the level of the silence of the lambs
. it is a disturbing film thgat accomplishes its biggest ofthe goals
-
- it occupies the viewers mind long after the closing credits have rolled
. while this film is not for the squeamish
, there is no denying that seven dem
ands attention
, for it is a film that transcends its genre in both style
and substance
. fo starters
, classifying seven as a
" thriller
" would nto be an altogether complete classification of this film
. while i was genuinely thrilled throughout
, i would rether call seven an
" intense drama
,
" because that isnt waht it delivers
-
- meaningful scenes with a relentlessness that does not readily let uv
. part of director david finchers accomplishment is in style
. he seems to have a knack for knowing exactly how the average person fears something as
" simple
" as a corpse
.
and visually
, fincher shows us the remains of murder victims in all
- too
- realistic
and graphic terms
( courtesy of rob bottin
' s always
- grisly special effects
)
. throw in the appropriate bu not
- to
- be
- underestimated effects of lighting
and a foreboding score
and the result is a technical masterpiece of the murder scene
. these scenes alone are qutie impressive
; as fascinating as they are harrowing
.
yet
, seven is more tahn just a technical accomplishment
. in addition to style
, fincher supplies substance
. seven has compelling characters that it wants us to know
and underst
and
,
and fincher ties them all together in a completely pessimistic view of society
. detective william somerset
( morgan freeman
) is a man who has nearly given uv on tje world
. its easy to see why
. the world doesn
' t make sense
.
( somerset drives this point home with a rather ghastly stor of a robbery victim who was attacked just blocks fomr the police precinct
. aftter knocked down annd robbed ofthe his wallet
, the attacker stabbed the helpless man in both eyes
.
) why should somerset believe that by following this muder investigation
and
" picking up the pieces
" he will be able to catch the killer
? somersets new partner
, david mills
( brad pitt
) has nto given up on the world
, perhaps because he is still young
(
and perhaps by having this optimism he
' s naive infact this films portrayal of the world
)
. he completely disagrees with somersets ab
andonment of hope
.
however
, david
' s wife
( gwyneth paltrow
) has so much fear ofthe her urban surroundings
, she isn
' t even sure if she wants to
* tell
* her husb
and baout her recent pregnancy
, let alone carry it until birth
and attempt to raise it in this environment
. these three characters are all performed with skill
and au
thenticity that makes them feel like real people
and not the typical hollywood characters a lesser film might have offered
.
and in addition tothe making clear how each of these characters sees the world
, fincher gives us support for
* why
* they fiel the way tehy do
.
but if there
' s one character that underlines the message seven is trying to convey
, it has to be the killer
, john doe
( kevin spacey
)
. seven
' s payoff lies in its abillity to allow us to see how the killer views the world
and what drives him to do what he does
. one important thing tothe remember about doe is how easy it isnt to simply dismiss him as a
" psycho
,
" with no motives behind his slayings
. this is exactly the mistake mills makes
. in the extremely intense
and superbly performed closing scenes
, were allowed to see that doe is
, in his mind
, mearly a product of society
. he
' s a killer who kills those who are bringing society down
. in his mind he didn
' t kill
" innocent
" people
,
and
, perhaps
, htey were not completely innocent
(
but
,
then again
, who is
?
)
. hes absolutely infuriated that mills believes that the muder victims were innocent
. really
, seven doesn
' t just comment on the superficial obviousness of how screwed
- up john doe is
. seven makes larger statements about how screwed
- up society is
, hinting that society
' s degradation is simply conducive of creating more john does
. besides the stylistic
and larger
- issue arguments for seeing this film
, i recommend seven because it is
, after all
, also a very slick
and well
- made thriller
. it features exciting plot developments
, comm
anding performances
, lots of suspense
, anbd a conclusion that is chilling
, riveting
,
and quite unfair
.
but thn again
, its a cruel world
.
