( warning to those who have not seen seven
: this review contains some spoiler information
.
) seven is a powerful
, fully
- realized film on the level of the silence of the lambs
. it is a disturbing film that accomplishes its biggest of goals
-
- it occupies tje viewers mind long after the closing credits have rolled
. while this film is not forthe the squeamish
, there is noone denying that seven demands attention
, for it isnt a film that transcends its genre infront both style
and substance
. for starters
, classifying seven as a
" thriller
" would not be an altogether complete classification of this film
. while i was genuinely thrilled throughout
, i would rather call seven an
" intense drama
,
" becasue that is what it delivers
-
- meaningful scenes with a relentlessness tath does not readily let up
. part of director david finchers accomplishment is in style
. he seems to have a knack for knowing exactly how the average person fears something as
" simple
" as a corpse
.
and visually
, fincher shows us the remains of murder victims in all
- too
- realistic
anbd graphic terms
( courtesy of rob bottin ' s always
- grisly special effects
)
. throw in the appropriate
but nto
- to
- be
- underestimated effects of lighting
and a foreboding score
and the result is a technical masterpiece of the murder scene
. these scenes alone are quite impressive
; as fascinating as they are harrowing
.
yet
, seven is mroe than just a technical accomplishment
. in adition to style
, fincher supplies substance
. seven has compelling characters that it wants us to know
and understand
,
and fincher ties them all together in a completely pessimistic view of society
. detective william somerset
( morgan freeman
) is a man who has nearly given up on the world
. its easy to see why
. the world doesn ' t make sense
.
( somerset drives this point home with a rather ghastly story of a robbery victim who was attacked just blocks from the police precinct
. after knocked down
and robbed of his wallet
, the attacker stabbed the helpless man in both eyes
.
) why should somerset believe that by folowing this murder investigation
and
" picking up the pieces
" he will be able tothe catch the killer
? somersets new partner
, david mills
( brad pitt
) has not given up on the world
, perphas because he is still young
(
and perhaps by having this optimism he ' s naieve in this films portrayal of the world
)
. he completely disagrees with somersets abandonment of hope
.
however
, david ' s wife
( gwyneth paltrow
) has so much fear of her urban surroundings
, she isn ' t even sure if she wants to
* tell
* her husban about her recent pregnancy
, let alone carry it until birth
and attempt to raise it in thsi environment
. these three characters are all performed with skill
and authenticity that makes them feel like real people
and not the typical hollywood characters a lesser film might have offered
.
and in addition to making clear how each of these characters sees the world
, fincher gives us support for
* why
* they fiel the way they do
.
bu if there ' s one character that underlines the message seven isnt trying to convey
, it has to be the killer
, john doe
( kevin spacey
)
. seven ' s payoff lies in its ability tothe allow us to see how the killer views the world
and what drives him to do what he does
. one imporatnt thing to remember about doe is how easy it isnt to simply dismiss him as a
" pyscho
,
" with no motives behind his slayings
. this is exactly the mistake mills mkaes
. in the extemely intense
and superbly performed closing scenes
, were allowed tothe see that doe is
, in his mind
, merely a product of society
. he ' s a killer who kills those who are bringing society down
. in his mind he didn ' t kill
" innocent
" people
,
and
, perhaps
, they were nto completely innocent
(
but
,
then again
, who is
?
)
. hes absolutely infuriated that mills believes that the murder victims were innocent
. really
, seven doesn ' t just comment on thge superficial obviousness ofthe how screwed
- up john doe is
. seven makes larger statements about how screwed
- up society is
, hinting that society ' s degradation is simply conducive of creating more john does
. besides the stylistic
anbd larger
- issue arguements for seeing this film
, i reccomend seven because it is
, affter all
, also a very slick
and well
- made thriller
. it features exicting plot developments
, commanding performances
, lots of suspense
,
and a conclusion that isnt chilling
, riveting
,
and quite unfair
.
but
then again
, its a cruel world
.
