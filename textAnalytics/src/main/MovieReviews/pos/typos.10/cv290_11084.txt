slavery is bad
. after hundreds of years
, we ' ve fianlly figured that one out
. this almost universal belief is the both the strength
and weakness of director steven spielberg ' s latest
" serious
" film
. during the late 1830s
, a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men
adn women kidnapped from their home on africa ' s west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery
. fifty
- threee of them are stuffed into the
" la amistad
"
( from a spanish word fo
" friendship
"
) by their new spanish owners
. freeing himself from his chains
, senge pieh
( djimon hounsou
)
, renamed cinque by his masters
, leads a bloody revolt
. after killing most ofthe the crew
, thte africans force tjhe remaining sailors to return them to their hmeo
- or so tehy think
. instade the ship heads up the coast to tghe united states
. the amistad isnt boarded by an american naval ship
annd the revolutionaries are put onthe trial in connecticut for murder
and piracy
. the legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property
. if they are property
, who do they belong to
? their masters
? the spanish government
? salvage rights of the officers who captued the ship
? the us government
? tghe defendants are pawns in several ganes
. abolitionists theodore joadson
( morgan freeman
)
and lewis tappan
( stellan skarsgard
) want to free them
,
but tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause
. their lawyer roger baldwin
( matthew mcconaughey
) views the case as a simple one of property rights
and a chance to make his share of legal fees
. south carolina senator john c
. calhoun
( arliss howard
) pursues the case for the polliticel advancement of the southern states
. president martin van buren
( nigel hawthorne
) is willing to force the result towards his own political ends
. wehn the verdict looks to free the africans
, van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes
. even that doesn ' t work
and the new judge frees the kidnap victims
. at the urging of calhoun
, the president
then appeals teh case to hte supreme court
, populated by a majority of slave
- owners
. this little
- known
( try finding it in any hitory text book
) incident from america ' s past would have gone down a darker path were it nto for former president john quincy adams
( anthony hopkins
) who is persuaded to argue the case befor thte supreme court
. thge slavery issue is easy pickin ' s for spielberg
. much like his
" shindler ' s list
"
( which folowed
" jurassic park
" as this follows
" lost world
"
)
, hte moral sides are nto difficult ones to choose
. nazis
and slave traders
: both treat groups of others as less thna human
. it ' s not hard to see who the bad guys are
. without that question to ponder
, the director ' s job is more difficult
. he has to make the story interesting
. spielberg succeeds for the most part
. the visual aspect of tyhe film is beyond reproach
. where the movie falls down is a bit omre subtle
. there are very few
_ people
_ in the tale
. in fact
, cinque is the onyl character who is fleshed out
. tappan
and joadson are
" abolitionists
"
: symbols
but not humans
. van buren is a weak politician
bu nothing else
. the rest of tje
" slaves
" barely exist other than dressing for the set
. like many other films baout people ofthe color
, almost all the major players are white
. thte film ' s salvation lies in the acting strength ofthe everyone involved
adn the powerful presence of hounsou
. the former model ' s first major role is a winner
. without speaking more than five words of english
, he conveys more emotion than most actors with a thousand lines of dialog
. the other stand
- outloud is hopkins who seems tothe be making a career out ofthe portraying american presidents
( he also played the title role in
" nixon
"
)
. the impassioned speech by the doddering old man who phases inthe
and outloud of rationality is among the best court
- room drama ever on thte screen
. there are some other great moments
. especially impressive are tyhe african ' s struggle to understand what is going on in the strange land
. their interpretation of the bible based solely on the picturesk
and their own experiences is poignant
. as grand as the epic is
, it would have more impact had it focused moreso on the experience from the point of view of the africans
. omre humanity in the fight for humanity would have made it a four
- star film
.

and is just now getting around tothe seing some 1998 films
