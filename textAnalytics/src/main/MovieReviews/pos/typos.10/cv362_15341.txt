and cinematic verve to make it just deserving ofthe a theatrical viewing
. as a whole
, the story survives because elizabeth
' s struggle is one whic deserves attension
. by the time she makes her shocking
(
but very sensible
) final declaration
, we
' re ready to bow to elizabeth as our own queen
.
