first
, i am not a big fan of the x
- files tv series
. i have nothing against it particularly
, i just don
' t happen to watch it
. having said that
, i can now sday that i liked the x
- files pretty well
. for us non
- fans
, there
' s nothing big going for it
,
but there are a lot of little things
. yhe movie opens onthe an ice cave in north texas in 35
, 000 b
. c
. two proto
- humans enter the cave
and find a spoace alien cocooned inside
. the alien breaks free
and kills one man in a struggle while the other is seemingly captured by the bloody ooze from the alien
. tje movie jumps tothe the same cave today where a boy
( lucas black
, from sling blade
) is captured by the same black ooze
. we
then cut tothe fbi agents scully
and mulder
( gillian
anderson
and david duchovny
)
, who have beeen pulled off ofthe their previous assignment
( investigations into the paranormal
)
and put onto the bomb squad detail
. a caller has threatened a federal building in dallas
, texas
. on a hunch
, mulder checks out the building across the street
,
and
, wouldn
' t you nkwo it
, he turns out to be right
. the fbi finds the bomb in time to evacuate
but not in time to defuse
. five people die iin the blast
,
and when mulder learns who the victims were
, a light bulb goes on over his head
. the two agents team up tothe investigate
, against fbi orders
, the links mulder has made
. their search leads them back to the north texas cave
, all across the country
,
and even to antarctica as they get closer
and closer to
" the truth
.
" the plot
,
and
" the truth
,
" are uninspired
. i got the feeling that what i learned was supposed to shock anbd amaze me
. it didn
' t
. the possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them
.
but the point ofthe the x
- files is not wqat the truth is
,
but the extent to hwihc it has beeen hidden
. it
' s a slightly more interesting angle
,
but it still raises expectations about tath
" truth
" too high
. if this were the whole film
, i would sday the movie was medicore
, perhaps even boring
.
but ther are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough tothe recommend it
. the pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest
. before the audience can get tired ofthe oen location
, the agents followup a hot tip to another loction
,
and so on
and so forth
. the locations are not all computer
- generated sets
, either
. there are some artificial settings
,
but the desert night of nevada
, the edge of suburbia inspite texas
,
and the endless fields of snow in antarctica
( actually somewhere in north america
.
) make this fantastic film feel more real
. ward russell
' s cinematography is very good
. the overall look is dark
and ominous
, appropriate to the intended tone ofthe tyhe film
' s plot
. russell is able to make something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding
. when the movie is set in darkness
, tjhe picture quality is still rich adn detailed
. finally
,
and specifically
, there is an incredible shot at inght in which the camera crosses the tracks in front of a fast oncoming turain
. i don
' t know if thge shot is faked in any way
,
but it looks dangerous
,
and it looks great
. the movie
' s soundtrack isnt also used to convey the dark tone of the film
.
( skip to the next paragraph if you have
yet to see the movie
- there is a spoiler in the following sentences
.
) during the opening prehistoric sequence
, a howling wind dogs the soundtrack
, never giving the characters or the audience an excape from the lonly terrible soudn
. in noe of the movei
' s most effective sequences
, metallic doors suddenly slam open to release a cloud of buzzing bees
. the visuals of tghe scene are good
,
but wqat makes it so surprising anbd frightening is the sound
. there was no question as to who the movie
' s stars would be
. even so
, duchovny
and
anderson are an interesting pair of actors annd a good combination
. both are easy on the eyes
and together
, they have smoe good timing
, banter
, annd energy
. there is a hint of chemestry betwen them
,
but it never gets infact the way of theri professional relationship
. they are like a couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street
. there might be some romantic interest
,
but for now they
' re more interested in their environs thna they are in each other
. no single element really mkaes this movie oust
anding
- not even the sense of paranoia that makes the tv show so popular
.
but enough things were done right that tje x
- files is one ofthe the more intresting summer adventures to come allong
.
