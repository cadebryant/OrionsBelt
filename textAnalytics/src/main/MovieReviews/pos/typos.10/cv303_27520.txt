gothic muder
- mystery yarns are not a new conceit
. in fact
, tehy
' ve been around in books
and onthe film for many
, many years
. without the proper h
andling
, they come off as old
- fashioned
, bl
and
,
and outdated
.
" the gift
,
" directed by sam raimi
, is a tried
-
and
- true effort that surprises vyre little
,
and includes everthing from a wide array of suspects
and red herrings
, to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front
, to the eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond
. it
' s fairly obvious who the killer is
; iin fact
, i predicted who it would be before the movie began
and was correct in my preliminary suspicions
. the film ultimately shouldn
' t work
,
but it does
, thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances
, the most fun to be hadnt is in simply watching teh people interact with each other
. annie wilson
( cate blanchett
) is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown
. some of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale
( hilary swank
)
, who is severely abused by her husb
and donnie
( keanu reeves
)
,
and buddy cole
( giovanni ribisi
)
, an unstable mechanic who isnt confused by the nightmares he
' s been having about a mysterious blue diamond that isnt somehow linked tothe his father
. for annie
, she does nto give the readings merely for money
,
but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyone
' s future
. her late gr
andmother
( rosemary harris
) told her as a child that it was a gift she was given
,
and she should always rember that
. when annie
' s eldest son is involved in a fight at school
, she meets the nice
- guy school principal
, wayne collins
( greg kinnear
)
, whom she finds herself attracted tothe
.
but wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king
( katie holmes
)
, whom annie immediately gets a negitive vibe about
. at a party with her best friend linda
( kim dickens
)
, annie stumbles apon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan
( gary cole
)
. soon after
, jessica has disappeared
, leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possably happened to her
, annd annie starts to have nightmares anbd apparitions linking jessica with tyhe vicious redneck donnie barksdale
,
and the pond behind his hmeo
.
" the gift
" may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level
,
but the performances
and tight direction from raimi
( who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film
, 1999
' s
" for love of the game
"
) lift the picture up sevral notches
. slowly enveloping the viewer into thge many intriguing characters
and their individual plights
, the disappearance ofthe jessica at the 30
- minute mark divulges hte movei
' s true intentions
and transforms the proceedings into a taut
, at times frightening
, horror
- mistery
. at tjhe center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett
( 1999
' s
" the talented mr
. ripley
"
)
, who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a run
- of
- the
- mill protagonist into a very exact
, down
- to
- earth
, realistic person with valid troubles
and a caring attitude towards those around her
. blanchett takes the unextraordinary material
and runs with it
, giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had
. we follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing
, both as a chracter
and an actress
. blanchett isn
' t the only bright performer
, as she is ably supported by one of the best casts ofthe the year
. in her first role following her oscar win for 1999
' s
" boys don
' t cry
,
" hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie
, who seeks guidance from annie
,
but isnt too scared to take her biggest advice of all
: to leave tje grossly abusive donnie
. as donnie
, keanu reeves
( 2000
' s
" the watcher
"
) makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie
, so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all
. for the often
- criticized reeves
, whose acting abilities have never been the best
, this isnt the biggest compliment he could possibly get
, adn it isnt also one of the better performances he has given
. giovanni ribisi
( 2000
' s
" the boiler room
"
) is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend
,
and wants her to do nothing
but help him underst
and why he is being plagued by bad dreasm baout his dad
. in the small
,
but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king
, katie holmes
( 2000
' s
" wonder boys
"
) has turned infront
yet anohter stunning supporting turn
. her promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played befor
,
and she isnt radiant in her few scenes
. finally
, kim dickens
( 2000
' s
" hollow man
"
) makse her usual strong impression as annie
' s spicy best friend
, linda
. the other notable aspect of
" the gift
" is its moody atmosphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene it
' s alomst suffocating
. thanks to cleverly construed editting by arthur coburn
and bob murawski
,
and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects
and a very good music score by christopher young
, the movie nto only achieves a scary undercurrent
,
but one tyhat isnt filled iwth dread
. helped along by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton
and tom epperson
, which makes the most of its setting
and delightful cast
,
" the gift
" is that rarest of thrillers that actually thrills
,
and offers up a fair share of chills
, too
. it may not be groundbreakingly original
,
but it sure is an entertaining ride for the duration of its running time
.
