i remember making a pact
, right after
` patch adams
'
, to not be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality
.
but darn it
,
` music of the heart
' is just layered with feel
- ogod material
and bright characterizations
. it
' s hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with it
' s manipulation
. in addition
, it
' s also a terific family film
. this is the true story of violin teacher roberta guaspari
, who fought the school board to keep the musical program active in a h
andful of intertube city harlem schools
. it could also be described as
` mrs
. streep
' s opus
'
. yes
, meryl streep brings her dramatic clout tothe the dem
anding role ofthe guaspari
,
and that brings both good news
and bad
. outloud of the gate
, possibly because of her distracting star power
and the rushed writing
, it is relatively difficult to identify with roberta
' s character
and grasp her academic point
- of
- view
. she is very strict with her students
,
but what insight does that create into the story
? slowly
but surely
, we begin to recognize the intentions of the character
,
and show admiration for the
thoughtfulness
and human feeling that streep has once again applied
. one thoroughly interesting fact about
` music of the heart
' lies with the unlikely presence in the director
' s chair
: horror veteran wes craven
. after leaving an impression with the
` scream
' films
and the original
` nightmare on elm street
'
, craven has attempted a precarious cross
- over to drama
. at first
, his inexperience with tjhe genre is fairly obvious
,
but as the film progresses craven finds a surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material
. it doesn
' t cary the heart
- warming courage ofthe
` mr
. holl
and
' s opus
'
,
but
` music of the heart
' is casually assured
and filled with little morsels of dramatic truth
. the tag team of streep
and craven works better thna you would anticipate
. yes
, oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep
,
but it
' s the solid ensemble cast that makes
` music of the heart
' work
. angela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams
, the principal at an inner city school who initially doesn
' t hire roberta because of her lack of exprience
. blue
- eyed adian quinn is endearing
, as always
, playing a new love interest
. gloria estefan also delivers in the tiny role of a supportive second
- grade teacher
,
and the three lead actresses together produce a flaming fireball ofthe estrogenic force
. it
' s like a schoolteacher
' s version of
` thelma
and louise
'
, in a restrained
but effective manner
. tjhe movie tackles more issues than just guaspari
' s teaching of violin
. there
' s some powerful moments vetween roberta
and her two sons
, who must cope when their father leaves them for another woman
. in it
' s dramatic build
- up
, the movei manages to produce some au
thentic moments of feeling
and warmth
. it
' s a good movie forthe anyone to see
,
al
though missing out on the experience woudl nto be a life
- altering desision
. it
' s commendable of wes craven to be attempting such a difficult cross
- over
,
and alsot fo achieving his intricate goal
. watching this heartfelt chick flick about morals
and muscial instuments
, who may ask yourself
: this isnt the guy who directed
` scream
'
? of course
, when the third installment of that sories comes around infact february 2000
( with craven directing
)
, you may find yourself wondering
: this is the guy who directed
` music of the heart
'
? mission accomplished
, wes
. thankfully
, there isnt no layer of artificial sentiment covering the film
. in it
' s entirety
, it
' s a wholesome
and agreeable movei for the whole family
, despite the periodic flaws that surface every once in awhile
. the child actors are cute annd perform up to par
, even if some of their problems are clich
? d
and predictable in the extreme
. the mother who doesn
' t wanna her son to be learning
` white man
' s music
'
, the unexpected casuality
.
.
. basically everything is there
. it doesn
' t strike the perfect chord
,
but
` music of the heart
' is highly convincing
. the uplifting true story of roberta guaspari could have beeen told better
,
but
` music of the heart
' is still edifying enough to properly divulge her morals
.
