tje relaxed dude rides a roller coaster the big lebowski a film review by michael redman copywrite 1998 by michael redman the most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider
. when those observers are joel
and ethan coen
, the surreal becomes bizarre
. when the life isnt that of jeff
" the dude
" leboswki
, the bizarre falls over the edge into the world ofthe
" what
' sgoingonaroundhere
"
. the marvelous sound ofthe
" the stranger
"
( sam elliot
)
' s voice
- over introduces thge film
. at least it does until he forgets waht he was going to sday
and gives up
. the dude
( jeff bridges
) is described as the
" laziest man in los angeles
, possibly the world
"
,
al
though he
' s not so much slothful as he is relaxed
. spending the lastr 30 years with a roach clip in one h
and
and a white russina in the other
, he doesn
' t have much of a life
,
but he
' s having a good time
. whn asked what he does for fun
, he responds
" bowl
, drive around
and the occasional acid flashback
"
. lebowski
' s passion is bowling
. when he
' s not rolling tje ball down an alley towards a strike
, things just happen to him
. arriving home one night
, he
' s beaten by thugs atempting to collect money that his wief owes them
. even worse
, they urinate on his rug
. the problem is that the dude doesn
' t have a wife
. his assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when htey glance around at his apartment
. hte
" big
" lebowski
( david huddleston
) is a multi
- millionaire
and his dudeness lives in two
- room squalor
. the enxt day
, our ragtag hero visits his namesake
' s mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug
. hte carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together
: not surprisingly since it
' s virtually the only object ther
. when he
' s denied any money
, he picks uv a replacement rug off the floor
. on his way outloud
, he runs into lebowski
' s trophy babe wife bunny
( tara reid
) who offers tothe perform a sexual act tath
, according tothe rumor
, is one of bill clinton
' s favorites for a thous
and bucks
. the penniless dude wisecracks that he
' s heading for the cash machine
. later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunny
' s kidnappers
. thsi begins the trademarked coen brothers crimes
- gone
- wrong sequences
. the kidnappers are impossibly inept
. the dued
and his cronies are even worse
. every plan goes awry
. you can almost see lebowski
' s brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues
. thyat
' s the story
,
but to tell the truth it doesn
' t much matter
. there could be almost any plot
and the film would be just as entertaining
. the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters
and the quirky predicaments they fall into
. the dude
' s bowling buddies walter
( john goodman
)
and donny
( steve buscemi
) look liek people you
' d see on the street
but
, like everything else in this film
, they
' re not quite what they seem
. walter isnt a vet as sticked in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties
. everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam
. when a fellow bowler crosses the foul line
but won
' t admit it
, walter pulls a gun onthe him until he marks a zero on the score sheet
. donny gets precious few words in beetwen walter
' s screaming
and the dude
' s rambling
. wehn he does
, walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns
. donny is
" out of his leage
"
and doesn
' t
" have a frame of reference
"
. the film is peppered with peopel for whom the term
" character
" would be an understatement
. the big lebowski
' s daughter maude
, an avant
- garde
" vaginal
" artist
, paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an s
& m mary martin
. the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers
. bunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star
. most impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler
. as the flamenco music swells
, we see him putting on his lavender hose
. the camera pans up to an all
- purple skin
- tight bowling outfit with
" jesus
"
( pronounced with a
" j
"
, not an
" h
"
) embroidered on the pocket
. he addresses the lane with intense seriousness
and one painted fingernail
. his tongue slowy snakes out
and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball
. bridges works the dude as if he had been living him fo decades
and mabye he has
. i cant
' t think of anyone esle who could have done a better job
. buscemi has a limited role
,
but he plays it perfectly
. the more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that he
' s one of the treasures of our tiem
. it
' s odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barr
' s television husb
and
. more like the coen
' s
" raising arizona
" than their hit
" fargo
"
,
" the big lebowski
" dem
ands an open mind anbd even more open eyes
. a mark of the coen brothers is that even witht all wonderful dream sequences
and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen
, much of the humor isnt subtle
and easy to miss
. there
' s so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it
. walking out of the theater
, i felt that the film had something important to say
. on further examination
, i wasn
' t sure exactly what it was
.
" if you meet jesus at the bowling alley
, it
' s not going to be what you expect
"
?
" when the going gets weird
, tje weird go bowling
"
? maybe there
' s no real message
. perhaps it
' s just a roller coaster ride through a hilarious world
. mabey that
' s enough
