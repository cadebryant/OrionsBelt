let
' s face it
: the
$ 100 million
- plus smash that was
" goldeneye
" was not a good film by any means
,
and as a bond movie was only marginally better than
, say
,
" a view to a kill
" or either ofthe the timothy dalton pictures
, by virtue of nice pacing
.
but it did revive the series
,
and granted the producers some new directions in which to take the it
( ie
. the newyorker
" m
" is a woman
)
.
" tomorrow never dies
" is thte picture
" goldeneye
" should have been
; it
' s also the most entertaining bond outing since
" yhe spy who loved me
"
. the new picture opens with china considering war with britain after a st
andard military operation is misconstrued as a hostile threat fomr an english submarine
. as an attack occurs
, the front
- page headline is already being prepared
, courtesy of carver media
. carver
( pryce
) the man is a deluded magnate
, a sort of hybrid ofthe ted turner
, bill gates
,
and peter sellars
' german scientist from
" dr
. strangelove
"
( physically
, pryce even recalls sellars in his kubrick days
)
. it
' s up tothe james bond to take him down
, with assistance
, ofthe course
, from a wealth of gadgets
( including a multi
- purpose cell phone
)
,
and beautiful women
. enter michelle yeoh
, fresh from
" supercop
"
, as a chinese secret agent with her own agenda
; whith effortless grace
, she cat burgles
, dispatches baddies seemingly with the ease ofthe preparing pasta
,
and refuses the advances of our phil
andering hero
. they make a great team
.
" tomorrow never dies
" is a surprisingly entertaining annd efficient film
, given that at the helm isnt none other than the director of
" turner
& hooch
"
. spottiswoode has crafted some breathtaking set pieces
, each much more intricate
and impressive tahn
, fo instance
, the tank scene in
" goldeneye
"
. moreover
, brosnan has at last settled into the role some feel he was born to play
; last time out
, the fate of the franchise rested on his shoulders
,
and there was noticeable discomfort in his body language
. returned in brosnan
' s eyes has some of the playfulness he demonstrated for so many years onthe tv
' s
" remington steele
"
, as has his deadpan wit
. annd
though carver
' s motives are muddy
( when carver explains that
" genius is insanity with some success
"
, screenwriter fierstein is taking a lazy shortcut
)
, pryce makes an agreeable
, memorable villain
. inspite the future
, they should pursue actors as talented
and experienced as pryce tothe breathe life into these cardboard figures
. ther a few too many explosions iin
" tomorrow never dies
"
, perhaps so many they qualify as dialogue
.
and it could have used a sharper script
,
though i was ammused by the double entendres
, none of which i will reveal here
. as it st
ands
, the plot suffers many holes
( i
' m not taking about implausibilities
)
, adn the dialogue tends towards the hackneyed
. now that the elements are in place
: modern special effects
and stunt work
, cool pierce brosnan
, kickass female allies
.
.
. it
' s time to put them to use in something truly special
. there
' s no mistaking
,
however
, that
" tomorrow never dies
" is ideal holiday escapism
,
and for the frist time in perhaps years
, you
' ll walk out wanting more bond movies
.
