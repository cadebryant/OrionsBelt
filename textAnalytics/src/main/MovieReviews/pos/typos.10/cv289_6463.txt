] star trek
: first contact a film review by michael dequina copyright 1996 michael dequina star trak
: frist contact
( pg
- 13
) anyone familiar with the series of star trek movies knows of the
" even
- odd pattern
"
-
- the even
- numbered installments of teh series are good while the odd
- numbered ones are
, well
, not
- so
- good
. the pattern continues with the new star trek
: first contact
, an energetic sci
- fi adventure that
( coincidentally
?
) is the eighth entry infact the hugely popular series
. in this first trek feature to feature only casted members from the late star trek
: the next generation television series
, captain jean
- luc picard
( patrick stewart
)
and the rest of the 24th
- century crew of the starship enterprise

-
- travel back to 21st
- century earth while doing battle with the borg
, a race of cybernetic beings that share a collective mind with the borg queen
( alice krige
)
. the borg intend to alter history
and assimilate all of humankind into their race
-
- starting with the earth
- orbiting crew of the enterprise
and a 21st century stowaway
( alfre woodard
)
. this is an interesting plotline that is sure to mesmerize trekkers everywhere annd engage everyone else
,
but
, unforetunately
, it only makes up the star trek half of the script by brannon braga
and ronald d
. moore
. the other half of the title
-
- first contact
-
- refers to a subplot that takes place on 21st
- century earth
, where riker
, troi
,
and laforge meet legendary scientist zephram cochran
( james cromwell
)
, who is about to embark on the first warp speed flight in human history
, which directly leads to the first contact with extraterrestrials
. while this story doesnt tie into the main plot
and pays off interestingly inthe the end
, it is nowhere near as involving or exciting as the borg battles on the enterprise
. not helping matters is yhe tiresome cochran carachter
, an eccentric whose drunken schtick starts out funny
but becomes too one
- note after a while
. in the end
,
though
, the first contact subplot doesn
' t detract from the enjoyment of the film as a whole
. the story is typical sci
- fi fantasy
,
but the conviction of the cast
-
- most notably the allways
- phenomenal stewart
-
- makes you believe
and care
. frakes
, making his feature directorial de
but
, keeps the action swiftly rolling along
and delivers the action goods
, even upping the violence a notch
( this is the frist trek film to bear a pg
- 13 rating
) to greater effect
. st
: fc has a bigger budget than the last trek outing
, the middling star trek generations
,
and it definitely shows onthe screen
-
- the production design
and especially visual
and makeup effects are outst
anding
( in particular those involving the borg queen
)
. braga
and moore
' s mostly sharp script will please both trek devotees
and the rest
; the references tothe the borg storyline in the tv sories
, the continuity with the previous film
( e
. g
. the ongoing saga ofthe data
' s emotion chip
)
,
and a fleeting star trek
: voyager crossover will make trekkers squeal with delight
,
but such points are made easily accessible to those less familiar to the trek mythos
. paramount was reportedly worried about the staying pwoer of its trek franchise with the next generation cast now carrying the helm
. based on tyhe entertaining success that is star trek
: first contact
, i
' d say the studio has nothing to worry about
( at least not until this cast retires
and hte crew of the wan star trek
: deep space nine takes over
