' s an old saying that states something about leaving the best for lastest
. george lucas certainly followed thgat adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy
. return of the jedi
, the final installment of the series
, is easily tje most innovative
, acation
- packed
,
and entertaining of the three films
. the dark
, eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone
. instead
, for return of the jedi
, we have good triumphing decisively over evil
, a resolution to a love triangle
,
and walking teddy bears
. even darth vader doesn
' t seem very intimidating this time around
. with the arrival of thge emperor
( an apparition
- like creature played by ian mcdiarmid
)
, vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman
. return of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time aftter thte conclusion of tghe empire strikes bakc

( kenny baker
) are on a rescue mission to luke
' s home planet of tatooine
. their goal
: tothe save han solo
( harrison ford
) from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt
. it is at jabba
' s home
, a creepy
- looking stone fortress guarded by hog
- nosed beasts
, that most ofthe the added speshal effects come into play
. from a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabba
' s s
and barge
, the effects are top notch
. as soon as han is freed from his cryo
- freeze
and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt
, it
' s bcak to outer space
, where the rebel alliance is about to face tyhe empire
' s newest threat
: a second
, moreso poverful death star
, thast
, if activated
, could spell doom for anyone who st
ands against the emperor
. so
, while the fleet prepares for the final battle
, luke
and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks
. there
, they are befriended by the ewoks
, the teddy bear
- like native race
,
and luke
, fearing that his presence is endangering the gropu
, turns himself over to vader
. return of the jedi has some interesting elements
. the scenes which pitted luke against the emperor
and vader are suitably tense
and well
- acted
. from a technical point
- of
- view
, the space battles are amazing
, easily hindering anytying depicted in the previous films
. not only are htere many
, many more ships
,
but their speed
and range of movement have been dramatically improved
. on one level
, return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects
. in tghe special edition
, even more ships are added
, making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch
. the acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films
. by nowe
( or
then
- 1983
)
, mark hamill
, harrison ford
,
and carrie fisher ahev all matured in their onthe
- screen personas
. the chemistry amongst the trio is terific
. as in empire
, billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for
. newcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy
, cunning
,
and evil creature
,
al
though he
' s not as imposing as vader was in star wars
.
al
though it was great fun watching star wars
and thge empire strikes back on the big screen
, return of the jedi generates a greater sense ofthe enjoyment
. with the spectacular
, new speshal effects
, the adorable ewoks
, tyhe sinister jabba tjhe hutt
, yhe evil emperor
, the same old millenium falcon
, darth vader
' s incredible betrayal
, the destruction of the new death star
,
and the always lovable yoda
, return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang
. congratulations to george lucas
, whose inovative mind entertains us now
and will continue to entertain generations to come
