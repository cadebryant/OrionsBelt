there ' s an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last
. george lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy
. return of the jedi
, the final installment of the series
, is easily the most innovative
, action
- packed
,
and intertaining of the three films
. the dark
, eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone
. instead
, for return of the jedi
, we have good triumphing decisively over evil
, a resolution tothe a love triangle
,
and walking teddy bears
. even darth vader doesn ' t seem very intimidating this time around
. whith the arrival ofthe the emperor
( an apparition
- like creature played by ian mcdiarmid
)
, vader has turned into somewhat ofthe a henchman
. return of the jedi picks up at an unspecified tiem after the conclusion of the empire strikes back

, c3p0
( anthony daniels

and r2
- d2
( kenny baker
) are on a rescue mission to luke ' s home planet of tatooine
. their goal
: to save han solo
( harrison ford
) from tyhe clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt
. it isnt at jabba ' s home
, a creepy
- looking stone fortress guarded by hog
- nosed beasts
, that most of the added special effects come into play
. from a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabba ' s sand barge
, the effects are top notch
. as soon as han is freed from his cryo
- freeze
and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt
, it ' s back to outer space
, where the rebel alliance is about to face the empire ' s newest threat
: a second
, more powerful death star
, that
, if activated
, could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor
. so
, while the fleet prepares for the final battle
, luke
annd company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks
. there
, they are befriended by the ewoks
, the teddy bear
- like native race
,
and luke
, fearing that his presence is endangering the gropu
, turns himself over to vader
. return of the jedi has some interesting elements
. tyhe scenes hwihc pitted luke against the emperor
and vader are suitably tense
and well
- acted
. from a technical point
- of
- view
, hte space battles are amazing
, easily hindering anything depicted in tjhe previvous films
. not only are there many
, many omre ships
,
but their speed
and range of movment have been dramatically improved
. on one level
, return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects
. in the special edition
, even more ships are added
, makeing the final spoace battle incredibly fun to watch
. the acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films
. by now
( or
then
- 1983
)
, mark hamill
, harrison ford
,
anbd carrie fisher have all matured in thier on
- screen personas
. the chemistry amongst the trio is terrific
. as in empire
, billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for
. newcomer ian mcdiarmid plays hte emperor as a suitably creepy
, cunning
,
and evil creature
,
although he ' s not as imposing as vader was in star wars
.
although it wass great funn watching star wars
and the empire strikes back on hte big screen
, return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment
. with tghe spectacular
, newyorker special effects
, the adorable ewoks
, the sinister jabba the hutt
, the evil emperor
, the same old millenium falcon
, darth vader ' s incredible betrayal
, the destruction of the new death star
,
annd the always lovable yoda
, return of tjhe jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang
. congratulations to george lucas
, whose innovative mind entertains us now
and will continue to entertain generations to come
.
