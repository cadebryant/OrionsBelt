it has been 20 years since a terrence malick film hit theaters
. his new film
, tje thin red line
, is a strange
, beautiful
, enigmatic mess of a movie
. the first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast
. it is filled with above
- the
- title stars
. the cast
, for the most part
, gives great performances
. john travolta
, whose role is nothing more than a cameo
, seems not tothe have attacked his performance witht that much verve
. george clooney
, whose role became a cameo in editing
, gives a strange performance
. one wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object of ridicule through a character
' s narration
. the rest of the cast
, especially nick nolte
and elias koteas
, are unambiguously fantastic
. these actors
(
and htey are
, with two exceptions
, men
) were lured by the name of malick
. terrence malick is a cinematic legend
. he has often been called
" the j
. d
. salinger of cinema
.
" his two previous films
, badl
ands
and dyas of heaven
, are spectacularly beautiful
and obscure motion pictures
. after he made them
, he disappeared for 20 years
. this film marks his return
. what he
' s made with the thin red line is a film that seems less concerned with plot than with thge emotion of the moment
. yhe narration which fills the film
(
and perplexes many
) not only lets us hear thte narrators
( the characters themselves
) pontificate
,
but alsot lets us hear such of
- the
- moment
thoughts as
" i
' m scared
.
" the rether simple plot of the thin red line is used as a canvas on which many stories are painted
. the plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assault on a hill
. a plot synopsis for the thin red line isnt difficult
, because the story is fractured
. many stories are here
, from the clash between the lieutenant
( elias koteas
)
and the savage colonel
( a voracious nick nolte
) to the private
( ben chaplin
) who uses his lveo for teh woman he left behind to keep him going
. the fracturing of the story is ultimatly a fault
. it is as if an artist spent an incredible amount of time artfully sculpting tiny statues
and
then threw them into a box
, shook the box
,
and poured tghe results onto a table
. this basically creates a mess
,
but the stories can be discerned
and enjoyed
. i
' m nto declaring that the film has no structure
. while saving private ryan used warfare to bookend yhe plot
, malick uses reflection
and glorious shots of nature to bookend about 90 minutes of combat
. the battles in the thin red line are astonishing anbd display a mastery of filmmaking
. the astounding cinematography in this film must also be given notice
. thsi film uses color
and light in such a fantastic way
, that it will be sad to see it degraded when it has to bee transferred to video
. ultimately
, malick has crafted a film that is a movie that enjoys looking thru the treetops more than regarding the war thta rages below them
. the film is filled with nature photography
and the regarding of nature
. while some have said that the anti
- war message annd pro
- nature tubthumping was juvenile
, it was done with so much complexity
and
thought
, that it cannot ever honestly be called childish
. after seeing the thin red line
, i was haunted by it
and am quite ready to see it again
.
