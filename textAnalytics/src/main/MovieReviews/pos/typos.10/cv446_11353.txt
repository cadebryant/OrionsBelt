" desperate measures
" was something i was excited about seeing back when it was originally scheduled tothe be released
: summer
' 97
. for some reason
, it was delayed until hollywood
' s traditional dumping ground
: january
. now that it
' s out
, i see no real reason for that delay
, as it
' s a simple
yet highly entertaining film
. michael keaton stars as a maniacial murderer who
' s bone marrow can save the life of the dying son of a san francisco police detective
( garcia
)
. keaton agrees to the transplant
, onyl so he can attempt escape
. he succeeds
, in a plan that of course coudl only work in the movies
. tje police force is nowe trying to kill keaton
, while garcia is working against them trying to keep keaton alive in order to save his son
. the film definately has it
' s flaws
. the plot is strictly tv movie of the week fare
,
but the acting
and direction certainly boost it far above that status
. also
, after keaton
' s escape
, garcia
' s captain barks at him
" how many men have to die to save your kid
' s life
?
" whihc the film treats as such an evil
and insignificant remark
. the thing is
, it
' s a vaild point
. how many people ahve to be needlessly crippled
, burned
,
and killed just to save this one child
? what
' s the greater good here
? many lives or one life
? if movies really had guts nowadays
, i would have loved to have seen this movie come down to a final choice for garcia
' s character
. place him in a situation where he knows that he has to kill keaton because keaton is about to kill someone else
. alas
, movies these days generally have no such ambition to pull the audience
' s strings in ways which might make the uncomfortable
. dispite a few silly moments
( adn one or two really stupid ones
)
, the good things about
" despreate measures
" outnumber the bad
. the main highlight would be keaton
' s performence
. the character could have easily beeen an overacting
, scene chewing freak
,
but keaton underplays it nicely
. he
' s not as menacing as he ws in
" pacific heights
" or even as menacing as he was in
" batman
"
( yes kids
, batman used to be a dark charactor
)
,
but you certainly get the idea that he
' s evil
. even tyhe final scene of the film
, which normally i would just hate
, seems strangely appropriate forthe this film
. so much so thgat i didn
' t mind it in the slightest
.
and another bonus
: the film takes place in san francisco
, which usually means a car chase on those hills that you
' ve seen a billion times befoer
.
and for a moment
, it looked as
though it was baout to happen
.
but it doesn
' t
,
and that
' s creative
.
