insane
( bu inspired
) musical about alferd packer
, the first man ever tried for cannibalism in america
. as the story unfolds we learn what events led to packer
( trey parker
) suposedly killing
and eating the five men who got lost while accompanying him through the mountains ofthe colorado in search of gold
. throughout
, packer must contend with evil trappers bent on stealing his prized horse
, a tribe of
` ute
' indians that doesn
' t seem quite on the mark
,
and a terrible winter storm that leads to the eventual cannibalism
. parker obviously knows his musicals very well
, because the viewer is also treated to some of the most maddeningly catchy songs to appear in a film
( he would accomplish this again in his post
- cannibal
! musical motion picture
, south park
: bigger
, longer
,
and uncut
)
. apart from the inherent interest of seing a pre
-
" south park
" parker
and stone in their first effort
, cannibal
! also offers up some pretty decent laughs
. the aforementioned
` ute
' indian tribe tht packer
' s group encounters is a definite highlight
, as are two rousing musical numbers about snowmen
( one of which ends on a comedically deadly note
)
. stone
' s humphrey character steals the sohw
, especially when complaining about the prospect of having to
` eat
butt
' or revealing what
' s underneath his muff cap
. jason mchugh
' s character of mr
. miller is the st
and out performence
though
, as he offers a hilarious dissenting voice to the procedings
. as i mentioned before
, parker
' s songs are very catchy
. you
' ll be hard pressed to get
` it
' s a shpadoinkle day
' out of your head once you
' ve heard it
( incidentally
, the braniff logo that appears at the end of every
" south park
" episode is scored with a few notes from this song
)
. other songs you
' ll fidn yourself humming include
` when i wass onthe top of you
'
( a love ballad
)
,
` hte trapper
' s song
'
( the villains leit motif
)
,
and
` hang teh bastard
'
( the rousing finale
)
. thankfully
, none of these songs are quite as embarrassing to find yourself singing in public as south park
: bigger
, longer
& uncut
' s songs are
. released as a pick
- up through troma studios
, the film is available on videocassette
and dvd
. the videocassette includes an intro by the beautiful jane jensen
and an interview segment with lloyd kaufman
, discusting his admiration for parker
and stone
and the fact that they had beeen hired for a zucker brothers film
( which turned out to be the hilarious baseketball
)
. there are also multiple trailers for upcoming troma films
. as for the dvd
.
.
. well
, that
' s a different sotry
. probably noe of teh best dvd packages of tyhe year
(
and potentially of all time
)
, cannibal
! tje musical
! the dvd is a massive achievement
. presented in 1
. 33
: 1
( full frame
) only
, the disc hasnt the usual troma inclusions
: the tour of troma
, the troma intelligence test 2
, trailers for upcoming releases
,
but where the disc truly shines is in its cannibal
! specific extras
. the first thing i must note is
, the transfer isnt about as beautiful as any i
' ve ever seen on any disc
. the picture is crisp
, clear
,
and free from any noticeable artifacts
. add to thgat one of the funniest commentary tracks i have ever heard
, featuring trey parker
, matt stone
, jason mchugh
, dian bachar
,
and
andy kemler getting drunker
and drunker as the track continues
and you still haven
' t scratched the surface of the extras
. there
' s also behind the scenes footage of the shooting of tjhe film
, a clip with trey
, matt
,
and lemmy
( of the b
and motorhead
) from the film terror firmer
, an index for easy location ofthe all of the songs infront the film
, annd finally
, an index ofthe all the songs as performed by the cast of a stage production of cannibal
!
. it
' s good to see this film finally get the treatment it deserves
. kudos to the entire production staff at troma
and aix for making one of the most entertaining dvds i have seen in a vyer long time
.
