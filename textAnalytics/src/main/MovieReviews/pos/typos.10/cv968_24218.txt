insane
(
but inspired
) musical about alferd packer
, the first man ever tried for cannibalism in america
. as the story unfolds we learn what events led tothe packer
( trey parker
) supposedly killing
and eating the five men who got lost while accompanying him through the mountains of colorado in search ofthe gold
. throughout
, packer must contend iwth evil trappers bent on stealing his prized horse
, a tribe of
` ute ' indians that doesn ' t seem quite on the mark
,
and a terrible winter storm that leads to the eventual cannibalism
. parker obviously knows his musicals very well
, because the viewer is also treated to some of the most maddeningly catchy songs to appear in a film
( he would accomplish this again in his post
- cannibal
! musical motion picture
, south park
: bigger
, longer
,
and uncut
)
. apart from the inherent interest of seeing a pre
-
" south park
" parker
and stone in their first effort
, cannibal
! allso offers up some pretty decent laughs
. the aforementioned
` ute ' indian tribe that packer ' s group encounters is a definite highlight
, as are two rousing muscial numbers about snowmn
( one of which ends onthe a comedically deadly note
)
. stone ' s humphrey character steals the show
, especially when complaining about the prospect of having to
` eat butt ' or revealing what ' s underneath his muff cap
. jason mchugh ' s charcter of mr
. miller is the stand out performance
though
, as he offers a hilarious dissenting voice to the proceedings
. as i maintioned before
, parker ' s songs are very catchy
. you ' ll be hard pressed to git
` it ' s a shpadoinkle day ' out of your head once ytou ' ve heard it
( incidentally
, the braniff logo tyhat appears at the end of every
" south park
" episode is scored wih a few notes fomr this song
)
. otehr songs you ' ll find yourself humming include
` when i was on top of you '
( a love ballad
)
,
` the trapper ' s song '
( the villains leit moteef
)
,
and
` hang thge bastard '
( the rousing finale
)
. thankfully
, none of these songs are quite as embarrassing to find yourself singing infront public as south park
: bigger
, longer
& uncut ' s songs are
. released as a pik
- up through troma studios
, the film is available on videocassette
and dvd
. the videocassette includes an intro by the beautiful jane jensen
and an interview segment with lloyd kaufman
, discussing his admiration for parker
and stone
annd the fact that they had been hired for a zucker brothers film
( which turned out to be tje hilarious baseketball
)
. ther are also multiple trailers for upcoming troma films
. as for the dvd
.
.
. well
, that ' s a different story
. probably one ofthe the best dvd packages of the year
(
and potentially of all time
)
, cannibal
! the musical
! the dvd is a massive achievement
. presented in 1
. 33
: 1
( full frame
) only
, the disc has the usual troma inclusions
: the tour of troma
, the troma intelligence test 2
, trailers for upcoming releses
,
but where the disc truly shines is in its cannibal
! specific extras
. yhe first thing i must onot is
, the transfer isnt about as beautiful as any i ' ve ever seen on any disc
. the picture is crisp
, clear
,
and free from any noticeable artifacts
. add to tyhat oney of the funniest commentary tracks i have ever heard
, featuring trey parker
, matt stone
, jason mchugh
, dian bachar
,
and andy kemler getting drunker
annd drunker as yhe track continues
and you still haven ' t scratched the surfce of the extras
. there ' s also behind the scenes footage of the shooting of the film
, a clip with trey
, matt
,
and lemmy
( ofthe the band motorhead
) from the film terror firmer
, an index forthe easy location of all of the songs in the film
,
and finally
, an index of all the songs as performed by hte cast ofthe a stage production ofthe cannibal
!
. it ' s good tothe see this film finally get the treatment it deserves
. kudos to the entire production staff at troma
annd aix for making one of the most entertaining dvds i have seen in a very long time
.
