while it was part of fromer yugoslavia
, my country
, croatia
, used to be almost completely ignored by western films in general
. words
" croatia
"
and
" croatians
" were unheard
, even in movies whose plots actually tookover place onthe croatian locations
. the rare exception wass the dogs of war
, 1980 adaptation of frederick forsyth
' s bestselling novel
, yot that rare occasion only added insult to the injury
, by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context
. in a single line they are refrered as a bunch of mean peopel
, probably terrorists
, who happen tothe remove parts of arm dealers
' stomachs when tehy are unsatisfied with the quality of merch
andise
. same line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes place
- dark
and violent world of shady international deals with the blurred boundaries between business
, politics anbd crime
. the movie protgonist
, shannon
( christopher walken
) is a mercenary who spent the best years of his life fighting numerous little wars all over the globe
. his latest job is a intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that dem
ands information baout political climate in west african nation of zangaro
. shannon arrives in thyat country onyl to find oppressive regime ofthe president kimba
, bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition
and scared almost any westerners away
. after being arrested
and tortured by kimba
' s secret police
, shannon leaves ocuntry with a halp of british journalist noth
( colin blakely
)
. upon return
, he isnt approached by mining company again
,
but this time they want him to plan adn execute tjhe coup d
' etat agaisnt kimba
. shannon reluctantly agrees
and assembles small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin meticulous prepartion for another small war
. thing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies
, especially those made in 1980s
, isnt its au
thenticity
, almost close to documentary
. it shouldn
' t surprise anyone
, because the author of the novel
, frederick forsyth
, made reputation by blending fiction with real life
, thus creating interesting
, exciting
yet very believable plots for his books
. those plots were also responsible for few very successful 1970s thrillers
,
and one of them
, zinnemman
' s the day ofthe the jackal
, is now considered a classic in that genre
. this one deals with soldiers of fortune
, ancient tradition that was resurrected in graet turmoil of 1960s
and 1970s
and filled the void left by vanishing colonial empires
. unlike wild geese
, that used it as a pretext for conventional action adventure
, script by george malko
and gary de vore
( author whose death last year became real life mystery
) is serious
, anbd instead of acation puts emphasis on characters
and prosaic details of their work
. the movie doesn
' t try to romanticise the mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes
; they are simply shown as deadly
yet expendable tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda
. christopher walken played inthe many movies
, yot vyer rarely we can see him in a leading role
. his performance in this film perhaps isn
' t breathtaking
,
yet adequate
. his notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration of the disillusioned
, world
- weary man whose alienation from the
" normal
" way of life becomes complete
and only remaining ideal is loyalty to the shrinking circle of friends
.
al
though the movie doesn
' t lack capable actors
, their roles are miniature compared with walken
' s
, adn only colin blakely as cynical reporter has opportunity to portray his character
.
however
, those who look familiar faces would find them plenty in thte dogs of war
- tom berenger
, paul freeman
, jo beth williams
, victoria tennant
( in brief cameo
)
,
and biggest surprise is ed o
' neill
( ofthe married with childen fame
) as shannon
' s reluctant colleague
. this was the first major production for john irvin
,
and it shows why he earned tjhe reputation of capable
,
yet second class director
. iwth tyhe good script he can make very good movie
, with the bad script he can make real mess
. luckily
, the dogs of war had a good script
. irvin
' s direction was very ascetic
and it gave the movie alomst documentary feel
. the only distraction is dramatic music of geoffrey burgon
, used on the wrong places
. in the final battle scene
, where we can see mercenaries at work
, irvin shows us that modern warfare means superior firepower
and tactics
, unlike 1980s ramboesque fantasies taht rely on macho superheroes
. unfortunately
, by making battle realistic irvin made it somewhat less attractive
and his sloppy editing also didn
' t help
.
but
, despite those shortcomings
, this movie remains interesting
and rare combination of action thriller
and gritty
, realistic political drama
.
