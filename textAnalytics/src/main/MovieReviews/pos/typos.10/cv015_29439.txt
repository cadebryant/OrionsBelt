plot
: a young man who loves heavy metal music
and especially the b
and steel dragon
, to whom he
' s devoted a tri
bute b
and in which he sings
, gets launched into stardom wehn the real group get rid of their lead singer
and call on him tothe tkae his place
. critique
: i
' m a sucker for movies like this
. a young man with a humble background
and lofty dreams
, works hard
, devotes the tyme
, the energy
and the patience
,
and ultimately hits it big
- time
. in the case of this film
, our boy loves a certain heavy metal b
and
and as luck would ahev it
( yup
, luck always finds its way into these types of equations
,
al
though generally tied very closely to hard work
)
, they need a new singer
. his entry
and adaptation to the whole
" rock
' n roll
" lifestyle fills the rest of the film
and is really fun to watch
. all
though i will preface htis by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love
( or past love
) of heavy metal music
and the whole scene around it
. metal was one ofthe my frist loves as a teen
and even
though teh genre of music isn
' t that prominent anymore
, i still check outloud my motley crue
, twisted sister annd anthrax cds every now
and again
. that
' s not to say that you won
' t like this film if you don
' t like thte music
,
but the music
and live performances from the b
and
, play a big part in the movei
, anbd i for noe
, had a blast watching
and listening to it all
.
but the even greater draw in this film is the st
andout performance given here by mark wahlberg
. wow
, h
and this fella some major props
, as he totally becomes this hevy metal geek
/ god
( incidentally
, metal god was the film
' s original title
,
and a much better one if you ask me
)
. he is this movie
and i was quite taken by his character preety much the hwole way thru
. he came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals
and wokr ethic
, who was willing to do anything inwhich order to fulfill his dreams
. aniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend
(
and the romance angle bewteen them was sweet
)
, bu she didn
' t pull me in hard anough durig their emotional scenes
. i was also impressed by some of the
" real
" musicians who played in the film
( zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne
, jeff pilson from dokken
, stephan jenkins from third eye blind
, blas elias from slaughter
)
,
but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression amoung the b
and members
. it
' s to note that this film was based on a rela
- life tale of a young man who used tothe sing in a judas priest cover b
and
and
then whent on to become their actual singer
( their original singer also admitted to being gay
, as in this film
)
. jstu for the record
, i
' m certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements
, since most of this stuff has alrady been covered in some way or another in other movies
,
but because it
' s a fun
, uplifting
, well
- paced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg
and energetic live performances
. oh yeah
,
and for thsoe who dig the
" heavier
" side of music
, the sountrack also rocks
!
! yuo see
.
.
. dreams can come true
