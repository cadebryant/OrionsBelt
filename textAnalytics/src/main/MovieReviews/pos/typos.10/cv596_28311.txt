back in 1998 dreamworks unveiled their first computer animated movie
" antz
"
. the film was critically acclaimed
,
and whent on to gross almost
$ 100m dollars at the domestic box office
. again in 1998 they released their traditional animated film
" the prince of egypt
"
anbd it named an instant clasic
,
and became a huge hitted as well
. on a winning streak
, they released
" thge road to el dorado
"
and it wasn ' t as big as they hoped
,
but still did ok
,
then they had the fantastic
" chicken run
" in the summer
. now in 2001 dreamworks has released what i can safely name
, oen of the top five best animated films
. shrek
( mike myers
) is about a loving
, green ogre who lives in tghe woods of duloc by himself
. surrounded by fairy tale characters
, he hopes somehow he would escape from everyone
. the ruler of duloc is the short
, heartless lord farquaad
( john lithgow
)
, who is offering a reward to all tghe fairy tale creatures
, if they are captured
and arrested
. ofthe course many of the owners turn them in for gold
and silver
,
but noe of those creatures is donkey
( eddie murphy
)
. a regular donkey
, except he talks
and has a definite attitude
, after his owner tries to disown him
, he escapes inot the woods
,
and runs into shrek
. lord farquaad
however
, has different plans
and makes all the fairy tale creatures in the woods near shrek ' s house
. to get his property back
,
and his life back shrek must rescue princess fiona
( cameron diaz
) so lord farquaad can be a king
. shrek wants his property back
,
but he never thought he woudl fall in love with princess fiona
.
" shrek
" is such an amazing film
, tht while watching it you can ' t help
but just smile the entire time
and wonder why that other production company can ' t make movies liek this
. the animated graphics are so great
, that htey look every bit of realistic
. i saw previews for thsi film all last year
,
and i throught to myself wow
, what a great movie htis will be
. i must say i was not disappointed at all
,
and the film is the best ofthe 2001 so far
,
and wiull go down on my best ofthe 2001 list at the end ofthe the year
. the voice talents are briliant as well
, with hte comic genuis mike myers
. in the past he has been a wayne
, an austin
,
and a person married to an ax murderer
. now he is shrek
, not only does he do the voice talent
.
.
.
bu he is shrek
. with his irish accent
,
and he lovable personality
, shrek becomes a friend to the audience
and warms your heart
. eddie murphy who showed his voice talent in 1998s
" mulan
" doesnt another bang up job here
,
and he is the comic relief in the film
. the tones ofthe his voice
, the lines he utters
,
anbd the jokes he gives
, he even outdoes the comic genius of robin williams in
" aladdin
"
. the always beautiful cameron diaz gives the voice of princess fiona
annd she does a gerat job as well
. she is very funny
,
and her character fits her to a t
. of course the best supporting voice is john lithgow
, who is personally one of my favorite actors
. he as the bad guy lord farquaad does a great job in being both sinister
and funny at the same tiem
. at times i was so amazed by the computer graphics
, that you can ' t help
bu just start looking at backgrounds
. there is many hidden jokes in the film
,
and even reflections of ight on the screen like a camera
.
" shrek
" is a definite kid film
,
but not just a kid film for it is a film for the entire family to enjoy
. there are many adult jokes in the film that tje kids won ' t get
,
but the parents will be laughing
. believe me
though
, everyone wiull be laughing the entire way through
. in the end
,
" shrek
" gives a very important message to it ' s audience to enjoy
and be who you are
. everybody out there isnt beautiful in their own way
, even
though it may be inside
. there ' s not many words tht can praise
" shrek
" enough
,
but my words to yuo is to stop what you are doing
and see this movie now
.
