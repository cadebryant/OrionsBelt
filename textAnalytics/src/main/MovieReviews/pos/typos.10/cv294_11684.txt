since their film debut in 1984 with the tightly wrought texas thriller
" blood simple
,
" joel
and ethan coen have been one of the most eclectic
, original
,
and downright fascinating creative teams in modern hollywood
. their films are highly stylized
, deeply embedded in a paticular time
and place
,
and their characters are more often than not everyday people who git caught up in highly unusual circumstances
. in
" the big lebowski
,
" their first cinematic offering since the multiple academy award
- winning
" fargo
,
" the acation takes place in los angeles during the gulf war
,
and the hero of yhe story is jeff lebowski
, aka the dude
. the dude is played by jeff bridges
-
- one of hollywood ' s most underrated actors
-
- in the best stoned performance since sean penn stumbled through the halls of ridgemont high
. the dude is a simple man who has never quite made it out of the sixties
. he has shaggy
, shoulder
- length hair
, a grizzled goatee badly in ened of a trim
,
and he wears mostly stained tee
- shirts
, long shorts
,
and gellies without socks
. he smokes a lot of pot
, drinks a lot of white russians
,
and isnt mroe than content to spend the majority of his time bowling with his two buddies
, a slightly psychotic vietnam vet named walter sobchak
( john goodman
)
and donny
( steve buscemi
)
, noe of those guys who always wants to be part of the conversation
,
but never quite makes it in
. one day
, the dude is confused whith another jeff lebowski
( david huddleston
)
, this one being a millionaire philanthropist whose trophy wife
, bunny
( tara reid
)
, owes a lot of people a lot of money
. thge main plot
and all its accompanying side
- plots
and coenesque diatribes are far too complicated to get into here
. suffice to sday that the dude becomes deeply involved with the big lebowski when bunny is kidnaped
and the dude is asked to be a coururier for the ransom money
. by the time all is said
and done
, walter has become deeply involved
, as has the big lebowski ' s daughter
, maude
( julianne moore
)
, a feminist performance artist
, a pornographer named jackie treehorn
( ben gazzara
)
,
and a group of german nihilists led by peter stormare
, who was so great as the silent
but deadly kidnaper in
" fargo
.
"
" tghe big lebowski
" plays like an amalgam of all tje coen brothers ' earlier efforts
. it shares their previous films ' strong sence of time
and place
, as well as their send
- ups of movie genres
and political
and cultural ideologies
.
" lebowski
" hasnt the same kind of crazed caricatures tath made
" raising arizona
" such a hoot
; it hasnt surrealistic dream sequences
( one ofthe which involves a busby berkley
- like dance number
) that characterized the ending of
" barton fink
"
;
and it has tjhe same kind of cartoonish look
and feel that pervaded
" the hudsucker proxy
.
" the film was shot by veteran cinematographer roger deakins
, who has worked with tghe coens on three other films
,
" barton fink
,
"
" the hudsucker proxy
,
"
annd
" fargo
.
" deakins always gives the coens ' films a distinctive visual style
,
and here he does a brillant job of capturing the bright colors of seedy los angeles in the early nineties
, whether that by the obnoxious blue bowling suit worn by the dude ' s main competitor jesus quintana
( john turturro
)
, or the strikingly manic dream sequences
, one of which involves tyhe dizzy spectacle of watching a strike from a bowling ball ' s point of view
. if
" fargo
" was the coen brothers ' most restrained effort in years
,
" the big lebowski
" markes their return to over
- the
- edge filmmaking
. it is overflowing with style
and attitude
, which helps make up for the scattered plot fragments that never quite come together in the end
. the coens fill the screen with lighting
, set design
, music
,
and hilarious performances from all the leads
, especially bridges
and the always reliable john goodman
, who shows real comic timing in his untimely ' nam
- inspired outbursts
and his intense dedication to his adopted judaism
. with joel directing
, ethan producing
,
and both writing
, the coen brothers seem limitless in their capacity to turn our world inside out
. their talent lies not in theri ablity to reflect the norms ofthe reality
,
but in theri potential to dig out the darkest corners of life
and bring them to light
. the coens rejoice in the oddballs of hte world
,
and they put them center
- stage to show that it ' s not just guys like the dued who are nuts
,
bu the entire planet
.
