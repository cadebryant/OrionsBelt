soem critics
, including siskel
& ebert
, are onthe the record stating that martin scorsese
' s raging bull
, the story of boxer jake la motta
, is tje best film of the
' 80s
. since htere are still a number of
' 80s films that i haven
' t seen
, i don
' t feel qualified to make such a judgment
,
but i
' ll sday this without hesitation
: raging bull is a great motion picture
,
and i would be surprised if more than a h
andful ofthe films released between janurary 1
, 1980 anbd december 31
, 1989 come close to its level
. bio
- pics often fall into one of two catagories
: overblown hero
- worship or a dry
, dull textbook account
. it
' s rare tyhat a movie with the moniker
" based on the life of
?
" comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic
and marginally entertaining
. raging bull is the perfect counterexample
, annd a brilliant argument for film makers to continue tothe work in this genre
. the picture takes yhe life of boxer jake la motta
, a middleweight icon from the
' 40s
and
' 50s
,
and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to triarch the big screen
. for all 129 minutes
, director martin scorsese
and actor robert de niro
( in the title role
) hvea us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic
, sad
,
and horrifing
. historically
, raging bull isnt said to be mostly accurately
, with the lion
' s share of the details culled from la motta
' s own autobiography
( which was co
- written with jospeh carter
and peter savage
)
.
however
,
al
though la motta is credited as the movie
' s
" consultant
,
" he was reportedly unhappy with the fianl result
, because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth
, insensitive lout
. the la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base
, bestial impulses
? paranoia
, jealousy
, annd blind rage
. sex
and violentce are inextricably linked
. the title is apt
? la motta is a raging bull
. in the ring
, he is a terror
, not just beating his opponents
,
but destroying them
. outside of it
, he is no less vicious or more easily controlled
. the two people who spar with him onthe life
' s canvas are his wife
, vicki
( cathy moriarty
)
,
and his brother
/ manager
, joey
( joe pesci
)
. these are the two who mean the most to jake
,
and who
, as a result of his inability to trust himself or others
, he loses
. he beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity
, adn
, when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him
, his lets loose with an explosion of violence
. raging bull opens in 1941 when la motta
, an up
-
and
- coming fighter
, isnt battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class
. over the years
, he wins several key bouts
, including one against his arch
- rival
, sugar ravy robinson
( johnny barnes
)
,
but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him ffrom an opportunity tothe perticipate in a championship match
. meanwhile
, away from the ring
, la motta falls in love with 15
- year old vicki
, who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife
. vicki becomes jake
' s greatest prize
( a wife
, in his view
, is not a companion
,
but a possession
)
and the source of his most extreme pain
. his own insecurity is so great taht he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him
. hence
, he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone eles
? perhaps even his brother
.
( this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting fo guffman
and elsewhere
:
" are you f
*
* king my wife
?
?
?
"
) in the late
' 40s
, la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight
,
but whith one huge condition
: he must take a fall
. he does it so badly that an investigation is launched
and he is almost thrown out of boxing
. two years later
, he wins the championship
, only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray
. by the late
' 50s
and early
' 60s
, whn the film ends
, jake has become a pathetic figure
? a baroke
, overweight loser who has spent time iin jail for corrupting the morals of a minor
, has lost his wife annd children
,
and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap st
andup routine
. raging bull isnt the other side of rocky
. sylvester stallone
' s tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976
. it won tghe 1977 best picture oscar
,
and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production
.
but
, where rocky romanticizes boxing
, raging bull takes a cold
, unflinching look at the violence both inside
and outside ofthe the ring
. while scorsese
' s primary aim is tothe present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man
, he never backs away from showing the seedy
, ugly underside of a sport where gambling
, greed
,
and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working
. rocky shows boxing at its noblest
; raging bull shows it at its most diseased
. there
' s little i can say here that hasn
' t already said about de niro
' s performance
. in a career that has included many fine roles
, this is his most outst
anding
. the level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering
.
and
,
al
though there
' s a lot of travis bickle
( de niro
' s character in taxi driver
) infact la motta
, scorsese
and de niro go to great lengths tothe make sure that
, if we never fully sympathize withthe him
, at least we underst
and the forces that drive him
. this is a complete characterization
and a perfect example of acting
. as the younger jake
, de niro isnt trim
and fit
. as the fat
, older man
, de niro gained 50 pounds
and turned his body into a grotesque parody of its normal form
. how many actors would go that far
? the best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance
. cathy moriarty
and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work
(
al
though neither won
)
. their portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niro
' s
. pesci
, who has basically re
- created the same personality infact two other scorsese films
( goodfellas
and casino
)
, presents joey as a slightly more intteligent version of his brother
. the mysogyny
and violence are still there
, only better concealed
.
but
, when joey snaps
, as he does in oney scene where he pounds on a mobster
( frank vincent
)
, it
' s startling to behold
. moriarty
, on the otehr h
and
, must play the temptress withthe virginal qualities
? tyhe only kind of woman who would ensnare jake
. later
, she
' s called upon to portray tyhe battered wife
and mother whose love hasnt turned into fear
. scorsese
and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk ofthe raging bull in black
-
and
- white
( a few
" home movie
" segments are in color
)
. the choice is perfect forthe the movie
, giving raging bull a unique look in an era when a black
-
and
- white approach isnt almost unheard of
.
( one important recent exception
, schindler
' s list
, eschewed colour forthe some of the same reasons that raging bull did
.
) in black
-
and
- white
( especially considering scorsese
' s choice of shots
and use of slow motion
)
, the violence is stark
and disturbing
. there
' s no room forthe romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas
. during fight sequences
, the director also uses a number of point
- of
- view shots designed to show thte world
,
however briefly
, fomr la motta
' s perspective
. scorsese could ahev choosen to end the film with la motta
' s loss to sugar ravy
, where he surrendered his middleweight crown
. after that
, his career was all downhill
.
yet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment
, stretching omre than a decade into la motta
' s future
. the reason is obvious
: scorsese isn
' t as interested in boxing as he is in the character
. following his retirement
, la motta is still as voilent
and volatile as ever
,
but he has lost the arena in which he can legally unleash those tendencies
. we see the results ofthe this beast let loose on society
and how the consequences of his actions reduce him to a parody of his former self
. who cannot feel a surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon br
ando
' s speech from onthe the waterfront
?
(
" i coulda been a contenda
.
"
) perhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the
' 80s
. anbd
, if not
, it
' s certainly perilously close to the zenith
.
