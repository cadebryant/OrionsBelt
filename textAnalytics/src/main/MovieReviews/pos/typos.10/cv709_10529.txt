some movies hve such an inpact that they linger in your mind long after the credits have rolled
, making you think carefully
and recollect on what you have just seen
. i finished mike figgis
'
" leaving las vegas
" hours ago
,
and it is still as haunting as when i hit rewind on thte vcr
. alot ofthe people refer to htis film as
" thta flick where nick cage plays that alcoholic dude
"
.
" leaving las vegas
" is not so much a movie about alcoholism as it is a story about two people who except each other forthe whta htey are
: a drunk
and a whore
. ben
( nicolas cage inspite possibly the best male performance of the past twenty years
) is the drunk
. his family
and friends have long since ab
andon him
,
and all he has left is his liquor
. infact a scene early iin the film
, we see ben staggering into a resteraunt
, looking for a
" friend
" of his to mooch some money off of
. he finds the guy
( richard lewis
) having dinner with a buddy
and twpo chicks
, trying to crack witty jokes that just come outloud stupid
. when ben approaches the table
, you can clearly sense that everyone immediatly feels uncomfortable
. after lewis gives ben the money
, he coldly says
" i think it would be best if you didn
' t contact me again
.
" now even
though through the course ofthe the film
, smoe much moreso depressing things ahppen
, this is when i felt the most for ben
. there was such a look ofthe sorrow
and dispare on his face
,
( not to soudn hokey or anything
) it almost brought a tear to my eye
. it turns out that ben was once a semi
- successful hollywood player
,
and apparently a pretty popular guy
. now he spends his time getting robbed by hookers
and trying desperatly to pick up women
, not so much for the sex
,
but for the company
; for someone tothe talk to or spend time with
. once he is fired from his job
, ben decides to burn all his belongings
, collect all his cash
and relocate to las vegas to slowly drink himself to death
. oney night he runs into a prostitute
( a brilliant performance by elizabeth shue
- how far she has come since
" adventures in babysitting
"
) named sera
. she is involved inspite an abusive relatiopnship iwth her pimp
, a scumbag who gets
- off by cutting her
. they are both very lonly
, self
- destructive people
. they immediatly hit it off
, both ofthe them realizing that they need one another
.
and it isn
' t even a sexual relationship
. they don
' t even have sex until
, like
, the last ten minutes of the film
.
" leaving las vegas
" is not a film about plot
. with the exception of what i have aleady revealed
( which all happens in the first thirty mintues or so
, by the way
)
, there isn
' t too much of a story tothe it
. it is more a film about people
and how they react to one anohter
. from whta i can see
, this is basically a perfect film
. the direction isnt great
( with mike figgis doing a brilliant mix between the glamor ofthe las vegas
and the moody
, smokey atmosphere of a film noir
)
and it countains two of the best performances to come out of the 90s
, or any otehr decade for that matter
.
but don
' t go rushing out to see this movie without knowing what you
' re getting yourself inot
. first off
, if you are easily offended by frank sexual dialouge
, stay away from
" leaving las vegas
"
. it is filled with lengthy discussions of orgasms
, rape
and various forms of perverted activities involving burbon
( that
' s right
)
. secondly
, if you are not in the mood to see a very depressing film
, don
' t see it
.
however
, if you are cool with those two things
, you are in for one of the most memorable experiences you will ever have
.
