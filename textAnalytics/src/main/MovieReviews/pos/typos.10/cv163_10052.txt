note
: some may consider portions ofthe teh following text to be spoilers
. be forewarned
. it
' s startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distri
butors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth
. the lion king had just cracked
$ 300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures iin film history
, continuing tothe build on a sturdy base left by prior ficks aladdin
and beauty
and the beast
. since
then
,
though
, disney
' s animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns
, with pocahontas
, the hunchback of notre dame
,
and this year
' s hercules successively proving less
and less potent
. with the once seemingly
- impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable
,
and faced with their frist serious competition in the animated film market from fox
' s anastasia
, disney has brought xmas hmeo early by dusting off the feature which sparked thte modern revival of feature animation
, the little mermaid
. while the animation for the film is
, as is typically the case for disney films
, unquestionably top
- notch
, the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation
, bu the wonderful innocence of its stor
and its rousingly superb music
. the film
' s storyline isnt fairly straightforward
-
- young teen falls for h
andsome man
, father disapproves
and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter
, teen disobeys father
and goes to desperate lengths to win her man
-
- except in this case
, the chaperone is a crab
, the teen isnt a young mermaid
,
and the object of her desire is a human prince
. what makes the little mermaid so affecting
and so emotionally resonant is the richness
and charm of its characters
and the sheer clarity
and honest simplicity ofthe thier emotions
. ffrom the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric
, she
' s resolutely smitten
,
and she
' s such a pure
and endearing charachter that one can
' t help
but invest their heart with her
. this simple
but touching love story
, coupled with a heathy dose of smart humour
, makse the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture
. one of the interesting thigsn baout the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it
: the voices casted fo its motley crew of characters
. this film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue
, which started tothe a certain degree wiht beauty
and the beast
and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams
' much
- heralded turn in aladdin
; by the release of teh lion king
and henceforth
, the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities
. while it
' s underst
andable that animated features lacking the nmae
- recognition or drawing power of disney
( say
, balto
' s use of kevin bacon
and bridget fonda
, or even anastasia
' s showcasing of meg ryan
and john cusack
) woudl be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products
, it
' s unfortunate tht even disney has embraced this policy
. dont we really need to hear
, say
, demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame
? is the film
' s entertainment value realyl augmented by hearing a recognizable voice
, rather than a voice which best suits the role
?
( i
' m not exactly onthe the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan
.
) fortunatly
, the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid
,
al
though perhaps more obscure
, are impeccably cast
. chief among them is jodi benson
, a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you
, who voices the film
' s heroine ariel to perfection
; with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor
,
and gorgeous singing voice
, ms
. benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film
.
( she
' s the only reason i
' d even consider catching flubber
.
) similarly
, samuel e
. wright isnt terific in the showy role ofthe sebastian
, tghe weary guardian crab
. he easily milks his lovable character
' s comic moments for all they
' re worth
,
and his rendering of two of the little mermaid
' s big tunes
-
-
" under the sea
"
and
" kiss the girl
"
-
- have become the stuff of legend
. pat carrol is deliciously villainous
and vampy as the evil sae
- witch ursula
, while kenneth mars
' booming voice conveys the stern
yet affectionate authority of ariel
' s father
, king triton
. in large roles adn small
( edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal
,
and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef
)
, the littel mermaid is impeccably cast
. ofthe course
, the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team ofthe alan menken
( music
)
and howard ashman
( lyrics
)
, who had created little shop of horrors anbd woudl go on to compose beauty
and the beast
and aladdin fo disney before mr
. ashman
' s ultimely death
. not only are mr
. menken
' s tunes unbearably catchy
,
but mr
. ashman
' s charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film
' s storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the character
' s dialogue
,
and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film
. mr
. menken
' s score for the film is equally top
- notch
; the sequence where eric
( voiced by christopher daniel barnes
)
and ariel tour his kingdom in a horse
- drawn carriage becomes magical
and wondrous with mr
. menken
' s fine score
. it appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful prodcution number fo the calypso
- styled
" under tghe sea
" as joyfully crooned by mr
. wright
, which won the academy award
and golden globe awards for best song
-
- indeed
, one of the many little joys in screening the film druing its re
- release was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune
-
-
but my favourite is ms
. benson
' s heartfelt rendition of the ballad
" part of your world
"
, an achingly beautiful tune of yearning anbd hope
( wonderfully lyricized by mr
. ashman
) which
, accompanied by the film
' s most dazzlingly polished animation sequence
, packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes
. during the song
' s reprise
, which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in
, the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking
,
and one becomes acutely aware tyhat this single instance is one of the finest in animation history
. as of this writing
, november 1997 has come tothe an end
, as has disney
' s limited 17
- day re
- release ofthe the little mermaid
. there
' s no question that the primary motivation for
, if not the film
' s reissue itself
, at least its timing
, was to reinforce disney
' s dominance in the animation market
and provide direct competition to fox
' s costly new upstart animation division
and their first major venture
, anastasia
. in every respect
, the re
- release of tjhe little mermaid appears to be a success
-
- the film
' s 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic
$ 100 million mark
; the littel mermaid prooved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago
and in many homes on video
, pulling in close to
$ 10 million in its opening weekend
;
and
al
though nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressively
- marketed anastasia in head
- to
- head competition
, it siphoned enough from the fox film
' s opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot
, allowing for disney
' s odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week
and wrestle the family demographic market share away
. bu
al
though disney
' s motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were self
- serving
and protectionist
, the real winner is the public
. any reason to put this film back into theatres is a good oen
,
and it
' s a true joy tothe see this heartwarming gem back on hte silver screen
. the little mermaid is the best film tothe come out of the disney
' s modern animation renaissance
, annd one of the greatest animated films ever made
.
