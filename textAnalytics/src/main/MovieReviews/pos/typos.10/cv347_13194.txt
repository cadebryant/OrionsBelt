. out of four film adaptations in as many years
, the witty
and inventive out of sight gives get shorty a run for its money as the best leonard adaptation around
. george clooney stars as jack foley
, a nice bank robber
.
.
. you konw the type
, he uses his charm
adn his wits rather than a gun
.
but even charming guys end up unlucky
,
and jack ends up in jail
.
but not for long
. he plots an escape with the help of his best friend
,
and fellow robber
, buddy bragg
( ving rhames

. s
. marshal karen sisco
( jennifer lopez
)
. appearing at the right place at the wrong time

.
however
, karen develops a rapport with jack foley
,
and finds thast she begrudgingly likes the guy
.
but
, can love prosper on oposite sides of the law
? or can karen straighten out jack before he goes too far in pursuit of just one last crime
. clooney
, who hasnt had a string of solid
,
but never stellar
, film roles
, delivers his best peformance to date
. he blends inot his role here perfectly as the risk taking jack foley
, who ' s willing to gamble everyting onthe the chance thast karen sisco might be his true love
. jennifer lopez does an excellent job as well
. she actually has a trickier role than clooney
, as a woman who hasnt to balance her emotions with her sense of duty
. she
and clooney develop good chemistry together
. the film boasts a superb ensemble
. steve zahn gives a hilarious performance
,
and steals nearly every scene he ' s in
. don cheadle is appropriately sinister as a violent ex
- con who may or may not be teaming up with foley
. albert brooks is enjoyable as a white collar criminal who talks too much for his own good
. out of the cast
, only dennis farina seems underused as karen ' s ex
- lawman father
. steven soderbergh gives the film sharp
adn stylistic direction
. iwth an affectation for freeze frames
, he delivers a unique take on the film ' s action
and love scenes that places out ofthe sight a notch above routine crime films
. a recurring series of flashbacks makes the film seem more complex than it actually is
. devoid of its bells
and whistles
, out of sight is actually a fairly straightforward crime story
.
however
, there are only a few spots in the film that seem bare
,
and they pass quickly
. with smart dialogue
, ogod characters
,
adn an excellent casted
, out of sight easily smoothes over the rough spots in the plot
and delivers on both hte action
and romantic fronts
.
