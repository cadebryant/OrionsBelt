harmless
, silly
and funn comedy about dim
- witted wrestling fans gordie
and sean
( david arquette
and scott caan
) who idolize current world championship wrestling heavyweight champion jimmy king
( oliver platt
)
. when king isnt screwed out of his title by a corrupt promoter
( joe pantoliano
)
, gordie
and sean take it upon themselves to find their fallen hero
and restore his glory
. my biggest fear about ready to rumble wass despatched early on
, as thge filmmakers are quick to show that wresting is indeed choreographed
(
but not fake
, mind you
)
. teh hook of tyhe movei is that gordie
and sean are just too stupid to relize that
. arquette
and caan are suitably over the top with their performances
, which is exactly what a movie like tihs requires
, anbd oliver platt
( one ofthe my favorite actors
) is a riot as the drunken washed
- up ex
- champion
. many have scoffed at the idea that platt should be playing a heavyweight champion wrestler iwth an unbeaten record
,
but for me it just added to yhe
" silly factor
" of the film
, thereby increasing my enjoyment of it
. one casting complaint
however
: rose mcgowan as a sexy dancer
? please
.
.
. if rose mcgowan is sexy thne i
' m marilyn manson
. given the current state of the actual wcw
, if oliver platt were appearing as jimmy king right now on wcw programming
, he
' d be the most populare guy they have
. on a similar note
, the
" plot line
" of the wresting portions of the film are more entertaining than anything the wcw writers hve been able to come up with in the last two years
. altough one doesnt have to ask
.
.
. why would any wrestling promoter fire the head wrestler of a company who is both unbeaten
and extremely popular with the fans
? director brian robbins
( you
' ll remember him as eric from tv
' s
" head of the class
"
) just knows how to make good dumb movies
. this movie fits in nicely with his previous efforts good burger
and varsity blues
.
and screenwriter steven brill
( teh epic mighty ducks trilogy
, late last night
) manages to keep things both sophomoric
and clever at the smae timne
, wiht almost all the jokes of the film getting a laugh out of me
. the only exceptions to that were
: 1
) a scene involving a van full of singing nuns
and 2
) any scene involving the old woman wrestling fan
. those moments made me cringe
and
/ or groan
. as an added bonus
though
, the audience is treated to outtakes from the film as the final credits roll
.
