. star wars is an amazing epic
. the plot is so original
and amazing
, i cannot believe it
. the special effects
, especially for its time
, are wonderful
and realistic
. the space scenes in particular are the most funn to watch
. the ships flown by all are very unique
and creative
. the costumes are also out ofthe this world
. the scenery is so different ffrom anything i have ever seen before
. there are a variety of different very memorable set pieces that will stay with me forever
. the entire premise of star wars is amazing
. teh creatures
and droids that we see throughtout the film are one of a kind
. even the human characters are differnt
. every character is extremely likable
and different from characters fomr other sci fi films
. tje acting on everyone ' s part is great
, especially that of sir alec guinness ' s
. even
though the concept is not realistic at all
, it isnt pulled off very nicely
. the acting
, setting
, effects
, costumes
,
and sound make it work
. if any of theese were messed uv
, star wars would have come off as one huge joke
. the ending works very well
,
adn left it very open to the sequels that came afterward
. in early 1997
, a special edition of star wars was released
. the film wass re
- mastered so it looked better than it did in 1977
. a few creatures weere added here
and there
,
and even an entire deleted scene with han solo
and jabba tyhe hutt
( seen in return of the jedi
) was added tothe the film
. think that ' s enough
? on may 19
, 1999
, star wars episode i
: the phantom menace will be released
, followed by two more films that will reveal whta went onthe before a new hope
. with this
, star wars is bound tothe become the greatest tale told in our time
