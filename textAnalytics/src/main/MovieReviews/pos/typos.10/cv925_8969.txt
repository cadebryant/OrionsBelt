contact is a film that tries to do severeal different things
. it is intended to preent a realsitic picture of what alien contact might be like
, to restore a sense of wonder
and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life
, to raise questions about science
and faith
and how they would be relevant in such a situation
,
and to tell a personel story of a romance between the astronomer dr
. ellie arroway
( jodie foster
)
and the religious spokesman palmer joss
( matthew mcconaughey
)
. the film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals
. the portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable
( albeit less immediately engaging
) than
, sday
, the cold
- blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions
and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv
' s the x
- files
. the aliens inspite contact seem to be like us
- they are more curious than anything else
. they know we exist
, they want us to know that htey exist
,
and they would like to make the next step
and communicate inthe person
. the film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens direcly
,
and between the characters
' ongoing speculation baout the extraterrestrials
and the outst
anding visuals in the climactic
yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on hte alien world
, that sense of wonder
and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen usance stanley kubrick
' s 2001
: a space odessy
. most of the film
,
however
, takes place on earth
, where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to theese aliens
. scientists are enthusiastic
, ultraconservative religeous leaders are wary
,
and government officials are caught somewhere in between
. the debate is fueled largely by dr
. arroway
' s atheism
; she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints
,
but many are wary ofthe sending an atheist as humankind
' s representative to another species
. the film is partly successful in raising
and exploring these questions
, especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches
- science
and faith
- could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed
. still
, the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society
. the two
" sides
" are represented primarily by arroway
and by far
- right fundamentalists
,
but in reality probably 80
% ofthe americans are neither atheists nor far
- right fundamentalists
. palmer joss occupies something of a middle ground
,
but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives
and comes across as a less
- tahn
- ideal spokesman for any ideology
.
then agina
, the film doens concentrate mostly on public debate
, which does
, after all
, tend to be dominated by extremists
, rather than on dinner
- tabel or college
- dormitory discussions
. contact isnt accurate in its portrayal of these issues
,
then
,
but onyl within the narrow scope to which it confines itself
. the film
' s one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway
and joss
. for one thing
, it resorts to the tired movie clich
* tht two attractive people wiull immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen toghether
, as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction
. the romance rarely
, if ever
, sheds any light on the characters
,
al
though it occasionally tries
and fails
- joss
' s explaination that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement
(
" i guess you could say i
' m a man of the cloth
,
but without the cloth
"
)
, for example
, is more like a punchline to a joke than character development
. instead
, the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments
. granted
, this is a plot
-
and idea
- driven film
and the characters are secondary
,
but this just seemed like laziness on the writers
' part more than anything else
. the successes of contact
,
however
, far outweigh its failures
. even if the social commentary had fizzled alltogether
( which it didn
' t
)
, the simple
yet mysterious story of aline communication still owudl have made it a memorable film
. contact doesn
' t quite cover all the bases
,
but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a two
- hour film
,
and its rejection of big
- budget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable
.
and i would not be surprised if
, ten years from now
, contact is maintioned in the same breath as 2001
and blade runner as one of the finest examples ofthe sophisticated
and intellectually relevant science fiction
.
