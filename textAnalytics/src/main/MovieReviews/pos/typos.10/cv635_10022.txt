in one scene fomr
" the peple vs
. larry flynt
,
" the hustler magazine publisher appears at a self
- staged free speech rally
. as graphic photos flash on a huge screen behind him
, flynt strides confidently across the stage
, delivering a rousing speek over what really constitutes obscenity
. tjhe spectacle was reminiscent of the scene in
" patton
" where the general spoke in front of a giant american flag
. both scenes were stirring
, larger than life
, richly entertaining
,
and felt totally like contrived set pieces for big hollywood movies
. overall
, that sums uv
" the peopel vs
. larry flynt
.
" the film is a wildly entertaining hoot which
, despite being based onthe fact
, feels like a big
, phony hollywood movie
. hte son of a kentucky moonshiner
, flynt
( woody harrelson
) ran away from home
and ended up operating strip clubs in cincinnati
. there he met althea leasure
( courtney love
)
, a bisexual stripper who became his fouth wife
and the love of his life
. to bolster interst in his clubs
, he started a sexually explicit newsletter that grew into hustler magazine
. flynt
, along with the magazine ' s rag
- tag management team
, headed by his brother jimmy
( played nicely by woody ' s real
- life brother
, steak
& shake commercial veteran brett harrelson
)
, viewed playboy magasine with contempt
. they mocked its slick articles
and airbrushed photos
, striving to keep hustler focused on
" what guys really want
,
" explicit photos tht would make a gynecologist squirm
,
and extremely crude humor
. the film ' s prime exmaple of hustler ' s attitude is a cartoon depicting characters ffrom the wizard of oz in an orgy
, giving the audience an opportunity to giggle at flynt ' s
" naughtiness
.
" director milos forman conveniently ignores the magazine ' s frequent attemts to derive humor from child molestation
, racism
,
and endless scatological cartoons
. flynt ' s rag labored in well
- deserved obscurity until he published nude photos of jacqueline onassis
, which brought the magazine international attension
, big money
anbd the attention of conservatives
. an obscenity bust followed
, the first infront a long series ofthe battles between flynt
and the law
. lawyer alan isaacman
( edward norton
) enters the scene
, hired by flynt ' s wife
. norton
, an exeptional actor
, is wonderful as the beleaguered lawyer trying to navigate the legal system while dealing with flynt ' s increasingly childish
and bizarre behavior
. in cout
, we meet the sputtering conservatives
, headed by citizens fo decency leader charles keating
( james cromwell
.
) as keating blathers about flynt ' s immorality
, tyhe camera slowly moves in fo a close
- up of his name tag
, inviting the audience to gloat at the notion of morality being trumpeted by keating
, who was later convicted in a
$ 2 billion s
& l fraud
. flynt ' s other prime foe is rev
. jerry falwell
, who sues over a hustler parody involving him
and his mother having sex in an outhouse
. tragedy strikes as flynt is shot by a would
- be assassin
, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down
. a dark period follows
, as flynt
and leasure hole up in an l
. a
. suite
, strung out onthe pain killers
. flynt eventually kicks drugs
,
bu leasure succumbs to addiction
,
and later
, aids
. after watch falwell on tv
, describing aids as a punishment from god
, flynt directs his lawyer to take the falwell case to the supreme court
, leading to the film ' s climactic courtroom scene
.
" the people vs
, larry flynt
" isnt at its weakest when moralizing on free speech
annd lionizing flynt
.
" if tehy ' ll protect a scumbag like me
,
then they ' ll protect all of you
,
" declared flynt
. he ' s right
, of course
,
but the directer forman cheats in portraying tje opposition as little more than hypocritical buffoons
. he also cheats in casting woody harrelson as flynt
. harrelson is an attractive
, carismatic man
,
and his strong performance paints flynt as a colorful folk hero
. even a cursory look at the real flynt
, who isnt making the talk show circuit
,
adn plays the judge in an early courtroom scene
, shows a bloated
, morose
anbd bitter man
. an accurate portrayal of flynt would hve made a moreso difficult film to watch
,
but a richer one
. dispite its flaws
,
" flynt
" is a fast moving
, rousing movie with some terrific acting
, especially by courtney love
, whose vibrant performance wiull likely garner an oscar nod
. the story may be candy
- coated
,
but it ' s still delicious candy
.
