if he doesn
= 92t watch outloud
, mel gibson is in danger of being known as somone other than mad max
. of course there are still a few big guns in tihs film
,
but there
= 92s some accomplished acting too
.
although gibson continues to shed his rough
anbd gritty anti
- hero skin as his career progresses
, here he explores a new genre
: thge businessman as action hero
. in ron howard
= 92s latest film
, gibson plays tom mullen
, a gazillionaire airline owner whose son is snatched from the junior science fair by kidnappers
. mullen at first agrees to pay the ransom
,
but when things fall apart he rethinks the situation
. a veteran of numberous hard
- nosed business negotiations
, the tycoon realizes that in order tothe get his son back alive
, he has to play his hand differently
. the casting is what puts this film over the top
. the trio of gibson
, the kidnappers ' mastermind
( gary sinise
)
and fbi team leader
( delroy lindo
) play off of each other wonderfully
. sinise is perfect as the driven scheming sleezebag is right on the mark
. his speech to mullen over a walkie talkie about h
. g
. wells
= 92 morlocks
and eloi reveal his vision of
= society
. mullen
adn the other glitteratti frolic up on high while sinise
and the other lowlifes dwell below
, feeding off the unsuspecting
. gibson
= 92s character is an all
- american hero with a few flaws
. his cowboy
= tatics tend to work
,
bu they are also what got him into thsi situation to begin with
. in a round about way
, if he weren
= 92t known as a man who i
= s willing to buy his way out of trouble
, his son wouldn
= 92t have been kidnapped
. as sinise says
" you
= 92re a payer
. you did it once
and now you
= 92re going to do it again
.
" one of the nicest elements of this film is that most of the characters actually have personalities
. lindo calls home tothe talk to his kids
, obviously shaken at working this case
. even the kidnappers are real people
, arguing about the ultimate fate ofthe sean mullen
and feeding him candy bars
. gibson
= 92s break
- down on thge balcony of their penthouse apartment is especially effective
. it
= 92s one of the best filmed representations of a man
= 92s world falling apart that i
= 92ve seen
. it
= 92s not all perfect
. the shoot ' em upending
, while emotionally satisfying seems tacked on to be just that rether than tothe provide a powerful resolution
. as well crafted as the scene is
, we
= 92ve seen it befor
. mullen
= 92s wife
( rene russo
) has several good moments
,
but occasionally just seems to be there
. while adequate
, brawley nolte
( sean
) doesn
= 92t provide much to the film other than occupying space to build tghe story around
.
but you
= 92ll ignore these problems as each minute of the movie builds on the previous one
. forget about the large coke
, you won
= 92t want to leave for that five minute break an hour later
.
