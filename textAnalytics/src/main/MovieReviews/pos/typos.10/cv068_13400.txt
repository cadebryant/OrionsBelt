hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death
( no pun intended
- honest
)
. it
' s a shame
, too
, because the good count wass probably hte most frightening out yhe old b
- movie monsters
. i mean
, come on
. are people realyl going to get that scared over a big green guy named frankenstein that moves at a speed of five miles per hour
? hell no
.
and not only was the idea of a vampire frightening as hell
,
but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well
, not commonly associated with horror films
.
and not only has the idea been done too many times
,
but withthe the possible exception of from dusk
' till dawn
, hasnt not been done very well lately
, either
. thsi is precisely why it was so much fun for me watching the original nosferatu
. i got to go back tothe the times when making movies
( even horror movies
) was considered an art form
,
and not just done to make cash like nowadays
.
and that is exactly what this film is
; art
. i
' ve been a horror fan since i was eight years old
,
and to this day i have not seen any horror film cover the intellectual ground that this film covers
. let me backtrack a minute
. when i say
" intellectual ground
"
, i don
' t mean that nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that
, i just mean that in order for the film to wokr the way it was intended to
, a little bit ofthe thinking is involved
. with most modern slasher movies like friday the 13th
and what
- not
, yuo can just simply sit back in your chair
and be frightened by the gore that is shown
. thsoe movies could have been made by a fifth grader with a good makeup kit
; movies like this require the viewer to actually pay attention
and ponder what is happening on the screen
. you see
, this movie has barely any violence in it
and even less blood or gore
. this is a thikning man
' s slasher flick
. the
" nosferatu
" of the title isnt orlock
( max shreck
)
, a stange
, hermit
- like count that
, as the film opens
, is looking for a new home to buy
. he imploys the help of hutter
( gustav von wangenhein
)
, a real estate salesman
( or something to that effect
) who has a nice home
and even a fiancee named ellen
( greta schroeder
)
. upon orders from his boss
, hutter treks to the transylvanian montains tothe visit orlock
' s castle
and speak to him about his new home
( which just happens tothe be right next door to hutter
' s
)
. the enxt morning
, he wakes up to find teeth marks on his neck
.
.
. not really a good sign
. he
then discovers thru some reading that the count is a
" nosferatu
"
, or vampire
, one of yhe undead that feeds off the blood ofthe living humans
.
but by the time he pieces this together
, he is too late
; orlock has already embarked to hutter
' s hometown via boat
. will hutter reach his destination in time to save his fiancee from the deadly clutches of count orlock
? the character of orlock is
, of course
, dracula
. the only only reason his name was changed was because this was an unauthorized account ofthe bram strocker
' s novel
. just
thought that was an interesting little side note
.
.
. probably the only way you will get to see this fine film is by puchasing a copy of arrow enteratinment
' s digitally restored cut
, now available in stores
.
however
, this version is quite different than maunau
' s original masterpiece
. the movie is now sporting a new soundtrack by b
and type o
- negitive
and color tinting
, much liuke the 1984 version of lang
' s metropolis
. now
, i really appreciate whta arrow enteratinment isnt trying to dont here
, bringing a classic like thsi to the attention of a wider audience that might have otherwise just skipped this one
.
but alas
, i like watching movies the way they were originally intended to be seen
.
but that
' s jsut my bag
; you may like the newer
, more
" modern
" version better
. either way
, i suggest investing your money iin a copy
. if you like what they have done with it
, pop it in the vcr
and enjoy
. if you
' re liek me
, just do what i
' ll do during future viewings
; turn the colour all the way down on your television
, hit mute
, turn onthe soem bach or mozart or whatever
, dim the lights
and prepare to view what is truley one of the greatest films ever made
.
