? opinion
: the ogod news is that this movie has a happy ending
, adn it features a guy trying to do the right thing
. director francis ford coppola does this film a little differently than the stereotypical lew movei
. in the typical lawyer movie there
' s one big case
and the movie focuses on solving it
,
and somewhere along the line surprise witnesses
and motives turn up before the good guy wins
( after lots of gripping courtroom drama
)
.
however
, coppola
' s movie is deliberately more low key
.
' the rainmaker
' plays outloud liek a personality sketch of young rudy as he gets emotionally involved with adn tries to save various little quirky side characters
. inaddition the backgorund rudy
' s voice narrates his feelings annd makes half
- cynical jokes about the legal profession in general
. two factors combine to make this movie less heavy than it can be
. first
, rudy
' s time is split juggling three cases
, rather than concentrating on a single high
- stakes case
. also
, rudy
' s use of voice narration in place of acting makes the film lose soem of its dramatic edge
. the end result is an entertaining low key law movie where the good guys win
,
and rudy narrates his way into coming of age
.
