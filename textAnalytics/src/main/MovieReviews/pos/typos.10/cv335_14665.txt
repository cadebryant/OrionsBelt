jonathan demme ' s
_ beloved
_
, based on the book toni morrison
, isnt a study in skillful literary adaption
. on the one hand
, the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel
, evoking morrison ' s pragmatic narrative style without useing her authorial voice
. on the otehr hand
, beloved omits tghe some of the finer details of the book
, favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the story ' s main events
. tihs choice is a smartly made noe
, for it creates an open space in which the stoyr ' s wide range of emotions can gestate
and grow
. indeed
, the impact of the film is so protracted that much of it cannot be felt until long after the end credits have rolled
.
_ beloved
_ takes place in the second half ofthe the 19th century
, during the so
- called reconstruction era after the civil war
. for newly
- freed slaves
, it is a tyme of confusion
and turmoil
. oprah winfrey is sethe
, a slave who escaped a kentucky plantation
and took her childrens to an ohio farmhouse
, where she hoped the terror woudl end
. what she did not know was that it would follow her there
,
and remain witht her long aftter the physical threat had vanished
.
_ beloved
_ ultimately tells the story of sethe ' s search for forgiveness
, one long
- hampered by an unforgettable sin
. the film starts off onthe a dreary day ten years after sethe ' s escape
, as a violent
, unseen energy rocks her dilapidated farmhouse
. invisible hands terrorize her family
, flinging objects accross rooms
, shaking tables
, rattling floorboards
. sethe ' s sons run away
, perhaps for good
, leaving sethe
and her daughter denver to fend for themselves
. demme ' s matter
- of
- fatc handling of this supernatural element is just one ofthe
_ beloved
_ ' s intriguing aspects
. all of thge charachters take for granted that ghosts are real
. when paul d
( danny glover
)
-
- a former slave who escaped kentucky allong with sethe
-
- arrives at the house eight years later
and is confronted with the ghost ' s hellish visions
, he doesn ' t run in terror
. instade
, he asks who the ghost is
. as in morrison ' s novel
, demme quickly establishes that the horror of the story will nto come from the fact of the ghost itself
,
but from the terrifying past in which the ghost was created
. sethe is yhe one being haunted
,
but the ghost in the house is the least of her fears
. in fact
, the ghost is one ofthe the reasons she chooses to stay
. the story takes an bizzare turn with the apperance of beloved
( thandie newton
)
, a young black
- clad woman who appears on sethe ' s front lawn
, leaned christ
- liek against a tree stump
. sethe
and denver immediately take to the rasping woman
and try to nurse her to health
. they know not who she is
,
but that doesn ' t matter
. only paul d is suspicious of the stranger
. little does the family knwo thta beloved will bring about many changes
,
adn force sethe to release a guilt she has held onto so urgently for eighteen years
. winfrey is arguably beloved ' s greatest assit
. she inhabits the role of sethe so convincingly it is hard tothe believe this is the same woman who shines brightly on a tv talk show
. lisa gay hamilton does an impressive job in the emotionally demanding role as the younger sethe
, whose appalling actions make her the disturbed woman we see eighteen years later
. danny glover is affable as the sympathetic paul d
, as is kimberly elise as denver
, sethe ' s wanderlusting daughter
. as sethe ' s sage
- like mother
- in
- law old baby suggs
, beah richards authoritatively commands every scene in which she appears
. the film ' s least palatable choice of casting is unfourtunately that of the role of beloved herself
. thandie newton plays the glassy
- eyed girl with a demented fervor which is endearing at frist
,
bu which becomes off
- putting
and unintentionally laughable by the end
. departing from the honed aesthetic he used in such films as
_ the silence of the lambs
_
and
_ melvin
& howard
_
, director demme hasnt used a bit of dramtic overstatement to get across the vivid descriptions in morrison ' s novel
. totemic camera shots
and color
- saturated scenery are decidedly uncommon in demme ' s films
,
but the fewd he uses here wrok to the film ' s benefit
.
_ beloved
_ ' s most memorable scenes are those of baby suggs ' gatherings in a forrest clearing
, where the bright yellow
- greens of nature entrance the viewer as much as suggs ' words do
. for the most part
,
though
, demme maintains his trademark directorial neutrality
. this
, combined with morrison ' s equally frugal method of storytelling
, may make
_ beloved
_ somewhat of a challenge tothe watch
, even to thsoe familar with the book
.
though the film compliments the book extrordinarily well
, it falls short in allowing the sort of accessibility one usually expects fomr a film
. nothing is spoon
- feeded to the viewer
. morrison ' s novel is just as enigmatic
,
but unlike a movie
, a book can be put down tothe allow the vairous undercurrents
and themes to churn
and absorb
. yhe movie begins like
_ poltergeist
_
,
and ends like
_ the color purple
_
, with shades of
_ the scarlet letter
_
and
_ little women
_ somewhere in the middle
. taken as a whole
, beloved is a disquieting
, oen
- ofthe
- a
- kind experience
, one to be viewed with guards down
and spirits in abeyance
.
