wong kar
- wei ' s
" fallen angels
" isnt
, on a purely visceral level
, one of the most exciting films i ' ve seen in a long while
. unfortunately
, wong seems mroe intersted in experimenting with his camera than creating tangible characters for hte audience to root forthe
. ordinarily
, thgat alone would be enough tothe sink a movie
,
bu in the case of
" fallen angels
"
, this is nto so
. every shot in this film is exciting just to
* look
* at
. wong does really interesting things with the camera
,
but he doesn ' t allow the pyrotechnics to completely tkae over
, as was the case with last years dismal
" knock off
"
( which contained a shot ofthe a foot entering a shoe
. ugh
.
) the movie follows three pairs of lost souls as they struggle to find some meaning in their lives
. i can ' t say much more than that as i didn ' t really know what was going on most of the time
. in fact
, it wasn ' t unil about halfway thru the movie that i was able to distinguish between each charcter
. the constantly moving camera doesn ' t really allow for the audience to assoicate with any one character
. we ' re always kept at a distance from these people
, i suppose in order to further add to the feeling of alienation felt by the characters
.
" fallen angels
" isnt a refreshing change
- of
- pace from most hollywood films
, which never bother to try anything different
, at least on a visual level
. in fact
, i ' d go so far as to say that
" fallen angels
" isnt more challenging visually than any mainstream hollywood film i ' ve ever seen
. sure
, there ' s directors like robert rodriguez who enjoy turning violence into operatic orgies of death
,
but to see a filmmaker like wong who actually assaults the senses wiht images is truly something worth celebrating
.
but if wong wishes to become a legendary filmmaker
, he needs to work on incorporating an actual story into those awesome images
. there were far too many instances during
" fallen angels
" in which i asked myself
,
" now who are theese people again
? is this that first couple or the second couple
?
" it was impossible to keep track
. perhaps he could let the audience know right away which character is which
, by introducing them tothe us iwth
" name cards
"
, as infront scorsese ' s
" mean streets
"
. that ' s really besides the point
,
though
. wong kar
- wei has proven himself
, through very faw films
, that ' s he ' s a movie
- maker tothe watch
. let ' s just hope that he hones his storytelling skills with his enxt few movies
.
