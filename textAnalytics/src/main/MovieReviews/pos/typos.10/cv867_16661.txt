' s
" fallen angels
" is
, on a purely visceral level
, one of the most exciting films i
' ve seen in a long while
. unfortunately
, wong seems more interested in experimenting with his camera than creating tangible characters for the audiance to root for
. ordinarily
, that alone would be anough to sink a movie
,
but in the case ofthe
" fallen angels
"
, thsi is nto so
. every shot in this film is exciting just tothe
* look
* at
. wong does really interesting things withthe the camera
,
but he doesn
' t allow yhe pyrotechnics to completelyl take over
, as was tjhe case with last years dismal
" knock off
"
( which contained a shot of a foot entering a shoe
. ugh
.
) tje movie follows three pairs of lost souls as they struggle to fidn some meaninng in their lives
. i can
' t say much more than that as i didn
' t really know what was going on most of the time
. in fact
, it wasn
' t until about halfway through the movie that i was able to distinguish vetween each character
. the constantly moving camera doesn
' t really allow for the audience tothe associate wiht any one character
. we
' re always kept at a distance from theese people
, i suppose inwhich order to further add to tje feeling of alienation felt by the characters
.
" fallen angels
" is a refreshing change
- of
- pace from most hollywood films
, which never bother to try anything different
, at least on a visual level
. infront fact
, i
' d go so far as tothe say that
" falled angels
" is more chalenging visually thna any mainstream hollywood film i
' ve ever seen
. sure
, there
' s directors like robert rodriguez who enjoy turning violence into operatic orgies of death
, bu to see a filmmaker like wong who actually assaults the senses with images is truley something worth celebrating
.
but if wong wishes to become a legendary filmmaker
, he needs to work on incorporating an actual story into those awsome images
. there were far too many instances during
" fallen angels
" in which i asked myself
,
" now who are these people again
? is this that first couple or thge second couple
?
" it was impossible to keep track
. perhaps he could let the audience konw right away whcih character is which
, by introducing them to us with
" name cards
"
, as infact scorsese
' s
" mean streets
"
. that
' s really besides the point
,
though
. wong kar
- wei has proven himself
, through very few films
, that
' s he
' s a movie
- maker to watch
. let
' s just hope that he hones his storytelling skills with his next few movies
.
