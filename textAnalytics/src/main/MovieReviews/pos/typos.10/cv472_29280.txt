jay
and silent bob strike back cin rightfully be subtitled
" kevin smith ' s greatest hits
" for the film is comprised of numerous references
and characters ffrom smith ' s earlier works including
, clerks
, mall rats
. chasing amy
and dogma
. so
, be advised
: bone uv on that cinematic quartet in order to achieve the maximum enjoyment from smith ' s latest outing
. kevin smith must be a very likable person because several ogod sports took a ton of kidding in this feature
, most notably miramax
, the studio whose subsidiary
, dimention films
, is jay
and silent bob ' s distributor
. others deserving accolades include ben affleck
, matt damon
, directors gus van zant
and wes craven
and the mighty george lucas
. this is a laugh
- filled
, foul
- mouthed road film with jay
( jason mewes
)
and silent bob
( smith
) hitching to hollywood to sabotage miramax ' s production of bluntman
and chronic
, comic book characters based on the two jersey slackers
. jay ' s convoluted reasoning is that if the film is shut down
, people onthe the internet will stop insulting him
and bob
, even
though it is not him
and bob the peopel are dissing
,
but rather their comic book counterparts
. no marter
, the duo beign their long trek hitching rides across the country
.
but first they git some tips ffrom a veteran hitchhiker
, played by george carlin
, who tells them to folow
" the book
"
- the rules of the road
. of course jay ' s interpretation immediately gets the duo in trouble witht a friendly nun
( carrie fisher
) who offers them a ride
. jay
and silent bob contains enough laughs that the movie ' s weaker aspects
- which include a lame subplot about a girl gang of diamond thieves as well as a buffoonish federal park ranger played by will ferrell
- can be easily tolerated
. really
, how can you not laugh at a film in which our heroes are picked up by the mystery van
,
and jay has a pot
- induced hallucination concerning velma
and daphne
. the movie ' s highlight
,
though
, is near the finale
. in hollywood
, jay
and silent bob sneak onto the miramax lot where they crash the set
and are mistaken fo extras of the latest affleck
- damon picture
, good will hunting 2
: hunting season
. here we are privy to a hillarious conversation between affleck
and damon in which the two put down each other ' s careers
and film choices
.
and the laughs continue to grow
. next up is jason
( american pie
) biggs
and james
( dawson ' s creek
) van der beek
, the actors chosen to portray bluntman
and chronic
. the pair mistake jay
and silent bob for their stunt doubles
. fianlly
, comes a star wars homage featuring one of the stars of thast legendary feature
. this bit will leave you howling
. smith ' s obvious affection for pop culture icons is evident in the way he shoots these scenes
and handles his performers
. he allows them to play it all tongue
- in
- cheek
. theri fun comes through the screen to the audience
. it is too bad that this is jay
adn silent bob ' s swan song
. the characters have grown since their supporting role debuts in clerks
.
but smith realizes that times have changed
,
and he doesn ' t want his creations to overstay their welcome
. so smith has provided them with just the right kind of exit
, saving the best for last
. goodbye jay
and silent bob
. at least you ' re gonig out with a blast
.
