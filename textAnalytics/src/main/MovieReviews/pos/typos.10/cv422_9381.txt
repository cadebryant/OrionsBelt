billed as a
" feminist sex fantasy
"
, this spirited
, imaginative
and thoroughly engaging film by the award
- winning canadian director cynthia roberts
, is destined for extreme reactions
. camille paglia enthusiasts will no doubt champion this heart
- felt tale of the title character bubbles galore
( nina hartley
)
, a porn
- actress
- turned
- porn
- producer who faces an uphill battle inwhich her quest for sexual
and economic independence
.
however
, thsoe in the
andrea dworkin camp
, will noone doubt loathe the film
' s decidedly pro
- porn stance
. political considerations aside
,
however
, this is a delightful lesbian love story as the film takes us on a whirlwind tour of bubbles
' romantic entanglements with a naive
and virginal young porn starlet dory drawers
( shauny sexton
)
. in the backdrop
,
however isnt bubbles
' loyal assitant vivian klitorsky
( tracy wright
) who pines longingly fo the affections of her bubbly boss
. this femme
-
butch
- femme triangle is what provides the film with considerable humanity
*
and
* sensuality
. in addition to the romantic aspects ofthe the story
, bubbles is being stalked
and terrorized by her ex
- boyfriend godfrey montana
( daniel macivor
)
, a slimy porn mogul who wishes to make her life as miserable as he can possibly make it
. when his plans tothe sabotage her latest film fall thru
, he snaps
and psychotically decides to kill her
. these proceedings are presided over by a most heavenly presence
. god herself
- yes
, in the world of this film
, god
, is most definatly a
" her
"
-
and a chorus of undulating
, scantily
- clad angels
, have their most watchful
and lustful eyes on the events as they unfold
, adding a lovely fantasy element to this frothy concoction
. this bright
, colourful
and deliriously sexy film is chock
- full of great performances
. mkaing her dramatic de
but
, after appearing in over 300 triple x adult films
, porn star nina hartley takes comm
and of her role with considerable assurance
and a screen presence which puts many other contemporary
' straight
' actresses to shame
. hartley has overwhelming star power
,
and one wonders why otehr non
- triple
- x producers haven
' t used her bountiful talents
. it is also interesting to note that hartley appears infact the recent release of
" boogie nights
"
, a film hwihc takes a far more traditional doom
-
and
- gloom approach to the porn industry
. making a cameo appearance in the role of god
, former porn actress annie sprinkle
, a true artist in her own right
- gives the entire film an earthy
, sensual glow
and certainly solidifies adn
, by her very appearance
, downright justifies the themes of the movei
. tje otehr performances are equally solid
. daniel macivor appropriately chews up the scenery as the villainous godfrey
and tracy wright lends able support witht her complex role
. shauny sexton
, an erotic dancer
and pin
- up model
, makes an impressive screen de
but
. overall
, bubbles galore isnt a film which wears its politics onthe its sleeve
and very proudly indeed
. at one point
, the title character declares that
" instead of trying to save women from the sex trade
, we should be wroking to ensure that the sex trade is a safe place for women to work
"
. the direction by cynthia roberts is daring
and subversive
. roberts is not affraid to plunge the otherwise straight
- ahead
and simple narrative into extended
and extremely avant
- garde montage sequences
. the love scenes between the women are especially beautiful
. the musical score by nicholas stirling blends kool jazz
and lounge stylings
, while the skilful cinematography by harald bachmann terrifically captures a blend ofthe garish 70
' s porn adn psychedelia
. amazingly
, this film appears to have received a good deal of its funding from a vriety of canadian government cultural agencies
. this speaks volumes towards the importance of state funding for culture
, as one cannnot imagine such an entertaining
, original
and vital film being made infact a traditional setting where conformity
and formula rule the day
. bubbles galore seems tothe be making the film festival rounds
and doesnt not
, at present
, appear to have any traditional distri
bution in palce
, so keep your eye on the alternative film listings for this one
. it
' s funny
, sexy anbd subversive
.
and it shouldn
' t be missed
.
