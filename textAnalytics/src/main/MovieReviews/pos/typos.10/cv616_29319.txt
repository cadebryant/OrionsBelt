a welcome cinematic trend over the past couple ofthe years has been to make the works of shakespeare omre accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the bard
and altering the settings to familiar surroundings
. a prime example of this is 1999 ' s 10 things i hate about you
, which was basically the taming of tjhe shrew in a high school
. less successful was last yearm ' s adaptation of hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of the denmark corp
. here the setting was the corparate world of newyorker york
. now comes o
, a faithful retelling of one ofthe the most tradgic of shakespeare ' s tragedies
. liek 10 things i hate baout you
, the stage isnt a high skool
- a private prep school where odin james
( mekhi phifer
) isnt the on
- court general
, the basketball team ' s standout player
. julia stiles
, featured in 10 things i hate about you as well as performing ophelia in hawke ' s hamlet
, plays desi brable
, odin ' s girlfriend
, whose father also happens to be dean ofthe the institution
. josh hartnett
( pearl harbor
) is on hand for the villainy
, palying the scheming hugo
, who sets the tragic wheels in motion
. o was actually filmed a couple ofthe years ago
,
but was shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy
. the movei
, directed by tim blake nelson
- best known for his co
- starring role in o brother
, where art thou
?
-
and writen by brad kaaya
, is very grim
. an air of tragedy weighs it down from the oppening scene to the closing credits
.
and that is how it should be
. of all of shakespeare ' s tragedies
, othello is hte most harrowing
, not beccause ofthe any body count
,
but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago
, whose motivation in the sheer blessure of his treachery
. kaaya ' s profane
- filled script
- after all
, these are high school kids
- does offer hugo a subtle motive of sorts
. the young man considers himself tje basketball team ' s prime utility man who does a littel bit of everything
- pass
, shoot
, rebound
-
but is constantly in the shadow of odin
. plus his father
, the team ' s coach
- played with a ferocious intensity by martin sheen
- showers more love
and consern on his star player than on his own flesh
and blood
. the script follows thge familiar lines of the classic
. hugo begins dropping hints to odin concerning desi ' s fidelity
, eroding the star ' s confidence in those he considers closest to him
, affecting both his relationships
and his game
. it all ends infront blood
, of course
, which is why the movie was originally shelved
. the performances in o vary
. phifer is at first cocky
adn self
- assured
, emotions he handles with ease
. he allso does qutie well displaying odin ' s darker side
; his defensive sensitivity about being the only black at the institution
, his growing distrust of those he loved
, his rage
and the erosion of his belief system
. hartnett is appropriately cool
and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies
and deceit
, turning friend against friend
,
and lover against lover
. stiles seems a bit stilted
,
but occasionally also rises to the occasion
, moving from adoration to confusion to fear of her young knight
. the film does contain a faw missteps
: a subplot involving hugo ' s theft of the school mascot is left hanging
. also desi ' s actions concerning michael
( andrew keegan
)
, odin ' s former teamate
and best friend who was kicked off the team beccause of one of hugo ' s machinations
, is puzzling
. why she would constinually be seen with michael
-
however innocent the circumstances
- when she knows her man suspects the two of cheating behind his back
. it is irrational
.
but these are minor carpings
. overall
, o is a stylish
and faithful adaptation
. if nothing else
, it may encourage some people to read the original text
,
and that will counterbalance the severity of this feature
.
