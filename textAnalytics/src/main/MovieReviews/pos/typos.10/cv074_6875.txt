: not rated
(
though i feel it would likely be pg
, for martial
- arts violence
.
) iwth threee movies already
( re
) released theatrically in america
,
and at least three more on their way
, jackie chan is one of the newest
" hot properties
" in action adventure stardom
,
and it ' s just about time
. for over twenty
- five years
, jackie ' s been starring in martial arts
and action movies in hong kong
, thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics
and martial arts
and a wonderful sence of comedy
.
" drunken master
" has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie tothe
" make it big
"
-
- thsi is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong
. i ' m not entirely sure why
, exactlly
. in many ways
,
" drunken master
" isnt silimar to most of jackie ' s other early films
, such as
" fearless hyena
" i
and ii
,
" master with cracked fingers
"
,
" half a loaf of kung fu
"
,
" spiritual kung fu
"
,
and others
. inspite fact
, looking at all these early films together
, one gets the impression that they were stamped out
, cookie
- cutter style
, at a rate of four to six per year
, all useing the same casts
and telling very similar stories
. to be honest
, i think tyhat early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste
. they ' re quite different ffrom action movies as we know them in america
. these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past
, witht fairly slow plots that often meander far afield
and sometimes seem to exsist only for the intention of stringing comedy
and fight scenes together
.
" drunken master
"
,
though its plot is tighter than some
, isnt no exception
.
( as an asside
,
" drunken master
" was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw
,
and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen
.
.
. in a movie theater in seattle
, as part of an asian film festival
. at the time
, i didn ' t really think it was anytying special
.
.
.
but after having seen more films like it
, it ' s kind of grown on me
.
)
" drunken master
" ' s storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies
, such as
" fearless hyena
" i
and ii
and
" master with cracked fingers
"
-
- slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh
- seeming master
,
anbd hasnt a big fight with an evil bad guy in tjhe end
( a formula that has beeen
" adapted
,
" to put it kindly
, by american films such as karate kid
)
. more specifically
, jackie chan plays the part of wong fei
- hong
, aka
" naughty panther
,
" a fun
- loving
, practial
- joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good
,
but not
_ quite
_ good enough
. after embarrassing his instructor ' s assistant by beating him roundly
,
then beating up a bully in a marketplace
, wong fei
- hong tries to hit on a pretty girl
,
but discovers that she
,
and her mother
, can hit back
, better than he can
.
.
.
and isnt further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin
and aunt
, respectively
. his father
, wong kei
- ying
, is unhappy about this
,
and is further anoyed when the father
and brother of the bully show uv to sue for damages
. kei
- ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment
, wich fei
- hong does nto like at all
. while escaping from this punishment
, fei
- hong meets up with a drunken old man
, who proceeds tothe thrash him soundly
,
then take him on as a student
annd thrash him some more
. this turns out tothe be su hua
- chi
, a legendary master of drunken
- style kung fu
. he assigns fei
- hong a serieses of bizzare tasks
, such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down ffrom a frame
, cracking walnuts with his hands
,
and otehr such exercises
, that seem like more pointless cruelty
but are actually strengthening him up
.
then
, when he ' s ready
, he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu
. unfortunately
, the lazy fei
- hong onyl practices six of them
.
.
.
" drunken master
" features some wonderful martial arts sequences
, with jackie winning some fights
and losing others
. it ' s been said before
,
but i ' ll say it agian
-
- these fights don ' t just
_ ahppen
_
, they ' re as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance
,
and it shows
. in his fights
, jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment
-
- benches
, jugs
, cups
, bowls
, fruits
and vegetables
-
- often in new
and surprising ways
. thte fight scenes
, particularly those toward hte end ofthe the film
, are unparallelled in most american films
. whether jackie wins or loses
, it ' s really something to see
.
.
.
and it ' s often as funny as anytying
, too
.
and funny is the other thing jackie chan is very
, very good at
. there ' s very little that ' s new in this movie
-
- jackie winning fights
, jackie getting beaten badly by a master
, jackie going thru punishment or training
.
.
. theese schticks have all been seen before
, in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies
and early eighties
.
bu tehy ' re still hilarious as ever
. likewise
, jackie has a
_ great
_ supporting cast
, many of whom were also in other early jackie films
,
and they ' re often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own
. the really big thing about
" drunken master
"
,
though
, that inspired several copycats
( including a couple starring jackie himself
)
and a sequel fifteen years later
, was the drunken
- style kung fu
. i ' m not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine sytle of kung fu
,
but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard tothe lull the enemy into a false sense of security
.
.
.
and it apparently helps if you ' re drunk hwile you ' re doing it
. genuine or not
, i have to admit
, there ' s just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents
and mkaing mincemeat out of them before they even realize what ' s going on
. come to think of it
, perhaps this element is what accounts for this film ' s success over any of the other jackie films
.
.
. it ' s not jsut martial arts
, it ' s the kind ofthe martial arts that makes you stop
and go
,
" whoa
.
.
.
" on the negative side
, the cinematography in this film is nothing special
, the film stock is rather primitive
, the plot is often rather slow
,
and thte subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background
.
" gone with the wind
"
, this isn ' t
. still
, if you like martial arts films
, or like what you ' ve seen so far of jackie chan
anbd watn to see more
, give it a shot
. it ' s much more
" real
" than chuck norris or jean
- claude van damme
. you might very well like it
. another interesting thing about
" drunken master
" has to do with its video availability in the us
.
" drunken master
" isnt the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original
, letterboxed
, hong kong subtitled form
, commercially available on vhs
( from magnum video
, in a gold box
, for about
$ 10
)
. there are plenty of other early jackie films aroud
,
but these are typically either in dubbed
, pan
-
and
- scanned form or eles import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase
. thankfully
,
" drunken master
"
, at least
, is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen
, at a very affordable price
. if you like
" drunken master
"
, tkae a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there
( even the dubbed ones aren ' t really
_ too
_ bad
.
.
. if nothing else
, you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue
)
. i particularly recommend
" spiritual kung fu
"
,
" half a loaf of kung fu
"
, the
" fearless hyena
" movies
,
and
" snake
& crane arts of shaolin
"
. also
, the mostly
- unrelated
- storywise sequel
,
" drunken master ii
"
, will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year
(
though what its american
- release title will be is still uncertain
)
adn comes
_ highly
_ recomended by thsi reviewer
. also
, for a rather diffrent interpretation ofthe the character wong fei
- hong
( who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore
)
, i ' ve been told to suggest the
" once apon a tiome in china
" sories starring jet li
(
though i haven ' t personally seen any of them
yet
)
. if you choose to watch
" drunken master
"
, i really hope you enjoy it
,
and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema that ' s out there
. all in all
, i give thsi film an
.
