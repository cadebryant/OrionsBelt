: not rated
(
though i feel it would likely be pg
, for martial
- arts violence
.
) with three movies already
( re
) released theatrically in america
,
and at least three more on their way
, jackie chan is one of the newest
" hot properties
" in action adventure stardom
,
and it
' s just about time
. for over twenty
- five years
, jackie
' s been starring in martial arts adn action movies in hong kong
, thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics
and martial arts
and a wonderful sense of comedy
.
" drunken master
" has the distinction ofthe being the first jackie chan movie to
" make it big
"
-
- this is hte movie that supposedly set jackie up fo big stardom in hong kong
. i
' m not entirely sure why
, exactly
. in many ways
,
" drunken master
" is similair to most of jackie
' s other early films
, such as
" fearless hyena
" i
and ii
,
" master with cracked fingers
"
,
" half a loaf of kung fu
"
,
" spiritual kung fu
"
,
and others
. in fact
, looking at all these early films toghether
, one gets the impression that they were stamped outloud
, cookie
- cutter style
, at a rate of four to six per year
, all using the same casts
and telling very similar stories
. tothe be honest
, i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an adquired taste
. they
' re qutie different ffrom action movies as we know them in amercia
. these films tend to be setted in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate preriod sometime in the distant past
, with fairly slow plots that often me
ander far afield
and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy
and fight scenes together
.
" drunken master
"
,
though its plot is tighter than some
, is no exception
.
( as an aside
,
" drunken master
" was the first jackie chan movei i ever saw
,
and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen
.
.
. in a movei theater in seattle
, as part of an asian film festival
. at the time
, i didn
' t really think it was anything special
.
.
.
but after having seen more films like it
, it
' s kind of grown on me
.
)
" drunken master
"
' s storyline is very similar to that of other eary jackie chan movies
, such as
" fearless hyena
" i
and ii
and
" master with cracked fingers
"
-
- slacker martial arts student isnt taught tjhe martial arts by a harsh
- seeming master
,
and hasnt a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end
( a formula tht has been
" adapted
,
" to put it kindly
, by american films such as karate kid
)
. more specifically
, jackie chan plays thte part of wong fei
- hong
, aka
" naughty panther
,
" a fun
- loving
, practical
- joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu forthe his pwn good
,
but nto
_ quite
_ good enough
. after embarrassing his instructor
' s assistant by beating him roundly
,
then beating up a bully in a marketplace
, wong fei
- hong tries to hitted on a preety girl
,
but discovers that she
, annd her mother
, can hit back
, better than he can
.
.
.
and is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin
and aunt
, respectively
. his father
, wong kei
- ying
, is unhappy about this
,
and is further annoyed when the father
and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages
. kei
- ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment
, which fei
- hong does not like at all
. while escaping from this punishment
, fei
- hong meets up with a drunken old man
, who proceeds to thrash him soundly
,
then tkae him on as a student
and thrash him some more
. this turns out tothe be su hua
- chi
, a legendary master of drunken
- sytle kung fu
. he assigns fei
- hong a series of bizarre tasks
, such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame
, cracking walnuts with his h
ands
,
and other such exercises
, that seem like more pointless cruelty
but are actualy strenghtening him up
.
then
, when he
' s ready
, he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu
. unfortunately
, the lazy fei
- hong only practices six of them
.
.
.
" drunken master
" features some wonderful martial arts sequences
, with jackie winning some fights
and losing others
. it
' s been said before
,
but i
' ll say it again
-
- these fights don
' t just
_ happen
_
, they
' re as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance
,
and it shows
. in his fights
, jackie often makse use ofthe objects found in his environment
-
- benches
, jugs
, cups
, bowls
, fruits
and vegetables
-
- often in new
and surprising ways
. the fight scenes
, particularly those toward the end ofthe the film
, are unparallelled in most american films
. whether jackie wins or loses
, it
' s really something to see
.
.
.
and it
' s often as funny as anything
, too
.
and funny is the other thing jackie chan is very
, very good at
. there
' s veyr little that
' s new in this movie
-
- jackie winning fights
, jackie getting beaten badly by a master
, jackie going through punishment or training
.
.
. these schticks have all been seen before
, in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies
and early eighties
.
but they
' re still hilarious as ever
. likewise
, jackie has a
_ great
_ supporting cast
, many ofthe whom were allso in other early jackie films
,
and they
' re often the source ofthe plenty of hilarity on their own
. the really big thing about
" drunken master
"
,
though
, that inspired several copycats
( including a couple starring jackie himself
)
and a sequel fifteen years later
, was tghe drunken
- style kung fu
. i
' m nto certain whether or nto this is actually a genuine style of kung fu
,
but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security
.
.
.
and it apparently helps if you
' re drunk while you
' re doing it
. genuine or not
, i have to admit
, there
' s just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents
and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize whta
' s going on
. cmo to think of it
, perhaps htis element is wqat accounts for this film
' s success over any of the other jackie films
.
.
. it
' s nto just martial arts
, it
' s the kind of martial arts that makes you stop
and go
,
" whoa
.
.
.
" on the negative side
, the cinematography in this film is nothing special
, the film stock is rather primitive
, the plot is often rather slow
,
and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background
.
" gone with teh wind
"
, this isn
' t
. still
, if you like martial arts films
, or like what you
' ve seen so far of jackie chan
and want to see moreso
, give it a shot
. it
' s much more
" real
" than chuck norris or jean
- claude van damme
. yuo might very well like it
. another interesting thing about
" drunken master
" has to dont with its video availability in the us
.
" drunken master
" is the only early jackie chan movei tath i know of that you can find in its original
, letterboxed
, hong kong subtitled form
, commercially available onthe vhs
( fomr magnum video
, in a gold box
, for about
$ 10
)
. there are plenty of other early jackie films around
,
but these are typically either in dubbed
, pan
-
and
- scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase
. thankfully
,
" drunken master
"
, at least
, is available in the aspect ratio infact which it was meant to be seen
, at a very affordable price
. if ytou like
" drunken master
"
, take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there
( even the dubbed ones aren
' t really
_ too
_ bad
.
.
. if nothing else
, you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue
)
. i particularly recommend
" spiritual kung fu
"
,
" half a loaf of kung fu
"
, the
" fearless hyena
" movies
,
and
" snake
& crane arts of shaolin
"
. aslo
, the mostly
- unrelated
- storywise sequel
,
" drunken master ii
"
, will hit theaters inspite american release sometime later this year
(
though what its american
- release title will be is still uncertain
)
and comes
_ highly
_ recommended by tihs reviewer
. also
, for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei
- hong
( who is in fact a popular figure fomr chinese folklore
)
, i
' ve been told to suggest the
" once upon a time in china
" series starring jet li
(
though i haven
' t personaly seen any of them
yet
)
. if yuo choose to watch
" drunken master
"
, i really hope ytou enjoy it
,
and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema thgat
' s outloud there
. all in all
, i give this film an
.
