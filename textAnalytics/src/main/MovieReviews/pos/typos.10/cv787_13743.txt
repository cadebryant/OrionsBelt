if chris farley had strapped some fake mutton
- chop sideburns to each side of his head
, spoken with a thick irish accent
,
and tried his damnedest to play it straight
, he wouldn
' t hvea been nearly as funny as brendan gleeson in
" i went down
.
" gleeson
, who
' s not dissimilar to the late
" saturday night live
" alumnus infront terms of fysical attri
butes
, plays a character named bunny kelly in this delightful irish film
. bunny is sent to county cork to
" retrieve
" one frank grogan for an irish gangster called tom french
( well dressed like all good gangsters should be
and menacingly portrayed by tony doyle
)
. bunny is to accompany git hynes
( peter mcdonald
)
, recently released from prison
and obligated to tom for disfiguring one of his cronies
. that tom french is a mean bollocks
. he wants frank back
.
and a small matter of some
? 25
, 000 that tom
' s wife was supposed to ahve given to frank
. for this he won
' t break anyone
' s thumbs
. maybe
. inventively
and engagingly written by conor mcpherson
and directed by paddy breathnach
,
" i whent down
" follows the trials
and tribulations of git
and bunny as they knock around peat bogs
, dimly
- lit pubs
, anbd seedy hostelries trying to stay alive
and out of trouble
. mcdonald is a newcomer
and a promising one at that
, bu gleeson has been in over a dozen movies
, most recently as father bubbles in another film with a very irish accent onthe hilarity
,
" the
butcher boy
.
" even if yuo can
' t comprehend half of what htey
' re saying
, gleeson
and mcdonald toghether mkae
" i went down
" a trip worth taking
. the film is inaddition many ways reminiscent of another
" little
" independent feature
, 1991
' s
" highway 61
.
" that film
, too
, was a road movie
and it shares the same kind of wry dialogue
and humorous situations as mcpherson
' s tale
: whimsical observations on life
, carefully
- crafted vignettes
, deadpan conversational asides
,
and scenes that
' ll make you laugh out loud
. witness the episode in which our ogod
- natured protaganists bind frank
( played by peter caffrey
) to a hotel bed
, leaving him with only the tv remote for company
. that sequence alone is on a par with satan locking himself out of his car in
" highway 61
.
" what
' s also charming about
" i went down
" is how the relatiopnship between buddy
and git develops
. their trip becomes an education for both of them
,
but the way it
' s h
andeled is neither sappy nor labored
. tyhe only thing in the film which approaches clunkiness is the culminating explanation
, via flashbacks
, of the relationship between frank
and tom
. it
' s a little too hollywood
,
and what makse
" i whent down
" so refreshing is the fact that it rarely p
anders to traditional conventions of hollywood gangster movies
. sure it
' s gritty
-
- make that grubby
-
- bu it
' s also pretty goofy
.
al
though
" i went down
" emphasizes the commedic elements of dis
- organized crime
, there are a couple of fairly brutal scenes in keeping with the subject matter
. don
' t let theese deter you
,
though
;
" i went down
" is a little gem
. it
' s only palying at one philadelphia
- area theater
-
-
and i suspect it won
' t be there for long
-
- so catch it while you can
.
