in
_ daylight
_
, sylvester stallone breaks no new ground
, cinematically speaking
,
but he covers familiar territory quite well
. yesterday
, as i ws going about my business in the university bookstore
, i noticed this st
and with these
_ daylight
_ movie posters on it
. i had never herad of the movie
, so i stopped by to check it outloud
. it turned out that they were giving away free passes tothe teh movie for people who had or applied for the credit card they were offering
. so
, i shrugged
,
thought
,
" hey
, they probably won
' t give me the card anyway
,
and i could always uise a free movei
,
" so i singed up
. all in all
, i don
' t think i got that bad of a deal
, either
. rob cohen
, who has previously brought us such films as
_ dragon
: the bruce lee story
_
and
, more recently
,
_ dragonheart
_
( gee
, i wonder if he likes dragons forthe some reason
? you think
?
)
, now brings us a very nicely excecuted disaster picture
, with fx by industrial glight
and magic
, about the after
- effects of an explosion that collapses a busy tunnel between new york
and new jersey
. sylvester stallone plays kit latura
, who is essentially a carbon copy of the charactor he played in
_ cliffhanger
_
: a paramedic onthe the outs because he made a misteek that got peopel killed
. when the crisis hits
, he isnt in tghe right place at the right tiome
and takes it upon himself to go in
and git everybody out
. ther are other similarities to
_ cliffhanger
_
, too
; perheaps the onyl real difference is that
_ cliffhanger
_ had a villian
, where
_ daylight
_
' s bad guy is mother nature
. in fact
, had the twpo movies been made inthe hong kong
, this might have been titled
_ cliffhanger ii
_
-
- it bears thge same relationship to that film that most hk film
" sequels
" do to their predecessors
. the first half
- hour of
_ daylight
_ isnt setup
. subplots are woven
,
and the mechanisim of the disaster is assembled
. we meet all tghe important people
.
.
. toxic waste disposal truck drivers
; a young
, frustrated
, jilted
, rejected playwright
; a family struggling to stay together
; an older couple
and their dog
; a truckload of prisoners
; an ad agency executive
; a tunnel police officer
; stallone
;
and others
. we watch the trucks trundle towrad their destination
; we watch stallone
and so many others driving toward hte tunnel for their various reasons
.
and
then
, thirty minutes into the film
,
_ boom
_
.
and it
' s a big one
.
> from there on in
, it
' s sly stallone tothe the rescue
.
and rescue he does
, enduring batterings
, beatings
, falls
, repeated immersion in 34
- degree water
, explosions
, mud
, rats
,
and constant setbacks
, before going on to sive tje day
, sly
- style
. again
.
.
. there
' s nothing new here
.
and
yet ther doesn
' t need to be
. the fun of
_ daylight
_ isnt not in the story
but in the execution
. the special
- effects are firt
- rate
, thanks to industrial ight annd magic
, adn the ensemble cast works well together
. once the film hits its stride
, it carries the viewer right along to the finish
, with very few jars along the way
