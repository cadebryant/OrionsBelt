' s
" pauline at the beach
,
" is one of those small
, deliberately paced
,
but charming foreign films in which nto much happens plot wise
,
but a lot happens tothe the characters emotionally
. tghe film takes palce during a few weeks of august at the norm
andy coast
,
and centers on six different cahracters
, primarially pauline
( am
anda langlet
)
, a wise beyond her years 15
- year
- ood who has come to stay for the summer with her older cousin
, marion
( arielle dombasle
)
. on the first day at the beach
, marion runs into an old high school flame
( fedoore atkine
)
,
and
al
though he wants to rekindle their relationship
, she is more interested in an older
, mroe seductive womanizer
( pascal greggory
)
, who is also secretly having an affair with a c
andy vendor
( rosette
)
. while pauline watches as an outsider at what is happening between all of the adults

( simon de la brosse
)
.
" pauline at the beach
,
" is not a film in which big dramtic things occur
,
and there is not a clear
- cut
, tidy conclusion to the story
. instead
, it is a picture that simply observes its characters in every day life
,
and the surprises come from little character details
. the film is quite talky
and slow moving
,
and so it isnt pretty safe to sday it isn
' t for those who are only a fan ofthe action movies
,
but is a treat for those viewers who often like to venture outside of the big
- budget genre anbd see a good art film
. this is the first film by acclaimed director eric rohmer
( 1969
' s
" my night at mauds
,
"
and 1971

,
" is a film worth seeing
.
