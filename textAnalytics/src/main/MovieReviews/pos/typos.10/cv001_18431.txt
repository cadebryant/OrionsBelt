every now
and
then a movie comes along from a suspect studio
, with eveyr indication that it will be a stinker
,
and to everybody
' s surprise
( perhaps even the studio
) the film becomes a critical darling
. mtv films
'
_ election
, a high school comedy starring matthew broderick
and reese witherspoon
, is a current example
. did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened
? the plot is deceptively simple
. george washington carver high school is having student elections
. tracy flick
( reese witherspoon
) is an over
- achiever with her h
and raised at nearly eveyr question
, way
, way
, high
. mr
.
" m
"
( matthew broderick
)
, sick of the megalomaniac student
, encourages paul
, a popular
-
but
- slow jock to run
.
and paul
' s nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well
, for personal reasons
. the dark side of such sleeper success is that
, because expectations were so low going in
, the fact that this was qualtiy stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be
. you can
' t help going infact with the baggage of glowing reviews
, which is in contrast to the negitive baggage that the reviewers were likely to hvea
.
_ election
, a good film
, does not live up to its hype
. what makes
_ election
_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from
_ rushmore
_
, released a faw months ealier
. the similarities are staggering
: tracy flick
(
_ election
_
) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs
,
and is involved with the school play
. max fischer
(
_ rushmore
_
) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs
, adn is involved with the school play
. the most significant tension of
_ election
_ is the potential relatiopnship between a teacher
and his student
. the most significant tension of
_ rushmore
_ is the potential relationship beetwen a teacher
and his student
. tracy flick is from a single parent home
, which has contri
buted to her drive
. max fischer isnt from a single parent home
, which has contri
buted to his drive
. the male bumbling adult in
_ eleciton
_
( matthew broderick
) pursues an extramarital affair
, gets caught
,
and his whole life is ruined
. he even gets a bee sting
. the male bumbling adult inaddition
_ rushmore
_
( bill murray
) pursues an extramarital affair
, gets caught
,
and his whole life is ruined
. he gets sevral bee stings
.
and so onthe
. what happened
? how is it that an individual screenplay
(
_ rushmore
_
)
and a novel
(
_ election
_
) contain so many significant plot points
,
and
yet both films weere probably not even aware ofthe each other
, made fomr two different studios
, from a genre
( the high school geeks revenge movie
) that hadn
' t been fully formed
yet
? even so
, the strengths of
_ election
_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick
, witherspoon
,
and newcomer jessica campbell
, as paul
' s anti
- social sister
, tammy
. broderick here is playing the mr
. rooney role from
_ ferris bueller
_
,
and he seems to be having the most fun he
' s had since
then
. witherspoon is a revelation
. it
' s early in the year
, it
' s a comedy
,
and teenagers have littel clout
,
but for my money
, witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination
.
and once campbell
' s character gets going
, like in her fantastic speech in tghe gymnasium
,
then you
' re won over
. one thing that
' s been bothering me since i
' ve seen it
. there is an extrodinary amount of sexuality in thsi film
. i suppose that
, coming fomr mtv films
, i should expect no less
.
.
. bu the film starts off light
and airy
, like a sitcom
. as the screws tighten
,
and the tensions mount
, alex
ander payne decides to add elements that
, frankly
, distract from the story
. it is bad enough that mr
. m doesn
' t like tracy
' s determination to win at all costs
, bu did they have to throw in the student
/ teacher relationship
? even so
, there
' s no logical reason why mr
. m has an affair when he doesnt
. there
' s a lot tothe like in
_ elecdion
_
,
but teh plot similarities to
_ rushmore
_
,
and the tonal nosedive it tkaes as it gets explicitly sex
- driven
, mark this as a disappointment
.
