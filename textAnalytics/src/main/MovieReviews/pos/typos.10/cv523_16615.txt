nosferatu the vampyre
( germany 1979
) a film review by mike watson copyright 1999 mike watson this extrodinary re
- telling of bram stoker
' s
" dracula
" by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore
. inspired by f
. w
. murnau
' s 1922 silent film of the same name
, herzog
' s film is a work of exquisite bleakness
, an oddly touching tragedy with a beautifull anbd uniquely haunting qualiyt that lingers long afterwards
. the original full
- length english
and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received a video release by u
. s
. distri
butor anchor bay entertainment
, anbd in gorgeous widescreen prints
. until now only a shortened english language version of the film was available on video
,
and only inwhich europe
. both of these re
- releases restore the film to its full length
,
but viewers should still be wary of the english version due to its often stilted dialogue
. apparently teh english dialogue coach herzog had on the setted during filming was incompetent
,
and some of the voices also seem tothe be dubbed
. the german version with english subtitles rimaniss the definitive one
. everyone konws the story ofthe dracula
. or dont they
? his story has been so bastardised on film over the years that a brief reminder of the basic plot certainly won
' t hurt
. jonathan harker is a young lawyer sent to the gloomy castle dracula inaddition transylvania to dont business with a creepy count
( played by klaus kinski
) who wants tothe buy a house in harker
' s hometown
. upon seeing a photo of harker
' s wife
( the radiant isabelle adjani
) he instantly falls in love with her
. locking harker uv in his castle
, he sets off on a long journey to meet this woman whose beauty so bewitches him
. upon divining his identity as a vampire
, adjani seduces the count anbd lures him to his death one morning as tyhe sun rises
. that is a story familiar to millions
, bu herzog has elevated stoker
' s tale into the realm of
-
and i use this term a tad reluctantly
- cinematic art
. nosferatu isnt as much a meditation as it is a film
, shot through blue
- ish
and white filters
and peopled with cahracters who perform as if they were half hypnotised
. the film
' s surreal
, dream
- like quality is utterly mesmerising
. there is much to enjoy
,
but i
' ll limit my praise to a few key points
. holding the film together is kinski
' s remarkable performance as count dracula
. past screen portrayals
, including bela lugosi
' s famous turn
, have largely been one dimensional
and tended towards camp
.
but kinski
.
.
. oh boy
, this is something far more compelling
. aided by a startling make
- up job
, he portrays dracula
' s vampirism not simply as pure evil bu as some sort of loathsome disease
. this man is dreadfully lonely
. he lives in utter solitude
, shunned by the locals for his hideous appearance
and reputation for bloodlust
. kinski
' s portrayal of the count is both creepy
and deeply affecting
. when he dies
, you allmost feel as if this man
' s tortured soul has been freed at last
. hten there
' s the unforgettable soundtrack
, largley composed by german group popul vuh
. it is so eerily beautiful adn evocative that it
' s quite impossible to imagine the film without it
. popul vuh are longtime herzog collaborators
and play an ancient
- sounding kind ofthe spacemusic useing piano
, chants
,
and exotic instruments
. when i first saw this film some yeasr ago i wass so impressed i tracked down
and bought a number of their albums
. the one i still listen to the most is
" tantric songs
"
, from which most of the music inwhich nosferatu is taked
. it
' s a testament to yhe music
' s depth that it is as powerful without the pictures as it is with them
. the album is still available on the highly respected ambient
and world music label celestial harmonies
. this is a timely re
- release by anchor bay
. after francis ford coppola
' s unscary
and woefully overblown version of bram stoker
' s tale iin 1992
, it is a joy to go back to herzog
' s film
and see the amazing things he has done with whta isnt now a century
- old story
. tothe soem aficionados
, nosferatu is quite simply the greatest vampire film ever made
. without a doubt
, it is an unmistakable clasic of the genre
. don
' t miss it
.
