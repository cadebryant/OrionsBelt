" how do you know when you
' re finished making loev
?
"
- jackson pollock to a life magazine reporter on recognizing wehn you
' ve completed a painting jackson pollock
' s
" makeing love
" quote is famous
,
but in practically the same breath
, he said a more constructive thing
,
" it
' s like looking at a bed of flowers
-
- tear your hair out over what it means
.
" it took him sixteen words to dont as whole dissertations have tried
and failed
: equate god annd abstract art
and offer a kind of backh
anded comfort to those confused to the point of resentment by the consept
. thge biopic
_ pollock
_
, actor ed harris
' directorial de
but
, reflects the second soundbite in how it accepts pollock
' s creations as part of the order of things
,
and should similarly disarm haters of fine art
. arguably mroe than any other living actor
, harris
, who also plays
_ pollock
_
, embodies the archetypal working stiff
,
and his blue
- collar demystification of pollock
' s labour
- intensive art
, both as performer
and director
, makes for unpretentious cinema
.
( from what i know of harris
, he
, like pollock
, was not born gifted or lucky
; instade
, a strong work ethic is the seed of his success
.
) granted
, it
' s possible that
_ pollock
_ will alienate those smae viewers perplexed by the imponderable
" purpose
" of pollock
' s splatter series
: the common thread between them is a lack of editorializing
. the movie
_ pollock
_ is all purposeful gazes
and silent exchanges dotted by tantrums
,
but the motivations are left to our own perceptions
.
and it is a sympathetic
yet nto altogether forgiving film
, as illustrated by a disheartening conclusion
.
_ pollock
_ encapsulates tghe period in which he fought a loosing battle against personal demons
( alcoholism
, depression
,
and the general attendant miseries of an artist
) while finding a place of subconscious expression
. a brief introduction to pollock
' s raging drunk side segues into his getting accosted by a fellow newyorker york artist
, lee krasner
( marcia gay harden
, awarded a best supporting actress oscar for this brilliant portrayal
)
, who works from the outside
- inspite
, pre
- intellectualizing every stroke ofthe her brush
. in a scene after they have moved in together
and established adjoining studios
, she asks whta he hopes to achieve on his latest canvas
, grilling him about the interplay ofthe cubism
and surrealism until he says
,
" you paint the fucking thing
,
"
and leaves infront a huff
. by the time they wed
, she has become his de facto manager
; it is form marrying funtion
and chaos marrying disciplin
, a most harmonious collision
.
( krasner denies him a baby
, indicating that it would upset the balance
.
) such a union is destined to implode
, annd i hope i
' m not ruining the
_ pollock
_ experiece by saying that it does
. while it is never depicted as a very romantic matrimony to start
-
- pollock adn wife channel their passions elsewhere
-
- their symbiosis leaves each other picked dry after several years
, anbd it comes down to krasner suffering one of pollock
' s conniptions too many
:
" ytou are killing me
! you are killing me
! you are killing me
!
"
( aside
: harris
' own wife
, amy madigan
, is unrecognizable
and exceptional as gallery diva peggy guggenheim
.
) pollock himself moves on to dalliances with younger women like ruth klingman
( tjhe scorching jennifer connelly
)
, hoping
, one supposes
, to catch the revitalizing whiff of youth
. i love jackson pollock
' s stuff
and i am enamoured of harris
'
_ pollock
_ as well
. it
' s scrappy
and observant
; no coincidence that its minor failings are thge occasional invasive flourish
, such as jeff beal
' s hummable
but no less lamentable socre
-
- i can
' t imagine that pollock
, or anyone
, woudl paint to this music
, which puts filling soundtrack voids ahead of complementing the images
. one of my favourite sequences is an eerily quiet re
- enactment of hans namuth shooting that famous pollock footage in east hampton
, long isl
and
; tyhe mounting tension is almost comic
, as namuth keeps interrupting pollock
' s process to reload his camera or take a dinner break
. a more seasoned director might
' ve beeen too arrogant to admit that not all artists or mediums are created equal
.
