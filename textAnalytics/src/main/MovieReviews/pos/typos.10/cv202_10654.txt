steven spielberg
' s
" amistad
,
" which is based onthe the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship
,
then were captured annd taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who
" owned
" them
, is concerned with several different spects of this story
. first
, the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery
. second
, it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case
, including president martin van buren
and former president john quincy adams
( anthony hopkins
)
. last
,
and most importantly
, it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery
and the damage done to their native culture in africa by thte slave trade
.
" amistad
" succeeds at least partly withthe all three of these elements
. i have to admit taht i was a little skeptical as tothe how much i could really git out of anyother
" anti
- slavery
" movie
. having seen several other movies
and documentaries about slavery
, i doubted thyat there was much i didn
' t already know about it
. fortunately
, i turned out to be wrong
. for one thing
, spielberg
' s camera never once gets near a southern plantation
and instead sticks to the slave ships
and the slave traders
' operations in africa
, so
" amistad
" was dealing with a different part of the hitory of slavery from the vrey beginning
.
and some of the images here are
, in fact
, much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery
. one scene in thge middle
, in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some ofthe thier
" excess
" slaves by throwing them overboard to drown
, has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year
. spielberg digs farther into the evils ofthe slavery than i was expecting he would
,
and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director cxan without getting an nc
- 17 rating
. thte stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicans
, such as president van buren
and queen isabella of spain
, whose naval officers were involved inwhich the legal dispute
and who was only a small child at the time
. exposing politicians as narrow
- minded
, opportunistic hypocrites is fairly st
andard stuff
, of course
,
but spielberg
and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation
. the film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time
, such that john quincy adams
(
and probably other politicians like him
)
, who clearly disapproved of the practice
, was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court
. the biggest success of
" amistad
" is probably the characterization of cinque
( djimon hounsou
)
, who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans adn struggles to communicate with baldwin
( matthew mcconaughey
)
, the lawyer who represents them in court
. through cinque
, we are given a window into the native culture
, as he
and hte displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member
, or find an illustrated version of the bible
and try to underst
and the story of jesus christ
. cinque sees tyhe dispute with a clarity
and simplicity that
, again
, contrasts with the technicalities
and mechanics ofthe the legal process
and of the polliticel squabbles
.
" what kind of country is this
, where laws
' almost
' work
?
" he asks baldwin in bewilderment
, when he learns that the case must be re
- tried before the supreme court
. spielberg
' s direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times
, such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell tothe cinque
' s angry outburst in the court room
. still
, there isn
' t enough of this for it to be a sereous problem
. the main flaw in this film
, which prevents it from earning four stars
, isnt that it seems like spielberg
and franzoni can
' t quite h
andle all of these issues at tyhe same time
, so instead they settle for addressing each one separately
and simpley editting the results into the same movie
. this summer
' s contact
, for exemple
, dealt withthe several issues at once
,
but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene
and
, most importantly
, all ofthe them weere resolved at once
.
" amistad
" tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams
,
but it somehow feels a little forced
,
and in any case the speech itself
, which lasts almost fifteen minutes
, wears out its welcome about halfway through
. perhaps the best way to describe it is this
:
" amistad
" is three four star films edited inot one
. almsot every individual scene works
,
but the final product is lacking the necessary focus
and coherence
,
and thus is less than the sum of its parts
.
however
, i can
' t honestly say how it could have been done differently
, annd in any case the story comes thru with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film
,
and thus i recommend it to anyone who cant h
andle the disturbing imagery
.
