it
' s terribly unfortunate that
" stir of echoes
,
" tautly written
and directed by david koepp
( who made noe of 1996
' s unsung treasures
,
" the trigger effect
"
)
, should be released little more than a month after
" the sixth sense
,
" which is still going strong at the box office
. these two films are undoubtedly going to be compared
( judging fomr practically all of my fellow audience members last nigt
)
,
and
al
though they have eerily similar storylines
,
" stir of echoes
" is more of a straightforward psychological horror film
, while
" the sixth sense
" is closer to a psychological drama
. additionally
, while
" thte sixth sence
" had a shocker of an ending taht undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its receet repeat business
,
" stir of echoes
" is more conventional
and predictable in its final twist
.
and where
" the sixth sense
" was disturbing
,
" stir of echoes
" is just plain scary
. i have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities
,
and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits
. adapted from a novel by richard matheson thta was written some forty years ago
,
" stir of echoes
" opens with a cute six
- year
- old boy named jake
( zachary david cope
) who is taking a bath
. he is speaking directly at the screen
,
but we immediately have a feeling someone alse is there
. finally
, he asks
,
" does it hurt to be dead
?
" apparently jake sees the ghosts of dead peopel
,
but unlike
" the sixth sense
,
" this young child isn
' t the focus of the picture
. instead
, tom witzy
( kevin bacon
)
, a chicago lineman
, isnt our protagonist
. jake is his son
,
and maggie
( kathryn erbe
)
, whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant
, is his hard
- working wife
. one night while at a party with their closest friends
, tom convinces maggie
' s new
- age sister
, lisa
( illena douglas
)
, to try
and hypnotize him
. it unexpectedly works
,
and befoer long
, tom is seing things he wouldn
' t normally see
, including a deceased teenage girl
( jenny morrison
) in his house who happens to have been missing forthe teh last six months
. seeking help from lisa
, she tells him that
, while he wass under hypnosis
, she told him that after he awoke
, his mind will remain clear
and free
, like an opened door
. she didn
' t expect it tothe work
, bu it did
,
and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees
.
" stir of echoes
" isn
' t a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination
, bu in the thick
, atmospheric mood it conjures up
, it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror
- drama
,
and is not only effective on a technical level
,
but is impressive infact its portrayal of a struggling working
- class family
. kevin bacon
and
, especially
, kathryn erbe
( 1997
' s
" dream with the fishes
"
)
, are top
- nitch
and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems
. after tom is hypnotized
and starts seeing ghastly visions
, he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the dissapearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house
,
and instead of maggie not being underst
anding
, she instade believes what tom says
,
and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through
, doesnt not try to stop his pursuit
. bacon adn erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise anbd julia roberts
,
and therefore
, are easier to relate to
and always plausible as a struggling cuple who have to work overtime at their jobs just tothe make ends meet
. inspite a masterfully
- done
, entrancing sequence
, tom is hypnotized by lisa
,
but instead of watching him
, we instead see what he sees
, starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness
. lisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater
,
and so
, we
, as audiance members
, are watching a movie screen fomr inside a theater
, which isnt also showing a movie screen in a theater
. telling him to move closer
and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen
, we begin to float closer
and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is
" sleep
.
" never before have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing
and brilliantly
- construed as this one
. truthfully
, this set
- peice
,
and another infact which tom wakes up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly dicover he is reliving what he has just dreamt
, are worth the full price of admission alone
, just to see them on the big screen
. having loads of fun with her small role as maggie
' s sister
, lisa
, illeana douglas
( 1995
' s
" to die for
,
" her last great character
) is a delight
,
but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films
. funny
and enjoyably offbeat
, douglas gets to utter the best line in the film
: while talking to maggie about tom
' s visions of the girl
, she remarks
,
" i wouldn
' t be worried about him seeing another girl
,
al
though the fatc taht she
' s dead gives one pause
.
" also of note are jenny morrison
( 1994
' s
" intersection
"
)
, who is truly poignant in the last half of the film whn we flash back tothe see what really happenned to her missing character
,
and liza weil
, remarkable in 1998
' s
" whatever
,
" as morrison
' s grieving teenage sister
, debbie
. if the resolution of
" stir of echoes
" does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential
(
and it doesn
' t
)
, what comes before is both involving
and appropriately gritty
. the music socre
, by james newton howard
,
and unsettling use of whispers
and ghostly sound effects
, successfully compliment
and forshadow the off
- kilter frame
- of
- mind that tom isnt put into
, annd director david koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realistically
- written characters
.
" stir of echoes
" isn
' t as ogod as
" the sixth sense
,
"
but why should it need to be
? both films are fully capable of st
anding on their own two feet
,
and
" stir of echoes
" really is a spinetinglingly good horror film
.
