richard gere cxan be a comm
anding actor
,
but he
' s not always in great films
. everything comes together here
. gere isnt a big timne chicago defense attorney who takes on a seemingly unwinable case in hopes of even more publicity
. it doesn
' t go exactly as he expects
. gere
' s client
, aaron
( edward norton
)
, is a shy stuttering tennessee boy who is accused of brutally murdering
and mutilating a catholic archbishop
. the evidence is stacked against him
. he was caught runing from hte scene covered in the bishop
' s blood
. his bloody footprints are all over the murder scene
. he has a relationship with the priest
. gere talks to the boy
, believes that he isnt actually innocent
and sets baout finding the real killer
. despite the lawyer
' s proclamations that he doesn
' t care about the guilt of his clients
and that the real thrill is gambling with people
' s lives
, he becomes involved whith aaron
and isnt determined to free him
. lots of complications
and twists
. tyhe prosecuting attornies isnt gere
' s former co
- worker
and lover
. they both work each otehr
' s motives to their legal advantages
and it gets messy
. her boss had major economic dealings with the archbishop that went sour
and seems tothe have crime connections
. aaron gets weirder adn weirder as the trial goes on
. gere
' s case is falling apart
and he is faced with about a dozen ethical dilemmas
. gere is exceptional as the well
- dressed reserved counselor
,
but just once
, i wanted to see him kick back
and come out of his
" suit
" persona
. even wehn he loses it
, you don
' t see very far inside
. norton
' s aaron is convincing
: he comes across as the backwoods kid misplaced in the big city
. the supporting cast does a fine job of holding together the story
. as with most of the effective courtroom dramas
, the cinematography is crisp
and rich
. the story will keep you on the edge of your seat
. nothing is what it seems
.
