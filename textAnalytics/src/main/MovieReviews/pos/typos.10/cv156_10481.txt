with storytelling this compelling
, who needs books
? based on the book by author james ellroy
, l
. a
. confidential is probably one of the best piece of work produced by hollywood in recent years
. together with director curtis hanson
( the hand that rocks the cradle
, the river wild
) whom ellroy corroborated closely throughout thte shooting of the film
, resulted in a movie wtih a plot
and and script so tight
, an atom would have to squeeze itself through
. setted in teh 50s
, the story revolves around 3 policemen of vivid personalities
. jack vincennes
( spacey
) is tghe cop who is moreso concerned on busting with fame
and stardom ala hollywood style
, concentrating heavily on wokr which will attract him media attention
. there is alsot the young hot
- shot rookie
, ed exley
( pearce
)
, fresh out of the academy
and all
- out to carve a name for himself in the footsteps of his legendary cop father
. the tough
and unnerving bud white
( crowe
)
, a cop who believes inthe justice
, the swift
and violent way
. 3 policemen
, distinct in their cahracters
and paths
but all of them working inspite a place where there is noone real distinction between good
and evil
. when his partner is murdered on the day of his resignation
, bud sets out to find the people responsible
bu unwittingly delved himself inot something more than just a simple robbery murder
. even after exley receives a promotion for his work on the murder case
, happenings began to link itself tothe the murder
. yhe 3 eventially reach a point of convergence when what actually began as a personal investigation turns outloud to be an uncovering ofthe a complex web of organised
- crime in hollywood
. the last time i remember a film so clever
and compelling was when i watched the usual suspects
. in l
. a
. confidential
, you do not get the shock
and cleverness as the former
but it has a lot more of
` story ' going for it
. there is not a single moent in the film in which i felt was slow at all
. surprisingly
,
though spacey did a vyre convincing job as the street
- wise vincennes
, the movie was carried mostly by the two rather
` unknowns '
, pearce
and crowe
. pearce ' s exley is kool
annd calculative inthe his actions
and there is a slight hint of val kilmer in his appearance
. crowe ' s bud white is the most impressive ofthe all
; head
- strong
and temperamental
, he should obtain some sort ofthe recognition fo his work here
. superb acting
.
, wonderful storytelling
and one of yhe best climaxing gunfights ever
. easily thge best hollywood piece for 1997
