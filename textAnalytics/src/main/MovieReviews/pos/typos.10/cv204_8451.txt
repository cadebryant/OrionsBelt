being that it is a foriegn language film with no known names whith a select number theaters showing it
,
" shall we dance
" won
' t be seen by that many people
.
and tht
' s a shame
- this is a funny
, enchanting
,
and goofy movie full of laughs
, surprises
,
and wonderful dance sequences
. the surprising thing about
" shall we dance
" is the universal appeal of the story
. a us version is in the works
,
and it
' s no wonder
- it
' s not really all that culture specific
.
al
though there is a narrated set
- up that adds some extra resonance to the proceedings
( baout the view the japanese culture hasnt about ballroom dancing
)
, the movie is so rich in character
and appeal that this added layer isn
' t at all necessary to underst
and or enjoy the film
. teh only important unexplained japanse
- specific reference that may leave some a bit puzzled is that 1000 yen is roughly
$ 10
( when yuo see tje film
-
and you should see this film
- you
' ll know why
)
. a middle aged company man realizes that achieving all the goals he set forthe himself in life
( a house
, a child
, anbd good marraige
) still doesn
' t translate inot a fulfilled life
. after glimpsing a melancholy beauty looking out from a dance studio window while on the train home from work
, sugiyana
( koji yakusho
) decides aftter some trepidation to take up ballroom dance lessons in order to meet the woman who has stirred something in himself
. after finding the weekly fees for private lessons from the elegant
and beautiful mai
( tamiyo kusakari
) too rich for his blood
, sugiyama opts for groups lessons simply to be near her
. we
then meet tghe players in this gem of a movie
, who all have their pwn reasons for joining the class
. later on
, we meet aoki at tghe dance studio
( naoto takenaka
)
, a co
- worker annd all out weirdo
and one of teh laugh riot highlights of the film
. the stry
, laughs
, adn touching scenes evolve as the movie goes along
. it
' s a pleasure tothe watch such a wonderful film thyat is propelled almost solely by the characters
and performances
. it
' s difficult to expalin the charms of the film without revealing too much
- the movie abounds with little revelations that subtly shape the charachters
,
and in thge end
, each one is that much fuller
and mroe understood by the time you leave the theater
. it
' s one ofthe those movies that only the french seem to make anymore
- noone big plot
, no special effects
, noone gunplay
, no tragic consequences
, no forced examinations of the nature of love
,
and no insights into tyhe nature of evil
. just a warm
, funny
, endearing film that will charm the pants off of ytou
. when was the last time ytou left a theater feeling all warm
and fuzzy inside
?
" shall we dance
" will do that to you without any treacly aftertaste
