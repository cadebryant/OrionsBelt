naturally
, at tje core of leon gast
' s
" when we were kings
" is tyhe fight itself
, for what a fight it was
. thanks to the business savvy of don king
, an ageing muhammad ali was pitted against the formidable hulk ofthe heavyweight champion george foreman
. fans were treated to an 8 round battle ofthe endurance
and strategy
, as much as brute strength
, that immediately entered boxing lore
. with thge benifit of the first
- h
and recollections of that old ex
- pug norman mailer
, this classic conflict is brought back to life
.
but
" wehn we were kings
" tackles issues that are harder to pin down than the simple facts of a boxing match
. questions of political power
and social justice appear throughout this documentary
. gast could hardly choose otherwise
, considering the vocal
, uncompromising politics of muhammad ali
. a member of the controvercial black seperatist movement the nation of islam
, ali opens gast
' s film with a forceful swipe at the united states
. when ali hollers
" damn america
'
, yhe audeince knows the imprecation is heartfelt
; the brutal
yet casual way it is uttered leaves no doubt that ali is speaking his mind
. his decision to buck the draft fo vietnam is defended with the same admirable fury
:
" noone viet cong ever called me nigger
"
, ali reasons
. despite showcasing ali
' s proud unequivocal politics
, one of the most impressive features of
" when we were kings
" is the subtle way in which the documentary considers the difficulties inherent in the overarching philosophy ofthe black unity
and black symbolism that ali
and his supporters champion
. listening to the film
' s numerous commentators
, it is clera that the geographic location for this
" rumble in the jungle
" is etched more in the imagination than anywhere you could place onthe a map
. spike lee tells us that the event was a pilgrimage
, a
" coming home
" to africa
. foreman reminds us that africa is the
" cradle of civilisation
"
. fair enough
,
but this homel
and is a specific nation cursed with a less than inspiring reality
. it is the newely founded zaire
and it is ruled by presient mo
butu
, a brutal dictator
. while ali respects mo
butu
' s ablity to forge an independent african state
, mailer notes that beneath the stadium in whlch the titans battled lay hidden the presidents well
- stocked torture chambers
. mailer
' s insights are lost on most of the film
' s commentators
. george plimpton recalls that he always felt he was in the congo
, rather than the newly christened zaire
. with admirable restraint
, gast quietly suggests that for many the gr
andeur of myth adn history all
but obscured the reality of zaire
' s squalid ruling elite
. mo
butu is not the only dubious character to benefit from the heady symbolism of black power
. don king
, resplendent in yellow kaftan
and at ease with the
" messiah
" label attri
buted to him by a loyal disciple
, passes himself off as the voice of a new black internation solidarity
. underst
andably
, foreman believes he has gotten a raw deal
. he may be
, as one sympathiser notes
,
" blacker
" than ali
, bu he is denied thte iconic status shared by ali
, the thuggish mo
butu
,
and tyhe tacky huckster don king
. africa
, zaire
, inspirational leader or vicious dictator
, all is left undifferentiated
, unconsidered
, in this optimistic celebration of black unity
. little wonder that the people of zaire weere shocked to find that ali
' s opponent wasn
' t white
. admittedly
, these issues are only hinted at
, rather tahn substantially explored
. the audience must consider hte significance ofthe these issues themselves
, in their own time
. there is just too much to cover
, too much that is truly worthy of celebration
, for a protracted political analysis to be justified
. the excitement of james brown
and b
. b king in concert
, for instance
.
and of course there
' s always ali to consider
, as he shamelessly
,
and hilariously
, hams it up in front ofthe the camera
, shadow boxing
and uttering one inspired rhyme after another
-
" we gonna git it onthe coz we don
' t get along
!
"
. doubtlessly
, considering the multi
- faceted nature of the extravaganza htey chose to cover
, the makers of
" when we weere kings
" faced numerous difficulties in deciding what issues
,
and what personalities
, best deserved their attention
. fortunately
, by refusing to simplify their complex subject matter
, they have captued the richness
and excitement of this unique event
.
