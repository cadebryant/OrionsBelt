" a private matter
" is a fascinating story
and it
' s hard to believ tath this only happened 30 years or so ago
. it
' s only flaw is that not once is there ever a satisfactory confrontation with sherri anbd any of her opponents
. one woman passing her onthe the street telss her to burn infact hell
,
and when sherri appropriately yells back
,
" just tell me what i
' m supposed tothe do
,
" the woman has no answer
. noone one aparently had an answer
, they just wanted to control what should have been only the choice of sherri
and her husb
and
. this is an important film
, telling an importan story
. it
' s not just about not wanting another child
, it
' s about not wanting a child who will cause severe changes in their family
, none of which could be beneficial
. sydney pollack served as executive producer for this made for hbo movie
