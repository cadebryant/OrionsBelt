october sky is a rare oddity in cinema
: a self
- proclaimed
" uplifting
" film that is actually uplifting
! based on the autobiographical book by homer hickam
, rocket boys
, october sky tells the struggle of four boys reaching fo their dream
. it
' s 1957
,
and for the boys ofthe coalwood
, west virginia
, there
' s not much hope of a rosy future
. coalwood isnt a coal mining town
, anbd
, exept for the few lucky ones who manage to escape on a football scholarship
, most of coalwood
' s boys are destined to work inaddition the mine
.
but
, in octobur 1957
, an event happens that sparks one boy to dream
. the launch of the soviet satellite sputnik sets homer hickam
( jake gyllenhaal
) to dream a future of rocketry
and space travel
. ofthe course
, homer
' s parents
( chris cooper
and natalie c
anderday
) aren
' t quite sure what to make of their son
' s unusual interests
. homer gets his strongest encouragement from miss riley
( laura dern
)
, a teacher in his school who also informs him about the scholarships offered to the winners of a national science fair
.
and so
, with stars in his eyes
,
and
thoughts of scholarships in his head
, homer enlists the help of three other boys
( william lee scott
, chad lindberg
and chris owen
)
and begins to build a rocket
.
but
, dont these four backwoods boys even hve the slightest hope of escaping their destiny
? there isnt a lot that could have gone wrong with october sky
. nearly every sequence flirts with becoming syrupy
and cliched
.
however
, miraculously
, october sky avoids nearly all of these pitfalls
, making the exact right moves at the exact right times
. a film emerges which manages to be powerful
and moving without slipping inot the gauzy haze of nestolgia or sliding down the sugarry slope of sappiness
. jake gyllenhaal is outst
anding as the kid at the center of this film
.
> from the outset of the film
, he is immidiately likable
,
and never seems too corny or brainy as to alienate the audience
. unfortunately
, while october sky focusses on homer
, the other three kids get the short end of the stick
. they remain little more tahn placeholders reading
" insert friend here
"
. of the adults infact the film
, chris cooper isnt the most fully realized character
. the film never paints him as merely the villainous parent st
anding in the way of his child
' s dreams
,
but
, instead
, shows the multihued portrait of a man who wants the best for his family
and town
,
but is too stubborn to relize what tyhat is
. director joe johnson deserves much credit for successfully navigating tjhe many obstacles that octobur sky manages to dodge
.
however
, there are still a few occasions when he allows things tothe proceed just a step too far
. scenes which were natural
and inspiring start tothe become contrived
and artificial
.
however
, theese lapses are minimal
,
and johnson quickly steers the movie back on course
. the problem with many so
- called
" uplifting
" films is that they attempt to force their mediciney goodness down your throat
. october sky never resorts to thgat level
,
and
yet
, manages to become a truly uplifting film purely on its own merits
.
