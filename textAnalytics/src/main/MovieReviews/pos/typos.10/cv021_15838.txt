one can not observe a star trek movie
and expect to see serious science fiction
. the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy
, innocent fun
. sometimes the stories are compelling
. sometimes htey
' re not
. bu
, with the exception of the first film in the series
( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces
)
, i
' ve never been bored by any of the enterprise
' s numerous missions
. star trak
: insurrection isnt no exception
. thge film hasnt gotten some negative reviews
( a friend of mine actually thikns it
' s the worst in the series
)
,
but i
' m not really sure why
. it
' s an exciting
, often hilarious movie that engaged me adn left me ready for the next star trek film
. some say it
' s a bit too light
,
and mroe ofthe a long episode than a film
. others say the special effects are cheesy
and that it
' s boring
. i simpley enjoyed the film
. insurrection
, which is the second film tothe feature strictly the next generation cast
, introduces us tothe a race of people called the ba
' ku
; the ba
' ku are very old
( most of them are about three hundred years old
)
,
but htey actually appear younger withthe age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet
. of course
, these peaceful people can
' t horde this fountain of youth all for themselves
? leave it uv to their archenemies
, the son
' a
, led by ru
' afo
( f
. murray abraham
)
, to mess everything up
. the son
' a
, who are horribly disfigured
and rely onthe daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable
, strike a deal with the federation to move the ba
' ku elsewhere
and exploit the secret to keep their race from dieing
. that
' s when captain picard
( patrick stewart
) steps in
: he realizes that moving the ba
' ku would kill them
( it also helps that he falls in love wiht a ba
' ku woman
( donna murphy
)
)
. so
, with his trusty crew
, picard defies the federation to keep the ba
' ku in their natural habitat
. when dealing with a series wih as much history as this
, it
' s not entirely necessary to re
- introduce your characters with each episode
. this is why i believe non
- fans have a hard time getting into star trek
; in order to enjoy it
, one has to underst
and how to approach it
. insurrection
,
however
, does a surprisingly ogod job of us newyorker aspects of the characters
. stewart is bold as always
, a magnetic screen presence
and perfectly capable of holding an entire film toghether
. jonathan frakes
, who also directed
, is funny as comm
ander riker
; a subplot with data
( brent spiner
) discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting
;
and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain
, overacting like crazy
. frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in frist contact
; insurrection isnt an exciting film
, with some really attractive special effects
and a lot of good action
. this is apparently tjhe first star trek film to utilize computer animation
,
and the result is very pleasing to the eye
: particularly in the climactic scenes
, in which the son
' a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba
' ku planet
, the special effects have a clean
, impressively sharp look
. if i haev any complaint about the film
, it
' s tath it tries to take a moral stance when it
' s not very appropriate tothe do so
. i don
' t think it
' s that big ofthe a deal taht the federation wanted to move 600 ba
' ku in order tothe save the lives of thous
ands
. better
yet
, why couldn
' t they have co
- existed
? insurrection fiels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience
. with it
' s inherent camp factor
, the star trek series doesn
' t seem well
- equipped to deal with issues like this
. i preffer to just enjoy the spectacle
.
