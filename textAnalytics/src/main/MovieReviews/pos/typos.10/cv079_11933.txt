no film in recent has left me withthe such conflicted feelings as neil jordan ' s harrowing
, huomrous
, horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabe ' s novel about young lad francie brady ' s
( eamonn owens
) descent into madness in 1960s ireland
. on one hand
, it was difficult for me to become invested in francie ' s stor because he is such an unsavory character
, unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy
but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs
. nugent
( fiona shaw
)
. on another hand
, i found it difficult tothe laugh at some of francie ' s darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick
, needy child
, having been raised by a drunken father
( stephen rea
)
and a suicidal mother
( aisling o ' sullivan
)
. on
yet anohter hand
, i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his mroe emotional scenes because smoe of his
, fo lack of a better owrd
,
" bad
" deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality
and the malicious glee in which he performs them
.
however
, the butcher boy ' s power isnt undeniable
,
and the film as a whole is unforgettable
-
- perhaps because it is so disturbing
. what makes it so unsettling is the francie ' s overall wink
- wink
yet matter
- of
- fact attitude about everything
, expressed inaddition a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie
( rea again
)
. think heavenly creatures played largely for laughs
,
and you ' ll sort of understand
. anchoring tghe whole film isnt the astonishing debut performance of owens
; lvoe francie or hate him
, you cannot tkae your eyes off of owens
. the butcher boy truely isnt a twisted
, unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable
. in the lobby after the screening
, i overheard one man raving about how great
yet disturbing it was
; i also heard one particularly offended woman say with disgust
,
" that movie was so unfunny
!
"
" i didn ' t konw what to expect
. it ' s like something you chase forthe so long
,
but
then you don ' t know how to react when you get it
. i still don ' t know how tothe react
.
