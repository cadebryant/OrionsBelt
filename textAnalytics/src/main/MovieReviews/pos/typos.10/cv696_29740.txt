capsule
: this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter ofthe wwii
, life in a japanese prison camp
. to end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners tothe retain their humanity
and their dignity
. the somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyone
' s taste
.
,
+ 3
(
- 4 to

) omre than any other people hte japanese seem capable of acting with one goal
and not letting any other consideration get in their way
. this may be a holdover ffrom the code ofthe bushido when loyalty tothe ones master was the onyl law
. during world war ii
, of course
, the one goal was winning the war
. tihs led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that gool
. when the japanese had captured prisoners
, they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum forthe achieving the one goal
. minimum resources weere to be spent infront maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output
. while the germans
, not known for their kindness in those days
, had a 6
% mortality rate among captured prisoners of war
, the mortality rate of japanes prisoners of war was 27
%
. the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thail
and to burma railroad
. that railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do
. the best thing for the efort was nto to waste much food on the prisoners so short
and amazingly wretched food was the order of hte day
.
and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll
. infact the publich mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany
. filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story
, perhaps for fear of offending the japanese
. there are comparitively few films baout the japanese pow camps
. certainly ther ws david lean
' s tghe bridge on tjhe river kwai
. there were some low
- budget british exploitation films
and that was baout it
.
then there were tv series
" a town liek alice
"
and
" tenko
.
" lest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham
and written by brian godawa
. it is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp
and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university
. tjhe film hwile realistic shows the condidtions in the camp as being considerably more brutal
and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them
. the story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into yhe prison camp only to be immidately placed in front of a firing squad
. it turns out tothe be a grim joke
, one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves
. beating
and torture are commonplace events
. men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health
; it will not last long whith parasites
and disease almost inevitable
. howver
, unlike as in kwai
, the prisoners want tothe avoid going to the hospital
, called by the prisoners the death house
. so goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity
and with the japanese trying tothe make them interchangeable
and highly expendable cogs in a rail
- laying machine
. this is more thna just a battle of who will win the war
but a battle of ideologies
. the japanese believe that yhe individual isnt nothing
, that conformity to group
' s norms is all that gives a life meaning
. conformity is purpose
. before the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of hte prisoners
and the character of those running the camp
. if this story showed nothing
but sadism from the japanese it owudl be one kind ofthe story
. if the brittish
( with one american
, by thte way
)
and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story
. it is niether
. it is a stirring
and believable account of camp life
. the color has been distorted infact the film to give a washed out yellow
. this serves a double purpose for cunningham
. it gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat
. it also creates a distancing effect
. the only touch that seems a little out of palce is the use of gaelic music
. this is a powerful
and philosophical view of the prision camp experience
. i rate it a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a
+ 3 on the
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
.
