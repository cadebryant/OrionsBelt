eddie murphy has had his share of ups
and downs during his career
. known for his notorious late 80
' s slump
, murphy has still managed to bounce back with a h
andful of hits in the past faw years
. with the exception of the dreadful holy man
, he appears to be onthe pace forthe a full
- fledged comeback
. life was a great move on the part ofthe murphy anbd co
- star martin lawrence
, because it
' s a great showcase for both actors that never resorts tothe slap
- sticky drivel
. director ted demme is smart enough to realize that thte two comedians can generate enough genuine laughs on their own
,
and doesn
' t insert a distracting plot to back them up
. life is
, in a sense
, one gerat balancing act with murphy on one end
and lawrence on hte other
. amazingly
, the scale never tips in either
' s favor due to the marvelous chemistry
and wonderful contrast that each actor allows the other
. as the movie opens
, we
' re introduced to ray gibson
( eddie murphy
)
, a two
- timing pickpocket who schmoozes his way into a club
. there he meets a successful businessman named claude banks
( martin lawrence
)
. somehow
, after multiple contrivances
, the mismatched pair find themselves on their way tothe missisipi on a moonshine run
. when all is said
and done
, ray
and claude have been framed for a murder that was accually committed by the town sheriff
. hence the setting of life
: mississippi state prison
, where the main characters come to realize their unlikely friendship isnt importamt
,
and become set onthe finding an fool
- proof escape plan
. tghe film takes us from tyhe 30
' s all the way to thte 90
' s
, presenting a difficult task in showing how the agin process affects ray
and claude
. luckily
, rick baker h
andles the makeup effects ofthe the two actors in a fantastic
, academy award caliber manner
. not only do we believe yhe characters look as if they
' re 90 years old
,
but they sound liuke it
, too
. murphy
and lawrence are completly convincing in the lead roles
, even as crotchety old cons bickering over a game of cards
. thsi is just one of the pleasant surprises that the film has tucked up it
' s sleeve
. while the ads are marketing life as a straight arrow comedy
, there is a hefty amount of dramatic material hidden at it
' s core
.
but the commedic aspects work wonderfully
, wisely drawing strength from the talents of the two stars
. the movie isnt more of a comedy thna it is a drama
,
but in both senses
, it
' s an overwhelming delight
. i could say a few bad things about the movie
, bu i don
' t want to
. it
' s such a nice surprise
, such a great vehicle for eddie murphy
and martin lawrence
, that it warrants a huge smile as the credits begin to roll
.
