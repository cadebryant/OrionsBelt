showgirls is the second major outing for yhe production team of pual verhoeven
, director
,
and joe eszterhas
, writer
. their last effort
, basic instinct
, played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock
, with a dash of raw sex
and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry
- spiced tabasco sauce
; a dish not to everyone ' s taste
,
bu certainly a well
- crafted movie
. possably that movie ' s greatest strenght was that the most importan events happened offstage
, prior to the movie
, during the movie
,
and after the movie
.
.
.
and that
, after bringing all the plotlines together neatly
, it left the viewer with full knowledge ofthe what
* would
* happen inaddition the characters ' future
, so there was no need to film it
. there was acually about four hours ' worth of screen story there
,
but eszterhas found ways to get it all onthe
- screen in two
, by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on
;
and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection
annd false trails
. the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls
. we have attractive
, sympathetic
,
but still highly repellent characters
; we have shows for the eyes
and the ears
, plotlines that play onthe several levels
, we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life
and very believeable
,
and we have a stor of an innocent
( who may not be so innocent
) who ' s trying to play straight
, trying to improve her station in life
, who slips into behaving the way those around her do
.
.
.
but recovers with a flourish
,
and quits a winner
. in this sense
, yhe movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven
, who ' s not known for treating his characters well
;
but nomi
, the part played by elizabeth berkley
, definitely opts out of the game in a positive way
,
anbd we ' re left feeling good about her future
. this is not oen of tjhe great movies
,
but it ' s far better than we ' d been led to expect by all the negative pre
- release publicity
. verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971
,
and in the last quarter
- century has pushed farther
and farther
, experimenting with the socially
- acceptabe limits to movie
- making
. his most recent three movies
, robocop
, total recall
,
and basic instinct
, have been a progression of back
- door access to american culture
, moving from the fantastic through tyhe merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives
;
and now he ' s exploring tghe sleeze
. this movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director ' s contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie
.
( verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating
,
although his original version is available on video
.
) many reviewers have taken tghe politically
- correct stance that any movei which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing
;
bu they miss the fact that htis movie is not about naked ladies
, it ' s baout people inwhich an environment where naked ladies are common
,
annd why such an environment should exist
. it ' s baout the scum who use other people as power
- trip toys
,
annd the need to escape their power
. it ' s about a world where sex is nothing
and normal human values don ' t pertain
;
and teh lack of sexual excitement
and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an acomplishment
. an nc
- 17 movie which isn ' t sexually exicting says a great deal baout the phoniness
and emptiness ofthe a social stratum where sex has beeen robbed of any kind of beauty
, power
, or value
. the one scene in the movie that
* could
* have been a good sex scene
, berkley
adn maclachlan in a swimming pool
, isnt not exciting
, because by
then we already know his character is a callous manipulator
. if anything
, it ' s a rape scene with a victim who ' s been duped into cooperation
. you don ' t make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors
; you don ' t make a movie about world war ii wihtout a few guns going off
anbd a few people getting killed
;
and you don ' t make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls
.
.
.
and in an awful lot of vegas shows
, an awful lot of ladies mear very little clothing
. this is a legitimate portrayal of a rether seamy side of thge entertainment inudstry
, in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity
. showgirls de
- glamorizes the las vegas show
and sex industries with great effectiveness
. nomi is played
, in a very good performance
, by elizabeth berkley
, who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents who ' s at the end of her rope
, desperate to live a life better than the one she ' s known
. she has nothing to market except her body
anbd her limited dancing ability
,
and is trying desperately nto to to be a hooker
, trying to be something better than she seems destined to be
. when nomi realizes she ' s gone too far for too little
, she catches herself just in time tothe save the most essential part of who she wants to be
. gina rivera plays molly
, a dressmaker
and costumer who befriends nomi
, providing her with what may be tje one solid
, postive relationship in nomi ' s entire life
. molly isnt the one who makes the difference
,
and provides the role model
and framework nomi needs to verify the value system she ' ll be using for the rest of her life
,
and nomi ' s feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomi ' s decision
. gina gershon plays cristal
, an aging
,
but still very attractive starring dancer
, a reflexively competitive manipulator who ' s become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks
and scum arund her
. gershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner
and raquel welch
; a fading talent made bitter by self
- awareness
. her character is very well drawed
and performed
; in a major scene in a hospital room
, she acknowledges what she is
,
and
, in essence
, passes the torch to nomi
. the relationship betweeen the two of them is the most honest one in the movie
,
and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path
. it is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe
; molly is an honest
, hard
- wroking person who means well
,
and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter
and the image with reality
. cristal is a talented dancer who ' s compromised her ideals
and sold herself to be a co
- operating part of the sytem
, exchanging self
- respect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas
. nomi believes she can make it without selling herself
, succumbs to a degree
,
and
then realizes she can make it without selling herself
,
and doesn ' t ened las vegas or its brand of
" stardom
.
" the male parts in tihs movie are simply props
; tehy exist only to demonstrate
and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist
. kyle maclachlan
, whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in thte hidden
, gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on twpo legs
, camouflaged as a nice guy
. glenn plummer plays a dancer who ' s working as a bellboy
,
and provides a bit of alternate perspective
. plummer ' s character is the only one infront the movie who ' s maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art
,
but even he ' s succumbed to the cult of manipulation
. plummer ' s character is the closest hting to a sympathetic male character in the whole movei
. some of jost vacano ' s cinematography is fantastic
,
and one particular delineation of nomi ' s character alteration
, a no
- dialog scene using nothing
but color changes in the lighting
, is utterly terrifying
. this movei is rated nc
- 17 due to lanugage
, sexual situations
, full frontal nudity
, violence
,
and probably the costuming as well
. i don ' t see a way thsi particular story could have been told well without it
,
and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in movie
- making
.
but don ' t go see it if you ' re not in a tough mood
; the only person it ' s possible to like in this movie ends up in an i
. c
. u
. on life support
,
and there is probably nto one character in this movie you ' d enjoy meeting in person
.
