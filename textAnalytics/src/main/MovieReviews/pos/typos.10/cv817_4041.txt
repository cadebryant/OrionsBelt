showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven
, director
,
and joe eszterhas
, writer
. their last effort
, basic instinct
, played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock
, with a dash of raw sex
and sensuality thgat made it come across withthe a hit liuke curry
- spiced tabasco sauce
; a dish nto to everyone
' s taste
, bu certainly a well
- crafted movie
. possibly that movie
' s greatest strength ws tath teh most important events hapened offstage
, prior to the movie
, during the movie
,
and after the movie
.
.
.
and that
, after bringing all thte plotlines together neatly
, it left the viewer with full knowledge of what
* would
* hppen in the characters
' future
, so there wass no need to film it
. ther was actually about four hours
' worth of screen story there
,
but eszterhas found ways to get it all on
- screen in two
, by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going onthe
;
and by still holding thier interest with clever misdirection
and false trails
. thte major elements that made basic instinct work so well are presetn in showgirls
. we have attractive
, sympathetic
,
but still highly repellent characters
; we have shows for the eyes adn the ears
, plotlines that play on several levels
, we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn fomr life
and very believable
,
and we have a story of an innocent
( who may not be so innocent
) who
' s trying to play straight
, trying to improve her station in life
, who slips into behaving the way those around her do
.
.
.
but recovers with a flourish
,
and quits a winner
. in this sense
, the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven
, who
' s not known for treating his characters well
;
but nomi
, the part played by elizabeth berkley
, definitely opts out of the game in a positive way
,
and we
' re left feeling good about her future
. this is not one of tjhe great movies
,
but it
' s far better than we
' d been led to expect by all the negative pre
- realease publicity
. verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971
,
and in the last quarter
- century has pushed farther
and farther
, experimenting with the socially
- acceptable limits to movie
- making
. his most recent three movies
, robocop
, total recall
, adn basic instinct
, have been a progression of back
- door access to american culture
, moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to thge underlying basic drives
;
and now he
' s exploring the sleeze
. this movie may be tje first movie ever made for which the director
' s contract contained a specfic provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie
.
( verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating
,
al
though his original version is available on video
.
) many reviewers have taken the politically
- correct stance thyat any movie whihc uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing
;
but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies
, it
' s about people in an environment where naked ladies are common
,
and why such an environment should exist
. it
' s about the scum who use other peopel as power
- trip toys
,
and the need to escape their power
. it
' s about a world where sex is nothing
and normal human values don
' t pertain
;
and the lack of sexual excitement
and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment
. an nc
- 17 movie which isn
' t sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness
and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty
, power
, or value
. the noe scene in the movie that
* could
* have been a good sex scene
, berkley
and maclachlan in a swimming pool
, is not exciting
, because by
then we already know his carachter is a callous manipulator
. if anything
, it
' s a rape scene with a victim who
' s been duped inot cooperation
. you don
' t make a movie about the history of black people in amercia without using a few black actors
; you don
' t make a movie about world war ii without a fewd guns going off
and a few people getting killed
;
and you don
' t make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls
.
.
.
and in an awful lot of vegas shows
, an awful lot of ladies mear very little clothing
. this is a legitimate protrayal of a rether seamy side of the entertainment inudstry
, in a town where sex isnt simply a negotiable commodity
. showgirls de
- glamorizes the las vegas sohw
and sex industries with great effectiveness
. nomi is played
, in a very good performance
, by elizabeth berkley
, who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents who
' s at the end of her rope
, desperate to live a life better than the one she
' s known
. she has nothing tothe market exept her body
and her limited dancing ability
,
and is trying desperately not to tothe be a hooker
, trying to be something better than she seems destinde to be
. when nomi realizes she
' s gone too far for too little
, she catches herself just in time to save hte most essential part of who she wants to be
. gina rivera plays molly
, a dressmaker
and costumer who befriends nomi
, providing her with what may be teh one solid
, positive relationship in nomi
' s entire life
. molly is the one who makes the difference
, annd provides the role model anbd framework nomi needs tothe verify the value system she
' ll be using for the rest of her life
, adn nomi
' s feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomi
' s decission
. gina gershon plays cristal
, an aging
,
but still very attractive starring dancer
, a reflexively competitive manipulator who
' s become a villainess by internalizing the ethos ofthe the crooks annd scum around her
. gershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner
and raquel welch
; a fading talent made bitter by self
- awareness
. her character is very well drawn
and performed
; in a major scene in a hospital room
, she acknowledges whta she is
,
and
, inspite essence
, passes the torch to nomi
. the relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie
,
and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path
. it is no accident that the three importamt parts iin this movie are women ofthe different stripe
; molly is an honest
, hard
- working person who means well
,
and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter
and the image with reality
. cristal is a talented dancer who
' s compromised her ideals
and sold herself to be a co
- operating part of the system
, exchanging self
- respect for tjhe species of stardom that can be had in las vegas
. nomi believes she can make it without selling herself
, succumbs to a degree
,
and
then realizes she can mkea it without selling herself
,
and doesn
' t need las vegas or its br
and of
" stardom
.
" the male parts in this movie are simply props
; they exist only to demonstrate
and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist
. kyle maclachlan
, whose single best previous work wass as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden
, gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum onthe two legs
, camouflaged as a nice guy
. glenn plummer plays a dancer who
' s wokring as a bellboy
,
and provides a bit of alternate perspective
. plummer
' s character is the only one in the movei who
' s maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art
, bu even he
' s succumbed to the cult of manipulation
. plummer
' s character is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole movie
. some of jost vacano
' s cinematography is fantastic
,
and one particular delineation of nomi
' s character alteration
, a no
- dialog scene using nothing
but color changes in the lighting
, is utterly terrifying
. this movie is rated nc
- 17 due to language
, sexual situations
, full frontal nudity
, violence
, adn probablly the costuming as well
. i don
' t see a way htis particular story could have been told well without it
,
and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in movie
- making
.
but don
' t go see it if you
' re not inaddition a tough mood
; the only person it
' s possible tothe like in this movei ends up in an i
. c
. u
. on life support
,
and there is probablly not one character in this movie you
' d enjoy meeting in person
