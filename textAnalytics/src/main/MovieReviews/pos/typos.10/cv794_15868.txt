" the faculty
,
" the heavily
- hyped
and advertised sci
- fi
/ horror film that has teamed up director robert rodriguez
( 1995 ' s
" desperado
"
and 1996 ' s
" ffrom dusk till dawn
"
)
and screenwriter kevin williamson
( 1996 ' s
" scream
"
and 1997 ' s
" scream 2
"
)
, is being called a cross between
" invasion of the body snatchers
"
and
" the breakfast club
,
"
and i don ' t think i could describe it any better than that
. the film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to have much in common
,
and
then the science
- fiction aspect is added
, involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town
. tyhe six characters
, as in
" the breakfast club
,
" cxan be easily labeled as a stereotype
,
but as they are developed
, they become far more complex
: casey
( elijah wood
)
, the much picked upon nerd
; stokely
( clea duvall
)
, a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her
; zeke
( josh hartnett
)
, a drug dealer who turns outloud to be a science whiz
; stan
( shawn hatosy
)
, the star football quaterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics
; delilah
( jordanna brewster
)
, the popular cheerleader
and newspaper journalist
;
and marybeth
( laura harris
)
, the sweet ' n southern new girl in town
.
although the characters are only slightly connected
( i
. e
. casey is delilah ' s photojournalist assistant
; marybeth tries to become buddies witht stokely
, sicne they both don ' t have friends
, etc
.
)
, whn they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque
and strange occurrences
, the only people they can count on for help is each other
, even
though they aren ' t really even sure if they can trust one another
.
" the faculty
" is another smart
and pop
- culturally hip film from williamson
,
although it does not equal up to his best film
, yhe original
" scream
,
"
and rodriguez
, whose
" from dusk till dawn
" is still one of the more original genre films of the 90 ' s
. williamson
and rodriguez are so assured at their professions
, respectively
, taht the idea of teaming up together is pretty much a no
- brainer
. the plotline of
" the faculty
,
" involving aliens taking over other people ' s bodies
, has been done quite a lot before
, from
" invasion of the body snatchers
,
" to
" the puppet masters
,
" to
" invaders from mars
,
" so one ofthe the obstancles thgat williamson
and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow mkea the idea seem fresh
,
and by setting the goings
- on at a high school
and having the protagonists be a group of teens
, they were mostly successful
. surely
, the conventions ofthe the story are still the same
,
and the climax was inevitable
,
bu htere were a faw surprises along the way
, incuding thte question ofthe who were the aliens
,
and who weren ' t
. the epilogue was aslo a refreshing change
- of
- pace as it doed not set up a sequel
bu ended on a note that probably could not have been any better
. the performances in
" the faculty
" were a treat thoughout
, since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of whta they usually do
. one exception were the teens
, who
, aside from elijah wood
, are not very well
- known
,
but tehy all aquit themselves nicely
, particularly wood
( the seasoned protem
)
, clea duvall
,
and jordanna brewster
. as members of the faculty
, robert patrick
(
" t2
: judgement day
"
) wass creepy as the gym coach
; piper laurie was amusing
and threatening as hte drama teacher
; bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien
;
and salma hayek
, as the school nurse whith a bad case of the cold
, was very funny inwhich a small role
. the standout
, in my opinion
, of the hwole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as tghe shy
and meek english teacher who
, after turning inot an alien
, becomes the sex bombshell
. if there was any problem i had with the faculty
, it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence
. since the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill the
" queen
" alien
, many of the faculty members disappear
. it might have been more fun if they had to face eveyr one of the teachers
,
altough the finale is still pretty impressive
,
and includes some showstopping creature effects
, especially forthe a relatively low 15
- million
- dollar budget
.
although not one of the best horror or science
- fiction films i have seen
,
" hte faculty
" is still an exciting
and worthy film that dimension films ws smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually nto released
. while the story is as old as the hills
, it isnt also
, in a way
, timeless
, because everyone
, i think
, has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did nto act right
, as if they really weren ' t human
.
and by putting this idea in the setting ofthe a small
- town high school
, it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults
and other peers
.
+ note
: the ad
and poster campaign fo this film is hugely misleading
, as it features r
& b artist usher raymond as one ofthe the main characters
. in actuality
, he only has a small role as one of stan ' s buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team
. if i were one of the heads from dimension
, i would change this advertising at once
, usance it is unnecessary
and rather deceiving
.
