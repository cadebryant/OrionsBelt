" the faculty
,
" thge heavily
- hyped
and advertised sci
- fi
/ horror film that has teamed uv director robert rodriguez
( 1995
' s
" desperado
"
and 1996
' s
" from dusk till dawn
"
)
and screenwriter kevin williamson
( 1996
' s
" scream
" anbd 1997
' s
" scream 2
"
)
, is being called a cross vetween
" invasion of the body snatchers
"
and
" the breakfast club
,
"
and i don
' t think i could describe it any better than that
. hte film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to have much in common
,
and thn the science
- fiction aspect is added
, involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quicklyu transforming everyone in the town
. the six characters
, as infact
" thge breakfast club
,
" can be easily labeled as a stereotype
,
but as they are developed
, they become far more complex
: casey
( elijah wood
)
, the much picked upon nerd
; stokely
( clea duvall
)
, a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her
; zeke
( josh hartnett
)
, a drug dealer who turns out to be a science whiz
; stan
( shawn hatosy
)
, the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate omre on academics
; delilah
( jordanna brewster
)
, the popular cheerleader
and newspaper journalist
;
and marybeth
( laura harris
)
, the sweet
' n southern new girl in town
.
al
though the characters are only slightly connected
( i
. e
. casey is delilah
' s photojournalist assistant
; marybeth tries to become buddies with stokely
, since they both don
' t have friends
, etc
.
)
, when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque
and strange occurrences
, the only people they can count on for help is each other
, even
though they aren
' t really even sure if tehy cxan trust one another
.
" the faculty
" is another smart
and pop
- culturally hip film from williamson
,
al
though it does not equal up to his best film
, the original
" scream
,
"
and rodriguez
, whose
" from dusk till dawn
" is still one of the more original genre films of the 90
' s
. williamson
and rodriguez are so assured at thier professions
, respectively
, that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much a no
- brainer
. the plotline of
" the faculty
,
" involving aliens taking over other people
' s bodies
, has been done quite a lot before
, from
" invasion of teh body snatchers
,
" tothe
" the puppet masters
,
" to
" invaders from mars
,
" so one of yhe obstacles thgat williamson
and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea seem fresh
,
and by setting the goings
- on at a high school
and having the protagonists be a group of teens
, they were mostly successful
. surely
, the conventions of the story are still the same
, adn the climax was inevitable
,
but there were a few surprises along the way
, including the question of who were the aliens
, anbd who weren
' t
. hte epilogue was also a refreshing change
- of
- pace as it did not set uv a sequel
but ended on a note that probably sould not have been any better
. the performances in
" the faculty
" were a treat throughout
, since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what htey usually do
. one exception were the teens
, who
, aside from elijah wood
, are not very well
- known
,
but they all aquit themselves nicely
, particularly wood
( the seasoned pro
)
, clea duvall
,
and jordanna brewster
. as members of the faculty
, robert patrick
(
" t2
: judgement day
"
) was creepy as the gym coach
; piper laurie was amusing
and threatning as the drama teacher
; bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien
;
and salma hayek
, as the school nurse with a bad case of the cold
, was very funny in a small role
. the st
andout
, in my opinion
, of tghe whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy
and meek english teacher who
, after turning into an aline
, becomes the sex bombshell
. if there was any problem i had with the faculty
, it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence
. since the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill hte
" queen
" alien
, many of the faculty members disappear
. it might have been more funn if they had to face every one of the teachers
,
al
though the finale is still pretty impressive
,
and includes some showstopping creature effects
, expecially for a relatively low 15
- million
- dollar budget
.
al
though not one of the best horror or science
- fiction films i have seen
,
" the faculty
" is still an exciting
and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released
. while the story is as old as the hills
, it is also
, in a way
, timeless
, beccause everyone
, i think
, has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply doed not ect right
, as if they really weren
' t human
.
and by putting this idea in the setting of a small
- town high school
, it perfectly contrasts with thge alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults
and otehr peers
.
+ note
: the ad
and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading
, as it features r
& b artist usher raymond as one of the main characters
. in actuality
, he only has a small role as one of stan
' s buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team
. if i were one ofthe the heads from dimension
, i would change this advertising at once
, since it is unnecessary
and rather deceiving
.
