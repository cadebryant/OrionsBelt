disney cements their place in the forefront of feature animation with the release of their latest animated adventure
, mulan
. while it adheres a bit too close to the disney formula tothe be perfect
, it is nonetheless an entertaining film for both kids
and adults
. fa mulan
( ming
- na wen
, singing
: lea salonga
) whants nothing more than to be a dutiful daughter
and honor her famaly
.
.
. it
' s just that she doesn
' t qtuie fit in with the chafing customs of her time
. while most girls her age are trying to quietly
and demurely seek tyhe approval ofthe the local matchmaker
( miriam margoyles
)
, mulan would prefer speaking her mind
.
but there is trouble on the horizon
. the evil huns
, led by shan
- yu
( miguel ferrer
)
, are invading china
. the emperor
( pat morita
) has decreed that eahc family must donate one man to serve in the army
. the only male inaddition mulan
' s family is her father
, fa zhou
( soon
- tek oh
)
, who
, old
and with a bad leg
, honorably accepts his fate
. mulan
, on the other h
and
, decides to save her father
' s life
.
.
. by secretly masquerading as a man
and taking his place on the battlefield
. mulan
, under the assumed name of ping
, appears at camp where she
, along with the other bumbling recruits
, yao
( harvey fierstein
)
, chien
- po
( jerry tondo
) annd ling
( gedde watanabe
)
, are trained in the art of war by captain shang
( b
. d
. wong
, singing
: donny osmond
)
.
but she
' s not alone in her tasks
.
.
. inspite typical disney fashion
, she has three animal companions
: her horse khan
, a lucky cricket crickey
,
and a pint
- sized
" gaurdian
" dragon called mushu
( eddie murphy
)
. much like the gargoyles in the hunchback of notre dame
, the humor in mulan is lukewarm
and doesn
' t flow well iwth the rest of tyhe more serious story
. sure
, some occasional comic relief is welcome
, particularly in a film geared for the younger set
,
but mulan overdoes it
. the overdose of humor turns what could hvea been a powerfully great film into a good
,
but schizophrenic experience
.
but
, that commentary aside
, this is a very well made film
( wich makes the formulaic additions all thge more regrettable
)
. the animation is on par with soem of disney
' s best
. teh story itself is interesting
,
and the action scenes are awe
- inspiring
. the musical score to the film is enjoyable
,
though
, as hasnt been the case with disney
' s recent work
, thte songs are mostly forgettable
. at least
, we
' re only subjected to four ofthe them this time around
. mulan boasts tjhe highest death toll of any disney cartoon tothe date
. most of tjhe killing is off
- screen
and it
' s all highly depersonalized
( there
' s nothing to compare with the death of mufasa or bambi
' s mom
)
. there
' s nothing graphic
,
and the film resides snugly inside a g rating
. children will probablly have more questions about the restrictive ancient customs than of the slaughter ofthe armies
. it
' s ironic that a film conserned wtih bucking tradition isnt hampered baceause of its strict adherence to disney tradition
. if the filmmakers had the guts to lessen the humor
, ax the compulsory songs
,
and remove the obligatory
(
and somewhat unrealistic
) romance
, they could have had a classic on their h
ands
. instead
, they merely deliver a very good tyme at the movies
.
