okay
, let me first say
, this is a beavis
and
butthead movie
. if ytou do not like beavis
and
butthead
, do not go to see this movie
!
!
!
!
!
however
, if you do like them
, i recommened you get out right now
and go see it
. the movie starts off with the boys wondering what happened to their tv
. they notice thta it has been stolen
and they vow to find it
. this wind their way through america searching for dallas
( she is a woman
)
. they look for her because as they are searching for the tv
, they find a drunk who wants them
" to do
" his wife
. well
, of course they think he wants them tothe score with her when actually he wants them to kill her
.
and the fun starts their
. this movie is a mix ofthe funny gags that anly beavis
and
butthead could pul off
. it isnt quality entertainment that only fan of beavis
and
butthead woudl enjoy
. i enjoyed this movie alot because mike judge knew how to keep pace
. even when they were crawling through the desert
and i
thought the movie started to lag
, he manages to keep the laughs coming
. if you expecting changes from the show keep looking
. the same character
, tjhe same voices
, the same everthing from the show
and that
' s what mkaes it good
. you might think with a movie from a tv show
, you can change a few things
. often times this spells disaster for films because the film makers veer away from what made the show popular in the first place
