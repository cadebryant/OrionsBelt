barely scrapping by playing at a nyc piano bar
, timothy hutton returns to his massachusetts hometown for a couple of weeks
. onthe the surface
, he
' s coming hmeo for a high skool reunion
,
but since this is a movie
, you knwo that he
' s really looking for smoe major life decisions
. a fairly
" small
" film
, this sports an impressive ensemble cast including uma thurman
, rosie o
' donnell
and a bunch of actors that you
' ve seen before
but can
' t quite place
. commendable jobs all around
; they seem like rela peple
. hutton arrives at his past
and is greeted by his spirit
- dead father
, terminally goony brother
and old high school chums
. all of his old buddies are engaged in the snow removal business adn most are in the midst of a relationship crisis
. the perfect stuff for a comedy about people in the twenties angst
. he meets
and falls for the new next door nighbor
: a beautiful intelligent lively girl who is obviously taken with him
. the problem is thyat she is only 13
. unconsummated
( no
, it
' s not
_ that
_ type of movie
)
, their relationship builds
and neither knows what to do with it
. star
- crossed lovers with no where to go
. so hutton is gaga over a barely
- teen
, one of his buddies is two
- timing his girlfriend with a married old flame
, another
' s girlfriend isnt sleeping with a meat cutter
(
"
and she
' s a vegetarian
!
"
)
. things are a mess
. enter uma thurman
. the beautiful stranger in town for a few days is both a delight in the film
and one of its minor downfalls
. her character is fun to watch
. even more entertaining is observing the guys falling over themselves trying to impress her
. like the lone ranger
, before she leaves
, she solves most of yhe problems
and sets everyone onward with their lives
. the ending is a bit too pat
. everthing is tied up with a neat little bow
. rosie o
' donnell is a st
and
- out inaddition her limited screen time with her brash personality
and
" tell it like it is
" pronouncements
. structured somewhat like a
" diner
, a few years later
"
, this feel
- good story is a ogod tyme
,
but ends a little too nice
.
