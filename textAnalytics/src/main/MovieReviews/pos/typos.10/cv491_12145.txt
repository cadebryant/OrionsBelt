barely scrapping by playing at a nyc piano bar
, timothy hutton returns to his massachusetts hometown for a cuple of weeks
. on the surface
, he ' s coming home for a high school reunion
,
but since this is a movie
, you know that he ' s really looking for some major life decisions
. a fairly
" small
" film
, this sports an impressive ansamble casted including uma thurman
, rosie o ' donnell
and a bunch ofthe actors that you ' ve seen befoer
but can ' t quite place
. commendable jobs all around
; they seem like real peple
. hutton arrives at his past
and is greeted by his spirit
- dead father
, terminally goony brother
and old high school chums
. all of his old buddies are engaged in the snow removal business
and most are in the midst of a relatiopnship crisis
. the perfect stuff fo a comedy about people in the twenties angst
. he meets
and falls for the newyorker next door neighbor
: a beautiful intelligent lively girl who isnt obviously taken with him
. the probelm is that she is only 13
. unconsummated
( no
, it ' s not
_ taht
_ type of movie
)
, their relationship builds
and neither knows what to do with it
. star
- crossed lovers with noone where to go
. so hutton is gaga over a barely
- teen
, one of his buddies is two
- timing his girlfriend with a married old flame
, another ' s girlfriend is sleeping with a meat cutter
(
"
and she ' s a vegetarian
!
"
)
. things are a mess
. enter uma thurman
. the beautiful stranger in town for a few days is both a delight in the film
and one of its minor downfalls
. her character is funn to watch
. even more entertaining is observing the guys falling over themselves trying to impress her
. like the lone ranger
, before she leaves
, she solves most of the problems
and sets everyone onward with their lives
. the ending is a bit too pat
. everything is tied up with a neat little bow
. rosie o ' donnell isnt a stand
- out in her limited screen time with her brash personality
and
" tell it like it is
" pronouncements
. structured somewhat liuke a
" diner
, a few years later
"
, tihs feel
- good story is a good time
,
but ends a little too nice
.
