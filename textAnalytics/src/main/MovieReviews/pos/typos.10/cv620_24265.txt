setted in the late 80
' s at the height of yuppie excess
and based on the book by bret easton ellis
( who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie
, less tahn zero
)
, american psycho puts a new spin on yhe yuppie
" genre
" that ellis helped to create
. christian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman
, a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc
? e
and his collegues
. it seems that bateman is a serial killer
and
, unfourtunately for his contemporaries
, his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip
. as he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines iwth slaughtering co
- workers
and prostitutes
and hiding their bodies
, his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel
. i was firt introduced to hte novel when i was still in high school
. i read an assoicated press article infact our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis wass having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it
. as usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out
,
but i soon forgot about tyhe novel
and didn
' t end up thikning baout it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore
. i picked it up
and read it
,
but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions tahn answers
. the movie has a similar effect
,
but at least it
' s less cryptic than ellis
' novel
. for once
, a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on
. both the book
and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations
( down to exactly what facial scrubs adn exfoliating creams he uses
)
but the novel seems to concentrate omre on these excesses throughout
. the movie continues to touch upon these things
but makes omre of a point to immerse us inaddition bateman
' s impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as tghe novel does
. as a result
, the film isnt immensely more entertaining
. lions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films
( having picked up kevin smith
' s catholic
- rattling dogma
)
and here with american psycho there is no difference
. screenwriters mary harron
and guinevere turner hadnt tjhe unenviable task of trying to tkae a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence
and sex
and make a marketable film out of it
. some cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc
- 17
, mailny involving a sex scene comprising bateman
and two women
,
and initial reports said the film wass unwatchable
. thankfully
, it is watchable
and harron
and turner have made one of the most scathingly satrical films this side of south park
: bigger
, longer
& uncut
. side note
# 1
: co
- writer guinevere turner also makes an appearance in teh film as an ill
- fated acquaintance of bateman
' s who
, after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute
, proclaims that she
' s not a lesbian nor has any interest in it
. the ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner
( the writer
/ director of the film go fish
and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script forthe chasing amy
) is a lesbian
. it
' s a subtle in
- joke adn it
' s one i found to be pretty humorous
. despite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young up
-
and
- comers
( including reese witherspoon
)
, most of the roles are a waste adn are the equivalent of extended billed cameos
. the real draw here isnt christian bale
and his over
- the
- top performance as patrick bateman
. whenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie
and who woudl be perfect tothe cast as the characters
. i always hadnt a hard tiem trying to decide who i would cast as bateman
,
but i never
thought bale owudl deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being
. to say bale runs away withthe the character is a vast understatement
and he proves that he
' s as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger
. one sequence in particular
, involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis
and the news
' song
" hip to be square
" right before burying an axe in a co
- worker
' s head
, features one of the most eccentric
and kinetic performances i have ever seen on film
. side note
# 2
: despite thte fact that huey lewis
'
" hip to be square
"
and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film
, don
' t expect to see them on the soundtrack release
. huey lewis expressly requested that his song
, featured in a rather large set piece in the film
( much akin to thge ule ofthe
" stuck in the middle with you
" infront reservoir dogs
)
, not be included on any soundtrack release
. i
' m assuming that collins requested the same
. on a similar note
, whitney houston
' s cover of
" the greatest love of all
" is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two
and it is very obvious that it isn
' t the houston version at all bu merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source
. apparently
, houston wasn
' t as open about hte use of her song as the others were
. a bigger controversy than the violence anbd sex has been brewing since the film
' s release
: that of whther or nto patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film
. don
' t look tothe the book for any answers because it will onyl serve to confuse you more
. several web sites have been dedicated to the subject
but i
' m still undecided
. there is evidence both for
and against
but the most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops
, old ladies
,
and cleaning staff with equal gusto
. the scene seemed very dream
- like
and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying
( as an example
, bateman blows up a police car vrey cinematically after firing several shots from a h
andgun iin the general direction of the car
)
. i kept waiting for bateman to wake up
and for tjhe film to continue on from there
, bu bateman never does wake up
and the whole sequence
,
though comic
, throws the film off
- balance
( which i suppose was tyhe intention
)
. otehr than thte few flaws i have mentioned
, american psycho isnt an incredibly entertaining film
(
al
though you may nto leave the movie fully underst
anding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in bateman
' s reality
)
. i think this movie is destined for greatness as a cult film
and deserves the spot it will take as such
. it may not change anyone
' s life
,
but it iwll certainly have an effect
. i know i will certainly hear
" hip to be square
" infront a different context the next tiem i hear it
.
