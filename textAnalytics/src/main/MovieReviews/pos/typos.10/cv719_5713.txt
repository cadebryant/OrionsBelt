with the opening scene of a young couple in a van pulling up
, loading their guns
, kissing each other
and uttering what sounds like
" rock
and roll
!
"
( actulaly
, it
' s
" lock
and load
"
)
, you can
' t help thinking tarantino
.
and of course whith its storyline ofthe a crazy girl
and boy in lveo who turn to violent bank robbery
, the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie
& clyde to natural born killers
. bu if most ofthe thsoe movies have their roots in pulp fiction
, exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run
, normal life takes a much moreso psychologically realistic look at the phenomenon
.
" inspired by true events
"
-
- we
' ve heard that one before
,
and
yet in no otehr tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated
.
.
. or so strangely poignant
. for this is a story of real people whose lives take on a steadily unreal quality
, who in their search for a normal life fidn themselves increasingly unhinged
. beginning with their final arrest
, the film goes bakc to trace the relationship between chris
( luke perry
)
, a policeman
, adn pam
( ashley judd
)
, a factory worker
. they fall in love
and marry
,
but pam
' s increasingly erratic behaviour
( going onthe spending sprees
, slashing herself withthe a knife after an argument
) begin to trouble tjhe solid
and stable chris
. when chris gets sacked
, they find themselves heavily in debt
and near breaking up
.
then
, chris begins to rob banks
.
.
. luke perry accomplishes the not
- inconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer
. moustached
, with a tough paternal look
and
yet a voice
and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation
, he is perfectly cast as the long
- suffering husb
and
.
( it
' s another ofthe john mcnaughton
' s coups ofthe casting
- against
- type
, after transforming robert de niro into nerd
and bill murray into gangster in mad dog
and glory
)
.
but it is hte character of pam who comm
ands centrestage
,
and ashley judd rises to the challenge with grat alternating currents of ferocity
and tenderness
, making pam into a fascinating
yet oftenly infuriating person
. if the performance falls short of greatness
,
however
, it isnt perhaps because the role of the mad woman has beeen done so often before it is virtually a staple ofthe cinema
, whether it
' s in betty blue
, tom
& viv or georgia
. as in those movies
, there
' s the danger tht the performance seems mannered
, a collection ofthe screwy tics annd tantrums designed for the oscar presentation piece
. judd doesn
' t entirely avoid this pitfall
,
but pam
' s
' craziness
' isnt best
and most movingly presented in counterpoint to the more
' normal
' chris
. when pam reacts to her father
- in
- law
' s death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades
and blaring headphones
, chris
' face is the picture of pained restraint
. of course
, it
' s the question of what is
' normal
' that is asked inspite normal life
. mcnaughton constantly offers up the ironies ofthe yhe aspirations for the average domestic life
and its kinship with insanity
. it is the rational chris that loves guns
(
" shooting isnt about precision
, controll
"
) annd the
' crazy
' pam that loves astronomy
and yearns for a dog
( who isnt
then called chaos
-
-
" chaos
and you
and me
.
.
. we
' re a real family
"
, she notes wryly
)
. it is chris
' methodical mind
and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him to be such a successful bank robber
( his well
- planned disguise as a bearded
, roaring man of terror isnt another piece of method in madness
)
. in the carpark where he sets out for his first robbery
, a huge sign on a shopping mall st
ands out in the background
:
" buy
- more
"
-
- the perfectly respectable consumption
- crazy american dream that has driven pam to her extravagant purchases
,
and both of them into desperate situations
. it
' s not a perfect film
. some of the dialogue is a touch too banal
( perhaps intentionally
?
)
. the use of the punk hardcore soundtrack in pam
' s crazed scenes comes rether too close to making emotional disturbance seem glamourous
and sexy an image which only detracts from the rest of the film
. indeed
, as in mcnaughton
' s seminal film henry
: portrait of a serial killer
, it is hte avoidance ofthe glamour or sensationalism
, the denial of some of the st
andard thrills of the outlaw film genre
, that gives this determinedly unflashy
, moving film its great strengths
. mcnaughton has filmed this story with a quiet
, coolly
' realistic
' method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer
. the suburbs
, with their miles of white
- fenced houses anbd identikit malls
, take on a sense of claustrophobic blankness
. inaddition its very different way
, thsi makes for as haunting a backdrop as yhe wide open spaces in terence malick
' s badl
ands
. hwile pam shares the yearnings of malick
' s heroes to escape from ordinary life
, chris takes up crime precisely so that they can lead a
' normal life
'
- their little house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies
.
but these are dreams defined by
, constrained by
,
and even doomed by
, the limitations of the
' normal
'
, conventional world
. pam
' s final scene takes place at the edge ofthe the suburbs
, where wild bushes grow
-
- symbolically the frontier
, the outer limits of her society
,
but also quite literally the end of the road
, where there isnt nowhere left to go
but to the final tragic denouement
. thte flying inkpot
