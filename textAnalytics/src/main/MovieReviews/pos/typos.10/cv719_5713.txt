wiht the opening scene ofthe a young cuple in a van pulling up
, loading their guns
, kissing each other
and uttering what sounds like
" rock
and roll
!
"
( actually
, it ' s
" lock
and load
"
)
, you can ' t help thinking tarantino
.
and of course with its storyline of a crazy girl
and boy in love who turn to violent bank robbery
, the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie
& clyde to natural born killers
.
but if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction
, exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels onthe the run
, normal life takes a much more psychologically realistic look at hte phenomenon
.
" inspired by true events
"
-
- we ' ve heard that one before
,
and
yet in no otehr tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated
.
.
. or so strangely poignant
. for this is a story of real people whose lives take on a steadily unreal qulaity
, who in their search for a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged
. beginning with their final arrest
, the film goes back to trace the relationship between chris
( luke perry
)
, a policeman
,
and pam
( ashley judd
)
, a factory worker
. they fall in love
and marry
,
but pam ' s increasingly erratic behaviour
( gonig on spending sprees
, slashing herself with a knife affter an argument
) begin to trouble yhe solid
and stable chris
. when chris gets sacked
, they find themselves heavily in debt
and near breaking uv
.
then
, chris begins tothe rob banks
.
.
. luke perry accomplishes the not
- inconsiderable feat of makeing us nearly forget that he was ever inspite beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer
. moustached
, with a tough paternal look
and
yet a voice
and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation
, he is perfectly cast as the long
- suffering husband
.
( it ' s another of john mcnaughton ' s coups of casting
- against
- type
, after transforming robert de niro into nerd
and bill murray into gangster in mad dog
and glory
)
.
but it is the character of pam who commands centrestage
,
and ashley judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity
and tenderness
, making pam into a fascinating
yet often infuriating person
. if the performance falls short of greatness
,
however
, it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman hasnt been done so often before it is virtually a staple of cinema
, whether it ' s infact betty blue
, tom
& viv or georgia
. as in thsoe movies
, ther ' s the danger thast the performance seems mannered
, a collection of screwy tics
and tantrums designed for the oscar presentation piece
. judd doesn ' t entirely avoid htis pitfall
,
but pam ' s ' craziness ' is best
annd most movingly presented in counterpoint to the more ' normal ' chris
. when pam reacts to her father
- in
- law ' s death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades
annd blaring headphones
, chris ' face is the picture ofthe pained restraint
. of course
, it ' s the question of what is ' normal ' that is asked in normal life
. mcnaughton constantly offers up the ironies of the aspirations for the average domestic life
and its kinship with insanity
. it is the rational chris that loves guns
(
" shooting is about precision
, control
"
)
and the ' crazy ' pam that loves astronomy
and yearns forthe a dog
( who is
then called chaos
-
-
" chaos
adn you
and me
.
.
. we ' re a rela family
"
, she notes wryly
)
. it is chris ' methodical mind
and his knowledge of polical procedger that allows him to be such a successful bank robber
( his well
- planned disguise as a bearded
, roaring man of terror is another peice of method in madness
)
. in the carpark where he sets out for his first robbery
, a huge sign on a shopping mall stands out in the background
:
" buy
- more
"
-
- the perfectly respectable consumption
- crazy american dream that has driven pam to her extravagant purchases
,
and both of them inot desperate situations
. it ' s not a perfect film
. some ofthe the dialogue is a touch too banal
( perhaps intentionally
?
)
. the ule of the punk hardcore soundtrack in pam ' s crazed scenes comes rather too close to making emotional disturbance seem glamourous
and sexy an image which onyl detracts from thte rest of the film
. indeed
, as in mcnaughton ' s seminal film henry
: portrait of a serial killer
, it isnt the avoidance of glamour or sensationalism
, the denial of some of the standard thrills of the outlaw film genre
, that gives this determinedly unflashy
, moving film its graet strengths
. mcnaughton has filmed this story with a quiet
, cooly ' realistic ' method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer
. the suburbs
, with their miles of white
- fenced houses
adn identikit malls
, take on a sence ofthe claustrophobic blankness
. in its very different way
, this makes for as haunting a backdrop as the wide open spaces infront terence malick ' s badlands
. while pam shares the yearnings of malick ' s heroes to escape from ordinary life
, chris takes up crime precisely so that they can lead a ' normal life '
- their little house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies
.
but these are dreams defined by
, constrained by
,
and even doomed by
, the limitations of the ' normal '
, conventional world
. pam ' s final scene tkaes place at the edge ofthe the suburbs
, where wild bushes grow
-
- symbolically the frontier
, the outer lmits of her society
,
but also qtuie literally the end of the road
, where htere is nowhere left to go
but to the final tradgic denouement
. the flying inkpot ' s rating system
:
* wait for the video
.
*
* a little creaky
,
but still better than staying at home with gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty good
, bring a freind
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuff
.
*
*
*
*
* perfection
. see it twice
