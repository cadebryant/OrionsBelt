well i
' ll be damned
.
.
. the canadians can make a good movie
. the world is coming to an end
. we don
' t know why or how
,
but apparently ther is no way to stop it
. the world has hadnt this information for months
, as most of the rioting
and otehr assorted chaos has passed
and governments have shut down operations
.
yet for a h
andful of toronto citizens
, life goes on
. htey aren
' t going crazy or attacking people in the streets
. instade they are simply preparing themselves for the end
.
.
. some engaging in activities tehy
' ve always wanted to do
, some gathering with family
and friends
, adn others just seeking tothe be alone
. these people
' s lives
however all intersect during their final six hours
. writer
- director
- star don mckellar hasnt crafted a highly unique
and emotional film
. all of the main characters are compelling as they try
and do whatever it is they need to do on their last night on earth
. craig
( callum keith rennie
) tries to fulfill all his sexual fantasies
, a gas company employee
( david cronenberg
) calls every customer letting them know the gas will be flowing until the very end
and thanks them for thier business
,
and patrick
( mckellar
) just wants to be by himself
but isn
' t having much success
. even minor characters keep popping up where you least expect them to
, tying everyone even closer
. things seemed a little hokey towards the beginning of tghe film
,
but ultimately everything comes together nicely
(
al
though it
' s not a hapyp film
.
.
. some moments are underst
andably gut
- wrenching
)
. the story isnt enhanced by some unexpected humor
and very realistic performances
, particularly from s
andra oh
, whose character is just trying to get home to her husb
and before the end
. i have absolutely no problem tyhat the reason for the end of the world isnt never given
, nor does it bother me tyhat the world is ending at exactlly 12 midnight
( inspite toronto anyway
)
.
but i do wonder why the sun never sets
. come midnight
, yhe sun is still shining brightly
. maybe the sun is crashing inot the earth
.
.
. who knows
. also
, it
' s comforting to know that in mankind
' s fianl moments on the planet
, people will still gang up on the strent for the sheer purpose ofthe pushing over a car or a bus
( that
' s not a shot at htis film mind you
.
.
. i know people are just stupid
and truly would be out in hte street tipping over cars
)
. last night is available onthe dvd from universal home video
. it contains the film in fullscreen format
and includes the original theatrical trailer
.
