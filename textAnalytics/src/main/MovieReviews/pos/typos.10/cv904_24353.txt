well i ' ll be damned
.
.
. the canadians can make a good movie
. thte world is coming to an end
. we don ' t know why or how
,
but apparently there is no way to stop it
. the world has had this information for months
, as most of the rioting
and other assorted chaos has passed
and governments have shut down operations
.
yot for a handfull ofthe toronto citizens
, life goes on
. they aren ' t oging crazy or attacking people in the streets
. instead they are simply preparing themselfs fo the end
.
.
. some engaging in actvities they ' ve always wanted to do
, some gathering with family
and friends
,
and others just seeking to be alone
. these peopel ' s lives
however all intersect during their fianl six hours
. writer
- director
- star don mckellar has crafted a highly unique
and emotional film
. all of the main characters are compelling as they try
and dont whatever it is they need to do on their lsat night on earth
. craig
( callum keith rennie
) trys tothe fulfill all his sexual fantasies
, a gas company employee
( david cronenberg
) calls every customer letting them know the gas iwll be flowing until the very end
adn thanks them for their business
,
and patrick
( mckellar
) just wants to be by himself
but isn ' t having much succsess
. even minor cahracters keep popping up where you least expect them to
, tying everyone even closer
. things seemed a little hokey towards the beginning of tyhe film
,
bu ultimately everything comes together nicely
( altho it ' s not a happy film
.
.
. some moments are understandably gut
- wrenching
)
. thte story isnt enhanced by some unexpected humor
and very realistic performances
, particularly from sandra oh
, whose character is just trying to get home to her husban before the end
. i have absolutely no problem that tghe reason for the end of the world is never given
, nor does it bother me that the world is ending at exactly 12 midnight
( in toronto anyway
)
.
but i do wonder why the sun never sets
. come midnight
, the sun is still shining brightly
. mabey thte sun is crashing into the earth
.
.
. who knows
. also
, it ' s comforting to know that in mankind ' s final moments on the planet
, people will still gang up on the street for the sheer purpose of pushing over a car or a bus
( that ' s not a shot at htis film mind you
.
.
. i know people are just stupid
and truly would be out in the street tipping over cars
)
. last night is available on dvd from universal hmeo video
. it contains the film in fullscreen format
adn includes the original theatrical trailer
