you ' ve got mail is a timely romance for this impersonal
, computer
- driven decade
. two peple who ' ve never met confide in each other via e
- mail wihtout revealing their true identities
. nora ephron ' s contemporary update of tyhe shop around the corner retains the basic plot
: two people who despise each other unwittingly become enamored with each other through their anonymous correspondence
. ephron
, who co
- wrote the film with her sister
, delia
, as well as directed it
, knew whta she was doing by reteaming tom hanks
and meg ryan as the at
- odds couple
. ryan is kathleen kelly
, owner ofthe a small children ' s bookstore
, while hanks is joe fox
, who heads up a chain ofthe mega bookstores
( think barnes
& noble
)
. their charm
annd chemistry are the glue that binds this film
, even through some of the script ' s rough spots
. for the ephrons invested so much effort in their protagonists tath they give short shrift to thte talented supporting cast
, including parker posey
, greg kinnear
, jean stapleton
and steve zahn
.
yet no one is really going to complain because the ephrons konw their audeince
-
and what the paying public wants is hanks
and ryan
.
and the two are kept busy
. oney
, the other or both are inaddition nearly eveyr scene
. hanks has his decent guy routine down pat
,
yet each time he does it
, it seems effortless
, spontaneous
and fresh
. ryan smoothly moves between spunky
and vulnerable
, with a sexy touch of winsomeness added to the brew
. their scenes together sparkle
, even
though they lack teh nostalgic romanticism ofthe sleepless iin seattle
.
and the shadow of that earlier hit hangs over you ' ve got mail like dried
- uv mistletoe
. the sparks created by the earlier movie are
, by necessity
, not evident here
. true
, these are twpo people seeking true love
,
but you ' ve got mail is more comic
and less poignant tahn its predecessor
. the ephrons ' script is witty
and sharp
.
however
, as a director nora ephron is a bit uneven
. some scenes drag
, while others
, especially when hanks
and ryan are revealing their souls via e
- mail
, are crisp
and tidy
. also
, the scirpt gets sloppy towrad the end withthe characters merely disappearing from the story
. a nice
, romantic sountrack adds to this date
- night special
. overall
, you ' ve got mail is a lush
and cute outing
, taking advantage of the star appeal of its two leads
. it ' s a nice holiday movie
, one for holding hands
and snuggling
. committed to lifelong learning through effective communciation
