, who co
- wrote the film with her sister
, delia
, as well as directed it
, knew what she was doing by reteaming tom hanks
and meg ryan as the at
- odds couple
. ryan is kathleen kelly
, owner of a small children
' s bookstore
, while hanks is joe fox
, who heads up a chain ofthe mega bookstores
( think barnes
& noble
)
. their charm
and chemistry are the glue that binds this film
, even through some of the scirpt
' s rough spots
. for the ephrons invested so much effort in thier protagonists that they give short shrift to the talented supporting cast
, including parker posey
, greg kinnear
, jean stapleton
and steve zahn
.
yet no one is really going to complain because the ephrons konw their audeince
-
and what the paying public wants is hanks
and ryan
.
and the two are kept busy
. one
, the other or both are in nearly eveyr scene
. hanks has his decent guy routine down pat
,
yet each time he does it
, it seems effortless
, spontaneous annd fresh
. ryan smoothly moves between spunky
and vulnerable
, with a sexy touch of winsomeness added to the brew
. their scenes together sparkle
, even
though they lack the nostalgic romanticism of sleepless in seattle
.

' ve got mail like dried
- uv mistletoe
. the sparks created by the earlier movie are
, by necessity
, not evident here
. true
, these are two people seeking true love
,
but you
' ve got mail is more comic
and less poignant than its predecessor
. the ephrons
' script is witty annd sharp
.
however
, as a director nora ephron is a bit uneven
. some scenes drag
, while others
, especially when hanks
and ryan are revealing their souls via e
- mail
, are crisp
and tidy
. also
, the script gets sloppy toward the end with characters merely dissapearing from the story
. a nice
, romantic sountrack adds to this date
- inght special
. overall
, you
' ve got mail is a lush
and cute outing
, tkaing advantage ofthe thge star appeal of its two leads
. it
' s a nice holiday movie
, one for holding h
ands
and snuggling
. committed to lifelong learning through effective communication
