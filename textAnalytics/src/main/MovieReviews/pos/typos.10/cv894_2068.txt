, son
- infact
- law is the film tothe see this summer
. son
- in
- law is a great romantic comedy that should please the viewers
, especially fans of the wiez
. when son
- in
- law is long gone
and forgotten
, the blockbuster summer films will still be playing
and you will have a chance to see them
then
. this film could also make great video fare for those that are leery of spending seven dollars onthe it
. nothing will be lost by watching it on a television screen
.
al
though the basic story line hasnt beeen done many
, many times before
, the film is still fun to watch
. the laughs are plentiful
, especially when the wiez isnt around
. the way some of the jokes are done are new
, even
though some ofthe the jokes are old
. there are allso several new jokes that
, at least
, i haven
' t seen before
. still
, when presented right
, even old material can be funny still
. this film is just basically a light comedy that is great to see if you are in the right mood that doesn
' t contain much violentce or any nudity that is definitely worth full ticket price
. the cast for this film does an excellent job
. pauly shore
( encino man
) is the star attraction of this film
. he is great
,
and knows how tothe entertain the audiance
. pauly shore just seems to take over the entire screen when he is on witht expressions
and comments that are hilarious
. this film would definitely not have been as good with anyone else in this role
. carla gugino does a very good job as the farm girl gone city girl
. she makes her character believable
, onthe some levels
, yot intresting at thge same tiem
. the person who played tyhe gr
andfather
( mason adams
, i believe
) also does a great job
. the way he delivered his lines kept me laughing throughout the tiem that he was on the screen
. patrick renna
, who played gugino
' s littel brother
, was a little annoying
,
but no where as near as macaulay culkin
,
and for only part of the time
, so i can forgive him
. tiffani
- amber thiessen
( a killer among friends
,
" saved by yhe bell
"
) does a reasonably good job for the time that she is on screen
. she shows that she may have a potential in movies if she can get out of the corny young adults programming on television
. she wasn
' t given overly much tothe do in the film
,
but what she had
, she does a good job with
.
