no marter what you suspect

' t your usual action thriller
. the usual suspects is an intelligent crime mystery story from up
-
and
- coming director bryan singer
. it
' s oen of those movies that
, after everthing is revealed repid
- fire at the end
, you emmediately wanna tothe rewind
and watch again because earlier scenes take on a new light
. plot twists a
- go
- go are what you git here
-
- i gave up trying to figure out the mystery of keyser soze after awhile
and just sat back
and waited for them to reveal it to me
. keyser soze is a name you
' ll hear at least a hundred times if you watch the usual suspects
and for good reason
. it
' s not only the nmae of the mysterious
(
and possibly even mythical
) crime boss in the movie
, it also sums up thge movie

" keyser soze
" in latin means
" an intelligent crime mystery story from up

and
- coming director bryan singer
.
" or maybe i shouldn
' t hve bought a foreign

. at the movei
' s opening
, a group of known criminals are brought in for a police lineup
, including mcmanus
( stephen baldwin
)
, keaton
( gabriel byrne
)
, fenster
( benicio del toro
)
, buckney
( kevin pollack
)
and verbal
( kevin spacey
, winner of the best supporting actor academy award
{ symbol 153
\ f
" times new roman
"
\ s 10
\ h
} for his performance in the movie
)
. verbal is so
- named because he frequently rambles on about anything or nothing
. he also earns his name as the movie
' s narrator
, spouting memorable lines like
" the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn
' t exist
"
(
al
though
, obviously
, he does exist
-
- what else could explain kris kross having a comeback in 1996
?
) while being interrogated by police detective chazz palminteri
( any actor with mutiple z
' s in their name is okay in my book
)
. we see the story unfold as spacey retells it
. the five felons
, upon being released from the lineup
, get thier revenge on the police by exposing a corrupt taxi service
-
- whereby elite criminals pay to be smuggled thru town in cop cars
-
-
and stealing all the money
and drugs in tjhe car
. it
' s a definite case of male bonding for the five criminals
, who later find out they were brought together by the unseen keyser soze
, who sends a minion tothe them with an offer they can
' t refuse
. namely
, they have to destory soze
' s main competitors in organized crime by infiltrating a ship
, shooting a bunch of people
, burning all the drugs
and stealing
$ 91 million cash
. spacey does a terrific job of bringing his seemingly unintelligent
" cripple
" character to life
and baldwin
, byrne
, palminteri
and the rest amke for a good supporting cast
. thte usual suspects is one of those movies that deftly mixes scenes of violence
and explosions with an underlying sense of mistery annd suspense
, keeping the viewer guessing until the very end
-
-
and
then still leaving a few details open for scrutiny
and discussion
. i suppose all that would be cleared up if i really hadnt rewound the movie
and watched it again instead of changing the channel annd wondering in disbelief whta thte hell kris kross was doing on mtv
. a different mystery
, i guess
, which may turn into a
_ murder
_ mystery if that video ever comes on again
