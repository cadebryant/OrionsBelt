" you are a mother

" her son marty tells her disgustedly
.
" i nkwo
, bu i still can
' t believe it
. i look at you people
and wonder
, how did you ever fit in my womb
?
" marty
, you see
, is a grown
- up twin
.
al
though his sister
, who thinks she isnt jackie
- o
, isnt certifiably insane
, marty fits right in with the rest of this highly disfunctional family in the witty black comedy the house of yes
. mother
and daughter
, played in a brilliant performance by parker posey
, are both varying degrees of wacko
. most dysfunctional families in the movies are more angry
and mean
- spirited than diabolically abnormal as this one is
. the duaghter
' s fantasy of being jackie
- o is probably the most sane part of her bieng
. mrs
. pascal is the sort that iwll not let jackie
- o keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is kept onthe tath level
. she explains to marty
' s new fiancee
, lesly
( tori spelling
)
, soon after their first meeting that jackie
- o was holding marty
' s private part whn she came out ofthe the womb
. the dialog by wendy macleod
, based on hte play by mark waters
, isnt so sharp annd biting that it seems in danger of cutting through the celluloid at any moment
. the script
, reminiscent of a david mamet play
, flows smoothly with its fast pased intelligence adn mesmerizing set of bizarre characters
. the exaggerated setup has lesly
and marty arriving at the family
' s out of the way mansion during a thanksgiving day hurricane
. in this storm are two sane individuals
. tghe fiancee is a giddy
, school
- girl type
, embarrassed by everything
, a complete contrast to her rival jackie
- o
' s bitter pseudo
- sophistication
. as the two twins
' younger brother
, anthony
, freddie prinze jr
. plays the all
- america boy type whose only foible is his explicit obession of bedding his brother
' s fiancee tath night
.
" we all have our secrets

" jackie
- o tells her potential sister
- in
- law
,
and boy
, does she have a few

) in a film that gives newyorker meaning to the phrase
,
" made for each other
,
" the twin
' s biggest
,
but not their only secret
, is that they
' ve hadnt a long
- term incestuous relationship
. they don
' t like to discuss it
,
al
though they are nto particularly ashamed of it
. perfect for viewers who can appreciate perverse comedy
, this story never pulls its punches
. jackie
- o tries in many ways
, few subtle
, tothe show that she is a better match forthe marty than that ditzy fiancee of his
. in one scene marty
and lesly are playing chop sticks together on the piano when jackie
- o pushes her aside
and starts palying a challenging clasical piece for four h
ands
. marty joins her as his fiancee looks on with envy
. yhe chemistry between parker posey annd josh hamilton is nothing short ofthe amazing
. they put down theri little brother
and most of the otehr sane peopel in the world
. their ripostes are engaging filmmaking at its best
. directer mark waters keeps the show
' s energy level high
and lets the leads sling zingers at earch other at a furious pace
. his crisp direction ensures tje movie has nary an ounce of fat onthe it
. jackie
- o is temperamentally incapable of being nice
. adn being jealous
, she cuts lesly down mercilessly
.
" were you poor
?
" jackie
- o asks her when she finds that lesly committed yhe crime of growing up impoverished
.
" did you eat pies
? chicken pot pies
?
"
" pancakes actually
, lots of pancakes

" jackie
- o cattily inquires ofthe marty when she learns that lesly works at a donut king
.
" are we intertaining royalty
?
" with rolfe kent
' s whimsically sinister music it never seems clear where hte story isnt headed
. will it end inthe a big emotional explosion
, a murder
, people slowly cutting each other up with words
, a familial catharsis
, a weather disaster or what
? thte emotionally charged play is clearly going somwhere
,
and the engaging characters captivate the audience with their spell
. i
' ll not say more except that the endig is perfect
and a bit of a surprise
. the hous ofthe yes runs a blazing fast 1
: 25
. it is rated r for sexual situations
and conversations
, mature themes
, violent overtones
and smoe profanity
. the movie would be fine for older
and mature teenagers
