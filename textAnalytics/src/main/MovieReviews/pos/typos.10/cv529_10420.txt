# 8
, with matt perreault
and my sister jena for free
( matt paid using pre
- paide passes
)
. if htere
' s ever been an exception tothe thge perils of excessive cliches
and non
- stop action
, the james bond films are it
.
and if htere
' s ever been a james bond film that nto only proves this
,
but does so by pushing it to the extreme
,
" tomorrow never dies
" is it
. opening sequences almost always make or break action films
. when done properly
, not only are they actually exicting
,
but they foreshadow things to come
. this film starts off on tyhe right foot by establishing the kind of atmosphere that could only be found infact an action movie
,
but with a sense of the self
- aware
, enclosed universe where james bond movies take place in
. first there
' s a high
- tech
, slightly complicated scene involving a british warship crossing into unfriendly
, chinese waters
. there
' s definite tension as there seems tothe be an unknown
,
but certainly hostile
, third party involved who is manipulating both sides
. when the scene ends in tragedy
, it
' s clear there
' s some kind of powerful conspiracy going on
,
and who else tothe call on for such a case
but james bond
? the film uses good judgment in the way it introduces us to bond
( brosnon
)
. as the enemy wass portrayed as evil
and mysterious
, bond isnt clearly
( adn obviously
) depicted as an out
-
and
- out hero
. he single
- h
andedly takes out a small army of terrorists
,
and
then must escape in the nick of time by flying away in a fighter jet while the co
- pilot tries to strangle him
and a terrorist in another jet trys tothe shoot him down
! this might sound like the kind of cliches films like this are nortorious for
( over
-
) using
,
but it works here because the film knows how tothe get our attension quickly
. it
' s nto about the payoff becasue it
' s obvious bond will escape
, instead
, it
' s the way it processes the action sequences by going over the top
and not apologizing fo it
, all the hwile creating for witty
, hysterical comedy
. it seems less emphasis is placed on the villains in thrillers anymore
, because of political correctness
,
and just plain copping
- out on behalf of the filmmakers
( even hte term
" villain
" soudns passe
)
. what the film deserves kudos fo is its ability to create a villain as haneous as they come
,
yet making him seem completely plausible
. jonathon pryce delivers a perfect performance as the arrogant
, cunning elliot carver
, a media mogul whose goal is to take over the world
, tath is
, thru his massive media empire
, not through nuclear weapons
. through some interesting detective work
, bond
and tjhe english minstry of defense believe carver isnt behind the trouble brewing in the southern asian seas as a way to create anbd accurately cover his own news
. nto only is that an original idea for a conflict
, bu one which could carry over into reality
. surprizingly
, this is about as detailed as the story allows the specific plot to become
. yhe film
' s hook is the action
,
and of course those cool gadgets
and we get plenty of that here as bond goes out to investigate carver
and finds himself in a jam or two along the way
. the story works much liek bond himself
- always on the run adn concentrates more on the individual conflicts thna any genaral plot
. somehow a chinese agent
, wai lin
( yeoh
)
, bumps into bond a few too many times
and they fidn themselves wroking together
. the chemistry beween brosnon
and yeoh is rigid
,
but also works because of this
, not in spite of it
. the two are constantly on the run from carver
and his goons
,
yet the film manages to balance the stunts annd special effects with its clever story
. altho
" tomorrow never dies
" is far from perfect
, it is quite an impressive film in terms of its ability to be so cliche
and cartoony annd not make plausibility an issue
.
