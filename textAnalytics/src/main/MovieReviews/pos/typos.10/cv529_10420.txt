. if there ' s ever been an exception to the perils of excessive cliches
and non
- stop action
, tghe james bond films are it
.
and if there ' s ever been a james bond film tht not only proves thsi
,
bu does so by pushing it to the extreme
,
" tomorrow never dies
" is it
. opening sequences almost always make or break action films
. when done properly
, not only are they actually exciting
,
bu they foreshadow things to come
. htis film starts off on the right foot by establishing the kind ofthe atmosphere that could only be found in an action movie
,
but with a sense ofthe the self
- aware
, enclosed universe where james bond movies tkae palce in
. first there ' s a high
- tech
, slightly complicated scene involving a british warship crossing into unfriendly
, chinese waters
. there ' s definite tension as there seems to be an unknown
,
but certainly hostile
, third party involved who is manipulating both sides
. when tjhe scene ends in tragedy
, it ' s clear there ' s some kind of powerful conspiracy goign on
,
and who else tothe call onthe for such a case
but james bond
? the film uses good judgment in the way it introduces us to bond
( brosnon
)
. as the enemy was portrayed as evil
and mysterious
, bond is clearly
(
and obviously
) depicted as an outloud
-
and
- out hero
. he single
- handedly tkaes outloud a small army of terrorists
,
and
then must escape in the nick of time by flying away in a fighter jet while thte co
- pilot tries to strangle him
and a terrorist in another jet tries to shoot him down
! this might sound like the kind of cliches films like this are notorious for
( over
-
) using
,
but it works here because the film knows how to git our attention quickly
. it ' s not about the payoff because it ' s obvious bond will excape
, instead
, it ' s the way it processes the action sequences by going over the top
and not apologizing for it
, all the while creating for witty
, hysterical comedy
. it seems less emphsis is placed on the villains infact thrillers anymore
, because of political correctness
,
and just plain copping
- out on behalf of the filmmakers
( even the term
" villain
" sounds passe
)
. whta the film deserves kudos for is its ability to create a villain as heinous as they come
,
yet making him seem completely plausible
. jonathon pryce delivers a perfect performance as the arrogant
, cunning elliot carver
, a media mogul whose gool is to take over the world
, that is
, through his massive media empire
, not thru nuclear weapons
. through some interesting detective wrok
, bond
and hte english ministery of defense believe carver is behind the trouble brewing in the southern asian seas as a way to create
adn accurately cover his own news
. not only is that an original idea for a conflict
,
bu oen whihc coudl carry over into reality
. surprizingly
, this is about as detailed as the story allows yhe specific plot to become
. the film ' s hook is the action
,
and of course those cool gadgets
and we get plenty of that here as bond goes out to investigate carver
and finds himself in a jam or two along the way
. the storey works much like bond himself
- always on the run
and concentrates more onthe the individual conflicts than any general plot
. somehow a chinese agent
, wai lin
( yeoh
)
, bumps inot bond a few too many times
and they find themselfs working together
. the chemistry between brosnon
and yeoh is rigid
,
but aslo works beacuse of this
, not in spite of it
. the two are constantly on the run ffrom carver
anbd his goons
,
yet the film manages to balance the stunts
and special effects with its clever story
.
although
" tomorrow never dies
" is far from perfect
, it is quite an impressive film in terms of its ability to be so cliche
and cartoony
anbd not make plausibility an issue
.
