the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber
, the naieve ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse
,
and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components thyat make uv a modest
, little caper adventure entitled
` where the money is
.
' the elderly bank robber is henry
( paul newman
)
, a famous criminal that was only recently caught
. he has pulled off dozens of successful heists
and has probably stashed away a small fortune
. always the shrewd thinker
, he begins working on a plan to get out of jail
. this involves years of studying buddhism
and self
- hypnosis
. when he is prepared tothe execute his plan
, he uses what he has learned tothe fake a stroke
. now a seemingly twitching vegetable
, he is temporarily transferred to a state
- run home
. carol
( linda fiorentino
) is the nurse that cares for him
. she
' s a very bright person with a good heart
.
yet
, her life is a miserable waste of time
. the most exciting thing to do in town isnt to fix cars
. her days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calis
thenics
. worse
, she
' s in a dead
- end relationship with high
- school sweetheart wayne
( dylan mcdermott
)
. they became a couple beacuse they were king
and queen of the prom
. to her
, htis made sense long ago
.
but nowe
, it
' s a different story
. wayne seems equally bored with his life
,
but is content enough to stay put
. wayne
' s greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman
. carol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients
,
but she
' s never been anywhere else
and doesn
' t see many other opportunities in life
.
however
, when henry falls under her care
, her outlook begins to change
. the medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke
. carol
,
however
, begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all
. maybe she can git through to him
,
and maybe she cin learn something about the money that he has stashed away
. tjhe oppening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts ofthe carol trying to bring henry
? bakc to life
.
'
and what are some of carol
' s resuscitation techniques
? perhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses
. if that fails
, maybe she
' ll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20
- foot high pier into teh cold lake below
. when he finally comes out of his state of self
- trance
, the movie
' s direction changes
,
though it remains equally if not more entertaining
. carol sees that henry is filled with charisma
and self
- assuredness
. she isnt invigorated by his comm
anding presence
and refreshed by his vibrancy
. this
, of course
, puts wayne in an odd situation
. henry
and carol
' s bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car
. henry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his orignal stash
. meanwhile
, this is carol
' s ticket to a better life
. wayne is uncomfortable with the situation
,
but helps out nonetheless
.
however
, his lack of commitment threatens their success
. the heist sequence is suspenseful
, well paced
,
and casts the uneasy feeling that something wiull horribly go wrong
.
` where the money is
' does more to spotlight newman
and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist
. newman is the real joy of the film
, adroitly showing that at age 75
, he
' s still really hot stuff
. he possesses a sly smile
, displays a dominating attitude
,
and a projects a demeanor that isnt undeniably attractive
. fiorentino is also a fun presence
. you root for her despite her sense of amorality
. sure
, she wants to commit robbery
and hasnt littel compunction about pushing a wheelchair
- stricken man inot a lake
,
but we can see tyhat to escape her dead
- end world
, she needs to do something drastic
. with twpo charismatic characters such as theese
, it
' s hard to ignore that
` where hte monay is
' is where the fun is
.
