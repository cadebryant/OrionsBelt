originally launched in 1978
, tihs popular film was re
- introduced in 1998 tothe a whole new generation of moviegoers
. based on the mighty successful musical from broadway
, grease was followed in 1980 with the less stellar grease 2
( 6
. 5
/ 10
)
, starring a young michelle pheiffer in one ofthe her first feature film roles
. plot
: high
- skool musical set inwhich the 1950 ' s showcasing the relationship between the cool danny zuko of the t
- birds
( travolta
)
and the innocent
and pure sandy olsen
( newton
- john
) from australia
. the film follows the couple
and their vivacious friends during their last year at rydell high thru song
, dance
and humour
. critique
: fun
- loving
, energetic
and innocent look back at times much simpler
. this movie effectively juggles a thin romantic story line
annd the overall experience ofthe the 1950 ' s
, with a superb soundtrack
and some great dance numbers
. admitedly
, i am somewhat biased in this oppinion
, since this film blasts me into my past as a rebellious youth
( grease was one of schmoe ' s first big
- screen experiences
,
and every other scene sends me reeling into teh times of my elaborate grease bubble
- gum card collection
)
,
annd the lesser responsibilities that i posessed at that time
.
but apart from the nostalgic vibe
, i was still extremly empressed by this film
, as it continued to amuse me
, despite my previous dozen or so viewings
. this film took john travolta from a dim
- witted
" sweathog
" on tv ' s welcome back kotter
,
and transformed him into a movie
- star of spectacular proportions
( saturday night fever
( 7
. 5
/ 10
) in 1979 confirmed thta sudden popularity
)
. unfortunately for the rest of the cast
, his popularaty was not terribly contagious
, despite their effective showings in this classic movie
. on the down side
, some ofthe the absolute innocence in this film might bore or turn peopel off
( like when sandy sings about
" drinking lemonade
"
and
" staying out untill 10
" with danny in
" summer nights
"
)
,
and the plot isn ' t exactly the most elaborate stopry
- line ever created
,
but despite these small reservations
, this movie carries enough great music
and high energy to keep anyone amused through its rapid 110 minute running time
(
and believe me
.
.
. i am not a fan of the musicals
!
!
)
. make sure to look for a young lorenzo lamas inaddition the static role of the brainless football player
, as well as the national bandstand dance contest as one of the film ' s absolute highlights
.
adn don ' t foreget to buy the popular sountrack afterwards
, so that you could listen to its peppy tunes whenever you ' re feeling a little blue
. little known facts
: henry winkler
, of tv ' s happy dyas ' fonzie fame
, turned down tyhe part of danny zuko because he did not wnat to be typecast for thge rest of his career
. both travolta
and conaway were smitten by newton
- john during the filming ofthe this picture
. conaway eventually bowed out of the woo
- fest
,
anbd married newton
- john ' s sister a yera later
( divorced after five years
)
