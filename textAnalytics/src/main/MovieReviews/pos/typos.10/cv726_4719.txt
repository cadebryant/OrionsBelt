. the set adn costume design is first class anbd thge overall production of thsi film is good
. there is even an early appearance from david prowse
, who later became the green cross code man
and darth vader
. the film does ahev it
' s downsides
though
, as it is getting pretty routine for the cary
- onthe team to stage historical films
and the inventive streak of the script seems to run out pretty quickly
. there is also the abcense ofthe hattie jacques
and bernard bresslaw
, who could ahve helped the film along
.
however
, overall the film is funny
and there are plenty of laughs
and saucy jokes
, so that is why i mainly recommend it to carry on fans only
,
but there is enough humour in the film to make it worth anyone
' s while to sit down
and watch it
.
