. the set
and costume design is first class
and the overall production of this film is good
. there is even an early appearance ffrom david prowse
, who later became the green cross code man
annd darth vader
. the film does have it ' s downsides
though
, as it is getting pretty routine for the carry
- on team to stage historical films
and the inventive streak ofthe the script seems to run out preety quicklyu
. there isnt also the absense of hattie jacques
and bernard bresslaw
, who could haev helped the film allong
.
however
, overall the film is funny
and ther are plenty of laughs
annd saucy jokes
, so thyat is why i mainly recommend it to carry on fans only
,
but there is enough humour in tyhe film to mkea it worth anyone ' s while to sit down
and watch it
.
