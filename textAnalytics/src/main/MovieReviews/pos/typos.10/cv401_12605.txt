_ in brief
:
_ this film needs noone introduction
. if you haven
' t heard of it
,
then you must ahve been up in space on a sabbatical
,
and if you haven
' t seen it
-
- well
, i suspect yuo
' re in a small minority
! firt thing
' s first
? is it all it
' s hyped up tothe be
? well
, yes
?
and no
. it
' s a good film
,
and there
' s a lot to like about it
,
but it
' s nto without its problems
. when i saw the first trailer for
" titanic
"
, it was when i went tothe see
" bean
" lsat summer
, i think
, my intial reaction was
-
- ain
' t that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful
, real
- life tragedy
?
! i mean
, what
' s happened to hollywood
' s script
- writers
, have they run entirely out of new ideas
? gads
, whatever next
, i asked myself
, how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme
? i was not entirely filled with anticipation
,
but
then i wasn
' t alone in that respect
. it
' s when it came out in the cinema
, to rave reviews
( well
, mostly
) annd anyone who
' d been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice
! i didn
' t see the film until several months aftter its release
( by which time my sister had seen it about four times
!
)
, so i went with a slightly more open mind
,
but i still didn
' t think i
' d enjoy it much
. did i
? yes
and no
. mainly yes
, i
' m happy tothe say
. the first hour or so was beautifully done
, not so much because of the scripting
( i
' ll talk about that later
?
)
but because the re
- created ship
and sets were stunning to look at
, as was cameron
' s directing
,
and tjhe performances of the principal cast were so strong tath the
" human
" aspect of the story
, the romance between rose
( kate winslet
)
and jack
( leonardo dicaprio
)
, was enchanting
. the film is told via flashback
, with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day
( you knew that
, a
' course
!
:
-
)
)
. well
, it
' s an often effective device to use in storytelling
-
-
though sometimes it can fall flat
. does it work here
? in script form it doesn
' t add all that much tothe the story
. what does add a lot tothe the story is gloria stuart
, whose stunning performence is the strongest
, most moving of the film
. her presence brings a much deeper level of passion
,
and depth to the story
,
and
though her appearances are relatively brief
, hte film would have suffered without her
. also impressive are dicaprio
and winslet
, who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue
,
and the bond they form is both heartfelt
and moving
. it
' s an old story
, you nkow
-
- forbidden love ala romeo annd juliet
-
-
but it works
,
and jack
' s
" rescuing
" rose
( in both literal
and figurative senses
)
and teaching her to live life for wqat counts was pointed
and touching
. iin fact
, i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot
, largly because winslet
and dicaprio bring such annd charm
, energy to the romance
. it
' s engaging
, touching
and very enjoyable
. there
' s more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well
, simply because you know it
' s not going to be a happy ending
. which leads us to the second half of thte film
. we all knew it was comming
. i
' m sure director cameron wass looking foward with eager anticipation to it
, because as he
' s stated in interviews
, the real thrust of the story
( for him
) wass the sinking
,
and the jack
/ rose romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get yuo emotionally into the film
. i think that understates the importance of the romance
, as i foudn it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die
. the iceberg arrives
,
and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour
. adn it is an hour
. my goodness
, we don
' t miss a second of that hour
? gratuitous
? well
, perhaps not by today
' s st
andards
, i
' m sure there
' s been far worse produced under the banner of
" entertainment
" in other films
.
but i certainly wasn
' t prepared for how shocking
and graphic thge last hour or so would be
. not thta i
' d expect the owrd
" understatement
" to be part of cameron
' s vocabulary
( he who brought us such
, umm
, vivid films as
" terminator 2
"
and
" aliens
"
)
. is it overdone
? i
thought so
. understatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy
. no
, no one expeced a hapyp ending
,
but i didn
' t quite expect the horrendously shocking
and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the film
' s second half
. still
, whether it was overdone
and heavy
- h
anded or not
, if it was the shock
- factor cameron was after it worked
, because i was shocked
and moved
, inthe fact i spended most of the last hour in tears
! you realy couldn
' t help
but get emotionally involved
, whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of rose
' s overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack
, or that jack would rescue rose
, or that they would both survive
. perheaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk
,
and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface
. the bit where rose lets go of jack
' s h
and
, while promising she
' ll never let go in her heart was particularly heart
- wrenching
,
and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image
, to put no fine a point on it
. i loved the endig
,
however
, which was both moving
and slightly uplifting follwoing thge horror of the past hour
and a half
. so
, we
' ve established that the film is powerfull
and moving
, if tghe last hour ws rather excessive
. haven
' t mentioned the script
. plot
- wise it
' s ok
,
though the jack
/ rose relationship was beautifully developed
,
but i
' ve a feeling that
' s to the actors credit if anything
. as for the dialogue
? well
, titanic is set in 1912
. it
' s a period drama
. bu i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned
. did they really use phrases like
" goddamn it
!
" back in the turn of the century
? i doubt it
. would somene talk like this
:
" do ya love the guy or what
?
"
. i doubt it
. is such dialogue as
" i saw the iceberg
,
and i see it in your eyes now
" not just a bit
? clumsy
? yes it is
. a littel mroe attention tothe dialogue would not have gone astray
,
and cameron himself is to blame
( he wrote the scirpt
)
. stick witht directing
, dude
.
but its more than redeemed by the acting
, witht dicaprio
and winslet on fine form
, ably supported by a strong casted
. star of the show was gloria stuart
,
though
-
- why didn
' t she win that oscar
?
! aftter all
, they were throwing oscars at
" titanic
" left
, right
and centre
,
but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee
. directing
- wise cameron does a spectacular job
. like i said
, his vision was a bit excessive
,
but at least he directed it well
. i haven
' t even mentioned james horner
' s beautiful score
. utterly heavenly
,
though when your dad
and sister play the soundtrack a lot you do start to get a bit bored with it
!
;
-
) i
' ve finished my rant
, whihc lasted a lot longer than i
thought it would
! just leaves a couple ofthe questions
; was it worth all those oscars
? hell
, don
' t talk to me about oscars
. bloomin
' farce
. it was deserving in a number of departments
,
though
. last question
; is it
, as soem suggest
, one of the best films of all
- time
? nope
, i don
' t think so
. it
' s certainly one of the most powerful
and memorable films i
' ve ever seen
, bu i don
' t tihkn it quite ranks as one of my all
- time favourites
.
and as for the fact they
' re reportedly making a
" titanic 2
"
? well i guess that
' s typical hollywood for you
!
