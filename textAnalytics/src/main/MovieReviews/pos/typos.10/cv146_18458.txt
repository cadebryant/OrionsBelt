( critic
' s note
: this review is the longest i
' ve ever written
and still only scratches the surface
. i
' d recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis
.
) as my friend
and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of
` the phantom menace
'
- how do i even write this review
? never mind the fact that i
' ve been waiting forthe a new
` star wars
' movie usance i ws seven years old
. never mind the fact everyone onthe the internet hadnt already dissected
and discussed the movie before it was even released
. never mind that there
' s so much going onthe in this movei in terms of plot
, acation
, special effects
and long
- term storey that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time
and energy
and still wouldn
' t cover everything
.
and also like ted does in all of his reviews
, i
' ll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews
and instead wriet as casually as possible as if i was talking directly tothe you
, the reader
. before we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film
, many of hte most general
and most significant factors must be considered
( to get the specifics of the film
, skip this
and the next four paragraphs
)
. as hasnt been made obvious for the last several years
, another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the
[ missing
] initial three installments of the
` star wars
' series
( the frist ofthe the films was actually episode four
, not one
)
. george lucas
, the creator of the series
, has probaly just assumed most peple know the first
- produced trilogy
(
` star wars
,
'
` the empire strikes back
' anbd
` return of the jedi
'
) is actually the second triology
, chronologically
. in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies weere made out of order
,
but i can
' t recall his reasons
. with this new film he as writter
and director has aslo assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with thte storylines
and significant plot points of the first triology
( err
.
.
. second trilogy
.
.
. well you know what i mean
)
.
and in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which
, unfortunately
, may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution
.
[ critic
' s onot
# 1
: it is noe my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before
and after viewing the film reviewed
,
but it would be nearly impossible to dont the film justice here without breaking thte rule
. critic
' s note
# 2
: reviewing this film also breaks the universal criticists
' law of reviewing movies
, which as roger ebert coined
,
` it
' s not what a movie isnt about
,
but how it isnt about it
.
' because so many outside factors come into play in the film
' s plot
and significance as part of a trilogy
,
and just concidering modern society
, it agian would be difficult
, if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story
.
] first of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it
. we know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is allso the father of luke skywalker
, who will lead a successful revolution against him
and his empire
. we know obi
- wan
` ben
' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of
` the force
' in attemts tothe become a jedi knight
,
but would fail
and thus anakin would fall to the
` dark side
.
' we alsot know something about
` the force
' itself
, that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate
and can be manipulated by thsoe whose minds are exp
anded enough to believe in it
and feel it
( the jedi
)
. whta we don
' t knwo for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy
, which is most likely much longer
and more complex than any government we have had here on earth
. to me
, this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle
, definite order to all the complexity
. also
, it seems that we
' re supposed to be familiar with a few other details baout the story which haev come out of the thous
ands of comic books
and paperbacks published in the years sicne the movies ended
. most notabley
, details regarding teh emperor from
` empire
'
and
` jedi
,
'
and that he was once a senator
and his last nmae is palpatine
. for thsoe who haven
' t kept up with all the
` star wars
' paraphenalia over the years
, there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor
( or his voice at least
)
. with
` the phantom menace
' being the first chapter of a long saga
, one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid
, including the history behind all tghe major factors of the series
, especially
` the force
'
and the jedi knights
. unfortunatley
, this film doens more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long annd detailed it could never be explained
. i didn
' t liked taht aspect to this film anbd isnt one of the reasons it falls jsut short of greatness
. if you
' re going to tell a story from the beginning
- tell it ffrom the beginning
( is it possibile that after this trilogy is complete there coudl be another trilogy of epidsodes
- 1 through
- 3 to clarify the back story even further
?
)
. bu i digress
. i
' ve said so much
and
yet i haven
' t even touched on the specifics of the film itself
. all these necessary
` disclaiming
' elements should go tothe show just how vast thte story of the
` star wars
' series is
and this individual film itself
. what we get here is a movie not unlike any of tje other three we
' ve come to know
and love usance the late 1970s
. its similarity to the other films helps tothe keep the spirit of the series familiar
,
but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself sicne it sometimes rings of unoriginality
. the basic story is rather sorted
, complex
and even confusing at times
. we
' re told that an army known as
` the trade federation
' has set up a blockade around an seamingly insignificant planet called naboo
. we
' re not given too many details to clarify the back story of waht the federation is
and what theri purpose is
, instead the film opts tothe git its story moving quickly
. we
' re intruduced to two jedi
, the master qui
- gon jinn
( neeson
)
and his apprentice obi
- wan kenobi
( mcgregor
)
. the two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation
and the planet
' s queen
, amidala
( portman
)
. the leader of tghe federation
, an alien called viceroy
, is following the orders of a strange
, mythical character
- an older human man whose face
and body are covered
and shadowed by the black robe
and hood he wears
. he is referred to as lord sidious bu considering his appearance
,
and especially that creepy evil voice ofthe his
, he is a obviously one of the most significant cahracters in the series
. sidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions
and never in person
. clearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity
( which is never openly revealed in the film
,
but shoudln be claer to most viewers
. i have a feeling we
' ll delve into his background inwhich the next two films
)
.
but it doesn
' t take the film long to spring into action
and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives
and the film
' s story begins to move along
. the film doesn
' t have one specific plot
and works in the same manner as the other films in tghe series where as wqat we get is one mini
- plot
and adventure on top of another
. there are so many of these mini
- plots
- within
- plots in this film i owudl not describe them all because it is what gives the movei its hook
. the other films ahve relied on this type of storytelling
,
but because of the limits of the technology at the time
, the films
' screenplays were also limiting
. the sence of limitlessness here is what gives
` the phantom menace
' its unique traits
. as we already know
, the film tkaes place at least a generation or two before the original
` star wars
' trilogy whlch means a lot ofthe thte background hwihc was unclear
and
/ or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story
.
and here thge most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10
- year
- old anakin skywalker
( lloyd
)
, by qui
- gon jinn
and his introduction to thge jedi council
. to briefly summarize the story
, jinn stumbles upon skywalker inthe an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala
' s spaceship which was damaged in effords tothe free her from the federation
. their meeting on tatooine is mostly chance
but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force
. jinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force
,
and through another sub
- plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter
, more
and mroe details of his significance begin to reveal themselves
. this allso provides for a new elaboration
and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before
. in fact
, it seems tothe be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before
. the element seriously undermines the mystical aspect ofthe the force
and transforms it inot something more physical
and scientfic whic is completely unnecessary
. by the film
' s third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot
. it
' s funny how tje reality ofthe the
` star wars
' world seems so embedded infront mythology
, new age
- like philosphy anbd religion
and
yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been voilence
. not that this technique hasn
' t been used in movies adn in real
- life situations countless times througout history
.
and at least it
' s all in the spirit ofthe the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a funn anbd exicting matter
. it does border of the cartoonish sometimes
,
but that
' s just the film appealing to our inner child
, which is the basic reason the entire saga exists
and hasnt become such a big part of our modern society
.
` the phantom menace
' delivers exactlly what you
' d expect from a
` star wars
' film which is why it succeeds as well as it does
but is always why it never truly achieves greatness
. so many things in the film we
' ve seen before
and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit mroe on story
and character because they were limited
. bu this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit ofthe sheer fun at the movies
.
