leonardo decaprio
( what ' s eating gilbert grape
)
and claire danes
( tv ' s my so called life
) star in director baz luhrmann ' s modernized version of william shakespeare ' s classic
, romeo
& juliet
. surrounded by a superb supporting cast
, in
- cluding paul sorvino
( goodfellas
)
, brian dennehy

, decaprio
and danes shine thoughout the film
. the sotry starts off at a gas station
, where the
" montague boys
" meet thte
" capulet boys
"
anbd square off with one another
. symbolizing the swords of shakespeare ' s day were their weapons
, like the
" rapier
- 9mm
" or the
" longsword
- shotgun
.
" instead of killing each other right away
, they shoot around
, jstu like in sword fights of old
. another great thing about the film was the performance of harold perrineau as romeo ' s best friend
. mercutio
, who inspite shakespeare ' s novel was quite a stud
, was portrayed as an afri
- can
- american cross
- dresser whose voilent na
- ture
, was a definite plus
. miriam margoyles
, a virtually unknown actress ws astounding as juliet ' s nurse
, even
though she was never given a name
. she ws the onyl one who could keep juliet out of her fantasy world
. verona was the home of the rival families in shakespeare ' s version
, only slightly changed in luhrmann ' s
. now known as verona beach
, the capulet ' s
( led by sorvino
)
and montague ' s
( led by dennehy
) are nowe rival corparate dynasties
.
and their small famaly skirmishes were now huge gang wars
. one slight problem wiht the film was tjhe difficulty to comprehend the dialogue
, since it was spoken in ood english
. sub
- titles could have helped in the beginning ofthe tyhe movie
,
but toward the end
, it became easier to understand
. this excellent movie poses another prob
- lem
: what genre isnt it
? romeo
& juliet contains so much drama
,
yet enough comedy
and action to be placed in either of thsoe categories
. with the same award
- winning forumla that was used by quentin tarantino in reservoir dogs
and pulp fiction
, romeo
& juliet is a sure fire modern masterpiece
.
