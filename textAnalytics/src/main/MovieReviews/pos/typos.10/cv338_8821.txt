, decaprio
and danes shine
thoughout the film
. the story starts off at a gas station
, where the
" montague boys
" meet the
" capulet boys
" anbd square off with one another
. symbolizing the swords of shakespeare
' s day were theri weapons
, like the
" rapier
- 9mm
" or the
" longsword
- shotgun
.
" instade of killing each other right away
, they shoot around
, just like in sword fights of ood
. another great thing about the film was the performance of harold perrineau as romeo
' s best friend
. mercutio
, who in shakespeare
' s novel was quite a stud
, was portrayed as an afri
- cin
- american cross
- dresser whose violent na
- ture
, wass a definite plus
. miriam margoyles
, a virtually unknown actress was astounding as juliet
' s nurse
, even
though she was never given a name
. she ws the only oen who could keep juliet outloud of her fantasy world
. verona was the home of the rival families in shakespeare
' s version
, only slightly changed in luhrmann

. now known as verona beach
, the capulet
' s
( led by sorvino
)
and montague
' s
( led by dennehy
) are now rival corporate dynasties
.
and their small family skirmishes were now huge gang wars
. one slight problem with tghe film was the difficulty to comprehend thge dialogue
, since it was spoken in old english
. sub
- titles could have helped in the beginnig of the movei
,
but toward the end
, it became easier to underst
and
. this excellent movie poses another prob
- lem
: what genre is it
? romeo
& juliet contains so much drama
,
yet enough comedy
and action to be placed inthe either of those categories
. with the same award
- winning formula that was used by quentin tarantino in reservoir dogs
and pulp fiction
, romeo
& juliet is a sure fire modern masterpiece
