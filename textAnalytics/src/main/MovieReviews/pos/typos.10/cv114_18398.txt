it is easy tothe label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing a child
? whether that may be in life or in death
. after having said that
, i wiull also say that this movie does all of the above very well
. one gets that choking sensation in the throat
( because of grief
) wehn one brother forgives another fo a costly mistake
, or when a husban hugs his wief after a long estrangement
. htere is no ocean
, no drownings
and it does not conjure up memories of yot another
? ordinary people
'
. in fact the only thing remotely connected to the ocean is probably tap water
and the toilet flushing
( not tht this literally happened in the movie
)
. so what are hte lessons learnt
: 1
. don
' t tkae your childrens to class reunions
. 2
. don
' t leave them alone in the lobby
, not even for a second
. michelle pfeiffer once again plays the role of a highly
- strung wife
and mother
, a trend thgat started with
? a thous
and acres
'
and
? one fine day
'
. my comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung iin this movie
, so much so that when she has a nervous break down
, the veins onthe her temples bulge impressively
. whoopi golberg also puts in an understated performance
, playing a lesbian cop
, whith a name that makes oen want to reach for a lollipop
. lastly
, who are the ideal companions for this sort of movie
? my gr
andmother comes to mind
.
