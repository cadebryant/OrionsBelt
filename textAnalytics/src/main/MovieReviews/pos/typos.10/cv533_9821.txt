capsule
: trippy
, hyperspeed action machine from hong kong
' s accomplished tsui hark
. van damme
and rodman have nice chemistry
, the stunts are eyepopping
,
and stuff gets blowed up real good
; whta more do you want
? i admit i wass all set to loathe double team
; it reeked of cheapjack timing
- oriented marketing
( stick dennis rodman in a movie
, quick
, while he
' s hot
, anbd do something about jean
- claude van damme
' s flagging career hwile we
' re at it
!
)
. surprise
-
- double team transcends its dumb roots
and turns out tothe be a mess of fun
. bring some friends
, get some pretzels
,
and have a blast
. van damme isnt jack quinn
, an ex
- agent who is brought back in for
" one last mission
"
-
- you
' d think any spy worth his shoe phone would run like hell when he hears those words
.
but van damme
' s character has a pregnant wief who
' s allso a sculptor
,
and some unpleasant pressure gets used to get him tothe come through on this mission
. he
' s been assigned to take down an old enemy
, a terrorist named stavros
( mickey rourke
, looking oddly subdued
)
, who may be back up to his old tricks
. in the first showdown between quinn
and stavros
, the movie wears its ambitions proudly on its sleeve
: nonstop action
. an amusement park
, a hospital
, a private
" retired spy
"
' s retreat
, most ofthe rome
, various houses
, planes
, cars
and other modes of transport
,
and the coliseum
(
!
) all become arenas for some of the most bone
- rattling shoot
- outs
and punch
- outs filmed
. they are better seen than decribed
and are reason enough to see the film
: one jaw
- droping scene has van damme taking on a man who uses a switchblade with his
* fezent
*
.
( van damme is a good
, dextrous athlete
and fighter
,
but he is often upstaged
.
) there are other nice touches
. stavros
and quinn both want the same thing
: to retire in peace wtih their families
. that ambition ties them toghether in various ways
,
and also humanizes them a bit
. one of the things about hk action movies is that there
' s always some form of human element
,
and that
' s carried over into this movie as well
. it gives weight to scenes that would otherwise be forgettable
. also good is dennis rodman
, playing a weapons dealer named yaz
-
- a character who sticks outloud liuke a fistful ofthe broken fingers
and who is funny just st
anding there
. rodman is natural on screen
; he
' s fun to watch
, especially when slinging bad guys like basketballs
,
and deserves to get a movie of his own
, based on what
' s seen here
: a lightweight
, fast
- moving entertainment that showcases all ofthe its pieces excellently
.
