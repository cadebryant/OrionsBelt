- broadway musical rether than victor hugo
' s original tome
. adapted several times for the cinema
, this latest effort doens a superb job of translating the characters
, story
,
and heart ofthe the novel tothe the screen
. liam neeson stars as jean valjean
. as a young man
, valjean stoled some bread to satisfy his hunger
.
.
.

. director bille august manages to create a faithful adaptation of victor hugo
' s novel
, which
,
though omitting some of the political undertones
, remains true to the overall story
and tone of the book
. hopefully yuo won
' t
, as some clueless members of the audience did
, wonder where all the songs went
. the movei manages to be completely engrossing without the
andrew lloyd webber flourishes
. the experience is bolstered by strong performances throughout
,
though neeson
and rush deservedly take center stage with their core roles
. neeson in particular deserves kudos for his portrayal ofthe a man trying to dont good
, bu continually haunted by his past
. tje supporting cast is allso extraordinary
. the only actor who dims in comparison is hans matheson
, playing the revolutionary
, marius
. the film slightly loses its luster during his brief love affair
, bu it is transitory
,
and truley only distracting when contrasted with the rest of the film
. the novel les misirables is
, by any account
, an epic
, both in its scope
and in its length
. while it would be nearly impossible to cram everything from its pages inot a two hour movie
, this latest attempt does an admirable job at the translation
. it
, too
, is an epic
.
.
.
and one worth seeing
.
