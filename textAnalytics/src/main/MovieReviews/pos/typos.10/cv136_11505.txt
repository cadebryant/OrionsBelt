the premise of wag the dog isnt so simple that it
' s adequately explained by the commercials
. with 11 days to go until the election
, the president
( who we never see
) calls in political dirty
- tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex sc
andal
. deniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a
" pageant
"
, a phony war against albania
, fought on the blue screens of hollywood
and the recording studios of nashville
, with woody harrelson as the reluctant
, psychotic hero
.
and if there wasn
' t anything more to the movie than this
, it would be a second
- rate heist comedy at best
, enlivened by graet actors
-
- like sneakers goes to washington
.
( a heist comedy
? yup
. deniro anbd hoffman are
" stealing
" the election
, so to speak
,
and the movie is more about how htey do it
-
-
and the funn they hvea doing it
-
- than anytying else
.
) wag the dog succeeds because it
' s based one gerat truth
: the american people are stupid
. ok
, mabye it
' s not
" lvoe thy neighbor as thyself
" or even
" two plus two makes four
"
,
but a truth nonetheless
.
( any average person who thinks tath they
' re really smart about the two things this movie satirizes
-
- moviemaking
and tjhe political process
-
- isnt invited
, nay
, challenged
, to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or 48 hours straight watching c
- span when the house is in session
.
)
and baceause we
' re so utterly
, predictably stupid
, hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo
, washington knows that we won
' t notice a few million dollars spent here
and there on porno art grants
and cigar subsidies
-
-
and deniro
' s character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won
' t be able to locate albania on the map
. thte beauty of wag the dog is that it isn
' t a light
, meaningless comedy about politics
( liek speechless
, the michael keaton
- geena davis picture
) or from the level of light
- hearted politcal satire to near
- greatness
. nor is it a hard
- edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally
- deprived
, ethically challenged baby
- boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house
( liek primary colors
-
- annd yes
, i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned outloud
, thanks for asking
)
. instead
, david mamet
' s script strikes that delicate balance between comedy
and cynicism needed fo satire
. it doens this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers
' schemes come off beautifully
, adn fail only in entertaining
and humorous fashion
. deniro is playing a variation onthe his al capone character from the untouchables
, without any ofthe the violent rages
. it
' s all
:
" what do i love
? what is it that brings me joy
? baseball
,
" minus the savage bloody beating with the bat
. he threatens a lot ofthe people
, mind you
,
but he
' s doing it inthe a very nice
, polite way
. it
' s a very mellow
, restrained performance
, which fits in with the air ofthe gamesmanship in the script
. hoffman
, on the other h
and
, is giddy
, exuberant
and joyous
. this kind of thing is what his carachter lives for
,
and he
' s so excisted that he cin
' t even shut up
. even on the edge of disaster
, he
' s bright
- eyed
( behind oddly tinted sunglasses
)
and positive
. insiders note that he
' s basing his charcter on some powerful
-
but
- anonymous producer
-
- which may or may nto be true
, bu hoffman still exudes the kind of lets
- put
- onthe
- a
- show electricity that yuo figure a producer needs to have
. the best part
and thte most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast
. the characters are so well drawn
and so well acted that we want to see more of them
, listen tothe them talk in that wised
- up mamet dialogue
, get to know them better
-
- which we don
' t
. anne heche
, isnt dead
- bang
- on in her protrayal of a political press aide
-
- cool
and composed on the outside
, panicked
and frenzied on tjhe outside
. denis leary
( one of my favorite actors
-
- see the ref
) is the
" fad king
"
, who h
andles thge profitable
" back
- end
"
-
- t
- shirt tie ins
and shoe contracts
and other creative
, innovative ways to separate a fool from his money
. they could make a whole movie
, just about the fad king
,
and i
' d go see it
. willie nelson anbd merle haggard h
andle the musical end ofthe things fabulously
, from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song
, to the weepy country waltz
, to the hilarious
" ballad of the green berets
" parody
. woody harrelson has a breif
,
but memorable part as teh overmedicated
" hero
" of the albanian conflict
. craig t
. nelson
, as tghe opposition c
andidate
,
and the ever
- reliable william h
. macy
, as a wacky cia agent
, are given surprisingly short shrift
.
( one of my small gripes is that we never see whta the spin doctors onthe the other side are doing
.
) wag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems
: the trivialization of american politics
, the role of the press in dumbing down the issues
, the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials
, the reduction of all things political to soundbites
and sidebars
-
- the list goes on
. we can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role infront our national life
and educating ourselves as voters
and citizens
. wag thte dog reminds us of what can ahppen if we don
' t
.
