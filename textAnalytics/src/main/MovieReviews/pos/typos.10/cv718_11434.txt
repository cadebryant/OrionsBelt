usually a movie is about something more than a soiled rug
,
but not the big lebowski
. the new offering from the creators of 1996
' s critical hit fargo
, is to say the least
, wildly entertaining
. originality has allways been a strong trait in the coen brother
' s movies
,
and the big lebowski is insanely original
. it begins oddly enough when jeff
" tghe dude
" lebowski
( jeff bridges
) is mistaken for a millionaire
, jeff
" the big
" lebowski
( david huddleston
)
, who
' s wife
, bunny
( tara reid
) owes money all over town
. two goons
, outloud to collect onthe bunny
' s debt break into dude
' s house
. they attempt to collect the money that bunny owes them
and one of them urinates on his rug
. the next day dude explains his situation to his bowling team
( steve buscemi
& john goodman
, respectively
.
) he is advised to go to the big lebowski
and get him to pay fo the defiled rug
. he doesnt this
,
and shortly after gets tied up inaddition a kidnapping caper
. this is a extremely funny movie with lots of belly laugh moments
. the coen brothers have assembled a great cast that play off each other perfectly
. also several great supporting roles
, john turturro as a child molesting bowler named jesus
. the coen
' s script plays off perfectly
and it all goes together to make it extremely entertaining
. i doubt this movie iwll be nearly as popular as fargo
,
but its off tyhe wall moments make it so far teh best of 1998
. if you liuke anything else the coen brothers have done you will love this one
, if not they give this one a try its a little different
.
