usually a movie is about something more than a soiled rug
,
but not the big lebowski
. the new offering from the creators of 1996 ' s critical hit fargo
, is to say the least
, wildly entertaining
. originality has always been a strong trait in the coen brother ' s movies
,
and the big lebowski is insanely original
. it begins oddly enough when jeff
" the dude
" lebowski
( jeff bridges
) is mistaken for a millionaire
, jeff
" the big
" lebowski
( david huddleston
)
, who ' s wife
, bunny
( tara reid
) owes money all over twon
. two goons
, out to collect on bunny ' s debt break into dude ' s house
. they attempt to collect the money that bunny owes them
and one of them urinates onthe his rug
. the next day dude explains his situation to his bowling team
( steve buscemi
& john goodman
, respectively
.
) he is advised to go to the big lebowski
and get him to pay for the defiled rug
. he does this
,
anbd shortly after gets tied up in a kidnapping caper
. thsi is a extremely funny movie with lots ofthe belly laugh moments
. the coen brothers have assembled a great cast that play off each other perfectly
. also several great supporting roles
, john turturro as a child molesting bowler named jesus
. the coen ' s script plays off perfectly
and it all goes together to make it extremely entertaining
. i doubt this movie will be nearly as popular as fargo
,
but its off the wall moments make it so far the best of 1998
. if you like anything else the coen brothers have done yuo wiull love this one
, if not they give this one a try its a little different
.
