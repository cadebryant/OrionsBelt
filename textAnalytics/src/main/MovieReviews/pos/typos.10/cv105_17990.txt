- watching italian writer
/ director dario argento
' s much lauded murder mystery tenebrae
, i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller
and manages tothe get away witht
. in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notoreous in cult film circles
,
but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest ofthe his
" giallo
" murder mysteries
. while it
' s certainly not perfect
, repeated viewings reveal it tothe be nonetheless a densely plotted
and terrifically stylish thriller
. the story follows a promotional visit tothe rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal
( anthony franciosa
) where he discovers that a serial killer is on tyhe loose inspired by his latest book
" tenebrae
"
. with the police on his back for leads
, he decides tothe take a personal interest in the case
and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is nto as it seems
. the film benefits enormously ffrom a fine central performance by franciosa
. he brings grace
, charm
and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil tothe both the violence of the books he writes
and the unfolding real
- life horror around him
. the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension
. argento peels back the facade of showbiz
and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral
, ambivalent
, shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business
. tenebrae is perhaps the most multi
- layered of argento
' s scripts to date
and htere is much bubbling underneath the surface here
. it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play
. in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red
/ profondo rosso
( the full
- length itallian laguage version
) anbd fans will enjoy spotting the recuring themes
. needless to say for argento fans
, there is no denying the director
' s brilliance as a stylist
. many of the action
and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse
and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork
. htey are all the more impressive for the fatc that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes wtih light
, rather than the dark shadows
and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red
and suspiria
. instead
, tenebrae
' s set design
and lighting paints a sleek
, clinical
, chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world
.
and the sountrack
' s mix of eletronic atmospheres
and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment
. so tenebrae has much to recommend it
, no question
. still
, constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is severeal lumps iin the narrative
. some critics argue that logic doesn
' t matter in argento films
,
but damnit
, it matters in all films to the point where viewers don
' t deserve to feel cheated
. by the way
, if you don
' t wanna to know the solution to the mystery
then skip the next threee paragraphs
. about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which
, properly h
andled
, could have proved ingenious
. we witness the murder of tyhe serial killer hismelf by a man who
, we later discover
, is none other than the author peter neal
. he is insane
, apparently
. the murders
then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it
' s time to settle some peronal business involving his neurotic wife
. he is finally revealed tothe us as thsi
" second killer
" in the film
' s bloody climax
.
but argento muffs thte twist
, both technically
and narratively
. you see
, we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that durring this scene peter neal is actually an innocent wittness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the wohle time
and spying on the killer
' s hous
.
but thanks to poor editing
, its had to beleave neal could ahev murdered the killer anyway
. bad cutting puts the timing way out
. in other words
, he
' s almost in two places at once
. during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring
. by the film
' s end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must haev self
- inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant
. yhe injury
? he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock
! thus
, the revelation of the
" hero
" as a killer
(
and anti
- hero
) in the final scenes may still prove shocking
,
but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled
. helpfully
, in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation
and muder that have permeated thte film belonged to neal all along
. bu there too is a problem
, as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least
. the story owes us a better underst
anding of franciosa
' s mind
, his concealed madness
and his sudden murderous rampage
. tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies
. for instance
, a teenage boy
and girl leave a hotel room anbd minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike
. we would assume the rider is the same boy
,
but it turns outloud to be some male character we aren
' t even introduced too
! that
' s careless filmmaking
, pure
and simple
. why
, you may ask
, do i go on baout the story
' s flaws
? because when it comes to visuals
and set pieces
, argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world
. take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae
. an upset girl w
andering the streets at nigth needlessly taunts a guard dog to thte point where
- almost unbelievably
- it jumps a high fence
and chases her across town
. finally
, as she desperately seeks escape ffrom this crazed canine
, she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer
' s lair
. it
' s an absolutely masterful sequence
, tense
and exciting
,
and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone
. anbd that
' s exactly thte kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating
. too often
, it seems
, argento
' s films as a hwole are less tahn the sum ofthe their impressive parts
. mind you
, if you love murder mysteries
then tenebrae is still worth a look
.
and if you
' re a fan of argento
' s unique style of giallo thriller thn it
' s essential
. see the uncut widescreen version if you can
and drink in smoe of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli
. it
' s a stylish
, great
- looking
and quirky film despite the problem narrative
. a shame
, because it doesn
' t have to be that way
. take argento
' s more recent stendhal syndrome
( 1992
)
, where with the aid of co
- writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache
. proof that he cxan do it
, if he tries
.
