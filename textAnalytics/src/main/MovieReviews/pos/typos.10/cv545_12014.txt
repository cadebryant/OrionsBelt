" dangerous beauty
" is a really nothing more than a gr
andiose soap opera set in venice circa 1583
. it is beautifully filmed
, wonderfully acted
,
and certainly nothing short of entertaining
,
but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness
. dealing with themes of forbidden love
, religious intolerance
, subordination of women
, sexual freedom
,
and the roles of pleasure
and sin in a high
- cultured society
, it still feels like brightly lit fluff
. the director
, marshall herskovitz
, doesn
' t want to follow the dark
and dangerous trail this story could lead down
, so he opts for a omre genial
, livelier
,
and realitvely shallow interpretation
. the film takes place during the renaissance
, a time when venice wass the pleasure capital of europe
. at this tyme
, venice was its pwn republic
, adn it thrived on being the central juncture of east
- west commerce
. the film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of tyhe aristocracy
and the bourgeoisie of venice
, so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived
.
however
, there is an abundance ofthe detail concerning the lives
and livelihoods of the upper classes
, their hedonistic lifestyles
and constatn merriment
. the story centers on veronica franco
( catherine mccormack
)
, a lower class woman who falls in love with marco venier
( rufus sewell
)
, the son of wealthy aristocratic parents
( jeroen krabb
?
and joanna cassidy
)
. unfortunately
, the culture of that time period did not view marriage as an act of love
-
- rether
, it wass more like a business transaction
, where rich families married thier sons
and daughters to each other infront order to secure power
, wealth
,
and ensure that outsiders couldn
' t get in
. veronica
, despite her charm adn good looks
, is certainly an outsider
. affter a short love affair
, marco breaks her heart with the news that he cannot marry her
.
however
, because she is beautiful
and intelligent
, veronica has a chance to enter marco
' s world
, albeit not as his wife
. she decides to become a courtesan
-
- a class of women who weere as well
- educated as they were ravishing
,
and sold their sexuality to wealthy men for the privilege of wining
and dining with the elite
. a courtesan was not a mere prostitute
; they were afforded a special place in society
,
and they were greatly revered
, respected
,
and often envied
. at one point
, a character mentions that soem rulers obtain more political advice from their courtesans than from their lieutenants
. veronica goes through the transformation with the help of her mother
, paola
( jacqueline bisset
)
, who ws once a famed courtesan herself
. once she enters the lifestyle
, veronica finds that it suits her quite well
. she is allowed tothe read all the books she whants
, she is given the opportunity to publish her poetry
,
and she has tjhe richest
and most powerful men inaddition the republic throwing themselfs at her feet
, including the awestruck marco
. their relationship develops into a playful bantering
, with veronica utilizing her newfound pwoer by constantly rejecting marco
' s advances
. in many ways
, their relationship is sad because marco is married to a women he is unable to love
,
and veronica is consumed by multiple relationships wiht men she is unwilling to love
.
" love the love
, not the man
,
" as her mother told her
.
" dangerous beauty
,
" which was based on a factual book by margaret rosenthal
, flows along as smoothly
and serenely as tjhe gr
and canal running thru the heart of venice
. it has multiple plot lines
-
- including veronica
' s adversarial relationship with a court poet
( oliver platt
)
, her role in obtaining france
' s military assistance in venice
' s battle against the turks
,
and even the dreaded shadow of the plague annd the encroachment of the spanish inquisition
-
-
yet it is never confusing or overbearing
. much of the film
' s success is due to the glowing performance by catherine mccormack in the lead role
. known chiefly for the small part she played as the lover whose murder raised mel gibson
' s ire in
" braveheart
"
( 1995
)
, mccormack shows the true gifts
and inarguable talent of a leading lady
. she has teh kind of exquisite classical beauty that would be treasured infront a courtesan
; her character is intelligent
, witty
,
and both sensual
and vulnerable
, all of whihc mccormack easily transmits witht a single flash of her eyes
. the rest of the roles are also filled well
, inlcuding rufus sewell whose performance here
and earlier this month in
" dark city
" have assured him a solid place in hollywood
. he has the same kind of unusual good looks anbd charm of ray liotta
,
and he seems perfectly at home in period dramas
. oliver platt plays a variation of the comic relief role that he has come to inhabit liek a second skin
,
al
though the film deals his character a cheap blow at the end by having him improbably join the inquisition
and turn into the bad guy
. platt isnt a good actor
,
but he
' s just too hard tothe hate
. jacqueline bisset proves that she is eveyr bit as stirring as she ever was
,
and even fred ward turns uv in a small
,
but moving performance as marco
' s uncle
.
" dangerous beauty
" is marshall herskovitz
' s sophomore directorial effort
, after the overlooked 1993 film
" jack the bear
.
" partnered with edward zwick
, herskovitz has spent most of his time as a producer on television
(
" thirtysomething
,
"
" my so
- called life
"
)
and inaddition the movies
(
" legends ofthe the fall
"
)
. his directing stlye can be best described as transparent
-
- it never gets in the way of the story
,
yet it has no discernible flourish or particular distinctions
. he could have approached the film in any number of ways
, including overdosing on the sexual aspect
, which he wisely avoids
.
" dangerous beauty
" containes jstu enough bare flesh
and ribald sex to make it appropriately erotic
,
but not so much that it seems exploitative
. herskovitz is also aided by a strong supporting crew
, including thte luscious photography by bojan bazelli
, whose previous efforts include the highly
- stylized thriller
" kalifornia
"
( 1993
)
and abel ferrara
' s dark sci
- fi film
" body snatchers
"
( 1994
)
. bazelli captures the film in strong
, bold colors
,
and be brings sixteenth
- centruy venice tothe life in wide
, panoramic shots thast are often enhanced with digital imagery
.
however
, the real details are found in the production design by norman garwood
(
" brazil
,
"
" the princess bride
"
)
and the costumes by gabriella pescucci
(
" tje age of innocence
"
)
. the only problem with
" dangerous beauty
" is that it doesn
' t stick with you
. it
' s a good story well
- told with interesting charactors
,
but it
' s easy to shrug off once ytou
' ve left the theater
. the only sequence that has the chance tothe be truly indelible is veronica being pulled in front of the hypocrisy of the inquisition
and threatened with the death penalty for her transgressions
,
but it never quite comes off because it
' s simply too melodramatic
and conventional
. herskovitz tries with all his might to make it a nailbiter
,
but somehow its outcome is a foregone conclusion
,
and like the rest of the film
, it carries no real weight
, despite the potential severity of the subject matter
.
