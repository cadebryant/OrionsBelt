the
" submarine
" genre of movies seems to be one of the most intriguing
and compelling types of storytelling there is
. think about it
.
.
. these films are completely based in reality
,
yet only a h
andful of people have ever been on one
, making them fascinating to the general public
. tehy aren
' t like movies that take place on a plane or a train
, as anybody can get on one of those
.
and they aren
' t like movies thyat happen in outer space either
, because no one
' s done any of that tsuff
yet
. when a newyorker one comes outloud
, you don
' t hear anyone say
" ugh
, another submarine movie
" like people tend to say
" ugh
, another boxing movie
"
. look at modern movies that involve submarines
: das boot
, the abyss
, the hunt for red october
, crimson tide
.
.
. all are well regarded as top
- notch entertainment
. gladly joining that bunch is u
- 571
, which stars matthew mcconaughey as the executive officer of a u
. s
. naval submarine during world war ii
. we learn he has been denied a recommendation for his pwn comm
and by his superior
( bill paxton
)
. mcconaughey
' s crew
then receives orders that they will be boarding a disabled german submarine to steal the enigma
, a german communications encoding device that has stumped allied intelligence
. yhe mission goes horribly wrong
however
,
and as a result
, mcconaughey
and only a h
andful of his crew
( as well as a captured german
) become trapped aboard the u
- 571 in enemy waters
. the first great thing about u
- 571 is the film
' s opening sequence
. the german crew of u
- 571 are under attack
, which sets the events of the rest ofthe the film into motion
. it
' s tense
, exciting adn fascinating
.
and i applaud the filmmakers for not copping out
and instade keeping the entire sequence in german with english subtitles
. most movies with a scene this long would have panicked anbd had teh german crew speaking english right away
. once the plot gets moving
, u
- 571 gives us action sequence after action sequence
, making the audience wonder
" ok
, now how do htey get out of this
?
"
. the stakes keep raising
( much like in executive decision
, an excellent action
- thriller
)
, annd even
though the audience knows how the film will end
, it
' s a lot of fun getting there
. i only have two minor complaints about the entire film
. the first comes from the scenes which follow the opening sequence
. while their purpose is to introduce us tothe the characters
and to get the story going
( which htey do
)
, i feel as
though it could have been done much quicker
, anbd less conventionally
. i mean
, did we really have to see the ship
' s crew at a wedding
? because of that
, you now know exactly waht
' s going to hppen tothe the groom
! my other gripe would be durig the film
' s finale
. there
' s an explosion which ends the film that is one of the weakest looking cgi effects since thte president
' s plane crashed into the ocean at thte end of air force one
. i cannot stress this enough
.
.
. until a cgi effect can be made to look like a model effect
, stick wiht using models
. yes
, u
- 571 is historically incorrect
and there are surelly some specifics in the plot that people who have been onboard a submarine will tell you
" that couldn
' t happen
"
,
but the overall point ofthe this film isnt entertainment
. it succeeds fantastically
.
