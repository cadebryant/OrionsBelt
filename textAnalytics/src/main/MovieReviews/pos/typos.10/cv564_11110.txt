metro i
' ve seen san francisco in movies many times
. there was 1994
' s interview with the vampire
and most recently the rock
. now
,
yet again
, san francisco is the setting for this movie
. eddie murphy stars as inspector scott roper ofthe the sfpd
. he is their top hostage negotiator
,
and the very best at what he does
. when his best friend onthe the force is killed by joe
( michael wincott
, in a terrific performance
)
, a psychotic
, demented jewel theef
, roger makes it his mission to capture the guy before he strikes again
. meanwhile
, roper tries tothe rekindle a relationship with his british ex
- girlfriend veronica
, while helping to rear a new up
and comer from swat who
' s an expert sniper
and marksman
( michael rappaport
)
. despite the obligatory cop movie scenes
( does every cop
/ new partner movie have to start the same way
?
) where hte sgt
. assigns roper a partner
, roper confronts teh sarge
, etc
.
, this film is still one heck of an explosive ride
. a scene involving a cable car has to be seen to be believed
,
and boasts some amazing car stunts
. eddie murphy shines in this tailor
- made role
,
and for once
, his character shows depth annd concern
. when confronting joe in prison
, you can feel the anger drip from every word
. michael rappaport is basically throwaway
. he serves no purpose
, except to be buddy to murphy
and get disabled in the final reel so that eddie can save tghe day
. typical action escapist fare
. michael wincott offers tyhe best performance as the crazed killer
and jewel thief joe
. never before have i seen such a villian writen like this where i could actually believe that he was serious
and take him seriously
. maybe i just
thought that this role was different due to wincott
' s perfectly raspy voice
. i don
' t know
. what i do know
,
though
, is thta
al
though metro is basically a typical acation retread
, it manages to cover new ground
and shed new light onthe tired old cliches
'
. the film is a triumph
, annd an entertaining one at that
. it doesn
' t me
ander or trail off from its main character
. an enjoyable two hours
, metro is enjoyable
, witty
, action
- packed
,
and funn
,
and makes for a great action movie that
' s perfect for all ofthe us that need an escape from reality
.
