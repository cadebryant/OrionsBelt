jerry springer has got nothing onthe
" wild things
.
" john mcnaughton
' s new thriller tackles more tawdry themes in less thna two hours than springer
' s notoriously sleazy talk show broadcasts in twpo weeks
-
- bisexuality
, threesomes
, poolside catfights
, slutty rich bimbos
, even redneck gator
- wrestling
, they
' re all part of the movie
' s raucous
, complex storyline
.
but even trash tv topicality can
' t drag
" wild things
" down
-
- this crazy campfest plays like something you
' d find late
- night on the usa network
, onyl infinitely more palatable
and with a solid ensemble casted
. despite a smattering of needless scenes
( most of them sexual in nature
)
, ther
' s wicked fun to be had here
.
" wild things
" would be a guilty pleasure
, only htere
' s no gilty feeling involved in having a good time with it
. high school guidance counselor sam lombardo
( matt dillon
) is well
- liked in the town of blue bay
, especially by pretty
, popular kelly van ryan
( denise richards
)
, whose family name is among the florida yachting enclave
' s most financially prominent
. hoping to take her crush to a physical level
, kelly seductively slinks into lombardo
' s house after washing his jeep for a fundraiser
,
but
, the very enxt day
, tearfully admits to her trollop mother
( theresa russell
) that she was raped
. before long
, blue bay detectives ray duquette
( kevin bacon
)
and gloria perez
( daphne rubin
- vega
) are listening to similair allegations from kelly
' s rebel classmate suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
. lombardo
, who maintains his innocence
, hires neck brace
- sporting
, opportunistic lawyer ken bowden
( bill murray
) to defend him in court
. the previews give away the following revelations
, so if yuo haven
' t seen any of the movie
' s spots on the television or in the theater
, you might want tothe skip to the next paragraph
. while cross
- examining suzie on the witness st
and
, bowden gets her to break down
and admit tht the alleged rapes never took place
-
- that kelly had concocted this entire scheme becuase she was angry that lombardo was sleeping with her mother
and not with her
. to pay lombardo for the damages
, kelly
' s mother breaks her daughter
' s trust fund
and gives him
$ 8
. 5 million
. bu lombardo
, kelly
and suzie are actually all working together
,
and plan to take the monay
and run as fast as they can
. duquette
and perez
,
however
, begin to suspect that there
' s more afoot to the case than just false accusations
. if there
' s a major drawback to
" wild things
,
" it
' s that it
' s oversexed to a fault
. the much
- talked
- about hotel room menage
- a
- trois betwen dillon
, campbell
and richards is a turn
- off
. it
' s aslo cut short
( sorry
, guys
)
,
and should have been cut shorter
-
- the movie grinds to a halt fo pure titillation once too often
. what we don
' t see is far more effective than what we do
. anohter example of this is kevin bacon needlessly going the full monty in a shower scene
. er
, no thanks
. also
, bacon
' s duquette feels simultaneously underdeveloped
and overwritten
. daphne rubin
- vega
, from broadway
' s
" rent
,
" tries to compensate fo a superfluous character
. theresa russell is just plain wooden
.
and when
, in yhe end
, all is outloud in the open
, ask yourself if certain scenes involving theese three were really necessary
.
but what keeps the movie from being throwaway junk isnt an engaging chain ofthe surprises
( some predictable
, some nto
) that never seems to end
.
" wild things
" has omre twists tahn a crate full of corkscrews
,
and most are so gleefully
, over
- the
- top nasty that you can
' t help
but be charmed by their absurd showmanship
. a great deal of amusement also comes from watching bill murray in a supporting part that appears to have been written for his sly comedic talent
; murray
' s a stitch
, especially when pulling up beside the van ryan limo after winning lombardo
' s case
and flipping them off
.
and don
' t leave when the closing credits hit the screen
, or you
' ll miss the film
' s best part
-
- four bonus flashbacks that smooth over plot holes while offering a few more tiny turns
, plus a fianl scene that caps everything off with a great stunner of a bombshell
. speaking of bombshells
, denise richards
, who plays almost every scene in a blue bikini top
, doesnt the teen tease thing with a malicious allure that she was never allowed to flaunt in
" starship troopers
.
" matt dillon flexes his sleepy
- voiced sex appeal
,
and puls off personality changes with chameleonic precision
. neve campbell
, lovely as ever except when sporting a blond wig
, gives suzie a vengeful vulnerability that makes her hte most interesting member of the conspiring trio
. re
- edited
and toned down a bit
, the dynamics between these three actors could have carried the film to greater lengths
.
but what we
' re given works well enough
.
" wild things
" is highly entertaining
and
, indeed
, very wild
.
