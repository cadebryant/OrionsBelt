let me open this one with a confession
: i love cop movies
. i adore them with such an unwavering
, near foolish passion that i was actually one of the frist in line to see 1998
' s one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brothers
, steven
. was it any good
? well
, just about as good as baldwin
' s steven seagal impression
( for thsoe i
' ve confused the answer is a resounding no
!
)
. now let me clarify
, i don
' t love just any cop movie
; i
' m not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80
' s
and nowe slowly
( gulp
) returning thanks to jackie chan
and chris tucker
. i
' m partial to thsoe gritty
, earthy cop dramas like serpico
, donnie brasco
,
and the french connection
. problem isnt these films come along just baout as often as george w
. bush makes a cogent point so whenever a
" true
" cop movie does hit multiplexes
, i come running towards it like an eager puppy
?
?
?
and inevitably i leave
, head bowed
, tripping over my squiggly tail
. so what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out
$ 7
. 50 for a movie called one tough cop
( whcih actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spin
- off
, no
?
)
? truth is i
' m a sucker for thsoe barren streets
, that gritty
, graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk
and cops
, like modern day knights
, must shield us ffrom their iniquitous clutches
. yes it
' s all very corny
and awfully boys clubish
, which
, i
' m guessing
, is precisely where these feelings come from
. as little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars wih gi joe
' s
, enact cops
and robbers or cowboy anbd indian fantasies
, etc
. the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolesent fantasies
,
and heighten them
, turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines
and psychological chaos
. as an adult my tastes haven
' t changed all that drastically
; sure i cant get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities ofthe a krzysztof kieslowski film
,
but i still delight at the promise a
" guy
" film could potentially bring
. now what if it
' s the cops who
' re the corrupt ones
? ooh that one really gets me gogin
, these protectors useing all that at their service
, taking advantage ofthe others for their own gain
. throw a courtroom drama
( yech
!
) into the pot
and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city
. how absorbing is prince of the city
, you ask
? so damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama
( a sub
- genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar
) i remained completely
and utterly involved
. the film stars treat williams
, who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the levle that brad pitt currently resides at
. since i was hatched a mere two yersa prior to the release of prince of the city
, i cannot provide an answer as to why it didn
' t
.
(
though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising adn dead heat i would guess that it probably has something tothe do with quite a few bad career moves
)
. like mickey rourke
and eric roberts
( both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory
) williams is a talented leading man who didn
' t make it to where he shoud have
.
( if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished tothe direct to video hell
)
. here
, the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacino
' s in serpico
( also directed by lumet
)
. williams plays danny ciello
, a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty pre
- juliani streets of new york
. tehy work without uniforms or hours much liek paide vigilantes
.
and that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means tothe get the job done
. the squad relies entirely on informants
( low level junkies
) to gain access tothe the big wigs
,
and in order to obtain the info they seek
, they sometimes have to provide hte junkies with the junk of their choise
. danny has done this
,
and
though he
' s a fairly honorable guy
, who took the job in order to do good
, his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way
. he seeks redemption
and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by tlaking to internal affairs who
then convince him tothe go undercover as a
" double agent
"
. he does so witht one condition
: he will not rat on his partners
. right away we konw that that is exactly what he
' ll have to do
. adn watching the movie build tothe that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be
. undercover cop films are allmost innately exciting
, even the kind that pull out all tyhe cliches
( like in too deep
)
. how can one not be moved by thge issues of betrayal
, ambiguity
, anbd the danger in putting oneself inwhich such a risky position
? prince ofthe the city takes all this
and charges it with a perceptive
, hard boiled script
and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet
, as well as a h
andful of intense performances
, most notably by treat
. lumet
' s greatest contri
bution to the movie is how he lays back
,
and lets the camera soak up the action
. his scenes transition rapidly from one tothe the next building layers of tension
,
and he rarely holds for reaction shots
, instead he clicks away at precisely the moent a character stops yakking
. lumet
' s worst tendency is one that many film makers
( especially oliver stone
) tend to overuse
: he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order tothe ratchet up the tension
. this isn
' t as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan
, lumet
' s most recent cop
\ lawyer endeavor
, a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching
.
though of late lumet has made several really awful career choices
( maybe he
and treat should get together for a drink or something
)
, the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria
, here he was on
, sustaining tension in a film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot
. some of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic
. hollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable
. of course cop movies aren
' t popular anymore
( yes buddy cop ficks are popular
but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines
)
,
but just look at the average hollywood action movies
, flicks so bloated
and full ofthe unnecessary fat liek the boring love interest that serves no purpose otehr than to stall teh action
and demonstrate that our hero isn
' t gay
, the lame comic relief character who
' s never funny
,
and on
and on
. for all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a back to the basics cop
\ courtroom drama tht leaves out all the crap
and really thrills
. it focuses completely on its story
, adn its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to tyhe junkies
. there
' s a gerat scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer
and looks as if he
' s about to go into one of thsoe corny braveheart inspirational speeches
,
but instead he breaks down in front of the cop
and begins sobbing
. this is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film
( even
though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon
, not one damn tear
) it would be cut outloud because the directer would say oh that makes him too human
, excuse me
, weak
. in the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness
, straining to get the words out
. he
' s lost his voice
. doens that little itty bitty detail matter
? maybe not to most
, bu it sure made my night
. anbd in a sprawling epic of corruption
, greed
, betrayal
and violence it
' s nice to see that someone isnt paying attention to the little things
.
