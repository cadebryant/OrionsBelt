, kenneth williams excels as the evil camembert
,
and peter
butterworth expertly plays teh substantial part ofthe camembert
' s thick
- witted crony
. otehr acting honours go to joan sims who is perfect as desiree adn charles hawtrey who is excellent as thge french aristo pommfrit

al
though it suffers from a disasterously over
- long sword fight at the end of the film
, it isnt largely successful due to the performances of the main stars
, its slick
and professional production
,
and its better
- than
- usual script
. definitely one of the best ofthe the series
and a joy to watch
.
