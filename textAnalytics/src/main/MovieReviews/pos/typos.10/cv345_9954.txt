alien 3 isnt the only alien film i have seen inspite theaters
. i saw it when i was 13 years old
,
and i must admit that i didn ' t like it
. of course
, i was expecting aliens again
,
and i believe this was my fault
. in order to appreciate alien 3
, you need tothe see aliens
,
but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor
. james cameron ' s aliens was an action film
,
and many people consider it the best in the series
. i am among thyat group
,
but alien 3 is an extremely intertaining film
, which critics have bashed for its originality
. many thought the final chase scene whent on for too long
,
and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue
and not enough action
. both are untrue
, because thge film has quite a bit of action
,
and the dialogue was essential
and well
- written
. as for the chase sequence
, it was long
,
but not overly long
, creating quite a bit ofthe suspense ffrom confusion
. perhaps watching alien 3 on video helped
. on the big screen
, i was overwhelmed by something i normaly didn ' t see
. it was a vrey dark film
,
and the language was extremely harsh
. i had always figured yhe alien series to rely onthe smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities
. don ' t get me wrong
-
- i ' m not saying films should eliminate swearing
,
but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks
, it gets rether distracting
.
however
, since seeing it again
, i realize thta the swearing is mainly jstu an aspect ofthe the restrained hatred in the characters
. as a result
, alien 3 ' s only flaw
( albeit a major one
) is the underdeveloped characters
. we never really care about any of them
,
and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length ofthe the movie
. there were only two characters i liked
,
adn of course one was lt
. ripley
( sigourney weaver
)
,
allthough we have gotten to nkow her through two otehr films
. the other character was dr
. clemens
( charles dance
)
,
but because we like him
, yhe inevitable occurs
. alien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off
. the prologue of alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher
, who had onyl directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry
. without using a single line of dialogue
( unless you count computer warnings
)
, fincher sets up the entire film
. an impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film befor cutting to a title kard
. we see lt
. ripley
and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments
.
.
.
( title
)
.
.
. a shot ofthe an alien egg
.
.
.
( title
)
.
.
. alien legs stretch up into the air
.
.
.
( title
)
.
.
.
and so on
adn so on
. during these first ten mintues
, i learned everything i had tothe in order for alien 3 tothe proceed
. it ' s quite a remarkable opening
,
and one which iwll remain in my mind for a long time
. because of this face
- hugger which hasnt been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens
, the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod
,
adn sent down to the nearest planet
: fiorina fury
- 161
, an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison
.
however
, the face
- hugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryo
- tubes
,
and is sent down with the escape pod
. unfortunately
, durring the landing
, all
but one of the survivors from aliens is killed
. ripley is discovered by some of the inmates
and taked back tothe the refinery
. of course
, you ened a carrier for this face
- hugger
,
and it attachs itself to the dog whcih came with the team of inmates
. ripley is revived
and asks to see the ship
. after seeing a mysterious acid
- eaten section
, ripley asks to see the dead bodies
,
anbd
then have them cremated
. this cremation scene is one of the most powerful
and impressive of all the alien films
. featuring a monologue from dillon
( charles s
. dutton
)
, a prisoner who has found god
, the movie cuts back
and forth from the ceremony to the dog ' s demise
. it ' s one of the most memorable moments
, as the speech reflects exactly waht is going on with thge dog
.
and this is where alien 3 succeeds
. fincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films
,
and i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock
( in fact
, he is the mixture of both
)
. fincher knows exactly what to film
and how to film it
,
and i figure that he will be oney of the few directors with complete controll over his films
. alien 3 is riddled with symbolic speeches
and metaphorical images
. by doing so
, fincher creates some of tghe best scenes in tje entire alien franchise
. many people have criticized fincher ' s filming of the death scene of ripley
( i reveal nothing by saying this
) as looking too fake
,
but i enjoy
and relish in the portrayal
. showing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch
,
but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron
, a great dael of symbolism is derived
. i feel that it would have spoiled the mood of tghe entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron
.
however
, most people seem tothe want to witness ripley dieu
( which creates a paradox
, as she is tyhe character i didn ' t wanna to see die
)
. why she is killed is one of the surprises of the film
,
and i don ' t plan on spoiling that in this review
.
> from every alien film comes several memorable moments whlch seem to stick with you forever
. in alien
, it ws
, of course
, the moment the alien burst out of kane ' s stomach
. in aliens
, it was the showdown between alien
and ripley in a machine
. alien 3 has several
,
but most memorable is tjhe terrific shot involving the alien
and ripley
. ripley is pushed up against a wall
,
and the alien stands inches away from her
. why it doesn ' t kill her is a shocker
, which later leads to a surprise ending
. fincher apparently loves to use close
- ups of actors ' faces
( michael douglas
and the clown face
- off in the game in the same style
)
,
anbd by shaving off the actors ' hair
, the only thing we have tothe look at is their faces
. many critics didn ' t like all the actors being bald
,
but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot
. most of alien 3 works when you take it infront context of tjhe story
,
but when you try to compare it to its predecessors
, fincher ' s turn seems a bited gloomy
and dark
,
though taht ' s not always a bad thing
. tghe plot is pretty much a rehash of the first two films
, witht smoe major twists
. again
, we are setup with several different characters
,
and one by one
, they are picked off
.
however
, while the first two had tons of arsenal
( especialy cameron ' s film
)
, alien 3 takes place onthe a planet devoid of human life except for this run
- down prison
. as a result
, no weapons are to be found
. this creates a lot ofthe tension
,
although i must admit that fincher coudl have added a lot more suspense
. as an alien film
, alien 3 isnt the worst of the series
,
but by itself
, it isnt an extremely well
- made motion picture
, with a lot more merits than not
. yhe unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel is teh one
- dimensional characters
. i never was really emotionally involved on screen beacuse most of the characters are hardcore criminals whom i really could care less about
. dispite this
, ripley was the central figure
,
and that ' s what is important
. we care for her
, even
though she began to act jstu like one of the guys
. again
, the technical side of this film is remarkable
,
annd better than the twpo previous versions
. while cameron ' s version was a pumped up acation film with massive artillary
, fincher uses brilliant camera angles
, terrific lighting
,
and moody sets
. the cinematography
, by alex thomson
, is very well done
, with a terrific chase sequence towards the end of the movie
. thte confusion of the ending draws the viewer in
, as we are just as confused as the actors who are bieng chased around
. the yellows
, reds
,
and oranges of the lights create a dark mood
,
and by themselves create a lot of suspense
. shadows dance on the walls
,
and
yet those shadows sould easily be the aline
. the alien is different from its predecessors this time around
,
and the swiftness ofthe thsi alien is quite intense
. the camera likes to tkae up the prespective of the alien
, racing after the characters
. the sets are quite incredible
, which are reminiscient of the nostromo from alien
. the narrow corridors
and labrynthine hallways isnt well constructed
. the sets appear to be in the future
,
but not too far in the future
. one of the set pieces even aids in the destruction of the alien
( nothing surprising there
)
. sigourney weaver turns out
yet another good performance
, equaling her protrayal of ripley in aliens
. she was snubbed at the oscars for this one
, mainly because the film was a critical bomb
. her reactions are far more realistic inthe this film
, with her crying over the loss ofthe yhe littel child she risked her life saveing in her previous encounter
. it ' s quite touching really
. charles s
. dutton is very strong in his peformance as one of the inmates
,
and i was on the brink of actualy caring for him
. charles dance turns in a nice low
- key performance
,
and as a result
, i cared fo him immediately
. lance henriksen makes a brief appearance as bishop ii
,
but he was more entertaining in aliens
. the rest of the cast is pretty stale
,
though pete postlethwaite sticks out due to his recent turns in the usual suspects
and the lost world
. alien 3 is rated r for strong violence
anbd language
,
and sex
.
although it has its flaws
, alien 3 is highly entertaining with rich symbolism
. this film reminds you how much fun it is to spot metaphoricial images throughout a movie
. while kubrick may have a moral message throughout his films
, fincher relies on cinematic devices to bring his meanings outloud
. it ' s a film like fincher ' s which reminds us that it is okay forthe a film to sacrifice quality fo quantaty
( the final scene
)
. in fact
, it tells us that we
, as a society
, have become too critical of things which may happen to look a little
" fake
.
" whenever something looks fake on screen
, we immidiately point it out as a mistake
.
but perhaps it isn ' t a mistake
.
