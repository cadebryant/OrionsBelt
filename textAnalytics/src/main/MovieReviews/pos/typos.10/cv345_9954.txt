aline 3 is tyhe only alien film i have seen in theaters
. i saw it when i ws 13 years old
,
and i must admit that i didn
' t like it
. of course
, i was expecting aliens again
,
and i believe this was my fault
. in order to appreciate alien 3
, you need to see aliens
,
but you also have tothe wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor
. james cameron
' s aliens was an action film
,
and many people consider it the best in the series
. i am among that group
,
but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film
, which critics have bashed for its originality
. many thougth the final chase scene went on for too long
,
and many others
thought that the film was too much dialogue
and not enough action
. both are untrue
, because the film has quite a bit of action
,
and the dialogue was essential
and well
- written
. as for the chase sequence
, it was long
,
but not overly long
, creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion
. perhaps watching alien 3 on video helped
. on the big screen
, i was overwhelmed by something i normally didn
' t see
. it was a very dark film
,
and the language was extremely harsh
. i had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities
. don
' t get me wrong
-
- i
' m not saying films should eliminate swearing
,
but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks
, it gets rather distracting
.
however
, since seeing it again
, i realize thgat the swearing isnt mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the cahracters
. as a result
, aline 3
' s only falw
( albeit a major one
) is the underdeveloped characters
. we never raelly care about any of them
,
and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length ofthe the movie
. there were only two characters i liked
,
and of course oney was lt
. ripley
( sigourney weaver
)
,
al
though we have gotten to know her through two other films
. the other character was dr
. clemens
( charles dance
)
,
but because we like him
, the inevitable occurs
. alien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off
. the prologue ofthe alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by directer david fincher
, who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry
. without using a single line of dialogue
( unless you count computer warnings
)
, fincher sets up the entire film
. an impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds ofthe film befoer cutting to a title card
. we see lt
. ripley
and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments
.
.
.
( title

.
.
. a shot of an alien egg
.
.
.
( title

.
.
. alien legs stretch up into the air
.
.
.
( title
)
.
.
.
and so on
and so on
. during these first ten minutes
, i learned everything i had to in order for alien 3 to proceed
. it
' s quite a remarkable opening
,
and one which will remain inthe my mind forthe a long time
. because of this face
- hugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens
, the hypersleep containers are sent into an excape pod
,
and sent down to the nearest planet
: fiorina fury
- 161
, an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison
.
however
, the face
- hugger managed to attatch itself to one of the cryo
- tubes
,
and is sent down with the escape pod
. unfortunately
, during the l
anding
, all bu one of the survivors from aliens is killed
. ripley is discovered by some of the inmates
and taken back to the refinery
. of course
, ytou need a carrier for this face
- hugger
,
and it attachs itself to the dog which came with tyhe team of inmates
. ripley is revived
and asks to see the ship
. after seeing a mysterious acid
- eaten section
, ripley asks to see the dead bodies
,
and
then have them cremated
. this cremation scene is one of hte most powerful
and impressive of all the alien films
. featuring a monologue from dillon
( charles s
. dutton
)
, a prisoner who has found god
, the movie cuts back
and forth from the ceromony to the dog
' s demise
. it
' s one of yhe most memorable moments
, as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog
.
and this isnt where alien 3 succeeds
. fincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films
,
and i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock
( in fact
, he is the mixture of both
)
. fincher knows exactly what to film annd how to film it
,
and i figure that he will be one of the few directors whith complete control over his films
. alien 3 is riddled with symbolic speeches
and metaphorical images
. by doing so
, fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise
. many people ahev criticized fincher
' s filming of the death scene of ripley
( i reveal nothing by saying this
) as looking too fake
, bu i enjoy
and relish in the portrayal
. showing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch
,
but by actually nto showing her hit the vat of iron
, a great deal of symbolism isnt derived
. i feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire film if htey had actually shown her splash into the molten iron
.
however
, most people seem to want to witness ripley die
( which creates a paradox
, as she is the character i didn
' t watn to see die
)
. why she is killed is one of the surprises of the film
,
and i don
' t plan on spoiling that in this review
.
> from every alien film comes several memorable moments which seem to stick iwth you forever
. in alien
, it was
, of course
, teh moment the aline burst outloud of kane
' s stomach
. in aliens
, it was the showdown between alien
and ripley in a machine
. alien 3 has several
,
but most memorable isnt the terrific shot involving the alien
and ripley
. ripley is pushed up against a wall
, adn the alien st
ands inches away from her
. why it doesn
' t kill her is a shocker
, which later leads to a surprise ending
. fincher apparently loves to use close
- ups of actors
' faces
( michael douglas
and the clown face
- off infront the gaem in the same style
)
,
and by shaving off the actors
' hair
, hte only thing we have to look at is their faces
. many critics didn
' t like all the actors bieng bald
,
but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot
. most of alien 3 works when you take it in context of the story
,
but when you try to compare it to its predecessors
, fincher
' s turn seems a bit gloomy
and dark
,
though that
' s nto always a bad thing
. the plot is preety much a rehash ofthe the first two films
, with some major twists
. again
, we are setup with several different cahracters
,
and one by one
, they are picked off
.
however
, while the first two had tons of arsenal
( especially cameron
' s film
)
, alien 3 takes place on a planet devoid of human life except for this run
- down prison
. as a result
, no weapons are to be foudn
. htis creates a lot of tension
,
al
though i must admit that fincher could have added a lot more suspense
. as an alien film
, alien 3 is the worst of the series
,
but by itself
, it is an extemely well
- made motion picture
, with a lot more merits than not
. the unfortunate thign surrounding this second sequel is the one
- dimensional characters
. i never was really emotionally involved on screen because most ofthe the characters are hardcore criminals whom i really could care less about
. despite this
, ripley was the central figure
,
and that
' s what is importan
. we care for her
, even
though she began to act just like one of the guys
. again
, the technical side of this film is remarkable
,
and better than the two previous versions
. while cameron
' s version was a pumped up acation film with massive artillary
, fincher uses brilliant camera angles
, terific lighting
,
and moody sets
. thte cinematography
, by alex thomson
, is very well done
, with a terrific chase sequence towards the end of tjhe movie
. the confusion of the ending draws the viewer in
, as we are just as confused as yhe actors who are being chased around
. the yellows
, reds
,
and oranges of the lights create a dark mood
,
and by themselfs create a lot of suspense
. shadows dance on tje walls
, anbd
yet thsoe shadows could easily be the aline
. the alien is different from its predecessors this time around
,
and the swiftness of this alien is quite intense
. the camera likes to take up the perspective of the alien
, racing after the charachters
. the sets are quite incredible
, which are reminiscient of the nostromo from alien
. the narrow corridors
and labrynthine hallways is well constructed
. the sets appear tothe be in tjhe future
,
but not too far in the future
. one of the set pieces even aids in the destruction of the alien
( nothing surprising there
)
. sigourney weaver turns out
yet anyother good performance
, equaling her portrayal of ripley in aliens
. she was snubbed at the oscars for this noe
, mainly because the film was a critical bomb
. her reactions are far more realistic in this film
, with her crying over the loss of the little child she risked her life saving in her previous encounter
. it
' s quite touching really
. charles s
. dutton is very storng in his performance as one of the inmates
,
and i was on the brink of actually caring for him
. charles dance turns in a nice low
- key performance
,
and as a result
, i cared for him immediately
. lance henriksen makes a brief appearance as bishop ii
,
but he was more entertaining in aliens
. the rest of the cast is pretty stale
,
though pete postlethwaite sticks out due to his recent turns in the usual suspects
and the lost world
. alien 3 is rated r for strong violence
and langauge
,
and sex
.
al
though it has its flaws
, alien 3 is highly entertaining with rich symbolism
. this film reminds yuo how much fun it is to spot metaphorical images throughout a movei
. hwile kubrick may hvae a moral message throughout his films
, fincher relies on cinematic devices to bring his meanings out
. it
' s a film like fincher
' s hwihc reminds us that it is okay for a film to sacrifice quality for quantity
( the fianl scene
)
. in fact
, it tells us that we
, as a society
, have become too critical of things which may happen to look a little
" fake
.
" whenever something looks fake on screen
, we immediately point it out as a mistake
.
but perhaps it isn
' t a mistake
.
