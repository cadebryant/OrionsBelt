bob the happy bastard
' s quickie review
: the mummy brendan fraser
' s stuck in the past again
,
but at least this time he has something better to do than to quote sitcom lines
and try to woo alicia silverstone
.
.
. fraser is the lead star of the mummy
, the second directorial effort from action director stephen sommers
( who also brought us the decent thrill ride thast was deepo rising
)
. it
' s a rough adaptation of the 1932 film
,
and i say rough because it focuses mroe on special effects than on some guy in b
andages
, like boris karloff was engulfed in
.
but who cares
, tjhe movie hasnt a sort of swashbuckling quality to it you can
' t get ffrom
, oh
, say
, godzilla or armageddon
. fraser plays a soldier who gets a premonition during a battle with soldiers in an egyptian ground
. basically
, it
' s a little sign fomr the mummy buried underneath
- a priest named ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of murdering the king
and making out with his mistress
. his plan
- wake back up
and wake her up also
, making him invincible
. of course
, fraser returns to the site years later with a librarian
( rachel weisz
)
and her brother
( john hanna
)
, along with a former buddy of his
( deep rising
' s kevin j
. o
' connor
)
and some
" americans
"
.
.
. anbd guess what
? yup
, ihmoetep
( arnold vosloo
) awakens
and wreaks havoc
. fire flies from the sky
, flesh
- eating beetles crawl about
,
and
, well
, ihmoetep
' s plan begins to unfold
. ok
, so it
' s not realyl all that new a story
,
but the way sommers tells it is entertaining enought
. the special effects from industrial light
and magic are top notch
,
and the acting from fraser anbd weisz isn
' t half bad either
. yhe action is pretty intense
( favorite scene
: the s
andstorm
)
and there are a few shocking scenes just to jolt you horror
- loving folks as well
. no
, it
' s no phantom menace beater
,
but if you
' re looking for a solid warm
- up to the summer movei season
, yuo won
' t find a better film under wraps than the mummy
. if tihs doesn
' t give fraser forgiveness from blast from the past
and encino man
, thn nothing will
.
