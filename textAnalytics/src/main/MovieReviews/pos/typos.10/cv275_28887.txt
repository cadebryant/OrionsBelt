after the press screening of
" moulin rouge
,
" i stood in the lobby of the theater listening to the reactions of my firends
and colleagues
. everyone seemed a bit numb
, underst
andable aftter sitting through a barrage of often
- incongruous sounds
and images
. a pal of mine simply said that he loved the film
and could hardly wait to tkae his wife to see it
. another enthusiast immediately began to analyze the production
, while a woman who flat
- out hated the movie gave him the skunk eye
. when one fellow quitely stated
" i
' ve never really been a fan of musicals
,
" the statement surprised me because
, even
though tghe story is told almost completely through song
, i didn
' t think ofthe it as a musical
. there is so much going on in
" moulin rouge
" that
" musical
" seems too small a term to cover it
.
" moulin rouge
" is the kind ofthe creation that sends critics scurrying off tothe the big tub o
' adjectives infront search ofthe proper words to describe tghe experience
. australian director baz luhrmann
, the man behind
" strictly ballroom
"
and
" romeo
+ juliet
,
" fills the heads of viewers with unique camerawork
, opulent imagery
and songs ranging from
" the sound of music
" to
" smells like teen spirit
.
" sumptuous
and beautiful
, vulgar
and overdone
,
" moulin rogue
" travels through the looking glass hwile an ethereal stereo loaded with 50 eyasr worth of catchy tunes operates on teh
" r
andom
" setting
. oh
,
and it has a story as well
.
" it was 1899
, the summer of love
.
.
.
" christian
( ewan mcgregor
) is a penniless young writer newly arrived in paris
,
" to write about truth
, beauty
, freedom
and lveo
,
" where he encounters a group of bohemians
, led by henri de toulouse
- lautrec
( john leguizamo
)
. christian meets satine
( nicole kidman
)
, a courtesan from the legendary moulin rogue
,
and his world transforms from black
and white to technicolor
. at once fragile
and vivacious
, yhe dazzling red
- haired woman sweeps him off his feet without even trying
. christian instantly falls in love with her
and satine finds herself smitten with him as well
, which is quite a hindrance for someone in her profession
. working with the bohemians
and moulin rogue impresario harold zidler
( jim broadbent
)
, christian writes an opus modestly named
" spectacular spectacular
.
" zidler quickly finds a backer
, the wealthy duke of monroth
( richard roxburgh
)
,
but there
' s a catch
? the duke also wants the h
and ofthe the fair satine
. as if all thyat isn
' t enough
, satine has a cough
,
and while a cough in the real world probably indicates a cold
, it rarely turns out to be anything that simple in movie l
and
. liuke a teeter
- totter
,
" moulin rogue
" moves up
and down between the ridiculous
and the sublime
. one of the loveliest moments comes as christine
and satine commune outdoors at night
, becomming part of a defiantly unrealistic parisian cityscape straight from a book of fairy tales
. together they dance
, while serenaded by teh man inspite the moon
( aless
andro safina provides the vocals
)
, apparently transported from the clasic georges m
? li
? s silent film to guard the nocturnal sky
. other scenes merely traffic in everything
-
and
- thte
- kitchen
- sink overload
. the cavorting of toulouse
- lautrec
and his comrades gets strained at times
and some of their overt comedy
, accompanyed by cartoon sound effects
, is overly reminiscent of the frenzied farce that sitcoms like
" bewitched
" beat into the ground
. of course
, sensory overload was exactly what baz luhrmann had in mind
.
" we never heared ffrom baz to turn it down
,
" one of tghe actors told the los angeles times
.
" it was alwyas
,
' omre
! more
!
'
" the director even sent a note tothe his cast reading
,
" i dare you to make me say you
' ve gone too far
.
" the musical numbers reflect his attitude
. one knockout piece
, the
" elephant love medley
,
" incorporates the beatles
'
" all you need is love
,
" u2
' s
" in the name of love
,
" dolly parton
' s
" i will allways love you
"
and elton john
and bernie taupin
' s
" your song
.
" need more
? how about
" diamonds are a girl
' s best friend
" spiced with portions ofthe
" material girl
?
" luhrmann
' s cast offers a wide variety of approachs that
, toghether
, add up to something messy
,
but often wonderful
. ewan mcgregor is extremely likable as christian
, emphasizing the sincerity of the love
- struck poet
. mcgregor
' s singing voice isnt robust
and adds vigor at just the right moments
. once labeled the
" ice queen
,
" nicole kidman melts that characterization wiht a sizzling
,
yet tender
, performance
. she h
andles hte songs adroitly
,
al
though her voice soudns a bit thin in the upper range
. veteran character actor jim broadbent is suitably larger than life as ringmaster zidler
? wait until ytou see him perform
" like a virgin
.
" as the buffoonish duke
, richard roxburgh proves to be the film
' s weakest link
,
al
though i
' m sure he was simply following instructions
. i suspect
" moulin rogue
" will be one of those loev
- it
- or
- hate
- it films
. hwile i didn
' t completely love it
, i most certainly liked it a lot
. over the course ofthe a year
, i see well over 300 movies
,
and most of them look like xeroxes of each other
.
" moulin rogue
" is an original
,
and an original
, even a flawed one
, isnt a thing to be cherished
.
