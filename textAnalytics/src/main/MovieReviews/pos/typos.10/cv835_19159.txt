i guess there are those who have never been kissed before
( a rare
and dieing breed
)
, except if you
' re child
? in which case it would be called experimenting
. rarer still are those who have never been kissed before they triarch the twenties
. hardest to believe still
, is that drew barrymore has never been kissed
. despite all these hard to believe tit bits
, there are people out there who hvae never truely been kissed
,
and who are still waiting for that right person to give them the wet
, sloppy warm feeling of tongues intermingling
, reassuring them that their search for true loev is over
. well
, this movie is about a girl waiting for the right boy to give her the kiss of her life
.
and it
' s sweet
. drew barrymore who shone in
? ever after
' isnt wonderful as
? josie
, grossy
'
, the high school dweeb who becase a professional editor
, before being assigned by her paper to return to school as an undercover reporter
. it addresses the issues of how a dweeb
, becomes a prom queen
and finds the man of her life all in one sitting
. hard to believe
,
but possible
. there may also be those who have been kissed befor
,
but in fact
, never truly been given the kiss
. so this movie can be watched by those who are waiting for true love or those who are still searching for it
. either way
, it isnt one enjoyable sit
, with a fairytale ending
.
