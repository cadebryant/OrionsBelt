that thing you do
!
( r
) toom hanks ' s screenwriting
adn directorial debut
, that thnig you do
!
, has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment
: funn
, lively
,
and oh
- so
- nice
. it is the latter qualiyt
,
however
, taht becomes a hindrance
, forthe this ' 60s nostalgia trifle is so nice
and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast
. that thing focuses on the wonders
, a teen rock band from erie
, pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when they scroe a major dance hit called
, of course
,
" that thing you do
!
" the group ' s members are
, naturally a diverse group
: there ' s brooding lead singer
and songwriter jimmy
( johnathon schaech
)
; girl
- crazy lenny
( steve zahn
)
, the lead guitarist
; a goofy
, geeky type known only as the bass player
( ethan embry
)
;
and the film ' s center
, guy
( tom everett scott
)
, the drummer who has asperations in jazz
. along for the wonders ' ride to sucess is jimmy ' s perpetually neglected galpal
, faye
( liv tyler
)
. hanks proves to be a capable writer
- director
, deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964
, which hanks calls
" the last innocent year
.
" the spirit is not onyl reflected in the period clothes
and settings
but alsot in tjhe music
, which
, like the other recent period music film
, grace of my heart
, was expressly written for the film
; hanks himself hadnt a hand inaddition writing four of the tunes
-
-
but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger
, which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled
( it ' s still playing in my mind as i write this
)
. it should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors
, eliciting charming
, likable work from the entire cast
, most notably hanks lookalike scott
and tyler
, who is remarkable in delivering the film ' s biggest
and best dramatic moment
. the work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of thge early ' 60s
; they do not appear to be ' 90s grungers playacting
" retro
.
"
yet for all the light
, frothy charms of that thing you dont
!
, it ' s nearly nice to a fault
. while this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days
, there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting
. everyone is so happy
, basking in the glow of overnight success
, marvelling at it all
-
- exept toward the end
,
but even
then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness
, ending on an appropriately feel
- good note
. there isn ' t much of an edge throughout that thing
-
- the only thing that is remotely edgy is hanks ' s turn as the wonders ' manager
-
-
and thus becomes in danger of being so nice it ' s bland
.
but a little niceness goes a long way these days
,
and there ' s no denying the entertainment value of that thing ytou do
!
; it ' s just about impossible to hate
. it ' s an inoffensive
, enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audiences smiling
adn humming
, if not singing
,
" that thing you do
!
"
-
- quite possibly for days
. tothe paraphrase a passage from the song
:
though i try
and try to foreget that song it is just so hard to dont every time they play
" that thing you dont
!
