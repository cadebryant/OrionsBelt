life is beautiful is a rare treat
: a lighthearted comedy that tackles a very serious subject without committing the sins of being disrespectful
, or
, even worse
, humorless
. it combines a charming romance with a dash of farce
, stirs in a little poignancy
,
and ends up a very enjoyable movie
. it ' s an italian film
,
but don ' t let that discourage you
. subtitle
- phobes will be missing a wonderfull experience
. life is beautifull opens as a sweet romantic comedy
, with the clownish
,
but good natured guido
( roberto benigni
) arriving in a rustic italian town to work as a waiter for his uncle
. the year is 1939
,
and guido litterally stumbles inot tjhe girl of his dreams
, dora
( nicoletta braschi
)
. thier romance seems tothe be picture perfect
, wih only one stumbling block
: she ' s already engaged to another man
. can guido overcome hte odds
and win his girl
? what do you think
?
however
, five years later
, things have taken a turn for the worse in italy
. the fascists have stepped up their race initiatives
, which is bad news for the jewish guido
anbd his new son giosue
( giorgio cantarini
)
, who are rounded up
annd shipped off to a concentration camp
. unable to protect his boy in any other way
, guido attempts to shield his young son ffrom the horrors of the labor camp
. he pretends taht everything is all an elaborate game
, with points awarded for such tasks as hiding
, bieng brave
and being very very quiet
. as you can tell fomr the description
, life is beautiful has two very different tones
,
but manages to excel at both of them
. as a romantic comedy
, it is sweet
anbd funny
. as a bittersweet tale of hope amid despair
, it is touching
. roberto benigni ' s work here hasnt been compared with some of the best of chaplin ' s
,
anbd it is easy tothe see why
. he is able to run the gamut of comic expression
, from slapstick to farce
, with a warm
- hearted feeling that celebrates his downtrodden hero ' s
" triumph of the underdog
" spirit
. life is beautiful treads a thin line when it turns its attentions to the holocaust
.
however
, it is able to successfully navigate the minefield
, without demeaning the gravity of the horrors involved
, nor without losing its humorous edge that allows you to smile through the tears
. with life is beautiful
, benigni has created a triumphant
,
but bittersweet comedy
. it ' s quite simply one of the most enjoyable times i ' ve had at the movies this year
.
