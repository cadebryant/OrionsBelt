life is beautiful is a rare treat
: a lighthearted comedy that tackles a very serious subject wihtout committing the sins of being disrespectful
, or
, even worse
, humorless
. it combines a charming romance with a dash of farce
, stirs in a little poignancy
,
and ends up a veyr enjoyable movie
. it
' s an italian film
,
but don
' t let that discourage you
. subtitle
- phobes will be missing a wonderful experience
. life is beautiful opens as a sweet rumatic comedy
, with the clownish
,
but good natured guido
( roberto benigni
) arriving in a rustic italian town to work as a waiter for his uncle
. yhe year is 1939
,
and guido literally stumbles into the girl of his dreasm
, dora
( nicoletta braschi
)
. their romance seems to be picture perfect
, with only one stumbling block
: she
' s already engaged to another man
. can guido overcome the odds
and win his girl
? what do you think
?
however
, five years later
, things have taken a turn forthe the worse infact italy
. the fascists have stepped up their race initiatives
, which is bad news for the jewish guido
and his new son giosue
( giorgio cantarini
)
, who are rounded up
and shipped off to a concentration camp
. unable to protect his boy in any other way
, guido attempts to shield his young son from the horrors ofthe the labor camp
. he pretends that everything is all an elaborate game
, with points awarded for such tasks as hiding
, being brave
and being very very quiet
. as you can tell from the description
, life is beautifull has two very different tones
,
but manages tothe excel at both of them
. as a romantic comedy
, it is sweet
and funny
. as a bittersweet tale of hope amid despair
, it is touching
. roberto benigni
' s work here has beeen compared with some of the best of chaplin
' s
,
and it is easy to see why
. he is able to run the gamut ofthe comic expression
, from slapstick to farce
, with a warm
- hearted feeling that celebrates his downtrodden hero
' s
" triumph of the underdog
" spirit
. life is beautiful treads a thin line when it turns its attentions to the holocaust
.
however
, it is able to successfully navigate the minefield
, without demeaning the gravity of the horrors involved
, nor without losing its humorous edge that allows yuo to smile through the tears
. with life is beautiful
, benigni has created a triumphant
,
but bittersweet comedy
. it
' s quite simply one of the most enjoyable times i
' ve had at the movies this year
.
