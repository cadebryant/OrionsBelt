i feel no hesitation inwhich saying thyat
" there
' s something about mary
" is the best film that i will see all year
. from the moment the credits started to roll at the end of the picture
, there was no dout in my mind that i hadnt seen a masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of 1998
. it is that ogod of a film
. when ginee siskel said this about
" fargo
" onyl a few months into
' 96
, i dismissed the notion as ridiculous
. how could yuo possibly know that a film is so great that nothing you coudl possibly see in the future could beated it
?
but after seeing the farrelly
' s hilarious
and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork
, i now know what siskel was talking baout
. once in a
( very great
) while
, a film comes along that is so daring
, so brilliant adn simply so enjoyable that at the end
, you just want to st
and up
and cheer
.
and you know
, at thast instant
, that ytou have just experienced something very special
. now for the shocker
;
" mary
" is the grossest
and most disgusting film i have ever viewed
(
" pink flamingos
" obviously notwithst
anding
)
. the movie is so rude
and
, i guess
, inappropriate in nature that i had a hard time sitting in a theater watching it with my parents
( luckily i had seen it before them
, so i could warn the about what htey were infront for
)
. forget
" blazing saddles
"
,
" animal house
"
and even tje former king of gross
- out comedy
,
" monty python
' s meaning of life
"
; they were all only preludes to the farrelly
' s assault on the senses
. in fatc
, this may even be the funniest film i
' ve ever had the blessure of seeing
( the only real contender is
" monty python
and the holy grail
"
)
,
and most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade
.
but as funny as it is
, something also has to be said about the overall sweetness of
" mary
"
; it has a huge heart
. ytou see
, the farrelly
' s are truly gifted filmmakers
. they don
' t just present you with a string of dick
and fart jokes
(
al
though there are plenty to go around
)
. they also
, very wisely
, add an unbeleivable amount of charisma to the main characters
and actualy have them develop as the story progresses
. it
' s funny
,
though
. if you just look at an outline of the story
, it seems kind of contrived anbd predictable
.
but elieve me
, it is anything
but
. ben stiller plays ted
, a very shy
and clumsy teenage geek who lusts aftter the school babe
, mary
( cameron diaz
)
. after he sticks up for her retarded brother
, warren
( w
. eearly brown
- the cameraman
, believe it or not
, from
" scream
"
)
, his dreasm come true when she invites him to the prom
. inaddition one of the film
' s funniest scenes
, something goes wrong
( i won
' t ruin it for those who know nothing about the film
)
and ted is unable to face mary ever agian
. jump to the present
. aftter years of self
- loathing
, ted finally hires private detective pat healy
( a suitably slimy matt dillon
) to track her down so he can have one lastr chance at winning the woman he has loved since high school
. healy finds that mary is still a full
- blown hottie
and decides to try
and keep her for himself
. admittingly
, the basic story line leaves a little to be desired
. after all
, with a not
- really
- all
- that
- funny premise
, how can you sustain laughter for nearly two hours
? somehow
, the farrelly
' s pull it off
. the performances here are also right on target
. as ted
, stiller adds just tyhe right amount of clumsy charm to make his chracter nto irritating
, as he would normally be
,
but very lovable
.
and cameron diaz is perfect in her role for obvious reasons
,
but the acotr who really grabs your attention is w
. earl brown as mary
' s brother
. no other actor hasnt even come close to playing a menally retarded man with as much natural ease as brown displays here
. i know he won
' t be nominated
, bu this is the guy who should not be counted out when it comes time to h
and out the oscar nods in february
. as good as the actors are
,
though
, it
' s the directors
' movie all the way
. i guarantee thgat on almost eveyr other top ten list at the end of the year
, you will see the number one space occupied by steven spielberg
' s wwii epic
" saving private ryan
"
.
and yes
, that is a great film worthy of the recognition it has been getting
. bu which is harder
; making a great war film or having your audience laugh so hard that tehy can
' t breath for minutes at a time
? i
' ll let you decide that one for yourself
,
but this critic is sticking to his guns
. there is just something baout
" mary
"
.
