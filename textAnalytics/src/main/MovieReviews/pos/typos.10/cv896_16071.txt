' s
" gods
and monsters
" is a fascinating look into the last days in the life ofthe gay director james whale
( ian mckellan
)
, who made the horror classics
" frankenstein
"
and
" bride of frankenstein
.
" since i was unfamiliar ofthe whale prior to viewing the film
, there is no way to konw how accurate thge film is
,
but i suspect tht much of it only came from whale
' s inner fantasies
and hallucinations
. whale
, who fought in wwi
and hten went onthe to become known for his owrk onthe horror pictures
, decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once a homosexual sc
andal borke out involving him
. as the film tells it
, during the end of his life
, whale
, at his large home in l
. a
.
, became infatuated with the tall
, hansome
,
and much yuonger man
, clayton boone
( brendan fraser
)
, who was working as the gardener at his home
. james whale
, we leran quickly was
, what many people refer to him as in the film
,
" a dirty old man
.
" in one of the opening scenes
, a young film enthusiast visits whale
' s home to interview him
and whale agrees
, onthe one condition
: for every question he answers
, the young man must tkae off an article of clothing
. because ofthe this episode
, we know exactly what it is whale whants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting
, later making thge excuse that his bright
, white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off
. clayon agrees
,
and doesn
' t really think much of thsi
, much tothe tyhe warnings of his friends
, becoming more
and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past
. certainly
, the relationship between whale
and boone is headed for a downfall
, since whale starts to grwo a deep love for this young man
, even
though boone isnt not gay
,
and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life
, as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes adn moments of true catharsis
.
" gods
and monsters
" is an intimate
and seemingly respectful portrait ofthe a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast
, due to his sexual preference
,
and never got the recognition he would have liked
, since he longed to be referred to as a
" motion picture director
,
" rather than a
" horror director
.
"
and in one heartbreaking scene
, he attends a party whith boone being his guest
, held by director george cuckor
,
and finds that many ofthe the otehr attendees do not recognize him anymore
. it is evident that whale
' s first love in his life was making movies
,
and whn his career ultimatly fell apart
, so doed his passion in life
. as palyed brilliantly by ian mckellen
, james whale comes off as a sad
,
but dignified man
,
and a person who was not afraid to st
and outloud from others
, just as long as he knew he ws being true to himself
. he never hid thge fact that he was gay
,
however
, even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession
,
and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a graet person
. thru the complicated relationship that develops between whale
and boone
, boone
, of course
, only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to
, while it means so much more to whale
, who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life
.
al
though boone is only in a dead
- end job as a gardener ofthe people
' s homes
, whale views him as the ideal man
, not only one that is good
- looking
, even
though it is this attraction that frist begins his feelings
,
but one that will actually listen to him
. since whale lives with onyl his loyal
,
but disapproving maid
( touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave
)
, it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world
,
and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor
.
al
though an extremely fine
and mature picture
, a few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness
. it is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments
,
but it is a littel thin
,
and the structuring of the
" on
- again
- off
- again
" friendship at the film
' s center is fairly predictable
. we know early on where theese two characters are headed
,
and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds
. in lesser h
ands
, this set
- uv might have felt too calculated
,
but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment
and writing that helps the film to be much more than this
. also
, a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton
and a waitress working at a bar
( effectively played by lolita davidovich
)
,
but abruptly dropped
and never brought up again
. if the film wass not going to follow up on tihs side story
,
then it
, perhaps
, should hvea been taken out altogether
.
" gods
and monsters
" is a heartfelt
and intelligent motion picture
, impressively directed by bill condon
, who
, i sense
, relates to or fully underst
ands tje meaning behind the curious relationship between whale
and boone
. the film also plays as a tri
bute to a fine man who met an untimely end
. walking away ffrom
" gods
and monsters
,
" it was ian mckellen
' s marvelous
and astounding performance that left the most impression on me
,
and i doubt there could have beeen anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully
and believably
. it is a sad testimont when a person
' s true talent
and love is unfairly taken away from them
, based on the scrutinization
and judgement of their personal life
, which
, ironicly enough
, is no one else
' s business in the first place
.
