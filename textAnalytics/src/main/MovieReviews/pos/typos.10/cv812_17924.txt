: very good seats
, sound
and picture
] do you realize that every time you encounter a new person you ' ve just become part of a story
? everyone has their own life story
, both past
and present
,
adn every time two or more interact
, they become part of each others ' story
( not necessarily an important or even significant part
,
but a part nevertheless
)
. that seems tothe be the basic theory behind
` go
, ' where several characters ' chance encounters all effect each otehr inaddition extreme ways
. in order to test this theory screenwriter john august
and directer doug liman assemple a cast of characters that wouldn ' t usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them
, such as a teenage supermarket cashier
, a bottom
- of
- the
- drug
- food
- chain dealer
and two struggling soap opera actors
. these types of characters might not sound all that original
,
but consdider that htey wiull all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer
and his psychotic father
, a mid
- level drug dealer
, a narc obsessed with multi
- level
- marketing
, horny wedding guests
, a zen lovemaker
, two shrimp
- scarfers
and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out
. how they will all come together is the proces the film deals with
. i ' d imagine tghe concept to thge film started out as the creators ' testing themselves to see if tehy could actually pul it off
and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking
and the craft of fiction in general
. the film starts out as anything else
, with little indication of what ' s to come
. we meet ronna
( polley
)
, a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn ' t seem to have much desire to do anything exept wokr just to pay her rent
. she ' s not very charming
, especially to her customers
,
but this is played mostly for laughs rether thna characterization
and it works
. maybe this is because she ' s not a very afeminite character
,
but she ' s far from masculine
- a creative character indeed
. things start tothe progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours ofthe the goofy
, hyperactive
,
yet likable simon
( askew
)
, an english teen into vices fo teh sake of the experiences
. this agreeement starts a three
- pronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends
and in turn drags ronna
and her friends into buying
and selling an experimental drug
. the process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested
but also to death
. nearly the same can be said for two otehr characters
, zack
( mohr
)
and adam
( wolf
)
, who we don ' t think much of when they first appear as supporting characters
,
but later iwll become major players to the film ' s makeup
- another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be
. once the pace is picked up thte film really begins to show its mettle
. when the title screen
` ronna ' is flashed shortly after tghe aforementioned turning point scene
, it ' s clear this film isn ' t going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling
. considering how ogod it is up until that point
, it ' s a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today
.
and so the film begins to take shape
, first by following ronna
and her friends on a one
- night adventure that begins with a drug deel instigated by zack
and adam
( who were actually looking for simon
)
, which doesn ' t exactly go as planned
,
but that ' s what keeps it all so intresting
. the second storyline starts at the same moment as ronna ' s story
,
but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead
. simon
and his three friends head to
? vegas for a night on the twon
annd in the process experience things they never would hvae imagined
. yhe third arc
, about zack
and adam
, again overlaps with ronna ' s story telling much of the same story
but from a completely diferrent angle
. we ' re shown thigns we never would have expected were going on while follwoing ronna
.
and many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack
anbd adam aren ' t even their fault
- they just happened to be where they were when they were
. i ' d really like to dissect each of the three storylines
anbd especially how the film wraps up in the end
,
but that would tkae up too much time
and space
anbd spoil everything for those who haven ' t seen the film
. perhaps the greatest element tothe the film is its constant surprises
and unpredictability
,
and not due tothe plot twists or a confusing screenplay
, jsut thru great filmmaking
. still
, i cin list
and analyz nearly everything the film does so well
:
? direction
: trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task
and for a rookie filmmaker such as liman
, it ' s a graet accomplishment
. he doesn ' t jsut depict a story
, he wraps us up in it all
, pulling us inot the fray so that we experience every high
and low
.
? screenplay
: besides being chiseled with detail
and creative in general
, it ' s clear the script has beeen inspired by many sources
, with both obvious
and subtle references
,
yet it never screams
` rip
- off
. '
? tone
/ mood
: where other hollywood films have failed to bring the charm of the independents to the mainstream
, this one is able to create its pwn sense of the macabre
. it ' s nto overly
- dark or twisted
and tghe comedy isn ' t so satirical for it tothe be considered a black comedy
, more like
` macabre light
. '
? cinematography
/ art direction
: able to photograph both the intense
and the lighthearted in the same manner
.
? characterization
: for nearly every character introduced
, no matter what role htey play in the big picture
, we ' re able tothe get a sense of who they are
, what htey ' re thinking
and how they came to be iin their situations
. even when their actions are surprising
, it never seems very out of synch
.
? performances
: every actor nails their role
( see above
)
.
? theme
/ theory
: the film doesn ' t seem to be conserned with conveying any kind of political or social messages
, instade
, it ' s more of a philosophical experiment
. in fact
, it might nto have meant to do that intentionally
,
but there definitely is something existential to it all
.
.
.
.
and to think that
` go ' is just a big comedy
and adventure
