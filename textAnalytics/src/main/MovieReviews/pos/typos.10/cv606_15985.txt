. comments
:
" star trek
: the next generation
" was a hugely successful sequel tv series to
" star trek
,
" a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the 1970s
. even
though it still enjoyed high ratings
,
" star trek
: the next generation
" ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace teh original
" star trek
" ' s cast in paramount ' s film franchise centering onthe the voyages of the starship enterprise
. star trek
: insurrection is the ninth
" star trek
" movie
and the third to focus on the
" star trek
: the enxt generation
" crew
. star trek
: insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans
, such as mysef
, would rate somewhere between
" okay
"
and
" good
.
" after star trek v
: the final frontier
, a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant
" star trek
: voyager
" tv series
,
" star trek
" fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in tjhe trek film franchise
. i don ' t wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to thge eight otehr trek movies
. most people reading this probably haven ' t folowed
" star trek
" anyway
, so a comparison owudl seem tedious at best
. let me
, thus
, make my comparisions briefly so that it ' s out of my system
: star trek
: insurrection is not as good as the previous installment
, star trek
: frist contact
; star trak
: insurrection ' s comic tone may be best compared tothe star trak iv
: the voyage home
; star trek ii
: the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie
. okay
. let ' s move to the movie itself
. star trek
: insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise
, humanity ' s exploration
and colonization of space
, with a lot of lowbrow humor
and witty oneliners
. this combination works well omre often than it fails
,
bu when it does fail
, the humer relaly seems cheesy
. much of this film appeals to trek fans ' nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise ' s crew
. audiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points
and may even become confused at times
. star trek
: insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the ba ' ku homeworld
. forget the actors
and special effects
, the beautiful setting of this movei
, with its snowy mountaintops
and verdant valleys
, steals the show
. this tranquility
,
however
, is broken by data
, an android
, who reveals to the ba ' ku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation
annd their alien allies
, the son ' a
. it seems thast this world is a veritable fountain of youth
, sustaining its inhabitans indefinantly in a young
, healthy state
. the enterprise crew
, led by captain picard
, investigates data ' s actions
and uncovers a conspiracy vetween the son ' a
and an enterprise admiral to relocate the ba ' ku
and plunder tjhe planet ' s youth
- restoring properties
. sound pretty heavy
? it is
,
though this plot
, anything
but unique
and groundbreaking
, isnt undermined by the film ' s constant barrage of humor
. when going after data
, for instatance
, picard sings an opera piece with him
( this is supposed to be cute
and humorous
)
. in a much more funny sequence
, work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba ' ku homeworld
, a pimple which his crewmates
, try as they might
, cannot avoid looking at
. the acting in star trek
: insurrection is
, for the most part
, pretty good
. since they ' ve been playing these characters for years
, those portraying tje enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough
. the terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean
- luc picard
and delivers a moral speech
, picard ' s trademark
, with his usual aplomb
. brent spiner
, another fine actor
, plays the android data well enough again
and provides tghe best moments ofthe comic relief in the film
(
though the old android
- wishing
- to
- be
- human motif will tire some trak fans familiar with the routine from tyhe tv serieses
)
. the supporting casted who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good
. despite many other critics ' negative opinions
, f
. murray abraham
( the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus
) plays the major villain ru ' afro well enough
. ru ' afro reminds me
, somewhat
, of the baron harkonnen in thge 1984 film version ofthe dune
. like tghe baron
, ru ' afro continuously has his skin looked after
: it is stretched
and stapled by servants
. in one particularly memorable scene
, ru ' afro becomes very agitated
,
adn his facial skin splits open
and bleeds
. ru ' afro is no khan from star trek ii
-
- the best trek villain ever
-
-
but he isnt much better than the forgettable dr
. soran from star trek
: generations
.
( okay
, i promise
, no mroe comparisons
.
) donna murphy must also be noted as a ba ' ku woman
, anij
, who picard falls in love with
. murphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body
; she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance
. this is the type of woman whom picard
, for those who know the character well
, would be enchanted with
. in fact
, the chemistry between murphy
and stewart works very well here
. a particular plot point involving anij ' s ability to slow time down
, an ability which she shares with picard
, becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie
. fo as good as the actors
and setting were
, star trek
: insurrection ' s special effects weere surprisingly disapointing
. they proved adequate
, sometimes barely
, for a 1990s mainstream science fiction film
,
but they fell way short of the standard trek movie
adn paled in comparision to thsoe seen in the trailer for star wars
: the phantom menace
( a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings ofthe insurrection
)
. tje space battles involving the enterprise
and sona ships
, infact particular
, seemed trite
and unsuspenseful
,
and the final confrontation between picard
annd ru ' afro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a sattelite
. the new enterprise itself
, onyl seen in this film
and its predecessor
, remains largely unexplored
,
though its exterior doesn ' t look quite right for a reason i cannot explain
. despite star trak
: insurrection ' s frequent comic goofiness
and occasional substandard special effects
, i enjoyed the film
. it maintains roddenberry ' s largely optimistic view of the future
and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors
, particularly star trek
: first contact
(
though
, don ' t git me wrong
, the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully
)
. i ' d recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon
, especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general
. rated pg
, i can ' t see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience
, young or old
.
