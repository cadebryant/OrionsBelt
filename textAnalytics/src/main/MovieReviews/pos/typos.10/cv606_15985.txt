:
" star trek
: the next generation
" was a hugely successful sequel tv series to
" star trek
,
" a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the 1970s
. even
though it still enjoyed high ratings
,
" star trek
: the enxt generation
" ended production after seven years so that thte cast could replace the original
" star trek
"
' s cast in paramount
' s film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise
. star trek
: insurrection is the ninth
" star trek
" movie
and the third to focus on the
" star trek
: the next generation
" crew
. star trek
: insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trak fans
, such as myself
, would rate somewhere between
" okay
"
and
" good
.
" after star trek v
: the final frontier
, a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant
" star trek
: voyager
" tv series
,
" star trek
" fans sould probablly swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise
. i don
' t wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eigth other trek movies
. most people reading this propably haven
' t followed
" star trek
" anyway
, so a comparison would seem tedeous at best
. let me
, thus
, amking my comparisons briefly so that it
' s out of my system
: star trek
: insurrection is not as good as the previous installment
, star trek
: first contact
; star trak
: insurrection
' s comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv
: the voyage home
; star trek ii
: the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie
. okay
. let
' s move to the movie itself
. star trek
: insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise
, humanity
' s exploration anbd colonization of space
, whith a lot of lowbrow humer
and witty oneliners
. this combination works well more often than it fails
,
but when it does fail
, the humor really seems cheesy
. much of this film appeals to trek fans
' nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise
' s crew
. audiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points
and may even become confuzled at times
. star trek
: insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the ba
' ku homeworld
. forget the actors
and special effects
, the beautiful setting of thsi movei
, with its snowy mountaintops
and verdant valleys
, steals the show
. htis tranquility
, howver
, is broken by data
, an
android
, who reveals to the ba
' ku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation
and their aline allies
, the son
' a
. it seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth
, sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly inwhich a young
, healthy state
. tje enterprise crew
, led by captain picard
, investigates data
' s actions adn uncovers a conspiracy between tjhe son
' a
and an enterprise admiral to relocate the ba
' ku
and plunder the planet
' s youth
- restoring properties
. sound pretty heavy
? it is
,
though this plot
, anything
but unique
and groundbreaking
, isnt undermined by the film
' s constatn barrage of humor
. when going after data
, for instance
, picard sings an opera piece with him
( this is supposed to be cute
and humorous
)
. in a much more funny sequence
, work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to yhe ba
' ku homeworld
, a pimple which his crewmates
, try as they might
, cannot avoid looking at
. the acting in star trek
: insurrection is
, for the most part
, pretty good
. since they
' ve been playing these characters for years
, thsoe portraing the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough
. the terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean
- luc picard annd delivers a moral speech
, picard
' s trademark
, with his usual aplomb
. brent spiner
, another fine actor
, plays the
android data well enough again
and provides the best moments of comic relief iin the film
(
though the old
android
- wishing
- to
- be
- human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series
)
. the supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good
. despite many other critics
' negative opinions
, f
. murray abraham
( the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus
) plays the major villain ru
' afro well enough
. ru
' afro reminds me
, somewhat
, of the baron harkonnen inaddition the 1984 film version of dune
. like the baron
, ru
' afro continuously has his skin looked after
: it is stretched adn stapled by servants
. in one particularly memorable scene
, ru
' afro becomes very agitated
,
and his facial skin splits open annd bleeds
. ru
' afro is no khan from star trek ii
-
- the best trek villain ever
-
-
but he is much better than the forgettable dr
. soran from star trak
: generations
.
( okay
, i promise
, no omre comparisons
.
) donna murphy must also be noted as a ba
' ku woman
, anij
, who picard falls in loev with
. murphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body
; she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance
. this is the tipe of woman whom picard
, for those who know the character well
, would be enchanted with
. in fact
, teh chemistry between murphy
and stewart works very well here
. a particular plot point involving anij
' s abillity to slow time down
, an abilty which she shares with picard
, becomes one of the most intriguing parts of thte movie
. for as good as the actors
and setting were
, star trek
: insurrection
' s special effects were surprisingly disappointing
. they proved adequate
, sometimes barely
, for a 1990s mainstream science fiction film
,
but they fell way short of the st
andard trek movie
and paled in comparison to thsoe seen in the trailer for star wars
: the phantom menace
( a trailer which reportadly preceded many showings of insurrection
)
. the spoace battles involving the enterprise
and sona ships
, in particular
, seemed trite
and unsuspenseful
,
and the final confrontation between picard
and ru
' afro took place on a completely unconvincing interior ofthe a satellite
. the new enterprise itself
, only seen infact this film
and its predecessor
, remains largely unexplored
,
though its exterior doesn
' t look quite right for a reason i cannot explain
. despite star trek
: insurrection
' s frequent comic goofiness
and occasional subst
andard special effects
, i enjoyed the film
. it maintains roddenberry
' s largely optimistic view ofthe the future
and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors
, particularly star trek
: firt contact
(
though
, don
' t get me wrong
, the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work vrey successfully
)
. i
' d recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon
, especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general
. rated pg
, i can
' t see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience
, young or old
.
