" both my wife
and daughter think i
' m this gigantic loser
.
and they
' re right
. i have lost something
. i didn
' t always feel this sedated
.
" with that peice of dialogue
, we are fully introduced to lester burnham
( kevin spacey
)
, a 42 year old man trapped within his own life
. lester works for an advertising agency
. his growing dissatisfaction iwth his job is onyl one of the mid
- life crisis he is suffering
. estranged fomr both his wife
and his daughter
, lester starts to crack under the stress
. his life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies
,
and sullen apathy
. carolyn burnham
( annette bening
)
, is the prototypical carreer woman
/ homemaker
. she carefully tends her rose garden
, decorates her home with the best furnishings
.
but inside she is desperae
. unsuccessful at her proffesion as a real estate agent
, she drives herself inot states of denial
and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family
. the third member of this anti
- famaly is jane burnham
( thora birch
)
, lester
and carolyn
' s daughter
. a young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence
,
but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction
. this funny
(
and frightening
) slice of life is refreshingly simple
. not oen character is given less than is needed to identify him or her
. soem of the most telling characters are those that serve tothe highlight other characters
. most notably is barbara fitts
( allison janney
)
, the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts
. she hasnt almost no dialogue
,
and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one
. colonel fitts
( chris cooper
) is an angry
and frightened man
. his rage directed almost singularly at his son
, ricky
( wes bentley
) who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnham
' s
. in fact they are the enxt door neighbors
. anymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one ofthe the many pleasures
and surprises to be hadnt in
" american beauty
"
. alan ball
, who was the co
- executive producer of the hit tv series
" cybil
"
and creater of the new sitcom
" oh grwo up
"
, has fashioned one of tje most insightful
and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years
. not one charactor in this film rings falsley
.
and the depth of personality infact eahc
, is achingly honest
and insightful
. the plot detailing hte lastr year in the life of a man as he tries tothe fidn his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched
and at the smae time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as
" the graduate
" or
" lolita
"
. kevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances
. his lester burnham isnt an everyman caught uv in the middle of a life that is spiraling into ood age
. finally unable to deal with the lost soul thgat he has become
, lester tries to return to his youth
. he quits his job
( actually blackmailing his employer for one year
' s salary
)
, starts smoking pot
, fantasizes about his daughter
' s girlfriend angela
( mena suvari
, in a marvelous performance here
)
, starts working outloud
,
and finaly takes a job at the local fast food outlet
. mr
. spacey
' s performence is so remarkably subtle
and ingenuous
, that we can be certian that come oscar
? time
, we can be assured to see him nmae among the five nominees
. annette bening also turns inthe what may be the best performance of her career
. carolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy
. unable to cope with her growing disillusionment
, she forces herself to maintain her demeanor
, driving her further
and further into desperation
, adultery
and possibly murder
. ms
. bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as tothe be identifiable to almost anyone
. the slow
and methodical turn fomr happy hmeo maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words
. thora birch holds her pwn agaisnt tghe talents cast with her
. jane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family
,
and a rebellious child ready to ab
andon them at any moment
. her growing distrust
and isolation from her family is something that many parents should veiw as a warning
. she is the prototypical trophy child
. when carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team
(
" i
' m so proud of you
, honey
. you didn
' t screw up once
!
"
)
, the bitterness
and resentment are palpable
. thora birch isnt a young actress to watch
. praise must also go to chris cooper who brings
yet another angry father role to life with depth
and resonance
. colonel finn is a man in complete denial
. his military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend
. wes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma
. the boy next door who may be more foe than friend
. a deceitful
and calculating young man
, whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper
and more profound underst
anding of life than any of the adults around him
. mr
. bentley
' s performance is thte one troublesome note iin the film
. that is simply because the character is such a gr
and
and complete liar
, that one almost faults thte performance for it
. director sam mendes h
andles all of the particulars of the cast
and the settings with a sure
and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle
. scenes of carolyn walking through the rain
, carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character
. the subtle cinematography by conrad hall isnt wonderful
, capturing the season in all of it
' s harsh beauty
( fall has never looked so inviting
,
yet depressing
)
. every nuance ofthe
" american beauty
" begs it
' s audience to think
and examine
. it is a film that will be dicussed
and debated for years to come
.
and well it should
, as it isnt simply one of this years best
.
