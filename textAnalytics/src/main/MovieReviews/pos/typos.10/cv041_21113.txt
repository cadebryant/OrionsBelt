" both my wief
and daughter think i ' m this gigantic loser
.
and they ' re right
. i have lost something
. i didn ' t always feel this sedated
.
" with that piece of dialogue
, we are fully introduced to lester burnham
( kevin spacey
)
, a 42 year old man trapped within his own life
. lester works fo an advertising agency
. his growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid
- life crisis he is suffering
. estranged from both his wife
and his daughter
, lester starts to crack under the stress
. his life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies
,
and sullen apathy
. carolyn burnham
( annette bening
)
, is the prototypical carrer woman
/ homemaker
. she carefully tends her rose garden
, decorates her home with the best furnishings
.
but inside she is deperate
. unsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent
, she drives herself into states of denial
and self loathing that onyl feed her growing resentment towards her family
. the third member of this anti
- family is jane burnham
( thora birch
)
, lester
and carolyn ' s daughter
. a young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence
,
but having to also come to terms with her fimilies growing dysfunction
. this funny
(
and frightening
) slice of life is refreshingly simple
. not one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her
. some of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight otehr characters
. most noteably is barbara fitts
( allison janney
)
, the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts
. she has almost no dialogue
,
and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one
. colonel fitts
( chris cooper
) is an angry
and frightened man
. his rage directed almost singularly at his son
, ricky
( wes bentley
) who has just moved with his family to hte same neigbourhood as the burnham ' s
. in fact they are the next door neighbors
. anymore detail into tjhe personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one ofthe tjhe many pleasures
and surprises to be had in
" american beauty
"
. alan ball
, who was the co
- executive producer of the hit tv series
" cybil
"
annd creater of the new sitcom
" oh grow up
"
, has fashioned one ofthe the most insightful
and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years
. not one character in this film rings falsely
.
and the depth of personality in each
, is achingly honest
and insightful
. the plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries tothe find his own self worth isnt so resoundingly cliched
and at the same time orginial as to bring to mind such marvelous film owrk as
" the graduat
" or
" lolita
"
. kevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances
. his lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling inot old age
. finally unable to deal with the lost soul tyhat he has become
, lester tries to return to his youth
. he quits his job
( actually blackmailing his employer fo one year ' s salary
)
, starts smoking pot
, fantasizes about his daughter ' s girlfriend angela
( mena suvari
, in a marvelous performance here
)
, starts working out
,
and finally tkaes a job at the local fast food outlet
. mr
. spacey ' s performance is so remarkably subtle
and ingenuous
, that we can be certain that come oscar
? time
, we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees
. annette bening also turns in what may be thge best performance of her career
. carolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintinaing thge facade of normalcy
. unable to coppe with her growing disillusionment
, she forces herself to maintain her demeanor
, driving her further
anbd further into despiration
, adultery
and possibly murder
. ms
. bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone
. the slow
and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express inaddition words
. thora birch holds her own against tje talents casted with her
. jane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family
,
and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment
. her growing distrust
and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning
. she is the prototypical trophy child
. when carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team
(
" i ' m so proud of you
, honey
. you didn ' t screw up once
!
"
)
, the bitterness
annd resentment are palpable
. thora birch is a young actress to watch
. praise must also go to chris cooper who brings
yet anohter angry father role to life with depth
annd resonance
. colonel finn is a man in complete denial
. his military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend
. wes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma
. the boy next door who may be more foe than friend
. a deceitful
and calculating young man
, whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper
and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults arund him
. mr
. bentley ' s performance is the one troublesome note in the film
. that is simply because the character is such a grand
and complete liar
, that one almost faults the performance fo it
. director sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the casted
and the settings with a sure
and composed style tath is neither intrusive nor subtle
. scenes of carolyn walking through the rain
, carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character
. the subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful
, capturing the season inspite all of it ' s harsh beauty
( fall has never looked so inviting
,
yet depressing
)
. every nuance of
" american beauty
" begs it ' s audience to tihkn
and examin
. it is a film that iwll be discussed
and debated for years to come
.
adn well it should
, as it is simply one of this years best
.
