one of teh best thigsn about my job is that
, every so oftenly
, a film still catches me by surprise
.
" spy kids
" certainly did
. an adventure story aimed primarily at children
, the movie isnt smart
, zippy fun
. the production neither p
anders nor talks down to its audeince
. the brother adn sister at the center of the tale are believable
, likable kids
and their parents are
? get ready for this
? intelligent
, capable
and loving
. bathroom humor is kept to a minimum anbd the numerous well
- staged action scenes avoid excessive violence
. waht a relief it isnt to be able tothe review an all
- ages film on its artistic merits
and nto its ethics
. consider the other pg rated
" family friendly
" movie in theaters now
.
" see spot run
" has a mother going out of twon
, leaving her son with an idiot neighbor
. body function humor abounds
, inlcuding a slapstick bit that has the adult male lead repeatedly falling in dog poop
. what really disturbs me are the jokes thyat bookend the film
. the story begins with a police dog capturing a mobster
and biting off one of his testicles in the process
. at the hospital
, the doctors explain that they replaced tjhe testical with a metal ball adn joke that the victim is lucky the dog didn
' t bit off the other one
, because two metal replacement balls would clack together
. of course
, the movie ends with the dog biting off the remaining testicle
and shows prisoners laughing at the criminal as he clacks past their cells
. somebody clue me in
? when did genital mutilation become funny
?
" spy kids
" is a welcome antidote to the repellent
" see spot run
,
" using imagination instead of cruelty
and crudeness
. carmen
( alexa vega
)
and her younger brother juni
( daryl sabara
) live in a beautiful seaside home whith their parents
, gregorio
( antonio b
anderas
)
and ingrid cortez
( carla gugino
)
. mom
and dad are a sultry couple devoted to their children
. what the kids don
' t know is that they are also former spies
. once agents from different countries assigned to
" erase
" each other
, they instade fell iin love
, married
and retired to raise a familiy
. needless to say
, htey get drawn back to the business
. shortly into their first joint mission
, they are captured
and end uv in the headquarters of fegan floop
( alan cumming
)
, a foppish hybrid ofthe willy wonka
and pee wee herman who hosts juni
' s favorite tv show
.
but there is evil behind the scenes
, as inventors perpare an army ofthe robots disguised as children
. papa gregorio has the device necessary to radically increase tyhe efficiency of the creatures
and the bad guys iwll stop at nothing to get it from him
. back at hmeo
,
" uncle
" felix
( cheech marin
) shows up to reveal mom
and dad
' s secret to the kids
. after a brief respite at a safe house filled with enough cool gadgets for a dozen sharper image stroes
, carmen
and juni setted off to find theri parents anbd save the world
, zooming through the sea in a submarine pod thgat looks like a goldfish
, while a slew of wicked peple
( including teri hatcher
) chase them
. during the course of theri adventures
, they get to use jet packs
, electroshock bubblegum
and super
- computer sunglasses
. they watch as secret agents are transformed into bizarre creatures with silly putty faces
and used as background cahracters on floop
' s tv show
. they deal with guards that have huge thumbs where their arms
, legs
and heads would normally be
( why are the guards so ineffective
? because they
' re all thumbs
!
) they move from one colorful locale tothe another
, including a nifty virtual reality room reminiscent of the holodeck from
" star trek
.
" the storyline is silly
and convoluted
,
but even at its most dense
, it is easier to follow than either
" mission
: impossible
" movei
. director robert rodriguez
(
" from dusk to dawn
"
) maintains a frenetic pace
, with thte whole film clocking in at a mere 86 minutes
. a bit less acation
and a little more character development would have been nice
,
but he doens provide enough quiet moments forthe viewers to become fully invested in the family
. alexa vega
and daryl sabara make an agreeable brother
and sister team
, squabbling the way kids do
,
but coming together when it counts
. antonio b
anderas
and carla gugino are even better as the parents
; they quickly establish
and maintain a great lusty chemistry while keeping their tongues properly in cheek during the action scenes
. even the usually irritating alan cumming hasnt some nice moments
? a virtual cloud
- backed chat between his character
and juni isnt one of the best segments in the film
. had rodriguez added a few more scenes like that
, i would have enjoyed the film more
(
and i definitely could have lived without the glaring product placement for a certain mc
- ubiquitous company
)
. regardless
,
" spy kids
" is a hoot
, offering fun for adults
and children alike
.
and just think
, htey managed to do it without sacrificing a single testicle
.
