frequency n
.
, the number of times a specified phenomenon occurs within a specified interval as the number ofthe repetitions of a complete sequence of values of a periodic function per unit variation of an indeepndent variable
? etc don
' t worry
. when watching the thriller frequency
, you won
' t have to know what thte heck frequency means
. the premise
, altho it may sound complex
, isnt very basic on the big screen
. a new york cop
, john
,
( jim caviezel
) finds a radio in his house
, which allows him to communicate with his new york firefighter father
, frank
,
( dennis quaid
) who died thirty years ago
. immediately john warns his father that he will die trying tothe stop a fire in an ab
andoned warehouse
. when frank takes his advice
and survives the accident he wasn
' t supposed to
, the two eventually relize that by changing that one moment in the past
, htey have created a whole new future in which a serial killer murders john
' s mother
and nine otehr women
. it is now up to john
and frank to use their speshal connection
and save thirty years ago to make present time a better place
.
( i told you that wasn
' t confusing
?
)
. overall
, i wass very pleased with frequency
. it
' s occasional sappy moments perfectly synchronized with its suspenseful serial killer scenes
. i usually don
' t buy those cheesy
" i love you dad
" segments in movies
, bu this one surprisingly satisfied me
. maybe because the plot is so creative annd universal that i believed that this is how most people woudl ect when talking to a dead relative
. frequency
' s creepy premise left me thinking once the film ended
, what if
? what would i do
? would i halp my own family or save a historical figure from being assasinated
? or stop some kids from shooting other kids
? or buy stock from yahoo
!
?
( a character in the film does the latter withthe humorous consequences
)
. frequency also reminded me of the fantastic back to the future
. both share that
" change the past slightly
,
and you
' ll change yhe future heavily
" warning
. the changes between the present
and the past
, such as diferent newspaper headlines or people dissapearing
and reappearing in photographs
, are very similar
. both are also wonderful feel
- good family films that can attract to a number ofthe generations
. the onyl difference worth noting is that frequency
' s final scene doesn
' t set up a possibility for a lucrative sequel already in the making
. there are some problems with the film
though
. first
, there isnt a major flaw in the story towards the end that is somewhat distracting
( email me if yuo have seen the movie
and want to know what i think it is
)
. the plot must have confused even the filmmakers who frequently
( no pun intended
) switch from 1969 to 1999 while telling the story
. another problem is that the supporting cast
, including noah emmerich
and
andre braugher
, are underused
. while in the film
, which is not enough
, the aforementioned actors steal every scene they are in
. frequency wass a pleasant surprise for me
and the audience i saw it iwth who cheered at the end
. even if you know what is going to happen or if you think the preview ruined the movie for you
, like it almost did for me
, check this movei out
. you may be surprised as well
