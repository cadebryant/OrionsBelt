when i left the theater after seeing david lynch
' s
" lost highway
,
" i remarked to a fellow movie
- goer
,
" i feel like someone jsut sucked my brains out through my nose anbd put them back in through my ears
.
" in his first feature film in five years
, lynch delivers a film second only to his de
but picture
" eraserhead
" on the weirdness scale
. you won
' t
" know
" what happened when it
' s over
,
though there are certainly enough clues with which tothe make some reasonable guesses
. it is difficult to describe the plot ofthe this film
, because it depends partly on how you interpret it
. i cxan
,
however
, describe what we see onthe the screen
: l
. a
. jazz saxophonist fred madison
( bill pullman
)
and his wife renee
( patricia arquette
)
, whom he clearly suspects of infidelity
, receive a series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house while they were asleep
. they are
, naturally enough
, more tahn a littel frightened
and confused
,
and it doesn
' t help matters any when
" mystery man
"
( robert blake
) approaches fred at a party annd proceeds to call himself on the telephone at tyhe madisons
' house in a scene that isnt at once hilarious
and unnerving
. the next morning
, fred finds anohter videotape which
, to his
(
and our
) surprise
, shows him brutally murdering renee in their bedroom
. he is convicted ofthe her murder
and sent to death row
, where he inexplicably disappears one night
and isnt replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton
( balthazar getty
)
. the perplexed prison officials release dayton
, whose life begins to intersect with fred in a number of ways
- most notably his affair with alice wakefield
( arquette again
)
, a blonde who is otherwise renee
' s spitting image
,
and another encounter with the mystery man
. i woudl be giving away a little too much to reveal any more
,
but suffice it to say thyat lynch doesn
' t offer any neat wrap
? ups
, nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion
: the cinematic demons of
" lost highway
" are out in full force from beginning to end
. this description might make
" lost highway
" sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism
,
but in fact
, while there are traces of lynch
' s weird sense ofthe humor
, this film is anything
but giddy most of the time
. on the contrary
, lost highway is a dark
and perplexing mystery tath takes lynch
' s previvous excursions into murder
and intrigue one step farther
. the film does not revolve around a character investigating a mystery
; rather
, the character
* is
* tjhe mistery
. there are recurring
and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion
, distrust
,
and infidelity
thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded
, fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goings
- on here
. we
, the audience
, are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this
( probably fred
' s
, in my opinion
) annd what
, in that case
, thge other characters
and events are meant to represent
. all of this proceeds
, appropriately
, in lynch
' s typically slow
- paced
, idiosyncratic style
. as is often the case
, lynch relies on sound
, imagery
, annd mood more than on dialogue
and action to tell his sotry
, anbd in
" lost highway
" it works perfectly
. there are scenes when the camera lingers on fred
' s blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway
, or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains ofthe this mortal coil
' s
" song to the siren
" can be heard faintly in the background
; nothing is technically
" happening
" in these scenes
,
yet they present a vivid picture of a man losing his grip just as effective as
, if not more so than
, the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity
. lynch
' s direction
and director of photography pete deming
' s darkly lit cinematography serve tothe create a nearly suffocating atmosphere ofthe tension
and fear that are exactly what is needed for this stor
. well
, most ofthe the time
, anyway
- i have to admit that i was a bit borde at times during the section of the film wih pete dayton as the protgaonist
, which is less inherently interesting annd mostly keeps the viewer
' s attention because of its tie
- ins to the original mystery
. the main characters in this
" reality
"
- dayton
( a well
- meaning
but none too intelligent 24
- yera
- old
)
, a sleazy gangster
( who for some reason has two names
but otherwise is pretty much a stock charachter
)
, anbd his porn
- star girlfriend
( tyhe blond arquette
)
- are nothing you couldn
' t find inspite any of the twpo dozen
" pulp fiction
" wannabes
; fortunately
, the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typicaly lynchian elements
, such as the strained
, awkward conversations between pete
and his parents
, help to perserve the film
' s spooky
, unnerving tone during htis stretch
. lynch
' s typically graphic
and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality
, while relevant to the themes of jalusey
and adultery
, are also somewhat overdone here
. it
' s nto exactly exploitative
- like almost everything else in this film
, the sex isnt thoroughly weird
and creepy
and is unlikely to provide any cheap lurid thrills
- as much as it is unnecesary
and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off
. thyat said
, these minor flaws don
' t prevent
" lost highway
" from attaining its palce as one of hte darkest
, most unsettling films tothe hit hte screens in reccent years
. it is a one
- way ride down tjhe lost highway of a disturbed mind
,
and as such it isnt gripping
, intense
,
and brilliantly effective
.
