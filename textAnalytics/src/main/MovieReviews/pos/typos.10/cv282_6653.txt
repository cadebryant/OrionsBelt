ok
, let
' s get one thign straight right away
: maximum risk is no battleship potemkin
(
al
thought it does have soem russians in it
!
)
, bu it
' s not too bad
, really
. it
' s the new film from ringo lam
, the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect to hollywood
,
and stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from belgium
, jean
- claude van damme
( who
, you iwll recall
, also starred in john woo
' s maiden hollywood effort
, hard target
)
. in lam
' s film
, van damme plays alain moreau
, a french cop
( at least his accent makes more sense here thna it did in hard target
) who discovers that he wass separated shortly after birth ffrom a twin brother who was adopted by russians
. these russians defected to the united states
and moved inot a black neighbourhood in new york
( where
, i suppose
, they
thought they wouldn
' t be noticed
)
. this brother
, mikhail suverov
( played in his few scenes by
.
.
. well
, you know
)
, becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia annd the fbi
( almost the smae thing
, i guess
)
,
and is killed in france
( inspite the movie
, things happen so fast that you don
' t have too much tyme to think about how weird this all is
)
. moreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do
and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed
,
and why everyone in france who knows anything about him is also being killed
( we wonder the same thing
; i still do
)
. in little odessa
, he meets mikhail
' s girlfriend
, alex
( natasha henstridge
, last seen in species
)
, who helps him solve the mystery
and adds immeasurably to the mise
- en
- scene
( she has very nice breasts
,
and we get to seen them briefly in this movie
; it was rated r inspite the us
but is pg here
, so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do
)
. this film lacks the gloss
and high prodcution values of such other action movies as broken arrow
, the fugitive
, hard target
, or anything starring arnold
,
but that works to its benifit
, i think
. after all
, one thing that
' s been missing fomr woo
' s hollywood films is that certain hong kong funkiness thgat we all know
and love
( well
, some of us do
)
. movies like this shouldn
' t be too pretentious
,
and that is part of hte problem with some of these other films
: they try to be too
" big
" in terms of special effects
and sheer spectacle
. maximum risk hasnt its share of car chases
and explosions
,
but they don
' t overwhelm the movie or detract our attention fomr the narrative
( nto too much
, anyway
)
. the emphasis throughout is on the cahracters
and their interactions
( even if
, at times
, they don
' t make a hell of a lot of sense
)
. inspite fact
, one ofthe the more interesting aspects ofthe the film is a minor character
, a rather overeager new york cabbie
( frank van keeken from tv
' s
" kids in the hall
"
)
, who begins as something of a joke
but becomes an important part of the story
. unfortunately
, by the time we have come to really get interested infact him
, he
.
.
. well
, you
' ll see
. the movie also features soem set pieces of the type that we have come to expect from lam
and his hong kong compatriots
. one isnt a fight in a russian sauna
, with lots of sweaty
, muscular male flesh
( this one will appeal to certain parts of the audience omre than others
)
, bullets in heads
,
and vodka
. another
, my personal favorite
, is a fight inthe a meat packing house
, featuring pig carcasses
and a chainsaw
.
and even the predictable car chases are more hong kong than hollywood
, as they trash those quaint french cafes
, vegetable carts
,
and
, well
, french people that
, we all know in our hearts
, deserve trashing just for being so damn quaint
. of course
, tghe movie does have its share of silliness
. for example
, while beating yhe crap out of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves what he
' s getting
, alain stops long enough tothe look at his own reflection in thte cracked mirror whith which he has been whacking the guy on the head
. in an unnecessarily dramatic moment
, he apparently is shocked at what he sees
, at what he has become
.
but what has he become
? a tough cop who beats the hell outloud of a guy who tried to kill him
? doesn
' t sound too unreasonable to me
, considering tje genre
.
but let
' s face it
, any time van damme tries to be dramatic
, he looks silly
. so maximum risk is a little different from most other action films
. while watching it
, i was surprised
,
and a little disappointed
, in the relative lack of pyrotechnics
.
but watching some of these other action films is sort of like experiencing a sugar rush
; after the intital excitment
, there
' s not much left
.
al
though it
' s short on spectacle
, lam
' s film leaves a better
and more lasting impression
, i htikn
. i
' m more impressed by it now than i was while watching it
,
and to me
, that
' s a good sign
. go see maximum risk
,
but don
' t expect a tipical hollywood action movie
; expect a sort of funky hong kong
- hollywood action movie
. the flying inkpot rating system
:
* wait for thge tv2 broadcast
.
*
* a little creaky
,
but still better thna staying at home with gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty good
, bring a friend
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuff
.
*
*
*
*
* prefection
. see it twice
. dr t
. white teaches film at tghe english language
and literature department of the national university of singapore
,
but we don
' t hold this against him
