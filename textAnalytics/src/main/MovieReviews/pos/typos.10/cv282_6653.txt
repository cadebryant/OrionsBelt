ok
, let ' s get one thing straight right away
: maximum risk is no battleship potemkin
(
although it does have some russians in it
!
)
,
but it ' s not too bad
, really
. it ' s the newyorker film from ringo lam
, the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect tothe hollywood
,
and stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from beligum
, jean
- claude van damme
( who
, yuo will recall
, also starred in john woo ' s maiden hollywood effort
, hard target
)
. in lam ' s film
, van damme plays alain moreau
, a french cop
( at least his accent mkaes omre sense here than it did in hard target
) who discovers that he was separated shortly after birth from a twin brother who was adopted by russians
. these russians defected to the united states
anbd moved into a black neighbourhood in new york
( where
, i suppose
, they thought they wouldn ' t be noticed
)
. htis brother
, mikhail suverov
( played in his few scenes by
.
.
. well
, you know
)
, becomes deeply involved in teh russian mafia
and the fbi
( almost the same thing
, i guess
)
,
and is killed in france
( in the movie
, thigsn happen so fast that ytou don ' t have too much time to think about how weird this all is
)
. moreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do
and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed
,
anbd why everyone inaddition france who knwos anything about him is also being killed
( we wonder the same thing
; i still dont
)
. in little odessa
, he meets mikhail ' s girlfriend
, alex
( natasha henstridge
, last seen in species
)
, who helps him solve the mystery
and adds immeasurably to the mise
- en
- scene
( she has very nice breasts
,
and we get tothe seen them briefly in this movie
; it was rated r in the us
but is pg here
, so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do
)
. this film lacks the gloss
and high production values of such other acation movies as broken arrow
, the fugitive
, hard target
, or anything starring arnold
,
but tyhat works to its benefit
, i think
. after all
, one thing that ' s been missing from woo ' s hollywood films is that certain hong kong funkiness that we all know
and love
( well
, some of us do
)
. movies like this shouldn ' t be too pretentious
,
and that is part of the problem with some ofthe these other films
: they try to be too
" big
" infront terms of special effects
and sheer spectacle
. maximum risk has its share of car chases
and explosions
,
but they don ' t overwhelm the movie or detract our attention from the narrative
( not too much
, anyway
)
. tje emphasis througout is on tghe characters
and their interactions
( even if
, at times
, they don ' t make a hell of a lot ofthe sense
)
. in fact
, one of the more intresting aspects of the film is a minor charachter
, a rather overeager new york cabbie
( frank van keeken from tv ' s
" kids in the hall
"
)
, who begins as something of a joke
but becomes an important part of the story
. unfourtunately
, by the time we have come to relaly get interested inspite him
, he
.
.
. well
, ytou ' ll see
. the movie also features some setted pieces of thte type that we have come to expect ffrom lam
and his hong kong compatriots
. one is a fight in a russian sauna
, with lots ofthe sweaty
, muscular male flesh
( this one will appeal to certain parts of the audience more than others
)
, bullets in heads
,
and vodka
. anohter
, my personal favorite
, is a fight in a meat packing house
, featuring pig carcasses
and a chainsaw
.
and even the predictable car chases are more hong kong thna hollywood
, as they trash those quaint french cafes
, vegetable carts
,
and
, well
, french peple that
, we all know in our hearts
, deserve trashing just for being so damn quaint
. of course
, the movie does have its share of silliness
. for example
, while beating the crap out of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves what he ' s getting
, alain stops long enough tothe look at his own reflection in the cracked mirror with which he has been whacking the guy on the head
. in an unnecessarily dramatic moment
, he apparently is shocked at what he sees
, at what he has become
.
but what has he become
? a tough cop who beats the hell outloud of a guy who tried to kill him
? doesn ' t sound too unreasonable to me
, considering the genre
.
but let ' s face it
, any time van damme tries to be dramatic
, he looks silly
. so maximum risk is a littel different from most other action films
. while watching it
, i wass surprised
,
and a little disappointed
, in the relative lack of pyrotechnics
.
but watching some ofthe these other action films is sort of like experiencing a sugar rush
; after the initial excitement
, there ' s nto much left
.
although it ' s short on spectacle
, lam ' s film leaves a better
and more lasting impression
, i think
. i ' m moreso impressed by it now than i was while watching it
,
and to me
, that ' s a good sign
. go see maximum risk
,
but don ' t expect a typical hollywood action movie
; expect a sort of funky hong kong
- hollywood action movie
. the flying inkpot rating system
:
* wait for the tv2 broadcast
.
*
* a little creaky
,
but still better than staying at home with gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty good
, bring a friend
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuff
.
*
*
*
*
* perfection
. see it twice
. dr t
. white teachs film at the english language
and literature department of the national university ofthe singapore
,
but we don ' t hold this against him
