of the major horror sub
- genres
, vampire movies are easily the most adaptable
. think baout it
. frankenstein movies haven
' t changed all that much because htey still need that mad
- scientist
- in
- bavarian
- castle setting
. if you made a frankenstein movie today
, you
' d have to have the monster be a virus or something
-
-
and outside ofthe michael j
. fox
, there aren
' t any actors that could play a virus convincingly
. movies about mummies would still have to be set in egypt
. there
' s not much you cant do with werewolves except take them to london or paris
, unless you want to have a teenage werewolf or something
.
(
and there
' s that michael j
. fox thing again
.
) bu you can have vampires do anything
,
and you can place them in any genre you want
, just about
. ytou can have traditional vampire movies
( bram stoker
' s dracula
) or have the anne rice version
( interview withthe the vampire
)
, or play it for laughs
( vampire in brooklyn
)
. you can put vampires in locales from sunny southern california
( the lost boys
) to squalid mexican dives
( fomr dusk till dawn
) to your local high school
( buffy
, the vampire slayer
)
. were it not redundant
, ytou could have a movie about a lew firm full ofthe vampires
. any day now
, i expect we
' ll see a movie about a vampire third baseman who has to decide whether to play a day game in order tothe break the hmeo run rocord
. or
, you can insert the vampire legend into a hong kong acation movei
-
-
and when you do that
, yuo get blade
. wesley snipes hasnt the chow yun fat role in this movie
-
- the silent
, expressionless hit man who destroys everyting in his path
. in this case
, the everything happens to be vampires taht explode into cgi shards instead of dead
, bleeding corpses
. snipes has less to sday here tahn as tjhe fugitive in u
. s
. marshals
,
but does a demonstrably better job here as a half
- vampire wreaking vengeance on the bloodsuckers
. blade is a silent
, brooding presence
, laying waste to vampires without a shred of remorse
. he is as cold as his silver
- bladed sword
, as single minded as his garlic
- filled bullets
.
yet
, he
' s not wihtout quirks
: blade drives a battered muscle car
and hasnt to glean rolex watches from his vampire victims in order to stay solvent
. like any good hong kong movei
, blade is heavy on the chopsocky action
. for some reason
, blade spends a lot more time using his kung fu artistry tahn using the traditional anti
- vampire weapons of garlic
and silver
.
( blade dismisses a man
- portable arc lamp as bieng too heavy
,
al
though it looks to be a more efficient tool to dispatch vampires
.
) unfortunately
, the guiding h
and of john woo is absent from this film
, relegating blade to the status of the replacement killers
, whic it most strongly resembles
. the replacement killers is the last movie i saw that i didn
' t review
-
- mostly because it made no impression on me
,
and i couldn
' t remember anything other than noise
, violence
,
and tyhe intensity of fat
' s performance
. blade has a little more going for it
,
and has the vampire myth to draw from
-
-
but other tahn that
, it
' s the smae kind of movie
-
- exciting
, with well choreographed action scenes
,
but with no resonance
. with a stronger villain
( stephen dorff is
( pardon the pun
) curiously bloodless as the head vampire
, leaving us to wonder what denis leary might ahev done with the role
)
, a wittier script
,
and a strong supporting cast
, blade might have been able to rise beyond the levle of commonplace summer entertainment
. as it is
, blade is an average action movie that serves to do nothing
but remind us that the summer movies just keep getting dumber
and the vampire movies just keep multiplying
.
