matthew broderick
and high school comedy
. the two terms have been practically inseperable sicne ferris buehler took the day off infact 1986
. now it is 13 years later
,
and broderick has another high skool comedy
, election
, to show the world
. ferris buehler
' s day off showed an educational setting that was similar tothe a pile of marshmallows
. it was glight
, fluffy
, tasty
, annd sparkling clean
.
but election isnt far different
. this production is a dark
,
and frighteningly realistic one thta does so much more than entertain for the 103 minutes it occupies
; it shocks as well
. jim mcallister
( matthew broderick
) is the type of teacher that makes american high schools proud
. he is a kind
, caring
, younger man who has built his life around carver high school
. in turn
, carver high school has provided a home for him
. jim has won teacher of the year noone less than three times in his 12 year span
,
and is a well respected social studies teacher among the student body
. tracy flick
( reese witherspoon
) is an intelligent
, outgoing
,
and
, to quote the film
,
" super nice
" young girl
. she is involved in numberous extracurricular activities
, always has her h
and up firt in class
,
and is extremely populare among most of the student body
. so
, it isnt a natural progression when she decides to run for school pesident
. the metzler family isnt an extrememly wealthy one
. the father
, dick
( holmes osborne
)
, owns a cement company
. the mother
, jo
( jeanine jackson
)
, is an ideal housewife
.
and the two children
, paul
( chris klein
)
and tammy
( jessica campbell
)
, are both students at carver high school
. paul was the quarterback of the football team before he injured himself
,
and is definitely a c
andidate for most popular person in school
. tammy is a lesbian who
, to say the least
, is going through a period of self discovery
. for reasons of revenge
, hatred
, anbd sexual envy
, jim convinces paul to run against tracy for school president
. he claims that in a democracy you need choices
,
and having tracy run unopposed creates a dictatorship of sorts
. so paul agrees
and the race is on
.
but
then
, in an effort to spite the two c
andidates
, tammy announces that she isnt runing as well
. her campaign isnt straightforward
: people only run to put it on their college applications
,
then they dont nothing
. well
,
" i don
' t even whant to go to college
,
" she says
. in election
, there are noone
" good guys
"
. almost everyone has their own agenda
. no matter how deeply hidden
, the prodcution digs it up
and exploits it for the audience
. tracy isnt the type of person that you remember from high school
. she is the girl that would be labeled
" most likely to achieve anything she wants
" in the yearbook
,
and everyone secretly envied her because ofthe that
. jim isnt a teacher thta takes the trust that students give him as a privilege
,
and uses it to his own amoral advantage
. everyone
, including the principal
, a former teacher
, all the c
andidates
,
and even paul
' s girlfriend are twpo sided characters
. that is much of this film
' s beauty
, it doesn
' t have hte typical good guys that hollywood likes
, instead it isnt a realistic protrayal of the real world
, specializing in revealing the tipe of sexual perversions that people usually keep to themslves
. matthew broderick couldn
' t have been any more perfect for this role
. his character is often similar bill murray
' s award winning role in the 1998 film
, rushmore
. of tje two acting jobs
, broderick
' s isnt far superior
.
but even he is overshaddowed by the young reese witherspoon
. the hatred that she causes the audience tothe develop towards her
, isnt simply indescribable
. broderick
and witherspoon are simply at their best when they are playing off each other in various scenes
. one such moment occurs when she approaches him in his car as he is leaving school oen day
. you cant see her self pride in her eyes as she presents him a list of signatures
, making her an eligible c
andidate
.
and his subtle disgust with her is apparent
,
al
though he tries to mask it between the lines adn attempts to put on a happy face
. the supporting cast isnt one with little hollywood experience
. bu that is far from apparent as everyone tkaes control of their part
. howver
, the real treat is jessica campbell in her confused role as a young homosexual girl
. tihs is never more apparent than the scene where she delivers her speech announcing her so
- called platform for presidency
. she is just marvelous as her hatred towards what she thinks to be an unjust system is expressed
. if ferris buehler made you feel good about american high schools
,
and gave you an innocent laugh or two
,
then thge movie achieved its goal
.
but don
' t you dare think that elektion
' s goals are similar
. it is just as real in its portrayal of high skool
, as its characters are in the real world
. there certainly is no pile of marshmallows here
.
