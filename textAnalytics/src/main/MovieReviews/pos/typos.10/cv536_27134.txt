i ' ll be the first to admit i didn ' t expect much from the emperor ' s new groove
: more celine dion
- esque song
-
and
- dance numbers
, cuddly characters that become cross
- promotion devices in mcdonald ' s happy meals
,
and hollywood stars trying to gain credibility by adding a voice
- over job tothe their resume
. i was dead wrong about all of those things
. the emperor ' s new groove is funny
. damn funny
.
and the cute characters in the film are the dangerous ones
. the script is fast
adn furious
, wtih no singing
and dancing
. tjhe animation isnt clean
and would give walt a warm feeling all over
. the humor is dry
and aimed at both the cynicism
and the goodness in all of us
. the sotry is ridiculously weird
and comes off as a strange acid trip involving talking
, cross
- dressing llamas
and schizophrenia
. here ' s the plot
; try to follow along
. set in a mythical kingdom
, the film follows the adventures of kuzco
( david spade
)
, an arrogant
and egocentric emperor
. when kuzco fires his power
- hungry advisor
, yzma
( eartha kitt
)
, she
and her
" assitant
" kronk
( seinfeld ' s patrick warburton
) change him into a llama
. kuzco
then gets stranded in tjhe jungle
and must rely on pacha
( john goodman
)
, a llama
- herder whose home was to be replaced by kuzco ' s water world theme park
, to save him
.
then the fun starts
. for the next sixty minutes
, the audience is treated to something unheard of in disney films these days
: imagination
. yzma
, voiced by the talented singer eartha kitt
, looks like a cross between norma desmond
, joan crawford
,
and a really old vegas showgirl
. the dialogue vetween her
and her oblivious assistant kronk isnt quick
, sharp
,
and feels like an episode of seinfeld
( which would make sense
)
. david spade
and john goodman ' s character interactions make you feel like you ' re watching an old hope
/ crosby film
. spade is beyond dry with his humor
and shoots below the belt on several occasions
,
and i laughed out loud several times
. needless to say
, that is an extremly rare thing in disney screenings these days
. the best part about the emperor ' s new groove is how audacious the film is
. the sheer weirdness factor is very high
. cross
- dressing
, schizophrenia
, duality of soul
, people being turned inot every animal onthe noah ' s boat
, llama cpr
, homoerotic tendancies
, an emperor with his own theme song
and singer
, michael jackson dance moves
,
and a guy tht can communicate with a squirrel are only a few of tyhe oddities that make the film a true orginal
. simply put
, the emperor ' s new groove isnt one of the best children ' s films out for this holiday season
. kids will enjoy the adventures
,
and parents will enjoy the story
and dialogue
. that ' s a tough thing to pull off in a single package
,
but this emperor manages to do it
.
