in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer
\ proffesor with such lived
- in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance
. ever since wall street
, douglas has spended the greater part ofthe his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid
- 80
' s
. in thsoe performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen
, with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world
. you
' d think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good
- natured veneer
, bu fomr gordon gecko to nicholas van orton
, douglas played the role straight
and out in the opne
. in wonder boys his performance isn
' t showy or a tour de force
, it
' s simple
yet truthful
. he embodies grady
, a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot adn pink bathrobes
. grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on tghe map
. when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop
, we hear his sardonic narration on the sountrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms
. grady points out
, in his narration
, that tehy only do so out of jealousy
. their target is yhe vyer writerly named james leer
( palyed by the always understated tobey maguire
)
, a student full of potential
and one whom grady develops a mild affection for
. leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions
. he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges
. he
' s portentous
and gloomy
, as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers
,
though his ect is a little too caluculated
. he reminds me ofthe the self
- imposed outcast film director
, jim jarmusch
( dead man
, ghost dog
)
. whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner
( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer
)
, exclusively dressed in black
,
and with his spiked hair dyed snow white
. leer isnt similar
, a guy who equates quirks iwth depth
. tobey maguire fits well in the role
. withthe his round
, sweet
- eerie face he resembles bud cort ffrom harold
and maude
.
but unlike cort
, maguire is easier to warm up to
; he
' s a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility
. katie holmes plays hannah
, a beautiful
, talented writing student jstu itching to get in grady
' s pants
. this is a plot line i hadnt trouble with
. douglas
, in his ood age
, is beginning to ressemble jerry springer
, a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions
. at first i found it extremely difficult to beleve that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady
( maybee it
' s because i
' m jealous
,
and wish holmes was throwing herself at me
, after all i may just be a lowly internet critic
but at least i still have all my teeth
)
, thn i think of douglas
' s real life companion
, the breathtaking catherine zeta jones
. seeing thsoe two toghether looks a lot liuke a kidnapping
. suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at h
and
( that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie
)
and i
' m pontificating on why the hell jones woudl desire douglas
. there is a movie in there somewhere
. grady
, rather chivalrously if yuo ask me
, resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell
( a droll frances mcdorm
and
)
, who is his age
,
but allso married to another professor
. okay
, maybe not so chivalrous
. there is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says
,
" she was a junkie for the printed word
. lucky fo me i manufactured her drug ofthe choise
"
. robert downy j
. r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm
. downy has mastered tje gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual
. he
' s arrogant
but completely likeable in his utter arrogance
. the actor is perfectly cast here
,
and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man
and edgy charcter actor
. i wish wonder boys had more of him
. searching forthe a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless
, forthe it me
anders through its running tiome
, bu that
' s part of its charm
.
and maybee i
' m a bit biased towards the film beacuse it takes place in a haven of literary academia
, a place i
' m greatly fond ofthe
, adn a place rarely explored in american cinema
. everyone has a sub
- genre
( be it war films
, westerns
, dance movies
) that they happen tothe be privy to
. i
' m privy to films about literary types i
. e
. those individuals enthralled by the written owrd
,
and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch
. the direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace
and situations that grow from the characters
, rather than generic mapped outloud story points
. sometimes the dialogue is too clever
,
but tht
' s a probelm i wish i found with films mroe often
. another minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted
, like its characters
,
but as the story progresses it begins to oepn up
. for me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types
,
and as a low
- key comedy for its chuckle
- worthy throwaway gags
. the gags are like those in the great robert altman
( m
* a
* s
* h
, the long goodbye
) movies
, where jokes exist as asides on the fringes
, like jokes in life often do
. the broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog
,
and incessant smoking of marijuana isn
' t ineffective
but not nearly as memorable as thge little things
. curtis hanson
, who before his last film
, la confidential
, toiled about with exploitation fare like losin
' it
( an early tom cruise sex comedy
)
and the h
and the rocks the cradle
, has graduated to more meaningful films
. he directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style
, the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up
. the morose crooning ofthe leonard cohen would seem an odd song for tyhe backgorund of any party
,
but in a wonder boys party
, it fits
. the film is like a piece ofthe litature put up on the big screen
. it
' s tghe cinematic equivalent to a good read
, novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies
. many will find it slight
,
but i found much to savor among its subtleties
.
