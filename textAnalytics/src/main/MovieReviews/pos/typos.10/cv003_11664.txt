" jaws
" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen
. the movie opens with blackness
,
and only distant
, alien
- like underwater sounds
.
then it comes
, the first ominous bars of composer john williams ' now infamous score
. dah
- dum
. from there
, director steven spielberg wastes no tiem
, taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly
. right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean
,
adn once
" jaws
" has attacked
, it never relinquishes its grip
. perhaps what is most outstanding about
" jaws
" is how spielberg builds the movie
. he works it like a theatrical prodcution
, with a first act
and a second act
. unlike so many modern filmmakers
, he has a great deal of restraint
,
and refuses to show us the shark untli hte middle ofthe the second act
. until
thne
, he merely suggests its presence witht creepy
, subjective underwater shots
and williams ' music
. he ' s building thte tension bit by bited
, so when it comes time for the climax
, the shark ' s arrival is truly terrifying
. he doesn ' t let us get bored with the imagery
. the first act opens with police chief martin brody
( roy scheider
)
, a new york cop who hasnt taken an easy
, peaceful job running the polical station on amity island
, a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn ' t been a murder or a gun fired in 25 yersa
. the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july
,
and the mayor
, larry vaughn
( murray hamilton
)
, doesn ' t want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money
. brody is joined by matt hooper
( richard dreyfuss
)
, a young
, ambitious shark expert fomr yhe marine institute
. hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined tothe help brody stop it
-
- his knowledge about the excact workings of the shark
(
" it ' s a perfect engine
, an eating machine
"
) make it that much more terrifying
. when vaughn finally relents
, hooper
and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint
( robert shaw
) on his decrepit boat
, the orca
, to search forthe the shark
. the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark
,
annd inevitably
, are hunted by it
.
" jaws
" is a thriller iwth a keen sense of humor
and an incredible sense of pacing
, tension
,
and horror
. it is like ten movies all rolled into one
,
and it ' s noone wonder it tookover america by storm in the summer of 1975
, taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time
( until it was unceremoniously dethroned inaddition 1977 by
" star wars
"
)
. even today
, fascination witht this film is on par with hitchcock ' s
" psycho
,
"
and it never seems to age
.
allthough grand new technology exists thta makes the technical sequences
, including several mechanical sharks
, obsolete
, none ofthe it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill
. the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely onthe traditional cinematic elements like pacing
, characterization
, sharp editing
,
and creative photography
, instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects
. scheider
, dreyfuss
,
and shaw were known actors at the time
" jaws
" was made
,
but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman
. nevertheless
, this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance
and refused to be overshadowed by the shark
. scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband
and father caught in the political quagmire of donig what ' s right
and going against the entire town
.
" it ' s your first summer here
, you nkwo
,
" mayor vaughn warns him
. dreyfuss
, who had previously been seen in
" american graffiti
"
( 1973
)
and
" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz
"
( 1974
) gives a surprisingly mature
, complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids
and teenagers
.
however
, most oustanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie ' s captain ahab
, a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards
. bordering of parody
, shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism
. he ' s slightly deranged
,
and shaw ' s performance is almost a caricature
.
however
, there is one scene late in hte film
, when he
and brody
and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars
. quint is drawed into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u
. s
. s
. indianapolis
, a navy ship in world war ii tyhat was sunk by the japanese
. his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1
, 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair
- raising than anything spielberg put on screen
. shaw delivers teh story in one long take
,
adn it is the best acting in the film
. of course
, we can ' t leave out the shark itself
; with its black eyes
, endless rows of teeth
,
and insatiable urge to eat
, it is basically the epitome of all mankind ' s fears about waht is unknown
and threatening in nature
. a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real
-
- having survived sinch the dinosaurs
, great whites dont exist
, they can be as large as the shark in
" jaws
,
"
and they are a threat
. every one of spielberg ' s subjective underwater shots makes us fiel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark
: a bunch of writihing
, dangling
, completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into
. the shark in
" jaws
" was actually a combination ofthe actual footage
and five different mecanical sharks
( all nicknamed
" bruce
" by the crew
) built to be shot from different angles
. many have forgotten
,
but
" jaws
" was a sort of precursor to
" waterworld
"
( 1995
)
, a movie ' s who soggy production
and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb
.
but
, as we can see now
, spielberg overcame all the obstacles
,
and delivered oney of the finest primal scare
- thrillers ever to come out ofthe hollywood
.
