" i ' d rather die today
and go to heaven than live to be a hundered
and go to hell
,
" earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher
. with that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister
, hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story
. he will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american
,
and all ofthe his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation
. from elmer gantry on
, we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church
. well
, think again
, forthe the apostle
, which robert duvall has wanted to make fo over a decade
, does not take hte usual tack of smearing the minister
,
and by implication all
, the rest of organized religion
. instead it gives us a highly devout man
, who certainly has his foibles
,
but with an absolute dedication to his ministry
and his god
.
and argubly just as surprising
, the good
- spirited film is no comedy
, even if it doens have humorous moments
. instead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion picturesk
. when in thte privacy of his attic
, robert duvall
, as texas preacher euliss
" sonny
" dewey
, argues sternly with his lord
, the scene shares a kinship with emily watson ' s character crying out for her god in breaking the waves ' s most powerful scene
. the body of the story starts with sonny ' s coming upon an horrific auto accident
, which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters
. with his well worn bible in hand
, sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over
and wtih the accident ' s dying victims
. the scowling police officer orders him to go away
,
and
, after he has tried tothe work his miracles
, sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lord ' s work
. robert duvall not only gives a moving
and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination
but is also the film ' s director
, writer
, executive producer
,
and chief financier
. rarely has a movie been such a labor of love
. with a white suit
, peach
- colored shirt
and tie
,
and dark sunglases
, sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher
. duvall has every movement down pat
. even when he is walking down thge street
, tghe ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy
. he dances
annd claps all the way
. sonny ' s churches having more black members than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deep
- voiced balck orators
,
but his rhetoric is always competitive
.
" i may be on the devil ' s hit
- list
,
but i ' m on god ' s mailing list
,
" he shouts to the congregation inwhich a revival tent
.
and they lap it up
. people jump up
, scream
,
" praise the lord
!
"
and mean it
. the intensity of their shared religious experience isnt palpable
.
but sonny is no saint
. it turns out that he has a wandering eye
, which angers his wief jessie
, played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett
. jessie gets her revenge by taking uv with the church ' s youth minister
and conniving to gain control over sonny ' s church
, leaving him unemployed
. sonny
, letting his temper get the best ofthe him
, does something foolish
, which causes him to have to leave town
and two beloved kids forever
. the bulk of the film occurs in a small
, predominately black church in louisiana
, which he builds up from a derelict building with no congregation into a remodeled church
(
" one way road to heaven
: holiness temple
"
) withthe an enthusiastic flock
. in this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e
. f
. the apostle is a hard worker willing to take onthe any odd job necessary to obtain the funds for his church
. he asks his members to tithe
,
but he gives all ofthe his money
.
and his ogod deeds extend to secrte donations of food for the local poor folks
. a man who can ' t stand to be still
, he tells one of his firends
,
" i quitted school because i didn ' t like recess
.
" in his new town he meets toosie
( miranda richardson
)
, who
, like him
, has a family that she hasn ' t seen in a while
. his romance wih the separated woman
, like teh rest ofthe the film
, doesn ' t follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies
. billy bob thornton shows up one day playing a local racist
and general troublemaker
. his confrontation with the apostle is
yet another of show ' s many surprising scenes
, again breaking many rules
and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take
.
although it probably couldn ' t have ended any other way
, the movie does wrap things up nicely
.
and don ' t miss the sweet epilogue during the film ' s closing credits
. a tour de force acting performance by duvall
and a surprising
and unrelentingly dedicated script makes forthe an outstanding
and moving film
. the apostle runs a little too long at 2
: 12
. it is rated pg
- 13 for mild profanity
and brief violence
and would be fine for kids eleven
anbd up
.
