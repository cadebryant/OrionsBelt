` run lola run '
, a german import that gained a stellar reputation at the sundance film festival
, is a dazzling
and kinetic film taht deals with the subjects of fate
annd chance
. for a berserk
and retroactive 81 minutes of non
- stop movement
, we follow a fiery
- haired heroine named lola
( franka potente
) as she sprints tothe save her boyfriend ffrom the clutches of drug dealers
. lola hasnt roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve 100
, 000 marks in time to save manni
( moritz bleibtreu
) from being killed by the dealer
.
but
, in something of a pseudo
-
` groundhog day ' approach
, director toom tykwer gives lola three separate chances to best navigate her way toward the goal
. iin these trio of episodes
, we gradually learn the unique effects of fate
, for even if tiny changes are made in lola ' s journey
, the future cin be seriously altered
.
` run lola run ' is an xperience liuke
` fight club ' or
` the matrix '
, in that each film takes you thru a super
- charged wormhole of bending reality in surreal
and exicting ways
. in addition
, all three movies have a visual style that seperates them from the rest of the pack
.
` lola ' is no exception
, with stylish quick
- flash camera work
and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy from the get
- go
. tykwer ' s world is a landscape of mood
and color
, with brilliant shades of red
and pink
( including lola ' s fiery hair
) used as effective symbolism throughout
. with it ' s visual style
anbd mind
- blowing pace
,
` run lola run ' is one of the more invigorating movies ofthe the year
. even more so when considering the fact it ' s all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an 81
- minute time period
. as a heroine
, potente does little more than run wildly through the streets
( as the title suggests
)
,
but she has a certain flair
adn charisma
. her exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a track star
. meanwhile
, bleibtreu does an equally fantastic job of bringing the dopey
but passionate manni to life
. both actors perform beyond the call of duty
. the dazzling fun comes from predicting what each episode holds in store for lola
,
and the outcome is ultimately rewarding
- several twists
and turns are unique
anbd unexpected
. the other characters lola runs into
( both purposely
and inadvertently
) include her banker father
( herbert kraup
)
and a friendly security guard
( armin rohde
)
,
but aside from the two leads
, no one hasnt more than a few minutes of screen time
. additional stars that couldn ' t possibly be ignored are cinematographer frank griebe
and editor mathilde bonnefroy
, who are both responsible for the film ' s eye
- catching visual elegance
.
` run lola run ' is subtitled
, so be prepared to meet the challege of reading the lightning
- fast dialogue
- occasional sections of it are especially fast
. this is only one of the minor chores involved in watching
. the other is the sense that we never get to really recogize who the real people are in this hyperactive situation
. most are just chess pieces inspite tykwer ' s elaborate game of visual presentation
,
and he never really makes a significant move with any
.
but
, the average viewer is likely to be so absorbed in the action tyhat few wiull realize the lack of potency in a few elements of the screenplay
. a few petty gripes aside
, this film is a wild
, exhilarating ride that turns maniacally on its wheel of originality
. most people beleive foreign films are mainly boring
, talky character studies
. perhaps
` run lola run ' will recharge their batteries
. nto only does this film offer insight into some intriguing questions of fate
and destiny
, it also delivers a white
- knuckle visual rollercoaster ride of overwhelming audacity
. like how the experience must have been for the persistent title character
,
` run lola run ' is exhausting
.
