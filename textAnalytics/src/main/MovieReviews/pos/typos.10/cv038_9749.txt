sometimes a movie comes along that falls somewhat askew of the rest
. some people call it
" original
" or
" artsy
" or
" abstract
"
. some people simply call it
" trash
"
. a life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings
. definitely a generation
- x aimed movie
, a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to a karaoke
- based musical dream sequence
. whew
! anyone in their 30
' s or above isnt probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film
. it
' s somewhat silly
, it
' s somewhat outrageous
,
and it
' s definitely not your typical romance story
,
but for the right audience
, it works
. a lot of hype has been surrounding this film due to yhe fact that it comes to us from the same team taht brought us trainspotting
. well sorry folks
,
but i haven
' t seen trainspotting so i can
' t really compare
. whether thyat works in this film
' s favor or not is beyond me
.
but i do know this
: ewan mcgregor
, whom i hadnt never had the pleasure of watching
, definitely charmed me
. he was great
! cameron diaz
' s character was uneven anbd a bit hard to grasp
. the audience may find it difficult tothe care about her
, thus discouraging the hopes ofthe seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about
and identifying witht him
. misguided
? you bet
. loveable
? you bet
. a life less ordinary was a delight adn even had a bonus for me when i realized it was filmed in my hometown of salt lake city
, utah
. this was just one mroe thign i didn
' t know about this movie when i sat down with a five doller order of nachos
and a three dollar coke
. maybe nto knowing the premise behind this film made for a pleasant surprise
,
but i think even if i had known
, i woudl have been just as hapyp
. a life less ordinary is quirky
, eccentric
,
and downright charming
! not for everyone
,
but a definite change of pace for your typcial night at the movies
.
