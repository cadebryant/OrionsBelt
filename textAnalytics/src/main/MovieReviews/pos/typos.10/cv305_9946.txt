of all the films i
' ve come to see this year
( 1997
)
, i think only chasing amy had as many
" laugh
- out
- loud
" moments
. i
' m not saying that i was hysterically rolling on the floor while watching waiting for guffman
,
but my mouth burst open with at least a delighted guffaw at least every couple of minutes
.
and i thikn i
' m the kind of person that laughs least at movies
, even when i find them funny
. usually all you can get out of me is a warm smile
, so to get me laughing out loud
,
and so frequently
, is a really good sign
. waiting for guffman is the story ofthe blaine
, missouri
, a town celebrating it
' s 150th anniversary
,
and the musical that is being put on for the big event
. the play is being directed by corky st
. clair
( christopher guest
, who also wrote
and directed this
" mockumentary
" as well as co
- writing several original musical numbers
)
, tjhe effeminate broadway hopeful determined to make this prodcution a smashing success
. teaming up with st
. clair are a h
andful of blaine residents
: allan pearl
( eugene levy
)
, a jewish dentist who spended his youth not as the class clown
,
but sitting right enxt to him
and studying him
, ron
and sheila albertson
( fred willard
and catherine o
' hara respectively
)
, a married couple setting their sights on hollywood
, libby mae brown
( parker posey
)
, the dense
but fun queen of the dairy queen
,
and a few others
. everybody in htis movie is brilliant
, absolutely so
,
but levy particularly st
ands out
. these characters are portrayed with such saddening realism that you can
' t help
but love them
, as pathetic as they really are
.
al
though levy st
ands out
, guest
, willard
, o
' hara
,
and posey are all wonderful
and definitely should be commended for their performances
! if there was an oscar for an ensemble performence
, this is the group tath should sweep it
. some humer was a tad uneven from the rest of the film
and
, even after starting very humorously
, they nearly lost me with the tad
- too
- long intros
. as delightful as it was
, it began to get monotonous
. thankfully
, just as your about to say
" ok
, maybe i should run to the bathroom
"
, they finally get past the intros
and onto the rehearsal scenes
. like a play
, this film gives a veyr three
- act feel
, the intros
( funny
,
but almost too long
)
, the rehearsals
( even funnier
)
,
and finally
, the actual peformance ofthe the play
( excellent
!
)
. like i said
, each character realy shines
, even wehn done with a subtle approach
. you can
' t really watch theese people anbd not think they
' re real people
! even they way they talk
, with awkward pauses
and stumbles that don
' t feel staged at all
, yuo feel like you
' re watching a real
, albeit funny
, documentary
.
and even with silly lyrics
, the original songs when the play is finally put onthe
, are absolutely wonderfull
! as a word ofthe note
, despite it
' s
" r
" rating
, waiting for guffman is really quite clean
. this rating came from a brief
, very breef use of the gr
and
- daddy of all swear words
. even if that realy bothers you
, let me say that it
' s not presented in a vulgar
, cheap
- laugh way
. it
' s actually qutie humorous
and tastefully done
! it might be hard knowing what tothe expect with waiting for guffman
. it
' s silly humor
,
but it
' s also so dry
, subtle
, annd intelligently done that you
' re nto insulted by it
. it
' s always really nice to see a comedy that isn
' t all slapstick
and vulgarity
,
and this film is one of the better ones of the better ones
! i
' d recommend seeing it
!
