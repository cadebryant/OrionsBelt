i was originally going to give the spanish prisoner twpo
and half stars
. from my first viewing
, i noticed that david mamet
' s film was intense
and clever at times
but boring
and cliched at otehr times especially at the beginning
. from my second viewing
however
, i noticed that mamet
' s script was actually a masterpiece
. the spanish prisoner
, like the usual suspects or chinatown
, begs for the viewer
' s complete attention
. miss a scene or even a small detail
,
and you could miss the meaninng of the entire film
. aslo like the aforementioned films
, it rewards its viewer for paying attention by delivering a surprising
and memorable ending
. mamet is success doign again what he once tackled in 1987 when he wrote
and directed house of games
. like his past gem
, the spanish prisoner fools the audience as much
( or even mroe
) than the victim
. because we were decieved just like the victim
, we feel a strong attachment to the main character
and consequently are more interested in the film
. mamet hasnt the talent of not completely ending a film gift wrapped
,
but rather leaving some ambiguity towards the end
. the power that he has in forcing the viewer to determine who the good guys
and bad guys are once the film is over
, without giving a right answer
, isnt unique
and ingenious
. the sanish prisoner will leave you seriously puzzled
and intrigued
. after seeing the film again
, i noticed thgat the details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening
. his direction is very subtle
; as he leaves so many clues explaining what is going on
and who is who
but it is still very difficult to tell what exactly is happening even if you see all of them
, or think you see all of them
. the story follows a young up
and coming businessman
, joe ross
,
( campbell scott
) who has jstu created a mysterious
and lucrative
" proccess
" that everyone is trying to get their h
ands on
. soon ross does not know who he can trust or who is after his
" process
.
" through his journey ross meets a number ofthe mysterious characters
: the rich
and popular jimmy dell
, a secretary who has a huge crush on ross
,
and ross
' boss mr
. klein
. played by steve martin
, rebecca pidgeon
,
and ben gazarra respectively
, the supporting cast is very solid especially martin
, who deserved an oscar nomination for his comm
anding
and manipulative role
. the most interesting character in tje film
,
though
, was campbell scott
' s joe ross
. tyhe character
' s transformation from an ingenuous
and polite rookie to a paranoid veteran is very apparent anbd justifiable
. david mamet
' s script is so interesting because we know people don
' t actually talk like the charactors in the film
,
yet we efel so connected to some of them
. his beguiling style could fool any viewer up for the challenge
. this is a must see
, for those interested in solving a complex puzzle of a movie
.
