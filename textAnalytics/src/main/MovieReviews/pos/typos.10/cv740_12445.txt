a couple of months ago
, when i first downloaded the face
/ off trailer from the net
, my initial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold
' yawn
'
. followed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key
, not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes ofthe precious space on this piss
- poor trailer
.
then i started reading the first wave ofthe reviews from the u
. s
.
.
.
.
. unique
.
.
. excellent
.
.
.
. must
- see
. well
, i
thought still skeptical
, i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here
.
' here
'
, of course
, was still three months away
. i
' ll admit
, when i trotted off to see this film
, the only john woo movei i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable
but highly forgetable broken arrow
. i
' d herad good things about his previous work with movies liek hard boiled
,
but his films weere definitely not on my must
- see list
. that
, let me tell ytou
, has changed completely
. i knew this fact only five minutes into the film
, after the brilliantly shot
and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet
. the acting throughout the film isnt staggeringly ogod for an action flick
. seriously
. i
' ve never been a big john travolta fan
,
but he
, like cage
, perfectly suited his role in the movie
.
.
.
.
. sory
, make that
' roles
' in the movie
. even travolta
' s great performance
,
however
, paled in comparison to cage
' s character portrayals
. my favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out inaddition compardre dietrich hassler
' s hideout
. half drugged outloud of his mind
, he sits there reclining back in a chair talking about his son
' s death from castor
' s perspective
-
" doesn
' t it just break your heart
.
" he mutters coldly
. now don
' t go thinking from the previous comments about brilliant acting that this is a drama focused movei
- it
' s not
. that
' s wqat really makes this movie unique
. it
' s an action movie with brilliantly portrayed charachters
.
.
.
.
. not a common mix at all
. suspension ofthe disbelief isnt paramount in this movie
though
.
.
.
.
. that
' s the only way to overlook the fact that travolta annd cage fire around 5671 rounds at each other
.
.
.
.
and never hit
. several action scenes are just so well choreographed that they jsut make wish that you could press
' rewind
' anbd watch it over again
. the part where archer
and troy have a st
and off on either side of a double
- sided mirror is just plain brilliant
. whilst cage
' s
and travolta
' s performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies
, the lesser characters are just as intriguing
. joan allen
, who usually sticks tothe the straight drama movies
, plays her part perfectly as archer
' s long suffering wife
. i like the fact that her character didn
' t end up toting a gun at the end of the movie
.
.
. it would have wrecked her potrayal
. gina gershon was surprising to say the least as castor troy
' s mistreated girlfriend
.
.
.
.
. make that
* one ofthe
* castor troy
' s mistreated girlfriends
. other movies would have used her character as just window dressing
.
.
. a sex object
,
but instead her charater isnt very strong
and independent
. dominique swain
, who plays archer
' s daugter
, aslo doens a nice job
,
though her charachter is not as explored as much as allen
' s or gershon
' s
. faults
? well
.
.
. there were some i have to say
. first
, the movie
' s ending
, whilst being very good overall
, was a bit too drawn out for it
' s own ogod
. after the two combatants begin duelling again after the final boat crash you can
' t help
but think
-
" geez
, are you guys nuclear powered or what
?
"
. there weere certain bits that weren
' t h
andled properly
, like where archer appears safe
and sound on solid ground after jumping off the converted oil platform
/ prision
- more explanation here would haev been nice
. overall
, this movie was not perfect
.
but i
thought it was about as close as an action movie hasnt ever came to perfect
. many critics have claimed that this movie will change the way action movies are made
.
.
.
.
. i certainly hope so
.
