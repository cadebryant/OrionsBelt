a lot of times a three
- star film will be my favorite
. htey ' re usually the kind of movie i can watch most often too
. they ' re usally not too deep
, allowing forthe semi
- brainless relaxation
,
and at the same time
, not too dumb
. men in black is a four
- star three
- star film
.
( hope you could follow that one
) men in balck doesn ' t wait tothe get to the fun
. just minutes into the film we are intruduced to agent kay
( tommy lee jones
)
, introduced to an alien
,
and introduced to the the awesome memory
- diminishing tool that all mib agents use
. after all
, you can ' t have alien witnesses running around with taht kind of knowledge can you
? men in black is
, of course
, the organization whcih
" moniters all extra
- terrestrial activity on earth
"
. nypd officer james edwards
( will smith
)
, is on a routine foot chase when suddenly the no
- good punk he ' s chasing starts leaping up buildings
and blinking more than one pair of eyes
. tje alien delivers the simple message that the world is going to end
,
and with that
, dives off of a roof
. naturually nobody believes his story
.
.
. nobody that is
, except for the top secret organization that nto even the govorment is aware ofthe
. edwards
then meets agent kay
, the man who never seems to crack a smile
,
and is introduced to the mib
. edwards winds up joining the team
and is stripped ofthe anything taht can point back to him
( birth certificate
, drivers ilcense
,
and even the literal removal of his fingerprints
)
. james edwards no longer exists
. meet agent jay
. agent kay takes the rookie jay under his wing as they go about
" regular
" duties
. eventually a far more treacherous event comes into play
. a
" bug
" has landed on earth
and is going to wipe out mankind if these two don ' t
( or can ' t
) stop it
. the plot isn ' t exactly clear
,
but we know it has to do with a galaxy as big as a jewel or marble being sought after on earth
,
annd that is crucial that the mib find it before the
" bug
" does
. barry sonnenfeld
, who also did the addams family films
, directs this nicely
. it ' s fun
, it ' s funny
, it ' s action
- packed
. a nice summer blockbuster as it rightfully turned out to be
. this is one of those movies that is just
" fun
"
and cxan ' t really be summed up any nicer or clearer
. will smith
and tommy lee jones both do great jobs
and both are a blast to watch
. definitely one of the best films of thte the summer of ' 97
, men in black comes highly recommeded from me
!
