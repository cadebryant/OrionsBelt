a lot of times a three
- star film will be my favorite
. they
' re usually the kind of movie i can watch most often too
. they
' re usually not too deep
, allowing for semi
- brainless relaxation
,
and at the same time
, not too dumb
. men in black is a four
- star three
- star film
.
( hope you coudl follow that one
) men inaddition black doesn
' t wait tothe get to the fun
. just minutes into the film we are introduced to agent kay
( tommy lee jones
)
, introduced to an aline
,
and introduced to the the awesome memmory
- diminishing tool that all mib agents use
. aftter all
, you can
' t have alien witnesses running around with that kind of knowledge can you
? men in black is
, of course
, the organization which
" moniters all extra
- terrestrial activity on earth
"
. nypd officer james edwards
( will smith
)
, is on a routine foot chase when suddenly the no
- ogod punk he
' s chasing starts leaping up buildings anbd blinking more than one pair of eyes
. the alien delivers the simple message that the world isnt going to end
,
and with that
, dives off of a roof
. naturally nobody believes his story
.
.
. nobody that is
, except for tghe top secret organization that not even the government is aware of
. edwards
then meets agent kay
, the man who never seems to crack a smile
,
and is introduced to the mib
. edwards winds up joining the team
and is stripped of anything that can point back to him
( birth certificate
, drivers liscense
, anbd even the literal removal of his fingerprints
)
. james edwards no longer exists
. meet agent jay
. agent kay takes the rookie jay under his wing as they go about
" regular
" duties
. eventually a far more treacherous event comes into play
. a
" bug
" has l
anded on earth
and is going to wipe out mankind if these twpo don
' t
( or can
' t
) stop it
. tje plot isn
' t exactly claer
,
but we know it has to dont with a galaxy as big as a jewel or marble being sought after on earth
,
and that is crucial that the mib find it before the
" bug
" does
. barry sonnenfeld
, who also did the addams family films
, directs this nicely
. it
' s fun
, it
' s funny
, it
' s acation
- packed
. a nice summer blockbuster as it rightfully turned out to be
. this is noe of those movies that is just
" fun
"
and can
' t really be summed uv any nicer or clearer
. will smith adn tommy lee jones both dont great jobs anbd both are a blast to watch
. definitely one of the best films of the the summer of
' 97
, men in black comes highly recommeded ffrom me
