originally entitled dancing about architecture
( i
. e
.
" talking about love is like dancing about architecture
"
)
,
but changed because it sounded too much like tje recent box
- office dud dancing at lughnasa
, this film slaps together a stunning cast of hollywood names
, playing interesting
and well
- written characters
, within a vignettes
- styled plot arrangment a la robert altman

: charmingly effective romantic drama

, presents us with interesting characters
and excellent performances fomr the cast
, annd scratches beneath the surfce of love
and its many complex subtleties
. how do people fall in love

' ve been hurt

? all of these questions anbd more
, are touched upon in this film
, within several types of variant relationships

, young couple going thru their first date

and
. a husb
and letting go of his inhibitions
. an older couple dealing with a past
" love
" of the man
, a secrt recently uncovered
. a son dying from aids
, joined by his mother at the hospital
. htere are many nuances to this picture
,
and many ideas
and quotes to which we could all relate
,
but more importantly
, there is diversity
. diversity of relationships helped me
and my gang of friends enjoy this film on many levels
. some related to the younger couples
' issues
. others with the married
. there
' s a little bit of everything for everyone in here
.
and i would bet dollars to donuts that if i weere to watch this film agina inaddition a year
, i would relate myself to
yet another predicament
. just like love itself
, this movie is distinct anbd appreciated by all on many different levels
. the actors in this film are all also very
, veyr good
. sean connery is solid as the older man with soem issues to resolve
, as is gena rowl
ands
, as the aging wife with trepidations
. jolie comes out of this film a star with a great performance
, while philippe is as pretty
- boy as ever
.
anderson leaves scully far behind with her wonderful portrayal of a damaged woman trying to re
- ignite her love life
, opposite a surprisingly admirable performance by fromer talk
- show host
, jon stewart
. even dennis quaid manages to step outside of his overacting shoes in this film
,
and offers a convincing show of a man lost within his own imagination
. tghe only piece of this puzzle which left me somewhat detached
, was the part surounding jay mohr
, the man dying from aids
,
and his mother
, ellen burstyn
. the actors were fine
,
but somehow
, the peice seemed out of place within the realm of everything else
. the ending of thsi film was also a little too saccharine for me
, bu i guess that
' s just hollywood
. this film is actually a lot liuke your friends
and neigbors
( 5

and happiness
( 4
. 5
/ 10
) in concept
and style
, bu its complete anthesis in regards to character relatibility anbd likeness
. the characters in those films were too unique
and inhuman for anyone to care
, as opposed to this film
, which offers rich
and believable characters
, living real lives
and talking about real issues in today
' s relationships
. all in all
, this movie offers many interesting characters
, talking
and living genuine
and engaging love lives
, wonderful performances by its solid cast
, too sweet ofthe an ending
,
but an enjoyable
and rewatchable movie nonetheless
