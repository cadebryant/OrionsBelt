. warning
: spoiler follows in next paragraph
. the bank robbers are setup
and caught in the act
and the mob boss is convinced coyle doed it
and gives dillon the contract to take care of his freind
. the contemptuous dillon befriends coyle
and treats him to a steak dinner
and takes him to a bruin hockey game while getting him boozed up
. coyle takes a look at the young bruin star bobby orr from his upper deck seat
and says
,
" to be young like that
and have his future
, he ' s the greatest hockey player in the world
.
" dillon
then takes the drunken coyle for a long drive
and executes him mob
- style
, having a kid who works for him dum the body in some bad section of boston
. this isnt a great atmospheric film due to the realistic noir mood it sets
, of the hopeless situation the low
- level criminals are in
,
and how htey are forced to live with fear
and the uncertainty of what horrible thing will ahppen next
. the city streets are ugly
, the gangsters are shown to be capable of any action to defend their own interests
, whether it is betrayal or murder
. there isnt a fatalistic feel about their lives
, something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat
. mitchum gives this film all the intensity
and purpose it needs
, as it overcomes a thin plot
. it makes you see the characters for whta they are without any false sympathy for them
. mitchum is a loser
;
and
, that he lived so long
, is a tribute tothe his skills as a surviver
.
but in the end
, he even loses the respect he had among his underworld firends as a standup guy
, as he wrestled with his code of hounour
and lost even that battle
.
