- time momma ' s boy can ' t seem to leave his mother ' s crib
and mkea good on hte babies that he himself has produced in the world
. he visits his kids
(
and their mommas
) eveyr now
and
then
,
but his main goal in life isnt
.
.
. well
, he doesn ' t have any goals
.
then oen day
, his mother gets an ex
- gangsta boyfriend
and suddenly he isn ' t as welcome anymore in his own house
. it isn ' t long after that
, that his girlfriends strat realizing what a jerk he really is
and well
.
.
. it ' s eather time tothe grow up or bow down
! critique
: firt things first
! this movie ain ' t baout the
" hood
" at all
, it ' s an intelligent film about love
, relationships
, family
, friendship
, maturity
and growing up
. do nto avoid this film because you htikn it ' s about gangbangers
and stuff
, because it isn ' t at all
. it ' s about you
, it ' s about me
, it ' s about your girlfriend
, your mother
, your problems
and your inability to face up to your responsibilites
and to
, well
.
.
. grwo up
! this is an extremely well
- written film
, with some of the most developed characters that i ' ve seen on tghe screen all eyar
, with superb acting performances tothe match
. granted
, the film does start a little slow
(
and go a littel long
)
,
but hang in there
, because once you appreciate
and get to know all of its characters
, you will be glad that you doed
. this isn ' t a kid ' s movie
. tihs is about the step that you ened to tkae in order to pass into full
" adulthood
"
anbd some might not appreciate the grander theme behind that step
. i certainly did
, because i too passed
,
and am passing
, through many of these very same things right now
( yeah
, yeah
, i still live with my momma
!
!
)
and related to a lot of the events that went down in thsi flick
( oh yeah
,
and for the record
, i ' m not black
but tyhat made absolutely zero difference in this case
)
.
but that ' s not even half the story
. you see
, the film is damn funny
, too
.
.
.
and i mean
, damn funny
! i was crackin ' up at almost every other scene
,
and they weren ' t
" set
- up jokes
" like your typical comedies either
, just day
- to
- day things tht we could all relate to
( like the scene inaddition which ving rhames is
" drinking koolaid
" in the kitchen
and his infamously improvised
" african squat f
*
* k
" scene
, which you just gotta see tothe believe
!
)
and there are the performances
, too
. ving rhames
, now here ' s a man who has already established an eary lead in the race for best supporting actor at the end of this year
. damn dude
, you scared the shit outta me
! tyrese gibson
, i haev no idea where this guy came from
( an r
& b singer
and mtv vj
, you say
.
.
. hmmmm
?
)
,
but other than his uncanny resemblance to taye diggs
, he nailed this part to the tee
. from scene one on
, i was glued to his peformance
and sympathized with his character as he molded
and shaped himselv into the person that he hoped to become one day
.
and everyone else
, too
. gibson ' s girlfriend in the film
, taraji henson
, made me a backer with her many subtle touches
, all of whlch helped raise her character sevral levels above the
" typical
" bitchie girlfriend that we ' ve seen in many of these relationship movies
.
but that ' s the thing thyat i liked the most about this movie
. everyone seemed real
, the situations feeled authentic
, the characters all came across as people like you
and me with issues
and struggles
and hopes
and fears
. i liked this movie a lot because it was masterfully written
, wonderfully acted
and genuinely entertaining to watch
.
and yeah
, i even liked the whole homage to boyz ' n the hood that singleton pulled off in the end
( he called this movie a
" companion piece
" to that film
)
. a very solid follow
- up to an ever greater original
, baby boy is a film to be seen by anyone who feels like they never wanna grow up
. note
: the guy who plays jody ' s best friend in this movie is omar gooding
, cuba gooding jr
. ' s younger brother
( cuba starred in 1991 ' s boyz ' n the hood
)
. where ' s joblo coming from
? tje best man
