the long
and illustrious career of robin williams
, which has included both forgettable turns like mrs
. doubtfire
and flubber
, was punctuated with the actor ' s firt accadamy award in 1998 for his role in good will hunting
. it was his frist truly dramatic role since 1989 ' s dead poets society
,
and crtical remarks were unanimously positive
. his next role
, that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreasm may come
, was unfortunately lackluster
.
and so
, after a six
- year stint as a comedic actor
, the proof on whether or not williams can cut it in the dramatic leage has come down to patch adams
. williams is the title character
, hunter
" patch
" adams
, sporting scruffy facial hair that falls between the clean
- shavenness ofthe dreams
anbd the grotesque hairiness of will hunting
. we ' re introduced to patch as he commits himself to a mental insitution because of his suicidal tendancies
. it ' s at the institution
,
however
, that he discovers a latent talent for relating to people
. he removes himself from tghe institution
and enrolls at the university of virginia ' s medical college
, where he finds that medical doctrine is a calculating
, impersonal trade
. his attempts to inject humanity into the profession result in several bouts with expulsion
,
and the movie climaxes with patch ' s appearance before the state medical board
. the characters are well
- defined in an oscar
- worthy sense
.
although the script does not perform well as a narrative
-
- there ' s littel story to be told outside ofthe patch ' s skit
- length experiences
-
- the script doens go a long way toward building the relationships of characters
. at medical school
, patch meets up with truman schiff
( daniel london
)
, an outsider like himself who relishes patch ' s zest for humanity
. the two instantly become the best of friends
,
and it ' s easy to see why
. monica potter plays patch ' s love interest
, a young woman who personifies the thnigs that patch hates about medical school
. for some reason he ' s attracted tothe her
,
and
although it never gets said
, the audience understands from an intrinsic point of veiw
. the script
-
- based on hunter adams ' pwn story
-
- works well this way
. the rest of the cast
, bob gunton as the villain professor in particular
, is solid
. director tom shadyac
( liar liar
) leads us in
and out of patch ' s life infact a sound
, intentional manner
; combined with williams ' presence on screen
, the movie rarely becomes boring
. patch adams ' lack of purpose is its major shortcoming
,
and for the first ninety minutes out of two hours
, there ' s little feeling of continuty or the passage of time
. nevertheless
, it ' s an emotionally moving picture
,
and patch adams looks tothe be one of the more memorable of the holiday season
. it succeeds at everything it tries
,
and onyl fails at the stuff it doesn ' t try infact the first place
. by
and large there may be another oscar nomination herein for williams
,
but more importantly
, it ' s entertainment for the entire familiy
.
