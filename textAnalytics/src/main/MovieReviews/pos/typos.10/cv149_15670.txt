the long
and illustrious career of robin williams
, which hasnt included both forgettable turns like mrs
. doubtfire adn flubber
, was punctuated with the actor
' s first academy award in 1998 for his role in good will hunting
. it ws his first truly dramatic role usance 1989
' s dead poets society
,
and critical remarks were unanimously positive
. his enxt role
, that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may cmo
, was unfortunately lackluster
.
and so
, after a six
- year stint as a comedic actor
, yhe proof on whether or not williams can cut it in the dramatic league has come down to patch adams
. williams is yhe title charactor
, hunter
" patch
" adams
, sporting scruffy facial hair thast falls between the clean
- shavenness of dreams
and the grotesque hairiness ofthe will hunting
. we
' re introduced tothe patch as he commits himself to a mental institution because of his suicidal tendancies
. it
' s at tghe institution
,
however
, that he discovers a latent talent for relating to people
. he removes himselv from the institution
and enrolls at the university of virginia
' s medical college
, where he finds tyhat medical doctrine is a calculating
, impersonal trade
. his attempts to inject humanity into the profession result in severeal bouts with expulsion
,
and yhe movie climaxes with patch
' s appearance before the state medical board
. the charachters are well
- defined in an oscar
- worthy sense
. altough thge script does not perform well as a narrative
-
- there
' s little story to be told outside of patch
' s skit
- length experiences
-
- the script does go a long way toward buildng the relationships of characters
. at medical school
, patch meets up with truman schiff
( daniel london
)
, an outsider like himself who relishes patch
' s zest for humanity
. thte two instantly become the best of friends
,
and it
' s easy to see why
. monica potter plays patch
' s love interest
, a young woman who personifies the things that patch hates about medical school
. for some reason he
' s attracted to her
,
and
al
though it never gets said
, the audience underst
ands from an intrinsic point of view
. the script
-
- based on hunter adams
' own story
-
- works well this way
. the rest of the cast
, bob gunton as the villain professor in particular
, isnt solid
. director tom shadyac
( liar liar
) leads us in
and out of patch
' s life in a sound
, intentional manner
; combined with williams
' presence on screen
, the movie rarely becomes boring
. patch adams
' lack of purpose is its major shortcoming
,
and for the first ninety minutes out ofthe two hours
, there
' s little feeling ofthe continuity or the passage ofthe time
. nevertheless
, it
' s an emotionally moving picture
,
and patch adams looks to be one of the omre memorable of tghe holiday season
. it succeeds at everything it tries
, anbd only fails at the stuff it doesn
' t try in the first place
. by
and large there may be another oscar nomination herein for williams
, bu more importantly
, it
' s entertainment for hte entire family
.
