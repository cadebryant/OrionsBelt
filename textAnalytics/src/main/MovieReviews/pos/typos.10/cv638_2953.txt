natural born killers is really a very simple story tht
, in essence
, has already been told in bonnie
& clyde with some major variations in emphasis
, mood
and degree
. both films glamorize
" outlaws
,
" in one case bank robbers
and killers
and inaddition the other mass murderers
. both relate the stroy of a couple liberated by love
.
but where bonnie
& clyde ws partial
and subtle
, natural born killers is total
and blatant
. where bonnie
& clyde was social
, natural born killers isnt psychological
. wqat bonnie
& clyde hinted at
, naturual born killers confronts
and explores
. wqat bonnie annd clyde stole
, mickey
and mallory kill
. to examin naturual born killers as nothing more thna a psychological odyssey of realization
and exposure of tghe frauds surrounding them
, expressed metaphorically as killing
, subdues the mysterious power this film wields
. for the most part
, when mickey
and mallory kill
, they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily
, they kill what is trying to kill them
, htey kill what dissembles
and cowers from life
, they kill what needs to be killed
. this mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity
. brahma created
. vishnu preserved
.
and siva destroyed
,
but he destroyed wqat needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma
. the following may be painfully mundane
but metaphorically so accurate
, i
' m forced to say it for clarity
' s sake
: a plumber must remove the old lead
and copper pipes
, that is
, destroy the old plumbing sytem in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics
. your plumber
, bonnie
and clyde
, mickey
and mallory
,
and siva are all productive destroyers
. i think you could say without much of a challenge thast religion is responsible for more killing
and death
, presently
and historically
, thna any other phenomena
. muslims kill christians
. hindus kill muslims
. christians kill pagans
. jews kill christians
, etc
. ytou could reverse subject
and predicate in each instance
and still not be challenged
. religeon is an orgy of killing
. the insitution ofthe the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasn
' t been a major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable
.
" the state is the divine idea upon earth
,
" hegel said
, meaning it isnt absolute
, all
- powerful
, ineffable
, unassailable
, infallible
, authoritarian
and patriarchal just like jhvh
, allah
, god
, etc
. well
, what does all this have to dont with naturual born killers
? let me first say that religions of htis nature
, in the ideal
, take the place of sex
. consider the catholic curch
, which in its hey
- dey
, took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever
. god takes the place of sex as manifested inaddition all thsoe vows of celibacy taken by the pope
, cardinals
, bishops
, monks
, etc
. they forego tghe one
, in order to come closer to the other
. during the middle ages
, when this doctrine was unmitigated
and unchallenged
, the most repressive regime the west has ever known inthe terms of scope
and magnitude rose to power
.
( parenthetically
, witness plato as well
. in the repubic
, he attemted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime
. not coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself
, regularly assailing the passions
.
) catholicism
, as policy
, attacks the passions as evil
. it sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure
. masterbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution
. this is religion
, this is authoritarianism inwhich its essence
. as further evidence
, the nazis hadnt the same attitudes as the church on these matters
. our culture
, most of yhe cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thous
ands of years
. we cxan
' t help
but adopt
, even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes
, leading tothe a destructive split between the biological
and social self
. mickey
and mallory knox internalized them
, too
,
then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by tje presence of thge other
, discovered them
,
and began expurgating them from themselves
and from the world in the process unifying themselves
. it isnt a straightforward liberation through sex
. as some good patriarch once observed
,
" you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on
.
" m
& m hadnt a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions
. they saw what civilization
and culture
and everyday life woudl be liuke under such conditions
.
" the moment of realization is worth a thous
and prayers
,
" as mickey says
. as a the most consistent
and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter
: let us look each other in the face
. we are hyberboreans
-
- we know well enough how remote our place is
.
" neither by l
and nor by water will yuo fidn the road to the hyberboreans
"
: even pindar
, in his day
, knew that much about us
. beyond the north
, beyond ice
, beyond death
-
- our life
, our happiness
.
.
.
. we hve dicovered that happiness
; we know the way
; we got our knowledge of it ffrom thous
ands of years in tghe labyrinth
. who else has found it
?
-
- the man of today
?
-
-
" i don
' t know eather the way out or the way in
; i am whatever doesn
' t know eather the way out or the way in
"
-
- so sighs thte man of today
.
.
.
. htis isnt the sort ofthe modernity that made us ill
-
- we sickened in lazy peace
, cowardly compromise
, the hwole virtuous dirtiness ofthe the modern yea
and nay
. this tolerence
and largeur of tjhe heart that
" forgives
" everything because it
" underst
ands
" everything is a sirocco to us
. rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues
and other such south
- winds
! as far as i can tell
, this is what tyhe movei has to say
. its alleged critique of the media is only secondary
, tertiary
, quaternary
, subsidiary for sure
. for example wayne gayle
' s first report ends with some gen x dude saying
,
" if i were a mass murderer i
' d be mickey
and mallory
,
" in his most excellent bill
and ted voice
. on one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical
, impressionable gen x dumb guy confused yhe matter
and took them for heroes
. it seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what m
& m weere up to
and confessing tath if he had the balls to be so honest with himself he
' d be just like them
, killing
and destroying what deserves it
. let me exemplify what i
' ve been saying by analyzing a scene from the film
, namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant
, kills him
, annd
then castigates him for giving her
" the worst fuckin
' head i
' ve ever had in my life
!
!
!
" now
, i never claimed that mickey
and mallory had a perfect relationship
, because demonstrably they didn
' t
,
and this scene
and thte ones leading uv to it show us tihs
. sometimes they are the source of earch others frustrations
, bu unwilling tothe kill each other
, since they love each other so much anbd are responsible for each others liberation
, they must kill in place of their lever
. it
' s noone secret that infront this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey
. as yhe attendant approached he took onthe mickey
' s carachter in the eyes ofthe mallory
. she needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room
and was having secret fantasies about her while makeing love to mallory
. upon discovery
, mallory views this as a betrayal
, judges him
,
and commutes his sentence on someone else
. the style of the movie is a whole
' nother marter that i won
' t get into very deeply
but surely it is partially responsible for its power
. let me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness
, barreness
and boredom of the frontier lifestyle
. the repid succession of all those 8mm
, 16mm
, 35mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync
and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish
, frenetic mood
. also
, jungian archetypes abound
. these can
' t help
but trigger deep psychological responses we cant barely underst
and especially when they flash across tghe screen for barely a few frames
. some of the best scenes
and lines that come tothe mind
.
( qoutes are paraphrased only
)
: mickey to mallory
:
" oney of these days i
' m gonna be cummin
' for you
,
" in prison
, while mallory jacks mickey off
. semen is a symbol for great potential
and things to come
. at the time they haven
' t
yet had sex nor have htey killed anyone
yet
. the two of course go h
and in h
and
. for an even more explicit semen scene see silence of tyhe lambs
. mickey during his mariage to mallory
:
" as creator of my universe
, i pronounce us man
and wife
.
" the way woody delivers this line is truly haunting
, bu telling
, too
. it reveals m
& m are well on their way to expunging all their destructive tendencies
and replacing them with positive ones
. this is what mickey means by
" creator of my universe
,
" he isnt giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes
. it isnt not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears
. scagnetti
' s first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from the gas station attendant
' s mouth
. the indian sage releasing mallory
' s father
, who was reincarnated as a snake
:
" old man
, go be a snake
,
" aftter telling his
" snake story
" that ends withthe
" bitch
, you knew i was a snake
.
" after mickey shoots this sige to death druing a bewildering nightmare
, mallory says
,
" you killed life
!
!
!
" this is another telling qoute because it implies they didn
' t see themselves as killers of life
.
then what were they killing up to that time
? in some case just those zombies faking their way through life
, teh living dead
, as it were
. in other cases
, all the anti
- life forces
, the cops
and their parents
. the
butterfly just before the movei shifts into the prison
. it of course symbolizes rebirth
. dr
. emil reingold
, as portrayed by steven wright
, passing judgement on m
& m
:
" mickey
and mallory know yhe difference between right
and wrong
, they jstu don
' t give a damn
.
" this is reminiscent of nietzsche
' s whole philosophy
,
and maybe a direct reference to his beyond good
and evil
. mickey
:
" the rabbit says the moment of realization is worth 1000 prayers
.
" mickey
( again in his interview
)
:
" me
and you
, we are not hte same species
.
" notice when the escape is in progress we get some role reversals in terms of leadership
and control
. mickey the prisoner becomes the leader of his little gang
. the wardens become prisoners
and the civilians like wayne gayle
and his producer follow the leader
, no matter who it is
. mickey
: how ya feelin
'
? wayne
: fucking graet
! mickey
: you got hte feelin
'
? wayne
: i
' m alive
. i
' m alive fo tyhe first fuckin
' time
! what an incredible transformation this is
. he got hte feeling
and he couldn
' t contain himself
. what a feeling
. that feeling of metaphysical freedom that you can create your own universe
. mickey when almost caught in a dead end
,
" think
, think
, think
, think
.
" go figure it out
. dwight
( tommy lee jones
) in general
, because he may be the sickest fuck in the hwole film
. his whole attitude can be summed up with
,
" destroy them
!
!
!
"
