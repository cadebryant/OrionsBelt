the soldiers of three kings have taken their cue fomr movies about vietnam
.
( fitting
, since the media
- saturated gulf war became a pop entertainment
.
) while driving through a long
, flat iraqi desert
( in a humvee with a bart simpson hood ornament
)
, one of the men under special forces sgt
. maj
. archie gates
'
( who
' s steering
) comm
and requests a beach boys tune
. theese men want their apocalypse now moment
, onyl instead of surfing
, htey bop tothe the music
and skeet shoot out the back of the vehicle
, armed with automatic rifles
. our threee kings
( okay
, four
) are good fighters
,
but they don
' t necessarily take operation desert storm seriously
- it
' s a reprieve from thier hellish day jobs
. they are gates
, new father sgt
. troy barlow
( wahlberg
)
, sgt
. chief elgin
( cube
)
,
and pvt
. conrad vig
( music video director jonze
)
. at story
' s start
, president bush has declared a ceasefire
,
and american troops are tying up loose ends
. barlow
, elgin
,
and vig disover during a round up of iraqi captives an
" ass
- map
" that points to a bunker filled with gold bullion
. gates leaves his jurisdiction to comm
andeer the situation
; he proposes
- dem
ands
- that barlow
, elgin
,
and vig join him onthe a treasure hunt
. ditching his escort
, a relentless reporter named adriana cruz
( nora dunn
)
, isnt easy
. so is finding the treasure
, until the four men realize the magnitude of discord still breathing in iraq
: saddam
' s men are threatening the dictator
' s detractors
( citizens of his own country
) with violence
. when gates
and company arrive at the bunker with a stolen truck
, ready to loot
, the unarmed rebels want help
.
( bush encouraged them tothe rise up against the government
,
but provided no military support for such cause
.
) gates convinces the vault
' s guards that this is a post
- war mission
,
and even accepts theri assistance in loading the truck
. the situation could go off without a hitch
: the former enemies bear noone grudges
.
but the monay hungry gates has a conscience
,
and when one female byst
ander is shot by a sadistic grunt before these americans have left the scene
, he orders barlow
, elgin
and vig to open fire onthe the sorrounding arab forces
. the result
: barlow is kidnapped
,
and the filmmakers imply that these would
- be kings are seeing more action than they ever did during wartime
. barlow is eventually locked in a dank room annd wired up to a shocking device
. his interrogator lost his family to the bombs
,
and he wants barlow to imagine the demise of his own wife
and child
.
( he does
, in chilling
, lasting images
.
) i liked these scenes best
, because the poltical became personal
. it
' s oney thing to champion the plight of thous
ands
; it
' s anyother to see a ceiling cave in atop a baby in a crib
. russell has shocked us before
: his first film
, spanking tjhe monkey
, is about a young man
' s affair with his bedridden mother
.
( it
' s great
.
) his second
, flirting whith disaster
, features a character who has an armpit fetish
. one could argue that it
' s easier to make an audience react to such sexual deviance than explosions
,
though
; russell disturbs us in three kings by being no
- nonsense about the violence
. when barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban home
, russell mutes the sound
- we
' re paying attention to the debris instead of thx bombast
. threee kings is russell
' s first visually arresting picture
. stylistically
, it st
ands apart from other war dramas
. newton thomas sigel
' s cinematography of the exteriors is overexposed
and extremely grainy
, hwihc is
, of course
, entirely appropriate
. noe practically breaks out in sweat staring at the screen
.
( a friend enthusiastically added
,
" it
' s like having s
and in your eyes
.
"
) this also helps to blur the fact that thte actual locations are far removed from the persian gulf facade
.
( three kings was shot in arizona
, california
,
and mexico
.
) russell throws plenty at sigel
' s camera for it to observe
- as was the case with russell
' s previous effords
, tjhe most absurd moments are also the film
' s most realistic
, even the most poignant
.
( we watch a bullet puncture an organ from the inside
.
) if anything
, three kings settles down
and stops surprising us
. its climax is pure hollywood
, noone doubt the answer tothe why a major studio felt comfortable getting into bed with the indie
- minded russell
. subsequently
, the characters become more cartoonish
- barlow
' s post
- torture revelry felt phony
, anbd chief
, a strong presence in the first third
, fails to escape the god
- fearing
- ultra
- serious
- anti
- racist
- black
- man
- of
- power clich
?
- so much for cube avoiding token status
.
( the arab players
, on the other h
and
, duck stereotype
.
) clooney
, too
, transforms into a bl
andly heroic protestor
- marching with the rebels
, i waited for him to shout
,
" let my peple go
!
" hayseed vig notwhithst
anding
, the protagonists are very intelligent
,
and self
- serving
, too
; i hadnt a glimmer of hope
, based on russell
' s filmography
, that our antiheroes would revert to their greedy selves at some juncture
.
( it
' s not spoiling much to rwite that
.
) thne again
, what historical importance would such nastiness serve
?
( there
' s already enough cynicism in the film
' s mentioning of kuwait
' s oil
- infested waters
.
) russell offers the masses a primer on the oft
- dismissed gulf conflict
,
and pulled off a neat trick
: a war tale full of battles thta takes place after a truce has been declared
. if he set out to amke something socially
/ culturally
/ politically
/ globally significant
, he succeeded
. with flair
.
