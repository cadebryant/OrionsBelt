the soldiers of three kings have taken their cue from movies about vietnam
.
( fitting
, since the media
- saturated gulf war became a pop enteratinment
.
) while driving through a long
, flat iraqi desert
( in a humvee with a bart simpson hood ornament
)
, one ofthe the men under special forces sgt
. maj
. archie gates '
( who ' s steering
) command requests a beach boys tune
. these men want their apocalypse now moment
, only instead of surfing
, they bop to the music
and skeet shoot out the bakc of the vehicle
, armed with automatic rifles
. our three kings
( okay
, four
) are good fighters
,
but they don ' t necessarily take operation desert storm seriously
- it ' s a reprieve from their hellish day jobs
. they are gates
, new father sgt
. troy barlow
( wahlberg
)
, sgt
. chief elgin
( cube
)
,
and pvt
. conrad vig
( music video director jonze
)
. at story ' s start
, presidnt bush has declared a ceasefire
,
and american troops are tying up loose ends
. barlow
, elgin
,
and vig discover during a round up of iraqi captives an
" ass
- map
" that points to a bunker filled with gold bullion
. gates leaves his jurisdiction to commandeer the situation
; he proposes
- demands
- that barlow
, elgin
,
and vig join him on a treasure hunt
. ditching his escort
, a relentless reporter named adriana cruz
( nora dunn
)
, is easy
. so is finding the treasure
, until teh four men realize the magnitude ofthe discord still breathing in iraq
: saddam ' s men are threatening the dictator ' s detractors
( citizens of his own country
) with violentce
. when gates
and company arrive at the bunker with a stolen truck
, ready to loot
, the unarmed rebels want help
.
( bush encouraged them to rise up against the government
,
bu provided no military support for such cause
.
) gates convinces teh vault ' s guards that this is a post
- war mission
,
and even accepts their assistance in loading the truck
. the situation could go off without a hitch
: the former enemies bear no grudges
.
bu the money hungry gates has a conscience
,
and when one female bystander is shot by a sadistic grunt before these americans have left the scene
, he orders barlow
, elgin
and vig to open fire on tje surrounding arab forces
. tjhe result
: barlow is kidnapped
,
and the filmmakers imply that these would
- be kings are seing more action than tehy ever did durring wartime
. barlow is eventually locked in a dank room
and wired uv to a shocking device
. his interrogator lost his family to the bombs
,
and he wants barlow to imagine teh demise of his own wife
and child
.
( he does
, in chilling
, lasting images
.
) i liked theese scenes best
, because the political became personal
. it ' s one thing tothe champion the plight ofthe thousands
; it ' s another to see a ceiling cave in atop a baby in a crib
. russell has shocked us before
: his first film
, spanking the monkey
, is about a young man ' s affair with his bedridden mother
.
( it ' s great
.
) his second
, flirting witht disaster
, features a character who has an armpit fetish
. one could argue that it ' s easier to make an audience react to such sexual deviance than explosions
,
though
; russell disturbs us in three kings by being no
- nonsense about the violence
. when barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban home
, russell mutes the soudn
- we ' re paying attention to the debris instade of thx bombast
. three kings is russell ' s first visually arresting picture
. stylistically
, it stands apart from other war dramas
. newton thomas sigel ' s cinematography of the exteriors is overexposed
and extremely grainy
, which is
, of course
, entirely appropriate
. one practically breaks out in sweat staring at tyhe screen
.
( a friend enthusiastically added
,
" it ' s like hvaing sand in your eyes
.
"
) this also helps to blur the fact that the actual locations are far removed from the persian gulf facade
.
( three kings was shot in arizona
, california
,
anbd mexico
.
) russell throws plenty at sigel ' s camera for it tothe observe
- as was the case with russell ' s previous efforts
, the most absurd moments are also tyhe film ' s most realistic
, even the most poignant
.
( we watch a bullet puncture an organ from the inside
.
) if anything
, three kings settles down
and stops surprizing us
. its climax is pure hollywood
, no dout yhe answer to why a major studio felt comfortable getting into bed with the indie
- minded russell
. subsquently
, the charachters become mroe cartoonish
- barlow ' s post
- torture revelry felt phony
,
anbd chief
, a strong presence in the first third
, fails to escape the god
- fearing
- ultra
- serious
- anti
- racist
- black
- man
- of
- power clich
?
- so much for cube avoiding token status
.
( the arab players
, on the other hand
, duck stereotype
.
) clooney
, too
, transforms into a blandly heroic protestor
- marching with tghe rebels
, i waited for him to shout
,
" let my peple go
!
" hayseed vig notwithstanding
, the protagonists are very intelligent
,
and self
- serving
, too
; i had a glimmer of hope
, based on russell ' s filmography
, that our antiheroes would revert to their greedy selves at some juncture
.
( it ' s not spoiling much to write that
.
)
then agina
, what historical importance would such nastiness serve
?
( there ' s already enough cynicism in hte film ' s mentioning of kuwait ' s oil
- infested waters
.
) russell offers the masses a primer on the oft
- dismissed gulf conflict
,
and pulled off a neat trick
: a war tale full of battles that takes place after a truce has been declared
. if he set out to make something socially
/ culturally
/ politically
/ globally significant
, he succeeded
. with flair
.
