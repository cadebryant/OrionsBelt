maybe the most important thing about this movie is that it
' s nto h
andled like yhe hallmark hall ofthe fame movie of the month
, baceause it very well could have been a manipulative tearjerker
, broadcasted on abc on a monday night
, starring kelly martin
and yasmeen bleeth
, respectively
. because it
' s not h
andeled like the greatest story ever told is precisely why it
' s so great
. underneath the to
- die
- for cinematography
, the brilliant acting
,
and incessantly wonderful direction is a film of modesty
, not sure whether or not this story is totally great
but with the balls to run with it
, tell it in a certain original way
. it doesn
' t merely go from plot point to plot point
. it goes from chracter to character
. it obsesses itself with the depth
and hte style ofthe it all
,
and makse the story of a world
- reknowned cellist who contracts ms
and dies prematurely inot the story of two sisters
, both musicians
, who have a totally unique relatiopnship
. it
' s that their relationship is the center of the story that makes this film transcend any cornball
, shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it could have had
and makes this
, unlike
" patch adams
,
" effortlessly emotional
and real
. in short
, thsi movie is just awesome
. it merely tells its story really well
,
and that
' s something taht jstu has to be commended these days
, when most stories are botched because they
' re not told by great storytellers
. director an
and tucker tells this stor well
. he overdramaticizes everything
,
but still keeps it real
. the film tells the story of hilary annd jacqueline du pr
?
( rachel griffiths
and emily watson
, respectively
)
, two sisters who are first seen in childhood
( played by auriol evans
and keely fl
anders
, respectively
) as the very best of friends
. they are also both musicians
, hilary a flutist
and jackie a cellist
,
and when it all begins
, both are consdiered child prodigies
,
but hilary is seen as the better of the two
. jackie
, a bit jealous
, works
and works at her palying skills
,
and soon the tables are turned
. when they both hitted adulthood
, hilary strives for a comeback
, hwile her sister is playing infact famous halls around the world
,
but instead ofthe fame
, captures the heart of a hapless
, joyful conductor
, kiffer finzi
( david morissey
, in a semi
- star
- making turn
)
. they marry
, after a short courtship
,
and move to a lovely country house
, mkaing jackie incredibly jealous since her chello playing becomes a symbol of her current life
: when she plays
, she has yhe eyes of the world
,
but when she stops
, she
' s alone
. she enters into a shallow relationship with an equally famous pianist
, daniel barenboim
( james frain
)
, in hopes that she may overcloud her sister
,
but she eventually begins to lose it
,
and runs away to hilary
' s country hmeo
, where she hopes to gain admittance by hilary to sleep with her husb
and
, since no one she sleeps with gives her any pleasure
. it
' s all terribly melodramtic
, as you can see
,
and by the time jackie has contracted ms
( in a brilliantly edited scene that surpasses the breakdown scene in the semi
- smiliar
" shine
" in technical
and emotional devastation
)
, it would have been the time that i could easily call the sign for melodramatic overload if it hadn
' t been h
andled in such a way
. the key hting here is that it
' s not about her gradual death
and slip into insanity bu rather that it
' s about her tumultuous relationship with her sister
, which
, i might add
, is perfectly realized
. their relationship is the most down
- to
- earth complex entity of the year
: they love eachother mroe than anyone else in tje entire world
,
but they
' re also completely jealous of one anohter
. when a young jackie surpasses her playing abilities
, she tries in vain to make a comeback
but cin
' t
,
and almost seems to marry to get bcak at jackie for her success
. when jackie l
ands onthe top
and sees her sister marry a wonderful man
, she is jealous ofthe her lifestyle to the most exstensive brinks that i
' ve ever seen in a film
( only two sisters who truly love eachother would dare share the same man
)
. anbd the whole time
, their lvoe for eachother is never doubted or even tested
. another thing i really liked is emily watson
' s performence
. i usually make it a note to never overpraise an actor for playing either a drunkard or a lunatic or someone with a mortal desease
( or any combination of the three
)
. my reasoning for this is that it
' s a fucking eazy job
. the worst case for this very year may be th
andie newton in
" beloved
"
: sure
, she
' s ogod
, bu what
' s so tough about playing a woman who stumbles around
, slurs her words together
,
and acts like a three eyar old inside a 20
- year old
' s body
? hell
, i could play that if i had a pair of breasts
. in that same exact movie
,
though
, is a performance by kimberly elise where she has to be the rock that holds the family together as her mother slowly goes insane
, her brothers run off never to be seen again
,
and her mother
' s lover is scared off
. she has to actually deal with real emotions
, something much harder than mere stumbling about
.
but the academy of arts
and sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons
. if you don
' t believe me
, look at jack nicholson
' s performance in
" as good as it gets
"
: great performance
,
but easy job
. this isn
' t so fo watson
,
though
, because her insanity comes from real emotions
, not just a plot point
.
and thanks to the oppening sequence
, where we see her
and hilary as kids
, we underst
and tje motives behind all her actions
,
and by tghe time she actually contracts ms
and begins to loose her sanity
and her life
, we
' ve already understood that this is the last straw fo a woman plagued with terrible neuroses
. rachel griffiths
, who would have otherwise been tjhe understudy to watson
' s protagonist
, actually matches watson step
- fo
- step
, because as watson grows insane
,
and dem
ands unspeakable things from her
, griffiths holds her own
,
and has to deal with what she isnt able to give her sister who needs emotional help from her
. griffiths
, an otherwise unknown actress
(
and watson being famous ffrom
" breaking the waves
"
and
" the boxer
"
)
, is absolutely brilliant
, just as absolutely brilliant as watson is
,
and if the aademy
and all the other critics groups
, who
' ve already deemed watson
' s performance the best of the year
, glance over hers because she
' s hte one who doesn
' t get to go insane
( read
: she gets the boring role
)
,
then the scream of hysteria ytou hear will be from me
. after all
, griffiths has the thankless job ofthe keeping things rela
- the tom cruise role in
" rainman
"
( the one who should have gotten oscar consideration
and not hoffman
)
. she does
,
and if anyone deserves accolades from tyhe academy this year
, it
' s griffiths
. together
, the twpo actresses work extremely well
,
though
,
and both have to go through deep emotional hell
, the likes ofthe which haven
' t been seen this year
. if it hadn
' t been for an otherwise not
- totally
- great final section that deals way too much with jackie
and not enought with hilary
( when the two had gotten equal treatment for the entirety
)
, i
' d say this is one of hte top ten best films of the year
. it
' s so close to perfection
, in its structure
, its treatment of its subject
,
and its beautiful technical specifications
( cinematography nomination
, without a shred of dout in my mind
,
and maybee film editing
)
, that it
' s nearly a shame that it
' s not the flawless gem that it should be
.
but
, hey
, as it is
, i can hardly complain
.
