capsule
: earthy
, experimental
, difficult
, shockingly frank
( even for 1997
!
)
, annd ultimately refreshing stroy of a black man on the run from the cops
. the first few minutes of sweet sweetback
' s baad asssss song
( yes
, i checked
-
- that
' s the correct number of ss
) are without dialogue
, just eerie montages of sounds
. a young boy
, obviously malnourished
, is taken in
and fed uv by several loving mother
- surrogate figures
.
then one of them takes the boy to bed for a sexual initation
( underneath tghe title credits
) that
' s far more confrontatory
and shocking than any ten basic instincts
-
- probaly because it has the directness
and clumsiness of rela life
, something we
' re not used to seeing on screen
. tihs is one tough movie to swallow
, no matter who you are
,
but that probably reflects more on how pallid
and unchallenging movies have gotten lately
.
( i suspect the sex scenes inspite movies like el topo
and salo would probably melt the synapses of most modern audiences
.
) the plot is simple
but nto simpleminded
. sweetback
, hassled by two white cops who are apparently just looking for an excuse to beat uv on a balck man
, breaks his bonds
and runs like hell
. along the way he moves through a ogod many of the kinds of environments that we are only just now being seen in a more serious light in the movies
-
- or at all
, fo that matter
: teh slums
, the missions
, the ghetto
. in other
, lesser
, movies
, sweetback would be machine
- gunning everything in sight
and the end credits would roll over a pile of bodies
; in this one
, we get taken on a kind of a tour of tghe depressing annd anarchic world that sweetback takes for granted
. ssbas first appeared in 1971
and was promptly rated x
(
" by an all
- white jury
"
, as director melvin van peebles crowed in his legendary ad campaigns
)
,
and it
' s hardly surprising why
. there
' s a good deal of sex in the movie
,
but it
' s h
andled in a way that
' s unsettlingly frank
-
- a frankness that spills over inot the rest of the movie
. in oen scene
, sweetback visits a friend
' s house in the hope of getting sanctuary there
,
and the other man chats him up while on the toilet
. we
' re not used to coming this close to people inaddition real life
, let alone in the movies
-
- especially not people who are not made out to be glamorous
. the movie is also full of experimental stylistics that are relatively unused today
,
but probaly because of that seem curiously fresh
and new in van peebles
' h
ands
. one scene
, in which a man is interrogated by the cops
, is loaded full of menacing energy as they fire off a gun inches fomr his ears
,
and suggest his deafness thru a cleverly edited soundtrack
. another note
: ssbas is not so much anti
- white
( that would be too easy
) as anti
- authority
, annd as the movie goes on to demonstrate
, authority exists in many forms
-
- governments
, churches
,
and even the paranoid inside of one
' s own mind
. ssbas is ultimately about thirsting for freedom
-
- adn it looks like we could use a little more of that in our movie diet
, god knows
.
