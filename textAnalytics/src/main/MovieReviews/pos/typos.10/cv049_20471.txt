. rated r for sci
- fi voilence
. starring
: keanu reeves
, laurence fishburne
, joe panteliano some may be disappointed wih the matrix
. i
' ll tell you i was
. i sat there
and sat there
and sat there waiting for something to happen
. now wait wait
, i know most of you loved it
,
and i
' m not saying i didn
' t like it
. what i
' m saying is the first half was extremely slow
. now seeing the trailer it makes you thikn the whole entire movie is one big speical effects show
. don
' t be fooled
, this movie has a big story
. annd big chunks of talky moments
.
but i will admit yhe special effects
and the acting were above par
, deserving tyhe rating above
. ok now to the story
. well this may tkae a hwile
. ok first ofthe all
, our world we live in now
, is not the real world
, actually we live inside a coputer generated world known as the matrix
. a man played by keanu reeves is about to find that out
, when is kidnapped
and almost coaxed to go into the real world
. he does so
,
and finds out taht he can do anything
, be anything he wants to be
.
but he has to fight a
' matrix skipping
' bad guy
, who wants to send him back to his own world or destroy him
. laurence fishburne
, his guide of sorts plays his character well as does keanu reeves
.
but i sat infront the theatre for over
and hour wondering where all the special effects were
. yeah there were some in the first half
but nto enough
. the trailer for this movie was really decieving making people think that tihs was a special effects laden movie
. now for the second half
, it is explosive
,
and saves the movei
. some ofthe the special effects
and fighting were breathtaking
. tyhe sound
, the music
,
and all the effects weere effective
,
and the last hour kept us entertained
.
but with a running time of 2 hours
and 20 minutes
, tihs movie isnt at least 40 minutes too long
. one would have wished fo a better
' matrix
'
,
but i do hve to say
, i did like it
and i was entertained
.
