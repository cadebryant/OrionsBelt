inaddition the gr
and scheme of mel gibson movies
, payback was better thna conspiracy theory
,
but not as good as braveheart or lethal weapon
. inspite other words
, it
' s a decent couple ofthe hours of entertainment
,
but 20 years from now if a they compile a list of mel gibson
' s greatest hits
, payback probably won
' t be on it
. gibson plays a crook who gets double crossed by his partner after they heist a payroll
. mel
' s partner needed the money tothe pay off a mob debt
. so he puts a couple of bullets in mel
, leaving him forthe dead
,
and goes on tothe pay off his creditors
. bu
, mel isn
' t dead
( it would be a real short movie if he was
)
and he certainly isn
' t happy
. to make matters worse
, he wants his money back
and is willing to go to any lengths to accomplish this feat
. his ex partner has already used it to pay off the mobsters
, so mel goes after the mob to get it back
. payback is often a very voilent film
. to its credit
, there are a few scenes that could have been very graphic
,
but the director
( i
' m not sure which one
-
- more about that inthe a second
) made the choice to let thge audience use their imagination instead of subjecting us to the usual gratuitious gore found in many films
. the film appears a bit disjointed in places
, which is underst
andable considering producer
/ star gibson wasn
' t thrilled with how the film turned out
and wanted parts of it re
- shot
. when the director refused
, another one was brought in tothe do the re
- shoot
. so as a result while the final product is apparently better than the original
( altho personally i would loev to see tje original version for comparisons sake
) it doesnt get a bit of a choppy feel to it towards the end
. it
' s always tough tothe make a film where the main character is a villain
, unless that person hasnt some redeeming qualities
. in tihs case
, gibson
' s character has few redeeming qualities
.
but hey
, its mel
, so even when he is killing people inspite cold blood we are still rooting for him
. my guess is thast if that you put some other johnny bananas actor in this role
, the audience woudl not be quite as responsive
. gibson is gibson
, whether he is playing a suicidal cop or a stone cold killer
, he does a good job
. he almost guarantees thta no matter what else happens inaddition the rest of the movie at least the audience is going to get one good performance
. this time out mel isnt surrounded by a ogod supporting cast
, including maria bello
( as his love interst
)
, william devane adn kris kristofferson
( as mod bosses
)
. the man who steals thge show
and unfortunately doesn
' t hve a real big part is james coburn
( as
yet another mobster
)
. if i had one big disappointment in this film
, it would be that coburn didn
' t have a bigger role
. in the end
, payback is a fairly solid action thriller
, jsut not in quite the same league as some ofthe mel gibson
' s other work
.
