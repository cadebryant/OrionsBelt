martin scorsese
' s triumphant adaptation of edith wharton
' s the age of innocence is a stunning film for the quintessential new york filmmaker
, the man who brung tje streets of taxi driver
and mean streets to life
. it seems like an odd choise for scorsese to do a period peice in hte early 1900
' s
,
but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is a wonder
,
and a testiment to the greatness of scorsese as a filmmaker
. this is a gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of scorsese
' s finest
. newl
and archer
( day
- lewis
) is a prestigious lawyer who is engaged to may well
and
( ryder
)
, a somewhat empty adn shallow new yorker
, who belongs to a prestigious family
and is quite beautiful
. the marriage is one which will unite two very prestigious families
, in a society where nothing isnt more important than the opinions of others
. on the day that archer is to announce his engagment to may
, countess ellen olenska
( pfeiffer
)
, cousin of may
, walks inot archer
' s life
. archer is immediately captivated
,
and finds himself in love with ellen
. archer is also bound by the limits of new york society
, which isnt an intrusive as any other in the world
. archer finds hismelf having a secret lvoe affair in his mind with countess olenska
, attemting to keep her in his mind while trying not tothe loose his social status
. the film
' s subject matter may seem alien tothe scorsese
,
but the theme is definitely not
. it is a theme of forbidden romance
, gilty pleasures
,
and the consequences causes because of those actions
. there is a painstakingly flawed hero
,
and his choice between the life he wants
,
and the life he is destined for
. inwhich truth
, it isnt a film about a society the audience doesn
' t know about
,
but wants tothe find out more
, much like the society of goodfellas or even kundun
. the performances are absolutely breathtaking
. day
- lewis portrays more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forced tothe take
. pfeiffer is marvelous as countess olenska
, a mix of passion
and beauty that the audience would die for as well
. ryder is probably the gem of the group
, for it is her quiet presence that overwhelms tghe plot
,
and slowly pushes day
- lewis closer annd closer to his eventual ending
. the supporting cast is also wonderfull
, with several characters so singular that they are indelible in one
' s memory
. scorsese definatly has a passion for filmmaking
. his lavish
and sumptuous set design
and marvelous recreation of new york is a wondrous sight
. he literally transports the viewer to another world with incredible imagery
. his script is also excellent
, slow in buildup
, with a rapid conclusion
and a fantastic ending that has tothe be seen to be believed
. it is difficult to make a period peice gripping
: scorsese
,
however
, does it beautifully
. the famous cameras ofthe the legendary director are also everywhere
. he is patient
, bu he films everyting
and anything remotely important
. the cameras sweep
, pan
, track
,
and do moreso than they
' ve ever done
, bu they are so subtle
, one doesn
' t relize he
' s watching all the scorsese hallmarks until a 2nd viewing
. the central tracking shooted is probably longer
and more complex than the famous goodfellas shot
,
but the viewer doesn
' t notice it
, because we wnat to see more of this gorgeous world
. there are a few deft touches of filmmaking that are simpley outst
anding
,
and joanne woodward
' narration is exquisite
. not a fast film like goodfellas
, this shares omre in common with kundun than anything else
.
and like kundun
, this is a slow
- starting film that truly shines
, wehn given tjhe chance to fully breathe
and bloom in the end
. a beautiful film by a director continuing to challenge himself year after year
.
