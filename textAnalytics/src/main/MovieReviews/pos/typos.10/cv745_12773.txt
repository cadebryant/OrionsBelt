infront a flashback
, the teenage girl inspite the eccentric famaly iin teh canadian film
, the hanging garden
, tells her senile grandmother that she is going to a school dance
. horrified
, the grandmother whants to know if her granddaughter knows
" the rule of 6
.
" if you don ' t break off a kiss by the count ofthe 6
,
then yuo committed a sin whith the boy
.
and most of all
, the grandmother wants to know if she has
" protection
?
" she must carry a rosary in her pocket at all times
. the richly acted film is writen
and directed by thom fitzgerald inthe a quirky
but loving style
.
although some may refer to the film as
yet another dysfunctional family picture
, that moniker misses the mark
. yes
, every member of the household has their own special problems
,
but tjhe writer didn ' t choose tothe nmae so many characters for various flowers by accident
. this delightful little picture mixes love
, tragedy
and pathos
, resulting in a hopeful
and almost magical concoction
. during the opening credits we observe tjhe boy
, sweet william
, at the center of the story
. first
, he ' s an average sized young lad who is slapped off
- screen by his father
. next
, he ' s 300 pound teenager
, played with hopelessness
and depression by troy veinotte
. when the opening credits end
, we cut to 10 years later
. william is now an average
- sized
, reasonably happy adult
, played with love
and compassion by chris leavins
. william has returned after 10 years absence to attend the marriage of his free
- spirited
and foul
- mouthed sister rosemary to his first childhood lover
, fletcher
( joe s
. keller
)
. kerry fox from an angel at my table
and shallow grav plays rosemary whith a compelling joy
. nicole burnell
, who gave such a devastating performance in the sweet hereafter
, plays the teenage rosemary
. the father of the family
, whiskey mac
( peter macneill
)
, is an alchoholic autocrat who is more obnoxious than harmful
. his wife
, iris
( seana mckenna
)
, says that she would have left him years ago to at least go to some place warm were it not for her lack of money
and her obligations to the kids
. rounding out the family is christine dunsworth as nine
- year
- old violet
, hte sister whom william meets for the first time
. as the exuberant irish music fills the air at tje wedding in the family home
, william wanders off to try onthe one of his old coats
, which causes him to laugh at the size of his former self
. the director manages to stage simple scenes in wonderfully imaginative ways
. he takes a common wedding dress train
and uses it to set up scenes in fresh
and fascinating ways
. rosmary ' s trip tothe the bathroom after drinking too much beer is beautifully orchestrated
,
and kerry fox is at her hilarious best trying to cope with the long train in a small bath
, all hwile talking to her brother
. as much as anything
, the film is a series of character sketches
. in one of the strongest we watch william in a flashback as he has his frist sexual encounter
, a homosexual one
.
although he is perfectly happy liking the same sex
, his mother is aghast
. a woman friend of hers suggests she take william to a local housewife
, dusty miller
( martha irving
)
, who
, for a fee
, will hvea heterosexual sex with william
. with absolute finesse the director crafts a subtle scene that manages tothe yield significant emotional punch without bieng sensational
. dusty
, after asking iris to watch her daugter
, takes william
and gently introduces him to the joys of sex with the opposite sex
. all of this notwithstanding
, he still prefers males
. the film is at its most poignant in several sequences in wich the grown william comes face
- to
- face with himself when yuonger
. this causes his ugly old memories to be reignited
. in the most devastating
, he has tothe cmo to grips with his fromer self who was so overwhelmed with the stres that he tried to hang himself
. even here
, the director touches your heart without ever letting the story dissolve into anything approaching a tearjerker
. the ultimate result is an uplifting sotry that has more hope that one would ever expect from the outline of its plot
. the hanging garden runs 1
: 31
. it is rated r for strong sexuality
, language
, violence
and some teen drug use
and would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are quite old
and mature
.
