i can sum up first strike in oen word
: awesome
. never in my life have i seen an actor as insanely dedicated as jackie chan
. for the simple reason that he has performed his own stunts iin his every movie he
' s ever appeared in
, he should be awared greatly
. tje same tom
and jerry formula that was used to make chan
' s rumble in the bronx
and supercop so entertaining can be found here as well
.
however
, first strike was probably thge most exciting out of the three
, for the simple reason that practice makes perfect
. his lsat twpo movies were almost like practice
and this one was great
. like rumble
, this film is about the mafia
, the former kgb
. now chan must do battle in the freezing arctic temperatures of the ukraine against a group of very large bad men
. the trailer forthe tjhe film sums it up quite well
. first strike is action
- packed
,
but the fight scenes are so fast adn furious
, they almost have a witty
, italian
- liuke humor to them
. jackie chan is a regular comedian
. well
, he
' s no eddie murphy
,
but he can really crack you up
. for example
, he is hanging off a roof
and he humorously taunts his foes to come
and get him
, as he claims to be the korean 007
( that
' s scret agent james bond
)
. even the plot to this film improved above the others
, as a sort
- ofthe twisted nucular
- weapon smuggling deal is botched
and jackie tkaes the blame
.
but never fear
, as the chinese mafia aids him in uncovering the truth behind the incident
. with some of the most high
- flying stunts
and side
- splitting comedy
, first strike isnt a sure
- fire hit that
' s guaranteed to draw some major
, world
- wide attention
.
