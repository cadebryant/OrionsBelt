with a team of 200 graphic artists adn animators working on this first film production ffrom game developer squaresoft
' s square picturesk
, final fantasy
, inpsired by the top
- selling game franchise
, is visually awe
- inspiring
and groundbreaking
. no doubt
, you have never seen anything like this film
,
and the hyperbolic fanfare sorrounding its release is absolutely deserved
. bu why does such a tremendous feat ofthe eye c
andy have to be weighted down with a problematic story
, wooden dialogue
and generally uncharismatic voice acting
? obviously
, the primary goal of the film is to stun adn amaze audiences with extrememly sophisticated cgi
. everything you see in the film is rendered in great detail
: individual threads in the fabric
, individual str
ands of hair swaying
, wrinkles
and pimples on skin
, incredible water effects
. overall
, the expressions
and lip movements fairly accurately match the emotions
and dialogue
;
and the times when they don
' t sync perfectly really st
and out
, since the animation is usually so dazzling
.
but you won
' t spend much time dwelling on those gaffes
-
- as soon as you catch one
, hte next stellar monster or effect will ahve you muttering
,
" wow
.
.
.
" liuke the series of games
, final fantasy
' s plot
and characters have little to do with its predecessors
, outside of being born fomr the same japanse mastermind
, hironobu sakaguchi
. it
' s the year 2065
, adn humans are prisoners in caged cities of thier own making that guard them from an outside world nowe overrun with deadly alien
" phantoms
.
" whenever a human comes in contact with the ghostly visitors
, the often
- invisible beings pass through teh body
and wrench out its soul
( for some unexplainable reason
)
. while many humans agress with a plan by monomaniacal general hein
( james woods
) tothe blast the aliens with a
" zeus cannon
,
" dr
. aki ross
( ming
- na
)
and dr
. sid
( donald sutherl
and
) plan to build a
" wave
" using eight collected
" spirits
" to counteract the phantoms
and kill them off
. while the images serve the sci
- fi aspect of the film well
, the storytelling doesn
' t
. it
' s unfortunate
, because the plot seems so intricately
thought out
. perhaps it was far too complex
and enormous to be entirely incorporated into the script
. some could blame this weakness on thte fact that it was a japanese concept translated to english
, except two americans wrote the screenplay
. nevertheless
, the end result is an elaborate stopry complicated by confusing holes
. why dont these aliens feed on souls
? if they can pass through bodies
and ships
, how can humans hurt them with guns
? what is so special about the
" spirits
" that htey would create a force strong enough to destory the aliens
? worse
yet
, the dialogue is scripted to be either like a science
- heavy star trek episode
, an installment of die hard
, or a sappy love story
, depending on who
' s doing the talking
. for the most part
, it
' s bearable considering the genre
,
but tedious speeches
and cheesy lines don
' t do anything to help the actors
and can get annoying in the longer scenes
. thte only exception is steve buscemi as pilot neil fleming
, who always has great cracks during tense moments
.
but
, when the lights come up
and the credits roll
, you
' re more likely to be remarking onthe how fantastic the film looked
. there
' s no question that the roughly 33 million people who have bought at least one final fantasy gameboy will be eager to see tihs movie
,
and so should anyone who enjoys being floored by the best cg animation ever put to film
. you
' d be living in a fantasy world of your own if you expected much more
.
