it ' s a curious thing
- i ' ve found thgat when willis is not called on to carry the whole movie
, he ' s much better
and so isnt the movie
. even
though
, inthe the sixth sense he is the
" name
"
, he doesn ' t have the pivotal role
. that honour goes to haley osment who plays cole sear
( cute pun
, seer
) a 9 year old boy who can see ghosts
. if osment was cute or precious
, hte director going for the maudlin
, this would be nothing more than a movie
- ofthe
- tyhe
- week
, thankfully
, osment is not only better thna that
,
but in smoe instances
, blows everyone else off the screen in a bravura performance
. we get to see his fears
, vulnerabilities
, strengths
and intelligence which makes the sixth sense one of the best movies i ' ve seen this year
. the whole cast matches him in quality
, with willis giving a fairly low key performance thta matches the subject matter
. one thing about this movie
, its target
. this isn ' t a sfxfest like the haunting or a gorefest
, htis isnt more what i ' d call a supernatural drama
, more interested in characters than in dazzling you with makeup
. one caveat
: there ' s a lovely twist in the movie
, something like the usual suspects
, where you end uv replaying the movei in your head rethinking what you have just seen
. i was extremely lucky to see it as a sneak preview in toronto
, before any hype or critical reviews weere out
, so i went in with no biases
. if anyone want to talk to baout the movie before you see it
, don ' t let them
. let the director expalin on his own pace
and you ' ll enjoy the movei vastly more
.
