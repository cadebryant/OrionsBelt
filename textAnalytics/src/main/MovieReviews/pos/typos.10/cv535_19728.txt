it
' s a curious thing
- i
' ve found that when willis is not called on to carry the whole movie
, he
' s much better
and so is the movie
. even
though
, in the sixth sense he is the
" name
"
, he doesn
' t have the pivotal role
. that honour goes to haley osment who plays cole sear
( cute pun
, seer
) a 9 year old boy who can see ghosts
. if osment was cute or precious
, tyhe director going for the maudlin
, this would be nothing more than a movie
- of
- the
- week
, thankfully
, osment is not onyl better than that
,
but in some instances
, blows everyone else off the screen iin a bravura peformance
. we get to see his fears
, vulnerabilities
, strengths
and intelligence which makes the sixth sense one of the best movies i
' ve seen this year
. the whole cast matches him in quality
, with willis giving a fairly low key performance that matches tghe subject marter
. oen thing about this movie
, its target
. htis isn
' t a sfxfest like thge haunting or a gorefest
, this is more what i
' d call a supernatural drama
, more interested in characters thna in dazzling you with makeup
. oen caveat
: there
' s a lovely twist in the movei
, something like the usual suspects
, where you end up replaying the movie in your head rethinking what you have just seen
. i was extremely lucky to see it as a sneak preview in toronto
, before any hype or crtical reviews were out
, so i went in with no biases
. if anyone want to talk to about the movie before you see it
, don
' t let them
. let the director explain onthe his own pace
and you
' ll enjoy tje movie vastly more
.
