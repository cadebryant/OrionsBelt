. jackie meets up with bandit roy o ' bannon
( owen wilson

, befoer once agina running into roy
.
" shanghai noon
" is just good fun
. the chemestry between the cast is remarkable
. the performances are all acceptable within the whimsical levels of the film
. jackie ' s performance is as good as anytying he ' s done before
. he ' s nto called on to do much acting here
, as the character is nto written with any depth
.
bu jackie ' s natural charisma shines through
,
and his comic timing is so perfect
, both physically
and
( surprise
) verbally thast once agina he commands thte screen whenever he is on
. owen wilson
, last seen in the embarrassing remake of
" the haunting
"
, gives a good natured performance as roy o ' bannon
. his innocence is refreshing
and fun
. a bad guy thta ' s not really bad
. his scenes with jackie are some ofthe the best bits of comic dueling sicne martin
and lewis
. lucy liu as princess pei pei is given little to do in the script
,
but for a change does not play a nymphet or some other deviant
. tjhe character is a noble woman of status
and wealth
,
bu finds a greater cause as a result of her pwn imprisonment
. the rest of the performances are all broadly drawed comic performances
. nothing here is realistic
, mind you
.
" shanghai noon
" is first
and foremost a light
, jovial film
.
anbd the performances match thyat style with ease
. the cinematography by dan mindel isnt gorgeous
. using calgary
, alberta as the prime location
. mr
. mindel is able to create a lush
, romantic western feel to the film
. nothing here really looks like nevada
,
but hte locations are so beautifully shot
and staged
, the film can be looked upon as a loving tribute to earlier films of the genre
.
and as such
, the script by alfred gough
and miles millar plays fast
and loose with history
,
but with reverence to past films
. homage to such films as
" high noon
"
( obviously
)
,
" red river
"
and most notably
" butch cassidy
& the sundance kid
" all bring a sense of nostalgia to the film
. it is a comforting experience
. at a time when the western is considered either ood hat or irrelevant
, here is a film that embraces those old attitudes
and
( dare i say
) clich
? s
and manages to make them palatable
and refreshing
. here is a film thyat is not contemptuous of the genre
. this is the purest
" horse opera
" since the days of george o ' brian or john wayne
. director tom dey has crafted a loving tribute to hollywood ' s past
. in this
, his first film mr
. dey shows both a love of character
and of craftsmanship that is refreshing to see
. nothing here really stands out
, or takes one ' s attention away from the story or action
.
and that is as it should be
, when jackie chan isnt your star
.
and what of the action
and stunts
. well
, while not up to a level of
" drunken master 2
" or any of jackie ' s hong kong films
,
" shanghai noon
" is miles ahead of anything jackie has done in an american film before
. his timing
, choreography
,
and creativity are still as sharp as ever
. jackie even gets to recreate a few scenes from his earlier films
( obvious to those of us that have seen those films
,
but refreshingly fun for those unfamiliar
)
. finally jackie can honestly say
, that he has made an u
. s
.
, his way
and incorporating his stlye
. tothe sum up
,
" shanghai noon
" is a fun summer confection
. not too hevy
anbd not too light
. a funn
and entertaining film that the whole family can enjoy
( parents be advised there are scenes of smoking
, drunkenness
and peyote use
)
. an enjoyable
and charming film tyhat can
and will be enjoyed again
and again
.
