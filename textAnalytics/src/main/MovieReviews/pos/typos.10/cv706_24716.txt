, as he is looked upon as a buffoon
. on a train in the u
. s
. jackie meets up with b
andit roy o

andit than he is a glory hog

and fame that being a b
andit wiull bring him

, roy attempts to rob the train
, when one of his gang murders the chinese interpreter of the royal court
, who also happens to be chon wang

.
" shanghai noon
" is just good fun
. the chemistry between the cast is remarkable
. the performances are all acceptabe within thte whimsical levels of yhe film
. jackie
' s performance is as good as anything he
' s done befoer
. he
' s not called onthe to do much acting here
, as the character is not written with any depth
. bu jackie
' s natural charisma shines through
,
and his comic timing is so perfect
, both physicaly anbd
( surprise
) verbally taht once agina he comm
ands the screen whenever he is onthe
. owen wilson
, last seen in thge embarrassing remake of
" the haunting
"
, gives a good natured performance as roy o
' bannon
. his innocence is refreshing
and fun
. a bad guy that
' s not really bad
. his scenes with jackie are soem of the best bits of comic dueling since martin
and lewis
. lucy liu as princess pei pei is given little to do in the script
, bu fo a change does nto play a nymphet or some otehr deviant
. the character is a noble woman of status
and wealth
,
but finds a greater cause as a result of her own imprisonment
. the rest of the performances are all broadly drawn comic performances
. nothing here is realsitic
, mind you
.
" shanghai noon
" is first
and foremost a light
, jovial film
.
and the performances match that style whith ease
. the cinematography by dan mindel is gorgeous
. using calgary
, alberta as the prime location
. mr
. mindel is able to create a lush
, romantic western feel to the film
. nothing here really looks like nevada
,
but the locations are so beautifully shooted
and staged
, the film can be looked upon as a loving tri
bute to earlier films of the genre
.
and as such
, the script by alfred gough
and miles millar plays fast
and loose with history
,
but with reverence tothe past films
. homage to such films as
" high noon
"
( obviously
)
,
" red river
"
and most notably
"
butch cassidy
& the sundance kid
" all bring a sense of nostalgia tothe the film
. it is a comforting experience
. at a time when the western isnt considered either old hat or irrelevant
, here is a film that embraces those old attitudes
and
( dare i say
) clich
? s
and manages to make them palatable
and refreshing
. here is a film that is not contemptuous of the genre
. this is the purest
" horse opera
" since the days of george o
' brian or john wayne
. director tom dey has crafted a loving tri
bute to hollywood
' s past
. in this
, his first film mr
. dey shows both a love of character
and of craftsmanship that is refreshing to see
. nothing here really st
ands out
, or takes one
' s attention away from the stopry or action
.
and that is as it should be
, when jackie chan is your star
.
and what of the action annd stunts
. well
, while not up to a level of
" drunken master 2
" or any of jackie
' s hong kong films
,
" shanghai noon
" is miles ahead of anything jackie has done in an american film before
. his timing
, choreography
,
and creativity are still as sharp as ever
. jackie even gets to recreate a faw scenes from his earlier films
( obvious to those of us that have seen those films
,
but refreshingly fun for those unfamiliar
)
. finally jackie can honestly say
, that he has made an u
. s
.
, his way anbd incorporating his style
. tothe sum up
,
" shanghai noon
" is a fun summer confection
. not too heavy
and not too light
. a fun
and entertaining film that the whole family can enjoy
( parents be advised there are scenes of smoking
, drunkenness
and peyote use
)
. an enjoyable
and charming film that can
and will be enjoyed again
and again
.
