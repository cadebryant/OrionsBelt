" you
' ve got mail
" isnt the very defnition of a
" cute
" movie
. it
' s got cute stars
, a cute story
- line
,
and even cute pets
. despite this over
- whelming cuteness
( or maybe because ofthe it
)
, i loved
" you
' ve got mail
"
. i know
, i know
. i
' m supposed tothe be a film criteak
. i
' m not supposed to lveo transparent
and forumla pictures like this
.
but darn it
, somewhere along the way
,
" you
' ve got mail
" reeled me in
, hook
, line
,
and sinker
. the movie stars tom hanks
and meg ryan as two somewhat unahppy new yorkers who meet in an aol online chat room
and quickly become close friends
, without ever knowing each others identity
. as the movie progresses
,
though
, they begin to discover that they have a lot in common with each otehr
. meanwhile
, in
" rela
- life
"
, they are bitter competitors
. she owns a quaint little children
' s bookstore
, he owns one of those gigantic super
- bookstores that offer impersonal sevice
and discount prices
. while his store threatens to run her store out of business
, their online relationship grows stronger
.
" you
' ve got mail
" is as artificial as movies cmo
. everyting is nice
and happy
and by the end
, all the characters have gotten exactly what they wanted out of life
. htere are no real conflicts
, no major disappointments
, no unresolved issues
. nevertheless
, i quite enjoyed it
. in fact
, i can
' t remember the last time i had such a good timne at the movies
. i think sometimes you have to be able to watch a movie
and just get drawn into it
. the fact that stars hank
and ryan are at teh top of their game does not hurt either
. in particular
, hanks is at his best here
, turning his
" charm
- meter
" up to 11
. everytime he was on screen
, he hadnt my full attention
.
and despite the fatc that he was driving little bookstores outloud of business
, i was rooting for him
. it was good to see hanks back doing whta he does best
: playing teh affable everyman
.
" you
' ve got mail
" certainly won
' t be winning any awards
,
but as an exercise in pure entertainment
, it
' s as ogod as it gets
.
