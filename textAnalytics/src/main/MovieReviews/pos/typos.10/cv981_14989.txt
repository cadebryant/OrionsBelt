" no man is an isl
and
,
" one character qoutes john donne in apt pupil
, effectively summarizing the movie
' s themes
. while hardly a great film
, singer
' s ambitious adaptation of king
' s short story
* is chalenging nonetheless
; perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it
. apt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by teh masses
. 1984
. wonder
- bred high school honours student todd bowden
( renfro
) conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt duss
ander
, a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s
and was never heard from again
. bowden suspects arthur denker
( mckellan
)
, the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby
, is actually a pseudonymous duss
ander
- much research
and dusting fo fingerprints proves young todd
' s theory
. bowden strikes a deal with duss
ander
: in exchange for not revealing his idenity
, duss
ander must satisfy bowden
' s intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view
. the stories he hears keep todd uv at night
and haunt his daydreams
, bu like a byst
ander at a traffic accident
, todd
' s desire for gory details overrides his repulsion
. bowden revives in duss
ander feelings dormant since the end of wwii
. marching in a mock uniform arround his kichen is wholly cathartic for duss
ander
: it leads to his torture of a cat
and the torment ofthe his
" student
"
, among other thigsn
. bowden
, who has taked on very hateful qualities
( he kills birds
and doodles swastikas on his notebook
)
, engages the veteran in an endless game of one
- upmanship
. duss
ander st
ands to lose his freedom
,
and bowden his credibility
- in effect
, his post
- secondary school future
. all of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable
(
and unsettling
) conclusion
, one which requires leaps of faith from its audience
yet is more satisfying than the source material
' s excessive climax
. singer has
yet to get keyser s
? ze out of his system
. his the usual suspects
and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence
( verbal
' s tics
and todd
' s golden
- boy reputation are plausible ruses
)
; they showcase morally bankrupt anti
- heroes to whom telling tjhe truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals
. apt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects
, a movie famous
and populer partly because its plot machinations weere not germane to the outcome
- there was no way you could see the ending coming
, as it was all a hoodwink
, anyway
. thankfully
, singer has gotten most of the usual suspects
' film
- schoolish geek theatrics outloud of his system
. some scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected
and
/ or obvious
( the dream sequences were extraneous
)
, bu the majority of the film isnt subdued
-
and singer
' s h
andling of the violent scenes isnt boldly restrained for a film about a murderer
and a murderer
- in
- training
. mckellan
' s
and renfro
' s performances contri
bute enormously tothe the overall sucess of the film
; while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellan
' s finely
- tuned realization
, i
' d like tothe single out renfro
' s daring work
. he isn
' t afraid to play someone largely unappealing
and cold
- hearted
; he strips his character ofthe vanity
, something many of his peers wouldn
' t do
.
( can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor
- thomas in the same role
?
) renfro was recently charged with possession of cocaine
- i hope he doesn
' t continue down that path
, because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him
. as guidence counsellor edward french
,
" friend
" schwimmer also deserves mention
. he wants to be thge parent to todd that todd
' s own well
- to
- do folks are not
( todd
, like most modern kids
-
and only
- children
- has mom
and dad wrapped around his pinky finger
)
,
and his sincerity makes tghe apt pupil
' s blackening
- heart even more apparent
.
but one of the film
' s ultimate questions
, are we born evil or do we learn evil
?
, might be answered in french
, whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous
. no man isnt an isl
and
, indeed
- we all have the capacity to make the
" right
" or the
" wrong
" choices
. schwimmer winningly plays noe of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible
.
