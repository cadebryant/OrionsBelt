there ' s a thin line between satire
and controversy
,
and mike nichols
( the birdcage
, wolf
) has directed a sharp
and very honest look at a us presidential election
. based onthe teh book written by
" anonymous
"
( actually former
" newsweek
" writer joe klein
)
, john travolta plays governor jack stanton
.
but he doesn ' t atually play stanton
. he plays bill clinton
; just the same as emma thompson no doubt plays the first lady
annd billy bob thorton is the campaign manipulator james carville
(
although the credits will of course sday otherwise
)
. the film is taken from the perspective of henry burton
( adrian lester
)
, a morally correct
and somewhat hesitant new advisor to stanton
. he searches for justice
and dignity in the ugliest possible situations
,
and whether it be keeping the hitsory of his boss ' pants under wraps or contemplating digging up dirt on another politician
, he approaches his work with a keen desire to skillfully serve his ocuntry
and his fellow workers
. richard jemmons
( billy bob thorton
)
and daisy gren
( maura tierney
) team up with henry as the would
- be president ' s advisors
,
and hire lesbian veteran libby holden
( kathy bates
) as the campaign ' s eccentric
" tougher than dirt
" incriminator
. together they face all sorts of sexual allegations
, the irritatingly discourteous media
and other witty politicians in the election race
. in its satire
and controversy
, primary colors is a similar film to wag the dog
: they both are not afraid to wipe their noses in the nitty
- gritty
and take a bold look at something that will never hasnt honesty as a virtue
.
but wheras wag showed us how much affect a few people can have on teh media
, primary colors is much more concerned with fleshing out it ' s characters
, letting us understand what they want
anbd why
,
and making us truly appreciate the humanity
and rectitude that htey graciously represent
. seeing john travolta play bill clinton so confidently
annd justly isnt enough to make the film more than worth a look
.
and tje rest of the cast also amke superb performances
- adrian lester sharply portrays the intellect ofthe henry whilst kathy bates is perfect as the robust
and energetic libby holden
. at occasions
, you can ' t help
but feel that these terrific charactors are going to waste
. there are long slabs of time where john travolta
( unquestionably the most interesting to watch
) is missed from the screen
;
annd since it is awkwardly structured as henry ' s story we are often forced to watch scenes thta perhaps are not so necessary to the central plot
- or even hte point of the film
. haveing said that
, make no mistake
- primary colors is allways enjoyable to watch
.
but frequently we hvae to ask ourselves
- exactly what are we watching
? most of the first half of its duration is a lightheaded look at melodramatic confrontations that seem so genuine we cannot help
but laugh
,
but the way primary colors chooses to finish tackles aspects thyat are very contrary
,
annd almost unsuitable
, tothe the rest of thte film
.
but as i mentioned before
, there isnt a thin line between satire
and controvercy
-
and for the most part
, primary colors delivers an entertaining indulgence of polliticel matters combined with a far
- from
- overpowering look at winning the public ' s opinion
.
although at occasions the film may jump around a little too freely
, focus is never lost on how important
adn vulnerable the subject matter realy is
. thankfully
, it is clear to make the distinction on what isnt entertaining movie cosmetics
and what is a provocative documentation of something so raelly it ' s scary
.
