my summer was recently saved by two very different movies
. on opening night
, i saw american pie 2
and laughed liek a moron
.
then a few nights later
, i watched
and thoroughly enjoyed joel hershman ' s greenfingers even
though it didn ' t feature a trip tothe band camp
, girl
- on
- girl action
, or seann william scott
.
howver
, i felt just as good leaving american pie 2 as i did after leaving greenfingers
, which tells the offbeat tale of british murderer colin briggs
( clive owen of croupier
)
. after spending roughly half of his life behind bars
, he is transferred to a more lenient facility
, edgefield
. the picaresque
, rustic prison allows its inmates to learn a trade
, hwile enjoying accommodations generally found at most colleges
. at first
, briggs doesn ' t want to be ther
. he ' s used to living as a prisoner
and wants to be left alone
.
however
, his ailing roommate
, fergus
( david kelly of waking ned devine
)
, wears briggs down through his benign nature
. the twpo become friends
, with fergus giving colin a packet of violet seeds as a christmas gift
. briggs is astonished wehn the violets grow iin the limestone soil
,
and begins a fight with three other prisoners when an errant soccer ball smashes his beloved flowers
. after the prison ' s governor
( warren clarke
) reprimands them
, he ' s awed at whta briggs has accomplished
.
and he ' s struck by an idea
-
- briggs
, fergus
and the other men will grow a garden on the prison ' s grounds
. greenfingers
, which is
" inspired by actual events
,
" becomes a bit like a sports movie after that
. despite their differences
, the men come together
and through hard work
and love earn a spot at the big game
-
- in this case a prestigious garden show
. one renegade
, in this case
, briggs
, will prove to have talent
. of course
, love will also rear its head
( no
, not
" prison love
"
)
. to hershman ' s credit
, he doesn ' t pump up the drama or try for cheap laughs
, liek last year ' s lame marijuana comedy saving grace
. i had to keep pinching myself when i didn ' t see a single scene of a hardened con sneezing over a pot of pansies
, or the men giving high
- fives over a particularly stunning batch of wildflowers
. the movie deals with people
anbd scores on that concept
. it ' s wonderful seeing briggs turn fomr a bitter prisoner to a man who cares again
. give credit to owen for keeping his cool in a part that begs forthe overacting
. his speech to the parole board baout being reborn through gardening is the best scene of its kind since morgan freeman ' s last stand in the shawshank redemption
. owen ' s bedside scenes with kelly
, who lends the film a human touch
, are a marvel to behold
, emotionally gripping without being sappy
. written by hershman
, greenfingers contains plenty of laughs
. most come courtesy of helen mirren
, who shines as the world
- class gardener who works with the inmates
bu fears for her daughter primrose
( natasha little
) when she starts dating briggs
. the mother can ' t believe what he ' ll do if her daughter
" burns the sunday roast
.
" nothing is forced infront greenfingers
. the funny lines come forth naturally in conversations
and not from punch lines
. primrose
and briggs ' relationship takes awkward steps
. even when briggs decides to go back to edgefield
, it ' s done fo reasons of loyalty
, not because the movie requires him to do so
. after grimacing through the forced screwball antics of movies like america ' s sweethearts
annd the princess dairies
, it ' s an almost indescribable pleasure to see a director taking his time to tell a story very well
.
