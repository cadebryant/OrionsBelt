one way of telling if a film is good or not is by the length
. if a film is only 90 minutes
,
but feels like 300 minutes
,
then it
' s crap
. bu if a film last 2 1
/ 2 hours
,
and feels liuke 90 minutes
,
then it
' s excellant
. boogie nights falls into tghe latter catagory
. thge director
,
anderson
, delivers a funny
, hip
,
yet sometimes violent film
, whic flies allong
. mark whalberg
, a
. k
. a marky mark
, plays eddie adams
, a seventeen year old with a certain
' gift
' in the midriff area
. jack horner
( reynolds
) is a adult film directer
, who decides that eddie would be great iin the adult movie business
. after running away fomr home
, eddie joins jack
, changes his name to dirk diggler
, annd starts making erotic movies
. in the movie business
, dirk meets a whole load of characters
( hwihc the film introduces very quickly
and slickly
) such as scotty
( phillip seymour hoffman
)
, rollergirl
( graham
) amber
( moore
)
and floyd
( phillip baker hall
)
,
and little bill
( william h
. macy
) all hte characters are well written
, well played
,
and the audiance gets to know them preety well
, thanks to the excellent script
. we learn baout ambers grief about nto being able to see her child due to a divorce
, rollergirls hard time at school
,
and little bills wife
, who sleeps iwth everyone except her husb
and
.
but the best thing baout the exellent boogie nights is paul
andersons direction
and writing
. the direction is fast
, thrilling
,
and never holds up
. there are some great shots
, some lovely steadiocam
and h
andheld camera sequences
,
and lots of other neat directional touches
. the writing is fabulous
, with some intelligent dialogue
, soem funny dialogue
,
but none of the dialogue is crap
, like most hollywood films
( such as the lost world
: jurassic park
( 1997
)
, or tommorow never dies
( 1997
)
.
) boogie nights really is a spectacular feat of direction
and writing
, on par
(
and sometimes betters
) quentin tarantino
' s films resevoir dogs
( 1992
)
and pulp fiction
( 1994
) the soundtrack is also excellent
. like american graffiti
( 1973
)
, the film features some great old songs on the soundtrack
, which heightens yhe atmosphere
,
and gives the film an extra lift
. also
, teh costumes are great
. the clothes really do look like what people wore in tghe seventies annd eighties
. the film
,
al
though excellent
, does have some flaws
. firstly
, wahlberg
,
al
though excellent
, cannot dont highly scenes which require him to be angry
. in both scenes where he has to act angry
, his acting is so
' off
'
, tghe scenes tension
and anger is lost
.
but the rest of the cast are excellent
. burt reynolds is brilliant
, julianne moore shows real emotion
,
and william h
. macy is great aswell
(
but he always is
.
) another flwa with the film
,
though
, is that tghe ending seems a bit tacked on
. it seems
anderson saw the film was going on a bit
,
and needed to wrap up quickly
. it
' s a shame
, really
, as the rest of the film is perfectly paced
.
but they
' re small niggles really
. boogie nights is an excellent film
. superb directing
, writing
, acting
and music
, all combine to make one spectacular film
. whatever ytou do
, do not miss out on boogie nights
.
