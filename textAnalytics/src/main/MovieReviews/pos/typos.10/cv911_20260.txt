usually when a blockbuster comes out
, it
' s loaded with effects
, stars
, bad scripts
,
and plenty of action
. mystery men may contain an all
- star casted
,
and efects
,
but the clever scirpt
and characters are what really works
, which is rare to see this year
. the film is based upon the comic book series
" the flaming carrot
" by bob burden
, in which 3 wanna be super heroes try adn fight crime
, only to be outloud done by the real hero of champion city
, captain amazing
( greg kinnear
)
. things go a little haywire
, when the sinister casanova frankenstein
( geoffrey rush
) is released into the city
, where he captures captain amazing
,
and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city
. well
, the trio decide to take matters in their own h
ands
, by saving yhe city
, bu first they need soem assitance
. this is where the film takes a turn for the better
. in the beggining
, there were onyl 3 wanna be heroes
.
" blue raja
( hank azaria
)
,
" mr
. furious
( ben stiller
)
and
" the shoveller
( william h
. macy
)
. sure they were enterataining
,
but their acts grew old fast
. that is until they aquire
" invisible boy
"
( kel mitchell
)
,
and
" the bowler
"
( janeane garafalo
)
and
" mr
. splein
"
( paul reubens
)
, 2 of whitch rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess
. thankfully
, tghe original 3 heroes become amusing
, with some support of reuben
and garfalo on screen
. the whole premise is rather rediculous
,
but packs a few punches to keep interest
. for oen
, the film is considerably clever
. it literally pokes fun at super hero films
, like batman
and robin
, superman etc
. in fact
, many scenes are similar to batman
and robin
, including the opening sequence
, only altered in a humorous
and superior way
. a part of hte cleverness comes from the cast
. sometimes a film with such talent is overblown
, bu the acting is what keesh it alive here
. while azaria
and macy were enteratining
, 2 characters really stood out
. one was paul reuben
. no matter how disgusting or revolting
" mr
. splein
" may be
, you still can
' t help
but laugh
. it
' so incredibly moronic
, it
' s just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions
. janeane garafalo also was an interesting character
. she seemed to be the most outgoing
and convincing character on screem
, due to her enthusiasm
, that kept the film flowing
. men is worth seeing alone
, for those 2 troubled heroes
. on the downside
, a few of the heroes
and especially the villain never really lift off
. kel mitchell
and geoffrey rush
, were both utterly useless
. their parts were so limited
, htey
' d be lucky at all to be on screen fo more than 20 minutes
. ben stiller too was wasted
, mostly because of his unlikeable pwoer
and dialogue
. none of theese characters get a rise out of anybody
,
but happily they are lost in tyhe charming flow of tje film
. as far as the budget goes
, it was wisely spended on the cast
, not the effects
. while the set designs
and action all look nice
, i
' m glad there was a seperate aspect
, that the film focused on
,
and for that i applaud
. slow at times
,
and rather pointless
, mystery men still delivers
. it forgets about money makeing
, because it
' s not likely to make a bundle liuke it
' s proceeders
,
and that
' s what works
. stupid
? maybe
,
but forthe once i
' m nto disappointed
. no one expected an intelligent film
,
but you get a film thats wit captures your attention
and makes you forget thsi miserable year
.
