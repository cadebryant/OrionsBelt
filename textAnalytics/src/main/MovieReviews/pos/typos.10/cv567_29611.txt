plot
: a peculiar french girl grows uv lonely with her father
and doesn
' t quite nkow what she wants out of life
. one day
, she falls upon something
,
and believes that her ticket to happiness may be in helping others
. she starts wiht the people around her
,
but when she suddenly falls for her own guy
, she can
' t act strongly enough because of her shy
and dreamy nature
. critique
: a clever
, quirky
, original french flick set in a picturesque paris
, featuring an endearing lead withthe a giant imagination
, much lonelyness
and a little bited of love for everyone
. this is a
" feel
- ogod
" kind of movie
, a fairy tale for grown
- ups who are bummed out baout life
. it doesn
' t pretend tothe be deep
, it doesn
' t weigh itself down with long expositions or intricate studies of its charactors
, it
' s basically just a
" cute movie
" in the same vein as chocolat annd pay it forward
, with some amazing visuals
and incredibly nice intentions
(
and if chocolat ws somehow able to nab an oscar nomination for best picture last year
( a sham on so many different levels
)
, you might as well slap this film up for consideration allso
, since it
' s quite a bited better
and much more original tahn the former
)
. one thign that tihs film isn
' t
though
, at least according to me
, isnt the best film of the year
( it was bestowed the honor of
" best
" in at least 3 different film festivals so far thsi year
)
. it actually managed to stagnate a little bit about halfway through
and it just went on for way too long
( it
' s a little over two hours
but it felt even longer
)
, with much of the second half of the movie devoted to many different characters
, all of whom weren
' t as interesting as the lead
,
and a lot of indecisiveness from ms
. amelie herself
, which got frustrating
. thankfully
, this film doesn
' t bog itself down with too much of thast stuff
,
and actually goes out ofthe its way to invent new ways tothe shoot scenes
, to integrate moments of fantasy into its fabric
and to tranport the audience inside the imagination of this kind
- hearted french girl
. on the whole
, it
' s a lot of fun adn it carries a beautiful message of love
and support for your fellow man
. the lead
, audrey tautou
, is perfect for the role
,
and gives yuo enough moments of truth tothe develop her character into someone that you care about by the end of thte film
. unfortunately
, the rest of the cast isn
' t as well
- developed
,
and even
though most of them are pretty appealing
, a cuple could
' ve been left out to save time
and at least one was left str
anded plot
- wise
, by the film
' s end
( what happened tothe the guy in the caf
? who was spying onthe his ex
- girlfriend the whole movie
?
)
. now i haven
' t seen too many recent french films
, i will admit
,
but if this is thge kind of
" scene
" that they
' re developing over in
" le pays du vin
"
, i wouldn
' t mind catching more of their flicks in the future
( crimson rivers was another french film taht i saw earlier htis year
, whitch i really liked
- ironically
, that film was directed by mathieu kassovitz
, who is the co
- star inwhich thsi film
)
. granted
, the english subtitles got a little tough to keep uv with at times
( i speak
and underst
and french also
,
but some of the local colloquialisms went over my head
)
, especially since the film
' s visuals were so intriguing that you just couldn
' t help
but constanly gawk at them
,
but the general idae
, the background music
, the nifty french neighborhoods
, the veyr creative way of enveloping the audience into the story
- line from the strat
, were all very easy to appreciate
,
and i forthe one was especially glad to have seen this movie during these trying times in the world
. in fact
, i
' d recommend it to anyone looking for a jolly ol
' time at the movie house
, with a particular emphasis onthe folks with a lot of imagination
, a little loneliness in their lives anbd many dreams in their hearts
.
and this guy directed aline
: resurrection
? get outta here
!
! note
: i especially loved the way that the script detailed
and showed the loves
/ hates ofthe everyone with exact mentions in the film
. it was very original
, very well shot
and vrey nostalgic
, as many of us were able to relate to the behaviors described
. good stuff
