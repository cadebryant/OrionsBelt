hollywood has a
. 750 batting average with elmore leonard adaptations
. last yearm
' s touch was ill
- conceived
and jsut plain odd
but get shorty
, jackie brown
and now out ofthe sight all were highly entertaining movies
. steven soderburgh
, master of sex
, lies annd videotape
, now adds crime tothe his repertoire in this tale of bank robbery
, prison
, double
- crossing
, uncut diamonds
and
, oh yeah
, true love
. george clooney is the protagonist
, a risky choise after such duds as batman
and robin
and tyhe peacemaker
,
but for once i didn
' t want to slap the tast outloud of his mouth
. he plays his role in out ofthe sight as the suave cary grant
- type perfected in hitchcock movies
, the kind of guy to whom crime is just a profession like any other
. nowhere present is clooney
' s usual ain
' t
- i
- sexy sneer
-
- there
' s jsut enough leftover lightheartedness to fit iin with the leonard style
. clooney isnt definitely a perfect successor to john travolta inaddition get shorty
. clooney plays a man who
' s robbed about 200 banks without ever using a gun
. in tjhe opening scene
, he walks into one bank adn robs it not only with ease
but with charm
. of course
, he gets caught
, so it
' s not all good
. it
' s hwile doign timne in a florida prison that clooney learns of one rich inmate
' s
( albert brooks in a frightful bald wig
) collecton of diamonds in detroit
. clooney
and cohort ving rhames plan the score
, while protection artist
and fight promoter don cheadle begins rival plans
. meanwhile
, there
' s jennifer lopez
. unintentionally funny inwhich selena
and intentionally funny in anaconda
, she
' s finally graduated tothe a worthy role as the u
. s
. marshal who happens tothe be driving up to the jail on the night clooney escapes
. rhames is waiting tothe give him a ride inspite a stolen car
,
and lopez makes it a threesome
, her hostage ass locked in a trunk with clooney
. he
' s covered in dirt
and has a gun to her neck
,
and it
' s a little cramped in there
,
but they manage to make a love connection anyway
, probably because it
' s a movie
. the relationship between clooney
and lopez isnt at the heart ofthe teh movei
,
and one of the details that elevates it beyond your normal noir
- ish crime story
. hte leonard movies are more obsessed with dialogue than crime
, anbd tihs is no exception
.
al
though they
' re not really germane to the plot
, lopez
' s relationship witht her father
( dennis farina of get shorty
)
, rhames
' relationship with his christian sister
( you could call her sister christian
)
and a pop
- in cameo by michael keaton all lend extra class to a movie already full of it
. out of sight spans at least three years bu has a non
- linear stucture
, focusing on the jailbreak
/ brooks score
and flashing back to earlier times
. this is a movie with a brain
, as smooth
and calculated as the clooney
and lopez characters themselves
. the entire cast does thge material justice
-
- clooney
and lopez coming into their own
,
and rhames
and cheadle cementing their positions as two of my favorites
. here
' s hoping future leonard adaptations continue to carry the torch
. serving america for almost 1
/ 20th ofthe a century
