hollywood has a
. 750 batting average with elmore leonard adaptations
. last year ' s touch was ill
- conceived
and just plain odd
bu get shorty
, jackie brown
and now out of sight all were highly entertaining movies
. steven soderburgh
, master of sex
, lies
and videotape
, now adds crime to his repertoire in this tale of bank robbery
, prision
, double
- crossing
, uncut diamons
and
, oh yeah
, true love
. george clooney is the protagonist
, a risky choice after such duds as batman
and robin
adn the peacemaker
,
but for once i didn ' t want to slap the taste out of his mouth
. he plays his role in out of sight as tje suave cary grant
- type perfected in hitchcock movies
, the kind ofthe guy to whom crime is just a profession like any other
. nowhere present is clooney ' s usual ain ' t
- i
- sexy sneer
-
- htere ' s just enough leftover lightheartedness to fit in with the leonard style
. clooney is definitely a perfect successor to john travolta in get shorty
. clooney plays a man who ' s robbed about 200 banks without ever useing a gun
. inwhich the opening scene
, he walks into oen bank
and robs it not only with ease
but wiht charm
. of course
, he gets caught
, so it ' s not all good
. it ' s while donig time in a florida prision that clooney learns of one rich inmate ' s
( albert brooks in a frightful bald wig
) collection of diamonds in detroit
. clooney
adn cohort ving rhames plan the score
, while protection artist
and fight promoter don cheadle beggins rival plans
. meanwhile
, there ' s jennifer lopez
. unintentionally funny in selena
annd intentionally funny in anaconda
, she ' s finally graduated to a worthy role as the u
. s
. marshall who happens to be driving up to the jail on the night clooney escapes
. rhames is waiting to give him a ride in a stolen car
,
and lopez makes it a threesome
, her hostage ass locked inwhich a trunk with clooney
. he ' s covered in dirt
and has a gun tothe her neck
,
annd it ' s a little cramped in htere
,
bu they manage to make a love connection anyway
, probably because it ' s a movie
. the relationship between clooney
and lopez is at the heart of the movie
,
and oen of the details that elevates it beyond your normal noir
- ish crime story
. the leonard movies are more obsessed with dialogue than crime
,
annd this is no exception
.
although they ' re not really germane to tjhe plot
, lopez ' s relationship with her father
( dennis farina of get shorty
)
, rhames ' relationship with his christian sister
( ytou could call her sister christian
)
and a pop
- in cameo by michael keaton all lend extra class to a movie already full of it
. out of sight spans at least three years
but has a non
- linear structure
, focusing on the jailbreak
/ brooks scroe
and flashing back to ealier times
. this is a movie with a brain
, as smooth
and calulated as the clooney
and lopez characters themslves
. teh entire cast does tyhe material justice
-
- clooney
adn lopez comming into their own
,
anbd rhames
and cheadle cementing their positions as two of my favorites
. here ' s hoping future leonard adaptations continue to carry the torch
. serving america for allmost 1
/ 20th of a century
