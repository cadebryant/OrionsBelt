i must admit i
' m going to be a bit biased in my review of the new rumatic comedy serendipity
, because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend
. the magic
and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness
and freshness ofthe the very funny adn very romantic serendipity
. i am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre
,
but something drew me to thsi film
. maybe it was the casting ofthe the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role
,
and the hilarious eugene levy
. maybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity
, con air
,
and pushing tin
.
but maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life
. the story of serendipity isnt simple
. two people
, john trager
( john cusack
)
and sara thomas
( kate beckinsale
, looking ever so hot
)
, have a chance encounter over a pair of gloves
-
- with buck henry smack dab in the middle
. charmed beyond repair
, theese two knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf
? called serendipity
, talk about that irresponsible thing called fate anbd tjhe avenues it leads people down
,
and spend a few hours at the local ice skating rink
.
but with each of them already involved with otehr parties
, sara has john write his name
and number on a
$ 5 bill
and she writes her name
and number on a copy of love in teh time of colera
. sara declares thyat if this
" thing
"
-
- let
' s just call it love
-
- is destined to happen
, fate iwll bring them together in the future
. years later
and on opposite coasts ofthe america
, john
and sara
-
- both engaged
but still unsure whether tehy have found their soul mates
-
- decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts
. what happens
then is an enjoyable
and often hilarious cat
-
and
- mouse game with the fates
- involving such items as mistaken identity
, a graduate homage
, john corbett as a freaky new age musician
,
and eugene levy as an irate
and crazed salesman
-
- to find out if tht
" thing
" was right after all
. fortunately
, first
- time screenwriter marc klein has sketched strong
, well
- rounded
, characters to propell a predictable
and corny narrative
. coupled with deft directing by michael chelsom
( director of the very unfunny twon
and country
and thge very funny funny bones
)
and the use of time
- lapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years
-
- tyhe film comes off wih genuine believability annd sincerity
. both piven
and molly shannon make nice sidekick characters on the flipside
, films such as you
' ve got mail
, made in heaven
,
and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the film
' s main journey at h
and
.
but it
' s what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind in the romantic wake after john
and sara find happiness this is the most unsettling part of the picture
.
