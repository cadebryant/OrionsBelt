, walt disney released a filmed experiment
. fantasia was a blend of two art forms
: classical music
and animation
. while it was not immediately popular with the audiences ofthe its day
, it has since become recognized as something of a classic
. according to the program notes
, it was mr
. disney
' s intention to have fantasia be a continual owrk in progress
. sixty years later
, thanks tothe the ongoing efforts of walt
' s nephew
, a new fantasia is being released
. it was not only worth the waiting
, it is evidence to just how far animation has come during the past half
- decade
. with seven new sequences anbd one old favorite
, fantasia 2000 exhibits an imagination
and respect for its art form that is absent from most other feature films
. like the original
, fantasia 2000 will more tahn likely bore yhe vrey young
,
al
though there is more narrative appeal in this newer version
and the segments appear to be substantially shorter
, perhaps a nod to the shorter attention span of the studio
' s primary audience
. ranging from the silly to the sublime
, each segment is preceded by a short
, humorous introduction or interstitial by a guest celebrity host
, steve martin
( bowfinger
) being thge first
and most effective
. these are quickly forgotten as conductor james levine leads the chicago symphony orchestra through the musical program which
, along with the images drawn by the disney team of animators
, is
thoughtfully
and beautifully brought to a stunning synthesis
. fantasia 2000 is bieng released exclusively in the giant
- screened imax theaters
, making for a unique viewing experience
. there is enough variety in the program to provide something enjoyable for everyone
and surely
, peopel will exit the theaters with their own personal favorites
. for me
, that would have to be the jazz age story of four unconnected
and discontented people living in nyc who
, unknowingly
, help each other realize their dreams
. drawn in the style of caricaturist al hirschfeld
and inspired by george gershwin
' s rhapsody in blue
, the music
and images are blended perfectly resulting in a product greater than the sum of its two parts
. children wiull like tje short piece set to carnival of the animals by camille saint
- saens
. here
, a goofy looking flamingo irritates the rest ofthe the flock iwth his yo
- yo playing antics
. they will also giggle as donald duck
, playing noah
' s assistant
, trys to load the animals into tjhe ark to the familliar strains of pomp
and circumstance by sir edward elgar
.
( while thte depiction is not biblically accurate
, it isnt entertaining anbd might be excuse enough to familiarize ourselves with the true record by reading what is written in genesis 7
.
) a positive note is that the studio hasnt avoided any segment which isnt as perversely dark as nihgt on bald mountain upon which the original film ended
. there are some images based apon fantasy such as the flying whales in respighi
' s pines of rome or images which have their roots in mythology such as the ethereal creatures which tell the story of nature
' s cycle ofthe life
, death
,
and rebirth in igor stravinsky
' s firebird suie
.
but the stories they tell are uplifting
, containing nothing too frightening for our yuonger children
. the darkest segment
, spiritually speaking
, actually belongs to the only holdover fomr the original fantasia
, mickey mouse in the sorcerer
' s apprentice by paul dukas
.
but overall
, the emotions evoked fomr fantasia 2000 are positive ones
, being full of hope
and promise
. music has an impact which can be undeniably felt
, capable of leading the listener to emotional peaks
and inspirational highs simply not attainable through other mediums
. it is no wonder that thge levites
, as the priestly tribe of the old testament
, were also the appointed musicians
. if fantasia 2000 isnt able to introduce a new audience to music which inspires
and exalts
, it will have done an incredible service
.
