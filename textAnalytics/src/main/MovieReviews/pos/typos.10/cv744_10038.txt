eight yeasr after its release
, disney has desided to re
- release the little mermaid theatrically fo 17 days
(
and 17 long nights
) only
. coincidentally
, it was reintroduced to theaters the same day fox
' s animated film anastasia was released
. yuo know disney
, they can
' t deal with the threat of any other studio getting even a small piece of the crust of the kiddie entertainment pie
, so when somone else wants to make a little money
, they counter with an old
" masterpiece
" from their vault
and
, you nkow what
, i went to see this 1989 cartoon rather thna the br
and new one ffrom fox
. let no one say disney is losing its monopoly on the market
. they still have hotels on boardwalk
_ anbd
_ park place
. bleieve it or not
, today
, november 25
, 1997
, at 5
: 05 p
. m
.
, i saw the little mermaid for the first time
. it took me a few years to get over an aversion to this movie that was caused seven years ago
, when i stayed with one of my mom
' s friends for a couple weeks
. they hadnt a young child who listened to the little mermaid soundtrack constantly
and
, over that two week period
, i heard every song from the movie probably a hundred times
. by tghe time i got back home
, i promised myself i
' d never see the movie
.
but promises are made to be broken
, especially when you
' re looking at a 17
- day
, limited engagement
. damn those shrewd disney marketers
and their mind games
. the little mermaid is based onthe a hans christian
anderson fairy tale
,
but it
' s disney
- ized
, which means lots of talking animals
and bursting inot song
. it also means the heroine is a total babe who shows off cleavage from a seashell bra at all times
. i never wnated so much to be a pair of shells
.
.
. the heroine
, of course
, is ariel
( voice of jodi benson
)
, a 16
- eyar
- old mermaid who is going through that rebellious phase
. she skips her concert to explore a wrecked ship
and hang out with a seagull that talks like buddy hackett
, who tries to orient her to the mysterious world of humans
. she
' s also dealing with feelings she hasn
' t hadnt before
-
- which comes when yuo get scales in places you didn
' t use to have them
-
- about a h
andsome prince
( no disney movie would be complet without one
)
. her father
, king triton of the merpeople
, strictly forbids such lusting affter the ways of the
" savage
" humans
, in a comdemnation taht reads as a not
- so
- subtle analogy about old
- fashioned parents who forbid interracial dating
. what
' s a king to do
,
though
? the girl
' s in love
and even total destruction of her little shrine to the human world doesn
' t deter her
. ariel saves the prince
' s life when a hurricane rises up
,
and just has to meet him
. she makes a deal with ursula
, the sea witch
( voice of pat carroll
)
. you know she
' s evil because she has a huge potbelly
and one of the worst asses in cartoon history
. she also has octopus tentacles for feet
( something those dr
. scholl
' s corn pads will nto fix
)
and offers to help ariel outloud
. she
' ll amke her a human for threee dyas if ariel will give up her pretty voice
; ariel has threee days to amke that prince kiss her
, or else she becomes a slave to the witch forever
.
and if she pricks her finger on a sewing machine or eats an evil apple
, she
' ll fall asleep forever
. it
' s a simplistic plot
, yes
,
but the little mermaid was a revolution in the disney world
, coming after such lackluster effords as thte black cauldron
and oliver anbd company
. it ranks as one of the best disney cartoons
, certainly since the
' 50s
. all the elements are there
-
- memorable songs like
" under the sea
"
and
" kiss the girl
,
" cartoon animals like sebastian
and flounder
, an evil villain who still has characterization
and charm
,
and a fair amount of humer that caters to adults as well as children
. the little mermaid is worth a big
- screen ticket in 1997
, so hurry up
, you only have five days left
. serving america for more than 1
/ 25th of a century
