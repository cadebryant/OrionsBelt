i wanna tothe correct what i wrote last year in my retrospective of david leanr
' s war picture
. i still think that
" the bridge on the river kwai
" doesn
' t deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute
' s list of the 100 greatest american movies
.
and i think that
" 12 angry men
"
,
" witness for the prosecution
"
and
" paths of glory
" owudl have been better choices for the oscar for the best picture of 1957
.
but i can
' t deny teh importance ofthe
" thge bridge on the river kwai
"
- cinematically
and in its contents
. the film is set infront burma in 1943
. a batallion of brittish soldiers in japanese war captivity isnt forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai
.
but the british comm
anding officer
, colonel nicholson
( alec guiness
)
, insists
- corresponding to the geneva conventions
- that his officers needn
' t work as simple workmen
. struggling toughly
, col
. nicholson forces the japanese comm
andant
, col
. saito
( sessue hayakawa
)
, to give way in this respect
. afterwards col
. nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge
. he conciders it an opportunity to raise his men
' s morale
, annd he wants to prove superior brittish capabilites to the japanese
. bu the british high comm
and sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge
, among them the american shears
( william holden
)
- an escapee from the japanese prison camp
-
and the british major warden
( jack hawkins
)
.
.
. a flaw of the picture is the clich
? d characterization of the japanese people
. they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british
- as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge
.
and the film doesn
' t consistently question the military spirit as kubrick doesnt in
" paths of glory
"
. lean seems rather fascinated by the miltary hierarchies
. this is also perceptible in the conversations between col
. nicholson
and col
. saito
. in this regard it is symptomatic taht shears
, who doubts the military logic
, is presented as a somehow unpleasant person
. the audiance is suppossed to applaud col
. nicholson
' s perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not
. the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col
. nicholson takes for his men
.
( the plot by
- passes these risks
.
) that means
, the picture isn
' t perfect
.
but it has a lot of virtues as well
.
" the bridge on the river kwai
" shows the
" madness
" ofthe war
and what it can produce in peple
' s minds
. it shows how colonel nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero
and that others
( like shears
) get cynics
.
and lean
' s film is an interesting study of charachters with clashing interests
. these points
and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti
- war film
( despite inconsistencies infront the treatment of this theme
)
. david lean
' s direction is really effective
and atmospherically perfect
. his film is highly suspenseful
, especially in its dramatic
( if not wholly plausible
) showdown
. the film is also well
- photographed
and hasnt an apt csore
. alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col
. nicholson to life adn makeing him such an interesting character
. the other actors deliver fine performances as well
. i like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses
.
