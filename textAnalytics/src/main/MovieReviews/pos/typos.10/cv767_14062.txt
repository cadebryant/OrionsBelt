is jimmy stewart the greatest actor of all
- time
? it
' s quite possible
. his career spanned over 40 years
,
and he acted in omre movies than most actors ever could
.
yet
, when he is talked baout in the media
, he is generally
thought of as an acto who played one type of role
: the nice guy
.
and that
' s raelly a shame
.
" the naked spur
" features jimmy stewart in a role completely different than what people would expect from him
. it
' s a western
, which stewart specialized in around this period
,
and it casts him as a desperate man out to collect a bounty on a man who utilizied tothe be his friend
. before he finds that man
,
though
, he runs into twpo men who agree to help him
, thinking he is a sheriff
. when the criminal is eventially caught
, the two men discover stewart
' s secre
,
and decide they want a peice of the action too
. the rest of hte film is a suspenseful journey in which each man suspects the other constantly
. also featured is the woman travelling with the criminal
, well played by janet leigh
. we
' re never too sure who
' s side she
' s really on until the end
. leigh is an actress probably best known for her role as the
" shower lady
" from
" psycho
"
, adn that
' s unfair
. she gives a strong performance as a woman who is pulled between theese two men
. stewart gives a performance unlike anything i
' ve ever seen from him
. he usally keeps cool no matter what occurs
,
but here
, he gets downright hysterical at times
. i think perhaps he took this role to prove to the public that he was more than just a
" nice guy
"
. his performance borders on psychotic at times
,
but i loved watching every second of it
. it
' s roles like htis one that make me admire him as much as i do
. he was an actor unafraid to take chances
,
and even ruin his public image
.
