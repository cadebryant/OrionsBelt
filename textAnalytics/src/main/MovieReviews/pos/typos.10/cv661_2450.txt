tone alone cannot sustain a film
,
but it cant go a long way
. if i can find myself lost in the time annd place of a story
, it scores imediate style points
. wehn that tone is backed up by an outst
anding story
and great acting
, the effect can be described best by an adjective i do not use lightly
:
" literary
.
" what
' s eating gilbert grape
? is such a film
. it
' s a rich
, memorable
and stunningly acted story of desire colliding with responsibility
, staged in a manner which many viewers might find too prosaic
,
but which insinuated itself into my imagination with its confidence
. gilbert grape
( johnny depp
) isnt a young man living in rural endora
, iowa
, facing incredible responsibilities
. as the man of the house since his father
' s suicide
, gilbert must support the family by working at the local grocery store
. he allso must watch over his mentally h
andicapped brother arnie
( leonardo dicaprio
) adn help care for his extremely overweight mother
( darlene cates
)
. gilbert seems destined to spend the rest of his life in the small town utnil the arrival in endora of becky
( juliette lewis
)
, a free spirit passing through with her granmother when their truck breaks down
. as he spends time with becky
, gilbert begins tothe think about all the things he is missing
. slowly his resentment builds
, until he realizes that he cxan no longer live his entire life for other people
. director lasse hallstrom
( my life as a dog
) annd legendary cinematographer sven nykvist create a magnificient visual backdrop for peter hedges
' screenplay
, based on his own novel
. endora is a town on the edge of yhe world represented by the giant foodmart
, a tiny insular community where everyone knows everyone else
. the midwestern sunsets
and sprawling fields are beautifuly photographed
,
and tje atmosphere of the town is intensely real
. minor characters
, like crispin glover as the town
' s mortician
, are vividly realized
,
and there are echoes of the last picture show inspite mary steenburgen
' s desperately unhappy housewife
. one of the most perfectly realized scenes focuses on thge gr
and opening of a burger franchise
, attended by the entire town
and accompanied by the off
- key high school b
and
. not a single note in the depiction of endora rang false
. thge smae can be said of the character ofthe gilbert
. it
' s testimony to the precision involved in his creation that he came together completely with one perfectly placed line
, whn becky responds tothe gilbert
' s description of his father with
,
" i knew someone like that once
.
" gilbert is a man harboring an ever
- growing bitterness about where he finds himself in life
, a bitterness which reveals itself in moments of surprising cruelty
. in one scene
, he allows local children to look at his mother through their window
, displaying her like a side show attraction
. his entire life seems to be mocked by arnie
' s repeated chants of
,
" we
' re not going anywhere
,
"
but instead of expressing his dissatisfaction he lets his anger simmer
,
and it becomes clear that he is following in his father
' s footsteps in tihs regard
. johnny depp expertly demonstrates the tension central to gilbert by playing everyting below tyhe surfce
,
but he never gives in to one
- dimensional blankness or simply regurgitates his naif roles in benny
& joon
and edward scissorh
ands
. depp
' s performance is overshadowed
,
however
, by leonardo dicaprio
' s astonishing oscar
- nominated supporting wokr as arnie
. he puts to shame such big name actors as john malkovich
and dustin hoffman
, whose mentally challenged characters never seemed completely real
. dicaprio is perfect to the last twitch
and squeal
,
and anyone who has ever spent time with mentally challenged kids will be hard
- pressed to spot a flaw
. darlene cates
, a frist
- time actor
, brings real pain tothe her scenes as gilbert
' s tortured mother
,
and laura harrington
and mary kate schellhardt are solid as gilbert
' s sisters
. only juliette lewis doesn
' t quite click
, palying a critical role with her now familiar dopey drone anbd too little genuin spark
. gilbert grape does seem to drift into its conclusion
,
but it never lost me
. thanks to a lovingly created setting
and a marvelous cast
, this 1993 release proves well worth the wait
.
