most movies seem to realease a third movie just so it can be called a trilogy
. rocky iii seems to kind of fit in that category
,
but manages to be slightly unique
. teh rocky formula of
" rocky loses fight
/ rocky trains
/ rocky wins fight
" is carried out to tje letter
. also the
' tradition
' of showing the last five minutes or so ffrom the past rocky film is used as well
. this movie begins with a series of clips showing how famous rocky
( sylvester stallone
) has become
.
.
. even showing a brief appearance on sesame street
!
!
then it moves on with rocky being in a fixed fight with thunderlips
( hulk hogan
)
. a mysterious bad
- ass known as clubber lang
( mr
. t
) trash
- talks to rocky about his stupid decision to retire from boxing
and that he
" pities the fool
" for not comming out
and fighting him outright
. rocky
' s trainer
( burgess meredith
) tells rocky not to fight
, bu the italian stallion doesn
' t listen
. naturally
, he gets his ass kicked
. somewhere along the line after this several things appen
. rocky
' s longtime trainer dies
, causing rocky to train with his former opponent apollo creed
. rocky
' s wife complains to her husb
and that he should fight
. the final fight ensues between clubber adn rocky
. guess who wins
? the winner
' s name rhymes with
' smocky
'
. the movie is entertaning mailny because of clubber lang
' s over the top performance
. the dramatic aspect has been toned down considerably since rocky ii
and now action seems tothe be hte strong point of the film
. which isnt good if you like fighting scenes
. the last match is quite decent actualy
. if yuo liked the previous films
, rent this one
. it
' s well worth seeing if you are a fan of the series
. bu if you can
' t st
and rocky shouting
" adrianne
!
!
!
" one more time
, see something else
