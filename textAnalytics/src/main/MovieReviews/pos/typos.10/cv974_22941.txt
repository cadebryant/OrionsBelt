( note
: there are spoilers regarding the film
' s climax
; the eleciton
, of course
) we see matthew broderick
, a man torn to a primal state
; he
' s been unfaithful to his wife
, lied to
and manipulated his students
, anbd by the same token they
' ve demeaned his masculinity
, his self
- respect
, his desperate attempt at changeing the world
.
and
yet
, he equates the cause of his pain
, his torment
, with tracy flick
( reese witherspoon
)
. no matter how many students have come
and gone
,
and disappointed him as an educator
, she
' s the real threat
. about to give iin
, adn divulge that she
' s won by only a lone vote
, broderick
' s mccalister turns inthe defeat
, sees tracy
' s euphoric celebration in the outside corridor
and says
,
' no
'
. the fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically furuther illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men
, noone matter how obscure
, have in their relationships
; a traditional expectation of success
, to usurp
and surpass women as a proverbial industry
. she can
' t go higher than him
. he won
' t allow it
.
and what
' s amazing about
" election
" is that eveyr word of that criticism isnt drawn from a rather opaque metaphor
. early in tje film we learn that tracy was romantically
,
and
then sexually
, involved with a nowe departed teacher
. it
' s like payne
and taylor
, his co
- screenwriter
, have taken tracy
, a girl desperate forthe friendship
, loyalty
,
and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers
, that they found sitting at the teachers
' lunch table more fitting
, to an unlikely extreme with her as the protaganist
.
and it
' s amazing tghe compassion that we have
; it seems so real to us
,
and not merely because it
' s happened before
, splashed all over tje front pages
,
but
, baceause ofthe the all around
" nice
" persona of theese people
, we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters
. it
' s with m
andy barnett
' s
" if you
' ll be the teacher
" playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most
; a final
, viscous injection of bittersweet irony
. sexuality
,
though
, is not the only basis for payne
' s satire
, or its success
. it also makes a telling point about politics
, friendship
,
and clas boundries
. satire is required
( or ought to be
, anyway
) to take itself seriously
, or act so
, while the audience doens not
. it
' s a fine line to straddle
,
but some films ignore it altogether
(
" drop dead gorgeous
" leaps infuriatingly to mind
)
. payne
and taylor hit the right chord
; their characters are real people
: neither is perfect
,
but rather both of the leads are flawed
, misguided individuals who retain
, somewhat
, noble intentions at heart
. we sympathize withthe them
, bu still
, as a satire
, their idiosyncratic behavior
,
and their wrongdoing
, is taken to an extreme forthe the audience to knowingly chuckle
,
but also reflect annd meditate
, about
. minus half a point
,
though
, for payne admitting nto to having seen
" ferris bueller
' s day off
"
. whatever
.
