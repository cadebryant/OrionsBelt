- country
and deside to fool around witht a trucker on their cb radio

) anbd tje next thnig you know
, the trucker is following them too
. lotsa nuttiness ensues anbd

, venna
, a girl who the dude has a crush on
. bu what
' s this
.
.
.
? tghe trucker is still on their tail
and is now harassing all three of the young whippersnappers
.
.
.
? ytou bet
! buckle up
, dorothy
.
.
. this is gonna be one bumpy ride
! critique
: a good ol
' time at the movies
! here
' s a film taht actually gives away most ofthe its plotline in its trailer
and doesn
' t really bring anything
" new
" to the forefront
( if ytou
' ve seen flicks like duel
and breakdown
, you
' ve crossed this path before
)
,
but still manages to entertain you gangbusters
, with realistic situations
, believable characters
, funny moments
, thrills
, chills
, the hwole shebang
. let
' s give it up for directer john dahl
, who continues to put out solid films every other year
( if you haven
' t seen red rock west
, do yourself a favor right now
,
and jot it down on a piece ofthe paper
and rent it at your earliest convenience
)
.
and much like that film
, this one has an excellant premise
and sets everything up at an even pace
. it gives you a little bit ofthe background on each ofthe the main three characters
,
and
then shows you how one small prank
, can lead to a whole lotta trouble for everyone
! paul walker relaly surprised me inspite this movie
, since i
' ve never much
thought of him as anything more than a pretty face
(
and damn
, is it ever pretty or what
?
!
)
but here
, he acutally manages to put some depth behind the looks
and that
' s always appreciated in films in which you are so closely tied to the main characters
. sobieski is also good
, bu she isn
' t in the movie for as long as you
' d think
,
but tghe man who really takes this film tothe another level
, is steve zahn
. if you
' ve loved this guy as the
" goofball
" in most of his previvous roles
, you
' ll apprieciate him even more here
, as the dude who starts off as one of the most manic
and excited human beings i
' ve seen in quite some time
(
" this is so awesome
!
!
"
)
, onyl to turn into a man scared outloud of his wits by the end of the flick
.
and speaking of the ending
, boy
, does this movie deliver some chilling moments during its final 15 clicks or what
?
!
? the arrow
and i were practically in each others arms
( well
, maybee i
' m exaggerating
,
but ytou catch my drift
) as each minute brought about another turn of events which in turn
, took it all to an even higher level
. once again
, kudos to director dahl for being able to ganerate that type ofthe intensity
, suspense
and tension
, with a great score
, editing
, sytle
and camerawork
. plot
- wise
, i too did wonder how the
" bad guy
" was able to track them so well
,
but it didn
' t really bother me all that much
( you can assume that he had bugged their car
?
)
.
but pretty much everything else in the story sticked like glue
and i couldn
' t help
but put myself infact their shoes
and appreciate their thoroughly desperate circumstance
. a great movie with an even cooler ending
, this film will likely be remembered as one of the better thrillers ofthe the yearm
.
" this is amazing
!
