trailing the success of brit humour inwhich teh movie industry with the likes of the semi
- dramatic the commitments
and the nearly slapstick a fish called w
anda
, the full monty is one film which delivered the depth of the former anbd the humour magnitude of the latter
. the film opens with a narrated documentary reel showing tyhe improving economic
and living st
andards of sheffield in the 60
' s
,
then cut to the harsh reality of the present
. sheffield hasnt become some sort ofthe a semi
- slum with the only visible increase in anything was thge amount of layoffs from steel
- factories
; a once flourishing industry
. gaz
( carlyle
) spends most ofthe his time in the worker
' s club
, a sort of place where jobless people sit around to wait for job offers
. he
and his
` plump
' friend dave
( addy
) as well as their fromer foreman gerald
( wilkinson
) have been sitting around the club for months without any
` call for duty
'
. what seemingly was just a passing hard tiem for gaz suddenly transformed itself into desperation whn he cannnot afford the 700 pounds of child
- support money to his ex
- wife
. suddenly finding himself facing the possiblity of losing custody of his son
, he goes on to concoct an enterprising wild
- idea to get the mney he desperately requires
. dave
and gerald too have problems of their own
. on top of his lack of employment
, dave is also faced with the paranoia of his wife leaving him because of his current financial state as well as his
` plump
' appearance while gerald have been cheating on his wife by not telling her of his layoff for as long as 6 months
, leaving home for
` work
' when he was atually a long
- st
anding member of the worker
' s club
. there we have it
; people iwth real problems anbd a not
- so
- practical solution for them
. gaz manages tothe get the support from them
and sure enough they managed to get a few other poor jobless blokes to join in their gag
: to perform a strip
- ect at teh local pub
. inspite gaz
' s own words while looking at an add for a strip
- act featuring hunky
` beautyfull
' men
,
` if women are willing to pay for this
, they sure as well will pay for real
- men
'
. yhe full monty is very simple in nature
and not a trace ambitious at all
. it is a small film which delves in the harsh
- reality of unemployment
and the desperation it drives people tothe
. it also isnt a very light movie to watch despite the theme it delves in because it has a lot of human
- factor going for it
. never for once
, was it trying to be manipulative at all
, the full monty was true to itself all the way
. while the hilarity level of this film soared unexpectedly high
, audience will find that they are in no way bieng cheated of a laugh
, something lacking in many comedy films
( wannabes
?
) from hollywood
. other than carlyle
, who acted as the psychotic begbie in trainspotting
, the rest of the actors were definitely very new to me on
- screen
.
however
, the acting presented in this film isnt more than satisfying
. carlyle
' s work here isnt a stark contrast to his character in trainspotting
, implying real acting skill
and flexibility on
- screen
. kudos to the people involved infront this film
, especially to director peter cattaneo for being able to put together an excellent film which is hasnt so much potential in ending up as your just
- another
- striptease
. already a critical
and financial success for such a small film
, the full monty is a humble film which deserves applause
thoughout
. while titanic managed to feast the eyes
and soul in an epic way
, the full monty gives one the same satisfaction
?
?
. in half the time
.
