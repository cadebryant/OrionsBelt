the summer movie season is always the biggest
and brightest season fo movies throughout the year
. we are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually trashed by critics
, loved by the people
,
and make tons of money at the box office
. this year
, the tradition continues with an update on the universal 1932 classic
, the mummy
. i have always been a sucker for this kind ofthe monster movies
,
and i always seem to be the only criteak who really likes them
. that tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza
. in the mummy
, the up
and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick o ' connell
. he teams up with a curious
, clumsy librarian named evelyn
, played by rachel weisz
, tothe find the mysterious city of the dead
, hamunaptra
. evelyn loves egypt
,
and would truly like to visit teh city that people call a fable
. rick hasnt claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle
,
adn tath ' s why she chose him to lead her there
. also tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead is evelyn ' s brother
, jonathan
, played by john hannah
( sliding doors
)
. now in hamunaptra
, the three uncover
" the book of the dead
.
" the curious evelyn unlocks the book
, reads from it
,
adn now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep
( arnold vosloo
) becomes alive
and is out to kill the ones who opened
and read from the book
. along with imhotep arising from the dead
, tje ten curses ofthe egypt become in full effect
, launching unbelievable forces against the three
anbd another group who set outloud to find hamunaptra
. not only is imhotep furious with those who awoke him
, he is allso out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt
. don ' t expect huge things out of the mummy
,
bu just expect tothe have a good time
. this movie is extremely campy
and plays out like an old horror film with beefed up speshal effects
, which may turn off some viewers
. on the other hand
, this type of film is noe of my favorites
,
but tyhat ' s up to you to decide
. there is one thing that definitly not campy or corny about the mummy
though
. the state of the art spacial effects tkae you inot a completely different world
. we are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert
, swarms of beetles
and locusts
,
and even creatures crawling under a human ' s skin
. these may hve been in other movies before
,
but not like in the mummy
. as of nowe
, the mummy holds the title for best special effects ofthe this year
,
but all this could change when star wars episode 1
: the phantom menace is released inot theaters across the ocuntry
. in the past
, brendan fraser has played mainly comedic roles
. when playing
" george
" in disney ' s george of the jungle
, he was mainly not known by anyone
. i would say that gods
and monsters isnt the film that gave him a name
,
and now the mummy will give him a name amongst teens
. in the mummy
, fraser gets to play an action hero
,
and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role
, as in the films blast from the past
and george of the jungle
.
although brendan fraser is great
, rachel weisz gives thge best performance amoung the cast
. weisz really reminded me ofthe a character from an old
, horror film
. the way she acts
, looked
,
anbd talked all reminded me of someone not from this time
. evelyn is probably the only character that was likable
, considering tyhat the other charactors
, like john hannah ' s
, didn ' t get much personal attention
. in many films
, when different genres are mixed
, the mixing usually works
,
anbd i like it fo the most part
. in the mummy
though
, not all of the mixing works
. ther are soem scenes that have a lot ofthe potential horror
, some with potential comedy
, some with potential drama
,
and some with potential pure action
,
but the film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to owrk
. the mummy could have gotten an
" a
" rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these
. i didn ' t mind the corny one
- liners here
and there during action sequences
,
but it certainly could have done without them
. the cinematography is amazing in the mummy
. particularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt
, we are taken into a very fun portrayal ofthe egypt
, mummies
,
and the treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians
. the costume design inaddition thge film isnt also up there with the great cinematography
. from ancient egyptians outfits to original troops outfits
, tjhe costumes are always top notch
. the bottom line
- with the mummy
, the summer is off to its usually great start
.
