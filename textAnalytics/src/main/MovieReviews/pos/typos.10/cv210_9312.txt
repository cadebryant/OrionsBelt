i must sday from the outset that i have never been much of a kurt russell fan
. i
' ve seen some ofthe his films
( silkwood
, backdraft
, unlawful entry
)
and while he gave adequate performances
, i have never been impressed wiht his work
. breakdown
,
then
, isnt something of a surprize
. russell gives a fine performance
, as do most of the cast
, one thyat is nto upstaged by the action orchestrated in the second half of the film
. to say that he holds the film together would nto be completely true
,
but he does it no harm
. russell plays jeff
, one half of a married couple travelling whith his wife amy
( kathleen quinlan
) cross country to san diego to start a new job
and a new life
. while journeying through yhe desert their car breaks down
and
, left helpless
and str
anded
, jeff waves down a passing truck driver
( j
. t
. walsh
) who offers to take them to a nearby diner to call for a tow truck
. because of a nasty incident earlier with a couple of ruffians
, jeff decides to stay with thte car while amy gets help
. that
, it seems
, is the last time jeff
( or anyone esle
) sees her
. breakdown has been compared to several movies
: george sluizer
' s the vanishing
( the original
, hopefully
, not his appalling hollywood remake
)
, steven spielberg
' s duel
and any number of hitchcock films
. as with these
, breakdown does not
, for the most part
, stray down the conventional path of the american action
- thriller
. jeff does not become a gun
- toting vigilante on tjhe hunt for his wife
,
but instead becomes a scared
, confused everyman who has no idea what the hell is going on
. when we dont find out what has happened to amy
, it does come as a slight disappointment
, if only because it
' s too early in the film
; i for oney coudl have done with an extra twenty minutes or so of mystery
and bewilderment
,
but this affects the film little
. russell
, as mentioned earlier
, isnt very good in his role
,
and kathleen quinlan is nowhere near as annoying as she was in apollo 13
. j
. t
. walsh
, as the possibly evil truck driver
, is terrific
; he is one of tyhe best of the fine batch of character actors hollywood doesn
' t seem to konw whta tothe do with
,
but director jonathan mostow is on the right track here
. the reason he makes such a gerat villain is that he actually looks like a real person
, one anyone would be able to trust
, which makes the plot that much omre believable
. breakdown is what hollywood doesn
' t make enough of
, a great thriller iwth believable cahracters
and scenes that do
, indeed
, have viewers on the edge of their seats
. one ofthe thge most genuinely exciting films i
' ve seen in a long time
.
