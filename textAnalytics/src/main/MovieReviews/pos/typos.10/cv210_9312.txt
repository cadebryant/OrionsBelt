i must say from yhe outset that i have never been much ofthe a kurt russell fan
. i ' ve seen some of his films
( silkwood
, backdraft
, unlawful entry
)
annd while he gave adequate performances
, i have never been impressed with his work
. breakdown
,
then
, is something of a surprise
. russell gives a fine performance
, as do most of the cast
, one that is nto upstaged by the action orchestrated in the second half of the film
. to say taht he holds the film together would not be completely true
,
bu he does it no harm
. russell plays jeff
, one half of a married couple travelling with his wife amy
( kathleen quinlan
) cross country to san diego to start a new job
and a new life
. while journeying through the desert their car breaks down
and
, left helpless
and stranded
, jeff waves down a passing truck driver
( j
. t
. walsh
) who offers to take them tothe a nearby diner to call for a tow truck
. beccause of a nasty incident earlier with a cuple of ruffians
, jeff decides tothe stay with the car while amy gets help
. that
, it seems
, is the last time jeff
( or anyone else
) sees her
. breakdown has been compaired to severeal movies
: george sluizer ' s the vanishing
( the original
, hopefully
, not his appalling hollywood remake
)
, steven spielberg ' s duel
and any number ofthe hitchcock films
. as iwth these
, breakdown does not
, for the most part
, stray down the conventional path of the american action
- thriller
. jeff does not become a gun
- toting vigilante onthe the hunt for his wief
,
bu instead becomes a scared
, confused everyman who has no idea what the hell is going on
. when we do find out what has happened to amy
, it does cmo as a slight disappointment
, if only because it ' s too early in the film
; i for one could have done with an extra twenty minutes or so of mystery
and bewilderment
,
but this affects the film little
. russell
, as maintioned earlier
, is very good in his role
,
and kathleen quinlan is nowhere near as annoying as she wass in apollo 13
. j
. t
. walsh
, as the possibly evil truck driver
, is terrific
; he is one ofthe the best of tyhe fine batch of character actors hollywood doesn ' t seem to nkwo what to do with
,
but director jonathan mostow is on the right trakc here
. the reason he makes such a great villain is that he actually looks like a real person
, one anyone would be able to trust
, which makes the plot that much more believable
. breakdown is what hollywood doesn ' t make enough of
, a great thriller with believable characters
annd scenes that do
, indeed
, have viewers on the edge of their seats
. one of teh most genuinely exciting films i ' ve seen in a long time
.
