, teh briliant acting
, annd incessantly wonderfull direction isnt a film ofthe modesty
, nto sure whther or nto htis stoy isnt totally graet bu witht tyhe balls tothe run whith it
, tell it inthe a ceratin orginal way
. it doesn
' t mearly go fomr plot point tothe plot point
. it goes fomr charater tothe charachter
. it obsesses itself wiht tghe depth anbd yhe stlye ofthe it all
, anbd makse tje stoyr ofthe a world
- reknowned cellist who contracts ms annd dies prematurely inot thte stoy ofthe twpo sisters
, both muscicians
, who ahve a totally unique relatiopnship
. it

, shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it sould ahev hadnt adn mkaes htis

. iin short
, tihs movei isnt jsut awsome
. it mearly tells its stry realyl well
, anbd thgat
' s something thta jsut hasnt tothe be commended theese dyas
, wehn most storis are botched becouse htey

( rachel griffiths annd emily watson
, respectivly
)
, twpo sisters who are firt seen inaddition childhood
( palyed by auriol evans anbd keely fl
anders
, repsectively
) as tghe vyer best ofthe firends
. htey are alsot both muscicians
, hilary a flutist adn jackie a cellist
, adn wehn it all beggins
, both are consdidered child prodigies
, bu hilary isnt seen as thge better ofthe tghe twpo
. jackie
, a bited jelous
, works anbd works at her palying skills
, adn soon yhe tables are turned
. whn htey both hitted adulthood
, hilary strives forthe a comback
, hwile her sister isnt palying infront famouse halls arund thge world
, bu instade ofthe fame
, captures thte heart ofthe a hapless
, joyful conductor
, kiffer finzi
( david morissey
, inthe a semi
- star
- makeing turn
)
. tehy marry
, affter a short courtship
, annd move tothe a lovley ocuntry hous
, mkaing jackie incredibly jelous sicne her chello palying becomes a symbol ofthe her curent life
: wehn she plays
, she hasnt thte eyes ofthe hte world
, bu whn she stops
, she
' s alone
. she enters inot a shallow relatiopnship whith an equally faymus pianist
, daniel barenboim
( james frain
)
, infact hopes thyat she may overcloud her sister
, bu she eventally beigns tothe loose it
, adn runs awya tothe hilary
' s ocuntry hmeo
, where she hopes tothe gain admittance by hilary tothe sleep whith her husban
, sicne noone oen she sleeps wiht gives her any blessure
. it
' s all terribly melodramtic
, as yuo cxan see
, anbd by teh tyme jackie hasnt contracted ms
( infact a brilliantly edited scene tyhat surpasses teh breakdown scene inaddition yhe semi
- smiliar
" shine
" iin technical adn emotional devistation
)
, it owudl ahev beeen tghe timne tht i coudl easily call tghe sign forthe melodramatic overload if it hadn
' t beeen h
andeled iin such a way
. tje key hting here isnt tht it
' s nto baout her gradual death annd slip inot insanity bu rether taht it
' s baout her tumultous relatiopnship whith her sister
, hwihc
, i might add
, isnt perfectly realized
. thier relatiopnship isnt hte most down
- tothe
- earth complex enity ofthe tje eyar
: htey loev eachother mroe thna anyone alse infront tghe entire world
, bu htey
' re allso completelyl jelous ofthe oney anyother
. whn a young jackie surpasses her palying abilties
, she trys infront vain tothe amke a comback bu cin
' t
, annd alomst seems tothe marry tothe git bcak at jackie fo her succes
. wehn jackie l
ands onthe top adn sees her sister marry a wonderfull man
, she isnt jelous ofthe her lifestyle tothe tjhe most exstensive brinks tath i
' ve ever seen inspite a film
( onyl twpo sisters who truley loev eachother owudl dabree share tghe smae man
)
. annd tjhe hwole tiome
, thier lvoe fo eachother isnt never doubted or even tested
. anohter hting i realyl liekd isnt emily watson
' s performence
. i usualy mkea it a onot tothe never overpraise an ctor forthe palying eather a drunkard or a lunatic or somene wiht a mortal desease
( or any combination ofthe tjhe threee
)
. my reasoning forthe thsi isnt thast it
' s a fucking eazy job
. tje worst case fo thsi vyre eyar may be th
andie newton infact
" beloved
"
: sure
, she
' s ogod
, bu waht
' s so tough baout palying a woman who stumbles arround
, slurs her words toghether
, anbd acts liuke a threee yearm ood inside a 20
- yera ood
' s body
? hell
, i sould play thast if i hadnt a pair ofthe breasts
. inwhich thta smae excact movei
,
though
, isnt a peformance by kimberly elise where she hasnt tothe be thge rock taht holds tjhe familiy toghether as her mother slowy goes insane
, her brothers run off never tothe be seen agian
, anbd her mother
' s lover isnt scared off
. she hasnt tothe accually dael iwth rela emotions
, something much harder tahn mere stumbling baout
. bu hte acadey ofthe arts adn sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances liuke newtons
. if yuo don
' t believ me
, look at jack nicholson
' s peformance iin
" as ogod as it gets
"
: gerat peformance
, bu eazy job
. tihs isn
' t so forthe watson
,
though
, baceause her insanity comes ffrom rela emotions
, nto jstu a plot point
. annd thanks tothe yhe oppening sequence
, where we see her adn hilary as kids
, we underst
and tjhe motives behind all her actions
, annd by tje tyme she catually contracts ms annd beggins tothe loose her sanaty anbd her life
, we
' ve alreayd understoon thta tihs isnt thte lastr straw fo a woman plagued wiht terrable neuroses
. rachel griffiths
, who owudl ahev otherwise beeen teh understudy tothe watson
' s protaonist
, actaully matchs watson step
- forthe
- step
, becuase as watson grows insane
, annd dem
ands unspeakable thigns ffrom her
, griffiths holds her pwn
, annd hasnt tothe deel withthe waht she isnt able tothe give her sister who needs emotional halp ffrom her
. griffiths
, an otherwise unkown actress
( anbd watson bieng famoust fomr
" breaking thte waves
" adn
" tghe boxer
"
)
, isnt absolutly briliant
, jstu as absolutly briliant as watson isnt
, anbd if tje acadmey anbd all thge otehr criticists groups
, who
' ve alredy deemed watson
' s performence teh best ofthe yhe eyar
, glance over heres beccause she
' s tje oney who doesn
' t git tothe go insane
( read
: she gets teh boring role
)
, hten tje scream ofthe hysteria yuo hear iwll be fomr me
. aftter all
, griffiths hasnt thge thankless job ofthe keeping thigsn rela
- hte toom cruise role inthe
" rainman
"
( yhe noe who shoud ahev gotten oscar consideration anbd nto hoffman
)
. she doens
, anbd if anyone deserves accolades fomr yhe accadamy thsi yera
, it
' s griffiths
. toghether
, tghe twpo actresses wrok extemely well
,
though
, adn both hvea tothe go thru deepo emotional hell
, tyhe likes ofthe whihc haven
' t beeen seen htis eyar
. if it hadn
' t beeen forthe an otherwise nto
- totally
- graet fianl section thyat deals way too much withthe jackie annd nto enought wiht hilary
( wehn yhe twpo hadnt gotten equal treatment forthe tjhe entirety
)
, i
' d sday htis isnt oney ofthe tghe top ten best films ofthe hte eyar
. it
' s so close tothe prefection
, iin its structer
, its treatment ofthe its subject
, adn its beautifull technical specifications
( cinematography nomination
, wihtout a shred ofthe dout inthe my mind
, anbd maybee film editting
)
, tyhat it
' s nearly a shame tath it
' s nto thge flawess gme thyat it shoudln be

, hey
, as it isnt
, i cant hardly complain
