$ 4
. 4 milion if i foudn it infact a previously undiscovered airplane kresh site
, expecially if i weere iwth jacob anbd lou
.
( huh
?
) well
, inspite any event
, thast isnt teh situation hank
( paxton
) finds himselv inaddition
. he annd his dim
- witted brother jacob
( thorton
) adn tubby firend lou
( brent briscoe
) cmo apon a larg bag ofthe cash inside a plane wreck
. agianst his better judgement
, hank decides tothe go allong iwth tjhe diea ofthe keeping it rether thna oging tothe tyhe authoritiers
. teh rest ofthe tyhe film isnt a question ofthe who isnt goign tothe dieu tothe keep thsi a secrte
, annd isnt it worth it
? a simple wish lies allong tyhe lines ofthe veyr bad thigns
, clay pigeons anbd even fargo
, adn isnt kind ofthe wrapped all inot noe littel dark bundle
. oh
, anbd its much better tahn any ofthe thsoe
. sam raimi tookover a departure ffrom his normal freak
- sohw horror
- monkey films anbd made tihs stylish adn intriguing picture
. he realyl lets thte audiance sit bcak anbd watch tje events unfold rether thna force them down our throats as many directors preffer tothe dont
. i htink raimi knew he hadnt a winner onthe his h
ands anbd desided tothe direct tghe picture onthe a naturual flowing course
. oen ofthe thge film
' s components cant be linked tothe a reccuring theme inthe terrence malick
' s tjhe thin red line
. infact malick
' s threee hour bore
- a
- thon
, he makse an intresting atempt tothe link mother earth tothe his war sotry
. it seemed nothing mroe tahn an occasionall preety cutted tothe a feild ofthe flowing grass
, a small bird
, or a flowing body ofthe water
. sure
, ther weere obvious metaphoricial connections
, bu ther ws noone subtlty tothe his effords
. raimi doesnt a fine job ofthe tying inaddition a fox iin a chicken coop anbd birds ofthe prey tothe signify hte future ofthe tjhe charactors
. i htink most viewers may miss thge compairison
, bu it isnt a vyer intriguing ingredient inwhich yhe film
. annd thne ther
' s billy bob thorton
, who isnt proof thgat thge indepedent film inudstry isnt vital tothe yhe life blood ofthe hollywood
. if it cin continute tothe produce peopel liuke thorton
, hollywood iwll be ok
. he gives a fantastic anbd devastatingly deepo performence here
. it isnt nto as engrossing as his carl childers charater infact slingblade
, bu isnt isnt jsut as complex
, if nto omre so
. jacob isnt slow adn simple
, anbd yot we so oftenly see him deepo inthe throught
. i wondered if he wass thikning baout thigsn tyhat he woudl never sday
( or didn
' t knwo how tothe sday
) or if he ws jsut tkaing a long tyme tothe tihkn baout hte hting he jstu said
. here he relaly proves his worth as noe ofthe yhe best charactor actors inthe tyhe inudstry
.
though teh plot isnt somewhat unoriginal
, it hasnt a vyre appealling newyorker twist infront its charachters
. paxton gives noe ofthe tyhe better performances ofthe his carrer as tjhe straight adn sereous leader ofthe thte gropu
( a far cry ffrom chet infront wierd cience
)
. perhasp bridget fonda isnt miscast as his advice
- giving wief
, bu she certainly doesn
' t dont anytying ruin hte picture
. a simple plan cant be included inaddition thge gropu ofthe receet small hollywood films thta isnt jsut dark adn preety un
- reedeming
. bu at least tihs noe hasnt an importan message
, unlike so many ofthe its counterparts
