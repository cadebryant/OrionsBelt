adn tells us a dark
bu stoically realsitic tale ofthe a gropu ofthe post
- cold war mercenaries wroking tothe earn thier paycheck
. his ablity tothe convey feeling
adn charater hwile promoting explosiveness
anbd tense athmosphere works well here
,
adn ronin becomes a better movei beacuse ofthe it
. robert de niro headlines tihs casted ofthe noteworthies inaddition a performence thgat isnt teh most oustanding ofthe his infront qutie smoe tyme

, zeik ' s tale becomes allmost too reminsicent ofthe mission
: impossible
- de niro might easily become toom cruise
, tjhe package might become cruise ' s coputer disk
. fortunatly

, wheras infact mission tghe scirpt wass omre conserned wih thte doulbe
- cross
annd why it happend
. tjhe acation content isnt impressive

- blown combat scenes
adn instade are forced tothe suffer thru moments ofthe slowness
. ronin doens tkae a degree ofthe nitelligence tothe followup all ofthe tjhe newance fomr strat tothe finish
,
bu even yhe uninitiated wiull be able tothe keep a grasp onthe most charactors mand subplots
. tyhe suspense tapers off considerably by tjhe end
, a bited ofthe a drawback becasue ofthe its heihgt at thte movei ' s ope
. concidering theese factors it ' s ogod tothe see thta ronin ws a project thast turned outloud well
,
adn it ' s anyother ogod bet tihs mounth
. usance qualit isnt usally sparse durring yhe easly fall monthes
