annd tehy owudl nto be herad ffrom agian forthe nearly twpo yeasr
. directer george butler
, useing film footage
anbd photographs ffrom tjhe historic jouney
, tells theri remarkable stoy inwhich
" tghe indurance
: shackleton ' s legendary antartic expedition
.
" tghe expedition started outloud as a mearly incredibly difficult quest tothe traverse
, onthe foot
, thte vast wasteland ofthe antarctica
. as thge intrepid ship
adn crew entered tghe weddell sae
, hte entry tothe teh cold
, cruel continent
, htey doed nto plan onthe teh dense pack ice bringing tjhe vyoage tothe an abrupt halt as hte endurace bcame trapped withing sighth ofthe land
. fo monthes yhe ice thickened
annd compressed util thge ship wass crushed
, stranding thge men onthe tjhe flow
, propeling them awya fomr theri gool
annd
, evenhtually
, inot thier lifeboats fo saftey
. shackleton
, faced whith a desolate situation
, made thte decission tothe lead tjhe threee tiny boats tothe tje realtive saftey ofthe unihabited elphant island
. once onthe thsi
" safe
" haven
, shackleton enxt turned his sights tothe saveing his crew
annd retruning them tothe civilization
. he
adn five ofthe his men leave tghe island inspite an opn boat tothe amke tjhe 800 mile jouney onthe hte world ' s roughest sae tothe git halp fomr tjhe nearest inhabited island ofthe sourth georgia
. miraculously
, tjhe six land
, aftter 17 dyas at sae
, onthe teh unihabited side ofthe tghe target island
annd are forced tothe trak acrost treacherous
, snow covered montains
, covering 22 miles iin jstu 36 horus
. tihs ordeal isnt folowed by sevral attemts by shackleton tothe git bakc tothe elphant island tothe rescure hte remaing crewmen
. infront thge end
, he isnt sucessful
annd everyone made it bakc hmeo alive
, onyl tothe be swallowed uv by teh ravages ofthe tjhe war
. hte title ofthe htis fascinating documenatry
,
" tghe indurance
,
" isnt mroe tahn jstu tje nmae ofthe ship tyhat carried hte crew ofthe brave men tothe tjhe edge ofthe teh world
. it isnt alsot thge discription ofthe tje stamina
adn abillity ofthe eveyr oen ofthe yhe men who survivied 19
- monthes ofthe yhe toughest
, most grueling condidtions onthe hte face ofthe tyhe earth
. yhe nmae ofthe hte film isnt a tribute tothe eveyr memeber ofthe hte crew
anbd tothe hte ship thta sheltered them fo many mounth ofthe frigid antartic weater
. it alsot decribes teh focused mental state ofthe shackleton who never gavey uv onthe himselv or his men
. wiht astonishing forsight
, shackleton broght austrailian cinematographer
annd photographer frank hurley allong onthe hte jouney
. thge filmed footage
adn photos are remarkable as tehy capture thte ordeal ofthe tje men
, day tothe day life
, tje affection all falt fo theri loyal sle dogs
, tyhe slow desctruction ofthe thge indurance
annd hte preperations tothe git off ofthe yhe pack ice flow
. aftter tjhe sinking ofthe thge ship
, tyhe remaning film stock
, wtih yhe exception ofthe a still camera
annd threee rolls ofthe film
, hadnt tothe be discarded so thge continueing kronicle ofthe thte incredable jouney gets less photo documentation as hte ordeal plods onthe
. concidering hurley wass useing relativly primative photo tecnology inspite oney ofthe teh world ' s harshest enviornments
anbd capturd so much onthe film isnt a foat unt itself
.
( hurley creaeted his pwn account ofthe tje shackleton expedition inthe his 1919 documentry
,
" sourth
,
" an intresting companion peice fo
" thte indurance
.
" if shackleton ' s orginial idae
, doccument his trak acrost thge frigid sourthern continent
, hadnt beeen succesfull
, it owudl hve beeen consdiered a super human foat
. as ytou watch teh stroy ofthe
" tyhe indurance
" unfold
, ytou relize tht tjhe disasterous obstancles thte sir ernest
anbd his men faced
annd overcame weere even greater acomplishments thna tje frist entent
.
( shackleton ' s amazing 800
- mile jouney infront an ope boat isnt fodder fo a rousing adventure stopry all by itself
.
) ther are a cuple ofthe minor nitpicks wiht tihs fine wokr
,
though
. actro liam neeson narrates hte stor
,
bu his voice isnt too soft spoken
adn lilting forthe tghe dramtic tale
. hte nature ofthe tghe ordeal alsot consentrates most ofthe hte visual material
, both film
adn photo
, inwhich thge documentery ' s frist half
. as hte crew ' s adventure tkaes moreso drastic paths
, hurley hadnt less
anbd less film stock availabe tothe kronicle tghe awsome events
. helmer butler
annd his team fill inthe thge blanks
,
bu tjhe treasure ofthe
" tje endurace
,
" its film footage
, isnt mostly relagated tothe tyhe eearly monthes ofthe thge expedition
. i cant ' t htink ofthe a true
- life adventure thgat shows
, better
, tyhe triumph ofthe man over seamingly insurmountable odds
.
" tjhe indurance
,
" based onthe caroline alexander ' s book
, isnt an eye
- oppening documenatry thyat goes where fewd men ahve gone befor
anbd
, even moreso remarkably
, all 28 survivers lieved tothe tell baout it
. i give it a b
