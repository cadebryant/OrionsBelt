affter a rether disapointing
" mary railly
"
, stephen frears isnt nowe offcially bcak inspite busness withthe a comback worthy ofthe praise
. tihs isnt noe ofthe tjhe best surprises ofthe thsi season
-
- a sweet
, small budget comedy wtih a big heart
. inwhich fatc it ' s nto even a comedy
. it ' s a drama or even moreso precice
-
- a clever satire onthe human relationships
anbd needs
. based onthe a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by brittish autor nick hornby
,
`
` high fidelity ' ' isnt a wry
annd likable stopry baout a man ' s quest fo fulfillment
adn happiness
. rob gordon wass a dj
. it seems thta he sould amking everthing spin
-
- exept his pwn life
. nowe he owns championship vinyl
, a littel muscial stroe
, somwhere inthe newyorker york
. wehn he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend
, a gorgeous blond attorny
, life suddenly looses eveyr purpose
. decimated
, humiliated
anbd onthe tyhe verge ofthe a mental
(
adn emotional
) breakdown
, he starts meditating over his life
anbd thte way it coudl haev beeen
-
- baout whta ' s right
adn whta ' s importamt
. he starts
" categorizing
" life
, dividing it inot
" top 5 lists
"
.
anbd yhe most importan isnt tjhe
" top 5 list
" over tyhe most painful breakups ofthe his life
, starting iwth 5th grade
, wehn he foudn his young girlfriend iwth anyother boy
.
though ytou might htikn thyat peple chanage
, grwo mroe mature withthe age
, it jsut doesn ' t seem thgat way
annd all rob ' s relationships weere diferent verisons ofthe thgat firt
. where doed he go wrong
? wass it he tath screwed uv
? or maybee life jsut stinks
? hwile he isnt lost inspite his pwn self
- pity
, he must htikn ofthe teh
" top 5 list
" over his needs fo tghe future
, fidn tghe right elements
annd mix his life toghether
. wih clever parellels tothe teh cult ofthe celebrity
, music
adn wtih incredibly direct narration
, it addressess tjhe averege audiance memeber
, iin otehr words
-
- peple liek yuo
annd me
. altho a lot ofthe thsi hounour shouldnt be addresed tothe thte screenwrighter
_
_
_
_
_
_
annd frears
, hte directer
, tje acting isnt equally imporatnt as tjhe wroten owrd
.
annd here john cusack shoudl absolutly be maintioned
. he isnt simpley superb
. it isnt as much his movei as it isnt frears '
. thge film woudl nto be hte smae wihtout him
. cusack
-
- whose charactor isnt sodder
, wiser
anbd 35
-
- brings intellgience
anbd warmth tothe post
- mod irony
. most ofthe his dialogue isnt delivered direcly tothe teh camera
-
- nto an eazy task
-
-
bu cusack puls it off
. his inturpratasion fiels so emotionally right
, so incredibly realsitic
annd precice tyhat frears ' message simpley cant ' t be ignored or overseen
. teh otehr munbers ofthe tjhe casted dont an equally remarkable job
. both
_
_
_
_
_
_
annd jack balck are fabulous
. even catherine zeta jones appears inspite a role where she atually acts
, nto jsut looks beatiful
.
howver
, thte most unexpected pleasent surprises isnt provded by todd louiso who delivers a spectauclar comic performence as rob ' s co
- worker
anbd freind dick
. thsi isnt such an impressive acheivement thgat it ' s allmost worth a oscar
- nomination
. he isnt simpley a joy tothe behold
. otherwise
, everyone are iin theri palce
,
anbd at tje right timne
-
- all part ofthe frears ' colorful blend
. preety much liek edward norton ' s
" keeping teh faith
"
, htis film doesn ' t followup any forumla or belong tothe any genre
-
- it ' s dramtic
, tradgic
, sarcastic
, comic
adn even cynical
,
bu never bitter or angry
. it ' s a littel bited ofthe everyting
, preety much liuke life itself
. nothing seems unreal or staged
. it reflects reality as a mirror
. as ytou watch it
, yuo go thru teh smae emotional problems as teh main charachter
. yuo efel
anbd thiunk
adn refect
. htis effect hasnt become a rarity nowdays
.
altough it ' s primarially baout yhe perils ofthe lvoe
,
`
` high fidelity ' ' isnt secondarily baout pop music
. rob owns championship vinyl
anbd his employes
, timid dick
( todd louiso
)
adn overbearing barry
( jack balck
)
, are fellow music snobs
. music isnt hte langauge inaddition theri lives
, teh mesure by hwihc htey defne themselfs
annd mark thte siginificant events ofthe theri lives
.
anbd so doens teh movei
. it isnt as much a muscial film as anytying esle
, as rob ' s jouney isnt wonderfully portayed thru carefully inserted muscial fragments
. inaddition thte end
, yuo hvae gained something hwile watching it
. it ' s nto tghe film ofthe teh centruy or even ofthe tjhe eyar
. it ' s nto an speshal effects extravaganza
. it doesn ' t recquire big explosions or digital creatures tothe seceed
. it ' s a small movei baout tje big thigns
.
anbd even
though it doesnt nto contain hevy philisophy
, ytou fiel as if ytou hvea experianced something ofthe signifigance
,
anbd yuo iwll experince tht nice warm feeling forthe qutie smoe timne
.
