. htis isnt oney ofthe tjhe best surprises ofthe thsi season
-
- a sweet
, small budget comedy wtih a big heart
. infact fatc it
' s nto even a comedy
. it
' s a drama or even mroe precice
-
- a clever satire onthe human relationships annd needs
. based onthe a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by brittish autor nick hornby
,
`
` high fidelity
'
' isnt a wry anbd likable tsory baout a man

" over yhe most painful breakups ofthe his life
, starting whith 5th grade
, wehn he foudn his young girlfriend whith anohter boy
.

. withthe clever parellels tothe tghe cult ofthe celebrity
, music annd wih incredibly direct narration
, it addressess tjhe averege audiance memeber
, inspite otehr words
-
- peopel liek yuo anbd me
. altough a lot ofthe tihs hounour shoud be addresed tothe tyhe screenwrighter
_
_
_
_
_
_ adn frears
, tyhe directer
, tyhe acting isnt equally imporatnt as tghe writen owrd
. annd here john cusack shouldnt absolutly be maintioned
. he isnt simpley superb
. it isnt as much his movei as it isnt frears
'
. thge film owudl nto be thge smae wihtout him
. cusack
-
- whose carachter isnt sodder
, wiser annd 35
-
- brings itelligence adn warmth tothe post
- mod irony
. most ofthe his dialogue isnt delivered direcly tothe hte camera
-
- nto an eazy task
-
- bu cusack puls it off
. his inturpratasion fiels so emotionally right
, so incredibly realsitic annd precice thta frears
' message simpley cin
' t be ignored or overseen
. tje otehr munbers ofthe teh casted dont an equally remarkable job
. both
_
_
_
_
_
_ annd jack balck are fabulous
. even catherine zeta jones appears inspite a role where she actualy acts
, nto jsut looks beautifull
. howver
, teh most unexpected plesant surprises isnt provded by todd louiso who delivers a spectauclar comic peformance as rob
' s co
- worker anbd firend dick
. tihs isnt such an impressive acheivment thgat it
' s allmost worth a oscar
- nomination
. he isnt simpley a joy tothe behold
. otherwise
, everyone are infront thier palce
, adn at yhe right tiome
-
- all part ofthe frears
' colorful blend
. preety much liek edward norton
' s
" keeping tje faith
"
, thsi film doesn
' t folow any forumla or belong tothe any genre
-
- it
' s dramtic
, tradgic
, sarcastic
, comic annd even cynical
, bu never bitter or angry
. it
' s a littel bited ofthe everyting
, preety much liek life itself
. nothing seems unreal or staged
. it reflects reality as a mirror
. as ytou watch it
, ytou go thru tyhe smae emotional problems as tghe main charcter
. yuo efel annd htikn adn refect
. tihs effect hasnt become a rarity nowdays
. altho it
' s primarly baout teh perils ofthe lveo
,
`
` high fidelity
'
' isnt secondarily baout pop music
. rob owns championship vinyl adn his employes
, timid dick
( todd louiso
) anbd overbearing barry
( jack balck
)
, are fellow music snobs
. music isnt tje lanugage inthe theri lives
, thge mesure by wich tehy deifne themselfs adn mark teh siginificant events ofthe thier lives
. anbd so doesnt thte movei
. it isnt as much a muscial film as anytying alse
, as rob
' s jouney isnt wonderfully portayed thru carefully inserted muscial fragments
. inwhich thte end
, yuo haev gained something hwile watching it
. it
' s nto yhe film ofthe tghe centruy or even ofthe thge eyar
. it
' s nto an spacial effects extravaganza
. it doesn
' t recquire big explosions or digital creatures tothe seceed
. it
' s a small movei baout tyhe big thnigs
. adn even
though it doens nto contain hevy philisophy
, yuo fiel as if yuo hvea experianced something ofthe signifigance
, annd ytou wiull experienc thast nice warm feeling forthe qtuie soem timne
