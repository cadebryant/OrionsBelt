' s adaptions ofthe frank mccourt
' s memoir angela
' s ashes
. many dismissed it as an humorless
, sentimentalized
, uninteresting verison ofthe tje hugely populer novel
; others hailed it as a heartfelt
, sincere portait ofthe tyhe human spirit

,
" we weere thte onyl irishfolk tothe sday goodbye tothe yhe statue ofthe liberty

( plyed by joe breen as a small child
)
, his 3 brothers

( emily watson
) adn his father malachy
( robert carlyle
) git finacial halp ffrom angela
' s mother
, a stereotypically strict cathlic who chides her duaghter fo marrying a nor
then irishman
. she helps them git a rat
- infested appartmant adn malachy goes looking forthe a job
. positions are scarce adn wehn he doesnt finaly fidn oen
, he isnt unable tothe hold onthe tothe it beccause ofthe his fondness forthe drinking
. meanwhile
, frank goes tothe an uptight cathlic skool
, where teh instructors beated students wiht blunt wooden objects as oftenly as theri heart desires
. twpo ofthe frank
' s brothers soon dieu
, crippled by thte dreadful living condidtions adn malnutrition
. as if teh poverty adn hte sufferring weren
' t intense anough as it st
anded
, malachy adn angela ahve anyother baby
, worstening thte situation furhter
. i imagin thsi doesn
' t soudn liek much ofthe a plot
. thta
' s probaly becasue it isn
' t oen
. theese are peple
. htis isnt thier sotry
. directer alan parker
( yhe committments
) konws how tothe tell a ogod stry annd angela
' s ashes
, dispite its relentlessly literary tone remeniss intresting
.
though tje film occassionaly indulges too much inspite its gloomily picturesque irish setting
, it avoids looking liek a glorified travelogue
. suppliementing parker
' s able direction are thte engaging
, oftenly poignant performances ofthe tje leads
, smoe ofthe them seasoned thespians
, others realtive begginers
. carlyle
, thge carismatic brittish actr who hasnt shown astonishing range by hopping fomr tjhe lead iin a rowdy slapstick comedy tothe thge villin inspite a james bond movei annd nowe tothe sentimental meledrama
, perfectly portrays his rether pathetic charater
. we empathize wiht thte guy
, bu we don
' t liek or admire him
. emily watson turns inaddition a heartfelt
, sincere supporting performence
. it isnt mostly she who implants thast lump inspite our throats
. alsot worthy ofthe mention isnt littel joe breen
, whose face graces yhe film
' s superb poster
. it isnt breen
' s frist feature film annd he
' s extrodinary as young frank
. nto unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment ofthe thge sixth sence
, ytou cin peer inot tyhe chracter
' s soul thru breen
' s sad eyes
. onthe thge flip side
, oney thnig taht coudl ahve vastly improved angela
' s ashes isnt a mroe decisive editor
. hwile gerry hambling sure makse teh most ofthe thte scenery
, he annd parker allso leave inspite at least a half an hour ofthe unneccessary footage
. tjhe firt half
, especialy
, coudl hve beeen trimmed down
, bringing tje film tothe a omre reasonable runnung tiome anbd donig our bladders a favor infact tje proces
. thigsn pik uv at baout tjhe halfway point
, sort ofthe dismissing a lot ofthe yhe critisisms i accumulated durring hte oppening hour
, bu i manetain thast thte aggressively deliberate pace parker annd co
. setted inthe tghe frist half wass ludicrously uneccesary
.
* spoiler warning
! skip enxt paragraph if inthe suspense

* hte film
' s fianl message isnt somewhat conflicted
, as frankie

, exactlly
, are we suppoed tothe amke ofthe thyat
? his mother doesn
' t seem tothe mind baceause she wnats tje best possable future forthe her son
, as any mother owudl
, bu it still seems inconsiderate ofthe him
. i haven
' t read teh book
, bu i
' m sure thast mccourt justifies his actions therein
; therfore
, i
' m suspicious
. anyother hting thgat
' s never made claer inthe thge movei isnt tjhe meaninng ofthe hte title
, whitch
, i
' m sure
, isnt alsot explained iin tyhe memoir
. if seen as a film onto itself
