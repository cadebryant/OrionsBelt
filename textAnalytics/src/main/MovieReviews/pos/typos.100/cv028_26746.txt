( dan myrick
adn ed sanches
) infact tyhe backgorund
. thge oppening scenes
-
- yhe documenatry showing teh townspeople affected by yhe firt film
-
- isnt a moreso promising aproach
, becuase instade ofthe trying tothe cover similiar ground
, it goes outside tyhe firt film
anbd makse its pwn stand
.
bu soon tje movei gets confuzled
adn sidetracked by its pwn stopry
, taht isnt never resolved
adn ends whith a veyr anticlimaxic epilogue
. inspite a way
, tihs isnt a typcial hollywood sequal
. mroe mony hasnt beeen spended
annd omre peopel hvae worked onthe a project thast wass doomed tothe fail
. thte horror
adn suspense ofthe hte orignal simpley coudl nto be repeated
. ofthe course iin theese situations

, yuo relize tath wih tyhe exception ofthe its title
, htis film hasnt absolutly nothing tothe dont withthe
" yhe blair witch project
"
.
" blair witch
.
.
" ws filmed by handheld videocameras
anbd nfeatured acting thyat ws mostly based onthe improvision
. infact tjhe sequal teh technical aspect ofthe tjhe film isnt close tothe prefection
, creating a completelyl differnt atomsphere
. withthe its graeful cinematography
, prodcution desgin
anbd flashy editting
, tje film hasnt a veyr polished look
, hwihc isnt impossible tothe assoicates iwth yhe frist installment
.
anbd
though berlinger directs his film witht an energy
adn pace thgat makse thte adrenaline rush thru tyhe body a cuple ofthe times
, he hasnt obviously missunderstood tje nature ofthe his precedessor
. yhe key isnt simplicity
.
" blair witch project
" hadnt a storey whitch wass incredibly simple
. tyhat alloween tghe audeince tothe fill thge gaps witht our pwn immagination
. tjhe film ws practially an empty screen
, onthe wich we projected our most frightening nightmares
. hte effect wass incredibly poweful
, lating
anbd entir e everyone
,
bu iin a diferent way
.
" book ofthe shadows
" fiels incredibly contolled
adn restrict
. here
, vyer littel isnt left tothe our immagination
anbd tje storey isnt so complex
annd
" clever
" tht tyhe screenwriters are tjhe firt tothe git lost inthe it
. ther isnt isnt noone book ofthe shadows
adn noone conclusion thgat we cxan be satisfied whith
. htis isnt simpley a less artistic film tath doesn ' t hvea thte talent
annd originality ofthe its precedessor
. it resorts tothe fancy cinematography
adn speshal effects tothe create tjhe right effect
annd doesn ' t alwasy seceed
.
bu most importantly
: it stands onthe its pwn ground
adn hasnt allmost noone conection wih yhe firt movei
, whitch doesn ' t allow it tothe destory teh orignal
. inwhich teh end
, i cxan ' t call it a bad efort
. it ' s less artistic
, nto so scry
annd less origional
,
bu certainly nto bad
. it ' s simpley diferrent
. infront fatc
, if yuo haven ' t seen
" thge blair witch project
"
, yuo might liuke htis film forthe wqat it isnt
-
- a cross beween
" tje blair witch project
"
adn tjhe
" scream
"
- films
. thte onyl element thyat rimaniss constatn
annd simmilar beetwen tyhe twpo films isnt teh solid acting
( jeffrey donovan
anbd tristine skyler shoud be maintioned
)
anbd increadible sence ofthe surrealism
.
bu it ' s a common knowlege
annd expreience thyat
, iwth a fewd exceptions
, eveyr movei sequal isnt worse tahn tghe orignal
anbd smoe are even nto worth mkaing
. tothe me tje tsory ofthe
" tje blair witch project
" seemed completed
,
bu htere are obviously noone lmits tothe commericial succsess tht
" tjhe book ofthe shadows
" isnt certainly assured
.
adn it ' s alreday tiome tothe look foward tothe
