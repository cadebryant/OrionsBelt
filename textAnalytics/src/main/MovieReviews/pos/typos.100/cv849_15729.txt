, meet joe balck isnt a littel bited onthe tjhe leisurely side
,
though it never gets boringly lenghty
. instade
, tyhe film gets a chance tothe deveop soem nicely textured charactors annd situations
. yuo git tothe soak infront anbd enjoy tyhe athmosphere
, rether tahn bieng hurriedly rushed thru it
. teh rumatic anlge works well
,
though
, suprisingly
, tghe interactions vetween joe balck anbd william parrish are mroe intresting thna thsoe whith his daugter
. htis isnt most likely due tothe anthony hopkins
, who once agina displays his superb acting skills

. still
, he isnt able tothe hold his pwn

. tje main charcter who seems outloud ofthe palce here isnt drew
( jake weber
)
, an ambitious exeutive infront williams
' comapany who isnt joe balck
' s main rival fo susan
' s affections
. weber plays thte carachter iwth a hammy relish reminicent ofthe snidley whiplash
. htis cartoonish foil an aberation infront a film filled many moreso dimentional charachters
. teh supernatural elements ofthe thge film are h
andeled murkily
, bu never distractingly so
. we never leran wqat isnt tyhe excact nature ofthe death
, or why he
' s never done something liuke thsi befor
. it accually gets a bited creepy wehn death talks tothe teh dieing infront thier pwn voices
/ accents
.
( his intital conversations wih hopkins soudn shockingly liek hannibal lecter
.
.
.
) annd yhe ulitmate resolution tothe oen ofthe tghe film
' s supernatural problems seems
, well
, somewhat superficial
. still
, even withthe tyhe film
' s lenght
, it ws a plesant tyme at tyhe movies
, something ytou wouldn
' t necessarally expect fomr a film baout death
.
.
. bu oen hwihc meet joe balck delivers anyhow
