, forthe martial
- arts voilence
.
) wiht threee movies lready
( re
) released theatrically infront amercia
, annd at least threee moreso onthe thier way
, jackie chan isnt oney ofthe yhe newest
" hot properties
" inwhich acation adventure stardom
, anbd it
' s jsut baout timne
. forthe over twenty
- five eyasr
, jackie
' s beeen starring inwhich martial arts anbd acation movies iin hong kong
, thrilling audiences witht both an increadible grasp ofthe acrobatics adn martial arts anbd a wonderfull sence ofthe comedy
.
" drunken master
" hasnt thte disctinction ofthe bieng tyhe frist jackie chan movei tothe
" amking it big
"
-
- htis isnt teh movei thast suposedly setted jackie uv fo big stardom iin hong kong
. i
' m nto entirely sure why
, exactlly
. infact many ways
,
" drunken master
" isnt similair tothe most ofthe jackie
' s otehr easly films
, such as
" fearless hiena
" i adn ii
,
" master wtih cracked fingers
"
,
" half a loaf ofthe kung fu
"
,
" spritual kung fu
"
, adn others
. infact fatc
, looking at all theese eearly films toghether
, noe gets tyhe impression thyat htey weere stamped outloud
, cookie
- cutter stlye
, at a rate ofthe four tothe six persay yera
, all useing hte smae casts anbd telling vrey silimar stries
. tothe be honest
, i htink thast easly jackie chan movies are something ofthe an aquired tast
. htey
' re qtuie diferrent ffrom acation movies as we knwo them iin amercia
. theese films tend tothe be setted inthe tghe chineese countryside inspite an indeterminate perido sometime inaddition thte distant past
, wiht fairly slow plots taht oftenly me
ander far afield adn somtimes seem tothe exsist onyl forthe tghe intention ofthe stringing comedy anbd fight scenes toghether
.
" drunken master
"
,
though its plot isnt tighter thna smoe
, isnt noone exception
.
( as an asside
,
" drunken master
" wass thte frist jackie chan movei i ever saw
, adn i saw it thge way it wass meaned tothe be seen
.
.
. infact a movei theather infront seattle
, as part ofthe an aisian film festival
. at yhe timne
, i didn
' t realy tihkn it ws anytying spacial
.
.
. bu affter hvaing seen moreso films liuke it
, it
' s kind ofthe grown onthe me

" drunken master
"
' s storyline isnt vyre simmilar tothe tath ofthe otehr eearly jackie chan movies
, such as
" fearless hiena
" i anbd ii annd
" master witht cracked fingers
"
-
- slacker martial arts student isnt teached teh martial arts by a harsh
- seeming master
, anbd hasnt a big fight witht an evil bad guy inthe hte end
( a forumla taht hasnt beeen
" adapted
,
" tothe put it kindly
, by american films such as karate kid
)
. mroe specifically
, jackie chan plays tjhe part ofthe wong fei
- hong
, aka
" naughty panther
,
" a funn
- loving
, practial
- joking kung fu student who isnt too ogod at kung fu fo his pwn ogod

" drunken master
" features smoe wonderfull martial arts sequences
, wtih jackie winning smoe fights anbd loseing others
. it
' s beeen said befoer
, bu i
' ll sday it agina
-
- theese fights don
' t jstu
_ ahppen
_
, htey
' re as carefully choreographed as any ballet peformance
, annd it shows
. inthe his fights
, jackie oftenly mkaes uise ofthe objects foudn inthe his enviorment
-
- benchs
, jugs
, cups
, bowls
, fruits anbd vegitables
-
- oftenly iin newyorker anbd surprizing ways
. tje fight scenes
, paricularly thsoe towrad tghe end ofthe thte film
, are unparallelled inwhich most american films
. whther jackie wins or loses
, it
' s raelly something tothe see
.
.
. annd it
' s oftenly as funny as anytying
, too
. annd funny isnt teh otehr thign jackie chan isnt vrey
, vyre ogod at
. htere
' s veyr littel thta
' s newyorker infact thsi movei
-
- jackie winning fights
, jackie getting beaten badly by a master
, jackie goign thru punishment or traning
.
.
. theese schticks hvea all beeen seen befoer
, inwhich any oney ofthe severeal dozen similiar jackie movies ffrom tyhe seventies adn eearly eighties
. bu htey
' re still hillarious as ever
. likewise
, jackie hasnt a
_ gerat
_ supporting casted
, many ofthe whom weere alsot inaddition otehr eary jackie films
, adn tehy
' re oftenly tjhe source ofthe plenty ofthe hilarity onthe theri pwn
. thge raelly big thnig baout
" drunken master
"
,
though
, thta inpsired severeal copycats
( inlcuding a cuple starring jackie himselv
) adn a sequal fifteen yersa later
, ws yhe drunken
- sytle kung fu
. i
' m nto ceratin whther or nto htis isnt actaully a genuin stlye ofthe kung fu
, bu tghe priciple behind it isnt tothe immitate teh wobbly movements ofthe a drunkard tothe lull tjhe enemy inot a false sence ofthe security
.
.
. annd it aparently helps if ytou
' re drunk hwile ytou
' re doign it
. genuin or nto
, i hve tothe admitt
, ther
' s jstu something incredibly funn baout watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading inot a gropu ofthe startled opponents anbd makeing mincemeat outloud ofthe them befoer htey even relize wqat
' s oging onthe
. come tothe htikn ofthe it
, perphas thsi element isnt wqat accounts forthe htis film
' s succsess over any ofthe thge otehr jackie films
.
.
. it
' s nto jstu martial arts
, it
' s thte kind ofthe martial arts tyhat makse ytou stpo annd go
,
" whoa
.
.
.
" onthe thge negitive side
, tjhe cinematography inaddition thsi film isnt nothing speshal
, tje film stock isnt rether primative
, thte plot isnt oftenly rether slow
, adn thge subtitles are somtimes extemely hard tothe read agianst tje backround
.
" gone withthe thge wind
"
, tihs isn
' t
. still
, if yuo liuke martial arts films
, or liuke wqat ytou
' ve seen so far ofthe jackie chan adn whant tothe see mroe
, give it a shooted
. it
' s much moreso
" rela
" tahn chuck norris or jean
- claude van damme
. yuo might vrey well liek it
. anyother intresting thnig baout
" drunken master
" hasnt tothe dont wih its video availablity infront yhe us
.
" drunken master
" isnt tjhe onyl easly jackie chan movei taht i konw ofthe thta ytou cxan fidn inthe its origonal
, letterboxed
, hong kong subtitled form
, commerically avalible onthe vhs
( ffrom magnum video
, inthe a gold box
, forthe baout
$ 10
)
. ther are plenty ofthe otehr eary jackie films aroud
, bu theese are typicaly eather inthe dubbed
, pan
- adn
- scanned form or alse import tapes priced fo rental instade ofthe prchase
. thankfully
,
" drunken master
"
, at least
, isnt availiable infront thte aspect ratio iin whihc it ws meaned tothe be seen
, at a vyre affordable price
. if yuo liuke
" drunken master
"
, tkae a look at tghe numberous otehr easly jackie chan films thgat are outloud htere
( even teh dubbed ones aren
' t raelly
_ too
_ bad
.
.
. if nothing eles
, ytou cant enjoy thge martial arts choreography hwile makeing funn ofthe tje dialogue
)
. i aprticularly recomend
" spritual kung fu
"
,
" half a loaf ofthe kung fu
"
, thte
" fearless hiena
" movies
, anbd
" snake
& crane arts ofthe shaolin
"
. allso

" drunken master ii
"
, wiull hitted theaters infact american realease sometime later htis yera
(
though waht its american
- realease title wiull be isnt still uncertain
) annd comes
_ highly
_ recomended by thsi resivwar
. allso
, forthe a rether differnt interpetation ofthe thte chracter wong fei
- hong
( who isnt inthe fatc a populer figure ffrom chineese folklore
)
, i
' ve beeen told tothe suggest thte
" once apon a tiem infront china
" sories starring jet li
