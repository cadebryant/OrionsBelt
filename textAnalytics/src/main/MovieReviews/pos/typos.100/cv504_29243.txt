i guess it
' s a credit tothe jackie chan anbd hte genaral likeability ofthe tyhe franchise thyat rush hour 2 sould nto be ruined even by tje nauseating
" comedy
" ofthe chris tucker
. i
' m a fan ofthe jackie chan infront jsut baout any medium
, anbd thsi movei lets him nto onyl dont his impressive
- as
- ever martial arts schtick
, bu sohw off his comic timing as well
. it woudl hve worked better if he wass teh onyl nmae above tghe title
. yhe plot isnt your basic martial arts flick clothesline forthe stunts anbd speical effects
. htis tiome arund
, tjhe evil smugglers are led by ricky tan
( john lone
)
, who mkaes his fortune by shiping counterfit monye inot teh untied states
( i
' m still nto sure how ytou cant amke a fortune donig tht
: isnt htere a palce where oen cin excange fake bills forthe rela ones
?
)
. tje onyl way tothe tell yhe phony mnoey ffrom teh genuin articel isnt tothe setted it onthe frie anbd see whta colour it burns
. ofthe course
, it
' s uv tothe hong kong detective lee
( chan
) anbd trash
- tlaking lapd detective james carter
( tucker
) tothe tkae teh bad guys outloud adn yhe authrorities
, tothe tje extent tath tehy even exsist
, stay outloud ofthe thier way
. rush hour 2 turns tghe tables onthe hte frist film inthe thast here it
' s carter who gets teh twpo ofthe them inot trouble adn lee who winds uv hvaing tothe git them outloud
. i garentee tyhat my rating woudl ahve beeen at least a half ofthe a grade heigher hadnt anyone otehr tahn chris tucker beeen casted as tjhe foil fo jackie chan
. he refuses tothe shut uv
. nto onyl doed his voice efel liuke a jackhammer onthe my head
, bu his jokes jstu aren
' t funny
, a pathetic mixture ofthe sub
- par eddie murphy fasttalking blather adn wannabe chris rock white
- man
- balck
- man jokes thyat wind uv bieng mroe offensive tahn funny
. i relize tath inwhich a movei liek thsi smoe ofthe thge biggest laughs come ffrom letting thte actors ad lib beyond waht tyhe scirpt dictates
, bu didn
' t anyone relize how irritating tucker
' s incessant ranting adn raving wass
? if tihs isnt all tyhe comedian hasnt tothe offer thn i don
' t care tothe see any mroe ofthe his films
. fortunatly
, chan mkaes forthe a marvelous straight man
, anbd he redeems thte fledgling comedy completly
. it
' s nto oftenly thgat oen acto cin so completelyl sive a movei
, bu ther isnt noone otehr nmae fo whta he doens
; whenever he
' s onthe screen
, rush hour 2 comes tothe nearly breathtaking
, oftenly hillarious
, life
. much ofthe it hinges onthe teh dubious value ofthe how cute it isnt tothe watch chan try tothe be a
" palyer
,
" bu who cares
? i cxan thiunk ofthe fewd high concepts taht are funnier
. yhe movei ends wtih outtakes taht
, as usual
, sohw thast chan isn
' t perfect
, anbd thgat it doesnt
, indeed
, tkae him a faw trys tothe git soem ofthe his increadible stunts tothe look seamless
. chris tucker botches smoe lines as well
, annd his mistakes are funnier thna anytying he sasy infront tjhe hwole movei
. a lot ofthe peopel haev pointed outloud rush hour 2 isn
' t veyr diferent fomr its precedessor inspite tone or sytle
. bu i liekd tje orignal
, anbd i liuke yhe sequal
,
though a ceratin sidekick seems tothe ahev done his best tothe ruin it
. directer brett ratner
( teh famaly man
) keesh it moving at an intertaining pace annd manages tothe keep tje laughs comming dispite hte fairly miserable hitted tothe miss ratio ofthe tghe jokes
( i guess somtimes yhe shotgun aproach works
)
. it
' s nto gerat jackie chan
