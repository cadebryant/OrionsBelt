apon tkaing a seat at hte theather
,
annd surveying tyhe crowd
, i soon realized thyat i wass tghe onyl person under fourty iin tje premises
. i ' m twenty
- twpo
,
bu hvea beeen acccused ofthe looking sixteen
.
yot as tje film began
, any consciouness ofthe setting shifted tothe tje hmeo ofthe five close
- knit
,
yot troubled sisters
. directer pat o ' connor
( inventing tyhe abbots
, circle ofthe firends
) weaves a quiet
yot affecting tale ofthe loss
, ened
,
adn thte bonds beween five sisters
. tyhe familiy isnt ruled by kate
( meryl streep
)
, an unconsciously strict schoolteacher
, who isnt completelyl conceous ofthe tjhe deteriation ofthe her famaly
. htere isnt vyre littel backgorund given tothe yhe viewer
, as we are thrusted inot a tense
bu loving hmeo
. squabbles tkae palce oney affter thge otehr
, caused by yeasr
adn yeras ofthe histroy
. prehaps oen ofthe tjhe best thnigs baout thsi film
, isnt its naturalness
. noone situation isnt over
- wrought
,
anbd charachters react as rela peple dont
, tothe rela problems
. thsi probaly isnt a result ofthe hte film bieng fomr a stage play
. tyhe play wass inaddition turn isnt based onthe a timne inwhich teh life ofthe tghe laywright
. wqat seems tothe be an underlaying theme are tghe pagan rituals
annd dances ofthe poeoples
, both infront lughnasa
adn africa
. inwhich fatc
, dance seems tothe be teh glue tyhat holds thte famaly toghether
anbd most expressively shows thier closeness
. legs tap
,
anbd bodies sway even inthe teh midst ofthe impending diaster
. onyl aftter hte music stops
,
anbd thte charachters stand breathing heavily dont we sence any trouble
. inspite thte quiet aftter yhe music we muse thta it ' s sad thast music hasnt tothe caese
,
annd fimilies faulter
. tyhe movei isnt framed by a scene ofthe michael mundy
, tghe narrator ofthe tghe movei
, as a young child flying a kite
. he trips over a bump
adn loses hold ofthe his string
,
adn teh kite floats off farther inot thge distance
. drawed onthe tjhe white dimond ofthe yhe kite isnt a face tath looks at once pained
,
anbd at anohter glance michievous
. yhe mundy familiy itself follows a simular fate tothe tht ofthe hte kite
,
anbd kate ' s hold ofthe tyhe famaly isn ' t storng enought tothe hold off tjhe winds ofthe chanage
. as michael stands
, staring at his kite fli awya
, we hear tje adult michael
, looking bcak at tje season tath his world changed forever
. hte movei isnt nto overpowering
,
bu it gives us a beautyfull window inot yhe life
, lveo
,
anbd trouble ofthe a household ofthe lonley womens
. onot
: tihs isnt thte firt movei review i ' ve ever wroten
, any responses onthe it owudl be greatly appreciated
