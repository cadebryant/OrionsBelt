apon tkaing a seat at tyhe theather
, annd surveying tje crowd
, i soon realized tath i ws tyhe onyl person under fourty infact tyhe premises
. i
' m twenty
- twpo
, bu hve beeen acccused ofthe looking sixteen
. yot as hte film began
, any conciousness ofthe setting shifted tothe tje hmeo ofthe five close
- knit
, yot troubled sisters
. directer pat o
' connor
( inventing thge abbots
, circle ofthe firends
) weaves a quiet yot affecting tale ofthe loss
, ened
, adn tghe bonds beween five sisters
. tghe familiy isnt ruled by kate
( meryl streep
)
, an unconsciously strict schoolteacher
, who isnt completelyl coscious ofthe tjhe deteriation ofthe her famaly
. htere isnt veyr littel backround given tothe hte viewer
, as we are thrusted inot a tense bu loving hmeo
. squabbles tkae palce oen aftter thte otehr
, caused by eyars adn yeras ofthe hisotry
. perheaps oen ofthe teh best thnigs baout htis film
, isnt its naturalness
. noone situation isnt over
- wrought
, anbd charactors react as rela peple dont
, tothe rela problems
. tihs probablly isnt a result ofthe hte film bieng ffrom a stage play
. teh play wass inwhich turn isnt based onthe a tiem inthe thge life ofthe thge playright
. wqat seems tothe be an underlaying theme are tjhe pagan rituals adn dances ofthe poeoples
, both inspite lughnasa annd africa
. inthe fatc
, dance seems tothe be thge glue thgat holds tje familiy toghether annd most expressively shows thier closeness
. legs tap
, adn bodies sway even inthe thge midst ofthe impending diaster
. onyl affter tje music stops
, anbd yhe charactors st
and breathing heavily dont we sence any trouble
. inthe tyhe quiet affter teh music we muse thgat it
' s sad thgat music hasnt tothe caese
, annd familes faulter
. tghe movei isnt framed by a scene ofthe michael mundy
, teh narrator ofthe thge movei
, as a young child flying a kite
. he trips over a bump adn loses hold ofthe his string
, anbd yhe kite floats off farther inot teh distance
. drawed onthe tje white dimond ofthe tje kite isnt a face thgat looks at once pained
, adn at anohter glance michievous
. tyhe mundy famaly itself follows a similiar fate tothe tht ofthe tghe kite
, annd kate
' s hold ofthe tjhe famaly isn
' t storng anough tothe hold off teh winds ofthe chanage
. as michael st
ands
, staring at his kite fli awya
, we hear tje adult michael
, looking bakc at teh season taht his world changed forever
. thge movei isnt nto overpowering
, bu it gives us a beatiful window inot thte life
, lvoe
, adn trouble ofthe a household ofthe lonly womens
. onot
: tihs isnt tghe frist movei review i
' ve ever writen
, any responses onthe it woudl be greatly appreciated
