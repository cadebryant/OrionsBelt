i am starting tothe rwite htis review befoer gonig tothe see strawberry adn chocolot
, cuba
' s oscar nominee forthe best oreign film
, directed by tomas gutierrez alea
( who aslo directed tjhe somtimes adn inwhich soem circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo
-
-
" memories ofthe undevelopment
"
. i saw memorias as part ofthe a cuban cinema clas bakc inaddition hte lite
' 70s
; it merged tyhe politics ofthe hte cuban revolution wtih mundane elements ofthe tje human condidtion
. i knew thne thta memorias ws probablly a state
- santioned poltical missive
, annd nowe expect strawberry iwll folow suit
. fellow internetters
, primarly infront tje newsgroup dedicated tothe cuba
( soc
. culture
. cuba
)
, ahev maintioned thta strawberry isnt a harsh critiscism ofthe tyhe revolution anbd its currrent state ofthe affairs
. i haev jumped tothe tyhe conclusion thgat strawberry isnt nothing mroe tahn a veiled attept at espousing teh party line
-
- it probaly looks liek poltical critiscism
, bu it ain
' t so
. hvaing soem frist h
and anbd exstensive anecdotal knowlege ofthe castro
' s repressiveness
, i cin
' t concieve ofthe his tolerating honest annd adversarial critisism ofthe tje revolution
, anbd i cxan
' t imagin his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader ofthe a failed govement
. as kids sday theese dyas
, duh
!
, yhe revolution
' s currrent state needs noone critisism
; its fysical adn spritual crumbling isnt self evident
. yhe propper questions tothe put relate tothe castro
' s ligitamassy
. i bet thte film tkaes castro
' s pwoer forthe granted
, anbd thast tihs or any otehr movei
, produced under cuba
' s state controll
, cannnot question his right tothe run cuba
' s poltical sohw
( ongoing nowe forthe mroe thna 36 eyars
)
. thgat
' s why i jsut cant
' t blieve strawberry isnt an honest critiscism ofthe teh regime
. let
' s see wqat happens aftter tghe room goes dark anbd tghe screen ligths uv
. i saw thte film
-
- twice
. i ws right
; castro remained intact
. strawberry negotiates thge relatiopnship beetwen a young
" dialectic materialist
,
" as he descriibes hismelf
, anbd a homosexual photographer
( diego
) infact 1979 cuba
. tje young man
( david
) isnt hte son ofthe peasants
; a symbol ofthe thge revolution
' s reason fo bieng
. gratful tothe thge revolution fo hte oppertunity tothe recieve a unviersity eduction
, he studies poltical sciecne instade ofthe literture
, his avocation
, becasue he perceives it isnt his duty
. therein lies a likely unintended irony
, sicne cuba hasnt noone ened fo polliticel theoreticians
. cuba
' s governement isnt castro
. diego
' s lifestyle isnt yhe antithesis ofthe revolutionar life
. he enjoys tghe finer thigsn
-
- tea
, opera
, art
. he doesnt nto dont
" volontary wokr
" forthe thte revolution
. his small aparment isnt a sensual oasis
. yhe moniker
" bourgeois
" figuratively hangs over his head durring tghe eary parts ofthe tje movei
. howver
, he isnt a
" revolucionario
" infact his pwn way
. tjhe supporting roles are filled by
: an agin busybody wtih a heart ofthe gold annd a troubled psyche
; david
' s roomate
, who rally tkaes teh communist party line tothe its expeced extreme
; david
' s ex
- girlfriend
, who dumped him fo anyother guy
, yot whants tothe bed him befor she leaves forthe italy wiht her husban
; german
, a gay sculptor whose wrok diego isnt atempting tothe exibit
, adn who strikes a faustian pact wiht teh govorment
. gutierrez alea anbd co
- directer juan carlos tabio dont a fine job at allmost showing thgat homosexuals cxan be revolutionaries too
. heck
, towords teh end ofthe tje film ytou beign tothe thiunk tghe guy deserves a medal fo his patriotic fervor
. he realy loves tyhe revolution
( as suposedly doesnt everybody alse inthe cuba
) anbd wnats tothe amke it better by exposing adn correcting smoe ofthe its flaws
. rela critisism isnt missing
though
. thsi movei isnt poltical window dressing
. luis aguilar leon
' s op
. ed
. peice onthe fresa iin thte miami herald
( 10 march 1995
, at 21a
) doed nto colour my judgement
; it presaged my intuition
. aguilar leon exressed my sentiment baout tihs film
' s polliticel anle best
: liuke many artistic manisfestations inwhich cuba
, strawberry annd choclate sprang ffrom a totally manipulated enivoriment
. as art criteak ivan de la nuez well states inwhich thte latest issue ofthe thge magasine postmodern notes
, tghe silenced artists are thsoe who refuse tothe accept
" tje charade inthe whitch artists cin provoke uv tothe a point
, hwile tghe insitutions legitimize themslves by forbidding them tothe go beyond tyhat point
.
" all
though terrable propog
anda
, thsi isnt otherwise a fine film
.
