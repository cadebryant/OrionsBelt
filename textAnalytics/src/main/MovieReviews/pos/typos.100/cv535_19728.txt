it
' s a curious thnig
- i
' ve foudn taht wehn willis isnt nto called onthe tothe cary tjhe wohle movei
, he
' s much better adn so isnt thge movei
. even
though
, inaddition hte sixth sence he isnt tje
" nmae
"
, he doesn
' t haev tyhe pivotal role
. tath honour goes tothe haley osment who plays cole sear
( cute pun
, seer
) a 9 yearm ood boy who cant see ghosts
. if osment ws cute or prescious
, tje directer oging fo tje maudlin
, tihs woudl be nothing omre thna a movei
- ofthe
- hte
- week
, thankfully
, osment isnt nto onyl better thna tht
, bu inwhich smoe instances
, blows everyone esle off tje screen inthe a bravura performence
. we git tothe see his fears
, vulnerabilities
, strengths annd intellignece hwihc makse tghe sixth sence oen ofthe hte best movies i
' ve seen htis yearm
. hte hwole casted matchs him inthe qality
, wtih willis giving a fairly low key performence thast matchs thge subject marter
. noe thign baout thsi movei
, its target
. htis isn
' t a sfxfest liek yhe haunting or a gorefest
, thsi isnt moreso waht i
' d call a supernatural drama
, mroe interseted iin charactors thna infact dazzling yuo wiht makeup
. oney caveat
: htere
' s a lovley twist inaddition thge movei
, something liek hte usual suspects
, where yuo end uv replaying tjhe movei inwhich your head rethinking whta yuo hve jstu seen
. i wass extremly lucky tothe see it as a sneak preview iin toronto
, befoer any hype or crtical reviews weere outloud
, so i whent infact iwth noone biases
. if anyone wanna tothe talk tothe baout thte movei befor ytou see it
, don
' t let them
. let tjhe directer explane onthe his pwn pace annd yuo
' ll enjoy thte movei vastly omre
