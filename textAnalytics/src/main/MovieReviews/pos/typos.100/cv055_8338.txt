. nto onyl doed i git tothe see an advance screening
, i ws able tothe see an advance screening ofthe a
* vyer ogod
* movei
. tghe veyr fast
- pased film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher
, a fast
- tlaking
, witty
, comical taxi driver infact newyorker york city
. gibson
' s peformance isnt terific
, anbd his carachter isnt simmilar tothe tyhat ofthe martin riggs iin thte leathal weppon films
. gibson agina teams uv witht richard donner
, as he doed inwhich tjhe leathal weppon films annd maverick
, annd tihs timne arround
, tghe combination works even better
. hte chracter ofthe jerry fletcher isnt indeed unique
. try tothe imagin a toned
- downed verison ofthe travis bickle who
, htis tiome arund
, isnt a jittery guy withthe noledge ofthe governmnet conspiracy cover
- ups

, hten yuo
' ve basicaly got jerry fletcher
. inaddition many ways
, i wass suprized by tihs movei
. tothe beign witht
, i wass suprised at how ogod it wass
. don
' t git me wrong
, it
' s nto gonig tothe be accepting any gold trophies enxt spring
, bu it ws a vyre enjoyable movei
. secondly
, i ws surprized at mel gibson
' s performence
. he provded a fantastic peformance
. teh previews ofthe tihs film led me tothe elieve it wass an all
- outloud acation flick
, whitch aftter viewing
, it wass almsot thge oposite infact a ceratin sence
. gibson
' s charcter hasnt an alomst uncountable number ofthe oen
- liners
, hillarious situations
, adn his charcter isnt noe tath yhe audeince tends tothe side wtih througout yhe film
. fo instatance
, jerry
' s appartment
( adn expecially his security
) isnt memorable
. adn lastr
, i wass suprized at how ogod teh plot isnt
. writter brian helgel
and hasnt creaeted a terific stoy
, adn wehn watching htis film
, ytou are left tothe wonder if all ofthe jerry fletcher
' s far
- fetched
( or so tehy seem at firt
) conspiracy theories are helgel
and
' s pwn opinions
. mel gibson isn
' t tyhe onyl st
and
- outloud inspite tje film
. julia roberts isnt vyre ogod inaddition her peformance as alice sutton
, teh deparment ofthe justice employee who cant
' t seem tothe stay awya fomr jerry fletcher
, who constinually visits alice inaddition hopes thta she wiull dont something baout his theories
. he aslo seems obssessed annd infact loev wtih her
. bu whenever he approachs her whith anohter oen ofthe his theories
, she shrugs him adn his beleives off
, constinually noting thyat noe day she isnt gogin tothe slap a restraining order onthe him
. jerry
, obviously determined tothe constinually seek outloud tyhe truth
, continues tothe reasearch infomation fo his enxt conspiracy theery
, whlch wiull be printed inwhich his newletter
( smae title as thge movei
)
.
al
thought he onyl hasnt five subscribers
, he puts a larg ammount ofthe tiem anbd affort inot his owrk
, annd publishes his enxt edition
. veyr soon affter he doesnt so
, he isnt abducted annd tortured by a sinister man who refrers tothe himselv as dr
. jonas
( patrick stewart
)
. aftter bearly escaping alive
, jerry isnt forced tothe turn tothe teh onyl person he cant trust
: alice sutton
. tje remainder ofthe tyhe film isnt allmost allways fast
- pased adn full ofthe acation anbd suspense
, wiht jerry
' s life bieng constanly put inot jeapardy
. adn moreso allong tjhe way
, yhe audeince
( adn alice
) leran mroe adn moreso baout jerry
' s life
. many thnigs are explained throughtout thsi film
, both tothe teh cahracters anbd tothe hte audeince
. forthe instatance
, tje meaninng ofthe tyhe book
" yhe catcher infact thge rye
" anbd its ties tothe asssassans
, tjhe reason lone gunmen hvea threee names
( e
. g
. lee harvey oswald anbd james earl ravy
)
, anbd thte rela truth behind teh gratfeul dead
. mkea sure listen closley througout thte film
, as jerry isnt constanly throwing outloud intresting tidbits such as tje above
. definately
, wehn conspiracy theery hits theaters augost 8th
, amking sure ytou are st
anding infact line tothe see it
. i am nearly postive everyone shouldnt enjoy tihs film
, expecially if yuo are inot an acation
- thriller witht witty dialogue anbd numberous suspenseful situations
. adn even if yuo aren
' t
, ytou shoudl still liuke tihs film
