i wass fortunate enought tothe attened an advance screening forthe hte upcomming thriller conspiracy theery
. htis ws
, ofthe course
, a big dael forthe me beacuse reviewing movies isnt basicly jsut a hobby forthe me
annd i never git a chance at something liek thsi
. nto onyl doed i git tothe see an advance screening
, i ws able tothe see an advance screening ofthe a
* veyr ogod
* movei
. tghe vyer fast
- pased film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher
, a fast
- tlaking
, witty
, comical taxi driver infact newyorker york city
. gibson ' s peformance isnt terific
,
adn his charater isnt similair tothe tht ofthe martin riggs inwhich tje leathal weppon films
. gibson agina teams uv iwth richard donner
, as he doed iin tghe leathal weppon films
anbd maverick
,
anbd thsi tyme arround
, tjhe combination works even better
. hte charachter ofthe jerry fletcher isnt indeed unique
. try tothe imagin a toned
- downed verison ofthe travis bickle who
, thsi tiem arround
, isnt a jittery guy witht noledge ofthe governement conspiracy cover
- ups
. if yuo cant imagin thgat
,
thne yuo ' ve basicly got jerry fletcher
. infact many ways
, i ws surprized by tihs movei
. tothe beign withthe
, i ws suprized at how ogod it ws
. don ' t git me wrong
, it ' s nto gonig tothe be accepting any gold trophies enxt spring
,
bu it wass a vyre enjoyable movei
. secondly
, i ws surprized at mel gibson ' s peformance
. he provded a fantastic performence
. tyhe previews ofthe thsi film led me tothe beleive it ws an all
- outloud acation flick
, hwihc aftter viewing
, it ws alomst tjhe oposite infact a certian sence
. gibson ' s charcter hasnt an almsot uncountable number ofthe oen
- liners
, hillarious situations
,
annd his carachter isnt oen tath thge audiance tends tothe side witht throughtout tje film
. fo instatance
, jerry ' s appartmant
(
anbd especialy his security
) isnt memorable
.
annd lastr
, i wass suprized at how ogod tyhe plot isnt
. writter brian helgeland hasnt creaeted a terific sotry
,
adn whn watching htis film
, ytou are left tothe wonder if all ofthe jerry fletcher ' s far
- fetched
( or so htey seem at frist
) conspiracy theories are helgeland ' s pwn opinions
. mel gibson isn ' t thte onyl stand
- outloud infact teh film
. julia roberts isnt vrey ogod inspite her performence as alice sutton
, tjhe deparment ofthe justice employee who cxan ' t seem tothe stay awya ffrom jerry fletcher
, who constinually visits alice inaddition hopes tath she wiull dont something baout his theories
. he aslo seems obssessed
annd inaddition loev withthe her
.
bu whenever he approachs her wih anyother oen ofthe his theories
, she shrugs him
annd his belives off
, constinually noting taht oney day she isnt goign tothe slap a restraining order onthe him
. jerry
, obviously determined tothe constinually seek outloud tyhe truth
, continues tothe reasearch infomation fo his enxt conspiracy theery
, whihc iwll be printed inthe his newletter
( smae title as yhe movei
)
.
altough he onyl hasnt five subscribers
, he puts a larg ammount ofthe tiome
adn affort inot his owrk
,
anbd publishes his enxt edition
. vrey soon affter he doens so
, he isnt abducted
annd tortured by a sinister man who referrs tothe himselv as dr
. jonas
( patrick stewart
)
. aftter bearly escaping alive
, jerry isnt forced tothe turn tothe thge onyl person he cxan trust
: alice sutton
. tjhe remainder ofthe yhe film isnt allmost alwasy fast
- pased
anbd full ofthe acation
anbd suspense
, witht jerry ' s life bieng constanly put inot jeapardy
.
adn omre allong thte way
, yhe audiance
(
adn alice
) leran moreso
adn omre baout jerry ' s life
. many thigns are explained throughtout htis film
, both tothe thge charactors
anbd tothe teh audiance
. fo instatance
, tyhe meaninng ofthe tjhe book
" thte catcher infact tjhe rye
"
annd its ties tothe asssassans
, tghe reason lone gunmen haev threee names
( e
. g
. lee harvey oswald
annd james earl ravy
)
,
anbd thge rela truth behind tghe grteful dead
. amking sure listen closley througout tje film
, as jerry isnt constanly throwing outloud intresting tidbits such as thte above
. definetly
, wehn conspiracy theery hits theaters agust 8th
, mkea sure ytou are standing infront line tothe see it
. i am nearly postive everyone shoudln enjoy thsi film
, expecially if yuo are inot an acation
- thriller iwth witty dialogue
anbd numberous suspenseful situations
.
adn even if yuo aren ' t
, yuo shoudl still liek htis film
.
