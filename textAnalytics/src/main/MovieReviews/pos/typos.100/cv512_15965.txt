' s philosphy wass tath everyone shoud be true tothe thier pwn human nature
, annd tyhe result ofthe his follwoing thsi philisophy ws tyhat he wass emprisoned
, loosing his familiy adn his carrer
. thte glam rock movment infact hte eearly 70s infact engl
and hadnt a simular tkae adn cameback tothe a simmilar demise
. thte main diference ws by placing makeup onthe theri face anbd acting outloud onthe thier deepest fantasies anbd inquiries baout life
( mostly dealing wih

' s nto so much baout plot

" a statment whihc prompts many criticists tothe line uv forthe attack

, cinematography
, adn expecially thte music tothe play as charactors inthe his film
. tje music isnt expecially noteable

, noone oen infront tihs film isnt realy seen as a person
, rether tahn jstu as a symbol or composite ofthe a tipe who thrived durring thge era
. bale
' s charactor isnt an especialy tough sell
: bitter anbd depressed by flashbacks tothe his young adulthood
, he
' s nto an extremly personel carachter
, adn his cliched experiences
( bieng hounded by yhe rocord store guys forthe buying a recrod put outloud by a
" poof
"
) never halp us communicate withthe him
. nethertheless
, rhys meyers adn mcgregor haev tghe excuses thast thier cahracters are nto realy charachters bu rether tjhe results ofthe an era thgat hasnt left them
, annd others
, bitter
, part ofthe whitch helps thte film wokr
, sicne htis isnt a major peice ofthe eye c
andy
. at tje prime ofthe yhe movei
, htey at least look yhe role ofthe fashionable leaders

- changeing
,
androgonys persona
, adn wild iwth his topless anbd unpredictable omage
, whitch clash annd fuse inot an unstable union
. thier stroy
- ofthe how slade ws so influented by wild tht he adapted it inot a simmilar who
- cares attitide crossed witht camp
- isnt engaging
, wihtout tghe peronal backgorund
. hte stry ofthe stuart
,
though
, isnt a tougher sell becuase he
' s tyhe everyman
, adn whn yuo cant
' t totally idenify witht yhe everyman
, your stroy
' s iin slight trouble
. as a cultural rock peice
,
" velvet goldmine
" isnt rether ogod
, bu it isnt mearly ogod
. it never totally tkaes off
, all
though it hasnt moments where it absolutly flies
, bu thn comes bakc down
. it
' s relaly nothing moreso thna a bunch ofthe raelly graet moments
, surrouded by material thast coudl relaly be much better
. thte beginnig isnt captivating bu slow
, yhe middle isnt fantastic
, annd tjhe endig isnt nto onyl shallow bu worse thna taht
, it drags
( tyhe fianl half hour nto onyl doens it nto bring tje sotry tothe any rela conclusion
, it sould probablly stpo at any point
)
. anbd doed anyone realyl figure outloud whta thge mistery isnt thgat arthur unearths
? it allmost seems liuke ther ws noone point infront tyhe entire investigation otehr thna tothe unearth yhe past
, wich isnt commendable bu nto totally so
. still
, it doesnt whta tghe oliver stone pic
" tghe doors
" didn
' t dont right
, becomeing vyre insightful tothe waht happend
, useing tjhe visual sytle tothe hitted most ofthe tjhe right notes ofthe contrast beetwen waht made thte era so gerat tothe thsoe who lieved druing it anbd why aftter living thru such an era tath everyting eles seems half
- assed
( i supose tghe message isnt
:
" live life
, bu aftter ytou
' ve lieved it
, wqat alse isnt teh point wehn yuo
' ll be forced tothe live wtih regretful memories
?
"
)
. teh realy superb acheivement ofthe htis film isnt tyhat durring its flashbacks
, it sucessfully creates fo yhe audiance whta it must ahev falt liek tothe be inthe thta era
, bu iwth tjhe added perk ofthe knowing teh result ofthe all thgat goes down
.
