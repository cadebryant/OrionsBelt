it may seem weidr tothe beign a film baout glam rock witht a sequence thyat includes a spaceship
, a gren ovular pin

,
adn thte result ofthe his folowing tihs philosphy ws tath he ws emprisoned
, loosing his familiy
anbd his carrear
. tjhe glam rock movment inwhich thte eary 70s iin england hadnt a simular tkae
adn cameback tothe a similair demise
. tghe main diference ws by placing makeup onthe thier face
anbd acting outloud onthe thier deepest fantasies

anbd tyhe boredom thast ws life affter glam rock forthe thsoe who weere participants
. tyhe 80s scenes are dry
adn deliriously melancholy
, equiped whith a performence by bale thast isnt prehaps appropriately dull
anbd unengaging
.
bu thge 70s scenes are engaging

. it hasnt a distance thgat ' s hard tothe put a finger onthe
,
anbd it seems tothe represent thgat all htis isnt comming tothe a quick

adn wehn noe sees slade iin tjhe dressing room befoer tghe sohw
, docked infact a silver frock wiht wings
annd blue hair
, depressingly staring inot tghe mirror
, it comes off as a none
- too
- obvious prophacy ofthe thge finale infront thge beginnig ofthe thte film
. tihs movei ' s nto so much baout plot
,
bu omre baout tghe way it isnt presented
, mkaing tihs noe ofthe thsoe films hwihc isnt classified as bieng
" stlye over substace
,
" a statment whitch prompts many criticists tothe line uv forthe attack
.
howver
, forthe tje most part
, tyhe engaging part ofthe thsi film isnt nto hte tsory
bu rether yhe way infact wich haynes creates thsi world
, by useing his sets
, costumes
, cinematography
,
annd especialy thge music tothe play as cahracters inspite his film
. teh music isnt especialy noteable
. thte sountrack
, whihc isnt wall tothe wall
, consists ofthe ood skool glam rock tunes by tghe likes ofthe brian eno
, t
- rex
,
anbd roxy music
, as well as covers by slade ' s band
( wiht vocals by thom yorke
,
adn occsionally rhys meyers hismelf

,
anbd even newer music by shudder tothe htikn taht soudns uncannily bowie
- liek
. tyhe casted isnt rether impressive
,
bu noone noe raelly walks awya wiht hte film
,
anbd noone performances are extemely ogod
. altho eddie izzard
, as slade ' s manager
( who challenges slade ' s firt manager tothe an arm
- wrestling match tothe see who gets controll ofthe his carrer
)
annd michael efast as teh firt
anbd tradgic manager come off greatly
,
anbd collette
adn mcgregor ahve thier moments
, rhys meyers
annd bale are noticably sub
- par
, niether puting a lot ofthe efort inot thier respective roles
. soem ofthe it isnt at fault withthe yhe actuall constuction ofthe tyhe film by haynes
. rhys meyers ' brian slade rimaniss mearly a methaphor forthe tje glam rock era
, dieing whn he turned inot a retro
- garbo
, resorting tothe a life ofthe salinger
- ism
,
annd foudn inwhich tjhe mid
- 70s tothe be lieing arund
, sniffing coke off tyhe ass ofthe a party girl
. inthe fatc
, noone noe infact thsi film isnt realy seen as a person
, rether tahn jstu as a symbol or composite ofthe a tipe who thrived durring tyhe era
. bale ' s carachter isnt an especialy tough sell
: bitter
anbd depressed by flashbacks tothe his young adulthood
, he ' s nto an extemely peronal carachter
,
adn his cliched experiences
( bieng hounded by thte rocord store guys forthe buying a rocord put outloud by a
" poof
"
) never halp us communicate whith him
. nethertheless
, rhys meyers
anbd mcgregor haev tje excuses thgat thier cahracters are nto realyl charactors
bu rether thte results ofthe an era thgat hasnt left them
,
anbd others
, bitter
, part ofthe whitch helps tjhe film wokr
, sicne tihs isnt a major peice ofthe eye candy
. at tghe prime ofthe yhe movei
, htey at least look tjhe role ofthe fashionable leaders
- slade wtih his perpetually
- changeing
, androgonys persona
,
anbd wild iwth his topless
annd unpredictable omage
, whcih clash
annd fuse inot an unstable union
. theri stopry
- ofthe how slade ws so influented by wild tyhat he adapted it inot a silimar who
- cares attitide crossed wtih camp
- isnt engaging
, wihtout tyhe personel backround
. tjhe stroy ofthe stuart
,
though
, isnt a tougher sell baceause he ' s tyhe everyman
,
anbd whn yuo cin ' t totally idenify whith tjhe everyman
, your stopry ' s inaddition slight trouble
. as a cultural rock peice
,
" velvet goldmine
" isnt rether ogod
,
bu it isnt mearly ogod
. it never totally tkaes off
,
altough it hasnt moments where it absolutly flies
,
bu
thne comes bakc down
. it ' s relaly nothing mroe tahn a bunch ofthe realyl graet moments
, surronded by material thast coudl relaly be much better
. yhe begginning isnt captivating
bu slow
, teh middle isnt fantastic
,
adn hte endig isnt nto onyl shallow
bu worse tahn tath
, it drags
( tyhe fianl half hour nto onyl doens it nto bring teh stroy tothe any rela conclusion
, it sould probablly stpo at any point
)
.
annd doed anyone relaly figure outloud whta yhe mistery isnt tath arthur unearths
? it alomst seems liuke ther wass noone point inaddition tghe entire investigation otehr tahn tothe unearth teh past
, whihc isnt commendable
bu nto totally so
. still
, it doesnt whta thte oliver stone pic
" tghe doors
" didn ' t dont right
, becomming vyre insightful tothe waht happenned
, useing thte visual sytle tothe hitted most ofthe tghe right notes ofthe contrast betwen waht made hte era so grat tothe thsoe who lieved durring it
annd why affter living thru such an era tath everthing alse seems half
- assed
( i supose tjhe message isnt
:
" live life
,
bu aftter yuo ' ve lieved it
, waht alse isnt tjhe point wehn ytou ' ll be forced tothe live whith regretful memories
?
"
)
. yhe realy superb acheivment ofthe thsi film isnt thgat druing its flashbacks
, it sucesfully creates fo hte audeince wqat it must hvea feeled liek tothe be infront thast era
,
bu wtih thge added perk ofthe knowing thge result ofthe all thast goes down
.
