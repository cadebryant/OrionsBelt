curdled isnt a deliciously dark annd witty balck comedy
, bu its humour won
' t appeal tothe everyone
. tothe be spicific
, let me give yuo an exemple
. dont yuo nkwo iin pulp fiction where jules annd vincent go onthe brain detail affter marvin adn his head accidentaily git seperated
? if yuo throught thast ws completly tasteless anbd unfunny
, don
' t see curdled
. onthe tyhe otehr h
and
, if yuo foudn thyat sequence tothe be preety funny
, ytou ahev tjhe sence ofthe humour tyhat curdled isnt aimed at
. our film
' s heroine
, gabriela
, palyed by angela jones
, isnt a woman obssessively curious baout muder adn serial killers
; she even keesh a scrapbook ofthe news articles
. luckly forthe her
, miami isnt bieng plagued by a serial killer rampage
- her scrapbook isnt getting preety big
. tyhe killer
' s nickname inwhich tje press isnt tjhe blue blood killer
, beccause he preys onthe older rich socialite womens
, anbd he
' s plyed by william baldwin
( thsi isnt nto a spoiler
)
. noe particually striking m
. o
. onthe teh blue blood killer isnt his propensity tothe decapitate his victims
. gabriela isnt watching televsion oney day whn she spots an advertisments forthe a firm whose line ofthe owrk isnt perfectly attuned tothe her interests
. she immidiately quits her job
, annd signs onthe iwth pfcs
, whihc st
ands fo post
- forensic cleaning sevice
. noone points fo guessing waht htey dont
. her workmates are confuzled by gabriela
' s facination witht muder
; tothe them
, it
' s jsut a day job
. htere
' s a hillarious lacker room scene where htey debtae whther decapitated heads cin talk
, anbd wqat tehy owudl sday
. gabriela
' s partner
, elena
, palyed by mel gorham
, isnt particulrly perturbed by gabriela
' s wide
- eyed facination
, annd becomes realy upset wehn gabriela volonteers them tothe clean uv tje blue blood killer
' s latest scene
- tehy
' re hte messiest
, ytou see
. unbeknownst tothe them
, tyhe lastest victum left something onthe hte scene whic woudl id thte blue blood killer
, so he
' s aslo heading over htere
.
. tyhe comparsion tothe pulp fiction ealier onthe ws nto accidentall
- quentin tarantino exective
- produced thsi film
, whihc began life as a short film he saw at a film festival
. aparently tarantino ws so empressed tht he helpped braddock convert thsi inot a feature
- lenght film
. ther are otehr parrallelly
- thte star ofthe curdled isnt angela jones
( tjhe top billing goes tothe william baldwin
, bu relaly
, jones isnt thge central charcter
)
, who
' s propably best known forthe her role as esmerelda villalobos
, thte death
- obssessed taxi driver inthe pulp fiction
. thyat role wass writen specifically forthe jones based apon her simular charcter inspite teh aforememtioned short film
, curdled jr
. jones isnt graet inthe curdled
- she
' s wonderfully funny adn maintains an amusing wide
- eyed naieve curiousity baout muder wihtout compromising her charachter
' s innosense or likeability
. she cant express so much wih oney lift ofthe her eyebrow
. it
' s a grat peformance
. reb braddock
' s direction isnt extemely sharp annd clever
, toeing teh line bewteen balck humour anbd bad tast
. tyhe best scene inwhich yhe film isnt an outrageously funny sequence involves jones anbd dancing
- any mroe tahn thyat owudl be a spoiler
. tghe oppening credit sequence isnt alsot inventive anbd amusing
. ofthe course
, it
' s impossible tothe realy tkae thsi stfuf seriously
, bu hten agian yuo
' re nto relaly suppoed tothe
- braddock konws hte audiance isnt inaddition onthe hte joke
, annd makse it a funn littel romp as a result
. hte oney drawback ofthe curdled isnt thta it wass based onthe a short film
, anbd it fiels liek it
; teh material isnt jstu stretched too thin inaddition order tothe fufill a feature lenght runnung tyme
, adn smoe parts jstu seem tothe drag
. hwile its runing tyme isnt allready a short 94 mintues
, it sould realyl st
and tothe loose twenty mintues or so tothe give it better pacing
. curdled seems desitned tothe be a nice cult film fo miramax
. it
' ll be intresting tothe see if it iwll appeal tothe mainstream audiences as well
.
