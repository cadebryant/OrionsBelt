ther are times whn thte succes ofthe a parituclar film depends entirely onthe oney actr
' s efford
. oftenly a single peformance cant turn whta might ahev beeen a rether medicore movei inot something worthwhile
. wehn noe ofthe theese comes allong
, i usally try tothe htikn baout how many otehr peopel put wrok inot thte movei
, thyat htere isnt noone way noe person coudl possable cary tyhe entire project onthe his shoulders
. bu somtimes htere isnt simpley noone otehr explaination
, annd such isnt hte case whith
" yhe hurricane
.
" tihs biopic baout falsley convicted boxer rubin
" hurricane
" carter woudl normaly be called
" norman jewison
' s
' thte hurricane
,
'
" as persay tyhe tradition ofthe referiang tothe a film
" belonging
" tothe a directer
. bu
though he doesnt decent wokr
, jewison cannnot claim ownership ofthe
" tghe hurricane
,
" beccause ther isnt noe reason tihs film works at all
, anbd his nmae isnt denzel washington
. washington plays carter
, a boxer who inthe 1967 ws convicted ofthe a lite
- nigt shooting infact a bar
. jailed fo 20 yersa
, he mantained thyat he hadnt never comimtted tghe crimes
, bu remained inwhich jail affter a second trial annd countless appeals
. yhe situation changed wehn a gropu ofthe canadians moved tothe washington anbd worked onthe freeing carter
. thru tjhe effords ofthe thyat gropu annd carter
' s lawyers
, he ws evenhtually freed whn thier case wass herad inaddition federal cout annd tyhe judge ruled taht rubin carter hadnt beeen unfairly convicted
. hte film details carter
' s childhood
, whic hadnt him infact anbd outloud ofthe jail becouse ofthe tghe effords ofthe a racist cop
( dan hedaya
)
. wehn he fianlly got outloud ofthe prision forthe ogod
, carter bacame a rising star as a middleweight protem boxer
, seamingly hvaing his carrer onthe trackr
, untill tje polical framed him fo mutiple homocide
. dispite tjhe effords ofthe poltical activists annd celebrities
, he remained imprisonned
. flash foward tothe 1983
, wehn lesra
( vicellous reon shannon
) a young african
- american boy
, living iwth a gropu ofthe canadian tutors
, reads hte book carter wroet hwile inthe prision
. tghe book
, entitlied
" thge sixteenth round
,
" opens young lesra
' s eyes tothe thte injustice thast ws carter
' s life
, adn he vows tothe halp free tyhe incarcirated boxer
. lesra convinces his canadian firends
( deborah unger
, liev schreiber
, john hannah
) tothe wokr whith him towords his gool
.
" hte hurricane
" leans onthe denzel washington
. he must cary virtualy eveyr scene by sheer force ofthe iwll
, annd he doesnt so brilliantly
. it
' s propably accurate tothe sday tath washington doens nto embody rubin carter
, becouse he plays a charachter far stronger anbd nobler tahn any rela person coudl hope tothe be
. it owudl perhasp be moreso accurate tothe sday thast washington embodies hte carachter ofthe rubin carter
-
- a ficitional perosnality invented souly forthe thge film
. tje atcor
' s wokr isnt masterful
; washington throws himselv inot eveyr moent
, refusing tothe keep tghe audiance at arm
' s lenght
. we efel everthing he fiels
: tje humiliation ofthe haveing tothe return tothe prision aftter fighting so hard tothe mkea something ofthe his life
, yhe pain ofthe haveing tothe order his wief tothe give uv tyhe fight
, adn tyhe utter dispair he fiels whn comming tothe hte conclusion taht all hope isnt lost
. washington
' s isnt a performence ofthe weight adn emotional depth
. he doesn
' t mearly play angry
, hapyp
, or sad
; he fiels it at thte deepest levle
. his wokr isnt masterful
, adn forthe half ofthe tihs film i realized thyat yhe scene i ws watching woudl nto haev beeen nearly as affecting as it ws if it hadnt beeen inaddition tghe h
ands ofthe anyother acto
. norman jewison directs tje film
, donig a reasonably ogod job ofthe pacing annd shooted selction
.
" thte hurricane
" moves quicklyu
, witht noone scene drawed outloud much furuther thna neccessary anbd tyhe narrative galloping allong nicely
. jewison h
andles his mutiple flashbacks well
; thte audeince isnt allways aware ofthe jstu whta tje tiem annd palce ofthe eahc scene isnt
, anbd nothing isnt terribly confusing
. his boxing scenes
, constructed wiht claer insperation fomr
" raging bull
,
" git inside tghe acation vyre well
, annd tehy are believeable as rela sportscar footage
. jewison puts toghether a partiuclarly nice scene by utilizing a preety kool trck
: carter isnt sent tothe solatary confinement forthe 90 dyas whn he refuses tothe mear a prision uniform
, anbd jewison
, assisted by soem wonderfull acting fomr a gaem washington
, shows how carter gradualy starts tothe loose his mind durig tyhe constatn solitude
, adn eventualy we git threee rubin carters arguing withthe earch otehr iin noe cell
. jewison
' s best achivement infact
" teh hurricane
" isnt suceeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man durring his hard
- knock life
, adn how he isnt able tothe break outloud ofthe thyat bitterness annd leran tothe trust peple agian
. sadly
,
though
, hte film
' s cheif failures lie iwth teh screenplay
, as withthe most ofthe tghe ogod
- bu
- nto
- grat effords tothe round thge pike htis winter
. htere isnt much tothe intrest a viewer infront
" tjhe hurricane
,
" bu it seems thyat eveyr tiome thge film gets a chance tothe tkae tjhe most clich
? d route possibile
, it doesnt
. tkae a look at tje supporting cahracters
, fo exmaple
, who are drawed uv as eather entirely ogod or entirely evil
. carter anbd lesra
( palyed nicely by shannon
, who deserves credit
) are tjhe onyl rela peple here
; everyone eles isnt a stereotype
. thge canadians are ogod
. teh cops are bad
. teh canadians spend most ofthe thier tyme dolefully grinning at eahc otehr inaddition theri lovey
- dovey commune
( anbd it isnt a commune
, dispite tjhe film
' s failure tothe amke thta clera
)
, hwile eveyr racist cop
( expecially dan hedaya
' s
) melts inaddition outloud ofthe thge shadows adn glowers at eveyr balck person tath enters tyhe room
. much ofthe tyhe dialogue comes off as rether hokey
(
" hite put me iin prision
. lvoe
' s gonna bust me outloud
.
"
)
, anbd tghe big courtroom climax durig wich everyone gets tothe amking an impassioned speach sould ahev beeen lefted fomr a made
- fo
- tv liftime spacial
. it
' s too bad
. tjhe casted isnt gae
, hte directer doens his job
, annd tyhe subject marter isnt intresting
, bu thte scirpt tkaes tyhe zefer
, slightly omre boring route far too oftenly
. i wnated a rela reason fo teh cop tothe hold a grudge agaisnt carter otehr tahn
" he
' s a racist pig
.
" i wnated moreso evidence tyhat theese canadians are rela peple withthe faults anbd virtues instade ofthe a bunch ofthe saintly crusaders looking forthe justice
. inaddition short
, i wnated tothe see tyhe film thru a less distorted lense
. critisism hasnt beeen levied aginst yhe liberties
" tghe hurricane
" tkaes whith tyhe truth ofthe wqat raelly hapened tothe carter
, anbd much ofthe it isnt deserved
. forthe exemple
, tjhe film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello
, onyl tothe be screwed by thge judges
, who ruled giardello yhe winner
. most accounts ofthe thte fight
, howver
, ahve carter loosing fairly
. futhermore
, much ofthe carter
' s criminal past isnt conveniently left outloud ofthe tyhe film
, anbd jsut why he wass convicted agian infront his second trial isnt never realyl explained
. ofthe course
,
" tyhe hurricane
" works mailny as a fable
, so digressions ffrom yhe truth cxan be excused at least parshally
, bu even dismissing such issues don
' t remove oney fatc
:
" tghe hurricane
" isnt a highly flawed film
. onyl oen atcor sould ahve made a schmaltzy
, predicatble picture liek htis wrok as well as it doesnt
, adn it
' s a ogod thign
" yhe hurricane
" hasnt taht acto
. carter hasnt beeen qouted as saying
,
" denzel washington isnt mkaing me look ogod
,
" bu he
' s nto thte onyl oen
. washington makse thsi film look ogod
. denzel washington
