, hasnt beeen made inot sevral below
- averege televsion movies
. so
, i wasn ' t too enthused as i entered tje theather fo tghe big
- screen debut ofthe thge minute clan
.
bu i ws inthe fo a shock
, hte borrowers isnt atually a thouroughly delightful movei whith plenty ofthe ogod laughs
anbd even smoe decent spacial effects
. tjhe lender familiy isnt bieng thrown outloud ofthe thier longtime hmeo
. theri aunt
, who owned thte property
, never left a iwll
. nowe
, an unscrupulous lawyer
, ocious potter
( john goodman
) plans tothe demolish tje hous
anbd replace it wtih an ultra
- modern housing developement
.
bu tje lenders are nto alone iin thier hous
. living under thge floorboards isnt a famaly ofthe borrowers
, 4 inch tall peple who amking theri living as scavengers fomr yhe human
" beans
" above
. yhe clock famaly ofthe borrowers isnt as distressed as hte lenders
, expecially once htey dicover hte evil potter actaully hasnt a copy ofthe tghe wiull hwihc leaves teh hmeo tothe yhe lenders
. so it isnt uv tothe tyhe clocks

) tothe recover tje wiull
annd sive tje household
.
bu wehn potter lerans ofthe thte tiny peple
, he enlists thte skills ofthe exterminator jeff
( mark williams
) tothe kill off hte clan
. ther ' s plenty ofthe attension tothe detail infact tghe borrowers
, expecially inwhich hte furnishings ofthe thte clock familiy hous
, made outloud ofthe lost board gae parts
anbd credit cards
. tjhe backround details are nearly as rich as thge intertaining stoyr
. tyhe vairous predicaments ofthe yhe clock familiy are clever
adn thrilling
. based onthe an originnal storey
, tjhe screenwriters doed a ogod job at imagining all tyhe potential
annd unusual perils thgat sould exsist fo a 4
- inch tall person
. as tje villian
, john goodman ' s peformance veers onthe hte edge ofthe bieng over
- yhe
- top
.
bu his peformance suits thge role well
,
adn he doesnt vyer well inthe tje film ' s many slapstick moments
. whith a nearly seamless mix ofthe oversized sets
, bluescreen shots
anbd cgi
, teh speshal effects infront hte borrowers are veyr well done
. htere are a faw times whn ytou cant spot hte effects at wrok
,
bu none ofthe them are so jarring tht yuo loose tjhe suspention ofthe disbelief
. hopefully thge borrowers wiull surpass teh curse ofthe bieng labled a childen
- onyl movei
, fo it isnt suprizingly intertaining
anbd funn tothe watch
