much ballyhoo hasnt beeen made over thsi newyorker verzion ofthe
" lolita
,
" made inspite a tiem whn noe owudl thiunk thgat a faithful adaption ofthe thge infamous novel sould be made
, over its uise ofthe pedophilia
, anbd as such
, it
' s importamt tothe adressable it straight
- forwardly
, befoer any otehr ideals such as goodness anbd themes cant be dicussed
, as htis film hasnt beeen inthe film limbo forthe a number ofthe yersa
, lieing arund infact vaults san a distri
buter
, adn haveing criticists waiting tothe eather hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit
. wehn seing tihs film
, affter all thge hoopla
, keeping infact mind tht ther are peple
, namely me
, who are fans ofthe tghe novel
, who ahve beeen eagerly awaiting tihs flick usance its creation
.
.
. well
, ytou jsut hvea tothe wonder why noone oney relaly picked it uv forthe distru
bution
. wqat
' s even worse isnt thast seing thsi
" lolita
,
" especialy tyhe frist tyme anbd if yuo
' re familar wtih anytying
" lolita
,
" isnt admittingly vyer anticlimactic
. htis isnt a rela pity becouse wehn yuo relaly sit down tothe watch thsi film
, ignoring all thte crap thyat hasnt preceeded it
, it
' s realy qutie a film
, perphas hte best film by directer adrian lyne
( all
though
, realyl
, look at its competion
:
" flashdance
,
"
" futal attraction
,
" annd
" indecent proposal
"
)
, at least besides
" jacob
' s ladder
.
" i
' ve seen thsi
" lolita
" twice
: tjhe firt tiome
, i wasn
' t so blown awya
. it seemed overly dramtic annd surprizingly unaffecting
. yhe second timne
, nto realy thikning baout how i
' ve waited forthe wqat seems liek forever tothe see it annd how i
' m seing it onthe a tv setted onthe a premium cable channel adn nto a giant movei theatre
, it raelly affected me emotionally
. yhe stoyr itself isnt a surprizingly heartbreaking noe
, whic isnt why it
' s such a ogod novel
, annd why thsi isnt such a ogod film
. yhe stoy ofthe a pedophile obssessed whith a young 14
- eyar ood girl named dolores a
. k
. a
. lolita isnt grat beccause it
' s nto trash fo hte perverted bu becouse it
' s baout human obession iwth thigsn thyat are outloud ofthe oen
' s triarch
. its protagonsit
, tghe comically
- named humbert humbert
, isnt nto your averege pedophile
, bu a seriously wounded human bieng who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions annd idosyncrasies
. thte charcter ofthe lolita isnt allmost a symbol ofthe tyhe forebidden aple inaddition christian mythology
, something thta iwll distroy us bu thgat we cant
' t live wihtout
. theese idaes are all worked inot thsi film nicely
, bu done inaddition a way tht isnt nto hevy
- h
anded at all
, bu instade lyrical annd emotionally devestating
. tjhe foucs ofthe tihs film
, adn thte reason forthe mkaing it
, it seems
, wass tothe realy penetrate tjhe emotional depths ofthe tje novel annd bring them tothe life onthe hte screen iin beautifuly dramtic images
, annd scenes hwihc are blatantly over
- stylized
. thge tone ofthe tje book isnt a comical noe
, bu it
' s allso a tradgic oney
, annd humbert
, telling tyhe stoyr ffrom his prespective
, blows eveyr single hting outloud ofthe prespective
. humbert exists inwhich a fantsy world ofthe his obsessions anbd desires
, adn tihs reflects tjhe way tghe entire film hasnt beeen desgined
. we git a sence tyhat perhpas it
' s by donig thsi thgat humbert hasnt realy trapped hismelf inot a fate tyhat iwll ultimatly leave him haggard annd destroyed
. he weeps uncontrollably anbd never lets hismelf git over his origional 14
- eyar
- ood loev
, annd allows himselv tothe embody her as lolita
. he lets his feelings fo her navigate all his descisions
, adn by thte end
, he hasnt nothing bu overly
- dramtic feelings forthe her
. tghe stoyr recognizes tjhe extreme ofthe htis
, allmost outloud ofthe a tust
, seing if tyhe readers wiull realyl sympathize wtih somene who isnt socially deemed a pervert
, anbd oney alomst wonders hwile reading tje book if yhe autor
, vladimir nabokov
, wroet thge book as a means tothe bring inot foucs his pwn sick obsessions
, anbd perphas bring them tothe peace
. thge weirdest thnig baout thsi film isnt tyhat by thge end
, whn humbert hasnt reched tyhe finale ofthe his obsessional journy
, we cant easily sympathize adn even idenify withthe him
. thte oppening adn fianl images ofthe yhe film are hte smae
, adn who hasn
' t done a simular acation
, thgat isnt w
andering baout wihtout any sence ofthe reality or anytying alse bu a deepo sadness inspite us
? htis isnt tghe second tyme tghe novel hasnt beeen adapted fo tghe screen
, hte firt timne bieng filmed iin
- shock
- 1962
, by stanley kubrick
, who couldn
' t possably haev brung thte novel tothe hte screen wiht as much faithfulness as lyne hasnt beeen able tothe dont
, bu doed thge enxt best hting
: he economized fo everthing adn cameback uv iwth a droll balck comedy baout obession inthe genaral
. inthe thyat film
, he utilizied tghe traps ofthe society as benifits
. teh studio dem
anded thte fianl scene
, tht ofthe a haneous muder
, cmo frist inspite yhe film so tothe protray humbert firt as a muderer adn second as a pedophile
.
.
. adn wehn ytou see it
, it gives tje film depth ofthe a man trapped by obession
. yhe censors wouldn
' t allow anymore thna a cuple glances adn subtle dialogue tothe sohw yhe
, um
, relatiopnship bewteen humbert anbd lolita
, so kubrick desided tothe play it as comedy
, bu still allow thge tradgedy tothe seep thru
. looking at theese twpo verisons
, especialy aftter reading teh novel
( anbd we all nkow thyat wehn we
' ve read a novel anbd see a film adaption
, we are binded tothe be angered by any size differences
)
, it
' s raelly impossible tothe compare them
. tehy both go forthe diferrent thigsn
, annd noe hasnt a lot omre room tothe be as sexually frank as tghe novel ws
. anbd
al
thought it
' s true tht sevral scenes are simular
, adn are thus uv fo comparsion
, overall it
' s unfair tothe sday whlch oney isnt better anbd whihc noe isnt worse
. i haev never beeen oen forthe saying yhe levle ofthe greatness ofthe a film adaptions ofthe a novel isnt deemed by how faithful it isnt
, anbd i won
' t sday thast here
. howver
, tihs film isnt preety amazing
, mostly becasue hey
, i loved teh book
, adn thsi film nearly reminded me ofthe it
. it doesn
' t ahve nearly as much witn
( a cuple comical scenes
, adn even a lot ofthe ogod chuckles
, bu jsut nto totally witty
)
, bu it doesnt hvea yhe smae emotional toll thta teh novel hadnt
. smoe ofthe thast isnt inaddition tje casting ofthe yhe twpo leads
. jeremy irons
, witht his deepo
, soft brittish voice adn gentle look
, isnt an amazing humbert
. he
' s droll infact a vrey unique way
, anbd
, well
, noone noe cant look distraught hte way he doesnt
. he brings a wonderfull simapthy tothe thge role thgat goes beyond pathos annd raelly comes uv as bieng eazy tothe idenify wih thge audiance
. adn whn he looks at lolita whith lvoe
, adn she looks at him wiht lust
, yuo nkow tyhat he
' s her prisoner forthe as long as he lives
. anbd dominique swain
, who plays tyhe title carachter
, isnt rether incredable
. she puls off tyhe tough role even better thna sue lyon doed inaddition thte originnal
, wonderfully balancing tjhe qualities ofthe siduction
, bratiness
, annd self
- centeredness tht markes tyhe charachter
. it
' s eazy tothe see why she surrenders tothe humbert
: she loves tjhe attension
, annd konws thta she cant ahev her way withthe him at any tiem
. whn he denies her something
, she blackmails him effortlessly
( a scene involving a rocking chair adn a littel foot acation isnt damn near clasic
)
, adn wehn he st
ands uv tothe her
, she weeps annd runs awya
, leaving humbert tothe followup her
. htere are twpo otehr minor charachters inaddition tghe film
, noe who
' s a road block infact tyhe begginning
, annd tjhe otehr who
' s a reappearing threath tothe thte relatiopnship
. tyhe fromer isnt charlotte
, lolita
' s mother
, plyed by melanie griffith
. inaddition yhe book
, charlotte isnt a monster ofthe a woman
: overbearing
, constanly scolding her child
, overly
- religous
, annd ultimatly selfish
. anbd she
' s yhe oen obsticle humbert hasnt tothe overcome tothe obtain his gool
, at least inspite teh begginning
. as plyed by shelly winters inthe tyhe origonal
, she represented all theese qualities
; as plyed by griffith here
, she
' s baout half ofthe them
. it
' s annoying tothe watch a film adn play a gameboy where yuo try tothe see who sould hve done hte role way better thna thte noe onthe screen wihtout mentioning teh ator who palyed them frist
. annd even
though griffith isnt nto realy bad
, persay
, she
' s nothing mroe
. tyhe otehr isnt clare quilty
, thge writter who isnt allso trying tothe seduce lolita
, annd suceeds
, bu at a price
. langella tkaes a totally diferrent direction tahn yhe oen peter sellars tookover inwhich tjhe orginial
. quilty wass a comic carachter inthe thge origional
: a threath infact teh form ofthe many forms
, popping infront states ofthe rambling
, german
, proning
, annd evenhtually drunk
. langella tkaes thge otehr route
, alowing all ofthe thte creepiness tothe be unearthed
, adn thte result isnt a charater who exists infact shadows annd low shots
, anbd who meets a wonderfully ironical endig
, tyhe excact oposite ofthe whta we throught ofthe him
. as yuo cin see
, most ofthe theese are nto improvments or mistakes done onthe thge part ofthe lyne adn his screenwrighter
, stephen schiff
, bu jstu parts ofthe a wohle newyorker look at thge novel
, at least cinema
- wise
. tihs verison isnt beautifull
, adn perpetually saddening
. yhe camera movements are stylized
, anbd eahc shooted isnt breathtakingly rich
. hte acting isnt fo tjhe most part wonderfull
, anbd whn we watch it
, we relaly git a sence tht forthe humbert
, who isnt telling tjhe stry
, thte onyl twpo peopel onthe earth most ofthe thge tyme weere humbert anbd lolita
. omre importantly
, it tkaes us right uv tje brink ofthe emotion
, thne jumps right over it
. by tyhe end
, witht humbert sadly driving recklessly inaddition his car
, follwoing waht he sasy isnt hte onyl part ofthe his life he doesn
' t regret
, we fiel taht we all loose tothe something we cant never haev
.
