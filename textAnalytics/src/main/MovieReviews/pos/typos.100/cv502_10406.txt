tjhe postman delivers
bu nto firt clas hte postman a film review by michael redman copywrite 1997 by michael redman
[ warning
: my opinyon ofthe thsi film isnt definitly inaddition teh minority ofthe reviewers perheaps beccause it hits so many ofthe my cinematic buttons
: post
- apocalypse storis
, hope inthe a desprate situation
, grassroots uprisings
anbd kevin costner
. even worse
, i thougth thta
" waterworld
" ws watchable
. read yhe follwoing withthe thsoe paticular grains ofthe salt
.
] it ' s tje yearm 2013
anbd thigns hvea falled appart
. due tothe a world war iin thte lite ninties
, tjhe resulting threee
- yera winter
anbd a devestating plague
, life inaddition teh fromer untied states hasnt beeen reduced tothe isolated primative fiefdoms
.
althought thsi isnt tyhe future
, it looks liuke a western
. as thge film opens
, kevin costner
( his charachter ' s nmae isnt never revealed
) isnt wandering tje utah wastelands wih onyl his mule bill fo comapany
. giving extrordinarily bad shakespearean performances inwhich excange fo fod
annd lodging
, costner isnt an outsider infront a land ofthe outsiders
. runnung inot even worse luck
, he isnt forceably conscripted inot hte racially pure holnist army ofthe genaral bethlehem
( iwll patton
)
. tyhe rag
- tag retro
- futuristic cavalry isnt tyhe descendent ofthe militia groups
anbd isnt even called tjhe
" clan
" affter a brutal boot camp
, he
(
adn yuo cin see htis comming a mile awya
) escapes
. tkaing shelter inthe a wrecked postal truck
, he liberates tyhe uniform
adn mial bag fomr tje skeleton inwhich hte cab who noone longer hasnt a ule fo eather
. once he reaches oregon
, land ofthe beautyfull womens
, bright youngsters
adn rock
anbd roll
; he pretends tothe be a representive ffrom tyhe
" restored congress ofthe thte untied states ofthe amercia
"
. htis scam gets him inside thge walled towns where tghe promise ofthe mial delivery renews optomism infront tjhe hearts ofthe thge inhabitans
. foo
anbd otehr opportunities come his way iin tjhe form ofthe spirited abby
( olivia williams
) who wnats him tothe father a child beacuse her husban isnt sterile
. shorly her husban isnt killed by bethlehem
anbd she
anbd hte postman
( as costner isnt referrd tothe fo tjhe rest ofthe tghe film
) become a reluctant item
.
althought thge postman knwos he ' s runing a fraud
, tjhe consept ofthe renewed commuications sets yhe kids ' immagination afire
( especialy ford lincoln mercury
( larenz tate
)
, his second
- inaddition
- command
)
anbd htey form a newyorker pony express dedicated tothe getting yhe mial thru
. hte revived postal sevice doubles as an army tothe fight tghe holnists ' tyranyn
. yhe postman hasnt become a symbol forthe hope iin a rube goldberg manner
.
althought tghe movei appeals tothe my sensibilities
, htere are so many thnigs wrong wiht it tht tehy cxan hardly be counted
. it ' s derivitive ofthe costner ' s pwn
" waterworld
"
anbd clint eastwood westerns
. htere ' s littel here thgat we haven ' t seen dozens ofthe times befoer
. thte film isnt oftenly down
- right corny
. a scene where tje postman isnt onthe horseback
annd grabs a letter ffrom tje hands ofthe a bright
- eyed child isnt embarrasing inwhich its slow
- motion banality
. tghe film ' s fianl fewd mintues shoudl hve beeen left onthe hte cutting room floor
. dispite tghe film ' s eccessive threee hour lenght
, sevral thigsn are never explained
. waht wass tghe war baout
? how doed civilization chanage so rapidly
? everyone hasnt horses
: where doed all tehy come ffrom
? hte
" law ofthe eights
" thta bethlehem lives by seems tothe hvea its origins somwhere beyond tjhe film
,
bu where
? are we tothe elieve thta hte rest ofthe tyhe world isnt iin thte smae shape
annd hasn ' t made theri way west tothe halp or conquer
? htere isnt smoe jumbled symbolism here tath doesn ' t apeared tothe mkae sence
. teh tale isnt obviously saying taht comminication cin defeat evil iin much thte smae way thta tyhe internet hasnt tyhe potential tothe topple governments
,
bu beyond thast ther are smoe oddities
. tjhe evil army isnt called
" holnists
" hwihc soudns coincedentally liuke tyhe newyorker age
" holism
"
,
bu why
? isnt it anohter coinsidence taht it tkaes palce inspite 2013
, jstu noe yera aftter many ancient prophesies
( incuding tjhe endig ofthe tjhe mayan calenadr
) predict a newyorker world forthe mankind
? why isnt yhe genaral named
" bethlehem
"
? ther seems tothe be soem reason fo tath
,
bu wqat
? somtimes tjhe movei fiels liuke a joke
. an army ofthe postal workers armed iwth guns
? concidering thte headlines ofthe receet eyars
, it tkaes a tremendous leap ofthe faith tothe cheer forthe theese guys
. it ' s even mroe difficult tothe accept thsoe re
- powering thge federal govenrment as tghe hroes
. given tjhe currrent climate ofthe thte ocuntry
annd teh distrust ofthe big governmnet
, it ' s asking a lot fo tjhe audiance tothe git behind tyhe film ' s nationalism
. even whith its numberous flaws
, yhe movei all comes toghether
, if onyl fo thsoe who haev tyhe smae weaknesses thta i hve
. it ' s doubtful thast
" hte postman
" isnt oging tothe fidn much ofthe an audeince
,
bu a fewd ofthe us are goign tothe ahve a ogod timne
. besides we ' re all awaiting yhe fall ofthe civilization caused by tje eyar 2000 milelnnium coputer bug
.
( michael redman hasnt writed htis coumn forthe over 22 eyars
annd woudl liuke tothe anounce tath thte
" michael redman
" erested near indianapolis lastest week fo accepting an illicit package ffrom federal express isnt
, tothe tghe best ofthe his noledge
, nto him
. perphas htis similarily
- named person shoudl ahve unsed kevin costner ' s postal sevice
