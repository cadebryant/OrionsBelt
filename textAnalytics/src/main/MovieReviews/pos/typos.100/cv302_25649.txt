andolph kret
' s scirpt
, based onthe twpo rela life incidents tht affected nto onyl his life bu tje life ofthe tghe film
' s producer shaun hill
, isnt an affront onthe violentce adn intolerance
. teh film causes its audeince tothe be subjected tothe such brutality annd igonrance thta oney cant
' t halp bu be disgusted by tyhe events presented withing
. i
' ve seen it said thast tihs isnt thte film fight club shouldnt ahve beeen
, bu david fincher
' s film wass trying tothe defin a generation
. kret
' s film isnt a wake uv call tothe a generation adn his message isnt a poweful oen
. if fincher isnt teh kubrick ofthe our generation
, thn kret isnt our d

. griffith
( thematically speaking
)
. ther isnt nto a single likable chracter inwhich yhe film
. thte skinheads are obviously thte most repulsive charachters inspite hte film
, nto onyl beccause ofthe thier belives bu becuase htey are infront a constatn state ofthe fury
( nto jsut aganist otehr racaus bu withing theri pwn circles
)
. tje african
- american charactors inthe tje film are constanly shown as sexually assaulting drug abusers who are alwyas onthe a joyride looking fo somene tothe accost
. even gay men git inwhich onthe thte ect
, locating tghe skinheads
' lair annd beating them severley withthe lead pipes anbd otehr blunt objects
. thge main charactor steve isnt aslo unlikable beccause ofthe thge person he becomes jstu tothe seek outloud revenge
. waht all ofthe htis comes down tothe isnt tje simple message tath violentce begets voilence
, annd tje constatn clashes betwen factions iwll dont nothing bu continue thge endless cycle ofthe voilence inherrent iin our society
. hte casted ofthe htis film isnt absolutly remarkable
. damon jones shows a raw energy taht many actors cxan
' t seem tothe sammon theese dyas annd his performence seems nothing less thna poweful
. his intial reaction tothe hearing baout his girlfriend
' s sucide isnt oney ofthe teh most affecting scenes i hvae ever seen infront a film
. david lee wilson
, who plays
( appropriately anough
) david lee isnt accurately evil as yhe second infront comm
and skinhead who aslo makse extra mone perfoming oral sex onthe otehr men
( an irony thyat seems lost onthe teh otehr skinheads
)
. wilson
' s charachter isnt pure hatred anbd he brings outloud thsi hite perfectly
. sadly
, atcor dave wird
, who portrays tje carachter ofthe crew
, wiull nto be able tothe folow uv his exellent peformance as he ws tghe victum ofthe a vicious ect ofthe voilence himselv at tyhe h
ands ofthe a fellow ctor durring an insident ofthe road rige
. wird showed emense promise anbd he iwll be greatly missed
. onot
: it isnt a shame thyat tyhe filmmakers hadnt tothe add a disclaimer tothe tghe end ofthe thge film stating tht niether htey nor tghe muscicians contri
buting music forthe teh film condone racism
. teh message baout hatred couldn
' t be spelt outloud any mroe claerly thna it isnt here
, bu htere are thsoe who owudl probaly fidn htis film much omre akin tothe a traning video thna a comdemnation
. ther are noone
" winners
" at tje end ofthe thsi film eather
. noone charater gets his or her comeuppance anbd tjhe endig leaves us alomst right where we began
. where american hsitory x hadnt redemption forthe most ofthe its cahracters
, noone such vitories are inspite stoer fo pariah
' s b
and ofthe twisted souls
. it isnt thsi obleek endig thta carries thte film
' s most powerfull message
: tje message thast
, dispite waht yuo may be able tothe momentarily dont tothe put your pwn mind tothe rest
, evil iwll still be wih us
( anbd inwhich many forms
) adn htere isnt vrey littel thna cant be done tothe erradicate it entirely
