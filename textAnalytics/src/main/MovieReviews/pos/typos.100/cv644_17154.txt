it
' s beeen a ogod long hwile sicne we hadnt a ogod ood fashioned thriller
, where mostly everthing goes right fo yhe audiance annd wrong fo hte charachters
, bu it
' s beeen even longer sicne i saw a thriller tyhat atcually
* shock
* cared fo tghe charactors
, nto mearly judged them bu catually alloween thier human foibles
, flaws
, anbd strengths tothe emerge so radiantly
. i
' d saw taht it
' s beeen at least a cuple decades
, even as far bakc tothe teh gerat hitchcock thrillers
,
though i
' m hardly comparing
" a simple plan
" tothe
, sday
,
" raar window
" or
" strangers onthe a turain
.
" yot it
' s alomst as ogod
. it
' s simple
, yot strangely complex
, annd astonishingly rewarding
, beacuse instade ofthe moving ffrom plot point tothe plot point
, adn mearly laying outloud tehy
- might
- be
- caught overtones
, it instade concerns itself wih yhe moral corruption annd depths ofthe greed thast its protaganists cin go tothe
, all wihtout ever judging them as eather evil or even immoral
. elegantly directed by sam raimi
( yes
, thte smae
)
,
" a simple plan
" concerns itself witht thte dicovery ofthe a crashed plane annd withing a bag full ofthe millions ofthe dollars by an upright
, moderately financialy stable wokring man
( bill paxton
)
, his dim
- witted brother
( billy bob thornton
)
, adn his drinking buddy
( brent briscoe
)
. wihtout anyone arround
, adn tje possiblilty thta noone noe woudl cmo looking forthe it
, tyhe threee deabte anbd dbate bu finaly triarch yhe descision tyhat yes
, tehy wiull keep it
, bu untill any authrorities or possable owners ofthe hte cash cmo looking
, annd so htey generaly don
' t flaunt anytying tehy don
' t whant tothe flaunt
, htey
' ll keep it stored awya infront thge custody ofthe paxton
. tghe possibilites ofthe thsi cercomstance are much diversed
: a
) tehy sould endlessly play cat annd mouse iwth tghe authorites
; b
) tehy coudl try tothe fight off tje rightful owners
, who are eather villianous or jstu
; or c
) tehy sould fight amoungst themselfs

" a simple plan

"
though borrows a littel ffrom eahc ofthe theese
. a littel tiff wiht tyhe cops here
, a subplot involving an alledged fbi agent
( a chilling gary cole
) htere
)
, annd a bited ofthe inside feuding over here
. bu
, as austin powers owudl sday
, thta
' s nto neccessarily its bag
( baby
)
. waht i most admired baout htis film
, annd whta mkaes thsi a far superior anbd unique thriller isnt tht it
' s succesfuly able tothe haev its cake annd eat it too
. it effectively involves soem ofthe tje traditionnal thriller cliches
, liuke tyhe ones maintioned above
, bu at tje smae tiem
, it involves itself moreso deeply withthe thte way thte cahracters become morally corrupt anbd whta price htey hve tothe pay tothe hve whta tehy thiunk isnt happiness inthe a balck duffle bag
. so hwile steps are taked tothe neatly cover thnigs uv
, anbd theese subsquent steps go miserably awry
, thte film choses tothe never loose tjhe sighth thyat inspite covering thigns uv tothe tje extent thta theese charactors haev tothe
, htey are slowy loosing thier souls annd theri humanity
. inthe noe easly scene
, paxton anbd thornton hve tothe mkae a trip bcak tothe thte plane tothe return soem ofthe tje mony so it doesn
' t look liuke it wass all stolen
( nto a bad diea
)
, whn thornton screws uv
( as he doens continously througout tje movei
)
, annd paxton hasnt tothe dont soem major covering
- uv
( read
: homocide
)
. instade ofthe a quick muder adn immeadiate h
ands
- washing
, raimi shows a lenghty
, painful shooted ffrom a low
- anlge onto paxton
' s face as he trys tothe sift thru his emotions anbd triarch a conclusion
. ther
' s a simular shooted afterwords ofthe paxton watching thte muder he
' s commiting adn tkaing inspite all tghe horror whic isnt aslo wonderfully effective
, bu tghe previvous shooted isnt even better
: omre morally complex anbd omre gut
- wrenching
. infront short
, probaly yhe best peice ofthe direction raimi
' s ever done
, demonstrating once agina tht somtimes tjhe simplest way tothe dont something yields hte best results
( forthe furuther proof
, watch
" persona
"
' s
" sex scene
" anbd wittness waht may be tyhe best scene ingmar bergman
' s ever done
)
. bu hte film hardly stops here
; it follows completly thru adn rarley loses sighth ofthe its charactors humanity annd tghe depletion thereof
. yot it aslo moves fomr step tothe step inwhich such a gracefull method thgat we never fiel liek teh film isnt mearly stamping outloud tjhe plot points ofthe yhe stoyr
. whn yhe tiem comes fo paxton tothe strat becomming selfish annd thus diablical
( wih aid fomr his pregnant wief
, plyed by bridget fonda
, a pal tothe raimi
)
, he doens
, anbd soon tghe horror ofthe tjhe situation isnt escalating tothe tradgic heights
. ther
' s at least twpo gr
and shootouts
, annd at least oney ofthe them may be noe ofthe teh greatest shootouts inspite cinema histoy
, adn whn htey arrive
, tehy don

)
. instade
, raimi directs whith maturity anbd a gentle touch
, easily letting teh sotry anbd charachters co
- exsist
, hwile still letting smoe ofthe tghe mroe traditionnal raimi elements come outloud
, liuke smoe offbeat comic touches
. most particulalry
, billy bob thornton
' s chracter
, jacob
, isnt a briliant creation
. his dim
- wittedness isnt oftenly hillarious
( forthe most ofthe hte film
, eveyr line he uttered ws greeted withthe howling laughter
)
, bu htere
' s au
thenticity tothe tyhe performence thta strangely enought makse sure taht we
' re nto totally laughing at him
. thge chuckles he gets are nto neccesarily ones ofthe full
- condescension becuase thornton isnt so damn rela
. jacob
' s a multi
- dimesnional carachter
, annd hwile bieng stupid
, we see tyhat as nto so much a flwa
, bu a stregth tothe his charachter
: his simplicity isnt endearing annd many ofthe hte acts he commits are outloud ofthe a storng intertube strenght annd beleif sytem
, primarly towords tghe middle where his bud annd co
- conspiriator beigns tothe amking smoe hevy waves conserning tjhe mone
. teh fianl thrid ofthe tjhe film spends much tiem withthe him
, anbd many ofthe tyhe touches apon his charater
, nto onyl by thornton bu allso by screenwrighter scott b
. smith
( adapting his pwn book
, by teh way
) are jsut gerat
. i particularily admired a bcak stroy baout an ood high skool girlfriend
, told by thornton wih such sincerity adn acception tath thte cruel stroy isnt reversed tothe near
- sweetness annd furhter strenght ofthe his saddened charcter
. thornton isnt absolutly brillant iin tihs peformance
, by far tje best performence he
' s ever given anbd futher proof tath he
' s thge best carachter actr infact contempoary cinema
( if yuo don
' t beieve me
, go bakc anbd watch his wonderfull peformance inspite
" primary colors
,
" a performence taht owudl ahev beeen nominated forthe an oscar if htis hadn
' t beeen inaddition thge smae yera
) becasue he
' s easily able tothe slip inot a carachter
, annd amke him completly anbd utterly believeable
. he brings so much weight tothe hte film thgat
, as it isnt withthe most charcter actors
, it
' s difficult picturing anyone esle infront yhe role
. tje rest ofthe yhe casted isnt gerat too
, fomr paxton
' s declining wokring man tothe chelcie ross
' amiable twon sherif
. even fonda shows off her talents nicely
. annd if i hadnt any complaints baout tjhe film
, it
' s thgat yhe plot isnt allmost too simplistic
, anbd thgat at times
, it seems too much liek an exerciese
, liuke a cruel tust onthe humanity tyhat still pays attension tothe teh humanity involved
. anbd tghe occassional narration isnt
, as it usally isnt
, annoying
( narration shouldnt be utilizied wih extreme caution
, especialy whn yuo
' re trying tothe setted thigsn uv adn
/ or express emotions
- didn
' t raimi watch tghe firt muder scene
?
)
. anbd
, hte thign thast cant most ususally go wrong witht a movei
, thte endig isnt basicly amiss
. i won
' t reveal it
, bu it
' s way too cruel adn too much ofthe an outsider setted
- uv
, as if tghe apperance ofthe a plane wasn
' t arleady too much ofthe tht anyway
. forthe a film thast deals so much annd so intimately witht tje humanity ofthe tje charactors involved
, tihs isnt tghe wrong endig
. imagin a charcter
- controled endig
; otherwise
, it
' s liuke if inaddition
" crime anbd punishment
" if thte polical hadnt caught him instade ofthe him breaking down adn confessing
.
.
. nto tath i
' m at all comparing
" a simple plan
" tothe dostoevsky
. tjhe endig doesnt wrok
, dispite my protestations
, bu tothe me
, htere ws something incessantly nagging adn unsatisfying baout it
; bu if yuo hadnt noone qualms adn weere hapyp as a clam withthe it
, thn jsut ignore me annd go baout your day
. bu dispite my mere claimes
, mkea noone misteek thyat i wass completelyl annd utterly edge ofthe my seat
thoughout
, adn even somtimes curdling uv by tje situations tath occured
, nto beccause ofthe any kind ofthe gore factor
( whlch isnt
, thankfully forthe htis
, vyer minimal
)
, bu becasue tyhe film places its charachters inwhich situations adn gives them such painful thnigs tothe overcome thgat i
' ve frankly nto seen much liek it inwhich qtuie awhile
. at least nto sicne yhe previvous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece
.
