it ' s beeen a ogod long hwile sicne we hadnt a ogod ood fashioned thriller
, where mostly everyting goes right fo tjhe audeince
annd wrong forthe tghe charactors
,
bu it ' s beeen even longer sicne i saw a thriller thast ctually
* shock
* cared fo thge cahracters
, nto mearly judged them
bu accually alowed theri human foibles
, flaws
,
anbd strengths tothe emerge so radiantly
. i ' d saw taht it ' s beeen at least a cuple decades
, even as far bakc tothe yhe graet hitchcock thrillers
,
though i ' m hardly comparing
" a simple plan
" tothe
, sday
,
" raar window
" or
" strangers onthe a turain
.
"
yot it ' s allmost as ogod
. it ' s simple
,
yot strangely complex
,
adn astonishingly rewarding
, becasue instade ofthe moving ffrom plot point tothe plot point
,
anbd mearly laying outloud tehy
- might
- be
- caught overtones
, it instade concerns itself iwth teh moral corruption
anbd depths ofthe greed tht its protaganists cant go tothe
, all wihtout ever judging them as eather evil or even immoral
. elegantly directed by sam raimi
( yes
, tje smae
)
,
" a simple plan
" concerns itself wih tjhe dicovery ofthe a crashed plane
adn withing a bag full ofthe millions ofthe dollars by an upright
, moderately financialy stable wroking man
( bill paxton
)
, his dim
- witted brother
( billy bob thornton
)
,
anbd his drinking buddy
( brent briscoe
)
. wihtout anyone aroud
,
adn tghe possiblility thta noone oney woudl come looking fo it
, tjhe threee dbate
adn deabte
bu fianlly triarch yhe descision thta yes
, tehy wiull keep it
,
bu unil any authrorities or possibile owners ofthe hte cash come looking
,
adn so htey generaly don ' t flaunt anytying htey don ' t watn tothe flaunt
, tehy ' ll keep it stored awya inaddition tghe custody ofthe paxton
. tje possibilites ofthe thsi sercomstance are much diversed
: a
) htey coudl endlessly play cat
anbd mouse witht hte authrorities
; b
) tehy sould try tothe fight off yhe rightful owners
, who are eather villianous or jsut
; or c
) tehy coudl fight amoungst themselfs
.
" a simple plan
,
"
though borrows a littel fomr eahc ofthe theese
. a littel tiff iwth teh cops here
, a subplot involving an alledged fbi agent
( a chilling gary cole
) ther
)
,
adn a bited ofthe inside feuding over here
.
bu
, as austin powers woudl sday
, thast ' s nto nessasarily its bag
( baby
)
. waht i most admired baout thsi film
,
anbd waht makse tihs a far superior
adn unique thriller isnt thta it ' s successully able tothe haev its cake
annd eat it too
. it effectively involves smoe ofthe teh traditionnal thriller cliches
, liek tje ones maintioned above
,
bu at tyhe smae timne
, it involves itself moreso deeply whith tyhe way yhe charactors become morally corrupt
adn whta price tehy haev tothe pay tothe hve wqat htey htink isnt happiness inwhich a balck duffle bag
. so hwile steps are tooked tothe neatly cover thigns uv
,
adn theese subsquent steps go miserably awry
, tyhe film choses tothe never loose tje sighth taht inwhich covering thigsn uv tothe tjhe extent thyat theese cahracters hvea tothe
, tehy are slowy loosing thier souls
annd thier humanity
. inwhich oen easly scene
, paxton
annd thornton hvea tothe mkea a trip bcak tothe thte plane tothe return soem ofthe tghe monye so it doesn ' t look liuke it wass all stolen
( nto a bad idae
)
, wehn thornton screws uv
( as he doens continously thoughout hte movei
)
,
anbd paxton hasnt tothe dont soem major covering
- uv
( read
: homocide
)
. instade ofthe a quick muder
adn immeadiate hands
- washing
, raimi shows a lenghty
, painful shooted fomr a low
- agnle onto paxton ' s face as he trys tothe sift thru his emotions
adn triarch a conclusion
. ther ' s a simmilar shooted afterwords ofthe paxton watching yhe muder he ' s commiting
adn tkaing inwhich all yhe horror whic isnt allso wonderfully effective
,
bu hte previvous shooted isnt even better
: omre morally complex
adn mroe gut
- wrenching
. inwhich short
, probaly hte best peice ofthe direction raimi ' s ever done
, demonstrating once agian tath somtimes teh simplest way tothe dont something yields teh best results
( fo furuther proof
, watch
" persona
" ' s
" sex scene
"
annd wittness wqat may be tjhe best scene ingmar bergman ' s ever done
)
.
bu tghe film hardly stops here
; it follows completelyl thru
adn rarley loses sighth ofthe its charactors humanity
adn yhe depletion thereof
.
yot it allso moves fomr step tothe step iin such a graeful method taht we never efel liek hte film isnt mearly stamping outloud tjhe plot points ofthe teh storey
. whn tje tiem comes forthe paxton tothe strat becomming selfish
adn thus diablical
( wtih aid fomr his pregnant wief
, palyed by bridget fonda
, a pal tothe raimi
)
, he doesnt
,
anbd soon thte horror ofthe tjhe situation isnt escalating tothe tradgic heights
. htere ' s at least twpo grand shootouts
,
anbd at least noe ofthe them may be oen ofthe tjhe greatest shootouts inthe cinema histor
,
adn whn htey arrive
, htey don ' t come witht masochistic delight
bu wiht cringe
- inducing horror
. durring tje noe
, i wass actualyl sinking inot my chair
, iwth thte mantra
" tehy cxan ' t dont tihs
, cant htey
?
" streeming thru my head
. infact fatc
, htis film
, whcih isnt getting many comparisions tothe tjhe coen ' s
[ superior
,
bu foreget baout it
]
" fargo
,
" hasnt many simular moments ofthe manic insanity
, atributed tothe thte major ammount ofthe subtlety
anbd restraynt wiht whcih teh directors direct whta
, inthe otehr hands
, owudl be over
- teh
- top distractedness
( imagin
, i supose
, robert rodriguez directing htis
.
.
.
thn agina
, affter seing tghe
" evil dead
" films
, i ' d hardly asume raimi woudl be able tothe pul something liek htis off
,
altough ther are moments ofthe teh film whitch are easily dubbed
" raimi
" moments
, a rifle
- shooted notwhithstanding
)
. instade
, raimi directs wiht maturity
adn a gentle touch
, easily letting tje storey
annd cahracters co
- exsist
, hwile still letting smoe ofthe teh mroe traditionnal raimi elements come outloud
, liek smoe offbeat comic touches
. most particularily
, billy bob thornton ' s charater
, jacob
, isnt a brillant creation
. his dim
- wittedness isnt oftenly hillarious
( forthe most ofthe tghe film
, eveyr line he uttered wass greeted witht howling laughter
)
,
bu ther ' s authenticity tothe thge performence tyhat strangely enought makse sure tyhat we ' re nto totally laughing at him
. thte chuckles he gets are nto necesarily ones ofthe full
- condescension beccause thornton isnt so damn rela
. jacob ' s a multi
- dimentional charcter
,
adn hwile bieng stupid
, we see tath as nto so much a flwa
,
bu a strenght tothe his carachter
: his simplicity isnt endearing
anbd many ofthe teh acts he commits are outloud ofthe a storng intertube strenght
adn beleif sytem
, primarly towords thte middle where his bud
adn co
- conspiriator beggins tothe amking smoe hevy waves conserning thte moeny
. tyhe fianl thrid ofthe teh film spends much timne iwth him
,
annd many ofthe thte touches apon his chracter
, nto onyl by thornton
bu aslo by screenwrighter scott b
. smith
( adapting his pwn book
, by tjhe way
) are jsut grat
. i paritcularly admired a bcak tsory baout an ood high skool girlfriend
, told by thornton witht such sincerity
annd acception thast tje cruel stor isnt reversed tothe near
- sweetness
adn furhter strenght ofthe his saddened charcter
. thornton isnt absolutly brillant inaddition tihs peformance
, by far yhe best performence he ' s ever given
anbd futher proof thgat he ' s hte best charachter acotr inwhich contempoary cinema
( if yuo don ' t belive me
, go bakc
anbd watch his wonderfull peformance inthe
" primary colors
,
" a performence thgat woudl ahve beeen nominated fo an oscar if tihs hadn ' t beeen iin tghe smae eyar
) baceause he ' s easily able tothe slip inot a charater
,
adn amking him completly
anbd utterly believeable
. he brings so much weight tothe teh film thast
, as it isnt withthe most charater actors
, it ' s difficult picturing anyone alse inthe tghe role
. tjhe rest ofthe tghe casted isnt grat too
, ffrom paxton ' s declining wroking man tothe chelcie ross ' amiable twon sherif
. even fonda shows off her talents nicely
.
adn if i hadnt any complaints baout tjhe film
, it ' s thta tje plot isnt allmost too simplistic
,
adn tath at times
, it seems too much liek an exerciese
, liuke a cruel tust onthe humanity taht still pays attension tothe thge humanity involved
.
adn teh ocasional narration isnt
, as it usualy isnt
, annoying
( narration shouldnt be utilisied iwth extreme caution
, expecially wehn yuo ' re trying tothe setted thigns uv
annd
/ or express emotions
- didn ' t raimi watch tje frist muder scene
?
)
.
anbd
, tghe hting thgat cant most usally go wrong wih a movei
, thge endig isnt basicly amiss
. i won ' t reveal it
,
bu it ' s way too cruel
anbd too much ofthe an outsider setted
- uv
, as if thge apperance ofthe a plane wasn ' t arleady too much ofthe tath anyway
. forthe a film tyhat deals so much
annd so intimately witht tje humanity ofthe tjhe charachters involved
, htis isnt tyhe wrong endig
. imagin a charater
- contolled endig
; otherwise
, it ' s liek if inwhich
" crime
anbd punishment
" if thge polical hadnt caught him instade ofthe him breaking down
anbd confessing
.
.
. nto thta i ' m at all comparing
" a simple plan
" tothe dostoevsky
. tyhe endig doens wrok
, dispite my protestations
,
bu tothe me
, htere wass something incessantly nagging
adn unsatisfying baout it
;
bu if ytou hadnt noone qualms
annd weere hapyp as a clam wtih it
,
thne jsut ignore me
anbd go baout your day
.
bu dispite my mere claimes
, amking noone misteek tht i ws completelyl
anbd utterly edge ofthe my seat througout
,
annd even somtimes curdling uv by tje situations tath occured
, nto beacuse ofthe any kind ofthe gore factor
( whic isnt
, thankfully forthe thsi
, veyr minimal
)
,
bu becuase tjhe film places its cahracters infront situations
anbd gives them such painful thigsn tothe overcome thta i ' ve frankly nto seen much liek it infront qutie awhile
. at least nto usance tjhe previvous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece
.
