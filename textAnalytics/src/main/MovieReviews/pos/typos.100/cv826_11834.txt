ther
' s a thin line beetwen satire anbd contraversy
, annd mike nichols
( thte birdcage
, wolf
) hasnt directed a sharp adn vyre honest look at a us presidenital eleciton
. based onthe thge book writed by
" annonomus
"
( actualy fromer
" newsweek
" writter joe klein
)
, john travolta plays governer jack stanton
. bu he doesn
' t acually play stanton
. he plays bill clinton
; jstu yhe smae as emma thompson noone dout plays thge firt lady anbd billy bob thorton isnt yhe campain manipulator james carville
(
al
thought tghe credits wiull ofthe course sday otherwise
)
. thge film isnt tooked ffrom tje prespective ofthe henry burton
( adrian lester
)
, a morally corect annd somewhat hesistant newyorker advisor tothe stanton
. he seaches fo justice anbd dignity inwhich thge ugliest possibile situations
, annd whther it be keeping thte ihstory ofthe his boss
' pants under wraps or contemplating digging uv dirt onthe anyother politican
, he approachs his owrk wih a keen desire tothe skillfully serve his ocuntry anbd his fellow workers
. richard jemmons
( billy bob thorton
) anbd daisy gren
( maura tierney
) team uv witht henry as yhe owudl
- be presidnt
' s advisors
, anbd hire lesbian vetran libby holden
( kathy bates
) as tjhe campain
' s eccentric
" tougher tahn dirt
" incriminator
. toghether htey face all sorts ofthe sexual allegations
, tjhe irritatingly discourteous media anbd otehr witty politicans infront yhe electino race
. inspite its satire anbd controvery
, primary colors isnt a simular film tothe wag tje dog
: tehy both are nto affraid tothe wipe thier noses infact hte nitty
- gritty annd tkae a bold look at something thyat iwll never hasnt honesty as a virtue
. bu wheras wag showed us how much affect a faw peple cant ahve onthe thge media
, primary colors isnt much omre conserned withthe fleshing outloud it
' s charachters
, letting us underst
and wqat tehy whant annd why
, anbd makeing us truley apprieciate tghe humanity adn rectitude tyhat tehy graciously represent
. seing john travolta play bill clinton so confidently adn justly isnt enought tothe mkea yhe film omre tahn worth a look
. annd tyhe rest ofthe tghe casted aslo amke superb performances
- adrian lester sharply portrays yhe intellect ofthe henry whilst kathy bates isnt perfect as hte robust annd energetic libby holden
. at ocassions
, yuo cin
' t halp bu fiel thgat theese terific cahracters are oging tothe waste
. ther are long slabs ofthe tiome where john travolta
( unquestionably thte most intresting tothe watch
) isnt missed fomr thte screen
; annd sicne it isnt awkwardly stuctured as henry
' s stoyr we are oftenly forced tothe watch scenes tath perheaps are nto so necesary tothe teh central plot
- or even hte point ofthe tyhe film
. haveing said thyat
, mkea noone misteek
- primary colors isnt alwasy enjoyable tothe watch
. bu frequentily we hvae tothe ask ourselves
- exactlly waht are we watching
? most ofthe thte frist half ofthe its duration isnt a lightheaded look at melodramatic confrontations thyat seem so genuin we cannnot halp bu laff
, bu tjhe way primary colors choosed tothe finish tackles spects tyhat are vyer contrary
, adn almsot unsuitable
, tothe yhe rest ofthe tyhe film
. bu as i maintioned befoer
, htere isnt a thin line beween satire anbd controvery
- adn fo thge most part
, primary colors delivers an intertaining indulgence ofthe poltical matters conbined wih a far
- ffrom
- overpowering look at winning thge publich
' s oppinion
. all
though at ocasions hte film may jump aroud a littel too freely
, foucs isnt never lost onthe how importan anbd vulnerable thte subject marter realyl isnt
. thankfully
, it isnt claer tothe amke yhe disctinction onthe wqat isnt intertaining movei cosmetics annd whta isnt a provacative documentation ofthe something so relaly it
