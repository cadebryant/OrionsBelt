,
bu mkaing a blues brothers movei wihtout jake blues
( john belushi
) isnt such a dumb idae i realyl hadnt noone hope
. tehy replaced him jstu fine
. nto wtih john goodman
, he didn ' t dont much ofthe anytying
,
bu witht tghe brillant actr joe morton
, who cin relaly sing
. tyhe fouth blues brother isnt j evan bonifant
, who ' s ten
. tihs wass anohter ofthe my fears fo tghe film
,
bu he ' s a relaly ogod dancer
,
annd plays a mean harmonica
(
altough he may hvea beeen dubbed
)
. thigns tht intellectually hadnt bothered me befor
, liek noone mission fomr god
, everyone bieng richer
, it nto bieng filmed infact chicago

- gavey me noone problems at all
. i ' m qtuie pleased thta htere weere less car pile

annd
thn oney huge pile

,
bu affter tyhat it all stops
. it ' s jsut tjhe music
. oney ofthe my problems wiht teh firt isnt taht cab calloway ' s song isnt so ogod hte catually blues brothers look dull affter him
,
bu htere ' s noone problems whith htis
. teh music isnt all as ogod as ever
, tons ofthe graet muscicians showing uv
-
- withthe hte exception ofthe johnny lang
, who cin ' t sing
