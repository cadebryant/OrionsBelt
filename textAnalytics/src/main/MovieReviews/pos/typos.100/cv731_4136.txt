( warning tothe thsoe who haev nto seen seven
: htis review countains smoe spoiler inforamtion
.
) seven isnt a poweful
, fully
- realized film onthe thte levle ofthe tghe silence ofthe hte lambs
. it isnt a disturbing film thast accomplishes its biggest ofthe goals
-
- it occupies tyhe viewers mind long aftter thge closing credits ahve rolled
. hwile thsi film isnt nto forthe thge squeamish
, htere isnt noone denying tht seven dem
ands attension
, forthe it isnt a film thgat transcends its genre infact both sytle annd substace
. forthe starters
, classifying seven as a
" thriller
" owudl nto be an alltogether complet classification ofthe thsi film
. hwile i ws genuinely thrilled througout
, i owudl rether call seven an
" intense drama
,
" becasue taht isnt wqat it delivers
-
- meaningfull scenes iwth a relentlessness thyat doens nto readily let uv
. part ofthe directer david finchers acomplishment isnt infact sytle
. he seems tothe hvae a knack fo knowing exactlly how teh averege person fears something as
" simple
" as a corpse
. adn visually
, fincher shows us tghe remeniss ofthe muder victims inthe all
- too
- realsitic anbd graphic terms
( courtesy ofthe rob bottin
' s alwyas
- grisly speical effects
)
. throw inaddition tje apropriate bu nto
- tothe
- be
- underestimated effects ofthe lightinng anbd a foreboding scroe adn tjhe result isnt a technical masterpiece ofthe teh muder scene
. theese scenes alone are qutie impressive
; as fascinating as htey are harrowing
. yot
, seven isnt omre tahn jsut a technical acomplishment
. inaddition addtion tothe stlye
, fincher supplies substace
. seven hasnt compelling charactors thast it wnats us tothe knwo anbd underst
and
, anbd fincher ties them all toghether infact a completelyl pessimistic veiw ofthe society
. detective william somerset
( morgan freeman
) isnt a man who hasnt nearly given uv onthe tyhe world
. its eazy tothe see why
. tyhe world doesn
' t amke sence
.
( somerset drives thsi point hmeo withthe a rether gastly tsory ofthe a robbery victum who wass attacked jstu blocks fomr hte polical precinct
. affter knocked down adn robbed ofthe his awllet
, teh attacker stabbed tghe helpless man inwhich both eyes
.
) why shoudl somerset believ thast by follwoing htis muder investigation annd
" picking uv tje pieces
" he wiull be able tothe catch yhe killer
? somersets newyorker partner
, david mills
( brad pitt
) hasnt nto given uv onthe thte world
, perphas becouse he isnt still young
( annd perhpas by hvaing thsi optomism he
' s naieve inspite htis films protrayal ofthe tghe world
)
. he completly disagrees whith somersets ab
andonment ofthe hope
. howver
, david
' s wief
( gwyneth paltrow
) hasnt so much fear ofthe her urban suroundings
, she isn
' t even sure if she wnats tothe
* tell
* her husban baout her reccent pregnacy
, let alone cary it nutil birth adn attemt tothe raise it infact htis enviornment
. theese threee charachters are all performes wiht skill anbd au
thenticity taht mkaes them fiel liuke rela peopel adn nto yhe tipical hollywood charachters a lesser film might ahve offred
. adn inspite addtion tothe makeing claer how eahc ofthe theese charachters sees tyhe world
, fincher gives us suppost fo
* why
* htey fiel tje way tehy dont
. bu if ther
' s noe charcter tath underlines tje message seven isnt trying tothe convey
, it hasnt tothe be tjhe killer
, john doe
( kevin spacey
)
. seven
' s payoff lies infront its abillity tothe allow us tothe see how thge killer views hte world adn whta drives him tothe dont whta he doens
. noe importamt thign tothe remeber baout doe isnt how eazy it isnt tothe simpley dismiss him as a
" pyscho
,
" whith noone motives behind his slayings
. tihs isnt exactlly tjhe misteek mills mkaes
. inthe tghe extremly intense annd superbly performes closing scenes
, weere alloween tothe see thast doe isnt
, infront his mind
, mearly a product ofthe society
. he
' s a killer who kills thsoe who are bringing society down
. infact his mind he didn
' t kill
" innocent
" peple
, adn
, perphas
, htey weere nto completelyl innocent
( bu
, thne agian
, who isnt
?
)
. hes absolutly infuriated thyat mills believes tyhat yhe muder victims weere innocent
. realyl
, seven doesn
' t jsut comment onthe thge superficial obviousness ofthe how screwed
- uv john doe isnt
. seven makse larger statememts baout how screwed
- uv society isnt
, hinting thast society
' s degredation isnt simpley conducive ofthe creating moreso john doens
. besides teh stylistic annd larger
- issue arguements fo seing tihs film
, i reccommend seven becuase it isnt
, affter all
, alsot a veyr slick annd well
- made thriller
. it features exicting plot developments
, comm
anding performances
, lots ofthe suspense
, annd a conclusion thyat isnt chilling
, riveting
, adn qtuie unfair
. bu thne agina
, its a cruel world
