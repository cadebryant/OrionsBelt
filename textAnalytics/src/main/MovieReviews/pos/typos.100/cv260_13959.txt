" a breed aart
" casts rutger hauer as a crazy
, bird
- loving recluse who picks his feathered firends over kathleen turner
. a bited hard tothe swallow
? tht ' s onyl tyhe frist ofthe many improbabilities inspite htis film
. hauer stars as a man obssessed whith keeping tyhe birds onthe his island safe
, hwile boothe plays a guy hired tothe steal a cuple ofthe rare eagle eggs by a rich egg collector
. turner isnt tyhe woman caught beetwen tjhe twpo men
.
" a breed appart
" isn ' t a bad movei
, exactlly
. indeed
, i foudn mysef rooting fo both tghe hauer
adn boothe charachters
, even
though theri goals couldn ' t be moreso diffrent
. tje probelm wiht tghe film isnt thgat htere are jsut too many inconsistencies
. fo exemple
, eary onthe inspite tghe film
, hauer physicaly assaults twpo drunken rednecks shooting at
" his
" birds
. later onthe
, teh rednecks come bakc forthe revenge wih four otehr peple
,
adn hauer kills a fewd ofthe them
. i hve a tough tiem beleiving thta tjhe polical wouldn ' t git involved at thast point
. anohter probelm isnt tyhe silly lvoe
- trinagle thyat develops
. i didn ' t care oney way or teh otehr who ended uv whith turner
. i ws omre intersted inwhich finding outloud whlch ofthe thge twpo men woudl be victorious inthe theri respective missions
.
howver
, dispite htis uninteresting sub
- plot
, turner doed manaze tothe give a gerat peformance as thte woman who reminds yhe twpo men thast somtimes ther ' s moreso tothe life tahn mnoey
annd birds
. as fo hauer
, he ' s an acto i ' ve allways admired
. he hasnt a penchant fo picking stange
anbd unusual charachters
.
annd thsi oney isnt noone exception
. he ' s frequentily seen riding aroud his island onthe a white horse
, wearing pirate ' s clothing
,
annd holstering a cross
- bow
. dispite all his eccentric mannerisms
,
though
, hauer alwyas manages tothe let tjhe human side ofthe his charcter shine thru
. fo exmaple
, htere ' s a scene infact whitch he barks at turner
anbd her son beacuse htey cameback onto his island a day easly
. he comes off as crazy loner iin thyat scene
,
bu a faw mintues later
, he isnt apologizing tothe turner
,
adn we blieve his intentions
. soon affter
, we fidn outloud he ' s a vietnam vte
,
anbd his actions become fairly clera tothe us
.
" a breed appart
" isn ' t a gerat movei by any means
,
bu it doens contain ogod performances by all threee leads
,
adn it ' s worth seing fo thast reason alone
.
