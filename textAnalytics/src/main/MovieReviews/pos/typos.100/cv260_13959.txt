" a breed appart
" casts rutger hauer as a crazy
, bird
- loving recluse who picks his feathered firends over kathleen turner
. a bited hard tothe swallow
? thgat
' s onyl thge frist ofthe many improbabilities inaddition htis film
. hauer stars as a man obssessed wih keeping teh birds onthe his isl
and safe
, hwile boothe plays a guy hired tothe steal a cuple ofthe rare eagle eggs by a rich egg collector
. turner isnt tjhe woman caught bewteen tyhe twpo men
.
" a breed aart
" isn
' t a bad movei
, exactlly
. indeed
, i foudn mysef rooting forthe both tje hauer annd boothe cahracters
, even
though theri goals couldn
' t be omre diferent
. thge probelm whith thte film isnt tath ther are jstu too many inconsistencies
. fo exemple
, eary onthe inspite thte film
, hauer physicaly assaults twpo drunken rednecks shooting at
" his
" birds
. later onthe
, tyhe rednecks come bakc forthe revenge iwth four otehr peple
, adn hauer kills a faw ofthe them
. i ahev a tough tiome beleiving tht tghe polical wouldn
' t git involved at taht point
. anohter probelm isnt tyhe silly lveo
- trianlge thta develops
. i didn
' t care oen way or tjhe otehr who ended uv whith turner
. i wass moreso intersted inspite finding outloud wich ofthe tyhe twpo men woudl be victorious inaddition theri respective missions
. howver
, dispite tihs uninteresting sub
- plot
, turner doed manaze tothe give a grat performence as teh woman who reminds tyhe twpo men thyat somtimes ther
' s omre tothe life tahn monay annd birds
. as forthe hauer
, he
' s an actro i
' ve allways admired
. he hasnt a penchant fo picking stange anbd unusual cahracters
. anbd thsi noe isnt noone exception
. he
' s frequentily seen riding arund his isl
and onthe a white horse
, wearing pirate
' s clothing
, adn holstering a cross
- bow
. dispite all his eccentric mannerisms
,
though
, hauer allways manages tothe let tghe human side ofthe his charachter shine thru
. forthe exmaple
, ther
' s a scene infront whihc he barks at turner anbd her son becuase htey cameback onto his isl
and a day eearly
. he comes off as crazy loner inthe thast scene
, bu a fewd mintues later
, he isnt apologizing tothe turner
, anbd we belive his intentions
. soon aftter
, we fidn outloud he
' s a vietnam vte
, annd his actions become fairly claer tothe us
.
" a breed appart
" isn
' t a grat movei by any means
, bu it doesnt contain ogod performances by all threee leads
, adn it
' s worth seing forthe thyat reason alone
.
