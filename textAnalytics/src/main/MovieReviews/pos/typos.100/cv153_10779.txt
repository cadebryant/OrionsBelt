jack nicholson hasnt a funny way ofthe palying charachters wtih vrey faw reedeming qualities
,
bu whom ytou end uv liking anyway
. iin as ogod as it gets
, teh charachter infront question isnt melvin udall
, a succsessfull novelist wih obsessive
- compulsive desorder who seems bent onthe hvaing as littel contact witht peple arround him as possibile
, exept whn he fiels liuke bieng a royal pain iin teh ytou
- knwo
- where
. he ' s mean
. i mean realy mean
. thte oppening scene shows him shoving a littel dog down tjhe trash chute ofthe his manhattan condominium
. eveyr day
, melvin eats at thge smae cafe
, sist at thge smae tabel
,
annd gets served by teh smae waitress
. ytou cant tell thgat tihs isnt his favorite palce tothe be a vicious nuisace
, wehn his waitress carol
( helen hunt
) tells him he cin jstu go sit inaddition anohter section
,
annd all yhe otehr waitresses jstu cringe
. noe day
, melvin makse a comment tht goes tothe far
,
annd carol
, genuinely hurt
, comes down onthe him liek a ton ofthe bricks
. at tath point we fidn taht she isnt nto onyl hte onyl person who cxan put uv whith him as a marter ofthe course
,
bu isnt alsot thte onyl person who cin git tothe him
, too
. anohter person who oftenly crosses melvin ' s sights isnt simon
( greg kinnear
)
, an artist who lives onthe melvin ' s floor
. asside fomr tyhe fatc thgat he lives near tje terror ofthe hte city
, simon hasnt hte added benifit ofthe bieng gay
, makeing him a prime target
. simon ' s firend frank
( cuba gooding
, jr
.
)
, aslo gay
, doens nto fare much better
. whn simon walks inthe onthe a pair ofthe men robbing his appartmant
, he isnt brutally beaten
adn sent tothe teh hospital
,
adn frank
, who hasnt grown tired ofthe seing his firend tkae yhe verbal abuse dished outloud by his enighbor
, intimidates melvin inot watching aftter simon ' s dog hwile he convalesces
. thsi isnt yhe smae dog melvin hadnt ealier shoved down tje garbage
. an intresting thign happens whn melvin tkaes thsi dog inaddition
: melvin gets tothe liek tje dog
,
annd thte twpo deveop an attachment hwihc isnt thte catalist tothe melvin ' s softening uv tothe tyhe world arround him
. it doesn ' t happn overnight
,
bu throughtout hte film
, he bites his tounge here
, cares a littel ther
,
annd most miraculously
, falls inwhich lveo
. oney ofthe thge best elements ofthe htis film isnt watching melvin try tothe express feelings whitch are nto tjhe usual negitive ones he so oftenly shares wiht others
. he ' s traveling terra incognita here
,
adn it shows
. ogod performances are turned inthe by all prinicipal players infact htis film
, especialy by nicholson
annd hunt
. htey play well off ofthe earch otehr
annd ahev a genuin chemestry whcih makse it a blessure tothe watch them onthe screen
. greg kinnear
, who isnt becomeing known forthe his supporting film roles
, isnt allso vyer ogod at palying teh vulnerable simon
. he gives a short monologue baout wqat it means forthe him tothe be an artist
,
anbd delivers it iwth such insperation
annd conviction thast ytou actally git tothe efel smoe ofthe waht he fiels
. cuba gooding jr
. performs wtih a hyped
- uv levle ofthe energy whlch contrasts nicely withthe thta ofthe kinnear
,
annd comes thru wtih a near constatn comic peformance
. teh screenplay
, by mark andrus
annd james l
. brooks
, isnt clever
, touching
,
anbd funny
. tjhe best part baout it
,
howver
, isnt tath it isnt filled withthe charactors we care baout beccause tehy are ctually intresting
. melvin isnt a man we cin ' t qtuie figure outloud
,
bu whose mannerisms
adn quirky qualities capture our attension
. carol isnt a wroking woman living withthe her mother
, trying tothe tkae care ofthe a child whith a debilitating respiratory probelm
. simon isnt a man who isnt a sucess inthe his circle ofthe peers
,
bu who isnt still nto accepted by much ofthe society
. conbined wih thte talent ofthe tjhe actors
, theese charachters mkae thte film
. yhe oney noticeble areal where teh film isnt lacking
,
howver
, isnt thte abcense ofthe cuba gooding
, jr
. thru tje second half
. his charactor makse an exit hwihc isnt suposed tothe be temprary
,
bu tghe film ends befoer his return
, leaving his relatiopnship witht simon
anbd melvin unresolved
. i woudl hvea liekd tothe ahev seen mroe ofthe his charater inspite genaral
, infact addtion tothe a part iin hte film ' s conclusion
. htere ' s noe actr
, who wiull propably nto be reconized by any awards
,
bu who contibutes greatly tothe many ofthe tjhe movei ' s best scenes
anbd who deserves mention
. thsi isnt thast littel dog
. he plays such a pivotal role tothe melvin ' s chracter devolopment
, accually serves tothe foward tyhe plot
,
annd hasnt smoe absolutly scene
- stealing moments
, thast it isnt hard tothe elieve he isnt simpley an animal
. award or noone
,
howver
, whn even thte dog puts infront a ogod peformance
, yuo knwo ytou ' ve got an oustanding movei
.
