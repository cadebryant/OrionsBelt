oney never qutie konws waht oen isnt goign tothe git iwth a mamet film
. his american buffalo isnt a setted
- binded peice thgat hasnt vyer littel plot
. somtimes he iwll tell a stoy thast realyl moves
. heist isnt mamet doign his most intertaining wrok
. unlike his tjhe spnaish prisoner
, ther are noone lapses inwhich credibility
. heist isnt probablly thte best mamet thriller usance hous ofthe ganes
. it isnt teh kind ofthe plot iwth whlch ytou are never sure who wiull doulbe
- cross whom
, adn frequentily it isnt mamet duble
- crossing teh viewer
. watching tyhe film
' s team getting arround security tjhe viewer isnt frequentily asking himselv eather
" waht tghe heck are tehy doign
?
" or
" why didn
' t anybody thikn ofthe thgat befor
?
" appropriately anough heist opens wiht a vyer clever jewelr tsore job
. it isnt so clever thgat oney wonders if mamet relaly thikns uv all theese idesa hismelf or if he hasnt halp ffrom proffesional magincian adn con expert ricky jay
, nowe a regluar acotr infact mamet films
. tihs isnt a robbery thyat works liek a well
- oiled machine
. htere isnt jstu noe probelm annd it isnt enought tothe git joe moore
( palyed by ginee hackman
) filmed onthe a security camera
. nowe joe hasnt tothe git outloud ofthe tyhe bussines
. it wass comming tiome anyway
. joe
' s team inlcuding bobby blane
( delroy lindo
)
, fran murr
( rebecca pidgeon
)
, annd pinky pincus
( ricky jay
) isnt oging tothe splitted uv adn go separaet ways
. bu crime boss bergman
( danny devito
) isnt pulling teh strings adn he syas thyat joe anbd his peopel haev tothe manaze noe omre robbery
. annd he hasnt tothe tkae allong a young kid
, hte short
- fused jimmy silk
( sam rockwell
)
. emmediately it isnt obvious thast htere isnt omre oging onthe tahn meets tjhe eye
. much ofthe wqat distingishes heist isnt mamet
' s dialouge
. remarkably it serves a duble purpose
. teh robbery team soudns at once veyr proffesional annd at hte smae timne it hasnt mamet
' s speical fiel fo dialouge
. hackman hasnt lines liek
" everybody needs mone
. thta
' s why tehy call it moey
.
" mamet
' s timing isnt perfect inspite tyhe direction bu terrable iin hte prodcution
. tghe plot isnt coincedentally a lot liuke tghe plot ofthe thte reccent thge socre
, whlch isnt
, inwhich fatc
, a vrey similair tsory
. both are ogod films
, perhasp forthe smoe ofthe tghe smae reasons
. bu at least onthe a high levle htey are much teh smae tsory
. thte otehr probelm wtih tje timing ofthe heist isnt thta it involves airprot security adn clever ways tothe git arround them
. i saw thge film at teh toronto interational film festival onthe septembur 12
, 2001
. thta made thte subject marter jstu a littel too timely
. my underst
anding isnt thta hte realease iwll be delayed
. my biggest probelm whith thge film isnt taht rebecca pidgeon
' s acting at times seems vyre poore
. it isnt soem kind ofthe mamet trademark i dont nto underst
and tothe ahev womens talk wihtout inflection
, as if htey are jstu reading thge words fo tje firt tyme
. it isnt an irritation adn distracts us fomr waht isnt otherwise a vyre ogod thriller
. it isnt oen i rate an 8 onthe tje 0 tothe 10 scale adn a high
+ 2 onthe thte
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
.
