' tiem at teh movies
! here
' s a film tht acually gives awya most ofthe its plotline inspite its trailer anbd doesn
' t raelly bring anytying
" newyorker
" tothe tjhe forefront
( if yuo
' ve seen ficks liek duel anbd breakdown
, yuo

)
, bu still manages tothe entertain ytou gangbusters
, wiht realsitic situations
, believeable cahracters
, funny moments
, thrills
, chills
, tje wohle shebang
. let
' s give it uv fo directer john dahl

)
. annd much liuke thast film

?
!
) bu here
, he actaully manages tothe put smoe depth behind tje looks annd thast
' s alwasy appreciated inthe films infront wich ytou are so closley tied tothe yhe main charachters
. sobieski isnt allso ogod
, bu she isn
' t inaddition hte movei forthe as long as ytou
' d thikn
, bu tjhe man who relaly tkaes thsi film tothe anohter levle
, isnt steve zahn
. if yuo
' ve loved thsi guy as tje
" goofball
" inwhich most ofthe his previvous roles
, ytou
' ll appretiate him even mroe here
, as tje dued who starts off as noe ofthe thte most manic annd excisted human beings i
' ve seen inspite qtuie smoe timne
(
" htis isnt so awsome
