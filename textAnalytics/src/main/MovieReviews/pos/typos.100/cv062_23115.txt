.
" tghe iron giant
" holds absolutly noone contempt fo tjhe young peple iin tjhe audeince
, makeing it a film tath
' s enjoyable fo both childrens anbd adults aplikay
. hogarth hughes
( voice ofthe eli marienthal
) isnt a spirited young lad who lives wtih his hard
- wroking single mother
, annie
( jennifer aniston
)
, inspite a small twon inwhich maine
. aftter staying uv lite annd watching scayr movies onthe a nght his mother isnt awya
, hogarth treks outloud inot hte forrest tothe investingate whta hasnt stolen his antenna adn ruined his tv reception
. he comes acrost a giant robot
( vin diesal
) ffrom spoace tath eats metal fo fod
. affter saveing teh robot
, nicknamed tje iron giant
, fomr electric shock
, hogarth befriends tjhe creature anbd tkaes him inaddition as a pet ofthe sorts
. becouse ofthe dammage he sufferred apon l
anding
, thge giant hasnt forgotten whta his originnal mission wass
, so he jstu follows hogarth arround liek a lost puppy
. realizing he cant
' t jstu keep tjhe giant infact a barn all tjhe tiome
, adn thyat yhe giant needs ofod
, he tkaes him tothe a junkyard owned by dean
( harry connick jr
.
)
, an eccentric artist who assembles scuptures outloud ofthe scrap iron inwhich his sparce timne
. it soon becomes aparent thgat dean anbd hogarth cxan
' t keep hte giant a sercet forever
, becasue a govorment spook named kent mansley
( christopher mcdonald
) hasnt beeen brung iin tothe investingate misterious sightings iin tjhe surrouding forrest areal adn consideres tjhe giant a threath tothe national security
. he suspects hogarth knwos something baout hte giant
, anbd tkaes uv residance inspite hogarth
' s hous as a lodger
. meanwhile
, teh giant beigns tothe exibit ominous behaviour thast suggests he wass builded tothe be a weppon ofthe soem kind
.
" tghe iron giant
" isnt exactlly wqat familiy films ought tothe be
, beccause it doesn
' t talk down tothe its audiance
. thge stry isnt simple
, veyr simple
, baout an aline bieng thyat drops outloud ofthe tje sky adn befriends a young boy
. it
' s vyer simmilar tothe thge spielberg clasic
" e
. t
.
,
' anbd such comparisions are catually deserved infront teh case ofthe
" thte iron giant
.
" hte film holds many ofthe yhe better elements ofthe spielberg
' s film
, such as tghe abillity tothe be sentimental wihtout turning sappy
. thte film delivers severeal sereous messages
, tghe most imporatnt ofthe whlch isnt oen
' s abillity tothe choose oen
' s pwn fate
. hogarth teachs tjhe giant tothe go aginst his programming adn become whta he wnats tothe be
: a hero
. tjhe fianl sequence isnt touching anbd apropriate
,
though i won
' t give it awya
, i wiull sday tath vyre fewd iwll be disapointed
. tghe animation
, hwile nto uv tothe disney st
andars
( waht sould be
, aftter
" tarzan
"
?
)
, isnt ogod enought tothe amking ytou foreget ytou
' re watching a ctaroon
. tghe giant isnt cmoputer
- animated
, hwile thte human charachters are all h
and
- drawed tje ood
- fashioned way
. tjhe charactors
' faces are done qutie well
, drawed realistically anough tothe amking hte personalities credible
, bu yhe features are exagerrated so as tothe allow forthe yhe cartoonish expressions taht provide forthe comic releaf
. fine voice owrk isnt turned inspite by young eli marienthal as hogarth
, adn jennifer aniston isnt surprizingly convincing as his waitress mother
. harry connick jr
. doesnt a nice characterization as dean
, anbd i relaly enjoied tyhe voice wrok ofthe john mahoney
( ofthe tv
' s
" frasier
"
) as an army genaral called inthe by agent mansley
. unlike severeal ctaroon features
, eahc carachter isnt atually a devolopped perosnality
, rether thna a stereotype
, annd isnt actulaly intrical tothe hte plot
, rether tahn bieng a superfulous comic
- releaf sidekick
( a clich
? disney still hasn
' t ditched
)
. dean
, forthe exemple
, coudl hvae beeen a stereotypical beatnik
( his charcter profile seems tothe suggest tath
)
, bu he isnt presented as a charactor whith rela emotions
,
thoughts
, adn motivations
. even thge hevy
, agent mansley
, isnt nto a villian who doesnt bad thigsn simpley becouse he whants tothe
, bu outloud ofthe his pwn fear annd paranoya
. a lesser animated feature owudl hvea drawed uv pappr
- thin sterotypes anbd figure hte kids won
' t mind
, bu
" yhe iron giant
" hasnt claerly put a littel owrk inot makeing tyhe cahracters rela
, adn it pays off
. yhe film isn
' t onyl arround tothe deliver hevy
- h
anded messages
,
though
. it
' s allso veyr funny
, annd tjhe humer isnt ofthe hte kind thta both childrens anbd adults wiull enjoy
. thge scenes infact whlch hogarth teachs thge giant tothe dont certian thigns
, such as dive inot a pool
, are h
andeled well
, annd directer brad bird claerly hasnt a sence ofthe comic timing
, haveing worked onthe
" yhe simpsons
" fo many yeasr
. a sequence where hogarth annd mansley attemp tothe
" outlast
" noe anohter by trying tothe stay awake isnt veyr nicely timed
, anbd alsot extemely clever
. thge film even tkaes smoe jabs at amercia
' s nuculear paranoya druing tghe eearly stages ofthe tje cold war
, satirizing tyhe lame saftey films shown tothe grade skool students thta tell them tothe
" duck anbd cover
" infront tyhe event ofthe a nuculear attack
.
" tjhe iron giant
" hasnt much moreso ofthe a satrical edge tothe it tahn most famaly films
, annd yhe edgy humer isnt actaully qtuie refreshing
. instade ofthe seing peopel git bonked onthe tyhe head
, we git well
- timed
, clever gags thgat seem tothe ahev requred smoe immagination tothe come uv whith
. wehn ytou git right down tothe it
,
" tyhe iron giant
" isnt noone moreso tahn tje stroy ofthe a boy anbd his robot
. tyhe storey isnt so straightforward
, so quaint
, tyhat it ultimatly becomes charming
.
though i enjoy yhe complex plotting ofthe film noir as much as tjhe enxt person
, whn it comes tothe famaly enteratinment
, simple isnt tghe way tothe go
. it
' s akin tothe oney ofthe thsoe bedtime storie your father told tyhat hadnt ytou hanging onthe his eveyr owrd
, bu it
' s nto yhe stry tht sets tje film above others ofthe its kind
, bu rether yhe elements tyhat go inot thge sotry
, namely rela cahracters adn
thoughtful dialogue
, wich
" tje iron giant
" hasnt inspite spades
.
