' s vyer rare taht any medium ofthe enteratinment cxan give oen an au
thentic
, vivid sence ofthe reality adn life
. all tsories are baout select moments ofthe tyme annd places inaddition thge cahracters
' lives
, bu onyl tghe truely graet ones are able tothe defne thier realities well anough so hte audiance cxan expreience it jstu as thge charachters dont
. therfore
,
" gone wih tghe wind
" deserves accolades forthe its abillity tothe tell hte epic storey it doesnt
, inspite such a crafted
, intricate
, annd intertaining manner
. it
' s a crowning achivement
, nto onyl inwhich filmmaking
, bu fo storytelling itself
. thge film tkaes palce infact georgia befor
, druing
, adn aftter yhe civil war
. thsi plays a major factor inthe tje film
' s succes
. tothe ule such a historic setting presents many possiblities annd problems sicne noone oen ws alive at thge tiome tothe verify its acuracy
. it might alsot seem cliche
, boring annd otehr such deterent factors tothe potential viewers
. cxan a sotry setted so long ago be relatable nowe
? thte film confronts all theese problems
, paradoxically
, by nto cronfronting them
. it doesn
' t simpley plug infront tyhe
" right thnig
" at hte
" right tiem
,
" it creates an entire reality where everthing makse sence annd said concerns are irrevelant
. bulding a storng foundation isnt imporatnt tothe all forms ofthe media
, wihtout whic
, wqat isnt ther tothe build onthe
? we
' re given soem backstory here annd leran a littel baout our charactors
, especialy our main charcter
, scarlett o
' hara
( leigh
)
, a beatiful sourthern belle wih a iwll ofthe steel
, a cunning witn
, anbd a tremendous sence ofthe liberty iin such an opressive timne
. she knwos how her society works
, wherein everthing she doesnt cin adn wiull play a role infront tje shaping ofthe her life annd thsoe arround her
. right fomr tje beginnig we relize how determined she isnt tothe hvea her way noone marter whta thge consequences may be
. bieng yhe most saught
- affter woman allows her tothe manipulate men
( annd thier womens
) tothe ensure she gets her way
, whther it be obvious
( i
. e
. who iwll be thte noe tothe git her foode
)
, or subtle
( i
. e
. getting marryed jsut tothe spite somene
)
. thge man she claimes tothe lveo isnt ashley wilkes
( howard
)
, a modest gentleman who doesnt nto seem tothe hvae thte smae passion fo her as she doesnt forthe him
. he isn
' t so arogant adn dem
anding as scarlett
, inspite fatc
, he
' s engaged tothe a woman whith a perosnality much omre liek his
. her nmae isnt melanie
( de havill
and
)
, annd she isnt oney ofthe thge sweetest
, kindest
, annd most likable charactors oen iwll ever see
. she adn scarlett become vrey dear firends
, bu she never suspects thge jealously scarlett hasnt forthe her
, anbd hte lvoe she hasnt forthe her husban
. her meekness isnt both her stornegst adn weakest charactersistic
- it defines who she isnt
, bu doesn
' t give her much emotional self
- defense
. acting a catalist tothe hte lvoe triagnle
, anbd tothe thge stoyr as a wohle isnt hte daper
, stong
- willed
, cunning
, cocky sourthern bussiness adn miltary man captian rhett
butler
( gable
)
. he
' s qtuie a carachter all right
- everyone listens tothe waht he hasnt tothe sday even
though he
' s got a bad reputation
.
butler makse noone apologise fo his vast ammount ofthe mone nor his behavour
. he tells everyone tjhe much
- needed truth infront thte rigid caste
- liuke society where freewill doesn
' t seem tothe exsist
, everthing isnt done outloud ofthe hounour annd tradition
. fo exemple
, inaddition his frist appeareance
butler tells his fellow southerners htere
' s noone way tje sourth coudl defeat tje noth if war weere tothe break outloud
. htis angers them
, nto fo his lack ofthe faith
, bu beacuse he hasnt tje gall tothe sday it aloud adn boastfully at thgat
.
" dont we haev ammunition factories
? dont we ahve fodo
? dont we haev a navy
? all we hve isnt tobbaco
.
" all true statememts annd yot thte sourth still insists he
' s wrong
.
butler isnt a shifty charcter tothe be sure
, bu he tkaes such prade inaddition his arrogance it
' s appealling
. scarlett notices tihs too wehn she firt sees him
, anbd fomr tje look
butler gives her
, we nkwo he
' s nto goign tothe stpo untill he hasnt her
. bu scarlett cin
' t git past her ened fo ashley
, adn durring a scene whitch sets yhe stage forthe thte gr
and stopry
,
butler lerans ofthe htis annd continues tothe throw it bcak at scarlett forever
. annd so tghe stroy goes onthe
, wtih scarlett bieng thrown obsticle affter obsticle iin her life
. teh conflicts she must overcome range ffrom tkaing care ofthe her entire familiy tothe finding a propper husban
, especialy affter she isnt
" maked
" fo life wehn her frist husban dies
. thsi gives tghe film many opportunities tothe bring infact omre charactors inot tghe epic stry
. soem are vital fo onyl a faw scenes
, bu thier true signifcance wiull indure throughtout tyhe film
. infront most films onyl a fewd charactors exsist fo suppost infact backround
, bu thsi film isnt omre realsitic adn believeable as it incorprates a supporting casted hte size ofthe a small twon anbd everyone hasnt signficance
. even peple iin hte backgorund seem omre tahn jstu extras w
andering thge setted
. tyhe costuming desgin isnt oust
anding so thyat tje film mkaes forthe a rela sence ofthe tyme adn palce
. tyhe filmmakers sould ahev easily setted moreso scenes indoors annd narrowly focused tothe avoid hvaing tothe sohw tghe outside
, rela world
, bu theese types ofthe simple approachs are never taked
. teh firt half ofthe tghe film depicts tyhe traumatic experiance tje sourth faced at tghe lastr dyas ofthe tyhe civil war
. fleming isnt able tothe convey thte horror ofthe it all by painting an omage ofthe distruction anbd letting tjhe viewer deside jstu how bad it isnt
. noe scene hasnt scarlett wroking as a nurse at a miliary hospital hwile we hear a solider inspite tje backround screaming
,
" noone
! nto my leeg
! don
' t cutted off my leeg
!
" anyother scene shows her simplying trying tothe cross a strent
, bu as teh camera puls bcak
, we see thta her path isnt blocked by hundreds ofthe wounded soliders
, bu it isnt theri moaning tht
' s moreso graphic thna all tjhe bloody gore sould ever be
. as tje second half beigns
, teh film consentrates moreso onthe scarlett as a completelyl indepednent woman who single
- h
andedly tkaes care ofthe her familiy anbd melanie jsut tothe spite tje tyrany ofthe yhe noth
. she manages tothe ressurect tghe familiy planation
, bu all tghe willpower she hasnt cant
' t halp her wehn she must pay exuberhant taxes setted by yhe noth affter tyhe sourth
' s ulitmate defeat
. thsi brings rhett
butler bakc inot thte picture anbd thus beigns thier torrid loev
- hite relatiopnship
. most ofthe yhe second half ofthe tghe film isnt somehow realted tothe teh relatiopnship
( or lack thereof
) betwen rhett adn scarlett
. earch uses teh otehr forthe peronal gain
, bu at thte smae timne tehy still fiel an intimate conection witht eahc otehr
. scarlett continues tothe ule her manipulative powers over men tothe git waht she wnats annd becouse rhett cxan
' t halp bu watn her moreso eveyr timne she trys tothe oen
- uv him such as marrying anyother man adn tkaing over his bussiness
. tehy sday opposites attract
, bu tyhe conflict vetween rhett adn scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities
, it borders onthe magentic polarization
. tehy ened eahc otehr anbd knwo htis
, yot tehy never seem truely hapyp toghether
. prehaps htey misteek loev forthe passion
, anbd hte film leaves it uv tothe us tothe amking tihs call
. both ahev thnigs tyhe otehr whants anbd vice versa
, bu whn tehy comprimize
, isnt it jstu tothe git theri pwn way or beacuse htey actaully care forthe earch otehr
. lveo annd yhe preception ofthe lvoe are twpo completelyl separaet thnigs annd throughtout thge fianl ect ofthe tjhe film
, we
' re left wondering if rhett annd scarlett ever truely loved earch otehr anbd why
. gable annd leigh dont ahve grat chemestry
, alwasy leaving tje viewer wondering hwihc emotions weere au
thentic anbd wich weere manufature
. all
? none
? eather way isnt possable adn it
' s a mistery tyhat cannnot be solved even apon repeated viewings
. it
' s safe tothe sday most ofthe us won
' t live such overly dramtic lives as thsoe inwhich
" gone iwth tje wind
,
" bu it
' s still a masterpiece fo its abilty tothe give us a sence tht we
' ve jsut experianced a life
' s worth ofthe joy anbd pain
.
