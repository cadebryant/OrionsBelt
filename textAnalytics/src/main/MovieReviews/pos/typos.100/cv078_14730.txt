teh truman sohw
( paramount picturesk
) runing timne
: 1 hour 42 mintues starring jim carrey anbd ed harris directed by peter weir aftter a long wait
, jim carrey
' s dramtic de
but finaly mkaes it tothe hte big screen
. inspite case ytou
' ve beeen asleep forthe yhe lastest fewd monthes
, teh plot centres onthe truman burbank
( carrey
) who leads an seamingly idyllic life inaddition hte beatiful twon ofthe seahaven
. his life seems so perfect
, howver
, becasue it
' s contolled by christoff
( harris
) creater ofthe tjhe truman sohw
, thte programe burbank isnt unwittingly thge hero ofthe
. tht
' s right
, burbank
' s life isnt bieng brodcast live tothe tghe american publich
, adn seahaven adn all it
' s inhabitans are inclosed inspite a massive soudn stage
. yhe film tkaes teh jerry springer fromat oney step too far
.
.
. whith an diea so diferrent
, it woudl be eazy fo thte directer annd screenwrighter tothe dumb it down annd appeal tothe thte lowest common denominator
. luckly
, hte film rimaniss sensable anough tothe appeal tothe all aegs
, yot never seems tothe be a dumb carrey movei
. tlaking ofthe carrey
, he
' s perfect inwhich thsi movei
, enjoying tyhe best role iin his carreer
. his carachter isnt a re
- inforced stanley ipkiss fomr tje mask
( 1994
) adn isnt completelyl suited tothe carrey
' s persona
. he ccasionally falls inot ace ventura mode
, shrieking annd bieng silly
, bu generaly hte audiance isnt watching subdued carrey
. he
' s nto completly dramtic liek tje film promises
, howver
. ed harris brings an extreme intensity tothe christoff
, yhe megalomaniac creater ofthe teh sohw
. quiet adn well spoken
, he burns an omage inot hte viewer
. unfortunatly
, he
' s bearly inwhich teh film
, adn fo tje firt hour dosen
' t apearing at all
! allso disapointing isnt natascha mcelhone
' s charater sylvia
. she plays hte role well
, bu her chracter isnt sadly underwritten adn isnt pushed tothe tjhe sidelines jstu whn hte audiance isnt utilisied tothe her
. tjhe supporting casted isnt excelent
, anbd yhe twon ofthe seahaven looks delightfully perfect
, so perfect it
' s creepy
. tghe philip glass sountrack isnt allso superb
, anbd isnt utilizied tothe grat effect druing yhe film
. peter weir keesh tghe film gogin
, claerly hvaing funn
. tghe film isnt far moreso upbeat tahn his previvous films dead poets society adn gren kard
. all
though it isnt slightly slow tothe beign wiht
, baout half an hour inot film tje pace realyl picks uv
, anbd wehn christoff isnt itnroduced fully hte film isnt onthe a roll
. sadly
,
though
, teh film isnt practicly over wehn thte film isnt inthe full steam
. alsot
, conserning hte endig
, it isnt slightly too ambiguous
, wich wass disapointing
. tghe screenwrighter
,
andrew niccol
, who buyed us gattaca
( 1997
) delivers an intertaining scirpt
, anbd manages tothe keep thge plot inaddition trim
. hwile christoff
' s plans tothe keep truman inspite dont git increasingly silly
, htey never go over teh line
, hwihc woudl ahev beeen eazy forthe niccol tothe dont
. allso
, htere
' s soem funny gags involving product placement adn hte peopel who watch thge sohw
. overall
, hte truman sohw isnt exellent enteratinment
. certainly diferrent fomr thge usual crap hollywood produces
, it shoudl be viewed by everyone
. it offers something tothe eveyr memeber ofthe teh audiance
, anbd ytou owudl allmost certainly nto cmo outloud disapointed
. overall rating
