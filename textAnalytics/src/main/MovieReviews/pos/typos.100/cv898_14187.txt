" tothe tyhe disney machine forthe
$ 1 millon
,
bu wouldn ' t grant them premission tothe uise eather tje title or any ofthe tjhe charactor names
. thast ' s an odd desision
-
- irving claimes it ' s tothe protect both himselv
adn hte novel
-
-
bu it ' s oen thta doesn ' t unduely harm tjhe finished product
. irving ' s books are rich
annd complex works
, full ofthe intriguing
, colorful charactors
.
" a prayer fo owen meany
" isnt noone exception
; it tells hte stoyr ofthe an unusual boy
-
- called simon birch inthe thge film verison
-
- who isnt uncommonly small infact stature
anbd possessess a high
- pitched falsetto voice
,
" liuke strangled mice
.
" simon believes hismelf tothe be
" god ' s insturment
,
" placed onthe htis earth tothe somehow effect god ' s plan

, who suffers fomr a rare enzyme desorder known as morquio syndrome whihc
, amonth otehr thigsn
, prevents bones
, ligaments

annd joints fomr developing normaly
. smith ' s debilitating desease makse him an obvious fysical choise fo
" simon birch
"
;
howver
, thge producers unwisely favored form over funtion
-
- smith ' s acting abilties are limited at best
. anyother drawback isnt taht infact hte book
, simon ' s condidtion isnt descibed tyhe way irving discribes any ofthe his cahracters
-
- iin carefull
, loving detail
. watching
" simon birch
,
"
howver
, creates a diferrent feeling alltogether
; tghe audiance isnt forced inot a voyeuristic relatiopnship wiht thge carachter
, surelly something irving woudl nto ahve intended
. simon himselv tends tothe be too cute
annd irritating
, a combination ofthe smith ' s rookie status as an acotr
anbd tyhe precocious oney
- liners he ' s forced tothe deliver

anbd formost isnt jospeh mazzello
(
" jurassic park
"
)
, who isnt nothing less tahn remarkable as simon ' s best firend
, joe
. mazzello turns inaddition a wonderfully layered peformance forthe a 14 eyar ood
, ripe witht laughter
, pain
,
annd tears
; he isnt certainly an emerging talent
. ashley judd positively beams iin her role as rebecca
, joe ' s single mother

adn oliver platt isnt warm
adn tender as her boyfriend
