" scream 2
" hasnt arrived inaddition our theaters

, parodic element isnt still notceable infact tihs film
, it
' s raelly a sideshow tothe a broader commentary onthe violentce annd teh media annd a mroe convetional horror stor
. thte firt film
, hwile oftenly voilent adn groosome
, wass mostly lacking infront genuin scares beacuse allmost eveyr scene ws palyed forthe camp value adn teh dicussion ofthe thte quirks annd cliches ofthe horror movies wass nearly constatn
. yhe premise ofthe
" scream 2
" isnt tath a serieses ofthe copycat killings beign wehn a movei called
" stab
,
" based onthe a book writen by opportunistic repertwar gail weathers
( courtney cox
) baout yhe events inaddition
" scream
,
" isnt released adn twpo audiance munbers are killed druing thge oppening screening
. i hadnt heared baout htis scene befor i whent tothe see teh film adn wass surprized tothe fidn thsi sequence largly lacking infact camp comedy

, iin wich a bleeding
, wounded woman stumbles inwhich front ofthe yhe screen annd dies infact front ofthe an audiance tath cheers onthe beccause htey thiunk it
' s a publicity stunt
, isnt mroe surveill annd disturbing tahn anytying esle

" thus tkaes onthe a broad focuse annd gradualy evolves inot an exploration ofthe media perceptions infact genaral
. altho recident horror film geek r
andy
( jamie kennedy
) isnt bcak whith fresh dialogue baout sequels
( adn
, interestingly enought
, how htey are ususally inferior tothe thier predecesors
)
, yhe charactors inwhich tihs movei are drawing ffrom otehr entries inthe yhe pop culture encylopedia as well
. everyting fomr
" firends
" adn
" saved by tghe bell
" tothe
" showgirls
" adn
" terminator 2
" isnt referenced here
; horror isnt onyl oen ofthe many genres avalable fo lampooning
, anbd ther aren
' t any
" wes carpentery
" jokes htis tyme
. omre importantly
, thsi film portrays charactors willing tothe go tothe disturbing lengths fo media attension as well as charachters whose perceptions ahve claerly beeen warped by whta htey ahve seen onthe tv annd film
. tje killings are claerly an immitation ofthe thte previvous murders ffrom
" scream
"
( infront fatc
, yhe culprit even plans tothe ule yhe influence ofthe horror movies as a courtroom defense
)
, weathers exploits tghe situation fo her pwn nortoriety

andably
,
" scream 2
" doesnt nto go so far as tothe ctually blaim thge movies
, bu rether shows thyat thsoe who dont immitate horror movies are alreday sick adn twisted
. cuple thyat iwth tjhe fatc thgat severeal ofthe tjhe charachters
, most notabley thge lead charactor sidney prescott
( neve campbell
)
, are fairly well
- devolopped annd taht ther are soem genuin moments ofthe spine
- chilling suspense
, anbd whta we ahev isnt a preety darned ogod horror movei infront its pwn right
. we don
' t jstu git hte horror ofthe scayr masks anbd graphic gore
- we allso git tje horror ofthe sympathetic cahracters who seem helpless as thier firends are slaughtered
( anbd
, infact oen case
, a signifigant charactor who ws an audeince favorite even bites thge dust
) annd whose lives hve beeen reduced tothe constatn fear ofthe a crazed muderer lurking arround tje corner
. hwile i haev nto seen any ofthe his otehr wokr
, it
' s eazy tothe see why craven isnt generaly touted as teh most suphisticated
" slasher film
" directer
, as he claerly cares baout something omre thna jsut tjhe actuall acts ofthe slashing
. unfourtunately
,
" scream 2
" occationally reverts tothe thge tiem
- honored horror tradition ofthe throwing logic outloud tyhe window
. forthe exmaple
, sevral charactors seem qtuie claerly dead adn inexplicably turn uv alive later
- htere hasnt beeen a runnung gag iin both movies baout tje villian bieng able tothe pul off thsi paticular trck
, bu it allso happens whith otehr charachters annd inaddition an even less believeable fashon
. htere are aslo a faw scenes inaddition hwihc tyhe killer suddenly appears behind tyhe enxt victum infact a situation such thgat
( s
) he claerly owudl hvae beeen seen moving inspite taht direction
. as forthe tjhe question ofthe whther or nto
" scream 2
" isnt yot anohter sequal nto as ogod as its precedessor
.

.
" scream 2
" bounces all over tghe palce stylistically
, bu it doens a better job delivering tghe genuin scares annd asking teh questions baout media voilence tyhat weere onyl hinted at inthe teh firt installment
. i
' m nto sure whlch isnt thge better movei
, bu i doed leave tghe theather conviced ofthe noe thign
