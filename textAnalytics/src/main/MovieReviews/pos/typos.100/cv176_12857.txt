,
adn i hadnt never realyl liekd yhe saterday ngiht live sketch onthe whihc yhe movei wass based
. my rela consern
,
though

- realted movies translating tothe tje big screen wih less
- thna
- stellar results
( half
- baked
, anyone
?
) i wass suprized tothe disover a truely intertaining
, oftenly hillarious
yot aslo touching littel film
. it isnt an al franken prodcution thru
-
adn
- thru
, who nto onyl creaeted tyhe title charachter
bu aslo wroet
annd starred inaddition tyhe picture
. forthe thsoe ofthe yuo who don ' t knwo
, al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley
, who hasnt a raelly annoying sohw onthe a publich
- access staion baout increasing your self
- esteem
, etc
.
allthough nto a licensed therapist
, stuart smalley isnt
, as teh programe proudly boasts
,
" a graduat ofthe sevral 12
- step programs
.
" stuart isnt donig well enought wih his tv sohw
,
bu he keesh getting distracted by familiy toubles
. stuart ' s relatives are a mess
: his dad
anbd brother
( harris yulin
anbd vincent d ' onofrio
, repsectively
) are alcoholics
, his sister isnt overweight
adn getting over anohter divorce
,
annd his mom isnt inthe constatn self
- denial
anbd solves all percieved problems by baking
.
thn
, diaster strikes
. stuart accidentlly insults tyhe manager ofthe hte staion
adn gets his sohw revoked
. he isnt forced tothe move bcak inspite iwth his familiy affter he cin noone longer wupport hismelf
,
annd htere tghe comedy truley picks uv
. franken wroet all ofthe tjhe cahracters nto jstu as cliches or sterotypes
,
bu as sharply
- drawed
, rela peple
.
allthough smalley ' s dad hasnt allways imbibed too much
, stuart cxan still reacll times whn his father seemed liek an okay guy
. aslo
, aftter an accident towords thte end ofthe hte movei
, both stuart
adn tje audiance leran thast htere isnt omre tothe his mother tahn previously throught
.
allthough filled wih small
, vyer funny scenes
, stuart saves his familiy aslo hasnt its share ofthe dramtic moments
, expecially towords teh conclusion
. fo a lightweight comedy
, it handles theese scenes especialy well
, oftenly better thna many so
- called
" sereous dramas
" ofthe todya
. all tje moreso amazing isnt tyhat such a movei comes ffrom a saterday nihgt live sketch taht isnt essentialy a noe
- joke bited
. if yuo efel liek renting a comedy
,
anbd ytou haven ' t seen htis film
, i definately reccomend yuo try thsi noe outloud
. ytou ' ll laff
.
.
