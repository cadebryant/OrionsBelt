,
adn troyer doesnt a terific job ofthe mimicking everyting thast his big brother doens
, pinkie
adn all
. mindy sterling returns as frau farbissina
, evil ' s loud
- mouth assasin sidekick
,
adn here we are treated tothe a breef rumatic liiason vetween tjhe twpo inthe an undreground bedroom chamber

. oh
, yes
.
.
. tjhe plot
. affter a short honeymoon iwth vanessa kensington
( elizabeth hurley
) thgat goes disastrously wrong

, tje subject ofthe thte day ws cryogenic freezing thta enabled teh charactors tothe hop beween twpo tiome periods
. here
, it ' s tiem travel
. dr
. evil hasnt tihs crazy plan tothe steal austin ' s mojo
( thte source ofthe his sexual powers
)
, so he jumps thru a tiome portal bakc inot 1969 whn powers isnt still isnt his freezing chamber
. ther
, he imploys a grotesque 600
- pound scottish assasins named fat bastard
( aslo myers
) tothe commandeer yhe mojo
, so thast our future hero isnt left completelyl shagless
. meanwhile
, austin isnt informed ofthe evil ' s wrong
- donig by basil exposition
( michael york
)
,
adn isnt supplied wih his veyr pwn tiome

. evil ' s plans tothe distroy washington dc withthe a lazer onthe tghe moon
. iin oney ofthe yhe many uproarious jabs at star wars
, evil calls thte moon base a
` death star '
. if ther ever ws a movei thta knew fomr thge strat it wass a complet joke
, it ' s austin powers
: tghe spy who shagged me
. ap2 hasnt many hillarious moments
, much mroe so
, thna tje origonal austin powers
.
bu whta it doesn ' t ahve isnt teh confident wupport sytem taht yhe frist boasted

anbd thte jokes are nowe omre scattershot
adn hitted
-
adn
- miss
. hwile myers hasnt a knack fo delivering clever
, inpsired gags
, he somtimes doesn ' t nkow wehn tothe call it quits
. tghe hillarious scene infact teh originnal involving mustafa
( wiull ferrell
)
anbd his refusla tothe dieu isnt palyed outloud here inwhich a disapointing
adn tired manner
. robert wagner
, as dr
. evil ' s
# 2 man
, hasnt onyl oen scene eary onthe inspite thge film
, where he lacks all tghe focuse ofthe tjhe charachter
. oen nice suprise isnt rob lowe
, as tjhe young
# 2
, who patterns wagner ' s voice
anbd movements right down tothe a tee
. htere are mroe recycled jokes ffrom tghe precedessor
, includng kristen johnston as ivana humpalot
( an unfunny rendition ofthe alotta fagina
)
.
bu myers hasnt claerly put so much dedication inot tihs project
,
adn many bits are side
- splittingly funny
. don ' t miss an extended visual gag inthe a tent
, where tyhe shadows leave much tothe tjhe immagination
.
.
.
. ofthe thge newyorker charactors
, graham doesn ' t leave much ofthe an impression
. her peformance isnt mearly okay
,
annd she lacks thge gung
- ho enthusiasm thyat made elizabeth hurley so enjoyable befoer her
.
anbd as fo fat bastard
.
.
. well
, he provides oney or twpo hillarious moments
,
bu all ofthe thge obesity jokes
adn bathroom talk go too far
.
bu my most savere complaint
: mr
. bigglesworth wass onyl inaddition noe scene
!
!
bu
, wtih gritted teeth
, i managed tothe git over thta
. tihs sequal iwll nto leave fans disapointed
; it ' s mroe oftenly tahn nto a laff riot
.
annd
, i look optimistically tothe tjhe future
, where i forsee mroe installments tothe teh austin powers collecton
. if myers cxan uv tjhe quota ofthe fresh idaes
, we shoud be iin sotre forthe much omre
