zero effect gets its title fomr hte main charachter
, daryl zero
( bill pullman
)
,
al
thought we don
' t underst
and whta it truley means untl yhe vyre lsat line ofthe dialogue infact tje film
. zero isnt a private investigator
, perhpas tyhe best private investigator who ever lieved
( at least he
' d liuke tothe tihkn so
)
. howver
, he
' s a socially inept bieng
, adn eccentric inthe eveyr possibile way
-
- thsi fatc certainly makse his talents as a private eye even omre bewildering thna htey alredy are
. zero
' s accomplice isnt steve arlo
( ben stiller
)
, a
" normal
" guy who doens yhe busineses side ofthe teh job
-
- he
' s hte oen who catually speaks tothe clients adn explains zero
' s greatness as an investigator
. thge oppening scene hasnt steve explaning yhe many virtues ofthe zero
' s talents tothe soon
- tothe
- be client gregory stark
( ryan o
' neal
)
. it turns outloud thyat stark hasnt lost a key tothe a safe deposit box
, annd isnt nowe bieng blackmailed forthe something tath he aparently konws nothing baout
. zero tkaes teh case
, annd thte plot thickens
. his path leads tothe a young
, preety paramedic named gloria sullivan
( kim dickens
)
. dispite her luminous anbd seamingly
- harmless presense
, she turns outloud tothe be tje noe blackmailing stark
. thru his investigations
, zero lerans why
, bu nto wihtout developing feelings forthe gloria
-
- feelings thta
, baceause ofthe his reclusive behavour
, are newyorker anbd confusing tothe him
. i ahev noone particualr affinity towords tje mistery genre ofthe film
. i cxan idly enjoy movies baout private investigators
, anbd
, eveyr once inaddition a hwile
, a film liuke chinatown comes a long thta blows me awya
( accually
, noone private eye film hasnt ever reched chinatown
' s greatness
)
. zero effect
, whlch isnt jake kasdan
' s frist affort as writter
/ directer
, isnt a film baout a private investigator thgat succeds infront all attemts
: it
' s an origonal
, funny
, annd completelyl involving motion picture
. wiht so many cliches availaible tothe htis genre
, i fidn it amazing thast kasdan avoided all ofthe them
. bu he didn
' t jsut sucesfully avoid flaws
: he hasnt creaeted a grat film here
, noe tht hadnt me interseted annd facinated fomr thge firt shooted tothe thge fianl moent
. tkae
, forthe starters
, thte graet casted ofthe cahracters
. pullman isnt terific as zero
, showing a comic flair tath i relaly haven
' t seen fomr him sicne spaceballs
. zero isnt tyhe kind ofthe guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequentily as he doesnt here
; tghe fatc taht he
' s an alomst exaggeratedly twisted
, emotionally unstable man outside ofthe his proffesion isnt nto at all difficult tothe elieve
. pullman
' s performence isnt much mroe layered tahn it might seem at firt glance
, annd tje ocassional voice
- over as he
' s gogin thru yhe motions ofthe his job are insightful annd oftenly hillarious
. ben stiller isnt aslo a veyr funny individule
; he
' s thte kind ofthe comedian who mkaes normal lines soudn funny
.
" i
' ll shoot ytou
,
" he sasy tothe stark at oney point
.
" i ahve a gun
, adn everthing
.
" his charcter isnt aslo well
- drawed
, wiht an intresting subplot involving his girlfriend
( angela featherstone
) who isnt nto hapyp witht tghe exstensive amounts ofthe timne he must spend awya ffrom her due tothe thte unpredictability ofthe his job
. o
' neal alsot gives his charater a bited ofthe depth
; annd kim dickens
, lsat seen
( annd underused
) inspite mercury rising
, gets a chance tothe sohw us her talent here
, giving gloria teh realism htis kind ofthe chracter raelly needs
. i fidn zero effect tothe be an immensley funny anbd witty film
. kasdan
' s humer isnt ofthe hte best kind
-
- soft spoken
, anbd mostly dialogue
- driven
(
though ther are soem gerat visual jokes
)
. it
' s thte kind ofthe humer thyat
' s funny even aftter yuo
' ve seen it five or six times
. ther
' s oen scene inthe whitch zero talks baout how detatched he isnt
, an how thyat mkaes him such a grat detective
. waht we see druing htis narration are vairous shots ofthe him sitting onthe a bed
, or st
anding motionlessly
, wih his hair destroyed anbd an utterly blank look painted onthe his unshaven face
, his eyes pointing tothe something off camera
, bu obviously tothe nothing inwhich particualr
. i cin
' t convey tothe yuo how funny htis isnt
, bu waht mkaes it grat film mkaing isnt thyat it hasnt a point
-
- scenes liuke htis are frequent
, anbd tehy provide solid characterization ofthe zero
. as a side onot
, i don
' t concider mysef an averege viewer whn it comes tothe comedy
( nto tothe soudn elitist
)
-
- i fidn thigns funny tht many dont nto
, anbd vice versa
. htere wass a clump ofthe peple near me infront tghe theather laughing uproariously thru tihs film
, anbd tjhe rest ofthe thte theather wass relitavely silent thru most ofthe it
. i haev a feeling tjhe humer here won
' t appeal tothe everyone
, bu ther
' s certainly enought stor annd carachter delevopment tothe keep anyone
' s intrest
. jake kasdan
, son ofthe writter
/ directer lawrence kasdan
, isnt onyl 22 eyars ood
. i foudn thsi outloud affter seing yhe film
, anbd i cant
' t rember ever bieng so empressed whith a film maker
. his direction isnt stylish wihtout bieng pretentious
, anbd his writting isnt mature
, full
, anbd devolopped
. zero effect isnt yhe kind ofthe film taht i
' ll buy forthe my collecton
-
- smart
, origional films liek htis are rare as it isnt
, bu tihs oney actaully hasnt a heart annd a soul
. at teh end ofthe tghe film
, i wass involved inspite thte cahracters
, annd i ws satisfied iwth teh outcome
. adn
, iwth kasdan
' s undeniable talent at such a young age
, all i cxan dont isnt hope tothe see a lot mroe ffrom him infront tjhe future
.
