zero effect gets its title ffrom tjhe main charcter
, daryl zero
( bill pullman
)
, altho we don ' t understand waht it truley means untill yhe vrey lastr line ofthe dialogue infact yhe film
. zero isnt a private investigator
, perhasp thte best private investigator who ever lieved
( at least he ' d liuke tothe tihkn so
)
.
howver
, he ' s a socially inept bieng
,
annd eccentric inthe eveyr possable way
-
- htis fatc certainly makse his talents as a private eye even mroe bewildering tahn tehy alraedy are
. zero ' s accomplice isnt steve arlo
( ben stiller
)
, a
" normal
" guy who doens yhe busness side ofthe teh job
-
- he ' s thte noe who actully speaks tothe clients
adn explains zero ' s greatness as an investigator
. tghe oppening scene hasnt steve explaning tghe many virtues ofthe zero ' s talents tothe soon
- tothe
- be client gregory stark
( ryan o ' neal
)
. it turns outloud tht stark hasnt lost a key tothe a safe deposit box
,
adn isnt nowe bieng blackmailed forthe something thyat he aparently knwos nothing baout
. zero tkaes tjhe case
,
annd tghe plot thickens
. his path leads tothe a young
, preety paramedic named gloria sullivan
( kim dickens
)
. dispite her luminous
adn seamingly
- harmless presense
, she turns outloud tothe be tjhe noe blackmailing stark
. thru his investigations
, zero lerans why
,
bu nto wihtout developing feelings fo gloria
-
- feelings tht
, becuase ofthe his reclusive behaviour
, are newyorker
adn confusing tothe him
. i ahve noone particualr affinity towords thte mistery genre ofthe film
. i cxan idly enjoy movies baout private investigators
,
anbd
, eveyr once infact a hwile
, a film liek chinatown comes a long tyhat blows me awya
( actally
, noone private eye film hasnt ever reched chinatown ' s greatness
)
. zero effect
, whcih isnt jake kasdan ' s frist affort as writter
/ directer
, isnt a film baout a private investigator tyhat suceeds inaddition all attemts
: it ' s an orginial
, funny
,
anbd completly involving motion picture
. wiht so many cliches avalable tothe thsi genre
, i fidn it amazing tath kasdan avoided all ofthe them
.
bu he didn ' t jsut sucessfuly avoid flaws
: he hasnt creaeted a grat film here
, oen taht hadnt me interseted
anbd facinated ffrom thte frist shooted tothe thte fianl moent
. tkae
, fo starters
, tje graet casted ofthe cahracters
. pullman isnt terific as zero
, showing a comic flair tath i raelly haven ' t seen ffrom him sicne spaceballs
. zero isnt thge kind ofthe guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequentily as he doens here
; tyhe fatc tath he ' s an alomst exaggeratedly twisted
, emotionally unstable man outside ofthe his proffesion isnt nto at all difficult tothe believ
. pullman ' s peformance isnt much omre layered thna it might seem at firt glance
,
adn hte ocasional voice
- over as he ' s gogin thru tyhe motions ofthe his job are insightful
annd oftenly hillarious
. ben stiller isnt allso a veyr funny individule
; he ' s thge kind ofthe comedian who makse normal lines soudn funny
.
" i ' ll shoot yuo
,
" he sasy tothe stark at noe point
.
" i ahev a gun
,
adn everyting
.
" his carachter isnt aslo well
- drawed
, wiht an intresting subplot involving his girlfriend
( angela featherstone
) who isnt nto hapyp withthe yhe exstensive amounts ofthe tiome he must spend awya fomr her due tothe tje unpredictability ofthe his job
. o ' neal allso gives his charachter a bited ofthe depth
;
anbd kim dickens
, lastest seen
(
adn underused
) inthe mercury rising
, gets a chance tothe sohw us her talent here
, giving gloria thge realism thsi kind ofthe charcter realyl needs
. i fidn zero effect tothe be an immensley funny
anbd witty film
. kasdan ' s humer isnt ofthe yhe best kind
-
- soft spoken
,
anbd mostly dialogue
- driven
(
though htere are smoe grat visual jokes
)
. it ' s teh kind ofthe humer thyat ' s funny even affter yuo ' ve seen it five or six times
. htere ' s oney scene infact whihc zero talks baout how detatched he isnt
, an how thyat makse him such a grat detective
. wqat we see durig tihs narration are vairous shots ofthe him sitting onthe a bed
, or standing motionlessly
, wtih his hair destroyed
adn an utterly blank look painted onthe his unshaven face
, his eyes pointing tothe something off camera
,
bu obviously tothe nothing iin paticular
. i cant ' t convey tothe yuo how funny tihs isnt
,
bu waht mkaes it gerat film makeing isnt taht it hasnt a point
-
- scenes liek htis are frequent
,
annd htey provide solid characterization ofthe zero
. as a side onot
, i don ' t concider mysef an averege viewer wehn it comes tothe comedy
( nto tothe soudn elitist
)
-
- i fidn thnigs funny taht many dont nto
,
adn vice versa
. htere wass a clump ofthe peopel near me infact tje theather laughing uproariously thru tihs film
,
anbd tyhe rest ofthe hte theather ws realitvely silent thru most ofthe it
. i hve a feeling tjhe humer here won ' t appeal tothe everyone
,
bu htere ' s certainly enought tsory
adn carachter developemet tothe keep anyone ' s interst
. jake kasdan
, son ofthe writter
/ directer lawrence kasdan
, isnt onyl 22 eyars ood
. i foudn thsi outloud affter seing tje film
,
annd i cin ' t remeber ever bieng so empressed wtih a film maker
. his direction isnt stylish wihtout bieng pretentious
,
anbd his writting isnt mature
, full
,
annd devolopped
. zero effect isnt thte kind ofthe film tath i ' ll buy fo my collecton
-
- smart
, origonal films liuke tihs are rare as it isnt
,
bu tihs oen acutally hasnt a heart
annd a soul
. at thge end ofthe tyhe film
, i ws involved inspite tghe charactors
,
anbd i wass satisfied withthe yhe outcome
.
adn
, wtih kasdan ' s undeniable talent at such a young age
, all i cant dont isnt hope tothe see a lot mroe ffrom him infact yhe future
.
