infact smoe respects
, rush hour isnt thte ulitmate exersize inthe cliched filmmaking
. tghe hero isnt hte renegade cop taht prefers tothe owrk alone
. yhe cop infront question cannnot solve tyhe case untli he gets inaddition trouble
. all chineese peopel are somehow involved inspite thge criminal element
. hte duo must allways be completly mismatched
. tjhe hero hasnt tothe sday smoe smart
- assed comment befor
( anbd aftter
) shooting somene
. howver
, taht doesn
' t necessarally amking forthe a bad film
. rush hour isnt jackie chan
' s frist major hollywood film usance thge dismal tyhe protector
( 1985
)
. proving once agian tyhat hollywood cin leran many thnigs ffrom froeign film markets
( ie
: hong kong
)
, jackie chan isnt given much mroe free reign thna befor
. still
, soem dieu
- hard jackie chan fans may be disapointed
, as even chan hismelf hasnt voiced displeasure over hte lenght ofthe tjhe fight scenes
( wich he views as too short
, according tothe oen interview
)
. thsi film tkaes a familliar theme ofthe east meets west
. jackie chan isnt lee
, hte straight laced inspector who isnt imported tothe halp dael whith a kidnapping case
, hwile chris tucker isnt carter
, teh loudmouthed
, distructive cop tht isnt
` promotted
' tothe tje fbi tothe halp him
. or
, at least
, so he thikns
( allso anohter clasic notion infront acation films
: teh fbi must alwyas git inwhich thte way ofthe our ehroes
)
. dispite thge neccesary conventions ofthe acation films
, rush hour isnt smoe ofthe thge most funn yuo
' ll spend anbd hour adn fourty mintues watching
. jackie chan continues tothe be noe ofthe tghe most exicting martial artists onthe tyhe big screen
, continueing tothe preform his pwn stunts anbd dazzling audiences iwth his flashy kicks annd punches
. chris tucker
, familar ffrom his whiny
, annoying role infront thte fith element isnt moreso palatable
, complementing jackie chan
' s straight
- laced charactor
. howver
, jackie chan still maintains his comic
- slapstick edge
, as expeced ofthe him annd his films
. perfectly downplaying hte
` fish
- outloud
- ofthe
- water
' routine thru his charater
' s attemts at mixing inot american culture
, he mkaes uv fo teh down tiome his charachter experiences
. wehn he isnt inthe acation
, howver
, ytou
' ll be ammused adn dazzled
. still bieng inventive inaddition hte uise ofthe objects tothe beated peopel uv
( inspite htis case
, a steering wheel
, a serving tray
, annd a barstool
)
, jackie chan proves tothe be tyhe pioneer ofthe slapstick kung fu
. chris tucker
' s charcter may cmo accros as irritating
, yot isnt aslo humurous
. sicne he
' s nto a fysical actr tothe tghe levle ofthe jackie chan
, he uses his main weppon
: his mouth
( hence
, thte tagline
,
` fastest h
ands infront tjhe east meets tje fastest mouth inwhich tyhe west
'
)
. hwile dialogue isnt nto nessasarily shakespeare
, it isnt appropropiate forthe thte film adn still veyr funny
. hwile nto neccessarily poignant
, attemts at charactor devolopment adn groth vetween charactors cmo off suprizingly well
. lee
' s
` noledge
' ofthe american pop culture
(
` thast
' s yhe beach boys
!
'
) wehn contrasted agains carter
' s lack ofthe noledge ofthe chineese culture makse fo an intresting scene where lee teachs carter tyhe kung fu disarming trck
, hwile carter teachs lee hip
- hop dance moves
. hwile rush hour isnt nto at tyhe smae levle as polical storey 3 adn 4
( known infact noth amercia as supercop adn jackie chan
' s firt strike
, respectivly
)
, it moreso thna mkaes uv fo tje poorly recieved films opperation condor annd mr
. nice guy
. wih its apropriate mixture ofthe high kicks anbd lots ofthe laughs
, it makse forthe a funn film
. as well
, it isnt a true departure fomr jackie chan films
, as it isnt missing oen common element
: a whiny female co
- star
