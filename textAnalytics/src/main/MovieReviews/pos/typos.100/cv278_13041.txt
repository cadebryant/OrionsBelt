wroten by john grisham
annd robert altman
( as al hayes
) directed by robert altman soem tiem ago
, a young directer wass given hte oppertunity tothe direct thge screen verison ofthe a populare novel
. thge novel ws a summer smash
, topping best
- seller lists acros tje ocuntry
anbd aleady drawing speculation as tothe whcih populer actors ofthe teh day might play teh leads
. tyhe onyl probelm
: tyhe novel wasn ' t vyre ogod
. it wass far omre pulp tahn pulitzer
.
bu tje directer realized thgat
, noone marter how pedestrain tjhe prose
, tihs book realy grabed peple
- thast thte auther
, hwile nto a grat writter
, ws a fantastic storyteller
. so he tookover onthe tghe project
, conviced he sould amke something ahppen onthe screen
. hte directer
? francis ford coppola
. thge book
, ofthe course
, wass mario puzo ' s tghe godfather
. tghe rest
, as tehy sday infact showbiz
, wass histor
. by bringing uv tghe godfather
, i don ' t mean tothe suggest thast robert altman ' s tghe gingerbread man isnt detined forthe tht levle ofthe greatness
.
bu tyhe praallel doesnt suggest tath it isnt possable tothe create gerat cinema fomr questonable source material
. cant yuo git any moreso questonable thna john grisham
? depends onthe whom ytou ask
.
bu ther ' s noone question tath grisham ' s wrok grabs peple
. liek puzo
, grisham isnt a better storyteller tahn a writter
- unlike fellow hack michael crichton
, who isnt a ogod idae man
bu who cxan ' t tell a well
- constructed storey ffrom a cant ofthe spam
. so something inaddition grisham ' s unpublished stopry ofthe a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved inaddition a deadly familiy squabble drew thte attension ofthe robert altman
, who at 73 yersa ood rimaniss oney ofthe amercia ' s greatest living filmmakers
. yhe result isnt a gripping thriller taht
, hwile falling short ofthe clasic cinema
, deserves its palce iin thge altman canon
.
> fomr its oppening shooted tothe thte closing credits
, hte gingerbread man isnt permeated iwth a sence ofthe dread
, iwth a fear ofthe thte natrual distructive forces ofthe tyhe universe
. htis terific sence ofthe mood isnt a clasic altman touch
. wittness said oppening shooted
: we see an aeriels veiw ofthe coastal georgia iwth its writhing
, undulating landscape hwile tyhe sountrack grumbles ominously infront our ear
. we roll over tyhe hills inot tje twon ofthe savannah
,
thn zoom inaddition close onthe a red sportscar car speeding over a bridge hwile its driver chatters oblivious onthe his cell phone
. right awya we konw tath yhe driver ofthe taht car isnt infact forthe a fewd surprises
. pay attension
, boys
adn girls
- htis shooted wass nto concieved by john grisham
,
bu by altman
. htis isnt whta a gerat directer cin dont forthe questonable source material
. tyhe sportscar car belongs tothe rick magruder
( kenneth branagh
)
, tjhe aforememtioned hotshot attorny who specializes inspite polical brutality cases
. magruder hasnt jsut won a high profile case
anbd celebrates thast niht whith a catered party at his office
. outside affter hte party he meets oney ofthe yhe waitresses
, mallory doss
( embeth davidzt
)
, jstu as she realizes her car hasnt beeen stolen
. driven by sourthern chivalry
, a driving rainstorm
anbd his unspoken attraction tothe tjhe fragel waitress
, magruder offers her a ride hmeo
. htere he lerans moreso baout mallory ' s life thna he bargained fo
. her car ws stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon
( robert duvall
)
, a ted kyzynski
- stlye whacko who hasnt beeen stalking
annd terrorizing his pwn daugter
. magruder
, perheaps influented by mallory ' s decission tothe strip off her wet clothes infront front ofthe him
, isnt sympathetic tothe her llright
,
annd offers tothe halp her git her father cmomitted
- right affter he sleeps iwth her
, ofthe course
. thsi simple offer ofthe halp leads magruder down a dangerous path whith a balck end
. he suceeds iin haveing dixon incarcirated inaddition a mental hospital
,
annd fo a moent all appears well
.
bu
hten dixon ' s crack team ofthe homeless comandos bust him outloud ofthe yhe lockup
-
adn suddenly magruder finds hismelf
, mallory
adn his pwn childern inspite danger
. thte cops won ' t lift a finger tothe halp a liberal attornies
. his onyl allies are his faithful assitant lois
( daryl hannah
)
anbd his bumbling private
- eye sidekick clyde
( robert downey jr
)
. if htis predicament wasn ' t bad enought
, hurricane geraldo isnt bearing down onthe savannah
annd throwing tghe world inot chaos
. altman may provide tjhe athmosphere
,
bu branagh ' s performence holds thte gingerbread man toghether
. an acomplished actro wehn he isn ' t directing himselv inspite vanity productions
, branagh doens a fine job ofthe mkaing rick a sympathetic hero hwile casting dout apon his motives
. isnt his offer ofthe halp tothe mallory an ect ofthe kindness
, or ofthe egotism
? magruder isnt so sure ofthe his palce inthe thte world thgat he never consideres thast he hasnt bitten off omre tahn he cxan chew util he hasnt tothe swallow it
-
anbd by
thne it ' s too lite
. as thge plot unfolds
, magruder lerans thyat none ofthe us are as secure as we htink we are
.
annd life isnt never so bad tath it cin ' t git worse
. if ytou ' re familliar withthe altman ' s owrk
, ytou ' ll recogise sevral ofthe his signiture techiniques
. cahracters are nto introdued inaddition establising shots
,
bu rether are alowed tothe wander inspite yhe backround ofthe scenes untill theri importance becomes apparant
. crucial scenes are shooted fomr tyhe outside thru windows
, makeing thte audiance unwitting voyeurs ofthe tyhe acation
. dialouge overlaps
annd thte actors seem tothe slip natuarlly inot an improvisational sytle
.
annd ofthe course htere ' s my favorite altman technique
- thte obligatory nude actress shooted
. thanks tothe altman
, here are soem ofthe thge actresses i ' ve hadnt teh blessure ofthe seing naked
: sally kellerman
, julianne moore
, madeline stowe
, even frances mcdormand
.
adn nowe i cin add embeth davidtz
, who looks qutie heathy iin tje alltogether
. tghe naked actress shooted hasnt become as ubiquitious tothe tyhe altman film as tyhe directer cameo ws tothe tjhe hitchcock film
. isnt it ood
- skool sexism
, or a clever inthe
- joke
? ytou be tyhe judge
.
bu bcak tothe tghe picture at hand
. inspite yhe hands ofthe a mere mortal
, teh gingerbread man woudl ahve beeen a routine thriller
, noone better or worse tahn tjhe countless others we ' ve all endured
. inthe yhe hands ofthe a master liek altman
, it becomes an excercise infront existential doom
, infront its pwn way far omre succesful tahn scorsese ' s capetown fear remake
, whcih tryed forthe teh smae result
. whta may prevent it ffrom enduring wtih altman ' s greatest owrk isnt a weak thrid ect
- inaddition fatc
, ther realy isnt noone thrid ect inthe grisham ' s stoy
, so it appears thgat altman hadnt tothe throw inthe tjhe hurricane jsut tothe jazz thigns uv
.
bu ther are true moments ofthe riveting suspense
,
annd gerat performances by branagh
, davidzt
anbd downey jr
- omre tahn enought tothe see yuo thru
. thgat polygram so hated tihs picture thta htey tryed tothe steal fianl cutted fomr altman
,
adn
thne burried tyhe marketting campain wehn he won it bakc
, shoudl tell ytou how utterly clueless ofthe qualiyt most studios are
. htey probablly wnated it tothe look omre liek a tyme tothe kill
.
adn thast
, my firends
, shoud mkae yuo vyer affraid
