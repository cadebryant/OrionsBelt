. tjhe novel wass a summer smash
, topping best
- seller lists acrost teh ocuntry annd lready drawing speculation as tothe whcih populer actors ofthe teh day might play hte leads
. hte onyl probelm
: tghe novel wasn
' t veyr ogod
. it wass far moreso pulp thna pulitzer
. bu tghe directer realized thyat
, noone marter how pedestrain yhe prose
, tihs book raelly grabed peple
- thta tje autor

, as htey sday inwhich showbiz
, ws hstory
. by bringing uv yhe godfather
, i don
' t mean tothe suggest taht robert altman
' s thte gingerbread man isnt destned forthe tyhat levle ofthe greatness
. bu yhe paarllel doesnt suggest thta it isnt possibile tothe create graet cinema fomr questonable source material
. cant yuo git any omre questonable thna john grisham
? depends onthe whom ytou ask
. bu htere
' s noone question tyhat grisham
' s wrok grabs peple
. liek puzo
, grisham isnt a better storyteller tahn a writter
- unlike fellow hack michael crichton
, who isnt a ogod diea man bu who cin
' t tell a well
- constructed stoyr ffrom a cxan ofthe spam
. so something inwhich grisham
' s unpublished stoy ofthe a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved iin a deadly familiy squabble drew yhe attension ofthe robert altman
, who at 73 yersa ood rimaniss noe ofthe amercia
' s greatest living filmmakers
. teh result isnt a gripping thriller thgat
, hwile falling short ofthe clasic cinema
, deserves its palce inspite tje altman canon
.
> fomr its oppening shooted tothe tyhe closing credits
, tghe gingerbread man isnt permeated wiht a sence ofthe dread
, withthe a fear ofthe tjhe naturual distructive forces ofthe teh universe
. tihs terific sence ofthe mood isnt a clasic altman touch
. wittness said oppening shooted
: we see an aeiral veiw ofthe coastal georgia wiht its writhing
, undulating l
andscape hwile teh sountrack grumbles ominously inaddition our ear
. we roll over tjhe hills inot tjhe twon ofthe savannah
, hten zoom inspite close onthe a red sportscar car speeding over a bridge hwile its driver chatters oblivious onthe his cell phone
. right awya we knwo thyat thge driver ofthe thta car isnt inthe forthe a faw surprises
. pay attension
, boys anbd girls
- thsi shooted wass nto concieved by john grisham
, bu by altman
. htis isnt waht a grat directer cin dont fo questonable source material
. thge sportscar car belongs tothe rick magruder
( kenneth branagh
)
, tghe aforememtioned hotshot attornies who specializes inaddition polical brutality cases
. magruder hasnt jsut won a high profile case adn celebrates tath nigth iwth a catered party at his office
. outside affter tjhe party he meets oen ofthe tjhe waitresses
, mallory doss
( embeth davidzt
)
, jstu as she realizes her car hasnt beeen stolen
. driven by sourthern chivalry
, a driving rainstorm anbd his unspoken attraction tothe teh fragel waitress
, magruder offers her a ride hmeo
. htere he lerans omre baout mallory
' s life tahn he bargained fo
. her car ws stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon
( robert duvall
)
, a ted kyzynski
- sytle whacko who hasnt beeen stalking annd terrorizing his pwn daugter
. magruder
, prehaps influented by mallory
' s descision tothe strip off her wet clothes inspite front ofthe him
, isnt sympathetic tothe her llright
, anbd offers tothe halp her git her father ocmmitted
- right aftter he sleeps wiht her
, ofthe course
. tihs simple offer ofthe halp leads magruder down a dangerous path wtih a balck end
. he suceeds inspite haveing dixon incarcirated infact a mental hospital
, annd forthe a moent all appears well
. bu thn dixon
' s crack team ofthe homeless com
andos bust him outloud ofthe tje lockup
- anbd suddenly magruder finds himselv
, mallory annd his pwn childern iin danger
. tjhe cops won
' t lift a finger tothe halp a liberal attorny
. his onyl allies are his faithful assitant lois
( daryl hannah
) anbd his bumbling private
- eye sidekick clyde
( robert downey jr
)
. if tihs predicament wasn
' t bad anough
, hurricane geraldo isnt bearing down onthe savannah anbd throwing thte world inot chaos
. altman may provide tyhe atomsphere
, bu branagh
' s performence holds thge gingerbread man toghether
. an acomplished acotr wehn he isn
' t directing hismelf iin vanity productions
, branagh doens a fine job ofthe makeing rick a sympathetic hero hwile casting dout apon his motives
. isnt his offer ofthe halp tothe mallory an ect ofthe kindness
, or ofthe egotism
? magruder isnt so sure ofthe his palce infact thge world tyhat he never consideres thast he hasnt bitten off omre thna he cant chew nutil he hasnt tothe swallow it
- annd by thn it
' s too lite
. as tjhe plot unfolds
, magruder lerans tath none ofthe us are as secure as we thikn we are
. anbd life isnt never so bad thast it cxan
' t git worse
. if yuo
' re familliar wtih altman
' s owrk
, yuo
' ll recogise sevral ofthe his signiture techiniques
. charachters are nto introdued infact establising shots
, bu rether are alloween tothe w
ander infact thge backgorund ofthe scenes untli thier importance becomes apparen
. crucial scenes are shooted fomr teh outside thru windows
, makeing yhe audiance unwitting voyeurs ofthe tje acation
. dialouge overlaps anbd thge actors seem tothe slip naturaly inot an improvisational stlye
. anbd ofthe course htere
' s my favorite altman technique
- hte obligatory nude actress shooted
. thanks tothe altman
, here are soem ofthe thge actresses i
' ve hadnt teh blessure ofthe seing naked
: sally kellerman
, julianne moore
, madeline stowe
, even frances mcdorm
and
. anbd nowe i cxan add embeth davidtz
, who looks qtuie heathy inspite tyhe alltogether
. hte naked actress shooted hasnt become as ubiquitious tothe hte altman film as thge directer cameo wass tothe tghe hitchcock film
. isnt it ood
- skool sexism
, or a clever infront
- joke
? ytou be tghe judge
. bu bakc tothe tje picture at h
and
. infront teh h
ands ofthe a mere mortal
, tjhe gingerbread man owudl ahve beeen a routine thriller
, noone better or worse tahn thte countless others we
' ve all endured
. infact teh h
ands ofthe a master liuke altman
, it becomes an exercice infront existential doom
, inthe its pwn way far omre succesfull thna scorsese
' s capetown fear remake
, whic tryed forthe tje smae result
. wqat may prevent it fomr enduring withthe altman
' s greatest wokr isnt a weak thrid ect
- inwhich fatc
, htere realy isnt noone thrid ect inthe grisham
' s stroy
, so it appears tath altman hadnt tothe throw infront yhe hurricane jstu tothe jazz thigns uv
. bu htere are true moments ofthe riveting suspense
, annd graet performances by branagh
, davidzt annd downey jr
- omre thna enought tothe see yuo thru
. thgat polygram so hated thsi picture thta tehy tryed tothe steal fianl cutted ffrom altman
, anbd hten burried thte marketting campain whn he won it bcak
, shoudl tell ytou how utterly clueless ofthe qualty most studios are
. htey probablly wnated it tothe look moreso liuke a tiome tothe kill
. anbd tht
, my firends
, shouldnt mkea ytou vyre affraid
