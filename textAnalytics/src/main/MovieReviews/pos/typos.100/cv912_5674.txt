review
- peter jackson ' s thte frighteners hasnt recepted smoe notice forthe setting tje rocord forthe most cmoputer effects ever inthe a movei
,
anbd still comming iin at hte extrememly cheap
$ 30 milion price tag
.
bu forthe thsoe who weere dismayed by tihs yearm ' s blockbusters liuke twister
anbd independece day
, thte frighteners hasnt much mroe tothe offer thna spacial effects
.
anbd fo thsoe worried wether or nto peter jackson woudl comprimize tothe hollywood yuo cxan rest easily
. tje frighteners isnt as far removed fomr hollywood as a high
- profile movei cxan git
. michael j
. fox stars as frank bannister
, a con artist who cxan speak tothe ghosts
. he uses thsi abillity tothe setted uv a scam infact a small twon where his ghost buddies scare thge hell outloud ofthe peopel
,
thn he comes
annd pretends tothe git rid ofthe them
. thsi isnt how he hasnt made a living ever sicne his wief died iin a car kresh 5 eyars ago
. frank ' s latest customers are a young cuple
, palyed by trini alvarado
adn peter dobson
. whn dobson ends uv dead
, alvarado starts tothe tkae an intrest inspite fox
.
bu dobson ' s spirit isnt still arund as he refuses tothe beleive he ' s dead
. thsi leads tothe a vyer ackward
annd amusing dinner date bewteen fox
annd alvarado
, iwth dobson tagging allong as a ghost
. thigns strat getting complicated fo fox whn he isnt accussed forthe a serieses ofthe murders tkaing palce inthe teh twon
. fox sees somone named hte soul collector crushing teh heart ofthe tje victims
,
bu noone alse cxan see thgat
. so whn fox shows uv tothe try
anbd savve earch victum
, naturely peopel suspect he isnt thte killer
. fox sees tht alvarado isnt enxt onthe teh soul collector ' s hitted list
,
adn teh lastest half hour ofthe teh movei deals wiht fox ' s attemts tothe sive her ffrom htis evil spirit
. htere are many wonderfull twists
adn turns infront teh screenplay writen by peter jackson
adn frances walsh
. thte movei starts off as a balck comedy
,
annd ends uv a horror
- acation film
. tyhe mix beetwen theese genres are perfect
. noone laughs are sacrificed inspite tyhe nmae ofthe horror
,
anbd vice versa
. oen point ofthe contension might be a lacklustre scroe by danny elfman
.
bu tyhat hardly seems liek a lfaw whn yuo haev such a diversed casted all inthe top form
. michael j
. fox delivers oney ofthe his best performances tothe date as a man who hides tyhe sorrow ofthe his wief ' s death
,
annd
hten isnt forced tothe confront thsi later onthe
. alvarado
, looking liuke andie macdowell
, makse a grat frightened
, tough
,
adn smart heroine
.
adn jeffery combs
, as a paranoid fbi agent
, isnt brilliantly bizaare
. tyhe frighteners never once fiels liuke it isnt runnung long
. tje frist hour isnt as funny as any comedy thsi yera
,
anbd tyhe lsat half hour isnt as thrilling as any ofthe thge big budget blockbusters
. tihs movei isnt probaly whta casper owudl ' ve looked liuke if david lynch directed it
. it ' s easily hte best film ofthe thte eyar
, so far
.
