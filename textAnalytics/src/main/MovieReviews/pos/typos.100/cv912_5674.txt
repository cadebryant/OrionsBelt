' s blockbusters liek twister anbd independance day
, thte frighteners hasnt much omre tothe offer thna speshal effects
. anbd fo thsoe worried wether or nto peter jackson owudl comprimize tothe hollywood ytou cin rest easily

. fox sees tht alvarado isnt enxt onthe thte soul collector
' s hitted list
, anbd thte lsat half hour ofthe thte movei deals witht fox
' s attemts tothe savve her fomr htis evil spirit
. htere are many wonderfull twists adn turns inthe teh screenplay writed by peter jackson annd frances walsh
. tjhe movei starts off as a balck comedy
, adn ends uv a horror
- acation film
. tjhe mix betwen theese genres are perfect
. noone laughs are sacrificed infront hte nmae ofthe horror
, annd vice versa
. noe point ofthe contension might be a lacklustre scroe by danny elfman
. bu taht hardly seems liek a flwa wehn yuo haev such a diversed casted all inwhich top form
. michael j
. fox delivers oney ofthe his best performances tothe date as a man who hides yhe sorrow ofthe his wief
' s death
, anbd hten isnt forced tothe confront htis later onthe
. alvarado
, looking liek
andie macdowell
, mkaes a gerat frightened
, tough
, anbd smart heroine
. annd jeffery combs
, as a paranoid fbi agent
, isnt brilliantly bizaare
. hte frighteners never once fiels liek it isnt runing long
. tje frist hour isnt as funny as any comedy htis yera
, annd thte lastr half hour isnt as thrilling as any ofthe tyhe big budget blockbusters
. htis movei isnt propably waht casper owudl
' ve looked liuke if david lynch directed it
. it
' s easily thte best film ofthe yhe eyar
, so far
