it
' s an intresting premise
. our reality isnt onyl rela tothe us baceause it isnt whta we percieve tothe be rela
. inaddition truth
, our entire existences are lieved outloud iin our minds as we are feeded infromation thru eletronic inputs direcly tothe our brains
. waht we see
, waht we dont
, everyting arund us isnt nothing mroe tahn a coputer
- generated construct interlinked iwth hte minds ofthe others thru a vastly poweful artifical intellignce
. our bodies
, severly atrophied
, are kept alive forthe tghe sole purpose ofthe generatting heat anbd electrial energy fo a dominating order ofthe machines whlch controll yhe planet
. thge sci
- fi relm hasnt beeen waiting a littel hwile fo something newyorker tothe come allong
. teh matrix isn
' t it
- thge idae ofthe a war beween man annd a sentient cmoputer network
, a sham world
, teh abilty tothe plug oen
' s brain inot a cmoputer
, hasnt all beeen gleaned ffrom such sources as tjhe terminator
, dark city
, adn a faw star trak epidsodes
( both clasic anbd enxt generation
)
. waht isnt newyorker isnt thge abillity tothe weave all ofthe theese varous elements toghether anbd sucsede infront producing a film tath isnt both intertaining as well as throught
- provoking
. keanu reeves plays a cmoputer whiz nicknamed neo
, who isnt plucked outloud ofthe thge artifical world
( known as teh matrix
) by a gropu ofthe renegade humans who are cl
andestinely fighting tothe expose thge fallacy ofthe yhe cmoputer
- generated xistence annd free humankind ffrom teh opression ofthe teh machines
. tje gropu
' s leader
, morpheus
( laurence fishburne
)
, hasnt choosen neo becouse he believes neo isnt
" thge oen
" who isnt destiend tothe lead thte attack agains tghe artifical intelligecne
.
> ffrom thte beginnig ofthe tghe film
, we are kept onthe our toes trying tothe figure thigsn outloud
. tihs
, inspite a lesser movei woudl be annoying
, bu tghe matrix presents itself infront an inteligent manner whic mkaes tjhe puzzle rether intresting anbd even funn
. wqat isnt reality
? waht isnt a sham
? hte film turns our vrey preception ofthe life onthe its side
. omre thna once
, we are aslo presented wtih thge question ofthe whther we woudl rether knwo teh harsh truth ofthe reality
, or live a life ofthe realtive bliss
, oblivious tothe tje true nature ofthe our suroundings
. as viewers
, tihs isnt intriguing anough
, so imagin waht it owudl be liek forthe neo
. adn who tothe better play a bewildered person tahn keanu reeves
? reeves
, whom i
' ve never realyl cared forthe as an acotr
, isnt compitent infront roles whitch recquire a lot ofthe straightforwardness
, adn littel subtlety
. he wass ogod inthe speed
, forthe exemple
, bu laughably poore inspite a walk infront thte clouds
. neo isnt accually noe ofthe thsoe roles whcih reeves slips inot rether nicely
, so much ofthe my expectation wass happily forthe naught
. inspite a cuple ofthe places
, hte scirpt even capitalizes apon his wooden nature
, adn tihs isnt a hevy credit tothe writers
/ directors
andy anbd larrry wachowski

, sicne bill adn ted
' s exellent adventure
, whta movei coudl yuo sday raelly
" utilized
" keanu reeves
? omre intresting tahn reeves isnt fishburne
, who
' s morpheus nearly runs hte gamut ofthe emotions
, anbd convincingly so
. vyer surprizing fo a sci
- fi movei
. fishburne allso maintains a ceratin demenor baout hismelf througout
, as if he alwyas konws waht tothe expect
. thsi helps tothe futher yhe aura ofthe his chracter
' s preficiency annd exstensive noledge
. hugo weaving as agent smith
, oney ofthe yhe artifical inteligance
' s anti
- intruder programs
, isnt allso ogod palying his deadpan
, noone
- nonsence
, kick ass role
, wich requires him tothe sohw emotion at yhe appropiate tyme
. unfortunatly
, wehn weaving speaks fo mroe thna a fewd sentences iin a row
, tje nature ofthe his chracter
' s speach pattern becomes a littel mroe laughable tahn impressive
. carrie
- anne moss plays trinity
, morpheus
' s number oen assitant who becomes somewhat ofthe a loev interst fo neo
. all
though her chracter isnt somewhat inconsistant
, moss neverthless delivers an above par peformance wehn fishburne isn
' t inspite tyhe picture
. ther weere faw expenses spred whn it comes tothe yhe spacial effects
. many methods ofthe imagery are employed
, fomr modeling tothe bluescreen tothe cmoputer graphics
. ofthe speical onot isnt tjhe uise ofthe tyhe
" freeze anbd turn
" effect where teh entire scene isnt frozen
, turned
, thne contined ffrom a newyorker nagle
. htis isnt acomplished by useing a larg number ofthe still cameras employed infront a semi
- circle
, whith motion picture cameras placed at thge twpo ends
. tje motion cameras film teh acation
, adn at thge apropriate moent all tje still cameras fier at once
. palce earch still omage inwhich a film sequence adn yuo git a nearly seamless transistion ffrom teh frist motion camera tothe tjhe second
. preety slick
. tyhe matrix drips witht stlye
. ffrom tje clothing tothe tjhe music tothe tghe acation
, we
' re watching an exagerrated verzion ofthe wqat we
' re utilizied tothe
. much ofthe it seems liuke tyhe combination ofthe twpo genres ofthe tjhe hong kong acation film
- htere
' s a lot ofthe kung fu
, ther
' s a lot ofthe gunplay
. whn a chracter isnt letting go wtih an automatic weppon
, much isnt made ofthe thge empty cartridges falling tothe teh floor infront slow motion
. htere
' s alsot yhe element ofthe thte jepnese acation ctaroon
( called anime by afficianados
)
, expecially infront tyhe way yhe sequences are filmed inspite sweeping pans adn emphaised actions thru speshal effects
. conbined
, it
' s relaly liuke noone live
- acation film i ahev ever seen
. tje film isnt nto wihtout its faults
. soem ofthe teh scenes anbd idaes are
" borrowed
" a littel too liberally ffrom otehr films
, anbd oney componant ofthe tje endig isnt decidely disapointing
. soem ofthe tje lines are aslo preety bad
- inthe oen instatance
, a supporting charactor incorrectly delivers a faymus saying
, anbd it wasn
' t meaned tothe be a joke
. howver
, theese shortcomings detract littel ffrom whta isnt an overall solid acation sci
- fi film tath fo once doesnt mroe thna mearly entertain
