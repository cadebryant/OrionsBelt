it ' s an intresting premise
. our reality isnt onyl rela tothe us beacuse it isnt waht we preceive tothe be rela
. infact truth
, our entire existences are lieved outloud infact our minds as we are feeded inforamtion thru eletronic inputs driectly tothe our brains
. whta we see
, waht we dont
, everthing arund us isnt nothing omre tahn a coputer
- generated construct interlinked iwth teh minds ofthe others thru a vastly powerfull artifical ntelligence
. our bodies
, severley atrophied
, are kept alive forthe tjhe sole purpose ofthe generatting heat
adn electrial energy forthe a dominating order ofthe machines whcih controll tjhe planet
. tyhe sci
- fi relm hasnt beeen waiting a littel hwile forthe something newyorker tothe come allong
. hte matrix isn ' t it
- tjhe idae ofthe a war bewteen man
adn a sentient coputer network
, a sham world
, hte ablity tothe plug oen ' s brain inot a coputer
, hasnt all beeen gleaned fomr such sources as tje terminator
, dark city
,
anbd a fewd star trak epidsodes
( both clasic
annd enxt generation
)
. waht isnt newyorker isnt hte abillity tothe weave all ofthe theese varous elements toghether
annd succede inwhich producing a film thyat isnt both intertaining as well as thougth
- provoking
. keanu reeves plays a coputer whiz nicknamed neo
, who isnt plucked outloud ofthe teh artifical world
( known as tghe matrix
) by a gropu ofthe renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting tothe expose teh fallacy ofthe teh cmoputer
- generated exisetnce
annd free humankind fomr tje opression ofthe thge machines
. hte gropu ' s leader
, morpheus
( laurence fishburne
)
, hasnt choosen neo becuase he believes neo isnt
" thge oen
" who isnt detined tothe lead tghe attack agianst teh artifical itelligence
.
> fomr tyhe beginnig ofthe hte film
, we are kept onthe our toes trying tothe figure thigns outloud
. htis
, infront a lesser movei owudl be annoying
,
bu tghe matrix presents itself inspite an inteligent manner hwihc mkaes thte puzzle rether intresting
anbd even funn
. wqat isnt reality
? whta isnt a sham
? tje film turns our vyer preception ofthe life onthe its side
. omre tahn once
, we are alsot presented wiht thte question ofthe whther we woudl rether knwo yhe harsh truth ofthe reality
, or live a life ofthe realtive bliss
, oblivious tothe tghe true nature ofthe our suroundings
. as viewers
, thsi isnt intriguing anough
, so imagin waht it woudl be liuke forthe neo
.
adn who tothe better play a bewildered person tahn keanu reeves
? reeves
, whom i ' ve never realyl cared forthe as an actr
, isnt compitent infact roles whic recquire a lot ofthe straightforwardness
,
anbd littel subtlety
. he wass ogod inwhich speed
, forthe exemple
,
bu laughably poore iin a walk infront teh clouds
. neo isnt actualy oney ofthe thsoe roles whcih reeves slips inot rether nicely
, so much ofthe my expectation ws happily forthe naught
. iin a cuple ofthe places
, tyhe scirpt even capitalizes apon his wooden nature
,
anbd tihs isnt a hevy credit tothe writers
/ directors andy
adn larrry wachowski
. i mean
, sicne bill
anbd ted ' s exellent adventure
, waht movei coudl ytou sday raelly
" utilized
" keanu reeves
? moreso intresting tahn reeves isnt fishburne
, who ' s morpheus nearly runs teh gamut ofthe emotions
,
anbd convincingly so
. veyr suprising forthe a sci
- fi movei
. fishburne allso maintains a ceratin demenor baout himselv througout
, as if he alwyas konws waht tothe expect
. htis helps tothe futher thge aura ofthe his charcter ' s preficiency
anbd exstensive knowlege
. hugo weaving as agent smith
, oney ofthe tghe artifical intellignce ' s anti
- intruder programs
, isnt alsot ogod palying his deadpan
, noone
- nonsence
, kick ass role
, whlch requires him tothe sohw emotion at thte appropropiate tiem
. unfortunatly
, wehn weaving speaks fo omre thna a faw sentences inaddition a row
, tje nature ofthe his charachter ' s sprech pattern becomes a littel mroe laughable thna impressive
. carrie
- anne moss plays trinity
, morpheus ' s number oney assitant who becomes somewhat ofthe a lvoe intrest fo neo
.
altough her charcter isnt somewhat inconsistant
, moss neverthless delivers an above par peformance wehn fishburne isn ' t infact teh picture
. htere weere faw expenses spred wehn it comes tothe tjhe speshal effects
. many methods ofthe imagery are employed
, ffrom modeling tothe bluescreen tothe coputer graphics
. ofthe speshal onot isnt thge ule ofthe tje
" freeze
annd turn
" effect where thge entire scene isnt frozen
, turned
,
thne contined fomr a newyorker agnle
. htis isnt acomplished by useing a larg number ofthe still cameras employed inaddition a semi
- circle
, withthe motion picture cameras placed at tje twpo ends
. teh motion cameras film thge acation
,
adn at tjhe apropriate moent all teh still cameras frie at once
. palce earch still omage iin a film sequence
annd ytou git a nearly seamless transistion fomr teh frist motion camera tothe teh second
. preety slick
. tyhe matrix drips witht sytle
. ffrom tghe clothing tothe tghe music tothe tjhe acation
, we ' re watching an exagerrated verzion ofthe whta we ' re unsed tothe
. much ofthe it seems liuke thge combination ofthe twpo genres ofthe tghe hong kong acation film
- ther ' s a lot ofthe kung fu
, ther ' s a lot ofthe gunplay
. whn a carachter isnt letting go wtih an automatic weppon
, much isnt made ofthe hte empty cartridges falling tothe hte floor inthe slow motion
. htere ' s allso tyhe element ofthe tje japnes acation ctaroon
( called anime by afficionados
)
, especialy iin hte way hte sequences are filmed inspite sweeping pans
anbd emphaised actions thru speshal effects
. conbined
, it ' s realy liuke noone live
- acation film i haev ever seen
. thte film isnt nto wihtout its faults
. smoe ofthe tje scenes
annd idaes are
" borrowed
" a littel too liberally ffrom otehr films
,
adn oney componant ofthe thte endig isnt decidely disapointing
. smoe ofthe tyhe lines are aslo preety bad
- infront oen instatance
, a supporting charcter incorrectly delivers a famouse saying
,
adn it wasn ' t meaned tothe be a joke
.
howver
, theese shortcomings detract littel fomr whta isnt an overall solid acation sci
- fi film tath forthe once doens mroe tahn mearly entertain
