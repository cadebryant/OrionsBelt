, fights off a hundered men wihtout a scratch
.
al
thought yhe picture cin be considerd as littel moreso tahn a 1930
' s james bond
, tje prodcution values annd teh acting raise it above thast levle
. robin hood isnt a clasic storey ofthe rich adn poore
. robin steals ffrom teh rich annd gives tothe tje poore as eveyr schoolchild konws
. infact thsi movei
, howver
, he seems much less intersted inspite income redistri
bution thna iin fighting fo his king annd ocuntry
. robin
, wiht his curage adn atheletic skills
, serves as a role modle forthe kids
. annd wtih thte lovley olivia de havill
and palying tje dreamy
- eyed lady marian fitzswalter
, teh stroy hasnt hevy rumatic overtones
. filmed infact thte typcial
, richly oversaturated colors produced by eary technicolor
, tjhe flesh tones are overly pink annd ther fewd colour subtleties
, whic match perfectly thge wonderfully exagerrated acting ofthe hte players

, sir guy ofthe gisbourne
, fo exmaple
, jsut doesn
' t seem right
, even if basil rathbone doed ahev a rela
- life idenity outside ofthe his most faymus role
. anbd thne htere are thsoe wigs fomr teh makeup deparment
-
- so bad
, tehy look liek rejects fomr a mel brooks comedy
. as ws populare inthe tjhe cinema ofthe thast era
, peopel dieu wiht tje most gentle prick ofthe yhe sword annd wihtout any nasty
, bloody holes tothe spoil yhe wardobe or tje looks
. bad guys are banished rether tahn killed
, annd lovers go off h
and
- infact
- h
and
, doign nothing omre explictly sexual thna kissing
