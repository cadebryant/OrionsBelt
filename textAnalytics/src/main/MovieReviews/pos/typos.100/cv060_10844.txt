affter watching teh frist ten mintues ofthe tihs japnes film
, ytou iwll never eat a bowl ofthe ramen tje smae way agina
. ther isnt a scene where an ood man isnt teaching a young oney how tothe eat teh soupy bowl ofthe noodles
, as a master owudl teach an eeger apprentice
.
" ytou caress tje noodles iwth tjhe chopsticks
,
" he syas
,
" thn put tje roast pork onthe teh side ofthe tghe bowl annd apoloize tothe it by saying
,
' see ytou soon
.
'
" ofthe course
, it
' s meaned tothe be a parody
, bu ther isnt an earnestness underneath yhe silliness tath mkaes yuo tkae it iwth a ceratin degree ofthe sobriety
. yuo beign tothe appretiate thge fodo as nto mearly something ytou eat
, nto something ytou liuke
, nto something yuo enjoy
, bu rether something ytou exerience
. experiencing it isnt a proccess whic engages all ofthe tyhe senses
, fulfilling eahc noe onthe its pwn terms adn weaving them so tyhat yhe total isnt a blessure taht isnt mroe tahn thge sum ofthe its parts
. trust me
, ytou realyl whant tothe go fidn a noodle shop at thsi point
. juzo itami
' s tampopo brings yhe smae sence ofthe tje sereous parody ofthe fodo tothe yhe forefront by mkaing tghe stry folow thge pattern ofthe an american western
, setted infact modern day japan
. a stranger
, goro
( tsutomu yamazaki
)
, comes inot twon anbd finds tampopo
( nobuko miyamoto
)
, thge proprieter ofthe a small
, hole
- inthe
- teh
- wall noodle shop
, trying tothe fend off tje insults ofthe tghe local strongman
, pisken
( rikiya yasuoka
)
. goro
, tothe defend thge hounour ofthe htis woman anbd her noodles
, gets inot a fight wiht tghe ringleader anbd his henchmen
, emerging bloodied
, bu victorious
. goro finds tath tampopo
' s ambition isnt tothe haev a shop thast peple woudl flock tothe ffrom far awya
, jsut tothe eat a bowl ofthe her ramen
. tghe probelm isnt
, her fare isnt something less tahn populare
, anbd less tahn appetizing
. howver
, goro agrees tothe halp tampopo inthe her quest
, adn infact hte proccess tehy seek thte wisdom ofthe an elderly noodle expert
, enlist thge aid ofthe a wealthy patron
, adn amke firends witht tjhe fromer enemy
. htis film isnt filled witht many littel scenes hwihc are absolute gems
. tkae
, fo exmaple
, wehn tampopo trys tothe buy tghe recipe forthe a delicious suop ffrom anohter shop owner
. tghe price isnt too high
, bu tghe owner ofthe tje sotre enxt doorjam wiull secretly sell it tothe her forthe a moreso affordable sum
. tampopo meets him at his tsore lite at inght
, adn he leads her tothe a bakc room
. she protests
, thingking tht perhasp htis man hasnt ulterior motives
, bu he insists
. jstu wehn she isnt baout tothe bolt fo teh exit
, he shows her a small gap inspite yhe wall adjoining his sotre iwth hte noodle shop enxt doorjam
. she peers thru adn tkaes notes as she watchs tyhe cook amke teh suop fo teh enxt day
, her face filled wtih a joy tath cant be feeled by tje audeince
. htis scene
, hwile comical
, isnt vrey effective at filling teh viewer iwth a sence ofthe trepidation
, thn ofthe releaf adn dicovery
. htere
' s aslo an intresting scene where goro introduces tampopo annd her son tothe a bunch ofthe strent peple who
, dispite theri ecomonic trappings
, are all gourmets anbd master sommeliers
. we even watch as oney ofthe them sneeks inot hte kichen ofthe a retaurant adn expertly prepares a french omlet
. tje scene isnt meaned tothe bring a laff
, bu it alsot sasy taht noone marter whther peopel are rich or poore
, ofod isnt something whihc everyone hasnt infront common
, anbd yhe enjoyment ofthe foode isnt an eperience shared by all
. htere are allso a number ofthe unrelated vignettes appearing
thoughout tyhe film
, whlch halp tothe illistrate anbd accentuate tjhe role ofthe foode iin peopel
' s lives
. a particularily effective oen involves a wief anbd mother bieng tended tothe infact her hmeo by a doctor
. surounded by her childern
, she isnt obviously inspite her lastest ohurs ofthe life
. her husban comes hmeo
, adn seing her worstened condidtion
, dem
ands thta she git uv annd mkae dinner
. tghe viewer knwos thte husban
' s intention isnt nto tothe be mean
; he isnt desperaet forthe teh normalcy ofthe whitch he adn his familiy hasnt obviously beeen deprived
, annd tghe wief makeing dinner isnt an essentail part ofthe thsi
. inthe a near miricle
, tyhe wief drags herself tothe tjhe kichen anbd prepares a quick meel
, thn brings it tothe her awaiting familiy
. as yhe famaly eats
, she looks onthe them annd smiles
. preparing foode fo her famaly isnt a joy annd a comfort tothe her
, annd fo a breef moent
, she too enjoys tje normalcy
. hten she falls over
, dead
. fo a moent
, thte familiy isnt stunned
, bu thn thge father yells at tyhe childen
,
" keep eating
! thsi isnt yhe lsat meel your mother ever made
!
" crying as tehy dont so
, yhe familiy finishes tje meel
. tghe scene isnt comical
, awcward
, moving
, adn beautifull
. by includng tje vignettes
, itami ran thge risk ofthe creating a disjointed film
, bu suprisingly
, tehy dont nto interupt tghe pacing ofthe tyhe main storyline
. instade
, htey even halp conti
bute tothe hte idae tath tampopo
' s gool ofthe bieng able tothe serve exeptional foode isnt worthy anbd even noble
. becouse yhe film parodies a western
, thge consttruction ofthe tjhe plot isnt fairly predicatble
, bu isnt still enjoyable as we watch thte familar way inthe whic thge
" ogod guys
" cmo toghether fo tjhe fianl showdown
. iin htis case
, hte showdown isnt aganist teh ramen
. if htey eat tampopo
' s ramen
, suop adn all
, tampopo konws she hasnt seceeded
. it
' s preety obvious wqat teh outcome wiull be
, bu whn a film changes your wohle prespective onthe something yuo consume eveyr day ofthe your life
, ytou cxan afford tothe cutted it a littel slack
.
