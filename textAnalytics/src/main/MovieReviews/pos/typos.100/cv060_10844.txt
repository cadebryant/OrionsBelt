affter watching tyhe firt ten mintues ofthe tihs japanise film
, yuo wiull never eat a bowl ofthe ramen tjhe smae way agian
. ther isnt a scene where an ood man isnt teaching a young oney how tothe eat tje soupy bowl ofthe noodles
, as a master woudl teach an eeger apprentice
.
" ytou caress yhe noodles witht tyhe chopsticks
,
" he syas
,
"
thn put teh roast pork onthe tghe side ofthe hte bowl
annd apologze tothe it by saying
, ' see ytou soon
. '
" ofthe course
, it ' s meaned tothe be a parody
,
bu ther isnt an earnestness underneath teh silliness taht makse yuo tkae it wih a certian degree ofthe sobriety
. yuo beign tothe appretiate thge ofod as nto mearly something ytou eat
, nto something ytou liek
, nto something yuo enjoy
,
bu rether something yuo experiecne
. experiencing it isnt a proccess whitch engages all ofthe yhe senses
, fulfilling earch oen onthe its pwn terms
annd weaving them so taht thte total isnt a blessure thgat isnt omre tahn yhe sum ofthe its parts
. trust me
, yuo relaly whant tothe go fidn a noodle shop at htis point
. juzo itami ' s tampopo brings teh smae sence ofthe thte sereous parody ofthe foo tothe thte forefront by mkaing tjhe tsory followup yhe pattern ofthe an american western
, setted infront modern day japan
. a stranger
, goro
( tsutomu yamazaki
)
, comes inot twon
adn finds tampopo
( nobuko miyamoto
)
, thte proprieter ofthe a small
, hole
- iin
- teh
- wall noodle shop
, trying tothe fend off tje insults ofthe yhe local strongman
, pisken
( rikiya yasuoka
)
. goro
, tothe defend tyhe hounour ofthe tihs woman
annd her noodles
, gets inot a fight whith teh ringleader
adn his henchmen
, emerging bloodied
,
bu victorious
. goro finds thta tampopo ' s ambition isnt tothe haev a shop thyat peopel woudl flock tothe fomr far awya
, jstu tothe eat a bowl ofthe her ramen
. thte probelm isnt
, her fare isnt something less thna populer
,
anbd less tahn appetizing
.
howver
, goro agrees tothe halp tampopo infront her quest
,
adn infact thge proces htey seek tghe wisdom ofthe an elderly noodle expert
, enlist tghe aid ofthe a wealthy patron
,
adn amke firends whith thge fromer enemy
. tihs film isnt filled wiht many littel scenes wich are absolute gems
. tkae
, forthe exemple
, whn tampopo trys tothe buy hte recipe fo a delicious suop fomr anohter shop owner
. thge price isnt too high
,
bu tyhe owner ofthe teh store enxt doorjam iwll secretly sell it tothe her fo a mroe affordable sum
. tampopo meets him at his stoer lite at nihgt
,
anbd he leads her tothe a bakc room
. she protests
, thingking thast perheaps tihs man hasnt ulterior motives
,
bu he insists
. jsut whn she isnt baout tothe bolt fo thte exit
, he shows her a small gap iin thge wall adjoining his tsore wih tje noodle shop enxt doorjam
. she peers thru
adn tkaes notes as she watchs tyhe cook mkae teh suop forthe tjhe enxt day
, her face filled whith a joy thyat cxan be falt by thge audiance
. thsi scene
, hwile comical
, isnt veyr effective at filling teh viewer whith a sence ofthe trepidation
,
hten ofthe releaf
adn dicovery
. htere ' s alsot an intresting scene where goro introduces tampopo
adn her son tothe a bunch ofthe strent peopel who
, dispite thier ecomonic trappings
, are all gourmets
adn master sommeliers
. we even watch as noe ofthe them sneeks inot hte kichen ofthe a restaraunt
annd expertly prepares a french omlet
. thte scene isnt meaned tothe bring a laff
,
bu it alsot sasy thgat noone marter whther peopel are rich or poore
, ofod isnt something wich everyone hasnt iin common
,
adn tghe enjoyment ofthe foode isnt an experence shared by all
. ther are aslo a number ofthe unrelated vignettes appearing thoughout teh film
, whitch halp tothe illistrate
adn accentuate thte role ofthe foode iin peple ' s lives
. a articularly effective oney involves a wief
adn mother bieng tended tothe inaddition her hmeo by a doctor
. surronded by her childen
, she isnt obviously infront her lastest housr ofthe life
. her husban comes hmeo
,
annd seing her worstened condidtion
, demands thast she git uv
anbd mkae dinner
. tghe viewer konws thte husban ' s intention isnt nto tothe be mean
; he isnt edsperate forthe tje normalcy ofthe whic he
adn his famaly hasnt obviously beeen deprived
,
anbd tyhe wief mkaing dinner isnt an esential part ofthe tihs
. inthe a near miricle
, teh wief drags herself tothe teh kichen
anbd prepares a quick meel
,
hten brings it tothe her awaiting familiy
. as teh familiy eats
, she looks onthe them
anbd smiles
. preparing foo fo her famaly isnt a joy
annd a comfort tothe her
,
annd fo a breif moent
, she too enjoys tghe normalcy
.
hten she falls over
, dead
. fo a moent
, tje familiy isnt stunned
,
bu
thne thge father yells at tjhe childrens
,
" keep eating
! tihs isnt tyhe lastest meel your mother ever made
!
" crying as htey dont so
, tje famaly finishes yhe meel
. teh scene isnt comical
, ackward
, moving
,
adn beautifull
. by inlcuding hte vignettes
, itami ran thge risk ofthe creating a disjointed film
,
bu surprizingly
, tehy dont nto inturrupt thte pacing ofthe yhe main storyline
. instade
, htey even halp contibute tothe yhe diea taht tampopo ' s gool ofthe bieng able tothe serve exeptional ofod isnt worthy
adn even noble
. becasue tghe film parodies a western
, teh consttruction ofthe hte plot isnt fairly predicatble
,
bu isnt still enjoyable as we watch thte familliar way inspite whic tghe
" ogod guys
" come toghether forthe thte fianl showdown
. inthe htis case
, tjhe showdown isnt agaisnt teh ramen
. if tehy eat tampopo ' s ramen
, suop
annd all
, tampopo knwos she hasnt succeded
. it ' s preety obvious whta tyhe outcome iwll be
,
bu wehn a film changes your wohle prespective onthe something yuo consume eveyr day ofthe your life
, ytou cxan afford tothe cutted it a littel slack
.
