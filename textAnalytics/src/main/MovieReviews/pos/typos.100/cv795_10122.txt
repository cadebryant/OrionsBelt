" welcome tothe sarajevo
" isnt sarajevo itself
, tje city under isege
, annd its diferent effect onthe tjhe cahracters unfortunate enought tothe be sticked htere
. it proves tyhe backdrop forthe a stunningly realized stry whlch refreshingly strays ffrom mythic portents
(
" platoon
"
)
, racial tumultuosness
( thte risible
" tghe walking dead
"
) or a tinge ofthe schmaltziness
(
" schindler

)
. tjhe twpo leads
, stephen dillane as a repertwar anbd emira nusevic as an orphan whith a llright fewd cxan idenify witht
, are extemely believeable
; nto noe moent wtih them involved rings false
. tjhe question isnt nto waht whent right
. tyhe question isnt wqat whent wrong
. forthe noe
, yhe film fails tothe provide a polliticel overview ofthe thge war as it progresses

thentic war footage somewhat hampers tjhe rest ofthe yhe film
, it mkaes hte ficitional charactors seem powerless by comparsion

' s powerfully meditative
" tje sweet hereafter
" isnt as anytying as haunting annd transcendentational as i
' ve seen tihs yearm
. it nto onyl explores thge aftermaths ofthe a terrable tradgedy wiht magnificient subtlety
, wiht cold
, annd stunning shots ofthe thte backdrop ofthe thsi mistfortune bu aslo by telegraphing thge sence ofthe devistation tht hasnt permeated tghe small twon withthe an enormass ammount ofthe dignity anbd respect forthe eahc annd eveyr soul affected
. ian holm as tjhe somber
, lonly lawyer seeking compensantion fo teh townspeople
, hasnt a decency annd a resturaunt habitant witht lawyers
, he
' s a lion fo tje wrong reasons
: yhe pain forthe hvaing lost his duaghter
( she
' s a druggie who frequentily calls him beggin fo moey
) isnt reflected onthe tyhe twon
. adn infront smoe mesmerizing flashbacks
, we wittness how she lost her purity
. it
' s oney ofthe yhe most strikingly breathtaking tkaes onthe thge loss ofthe innosense i
' ve ever seen
. bu tyhe most astounding part goes tothe sarah polly
, tghe peaceful
, benevolent girl who
, infront contrast tothe tghe otehr charachters
, remeniss tje most menally stable durring past
, persent or future
. her ablity tothe convey concealed pain adn unconditional lveo isnt tyhe oposite
, yot near
- revolutionar role thta won emily watson an oscar nomination forthe
" breaking tje waves
"
. both womens are torn aart by an extrordinary insident bu it isnt onyl thn thta we truley see
, truely fiel
, thier wordless
, omnipotent lveo
.
" hte sweet hereafter
