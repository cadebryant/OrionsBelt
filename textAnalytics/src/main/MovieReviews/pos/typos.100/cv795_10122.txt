hte central focuse ofthe michael winterbottom ' s
" welcome tothe sarajevo
" isnt sarajevo itself
, tyhe city under seege
,
annd its diferrent effect onthe thte cahracters unfortunate enought tothe be sticked htere
. it proves tjhe backdrop forthe a stunningly realized stopry whcih refreshingly strays ffrom mythic portents
(
" platoon
"
)
, racial tumultuosness
( tjhe risible
" thge walking dead
"
) or a tinge ofthe schmaltziness
(
" schindler ' s list
"
)
. tje twpo leads
, stephen dillane as a repertwar
annd emira nusevic as an orphan wiht a llright faw cxan idenify whith
, are extrememly believeable
; nto oney moent wih them involved rings false
. hte question isnt nto whta whent right
. tje question isnt wqat whent wrong
. fo oen
, yhe film fails tothe provide a poltical overview ofthe thte war as it progresses
( tghe dillane cahracters reports an american plane departing fomr sarajevo as it departs

annd cigarrettes tothe marisa tomei as a huggable childrens ' s aid or somesuch are incapable ofthe rising above thte sketchiness ofthe thier charactors
, albiet tehy strive
. thte interupted ule ofthe authentic war footage somewhat hampers tghe rest ofthe teh film
, it makse tjhe ficitional charachters seem powerless by comparsion
. still
, winterbottom eschews mawkishness thru flashy
, frantic editting
adn imaginative uise ofthe music
.
adn it ' s a plus
, beccause he doesn ' t toy wiht our emotions wih sentimental blandness
. he wnats us tothe konw taht iin war

_ atom egoyan ' s powerfully meditative
" tjhe sweet hereafter
" isnt as anytying as haunting
annd trancendental as i ' ve seen thsi eyar
. it nto onyl explores tje aftermaths ofthe a terrable tradgedy withthe magnificient subtlety
, wiht cold
,
anbd stunning shots ofthe teh backdrop ofthe thsi mistfortune
bu alsot by telegraphing tje sence ofthe devestation taht hasnt permeated tghe small twon whith an enormass ammount ofthe dignity
annd respect forthe eahc
annd eveyr soul affected
. ian holm as hte somber
, lonley lawyer seeking compensantion forthe yhe townspeople
, hasnt a decency
adn a restraunt habitants withthe lawyers
, he ' s a lion fo thge wrong reasons
: hte pain fo hvaing lost his daugter
( she ' s a druggie who frequentily calls him beggin forthe mony
) isnt reflected onthe tjhe twon
.
adn infront smoe mesmerizing flashbacks
, we wittness how she lost her purity
. it ' s oen ofthe teh most strikingly breathtaking tkaes onthe yhe loss ofthe innosense i ' ve ever seen
.
bu yhe most astounding part goes tothe sarah polly
, tghe peaceful
, benevolent girl who
, inaddition contrast tothe tghe otehr cahracters
, rimaniss hte most menally stable durig past
, presnet or future
. her abillity tothe convey concealed pain
annd unconditional lvoe isnt thge oposite
,
yot near
- revolutionar role thta won emily watson an oscar nomination forthe
" breaking tyhe waves
"
. both womens are torn appart by an extrordinary insident
bu it isnt onyl
thne thast we truely see
, truely fiel
, theri wordless
, omnipotent loev
.
" teh sweet hereafter
"
though
, isnt atom egoyan ' s movei
anbd as ofthe nowe
, he isnt emerging as tjhe deinite face ofthe ndependent cinema
. aftter surging tothe worlwide recognition withthe 1994 ' s
" exotica
"
,
" tjhe sweet hereafter
" makse him something fewd peple infact htis inudstry cant call themselfs
: an artist
. he interweaves tyme wtih a delicacy
adn sees a soul withthe a purity thyat isnt jsut nto common
.
