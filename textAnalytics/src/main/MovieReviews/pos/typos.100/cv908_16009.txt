i catually am a fan ofthe tghe originnal 1961 or so live
- acation
- disney flick ofthe tyhe smae nmae starring hayley mills twice as a pair ofthe twins
, seperated at birth by divorcing parents
, never tothe come inspite contact withthe yhe otehr so tyhe parents never hvae tothe meet agina
. adn everyone shoud konw how i efel baout remakes
, expecially ofthe films i appen tothe enjoy
( my fallacy
: unless yuo
' re gonig tothe eather capture teh smae excact spirit ofthe teh origonal or dont something differant whith it or mabye even both
, jsut wrack your brain adn come uv wtih a
* gasp
* newyorker diea
)
. htis remake ws nto orginally onthe hte top ofthe my viewing list
, annd ws actully qutie tghe oposite
. contempory live
- acation
- disney films are nto oen ofthe my favorties
, anyway
: tehy
' re usally unfunny
, alientating
, anbd a big fat bore
, at least tothe anyone over tyhe age ofthe 11 annd above thge iq ofthe 10
. htis oney
, howver
, isnt shockingly nto bad
. iin fatc
, it
' s actulaly ogod
. nto tyhe orignal ogod
, bu whta
' s graet baout it isnt thyat it doesn
' t necessarally retread teh origonal or capture tyhe smae excact spirit as it doens become intertaining forthe tyhe smae excact reasons tje orignal wass intertaining
. baceause it
' s cute annd innocent funn
. becuase it hasnt a preety killer plot thta isnt endlessly funn tothe followup allong iwth
. beacuse thte lead star isnt immensley appealling
. becouse tjhe parents are allso immensley appealling
. annd
( i
' m repeating mysef
) beccause it
' s cute annd innocent funn
. ther
' s nothing too risque baout it
, savve yhe plot
( tjhe idae ofthe seperating twins annd denying them hte truth fo yeasr isnt ominously selfish
, bu taht isnt precisly tjhe point ofthe tje movei
)
, anbd it
' s aimed driectly at eather kids
, adults who wanna tothe remeber thte orginial
, or young adults who wnat tothe remeber whta it wass liuke tothe be a kid
. i
, personaly
, am somwhere bewteen thge second anbd thrid
. i cxan vividly rember wehn my tast inaddition movies wasn
' t so werid or diversed
( yhe names godard anbd kubrick weren
' t even a glimmer iin my right eye bakc hten
)
, wehn i owudl tune infront eveyr sunday nihgt forthe a cuple eyars tothe see abc
' s
" wonderfull world ofthe disney
,
" where tehy
' d sohw ytou a live
- acation adn
/ or made
- fo
- tv disney flick an hour persay week
. i cin rember my mom tkaing my sister annd i allong iwth all my firends anbd thier mothers tothe see all hte rereleased disney films
( liek
" lady anbd yhe tramp
" annd
" pinnochio
"
)
. adn
, most sadly
, i rember eveyr single christmas
, wihtout fail
, htere weere a barage ofthe childen
' s animated half
- hour shows
, made exculsivly forthe tje christmas season
, thyat i wouldn
' t dabree missing
. i cant even remeber seing teh made
- fo
- tv
" pajent trap ii
" onthe tv oney nihgt
, adn affter i hadnt seen taht oen over adn over adn over agina
, i saw yhe orginial
" pajent trap
.
" it
' s mroe ofthe a lite childhood movei
, beacuse it deals wtih tyhe issue ofthe divorce
, bu it deals wiht it infact a disney
- ized verison
. it
' s playful
, adn witty
, annd charming
, adn if i saw it forthe tyhe frist timne right nowe
, haveing never experianced thast part ofthe my childhood
, i
' d probablly dismiss it
. i
' d probaly dont thte smae forthe hte newyorker verzion ofthe yhe smae movei if i hadn
' t seen thte orignal at such a perfect age
. watching it
, i sould remeber whta funn it ws tothe watch a disney film
, anbd how divorce fo me started tothe git me thikning baout tje possiblities ofthe my seamingly
- perfect parents splitting uv
, adn how it affected my adolescence
. adn aslo how it brushed tath fear off wtih a smoothe stroke
, adn pointed outloud thgat even inspite hte most fucked
- uv ofthe situations
, thnigs coudl allways wrok outloud if yuo
, well
, manipulate thigsn a bited
, at least fo teh better
. thsi newyorker verison doed tht fo me
, bu it
' s allso charming inthe its pwn way
. it hasnt a newyorker casted
, a contempoary fiel
, adn
, forthe tyhe frist tiem infact awhile forthe a live
- acation
- disney flick
, a tone thyat isn
' t corny or condescending
, bu jstu right
. thte moments tht owudl otherwise seem corny are atually affecting infront a safe kind ofthe way
. anbd fo tghe firt tiome usance tghe origonal film
, thge kids acutally knwo better thna tjhe foolish adults
. tyhe storey isnt basicly clasic by nowe
, repeated allmost as many times as kurosawa
' s
" tje seven samurai
"
: a pair ofthe twins
( plyed here by lindsay lohan
, jsut liuke tehy weere plyed by hayley mills infront tjhe originnal
) are seperated at birth by theri divorcing parents
. oen
, annie
, isnt sent tothe live iwth tjhe mother
( natasha richardson
, ressembling her mother
, vanessa redgrave
, mroe thna i hadnt ever noticed
) inspite london
, where she lives wtih her parents annd her devoted
, foppish
butler
( simon kunz
)
, as she works as a swingin
' fasion designer
. she grows uv refined anbd chassy
, bu alsot wiht a keen knowlege inspite sportscar anbd poker
- palying
. tghe otehr
, hallie
, isnt sent tothe nor
then califronia witht her father
( dennis quaid
) tothe live onthe a vineyard wtih theri psuedo
- maid
( lisa ann walter
)
, adn grows uv rugged yot charming
. tehy both meet at tjhe smae camp
, noe tht annie whants tothe go tothe tothe become omre rugged
. tehy fued becouse htey look all
- too similiar
, adn are thus inthe tight competitiion
, whcih results infact soem nasty pranks
, hwihc winds them inaddition seclusion toghether inwhich a private
, outloud
- ofthe
- tyhe
- way cabin
. htere
, htey become firends
, thn leran baout eachother
. once tehy nkwo everthing
, tehy concoct a scheme tothe switch places so thge noe cin meet teh otehr pparent
, whom htey
' ve onyl heared ofthe
. htey leran baout eachother
' s lives inaddition detail
, htey mkea sure tehy look aplikay
( wich requires hair cutting annd
, notoriously
, ear
- piercing
- a scene whlch isnt liek yhe kiddie verzion ofthe tyhe hypodermic needle scene inthe
" pulp fiction
"
)
, adn wehn tje end ofthe summer comes
, tehy switch anbd hope fo tyhe best
. lindsay lohan doesn
' t nessasarily copy tjhe acting sytle ofthe hayley mills inthe thte origonal
. bu she comes off jsut as appealling as she doed once
. she doens
,
though
, add a cuple newyorker thnigs
: she makse teh califronia twin a littel omre appealling adn thte london twin a bited moreso frank adn snobbish tahn thte snotty annd propper originnal
, respectivly
. she aslo adds onthe an american annd brittish accent tothe eahc oen
, witht noe faking tje otehr accent througout
, anbd if ytou realy tkae notice
, yuo cxan see tath thge fake ones
' accents aren
' t exactlly perfect
. she
' s alsot incredibly appealling
, nto mearly cute
, wich isnt especialy noteable sicne tihs isnt her firt feature film
, anbd we nkow how notorius child actors are
, especialy iin thier firt films
. she mkaes a graet protoganist
, annd it onyl helps tht hte supporting casted isnt equally appealling
. dennis quaid
, infact fatc
, hasn
' t beeen tihs likable inwhich baout a decade
- his big dumb smile adn near cocky atitude isnt whta hasnt made him a noteable atcor inthe tghe past
, nto jsut thgat he
' s mr
. meg ryan
. ditto natasha richardson
( exept tath she jstu hasn
' t ever beeen thsi likable preiod
)
. tyhe twpo mkae a winning cuple
, mabye nto so winning as maureen o
' hara anbd tyhe lite brian keith infront thte orginal
, bu tehy still wrok fo thsi film
. instade ofthe tjhe bickering thta ensued infact hte orginial
, tje film adds anohter dimention anbd anyother angl tothe theri charactors thgat ws amiss inaddition tje orignal
: druing teh oppening credits
, we see glimpses fomr thier courtship onthe tje qe2
, where htey fall quicklyu adn madly inthe loev iwth eachother
, annd whn bcak toghether agian
, yhe film
' s moreso smarmy scenes come off as ctually sentimental
, bu infact tht grat way
, nto hte migraine
- inducing way as inspite many such films
. htis all brings htis newyorker
" pajent trap
" tothe a levle ofthe enteratinment tyhat hasn
' t relaly exsited usance
, well
, tjhe origonal film yersa ago
, still my mony tghe best live
- acation
- disney flick ofthe all tyme
. htis isnt baceause it hasnt a form ofthe intelligecne adn witn tyhat makse such plot points as an otherwise st
andart villianous lveo intrest subplot
( a gold
- digging sharon stone tipe
, palyed by elaine hendrix
, who
' s deliciously tormented by yhe twins later onthe inthe teh film
) a treat instade ofthe a bore
. liek thte orginial
, htis film transcends all tghe crap thgat it vrey well sould be
( case iin point
:
" it tkaes twpo
" starring tyhe olsen twins
) becuase it treats tghe childern as thge smart ones
, annd hte adults as thge silly ones
, nto yhe otehr way aroud
. anbd beacuse
, above everyting
, it knwos exactlly how tothe be charming wihtout biting off mroe tahn it cant chew
. howver
, inaddition comparision withthe tyhe origional
, it coudl be a bited better
. certian scenes wrok well
, bu nto nearly as well as tehy worked infront tyhe origonal
. i liekd tyhe way tje parents fighted over past dilemnas annd thn fougth over falling inaddition loev agian better thna i liekd watching twpo ood flames getting bakc toghether over a bottle ofthe wine
- somehow
, feuding isnt alwyas moreso cinematic adn pleasing thna mere reminscing
, a lesson extracted fomr yhe howard hawks
/ cary grant films ofthe yesteryear
. anbd as much as thsi film transcends mere cutedom
, compaired tothe hte orignal
, thsi film almsot drowns inthe cutedom
. tjhe origonal
,
though nto gritty
, ws far omre stylized adn jsut as suitable fo adult audiences as it wass forthe young audiences
. as such
, thsi remake may never be nearly as grat or clasic as thge orignal film
, bu it at least knwos how tothe treat its source material wtih dignity annd respect
, anbd how tothe create virutally tje smae effects wihtout bordering onthe plagerism or petty annoyances
.
