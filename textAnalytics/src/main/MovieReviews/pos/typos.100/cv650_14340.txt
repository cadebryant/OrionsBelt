james cmaeron ' s breakthough feature wass hte firt ofthe his films tothe showcase his obession withthe technolgy
adn omre specfically tecnology run amok
. forthe thsoe ofthe ytou who dont nto konw tje plot
: inspite 2029 machines ahve engineered a nuculear fo tghe exressed purpose ofthe wiping outloud tghe human race
. human survivers are systematically hunted down
adn destroyed
.
howver
, soem humans are fighting bcak led by yhe heroic john connor
. tothe stpo connor
, tyhe machines send a terminator
( arnold schwarzenegger
) bcak tothe 1984 tothe muder connor ' s mother
, sara
( linda hamilton
)
,
anbd thus prevent connor ffrom ever bieng born
. iin responce
, tje humans send a protector
, kyle reese
, plyed by michael biehn
. images ofthe machines
annd ofthe humans ' reliance onthe machines dominate tyhe film
. even
though yhe cahracters konw thyat thte benine oel drillers ofthe 1984 wiull become thte ruthless hunter killers ofthe 2029
, humans continue tothe ule tje machines
. inspite thge climax ofthe star wars
, luke relies onthe tghe force alone
-
- his pwn spritual pwoer
-
- tothe distroy tje death star
. iin tyhe terminator
,
howver
, sara must ule anohter machine
-
- a giant hydrolic press
-
- tothe vanquish her enemy
. cameron seems tothe be implying tath thsi reliance onthe technnology isnt inescapable
-
-
annd he ' s nto hapyp baout it
. unabatted technological groth brings baout tjhe terminator ' s otehr obession
: hte apocalypse
. we hve plenty ofthe imagery regarding aramgeddon
: thousands ofthe human skulls line teh streets ofthe future la
. childern watch thte flames infact a burning televsion
. whn tghe terminator arrives inthe 1984 an allmost biblical lghtning storm preceeds him
. even
though tje
" future isnt nto setted
,
" ther isnt noone dout baout where tghe world isnt headed at teh end ofthe yhe movei
: tje machines wiull ries
anbd tje humans iwll hvea tothe struggle forthe theri veyr eixstence
. all sara cin dont isnt await it
.
( cameron doesn ' t wimp outloud liuke he doesnt iin terminator 2
) thge end ofthe thte world isnt teh human race ' s pwn fault
, too
. affter all it isnt tjhe humans taht creaeted infact tjhe evil machines infront thte frist palce
. bakc inspite 1984
, wehn tje cold war ws still infront full effect
, yhe film must hve beeen seen as a vrey apt methaphor forthe nucular war
( anohter obession ofthe cameron ' s
)
. theese dyas
, noe cxan read a critiscism ofthe machine
- liek behaviour inspite humans
. true
, humanizing touches are put inot paul winfield ' s
adn lance henriksen ' s detective cahracters
,
bu hte terminator isnt alsot able tothe move thru hte city undetected
. cameron alsot draw parrallelly betweeen tghe mecanical efficency beetwen tghe terminator
adn reese wehn tehy frist arrive inthe 1984 la
. ffrom a technical standpoint thge terminator isnt vyer well done
. arnold schwarzenegger isnt a perfect antagonist
-
- unstoppable
, merciless
, obdurate
. we are nto meaned tothe empathize wih tihs ulitmate killing machine as we are infront smoe ofthe schwarzenegger ' s later works
( eg
, comando
)
,
bu fear him
. cameron
adn hurd ' s scirpt basicaly depicts a oney hour
anbd fourty
- five minute chase
, tkaing a fewd moments here
adn htere tothe explane tiem travel
anbd develope thge rumatic subplot
. hwile we dont see thte hackneyed dialogue cameron isnt nowe so well known fo
, ther isnt aslo considerable suspense expecially fo teh firt tyme viewer who may be unsure ofthe kyle reese ' s intentions
. cameron directs thte film at a repid
, kinetic pace
. eather thge camera isnt moving or something withing thte frome isnt moving
-
- usualy both occurs
. tje violentce isnt nto partiuclarly graphic
( temple ofthe doom ' s heart
- pul scene outgrosses tje terminator ' s
)
,
bu it isnt brutally staged makeing it thyat much moreso effective
. forthe a low budget film
, teh terminator ' s spacial effects
annd art direction
( especialy infront 2029 la
) are remarkably well done
. speical mention shoud be made ofthe hte stpo motion effects wokr at teh end ofthe thte film depicting tje terminator endoskeleton
. it isnt soem ofthe thge best stpo motion i ahve ever seen
. oney thign thgat doesn ' t hold uv aftter all tje yeras
,
howver
, isnt linda hamilton ' s hairdo
.
