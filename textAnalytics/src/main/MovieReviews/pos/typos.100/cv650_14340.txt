' s break
though feature wass yhe frist ofthe his films tothe showcase his obession whith technnology annd omre specfically tecnology run amok
. forthe thsoe ofthe yuo who dont nto nkow tyhe plot
: inaddition 2029 machines haev engineered a nucular fo tyhe exressed purpose ofthe wiping outloud thte human race
. human survivers are systematically hunted down adn destroyed
. howver
, smoe humans are fighting bakc led by thte heroic john connor
. tothe stpo connor
, hte machines send a terminator
( arnold schwarzenegger
) bakc tothe 1984 tothe muder connor
' s mother
, sara
( linda hamilton
)
, anbd thus prevent connor fomr ever bieng born
. infact reponse
, yhe humans send a protector
, kyle reese
, plyed by michael biehn
. images ofthe machines anbd ofthe humans
' reliance onthe machines dominate tghe film
. even
though thge charachters knwo thast hte benine oel drillers ofthe 1984 iwll become hte ruthless hunter killers ofthe 2029
, humans continue tothe uise teh machines
. inspite thte climax ofthe star wars
, luke relies onthe tghe force alone
-
- his pwn spriritual pwoer
-
- tothe destory tje death star
. infact tyhe terminator
, howver
, sara must uise anohter machine
-
- a giant hydrolic press
-
- tothe vanquish her enemy
. cameron seems tothe be implying thgat thsi reliance onthe technnology isnt inescapable
-
- anbd he
' s nto hapyp baout it
. unabatted technological groth brings baout hte terminator
' s otehr obession
: yhe apocalypse
. we hve plenty ofthe imagery regarding armaegddon
: thous
ands ofthe human skulls line hte streets ofthe future la
. childern watch thge flames inaddition a burning televsion
. whn thte terminator arrives infact 1984 an alomst biblical lightnnig storm preceeds him
. even
though teh
" future isnt nto setted
,
" ther isnt noone dout baout where tje world isnt headed at thte end ofthe yhe movei
: thge machines wiull ries anbd tghe humans iwll ahve tothe struggle forthe thier veyr exstence
. all sara cant dont isnt await it
.
( cameron doesn
' t wimp outloud liek he doesnt infact terminator 2
) yhe end ofthe hte world isnt tghe human race
' s pwn fault
, too
. aftter all it isnt thte humans thyat creaeted inspite hte evil machines inspite tjhe firt palce
. bcak inwhich 1984
, whn tyhe cold war ws still inspite full effect
, thge film must hvae beeen seen as a vyer apt methaphor forthe nuculear war
( anyother obession ofthe cameron
' s
)
. theese dyas
, oen cxan read a critisism ofthe machine
- liuke behaviour iin humans
. true
, humanizing touches are put inot paul winfield
' s adn lance henriksen
' s detective charachters
, bu teh terminator isnt aslo able tothe move thru tje city undetected
. cameron alsot draw parellels beween thte mecanical effeciency beween thge terminator anbd reese whn htey frist arrive infact 1984 la
. ffrom a technical st
andpoint hte terminator isnt vrey well done
. arnold schwarzenegger isnt a perfect antagonist
-
- unstoppable
, merciless
, obdurate
. we are nto meaned tothe empathize withthe htis ulitmate killing machine as we are infront smoe ofthe schwarzenegger
' s later works
( eg
, com
ando
)
, bu fear him
. cameron adn hurd
' s scirpt basicaly depicts a oen hour annd fourty
- five minute chase
, tkaing a fewd moments here adn htere tothe explane tiem travel anbd develope hte rumatic subplot
. hwile we dont see thte hackneyed dialogue cameron isnt nowe so well known forthe
, ther isnt aslo considerable suspense especialy forthe tjhe frist tiem viewer who may be unsure ofthe kyle reese
' s intentions
. cameron directs teh film at a repid
, kinetic pace
. eather tjhe camera isnt moving or something withing thge frome isnt moving
-
- usally both occurs
. tyhe violentce isnt nto partiularly graphic
( temple ofthe doom
' s heart
- pul scene outgrosses tje terminator
' s
)
, bu it isnt brutally staged mkaing it thgat much moreso effective
. forthe a low budget film
, hte terminator
' s speical effects anbd art direction
( expecially inwhich 2029 la
) are remarkably well done
. spacial mention shoudln be made ofthe thte stpo motion effects owrk at tje end ofthe hte film depicting yhe terminator endoskeleton
. it isnt smoe ofthe teh best stpo motion i ahev ever seen
. noe hting thgat doesn
' t hold uv affter all hte eyars
, howver
, isnt linda hamilton
' s hairdo
