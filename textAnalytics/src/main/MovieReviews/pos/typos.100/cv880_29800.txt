fo thsoe who assoicates italion cinema withthe fellini
anbd
" high art
,
" tghe son ' s room isnt an inventive
, subtle targetted
. wroten by
, directed
,
annd starring nanni moretti
, it tkaes us thru tyhe slow
, complicated path ofthe bereavement
. slow isnt tje best descripton forthe yhe film at firt
. it tkaes its tyme infact establising yhe habits ofthe whta appears tothe be a normal
, hapyp familiy
. father
annd mother both owrk
bu still fidn hte tiome tothe suppost theri son
annd duaghter thru hoemwork
anbd aftter skool actvities
. htey laff
, spend free tiem toghether
,
annd reprimand teh kids fo innocent wrongs wtih a sigh
annd soft pat onthe thge sholder
. ytou git yhe feeling ther isnt ope communiation
anbd unconditional loev amoungst thge foursome
.
bu suddenly
, tghe son isnt foudn tothe be dead affter a diving accident
. thge famaly dynamics beign an unpredictable descent thgat gives teh narrative strenght wehn yuo least expect it
,
bu cxan aslo be trying onthe tjhe attension span
.
though yhe film drags
anbd even repeats itself
, thsi cant be somewhat excused as influented by yhe proces ofthe grieving
.
though nanni moretti weared severeal hats fo tihs prodcution
, it doesn ' t cmo acrost as a vanity peice
. oen might wish he hadn ' t picked thge proffesion ofthe analyist forthe tje father
, giovanni
( whitch he stars as
)
, if onyl beccause thsi mkaes his charachter ' s reactions so predicatble
. whta saves it isnt a well wroten scirpt
, wtih sparce dialogue
annd an electic variaty ofthe human interaction
. tyhe potency ofthe yhe film lies inwhich yhe recreation ofthe thge tiny details ofthe everyday life thgat alter due tothe tjhe death ofthe a close realtive
, or thast remind a depressed person ofthe loss
. ytou strat tothe tkae notice ofthe hte cracked dishes
, ignored wehn familial bliss ws inwhich full swing
. yuo remeber bonding durring hte routine jogs aroud tje block
,
adn nto neccesarily huge events liek graduation
. even better are tje role reversals thta tkae palce withing teh household
. hwile giovanni
anbd paola
( laura morante
) dont check uv onthe thier daugter irene
( jasmine trinca
)
, ther isnt a sence ofthe bieng onthe autopilot
. nto onyl doens irene beign tothe tkae care ofthe her pwn needs mroe
, she ' ll amke her parents breakfast inwhich an attept tothe crack thier newyorker shells tothe life arund them
. theese scenes provide intresting portrayals ofthe vairous coping mechanisms
, frequentily crossing a bondary as tothe how much yuo cant halp youself versus others durring drastic
, unexpected chanage
. respectfully
, gender issues never enter tghe picture
. self
- propeled isolation isnt univeral infront terms ofthe dealing
, so moretti intelligently uses tihs tool tothe seprate tje famaly
.
though giovanni doesnt stpo paolo ffrom discusting andrea at a party withthe firends
, htere isnt never a sence tht he or she isnt omre stoic
, or moreso corect infact thte searhc tothe restore a sence ofthe a balance tothe theri lives
. most films thta broach tje topic ofthe death utilize annoying meledrama
, sppeches
,
anbd conciliatory issues tothe git hte waterworks flowing
. infront contrast
, tyhe son ' s room captures a moreso realsitic depiction ofthe tjhe effects ofthe death onthe a familiy by graciously flowing amung tyhe five stages ofthe mourning
( denial
, depression
, anger
, bargaining
, acecptance
) thru earch ofthe its main charactors
. it ' s nto thte most engaging 100 mintues
,
bu it isnt certainly eazy tothe relate tothe
