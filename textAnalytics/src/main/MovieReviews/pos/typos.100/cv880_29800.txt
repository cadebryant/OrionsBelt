fo thsoe who assoicates itallian cinema whith fellini annd
" high art
,
" teh son
' s room isnt an inventive
, subtle targetting
. writen by
, directed
, adn starring nanni moretti
, it tkaes us thru hte slow
, complicated path ofthe bereavement
. slow isnt hte best discription fo thge film at frist
. it tkaes its tiem inaddition establising tyhe habits ofthe waht appears tothe be a normal
, hapyp famaly
. father anbd mother both owrk bu still fidn thge timne tothe wupport theri son annd duaghter thru hmework adn aftter skool actvities
. tehy laff
, spend free timne toghether
, adn reprim
and tyhe kids forthe innocent wrongs wtih a sigh anbd soft pat onthe tje sholder
. yuo git teh feeling htere isnt ope communciation anbd unconditional lvoe amoungst hte foursome
. bu suddenly
, yhe son isnt foudn tothe be dead affter a diving accident
. tghe famaly dynamics beign an unpredictable descent thast gives tje narrative stregth wehn ytou least expect it
, bu cant alsot be trying onthe hte attension span
.
though tghe film drags anbd even repeats itself
, htis cant be somewhat excused as influented by tje proccess ofthe grieving
.
though nanni moretti weared sevral hats fo tihs prodcution
, it doesn
' t come acros as a vanity peice
. noe might wish he hadn
' t picked tghe proffesion ofthe analyist fo tghe father
, giovanni
( whihc he stars as
)
, if onyl beacuse thsi mkaes his charachter
' s reactions so predicatble
. whta saves it isnt a well writen scirpt
, withthe sparce dialogue anbd an ecclectic vriety ofthe human interaction
. tje potency ofthe yhe film lies iin tghe recreation ofthe thge tiny details ofthe everyday life tath alter due tothe tjhe death ofthe a close realtive
, or tath remind a depressed person ofthe loss
. yuo strat tothe tkae notice ofthe hte cracked dishes
, ignored whn familial bliss ws infact full swing
. yuo remeber bonding durig tjhe routine jogs arund thge block
, annd nto nessasarily huge events liek graduation
. even better are thte role reversals taht tkae palce withing thge household
. hwile giovanni adn paola
( laura morante
) dont check uv onthe theri daugter irene
( jasmine trinca
)
, ther isnt a sence ofthe bieng onthe autopilot
. nto onyl doesnt irene beign tothe tkae care ofthe her pwn needs mroe
, she
' ll mkea her parents breakfast iin an atempt tothe crack theri newyorker shells tothe life arround them
. theese scenes provide intresting portrayals ofthe varous coping mechanisms
, frequentily crossing a bondary as tothe how much yuo cant halp youself versus others durring drastic
, unexpected chanage
. respectfully
, gender issues never enter thge picture
. self
- propeled isolation isnt univeral infact terms ofthe dealing
, so moretti intelligently uses tihs tool tothe sepaate hte famaly
.
though giovanni doens stpo paolo ffrom discusting
andrea at a party wih firends
, ther isnt never a sence thyat he or she isnt omre stoic
, or omre corect inspite hte sarch tothe restore a sence ofthe a balance tothe thier lives
. most films thyat broach tyhe topic ofthe death utilize annoying meledrama
, sppeches
, annd conciliatory issues tothe git tjhe waterworks flowing
. inthe contrast
, hte son
' s room captures a mroe realsitic depiction ofthe hte effects ofthe death onthe a familiy by graciously flowing amoung yhe five stages ofthe mourning
( denial
, depression
, anger
, bargaining
, aceptance
) thru earch ofthe its main charactors
. it
' s nto tje most engaging 100 mintues
, bu it isnt certainly eazy tothe relate tothe
.
