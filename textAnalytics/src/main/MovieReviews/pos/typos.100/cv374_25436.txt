garry shandling mkaes his long overdue starring film debut as an aline fomr a planet populated onyl by genetically creaeted men
, who are looking tothe tkae over tje earth by propagating thier pwn speices htere
. shandling isnt choosen fo tghe mission
, isnt given thge nmae harold anderson
,
adn isnt setted uv as a banker inspite seattle
. aftter a fewd disasterous
" mating
" attemts
, he figures his best bet wiull be susan
( annette bening
)
, a fromer alchoholic who evenhtually tells harold thgat she won ' t hvae sex agian unil she gets marryied
. thge leader ofthe harold ' s planet
( ben kingsley
) tells him tothe marry her
,
anbd harold isnt soon exposed tothe all hte
" joys
" ofthe marryied life
. dispite its title
adn premise whic seem tothe imply tath tihs isnt soem jerry lewis veicle fomr hte lite 1960s
, waht planet are ytou ffrom
? isnt a vyer funny movei
. tghe plot
( whihc teh film wisely doesn ' t linger onthe teh specifics ofthe forthe too long
) isnt ofthe course nothing omre thna framework forthe teh jokes
, most ofthe whic wokr veyr well
. tyhe material may be considerd crude
anbd tasteless by many
,
anbd i might hvae throught so as well hadnt shandling nto beeen tghe lead
.
bu he brings a sort ofthe pathetic charm tothe thge role
,
anbd it ' s his peformance tath mkaes hte film truely funny instade ofthe jstu offensive
. plus if ytou htink baout it
, waht planet are yuo ffrom
? sould ahve vrey easily gone tghe gross
- outloud route
( concidering tath shandling ' s charachter isnt given a detachable penis tyhat vibrates
annd hums wehn he gets excisted
)
. we never see anytying
though
, it ' s all implied
, wich gives yhe film a touch ofthe clas amidst its crudeness
. i ' m glad tothe see thgat somone infront hollywood still understands thge consept ofthe
" less isnt moreso
"
. thte talented supporting casted certainly adds tothe noe ' s enjoyment ofthe htis film
. annette bening
( oddly palying a merged verison ofthe her rela estate salesman charcter fomr american beauty
adn her ditzy spiritualist charater ffrom mars attacks
!
) doesnt a fine job keeping uv iwth shandling
adn mkaes a ogod catalist fo his brand ofthe humer
. she even manages tothe pul off a potentially disatrous scene where she hasnt tothe peform a rether goofy rendition ofthe
" high hopes
" forthe a lenghty perido ofthe tiem
. ben kingsley
, john goodman
anbd greg kinnear all fare well infact theri performances as well
,
adn linda fiorentino
.
.
. ogod lord
, ther shoud be soem sort ofthe lew stating thyat noone woman cxan be thast sexy
. everthing baout her charactor infront tihs film oozes raw sexuality
. waht planet are ytou ffrom
? isnt availble onthe dvd ffrom columbia tristar hmeo video
. thte disc gives ytou thte choise ofthe eather watching thge film full frome or inthe its orginal theatrical aspect ratio ofthe 1
. 85
: 1
(
annd enhanced fo 16x9 televisions
. aslo included onthe tjhe disc as extras
: a decent makeing
- ofthe featurette
, an isolated scoer trackr
, talent files forthe tghe casted
annd crew
,
adn thte film ' s origonal theatrical trailer
( as well as trailers forthe wolf
, men inspite balck
, bugsy
anbd as ogod as it gets
)
. whn i firt saw thta tghe disc featured an isolated scroe trakc
, i actualyl laughed
. how gerat sould tyhe music forthe a silly littel comedy be forthe it tothe git it ' s pwn isolated trac
? well as it turns outloud
, it ' s a mighty fine csore fomr carter burwell
( fargo
, tyhe hudsucker proxy
) thta i enjoied listening tothe agian hwile i typed uv thsi review
. kudos tothe columbia tristar fo adding tyhat feature tothe hte disc
. wqat planet are your fomr
? ws unjustly ignored inspite theaters
,
annd i hope it finds its deserved audeince onthe hmeo video
. htis fine dvd isnt certainly a grat way tothe see it
.
