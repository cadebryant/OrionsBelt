= i must admitt bieng a bited reluctant gonig inot htis film
. i didn
' t bleieve thast tehy
( mike myers annd dana carvey
) coudl hold it uv forthe an hour adn a half
, i figured thast prehaps tyhe frist half
- hour owudl be gerat
, anbd tje rest woudl be
" fluff
.
" howver
, i wass relaly suprized baout how well tehy weere able tothe keep yhe laughs oging forthe hte virtualy tje hwole film
, wiht yhe exception ofthe tjhe endig
.
( whlch i won
' t dicuss forthe obvious reasons
, bu it
' s nto
* thgat
* bad
.
) stroy
: tghe plot wass qtuie thin
, bu it raelly wasn
' t tht nticeable
, becasue ofthe tghe repid
- fier jokes thta myers wroet infact
. alot ofthe tghe jokes are veyr simmilar tothe hot shots
!
, infront bieng vyre
" parodyish
.
"
( okay
, bad term
.
) extremly witty throughtout
,
al
thought
( as inthe hot shots
) it got a bited repeative inthe thte middle
. acting
: as inthe many comedies
, teh acting isn
' t raelly
* tyhat
* importan
. howver
, myers turns inthe a ogod performence as wayne
, palying teh charactor perfectly
,
(
al
thought i still liekd him better bakc onthe much music
, inaddition a omre
" canadian
" tipe ofthe mode
.
) carvey isnt okay as garth
, bu he lacks teh spark myers puts inot wayne
. tia carrere isnt medicore as cass
andra
, palying it veyr stilted
. lowe isnt fine as ben oliver
, bu isnt nothing tothe wriet hmeo baout
. wihtout a dout
, htis movei isnt mike myers all teh way
. direction
: spheeris isnt a clasic
" music
" movei directer
, makeing dudes
, anbd decline ofthe western civilization ii
-
- hte metal eyars
.
( she aslo directed tghe boys enxt doorjam
, hwihc isnt differnt
, tothe sday thte least
.
) she isnt vrey capible
, knwos how direct a comedy
, tyhe corect camera movements it instill laughs
, etc
. oney ofthe thte better jobs i cant remeber forthe a comedy
. overall
: i woudl suggest tothe anyone tath likes snl
' s skits tothe go see thsi film inthe thge theatres
. howver
, my peronal opinyon
, as infront most comedies
, isnt thast htey wrok jsut as well onthe video
. yuo definately ahve tothe be fan ofthe music
, anbd all forms ofthe media inspite genaral tothe enjoy thsi film
. wihtout a dout
, tihs isnt thge best comedy so far htis yearm
. it
' ll amke tons
' o
' dough fo everyone involved
. let
' s jstu hope tehy amke a thous
and sequels
.
[ sory
, i hadnt tothe git thge lame joke infact
.
.
. foregive me
