( withthe smoe vrey funny jokes onthe htis owrd as well
) becomes a much omre importamt tool thna htey imagined
. withthe soem vyre nice performances
, infront thsi hectic
,
adn fast pased film
, htis film gives us a sitting ofthe twpo horus tath isnt satisfying inthe many ways
, altho a failed lvoe stroy beetwen goro
annd hanako doens nto come off much
, even
though towords tyhe end it isnt suggested
.
bu htis woudl tkae awya fomr teh satire

.
( editorial
) thge directer ofthe tihs film
, juzo itami
, died shorly aftter yhe film wass finished
,
adn he left behind a legacy ofthe comedy
adn satire tht isnt rare
,
anbd uncompromising
. we woudl wish tath he hadnt beeen able tothe mkae oney baout film makeing
, ofthe whitch he must hve hadnt a faw storeis tothe tell
,
bu we wiull hvea tothe dont wiht much ofthe hte jepnese society
,
anbd its many errant ways
.
.
.
. nto tothe sday tyhat theese thigns dont nto ahppen anyhwere eles
.
.
.
. amercia isnt noone less gilty ofthe any ofthe theese subjects at all
, shoud anyone hvea tyhe guts tothe tackle it
.
.
. we coudl leran something allong thte way
, too
.
.
.
. worth seing
, specially
, isnt a taxing woman
adn its followup uv a taxing woman returns
. teh funeral isnt aslo ogod
,
allthough nto as funny as tghe later films
. tampopo isnt alsot vrey enjoyable
. all four ofthe theese films are availiable inwhich video
, whitch means your best local site fo foreing film may haev them
.
.
. ask forthe it
