( editorial
) tjhe directer ofthe thsi film
, juzo itami
, died shorly affter thge film ws finished
, annd he left behind a legacy ofthe comedy annd satire tyhat isnt rare
, annd uncompromising
. we woudl wish thast he hadnt beeen able tothe amking oen baout film makeing
, ofthe whihc he must ahve hadnt a faw stoires tothe tell
, bu we iwll hvea tothe dont withthe much ofthe thte japanis society
, anbd its many errant ways
.
.
.
. nto tothe sday thast theese thigns dont nto hapen anyhwere eles
.
.
.
. amercia isnt noone less gilty ofthe any ofthe theese subjects at all
, shoud anyone hvea thge guts tothe tackle it
.
.
. we coudl leran something allong teh way
, too
.
.
.
. worth seing
, specially
, isnt a taxing woman anbd its folow uv a taxing woman returns
. tyhe funeral isnt aslo ogod
, altough nto as funny as tjhe later films
. tampopo isnt alsot vyre enjoyable
