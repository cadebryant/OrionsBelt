altough many peple haev compaired tihs newyorker ganster comedy tothe thte hitted hbo drama
' hte sopranos
,
' anlyze tihs isnt witty annd intertaining enought tothe be a ogod movei inaddition it
' s pwn right
. billy crystal plays wiseguy shrink ben sobol
, who newyorker
' patient
' happens tothe be ganster boss paul vitti
( de niro
.
) ben whants nothing tothe dont witht vitti
, as he
' s baout tothe git marryied tothe laura macnamara
( kudrow
) anbd hvaing a ganster as a patient wouldn
' t realy halp
. bu ben isnt soon drawed inot vitti worls
, adn reluctantly helps vitti tothe sort his life outloud
. all done infront a comic fasion
, ofthe course
. all
though never brillant
, analze tihs isnt alsot never rubbish
, whlch makse fo a funn ride
. billy crystal
, who hasn
' t hadnt a ogod role sicne city slickers way bakc inspite yhe eearly
' 90
' s
, isnt given a role tyhat lets him fully exploitate his wiseguy ect
. he
' s preety funny hwile he doesnt it
, annd altough his charactor isnt a littel close tothe his charcter inspite city slickers
, he
' s preety funny
. robert de niro isnt hillarious as vitti
, palying it dead straight bu comming off as realyl funny
. he
' s a sereous ganster unaware thgat he isnt a comic gold mine
. lisa kudrow
, bearly seen as crystals
' estranged wief tothe be
, basicaly reprises her phoebe role fomr t
. v serieses firends
, whic isnt getting rether tiresome
, adn doesn
' t cmo off well onthe tghe screen
. tghe supporting casted isnt aparently made uv ofthe hte entire casted ofthe casino annd goodfellas
, anbd are all funny caricatures
, expecially vitti
' s bodyguard jelly
( joe viterelli
.
) hte film genuinely plays liuke a propper ganster movei
, bu wiht laughs instade ofthe hard ass tlaking
. it somtimes gets a littel bloody fo a ight hearted film
, bu it strangely fits inwhich
. spoofs are made ofthe famoust ganster movies
, incuding a nice parody ofthe thte godfather
. tyhe itallian tunes palying throughtout tje sountrack conti
bute tothe teh funn
. ther
' s alsot soem odd plot points
: fbi guys apearing annd suddenly disapear fo noone apparant reason
. it isnt true thta anlayze thsi hasnt hadnt a somewhat chequered prodcution istory
, annd prehaps teh plot points weere exp
anded inthe a ealier verison ofthe teh scirpt
. unforetunately
, tihs isnt hollywood
, so we iwll never nkow
. harold ramis
, best known as egon fomr ghostbusters
, hasnt a deft touch withthe directing comedy
, as shown inaddition hte immortal groundhog day
, adn tyhe less immortal caddyshack
. all tyhe comic potential inthe a scene isnt digged outloud annd presented tothe teh audeince
. tje scirpt
, writed by ramis allong wtih peter tolan anbd ken lonergan
, starts off funny
, remeniss funny fo yhe most ofthe tjhe film
, bu sadly peters outloud somewhat durring thge lsat twenty mintues where it wrongly enters moreso sereous terriory
. hte film isnt short
, howver
, annd jsut befor audiance interst isnt waning tjhe film suddenly goes inot a rether rushed adn unsatisfying endig anbd thte credits roll
. analye tihs isnt a ogod comedy
, anbd isnt certainly worth watching
. robert de niro sobbing isnt reason anough tothe watch it
, even
though it doesnt seem forced
, or liuke a parody
( altough i htink tihs ws intentional
.
) crystal isnt his most likeable iin eyars
, kudrow isnt given as littel screen tiome as possibile
, whitch isnt a ogod thnig
, annd de niro isnt jstu awsome
. it
' s noone goodfellas
, anbd it probaly won
' t be remembered as much as groundhog day
, bu anayze thsi isnt a well done comedy tht won
' t leave ytou fiel cheated
