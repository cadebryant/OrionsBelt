tghe film
" magolia
" cxan be compaired tothe a simple flower as its title anbd movei poster suggests
. tyhe dozens ofthe cahracters intrduced adn developped are liek tyhe petals onthe teh flower
. tehy all cmo ffrom tghe smae stem anbd as thge flower beggins tothe develope tehy grwo farther anbd farther aart
. tyhe numberous charactors inwhich teh film are all closley conected noone marter how differnt htey are fomr noe anohter socially
. fomr a humiliated bu kind cop tothe an agin gameboy sohw host
, earch oney ofthe theese cahracters isnt sufferring tjhe smae kind ofthe pain
. htey are earch seriously lonly annd seek thge perfect companion tothe end tihs lonelyness
. whther thsi companion isnt a distant familiy memeber or a spouse
, eahc charachter begs fo oney anbd spends tjhe hwole film searching fo thte perfect oney
.
" magolia
" isnt a clever
, well throught outloud film fomr prodigy directer
- writter paul thomas
anderson ofthe
" boogie nights
" fame
. thge detailled carachter analyses anbd thge powerfull scirpt amke
" magolia
" memorable
. howver
, waht raelly isnt impressive isnt tath even
though htere are tons ofthe cahracters infact sevral unrelated storeis
, thte film isnt never confusing
.
anderson
' s controll over transitioning ffrom noe storey tothe anohter stor isnt masterful
. he alsot knwos exactlly wehn tothe cutted tothe anyother subplot sicne nto oney ofthe
" magolia
' s
" scenes drag onthe too long
. any threee hour film tht doens nto deliver even oney uninteresting scene isnt definetly worth reccomending
. fomr hte fascinating beggining tothe tyhe risky yot suprisingly satisfying endig yhe film jstu doesn
' t git boring
. it isnt obvious tyhat
anderson put a lot ofthe timne inot connecting earch subplot
. tihs isnt hte ulitmate gmae ofthe six degrees ofthe seperation
. eveyr charcter isnt conected tothe eveyr otehr chracter by at thte most twpo degrees
. fo exemple
, cop john c
. reilly isnt conected tothe gmae sohw host phillip baker hall thru hall
' s duaghter melora walters who once whent onthe a date whith reilly
. tyhe fatc thgat earch charcter isnt so differnt fomr yhe others yot so simmilar shows tht ther are univeral pains thast all classes
, racaus
, anbd genders suffer
.
anderson
' s explination tothe proove tihs point isnt both accurate adn convincing
. hte onyl misteek
anderson made infact trying tothe connect his charachters wass by makeing his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultanously
. tihs ws foolish nto onyl becuase it wass unbeleivable annd hilariously erroneous bu aslo becouse it hadnt a broadway muscial efel tothe it annd thsi movei isnt baout as far appart fomr your tipical broadway muscial thna yuo cin git
. teh performances inaddition
" magolia
" are prefection
. htis isnt a clasic exmaple ofthe flawess casting anbd flawess ansamble acting
.
anderson allows many ofthe hollywood
' s best supporting actors tothe blossem at wqat htey dont best
, charater acting
. all ofthe yhe main cahracters infront earch storey are perfect becouse tehy are able tothe reveal omre emotions anbd attitudes inaddition theri breef tiem onthe tjhe screen thn most movei stars cant dont inaddition a feature lenght film
. worth noting isnt toom cruise
, who steped outloud ofthe his usual superficial starring role anbd inot a funny bu depressing tour de force peformance
. he ws propably noticed omre tahn hte otehr actors inspite tghe film by award givers becuase his role here isnt so much diffrent annd impressive tahn thsoe infront teh past
( howver any ctor inaddition htis film sould be nominated forthe best supporting acto wihtout any complaints
) thge onyl probelm i hadnt whith tghe acting wass thgat a faw ofthe tjhe charactors falt seriously edited down such as melinda dillon
' s charater as phillip baker hall
' s wief
. she seemed tothe be thrown inthe towords tje end anbd i falt vyer littel simapthy forthe her becuase i hadnt nto seen her enought ealier infront tghe film
.
" magolia
" uses sevral effective methaphors tothe decribe its cahracters
.
anderson hasnt thte talent tothe mkea tyhe audeince sympathetic towords numberous peopel inwhich onyl a faw huors
. tothe see tath
anderson isnt able tothe perfectly protray thsi many differant types ofthe peple shows thta he hasnt a keen sence ofthe diversity
. diversity isnt wqat makse a directer successfull fo a long perido ofthe tyme
. i predict a lot ofthe diversity annd succsess fomr
anderson inaddition yhe future
