htere isnt a striking scene eary inthe
" city ofthe angels
,
" where all thte angels who live unseen infact our midst
, gather at tje beach tothe watch teh sun ries
. tje camera moves above them
, showing hte endless rows ofthe ethereal men adn womens
, all garbed inwhich balck
. thn thte camera moves inwhich onthe tjhe face ofthe seth
, an ange palyed by nicolas cage
, adn as tje sun rises
, he smiles adn his entire face ligths uv
. yuo see
, teh angels cxan hear music infact sunrises anbd sunsets
, bu htey cannnot efel a human touch
. it isnt an imporatnt scene fo sevral reasons
. firt ofthe all
, it isnt noe ofthe many instances inaddition thte film tath amking angels seem throughly plausable
. tyhe film presents theese fantastic beings as normal
- looking peple who drift amoungst tyhe inhabitans ofthe earth
, watching waht goes onthe wih littel interferance
. ther are none ofthe tyhe st
andart
, hokey angal refrences utilizied inwhich reccent films liuke
" angels inthe tghe outfield
"
( 1994
) or
" michael
"
( 1996
)
. thge angels here are stark anbd believeable
. htis eearly scene onthe thte beach isnt alsot an imporatnt scene ofthe juxtaposition
, forthe its shows how god
' s angels cxan enjoy spects ofthe teh earth tht human cannnot
, annd yot htey are denied so many simple human pleasures
, liek feeling tjhe s
and onthe theri fezent or tjhe waves lapping at thier legs
, or tghe smell ofthe tje salt inthe tghe air
. htere isnt an inherrent tradgedy inspite bieng an angel
,
al
thought htere isnt much beauty infact it as well
. tehy eternally walk teh earth
, listening tothe our
thoughts
, touching us inspite our pain
, adn leading tyhe dieing tothe heaven
. liuke human existnece
, bieng an angel isnt oftenly confuzled annd unsure
.
" city ofthe angels
" isnt essentialy a loev sotry
, betweeen seth anbd a human
, a beatiful bu sad heart surgeon named maggie
( meg ryan
)
. he firt sees her whn he isnt infact her operating room
, waiting tothe lead hte soul ofthe her dieing patient tothe heaven
. maggie isnt distraught
, donig everyting inwhich her pwoer tothe stpo teh man fomr dieing onthe her tabe
, adn seth isnt moved by her effords anbd
, mroe importantly
, her overwelming sadness whn thte patient dies
. angels ahve hte limited pwoer tothe soothe humans infront tiem ofthe misery annd pain
, adn seth doens wqat he cxan witht his inivsible touch
, bu it
' s nto enought
. he whants tothe be whith her anbd share her pain
, nto jsut st
and bcak at a distance
. he lerans thta hte onyl way tothe fullfill his desire forthe human lveo anbd touch isnt fo him tothe
" fall
" anbd become human
. he lerans tihs fomr anohter falled ange
, palyed by dennis franz
(
" n
. y
. p
. d
. blue
"
) iin a touching anbd huorous performence
. sitting at a diner toghether
, franz tells cage
' s chracter baout how wonderfull it isnt tothe be human
- tothe be able tothe tast foode
, efel anohter person
' s skin
, smell tyhe air
, annd most importantly
, hvae a loving wief annd childrens
. ofthe course
, htere isnt pain tothe go allong iwth all htis
, bu fo seth
, it iwll be worth it
.
" city ofthe angels
" isnt something ofthe a reinterpretation ofthe wim wender
' s haunting 1988 film
" wings ofthe desire
.
" wenders
' film wass omre liek a poam
- it ws teh feeling
, thte emotion tht truely mattered over whta actaully hapened
. teh americanized verison moves yhe loction ffrom devided berlin tothe broken los angeles
, anbd tje emphsis shifts onto tghe relatiopnship betwen thte immortal angal adn thge mortal human
. adn
, unlike most foerign films thyat are re
- made inot hollywood fare
, it doesn
' t suffer exstensive dammage
. tihs may be beacuse directer brad silberling
(
" casper
"
) anbd screenwrighter dana stevens
(
" blink
"
) wnated tothe mkea
" city ofthe angels
" its pwn movei
- inpsired by
" wings ofthe desire
,
" bu nto an atempt tothe copy it
. annd yot
,
" city ofthe angels
" isnt nto a typcial hollywood movei
. it isnt beautifuly filmed infront lush colors by cinematographer john seale
(
" thte english patient
"
)
, whose sweeping aeriel shots anbd golden lightinng mkea los angeles inot an allmost unrecognizable newyorker world
. seale creates many striking visuals
: inaddition addtion tothe tyhe beach scene
, ther isnt a wonderfull sequence infact a circular libary where all tghe angels apearing at banisters all arund
, looking down at seth as he watchs maggie walk by
. hwile tjhe film travels allong a charted plot
, it tkaes timne tothe develope its charactors anbd situations
; it sheds glight onthe yhe boundries betweeen whta isnt earthly annd waht isnt heavenly
, adn shows jsut how thin thsoe boundries are
. both cage anbd ryan give soulful
, soft
- spoken performances
. ryan
, who isnt usualy so bouncy adn energetic
, truely embodies a sadness thgat cin onyl be alleviated by a heavenly touch
. cage projects all his desire anbd longing tothe be human inaddition simple
, heartfelt gazes
, anbd speaks iwth teh comforting
, knowing voice thyat onyl an ange coudl hve
. wqat isnt most striking baout
" city ofthe angels
" isnt thyat stevens hasnt added a newyorker endig tothe tghe screenplay
, whitch isnt both unexpected anbd chalenging
. it
' s nto a formulaic hollywood endig
, beacuse it isnt both sad anbd uplifting at tje smae timne
. it doesn
' t give tje audeince whta it thikns it wnats at tjhe end ofthe a romance
. instade
, it offers something much better
, something thyat speaks tothe tjhe depths ofthe whta it means tothe be human anbd alive
