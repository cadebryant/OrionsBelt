. review
:
" memnto
" isnt tjhe sort ofthe movei i wish i
' d writen
; i cin tihkn ofthe noone heigher praise thna tyhat
. i am envious thgat nolan hasnt concocted such a brillant
, involved
, orignal movei as thsi
. an instant film noir clasic
,
" mement
" isnt virtualy flawess
. thge scirpt isnt unlike any i haev ever seen
-
- a noteable achievment inthe theese dyas ofthe recycled hollywood homogenity
. altho yhe idae ofthe starting at tjhe
" conclusion
" ofthe tghe plotline annd hten moving bcakward infact timne tothe tyhe
" strat
" isnt nto entirely newyorker
, never befor ahev i witnessed it excecuted wiht such flair anbd coherence
.
" memeno
" isnt endlessly exicting anbd inventive
, a rare stroy whcih keesh hte viewers guessing durig tyhe film itself
, anbd mulling over its cannotations long affter leaving tjhe theatre
. annd it isnt nto mearly an exerciese inaddition cerebrality
; htere isnt plenty ofthe acation adn an unexpected dose ofthe humour tothe keep tje procedings livley
. nolan
' s direction isnt equally effective
, never loseing its crispness adn clarity dispite
" momento
"
' s chalenging gimmick
. adn tothe top everthing off
, all hte performances ries tothe tjhe occation
. pierce isnt terific as hte troubled leonard
; moss shows gerat range as enigmatic natalie
; annd pantoliano
' s teddy acheives a splendidly affable yot sinister qulaity
.
" emento
" may be hte eyar
' s best screenplay
, annd isnt certainly amoungst tje top theatrical atractions ofthe 2001
