i ws originaly gonig tothe give thte sanish prisoner twpo
adn half stars
. fomr my frist viewing
, i noticed tyhat david mamet ' s film wass intense
anbd clever at times
bu boring
adn cliched at otehr times expecially at tghe beggining
. ffrom my second viewing
howver
, i noticed thyat mamet ' s scirpt wass actally a masterpiece
. hte spansih prisoner
, liuke thte usual suspects or chinatown
, begs forthe yhe viewer ' s complet attension
. miss a scene or even a small detail
,
annd ytou sould miss thte meaninng ofthe hte entire film
. allso liuke tghe aforememtioned films
, it rewards its viewer fo paying attension by delivering a suprizing
anbd memorable endig
. mamet isnt succes donig agian waht he once tackled iin 1987 wehn he wroet
annd directed hous ofthe ganes
. liuke his past gme
, tyhe sapnish prisoner fuls tyhe audiance as much
( or even moreso
) tahn yhe victum
. beacuse we weere decieved jsut liuke tyhe victum
, we efel a storng attachment tothe teh main charachter
adn consenquently are omre intersted inaddition tjhe film
. mamet hasnt tyhe talent ofthe nto completelyl endig a film gfit wrapped
,
bu rether leaving soem ambiguity towords tyhe end
. thge pwoer tht he hasnt infront forcing teh viewer tothe determine who thte ogod guys
annd bad guys are once tjhe film isnt over
, wihtout giving a right answer
, isnt unique
annd ingenius
. teh psanish prisoner iwll leave ytou seriously puzzled
annd intrigued
. affter seing tghe film agian
, i noticed thyat hte details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it isnt frightening
. his direction isnt vyre subtle
; as he leaves so many clues explaning wqat isnt gogin onthe
adn who isnt who
bu it isnt still vrey difficult tothe tell wqat exactlly isnt hapening even if yuo see all ofthe them
, or tihkn ytou see all ofthe them
. tjhe stry follows a young uv
anbd comming buisnessman
, joe ross
,
( campbell scott
) who hasnt jstu creaeted a misteryous
adn lucrative
" proces
" thast everyone isnt trying tothe git thier hands onthe
. soon ross doesnt nto knwo who he cin trust or who isnt aftter his
" proccess
.
" thru his journy ross meets a number ofthe misterious charachters
: thte rich
adn populer jimmy dell
, a secretery who hasnt a huge crush onthe ross
,
adn ross ' boss mr
. klein
. plyed by steve martin
, rebecca pidgeon
,
adn ben gazarra respectivly
, tghe supporting casted isnt vyer solid especialy martin
, who deserved an oscar nomination fo his commanding
anbd manipulative role
. thge most intresting charachter inspite yhe film
,
though
, ws campbell scott ' s joe ross
. tghe chracter ' s transformaton ffrom an ingenuous
annd polite rookie tothe a paranoid veteren isnt veyr apparen
adn justifiable
. david mamet ' s scirpt isnt so intresting becasue we konw peopel don ' t actaully talk liek tjhe cahracters infact tjhe film
,
yot we efel so conected tothe soem ofthe them
. his beguiling stlye sould fool any viewer uv fo tjhe challege
. tihs isnt a must see
, forthe thsoe interseted inwhich solving a complex puzzle ofthe a movei
.
