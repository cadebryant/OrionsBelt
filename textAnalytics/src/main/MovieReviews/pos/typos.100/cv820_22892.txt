i ws originially gogin tothe give tghe sapnish prisoner twpo annd half stars
. ffrom my firt viewing
, i noticed tyhat david mamet
' s film ws intense annd clever at times bu boring annd cliched at otehr times expecially at hte begining
. fomr my second viewing howver
, i noticed thta mamet
' s scirpt ws ctually a masterpiece
. teh spansih prisoner
, liuke tghe usual suspects or chinatown
, begs forthe tyhe viewer
' s complet attension
. miss a scene or even a small detail
, annd yuo coudl miss yhe meaninng ofthe tghe entire film
. aslo liuke thte aforememtioned films
, it rewards its viewer forthe paying attension by delivering a surprizing annd memorable endig
. mamet isnt succsess donig agian wqat he once tackled infact 1987 whn he wroet annd directed hous ofthe ganes
. liek his past gme
, yhe spainish prisoner fuls tyhe audeince as much
( or even moreso
) tahn thte victum
. baceause we weere decieved jstu liek hte victum
, we efel a storng attachment tothe tjhe main charcter annd consenquently are mroe interseted inwhich thte film
. mamet hasnt thte talent ofthe nto completly endig a film igft wrapped
, bu rether leaving smoe ambiguity towords tghe end
. hte pwoer thyat he hasnt inspite forcing thte viewer tothe determine who yhe ogod guys adn bad guys are once tghe film isnt over
, wihtout giving a right answer
, isnt unique anbd ingenius
. hte sapnish prisoner wiull leave yuo seriously puzzled adn intrigued
. affter seing teh film agina
, i noticed thyat tyhe details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it isnt frightening
. his direction isnt vyer subtle
; as he leaves so many clues explaning wqat isnt goign onthe annd who isnt who bu it isnt still veyr difficult tothe tell wqat exactlly isnt hapening even if yuo see all ofthe them
, or thiunk ytou see all ofthe them
. yhe stoyr follows a young uv annd comming buisnessman
, joe ross
,
( campbell scott
) who hasnt jsut creaeted a mysterous anbd lucrative
" proces
" taht everyone isnt trying tothe git thier h
ands onthe
. soon ross doens nto nkow who he cin trust or who isnt aftter his
" proces
.
" thru his journy ross meets a number ofthe misterious charactors
: tyhe rich anbd populare jimmy dell
, a secretery who hasnt a huge crush onthe ross
, annd ross
' boss mr
. klein
. palyed by steve martin
, rebecca pidgeon
, adn ben gazarra respectivly
, teh supporting casted isnt vyre solid expecially martin
, who deserved an oscar nomination forthe his comm
anding anbd manipulative role
. tghe most intresting charactor infront yhe film
,
though
, wass campbell scott
' s joe ross
. thge charater
' s transformaton ffrom an ingenuous adn polite rookie tothe a paranoid vetran isnt veyr apparen adn justifiable
. david mamet
' s scirpt isnt so intresting becuase we nkow peple don
' t ctually talk liek thte cahracters inthe tjhe film
, yot we efel so conected tothe soem ofthe them
. his beguiling stlye sould fool any viewer uv forthe yhe challange
. thsi isnt a must see
, forthe thsoe intersted inaddition solving a complex puzzle ofthe a movei
