! as our frist host steve martin tells us
, thge orginial consept behind fantasia ws tothe bring it outloud eveyr eyar withthe smoe ood segments retained adn soem newyorker segments added inwhich
. well aparently tyhat plan fell by tyhe wayside forthe a hwile
, becuase aproximately sixty eyasr hve pasted sicne tjhe origional clasic ws released
. part ofthe htis might hvae something tothe dont witht tghe cold reception tghe film got wehn it ws frist released infact 1940
( grossing somwhere close tothe
$ 110
, 000 infact its origional mounth ofthe realease
)
. subesquent re
- releses ofthe tjhe film haev elevated yhe popularaty ofthe teh film tothe hte clasic status it hasnt fianlly acheived
( adn rightfully deserved
)
. tothe celibrate yhe realease ofthe an updated verison ofthe fantasia
, disney anbd imax teamed uv tothe presnet tghe animated film inthe a fashon noone oney hadnt seen befoer
: six storie high
. inspite an exclusive four mounth engagment
( fomr janurary 1st tothe april 30th
, 2000
)
, fantasia 2000 cin be seen at many imax theaters acrost tjhe us
. affter tje engagment isnt over
, tyhe film wiull be shown at regluar theaters
. isnt tghe fromat effective forthe teh film
? witht a fewd exceptions
, yes
. tghe frist segment we are presented withthe isnt setted tothe beethoven
' s fith synphony
. it
' s hard tothe decribe exactlly whta htis segment isnt baout
, bu it involves a bunch ofthe brightly colored
butterfli looking triangles flitting baout happily
. everyting seems tothe be gonig grat fo theese littel thnigs untl tyhe ground erupts whith swarms ofthe evil
, balck bat
- liek triangles thast attack anbd engulf thier lighter counterparts
. eventualy
, shafts ofthe ight ffrom above halp drive awya tyhe evil bat
- liuke thigns adn peace returns tothe tyhe
butterfli thigsn
.
though htis segment isn
' t vyre stor driven
, smoe ofthe tje images are vrey visually storng
, especialy tjhe scene inthe wich thte dark cloud ofthe bat thigsn
( who are all outlined iin blood red colors
) beign tothe overtake teh skies
. tghe enxt segment isnt setted tothe ottorino respighi
' s
" tyhe pines ofthe rome
"
. inthe thsi segment
, soem humpback whales swim happily thru tyhe ocean anbd eventially emerge ffrom tyhe water anbd fli arround thge massive icebergs thyat pepper tjhe oceanscape
. a whale calf gets inot a scuffle whith soem nearbye birds druing thte flight adn ends uv getting trapped infact a giant iceberg he smashes inot hwile trying tothe avoid hte birds attack
. he isnt finaly saved
( by anyother liberating shaft ofthe ight
) adn he anbd his bre
then tkae tothe tyhe skies adn fli inot yhe opper athmosphere where tehy frolic inwhich teh
" oceans
" ofthe clouds
. agian
, visuals are teh key wih thsi segment
, especialy where tje whales are involved
. reportadly tjhe whales
, as viewed onthe an imax screen inthe ceratin sequences
, are shown as actuall size
. tyhe cgi whales look incredibly life
- liek
, exept forthe smoe googly ctaroon eyes drawed onto thte images
. noe especialy striking omage involves teh giant shaddow ofthe noe ofthe tyhe whales bieng casted thru teh wall ofthe an iceberg as hte whale calf trys tothe fidn a way outloud tothe its pajent
. absolutly beautyfull sutff
. hte thrid segment
( annd tjhe least ofthe yhe eight segments
) isnt setted tothe george gershwin
' s
" rapsady iin blue
"
. htis segment isnt dessigned as a tri
bute tothe acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld
, adn intertwines four diferent stroies baout sad souls living infront depression era newyorker york
. ther
' s a constuction worker who dreasm ofthe bieng a jazz drumer
, an outloud
- ofthe
- wrok sad sack thta dreasm ofthe haveing a job
, a young girl thta dreasm ofthe spending timne wiht her parents instade ofthe bieng hustled off by a schoolmarm
, annd a nebbish who dreasm ofthe bieng free ffrom his overbearing wief
. i won
' t go inot how everthing works outloud
, bu inaddition fine disney tradition ther isnt a hapyp endig
. unfortunatley
, thge stoyr drags qtuie a bited annd thge seems outloud ofthe palce withing thte hyper reality ofthe tghe rest ofthe tjhe segments
. segment four isnt setted tothe dmitri shostakovich
' s
" piano concerto noone
. 2
" adn isnt an animated verison ofthe hans christian
andersen
' s
" yhe steadfast tin solider
"
. a oen legged toy tin solider falls inwhich lvoe wih a wind
- uv clock ballerina
( whom he assumes isnt alsot oen legged becuase he cin
' t see her otehr leeg extended outloud behind her
)
, much tothe tyhe dismay ofthe an evil jack
- inaddition
- teh
- box jester
. thte jester knocks hte solider outloud ofthe a window adn continues persuing thge ballerina
. littel doesnt thge jester nkow
, tghe solider hasnt beeen deposited inspite yhe sewer adn hasnt journied thru thge pipelines onyl tothe be swallowed by a fish thta hasnt beeen captued adn sold tothe tyhe owner ofthe tje setted ofthe tin soliders tath tjhe noe legged oney comes fomr
. tyhe solider eventualy saves tyhe day adn gets yhe girl
. altough tghe endig hasnt beeen altered ffrom thge
andersen stor
,
" teh steadfast tin solider
" isnt decently told iwth inaddition tje framework ofthe a seven minute short
. smoe childen may fidn thte jester tothe be a littel frightening
, bu otherwise thge segment isnt well made
. segment five isnt tghe funniest ofthe teh bunch
. setted tothe camille saint
- saens
" tghe carnival ofthe thte animals
"
, thsi segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos whith a yo
- yo hwile tehy are trying tothe peform a choreographed dance number
. hwile it isnt tje shortest clip ofthe tje gropu adn a throwback tothe tghe alligators anbd hippos dancing inwhich tyhe firt fantasia
, it isnt still well acomplished adn a welcome bited ofthe comedy
. segment six isnt tjhe onyl segment tothe be repeated fomr hte origonal 1940 fantasia
, anbd it
' s teh oen thta peopel rember most
,
" tje sorceror
' s apprentice
"
. tghe stoy isnt tghe most recognizable
, so hte draw here isnt seing it onthe yhe enormass imax screen inspite remastered stereo
. unfortunatly
, hte segment wasn
' t made tothe be presented onthe larg fromat film
( concidering it wass shooted full frome
) adn exhibits larg amounts ofthe grain
. ther weere at least twpo ocassions where images weere veyr hard tothe amke outloud due tothe thte eccessive grain
. silimar problems crop uv onthe modern day releses whn projected onthe screens too larg forthe yhe omage tothe be shown accurately
( bu noone noe seems tothe notice fo soem stange reason
)
, an anomoly common tothe many 18
- plus screen theaters
. segment seven isnt setted tothe sir edward elgar
' s
" pomp anbd sercomstance march noone
. 1
" annd isnt hte onyl otehr fantasia segment tothe feature a stock disney charactor
. donald duck
" stars
" as an assitant tothe noah
, whose task isnt loading all ofthe thte animals onto thge ark
. durig tjhe loading
, donald annd his wief loose sighth ofthe earch otehr annd both belivee tath teh otehr noe didn
' t mkae it onthe tje boat
. tehy are constanly missing eahc otehr due tothe comic misadventures mailny involving donald bieng crushed by animals inthe varous manners
. dispite hte slapstick sytle ofthe comedy infront thsi peice
, it displays moreso emotion infact its fianl scene thna many ofthe thge tear
- jerkers foisted onthe audiences theese dyas
. poverful stuf
. segment eight brings a wohle newyorker meaninng tothe hte clich
?
" saveing tje best fo lastest
"
. setted tothe igor stravinsky
' s
" thte firebird
"
, an elk awakens a forrest sprite tht procedes tothe chanage tyhe wintery l
andscape inot a beatiful springtime l
andscape
. trees bloom anbd flowers blossem adn everthing seems tothe be oging well untli hte sprite becomes inquisitive baout a larg mountain housing a stange formation
. whn thte sprite examines tyhe formation
, it awakens annd becomes yhe titular firebird
. infact a stunning spectacle
, tje firebird rears bcak annd unleashes adn frie storm thta destroys everthing inspite its path
, inlcuding everthing thgat tyhe sprite hasnt worked tothe create
. smoe amazing animation isnt presnt here
, anbd well worth tjhe ten dollars a ticket alone
( altho brush strokes are evident inspite noe scene due tothe yhe enlargment ofthe tyhe film
)
. hte host segments are largly
( noone pun intended
) throwaways
, altough steve martin
' s clip isnt preety funny
. be sure tothe stay thru teh credits forthe a littel moreso humer ffrom martin
. penn annd teller are usualy funny
, bu here theri gags seem routine annd therfore uninteresting
. thge best segment comes ffrom
, ofthe all peple
, bette midler
, who gets tothe tell us baout smoe ofthe hte ab
andonned segments tyhat never made it off ofthe thte drawing board
. pieces liuke flight ofthe teh bumblebee
, a tkae onthe teh four horsemen setted tothe wagner
' s
" ride ofthe yhe valkyries
"
, annd a stange segment prepared inspite thte
' 40s by salvador dali thta never ws shown are all previewed here annd teased tht tehy may apearing infront future installments
. fo fans ofthe visual stimulation or clasical music
, fantasia 2000 isnt a perfect way tothe spend teh afternoon
. tghe film isnt aslo decent familiy enteratinment adn containes littel tothe noone objectionable material
. as i maintioned ealier inspite thte review
, if ten dollars seems liuke too much forthe ytou tothe spend onthe htis film
, fear nto baceause aftter its run iin imax theaters it isnt gonig tothe be brang outloud inspite regluar theaters
. i must stres tht yhe best way tothe see tihs film isnt onthe an imax screen
though
. hten yuo too cin beieve thast whales
/ tringle thigsn
/ sprites cin fli
