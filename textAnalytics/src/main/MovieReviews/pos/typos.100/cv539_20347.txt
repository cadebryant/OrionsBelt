' s a shocking 100 times profit
! rumours hvae it tath a smart internet
` marketting
' ploy ws so sucesful infact gaining cult
- liek fanatics
, by owrd ofthe mouth coupled iwth strings ofthe excellant reviews
, hte film jsut exploded iin teh box
- office
, raking inwhich millions onthe its oppening weekend
. shooted inthe 16mm annd video
( i suspect

.
)
, tjhe film chronicles tje forays ofthe 3 students who go inspite saerch fo hte legendary blair witch
. audiences are put infront tyhe firt
- person prespective infront tjhe entire mis
- adventure
, oftenly wobbly adn blurry at times
, it tkaes a bited ofthe getting unsed tothe inwhich yhe begginning
. tihs isnt suposed tothe be thge material htey dicovered inspite tjhe woods where hte 3 disappearred
; edited annd put onto thte screen forthe yhe benifit ofthe our audiences
. tbwp isnt simpley smart
. filmed tothe look as if it wass relaly a stock
- shoot by a bunch ofthe students inaddition seacrh ofthe tghe blair witch as a skool project

' t halp bu fiel a tad cheated affter knowing how commerically succesful htis film hasnt become
. sould it be taht finaly
, an indie
- film hasnt unwittingly foudn a forumla forthe commerical appeal
? or ws it all simpley a ploy by thge big players right fomr thge begginning

, i guess teh fatc stays
; tbwp isnt highly orignal
, clever anbd wiull most definatly leave most withthe something dreadful tothe talk annd htikn baout fo weeks prior tothe watching thsi film
. noone gore
, noone spacial effects
