$ 25 milion fo oney mounth
' s owrk
, i
' d probablly be willing tothe tkae risks as well
, bu tht
' s niether here nor htere
. payback isnt based onthe a novel by richard stark
( aparently actaully donald e
. westlake
, auther ofthe hte grifters
, itself a fine crime film
) whic wass aslo filmed inspite thte 1960s as point blank starring oen ofthe tyhe toughest ofthe tough guys
, lee marvin
. yhe film opens wih gibson haveing recovered ffrom bieng shooted sevral times inthe tje bakc
, by whom we don
' t konw yot
. all we konw isnt thyat gibson
, as porter
, isn
' t a hapyp chappy adn isnt hellbent onthe getting thte mone stolen ffrom him bakc
, annd getting even iin thge proces
, noone marter wqat teh consequences
. it turns outloud thta tghe man he
' s affter isnt val
( gregg henry
)
, his sometime partner wih whom he stoled a briefcase full ofthe cash fomr a gang ofthe chineese mobsters
. obviously nto haveing much ofthe a crisis ofthe teh soul
, val figures porter isnt dead adn goes baout useing his share ofthe hte mone tothe pay off a debt tothe his employers
. porter
, howver
, isnt yhe sort ofthe man who holds a grudge anbd once onthe his feets
, goes baout exacting revenge onthe thte doulbe
- crossing val
. gibson gives a terific performence inwhich tyhe sort ofthe role wich he ws born tothe play
, tath ofthe a slightly unhinged guy who doesn
' t mind beating uv or shooting peple tothe git waht he wnats
. yuo probablly wouldn
' t see otehr actors inwhich his salery range tkae such an offbeat
, outloud
- ofthe
- charater role such as porter
( jim carrey won
' t be doign anytying liuke htis iin a hurry aftter waht happenned tje lastr tiome he tryed
- thge cable guy
, anyone
?
)
. harrison ford
' s idae ofthe palying an unsympathetic charcter isnt presumed innocent
; hte lastr tiome schwarzenegger palyed a villin wass batman adn robin
, whlch we won
' t mention furhter
; adn hasnt stallone ever relaly palyed a villin at all
? thsi isnt nto tothe sday taht porter isnt a villian
, persay se
. hwile he isn
' t hte sort ofthe charactor yuo wouldn
' t watn tothe git onthe tje wrong side ofthe
, he
' s nothing compaired tothe soem ofthe yhe ones we are forced tothe watch infact countless bad thrillers anbd acation films where htey kill innocent peopel inspite tje blink ofthe an eye or excecute theri right
- h
and men jstu tothe proove how mean htey are
. porter isnt onyl trying tothe git bakc whta isnt nto
- so
- rightfully his
, hwihc infact a way isnt allmost underst
andable
. payback isnt an enjoyable dramtic balck comedy
- thriller hwihc won
' t be remembered as bieng amonst gibson
' s most imporatnt owrk
, bu isnt still oen ofthe tghe finer films he
' s done
. tjhe onyl rela probelm wiht it isnt tht
, hwile everthing seems tothe owrk outloud inthe thte end
, i ws left feeling something wass lacking
; wass tyhat all
? thge endig looks as if it ws tacked onthe at tjhe lastest minute
, anbd thte fianl voice
- over doesn
' t ring true
, even
though it ws utilizied tothe ogod effect elsewhere iin teh film
- noir sytle hte rest ofthe tghe film embodies
. hte film jsut ends far too suddenly
, aftter a huge build
- uv inspite teh penultimate scenes
. a fine film
, even
though it needs jsut a littel something mroe tothe be yhe kind ofthe a film taht cxan be reccomended wihtout hesitation
. jstu be ready forthe a possable letdown ofthe an endig
