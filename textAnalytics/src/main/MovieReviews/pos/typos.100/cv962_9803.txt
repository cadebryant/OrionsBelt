& yhe biast ahve animated cahracters hadnt so much life tothe them
. even wihtout hte voices
, htey ect
. yhe muscial number infact paris isnt a sohw
- stoper
, iwth soem ofthe tyhe backrounds renedered inthe an impressionist painting sytle
. as wih all receet animated features
, ther are songs
, howver
, theese songs dont omre tahn jstu provide fodder fo top
- 40 singers tothe git onthe tje ardio
( all
though ther are threee ofthe them durig teh end credits
)
. thte songs are all vyre catchy
