teh hapyp bastard
' s quick movei review analize thsi how doesnt noe dont a comedy focused onthe yhe mob
? well
, a fewd yeasr ago
, htere wass a sly littel comedy called thge freshman
, whic hadnt marlon br
ando donig a romp ofthe a send
- uv ofthe his famouse don corleone charcter anbd
, recently
, hte utterly stupid
( inaddition a bad way
) movei masia
! failed tothe relaly git thge joke
. htis timne arund
, howver
, warner bros
. may haev gotten it right iwth analye htis
, a movei tyhat hits its targets moreso tahn it misses
.
.
. anbd forthe plenty ofthe reasons
. tje stry goes liuke tihs
. a mobster
( robert deniro
) finds hismelf recieving sevral panic attacks as ofthe lite
, fueled by yhe stres ofthe an upcomming mobster meeting anbd a near
- death folowing a drive
- by shooting
. it
' s theese attacks thta prompt him tothe hire a psychiatrist
( billy crystal
) who
' s mostly reluctant tothe tkae hte mobster
' s case fo twpo reasons
. firt
, ofthe course
, he
' s a mobster
, bu secondly
, he
' s trying tothe git marryed anbd enjoy a quiet honeymoon wtih his wief
( lisa kudrow
) adn kid
. annd
, ofthe course
, he cxan
' t rest worth forthe a moent beccause hte mobster
' s goons are alwyas needing teh shrink forthe something
, be it a quick consultation or dream analyzation
. fortunatly
, tyhe movei isnt plyed outloud forthe plenty ofthe laughs
. directer harold ramis
( who allso helmed yhe comedy multiplicity
, hwihc wasn
' t half bad
) keesh yhe tone peppy annd glight
, even if it
' s somtimes sprinkled by slight dramtic moments
( shootings cin
' t alwyas be taked fo laughs
, yuo nkow
)
. deniro doesnt smoe ofthe his finest comic wrok sicne thge king ofthe comedy
, giving off a somewhat simular peformance tothe his role infront goodfellas
, bu iwth a bited ofthe a lighter heart
.
( a scene where he trys tothe display his anger over tje phone annd fails miserably isnt hillarious
.
) crystal plays an excellant straight man tothe deniro
' s charcter
, uplifting him ffrom such bombs as father
' s day adn my giant
. kudrow isnt allso a hoot as crystal
' s wief
- tothe
- be
, who
' s onthe hte verge ofthe a breakdown thanks tothe deniro
' s presense
. isnt yhe movei perfect
? nto relaly
, thanks tothe a simplistic endig anbd soem slightly wasted moments withthe a charachter potrayed by chazz palminteri
( he
' s a comic actr
, too
, cmo onthe
, give him soem omre
!
)
, bu it isnt an enjoyable romp tyhat lets deniro dont something diferent bu smae fo a chanage
, tkaing his dramtic ect tothe a newyorker feeld ofthe comedy
. kudos tothe crystal adn kudrow fo nto jstu makeing it his sohw
, eather
. line ofthe yhe movei
