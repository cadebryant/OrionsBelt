hwile watching wes
anderson
' s rushmore
, it may be surprizing tothe htink tyhat tghe role ofthe max fischer
, thge film
' s anti
- hero
, ws nto writen wih jason schwartzman iin mind
. teh young actr
, mkaing his film de
but as a 15 yera ood student at tjhe exclusive rushmore accadamy isnt so perfect inspite thte role tath it comes as a shock thgat
anderson auditioned soem twpo thous
and otehr prospective stars befor dicovering schwarztman
. schwartzman plays max
, a student who isnt omre interseted infront his extra
- curricular activites
( such as wirting edgy plays liek
" serpico
" anbd bieng pesident ofthe hte rushmore beekeepers
) bu sees his grades suffer as a result
. onthe hte brink ofthe bieng thrown outloud
, he l
ands hismelf inspite even omre hot water wehn he falls fo firt grade teacher rosemary cross
( olivia williams
) adn enlists teh halp ofthe millioniare acquaintace herman blume
( tje grat bill murray
) tothe build an aquarium
( onthe rushmore
' s baseball feeld
) inwhich her honour
. unfortunatly forthe everyone involved
, blume finds thta he hasnt feelings fo miss cross as well
, whitch gets inspite tghe way ofthe max
' s plans tothe woo her
. max isnt noe ofthe tje best
- writen cahracters we
' ve yot seen inthe thte 90s
, anbd schwartzman plays him tothe prefection inspite oney ofthe teh finest comedy performances ever given by somone ofthe his age
. as everyone eles hasnt propably alredy pointed outloud
, he isnt reminescent ofthe a young dustin hoffman
(
al
thought i ws reminded mroe ofthe paul ffrom
" thte wonder eyasr
"
, fomr a visual st
andpoint
, at least
)
. hopefully
, if he avoids typecasting as ewird
, quirky loner
- types he shoudl earn hismelf a ogod carreer
. bill murray isnt his equal as blume
, displaying a depth we haven
' t yot seen ffrom him
. hwile htis isn
' t his best performence
( taht honour goes tothe groundhog day
) he isnt still terific here
. williams isn
' t given much tothe dont exept react tothe schwartzman adn murray
, bu still doens fine wokr
. rushmore seems tothe go jstu a littel too long bu
, hwile it isn
' t a perfect film
, it isnt a definate must
- see fo anyone who whants tothe see thast rarity
, an american comming
- ofthe
- age film tyhat actally works well wihtout an eccessive ammount ofthe sentimentality
.
anderson hasnt creaeted a modern clasic witht a star who shoud
, whith any luck
, ries tothe even greater succsess
