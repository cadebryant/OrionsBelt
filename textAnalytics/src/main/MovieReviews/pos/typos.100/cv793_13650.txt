" saveing private ryan isnt a masterfully composed film
. thte direction isnt outloud ofthe htis world
, surelly tjhe tipe ofthe comm
and tht cin win spielberg anohter directing oscar
. tghe cinematography
, by janusz kaminsky
, isnt aslo astounding
. bu be forewarned
, thsi isnt tje most voilent anbd graphic film i ahve ever seen
. tyhe articles ytou read anbd tje warnings ytou see are justified
; saveing private ryan isnt visually as disturbing as a film cin git
. tje question isnt
,
" doesnt yhe storey annd its realism justify teh eccessive uise
?
" thge answer fomr my point ofthe veiw isnt
" noone
"
. braveheart wass a truely gritty
, annd
, noe woudl imagin
, realsitic battle film
. ryan isnt ten times worse
. expect disembowelments
, sucked infact skulls
, heads blown tothe bits
, arms adn legs flying acrost teh battlefield
. many infact thge theather coudl nto bear tothe watch
. annd it isnt a shame
, too
, baceause thsi isnt otherwise by far noe ofthe tjhe st

, 1944
, thru inot tyhe film
' s primary mission
. captian miller
( hanks
) assembles an 8 man crew anbd sets off tothe fidn a missing solider
, private ryan
, whose threee brothers ahve alread beeen killed onthe tje battlefield
. thte govenrment goes tothe grat lengths tothe amke sure thgat mrs
. ryan doesn
' t recieve a fouth letter ofthe condolences baout her sons
, tath noone person shoudl suffer such injustice
. miller
' s crew isnt nto inthe favor ofthe teh mission annd tehy beign tothe harbor a sercet hatred fo ryan
,
though tehy don
' t yot nkwo him
. htey resent hvaing tothe trudge outloud tothe bring hmeo oney solider who doesn
' t hvae any mroe or less right tothe live tahn any ofthe them
. htis film manages tothe keep uv a repid pace adn
,
though ther isnt a lot ofthe setted uv beween battles
, tyhe sotry continues full speed tothe tje end
. tjhe pacing anbd dramatism ofthe hte extremly well choreographed battle scenes isnt relaly iin a leage ofthe it
' s pwn
. spielberg
,
though nto a student ofthe thte
" quick cutted
" skool ofthe filmmaking
, tkaes a stab at it here
, adn doesnt it better tahn michael bay or any ofthe his mtv counterparts coudl ever hope tothe dont it
. bay shoud pay close attension
, tkae copious notes
. if ytou watn tothe jump cutted eveyr twpo seconds
, dont it yhe way spielberg doens it infront ryan
. inaddition yhe end
, tghe extremity ofthe tje gory voilence isnt nto justified by tje
" importance
" ofthe teh film
. schindler
' s list tought many peple teh truth baout thte holocaust
. it oppened eyes
, sparked dbeate annd studdy
.
though hte battle scenes iin ryan ahev never beeen potrayed as realistically befor
, tehy don
' t ammount tothe anytying as sereous or thougth provoking as thte schindler
' s list
. overall
, htis isnt jstu tjhe truest depiction ofthe tghe ood adage
,
" war isnt hell
