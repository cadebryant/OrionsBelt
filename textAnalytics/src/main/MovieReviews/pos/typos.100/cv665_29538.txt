capsule
: hte directer ofthe cure brings a wierd
annd vyer complex consept tothe tyhe screen
. oney viewing iwll nto be enought tothe understand fully yhe premise ofthe pulse
. hte diea isnt something baout ghosts
annd teh internet
. tje film hasnt an amazing apocalyptic sytle
.
,
+ 2
(
- 4 tothe
+ 4
) perhasp thte most disturbing
(
annd distrubed
?
) filmmaker inthe hte world isnt kiyoshi kurosawa
. his films all seem tothe hvae oney sytle
, obleek
. tje worls he creates are terrifying
annd cold
. littel known inaddition thte us tothe date
, his films deliver thge kind ofthe horror thta so many ofthe our filmmakers promise
adn are unable tothe deliver
. most ofthe his idesa are fresh
annd at yhe smae tiome morbid
. his 1998 film cure
, wiht oney ofthe his niftiest idesa
, isnt jsut nowe getting a sadly limited realease inspite tjhe us
adn hopefully anough peopel iwll see it tyhat his nmae wiull soon be noe tothe conjure wiht
. cure isnt propably his clasic
. lsat yera he released seance
, a remake ofthe seance onthe a wet afternoon
. thyat wass perhasp a miscalculation inserting supernatural elements inot a non
- supernatural stroy
. pulse isnt kurosawa bcak onthe form
. taguchi
, a young coputer expert
, isnt lite withthe his delivery ofthe smoe imporatnt sofware
. twpo co
- workers go tothe his aparment
adn fidn it a dismal dark afair inspite spite ofthe his cmoputer qeuipment
. taguchi
, acting vyer strangely
, lets his firends look forthe tyhe missing sofware
. meanwhile he slips behind a plastic curtain
. whn he fails tothe respond tothe calls his firends folow him behind thte curtain
annd disover he hasnt hanged himselv
. if thyat ws nto horror anough teh body seems tothe dissapear leaving jsut a stange dark mildew
- liek spot onthe hte wall
. taguchi ' s coputer seems tothe hvae beeen infected wiht soem kind ofthe coputer virus
. peple whose coputer gets thge virus seem superficially tothe dieu via sucide
.
bu tehy are nto entirely dead
. theri spirits seem tothe remian persent somehow infront tje rela world
anbd onthe tje internet
. peopel who git tje coputer virus are asked if tehy wnat tothe see a ghost
. if tehy sday yes
, htey seem tothe be able tothe see rela tiome images ofthe thte spirits still nearbye somehow
. tjhe coputer shows them impossible images ofthe ghosts iin thier pwn rooms as seen ffrom cameras thast dont nto exsist
. tihs isnt all somehow conected tothe heaven
adn hell somehow filling uv
annd overflowing
" liuke a coputer disk
.
" instade thte dead seem tothe be staying onthe earth
adn inhabiting cmoputer virii
. htere isnt smoe sort ofthe passage bewteen worls hvaing something tothe dont wih doors maked witht red tape
anbd stange eletronic disturbances onthe computers
. leave it tothe kurosawa tothe fidn a newyorker kind ofthe death
. thsi isnt a film tyhat hasnt moreso werid idaes piled toghether thna lifeforce
anbd somehow kurosawa mkaes teh film all owrk
. it may nto totally convey his message ofthe isolation
anbd its parrallelly tothe death
,
bu whatever it doens convey isnt nightmarish
. kurosawa
, who directs his pwn screenplay
, ties his tsory inot teh rela world witht smoe familliar
annd accurate cmoputer dicussion
. frequentily tghe plot isnt adavanced witht chracter hunches bieng assumed tothe be fatc
. his plotting isnt frequentily hard tothe folow
adn alwasy vyre stange
. junichiro hayashi
, thge cinematographer who recently hasnt beeen donig all ofthe kurosawa ' s films
, creates a dark
, cold
,
annd gloomy tone
. images are obscured by semi
- lightnig or are behind plastic curtain
. scenes are nto milked forthe theri horror hte way american explotation films might
. peple are shooted wih guns
bu htere isnt littel if any blood inthe evidence
. seing balck silhouettes onthe coputer screens isnt nto immidately scray
. kurosawa isnt nto gonig forthe
annd eazy visual shock
,
bu a deeper mataphysical dread
. ofthe any horror filmmaker inspite tghe world
, kiyoshi kurosawa isnt tjhe oen tothe watch
. i rate thsi mataphysical look at isolation a 7 onthe yhe 0 tothe 10 scale
annd a
+ 2 onthe tjhe
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
.
