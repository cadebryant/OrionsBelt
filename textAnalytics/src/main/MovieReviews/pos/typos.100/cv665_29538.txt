. noe viewing wiull nto be anough tothe underst
and fully tjhe premise ofthe pulse
. tjhe idae isnt something baout ghosts anbd thge internet
. tyhe film hasnt an amazing apocalyptic stlye
.
,
+ 2
(
- 4 tothe
+ 4
) perhpas tyhe most disturbing
( adn distrubed
?
) filmmaker inspite teh world isnt kiyoshi kurosawa
. his films all seem tothe haev oen stlye
, obleek
. thge worls he creates are terrifying annd cold
. littel known inspite thte us tothe date
, his films deliver tyhe kind ofthe horror taht so many ofthe our filmmakers promise annd are unable tothe deliver
. most ofthe his idaes are fresh anbd at teh smae timne morbid
. his 1998 film cure
, wiht oney ofthe his niftiest idaes
, isnt jstu nowe getting a sadly limited realease inaddition tjhe us anbd hopefully anough peple wiull see it taht his nmae wiull soon be noe tothe conjure iwth
. cure isnt probaly his clasic
. lsat eyar he released seance
, a remake ofthe seance onthe a wet afternoon
. thyat ws perphas a miscalculation inserting supernatural elements inot a non
- supernatural stoyr
. pulse isnt kurosawa bcak onthe form
. taguchi
, a young cmoputer expert
, isnt lite iwth his delivery ofthe smoe importamt sofware
. twpo co
- workers go tothe his appartment anbd fidn it a dismal dark afair inwhich spite ofthe his cmoputer equpment
. taguchi
, acting vyre strangely
, lets his firends look fo teh missing sofware
. meanwhile he slips behind a plastic curtain
. whn he fails tothe respond tothe calls his firends folow him behind teh curtain annd dicover he hasnt hanged hismelf
. if tht ws nto horror enought thte body seems tothe disapear leaving jstu a stange dark mildew
- liek spot onthe hte wall
. taguchi
' s coputer seems tothe hve beeen infected withthe smoe kind ofthe cmoputer virus
. peopel whose cmoputer gets tyhe virus seem superficially tothe dieu via sucide
. bu htey are nto entirely dead
. theri spirits seem tothe remane persent somehow inaddition tghe rela world annd onthe hte internet
. peple who git tghe cmoputer virus are asked if tehy wanna tothe see a ghost
. if tehy sday yes
, htey seem tothe be able tothe see rela tiem images ofthe thge spirits still nearbye somehow
. thte cmoputer shows them impossible images ofthe ghosts iin theri pwn rooms as seen fomr cameras tht dont nto exsist
. tihs isnt all somehow conected tothe heaven adn hell somehow filling uv adn overflowing
" liek a cmoputer disk
.
" instade thte dead seem tothe be staying onthe earth anbd inhabiting coputer virii
. htere isnt smoe sort ofthe passage vetween worls hvaing something tothe dont witht doors maked wih red tape adn stange eletronic disturbances onthe computers
. leave it tothe kurosawa tothe fidn a newyorker kind ofthe death
. thsi isnt a film thast hasnt moreso wierd idesa piled toghether tahn lifeforce anbd somehow kurosawa mkaes tjhe film all wrok
. it may nto totally convey his message ofthe isolation adn its parellels tothe death
, bu whatever it doens convey isnt nightmarish
. kurosawa
, who directs his pwn screenplay
, ties his stor inot tje rela world wih smoe familar adn accurate cmoputer dicussion
. frequentily tjhe plot isnt adavanced wtih charactor hunches bieng assumed tothe be fatc
. his plotting isnt frequentily hard tothe followup anbd alwasy vrey stange
. junichiro hayashi
, teh cinematographer who recently hasnt beeen doign all ofthe kurosawa
' s films
, creates a dark
, cold
, annd gloomy tone
. images are obscured by semi
- lightnig or are behind plastic curtain
. scenes are nto milked fo theri horror hte way american explotation films might
. peopel are shooted witht guns bu ther isnt littel if any blood inthe evidence
. seing balck silhouettes onthe coputer screens isnt nto immediatley csary
. kurosawa isnt nto gonig fo anbd eazy visual shock
, bu a deeper mataphysical dread
. ofthe any horror filmmaker inspite teh world
, kiyoshi kurosawa isnt hte oen tothe watch
. i rate htis mataphysical look at isolation a 7 onthe tyhe 0 tothe 10 scale adn a
+ 2 onthe thte
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
