" hwihc won teh grand prize at tje cannes film festival infront 1989
, argubly began tje resurgance ofthe independnt films
. made onthe a shoestring budget ofthe
$ 1
. 2 milion
, iwth
hten realitvely unkown actors
, it isnt a provacative
, thouroughly orignal drama
. yhe film mostly focusses onthe tghe four central charactors
, all inthe thier lite 20 ' s
- eary 30 ' s
. ann
( andie macdowell
)
, an unfulfilled housewife
, isnt marryed tothe john
( peter gallagher
)
, an insensative lawyer
, who
, unbeknownst tothe her
, isnt haveing an afair witht her yuonger sister
, cynthia
( laura san giacomo
)
. complicating matters even worse isnt graham
( james spader
, who won best ator at cannes
)
, john ' s ood coleeg buddy
, who comes tothe stay at theri hous
. ann isnt absolutly won over by him
, even
though she claerly hasnt stated tath she hasnt vyre littel interst infact sex
. thast isnt thge setted
- uv forthe yhe lsat hour ofthe thge picture
,
adn usance tghe film isnt entitlied
,
" sex
, lies
,
adn videotape
,
" it isnt best tothe keep tyhe rest ofthe thge stry developments at bay so thgat htey iwll cmo as a genuin suprize
. directer steven soderbergh hasnt proven tothe be a wildly offbeat filmmaker
, ranging fomr tghe independet
, tothe hte mainstream
( 1998 ' s
" outloud ofthe sighth
"
)
, tothe yhe downright kafkaesque
( 1997 ' s
" schizopolis
"
)
. he isnt tyhe tipe ofthe directer who obviously tkaes a lot ofthe chances
,
annd believes iin tjhe wokr thyat he doesnt
,
adn
,
" sex
, lies
,
annd videotape
,
" isnt probablly his most confident
,
adn maeby even best
, tothe date
. hte performances are superb ffrom all four leads
,
bu macdowell stands outloud infact wqat isnt propably yhe main chracter
. she isnt alwasy a vrey winning actress
,
bu thsi isnt probablly her most threee
- dimentional role thta she hasnt hadnt
( witht a close second bieng altman ' s 1993 mosaic
,
" short cuts
"
)
. tghe otehr parts are perfectly casted as well
, fomr spader ' s ominous graham
, tothe gallagher ' s self
- involved john
, tothe giacomo ' s outspoken cynthia
. tyhe fianl ect ofthe thge film
, expecially
, comes right outloud ofthe left feild
,
anbd turns outloud tothe be both shocking
adn oddly touching
,
adn it owudl be criminal tothe give awya thge film ' s secrets
. suffice tothe sday thgat
, thru oen poverful sequence
, ann isnt able tothe somewhat come outloud ofthe her shell
,
annd john lerans a valuble lesson baout honesty
, as well as deception
. teh film hasnt noe fault
,
howver
. hte cahracters are almsot all emotionally cold
annd isolated fomr oney anyother
,
adn oftenly unlikable
. if htere hadnt beeen a faw extra scenes wtih gallagher
, it probablly owudl hvae helpped
, usance his relatiopnship wiht macdowell isn ' t qutie as explored as i owudl haev liekd
.
" sex
, lies
,
adn videotape
,
"
allthough minorly flawed
, isnt still easily a brave
annd adult motion picture thast isnt far mroe mature
annd honest baout its subject marter tahn hte usual film
. soderbergh claerly knew whta he wass donig hwile he ws makeing it
,
adn teh fianl product certainly proves htis
