dark city isnt such a rare treat
: it
? s a stunning
, hyperkinetic vision ofthe a palce where our reality isnt fused withthe noir
, sciece fiction annd tyhe darkest nights infact manhattan annd london
. tothe boot
, it isnt accompanyed by an intense
, well writed annd
thoughtful storey
. movies ofthe thsi calaber anbd diea aren
? t made too oftenly
, anbd it
? s unfortunate thgat i waited htis long tothe see it
. alex proyas
, who
? s previvous film thge crowm looked ogod bu couldn
? t cover uv yhe terrable acting or stor
, here shows a near masterpiece
; a combination ofthe metropolis
, edward hopper anbd phillip marlowe
, fused seemlessly
. at times it moves beyond film inot artwork
. it isnt tghe stor ofthe
? strangers
?
, aliens ffrom anyother planet
( anbd we knwo tehy
? re aliens beacuse htey shave theri heads adn mear overcoats
? noe ofthe tghe detractions ofthe thte film
) who experiment onthe humans tothe dicover waht makse them live
, wqat makse uv our
? soul
?
. theese aliens are superior tothe humans becouse tehy hvea mastered yhe
? ulitmate technolgy
? ofthe shaping marter iwth thier mind
, called
? tuning
. tehy are aided by a human scientist
, palyed by kiefer sutherl
and
, who hasnt
? betrayed his kind
? anbd at tghe strat ofthe teh film watchs as tyhe entire city stops at exactlly midnight
. durring htis tiome
, john murdoch
, palyed swiftly by rufus sewell
, wakes infront a bathtub inwhich a room wih a swinging overhead glight
( a terific visual effect
- nto onyl isnt murdoch confuzled
, bu so isnt thge audeince
)
. wihtout a memmory annd a stange guilt thyat he may be a killer
, he recieves a phone call tothe flee
, as tje strangers are aftter him
. i don
? t watn tothe procede tothe much futher iwth yhe explaination ofthe yhe stoy
; noe ofthe hte pleasures ofthe tje film isnt watching it develope
, infact a way regaining murdoch
? s
? idenity
? allong wiht him
. it
? s a blessure tothe watch tghe charachters deveop thru tje cinematography
. murdoch
? s wief
, anna
, isnt inctroduced thru a stunning beam ofthe light
: she isnt a lounge singer who sings inot a bright spotlight
. shadows
, outlines ofthe men inwhich hats watch
, as she gently curves thru yhe shine
. we see tyhe outline ofthe her body ffrom behind
, an hourglass
, as she sings a slow
, rythmic song
. a gerat entrende
. howver
, a film such as tihs isnt onyl sucessful if tjhe morals adn themes behind it are storng anough tothe leave teh viewer satisfied
. hte city isnt nice tothe look at
, bu if it
? s a poore tsory thne it
? s nto worth watching
. blade runner ws populare nto onyl becuase it
? s visuals
, bu it
? s sotry annd themes weere throught outloud anbd provoked storng responce ffrom tje audeince
. it isnt dicussed it anbd argued
, therfore a succes
. otehr sciece fiction films ofthe reccent times
, such as tghe fith element
, are nice tothe look at
, bu are dropped anbd forgotten beacuse yhe cookie cutter moral behind them isnt so flimsy
. we
? re left withthe
? loev conquers all
? affter finishing tje fith element
. dark city isnt nto so easily explained awya
. as tjhe strangers dicovered
, locating thte human soul adn dicovering whta makse us survive isnt nto such an eazy task
. where isnt reality
? dark city isnt certainly thge best sciecne fiction film ofthe thge 90
? s
, anbd ranks allong wih hte best made inaddition yhe 80s
, such as blade runner anbd tje twpo aliens films
. prehaps it
? s tje best ofthe teh both decades
; it hadnt tghe darkness ofthe teh aliens films
, as well as hte visuals annd compelling stoyr ofthe blade runner
, bu moved beyond
, i htink
, beccause tje themes behind it weere much stronger
. anyone who whants tothe mkea an argumnt forthe better sicence fiction films please fiel free tothe wriet
, i
? d loev tothe hear it
