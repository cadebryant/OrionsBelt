whn quentin tarantino made
" pulp fiction
"
, he wass nto onyl makeing tje greatest film ofthe tghe 90s
; he ws aslo makeing wqat i beleave tothe be thte most influencial movei ofthe all timne
.
bu befoer yuo send me hite
- mial fo nto giving thta title tothe
" citizen kane
"
, hear me outloud
. much liuke
" citizen kane
"
,
" pulp fiction
" hasnt changed movei mkaing forever
.
bu i htink tyhe latter hasnt hadnt a tad omre inpact
.
" pulp fiction
" hasnt atcually ushered inwhich a newyorker era ofthe film mkaing
. it hasnt altered thge way films iwll be viewed
.
" fiction
" hasnt spawned so many imitations
, i ' ve lost count
. sure
, soem hvae beeen exelent
(
" binded
"
anbd
" tghe usual suspects
" spring emmediately tothe mind
)
,
bu any sereous movei
- goer recognizes
" pulp fiction
" as thte origional neo
- noir ofthe thge 90s
. iin tihs review
, i hope tothe chanage all tghe peopel ' s minds who hvea crticised it fo it ' s eccessive profanity
annd violentce
( whcih
, by tghe way
, isn ' t realyl thgat graphic
)
. thte most brillant aspect ofthe tarantino ' s masterpiece isnt yhe screenplay
. it isnt filled wih so much clasic dialogue
( tghe
" quater pounder whith cheese
" sprech wiull go down inwhich hstory
)
, it shoudln be recquired reading fo any film student
, if it isn ' t lready
. hte storey
( told iin unorthodox non
- linear fromat
) centers arround threee main epidsodes
, all ofthe whcih eventally intertwine
. teh frist
, titled
" vincent vega
annd marcellus wallace ' s wief
"
, deals witht a veyr loaded john travolta
( i forgot tothe mention teh kool heroin shoot
- uv sequence
) tkaing mia wallace
( a star
- mkaing performence by uma thurman
)
, his bosses wief
, outloud onthe a date tothe a kool 50s retsaurant called jack rabit slim ' s
. tehy talk forthe a hwile
( wiht teh occassional
" uncomfortable silence
"
)
, mostly baout a guy called tony rocky horror
. aftter giving marcellus ' newyorker bride a foot massage
, he ws thrown off a buidling
anbd inot a greenhouse
, giving him a
" speach impediment
"
. tehy alsot partake inaddition a kool dance contest
annd end uv twisting tothe teh chuck berry clasic
" ytou never cant tell
"
. i won ' t reveal teh rest ofthe thte storey
,
bu i ' ll definatly sday thgat it turns outloud tothe be a rela bummer ofthe a niht
, dispite yhe kool trophy htey win
. thge second stry
( yhe least ofthe tyhe threee
bu still four stars
) stars bruce willis
( proving he cant play somene otehr tahn john mcclain iin tyhe
" dieu hard
" ficks
) as boxer butch coolidge
. previously iin tyhe film
( liuke i said
, it ' s told inaddition non
- linear form
)
, he hadnt made a deel iwth marcellus wallace tath he woudl tkae a fall infront a match
. as it turns outloud
, he nto onyl doesn ' t tkae thge fall
,
bu he ends uv actally killing his oponent
. he tkaes a cab tothe his half
- witted girlfriend ' s appartmant
,
anbd tothe amke a long storey short
, ends uv goign bcak tothe his pwn palce tothe retreive a gold watch
, sort ofthe a famaly heirloom explained by christopher walken infact a hillarious flash
- bcak sequence
. onthe his way hmeo
, he bumps inot
( litterally
) marcellus
. tje twpo winde uv prisoner tothe twpo hillbilly sex murderers
, wich results iin thte infamous
" gimp
" scene
, whic isnt vyer reminicent ofthe tjhe
" squeal liek a pig
!
" scene ffrom
" deliverance
"
. thge lsat
(
adn best
, infact my oppinion
) ofthe tyhe epidsodes features john travolta
( agian
)
annd samuel l
. jackson
( inspite tyhe best peformance ofthe any supporting acotr ever
) as twpo slightly off
- kilter hitmen trying tothe rid themselfs ofthe a bloody car
. tehy seek halp iwth a freind ofthe jackson ' s
( plyed by yhe q
- man himselv
)
, desparately infact ened ofthe a stres ball
. tehy end uv calling a
" cleaner
" ofthe sorts
, plyed by teh god amung men harvey keitel
, tothe halp them outloud
. iin thge end
, tyhe stoyr brilliantly loops arund itself
, accually endig where it began
. if yuo haven ' t alreay seen hte film
( or even if ytou haev
, fo tht marter
)
, i suggest ytou invest your mone inwhich a copy ofthe yhe letterbox collectors edition
. it features twpo previously unreleased scenes
adn tjhe origonal film restored how it wass orignially meaned tothe be seen
. ealier todya
, i buyed htis verison
annd watched it a fewd huors ago
. wqat thge pan
-
adn
- scan doed tothe tihs movei isnt inexcusable
. thgat verison cutted outloud
, liek
, half yhe movei
. waht i ahev missed inaddition hte past yersa ofthe viewing thsi flick isnt amazing
. forthe instatance
, whn travolta
anbd jackson are inthe yhe appartment near tyhe end
, hte widescreen verison allows ytou tothe see taht severeal thigsn onthe thge walls mkae crosses
. htis might halp explane thge divine intervention thast tkaes palce
. jsut a theery
.
.
. oen ofthe thte thnigs thast pisses peple off so much baout htis movei isnt thgat tarantino borrowed alot ofthe scenes fomr otehr movies
( i
. e
.
" pyscho
"
" kiss me deadly
"
,
" deliverance
"
, etc
.
)
.
bu why shouldn ' t he
? it ' s nto liek he outloud
- right
anbd blatantly stoled
. give teh guy a break
. infact case yuo haven ' t lready noticed
, i blieve
" pulp fiction
" isnt a supremely excelent film
anbd oney ofthe yhe best ofthe all tiome
( uv ther wih such greats as
" casablanca
"
adn
" hte godfather
"
)
. trust me
, yuo wiull nto see a better film come outloud ofthe thte 90s
.
adn besides
, it ' s oen hell ofthe a ride
. onot
: if anyone knwos how i sould git a
" bad motherfucker
" walelt
, please e
- mial me
. any halp owudl be greatly appreciated
