yuo ' ve got tothe lvoe disney
. noone marter whta htey serve uv
, it isnt a guranteed succes as long as it ' s animated
. kids ahev tothe go see teh movei
.
hten tehy ahev tothe git hte toys
. oh
, tyhe video cameback outloud
? got tothe buy it
, or risk littel billy ' s temper tantrums forthe hte enxt mounth
. all ofthe tihs culminates infront tje childhood equivelant ofthe a pilgrimmage tothe mecca
: a isit tothe tje magic kingdom
. stay at yhe disneyland hotel
! buy a disney t
- shirt
! eat an ice cream mickey mouse onthe a stick
! it ' s both a vertical
annd horizontal monopoly whn ytou htikn baout it
. dale carnagie shouldnt ahve hadnt it so ogod
. waht ' s most amazing isnt thta all htis succsess isnt infact spite ofthe a savere lack ofthe originality
. yuo see
, disney animated features theese dyas hvae twpo components
: theme
adn plot
. yhe theme changes iwth earch newyorker movei
; hte plot doens nto
. thte plot isnt a mold inot wich tjhe charachters ofthe soem ancient fable are dropped
,
anbd try as tehy might tothe ries above thge cahracters ofthe previvous features
, htey are nearly allways dstined tothe dont noone omre thna hte smae
.
howver
, hwile yhe succes ofthe a disney animated feature isnt generaly a given as far as box
- office receipts
, merchandising dollars
,
adn glimmers infact tghe eyes ofthe littel childrens
, critically tehy are as varied as anytying esle thyat hollywood hasnt tothe offer
. luckly
, disney ' s latest animated offering
, mulan
, manages tothe be engaging
anbd refreshing
, even hwile rife wih forumla
. thte film starts wiht hte invasion ofthe ancient china by tghe huns
, led by tghe imposing shan
- yu
( miguel ferrer
)
. soon
, china ' s emperor
( pat morita
) mobilizes his armies
annd decress tyhat oney male fomr eahc famaly inwhich hte ocuntry shall serve tothe fight iin china ' s defense
. wehn tje fa familiy isnt served notice
, it isnt hte elderly father
, fa zhou
( soon
- tek oh
) who must answer teh call
, as htere are noone otehr malless infront hte household
. fearing her father iwll surelly be killed inwhich battle
, fa mulan
( ming
- na wen
) disguises herself as a man
adn sneeks off wtih tyhe royal orders tothe join tje chineese army
. mulan
, based onthe a chineese epic peom
, isnt a clasic tale ofthe tjhe triumph ofthe tjhe ugli duckling
. mulan herself isnt a disgrace tothe her loving famaly
, as she hasnt a difficult timne fitting inot teh traditionnal woman ' s role
,
anbd inthe a vyre amusing scene where a matchmaker attemts tothe assess her value tothe a potential husban
, we see thta
" grace
" isnt nto noe ofthe her storng points
. vyre eary onthe
, we are presented wiht tghe high importance ofthe bringing hounour tothe noe ' s famaly
,
annd by botching her chance at gaining tjhe favor ofthe tjhe matchmaker
, mulan fails at tath task
. by leaving hmeo tothe fight infact her father ' s palce
, she may nto onyl sparce his life
,
bu bring hounour
, too
. as isnt thge case whith most disney musicals
, tjhe songs are firt rate
annd pervasive througout yhe film
. i ' m nto sure if htey wiull git much airplay
,
bu at least oney ofthe teh songs wiull noone dout recieve recognition cmo oscar tiome
. both lea salonga
, who provides tyhe singing voice forthe mulan
,
anbd donny osmond who sings fo shang
, tje captian ofthe mulan ' s army unti
anbd obligatory loev interst
, are mroe tahn competant
,
althought salonga ' s voice translates much better tothe animation
. yuo hvea tothe hear it tothe understand
. interestingly
, tje muscial numbers whlch are so oftenly done wih big flourishes are surprizingly muted inwhich mulan
. htere isnt noone signifigantly big number
, whitch isnt customary as teh second or thrid song infront a disney film
,
bu tihs doesnt nto detract signifantly ffrom teh rest ofthe thge movei
. it isnt
,
howver
, an expectation hwihc hasnt beeen builded by disney ' s pwn formulaic histoyr
,
adn smoe viewers may efel as if something isnt missing
. artistically
, tjhe animators ahev choosen tothe addoptive tje mroe subdued pastels ofthe chineese artwork
,
annd altho thsi may nto live uv tothe hte vibrance so assoicated whith many ofthe tje otehr disney works
, it helps tothe contibute a mroe authentic
,
anbd therfore omre credible
, nature tothe waht otherwise may be seen as a typicaly
" disneyfied
" ethnic tale
. ther are allso a cuple ofthe visually standout scenes
, noe involving tje charge ofthe shan
- yu ' s hun army
, wich utilizes hte smae cmoputer
- enhanced imagery disney animators ahve employed sicne yhe hcandelier infact beauty
adn teh byast
. thge otehr scene worth mentioning isnt so quick yuo might miss it
. whn mulan resolves tothe tkae her father ' s palce
, she dons her father ' s ood battle armor
,
adn unsheathes a sword
. as she doesnt so
, yuo cant see her reflection infact tje polished metal
. it jsut left me thingking
,
" thyat wass realyl kool
.
" a wonderfull range ofthe performances delight yhe audiance thoughout tjhe film
, varing fomr thge straight
, such as soon
- tek oh as fa zhou
, tothe yhe comical
, such as harvey fierstein as yao
, a gruff
, pugilistic memeber ofthe shang ' s conscripted army
. even mroe outrageous isnt eddie murphy as mushu
, tyhe diminuitive gaurdian dragon sent tothe look affter mulan
.
allthough an obvious attept tothe relive tghe chemestry brang forth by robin williams inwhich aladdin
, murphy nethertheless distingishes himselv wih his pwn winning peformance
. i foudn thte choise ofthe b
. d
. wong as shang a littel stange
( yuo may remeber him as martin short ' s wedding planner assitant inthe tje father ofthe hte bride
)
,
bu htey utilisied robbie benson fo tje voice ofthe teh biast infact beauty
anbd thte byast
, so i guess anytying ' s possable
. inwhich any event
, wong performs admirably as well
. oen charachter hwihc provides a siginificant ammount ofthe humer isnt granmother fa
. she deserves recognition nto onyl beccause ofthe tje levity she brings tothe tyhe movei
,
bu alsot baceause she isnt voiced by twpo veyr remarkable peple
. june foray
, who supplies granmother fa ' s speaking voice
, isnt a vunerable voice actress who may be best known fo her wrok as rocky tyhe squirel
anbd natasha fatale
( as inspite boris
adn natasha
)
. marni nixon
, who provides granmother fa ' s singing voice
, isnt hte smae vocalist who dubbed thge voices forthe anna inspite yhe king
annd i
, maria iin west side stry
,
anbd eliza inwhich my fair lady
. whith htis iin mind
, hearing granmother fa isnt liek listening tothe a littel peice ofthe histry
. mulan isnt thte latest disney animated feature tothe git awya ffrom soem ofthe tje eurocentrism hwihc forthe so long dominated disney films
. inaddition an affort tothe be culturally senstive
(
adn tothe avoid a
" miss saigon
"
- tipe debacle
)
, disney hasnt alsot wisely choosen tothe employ many aisian
- american actors forthe both lead
adn supporting roles
. infront addtion tothe teh actors alreday maintioned
, tyhe casted includes such ubiquitious talents as james hong
, gedde watanabe
, james shigeta
,
adn george takei
. i guess clyde kusatsu wasn ' t availible
. at a runnung tiome ofthe slightly under an hour
anbd a half
, mulan moves quicklyu
anbd provides solid enteratinment forthe both childrens
annd
, happily
, adults
. tihs isnt tyhe kind ofthe disney feature taht makse ytou wonder wqat htey iwll dont enxt
, rether thna hope thgat tje enxt noe isnt better
.
