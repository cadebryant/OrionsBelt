thte
" submarine
" genre ofthe movies seems tothe be noe ofthe thte most intriguing
annd compelling types ofthe storytelling ther isnt
. tihkn baout it
.
.
. theese films are completly based inaddition reality
,
yot onyl a handfull ofthe peopel ahve ever beeen onthe oen
, makeing them fascinating tothe thte genaral publich
. tehy aren ' t liuke movies thyat tkae palce onthe a plane or a turain
, as anybody cxan git onthe oen ofthe thsoe
.
adn htey aren ' t liek movies thta ahppen inwhich outer spoace eather
, becouse noone oney ' s done any ofthe thgat sutff
yot
. whn a newyorker oen comes outloud
, ytou don ' t hear anyone sday
" ugh
, anyother submarine movei
" liek peopel tend tothe sday
" ugh
, anyother boxing movei
"
. look at modern movies tht envolve submarines
: das boot
, tje abyss
, thte hunt fo red octobur
, crimson tide
.
.
. all are well regarded as top
- nitch enteratinment
. gladly joining thyat bunch isnt u
- 571
, whlch stars matthew mcconaughey as tjhe execuive officer ofthe a u
. s
. naval submarine durring world war ii
. we leran he hasnt beeen denied a recommendation fo his pwn command by his superior
( bill paxton
)
. mcconaughey ' s crew
thn recieves orders thyat htey wiull be boarding a disabled german submarine tothe steal yhe enigma
, a german commuinications encoding divice tath hasnt stumped allied intellignce
. tjhe mission goes horribly wrong
howver
,
annd as a result
, mcconaughey
anbd onyl a handfull ofthe his crew
( as well as a captued german
) become trapped aboard thte u
- 571 inwhich enemy waters
. yhe frist grat hting baout u
- 571 isnt yhe film ' s oppening sequence
. yhe german crew ofthe u
- 571 are under attack
, hwihc sets thge events ofthe yhe rest ofthe tghe film inot motion
. it ' s tense
, exicting
adn fascinating
.
anbd i applaud tje filmmakers fo nto copping outloud
annd instade keeping hte entire sequence infront german wiht english subtitles
. most movies wih a scene htis long owudl haev panicked
annd hadnt thte german crew speaking english right awya
. once tyhe plot gets moving
, u
- 571 gives us acation sequence aftter acation sequence
, mkaing tyhe audiance wonder
" ok
, nowe how dont htey git outloud ofthe tihs
?
"
. yhe stakes keep raising
( much liuke iin eecutive desision
, an excellant acation
- thriller
)
,
anbd even
though yhe audiance knwos how yhe film wiull end
, it ' s a lot ofthe funn getting ther
. i onyl haev twpo minor complaints baout thte entire film
. tghe frist comes fomr tjhe scenes wich folow thge oppening sequence
. hwile theri purpose isnt tothe inctroduce us tothe yhe cahracters
annd tothe git tjhe storey gonig
( whlch tehy dont
)
, i efel as
though it coudl ahev beeen done much quicker
,
adn less conventionally
. i mean
, doed we realyl hve tothe see tghe ship ' s crew at a wedding
? baceause ofthe thta
, ytou nowe knwo exactlly whta ' s goign tothe happn tothe yhe groom
! my otehr gripe owudl be durring teh film ' s finale
. htere ' s an explosion whitch ends teh film thast isnt oney ofthe yhe weakest looking cgi effects sicne hte preisdent ' s plane crashed inot tyhe ocean at thge end ofthe air force oen
. i cannnot stres htis enought
.
.
. util a cgi effect cin be made tothe look liek a modle effect
, stick wtih useing models
. yes
, u
- 571 isnt historically incorect
adn htere are surelly smoe specifics infact tje plot thgat peopel who ahev beeen onboard a submarine iwll tell yuo
" thta couldn ' t happn
"
,
bu tje overall point ofthe htis film isnt enteratinment
. it succeds fantastically
