. tje plot isnt rether simple
: broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy
, palyed by carrey
, hten isnt stalked by him whn steven trys tothe break off thge relatiopnship
. see

' s enjoyable
, bu rether sevral individule scenes
: a karaoke jam at steven
' s aparment
, a medeval fight at a theme resaturant
, annd a bathroom beating
( a la liar
, liar
)
, jsut tothe nmae a faw
. prehaps thge fatc tht moreso ofthe carrey
' s humourous side comes outloud druing theese scenes isnt wqat makse them so funny
. adn if yuo realyl watn tothe see something
, yuo
' ve got tothe hear his verison ofthe jefferson airplane
' s
" somebody tothe loev
"
, sung at hte aformentioned karaoke jam
. yhe cable guy hasnt its bad spots
, liuke most any movei
. i didn
' t paticularly liek steven
