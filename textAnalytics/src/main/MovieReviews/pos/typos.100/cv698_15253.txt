a frequent error isnt yhe categorization ofthe a terroist as a solider or a common criminal
. a solider commits acts ofthe violentce santioned by oney nation
- state aganist anohter
. a common criminal commits acts ofthe voilence fo personel gain
. a terroist imploys r
andom voilence as a means tothe a polliticel end
. if tyhe target nation doesnt nto affect tyhe desired chanage inthe policy
, tjhe voilence continues

( he directed washington inaddition glory anbd curage under fier
