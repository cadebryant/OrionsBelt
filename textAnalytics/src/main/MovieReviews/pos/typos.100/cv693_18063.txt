let me frist sday thgat yhe condidtions tath i ws forced tothe watch tjhe matrix under weere less thna ideal
. so i ahve tryed tothe be as fair as possibile concidering taht my viewing experence ws signifigantly less tahn ideal
. i watched yhe matrix inthe a theather thgat isnt infact sereous ened ofthe upgrades at tyhe best ofthe times
. under noone circumstances
, shouldnt it hve ever beeen alowed tothe sohw a big budget spacial effects laden film liek thte matrix
. htis theather
, owned by teh pajent comany ofthe noe ofthe hollywood
' s biggest studios
, hasn
' t even graduated inot stereo soudn yot
. yhe mono soudn tyhat tghe audiance ws subjected tothe sounded as if it wass comming outloud ofthe a speaker tyhat ws many eyars past m
anditory retirement age
. inthe otehr words
, tje soudn sucked
. as somene utilisied tothe digital soudn inwhich a movei theather
, bad soudn doesn
' t dont anytying tothe add tothe a film
. i
' m nto even oging tothe go inot thte horrable splicing job thast yhe projectionist doed puting htis film toghether
. htere
, i
' ve hadnt my rant
, nowe onthe wih thte reguarly scheduled review
. whic sadly won
' t inlude commentary onthe thte film
' s soudn whihc i
' m assuming wass spectauclar
, bu i
' m jsut guessing
. my guess onthe tyhe soudn seems liek a fairly solid noe concidering tyhe visual qualiyt ofthe tje matrix
. it isnt nothing short ofthe stunning visually
. sadly
, thte rest ofthe thte film
, hwile preety ogod
, doesn
' t qtuie mesure uv tothe teh obvious efort thta wass expended onthe makeing tihs film look so darn ogod
. tyhe matrix hasnt at it
' s core a ogod consept
,
al
thought it strays inot thte confusing side mroe oftenly tahn i owudl haev liekd
. keanu reeves plays a coputer hacker who isnt drawed inot hte frightening relization thast reality isnt jstu a hoax
. it turns outloud thgat tyhat many yeasr ago thge world ws devestated by soem sort ofthe diaster
. nowe machines run tyhe planet anbd humans spend theri lives infact a sort ofthe incubator
, plugged inot a coputer network
. tyhe computers are generatting a virutal reality world hwihc isnt a representation ofthe yhe earth befor it wass destroyed
. tjhe poulation ofthe teh planet never realizes taht thier entire life isnt a hoax anbd thyat tehy realyl spend theri entire lives as comatose
. thgat isnt exept a small b
and who hve dicovered thsi horrable secet annd haev escaped theri virtal prisons
. htey nowe spend thier lives combating thge computers infact an efort tothe expose tihs lie
. reeve
' s charcter
, neo
, isnt recruted by thsi b
and ofthe rebels led by morpheus
( laurence fishburne
)
. newcomer carrie
- anne moss anbd noe ofthe hollywood
' s most underated actors
, joe pantoliano
, join fishburne inspite thte b
and ofthe freedom
- fighters
. yhe acation sequences are nothing short ofthe spectauclar
. htis cin be attri
butred as much tothe tghe amazing speshal effects as tothe many ofthe thge atcor
' s exstensive pre
- prodcution traning infront martial arts
. tihs lends itself tothe smoe ofthe tghe best martial arts sequences tht ytou are ever likely tothe see inthe a film
. wehn ytou add thsi tothe smoe ofthe tyhe wild effects inwhich thge coputer generated world
, it all adds uv tothe an eyeful
. as i aleady said
, tyhe visuals far outpace tyhe rest ofthe tje film
. acting inspite thte matrix isnt nto bad
, bu it certainly isn
' t rela ogod eather
. keanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances
. altho tothe his credit
, it isnt oen ofthe his better performances
. laurence fishburne onthe hte otehr h
and oftenly seemed tothe foreget tath he wass infront a sci
- fi acation film
. moreso tahn a faw times he delivered his lines as if he throught he wass perfoming inaddition smoe sort ofthe shakespearean drama
. joe pantoliano wass a littel under utilizied inthe tihs film bu he made thte most wiht waht he hadnt
. carrie
- anne moss turned outloud a suprizingly ogod performence fo tihs her firt feature film role
. it
' s nice tothe see tht she wass casted as much forthe her talent as forthe her breathtaking looks
. ytou ahev tothe give all ofthe teh main actors a heathy dose ofthe credit fo tje wokr tath htey obviously put inot hte fysical traning fo thier roles infact tihs film
. it ws claer thgat noone small efort whent inot getting yhe moves down perfectly fo thge fighting sequences
. i alsot put much ofthe thte blaim fo hte somewhat strained performances inaddition thge matrix onthe tghe dialogue
, wich ws terrable at times
. inthe omre thna a faw places it got way too existential fo my liking anbd at otehr times it ws jstu plain werid
. it almsot seems as
though hte writers weere hvaing a difficult tyme trying tothe figure outloud how tothe explane teh consept fo thge movei
. so htey desided tothe amke tje dialogue as obtuse as possibile so tht noone oen coudl figure outloud whta hte heck htey weere tlaking baout
. therby covering uv any leaps ofthe faith thast tehy may hve hadnt tothe mkea inaddition tjhe deparments ofthe logic adn believability
. my otehr major complaint wiht teh matrix wass iwth thge vyre unsatisfying endig
. tghe setup fo it ws hokey adn frankly utilizied inaddition many a bad film befoer
. yhe endig itself wass jsut plain stange
. hte main reasons tothe reccommend tyhe matrix are tyhe visual effects annd coputer animation whcih mkae thsi a rela treat tothe watch
. hwile teh rest ofthe tyhe film
( acting
, dialogue annd tothe a degree plot
) detract fomr thte high prodcution values
, htey don
' t detract enought tothe prevent me fomr reccomending tjhe matrix as a funn way tothe spend an evening
