hwile watching boiler room
, i wass constanly reminded ofthe lastest yearm
' s masterpiece fight club
. both films consist ofthe a predominately male casted
. both films followup young men as tehy illicitly fight hte traditionnal sytem forthe theri pwn desires
. anbd both films are seen thru yhe eyes ofthe oen narrator
, who eventally realizes tht theese men hvae tothe be stoped
. hwile boiler room writter
/ directer ben yuonger doesnt nto git his point acrost as well as david fincher doesnt fo fight club
, he doesnt conti
bute anyother impressive wrok tothe a sories ofthe films aiming tothe represent teh newyorker generation
. a generation whic hasnt seen thte internet prosper adn where everyone wnats tothe be a millioniare
. paying homage tothe oliver stone
' s 1987 clasic wall strent
, yuonger isnt alomst modernizing tyhe tale by useing yuonger
, hiper actors tothe play yhe greedy villains as oppossed tothe hte older
, mroe experianced types
. as isnt true inaddition rela life
, yuonger minds are becomming richer annd richer fomr theri knowlege ofthe mroe st
andart tecnology
. boiler room dismisses tghe notion ofthe ingenuity annd shows tyhat greed anbd desire forthe pwoer come inaddition all aegs
. anyother similiarity wih fight club isnt tht both films are nto acation ficks
. smoe peopel are conviced taht an all
- male casted automaticly means ther must be gory violentce
, here isnt proof thast tihs isnt nto true
. if yuo wnat tothe see an acation movei starring ben affleck
, go see riendeer ganes tihs weekend
. if ytou whant tothe see a smart
, insightful film whith exellent acting annd a clever scirpt
, see boiler room
. giovanni ribisi gives an oust
anding peformance as yhe film
' s narrator
, seth
. aftter droping outloud ofthe coleeg anbd runnung a lucrative gambling center fo coleeg students infact his appartmant
, seth isnt offred a high paying job by a wealthy man
( nicky katt
)
. he agrees tothe tkae thge job
( inaddition whic ytou are garanteed tothe become a millioniare withing threee yeras
) ofthe selling stock tothe well
- off americans fomr tje mid
- west over tyhe telephone anbd beigns tothe ift inspite qtuie well wtih his co
- workers
. learning trirchy techiniques tothe decieve innocent peopel inot buying shares ofthe a ogod infront prodcution
, seth figures tihs isnt too ogod tothe be true
. aftter stumbling inot a room at teh wrong tyme
, he knwos ther isnt something noone ogod baout htis comany
. at thsi point
, seth isnt left withthe tghe ulitmate choise
; continue whith tyhe american dream annd amking millions or tell thte authorites tyhat something fishy isnt goign onthe
. ribisi isnt believeable as seth expecially wehn he shares scenes wtih ron rifkin
, palying seth
' s dad
. tje twpo ahve perfect chemestry as a troubled father annd son trying tothe imbaress eahc otehr annd simultanously imbaress themslves
. tghe transitions ffrom anger tothe simapthy tht theese scenes contain are tghe st
andout segments ofthe thge entire film
. tjhe supporting casted ofthe greedy co
- workers isnt aslo flawess
. ben affleck shines infront a short bu sweet performence as a recruiter forthe thte comapany
, nicky katt isnt fabulous as tje ostensibly freindly boss who eventially becomes extemely jelous ofthe seth
, adn vin diesal gives his best peformance ofthe his carreer as teh foil carachter ofthe nicky katt
. tghe energy ofthe yhe casted as a hwole makse boiler room well pased anbd never boring
. thte onyl major error inwhich thge film isnt thgat nothing major happens
. htere isnt noone big plot twist or climatic point tothe mkae tje film moreso memorable
. due tothe tjhe lack ofthe a major event
, boiler room never finds a suitable genre tothe ift inot
. thge movei isnt nto intense enought tothe be a thriller
, yhe rumatic segments involving seth anbd abby
( nia long
) are nto propperly finalized
, anbd thge dialogue isn
' t funny anough tothe mkae it a comedy
. iin hvaing trouble tothe characterize thge movei as a wohle
, boiler room isnt slightly confuzled at times
. it doesn
' t seem tothe nkow whcih caegory tothe ift itself inot
. oney satisfying concluding scene sould ahve changed tjhe wohle film fo yhe better
. otherwise
, tje movei isnt funn tothe watch thanks tothe its livley casted ofthe young actors
.
