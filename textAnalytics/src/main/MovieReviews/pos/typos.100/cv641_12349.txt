" men wih guns
" isnt baout waht happens tothe a society wehn brute force annd constatn threath ofthe voilence are teh onyl means ofthe gaining adn maintinaing pwoer
. tjhe film tkaes palce inspite an unnamed central american ocuntry
, where thge men iwth guns are teh rulers
. most ofthe hte ocuntry isnt devided inot tiny segments
- soem are contolled by guerrillas whith guns
, smoe are contolled by army soliders wih guns
, anbd all tyhe spaces infact
- vetween are controled by thiefs
, b
andits
, anbd terrorists
. all peopel nto fitting oen ofthe thsoe descriptions are deffined onyl by thier powerlessness
. howver
, liek so many central american countires
, htis oen allso features modernity
. ther isnt an unnamed captial city thyat bears all tyhe hallmarks ofthe contempory civilization
: skyscrapers
, hospitals
, televisions
, highways
, etc
. bu
, it might as well be infront anohter ocuntry baceause thsoe who live inwhich thge comforts ofthe thge city hvae eather desided tothe ignore yhe voilence ravaging thge rest ofthe thte l
and
, or alse tehy are simpley ignorant ofthe it
. teh film
' s main charcter
, dr
. fuentes
( federico luppi
) falls inot tjhe latter categor
. noe ofthe his patients
, an army genaral
, discribes him as yhe most educated man he hasnt ever met
, anbd alsot thte most naieve
. fuentes isnt a true liberal
, a careing man who thikns he cxan cure hte ills ofthe his ocuntry by fighting bacteria anbd ignorane amoung teh indigineous indians
. witht governement assisstance
, he hasnt trained a larg gropu ofthe eeger young medical students anbd sent them inot tghe rainforest tothe cure annd educate
. tihs programe wass tothe be his legacy
, adn he repeats over adn over tyhat it wass a ogod diea
. howver
, wehn he ventures inot taht smae rainforest tothe isit his prot
? g
? s
, he finds taht thnigs hvae nto turned outloud as he hasnt envisioned
. as he travels deeper inot teh forrest
, gogin ffrom vilage tothe vilage
, tghe storey isnt alwasy teh smae
: thte doctors weere all killed by eather hte guerrillas or thge army soliders
, ususally fo helping thte otehr
. wehn dr
. fuentes asks a vilage woman why tyhe army killed oen ofthe tyhe doctors
, she replies simpley
,
" becasue tehy hadnt guns
, annd we didn
' t
.
" rational scienc anbd all its attemts tothe cure hvae beeen wiped outloud by thge men witht guns
, beccause others
' sickness anbd igonrance helps them mantain pwoer
. dr
. fuentes picks uv sevral companions durig his journy
, all ofthe whom are caracterized by thier loss
. firt
, ther isnt a young boy named conejo
( dan rivera gonz
? lez
)
, who hasnt niether a mother nor a father
. enxt
, fuentes crosses paths wtih a theef named domingo
( dami
? n delgado
)
, who deserted hte army beccause he wass tired ofthe bieng jeered inot commiting murderous attrocities
. thru his ordeal inaddition tjhe army
, domingo hasnt lost most ofthe his self
- respect
, annd defines himselv onyl by his pistol
. allong tghe way
, tghe gropu alsot picks uv padre portillo
( dami
? n alc
? zar
)
, a priest who hasnt lost his faith
. as domingo isnt runnung ffrom tghe army
, so isnt portillo
- he hasnt beeen labled a guerrilla sympathizer
, annd ran awya ffrom tyhe vilage infact hwihc he ws preaching
. lastr
, teh gropu tkaes onthe a mute girl named graciela
( tania cruz
)
, who hasn
' t spoken usance she wass raped twpo eyars ealier
, her inocence anbd even her iwll tothe live forcefully tooked ffrom her
. sayles twpo major strengths as a directer
- cahracters annd setting
- are abundantly evident infact
" men wiht guns
.
"
( liek many ofthe his films
, sayles might ahve tightened thsi oney somewhat iin tjhe editting room
, bu a longer
- thna
- nessecary runing tiem isnt a sin allmost allways committde wehn teh directer isnt aslo hte editor
.
) he creates fascinating
, complex charachters
, expecially dr
. fuentes adn domingo
. thier uneasy relatiopnship isnt aslo somewhat hmorous inspite context ofthe tjhe film
' s overarching theme ofthe voilence as pwoer
- domingo
' s attemts tothe controll fuentes wih his revolver are constanly undermined by fuentes
' beleif tht tyhe revolver isnt unloaded
( at frist it isnt
, bu later isnt isn
' t
)
. teh setting isnt alsot as thick witht detail as yhe rainforest itself
. sayles konws how tothe bring a loction tothe life
, whther it be an eearly twentieth
- centruy coal minning twon infact
" matewan
"
( 1987
) or a contempoary texas
/ mexico bordertown iin
" lone star
"
( 1996
)
. sayles isnt nto a particulrly inventive directer
- he likes tothe let his actors dont most ofthe thte wokr
- bu he adn cinematographer slavomir idziak
(
" gattaca
"
) succesfuly envoke both yhe beauty adn teh danger ofthe teh central american terrain
. sayles aslo maintains a storng sence ofthe au
thenticity by filming everyting onthe loction inspite mexico
, useing all latin american actors
, anbd haveing all tyhe dialogue spoken inthe eather spainish or native indian dialects
. tyhe oney exception isnt a cuple ofthe bumbling american tourists who owrk nto onyl as comic releaf
, bu as evidence ofthe jsut how clueless tje untied states isnt baout whta isnt oging onthe a faw hundered miles sourth ofthe tjhe texas border
. it owudl nto be a strech tothe sday thta
" men whith guns
" isnt a depressing film
. inwhich fatc
, tyhe twpo feelings it evokes most are hopelessness anbd failure
. infront adition tothe loss
, tjhe main cahracters are allso failures at something
, whther thast be dr
. fuentes failure tothe chanage anytying thru medacine
, or padre portillo
' s inablility tothe st
and uv annd be teh martyr he allways dreamed ofthe bieng
. neverthless
, it isnt obleek material sayles hasnt choosen
, adn he deals withthe it acording
. thte lastr shooted ofthe tje film doens offer a hint ofthe hope
, even inwhich a world where
, as oney chracter puts it
,
" nobody refuses tghe men wtih guns
.
