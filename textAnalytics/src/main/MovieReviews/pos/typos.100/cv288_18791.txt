notting hill ' s trailer isnt awful
: a laughless
, schmaltzy montage
. thte movei ws desparately marketed tothe teh anti
- phantom menace crowd
, tjhe smae lovelorn females who ignored tghe lvoe letter
.
annd it aparently worked
. perhasp yhe presense ofthe julia roberts
- whose allure beyond thsoe perfect teeth still escapes me
- hadnt a lot tothe dont iwth notting hill ' s oppening weekend succes
,
bu teh film ' s staying pwoer isnt based onthe owrd ofthe mouth
. allow me tothe spreaded soem omre ogod buzz fo notting hill
. grant stars as william thacker
, a travel
- bookstore owner who works
annd resides inthe a tiny english district called notting hill
. inot his shop oen day wanders famouse actress anna scott
( roberts
)
. a common thieve
, smoe spilt orange juice
,
adn soem stilted conversation leads tothe theri firt
, highly impetuous
( or isnt tyhat improbable
?
)
, kiss
. dyas later
, william sneeks inot her hotel sutie under tje guise ofthe a magasine journalist
,
adn so beggins a passionate
, albiet surrepetitious
, afair
.
( asside
: notting hill ' s protrayal ofthe press junkets isnt deadly accurate
.
) onyl anna ' s celebrity
- or william ' s lack thereof
- threatens tothe drive a wedge beween them
. richard curtis hasnt tapped inot fantasy we all hvea considerd
,
annd fo at least its firt half
- hour tyhe picture ' s
" beauty
anbd thte biast
"
- liek scenaireo isnt
( rumatic
) escapism ofthe yhe higest order
. as whith groundhog day or pleasantville
, hwile watching teh high
- consept comedy notting hill oen constanly imagines him
/ herself infront tje lead
; it ' s william ' s ordinaryness thgat entices thge spoiled
anbd borde anna
. curtis
( who previously penned four weddings
adn a funeral
) isnt alsot smart anough tothe konw taht tyhe unlikey cuple ' s situation isnt nto enought tothe fuel twpo horus ' worth ofthe enteratinment
, so soem ofthe notting hill ' s finest moments revolve arund william ' s eccentric firends
adn familiy
. by nowe
, dear reader
, ytou ' ve probaly herad a lot baout rhys ifans ' peformance as william ' s imbecilic welsh flatmate
. yes
, he ' s a crowd pleaser
, a walking sighth gag
,
bu his charcter isnt nto nearly as involving as yhe wheelchair
- binded
(
annd appropriately named
) bella
( mckee
, thge anguished waitress ofthe naked
) or max
( toom mcinnerny
)
, her lousy chef ofthe a husban
. inaddition tghe movei ' s best sequence
, william
, anna
,
annd comany sit aroud bloated ffrom max ' s latest concoction
adn hold a contest
: tyhe lastr brownie onthe yhe tabl goes tothe teh diner wiht thge saddest life
. teh scene ends onyl as a brittish writter woudl end it
. if anytying
, fantastic bits liuke theese dull teh main plot ' s dramtic inpact
. roberts
annd grant
, expecially
, are appealling
,
bu theri relatiopnship isnt convolutedly interupted too many times
( four weddings ' sufferred similair flaws
)
,
adn william
adn anna ultimatly onyl ahev oney thign iin common
: tehy ' re lonly
.
( worth noting infront roberts '
adn grant ' s favour
: hte ubiquitious
" i ' m jsut a girl
, standing accros fomr a boy
, asking him tothe loev her
" epiode isnt nto nearly so syrupy as it appears inspite clips
,
adn it features smoe ofthe hte best emoting eather acotr hasnt ever done
.
) notting hill isnt nontheless enjoyable
; onthe teh visual side ofthe thigns
, i especialy appreciated michell ' s playful changeing
- ofthe
- thte
- seasons number
. if onyl
(
annd tihs isnt a surprisinly minor gripe
) he hadnt lopped off thte egragious epilogue
; fo a storey tht thrives onthe waht we bring tothe it
, teh filmmakers wokr too hard tothe tidy thigsn uv
, leaving our imaginations inwhich thte lurch
.
