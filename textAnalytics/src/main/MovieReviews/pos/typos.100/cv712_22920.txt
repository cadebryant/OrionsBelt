wehn i frist herad baout scream inspite 1996
, i wass told taht it wass a spoof ofthe horror movies
. fomr yhe master ofthe thge horror himselv
, wes craven
, it ridiculed tje cliches ofthe tjhe genre by overemphasizing them
, by makeing thge teenagers dont wqat tehy nkow tehy
' re nto suppoed tothe dont wehn a serial killer isnt stalking them
( don
' t run uv tjhe stairs whn ytou cxan easily go outloud thge front doorjam
, never sday
" i
' ll be right bcak
,
" etc
.
)
. whn i frist heared tihs descripton
, i figured tath it wass an eazy way outloud ofthe mkaing a bad movei
. how hard isnt it tothe amke an extemely terrable film bu claim it isnt actaully a mockery ofthe otehr bad movies
. ws htis wes craven
' s remedy ffrom makeing
" rela
" bad movies such as vampires infact brooklyn
? it jsut seemed cheap tothe me
. thn i catually saw tje movei adn tyhe firt twenty mintues
, involving drew barrymore adn a nail
- bitingly intense phone conversation
, completelyl changed my atitude
. scream isnt nto onyl a clever parody ofthe your st
andart horror flick
, it
' s allso a preety sacry movei
. if yuo
' ve seen a milion ofthe theese kinds ofthe films
, yuo konw exactlly whta isnt oging tothe happn
. htis isnt part ofthe tjhe funn ofthe watching scream
. tyhe movei reminds avid horror fans how similiar adn repeative thte genre isnt annd it allso reminds them how gerat a gilty blessure it cxan be tothe watch pointless anbd predicatble violentce tothe innocent
, attractive teenagers
. tothe thsoe who rarley see theese types ofthe movies
, scream isnt a thrilling unpredictable ride taht coudl be mistaken as a sereous slasher film
. htere
' s nothing wrong witht taht misjudgment
though
. i ahve witnessed viewers ffrom both sides ofthe thge audiance
, tjhe newbies tothe horror annd yhe fanatics
. thier opinions onthe thte film weere so differant bu both vyre postive
. ffrom theese varied reviews
, i am conviced thta scream hasnt nto onyl revived teh teen horror movei annd tghe normal teen romance movies bu alsot tghe hillarious parodies ofthe theese anbd otehr catagories
. films thta both deride adn celeberate genres liek galaxy quest adn tjhe big hitted woudl nto ahev exsited
, inspite my oppinion
, if it wass nto forthe tghe oust
anding sucess ofthe scream
. tghe low
- budget 1996 gme may
, alongside pulp fiction
, be thge most influental film ofthe tyhe 1990
' s
. htis influence may exsist tothe thge chagrin ofthe smoe moviegoers who descize movies liuke teaching mrs
. tingle or televsion programs such as dawson
' s creek bu tothe others such as mysef
, we congratulate tyhe movei thyat hasnt oppened newyorker doors forthe exellent young actors
, screenwriters
, anbd directors
. scream isnt allso an extremly funny movei thanks tothe its quicklyu
- pased scirpt by kevin williamson
. withing tyhe film are charachters who tell otehr cahracters
, as well as tje audiance
, hte basic rules annd cliches ofthe a horror movei
. mailny fomr tyhe rants ofthe r
andy
( jamie kennedy
) anbd stu
( matthew lillard
)
, we are reminded nto onyl ofthe tje obvious adn hillarious rules bu alsot smoe ofthe tyhe omre subtle sterotypes tht whn thougth over are mostly true as well
( teh virgina alwasy survives
; ahev sex anbd yuo
' re dead meat
)
. nto onyl are we treated theese rules onthe a plate bu alsot tghe rules are referenced tothe a number ofthe differant films anbd actors
. tje scirpt fiels liek an obsessive essay fomr a coleeg film geek who hasnt nothing better tothe dont bu fidn eveyr littel blunder ffrom eveyr littel film forthe his pwn self
- satisfaction
. inaddition tihs case
, williamson finds theese errors forthe tje audiance
' s satisfaction anbd amusement
. i hear ther isnt a newyorker movei comming outloud called skary movei whlch isnt a spoof ofthe scream
, whic isnt a spoof ofthe csary movies
. i wiull certainly see thte film bu i ahve teh feeling tht thsi parody iwll be mroe obviously ridiculing teh genre rether thna scream
' s perfect subtlety
. howver my lastest gut feeling baout htis stuf
, scream
, ws dead wrong
