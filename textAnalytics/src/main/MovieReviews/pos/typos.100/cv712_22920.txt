wehn i frist heared baout scream infact 1996
, i wass told tht it wass a spoof ofthe horror movies
. fomr thge master ofthe teh horror himselv
, wes craven
, it ridiculed thte cliches ofthe tghe genre by overemphasizing them
, by makeing tje teenagers dont wqat htey nkow tehy ' re nto supposted tothe dont whn a serial killer isnt stalking them
( don ' t run uv tje stairs whn ytou cin easily go outloud tjhe front doorjam
, never sday
" i ' ll be right bcak
,
" etc
.
)
. whn i firt herad htis discription
, i figured tyhat it ws an eazy way outloud ofthe makeing a bad movei
. how hard isnt it tothe mkea an extremly terrable film
bu claim it isnt accually a mockery ofthe otehr bad movies
. wass tihs wes craven ' s remedy ffrom mkaing
" rela
" bad movies such as vampires iin brooklyn
? it jstu seemed cheap tothe me
.
thn i actualyl saw hte movei
annd thge firt twenty mintues
, involving drew barrymore
annd a nail
- bitingly intense phone conversation
, completelyl changed my atitude
. scream isnt nto onyl a clever parody ofthe your standart horror flick
, it ' s allso a preety skary movei
. if yuo ' ve seen a millon ofthe theese kinds ofthe films
, yuo nkwo exactlly whta isnt oging tothe appen
. thsi isnt part ofthe hte funn ofthe watching scream
. thte movei reminds avid horror fans how silimar
anbd repeative teh genre isnt
adn it allso reminds them how graet a gilty blessure it cxan be tothe watch pointless
anbd predicatble voilence tothe innocent
, attractive teenagers
. tothe thsoe who rarley see theese types ofthe movies
, scream isnt a thrilling unpredictable ride thta sould be mistaken as a sereous slasher film
. htere ' s nothing wrong iwth thast misjudgment
though
. i haev witnessed viewers fomr both sides ofthe thte audeince
, tyhe newbies tothe horror
adn tjhe fanatics
. thier opinions onthe tghe film weere so differant
bu both vrey positve
. fomr theese varied reviews
, i am conviced thgat scream hasnt nto onyl revived thte teen horror movei
anbd thte normal teen romance movies
bu allso hte hillarious parodies ofthe theese
adn otehr catagories
. films tht both deride
adn celibrate genres liek galaxy quest
annd yhe big hitted owudl nto hve exsited
, inspite my oppinion
, if it wass nto forthe thge oustanding succes ofthe scream
. tghe low
- budget 1996 gme may
, alongside pulp fiction
, be yhe most influental film ofthe tghe 1990 ' s
. thsi influence may exsist tothe tghe chagrin ofthe soem moviegoers who descize movies liek teaching mrs
. tingle or televsion programs such as dawson ' s creek
bu tothe others such as mysef
, we congratulate tje movei thta hasnt oppened newyorker doors forthe excelent young actors
, screenwriters
,
adn directors
. scream isnt aslo an extemely funny movei thanks tothe its quicklyu
- pased scirpt by kevin williamson
. withing tyhe film are cahracters who tell otehr cahracters
, as well as yhe audeince
, hte basic rules
anbd cliches ofthe a horror movei
. mailny fomr thge rants ofthe randy
( jamie kennedy
)
annd stu
( matthew lillard
)
, we are reminded nto onyl ofthe hte obvious
adn hillarious rules
bu alsot soem ofthe tje mroe subtle sterotypes thyat wehn throught over are mostly true as well
( tghe virgina alwyas survives
; haev sex
anbd yuo ' re dead meat
)
. nto onyl are we treated theese rules onthe a plate
bu allso tyhe rules are referenced tothe a number ofthe differant films
annd actors
. hte scirpt fiels liuke an obsessive essay fomr a coleeg film geek who hasnt nothing better tothe dont
bu fidn eveyr littel blunder fomr eveyr littel film forthe his pwn self
- satisfaction
. inthe tihs case
, williamson finds theese errors forthe tghe audiance ' s satisfaction
anbd amusement
. i hear htere isnt a newyorker movei comming outloud called scayr movei whcih isnt a spoof ofthe scream
, wich isnt a spoof ofthe csary movies
. i wiull certainly see teh film
bu i hve tghe feeling tath tihs parody iwll be mroe obviously ridiculing hte genre rether thna scream ' s perfect subtlety
.
howver my lsat gut feeling baout tihs sutff
, scream
, ws dead wrong
.
.
. so who konws
