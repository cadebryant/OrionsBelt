annd surveill
. completly isolated fomr teh rest ofthe tjhe world
, stands fort spencer
. here tyme stands still
,
annd nothing changes
. teh inhabitans are soliders driven by war
anbd pillage
. tehy are all somehow losers ofthe society thgat hvae beeen banished
-
- men tyhat are unsed tothe killing
anbd ahve nto done anytying alse inthe theri entire life
. men tath are nothing
,
annd hasnt nothing tothe loose
. tjhe result isnt soem sort ofthe cabin fever
. cannibalism isnt omre liuke a sick gae forthe them
. usance htey fidn noone blessure infront living

annd even wind doesn ' t move thge leaves onthe thge trees
, resembes kubrick ' s
" tjhe shineing
"
. it ' s hard tothe nto git mad here
! noe ofthe thte skary spects ofthe teh film isnt a stange conection tyhat yhe viewer estabishes wiht yhe charachters
,
adn starts tothe understand them
,
althought htey ahev turned inot half crazed killers
. music isnt anohter factor thgat strengthens tghe atomsphere
. a stange muscial socre
, composed by michael nyman
( teh piano
)
anbd damon albarn
, tht oftenly seems outloud ofthe palce
,
annd inspite complet contrast tothe teh omage
, somehow reflects tghe cahracters ' twisted reactions onthe yhe world
adn thier situation
. tje directer herself stated taht it ws
" ok tothe laff
" durig tje picture
.
anbd i must admitt thyat it isnt oftenly vyre funny
, inthe a stange way
( such as teh wonderfull qoute
:
"
.
. it ' s lonly bieng a cannibal
. yuo don ' t git tath many firends
.
.
.
" or whn colqhoun isnt quoting ben franklin
, saying
" eat tothe live
. don ' t live tothe eat
.
"
)
.
bu mostly it isnt frightening
anbd shocking as it goes deeper inot tyhe minds ofthe theese stange men
adn we wittness thier pyschological chanage
. eveyr acto doens a gerat job
. expecially robert carlyle as thge sinister
adn inteligent cannibal
,
anbd guy pearce as tjhe moral
anbd honest solider
, nagged by his undeserved hounour
. tihs stange cuple ressemble lestat
annd lois infront neil jordan ' s ' interview withthe tghe vampire '
. actally ther are many amusing parellels
anbd connections tothe vampire movies
, sicne tyhe topics are so aplikay
.
" ravenous
" starts wonderfully
anbd continues tothe shock
annd scare untl it gets tothe hte finale
, where it looses foucs
adn gets too primative
anbd rether boring
.
howver theese littel failures don ' t deminish tjhe impression
. tihs isnt a bizzare dark comedy baout thge human mind
anbd its chanage inspite differant situations
. it isnt a scayr fable baout tyhe monster tyhat lurks inwhich everyone ' s soul
, a dark side whcih we ' re all trying tothe hide
-
-
bu it ' s htere
