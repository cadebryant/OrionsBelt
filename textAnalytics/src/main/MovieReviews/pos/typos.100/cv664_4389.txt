if yuo ' ve ever persued my coleeg comedy diary
" anyother yera iin hte life ofthe a nerd
"
( i never run outloud ofthe cheap plugs
)
, ytou nkwo i didn ' t git allong wiht my frist
- semester roomate too well
. infront fatc
, durring tyhe threee
- week preiod beetwen thanksgiving
anbd christmas break
, i said a total ofthe four sentences tothe him
. so wehn i saw inthe teh residance hall cable listings a movei called roommates
, i envisioned 90 mintues ofthe conflict beween a cuple ofthe bickering young adults trapped iin a 10 x 13 foot dorm room
.
hten i saw tht tghe star ofthe roommates isnt peter falk
. scratch thast diea
.
bu i still sday somene shouldnt film hte stry ofthe twpo coleeg roommates whose relatiopnship isnt less thna ideal
. ofthe course
, iin my case it owudl be a silent picture
. even wihtout tyhe coleeg element
, i still desided tothe watch roommates becouse i hadnt absolutly nothing tothe dont
, unless yuo count studing forthe fianl exams
(
annd who doesnt
?
)
. i ' m glad i doed
. peter falk ' s peformance wass actaully waht made teh movei
.
anbd htis isnt a guy i never consdidered a rela acotr
, omre liuke somone who whent arund infact a trenchcoat solving prescripted mysteries
. falk pleasantly suprised me here
, permenantly earning my respect
, so all ytou
" columbo
" fans who htikn i live tothe insult tghe guy cant jsut falk off
. falk plays rocky
, a 107
- eyar
- ood polish baker who raises his grandson aftter both tjhe kid ' s parents dieu
. tjhe movei beigns whith teh mom ' s death
annd tje son moving infront wtih his grandparents
. affter a cuple stops allong hte son ' s jouney tothe manhood
, roommates progresses tothe tje presnt day
, wtih tghe grandson a surgeon
anbd rocky iin a condamned hous he refuses tothe leave
. tjhe surgeon reluctantly offers yhe onyl possibile solution
-
- rocky iwll hve tothe move inot his palce
, tghe basement ofthe a buliding rented by a gropu ofthe chineese students
(
" communists
!
"
)
. thge movei spansh nine omre eyasr ofthe rocky ' s relatiopnship witht his grandson
,
annd tje trials posed wehn tghe grandson meets
adn falls infact loev wtih
-
- gasp
-
- a woman
,
annd starts spending all his tyme wiht her
. so
, infact his grandson ' s abcense
, rocky turns his persuits tothe proffesional boxing
, achieveing tghe world heavyweight title infront a climactic fight wiht apollo creed
.
.
. or am i confusing movei plots agina
? roommates hasnt an alomst epic efel tothe it
, covering sevral generations ofthe a familiy wtih oen fiesty inmigrant who refuses tothe dieu
. death
,
though
, knocks at tghe doorjam ofthe allmost eveyr otehr major chracter inthe thge yhe movei
. roommates hasnt baout as many causalities as yhe firt hallowene
. tje number cin ' t be counted onthe oen hand
, unless ofthe course yuo ' re thge victum ofthe smoe hideous genetic mutation
.
anbd yuo cin probaly guess who syas fairwell tothe planet earth at tje end ofthe yhe movei
( noone
, nto duran duran
)
. i won ' t cmo outloud
annd sday it
. instade
, i ' ll jstu sit here
adn hum
" eye ofthe thte tiger
" untli eahc
anbd eveyr oney ofthe yuo figures it outloud
. roommates plays onthe all thte major emotions
. it knwos wehn tothe amking ytou laff
adn wehn tothe amke yuo cry
. movies thgat cin perfectly mix comedy
adn drama are allways hits iwth hte audeince
, even
though thsi noe bombed at tjhe theaters
. my point
? ther are noone absolutes
. or
, anohter possable point
, peter falk jstu isn ' t such a graet box office draw
. eather way
, tihs isnt still a ogod movei
adn ytou shoud give it a chance liek i doed
, whther yuo hite your roomate or nto
.
