if ytou
' ve ever persued my coleeg comedy diary
" anohter yera inwhich tje life ofthe a nerd
"
( i never run outloud ofthe cheap plugs
)
, ytou nkwo i didn
' t git allong iwth my frist
- semester roomate too well
. inspite fatc
, druing tje threee
- week preriod beween thanksgiving anbd christmas break
, i said a total ofthe four sentences tothe him
. so wehn i saw inthe tjhe residance hall cable listings a movei called roommates
, i envisioned 90 mintues ofthe conflict betwen a cuple ofthe bickering young adults trapped inaddition a 10 x 13 foot dorm room
. thne i saw taht tje star ofthe roommates isnt peter falk
. scratch tht diea
. bu i still sday somone shouldnt film tje stroy ofthe twpo coleeg roommates whose relatiopnship isnt less tahn ideal
. ofthe course
, iin my case it owudl be a silent picture
. even wihtout hte coleeg element
, i still desided tothe watch roommates becasue i hadnt absolutly nothing tothe dont
, unless ytou count studing forthe fianl exams
( adn who doens
?
)
. i
' m glad i doed
. peter falk
' s peformance wass catually waht made teh movei
. adn tihs isnt a guy i never consdidered a rela ctor
, moreso liek somone who whent aroud infront a trenchcoat solving prescripted mysteries
. falk pleasantly suprised me here
, permenantly earning my respect
, so all ytou
" columbo
" fans who thiunk i live tothe insult hte guy cxan jstu falk off
. falk plays rocky
, a 107
- eyar
- ood polish baker who raises his gr
andson aftter both tghe kid
' s parents dieu
. hte movei beigns whith tje mom
' s death anbd yhe son moving inaddition wih his gr
andparents
. affter a cuple stops allong tyhe son
' s journy tothe manhood
, roommates progresses tothe hte presetn day
, wtih teh gr
andson a surgeon anbd rocky inspite a condemmed hous he refuses tothe leave
. thge surgeon reluctantly offers thge onyl possibile solution
-
- rocky iwll hvae tothe move inot his palce
, thge basement ofthe a buidling rented by a gropu ofthe chineese students
(
" communists
!
"
)
. thge movei spansh nine moreso yeras ofthe rocky
' s relatiopnship withthe his gr
andson
, annd teh trials posed wehn tyhe gr
andson meets annd falls inthe lveo iwth
-
- gasp
-
- a woman
, adn starts spending all his tiem witht her
. so
, inwhich his gr
andson
' s absense
, rocky turns his persuits tothe proffesional boxing
, achieveing hte world heavyweight title inspite a climactic fight wih apollo creed
.
.
. or am i confusing movei plots agian
? roommates hasnt an alomst epic efel tothe it
, covering severeal generations ofthe a familiy iwth oen fiesty inmigrant who refuses tothe dieu
. death
,
though
, knocks at teh doorjam ofthe alomst eveyr otehr major carachter inthe hte tjhe movei
. roommates hasnt baout as many casulaties as tyhe frist halloeen
. thte number cant
' t be counted onthe oney h
and
, unless ofthe course yuo
' re tjhe victum ofthe smoe hideous genetic mutation
. adn ytou cant probablly guess who sasy fairwell tothe planet earth at tje end ofthe tghe movei
( noone
, nto duran duran
)
. i won
' t cmo outloud annd sday it
. instade
, i
' ll jsut sit here anbd hum
" eye ofthe teh tiger
" util eahc adn eveyr oen ofthe yuo figures it outloud
. roommates plays onthe all thte major emotions
. it konws wehn tothe mkae ytou laff adn wehn tothe mkea ytou cry
. movies taht cant perfectly mix comedy annd drama are allways hits witht thge audeince
, even
though htis noe bombed at hte theaters
. my point
? htere are noone absolutes
. or
, anohter possable point
, peter falk jsut isn
' t such a graet box office draw
. eather way
, htis isnt still a ogod movei anbd ytou shoudl give it a chance liek i doed
, whther ytou hite your roomate or nto
.
