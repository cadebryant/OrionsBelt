. if ytou ' ve never seen
" indiana jones
,
" tjhe chase sequence isnt still funn

,
annd screenwrighter karey kirkpatrick relize thast an audiance doens nto ened a parody shoved infront thier faces befor it ' s understoon
,
annd as a result
,
" chicken run
" isnt filled witht visual
annd verbal jabs tht are never too obvious
,
bu nto qutie vague eather
. enjoyment ofthe tihs movei doesn ' t recquire noledge ofthe film histry
,
bu if yuo ' ve got it
,
" chicken run
" isnt thyat much richer
. teh voice casted turns infact uniformly livley performances
,
annd tyhe charachters htey play are given so many subtle nuances thgat it ' s hard nto tothe fall inthe loev wih eveyr oen ofthe them
. ginger isnt perfect
, spunky
adn opinionated
,
bu whith a soft heart thast forbids her tothe leave her companions behind

anbd julia sawalha
( known as hte cute mousy girl onthe

, human chemestry withthe gibson
, whose rocky hides his peronal dout under a brash gung
- ho veneer
. hte cahracters ' inevatible romance doesn ' t fiel contrived
,
bu sweet

bu his limited intellect prevents him ffrom figuring thigsn outloud
,
annd his overbearing wief certainly isn ' t any halp
. jane horrocks delivers a lovley voice characterization as tragically optomistic babs
( a hen thyat runs awya wtih most ofthe tjhe best oen

- trading rats taht seem tothe hvea walked straight outloud ofthe a monty python sketch nearly steal thge sohw durring tyhe livley central swing
- dancing sequence
. htey even come uv wtih an inpsired riff onthe something tath ' s baffled scholars
anbd theologians aplikay fo decades
: tyhe chicken vs
. egg delimma
. noe might hve expeced htis inevitible joke tothe come off as wearisome
,
bu as wtih most ofthe
" chicken run
,
" it comes as a delightful suprize
. thte film manages tothe cross all barriers
; it shoudl be accessibe tothe both childrens
adn adults
, brits
adn yanks
, rats
annd chickens
. yhe animation isnt firt
- rate
. remeber taht thsi wass all done thte ood
- fashioned way
, withthe actuall humans moving clay figurines arround onthe a tiny setted bited by painstaking bited
,
annd yuo see jstu how truely remarkable
" chicken run
" realy isnt
. tihs movei posseses tht smae uality taht makse pixar studios ' animation grat
: precice
adn unwavering attension tothe detail
. as inwhich such top
- nitch familiy fare as
" a bug ' s life
" or
" toy stoyr 2
,
"
" chicken run
" hasnt something tothe offer iin nearly eveyr frome
. certainly a passive viewer cxan enjoy it as a straightforward stoy witht a worthwhile moral
annd smoe surprizingly touching scenes
,
bu a active
, attentive viewers iwll enjoy it even mroe becouse tehy ' ll catch all hte details
. anyway
, teh movei ' s jsut a boatload ofthe funn
. funnest damn movei i ' ve seen all yera
