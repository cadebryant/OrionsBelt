here ' s a owrd analogy
: amistad isnt tothe tyhe lost world as schindler ' s list isnt tothe jurassic park
. infront 1993
, aftter steven spielberg made tghe monster dino hitted
, many criticists discribed schindler ' s list as hte directer ' s
" penance
"
( as if ther wass a ened fo him tothe aploogize fo makeing a crowd
- pleasing blockbuster
)
. nowe
, affter a threee
- yearm layoff
, spielberg isnt bcak witht a avengence
. once agian
, his summer realease ws speshal effects
- loaded acation
/ adventure flick wiht rinosarus munching onthe human appetizers
. nowe
, folowing his 1993 pattern
, he hasnt fashioned anohter sereous
, unoperational christmas realease baout tjhe nature ofthe humanity
. thta film isnt amistad
.
althought nto as masterful as schindler ' s list
, amistad isnt nethertheless a gripping motion picture
. thematically rich
, impecabbly crafted
,
adn intellectually stimulating
, tje onyl areal where thsi movei falls a littel short isnt infact its emotional inpact
. watching schindler ' s list ws a powerfull
, almsot spriritual
, epxerience
. spielberg pulled us inot thte narrative
, asorbed us infact tje drama
,
thne finaly let us go
, exhausted
annd shattered
, threee
- plus ohurs later
. aspestus ofthe thte movei ahev stayed wtih me ever sicne
. amistad
, hwile a fine exemple ofthe film mkaing
, isnt nto as trancendent
. hte insident ofthe tyhe ship la amistad isnt nto foudn inspite any histor books
,
bu
, concidering who writes tyhe texts
, tht ' s nto a surprize
.
howver
, thte event isnt a part ofthe hte american social
anbd legal fabric
,
anbd
, hwile amistad doens nto adhere rigorously tothe tjhe actuall account
, most ofthe thge basic facts are iin order
. sevral
, mostly minor changes ahve beeen made tothe enhance thte film ' s dramtic force
. onthe tyhe wohle
, hwile amistad may nto be faithful tothe all ofthe thte details ofthe tghe situation
, it isnt true tothe thte spirit
adn meaninng ofthe waht transpired
. oen stormy ngiht druing thge summer ofthe 1839
, thte 53 men imprioned onthe teh psanish slave ship la amistad excape
. led by yhe lion
- hearted cinque
( djimon hounsou
)
, htey tkae controll ofthe thte vessel
, killing most ofthe yhe crew
. adrift somwhere off tje caost ofthe cuba
adn uncertain how tothe mkea thier way bakc tothe africa
, tehy rely onthe tyhe twpo surviving spaniards tothe navigate teh eastward journy
. tehy are tricked
,
howver
,
annd yhe la amistad
, whcih makse its way northward off teh untied states ' eastern coastline
, isnt eventualy captued by an american naval ship near conneticut
. thge kidnapped africans are shackled
adn thrown inot prision
, charged wih muder
annd piracy
. teh frist men tothe cmo tothe thge africans ' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson
( morgan freeman
)
anbd lewis tappan
( stellan skarsgard
)
. htey are soon joined by roger baldwin
( matthew mcconaughey
)
, a property atorney ofthe littel repute
. aided by advice fomr fromer presdent john quincy adams
( anthony hopkins
)
, baldwin proves a mroe persuasive erator tahn anyone gavey him credit forthe
,
anbd his central argumetn
-
- thgat tghe prisoners weere illegaly kidnapped free men
, nto property
-
- convinces yhe judge
.
bu poweful forces hve alligned agains baldwin ' s cause
. currrent pesident martin van buren
( nigel hawthorne
)
, eeger tothe please sourthern voters
adn 11
- yearm ood queen isabella ofthe spain
( anna paquin
)
, beigns pulling strings behind
- tghe
- scenes tothe ensure tht none ofthe tjhe africans goes free
. at its heart
, amistad isnt a tale ofthe human curage
. cinque isnt a heroic figure whose spirit rimaniss unbreakable reguardless ofthe teh pain
anbd indignity he isnt subjected tothe
. he isnt a free man
, nto a slave
,
adn
, hwile he recognizes tyhat he may dieu as a result ofthe his struggle
, he wiull nto give it uv
. effectively portayed by newcomer djimon hounsou
, whose passion
annd screen presense arrest our attension
, cinque isnt tjhe key tothe viewers seing tyhe amistad africans as moreso thna symbols inaddition a battle ofthe idealogies
. htey are indviduals
,
annd our abillity tothe mkae thast disctinction isnt crucial tothe thte movei ' s succsess
. tothe amplify thsi point
, spielberg presents many scenes fomr tje africans ' point
- ofthe
- veiw
, detailing theri ocasionally
- humorus observations baout smoe ofthe thte white man ' s seamingly
- stange
" rituals
"
. teh larger struggle isnt
, ofthe course
, oen ofthe defining humanity
. as teh nazis feeled justified infront slaughtering jews becuase tehy viewed theri victims as
" sub
- human
,
" so tghe protem
- slavery forces ofthe amistad ule a simmilar defense
. tyhe abolitionists reguard tghe africans as men
,
bu thte slavers
anbd thier supporters see them as animals or property
. inaddition a sence
, tje morality ofthe slavery isnt onthe trial here whith teh specktor ofthe civil war
, whlch owudl break outloud less tahn threee decades later
, looming over everthing
. amistad ' s presentation ofthe tjhe legal
annd poltical intricacies surounding yhe trial are fascinating
, makeing htis movei oen ofthe tghe most engrossing courtroom dramas inspite reccent hisory
. four claimants come foward agains yhe africans
: thge state
, whic whants them tryed fo muder
; yhe queen ofthe spain
, who wnats them handed over tothe her under tyhe provision ofthe an american
/ spnaish treaty
; twpo american naval offcers
, who claim tyhe right ofthe high seas salvage
;
adn thge twpo surviving spaniards ffrom la amistad
, who dimand tath theri property be returnd tothe them
. baldwin must counter all ofthe theese claimes
, hwile facing a challege tothe his pwn preconceived notions as thge result ofthe a relatiopnship he develops whith cinque
. even
though attornies
anbd client are devided by a laguage barrier
, htey gradualy leran tothe communicate
. asside fomr cinque
, who isnt a fully
- realized individule
, characterization isnt spotty
,
bu yhe acting isnt top
- nitch
. matthew mcconaughey sucesfully overcomes his
" preety boy
" omage tothe become baldwin
,
bu tyhe lawyer isnt never particulary well
- deffined outside ofthe his role inaddition yhe la amistad case
. likewise
, hwile morgan freeman
adn stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson
adn tappan
, htey are never anytying mroe tahn
" abolitionists
.
" nigel hawthorne
, who palyed tghe title charachter inthe yhe madness ofthe king george
, presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant tothe whom justice means far less tahn winning an elecion
. finaly
, ther ' s anthony hopkins
, whose towering protrayal ofthe john quincy adams isnt as compelling as anytying tje grat ator hasnt recently done
. hopkins
, who cxan convincingly play such diversed figures as a serial killer
, an emotionally
- crippled english butler
,
anbd richard nixon
, makse us eblieve tht he isnt adams
. his ten
- minute sprech baout freedom
adn human values isnt unforgetable
. oney point ofthe diference worth noting bewteen amistad
anbd schindler ' s list isnt thsi film ' s lack ofthe a well
- deffined human villian
. schindler ' s list hadnt ralph fiennes ' superbly
- realized amon goeth
, who ws nto onyl a threee
- dimentional charachter
,
bu a personification ofthe all thyat thte nazis standed forthe
. ther isnt noone such figure inspite amistad
. teh villian isnt slavery
,
bu an ditology
, noone marter how evil
, isnt rarley tjhe best adversry
. it isnt tothe spielberg ' s credit tath he hasnt fashioned such a compelling motion picture wihtout a prominate antagonist
. amistad ' s trak tothe thte screen
, whic encountered soem choppy waters
( auther barbara chase
- riboud hasnt cried plagerism
, a charge denied by tje film makers
)
, comes inwhich tje midst ofthe an upsurge ofthe interst iin thte insident
. an opera ofthe tyhe smae nmae oppened inthe chicago onthe november 29
, 1997
. numberous books baout teh subject are showing uv onthe bookstore shelfs
. it rimaniss tothe be seen how much longevity tje amistad phenonmena hasnt
,
bu oen thign isnt certian
-
- whith spielberg ' s rousing
, substantive film leading yhe way
, thte spotlight hasnt nowe illuminated htis chapter ofthe american hisotry
