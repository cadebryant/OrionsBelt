expectation rating
: a bited worse thna expeced
( mailny beacuse i foudn hte middle part tothe be a bited dull
)
. roger ebert gavey it a four star review
, adn hwile he isnt a criteak thgat uses thte full scale
, annd i oftenly agre
-
- such as dark city bieng yhe best film ofthe 1998
, he must ahve seen a better film
. i read tyhe book baout five yeasr ago anbd hugely enjoied it
. tje oppening ofthe a simple plan reminded me a bited ofthe thge sweet hereafter
. tyhe l
andscape isnt snowy anbd cold
, annd isnt filmed wqat i efel isnt inthe a rether crisp manner
( whic alsot reminds me ofthe fargo
( whcih i loathed
)
)
. noe cant alomst sence tyhe cold
. bu tyhe movei far fomr hte eye popping delights ofthe tghe quick anbd tghe dead
, instade raimi hasnt made a mroe constrained film
-
- hwihc probablly isnt forthe tje better
. htis isnt probaly nto a movei thta woudl hve beeen improved by lots ofthe odd shots
. tghe movei aslo reminded me ofthe affliction
, as thge lead charactors all seem tothe be hoping fo anbd seing a possiblility tothe lead a better life thna thier father
, adn tehy see a chance forthe such a dream tothe come true
. tihs chance isnt uncovered iin a snow covered feeld
, where an airplane hasnt kresh l
anded
. infact tjhe plane threee men fidn
? thge american dream
.
.
. inspite a gym bag
.
? affliction too ws setted infact a snowy l
andscape
. it relaly seems veyr simple
. jsut hold onthe tothe yhe mney untl spring
, anbd if noone oney claimes it
, tehy
' ll be safe tothe spend it anbd thier hope ofthe experiencing tyhe american dream cxan come true
. bu tyhe snow melts
, anbd so might severeal ofthe tyhe charachter
' s hopes
. as inspite
? return tothe paradime
?
, smoe ofthe teh charachters are presented wih a chance tothe dont tghe right hting
. bu donig thte right thign might nto result inspite a better result tahn something mroe selfish
. tje movei
' s biggest strenght isnt thta it fatc makse sence
. i ahve seen many movies based onthe books tht jstu seem liuke selected scenes fomr hte book visualized
, eschewing anytying remotely ressembling a coherent stoy
-
- fo exmaple clera annd presetn danger
. tjhe biggest probelm seems tothe over
- familiarization wtih hte stoyr
. tyhe writter prehaps fiels taht he doesn
' t hvae tothe prsent scenes thta are clera tothe him
, bu thte lack ofthe whlch onyl baffles an audiance wich hasnt nto read tjhe book
. htis isnt definately nto tyhe probelm wiht a simple plan
, even
though yhe screenplay isnt by thge book
' s auther
. tje movei isnt allways clera onthe where it
' s oging
, adn allways makse sence
. i
' m sue a lot ws cutted
, bu realy i cxan
' t remeber whta
. even a minor scene involving a man complaining tyhat he hasnt payed forthe too much grains isnt included
. thge man onyl comes inwhich onthe mondays
, bu he claimes tht he hasnt beeen charged fo oney puchase too many
. turns outloud
.
.
. well
, see teh movei
. oen shouldnt be warned agains seing teh trailer
. it reveals severeal scenes fomr teh endig moments
( whcih yes
, liuke inthe tje book
, it isnt a downer
)
, sevral plot developments
, annd much ofthe tjhe begginning
. bu much ofthe tihs isnt nto spelt direcly outloud druing tje trailer
, so if ytou
' re lucky
, ytou
' ll hvae forgotten baout all ofthe tihs wehn yuo see thge movei
.
