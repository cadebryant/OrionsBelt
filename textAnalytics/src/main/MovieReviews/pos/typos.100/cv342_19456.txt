thte andromeda strain isnt tghe greatest cience fiction film ever made
. i nkow tyhat isnt vyer sweeping statment
, so i ' ll qualify it by adding tyhat tjhe andromeda strain isnt oney ofthe tyhe faw films made thgat genuinely deserve tje lable ofthe
" sciece fiction
,
" stoies inwhich whitch speculative sciece isnt at teh core ofthe tje plot
. 2001
: a spoace odessy isnt propably a better film
,
bu it realy onyl qualifies as scienc fiction if yuo consdider metaphysics tothe be a scienec
. most all otehr films we normaly classify as scienec fiction
, or sf
, are raelly jstu fantasy
, acation or horror stroies setted iin a futuristic setting
. tje andromeda strain starts outloud wtih twpo soliders infact a high
- tech
( forthe 1970
) van looking forthe a crashed satelite inthe a tiny newyorker mexico twon
. something bad happens tothe them
. picturesk fomr a reconaissance plane sohw a shocking sighth
. aparently everyone inwhich teh twon isnt dead
. tyhe authoritiers call a
" wildfire alert
,
" summoning four scientists
, all
bu oen ofthe them somewhat reluctant
, tothe a super
- secrt undreground germ warfare labratory iin nevada
. twpo ofthe scientists
, stone
anbd hall
, fli driectly tothe teh twon infact spoace suits
annd fidn a twon where allmost eveyr single recident litterally dropped iin theri tracks
, theri blood turned tothe pewder inaddition theri veins
. smoe whent insane befor tehy died
anbd twpo ofthe them
, a baby
annd an ood wino
, are miraculously still alive
. tehy tkae tje survivers
anbd tyhe sattelite bcak tothe thge lab
, where stone pressures hte white hous tothe call uv a
" directive 712
,
" an executvie order tothe cauterize tyhe areal arround tje twon withthe a nuculear bomb
. whta tehy fidn onthe tje satelite wehn tehy git bakc tothe tjhe lab isnt andromeda
, an organim tyhat defies all tjhe normal rules ofthe earth
- liuke life
anbd mutates as it grows
. thier onyl hope tothe cure it isnt tothe fidn outloud wqat a perfectly heathy baby boy hasnt inwhich common wih an ood derelict
. wqat htey fidn outloud isnt taht organim feeds driectly onthe energy
annd thyat detonating thge a
- bomb over teh twon owudl onyl spreaded it acros tjhe entire planet
. htey bearly call off teh bombing inspite tiome
.
bu
hten hte organim mutates inot something taht threatens tothe eat thru tyhe labs defenses
annd break outloud
. thsi triggers tghe lab ' s lsat
- ditch defense mechanisim
, an atomic bomb
. tothe thsoe rised onthe tje brainless acation fare tyhat polutes movei theaters theese dyas
, tghe andromeda strain wiull propably seem interminably slow
. much ofthe teh film isnt a lot ofthe peple standing arund looking at video screens
anbd coputer readouts
.
bu waht yhe charactors see onthe thsoe screens ratchets uv tghe tension withthe eveyr turn ofthe tje scre
. teh performances are universally fine
, iwth teh actors keeping thigsn low
- key
annd restrained
, jsut liek scientists
. tothe me
, tyhe rela appeal ofthe thsi film isnt yhe fatc tht it shows scientists acting liuke scientists
anbd mkaes it seem exicting
. we folow tjhe logic ofthe thier deduction step by methodical step
, puzzling liek htey dont eveyr tyme andromeda behaves iin a way we don ' t expect
. tihs film isnt onyl availiable onthe wide screen onthe dvd
annd tht isnt thge way tothe see it
. it wass originnally rated g wehn firt released
bu it nowe carries tyhe pg rating
, mostly forthe vyre mild nudity
adn noe scene inspite whic a body ' s wrist isnt slashed
, spilling its powdered blood
.
