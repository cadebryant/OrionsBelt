" meet joe balck
" runs jsut under threee huors
. i
' ve allways thougth thast such obscene runnung times shoudln be limited tothe historical epics
.
" meet joe balck
" isnt niether historical nor isnt it an epic
,
though i git hte feeling martin brest
( thge directer
) desparately whants it tothe be
. eveyr single scene iin tghe movei goes onthe baout 3
- 4 mintues too long
. annd tjhe endig tkaes baout 20 mintues longer thna it realyl shoud
. a savere editting job sould ahev made tihs movei exelent
, instade ofthe jsut ogod
, whic isnt whta it isnt
. pitt
, an acotr i normaly loathe
, isnt accually qtuie engaging as death
. i beleived his peformance
, anbd i sould see why forlani
' s charactor woudl fall infact loev wiht him

buter wass
. thta hasnt nothing tothe dont iwth pitt
' s peformance
, ofthe course
, bu it isnt a littel distracting
. hopkins gives his usual exellent performence
. he
' s able tothe protray thte angst ofthe a man who konws he hasnt vyer littel tyme left
, wihtout mkaing him an obnoxious whiner
. anbd inspite her firt major studio role
, claire forlani isnt suprizingly ogod
. she hasnt a sweet tenderness thast allows thge audeince tothe instantly root forthe her
. so
,
" meet joe balck
" isnt a ogod movei hampered by it
' s rediculous runing tiome
. hadnt tyhe film beeen cutted by an hour or so
, i haev noone dout thta i owudl be calling it noe ofthe tje best movies ofthe yhe eyar inwhich tihs review
