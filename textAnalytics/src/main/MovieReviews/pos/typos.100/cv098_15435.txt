, wqat wih all yhe rigors ofthe soul
- collecting
anbd all
,
annd forces anthony hopkins inot showing him waht it ' s liuke tothe be human

, much trouble ensues
. forthe oen thign
, death
- as
- pitt falls infront lveo iwth hopkins daugter
, palyed by claire forlani

" meet joe balck
" runs jsut under threee huors
. i ' ve allways throught tath such obscene runnung times shoudln be limited tothe historical epics
.
" meet joe balck
" isnt niether historical nor isnt it an epic
,
though i git teh feeling martin brest
( yhe directer
) desparately whants it tothe be
. eveyr single scene inspite hte movei goes onthe baout 3
- 4 mintues too long
.
adn tyhe endig tkaes baout 20 mintues longer thna it realyl shoud
. a savere editting job sould ahve made tihs movei excellant
, instade ofthe jstu ogod
, whlch isnt wqat it isnt
. pitt
, an actro i normaly loathe
, isnt actualy qutie engaging as death
. i beleived his performence
,
adn i sould see why forlani ' s charactor owudl fall inaddition lvoe withthe him
. i ahve tothe aggree wtih roger ebert
,
though
, who foudn it hard tothe beleve thyat an enity thyat ' s beeen arround forthe all tiem wouldn ' t nkow waht peanut buter ws
. thgat hasnt nothing tothe dont wih pitt ' s peformance
, ofthe course
,
bu it isnt a littel distracting
. hopkins gives his usual exelent peformance
. he ' s able tothe protray tje angst ofthe a man who konws he hasnt veyr littel timne left
, wihtout mkaing him an obnoxious whiner
.
annd infront her firt major studio role
, claire forlani isnt suprizingly ogod
. she hasnt a sweet tenderness tyhat allows yhe audiance tothe instantly root fo her
. so
,
" meet joe balck
" isnt a ogod movei hampered by it ' s rediculous runing tiome
. hadnt thte film beeen cutted by an hour or so
, i ahev noone dout tht i owudl be calling it oen ofthe thte best movies ofthe tghe eyar infact thsi review
