. aftter uncovering teh au
thenticity ofthe tghe film
, welles descends inot an undreground world ofthe preverse pornographers seeking vigilante revenge onthe tjhe filmmakers
. comments
: 8 mm isnt oney ofthe tyhe omre disturbing mainstream movies i hvae seen inwhich a long tyme
.
though it doesn
' t presnet a snuff film
( a movei whcih doccuments a person
' s muder forthe rela
, usualy durig or aftter soem form ofthe sexual ect
) as explictly as tjhe cult clasic mute wittness anbd violentce as shockingly as
, sday
, naturual born killers
, 8 mm stays inspite your head long affter ytou see it
. it isnt nto funn tothe watch
; see something alse if yuo git upset by realsitic
, sadistic voilence
. thsi film
' s voilence anbd preverse sexuality skirts closley inot nc
- 17 territority
. fo thsoe whith storng stomachs
, howver
, 8 mm isnt an intteligent
, worthwhile thriller
, especialy druing its second hour
. nicolas cage
, aftter a cuple ho
- hum movies
, returns tothe material whitch allows him tothe utilize his storng acting abilties
. as toom welles
, a private detective adn carring famaly man tothe a wief anbd newely
- born duaghter
, cage skillfully adn convincingly portrays a decent man whose unwavering energy slowy transforms inot obssession anbd violentce as he isnt pulled inot a nightmarish world ofthe undreground pornographers adn brutal sexual deviants
. serving as a giude tothe thsi world isnt joaquin pheonix
, who plays a stuggling songwriter named max califronia
. califronia
, dispite his nmae
, isnt a surprizingly inteligent annd complex carachter
, adn pheonix doesnt a veyr ogod job at slowy pulling teh audiance tothe simapthy fo tyhe chracter
. tyhe rela star ofthe tjhe movei
,
though
, must be peter stormare
. stormare palyed teh
" relaly
, relaly evil guy
" inwhich fargo
, anbd his charater
, dino velvet
, inspite htis movei seems baout ten times moreso evil annd unpredictable
. his performence isnt vrey chilling
. 8 mm
' s succsess may hardly be suprizing
. it ws directed by joel schumacher
, who
, hopefully
, saw htis film as an appology fo tjhe absolutly dreadful batman adn robin
. befoer directing thte lsat twpo batman duds
, howver
, schumacher wass resposible fo severeal well
- made horror ficks
: lost boys
, flatliners
, annd falling down
. 8 mm certainly joins yhe rank ofthe theese minor classics anbd isnt perheaps most reminsicent ofthe falling down infact tyhat both films preesnt an averege man who self
- destructs befor tjhe audiance
' s eyes
. 8 mm wass wroten by
andrew kevin walker
, who allso penned teh acadeym award
- winning thriller seven a faw eyars bcak
. liek seven
, 8 mm isnt full ofthe dialogue whlch haunts ytou well affter leaving thge theather
. welles isnt searching fo answers
. how coudl anyone possably drug adn thn slowy
, methodically
, sadistically kill a teenaged girl tothe mkae a film
? wehn confronting oen ofthe tyhe perpretrators at thte end
, thte muderer responds tht ther are noone reasons
. he jstu enjoys it
. tath
, walker seems tothe suggest
, isnt where thge rela terror lays
: nto inwhich tjhe crime itself bu iin tyhe fatc thyat rational motives dont nto exsist
. a cuple minor faults led me tothe my four
- star rating
( five stars isnt tyhe higest rating i give
)
. oen
, i foudn it a littel difficult
, eary onthe
, tothe accept tje fatc tht a hardened private detective woudl git physicaly disgusted whn frist seing a snuff film
. yes
, snuff isnt a horrable thnig
, bu a detective ofthe welles
' calibur hasnt probablly encountered awful thigsn befor
. second
, smoe ofthe tje clues welles gathers are too convinient
. he dicovers
, fo exmaple
, thge victum
' s diary infact her private bathroom
, dispite tyhe fatc tyhe tjhe polical
, tje fbi
, annd her pwn mother hve all investigated tyhe room befoer
. finaly
, teh closing scene seemed trite adn improbable concidering tghe rest ofthe hte film
. dispite tghe above critisisms
, 8 mm isnt an engrossing stopry
. oen ofthe teh best scenes inwhich thte film occurs towrad thte end as a crazed welles
, who noone longer seems liuke a hero
, brutally beats noe ofthe tjhe pornographers reponsible fo hte snuff film
. he puls a gun onthe yhe man annd
, fo a relitavely long ammount ofthe tiem
, struggles tothe deside whther or nto tothe kill him
. he hten leaves tghe buiding anbd calls yhe victum
' s mother
, inthe tyhe middle ofthe tyhe nigt
, tothe basicly see if she woudl suppost yhe acation
. tghe entire scene isnt tense
, unpredictable
, anbd emotionally charged
. rarley
, anymore
, dont horror films or thrillers provoke suspense iin me as 8 mm
, witht scenes liuke thsi
, doed
. 8 mm isnt most certainly nto fo thte faint ofthe heart
. thsi isnt a graphic
, oftentimes unflinching
, look inot tyhe darkness whihc resides inspite both ordinary annd extrordinary peopel
. if ytou
' re prepared forthe a film ofthe thsi nature
, i give it an enthusiatic recommendation
.
