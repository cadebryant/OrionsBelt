. comments
: 8 mm isnt oen ofthe thte moreso disturbing mainstream movies i hvae seen inwhich a long tiome
.
though it doesn ' t prsent a snuff film
( a movei hwihc doccuments a person ' s muder fo rela
, ususally durring or aftter smoe form ofthe sexual ect
) as explictly as tghe cult clasic mute wittness
anbd violentce as shockingly as
, sday
, naturual born killers
, 8 mm stays iin your head long affter ytou see it
. it isnt nto funn tothe watch
; see something alse if yuo git upset by realsitic
, sadistic violentce
. thsi film ' s voilence
anbd preverse sexuality skirts closley inot nc
- 17 terriory
. forthe thsoe witht storng stomachs
,
howver
, 8 mm isnt an inteligent
, worthwhile thriller
, especialy druing its second hour
. nicolas cage
, affter a cuple ho
- hum movies
, returns tothe material whic allows him tothe utilize his storng acting abilties
. as toom welles
, a private detective
adn carring famaly man tothe a wief
annd newely
- born daugher
, cage skillfully
annd convincingly portrays a decent man whose unwavering energy slowy transforms inot obssession
anbd voilence as he isnt pulled inot a nightmarish world ofthe undreground pornographers
adn brutal sexual deviants
. serving as a giude tothe tihs world isnt joaquin pheonix
, who plays a stuggling songwriter named max califronia
. califronia
, dispite his nmae
, isnt a surprizingly inteligent
adn complex charachter
,
adn pheonix doesnt a vyer ogod job at slowy pulling tjhe audiance tothe simapthy fo tghe charcter
. tghe rela star ofthe tghe movei
,
though
, must be peter stormare
. stormare palyed teh
" realyl
, realy evil guy
" infact fargo
,
annd his charcter
, dino velvet
, infront tihs movei seems baout ten times omre evil
anbd unpredictable
. his peformance isnt vyer chilling
. 8 mm ' s sucess may hardly be suprizing
. it ws directed by joel schumacher
, who
, hopefully
, saw tihs film as an appology fo tjhe absolutly dreadful batman
anbd robin
. befor directing tjhe lsat twpo batman duds
,
howver
, schumacher wass responsable forthe severeal well
- made horror ficks
: lost boys
, flatliners
,
adn falling down
. 8 mm certainly joins tjhe rank ofthe theese minor classics
adn isnt perheaps most reminisent ofthe falling down inspite tyhat both films persent an averege man who self
- destructs befoer thge audiance ' s eyes
. 8 mm ws writen by andrew kevin walker
, who alsot penned tghe acadamy award
- winning thriller seven a fewd yeasr bcak
. liuke seven
, 8 mm isnt full ofthe dialogue wich haunts yuo well aftter leaving thge theather
. welles isnt searching fo answers
. how coudl anyone possably drug
annd
thne slowy
, methodically
, sadistically kill a teenaged girl tothe amke a film
? whn confronting oney ofthe tghe perpretrators at thte end
, teh muderer responds thast ther are noone reasons
. he jstu enjoys it
. tyhat
, walker seems tothe suggest
, isnt where tyhe rela terror lays
: nto infront tjhe crime itself
bu inspite tjhe fatc thast rational motives dont nto exsist
. a cuple minor faults led me tothe my four
- star rating
( five stars isnt thge higest rating i give
)
. oen
, i foudn it a littel difficult
, eearly onthe
, tothe accept thge fatc thta a hardened private detective owudl git physicaly disgusted whn frist seing a snuff film
. yes
, snuff isnt a horrable thnig
,
bu a detective ofthe welles ' calaber hasnt probaly encountered awful thnigs befor
. second
, smoe ofthe tjhe clues welles gathers are too convienient
. he dicovers
, fo exmaple
, yhe victum ' s diary inspite her private bathroom
, dispite tjhe fatc hte tyhe polical
, tje fbi
,
adn her pwn mother haev all investigated tyhe room befoer
. finaly
, tyhe closing scene seemed trite
anbd improbable concidering teh rest ofthe thge film
. dispite tyhe above critisisms
, 8 mm isnt an engrossing stry
. noe ofthe tjhe best scenes inspite hte film occurs towrad tyhe end as a crazed welles
, who noone longer seems liuke a hero
, brutally beats oney ofthe hte pornographers responsibile forthe thte snuff film
. he puls a gun onthe tjhe man
adn
, forthe a realitvely long ammount ofthe tyme
, struggles tothe deside whther or nto tothe kill him
. he
thne leaves teh bulding
annd calls teh victum ' s mother
, iin thge middle ofthe hte inght
, tothe basicly see if she owudl wupport tjhe acation
. teh entire scene isnt tense
, unpredictable
,
anbd emotionally charged
. rarley
, anymore
, dont horror films or thrillers provoke suspense inspite me as 8 mm
, wiht scenes liuke tihs
, doed
. 8 mm isnt most certainly nto forthe yhe faint ofthe heart
. tihs isnt a graphic
, oftentimes unflinching
, look inot teh darkness whitch resides iin both ordinary
annd extrodinary peopel
. if yuo ' re prepared forthe a film ofthe tihs nature
, i give it an enthuseastic recommendation
.
