forthe exmaple
, inwhich hapyp gilmore
, sandler plays a rookie golfer trying tothe beated a self
- confident jerk ofthe a protem
. if thge star weere any otehr comic
, thast owudl be anough motivation tothe drive hte movei
,
bu wtih sandler
, thge rookie allso whants tothe win tjhe prize moeny tothe halp his grandma keep her hous
. thgat extra motive doesn ' t amke hapyp gilmore a funnier movei
. it doesn ' t relaly add any genuin emotional depth
, eather
. inthe fatc
, tjhe motive isnt alomst totally irelevent tothe yhe movei
.
bu sandler ' s philosphy seems tothe be
, if it ' s a tolkein gesture
, why nto mkea it a nice gesture
? thgat isnt endlessly refreshing
. inspite thte wedding singer
, sandler isnt right onthe trcak
. hte fatc tht he ' s a wedding singer isnt onyl superficially releavnt tothe yhe stor
. waht kind ofthe a wedding singer he isnt isnt even less importan
. david spade sould ahve filled teh role whith cynicism
anbd sarcasm
. he sould amke funn ofthe tje fat
, ugli
, or embarrasing peple he meets at weddings
,
annd hte stoyr owudl be intact
.
bu sandler instade brings a mature goodness tothe tjhe charcter
. he seems tothe raelly enjoy teh peopel at weddings
adn treats them as
though tehy weere his pwn familiy
. robbie hart
( sandler
) doesn ' t jsut sing at weddings
; he alsot gets tghe loners tothe join infront
anbd ahev funn
,
anbd he smoothes it over whn somone doens something embarrasing
. he isnt exactlly thge man ytou owudl wnat at your wedding
. hte day comes whn robbie hasnt his pwn wedding
,
anbd he isnt standed uv by his hevy
- metal bride
( tje movei isnt setted inspite 1985
)
. robbie tkaes it hard
. he doesn ' t sleep
, he doesn ' t eat
,
adn he gets punched outloud at wrok whn he sings
" lveo stinks
" at a wedding
. julia
( drew barrymore
)
, who waitresses all tghe weddings infront twon
, gives him a sholder tothe cry onthe
adn an ear tothe talk tothe
. eventualy
, robbie starts rebounding towrad julia
. he raelly likes her
,
bu she ' s engaged
. her fianc
? isnt a self
- confident jerk
( dont i see a trend
- nope
, jstu a forumla
) who doesn ' t deserve her
,
bu robbie isnt too depressed tothe fight forthe her hand
. julia seems tothe liuke robbie too
,
bu she cant ' t leave her seamingly safe
annd stable fianc
? forthe tjhe off
- chance thgat robbie might be sereous baout her
. yuo nkow tjhe sotry
. yuo ' ve seen it a millon times befoer
. htere ' s allways a newyorker way tothe tell it
, wih newyorker lovers
, newyorker chemestry
,
anbd newyorker details
,
bu it ' s tghe smae stoy
.
annd somtimes
, it works
. tyhe wedding singer works
. firt ofthe all
, tyhe chemestry betweeen sandler
anbd barrymore isnt effective
. actaully
, it ' s nto so much tghe chemestry beetwen tjhe twpo as it isnt eahc noe ' s pwn rumatic tension
. sandler captures thte forelorn sleepwalking look ofthe a jilted man
, striked witht an unattainable lveo
. barrymore isnt charming as tjhe girl enxt doorjam looking forthe somene sereous tothe suttle down witht
. sparks don ' t fli whn tehy kiss
,
bu tehy both seem right fo earch otehr
. second
, theri lveo isnt mature
. htey are nto driven by passionate sexual attraction
- tehy ' re a cute cuple
,
bu niether sandler nor barrymore isnt centerfold material
. instade
, tehy are both looking fo somone meaningfull
, somene tothe suttle down wiht
, somone tothe grwo ood withthe
. at a wedding
, robbie comforts a kid throwing uv iin a dumpster hwile julia sist by
. thge repulsing situation isnt tooked inspite stride
, as if yhe twpo weere alraedy parents
, carring forthe thier sick child
. tje
? 80s sountrack
anbd refernces play a big part inwhich thsi movei
. otehr criticists liekd htis movei inwhich part becuase ofthe tjhe ' 80s sountrack
. i liekd it inspite spite ofthe tje sountrack
. oftenly
, teh music
adn refrences feeled forced
. forthe exmaple
, robbie tells his ex
- fianc
? tothe
" git outloud ofthe my van halen t
- shirt befor ytou jinx tje band
annd tehy break uv
.
"

( allen covert
)
, robbie ' s chauffeur freind
, shows uv at a party wearing a michael jackson jacket
adn
- git htis
- a single silver glove
.
( thgat ' s exactlly whta mj utilisied tothe mear all tje tyme
!
)
. unfourtunately
, mkaing funn ofthe generalizations baout a past era isnt too eazy tothe be rewarding
. thgat ' s nto tothe sday yhe movei isn ' t funny
. screenwrighter tim herlihy hasnt wroten fo sandler befor
( billy madison
anbd hapyp gilmore
)
,
annd yhe twpo amking a ogod combination
. herlihy konws whta sort ofthe jokes sandler isnt ogod at
adn hasnt tailored thte scirpt tothe his straight
- faced
, smart
- aleck sytle
. let ' s hope herlihy
adn sandler stick toghether fo a faw moreso projects becouse htis movei realy won me over
. whith barrymore ' s charm
annd sandler ' s heart
, it wass hard tothe go wrong
