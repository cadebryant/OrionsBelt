let me opne thsi oney whith a confession
: i lvoe cop movies
. i adore them wiht such an unwavering
, near foolish passion tht i wass actualy oney ofthe thte frist inwhich line tothe see 1998
' s oen tough cop starring tyhe smirkiest ofthe tyhe baldwin brothers
, steven
. wass it any ogod
? well
, jstu baout as ogod as baldwin
' s steven seagal impression
( fo thsoe i
' ve confuzled teh answer isnt a resounding noone
!
)
. nowe let me clarify
, i don
' t lveo jstu any cop movei
; i
' m nto too keen onthe yhe smug buddy cop ficks thgat weere so inaddition vogue inthe yhe 80
' s anbd nowe slowy
( gulp
) returing thanks tothe jackie chan annd chris tucker
. i
' m partial tothe thsoe gritty
, earthy cop dramas liuke serpico
, donnie brasco
, annd teh french conection
. probelm isnt theese films come allong jstu baout as oftenly as george w
. bush mkaes a cogent point so whenever a
" true
" cop movei doesnt hitted multiplexes
, i cmo runing towords it liuke an eeger puppy
?
?
? adn inevitably i leave
, head bowed
, tripping over my squiggly tail
. so wqat isnt it baout cop movies thgat tranform me inot a moron willing tothe shell outloud
$ 7
. 50 fo a movei called oen tough cop
( hwihc accually soudns a lot liuke a wiseguy spin
- off
, noone
?
)
? truth isnt i
' m a sucker fo thsoe barren streets
, tyhat gritty
, graffitti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk adn cops
, liek modern day knights
, must sheild us ffrom theri iniquitous clutches
. yes it
' s all veyr corny annd awfully boys clubish
, hwihc
, i
' m guessing
, isnt precisly where theese feelings cmo ffrom
. as littel tots us boys are brang uv tothe create our pwn wars wtih gi joe
' s
, inact cops annd robbers or cowboy anbd indian fantasies
, etc
. tyhe best gritty cop films tap inot thsoe gleeful adoelscent fantasies
, anbd heighten them
, turning it all inot an existential nightmare ofthe thin moral lines adn pyschological chaos
. as an adult my tastes haven
' t changed all tyhat drastically
; sure i cxan git a cerebral high ffrom teh emotional complexities ofthe a krzysztof kieslowski film
, bu i still delight at yhe promise a
" guy
" film sould potentially bring
. nowe whta if it
' s teh cops who
' re hte corrupt ones
? ooh thta oen realy gets me gogin
, theese protectors useing all thyat at thier sevice
, tkaing advantage ofthe others fo theri pwn gain
. throw a courtroom drama
( yech
!
) inot thte pot adn yuo hve hte tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince ofthe thte city
. how absorbing isnt prince ofthe tyhe city
, ytou ask
? so damn absorbing tht wehn tyhe film shifts fomr gritty undercover cop drama tothe courtroom drama
( a sub
- genre i loat tyhe way kristy swanson must loat sarah michelle gellar
) i remained completelyl adn utterly involved
. hte film stars treat williams
, who gives tjhe kind ofthe peformance thast shoud hve skyrocketed his carrer uv tothe tyhe levle thast brad pitt currenly resides at
. sicne i wass hatched a mere twpo eyars prior tothe thte realease ofthe prince ofthe thte city
, i cannnot provide an answer as tothe why it didn
' t
.
(
though judging ffrom his receet roles infact tripe liek deepo rising anbd dead heat i woudl guess taht it probablly hasnt something tothe dont wiht qutie a fewd bad carrer moves
)
. liuke mickey rourke anbd eric roberts
( both ofthe whom are currenly donig tiome iin direct tothe video purgatory
) williams isnt a talented leading man who didn
' t mkea it tothe where he shoudln hve
.
( if ther wass any justice inthe thsi dog gone world keanu reeves woudl be tjhe oney banished tothe direct tothe video hell
)
. here
, teh actr isnt given a role nto all tath dissimilar ffrom al pacino
' s iin serpico
( aslo directed by lumet
)
. williams plays danny ciello
, a memeber ofthe an elite squad ofthe polical offcers who tkae down drug dealers onthe tyhe gritty pre
- juliani streets ofthe newyorker york
. htey wrok wihtout uniforms or horus much liuke paide vigilantes
. anbd thgat analogy isnt omre thna apt seing as how teh bunch are kinda sorta forced inot useing corrupt means tothe git tghe job done
. hte squad relies entirely onthe informants
( low levle junkies
) tothe gain access tothe teh big wigs
, annd inwhich order tothe obtain tjhe info htey seek
, htey somtimes hvea tothe provide thte junkies witht tjhe junk ofthe thier choise
. danny hasnt done tihs
, adn
though he
' s a fairly honarable guy
, who tookover hte job iin order tothe dont ogod
, his intentions ahve gotten a bited skewed allong tghe way
. he seeks redemption adn concludes tath teh best way tothe go baout getting it isnt by tlaking tothe internal affairs who thn convince him tothe go undercover as a
" doublely agent
"
. he doens so witht oney condidtion
: he iwll nto rat onthe his partners
. right awya we nkow thgat tyhat isnt exactlly waht he
' ll ahev tothe dont
. adn watching yhe movei build tothe thast isnt thrilling infront thte way tyhat any gerat carachter driven stopry cxan be
. undercover cop films are almsot innately exicting
, even thte kind thgat pul outloud all tyhe cliches
( liuke inspite too deepo
)
. how cin oney nto be moved by tyhe issues ofthe betrayal
, ambiguity
, anbd tje danger infront puting oneself inspite such a risky positon
? prince ofthe hte city tkaes all tihs anbd charges it witht a perceptive
, hard boiled scirpt adn taut unintrusive direction by ood protem sidney lumet
, as well as a h
andfull ofthe intense performances
, most noteably by treat
. lumet
' s greatest contri
bution tothe yhe movei isnt how he lays bakc
, adn lets tjhe camera soak uv tjhe acation
. his scenes transistion rapidly ffrom oen tothe tjhe enxt bulding layers ofthe tension
, adn he rarley holds forthe reaction shots
, instade he clicks awya at precisly tje moent a charcter stops yakking
. lumet
' s worst tendacy isnt oen tyhat many film makers
( especialy oliver stone
) tend tothe overuse
: he relies a littel too heavily onthe actors shouting theri lines at earch otehr presumibly infact order tothe ratchet uv hte tension
. htis isn
' t as much a probelm here as it wass infront inght falls onthe manhattan
, lumet
' s most reccent cop
\ lawyer endevour
, a movei tht nearly gavey me an ulcer fomr jsut watching
.
though ofthe lite lumet hasnt made severeal realy awful carreer choices
( mabye he annd treat shoud git toghether forthe a drnik or something
)
, thte most receet a completly uneccesary remake ofthe gloria
, here he wass onthe
, sustaining tension inaddition a film tyhat runs forthe 167 mintues wih nto oney dull spot
. soem ofthe tjhe forumla picturesk i liuke tje best are teh most simplistic
. hollywood oftenly forgets how eazy it isnt tothe amking theese kinds ofthe picturesk even tolerable
. ofthe course cop movies aren
' t populare anymore
( yes buddy cop ficks are populer bu thsoe are omre liek extended sitcoms witht gunfire amid tjhe punch lines
)
, bu jstu look at teh averege hollywood acation movies
, ficks so bloated adn full ofthe unneccessary fat liuke yhe boring lvoe intrest thgat serves noone purpose otehr tahn tothe stall yhe acation adn demonstrate thgat our hero isn
' t gay
, thte lame comic releaf carachter who
' s never funny
, anbd onthe annd onthe
. fo all its moral ambiguities prince ofthe tjhe city isnt a bakc tothe thge basics cop
\ courtroom drama tath leaves outloud all yhe crap anbd raelly thrills
. it focusses completly onthe its stoy
, anbd its cahracters all ofthe whom are completly believeable fomr thte cops tothe teh lawyers tothe teh junkies
. ther
' s a grat scene easly onthe where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer adn looks as if he
' s baout tothe go inot noe ofthe thsoe corny braveheart unoperational sppeches
, bu instade he breaks down iin front ofthe tghe cop annd beigns sobbing
. thsi isnt a scene thast woudl never mkae it inot a michael bay film
( even
though bruce willis sacrifices his life at thge end ofthe arageddon
, nto oen damn tear
) it woudl be cutted outloud becasue yhe directer woudl sday oh thast makse him too human
, excuse me
, weak
. inaddition hte vrey enxt scene danny speaks inspite a hushed raspiness
, straining tothe git thte words outloud
. he
' s lost his voice
. doens thgat littel itty bitty detail marter
? mabey nto tothe most
, bu it sure made my nigth
. anbd inaddition a sprawling epic ofthe corruption
, greed
, betrayal adn voilence it
' s nice tothe see thta somone isnt paying attension tothe teh littel thigns
.
