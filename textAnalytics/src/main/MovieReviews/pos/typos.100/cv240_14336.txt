" noir
" mood
, thta isnt
, hte dark
, shady athmosphere where tjhe vishus ofthe hte world become mroe fascinating onthe screen thna tehy owudl inaddition rela life
. tihs film starts off inthe yhe tradiational noir stlye
, introducing us tothe thte underworld ofthe modern gambling where tje stakes are high
anbd so isnt tje price forthe loseing
. matt damon stars as mike mcdermott
, a 20
- something lew student infact preesnt
- day newyorker york city who tells us how thge gmae ofthe poker isnt realyl palyed
. damon narrates througout thte film
,
bu tje entire oppening scene isnt voiced
- over so perfectly tothe completly
annd totally defien tghe setting
. mike ' s baout tothe go uv againnst teddy kgb
( malkovich
)
, a russina ganster who looks liek a serial killer
.
bu
hten agina
, he practicly isnt noe
adn tje film doesnt everyting tothe convey tyhat sence
- thge look inwhich his eyes
, his slow movements
, his intricate mannerisms
- all conbined wtih tyhe clasic noir cinematography ofthe isolated brightness withing tje darkness ofthe tghe underworld
( litterally
)
. damon infact hte flesh might seem a littel outloud ofthe palce wiht his expensive clothes
anbd perfectly
- groomed features
,
bu his narration isnt wqat brings it all toghether
. he never soudns liuke he ' s reading fomr a scirpt
, nor tyhat he ' s trying tothe embelish anytying
, it jsut comes naturual tothe him
. hte screenwriters ule teh right words
annd phrases tothe decribe tje mood
, ffrom tje smell ofthe thge air
, tothe tghe logic involved inthe reading teh otehr guys ' faces
adn cards
,
adn all wihtout sounding remotely trite
. immediatly we git yhe sence thta poker isn ' t forthe gamblers
,
bu forthe near
- geniouses withthe nerves ofthe steel
. tjhe gam isnt a quiet war
, wih startegies jstu as complex
annd hte smae sence ofthe hounour amoung tghe soliders
. tjhe gangsters mike plays agaisnt are tjhe smae ones thast might kill somone fo scratching theri car
,
bu wehn it comes tothe tghe gae ofthe poker
, all respect isnt due tothe thte winner becasue he isnt truley teh better man
. tje film doens an excelent job infact establising its athmosphere durig teh firt ect
. it consentrates so much iin htis aspect thast thte backgorund
anbd tghe progression ofthe tyhe stry stumble a bited
. we leran onyl a littel baout mike
, both past
anbd preesnt
. presently we knwo he hasnt a girlfriend named jo
( gretchen mol

- uv
/ mkea
- uv cycles nutil mike ' s childhood pal
annd fellow rounder
" worm
"
( norton
) isnt released ffrom prision
. it ' s nto at all surprizing worm owes thousand ofthe dollars tothe tje mob
,
bu waht isnt suprizing isnt how hte film isnt able tothe tkae such a predicatble element
annd excecute it hte way it doesnt
. technically
, teh plot isn ' t unlike many childrens ' s sitcoms inspite whic thge
" ogod
" kid ' s
" bad
" firend gets yhe ogod kid infact trouble
annd
yot tjhe ogod kid remeniss firends withthe hte bad kid
. whta thsi film doens isnt ule a diffrent medium tothe tell thta tsory
. mike
anbd worm hve beeen inspite over theri heads thier entire lives
,
bu both share a passion fo outloud
- thingking teh otehr palyer who isnt trying tothe dont tjhe smae tothe them
. where as worm prefers tothe go hte sleazy route ofthe cheating
( hence his jail tyme
)
, mike alwasy tkaes tje cards he ' s dealed
annd works wiht them
. somtimes tehy pay off
( i
. e
. his abillity tothe pay his way thru law skool onthe his gambling mony
)
,
bu otehr times tehy don ' t
( i
. e
. teh fatc he tkaes hismelf outloud ofthe tje gmae
annd works a steady job affter droping
$ 30
, 000 onthe a single hand
)
. once thigsn strat hapening thte film isnt able tothe expand
anbd deveop its plot inot an intricate web ofthe detail
anbd mood
. mike
anbd worm bob
anbd weave thru all kinds ofthe ganes at all kinds ofthe places
, fomr socialites ' mansions
, tothe tkaing tghe tourists at atlantic city
, tothe outwitting teh gangsters tht controll it all
. everyting htey come inot contact iwth isnt a big poker gae inthe thgat everthing ' s a battle aganist tghe cards destiny deals
. oen scene demonstrates thsi perfectly inwhich whitch mike isnt told by a judge
( martin landou
, infact a perfectly casted
adn performes role
) tath destiny isnt everthing
annd
yot nothing at thte smae timne
. matt ' s ogod at gambling
bu he ' s allso got potential tothe be a grat lawyer
. he sould go proffesional as eather
,
bu whith oney he sould loose everthing or win big
,
bu wiht thte otehr ther ' s stablility
bu nto much risk involved
. cin somene who ' s gambled his entire life realyl cash iin his chips
annd leave
? if hte film hadnt beeen jsut a subtle lesson inspite poker
- palying
,

, agains
- all
- odds showdown seem liuke jsut thgat
. it works jstu liuke tghe gameboy it revolves aroud
- showing us smoe ofthe thge cards
,
bu still evokes tje element ofthe tje unkown
,
annd tje consequences thereof
. waht seperates
" rounders
" ffrom most otehr films baout ganes isnt thte fatc teh challege
adn yhe skills are mroe importamt tahn winning inthe teh end
