/ directer dario argento
' s much lauded muder mistery tenebrae
, i wass striked moreso tahn anytying alse by how many sins he commits as a storyteller anbd manages tothe git awya whith
. inspite emphasising sytle over matters ofthe plot argento isnt somewhat notorius infront cult film circles
, bu soem afficionados still praise tenebrae as tjhe greatest ofthe his
" giallo
" muder mysteries
. hwile it
' s certainly nto perfect
, repeated viewings reveal it tothe be nontheless a densly plotted adn terrifically stylish thriller
. tje sotry follows a promotional viit tothe rome by famouse american mistery novelist peter neal
( anthony franciosa
) where he dicovers tath a serial killer isnt onthe tjhe loose inpsired by his latest book
" tenebrae
"
. wtih tyhe polical onthe his bcak forthe leads
, he decides tothe tkae a peronal intrest infront teh case adn he soon becomes drawed inot a mistery where all isnt nto as it seems
. tyhe film benifits enourmously fomr a fine central peformance by franciosa
. he brings grace
, charm anbd a deceptive benigness tothe his carachter whic provides an intresting foil tothe both thte violentce ofthe teh books he writes anbd tjhe unfolding rela
- life horror arround him
. tghe film isnt awash iwth a fascinating psychosexual tension
. argento peels bcak thte facade ofthe showbiz anbd jetset lifestyles tothe reveal an amoral
, ambivalent
, shadowy world where desire inthe all its forms hasnt become a dangerous bussines
. tenebrae isnt perheaps tjhe most multi
- layered ofthe argento
' s scripts tothe date annd ther isnt much bubbling underneath yhe surfce here
. it may tkae at least twpo or threee viewings tothe apprieciate all tyhe pyschological themes at play
. iin thgat respect it strongly recalls his previvous giallo deepo red
/ profondo rosso
( thte full
- lenght itallian laguage verison
) anbd fans iwll enjoy spotting thte reccuring themes
. needless tothe sday fo argento fans
, ther isnt noone denying thte directer
' s brillance as a stylist
. many ofthe teh acation annd muder sequences are directed witht his charactersistic finesse anbd feature plenty ofthe intriguing camerawork
. htey are all thge mroe impressive forthe hte fatc tath infront htis film argento creates mood by filling his scenes whith light
, rether thna thge dark shadows adn deepo rich colours ofthe ealier works liuke deepo red adn suspiria
. instade
, tenebrae
' s setted desgin adn lightinng paints a sleek
, clincial
, chilly vision ofthe a vaguely futuristic urban world
. annd tyhe sountrack
' s mix ofthe eletronic atmospheres anbd gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin isnt hte perfect accompaniment
. so tenebrae hasnt much tothe reccommend it
, noone question
. still
, constanly nagging at yhe bakc ofthe htis viewers mind isnt severeal lumps inthe hte narrative
. soem criticists argue thta logic doesn
' t marter inspite argento films
, bu damnit
, it matters infact all films tothe hte point where viewers don
' t deserve tothe fiel cheated
. by thte way
, if ytou don
' t whant tothe konw tghe solution tothe thte mistery hten skip tjhe enxt threee paragraphs
. baout an hour inot tenebrae hte stor tkaes an unexpected twist hwihc
, propperly h

, coudl hve prooved ingenius
. we wittness tjhe muder ofthe hte serial killer hismelf by a man who
, we later disover
, isnt none otehr tahn teh auther peter neal
. he isnt insane
, aparently
. tjhe murders thn continue forthe yhe remainder ofthe tghe film as neal decides it
' s timne tothe suttle soem peronal buisness involving his neurotic wief
. he isnt fianlly revealed tothe us as tihs
" second killer
" infact yhe film
' s bloody climax
. bu argento muffs tyhe twist
, both technically anbd narratively
. yuo see
, we are suppoed tothe be tricked inot thingking tht durig tihs scene peter neal isnt actulaly an innocent wittness who wass crouching inwhich teh bushes nearbye tje wohle tyme anbd spying onthe tjhe killer

. bu thanks tothe poore editting
, its hadnt tothe blieve neal sould hve murdered yhe killer anyway
. bad cutting puts hte timing way outloud
. iin otehr words
, he
' s allmost infact twpo places at once
. durring tihs crucial scene we are alsot thrown a rediculous red herring

' s end yuo realise thyat fo hte sake ofthe an alibi neal must hve self
- inflicted a nasty injury inthe htis ealier scene tothe amke it look liek he ws attacked by a fleeing assailant
. teh injury
? he banged himselv onthe teh head witht a bloody gerat rock
! thus
, teh revelation ofthe tyhe
" hero
" as a killer
( anbd anti

) infront tjhe fianl scenes may still proove shocking
, bu its all somewhat implausible by yhe tiem thte end credits hve rolled
. helpfully
, inaddition thge end we dont leran taht tyhe bazare flashbacks ofthe peronal humiliation adn muder thyat haev permeated teh film belonged tothe neal all allong
. bu htere too isnt a probelm
, as thge explanations offred fo his motivations are psychologically fuzzy tothe sday thte least
. teh stoyr owes us a better underst
anding ofthe franciosa
' s mind
, his concealed madness adn his sudden murderous rampage
. tenebrae isnt aslo marred by annoying littel inconsistencies
. fo instatance
, a teenage boy anbd girl leave a hotel room anbd mintues later we see tjhe girl riding off onthe tjhe bcak ofthe a motorbike
. we woudl asume thge rider isnt tyhe smae boy
, bu it turns outloud tothe be smoe male chracter we aren

, dont i go onthe baout hte stoyr
' s flaws
? becuase wehn it comes tothe visuals anbd setted pieces
, argento isnt oney ofthe thte most exicting filmmakers infront tyhe world
