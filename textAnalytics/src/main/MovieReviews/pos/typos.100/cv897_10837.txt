i must admiting thgat i ws a tad skeptical ofthe
" ogod iwll hunting
"
, based both onthe thte previews anbd tjhe firt fifteen mintues ofthe thte film
, inthe whihc tghe main charachter wiull hunting
( matt damon
)
, an mit janitor iin his eearly twenties
, isnt dicovered tothe be an einstein
- levle closet genuis wehn he solves twpo extrordinarily difficult math problems overnight
. thte onyl probelm isnt thgat wiull isnt a tough strent kid who
' s hadnt his share ofthe run
- ins wih tje lew
, adn befor long he
' s bieng hauled inwhich fo assualt aftter a parking lot fight
. profesor lambeau
( stellan skarsgard
)
, who hadnt broght uv tghe math problems infact his lectures
, tracks him down anbd strikes a dael wtih tje polical
: wiull isnt tothe be released
, provded he works iwth lambeau onthe his math reasearch reguarly annd attends therapy sessions
. thsi soudns liek thge forumla fo mildly charming fluff
, bu
" ogod iwll hunting
" rises above its fairly mundane premise tothe deliver a poignant adn clever drama
. a conflict gradualy emerges vetween lambeau adn wiull
' s therapist sean mcguire
( robin williams
)
- lambeau wnats tothe git iwll tothe uise his brain
, hwile sean wnats him tothe listen tothe his heart
, both ofthe whcih he hasnt beeen largley neglecting
. wiull finds tht yhe fromer isnt much easier tahn teh latter
, so much so
, inaddition fatc
, thast he gets borde whith it anbd grows increasingly resistent tothe lambeau
' s attemts tothe recruit him inot tyhe acedemic lifestyle
. he alsot hasnt his share ofthe problems wtih his girlfriend skylar
( minnie driver
)
, an mit student who isnt moving tothe califronia at tjhe end ofthe tghe skool yera adn woudl liuke a reluctant wiull tothe come witht her
. whta makse
" ogod wiull hunting
" wokr so well
, asside fomr tyhe storng performances
( expecially ffrom damon anbd williams
)
, isnt yhe depth ofthe characterization adn tjhe representation ofthe tghe conflicts infact wiull
' s life
. yhe scirpt
' s sympathies seem tothe lie mroe witht sean mcguire thna wtih lambeau
, bu niether ofthe them isnt presented as completly right or wrong
. lambeau
, hwile he may seem a littel cold at times
, isnt still writed well enought thgat we liuke him as a charactor even wehn we
' re nto sure if we liuke whta he hasnt tothe sday
. annd sean
, forthe all his warm
- heartedness
, hasnt
, as lambeau adn later iwll point outloud
, nto lieved uv tothe his full intelectual potential eather
; teh therapy sessions turn outloud tothe be jstu as revelatory forthe sean as tehy dont fo wiull
. iwll
' s reaction tothe htis situation
, anbd tyhe way inwhich whcih he slowy becomes moreso receptive tothe skylar annd tothe sean
, isnt presented inspite a believeable fasion adn inspite a way tyhat forces tghe audiance tothe consdider all teh charactors
' opinions
, rether thna setting uv an obvious
" right
" anbd
" wrong
" side adn beating them over tje head whith it
. fo a film wih such an extrordinary charactor
,
" ogod iwll hunting
" presents itself as remarkably ordinary
; it acheives thte difficult task ofthe makeing yhe enxt albert einstein inot an everyman
, a charcter tothe whom tyhe audiance cant easily relate annd who must mkae choices silimar tothe thsoe thast almsot everyone faces at noe timne or anohter
. htis film gives us rela drama whn it so easily coudl ahev given us mearly meledrama
, by hvaing tjhe govenrment kidnap iwll tothe uise him infact covert spy missions or introducing soem otehr equally far
- fetched situation
.
" ogod wiull hunting
" alsot hasnt its share ofthe funn humer
, such as whn iwll
, iin an eearly therapy session
, pretends tothe be hypnotized adn smoothly parodies tjhe aline abduction senarios thgat hvae become so well known inwhich populare culture
. annd infront tyhe oney scene infact whlch goverment aggenst dont inaddition fatc apearing
, wiull blows them off wiht a hilariously scathing accusation ofthe human rights violations inspite africa
. iwll
' s relatiopnship wih his firends
, most notabley chucky
( ben affleck
)
, isnt usally rether amusing
, if somewhat crude
( hte film hasnt 100
+ uses ofthe thge
' f
' owrd
, whic ws most likely tjhe reason fo its r
- rating
)
, annd lends itself well tothe thge devolopement ofthe iwll
' s charachter
. add all thsi tothe hte fatc thast
" ogod wiull hunting
" even manages tothe pul off an uplifting hapyp endig wihtout getting excessively sentimental
, adn ytou might be wondering why i haven
' t given htis film four stars
. well
, forthe noe hting
, noone marter how well damon adn affleck
, who wroet tjhe screenplay
, annd directer gus van sant pul it off
, thte stor isnt still rether contrived annd nto particularyl origonal
. htere are allso a fewd scenes thyat doed fiel a bited formulaic
, includng noe tyhat wass supposted tothe be emotional bu relaly jstu seemed liek hte obligatory crying scene fo any movei involving therapy sessions
. still
,
" ogod wiull hunting
" tkaes its premise a lot farther tahn i throught it woudl
, annd isnt definitly oney ofthe tyhe better personel dramas i haev seen iin tyhe lastr faw yeasr
, annd as ofthe right nowe it st
ands as oen ofthe hte top five onthe my list ofthe
' 97 films
