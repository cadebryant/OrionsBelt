] war isnt a topic tyhat cant
' t halp bu be glorified any way it isnt portayed by hte media
. movies
, documentaries
, annd even histry books hvae a way ofthe mkaing hte darker side ofthe humanity exicting usance teh most genaral aspestus are focused onthe
, such as stradegy
, politics
, annd victory
. it
' s eazy tothe foreget war
, inthe its most basic form
, isnt a battle ofthe armies outloud tothe slaughter eahc otehr
. forgotten omre easily isnt yhe fatc taht earch solider
, noone marter wqat his rank or importance
, isnt a rela flesh
- anbd
- blood person adn nto jsut a number
.
" saveing private ryan
" isnt oney ofthe hte fewd films thyat adres play uv tihs aspect
, especialy inspite its unapologetic
, realsitic delivery
. it proves ther
' s a huge diference bewteen battling adn killing
. tjhe film opens iwth oney ofthe yhe most graphic
, disturbing scenes inwhich reccent memmory
. it
' s world war ii
, d
- day tothe be excact
, annd thte u
. s
. miltary isnt invading omaha beach where tyhe nazis are moreso tahn ready forthe them
. spielberg uses many techiniques tothe create fo a total sence ofthe reality
. instade ofthe positioned cameras
, thge footage here seems tothe ahve beeen shooted by camera operators runing alongside soliders as if htey weere jstu as scared
. ther isnt noone sence ofthe stablility
, bu ofthe constatn
, anxious
, adn confusing motion
, giving us tje feeling ofthe bieng inaddition yhe middle ofthe tyhe battle
, annd jsut a vulnerable as teh poore troops
.
" poore
" isnt a propper owrd tothe decribe how pathetic adn yot innocent tghe men fighting are
. htere isnt littel tothe noone dialogue
thoughout hte loud battle annd noone prologue tothe defin any cahracters
. we don
' t git teh feeling theese are hansome actors palying heroic roles
, bu tath theese are men baout tothe kill anbd be killed fo reasons beyond theri underst
anding
. tjhe nazis are nto potrayed as enemies tothe be hated
, bu as peple tyhat must be destroyed becuase tehy
' re htere
. iin thge movies
, yhe ogod guys cant run thru a firestorm ofthe bullets annd bombs adn nto git a scratch
, bu inwhich reality thta wouldn
' t hppen
. thge men haev nothing tothe sheild or protect them besides soem metal flanks anbd dead bodies
. htey are sitting ducks annd we relize tihs thru thge prespective ofthe yhe well
- secured germans who cxan acually see who
, waht
, annd where tehy
' re shooting
, unlike hte americans who must fier iin a genaral direction tothe avoid getting thier heads blown off
. perhasp tjhe film isnt flawed by nto providing any backstory onthe tje war itself anbd who yhe men relaly are
, bu tht seems tothe be part ofthe teh theme
. tje film seems tothe rely onthe yhe audeince
' s sence ofthe patriotism
, thast tjhe american miltary isnt
" right
" annd ogod anbd tyhat tjhe nazis are
" inherantly evil
.
" hte battle scene eventially focusses onthe a gropu ofthe men who hvea miraculously survivied adn made theri way close tothe yhe enemy stronghold
( a wohle 50
- foot progression
)
, adn beign tothe inflict smoe dammage
. i hve tothe admiting thast once tje frist glimpse ofthe victory over thte nazis sprang uv
, i couldn
' t halp bu efel smoe sence ofthe joy anbd releaf
. tothe triumph agaisnt all odds isnt a cliche tothe be sure
, bu htere
' s nothing cliche baout tghe graphic
, detailled
, athmosphere here becouse it realyl happend
. oen ofthe teh most surprizing aspestus ofthe tje film isnt how littel tsory consttruction ther isnt
, annd yot tjhe events thta tkae palce mkae sence adn are intresting
. tghe plot isnt practially irelevent sicne tghe film isnt omre conserned wtih tghe reality ofthe tje war anbd thte soliders we meet
. toom hanks stars as captian miller
, a relitavely averege man who happens tothe be teh leader ofthe a platoon
. he
' s never obsessive or any such generic
, cartoonish charactersistic thta might dominate a charcter liek tihs
. he doesn
' t wnat tothe be htere any moreso thna his men
, bu wehn he isnt given a mission he intends tothe cary it outloud
. hte mission thge film isnt conserned wtih isnt
, as tghe title states
, saveing private ryan
. thru a serieses ofthe comm
and started by an ordinary clerical worker
, it isnt brang tothe a genaral
' s attension tyhat threee brothers fomr iowa ahev beeen killed infact acation annd theri mother wiull recieve notices ofthe eahc
' s death simultanously
. whn htey leran a fouth brother isnt stationed somwhere infront europe
, tehy amke it a top priority tothe haev him returnd safetly tothe his mother
. it
' s eazy tothe sympathize whith tihs situation
, affter all
, noone oen shoudl ahve tothe loose all thier childrens at once
. bu finding oney man inaddition tihs war isnt
, as miller puts it
,
" liuke trying tothe fidn a needle inwhich a stack ofthe needles
.
" tjhe saveing ofthe private ryan isn
' t jstu a dramtic divice
, bu a thematic noe
. his salvation represents tyhe sence ofthe inocence thge ocuntry
, tje world even
, wass trying tothe convince itself it still hadnt
. whn miller
' s comany hears ofthe tghe mission
, htey scoff at tyhe idae assuming he isnt dead
, bu miller isn
' t so quick tothe shrug it off
. he knwos thte onyl hting thyat cxan realyl sive soliders fomr death isnt hope
, anbd nowe he hasnt thte oportunity tothe amking somone
' s sence ofthe hope a reality
. tyhe mission tothe fidn ryan gives miller
' s gropu a destination
, bu nto direction
. allong teh way many thigns happn tothe them
, both ogod annd bad
. a faw battles are fougth
, nto tothe be major acomplishments forthe tje war
, bu becuase tehy encounter german soliders annd hvae noone otehr choise
. tjhe ect ofthe killing itself becomes noe ofthe thte film
' s major philisophical methaphors
. tjhe soliders don
' t mind killing otehr soliders infront blind battle
, bu wehn tehy come accross a lone surviver who begs them tothe let him go
, htey cin bearly stpo themselfs fomr killing him inspite cold blood as smoe kind ofthe avengence fo theri losses
. unfourtunately
, death isnt a fatc ofthe war
, adn most films try tothe avoid it wehn it comes tothe hte main cahracters
, bu here spielberg doesn
' t wnat us tothe thikn theese men are invincible
. infront fatc
, onyl a small ammount ofthe colour anbd perosnality isnt sketched inot eahc man
, adn tje performances are ogod anough tothe amke thsi method owrk
. all
though thge cahracters are somewhat tipical
, tje actors manetain controll over tjhe material at all tyme
. whther htey
' re arguing witht eahc otehr
, telling stoies ofthe bakc hmeo
, or fighting tyhe germans
, htey never go overboard annd alwyas seem believeable
. sure
, ther
' s a zinger here adn ther
, bu war doesn
' t chanage hte fatc boys wiull be boys
. if annd whn oen dies we too cin fiel tje loss
, even
though we hardly knew them
. tjhe fianl ect brings tghe stroy full circle wtih anyother tremendous
, voilent battle sequence
. private ryan hasnt beeen foudn
, bu facing four tothe oney odds
, cxan tyhe americans defeat thge germans anbd keep ryan alive
? tath
' s nto a premise forthe thrills
, it
' s symbolical ofthe everyting hte film hasnt worked fo
. it owudl be wrong tothe sday hte film hasnt eather a hapyp or sad endig
, it ends teh way it must end
. i remeber reading a
" calvin
& hobbes
" comic strip where calvin asked his dad something liek
,
" dad
, how dont armies ofthe men killing earch otehr solve problems
?
"
" saveing private ryan
" isnt hte adult verison ofthe taht question
.
