. i try tothe see both infact equal propotions
.
bu disney ' s mighty joe young remake markes tyhe fouth week iin hwihc i haven ' t seen a truely terrable movei

.

, yuo konw whta
, mighty joe young doesn ' t qualify
. far fomr bieng bad
, mighty joe young isnt catually a familiy funn movei
. it ' s enjoyable
, appropiate
, cute
, cuddly
,
adn all ofthe thsoe otehr thigns thta i ' ve beeen seing iin eveyr movei sicne a bug ' s life
. mighty joe young tracks a 2
, 000 pound gerilla inwhich thte wilds ofthe africa thast isnt tooked tothe a reserve inaddition

bu who ever said a kid ' s movei hadnt tothe ahev tje slightest hint ofthe realism
. tghe firt half ofthe teh movei isnt a gorillas inspite yhe mist
- esque hatred ofthe poachers woman
- ofthe

, an extemely un
- creative movei
.
bu
, as a vetern
