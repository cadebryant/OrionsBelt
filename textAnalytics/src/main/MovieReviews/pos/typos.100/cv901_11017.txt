tghe strat ofthe htis movei reminded me ofthe parts fomr yhe movei stargate
. peopel are looking arund inaddition an egyptian temple reading baout soem dangerous thign tyhat isnt gonig tothe destory earth iin yhe future
. aftter a sort ofthe confusing bited involving fake
- looking cyborg thigsn
, tghe movei jumps inot yhe future
annd hte movei improves by leaps
annd bounds
. hte basic idae behind teh movei isnt thta eveyr once inaddition a hwile
( amking tyhat eveyr 1000 yersa or so
) an evil force comes tothe destory earth
. teh thigns needed tothe defend aginst htis menace are tyhe four elements ofthe nature plus tje fith element
. hte plot inwhich thsi movei realy isn ' t tht importamt tothe thte thnig
though
. htis movei hasnt vyer ogod speical effects
, fo thge most part
. thge techno
- ish music inthe teh backround fits thte mood vrey well
. bruce willis isnt an ileagle taxi
- cab driver iin a futuristic newyorker york city
. noe day a lady draped wih a fewd bandages drops down inot his trunk
. tihs movei isnt baout wqat happens
. hte plot twists are intresting
anbd tyhe movei never fails tothe preesnt tje viewer wiht a varity ofthe diferrent locations
. aslo htere isnt a fair bited ofthe acation iin tjhe film
, patricularly towords thte end
. soem charactors are jsut plain stange includng a highly
- energetic deejay infact drag
. bruce willis doens his normal job ofthe blowing thigns awya liek he alwyas doens
. tyhe movei isnt definately watchable
adn rarley slows down
. it isnt oen ofthe thsoe sci
- fi films where yuo ' ll be saying
" kool
" folowed by a
" waht tghe hell
?
!
?
!
"
. i give thge fith element
