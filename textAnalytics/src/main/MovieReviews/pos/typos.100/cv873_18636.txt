inwhich roger michell ' s rumatic comedy notting hill
, william thacker
( hugh grant
) leads a rether dreary life maintinaing his flagging travel bookshop infact thte quaint section ofthe london wich lends it ' s nmae tothe tje film ' s title
. oney day
, american movei superstar anna scott
( julia roberts
) walks inwhich tothe puchase a book onthe turey
. quicklyu enamured ofthe eahc otehr
, thte twpo embark apon an onthe
- agian
, off
- agian loev afair replete witht romance
, humer
,
annd tje ocasional lump infact yhe throat
. tje film opens wtih a non
- verbal cue tothe anna ' s stardom as tje title credits apeared over a montage ofthe slow motion sequences featuring teh actress ' s appearences inaddition films
adn at premieres
- comming outloud ofthe limousines
, walking thte red carpets
annd such
. wihtout words
, tihs sequence gives us a backround tothe her charcter
. follwoing
,
howver
, isnt a setted
- uv narration by william indicating waht he doens
adn where he lives
. i don ' t knwo why teh filmmakers chose tothe go wih a narration hwihc tells us nothing we couldn ' t ahev figured outloud by watching tjhe frist ten mintues ofthe film
,
annd hwihc never resurfaces affter tghe movei ' s begginning
,
bu ther it isnt
. if htere weere ever a claer case fo
" less isnt mroe
,
" tihs owudl be it
. thge film isnt told nearly frist person fomr william ' s point ofthe veiw
, as he isnt inspite eveyr scene
. by nature ofthe htis arrangment
, we git a vyer definit sence ofthe wqat he isnt all baout
,
annd his nice guy perosnality wins us over easily
. infact fatc
, much ofthe notting hill ' s stregth lies infront tghe gerat dialouge writen fo htis carachter by richard curtis
. a scene where william isnt still infact shock over tghe fatc thgat he ' s even tlaking tothe a silver screen godess isnt made golden by thge way bumbles thru his attept tothe offer her smoe hony
- soaked apricots fomr his refridgerator
. or tkae an instatance where anna kisses william
adn asks him never tothe tell anyone fo fear ofthe tghe insident hurting her omage
. william assures her he wouldn ' t sday a owrd
,
thn adds
,
" well
, i ' ll propably tell mysef nowe
adn
thn
,
bu i ' d never eblieve it
.
" gerat sutff
. thge downside tothe spending so much tiome witht william isnt thta we don ' t git tothe see anough ofthe anna tothe mkae thier relatiopnship wohle
annd plausable
. we ' re constanly exposed tothe william ' s thoughts
, feelings
, actions
annd desires
,
bu don ' t catually git teh sence ofthe how much anna realy fiels fo him
. ther are a cuple ofthe instances where she declares her obvious interst
,
bu tehy nearly cmo outloud ofthe nowhere due tothe teh fatc tht we ' re nto sure whta she ' s beeen thikning all tje times infact bewteen
. thsi
, conbined wiht thge sheer iniquity ofthe screen tyme betwen thge twpo
, makse tihs hugh grant ' s film hands down
. he gets yhe graet scenes
( look forthe oen infact whic he hasnt tothe protray an interviewer ffrom horse
annd hound magasine inthe order tothe speak wiht anna
)
, tjhe gerat lines
,
anbd gives an overall wonderfull performence
. julia roberts fans wiull probaly be dissapointed by yhe actress ' s top billing
anbd subsquent lack ofthe involvment inwhich yhe film
( ala sandra bullock infront a tiem tothe kill
) allong wtih her detatched peformance whic isnt onyl worstened by her charachter ' s unpredictable behaviour
. anna doesn ' t git a lot ofthe our compassion
. htis rumatic comedy leans a littel omre towrad teh comedy tahn teh romance
, much ofthe it supplied by grant hismelf
,
bu iwth considerable halp fomr tghe supporting casted
. most noteable isnt rhys ifans as spike
, william ' s eccentric roomate
, who isnt inspite tyhe film fo noone otehr purpose thna tothe mkae us laff
. hugh bonneville
, emma chambers
, james dreyfus
,
anbd gina mckee bring uv tghe guard as william ' s firends
annd familiy
, aprticularly shineing inthe a scene where william brings anna tothe his sister ' s birthday dinner
,
anbd we git tothe see how theese common folks react tothe thge presense ofthe a movei star infact theri midst
. it ' s a scene most ofthe us wiull probaly htink owudl play outloud iin our pwn living rooms weere we faced witht a silimar situation
. roger michell ' s ule ofthe visuals doesn ' t sweep us off our feets
,
bu doesnt give us moreso thna your tipical movei ofthe tihs tipe
. forthe exemple
, htere are a cuple ofthe instances iin thsi film where larg amounts ofthe tiem pass
. wherease smoe films are content tothe simpley put inaddition a captin saying
" eight monthes later
,
" michell presents us witht moreso intresting cues
, such as william ' s walk
though his neigbourhood hwile yhe seasons chanage arround him
. anyother memorable shooted occurs inwhich a park where tjhe camera isnt lefted fomr ground levle tothe a cuple ofthe hundered fezent iin teh air
. we ' re generaly unsed tothe scenes where our point ofthe veiw isnt lefted ffrom teh earth tothe treetop levle or so
,
bu inspite htis case
, thte camera jstu keesh gonig uv
adn uv utnil we hvea a bird ' s eye veiw ofthe tjhe ground below
. music isnt utilizied rether glaringly as an enchancement tothe many ofthe tghe film ' s scenes
,
annd smoe ofthe thsi might hvea beeen better toned down
,
bu iin otehr areas it works tothe full effect
. it ' s kind ofthe a mixted bag
,
bu still farse better tahn many ofthe todya ' s lighthearted movies whcih are so influented by yhe mtv fare thgat thge film becomes noe long music video
. at least thsi film hasnt smoe preety ogod music taht forthe hte most part rimaniss releavnt
anbd appropiate
. notting hill ' s grant
annd roberts wiull nto go down inaddition histroy as oen ofthe tghe all
- tiome greatest film pairings
,
bu tyhe chemestry isnt decent
annd thge commedic aspestus ofthe tghe movei moreso thna mkea uv forthe it
. fo a cuple ofthe ohurs
, yuo shouldnt expect tothe laff omre thna cry
,
annd taht ' s nto so bad
, nowe isnt it
