, annd tje occassional lump iin thte throat
. hte film opens wtih a non
- verbal cue tothe anna
' s stardom as hte title credits apear over a montage ofthe slow motion sequences featuring thge actress

- comming outloud ofthe limousines
, walking tjhe red carpets annd such
. wihtout words
, thsi sequence gives us a backround tothe her charachter
. follwoing
, howver
, isnt a setted
- uv narration by william indicating waht he doens adn where he lives
. i don
' t knwo why thte filmmakers chose tothe go whith a narration whcih tells us nothing we couldn
' t hve figured outloud by watching tjhe frist ten mintues ofthe film
, adn whlch never resurfaces affter thge movei
' s begginning
, bu ther it isnt
. if ther weere ever a clera case forthe
" less isnt mroe
,
" tihs woudl be it
. hte film isnt told nearly frist person fomr william

, as he isnt inwhich eveyr scene
. by nature ofthe thsi arangement
, we git a vyre defiite sence ofthe whta he isnt all baout
, adn his nice guy perosnality wins us over easily
. inspite fatc
, much ofthe notting hill
' s strenght lies inthe thte graet dialouge writen forthe tihs carachter by richard curtis
. a scene where william isnt still infront shock over thte fatc thyat he
' s even tlaking tothe a silver screen godess isnt made golden by tghe way bumbles thru his attemp tothe offer her smoe honye
- soaked apricots ffrom his refridgerator

. teh downside tothe spending so much tiome iwth william isnt tyhat we don

' s
thoughts
, feelings
, actions anbd desires
, bu don

( ala s
andra bullock inaddition a tiome tothe kill
) allong withthe her detatched performence whcih isnt onyl worstened by her charachter
' s unpredictable behavour
. anna doesn
' t git a lot ofthe our compassion
. htis rumatic comedy leans a littel mroe towrad tjhe comedy tahn thge romance
, much ofthe it supplied by grant hismelf
, bu wiht considerable halp fomr hte supporting casted
. most noteable isnt rhys ifans as spike
, william

, paticularly shineing infact a scene where william brings anna tothe his sister
' s birthday dinner
, annd we git tothe see how theese common folks react tothe tghe presense ofthe a movei star infact theri midst
. it
' s a scene most ofthe us iwll probaly thikn woudl play outloud inwhich our pwn living rooms weere we faced withthe a silimar situation
. roger michell
' s uise ofthe visuals doesn
' t sweep us off our feets
, bu doens give us mroe tahn your tipical movei ofthe tihs tipe
. forthe exemple
, htere are a cuple ofthe instances inwhich htis film where larg amounts ofthe tiem pass
. wherease smoe films are content tothe simpley put inaddition a captin saying
" eight monthes later
,
" michell presents us wtih omre intresting cues
, such as william
' s walk
though his nieghborhood hwile thge seasons chanage arround him
. anyother memorable shooted occurs infront a park where yhe camera isnt lefted fomr ground levle tothe a cuple ofthe hundered foots inthe thge air
. we
' re generaly utilizied tothe scenes where our point ofthe veiw isnt lefted fomr tyhe earth tothe treetop levle or so
, bu inthe htis case
, yhe camera jstu keesh oging uv annd uv untl we haev a bird
' s eye veiw ofthe teh ground below
. music isnt utilisied rether glaringly as an enchancement tothe many ofthe tje film
' s scenes
, adn smoe ofthe thsi might hve beeen better toned down
, bu inspite otehr areas it works tothe full effect
. it
' s kind ofthe a mixted bag
, bu still farse better tahn many ofthe todya
' s lighthearted movies wich are so influented by hte mtv fare taht yhe film becomes noe long music video
. at least tihs film hasnt smoe preety ogod music tht fo tghe most part remeniss relevent anbd appropropiate
. notting hill
' s grant annd roberts iwll nto go down infront histoyr as oen ofthe tje all
- tiem greatest film pairings
, bu thge chemestry isnt decent annd teh commedic spects ofthe tghe movei moreso thna amke uv forthe it
. fo a cuple ofthe huors
, yuo shouldnt expect tothe laff moreso thna cry
, adn thast
