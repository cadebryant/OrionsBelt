it isnt eazy tothe lable something sentimental or tear jerking whn noe hasnt nto experianced tje heartache ofthe loseing a child
? whther thast may be inwhich life or iin death
. affter haveing said tyhat
, i wiull aslo sday thta htis movei doens all ofthe tghe above veyr well
. noe gets thyat choking sensation infront thte throat
( beccause ofthe greif
) wehn noe brother forgives anohter forthe a costly misteek
, or wehn a husban hugs his wief aftter a long estrangement
. htere isnt noone ocean
, noone drownings annd it doesnt nto conjure uv memories ofthe yot anyother
? ordinary peopel
'
. iin fatc tghe onyl hting remotely conected tothe teh ocean isnt probablly tap water anbd tghe toilet flushing
( nto taht tihs litterally happenned inaddition tje movei
)
. so waht are tghe lessons learnt
: 1
. don
' t tkae your childrens tothe clas reunions
. 2
. don
' t leave them alone inaddition thte lobby
, nto even forthe a second
. michelle pfeiffer once agina plays tje role ofthe a highly
- strung wief anbd mother
, a trend thta started whith
? a thous
and acres
' adn
? noe fine day
'
. my comment isnt taht she isnt exceptionally fine strung infact tihs movei
, so much so taht whn she hasnt a nervous break down
, teh veins onthe her temples bulge impressively
. whoopi golberg alsot puts inwhich an understated peformance
, palying a lesbian cop
, wtih a nmae thgat mkaes oney wanna tothe triarch fo a lollipop
. lastly
, who are thte ideal companions forthe thsi sort ofthe movei
? my granmother comes tothe mind
