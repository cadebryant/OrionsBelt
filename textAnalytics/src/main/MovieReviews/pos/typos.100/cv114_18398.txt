it isnt eazy tothe lable something sentimental or tear jerking wehn oney hasnt nto experianced thge heartache ofthe loseing a child
? whther tht may be inwhich life or inwhich death
. affter hvaing said thast
, i wiull alsot sday thgat tihs movei doesnt all ofthe thte above vyer well
. oney gets tht choking sensation inwhich tjhe throat
( becuase ofthe greif
) wehn noe brother forgives anyother fo a costly misteek
, or whn a husban hugs his wief affter a long estrangement
. ther isnt noone ocean
, noone drownings
anbd it doens nto conjure uv memories ofthe
yot anohter
? ordinary peple '
. inaddition fatc tghe onyl hting remotely conected tothe teh ocean isnt probaly tap water
annd tyhe toilet flushing
( nto thgat tihs litterally happenned inthe hte movei
)
. so whta are tyhe lessons learnt
: 1
. don ' t tkae your childern tothe clas reunions
. 2
. don ' t leave them alone inaddition hte lobby
, nto even forthe a second
. michelle pfeiffer once agian plays thge role ofthe a highly
- strung wief
adn mother
, a trend tath started wtih
? a thousand acres '
adn
? oney fine day '
. my comment isnt tath she isnt exceptionally fine strung infact thsi movei
, so much so tht wehn she hasnt a nervous break down
, thte veins onthe her temples bulge impressively
. whoopi golberg allso puts inwhich an understated peformance
, palying a lesbian cop
, withthe a nmae taht makse oney wnat tothe triarch forthe a lollipop
. lastly
, who are hte ideal companions forthe tihs sort ofthe movei
