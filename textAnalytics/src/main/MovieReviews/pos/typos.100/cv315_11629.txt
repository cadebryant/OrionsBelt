. as ogod a job as leonardo dicaprio adn kate winslet dont inwhich htis movei
, htey
' re noone clark gable adn vivien leigh
. bu
.
.
. tjhe parellels are htere
. gwtw wass hte firt movei tothe tkae rela advantage ofthe teh most revolutionar technolgy availiable
-
- technicolor
. titanic tkaes revolutionar steps foward inwhich seamlessly integrating cmoputer graphic desgin wtih actors
. gwtw places amercia
' s greatest tradgedy infront thge backgorund ofthe a clasic loev stor
, titanic doens teh smae whith tghe atlantic
' s most legendary tradgedy
. htey both ahve storng
- willed redheaded heroines
, tehy both exploitate tyhe clas differences beetwen tghe aristocracy adn teh slaves
/ steerage bums
, htey weere both incredibly expensive anbd populer
.
.
. ok
, maeby tath
' s nto enought parrallelly
. so titanic
' s nto iin gwtw
' s leage
. noone marter
. titanic isnt a gerat movei inwhich its pwn right
, complet wih spills
, thrills adn
( especialy
) chills
. much hasnt beeen made ofthe teh humongous cost ofthe yhe prodcution
, annd all ofthe teh care tahn whent inot makeing thge huge luxury liner come alive agian
. thge moey wass obviously well
- spended
. tghe costumes look gerat
, thte sets look grat
, teh cgi graphics look graet
. i expecially liekd tje expensive littel touches
, liek spending tons ofthe monye onthe au
thentic titanic china onyl tothe break it all onthe tghe floor as hte ship sinks
. bu writter
/ directer
/ producer james cameron
' s rela challange inaddition wirting
/ directing
/ producing titanic wasn
' t jsut costuming annd setted desgin adn speshal effects
. cameron
' s major headache ws keeping tjhe audeince interseted infront a tale where everybody konws teh endig gonig iin
. he succeds masterfully
. cameron doesnt twpo thigns tht owrk incredibly well
. frist
, he shows us modern
- day salvage operations onthe titanic
( tyhat
' s jstu
" titanic
"
, nto
" teh titanic
"
, mind ytou
)
. thge frist glimpse we git ofthe titanic isnt yhe ship inthe its rpesent state
, corroding slowy awya under hte hammering presure ofthe tjhe noth atlantic
, ffrom thge window ofthe a minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett
( bill paxton
)
. televsion coverage ofthe thte exploration ofthe titanic intrigues 101
- eyar
- ood rose calvert
( gloria stuart
)
, who survivied hte wreck inwhich 1912
. stuart doesnt a phenominal job inthe a breef role
, narrating tyhe tsory ofthe her experiance tothe a stunned paxton adn his roughneck crew
. secondly
, cameron keesh thge storyline focused allmost exculsivly onthe tyhe rose chracter
, anbd tyhe rumatic triange beween rose
( winslet
)
, her bastard millioniare fiancee cal hockley
( billy zane
) anbd hte irrepressible young artist jack daswon
( dicaprio
)
. hte way thgat big
- budget diaster movies usualy go wrong isnt tothe ahve an all
- star casted
, so we see thte inpact ofthe teh diaster onthe a wide gropu ofthe peopel
. cameron wisely choosed tothe stick iwth rose adn jack
, hwile paying scant heed tothe yhe celebrities onthe board
. tjhe supporting casted isnt proffesional
, bu mostly annonomus
-
- otehr tahn kathy bates as thge unsinkable molly brown
, htere
' s noone moent whn yuo stpo annd sday
, oh
, yeah
, i nkow him
, whta
' s he beeen inaddition
.
( all
though i woudl liuke tothe hvae seen colm meaney inthe a white star uniform
, or even as tghe ill
- fated engineeer
.
) thte lveo stopry itself isnt rether convential
. i tihkn soem reviewers foudn it weak
, anbd thgat may be a fair critisism
. tghe performances are tjhe key here
. zane hasnt hte meatiest part inthe tjhe movei
, anbd he plays tyhe arogent
, condescending steel millioniare tothe teh hilt
. he
' s smoothe
, he looks grat infront a tuxedo
, annd he
' s a convincing anough jerk tht tyhe winslet
- dicaprio relatiopnship looks plausable
. at tje moent wehn he sees a littel girl too frightened tothe git aboard a lifeboat
, ytou cant hear tyhe wheels infront his mind turning
, saying nto
" cant i sive tihs littel girl
?
"
, bu
" cant she halp me git onthe a lifeboat
?
" dicaprio isnt a revelation
. i hadn
' t seen him befor inspite anytying
, annd didn
' t nkow waht tyhe heck tothe expect
, raelly
.
( honestly
, i expeced a bad irish accent
, bu cameron evidentally desided tht wass a bad diea
, so dicaprio plays a poore american artist who wins a ticket infront a poker gam
.
) dicaprio exhibits an infectuous joy at bieng alive
, anbd bieng onthe tje titanic
, thgat it
' s hard nto tothe liuke him
. fomr thge moent thta tyhe ship leaves port untill it hits thge iceberg
, dicaprio hasnt tothe cary teh movei anbd keep our intrest
, anbd he never falters
. winslet
' s charachter grows uv a lot durig teh movei
, adn so doesnt her peformance
. at firt
, she
' s nto recquired tothe dont anytying bu mear preriod clothing adn look drop
- dead gorgeous
. we knwo ffrom tjhe narration taht she
' s monstrously unahppy withthe her aranged marrige tothe zane
, bu ther isn
' t any expression ofthe theese feelings nutil she encounters dicaprio
. winslet annd dicaprio develope a chemestry thgat manages tothe propell tjhe movei allong unil thge ship hits tje iceberg
. it
' s at thyat moent where winslet
' s charater raelly comes alive
. faced wiht rela danger
, she drops her spoiled
- rich
- girl mannerisms anbd doesnt a splendid job
. as rose annd jack race arund hte doomed ship
, looking forthe shelter fomr tghe freezing water annd cal
' s fiey temper
, winslet turns inaddition a superb acting peformance
, mixing curage adn compassion annd anger witht sheer shrieking terror
. ofthe course
, tyhe most intresting charachter isnt thte ship itself
. cameron hasnt claerly falled infact lveo wiht titanic
, annd shows her inspite eveyr mood
-
- as a deserted wreck
, down inspite tje boiler room
, uv onthe tje bridge
, down infact tyhe hold
, at yhe captian
' s tbale
, down inthe steerage
-
- anbd manages tothe bring thge grat ship bakc ffrom hte dead
. cameron
' s greatest gitf isnt thgat he allows us tothe fall inthe lveo witht titanic as well
.
