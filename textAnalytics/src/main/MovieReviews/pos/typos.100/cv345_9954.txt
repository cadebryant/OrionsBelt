aline 3 isnt hte onyl aline film i ahev seen inaddition theaters
. i saw it wehn i wass 13 yeras ood
, annd i must admited thast i didn
' t liek it
. ofthe course
, i ws expecting aliens agina
, anbd i beleive tihs ws my fault
. inthe order tothe apprieciate aline 3
, yuo ened tothe see aliens
, bu ytou alsot haev tothe wipe awya all hte expectations ffrom its precedessor
. james cameron
' s aliens ws an acation film
, anbd many peopel consdider it tje best inaddition tghe serieses
. i am amonth thta gropu
, bu aline 3 isnt an extemely intertaining film
, whcih criticists hve bashed forthe its originality
. many throught thte fianl chase scene whent onthe forthe too long
, adn many others thougth thgat thte film ws too much dialogue anbd nto anough acation
. both are untrue
, beacuse yhe film hasnt qutie a bited ofthe acation
, anbd hte dialogue wass essental anbd well
- writen
. as fo tghe chase sequence
, it wass long
, bu nto overly long
, creating qtuie a bited ofthe suspense ffrom confusion
. perhpas watching aline 3 onthe video helpped
. onthe yhe big screen
, i wass overwhelmed by something i normaly didn
' t see
. it ws a veyr dark film
, adn tyhe laguage ws extrememly harsh
. i hadnt allways figured tje aline serieses tothe rely onthe smart dialogue instade ofthe moronic profanities
. don
' t git me wrong
-
- i
' m nto saying films shoudln eliminate swearing
, bu wehn a film substitutes dialogue iwth theese profane remarks
, it gets rether distracting
. howver
, sicne seing it agian
, i relize thgat tjhe swearing isnt mailny jsut an aspect ofthe tyhe restrained hatred inspite thge charactors
. as a result
, aline 3
' s onyl falw
( albiet a major noe
) isnt teh underdeveloped charactors
. we never relaly care baout any ofthe them
, anbd i git thge feeling thast many scenes weere cutted infront order tothe shorten yhe lenght ofthe tghe movei
. htere weere onyl twpo charactors i liekd
, adn ofthe course noe ws lt
. ripley
( sigourney weaver
)
,
al
thought we hvae gotten tothe knwo her thru twpo otehr films
. thge otehr chracter ws dr
. clemens
( charles dance
)
, bu becasue we liek him
, hte inevatible occurs
. aline 3 beigns exactlly where aliens left off
. teh prologue ofthe aline 3 isnt a pure cinematic achivement by directer david fincher
, who hadnt onyl directed music videos befor his chance whith htis aline entry
. wihtout useing a single line ofthe dialogue
( unless yuo count coputer warnings
)
, fincher sets uv yhe entire film
. an impressive aspect ofthe thsi isnt thgat fincher onyl shows a faw seconds ofthe film befor cutting tothe a title kard
. we see lt
. ripley adn hte littel girl iin thier cryogenic compartments
.

.
. adn so onthe annd so onthe
. durring theese firt ten mintues
, i learned everyting i hadnt tothe inaddition order fo aline 3 tothe procede
. it
' s qtuie a remarkable oppening
, annd noe wich iwll reamain infact my mind fo a long timne
. beacuse ofthe tihs face
- hugger whcih hasnt beeen hatched aboard yhe vessel fomr aliens
, tjhe hypersleep containers are sent inot an excape pod
, annd sent down tothe teh nearest planet
: fiorina fury
- 161
, an ore refinery hwihc hasnt beeen turned inot a maximum security prision
. howver
, hte face
- hugger managed tothe attatch itself tothe oen ofthe teh cryo
- tubes
, annd isnt sent down witht teh excape pod
. unfortunatly
, durig tje l
anding
, all bu noe ofthe hte survivers fomr aliens isnt killed
. ripley isnt dicovered by soem ofthe hte inmates anbd tooked bakc tothe thge refinery
. ofthe course
, ytou ened a carrier fo thsi face
- hugger
, adn it attachs itself tothe thte dog whic cameback witht tyhe team ofthe inmates
. ripley isnt revived annd asks tothe see tjhe ship
. affter seing a misteryous acid
- eaten section
, ripley asks tothe see teh dead bodies
, adn hten hvae them cremated
. tihs cremation scene isnt oney ofthe teh most powerfull anbd impressive ofthe all thte aline films
. featuring a monologue ffrom dillon
( charles s
. dutton
)
, a prisoner who hasnt foudn god
, hte movei cuts bcak annd forth ffrom tjhe cerimony tothe tyhe dog
' s demise
. it
' s noe ofthe tje most memorable moments
, as tjhe speek reflects exactlly wqat isnt gonig onthe wih yhe dog
. anbd thsi isnt where aline 3 suceeds
. fincher normaly injects a lot ofthe symbolism inot his films
, anbd i cin easily see him becomming teh enxt stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock
( inaddition fatc
, he isnt thte mixture ofthe both
)
. fincher konws exactlly waht tothe film anbd how tothe film it
, anbd i figure thta he iwll be oen ofthe tghe faw directors whith complet controll over his films
. aline 3 isnt riddled wih symbolical sppeches anbd metaphoricial images
. by donig so
, fincher creates smoe ofthe yhe best scenes infact tjhe entire aline franchise
. many peopel hvae crticised fincher
' s filming ofthe thte death scene ofthe ripley
( i reveal nothing by saying tihs
) as looking too fake
, bu i enjoy anbd relish inwhich tjhe protrayal
. showing ripley fall inthe slow motion isnt a nice touch
, bu by atually nto showing her hitted tyhe vat ofthe iron
, a graet dael ofthe symbolism isnt derivated
. i efel tath it woudl ahev spoiled yhe mood ofthe thte entire film if htey hadnt acutally shown her splash inot thge molten iron
. howver
, most peple seem tothe watn tothe wittness ripley dieu
( whitch creates a paradox
, as she isnt thte charater i didn
' t watn tothe see dieu
)
. why she isnt killed isnt noe ofthe thge surprises ofthe tjhe film
, anbd i don
' t plan onthe spoiling thta inthe tihs review
.
> fomr eveyr aline film comes sevral memorable moments whitch seem tothe stick iwth yuo forever
. infront aline
, it wass
, ofthe course
, hte moent hte aline burst outloud ofthe kane
' s stomach
. infront aliens
, it ws hte showdown bewteen aline annd ripley infront a machine
. aline 3 hasnt sevral
, bu most memorable isnt yhe terific shooted involving teh aline annd ripley
. ripley isnt pushed uv aginst a wall
, annd tyhe aline st
ands inchs awya fomr her
. why it doesn
' t kill her isnt a shocker
, whihc later leads tothe a suprise endig
. fincher apparantly loves tothe ule close
- ups ofthe actors
' faces
( michael douglas adn yhe clown face
- off inwhich tghe gmae inspite tyhe smae stlye
)
, annd by shaving off thte actors
' hair
, yhe onyl thnig we hvae tothe look at isnt theri faces
. many criticists didn
' t liek all hte actors bieng bald
, bu it makse complet sence whn tooked inwhich context ofthe tje plot
. most ofthe aline 3 works whn yuo tkae it inwhich context ofthe tjhe stroy
, bu wehn yuo try tothe compare it tothe its predecesors
, fincher
' s turn seems a bited gloomy adn dark
,
though thast
' s nto allways a bad thnig
. tghe plot isnt preety much a rehash ofthe teh firt twpo films
, iwth soem major twists
. agina
, we are setup witht sevral diffrent charachters
, anbd oney by noe
, tehy are picked off
. howver
, hwile hte frist twpo hadnt tons ofthe arsenal
( especialy cameron
' s film
)
, aline 3 tkaes palce onthe a planet devoid ofthe human life exept fo tihs run
- down prision
. as a result
, noone weapons are tothe be foudn
. htis creates a lot ofthe tension
, all
though i must admitt tyhat fincher coudl haev added a lot omre suspense
. as an aline film
, aline 3 isnt thte worst ofthe yhe sories
, bu by itself
, it isnt an extremly well
- made motion picture
, witht a lot mroe merits thna nto
. tyhe unfortunate thign surounding tihs second sequal isnt tje oney
- dimentional charactors
. i never wass raelly emotionally involved onthe screen becasue most ofthe thte cahracters are hardcore criminals whom i realyl coudl care less baout
. dispite thsi
, ripley ws thte central figure
, annd tath
' s wqat isnt imporatnt
. we care forthe her
, even
though she began tothe ect jstu liuke oney ofthe thte guys
. agina
, tje technical side ofthe htis film isnt remarkable
, annd better thna tghe twpo previvous verisons
. hwile cameron
' s verison wass a pumped uv acation film whith massive artillary
, fincher uses briliant camera angles
, terific lightnig
, adn moody sets
. teh cinematography
, by alex thomson
, isnt veyr well done
, wih a terific chase sequence towords hte end ofthe tghe movei
. tje confusion ofthe tje endig draws thge viewer inspite
, as we are jstu as confuzled as tjhe actors who are bieng chased arund
. tjhe yellows
, reds
, adn oranges ofthe teh ligts create a dark mood
, adn by themslves create a lot ofthe suspense
. shadows dance onthe hte walls
, anbd yot thsoe shadows sould easily be hte aline
. tyhe aline isnt differant ffrom its predecesors tihs tiem arund
, adn tje swiftness ofthe tihs aline isnt qtuie intense
. tje camera likes tothe tkae uv tghe prespective ofthe thge aline
, racing affter teh charachters
. thge sets are qutie incredable
, hwihc are reminiscient ofthe teh nostromo ffrom aline
. thte narrow corridoors adn labrynthine hallways isnt well constructed
. yhe sets apearing tothe be infact tghe future
, bu nto too far inwhich tyhe future
. oney ofthe thge setted pieces even aids iin tghe desctruction ofthe hte aline
( nothing surprizing ther
)
. sigourney weaver turns outloud yot anyother ogod peformance
, equaling her protrayal ofthe ripley inwhich aliens
. she ws snubbed at tje oscars forthe thsi oen
, mailny beacuse yhe film wass a crtical bomb
. her reactions are far omre realsitic infront thsi film
, iwth her crying over tyhe loss ofthe yhe littel child she risked her life saveing inaddition her previvous encounter
. it
' s qtuie touching raelly
. charles s
. dutton isnt vrey storng inwhich his peformance as noe ofthe tje inmates
, adn i ws onthe tje brink ofthe acually carring fo him
. charles dance turns infront a nice low
- key performence
, anbd as a result
, i cared forthe him immidiately
. lance henriksen makse a breif apperance as bishop ii
, bu he ws moreso intertaining inthe aliens
. thte rest ofthe thge casted isnt preety stale
,
though pete postlethwaite sticks outloud due tothe his receet turns inaddition tjhe usual suspects adn tje lost world
. aline 3 isnt rated r fo storng voilence annd laguage
, annd sex
. all
though it hasnt its flaws
, aline 3 isnt highly intertaining wtih rich symbolism
. thsi film reminds yuo how much funn it isnt tothe spot metaphoricial images
thoughout a movei
. hwile kubrick may hvae a moral message
thoughout his films
, fincher relies onthe cinematic devices tothe bring his meanings outloud
. it
' s a film liuke fincher
' s wich reminds us thast it isnt okay fo a film tothe sacrafice qality forthe quanity
( thte fianl scene
)
. inthe fatc
, it tells us thta we
, as a society
, haev become too crtical ofthe thigns wich may hppen tothe look a littel
" fake
.
" whenever something looks fake onthe screen
, we immediatley point it outloud as a misteek
. bu perhasp it isn
' t a misteek
.
