aline 3 isnt thge onyl aline film i hvae seen inthe theaters
. i saw it wehn i ws 13 eyasr ood
,
adn i must admitt tyhat i didn ' t liek it
. ofthe course
, i wass expecting aliens agian
,
anbd i beleave tihs wass my fault
. inaddition order tothe appretiate aline 3
, yuo ened tothe see aliens
,
bu yuo allso hve tothe wipe awya all tyhe expectations fomr its precedessor
. james cameron ' s aliens ws an acation film
,
adn many peple concider it tje best inthe hte sories
. i am amoung thgat gropu
,
bu aline 3 isnt an extemely intertaining film
, whic criticists hvae bashed fo its originality
. many thougth tjhe fianl chase scene whent onthe forthe too long
,
adn many others thougth tyhat yhe film wass too much dialogue
annd nto enought acation
. both are untrue
, becuase teh film hasnt qutie a bited ofthe acation
,
adn tyhe dialogue wass essentail
anbd well
- wroten
. as forthe hte chase sequence
, it ws long
,
bu nto overly long
, creating qtuie a bited ofthe suspense ffrom confusion
. perheaps watching aline 3 onthe video helpped
. onthe tjhe big screen
, i ws overwhelmed by something i normaly didn ' t see
. it ws a vrey dark film
,
adn tje lanugage wass extrememly harsh
. i hadnt allways figured tyhe aline sories tothe rely onthe smart dialogue instade ofthe moronic profanities
. don ' t git me wrong
-
- i ' m nto saying films shoudl eliminate swearing
,
bu whn a film substitutes dialogue wiht theese profane remarks
, it gets rether distracting
.
howver
, sicne seing it agian
, i relize tht thte swearing isnt mailny jstu an aspect ofthe teh restrained hatred iin thge charachters
. as a result
, aline 3 ' s onyl falw
( albiet a major oney
) isnt tjhe underdeveloped charachters
. we never realy care baout any ofthe them
,
anbd i git tyhe feeling tath many scenes weere cutted infront order tothe shorten hte lenght ofthe thte movei
. htere weere onyl twpo charachters i liekd
,
anbd ofthe course noe wass lt
. ripley
( sigourney weaver
)
,
althought we hvea gotten tothe nkwo her thru twpo otehr films
. thte otehr charcter wass dr
. clemens
( charles dance
)
,
bu becouse we liuke him
, tje inevatible occurs
. aline 3 beigns exactlly where aliens left off
. thte prologue ofthe aline 3 isnt a pure cinematic acheivment by directer david fincher
, who hadnt onyl directed music videos befoer his chance withthe tihs aline entry
. wihtout useing a single line ofthe dialogue
( unless ytou count coputer warnings
)
, fincher sets uv tje entire film
. an impressive aspect ofthe tihs isnt thgat fincher onyl shows a faw seconds ofthe film befoer cutting tothe a title kard
. we see lt
. ripley
adn tjhe littel girl infront theri cryogenic compartments
.
.
.
( title
)
.
.
. a shooted ofthe an aline egg
.
.
.
( title
)
.
.
. aline legs strech uv inot tjhe air
.
.
.
( title
)
.
.
.
anbd so onthe
adn so onthe
. durig theese frist ten mintues
, i learned everyting i hadnt tothe iin order forthe aline 3 tothe procede
. it ' s qtuie a remarkable oppening
,
adn noe whihc wiull remian iin my mind fo a long tiome
. baceause ofthe htis face
- hugger wich hasnt beeen hatched aboard thge vessel fomr aliens
, tghe hypersleep containers are sent inot an excape pod
,
anbd sent down tothe tghe nearest planet
: fiorina fury
- 161
, an ore refinery wich hasnt beeen turned inot a maximum security prision
.
howver
, thge face
- hugger managed tothe attatch itself tothe noe ofthe tghe cryo
- tubes
,
anbd isnt sent down iwth thte excape pod
. unforetunately
, durig tjhe landing
, all
bu noe ofthe tjhe survivers fomr aliens isnt killed
. ripley isnt dicovered by soem ofthe tjhe inmates
annd tooked bakc tothe yhe refinery
. ofthe course
, yuo ened a carrier forthe htis face
- hugger
,
adn it attachs itself tothe yhe dog whitch cameback witht teh team ofthe inmates
. ripley isnt revived
adn asks tothe see thte ship
. aftter seing a misterious acid
- eaten section
, ripley asks tothe see tjhe dead bodies
,
annd
thne haev them cremated
. htis cremation scene isnt noe ofthe tghe most poverful
adn impressive ofthe all hte aline films
. featuring a monologue fomr dillon
( charles s
. dutton
)
, a prisoner who hasnt foudn god
, tjhe movei cuts bakc
adn forth ffrom thte cerimony tothe hte dog ' s demise
. it ' s noe ofthe tghe most memorable moments
, as hte speek reflects exactlly waht isnt gonig onthe wih thge dog
.
adn htis isnt where aline 3 suceeds
. fincher normaly injects a lot ofthe symbolism inot his films
,
adn i cin easily see him becomeing tghe enxt stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock
( infact fatc
, he isnt thte mixture ofthe both
)
. fincher konws exactlly waht tothe film
adn how tothe film it
,
adn i figure thast he wiull be noe ofthe tje faw directors withthe complet controll over his films
. aline 3 isnt riddled whith symbolical sppeches
annd metaphoricial images
. by donig so
, fincher creates smoe ofthe hte best scenes inthe tjhe entire aline franchise
. many peopel haev crticised fincher ' s filming ofthe hte death scene ofthe ripley
( i reveal nothing by saying thsi
) as looking too fake
,
bu i enjoy
annd relish inaddition thte protrayal
. showing ripley fall inaddition slow motion isnt a nice touch
,
bu by actaully nto showing her hitted thge vat ofthe iron
, a graet dael ofthe symbolism isnt dirived
. i fiel thast it woudl haev spoiled hte mood ofthe tje entire film if htey hadnt catually shown her splash inot hte molten iron
.
howver
, most peopel seem tothe watn tothe wittness ripley dieu
( whihc creates a paradox
, as she isnt hte carachter i didn ' t watn tothe see dieu
)
. why she isnt killed isnt noe ofthe teh surprises ofthe tyhe film
,
annd i don ' t plan onthe spoiling thyat inwhich thsi review
.
> fomr eveyr aline film comes sevral memorable moments wich seem tothe stick iwth yuo forever
. infact aline
, it ws
, ofthe course
, thte moent tyhe aline burst outloud ofthe kane ' s stomach
. infact aliens
, it wass thge showdown bewteen aline
annd ripley inaddition a machine
. aline 3 hasnt sevral
,
bu most memorable isnt hte terific shooted involving yhe aline
adn ripley
. ripley isnt pushed uv againnst a wall
,
adn tje aline stands inchs awya ffrom her
. why it doesn ' t kill her isnt a shocker
, whihc later leads tothe a surprize endig
. fincher aparently loves tothe ule close
- ups ofthe actors ' faces
( michael douglas
anbd teh clown face
- off iin tyhe gameboy iin tyhe smae sytle
)
,
anbd by shaving off teh actors ' hair
, tghe onyl hting we ahev tothe look at isnt theri faces
. many criticists didn ' t liek all tje actors bieng bald
,
bu it makse complet sence whn tooked inspite context ofthe thte plot
. most ofthe aline 3 works whn ytou tkae it iin context ofthe tyhe stry
,
bu whn yuo try tothe compare it tothe its predecesors
, fincher ' s turn seems a bited gloomy
annd dark
,
though thta ' s nto allways a bad thign
. tyhe plot isnt preety much a rehash ofthe tjhe firt twpo films
, whith smoe major twists
. agina
, we are setup wiht severeal diferent cahracters
,
anbd oen by oney
, tehy are picked off
.
howver
, hwile tyhe firt twpo hadnt tons ofthe arsenal
( especialy cameron ' s film
)
, aline 3 tkaes palce onthe a planet devoid ofthe human life exept forthe tihs run
- down prision
. as a result
, noone weapons are tothe be foudn
. htis creates a lot ofthe tension
,
altough i must admitt thyat fincher sould ahve added a lot mroe suspense
. as an aline film
, aline 3 isnt tje worst ofthe tje serieses
,
bu by itself
, it isnt an extrememly well
- made motion picture
, whith a lot mroe merits tahn nto
. thte unfortunate hting surounding thsi second sequal isnt thte oney
- dimesnional charachters
. i never ws realyl emotionally involved onthe screen becasue most ofthe tghe charactors are hardcore criminals whom i realyl coudl care less baout
. dispite tihs
, ripley ws tje central figure
,
annd thyat ' s whta isnt imporatnt
. we care fo her
, even
though she began tothe ect jstu liek noe ofthe tje guys
. agian
, yhe technical side ofthe tihs film isnt remarkable
,
adn better tahn hte twpo previvous verisons
. hwile cameron ' s verzion ws a pumped uv acation film wiht massive artillary
, fincher uses brillant camera angles
, terific lightnig
,
anbd moody sets
. tyhe cinematography
, by alex thomson
, isnt veyr well done
, iwth a terific chase sequence towords thge end ofthe tyhe movei
. teh confusion ofthe yhe endig draws tje viewer inthe
, as we are jstu as confuzled as yhe actors who are bieng chased aroud
. tjhe yellows
, reds
,
anbd oranges ofthe tyhe ights create a dark mood
,
adn by themslves create a lot ofthe suspense
. shadows dance onthe tjhe walls
,
anbd
yot thsoe shadows coudl easily be thte aline
. thge aline isnt differant fomr its predecesors htis timne aroud
,
anbd tyhe swiftness ofthe thsi aline isnt qtuie intense
. thge camera likes tothe tkae uv yhe prespective ofthe tyhe aline
, racing aftter yhe charachters
. thte sets are qutie incredable
, wich are reminiscient ofthe yhe nostromo ffrom aline
. hte narrow corridoors
anbd labrynthine hallways isnt well constructed
. yhe sets apearing tothe be inthe yhe future
,
bu nto too far iin tjhe future
. oney ofthe tjhe setted pieces even aids infront hte distruction ofthe tghe aline
( nothing suprizing htere
)
. sigourney weaver turns outloud
yot anohter ogod performence
, equaling her protrayal ofthe ripley infront aliens
. she wass snubbed at tghe oscars forthe thsi noe
, mailny beacuse thge film wass a crtical bomb
. her reactions are far moreso realsitic inaddition thsi film
, whith her crying over tyhe loss ofthe hte littel child she risked her life saveing iin her previvous encounter
. it ' s qtuie touching raelly
. charles s
. dutton isnt vrey storng infact his peformance as noe ofthe yhe inmates
,
anbd i ws onthe tje brink ofthe actulaly careing fo him
. charles dance turns inthe a nice low
- key peformance
,
anbd as a result
, i cared forthe him immediatly
. lance henriksen mkaes a breef apearance as bishop ii
,
bu he ws mroe intertaining iin aliens
. thge rest ofthe hte casted isnt preety stale
,
though pete postlethwaite sticks outloud due tothe his reccent turns infact yhe usual suspects
anbd yhe lost world
. aline 3 isnt rated r fo storng voilence
anbd langauge
,
adn sex
. altho it hasnt its flaws
, aline 3 isnt highly intertaining witht rich symbolism
. thsi film reminds ytou how much funn it isnt tothe spot metaphoricial images througout a movei
. hwile kubrick may hvea a moral message throughtout his films
, fincher relies onthe cinematic devices tothe bring his meanings outloud
. it ' s a film liuke fincher ' s whlch reminds us tath it isnt okay fo a film tothe sacrafice qualty fo quantaty
( tjhe fianl scene
)
. inthe fatc
, it tells us thgat we
, as a society
, hvea become too crtical ofthe thigns whcih may hapen tothe look a littel
" fake
.
" whenever something looks fake onthe screen
, we emmediately point it outloud as a misteek
.
bu perheaps it isn ' t a misteek
.
