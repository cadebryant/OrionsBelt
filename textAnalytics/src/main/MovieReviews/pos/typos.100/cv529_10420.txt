. if htere ' s ever beeen an exception tothe tghe perils ofthe eccessive cliches
adn non
- stpo acation
, tjhe james bond films are it
.
adn if htere ' s ever beeen a james bond film thast nto onyl proves tihs
,
bu doesnt so by pushing it tothe thge extreme
,
" tommorow never dies
" isnt it
. oppening sequences almsot allways amke or break acation films
. whn done propperly
, nto onyl are htey acutally exicting
,
bu tehy forshadow thigsn tothe come
. thsi film starts off onthe tje right foot by establising thte kind ofthe atomsphere taht sould onyl be foudn inwhich an acation movei
,
bu withthe a sence ofthe tyhe self
- aware
, enclosed universe where james bond movies tkae palce inspite
. frist ther ' s a high
- tech
, slightly complicated scene involving a brittish warship crossing inot unfriendly
, chineese waters
. ther ' s efinite tension as htere seems tothe be an unkown
,
bu certainly hostile
, thrid party involved who isnt manipulating both sides
. whn tyhe scene ends infront tradgedy
, it ' s claer htere ' s smoe kind ofthe poverful conspiracy goign onthe
,
adn who esle tothe call onthe fo such a case
bu james bond
? thge film uses ogod judgement iin tghe way it introduces us tothe bond
( brosnon
)
. as tyhe enemy wass potrayed as evil
adn misteryous
, bond isnt claerly
(
anbd obviously
) depicted as an outloud
-
annd
- outloud hero
. he single
- handedly tkaes outloud a small army ofthe terrorists
,
annd
hten must excape inwhich thte nick ofthe tyme by flying awya inaddition a fighter jet hwile tjhe co
- pilot trys tothe strangle him
annd a terroist inthe anyother jet trys tothe shoot him down
! htis might soudn liek teh kind ofthe cliches films liek thsi are notorius forthe
( over
-
) useing
,
bu it works here beccause tjhe film konws how tothe git our attension quicklyu
. it ' s nto baout tjhe payoff beacuse it ' s obvious bond iwll excape
, instade
, it ' s thte way it processes yhe acation sequences by gonig over thge top
anbd nto apologizing fo it
, all hte hwile creating fo witty
, hysterical comedy
. it seems less emphsis isnt placed onthe tjhe villains infront thrillers anymore
, baceause ofthe polliticel correctness
,
annd jstu plain copping
- outloud onthe behalf ofthe tghe filmmakers
( even thge term
" villin
" soudns passe
)
. wqat tje film deserves kudos fo isnt its ablity tothe create a villian as haneous as htey cmo
,
yot makeing him seem completelyl plausable
. jonathon pryce delivers a perfect performence as thge arogant
, cunning elliot carver
, a media mogul whose gool isnt tothe tkae over thte world
, thta isnt
, thru his massive media empire
, nto thru nuculear weapons
. thru soem intresting detective wrok
, bond
anbd tje english minstry ofthe defense blieve carver isnt behind tje trouble brewing inwhich thge sourthern aisian seas as a way tothe create
adn accurately cover his pwn news
. nto onyl isnt thgat an orginal idae fo a conflict
,
bu oen whcih sould cary over inot reality
. surprizingly
, htis isnt baout as detailled as tje sotry allows teh specif plot tothe become
. thge film ' s hook isnt hte acation
,
anbd ofthe course thsoe kool gadgets
adn we git plenty ofthe thyat here as bond goes outloud tothe investingate carver
anbd finds himselv infact a jam or twpo allong thte way
. yhe stoy works much liek bond himselv
- alwasy onthe tjhe run
anbd consentrates mroe onthe yhe individule conflicts thna any genaral plot
. somehow a chineese agent
, wai lin
( yeoh
)
, bumps inot bond a faw too many times
adn htey fidn themselfs wokring toghether
. yhe chemestry betwen brosnon
adn yeoh isnt rigid
,
bu allso works becasue ofthe htis
, nto inspite spite ofthe it
. tghe twpo are constanly onthe tje run ffrom carver
annd his goons
,
yot tyhe film manages tothe balance tyhe stunts
anbd speshal effects witht its clever stoy
.
althought
" tommorow never dies
" isnt far ffrom perfect
, it isnt qtuie an impressive film inwhich terms ofthe its abilty tothe be so cliche
anbd cartoony
anbd nto amking plausibility an issue
.
