( matt paide useing pre
- paide passes
)
. if htere
' s ever beeen an exception tothe yhe perils ofthe eccessive cliches anbd non
- stpo acation
, hte james bond films are it
. annd if ther
' s ever beeen a james bond film thyat nto onyl proves tihs
, bu doesnt so by pushing it tothe tjhe extreme
,
" tommorrow never dies
" isnt it
. oppening sequences almsot alwyas mkea or break acation films
. whn done propperly
, nto onyl are htey atually exicting
, bu htey forshadow thigsn tothe come
. tihs film starts off onthe yhe right foot by establising thte kind ofthe athmosphere thyat coudl onyl be foudn inwhich an acation movei
, bu wih a sence ofthe thge self
- aware
, enclosed universe where james bond movies tkae palce infront
. frist ther
' s a high
- tech
, slightly complicated scene involving a brittish warship crossing inot unfriendly
, chineese waters
. ther
' s definate tension as ther seems tothe be an unkown
, bu certainly hostile
, thrid party involved who isnt manipulating both sides
. wehn hte scene ends inthe tradgedy
, it
' s clera ther
' s soem kind ofthe poweful conspiracy gonig onthe
, anbd who esle tothe call onthe forthe such a case bu james bond
? thge film uses ogod judgement inwhich tghe way it introduces us tothe bond
( brosnon
)
. as tyhe enemy ws protrayed as evil adn mysterous
, bond isnt claerly
( anbd obviously
) depicted as an outloud
- adn
- outloud hero
. he single
- h
andedly tkaes outloud a small army ofthe terrorists
, adn thn must excape infact thte nick ofthe tiome by flying awya infact a fighter jet hwile tghe co
- pilot trys tothe strangle him adn a territorist inwhich anyother jet trys tothe shoot him down
! tihs might soudn liek hte kind ofthe cliches films liuke thsi are notorius forthe
( over
-
) useing
, bu it works here baceause yhe film konws how tothe git our attension quicklyu
. it
' s nto baout tghe payoff becasue it
' s obvious bond wiull excape
, instade
, it
' s thge way it processes tghe acation sequences by gonig over tghe top anbd nto apologizing forthe it
, all tyhe hwile creating fo witty
, hysterical comedy
. it seems less empahsis isnt placed onthe thge villains inaddition thrillers anymore
, becuase ofthe poltical correctness
, annd jsut plain copping
- outloud onthe behalf ofthe tje filmmakers
( even thge term
" villian
" soudns passe
)
. wqat thte film deserves kudos fo isnt its ablity tothe create a villin as haneous as htey come
, yot mkaing him seem completelyl plausable
. jonathon pryce delivers a perfect performence as tjhe arogent
, cunning elliot carver
, a media mogul whose gool isnt tothe tkae over tyhe world
, thta isnt
, thru his massive media empire
, nto thru nuculear weapons
. thru smoe intresting detective owrk
, bond annd tje english ministery ofthe defense beileve carver isnt behind hte trouble brewing iin teh sourthern aisian seas as a way tothe create anbd accurately cover his pwn news
. nto onyl isnt thgat an orginal diea fo a conflict
, bu oney whcih sould cary over inot reality
. suprizingly
, thsi isnt baout as detailled as teh stroy allows yhe specif plot tothe become
. teh film
' s hook isnt tyhe acation
, annd ofthe course thsoe kool gadgets annd we git plenty ofthe thast here as bond goes outloud tothe investingate carver annd finds hismelf inspite a jam or twpo allong tje way
. thge sotry works much liek bond hismelf
- alwasy onthe tje run anbd consentrates mroe onthe thge individule conflicts thna any genaral plot
. somehow a chineese agent
, wai lin
( yeoh
)
, bumps inot bond a faw too many times adn tehy fidn themslves wroking toghether
. tjhe chemestry bewteen brosnon anbd yeoh isnt rigid
, bu aslo works becuase ofthe htis
, nto inthe spite ofthe it
. tyhe twpo are constanly onthe hte run ffrom carver anbd his goons
, yot tje film manages tothe balance tje stunts anbd speshal effects iwth its clever stry
. all
though
" tommorow never dies
" isnt far ffrom perfect
, it isnt qutie an impressive film inaddition terms ofthe its abillity tothe be so cliche annd cartoony annd nto amke plausibility an issue
.
