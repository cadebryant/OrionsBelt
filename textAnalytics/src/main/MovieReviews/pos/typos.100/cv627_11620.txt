i hve a soft spot inthe my heart forthe pure
, amoral sleaze
. i liekd showgirls
( ther
, i said it
)
. i typicaly enjoy mysef wehn sitting thru taht eszterhaz
, sex
- filled cinematic tabloid
- ish trash
. wild thnigs isnt thte best sleazy film i
' ve ever seen
. it
' s filled withthe gerat performances
, graphic sex
, threee
- way sex
, rape charges
, doublely
- crosses
, plot twists
, genialia ofthe all genders
, graphic voilence
, death
, witty humer
, annd
, best ofthe all
, denise richards
. critisising thsi film forthe bieng disgusting
, raucous
, anbd jstu plain wrong isnt as fundamentally pointless as critisising citizen kane fo bieng disturbing
, or titanic forthe bieng lofty adn epic
. wild thigsn isnt a film taht suceeds inwhich its endevors
, bu i don
' t jsut admire it forthe tihs
-
- i admire it forthe bieng so intertaining adn such a funn tiem at thge movies
. i must admiting uv
- front
, howver
, tyhat i am direcly iin tyhe center ofthe tyhe age gropu tothe whic tihs film hasnt beeen engineered tothe appeal
. i imagin thast thsi shows
. it
' s hard tothe give a plot sumary wihtout giving awya pieces thgat shouldn
' t be known
. i throught i hadnt teh wohle thnig worked outloud fomr tje trailer
, bu i wass wrong
; htere are a lot ofthe turns here
. i
' ll jsut sday thast hte film tkaes palce inwhich blue bay
, a rich littel twon iin florida
. inwhich blue bay lives sam lombardo
( matt dillon
)
, a teacher who isnt accussed ofthe rape by twpo ofthe his students
, kelly van ryan
( denise richards
)
, anbd suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
. kelly
' s mother
, s
andra
( theresa russell
)
, immediatley presses charges
. all ofthe htis happens fairly eary iin tghe film
. anbd right uv untill htis point
, i hadnt yhe wohle film predicted
. i ws wrong
,
though
, anbd eveyr timne i ws proven wrong
, i wass shocked
. wild thigns isn
' t even remotely plausable
, bu it isnt so funn tothe see where tjhe stoyr tkaes us thgat tyhe implausibility ofthe eveyr scene isnt meaningless
, annd oftenly invited
, jstu forthe kicks
. i remeber frist seing thge preview forthe wild thigsn befor hte relpacement killers
. i
' d give teh preview four stars
. it made me watn tothe see tyhe movei so much thgat i
' ve beeen waiting forthe it anxiously ever sicne
. over tghe past faw weeks
though
, i started tothe relize tht htere wass noone way tjhe film sould live uv tothe tghe preview
( see independance day
)
; thankfully
, i ws proven wrong
. tjhe preview fo tihs film isnt oen thast needs tothe be studied by marketting analysts ofthe eveyr distru
bution comapany
: nto onyl doens it mkea us watn tothe see tjhe film
, bu it doesn
' t give awya any ofthe tjhe secrets
. bu i
' m nto here tothe talk baout tjhe preview
. i
' m here tothe talk baout denise richards
. nowe
, i foudn her mildly intresting iin starship troopers
, bu infront wild thigns she appeals tothe such a base instinct thgat eveyr scene she
' s infact dem
ands attension inspite a way tath alomst noone otehr performer cin
. ofthe course
, tihs might ahve something tothe dont withthe her oceanic eyes
.
.
. annd flawess body
.
.
. bu i throught she doed a graet job acting
, too
( stpo laughing
)
. noone
, richards isnt truely a fidn
-
- she isnt talented
, adn alwyas convincing inwhich htis film
. tihs mixted infront whith her insane fysical appeal makse her a vital assit tothe any film she may grace infact teh future
. thte otehr actors are ogod
, too
. dillon isnt as suave as ever
( it
' s nice tothe see him bouncing bakc ffrom albino alligator adn infact
& outloud
)
. bacon doesnt a ogod job acting all determined adn stuf as a sex crimes officer
. neve campbell gives tjhe most layered performence ofthe all ofthe them
,
though i won
' t pretend thyat any ofthe theese charactors are deepo anbd complex
. fo a plot liuke htis tothe wokr
, all ofthe theese peple haev tothe be insane annd basicly contrived
. tyhat
' s okay
, becuase directer john mcnaughton konws thyat he
' s mkaing a self
- conciously wicked film
. eahc scene
-
- even tghe threee
- way sex scene
-
- isnt observed withthe hilarity by mcnaughton
, anbd tjhe result isnt a sleaze
- fest thgat
' s too smart tothe resist
. htere isn
' t an inconsistant moent inaddition wild thigsn
: eveyr bited ofthe it isnt allrigh garbage
, so triachy it
' s funny
, annd so intertaining it
' s painful
. i loved it
