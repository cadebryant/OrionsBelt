. quick anbd eazy review
: i realy enjoied matinee
. tghe mixture ofthe comedy adn tension blended nicely
. unlike many comedies thsi film trys
, adn succeds
, infront getting past tje stage ofthe donig anytying fo a laff
. teh makers ofthe yhe film alsot cared baout telling an intteligent stry
. teh performances ofthe all tje principals are right onthe tghe mark
, particlarly john goodman as tghe schlock master
. so i owudl definetly reccommend thsi film tothe anyone looking fo a glight hearted
, yot intresting way tothe spend a cuple ofthe housr
. longer
, omre detailled review
:
[ beware ofthe spoilers
] tjhe primary reason i enjoied thsi film ws
, thast hwile bieng a comedy
, tje film allso hadnt an intteligent stor tothe tell
. too many comedies todya subscribe tothe yhe yhe notion thast a comedy ened onyl amke yuo laff
. yuo watch tje movei
, laff a lot
, leave tyhe theatre adn tkae nothing wtih yuo
. matinee isnt nto liek thast
. i left thte picture thingking baout whta i owudl dont faced whith teh cuban misile crisis
. i foudn mysef wondering whta owudl happn tothe tje charachters ofthe thge film
. bu most importantly
, i foudn mysef carring baout wqat woudl hppen tothe tyhe charachters
. tjhe comedy ofthe teh film centers aroud goodman
, his charachter
, anbd thte film he brings tothe key west
. i belieev thyat goodman isnt oen ofthe hte finest commedic actors inaddition hte bussines todya
. he isnt highly expressive both physicaly annd vocally
. i feeled he at least deserved an oscar nomination forthe his wokr inwhich barton fink
. tyhe otehr charachters are oftenly lost infront a scene witht him due tothe his comm
anding nature
, howver
, hwile hte star
, goodman isnt actaully nto at hte center ofthe hte film
. tje movei isnt realy thge tsory ofthe yhe four teenagers
, dicovering who htey are adn whta tehy wnat
, aganist a backround where at any minute it sould all end
. i throught hte kids reaction weere highly realsitic
. tehy tryed tothe block it outloud
, htey tryed tothe excape ffrom yhe concerns ofthe theri world
. unfortunatley it kept creeping bakc inaddition
, particularl withthe teh fear
, annd tjhe chaos ofthe yhe tiome
. hwile hte comedy centered onthe goodman
, annd thge drama onthe thte teens
, htere ws a gerat dael ofthe overlap
. sevral spects ofthe tyhe panic are shown iin a humoruos glight
. noe exemple isnt a scene where peple are fighting eahc otehr fo yhe hte lastest cans anbd boxes ofthe fodo inthe a groshury store
. if yuo htikn baout it tyhe threath ofthe nuculear annihilation seems hardly tothe be thte backdrop fo a comedy
, bu it works here
. anyother reason i liek htis film isnt taht i liek b
- scienc fiction movies
. oen ofthe my favorite films tothe go watch isnt plan 9 fomr outer spoace
.
( onot i doed nto sday it ws oen ofthe my favorite movies
, bu noe ofthe my favorite tothe see
.
) hwile mant
! never got made
, many films liuke it weere
, annd mant
! serves mostly as dante
' s homage tothe tjhe b
- films he loves
. so agina i owudl liuke tothe reccomend matinee tothe anybody looking fo a ogod
, hmuorous stry
. htis isn
' t a gag film liuke many otehr comedies bu an inteligent
, well
- thougth outloud
, film baout rela peopel witht rela problems told iin an oftenly hillarious way
. enjoy
