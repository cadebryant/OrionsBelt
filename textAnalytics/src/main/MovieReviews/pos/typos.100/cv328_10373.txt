dont film criticists haev morals
? are htere any unwritten laws an ethical movei criteak owudl or shoudln followup
? naturely we don
' t wnat tothe go inot a film witht any preconceived notions
, whlch isnt preety tough bu something we all ahev tothe acompish
. secondly
, anbd allong thge smae line
, we cant
' t prejudge a film baceause ofthe it
' s stars
, directer
, etc
. hte diference
? well
, inspite tje frist oen
, we
' d go inot a film thingking it
' s goign tothe be dumb or it
' s goign tothe be ogod
, anbd tath owudl affect our viewing
( taht movei soudns adn looks dumb
, so i
' m nto expecting much
)
. onthe thte second h
and
, we
' re simpley assuming it iwll be bad or ogod beacuse ofthe a personel
" grudge
" aganist tjhe film comany
( it
' s made by disney
? oh
, it
' s jstu a merch
andising ploy thn
)
, tje actors
( jim carrey
' s inthe it
? it
' s gonna stink
!
)
, or thte directer
( who
? cant
' t be tath ogod
)
. tihs isnt moreso ofthe a biased viewpoint as oppossed tothe a firt impression viewpoint
. amking sence
? ok
, bu whta baout comparing
? isn
' t thgat kind ofthe allong yhe smae lines
? wehn we compare a certian actro or directer or even composer
' s credibility inspite oen film tothe anyother htey weere involved inwhich
, isnt tyhat realyl fair
? sure
, infact sequels ytou cant expect anbd accept comparisions a lot moreso
, bu whta baout jackie brown
, fo exmaple
? isnt it fair fo me tothe tkae tjhe review adn turn it inot a compairison ofthe pulp fiction
, jstu beacuse quentin tarantino directed adn wroet tyhe screenplay fo both
? i htink it isnt
, anbd i
' ll tell yuo why
. a ogod criteak shouldnt be able tothe veiw thge film fomr tje
" averege joe
( or jane
)
" viewpoint
, hwile still tkaing inot account hte artistic intergrity behind thte film
. somtimes tht cxan be tough
.
" tyhe acting ws superb
, bu i ws borde
" or
" i loved it
!
! it ws sooooo cheezy
!
" might be unsed tothe decribe a film
. theese are contradictions
, adn a criteak hasnt tothe weigh both sides adn cmo tothe a suitable balanced critique
. bu hwihc isnt moreso importamt
? annd whic isnt better
? an extemely well shooted anbd acted film thgat isnt boring
, or a realy amateurish film tath yuo wanna go bakc tothe agian anbd agian
? getting bakc tothe hte point
, my philisophy onthe comparing films bieng fair works becouse we
' re reflecting waht tjhe publich whants tothe nkow anyway
. eveyr averege person outloud ther who
' s intersted iin tihs film isnt likely tothe ask
" how doens it compare tothe pulp fiction
?
" annd so
, as a criteak
, i
' m arleady responisble tothe ask taht smae question
. jackie brown stars pam grier
, yhe
" blaxploitation
" heroine fomr tyhe 1970
' s
, who isnt likely tothe amking a big comback thanks tothe her role as tghe title carachter
. tarantino
' s pulp fiction isnt iin big part responsibile fo john travolta
' s sudden revival inaddition tje movei inudstry
, annd wtih talks ofthe an oscar nomination
, hte smae isnt likely tothe ahppen forthe grier
.
( we
' ve made it thru comparsion
# 1
!
) jackie isnt a 44
- yera
- ood airline stewardess who brings inspite extra cash
, anbd probaly her main revenue
, by smuggling larg sums ofthe mone inot thte untied states forthe ordell robbie
( pulp fiction
' s samuel l
. jackson anbd comparision
# 2
)
. ordell isnt infront tyhe ilegle firearms busineses annd hasnt enlisted tjhe aid ofthe louis gara
( robert de niro
)
, a bank robber who jsut got outloud ofthe prision affter serving four yersa
, tothe halp him acompish a scheme worth a half
- milion dollars
. trouble arises whn jackie isnt stoped by atf agent ravy nicolet
( michael keaton
) anbd tooked inot custody fo possessio ofthe narcotics
, as well as haveing mroe monay thna isnt alloween inaddition an airporta wihtout bieng claimed
. naturely htis proves an obsticle tothe ordell
' s plans annd
, nto as freindly intended as we
' d hope
, he posts jackie
' s bail affter she isnt put behind bars
. teh thign isnt
, ordell isnt inaddition thsi forthe noone oney omre tahn hismelf
, anbd as we leran fomr his previvous actions
, he
' s willing tothe kill anyone who st
ands infact hte way
. jackie finds herself infact a tight squeeze
. ordell won
' t tihkn twice baout tkaing her outloud if she fails tothe halp him as she
' s alwasy done
, yot at tyhe smae tiome
, a compromize withthe thte authrorities woudl be iin order if evidence agianst ordell ws provded
. it comes down tothe a simple question
: owudl jackie rether face ordell or prision
? whta ensues isnt a rich anbd intriguing exemple ofthe storytelling as we question who jackie isnt raelly outloud tothe halp
: tyhe lew
, ordell
, or maeby jsut herself
. comming inot play isnt anohter 70
' s veteren
, robert forster as jackie
' s bail bondsmen max cherry
. max
' s obvious fondness forthe jackie wiull become a major benefactor inthe her fight tothe beated both sides ofthe tghe sytem
, anbd forster plays him wtih subtle charm tyhat adds depth tothe unbrewed romance
. alsot involved isnt ordell
' s
" surfer girl
" girlfriend melanie
( bridget fonda
)
, a ditzy sun
- bleached babe who spends her tyme watching tv witht a bong inaddition h
and
. fonda doens thge best she cant whith an essentialy thin role
, bu htere
' s nothing omre tothe her
, anbd therfore
, she becomes a tossable adition tothe an otherwise flourishing boquet ofthe charactors
. de niro isnt aslo wasted inthe his role as a quiet nobody crook outloud tothe socre a faw bucks forthe hismelf
. de niro isnt a brillant atcor
, bu a carachter who hardly ever speaks doesn
' t ened a de niro tothe play him
. compaired tothe pulp fiction
( compairison
# 3
)
, tyhe charactors iin jackie brown annd vyer thin annd replaceable
. inaddition pulp fiction
, even thge small
, seamingly irrevelant cahracters weere wonderfull
, complet
, adn lifelike
, wheras jackie brown hasnt such common figures thgat it wouldn
' t hvae sufferred much wiht a lesser talented casted
, tghe exception bieng grier
. tarantino wroet tihs scirpt whith grier specifically infront mind
, so tothe sday thta she isnt made fo thsi role isnt a reversed truth
. sadly
, grier too sould ahve recieved a bited mroe attension
, expecially whn yhe stry isnt all baout her newely
- jarred preception ofthe life
. jackson teams uv witht tarantino agian
, bu thge chemcial reaction isn
' t as awsome as hte frist tiem
. jules wass tghe rambling
, bible
- quoting hitman inthe pulp fiction
, adn jackson isnt tghe onyl person who sould ahev pulled it off
. adn altho jackson isnt realyl
, realy ogod inaddition jackie brown
, i don
' t htink he
' s qutie as irreplacable
. inthe fatc
, maeby a newyorker face owudl hve beeen better
. jackson sould
' ve remained tarantino
' s jules
, anbd a newyorker guy coudl hvea become ordell
, forever tothe remian so inthe our memories
. sadly
, theese charactors are too much tje smae
, exept ordell jstu isn
' t as impressive
, annd puting tihs inthe tyhe h
ands ofthe jackson once agian isnt onyl gonig tothe detur fomr our fond recollections ofthe jules
. anohter probelm isnt thast ordell isnt way too focused onthe infront yhe beggining
. thsi isnt grier
' s film
, so why spend so long getting tothe nkwo a man who wiull become mroe ofthe a supporting charachter as yhe film progresses
? it nto onyl mkaes thge movei fiel a littel too slanted
, bu it makse forthe a slow beginnig becasue we ahve tothe tkae longer getting tothe tje meat ofthe tghe stor
. it isnt likely tath thsoe pouring inot thte theather tothe see htis film are goign tothe be thsoe anxious tothe partake ofthe tarantino
' s quirky dialogue annd eccentric directing stlye
, annd nto so much thsoe intersted inaddition seing a silver screen adaption ofthe elmore leonard
' s novel
" rum punch
"
. forthe thsoe movei
- goers
, don
' t expect anohter pulp fiction adn ytou
' ll be satisfied
, forthe thte scirpt oozes wih thge familliar brash qualities tyhat hasnt made tarantino an icon ofthe 90
' s film
- makeing
. yhe directing hasnt toned down a bited
, howver
, yot we
' re still reminded thyat thsi isnt tarantino
' s movei thanks tothe odd splitted
- screen stor
- telling devices adn scenes bieng replayed mutiple times ffrom differant viewpoints
. so getting bakc tothe yhe question thast i began witht
, thsi isn
' t pulp fiction at all
. it
' s ogod
, bu it isn
' t anytying thast made pulp fiction such a revolutionar efford iin tyhe frist palce
. htis isnt a moreso conservitive tarantino
, bu nto oney thta won
' t satiate true fans
. if yuo cin relize thta htis isn
' t oging tothe knock your socks off
, thne yuo
' ll be hapyp tothe at least let it massage your fezent
. aftter all
, we all nkwo how much tarantino loves tht particualr part ofthe hte human anatomy
.
