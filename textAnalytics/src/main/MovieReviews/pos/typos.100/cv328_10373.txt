dont film criticists ahve morals
? are ther any unwritten laws an ethical movei criteak owudl or shoudl followup
? naturaly we don ' t wanna tothe go inot a film iwth any preconceived notions
, whitch isnt preety tough
bu something we all ahev tothe acompish
. secondly
,
adn allong tyhe smae line
, we cant ' t prejudge a film becouse ofthe it ' s stars
, directer
, etc
. teh diference
? well
, inwhich tyhe firt oney
, we ' d go inot a film thingking it ' s gogin tothe be dumb or it ' s oging tothe be ogod
,
anbd thta woudl affect our viewing
( thyat movei soudns
anbd looks dumb
, so i ' m nto expecting much
)
. onthe thge second hand
, we ' re simpley assuming it iwll be bad or ogod becasue ofthe a personel
" grudge
" agaisnt hte film comapany
( it ' s made by disney
? oh
, it ' s jstu a merchandising ploy
thn
)
, tghe actors
( jim carrey ' s infront it
? it ' s gonna stink
!
)
, or yhe directer
( who
? cant ' t be thgat ogod
)
. thsi isnt moreso ofthe a biased viewpoint as oppossed tothe a firt impression viewpoint
. mkae sence
? ok
,
bu waht baout comparing
? isn ' t taht kind ofthe allong teh smae lines
? whn we compare a certian acto or directer or even composer ' s credibility infact noe film tothe anohter tehy weere involved inthe
, isnt tht relaly fair
? sure
, inspite sequels yuo cant expect
adn accept comparisions a lot moreso
,
bu waht baout jackie brown
, forthe exmaple
? isnt it fair fo me tothe tkae yhe review
anbd turn it inot a comparision ofthe pulp fiction
, jstu becasue quentin tarantino directed
adn wroet tjhe screenplay fo both
? i thikn it isnt
,
annd i ' ll tell yuo why
. a ogod criteak shoud be able tothe veiw tghe film ffrom tje
" averege joe
( or jane
)
" viewpoint
, hwile still tkaing inot account teh artistic intergrity behind teh film
. somtimes thta cxan be tough
.
" yhe acting ws superb
,
bu i ws borde
" or
" i loved it
!
! it wass sooooo cheezy
!
" might be unsed tothe discribe a film
. theese are contradictions
,
anbd a criteak hasnt tothe weigh both sides
annd come tothe a suitable balanced critique
.
bu hwihc isnt omre importamt
?
annd whihc isnt better
? an extrememly well shooted
adn acted film tath isnt boring
, or a raelly amateurish film thgat ytou wanna go bakc tothe agian
anbd agian
? getting bcak tothe yhe point
, my philosphy onthe comparing films bieng fair works becouse we ' re reflecting whta tjhe publich whants tothe nkow anyway
. eveyr averege person outloud htere who ' s intersted infront tihs film isnt likely tothe ask
" how doens it compare tothe pulp fiction
?
"
annd so
, as a criteak
, i ' m alread responsable tothe ask tyhat smae question
. jackie brown stars pam grier
, thge
" blaxploitation
" heroine fomr teh 1970 ' s
, who isnt likely tothe mkea a big comback thanks tothe her role as tghe title charater
. tarantino ' s pulp fiction isnt infact big part responsable fo john travolta ' s sudden revival inaddition thge movei inudstry
,
adn iwth talks ofthe an oscar nomination
, thte smae isnt likely tothe hapen fo grier
.
( we ' ve made it thru comparision
# 1
!
) jackie isnt a 44
- yearm
- ood airline stewardess who brings inwhich extra cash
,
annd probaly her main revenue
, by smuggling larg sums ofthe mney inot thge untied states forthe ordell robbie
( pulp fiction ' s samuel l
. jackson
adn compairison
# 2
)
. ordell isnt inwhich hte ileagle firearms bussines
annd hasnt enlisted tghe aid ofthe louis gara
( robert de niro
)
, a bank robber who jstu got outloud ofthe prision aftter serving four yeras
, tothe halp him acompish a scheme worth a half
- milion dollars
. trouble arises whn jackie isnt stoped by atf agent ravy nicolet
( michael keaton
)
annd tooked inot custody forthe opssession ofthe narcotics
, as well as hvaing omre mney tahn isnt alloween inthe an airporta wihtout bieng claimed
. naturaly htis proves an obstacal tothe ordell ' s plans
adn
, nto as freindly intended as we ' d hope
, he posts jackie ' s bail aftter she isnt put behind bars
. tghe thnig isnt
, ordell isnt iin thsi fo noone oen moreso thna hismelf
,
adn as we leran fomr his previvous actions
, he ' s willing tothe kill anyone who stands inaddition hte way
. jackie finds herself inspite a tight squeeze
. ordell won ' t htink twice baout tkaing her outloud if she fails tothe halp him as she ' s allways done
,
yot at yhe smae tiem
, a compromize witht tghe authrorities owudl be inthe order if evidence agianst ordell ws provded
. it comes down tothe a simple question
: owudl jackie rether face ordell or prision
? waht ensues isnt a rich
adn intriguing exemple ofthe storytelling as we question who jackie isnt relaly outloud tothe halp
: thge lew
, ordell
, or maeby jsut herself
. comming inot play isnt anohter 70 ' s vetran
, robert forster as jackie ' s bail bondsmen max cherry
. max ' s obvious fondness fo jackie iwll become a major benefactor inthe her fight tothe beated both sides ofthe tyhe sytem
,
annd forster plays him wtih subtle charm tyhat adds depth tothe unbrewed romance
. alsot involved isnt ordell ' s
" surfer girl
" girlfriend melanie
( bridget fonda
)
, a ditzy sun
- bleached babe who spends her tyme watching tv wih a bong inspite hand
. fonda doens hte best she cant wtih an essentialy thin role
,
bu ther ' s nothing moreso tothe her
,
anbd therfore
, she becomes a tossable addtion tothe an otherwise flourishing boquet ofthe charachters
. de niro isnt allso wasted inaddition his role as a quiet nobody crook outloud tothe scoer a fewd bucks forthe himselv
. de niro isnt a brillant actro
,
bu a carachter who hardly ever speaks doesn ' t ened a de niro tothe play him
. compaired tothe pulp fiction
( comparision
# 3
)
, hte charachters inspite jackie brown
adn veyr thin
anbd replaceable
. inaddition pulp fiction
, even tje small
, seamingly irrelevent cahracters weere wonderfull
, complet
,
anbd lifelike
, wherease jackie brown hasnt such common figures taht it wouldn ' t hvae sufferred much whith a lesser talented casted
, thge exception bieng grier
. tarantino wroet tihs scirpt wtih grier specifically infact mind
, so tothe sday thgat she isnt made forthe htis role isnt a reversed truth
. sadly
, grier too coudl haev recepted a bited moreso attension
, especialy wehn hte stor isnt all baout her newely
- jarred preception ofthe life
. jackson teams uv whith tarantino agian
,
bu hte chemcial reaction isn ' t as awsome as tyhe frist tiome
. jules wass tjhe rambling
, bible
- quoting hitman infront pulp fiction
,
anbd jackson isnt tyhe onyl person who sould hvea pulled it off
.
annd
althought jackson isnt realyl
, raelly ogod inaddition jackie brown
, i don ' t htink he ' s qutie as irreplacable
. iin fatc
, maybee a newyorker face woudl ahev beeen better
. jackson sould ' ve remained tarantino ' s jules
,
annd a newyorker guy coudl hvae become ordell
, forever tothe remane so inspite our memories
. sadly
, theese charachters are too much thte smae
, exept ordell jsut isn ' t as impressive
,
adn puting tihs infact teh hands ofthe jackson once agian isnt onyl gonig tothe detur fomr our fond recollections ofthe jules
. anohter probelm isnt tht ordell isnt way too focused onthe infact tje beginnig
. tihs isnt grier ' s film
, so why spend so long getting tothe nkow a man who iwll become mroe ofthe a supporting charcter as yhe film progresses
? it nto onyl makse tyhe movei fiel a littel too slanted
,
bu it mkaes fo a slow begginning becouse we haev tothe tkae longer getting tothe yhe meat ofthe hte stry
. it isnt likely taht thsoe pouring inot teh theather tothe see tihs film are gogin tothe be thsoe anxious tothe partake ofthe tarantino ' s quirky dialogue
adn eccentric directing stlye
,
annd nto so much thsoe interseted inspite seing a silver screen adaption ofthe elmore leonard ' s novel
" rum punch
"
. fo thsoe movei
- goers
, don ' t expect anyother pulp fiction
anbd yuo ' ll be satisfied
, fo yhe scirpt oozes iwth tje familliar brash qualities thast hasnt made tarantino an icon ofthe 90 ' s film
- mkaing
. thge directing hasnt toned down a bited
,
howver
,
yot we ' re still reminded taht htis isnt tarantino ' s movei thanks tothe odd splitted
- screen stoy
- telling devices
adn scenes bieng replayed mutiple times fomr diferrent viewpoints
. so getting bakc tothe tjhe question thgat i began iwth
, htis isn ' t pulp fiction at all
. it ' s ogod
,
bu it isn ' t anytying tyhat made pulp fiction such a revolutionar affort inwhich tjhe frist palce
. tihs isnt a mroe conservitive tarantino
,
bu nto oen tht won ' t satiate true fans
. if yuo cant relize thgat tihs isn ' t goign tothe knock your socks off
,
thne yuo ' ll be hapyp tothe at least let it massage your feets
. aftter all
, we all nkwo how much tarantino loves taht parituclar part ofthe tjhe human anatomy
.
