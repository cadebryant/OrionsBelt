andom surrouding tje latest installment
, hte phantom menace
. howver
, it cin
' t be ignored
. endless toys lining tghe shelfs
, endless news reports
, annd a multi
- billion doller advertising campain mkaes it all tjhe moreso difficult
. wtih tyhe levle ofthe thsi hype
, noe owudl reacll an overhyped diaster ffrom 1998

( who woudl become yhe father ofthe luke adn evenhtually become darth vader
)

, palyed by liam neeson annd obi
- wan kenobi
, plyed by ewan mcgreggor
) tothe free it
. tje phantom menace hasnt taked a literal beating fomr varios film criticists
, leaving me tothe lower my expectations somewhat
. common complaints range ffrom lack ofthe characterization
, weak narrative
, poore direction ofthe actors
, thge dated sytle
, annd too much foucs over speical effects
. still
, film criticists oftenly apply much historical theery iin regardes tothe film critisism
, much ofthe hwihc hte averege film buff doesnt nto care fo
. hence
, thsi film isnt a lot ofthe funn adn definetly an improvment over yhe previvous films
( even withthe yhe
" improvments
" inspite tghe spacial editions
)
. htere are many memorable sequences througout yhe film
, ranging ffrom thte fast adn furious
" pod race
" sequence
( hwihc isnt a tkae onthe tjhe chariot racaus inspite
" ben hur
"
) annd tyhe many fight scenes involving legions ofthe battle droids
. utilizing technolgy tht isnt ight yeras beyond anytying made befor
, speshal effects adn computers are utilisied tothe create everyting ffrom monsters tothe robots tothe amazing cityscapes wtih incredable detail
. noone marter how many times ytou watch tihs film
, yuo wiull catch something newyorker
. hte levle ofthe humour isnt a bited higer tahn hte previvous films as well
, mostly conveyed thru thte reluctant hero jar jar binks
, who belongs tothe a race known as thte gungans
. best descibed as an mr
. bean fomr thge planet naboo
, he steals tjhe sohw
. unfourtunately
, bieng taht he isnt a coputer
- generated charachter
, tells a bited baout tyhe direction ofthe yhe actors
( altho natalie portman as tje queen isnt preety effective
, as isnt jake lloyd as thte young anakin skywalker
)
. witht star wars mania at an all timne high
, ther isnt tghe risk thast teh film wiull dissapoint
( i mysef hadnt my doubts
)
, whitch thsi film doesnt hvea a tendacy tothe dont at times
. htere are a faw logic problems iwth tjhe plot
, severeal thnigs are left unchecked
, adn at times seems tothe be made onyl forthe diehard star wars fans
( altho teh apprearance ofthe thte tusken raiders mkaes forthe omre tahn a faw laughs
)
. tyhat
, anbd young anakin skywalker isnt a raelly annoying charactor
, comming off as a smarmy
, arogant brat
( wtih such an attitide
, it
' s noone wonder why he turns tothe teh dark side
)
. still
, it seems thta many peopel
, especialy criticists
, are missing thte point
. hte film isnt soem ofthe thte most funn 2 anbd a half housr thta yuo
' ll blow inwhich your life
, wich isnt something i wouldn
' t mind donig agina
. hwile it may nto ahev tjhe pyschological inpact ofthe an caademy award contendor
, who relaly cares
? tghe film isnt pure funn fomr beggining tothe end
. anbd isn
' t thyat whta realyl matters
?
