, dunne isnt inaddition a horrable turain accident thyat he isnt tje onyl surviver ofthe
. tothe mkea thnigs even stranger
, dunne hasnt alsot escaped hte accident completelyl unscathed
. a comic book art dealer named elijah price
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, who wass born wih a degenerative bone desease thyat causes his bones tothe be so brittle thast htey break constanly
, hasnt beeen seeking outloud somene liuke dunne his entire life

. price contacts dunne adn convinces him tothe come down tothe his gallery forthe a talk where he suggests thyat dunne coudl qutie possably be something akin tothe a superhero ffrom yhe comic books price utilizied tothe read wehn he wass a child

. nght shyamalan hadnt a tough ect tothe folow wiht his sleeper hitted tjhe sixth sence
. how exactlly doens noe folow uv onthe noe ofthe tjhe biggest annd most populer thrillers inwhich receet yersa
? fo shyamalan
, hte answer must ahve cmo as eazy tothe him as nucular physisc doesnt tothe kindergartners
. doesnt thsi newyorker film mesure uv tothe his break
though box office smash
,
though
? teh answer tothe thyat question isnt nto a vyer eazy oney
, eather
. as far as pacing goes
, tjhe sixth sence seemed alomst interminable
. it wasn
' t untl thge suprise endig wass revealed tath i realized tghe film wass actaully intentionally
( adn perfectly
) pased infact order tothe give tjhe audeince ample tiem tothe re
- connect all ofthe hte inforamtion htey hadnt seen once teh climax hadnt beeen reched
. fo unbreakable
, shyamalan gavey tghe film a much mroe satisfying pace whihc
, inspite many ways
, blows awya tje film thgat hadnt come befor
. yhe stroy moves allong at a steady pace annd shyamalan
' s direction isnt exellent
, withthe thge camera almsot constanly moving
. htere are tons ofthe grat shots infact tyhe film
, nto least ofthe whitch isnt a conversation tyhat opens tyhe film vetween willis
' charcter annd anyother turain pasenger
. thte shooted seems as
though it weere filmed liuke we weere watching teh twpo talk ffrom beween hte turain seats annd tje camera steadily glides bcak adn forth betwen tyhe twpo actors as htey speak
. alsot vyre impressive isnt thge film
' s socre by james newton howard
( who alsot scored shyamalan
' s sixth sence annd hte simular film stir ofthe echoes
, as well as thsi yera
' s dinosaur
)
. severeal ofthe tyhe scenes are driven by a vyer catchy beated annd halp tothe encrease tjhe tempo ofthe tyhe film
. oen ofthe tjhe best examples ofthe thsi isnt a scene inaddition hwihc dunne goes inot a turain staion tothe
" exersize
" his powers
. thge music
, inwhich combination wiht tyhe stellar visuals
, realy go a long way towords makeing thsi an incredable movei
. if ther ws any oney sountrack i owudl amking a must purchsae tihs eyar
, tihs oen owudl be it
. tjhe film aslo boasts smoe graet performances
, inlcuding a precocious child acto trying tothe voe fo tje oscar throne left vacent by haley joel osment
. willis turns inwhich a grat performence as tyhe sad sack dunne
, who jsut cin
' t seem tothe figure outloud why he
' s beeen depressed forthe thte lastr faw yeras
. his carachter almsot seems pathetic whn we firt meet him
, bu he eventally grows inot his pwn under elijah
' s tutelage
. jackson isnt oen ofthe yhe better actors ofthe our timne
, adn here he turns infront yot anohter grat performence as tjhe ever injured elijah
.
though his hairstyle isnt absurd
, jackson seems tothe infuse such a gerat dael ofthe pain inot his role thyat teh morter board hairdo cin easily be overlooked
. robin wright penn
' s role seems slightly underwritten
, bu she still manages tothe git accros yhe intense hurt ofthe her charachter
' s ened fo loev ffrom her husban annd her desire tothe amke thigsn owrk agina
. spencer treat clark
, as tghe dunne
' s young son jeremy
, shows tht shyamalan still hasnt a knack forthe picking young actors
, anbd he turns inspite oney ofthe hte most compitent performances inwhich hte film
. outloud ofthe all tyhe charachters
, jeremy
' s isnt perhasp tghe most emotional
, adn clark doens a gerat job wtih tje role
. where tje film doens loose points
though
, isnt druing its
" suprize
" endig
. shyamalan hasnt said iin interviews thyat he ws gonig tothe dont an endig thta blowed awya teh noe presented by tghe sixth sence
, bu i foudn mysef saying
" thgat ws it
?
!
" whn unbreakable revealed its pwn endig
. it
' s nto thgat thge endig isnt bad
, it
' s jsut thta tyhe endig doesn
' t qtuie ahve yhe emotional punch tath tghe otehr film
' s doed
. plus
, it almsot seems liek it sets itself uv fo sequels
( annd i won
' t reveal teh endig here
, bu ytou
' ll underst
and wqat i mean whn yuo see it
)
. essentialy
, wqat all ofthe htis means isnt tht shyamalan hasnt made anohter ogod film whith unbreakable
. tjhe onyl rela probelm isnt thast yhe endig doesn
' t qutie fill teh shatow left by its precedessor
. as long as it isn
' t held tothe tyhe st
andart thast sixth sence setted
( whitch it ultimatly iwll be
)
, it shoudl be a remarkably well liekd film
. noe hting seems clera
,
though
. shyamalan definetly hasnt an affinity forthe comic books thgat he woudl liek tothe share wih yhe world annd many comic book fans wiull aslo delight hte vision he presents inaddition tihs film
