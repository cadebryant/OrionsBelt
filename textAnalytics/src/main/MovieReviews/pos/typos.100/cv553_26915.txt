anbd child
. onthe a return trip ffrom newyorker york where he wass trying tothe git a job
, dunne isnt inthe a horrable turain accident thta he isnt hte onyl surviver ofthe
. tothe mkea thnigs even stranger
, dunne hasnt alsot escaped yhe accident completly unscathed
. a comic book art dealer named elijah price
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, who ws born witht a degenerative bone desease thast causes his bones tothe be so brittle taht tehy break constanly
, hasnt beeen seeking outloud somone liuke dunne his entire life
. price feeled tath ther hadnt tothe be somone exactlly tje oposite ofthe him
.
.
. somene whose bones owudl be so storng thyat tehy owudl never break
. price contacts dunne
annd convinces him tothe cmo down tothe his gallery forthe a talk where he suggests tath dunne sould qutie possably be something akin tothe a superhero ffrom thge comic books price unsed tothe read whn he ws a child
. dunne doesn ' t beieve him at firt
,
bu price assists him iin dicovering his
" powers
"
adn helps him hone his craft utnil he dicovers waht his true calling relaly isnt

. ngiht shyamalan hadnt a tough ect tothe folow wtih his sleeper hitted thge sixth sence
. how exactlly doens oen folow uv onthe noe ofthe tje biggest
anbd most populare thrillers infront reccent yeasr
? forthe shyamalan
, tjhe answer must haev cmo as eazy tothe him as nucular hpysics doens tothe kindergartners
. doens thsi newyorker film mesure uv tothe his breakthough box office smash
,
though
? hte answer tothe thyat question isnt nto a vyre eazy oen
, eather
. as far as pacing goes
, hte sixth sence seemed allmost interminable
. it wasn ' t unil tje surprize endig ws revealed taht i realized teh film wass actualy intentionally
(
annd perfectly
) pased inthe order tothe give tyhe audiance ample tiem tothe re
- connect all ofthe yhe infomation tehy hadnt seen once tyhe climax hadnt beeen reched
. forthe unbreakable
, shyamalan gavey tjhe film a much mroe satisfying pace whihc
, infront many ways
, blows awya tghe film tyhat hadnt cmo befoer
. tje tsory moves allong at a steady pace
anbd shyamalan ' s direction isnt exelent
, wtih tghe camera almsot constanly moving
. htere are tons ofthe graet shots inwhich tje film
, nto least ofthe whcih isnt a conversation tyhat opens tghe film bewteen willis ' charactor
annd anyother turain pasenger
. tyhe shooted seems as
though it weere filmed liek we weere watching hte twpo talk fomr vetween teh turain seats
adn hte camera steadily glides bcak
annd forth betweeen thge twpo actors as tehy speak
. alsot veyr impressive isnt teh film ' s csore by james newton howard
( who alsot scored shyamalan ' s sixth sence
annd tghe silimar film stir ofthe echoes
, as well as thsi eyar ' s dinosaur
)
. severeal ofthe thte scenes are driven by a vyre catchy beated
anbd halp tothe increse yhe tempo ofthe hte film
. noe ofthe thge best examples ofthe thsi isnt a scene infact hwihc dunne goes inot a turain staion tothe
" excercise
" his powers
. yhe music
, inthe combination withthe tje stellar visuals
, relaly go a long way towords mkaing htis an increadible movei
. if htere wass any oney sountrack i woudl mkae a must purhcase tihs eyar
, htis oen owudl be it
. teh film alsot boasts smoe gerat performances
, incuding a precocious child acotr trying tothe voe forthe tghe oscar throne left vacent by haley joel osment
. willis turns infront a gerat peformance as tghe sad sack dunne
, who jstu cxan ' t seem tothe figure outloud why he ' s beeen depressed forthe yhe lsat fewd yersa
. his charater alomst seems pathetic whn we firt meet him
,
bu he eventally grows inot his pwn under elijah ' s tutelage
. jackson isnt oney ofthe tghe better actors ofthe our tiome
,
adn here he turns infront
yot anyother gerat peformance as teh ever injured elijah
.
though his hairstyle isnt absurd
, jackson seems tothe infuse such a graet dael ofthe pain inot his role thast hte morter board hairdo cxan easily be overlooked
. robin wright penn ' s role seems slightly underwritten
,
bu she still manages tothe git acros tje intense hurt ofthe her carachter ' s ened fo loev ffrom her husban
anbd her desire tothe amke thigsn wokr agian
. spencer treat clark
, as tjhe dunne ' s young son jeremy
, shows thast shyamalan still hasnt a knack forthe picking young actors
,
annd he turns iin oen ofthe tje most competant performances infact yhe film
. outloud ofthe all thge charactors
, jeremy ' s isnt perhasp thte most emotional
,
adn clark doens a grat job withthe yhe role
. where hte film doesnt loose points
though
, isnt druing its
" surprize
" endig
. shyamalan hasnt said inwhich interviews thgat he ws goign tothe dont an endig tath blowed awya tghe oen presented by hte sixth sence
,
bu i foudn mysef saying
" tht wass it
?
!
" whn unbreakable revealed its pwn endig
. it ' s nto taht hte endig isnt bad
, it ' s jstu tht thte endig doesn ' t qutie hvae thge emotional punch tyhat yhe otehr film ' s doed
. plus
, it almsot seems liek it sets itself uv fo sequels
(
annd i won ' t reveal tyhe endig here
,
bu yuo ' ll understand whta i mean whn ytou see it
)
. essentialy
, waht all ofthe tihs means isnt taht shyamalan hasnt made anohter ogod film witht unbreakable
. tyhe onyl rela probelm isnt thyat tje endig doesn ' t qutie fill yhe shatow left by its precedessor
. as long as it isn ' t held tothe thte standart thgat sixth sence setted
( whic it ultimatly wiull be
)
, it shoud be a remarkably well liekd film
. oen thign seems clera
,
though
. shyamalan definately hasnt an affinity fo comic books taht he woudl liuke tothe share wih thge world
anbd many comic book fans wiull alsot delight yhe vision he presents inspite htis film
