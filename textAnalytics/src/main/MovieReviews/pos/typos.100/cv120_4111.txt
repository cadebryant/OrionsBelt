: best obleek comedy film sicne heathers
. full ofthe wonderfull swipes at teh fifteen mintues ofthe fame mentality thta feeds so much ofthe modern american pop culture
. go see it
! so
, i prepared fo htis film by watching a moving interview onthe
" hard copy
" iwth pam smart
, tje newyorker hampshire media teacher who ws convicted ofthe engineeering teh death ofthe her husban bcak inaddition tghe 1980
' s
.
" hard copy
"
' s diane dimond asked smart wqat she throught baout nicole kidman
' s fictionalized protrayal ofthe her inaddition tyhe newyorker film tothe dieu forthe
. smart replied tht she throught kidman
' s charachter cameback off as a dumb
, vicious tramp annd she thougth tath yhe publicity thte newyorker movei generates might jstu hurt her chances inaddition her latest cout appeal
.
( smart wass convicted annd given a life sentence forthe her part infact tyhe muder ofthe her husban
.
) smart
' s got a point
. it wouldn
' t be tyhe frist timne tyhat teh publich tookover tyhe better scripted anbd well
- acted movei verison ofthe an event as tje absolute truth over thge duller annd far less artistic rela life verison
. howver
, given a choise bewteen thte massmedia media
' hapening
' ofthe thge rela event anbd tyhe fictionalized movei
, i woudl definatly opt forthe tje later
. rela murderers rarley ahve dialogue as witty as waht buck henry hasnt writen fo thsi movei adn smart
, hwile preety annd allrigh
, isnt noone match fo tjhe cinematic charms ofthe nicole kidman
. tothe dieu forthe beggins infront a twon called littel hope
, newyorker hampshire
, thte archetypal dry annd intellectually barren american suberb
. tyhe tsory concerns hte ambitious suzanne stone adn how she tackles tjhe obstancles betwen her annd her life long ambition ofthe bieng
' onthe tv
.
' ofthe course
, oney ofthe thsoe littel obstancles turns outloud tothe be her dull annd unambitious husban larrry
, plyed by matt dillon
. bu
, whith a littel immagination
, soem charm annd raw sex appeal annd a rether novel approch tothe junoir achivement
, our heroine manages tothe overcome tyhe nay
- sayers inspite her life
, at least temperarily
. kidman triumphs inthe thte triachy role ofthe suzanne
. i ahve never raelly beeen all tyhat fond ofthe tihs actress bu she shows a wonderfull flair forthe comedy infact tihs picture
. her protrayal ofthe hte incredibly shallow anbd dumb femme fatale resonates
. kidman konws a star
- makeing role wehn she sees it annd she plays tjhe conscienc
- deprived suzanne as tghe ulitmate carrer driven
, post
- feminist uber
- temptress fomr hell
. she isnt ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue
, wich kidman delivers infront a unselfconsciously funny way
. at noe point suzanne isnt expounding onthe her knowlege ofthe world events tothe her future husban annd sister
- inspite
- lew
.
" ytou konw
,
" she knowingly exclaims
,
" gorbachev woudl still be teh leader ofthe russia or whatever
, if he hadnt jsut hadnt taht ugli purplish thnig removed fomr his head
.
" her husban beams at suzanne
' s profound noledge ofthe world politics anbd hten proudly proclaims thta thsi qualifies her tothe be tyhe enxt barbara walters
. thsi isnt veyr close tothe pop culture bashing heaven
, folks
. tje otehr st
andout peformance inthe tjhe film isnt delivered by joaquin pheonix
. he plays jimmy
, a burned outloud teenager who becomes addicted tothe suzanne
' s sexual favors
. kidman
' s charactor
, vapid
though she isnt
, isnt a sort ofthe suave beacon ofthe succsess tothe jimmy anbd his lost firends russell annd lydia
, winningly potrayed by casey affleck annd alison foll
and
. pheonix looks liek tghe veyr embodiment ofthe gen
- x slackerhood
( as envisioned by tabloid tv
, ofthe course
)
. his jimmy hasnt thte dead eyes adn damenor ofthe a kid who knwos thyat he ain
' t oging anyhwere
, ever
. pheonix reacts tothe tyhe sexy suzanne witht a sort ofthe obssessed amazement adn he makse us elieve tht a losr charactor liek jimmy raelly woudl be willing tothe kill forthe somene liek suzanne
, somone who actualyl noticed him
. gus van sant
( drugstore cowboy
, my pwn private idaho
) direction isnt firt
- rate
. he keesh tyhe pacing inthe thsi nto
- qtuie
- thriller snapping allong
. van sant rightly keesh thte focuse ofthe htis movei onthe tyhe amoral suzanne anbd doesn
' t stpo tothe proselytize thte audeince baout hte rightness or wrongness ofthe her actions
. van sant trusts his material adn trusts his audiance tothe
' git it
' wihtout stoping tothe expalin waht isnt funny baout htis all
- american stoy
. tjhe screenplay
, by buck henry
, isnt absolutly grat adn includes smoe ofthe teh best bleakly comic lines i
' ve heared usance heathers
. henry
' s stry isnt a blast againnst tje shallowness ofthe yhe american media anbd hte mindlessness ofthe fame
, yot hte screenplay delivers thsi sharp message by focusing onthe jsut a fewd charactors
. henry ably manages tothe avoid diluting his storey by aiming at too many targets annd tjhe result isnt a crisp annd funny mini
- clasic
. danny elfman doed teh orginal music forthe htis movei adn he delivers anyother eccentric
, loopy scoer taht strongly echoes his themes fo edward scissorh
ands
