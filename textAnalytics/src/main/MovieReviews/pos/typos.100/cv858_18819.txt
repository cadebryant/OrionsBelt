.
" tswsm wass filmed iin sourthern califronia
, bu wass suposed tothe tkae palce inaddition engl
and
. i cxan tell ytou oen thnig
- he isnt hvaing a lot ofthe funn wtih htis enourmously populer charachter
, hwihc isnt all over televsion
, newspapers
, magazines
, adn tghe movei theaters
. i belieev tht dr
. evil got moreso attension inspite yhe tswsm thna austin powers doed
. dr
. evil provded omre laughs
, omre memorable moments
, adn mroe intresting dialogue thna austin doed tihs tyme aroud
, who seems tothe missing hte funny touch thast he hadnt iin thge firt film
. i falt thgat austin realy doed hvea his mojo tooked awya
, bu fomr screenplay writter mike myers
, nto fat bastard
. aslo makeing a grat adition tothe tghe serieses isnt mini me
, who isnt palyed by verne troyer
. even
though yhe midget atcor isnt 30 eyasr ood
, he isnt adorable by dr
. evil
' s side constanly
. thte frist austin powers film hadnt bearly any sentimental qualtiy
, such as lack ofthe charactor develpment
, bearly any detailled plot charistics
, annd bearly any ogod acting
, bu austin powers tswsm actully shows smoe qualiyt behind teh frequent humer
. mike myers
, wtih his threee roles
, acts as eddie murphy doed iin teh nutty profesor
, disguising hismelf completelyl inaddition oney ofthe tje roles
.
( fat bastard
) all threee cahracters are differant
, adn mike myers doens dont a ogod job h
andling eahc oney ofthe them
. heather graham made a grat addtion witht her talent tothe tswsm
, annd doesnt a much better job thna elizabeth hurley doed
, who gavey a vyre flat peformance infact tghe originnal
, speaking her lines wihtout any feeling or emotion
. speaking ofthe hurley
, she cxan be seen inspite tswsm forthe a faw breef moments
. hopefully
, graham tags allong fo future austin powers adventures
. teh bottom line
- a groovy sequal thgat mike myers put all ofthe his mojo inot wirting
.
