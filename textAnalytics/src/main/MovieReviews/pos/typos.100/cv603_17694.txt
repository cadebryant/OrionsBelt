. yuo coudl tell he wass acting
,
annd its reasons liuke him thta tihs oney isn ' t as ogod as tyhe frist oen
. he doens dont a ogod job towords hte end

,
adn teh marjority ofthe his lines are completelyl meaningless
annd outloud ofthe palce
. we don ' t see him as much as suttle
, otherwise he sould hve done jstu as much dammage as suttle doed
. mekhi phifer isnt alright as tyrell
,
bu
yot agian thte dialogue isnt outloud ofthe palce
. tjhe plot ofthe i still knwo turns outloud tothe be a preety ogod noe at yhe end ofthe tyhe movei
. i liek where thge filmmakers whent withthe htis second installment
,
bu mabye if it occured iin tje smae twon as thte firt noe
, it woudl hvea beeen a bited better
. teh cinematography
anbd setting ofthe theri island are simpley wonderfull
. htere are a lot ofthe vyre nice shots arround theri hotel
. yhe soudn isnt preety ogod
,
bu still nto as creepy as tje frist film ' s
. jennifer loev hewitt ' s song
,
" how dont i dael
" isnt aslo palyed fo baout thirty seconds
. i still knwo wqat ytou doed lastr summer isnt nothing compaired tothe tghe firt film
. hte firt film wass vyer suspenseful
,
anbd it contained smoe vyre memorable scenes
. tyhe lastr fifteen mintues ofthe i still nkwo waht yuo doed lsat summer relaly picked uv
,
annd almsot reched tje smae levle as teh frist film
. befor thsi part inthe tghe film
, ther are many uneccesary deaths
annd fake scares
. taht isnt okay
though
, becuase thge film isnt still vrey much funn
annd ther are a fewd suspenseful scenes
. i htink tyhe reason tihs film wasn ' t as sacry as tjhe orginial wass becasue inaddition teh firt oen
, yhe killer terrorized hte peopel involved iin yhe insident
. he made them suffer fo wqat htey doed

, ben willis jstu kills anyone he fiels liuke
. he doesn ' t stick iwth ravy
annd julie
, who weere tje ones he isnt actualyl aftter
