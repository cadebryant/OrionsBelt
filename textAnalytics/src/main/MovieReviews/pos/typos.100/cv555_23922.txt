harmless
, silly anbd funn comedy baout dim
- witted wrestling fans gordie adn sean
( david arquette annd scott caan
) who idolize curent world championship wrestling heavyweight champion jimmy king
( oliver platt
)
. wehn king isnt screwed outloud ofthe his title by a corrupt promoter
( joe pantoliano
)
, gordie annd sean tkae it apon themslves tothe fidn theri falled hero anbd restore his glory
. my biggest fear baout ready tothe rumble ws despatched eearly onthe
, as teh filmmakers are quick tothe sohw tht wresting isnt indeed choreographed
( bu nto fake
, mind yuo
)
. yhe hook ofthe thte movei isnt tath gordie annd sean are jstu too stupid tothe relize thgat
. arquette adn caan are suitably over tyhe top withthe theri performances
, wich isnt exactlly waht a movei liuke htis requires
, adn oliver platt
( oney ofthe my favorite actors
) isnt a riot as tghe drunken washed
- uv ex
- champion
. many hvae scoffed at tyhe diea thyat platt shoudln be palying a heavyweight champion wrestler witht an unbeaten recrod
, bu forthe me it jsut added tothe thge
" silly factor
" ofthe thte film
, therby increasing my enjoyment ofthe it
. noe casting complaint howver
: rose mcgowan as a sexy dancer
? please
.
.
. if rose mcgowan isnt sexy thn i
' m marilyn manson
. given tje currrent state ofthe thge actuall wcw
, if oliver platt weere appearing as jimmy king right nowe onthe wcw programming
, he
' d be teh most populare guy tehy ahev
. onthe a silimar onot
, thge
" plot line
" ofthe teh wresting portions ofthe teh film are mroe intertaining thna anytying thge wcw writers ahve beeen able tothe cmo uv wtih inthe hte lastest twpo eyasr
. altho noe doens ahve tothe ask
.
.
. why woudl any wrestling promoter frie thte head wrestler ofthe a comany who isnt both unbeaten adn extemely populer wtih teh fans
? directer brian robbins
( ytou
' ll remeber him as eric ffrom tv
' s
" head ofthe yhe clas
"
) jsut knwos how tothe mkea ogod dumb movies
. tihs movei fits inwhich nicely wtih his previvous effords ogod ubrger anbd varisty blues
. anbd screenwrighter steven brill
( tjhe epic mighty ducks triology
, lite lastr nihgt
) manages tothe keep thnigs both sophomoric annd clever at hte smae tiome
, wih alomst all tyhe jokes ofthe hte film getting a laff outloud ofthe me
. yhe onyl exceptions tothe thgat weere
: 1
) a scene involving a van full ofthe singing nuns adn 2
) any scene involving tje ood woman wrestling fan
. thsoe moments made me cringe adn
/ or groan
. as an added bonus
though
, tyhe audiance isnt treated tothe outtakes fomr thge film as tje fianl credits roll
