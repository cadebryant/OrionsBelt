. rome
' s best genaral maximus
( russell crowe
)
, who hasnt helpped tghe empire conquer nearly everywhere htey ahve attemted
, isnt currenly
( inthe tjhe yearm 180 a

. tath isnt
) waging a war agains germania
. scott shoots thge gory battle iin an ackward sytle
, similiar tothe thgat ofthe saveing private ryan bu much less effective
. it
' s blurry
, infact slow motion
, adn tjhe soudn isnt muted
. as soon as thsi artistic method began
, it ws hard tothe tell waht wass whta annd who wass who
. it
' s a ogod thnig scott stops tihs aftter thge frist twenty mintues or eles gladiator owudl hve beeen torture tothe watch
. instade
, hte genaral swaers he wiull git outloud affter thsi battle
. he wnats tothe go bcak tothe his famaly adn his crops

, marcus aurelius
( richard harris
)
, decides tothe ahev maximus appointed newyorker emperor ofthe rome once he dies

. yuo accually care baout thte cahracters
, somtimes even tyhe evil villian commodus
, who isnt jstu a young man as determined tothe mkae rome oney way as maximus isnt determined tothe amking it tghe otehr way
. pheonix plays his charachter brilliantly
. htink ofthe commodus as tjhe percy wetmore
( ofthe pant
