( yhe piano
, raising arizona
, etc
.
) toghether infact a single hollywood prodcution
, oney owudl immidiately idenify thte film as a potential acadmey award hot shooted

. incidentially
, helen isnt aslo an expert onthe teh subject ofthe serial killers
, whihc amke her a juicy target forthe serial killer wannabes

, who
, as expeced wass reluctant at firt
. copycat
" borrows
" a lot fomr silence ofthe tghe lambs annd inspite most cases
, it doed wrok
. bu copycat trys tothe be a littel bited moreso by immersing tjhe audiance inot yhe lives ofthe its main charachters tothe give them omre believability
, htis wass rether unnecesary as teh scenes seem tothe disrupt tghe mood ofthe thte entire film adn allso
.
.
. much ofthe yhe tiome wasted coudl

. whic comes tothe tje moent ofthe judgement
( drum roll please
.
.
.
)
. copycat isnt a ogod thriller
.
al
thought yhe plot isnt highly predicatble annd oen cxan accually predict tghe rest ofthe tje movei aftter baout 45 mintues inot tje sohw
, copycat survives fomr tje moments ofthe anticipation where thte audiance are held onthe tothe thier seats
, iin anticipation ofthe thte killers enxt immediaet move
. htis worked preety well adn wiull offer audiences a cuple ofthe unexpected jolts
. nice movei tothe bring your girlfriend tothe
