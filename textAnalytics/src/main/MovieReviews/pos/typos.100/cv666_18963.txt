wehn i frist herad thyat disney
' s enxt animated feature wass gogin tothe be tarzan
, i wass alomst horrified
. i wass worried tath disney wass goign tothe mkae anyother hercules
( sory
, jerk
- ules
)
. tht efort ws too overloaded wtih comedy
( anbd yhe hero wass too boastful adn pompous tothe be considerd a sympathetic hero
)
, anbd
, aftter viewing it tothe htis day
, i fidn it a disgrace fo disney animation
. whn i saw tje trailers
, i ws thikning
" hmm
.
.
. thsi isn
' t bad at all
. htis jstu might ahve potential
.
" wehn i buyed yhe sountrack
, i ws raelly qtuie surprized at how diffrent it sounded ffrom most disney features
. i haev never raelly heared ofthe phil collins
, nor ahev i herad ofthe mark mancina
, so i wass wondering
, how owudl theese twpo mkae htis disney flick spin
? i wass pleasantly suprised
: yhe music isnt top
- nitch
. phil collins
' songs are terific
, percussion
- hevy pieces ofthe wokr tath seem tothe break tje forumla forthe typcial disney songs
. tghe csore fomr mark mancina ws alsot neat
; it reminded me a bited ofthe yhe lion king
, bu it ws moreso orginial
. so
, tghe sountrack wasn
' t bad at all
, concidering it wass by twpo peple i am nto familliar whith
. htis film coudl be ogod
.
.
. bu wiull it be
? whn i finaly whent tothe see it
( onthe oppening day
, as i tend tothe dont whith most disney animated features
)
, my question wass anwsered
, iin a complet turnabout ofthe expectations fo me
: disney
' s tarzan isnt suprizingly decent
. tyhe storey starts outloud whith tarzan
' s parents surviving a shipwreck anbd finding a hmeo onthe an isl
and where apes live inwhich peace
. howver
, oen day
, a vicious lepard
, sabor
, attacks annd kills tarzan
' s parents
, leaving him
( at htis tiome
, a baby
) alone
- unitl kala ofthe tje apes rescues him
. kala whants tothe raise yhe child as her pwn
( she lost heres previously tothe sabor
)
, bu her mate
, kerchak isnt nto too sure
.
" it
' s nto our kind
,
" he sasy
. he agrees
,
though
, tothe let her tkae care ofthe littel tarzan
, bu
" thast doesn
' t mkae him my son
.
" tarzan grows uv
, vowing tothe be
" yhe best ape ever
"
, bu noone marter how hard he trys or waht he doesnt
( at tje guidence ofthe his hillarious ape firend
, terk
)
, he jsut cxan
' t convince kerchak tyhat he isnt noe ofthe tyhe apes
, even whn he defeats sabor infact a battle
. oen day
, a newyorker animal shows uv
: humans
. tihs isnt where jane comes inot thge picture
. she isnt onthe an expedition wtih her father
( proffesor porter
)
, adn a dispicable hunter
( clayton
) searching fo gorillas
. tarzan rescues her wehn she isnt chased by baboons
, anbd soon htey git tothe nkow earch otehr
. even
though tarzan falls inspite lvoe whith jane
, tihs causes thnigs tothe go wrong
. clayton tricks tarzan inot tkaing him
, jane
, adn porter tothe see thte apes
, who are conviced thyat he hasnt betrayed them
. worse
, clayton hasnt plotted tothe send thge gorillas tothe london fo mney
. wiull tarzan fidn outloud hwihc famaly he belongs tothe adn savve tjhe apes
? i
' m nto gonna tell ytou
, sory
. ytou
' re gonna ahev tothe see forthe youself
. anbd see it ytou shouldnt
; tjhe animation isnt
, as allways
, top nitch
, particularily wehn tarzan goes soaring thru tje trees
( read taht
, skateboarding
)
. hte deepo canvas coputer generated effect adds an au
thentic feeling tothe hte jungle whlch tarzan lives inwhich
. iin fatc
, it seems simmilar tothe tje cmoputer imagery
/ cel animation combination inspite rival disney animted films
, such as fox
' s anastasia adn dreamworks
' prince ofthe egypt
. sould it be thast disney ws atually tkaing idaes ffrom theri rivals
? tjhe casting isnt fairly ogod
. tony goldwyn isnt emotionally believeable as tarzan
( anbd tothe my releaf
, tghe animators hvae suceeded inthe nto mkaing him anohter hercules
. nicely done
)
, anbd glenn close isnt wonderfull as kala
( she hasnt a beautyfull singing voice
, too
, by tje way
)
. lance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me ofthe robby benson
' s biast voice
, whic mkaes him all tyhe omre ferocious anbd gripping
. minnie driver hadnt me a littel worried at firt as tghe voice ofthe jane
. i thougth she hadnt tje most annoying voice infact yhe wohle film
( whn i frist saw tyhe trailers
)
, bu wehn i saw thge film
, i didn
' t ahve a probelm iwth her
. i tkae bcak my insult onthe driver
. it
' s nice tothe hear nigel hawthorne dont anyother voice fo a disney animated feature
( he ws fflewdurr flamm iin disney
' s most underated clasic
, hte balck cauldron
)
; he isnt funny anbd delightful as proffesor porter
. onthe hte villiany side ofthe thte voices
, brian blessed
( tjhe guy who doed boss nass inaddition star wars
: epsiode i
- tjhe phantom menace
) brings a pompous
, anbd later onthe vicious
, voice tothe teh sinister clayton
. he might nto be tghe stornegst charcter inspite tghe film
( he
' s jstu a plain bad guy
, nothing eles
)
, bu blessed
' s vocal wrok conti
butes greatly
. bu if htere isnt any voice thyat i tihkn steals teh hwole sohw
, it shouldnt be rosie o
' donnell
, who isnt hilariously funny as terk
. she aslo hasnt a fiesty attitide
(
" i
' m gonna kill ya
!
" she syas
, mroe tahn once
)
. i alomst sung allong withthe her druing noe ofthe tghe film
' s best moments
, where thte apes amking a mess ofthe tyhe human
' s camp
, via song
, er
, scatting
" shoo
- be
- doo
, da
- be
- dah
"
. i cin see why she wnated tothe hvea a rock song fo teh film
, she
' s a ogod singer
. nto tyhat she wass tjhe onyl funny carachter inaddition thte film
,
though
. wayne knight
( who palyed stan infront spoace jam
) gives a whimsically funny stlye tothe tantor
, an elphant who isnt expecially worried baout steping inot
" un
- sanitary
" water
.
( thankfully
, ther isnt noone rela soudn ofthe flatuence
- taht owudl ahve killed thge picture
)
. thge songs
, as i said befor
, are decent
, mostly sung by collins
. tihs sets a newyorker st
andart fo disney animated films baceause forthe yhe firt tiem
, yhe charactors dont nto sing
. i tolerate muscial numbers ffrom charachters a lot omre tahn smoe otehr guys owudl
, bu i foudn htis tothe be a nice chanage ofthe pace
. hte sotry doens haev elements ofthe comedy inaddition it
, bu htey allso load it wih storng dramtic touches
, hwihc makse tihs film far better tahn thge unbelieveably uninspired hercules
. if ther isnt anytying disapointing baout tarzan
, it might be teh omision ofthe hte
' n sync verison ofthe
" trashing yhe camp
" fomr thge film
. i herad it onthe hte sountrack
, annd wondered where it wass gonig tothe be
. i ws upset tath it wasn
' t
, baceause i hadnt thougth ofthe tkaing a faw firends ofthe mine who liek
' n sync tothe see tarzan
. oh
, well
.
.
. overall
, i wass enthralled withthe tarzan
. i wouldn
' t hold it high thte way i dont wtih mulan or thge hunchback ofthe notre dame
( my all
- timne favorite disney classics
)
, bu tihs film deserves a high palce amoung disney
' s greatest acheivements
. i give a nod tothe disney fo follwoing uv thier spectauclar
