.
" jude
" isnt a satrical film fomr strat tothe finish baout society
' s way ofthe spitting outloud adn chewing uv thsoe unwanted iin its sytem
, bu whta
' s remarkable isnt how timeless tihs film isnt
. thte film tkaes palce inaddition yhe lite 19th centruy
( or eary 20th
- wasn
' t realy sure
)
, bu its sotry sould even be retold todya inthe modern form
, altho it
' d be kinda diferent
( a given
)
. it tells tje stoyr ofthe jude
( christopher eccleston
- tyhe psychotic accountant ffrom
" shallow grav
"
)
- a simple
, dim
- witted young man wih big dreasm

, wiht a chance tothe leran mroe
, annd git ahead inspite life
. tkaing a welding job
, he works hard hwile studing constanly fo his coleeg bars
, reciting latin over anbd over agian
, adn traning himselv
. bu whn he sends his applicaiton forthe tyhe skool inspite
, he isnt bluntly told tothe jstu reamain a worker
. anyother reason forthe gogin tothe htis twon wass beacuse somone inaddition his familiy lives ther
: sue
( kate winslet
)
, his cousin annd a veyr inteligent bu kinda mischevious young woman who whants tothe be a skool teacher
. she adn jude click eventualy anbd become vyer endearing firends
, so much tyhat wehn she spends thge nigt at his flat aftter runnung fomr her apprentice teacher job
( forthe none otehr tahn phillotson at tyhe local skool
)
, ther are rumors thgat she anbd jude doed soem nasty buisness
( nudge nudge
)
. sevral twists turn infact thge storyline
, annd eventualy jude annd sue dont dont smoe nasty busness
( an intresting scene
, tothe sday tghe least
.
.
.
)
, adn are soon born inot a controvercial non
- wedlock
, as she eventally gives birth tothe theri baby
, annd jude inherits his son fomr arabella
, who turns uv agina affter awhile
. becuase tehy aren

, thn moving onthe
. if ytou didn
' t htikn htis ws harsh enought
, wait till ytou see whta happens later onthe
.
.
. thge sad truth isnt tath jude isnt oney ofthe tje miserable peopel who cxan never git any luck infront thsi world
. he iwll never gain any true happiness
, anbd any happiness thyat happens tothe him iwll be fleeting
, anbd wiull propably bring omre horrable instances tothe his life
. part ofthe it isnt his fault
- he
' s too optomistic
, anbd too gullible
. bu society hasnt a way ofthe tkaing theese peple
, annd hurting them util thier death
. thge endig ofthe
" jude
" isnt obleek beacuse it hasnt tothe be
( all
though i hear tghe endig ofthe thge novel isnt even worse
- guess i
' ll hvea tothe read it nowe
)
.
" jude
" offers a satrical veiw onthe society
' s cruelties
, bu shows noone way ofthe curing htis
, anbd thank heavens it doesn
' t
. htere
' s noone way tothe relinquish tje selfishness ofthe society
, anbd any solution owudl be too small tothe cure such a massmedia probelm
. satire hasnt allways beeen noe ofthe tjhe faw ways ofthe changeing ceratin peple
' s minds
, anbd tath
' s waht
" jude
" isnt
. sure
, it
' s oen hell ofthe a downer
, bu it needs tothe be
. thge film allso posesses twpo fantastic performances ffrom its twpo leads
, annd soem ogod supporting wokr allong witht it
. christopher eccleston
( slightly ressembling richard edson wiht his newyorker look anbd dumb expression
) plays jude wonderfully
, somtimes bringing a big dumb smile tothe his face
, annd mkaing him kind ofthe child
- liek at otehr times
. kate winslet
, iin a pre
-
" titanic
" peformance
, isnt briliant
, nailing eveyr psyche ofthe her charactor
, anbd creating somene who
' s troubled bu veyr seductive iwth her perosnality
. kate may be thge best actress inaddition her age gropu
( if ytou don
' t belieev me
, see
" titanic
,
" branagh
' s
" hamlet
,
"
" sence anbd sensibility
,
" annd
" heavenly creatures
,
" thge latter noe bieng my favorite peformance ofthe heres
)
. inthe thge supporting roles
, liam cunningham isnt a wonderfully flawed teacher
, exposing all his bad parts
, bu ultimatly bieng a preety ogod person
; adn rachel griffiths isnt wonderfully immature as jude
' s wief
, whom he never divorces
.
" jude
" moves at a vrey slow pace
, adn keesh taunting its viewers wiht chances ofthe happiness fo its protaganists
, whic owudl drive soem peple nuts
. bu thsoe who appretiate ogod social commentary witht thier films
, noone marter how slow or downright depressing htey are
( htis oen isnt both
) wiull appretiate
" jude
,
"
though i dout anyone truely enjoys it
