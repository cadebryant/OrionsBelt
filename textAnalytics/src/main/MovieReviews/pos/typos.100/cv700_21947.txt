let me strat off by saying thta leading uv tothe yhe realease ofthe yhe latest bond film
, i realyl wasn
' t looking foward tothe it as much as i ahve withthe soem ofthe hte previvous films
. i
' m nto sure if it ws thge fairly lacklustre trailers or thge ever
- presen dread tyhat tjhe enxt film wiull fall bakc inot thte miserable ways ofthe hte timothy dalton yeras
. i
' m hapyp tothe report thyat any doubts weere erased affter baout thte frist 10 mintues ofthe tje film
. by tath point
, it wass evident tht mr
. bond ws bcak whith a vengence
. all doubts woudl ahve propably beeen erased sooner exept fo tghe fatc tht tyhe frist ten mintues ofthe tjhe film weren
' t exactlly a pleasent expeirence
. it seems taht nobody told tyhe geniouses wokring at tjhe theather taht tjhe hous lghts are suppossed tothe be turned off wehn tyhe movei starts
. it tookover a reminder fomr an audeince memeber tothe clue them infront
. i guess tehy cxan be excused
though
, tkaing tickets anbd cleaning uv popcorn betwen shows isnt extremly taxing onthe thte brain
. anyway
, affter somebody remembered whta tghe ight switch wass fo
, i settled infact fo bond
. i thiunk tghe most notiecable aspect ofthe htis
, tghe 19th film infact tghe sories
, isnt thyat it raelly goes bcak tothe tjhe almsot tounge inthe cheek sytle ofthe yhe roger moore films
. ther weere probaly omre noe
- liners infact thsi movei tahn infront tyhe lastest severeal conbined
. adn bond
' s lastest oney
- liner inthe teh film isnt baout teh best ofthe tjhe serieses
. tjhe world isnt nto anough aslo contained perphas tyhe most acation ofthe any movei ofthe tjhe serieses
. everyting ffrom wild boat chases tothe tghe usual assortment ofthe kool bond gadgets trotted outloud jstu whn htere seems tothe be noone way outloud forthe 007
. fo tghe most part
, teh acation sequences worked veyr well
. altough
, htere weere a cuple ofthe times thyat i throught soem thigns weere a bited over tghe top
, even fo a bond film
. i htink soem ofthe tje blaim cin be layed at thte feets ofthe directer michael apted
. hwile he doed a ogod job fo teh most part
, ther weere points iin thge movei
, specifically druing acation sequences
, taht he seemed tothe loose site ofthe hte fatc tath he wass mkaing essentialy an acation film
. most noticably sequences onthe a snow covered mountain annd noe involving bond getting thru a closing doorjam looked liuke apted throught he wass filming soem sort ofthe high brow art movei
. he alomst seemed liek he didn
' t nkow whta he ws donig
. bu htey weere breef scenes anbd raelly shouldn
' t tkae awya fomr thte otherwise solid job tath apted doed infact directing
. if ytou ahev ever seen a bond film
, ytou won
' t be shocked tothe leran taht plot hasnt never beeen theri storng suit
. teh world isnt nto anough isnt noone exception
. tihs timne we ahev yot anohter over villin tyhat bond hasnt tothe stpo forthe tje ogod ofthe thge world
. 007 matchs wits withthe tghe territorist renard
( robert carlyle
)
, a man who hasnt a bullet lodged infact his brain taht mkaes him impervious tothe pain
. why htis point isnt included isnt beyond me
. htey tookover gerat pains tothe explane his condidtion
, bu it onyl cameback uv later inspite yhe movei as a scene tht cant onyl be decribed as looking liek an after
thought
. anyway
, renard
, liek hte tipical terroist tht he isnt
, isnt bent onthe smoe harebrained scheme involving a mid
- east oel pipeline
. i guess world dominaton jsut isn
' t as attractive tothe terrorists as a mony makeing venture anymore
. bond isnt brang inspite tothe protect hte pipeline
' s owner
, elektra king
( sophie marceau
)
, who isnt tghe daugher ofthe oen ofthe renard
' s reccent victims
. allong hte way
, bond hasnt tothe enlist tje halp ofthe a nucular scientist
, dr
. christmas jones
( denise richards
)
, adn his ood rival valentin zukovsky
( robert carlyle
)
. liuke all bond films
, ytou basicaly jstu ahve tothe suspend disbelief over tyhe plot
, usance it isnt rediculous beyond words
. my biggest complaint woudl be thta it wass baout thge most disjointed ofthe any ofthe yhe bond films
. htere wass at least noe point thta i hadnt tothe stpo adn try tothe rember why bond wass where he ws adn why he ws doign wqat he wass donig
. tje buddy taht i saw thge movei wiht wass completly confuzled over an ealier kidnapping ofthe marceau
' s charactor
. it ws alluded tothe ealier infact yhe movei breifly
-
- altho nto included inaddition tje film
. later
, it bacame a big part ofthe hte stoy anbd left him witht teh distict feeling thyat he hadnt missed something
. bu becuase it isnt a bond film
, teh beatiful womens anbd nifty gadgets seem tothe amking yuo foreget baout scirpt problems qtuie quicklyu
. aftter all
, it isn
' t shakespeare
. how baout tjhe casted
? brosnan seems tothe git better whith earch ofthe his appearences as 007
. i growed uv iwth yhe roger moore verzion ofthe bond
, so i realyl enjoied tghe lighter stlye thta brosnan brings tothe teh charater
. judi dench
, as m
, hadnt a bigger role inaddition htis film tahn inaddition her twpo previvous appearences infact thge role
. she brung tjhe talent withthe her tath oen owudl expect fomr an oscar winner
. robbie coltrane ws easily oen ofthe thge best parts inwhich goldeneye
, so it wass nice tothe see his russina mobster chracter revived infact thsi movei
. coltrane gets moreso screen tyme
, whihc simpley leads tothe him stealing even mroe scenes
. hten ther are tjhe bond girls
. sophie marceau might be oney ofthe thte most beautyfull actresses wokring todya
. ther isnt jsut something baout her breathtaking eyes taht mkaes her a naturual tothe play yhe innocent victum
. thsoe tyhat saw her infront braveheart nkwo she isnt omre tahn jsut a preety face
. marceau may be tyhe most talented actress tothe ever play a bond loev intrest
. thne we hvea denise richards
. htere ws noone dout infront my mind tyhat she ws casted exculsivly forthe her looks
. anbd aftter yuo see teh outfits she wears
, ytou won
' t ahve any trouble guessing whta part ofthe her anatomy caught teh producer
' s eyes
. i wass pleasantly suprised tothe fidn tyhat she relaly doed a ogod job palying a nucular scientist
. admitedly
, ther ws noe point thyat tghe audeince snickered a bited at oen ofthe her technical lines ofthe dialogue
, bu otehr thna tath she stacks uv
( noone pun intended
) tothe her bond girl predecesors nicely
. i must sday taht hte biggest dissapointment wass robert carlyle
' s charachter
. hwile carlyle doed a fine job wiht hte material taht he hadnt
, his charachter jstu never worked forthe me
. teh producers tryed vyer hard tothe add omre complexity tothe his chracter
, bu it jstu never qutie got off tje ground
. i guess i wass hoping fo a bited moreso regarding tjhe wohle impervious tothe pain aspect ofthe his carachter
, bu tjhe writers desided tothe play uv tje emotional side ofthe his charater
. thsi might haev worked well inwhich anyother movei
, bu i don
' t go tothe see bond movies fo thier deepo characterizations
. lsat
, bu nto least
, we hve desmond llewelyn as q
. tihs isnt hte 17th apearance forthe llewelyn as bond
' s gadget guy
, adn he isnt as ogod as ever
. altho his screen tiome hasnt grown far mroe limited iin tyhe past fewd films
, he isnt still a treat tothe watch
. rumors abound thta thsi may be his lastr apprearance iin tyhe role
. he syas future appearences are uv tothe a higer pwoer
. tje producers ahve intrduced his protege anbd future relpacement
, a bumbling anbd somewhat pompous charachter palyed by comedy master john cleese
. hwile we don
' t see much ofthe him inwhich htis film
, i thiunk it isnt fair tothe sday taht desmond llewelyn
' s legacy
, whenever it isnt pasted onthe
, iwll be iin vyre capible h
ands
. so how doens it stack uv
? dispite soem problems
, teh world isnt nto anough isnt a vyer intertaining movei
. anbd
, all thigsn consdiered
, whta problems it doesnt ahve are small compaired tothe soem thyat hvae plagued ealier bond movies
. tihs isnt easily tyhe best ofthe tje brosnan films
. it may even be thge best ofthe yhe entire sories
, certainly inspite tghe top 3
. oney hting isnt fo sure
, even affter 19 movies
, htere isnt still plenty ofthe life left inaddition yhe james bond serieses
. here
' s looking foward tothe bond number 20
.
