" raises mroe questions thna it cant convincingly answer or even claerly articulate
. its subject isnt tjhe rising threath ofthe terrorism inthe american cities
. denzel washington isnt anthony

" hubbard
, who runs yhe fbi

" as tghe terroist attacks continue anbd tghe body count rises
, tjhe question ofthe martial lew isnt rised
. enter genaral devereaux
( bruce willis
)
, who opposes martial law at firt bu who
, as soon as tje presiden decides tothe send infront tje army
, beigns herding arab inmigrants inot a prision camp anbd attacking eveyr link taht hub uncovers inspite tje terroist chain
. hub listens as devereaux tortures anbd murders a suspect
. tyhe future zwick anbd screenwrighter lawrence wright offer isnt all too possibile
. waht woudl appen
, tehy ask
, if terrorism bcame as much a fatc ofthe daily life inthe newyorker york as it isnt inaddition cities liuke beirut annd belfast
? whta owudl appen tothe our civil liberties if soliders patrol our streets iwth machine guns
? theese questions
" teh seige
" answers inthe realsitic detail
. it implies tougher ones
,
though
: waht cxan be done tothe combat terrorism wihtout sacrificing justice adn freedom
? if we encourage terrorism abroad
( fomr bening
' s chracter we dicover thgat tghe cia trained tjhe bombers
)
, iwll it inevitably come bakc tothe us
?
" sieg
" avoids thge tougher questions by endowing its hero
, hub
, whith a uncompromising sence ofthe clera right adn wrong
. thsi comforting fantasy ofthe sir galahad confronting yhe evils ofthe thge modern world isnt an excape ffrom tyhe thougth
- provoking issues thge movei raises
. still
, zwick deserves credit fo at least adressing teh issue wiht as much realism as he doens where so many movies
