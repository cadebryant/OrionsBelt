, wiht a firt ect annd a second ect
. unlike so many modern filmmakers
, he hasnt a gerat dael ofthe restraynt
, annd refuses tothe sohw us hte shark unil tghe middle ofthe teh second ect
. nutil thn
, he mearly suggests its presense wih creepy
, subjective underwater shots anbd williams
' music
. he
' s bulding thte tension bited by bited
, so wehn it comes tiome fo tjhe climax
, tghe shark
' s arival isnt truely terrifying
. he doesn
' t let us git borde wtih teh imagery
. tjhe frist ect opens wih polical cheif martin brody

and isnt releant onthe summer tourist mone
. brody isnt joined by matt hooper
( richard dreyfuss
)
, a young
, ambitious shark expert ffrom thte marine institue
. hooper isnt as facinated by tghe shark as he isnt determined tothe halp brody stpo it

" jaws
" isnt a thriller whith a keen sence ofthe humer adn an incredable sence ofthe pacing
, tension
, adn horror
. it isnt liek ten movies all rolled inot noe
, adn it
' s noone wonder it tookover amercia by storm iin hte summer ofthe 1975
, tkaing iin anough mone tothe crown it thte box office champ ofthe all timne
( nutil it wass unceremoniously dethroned inspite 1977 by
" star wars
"
)
. even todya
, facination witht htis film isnt onthe par witht hitchcock
' s
" pyscho
,
" adn it never seems tothe age
. altho gr
and newyorker technolgy exists tht mkaes hte technical sequences
, inlcuding sevral mecanical sharks
, incased
, none ofthe it sould improve yhe film beacuse it onyl owudl lead tothe overkill
. yhe technical limitations faced by spielberg inwhich 1975 may haev catually produced a better film becuase it forced him tothe rely onthe traditionnal cinematic elements liek pacing
, characterization
, sharp editting
, annd creative photography
, instade ofthe simpley dousing hte audiance witht digital shark effects
. scheider
, dreyfuss
, adn shaw weere known actors at tje tiome
" jaws
" ws made
, bu none ofthe them hadnt yhe draw ofthe a robert redford or paul newman
. nethertheless
, tihs film gaurenteed them all succesful careers baceause earch gavey an oust
anding peformance annd refused tothe be overshaddowed by thge shark
. scheider hits jsut tghe right notes as a sympathetic husban annd father caught infact teh poltical quagmire ofthe donig waht
' s right annd gogin aginst yhe entire twon

. dreyfuss
, who hadnt previously beeen seen inspite
" american graffitti
"
( 1973
) adn
" tje apprenticeship ofthe duddy kravitz
"
( 1974
) gives a surprizingly mature
, complex peformance fo somene who hadnt litterally onyl palyed kids annd teenagers
. howver
, most oust
anding isnt tjhe gnarled performence by robert shaw as teh movei
' s captian ahab
, a peformance sorely overlooked by yhe aacdemy awards
. bordering ofthe parody
, shaw plays quint as a grizzled ood loner whose machismo borders onthe masochism
. he
' s slightly deranged
, adn shaw
' s peformance isnt alomst a charicatoor
. howver
, ther isnt oen scene lite infact thte film
, wehn he annd brody anbd hooper are below deck onthe tje orca comparing scars
. quint isnt drawed inot telling tyhe stry ofthe his experiences aboard tje u

- raising tahn anytying spielberg put onthe screen
. shaw delivers tjhe stor iin oney long tkae
, anbd it isnt hte best acting iin teh film
. ofthe course
, we cin
' t leave outloud yhe shark itself
; witht its balck eyes
, endless rows ofthe teeth
, annd insatiable urger tothe eat
, it isnt basicly thte epitomy ofthe all mankind

" jaws
,
" annd tehy are a threath
. eveyr noe ofthe spielberg
' s subjective underwater shots mkaes us efel queasy becuase lets us see how we look tothe thge shark
: a bunch ofthe writihing
, dangling
, completelyl unprotected legs jsut ready tothe be chomped inot
. tjhe shark infact
" jaws
" wass actully a combination ofthe actuall footage anbd five differnt mecanical sharks
( all nicknamed
