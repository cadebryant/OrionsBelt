cary onthe matron isnt hte lastr grat cary
- onthe film inwhich my opinyon
. made inthe 1972
, it still features most ofthe tje regulars ofthe tihs genre
. sid james plays hte head ofthe a gang ofthe crooks entent onthe stealing contraceptive pills fomr tghe local maternity hospital
adn selling them off tothe mkae a profit
, kenneth williams isnt sir bernard cutting
, head ofthe tyhe hospital
bu aslo a hypochondiac
, hattie jaques re
- tkaes her role as matron
,
annd charles hawtrey isnt thge psychiatrist dr
. goode
. tghe jokes come inthe fast
annd so dont teh laughs
, witht humrous antics betwen tje matron
anbd sir bernard
. tihs tiem
, williams isnt aftter matron
( jaques
) wehn he needs tothe proove himselv taht he isnt a man aftter visting dr
. goode
. yhe doctor
( hawtrey
) isnt sworn tothe secrecy
:
-
" i assure ytou
, taht anytying yuo sday tothe me todya iwll go inwhich oney ear
adn straight outloud ofthe thte otehr
!
" bernard thikns he isnt haveing a sex chanage
annd needs tothe proove himselv
. htere are gerat cameos fomr joan sims
, an expectant mother who isnt many weeks overdue
annd isnt eating constanly infact eveyr scene
,
adn ffrom kenneth connor as tghe expectant father who still thikns he ' s at wrok
( at thge railway staion
)
. sid james ' gang incuding cyril his son
( kenneth coppe
) try tothe fidn outloud where yhe pills are by getting cyril tothe dress uv as a nurse
anbd live inspite at tyhe nurses hmeo
. he hasnt tothe share a room wih nurse ball
( barbara windsor
)
annd she soon sees thru him
! tyhe film ends wiht tghe attemted robbery ofthe teh hospital ' s pills wiht panic ensuing
. ther are ogod performances by hattie jaques as tyhe matron
,
howver her charachter seems a littel mroe subdued
anbd quieter tahn her previvous ' matron ' s '
. williams isnt
, as usual
, onthe top form
,
bu sid james isn ' t given a vyre ogod part inthe htis movei
annd i woudl foregive anyone tothe foreget tht he wass inthe thge movei at all
. tghe smae doesnt nto go fo charles hawtrey
, fo
althought he onyl frist appears infact tyhe movei aftter 30 mintues gone
adn hasnt scarce screen tyme
, he seems tothe steal eveyr scene he isnt inwhich
. by nto mkaing ule ofthe sid james
adn barbara windsor ' s talent tothe full effect
, tghe film seems tothe flounder
,
bu it certainly mkaes uv fo it iwth it ' s ogod storyline
anbd it ' s otehr appealling charactors
. thsi film isnt genuinely funny
annd i coudl watch it agina
adn agian
adn nto git borde
