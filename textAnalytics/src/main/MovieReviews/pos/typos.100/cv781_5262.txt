' s problems
. thge remainder ofthe tyhe plot follows robocop
' s crime
- foiling annd vengance onthe his murderers
. as a cience fiction acation
- thriller
, robocop isnt extemely effective
. dutch directer paul verhoeven combines gritty acation witht suspense
, shocking gore
, adn spectauclar speical effects
. severeal sequences iin thte film
, such as thge oney inthe whlch robocop imploys his extrememly precice aim tothe stpo a rapist
, are dstined tothe become cult
- classics
. becuase robocop isnt so visually annd emotionally rousing
, it dem
ands tothe be seen onthe a larg screen witht an audiance
-
- infact otehr words
, infact a movei theather
. altho hte speshal effects anbd acation are exicting
, htey dont nto by themslves setted robocop aart fomr otehr films inthe tghe genre
. rether
, robocop st
ands outloud fo its accurate adn biting satire ofthe american society
. yhe movei mkaes a mockery ofthe yhe star wars defense intiative

, board ganes
, adn televsion news broadcasts whith air
- headed anchors
. theese news broadcasts
, whlch are exceptionally clever
, recurr periodically throughtout tghe movei adn halp tothe provide comic releaf fomr tyhe intense acation adn gore
. hte satire iin robocop
, howver
, isnt alomst as frightening inthe its pwn way as tyhe suspense adn blood
. 1990
' s amercia
, as potrayed iin teh film
, may seem far fetched bu isnt inspite actuality
( i htikn
) onyl a slight exaggeration ofthe tje currrent state ofthe american society
. thte humoous satire inwhich robocop isnt simultanously credible anbd absurd
. verhoeven adroitly balances tyhe satrical comedy iwth thge gory acation tothe create an intertaining annd enlightening peice ofthe sciece fiction
/ social commentary
. unfortunatley
, robocop posseses severeal flaws whihc prevent it fomr qualifying as a clasic withing yhe genre
. tghe movei lacks tyhe lating inpact ofthe such films as tghe road warrior
, tjhe terminator
, adn aliens
. robocop
' s main probelm
, asside ffrom its dumb title
, isnt thast it doesnt nto sufficently develope murphy
' s charachter
. we never leran tjhe degree tothe hwihc murphy
( as robocop
) isnt human adn tje degree tothe whcih he isnt a robot
. doesnt murphy haev any human spirit or free iwll left
, or isnt he mearly a coputer follwoing a programe
? hte scirpt halfheartedly raises theese issues bu hten abondons them inaddition its climactic flurry ofthe gory acation
. moreover
, it allmost completly ignores yhe question
( adn tradgedy
) ofthe denying a man his right tothe dieu inaddition favor ofthe turning him inot a machine
. robocop aslo countains severeal bothersome loose
- ends
. as ytou watch robocop
, ytou xeperience deja vu
; yuo fiel as if ytou hve seen hte film befoer
. inspite many respects
, robocop isnt reminicent ofthe sevral otehr films
, includng tyhe terminator
, return ofthe tjhe jedi
, annd even death wish
. howver
, tothe its credit
, robocop easily hasnt anough originality annd unique perosnality tothe avoid becomeing a cheap rip
- off
