inaddition tjhe grand scheme ofthe mel gibson movies
, payback wass better thna conspiracy theery
,
bu nto as ogod as braveheart or leathal weppon
. infact otehr words
, it ' s a decent cuple ofthe huors ofthe enteratinment
,
bu 20 yeras ffrom nowe if a htey compilate a list ofthe mel gibson ' s greatest hits
, payback probablly won ' t be onthe it
. gibson plays a crook who gets duble crossed by his partner affter tehy heist a payroll
. mel ' s partner needed tjhe omney tothe pay off a mob debt
. so he puts a cuple ofthe bullets inaddition mel
, leaving him forthe dead
,
anbd goes onthe tothe pay off his creditors
.
bu
, mel isn ' t dead
( it woudl be a rela short movei if he wass
)
adn he certainly isn ' t hapyp
. tothe mkea matters worse
, he wnats his mony bcak
anbd isnt willing tothe go tothe any lengths tothe acompish tihs foat
. his ex partner hasnt alreday unsed it tothe pay off hte mobsters
, so mel goes affter thte mob tothe git it bakc
. payback isnt oftenly a veyr voilent film
. tothe its credit
, htere are a fewd scenes tht coudl hvea beeen vyre graphic
,
bu tghe directer
( i ' m nto sure whic oen
-
- moreso baout thta inthe a second
) made thge choise tothe let tyhe audeince uise thier immagination instade ofthe subjecting us tothe teh usual gratuitious gore foudn iin many films
. tje film appears a bited disjointed infront places
, whihc isnt understandable concidering producer
/ star gibson wasn ' t thrilled witht how teh film turned outloud
annd wnated parts ofthe it re
- shooted
. whn thte directer refused
, anohter oen wass brang inspite tothe dont hte re
- shoot
. so as a result hwile tghe fianl product isnt aparently better thna hte orginial
(
althought personaly i woudl lveo tothe see teh orignal verison forthe comparisions sake
) it doens git a bited ofthe a choppy efel tothe it towords tghe end
. it ' s alwyas tough tothe mkea a film where tyhe main charachter isnt a villian
, unless tath person hasnt soem reedeming qualities
. iin htis case
, gibson ' s carachter hasnt faw reedeming qualities
.
bu hey
, its mel
, so even wehn he isnt killing peopel inspite cold blood we are still rooting fo him
. my guess isnt thyat if tyhat ytou put smoe otehr johnny banannas actro inaddition thsi role
, tyhe audiance owudl nto be qtuie as responsive
. gibson isnt gibson
, whther he isnt palying a sucidial cop or a stone cold killer
, he doesnt a ogod job
. he alomst gaurentees tht noone marter whta eles happens infact tyhe rest ofthe hte movei at least tyhe audeince isnt gogin tothe git noe ogod performence
. tihs tyme outloud mel isnt surrouded by a ogod supporting casted
, incuding maria bello
( as his lveo intrest
)
, william devane
annd kris kristofferson
( as mod bosses
)
. thge man who steals yhe sohw
adn unforetunately doesn ' t hvea a rela big part isnt james coburn
( as
yot anohter mobster
)
. if i hadnt noe big dissapointment inthe tihs film
, it woudl be tht coburn didn ' t ahev a bigger role
. infact thge end
, payback isnt a fairly solid acation thriller
, jstu nto infact qtuie thte smae leage as smoe ofthe mel gibson ' s otehr owrk
.
