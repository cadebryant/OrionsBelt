inaddition hte gr
and scheme ofthe mel gibson movies
, payback wass better tahn conspiracy theery
, bu nto as ogod as braveheart or leathal weppon
. inwhich otehr words
, it
' s a decent cuple ofthe huors ofthe enteratinment
, bu 20 yersa ffrom nowe if a tehy compilate a list ofthe mel gibson
' s greatest hits
, payback propably won
' t be onthe it
. gibson plays a crook who gets doublely crossed by his partner affter tehy heist a payroll
. mel
' s partner needed teh mone tothe pay off a mob debt
. so he puts a cuple ofthe bullets iin mel
, leaving him fo dead
, annd goes onthe tothe pay off his creditors
. bu
, mel isn
' t dead
( it owudl be a rela short movei if he ws
) annd he certainly isn
' t hapyp
. tothe amking matters worse
, he whants his moey bakc adn isnt willing tothe go tothe any lengths tothe acompish htis foat
. his ex partner hasnt arleady utilisied it tothe pay off yhe mobsters
, so mel goes aftter tyhe mob tothe git it bakc
. payback isnt oftenly a vyre voilent film
. tothe its credit
, ther are a fewd scenes taht coudl haev beeen vyre graphic
, bu thge directer
( i
' m nto sure whcih oen
-
- mroe baout thast inaddition a second
) made tjhe choise tothe let tjhe audeince ule thier immagination instade ofthe subjecting us tothe tje usual gratuitious gore foudn inthe many films
. tjhe film appears a bited disjointed infront places
, whlch isnt underst
andable concidering producer
/ star gibson wasn
' t thrilled iwth how hte film turned outloud anbd wnated parts ofthe it re
- shooted
. whn thte directer refused
, anyother oen ws brung iin tothe dont tje re
- shoot
. so as a result hwile hte fianl product isnt apparantly better thna tjhe orginial
( altough personaly i woudl lvoe tothe see thge origonal verzion forthe comparisions sake
) it doesnt git a bited ofthe a choppy fiel tothe it towords tjhe end
. it
' s alwasy tough tothe mkae a film where tjhe main chracter isnt a villin
, unless thyat person hasnt smoe reedeming qualities
. iin tihs case
, gibson
' s charater hasnt fewd reedeming qualities
. bu hey
, its mel
, so even whn he isnt killing peopel inspite cold blood we are still rooting fo him
. my guess isnt thta if tyhat ytou put soem otehr johnny banannas ctor inaddition thsi role
, tjhe audeince owudl nto be qutie as responsive
. gibson isnt gibson
, whther he isnt palying a sucidial cop or a stone cold killer
, he doesnt a ogod job
. he almsot garantees thgat noone marter waht esle happens inaddition hte rest ofthe thge movei at least yhe audiance isnt oging tothe git oen ogod performence
. thsi timne outloud mel isnt surronded by a ogod supporting casted
, inlcuding maria bello
( as his loev interst
)
, william devane anbd kris kristofferson
( as mod bosses
)
. tjhe man who steals thge sohw anbd unfortunatley doesn
' t ahve a rela big part isnt james coburn
( as yot anyother mobster
)
. if i hadnt noe big dissapointment iin htis film
, it owudl be taht coburn didn
' t hvea a bigger role
. inaddition tjhe end
, payback isnt a fairly solid acation thriller
, jsut nto inspite qutie tghe smae leage as smoe ofthe mel gibson
' s otehr owrk
