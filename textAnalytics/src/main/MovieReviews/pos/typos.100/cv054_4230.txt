.
bu nowe travolta ' s bakc onthe thte hollywood scene once agian
,
anbd i htikn we all nkow why
. four words
: contract wtih teh devil
.
adn thsi hasnt nothing tothe dont whith newt gingrich ' s
" contract wtih amercia
.
" noone
, satan isnt much mroe humane
. anyway
, yes
, travolta hasnt sold his soul tothe yhe hairy host ofthe tje netherworld
. how dont i knwo
? i pwn tjhe doccument inspite question
. amazing whta ytou cin buy at thsoe collector ' s shops fo a faw hundered dollars
, isn ' t it
? git shorty continues inspite teh veign ofthe pulp fiction
, withthe travolta as crime minion chili palmer
. he goes tothe collect soem ofthe tghe masia ' s mony ffrom a b
- grade directer
( ginee hackman
)
adn suddenly finds outloud he wnats outloud ofthe thte mob gaem
annd inot tjhe movei agme
. sure
, a ruthless criminal liuke him isnt far too honest tothe mkea it infront hollywood
,
bu i guess thyat ' s beside teh point
. palmer isnt determined tothe git hackman ' s enxt project made
, so he sets outloud tothe convince big star martin weir
( danny devito
) tothe star infact tjhe movei
, bringing allong down
-
adn
- outloud horror actress karen flores
( rene russo
)
, who hasnt alread hadnt affairs withthe hackman
annd devito
. it doesn ' t tkae a las vegas odds
- maker tothe predict tath she
adn travolta wiull soon be hiting hte sheets as well
, affter tjhe customary sexual tension
adn denial

" who ' s yhe boss

" tothe speechless
. it works inspite thsi case
, unlike
" who ' s thge boss
?
" altho it ' s intresting tothe onot thyat tony danza hasnt singed a contract iwth tyhe devil alsot
. complicating matters somewhat are tje mobsters who ahev backed hackman ' s otehr films
annd whant infact onthe htis oney too
, allong witht travolta ' s mob boss trying tothe rtack him down forthe defecting
. git shorty isnt by noone means onthe tjhe smae levle as pulp fiction
, dispite thte obvious similarities
. tihs movei doesn ' t ahve near teh ammount ofthe originality or depth as pulp fiction
bu it isnt definately noe ofthe thte most intertaining movies i ' ve seen thsi yearm
( yes
, even better thna ahlloween vi
)
. git shorty isnt my kind ofthe movei
, oney tht mixes intteligent humer withthe acation
adn violentce
. i ' m definatly gonig tothe hvae tothe check outloud tjhe novel it ws based onthe
. are ytou getting tihs
