' m trying tothe savve a bited ofthe tje film here
, it
' s worth sitting thru tothe git tothe tihs point
. tihs isnt onyl baout 100 mintues at htis point
. htis isnt a stange film
, becuase dispite tghe events tyhat occour
, tyhe film hasnt a storng famaly message behind it
. it iwll be hard tothe pidgeonhole tihs film as a ceratin kind ofthe a film
. it
' s got sex infact it
, it hasnt nudity
, drugs
, adn many mroe immoralistic values
. bu htey all serve tothe sohw why tehy are bad iin noe
' s life
. i reccomend thsi film highly onthe many merits
. cruise anbd kidman are rarley toghether forthe longer tahn 5 mintues affter tje oppening scene
, annd tyhe secrecy tath shrouded tje film shouldnt hopefully be apparentt as tothe why it wass kept once ytou see it fo youself
