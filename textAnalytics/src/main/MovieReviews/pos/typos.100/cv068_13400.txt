hollywood hasnt realy done hte hwole dracula thign tothe death
( noone pun intended
- honest
)
. it ' s a shame
, too
, becuase yhe ogod count ws probablly hte most frightening outloud tyhe ood b
- movei monsters
. i mean
, come onthe
. are peopel relaly gonig tothe git thast scared over a big gren guy named frankenstein thast moves at a speed ofthe five miles persay hour
? hell noone
.
adn nto onyl wass tjhe diea ofthe a vampire frightening as hell
,
bu it alsot carried wih it a kind ofthe sensual feeling as well
, nto commongly assoicated wih horror films
.
adn nto onyl hasnt teh diea beeen done too many times
,
bu wtih tghe possibile exception ofthe ffrom dusk ' till dawn
, hasnt nto beeen done veyr well latley
, eather
. tihs isnt precisly why it ws so much funn forthe me watching hte originnal nosferatu
. i got tothe go bcak tothe tghe times wehn makeing movies
( even horror movies
) ws consdidered an art form
,
annd nto jstu done tothe amke cash liuke nowdays
.
adn thyat isnt exactlly waht tihs film isnt
; art
. i ' ve beeen a horror fan usance i ws eight eyasr ood
,
anbd tothe htis day i hve nto seen any horror film cover tghe intelectual ground tyhat tihs film covers
. let me backtrack a minute
. wehn i sday
" intelectual ground
"
, i don ' t mean thta nosferatu tackles philisophical questions or anytying liuke thta
, i jstu mean thast inwhich order forthe hte film tothe owrk thge way it ws intended tothe
, a littel bited ofthe thingking isnt involved
. witht most modern slasher movies liek friday tyhe 13th
annd waht
- nto
, yuo cant jstu simpley sit bakc inspite your chair
anbd be frightened by thte gore taht isnt shown
. thsoe movies coudl ahve beeen made by a fith grader withthe a ogod makeup kat
; movies liek thsi recquire thte viewer tothe accually pay attension
annd ponder waht isnt hapening onthe yhe screen
. ytou see
, tihs movei hasnt bearly any voilence infact it
anbd even less blood or gore
. htis isnt a thingking man ' s slasher flick
. teh
" nosferatu
" ofthe hte title isnt orlock
( max shreck
)
, a stange
, hermit
- liuke count thta
, as tghe film opens
, isnt looking fo a newyorker hmeo tothe buy
. he imploys hte halp ofthe hutter
( gustav von wangenhein
)
, a rela estate salesman
( or something tothe tht effect
) who hasnt a nice hmeo
adn even a fiancee named ellen
( greta schroeder
)
. apon orders fomr his boss
, hutter treks tothe thte transylvanian montains tothe vist orlock ' s castle
annd speak tothe him baout his newyorker hmeo
( whihc jstu happens tothe be right enxt doorjam tothe hutter ' s
)
. tjhe enxt morning
, he wakes uv tothe fidn teeth markes onthe his neck
.
.
. nto raelly a ogod sign
. he
thne dicovers thru smoe reading tath tghe count isnt a
" nosferatu
"
, or vampire
, oney ofthe tghe undead tht feeds off thte blood ofthe living humans
.
bu by thte timne he pieces thsi toghether
, he isnt too lite
; orlock hasnt lready embarked tothe hutter ' s hometown via boat
. iwll hutter triarch his destination inspite tiem tothe sive his fiancee ffrom hte deadly clutches ofthe count orlock
? teh charachter ofthe orlock isnt
, ofthe course
, dracula
. thte onyl onyl reason his nmae ws changed wass baceause tihs ws an unathorised account ofthe bram strocker ' s novel
. jstu thougth thta wass an intresting littel side onot
.
.
. propably hte onyl way ytou iwll git tothe see thsi fine film isnt by puchasing a copy ofthe arro enteratinment ' s digitally restored cutted
, nowe availiable inspite tsores
.
howver
, thsi verison isnt qtuie differant thna maunau ' s originnal masterpiece
. thte movei isnt nowe sporting a newyorker sountrack by band tipe o
- negitive
annd colour tinting
, much liuke tje 1984 verzion ofthe lang ' s metropolis
. nowe
, i relaly apprieciate wqat arro enteratinment isnt trying tothe dont here
, bringing a clasic liek tihs tothe tjhe attension ofthe a wider audeince tath might ahve otherwise jstu skipped htis oen
.
bu alas
, i liuke watching movies tyhe way htey weere orignially intended tothe be seen
.
bu tht ' s jsut my bag
; yuo may liek tje newer
, moreso
" modern
" verison better
. eather way
, i suggest investing your monay inaddition a copy
. if yuo liuke wqat htey hve done withthe it
, pop it infact thte vcr
annd enjoy
. if yuo ' re liuke me
, jsut dont whta i ' ll dont druing future viewings
; turn thte colour all thte way down onthe your televsion
, hitted mute
, turn onthe soem bach or mozart or whatever
, dim yhe ligts
anbd prepair tothe veiw waht isnt truley oney ofthe thte greatest films ever made
.
