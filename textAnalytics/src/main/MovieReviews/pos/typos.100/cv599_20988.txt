. bu thsi isnt smith
' s perosnality
, annd his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how doesnt oney interpet yhe bible
( or koran
, etc
.
) correctly
( or if htere even isnt a correctly
) anbd how noe settles disputes ofthe heretofore dogmatic concerns
. hte stry concerns abortion clinic worker bethany

- scenes manipulator forthe all tje chicanery
. hte logical bu convoluted plot onyl exists as an excuse forthe tyhe jokes anbd tothe mkae smith
' s points
, annd inspite itself
, hasnt littel dramtic momentum
. amoung hte suposedly outrageous claimes made by tyhe film isnt thgat god isnt a woman
, jesus ws balck
, annd yhe bible wass wroten by a bunch ofthe racist
, misogynistic white men
. ofthe course
, kevin smith doesnt nto necesarily subscribe tothe theese idesa hismelf

' s jokes jsut bomb
, as inaddition virtualy anytying involving salma hayek

, smith keesh thte zingers comming at a suffciently repid pace
. amonth hte actors
, fiorentino anbd rickman st
and outloud by far
. fiorentino virutally by herself gives thge film emotional weight
. damon anbd affleck are fairly lacklustre
. rock annd hayek exsist infact teh film preety much onyl as comic releaf as are mews annd smith
