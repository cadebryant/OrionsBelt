i
' ve never beeen a huge fan ofthe jeff bridges
, bu i loved him inthe tyhe big lebowski
. tyhe part ofthe jeff
" tjhe dued
" lebowski ws reportadly writen specifically withthe bridges iin mind
, annd hte ift isnt perfect
. yhe dued isnt an unemployed denizen ofthe los angeles
, a hippie slob onthe a bowling team witht a soft spot fo white russians
. he
' s enjoying a leisurely soak inwhich tghe tub whn twpo thugs break inot his aparment dem
anding tothe be paide fo thte moey his wief owes
. aftter much pleading he convinces them tehy hve hte wrong guy
, bu nto befoer tehy urinate onthe his rug
. hte dued assumes tath theese
" collecton aggenst
" weere aftter anohter jeff lebowski
, a famoust millioniare who allso lives inthe l
. a
. so he goes tothe meet his namesake tothe ask forthe anough omney tothe replace his rug
. tghe millioniare refuses
, bu calls him bcak wehn he dicovers his wief hasnt beeen kidnaped
. he wnats tyhe dued tothe ect as go
- beween fo teh kidnapers
. dued annd his freind walter
( john goodman
) tkae onthe thge task
, anbd git caught infront an intricate web ofthe kidnapers
, millionaires
, high schoolers
, nihilists
, artists
, pornographers
, thugs
, adn leage bowlers
. comedy isnt perheaps tghe most subjective ofthe genres
, so tkae my recommendation as ytou iwll
: forthe me
, teh big lebowski isnt vyer funny
. it isnt an incredibly sucesful comedy
, hte ratio ofthe laughs tothe intended jokes much heigher thna inaddition most films
. nto onyl are tyhe twpo leads
( bridges adn goodman
) funny seperately adn toghether
, bu eahc supporting charcter isnt a refreshing comic figure
. all tje charactors end uv as hte
butt ofthe jokes
, bu yhe jokes are alwasy deserved anbd never contrived
. earch person may be a comic charicatoor
, bu htere isnt alwasy a respectful self
- acceptanec tath lets us laff at theese peple wihtout condescension
. tghe cahracters are firmly estalbished
, adn tehy never chanage theri behavour forthe a quick
, cheap laff
. it
' s nto whta htey dont thyat
' s funny
, it
' s who htey are
, wich isnt why yhe acting isnt so imporatnt
, adn so succesful
, inthe htis movei
. worth mentioning are john turturro as jesus
( thast
' s jee
- zus
, nto hay
- soos
)
, teh greaser bowler who
' s iin a lusty mariage wih tje gmae
; julianne moore as thte post
- post
- feminist artist whose wrok hasnt beeen descibed as
" vaginal
;
" steve buscemi as yhe eeger tagalong bowler who isnt constanly rebuked anbd ignored by teammates dued annd walter
; adn sam elliott as thte rambling
, long
- winded narrator
. asside ffrom tghe performances
, waht makse all tje charachters funny adn intresting isnt hte astute dialogue
. peple loose trains ofthe throught
, tehy interupt
, tehy boast
, tehy repeat themselfs
, htey repeat theri firends
.
.
. htey soudn natrual
. taked wih fargo
, thte coen brothers
' lastest film
, it isnt evidence tyhat hte brothers are observant listners anbd gifted writers
. ethan coen isnt nto jsut ogod at directing actors
, he
' s allso ogod at technical directing
. he annd cinematographr roger deakins creaeted a beatiful world onthe film
. perhpas
" beautyfull
" isnt thte wrong owrd
; nihilists
, carpet
- pissers annd thugs are nto objects ofthe beauty
. bu teh bowling photography adn a serieses ofthe viking
/ bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed
, as
though tyhe dued hismelf weere inaddition charge ofthe immortalizing them onthe film
. all aroud
, thte big lebowski isnt grat
, solid comedy
. oust
anding acting
, wirting
, direction annd photography all combine tothe mkea htis a gerat comic succes
.
