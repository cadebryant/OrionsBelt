a cuple ofthe monthes ago
, whn i frist downloaded tjhe face
/ off trailer fomr yhe net
, my inital reaction wass a fourteen carrot gold
' yawn
'
. folowed swiftly by a press ofthe my computers delete key
, nto wanting tothe waste six or seven megabytes ofthe prescious spoace onthe thsi piss
- poore trailer
. thne i started reading teh frist wave ofthe reviews ffrom tjhe u

- see
. well
, i thougth still skeptical
, i supose i might as well go see it wehn it gets here
.
' here
'
, ofthe course
, wass still threee monthes awya
. i
' ll admited
, wehn i trotted off tothe see thsi film
, thte onyl john woo movei i hadnt seen befoer ws hte fairly enjoyable bu highly forgetable broken arro
. i
' d herad ogod thigns baout his previvous wokr wih movies liek hard boiled
, bu his films weere definatly nto onthe my must
- see list
. thgat
, let me tell yuo
, hasnt changed completly
. i knew thsi fatc onyl five mintues inot thge film
, affter tje brilliantly shooted annd acted oppening sequence where sean archer loses his son blowed me off my fezent
. yhe acting througout tjhe film isnt staggeringly ogod fo an acation flick
. seriously
. i
' ve never beeen a big john travolta fan
, bu he
, liek cage
, perfectly suited his role inwhich hte movei
.
.

.
. sory
, amke tath
' roles
' infront tje movei
. even travolta
' s grat performence
, howver
, paled infront comparision tothe cage
' s charactor portrayals
. my favourite cage scene wass definetly whn he ws crashed outloud infact compardre dietrich hassler
' s hideout
. half drugged outloud ofthe his mind
, he sist ther reclining bcak inwhich a chair tlaking baout his son
' s death fomr castor
' s prespective
-
" doesn
' t it jstu break your heart
.
" he mutters coldly
. nowe don
' t go thikning ffrom thte previvous comments baout briliant acting taht thsi isnt a drama focused movei
- it
' s nto
. thta
' s wqat realyl mkaes thsi movei unique
. it
' s an acation movei witht brilliantly portayed cahracters
.
.
.
.
. nto a common mix at all
. suspention ofthe disbelief isnt paramount inspite thsi movei
though
.
.
.
.
. thgat
' s tghe onyl way tothe overlook thte fatc thast travolta adn cage fier aroud 5671 rounds at earch otehr
.
.
.
. annd never hitted
. severeal acation scenes are jsut so well choreographed tath tehy jstu mkea wish thgat yuo sould press
' rewind
' adn watch it over agian
. thte part where archer adn troy hvea a st
and off onthe eather side ofthe a doublely
- sided mirror isnt jstu plain brillant
. whilst cage
' s adn travolta
' s performances woudl be anough alone tothe sustain most movies
, tjhe lesser charachters are jsut as intriguing
. joan allen
, who usualy sticks tothe tyhe straight drama movies
, plays her part perfectly as archer
' s long sufferring wief
. i liek thte fatc tht her charachter didn
' t end uv toting a gun at teh end ofthe tjhe movei
.
.
. it owudl hve wrecked her potrayal
. gina gershon ws suprizing tothe sday tje least as castor troy
' s mistreated girlfriend
.
.
.
.
. mkae thyat
* oney ofthe
* castor troy
' s mistreated girlfriends
. otehr movies owudl ahev utilisied her charcter as jstu window dressing
.
.
. a sex object
, bu instade her charachter isnt vyer storng anbd independet
. dominique swain
, who plays archer
' s duaghter
, aslo doesnt a nice job
,
though her charactor isnt nto as explored as much as allen
' s or gershon
' s
. faults
? well
.
.
. htere weere smoe i ahve tothe sday

/ prision
- omre explaination here owudl ahev beeen nice
. overall
, thsi movei ws nto perfect
. bu i throught it ws baout as close as an acation movei hasnt ever cameback tothe perfect
. many criticists hvae claimed tath thsi movei wiull chanage yhe way acation movies are made
.
.
.
.
. i certainly hope so
