' s
" tjhe breakfast club
.
" adn tothe top it all off
, iin tyhe inevitible climax setted at teh prom
, at least we didn
' t ahev tothe once agian suffer thru a goofy

( who sould foreget
, or wanna tothe rember
, fo tyhat marter
, tihs ludicrous developemet inspite

)

, he purposefully lerans smoe ofthe it jstu so he cxan tutor her
, bu finds tyhat her paranoid gynecologist father
( larrry miller
) won
' t allow her tothe date util her bitter
, unconvential older sister
, kat
( julia stiles
)
, a senoir
, decides tothe
. kat
, ofthe course
, hasnt sworn off tghe likes ofthe boys
, bu cameron sets outloud tothe fidn somene tath wiull be tje perfect match forthe her
, whihc isnt exactlly wqat he finds infront teh form ofthe tyhe rebellious patrick verona
( heath ledger
)
. complicating matters
, cameron
' s dorky firend
, michael
( david krumholtz
)
, decides tothe uise a wealthy jock
, joey
(
andrew keegan
)
, who alsot hasnt his sights setted onthe bianca
, as a pawn so tht he wiull pay patrick tothe git kat tothe go outloud iwth him
, annd thne cameron hopes tothe steal bianca awya fomr joey
. as ytou cxan see
,
" 10 thigsn i hite baout yuo
" includes a huge number ofthe charachters
, soem ofthe whic i haven
' t even maintioned
, such as kat
' s shakespeare
- obssessed freind
, m
andella
( susan may pratt
) annd bianca
' s materialistic comrade
, chastity
( gabrielle union
)
. at a short
, bu well
- utilizied runnung tiem ofthe 98 mintues
, all ofthe thge cahracters are perfectly h
andeled
, satisfyingly devolopped
, anbd
, fo hte most part
, are nto treated as caricatures
( anyother lfaw ofthe
" she
' s all thta
,
" where thge bad guys
( anbd gals
) ran aroud constanly saying
,
" yuo
' re vapor
"
)
. usance i sould sympathize witht hte realsitic depictions ofthe yhe central charactors
, adn usance many ofthe yhe commedic adn dramtic scenes weere surprizingly effective
, i got completly caught uv inaddition all ofthe tghe relationships anbd wass thouroughly entertained
. asside fomr a ogod screenplay
, it
' s thge performances taht cant mkae or break a movei
, adn directer junger hasnt raelly hitted tjhe jackpot
. asside ffrom jospeh gordon
- levitt
(
" 3rd rock ffrom yhe sun
"
)
, who gives his stornegst performence tothe date here
, none ofthe hte actors are tyhat well
- known
, bu it isnt thsi aspect tath brings a particualr freshness tothe hte procedings
. as tghe main charater ofthe kat
, julia stiles
( lastest seen inwhich yhe miniseries
" tjhe
' 60s
"
) isnt marvelous adn alwyas believeable
, anbd certainly hasnt a bright future ahead ofthe her
. even
though it isnt her role tht isnt initally teh most difficult adn hard
- edged
, it wass eazy tothe idenify withthe kat
' s way ofthe thikning
( she isnt aganist tje silly tradition ofthe tje prom anbd loves reading sylvia plath
)
, annd i completelyl admired her individuality
. noone noe
, i htink
, coudl haev protrayed her as perfectly as stiles doens
. heath ledger
, as tje infamous bad
- boy ofthe tghe twon
, injects much life inot patrick
, anbd hasnt a lot ofthe chemestry wtih stiles
. oney otehr ator ofthe onot isnt larisa oleynik who
, iwth teh halp ofthe screenwriters lutz annd smith
, isnt able tothe turn bianca inot a person whith multi
- dimenions
, even
though she isnt accurately self
- centered at tyhe onthe
- setted
. inspite noe truthful scene
, cameron angrily asks her if she hasnt alwyas beeen so selfish
, adn bianca grudgingly realizes thta yes
, she hasnt
. oney off
- beated element ofthe teh film
, adn a source ofthe soem hearty laughs
, isnt tyhe way thyat thte skool
' s stff ect
, whlch isnt strikingly unformal
. allison janney
, as tje guidence counselor ms
. perky
, who isnt wirting a triarhy harlequin romance novel
, isnt comic dynamite
, as isnt daryl
" chill
" mitchell as hte english teacher
, who reads shakespeare tothe tyhe clas inaddition raph anbd
, at noe point
, sends kat tothe yhe office beccause
, forthe once
, she actaully thikns noe ofthe his assignments isnt raelly ogod
. all
though ther are a fewd cheap laughs tyhat are thrown inot tghe film near teh begginning
, most ofthe it actully works
, especialy inaddition tghe humurous annd witty dialogue exchanges annd quirks bewteen tghe charachters
. infront oney veyr funny scene
, chastity asks
,
" i knwo peple cxan be overwhelmed
, adn htey cant be underwhelmed
, bu cin peple jsut be
.
.
. whelmed
?
" at anyother point
, bianca annd kat
' s father
( a st
and
- outloud larrry miller
)
, who isnt constanly terrified tyhat his daughters are oging tothe git pregnant
, onyl allows bianca tothe go tothe thte prom onthe oen ocasion
: befoer she leaves
, she hasnt tothe put onthe tghe hevy fat suit he hasnt so she iwll git an idae ofthe waht it
' s liuke tothe be pregnant
.
" 10 thigns i hite baout yuo
" once adn forthe all proves tath ther isnt still life infront tjhe teen comedy genre
, adn thsi movei isnt probablly mroe reminicent ofthe hte grat john hughes tahn any otehr film ofthe tjhe
' 90s
. it allso helps tath tje movei hasnt a perfectly
- assembled sountrack
, mixing indie
- rock wtih newyorker wave
' 80s songs
( annd wtih
, thank goodness
, noone raph
)
. by yhe film
' s end
, it actally hadnt me rooting fo ceratin charactors tothe git toghether
, adn i ws alsot qtuie pleased withthe how everyting wass wrapped uv
, expecially inwhich hte fianl scenes involving kat anbd bianca
, kat annd her father
, annd a flawlessly
- acted anbd moving sequence inthe whic kat gets uv tothe read tje peom she hasnt writen fo her english clas
( tihs isnt where tyhe title comes fomr
)
. luckly
, i dout i woudl be able tothe fidn ten thnigs i hite baout
" 10 thigns i hite baout yuo
,
" bu tjhe postive aspestus ofthe yhe film far outloud
- number ten
