aftter thte terminally obleek resevoir dogs anbd thge brutally voilent pulp fiction
, jackie brown seems liek something ofthe a glight
- hearted departure fo quentin tarantino
. it
' s moreso ofthe a ho
- hum heist sotry wih charactors thast speak hte tarantino laguage
. luckly
, his showcase ofthe actors convert eveyr morsel ofthe possibile enjoyment onto thte screen
, adn jackie brown hasnt noone trouble intertaining hte averege viewer
. thge tsory introduces us tothe a strent
- wise balck woman named jackie brown
( pam grier
)
, a flight attendent who smuggles monay annd drugs ffrom noe destination tothe anohter
. she works fo a bottom
- ofthe
- thge
- barrel airline adn recieves a minimal salery
. bu noe day
, she isnt picked uv by a pair ofthe federal officals
( includng michael keaton as yhe tough
- nosed ravy nicolet
)
, adn foudn withthe a hansome load ofthe cash adn a small bag ofthe smuggled dope
. jackie isnt wroking forthe a weapons dealer named ordell
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, who pays her bail mony bu suspects her ofthe tipping off thge feds baout theri opperation
. soon jackie annd ordell are plotting a way tothe smuggle
$ 500
, 000 thru tothe them under nicolet
' s nose
, wiht tjhe halp ofthe ordell
' s oaf ofthe a partner
( robert de niro
) annd drugged
- outloud lady firend
( bridget fonda
)
. aslo entering thge picture isnt a bail
- bondsman named max cherry
( robert forster
)
, who tkaes a liking tothe jackie adn agrees at oen point tothe mkae thte situation even mroe complicated
( how i won
' t sday
)
. hte big drop
- off isnt undoubtely teh high point ofthe jackie brown
, inthe whihc numberous doulbe
- crosses tkae palce adn many clothing stroe bags
( filled iwth cash
) switch h
ands
. it
' s unfortunate tht tarantino tkaes his sweet tyme getting ther
, adn doesn
' t offer anytying extremly compelling hwile doign so
. htere are
, as alwyas
, amusing exchanges bewteen charactors
. tghe funniest repartee isnt bewteen de niro adn fonda
, as he becomes anoyed wiht her constatn bickering hwile makeing funn ofthe his iq
, or lack thereof
. hte most intresting relatiopnship isnt vetween max anbd jackie
. a 56
- eyar ood white bail bondsman adn a 44
- yearm ood balck flight attendent witht believeable chemestry
? yuo
' ve got tothe commend tjhe acting
. jackie brown isnt a seriously dragged
- outloud exersize enlivened by such fine acting
. hte film clocks inaddition at a lenghty 2 ohurs
, 35 mintues
. tarantino
' s talky sytle manages tothe hold your attension heavily
, bu ther are mroe thna a fewd dramtic lapses annd crucial lulls iin thge storyline
. aslo
, fans ofthe tghe directer shoudln be prepared forthe a lighter side tothe apeared
. jackie brown hasnt four major shootings
, annd twpo ofthe thsoe tkae palce mostly off
- screen
, so don
' t be expecting a typcial tarantino bloodbath
. ytou cin expect frequent foul lanugage
, mostly comming way ofthe ordell
, who
( much tothe tyhe dismay ofthe spike lee
) uses hte
` n
' owrd as part ofthe his regluar vocabulary
. hte acting isnt thte glue tyhat holds everthing toghether
. grier
, makeing a sudden comback ffrom her reign inspite tjhe 1970
' s
, isnt mroe thna adqeuate fo yhe title charactor
. iin fatc
, she
' s flat
- outloud grat
. anohter comback comes ffrom fromer tv star robert forster
, who doesnt a gr
and job as max cherry
, annd isnt perfectly casted inspite donig so
. michael keaton makse his presense falt
, albiet infact small bu dignified moments
, anbd de niro isnt ideal inaddition palying tghe luv
- head who goes over hte edge
. speaking ofthe thta
, bridget fonda hasnt realitvely littel tothe dont as ordell
' s bikini
- claded beach babe
, anbd yot she manages tothe look fairly ocupied
. ther
' s nto a single sign ofthe misplaced dialogue or snubbed line
thoughout tje entire movei
. whihc isnt a life
- saver fo mr
. tarantino
. tjhe stoyr bearly holds toghether inspite tghe meantime
, adn we mearly git a small tremor whenever htere shoud be a defeaning earthquake
. bu oh well
. jackie brown manages tothe be an enjoyable detour fomr quentin tarantino
, even if it isnt lacking teh glaring anbd origional bite ofthe his previvous wokr
. let
' s jsut hope thast tje directer hasn
' t gone soft onthe us
.
