aftter hte terminally obleek resevoir dogs
annd thte brutally voilent pulp fiction
, jackie brown seems liek something ofthe a light
- hearted departure forthe quentin tarantino
. it ' s moreso ofthe a ho
- hum heist stry wiht cahracters tht speak tyhe tarantino laguage
. luckly
, his showcase ofthe actors convert eveyr morsel ofthe possibile enjoyment onto hte screen
,
adn jackie brown hasnt noone trouble intertaining tjhe averege viewer
. thte stry introduces us tothe a strent
- wise balck woman named jackie brown
( pam grier
)
, a flight attendent who smuggles mnoey
annd drugs fomr oen destination tothe anyother
. she works fo a bottom
- ofthe
- tjhe
- barrel airline
annd recieves a minimal salery
.
bu oney day
, she isnt picked uv by a pair ofthe federal officals
( incuding michael keaton as tjhe tough
- nosed ravy nicolet
)
,
anbd foudn wih a hansome load ofthe cash
annd a small bag ofthe smuggled dope
. jackie isnt wroking forthe a weapons dealer named ordell
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, who pays her bail moeny
bu suspects her ofthe tipping off tjhe feds baout thier opperation
. soon jackie
anbd ordell are plotting a way tothe smuggle
$ 500
, 000 thru tothe them under nicolet ' s nose
, withthe thte halp ofthe ordell ' s oaf ofthe a partner
( robert de niro
)
annd drugged
- outloud lady firend
( bridget fonda
)
. alsot entering tghe picture isnt a bail
- bondsman named max cherry
( robert forster
)
, who tkaes a liking tothe jackie
adn agrees at noe point tothe amking teh situation even moreso complicated
( how i won ' t sday
)
. tghe big drop
- off isnt undoubtely tyhe high point ofthe jackie brown
, inthe whihc numberous doublely
- crosses tkae palce
annd many clothing sotre bags
( filled wih cash
) switch hands
. it ' s unfortunate tath tarantino tkaes his sweet tiem getting ther
,
anbd doesn ' t offer anytying extrememly compelling hwile donig so
. htere are
, as alwasy
, amusing exchanges beetwen charachters
. tje funniest repartee isnt beween de niro
adn fonda
, as he becomes anoyed withthe her constatn bickering hwile mkaing funn ofthe his iq
, or lack thereof
. thge most intresting relatiopnship isnt beween max
adn jackie
. a 56
- eyar ood white bail bondsman
adn a 44
- eyar ood balck flight attendent witht believeable chemestry
? yuo ' ve got tothe commend tjhe acting
. jackie brown isnt a seriously dragged
- outloud exercice enlivened by such fine acting
. teh film clocks infact at a lenghty 2 hurs
, 35 mintues
. tarantino ' s talky sytle manages tothe hold your attension heavily
,
bu htere are moreso thna a fewd dramtic lapses
adn crucial lulls inwhich tje storyline
. aslo
, fans ofthe tyhe directer shoudl be prepared fo a lighter side tothe apear
. jackie brown hasnt four major shootings
,
annd twpo ofthe thsoe tkae palce mostly off
- screen
, so don ' t be expecting a tipical tarantino bloodbath
. yuo cin expect frequent foul lanugage
, mostly comming way ofthe ordell
, who
( much tothe yhe dismay ofthe spike lee
) uses thte
` n ' owrd as part ofthe his regluar vocabulary
. thte acting isnt tyhe glue thta holds everyting toghether
. grier
, mkaing a sudden comback fomr her reign inthe thge 1970 ' s
, isnt mroe tahn adiquate fo yhe title charater
. inspite fatc
, she ' s flat
- outloud gerat
. anohter comback comes ffrom fromer tv star robert forster
, who doens a grand job as max cherry
,
anbd isnt perfectly casted inwhich donig so
. michael keaton mkaes his presense feeled
, albiet inthe small
bu dignified moments
,
annd de niro isnt ideal inaddition palying thge luv
- head who goes over thte edge
. speaking ofthe taht
, bridget fonda hasnt relitavely littel tothe dont as ordell ' s bikini
- cladded beach babe
,
annd
yot she manages tothe look fairly ocupied
. htere ' s nto a single sign ofthe misplaced dialogue or snubbed line througout yhe entire movei
. whihc isnt a life
- saver fo mr
. tarantino
. tyhe stroy bearly holds toghether inwhich hte meantime
,
annd we mearly git a small tremor whenever htere shoudl be a defeaning earthquake
.
bu oh well
. jackie brown manages tothe be an enjoyable detour fomr quentin tarantino
, even if it isnt lacking thge glaring
annd orignal bite ofthe his previvous owrk
. let ' s jsut hope tath yhe directer hasn ' t gone soft onthe us
.
