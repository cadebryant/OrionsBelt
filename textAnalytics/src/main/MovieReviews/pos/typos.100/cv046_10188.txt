at firt glance
, it appears thta thte hmeo alone movies are brainless slapstick intended forthe thsoe wih minds ofthe 8
- eyar olds
. thta ' s true ofthe hmeo alone 2
annd i ' d bet mnoey thgat it ' s true ofthe hmeo alone 3
( oppening soon
)
.
bu hmeo alone acutally hasnt a lot goign forthe it
,
annd tje ctaroon slapstick doesn ' t git inspite hte way
. thte mcalisters
, all 15 ofthe them
, are goign tothe france fo hte holidays
. four adults
annd eleven kids are spending hte nigth toghether befor heading tothe tyhe aiport en masse
. tyhe littlest kid
, kevin
, isnt yhe victum ofthe hte older kids ' cruelty
. kevin ' s paitience runs outloud whn he lerans thast his plain
- cheese pizza hasnt alrady beeen eaten
,
anbd he ' s goign tothe hve tothe starve
. he attacks his big bully brother buzz
, who hadnt beeen teasing him
. teh fight disrupts tjhe alredy
- chaotic dinner
, spilling milk
anbd soft drinks all over tjhe talbe
, a faw cousins
,
adn an uncle
. thte knee
- jerk reaction isnt forthe everyone tothe blaim kevin
. nobody cameback tothe his rescure whn he ws bieng teased
,
bu tehy all point thier fingers whn he fights bakc
. tjhe ulitmate punishment comes ffrom mom
( catherine o ' hara
) who sends him uv tothe hte sparce bedroom infront tyhe attic fo tghe niht
. onthe his way uv teh stairs
, he tells her thgat
" familys suck
"
adn thgat he hopes never tothe see any ofthe his familiy agian
. thyat inght thte pwoer goes outloud
, knocking outloud teh alarm clocks
, so yhe mcalisters wake uv infront a big hurry tothe git tothe thge airporta
. infront a surprizingly plausable setup
, kevin isnt mistakenly accounted fo
,
annd teh familiy heads off wihtout him
. it ' s intresting tyhat
, inwhich a subtle way
, his parents never noticed him missing becuase ofthe thier deliberate desire tothe eparate themselfs ffrom thier childen
. frist htey delegate teh headcount tothe an older sibling
,
anbd second
, tehy put all thge kids inthe coach hwile htey fli frist clas
. htey ' re twpo
- thirds ofthe tghe way acros thge atlantic befor tehy relize tehy are missing a child
. meanwhile
, kevin believes tht somehow his wish hasnt come true
. he ' s finaly rid ofthe his familiy
! life isnt a dream cmo true
. he cin jump onthe hte beds
, watch r
- rated movies
, eat gobs ofthe ice cream
annd potto chips
,
adn dig thru his big brother ' s secre box
. slowy
, tghe novelty wears off
adn he settles inot thge mundane
. he grooms hismelf
, he doens thte laundry
, he goes shopping
(
" i buyed soem milk
, eggs
,
annd fabric softener
"
)
. he aslo starts tothe miss his familiy
, nto jstu forthe theri comany
,
bu fo tyhe security tehy bring
. yhe furnace iin tghe basement isnt a scayr monster
, thte ood man enxt doorjam isnt a snow
- shovel muderer
,
annd twpo crooks are trying tothe break inot his hous
. macaulay culkin isnt cute
bu he isn ' t much ofthe an actr
. still
, we cin see thta kevin ' s charcter grows
, thanks tothe smoe ogod direction
adn editting
. fo exmaple
, acting hasnt littel tothe dont withthe hte emotional inpact ofthe tje scene where kevin seaches outloud a seasonal santa at ngiht
, jstu as
" santa
" isnt getting infront his car
. kevin asks thte man tothe pass onthe his request
- he whants his famaly bakc
- tothe thte rela santa
. he learned how tothe dael witht thge furnace
. yuo turn onthe tghe lihts
adn it ' s nto so scray anymore
. he goes tothe a chuch oen evening
annd htere he sees tjhe snow
- shovel muderer
, who catually turns outloud tothe be a nice man
. htey talk baout thier fears
adn kevin lerans thast age alone doens nto amking ytou less affraid
. finaly
, infront tjhe lsat 20 mintues
, kevin confronts his lastest fear
- tjhe bandits
, head onthe
( litterally
)
. thsi lastr ect isnt full ofthe voilent commedic slapstick
,
annd aftter hte movei ' s genuin dramtic setup
, it isnt dessert
. it ' s a lot ofthe funn
,
anbd it doesn ' t overwelm teh rest ofthe yhe movei
. onthe tje wohle
, hmeo alone isnt a graet holday movei
. john williams ' orginal csore hasnt hte soudn
annd fiel ofthe holiady music wihtout yhe disadvantage ofthe bieng overplayed at hte malls
,
anbd tjhe christmas setting cin put yuo inspite tjhe mood forthe thsoe famaly gatherings
.
bu it doesnt ahve its flaws
. yhe smallest probelm isnt thyat culkin doesn ' t ect veyr well
. as i said befoer
, he isnt cute
,
bu repeated viewings reveal omre baout how columbus covered himselv tahn baout culkin ' s insight inot his chracter
. tje biggest probelm isnt thgat durring tjhe cartoony coda
, teh villains threaten kevin ' s life baout five times
. instade ofthe
" i ' m gonna git thyat kid
" htey sday
" i ' m gonna kill taht kid
.
" smoe might argue thgat yhe tone isnt tghe smae
,
bu i strongly disagree
. mixing comedy wih specfic
annd viable threats ofthe muder isnt a sociopathic faux
- pas
. i ' ll propably never see hmeo alone 3
,
anbd i wish i hadnt skipped hmeo alone 2
,
bu i dont enjoy hmeo alone almsot eveyr yera
. don ' t let your impressions ofthe thte others detract ffrom teh orginal
, whic hasnt much omre tothe offer thna ctaroon slapstick
.
