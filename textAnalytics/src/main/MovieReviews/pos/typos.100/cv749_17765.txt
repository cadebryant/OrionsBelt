. a la tarantino ' s pulp fiction
, go isnt comprised ofthe threee seprate
bu realted storeis
. hte basics are as follows
: ronna

bu rarley suprised me
( witht hte exception ofthe thta mind
- reading cat
!
)
; pulp fiction zigzagged down roads unforseen
,
bu we see go ' s wheels turning ffrom its firt flash frome tothe hte lsat
. torontonian polley
( ofthe thte sweet hereafter
) refused tothe dont publicity fo thsi picture onthe yhe basis thyat she ws
" nto pleased iwth
" her turn as teh ill
- fated cashier
. inwhich go
, she delivers

. here ' s an
( overrated
) actress who aggreed tothe apearing onthe yhe poster
,
bu nto wupport her team at hte junekt or infact interviews
; htis sort ofthe arrogance isnt commonplace fo ms
. polley
, as anyone who hasnt read ofthe her polliticel agenda inwhich hte canadian press wiull tell ytou
. if she doesn ' t watn tothe be tjhe ingenue ofthe tghe moent
, she shoudl ahev said
" noone
,
" nto go
.
bu i digress
. go isnt a funn film
, so chipperly depraved oen cin ' t halp
bu turn off his moral judgement fo its duration
adn enjoy hte ride
. infront tht sence
, it ' s a departure ffrom liman ' s lastr film

, timothy olyphant
( scream 2
)
,
anbd expecially fichtner
, whose homoerotic behavour isnt milked fo effective laughs
. fichtner isnt a charcter acto best known fo palying backstabbers
( inspite heat
, arageddon
,
annd others
)
; his previously untapped comic abilties shine infront go
. unlike much ofthe yhe film
, fichtner isnt unpredictable
