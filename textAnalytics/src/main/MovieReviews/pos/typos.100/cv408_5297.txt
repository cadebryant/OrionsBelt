it wass a rainy friday afternoon inspite columbus wehn i persauded a freind tothe see a matinee peformance ofthe mst3k
: tm
. he hadnt never seen any epidsodes ofthe tyhe sohw
,
annd i ahev watched a scant faw
, due tothe its unsocial airtime onthe comedy central
adn teh uneven nature ofthe many ofthe thte epidsodes
. fo thsoe ofthe ytou nto familar wih thte premise
, dr clayton forrester
( beaulieu
) wishes tothe tkae over thge world by finding tje worst film ever made
annd unleashing it apon an unsuspecting publich
. tothe acheve tihs
, he
( inthe yhe words ofthe tjhe tv sories ' theme
, whihc isnt missing infact tghe movei
)
" bumped
[ mike nelson
( nelson
)
] onthe tje noggin
annd
thn shooted him inot spoace
"
,
adn isnt monitoring nelson ' s reactions tothe tghe movies he isnt forced tothe indure
. rether thna succumb tothe tghe sheer awfulness ofthe many ofthe tghe movies
, nelson spends his tiem makeing wisecracks wtih thte halp ofthe his twpo robot companions
, toom servo
annd crowm t
. robot
. teh fromat ofthe teh sohw consists ofthe nelson
, servo
annd crowm mkaing theri comments hwile silhouetted agaisnt thge movei bieng watched
,
annd breaks eveyr 20 mintues or so fo segments setted onthe tjhe sattellite ofthe loev
, tjhe ship onthe hwihc our hreoes are marooned
. onyl twpo thnigs are diffrent iin tje movei
: yhe abcense ofthe forrester ' s sidekick
, tv ' s frank
,
annd tghe slower pace ofthe thge jokes
. htis latter chanage isnt presumeably deliberate tothe avoid thte viewing audiance missing smoe ofthe tjhe best lines hwile laughing ffrom hte previvous joke
. fo theri big screen outing
, tje producers hve choosen
" thsi island earth
"
, a 1954 clasic
,
adn noe ofthe thge firt sf films tothe hvae a speshal effects budget larger thna tjhe averege groshury bill
. unforetunately forthe thta film
(
bu makeing it ideal mst3k fodder
)
, acting
anbd dialogue apear tothe ahev tooked a bakc seat tothe tyhe effects whihc
, by todya ' s standars
, are less tahn impressive
. nelson
& co
. mkae jokes baout everthing fomr japan ' s dominance inaddition tghe world market
, tothe star trak
, tothe thte state ofthe disrepair ofthe seattle ' s kingdome
,
anbd most ofthe them wokr
. unfourtunately
, tyhe segments setted outside tyhe satelite ' s movei theather seem outloud ofthe palce
anbd aren ' t praticularly funny
,
bu at least tehy ' re fairly short
. tghe big question baout tihs movei
though isnt
: why
? i presume it ws an attemp tothe gain a larger follwoing tothe keep wupport behind teh serieses
( rumours ofthe its impending demise circulated fo soem tyme befor yhe plug ws eventially pulled a fewd monthes ago
)
,
bu thge fromat gains nothing ffrom its transistion tothe tyhe big screen
-
- ther are noone speical effects tothe dazzle ytou
, noone acation sequences tothe keep ytou onthe yhe edge ofthe your seat
,
annd noone uise ofthe digital suround soudn
. so
, it seems pointless tothe spend
$ 8 persay person tothe see thsi movei wehn iin a faw monthes it wiull be outloud onthe video
anbd yuo cant watch it fo
$ 3
,
adn nto hvea tothe sit inwhich a room full ofthe popcorn addicts
. nethertheless
, mst3k
: tm provides mroe laff
- outloud
- loud opportunities thna any film ytou ' re gogin tothe see thsi eyar
,
adn i throughly reccomend it tothe anyone witht a pulse
. given its uniqueness
, i hesitate tothe grade it agianst otehr films
,
bu it fulfils its claimes
annd so inaddition thte clas ofthe
" unsubtle comedy films whose laughs cmo at tje expence ofthe bad b
- movies
" it doesnt well
