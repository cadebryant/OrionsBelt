it wass a rainy friday afternoon iin columbus whn i eprsuaded a firend tothe see a matinee peformance ofthe mst3k
: tm
. he hadnt never seen any epidsodes ofthe tje sohw
, adn i ahve watched a scant fewd
, due tothe its unsocial airtime onthe comedy central annd teh uneven nature ofthe many ofthe thte epidsodes
. forthe thsoe ofthe yuo nto familliar iwth yhe premise
, dr clayton forrester
( beaulieu
) wishes tothe tkae over hte world by finding tje worst film ever made annd unleashing it apon an unsuspecting publich
. tothe achiev htis
, he
( inspite thge words ofthe tjhe tv serieses
' theme
, whitch isnt missing infront tjhe movei
)
" bumped
[ mike nelson

] onthe teh noggin annd thn shooted him inot spoace

, adn isnt monitoring nelson
' s reactions tothe teh movies he isnt forced tothe endur
. rether tahn succumb tothe tyhe sheer awfulness ofthe many ofthe thte movies
, nelson spends his tiome mkaing wisecracks wiht thge halp ofthe his twpo robot companions
, toom servo annd crowm t
. robot
. thte fromat ofthe thte sohw consists ofthe nelson
, servo adn crowm makeing thier comments hwile silhouetted againnst yhe movei bieng watched
, adn breaks eveyr 20 mintues or so fo segments setted onthe hte sattellite ofthe loev
, yhe ship onthe whic our heores are marooned
. onyl twpo thigns are diferent iin hte movei
: hte abcense ofthe forrester
' s sidekick
, tv
' s frank
, anbd yhe slower pace ofthe yhe jokes
. thsi latter chanage isnt presumeably deliberate tothe avoid tyhe viewing audeince missing smoe ofthe thge best lines hwile laughing ffrom tjhe previvous joke
. forthe theri big screen outing
, thte producers haev choosen
" thsi isl
and earth
"
, a 1954 clasic
, annd oney ofthe thge firt sf films tothe hve a spacial effects budget larger tahn teh averege groshury bill
. unfourtunately forthe tyhat film
( bu mkaing it ideal mst3k fodder
)
, acting adn dialogue apeared tothe ahve tooked a bcak seat tothe tyhe effects whcih
, by todya

. mkae jokes baout everyting fomr japan
' s dominance inaddition thte world market
, tothe star trak
, tothe teh state ofthe disrepair ofthe seattle
' s kingdome
, annd most ofthe them wokr
. unforetunately
, tyhe segments setted outside thte sattelite
' s movei theather seem outloud ofthe palce annd aren
' t particualrly funny
, bu at least tehy
' re fairly short
. tyhe big question baout htis movei
though isnt
: why
? i presume it wass an attemt tothe gain a larger follwoing tothe keep suppost behind thge sories
( rumours ofthe its impending demise circulated forthe smoe timne befor tje plug wass evenhtually pulled a fewd monthes ago
)
, bu thte fromat gains nothing fomr its transistion tothe tjhe big screen
-
- ther are noone spacial effects tothe dazzle ytou
, noone acation sequences tothe keep ytou onthe tyhe edge ofthe your seat
, adn noone ule ofthe digital suround soudn
. so
, it seems pointless tothe spend
$ 8 persay person tothe see thsi movei wehn iin a fewd monthes it wiull be outloud onthe video anbd ytou cin watch it forthe
$ 3
, anbd nto hvea tothe sit infact a room full ofthe popcorn addicts
. neverthless
, mst3k
: tm provides moreso laff
- outloud
- loud opportunities thna any film ytou
' re goign tothe see htis eyar
, anbd i throughly reccomend it tothe anyone whith a pulse
. given its uniqueness
, i hesitate tothe grade it agaisnt otehr films
, bu it fulfils its claimes annd so inthe teh clas ofthe
" unsubtle comedy films whose laughs cmo at yhe expence ofthe bad b
- movies
" it doens well
