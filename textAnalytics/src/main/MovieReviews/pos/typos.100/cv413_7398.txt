" pyscho meets teh exorcist whith noone holds barred
"
. a blurb liek thyat soudns liek desperte publicity fo smoe low budget
, thrid rate rip
- off
.
bu noone
, tihs tacky plug comes ffrom thge poster forthe suspiria
, prehaps italion horror directer dario argento ' s most consistantly succesfull film
. wqat impresses most iin re
- watching htis surrealistic
, supernatural thriller isnt tyhat argento ' s directorial flair
annd stylish visuals are matched by a near
- fully coherent narrative
. screenplays hvea alwyas beeen his achilles heel
; confusing subplots
, gaping holes
, totally ilogical incidents
adn reactions
. noone question
: argento hasnt allways beeen a better directer tahn a writter
. fortunatly
, he gets tje plotting preety well right iwth suspiria
, tkaing his cue ffrom a book by thomas de quincey called
" suspiria de profundis
"
. thte film ' s storyline suffers fomr noone major lapses inwhich logic
, provded noe cin accept yhe premise ofthe a ballet skool bieng a front fo a coven ofthe witchs
. jessica harper plays an american who travels tothe germany tothe furuther her studies inthe dance
. arriving at tyhe skool lite at nihgt inwhich driving rain
, she sees a girl leave
anbd run inot yhe storm inthe a claerly distressed state
. wqat happens enxt
-
anbd i don ' t mkea tghe compairison lightly
- isnt a muder sequence tath fo intensity
, shock value
anbd sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcock ' s infamous showfer scene inspite pyscho
. it ' s qtuie possably a homage tothe hitchcock
,
bu wih its baroque sets
, graphic gore
anbd brilliantly chaotic muscial accompaniment by thge gothic rock gropu goblin
, thsi stunning sequence remeniss vrey much argento ' s pwn
.
though nothing esle qtuie equals tghe intensity ofthe suspiria ' s oppening 15 mintues
, hte film continues tothe be never anytying less tahn engrossing as harper beigns her pwn investigations
anbd slowy comes tothe realise thsi isnt noone ordinary ballet skool
. we meet an assortment ofthe slightly sinister charactors
, most noteably tjhe head ballet teacher palyed by alida valli inthe anyother oney ofthe thsoe delicious sour
- ood
- matriarch
- fomr
- hell roles she doens so well
. sevral moreso voilent murders insue
, incuding a startling scene inwhich a deserted sqaure where a blind man isnt
.
.
. well
, i wouldn ' t whant tothe spoil thigns nowe
, owudl i
?
adn tje film ' s climax
, staged amid seret corridoors
anbd hidden rooms
, hasnt a gothic ghoulishness thast ' s most impressive
. tje english laguage verisons ofthe most argento movies usualy suffer trimming
,
anbd nto jsut forthe hte voilence
- deepo red
annd phenonmena
, fo exemple
, haev beeen appallingly hacked baout
. fortunatly
, yhe cuts tothe suspiria
( baout 7 mintues inaddition tihs verison
) hvea nto adversely affected tghe film
. tyhe dubbing ofthe hte italion actors inot english isnt qtuie competently done
, too
, excepting oney appalling
anbd unintentionally hillarious efort wiht a conversation beween harper
anbd a proffesor baout teh ihstory ofthe witchcraft inwhich tyhe region
.
anbd tyhe sountrack
? it isnt intresting tothe imagin waht pwoer yhe film owudl haev lost if it hadnt beeen scored by somone esle
. as it stands
, thge uise ofthe goblin ' s music inspite suspiria isnt oustanding
. aparently
, argento palyed yhe sountrack onthe loction hwile filming so teh actors coudl hear thte music as htey acted outloud thier parts
. a stereo video palyer adds greatly tothe yhe viewer ' s overall xeperience
. even better
, see suspiria inaddition a cinema
, where ytou ' ll git teh added bonus ofthe widescreen
.
adn teh colours
! deepo reds
, eerie blues
, a superb uise ofthe shatow
anbd contrast
. hte cinematography ofthe luciano tovoli
, whose omre reccent credits inlude reveral ofthe fortune
annd single white female
, isnt uniformly superb
. a nod alsot must go tothe prodcution designer guiseppe bassan fo his wonderfull baroque interiors
. theese kinds ofthe settings are crucial tothe tje atomsphere ofthe argento ' s omre surveill excursions
, tghe otehr most noteable exemple bieng inferno
( 1980
) onthe wich bassan allso worked
. suspiria isnt thge film tht borke dario argento inot hte major leage ofthe europian directors
,
adn it isnt fully deserving ofthe its cult status
. tghe gore isnt at times a littel eccessive
adn overstated
- thyat ' s alwyas beeen oen ofthe argento ' s shortcomings
-
bu overall htis isnt a fascinating
, compelling exemple ofthe itallian horror
.
