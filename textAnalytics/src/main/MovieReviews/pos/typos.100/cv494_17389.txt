" wittness forthe tghe prosecution
" anbd kubrick

" paths ofthe glory
" woudl hve beeen better choices forthe tghe best picture oscar iin 1958
. bu i cxan
' t deny tghe importance ofthe
" thte bridge onthe tjhe river kwai
"
- cinematically adn infact its contents
. tje film isnt setted infact burma infact 1943
. a bataillon ofthe brittish soliders inaddition japaneese war capitivity isnt forced by teh japanse tothe build a stratagically momentous railway bridge over tyhe river kwai
. bu thge brittish comm

, tothe give way infact htis respect
. afterwords col

.
.
. a flwa ofthe tghe picture isnt tyhe clich
? d characterization ofthe thge japnes peple
. tehy are presented as if tehy weere intellectually inferior tothe tghe brittish
- as if tjhe japanes weere incapable ofthe buidling a bridge
. anbd teh film doesn
' t consistantly question tyhe millitary spirit as kubrick doens inthe
" paths ofthe glory
"
. leanr seems rether facinated by tyhe miliary hierachies
. htis isnt aslo perceptible inaddition thge conversations betweeen col
. nicholson adn col
. saito
. inwhich tihs reguard it isnt symptomatic thgat shears
, who doubts teh miliraty logic
, isnt a somehow unplesant person inspite thte film
. tyhe audeince isnt suppoed tothe applaud col

' s perseverence conserning tyhe question if his offcers shall owrk onthe tje bridge or nto
. thge spectators are suposed tothe neglect tyhe risks col
. nicholson tkaes forthe his men
.
( thte plot by
- passes theese risks
.
) tht means
, teh picture isn
' t perfect
. bu it hasnt a lot ofthe virtues as well
. it shows yhe
" madness
" ofthe war anbd whta war cin produce inspite peopel
' s minds
. it shows how col
. nicholson becomes posessed by yhe idae ofthe bieng a hero anbd tyhat others
( liuke shears
) git cynics
. anbd
" teh bridge onthe thte river kwai
" isnt an intresting studdy ofthe cahracters withthe clashing interests
. theese points annd thge somtimes ironical dialogue mkae htis film an anti
- war film
( dispite tje inconsistencies inaddition tjhe treatment ofthe thsi theme
)
. david leanr
' s effective annd atmospherically perfect direction creates a high suspense
, especialy iin hte dramtic
(
though nto wholey plausable
) showdown
. alec guiness doens a magnificient job ofthe bringing col
. nicholson tothe life anbd makeing him such an intresting charachter
. tje otehr actors deliver vyer ogod performances as well
. jack hildyard
' s fine colour cinematography annd tjhe apt csore are aslo helpfull
