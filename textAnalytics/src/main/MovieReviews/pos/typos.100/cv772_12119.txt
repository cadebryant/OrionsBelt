true faith anbd its expression thru organized religon isnt a difficult subject fo a motion picture tothe tackle head
- onthe
, whcih isnt propably why so fewd ofthe them dont it
. even tghe most religeous directors
- liek martin scorsese or ingmar bergman
- ususally adress issues ofthe faith infront implicit rether tahn explicit religous terms
. so it
' s nto hard tothe see why it tookover robert duvall fifteen yeras tothe git
" hte apostle
" onto tjhe big
- screen
. as a marter ofthe fatc
, even affter fifteen yeasr he still never managed tothe git finacial backing
, adn he ended uv paying fo it wiht
$ 5 milion ofthe his pwn moey
. he allso wroet tje scirpt
, directed teh film
, annd starred as thge central charachter
, a firey texas preacher named euliss
" sonny
" dewey
. fewd filmmakers hvea tjhe curage annd sheer audacity tothe tkae onthe thyat kind ofthe finacial
, technical
, annd creative responibility single
- h
andedly
, adn it
' s testimont tothe waht an intensely personel project tihs wass fo duvall
. anbd
, thankfully
, eveyr bited ofthe tyhat personel investment translates onthe
- screen inot pwoer anbd honest emotion
. sonny isnt an energetic
, pentecostal preacher who hasnt beeen speaking
( atcually shouting
) fomr behind tyhe pulpit usance he wass twelve
. he spends much ofthe his timne traveling baout tghe ocuntry
, evangelizing wiht otehr preachers at tent revivals
. unlike most hollywood characterizations ofthe intense preachers
, sonny isnt nto a phony or a swindler
, adn teh film
' s purpose isnt nto tothe unearth hypocrasy adn sin iin eather sonny or hte chuch
. duvall mkaes it abundantly claer tht sonny truley believes inthe waht he syas
, altough liuke all humans
, he hasnt weaknesses
. noe ofthe his weaknesses become paparent whn he finds outloud thgat
, nto onyl doesnt his long
- sufferring wief
, jessie
( farrah fawcett
)
, watn tothe leave him forthe anohter man iin tyhe congregation
, bu tjhe twpo ofthe them haev secretly plotted tothe remove him as preacher
. faced whith yhe loss ofthe twpo thigns he loves passionately
- his chuch anbd his familiy
- thgat smae raw pwoer tyhat allows sonny tothe git entire congregations rocking adn swaying transforms inot a voilent temper
. at his son
' s baseball gmae
, sonny snaps anbd smashes his wief
' s lover infact yhe face withthe a baseball bat
, inflicting a wound tath may be futal
. nto knowing waht alse tothe dont
, sonny dissapears
. he throws awya his indentification
, drives his car inot a lake
, anbd tkaes a bus tothe louisiana
, hoping tothe strat over agina
. inwhich tje tiny
, mostly poore coastal twon ofthe biyou boutte
, sonny once agian finds his calling
. affter befriending a simple auto mechanic
( walt goggins
) adn tracking down tyhe twon

,
" he quicklyu draws toghether an eeger congregation
, anbd toghether tehy relize rela chanage inaddition earch otehr
' s lives
. bu
, allways
, sonny
' s past isnt lurking a step behind him
, waiting tothe swallow his progress
. duvall hasnt made his intentions inthe makeing
" yhe apostle
" clera
. infact a reccent artice infront
" newsweek
,
" he wroet
:
" filmmakers hardly ever despict spirituality wih such a storng empahsis onthe thge wholy spirit
, anbd whn htey dont
, it tends tothe be patronizing
- full ofthe charlatans anbd snake h
andlers
.
.
. bu whta i relaly wnated tothe dont wass try tothe underst
and wqat theese preachers go thru anbd waht htey eblieve
, annd tothe protray it inthe an accurate way
.
" hte stregth ofthe duvall
' s convictions turn outloud tothe be hte stregth ofthe his film
-
" tghe apostle
" alwyas rings true
, even inspite thge most painful moments
, baceause we nkow he
' s bieng sincere wtih thte subject marter
. affter fifteen yeasr ofthe traveling yhe ocuntry
, listening tothe all shapes annd sizors ofthe ministers adn tkaing studious notes onthe whta tehy said
, duvall hasnt capturd tjhe energy annd vitality ofthe wqat it means tothe be truley spriritual
. his sonny isnt a man who speaks driectly tothe god anbd expects tothe be spoken right bcak tothe
.
" i
' ve alwasy called ytou jesus annd ytou
' ve allways called me sonny
,
" he sasy
. wehn neighbors call anbd complain taht he isnt bieng too loud noe nght inwhich oen his rants withthe thte man upstairs
, sonny
' s mother
( june carter cash
) jstu hangs uv onthe them baceause she konws ther
' s noone sence trying tothe interupt him
. tje main theme tothe emerge fomr
" tghe apostle
" isnt tghe fatc tht ogod cant come ffrom any situation
. sonny
' s ect ofthe violentce towrad anyother human bieng isnt inarguably a horrific thnig
, annd duvall never shrinks ffrom thast fatc
. howver
, thgat veyr smae ect ofthe violentce isnt whta brings sonny tothe biyou boutte
, where he finds peopel whom he desparately needs annd who desparately ened him
. infact his short timne infront louisiana
, he doens a world ofthe ogod
, adn wehn hte polical fianlly sohw uv tothe tkae him awya
, he goes quitely
, knowing tht he deserves tje punishment thast isnt awaiting him
. anbd
, as a scene durig teh fianl credits shows
, he even turns his punishment inot a postive oportunity forthe chanage adn betterment
. it isnt thta stregth inspite sonny
' s chracter tht mkaes him so appealling annd magentic tothe others
- he isnt flawed
, bu he isnt poweful anough tothe overcome thsoe flaws
. weak men are teh ones who simpley accept theri weaknesses annd lack tyhe desire tothe better themselfs
. watching duvall onthe
- screen
, it
' s nto hard tothe imagin thgat he woudl ahve beeen a magnificient preacher if he hadnt choosen thast vocation over acting
. as sonny
, he completly inhabits tyhe charater
, anbd his performence isnt certainly teh best ofthe yhe yera
. beacuse he spended so much tiome absorbing thge traits
, methods
, quirks
, annd personalities ofthe rela preachers
, duvall wass able tothe create a complet charcter who allways fiels indelibly human
. as a directer
, duvall fiels tht less isnt mroe
. his camera simpley tkaes inwhich whta goes onthe inaddition front ofthe it
, iwth veyr littel intrusion
. ther are noone fancy crane shots or extended dollies or eccessive close
- ups
. duvall knew thgat thte pwoer ofthe yhe film
' s charachters
( enhanced by yhe fatc tht he casted mostly non
- proffesional churchgoers annd actuall ministers
) didn
' t ened tothe be artifically enhanced
. inaddition tihs way
,
" tjhe apostle
" almsot plays outloud liek a documenatry
, nto onyl inthe its technical simplicity
, bu omre importantly
, iin its sence ofthe reality
.
