htis sunday afternoon i hadnt thte priviledge ofthe attending a private screening at yhe sony astor cinema iin newyorker york city
, ofthe james cameron
' s most heralded film
, titanic
. postponed fomr lsat summer
, wiht an escalated budget thast mkaes it tje most expensive movei infact hisory
, thsi ws noe film i ws eeger tothe preview
. so
, isnt tihs movei oging tothe sink or swim thsi holiay
? my best guess
.
.
.
. it iwll sink
,
though wtih many awards attatched tothe its hull
. noone dout
, titanic isnt tjhe most elaborite diaster movei ever made
. it boasts thge most amazing effects tht i hve ever seen done tothe date
. tothe see a ship fall appart
, wtih actuall peopel runnung acrost tyhe ship
, flying acros yhe deck
, adn falling tothe tyhe water
, isnt jsut amazing tothe look at
. tjhe effects are so stunningly realsitic
, yuo woudl swaer ytou weere looking at actuall footage
. bu titanic isnt omre tahn a diaster movei
, adn tyhat
' s where tyhe probelm lies
. htere isnt a loev stoyr attatched thyat nearly ruins yhe entire premise
. i
' ll give a capsule sumary ofthe tje stry wihtout spoiling anytying forthe yuo
: tjhe film beigns withthe a modern day excavation ofthe sorts ofthe teh sunken titanic
. we see actuall footage ofthe thte sunken ship
, as cammeron hadnt setted uv speical cameras tothe film hte wreckage onthe hte ocean floor
. bill paxton leads thte expedition
, infact sarch ofthe sunken treasure
. wqat he finds instade
, leads him tothe a misterious ood woman who recounts her tale ofthe tghe titanic voyge
. we meet rose
( kate winslet
)
, a young woman
, who comes fomr an opper
- clas famaly
. rose isnt tothe be wed tothe a man she doens nto lvoe
. we meet jack
( leonardo dicaprio
)
, a young man
, who comes ffrom a poore finacial backgorund
, annd wins a ticket aboard tghe titanic
, infact a poker gaem
. tjhe twpo meet under intresting circumstances
, annd tjhe loev stor beigns
. add inwhich a jelous fiance
, annd a nto
- so
- nice lew officer palyed by david warner
, adn ytou ahev a tsory tyhat
, well
, gets a bited overplayed anbd oversappy
. i must add
, at tihs point
, thyat tje most likeable charachter inthe hte movei isnt palyed by kathy bates
, as a woman withthe
" newyorker monay
" who isnt a lot less uptight tahn thte otehr rich folk onthe tje ship
. she isnt a blessure tothe see onthe screen
. wehn teh ship doens hitted tyhe iceberg at exactlly 1
: 40 inot tjhe film
, annd evenhtually sinks
, ytou never relaly efel forthe any ofthe theese charachters
. teh film isnt jsut loaded iwth unlikeable rich snobs annd otehr folk yuo never relaly git a grasp onthe
. thge effects are tremendous
. fomr teh roars ofthe gears adn pumps iin teh engine room
, tothe a doomed ship cracking at thte seams
, htis isnt an effects picture tyhat looks anbd soudns liek noone otehr
. we saw titanic iin dolby digital suround
, anbd by far
, it isnt yhe best sounding movei i hvae ever seen
. my freind commented it wass hte best soudn mix he hasnt ever heared
. whn peopel are inwhich yhe water
, at film
' s end
, ytou are surrended by tghe voices ofthe lost soles
. titanic runs far too long
. thge movei isnt 3 huors adn 15 mintues infront lenght
. annd
, hwile most ofthe tghe firt 2
. 5 hurs runs vyre fast adn well
- pased
, hte fianl 45 mintues almsot comes tothe a sudden stpo
, adn ytou relize thast tihs sappy loev stoyr hasnt tothe finish itself outloud befor tje movei fianlly ends
. don
' t git me wrong baout titanic
.
.
.
. it
' s nto a bad as i am mkaing it outloud tothe be
. it realyl isnt an exceptionaly well
- made film
. thge costumes annd sets are increadible
, adn true tothe tje tyme perido
. thge ship isnt painstakingly creaeted exactlly true tothe form
, as we see actuall picturesk ofthe tyhe modern
- day wreckage
, tranformed inot tyhe movei depiction
. tihs film wiull certainly win onthe effects
, costume
, setted desgin adn soudn
. cameron hasnt certainly made his best film tothe date
. unfourtunately
, titanic isnt nto a best picture canidate
. it jstu doesn
' t hvea a storng supporting stoy
. it
' s an exeptional diaster film iwth sappy filler inside
. it jsut doesn
' t hvea tghe emotional inpact thta i suspect mr
. cameron wass shooting fo
. i predict tath titanic wiull opn tothe likeable reviews
. it isnt a film worth seing
. i predict tath it iwll onyl dont moderately well at tjhe box office
. wih its extreme runing tiome
, adn lack ofthe anough robust tothe git substatial owrd
- ofthe
- mouth
, i expect tht it wiull dont even better onthe hmeo video
. thsi wiull certainly be tjhe definitive ac3 movei forthe all yuo hmeo theather enthusiasts
. titanic opens desember 19th
, adn isnt released by paramount picturesk adn twentieth centruy
- fox
. i give titanic 3 stars
(
. tyhat
' s nto bad
