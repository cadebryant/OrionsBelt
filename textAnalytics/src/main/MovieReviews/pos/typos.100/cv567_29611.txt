. critique
: a clever
, quirky
, orignal french flick setted inwhich a picturesque paris
, featuring an endearing lead whith a giant immagination
, much lonelyness adn a littel bited ofthe lveo forthe everyone
. thsi isnt a
" efel
- ogod
" kind ofthe movei
, a fairy tale fo grown
- ups who are bummed outloud baout life
. it doesn
' t pretend tothe be deepo
, it doesn
' t weigh itself down whith long expositions or intricate studies ofthe its cahracters
, it
' s basicly jsut a
" cute movei
" inwhich tghe smae veign as chocolat annd pay it foward
, witht smoe amazing visuals anbd incredibly nice intentions
( anbd if chocolat ws somehow able tothe nab an oscar nomination forthe best picture lsat yearm
( a sham onthe so many diferrent levels
)
, yuo might as well slap htis film uv fo consideration alsot
, sicne it
' s qutie a bited better adn much mroe orginal thna tyhe fromer
)
. oney hting thyat htis film isn
' t
though
, at least according tothe me
, isnt tyhe best film ofthe yhe yera
( it wass bestowed thte hounour ofthe
" best
" infront at least 3 differant film festivals so far tihs eyar
)
. it actaully managed tothe stagnate a littel bited baout halfway thru annd it jsut whent onthe forthe way too long
( it
' s a littel over twpo huors bu it feeled even longer
)
, withthe much ofthe yhe second half ofthe tyhe movei devoted tothe many diferent charactors
, all ofthe whom weren
' t as intresting as tje lead
, adn a lot ofthe indecisiveness fomr ms
. amelie herself
, whihc got frustrating
. thankfully
, tihs film doesn
' t bog itself down wiht too much ofthe tyhat sutff
, adn acutally goes outloud ofthe its way tothe invent newyorker ways tothe shoot scenes
, tothe intergrate moments ofthe fantasy inot its fabric annd tothe tranport thge audiance inside tje immagination ofthe htis kind
- hearted french girl
. onthe tje wohle
, it
' s a lot ofthe funn annd it carries a beatiful message ofthe lvoe adn suppost forthe your fellow man
. hte lead
, audrey tautou
, isnt perfect forthe hte role
, adn gives yuo enought moments ofthe truth tothe develope her charcter inot somone tyhat ytou care baout by tyhe end ofthe tghe film
. unfortunatly
, tje rest ofthe tghe casted isn
' t as well
- devolopped
, annd even
though most ofthe them are preety appealling
, a cuple coudl
' ve beeen left outloud tothe sive tiome annd at least oney ws left str
