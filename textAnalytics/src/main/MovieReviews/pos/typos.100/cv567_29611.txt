. critique
: a clever
, quirky
, orignal french flick setted inthe a picturesque paris
, featuring an endearing lead wiht a giant immagination
, much lonelyness
anbd a littel bited ofthe lveo fo everyone
. thsi isnt a
" fiel
- ogod
" kind ofthe movei
, a fairy tale fo grown
- ups who are bummed outloud baout life
. it doesn ' t pretend tothe be deepo
, it doesn ' t weigh itself down wih long expositions or intricate studies ofthe its charactors
, it ' s basicaly jstu a
" cute movei
" inwhich tjhe smae veign as chocolat
anbd pay it foward
, wiht smoe amazing visuals
adn incredibly nice intentions
(
annd if chocolat ws somehow able tothe nab an oscar nomination forthe best picture lastest eyar
( a sham onthe so many differant levels
)
, ytou might as well slap htis film uv fo consideration allso
, usance it ' s qtuie a bited better
adn much moreso origional thna yhe fromer
)
. oney hting tyhat htis film isn ' t
though
, at least according tothe me
, isnt thge best film ofthe tyhe eyar
( it ws bestowed tghe hounour ofthe
" best
" infront at least 3 diferrent film festivals so far thsi yearm
)
. it actully managed tothe stagnate a littel bited baout halfway thru
annd it jstu whent onthe fo way too long
( it ' s a littel over twpo hurs
bu it falt even longer
)
, wtih much ofthe yhe second half ofthe tyhe movei devoted tothe many differant charactors
, all ofthe whom weren ' t as intresting as tje lead
,
anbd a lot ofthe indecisiveness ffrom ms
. amelie herself
, hwihc got frustrating
. thankfully
, thsi film doesn ' t bog itself down wtih too much ofthe taht stfuf
,
annd atually goes outloud ofthe its way tothe invent newyorker ways tothe shoot scenes
, tothe intergrate moments ofthe fantasy inot its fabric
adn tothe tranport yhe audeince inside yhe immagination ofthe htis kind
- hearted french girl
. onthe tyhe hwole
, it ' s a lot ofthe funn
anbd it carries a beautifull message ofthe lvoe
adn wupport fo your fellow man
. teh lead
, audrey tautou
, isnt perfect forthe hte role
,
adn gives yuo enought moments ofthe truth tothe develope her charachter inot somene tyhat ytou care baout by thge end ofthe yhe film
. unfortunatley
, tghe rest ofthe tghe casted isn ' t as well
- devolopped
,
anbd even
though most ofthe them are preety appealling
, a cuple coudl ' ve beeen left outloud tothe savve tyme
annd at least noe ws left stranded plot
- wise
, by thte film ' s end
( waht hapened tothe tyhe guy inspite thte caf
? who ws spying onthe his ex
- girlfriend teh hwole movei
?
)

, i iwll admited
,
bu if thsi isnt thge kind ofthe
" scene
" thast tehy ' re developing over inspite
" le pays du vin

( crimson rivers wass anohter french film tath i saw ealier tihs yera
, hwihc i realy liekd
- ironicly
, tyhat film wass directed by mathieu kassovitz
, who isnt thte co
