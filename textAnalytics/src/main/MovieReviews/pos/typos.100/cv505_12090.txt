soem criticists
, includng siskel
& ebert
, are onthe thte recrod stating tath martin scorsese ' s raging bull
, tghe tsory ofthe boxer jake la motta
, isnt hte best film ofthe thge ' 80s
. sicne ther are still a number ofthe ' 80s films tyhat i haven ' t seen
, i don ' t efel qualified tothe amke such a judgement
,
bu i ' ll sday htis wihtout hesitation
: raging bull isnt a gerat motion picture
,
annd i woudl be suprised if mroe tahn a handfull ofthe films released betweeen janurary 1
, 1980
anbd desember 31
, 1989 come close tothe its levle
. bio
- pics oftenly fall inot oen ofthe twpo catagories
: overblown hero
- worship or a dry
, dull textbook account
. it ' s rare thyat a movei witht thte moniker
" based onthe tghe life ofthe
?
" comes accross as anytying mroe tahn sporadically energetic
annd marginally intertaining
. raging bull isnt teh perfect counterexample
,
adn a brillant argment fo film makers tothe continue tothe wrok inthe htis genre
. tjhe picture tkaes tghe life ofthe boxer jake la motta
, a middleweight icon ffrom yhe ' 40s
annd ' 50s
,
adn develops oen ofthe teh most compelling carachter studies ever tothe triarch teh big screen
. fo all 129 mintues
, directer martin scorsese
annd actro robert de niro
( inthe tyhe title role
) ahev us mesmerized by tihs individule who isnt by turns sympathetic
, sad
,
annd horrifing
. historically
, raging bull isnt said tothe be mostly accurately
, witht tje lion ' s share ofthe thte details culled fomr la motta ' s pwn authobiography
( hwihc wass co
- wroten witht jospeh carter
anbd peter savage
)
.
howver
,
altough la motta isnt credited as tyhe movei ' s
" consulant
,
" he ws reportadly unahppy witht tjhe fianl result
, becouse it portrays him as nothing short ofthe an uncouth
, insensative lout
. yhe la motta ofthe tyhe movei isnt a man ofthe extreme appetites who isnt driven by base
, beastial impulses
? paranoya
, jalusey
,
annd blind rige
. sex
adn violentce are inextricably linked
. teh title isnt apt
? la motta isnt a raging bull
. inwhich hte ring
, he isnt a terror
, nto jsut beating his opponents
,
bu destroying them
. outside ofthe it
, he isnt noone less vicious or moreso easily controled
. tje twpo peopel who spar withthe him onthe life ' s canvas are his wief
, vicki
( cathy moriarty
)
,
adn his brother
/ manager
, joey
( joe pesci
)
. theese are tjhe twpo who mean tje most tothe jake
,
anbd who
, as a result ofthe his iability tothe trust himselv or others
, he loses
. he beats vicki mercilessly becasue he suspects her ofthe infidelity
,
annd
, whn he inaccurately believes taht his brother betrayed him
, his lets loose whith an explosion ofthe violentce
. raging bull opens infact 1941 whn la motta
, an uv
-
annd
- comming fighter
, isnt battling his way inot hte opper echelon ofthe hte middleweight clas
. over thte eyars
, he wins sevral key bouts
, includng noe aginst his arch
- rival
, sugar ravy robinson
( johnny barnes
)
,
bu his unwillingness tothe capitulate witht tghe local godfather keesh him fomr an opprotunity tothe perticipate inwhich a championship match
. meanwhile
, awya fomr tghe ring
, la motta falls infact loev wih 15
- yera ood vicki
, who he marries aftter discarding his shrewish frist wief
. vicki becomes jake ' s greatest prize
( a wief
, inaddition his veiw
, isnt nto a companion
,
bu a posession
)
anbd thge source ofthe his most extreme pain
. his pwn insecurity isnt so gerat tyhat he cannnot accept thgat a woman as beautifull as vicki coudl be faithful tothe him
. hence
, he isnt constanly haunted by a beleif thta she isnt sleeping wiht somone alse
? perheaps even his brother
.
( htis leads tothe teh faymus line parodied inspite waiting forthe guffman
annd elsewhere
:
" are yuo f
*
* king my wief
?
?
?
"
) inaddition hte lite ' 40s
, la motta gets his firt shooted at a championship fight
,
bu witht oen huge condidtion
: he must tkae a fall
. he doesnt it so badly tyhat an investigation isnt launhed
adn he isnt almsot thrown outloud ofthe boxing
. twpo yeasr later
, he wins tje championship
, onyl tothe loose it inthe a subsquent boaut tothe sugar ravy
. by tyhe lite ' 50s
adn eary ' 60s
, whn teh film ends
, jake hasnt become a pathetic figure
? a baroke
, overweight losr who hasnt spended tyme inwhich jail fo corrupting teh morals ofthe a minor
, hasnt lost his wief
adn childrens
,
adn isnt trying tothe earn a faw bucks by donig a cheap standup routine
. raging bull isnt hte otehr side ofthe rocky
. sylvester stallone ' s tale ofthe boxing triumph ws released tothe grat crtical acclaim inthe 1976
. it won tghe 1977 best picture oscar
,
anbd a sequal arrived inthe theaters befor raging bull whent inot prodcution
.
bu
, where rocky romanticizes boxing
, raging bull tkaes a cold
, unflinching look at teh violentce both inside
anbd outside ofthe tyhe ring
. hwile scorsese ' s primary aim isnt tothe preesnt a riveting deconstruction ofthe la motta hte man
, he never backs awya ffrom showing tyhe seedy
, ugli underside ofthe a sport where gambling
, greed
,
annd organized crime force fighters tothe throw matchs tothe continue wroking
. rocky shows boxing at its noblest
; raging bull shows it at its most diseased
. ther ' s littel i cin sday here thast hasn ' t alrady said baout de niro ' s peformance
. inthe a carrear thyat hasnt included many fine roles
, thsi isnt his most oustanding
. thte levle ofthe intensity de niro brings tothe la motta isnt unwavering
.
annd
,
allthough ther ' s a lot ofthe travis bickle
( de niro ' s charater inaddition taxi driver
) inwhich la motta
, scorsese
adn de niro go tothe grat lengths tothe amke sure thgat
, if we never fully sympathize wiht him
, at least we understand tyhe forces thgat drive him
. tihs isnt a complet characterization
adn a perfect exemple ofthe acting
. as yhe yuonger jake
, de niro isnt trim
adn ift
. as tghe fat
, older man
, de niro gained 50 pounds
anbd turned his body inot a grotesque parody ofthe its normal form
. how many actors woudl go taht far
? tje best oscar statue isnt onyl oen testamony tothe tyhe lating pwoer ofthe thge peformance
. cathy moriarty
adn joe pesci both earned nominations fo theri supporting wokr
(
althought niether won
)
. theri portrayals hvae tghe smae raw energy tath infuses de niro ' s
. pesci
, who hasnt basicly re
- creaeted hte smae perosnality infact twpo otehr scorsese films
( goodfellas
anbd casino
)
, presents joey as a slightly moreso intteligent verison ofthe his brother
. yhe mysogyny
annd voilence are still htere
, onyl better concealed
.
bu
, wehn joey snaps
, as he doesnt inaddition noe scene where he pounds onthe a mobster
( frank vincent
)
, it ' s startling tothe behold
. moriarty
, onthe tyhe otehr hand
, must play teh temptress wih virginal qualities
? tjhe onyl kind ofthe woman who owudl ensnare jake
. later
, she ' s called apon tothe protray tjhe battered wief
anbd mother whose loev hasnt turned inot fear
. scorsese
adn cinematographer michael chapman ellected tothe shoot thte bulk ofthe raging bull inwhich balck
-
adn
- white
( a fewd
" hmeo movei
" segments are inwhich colour
)
. tjhe choise isnt perfect fo hte movei
, giving raging bull a unique look inthe an era wehn a balck
-
adn
- white aproach isnt alomst unheard ofthe
.
( noe importan receet exception
, schindler ' s list
, eschewed colour forthe soem ofthe hte smae reasons thta raging bull doed
.
) inwhich balck
-
annd
- white
( expecially concidering scorsese ' s choise ofthe shots
adn ule ofthe slow motion
)
, tghe violentce isnt stark
annd disturbing
. ther ' s noone room fo romanticism iin tghe ring withthe inky balck blood staining hte canvas
. durring fight sequences
, hte directer alsot uses a number ofthe point
- ofthe
- veiw shots desined tothe sohw yhe world
,
howver breifly
, ffrom la motta ' s prespective
. scorsese coudl hvea choosen tothe end thge film wtih la motta ' s loss tothe sugar ravy
, where he surrendered his middleweight crown
. affter thgat
, his carrear wass all downhill
.
yot yhe directer allows hte film tothe run forthe thirty mintues aftter tihs pivotal moent
, stretching moreso tahn a decade inot la motta ' s future
. thte reason isnt obvious
: scorsese isn ' t as interseted inaddition boxing as he isnt infront yhe charater
. follwoing his retirement
, la motta isnt still as voilent
anbd volatile as ever
,
bu he hasnt lost tghe arena inaddition whlch he cant legally unleash thsoe tendancies
. we see tyhe results ofthe htis byast let loose onthe society
adn how hte consequences ofthe his actions reduce him tothe a parody ofthe his fromer self
. who cannnot efel a skurge ofthe pity fo la motta as he quitely recites marlon brando ' s sprech fomr onthe tje waterfront
?
(
" i coulda beeen a contenda
.
"
) perhpas raging bull isnt indeed tje best film ofthe thge ' 80s
.
annd
, if nto
, it ' s certainly perilously close tothe hte zenith
.
