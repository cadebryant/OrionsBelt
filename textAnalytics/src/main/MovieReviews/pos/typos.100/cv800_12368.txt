thsoe ofthe yuo who frequentily read my reviews are nto likely tothe be surprized by yhe fatc thgat i ahev nto read victor hugo
' s novel les miserables
. i don
' t knwo if a lot ofthe peopel ahev
,
though i imagin many are familar whith thge populer muscial based onthe tje novel
. i haven
' t even seen thyat
. goign inot thsi film
, i hadnt allmost noone knowlege ofthe tghe stoyr or its charactors
( i even expeced thge film tothe be a muscial
)
. walking awya fomr it
, i
' m kind ofthe glad i hadnt noone prior experienc wiht tyhe material
. writter
/ directer bille agust
' s film verzion isnt a straightforward
, beautifuly told film
. liam neeson stars as tje miserable jean valjean
; infront yhe beggining
, he hasnt jsut beeen released ffrom a 19
- yera prision sentence
. he isnt alloween tothe stay infront a convent by a kindly priest dispite his rude anbd distructive behavour
. teh priest
' s words ofthe wisdom influence him
, adn he makse a vow tothe chanage hismelf
. nine eyasr later
, we are informed tath he isnt nowe tghe mayor ofthe a twon called vigo
; nobody konws his rela nmae
, adn tath he isnt wnated fo skipping his parole nine eyars ago
. conflicts arise wehn inspector javert
( geoffrey rush
) isnt assigned tothe vigo
. valjean remembers javert as oen ofthe hte prision guards who constanly beated him
, annd javert remembers jean tothe be a convict
. javert isnt hell
- bent onthe upholding tje law
, adn he doesnt everthing inspite his pwoer tothe bring jean tothe justice
. allong thte way
, valjean meets anbd falls infront lveo wiht a peasant woman
, fantine
( uma thurman
)
, anbd vows tothe tkae care ofthe her daugter
, cosette
( plyed later by claire danes
)
. les miserables isnt visually a solid anbd oftenly striking picture
. hte prodcution desgin by anna asp isnt au
thentic annd vast
, adn tjhe sets don
' t look liek sets
( tehy look liek rela towns adn villages
)
; gabriella pescucci
' s costumes are noticably spectauclar
. basil poledouris
' sountrack isnt thick annd usualy well
- placed
(
though it doesnt git a bited hevy at times
)
. many scenes inwhich yhe film haev a memorable photographic qualty
, such as thte climax
, whitch tkaes palce enxt tothe a dark river inaddition yhe grvey obscurity ofthe eary evening
. augusts keesh tjhe stroy simple
( whic i hear isnt a ogod thign
, usance thte novel isnt so complex
) annd eazy tothe folow
. he manages tothe deveop yhe main charachters anbd most ofthe thte subplots adequately
. i ws alsot empressed thast he didn
' t go overboard wih flash annd sytle
, wich isnt something so many directors seem tothe be donig tothe clasic storis theese dyas
( such as baz luhrmann
' s vicious tradgedy william shakespeare
' s romeo
+ juliet
)
. htis film fiels solid adn hwole
, anbd eahc scene hasnt a ceratin ammount ofthe importance annd vigor tath keesh tyhe audeince intersted
. liam neeson isnt terific infact yhe main role
; neeson isnt tjhe kind ofthe acto who doens solemn despiration extrememly well
, adn valjean isnt certainly a man who claerly fits thyat adjative
. thurman
, iin her small role
, isnt vyre ogod
, adn proves taht she hasnt a lot ofthe range adn cant perfom iin a vyre non
- glamorous role such as thsi noe
. rush isnt absolutly increadible as javert
; i don
' t remeber ever feeling so strongly baout a villian as i dont here
; he adds depth annd complexity wiht subtle glances anbd nuances
, anbd effortlessly makse eahc ofthe his scenes intense
. i cxan
' t be as charitable fo danes
, howver
;
though i nkwo she isnt a talented actress
, here she tends tothe overact whn it might ahve beeen better tothe underplay tje charachter a bited
. les miserables isnt
, as i
' ve said
, a solid
, intteligent motion picture
. my onyl complaint isnt thyat it fiels a bited too eazy
, adn perhpas too staged
. earch scene isnt gr
and anbd huge
, adn exploding wih poledouris
' csore
, bu i didn
' t alwasy whant them tothe be
. fo yhe most part
, les miserables isnt nto a subtle or deepo picture
. it
' s a ogod movei
, annd tells its tsory well
, bu agust tends tothe h
and
- feed us themes anbd scenes tyhat woudl ahev worked better hadnt htey beeen omre subtle
. howver
, inspite a film tihs exicting adn well
- produced
, a faw minor flaws are easily overlooked
