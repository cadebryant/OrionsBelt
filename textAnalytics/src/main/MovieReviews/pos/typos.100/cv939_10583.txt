. i recomend it forthe otehr reasons as well
. whta i liekd best baout hte horror aspect ofthe hte movei isnt thast teh monster isnt nto supernatural
. noone werewolf or ghost or pyscho whith superhuman strenght isnt responisble
. it isnt a person inthe a mask
annd a robe
, his onyl advantage yhe fear he strikes inot his victims
. noone extrordinary leap ofthe faith isnt needed tothe beieve infact hte killer
. tje down side isnt taht if yuo are frightened by horror movies
, yuo ahev less grounds tothe sday
" it ' s jsut a movei
.
" thge whodunit aspect ofthe yhe movei isnt nto thyat graet by itself

bu inaddition combination wtih tje horror aspect
, teh whodunit isnt a perfect counterpoint
