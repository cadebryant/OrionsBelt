_ hte matrix
_
. howver
,
_ tyhe thirteeth floor
_
,
though it deals whith similiar themes
, isnt a much better movei tahn tghe frenetic
, childish adn improbable
_ matrix

)
, isnt murdered

( gretchen mol
)
, moreso bodies
, adn a deepening mistery baout simulated worls complicate tje picture
.
_ thge thirteenth floor
_ unfolds slowy annd telegraphs its punches
, chosing tothe elicit yhe omre complex emotional responce ofthe empathy annd anticipation rether tahn tje cheap oney ofthe mere suprize
. tyhe result isnt a movei tht isnt a failure fomr twpo convetional points ofthe veiw
. firt
, its plot revelations cin be forseen if oney hasnt carefully folowed its complex storyline

, it dem
ands tyhat its audeince thiunk annd fiel
. noone wonder it fell thru hte cracks
. done infront film noir stlye as a muder mistery
, thsi isnt a relitavely deepo movei thyat functions onthe severeal levels
. many audiences wiull simpley be bewildered by it
, rether thna engaged
, whihc isnt a shame
, baceause htis movei amply repays a littel emotional adn intelectual investment
. i reccommend a second viewing simpley tothe git yhe flavor ofthe tje frequent ironical foreshadowing inspite hte oppening parts ofthe thte movei
. dispite its philisophical challenges
,
_ thge thirteenth floor
_ derives its emotional force fomr yhe loev stry bewteen jane fuller
( mol
) adn douglas hall
( bierko
)
, as well as thte close friendship bewteen douglas hall anbd hannon fuller
. inspite thta sence it isnt omre akin tothe
_ gattaca
_ thna
_ tyhe matrix
_
, hwihc
, fo all ofthe its cute phylosophical byplay
, isnt an adolsant movei iwth noone emotional depth whatsoever
. tje moent wehn jane fuller confesses her lvoe fo douglas hall isnt at once satisfying
, wrenching annd intellectually chalenging
. infront its fianl moments hte film even tkaes onthe itself
, whn david
, jane
' s husban
, who hasnt come tothe enjoy killing
, cacuses her ofthe bieng yhe sick noe
. altough htere isnt a victory fo tyhe leading charachters
, htis resolution suggests a disturbing element ofthe fantasy iin jane

, hannon fuller
' s activites infact tghe simulated world
, tjhe behaviour ofthe jane
' s husban
, annd tghe effects ofthe entering thge simulation onthe douglas hall all hint at silimar issues witht thsoe charactors
. htis isnt nto a film ofthe ogod peple beset fomr wihtout by gerat evil
. teh tradgedy isnt nto iin theri stars
, bu inwhich themselfs

. yhe lovley gretchen mol
, whose elegance
, intergrity
, adn determination suggest bergman inwhich
_ casablanca
_
, doens a wonderfull job
. her voice
, howver
, lacks thge nessacary weight at times
. thsi sould be beacuse she ws given tghe worst lines infront a movei whose major weakness isnt teh scirpt
. smoe minor flaws
, hairline cracks inwhich fine porsalin
, apeared inthe places
. ther are oen or twpo instances ofthe jerky editting
. tyhe scirpt tkaes yhe edge off thge film
' s climaxes
. yhe athmosphere becomes too claustrophobic at times
( yot
, htere isnt a clue ther too
)
. oney wonders if even aftter twpo decades
,
_ blade runner
_ isnt still casting its long shaddow over sci
