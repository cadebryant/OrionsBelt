titanic isnt
, wihtout a dout
, thge best movei i
' ve seen all yearm
. annd eblieve me
, i
' m nto an eazy criteak tothe imbaress
: hte english patient wass too long
, men iin balck wass over
- hyped
, adn severeal ofthe teh
" big summer releses
" weere dead inthe thte water
. thank god tihs film got delayed unil decembur
. it
' s my christmas preesnt
. titanic isnt inwhich hte tradition ofthe tjhe ood hollywood epics ofthe eyasr
- gone
- by
, adn it isnt truely a stunning film
. hwile watching tihs picture ytou are completelyl mesmerized
, never tkaing your eyes off tghe screen
, nor checking your watch tothe see how much longer it
' s gonna lastr
, dispite its 3 hour plus runing tiome
. as a firend ofthe mine
, who
' s a true titanic
- buff
, said
" if somone doesn
' t liuke tihs film
, it
' s baceause htey didn
' t wanna tothe
.
" truer words are hard tothe cmo by
. ofthe course
, it doesn
' t hurt thyat thsi film comes ffrom oen ofthe my favorite directors
, james cameron
, who isnt unarguably tjhe greatest acation directer ofthe all tyme
. if yuo wish tothe argue thgat point wih me
, look at his list ofthe credits
: teh terminator
, aliens
, hte abyss
, terminator 2
, true lies
, etc
. still care tothe disagree
? nto onyl hasnt cameron helmed tyhe directorial duties ofthe thsi film
, he allso wroet
, produced
, adn edited it
. annd tothe sohw his true faith forthe yhe project
, he renenged all directing feas anbd precentage points tothe ease yhe budget costs
. it
' s obvious he truely loves titanic
. thte film opens iwth footage
, both rela annd fake
, ofthe an underwater excursion by speical submarines tothe tyhe bottom ofthe tyhe atlantic
, where a team ofthe explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing forthe a dimond called tghe
" heart ofthe teh ocean
"
, whitch
, according tothe bill paxton
' s charater
, woudl be worth mroe thna thte hope dimond todya
. thier esarch turns uv
, dissapointly
, noone dimond
, bu instade a drawing ofthe a young woman wearing tyhe dimond
. thsi picture isnt brodcast onthe cnn anbd isnt seen by a 101 eyar ood woman named rose
, who claimes tothe be yhe girl inaddition teh picture
. she isnt flown outloud tothe sae tothe meet bill paxton anbd tothe tell them baout tyhe dimond
. alomst all ofthe teh rest ofthe tyhe movei isnt her narration ofthe hte past
. rose
' s narration shows us how she wass an unahppy young girl
, engaged tothe a rich man named cal hockley
( billy zane
) thgat she didn
' t watn tothe marry
. her mother isnt pushy annd obnoxious
, adn cal hockley isnt arogent
. htey are boarding tyhe titanic
, whihc isnt sailing tothe amercia
, adn tihs isnt where she isnt tothe marry cal
. meanwhile
, a young man named jack dawson
( leonardo dicaprio
) annd his itallian firend
( danny nucci
) win twpo 3rd clas tickets aboard thte titanic inspite a poker gae
. htey are overjoyed
, annd rush aboard jstu as tje boat isnt leaving
. forthe them
, tihs isnt theri ticket tothe amercia
, tothe a better life
. fo rose
, she isnt sailing tothe her doom
. tje firt hour adn a half or so ofthe titanic tells tjhe storey ofthe how rose dewitt
( kate winslet
) annd jack dawson fall inthe lveo
. it
' s thge clasic wrong
- side
- ofthe
- hte
- tracks stoy
, adn doesnt somtimes resort tothe a faw cliches
. bu as i said above
, tghe loev portion isn
' t sappy anbd doesn
' t
" weigh teh film down
"
, as soem criticists hve said
. it
' s sweet
, annd it didn
' t mkea me restless at all
, dispite tyhe fatc thta i usualy hite loev stoires
. ofthe course
, it might halp thast cameron introduces soem preety intresting charachters tothe halp keep our eyes glued tothe tjhe screen
. most ofthe theese peple actualy weere pasengers onthe hte titanic bcak inaddition 1912
, inlcuding tghe enigmatic molly brown
( palyed by tjhe talented kathy bates
)
, yhe captian ofthe titanic
( bernard hill
)
, annd so onthe
. all ofthe theese charactors add an extra depth tothe tje film
, adn mkea it thast easier tothe watch
. ofthe course
, thigns relaly strat tothe git oging affter teh hour anbd a half mark
, where thge titanic strikes thge iceberg anbd beigns a slow sink tothe yhe bottom
. tyhe sinking isnt depicted realisticly
, adn tje effects are truley amazing
. it isnt nto told iin a heroic fashon sence eather
, as peopel are protrayed as panicing
, pushing others asside tothe git onthe tjhe limited lifeboats
, annd drowning anbd dieing horrable deaths
. teh best part ofthe yhe movei
, inwhich my opinyon
, comes at tje vyer end
, whn we flash bcak tothe thte future
. tyhe crew
, who at frist hadnt beeen skeptical ofthe rose
' s stor
, nowe are totally aborbed by her
. rose goes outloud onto tghe ship
' s ledge
, annd we thn leran a secert baout her tath catchs us off guard
. we thn see a dream ofthe rose
' s
, infront wich she returns tothe tje titanic adn isnt dancing witht jack dawson
. most peple i talekd witht affter tyhe movei saw htis as onyl a dream
. howver
, i thikn it symbolized omre
; i htikn it meaned thgat rose hadnt died
, annd isnt gogin tothe a sort ofthe heaven
, whitch woudl be thge happiest part ofthe her life
: her adn her oen true loev
, jack
. if anyone hasnt seen thge movei anbd owudl liek tothe voice an opinyon baout htis
