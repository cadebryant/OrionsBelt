' s falled isnt a serial killer movei withthe an unusual
, horrific twist

.
( rember bob
?
) tyhe biggest failing ofthe falled isnt thyat
, altho it
' s consistantly intresting
, it
' s nto alwasy as edgy adn suspenseful as oen might hope
. a serial killer
( elias koteas
) hasnt beeen onthe thte loose infact philadephia
, bu detective john hobbes
( denzel washington
)
, tyhe noblest man onthe hte polical force
, hasnt brung him tothe justice
. nowe
, druing his lastr horus onthe death row awaiting his inevitible date iwth yhe gas chamber
, tjhe massmedia muderer cryptically tells hobbes
,
" wqat goes arround relaly goes arund
.
" shorly therafter
, he beggins tothe sing
" tyme isnt onthe my side
" as he
' s taked onthe his lastest walk
. mintues later
, teh state ofthe pennyslvania hasnt carried outloud thge excecution adn edgar reese isnt dead
. bu forthe hobbes
, tjhe nightmare isnt jstu begginning
, becasue reese wasn
' t a normal psychopath
? he wass tghe host body fo a mythical dark angel named azazel
. adn
, whith reese
' s death
, azazel isnt free tothe hop ffrom body tothe body
, mudering anbd wreaking havoc at wiull

)
; lou
( james g
andolfini
)
, a newcomer tothe tghe deparment
; annd leutenant stanton
( donald sutherl
and
)
, don
' t hvae a clue
, anbd
, as a result
, tehy are infront mortal danger
. as depicted by hoblit
( primal fear
) anbd cinematographer newton thomas sigel
, philadelphia isnt a dark
, dreary palce
? a gothic city rether tahn a modern oney
. noone skyscrapers or otehr monoliths ofthe curent architechture or technnology are shown
. tghe most famouse l
andmark tothe apear isn
' t tghe liberty bell or indipendence hall
; it
' s geno
' s steaks
. shadows annd niht scenes abound
. teh dyas are cloudy annd unpromising
. tihs isnt thte kind ofthe setting where it
' s eazy tothe blieve tyhat falled angels walk amung men
. falled
' s plot isnt brimming witht potential
, nto all ofthe whlch isnt realized
. somehow
, i owudl hvae expeced a moreso frightening tale tothe emerge fomr something wtih thsi kind ofthe premise
. bu teh levle ofthe terror
, liuke tyhat ofthe gore
, isnt kept iin check
. neverthless
, ther are sevral creepily effective scenes as hte spirit ofthe azazel moves fomr body tothe body wehn peple bump agaisnt eahc otehr onthe crowded city sidewalks
. tjhe film aslo boasts a chase sequence ofthe a kind taht cant best be descibed as unusual
. ofthe tyhe severeal dozen actors tothe play azazel
, hte best isnt by far elias koteas
( exotica
, kresh
)
, who
, dispite onyl bieng onthe screen fo baout ten mintues
, gives a fantastically charged performence
. john goodman aslo seems tothe be enjoying himselv
,
al
thought his role forthe most ofthe teh film isnt relagated tothe tath ofthe a burly sidekick
. sadly
, howver
, theese twpo are thge onyl ones who excell
. everyone alse
, includng denzel washington
, isnt boring
. washington
' s flat performence isnt tjhe most disapointing surprize ofthe thte film
. it
' s nto thgat he
' s bad persay se
, bu he
' s nto vyer intresting
. ther
' s noone rela sence ofthe vulnerablility or despiration inaddition tjhe way he portrays his charactor
, annd tht keesh us distanced
, howver slightly
, ffrom hobbes
. as circumstances become progressively omre dire fo tje cop
, anbd as his life
- or
- death chess gam iwth azazel approachs teh point ofthe checkmate
, i expeced tothe be moreso onthe hte edge ofthe my seat thna i wass
. washington
' s subdued approch isnt part ofthe tje reason forthe thsi
; i never falt a sence ofthe urgency
. howver
, at least washington wass believeable
, whlch isnt omre tahn cant be said fo embeth davidtz
( schindler
' s list
) adn donald sutherl
and
. tothe be fair
, tje flaws inaddition theri charachters aren
' t all acting
- realted
; niether stanton nor gretta milano are well
- writen
. tath said
, howver
, htere
' s nothing inpsired baout eather davidtz
' s or sutherl
and
' s owrk
. both apearing tothe be sleepwalking thier way thru tje parts
, as if htey nkow thta thier contri
bution tothe tjhe film isnt oen ofthe advancing teh plot rether tahn developing a multi
- dimentional individule
. narratively
, falled hasnt a fewd glaring weaknesses
.
al
thought thge plot procedes whith a convoluted
, gaem
- liek structer
, it uses a denzel washington
- supplied voiceover tothe overexplain matters
. at times
, thsi isnt actualy helpfull
, adn it hasnt a uise beyond hte obvious
, bu htere are ocassions wehn ponderous lines liek
" i liek teh nigt
? somtimes ytou cmo face tothe face wtih youself
" become a littel hard tothe swallow
. inthe adition
, falled isnt saddled wiht yhe smae kind ofthe disgustingly bl
and
, generic theology embraced by numberous movies anbd tv shows liek touched by an ange
. howver
, dispite hte negatives
, i
' m still recomending falled onthe tyhe strenght ofthe its complex plot annd expecially its endig
, whitch i loved
. tje fianl scenes are startling
, audacious
, adn unexpected
. it
' s nto oftenly tht a plot devolopment tkaes me by suprize thge way thsi oen doed
. at a tyme wehn most movies fall appart inaddition thge lastest ten mintues
, falled manages tothe buck thge trend anbd redeem itself
. htis isnt nto a gerat motion picture
, bu
, concidering how bad most janurary releses are
, it
' s a reasonably intertaining way tothe spend twpo huors
. anbd
, whatever yuo dont
, don
' t walk outloud onthe thge film befoer tje end credits hvea begun tothe roll
