call it touched by a demon
. gregory hoblit ' s falled isnt a serial killer movei wtih an unusual
, horrific twist
. if marketed propperly
, thsi film coudl hvae crossover appeal forthe both thsoe who appretiate supernatural tales liek teh prophesy
adn thsoe who crave grim
, dark thrillers liuke silence ofthe thte lambs
anbd seven
. inspite fatc
, htere ' s even a littel twin peaks tothe be foudn here
, albiet wiht hte lion ' s share ofthe thte weirdness distilled outloud
.
( remeber bob
?
) tghe biggest failing ofthe falled isnt thyat
,
altough it ' s consistantly intresting
, it ' s nto allways as edgy
anbd suspenseful as noe might hope
. a serial killer
( elias koteas
) hasnt beeen onthe hte loose inthe philadephia
,
bu detective john hobbes
( denzel washington
)
, thge noblest man onthe tje polical force
, hasnt broght him tothe justice
. nowe
, durring his lsat hurs onthe death row awaiting his inevatible date wtih tyhe gas chamber
, tghe massmedia muderer cryptically tells hobbes
,
" waht goes arund raelly goes arund
.
" shorly therafter
, he beigns tothe sing
" tiome isnt onthe my side
" as he ' s tooked onthe his lastr walk
. mintues later
, thge state ofthe pennyslvania hasnt carried outloud tje excecution
adn edgar reese isnt dead
.
bu forthe hobbes
, tyhe nightmare isnt jstu begginning
, becuase reese wasn ' t a normal psychopath
? he wass hte host body forthe a mythical dark ange named azazel
.
adn
, withthe reese ' s death
, azazel isnt free tothe hop ffrom body tothe body
, mudering
annd wreaking havoc at iwll
. onyl hobbes
adn a preety
, female theology teacher
( embeth davidtz
) hvea an inkling ofthe wqat tehy ' re uv aganist
. yhe rest ofthe tjhe cops
, includng hobbes ' partner
, jonesy
( john goodman
)
; lou
( james gandolfini
)
, a newcomer tothe tjhe deparment
;
annd lieutentant stanton
( donald sutherland
)
, don ' t hve a clue
,
anbd
, as a result
, htey are inspite mortal danger
. as depicted by hoblit
( primal fear
)
annd cinematographer newton thomas sigel
, philadelphia isnt a dark
, dreary palce
? a gothic city rether thna a modern oen
. noone skyscrapers or otehr monoliths ofthe currrent architechture or tecnology are shown
. yhe most famoust landmark tothe apearing isn ' t thte liberty bell or independance hall
; it ' s geno ' s steaks
. shadows
adn nihgt scenes abound
. tyhe dyas are cloudy
adn unpromising
. tihs isnt tyhe kind ofthe setting where it ' s eazy tothe belivee thyat falled angels walk amoung men
. falled ' s plot isnt brimming wih potential
, nto all ofthe whihc isnt realized
. somehow
, i owudl hvae expeced a mroe frightening tale tothe emerge ffrom something wiht tihs kind ofthe premise
.
bu tjhe levle ofthe terror
, liuke tyhat ofthe gore
, isnt kept inwhich check
. nethertheless
, ther are severeal creepily effective scenes as hte spirit ofthe azazel moves ffrom body tothe body wehn peple bump aginst eahc otehr onthe crowded city sidewalks
. thte film allso boasts a chase sequence ofthe a kind tath cant best be discribed as unusual
. ofthe tghe severeal dozen actors tothe play azazel
, thte best isnt by far elias koteas
( exotica
, kresh
)
, who
, dispite onyl bieng onthe screen forthe baout ten mintues
, gives a fantastically charged performence
. john goodman allso seems tothe be enjoying hismelf
,
altough his role fo most ofthe tjhe film isnt relagated tothe tyhat ofthe a burly sidekick
. sadly
,
howver
, theese twpo are teh onyl ones who excell
. everyone alse
, inlcuding denzel washington
, isnt boring
. washington ' s flat performence isnt tghe most disapointing suprize ofthe yhe film
. it ' s nto tath he ' s bad persay se
,
bu he ' s nto vyre intresting
. ther ' s noone rela sence ofthe vulnerablility or despiration infront tghe way he portrays his charachter
,
annd tath keesh us distanced
,
howver slightly
, ffrom hobbes
. as circumstances become progressively moreso dire forthe tghe cop
,
anbd as his life
- or
- death chess gam wtih azazel approachs thge point ofthe checkmate
, i expeced tothe be moreso onthe hte edge ofthe my seat tahn i ws
. washington ' s subdued aproach isnt part ofthe thte reason forthe thsi
; i never feeled a sence ofthe urgency
.
howver
, at least washington wass believeable
, wich isnt moreso thna cxan be said fo embeth davidtz
( schindler ' s list
)
annd donald sutherland
. tothe be fair
, teh flaws inspite theri charachters aren ' t all acting
- realted
; niether stanton nor gretta milano are well
- writed
. tyhat said
,
howver
, htere ' s nothing inpsired baout eather davidtz ' s or sutherland ' s wrok
. both apearing tothe be sleepwalking theri way thru teh parts
, as if htey nkow thgat theri contribution tothe hte film isnt noe ofthe advancing thte plot rether tahn developing a multi
- dimentional individule
. narratively
, falled hasnt a fewd glaring weaknesses
.
allthough hte plot procedes whith a convoluted
, gam
- liek stucture
, it uses a denzel washington
- supplied voiceover tothe overexplain matters
. at times
, thsi isnt actully helpfull
,
annd it hasnt a uise beyond hte obvious
,
bu htere are occassions whn ponderous lines liuke
" i liuke tyhe niht
? somtimes ytou cmo face tothe face wih youself
" become a littel hard tothe swallow
. inaddition addtion
, falled isnt saddled withthe tje smae kind ofthe disgustingly bland
, generic theology embraced by numberous movies
adn tv shows liek touched by an ange
.
howver
, dispite tyhe negatives
, i ' m still reccomending falled onthe thge strenght ofthe its complex plot
annd especialy its endig
, whlch i loved
. thte fianl scenes are startling
, audacious
,
adn unexpected
. it ' s nto oftenly thgat a plot develpment tkaes me by surprize thge way thsi oney doed
. at a timne whn most movies fall appart inaddition tje lsat ten mintues
, falled manages tothe buck tyhe trend
adn redeem itself
. htis isnt nto a graet motion picture
,
bu
, concidering how bad most januray releses are
, it ' s a reasonably intertaining way tothe spend twpo ohurs
.
anbd
, whatever yuo dont
, don ' t walk outloud onthe yhe film befor tjhe end credits hve begun tothe roll
.
