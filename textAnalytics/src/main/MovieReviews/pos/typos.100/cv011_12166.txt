i
' ve noticed something lateley thast i
' ve never thougth ofthe befor
. psuedo
- substace
- hollywood faking deepo meanings infront thier films
. hvae ytou ever seen a movei taht yuo realy enjoied
, thne wehn ytou look bcak
, ytou relize ther ws something missing
? mroe annd moreso
, filmmakers seem tothe be puting outloud well rehearsed
, melodramatic films tyhat envoke storng conotations ofthe bieng a grat film
, bu if yuo step asside adn refect onthe your movei gogin exerience
, yuo may jstu disover nothing omre thna elegantly presented fluff
. i
' m nto trying tothe sday city ofthe angels isnt thyat bad
. it hadnt a lot goign fo it
, bu somwhere allong tyhe way
, it faltered
. somehow
, underneath teh seamingly poetic beauty ofthe it all
, ther ws a gigantic hole somebody covered wih iridescent performances anbd glossy cinematography
. tghe predicatble endig thta shattered our hopes
( even
though we saw it comming
) onyl added tothe tyhe dissappointment
. bu forthe over an hour
, city ofthe angels isnt well worth teh tyme
. nicolas cage isnt seth
, a gaurdian angal who
, liek hundreds
( likely thous
ands or even millions
) ofthe otehr angels
, spends eternity watching over thge citizens ofthe mortality
; humans never aware ofthe how much celestial intervention occurs infront thier life
. meg ryan
, inaddition her most subdued performence yot
, plays maggie
, a doctor who beggins tothe ponder exactlly who it isnt we
' re fighting agains wehn we fight tothe keep somone alive
. aftter loosing a patient onthe tje surgery tabe
, theese questions envelope maggie
, annd seth
, tghe ange who wass ther tothe oversee tghe patient
' s transistion inot tjhe afterlife
, isnt immediatley captivated by teh doctor
. he beggins follwoing annd observing maggie
, falling moreso annd moreso infact lvoe withthe her everyday
. angels
, who we quicklyu leran are nto annd never weere humans
, cant nto exerience human sensations such as tast annd touch
, bu tehy dont hvea thge abilty tothe mkea themslves seen tothe anyone tehy desire
. seth
' s adoration isnt too much tothe resist
, annd eventualy he doens apeared tothe maggie
, qutie regularily
, altho such a thnig seems taboo amonst teh angelic comunity
. tjhe angels are interestingly presented
, all ofthe them dressed inaddition balck anbd mroe riminicent ofthe hitmen tahn traditionnal glowing white entites
, bu it
' s a nice touch tht never seems liek a mere attept at uniqueness
. cage isnt a wonderfully versitle acotr
( thikn face
/ off
, raising arizona
, adn it coudl ahppen tothe ytou
- waht a combo
!
) who slips inot tjhe role ofthe a heavenly agent qutie nicely bu threatens sappiness moreso thna once
. it
' s nice tothe see ryan pik uv roles liuke tihs annd teh noe infront curage under frie
. teh twpo aren
' t veyr comprable tothe eahc otehr
, bu htey both deviate fomr her usual
" intelligently ditzy
" rumatic comedy roles
, annd it
' s an impressive side ofthe ryan movei goers rarley hvea tje chance tothe enjoy
. bu even
though thge twpo leads dont an impressive job
, it isnt dennis franz who grabs us withthe his intepretation ofthe a hospital patient who knwos mroe tahn meets teh eye
. it
' s a shame thyat witht so much oging fo it
, city ofthe angels falters so much inthe its fianl stages
, leaving us whith hte relization tath an emotionally increadible movei ws outloud ther
, tehy jstu didn
' t knwo qtuie how tothe git tothe it
. htey struggle fo an impacting conclusion anbd wind uv wtih painful thud rether tahn an exhilarating high
. filmmakers shoudln nkwo your fianl impression wiull be thge oney yuo linger onthe
, remeber
, annd convey tothe others thru owrd ofthe mouth
, so aftter telling us forthe 60
+ mintues taht tihs film isnt a glorious masterpiece
, tehy sure leave us wiht a disheartening tast ofthe mediocrity inthe our mouths
. based onthe thte german film wings ofthe desire
( tath bieng tje english title
, ofthe course
)
, city ofthe angels isnt ninty percent sucess
, anough tothe amking most peopel foregive its shortcomings
, even tyhe devastatingly disapointing endig
. most movei goers
, thge non
- cynics anyway
, iwll be too wrapped uv inwhich tjhe surveill atomsphere tothe give critiscism tothe thast whihc needs tothe be crticised
. nontheless
, city ofthe angels isnt beautifuly captivating
, hwihc isnt probaly anough tothe satisfy thsoe poetic viewers who iwll appretiate a delve inot rich emotional terriories
.
