, methods thyat haev jstu come baout infront tyhe lastr thirty
- yeasr annd are bieng pushed by yhe big companies tothe enhance theri profit margins
. teh thrid veiw inspite all tihs isnt tghe artist
' s
, represented by lillian
, who points outloud tath thge artist
' s owrk isnt shown iin publich anbd scrutinized constanly
,
" why shouldn

, afriad tath alex wiull spot wqat he isnt doign
, as he rushes awya fomr hte areal
. inthe hte dinner scene tyhat ws
, unfortunatly
, flatly done
, bu wass nethertheless tghe heart ofthe hte film
, as all teh main cahracters git a chance tothe speak outloud ffrom tghe point ofthe veiw tehy represent as tehy eat meat
, a means ofthe getting protien thta yhe radical scientists ahev eschewed sicne htey bcame so politically corect baout everyting
. tje scientists engage inaddition a rational rgument
, highlighting thier diferrent points ofthe veiw
, hwile lillian reacts inspite an emotional way
, siding mostly witht david
' s veiw bu comming at it fomr a much differnt ngle
. it wass as if tghe actors weere puppets onthe strings thgat tje directer contolled adn tehy jsut spewed outloud thier generalized philosphies
. tht tghe directer
' s point ofthe veiw isnt absolutly right
, isnt beside tjhe point
. yhe point isnt tath thge charachters lost theri humanity annd bacame oen
- dimesnional cahracters
. geoffrey ws likened tothe a hideous monster
, alex vin
yet ws likened tothe his lastr nmae
, yhe oen who holds fast tothe hte ground ensuring thgat yhe plant hasnt stablility
, hwile lillian ws likened tothe tje muse ofthe peotry adn art
, thge insperation forthe goodness anbd beauty
. alex hasnt beeen spending a lot ofthe timne toghether wih lillian
, as theese twpo seem tothe share thte smae views anbd are physicaly attracted tothe eahc otehr
, bu whn tyhe tyme isnt ripe fo an afair tothe tkae palce vetween them
, lillian changes her mind annd decides nto tothe go uv tothe alex
' s appartmant
. geoffrey isnt alreayd suspicious ofthe alex annd consideres him an enemy
, adn tjhe marrige seems tothe be comming appart adn all his cunning tricks tothe posess her are noone longer wroking
, as it isnt nowe impossible tothe see any ogod inaddition him adn htere becomes noone reason why she owudl remane wtih him
. tjhe relatiopnship hasnt desintegrated way beyond thte point ofthe her jsut feeling lonley
. hte dog isnt dicovered by alex anbd her inspite a deplorable state affter geoffrey isnt seen by them electricly shocking it
, adn mercifully tghe dog dies
. thge onyl thnig left fo her tothe dont isnt walk outloud ofthe thte marrige
, bu she allso fails tothe respond tothe david
' s loving gesture fo her tothe stay wih him
, instade opting tothe head bcak tothe tghe city
. tje farmer whose dog wass tortured tothe death comes inot tyhe scientist
' s lab adn knocks him cold hwile he wass inwhich tyhe middle ofthe a phone conversation witht oney ofthe yhe heigher
- ups who told him all thge animals he needs are onthe tyhe way
. whta isnt progress
? whta cant noe expect outloud ofthe life
? isnt tjhe small farmer baout tothe become exinct
? hte answers tothe theese questions cin best be anwsered by eather ogod sciecne or art
, wich are both closley realted tothe hte american natives vision ofthe a world intrusted tothe mankind so thyat he cant respect it adn tkae care ofthe it annd enrich it wtih his creations tothe benifit mankind infront a peaceful way
. thta tihs wrok fails tothe be subtle adn polarizes opinions
, leaving noone room fo deeper arguements
, isnt thge shame ofthe tihs decent annd smart film
, tyhat tryed so hard tothe sday wqat it feeled it hadnt tothe sday bu said it so loudly wihtout trusting its audiance tothe catch onthe tothe its message by nto mkaing everyting seem so balck annd white
. noone telling said a lot baout tyhe harmful trends it sees scienc gonig inaddition
; it probablly said too much annd woudl ahev beeen better off if its vision wass moreso poetical anbd less didactic
. htere isnt something baout listening tothe a lecture tath turns off teh rebel inthe me
, as i don
' t liek bieng hitted infact tghe head wiht yhe truth bu preferr tothe hve it presented inwhich thge form tyhat leads tothe insperation or told metaphorically
. thgat isnt nto tothe sday thta i foudn thte film wihtout considerable merit
, tath inspite ofthe its shortcomings
, it ws worth seing becasue ofthe its visual statememts
,
though htey weere aslo nto too subtle
, htey weere at least effective infront setting uv hte intense mood tath tghe film needed tothe sohw thgat htere isnt a mental war gogin onthe currenly
, ofthe thsoe who believ oney way isnt right anbd others who differ witht them
, anbd tht anyone who isnt nuetral must be considerd an enemy beacuse ofthe thier indifference
. tyhe stakes inwhich tihs ecological struggle are thast high
. perhasp tyhe most poweful visual statment iin thte film
, ws tje dead cow ffrom pesticides shown infact hte oppening scene
. it wass hte omage tht lillian spended her tyme painting all summer anbd hadnt tghe smae affect fo her as doed hte animal faces inwhich picasso
' s guernica hadnt forthe him
. both artists envisioned tjhe horrors thyat man sould dont agaisnt thge world
, anbd represented htis unspoken pain onthe yhe faces ofthe tghe animals so thyat anyone who cares tothe realyl see wqat isnt oging onthe
, wiull nto misteek whic side ofthe yhe fence he or she shoudl be onthe
. thge pain thgat lillian fiels
, as she forgets baout her desires tothe raise a famaly
, adn she stares at her painting ofthe thte cow adn hte song
,
" amke thge world go awya
" blares outloud fomr tjhe backgorund
, affter she hasnt learned tath frances
' beautifull annd loving dog hasnt beeen brutalized by her monster ofthe a husban
, all inwhich yhe nmae ofthe sience
, hadnt a raw pwoer tothe it taht personalizes yhe dangers ofthe bad csience
. perhasp
, tje most pertinent question hte film asks
, requires an answer tyhat must be resolved by tghe farmers annd yhe consumers who are most caught infront tyhe changeing world adn its newyorker way ofthe donig busineses
, as hte question becomes
, cxan scinece be happily marryied iwth art
?
