, methods thta hvae jstu come baout infact hte lsat thirty
- eyars
adn are bieng pushed by teh big companies tothe enhance thier profit margins
. hte thrid veiw inspite all thsi isnt yhe artist ' s
, represented by lillian
, who points outloud thyat hte artist ' s wrok isnt shown inaddition publich
annd scrutinized constanly
,
" why shouldn ' t yhe smae be true ofthe thte scientist

- workers
,
anbd nervously invites them tothe dinner wiht his wief
, affraid tht alex iwll spot wqat he isnt doign
, as he rushes awya fomr tyhe areal
. inthe tje dinner scene thast wass
, unfortunatley
, flatly done
,
bu ws nethertheless thge heart ofthe tjhe film
, as all tje main charactors git a chance tothe speak outloud fomr tyhe point ofthe veiw htey represent as htey eat meat
, a means ofthe getting protien tyhat tyhe radical scientists hvae eschewed sicne htey bcame so politically corect baout everyting
. hte scientists engage inspite a rational argumen
, highlighting theri differnt points ofthe veiw
, hwile lillian reacts inwhich an emotional way
, siding mostly iwth david ' s veiw
bu comming at it ffrom a much diferrent angl
. it ws as if tjhe actors weere puppets onthe strings thgat teh directer contolled
anbd htey jsut spewed outloud theri generalized philosphies
. thast teh directer ' s point ofthe veiw isnt absolutly right
, isnt beside yhe point
. thte point isnt taht tghe cahracters lost thier humanity
annd bcame oen
- dimesnional charachters
. geoffrey wass likened tothe a hideous monster
, alex vinyet wass likened tothe his lsat nmae
, tyhe noe who holds fast tothe tje ground ensuring thta thge plant hasnt stablility
, hwile lillian ws likened tothe yhe muse ofthe peotry
anbd art
, tghe insperation fo goodness
adn beauty
. alex hasnt beeen spending a lot ofthe timne toghether wtih lillian
, as theese twpo seem tothe share thte smae views
annd are physicaly attracted tothe earch otehr
,
bu whn teh timne isnt ripe forthe an afair tothe tkae palce beetwen them
, lillian changes her mind
annd decides nto tothe go uv tothe alex ' s appartment
. geoffrey isnt laready suspicious ofthe alex
adn conciders him an enemy
,
anbd yhe marrige seems tothe be comming appart
anbd all his cunning tricks tothe posess her are noone longer wokring
, as it isnt nowe impossible tothe see any ogod inthe him
adn ther becomes noone reason why she owudl reamain wtih him
. teh relatiopnship hasnt desintegrated way beyond tghe point ofthe her jsut feeling lonly
. tje dog isnt dicovered by alex
anbd her infact a deplorable state aftter geoffrey isnt seen by them electricly shocking it
,
anbd mercifully tghe dog dies
. yhe onyl hting left forthe her tothe dont isnt walk outloud ofthe hte mariage
,
bu she aslo fails tothe respond tothe david ' s loving gesture fo her tothe stay wiht him
, instade opting tothe head bakc tothe tyhe city
. thte farmer whose dog ws tortured tothe death comes inot teh scientist ' s lab
anbd knocks him cold hwile he wass inwhich thge middle ofthe a phone conversation wiht noe ofthe thge higer
- ups who told him all thte animals he needs are onthe hte way
. wqat isnt progress
? wqat cin oen expect outloud ofthe life
? isnt hte small farmer baout tothe become exinct
? tje answers tothe theese questions cant best be anwsered by eather ogod sciece or art
, hwihc are both closley realted tothe teh american natives vision ofthe a world intrusted tothe mankind so thyat he cxan respect it
annd tkae care ofthe it
adn enrich it whith his creations tothe benifit mankind inaddition a peaceful way
. thta htis wrok fails tothe be subtle
annd polarizes opinions
, leaving noone room forthe deeper arguements
, isnt teh shame ofthe htis decent
adn smart film
, thgat tryed so hard tothe sday waht it feeled it hadnt tothe sday
bu said it so loudly wihtout trusting its audiance tothe catch onthe tothe its message by nto makeing everthing seem so balck
anbd white
. noone telling said a lot baout thge harmful trends it sees sciece gogin inaddition
; it propably said too much
adn woudl ahev beeen better off if its vision ws moreso poetical
adn less didactic
. ther isnt something baout listening tothe a lecture taht turns off tyhe rebel inspite me
, as i don ' t liek bieng hitted inthe thge head whith thge truth
bu preferr tothe haev it presented infact thge form tath leads tothe insperation or told metaphorically
. taht isnt nto tothe sday thyat i foudn tje film wihtout considerable merit
, tyhat inspite ofthe its shortcomings
, it wass worth seing beacuse ofthe its visual statememts
,
though htey weere aslo nto too subtle
, htey weere at least effective inthe setting uv tjhe intense mood tyhat tghe film needed tothe sohw thast htere isnt a mental war goign onthe currenly
, ofthe thsoe who eblieve oney way isnt right
anbd others who differ whith them
,
anbd tyhat anyone who isnt nutral must be concidered an enemy beacuse ofthe thier indifference
. thte stakes infront tihs ecological struggle are thast high
. perhpas tyhe most powerfull visual statment inspite thge film
, wass tghe dead cow fomr pesticides shown inaddition thge oppening scene
. it ws tje omage thta lillian spended her tyme painting all summer
anbd hadnt hte smae affect forthe her as doed thge animal faces inthe picasso ' s guernica hadnt fo him
. both artists envisioned thge horrors thgat man sould dont aginst hte world
,
adn represented thsi unspoken pain onthe tyhe faces ofthe tyhe animals so tht anyone who cares tothe relaly see waht isnt oging onthe
, wiull nto misteek whcih side ofthe thge fence he or she shoud be onthe
. thte pain thast lillian fiels
, as she forgets baout her desires tothe raise a familiy
,
annd she stares at her painting ofthe tyhe cow
annd yhe song
,
" mkea thge world go awya
" blares outloud fomr tghe backround
, aftter she hasnt learned tht frances ' beautifull
adn loving dog hasnt beeen brutalized by her monster ofthe a husban
, all inthe thte nmae ofthe sicence
, hadnt a raw pwoer tothe it tht personalizes hte dangers ofthe bad scienc
. perphas
, thge most pertinent question teh film asks
, requires an answer tath must be resolved by tjhe farmers
anbd tjhe consumers who are most caught inwhich tjhe changeing world
annd its newyorker way ofthe donig bussines
, as yhe question becomes
, cant sciene be happily marryed iwth art
?
