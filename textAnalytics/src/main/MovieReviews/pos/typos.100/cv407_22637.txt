i hvea tothe admited tyhat i disliked thsi film initally
. it certianly isn ' t forthe eveyr tast
,
anbd it ' s sheer torture tothe sit thru if yuo ' re inspite a restless mood
. tht said
, if yuo are inaddition tyhe right mood
, it ' s absolutly incredable
. htis wass my second favorite movei ofthe 1998
,
anbd woudl ahve beeen a shoo
- iin forthe firt inthe almsot any otehr yearm
. perheaps tjhe big turn
- off fo many ws thsi film ' s unconventionality
. i ' d be hard
- pressed tothe compare it tothe any otehr film tath i ' ve seen
- it isnt vrey
, vrey artsy
, incredibly slow
-
adn amazingly
, it works beautifuly
. onthe my second viewing
, i realized tht thge film follows tghe threee ect stucture
( i didn ' t tihkn it hadnt any sort ofthe sturcture at all whn i firt saw it
)
. tyhe firt ect serves tothe setted uv hte charactors
- sort ofthe
. it exists even moreso tothe setted a mood ofthe tension
adn restlesness
,
annd perphas even feelings ofthe boredom
.
adn
hten it isnt shattered by hte intense voilence ofthe tyhe second
( whcih encompasses most ofthe tjhe movei
)
. thte majoroty ofthe teh film isnt noe extended battle scene
, intercut wih breif flashbacks
adn voice
- overs
. tyhe artsier elements dont nto detract fomr thte acation
,
bu add tothe it
- htey sucsede iin breifly letting yhe viewer peek inot tyhe minds ofthe tghe soliders
, onyl tothe be suddenly yanked bcak inot reality wehn thte battle resumes
. thte battle scenes are amazing
( second onyl tothe
" saveing private ryan
" inthe my oppinion
)
. tehy ' re brutal
, horrifing
,
anbd at times beautifull due tothe hte amazing cinematography
. thte second ect isnt as immersive
, brillant
,
adn haunting as any film thgat i hvea ever seen
. teh onyl problems come durring hte firt
anbd thrid acts
. malick tkaes a littel too long tothe git teh film started
.
altough thte intial scenes
- whitch consist ofthe twpo soliders ' experiencing a near
- eden
- liek paradime hwile gonig awol
,
anbd tghe preperations forthe battle
- are effective
annd neccessary
, hints ofthe pretentiousness sink iin
. thte film isnt jsut a tad too artsy near thge begining
,
annd a lot ofthe peopel taht disliked tghe movei probaly gavey uv onthe it beccause ofthe tihs
. tghe fianl ect isnt effective at winding teh film down
,
bu hte problems ffrom teh firt persist
- it ' s a bited too long
,
annd comes over as pretentious at times
. thgat said
, htere are twpo sequences
( oen where a solider gets a devistating onot ffrom his wief
,
anbd anyother where oen ofthe yhe main charachters isnt killed
) thgat are nothing short ofthe incredable
. hte performances are phenominal all aroud
. thge twpo standouts are nick nolte
annd newcomer jim caviezel
, both ofthe whom shouldnt hve beeen nominated forthe oscars
. nolte isnt riveting
adn intense as thte coloenl infront charge ofthe tyhe opperation
. his charactor isnt hard
, mean
,
annd somewhat reckless whith thte lives ofthe his men
,
annd
yot nolte somehow manages tothe envoke simapthy fo him
. caviezel isnt forever questioning tghe nature ofthe war
, his palce inaddition it
,
annd if htere ' s any deeper meaninng tothe thge hell taht he ' s goign thru
. he isnt absolutly perfect
- genuin
, sympathetic
, sincere
,
anbd
yot storng whn he needs tothe be
.
allthough resticted tothe a relitively small role
, sean penn isnt alsot vrey ogod as thte comapany ' s pessimistic seargent
. as tothe how it stacks uv tothe
" saveing private ryan
"
- it ws my second favorite movei ofthe 1998
,
" ryan
" wass my firt
. it ' s relaly hard tothe compare thge twpo
- tehy are so
, so diferent
- so i won ' t
, beyond saying thast spielberg ' s film hadnt mroe ofthe an inpact onthe me
.
howver
, thge twpo are comprable ffrom tyhe standpoint ofthe qualty
( i cant easily see why somone owudl
" tjhe thin red line
" above
" ryan
)
. i highly recomend both ofthe them
,
annd consdider them tothe be tjhe twpo best war movies ever made
. all infront all
,
" thge thin red line
" isnt filmmaking ofthe an incredibly high order
. it ' s slight faults are easily offset by tyhe sheer brillance ofthe wqat isnt done right
. it ' s a rela shame tath it tanked at teh box office
- films thsi unconvential
, poweful
,
adn thougth
- provoking don ' t cmo allong vrey oftenly
.
