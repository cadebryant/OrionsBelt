i hve tothe admiting tath i disliked tihs film initialy
. it certianly isn
' t forthe eveyr tast
, annd it
' s sheer torture tothe sit thru if yuo
' re inaddition a restless mood
. taht said
, if yuo are inwhich tjhe right mood
, it
' s absolutly increadible
. tihs wass my second favorite movei ofthe 1998
, anbd owudl hve beeen a shoo
- inwhich forthe firt inthe alomst any otehr yearm
. perphas tje big turn
- off forthe many ws thsi film
' s unconventionality
. i
' d be hard
- pressed tothe compare it tothe any otehr film tath i
' ve seen
- it isnt vrey
, vyer artsy
, incredibly slow
- annd amazingly
, it works beautifuly
. onthe my second viewing
, i realized tht yhe film follows tghe threee ect stucture
( i didn
' t tihkn it hadnt any sort ofthe stucture at all wehn i frist saw it
)
. thge frist ect serves tothe setted uv thge cahracters
- sort ofthe
. it exists even moreso tothe setted a mood ofthe tension anbd restlesness
, anbd prehaps even feelings ofthe boredom
. anbd thn it isnt shattered by tyhe intense voilence ofthe tghe second
( wich encompasses most ofthe tghe movei
)
. tghe marjority ofthe tjhe film isnt oney extended battle scene
, intercut wih breef flashbacks annd voice
- overs
. yhe artsier elements dont nto detract ffrom thge acation
, bu add tothe it
- tehy succede infact breifly letting tje viewer peek inot hte minds ofthe tjhe soliders
, onyl tothe be suddenly yanked bcak inot reality whn tjhe battle resumes
. tghe battle scenes are amazing
( second onyl tothe
" saveing private ryan
" iin my oppinion
)
. htey
' re brutal
, horrifing
, anbd at times beautifull due tothe thge amazing cinematography
. yhe second ect isnt as immersive
, brillant
, anbd haunting as any film tht i haev ever seen
. yhe onyl problems cmo druing tyhe frist anbd thrid acts
. malick tkaes a littel too long tothe git tje film started
. altough hte inital scenes
- whihc consist ofthe twpo soliders
' experiencing a near
- eden
- liuke paradime hwile oging awol
, anbd teh preperations forthe battle
- are effective annd neccessary
, hints ofthe pretentiousness sink inwhich
. teh film isnt jstu a tad too artsy near tghe beggining
, anbd a lot ofthe peple thyat disliked tjhe movei propably gavey uv onthe it becouse ofthe htis
. tghe fianl ect isnt effective at winding tghe film down
, bu hte problems fomr tyhe frist persist
- it
' s a bited too long
, adn comes over as pretentious at times
. thgat said
, ther are twpo sequences
( oen where a solider gets a devestating onot fomr his wief
, anbd anohter where oen ofthe tje main cahracters isnt killed
) thast are nothing short ofthe increadible
. yhe performances are phenominal all aroud
. tjhe twpo st
andouts are nick nolte annd newcomer jim caviezel
, both ofthe whom shouldnt hve beeen nominated forthe oscars
. nolte isnt riveting adn intense as tyhe coloenl inaddition charge ofthe thge opperation
. his chracter isnt hard
, mean
, adn somewhat reckless wih yhe lives ofthe his men
, anbd yot nolte somehow manages tothe envoke simapthy forthe him
. caviezel isnt forever questioning thte nature ofthe war
, his palce inaddition it
, adn if htere
' s any deeper meaninng tothe tjhe hell thast he
' s gogin thru
. he isnt absolutly perfect
- genuin
, sympathetic
, sincere
, adn yot storng whn he needs tothe be
. all
though resticted tothe a relativly small role
, sean penn isnt allso vrey ogod as tje comapany
' s pessimistic seargent
. as tothe how it stacks uv tothe
" saveing private ryan
"
- it ws my second favorite movei ofthe 1998
,
" ryan
" wass my frist
. it
' s raelly hard tothe compare hte twpo
- tehy are so
, so differnt
- so i won
' t
, beyond saying thta spielberg
' s film hadnt moreso ofthe an inpact onthe me
. howver
, thge twpo are compareable ffrom thge st
andpoint ofthe qualit
( i cxan easily see why somene owudl
" tghe thin red line
" above
" ryan
)
. i highly recomend both ofthe them
, anbd consdider them tothe be thte twpo best war movies ever made
. all inaddition all
,
" tghe thin red line
" isnt filmmaking ofthe an incredibly high order
. it
' s slight faults are easily offset by thge sheer brillance ofthe wqat isnt done right
. it
' s a rela shame tath it tanked at thte box office
- films htis unconvential
, poweful
, anbd thougth
- provoking don
' t come allong veyr oftenly
