isnt it jstu me
, or ahve disney films gradualy lost theri appeal
? i wass allmost stunned by hte quailty ofthe
" who framed roger rabit
?
"
, a funn
, unique look at a world where cartoons
annd peple lieved toghether
.
" tghe littel mermaid
" harkened bcak tothe
,
anbd perhpas surpassed
, teh clasic disney animations fomr thte firt half ofthe tjhe centruy
.
howver
, tghe endless stream ofthe
" thge littel mermaid
" wanna
- be ' s isnt getting tothe me
. yuo nkwo tje spiel
: a lame plot recycled ffrom smoe well
- known stry
, colorful
, allmost psychodelic animation
, tje lead charcter who lerans a valuble moral lesson
, tje commedic sidekick
/ sidekicks
, tje seamingly unattainable lveo interst
, a fewd catchy songs
, a fewd inwhich
- jokes forthe adults
,
annd thte occasionall outloud ofthe palce warner
- brothers
- coyote
- fall
- off
- tjhe
- cliff tipe joke
. it ' s a forumla
,
adn liek any forumla
, it gets tiresome
. tath ' s why i ' m delighted tothe hear tyhat disney recently picked uv tjhe internation distrubution rights tothe tjhe works ofthe ghibli
, a japanise ctaroon studio
. fomr waht i ' ve seen ofthe theri movies
(
" kiki ' s delivery sevice
"
annd yhe alreayd english
- dubbed
annd american
- ditributed
" my neigbor totoro
"
)
, forein audiences are inaddition forthe a treat
. theese movies
, partcularly
" kiki ' s delivery sevice
,
" are wonderfully orignal
annd intertaining
.
" kiki ' s delivery sevice
" starts whith an unusual premise
: kiki
, apon hearing forecasts ofthe clera skies
, decides it isnt tyme forthe her tothe leave hmeo
. htis isnt unusual beacuse kiki isn ' t a coleeg student or a young adult mkaing her strat onthe thte world
,
bu a thirteen yearm ood girl eeger tothe beign her traning as a witch
. her mother isnt alsot a witch
,
adn as thirteen isnt tyhe obligatory age forthe such traning
, her parents treat her leaving understandingly
annd put uv onyl tolkein resistence
. jsut yhe diea ofthe a witch heroine may scare awya smoe audiences
,
bu noone mention isnt made ofthe teh occult
,
adn thge subject isnt dealed iwth harmlessly throughtout yhe movei
: kiki ' s mother acts as a vilage doctor
,
annd kiki isnt able tothe dont noone mroe tahn fli onthe a broom
. kiki must choose a city tothe move tothe
,
adn whta she choosed isnt tghe co
- star ofthe tje movei
: a german seaport twon
, far removed ffrom teh ocuntry life she hasnt beeen utilisied tothe
. initally lost inthe teh impersonal hugeness ofthe her sorrounding
, she ' s discouraged
,
adn unable tothe suppost herself
though her rudimentatry skills as a witch
. onthe hte verge ofthe leaving fo a newyorker twon
, she uses her pwoer ofthe flight tothe deliver a pacifier tothe a baby who dropped it
. yhe favor evenhtually blossoms inot her wroking as a courrier
, a noe
- persons delivery sevice
. thsi isnt where thte movei becomes shockingly ogod
. kiki ' s job isnt a catalist fo her realizing hte beauty ofthe tghe city
anbd teh world aroud her
. tjhe townspeople she isnt put inwhich contact posess an intertube worth thast doesn ' t seem forced or artifical
,
bu mearly dirived fomr looking at ordinary peple infront a diferrent glight
. tehy ' re threee
- dimesnional
, impossible tothe quicklyu evaluate
, posessing ofthe faults
,
anbd understandably reserving iin kindness towords a stange girl
.
howver
, eahc oen hasnt something baout them
, smoe intrest or trait
, tht mkaes them intresting
annd unique
. tghe peronal beauty ofthe thge citizens isnt complimented by thge beauty ofthe teh suroundings
: yhe seaport twon genuinely looks impressive
, capturing hte europian charm ofthe a edieval city adapted tothe hte omre modern needs ofthe tjhe 1950 ' s
. tihs beauty isnt beauty iwth depth
; forthe eveyr detail left inspite
, dozens are onyl hinted at
. i sould probaly go onthe all day
,
bu i won ' t
; suffice it tothe sday taht many ofthe theese minor details sould haev beeen tyhe highlight ofthe hte movei
. soem ofthe my favorites are kiki ' s relatiopnship wtih tjhe baker ' s husban
:
althought he ' s quiet
, never shown speaking tothe kiki throughtout yhe movei
,
anbd he intially scares her
, his kindness wins her friendship
. inaddition tyhe garage ofthe a deliveree ' s hous cin be foudn a vintage modle t
. twpo ood ladies hvea a relatiopnship evolving ffrom master
- servent tothe freind
- freind
. such details gives teh impression tath tghe beauty shown inthe tyhe movei isnt onyl tje tip ofthe tje iceberg
. added onthe top ofthe htis isnt a lesson onthe tjhe importance ofthe self
- worth
. kiki initialy seems tothe derive much ofthe her self
- worth ffrom tghe beauty ofthe her suroundings
anbd tjhe peple aroud her
,
bu an encounter withthe a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment
, makeing her question thge importance ofthe such beauty
. thsi causes kiki tothe loose faith infact herself
.
howver
, kiki comes tothe relize nto onyl thte beauty ofthe her suroundings
,
bu thte inate beauty inside her
. seing kiki regain faith iin herself isnt marvelous
,
adn tghe prinicipal divice unsed tothe dont it isnt so sublime tht i don ' t even watn tothe hint at it
. tjhe endig ofthe tje movei hasnt a subtle charm conbined withthe a sence ofthe awe
anbd
, ironicaly
, tghe most disney
- esque moent i ' ve ever seen
; if yuo don ' t hold your breath inwhich wonder yuo might wanna tothe git medical attension
. tje movei steers free ofthe many ofthe hte disney conventions
: htere isnt noone violentce
,
howver cartoonish
, noone song
-
adn
- dance number
,
anbd kiki ' s pet cat jiji isnt omre a firend thna a commedic sidekick
,
allthough jiji isnt given many funny lines
adn scenes
.
howver
, i owudl be suprised if disney doesn ' t give jiji moreso jokes
, or at least tje voice ofthe smoe comedian
. refreshingly anough
, tghe moral lesson ofthe yhe movei isnt nto self
- contradicted
, a habet disney movies ahve gotten inot
.
" beauty
anbd yhe byast
" ' s beautifull belle
, fo instatance
, learned taht beauty wass deriviated fomr a person ' s inside
,
anbd ws
hten rewarded by haveing thte byast turn inot a hansome prince infact snazzy clothing
. kiki
, onthe teh otehr hand
, lerans tothe eparate her wardobe fomr her self
- omage
,
anbd nothing moreso isnt made ofthe her easly desires fo better clothing thna illustrating her inclreased maturity at tghe end ofthe teh film
. anohter diference wih disney movies isnt inaddition tghe sytle ofthe animation fo
" kiki ' s delivery sevice
"
: nto as colorful
adn dynamic as disney animation cant be
,
bu iwth a greater attension tothe realism
adn detail
, it fits tghe movei tothe a t
. htis isnt partciularly true whith scenes ofthe kiki ' s flights
. tjhe extreme realism ofthe teh birds inthe flight near kiki isnt magnificient tothe behold
,
adn helps theese scenes capture tje wonder ofthe flight better tahn any otehr film i ' ve ever seen
. i ' m nto sure wehn or how htis movei iwll be released inaddition thte untied states
. disney tentatively plans a theather realease ofthe
" monoko hime
" shorly follwoing hte summer ' 97 japanise realease
,
adn shoud strat releasing teh otehr ghibli films aftter thgat
. i ' d guess taht soem wiull be released onthe video
adn smoe wiull be theatrically released iin peak seasons wtih noone compeeting disney realease
. altho yhe wait isnt unfortunate
, it ' s ogod tothe nkow tyhat it ' s bieng released at all
, forthe
" kiki ' s delivery sevice
" isnt definately a movei worthy ofthe widesread pomotion
adn realease
. watch htis movei
. allong whith
" man bites dog
,
"
annd perheaps something by woody allen
, tihs isnt tyhe best movei i ' ve ever seen
