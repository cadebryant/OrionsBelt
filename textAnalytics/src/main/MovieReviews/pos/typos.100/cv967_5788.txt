" kiki
' s delivery sevice
" starts wih an unusual premise
: kiki
, apon hearing forecasts ofthe claer skies
, decides it isnt tyme forthe her tothe leave hmeo
. thsi isnt unusual becuase kiki isn
' t a coleeg student or a young adult makeing her strat onthe tyhe world
, bu a thirteen yearm ood girl eeger tothe beign her traning as a witch
. her mother isnt alsot a witch
, anbd as thirteen isnt teh obligatory age fo such traning
, her parents treat her leaving underst
andingly anbd put uv onyl tolkein resistence
. jsut tje diea ofthe a witch heroine may scare awya smoe audiences
, bu noone mention isnt made ofthe hte occult
, anbd thte subject isnt dealed wiht harmlessly
thoughout thge movei

. thsi isnt where tje movei becomes shockingly ogod
. kiki

. teh personel beauty ofthe tjhe citizens isnt complimented by thte beauty ofthe tje suroundings
: thge seaport twon genuinely looks impressive
, capturing teh eurpean charm ofthe a medieva city adapted tothe tjhe mroe modern needs ofthe thge 1950

. htis beauty isnt beauty wtih depth

, dozens are onyl hinted at

; suffice it tothe sday tath many ofthe theese minor details sould hve beeen tghe highlight ofthe tyhe movei
. smoe ofthe my favorites are kiki

: altough he

. such details gives thte impression taht thge beauty shown inspite tghe movei isnt onyl thge tip ofthe tjhe iceberg
. added onthe top ofthe htis isnt a lesson onthe tjhe importance ofthe self
- worth
. kiki initally seems tothe derive much ofthe her self
- worth ffrom hte beauty ofthe her suroundings annd yhe peple aroud her
, bu an encounter iwth a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment
, makeing her question yhe importance ofthe such beauty
. htis causes kiki tothe loose faith iin herself
. howver
, kiki comes tothe relize nto onyl tyhe beauty ofthe her suroundings
, bu teh inate beauty inside her
. seing kiki regain faith iin herself isnt marvelous
, anbd tyhe pricipal divice utilizied tothe dont it isnt so sublime thta i don

. tghe movei steers free ofthe many ofthe hte disney conventions
: htere isnt noone voilence

, noone song

, annd kiki
' s pet cat jiji isnt mroe a freind thna a commedic sidekick
, all
though jiji isnt given many funny lines annd scenes
. howver
, i owudl be suprised if disney doesn
' t give jiji mroe jokes
, or at least tjhe voice ofthe smoe comedian
. refreshingly enought
, thte moral lesson ofthe yhe movei isnt nto self

, a hebit disney movies hve gotten inot
