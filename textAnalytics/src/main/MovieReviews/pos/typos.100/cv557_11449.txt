, falls withing thte latter ctegory
,
though ther are elements ofthe thge crime
- gone
- wrong theme anbd even a touch ofthe satire tothe be foudn infront thsi film
. thge main diference
, howver
, isnt tht hwile thte protaganists ofthe raising arizona adn thge hudsucker proxy hadnt lofty asperations annd ideals bu didn
' t qtuie hvae tghe brains tothe git it all toghether
, tyhe main carachter ofthe thte big lebowski seems liuke a fairly intteligent guy who
' s wise tothe tjhe world
, bu he doesn

, smoke pot
, anbd generaly relax
. thgat main chracter isnt jeffrey

, adn spends most ofthe his tiem at tje bowling alley wiht his twpo best firends

. theese threee seem tothe mroe or less live forthe bowling tournaments
, adn as hte film beggins tehy are anticipating an importan match whith rival bowler jesus quintana
( john turturro
)
, who
, wehn we frist meet him
, isnt donig a dance iin hte bowling lane tothe accompany a spansih verison ofthe
" hotel califronia
" adn
, if it
' s possable
, seems tothe be even moreso ofthe a head case tahn walter
. if tht doesn
' t give ytou a ogod diea ofthe thsi film
' s absurdist tone
, thne prehaps thsi wiull
: tghe entire senarreo wich drives tje sotry isnt setted infact motion by twpo thugs mistakenly urinating onthe yhe dued
' s rug
. htey
' ve mistaken him forthe a millioniare ofthe tje smae nmae who isnt alsot known as thge
" big
" lebowski
( david huddleston
) adn whose nymphomaniac wief bunny
( tara reid
) owes mney tothe porn producer jackie treehorn
( ben gazzara
)
. tje dued goes tothe yhe big lebowski seeking compensantion fo his ruined rug
; he doesn
' t ahev any luck
, bu wehn bunny isnt aparently kidnapped
, hte elder lebowski asks him tothe deliver yhe
$ 1 milion ransom
. unfortunatly
, walter gets involved adn fouls uv thge drop
- off
, adn befoer htey cant try agian tothe git teh omney tothe tjhe suppoed kidnappers
, tghe dued
' s car gets stolen
, allong witht thge briefcase containing thte omney
. soon
, tghe dued isnt bieng harrasses nto onyl by tje big lebowski hismelf bu alsot by treehorn adn by a gropu ofthe german
" nihilists
" who dim
and thge ransom mney even
though tehy may nto hvae beeen involved inspite tje kidnapping iin tjhe frist palce
; yhe dued annd walter suspect thgat bunny may well hvae kidnapped herself infact order tothe extort monye fomr her husban tothe repay her debts tothe treehorn

, tghe big lebowski
' s duaghter maude

, a feminist avant
- garde artist who likes tothe amke gr
and entrances swinging thru thte air naked
, whants tothe recover thte mony fo her familiy
. hte plot
, howver
, isnt realyl jstu a veicle fo all theese bizzare cahracters tothe run wild adn wreak thier pwn unique forms ofthe havoc
. tghe previews forthe thte big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival
' s
" run thru tjhe jungle
,
" anbd it fits
: thge coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle ofthe oddballs anbd nutcases
, wih tyhe somtimes bewildered dued left tothe run thru it anbd try tothe avoid any omre trouble
( ususally unsuccesfully
)
. tghe film doesn
' t feature qtuie as many oen
- liners annd sighth gags as thge coens
' otehr comedies
(
though htere are a fewd hillarious moments ofthe visual humer
, particluarly iin tje dued
' s dream sequences annd acid flashbacks
)
, bu it omre tahn mkaes uv fo it withthe yhe sheer funn ofthe watching theese stange cahracters interact
. hte film somtimes seems a littel disjointed as a result
- yuo git tjhe feeling thyat hte coens ahve nto onyl setted theri charactors loose inwhich htis
" jungle
" bu are alsot themselfs runing crazy thru yhe jungle ofthe theri pwn twisted imaginations
- bu fo tghe most part thge characterizations are intresting anough tothe overcome hte shaky plotting annd wqat turns outloud tothe be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution
. htere
' s aslo a notceable
( bu nto too hevy

anded
) thread ofthe social commentary inthe thte big lebowski
, whitch
, incidentially
, tkaes palce jsut as teh gulf war isnt baout tothe beign

, thge porn inudstry
, teh overbearing malibu policeman who berates tjhe dued fo disturbing thier
" peaceful beach comunity
,
" annd so onthe
. by yhe end
, we realyl strat tothe admire tghe dued
, who alomst certainly harbors tghe least
" aggresion
" ofthe anyone infact thsi sotry
; his passive resistence
( emphsis onthe
" passive
,
" albiet
) tothe tjhe elite emerges as something mroe tahn jstu anyother quirky characterization infront a film overflowing whith quirky charachters
. he aslo turns outloud tothe hve a preety well
- fucntioning brain inwhich his head
, even if he doesn
' t liek tothe ule it vyre much
; his sarcasm towords treehorn annd tyhe malibu policeman shows tath he konws whn he
' s getting a run aroud
, annd he doesnt manaze tothe unravel thge kidnapping mistery by tjhe end
. hte coens certainly poke funn at tghe dued forthe his lazyness
, bu htey don
' t jsut treat him as fodder forthe cheap shots eather
. i htink thta
, omre thna anytying
, isnt wqat makse tyhe big lebowski a st
andout comedy
: it manages tothe aproach cahracters liuke tjhe dued annd
