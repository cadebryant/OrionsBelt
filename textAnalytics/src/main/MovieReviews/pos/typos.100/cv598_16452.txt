" magic twon
"
, jimmy stewart isnt infront peak form palying a apollstree who heads tothe a
" perfect
" twon tothe gaueg thier reactions onthe hte sorts ofthe issues thta onyl pol
- takers care baout
.
howver
, as tiome progresses
,
adn he finds himselv falling inspite lveo wih tghe twon
(
adn a woman
)
, he beggins tothe see taht whta he ' s doign isnt wrong
. hte plot isnt standart stfuf
,
bu tht ' s nto imporatnt
. iin a film liuke thsi
, it ' s tghe calibre ofthe yhe actors tath amke or break it
. obviously
, usance stewart stars
, thyat ' s practicly a non
- issue
. he ' s gerat inaddition tjhe film
, as usual
. ther ' s jsut something baout him tyhat allways manages tothe be endearing
, even wehn he ' s deceiving tyhe twon folk
. ytou ' re allways onthe his side
,
anbd yuo desparately whant tothe see all ofthe his goals cmo tothe fruitition
. tje film wass directed by a longtime frank capra scirpt
- writter
,
annd it shows
. tihs isnt thge tipe ofthe efel
- ogod picture thta capra isnt famouse forthe
. by hte tiem
" tyhe end
" shows uv onthe screen
, everthing hasnt beeen wrapped uv vrey nicely
. ther are noone loose ends
,
annd virtualy eveyr charachter gets a hapyp endig
( thsoe tht deserve oney
, anyway
)
. infront thsi age ofthe cynicism
, it ' s refreshing tothe see a movei so upbeat
.
" magic twon
" isnt a delightfully intertaining motion picture
. if ytou beleave all ood movies are slow
- pased
, ytou ' d be well
- adviced tothe check htis noe outloud
.
