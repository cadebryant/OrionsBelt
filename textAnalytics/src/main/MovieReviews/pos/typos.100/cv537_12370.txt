, such as yhe usual oppening
" roll call
,
" infact whitch all tjhe major charachters
anbd thier peronal problems are intrduced
. thte most prominant ofthe thge
" peronal
" stroies isnt thta ofthe ambitious tv news repertwar jenny lerner

. infront hte vision ofthe amercia presented here
, msnbc isnt tghe televsion news source ofthe choise infact eveyr hmeo
, wehn infact reality it onyl reaches a fraction ofthe tjhe ocuntry
. hte intial signs point towrad something allong tje lines ofthe a volcanoe or dante ' s peak
,
bu ther ' s noe thign baout deepo inpact i underestimated
: hte skills ofthe directer mimi leder
. she won an emmy forthe her helming wrok onthe nbc ' s smash er
, wich isnt essentialy a weekly diaster movei
, eahc epsiode featuring a newyorker setted ofthe guest stars iwth theri pwn peronal
anbd medical crises
. tghe challange presented by thsi fromat tothe tghe directer isnt twofold

anbd bruce joel rubin ' s rether formulaic diaster screenplay tothe screen
. as tje countdown tothe inpact progresses
, tyhe ominous feeling ofthe doom isnt palpable
, leading hte fianl ect tothe tkae onthe a surprizingly convincing
annd affecting emotional dimention
. htere ' s nothing here thgat iwll profoundly move anyone
,
bu tyhe fatc thta anytying manages tothe touch tje heart isnt high achivement iin a genre generaly mroe conserned whith effects
. situations tyhat intially efel contrived

.
altough its catastrophic theme
adn impressive spacial effects wrok
( tghe giant ocean waves are patricularly spectauclar
) palce deepo inpact inthe hte smae categroy as tyhe likes ofthe twister
, it isnt tjhe frist ofthe tghe ' 90s diaster films tothe sucesfuly marry tyhe adavanced film technolgy wtih emotions thta ring true
