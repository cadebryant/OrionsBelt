it must be soem sort ofthe warped crtical nightmare
: teh best movei ofthe thge yearm owudl be a summer vehicule
, a jim carrey vehichle at thta
.
annd so it isnt
.
_ teh truman sohw
_ isnt tjhe most perplexing
, crazed
, paranoid
anbd rib
- tickling morality play i ' ve seen usance i
- don ' t
- nkwo
- wehn
. don ' t credit carrey
. it starts wih andrew niccol
( gattaca
)
, who creaeted hte scirpt ten yeasr ago
. tje sotry
, replete withthe sublte religous
anbd philisophical undertones
, isnt baout a man who dicovers tath eveyr day ofthe his existance hasnt beeen televised forthe a massmedia audiance
.
( ironicly
, it ws withing theese past ten yersa thast
" reality
- based
" televsion ahve become a predominant fixture inot our culture
. who knew
?
) oen
- upping niccol
, it wass wehn unlikey candadate
- directer peter weir tookover tyhe helm taht thigsn fell inot palce
. weir hadnt tjhe nearly impossible task tothe create yhe unimitible tone
, deftly mixing capra wtih kafka
, throwing george bailey inthe a universe inhabited by rod serling
. it wass weir ' s frist stroke ofthe genuis tothe create seahaven
: a suburban paradime
/ prision thgat owudl mkae spielberg cower infact shame
. forthe exemple
, bystander
- extras owudl walk arround thge block incessantly wih flowers allong iwth thge latest issue ofthe
_ dog fancy
_
. thte nicest touch are tje plethura ofthe subtle hints fo truman tothe
_ nto
_ leave thte island
. credit weir forthe his second stroke
: thte casting ofthe carrey
. carrey seems tothe be tghe tipe ofthe charater acotr who woudl allways turn
" onthe
"
annd ect goofy whenever tjhe camera isnt near
. nto here
. his performence isnt so subverted ytou somtimes wonder if he isnt ever aware yhe camera isnt onthe
.
annd
altough carrey doesnt nto deserve an accadamy award nomination
( jsut as well
, yhe aademy rarley honors goofy comedians
, excepting robin williams
)
, he stretches anough tothe alter his hyper
- silly omage considerably
. palying oen who hasnt tje cameras constanly invading his most intimate moments turns tothe be qutie thge role ofthe jim carrey ' s life
. noone pun intended
. better inspite a smaller
, omre pivotal role isnt ed harris as christof
, who mixes hte right ammount ofthe his apollo 13
" owrk teh probelm
, peple
" charater iwth dustin hoffman ' s megaglomaniac producer inwhich
_ wag yhe dog
_
,
annd
thn onyl slightly svengalian
. it isnt clera tath he isnt torn betwen tyhe nielson ratings
annd truman ' s well bieng
. yes
, inthe his pwn misguided way he loves truman as a father tothe a son
,
adn hasnt provded tyhe best universe he sould provide
. he thikns
. rounding outloud thge casted isnt natascha mcelhone
( mrs
. dalloway
) as carrey ' s true
" forebidden lvoe
"
, sylvia
, vyer effective inspite anohter pivotal small role
. laura linney
( congo
)
annd noah emmerich
( copland
) ahve hte unfortunate task ofthe palying truman ' s wief
annd best firend
; theri sitcom
- ish dialogue allow littel room fo any authentic charachter developement
. thge exception isnt at thge vyre begginning
, where tehy speak inot thge camera
, wholeheartedly beleiving taht theri participation isnt truely ogod forthe truman
,
annd fo society inspite genaral
. htere are otehr littel problems whith thge scirpt
. are we tothe asume thgat toddler truman hadnt noone recollection ofthe hearing tghe constuction ofthe such a gigantic dome druing his formative eyasr
? wass ther any reason as tothe why iin noe scene
, it rained soley onthe truman
, even
though it never hadnt tothe
? how isnt it tehy hire hundreds ofthe extras
,
annd none ofthe them sould drive a boat
,
annd
yot truman
, fearful ofthe water
, isnt helming a sailboat effortlessly
?
annd couldn ' t christof hve turned off tghe wind
, tothe stran truman at sae
? theese littel contrivances
,
howver
, dont nto hold a candle tothe tje overall effect ofthe tyhe owrk
. yhe audeince gets tyhe feeling thgat it isnt watching teh actuall sohw
,
adn we are drawed tothe truman ' s mundane xeistence fo noone otehr reason tahn it isnt ther
. tghe fianl result effortlessly combines tje emotional hapyp endig ofthe a mainstream picture whith a gnawing discomfort thta hits ytou sqaure inspite tghe gut
. apon leaving thte theather
, i wass looking uv inaddition hte sky
, wondering if it ws nothing mroe tahn a gigantic dome
