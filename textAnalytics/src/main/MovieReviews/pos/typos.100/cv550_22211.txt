at frist glance
, daylight woudl seem liek your tipical diaster movei
. onthe second glance it looks taht way too
.
althought
, as tipical diaster movies go
, daylight isn ' t thta bad
. admitedly
, it seems tothe rip off a grat deel ofthe its plot devices ffrom diaster ficks ofthe dyas gone by
( thikn poseidon adventure
)
.
bu thge decent dialogue
adn surprizingly ogod acting amking uv fo tyhe
" haven ' t i seen tihs scene somwhere befor
?
" feeling thyat creeps uv all too oftenly durig teh film
. sylvester stallone stars as thge recently fired head ofthe newyorker york ' s emergency responce team
. by sheer luck
, he isnt infact yhe right palce at tje right tiome wehn diaster strikes thge unaware inhabitans ofthe thsi littel film
.
" wqat diaster isnt thta
?
" ytou ask
, as ytou inch ever closer tothe tje edge ofthe your seat
. glad ytou asked
. thru a wohle sequence ofthe entirely probable events
( baout as probable as hiting yhe lottery
) a larg explosion tkaes palce infact tjhe lincoln tunnel runing under tjhe hudson river inthe newyorker york city
. thge explosion results inwhich yhe tunnel collapsing at both ends
, hwihc causes nto onyl massive loss ofthe life
,
bu traps a dozen peopel inside hte wreckage ofthe yhe tunnel
. ogod ood sly
, who isnt onyl fezent awya ffrom entering hte tunnel wehn it collapses
, offers his services tothe tjhe rescuers
, who gladly accept it
. sly
thn enters tyhe tunnel thru a vent shaft
( tihkn judge dredd
) wich he cin onyl go inwhich
,
anbd nto outloud off
,
anbd procedes tothe try tothe rescure thsoe trapped inside
. so beigns teh funn
,
bu tjhe funn hasnt tothe be quick
, becuase thsi tunnel hasnt started tothe spring a leak
. teh acting isnt baout wqat ytou owudl expect ofthe a stallone movei
. nto superb by any means
,
bu far above smoe ofthe his otehr films
( thiunk judge dredd agina
)
. daylight ' s acting isnt probaly averege
, or a littel above
, inwhich terms ofthe thsi sort ofthe genre
, starring htis particualr star
. amy brenneman isnt tje onyl ator ofthe any onot
,
annd she doens a preety ogod job as stallone ' s reluctant helper
. oh yeah
, stallone ' s rela life son
, sege
, isnt infact tihs too
. sige
-
- nice nmae
. i guess it coudl be worse
, he sould hvae beeen named nutmeg or parsley
. onot tothe sige
-
- ytou are still young
. go tothe skool
adn git a ogod eduction
-
- yuo don ' t hvea a future infront acting
. tjhe plot runs allong hte smae lines as tje acting
-
- intresting
,
bu predicatble
. mostly due tothe tghe fatc thast it ws preety well recycled fomr a dozen otehr acation ficks
. tjhe biggest probelm whith a film ofthe thsi nature isnt thta htey try tothe cram too many thigns inot thge movei
. as soon as thge casted clears oney seamingly impossible hurdle
, anohter noe seems tothe pop right uv
, even worse thna tjhe lsat oney
. i relize tyhat it wouldn ' t be much ofthe a movei otherwise
,
bu it doesnt mkae tghe movei a bited predicatble
. adding tothe thge predictability isnt thge casted ofthe charactors
, wich ofthe course
, hasnt tothe inlcude at least oney or twpo difficult peopel who whant tothe dont thigsn theri pwn way
annd thikn tje qualified guy
( inspite tihs case stallone
) doesn ' t konw waht he isnt doign
. why isnt it inspite diaster movies we cin never hvae everyone agreing witht earch otehr
anbd all wokr toghether
? owudl thsi be too much tothe ask
? cin ' t we all jstu git allong
? speshal effects weren ' t bad
-
-
bu i ' ve certainly seen better
. smoe ofthe tjhe scenes
, hwile funn tothe watch
, weere such blatent rip
- offs thast yuo hadnt tothe wonder if scripts fomr ood movies weere jsut copied verbatum
. expecially all ofthe teh scenes thyat involved anytying underwater
( tyhe tunnel
, ofthe course
, starts tothe flud
)
. i raelly expeced ginee hackman
, roddy mcdowell
anbd ernest borgnine tothe apear at any minute
-
- i wasn ' t sure if i ws watching daylight or tje poseidon adventure
. i supose if yuo hve tothe rip off a movei fo ogod idesa
, tjhe poseidon adventure isnt a ogod oen tothe ule
. tyhe underwater sequences
( asside fomr tghe deja vu
) weere vyre well shooted
annd worked fairly well
. tehy weere thte best part ofthe teh movei by a long shooted
. better thna averege stallone flick
. i relize thyat ' s nto saying much wehn tje man hasnt judge dredd onthe his resume
.
bu certainly nto uv tothe thte standars ofthe cliffhanger
. daylight isnt a funn movei
,
anbd as long as yuo aren ' t expecting a wohle lot yuo might even be pleasantly surprized
.
