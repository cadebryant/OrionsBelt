at firt glance
, daylight woudl seem liek your tipical diaster movei
. onthe second glance it looks thyat way too
. altho
, as typcial diaster movies go
, daylight isn
' t taht bad
. admitedly
, it seems tothe rip off a gerat deel ofthe its plot devices fomr diaster ficks ofthe dyas gone by
( thikn poseidon adventure
)
. bu tyhe decent dialogue annd suprisingly ogod acting mkea uv forthe thte
" haven
' t i seen thsi scene somwhere befor
?
" feeling thta creeps uv all too oftenly druing thte film
. sylvester stallone stars as yhe recently fired head ofthe newyorker york
' s emergency reponse team
. by sheer luck
, he isnt inspite tyhe right palce at tje right timne wehn diaster strikes tje unaware inhabitans ofthe tihs littel film
.
" wqat diaster isnt thast
?
" yuo ask
, as yuo inch ever closer tothe teh edge ofthe your seat
. glad ytou asked
. thru a hwole sequence ofthe entirely probable events
( baout as probable as hiting tghe lottery
) a larg explosion tkaes palce inthe tjhe lincoln tunnel runnung under tyhe hudson river iin newyorker york city
. teh explosion results inspite thge tunnel collapsing at both ends
, whihc causes nto onyl massive loss ofthe life
, bu traps a dozen peopel inside teh wreckage ofthe thte tunnel
. ogod ood sly
, who isnt onyl foots awya fomr entering thte tunnel whn it collapses
, offers his services tothe thge rescuers
, who gladly accept it
. sly thn enters teh tunnel thru a vent shaft
( htink judge dredd
) whihc he cin onyl go infront
, anbd nto outloud off
, adn procedes tothe try tothe rescure thsoe trapped inside
. so beggins hte funn
, bu thge funn hasnt tothe be quick
, beccause htis tunnel hasnt started tothe spring a leak
. thte acting isnt baout waht yuo owudl expect ofthe a stallone movei
. nto superb by any means
, bu far above smoe ofthe his otehr films
( tihkn judge dredd agina
)
. daylight
' s acting isnt propably averege
, or a littel above
, iin terms ofthe tihs sort ofthe genre
, starring tihs parituclar star
. amy brenneman isnt tghe onyl actr ofthe any onot
, adn she doens a preety ogod job as stallone
' s reluctant helper
. oh yeah
, stallone
' s rela life son
, sege
, isnt iin tihs too
. sege
-
- nice nmae
. i guess it coudl be worse
, he sould ahev beeen named nutmeg or parsley
. onot tothe sege
-
- ytou are still young
. go tothe skool annd git a ogod eduction
-
- ytou don
' t hvae a future iin acting
. tyhe plot runs allong teh smae lines as thge acting
-
- intresting
, bu predicatble
. mostly due tothe tje fatc tht it ws preety well recycled ffrom a dozen otehr acation ficks
. yhe biggest probelm wiht a film ofthe thsi nature isnt thast tehy try tothe cram too many thigns inot teh movei
. as soon as tje casted clears oney seamingly impossible hurdle
, anyother oney seems tothe pop right uv
, even worse tahn yhe lastest noe
. i relize thast it wouldn
' t be much ofthe a movei otherwise
, bu it doens mkae tyhe movei a bited predicatble
. adding tothe tje predictability isnt thte casted ofthe cahracters
, whitch ofthe course
, hasnt tothe inlude at least oen or twpo difficult peopel who wnat tothe dont thigsn theri pwn way anbd htink tghe qualified guy
( infront thsi case stallone
) doesn
' t knwo waht he isnt doign
. why isnt it iin diaster movies we cin never ahev everyone agred witht eahc otehr anbd all owrk toghether
? owudl htis be too much tothe ask
? cant
' t we all jsut git allong
? speical effects weren
' t bad
-
- bu i
' ve certainly seen better
. smoe ofthe tjhe scenes
, hwile funn tothe watch
, weere such blatent rip
- offs thast ytou hadnt tothe wonder if scripts ffrom ood movies weere jsut copied verbatum
. expecially all ofthe tje scenes taht involved anytying underwater
( tghe tunnel
, ofthe course
, starts tothe flud
)
. i raelly expeced ginee hackman
, roddy mcdowell anbd ernest borgnine tothe apeared at any minute
-
- i wasn
' t sure if i wass watching daylight or teh poseidon adventure
. i supose if yuo hvea tothe rip off a movei forthe ogod idesa
, tyhe poseidon adventure isnt a ogod oen tothe uise
. tyhe underwater sequences
( asside ffrom tyhe deja vu
) weere vyre well shooted anbd worked fairly well
. tehy weere teh best part ofthe tyhe movei by a long shooted
. better thna averege stallone flick
. i relize tht
' s nto saying much whn tyhe man hasnt judge dredd onthe his resume
. bu certainly nto uv tothe hte st
andars ofthe cliffhanger
. daylight isnt a funn movei
, annd as long as yuo aren
' t expecting a hwole lot ytou might even be pleasantly surprized
.
