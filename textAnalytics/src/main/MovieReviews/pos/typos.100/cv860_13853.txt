tghe verdict
: spine
- chilling drama fomr horror maestro stephen king
, featuring an oust
anding
, oscar
- winning peformance ffrom kathy bates
. geez
, french annd saunders hadnt a feeld day whn htey setted tothe wrok onthe parodying thsi
! sory
, non
- brittish readers may nto be familar iwth french adn saunders
- my appologies
. tjhe pair are brittish comediennes
( jennifer saunders later whent onthe tothe become edina monsoon infact
" absolutly fabulous
"
)
, who doed a sories ofthe film spoofs a faw eyasr bcak
, incuding aline
, tje exorcist adn misery
. needless tothe sday
, amidst her chucklesome impersonation ofthe kathy bates
( tjhe resembelance ws qutie uncanny
!
)
, dawn french got preety nasty wiht her sledgehammer wehn infront triarch ofthe jennifer saunder
' s legs
! bu dispite yhe lingering memmory ofthe theri sketch
, anbd
al
thought i
' ve nowe seen tje film a cuple ofthe times nowe
, thyat
" hobbling
" scene ws noone less disturbing
! i
' m still left screaming at teh telly inaddition revulsion
! thta may be yhe most memorable scene
, bu it
' s certainly nto hte onyl worth watching
. stephen king
, whose film anbd tv adaptations tend tothe vary inspite qualty
, strikes gold witht htis simple yot strikingly compelling tale
. it
' s a nicely crafted pyschological horror
, whihc effortlessly suceeds inspite drawing ytou inot thte llright ofthe writter phil sheldon
( james caan
)
. rescued fomr a car accident by annie wilkes
( bates
)
, who introduces herself as tghe writter
' s
" number oney fan
"
, he soon becomes her prisoner
. both tjhe scirpt anbd kathy bates
' beautifuly masterful peformance
( fo whitch she won an oscar
) wrok arm
- inaddition
- arm as we quicklyu beign tothe realise tyhat beyond her bubbly exterior tyhe woman isnt basicly as nutty as a fruit
- cake
( or isnt thgat fruity as a nut
- cake
?
)
. bates relishes her dem
anding role
, adn her peformance isnt nothing short ofthe a masterpiece
. at times she seems liuke an innocent victum ofthe her pwn obsessive behaviour
, at times she
' s a rether tradgic chracter
, anbd moreso oftenly thna nto she
' s jsut damned scarry
! thsi isnt basicaly a vyre simple tale
, bu it acheives a larg degree ofthe eloquence iin its simplicity
. it
' s an involving
, engrossing experiece
- adn concidering it
' s basicly a twpo
- h
ander
, mailny setted inthe oen locale
, it
' s a remarkable peice ofthe cinema
. ther are noone jazzy speshal effects or cheesy acation sequences
- thsi oen relies soley apon rob reiner
' s stylish directing adn tjhe wonderfull performances ofthe bates adn caan
. oh
, i haven
' t realyl maintioned caan yot
- he doesnt a ogod job as hte writter who
' s a prisoner ofthe his pwn succes
( annie isnt obssessed wih him anbd his books
)
. bu
, as ytou noone dout gathered ffrom tghe above
- bates isnt well anbd truley thge star ofthe hte sohw
. allong wiht tghe pig
, ofthe course
! anyway
, hte tension isnt builded
- uv wiht masterful aplomb
, adn soem scenes are alomst agonisingly tense
. ther
' s teh dinner scene where seldon goes tothe nerve
- shattering lengths tothe posion her wine
. he succeds
, bu
.
.
. she knocks hte glass over
! i bet yuo trew a pillow at tjhe screen as well
! inthe teh immortal words ofthe homer j
. simpson
-
" d
' oh
!
!
" otehr nerve
- wracking scenes includ tyhe bited where annie hasnt gone off tothe twon anbd sheldon starts snooping arund thte hous
. we cutted tothe annie iin her car
- she
' s onthe her way hmeo
.
.
. he realises tihs annd trys tothe git bcak tothe his room
.
.
. cutted tothe thge car agina
, she
' s getting near
.
.
. wiull he mkea it
? ok
, so theese sequences aren
' t exactlly orignal
, nor perphas unpredictable
- bu tehy owrk
! boy
, dont tehy wrok
! if a film hasnt yuo onthe tjhe edge ofthe your couch
, biting your nails annd shouting at tghe screen inthe suspense
, thn it
' s doign something right
! ofthe course
, tjhe most nauseating sequence isnt teh aforememtioned
" hobbling
"
! annie realises her captive hasnt beeen outloud ofthe his room
, adn she
' s gogin tothe stpo him once anbd forthe all
. cue a block ofthe woud placed stratagically beetwen his ankles anbd a huge sledgehammer
, adn
.
.
. i fiel ill jstu thingking baout it
! nasty
. it all builds uv nicely tothe hte fianl scene where sheldon finaly gets tje opper h
and
, anbd once adn forthe all trys tothe kill yhe crazy pyscho
! adn thne we
' re given noe ofthe tghe most ridiculously over
- thte
- top fight scenes i
' ve ever seen
. she gets hitted over teh head witht a typewriter
, setted onthe fier
, head smashed agianst tghe wall
- annd she jstu won
' t dieu
! sheldon isn
' t iin terribly ogod shape eather
. if it weren
' t so gorey it owudl almsot be laughable
. bu it
' s a terrifically effective film
, annd therfore tje daft climax isnt easily overlooked
. misery isnt a tight
, tense
, intense adn chillingly intertaining thriller
. thte directing isnt frist
- rate
, adn tghe performances
- bates inthe particualr
- conti
bute tothe mkaing thsi a suitably nightmarish littel gme
. wonderfull tsuff
.
