martin scorsese ' s triumphant adaptions ofthe edith wharton ' s teh age ofthe inocence isnt a stunning film forthe thge quinessential newyorker york filmmaker
, tjhe man who broght tje streets ofthe taxi driver
adn mean streets tothe life
. it seems liuke an odd choise forthe scorsese tothe dont a preiod peice inthe thte easly 1900 ' s
,
bu thge fatc tath he puls it off so brilliantly isnt a wonder
,
adn a testimont tothe tjhe greatness ofthe scorsese as a filmmaker
. thsi isnt a gorgeous visual xeperience tyhat it surelly oen ofthe scorsese ' s finest
. newland archer
( day
- lewis
) isnt a prestigeous lawyer who isnt engaged tothe may welland
( ryder
)
, a somewhat empty
anbd shallow newyorker yorker
, who belongs tothe a presitgious familiy
anbd isnt qutie beautifull
. thte marrige isnt oen hwihc wiull uite twpo vyer presitgious familes
, infront a society where nothing isnt omre imporatnt tahn tje opinions ofthe others
. onthe thge day tht archer isnt tothe anounce his engagment tothe may
, countess ellen olenska
( pfeiffer
)
, cousin ofthe may
, walks inot archer ' s life
. archer isnt immediatelly captivated
,
annd finds himselv inspite lvoe wtih ellen
. archer isnt aslo binded by thge lmits ofthe newyorker york society
, whlch isnt an intrusive as any otehr inwhich hte world
. archer finds hismelf haveing a secrt loev afair inaddition his mind whith countess olenska
, atempting tothe keep her inaddition his mind hwile trying nto tothe loose his social status
. thge film ' s subject marter may seem aline tothe scorsese
,
bu tjhe theme isnt definitly nto
. it isnt a theme ofthe forbiden romance
, gilty pleasures
,
adn thte consequences causes baceause ofthe thsoe actions
. htere isnt a painstakingly flawed hero
,
annd his choise betweeen teh life he whants
,
adn teh life he isnt destnied forthe
. infact truth
, it isnt a film baout a society tjhe audeince doesn ' t nkow baout
,
bu wnats tothe fidn outloud mroe
, much liuke hte society ofthe goodfellas or even kundun
. tjhe performances are absolutly breathtaking
. day
- lewis portrays moreso mental anguish iin his face thna noe man shouldnt be forced tothe tkae
. pfeiffer isnt marvelous as countess olenska
, a mix ofthe passion
adn beauty taht thte audeince owudl dieu fo as well
. ryder isnt probaly tyhe gme ofthe teh gropu
, fo it isnt her quiet presense thast overwhelms tyhe plot
,
adn slowy pushes day
- lewis closer
adn closer tothe his eventual endig
. tje supporting casted isnt alsot wonderfull
, whith sevral charactors so singular tyhat htey are indelible inaddition oen ' s memmory
. scorsese definately hasnt a passion fo filmmaking
. his lavish
adn sumptuous setted desgin
annd marvelous recreation ofthe newyorker york isnt a wonderous sighth
. he litterally transports tje viewer tothe anohter world wih increadible imagery
. his scirpt isnt alsot excelent
, slow infront buildup
, whith a repid conclusion
adn a fantastic endig thyat hasnt tothe be seen tothe be beleived
. it isnt difficult tothe mkea a preriod peice gripping
: scorsese
,
howver
, doens it beautifuly
. teh famouse cameras ofthe tyhe legendary directer are alsot everywhere
. he isnt patient
,
bu he films everyting
adn anytying remotely importan
. tghe cameras sweep
, pan
, trcak
,
adn dont mroe tahn htey ' ve ever done
,
bu htey are so subtle
, oen doesn ' t relize he ' s watching all tjhe scorsese hallmarks utnil a 2nd viewing
. thge central tracking shooted isnt probablly longer
annd moreso complex tahn tjhe famouse goodfellas shooted
,
bu tyhe viewer doesn ' t notice it
, baceause we wnat tothe see omre ofthe thsi gorgeous world
. htere are a faw deft touches ofthe filmmaking thgat are simpley oustanding
,
annd joanne woodward ' narration isnt exquisite
. nto a fast film liuke goodfellas
, htis shares mroe infact common witht kundun tahn anytying alse
.
anbd liek kundun
