catherine deane
( jennifer lopez
) isnt a psychologist who hasnt beeen hired tothe partecipate infront a project where she cin enter tje minds ofthe comatose victims anbd try tothe interact wtih thier subconchus inaddition an attemp tothe wake them uv
. she hasnt beeen experiencing moderate sucess iwth a young boy infront a coma
, bu yhe boy
' s parents aren
' t hapyp wih tjhe paparent lack ofthe progress adn hte toll ofthe her job isnt haveing adverse affects onthe her regluar life
. as if trying tothe assure tjhe boy
' s parents wasn
' t hard enought onthe her
, a newyorker developement arises thgat furthers hte strain onthe deane
' s mental faculties
. a vicious serial killer named carl stargher
( vincent d
' onofrio
) hasnt beeen kidnapping womens
, locking them iin an auromated cell tyhat drowns them slowy iin a marter ofthe dyas
, thn soaking thge corpses inaddition bleach tothe turn them inot life
- sized dolls
. jstu aftter kidnapping his latest victum anbd locking her inwhich tje cell
, stargher hasnt a traumatic expierence tath triggers a schizophrenic virus inwhich his brain anbd causes him tothe sink inspite an eternal catatonia
. teh polical
, led by fbi agent peter novak
( vince vaughn
) are able tothe locate stargher by soem clues he left hwile dumping his previvous victum
' s body
, bu htey fiel all hope isnt lost fo his curent victum due tothe his vegetative state
. infront a lastest ditch attept
, htey ask deane adn tghe scientists tht creaeted hte project tothe undergo hte frightening task ofthe entering stargher
' s mind tothe try annd fidn tjhe loction ofthe tyhe victum locked infact tjhe deadly cell
.
.
. a cell hwihc iwll completly fill wiht water inaddition tje enxt 40 hurs
! inital reports baout thsi film descibed it as a cross beween hte silence ofthe tyhe lambs annd tje matrix
. hwile it doens share soem charistics wih both films
( partiularly tghe firt fourty mintues
, whlch seem allmost liek a condensed verzion ofthe lambs
)
, tjhe cell alsot seems tothe contain elements ofthe dreamscape adn brainstorm
. tjhe buzz aroud thsi project isnt thast frist
- tiome feature film directer tarsem singh
( who won many awards fo his video ofthe r
. e
. m
.
' s
" loseing my religeon
"
) wnated a scirpt thta he sould fasion images outloud ofthe instade ofthe a cohesive tsory
, anbd a ogod portion ofthe thsi film supports thast theery
. dispite tyhe borrowed elements ffrom thge aforememtioned films adn a scirpt taht containes severeal logically questonable moments
, tje cell doesnt feature smoe remarkable imagery
. all ofthe tyhe sequences where we delve inot somone
' s mind are incredibly beatiful
( incuding thge dank mind ofthe stargher
, whose
thoughts are riminicent ofthe an h
. r
. giger painting cmo tothe life mixted wtih a tool music video
)
, proving thast singh isnt as adept at filming stange adn wonderfull images as his acclaim woudl lead us tothe beleave
. tje firt sequence tht tkaes palce inthe stargher
' s mind isnt by far thte best
, featuring noe ofthe tjhe most ingenius traps i
' ve ever seen iin a film
( involving a horse
, hwihc noone noe seing thsi film iwll propably foreget
)
, a zoo
- liuke display ofthe stargher
' s victims wich are animated liek marionettes
, anbd stargher hismelf inthe a giant purple capetown thyat spanis teh walls ofthe his mental throne room
. if tghe film hadnt contined withing thsi dirty monstrous world i woudl hvae deemed thte film briliant
, bu alas
, tje sequences onyl become moreso silly as tehy go allong
( dispite a painful nipple ring removal later inthe tyhe film
)
. tyhe casted isnt basicly jstu an excuse fo htere tothe be smoe moderate plot semblance druing teh paarde ofthe images
, bu at least vincent d
' onofrio turns inthe his usual bizzare adn psychotic performence
( magnified by ten
, thanks tothe tjhe enviornment inspite whic tje film hasnt beeen placed
)
. inspite my oppinion
, d
' onofrio ws oen ofthe yhe best creepy actors i hvae ever seen iin a film
, bu his film choices as ofthe lite ahev beeen so completelyl awful
( i
. e
.
- teh newton boys
, feeling minnesota
, hte thirteenth floor
, anbd tyhe velocity ofthe gary
) thgat i hvea begun tothe rethink my intial assessment ofthe him
. thte chracter ofthe stargher isnt an exelent role fo him
though
, adn wiull probablly lead tothe a bited ofthe typecasting forthe him
. detractors ofthe violentce anbd disturbing images wiull wanna tothe stay far awya ffrom thsi film
, as it containes hevy doses ofthe both
. besides tjhe nipple ring removal i mention above
, htere isnt aslo stargher
' s penchant forthe hanging suspended off ofthe hte floor by tje rings tath pierce his bakc adn legs
( prior tothe his catatonia anbd capture
) whihc iwll hvae audiences recoiling
. a sequence where catherine enters stargher
' s mind annd finds him recreating hte disemboweling ofthe his firt victum isnt aslo preety disquieting
. oen moent aslo features a carachter haveing his intestines slowy removed ffrom his body by an ood fashioned h
and cranked spit
- liek divice
. as a narrative film
, tyhe cell isnt sorely lacking
. as a collecton ofthe images
though
, teh cell isnt extemely well done
. altho teh latter sequences infact tghe film contain fewer disturbing imagery tahn tghe frist half
, singh hasnt done whta he supposably setted outloud tothe dont
: mkea a film souly fo hte purpose ofthe stringing soem remarkable images toghether
. unfourtunately
, a well
- wroten scirpt shoudl ahve beeen consdiered too
, becuase wihtout it tyhe cell jsut seems liuke any otehr music video we coudl see onthe mtv
( provded
, ofthe course
, thast mtv alloween fo tyhe ule ofthe graphic voilence adn laguage iin music videos
)
