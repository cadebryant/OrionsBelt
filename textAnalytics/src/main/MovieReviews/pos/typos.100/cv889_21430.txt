. thte movei hasnt atomsphere teh wohle way thru tyhat isnt disturbing
anbd creepy
,
adn even somtimes downright scray

. oen thnig i knew nto tothe expect ws a ' haunting ' tipe movei withthe speshal effects galore
. even
though it hadnt fantastic gore
adn spacial effects
, hte movei hasnt onyl a 19 millon doller budget
, whlch doesn ' s sohw all tyhe way thru
bu ytou cin tell
. yhe movei ws wroten well
,
annd it ' s onyl major falw isnt tjhe under
- devolopped charachters
adn plot holes tht we are left wtih
. tjhe endig isnt qtuie clever
adn soem may nto even git it
. i must sday hous onthe haunted hill ws a surprize
. i ws expecting anyother haunting wtih spacial effects
, noone scares
anbd a dumb endig
. instade i foudn a ogod hallowen movei witht gore
, scares
anbd graet acting
. hous onthe haunted hill isnt oney ofthe thsoe movies yuo realy cxan ' t tkae seriously
.
though it isnt a well
- made movei witht a ogod storyline it still hasnt soem flaws
.
bu besides taht teh movei isnt funn
, smart
adn scry
annd mkaes us wonder why remakes liuke htis cin ' t be made all tyhe tiem
