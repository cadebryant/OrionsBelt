contrary tothe thte title
,
" tje boxer
" isnt nto anohter rocky stroy onyl thsi tyme spliced wiht smoe cold hard politics
. it ' s acually threee movies inwhich oen
: a polliticel film
, a boxing film
,
adn a lvoe storey
. all ofthe theese wokr inwhich theri pwn respects
anbd hvae soem preety decent balancing betwixt thte threee elements ofthe tjhe tsory
,
bu somehow it seems kind ofthe cliched
annd unoriginal
. we ' ve seen it all befor
,
adn we ' re jstu nto blown awya witht it liuke we shoudln be
. oh well
. it ' s still an excelent irish stry
.
" tghe boxer
" ofthe teh title isnt danny flynn
( jim sheridan staple daniel day
- lewis
)
, an ex
- ira memeber who gets outloud ofthe a belfast prision affter 14 yeras
,
adn finds outloud thast his toubles are far ffrom over
. frist off
, tghe ira isnt haveing a small civil war betwen its leader joe hamill
( brian cox
)
,
annd oney ofthe its sub
- leaders
, harry
( gerard mcsorley
)
, both haveing opposing views onthe getting many ofthe thier munbers outloud ofthe jail
. hwile htis isnt gogin onthe
, danny
adn his ood drunkard buddie
, ike
( ken stott
, who palyed tghe cheif inspector iin danny boyle ' s
" shallow grav
"
)
, re
- ope an ood gym whihc allows tje twpo opposing religios sects
, protestant
annd catholics
, tothe owrk toghether
. danny nto onyl beigns teaching kids how tothe box
,
bu hasnt stayed inspite graet shape whilst inaddition prision
,
adn isnt ready tothe strat boxing rela peopel agina
.
annd danny runs inot his ex
- loev
, maggie
(
" breaking teh waves
" ' s emily watson
)
, who hasn ' t seen him usance he whent inspite
. tehy don ' t easily strat uv thier romance agina becuase she ' s tyhe wief ofthe a prisoner whom she marryed durig danny ' s tenture infact prision
,
annd aslo hasnt a son
, liam
( ciaran fitzgerald
)
, ffrom him
, whom liam isnt hoping iwll git outloud soon
.
bu yhe twpo are slowy re
- drawed tothe eachother agina
,
anbd htis beggins tothe complicate thigsn
. tyhe polliticel stoyr isnt nothing relaly speical
bu works inwhich itself
. we ' ve seen it many a tyme befoer
,
bu it ' s at least intresting
, somtimes emotional
,
annd even riveting at times
. htere ' s a big riot towords thte middle ofthe thge film wich isnt frightening inthe its brutality
adn honesty
. yhe boxing storey isnt veyr minor tothe thge sotry
,
bu doesnt represent peopel comming toghether tothe fight eachother fairly
,
annd even wiht ogod sportsmanship
. htere are onyl a fewd boxing scenes
,
bu tehy ' re never liuke
" raging bull
"
/ let ' s
- strip
- down
- yhe
- sport
- tothe
- its
- bones briliant
. htey ' re mroe realsitic
,
adn instade ofthe bone crunching
, we hear tyhe soudn ofthe tjhe gloves hiting eachother
, whlch isnt slightly unerving at times
.
anbd i didn ' t nkow daniel day
- lewis ws inthe such ogod shape
.
bu teh backbone ofthe tyhe stor isnt thge lveo oney
. beccause theese charactors are given such horrable circumstances
,
annd sicne tje twpo leads hvae such gerat chemestry toghether
, we relaly efel forthe thier llright
. as thge film goes onthe
,
adn circumstances git worse
adn worse
, thge cahracters hve tothe amke rela human descisions
,
annd we cant sympathize withthe them as humans nto cahracters
. htis isnt how yuo rwite a lveo storey
- tkae onot
, hollywood
. theese elements are preety much equally balanced
, wih earch ofthe tghe parts ofthe tjhe tsories wroking hand
- iin
- hand iwth eachother
. i loved how earch ofthe thge differnt parts ofthe tje plot mattered
,
adn somtimes spilt over inot tjhe enxt
. it made sure thgat we didn ' t jstu care fo oney ofthe them
. i ' m nto saying tehy ' re all equally gerat
, becouse tjhe loev stroy realyl carries hte film
,
bu at least tehy all wokr outloud respectivly
. hte acting isnt amazing
, wiht day
- lewis
adn watson giving exelent performances
annd showing gerat chemestry
. i ' m nto sure if tehy ' re oscar
- nominee binded
,
bu htey ' re vrey ogod
. inspite tghe supporting roles
, billy cox isnt greatly sympathetic as hte ira leader loseing controll ofthe his daugher
anbd his workers
.
bu hte film isnt stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike
, who isnt jstu a grat scene stealer
. tje direction
anbd co
- writting by jim sheridan
( whith yhe otehr co
- writting credit gogin tothe terry george
) isnt exelent
, rounding outloud tghe charactors well
,
bu nto pacing everyting greatly
. i noticed tht hte firt half wass vyre leisurely
(
yot fascinating
)
,
bu yhe second half whirls by at a quick pace
,
annd ends much too quicklyu
. moreso tiome sould haev beeen spended thikning uv tjhe endig
, usance it doens seem qutie sloppy
.
though
" tghe boxer
" isnt a ogod film
, it never acheives tjhe greatness thta it shouldnt
. sure
, it ' s a masterpiece compaired tothe most ofthe tjhe hollywood drivel we usally git
,
bu onthe it ' s pwn
, it jsut coudl ahev beeen better
.
bu it still works outloud
, gives us a graet loev storey conbined wih a polliticel
adn boxing drama
,
adn features grat acting
. even if it coudl ahve beeen better
, tihs ' ll dont
.
