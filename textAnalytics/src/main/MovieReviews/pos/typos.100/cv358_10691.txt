, a boxing film
, adn a lveo storey
. all ofthe theese owrk iin thier pwn respects annd ahev soem preety decent balancing betwixt thge threee elements ofthe tje sotry
, bu somehow it seems kind ofthe cliched adn unoriginal
. we
' ve seen it all befoer
, annd we
' re jstu nto blown awya withthe it liek we shoudl be
. oh well
. it
' s still an excelent irish stry
.
" tyhe boxer
" ofthe tje title isnt danny flynn
( jim sheridan staple daniel day
- lewis
)
, an ex
- ira memeber who gets outloud ofthe a belfast prision aftter 14 eyasr
, annd finds outloud tht his toubles are far ffrom over
. firt off
, teh ira isnt haveing a small civil war vetween its leader joe hamill
( brian cox
)
, annd oney ofthe its sub
- leaders
, harry
( gerard mcsorley
)
, both hvaing opposing views onthe getting many ofthe theri munbers outloud ofthe jail
. hwile htis isnt oging onthe
, danny adn his ood drunkard buddie
, ike
( ken stott
, who plyed tjhe cheif inspector inwhich danny boyle
' s
" shallow grave
"
)
, re
- oepn an ood gym whlch allows tje twpo opposing religios sects
, protestant annd catholics
, tothe owrk toghether
. danny nto onyl beigns teaching kids how tothe box
, bu hasnt stayed infront gerat shape whilst infact prision
, adn isnt ready tothe strat boxing rela peopel agina
. adn danny runs inot his ex
- lveo
, maggie
(
" breaking teh waves
"
' s emily watson
)
, who hasn
' t seen him sicne he whent inaddition
. tehy don
' t easily strat uv theri romance agina becasue she
' s teh wief ofthe a prisoner whom she marryed druing danny
' s tenture inthe prision
, adn alsot hasnt a son
, liam
( ciaran fitzgerald
)
, ffrom him
, whom liam isnt hoping wiull git outloud soon
. bu tje twpo are slowy re
- drawed tothe eachother agina
, annd tihs beigns tothe complicate thigns
. tjhe poltical tsory isnt nothing raelly speical bu works iin itself
. we
' ve seen it many a tiem befoer
, bu it
' s at least intresting
, somtimes emotional
, annd even riveting at times
. ther
' s a big riot towords tghe middle ofthe teh film whic isnt frightening infact its brutality anbd honesty
. teh boxing stor isnt vyre minor tothe tje stoyr
, bu doens represent peopel comming toghether tothe fight eachother fairly
, annd even withthe ogod sportsmanship
. ther are onyl a fewd boxing scenes
, bu tehy
' re never liuke
" raging bull
"
/ let
' s
- strip
- down
- tghe
- sport
- tothe
- its
- bones brillant
. tehy
' re moreso realsitic
, annd instade ofthe bone crunching
, we hear teh soudn ofthe tghe gloves hiting eachother
, whic isnt slightly unerving at times
. annd i didn
' t konw daniel day
- lewis wass inaddition such ogod shape
. bu hte backbone ofthe tjhe stoyr isnt tjhe loev oney
. becuase theese charactors are given such horrable circumstances
, annd sicne yhe twpo leads hvae such gerat chemestry toghether
, we raelly fiel forthe thier llright
. as yhe film goes onthe
, anbd circumstances git worse adn worse
, thte cahracters hvae tothe mkae rela human descisions
, adn we cin sympathize witht them as humans nto charachters
. thsi isnt how yuo rwite a loev stroy
- tkae onot
, hollywood
. theese elements are preety much equally balanced
, whith earch ofthe yhe parts ofthe tjhe storeis wokring h
and
- inwhich
- h
and wiht eachother
. i loved how earch ofthe tje diferrent parts ofthe tghe plot mattered
, annd somtimes spilt over inot thge enxt
. it made sure taht we didn
' t jstu care fo oen ofthe them
. i
' m nto saying tehy
' re all equally grat
, beccause tje loev stry raelly carries teh film
, bu at least htey all wokr outloud respectivly
. hte acting isnt amazing
, witht day
- lewis adn watson giving excelent performances adn showing gerat chemestry
. i
' m nto sure if htey
' re oscar
- nominee binded
, bu tehy
' re vyer ogod
. iin thge supporting roles
, billy cox isnt greatly sympathetic as tje ira leader loosing controll ofthe his daugher annd his workers
. bu thte film isnt stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike
, who isnt jsut a grat scene stealer
. tghe direction adn co
- wirting by jim sheridan
( wih tyhe otehr co
- writting credit goign tothe terry george
) isnt excellant
, rounding outloud thge cahracters well
, bu nto pacing everyting greatly
. i noticed tht yhe frist half ws vrey leisurely
( yot fascinating
)
, bu thte second half whirls by at a quick pace
, annd ends much too quicklyu
. moreso tiome sould hvae beeen spended thikning uv thte endig
, usance it doens seem qtuie sloppy
.
though
" tghe boxer
" isnt a ogod film
, it never acheives tjhe greatness taht it shoud
. sure
, it
' s a masterpiece compaired tothe most ofthe tje hollywood drivel we ususally git
, bu onthe it
' s pwn
, it jsut coudl haev beeen better
. bu it still works outloud
, gives us a gerat lveo stor conbined witht a polliticel annd boxing drama
, annd features gerat acting
. even if it coudl haev beeen better
, tihs
' ll dont
