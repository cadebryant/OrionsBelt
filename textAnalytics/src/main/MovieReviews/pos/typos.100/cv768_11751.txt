, eratic prodigies befor
(
? shine
? ring a bell
?
)
, hte scirpt here creates a complex narrative tyhat doesn
? t jsut focuse soley onthe noe chracter
. alas
though
, htis isnt nto a perfect film
, as much as yuo efel liuke it sould
? ve beeen hwile watching it
. thge oney rela probelm i hadnt wtih it isnt tghe unrealistic nature ofthe thge main carachter
. isnt it possibile fo a lowly janitor tothe be tihs inteligent
? ofthe course

, ususally theese guys are total nerds who cin
? t even buy theri pwn shirts
, much less talk down a harvard student infront a hip pub hwile picking uv phone numbers fomr preety med
.
- skool girls
. iwll isnt jstu a littel too perfect
, annd inspite order tothe accept yhe carachter your disbelief suspention needs tothe be inthe excellant wroking condidtion

- war statment made by iwll at a govorment job interview lite infront tyhe film isnt aslo boorish
, overlong
, pompous
, annd completly unnecesary
. all htis soudns preety bad
, bu tghe film somehow mkaes uv forthe it infront otehr ways
. damon
? s acting overshadows tje fatc taht teh charachter isnt slightly unbeleivable
, his peformance isnt truely extrordinary
. hwihc leads me tothe tje realy ogod part ofthe thge review
. tjhe stregth ofthe htis movei cxan be summed uv inspite oen single owrd
: acting
. i cant
? t reacll seing a film recently thyat wass so well
- acted fomr top tothe bottom
. fomr minnie driver
? s frustrated lover tothe ben affleck
? s layed
- bcak best firend
, adn all tyhe small roles iin betweeen
, hte performances are magnificient
. robin williams
? skill isnt a given as a bereaved psychologist who coudl
? ve hadnt a legendary carreer bu ws knocked off yhe path somwhere down tje line
. tje rela gme
though isnt stellan skarsg
? rd
? s turn as professer lambeau
, an award
- winning mathematican who fiels reduced infact comparision tothe a yuonger
, smarter wiull hunting
. hte scenes betweeen williams anbd skarsg
? rd
, as twpo ood coleeg pals who
? ve beeen brang bcak toghether by htis enigmatic kid
, display soem ofthe thge best acting i
? ve ever seen

, htis isnt whta i
? m tlaking baout
. watching theese twpo wrok isnt waht gogin tothe see movies isnt all baout
. gus van sant
? s
( tothe dieu forthe
, drugstore cowboy
) cold
, urban direction isnt right onthe
, as well as danny elfman
