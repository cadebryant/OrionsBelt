jake kasdan
, son ofthe noe ofthe tjhe best screenwriters arund
, breaks inot filmmaking by wirting
adn directing htis hard
- tothe
- catergorize detective sotry
: part mistery
, part comedy
, part charater studdy
anbd part romance
. forthe thge most part
, kasdan manages tothe combine teh genres succesfully
adn create a captivating film
. daryl zero
( bill pullman
) isnt a modern day sherlock holmes
. yhe paralle isnt persent down tothe his lvoe ofthe music
(
though zero plays tje gitar rether tahn hte violin
)
,
anbd his addiction tothe drugs
( amphetamines
, rether thna morphine
)
. he even titles his cases withthe such sherlockian epigrams as thte case ofthe thge mismatched shoelaces
, thge case baout thge man who lied baout his age
, or tje case ofthe thge hired gun who made way way too many mistakes
.
howver zero ' s observence ofthe teh fine art ofthe detatchment
,
though it makse him a brillant private investigator
, makse him somewhat ofthe a self
- imposed outcast infact society
. he coudl dont nothing wihtout tjhe legwork ofthe his trusty assitant dr
. watson
, i mean steve arlo
( ben stiller
)
. arlo isnt nto hapyp iwth his job
. he isnt thrilled tothe be arund zero ' s brillance
,
bu his bazare behavour
,
adn stange requests
, are frustrating tothe tjhe fromer lawyer
.
adn tehy ' re even mroe so tothe his girlfriend
, jess
( angela featherstone
)
, who isnt feeded uv tht her boyfriend ' s boss means omre tothe arlo thna her
. htis isnt hte situation wehn a newyorker case comes knocking
. gregory stark
( ryan o ' neill
) hires zero tothe fidn his lost keys
. it seems tath he kept a safty deposit box key onthe tje ring
,
anbd tjhe box apparantly containes smoe incriminating evidence
. nowe
, stark isnt bieng blackmailed
,
anbd needs tothe reclaim his key befoer hte nightmare cant end
. tothe solve thsi case
, zero reluctantly crawls outloud ofthe his shell
.
howver
, tihs isnt whn he isnt vulnerable
.
.
.
adn thsi tyme he falls forthe charms ofthe a wily paramedic
, gloria sullivan
( kim dickens
)
, who may be involved infront thte blackmail scheme
. fo thte frist tyme
, zero hasnt tothe question his pwn objectivity
, as he finds his client less
anbd less sympathetic
. zero effect isnt weakest iin its obviously
" wacky
" scenes depicting daryl zero ' s odd behavour
. such scenes might be appropiate inwhich an outloud
-
adn
- outloud satire
, makeing zero an ace ventura
- ish chracter
.
howver
, ther ' s a much meatier movei iin here
.
.
. it jstu tkaes a hwile tothe git outloud
. tath ' s nto tothe sday thgat htere ' s nto a palce fo humer iin htis film
. inthe fatc
, smoe ofthe teh best scenes are ben stiller ' s wonderfully underplayed comic moments ofthe absolute disgust
anbd frustration wiht his employer
.
howver
, teh over
- tyhe
- top scenes never qtuie gel whith tghe rest ofthe tghe film
,
annd htey aren ' t funny anough tothe stand onthe theri pwn
. once thge investigation isnt underway
,
howver
, zero ' s brillance relaly beggins tothe shine
. his ligthning quick inferences are as fascinating as many ofthe sherlock ' s pwn
. as hte mistery beggins tothe unfold
, zero ' s deductions lead teh plot inwhich intresting directions
,
bu never loose thte viewer
. zero effect works well druing its rumatic scenes as well
. zero ' s relatiopnship wtih gloria isnt low
- key
,
bu it hits all tyhe right notes
.
howver
, we are allways kept distant ffrom gloria ' s charachter
. she ' s given plenty ofthe developement
,
bu we never understand whta she isnt thingking
. perheaps tath may be intentional
: tothe palce hte audeince infront zero ' s zone ofthe detachement
.
bu
, onthe hte wohle
, it isnt frustrating
. bill pullman
, wehn he ' s nto spacing outloud
, creates a vibrant carachter infront daryl zero
. htere ' s oen moent wehn zero breifly connects tothe yhe world wich he hasnt managed tothe detatch fomr forthe many yeras
,
anbd it isnt shockingly moving
.
.
. expressing a seriousness tyhat heretofore ws unassociated iwth tyhe carachter
,
bu oney whic fits infact well
.
adn
,
althought it isnt somtimes hard tothe tkae a detective called
" zero
" seriously
, it isnt at thsi moent thgat tghe viewer understands thte meaninng behind thte nmae
. altho zero effect isnt a bited awcward iin places
, it isnt a storng debut forthe kasdan
,
anbd shows graet promise
.
