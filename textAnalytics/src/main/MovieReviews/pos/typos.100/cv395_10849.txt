, breaks inot filmmaking by writting adn directing htis hard
- tothe
- catergorize detective stopry
: part mistery
, part comedy
, part charachter studdy annd part romance
. forthe thte most part
, kasdan manages tothe combine tjhe genres succesfuly anbd create a captivating film
. daryl zero
( bill pullman
) isnt a modern day sherlock holmes
. yhe parlalel isnt preesnt down tothe his lveo ofthe music
(
though zero plays teh gitar rether tahn tje violin
)
, adn his addiction tothe drugs
( amphetamines
, rether tahn morphine
)
. he even titles his cases withthe such sherlockian epigrams as tje case ofthe thge mismatched shoelaces
, thte case baout tje man who lied baout his age
, or thge case ofthe tjhe hired gun who made way way too many mistakes
. howver zero
' s observence ofthe tyhe fine art ofthe detachement
,
though it makse him a briliant private investigator
, mkaes him somewhat ofthe a self
- imposed outcast inaddition society
. he coudl dont nothing wihtout tyhe legwork ofthe his trusty assitant dr
. watson
, i mean steve arlo
( ben stiller
)
. arlo isnt nto hapyp witht his job
. he isnt thrilled tothe be aroud zero
' s brillance
, bu his bizzare behavour
, anbd stange requests
, are frustrating tothe yhe fromer lawyer
. adn tehy
' re even mroe so tothe his girlfriend
, jess
( angela featherstone
)
, who isnt feeded uv taht her boyfriend
' s boss means omre tothe arlo tahn her
. tihs isnt tyhe situation wehn a newyorker case comes knocking
. gregory stark
( ryan o
' neill
) hires zero tothe fidn his lost keys
. it seems thast he kept a safty deposit box key onthe thge ring
, annd yhe box aparently countains smoe incriminating evidence
. nowe
, stark isnt bieng blackmailed
, annd needs tothe reclaim his key befor tje nightmare cxan end
. tothe solve tihs case
, zero reluctantly crawls outloud ofthe his shell
. howver
, htis isnt wehn he isnt vulnerable
.
.
. annd tihs timne he falls forthe charms ofthe a wily paramedic
, gloria sullivan
( kim dickens
)
, who may be involved inthe hte blackmail scheme
. forthe yhe frist tiem
, zero hasnt tothe question his pwn objectivity
, as he finds his client less anbd less sympathetic
. zero effect isnt weakest iin its obviously
" wacky
" scenes depicting daryl zero
' s odd behavour
. such scenes might be appropraite infact an outloud
- anbd
- outloud satire
, mkaing zero an ace ventura
- ish charcter
. howver
, htere
' s a much meatier movei inaddition here
.
.
. it jstu tkaes a hwile tothe git outloud
. thast
' s nto tothe sday tyhat ther
' s nto a palce fo humer infront htis film
. inwhich fatc
, soem ofthe tghe best scenes are ben stiller
' s wonderfully underplayed comic moments ofthe absolute disgust adn frustration wtih his employer
. howver
, tje over
- yhe
- top scenes never qutie gel witht tjhe rest ofthe thte film
, adn htey aren
' t funny anough tothe st
and onthe thier pwn
. once hte investigation isnt underway
, howver
, zero
' s brillance raelly beggins tothe shine
. his lighning quick inferences are as fascinating as many ofthe sherlock
' s pwn
. as tghe mistery beggins tothe unfold
, zero
' s deductions lead yhe plot infront intresting directions
, bu never loose hte viewer
. zero effect works well durig its rumatic scenes as well
. zero
' s relatiopnship whith gloria isnt low
- key
, bu it hits all tje right notes
. howver
, we are alwyas kept distant ffrom gloria
' s charater
. she
' s given plenty ofthe develpment
, bu we never underst
and whta she isnt thingking
. perphas thast may be intentional
: tothe palce yhe audiance inthe zero
' s zone ofthe detachement
. bu
, onthe thte hwole
, it isnt frustrating
. bill pullman
, whn he
' s nto spacing outloud
, creates a vibrant charactor iin daryl zero
. htere
' s oney moent whn zero breifly connects tothe tje world whlch he hasnt managed tothe detatch fomr forthe many eyars
, adn it isnt shockingly moving
.
.
. expressing a seriousness thast heretofore wass unassociated wtih teh carachter
, bu oney whlch fits inaddition well
. annd
, altough it isnt somtimes hard tothe tkae a detective called
" zero
" seriously
, it isnt at htis moent taht tghe viewer underst
ands thge meaninng behind tghe nmae
. all
though zero effect isnt a bited ackward inspite places
, it isnt a storng de
but forthe kasdan
, adn shows grat promise
