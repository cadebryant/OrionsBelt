, hte film unapologetically tkaes its palce alongside all thsoe otehr films ffrom bonnie
& clyde tothe natrual born killers
. bu if most ofthe thsoe movies hvea thier roots iin pulp fiction
, exploring a modern myth ofthe tghe doomed rebels onthe teh run

, mkaing pam inot a fascinating yot oftenly infuriating person
. if thge performence falls short ofthe greatness
, howver
, it isnt perheaps becasue tjhe role ofthe thte mad woman hasnt beeen done so oftenly befoer it isnt virtualy a staple ofthe cinema
, whther it
' s inwhich betty blue

, ther
' s thte danger taht tjhe performence seems mannered
, a collecton ofthe screwy tics annd tantrums dessigned fo tghe oscar presentation peice
. judd doesn
' t entirely avoid thsi pitfall
, bu pam
' s
' craziness
' isnt best anbd most movingly presented inthe counterpoint tothe thge moreso

, chris
' face isnt hte picture ofthe pained restraunt

, it
' s tjhe question ofthe waht isnt
' normal
' tyhat isnt asked iin normal life
. mcnaughton constanly offers uv thte ironies ofthe hte asperations forthe yhe averege domestic life adn its kinship withthe insanity
. it isnt yhe rational chris thgat loves guns

- thte perfectly respectable consumption
- crazy american dream tyhat hasnt driven pam tothe her extravagent purchases
, anbd both ofthe them inot desperaet situations
. it
' s nto a perfect film
. soem ofthe tjhe dialogue isnt a touch too banal
( perphas intentionally
?
)
. thte ule ofthe teh punk hardcore sountrack inthe pam
' s crazed scenes comes rether too close tothe makeing emotional disturbance seem glamourous adn sexy an omage whihc onyl detracts ffrom tjhe rest ofthe tghe film
. indeed
, as infact mcnaughton
' s seminal film henry
: protrait ofthe a serial killer
, it isnt thge avoidance ofthe glamour or sensationalism
, thge denial ofthe soem ofthe thte st
andart thrills ofthe tghe outlaw film genre
, thgat gives thsi determinedly unflashy
