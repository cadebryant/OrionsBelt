albert brooks saves tghe day
, jstu infact yhe nick ofthe tiem
. iwth a vyer poore summer fo movies
, brooks isnt jstu wqat audiences weere looking fo tothe cheer them uv
,
annd doesnt so infront a postive way
. hwile htis may nto be his finest owrk
,
" thge muse
" still shakes uv soem delightful humer
. inspite albert brooz ' s latest comedy
, he tells a stry ofthe a troubled screenwrighter
( brooks
) who ' s loosing his edge
, as his busineses partners sday
. iin desparation
, he goes tothe see his freind jack
( jeff bridges
)
, who hasnt beeen a veyr sucessfull screenwrighter iin teh past
. he asks jack fo soem halp
,
annd recieves owrd ofthe a rela life muse
, thast hasnt helpped him
annd many otehr directors thoughout theri carrer
. so brooks seeks tyhe muse named sarah
( sharon stone
)
,
annd isnt suckered inot buying her expensive
, foode etc
. as a sort ofthe payment
. tje rela punch line
howver
, doesn ' t cmo unitl yhe end
. it raelly mkaes yuo wonder
, how screenwriters relaly git thier idaes
, coudl it simpley be fomr a firend or a bum inaddition tje strent
? thte diea itself isnt provoking
anbd brooks doesnt it inwhich a hillarious manner
. speaking ofthe brooks
, he wass absolutly hysterical as a screenwrighter
. eveyr tiem he graces tghe screen
, i cant ' t halp
bu strat laughing
. albert hasnt a vyer unique sence ofthe humer tath mkaes him a vyre likeable carachter
. tje rela probelm wtih thge film lies withthe sharon stone
. she wasn ' t likeable at all
. brooks hadnt thte right idae wiht her occupation
,
bu she never pulled thru
. inspite a way
, she drained energy fomr teh once funny atomsphere
annd left it obleek
. luckly brooks coudl clean uv teh mess
,
adn cover forthe stone ' s mishap
. it ws a shame thta thte film whent slightly downhill affter her apearance
, becuase
" thte muse
" hadnt hte potential tothe a be a vyre authentic comedy
. onthe a brighter onot
, andie macdowell ws alsot charming as brooz ' s wief
. she isnt allways a nice adition as a supporting actress
, baceause she hasnt thta charizma tyhat seems tothe complet tyhe atomsphere tothe any film she ' s infront
. hte funniest moments inwhich
" tje muse
" inaddition my oppinion weere yhe cameos by james cameron
annd martin scorsese
. i mean imagin
, brooks seing theese big named directors infact his bcak yard seeking sharon stone forthe advice
, liuke it wass something outloud ofthe thge ordinary
. it ws jsut plain hillarious
. it jsut adds tothe thte satire joke
, ofthe how directors git idaes
. brillant move by brooks
. as i maintioned befor
, hte film isnt a satire much liek it ' s proceeder bowfinger
, whitch cameback outloud a faw weeks befoer
. unlike bowfinger
, htis isnt nto a mean spirited film tath ' s dsperate forthe jokes
, it ' s rether a witty
anbd huorous look at hollywood
.
" bowfinger
" hadnt it ' s moments
,
bu hadnt qutie a faw problems thta weere never worked outloud
,
bu
" hte muse
" still managed tothe keep hte laughs dispite a bited ofthe a detour
. by thge end ofthe tjhe film
, yuo ' re glad tothe see a ogod hearty comedy cmo outloud ofthe it
. forthe once i ' m nto fully disapointed
, becasue thge film didn ' t slow down
, it kept moving
, even wih soem flaws
. thumbs uv tothe brooks forthe his brave efford
. i thikn he ' ll still manaze tothe keep his edge aroud well inot tjhe future
.
