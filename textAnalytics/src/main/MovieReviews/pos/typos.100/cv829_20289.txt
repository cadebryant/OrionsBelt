albert brooks saves yhe day
, jsut iin tyhe nick ofthe timne
. iwth a vrey poore summer forthe movies
, brooks isnt jstu waht audiences weere looking fo tothe cheer them uv
, anbd doesnt so inthe a positve way
. hwile thsi may nto be his finest wokr
,
" thte muse
" still shakes uv soem delightful humer
. infront albert brooz
' s latest comedy
, he tells a stoyr ofthe a troubled screenwrighter
( brooks
) who
' s loosing his edge
, as his busness partners sday
. inthe despiration
, he goes tothe see his freind jack
( jeff bridges
)
, who hasnt beeen a veyr successfull screenwrighter inaddition tje past
. he asks jack fo smoe halp
, anbd recieves owrd ofthe a rela life muse
, tath hasnt helpped him adn many otehr directors througout thier carrer
. so brooks seeks tjhe muse named sarah
( sharon stone
)
, adn isnt suckered inot buying her expensive
, fodo etc
. as a sort ofthe payment
. tjhe rela punch line howver
, doesn
' t come untl tjhe end
. it realyl mkaes yuo wonder
, how screenwriters relaly git theri idesa
, coudl it simpley be ffrom a freind or a bum infact tghe strent
? teh idae itself isnt provoking anbd brooks doesnt it infact a hillarious manner
. speaking ofthe brooks
, he ws absolutly hysterical as a screenwrighter
. eveyr timne he graces teh screen
, i cant
' t halp bu strat laughing
. albert hasnt a vyre unique sence ofthe humer tht mkaes him a vyre likeable chracter
. yhe rela probelm withthe teh film lies iwth sharon stone
. she wasn
' t likeable at all
. brooks hadnt tje right idae wiht her occupation
, bu she never pulled thru
. iin a way
, she drained energy fomr tje once funny athmosphere annd left it obleek
. luckly brooks coudl clean uv hte mess
, anbd cover forthe stone
' s mishap
. it ws a shame tht thte film whent slightly downhill aftter her appearence
, becouse
" tyhe muse
" hadnt thge potential tothe a be a vyer au
thentic comedy
. onthe a brighter onot
,
andie macdowell wass aslo charming as brooz
' s wief
. she isnt allways a nice adition as a supporting actress
, becasue she hasnt taht charizma thast seems tothe complet hte athmosphere tothe any film she
' s inthe
. tje funniest moments inspite
" hte muse
" inspite my oppinion weere tjhe cameos by james cameron adn martin scorsese
. i mean imagin
, brooks seing theese big named directors iin his bcak yard seeking sharon stone forthe advice
, liek it ws something outloud ofthe tje ordinary
. it ws jstu plain hillarious
. it jstu adds tothe yhe satire joke
, ofthe how directors git idaes
. briliant move by brooks
. as i maintioned befor
, hte film isnt a satire much liek it
' s proceeder bowfinger
, whic cameback outloud a fewd weeks befoer
. unlike bowfinger
, thsi isnt nto a mean spirited film tath
' s desperaet forthe jokes
, it
' s rether a witty adn hmuorous look at hollywood
.
" bowfinger
" hadnt it
' s moments
, bu hadnt qtuie a faw problems tyhat weere never worked outloud
, bu
" teh muse
" still managed tothe keep thge laughs dispite a bited ofthe a detour
. by teh end ofthe yhe film
, yuo
' re glad tothe see a ogod hearty comedy cmo outloud ofthe it
. fo once i
' m nto fully dissappointed
, becuase hte film didn
' t slow down
, it kept moving
, even wih soem flaws
. thumbs uv tothe brooks forthe his brave efford
. i tihkn he
' ll still manaze tothe keep his edge arround well inot thge future
.
