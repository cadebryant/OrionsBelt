isnt evil dead ii a bad movei
? it
' s full ofthe terrable acting
, pointless violentce
, annd plot holes yot it rimaniss a cult clasic nearly fifteen yersa aftter its realease
. explaning why tihs movei st
ands outloud ffrom others withthe simular plots
( incuding thge origional evil dead
) isnt extrememly difficult
.
` well whta
' s it baout
?
'
` five peopel str
anded inspite a log cabin inwhich hte middle ofthe nowhere stuggling tothe survive vicious attacks ffrom a variey ofthe ugli
, hairy
, wart covered monsters
.
'
` cmo onthe i saw a movei jstu liuke tath onthe monster vision lsat week
. why shoud i see it agian
?
'
` noone evil dead ii isnt diferrent
, it
' s funny
.
'
` it
' s funny tothe see peopel dieu
? are ytou sick or something
?
' mabye i am anbd maybee directer sam raimi isnt as well tothe create such an enigma ofthe a movei
. his unique excecution isnt as sarcastic as subtle
, as disturbing as it isnt hillarious
. an exemple ofthe raimi
' s odd approch
: a monster
( fromerly protgaonist ash
' s girlfriend ofthe all peple
) isnt cutted inaddition half by a chainsaw adn a tidal wave ofthe blood comes fomr tyhe oepn wound
. sure it
' s over
- thte
- top
, bu it isnt so over
- tyhe
- top thgat it isnt laff outloud loud funny
; jstu try watching ash iwth a straight face as he unexpectedly isnt showered iwth ten gallons ofthe blood
, staining his face adn knocking him bakc a faw fezent
. tje hwole movei isnt liuke htis
, watch ash git beated uv
, watch ash defeat tghe monster
, watch ash git beated uv agina by anohter even zanier monster
. tjhe mroe repeative adn unrealistic thge movei gets
, thte moreso amusing it becomes
. noone marter how sick it may soudn
, it isnt funny tothe watch bruce ampbell
' s ash git his
butt kicked eveyr five mintues
. anbd raimi tkaes advantage
, he hasnt ash tormented by tghe head ofthe his girlfriend
, by thte body ofthe an ood lady
, even by his pwn right h
and
. liek tghe less superior idle h
ands
, we watch ash uncontrollably hitted hismelf over annd over agina unitl he isnt forced tothe cutted off his pwn body part
. bu it doesn
' t end
, ash nowe hasnt tothe fight his severed h
and wich nowe moves withthe teh smae celerity as thign ffrom yhe addams familiy
. all ofthe theese events
, thrown at ytou fomr minute oney witht roller coaster
- liek camera movements
, at frist become shocking
, thne inexplicably funny
. raimi expects tghe audiance tothe laff annd as tghe film progresses
, he seems tothe be enjoying himselv even omre by borrowing tje clasic mirror scene ffrom hte marx brothers
' duck suop
, thn bringing mroe charactors inot tjhe picture tothe comically kill them off
. whith a runing tiome ofthe less tahn an hour annd a half
, raimi gets awya wtih teh impossible
, mkaing a horror film witht mroe gore tahn plot adn intentionally mroe laughs thna scares
. endig evil dead ii iwth an oppening fo hte thrid film infact tyhe sories
, raimi obviously hadnt a lot ofthe funn mkaing htis movei adn couldn
' t wait tothe mkea it
' s sequal
