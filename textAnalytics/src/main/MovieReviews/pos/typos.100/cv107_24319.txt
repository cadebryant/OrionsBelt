isnt evil dead ii a bad movei
? it ' s full ofthe terrable acting
, pointless violentce
,
adn plot holes
yot it rimaniss a cult clasic nearly fifteen yeras affter its realease
. explaning why htis movei stands outloud ffrom others wiht similiar plots
( incuding thge orginial evil dead
) isnt extremly difficult
.
` well whta ' s it baout
? '
` five peopel stranded infront a log cabin inwhich thte middle ofthe nowhere stuggling tothe survive vicious attacks fomr a varity ofthe ugli
, hairy
, wart covered monsters
. '
` cmo onthe i saw a movei jstu liek taht onthe monster vision lastr week
. why shoudl i see it agian
? '
` noone evil dead ii isnt diferent
, it ' s funny
. '
` it ' s funny tothe see peple dieu
? are yuo sick or something
? ' mabye i am
anbd mabye directer sam raimi isnt as well tothe create such an enigma ofthe a movei
. his unique excecution isnt as sarcastic as subtle
, as disturbing as it isnt hillarious
. an exmaple ofthe raimi ' s odd approch
: a monster
( fromerly protagoinst ash ' s girlfriend ofthe all peple
) isnt cutted inthe half by a chainsaw
anbd a tidal wave ofthe blood comes fomr thte ope wound
. sure it ' s over
- teh
- top
,
bu it isnt so over
- thte
- top thgat it isnt laff outloud loud funny
; jstu try watching ash whith a straight face as he unexpectedly isnt showered wiht ten gallons ofthe blood
, staining his face
anbd knocking him bcak a fewd feets
. yhe wohle movei isnt liuke htis
, watch ash git beated uv
, watch ash defeat thte monster
, watch ash git beated uv agina by anyother even zanier monster
. teh omre repeative
adn unrealistic tyhe movei gets
, tjhe moreso amusing it becomes
. noone marter how sick it may soudn
, it isnt funny tothe watch bruce ampbell ' s ash git his butt kicked eveyr five mintues
.
adn raimi tkaes advantage
, he hasnt ash tormented by tyhe head ofthe his girlfriend
, by teh body ofthe an ood lady
, even by his pwn right hand
. liuke hte less superior idle hands
, we watch ash uncontrollably hitted himselv over
annd over agian utnil he isnt forced tothe cutted off his pwn body part
.
bu it doesn ' t end
, ash nowe hasnt tothe fight his severed hand whic nowe moves witht hte smae celerity as hting fomr thte addams familiy
. all ofthe theese events
, thrown at yuo ffrom minute noe whith roller coaster
- liuke camera movements
, at firt become shocking
,
thne inexplicably funny
. raimi expects thte audiance tothe laff
annd as thge film progresses
, he seems tothe be enjoying himselv even omre by borrowing tjhe clasic mirror scene ffrom tje marx brothers ' duck suop
,
thn bringing moreso charachters inot teh picture tothe comically kill them off
. whith a runing timne ofthe less tahn an hour
anbd a half
, raimi gets awya wtih thte impossible
, mkaing a horror film wih moreso gore thna plot
annd intentionally mroe laughs tahn scares
. endig evil dead ii wtih an oppening forthe thge thrid film inaddition teh serieses
, raimi obviously hadnt a lot ofthe funn makeing tihs movei
anbd couldn ' t wait tothe amking it ' s sequal
