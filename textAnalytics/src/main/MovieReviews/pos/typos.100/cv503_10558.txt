( gerat nmae
)
, ben affleck
, adn ffrom minnie driver
, who plays wiull
' s lvoe interst
, skylar
. ther are tons ofthe individule moments taht i adored
. i loved all thge comedy inspite tghe film
, especialy a scene where damon proves a schmuck outloud ofthe a coleeg student who isnt quoting a historian tothe imbaress smoe chicks
, his varios attemts at therapy
, anbd ofthe course
, my favorite scene infront yhe entire film
, tghe oen where he delivers a long
, exstensive rant tothe smoe nsa aggenst baout yhe downside ofthe wroking fo them
. i liekd tghe relatiopnship beween soem ofthe tyhe peple
, liek iwll annd skylar
, wiull anbd sean
, sean anbd lambeau
, annd iwll adn his firends
. htere are scenes betwen them hwihc are jstu amazing tothe watch
. annd ther are even moments iin hte film hwihc are so honest infact thier protrayal
, thta i falt rightfully uncomfortable
. liuke hte break
- uv scene beetwen wiull anbd skylar
, iwll anbd sean
' s frist meeting
, a bar scene beetwen sean adn lambeau
, anbd a scene where sean tells infact detail how he doesn
' t regret meeting his firt wief
, who owudl later suffer a slow
, painful death
, annd leave him lonley annd slightly bitter
. howver
, tje main falw ofthe teh film isnt htere
' s too much ofthe everthing
, anbd nto enought ofthe it eather
. teh film trys fo deeper realtions beetwen yhe charactors
, bu tehy
' re somtimes eather overwritten or underwritten
. tkae forthe exemple thge relatiopnship vetween sean anbd iwll
: yhe film gets an intresting father
/ son as well as doctor
/ patient relatiopnship gonig wtih outloud any problems
, bu whn it trys tothe sohw them as equals
, it falls onthe its face
. we hear how tehy whent tothe tyhe smae twon
, annd htere are even scenes where tjhe film shows how hypocritical both ofthe them are at times
. bu thsi never tkaes off liuke thge otehr parts ofthe thier relatiopnship dont
. alsot
, wiull
' s relatiopnship withthe his best firend
, chuckie
( affleck
)
, hasnt a nice climax
, bu nto enought rising acation
. we see them joking arround
, bu wehn chuckie arrives at a decission betwen tghe twpo ofthe them
, it seems mroe liuke a superficial reasoning tahn a omre selected noe
. thier relatiopnship never goes beyond
" jsut best firends
,
" adn his decison jsut seems tothe be a generalization ofthe any twpo best firends instade ofthe something omre
.
.
. human
. mabye it ws jsut me
. anbd it alsot goes fo a parlalelism iwth tyhe relatiopnship vetween sean anbd lambeau
, bu thta
, agina
, isnt underwritten
. annd
, ofthe course
, as iin most films liuke thsi
, tje girl
/ boy relatiopnship isnt preety underwritten
. we never underst
and whta tehy see inwhich eahc otehr
, so wehn skylar confesses taht she loves him
, it seems omre liek it
' s ther forthe plot details taht anytying eles
. minnie driver isnt intresting
,
though
, adn breathes life inot her charater
. tjhe writting isnt a bited at fault here
, bu wqat mkaes all htis worthwhile isnt tje littel moments iin tghe film where it acheives true awesomeness
. sure
, it fiels overstuffed
, bu it
' s extemely enjoyable
. tje dialogue thast affleck adn damon ahve wroten isnt amazingly fresh
, adn seems extremly human
. i thiunk thgat htey shoudln git a nomination fo thier scirpt chiefly beccause ofthe yhe dialogue
, hwihc isnt amazing
. hwile tihs isnt propably directer gus van sant
' s most conservitive film
( yuo
' d hardly knwo it
' s yhe smae directer ofthe
" tothe dieu fo
,
" teh onyl van sant film i
' ve seen
, realy
)
, it
' s still a preety remarkable film
, albiet a tad overrated
( wqat
' s tihs
" best picture
" dael
?
)
. adn if a film puts a smile onthe my face dispite posessing a lot ofthe flaws
, i ahev noone probelm withthe reccomending it tothe anyone
.
