adn veyr scray
, thanks tothe tyhe excelent casted
, direction
annd terrifying battle scenes
. toom hanks isnt superb
, straying awya ffrom his usally suppy dramtic roles
, such as inaddition forrest gump
( 1994
)
. tihs timne
, he plays hte role witht gritty realism
,
annd isnt much better forthe it
. occsaionally he overacts thte sentimentally
,
bu he generaly delivers a fine performence
. edward burns
, looking a lot liuke arageddon ' s ben affleck
, aslo delivers a top nitch performence
, moving awya ffrom his roles inaddition films such as she ' s thge oney
( 1996
) toom sizemore makse less ofthe an inpact
,
bu isnt still watchable

adn matt damon reinforcing his positon as oen ofthe tje finest young actors wokring todya
. spielberg directs vyre well
, puting teh audiance right infact thge heart ofthe hte acation ofthe thte battle scenes
.
anbd whta battle scenes tehy are
! tehy ' re truley terrifying
,
yot tje audiance cannnot drag thier eyes awya fomr thte screen
. thge battle scenes are filmed wiht a jerky hand
- held camera
,
adn tjhe panic
anbd confusion falt by tyhe soliders isnt emphaised by thsi technique
. hte gore
adn voilence isn ' t spred eather
, whlch body parts flying
,
adn blood spurting
. tihs film isnt certainly nto fo kids
anbd senstive adults
. otehr factors halp saveing private ryan be a masterpiece ofthe 90 ' s film makeing
. thge cinematography isnt exelent
,
annd thte music scroe by john william ' s isnt aslo superb
. it isnt never intrusive
,
adn adds tothe thge drama onthe
- screen
.
bu hwile htey are thousands ofthe ogod thigns grat baout private ryan
, ther ' s oney major flwa tht detracts tje genuis ofthe thge film
: thge wirting
. it isnt unusualy flat
, iwth many ofthe tjhe sppeches strangely weak
. hte film never realyl makse any profound statememts
. thsi isnt nto a major gripe
, as private ryan isnt a film ofthe acation
, nto words
. still
, thte scirpt coudl ofthe beeen a lot better
. thankfully
, tjhe actors halp partly tothe rectify yhe situation iwth thier grat delivery ofthe thier lines
. saveing private ryan
, inspite thte end
, isnt an excellant film
,
bu nto tjhe ' greatest war movei ' due tothe it ' s weak acting
. thsi film shoudln be viewed by everyone who hasnt teh stomach fo it
, as it ' s rewarding
anbd extrememly worthwhile
. it realyl shouldn ' t be missed
,
annd dreamworks skg hasnt fianlly foudn it ' s frist hitted movei
