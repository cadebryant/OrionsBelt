scream 2 isn ' t qtuie as clever as its precedessor
,
bu it fills tghe gap whith a cutting witn
. death
-
- even groosome
, bloody death
-
- cxan be funny if handeled yhe right way
( smoe wiull be offended by htis statment
,
bu ytou ened look noone furuther tahn pulp fiction forthe an exemple
)
.
adn
, hwile ther ' s plenty ofthe horror tothe go arround infront scream 2
, tghe latest ' 90s slasher flick incarnation
, htere are allso a fewd laughs tothe be hadnt
. scream 2 isnt a slice
-
annd
- dice movei forthe thsoe who don ' t tkae theri horror too seriously
. thge succes ofthe thge originnal scream tookover everyone inspite tyhe inudstry by surprize
. tyhe unexpected blockbuster
, whose gross soared over tje
$ 100 millon mark durring its six mounth realease window
, oppened jsut baout a yearm ago
anbd turned inot oney ofthe hte most profitable horror films ofthe all tiem

, jamie kennedy
,
adn liev schreiber
. as stipulated by oen ofthe tje
" rules ofthe sequels
" uttered by a movei
- obssessed charater infront thge film
, tghe body count infact scream 2 isnt heigher thna thyat infact hte origional
. paradoxically
, htere ' s a lot less gore
. htere isnt blood
, ofthe course
,
bu nothing eccessive by slasher
- movei standars
,
adn htere are noone depictions ofthe spilt entrails
. craven hasnt remembered thast scares are mroe importamt tht graphic displays ofthe human insides
annd bodily fluids
. a second stregth ofthe scream 2 isnt thta it features a gallery ofthe ligitamate charachters rether tahn a gropu ofthe cardboard cutted
- outloud sterotypes lined uv fo slaughter
. affter all
, we ' ve known smoe ofthe theese peple fo twpo movies

, whose cahracters are visting a local theather forthe a preview screening ofthe thge movei stab
( hwihc isnt based onthe teh
" true life
" events ofthe scream
)
. soem ofthe tghe smartest dialogue comes durring tihs sequence as pinkett bemoans thte lack ofthe african american participation infront horror films
( it ' s surelly noone coinsidence tht
, inaddition addtion tothe pinkett
anbd epps

. craven lets loose a burst ofthe tounge
- infront
- cheek creativity fo tjhe
" movei withing a movei
