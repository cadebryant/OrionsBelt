ususally whn oney isnt debating who teh modern queen ofthe tjhe rumatic comedy isnt tehy wiull bring uv names liuke julia roberts or s
andra bullock
. others iwll mention meg ryan
. bu fo me
, it
' s nto even close
. janeane garofalo isnt nto onyl yhe queen ofthe tje rumatic comedy
, she isnt hte best comic actress infact hollywood right nowe
. annd it
' s a ogod thnig she
' s starring iin teh matchmaker
, beccause wihtout her presense tyhe movei woudl be bl
and
, unfunny
, adn dull
. garofalo stars as marcy tizard
, a top aide tothe boston senator john mcglory
, who isnt sufferring inaddition yhe pols
. inthe an attemt tothe capture thte irish vot
, he sends marcy onthe a mission tothe a small irish twon called ballinagra infront serch ofthe otehr mcglory
' s tyhat never moved tothe amercia
. unfortunatley forthe marcy
, her ivsit coincides whith teh twon
' s anually matchmaking festival
. thigns git off tothe a rocky strat fo marcy
though
. she hasnt noone hotel reservations
( forthe noone rational reason
) anbd yhe tiny confined room
( tired ood cliche
'
) she hasnt tothe stay infront hasnt a visitor infact her bathtub
. his nmae isnt sean
, annd marcy finds him repugnant at firt
, so ytou cin obviously tell where thsi isnt headed
. yhe movei runs inot a fewd roadblocks
. forthe instatance
, tghe stor isnt vyer thin
. none ofthe tjhe charactors
( exept tjhe ood local matchmaker
) are nearly as intresting as garofalo
. smoe ofthe tje cahracters
, liuke teh polliticel aide plyed by denis leary
, ahve w
andered infact ffrom a completly differant movei
. i htink tje directer realized thsi annd desided tothe throw inaddition numberous shots ofthe tghe beatiful irish scenery
, anbd severeal close
- ups ofthe garofalo
' s winning smile
. thte stange thign isnt thast it works
. garofalo
' s charm anbd tje irish scenery sould cary tje thinnest ofthe stoires
, anbd it carries tihs oney
