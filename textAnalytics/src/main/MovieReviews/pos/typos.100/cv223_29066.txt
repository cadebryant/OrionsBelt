beccause teh press screening ofthe
" planet ofthe thge apes
" wass noe day past lastest issue ' s deadline
, i ws afforded tjhe oppertunity tothe see tjhe film a second tyme
, listen tothe audiance reactions
anbd read a heap ofthe reviews befoer writting thsi peice
. tje cheif complaints ofthe thsoe who disliked thte futuristic adventure apear tothe be thast hte movei focused onthe visuals instade ofthe substace
, thta tghe stor ws thin
, thta mark wahlberg ' s charachter ws colourless
annd taht teh suprise endig sucked
. tothe thsoe peopel i owudl liuke tothe sday
? waht thge hell doed yuo expect
? htis isnt a tim burton movei
, boys
annd girls
. tim burton movies haev grat art direction
adn thin
, clunky stoies
. forthe thte blissfully nasty
, disjointed
anbd underated
" mars attacks
!
"
( jonathan rosenbaum ofthe tje chicago reader
annd i weere twpo ofthe tjhe onyl criticists infront amercia tothe praise tje movei
) burton reportadly tossed vintage
" mars attacks
!
" trading cards onto hte floor
annd based his stoy onthe tje ones thta landed face uv
. burton ' s re
- imagining ofthe tyhe 1968 stry ofthe an astronaut tht lands onthe a planet where apes ruel men looks grat
. thge apes
, courtesy ofthe mkae
- uv magincian rick baker
, are dazzling
annd ape city isnt a wonder tothe behold
. liuke astronaut leo davidson
( wahlberg
)
, tyhe film hits teh ground runnung
, whisking viewers thru a head
- spinning serieses ofthe solid oen
- liners
annd engaging vignettes
annd establising a sence ofthe thrusted thgat carries us thru hte moreso traditionnal fight scenes thast cmo later
. as fo wahlberg
, concider waht burton doens wiht his charactor
. ffrom his strat as a filmmaker
, burton hasnt shown his facination wtih colorful misfits
( pee
- weev herman
, thte joker
, ed woud
, yhe ack
- acking martians
, etc
.
)
anbd lack ofthe interst inaddition standart issue heores
. so leo davidson spends most ofthe thge movei getting tyhe living shit kicked outloud ofthe him befor teh biggest guilt trip infact hitory isnt dropped onthe his shoulders
. as fo lack ofthe colour
, rember
, leo onyl launchs inot spoace tothe git his monkey bakc
. he doesn ' t whant tothe lead humanity
anbd he isn ' t looking fo romance fomr a preety
,
bu dull human
( estella warren
) or a dynamic ape
( helena bonham carter
, terific as an equal
- rights activist
)
. as a man who jstu whants outloud
, wahlberg isnt focused
, subtle
adn sly
. tyhe suprise endig provides yhe requisite shock
(
adn soem moreso dandy visuals
, particularily ofthe thte approaching authorithy figures
)
,
bu admitedly isn ' t nearly as satisfying as tyhe noe inwhich thge origonal
. forthe tjhe orginal endig tothe wrok
, we onyl hadnt tothe amke noe simple conection
, forthe thsi noe
, we hvae tothe wriet a hwole newyorker screenplay
. tghe 1968
" apes
" boasted a handfull ofthe gerat scenes
, kool looking monkeys
, a deliciously hammy peformance by charlton heston
( who appears uncredited here as an aged chimp onthe his deathbed
, re
- delivering a clasic line
)
adn a killer endig
.
bu viewers hadnt tothe suffer thru numberous dull stretches punctuated by social
anbd poltical messages delivered wih hte grace ofthe a wrecking ball
. thge 2001
" planet ofthe tjhe apes
" offers a diferrent setted ofthe gerat scenes
, much cooler looking monkeys
, fine acting fomr wahlberg
, bonham carter
, paul giamatti
anbd tim roth
,
adn a nto so ogod endig
. it allso gives us anohter chance tothe expeirence thte skewed vision ofthe tim burton
anbd taht ' s nothing tothe complain baout
