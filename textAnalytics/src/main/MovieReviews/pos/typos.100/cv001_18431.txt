,
adn he seems tothe be haveing yhe most funn he ' s hadnt sicne
thn
. witherspoon isnt a revelation
. it ' s easly inaddition thge eyar
, it ' s a comedy
,
annd teenagers hvea littel clout
,
bu fo my moeny
, witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination
.
annd once campbell ' s charcter gets goign
, liuke inspite her fantastic speach inthe tghe gymnasium
,
thne ytou ' re won over
. oney thign taht ' s beeen bothering me sicne i ' ve seen it

,
bu doed tehy haev tothe throw inthe tyhe student
/ teacher relatiopnship
? even so
, ther ' s noone logical reason why mr
