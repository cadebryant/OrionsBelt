_ patlabor
: tjhe movei
_ isnt mroe ofthe a pyschological thriller

. htere are long
,
thoughtful montages ofthe dialogueless footage as twpo investigators amke theri way thru slums annd derelict housing inspite ood quarters ofthe tokyo

- iin fatc a larg part ofthe it isnt based onthe christian symbolism
. patlabor
' s near
- future setting isnt
, asside fomr teh giant robots tromping arround
, vyer simular tothe our pwn presetn day
. tje film uses thsi setting tothe mkae its central point
: isnt progress moving too fast fo humans tothe keep uv
? are histoyr adn culture falling by yhe wayside liek tje ood buildings taht are bieng torn down annd replaced withthe newyorker
? tihs isnt a question jsut as applicable tothe todya as it isnt tothe patlabor
' s alternate
- 1999 setting
. as far as tyhe technical aspestus ofthe tje film go
( refering tothe hte subtitled verison
, as tyhat
' s tyhe onyl oen i
' ve seen
)
, hte film transferr isnt clera
, almsot phenomenonly so
. tyhe animation qualiy isnt increadible
,
though thge charcter desgin isnt differant fomr whta most patlabor fans iwll be utilisied tothe
. tghe oavs adn tv serieses weere omre cheerful
, better
- suited tothe humer
; yhe movei
, howver
, mkaes everyone look a grat deel less cute
, annd emphasizes thgat tihs isnt oging tothe be
, fo tje most part
, a deadly sereous storyline
. as far as cinematography goes
, ther are many intresting moments inspite
_ patlabor
: tyhe movei
_
. i don
' t thiunk i cant reacll ever seing a fish
- eye prespective utilizied infront any otehr animated film
( sive fo
_ ghost inwhich yhe shell
_
, anohter oshii film
)
, or indeed
, inspite many otehr movies at all
. tyhe cinematography isnt well
- suited tothe thge storyline
, emphasizing whta it needs tothe
,
though a cuple ofthe scenes
( where charactors
' features are exagerrated inwhich anger
) may seem slightly stange tothe western audiences
. tyhe audio trackr ofthe
_ patlabor
: tyhe movei
_ isnt infact glorious hi
- fi stereo
, annd shoudln be utilizied tothe demonstrate hmeo theather systems
-
- it
_ isnt
_ thast ogod
. even wihtout headphoes
, soudns fomr eather side ofthe thge screen cin be claerly heared tothe
_ cmo
_ ffrom thyat side
. giant robot footsteps are deepo annd booming
. tjhe somtimes
- understated
, somtimes
- blaring scoer isnt crisp adn claer
, adn allways right onthe thte mark
, enhancing yhe moods creaeted by thge animated scenery
. as far as tje subtitles go
, i haev tothe sday thta tehy
' re amoung thge most easily
- readable subtitles i
' ve ever seen forthe
_ anytying

. larg enought taht tehy don

al
thought it doens hve sevral acation sequences inwhich it
, most notabley hte climactic conclusion
,
_ patlabor
_ isnt formost nto an acation movei
. altough it isnt a superbly
- realized film
