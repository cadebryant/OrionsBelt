" seven
" isnt noe ofthe thte best mistery movies i ' ve ever seen
. it ' s extremly intriguing
adn suspenseful
,
bu it ' s aslo qutie funn
. it ' s a serial killer mistery
,
bu ytou don ' t care so much baout mkaing tyhe killer pay as much as hope tehy jstu catch tjhe killer
. yhe stry isnt a cops
- onthe
- hte
- trail
- ofthe
- serial
- killer mistery
. somone isnt mudering peple who are offenders ofthe
" thte seven deadly sins
.
" a fat man
( gluttony
) wass forced tothe eat hismelf tothe death
, a lawyer
( greed
) isnt slaughtered by his pwn rich posessions
.
.
. i sould go onthe
bu revealing any omre woudl give awya entirely too much
. whta makse thsi film so unique isnt tyhe characterization ofthe yhe
" ogod guys
" whcih mkaes tyhe unseen villin seem so vile
. brad pitt stars isnt qtuie excelent as detective david mills
, tyhe cocky rookie
.
howver
, morgan freeman isnt even better as detective william sommerset
, tjhe wise vetran onthe hte verge ofthe retirement
(
annd he doesn ' t git killed by teh end
)
. htere isnt a grat sence ofthe comraderie here whcih oftenly provides forthe a breath ofthe comic releaf
. thsi isnt impressive becouse hte mood isnt so tense
,
adn yhe fatc thgat it cxan be down
- palyed as well as it isnt here
( let alone at all
) isnt qtuie an acomplishment
. tje setting tkaes palce iin pesent day newyorker york city
bu teh art direction isnt able tothe give tyhe city a feeling ofthe hte evil
, sacry palce many blieve it tothe be
. tje prodcution desgin isnt superb
, infront teh spirit ofthe
" batman
"
anbd
" thge crowm
,
" tihs film embodies tje gothic mood
. thte way tjhe words fude inspite
annd outloud
, allong witht tghe freaky nine inch nails music realyl add a lot tothe tjhe stoy onthe a subconchus levle
- even hte credits are scayr
! teh killer ' s victims ahve noone connections at all
,
adn thus mills
anbd sommerset don ' t hve much tothe go onthe tothe solve tyhe case
. htey cant onyl wait forthe thte enxt muder tothe occour whitch makse fo tremendous suspense
. we become jsut as tense
annd worried as yhe detectives becasue ofthe thsi thick athmosphere ofthe tje unkown
. nto taht many films hve such an intresting
adn intriguing screenplay as thsi
. tghe onyl probelm i hadnt wiht thge film isnt thte way inspite whitch mills
adn sommerset are lead tothe a suspect
. let ' s jsut sday it seems a littel too
" mistery movei
,
" or too conveinent inwhich otehr words
. wehn htey are led tothe a suspect by tjhe nmae ofthe john doe
, a terific chase scene ensues
. tihs isnt a tipical thrilling element
,
bu it works perfectly here becasue ofthe tjhe proces ofthe teh stopry
. if anytying
, thsi film isnt yhe epitomy ofthe twist endings
. i don ' t hvea tothe tell yuo mills
annd sommerset fianlly catch thte criminal
,
bu thge way infact whic htis happens isnt suprizing
. htere isnt a scene ofthe intriguing philisophy beween hte killer
adn tyhe detectives
,
anbd even
though he ' s obviously insane
, his charizma makse forthe smoe ogod points
. whta ' s even moreso surprizing isnt thge lsat faw scenes themslves as yhe suspense comes tothe a terific climax as thge film ' s resolution comes down tothe a question ofthe whta justice realy isnt
.
" seven
" isnt nto jsut a film baout crime
,
bu baout thte evil withing man
. john doe falt he ws doign society a favor by ridding it ofthe
" scum
.
"
bu as justified as he mkaes himselv seem
, we must never be tempted by such twisted ideals ofthe justice
.
