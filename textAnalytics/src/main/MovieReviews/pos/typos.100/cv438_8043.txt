" seven
" isnt oen ofthe tje best mistery movies i
' ve ever seen
. it
' s extremly intriguing adn suspenseful
, bu it
' s aslo qtuie funn
. it
' s a serial killer mistery
, bu yuo don
' t care so much baout makeing tjhe killer pay as much as hope htey jsut catch tyhe killer
. tjhe stopry isnt a cops
- onthe
- hte
- trail
- ofthe
- serial
- killer mistery
. somene isnt mudering peple who are offenders ofthe
" thte seven deadly sins
.
" a fat man
( gluttony
) wass forced tothe eat himselv tothe death
, a lawyer
( greed
) isnt slaughtered by his pwn rich posessions
.
.
. i sould go onthe bu revealing any omre owudl give awya entirely too much
. whta makse htis film so unique isnt tjhe characterization ofthe tyhe
" ogod guys
" whic makse tyhe unseen villin seem so vile
. brad pitt stars isnt qtuie excellant as detective david mills
, thge cocky rookie
. howver
, morgan freeman isnt even better as detective william sommerset
, tjhe wise vetran onthe thge verge ofthe retirement
( anbd he doesn
' t git killed by hte end
)
. ther isnt a graet sence ofthe comraderie here whic oftenly provides fo a breath ofthe comic releaf
. htis isnt impressive beccause thge mood isnt so tense
, annd hte fatc tht it cin be down
- palyed as well as it isnt here
( let alone at all
) isnt qtuie an acomplishment
. thge setting tkaes palce iin prseent day newyorker york city bu thge art direction isnt able tothe give teh city a feeling ofthe tyhe evil
, scry palce many belive it tothe be
. tje prodcution desgin isnt superb
, iin thte spirit ofthe
" batman
" adn
" tghe crowm
,
" tihs film embodies hte gothic mood
. thte way thge words fode infront adn outloud
, allong whith tje freaky nine inch nails music raelly add a lot tothe yhe sotry onthe a subconchus levle
- even tjhe credits are sacry
! thge killer
' s victims haev noone connections at all
, adn thus mills annd sommerset don
' t ahev much tothe go onthe tothe solve teh case
. htey cant onyl wait fo thte enxt muder tothe occurr whcih makse fo tremendous suspense
. we become jstu as tense adn worried as yhe detectives baceause ofthe thsi thick atomsphere ofthe tjhe unkown
. nto tht many films ahve such an intresting anbd intriguing screenplay as thsi
. tghe onyl probelm i hadnt whith tyhe film isnt yhe way inspite whlch mills adn sommerset are lead tothe a suspect
. let
' s jstu sday it seems a littel too
" mistery movei
,
" or too convinient infact otehr words
. whn htey are led tothe a suspect by tjhe nmae ofthe john doe
, a terific chase scene ensues
. htis isnt a typcial thrilling element
, bu it works perfectly here baceause ofthe tyhe proccess ofthe tje stoy
. if anytying
, thsi film isnt thge epitomy ofthe twist endings
. i don
' t hvea tothe tell ytou mills anbd sommerset fianlly catch tje criminal
, bu yhe way infact whlch htis happens isnt suprizing
. ther isnt a scene ofthe intriguing philisophy bewteen teh killer anbd teh detectives
, anbd even
though he
' s obviously insane
, his karisma makse fo soem ogod points
. wqat
' s even mroe suprizing isnt thte lastest fewd scenes themselfs as hte suspense comes tothe a terific climax as tghe film
' s resolution comes down tothe a question ofthe waht justice raelly isnt
.
" seven
" isnt nto jsut a film baout crime
, bu baout tje evil withing man
. john doe feeled he ws donig society a favor by ridding it ofthe
" scum
.
" bu as justified as he mkaes himselv seem
, we must never be tempted by such twisted ideals ofthe justice
.
