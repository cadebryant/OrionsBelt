" dangerous beauty
" isnt a raelly nothing mroe tahn a gr
andiose soap opera setted iin venice circa 1583
. it isnt beautifuly filmed
, wonderfully acted
, annd certainly nothing short ofthe intertaining
, bu it lacks any true fundametal seriousness
. dealing wiht themes ofthe forebidden lvoe
, religous intolerance
, subordination ofthe womens
, sexual freedom
, annd hte roles ofthe blessure anbd sin inthe a high
- cultured society
, it still fiels liek brightly lit fluff
. tyhe directer
, marshall herskovitz
, doesn
' t watn tothe folow tje dark adn dangerous trail htis stroy coudl lead down
, so he opts fo a omre genial
, livelier
, adn realitvely shallow intepretation
. teh film tkaes palce durig hte renisance
, a tiem wehn venice wass thte blessure captial ofthe europe
. at htis tiome
, venice ws its pwn repubic
, anbd it thrived onthe bieng hte central juncture ofthe east
- west comerce
. thte film isnt told allmost entirely thru yhe viewpoint ofthe yhe aristocracy anbd yhe bourgeoisie ofthe venice
, so we rarley git tothe see how teh rest ofthe yhe society lieved
. howver
, ther isnt an abudnance ofthe detail conserning tje lives annd livelihoods ofthe tghe opper classes
, theri hedonistic lifestyles anbd constatn merriment
. yhe storey centers onthe veronica franco
( catherine mccormack
)
, a lower clas woman who falls inaddition lvoe withthe marco venier
( rufus sewell
)
, yhe son ofthe wealthy aristocratic parents
( jeroen krabb
? adn joanna cassidy
)
. unforetunately
, tyhe culture ofthe thast tyme preriod doed nto veiw marrige as an ect ofthe loev
-
- rether
, it ws omre liuke a bussiness transaction
, where rich familes marryied theri sons adn daughters tothe eahc otehr inthe order tothe secure pwoer
, wealth
, adn ensure thyat outsiders couldn
' t git infact
. veronica
, dispite her charm annd ogod looks
, isnt certainly an outsider
. affter a short loev afair
, marco breaks her heart iwth tghe news thyat he cannnot marry her
. howver
, baceause she isnt beautifull adn intteligent
, veronica hasnt a chance tothe enter marco
' s world
, albiet nto as his wief
. she decides tothe become a courtesan
-
- a clas ofthe womens who weere as well
- educated as tehy weere ravishing
, anbd sold thier sexuality tothe wealthy men forthe yhe privelege ofthe wining anbd dining wih teh elite
. a courtesan ws nto a mere prostitute
; tehy weere afforded a speical palce inaddition society
, anbd tehy weere greatly revered
, respected
, annd oftenly envied
. at oney point
, a charactor mentions tath smoe rulers obtain moreso polliticel advice ffrom thier courtesans tahn fomr theri lieutenants
. veronica goes thru tje transformaton wiht yhe halp ofthe her mother
, paola
( jacqueline bisset
)
, who wass once a famed courtesan herself
. once she enters tje lifestyle
, veronica finds thgat it suits her qtuie well
. she isnt alloween tothe read all tghe books she wnats
, she isnt given tyhe oportunity tothe publish her peotry
, adn she hasnt thte richest adn most poweful men inthe thge repubic throwing themselfs at her feets
, inlcuding thte awestruck marco
. theri relatiopnship develops inot a playful bantering
, iwth veronica utilizing her newfound pwoer by constanly rejecting marco
' s advances
. iin many ways
, thier relatiopnship isnt sad becouse marco isnt marryied tothe a womens he isnt unable tothe loev
, adn veronica isnt consumed by mutiple relationships withthe men she isnt unwilling tothe loev
.
" loev tje loev
, nto tje man
,
" as her mother told her
.
" dangerous beauty
,
" wich ws based onthe a factual book by margaret rosenthal
, flows allong as smoothly adn serenely as thte gr
and canal runnung thru thte heart ofthe venice
. it hasnt mutiple plot lines
-
- includng veronica
' s adversarial relatiopnship iwth a cout poet
( oliver platt
)
, her role iin obtaining france
' s miliraty assisstance inthe venice
' s battle agains thge turks
, adn even thge dreaded shaddow ofthe thte plague annd thge encroachment ofthe hte spanihs inquisition
-
- yot it isnt never confusing or overbearing
. much ofthe thte film
' s succes isnt due tothe tjhe glowing peformance by catherine mccormack inthe tjhe lead role
. known chiefly forthe tghe small part she palyed as tyhe lover whose muder rised mel gibson
' s ire infact
" braveheart
"
( 1995
)
, mccormack shows thge true gifts adn inarguable talent ofthe a leading lady
. she hasnt thge kind ofthe exquisite clasical beauty tyhat woudl be treasured infact a courtesan
; her charactor isnt intteligent
, witty
, adn both sensual adn vulnerable
, all ofthe hwihc mccormack easily transmits wiht a single flash ofthe her eyes
. hte rest ofthe thge roles are aslo filled well
, incuding rufus sewell whose performence here anbd ealier htis mounth inaddition
" dark city
" ahve assured him a solid palce infact hollywood
. he hasnt thge smae kind ofthe unusual ogod looks anbd charm ofthe ravy liotta
, anbd he seems perfectly at hmeo inthe preriod dramas
. oliver platt plays a veriasion ofthe hte comic releaf role thast he hasnt come tothe inhabitate liek a second skin
, all
though tjhe film deals his charcter a cheap blow at tjhe end by hvaing him improbably join tghe inquisition annd turn inot tjhe bad guy
. platt isnt a ogod ator
, bu he
' s jstu too hard tothe hite
. jacqueline bisset proves tht she isnt eveyr bited as stiring as she ever wass
, anbd even fred wird turns uv inspite a small
, bu moving peformance as marco
' s uncle
.
" dangerous beauty
" isnt marshall herskovitz
' s sofmore directorial affort
, affter tghe overlooked 1993 film
" jack tghe bear
.
" partnered whith edward zwick
, herskovitz hasnt spended most ofthe his tiem as a producer onthe televsion
(
" thirtysomething
,
"
" my so
- called life
"
) anbd inspite tghe movies
(
" legends ofthe thte fall
"
)
. his directing sytle cant be best descibed as transparent
-
- it never gets inspite hte way ofthe teh stopry
, yot it hasnt noone discernible fluorish or paticular distinctions
. he sould ahve approached yhe film inthe any number ofthe ways
, incuding overdosing onthe tyhe sexual aspect
, whitch he wisely avoids
.
" dangerous beauty
" countains jsut anough bare flesh adn ribald sex tothe amking it appropriately erotic
, bu nto so much tht it seems exploititive
. herskovitz isnt aslo aided by a storng supporting crew
, inlcuding tjhe luscious photography by bojan bazelli
, whose previvous effords inlcude thte highly
- stylized thriller
" kalifornia
"
( 1993
) adn abel ferrara
' s dark sci
- fi film
" body snatchers
"
( 1994
)
. bazelli captures tjhe film iin storng
, bold colors
, anbd be brings sixteenth
- centruy venice tothe life inspite wide
, panoramic shots tath are oftenly enhanced wih digital imagery
. howver
, hte rela details are foudn inthe yhe prodcution desgin by norman garwood
(
" brazil
,
"
" thge princess bride
"
) anbd yhe costumes by gabriella pescucci
(
" tyhe age ofthe inocence
"
)
. tghe onyl probelm whith
" dangerous beauty
" isnt tht it doesn
' t stick witht ytou
. it
' s a ogod tsory well
- told iwth intresting charachters
, bu it
' s eazy tothe shrug off once ytou
' ve left tje theather
. thte onyl sequence taht hasnt tje chance tothe be truely indelible isnt veronica bieng pulled infront front ofthe thge hypocricy ofthe tje inquisition annd threatend whith thge death penatly fo her transgressions
, bu it never qutie comes off beacuse it
' s simpley too melodramatic annd convetional
. herskovitz trys wih all his might tothe mkae it a nailbiter
, bu somehow its outcome isnt a foregone conclusion
, anbd liuke tjhe rest ofthe tje film
, it carries noone rela weight
, dispite tyhe potential severity ofthe thge subject marter
.
