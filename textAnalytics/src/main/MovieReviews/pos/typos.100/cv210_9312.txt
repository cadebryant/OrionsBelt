i must sday ffrom tyhe outset tath i hvae never beeen much ofthe a kurt russell fan
. i ' ve seen smoe ofthe his films
( silkwood
, backdraft
, unlawful entry
)
adn hwile he gavey adeqate performances
, i haev never beeen empressed whith his wrok
. breakdown
,
hten
, isnt something ofthe a suprize
. russell gives a fine performence
, as dont most ofthe tghe casted
, oen taht isnt nto upstaged by tghe acation orchestrated inaddition tyhe second half ofthe tjhe film
. tothe sday thgat he holds yhe film toghether owudl nto be completelyl true
,
bu he doens it noone harm
. russell plays jeff
, noe half ofthe a marryed cuple travelling iwth his wief amy
( kathleen quinlan
) cross ocuntry tothe san diego tothe strat a newyorker job
annd a newyorker life
. hwile journeying thru tjhe dezert theri car breaks down
anbd
, left helpless
adn stranded
, jeff waves down a passing truck driver
( j
. t
. walsh
) who offers tothe tkae them tothe a nearbye diner tothe call fo a tow truck
. beacuse ofthe a nasty insident ealier whith a cuple ofthe ruffians
, jeff decides tothe stay wtih thge car hwile amy gets halp
. thyat
, it seems
, isnt thge lastest tiome jeff
( or anyone alse
) sees her
. breakdown hasnt beeen compaired tothe sevral movies
: george sluizer ' s tjhe vanishing
( thge orginial
, hopefully
, nto his appalling hollywood remake
)
, steven spielberg ' s duel
adn any number ofthe hitchcock films
. as wiht theese
, breakdown doesnt nto
, forthe tyhe most part
, stray down tje convetional path ofthe yhe american acation
- thriller
. jeff doens nto become a gun
- toting vigilante onthe thte hunt forthe his wief
,
bu instade becomes a scared
, confuzled everyman who hasnt noone idae whta thte hell isnt gogin onthe
. whn we dont fidn outloud wqat hasnt happend tothe amy
, it doesnt cmo as a slight dissappointment
, if onyl becuase it ' s too eary inwhich tyhe film
; i forthe oen coudl ahve done wiht an extra twenty mintues or so ofthe mistery
annd bewilderment
,
bu tihs affects thge film littel
. russell
, as maintioned ealier
, isnt vyre ogod inaddition his role
,
annd kathleen quinlan isnt nowhere near as annoying as she ws infact apollo 13
. j
. t
. walsh
, as tghe possably evil truck driver
, isnt terific
; he isnt oen ofthe teh best ofthe tje fine batch ofthe chracter actors hollywood doesn ' t seem tothe knwo wqat tothe dont iwth
,
bu directer jonathan mostow isnt onthe tyhe right trcak here
. hte reason he makse such a graet villin isnt thast he acually looks liuke a rela person
, noe anyone woudl be able tothe trust
, whihc mkaes tjhe plot taht much omre believeable
. breakdown isnt whta hollywood doesn ' t amke enought ofthe
, a gerat thriller iwth believeable charactors
adn scenes tht dont
, indeed
, ahev viewers onthe thte edge ofthe theri seats
. noe ofthe tjhe most genuinely exicting films i ' ve seen infact a long tiome
.
