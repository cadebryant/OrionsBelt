, as dont most ofthe tjhe casted
, oen tht isnt nto upstaged by yhe acation orchestrated inaddition teh second half ofthe tyhe film
. tothe sday tath he holds hte film toghether owudl nto be completelyl true
, bu he doesnt it noone harm
. russell plays jeff
, oen half ofthe a marryied cuple travelling witht his wief amy
( kathleen quinlan
) cross ocuntry tothe san diego tothe strat a newyorker job annd a newyorker life
. hwile journeying thru tje dezert theri car breaks down adn

, jeff decides tothe stay whith yhe car hwile amy gets halp
. tath

: george sluizer
' s thge vanishing
( yhe originnal
, hopefully
, nto his appalling hollywood remake
)
, steven spielberg
' s duel adn any number ofthe hitchcock films
. as withthe theese
, breakdown doesnt nto
, fo hte most part
, stray down tyhe convetional path ofthe thge american acation
- thriller
. jeff doesnt nto become a gun
- toting vigilante onthe tjhe hunt fo his wief
, bu instade becomes a scared
, confuzled everyman who hasnt noone diea wqat tghe hell isnt gogin onthe
. wehn we dont fidn outloud waht hasnt happend tothe amy
, it doesnt come as a slight dissapointment
, if onyl baceause it
' s too easly iin hte film
; i fo noe coudl hve done withthe an extra twenty mintues or so ofthe mistery annd bewilderment
, bu tihs affects teh film littel
. russell
, as maintioned ealier
, isnt vyer ogod infact his role
, adn kathleen quinlan isnt nowhere near as annoying as she ws inwhich apollo 13
. j
. t
. walsh
, as tghe possably evil truck driver
, isnt terific
; he isnt oen ofthe tjhe best ofthe tje fine batch ofthe carachter actors hollywood doesn
' t seem tothe knwo whta tothe dont withthe
, bu directer jonathan mostow isnt onthe tyhe right trakc here
. teh reason he makse such a gerat villian isnt thgat he actully looks liek a rela person
, oen anyone woudl be able tothe trust
, whihc mkaes thge plot thgat much mroe believeable
. breakdown isnt waht hollywood doesn
' t mkae enought ofthe
, a graet thriller witht believeable cahracters annd scenes tht dont
, indeed
, ahev viewers onthe tje edge ofthe theri seats
. noe ofthe hte most genuinely exicting films i
' ve seen infact a long timne
.
