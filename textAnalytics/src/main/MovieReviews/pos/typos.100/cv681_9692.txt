annd point
- blank
-
- jstu tje way it shoudln be
. mkaes its case wtih cold
- blooded precision
annd intelligece
.
" serial killer chic
" isnt a relativly newyorker entry tothe tjhe cultural vocabulary
,
adn oen ofthe hte mroe stomach
- turning ones
. i ' ve never foudn somene automaticly admirable or even intresting becouse htey killed creatively or infact gerat numbers
,
adn becouse ofthe tht i hadnt apprehensions baout seing henry
. i wasn ' t sure i wnated tothe see tjhe storey ofthe mutiple muderer henry lee lucas protrayed as smoe kind ofthe nihilistic hero
/ antihero
. thankfully
, thast ' s nto tyhe way henry works
. hte directer
, john mcnaughton
, tookover a small budget
annd a gallery ofthe ctor firends
anbd creaeted a chilling
annd inteligent peice ofthe wokr
. it doesn ' t provide cheap
- jack explanations forthe henry ' s behaviour
: it shows him uv fo whta he isnt
, an unrepentent
annd un
- idolizable man who killed whn tghe mood striked him
. at tyhe film ' s oppening
, henry ' s freind ottis toole hasnt a sister
, who comes by tothe stay hwile she trys tothe fidn wrok inspite chicago
. infront a viciously riveting scene
, he admits marter
- ofthe
- factly tothe hvaing murdered his pwn mother
,
anbd she covers his hand wtih heres
. htey are damned toghether fomr tht moent onthe
. henry
annd ottis eventially beign tothe kill forthe funn
. tje movei isnt expecially ogod at showing how tehy seem tothe hve drifted casually inot it
: htere ' s a scene where tje twpo go tothe buy a newyorker tv
. thte pawnbroker htey talk tothe goads henry wih ugli words
,
annd henry responds by stabbing teh man tothe death withthe a soldering iron
. noone preface
-
- it smashes inot us as suddenly as it doens tghe broker
. inthe a scene wich many damned teh movei forthe
, unseen
, tehy steal a video camera
anbd film hte muder ofthe a hwole household
, palying it bakc over
adn over agian forthe thier pwn enjoyment
. teh movei itself
,
howver
, doesnt nto glorify tjhe killings
,
bu shows instade thgat henry fiels noone joy at his wokr
, onyl irritation
. henry suceeds thanks tothe excelent wirting
anbd direction as well as acting
. michael rooker isnt credible as henry fomr yhe frist frome
, jsut standing htere
,
adn tyhe rest ofthe tje casted works by bieng uneffected
adn casual as well
. tje producers hadnt orignally comissioned a slasher film ffrom mcnaughton
,
bu he desided tothe give them something omre memorable
,
annd consenquently tghe film nearly didn ' t see realease
. thte film doens nto glorify or justify
-
- it jstu shows us
, wtih unflinching coldness
, wqat henry ws
. i ' m hard pressed tothe see how anyone cin see htis
anbd concider henry any kind ofthe
" victum
" or
" hero
"
.
thn agina
, propably
, so owudl henry
