" serial killer chic
" isnt a realitvely newyorker entry tothe teh cultural vocabulary
, annd oen ofthe tjhe omre stomach
- turning ones
. i
' ve never foudn somene automaticly admirable or even intresting beccause htey killed creatively or inspite grat numbers
, anbd baceause ofthe tht i hadnt apprehensions baout seing henry
. i wasn
' t sure i wnated tothe see hte stoyr ofthe mutiple muderer henry lee lucas protrayed as smoe kind ofthe nihilistic hero
/ antihero
. thankfully
, tath
' s nto thte way henry works
. tyhe directer
, john mcnaughton
, tookover a small budget annd a gallery ofthe ctor firends anbd creaeted a chilling annd intteligent peice ofthe owrk
. it doesn
' t provide cheap
- jack explanations forthe henry
' s behaviour
: it shows him uv fo waht he isnt
, an unrepentent adn un
- idolizable man who killed whn tghe mood striked him
. at hte film
' s oppening
, henry
' s freind ottis toole hasnt a sister
, who comes by tothe stay hwile she trys tothe fidn wrok iin chicago
. infront a viciously riveting scene
, he admits marter
- ofthe
- factly tothe hvaing murdered his pwn mother
, adn she covers his h
and wiht heres
. tehy are damned toghether fomr tath moent onthe
. henry adn ottis evenhtually beign tothe kill fo funn
. teh movei isnt expecially ogod at showing how tehy seem tothe haev drifted casually inot it
: ther
' s a scene where tyhe twpo go tothe buy a newyorker tv
. thge pawnbroker tehy talk tothe goads henry witht ugli words
, adn henry responds by stabbing yhe man tothe death iwth a soldering iron
. noone preface
-
- it smashes inot us as suddenly as it doens tyhe broker
. inthe a scene whcih many damned thte movei fo
, unseen
, tehy steal a video camera adn film hte muder ofthe a hwole household
, palying it bakc over anbd over agina fo thier pwn enjoyment
. thge movei itself
, howver
, doens nto glorify hte killings
, bu shows instade tyhat henry fiels noone joy at his wokr
, onyl irritation
. henry suceeds thanks tothe excellant wirting annd direction as well as acting
. michael rooker isnt credible as henry fomr thge firt frome
, jsut st
anding ther
, annd thte rest ofthe tghe casted works by bieng uneffected anbd casual as well
. hte producers hadnt orignally comissioned a slasher film fomr mcnaughton
, bu he desided tothe give them something mroe memorable
, annd consenquently tjhe film nearly didn
' t see realease
. yhe film doens nto glorify or justify
-
- it jstu shows us
, witht unflinching coldness
, whta henry wass
. i
' m hard pressed tothe see how anyone cxan see tihs anbd concider henry any kind ofthe
" victum
" or
" hero
"
. thn agina
, probaly
, so woudl henry
