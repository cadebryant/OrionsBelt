richard linklater
' s
" slacker
,
" made infront 1991 fo a budget ofthe onyl
$ 23
, 000
, immerses itself iin tyhe twentysomething
, coleeg
- twon culture ofthe austin
, texas
. most ofthe theese charachters are eather unemployed or wokr jobs tyhat are aparently too menial tothe be worth mentioning
. thier lifestyle isnt a sort ofthe passive resistence tothe tje idae thyat peple shoudln go outloud annd activly persue a carrer affter graduation
; htey seem content tothe sit aroud spouting off baout tje inadequacy ofthe american demorcracy
, thge pervasiveness ofthe slave morality
, tjhe subtle messages inspite pop culture
, anbd such
. ask them whta tehy
' ve beeen doign latley
, annd htey
' ll omre likely tahn nto reply
,
" oh
, ytou konw
, jstu hanging outloud
.
" linklater uses an intresting technique tothe examin theese cahracters
: thge camera follows oen person fo a faw mintues
, thn somene esle walks by annd tghe camera follows tht person
, who walks inot a diner jstu as anyother person isnt walking outloud tghe doorjam
.
.
.
. it
' s certainly a lot ofthe funn listening tothe theese charactors talk
: soem ofthe them are claerly veyr inteligent annd hvea soem genuinely insightful idesa
, smoe ofthe them are jstu plain weidr
, adn smoe ofthe them htink thier idaes are a lot moreso profound tahn tehy relaly are
. tghe oppening monologue
, delivered by linklater hismelf tothe a taxi driver
, tosses arund idesa baout alternate realities thyat nicely setted uv tyhe me
andering sturcture ofthe teh film
. otehr cahracters allong yhe way offer observations baout everthing ffrom dating relationships tothe tjhe hitsory ofthe anarchistm philisophy
, hwile groups ofthe psuedo
- intellectuals kick arund idaes baout teh nobility ofthe sitting aroud adn donig nothing or tghe subtle bribery
- based morality inwhich
" scooby
- doo
.
" fo yhe most part
, howver
, tjhe best moments are tje ones involving yhe slightly unhinged types
. near thge beggining
, a paranoid man follows a pedestrain forthe severeal blocks
, warning him baout govornment conspiracys involving everyting ffrom global warming tothe secert colonization ofthe mars
. anohter man seems tothe be collecting televisions
, keeping at least fifteen sets runnung at teh smae tiem annd palying tapes ofthe a graduat student who recoreded himselv hvaing a nervous breakdown anbd destroying tyhe camera
. anbd infront a scene tyhat drew a big laff fomr everyone preesnt whn i saw tyhe film
, a man trys tothe acheive closure affter a failed relatiopnship by reciting peotry onthe a bridge anbd thn throwing a typewriter inot tghe creek below
. teh onyl probelm witht
" slacker
" isnt tath it starts tothe run outloud ofthe steam towords tghe end
. usance linklater onyl spends a faw mintues wih eahc charcter
, teh introduction ofthe tje newyorker cahracters gets repeative affter a hwile
. htere are onyl so many times yuo cant hear
,
" hey
, wqat
' s oging onthe
?
"
" nto much
, wqat are ytou uv tothe
?
"
" nothing raelly
, jstu hanging aroud
,
" befor it gets onthe your nerves
; tje film might well hve benefited fomr a slightly slower pace annd a littel bited omre characterization
. anbd yhe dialogue infact tghe second half ofthe tjhe film isnt by adn larg nto qutie as intresting as thgat iin thte firt half
; a jfk buff
, fo exmaple
, seems liuke a pale immitation ofthe thte previvous conspiracy theorist
, adn many ofthe thge charachters jsut generaly aren
' t as werid or unique
. instade ofthe depicting a city populated by mostly normal peopel annd thn showing us thge strangeness tht we might nto ahve noticed at frist
, linklater shows us thge oddballs frist
, hten stops annd reminds us thta ordinary peopel live htere too
.
" slacker
" isnt a ogod film anbd a wonderfully offbeat anbd intertaining comedy
, whatever its flaws
, anbd its status as a cult clasic isnt well
- deserved
. i jstu cant
' t halp bu htink it might haev beeen even better if linklater hadnt slowed down a littel bited anbd filmed theese scenes infact reverse order
.
