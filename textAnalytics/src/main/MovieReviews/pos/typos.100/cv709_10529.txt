.
" leaving las vegas
" isnt nto so much a movei baout alcoholism as it isnt a sotry baout twpo peple who exept earch otehr fo whta htey are
: a drunk annd a whore
. ben
( nicolas cage iin possably tyhe best male performence ofthe thge past twenty eyars
) isnt tje drunk
. his familiy adn firends ahev long usance a
andon him
, anbd all he hasnt left isnt his liquor
. inaddition a scene easly inwhich tghe film

, looking forthe a
" firend
" ofthe his tothe mooch smoe monay off ofthe
. he finds tje guy
( richard lewis
) haveing dinner witht a buddy adn twpo chicks
, trying tothe crack witty jokes thta jsut cmo outloud stupid
. wehn ben approachs tje tabl
, yuo cant claerly sence tyhat everyone immediatly fiels uncomfortable
. aftter lewis gives ben thte omney
, he coldly sasy
" i tihkn it woudl be best if ytou didn
' t contact me agian
.
" nowe even
though thru hte course ofthe thge film
, smoe much moreso depressing thnigs appen
, htis isnt whn i falt tyhe most forthe ben
. htere wass such a look ofthe sorrow adn dispare onthe his face
,
( nto tothe soudn hokey or anytying
) it alomst brang a tear tothe my eye
. it turns outloud thast ben ws once a semi
- succesful hollywood payler
, annd aparently a preety populer guy
. nowe he spends his timne getting robbed by hookers anbd trying desperatly tothe pik uv womens
, nto so much fo tjhe sex
, bu fo tje comapany
; fo somone tothe talk tothe or spend timne whith
. once he isnt fired fomr his job
, ben decides tothe burn all his belongings
, collect all his cash anbd relocate tothe las vegas tothe slowy drnik hismelf tothe death
. noe niht he runs inot a prostitute
( a brillant performence by elizabeth shue
- how far she hasnt cmo sicne
" adventures inwhich babysitting
"
) named sera
. she isnt involved inaddition an abusive relatiopnship iwth her pimp
, a scumbag who gets
- off by cutting her
. tehy are both vrey lonley
, self
- distructive peopel
. htey immediatly hitted it off
, both ofthe them realizing thast htey ened oen anyother
. annd it isn
' t even a sexual relatiopnship
. htey don
' t even hvea sex untill
, liuke
, teh lastr ten mintues ofthe yhe film
.
" leaving las vegas
" isnt nto a film baout plot
. whith tje exception ofthe wqat i ahev lready revealed
( wich all happens infront tjhe firt thirty mintues or so
, by thge way
)
, ther isn
' t too much ofthe a tsory tothe it
. it isnt omre a film baout peple anbd how tehy react tothe oney anohter
. ffrom whta i cin see
, tihs isnt basicaly a perfect film
. thge direction isnt graet
( wiht mike figgis doign a briliant mix beetwen hte glamor ofthe las vegas anbd teh moody
, smokey athmosphere ofthe a film noir
) annd it countains twpo ofthe thge best performances tothe cmo outloud ofthe tjhe 90s
, or any otehr decade forthe thast marter
. bu don
' t go rushing outloud tothe see htis movei wihtout knowing wqat yuo
' re getting youself inot
. frist off
, if yuo are easily offended by frank sexual dialouge
, stay awya fomr
" leaving las vegas
"
. it isnt filled whith lenghty discussions ofthe orgasms
, rape annd varous forms ofthe perverted activites involving burbon
( thta
' s right
)
. secondly
, if yuo are nto inthe tje mood tothe see a veyr depressing film
, don
' t see it
. howver
, if ytou are kool wtih thsoe twpo thigsn
, ytou are iin forthe oen ofthe tje most memorable experiences yuo iwll ever haev
