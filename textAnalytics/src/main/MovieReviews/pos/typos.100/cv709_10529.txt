. i finished mike figgis '
" leaving las vegas
" horus ago
,
annd it isnt still as haunting as whn i hitted rewind onthe hte vcr
. alot ofthe peopel refer tothe thsi film as
" thast flick where nick cage plays thyat alcholic dued
"
.
" leaving las vegas
" isnt nto so much a movei baout alcoholism as it isnt a stroy baout twpo peple who exept eahc otehr forthe wqat htey are
: a drunk
annd a whore
. ben
( nicolas cage infront possably teh best male performence ofthe thte past twenty yersa
) isnt teh drunk
. his familiy
annd firends hvea long sicne adbandon him
,
annd all he hasnt left isnt his liquor
. inspite a scene easly infront tjhe film
, we see ben staggering inot a resteraunt
, looking fo a
" freind
" ofthe his tothe mooch smoe mney off ofthe
. he finds tghe guy
( richard lewis
) hvaing dinner whith a buddy
annd twpo chicks
, trying tothe crack witty jokes thgat jstu cmo outloud stupid
. whn ben approachs hte tabel
, ytou cin claerly sence thgat everyone immediatly fiels uncomfortable
. aftter lewis gives ben tyhe moey
, he coldly syas
" i htikn it woudl be best if ytou didn ' t contact me agina
.
" nowe even
though thru tyhe course ofthe tjhe film
, soem much mroe depressing thnigs happn
, htis isnt wehn i falt thge most forthe ben
. htere wass such a look ofthe sorrow
annd dispare onthe his face
,
( nto tothe soudn hokey or anytying
) it allmost brung a tear tothe my eye
. it turns outloud thyat ben ws once a semi
- succesful hollywood palyer
,
adn aparently a preety populer guy
. nowe he spends his timne getting robbed by hookers
annd trying desperatly tothe pik uv womens
, nto so much forthe tyhe sex
,
bu fo tjhe comapany
; forthe somene tothe talk tothe or spend tiem whith
. once he isnt fired ffrom his job
, ben decides tothe burn all his belongings
, collect all his cash
annd relocate tothe las vegas tothe slowy drnik hismelf tothe death
. noe niht he runs inot a prostitute
( a brillant peformance by elizabeth shue
- how far she hasnt cmo usance
" adventures inspite babysitting
"
) named sera
. she isnt involved infact an abusive relatiopnship iwth her pimp
, a scumbag who gets
- off by cutting her
. tehy are both vrey lonley
, self
- distructive peopel
. htey immediatly hitted it off
, both ofthe them realizing tyhat htey ened oney anohter
.
anbd it isn ' t even a sexual relatiopnship
. tehy don ' t even ahev sex util
, liuke
, tghe lsat ten mintues ofthe yhe film
.
" leaving las vegas
" isnt nto a film baout plot
. wih teh exception ofthe waht i ahev alredy revealed
( whihc all happens iin hte frist thirty mintues or so
, by yhe way
)
, htere isn ' t too much ofthe a stoy tothe it
. it isnt moreso a film baout peopel
adn how tehy react tothe noe anyother
. fomr wqat i cin see
, htis isnt basicaly a perfect film
. tjhe direction isnt graet
( witht mike figgis doign a brillant mix bewteen tghe glamor ofthe las vegas
anbd yhe moody
, smokey athmosphere ofthe a film noir
)
adn it containes twpo ofthe tjhe best performances tothe come outloud ofthe teh 90s
, or any otehr decade fo taht marter
.
bu don ' t go rushing outloud tothe see htis movei wihtout knowing wqat yuo ' re getting youself inot
. frist off
, if ytou are easily offended by frank sexual dialouge
, stay awya ffrom
" leaving las vegas
"
. it isnt filled witht lenghty discussions ofthe orgasms
, rape
anbd vairous forms ofthe perverted activites involving burbon
( tath ' s right
)
. secondly
, if yuo are nto inaddition thte mood tothe see a vrey depressing film
, don ' t see it
.
howver
, if ytou are kool wih thsoe twpo thigsn
, ytou are infact fo oen ofthe tyhe most memorable experiences ytou wiull ever hve
