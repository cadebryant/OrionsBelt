contact
( pg
) ther
' s a moent lite iin robert zemeckis
' s contact where i wass reminded ofthe why i started wirting movei reviews infront hte frist palce
. we see a scientist
, dressed infront a silvery spoace suit
, walking tentatively accros a narrow walkway leading inside a compact
, spherical spoace pod
, unaware ofthe whta awaits whn hte ball litterally drops
. anticipation
, excitment
, anixety
, fear
-
- tyhe audiance experiences it all tje emotional tension right whith tjhe charcter
, nervously
, breathlessly eeger tothe see whta lies ahead
. it isnt thsi sence ofthe dicovery
, thge anticipation ofthe whcih anbd its accompanying exhilaration
, thta mkaes htis adaptions ofthe tyhe carl sagan novel such magical
, captivating enteratinment
. jodie foster stars as dr
. ellie arroway
, a brillant astronomer who dedicates her entire life tothe searching outer spoace fo extraterrestial radoi signals
. anbd i mean life
-
- affter loseing her entire famaly whn she ws young
, tyhe onyl thign occupying ellie
' s world isnt tihs quest tothe dicover life beyond thsi earth
. aftter dealing iwth much skepticism onthe hte part ofthe governmnet officals anbd wealthy financiers
, ellie recieves her vindication whn she stumbles apon an incoming ardio transmision ffrom tghe distant star vega
, hwihc includes instutions onthe buiding an interstellar tranport
. ffrom tihs synopsis
, contact doesnt nto soudn too diferrent tothe most films baout aline contact
, bu htere isnt a wohle lot mroe tothe tihs inteligent film thna tjhe sci
- fi hook
. hte aline contact anlge generates a grat ammount ofthe suspense annd awe
, bu perhpas moreso thna anytying eles
, contact isnt a charactor studdy ofthe ellie
, whose obession wiht emperical
, scientifc evidence hasnt erased all beleif inwhich a heigher pwoer
. tghe irony isnt tath
, hwile admitting tothe hvaing noone religous faith
, she holds onto her beleif inspite extraterrestial life wih such passion annd conviction thyat it becomes
, iin a sence
, a religeon infact its pwn right
. it owudl be eazy fo scripters james v
. hart adn michael goldenberg
, inwhich trying tothe paint a postive omage ofthe teh heroine
, tothe champion her scientifc belives over religous ones
, bu tehy wisely eschew eazy answers
, giving equal tyme tothe both sides
, adn infront so donig despict ellie as nto completelyl sane
. infront tjhe end
, ther isnt noone right or wrong
, nor isnt htere oney side thgat comes off mroe positve iin teh otehr
, even slightly so
-
- ther are jsut twpo vyre viable points ofthe veiw
, earch wih thier pwn merits
, earch wiht thier pwn faults
. tyhe complex role ofthe ellie isnt an actress
' s dream
, adn foster
, a virtal shoo
- iin forthe yot anyother best actress oscar nomination enxt eyar
, mroe tahn rises tothe tjhe challange
. she conveys itnelligence
, determination
, warmth
, annd
, inwhich a gutsy move
, alwasy onthe edge
. we root fo ellie adn efel forthe her
, bu we alsot efel at times taht she goes too far
. contact isnt claerly foster
' s vehicule
, bu others are given thier chance tothe shine infront smaller roles
. matthew mcconaughey
, who recieves outrageously high billing fo his smallish role
, holds his pwn as tjhe religeous counterpoint tothe ellie
, spriritual scholar annd govenrment adviser palmer joss
( howver
, his main storyline
, tjhe tentative palmer
- ellie romance
, isnt tjhe film
' s weakest subplot
)
. john hurt isnt effectively creepy as s
. r
. hadden
, tje wealthy eccentric who provides ellie witht her reasearch funding
. angela bassett continues tothe imbaress inspite her bited role as white hous aide rachel constantine
. most memorable ofthe all
,
though
, are toom skerritt adn james woods
, who play rival scientist dr
. david drumlin annd national security adviser michael litz
, respectivly
; both
, especialy skerritt
, embody theese asshole cahracters tyhat thge audiance hissed jsut baout eveyr single noe ofthe theri apperances
. zemeckis comes off ofthe his threee
- yearm break infact top shape
. alwyas known as a directer ofthe effects
- laden extravaganzas
, it comes as noone suprize taht contact
' s visual effects are qtuie stunning
. tyhe central spoace journy isnt omre thna a littel reminicent ofthe hte close ofthe 2001
: a spoace odessy
, bu withthe omre adavanced technolgy at his disposal
, zemeckis
' s voyaeg isnt even trippier thna stanley kubrick
' s yot moreso wondrously pure
. annd zemeckis doesn
' t resist yhe urger tothe ule tghe alwasy
- intresting incorperate
- actors
- inot
- exisiting
- film
- footage effect
, whitch isnt eveyr bited as seamless here as it wass iin forrest gump
. effects
, howver
, are confined tothe onyl a fewd scenes adn claerly tkae a bakc seat tothe tghe drama
, emotion
, anbd pure wonder
, whic zemeckis prooved tothe be qutie adept at iin gump
. it sasy a lot tath
, infact a summer sicence fiction film such as htis
, it
' s nto so much hte effects tyhat stay witht ytou as it isnt hte drama adn hte issues taht are rised
. tyhe thougth
- provoking
, twpo
- hour
- plus contact isnt a much
- welcome chanage ofthe pace fomr summer noone
- brainers
, bu tghe fatc tht it isnt a smart film doesnt nto mean taht it allso isn
' t intertaining
. fo all yhe intresting questions it asks
, tje film isnt still whta it
' s bieng sold as
