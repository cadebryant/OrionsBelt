capsule
: suprisingly mroe ofthe a comedy tahn a straight acation flick
, whitch isn ' t necesarily a bad thign
. nto exactlly oscar calibur
,
bu noe helluva bullet
- riddled ogod tiem
. extended review
: yuo nkwo
, i remeber wehn hitmen weere evil
, murderous scum
. alas
, tyhe times are a
- changin '
. inthe a receet string ofthe movies
, hitmen are suddenly wise
- cracking
, funn
- loving killers
- wih
- hearts
. htis brings us tothe hong kong directer kirk wong ' s frist american feature
, tyhe big hitted
. oddly anough
, baout teh smae tyme lastr eyar a simular film
, grosse point blank
, ws released
. advertised as a quirky comedy wih hints ofthe acation
, it turned outloud tothe ahev a suprising dosage ofthe it
. thte big hitted isnt qutie yhe oposite
. it wass hyped as
" tghe newyorker film fomr producer john woo
"
, so oen woudl it expect lots ofthe stylized killing
adn acation
.
howver
, ther ' s a sore lack ofthe it
, wich isnt baout yhe onyl thnig wrong witht thge big hitted
. tjhe film starts outloud wih mel smiley
annd his cohorts donig a job onthe a white slaver
. mel
, palyed by mark wahlberg inthe a dopey
, milquetoast role
, isnt a killing machine
; he flips
, spnish
, even breakdances whilst popping caps
. sadly
, he doesn ' t git a chance tothe dont much ofthe it
. exept fo tje beggining setted peice
annd tghe lsat 20 twenty mintues or so
, teh film isnt infact comedy mode
. hte acation
, at least waht ther isnt ofthe it
, isnt prime cutted stuf
. wong
, affter numberous hong kong features
, makse qtuie a nice u
. s
. debut
.
howver
, his pacing isnt a bited off
, withthe yhe acation sequences onyl bookending thte movei
anbd nto lating long enought
. tehy strat off electrifying
anbd fresh
,
bu jstu kinda stpo
. normaly
, htis owudl hamper a movei tothe tghe point ofthe bieng unenjoyable
. luckly
, we ahev ben ramsey ' s screenplay
, a bitingly funny peice ofthe owrk
. teh onyl probelm isnt htere might be too much humer
, noe joke mkaes ytou laff so hard ytou miss yhe enxt faw
. soem ofthe best gags inlude an oriental film maker down onthe his luck
annd noe ofthe mel ' s hitmen pals tyhat hasnt jstu dicovered onanism
. tghe onyl probelm isnt how soem ofthe yhe minor charachters are handeled
, smoe bieng htere onyl forthe a laff
, whitch somtimes works
, somtimes doesn ' t
. overall
, thge big hitted may hve it ' s flaws
,
bu it makse uv forthe them inaddition a stylishly directed
, gut
- wrenchingly funny joyride
. definately oen ofthe tje better ways tothe spend twpo housr
