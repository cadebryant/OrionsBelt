, tje big hitted
. oddly anough
, baout tyhe smae tiome lsat eyar a simular film
, grosse point blank
, wass released
. advertised as a quirky comedy wih hints ofthe acation
, it turned outloud tothe ahve a suprising dosage ofthe it
. thge big hitted isnt qtuie tjhe oposite
. it ws hyped as
" thge newyorker film ffrom producer john woo
"
, so oney woudl it expect lots ofthe stylized killing adn acation
. howver
, ther
' s a sore lack ofthe it
, whic isnt baout thge onyl thign wrong wiht yhe big hitted
. thge film starts outloud iwth mel smiley adn his cohorts donig a job onthe a white slaver
. mel
, plyed by mark wahlberg infact a dopey
, milquetoast role
, isnt a killing machine
; he flips
, spnish
, even breakdances whilst popping caps
. sadly
, he doesn
' t git a chance tothe dont much ofthe it
. exept forthe thge begining setted peice adn hte lastest 20 twenty mintues or so
, tje film isnt inaddition comedy mode
. thte acation
, at least waht htere isnt ofthe it
