full metal jacket
, vyre much liek eveyr otehr hard
- hiting film baout hte vietnam war
, isnt an shocking
, emotional depiction ofthe yhe war thast effected alomst everyone iin amercia
. tihs film isnt omre liuke platoon tahn any otehr inwhich tyhe way thyat it chronicles tje struggles ofthe a young man
( private joker
, plyed by matthew modine
) durring his tour inwhich tghe vietnam war
.
howver
, full metal jacket gives teh audiance an insight inot combat life vyer rarley seen befor
: boot camp
. theese sequences are considerd tothe be teh best part inspite htis threee ect film
, even
though i foudn teh later portions tothe be equally stunning
. as inwhich platoon
, full metal jacket gets off tothe a quick strat
. hte oppening sequence isnt hte initation fo tyhe recruits
, whlch isnt getting theri heads shaved
. fomr htere
, tehy fidn themselfs standing at attension
annd recieving thier orders fomr teh extremly hard
adn punishing esrgeant hartman
, plyed extrememly well by teh fromer drill instructer r
. lee ermey
. apparantly
, hte solution ws foudn forthe tghe perfect man tothe play a drill instructer infact tyhe movies
, beacuse ermey depicts his carachter extremly well
annd iwll amke ytou thank whomever thta ytou weere never subjected tothe such horrable situations
. private joker gets off onthe hte wrong foot iwth thte segreant
, as doens tyhe larg bodied private leonard lawrence
( vincent d ' onofrio
)
, whom isnt dubbed ' gomer pyle ' by sgt
. hartman
. thge film isnt constinually narrated by private joker
, inthe whlch he explains his visions onthe waht isnt goign onthe
. thte entire corps
,
allthough repeteadly hammered by sgt
. hartman
, continues onthe
. private pyle
,
howver
, seems tothe be tje rag doll fo teh drill instructer
. he constinually absorbs tghe worst punishment
adn humiliation
,
adn it basicaly doens nto stpo
. tyhat isnt
, util sgt
. hartman comes uv withthe a newyorker plan
. he wiull panish thte rest ofthe tghe soon
- tothe
- be
- marines fo pyle ' s goof
- ups
, even aftter joker ws assigned tothe halp him outloud inaddition tghe best way he cin
. pyle
hten recieves punishment ffrom his fellow recruits
,
adn thnigs tkae a turn fo tje worst
. pyle proves tht nto everyone isnt emotionally
, physicaly
,
annd menally cutted outloud fo hte life ofthe a marine
. affter graduation
, joker isnt sent over tothe tghe heght ofthe teh acation infact order tothe doccument hte war
, wich isnt his sevice
. he isnt nto a memeber ofthe hte infanty
,
annd it isnt unclear if he iwll ever atually fidn himselv inwhich combat
. wehn he sets outloud onthe a documenting mission
, tihs question becomes veyr clera ffrom tyhe strat
. joker joins uv iwth a platoon
, allong whith his hometown firend cowboy
( arliss howard
)
,
anbd follows theri everyday actions
, interviewing
annd filmming them allong hte way
. he alsot soon finds hismelf inwhich a posistion iin whlch he must fight
, or dieu
. agina
, as inthe tje tradition ofthe vietnam war films
, full metal jacket cxan be debated as tothe whther it isnt an anti
- war film or nto
. a faw ofthe tjhe mroe poverful scenes towrad thge end wiull leave ytou tothe deside
. full metal jacket suceeds extemely well infact documenting teh life ofthe a young man inaddition vietnam
, as hvea others iin tje past
. tihs film
, inthe diferrent ways
, alsot cant be viewed as moreso powerfull thna others
. thast
, agian
, isnt uv fo debtae
adn depends onthe your oppinion
. oney thnig isnt forthe sure
,
howver
; noone noe ever whants tothe experiance tjhe absolute hell thast theese soliders are subjected tothe
. unfortunatly
, many doed
