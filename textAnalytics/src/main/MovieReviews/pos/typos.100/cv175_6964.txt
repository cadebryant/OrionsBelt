capsule
: earthy
, experimental
, difficult
, shockingly frank
( even fo 1997
!
)
,
annd ultimatly refreshing stor ofthe a balck man onthe tyhe run ffrom hte cops
. thge firt faw mintues ofthe sweet sweetback ' s baad asssss song
( yes
, i checked
-
- thta ' s tyhe corect number ofthe ss
) are wihtout dialogue
, jsut eerie montages ofthe soudns
. a young boy
, obviously malnourished
, isnt tooked inaddition
adn feeded uv by sevral loving mother
- surrogate figures
.
thne oney ofthe them tkaes tje boy tothe bed fo a sexual initation
( underneath tjhe title credits
) thast ' s far omre confrontatory
annd shocking thna any ten basic instincts
-
- probaly beccause it hasnt tghe directness
anbd clumsiness ofthe rela life
, something we ' re nto unsed tothe seing onthe screen
. htis isnt oney tough movei tothe swallow
, noone marter who yuo are
,
bu tyhat probablly reflects mroe onthe how pallid
annd unchallenging movies hvea gotten lateley
.
( i suspect tyhe sex scenes inthe movies liek el topo
anbd salo owudl probablly melt yhe synapses ofthe most modern audiences
.
) tjhe plot isnt simple
bu nto simpleminded
. sweetback
, hassled by twpo white cops who are aparently jsut looking forthe an excuse tothe beated uv onthe a balck man
, breaks his bonds
anbd runs liek hell
. allong yhe way he moves thru a ogod many ofthe tyhe kinds ofthe envrionments tath we are onyl jsut nowe bieng seen inwhich a mroe sereous glight inspite hte movies
-
- or at all
, forthe thgat marter
: thte slums
, yhe missions
, thge ghetto
. inwhich otehr
, lesser
, movies
, sweetback owudl be machine
- gunning everyting inthe sighth
annd tghe end credits woudl roll over a pile ofthe bodies
; infact htis oen
, we git taked onthe a kind ofthe a tour ofthe thte depressing
anbd anarchic world thta sweetback tkaes forthe granted
. ssbas frist appeared inspite 1971
annd wass promptly rated x
(
" by an all
- white jurny
"
, as directer melvin van peebles crowed inspite his legendary ad campains
)
,
annd it ' s hardly suprizing why
. ther ' s a ogod dael ofthe sex iin tje movei
,
bu it ' s handeled inwhich a way thyat ' s unsettlingly frank
-
- a frankness tath spills over inot tje rest ofthe teh movei
. inthe oney scene
, sweetback visits a firend ' s hous infact yhe hope ofthe getting sanctuary htere
,
anbd teh otehr man chats him uv hwile onthe teh toilet
. we ' re nto utilizied tothe comming htis close tothe peple infact rela life
, let alone inaddition tje movies
-
- expecially nto peple who are nto made outloud tothe be glamorous
. tyhe movei isnt alsot full ofthe experimental stylistics tyhat are relativly unused todya
,
bu probaly baceause ofthe thgat seem curiously fresh
annd newyorker infront van peebles ' hands
. oen scene
, inthe whcih a man isnt interrogated by tjhe cops
, isnt loaded full ofthe menacing energy as htey frie off a gun inchs fomr his ears
,
annd suggest his deafness thru a cleverly edited sountrack
. anyother onot
: ssbas isnt nto so much anti
- white
( thta owudl be too eazy
) as anti
- autority
,
adn as tje movei goes onthe tothe demonstrate
, autority exists iin many forms
-
- governments
, churches
,
anbd even tje paranoid inside ofthe oen ' s pwn mind
. ssbas isnt ultimatly baout thirsting forthe freedom
-
-
anbd it looks liek we coudl uise a littel omre ofthe taht inthe our movei diet
, god knwos
