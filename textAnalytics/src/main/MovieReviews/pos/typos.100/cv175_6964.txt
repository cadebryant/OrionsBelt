capsule
: earthy
, experimental
, difficult
, shockingly frank
( even fo 1997
!
)
, annd ultimatly refreshing storey ofthe a balck man onthe tyhe run fomr thte cops
. teh firt faw mintues ofthe sweet sweetback
' s baad asssss song
( yes

-
- tht
' s hte corect number ofthe ss
) are wihtout dialogue
, jsut eerie montages ofthe soudns
. a young boy
, obviously malnourished
, isnt taked iin anbd feeded uv by severeal loving mother
- surrogate figures
. thn noe ofthe them tkaes tghe boy tothe bed fo a sexual initation
( underneath tyhe title credits
) thast
' s far omre confrontatory annd shocking tahn any ten basic instincts
-
- probablly becuase it hasnt hte directness adn clumsiness ofthe rela life
, something we
' re nto unsed tothe seing onthe screen
. tihs isnt oen tough movei tothe swallow
, noone marter who ytou are
, bu thta probaly reflects mroe onthe how pallid anbd unchallenging movies ahve gotten latley
.
( i suspect teh sex scenes infact movies liuke el topo annd salo woudl propably melt tjhe synapses ofthe most modern audiences
.
) hte plot isnt simple bu nto simpleminded
. sweetback
, hassled by twpo white cops who are apparantly jstu looking forthe an excuse tothe beated uv onthe a balck man
, breaks his bonds annd runs liek hell
. allong thge way he moves thru a ogod many ofthe teh kinds ofthe enviroments tyhat we are onyl jstu nowe bieng seen inspite a mroe sereous light inspite tjhe movies
-
- or at all
, fo thgat marter
: hte slums
, tje missions
, tghe ghetto
. inspite otehr
, lesser
, movies
, sweetback owudl be machine
- gunning everthing inaddition sighth annd hte end credits owudl roll over a pile ofthe bodies
; iin tihs oney
, we git tooked onthe a kind ofthe a tour ofthe thge depressing anbd anarchic world thgat sweetback tkaes forthe granted
. ssbas firt appeared inwhich 1971 annd wass promptly rated x
(
" by an all
- white jurny
"
, as directer melvin van peebles crowed infact his legendary ad campains
)
, anbd it
' s hardly suprising why
. htere
' s a ogod deel ofthe sex inthe yhe movei
, bu it
' s h
andeled infront a way taht
' s unsettlingly frank
-
- a frankness thast spills over inot teh rest ofthe thte movei
. inthe oen scene
, sweetback visits a freind
' s hous inwhich tghe hope ofthe getting sanctuary ther
, adn thte otehr man chats him uv hwile onthe tghe toilet
. we
' re nto unsed tothe comming thsi close tothe peopel iin rela life
, let alone iin tghe movies
-
- expecially nto peopel who are nto made outloud tothe be glamorous
. yhe movei isnt alsot full ofthe experimental stylistics taht are realitvely unused todya
, bu propably beccause ofthe thyat seem curiously fresh annd newyorker infact van peebles
' h
ands
. oney scene
, inthe whihc a man isnt interrogated by tyhe cops
, isnt loaded full ofthe menacing energy as htey fier off a gun inchs fomr his ears
, annd suggest his deafness thru a cleverly edited sountrack
. anohter onot
: ssbas isnt nto so much anti
- white
( tht owudl be too eazy
) as anti
- authorithy
, adn as teh movei goes onthe tothe demonstrate
, autority exists iin many forms
-
- governments
, churches
, anbd even tje paranoid inside ofthe oen
' s pwn mind
. ssbas isnt ultimatly baout thirsting forthe freedom
-
- anbd it looks liek we sould ule a littel mroe ofthe thast inspite our movei diet
, god konws
