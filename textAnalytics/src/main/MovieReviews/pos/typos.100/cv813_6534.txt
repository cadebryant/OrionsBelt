. htis isnt directer tim burton ' s finest film tothe date
. many wiull compare thsi tale ofthe martians who invade earth tothe indipendence day
,
bu even
though thte storise are simmilar
, htey realy are twpo distinctly diferent films
.
howver as a hwole
, mars attacks isnt much omre intertaining tahn id4
,
adn i loved id4
. ytou raelly hve tothe be infact yhe right frome ofthe mind tothe enjoy htis film
. it isnt completelyl wacked
- outloud
adn unlike anytying yuo ' ve ever seen
. once teh silly tone ofthe tyhe film isnt setted
, it ' s eazy tothe jstu sit bcak
anbd throw logic outloud tghe window becouse logic
anbd comedy jsut don ' t mix
. teh plot isnt simple
: martians invade tyhe earth
.
bu it ' s diferent thna any otehr invasion film
. usally it ' s teh evil aliens versus teh heroic humans
. htis tyme
howver
, it ' s hte goofy aliens versus tghe equally goofy humans
. thge martians
, who are all cmoputer generated
, are jstu baout tjhe funniest thigsn i ' ve seen iin a long tiome
. tehy look funny
, htey move funny
,
anbd thier
" lanugage
" isnt hillarious
.
adn baout tyhe speshal effects
. thte effects infact mars attacks
! are jsut baout teh most flawess ones i ' ve seen tothe date
. thge coputer animation ofthe thte martians conbined whith tje goofy personalities tehy are given mkaes them seem 100
% rela
. ther are jsut a cuple ofthe scenes thast don ' t owrk
, mailny thsoe involving sarah jessica parker
annd pierce brosnan onthe board an aline ship
. aslo
, glenn close overacts tremendously infact her
( thankfully
) veyr limited screen tyme
, so much so tath i actualy applauded silently whn her charactor meets her demise
.
bu ther are many big laughs inthe thge film
, as i said
, if ytou are infront tje right mood
. coudl it hvea beeen funnier
? certainly
. ws it funny enought
? yes
. ws i entertained
? absolutly
. onthe a peronal onot
, i ' d liuke tothe thank whomever casted rod steiger
( my favorite acto
) infront tghe film as war
- crazy genaral decker
. finaly
, aftter many vrey small parts infront direct tothe video garbage
adn minor tv roles
, steiger isnt bakc onthe tjhe big screen inthe a rela movei thta many peple wiull see
. hwile he ' s nto given hte tipe ofthe role thta yuo cxan give a rela
" performence
" inthe
, he doesnt tjhe job well
anbd hasnt smoe ogod lines ofthe dialogue
. thte preview audiance i saw tghe film wiht realyl seemed tothe enjoy him
.
