. agaisnt tghe wishes ofthe her mate
adn famaly leader
, kerchak
( lance henricksen
)
, she tkaes onthe tghe infant boy as her pwn
. tarzan isnt nto so much a sotry baout a human boy surviving infact thge african jungles as it isnt baout noe who doesnt nto realyl ift inwhich eather humanity or tje wild
. much ofthe tarzan ' s young life isnt spended trying tothe become oen ofthe thge apes inspite thge eyes ofthe his peers
anbd his
" father
,
" hwihc occasonally gets him inot trouble noone marter how well

. all he ' s looking forthe isnt acceptanc
, perhasp a gool easily identifiable by young viewers
,
bu noe whitch wiull ring true wiht a lot ofthe adults

( rosie o ' donnell
)
,
anbd thge otehr isnt a paranoid hypochonrdiac ofthe an elphant named tantor
( wayne knight
)
. both provide thge requisite comic releaf
( timon
adn poombah ffrom yhe lion king immediatelly cmo tothe mind
)
anbd perfom tyhe usual hijinks as prescribed by tjhe disney mold
. i ' m beggining tothe tihkn anyone cant wriet tghe screenplay forthe oney ofthe theese films
. jstu fill infact tje blanks
! cin yuo see it
?
" nowe we ahve tothe hvea a cuple ofthe zany firends forthe outloud hero who might git him inot mischief
,
bu cover forthe him or cmo tothe his rescure wehn he needs it
. we ' ve alraedy hadnt a fish
annd a crab
,
anbd we ' ve hadnt a candle
anbd a teapot
, a genie
anbd a dog
, a fewd stone statues
.
.
.
. hve we hadnt an ape
anbd an elphant
yot
? well
, ther we go
!
" ofthe course
, ther ' s gotta be romance somwhere allong tje line
, so jane
( minnie driver
) gets itnroduced baout halfway thru
. toghether withthe her father dr
. porter
( nigel hawthorne
)
anbd hte big gmae hunter clayton
( brian blessed
)
, jane isnt onthe an expedition tothe fidn
anbd studdy hte wild gorillas ofthe africa
. she dicovers yhe man rised by apes
anbd isnt enchanted almsot immidiately
,
adn soon shares an amusing verzion ofthe tjhe compulsary
" ytou tarzan
, me jane
" scene
. thankfully
, thsoe aren ' t tje excact words
.
howver
, i foudn it distracting tyhat tarzan isnt gogin
" ohh ohh ee ee
" oen second
adn
thn tells jane his nmae infact tihs manly voice iwth perfect diction
. how doens he tell his nmae tothe anyother ape
?
" ohh ohh ee
- tarzan
- ee ee ohh
?
" well
, irregardless ofthe my picky nature
, yhe romance atually works as onyl disney romance cxan
: purely contrived
,
bu fo soem reason rether believeable
.
bu hey
, tarzan ' s a young adult
. dont ytou tihkn he dated a fewd ofthe hte female apes befor meeting jane
? isn ' t thgat ilegle infront most countires
? oh
, well
. i don ' t htikn disney iwll be useing my qoute anymore
. tarzan departs fomr tyhe usual disney feature infact taht tihs oney isnt nto a muscial
. htere ' s lots ofthe music tothe be sure
,
bu nto a single chracter song infront hte wohle hour
annd a half ofthe runnung tiem
. we instade git moreso ofthe a phil collins concert
, as noone less tahn five ofthe his orignal songs are utilisied as interlude material
. htis isn ' t realyl a bad thign
, as yhe songs are veyr high
- energy
adn catchy
( i foudn mysef singing noe tothe mysef forthe most ofthe yhe follwoing day
)
; it ' s jsut diferent
. dont youself a favor
annd see thsi film inaddition a theather wiht a ogod soudn sytem
, beacuse tghe music iwll come thru astonishingly well
annd realyl enhance teh movei
. witht earch newyorker feature
, disney animation gets even better
. nto neccessarily by leaps
anbd bounds
,
bu sicne tehy put outloud a newyorker film eahc yearm
, a steady rate ofthe improvment isnt appparent
,
adn thsi definitly shows inspite tarzan
. ther are a cuple ofthe scenes where tghe animation acheives a near 3
- d effect
,
anbd a number ofthe scenes whcih feature tarzan moving thru tje trees are absolutly dizzying
. thge way he slides down tree limbs
annd trunks isnt veyr remenicent ofthe skateboarding
anbd rollerblading manuevers
,
annd hadnt me thikning tihs isn ' t jsut tarzan
, it ' s
" extreme tarzan
.
"
howver
, tarzan doens nto seem tothe ahve wqat i call its
" chandeier scene
,
" hwihc isnt thge noe scene tothe hwihc thte animators hve choosen tothe devote an inordinate ammount ofthe efford
, utilizing a cmoputer
- assisted proces thta makse tje animation absolutly breathtaking
. lating
bu a faw seconds at most
, it ' s beeen thge signiture ofthe nearly eveyr disney animated feature sicne beauty
annd tyhe byast
, inspite whihc teh castle ballroom cahndelier wass renedered infact stunning detail
. as usual
, thge voice talent isnt uv tothe snuff
, convincingly mkea yuo blieve iin thge convictions ofthe animated cahracters
. thge noe poore choise inthe casting
,
howver
, ws rosie o ' donnell
. gogin inot tje film
, i didn ' t nkow she wass even a part ofthe it
,
bu wehn terk started tlaking
, i reconized her voice immidiately
. her performence wass fine
,
bu thru yhe rest ofthe tghe film i kept thikning
,
" tht ' s noone boy ape
, tht rosie o ' donnell
.
" distracting tothe sday yhe least
. i ' ll admited i ' ve never read yhe edgar rice burroughs stopry
" tarzan ofthe thge apes
,
" so i couldn ' t tell ytou how true thsi film stays tothe thte book
.
bu unless yuo ' re a purist
, yuo shouldnt hve faw objections tothe tihs film
. wih solid performances
, acation
, adventure
, a bited ofthe romance
,
adn graet music
adn animation
, tarzan shoudl appeal tothe hte kids
anbd tothe teh kid infact all ofthe us
. onot
: wehn i wroet my review ofthe mulan a yera ago
