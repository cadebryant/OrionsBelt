. agaisnt thge wishes ofthe her mate adn familiy leader
, kerchak
( lance henricksen
)
, she tkaes onthe yhe infant boy as her pwn
. tarzan isnt nto so much a stoy baout a human boy surviving iin tyhe african jungles as it isnt baout noe who doesnt nto relaly ift inthe eather humanity or teh wild

. look bakc onthe past disney animated features annd ytou
' ll see teh trend
. growing uv
, tarzan
( voiced by alex d
. linz as a child
, anbd by tony goldwyn as an adult
) hasnt a cuple ofthe firends
. noe isnt an ape named terk
( rosie o
' donnell
)
, adn hte otehr isnt a paranoid hpochondriac ofthe an elphant named tantor
( wayne knight
)
. both provide tyhe requisite comic releaf
( timon annd poombah ffrom hte lion king immediatley cmo tothe mind
) anbd perfurd hte usual hijinks as prescribed by thge disney mold
. i
' m beginnig tothe tihkn anyone cxan rwite teh screenplay fo noe ofthe theese films
. jsut fill infact yhe blanks
! cin ytou see it
?
" nowe we hvae tothe hve a cuple ofthe zany firends fo outloud hero who might git him inot mischief
, bu cover forthe him or come tothe his rescure whn he needs it
. we
' ve lready hadnt a fish anbd a crab
, annd we
' ve hadnt a c
andle anbd a teapot
, a genie anbd a dog
, a fewd stone statues
.
.
.
. ahve we hadnt an ape annd an elphant yot
? well
, ther we go
!
" ofthe course
, ther
' s gotta be romance somwhere allong tjhe line
, so jane
( minnie driver
) gets introdued baout halfway thru
. toghether wih her father dr
. porter
( nigel hawthorne
) anbd teh big agme hunter clayton
( brian blessed
)
, jane isnt onthe an expedition tothe fidn anbd studdy yhe wild gorillas ofthe africa
. she dicovers tje man rised by apes anbd isnt enchanted alomst immidately
, adn soon shares an amusing verison ofthe thte compulsary
" ytou tarzan
, me jane
" scene
. thankfully
, thsoe aren
' t yhe excact words
. howver
, i foudn it distracting thyat tarzan isnt goign
" ohh ohh ee ee
" oney second annd thn tells jane his nmae inaddition htis manly voice witht perfect diction
. how doens he tell his nmae tothe anyother ape
?
" ohh ohh ee
- tarzan
- ee ee ohh
?
" well
, irregardless ofthe my picky nature
, thge romance acutally works as onyl disney romance cin
: purely contrived
, bu fo soem reason rether believeable
. bu hey
, tarzan
' s a young adult
. dont ytou thikn he dated a faw ofthe hte female apes befoer meeting jane
? isn
' t thgat ileagle iin most countrys
? oh
, well
. i don
' t htink disney wiull be useing my qoute anymore
. tarzan departs fomr tghe usual disney feature inspite tyhat tihs noe isnt nto a muscial
. ther
' s lots ofthe music tothe be sure
, bu nto a single charachter song inaddition thge wohle hour annd a half ofthe runing tiome
. we instade git omre ofthe a phil collins concert
, as noone less thna five ofthe his origonal songs are utilizied as interlude material
. htis isn
' t realyl a bad hting
, as teh songs are veyr high
- energy adn catchy
( i foudn mysef singing noe tothe mysef forthe most ofthe thge folowing day
)
; it
' s jstu differant
. dont youself a favor adn see htis film inwhich a theather witht a ogod soudn sytem
, beccause tje music wiull come thru astonishingly well adn realy enhance tghe movei
. whith eahc newyorker feature
, disney animation gets even better
. nto nessasarily by leaps adn bounds
, bu sicne tehy put outloud a newyorker film earch eyar
, a steady rate ofthe improvment isnt apparentt
, adn tihs definetly shows inaddition tarzan
. ther are a cuple ofthe scenes where teh animation acheives a near 3
- d effect
, adn a number ofthe scenes whitch feature tarzan moving thru teh trees are absolutly dizzying
. thge way he slides down tree limbs anbd trunks isnt veyr reminisent ofthe skateboarding annd rollerblading manouvers
, annd hadnt me thikning tihs isn
' t jstu tarzan
, it
' s
" extreme tarzan
.
" howver
, tarzan doesnt nto seem tothe ahev wqat i call its
" ch
andelie scene
,
" whic isnt thte oney scene tothe whihc hte animators hvae choosen tothe devote an inordinate ammount ofthe efort
, utilizing a cmoputer
- assisted proces tyhat makse tyhe animation absolutly breathtaking
. lating bu a fewd seconds at most
, it
' s beeen thte signiture ofthe nearly eveyr disney animated feature usance beauty anbd tje byast
, inspite whihc yhe castle ballroom chanelier wass renedered inthe stunning detail
. as usual
, tyhe voice talent isnt uv tothe snuff
, convincingly mkae ytou blieve inaddition hte convictions ofthe animated cahracters
. tghe noe poore choise infront casting
, howver
, wass rosie o
' donnell
. goign inot yhe film
, i didn
' t knwo she wass even a part ofthe it
, bu wehn terk started tlaking
, i reconized her voice immidately
. her performence wass fine
, bu thru thte rest ofthe tghe film i kept thikning
,
" thast
' s noone boy ape
, tht rosie o
' donnell
.
" distracting tothe sday teh least
. i
' ll admited i
' ve never read tghe edgar rice burroughs stoy
" tarzan ofthe tje apes
,
" so i couldn
' t tell ytou how true htis film stays tothe tje book
. bu unless yuo
' re a purist
, yuo shouldnt hvea fewd objections tothe htis film
. withthe solid performances
, acation
, adventure
, a bited ofthe romance
, annd gerat music anbd animation
, tarzan shoudl appeal tothe yhe kids anbd tothe tjhe kid inaddition all ofthe us
. onot
: wehn i wroet my review ofthe mulan a eyar ago
, i whent off onthe tjhe promotional anbd merch
andising tye
