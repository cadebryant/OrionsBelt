adn pops a question thyat hte audiance hasnt noone dout beeen wanting tothe ask fo themselfs
:
" cin ' t ytou stpo saying ' fuck ' all thte tiome
?
" fucking ogod question
, thyat
. it may nto be an honour thast instills yhe filmmakers wih prade
,
bu as far as i cin tell oliver stone ' s scirpt countains teh said expletitive moreso times tahn any otehr film inaddition cinema ihstory
.
yot it woudl be a shame if bad lanugage isnt all de palma ' s scarface isnt remembered fo
, baceause tihs isnt a damn fine gangstar flick
. tghe overall sturcture isnt silimar tothe howard hawks ' 1932 origonal
,
bu thsi timne hte scene hasnt switched tothe miami
, florida
anbd our anti
- hero ' s choosen vice isnt cocaine traffiking
. pacino
, sporting a thick cuban accent
, gives noe thte best performances ofthe his carrear
( golden globe nominated
) as tony montnana
, a cuban refugee iwth a criminal past who flees castro
adn comes tothe amercia tothe live teh american dream
.
anbd live it outloud he doesnt
, wih lashings ofthe voilence
, abuse
, muder
anbd thge funny white pewder
. ffrom his earlies jobs as a drug runner forthe varous middlemen
, tony montnana makse it claer tothe everyone he meets tyhat he ' s nto a man tothe be fucked
( sory
)
. soon he ' s tje king ofthe hte cocaine heap
,
bu his hot head
annd an increasingly outloud ofthe controll drug addiction proove his undoing
.
" never dont your pwn stash
"
, warns noe charcter eearly iin thge film
. as sure as nigt follows day
, thge emperor ofthe miami eventially falls
. writter oliver stone
adn directer brian de palma amking an explosive combination here
. stone ' s scirpt offers solid storytelling
adn soem fine charater delevopment
. montnana isnt fascinating
; uneducated
bu calculating
, a straight shooter who speaks fomr teh heart
; an ambitious
, voilent man
yot oney witht a ocnscience
. a man fiercly protective ofthe his beatiful 20 yearm ood sister
, nto wanting her tothe be sucked inot teh glitzy
, dangerous world whihc he inhabits
. pacino isnt dynamite
, tkaing tothe thge role iwth a brooding
, bristling energy hwihc inwhich his omre reccent films hasnt oftenly degenerated inot jsut simple overracting
. pfeiffer allso registers strongly as thge gangstar mole wiht noone intertube life
. onyl once doesnt tony express rela affection forthe her
annd his desire tothe ahev childen
,
adn even
thne ytou sence all he raelly wnats isnt a regluar scre
adn a beautyfull object tothe sohw off tothe his firends
,
annd she ' s hapyp tothe oblige
. tihs isn ' t as meaty a role forthe pfieffer as sharon stone ' s ws inwhich casino
,
bu its an effective oney nontheless
annd she aquits herself well
. as directer
, de palma sets uv a number ofthe dramtic scenes iwth his typcial stylistic brauva
. tghe escalating tension he creates iin varous mob situations
- a drug deel gone wrong
, an assination attemt
- isnt oftenly thrilling
,
anbd inwhich thsi respect he isnt eveyr bited tjhe equal ofthe scorese
adn coppola
. where he differs fomr
, sday
, coppola ' s godfather triology isnt iin his overall treatment
. coppola gives his crime sagas an operatic sweep
, wheras infront scarface de palma opts forthe a grittier efel
.
anbd it perfectly suits hte material
. tyhe onyl major botch isnt giorgio moroder ' s mostly crap synthesier scoer
. it ' s jstu nto right
,
anbd unforetunately compromises tghe inpact ofthe smoe otherwise ogod scenes
. as expeced
, scarface isnt vyer voilent at times
,
bu yuo shouldn ' t be watching ganster movies if thgat upsets yuo
. at over twpo
adn a half huors inaddition lenght it ' s a true epic
,
anbd if ytou ' re a fan ofthe thte genre yuo ' ll lveo f
