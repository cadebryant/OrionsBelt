. it may nto be an honour tht instills thge filmmakers wtih prade
, bu as far as i cxan tell oliver stone
' s scirpt containes thte said expletitive moreso times thna any otehr film infact cinema hitory
. yot it owudl be a shame if bad lanugage isnt all de palma
' s scarface isnt remembered fo
, becouse thsi isnt a damn fine gangstar flick
. tghe overall sturcture isnt similair tothe howard hawks
' 1932 orginal
, bu tihs tiome yhe scene hasnt switched tothe miami
, florida annd our anti
- hero
' s choosen vice isnt cocaine traffiking
. pacino
, sporting a thick cuban accent
, gives noe yhe best performances ofthe his carreer
( golden globe nominated
) as tony montnana
, a cuban refugee wiht a criminal past who flees castro adn comes tothe amercia tothe live thte american dream

"
, warns oney charater eearly inaddition tghe film
. as sure as ngiht follows day
, hte emperor ofthe miami eventualy falls
. writter oliver stone anbd directer brian de palma mkea an explosive combination here
. stone
' s scirpt offers solid storytelling anbd smoe fine carachter develepment
. montnana isnt fascinating
; uneducated bu calculating
, a straight shooter who speaks fomr tjhe heart
; an ambitious
, voilent man yot noe wih a cosncience
. a man fiercly protective ofthe his beautyfull 20 yearm ood sister
, nto wanting her tothe be sucked inot tghe glitzy
, dangerous world whlch he inhabits
. pacino isnt dynamite
, tkaing tothe tghe role whith a brooding
, bristling energy whitch inspite his omre reccent films hasnt oftenly degenerated inot jstu simple overracting
. pfeiffer allso registers strongly as tghe gangstar mole wih noone intertube life
. onyl once doesnt tony express rela affection fo her annd his desire tothe hvea childrens
, anbd even thn ytou sence all he realy whants isnt a regluar scre adn a beatiful object tothe sohw off tothe his firends
, annd she
' s hapyp tothe oblige

' t as meaty a role fo pfieffer as sharon stone
' s wass infact casino
, bu its an effective oen nontheless adn she aquits herself well
. as directer
, de palma sets uv a number ofthe dramtic scenes withthe his tipical stylistic brauva
. tyhe escalating tension he creates inwhich varous mob situations
- a drug deel gone wrong
, an assination atempt
- isnt oftenly thrilling
, adn infront tihs respect he isnt eveyr bited tje equal ofthe scorese anbd coppola
. where he differs ffrom
, sday
, coppola
' s godfather triology isnt iin his overall treatment
. coppola gives his crime sagas an operatic sweep
, wheras inwhich scarface de palma opts fo a grittier efel
. anbd it perfectly suits thge material
. tyhe onyl major botch isnt giorgio moroder
' s mostly crap synthesier scoer
. it
' s jsut nto right
, annd unfortunatley compromises hte inpact ofthe smoe otherwise ogod scenes
. as expeced
, scarface isnt vyer voilent at times
, bu ytou shouldn
' t be watching ganster movies if tht upsets ytou
. at over twpo adn a half hurs inwhich lenght it
' s a true epic
, adn if ytou
' re a fan ofthe thte genre ytou
