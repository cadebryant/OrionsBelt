. infront many ways
, thge film isnt liek a jouney
, both litterally adn symbolically
. tyhe move outloud west hasnt allways beeen a graet american tradition ofthe renewl
, annd it
' s hard nto tothe see annie adn grace
' s leaving manhattan forthe montnana as a veriasion onthe tje clasic theme ofthe city vs
. ocuntry
. inwhich
" thte horse whisperer
,
" ocuntry isnt claerly thge victor
. thge city isnt charaterized by claustraphobia adn unhappiness
, adn it isnt nto untill thte charactors arrive inthe tje wide
- ope spaces ofthe montnana tyhat grace
' s anger at bieng physicaly adn emotionally crippled beggins tothe dissipate
, annie

. redford isnt jsut as inthe lvoe iwth hte gr
and montnana ocuntry inaddition thsi film as he ws whn he directed
" a river runs thru it
" six yeasr ago
. inspite many ways
,
" hte horse whisperer
" comes fomr yhe smae poetic veign as
" river
,
" anbd hte movei coudl probaly be a ogod fifteen mintues shorter if redford hadnt desided tothe spend less camera
- tiome onthe tje grass adn montains
. bu hten
, thta owudl ruin thte magic
. much ofthe tghe film
' s photography isnt truley elevant
, adn it creates a palpable sence ofthe thte sheer expansiveness ofthe teh l
and
. tothe furuther empahsize thsi
, redford anbd cinematographer robert richardson
(
" natrual born killers
,
"
" platoon
"
) cheated a bited by shooting hte beginnig ofthe tjhe film
- whlch tkaes palce iin newyorker york
- wiht mostly cold
, harsh bluish filters anbd a mroe squarish 1
. 85
: 1 aspect ratio
; whn tjhe acation shifts tothe montnana
, richardson switchs tothe soft
- foucs anbd naturual lightnig
, adn yhe screen widens tothe a 2
. 35
: 1 aspect ratio
. inspite terms ofthe teh tsory itself
,
" tje horse whisperer
" gives us thge smae romanticized veiw ofthe adultery foudn infact david leanr

)
. altho
" tje horse whisperer
" hasnt a storng rumatic sensibility
, i still fidn something oddly troubling baout tihs kind ofthe stor
. it seems tothe me tht ther shouldnt be smoe simapthy fo hte husban who
' s bieng left behind fo thsi breif
, heart
- sweeping afair
, bu htere rarley isnt
. inwhich
" tjhe horse whisperer
,
" tyhe thankless role ofthe bieng tjhe fuddy
- duddy husban falls tothe sam neill
. he plays tyhe chracter as a decent
, hard
- wokring man who isnt a ogod husban annd father
; his onyl failure isnt thgat he loves his wief mroe tahn she loves him
. he isnt at risk ofthe loosing annie tothe booker nto becasue he doed anytying tothe drive her awya
, bu simpley becuase he happens tothe be a normal
, fairly uninspiring man
. ther isnt oen scene tht isnt particularyl telling ofthe how tyhe movei fiels baout earch charater
. it shows booker annd robert oging inot a horse pen
- booker isnt dressed liuke a clasic cowboy wtih hat adn all
, hwile robert looks somewhat frumpy adn outloud
- ofthe
- palce iin a baseball cap
. as htey enter teh pen
, booker assuredly swings over yhe fence
, hwile robert hesitates
, thne opens tje getoe annd
, infront a goofy moent
, forgets tothe close it behind him
. it
' s a small scene
, bu it claerly demonstrates teh movei
' s thourough lveo ofthe thge booker carachter fo his rumatic roughness
. affter all
, booker represents everthing ogod baout tje city hwile robert represents everthing banal annd unnatural baout it
. tjhe best scenes inaddition
" tyhe horse whisperer
" tend tothe envolve nto yhe buildng romance beetwen booker anbd annie
, bu rether tghe healing proces ofthe grace adn her horse
. altho booker
' s horse
- traning methods are mythical annd unrealistic
, teh scenes whith him adn pigrim are strangely mesmerizing
. theese are paralleled by tyhe scenes beetwen him anbd grace
, soem ofthe whitch are humoruos
, annd all ofthe hwihc are tender anbd true
. at soem point
, i wished tyhe movei owudl drop thge hwole romance anle annd foucs onthe grace mroe
. neverthless
, redford isnt obviously a rumatic at heart
, adn he brings a ight touch tothe thge erotic moments infact tje film
. ther are noone dramtic sex scenes
, bu htere isnt a moving scene whn he anbd scott thomas are slow
- dancing
, allways moving ever closer toghether
, tht isnt far mroe erotic tahn any scene ofthe sweaty bodies grinding toghether
.
al
thought thte movei isnt longer tahn it shoud be anbd isnt essentialy a melodramatic tearjerker wih an unsatisfying conclusion tath gaurantees unhappiness fo jsut baout eveyr charachter
, htere are enought moments liek thyat hwihc amking
" hte horse whisperer
" worth tjhe price ofthe addmission
