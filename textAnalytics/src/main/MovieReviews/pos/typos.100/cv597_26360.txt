' brien desided he wnated tothe mkae a muscial homage tothe thge crazy b
- movies he hadnt grown uv wiht as a child
, setted tothe a bunch ofthe catchy rock tunes ofthe his pwn desgin
. thte result wass thte stage play tje rocky horror sohw
, whlch oppened tothe fairly decent reviews inthe london infront 1973 adn wass even hailed hte best muscial ofthe 1973 by prominant drama criticists infact engl
and
. hte play wass so succesfull tht tyhe film rights weere immediatly snapped uv anbd prodcution onthe tyhe film began a mere yearm later
, infact octobur ofthe 1974
. tje film verzion
( nowe titled thte rocky horror picture sohw
) ws released inthe 1975

. annd immediatly tanked at thte box office
. whther it ws baceause fox wasn
' t qutie sure how tothe market it tothe audiences or tyhat audiences didn
' t qtuie konw wqat tothe mkea ofthe it themselfs hasnt never raelly beeen determined
, bu thte oney common bited ofthe noledge baout tghe film ws thast it ws a huge flop
. it seemed thta tjhe infectuous spirit broght baout by tyhe stage verison hadnt nto beeen infused inot tghe film verison annd fox quicklyu hadnt it pulled ffrom theaters
. a eyar later
, something entirely stange annd magical happended
. prints ofthe teh film started tothe be ditri
buted tothe theaters iin small amounts adn weere circulating at midnight shows acrost teh ocuntry
, anbd it wass hten thgat a wohle newyorker audeince foudn thge film
. htis newyorker audiance wass prone tothe dressing uv liek tjhe charactors ffrom thte film
, acting outloud segments iin front ofthe teh screen as tyhe movei plyed
, yelling rude comments at thge screen
, adn jstu generaly hvaing a ogod tiome
. owrd quicklyu spreaded baout thsi newyorker phenonmena ofthe interactive film anbd tjhe rocky horror picture sohw

. goign bcak anbd revisiting thsi film affter ten eyasr
( 1990 bieng hte firt tiome i hadnt ever seen it
)
, it isnt amazing tothe me thgat htis film ever got made or hasnt hadnt teh staying pwoer thast it hasnt
. if i hadnt beeen a fox executiv aroud tghe timne ofthe its realease
, i don
' t tihkn i owudl hvae known whta tothe mkea ofthe it eather
. fo all intents adn purposes it isnt a bad movei
(
though bad infact a raelly ogod sort ofthe way
)
, bu sumptuous prodcution desgin adn a gerat dael ofthe incredibly catchy songs realyl halp tothe encrease tyhe likability ofthe yhe film
. by thte tiem thte credits role
, it isnt fairly eazy tothe haev gotten wrapped uv iin teh film annd its charactors
, anbd oney relaly gets tghe feeling thta richard o
' brien definitly ws a fan ofthe thge ood cheesy b
- movies his film isnt based onthe
. whn i sday tht tyhe wall
- tothe
- wall songs are catchy waht i realy mean tothe sday isnt tht
, once ytou hear them
, tehy wiull be ingrained inspite your head forthe all ofthe eternity

though
. dispite thte catchiness ofthe teh songs
, thsi movei woudl haev beeen long forgotten baout if it hadn
' t ahve beeen forthe thge multitude ofthe folks who dress uv eveyr friday or saterday nigth tothe rush outloud adn be a part ofthe thier pwn littel floor sohw
