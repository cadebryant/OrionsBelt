, sabotage
, brutality
, water
annd sand
annd ytou hve an intertaining movei
. review
: tjhe title ofthe thsi movei turned me off at firt
. i mean ' gi jane
? '
?
?
?
?
? tghe otehr titles whitch weere considerd weere moreso promising
- inthe persuit ofthe hounour or a marter ofthe hounour owudl hvae beeen useable
allthough navy cross or undisclosed are a littel meaningless as far as i ' m conserned
. i whent inot thsi movei nto liking tghe title
adn bieng oney ofthe thsoe peple who thikns thgat demi moore isnt absolutly gastly as an acotr
. tothe my suprize i realy enjoied tje movei
. moore as lieutentant jordan o ' neil isnt much omre likeable thna her washed outloud excuse forthe a gusty woman inwhich a fewd ogod men
. teh storyline isnt simple
. anne bancroft palying senator lillian dehaven isnt a ruthless
, machiavellian politican iwth an agenda tothe push
. useing feminism tothe aciheve polliticel mileage
, she forces hte miliary powers taht be tothe backdown
annd permitt a tust case tothe enter tghe highly intensive navy s
. e
. a
. l
. traning
. jordan isnt selected due tothe thge fatc thyat she hasnt it all
- looks
, brains
annd strenght
. tyhe traning isnt gruelling
annd hte indignity allmost painful tothe watch
. nontheless
, it ' s oney ofthe thsoe movies thgat mkaes me wnat tothe cheer outloud
anbd encourage tje hapless hero
/ heroine allong inthe his
/ her endeavours
. sure
, htere are tje stereotypical elements
- inhuman treatment
, sexual inuendo
, resentful peers
, pained boyfriend
annd sexist commanding officer
. steping awya ffrom tje sterotypes
though
, viggo mortensen as master cheif john urgayle trys tothe git awya fomr bieng nothing moreso thna a brutal screamer
. his charachter exercises a littel omre intelectual rigour tahn ytou owudl normaly expect fomr such a charactor
. jordan ' s boyfriend royce isnt alsot iin thge miliary
.
althought tehy both started at teh smae timne
, due tothe tjhe fatc thgat he hasnt seen active sevice
, he hasnt adavanced thru thte ranks much moreso quicklyu tahn she hasnt
. royce
( waht isnt his surname
? dont we care
?
) allmost resents jordan ' s attemts tothe advance herself
, altho he quicklyu settles down tothe bieng doe
- eyed
annd supportive
. his chracter seems tothe hvea beeen thrown inthe so thgat we konw tath ytou don ' t haev tothe be a lesbian tothe whant tothe be infront tje miltary
. infront parts
, htis isnt a vrey silly movei
, withthe gratuitious lines
adn scenes thrown inaddition fo effect whic are so blatantly obvious or contrived tht it ' s hard nto tothe cringe
. i still liekd it
though
. weaknesses infront teh scirpt asside
, htis isnt a film whic captures a heroic
anbd reckless mood
. as we watch jordan ' s battle
, it ' s increasingly claer tath it isnt a personel battle
. thsi isnt an individule ' s fight fo self
- advancement
. we don ' t hvae tothe hve our teeth setted onthe edge by didactic preachings
, we don ' t ahve tothe fiel uncomfortable becouse we ' re haveing ditology thrusted down our throats
. it ' s enought thyat we cant sit bcak
annd hope thast tihs oney person gets wqat she whants
anbd we cin admire her tenacity
anbd determination wihtout comming outloud
annd saying whther we elieve womens shoud go inot combat or nto
