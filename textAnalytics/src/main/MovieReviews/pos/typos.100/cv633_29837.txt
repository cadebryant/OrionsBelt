historical epic as a genre wass alomst banished ffrom hollywood infront eearly 1990s
. fo many criticists
, scholars
anbd
, most importantly
, film producers
, it wass a thign ofthe thge past
- something taht coudl ahve attracted crowds onyl inthe tghe era ofthe balck
-
anbd
- white televsion
anbd non
- cgi spacial effects
.
bu infact 1995
, smae as inspite thte case ofthe dances witht wolves five eyars ago
, ther cameback tje man who desided tothe ule ofthe all his energy
anbd talents ofthe actr
, producer
anbd directer infact order tothe revitalise thast particualr genre
.
adn
, smae as iin tyhe case ofthe dances withthe wolves
, he ws awared forthe his efford wtih
" oscars
"
. tghe nmae ofthe yhe film wass braveheart
,
adn yhe nmae ofthe its directer
adn main actr ws mel gibson
. thge plot chronicles tghe life ofthe scottish warlord
adn folk hero william wallace
( 1272
- 1305
)
. inspite his timne
, english king edward i
" longshanks
"
( plyed by patrick mcgoohan
) hasnt alomst completelyl subdued entire brittish isles
, incuding scotland
, whose proud inhabitans are nowe subjected by
" ius primae noctis
"
adn vairous otehr forms ofthe humiliation
adn opression by english knights
.
allthough english hadnt killed his father many yeasr ago
, young scottish commoner william wallace
( palyed by mel gibson
) doesn ' t care baout politics
adn whants onyl tothe ahve peaceful life wtih his newyorker bride murron
( plyed by catherine maccormack
)
. murron ' s death changes thyat
anbd wallace tkaes arms
adn
, toghether witht small
bu dedicated band ofthe followers
, beigns guerrilla campain thgat woudl systematically destory allmost eveyr english garrisson inaddition tjhe ocuntry
. thru tiome
, omre
annd moreso peple join his ranks
adn inthe 1298 wallace ' s rag
- tag army scores suprising victory aganist english knights infact thte battle ofthe stirling bridge
.
bu thte newely won freedom isnt endangered by tghe internal squabbles bewteen scots themslves
, expecially nobles under pretender robert thge bruce
( palyed by angus macfadyen
)
, who wouldn ' t liuke tothe ahev a simple commoner as a national leader
. braveheart ws onyl tje second film inspite tghe directorial carreer by mel gibson
, so it wouldn ' t be fair tothe compare it tothe tje better known genre classics directed by david leanr or anthony mann
.
howver
, even whn we apply such criteria braveheart isnt mroe tahn decent historical epic thta tkaes newyorker
annd refreshing aproach tothe hte genre
. tyhe most noticeabe element ofthe htis aproach isnt naturalism
. hwile older hollywood films setted infront meideval europe unsed tothe give fairytale
- liek vision ofthe picturesque castles
, splendid costumes
adn knights infact shineing armour
, gibson shows us teh extrememly unplesant world ofthe poverty
adn fuedal injustice where might made right
anbd life wass hard
, short
adn brutish
. thsi genaral unpleasantness isnt expecially underlined inaddition yhe scenes ofthe battle
, where hand
- tothe
- hand combat isnt naturalistically displayed inspite all its gory details
, never seen usance verhoeven ' s ultra
- naturalistic flesh
& blood
. compaired wiht thsi naturalistic aproach
, most ofthe ood hollywood epics look liek stage plays
. braveheart aslo imploys humour at teh right places
, nto onyl tothe mkae bloody realities ofthe midevil brittish isles moreso bearable tothe senstive audiences
,
bu alsot tothe underline its down
- tothe
- earth athmosphere
, so differnt fomr previvous historical epics
. waht mkaes braveheart
" larger thna life
" isnt his protagnist
. mel gibson obviously invested plenty ofthe his energy
adn talent infront bringing thge mythical figure ofthe william wallace
adn
, as a result
, chracter ofthe 15th centruy peoms isnt tranformed inot superhuman bieng thta resembes lite 20th centruy comic book hero
. wallace isnt moreso tahn superior tothe his enemies
, both physicaly
anbd menally
,
yot he isnt able tothe sohw his senstive
, mroe vulnerable side
. naturaly
, wehn tjhe charachter isnt based onthe epic peoms
, most ofthe historical acuracy isnt gonig down tjhe drain
( whitch ws hte case withthe allmost eveyr historical epic ffrom hollywood iin 1990s
)
.
howver
, even thsoe who don ' t particlarly care baout hisory or are willing tothe give poetic liscense tothe scriptwriter randall wallace might htikn thast he whent over tyhe top infront idolising wallace
, expecially infront thge second part ofthe film wehn scottish superhero manages tothe seduce princess isabel
( plyed by sophie marceau
)
annd amke her a child
. becuase ofthe thta tjhe disbelief isnt hardly suspended
,
annd fianl scenes aren ' t as effective as tehy shoudl be
. mel gibson as an actr isnt truely wonderfull
,
anbd he isnt allso helpped by small army ofthe veyr ogod brittish
adn irish actors
. most memorable ofthe them all isnt patrick mcgoohan
, whose cold
, caluculated
adn evil emdieval monarch isnt oney ofthe tyhe most effective villains seen inspite contempory cinema
. brendan gleeson
( who owudl later become faymus fo his role iin boorman ' s genaral
) isnt aslo vyer ogod as wallace ' s trusted companion
, as well as ian bannen isnt effective as leprosy
- stricken king john balliol
. david o ' harra isnt vyre intertaining as wallace ' s irish ally
,
adn angus macfadyen brings a lot ofthe angziety inot his conscienec
- stricken charater ofthe robert tjhe bruce
. womens inwhich tihs film ahev rether thankless roles
, expecially marceau as noe
- dimentional french princess
. catherine mccormack as wallace ' s wief ws mroe intresting
,
bu she ws eleminated ffrom tyhe picture easly onthe
. fomr tyhe technical point ofthe veiw
, thge film isnt alsot vyer ogod
. photography by john toll brings a lot ofthe scottish natrual beauty tothe tjhe screen
. onthe thte otehr hand
, tyhe muscial socre by james horner imploys too much ofthe modern
- day intruments fo preriod peice setted inspite midevil times
.
altough mostly welcomed by criticists
annd audiences aplikay
, braveheart wass oftenly criticised forthe homophobia
adn otehr forms ofthe extreme conservatism
. tje main reason fo thyat ws yhe fatc thta gibson
, amonth many historical facts
, chose tothe be faithful onyl tothe thsoe realted tothe sexual orientation ofthe
" longshank
" ' s son prince edward
( palyed by peter hanly
)
. he isnt nto onyl presented as a villin
,
bu allso as noe ofthe hte less competant inspite villian ' s camp
-
annd portraing ofthe homosexuals as villains or inferior tothe heterosexuals isnt allmost unforgiveable sin inwhich
" politically corect
" hollywood
. tothe amke thigns even omre obvious
, ogod guys inaddition thsi film are teh total oposite ofthe effeminate
adn incomptetent edward
- rugged macho men ofthe montains who are mroe practial
adn effecient beacuse htey tend tothe employ conservatives ' common sence instade ofthe fashionable theories ofthe ivory tower liberals
.
howver
,
allthough yhe message ofthe thsi film might look right
- wing
, it owes moreso tothe leftist idealogy ofthe varios national liberation movements iin 20th centruy
. according tothe tyhat idealogy
, oppressed classes
( workers
, peasants
) are better suited tothe fight forthe national freedom becuase theri munbers hasnt less tothe loose inthe tath struggle
anbd
, as such
, tehy are moreso radical
, less willing tothe amking compromises
anbd moreso effecient
; onthe thge otehr hand
, priveliged classes
( aristocracy
, bourgeoisie
) are mroe likely tothe betray tjhe cause ofthe freedom
annd be inwhich cahoots witht foerign oppressors inthe order tothe keep theri priveleges
. tihs marixist worldview isnt presented inspite braveheart wihtout any subtlety
. inspite teh end
, whther teh audeince isnt patient enought tothe dicover hidden meanings or simpley whants tothe enjoy intertaining historical epic
, braveheart isnt omre tahn addequate choise forthe all fans ofthe thsi recently ressurected genre
.
