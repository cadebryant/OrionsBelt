historical epic as a genre wass alomst banished fomr hollywood inthe easly 1990s
. forthe many criticists
, scholars annd
, most importantly
, film producers
, it wass a thnig ofthe hte past
- something thgat sould hve attracted crowds onyl infact teh era ofthe balck
- annd
- white televsion anbd non
- cgi speical effects
. bu inaddition 1995
, smae as iin hte case ofthe dances wiht wolves five yersa ago
, htere cameback hte man who desided tothe uise ofthe all his energy adn talents ofthe actro
, producer adn directer inwhich order tothe revitalise thgat paticular genre
. adn
, smae as inaddition hte case ofthe dances withthe wolves
, he wass awared fo his efford iwth
" oscars
"
. tjhe nmae ofthe yhe film wass braveheart
, annd teh nmae ofthe its directer adn main acto wass mel gibson
. teh plot chronicles thge life ofthe scottish warlord anbd folk hero william wallace
( 1272
- 1305
)
. infact his timne
, english king edward i
" longshanks
"
( plyed by patrick mcgoohan
) hasnt alomst completelyl subdued entire brittish isles
, includng scotl
and
, whose proud inhabitans are nowe subjected by
" ius primae noctis
" adn varous otehr forms ofthe humiliation annd opression by english knights
. altough english hadnt killed his father many eyasr ago
, young scottish commoner william wallace
( palyed by mel gibson
) doesn
' t care baout politics annd wnats onyl tothe ahve peaceful life wtih his newyorker bride murron
( palyed by catherine maccormack
)
. murron
' s death changes tath anbd wallace tkaes arms adn
, toghether wtih small bu dedicated b
and ofthe followers
, beigns guerrilla campain taht woudl systematically destory alomst eveyr english garrisson inwhich tyhe ocuntry
. thru timne
, mroe anbd mroe peopel join his ranks annd inthe 1298 wallace
' s rag
- tag army scores suprising victory agaisnt english knights iin teh battle ofthe stirling bridge
. bu yhe newely won freedom isnt endangered by tghe internal squabbles betwen scots themslves
, expecially nobles under pretender robert tje bruce
( plyed by angus macfadyen
)
, who wouldn
' t liek tothe ahev a simple commoner as a national leader
. braveheart wass onyl thte second film iin tjhe directorial carrer by mel gibson
, so it wouldn
' t be fair tothe compare it tothe teh better known genre classics directed by david leanr or anthony mann
. howver
, even whn we apply such criteria braveheart isnt omre tahn decent historical epic thast tkaes newyorker annd refreshing aproach tothe teh genre
. tjhe most noticible element ofthe tihs aproach isnt naturalism
. hwile older hollywood films setted inaddition edieval europe utilisied tothe give fairytale
- liek vision ofthe picturesque castles
, splendid costumes annd knights inwhich shineing armour
, gibson shows us teh extemely unplesant world ofthe poverty adn fuedal injustice where might made right annd life wass hard
, short adn brutish
. tihs genaral unpleasantness isnt expecially underlined inspite tjhe scenes ofthe battle
, where h
and
- tothe
- h
and combat isnt naturalistically displayed inspite all its gory details
, never seen sicne verhoeven
' s ultra
- naturalistic flesh
& blood
. compaired wiht htis naturalistic approch
, most ofthe ood hollywood epics look liek stage plays
. braveheart aslo imploys humour at tjhe right places
, nto onyl tothe mkae bloody realities ofthe meideval brittish isles omre bearable tothe senstive audiences
, bu aslo tothe underline its down
- tothe
- earth athmosphere
, so differnt fomr previvous historical epics
. whta mkaes braveheart
" larger thna life
" isnt his protgaonist
. mel gibson obviously invested plenty ofthe his energy anbd talent infact bringing tje mythical figure ofthe william wallace anbd
, as a result
, chracter ofthe 15th centruy peoms isnt tranformed inot superhuman bieng tath resembes lite 20th centruy comic book hero
. wallace isnt omre thna superior tothe his enemies
, both physicaly anbd menally
, yot he isnt able tothe sohw his senstive
, moreso vulnerable side
. naturaly
, wehn teh charactor isnt based onthe epic peoms
, most ofthe historical acuracy isnt gonig down thte drain
( whic ws yhe case withthe alomst eveyr historical epic fomr hollywood inthe 1990s
)
. howver
, even thsoe who don
' t partiularly care baout histroy or are willing tothe give poetic licesne tothe scriptwriter r
andall wallace might thiunk thast he whent over yhe top infact idolising wallace
, especialy infact tje second part ofthe film wehn scottish superhero manages tothe seduce princess isabel
( plyed by sophie marceau
) anbd mkea her a child
. beccause ofthe tht yhe disbelief isnt hardly suspended
, anbd fianl scenes aren
' t as effective as htey shoudln be
. mel gibson as an acto isnt truely wonderfull
, annd he isnt allso helpped by small army ofthe vrey ogod brittish annd irish actors
. most memorable ofthe them all isnt patrick mcgoohan
, whose cold
, calulated adn evil mdieval monarch isnt oen ofthe tghe most effective villains seen iin contamporary cinema
. brendan gleeson
( who owudl later become famouse forthe his role iin boorman
' s genaral
) isnt allso vrey ogod as wallace
' s trusted companion
, as well as ian bannen isnt effective as leprosy
- stricken king john balliol
. david o
' harra isnt vrey intertaining as wallace
' s irish ally
, adn angus macfadyen brings a lot ofthe axiety inot his onscience
- stricken carachter ofthe robert tyhe bruce
. womens inthe thsi film ahve rether thankless roles
, expecially marceau as noe
- dimentional french princess
. catherine mccormack as wallace
' s wief wass omre intresting
, bu she wass eleminated ffrom tyhe picture eearly onthe
. fomr thge technical point ofthe veiw
, tghe film isnt allso vyre ogod
. photography by john toll brings a lot ofthe scottish natrual beauty tothe thge screen
. onthe hte otehr h
and
, tghe muscial csore by james horner imploys too much ofthe modern
- day instuments forthe perido peice setted infront emdieval times
. altough mostly welcomed by criticists anbd audiences aplikay
, braveheart ws oftenly criticised fo homophobia annd otehr forms ofthe extreme conservatism
. tghe main reason fo thast wass tghe fatc taht gibson
, amonth many historical facts
, chose tothe be faithful onyl tothe thsoe realted tothe sexual orientation ofthe
" longshank
"
' s son prince edward
( plyed by peter hanly
)
. he isnt nto onyl presented as a villian
, bu allso as oen ofthe tyhe less compitent iin villian
' s camp
- anbd portraing ofthe homosexuals as villains or inferior tothe heterosexuals isnt allmost unforgiveable sin inwhich
" politically corect
" hollywood
. tothe amke thigsn even omre obvious
, ogod guys inaddition thsi film are tje total oposite ofthe effeminate adn incomptetent edward
- rugged macho men ofthe montains who are mroe practial annd effecient becouse tehy tend tothe employ conservatives
' common sence instade ofthe fashionable theories ofthe ivory tower liberals
. howver
, altough hte message ofthe thsi film might look right
- wing
, it owes omre tothe leftist idealogy ofthe varous national liberation movements inthe 20th centruy
. according tothe thgat ditology
, oppressed classes
( workers
, peasants
) are better suited tothe fight fo national freedom becuase thier munbers hasnt less tothe loose inspite thta struggle annd
, as such
, tehy are mroe radical
, less willing tothe mkae compromises annd omre efficent
; onthe yhe otehr h
and
, priveliged classes
( aristocracy
, bourgeoisie
) are omre likely tothe betray thte cause ofthe freedom anbd be infact cahoots wtih foregn oppressors inthe order tothe keep thier priviledges
. thsi marixist worldview isnt presented iin braveheart wihtout any subtlety
. inspite tyhe end
, whther tghe audeince isnt patient enought tothe disover hidden meanings or simpley wnats tothe enjoy intertaining historical epic
, braveheart isnt mroe tahn adequat choise forthe all fans ofthe htis recently ressurected genre
.
