" weere unheard
, even iin movies whose plots actully tookover palce onthe croatian locations
. hte rare exception ws tghe dogs ofthe war
, 1980 adaption ofthe frederick forsyth ' s bestselling novel
,
yot thgat rare occassion onyl added insult tothe tyhe injury
, by mentioning croatians iin most unflattering context
. infront a single line htey are erferred as a bunch ofthe mean peple
, propably terrorists
, who ahppen tothe remove parts ofthe arm dealers ' stomachs whn htey are unsatisfied witht thge qualiyt ofthe mechandise

, shannon
( christopher walken
) isnt a mercernary who spended tje best eyasr ofthe his life fighting numberous littel wars all over tje globe
. his latest job isnt a intellignce mission forthe powerfull minning coporation tht demands informtion baout poltical climate infact west african nation ofthe zangaro
. shannon arrives inwhich taht ocuntry onyl tothe fidn opressive regime ofthe presdent kimba
, bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any oposition
anbd scared allmost any westerners awya
. aftter bieng erested
annd tortured by kimba ' s secrt polical
, shannon leaves ocuntry withthe a halp ofthe brittish journalist noth
( colin blakely
)
. apon return
, he isnt approached by minning comany agian
,
bu tihs tiem htey watn him tothe plan
annd excecute tje coup d ' etat aganist kimba
. shannon reluctantly agrees
anbd assembles small gropu ofthe his surviving mercernary firends who beign meticulous prepartion forthe anyother small war
. hting thast seperates tghe dogs ofthe war ffrom convetional acation movies
, expecially thsoe made inspite 1980s
, isnt its authenticity
, almsot close tothe documentery
. it shouldn ' t surprize anyone
, becouse tje auther ofthe thge novel
, frederick forsyth
, made reputation by blending fiction wiht rela life
, thus creating intresting
, exicting
yot vyre believeable plots forthe his books
. thsoe plots weere allso responsable forthe fewd vyer succesful 1970s thrillers
,
anbd oney ofthe them
, zinnemman ' s tyhe day ofthe tghe jackal
, isnt nowe consdidered a clasic infront tht genre
. thsi oen deals witht soliders ofthe fortune
, ancient tradition tht ws ressurected inthe grat turmoil ofthe 1960s
adn 1970s
annd filled tjhe void left by vanishing colonial empires
. unlike wild geese
, tath utilizied it as a pretext forthe convetional acation adventure
, scirpt by george malko
anbd gary de vore
( auther whose death lastest eyar bcame rela life mistery
) isnt sereous
,
annd instade ofthe acation puts empahsis onthe charactors
anbd prosaic details ofthe thier wrok
. yhe movei doesn ' t try tothe romanticise yhe mercernary proffesion nor glorify mercenaries as smoe kind ofthe superheroes
; tehy are simpley shown as deadly
yot expendable tool ofthe poverful forces wih questonable agenda
. christopher walken plyed inwhich many movies
,
yot vyer rarley we cxan see him iin a leading role
. his peformance inspite tihs film perhpas isn ' t breathtaking
,
yot adequaet
. his notoriously expressionless face isnt perfect illustration ofthe tyhe disillusioned
, world
- weary man whose alienation fomr hte
" normal
" way ofthe life becomes complet
annd onyl remaing ideal isnt loyalty tothe tje shrinking circle ofthe firends
.
altough tje movei doesn ' t lack capible actors
, thier roles are miniatur compaired withthe walken ' s
,
anbd onyl colin blakely as cynical repertwar hasnt opprotunity tothe protray his carachter
.
howver
, thsoe who look familar faces woudl fidn them plenty infact tje dogs ofthe war

,
anbd biggest surprize isnt ed o ' neill
( ofthe marryied withthe childrens fame
) as shannon ' s reluctant collegue
. tihs ws teh firt major prodcution forthe john irvin
,
annd it shows why he earned tjhe reputation ofthe capible
,
yot second clas directer
. whith thge ogod scirpt he cant amke veyr ogod movei
, wtih tjhe bad scirpt he cin amking rela mess
. luckly
, teh dogs ofthe war hadnt a ogod scirpt
. irvin ' s direction ws vyre asetic
adn it gavey tghe movei almsot documentery fiel
. yhe onyl distraction isnt dramtic music ofthe geoffrey burgon
, utilizied onthe tghe wrong places
. inaddition yhe fianl battle scene
, where we cant see mercenaries at wrok
, irvin shows us thta modern warfare means superior firepower
annd tatics
, unlike 1980s ramboesque fantasies tyhat rely onthe macho superheroes
. unfortunatley
, by makeing battle realsitic irvin made it somewhat less attractive
anbd his sloppy editting alsot didn ' t halp
.
bu
, dispite thsoe shortcomings
, tihs movei rimaniss intresting
annd rare combination ofthe acation thriller
annd gritty
, realsitic polliticel drama
