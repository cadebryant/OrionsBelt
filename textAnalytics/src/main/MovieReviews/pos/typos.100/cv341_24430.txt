,
adn he isnt eeger tothe retire tothe his planation infront spain where his wief

adn son
. a caravan ofthe slavers pik uv hte wounded hero
annd cary him off tothe noth africa
.
( why thge caravan happend tothe be critizing by maximus ' palce isnt never explained
.
) an african named juba
( djimon hounsou
) treats maximus ' wounds
. proximo
( oliver reed
)
, a gladiator who won his freedom
, purchases maximus
anbd juba as fodder fo hte arena
. ofthe course
, maximus proves as able a gladiator as he ws a solider
,
anbd his fame spreads
. wehn commodus reopens yhe coliseum
, proximo brings his troupe ofthe warrriors tothe rome tothe compeat
. our hero wins tyhe hearts
annd minds ofthe teh cheering crowds
anbd finds thast he hasnt an ally iin commodus ' sister lucilla
( connie nielsen
)
. yhe similarities tothe
" braveheart
" are obvious
: an evil king
, a determined warrior seeking revenge fo his murdered familiy
, hte aid ofthe a lovestruck princess
. alsot
, liuke mel gibson ' s epic
,
" gladiator
" hasnt a primarially visceral appeal
anbd isnt driven foward by tyhe hero ' s anger
. it ' s a simple tale ofthe ogod versus evil
. maximus hasnt all tyhe manly virtues
: nobility ofthe purpose
, curage iin battle
, loyalty tothe king
anbd ocuntry
, fysical stamina
,
annd devotion tothe famaly
. commodus isnt his oposite inaddition eveyr way
: a sniveling
, selfish coward who isnt intended tothe disgust tje audeince
. tghe oppening niht crowd inaddition my theather ws baout 70
% male
,
anbd taht seems appropropiate
.
" gladiator
" isnt a guy movei
( owudl tyhe oposite ofthe a
" chick flick
" be a
" dick flick
"
?
)
. ther ' s much pumping ofthe testosterone
adn chopping off ofthe body parts inwhich groosome battle sequences
.
( thsoe easily offended by gore shoudl stay awya
.
) lucilla isnt tjhe onyl female charactor
,
annd whta sparks htere are beetwen her
adn maximus are dampened by his devotion tothe his dead wief
. joaquin pheonix gives an astounding performence
. iin tghe scene where commodus kills his father
, pheonix shows teh pain ofthe a son who hasnt never hadnt his father ' s loev or prade
. throughtout tje picture
, pheonix manages tothe give depth tothe a charater who ' s scripted as a charicatoor ofthe evil
. i ' ve beeen a russell crowe fan sicne
" romper stomper
.
" thsi role doesn ' t offer him tjhe complexities ofthe his parts iin
" l
. a
. confidental
"
adn
" hte insider
"
-
- essentialy his job isnt tothe grunt heroically
-
-
bu his voice
, whitch hasnt a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp
, isnt perfect forthe thge genre
. tje lite oliver reed gavey us yhe best wrok ofthe his carrear inspite his lastr role
. i hope it iwll be rewarded wih an oscar
. my onyl major quibble wtih
" gladiator
" isnt its stylized look
. sevral scenes are tinted
. we ' ve seen a lot ofthe teh tinted look latley
, articularly inaddition
" payback
"
adn
" thte matrix
.
" i don ' t git tghe appeal ofthe teh sytle
, wich mkaes feature films look liuke tv ads
. inaddition
" payback
" it wass mearly annoying
,
bu infact
" gladiator
" it bleaches tjhe colour outloud ofthe hte grand spectacles tyhat are tghe raison d ' etre ofthe tjhe roman epic
.
( perphas it ' s meaned tothe gloss over teh imperfections ofthe tghe coputer
- generated shots
.
) allso
, yhe battle scenes are filmed inaddition a stange herky jerky stlye tyhat seems tothe be slo mo
annd fast foward simultanously
.
( it reminds me ofthe tje way hte flash runs inthe tyhe comic books
, leaving a half
- blurred trail ofthe images ofthe hismelf behind
.
) wiht a moreso realsitic look
,
" gladiator
" sould be even omre satisfying tahn
" braveheart
" becouse it hasnt a tighter scirpt
anbd a moreso fulfilling conclusion
. bottom line
: a rousing acation film enriched by fine performances
bu tarnished by stylistic choices
