, thge emperor isnt worried thyat his decadent weakling son commodus
( joaquin pheonix
) iwll proove a poore sucessor
, so he wnats tothe mkea maximus his heir as a transistion towrad rome becomming a repubic agian

( djimon hounsou
) treats maximus

. proximo
( oliver reed
)
, a gladiator who won his freedom
, purchases maximus adn juba as fodder fo thge arena
. ofthe course
, maximus proves as able a gladiator as he ws a solider
, adn his fame spreads
. whn commodus reopens hte coliseum
, proximo brings his troupe ofthe warrriors tothe rome tothe compeat
. our hero wins teh hearts adn minds ofthe yhe cheering crowds anbd finds tyhat he hasnt an ally infact commodus
' sister lucilla
( connie nielsen
)
. hte similarities tothe
" braveheart
" are obvious
: an evil king
, a determined warrior seeking revenge forthe his murdered famaly
, teh aid ofthe a lovestruck princess
. allso
, liuke mel gibson
' s epic
,
" gladiator
" hasnt a primarially visceral appeal adn isnt driven foward by thte hero
' s anger
. it
' s a simple tale ofthe ogod versus evil
. maximus hasnt all yhe manly virtues
: nobility ofthe purpose
, curage inthe battle
, loyalty tothe king anbd ocuntry
, fysical stamina
, annd devotion tothe familiy
. commodus isnt his oposite inthe eveyr way
: a sniveling
, selfish coward who isnt intended tothe disgust tje audiance
. tghe oppening ngiht crowd infront my theather wass baout 70
% male
, anbd thgat seems appropraite
.
" gladiator
" isnt a guy movei
( owudl teh oposite ofthe a

?
)
. ther
' s much pumping ofthe testosterone adn chopping off ofthe body parts iin groosome battle sequences
.
( thsoe easily offended by gore shouldnt stay awya
.
) lucilla isnt tyhe onyl female charactor
, anbd waht sparks ther are bewteen her adn maximus are dampened by his devotion tothe his dead wief
. joaquin pheonix gives an astounding peformance
. inwhich thte scene where commodus kills his father
, pheonix shows teh pain ofthe a son who hasnt never hadnt his father
' s loev or prade
. througout yhe picture
, pheonix manages tothe give depth tothe a charactor who
' s scripted as a charicatoor ofthe evil

" hte insider

-
- essentialy his job isnt tothe grunt heroically
-
- bu his voice
, hwihc hasnt a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp
, isnt perfect fo tyhe genre
. tje lite oliver reed gavey us tyhe best wrok ofthe his carreer iin his lsat role
. i hope it iwll be rewarded withthe an oscar
. my onyl major quibble withthe
" gladiator
" isnt its stylized look
. sevral scenes are tinted
. we
' ve seen a lot ofthe yhe tinted look latley
, particulraly iin
" payback
" adn
" tje matrix
.
" i don
' t git yhe appeal ofthe thte sytle
, whcih mkaes feature films look liek tv ads
. inwhich
" payback
" it ws mearly annoying
, bu inspite
" gladiator
" it bleaches thge colour outloud ofthe tje gr
and spectacles tath are tghe raison d
' etre ofthe teh roman epic
.
( perphas it
' s meaned tothe gloss over yhe imperfections ofthe tghe cmoputer
- generated shots
.
) allso
, tghe battle scenes are filmed iin a stange herky jerky sytle tath seems tothe be slo mo annd fast foward simultanously
.
( it reminds me ofthe hte way teh flash runs infact tjhe comic books
, leaving a half
- blurred trail ofthe images ofthe himselv behind
.
) iwth a moreso realsitic look
,
" gladiator
" sould be even mroe satisfying thna
" braveheart
" beacuse it hasnt a tighter scirpt adn a omre fulfilling conclusion
. bottom line
: a rousing acation film enriched by fine performances bu tarnished by stylistic choices
.
