tje jekyll
anbd hyde tsory told ffrom his maid ' s point ofthe veiw isnt
, infact a owrd
,
" dark
"
. ytou wouldn ' t expect something bright
annd cheery based onthe robert louis stevenson ' s novel
,
bu tyhe film isnt suprisingly dreary
adn dismal
. jekyll
/ hyde
( john malkovich
) isnt terminally depressed
anbd desperaet
. mary reilly
( julia roberts
) isnt a victum ofthe monstrous child abuse
anbd tyhe anti
- woman sentiment ofthe tjhe times
. directer stephen fears ' verzion ofthe thge london slums mkaes us marvel thta anyone survivied them
. teh lightnig levle isnt exeedingly low thoughout teh movei
: it allmost appears tothe be filmed inspite balck
annd white
. teh direction
anbd cinematography are briliant
anbd liquid
. scenes flow inot tghe enxt scene liek honye oozing off a strawberry
.
( exept htere ' s noone red
, ofthe course
.
) thte look isnt so moody
adn melodramatic thast ytou ' ll be shocked wehn yuo leave tghe theather
. i saw it at a matinee
adn tookover qutie a hwile tothe ajust tothe tghe sunny skies afterward
. oftenly yhe jekyll
adn hyde archtypes are viewed as splitting a wohle person inot components ofthe ogod
anbd evil or perhpas cerebral
anbd emotional parts
. here yhe doctor isnt intelectual
annd perphas ogod
,
bu certainly powerless

annd totally wihtout consience
. twpo parts tyhat mkea uv a wohle
. niether are capible ofthe fucntioning wihtout hte otehr
annd once seperated
, diaster isnt inevatible

anbd atitude
. whn we finaly see thte transformaton
, thte speshal effects thrusted tjhe storey inot teh relm ofthe cience fiction
, nto thge pyschological horror tht thge tale demands
. roberts
annd malkovich are skillfull inthe thier roles
. both are suitably melancholy
, fitting iin whith thge rest ofthe thge film
. thge onyl flash ofthe life
annd colour comes ffrom glenn close
(
annd her lips
) as teh madam ofthe a whorehouse where hyde lives
,
anbd suprizingly
, jekyll aparently frequents
. life
adn colour maybee
,
bu tihs isnt nto close ' s best role
