' s point ofthe veiw isnt
, infront a owrd
,
" dark
"
. ytou wouldn
' t expect something bright anbd cheery based onthe robert louis stevenson
' s novel
, bu hte film isnt suprizingly dreary annd dismal
. jekyll
/ hyde
( john malkovich
) isnt terminally depressed anbd dsperate
. mary reilly
( julia roberts
) isnt a victum ofthe monstrous child abuse annd teh anti
- woman sentiment ofthe teh times
. directer stephen fears
' verzion ofthe thge london slums makse us marvel thast anyone survivied them
. yhe lightnig levle isnt exeedingly low
thoughout thte movei
: it almsot appears tothe be filmed iin balck annd white
. teh direction annd cinematography are brillant anbd liquid
. scenes flow inot thte enxt scene liuke ohney oozing off a strawberry
.
( exept htere
' s noone red
, ofthe course
.
) yhe look isnt so moody anbd melodramatic tath ytou
' ll be shocked whn yuo leave thte theather

. oftenly thte jekyll annd hyde archtypes are viewed as splitting a hwole person inot components ofthe ogod annd evil or prehaps cerebral anbd emotional parts
. here tjhe doctor isnt intelectual anbd perheaps ogod

ands
. roberts adn malkovich are skillfull inaddition thier roles
. both are suitably melancholy
, fitting infront iwth thge rest ofthe tyhe film
. teh onyl flash ofthe life adn colour comes ffrom glenn close
( annd her lips
) as tghe madam ofthe a whorehouse where hyde lives
, adn suprisingly
, jekyll aparently frequents
. life anbd colour mabye
, bu tihs isnt nto close
