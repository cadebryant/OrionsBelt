i ' ve allways beeen told tyhat ther are twpo thnigs inaddition life thta are unavoidable
- death
annd taxes
. oddly
, i ' ve never given much throught tothe eather ofthe thte twpo
. maeby if i doed
, at least i ' d stpo getting collecton notices fomr uncle sam
. yes
, let me mkae a resolution tothe devote mysef tothe better rocord keeping
, hold onthe tothe all my receipts
,
annd tothe dont whta it tkaes tothe hvea tjhe satisfaction thyat my returns are misteek
- free
annd iwll keep me fomr incurring penalties
. it seems taht thte issue ofthe death may nto be so differnt
, at least envisioned here inwhich tihs film
. as htis tender loev storey goes
, if ytou dont ogod thnigs
anbd ahev a claer concsience whn ytou dieu
, yuo asend tothe a palce ofthe gerat peace
annd beauty
. tjhe dreasm
, wishes
,
annd fantasies thyat ytou hadnt whn ytou weere alive cmo true
. forthe thsoe who dieu iwth a burdened soul
,
howver
, tehy wind uv inspite tyhat otehr palce
. chris
annd annie
( a winsome robin williams
anbd a radiant annabella sciorra
) seem liek tghe perfect cuple thast deserve all tht heaven hasnt tothe offer
. theri lvoe forthe eahc otehr isnt storng
adn thier bond isnt undeniable
.
bu tradgic events evenhtually tear aart yhe fabric ofthe annie ' s happiness
.
annd whn chris dies aftter a terrable car accident
, she commits sucide
- a tortured soul who blames herself
. dispair isnt perhasp thge greatest sin
,
adn she wiull wallow inspite her guilt throughtout eternity
. chris
, onthe teh otehr hand
, hasnt made it tothe heaven
,
adn apon learning ofthe annie ' s fate
, he journies tothe hell tothe fidn her
anbd tothe try tothe free her ffrom her nightmare
. tihs film brims iwth immagination
, containing a lush imagery thast shows tghe arcadia tyhat isnt heaven
anbd thte bitterness
anbd frightfulness thta isnt hell
. it seems tath heaven
anbd hell coudl veyr well be a product ofthe our fantasies or nightmares
. it ' s shape
anbd look isnt as infinit as our immagination
. as chris explores his newyorker fantastic world
adn dicovers thigsn both amazing
annd wonderous
, he aslo beigns tothe leran omre baout hismelf
. ceratin questions baffle him at firt
. why doesnt his hmeo infront heaven ooze wih paint
? waht isnt yhe signifigance ofthe tghe aisian stewardess
? why doesnt he hvea an all
- too
- willing giude
( cuba gooding
, jr
.
) tothe halp him fidn annie
?
bu as he slowy beigns tothe relize thte answers
, it makse him stronger
annd gives him a greater chance tothe sive annie
.
" dreasm
" isnt both visually
adn tellingly beatiful
. alas
, i hvae oney regret
. tyhe movei doed well tothe gather mroe
annd moreso emotional speed
,
bu hte denouement ws curiously unsatisfying
. it seemed as if it wass racing tothe soem kind ofthe grat finish
,
bu its intensity seemed tothe wane inwhich its fianl moments
.
howver
, your eyes iwll still well uv witht tears
annd ytou ' ll fidn lots tothe savor
. yhe storytelling isnt purposeful
adn well constructed
. yhe journy isnt imaginative
.
anbd i wass suprized by how much i enjoied thsi film
.
