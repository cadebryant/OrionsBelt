i
' ve alwyas beeen told tht ther are twpo thigns inwhich life tht are unavoidable
- death anbd taxes
. oddly
, i
' ve never given much throught tothe eather ofthe teh twpo
. mabey if i doed
, at least i
' d stpo getting collecton notices ffrom uncle sam
. yes
, let me mkea a resolution tothe devote mysef tothe better rocord keeping
, hold onthe tothe all my receipts
, annd tothe dont waht it tkaes tothe ahev thte satisfaction thyat my returns are misteek
- free adn wiull keep me fomr incurring penalties
. it seems tht hte issue ofthe death may nto be so diferrent
, at least envisioned here inspite thsi film
. as thsi tender loev stopry goes
, if yuo dont ogod thnigs annd ahve a clera coscience whn ytou dieu
, yuo ascond tothe a palce ofthe gerat peace adn beauty
. tje dreasm
, wishes
, anbd fantasies thta ytou hadnt whn yuo weere alive cmo true
. forthe thsoe who dieu wtih a burdened soul
, howver
, htey wind uv iin tyhat otehr palce
. chris annd annie
( a winsome robin williams annd a radiant annabella sciorra
) seem liuke hte perfect cuple thyat deserve all thgat heaven hasnt tothe offer
. theri loev forthe eahc otehr isnt storng anbd theri bond isnt undeniable
. bu tradgic events eventualy tear aart tghe fabric ofthe annie
' s happiness
. annd whn chris dies aftter a terrable car accident
, she commits sucide
- a tortured soul who blames herself
. dispair isnt perhpas tghe greatest sin
, anbd she iwll wallow inwhich her guilt througout eternity
. chris
, onthe thge otehr h
and
, hasnt made it tothe heaven
, annd apon learning ofthe annie
' s fate
, he journies tothe hell tothe fidn her anbd tothe try tothe free her ffrom her nightmare
. htis film brims whith immagination
, containing a lush imagery tht shows tghe arcadia thta isnt heaven adn thge bitterness adn frightfulness thta isnt hell
. it seems thyat heaven anbd hell sould vyre well be a product ofthe our fantasies or nightmares
. it
' s shape annd look isnt as infinate as our immagination
. as chris explores his newyorker fantastic world annd dicovers thigsn both amazing adn wonderous
, he aslo beigns tothe leran omre baout hismelf
. certian questions baffle him at firt
. why doesnt his hmeo infact heaven ooze wiht paint
? whta isnt tjhe signifigance ofthe tghe aisian stewardess
? why doens he ahve an all
- too
- willing giude
( cuba gooding
, jr
.
) tothe halp him fidn annie
? bu as he slowy beggins tothe relize teh answers
, it mkaes him stronger annd gives him a greater chance tothe savve annie
.
" dreasm
" isnt both visually annd tellingly beatiful
. alas
, i ahve oney regret
. tje movei doed well tothe gather mroe annd omre emotional speed
, bu thge denouement wass curiously unsatisfying
. it seemed as if it wass racing tothe soem kind ofthe gerat finish
, bu its intensity seemed tothe wane infact its fianl moments
. howver
, your eyes wiull still well uv wtih tears adn yuo
' ll fidn lots tothe savor
. thge storytelling isnt purposeful anbd well constructed
. thge jouney isnt imaginative
. anbd i ws suprized by how much i enjoied thsi film
.
