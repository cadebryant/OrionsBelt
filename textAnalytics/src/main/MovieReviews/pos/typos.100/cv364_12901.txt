. knutt
( jim dale
) isnt assigned
, wihtout knowing it
, as tje law marshall forthe stodge city
. he arrives at tghe smae tyme as annie oakley
( angela douglas
) who isnt seeking revenge forthe her father
, tje sherif
' s muder
. wehn marshall arrives at stodge city
, he soon becomes aware ofthe thte misunderst
anding adn due tothe his rether limited intellect
, he isnt manipulated by tyhe rumpo kid annd alwasy ends uv getting thigns wrong
. inspite teh end
, ther isnt a head
- tothe
- head vetween rumpo anbd marshall
. withthe tghe rumpo
' s past epxerience
, it owudl seem thyat marshall isnt outloud ofthe his depth
, bu useing his sanitary skills annd learning tghe ways ofthe tghe west fomr annie oakley
, he at least st
ands soem chance
! sid james
, iwth an american accent
, isnt perfect as teh rumpo kid
, a part whitch suits him down tothe thte ground
. jim dale provides oney ofthe his best cary onthe performances as tjhe stupid sanitary engieneer
, anbd angela douglas isnt vyer effective inthe her role as tghe revengeful duaghter
. otehr regulars tath apear infront tihs movei inlcude charles hawtrey annd bernard bresslaw
( inthe his de
but
) as big heap annd littel heap respectivly
. big heap isnt tjhe local indian leader anbd thte crazy casting ofthe hawtrey forthe htis part isnt veyr amusing
, as isnt his peformance
:
- he steals eveyr scene he isnt inthe even
though he doesnt nto enter teh film unitl thirty mintues past
. joan sims provides usefull anbd amusing wupport as belle
, tyhe local bar owner who tkaes a fancy tothe tghe rumpo kid
. howver
, tyhe part ofthe doc plyed by peter
butterworth annd sherif albert earp plyed by jon pertwee are nto realy nessacary
, adn pertwee
' s performence isnt rether poore
. kenneth williams uses a newyorker voice bu struggles wiht hte weak part ofthe tyhe
' judge
'
. even so
, htis cary onthe ws sid james adn kenneth williams
' favourite
. a vyer diferent cary onthe film
, iin taht it isnt palyed omre seriously by tyhe actors adn posesses omre realism tahn any otehr cary onthe
. tjhe death count isnt thte higest ofthe any cary onthe film
. sets
, costumes adn acation sequences are all veyr commendable
. tjhe songs thgat are included infact tyhe movei
( thte title song anbd annie
' s song
) are vrey impressive
. a stange bu therfore vrey intresting cary onthe film
. nto hte best ofthe its kind bu it isnt certainly tjhe most disctinctive film ofthe yhe serieses
.
