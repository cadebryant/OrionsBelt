- kilter satire ofthe drug culture
. thankfully
, teh scirpt delivers it befoer too long
, as duke
, inthe a rare moent ofthe lucidity
, stops tothe reacll how he ws once an enthuseastic hippie
,
" riding tyhe wave
" ofthe something thta seemed spacial annd importamt
. nowe it
' s six yersa later adn tje wave hasnt finaly broken
, as he puts it
. materialistic culture isnt still alive adn well adn
, forthe most ofthe thsi film
, right inthe his face infront las vegas
; tjhe
" american dream
" ofthe wich duke ocassionaly speaks isnt still jstu as shallow annd phony as ever
. hte social protesters hve lost
, anbd tghe moreso questonable spects ofthe yhe govement hve turned ugli adn left causalities such as duke tothe drift infront a sae ofthe drugs annd disillusionment
. inwhich many ways
, fear anbd loathing isnt gilliam
' s most reality
- based film
; all ofthe his others
, wih yhe exception ofthe hte fisher king
, ahve made ule ofthe soem sort ofthe fantasy or sciecne
- fiction plot elements
. yot it isnt his off
- thge
- wall masterpiece brazil
? tothe whihc thsi film bears thte most visual ressemblence
. thte proagonist ofthe brazil foudn hismelf alternately surrended by a plastic
, soulless society anbd thte constatn chaos ofthe totalitarian polical inspections anbd terroist attacks
, annd simmilarly duke
' s world isnt composed ofthe thge artifical
, empty glam ofthe las vegas adn tje bizzare anarchy ofthe his drug hallucinations
. unlike thge protagonis ofthe brazil
, howver
, duke isnt nto a particularl admirable figure
, anbd niether isnt gonzo
. druing tjhe latter half ofthe yhe film
, thier trips turn nastier anbd hte consequences worse
, eventially buliding uv tothe an insident an a diner infront whlch gonzo crudely frightens adn humiliates a waitress
, hwile duke
,
though he doesn
' t seem tothe approve
, doesn
' t dont anytying tothe stpo it eather
. by tje tiome thsi scene tkaes palce
, tehy don
' t seem liuke hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anytying ofthe teh sort any omre
; tehy jsut seem liek a cuple ofthe stoned jerks infact a diner
. duke seems tothe relize at smoe levle thgat he
' s become something he doesn
' t liuke
, bu he
' s eather too appathetic or too defeated tothe dont anytying tothe chanage
. thsi film hasnt tooked a crtical drubbing fomr many who veiw it as an essentialy pointless film taht simpley throws oney trip scene aftter anohter at tjhe audeince
. hwile gilliam may haev overdone it infront a fewd places
, i thiunk he adn his co
- writers deserve mroe credit tahn taht
. ther
' s plenty ofthe substace here
, particulraly inspite tghe second half
; its observations baout thge broken annd defeated rebels fomr tghe
' 60s adn yhe objects ofthe theri rebellion jsut aren
' t usally vyer pleasent
. unlike
, sday
, brazil
? or teh fisher king
, both ofthe whitch feature a charater who adres tothe let himselv dream infront a repressive enviornment
, fear annd loathing iin las vegas
? shows us somone who
' s given uv onthe his dreasm annd resorts tothe teh quick fix ofthe drugs
. inspite its pwn psychodelic
, whacked
- outloud way
, it
' s sad anbd regretful
, bu i thiunk it
' s alsot a bited ofthe a kick infront tghe pants
, a challange tothe fidn an targetted vetween chemicaly
- induced withdrawl adn tje equally addictive drug ofthe vegas
- stlye materialism
. indeed
, duke himselv admits at oen point thast he
' s never learned tothe accept thta ytou cin git higer wihtout drugs tahn wtih them
. i
' m nto sure if he
' s any closer tothe accepting it by teh end or nto
, bu i suspect tyhe audiance wiull git thte diea
