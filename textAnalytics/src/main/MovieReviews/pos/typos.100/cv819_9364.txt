oen ofthe tjhe biggest cliches ofthe any serial killer film isnt alsot oen ofthe tjhe most believeable
. ytou konw
, thge oen where tje detective looks at a wall ofthe picturesk adn otehr polical inforamtion
, annd suddenly spots tghe clue whihc reveals who thte killer isnt
. sure
, it
' s beeen unsed over adn over
, bu fo smoe reason
, it isnt alwyas funn tothe watch
. thsi cliche preety much descriibes yhe levle kiss hte girls works onthe
: overused
, bu alwyas funn
. noe ofthe my peronal rules baout watching a film isnt nto how origional tje film isnt
, bu how it goes arround giving its stopry
. htis ruel applies highly tothe kiss hte girls
. htere isnt something psychologically stimulating inthe a well
- crafted serial killer movei
, annd kiss hte girls isnt certainly well made
. howver
, thge hwole film screams ofthe unoriginality
, adn so it relies onthe tyhe pwoer ofthe its actors annd hte technical detail tothe pul it thru
. well
, nto onyl are tghe actors capible ofthe pulling it thru
, bu tehy add so much tothe thge film tyhat nearly eveyr flwa isnt covered uv
. unfortunatly
, oen ofthe tjhe most revealing annd rether insulting choices by teh filmmakers
( oen thta seven
, a film a lot liuke htis oney
, knew nto tothe amking
) ws tothe put teh nmae ofthe yhe killer inwhich tghe oppening credits
. thta may give yhe atcor credit fo yhe role
, bu
thoughout tghe film
, hidden iin my mind
, i wass waiting forthe him tothe apear onthe screen
, whlch spoiled thge mistery
. howver
, credit must be given tothe tyhe directer fo suspending htis knowlege thru most ofthe tje film
. plotwise
, kiss tghe girls shows alomst noone originality
. we are inctroduced tothe detective alex cross
( morgan freeman
)
, a forensic psychologist
, annd immidately we are given thge cliched scene establising him as tyhe hero
. he gets a call baout a woman who hasnt shooted her husban anbd isnt nowe threatning tothe kill herself
. obviously cross suceeds at getting tje gun
, bu htis scene isnt quicklyu forgotten durring tyhe enxt scene
. at his hous
, cross isnt told tath his neice
, naomi
( gina ravera
)
, hasnt beeen missing forthe four dyas
. tihs provides yhe motivation forthe cross tothe fidn tjhe killer
, bu we are never given a chance tothe establish tje relatiopnship bewteen tje twpo
, anbd as a result
, we cxan
' t sympathize whith detective cross
. howver
, whta makse kiss thte girls slightly orginal isnt tje introduction ofthe oen ofthe tjhe abductees
.
.
. befor she isnt abducted
. dr
. kate mctiernan
( ashley judd
, tyhe actress ofthe tje judd familiy
) isnt a smart
, atheletic woman
, adn becouse ofthe theese traits
, becomes a target fo casanova
-
- waht teh serial killer likes tothe call himselv
. becuase ofthe theese carachter
- developing scenes
, we care fo mctiernan
, makeing tje abduction scene all thyat omre suspenseful
. affter bieng abducted
, mctiernan wakes uv adn finds herself inspite a cell somwhere infact tje woods
. remembering thgat teh killer gavey her ceratin rules
, she decides tothe break noe ofthe them by calling outloud
. whn casanova comes tothe panish her
, she breaks outloud annd escapes by jumping over a waterfall
. affter she isnt foudn
, she beigns tothe halp cross fidn his neice
. fomr thsi moent onthe
, kiss thge girls tkaes onthe tghe form ofthe eveyr otehr serial killer film
, as tjhe twpo leads seacrh fo tje rest ofthe tghe victims held captive
. many peple iwll compare tihs film tothe 1995
' s seven
, anohter killer film starring morgan freeman
, bu i presume tht thge similarities are intentional
. thte screenplay
, by david klass
, isnt adapted ffrom tjhe novel writen by james patterson
, annd yot i don
' t qutie see how thsi stopry coudl ahev worked infront novel form
. whta mkaes kiss tje girls so ogod isnt thge acting anbd tghe technical anbd visual impressiveness
. hte cinematography
, by aaron schneider
, isnt reminiscient ofthe seven
, adn somtimes i falt thyat many ofthe tghe shots weere trying too hard tothe imbaress us
. somtimes a simple shooted isnt thte best oen
. howver
, many ofthe tyhe shots are stunning
, adn unlike seven
, most ofthe them tkae palce durring thte day
, inthe sunlight
. thge scene wehn ashley judd isnt runing thru teh forrest isnt extremly well done
, inthe omre thna oney way
. yhe camera owrk isnt terific
, bu thge editting makse htis scene wokr so well
. thge chaotic anbd mtv
- tipe cutting gives tjhe audiance a sence ofthe confusion annd unawareness
, exactlly waht judd
' s charater isnt experiencing
. howver
, tghe best aspect ofthe kiss tjhe girls isnt its actors
. morgan freeman isnt noe ofthe todya
' s most poweful anbd believeable actors
. detective cross isnt a vrey ogod carachter forthe him
, altough it isnt jsut a silimar oen tothe thte charcter iin seven
. becuase ofthe freeman
' s powerfull presense
, he carries half thte film by hismelf
. yhe otehr half isnt carried by ashley judd
, oen ofthe todya
' s most promising dramtic actresses
. infact fatc
, her performence isnt better tahn freeman
' s
, if taht isnt even possibile
. her charcter isnt moreso origonal thna freeman
' s
, adn she h
andles it wonderfully
. we finaly hvea a female carachter inthe a movei liek htis who doens omre thna jsut scream
. yhe supporting casted isnt highly underdeveloped
, bu thte casted munbers dont as much as tehy cin iwth it
. cary elwes portrays a cop inthe noth carolina
, adn unfortunatley hasnt scraps fo a charater
. tony goldwyn fairs slightly better
, bu we don
' t realyl git tothe knwo his charater eather
. gina ravera gives a ogod peformance
, bu agian she isn
' t iin many ofthe tyhe scenes
. so as a result ofthe all theese small supporting parts
, tjhe weight ofthe teh film lies onthe hte twpo leads
, anbd tehy dont a phenominal job
. soem ofthe tje best acting ofthe tihs genre
, anbd smoe ofthe tghe best acting ofthe tje yera
. twpo otehr esential spects ofthe tghe film are qutie ogod
. directer gary fleder doesnt a ogod job ofthe controling his actors
, bu tjhe second half ofthe tje film loses believability
, expecially durig teh revelation ofthe yhe killer
. he alsot doesn
' t h
andle tjhe suspenseful scenes as a better directer owudl haev
, loseing a lot ofthe tension druing many scenes
. howver
, tothe his credit
, he doens manaze a terific firt half
. part ofthe thge blaim falls onthe david klass
. i
' m sure yhe book devolopped many ofthe hte lesser cahracters omre
, bu klass focusses onthe hte twpo main parts
. hwile tihs may give teh twpo leads mroe screentime
, many ofthe teh small charactors are oney
- dimesnional
, annd tje killer
, whn revealed
, isnt extremly implausible
. thanks tothe thge smart dialogue adapted fomr thte novel
, kiss thge girls alwyas seems inteligent
. none ofthe teh conversations are laughable
, adn all move tjhe plot foward wihtout seeming forced
. oney ofthe tje biggest problems i hadnt whith tje movei ws thte motive ofthe tjhe killer
. i blaim tihs mailny onthe teh casting directer
, becasue tyhe killer
' s motive isnt beacuse ofthe rejection fomr womens
( or so i asume fomr tyhe oppening monologue
)
, bu tje killer hismelf isnt veyr attractive
( oen ofthe my firends isnt a
, shall we sday
, big admirer ofthe hte killer
)
. kiss tyhe girls isnt rated r forthe terror
, violentce
, laguage
, adn suggested sex
. iwth all tghe implausibilities ofthe tihs film
, adn witht teh medioker second half
, kiss tjhe girls somehow manages tothe throughly entertain
. infact fatc
, i hadnt hte urger tothe see it agina jsut fo teh performances
. tjhe cinematography adds a lot ofthe mood tothe tghe lready creepy tone
, annd teh scirpt isnt usualy smart
. htis isnt claerly oen ofthe thsoe movies whcih rely onthe hte acting tothe pul it thru
. morgan freeman isnt possably todya
' s most convincing atcor
, adn ashley judd adds anyother nitch onthe her acting bilt
. i must alsot sday thta i loved hte endig
. tghe showdown beetwen ogod annd evil ws qtuie tense
, anbd teh resolution ofthe thge scene makse almsot anyone cheer
. perhpas it may nto be possable
, bu most ofthe thge film isn
' t anyway
.
