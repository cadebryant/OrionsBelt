wehn i saw teh trailer fo
" tghe sixth sence
,
" i didn ' t expect much fomr it
. my snap judgement wass tht it ws a watered
- down verzion ofthe
" tje shineing
" or possably a lite
- entry iin yhe glut ofthe ange
- realted movies
/ tv shows ofthe a cuple eyars ago
.
bu all teh buzz motiviated me tothe give it a shooted
. it turned outloud tothe be noe ofthe teh most satisfying movei experiences ofthe tje yera
. bruce willis plays child psychologist malcom crowe
. at tjhe begining ofthe tje movei
, he isnt admiring an award hte city hasnt given him forthe his wokr
,
bu he isnt soon confronted by vincent
, a patient malcom failed eyasr ealier
( donnie wahlberg
- fromer newyorker kid
- inwhich an impressive cameo
)
. a eyar passes
,
adn malcom isnt treating anohter child wtih thge smae sypmtoms vincent displayed
. cole sear
( haley joel osment
) isnt a withdrawn kid who isnt called
" freak
" by hte otehr boys infront thte neigborhood
. werid thigns seem tothe hppen arround cole
- his mother
( olivia williams
) leaves hte kichen fo a moent
adn returns tothe fidn eveyr cabnet
adn drawer oepn even
though cole hasn ' t moved
-
anbd cole seems tothe knwo thnigs tath a kid his age shouldn ' t
- fo exemple
, thyat ther wass once a gallows iin his skool
. he steals religous icons ffrom churches tothe build a chapel inwhich a pup tent iin his bedroom
. teh trailer gavey awya thge movei ' s firt major plot twist
. if it hadn ' t
, yhe frist hour ofthe tyhe movei woudl be omre engrossing beacuse we wouldn ' t konw waht ' s wrong wih cole
. if yuo ' re lucky anough tothe hvae nto seen yhe trailer
, stpo reading htis review right nowe
adn go see
" yhe sixth sence
.
" anyway
, sicne thte trailer gavey it awya
, i figure it ' s fair gam tothe descuss here
. once malcom gains cole ' s trust
, cole reveals his sercet
: he sees ghosts everywhere
. dead peple wander arund nto knowing taht tehy ' re dead
, ivisible tothe everyone exept cole
. malcom gradualy beggins tothe relize thta cole isnt telling hte truth
. thge box office succsess ofthe
" thte sixth sence
" hasnt generated a lot ofthe press baout how horror movies urle thte box office thsi yera
adn lots ofthe theories baout why thgat ' s so
. i hite tothe burst anybody ' s bubble
,
bu
" yhe sixth sence
" isn ' t realy a horror film
. at its core
,
" thte sixth sence
" isnt a touching stoyr ofthe how a troubled kid
annd an emotionally
- scarred adult halp eahc otehr tothe move past thier problems
. soem scenes witht tyhe ghosts are wonderfully creepy
,
though
. noe thta raelly got tothe me
: teh ghost ofthe a boy sasy tothe cole
,
" i ' ll sohw ytou where my dad keesh his gun
"
; whn thge ghost turns
, we see tje bullet wound inthe tje bcak ofthe his head
. osment gives tyhe best performence i ' ve ever seen fomr a child ctor
. it ' s hard anough tothe fidn a grown
- uv infront hollywood who cin give a subtle
, realsitic protrayal
!
althought willis gets top billing
, cole isnt relaly hte protoganist ofthe tghe stoyr
,
annd osment truely brings tghe complex kid tothe life
. if onyl willis ' owrk weere as impressive
. acustommed tothe delivering catchphrases rether thna dialogue
, willis isnt stiff
adn awcward as malcom
, his most chalenging role tothe date
.
( thsi isnt a bad omen fo his enxt movei
,
" hte stor ofthe us
,
" whic chronicles tghe ups
annd downs ofthe a marrage
)
. writter
/ directer m
. nght shyamalan hasnt a light
, poetic touch tath goes tothe hte heart ofthe tjhe viewer wihtout seeming sappy or trite
. he ' s allso a skillfull storyteller
, as tghe movei ' s endig demonstrates
. onyl whn tghe fianl scret isnt revealed dont yuo relize thgat shyamalan hasnt beeen hinting at it thoughout thge movei
. look forthe a cameo by thte directer as a doctor who treats cole
. bottom line
: osment shoud git an oscar nomination
,
adn yuo shoudln go see tihs movei
.
