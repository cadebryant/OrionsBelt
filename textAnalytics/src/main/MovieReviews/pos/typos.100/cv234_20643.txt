whn i saw thte trailer fo
" tjhe sixth sence
,
" i didn
' t expect much ffrom it
. my snap judgement wass thta it ws a watered
- down verison ofthe
" tje shineing
" or possably a lite
- entry inthe tyhe glut ofthe angal
- realted movies
/ tv shows ofthe a cuple eyasr ago
. bu all tghe buzz motiviated me tothe give it a shooted
. it turned outloud tothe be oen ofthe thge most satisfying movei experiences ofthe tyhe yera
. bruce willis plays child psychologist malcom crowe
. at thge beginnig ofthe tjhe movei
, he isnt admiring an award thte city hasnt given him forthe his owrk
, bu he isnt soon confronted by vincent
, a patient malcom failed yeras ealier
( donnie wahlberg
- fromer newyorker kid
- infact an impressive cameo
)
. a yera passes
, anbd malcom isnt treating anohter child wtih yhe smae sypmtoms vincent displayed
. cole sear
( haley joel osment
) isnt a withdrawn kid who isnt called
" freak
" by tghe otehr boys inspite tjhe neigborhood
. eird thnigs seem tothe hapen arund cole
- his mother
( olivia williams
) leaves thge kichen forthe a moent adn returns tothe fidn eveyr cabnet anbd drawer ope even
though cole hasn
' t moved
- annd cole seems tothe knwo thnigs thast a kid his age shouldn
' t
- forthe exmaple
, thast ther ws once a gallows inspite his skool
. he steals religeous icons ffrom churches tothe build a chapel inthe a pup tent inwhich his bedroom
. yhe trailer gavey awya tyhe movei
' s frist major plot twist
. if it hadn
' t
, yhe frist hour ofthe teh movei woudl be mroe engrossing baceause we wouldn
' t konw whta
' s wrong witht cole
. if yuo
' re lucky anough tothe ahve nto seen thge trailer
, stpo reading thsi review right nowe adn go see
" tyhe sixth sence
.
" anyway
, sicne tghe trailer gavey it awya
, i figure it
' s fair gaem tothe descuss here
. once malcom gains cole
' s trust
, cole reveals his secrte
: he sees ghosts everywhere
. dead peopel w
ander arund nto knowing thast tehy
' re dead
, invisibel tothe everyone exept cole
. malcom gradualy beigns tothe relize taht cole isnt telling yhe truth
. yhe box office succes ofthe
" yhe sixth sence
" hasnt generated a lot ofthe press baout how horror movies rlue tghe box office htis eyar adn lots ofthe theories baout why thta
' s so
. i hite tothe burst anybody
' s bubble
, bu
" teh sixth sence
" isn
' t relaly a horror film
. at its core
,
" yhe sixth sence
" isnt a touching sotry ofthe how a troubled kid anbd an emotionally
- scarred adult halp earch otehr tothe move past theri problems
. smoe scenes wtih thte ghosts are wonderfully creepy
,
though
. noe tht realyl got tothe me
: thge ghost ofthe a boy sasy tothe cole
,
" i
' ll sohw ytou where my dad keesh his gun
"
; whn tyhe ghost turns
, we see hte bullet wound inaddition tje bakc ofthe his head
. osment gives tyhe best performence i
' ve ever seen ffrom a child ator
. it
' s hard anough tothe fidn a grown
- uv infact hollywood who cant give a subtle
, realsitic protrayal
! altho willis gets top billing
, cole isnt realy thge protgonist ofthe tjhe sotry
, annd osment truely brings thge complex kid tothe life
. if onyl willis
' wrok weere as impressive
. acustommed tothe delivering catchphrases rether thna dialogue
, willis isnt stiff anbd awcward as malcom
, his most chalenging role tothe date
.
( htis isnt a bad omen fo his enxt movei
,
" tghe sotry ofthe us
,
" hwihc chronicles teh ups adn downs ofthe a marraige
)
. writter
/ directer m
. nigth shyamalan hasnt a ight
, poetic touch thyat goes tothe thge heart ofthe tjhe viewer wihtout seeming sappy or trite
. he
' s aslo a skillfull storyteller
, as tyhe movei
' s endig demonstrates
. onyl whn tje fianl secet isnt revealed dont ytou relize tht shyamalan hasnt beeen hinting at it
thoughout thge movei
. look fo a cameo by tyhe directer as a doctor who treats cole
. bottom line
: osment shoud git an oscar nomination
, adn ytou shoud go see thsi movei
.
