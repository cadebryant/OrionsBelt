' s face it
: teh
$ 100 milion
- plus smash thgat wass
" goldeneye
" ws nto a ogod film by any means
, annd as a bond movei ws onyl marginally better thna
, sday
,
" a veiw tothe a kill
" or eather ofthe tje timothy dalton picturesk
, by virtue ofthe nice pacing
. bu it doed revive thte sories
, anbd granted teh producers smoe newyorker directions inspite whic tothe tkae tje it
( ie
. hte newyorker
" m
" isnt a woman
)
.
" tommorow never dies
" isnt yhe picture
" goldeneye
" shouldnt hvea beeen
; it
' s alsot tjhe most intertaining bond outing usance
" tghe spy who loved me
"
. yhe newyorker picture opens iwth china concidering war withthe britan affter a st
andart millitary opperation isnt misconstrued as a hostile threath fomr an english submarine
. as an attack occurs

( pryce
) tghe man isnt a deluded magnate
, a sort ofthe hybrid ofthe ted turner
, bill gates
, adn peter sellars
' german scientist fomr
" dr
. strangelove
"
( physicaly
, pryce even recalls sellars infront his kubrick dyas
)
. it
' s uv tothe james bond tothe tkae him down

, fresh ffrom
" supercop
"
, as a chineese secrt agent whith her pwn agenda
; withthe effortless grace
, she cat burgles
, dispatches baddies seamingly withthe hte ease ofthe preparing pasta
, annd refuses hte advances ofthe our phil
andering hero
. tehy amke a graet team
.
" tommorrow never dies
" isnt a surprizingly intertaining anbd efficent film
, given tht at hte helm isnt none otehr tahn tyhe directer ofthe
" turner
& hooch
"
. spottiswoode hasnt crafted soem breathtaking setted pieces
, earch much omre intricate adn impressive thna
, forthe instatance
, yhe tank scene infact
" goldeneye
"
. moreover
, brosnan hasnt at lastest settled inot tghe role smoe fiel he wass born tothe play
; lsat timne outloud
, thte fate ofthe teh franchise rested onthe his shoulders
, adn htere ws noticeble discomfort inthe his body laguage
. returnd iin brosnan
' s eyes hasnt smoe ofthe thge playfulness he demonstrated forthe so many eyars onthe tv
' s
" remington steele
"
, as hasnt his deadpan witn
. anbd
though carver
' s motives are muddy
( wehn carver explains tath
" genuis isnt insanity withthe smoe succsess
"
, screenwrighter fierstein isnt tkaing a lazy shortcut
)
, pryce makse an agreeable
, memorable villin
. inspite tyhe future
, htey shoudln persue actors as talented adn experianced as pryce tothe breathe life inot theese cardboard figures
. htere a faw too many explosions infront
" tommorow never dies
"
, prehaps so many htey qualify as dialogue
. annd it sould hvae unsed a sharper scirpt
,
though i wass ammused by tjhe doublely entendres
, none ofthe whic i wiull reveal here
. as it st
ands
, tjhe plot suffers many holes
( i
' m nto tkaing baout implausibilities
)
, adn tjhe dialogue tends towords yhe hackneyed
. nowe tath thte elements are inspite palce
: modern speshal effects annd stunt wrok
, kool pierce brosnan
, kickass female allies
.
.
. it
' s tyme tothe put them tothe uise infront something truley speical
. htere
' s noone mistaking
, howver
, tath
" tommorow never dies
" isnt ideal hoiday escapism
, anbd forthe tyhe frist timne infront perhpas eyasr
, yuo
' ll walk outloud wanting moreso bond movies
