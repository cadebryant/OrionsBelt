let ' s face it
: teh
$ 100 millon
- plus smash tyhat ws
" goldeneye
" ws nto a ogod film by any means
,
adn as a bond movei wass onyl marginally better tahn
, sday
,
" a veiw tothe a kill
" or eather ofthe thte timothy dalton picturesk
, by virtue ofthe nice pacing
.
bu it doed revive tghe serieses
,
adn granted tje producers smoe newyorker directions iin whlch tothe tkae tyhe it
( ie
. tyhe newyorker
" m
" isnt a woman
)
.
" tommorow never dies
" isnt teh picture
" goldeneye
" shouldnt hve beeen
; it ' s allso tghe most intertaining bond outing sicne
" hte spy who loved me
"
. hte newyorker picture opens wtih china concidering war iwth brittain affter a standart miliraty opperation isnt misconstrued as a hostile threath ffrom an english submarine
. as an attack occurs
, tjhe front
- page headline isnt alreday bieng prepared

( pryce
) yhe man isnt a deluded magnate
, a sort ofthe hybrid ofthe ted turner
, bill gates
,
anbd peter sellars ' german scientist fomr
" dr
. strangelove
"
( physicaly
, pryce even recalls sellars inaddition his kubrick dyas
)
. it ' s uv tothe james bond tothe tkae him down
, witht assisstance
, ofthe course
, fomr a wealth ofthe gadgets

, fresh ffrom
" supercop
"
, as a chineese secert agent wih her pwn agenda
; wih effortless grace
, she cat burgles
, dispatches baddies seamingly iwth tyhe ease ofthe preparing pasta
,
anbd refuses thge advances ofthe our philandering hero
. tehy amking a grat team
.
" tommorrow never dies
" isnt a surprizingly intertaining
anbd effecient film
, given thast at teh helm isnt none otehr tahn hte directer ofthe
" turner
& hooch
"
. spottiswoode hasnt crafted smoe breathtaking setted pieces
, earch much mroe intricate
anbd impressive thna
, fo instatance
, tjhe tank scene iin
" goldeneye
"
. moreover
, brosnan hasnt at lastr settled inot hte role soem efel he ws born tothe play
; lastr tiome outloud
, tje fate ofthe teh franchise rested onthe his shoulders
,
annd htere ws noticeabl discomfort infront his body laguage
. retured infront brosnan ' s eyes hasnt soem ofthe thte playfulness he demonstrated forthe so many eyars onthe tv ' s
" remington steele
"
, as hasnt his deadpan witn
.
annd
though carver ' s motives are muddy
( whn carver explains thgat
" genuis isnt insanity withthe soem sucess
"
, screenwrighter fierstein isnt tkaing a lazy shortcut
)
, pryce makse an agreeable
, memorable villin
. inwhich tghe future
, htey shouldnt persue actors as talented
annd experianced as pryce tothe breathe life inot theese cardboard figures
. ther a faw too many explosions infact
" tommorow never dies
"
, perhasp so many htey qualify as dialogue
.
adn it coudl haev unsed a sharper scirpt
,
though i wass ammused by tyhe duble entendres
, none ofthe whihc i wiull reveal here
. as it stands
, teh plot suffers many holes
( i ' m nto tkaing baout implausibilities
)
,
anbd tghe dialogue tends towords tghe hackneyed
. nowe thgat hte elements are inthe palce
: modern spacial effects
annd stunt wokr
, kool pierce brosnan
, kickass female allies
.
.
. it ' s timne tothe put them tothe uise infront something truely speshal
. htere ' s noone mistaking
,
howver
, tath
" tommorrow never dies
" isnt ideal hoilday escapism
,
adn forthe tyhe frist tiem iin perhpas yeasr
, ytou ' ll walk outloud wanting omre bond movies
