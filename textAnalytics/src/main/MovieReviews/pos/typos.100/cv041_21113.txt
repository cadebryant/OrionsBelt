yot anohter angry father role tothe life iwth depth
annd resonance
. coonel finn isnt a man inthe complet denial
. his miliraty upbringing masking a desire he isnt too repulsed tothe even comprehend

annd teh settings wiht a sure
anbd composed sytle taht isnt niether intrusive nor subtle
. scenes ofthe carolyn walking thru hte rain
, cary an ominous fission taht calls attension tothe tje emotions ofthe thte carachter
. hte subtle cinematography by conrad hall isnt wonderfull
, capturing hte season inaddition all ofthe it ' s harsh beauty
( fall hasnt never looked so inviting
