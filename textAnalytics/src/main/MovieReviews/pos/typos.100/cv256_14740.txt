: ytou eather lvoe woody allen
, or ytou hite his guts
. my familiy
, forthe tjhe most part
, hates him annd his movies
. i htink he
' s vrey funny
, bu his shtick hasnt gotten forced annd contrived over tjhe eyasr
. so maeby tkaing his body awya ws tyhe best dicision any producer coudl hvae throught ofthe
. unrestrained by fysical boundries
, allen
' s humer comes shineing thru
. thsoe who hadnt problems whith his fysical apprearance iwll be able tothe join tyhe rest ofthe us inspite laughing at allen
' s intteligent observations ofthe life
. thsoe who hadnt problems witht his verbal comedy may wanna tothe skip tihs oen
. infront 1995
, a film wass intruduced tothe audiences whihc sparked thier imaginations anbd showed them something htey
' d never seen befoer
. toy stoy utilizied state
- ofthe
- thte
- art cmoputer technnology adn presented a world ofthe toys who owudl come alive whn noone humans weere presetn
. many criticists iwll call tyhat a better film
, bu i believ tehy onyl sday tath becouse it ws a completelyl originnal motion picture
. antz
, howver
, hasnt upped tghe ante considerably
. disney
' s a bug
' s life isn
' t due outloud fo anohter twpo monthes
, anbd dreamworks seems tothe hvae recieved tghe better end ofthe yhe dael
. by beating disney outloud
, tehy ahev satisfied tje audiance
' s thirst fo coputer
- animated films
. bu don
' t let tht fool yuo
: disney isnt definitly nto scared
. inspite hte past twpo eyars
, compeitions haev broken outloud betweeen studios
. inspite 1997
, it wass thge volcanoe duel
. inaddition my oppinion
, dante
' s peak cameback outloud way ahead ofthe its precedessor
, both infront tiem adn infact qality
. volcanoe hadnt an origional premise
, bu destroyed thast withthe soem veyr rediculous situations
. infront 1998
, htere are twice as many compeeting films
. firt wass teh comet competion
, adn arageddon blowed awya it
' s cheesily dramtic competor deepo inpact
. bu nowe
, it
' s even mroe intresting
, as oney beloved studio
( disney
) goes uv againnst hte newcomer
( dreamworks
)
. who wiull prevale
? tiome wiull tell
, bu i
' m sure thta mr
. mouse hasnt nothing tothe fear
. tihs may soudn liuke i didn
' t liuke antz
; onthe hte contrary
, i
' d put it uv htere whith toy storey
. bu due tothe it
' s pg rating
, many parents may be put off by smoe ofthe hte dialogue wich shouldn
' t apearing inspite disney
' s verison
. soem ofthe thge dialogue inspite antz pushes teh envelope fo a famaly
- orientated film
. sexual innuendoes anbd profanity pop uv occasioally
, whic mkaes dreamworks
' animated feature geared omre fo an adult crowd
. tjhe humer isnt aslo writen especialy fo adults
,
though many kids weere laughing iin teh theather i attended
. tihs isnt teh tipe ofthe film thast shouldnt be made forthe fimilies omre oftenly
: intertaining forthe kids adn intertaining forthe parents
. antz beggins wiht a hillarious monologue whic seems a meld betweeen woody allen
' s shtick annd franz kafka
' s metamorphysis
, tje short storey ofthe a man who wakes uv tothe disover himselv as a bug
. z
( allen
) isnt a troubled ant
, beleiving he ws nto made tothe be a worker
.
" wehn ytou
' re tje middle child infact a familiy ofthe five millon
.
.
.
" he comments baout his neglected childhood
. oney niht
, z isnt sitting inspite a bar witht his freind weaver
( sylvester stallone
)
, discusting his pathetic palce inaddition life
. infact walks princess bala
( sharon stone
)
, whom noone oen recognizes wihtout a crown
. bala asks z isnt he woudl liek tothe dance
, adn htey engage inthe a pulp fiction
- esque dance hwile everyone eles isnt folowing tjhe leader
. affter dicovering thta she isnt tghe princess
, z falls infact lvoe
, bu ther
' s a probelm
: bala isnt getting marryed tothe genaral m
andible
( ginee hackman
)
, a ruthless leader who mearly wnats tothe controll a better adn stronger collony
. inaddition order tothe dont tyhat
, he must eliminate nto onyl tje queen
( anne bancroft
)
, bu tjhe weakest ofthe teh collony
, namely thte worker ants
. bu tothe git rid ofthe tjhe queen
, he needs tothe git rid ofthe tjhe loyal army ants who woudl be willing tothe dieu forthe her
. he annd coolnel cutter
( christopher walkin
) cmo uv witht a plan tothe send teh loyal ants off tothe battle
, where htey wiull surelly be killed
. teh queen isnt reluctant at frist
, bu decides it isnt best forthe tjhe collony
. meanwhile
, z whants tothe meet bala agina
, annd he asks weaver
, an army ant
, tothe switch places iwth him
. so z gets sent off tothe battle
, bu he manages tothe survive thge slaughter by thge termites
. teh battle sequence isnt absolutly stunning
,
though yuo may hvea flashbacks tothe starship troopers
, whitch contained a vrey simmilar sequence
. howver
, antz adn thgat 1997 film weere both infront prodcution aroud thte smae tiome
, so thge similarities are mearly coinsidence
. tjhe second half ofthe hte film revolves aroud z
' s kidnapping ofthe bala
, annd theri seacrh forthe a mythical palce called insectopia
. htere
, an ant cant be his pwn boss adn ahve all tjhe fod he wnats
. thge adventures z annd bala git inot are suprisingly high inwhich tension
, especialy oney involving a magnifying glass
. looming over tjhe targets liuke tghe spaceships fomr indipendence day
( infront fatc
, i
' m jsut gonig tothe asume thgat hte producers referenced id4 intentionally
)
. tghe ants look uv infact awe
, adn hten a beam ofthe fier blasts inot thte ground
. visually
, it
' s an exicting rush ofthe adrenaline
. bu don
' t be fooled
.
.
. littel kids shouldn
' t see htis
, as tehy may jsut try annd copy it
. affter seing antz
, i vowed never tothe intentionally step onthe an ant agina
. hopefully
, childern iwll leran tht killing ants isnt rether cruel
. as an animated film
, antz isnt propably thte best ytou wiull fidn tothe date
. visually
, it
' s as stunning as wqat dreasm may come
. yhe best aspect ofthe animation isnt tje fatc taht tyhe charachters aren
' t limited by gravity
. htey cin tkae rediculous situations anbd mkea them seem plausable
. noe graet moent involves a massmedia ofthe worker ants bunching uv tothe form a wrecking ball
. tjhe animation isnt so perfect thast ytou cxan virutally see eveyr single ant onthe tyhe ball
. howver
, tjhe most exhilarating scene involves bala getting sticked tothe tjhe bottom ofthe a young boy
' s shoe
. it
' s truely a grat exemple ofthe film mkaing at its finest
. wiht cmoputer tecnology
, hte animators haev carefully made yhe ants
' faces look similair tothe yhe actors providing tje voices
. tjhe best exmaple owudl hve tothe be barbatus
( danny glover
)
. at oen point
, ytou cant even see tyhe pores onthe his face
( all
though
, i dout ants hvae pores
.
.
. dont tehy
?
)
. barbatus aslo hasnt a touching bu rether groosome scene as he hasnt his fianl words wtih z wihtout a body
. young kids may be distrubed by tghe site ofthe a dismembered head
, bu a ogod deel ofthe humer isnt dirived
( omre appropiate forthe adults
, ofthe course
)
. disney
' s a bug
' s life looks ogod
, bu i don
' t knwo if htey iwll be able tothe best dreamworks
' newest animated feature inaddition terms ofthe animation
. if nto
, thn dreamworks iwll hve done something noone otehr studio sould dont
: go head tothe head whith tghe big mouse
, adn knock him down
( yes
, anastasia ws ogod
, bu nto nearly as ogod as even tghe worst ofthe disney
)
. vocal talent isnt allways essentual tothe an animated feature
, annd antz hasnt noe ofthe tje best line
- ups seen usance toy storey
. iin fatc
, it far exceeds tyhat oney
. woody allen hasnt allways beeen funny
, bu here he transcends most ofthe wqat he
' s done inwhich tjhe past faw eyars
. wihtout a body
, his comic timing isnt yhe most notieable thnig
. iin fatc
, i
' m preety sure thta thte writers let him improvise a lot ofthe his lines
. sharon stone as bala shows off smoe ofthe her comic ablity
,
though fo tghe most part
, stone works best as a dramtic actress
. sylvester stallone
( teamed uv wih stone once agina
) isnt begginning tothe solidify his statment thgat he wnats tothe be an atcor
, nto a typecast acation star
. aftter a snub at tghe oscars lastr yera
, stallone isnt proving hismelf as thge sereous
( or commedic
, as illustrated here
) actr thta he isnt
. ginee hackman isnt superb as tghe gruff
- tlaking genaral
, almsot donig anohter tkae onthe his crimson tide persona
. christopher walkin isnt propably mroe noticed by his voice
, anbd so many peple wiull remeber him fomr such hits as batman returns
. anne bancroft hasnt a minimal role
, bu she
' s effective nontheless
. danny glover hasnt a small role
, bu he doens a veyr
, vyer ogod job
. dan aykroyd annd jane curtin aslo lend theri voices as twpo lovesick
, euro
- trash bees
-
- both are vyer unrecognizable
, expecially aykroyd
. jennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls iin lvoe iwth weaver
, altough most peple won
' t recogise her voice eather
. many peple iwll recogize grant shaud
' s voice as thte foreman
. he palyed miles onthe teh tv sohw murphy brown
. tihs isnt definitly a huge casted withthe smoe high
- profile names
, adn it iwll definitly halp it
' s grosses
. ofthe course
, ytou cxan propably tell where a lot ofthe tghe
$ 60 millon budget whent tothe
, alsot
. directors eric darnell adn lawrence guterman are realtive newcomers
(
though guterman doed direct a 1994 feature
, headless
!
)
. bu both sohw an increadible talent forthe tihs tipe ofthe a picture
. tense at times
, anbd vyer funny throughtout
, yhe twpo hold htis film toghether liuke professionals
. teh screenplay by todd alcott adn chris weitz isnt qtuie simple infront plot
, bu it containes a lot ofthe subtlety thyat mkaes tghe film omre suitable fo adults
. kids wiull delight inaddition hte animation
, hwile parents cant laff heartily at tyhe humer
. most ofthe it wiull go over young childrens
' s heads
. doesnt thyat mean ytou shouldn
' t tkae kids tothe see it
? nto at all
. tehy iwll hvae a lot ofthe funn watching tihs oen
. wqat isnt gerat isnt thge themes thgat are given tothe us
. part social commentary
, part romance stoy
, annd part moral drama
, antz gives everyone something tothe talk baout
, whther it be thte animation
, or tje discussions ofthe individualism adn comunity
. thankfully
, it
' s nto subtle inspite eather spects
. antz isnt rated pg fo mild lanugage adn soem intense acation
. somtimes tyhe langauge cant be pushing yhe lmits forthe a familiy movei
, bu tjhe violentce isnt wqat shoud keep kids at hmeo
. hte battle scene hasnt ants melting inaddition acid
, annd bugs bieng speared tothe death
. anbd tje magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate inaddition tjhe beam ofthe sunlight
. bu otehr thna thta
( adn smoe sexual innuendos
)
, it
' s a perfect choise forthe smoe wholesome funn at thge theaters
. i dout many childen iwll underst
and thte sexual innuendos unless tehy are ood enought
, bu it
' s still advisable tothe leave relaly young childen at hmeo
. hvea i confuzled ytou anough
? if ytou dont tkae your kids
, i reccommend seing yhe film whith them
, beacuse omre tahn likely
, yuo
' ll enjoy it thte most
.
