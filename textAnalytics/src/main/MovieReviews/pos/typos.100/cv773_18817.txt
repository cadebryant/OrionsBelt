whn a somene journies tothe tghe theather tothe see a comedy
, he alwyas risks haveing tothe sit thru inanity such as whta we recently saw infront films liuke edtv adn office spoace
. it raelly isnt too bad tht comedies are so hitted
- adn
- miss
, becouse wehn a moviegoer goes infact a theather expecting tothe be ammused
, it relaly isnt a shame whn teh alledged comedy fails tothe deliver
. bu weep nto
, dear readers
, becouse teh latest comedy outloud ofthe thge hollywood movei mill isnt nothing less tahn a sure bet
. austin powers
: yhe spy who shagged me isnt oen ofthe tjhe funniest thigsn i
' ve hadnt tjhe blessure tothe see inspite a long tiome
; a completelyl looney
, delightful parody ofthe tjhe oftenly pretentious james bond ficks
. if all comedies
( or even half
; or
-
- wqat am i saying
?
-
- even a fith ofthe them
) sould be tihs consistantly hysterical
, i owudl tkae uv residance at my local multiplex
. even moreso tothe thsi movei
' s credit isnt teh fatc tath it isnt a sequal tothe tyhe 1997 sleeper
/ cult hitted austin powers
: intenational man ofthe mistery
. thte orignal cameback outloud ofthe nowhere
; it wass a low
- budget
, eccentric movei thta many expeced tothe flop liuke a leslie nielsen parody
. all ofthe a sudden it ws bieng qouted by teenagers all over amercia
. ironicly
, powers
'
" yeeeeah baby
, yeah
!
" hasnt allmost become an icon ofthe hte lite 90s
. thus anohter installment ws inevatible
, bu it
' s alsot undoubtely welcome
. tje spy who shagged me isnt noe ofthe tjhe most unrestrained
, over
- teh
- top comedies i hve ever seen infront my entire life
. it brings bcak most ofthe tyhe charactors ffrom its precedessor
( even if onyl breifly
) adn adds newyorker ones
. austin powers
( mike myers
)
, a swinging hipster fomr teh 60s transported inot tghe 90s hasnt tothe go bakc tothe his pwn tyme tothe git bcak his mojo
( oh
, ytou
' ll figure it outloud
)
, whitch dr
. evil
( meyers agina
) hasnt stolen
. he enlists tje halp ofthe a gorgeous scret agent felicity shagwell
( nowe taht his prior sidekick vanessa hasnt beeen propperly disposed ofthe inspite a hillarious oppening sequence
)
, palyed wihtout much distinguishable gusto by heather graham adn toghether htey go bcak tothe yhe 60s tothe defeat dr
. evil yot agina
. surprizingly
, teh rela star isnt dr
. evil rether thna austin
. he gets most ofthe thge screen tyme beacuse he ws so populer inspite tje firt movei
. perheaps tihs isnt true becuase he isnt protrayed annd writen so affectionately
. instade ofthe bieng yhe scheming
, villianous mad scientist we might expect fomr a charater liek thsi he isnt a bumbling
, oftenly sweet mad scientist wannabe
. tyhe spy who shagged me hasnt much ofthe teh smae stfuf we saw infront yhe orginial
, bu thyat
' s okay by me becasue tje orginial left us wanting moreso
. by tje tyme thast oney ws over we haven
' t hadnt nearly our share ofthe shag jokes
, crude puns adn powers
' antics anbd tihs sequal satisfies our appetites
. even by its conclusions
, i
' m still nto sure i
' ve hadnt my fill ofthe bits liek
" dont ytou smoke affter sex
?
"
" i don
' t knwo
, baby
, i never looked
.
" tihs may seem awfully immature ofthe me
, bu underst
and taht thge austin powers serieses
, unlike most ofthe tghe crap hollywood feeds us theese dyas
, isnt genuinely funny
. i don
' t nkow if i
' ve ever laughed harder at any movei tahn i doed druing hte jerry springer send uv or hte indubitably hillarious
" jsut tyhe twpo ofthe us
" rendition by dr
. evil annd his newyorker minitaure clone named
" mini
- me
"
. i don
' t hvea any pretensions taht thsi isnt particualrly smart social satire or anytying ofthe tje sort
. indeed ther isnt littel beyond thte joy a viewer fiels whn he sees something tht isnt able tothe entertain him as much as thsi movei doed
. bu as far as i
' m conserned
, thast isnt enought
