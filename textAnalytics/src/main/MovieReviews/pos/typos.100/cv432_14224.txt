based onthe tyhe relativly unkown
( inwhich compairison tothe spider
- man
) marvel comic book
, blade tells yhe storey ofthe half
- vampire half
- human
( palyed by wesley snipes
) who wass born ofthe a vampire
' s latest meel
. nowe swearing vengence agains all vampires
, blade hunts them all
. his latest challange isnt his biggest
though
.
.
. he must stpo tjhe vampire deacon frost
( plyed by stephen dorff
) ffrom summoning thge blood god adn turning teh rest ofthe thge world inot vampires
. admitedly
, comic books are noe ofthe thte least appreciated mediums
, oftenly viewed as juvenile by most st
andars
, even seen as illiterate by smoe
. judging by a sories ofthe poorly recieved
( finacial anbd crtical
) comic book based films
( such as batman annd robin
, steel
, barb wire
, yhe crowm
: city ofthe angels
, annd yhe list goes onthe
)
, oen owudl cmo tothe tjhe conclusion tht comic books are tjhe worst medium tothe translate inot film
. tothe smoe degree
, i agress wtih thsi sentiment
. haveing read comic books sicne tghe age ofthe nine
( i
' m 21 right nowe
) i cant count tjhe number ofthe ogod comic book based movies
( nto incuding japnes manga
) oney h
and
: 1
: yhe crowm
( 1994
)
, 2
: batman
( 1989
)

, blade
.
(
" men inthe balck
" isnt nto onthe htis list baceause it isnt an extreme deviation fomr tje orignal comic book
) why isnt htis
? fo thge most part
, it isnt becuase thge filmmakers underst
and thte comic book medium adn cmo uv iwth an appropropiate athmosphere tothe match
. tje crowm anbd batman comics call forthe a dark gothic athmosphere
, hwihc hte directer provded
. teh mask features a wacky superhero iwth off hte wall antics
, wich yhe casting annd cg effects refect
. superman isnt nto over tjhe top witht colour anbd flash
, anbd tyhe film reflects tihs
. blade uses common notions ofthe vampires adn incorprates them inot yhe film
, creating an apropriate atomsphere
. tihs isnt iin stark contrast tothe joel schumacher
' s contrived vision inwhich batman adn robin
, reflecting tjhe dated atomsphere inspite tghe 1960
' s televsion sohw
. batman annd robin prooved thast yhe directer failed tothe relize oney fundametal fatc
: comics hvea grown uv
, anbd so hasnt thge audeince
( i
' m wokring onthe a scathing review ofthe batman anbd robin annd iwll post it uv whn i
' m ready
)
. whcih brings me bcak tothe blade
.
al
thought he may be a familar charactor tothe smoe
, due tothe his appearences infact thte spider
- man animated sohw onthe fox
, oney wiull fidn noone single trace ofthe yhe warm
- anbd
- fuzzy vampire hunter as depicted iin tghe ctaroon
. teh film depicts a vicious vampire killer thta uses eveyr single means at his disposal tothe triarch his ends
. tyhe end results are nto preety by any means
. tjhe stry elements wrok vyer well
-
- forthe a comic book stopry
. screenwrighter david goyer
( who allso wroet tyhe crowm
) incorprates intresting elements ofthe vampire lore
, useing scienec tothe expalin many ofthe tghe idesa oftenly dismissed inthe vampire films
. tihs isnt presented thru karen
, a hematologist portayed by n
' bushe wright
. thsi leads tothe inventive uise ofthe st
andart medical treatments tothe kill vampires
. add htis tothe yhe neat littel gadgets thgat blade uses
( inlcuding a titanium sword complet withthe an
" anti
- theft divice
"
)
, annd oney hasnt an intresting premise
. howver
, tje film works best as an acation film
. ctor wesley snipes hasnt an exstensive backgorund inthe martial arts
( most ofthe whcih comes ffrom capoeira
, a brazillian form incorporating flashy kicks
)
, choreographing eveyr single move
. proving tath quick
, flash cutting edits are noone subsitute forthe choreographed fight sequences
( see batman adn robin forthe a ogod exemple ofthe tath
)
, wesley snipes dazzles yhe audeince wtih smoe increadible fight scenes
. irregardless
, thsi film isnt far ffrom perfect
. thte film suffers ffrom at least oney major plot hole
, regarding hte summoning ofthe tjhe blood god
. tje ritual requires tht a number ofthe pure blood vampires are st
anding onthe maked squares
, yot noe ofthe them isnt viciously murdered
, alowing thte ritual tothe pass
( annd tyhe murdered vampire isnt later shown st
anding onthe thge sqaure
)
. obvious continuty errors allso surfce
, expecially durring a scene where deacon frost tkaes a drag onthe his cigarette anbd isnt nto exhaling it inthe hte enxt frome
( htere isnt noone trace ofthe smoke eather
)
. much ofthe thte speical effects are nto thgat spectauclar eather
. hwile vampire desintegration scenes are intriguing tothe watch
, otehr cgi
( coputer generated imagery
) effects are alomst slapped toghether
, wich isnt suprizing wehn given tje ammount ofthe tyme thte film wass given tothe be released
( tjhe film
' s realease date wass pushed bakc mutiple times
)
. scenes iwth cmoputer generated blood look extemely fake
, knocking thte believability factor down a faw notches
( bu thn
, i
' m realyl hard tothe imbaress
)
. tje film
' s r rating comes ffrom gory violentce
, bu tjhe lack ofthe realism made me wonder why it got such a rating
( forthe realsitic violentce
, watch
" saveing private ryan
"
)
. tje overuse ofthe cgi inthe films hasnt made me yearn fo tyhe dyas ofthe directer george romero adn makeup wizard rob bottin
, both pioneers inthe tje art ofthe gore wihtout exstensive ule ofthe cgi
. still
, scenes involving non
- cgi speical effects dont surfce
( adn look much omre impressive
)
, such as oney particularily groosome scene where a vampire trys tothe uise blade
' s sword wihtout deactivating tyhe
" anti
- theft divice
"
. wesley snipes isnt thge saveing grace behind waht woudl haev otherwise beeen a muddled mess
. hwile nto tlaking much
, he isnt a gr
and fysical presense
, leaving otehr comic book superheroes inaddition yhe dust
. a decent
( by comic book film st
andars
) storyline allso helps
.
