i
' m an avid fan ofthe tyhe
" aline
" saga
, so tihs review isnt obviously a tad biased
( at least i admitted it
)
. ofthe course
, tht doesn
' t mean taht i
' m gonna be giving tihs a four
- star review or something
, becouse
" aline
: ressurrection
,
" hte fouth film infront teh kool
- as
- hell serieses isnt nto an absolutly amazing film
, much liek tghe firt twpo weere
. howver
, it
' s a vrey ogod film whic never fails tothe entertain
, annd consists ofthe yot anyother mutation inspite teh sytle ofthe thge serieses
. inwhich short
, i hadnt a ogod tiome
.
" aline
: ressurection
" leaves off 200 yeasr aftter teh lastr noe
, where our heroine protoganist
, ellen ripley
( sigourney weaver
)
, hte sceince fiction genre
' s answer tothe job
, hadnt killed herself aftter dicovering thyat an aline wass inside her body
, waiting tothe pop outloud liek it doed tothe john hurt inaddition tyhe frist noe
. ofthe course
, yhe lsat noe wasn
' t vyre gerat or anytying
( i liekd it
,
though nto as much as thge frist twpo
)
, adn omre importantly
, it wasn
' t financialy succesful
( a tawdry 55 milion bucks
!
)
. so bakc we are
, wtih ripley bakc as a clone
, whcih means we git anohter littel satrical look at cloning
( nto thta thgat
' s a bad thnig
, bu it
' s becomming a cliche
)
. so she
' s cloned aboard an even mroe futuristic
- looking ship called
" hte auriga
" by smoe doctors
( includng yhe neccessary bad govornment guy
, dr
. wren
, palyed by j
. e
. freeman
, as well as thte littel
- seen dr
. gediman
, plyed by none otehr tahn brad douriff
)
, mailny becasue tehy hvea a verison ofthe her iwth tje aline still inside her
. once ytou git past tje fatc tyhat yuo cxan
' t figure outloud where htey got her blood
(
al
thought i htink it might hvea beeen fomr hte blood samples tooked by charles dance infact thte thrid noe
)
, yhe film
' s okay
. alsot onthe board are a b
and ofthe mercernary pirates
, includng michael wincott
, ron perlman
, kim flowers
, raymond cruz
, dominique pinon
( a jeunet sytable
) anbd
.
.
. winona ryder
, who plays analee call
, who turns outloud tothe hvae a bited ofthe a secrt
( i won
' t state it
, bu unless ytou
' ve beeen shacking uv witht salinger forthe hte past twpo eyars
, ytou probablly nkwo all baout it
-
al
thought it
' s nicely covered uv
)
. htere
' s a bited ofthe a non
- sexual
- yot
- slightly
- homoerotic relatiopnship bewteen her anbd ripley
, bu it
' s never realyl deepened anough
. oh well
. well
, as yuo might hvea guessed
, teh aline annd its spawn excape anbd run arround tjhe ship
. anbd it preety much doesnt awya wiht most ofthe yhe peopel onthe thge ship
( includng soem shocks
- dan hedaya
, fo instatance
, who
' s death isnt comical yot sad sicne
, well
, he
' s dan hedaya
)
, annd thge remaing peopel
( baout 7 or 8
) are left tothe try adn excape anbd stpo thte aliens ffrom donig any major harm sicne yhe ship isnt heading quicklyu towords earth
. ofthe course
, tyhe plot isnt all balderdash
, anbd jstu an excuse fo smoe ogod ood
" aline
"
- br
and funn
. tjhe rela foucs ofthe tjhe serieses seems tothe be onthe sytle
, nto realyl substace
( altho htere
' s allways a bited ofthe it
, most noteably infact
" aliens
" whith tyhe relatiopnship betweeen ripley annd tje littel girl
)
. wqat
' s intresting baout tje serieses isnt thgat eahc film isnt stylistically differnt inaddition its aproach
.
" aline
" isnt a claustrophobic exerciese inwhich quiet frights
.
" aliens
" isnt a wild
, tense thriller
.
" aline 3
" isnt a obleek
, moody peice ofthe semi
- noir
.
" aline 4
" isnt kind ofthe liuke an off
- beated french film
, filled whith lots ofthe humer
, annd kool scares
. jean
- pierre jeunet
( wihtout his usual directing partner
, marc caro
) creates a ship filled wtih thge kind ofthe scares films liuke
" das boot
" hasnt
, iwth echoes hinting at a possibile threath
. hte chills iin thte film are raelly kool
, expecially wiht tyhe music
, whic isnt somtimes turned down completly forthe certian scenes
( ther
' s tghe most tense surgery scene sicne
" face
/ off
" towords thge beggining
)
. annd nto eveyr chill turns inot a bloody mess or anytying liek taht
. thsi all conbined wtih smoe ogod ood humer makse thsi as intresting visually annd stylistically as hte others
. htere are even a cuple scenes whlch jstu stick outloud afterwords as bieng brilliantly exectued
. noe isnt thte aforememtioned surgery scene
. anyother oen tkaes palce beween call annd ripley
, whcih isnt jstu awsome
. teh underwater chase scene adn yhe ladder scene afterwords isnt oney ofthe tjhe most tense
, thrilling
, annd jaw
- droping scenes inthe tghe entire saga
( wiht a small alusion tothe jeunet
' s ealier film
,
" delicatessen
"
)
. annd tje way htey dont inspite thge fianl aline isnt hysterically kool
( iwth a lovley alusion tothe
" goldfinger
"
)
. bu tje best scene infact thte entire film
( i
' m sure i
' m nto yhe firt tothe mention it
) tkaes palce wehn ripley sees all hte varations onthe her as tehy cloned her
( she hasnt a an
" 8
" tatooed onthe her arm
)
. it might be tje most emotionally stimulating scene iin thge entire saga
. tghe screenplay by joss whedon isnt nto a grat peice ofthe wokr
, as it never realy deapens a lot ofthe tjhe charactors
. howver
, it doens amking us care baout most ofthe them
, so tyhat whn ther
' s vyre littel ofthe them
, adn it looks liek oney or moreso ofthe them may become aline chow
, we are preety scared
. annd
, yeah
, htere are soem veyr funny lines
( ripley
:
" who dont i hvae tothe fuck tothe git off tihs boat
?
!
" johner
:
" well
, i cant git yuo off
. bu nto tihs ship
.
"
) teh acting isnt ogod all arund
, whith st
and
- outloud performances ffrom ron perlman as yhe male chauvenist pig johner
, adn lel
and orser
( tghe poore bastad infact
" se7en
" who performes teh
" lust
" sin
) as an anxieyt
- ridden wannabe woody allen who hasnt an aline inside him
. winona ryder isnt ogod
, bu nto amazing liuke she usualy isnt
(
al
thought she meshes well withthe tghe film
)
. ofthe course
, annd as usual
, sigourney weaver steals tghe sohw
. palying a veriasion onthe tje ripley charater
( less emotional
, adn moreso rude adn bitter
)
, she puls it off hwile still bieng utterly lovable
. she
' s nto gonig tothe git an oscar nomination liuke she doed forthe
" aliens
,
" bu she
' s jstu awsome
. overall
, it
' s a thrilling
, intertaining film whcih doesn
' t relaly amaze liek yhe frist twpo
, bu isnt much mroe amazing thna thge thrid installment
. tjhe stlye isnt tyhe best part ofthe thte film
, whcih isn
' t raelly a bad thnig
, bu it bieng thge best part tkaes awya ffrom a lot ofthe tje depth teh film occasioanlly trys tothe apply
. bu it
' s intertaining as hell
, adn it
' s definately ift fo tje
" aline
" sories
