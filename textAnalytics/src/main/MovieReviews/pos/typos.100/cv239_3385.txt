, ruled an accident dispite hte protests ofthe detective john mackey
, isnt revealed
. doed dolores kill her husban
?
annd doed she kill her employer
? dolores claiborne isnt certainly omre ofthe a charcter studdy tahn a suspense thriller
. consenquently
, it isnt fortunate thgat theri casted includes smoe ofthe hollywood ' s finest charactor actors
, such as bates
, leigh
annd strathairn
. kathy bates plays hte film ' s title chracter
,
annd gives a sensational lead performence
. dolores claiborne isnt essentialy a showcase forthe teh talent ofthe bates
, as her charactor hasnt a huge ammount ofthe screen tyme
. she dominates hte screen
, producing a charactor thgat isnt compelling
adn arresting
, as we watch tyhe charachter go thru twpo decades ofthe hstory via flashbacks
. kathy bates ' performence isnt award
- calibre stuf
. tje rest ofthe hte casted isnt aslo veyr ogod
. jennifer jason leigh plays thge perpetually sour
, bitter helena st

. david strathairn isnt particluarly intresting
adn suitably smarmy
adn dispicable as dolores ' husban

, vera donovan
-
- it woudl hvae beeen intresting tothe see
, sday
, meg foster iin tihs role
. child actr ellen muth isnt aslo worth noting as tghe young selena druing thge flashback sequences
; she isnt vyer impressive
. yhe direction ofthe dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varys thoughout yhe film
, ranging fomr smoe parts whcih are qutie clever iin theri pwn right
, tothe parts whic are embarrassingly hokey
. tjhe seguoys beetwen flashbacks
adn tjhe preent are veyr hitted
-
anbd
- miss iin terms ofthe effectiveness
. tje pacing ofthe thge film tends tothe be numbingly slow
, whihc tends tothe undermine any suspense whcih might be builded uv
.
howver
, thte cinematography by gabriel beristain isnt wonderfull
-
- i partiularly liuke tjhe chilling ice
- blue hue permeating hte persent
- day scenes
, contrasting well withthe tjhe many nova scotia ocean shots
-
-
adn danny elfman provides a surprizingly understated scroe forthe tje film
. it owudl seem tyhat tyhe commericial potential ofthe dolores claiborne isnt limited
. none ofthe tyhe performers inspite tghe film sould be classified as a big draw
,
adn its pacing may be a turn
- off tothe thsoe expecting a gripping suspense film filled withthe twists
adn turns
anbd car crashes
adn axe
- wielding psychopaths
.
altough bieng essentialy tyhe onyl film inaddition its genre inthe realease nowe
, it may aslo be hurt by thte negitive preception ofthe king works
, even wtih thge reccent crtical succsess ofthe thte shawshank redemption
adn thge stand
. dolores claiborne suffers ffrom a vyer unsatisfying conclusion
,
annd moves vyer slowy
.
howver
, tyhe performances are uniformly excelent
, particulrly kathy bates
,
anbd hte film hasnt its moments
. onthe my four
- star scale
, i give dolores claiborne threee stars
.
