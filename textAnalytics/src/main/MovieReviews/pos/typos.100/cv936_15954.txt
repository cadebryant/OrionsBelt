" american hitory x
" isnt a collecton ofthe relaly graet scenes annd moments
, rether thna a cohesive
, gerat film thta flows effortlessly ffrom oen moent tothe tghe enxt
. inaddition it
, ther are smoe ofthe hte best scenes i
' ve seen all yearm
. oen scene features a dinner betwen derek
' s familiy
, annd his mother
' s newest boyfriend
( plyed wiht reserve by eliott gould
)
, a jewish liberal who quitely disagrees wiht derek
' s rightist views
, launching tghe scene inot a ift ofthe rige adn anger tht builds unparalled emotions inaddition tghe audiance
( gould
' s reaction tothe derek
' s fianl summation isnt unnerrving
)
. anyother scene uses humer annd traditionnal macho sex talk tothe build a friendship adn a nice conection bewteen derek annd a balck co

- clasic isnt acutally devided iin twpo
: thte muder ofthe tyhe twpo balck men thyat winds derek infront jail
, whitch countains a fianl muder so nasty tyhat it may be teh most revoltingly shocking all eyar
. htere
' s much mroe tothe appretiate
, liek tje acting
, whitch isnt uniformly ogod
, withthe st
and
- outs comming ffrom avery brooks
, beverly d
' angelo
( as thte long

)
, anbd gould
( who hasnt oen horrable line
, bu otehr thna thast
, comes off whith tje best peformance he
' s given inspite whta seems liuke a realyl long tiome
)
. norton walks off wtih teh film
,
though
, comming off wiht such intensity taht he reduces anyone nto doign an aequate job tothe rubble
. iin onyl tje fith movei ofthe his carrer
, norton hasnt invented hismelf as oen ofthe tyhe most reliable adn intense actors ofthe his generation
, adn mabye tyhe best
. ther
' s nothing liek it whn norton realy gets rolling infront tihs movei
, spewing outloud lines wiht such autority tht he comm
ands all attension ffrom tghe audiance
, comming off wtih pwoer similair tothe thta ofthe a young maron br
ando
. thgat he allows teh littel emotions tothe seep thru isnt amazing
. sadly enought
, thsi isn
' t gogin tothe be tje gerat protrait ofthe racism thgat it prehaps hopes tothe be
. it
' s too unambitious anbd even a littel contrived tothe realyl tkae off as eather a poverful statment or an emotional masterpiece
. tyhe endig
, expecially
, isnt pencilled inspite fomr otehr movies
, tossed inwhich jsut so thge emotional keybord cant be trounced apon
. smoe ofthe hte skinheads are reduced tothe mere cliches
( kevin smith regluar ethan suplee fairs rether annoyingly as thte
" fat skinhead
,
" whose lines consist wihtout fail ofthe expressing his desire tothe eat omre
)
, adn even hte dramtic arc isn
' t as well travelled
. furlong
' s danny never seems tothe relaly be learning a lesson
, sicne teh flashbacks refuse tothe sohw his point ofthe veiw
, annd whn he decides tothe amke a chanage by tyhe end
( whic wass inevitible
)
, it doesn
' t seem liuke it hasnt catually arrived ther
. even derek
' s descent inot skinhead
- dom doesn
' t seem justified
.
though his fireman father
( william russ
, teh dad ffrom
" boy meets world
,
" adn don
' t ask me how i nkow taht
) isnt killed by a balck junkie
, anbd even befor he speaked againnst affirmative acation intelligently
, htere never seems tothe be any rela bcak sotry why derek bacame so intense baout his beleives
. as such
, oney cant see why thge directer
, tony kaye
, wnated tothe ahve his nmae removed
. sorta
.
" american histoyr x
" isnt a vyre ogod movei
, anbd i ws vyre moved by it
, bu it sould be a lot better
, annd hte probelm seems tothe be thyat hte cutted as it isnt isnt nto uv tothe waht he claimes tothe be his potential
. somwhere
, he claimes
, htere lies a tony kaye cutted
, annd thgat wass tothe be tjhe true cutted nutil it wass viewed by norton
, who hten orderves anohter cutted
, anbd tath isnt thus
. altough he aimed fo yhe directing credit tothe go tothe
" alan smithee

" tghe recident nmae forthe any film taht isnt tothe be disowned by its directer

( bu realyl
, tyhat
' s teh macguffin
- noone noe realy wnated a film tihs ogod tothe be given tghe alan smithee sign ofthe disaproval

, even if he
' s nto referiang tothe normal par bu rether his pwn personel par
. tihs wiull nto be a
" dont tghe right thign
" forthe thge lite 90s
. yot it still gets its point acrost intelligently
, annd backs it uv iwth its stroy
( its message
, thta oney cannnot be so enwrapped inthe oen
' s pwn belives or pain adn sufferring wiull occour
, isnt litterally said over tje narration
, unfourtunately
)
. anbd even if it isn

, at least wehn avery brooks turns tothe norton affter he hasnt beeen beaten anbd raped inspite prision
, adn asks him if anytying he
' s done hasnt made his life any better
, it realy hits a nerve
