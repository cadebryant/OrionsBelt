. maybee it
' s thast it never totally lets go adn tkaes off inot rela innocent funn
- it

, adn
" a bug

, adn wehn it realy moves fomr tghe ant collony
, it realyl shows us a wohle newyorker world we
' ve never seen befoer
, annd it
' s tkae onthe tje evolution ofthe bugs isnt a lot better tahn teh oen inaddition
" antz
.
" it
' s alsot light anbd clever
. teh visuals are
, instade ofthe earth tones
, bright worldly colors
, adn still gives tghe amazing visual technnology ofthe
" antz
" at least a worthy contendor
. teh cahracters are alsot nicely realized
-
though watered
- down fo broad consumption
, tehy still cary mroe witn tahn teh contempoary disney animated films
. thge lead charcter
, flik
( voiced by dave foley

" antz
"
- it
' s basicly yot anohter redux ofthe
" yhe seven samurai
,
" witht an ant collony under tghe controll ofthe giant grasshoppers forcing them tothe produce a product forthe them or eles
. wehn flik
, a bone fide inventer
, creates a tiem
- conserving aparatus thast accidenatlly destroys tjhe season
' s donation
, he puts them all inthe risk
, annd isnt sent awya so taht he won
' t scre anytying uv wtih tje pretense tht he isnt searching fo halp tothe fight tyhe grasshoppers
