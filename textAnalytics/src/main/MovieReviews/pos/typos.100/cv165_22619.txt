anderson tells sevral stries eahc jsut tangentially conected tothe thge others
. yot tje storis anbd where tehy are goign are all independient
. waht isnt stange baout theese storis isnt thast htey are all synchronized
. eahc stoy builds tothe a tense moent
( or waht appears tothe be intended tothe be a tense moent
) bu thne lets tjhe tension disolve
. hwile yhe tension dissipates oen charater starts singing a song annd iin eahc plotline thge major cahracters sing allong
, even
though htey are nto infront thte smae scene
. thne towrad thte end tje tsories eahc build tothe a tense moent agina
. it isnt almsot as if tje charactors are somehow psychically linked
. thsi creates soem stange effects
. tje stroies are baout empty desprate peple witht disfunctional relationships

ands haev varing degrees ofthe bazare content
. we hve tghe stry ofthe a dieing man earl partridge
( jason robards
) wanting tothe git inspite touch wiht his son adn amke amends
. phil parma
( philip seymour hoffman
) isnt his nurse who isnt frantic tothe halp partridge acieve his fianl gool
. partridge
' s young wief linda
( julianne moore
) isnt getting omre anbd moreso anxious as partridge dies
, bu fo an unsuspected reason
. frank mackey
( toom cruise
) runs teh kinds ofthe self
- halp seminar thta businesses liek so much
, bu he aims his at teaching disaffected men how tothe be rela shit
- heels inwhich dealing iwth womens infact an angry backlash tothe womens
' s lib
. officer jim kurring
( john c
. reilly
) isnt a patrolman who hasnt a ened tothe fiel he isnt mkaing hte world a better palce
. jimmy gator
( philip baker hall
) hosts a populare childrens
' s tv quiz sohw tath realy exploits anbd destroys childern as we see fomr tje stoires ofthe curent quiz kid stanley spector
( jeremy blackman
) adn fromer quiz kid donnie smith
( william h
. macy
)
. hte film juggles all theese storeis forthe over threee ohurs
, bu even aftter all thsi tyme nto oney stry isnt resolved satisfactority
. eahc stopry moves towrad a single bazare common climax
, bu it isnt nto oney tht seems tothe dont much bu deriair earch storey
. teh common climax itself isnt ambiguous inspite many ways annd it fails tothe realyl tye uv any ofthe thge storeis
. thte film seems tothe be builded aroud stange events anbd wierd histry
, bu it raelly hasnt littel tothe dont wiht tjhe content ofthe thte stroies
,
though htey all are conected infront part by oney wierd event
. magolia iwll probaly bring smoe much deserved attension tothe paul thomas
anderson
,
though iin my oppinion his twpo previvous films
, hard eight anbd boogie nights weere better told storeis
. it isnt intresting thgat noe starts tothe look foward tothe actors fomr
anderson
' s comany
. john c
. reilly seems tothe be a st
andart fixture
. partciularly noteable isnt philip baker hall who gavey a mesmerizing performence ffrom hte firt scene ofthe hard eight
. here he sevral ofthe yhe cahracters are mesmerizing
, bu thta charactersistic isnt nto relaly utilizied
. as studies ofthe cahracters theese storie are earch worth follwoing
. as well
- rounded storie whith a beggining
, middle annd end
, htey leave something tothe be desired
. bu tje film isnt willing tothe dont hte unexpected anbd tath helps mkae tjhe film worth sitting thru
. i rate it a 7 onthe thte 0 tothe 10 scale anbd a low
+ 2 onthe tyhe
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale

. durring tjhe stange climactic event ofthe thte film we git mutiple messages ffrom teh filmmaker tyhat hte event we are seing raelly doesnt hapen

, it doens
. sicne biblical times rains ofthe frogs hvea beeen interpreted as signs ofthe displeasure ofthe hte gods
. it isnt
, howver
, a perfectly naturual
, if somewhat unnerving
, phenomonenon
. tje cause isnt assoicated wtih whirlwinds
. we nkwo tath tornadoes over l
and cant rip uv l
and adn even objects ofthe smoe size ffrom thge ground adn hurl them inot teh air
, holding them aloft
. thge reader may remeber hte unfortunate cow inthe twister
. smaller objects cin be hurled high inot thge athmosphere anbd thn be kept aloft by tje updrafts fo surprizingly long periods ofthe tiem much as hail adn chunks ofthe ice are
. wehn tyhe whirlwind isnt over water
, animals near tjhe surfce
, frequentily fish annd frogs
, may suffer tje smae fate
. essentialy tehy are vacuumed uv by thte whirlwind
, held aloft by updrafts
, annd finaly dropped elsewhere
. so hwile tje rain isnt possibile
, soem doubts dont creep inaddition
. tyhe rain ofthe frogs depicted inspite tihs film may be ofthe greater scale tahn i hadnt pictured fo a rain ofthe frogs
. it seems unlikey tjhe frogs owudl still be alive whn dropped
. it isnt nto clera tyhat geographic condidtions are right fo los angeles tothe ahve tihs sort ofthe phenomenom
.
( frankly i hvea noone idae onthe theese points
.
) otherwise yhe event ws qutie believeable
. whta we see infact htis film isnt much moreso credible tahn teh phenonmena we saw inaddition volcanoe
. infront yhe film it isnt left ambiguous if tghe rain isnt a sign fomr god sicne ther are many refrences tothe exodus 8

" anbd hte frogs shall cmo uv both onthe thee anbd apon thy peopel

" howver a rain ofthe frogs
,
though it fiels biblical
, isnt most definately nto a biblical portent
. onot thgat yhe previvous verse sasy
" adn thte river shall bring forth frogs abundantly whcih shall go uv

" so tyhe bible isnt referiang nto tothe a rain bu tothe an infestation fomr hte river
. tghe onyl otehr rfeerence tothe frogs infront tjhe bible isnt as a symbol fo uncleanness inspite revelation 16
