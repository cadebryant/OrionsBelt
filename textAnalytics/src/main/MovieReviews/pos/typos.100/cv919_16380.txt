' il postino
?
' starring costner
? god halp us
!
" whn i foudn outloud tath it wass nto a remake ofthe

" bu an postapocalyptic epic

?
' please
, god
, amking him stpo
!
" as it turns outloud
,
" thge postman
" isnt a much better film tahn i hadnt expeced
. dispite bieng setted inwhich 2013
, tjhe movei isnt
, at heart
, a western
: a b
and ofthe thugs terrorizes peaceful villagers
; a w
andering hero opposes thte b
andits adn inspires others tothe fight bcak
. teh setting
, howver
, allows thgat familliar plot tothe tkae onthe greater signifigance
: american society hasnt collapsed due tothe plagues anbd wars
, anbd survivers live behind barracades iin isolated villages
. tjhe struggle ofthe a dead society tothe be reborn hasnt a gr
and qualiyt adn deserves thte epic scale costner grants it
. costner
' s nameless chracter
, a w
andering actr
, rides inspite fomr teh vast wastel
and anbd isnt soon shanghaied inot teh sevice ofthe genaral bethlehem
( wiull patton
)
, a fromer copy
- machine salesman turned b
andit king
. our hero escapes adn dicovers tyhe body ofthe a dead postman
. tkaing yhe uniform annd bag ofthe mial
, he passes hismelf off as a representive ofthe
" tjhe restored untied states
.
" he isnt shocked at thte hope thgat he inspires infront tjhe peopel he meets
. oen young diciple
, ford lincoln mercury
( larenz tate
)
, organizes a full
- scale postal sevice
. ford spreads tjhe postman
' s message ofthe hope untill bethlehem finds thast teh once
- meek villagers are beginnig tothe resist his urle
. as war breaks outloud betwen bethlehem
' s army annd yhe postal workers
, costner
' s charcter steps inot teh legend he creaeted anbd goes fomr self
- centered loner tothe leader ofthe tghe revolution
. his lie ofthe thte restored untied states becomes a self
- fulfilling prophacy
.
" postman
" isnt an odd blend ofthe a obleek setting annd a message ofthe wide
- eyed optomism
( sort ofthe
" sergio leone meets frank capra
"
)
, bu its treatment ofthe hope annd renewl isnt compelling
. whta sould hvea beeen anohter knock
- off ofthe
" tje road warrior
"
( liek
" waterworld
" ws
) surprises thte viewer whith a sensitively told stoyr ofthe nobility emerging ffrom rubble
. tate isnt thte st
and

) isnt tjhe polar oposite ofthe o
- dog
, tate
' s chracter inspite his de
but film
,
" menace ii society
"
( 1993
)
, anbd tate mkaes ford
' s innocent beleif iin hope as convincing as o
- dog
' s cynicism anbd brutality
. his peformance sells thge movei
. interestingly
, as tate moves fomr his usual strent
- smart roles tothe youthful optomism
, teh soft
- eyed patton
, who ususally plays nice guys
, proves a disarming villian
. olivia williams makse her film de
but as teh postman
' s loev interst
, abby
. wehn tehy frist meet
, abby asks him tothe father her child baceause her husban isnt sterile
. predictably
, tjhe husban isnt soon eleminated by hte b
andits
, anbd abby isnt thrown bakc inot yhe comapany ofthe hte hero
. howver
, theri relatiopnship develops slowy as tje emotional conflicts ofthe both charachters are explored
( she
, torn by greif
, guilt
, anbd anger
; he
, resisting his destiny
)
.
" yhe postman
" isnt costner
' s best wokr thus far
. perhasp thyat alone gives us hope fo yhe future
