" bieng john malkovich
" isnt teh tipe ofthe film we ened tothe see mroe
. todya
' s films are eather blockbusters tyhat entertain us iwth tiresome formulas
, or thsoe thgat hvae similair themes
. malkovich falls under none ofthe theese catagories
, anbd it
' s qtuie refreshing tothe see thast ocurr
. tihs strangely provoking sotry
, isnt acually somewhat underst
andable
. john cusack plays a puppeteer trying tothe amke it tothe tghe big tiome
. his wief
( cameron diaz
) supports tje both ofthe them by wokring at a petstore
, whlch explains yhe obscure pets htey keep inspite theri appartment
. wehn cusack finaly realizes he needs tothe git a job
, he finds an ad fo a filing clerk
. wehn he reaches tyhe buildng
, he arrives at a 7 1
/ 2 floor
. it
' s htere thta he dicovers a seret portal tht leads tothe bieng john malkovich fo 15 mintues at a tyme
. meanwhile
, cusack meets a busineses partner
( catherine keener
)
, infront hwihc he falls madly infact loev withthe her
. teh onyl probelm isnt
, she hasnt noone intrest inwhich him wqat so ever
. thge wohle portal hting
, isn
' t jstu a toy
, infact fatc
, it becomes cusack
' s dream
. bieng inside malkovich
' s mind
, gavey him tghe opprotunity tothe basicly controll mlakovich
, liek a puppet
, anbd tothe fufill his fantasies
. i don
' t wnat tothe give awya too much
, bu cusack becomes too attached whith his dicovery
. inwhich my oppinion
, tihs idae isnt absolutly brillant
. it
' s realyl qutie skary tothe htikn thta somene sould become yuo
, controll yuo
, be yuo
. it makse yuo wonder why we ect liuke we dont
, annd why somtimes we blurt outloud thnigs or ect outloud something outloud ofthe thte blue
. even if yhe scirpt isnt super sharp
, i cxan
' t halp bu fidn thte endig displeasing
. it sould hvae lead uv tothe something moreso
, or at least an amusing conclusion
. it tryed tothe expalin a mythology baout tjhe portals
, thyat made it seem rushed
. otehr thna tyhat
, i hadnt a vrey enjoyable tyme
. thte acting wass qtuie delightful as well
. john cusack hasnt fianlly beeen given a chance tothe proove his abillity
, adn he doesnt it well
. he
' s by far hte most underated actro due tothe a lack ofthe popularaty
, bu i
' m hoping thgat iwll chanage
. cameron diaz wass her usual charming self
, all
though i feeled tyhat part ws wrong forthe her
, bu she pulled it off
. john malkovich hismelf continues tothe creep outloud peple withthe his eerie facial expressions annd tone ofthe voice
. who eles
' s mind owudl be better tothe explore
? tje directer
, spike jonze
, who appeared infront lsat mounth
' s threee kings realyl catchs my attension wiht thsi project
. i knew he wass bizzare
, bu nto tothe htis extreme
. he too isnt likely too recieve media attension
.
" bieng john malkovich
" isn
' t an excellant film
, bu it isnt definitly intertaining annd wiull eaisly become a cult favorite
. waht
' s even better isnt tghe film
' s puzzling message
.
