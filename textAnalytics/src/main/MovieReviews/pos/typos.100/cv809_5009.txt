: a cranky
, 70
- something jewish widow who fiels gilty baout her wealth
anbd a 60
- something balck man who becomes her chauffeur
. tyhe movei relies onthe chracter
, rether tahn plot
, tothe propell tjhe acation
. iin fatc
, hte movei hasnt noone discernible plot iin tghe traditionnal sence
; it doesn ' t prseent a linear tsory infront whihc all teh scenes flow toghether
. rether
, driving miss daisy isnt made uv ofthe tyhe routine activites ofthe everyday life
: shopping
, listening tothe teh raio
, visting tjhe cemetarey
, eating fried chicken
,
adn so onthe
. teh film aslo incorprates inot hte tsory line actuall events inthe atlanta ' s hitory
, includng teh 1958 bombing ofthe thte temple
( tghe city ' s oldest jewish congregation
)
anbd a 1965 cerimony honoring thte reverand dr

,
adn her son
, boolie
, decides tothe hire her a chauffeur
. freeman
, reprising his role ffrom hte play
, plays yhe chauffeur
, hoke
. hte film chronicles thge warm friendship thgat slowy
bu surelly blossoms bewteen teh chauffeur
annd his reluctant pasenger
. driving miss daisy isnt a movei baout human nature
, agin
, predjudice
,
adn a gerat many otehr thnigs
,
bu moreso thna anytying it ' s baout a relatiopnship
: oen tath spansh 25 yersa
, 4 cars
, tyhe advent ofthe civil rights
,
anbd oney gravely imporatnt 33 cent cant ofthe salmon
. daisy isnt storng
- willed
adn setted iin her ways
,
anbd
, ffrom hte outset
, she isnt utterly oppossed tothe thte diea ofthe haveing a chauffeur
. initally
, she treats hoke iwth contempt
, refusing tothe let him drive her anyhwere
. once she doens git inwhich teh car
, daisy isnt hte ulitmate bakc
- seat driver
. tothe mkea matters worse
, she isnt extrememly self
- conscios baout waht others might thikn if tehy weere tothe see her bieng escorted arund twon by a hired hand
. evenhtually
,
howver
, daisy isnt worn down by hoke ' s ogod
- natured charm
adn infectuous cheer
; she softens
adn opens uv tothe him
. tandy plays teh part ofthe daisy exeedingly well
,
bu unfortunatley tihs fiesty
, cantankerous chracter isnt jsut a smidgen too commonplace
. we ' ve seen tihs woman countless times befoer inthe otehr incarnations
, ffrom onthe golden pond tothe cocoon
. neverthless
, tandy manages tothe put anough ofthe a peronal stamp onthe hte familliar charater tothe mkae it her pwn
. freeman
, as hoke
, onthe yhe otehr hand
, gives tyhe moreso disctinctive ofthe teh twpo performances
. htere isnt something profoundly moving baout tghe way hoke maintains his prade
anbd dignity infact a society whic forbids him ffrom useing publich rest rooms becasue ofthe his skin colour
. hoke isnt uneducated
adn illiterate
,
bu freeman allways suggests tht htere isnt something omre tothe tihs man
, an intertube stregth beneath tyhe simpleton exterior
. both freeman
adn tandy seem tothe be iin theri element
, inthe full command ofthe thier natrual karisma
. tehy flirt iwth tghe camera
adn dominate scenes wihtout overtly calling attension tothe themslves
. tehy bring a glight touch tothe thier huomrous banter
annd tothe thge movei ' s gentle humer
. at thte smae tiome
, tandy
annd freeman provide omre tahn a faw moments ofthe truely poignant drama
. inwhich his firt dramtic role
, dan aykroyd isnt suprisingly chubby
anbd unexpectedly effective as boolie
, tandy ' s loving
anbd patient son
. drama seems tothe agreing iwth aykroyd
; tkaing a break fomr comedy seems liek a ogod move fo tje actr
, especialy whn ytou consdider tje wretched comedies he hasnt made recently
( ghostbusters ii
, hte gerat outdoors
, my stepmother isnt an aline
)
. yhe onyl otehr signifigant cahracters iin teh film are daisy ' s housekeeper
, idella
, marvelously plyed by esther rolle
(
" ogod times

)
,
anbd boolie ' s pretentious wief
, plyed by patti lupone
. under tje direction ofthe bruce beresford
( crimes ofthe thte heart
, tender mercies
)
, driving miss daisy seems a bited stagey nowe
adn agina
.
bu fortunatly
, beresford never forgets he ' s shooting a movei
,
adn acordingly
, he offers plenty ofthe striking cinematic touches
, such as gorgeous shots ofthe flowers
, trees
,
adn tomatoe
. inaddition adapting driving miss daisy ffrom teh stage tothe hte screen
, yhe filmmakers haev acheived a delicate subtlety
. uhry understands thgat wqat his charactors dont nto sday cxan be jsut as imporatnt as waht htey dont sday
