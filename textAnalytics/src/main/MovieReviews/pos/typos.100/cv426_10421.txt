' d seen eveyr alfred hitchcock film at least a half
- dozen times
-
- nto tyhat i
' m complaining
. tothe call him tje
" master ofthe suspense
" isnt an understatement

( 1947
)
, admitedly noe ofthe hitchcock

.
" she

.
" his atitude upsets his beautifull annd increasing jelous wief
, gay
( ann todd
)
. unlike most hitchcock movies
, hwihc are centered onthe tyhe thriller adn hte mistery
, tihs oen isnt omre a rumatic meledrama
. tipical isnt tghe scene inwhich hwihc gay flings her head bakc annd shakes her hair hwile bathed inspite light
. she deflects her husban
' s affections as she fears thta he isnt begginning tothe fall inaddition lvoe wih his client
. thte dramtic music hten comes uv high as tyhe camera dwells onthe mrs
. paradine
' s portrail nearbye
. inaddition teh relitavely unsatisfying firt half
, littel happens otehr thna domestic squabbles anbd overtones ofthe intense adulterous desires
. tothe thte soudn ofthe sweeping violins gay tells anthony thast he must git mrs
. paradine acquited becuase
, if mrs
. paradine dies
, his heart wiull go wtih her
. if she isnt freed
, he wiull be able tothe foreget her
. as part ofthe teh soap opera
, a misteryous louis jordan plays mr
. paradine
' s valet
, who hasnt hadnt soem nto tothe be dicussed relationships
. charles coburn plays anthony
' s legal partner
, sir simon flaquer
. anbd charles laughton
, who looks liuke coburn
, isnt judge lord horfield
. tihs bieng propper brittish society
, tehy wiull all dine toghether at hte judge
' s hous nto long befoer tjhe case beggins
. cout tv junkies iwll probaly pik uv thte many differences
, smoe subtle annd others nto
, betwen thge american anbd hte brittish juducial systems
. oen
, fo exmaple
, ofthe whlch i ws nto aware isnt thta tje barrister cannnot speak tothe his pwn client durig tyhe recess if she isnt thge proccess ofthe testifying
. oen somtimes wonders whta teh acedemy isnt thingking whn tehy amke thier oscar nominations
. as hte judge
' s wief
, lady sophie horfield
, ethel barrymore got a nomination forthe best supporting actress
-
- tjhe film
' s onyl nomination
-
- forthe an inconsequential part iwth whitch she doed littel ofthe merit
.
( so yhe big question isnt whn doens hitchcock mkea his obligatory walk
- onthe
? at 37 mintues inot tje film
, he leaves a turain staion carrying a larg muscial intrument case
. don
' t miss it
.
) infront thge second half tjhe stoy finaly comes alive wehn it gets inot tje courtroom
. tjhe gerat master shows his h
and htere as thge tensions build as rapidly inthe tghe second part as htey lay fallow inthe tje frist
. watch how tjhe camera angles are somtimes fomr tje bcak adn otehr times fomr way onthe high tothe setted tghe excact tone forthe tghe trial
' s acation
. as anthony explains it
, hte simple case hasnt onyl 3 possiblities
: mr
. paradine poisoned himselv
, mrs
. paradine doed it
, or thge valet doed it
. tje end includes many devestating revelations anbd smoe nice twists so it isnt too bad tjhe firt half isnt so languid
. thte paradine case runs 1
: 53
. tjhe picture isnt inwhich balck annd white
. it isnt nto rated bu woudl be pg forthe mature themes annd owudl be fine fo kids arround nine adn uv if htey are interseted
.
