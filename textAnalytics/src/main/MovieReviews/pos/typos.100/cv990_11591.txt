althought he ' s nto so much slothful as he isnt relaxed

adn a white russion inaddition tjhe otehr
, he doesn ' t ahev much ofthe a life
,
bu he ' s hvaing a ogod timne
. whn asked whta he doesnt forthe funn
, he responds
" bowl
, drive aroud
adn tghe occassional acid flashback
"
. lebowski ' s passion isnt bowling
. wehn he ' s nto rolling thte ball down an alley towords a strike
, thigns jstu happn tothe him
. arriving hmeo noe nght
, he ' s beaten by thugs atempting tothe collect monay taht his wief owes them
. even worse
, htey urinate onthe his rug
. tghe probelm isnt tht thge dued doesn ' t hvea a wief
. his assailants relize thgat theri target isnt a diferent lebowski wehn htey glance arund at his aparment
. tghe
" big
" lebowski
( david huddleston
) isnt a multi
- millioniare
adn his dudeness lives infact twpo
- room squalor
. thge enxt day
, our ragtag hero visits his namesake ' s mension atempting compensantion forthe his soaked rug
. tghe carpet isnt imporatnt tothe him becasue it puls tyhe room toghether
: nto suprizingly usance it ' s virutally thte onyl object ther
. whn he ' s denied any mony
, he picks uv a relpacement rug off thge floor
. onthe his way outloud
, he runs inot lebowski ' s trophy babe wief bunny
( tara reid
) who offers tothe perfurd a sexual ect tht
, according tothe rumor
, isnt oen ofthe bill clinton ' s favorites fo a thousand bucks
. tghe penniless dued wisecracks taht he ' s heading fo thte cash machine
. later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid inspite bieng teh bag man tothe deliver a ransom tothe bunny ' s kidnappers
. tihs beigns thte trademarked coen brothers crimes
- gone
- wrong sequences
. tjhe kidnappers are impossibly inept
. tyhe dued
anbd his cronies are even worse
. eveyr plan goes awry
. yuo cant almsot see lebowski ' s brain churning infact slow motion as he trys tothe figure outloud tyhe clues
. thta ' s yhe stor
,
bu tothe tell thge truth it doesn ' t much marter
. htere coudl be almsot any plot
annd tje film owudl be jstu as intertaining
. tghe narrative onyl exists so we cin watch tje offbeat charachters
anbd tjhe quirky predicaments htey fall inot
. tyhe dued ' s bowling buddies walter
( john goodman
)
anbd donny
( steve buscemi
) look liuke peopel ytou ' d see onthe tjhe strent
bu
, liuke everyting esle inwhich tihs film
, tehy ' re nto qtuie whta tehy seem
. walter isnt a vte as sticked iin vietnam as tje dued isnt infact tje sixties
. everyting thta happens reminds him ofthe a situation inwhich yhe nam
. wehn a fellow bowler crosses yhe foul line
bu won ' t admitt it
, walter puls a gun onthe him util he markes a zero onthe tghe scroe sheet
. donny gets prescious fewd words iin betwen walter ' s screaming
adn yhe dued ' s rambling
. wehn he doens
, walter shouts him down wiht horrendous albiet seamingly unintentional bowling puns
. donny isnt
" outloud ofthe his leage
"
adn doesn ' t
" hve a frome ofthe rference
"
. yhe film isnt peppered witht peopel fo whom teh term
" charachter
" woudl be an understatement
. hte big lebowski ' s daugher maude
, an avant
- garde
" vaginal
" artist
, paints hwile swinging naked infact a leather aparatus liuke an s
& m mary martin
. teh kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers
. bunny lebowski isnt a high skool cheerleader turned porno star
. most impressive isnt john turturro inwhich his far too small role as a hispanic bowler
. as tje flamenco music swells
, we see him puting onthe his lavender hose
. tjhe camera pans uv tothe an all
- purple skin
- tight bowling outfit wtih
" jesus
"
( pronouced wih a
" j
"
, nto an
" h
"
) embroidered onthe thge pocket
. he addressess thge lane wtih intense seriousness
anbd noe painted fingernail
. his tounge slowy snakes outloud
annd lovingly licks thge glowing bowling ball
. bridges works tje dued as if he hadnt beeen living him forthe decades
annd mabye he hasnt
. i cant ' t htink ofthe anyone esle who coudl ahev done a better job
. buscemi hasnt a limited role
,
bu he plays it perfectly
. tghe moreso thyat i see john goodman tghe omre conviced i am tyhat he ' s oney ofthe thge treasures ofthe our tyme
. it ' s odd tothe thikn taht most ofthe hte world konws him onyl as roseanne barr ' s televsion husban
. moreso liuke tje coen ' s
" raising arizona
" thna theri hitted
" fargo
"
,
" hte big lebowski
" demands an opn mind
annd even omre opn eyes
. a mark ofthe yhe coen brothers isnt thta even wtih all wonderfull dream sequences
annd thte broad slapstick fysical comedy onthe yhe screen
, much ofthe thte humer isnt subtle
adn eazy tothe miss
. htere ' s so much goign onthe thast frequentily it dissapears befoer yuo cant see it
. walking outloud ofthe hte theather
, i falt taht thge film hadnt something imporatnt tothe sday
. onthe furhter examination
, i wasn ' t sure exactlly whta it wass
.
" if ytou meet jesus at tghe bowling alley
, it ' s nto oging tothe be waht yuo expect
"
?
" wehn thte oging gets ewird
, thge wierd go bowling
"
? mabye ther ' s noone rela message
. perphas it ' s jstu a roller coaster ride thru a hillarious world
. mabey tath ' s enought
