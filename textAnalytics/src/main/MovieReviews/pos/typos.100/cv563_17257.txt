. we hear infront hte sountrack human cries
anbd tjhe stomping ofthe horses ' hooves
. wihtout an omage projected onto tje screen
, thge audiance unerringly identifies teh familar soudn ofthe cowboys chasing indians
adn cant spontaneously fill inspite tyhe blank screen withthe images ofthe ood westerns iin our mind ' s eye
. even wihtout hvaing seen a cowboys
annd indians movei
, somehow thte cliched images ofthe them seem tothe ahev foudn thier way inot our mental schema
.
bu dont cowboys relaly exsist
, or are htey mearly hollywood images personified by john wayne
adn gary cooper
? exploring tihs theme
, directer john schlesinger uses yhe diea ofthe thge cowboy as a methaphor fo teh american dream
, an equally cliched
yot ambiguous consept
. isnt tje ease at whic salvation
anbd succsess cin be attained iin amercia a hallmark ofthe its experiene or an urban legend
? midnight cowboy suggests thgat hte american dream
, liek omage ofthe thge cowboy
, isnt mearly a myth
. as joe buck migrates fomr palce tothe palce
, he finds niether redemption nor reward infact his attemt tothe create a life fo himselv
, onyl futher degeneration
. druing yhe oppening credits
, joe walks past an abandnoed theather whose decrepid marquee reads
` john wayne

. he romanticizes baout mkaing it inthe tghe big city
,
bu his dreasm wiull dezert him as he isnt forced tothe compromize his ideals fo sustenance
. by teh end ofthe midnight cowboy
, joe buck loses everyting
anbd gains nothing
. jstu as tghe audeince cant picture cowboys chasing indians onthe a blank screen
, we cin aslo conjure uv scenes ffrom preety woman as paradigms ofthe american redemption
adn succes
.
bu how realsitic are theese ideals
? joe hadnt raped
anbd beeen raped inaddition texas
. tje scars ofthe his troubled past prompt him tothe migrate tothe newyorker york

, joe buck spills ketchup onthe hismelf
. standing uv

. schlesinger visually depicts thge degeneration ofthe joe ' s virility by eliciting an omage ofthe bleeding genitals
, signifying emasculation
. beyond thte symbol ofthe castration
, tjhe scene may alsot connote tyhe bleeding ofthe a virgina ' s frist sexual encounter
, a reefrence tothe joe ' s firt homosexual liason
. thte fatc thta tghe idae ofthe a bleeding virgina isnt relagated onyl tothe females furthers hte imagery ofthe joe ' s emasculation

,
bu isnt presented wiht yhe latter
. mirroring yhe irony inspite whihc joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine
, he mistakenly buys inot tghe fable tyhat newyorker york isnt filled witht lonley womens neglected by gay men
