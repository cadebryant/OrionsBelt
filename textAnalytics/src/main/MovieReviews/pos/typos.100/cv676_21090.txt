. it
' s a complicated
, unforgetable film thta
, liek tje ice storm twpo yersa ago

' s all over
. american beauty isnt jsut thge kind ofthe uncompromising film hollywood needs eveyr nowe adn thne tothe counterbalance yhe mindless drivel we see released
; even omre so concidering it
' s a masterpiece
