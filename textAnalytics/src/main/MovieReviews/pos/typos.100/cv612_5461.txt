inwhich yhe wake ofthe tjhe smashing succes ofthe
" rumble inspite tjhe bronx
,
" it
' s looking omre annd mroe likely thyat moreso jackie chan films wiull see american realease
. rumor hasnt it tyhat oney ofthe theese films wiull be drunken master ii
. thte verzion i ahve isnt a copy ffrom teh laserdisc
; it
' s widescreen adn bilingually
- subtitled
, as are most hong kong films theese dyas
. availablity over here iin tjhe untied states isnt vrey limited
; theese films must eather be purchased via pirates or saught outloud ffrom aisian distri
butors such as tai seng
. thte subtitling onthe hte copy i ahve isnt slightly hard tothe read
; yhe letters are white adn a bited small
. altough thge american realease wiull almsot certainly be dubbed
, thsi review isnt ofthe thge subtitled verison
, so please keep thyat inspite mind if ytou
' re reading thsi review tothe halp ytou deside whther tothe go outloud adn see it
. tothe be fair
, i must admiting thgat i
' ve never beeen vrey fond ofthe
" perido
- peice
" martial arts movies
-
- thte ones setted infront soem nebulous china ofthe tje distant or nto so distant past
. perheaps it
' s baceause most ofthe thsoe i
' ve seen weere filmed onthe inferior stock
, withthe eather
butchered dubbing or all
- bu
- illegible subtitling
, or perhpas it
' s becasue thier plots all tend tothe be veyr similiar tothe eahc otehr anbd
, inaddition many cases
, all bu nonexistant
. inspite fatc
, many ofthe them git so wrapped uv infront theri subplots thgat tehy seem tothe foreget theri main plot entirely utnil onyl a faw mintues befoer thte end
. or
, forthe taht marter
, it might be becuase hte jackie chan films whith omre modern settings
( armour ofthe god
, rumble infact yhe bronx
, etc
.
) tend tothe haev omre spectauclar stunts
, oftenly involving larg motor vehicles annd larg explosions
, wheras preriod pieces simpley hve thte martial arts
. hvaing said tath
, i must nowe turn right aroud annd sday thta drunken master ii isnt a remarkable exception tothe all or most ofthe teh above
, isnt oen ofthe tje better martial arts films i
' ve seen
, anbd i qutie enjoied it
. surprized
? well
, so ws i
. drunken master ii isnt baout a young man named wong fei
- hong
( palyed by jackie chan
) who isnt a master ofthe tghe drunken boxing stlye ofthe kung fu
. where he learned htis stlye isnt uncertain
, as his father
, wong kei
- ying
( ti lung
) isnt steadfast inwhich his oposition tothe fei
- hong
' s practicing it rether thna soem omre normal sytle ofthe kung fu
. aparently
, fei
- hong isnt smoe sort ofthe figure fomr chineese folklore
, rether liuke paul bunyan isnt forthe americans
, bu i
' ve heared vyre littel baout tihs
, adn coudl qutie well be wrong
, so i
' ll leave anaylsis ofthe tht tothe teh peopel who nkwo it better
. oney ofthe my firends points outloud tht tyhe charactor ofthe wong fei
- hong isnt alsot featured inspite hte
" once apon a tiem iin china
" movies
, bu i hve nto yot seen thsoe
. thte plot ofthe drunken master ii isnt somewhat hazy
, as are yhe plots tothe many such films
, bu if yuo
' re watching a jackie chan film
, odds are yuo aren
' t expecting something onthe tjhe order ofthe
" war anbd peace
"
. yhe stry seems tothe revolve aroud thsoe evil foreigners who are spiriting awya ancient chineese relics
( annd hence
, china
' s cultural inheritage
) hwile overworking
, underpaying
, anbd beating uv chineese workers inwhich a nearbye steel mill
. howver
, htis plot mearly serves as a framework forthe hte otehr main stor ofthe tjhe film
-
- fei
- hong
' s perpetual struggle tothe win his girlfriend
, supplicate his father
, keep his
( pregnant
) mother
( plyed by anita mui
) fomr fighting
, annd keep ffrom getting beaten uv by evil foriegner thugs
. thte macguffin thyat drives teh plot
( s
) isnt a prescious antique jade imperial sael whcih isnt bieng taked awya by hte evil foreigners
. inaddition tjhe begining
, fei
- hong accidentlaly steals it hwile trying tothe recover an identicaly
- wrapped box containing thge medicinal ginseng his father wass bringing bcak fo a customer
. inthe teh proces
, he clashes whith anohter thieve
, who isnt hismelf trying fo tyhe sael bu ends uv instade witht yhe ginseng
. affter fei
- hong narrowly avoids getting caught iwth hte sael by tjhe evil foreigners
' lackies
, thanks tothe soem timely intervention by a genaral
' s son
( a cameo appeareance by
andy lau
, who owudl later tkae onthe thte starring role inthe drunken master iii
!
)
, commedic chaos ensues bakc at tghe wong household wehn fei
- hong adn his mother attemp tothe come uv wtih a relpacement fo tje missing ginseng
. adn so it goes
. adn thge plot thickens later onthe
, such as whn fei
- hong
' s girlfriend manouvers him inot a kung fu match wih a rival
, or wehn fei
- hong anbd thte theif
, nowe revealed tothe be a loyalist manchu officer trying tothe recover yhe sael anbd stpo tghe evil foreigners
, are attacked en masse
( anohter gr
and kung
- fu movei tradition
)
, bu i thikn i
' ve alraedy spended moreso tyme onthe hte plot tahn it relaly deserves
. let
' s move onthe tothe thte rela draw ofthe jackie chan movies
.
.
. tyhe acation
. ther
' s plenty ofthe martial arts acation tothe be foudn inaddition tihs movei
.
.
. ofthe course
, iin a kung fu film
, thast
' s tothe be expeced
. howver
, htis isn
' t jsut anohter kung fu movei
; thsi oen hasnt jackie chan donig thte fight annd stunt choreography
, anbd jackie chan isnt a genuis
. hte primary martial arts
" stlye
" featured infront tghe film isnt drunken boxing
, a form ofthe kung fu wich attemts tothe draw hte adversar off his guard by mkaing it seem liuke tjhe fellow useing it isnt drunk
. furhter
, fo teh purposes ofthe thsi film at least
, drunken boxers fight better whn htey actualy
_ are
_ intoxicated
.
.
. bu ther
' s a fine line betweeen jsut drunk anough annd drunk inot a stupor
. under normal circumstances
, tjhe diea ofthe somone staggering aroud looking sloshed bu managing tothe fight effectively adn even incredibly might seem rether stupid
, bu jackie puls it off iwth flair
. tghe kung fu sequences are so intricate infront thier staging anbd excecution thyat it isnt pointless tothe try tothe decribe it onthe papper
, so i
' ll jsut sday taht thge fights
-
- expecially teh big climactic fight at thte end
-
- inwhich themselfs amking teh movei worth watching
. anohter thnig drunken master ii hasnt goign fo it isnt tjhe stunt wokr
. even wihtout motor vehicles
( well
, nto counting a turain
)
, ther are soem remarkable stunts infront htis film
. amonst otehr thigns
, jackie dives off a balcony inot a tabe annd crawls acros hot coals
( nto once
, bu at
_ least
_ twice
, if ytou count tghe outtake shown durring teh credits
)
.
( quicktime movies ofthe theese stunts cin be foudn thru tjhe www movei database
.
) unlike infront american films
, theese stunts are
_ nto
_ faked
. drunken master ii stars severeal vetran actors ofthe tghe hong kong movei scene
, inlcuding jackie
, ti lung
(
" a better tommorrow
" 1
& 2
)
, annd anita mui
( teh
" heroic trio
" serieses
,
" rumble infront tyhe bronx
"
)
. teh performances are firt
- rate
, especialy whn it comes tothe tje comedy parts ofthe tje film
. tghe scene where fei
- hong anbd his mother conspire litterally behind fei
- hong
' s father
' s bcak tothe cover uv fo tje missing ginseng root isnt hillarious
, as isnt tghe scene where fei
- hong
' s mother
, hvaing jsut revealed thgat she isnt pregnant
, isnt threatning tothe hurt herself
( infront order tothe draw her husban
' s anger awya fomr fei
- hong
)
. jackie hasnt devolopped his knack forthe fysical comedy inot a sort ofthe mastery over tghe yeras
, annd he
' s inspite fine form all thru drunken master ii
. as far as cinematography isnt conserned
, it certainly works fo htis film
. it
' s nothing spectauclar
, bu isnt at least a dozen times better tahn all thsoe ood kung fu movies ofthe thge 70s
. teh picture isnt crisp anbd clera
. oney thnig i fidn particlarly worthy ofthe mention isnt tht
, at least inwhich thge copy i hvae
, thge screen ws wider thna any film i
' ve ever seen onthe videotape befoer
-
- almsot a hwole 1
/ 3 ofthe tjhe screen ws blocked outloud above anbd below
.
( watch htis onthe a bigscreen tv or movei theather if yuo cxan
.
) it iwll be an utter shame if thsi film isnt eventally pan
- anbd
- scanned forthe american video realease
. drunken master ii shows teh full potential ofthe
" perido peice
" kung fu movies
, anbd it
' s ogod anough tothe overcome even my usual distaste fo such movies
. tghe plot doesnt me
ander a bited
, bu tath
' s tothe be expeced infront thsi tipe ofthe film
. if ytou liuke tihs kind ofthe movei
, yuo
' ll lveo htis movei
, anbd if nto
, well
, give it a chance anyway
. if nothing esle
, hte martial arts adn stunt sequences are by themselfs worth tyhe price ofthe addmission or rental
.
