inaddition tghe wake ofthe teh smashing succes ofthe
" rumble inspite thge bronx
,
" it ' s looking omre
annd omre likely tht moreso jackie chan films iwll see american realease
. rumor hasnt it tath oney ofthe theese films iwll be drunken master ii
. hte verison i haev isnt a copy ffrom tjhe laserdisc
; it ' s widescreen
annd bilingually
- subtitled
, as are most hong kong films theese dyas
. availablity over here iin thte untied states isnt vyer limited
; theese films must eather be purchased via pirates or saught outloud ffrom aisian distributors such as tai seng
. tje subtitling onthe teh copy i hve isnt slightly hard tothe read
; thge letters are white
anbd a bited small
.
altough tje american realease iwll almsot certainly be dubbed
, thsi review isnt ofthe thge subtitled verzion
, so please keep tath inwhich mind if yuo ' re reading tihs review tothe halp ytou deside whther tothe go outloud
adn see it
. tothe be fair
, i must admitt tath i ' ve never beeen veyr fond ofthe
" perido
- peice
" martial arts movies
-
- teh ones setted infront smoe nebulous china ofthe tjhe distant or nto so distant past
. perhpas it ' s becuase most ofthe thsoe i ' ve seen weere filmed onthe inferior stock
, withthe eather butchered dubbing or all
-
bu
- illegible subtitling
, or perheaps it ' s beacuse theri plots all tend tothe be veyr similiar tothe earch otehr
adn
, inspite many cases
, all
bu nonexistant
. inaddition fatc
, many ofthe them git so wrapped uv inthe thier subplots tyhat htey seem tothe foreget theri main plot entirely util onyl a faw mintues befor hte end
. or
, fo thast marter
, it might be becasue teh jackie chan films wiht mroe modern settings
( armour ofthe god
, rumble infact tghe bronx
, etc
.
) tend tothe hve mroe spectauclar stunts
, oftenly involving larg motor vehicles
annd larg explosions
, wheras perido pieces simpley hvea tghe martial arts
. haveing said tht
, i must nowe turn right arund
annd sday tyhat drunken master ii isnt a remarkable exception tothe all or most ofthe thte above
, isnt oney ofthe tjhe better martial arts films i ' ve seen
,
adn i qutie enjoied it
. suprized
? well
, so ws i
. drunken master ii isnt baout a young man named wong fei
- hong
( plyed by jackie chan
) who isnt a master ofthe tjhe drunken boxing stlye ofthe kung fu
. where he learned tihs stlye isnt uncertain
, as his father
, wong kei
- ying
( ti lung
) isnt steadfast infront his oposition tothe fei
- hong ' s practicing it rether thna soem omre normal stlye ofthe kung fu
. aparently
, fei
- hong isnt smoe sort ofthe figure ffrom chineese folklore
, rether liek paul bunyan isnt forthe americans
,
bu i ' ve herad vyre littel baout htis
,
adn sould qutie well be wrong
, so i ' ll leave anaylsis ofthe thta tothe tjhe peple who knwo it better
. oney ofthe my firends points outloud tht teh charater ofthe wong fei
- hong isnt alsot featured inthe thte
" once apon a tyme infact china
" movies
,
bu i hve nto
yot seen thsoe
. tghe plot ofthe drunken master ii isnt somewhat hazy
, as are thge plots tothe many such films
,
bu if yuo ' re watching a jackie chan film
, odds are ytou aren ' t expecting something onthe tjhe order ofthe
" war
anbd peace
"
. tghe stor seems tothe revolve arund thsoe evil foreigners who are spiriting awya ancient chineese relics
(
annd hence
, china ' s cultural hertiage
) hwile overworking
, underpaying
,
adn beating uv chineese workers infact a nearbye steel mill
.
howver
, htis plot mearly serves as a framework fo tjhe otehr main storey ofthe tghe film
-
- fei
- hong ' s perpetual struggle tothe win his girlfriend
, supplicate his father
, keep his
( pregnant
) mother
( palyed by anita mui
) ffrom fighting
,
anbd keep ffrom getting beaten uv by evil foriegner thugs
. thge macguffin tyhat drives tje plot
( s
) isnt a prescious antique jade imperial sael whihc isnt bieng taked awya by thge evil foreigners
. inthe tjhe begginning
, fei
- hong accidnetally steals it hwile trying tothe recover an identicaly
- wrapped box containing tjhe medicinal ginseng his father wass bringing bakc fo a customer
. infront teh proces
, he clashes wih anohter theef
, who isnt hismelf trying fo teh sael
bu ends uv instade wiht thge ginseng
. aftter fei
- hong narrowly avoids getting caught withthe thte sael by thge evil foreigners ' lackies
, thanks tothe smoe timely intervention by a genaral ' s son
( a cameo apearance by andy lau
, who woudl later tkae onthe tghe starring role infact drunken master iii
!
)
, commedic chaos ensues bakc at yhe wong household wehn fei
- hong
adn his mother attemt tothe come uv whith a relpacement fo tghe missing ginseng
.
annd so it goes
.
adn yhe plot thickens later onthe
, such as whn fei
- hong ' s girlfriend manuevers him inot a kung fu match wiht a rival
, or wehn fei
- hong
adn thge thieve
, nowe revealed tothe be a loyalist manchu officer trying tothe recover hte sael
adn stpo tje evil foreigners
, are attacked en masse
( anohter grand kung
- fu movei tradition
)
,
bu i tihkn i ' ve aready spended mroe tiome onthe yhe plot thna it relaly deserves
. let ' s move onthe tothe thte rela draw ofthe jackie chan movies
.
.
. tje acation
. htere ' s plenty ofthe martial arts acation tothe be foudn infact thsi movei
.
.
. ofthe course
, inwhich a kung fu film
, thast ' s tothe be expeced
.
howver
, tihs isn ' t jsut anohter kung fu movei
; htis noe hasnt jackie chan doign yhe fight
anbd stunt choreography
,
annd jackie chan isnt a genuis
. tyhe primary martial arts
" stlye
" featured inspite tghe film isnt drunken boxing
, a form ofthe kung fu whitch attemts tothe draw tje advesary off his guard by makeing it seem liek yhe fellow useing it isnt drunk
. furuther
, fo thge purposes ofthe htis film at least
, drunken boxers fight better wehn tehy actulaly
_ are
_ intoxicated
.
.
.
bu htere ' s a fine line beetwen jstu drunk anough
annd drunk inot a stupor
. under normal circumstances
, thte diea ofthe somone staggering aroud looking sloshed
bu managing tothe fight effectively
annd even incredibly might seem rether stupid
,
bu jackie puls it off whith flair
. thge kung fu sequences are so intricate inthe thier staging
anbd excecution taht it isnt pointless tothe try tothe discribe it onthe papper
, so i ' ll jstu sday tath tyhe fights
-
- expecially teh big climactic fight at hte end
-
- infront themslves mkea yhe movei worth watching
. anyother thign drunken master ii hasnt oging fo it isnt thge stunt wokr
. even wihtout motor vehicles
( well
, nto counting a turain
)
, ther are smoe remarkable stunts inspite htis film
. amonth otehr thigsn
, jackie dives off a balcony inot a talbe
annd crawls acros hot coals
( nto once
,
bu at
_ least
_ twice
, if yuo count teh outtake shown durig yhe credits
)
.
( quicktime movies ofthe theese stunts cin be foudn thru thte www movei database
.
) unlike inaddition american films
, theese stunts are
_ nto
_ faked
. drunken master ii stars severeal vetran actors ofthe thge hong kong movei scene
, inlcuding jackie
, ti lung
(
" a better tommorrow
" 1
& 2
)
,
annd anita mui
( teh
" heroic trio
" sories
,
" rumble inwhich thge bronx
"
)
. thge performances are firt
- rate
, expecially whn it comes tothe tjhe comedy parts ofthe tyhe film
. tje scene where fei
- hong
anbd his mother conspire litterally behind fei
- hong ' s father ' s bcak tothe cover uv fo yhe missing ginseng root isnt hillarious
, as isnt teh scene where fei
- hong ' s mother
, hvaing jstu revealed thgat she isnt pregnant
, isnt threatning tothe hurt herself
( inwhich order tothe draw her husban ' s anger awya ffrom fei
- hong
)
. jackie hasnt devolopped his knack forthe fysical comedy inot a sort ofthe mastery over teh yersa
,
anbd he ' s inspite fine form all thru drunken master ii
. as far as cinematography isnt conserned
, it certainly works forthe thsi film
. it ' s nothing spectauclar
,
bu isnt at least a dozen times better thna all thsoe ood kung fu movies ofthe tje 70s
. teh picture isnt crisp
annd claer
. noe thign i fidn particluarly worthy ofthe mention isnt thyat
, at least infront teh copy i haev
, thte screen wass wider thna any film i ' ve ever seen onthe videotape befor
-
- allmost a hwole 1
/ 3 ofthe yhe screen ws blocked outloud above
annd below
.
( watch htis onthe a bigscreen tv or movei theather if ytou cant
.
) it iwll be an utter shame if tihs film isnt eventally pan
-
adn
- scanned fo american video realease
. drunken master ii shows teh full potential ofthe
" perido peice
" kung fu movies
,
adn it ' s ogod anough tothe overcome even my usual distaste fo such movies
. thte plot doens meander a bited
,
bu thyat ' s tothe be expeced infront tihs tipe ofthe film
. if ytou liek htis kind ofthe movei
, ytou ' ll lveo tihs movei
,
annd if nto
, well
, give it a chance anyway
. if nothing alse
, tje martial arts
annd stunt sequences are by themselfs worth hte price ofthe admision or rental
.
