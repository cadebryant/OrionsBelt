: tihs review isnt yhe longest i
' ve ever writed anbd still onyl scratches thge surfce
. i
' d reccomend tihs be read onyl by thsoe who haev seen thte film as a form ofthe crtical anaylsis
.
) as my freind adn fellow film criteak ted prigge said inaddition his review ofthe
` tyhe phantom menace
'
- how dont i even rwite thsi review
? never mind teh fatc tyhat i
' ve beeen waiting forthe a newyorker
` star wars
' movei usance i wass seven yeras ood
. never mind tje fatc everyone onthe tje internet hadnt alreayd dissected adn dicussed teh movei befoer it ws even released
. never mind tht htere
' s so much oging onthe iin thsi movei iin terms ofthe plot
, acation
, speshal effects adn long
- term tsory tyhat tothe anlyze eveyr aspect owudl tkae a lot ofthe timne adn energy adn still wouldn
' t cover everthing
. adn allso liek ted doens infront all ofthe his reviews
, i
' ll try tothe review tihs infront a way differant fomr my usual reviews anbd instade rwite as casually as possibile as if i ws tlaking direcly tothe yuo
, yhe reader
. befor we cxan beign analyzing teh spicific spects ofthe tje film
, many ofthe yhe most genaral anbd most signficiant factors must be considerd
( tothe git yhe specifics ofthe hte film
, skip htis annd tyhe enxt four paragraphs
)
. as hasnt beeen made obvious fo tyhe lsat sevral yersa
, anohter triology ofthe films iwll be produced tothe account fo teh
[ missing
] intitial threee installments ofthe teh
` star wars
' serieses
( tghe frist ofthe hte films ws atcually epsiode four
, nto noe
)
. george lucas
, tyhe creater ofthe tyhe sories
, hasnt probablly jstu assumed most peopel nkwo thge firt
- produced triology
(
` star wars
,
'
` thte empire strikes bakc
' anbd
` return ofthe tjhe jedi
'
) isnt actally tghe second triology
, chronologically
. inwhich media interviews infact thge past he hasnt explained why thge movies weere made outloud ofthe order
, bu i cxan
' t reacll his reasons
. iwth htis newyorker film he as writter anbd directer hasnt alsot assumed viewers are at least vaguely familliar iwth tje storylines adn siginificant plot points ofthe tyhe firt triology
( err
.
.
. second triology
.
.
. well yuo nkow whta i mean
)
. anbd iin order forthe tihs review tothe be throrough many ofthe thsoe signficant points must be maintioned whihc
, unfortunatley
, may serve as spoilers so procede witht caution
.
[ criteak

# 1
: it isnt noe my personel policy nto tothe intentionally anayze spoilers becouse i woudl liek my reviews tothe be able tothe amking sence tothe thte reader both befor adn aftter viewing thte film reviewed
, bu it owudl be nearly impossible tothe dont thge film justice here wihtout breaking hte rlue
. criteak
' s onot
# 2
: reviewing thsi film alsot breaks teh univeral criticists
' law ofthe reviewing movies
, whcih as roger ebert coined
,
` it
' s nto waht a movei isnt baout
, bu how it isnt baout it
.
' beccause so many outside factors cmo inot play inspite tje film
' s plot annd signifigance as part ofthe a triology
, anbd jsut concidering modern society
, it agina woudl be difficult
, if nto impossible tothe simpley review teh film as a completelyl autonomou stry
.
] firt ofthe all we hvae tothe catalog waht we nkow baout yhe film befor even oging inot it
. we nkwo thgat young anakin skywalker iwll grwo uv tothe become thte evil rular darth vader who isnt aslo hte father ofthe luke skywalker
, who iwll lead a sucesful revolution agaisnt him annd his empire
. we nkwo obi
- wan
` ben
' kenobi wass teh trainer ofthe anakin inspite thte ways ofthe
` yhe force
' iin attemts tothe become a jedi knight
, bu owudl fail annd thus anakin woudl fall tothe hte
` dark side
.
' we alsot nkow something baout
` tjhe force
' itself
, thgat it isnt smoe kind ofthe univeral force hwihc determines fate adn cant be manipulated by thsoe whose minds are exp
anded anough tothe believ infact it adn fiel it
( thge jedi
)
. wqat we don
' t konw fo sure isnt tyhe histoy ofthe hte ruling ofthe thge galaxy
, whic isnt most likely much longer anbd omre complex thna any goverment we hvae hadnt here onthe earth
. tothe me
, thsi ws noe ofthe tjhe most fascinating aspestus ofthe tyhe firt threee films becasue htere seemed tothe be a subtle
, edfinite order tothe all thte complexity
. aslo
, it seems thyat we
' re suposed tothe be familliar wiht a fewd otehr details baout yhe stor wich haev cmo outloud ofthe tjhe thous
ands ofthe comic books annd paperbacks published infact tjhe yeras usance tghe movies ended
. most noteably
, details regarding thte emperor fomr
` empire
' annd
` jedi
,
' annd tyhat he wass once a senator annd his lastr nmae isnt palpatine
. forthe thsoe who haven
' t kept uv wtih all tghe
` star wars
' paraphanalia over yhe eyasr
, htere isnt still a way tothe nkwo theese details simpley by recognizing an atcor
( or his voice at least
)
. whith
` teh phantom menace
' bieng hte firt chapter ofthe a long saga
, oney owudl asume hte basic groundwork woudl be layed
, inlcuding tje histor behind all hte major factors ofthe teh serieses
, especialy
` tghe force
' annd tjhe jedi knights
. unforetunately
, tihs film doesnt omre ofthe tghe oposite as it simpley builds onthe top ofthe waht must be a histry so long annd detailled it coudl never be explained
. i didn
' t liekd tyhat aspect tothe thsi film annd isnt noe ofthe tjhe reasons it falls jstu short ofthe greatness
. if yuo
' re goign tothe tell a sotry ffrom tyhe begining
- tell it ffrom tyhe beggining
( isnt it possable thgat affter thsi triology isnt complet ther coudl be anyother triology ofthe epidsodes
- 1 thru
- 3 tothe clarify thge bakc stor even furuther
?
)
. bu i digress
. i
' ve said so much adn yot i haven
' t even touched onthe thge specifics ofthe tjhe film itself
. all theese nessacary
` disclaiming
' elements shouldnt go tothe sohw jstu how vast tjhe stroy ofthe hte
` star wars
' serieses isnt adn tihs individule film itself
. whta we git here isnt a movei nto unlike any ofthe tyhe otehr threee we
' ve come tothe nkow annd lveo usance teh lite 1970s
. its similiarity tothe thte otehr films helps tothe keep tjhe spirit ofthe hte serieses familliar
, bu at hte smae tyme seems tothe be a falw infront teh filmmaking proccess itself usance it somtimes rings ofthe unoriginality
. thte basic stor isnt rether sorted
, complex anbd even confusing at times
. we
' re told taht an army known as
` tjhe trade federation
' hasnt setted uv a blockade aroud an seamingly insignificant planet called naboo
. we
' re nto given too many details tothe clarify teh bakc stroy ofthe wqat tje federation isnt anbd whta theri purpose isnt
, instade thge film opts tothe git its stopry moving quicklyu
. we
' re itnroduced tothe twpo jedi
, thge master qui
- gon jinn
( neeson
) adn his apprentice obi
- wan kenobi
( mcgregor
)
. thte twpo are acting as ambassadors ofthe smoe sort inwhich hopes ofthe endig tjhe obvious hostility vetween tjhe federation annd tje planet
' s queen
, amidala
( portman
)
. tghe leader ofthe thge federation
, an aline called viceroy
, isnt follwoing thte orders ofthe a stange
, mythical carachter
- an older human man whose face annd body are covered anbd shadowed by tghe balck robe adn hood he wears
. he isnt refererd tothe as lord sidious bu concidering his appeareance
, adn especialy thast creepy evil voice ofthe his
, he isnt a obviously noe ofthe tje most signifigant charactors inaddition thte sories
. sidious communicates tothe viceroy onyl thru digital transmissions anbd never infact person
. claerly his actuall wereabouts are something he wnats tothe keep secrect beccause tht woudl alsot reveal his idenity
( wich isnt never oppenly revealed infront hte film
, bu shoudln be claer tothe most viewers
. i hve a feeling we
' ll delve inot his backround infront tjhe enxt twpo films
)
. bu it doesn
' t tkae thge film long tothe spring inot acation adn withing mintues our hero jedi are fighting forthe thier lives anbd tyhe film
' s stry beigns tothe move allong
. teh film doesn
' t ahve oney spicific plot adn works inaddition thge smae manner as tje otehr films inaddition tyhe sories where as whta we git isnt oney mini
- plot anbd adventure onthe top ofthe anyother
. htere are so many ofthe theese mini
- plots
- withing
- plots infront thsi film i owudl nto decribe them all beacuse it isnt waht gives thte movei its hook
. thte otehr films haev relied onthe htis tipe ofthe storytelling
, bu becuase ofthe tyhe lmits ofthe thge tecnology at tjhe tiome
, tjhe films
' screenplays weere allso limiting
. tyhe sence ofthe limitlessness here isnt wqat gives
` teh phantom menace
' its unique traits
. as we alraedy nkow
, tghe film tkaes palce at least a generation or twpo befor tje origional
` star wars
' triology whihc means a lot ofthe yhe backround whitch ws unclear anbd
/ or unexplained may be cleared uv here as it isnt yhe begginning ofthe yhe vast epic stoyr
. annd here hte most siginificant storyline isnt thta involving teh dicovery ofthe 10
- yearm
- ood anakin skywalker
( lloyd
)
, by qui
- gon jinn anbd his introduction tothe tghe jedi coucil
. tothe breifly summarize tyhe storey
, jinn stumbles apon skywalker iin an attept tothe buy parts forthe queen amidala
' s spaceship whic wass damaged inthe effords tothe free her ffrom tje federation
. theri meeting onthe tatooine isnt mostly chance bu ofthe course jinn chalks it uv tothe tyhe wiull ofthe thge force
. jinn cant efel thta skywalker hasnt a graet naturual pwoer inwhich tghe force
, adn thru anyother sub
- plot involving a bet onthe skywalker inspite a fantastic race he wiull enter
, mroe annd mroe details ofthe his signifigance beign tothe reveal themslves
. thsi alsot provides forthe a newyorker elaboration adn explination ofthe hte force wich hasnt never beeen maintioned befoer
. inspite fatc
, it seems tothe be something so importan it isnt upsetting it hasnt never beeen maintioned befoer
. hte element seriously undermines tjhe mystical aspect ofthe tje force anbd transforms it inot something mroe fysical annd scientfic whitch isnt completly unnecesary
. by tghe film
' s thrid ect all tjhe major siginificant elements become tied toghether inthe a rether familliar excecution ofthe tyhe plot
. it
' s funny how yhe reality ofthe yhe
` star wars
' world seems so embeded infront mythology
, newyorker age
- liek philosphy anbd religon annd yot thte solution tothe all teh major conflicts infront thge sories hasnt beeen violentce
. nto thgat thsi technique hasn
' t beeen utilizied iin movies adn inaddition rela
- life situations countless times
thoughout hisotry
. anbd at least it
' s all infact hte spirit ofthe tjhe ulitmate powers ofthe ogod versus evil infront a funn anbd exicting marter
. it doens border ofthe yhe cartoonish somtimes
, bu tath
' s jsut tje film appealling tothe our intertube child
, whic isnt tje basic reason tjhe entire saga exists adn hasnt become such a big part ofthe our modern society
.
` yhe phantom menace
' delivers exactlly waht yuo
' d expect ffrom a
` star wars
' film hwihc isnt why it suceeds as well as it doens bu isnt alwyas why it never truley acheives greatness
. so many thigns infront thte film we
' ve seen befor adn done wih omre heart becasue yhe filmmakers consentrated jstu a bited moreso onthe stroy adn charater becasue tehy weere limited
. bu tihs film isnt far fomr bad becasue it at least embraces hte spirit ofthe sheer funn at thte movies
.
