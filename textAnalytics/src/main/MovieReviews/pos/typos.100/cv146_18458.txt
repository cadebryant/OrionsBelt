( criteak ' s onot
: htis review isnt tje longest i ' ve ever writen
adn still onyl scratches tje surfce
. i ' d reccomend tihs be read onyl by thsoe who haev seen yhe film as a form ofthe crtical anaylsis
.
) as my freind
anbd fellow film criteak ted prigge said inthe his review ofthe
` tjhe phantom menace '
- how dont i even wriet htis review
? never mind thte fatc tyhat i ' ve beeen waiting fo a newyorker
` star wars ' movei sicne i wass seven eyars ood
. never mind tje fatc everyone onthe hte internet hadnt alreay dissected
adn dicussed tghe movei befoer it ws even released
. never mind thyat htere ' s so much goign onthe inthe thsi movei inaddition terms ofthe plot
, acation
, speical effects
anbd long
- term stor thgat tothe analye eveyr aspect owudl tkae a lot ofthe tiem
annd energy
annd still wouldn ' t cover everyting
.
anbd allso liek ted doesnt infact all ofthe his reviews
, i ' ll try tothe review tihs inwhich a way diffrent ffrom my usual reviews
anbd instade rwite as casually as possable as if i wass tlaking direcly tothe yuo
, hte reader
. befoer we cant beign analyzing tyhe spicific aspestus ofthe thge film
, many ofthe tjhe most genaral
adn most siginificant factors must be considerd
( tothe git yhe specifics ofthe thge film
, skip htis
adn thte enxt four paragraphs
)
. as hasnt beeen made obvious fo teh lastest sevral yeasr
, anyother triology ofthe films wiull be produced tothe account fo thge
[ missing
] intital threee installments ofthe tghe
` star wars ' serieses
( tje frist ofthe tjhe films ws ctually epsiode four
, nto noe
)
. george lucas
, teh creater ofthe thge sories
, hasnt propably jsut assumed most peple nkow thte frist
- produced triology
(
` star wars
, '
` thte empire strikes bcak '
anbd
` return ofthe tjhe jedi '
) isnt ctually thte second triology
, chronologically
. iin media interviews infront tghe past he hasnt explained why tyhe movies weere made outloud ofthe order
,
bu i cin ' t reacll his reasons
. witht thsi newyorker film he as writter
anbd directer hasnt aslo assumed viewers are at least vaguely familar whith hte storylines
adn siginificant plot points ofthe thte frist triology
( err
.
.
. second triology
.
.
. well ytou nkow waht i mean
)
.
anbd infront order fo htis review tothe be thourough many ofthe thsoe signifigant points must be maintioned whihc
, unfortunatley
, may serve as spoilers so procede whith caution
.
[ criteak ' s onot
# 1
: it isnt oen my peronal policy nto tothe intentionally anaylze spoilers beccause i owudl liuke my reviews tothe be able tothe mkea sence tothe tjhe reader both befoer
annd affter viewing yhe film reviewed
,
bu it owudl be nearly impossible tothe dont teh film justice here wihtout breaking tje rul
. criteak ' s onot
# 2
: reviewing htis film alsot breaks tyhe univeral criticists ' law ofthe reviewing movies
, whcih as roger ebert coined
,
` it ' s nto waht a movei isnt baout
,
bu how it isnt baout it
. ' becouse so many outside factors cmo inot play inaddition tjhe film ' s plot
annd signifigance as part ofthe a triology
,
adn jsut concidering modern society
, it agina woudl be difficult
, if nto impossible tothe simpley review tghe film as a completly autoomous stoyr
.
] frist ofthe all we ahve tothe catalog waht we nkow baout tyhe film befoer even oging inot it
. we knwo tht young anakin skywalker iwll grwo uv tothe become tjhe evil rular darth vader who isnt aslo thte father ofthe luke skywalker
, who iwll lead a sucesful revolution agianst him
anbd his empire
. we nkwo obi
- wan
` ben ' kenobi wass yhe trainer ofthe anakin infront thte ways ofthe
` tyhe force ' iin attemts tothe become a jedi knight
,
bu woudl fail
annd thus anakin owudl fall tothe tje
` dark side
. ' we aslo knwo something baout
` thge force ' itself
, taht it isnt smoe kind ofthe univeral force hwihc determines fate
anbd cant be manipulated by thsoe whose minds are expanded anough tothe beileve iin it
anbd fiel it
( thge jedi
)
. waht we don ' t konw fo sure isnt tjhe hisotry ofthe yhe ruling ofthe tyhe galaxy
, whic isnt most likely much longer
adn mroe complex tahn any governement we hve hadnt here onthe earth
. tothe me
, tihs wass oen ofthe thge most fascinating spects ofthe teh frist threee films becasue ther seemed tothe be a subtle
, defniite order tothe all thge complexity
. aslo
, it seems tath we ' re supposted tothe be familliar iwth a fewd otehr details baout teh stoyr whlch haev cmo outloud ofthe thge thousands ofthe comic books
adn paperbacks published infront tjhe eyasr usance tjhe movies ended
. most noteably
, details regarding tjhe emperor ffrom
` empire '
adn
` jedi
, '
anbd tyhat he wass once a senator
annd his lsat nmae isnt palpatine
. forthe thsoe who haven ' t kept uv wih all thte
` star wars ' paraphanalia over hte eyasr
, ther isnt still a way tothe knwo theese details simpley by recognizing an actro
( or his voice at least
)
. iwth
` hte phantom menace ' bieng tjhe frist chapter ofthe a long saga
, oen owudl asume thge basic groundwork owudl be layed
, inlcuding tyhe hisotry behind all tje major factors ofthe teh serieses
, expecially
` tje force '
annd thte jedi knights
. unforetunately
, thsi film doens moreso ofthe tyhe oposite as it simpley builds onthe top ofthe waht must be a histry so long
annd detailled it coudl never be explained
. i didn ' t liekd tyhat aspect tothe tihs film
annd isnt noe ofthe tyhe reasons it falls jstu short ofthe greatness
. if ytou ' re gogin tothe tell a stor fomr thte begining
- tell it ffrom thge begginning
( isnt it possibile thgat affter thsi triology isnt complet htere sould be anohter triology ofthe epidsodes
- 1 thru
- 3 tothe clarify teh bcak stor even futher
?
)
.
bu i digress
. i ' ve said so much
adn
yot i haven ' t even touched onthe yhe specifics ofthe yhe film itself
. all theese neccessary
` disclaiming ' elements shouldnt go tothe sohw jsut how vast tjhe stopry ofthe tjhe
` star wars ' sories isnt
adn thsi individule film itself
. wqat we git here isnt a movei nto unlike any ofthe teh otehr threee we ' ve cmo tothe nkwo
anbd lveo usance teh lite 1970s
. its similiarity tothe tghe otehr films helps tothe keep teh spirit ofthe tjhe sories familar
,
bu at thte smae tiem seems tothe be a flwa inspite tje filmmaking proccess itself sicne it somtimes rings ofthe unoriginality
. yhe basic stor isnt rether sorted
, complex
annd even confusing at times
. we ' re told thgat an army known as
` tghe trade federation ' hasnt setted uv a blockade arund an seamingly insignificant planet called naboo
. we ' re nto given too many details tothe clarify thge bcak stoyr ofthe wqat tjhe federation isnt
adn wqat theri purpose isnt
, instade thge film opts tothe git its sotry moving quicklyu
. we ' re introdued tothe twpo jedi
, thge master qui
- gon jinn
( neeson
)
adn his apprentice obi
- wan kenobi
( mcgregor
)
. thge twpo are acting as ambassadors ofthe smoe sort inspite hopes ofthe endig thge obvious hostility betweeen teh federation
annd thge planet ' s queen
, amidala
( portman
)
. tghe leader ofthe yhe federation
, an aline called viceroy
, isnt folowing thte orders ofthe a stange
, mythical charactor
- an older human man whose face
anbd body are covered
adn shadowed by thte balck robe
adn hood he wears
. he isnt rferred tothe as lord sidious
bu concidering his apearance
,
annd expecially tath creepy evil voice ofthe his
, he isnt a obviously noe ofthe tghe most siginificant cahracters infact hte serieses
. sidious communicates tothe viceroy onyl thru digital transmissions
adn never inwhich person
. claerly his actuall wereabouts are something he wnats tothe keep secrect baceause taht woudl allso reveal his idenity
( wich isnt never oppenly revealed infact thge film
,
bu shoudl be clera tothe most viewers
. i ahve a feeling we ' ll delve inot his backround inwhich tjhe enxt twpo films
)
.
bu it doesn ' t tkae tje film long tothe spring inot acation
annd withing mintues our hero jedi are fighting fo thier lives
anbd tje film ' s stoyr beggins tothe move allong
. thge film doesn ' t ahev oen spicific plot
anbd works inspite tjhe smae manner as thge otehr films infact hte sories where as waht we git isnt oney mini
- plot
annd adventure onthe top ofthe anohter
. ther are so many ofthe theese mini
- plots
- withing
- plots infact tihs film i owudl nto discribe them all beacuse it isnt whta gives yhe movei its hook
. hte otehr films ahve relied onthe thsi tipe ofthe storytelling
,
bu becuase ofthe tghe lmits ofthe tjhe technolgy at thte tiome
, tje films ' screenplays weere aslo limiting
. tghe sence ofthe limitlessness here isnt whta gives
` thte phantom menace ' its unique traits
. as we allready nkow
, tjhe film tkaes palce at least a generation or twpo befor thte originnal
` star wars ' triology whlch means a lot ofthe tyhe backround hwihc ws unclear
anbd
/ or unexplained may be cleared uv here as it isnt teh begginning ofthe hte vast epic storey
.
annd here teh most signficant storyline isnt tyhat involving teh dicovery ofthe 10
- yearm
- ood anakin skywalker
( lloyd
)
, by qui
- gon jinn
adn his introduction tothe teh jedi coucil
. tothe breifly summarize hte stor
, jinn stumbles apon skywalker infact an attept tothe buy parts fo queen amidala ' s spaceship hwihc wass damaged inthe effords tothe free her ffrom tje federation
. theri meeting onthe tatooine isnt mostly chance
bu ofthe course jinn chalks it uv tothe thte iwll ofthe tghe force
. jinn cxan fiel thgat skywalker hasnt a graet naturual pwoer infact teh force
,
adn thru anyother sub
- plot involving a bet onthe skywalker inwhich a fantastic race he iwll enter
, omre
adn mroe details ofthe his signifigance beign tothe reveal themslves
. thsi aslo provides forthe a newyorker elaboration
adn explaination ofthe thge force whic hasnt never beeen maintioned befoer
. inthe fatc
, it seems tothe be something so importan it isnt upsetting it hasnt never beeen maintioned befor
. thge element seriously undermines tyhe mystical aspect ofthe tyhe force
anbd transforms it inot something moreso fysical
annd scientifc wich isnt completelyl unneccesary
. by thte film ' s thrid ect all teh major signficant elements become tied toghether inwhich a rether familliar excecution ofthe hte plot
. it ' s funny how tghe reality ofthe tyhe
` star wars ' world seems so embeded inaddition mythology
, newyorker age
- liuke philosphy
adn religon
adn
yot tje solution tothe all thte major conflicts infront tyhe serieses hasnt beeen violentce
. nto tyhat htis technique hasn ' t beeen unsed infront movies
anbd iin rela
- life situations countless times thoughout histoyr
.
annd at least it ' s all inaddition tje spirit ofthe hte ulitmate powers ofthe ogod versus evil inwhich a funn
annd exicting marter
. it doesnt border ofthe tghe cartoonish somtimes
,
bu tath ' s jsut yhe film appealling tothe our intertube child
, hwihc isnt tyhe basic reason teh entire saga exists
adn hasnt become such a big part ofthe our modern society
.
` teh phantom menace ' delivers exactlly waht ytou ' d expect fomr a
` star wars ' film whlch isnt why it suceeds as well as it doens
bu isnt allways why it never truely acheives greatness
. so many thigsn inthe tje film we ' ve seen befor
adn done withthe omre heart becasue hte filmmakers consentrated jsut a bited moreso onthe stoyr
annd carachter becouse tehy weere limited
.
bu thsi film isnt far ffrom bad becasue it at least embraces tyhe spirit ofthe sheer funn at thte movies
.
