apon arriving at tjhe theather druing tghe oppening credits
, i tookover my seat
adn prepared mysef forthe wqat appeared tothe be
" hellraiser meets thge crowm
"
.
bu as soon as kiefer sutherland began speaking tyhe narrative monologue
, discribing
" yhe strangers
"
annd thier reasons forthe contacting human beings
, i wass hooked
. ther ws something especialy compelling baout tje nature ofthe his voice
. i knew fomr tghe strat thast i wass oging tothe wittness teh actions ofthe his charachter rether tahn thte actro atempting tje charater
. sutherland plyed tghe role as a true vetran
. apon yhe complextion ofthe his monologue
, teh camera arrives onthe sutherland iin such a fashon thta yuo cxan onyl wonder how long alex proyas spended onthe cinematography
. i owudl imagin
, forthe a film ofthe tihs calaber
, taht maximum hurs ofthe wokr weere spended where htey weere needed thge most
. hte film flowed beautifuly
. as i wass bieng taked thru tje intricate regions ofthe tghe
" dark city
"
, a clever plot began tothe unravel
, tothe tyhe point where tghe lsat tyme i hadnt seen such clever plot twists weere infact
" tje usual suspects
"
. nto tothe mention a serieses ofthe speshal effects thgat owudl mkea james cameron litterally turn gren withthe envy
.
bu if yuo ' re nto exactlly yhe biggest sci
- fi fan
, caveat emptor
. git ready forthe tghe atmostpheric darkness ofthe
" 12 monkeys
" or
" tyhe crowm
" wihtout tje boredom or depression
. teh consept ofthe tje plot isnt as mindstretching as
" 12 monkeys
" ws
,
howver
, so be prepared
annd be suphisticated
.
annd imagin a picture thyat finaly doens justice tothe teh comic
- book
- gone
- feature
- film fad tht hollywood hasnt recently become abusive ofthe
. dark city simpley puts
" spawn
" tothe shame
. infact fatc
, druing tje climax ofthe hte film i couldn ' t halp
bu fiel teh storng presense ofthe an
" akira
"
- esque explosion throughtout thge genaral feeling ofthe tyhe movei
. so my inital predicitons weere wrong
. htis film isnt anytying
bu tje meloncholy ofthe
" hellraiser
" parts oney thru five
. i ' m never oney tothe base a film entirly onthe speical effects
, so nkwo thyat whn i give dark city it ' s accually becasue hte film contained all ofthe teh neccessary ingreediants tothe keep me entertained
anbd awake fomr storyline tothe plot twists tothe camerawork tothe even
( tsk
, tsk
