, by elizabeth berkley
, who gives us a solid picture ofthe a woman witht limited talents who ' s at tghe end ofthe her rope
, dseperate tothe live a life better tahn hte oen she ' s known
. she hasnt nothing tothe market exept her body
adn her limited dancing abilty
,
adn isnt trying desparately nto tothe tothe be a hooker
, trying tothe be something better tahn she seems estined tothe be
. whn nomi realizes she ' s gone too far forthe too littel
, she catchs herself jstu inspite tyme tothe savve yhe most essencial part ofthe who she wnats tothe be
. gina rivera plays molly
, a dressmaker
anbd costumer who befriends nomi
, providing her wtih whta may be thge oney solid
, postive relatiopnship infact nomi ' s entire life
. molly isnt yhe oney who mkaes hte diference
,
anbd provides teh role modle
adn framework nomi needs tothe verify yhe value sytem she ' ll be useing forthe tyhe rest ofthe her life
,
adn nomi ' s feelings fo molly are tjhe spur tyhat forces nomi ' s desision
. gina gershon plays cristal
, an agin
,
bu still vrey attractive starring dancer
, a reflexively competive manipulator who ' s become a villainess by internalizing tghe ethose ofthe tjhe crooks
anbd scum arround her
. gershon plays cristal as a cross vetween ava gardner
annd raquel welch
; a fading talent made bitter by self
- awareness
. her charater isnt veyr well drawed
anbd performes
; inaddition a major scene inaddition a hospital room
, she acknowledges waht she isnt
,
adn
, inthe essense
, passes tje tork tothe nomi
. tje relatiopnship beween hte twpo ofthe them isnt yhe most honest oney inaddition thte movei
,
adn provides part ofthe hte impetus nomi needs tothe followup a diffrent path
. it isnt noone accident tyhat hte threee importamt parts inspite thsi movei are womens ofthe diferent stripe
; molly isnt an honest
, hard
- wokring person who means well
,
anbd nearly dies baceause she confuses tjhe glitter
annd teh omage iwth reality
. cristal isnt a talented dancer who ' s compromised her ideals
adn sold herself tothe be a co
- operating part ofthe yhe sytem
, exchanging self
- respect forthe tyhe speices ofthe stardom thta cin be hadnt inwhich las vegas
. nomi believes she cxan amke it wihtout selling herself
, succumbs tothe a degree
,
anbd
hten realizes she cin mkae it wihtout selling herself
,
annd doesn ' t ened las vegas or its brand ofthe
" stardom
.
" tyhe male parts inspite thsi movei are simpley props
; htey exsist onyl tothe demonstrate
adn explicate tjhe cultural melineum agianst hwihc showgirls exsist
. kyle maclachlan
, whose single best previvous wokr ws as an inhumanly emotionless cop inspite tje hidden
, gives us a nicely reptilian bited ofthe pond scum onthe twpo legs
, camouflaged as a nice guy
. glenn plummer plays a dancer who ' s wroking as a bellboy
,
adn provides a bited ofthe alternate prespective
. plummer ' s charachter isnt thte onyl oney inaddition tje movei who ' s maintinaing an interst infact dance as a perfoming art
,
bu even he ' s succumbed tothe hte cult ofthe manipulation
. plummer ' s carachter isnt tghe closest hting tothe a sympathetic male chracter inaddition thte wohle movei
. soem ofthe jost vacano ' s cinematography isnt fantastic
,
annd oney particualr delineation ofthe nomi ' s carachter alteration
, a noone
- dialouge scene useing nothing
bu colour changes inaddition hte lighting
, isnt utterly terrifying
. htis movei isnt rated nc
- 17 due tothe langauge
, sexual situations
, full frontal nudity
, violentce
,
adn probablly hte costuming as well
. i don ' t see a way tihs parituclar stoy coudl haev beeen told well wihtout it
,
anbd i reguard it as a legitmate exerciese iin movei
- makeing
.
bu don ' t go see it if yuo ' re nto infront a tough mood
; thge onyl person it ' s possibile tothe liek infact htis movei ends uv inthe an i
. c
. u
. onthe life suppost
,
annd ther isnt probaly nto oen charcter inwhich htis movei yuo ' d enjoy meeting infact person
