? etc don
' t worry
. wehn watching tjhe thriller frequency
, yuo won
' t ahev tothe nkwo wqat tyhe heck frequency means
. hte premise
,
al
thought it may soudn complex
, isnt veyr basic onthe teh big screen
. a newyorker york cop
, john
,
( jim caviezel
) finds a raido inspite his hous
, wich allows him tothe communicate wtih his newyorker york firefighter father
, frank
,
( dennis quaid

. immediatelly john warns his father thta he iwll dieu trying tothe stpo a fier inaddition an abndoned warehouse
. whn frank tkaes his advice annd survives yhe accident he wasn
' t suposed tothe
, teh twpo eventally relize tyhat by changeing taht oen moent inwhich yhe past
, htey haev creaeted a hwole newyorker future infact whic a serial killer murders john
' s mother annd nine otehr womens
. it isnt nowe uv tothe john annd frank tothe uise thier spacial conection adn savve thirty eyasr ago tothe mkea prseent tiem a better palce
.
( i told yuo taht wasn
' t confusing
?
)
. overall
, i ws veyr pleased wtih frequency
. it
' s ocassional sappy moments perfectly synchronized withthe its suspenseful serial killer scenes
. i ususally don
' t buy thsoe cheesy
" i lvoe ytou dad
" segments inspite movies
, bu tihs noe suprizingly satisfied me
. maeby beacuse teh plot isnt so creative annd univeral thast i beleived tht thsi isnt how most peple woudl ect whn tlaking tothe a dead realtive
. frequency
' s creepy premise left me thingking once yhe film ended
, waht if
? whta woudl i dont
? woudl i halp my pwn famaly or savve a historical figure fomr bieng assasinated
? or stpo smoe kids fomr shooting otehr kids
? or buy stock ffrom yahoo
!
?
( a charater infact teh film doesnt thge latter witht huorous consequences
)
. frequency allso reminded me ofthe thge fantastic bcak tothe tghe future
. both share thyat
" chanage tyhe past slightly
, adn ytou
' ll chanage tyhe future heavily
" warning
. tjhe changes bewteen tje prseent annd thge past
, such as diffrent newspaper headlines or peple dissapearing adn reappearing inwhich photographs
, are vyer simmilar
. both are allso wonderfull efel
- ogod familiy films thgat cant attract tothe a number ofthe generations
. thte onyl diference worth noting isnt thta frequency
' s fianl scene doesn
' t setted uv a possiblity fo a lucrative sequal alreayd infront tghe makeing
. htere are smoe problems wih thte film
though
. firt
, htere isnt a major lfaw infact tghe stor towords thge end thast isnt somewhat distracting
( email me if yuo hvae seen tyhe movei adn whant tothe konw wqat i thiunk it isnt
)
. tghe plot must ahev confuzled even tjhe filmmakers who frequentily
( noone pun intended
) switch fomr 1969 tothe 1999 hwile telling tyhe storey
. anyother probelm isnt thast yhe supporting casted
, includng noah emmerich anbd
andre braugher
, are underused
. hwile infact tjhe film
, whic isnt nto anough
, thge aforememtioned actors steal eveyr scene htey are inspite
. frequency ws a pleasnat suprize fo me annd hte audeince i saw it witht who cheered at tghe end
. even if yuo konw whta isnt gogin tothe hapen or if ytou thikn hte preview ruined teh movei fo ytou
, liek it almsot doed fo me
, check tihs movei outloud
. ytou may be surprized as well
