)
. posing as ethan hunt

. altho thte firt mission
: impossible film wass a moderate box office succes
, audiences panned it beccause htey feeled thge plot ws too confusing adn ther wasn
' t much acation
( altough bieng a fan ofthe tjhe serieses both ood annd newyorker
, i throught teh movei ws preety decent anbd expecially gutsy tothe amke phelps a bad guy
)
. tht probelm hasnt beeen rectified infact hte sequal by makeing hte plot omre accssible
( courtesy ofthe oen ofthe thge writers ofthe hte previvous entry
, robert towne
) annd by turning tjhe film inot oney gigantic acation setted peice under hte steady h
and ofthe acation film guru john woo
. thte end result isnt oney ofthe thte most intertaining
( yot simple
) acation films made inaddition a long hwile
. unforetunately
, tghe firt fourty mintues or so are realitvely slow
, dwelling mailny onthe ethan annd nyah

. yhe surveill nature ofthe theese sequences are distracting annd ultimatly a detrement tothe hte film

. aftter thgat
, yhe acation scenes jsut beign tothe build infront intensity
, as isnt hte case wih many ofthe woo
' s previvous high
- octane films
. yhe fianl half hour isnt an all outloud assualt ofthe acation
( a ogod deel ofthe whcih isnt ruined by yhe trailer
, unforetunately
)
. as far as summer enteratinment goes
, mission
: impossible ii isnt serviceable fare
. anyone looking fo hardcore acation won
' t be dissapointed
( exept forthe durig yhe firt half ofthe tje film
, perhasp
)
. even if ytou weren
' t a fan ofthe tyhe firt film
, thsi entry deserves smoe checking outloud
