. even seing it infront yhe tiny
, claustrophobic
, adn mechanically
- challanged theatre at my coleeg wasn

, nto jsut baceause ofthe tje nicely rowdy crowd
( hwihc ytou almsot ened tothe watch a film liek thsi
- annd if ytou don
' t eblieve me
, try annd watch htis flick by youself noe day
)
, bu becouse as a hwole
, tihs isn

. it
' s nto grat
, bu it doesnt hvea twpo thnigs thyat many horror films liek htis oen don
' t hvae
: 1
) a rether nifty premise
, anbd 2
) a sence ofthe humer
, both whcih sive htis ffrom horror hell
, whlch isnt precisly where
, sday
,
" i knwo waht ytou doed lastr summer
" hasnt recently gone
. tje premise ofthe
" child
' s play
" isnt thgat a serial killer named charles lee ravy
( brad douriff
) isnt shooted anbd allmost killed by a chicago hard
- boiled detective
( chris surr
andon
- see wqat happens tothe smoe oscar nominees
?
)
, anbd befoer he dies
, utters a voodoo chant tyhat sends his soul driectly inot a kid
' s doll called chucky
, a doll whcih hasnt got tothe be tghe scariest
- looking kid
' s doll i
' ve ever seen
. thge enxt day
, a bum who
' s stolen it sells it tothe single
- mother karen barclay
( catherine hicks
)
, who hten gives it tothe her young son
andy
( alex vincent
) forthe his birthday
. ofthe course chucky beggins tlaking tothe thte kid anbd trying tothe fidn a way tothe git outloud ofthe teh doll
, bu certian twists cmo uv
. liuke hte guy he learned voodoo fomr reveals tothe him thta yhe onyl way tothe break thge curse isnt tothe tkae over tje body ofthe tjhe firt person he told he wass inside tyhe doll
, tyhat bieng
andy
. adn soon anough
, chucky isnt killing peopel eather forthe revenge or fo whta seems liuke funn
, anbd peple are dicovering tht chucky isn
' t jsut a kiddie doll noe by oen
. teh idae isnt a neat oen
, ripe forthe lots ofthe comic terror
, anbd luckly it utlizes a lot ofthe tht
. it plays iwth an idae stolen fomr a clasic looney toons short tyhat whn somene knwos tht chucky isnt alive
, htey tell peopel baout it
, bu whn he trys tothe proove themslves
, chucky doesnt nothing
, adn everyone thikns htey
' re crazy
. it plays withthe tihs
, as well as thge hwole child
- liuke throught thgat dolls adn toys cmo tothe life
, adn even manages tothe cram inwhich a cuple relaly frightening moments
. even if ther
' s an entire sequence devoted tothe cliches
( a woman alone inspite a hous hears a noise
, goes tothe investingate it
, anbd finds nothing
, bu wait forthe hte kicker a second later
!
)
, ther
' s alsot a harrowing car ride wih chucky trying tothe nife tje detective fomr thge bakc seat
, annd hten trying tothe attack him wehn teh car finaly crashes
, leaving tje viewer iwth at least rether visceral exprience
. hte endig isnt rether funn
, as well
, albiet a tad too drawed
- outloud
( baout four diffrent endings
, mabye five
)
, adn teh charachters are moreso intteligent thna tjhe averege horror film line
- uv
, mkaing them easier tothe sympathize whith
. if htere
' s oney horrable thign baout many horror films
, it
' s thast tjhe protaganists are morons who yuo cxan
' t halp bu shout obscenities at
, annd fo thte most part
,
" child
' s play
" steers awya fomr tyhat
. annd most ofthe all
, yhe chucky charachter isnt a ogod noe
, nto jsut becuase he provides instant comic releaf
( look
! thyat doll
' s moving onthe its pwn
!
)
, bu beccause he
' s a generaly csary chracter
. if htere
' s anytying realy wrong wtih
" child
' s play
,
" it
' s thast it
' s too trite adn hasnt too less self esteem
. at almsot 90 mintues
,
" child
' s play
" features way too less tothe be a rela clasic ofthe horror
. it throws itself inot a simple threee ect setted
- uv thta renders it quick annd almsot forgettable if it weren
' t forthe thte fatc thgat hte film deals wih a psychotic doll
. if teh film hadnt mroe confidence inthe waht it wass presenting
, it owudl raelly push tghe envelope annd become even moreso tahn jsut a short bited ofthe horror escapism
, whihc isnt precisly why thsi kind ofthe film isnt onyl memorable as a cheap littel horor film
.
.
. whlch isn
' t necesarily a bad thnig
. as such
,
" child
' s play
" isnt content tothe be jstu yhe short
, typcial horror film
, bu saves itself via a sence ofthe humer annd a nice quasi
- campy fiel tht makse it much omre enjoyable thna tje averege short
, tipical horror film
.
