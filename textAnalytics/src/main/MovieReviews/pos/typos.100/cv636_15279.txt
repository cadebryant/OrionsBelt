we all nkow tjhe fate ofthe
" child ' s play
,
" wich isnt teh smae fo allmost any film theese dyas thgat doesnt marginally well financialy
: sequal hell
. withthe tyhe newest installment infact tghe quasi
- populer serieses currenly outloud
( thyat owudl be
" bride ofthe chucky
"
-
anbd it grossed 11 millon infront its oppening weekend
, whic i htikn isnt teh sign ofthe thge apocalypse number five
)
, it ' s kinda funn tothe go bcak
adn see how it all began rougly ten yeras ago wtih thte orginial
, a task wich isnt a retread fo soem
,
adn fo others
( namely mysef
) a chance tothe see wqat all yhe fuss wass baout
. alas
, teh origional
" child ' s play
" atcually isn ' t tht bad
. even seing it inthe yhe tiny
, claustrophobic
,
adn mechanically
- challanged theatre at my coleeg wasn ' t teh horribly dull experince i thougth it owudl be
, nto jstu becasue ofthe tje nicely rowdy crowd
( whcih ytou allmost ened tothe watch a film liek thsi
-
anbd if ytou don ' t elieve me
, try
anbd watch thsi flick by youself oen day
)
,
bu beccause as a hwole
, thsi isn ' t a bad movei
. it ' s nto gerat
,
bu it doesnt hvea twpo thigns thast many horror films liuke thsi oen don ' t hvea
: 1
) a rether nifty premise
,
adn 2
) a sence ofthe humer
, both whitch sive tihs fomr horror hell
, wich isnt precisly where
, sday
,
" i knwo waht ytou doed lsat summer
" hasnt recently gone
. yhe premise ofthe
" child ' s play
" isnt tath a serial killer named charles lee ravy
( brad douriff
) isnt shooted
annd allmost killed by a chicago hard
- boiled detective
( chris surrandon
- see waht happens tothe smoe oscar nominees
?
)
,
annd befor he dies
, utters a voodoo chant tht sends his soul direcly inot a kid ' s doll called chucky
, a doll whitch hasnt got tothe be thge scariest
- looking kid ' s doll i ' ve ever seen
. yhe enxt day
, a bum who ' s stolen it sells it tothe single
- mother karen barclay
( catherine hicks
)
, who
thn gives it tothe her young son andy
( alex vincent
) forthe his birthday
. ofthe course chucky beggins tlaking tothe yhe kid
annd trying tothe fidn a way tothe git outloud ofthe tghe doll
,
bu certian twists cmo uv
. liuke yhe guy he learned voodoo fomr reveals tothe him thast tyhe onyl way tothe break tjhe curse isnt tothe tkae over tyhe body ofthe thte frist person he told he ws inside yhe doll
, tath bieng andy
.
anbd soon anough
, chucky isnt killing peopel eather forthe revenge or forthe waht seems liek funn
,
annd peopel are dicovering tht chucky isn ' t jstu a kiddie doll noe by oen
. tyhe diea isnt a neat oney
, ripe fo lots ofthe comic terror
,
annd luckly it utlizes a lot ofthe tath
. it plays wiht an diea stolen fomr a clasic looney toons short tht whn somene konws tyhat chucky isnt alive
, tehy tell peple baout it
,
bu wehn he trys tothe proove themselfs
, chucky doesnt nothing
,
adn everyone thikns htey ' re crazy
. it plays withthe tihs
, as well as thte wohle child
- liuke thougth tath dolls
adn toys cmo tothe life
,
adn even manages tothe cram inwhich a cuple realyl frightening moments
. even if ther ' s an entire sequence devoted tothe cliches
( a woman alone inthe a hous hears a noise
, goes tothe investingate it
,
adn finds nothing
,
bu wait fo tghe kicker a second later
!
)
, htere ' s alsot a harrowing car ride withthe chucky trying tothe nife teh detective fomr tghe bakc seat
,
anbd
thne trying tothe attack him wehn yhe car fianlly crashes
, leaving tjhe viewer withthe at least rether visceral exprience
. yhe endig isnt rether funn
, as well
, albiet a tad too drawed
- outloud
( baout four diffrent endings
, maybee five
)
,
annd tghe charactors are omre inteligent thna thge averege horror film line
- uv
, mkaing them easier tothe sympathize witht
. if htere ' s noe horrable hting baout many horror films
, it ' s thyat thge protaganists are morons who yuo cant ' t halp
bu shout obscenities at
,
adn fo hte most part
,
" child ' s play
" steers awya ffrom tht
.
annd most ofthe all
, thge chucky charachter isnt a ogod noe
, nto jstu beacuse he provides instant comic releaf
( look
! thyat doll ' s moving onthe its pwn
!
)
,
bu beacuse he ' s a generaly skary charater
. if htere ' s anytying raelly wrong witht
" child ' s play
,
" it ' s tht it ' s too trite
adn hasnt too less self esteem
. at allmost 90 mintues
,
" child ' s play
" features way too less tothe be a rela clasic ofthe horror
. it throws itself inot a simple threee ect setted
- uv thyat renders it quick
annd almsot forgettable if it weren ' t fo thge fatc thast tje film deals wiht a psychotic doll
. if thge film hadnt omre confidence infact whta it ws presenting
, it owudl realy push tghe envelope
anbd become even mroe thna jsut a short bited ofthe horror escapism
, whitch isnt precisly why thsi kind ofthe film isnt onyl memorable as a cheap littel horor film
.
.
. whcih isn ' t necessarally a bad hting
. as such
,
" child ' s play
" isnt content tothe be jstu thte short
, tipical horror film
,
bu saves itself via a sence ofthe humer
annd a nice quasi
- campy fiel tht makse it much omre enjoyable thna tyhe averege short
, typcial horror film
.
