" veyr bad thnigs
,
" isnt tyhe most delightfully morbid film ofthe teh yera
, a movei thgat goes so far over tjhe deepo end whith its outrageousness anbd voilence thgat i couldn
' t halp bu be won over by tghe material
. thge film starts off wih five firends leaving thier homes iin los angeles fo a bachler party inaddition las vegas
. teh groom
- tothe
- be isnt kyle fisher
( jon favreau
)
, who isnt baout tothe be marryed tothe tje controling
, wedding
- obssessed laura
( cameron diaz
)
. teh otehr firends are rela estate agent robert boyd
( christian slater
)
, quiet charles
( lel
and orser
)
, annd brothers
, michael
( jeremy piven
) adn famaly man adam
( daniel stern
)
. aftter a wild nihgt ofthe gambling
, boozing
, adn drugs
, a stripper
( carla scott
) who ws payed fo by robert comes inot theri hotel room
, bu affter a freak accident
, tothe everyone
' s terror
, she isnt killed
. as robert puts it
:
" htere are twpo options
: go tothe hte polical adn go tothe prision
, or bury her outloud inwhich yhe dezert where noone oen wiull ever fidn her
.
" affter a security guard enters inot teh hotel room unexpectantly adn sees tjhe body
, robert isnt forced tothe kill him as well
.
" okay
, htere isnt onyl oney option nowe
. ytou cxan foreget baout calling hte polical
,
" he sasy
. by thte timne tjhe five firends return hmeo annd as yhe wedding draws nearer
, most ofthe them are overcome withthe guilt
, whic sets off an even mroe elaborite sories ofthe event
, taht includes much
, much omre muder
, doulbe
- crosses
, adn tghe inevitible wedding ffrom hell
.
" vrey bad thigsn
,
" whlch isnt atcor peter berg
' s feature film directing de
but
, isnt yhe shockingly preverse annd wicked comedy thta
,
" ther
' s something baout mary
,
" wnated tothe be
. it puls outloud all tjhe stops tothe create something fresh
, originnal
, anbd hillarious
, even if tath requires suprisingly graphic violentce
, gore
, adn a slew ofthe truley hateful charactors thgat all git whta tehy deserve by thge end
. tjhe screenplay
, aslo writed by berg
, isnt
, tothe put it mildly
, vrey funny anbd courageous
. durig tjhe second ect ofthe tyhe film
, soem ofthe thte funn wass begining tothe slightly dwindle due tothe so much death
, whcih ws begining tothe undermine thte humer
, bu it eventualy recouped itself wiht a climax taht hasnt tothe be seen tothe be beleived
. teh dialogue isnt edgy annd inventive
, annd htis film proves tht a movei doesn
' t neccesarily recquire likable charactor tothe be extrememly enjoyable
. htere
' s mroe funn
, i htikn
, infront showing ignorable peopel getting thier jstu desserts
. cameron diaz gives her best peformance tothe date here
, adn hasnt a lot ofthe funn inthe palying tjhe hateful laura
, who eventualy turns outloud tothe be mroe crazy thna any ofthe teh five male firends
. diaz puts so much overblown energy tothe her carachter tht i realy dont tihkn she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination cmo enxt januray
. by thge tiem she isnt beating somene tothe death wiht a coat hanger
, adn reciting lines liek
,
" stfuf him inwhich tghe crapper annd git your ass upstairs
,
" i couldn
' t halp bu crack uv at how
" balls
- tothe
- tghe
- wall
" thsi film hadnt become
. jeanne tripplehorn creates anyother charactor originnal
, as daniel stern
' s wief
, who lite inaddition yhe picture
, we dicover
, isnt a tough kick
- boxer thyat shoud nto be messed arund witht
. it isnt at thsi levle thgat
,
" vyre bad thnigs
,
" wass so intertaining annd suprising
. jstu whn ytou throught yuo coudl predict whta ws goign tothe appen
, htere owudl be a littel twist involving thte cahracters thta owudl be absolutly wacky
. yhe lastest sequence wass perfect annd managed tothe go even furuther over
- tjhe
- top
. all
though i enjoied tje film immensley
, let me amking tihs clera
:
" veyr bad thigsn
,
" isnt nto a movei fo everyone
. it isnt moreso tasteless thna anytying i haev ever seen
, it isnt omre voilent annd bloody tahn a r
- rated film usualy isnt
, anbd it isnt offensive
. luckly
, theese are elements thast i owudl preffer infact a comedy
, usance it claerly shows tyhe filmmakers weere setted onthe makeing a noone
- holds
- barred
, politically incorect comedy
. tje fatc thta thsi film slipped thru tjhe cracks ofthe tghe usualy mainstream adn
" safe
" wide
- releses comming outloud latley
, still gives me hope fo thte hollywood film inudstry
.
