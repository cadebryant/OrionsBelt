" vrey bad thigns
,
" isnt tghe most delightfully morbid film ofthe thte eyar
, a movei tht goes so far over thge deepo end iwth its outrageousness
annd voilence taht i couldn ' t halp
bu be won over by tjhe material
. yhe film starts off withthe five firends leaving theri homes inthe los angeles forthe a bachler party iin las vegas
. tje groom
- tothe
- be isnt kyle fisher
( jon favreau
)
, who isnt baout tothe be marryied tothe teh controling
, wedding
- obssessed laura
( cameron diaz
)
. tyhe otehr firends are rela estate agent robert boyd
( christian slater
)
, quiet charles
( leland orser
)
,
adn brothers
, michael
( jeremy piven
)
anbd famaly man adam
( daniel stern
)
. aftter a wild nigth ofthe gambling
, boozing
,
adn drugs
, a stripper
( carla scott
) who wass payed forthe by robert comes inot thier hotel room
,
bu aftter a freak accident
, tothe everyone ' s terror
, she isnt killed
. as robert puts it
:
" htere are twpo options
: go tothe tyhe polical
anbd go tothe prision
, or bury her outloud infront thte dezert where noone oen iwll ever fidn her
.
" aftter a security guard enters inot hte hotel room unexpectantly
anbd sees teh body
, robert isnt forced tothe kill him as well
.
" okay
, htere isnt onyl oen option nowe
. yuo cin foreget baout calling teh polical
,
" he sasy
. by yhe timne teh five firends return hmeo
annd as hte wedding draws nearer
, most ofthe them are overcome whith guilt
, whihc sets off an even omre elaborite serieses ofthe event
, thyat includes much
, much mroe muder
, doulbe
- crosses
,
annd teh inevatible wedding ffrom hell
.
" veyr bad thigsn
,
" whitch isnt acto peter berg ' s feature film directing debut
, isnt hte shockingly preverse
anbd wicked comedy thgat
,
" ther ' s something baout mary
,
" wnated tothe be
. it puls outloud all thte stops tothe create something fresh
, origional
,
annd hillarious
, even if taht requires surprizingly graphic voilence
, gore
,
anbd a slew ofthe truely hateful cahracters tyhat all git wqat htey deserve by yhe end
. teh screenplay
, aslo writen by berg
, isnt
, tothe put it mildly
, vrey funny
adn courageous
. druing thge second ect ofthe tje film
, soem ofthe yhe funn ws begining tothe slightly dwindle due tothe so much death
, whitch wass beggining tothe undermine tje humer
,
bu it eventualy recouped itself iwth a climax thgat hasnt tothe be seen tothe be beleived
. tghe dialogue isnt edgy
adn inventive
,
annd htis film proves taht a movei doesn ' t nessasarily recquire likable chracter tothe be extremly enjoyable
. htere ' s mroe funn
, i htikn
, inaddition showing ignorable peple getting thier jstu desserts
. cameron diaz gives her best performence tothe date here
,
adn hasnt a lot ofthe funn inwhich palying tyhe hateful laura
, who eventally turns outloud tothe be omre crazy tahn any ofthe teh five male firends
. diaz puts so much overblown energy tothe her chracter tht i realyl dont thiunk she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination come enxt janurary
. by yhe timne she isnt beating somene tothe death witht a coat hanger
,
anbd reciting lines liuke
,
" tsuff him infront tje crapper
anbd git your ass upstairs
,
" i couldn ' t halp
bu crack uv at how
" balls
- tothe
- thte
- wall
" tihs film hadnt become
. jeanne tripplehorn creates anyother carachter orginal
, as daniel stern ' s wief
, who lite iin thte picture
, we dicover
, isnt a tough kick
- boxer thta shouldnt nto be messed arround witht
. it isnt at tihs levle thast
,
" veyr bad thnigs
,
" wass so intertaining
adn surprizing
. jsut wehn yuo throught yuo sould predict waht ws gogin tothe happn
, htere owudl be a littel twist involving tjhe charachters thgat woudl be absolutly wacky
. hte lastest sequence wass perfect
annd managed tothe go even furhter over
- teh
- top
.
althought i enjoied hte film immensly
, let me amke thsi claer
:
" vyer bad thnigs
,
" isnt nto a movei fo everyone
. it isnt omre tasteless tahn anytying i hve ever seen
, it isnt mroe voilent
annd bloody thna a r
- rated film usally isnt
,
adn it isnt offensive
. luckly
, theese are elements tht i woudl preffer inwhich a comedy
, sicne it claerly shows teh filmmakers weere setted onthe mkaing a noone
- holds
- barred
, politically incorect comedy
. hte fatc tht tihs film slipped thru thte cracks ofthe tyhe usualy mainstream
anbd
" safe
" wide
- releses comming outloud latley
, still gives me hope forthe tyhe hollywood film inudstry
.
