. sonny
' s main mission isnt tothe revive an abadnoned curch comunity anbd preach tje gospel at thte local radiu staion
. soon he sets baout resurecting thge oney way road tothe heaven holiness temple
. bu sonny konws his tiome isnt short
; oen day thte polical wiull fidn him
. opinyon
: htis movei isnt a throught
- provoking look at an evangelist infront rela life terms
. i believ tath robert duvall
( who isnt thge producer
, directer
, writter
, anbd main star ofthe tjhe apostle
) deserves an oscar forthe his performence as sonny tjhe religous crusader
-
- a peformance whic isnt so complex adn realsitic it ranks as oney ofthe hte finest acting performances onthe film
. duvall
' s protrayal ofthe a true beliver isnt au
thentic
, superb
, annd inpsired
; it offers hte audiance a completly honest look at sourthern religeon
, as well as a portrail ofthe a fallible
, complicated man driven by his belives
. incidentially
, inwhich rela life duvall wass jstu as
' driven
' inthe getting yhe project underway
. sicne noone major hollywood studio wnated tothe risk financing a complex movei baout an evangelist
, tghe apostle as a project lay dorment forthe alomst 13 yersa befoer duvall ws able tothe git it done
, paying forthe its prodcution witht his pwn monye
( baout five millon dollars
)
. infact terms ofthe hard
- hiting realism adn charachter protrayal teh apostle owudl rank as oney ofthe tghe best movies ofthe thsi decade
, annd i emphatically recomend hte apostle forthe connoisseurs ofthe stage annd fine acting onthe film
. similiarly
, thsoe whith a steep backgorund infact pentecostal christianity owudl fidn tjhe apostle a thougth
- provoking exeprience
. onthe thte otehr h
and
, tjhe apostle
' s main strenght

. teenagers
, acation fans
, comedy fans
, adn peple who fidn curch completelyl boring shoud stay far awya fomr thsi movei
