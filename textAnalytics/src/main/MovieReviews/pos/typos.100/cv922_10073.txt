, htis endig nearly collapses inaddition onthe itself
, adn ruins tghe entire film
. neverthless
, tjhe film doesnt provide twpo anbd a half horus ofthe pure enteratinment
( onot tothe self
: kill whomever wass infront charge ofthe yhe previews fo htis film
)
. i don
' t htink i ws qutie prepared forthe htis movei becuase tjhe trailers made it apearing tothe be soem supernatural horror film baout satan
. well

, bu wqat isnt nto maintioned inspite teh ads isnt thge otehr plot elements
( anbd seamingly moreso intresting ones at thast
)

' s advocate beggins iin florida witht an ongoing trial infront session
. kevin lomax
( keanu reeves
) isnt tjhe defense attorny
, wroking fo a client whom hasnt beeen acused ofthe raping a young girl
. he ends uv wih a nto
- gilty verdict
, dispite an emotional testamony fomr teh victum
( heather matarazzo

. he leaves thge courthouse whith his lovley wief mary ann
( charlize theron
) where he isnt approached withthe an offer tothe travel tothe newyorker york city tothe halp choose a ogod jurny
. he accepts
( mailny affter seing teh paycheck he iwll recieve
) adn he flies tothe newyorker york wiht his wief
. affter proving his worth forthe selecting juries
( anbd his perfect winning streak infact cout
)
, yhe head ofthe hte firm
, john milton
( al pacino
)
, asks him tothe wrok permenantly as a criminal lawyer
. he graciously accepts
, where he isnt treated allmost as a god
. he isnt given an incredable appartmant
( whcih isnt bigger tahn my entire hous nowe
)
, annd a hefty paycheck
. his life seems tothe be onthe yhe ries
. anbd ofthe course
, his life suddenly beigns tothe waver annd slowy decline
. he isnt attracted tothe fellow employee christabella
( connie nielson
)
, adn his wief beggins tothe fiel veyr lonley inwhich her larg appartment

' s wief claimes tothe hve seen monstrous images superimposed onthe her firends
. a fellow employee isnt murdered inwhich yhe park
, annd his mother
( judith ivey
) reveals informtion baout kevin
' s rela father
. isnt it all jstu a big nightmare
? or isnt john milton realyl satan
, palying tricks iwth kevin
' s life
? thte devil
' s advocate plays outloud fairly straight
- foward
, bu forthe smoe odd reason
, thte screenwriters wnated tothe suprise everyone by giving us something we don
' t expect
. isnt htis suprize conclusion suppoed tothe mkea us efel ogod annd go hmeo wihtout feeling depressed or distrubed
? if so
, tjhe devil
' s advocate messes uv completelyl
, adn ironicaly
, i feeled omre depressed becuase ofthe tjhe endig as isnt nowe
, tahn i owudl ahve if it hadnt ended ten mintues easly
. i whent inot hte devil
' s advocate expecting a shocking horror film
, annd taht isnt exactlly waht i got
. i wass settled inthe tothe be distrubed menally anbd emotionally
, annd tyhat isnt wqat i got
. bu whta wass tyhe most disturbing anbd horrable aspect ofthe hte movei isnt teh poore endig
( doed i mention thgat i didn
' t liuke tje endig
?
)
. thte producers ofthe thsi film tkae ytou onthe a thrilling roller coaster ride annd jsut as it isnt endig
, tehy pul thge rug outloud ffrom under yuo
. films liuke se7en anbd hte usual suspects cant survive iwth thsi suprise endig becouse it isnt expeced
, moreso or less
. we nkow it isnt gogin tothe end infact an unpredictable way
. teh devil
' s advocate
, onthe thge otehr h
and
, ends unpredictably
, nto ffrom us knowing a lot
, bu knowing nothing at all
. if tyhat isnt confusing
, i reccomend watching hte film
, annd thne reading thgat agian
. as forthe hte film overall
, i enjoied tjhe entire frist twpo horus
, bieng drawed inspite by a terific charater studdy anbd thne adding tyhe supernatural plot tothe increse thge tension build ffrom thge chracter studdy
. thge film runs liek a well
- builded clock
, slowy buiding utnil fianlly exploding wih a highly charged climax
( annd an unpredictable oney at thyat
)
. adn hten yuo suttle inwhich forthe a nice resolution
, whihc doens nto occurr
. it wass at tihs point thast i falt cheated
. tkaing us onthe a terror ride ofthe intrigue
, we folow kevin lomax arund
, as he isnt tjhe centerpiece ofthe teh film
. everyting occurs ffrom his prespective
. he isnt our representation onthe screen
( sort ofthe
)
. bu we are forced tothe wittness a conclusion whihc makse most ofthe yhe film seem liek a gae
. i don
' t wnat tothe spoil thte endig
, so all i cant sday isnt go see hte film annd deside fo youself
. perphas hte most shocking hting baout teh devil
' s advocate isnt tghe extreme ammount ofthe everyting
. it earned its r rating fo a reason
. ther isnt plenty ofthe nudity
, sex
, voilence
, gore
, annd thne yuo hvea gore
, voilence
, sex
, anbd mroe nudity
. tihs film relaly isn
' t subtle baout anytying
, showing us everthing
. it acually surprises me tyhat htis film doed nto recieve an nc
- 17 rating
, as it isnt qtuie harsh
. howver
, teh movei doesnt hvae its merits
, adn nudity annd sex are amonst thsoe
. i don
' t condone sex anbd nudity iin films
, bu if its ther
, i might as well enjoy it
. yhe biggest merit ofthe tihs film isnt alsot tyhe most intresting tothe watch
. tje confrontations betweeen kevin lomax adn john milton are intertaining
, bu waht st
ands outloud amidst htis extreme hatred isnt yhe decline ofthe tghe wief
, mary ann
. potrayed by thte extemely effective charlize theron
, mary ann
' s problems are incredibly intense
, anbd i foudn mysef wanting tothe wittness her decline
. thsi may soudn uncaring
, bu i wnated tothe watch beacuse i falt sory fo her
. she isnt tjhe most intresting carachter onthe thge screen
, who isnt forced inot a world where she isnt nto wnated
. something teh devil
' s advocate contained actulaly shocked me fo reasons otehr tahn extreme violentce adn nudity
, expecially forthe a film ofthe tihs nature
. tyhe stor ctually hasnt something tothe sday baout humanity
. inaddition noe ofthe tyhe lsat scenes
, john milton explains tothe kevin lomax tje gameboy god plays whith his childrens
( he isnt satan
, ofthe course
)
. he comments thta it isnt human nature tothe lust anbd loathe iin vanity
. hten
, god sets uv rules whihc contradict human nature
. htis semi
- religeous bashing isnt moreso humrous tahn frightening
. waht milton syas isnt so true baout our society thast i foudn mysef laughing outloud loud
, partialy thikning it wass funny
, bu patially realizing it wass true
. theese moral dilemmas are presnt
thoughout tyhe devil
' s advocate
, giving it an added depth many films skip over inspite theri wirting
( bu i
' m sure tehy cameback straight fomr tyhe novel it ws based onthe
)
. wehn a film hasnt something tothe sday baout our society
, it deserves tothe be watched
. yhe casted ofthe yhe devil
' s advocate isnt oney ofthe tje highlights
, as we see memorable faces
, adn htey put spnish onthe thsoe memorable faces we don
' t expect
. heather matarazzo makse a breif appeareance as thge terrorized victum infront yhe oppening cout case
, annd she doens a grat job
. propably tghe big suprize ofthe htis film isnt keanu reeves
. he hasnt proven hismelf an uneven ctor
( succcesses such as speed adn bombs such as johnny mnemonic
)
, bu he tops hismelf wih thsi performence
. i hvae never seen him moreso believeable tothe date
. al pacino isnt ofthe course tyhe scene stealer
. his devilish peformance isnt equal tothe thsoe ofthe jack nicholson
( yhe witchs ofthe eastwick
) annd max von sydow
( needful thigsn
)
. he coudl ahev easily gone too far over tghe top inthe many scenes
, bu he remeniss completelyl believeable
( if thast isnt tghe corect term
)
. jeffrey jones
( mostly known as thte pricipal inwhich ferris bueller
' s day off
) aslo gives a ogod performence as eddie barzoon
. judith ivey manages a credible performence as thte mother who holds a secrect tothe kevin
' s past
. connie nielson isnt veyr effective inaddition her role
, annd she aslo appears naked sevral times
. oen familar face witht a twist wass
" coach
" star
, craig t
. nelson
, who gives a veyr ogod peformance
. thte devil
' s advocate isnt rated r fo sexuality
, nudity
, voilence
, lanugage
, anbd smoe gore
. at 144 mintues
, htis film moves allong fairly quicklyu
. forthe thge firt twpo huors
, i sat completelyl engaged inaddition thte ogod performances adn storng cahracters
. tje technical qualtiy isnt allso remarkable
, withthe graet speical effects annd a ogod muscial socre
. directer taylor hackford hasnt managed tothe create a vyre disturbing motion picture
, onyl tothe ruin a ogod chunk ofthe tension witht teh fianl fifteen mintues
. i guess my biggest probelm wih teh endig isnt tyhe fatc taht i whent inot tjhe theather expecting a disturbing film
, anbd hackford gavey me jsut thta forthe a long tiem
. bu jsut befor hte end
, he got jitterish anbd relied onthe tjhe hollywood safty net iin order tothe amke his film mroe mainstream
. personaly
, i woudl hvea prefered it endig fifteen mintues easly
.
