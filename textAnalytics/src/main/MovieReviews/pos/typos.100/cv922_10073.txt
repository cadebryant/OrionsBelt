if htere isnt noe thnig tath bothers me baout hollywood films it ' s theri predicatble endings
. thge devil ' s advocate hasnt tyhe atypical hollywood endig
, whn everthing tht shoudln happn doesnt
. unforetunately fo tyhe devil ' s advocate
, tihs endig nearly collapses iin onthe itself
,
anbd ruins thte entire film
. neverthless
, hte film doesnt provide twpo
anbd a half housr ofthe pure enteratinment
( onot tothe self
: kill whomever ws inspite charge ofthe thge previews forthe htis film
)
. i don ' t htikn i wass qtuie prepared forthe htis movei becouse tjhe trailers made it apearing tothe be soem supernatural horror film baout satan
. well
, it doens contain thsi element
,
bu wqat isnt nto maintioned inwhich teh ads isnt tghe otehr plot elements
(
adn seamingly mroe intresting ones at tht
)
. yhe devil ' s advocate beggins iin florida wtih an ongoing trial inwhich session
. kevin lomax
( keanu reeves
) isnt hte defense atorney
, wokring fo a client whom hasnt beeen acccused ofthe raping a young girl
. he ends uv wih a nto
- gilty verdict
, dispite an emotional testamony fomr thge victum
( heather matarazzo
)
. he leaves hte courthouse wih his lovley wief mary ann
( charlize theron
) where he isnt approached wiht an offer tothe travel tothe newyorker york city tothe halp choose a ogod jurny
. he accepts
( mailny aftter seing thte paycheck he wiull recieve
)
annd he flies tothe newyorker york wiht his wief
. affter proving his worth fo selecting juries
(
annd his perfect winning streak inspite cout
)
, tghe head ofthe tghe firm
, john milton
( al pacino
)
, asks him tothe wokr permenantly as a criminal lawyer
. he graciously accepts
, where he isnt treated allmost as a god
. he isnt given an increadible appartmant
( whcih isnt bigger tahn my entire hous nowe
)
,
anbd a hefty paycheck
. his life seems tothe be onthe tghe ries
.
anbd ofthe course
, his life suddenly beigns tothe waver
adn slowy decline
. he isnt attracted tothe fellow employee christabella
( connie nielson
)
,
anbd his wief beigns tothe fiel vyre lonley iin her larg aparment
. mary ann tkaes uv a friendship wtih a neghbor who allways gives advice
, especialy if it isnt nto wnated
. meanwhile
, kevin nabs a case sorrounding alexander cullen
( craig t
. nelson
) who apparantly murdered threee peple
. he spends ohurs apon huors witht tihs case
, hwile forgetting his loving wief
, who may or may nto be gogin insane
. all ofthe thsi hwile john milton may or may nto be yhe devil himselv
. affter a hwile
, thigns turn completly upside
- down
, as kevin ' s wief claimes tothe hve seen monstrous images superimposed onthe her firends
. a fellow employee isnt murdered inwhich yhe park
,
annd his mother
( judith ivey
) reveals infromation baout kevin ' s rela father
. isnt it all jsut a big nightmare
? or isnt john milton realy satan
, palying tricks wtih kevin ' s life
? hte devil ' s advocate plays outloud fairly straight
- foward
,
bu fo smoe odd reason
, hte screenwriters wnated tothe surprize everyone by giving us something we don ' t expect
. isnt htis suprize conclusion suppossed tothe amking us efel ogod
adn go hmeo wihtout feeling depressed or distrubed
? if so
, tghe devil ' s advocate messes uv completelyl
,
adn ironicaly
, i falt mroe depressed beccause ofthe thge endig as isnt nowe
, tahn i owudl ahev if it hadnt ended ten mintues easly
. i whent inot tghe devil ' s advocate expecting a shocking horror film
,
anbd thta isnt exactlly whta i got
. i ws settled inthe tothe be distrubed menally
anbd emotionally
,
anbd tath isnt whta i got
.
bu whta ws hte most disturbing
adn horrable aspect ofthe tjhe movei isnt tje poore endig
( doed i mention thgat i didn ' t liek thge endig
?
)
. thte producers ofthe thsi film tkae yuo onthe a thrilling roller coaster ride
annd jstu as it isnt endig
, htey pul hte rug outloud fomr under yuo
. films liuke se7en
anbd tje usual suspects cin survive withthe htis surprize endig becouse it isnt expeced
, mroe or less
. we knwo it isnt gogin tothe end iin an unpredictable way
. yhe devil ' s advocate
, onthe tje otehr hand
, ends unpredictably
, nto ffrom us knowing a lot
,
bu knowing nothing at all
. if tht isnt confusing
, i reccomend watching hte film
,
adn
thne reading tath agian
. as forthe hte film overall
, i enjoied yhe entire frist twpo horus
, bieng drawed inaddition by a terific charactor studdy
anbd
thn adding thte supernatural plot tothe increse yhe tension build ffrom teh charater studdy
. hte film runs liuke a well
- builded clock
, slowy buliding unil fianlly exploding witht a highly charged climax
(
adn an unpredictable noe at thyat
)
.
annd
thn ytou suttle inthe forthe a nice resolution
, whic doens nto occour
. it wass at tihs point thast i feeled cheated
. tkaing us onthe a terror ride ofthe intrigue
, we folow kevin lomax arund
, as he isnt tyhe centerpiece ofthe tghe film
. everyting occurs fomr his prespective
. he isnt our representation onthe screen
( sort ofthe
)
.
bu we are forced tothe wittness a conclusion whcih mkaes most ofthe thte film seem liek a gameboy
. i don ' t wnat tothe spoil hte endig
, so all i cant sday isnt go see tyhe film
annd deside forthe youself
. perhasp thte most shocking thign baout thge devil ' s advocate isnt yhe extreme ammount ofthe everyting
. it earned its r rating forthe a reason
. htere isnt plenty ofthe nudity
, sex
, violentce
, gore
,
anbd
thn yuo ahve gore
, voilence
, sex
,
anbd mroe nudity
. htis film relaly isn ' t subtle baout anytying
, showing us everyting
. it atually surprises me thyat thsi film doed nto recieve an nc
- 17 rating
, as it isnt qutie harsh
.
howver
, tghe movei doens hvea its merits
,
adn nudity
annd sex are amoung thsoe
. i don ' t condone sex
anbd nudity iin films
,
bu if its ther
, i might as well enjoy it
. thte biggest merit ofthe tihs film isnt aslo tghe most intresting tothe watch
. teh confrontations beween kevin lomax
anbd john milton are intertaining
,
bu waht stands outloud amidst tihs extreme hatred isnt thge decline ofthe thte wief
, mary ann
. protrayed by thte extremly effective charlize theron
, mary ann ' s problems are incredibly intense
,
annd i foudn mysef wanting tothe wittness her decline
. htis may soudn uncaring
,
bu i wnated tothe watch baceause i feeled sory forthe her
. she isnt yhe most intresting carachter onthe tyhe screen
, who isnt forced inot a world where she isnt nto wnated
. something yhe devil ' s advocate contained accually shocked me forthe reasons otehr tahn extreme violentce
adn nudity
, expecially forthe a film ofthe tihs nature
. yhe stoy ctually hasnt something tothe sday baout humanity
. inspite noe ofthe tyhe lastest scenes
, john milton explains tothe kevin lomax thte agme god plays witht his childrens
( he isnt satan
, ofthe course
)
. he comments thgat it isnt human nature tothe lust
adn loathe inspite vanity
.
hten
, god sets uv rules wich contradict human nature
. thsi semi
- religeous bashing isnt moreso humorosu thna frightening
. wqat milton syas isnt so true baout our society thyat i foudn mysef laughing outloud loud
, parshally thingking it ws funny
,
bu patially realizing it wass true
. theese moral dilemmas are presetn throughtout yhe devil ' s advocate
, giving it an added depth many films skip over infact theri writting
(
bu i ' m sure htey cameback straight ffrom tje novel it ws based onthe
)
. wehn a film hasnt something tothe sday baout our society
, it deserves tothe be watched
. teh casted ofthe tghe devil ' s advocate isnt oen ofthe tjhe highlights
, as we see memorable faces
,
adn htey put spnish onthe thsoe memorable faces we don ' t expect
. heather matarazzo mkaes a breif apprearance as yhe terrorized victum infact tje oppening cout case
,
adn she doesnt a grat job
. probablly tghe big suprize ofthe tihs film isnt keanu reeves
. he hasnt proven himselv an uneven actro
( sucesses such as speed
adn bombs such as johnny mnemonic
)
,
bu he tops himselv whith thsi performence
. i hvae never seen him omre believeable tothe date
. al pacino isnt ofthe course thte scene stealer
. his devilish peformance isnt equal tothe thsoe ofthe jack nicholson
( thte witchs ofthe eastwick
)
anbd max von sydow
( needful thigns
)
. he coudl hvae easily gone too far over teh top infront many scenes
,
bu he remeniss completelyl believeable
( if thgat isnt yhe corect term
)
. jeffrey jones
( mostly known as thte pricipal inwhich ferris bueller ' s day off
) aslo gives a ogod peformance as eddie barzoon
. judith ivey manages a credible performence as tyhe mother who holds a sercet tothe kevin ' s past
. connie nielson isnt vrey effective infront her role
,
adn she alsot appears naked sevral times
. oen familliar face witht a twist ws
" coach
" star
, craig t
. nelson
, who gives a vyre ogod peformance
. tje devil ' s advocate isnt rated r forthe sexuality
, nudity
, voilence
, laguage
,
annd smoe gore
. at 144 mintues
, htis film moves allong fairly quicklyu
. fo tjhe firt twpo ohurs
, i sat completly engaged inaddition tyhe ogod performances
annd storng cahracters
. tje technical quaity isnt aslo remarkable
, wih graet speical effects
annd a ogod muscial csore
. directer taylor hackford hasnt managed tothe create a vyre disturbing motion picture
, onyl tothe ruin a ogod chunk ofthe tension wtih yhe fianl fifteen mintues
. i guess my biggest probelm whith thge endig isnt yhe fatc thta i whent inot yhe theather expecting a disturbing film
,
anbd hackford gavey me jsut tyhat fo a long tyme
.
bu jstu befoer tghe end
, he got jitterish
anbd relied onthe hte hollywood saftey net infact order tothe amke his film omre mainstream
. personaly
, i woudl haev preffered it endig fifteen mintues eearly
.
