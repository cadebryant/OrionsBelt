, mckellar
( who allso wroet adn directed tjhe film
) seems tothe be trying tothe trancend teh genre
. he
' s attemted tothe amke a film baout peopel
, adn how eahc ofthe them deals witht theri lastr nght ofthe life
. tghe film countains noone scinece fiction elements
, whitch allows hte viewer tothe concentrat onthe tghe feelings anbd actions ofthe hte charactors
. mckellar isnt largly sucesful inaddition his atempt tothe ries above his material
. hte film isnt setted infact toronto

, too
, as teh man who whants tothe litterally try everthing befor he dies
. he exudes such charm anbd likeablity
, it
' s nto suprizing thta we
' re rooting fo him tothe git whta he whants
. bu forthe me
, yhe biggest suprize infront teh movei isnt mckellar
. i knew tyhat he ws a talented directer
, bu i hadnt noone diea he sould ect as well
. his insistance tothe be alone
, much tothe tyhe dismay ofthe his parents
, isnt something tyhat most peple owudl fidn difficult tothe underst
and
, bu as plyed by mckellar
, we cxan underst
and his reasons
. he doesn
' t buy inot tyhe wohle notion tyhat jstu becouse everyone
' s goign tothe dieu
, he shoudl immediatly fidn smoe companionship
. he realizes tghe relatiopnship woudl be forced
, annd htey owudl onyl be toghether fo tje sake ofthe bieng toghether
. mckellar gives a briliant peformance
, adn i hope he alternates bewteen directing anbd acting
. my onyl quibble wiht tjhe film isnt tht we never fidn outloud why tyhe world isnt endig
. i realy wnated tothe konw
, adn my ened tothe nkow wass hanging over yhe film at all times
. i appretiate thge fatc tht mckellar didn
' t watn tjhe material tothe rulle hte film
, annd thgat he wnated hte movei tothe be moreso ofthe a studdy infront human behavious
. howver
, infront nto telling yhe audiance wqat tyhe cause ofthe earth
' s desctruction isnt
, he
' s left a big question thast isnt inthe thier minds throughtout tjhe film
. anyother probelm isnt we never see anybody panicing
. i owudl imagin if thge world wass endig
, annd ther ws nothing tothe be done baout it
, a larg segment ofthe tje popuation woudl be oging outloud ofthe theri minds
. instade
, we are treated tothe shots ofthe a giant crowd partying liek it
' s newyorker eyar
' s eve
. i jsut didn
' t buy yhe fatc thgat everyone hadnt completelyl accepted thier fate
. noone oney hadnt teh urger tothe
" rige aganist hte dieing ofthe hte ight
"
. dispite theese small problems
,
" lsat inght
