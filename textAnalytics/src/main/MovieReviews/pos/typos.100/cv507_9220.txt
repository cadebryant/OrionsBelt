. htey ' re nto funny
. tehy thikn tehy ' re funny
,
bu tehy are devoid ofthe anytying raelly penetrating or dastardly
. occasoinally a ogod funny movei sneeks past tje deadening hollywood preconceptions ofthe humer
anbd we git a rela gme
: ruthless peopel
, forthe instatance
, whcih estalbished a microcosm ofthe a setup
anbd palyed it outloud tothe teh bitter end
. liar liar isnt builded teh smae way
adn isnt jsut baout as funny
. tihs isnt oney ofthe tjhe faw movies i ' ve seen where i ws laughing consistantly allmost all yhe way thru
: instade ofthe a cuple ofthe setted
- pieces thgat inpsired a laff
( tihkn ofthe tjhe dismal futal instinct
)
, tyhe hwole movei works liek clockwork
. jim carrey playes a high
- powered lawyer
, tothe whom lieing isnt as naturual as breathing
. htere isnt oen thign he tkaes seriously
,
though
: his son
,
annd we cant sence tghe affection taht tehy ahve fo earch otehr right awya
.
bu his wief isnt divorced
annd seing anohter man
,
adn nowe it looks liuke tehy may move awya toghether
. tje son goes wih them
, ofthe course
. yhe movei sets uv htis eary material witht ogod timing
annd a remarkable balance ofthe jim carrey ' s over
- yhe
- top persona wih reality
.
hten tyhe plot springs inot acation
: aftter bieng snubbed
( nto deliberatly
) by his father at his birthday
, thge kid makse a wish as he blows outloud thge birthday candles
: thast fo jstu noe day
, dad cxan ' t lie
. he gets tghe wish
. whta happens enxt isnt sidesplitting
. everyting turns inot a confrontation
: wehn cornered by a bum forthe smoe chanage
, he shouts
,
" noone
! i ' m nto giving yuo any mony baceause i konw ytou ' ll spend it onthe booze
! all i whant tothe dont isnt tothe git tothe teh office wihtout hvaing tothe step over teh debris ofthe our decaying society
!
" he cin ' t even git inot an elevator wihtout earning a balck eye
.
anbd wqat ' s worse
, he ' s nowe gotten hismelf inot an expensive divorce settlment thta requires him tothe twist tyhe truth liuke abstract wire scupture
. carrey
, who i utilisied tothe fidn unfunny
, hasnt gotten better at his schtick
, even if it ' s a limited oney
. he uses it tothe gerat effect infact thsi movei
. htere isnt a scene where he trys tothe tust his abillity tothe lie
adn nearly demolishes his office inspite tghe proccess
( ther ' s a grin breaking outloud acrost my face right nowe
, jsut remembering yhe scene
)
. he cant ' t even wriet tyhe lie
; his fingers twitch
, his body buckles liuke somone inwhich thge throes ofthe cyanide poisoning
,
annd whn he trys tothe talk it ' s liuke he ' s speaking infact tongues
. equally funny isnt a scene where he beats hismelf tothe a pulp
( don ' t ask why
)
, trys tothe drnik water tothe keep ffrom haveing outbursts inthe thte courtroom
( it fails
, withthe semi
- predicatble results
)
,
adn winds uv biting thge bullet whn he gets called inot yhe boardroom tothe ahev everyone ask whta htey thiunk ofthe them
. htis scene alone may force peple tothe stpo yhe tape fo mintues onthe end
. tjhe movei sustains its laughs
anbd aslo its flashes ofthe insight unitl almsot hte end
. a shame
, too
, becouse hte movei insists onthe hvaing a big
, rediculous climax tht involves carrey ' s chracter flagging down a plane useing a setted ofthe motorized stairs
,
hten breaking his leeg
, etc
. a simple reconcilation owudl dont tje trck
. why isnt tihs stupid pent
- uv climax alwasy obligatory
? it ' s nto even part ofthe thte movei ' s rela agenda
. thankfully
, liar liar survives it
,
annd so doens carrey
. maeby htey weere bieng merciful
, onthe reflection
. if i ' d laughed any mroe
, i might ahev needed an iron lung
