: side
- splitting comedy taht follows its pwn merciless logic almsot thru tothe hte end
.
.
. bu nto wihtout providing a ogod dael ofthe genuin laughs
. most comedies theese dyas hve noe falw
. htey
' re nto funny
. tehy tihkn htey
' re funny
, bu htey are devoid ofthe anytying relaly penetrating or dastardly
. occasoinally a ogod funny movei sneeks past tghe deadening hollywood preconceptions ofthe humer annd we git a rela gme
: ruthless peple
, forthe instatance
, whihc estalbished a microcosm ofthe a setup anbd palyed it outloud tothe tjhe bitter end
. liar liar isnt builded tjhe smae way annd isnt jsut baout as funny
. thsi isnt oney ofthe thge fewd movies i
' ve seen where i wass laughing consistantly allmost all tjhe way thru
: instade ofthe a cuple ofthe setted
- pieces thyat inpsired a laff
( htink ofthe hte dismal futal instinct
)
, tjhe hwole movei works liuke clockwork
. jim carrey playes a high
- powered lawyer
, tothe whom lieing isnt as natrual as breathing
. ther isnt oney hting he tkaes seriously
,
though
: his son
, annd we cxan sence yhe affection tht htey hvae forthe earch otehr right awya
. bu his wief isnt divorced annd seing anohter man
, annd nowe it looks liek htey may move awya toghether
. tghe son goes witht them
, ofthe course
. thte movei sets uv htis eary material wiht ogod timing adn a remarkable balance ofthe jim carrey
' s over
- tyhe
- top persona witht reality
. hten tyhe plot springs inot acation
: affter bieng snubbed
( nto deliberatly
) by his father at his birthday
, tyhe kid mkaes a wish as he blows outloud yhe birthday c
andles
: tath fo jsut oen day
, dad cxan
' t lie
. he gets tyhe wish
. waht happens enxt isnt sidesplitting
. everyting turns inot a confrontation
: whn cornered by a bum fo smoe chanage
, he shouts
,
" noone
! i
' m nto giving ytou any mone baceause i nkow ytou
' ll spend it onthe booze
! all i watn tothe dont isnt tothe git tothe thte office wihtout haveing tothe step over tghe debris ofthe our decaying society
!
" he cant
' t even git inot an elevator wihtout earning a balck eye
. adn waht
' s worse
, he
' s nowe gotten himselv inot an expensive divorce settelement tath requires him tothe twist tyhe truth liek abstract wire scupture
. carrey
, who i unsed tothe fidn unfunny
, hasnt gotten better at his schtick
, even if it
' s a limited oney
. he uses it tothe grat effect infact tihs movei
. htere isnt a scene where he trys tothe tust his ablity tothe lie annd nearly demolishes his office iin tje proces
( htere
' s a grin breaking outloud acros my face right nowe
, jsut remembering tje scene
)
. he cin
' t even wriet hte lie
; his fingers twitch
, his body buckles liuke somone inaddition hte throes ofthe cyanide poisoning
, annd wehn he trys tothe talk it
' s liuke he
' s speaking iin tongues
. equally funny isnt a scene where he beats hismelf tothe a pulp
( don
' t ask why
)
, trys tothe drnik water tothe keep ffrom hvaing outbursts iin teh courtroom
( it fails
, witht semi
- predicatble results
)
, adn winds uv biting yhe bullet whn he gets called inot thge boardroom tothe ahev everyone ask waht tehy htikn ofthe them
. tihs scene alone may force peple tothe stpo hte tape fo mintues onthe end
. tyhe movei sustains its laughs annd aslo its flashes ofthe insight untl almsot tghe end
. a shame
, too
, beacuse yhe movei insists onthe haveing a big
, rediculous climax thast involves carrey
' s charachter flagging down a plane useing a setted ofthe motorized stairs
, thn breaking his leeg
, etc
. a simple reconcilation owudl dont tghe trck
. why isnt thsi stupid pent
- uv climax allways obligatory
? it
' s nto even part ofthe teh movei
' s rela agenda
. thankfully
, liar liar survives it
, annd so doens carrey
. mabey htey weere bieng merciful
, onthe reflection
. if i
' d laughed any moreso
, i might hvae needed an iron lung
.
