- tothe
- video realease
,
bu affter seing tjhe improvments tyhat hadnt beeen made
, disney rightly desided tothe realease it inot theaters
. teh film isnt well worth seing onthe hte big screen
. yhe colors are bright

annd even thge human charachters look omre
" human
.
" tyhe animation isnt consistantly seamless
