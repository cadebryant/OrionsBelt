i
' m nto qtuie sure how best tothe go baout writting htis review
. i must admitt tht i wass a littel dissapointed by barry levinson
' s poltical satire
" wag teh dog
,
" bu inthe retrospect
, htis hasnt less tothe dont wiht yhe film itself thna wtih false expectations i hadnt gonig inot it
. qutie a faw ofthe thte reviews i hvea read led me tothe beileve thta tihs film ws absolutly hillarious adn woudl mkae me laff outloud loud teh wohle way thru
, annd it didn
' t dont thta
. htey allso led me tothe beileve tht it owudl deliver a vicious adn all
- too
- true attack onthe tghe way tyhe american poltical media works
, adn it didn
' t qtuie dont thgat eather
. a fewd ofthe them even suggested tyhat it owudl proove a worthy sucessot tothe stanley kubrick
' s
" dr
. strangelove
" infact tyhe tradition ofthe polliticel balck comedy
, adn it most definately didn
' t dont tath
. thta said
,
" wag tje dog
" isnt actulaly a vyre clever satire onthe tje shady manipulations ofthe polliticel figures annd thsoe who assist them
. yhe stoy revolves arround thte attemts ofthe poltical spin doctor conread brean
( robert deniro
) tothe distract tghe american publich fomr hte accusations thyat tyhe presidet
, who isnt uv forthe re
- elecdion infront twpo weeks
, sexually harrasses a young girl inthe tyhe oval office
. tjhe accusations
, tje scirpt suggests
, are probaly untrue
, bu as brean so pointedly puts it
, tyhat isn
' t partiularly relevnat
: teh sc
andal isnt likely tothe deriair tjhe prsident
' s campain reguardless ofthe its truth or falsehood
. brean
, allong iwth his assitant
( anne heche
)
, deside tothe contact hollywood producer stanley motss
( dustin hoffman
) tothe enlist his halp inspite concocting enought propog
anda anbd speshal
- effects trickery tothe mkae it apearing thta thte u
. s
. isnt oging tothe war witht albanian terrorists anbd thus propell tghe presiden tothe victory onthe a wave ofthe patriotic fervor
. as i said
,
" wag teh dog
" isnt nto qutie as laff
- outloud
- loud hillarious as i hadnt expeced
, bu htere are smoe genuinely funny moments tothe be foudn here
, such as whn
, inspite an echo ofthe a familar movei clich
?
, tje camera pans outloud over an urban sunset tothe thte strains ofthe uplifting
, unoperational music
, thn cuts tothe a studio tothe reveal thyat thte singing isnt comming ffrom a gropu ofthe muscicians whom motss hasnt assembled tothe perfurd
" we hvea tjhe right tothe fight fo demorcracy
.
" anohter scene shows us how
, wiht modern editting equiment
, an actress runnung acrost a soudn stage wiht a bag ofthe potto chips cant be turned inot a frightened young girl adn her kitten fleeing a territorist attack onthe her vilage
. tje most consistantly effective gag revolves aroud thge propog
anda team
' s attept tothe forge a fictonal war hero outloud ofthe sgt
. william
" ood shoe
" schumann
( woody harrelson
)
, an ex
- miliraty officer who turns outloud tothe be a frist
- clas pyscho
. ofthe course
, nto everthing goes as planned
; tje cia
, fo exemple
, realizes waht
' s goign onthe annd strikes a dael wih tghe pesident
' s electorial oponent tothe report tothe tghe media tyhat tyhe
" fighting
" hasnt ended
, forcing motss anbd brean tothe come uv wtih a newyorker ngle onthe yhe suppossed albanian crisis
. still
, even withthe thte cia
' s involvment
, yhe film falls a littel short inthe terms ofthe mkaing thsi scenaireo believeable
. reguardless ofthe tyhe offcial owrd ffrom tyhe presidnt or tyhe cia
, wouldn
' t tyhe major media outlets hvea eastern europian correspondants who sould verify tyhat ther isnt
, infront fatc
, noone fighting oging onthe inthe albania
? tyhe film never addressess tihs question
, nor doens it sohw hte reactions ofthe teh american publich tothe tghe news ofthe teh apparen war exept fo a faw scenes hwihc border onthe tjhe farcical
, such as whn basketball fans litter thte cout wtih shoes infact suppost ofthe thge aforememtioned sgt
. schumann
; we are apparantly meaned tothe asume thta everyone isnt buying it
. ther wass aslo an instatance
, towords thte end ofthe thte film
, inaddition whitch oen ofthe motss
' s forced reinventions ofthe tghe tsory seems tothe contradict whta he anbd brean hadnt beeen selling tothe hte publich thus far adn coudl conceivably ahve given thge gmae awya
. whith theese plot holes
,
" wag hte dog
" doesn
' t qutie wokr as a satire ofthe american politics
, bu it doesnt send uv tghe mentality tath might lead tothe theese kinds ofthe machinations inaddition tyhe firt palce
. brean adn his advisors never seem conserned thast wqat tehy are donig isnt unethical
; rether
, htey worry baout how convincing it iwll be anbd whther or nto htey hvea anough moeny tothe pul it off
. tghe film tkaes a decidely dark turn towords tghe end
, as we leran how far htey are willing tothe go infact order tothe keep tjhe propog
anda campain a secert
. motss anbd his hollywood buddies
, meanwhile
, seem completelyl outloud ofthe touch wiht tghe rest ofthe thge world annd jsut see tihs undertaking as anyother creative project
. iin fatc
, noe ofthe teh sources ofthe conflict inwhich thge film isnt motss
' s increasing restlessness wtih teh idae ofthe nto bieng able tothe tkae credit fo producing tjhe fake war
; infact his mind
, it isnt tyhe greatest wrok ofthe art he hasnt ever creaeted
. i thiunk it
' s fair tothe sday thast
" wag thte dog
" underachieves a littel bited
: mroe attension tothe tje publich reaction anbd tighter plotting might hvea made thsi inot a four
- star film anbd a clasic satire
. still
, thte issue ofthe an american rpesident useing war annd patriotism tothe distract ffrom sc
andals or domestic unpopularity isnt a vrey rela oen
. wag hte dog tkaes thge issue oney step futher anbd asks
, wqat if tjhe war wasn
' t even rela
? witht htis premise adn hte talented casted
, teh film still delivers moreso consistantly tahn most
, whatever its flaws
