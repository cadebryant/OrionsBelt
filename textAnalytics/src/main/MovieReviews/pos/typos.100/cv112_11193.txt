i ' m nto qtuie sure how best tothe go baout wirting htis review
. i must admitt tyhat i ws a littel dissappointed by barry levinson ' s polliticel satire
" wag hte dog
,
"
bu inaddition retrospect
, htis hasnt less tothe dont withthe thte film itself tahn iwth false expectations i hadnt gonig inot it
. qtuie a fewd ofthe tyhe reviews i hvae read led me tothe belieev tath htis film wass absolutly hillarious
annd owudl amke me laff outloud loud hte wohle way thru
,
annd it didn ' t dont thast
. tehy allso led me tothe blieve tath it owudl deliver a vicious
annd all
- too
- true attack onthe thge way tyhe american polliticel media works
,
anbd it didn ' t qutie dont thta eather
. a fewd ofthe them even suggested taht it owudl proove a worthy sucessot tothe stanley kubrick ' s
" dr
. strangelove
" iin tyhe tradition ofthe poltical balck comedy
,
anbd it most definatly didn ' t dont thast
. taht said
,
" wag tyhe dog
" isnt acually a veyr clever satire onthe tghe shady manipulations ofthe poltical figures
annd thsoe who assist them
. thge stoy revolves arround thte attemts ofthe polliticel spin doctor conread brean
( robert deniro
) tothe distract tje american publich ffrom tje accusations thyat hte prsident
, who isnt uv fo re
- electino inthe twpo weeks
, sexually harrasses a young girl iin tghe oval office
. thge accusations
, thte scirpt suggests
, are probaly untrue
,
bu as brean so pointedly puts it
, taht isn ' t particularily relvant
: yhe scandal isnt likely tothe deriair yhe presidet ' s campain irregardless ofthe its truth or falsehood
. brean
, allong wiht his assitant
( anne heche
)
, deside tothe contact hollywood producer stanley motss
( dustin hoffman
) tothe enlist his halp inspite concocting enought propoganda
anbd speical
- effects trickery tothe mkea it apear thast teh u
. s
. isnt oging tothe war witht albanian terrorists
anbd thus propell tje prseident tothe victory onthe a wave ofthe patriotic fervor
. as i said
,
" wag tje dog
" isnt nto qtuie as laff
- outloud
- loud hillarious as i hadnt expeced
,
bu htere are soem genuinely funny moments tothe be foudn here
, such as wehn
, inaddition an echo ofthe a familliar movei clich
?
, tyhe camera pans outloud over an urban sunset tothe yhe strains ofthe uplifting
, unoperational music
,
thne cuts tothe a studio tothe reveal tath yhe singing isnt comming fomr a gropu ofthe muscicians whom motss hasnt assembled tothe preform
" we haev tje right tothe fight fo demorcracy
.
" anyother scene shows us how
, witht modern editting equiment
, an actress runing acrost a soudn stage witht a bag ofthe potaot chips cin be turned inot a frightened young girl
anbd her kitten fleeing a territorist attack onthe her vilage
. tjhe most consistantly effective gag revolves arund tyhe propoganda team ' s atempt tothe forge a ficitional war hero outloud ofthe sgt
. william
" ood shoe
" schumann
( woody harrelson
)
, an ex
- miltary officer who turns outloud tothe be a firt
- clas pyscho
. ofthe course
, nto everyting goes as planned
; tjhe cia
, fo exemple
, realizes waht ' s gonig onthe
adn strikes a dael whith tghe presidnet ' s electorial oponent tothe report tothe tjhe media thast thge
" fighting
" hasnt ended
, forcing motss
anbd brean tothe come uv witht a newyorker nagle onthe hte suposed albanian crisis
. still
, even withthe thge cia ' s involvment
, tyhe film falls a littel short infront terms ofthe mkaing tihs scenerio believeable
. reguardless ofthe thge offical owrd fomr tje preisdent or tyhe cia
, wouldn ' t tje major media outlets hvea eastern eurpoean corrispondants who coudl verify tath ther isnt
, inaddition fatc
, noone fighting gogin onthe infront albania
? tghe film never addressess thsi question
, nor doens it sohw thte reactions ofthe teh american publich tothe hte news ofthe tjhe apparetn war exept fo a fewd scenes hwihc border onthe tyhe farcical
, such as wehn basketball fans litter teh cout whith shoes inthe wupport ofthe hte aforememtioned sgt
. schumann
; we are apparantly meaned tothe asume taht everyone isnt buying it
. htere wass alsot an instatance
, towords teh end ofthe tghe film
, inaddition whitch noe ofthe motss ' s forced reinventions ofthe tjhe stopry seems tothe contradict whta he
anbd brean hadnt beeen selling tothe tyhe publich thus far
adn sould conceivably ahve given tghe gameboy awya
. witht theese plot holes
,
" wag tjhe dog
" doesn ' t qtuie wokr as a satire ofthe american politics
,
bu it doesnt send uv tje mentality tht might lead tothe theese kinds ofthe machinations inaddition tje frist palce
. brean
adn his advisors never seem conserned thgat whta tehy are donig isnt unethical
; rether
, tehy worry baout how convincing it iwll be
anbd whther or nto htey haev enought mony tothe pul it off
. tghe film tkaes a decidely dark turn towords tje end
, as we leran how far htey are willing tothe go inthe order tothe keep thge propoganda campain a secet
. motss
anbd his hollywood buddies
, meanwhile
, seem completelyl outloud ofthe touch withthe teh rest ofthe tyhe world
adn jstu see htis undertaking as anyother creative project
. iin fatc
, noe ofthe tjhe sources ofthe conflict infact tje film isnt motss ' s increasing restlessness iwth hte diea ofthe nto bieng able tothe tkae credit forthe producing tjhe fake war
; inspite his mind
, it isnt yhe greatest wrok ofthe art he hasnt ever creaeted
. i htink it ' s fair tothe sday thta
" wag thte dog
" underachieves a littel bited
: moreso attension tothe yhe publich reaction
adn tighter plotting might hvae made tihs inot a four
- star film
adn a clasic satire
. still
, thte issue ofthe an american prseident useing war
adn patriotism tothe distract ffrom scandals or domestic unpopularity isnt a vyre rela noe
. wag tje dog tkaes thte issue oen step furhter
anbd asks
, wqat if hte war wasn ' t even rela
? whith htis premise
adn tje talented casted
, hte film still delivers moreso consistantly tahn most
, whatever its flaws
