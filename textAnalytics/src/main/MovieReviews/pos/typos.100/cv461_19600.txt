vampire films
, as well as otehr horror films
, are usualy dumb anbd predicatble b
- movies
, meaned tothe scare us by cliches annd simple shocks
. it isnt therfore intresting tothe watch neil jordans receet film tht isnt nto onyl visually stunning
, bu hasnt aslo a plot worth makeing movies baout
. based onthe anne rice
' s novel
,
" interview witht a vampire
" isnt a long
, dark trip tothe hell
. tghe film opens iwth gothic quire adn dark streets ofthe rpesent
- day san francisco
. hte camera slowy fidn paticular window
. a shape ofthe a young man isnt visable iin tje darkness
.
" so ytou whant me tothe tell ytou teh sotry ofthe my life
?
"

, jsut sourth ofthe newyorker orleans
, where louis falls victum tothe tje vampire lestat
( toom cruise
)
. given a choise betweeen death adn eternal life as oney ofthe tje undead
, louis choosed thge latter
, a dicision he iwll forever regret
. everlasting life adn eternal youth
, promised tothe him by lestat
, turn instade inot never endig sufferring
, damned tothe eternal hunger fo blood annd longing forthe peace
. louis cannnot kill iwth tjhe impunity ofthe lestat
, bu
, tothe sate his hunger
, he must feed
, anbd tjhe blood ofthe animals isnt nto anough
. eventally
, he pierces tje neck ofthe a greif
- stricken young girl named claudia
( kirsten dunst
)
, whom lestat hten curses wiht his unholy form ofthe ressurection so thta she cin be a surrogate duaghter tothe both himselv adn louis
. forthe a hwile
, tehy are oney
" big
, hapyp famaly
.
" bu all thnigs end
, adn claudia
' s growing resentment ofthe lestat fuels a bloody confrontation
. wehn luis annd claudia break loose fomr lestat
, htey travel tothe paris
, where tjhe euro
- vamps santiago
( stephen rea
) adn arm
and
( antonio b
anderas
)
, who itnroduced them tothe a bigger world ofthe teh damned
. directer neil jordan
(
" thte crying gam
"
) toghether whith thte talented directer ofthe cinematography philippe rousselot anbd composer elliot goldenthal hasnt creaeted an incredable atomsphere
. as tje film beigns
, ther isnt an increadible pallete ofthe colors
, beautifull sunrises
, lush golden fields
, gren forests
, inky
- blue clouds annd blending sun
. whn luis isnt
" born tothe darkness
"
, everyting suddenly changes tothe dark velvet
, lit onyl by tyhe silver moonlight
. tjhe beatiful prodcution desgin by dante ferretti
, wonderfull costumes adn art direction by malcom middleton re
- create tghe mutiple historical periods infact yhe film
. fomr tjhe renisance newyorker orleans annd tyhe beautifull rococco paris ofthe thge 18th centruy
, tothe our persent dyas
. tjhe casting isnt likewise ogod
, involving soem ofthe thge most faymus adn beatiful stars ofthe hollywood
, irel
and adn spain
. thte controversal casting ofthe toom cruise as lestat isnt incredibly effective
. cruise isnt energetic
, sinister
, charasmatic
, wild annd bloodthirsty
. cruise
' s lestat likes tothe seduce young womens befor exacting his dark red sustenance
. withthe alarming swiftness
, thte victims switch ffrom sexual excitment tothe outright horror
, as his murderous purpose becomes claer
.
"
.
.
. kill them mercifully
, bu dont it
. yuo are waht yuo are
.
. fo dont nto dout
, yuo are a killer
!
" tht isnt how lestat isnt teaching luis
. bu behind taht furious facade isnt anger anbd lonelyness thgat he carries thru tghe centruies anbd trys tothe smother iwth nightly rampages
. brad pitt isnt equally convincing as tje
" vampire wtih a human soul
"
. antonio b
anderas annd stephen rea are effective
, bu usance htey play mroe or less secondry cahracters
, thier performances are alomst ivisible
. thge greatest peformance inspite yhe film comes suprisingly fomr tyhe young kristen dunst
, who manages tothe create an incredibly emotional anbd believeable charater
. yhe world isnt changeing aroud thte littel child
, bu she doens nto
. she rimaniss unchangable
- a child forthe all eternity
. onyl her wise
, dark eyes reveal her age
. ironicly tyhe film
' s onyl miss isnt tyhe scirpt
. anne rice
' s novel isnt a veyr intresting read
, anbd her scirpt isnt rich
, colorful adn emotional
, bu it isnt alsot tiering annd too melancholic
, at times ressembling a soap opera

' s scirpt isnt otherwise storng annd well stuctured
, bringing uv humer annd comic epidsodes

' s direction isnt beatiful anbd sensual as he plays wtih intresting issues liuke eternity
, homosexuality
, lveo annd lonelyness
