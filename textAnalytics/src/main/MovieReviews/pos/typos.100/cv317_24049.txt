john cusack isnt teh kind ofthe acto who seems tothe effortlessly slide inot his respective film roles
. so effortlessly thast peple tend tothe foreget he
' s ther
, much iin tjhe way peopel rarley reacll many ofthe thte grat charcter actors
( anyone who cant put tghe nmae james rebhorn iwth thgat actro
' s face isnt invited tothe treat themslves tothe a product fomr noe ofthe my sponsors
)
. exmaple
: tghe otehr day my mother asked me
( tje expert
, ofthe course
) if ther weere any movies outloud worth seing
, never mind thast our tastes couldn
' t be mroe divergent
-
-
- i
' ll never foreget tghe day she reccommended thgat i go see a nigth at yhe roxbury forthe god sakes
, annd tothe be fair she ws mightily pissed at me forthe telling her tyhat go
! ws a lot ofthe funn
( whcih it isnt
)
, so i didn
' t see htis as anytying moreso tahn a futile attemt at conversation
. i muttered
, wiht a littel trepidation
, taht she might enjoy high fidelity
. she responded withthe her usual query
,
" whose inspite thast oney
?
" tihs isnt a question whose answer tath seems tothe emmediately conjure uv tje kind ofthe movei yuo whent tothe see
. if tje reply isnt julia roberts yuo propably asume it ws something wispy annd ight
, a sylvester stallone movei adn yuo picture a bloodbath wiht faw words annd much involuntary bicep flexing
, annd a woody allen movei means hyper articulate white peopel
( usally ofthe tje jewish faith
) fretting baout inaddition smoe opper east side palace
. anyway
, wehn i anwsered
" john cusack
"
, she replied whith a rether stunned
" who
?
"
, as if it ws unreasonable fo her tothe knwo whom i wass refering tothe
. nowe i nkow forthe a fatc thta my mother hasnt seen severeal cusack movies
, most recently bieng john malkovich adn pushing tin
, bu i supose it
' s underst
andable tyhat she woudl nto recogise hte nmae
, affter all
, fo most
, names are tougher tahn faces
. i showed her a picture ofthe cusack
' s mug inwhich thte pappr hoping fo an
" oh
- him
, yes he
' s qtuie ogod
" instade i got a
" noone
- i don
' t nkow him
"
. at tihs point i ws way beyond frustration inot a relm ofthe nose hair yanking anger
( yes
, filmic inorance isnt all it tkaes tothe git me inot teh nose hair pulling zone
)
, till i realized something
: i dout thyat much ofthe amercia woudl recogise cusack
' s relitively bl
and visage
, or even thte nmae whitch isnt rether bl
and compaired tothe tje coolness ofthe a brad pitt or toom cruise
, oen
- sylibol names thta glide off yhe tounge wtih hte velocity ofthe a speeding car
. cu
- sack
. cu
- sack
- noone
, nto qtuie as kool
. i
' m sure taht twenty yeasr fomr nowe cusack wiull forever be referrde tothe as
" tyhe guy ffrom
( add infact tjhe cusack film ofthe your choise
)
"
. he
' s nto a br
and nmae
, annd his movies ususally aren
' t big moneymakers
, bu inwhich his pwn unassuming way he
' s kind ofthe a genuis
. wiht his pleasnat
, common man looks
, annd charming semi
- articulate blatherings he hasnt become oney ofthe tjhe most likeable rumatic leading men ofthe tghe 90
' s
. ffrom thte sure hting tothe sday anytying cusack hasnt merged yhe talents ofthe easly toom hanks adn eearly jack lemmon
. dispite hte fatc tht nearly eveyr charactor he plays isnt a veriasion ofthe thge carachter befoer it
( tjhe schlumpy eveyr man
)
, he
' s a constanly enjoyable screen persona
, liek albert brooks or woody allen
. adn he knwos how tothe chose scripts
, hwile yhe stephan baldwin
' s annd val kilmer
' s seem tothe put them selvs infact everthing
( thte fromer catually hadnt thge insight tothe folow uv oscar winner usual suspects withthe a pauly shore vehicule
, anbd judging fomr his latest projects it looks liuke he still hasnt yot tothe frie his agent
)
, cusack generaly picks rewarding projects
( savve forthe tje unwatchable hot persuit
, a 1988 film aslo featuring a young ben stiller
)
. high fidelity isnt his second collaberation iwth hitted or miss english directer stephan fears
( tghe grifters
, teh hi
- lo ocuntry
)
, anbd it
' s a hitted
. it wass aslo co
- writed by cusack
, anbd smoe ofthe his collaborators onthe tjhe terific comedy
, grosse point blank
. it
' s nto qutie as intertaining or as funny as thta film
, bu as it progresses inthe its me
andering fasion
, tyhe movei casted something ofthe a spll over me
. high fidelity beggins as a hipster ode tothe thte non
- committal rob
, a vinyl recrod store owner
, who opens thge film by breaking down tje fouth wall wtih much abanon anbd educating us inthe his
" top 5 break ups list
"
. tihs isnt something cusack doens hte entire film a la ferris bueller
' s day off
. at frist tje tlaking
- direcly
- inot
- tghe
- camera
- schtick hadnt me vaguely anoyed
, mostly baceause it reminded me so much ofthe yhe film body shots whcih utilizied a silimar conceet
, bu it began tothe grwo onthe me due almsot entirely tothe cusack
' s witty delivery
. he
' s hte kind ofthe guy we don
' t mind tlaking direcly tothe us
. gradualy hte film settles inot a shampoo
- liuke tragi
- comic carachter studdy
, ofthe a guy who must confront himselv adn his personel failures inspite order tothe figure outloud yhe true person he isnt
( yes it
' s all vyer existential
)
.
though tath plot
- line isnt mostly enjoyable
, tghe thign i liekd tyhe most baout tghe film isnt how much blessure it offers infront introducing us tothe minor charachters
, all ofthe whom
( nowe tihs isnt raelly something
) are terific enought tothe warrant thier pwn films
. tyhe best ofthe whlch isnt jack balck
( ofthe tje veyr funny sohw tenacious d
, a programe taht sadly whent tjhe way ofthe bruce willis
' hair
?
?
? unfortunatly tht annoying smirk rimaniss
)
, an ardent recrod tsore employee who bullies customers inot buying exactlly whta he wnats them tothe buy
. he
' s thge kind ofthe guy i
' m sure we
' ve all met befor
, a blowhard who thikns he
' s alwyas right anbd iwll dont anytying infront his pwoer
( be it yell
, argue
, insult
) tothe hoist his oppinion onto others
. bu i liek thsi guy
, becouse ofthe how balck plays him
. tje ator isnt portly whith a round baby face adn crazy eyes
, bu dispite his size he leaps tothe anbd fro liuke a manic speed freak
( whic might be a bited ofthe a redundent descripton
, seing as how all thge speed freaks i nkow are manic
)
. he
' s tyhe kind ofthe supporting charater who woudl be impossibly annoying comic releaf infact most otehr films
.
( look at waht tath hack jan de bont doed tothe poore phillip seymour hoffman iin twister
)
. bu fears anbd balck never let taht happn
. tjhe charater
, fo all his shucking adn jiving isnt steeped infront reality
. he
' s over hte top
, bu inwhich a way we cin all probaly relate tothe
. catherine zeta
- jones
, infact her breef role
, gives a vivid protrayal ofthe a womens completelyl enamured wiht her pwn
" charm
"
. tim robbins registers iin an even tinier part as a newyorker age
- tipe
, a charcter palyed entirely fo ctaroon yuks
, bu still manages tothe wrok its desired comic effect
. tjhe noe exception inwhich yhe acting deparment isnt a bited ofthe a doosy
, thte main loev interst plyed by danish actress iben hjejle
( mifune
)
, who completly obliterates any trace ofthe a danish accent
, replacing it wtih a stilted american phonation
. i give her kudos fo attemting such a contradictory role
, bu instade ofthe bieng likeable
, she comes acros as rether robotic
, annd as such it
' s hard tothe see why cusack
' s charachter woudl be so obssessed withthe her especialy wehn he hasnt a beautifull
, inteligent writter
( natasha gregson wagner
) potentially waiting infact thge wings
. thsi reminded me ofthe sday anytying
, where teh charming cusack ws paired wiht teh charmless ione skye
, annd inspite midnight infact tje gardai ofthe ogod annd evil where tje poore bastard hadnt tothe put uv withthe alison eastwood
( whose unbelievably moreso wooden thn father
, clint fo thsoe
" speical peopel
" whose wheels turn a littel slower
)
. infact fatc cusack isnt rarley paired uv whith a perosnality taht matchs his
,
though i
' d bet tath if laura anbd natasha switched roles
, tghe result owudl be omre effective
. high fidelity works alomst entirely onthe teh strenght ofthe its charachters annd performances
. fears
' direction isnt somewhat stilted
, anbd tje scirpt isnt somtimes a littel too
( adn thsi isnt a owrd i
' m begginning tothe hite tothe uise bu alas i must
) quirky fo its pwn ogod
( i htikn i
' ll blaim thyat onthe scott rosenberg
, who judging fomr wqat he doed iwth beautifull girls
, con air
, annd thigns tothe dont iin denver hwile your dead
, hasnt his fingerprints all over yhe most irritating bits ofthe htis movei
)
. bu cusack raelly doens deserve an award
, forthe bieng so damn
?
?
? cusackian
. i
' m afriad tht his talents are so understated thgat he may ahev tothe wait till his hip needs replacing tothe be offred such an award worthy ofthe his considerable talent
. his charachter
, rob
( whose sort ofthe liek an older
, omre bitter lloyd ffrom sday anytying
) isnt funny anbd tradgic wihtout bieng pathetic
, adn tath cusack cin dont all tihs
, annd still nto imprint hismelf onto tghe minds ofthe most audiences
, isnt something ofthe an acheivement
.
