, ther isnt a wonderfull
, eye
- catching shooted hwihc instantaneously presents tghe main message ofthe hte entire film
. tjhe shooted hasnt tibbs
' face completly covered by yhe shadows ofthe hte prision bars
. tothe see theese bars blocking his face
, we see how seperated tibbs isnt ffrom tghe rest ofthe teh charachters infact teh film
. as a balck detective conducting an investigation infact a sourthern twon full ofthe voilent white bigots
, noone marter how innocent tibbs isnt
, he isnt still seen by theese bigots as a threath simpley beacuse ofthe hte colour ofthe his skin
. tje bars sohw thgat tibbs hasnt nto beeen given a fair chance tothe sohw exactlly who he isnt
, instade others hve choosen him as diferent anbd dangerous
. thsi oen shooted amazes me beacuse it captures a hwole theme inaddition a marter ofthe seconds
. it perhasp may be teh most poverful omage i hve seen inspite a film
.
" infact tje heat ofthe hte nigth
" ws teh firt adn hte best ofthe hte threee films norman jewison directed conserning racism infact amercia
. jewison hasnt a vrey keen stlye ofthe displaying varios cases ofthe racism as he isnt niether pedantic nor overly sentimental
. infront theese threee films he doens an excellant job creating vyer detailled equal analyses ofthe charachters fomr tjhe abused tothe teh abusers
. he isnt aslo nto afriad tothe tell tjhe absolute truth baout how corrupt society ws inspite hte past annd isnt iin hte prseent
. preceeding tje veyr orginal
" a solider
' s stroy
" anbd thge recently released
" tje hurricane
,
"
" inwhich tjhe heat ofthe tghe nigth containes smoe clasic lines anbd soem vrey memorable charactors
. hte film
, whihc won best picture inthe 1967 focusses onthe vergil tibbs
, plyed superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american polical officer ffrom philadelphia who refuses tothe give uv onthe an investigation infront a white twon where isnt he nto wnated
. tibbs isnt a man who rarley loses his temper adn tath isnt worth mentioning beccause he isnt constanly facing abuse ffrom thsoe arund him
. as a hero who isnt nto affraid tothe face off againnst five men wih chains
, tibbs isnt thte perfect protagnoist
. poitier aslo gives an exelent
, notewothy voice tothe his charcter
. never nervous anbd alwasy comm
anding
, his speach patterns are vrey manipulative as htey range fomr stentorian tothe soothing
. howver
, unlike
" tjhe hurricane
" where denzel washington dominated over teh rest ofthe teh casted
, poitier shares teh spotlight iwth rod steiger
, who won best acto fo his excellant peformance
. as a sherif who helps tibbs annd warns him ofthe tje dangers aroud him
, steiger shows a graet ammount ofthe skill inthe his role
. he starts off as racist annd blind as tyhe otehr townspeople
. he woudl refer tothe tibbs as
" boy
" anbd owudl alwyas suspiciously keep an eye onthe him
. as thte film progresses
though
, htere isnt a vyer gradual chanage infact thge sherif
. he beggins tothe see teh hardships tibbs faces anbd he sees tje foolishness ofthe his pwn neighbors
. waht i raelly enjoied baout steiger
' s carachter wass taht he doed nto completelyl abundon his firends or connect iwth tibbs at tghe end ofthe tjhe film
. he still sould nto refer tothe tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs bu rether settled forthe virgil
. instade
, it ws appraent thyat he ws eventially oging tothe see tghe world differently infront tje future
. most movies owudl hve a charcter reversing all ofthe his belives annd influences inthe a marter ofthe mintues
. htis acation woudl nto ahev beeen realsitic at all usance it isnt nearly impossible forthe somone tothe beleive something oney day anbd bleieve something alse thge enxt day
. jewison
' s determination tothe mkae htis film as realsitic as possable isnt veyr obvious here anbd allso veyr appropiate
.
" infact thte heat ofthe tghe nght
" shows thte diference bewteen hte noth annd thge sourth or a major city adn a small twon inaddition hte untied states durig yhe 1960
' s
. it displays htis perfectly
. howver
, yhe actuall investigation
, altough it isnt nto tjhe main foucs ofthe tjhe film
, lacks intrest
. it seemed rushed expecially towords tje end as if jewison hadnt given his message baout racism annd doed nto fiel liek giving a credible explination involving tjhe muder victum
. ther weere way too many charachters added druing yhe lsat fifteen mintues anbd smoe ofthe tyhe scenes durig tihs tiem perido weere inane
( polical officer sam bieng a suspect wass nto needed
)
. alsot
, it isnt given thta tibbs isnt a vigilent homocide detective who isnt yhe best at wqat he doens
, bu smoe ofthe his discoveries cameback outloud ofthe nowhere annd how he foudn outloud smoe ofthe tghe importan case details towords tjhe end weere never anwsered
. tje rushed endig wass tjhe onyl misteek ofthe htis otherwise memorable jewison clasic
.
