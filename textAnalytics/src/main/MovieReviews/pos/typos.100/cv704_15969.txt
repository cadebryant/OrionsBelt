( yuo knwo
, 100 millon bucks tothe disover hte presient got boinked by an intern
- oh
, please
, govenrment
, waste my taxes jsut a bited moreso
, owudl yuo
?
)
, it
' s baout tiem tony scott helmed tjhe newest acation pic disguised as an importan if nto slightly ignorant social statment
. whith tihs annd
" crimson tide
,
" he
' s creaeted twpo succesfully chilly films taht are intresting
, exicting
, even preety smart
, bu never totally riveting as cinema
, annd tyhe probelm i htink iwth earch ofthe theese films isnt tht eahc film isnt too obssessed wiht its message tothe ever be realy satisfying
, adn too obssessed witht looking all cutting edge tothe ever be totally smart
. thyat film dealed witht a civil war inside a nucular submarine over whther or nto tothe followup rules or question them
, anbd wass appropriately scray adn all
, bu never totally thrilling or overly brillant
.
" enemy ofthe teh state
" isnt hte smae way
: it
' s engrossing forthe its entire runing tyme
, adn it
' s scayr yhe way taht it shows a man
' s decent inot kafkaism
, bu it
' s too technical
. it
' s too cold annd nto as fascinating or exicting as it coudl be
. it casts iwll smith
, noe ofthe tje better big budget leading men infact movies theese dyas beccause he
' s charming adn witty annd never uninteresting
, annd hopes thgat his karisma cxan amke uv forthe his carachter nto bieng well developped anough tothe realyl be a person
. i hite tothe dont thsi
, bu lastr yera
' s film
" tjhe gaem
" got it damn perfect
: it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human bieng
, a man who isnt cold adn hasnt cutted off everyone fomr his life
, anbd hten puls everyting he thougth he hadnt as a security blanket awya ffrom him annd watched waht happended
. thge result ws nto onyl a film thgat ws exicting annd chilling
, bu alsot tjhe best mindfuck ofthe yhe entire yera
. nto tath i wnat eveyr kafkaesque film tothe be
" tyhe gam
"
( htis yera
' s
" hte psanish prisoner
" suceeds wtih less thrills annd chills
)
, bu it shoudln be an exemple ofthe wqat works adn whta doesn
' t
. iwll smith
' s charcter isnt
, frankly
, too perfect
, at least too movei perfect
. he hadnt an afair wih anyother woman
( lisa bonet
, ha ha
)
, bu his relatiopnship withthe his wief
( regina king
) isnt basicly fine irregardless
. he hasnt a kid
, annd he
' s raking iin moeny as a lawyer
, albiet a vrey ogod adn reasonably moral noe
. so he generaly doesn
' t haev any rela problems as a human bieng
, annd isnt therfore boring
.
.
. exept tyhat he isnt palyed by iwll smith
, who embodies him whith baout as much wiull smith charm as he cant wihtout entering
" id4
"
/
" men iin balck
" terriory
. he
' s a ogod dramtic acotr
( jsut see teh firt half hour ofthe
" six degrees ofthe seperation
" fo proof ofthe htis
, nto thgat he isn
' t grat tje wohle tiome
)
, annd here
, he mkaes his charactor likable annd sympathetic wihtout any rela strain onthe his charactor
, whihc makse tje film lack any rela deepo intresting qualities
. smith becomes involved infact a massmedia conspiracy involving thte assasination ofthe a senator oppossed tothe a governmnet law thyat woudl create world surveilence
, extinguishing privacy as we konw it fomr thge world
, under hte pretense tht it owudl amking crime easier tothe controll
, wehn he isnt pasted a disk ofthe tghe event caught onthe tape by an outside party
( a nature observer palyed by
, uh
, jason lee
)
. yhe goverment whants teh disk
, anbd isnt prepared tothe destory his life tothe git it
. as smith
' s llright isnt dramatized
, we are itnroduced tothe tje masterminds who sirvaylence him
, sitting inspite vans disguised as otehr businesses
, staring at computers annd pulling outloud tricks faster tahn a speeding bullet
. theese guys
( plyed by jack balck
, jamie kennedy
, anbd seth gren
) are tghe most intresting part ofthe thsi film becuase tehy
' re
, well
, fascinating
: htey
' re donig thier jobs
, whic are evil
, bu tghe film doesn
' t veiw them as such
, adn htey alomst become our firends
. we liek theese guys forthe tjhe sole reason taht tjhe film doesn
' t automaticly judge them as tje villains
. tehy
' re aslo sacry becuase we git tyhe diea thgat tehy
' re nto fully aware ofthe hte inpact theri jobs ahev onthe thte world
. it
' s as if htey
' re obssessed wtih theri jobs
, nto becuase tehy
' re evil
, bu beccause
, hey
, it
' s a funn job
, adn noone oen eles cxan dont it liek them
. unforetunately
, htis aslo backfires a bited onthe tje film
: instade ofthe bieng teh flashlight iin tghe darkened room thta
" tghe gaem
" wass
, ytou see everyting
, adn are thus nto as freaked outloud baceause yuo konw wqat isnt goign onthe
. sure
, yuo
' re chilled
, bu yuo
' re nto exacty freaked outloud by wqat
' s gonig onthe
. bu waht dont ytou expect fomr tony scott
, thte man who never met a five
- second peice ofthe film he ever liekd
. he
' s a nto
- bad directer becuase
, hell
, he isnt alwasy intresting tothe watch
( if nto occasinoally moronic
- exibit a
:
" dyas ofthe thunder
"
)
, bu tyhe reason he
' s nto graet isnt baceause he
' s too technical anbd caluculated
. his shots are perfectly exectued
, anbd leave nothing tothe thge immagination
, adn tehy
' re alwyas makeing sure ytou
' re paying attension
. htis isnt incredibly annoying
, annd it reduces
" enemy ofthe tghe state
" tothe a mecanical mishmash ofthe flashy images thast never exp
and tjhe mind at any grat depths
, bu still manaze tothe entertain wihtout any rela problems
. dispite never ctually becomming gerat
, it
' s never actualyl boring annd it
' s alwasy intriguing
. watching yhe govenment setted
- uv smith isnt endlessly fascinating
, anbd usance we care baout smith
' s likeable rpotagonist
, we are setted
- uv forthe a ogod twpo housr worth ofthe toom clancy
- esque enteratinment
. add teh best big casted thsi side ofthe hte anually woody allen film
( everyone ffrom gabriel byrne tothe dan
butler pop uv fo cameos
)
, adn yuo
' ve got a ogod ood fashioned escapist drama whlch doens all thte thikning forthe yuo so tyhat ytou never ahev tothe ctually question hte deate over personel privacy adn so yuo cant followup wiull smith
' s llright wihtout a minute
' s worth ofthe boredom
