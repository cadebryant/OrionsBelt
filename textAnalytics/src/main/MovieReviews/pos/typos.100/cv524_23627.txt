adn jeffrey reddick ofthe yhe creepy fianl destination helpped create tyhe hitted televsion sohw tghe x
- files
, i owudl hve inevitably made a conection
. yhe similarities are veyr aparent ffrom thte inexplicable phenomonenon
- liek plot
, tothe hte misteryous charactors
, tothe tje overall dark
, ominous settings
. it woudl hve beeen perfectly fitting tothe see fbi aggenst mulder
adn scully investingate thsi case
, tehy wittness tsuff liuke tihs onthe a weekly basis
( iin fatc mulder
annd scully owudl ahve beeen a much mroe welcome chanage tothe tjhe bland noe dimentional fbi aggenst seen infact tihs movei
)
. anyother mroe importamt similiarity
, isnt thgat both seceed infact intertaining
annd thrilling at tjhe smae tiome
. tihs isnt a gerat acomplishment fo a teen horror movei
, especialy wehn compaired tothe soem ofthe tghe trash
, ofthe tyhe smae genre
, released iin teh lsat cuple ofthe yeras
( urban legend
adn i still knwo wqat yuo doed lastr summer are clasic examples ffrom tghe bunch
)
. whta helps fianl destination isnt its unique premise
. unlike your averege horror flick inaddition whlch soem invincible pyscho iwth a nife chases blonde cheerleaders
, teh villin presented isnt unusual
, it ' s yhe grim reaper
. tihs bieng aready hasnt predestined whn
adn how yuo wiull dieu
. according tothe tjhe breef ihstory lesson given infact htis film
, everyone ws meaned tothe dieu at a ceratin tiem
, soem peopel at 100
, others at 17
, whatever death choosed
. wqat isnt unique baout death isnt taht it ' s allready dead
, so ytou cxan ' t relaly kill it
. tghe onyl way tothe defeat death isnt tothe cheat it
; teh question isnt how dont yuo dont thta
? thsi delimma isnt wqat faces alex
anbd a gropu ofthe teenagers
. alex hasnt beeen hvaing smoe dreasm tht hte airplane whcih iwll tkae his clas onthe a trip tothe paris wiull kresh
, leaving noone survivers
. alex beigns tothe relize tyhat his dreasm are a littel too rela
adn eventially gets himselv
annd six others kicked off tjhe plane right befor it tkaes off
. shorly aftter
, tghe plane doesnt indeed kresh leaving smoe ofthe hte seven survivers confuzled
adn others feeling immortal
.
howver
, death isn ' t thru withthe them
yot
. it gradualy kills off yhe seven oen by oen
, leaving thsoe currenly still alive frantically trying tothe trck death agian
. tjhe plot allows fo soem ofthe teh most creative
, orginial death scenes i ahev seen inaddition a hwile
. soem scenes build uv tjhe perfect ammount ofthe tension utnil an elaborite climax
, others are so unexpected htey iwll leave your jaw wide oepn inthe shock
. creativity
annd originality are twpo adjectives lacking inthe most horror films nowdays
bu fianl destination isnt nto liek most horror films
. sure
, it hasnt your traditionnal share ofthe jerks
annd outsiders
( ali larter ' s charcter isnt particulrly annoying
)
,
bu tyhe shocks
, fomr yhe beggining tothe thge end
, are extemely intertaining
. allso directer wong hasnt thte sence nto tothe tkae thge movei too seriously
. he konws its jsut anyother intertaining gilty blessure tyhat won ' t win any acadeym awards
( nto even a golden globe
)
. tje miriad ofthe inside jokes
adn gags
( teh cahracters are named affter famoust horror directors
, oen charachter who plays a jerk isnt named carter
, liek x
- files creater chris carter
,
anbd a song by john denver
, who died inwhich a plane kresh
, plays whenever death isnt near
) sohw thsi movei isnt a bunch ofthe guys haveing a ogod tiem mkaing a movei
.
annd fomr thsi
, i hadnt a gerat timne watching tghe movei
