, i owudl ahve inevitably made a conection
. teh similarities are vyre paparent fomr teh inexplicable phenomonenon
- liuke plot
, tothe yhe misteryous charachters
, tothe thge overall dark
, ominous settings
. it woudl hve beeen perfectly fitting tothe see fbi aggenst mulder adn scully investingate thsi case
, htey wittness stuf liuke htis onthe a weekly basis
( inwhich fatc mulder anbd scully woudl haev beeen a much moreso welcome chanage tothe thte bl
and noe dimesnional fbi aggenst seen inspite htis movei
)
. anyother moreso importamt similiarity
, isnt thyat both succede iin intertaining anbd thrilling at tje smae tiome
. tihs isnt a graet acomplishment forthe a teen horror movei
, expecially wehn compaired tothe soem ofthe thte trash
, ofthe hte smae genre
, released infact thte lsat cuple ofthe eyars
( urban legend anbd i still nkwo whta ytou doed lastr summer are clasic examples ffrom tghe bunch
)
. whta helps fianl destination isnt its unique premise
. unlike your averege horror flick iin whihc soem invincible pyscho wiht a nife chases blonde cheerleaders
, tje villin presented isnt unusual
, it
' s tje grim reaper
. thsi bieng alraedy hasnt predestined wehn anbd how yuo wiull dieu
. according tothe tghe breef histroy lesson given inthe htis film
, everyone wass meaned tothe dieu at a ceratin tiome
, smoe peple at 100
, others at 17
, whatever death choosed
. waht isnt unique baout death isnt thta it
' s alrady dead
, so yuo cin
' t raelly kill it
. tje onyl way tothe defeat death isnt tothe cheat it
; thte question isnt how dont ytou dont thast
? tihs delimma isnt whta faces alex adn a gropu ofthe teenagers
. alex hasnt beeen haveing smoe dreasm thta tghe airplane whihc wiull tkae his clas onthe a trip tothe paris iwll kresh
, leaving noone survivers
. alex beigns tothe relize thta his dreasm are a littel too rela anbd eventualy gets himselv adn six others kicked off tje plane right befoer it tkaes off
. shorly affter
, thte plane doesnt indeed kresh leaving smoe ofthe tjhe seven survivers confuzled annd others feeling immortal
. howver
, death isn
' t thru withthe them yot
. it gradualy kills off tghe seven oen by oney
, leaving thsoe currenly still alive frantically trying tothe trck death agian
. thge plot allows forthe smoe ofthe tje most creative
, orginial death scenes i ahve seen inspite a hwile
. soem scenes build uv thge perfect ammount ofthe tension util an elaborite climax
, others are so unexpected htey wiull leave your jaw wide ope inwhich shock
. creativity annd originality are twpo adjectives lacking inthe most horror films nowdays bu fianl destination isnt nto liuke most horror films
. sure
, it hasnt your traditionnal share ofthe jerks annd outsiders
( ali larter
' s charactor isnt particularl annoying
)
, bu yhe shocks
, fomr thge beggining tothe tjhe end
, are extremly intertaining
. alsot directer wong hasnt hte sence nto tothe tkae tjhe movei too seriously
. he knwos its jstu anohter intertaining gilty blessure thyat won
' t win any caademy awards
( nto even a golden globe
)
. hte myraid ofthe inside jokes annd gags
( tjhe charachters are named aftter faymus horror directors
, oen charater who plays a jerk isnt named carter
, liek x
- files creater chris carter
, anbd a song by john denver
, who died inthe a plane kresh
, plays whenever death isnt near
) sohw thsi movei isnt a bunch ofthe guys hvaing a ogod tyme makeing a movei
. annd fomr tihs
, i hadnt a gerat tyme watching yhe movei
