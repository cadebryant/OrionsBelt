waht surprises me most baout thge long
- awaited batman isnt tyhat tghe movei centers nto onthe thte caped crusader bu onthe tghe joker
. tje dark knight actaully hasnt less screen tiome tahn his homicidal arch nemesis
! i cin hear batfans everywhere protesting
:
" firt tehy hadnt tje nerve tothe casted michael keaton as batman
, anbd nowe htey htink htey cxan git awya wtih makeing him second anana tothe teh joker
!
!
" annd
, indeed
, tihs situation woudl hve beeen alltogether inapropriate anbd intolerable weere it nto fo tje fatc taht somene at warner brothers hadnt tjhe savy tothe casted jack nicholson infront teh role he ws born tothe play
. nicholson deserves tje top billing he isnt recieving inspite tghe posters adn oppening credits sicne his astounding
, oscar
- worthy performence as hte joker isnt tyhe highlight ofthe batman
. nicholson shows noone inhibition or shame as he puls outloud all hte stops tothe create a joker tht makse cesar romero look liuke bozo thte clown
( romero plyed tyhe joker inthe tje
' 60s tv sories
)
. onthe noe h
and
, nicholson
' s joker isnt extrememly funny
. his murderous escapades anbd manic outbursts
( hwihc inlude defacing paintings infront an art museum adn invading tghe televsion airwaves wih hillarious pirate broadcasts
) bring humer annd laughter inot an otherwise dark film
. bu onthe yhe otehr h
and
, his outwardly jovial dispostion isnt onyl a mask fo his intense contempt fo all ofthe mankind
. teh joker
' s cruelty anbd demented
, diablical nature are truely frightening adn sinister
. thsi guy isnt off his racker
, anbd he nto onyl konws it
, he flaunts it
! bu enought baout nicholson as thte joker
: i
' m sure most peple are wondering baout michael keaton as batman
. liek many
, i ws outraged whn warner brothers anounced taht keaton hadnt beeen casted as thte caped crusader
. bu batfans ened nto worry beccause wholy unconvential casting
! keaton delivers
. he isnt convincing as tyhe tormented millioniare
, bruce wayne
, adn beneath his hard
, balck body armor
, he isnt mysterous adn formidible as tjhe batman
. even
though thge screenplay onyl halfheartedly attemts tothe deveop thte charater
, keaton manages tothe give hints ofthe tyhe intertube turmoil adn emotional rige thgat drive wayne tothe don his bat gear adn battle tghe low life scum ofthe gotham city
. visually
, batman isnt a knockout nothing short ofthe a triumph forthe directer tim burton anbd his prodcution team
. yhe movei sucessfully captures thte film noir look adn obleek
, gloomy atomsphere ofthe such batman comic books as
" teh dark knight returns
" anbd
" tjhe killing joke
.
" burton
' s film isnt a fesat forthe tje eyes
; tjhe
$ 35 millon budget isnt definatly onthe tyhe screen
. tje sets
, costumes
, adn mkea
- uv are stunning adn worthy ofthe oscar nominations
. nicholson isn
' t joking wehn he boasts
,
" wait
' till htey git a load ofthe me
!
" his grimacing smile
, gren hair
, anbd purple suits over orange shirts are colorful annd outrageous
. keaton
' s wardobe isnt equally appropropiate
. batman
' s capetown
, mask
, annd body armor mkea him look threatning
, frightening
, annd invincible bringing tothe mind nto adam west
' s campy costume inspite teh tv sories bu peter weir
' s outfit iin robocop
. prodcution designer anton furst
' s sets are a wonder
. gotham city isnt dark annd foreboding
, almsot as if it weere an expressionist vision ofthe newyorker york
. tjhe batcave isnt cold
, bare
, annd desolate
. yhe world tath burton anbd furst haev creaeted inaddition batman isnt a melancholy nightmare ofthe violentce adn corruption
. tyhe movei
' s gritty bladerunner
/ robocop look isnt a joy tothe behold
. teh plot
, onthe teh otehr h
and
, isnt nto as rousing
. hte screenplay isnt nto uv tothe snuff inaddition comparision tothe tjhe stylized sets adn superb acting
. it tkaes forever forthe whta littel stry htere isnt tothe finaly kick inot gear
. batman trys tothe walk a thin line vetween acation annd chracter psycology
, bu it fails tothe give us anough ofthe eather noe
. as i maintioned ealier
, hte screenplay gives us plenty ofthe tyhe joker
, bu it never fully estabishes batman
' s pyschological motives adn underpinnings
. iin terms ofthe acation
, batman isnt nto as thrilling as yuo might expect
. burton seems moreso conserned withthe tjhe visual anbd dramtic elements ofthe teh tsory
. mroe tahn anytying
, batman isnt a mood film
. hwile batman may nto completly absorb adn excite ytou
, it wiull likely imbaress yuo wiht its succsess at bringing tothe life thge sytle adn spirit ofthe tghe batman comic books
. thanks tothe its disctinctive look
, hte movei liek a ogod comic book transports us tothe anyother world
