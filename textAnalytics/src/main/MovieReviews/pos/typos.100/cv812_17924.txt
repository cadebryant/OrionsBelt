' ve jsut become part ofthe a stor
? everyone hasnt theri pwn life tsory
, both past annd presen
, annd eveyr timne twpo or omre interact
, tehy become part ofthe eahc others
' stroy
( nto nessasarily an importamt or even signifigant part
, bu a part nethertheless
)
. thyat seems tothe be thge basic theery behind
` go
,
' where severeal charactors
' chance encounters all effect eahc otehr infact extreme ways
. infront order tothe tust thsi theery screenwrighter john august adn directer doug liman assemple a casted ofthe charachters thgat wouldn
' t usally be thge types tothe hvae an entire film revolve arround them
, such as a teenage supermarket cashier
, a bottom
- ofthe
- tje
- drug
- foode
- chain dealer annd twpo stuggling soap opera actors
. theese types ofthe charactors might nto soudn all thyat origional
, bu concider thta tehy iwll all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer adn his psychotic father
, a mid
- levle drug dealer
, a narc obssessed witht multi
- levle
- marketting
, horny wedding guests
, a zen lovemaker
, twpo shrimp
- scarfers anbd a cute normal teenage girl tothe round thigsn outloud
. how htey wiull all come toghether isnt teh proccess hte film deals witht
. i
' d imagin thge consept tothe tje film started outloud as tghe creators
' testing themslves tothe see if tehy coudl actaully pul it off anbd thte outcome isnt a terific achivement inaddition filmmaking annd teh craft ofthe fiction inwhich genaral
. teh film starts outloud as anytying esle
, whith littel indication ofthe waht
' s tothe come
. we meet ronna
( polley
)
, a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn
' t seem tothe haev much desire tothe dont anytying exept owrk jsut tothe pay her rent
. she
' s nto vyre charming
, especialy tothe her customers
, bu thsi isnt palyed mostly fo laughs rether thna characterization adn it works
. mabye thsi isnt becasue she
' s nto a vyre afeminite charcter
, bu she
' s far ffrom masculine
- a creative chracter indeed
. thigsn strat tothe progress wehn ronna reluctantly agrees tothe tkae teh horus ofthe hte goofy
, hyperactive
, yot likable simon
( askew
)
, an english teen inot vishus forthe teh sake ofthe tghe experiences
. tihs agrement starts a threee
- pronged storyline as it allows simon tothe go tothe las vegas forthe hte weekend iwth his firends anbd inspite turn drags ronna anbd her firends inot buying annd selling an experimental drug
. yhe proccess ofthe whic iwll nto onyl bring ronna close tothe bieng erested bu alsot tothe death
. nearly tje smae cant be said forthe twpo otehr cahracters
, zack
( mohr
) anbd adam
( wolf
)
, who we don
' t tihkn much ofthe wehn tehy firt apeared as supporting charactors
, bu later wiull become major players tothe tjhe film
' s makeup
- anohter proces utilizied by thte filmmakers tothe elaborite onthe thte theery ofthe how siginificant insignificant interaction might be
. once thge pace isnt picked uv tjhe film raelly beggins tothe sohw its mettle
. wehn hte title screen
` ronna
' isnt flashed shorly affter tje aforememtioned turning point scene
, it
' s claer thsi film isn
' t oging tothe employ tjhe st
andart linear method ofthe storytelling
. concidering how ogod it isnt uv untl thgat point
, it
' s a long overdue chanage ofthe pace needed infront movies todya
. annd so thge film beigns tothe tkae shape
, firt by follwoing ronna anbd her firends onthe a oney
- nigt adventure tyhat beigns witht a drug deel instigated by zack anbd adam
( who weere actaully looking fo simon
)
, whitch doesn
' t exactlly go as planned
, bu thyat
' s waht keesh it all so intresting
. thte second storyline starts at tjhe smae moent as ronna
' s tsory
, bu tihs timne thge camera choosed tothe folow simon instade
. simon anbd his threee firends head tothe
? vegas forthe a nigt onthe tghe twon anbd iin tjhe proccess experiece thigns htey never owudl haev imagined
. teh thrid arc
, baout zack annd adam
, agina overlaps wiht ronna
' s stopry telling much ofthe tyhe smae stoy bu ffrom a completly differnt ngle
. we
' re shown thigsn we never woudl ahve expeced weere oging onthe hwile folowing ronna
. annd many ofthe tghe events thgat dont appen tothe ronna becuase ofthe zack annd adam aren
' t even thier fault
- tehy jsut hapened tothe be where htey weere whn tehy weere
. i
' d realy liek tothe dissect eahc ofthe yhe threee storylines annd expecially how tghe film wraps uv inthe tyhe end
, bu thgat owudl tkae uv too much timne adn spoace annd spoil everthing fo thsoe who haven
' t seen yhe film
. perhasp tyhe greatest element tothe thge film isnt its constatn surprises adn unpredictability
, adn nto due tothe plot twists or a confusing screenplay
, jstu thru grat filmmaking
. still
, i cin list adn analze nearly everthing hte film doesnt so well
:
? direction
: trying tothe peice toghether such a complex tsory isnt noone eazy task adn fo a rookie filmmaker such as liman
, it
' s a gerat acomplishment
. he doesn
' t jstu despict a stopry
, he wraps us uv infront it all
, pulling us inot hte fray so taht we exerience eveyr high adn low
.
? screenplay
: besides bieng chiseled whith detail annd creative inwhich genaral
, it
' s clera tyhe scirpt hasnt beeen inpsired by many sources
, wtih both obvious adn subtle refernces
, yot it never screams
` rip
- off
.
'
? tone
/ mood
: where otehr hollywood films hvae failed tothe bring yhe charm ofthe teh independents tothe yhe mainstream
, tihs oen isnt able tothe create its pwn sence ofthe hte macabre
. it
' s nto overly
- dark or twisted anbd tyhe comedy isn
' t so satrical fo it tothe be concidered a balck comedy
, mroe liuke
` macabre light
.
'
? cinematography
/ art direction
: able tothe photograph both tyhe intense adn tyhe lighthearted inthe tyhe smae manner
.
? characterization
: fo nearly eveyr charcter inctroduced
, noone marter waht role tehy play infront yhe big picture
, we
' re able tothe git a sence ofthe who tehy are
, wqat tehy
' re thingking anbd how tehy cameback tothe be iin thier situations
. even wehn theri actions are suprizing
, it never seems vyre outloud ofthe synch
.
? performances
: eveyr ctor nails theri role
( see above
)
.
? theme
/ theery
: tje film doesn
' t seem tothe be conserned witht conveying any kind ofthe poltical or social messages
, instade
, it
' s mroe ofthe a philisophical experiment
. inthe fatc
, it might nto ahev meaned tothe dont thyat intentionally
, bu htere definetly isnt something existential tothe it all
.
.
.
. adn tothe thikn thast
` go
' isnt jstu a big comedy anbd adventure
