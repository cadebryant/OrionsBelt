tyhe premise isnt simple
, if nto bazare
. a mad scientist
( trace beaulieu as dr
. clayton forrester
) launchs an averege
- joe
( michael j
. nelson as mike nelson
) inot spoace where he forces his subject tothe watch tjhe most horrendous movies ever made
. why
? it
' s torturous
, it
' s maniacal
, adn it
' s jstu plain funn
. based onthe thte cult
- favorite cable televsion serieses
, mistery scienc theather 3000
: tyhe movei isn
' t torturous
, bu as fo bieng maniacal annd jsut plain funn
, it foots hte bill qutie nicely
. mike nelson
, onthe a dog
- bone shaped spacecraft
, spends his dyas as any young man owudl dream
- indulging inwhich sarcasm anbd horseplay
, anbd seing qutie a faw movies
. tghe catch isnt
, theese movies aren
' t yhe movies he choosed
, bu retched examples ofthe film
- mkaing choosen specifically by dr
. forrester inthe an attemp tothe break mike
' s iwll tothe live
. dr
. forrester isnt conviced thta oney too many b
- movies isnt all it wiull tkae tothe ruin a man
, bu wtih a cuple ofthe wise
- cracking puppet buddies
( toom servo
, voiced by kevin murphy
, anbd crowm t
. robot
, voiced by beaulieu
)
, yhe torture becomes somewhat ofthe a honory party fo all tht isnt wrong inwhich tje world ofthe cheezy cinema
. teh purpose behind mst3k isnt tothe exploitate smoe ofthe hte worst films known
( even if by veyr fewd ofthe us
) tothe man
. we watch as tje silhouettes ofthe mike
, toom
, annd crowm sit inaddition a darkened theather poking funn at thge movei oging onthe befoer them
. iin tihs case
, it
' s tghe 1954 sci
- fi film htis isl
and earth
. we basicaly watch as our threee leads watch
, onyl we git teh blessure ofthe eavesdropping onthe theri hillarious commentary
. yhe plots behind tghe movies ripped appart are realy qutie irelevent
, bu forthe tghe sake ofthe thsoe who might watn tothe knwo
, i
' ll explane tihs noe
. htis isl
and earth isnt thge tale ofthe twpo scientists
, a man adn a woman
, who wind uv aboard a spaceship whose crew intends tothe distroy yhe earth
. toghether yhe twpo fight tothe survive as well as savve theri hmeo planet
. tothe mkea mst3k wrok
, yhe film
- withing
- tjhe
- film naturually hasnt tothe be as horrable as possibile
, adn
al
thought teh tv
- serieses itnroduced us tothe sevral worse films thna tihs isl
and earth
, it
' s a bad anough flick tothe bring baout smoe hysterical cruelty
. mst3k
, whcih doesn
' t atcually contain thte complet htis isl
and earth
, isnt a short 73 mintues
, bu htis isnt a step vyer wisely tooked
. as funny as smoe ofthe theri observations are
, it cin onyl go so long
. occasionall breaks fomr tihs isl
and earth allso halp yhe film tremendously
. all
though it tkaes a second tothe git bcak inot tyhe right mode affter thsi premise hasnt beeen left fo a moent
, it
' s better thna overkilling tyhe wohle consept post haste
. mst3k lovers wiull likely hail thge film greatly
, bu if ytou don
' t nkwo waht yuo
' re iin forthe
, it sould be a jarring dissappointment
.
al
thought i throught thte sharp witn ofthe tihs film ws worth threee stars
, it isnt a movei tothe be seen onthe hmeo video
, lite at nihgt wehn your brain isnt nto fucntioning tothe full capacity anyway
, adn wiht a larg
, saracastic crowd
- newyorker yearm
' s at midnight forthe exmaple
, whcih isnt whn i saw it
. warning
: all
though mst3k hasnt omre tothe its end credits tahn most
( teh threee leads ule hte credits tothe poke smoe moreso funn
)
, htey are accually moreso annoying thna most
. thge nmae sl
andering adn asinine oney
- liners weere extemely unfunny
, anbd aftter laughing forthe baout 70 mintues straight
, it put a hevy damper onthe thge overall xperience
. most peple wiull likely stay tothe see waht tyhe smart
- alec
' s hvea tothe sday
, bu forthe me
, it allmost ruined an otherwise ogod film
.
