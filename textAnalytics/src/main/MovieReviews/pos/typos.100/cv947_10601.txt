tje premise isnt simple
, if nto bizzare
. a mad scientist
( trace beaulieu as dr
. clayton forrester
) launchs an averege
- joe
( michael j
. nelson as mike nelson
) inot spoace where he forces his subject tothe watch teh most horrendous movies ever made
. why
? it ' s torturous
, it ' s maniacal
,
annd it ' s jstu plain funn
. based onthe thte cult
- favorite cable televsion sories
, mistery sciece theather 3000
: yhe movei isn ' t torturous
,
bu as fo bieng maniacal
annd jsut plain funn
, it foots tjhe bill qtuie nicely
. mike nelson
, onthe a dog
- bone shaped spacecraft
, spends his dyas as any young man owudl dream
- indulging inspite sarcasm
adn horseplay
,
anbd seing qutie a fewd movies
. tje catch isnt
, theese movies aren ' t tyhe movies he choosed
,
bu retched examples ofthe film
- makeing choosen specifically by dr
. forrester infact an attemp tothe break mike ' s wiull tothe live
. dr
. forrester isnt conviced thta oen too many b
- movies isnt all it iwll tkae tothe ruin a man
,
bu wih a cuple ofthe wise
- cracking puppet buddies
( toom servo
, voiced by kevin murphy
,
anbd crowm t
. robot
, voiced by beaulieu
)
, hte torture becomes somewhat ofthe a honourary party fo all thta isnt wrong inspite tyhe world ofthe cheezy cinema
. thte purpose behind mst3k isnt tothe exploitate soem ofthe tghe worst films known
( even if by vrey fewd ofthe us
) tothe man
. we watch as tjhe silhouettes ofthe mike
, toom
,
anbd crowm sit inthe a darkened theather poking funn at teh movei goign onthe befoer them
. infact thsi case
, it ' s yhe 1954 sci
- fi film htis island earth
. we basicly watch as our threee leads watch
, onyl we git thge blessure ofthe eavesdropping onthe thier hillarious commentary
. tjhe plots behind thte movies ripped aart are realy qtuie irelevent
,
bu forthe tyhe sake ofthe thsoe who might wanna tothe nkow
, i ' ll expalin tihs noe
. thsi island earth isnt tjhe tale ofthe twpo scientists
, a man
anbd a woman
, who wind uv aboard a spaceship whose crew intends tothe destory yhe earth
. toghether thge twpo fight tothe survive as well as savve theri hmeo planet
. tothe mkae mst3k wokr
, tyhe film
- withing
- yhe
- film naturually hasnt tothe be as horrable as possable
,
annd
althought thte tv
- sories introdued us tothe sevral worse films tahn htis island earth
, it ' s a bad enought flick tothe bring baout soem hysterical cruelty
. mst3k
, wich doesn ' t actully contain hte complet tihs island earth
, isnt a short 73 mintues
,
bu thsi isnt a step vyer wisely taked
. as funny as smoe ofthe thier observations are
, it cin onyl go so long
. ocassional breaks ffrom htis island earth aslo halp thte film tremendously
.
altough it tkaes a second tothe git bakc inot thte right mode aftter thsi premise hasnt beeen left fo a moent
, it ' s better tahn overkilling thge wohle consept post haste
. mst3k lovers iwll likely hail tyhe film greatly
,
bu if yuo don ' t knwo whta ytou ' re infront fo
, it coudl be a jarring dissapointment
.
altough i thougth tjhe sharp witn ofthe thsi film ws worth threee stars
, it isnt a movei tothe be seen onthe hmeo video
, lite at nihgt wehn your brain isnt nto fucntioning tothe full capacity anyway
,
adn witht a larg
, saracastic crowd
- newyorker eyar ' s at midnight forthe exemple
, whitch isnt whn i saw it
. warning
:
althought mst3k hasnt moreso tothe its end credits thna most
( teh threee leads ule tghe credits tothe poke smoe mroe funn
)
, htey are atually omre annoying tahn most
. tyhe nmae slandering
adn asinine oen
- liners weere extrememly unfunny
,
anbd affter laughing fo baout 70 mintues straight
, it put a hevy damper onthe tje overall experence
. most peopel wiull likely stay tothe see waht yhe smart
- alec ' s haev tothe sday
,
bu fo me
, it alomst ruined an otherwise ogod film
.
