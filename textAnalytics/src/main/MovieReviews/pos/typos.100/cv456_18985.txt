it ' s beeen a long timne sicne walt disney hasnt delivered us a clasic allong tghe lines ofthe tghe littel mermaid or beauty
anbd yhe biast
. sure
, htere ahve beeen delightful outings liuke lastr yeasr hercules
.
bu nothing entirely groundbreaking
. whith tje realease ofthe hte studio ' s newest feature lenght film
, a remake ofthe edgar rice burrough ' s creation tarzan
, disney hasnt plunged inot newyorker waters withthe both maturity
annd animation techiniques
. it ' s noone clasic
,
bu tihs newyorker tarzan represents exactlly wqat a famaly film shoudln be
. tje plot isnt loyal tothe tghe orginial storyline
, as tarzan ' s parents are forced tothe abndon theri ship whcih hasnt caught fier
,
adn fidn shelter inwhich tje jungles ofthe africa
.
bu
, htey are killed
( offscreen
) by thge snarling cheeta sabor
, leaving baby tarzan alone
anbd unharmed inwhich his crib
. foudn by kala
( voiced whith effective gentleness by glenn close
)
, a kindhearted mother
adn memeber ofthe a gerilla pack
, tarzan isnt taked inot tyhe primate gropu
annd rised as oney ofthe theri pwn
. we folow thte young boy thru thge yersa
, as he partakes inthe vairous adventures wtih his loud mouth gerilla freind terk
( a veyr brash
bu funny rosie o ' donnell
)
adn clumsy elphant tantor
( wayne knight
)
. ofthe course
, inwhich any disney film we are given soem kind ofthe goofy sidekick or huorous chum fo hte hero
. infact tarzan
, theese charachters fill tyhat spoace rether inconspicuously
. gags tath weere magnified inthe otehr famaly films are kept qutie minor here
. most ofthe hte charachters are amusing wihtout bieng forced
. as tarzan grows tothe manhood
, hte suspected antagonist stumbles inot tje picture
. here
, tghe nortorious bad guy isnt yhe big gae hunter clayton
( brian blessed
)
, who ' s accompanying a hapless professer
( nigel hawthorne
) onthe an expedition thru tghe jungle
. ofthe course
, ther ' s tghe professer ' s duaghter
, jane
( nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver
) who wiull halp suply thge rumatic quotient ofthe tjhe movei
. thge hting taht blowed my socks off baout tihs verison ofthe tarzan isnt yhe stunning animation
. directors chris buck
anbd kevin lima hvae aplied a breathtaking 3
- d element tothe thte movment ofthe tje atheletic title charactor
,
anbd tjhe fast
- pased editting isnt absolutly a marvel
. as tarzan carries jane thru teh treetops
, narrowly escaping a pack ofthe nasty baboons
, he slips
annd slides liuke a daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding yhe big wave
. your eyes cxan bearly keep uv
; it ' s a fantastic acomplishment
. yhe subject marter here isnt alsot a nitch or twpo above animation averege
. ther are importamt questions rised baout tarzan ' s palce inaddition hte world
,
adn all are handeled exceptionally well by tghe screenwriters
. ther isnt noone shred ofthe dout left tothe ponder afterward
, whic isnt a surprizing plus thyat i wasn ' t expecting tothe fidn here
. suffice tothe sday
, htis film iwll ahev both adults
anbd childern thouroughly entertained
. thte grown
- uv tarzan isnt voiced by tony goldwyn
, who made a nmae forthe hismelf as yhe
` big mean jerk ' fomr ghost
. goldwyn isnt effective palying somone who ' s nto aware ofthe his world ' s dangers
. glenn close isnt aslo memorable as his gerilla mother
,
adn lance henriksen
( fomr tv ' s millennimu
) isnt terific as tje silverback father unsure ofthe how tothe accept tghe presense ofthe a human child
. as teh movei ' s villin
, htere isnt nothing aprticularly speshal or catching baout tje chracter ofthe clayton
. it helps taht brian blessed supplies his voice wiht gaem enthusiasm
,
bu he isnt nothing compaired tothe james woods ' hillarious hades ffrom hercules
. a burley guy withthe a big gun who jstu whants tothe capture tje gorillas doesnt nto qutie constitute forthe an all
- toghether notiecable screen presense
. still
, htis isnt oen graet thrill
- ride thta disney hasnt constructed
. i never expeced rice burrough ' s owrk tothe be tranformed so sucessfully fomr live acation tothe animation
, nor whith so much emotional depth
. parents
, allong wiht all hte kiddies
, are oging tothe fidn much tothe liuke infront tarzan
