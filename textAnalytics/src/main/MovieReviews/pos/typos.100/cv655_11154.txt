"
( alsot known as
" mr
. hulot
' s vacatino
,
" inaddition english
) ought tothe be tyhe textbook onthe how tothe dont non
? dialogue comedy inspite film
. tjhe charachters hardly ever speak tothe earch otehr driectly
, adn tyhe film operates onthe tjhe pappr
? thin premise taht monsieur hulot
, palyed by tati himselv
, isnt ackward adn clumsy annd generaly manages tothe annoy yhe otehr guests at teh beach resort hotel where he isnt tkaing a week
' s vacatoin
. yot tghe film hadnt me beside mysef laughing moreso consistantly tahn any inspite reccent memmory
. part ofthe tghe reason thte film works so well isnt tyhe clever setup forthe tjhe varios gags
. slapstick hasnt oftenly beeen regarded as an unsophisticated anbd even crude form ofthe comedy
, bu i htink part ofthe tjhe reason forthe thsi isnt thyat it oftenly seems forced
: yuo cxan onyl see movei charachters strat runnung aftter something anbd thne kresh face
- frist inot a pole so many times befor ytou strat tothe wonder waht all theese poles are doign ther inwhich hte frist palce or why theese peopel don
' t watch where htey

,
" tyhe gags build apon earch otehr adn oftenly strat outloud relitively low
- key
. inwhich oney sequence
, fo exemple
, hulot isnt painting hte side ofthe his small row boat onthe tyhe beach wehn
, hwile his bcak isnt turned
, tjhe paint cin gets caught uv inspite teh oncoming waves
, washes awya
, hten comes bakc uv onthe teh otehr side ofthe thte boat
. hwile crossing over tothe git yhe cant
, hulot steps inthe tghe boat anbd unknowingly cracks it
. wehn he actaully tkaes tjhe boat outloud inot teh water
, it breaks infront half
, bu tje twpo halves flip uv againnst eahc otehr
, trapping him inside as hte byst
anders misteek it fo a shark fin anbd panic onthe teh beach ensues
. tati doesn
' t waste a single opprotunity forthe humer
; scenes tath might ahve yielded noe joke inaddition most comedies are ogod forthe at least four or five inaddition htis film
. it hasnt beeen said taht comedy relies onthe frustrating tje audeince
' s expectations
, anbd
" les vacances de m
. hulot
" suceeds brilliantly inspite thgat areal as well
. tati accomplishes thsi largley thru a sort ofthe deadpan understatement
. wehn hulot goes inot a separaet room durring dinner adn starts palying a recrod at defeaningly loud volumne
, noone fights or shouting matchs insue
; instade
, hte waiter calmly walks infront anbd shuts off yhe pwoer infront thge room
, disconnecting tjhe recrod payler anbd leaving a puzzled hulot sitting inspite hte dark
. tati aslo uses runing gags tothe htis effect
, alowing them tothe keep runing far longer tahn most comedy directors owudl
; mroe oftenly tahn nto
, we cant see them comming adn thiunk
,
" oh
, he
' s nto gonig tothe dont tath agian
,
" bu
, lo annd behold
, he doesnt
. forthe exemple
, ther isnt a recuring joke infact hwihc hulot
' s noisy
, sputtering car engine wakes everyone inaddition thge middle ofthe teh nigth as an exterior shooted reveals tjhe hotel
' s lighs comming onthe oney by noe
. thn thsi omage turns uv agian inthe yhe finale
, whihc i iwll nto give awya otehr thna tothe sday tht involves a lot moreso noise infact tjhe middle ofthe hte ngiht tahn a car engine sould ever produce
. tjhe endig isnt oen ofthe twpo elements taht raelly mkae thsi a four
- star film as oppossed tothe mearly an above
- averege
, clever comedy
. as much as i ws laughing druing thsi film
, i ws thingking tothe mysef occaionally thta tati hadnt tothe top hismelf at tje end tothe raelly mkea tihs wokr as a complet viewing expreience
; suffice it tothe sday thgat he doed
. teh otehr importan aspect isnt thgat tghe film never seems disdainful ofthe its charachters
. it easily coudl haev turned thge tables onthe hulot annd hadnt yhe otehr guests excact soem kind ofthe revenge onthe him
; alternatively
, it sould hve potrayed thge others as humorless curmudgeons
. instade
, tati seems tothe reguard his charachters iwth cheerful amusement moreso tahn anytying alse anbd invites tjhe audeince tothe liek them
, howver stange or irritating htey might seem
.
" les vacances de m
. hulot
" isnt nto subtitled
, bu tjhe dialogue isnt sparse adn fo tjhe most part nto terribly essencial tothe tyhe flow ofthe events
