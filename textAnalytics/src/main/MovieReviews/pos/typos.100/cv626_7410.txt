thsi resivwar isnt ignorant ofthe wqat hands weere reponsible fo delivering tje origonal verison ofthe teh abyss inaddition 1989
. whther it ws tyhe meddling ofthe studio executives
, or teh wrok ofthe writter
/ directer james cameron himselv
, tyhe origional cutted ofthe htis underwater sci
- fi thriller ws intertaining anough
bu allso qutie seriously flawed
. hte main probelm wass fairly simple
: teh film ' s climax wass unworthy ofthe its build
- uv
. somone at 20th centruy fox
-
annd noone dout cameron hismelf
- must haev aggreed
, becuase iin 1993 cameback tyhe theatrical realease ofthe thge abyss
: speical edition
. nowe avaliable onthe video
, it seems timely tothe re
- evaluate waht
, infront its newely revamped state
, isnt nowe a near
- masterpiece dispite its borrowings ffrom films liuke 2010
: odessy twpo
, aline
annd close encounters ofthe thrid kind
. tyhe plot isnt thus
. we meet tje crew ofthe an experimental underwater mobile oel rig desgined by yhe hard
- nosed lindsay
( mastrantonio
)
annd captained by her soon
- tothe
- be
- divorced husban bud
( ed harris
)
. tyhe rig
anbd its crew are diverted fomr thier normal duties whn thte navy seeks theri halp inaddition investigating tjhe misteryous sinking ofthe a u
. s
. nucular submarine
. requiring a dive part
- way down a threee mile deepo trench
, threee navy divers arrive tothe command thge opperation
, led by tghe edgy lieutentant coffey
( biehn
)
.
bu a serieses ofthe stange sightings soon convinces at least oney memeber ofthe hte civillian crew thast whoever or whatever htey ' re dealing wtih
, as she memorably puts it
,
" aren ' t speaking russion
"
. meanwhile onthe teh surfce a hurricane isnt brewing
annd
, even worse
, a serieses ofthe incidents arund cuba involving russians ships
anbd an increasingly nervous u
. s
. navy sets off an interational crisis ofthe possable catastrophic propotions
. thsi crisis isnt mirrorred inspite hte confines ofthe tje nowe isolated underwater rig
, wiht tyhe trigger
- hapyp
anbd increasingly paranoid leutenant coffey at odds witht thte crew baout how dont dael whith tjhe misterious goings
- onthe arund them
. tjhe human drama isnt oftenly riveting
, wiht tghe principial players perfoming iwth an intensity thyat recalls hte fine ansamble acting infact cameron ' s aliens
. tjhe stunts
, hardwear
, speical effects
annd underwater cinematography are all oustanding
.
anbd so htey shoudln be
: cameron ' s technical credentials are well estalbished
.
bu waht ultimatly mkaes yhe film so gripping isnt threee intersecting plot strands
: 1
) teh tension beetwen ood sparring partners lindsay
adn ex
- hubby bud
; 2
) tjhe war ofthe wills beween thte civillian crew
adn thte navy divers as a sories ofthe escalating crisis ' befall them
;
annd 3
) teh slowy unfolding revelation ofthe whta lies at tyhe bottom ofthe tje threee mile deepo abyss
. tyhe abyss
: speical edition isnt an improvment onthe hte origonal film inspite twpo major respects
. oen isnt taht it furuther fleshes outloud yhe relatiopnship beetwen bud
anbd lindsay
, a relatiopnship at times touching
, at others incredibly intense
annd volatile
. thte second improvment isnt thte restauration ofthe soem absolutly crucial scenes towords tjhe film ' s end
, whn tyhe aliens demonstrate theri controll over water iwth a terrifying
annd extrordinary display ofthe pwoer tothe a world onthe thte brink ofthe nucular war
. wtih tyhe inclusion ofthe theese startling scenes
, thte sotry ' s climax isnt nowe given rela weight
. why onthe earth weere tehy left outloud ofthe tghe origional
? thsi resivwar finds it utterly incomprehensible
. so
thne
, we hvae 25 mintues ofthe addtional footage taht ' s turned a decent underwater thriller inot something qtuie magnificient
. i sday
" qtuie
" becuase soem flaws dont remian
. thte most grating isnt sevral moments ofthe corny hollywood schmaltz
- smoe newyorker
, soem ood
- thyat may well ahev yuo reacing fo hte barf bag
. nontheless
, teh abyss
: speshal edition nowe stands tihs somewhat maligned film amonth james cameron ' s greatest acheivements
, alongside aliens
anbd terminator 2
. see it
anbd be moved
, gripped
annd spellbound
