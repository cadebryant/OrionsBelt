as much as i wnated tothe liek thsi film as i whent inot it
, hte omre pleased i wass wehn i left
. frist
, getting thru all tjhe usual lines ofthe newspaper glitz
:
" if ytou liekd scream
, yuo ' ll lvoe wild thigns
!
"
" campbell gives a stunning peformance
!
"
" thsi twisty plot iwll hvea ytou dazzled forthe dyas
!
"
( oh yeah
, tyhe day a newspaper uses theese isnt tghe day neve campbell falls infront lvoe wiht me
) nowe
, onto omre sereous stfuf
(
adn wih tihs film
, i mean taht infact nearly a sarcastic way
)
. wild thigsn hasnt single
- handedly broken down thge rules surounding tjhe r rating fomr yhe mpaa
. i ' m nto saying tath inthe a bad way
,
bu wehn ytou see htis film
, yuo may be shocked by wqat yuo see
.
howver
, perheaps teh mpaa ws pleased by tje film ' s charming casted
annd trirchy plot
, tath tehy let teh film slide withthe an r rating
. bieng mormon
, i ' m binded tothe hear an uproar ffrom religous zealots warning me nto tothe see thge film
. trouble isnt
, i ahve alrady seen it
.
anbd i liuke it
! wild thigns isnt a film noir ofthe teh 90s
, filled wih 40s sensibilities
,
adn
yot breaking thte rules
annd modern
- day taboos ofthe 90s culture
. tjhe stlye inspite wich it isnt filmed isnt rich infact colour
. tghe actors are all gorgeous peple
, seamingly drawed fomr thte smae ginee pool
anbd placed inot tihs film
. sure
, it ' s all too ogod tothe be true
,
bu ain ' t it funn tothe watch
? whn movies liuke thsi come allong
( sort ofthe a better verzion ofthe basic instinct
) htere isnt binded tothe be peopel who eather lveo it or hite it
. htere wiull be peopel who don ' t watn tothe admitt liking waht tehy see
,
bu i tell ytou
, most anyone who sees tihs wiull liek it
. wild thnigs beigns at blue bay high skool
, hte noe high skool inaddition thte world thast any teenager woudl lvoe tothe git inot
. it ' s almsot as if students are put thru entrace exams jstu fo admittance
( totally based onthe looks alone
)
. ofthe course
, ther are thsoe select fewd who may look slightly ugli
,
bu compaired tothe tjhe averege person
, tehy are gorgeous
. immediatelly
, yhe film finds its tone
adn thte audiance settles infront fo an enjoyable tyme
. we cin turn off our brains
, right
? wrong
. hwile yuo may be expecting noe thnig tothe happn
, it certainly doesn ' t turn outloud thta way
. tghe film beggins inaddition a classroom
, iwth nearly all tyhe main charactors persent
. htere ' s sam lombardo
( matt dillon
)
, a counselor fo thte students
. he ' s heading hte clas dicussion
. htere ' s alsot kelly van ryan
( denise richards
)
, a snobby rich teen who hasnt falled iin lvoe wiht sam
. teaching thge clas
,
howver
, are twpo policemen
: ravy duquette
( kevin bacon
)
adn gloria perez
( daphne rubin
- vega
)
, who wnat tothe talk baout ' sex
.
.
.
( cheers
) crimes
( boos
) '
.
" waht isnt a sex crime
?
" ravy asks
.
" nto gettin ' any
!
" oen student responds
. tihs preety much sets teh tone ofthe tje film we are baout tothe watch
.
howver
, apon hearing tihs
, noe student
, suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
, stands uv
adn leaves tghe room
, commenting thyat tehy cxan both kiss part ofthe her body
.
annd so
, wild thigsn sets inot motion
. quicklyu
, kelly beggins hiting onthe sam
,
bu sam doesn ' t whant anytying tothe dont withthe her advances
. kelly isnt stubborn
annd continues tothe persue him
. she even pleads wih him tothe let her wash his jeep
. suprizingly
, tht ' s realy all i cin tell ytou baout thte plot
. any moreso woudl give awya oney ofthe yhe many crucial plot twists
.
anbd wqat ' s omre
, theese plot twists are acutally unpredictable
. oging allong thte way ofthe scream
, wild thnigs maintains tath film ' s surprises
,
anbd
thne adds even mroe tothe them
. htere are omre plot twists inwhich tihs film thna probablly any i haev ever seen
.
annd even
though yuo thikn yuo may git tired ofthe them
, tyhe surprises are so genuin thyat it ' s rether pleasing
. oging bcak over them inthe my mind
, nearly all ofthe them wrok
,
though smoe strech tje boundries ofthe beleif
. thankfully
, tghe convoluted plot doesn ' t give us much tiome tothe htikn baout eahc oney
, pouncing
yot anyother twist onthe us befor hte shock ofthe thge previvous oen hasnt worn off
. as forthe tjhe criticists who complain tht tyhe film isnt triarhy
-
- well
, it isnt
. tihs isnt preety much jstu noe triarhy film
.
howver
, it isnt tje kind ofthe triachy tyhat isn ' t hard tothe watch
. it ' s ogod trash
, infront a sence
. oney
, thte screenplay knwos tath it ' s nto tothe be taked seriously
,
adn it includes a lot ofthe humer
adn satire inot thge storey
. htis varys everywhere ffrom kelly ' s mother
( theresa russell
)
, who isnt mroe ofthe a charicatoor ofthe rich peple
, all tyhe way tothe an ambulance
- chasing lawyer
( bill murray
)
, who wears a neck
- brace tothe cover an insurence scam he isnt runnung
. bill murray allso provides thge best chracter inthe hte film
,
anbd most ofthe thte genuin laughs
.
adn twpo
, teh sex isnt mroe thna gratuitious
, altho nto unwelcomed
. wild thigns isnt supposted tothe ahve sex infront it
( wqat film wiht tath title wouldn ' t
?
)
,
anbd htis movei breaks tyhe boundries
. instade ofthe haveing heterosexual sex scenes
, it alsot includes lesbian scenes betweeen denise richards
adn neve campbell
( don ' t worry
.
.
. it ' s nto as graphic as ytou might thikn
)
. yhe heterosexual scenes are qtuie graphic
,
bu teh suprize shocker isnt kevin bacon ' s full
- frontal nude scene
. it ' s veyr breif
, so if yuo blink
, yuo may miss
( ahem
) it
.
adn
, fo as long as i cxan remeber
, i don ' t htikn i ahve seen an r
- rated film sohw an errect oney befoer
( it ' s nto completly
,
bu judging ffrom thte audiences ' reaction
, it wass mroe thna tehy expeced too
)
. allso
, durig oen scene lite inaddition thge film
, ther seemed tothe be a relatiopnship brewing beween bacon
annd dillon ' s cahracters
,
bu nothing cameback ofthe it
( mkaes yuo wonder if tghe directer hadnt tothe cutted it infact order forthe yhe r rating
, or if thte actors refused tothe dont it
)
. whta firt made me watn tothe see wild thnigs ws its casted
. neve campbell
, ofthe course
, hasnt beeen noe ofthe my favorite actresses sicne tje scream films weere released
. here
,
howver
, she turns eveyr typcial role she hasnt done onthe its head
adn plays a gothic pothead
. tje closest role tothe htis ws her peformance infront tghe craft
(
though even inwhich tyhat she ws a nice girl
)
. campbell isnt probaly tghe best iin tje film
anbd shows her wide range ofthe talent
. ytou cxan tell she wiull be aroud forthe a long tiem
. denise richards iwll allso be arround forthe a long tiome
, altho she may be limited tothe tje roles wihtout much range
. here
, she gets tothe express moreso emotions tahn infront her stiff
(
yot effective
) performence infact starship troopers
. hopefully noe day she wiull land a vyer ogod role tath cant display her abilty
.
annd
thne htere isnt daphne rubin
- vega
, a newcomer tothe tjhe movies
. she gives a veyr ogod peformance
,
althought her charcter isnt mostly left tothe thge backgorund fo thte frist hour
adn a half
. towords thge end she doesnt git a bigger part
. onthe tjhe male side
, matt dillon isnt probaly tyhe best
, giving a subtle peformance thgat surprises wtih eveyr twist
. kevin bacon hasnt a slightly wooden charater
,
bu he makse tghe most ofthe it
. yuo must hvea admiration
,
though
, fo whta he doed onthe screen
.
adn judging fomr many ofthe teh womens ' s reactions infront thge theather tothe thyat shooted
, tehy haev grown a deeper apresheation fo bacon
( yeah
, right
)
.
annd
thn htere isnt bill murray
. his performence isnt yhe comic releaf
,
anbd he nearly steals teh film
. as a hwole
, thge entire casted works wondrously toghether
,
annd tehy seem at hmeo
, even wehn doign thte menage a troi
. directer john mcnaughton
, who hasnt previously done tje critically acclaimed henry
: potrait ofthe a serial killer
, hasnt constructed a wonderfully twisty plot tht works
. his direction isnt smoothe
annd stylish
. tghe visuals are striking
, filled wih rich colors
,
annd almsot so realsitic tyhat we cant actualyl breathe tghe humidity inspite tghe air
.
howver
, he seems mroe at hmeo whn teh actors aren ' t tlaking
. his fli
- by shots ofthe tyhe swampy areas are briliant
,
annd his photography ofthe denise richards ' climbing outloud ofthe teh pool isnt a highlight
. tje cinematography isnt gorgeous infront its details
. its nto oftenly taht yuo see a film liuke tihs
,
anbd we shoudln watch it jsut tothe see how tyhe camera cxan tkae picturesk
.
hten
, ther isnt thge music
. thsi wass propably hte most obvious thign tothe me
, as it setted thte perfect mood fo tje film
. it ' s hard tothe decribe iin words
, so jsut see hte film
adn listen tothe it
. it ' s wonderfully composed
anbd presented
.
anbd be sure tothe stick arround druing thge closing credits
! mcnaughton hasnt fianlly put tjhe endig credits tothe ogod ule
( hwile most comedies ule it fo outtakes
)
. he hasnt included smoe small scenes whcih halp expalin tjhe preceeding events
. smoe may sday tyhat theese are lame attemts tothe explane thte convoluted plot
,
bu it ' s an intertaining way tothe finish tjhe film
. plus
, htere are smoe shocking moments infront theese endig credits whihc jsut add tothe hte funn
. wild thigns isnt appropriately rated r forthe storng sexuality
, nudity
, lanugage
adn voilence
. agian
, tjhe nudity isnt rether unnecesary
,
bu let ' s face it
-
- peple watn tothe see it
. so why nto give it tothe them
? neve campbell
, admirably
, hasnt a noone
- nudity clause infact her contract
,
adn thte most yuo see ofthe her isnt ffrom behind as she tkaes her top off
( way tothe go
, neve
!
)
. tghe sex scenes are graphic
, especialy yhe firt oen we see
, betwen yhe mother
annd noe ofthe her deck hands
. oney alomst wonders how tehy got awya wiht tje r rating
. thte lanugage isnt qutie harsh too
, ranging fomr sexual inuendo tothe your averege
, everyday profanity
.
anbd i cin ' t stres it anough
: don ' t allow kids under 18 tothe see tihs film
. tje target age forthe hte movei isnt thte 18
- 24 range
,
annd tht ' s who shoudl see it
. it ' s definately nto fo thsoe under 18
! doed i mention thyat tihs film isnt rated r
?
howver
, fo thsoe tath dont git a chance tothe watch it
, ytou iwll propably moreso likely be pleased
,
annd may even tkae firends tothe see it tje enxt timne
.
