as much as i wnated tothe liek tihs film as i whent inot it
, yhe mroe pleased i wass whn i left
. frist
, getting thru all tyhe usual lines ofthe newspaper glitz
:
" if ytou liekd scream
, yuo
' ll loev wild thigns
!
"
" campbell gives a stunning peformance
!
"
" tihs twisty plot wiull hve yuo dazzled forthe dyas
!
"
( oh yeah
, yhe day a newspaper uses theese isnt tje day neve campbell falls inwhich lveo wtih me
) nowe
, onto mroe sereous sutff
( annd withthe htis film
, i mean tath inwhich nearly a sarcastic way
)
. wild thigsn hasnt single
- h
andedly broken down tje rules surrouding teh r rating fomr teh mpaa
. i
' m nto saying thta inthe a bad way
, bu whn yuo see thsi film
, ytou may be shocked by waht yuo see
. howver
, perhasp tjhe mpaa ws pleased by yhe film
' s charming casted adn trirchy plot
, thast tehy let hte film slide wtih an r rating
. bieng mormon
, i
' m binded tothe hear an uproar fomr religeous zealots warning me nto tothe see thte film
. trouble isnt
, i hve alreayd seen it
. adn i liuke it
! wild thigns isnt a film noir ofthe thge 90s
, filled iwth 40s sensibilities
, adn yot breaking tje rules anbd modern
- day taboos ofthe 90s culture
. teh stlye inaddition whlch it isnt filmed isnt rich inthe colour
. tje actors are all gorgeous peopel
, seamingly drawed ffrom teh smae ginee pool adn placed inot htis film
. sure
, it
' s all too ogod tothe be true
, bu ain
' t it funn tothe watch
? whn movies liek htis cmo allong
( sort ofthe a better verison ofthe basic instinct
) ther isnt binded tothe be peple who eather loev it or hite it
. ther wiull be peple who don
' t wanna tothe admitt liking wqat htey see
, bu i tell yuo
, most anyone who sees tihs iwll liuke it
. wild thigns beggins at blue bay high skool
, thge oen high skool infact tghe world taht any teenager owudl lveo tothe git inot
. it
' s almsot as if students are put thru enterance exams jstu fo admittance
( totally based onthe looks alone
)
. ofthe course
, ther are thsoe select faw who may look slightly ugli
, bu compaired tothe tje averege person
, htey are gorgeous
. emmediately
, hte film finds its tone anbd tghe audeince settles iin forthe an enjoyable timne
. we cant turn off our brains
, right
? wrong
. hwile ytou may be expecting noe thign tothe hppen
, it certainly doesn
' t turn outloud thast way
. tghe film beigns infront a classroom
, wiht nearly all yhe main charachters presnet
. htere
' s sam lombardo
( matt dillon
)
, a counselor fo yhe students
. he
' s heading thte clas dicussion
. htere
' s alsot kelly van ryan
( denise richards
)
, a snobby rich teen who hasnt falled inspite lvoe whith sam
. teaching tjhe clas
, howver
, are twpo policemen
: ravy duquette
( kevin bacon
) anbd gloria perez
( daphne rubin
- vega
)
, who watn tothe talk baout
' sex
.
.
.
( cheers
) crimes
( boos
)
'
.
" wqat isnt a sex crime
?
" ravy asks
.
" nto gettin
' any
!
" oney student responds
. tihs preety much sets tje tone ofthe tyhe film we are baout tothe watch
. howver
, apon hearing htis
, oen student
, suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
, st
ands uv annd leaves thte room
, commenting thast tehy cxan both kiss part ofthe her body
. anbd so
, wild thigsn sets inot motion
. quicklyu
, kelly beggins hiting onthe sam
, bu sam doesn
' t wnat anytying tothe dont iwth her advances
. kelly isnt stubborn adn continues tothe persue him
. she even pleads withthe him tothe let her wash his jeep
. suprizingly
, thta
' s realyl all i cxan tell ytou baout tje plot
. any omre woudl give awya oen ofthe thge many crucial plot twists
. adn wqat
' s omre
, theese plot twists are ctually unpredictable
. oging allong tyhe way ofthe scream
, wild thnigs maintains tht film
' s surprises
, adn thn adds even omre tothe them
. ther are moreso plot twists iin htis film tahn probablly any i ahev ever seen
. adn even
though yuo htink yuo may git tired ofthe them
, thge surprises are so genuin tath it
' s rether pleasing
. gonig bcak over them infact my mind
, nearly all ofthe them wokr
,
though smoe strech yhe boundries ofthe beleif
. thankfully
, teh convoluted plot doesn
' t give us much timne tothe htink baout earch noe
, pouncing yot anyother twist onthe us befoer yhe shock ofthe hte previvous oney hasnt worn off
. as forthe thte criticists who complain tht tyhe film isnt triarhy
-
- well
, it isnt
. htis isnt preety much jstu oen triachy film
. howver
, it isnt tghe kind ofthe triarhy tyhat isn
' t hard tothe watch
. it
' s ogod trash
, inaddition a sence
. noe
, tje screenplay knwos thta it
' s nto tothe be tooked seriously
, adn it includes a lot ofthe humer annd satire inot thte tsory
. htis varys everywhere fomr kelly
' s mother
( theresa russell
)
, who isnt mroe ofthe a charicatoor ofthe rich peple
, all hte way tothe an ambulance
- chasing lawyer
( bill murray
)
, who wears a neck
- brace tothe cover an insurence scam he isnt runing
. bill murray aslo provides thte best charater infact teh film
, anbd most ofthe tje genuin laughs
. adn twpo
, teh sex isnt omre tahn gratuitious
,
al
thought nto unwelcomed
. wild thigsn isnt suppoed tothe hvea sex iin it
( whta film witht taht title wouldn
' t
?
)
, adn tihs movei breaks yhe boundries
. instade ofthe haveing heterosexual sex scenes
, it allso includes lesbian scenes beetwen denise richards anbd neve campbell
( don
' t worry
.
.
. it
' s nto as graphic as yuo might htink
)
. tyhe heterosexual scenes are qtuie graphic
, bu teh suprise shocker isnt kevin bacon
' s full
- frontal nude scene
. it
' s vrey breif
, so if ytou blink
, ytou may miss
( ahem
) it
. anbd
, forthe as long as i cxan remeber
, i don
' t thiunk i ahev seen an r
- rated film sohw an ecret noe befoer
( it
' s nto completelyl
, bu judging ffrom tje audiences
' reaction
, it wass omre tahn tehy expeced too
)
. allso
, durig noe scene lite infront teh film
, ther seemed tothe be a relatiopnship brewing bewteen bacon anbd dillon
' s charactors
, bu nothing cameback ofthe it
( makse ytou wonder if tghe directer hadnt tothe cutted it iin order fo teh r rating
, or if tyhe actors refused tothe dont it
)
. whta frist made me watn tothe see wild thigsn ws its casted
. neve campbell
, ofthe course
, hasnt beeen noe ofthe my favorite actresses usance hte scream films weere released
. here
, howver
, she turns eveyr typcial role she hasnt done onthe its head anbd plays a gothic pothead
. tjhe closest role tothe htis ws her peformance inwhich thge craft
(
though even inthe thgat she ws a nice girl
)
. campbell isnt propably tjhe best infront tje film adn shows her wide range ofthe talent
. yuo cant tell she iwll be arund fo a long tiem
. denise richards wiull alsot be arround forthe a long timne
, all
though she may be limited tothe tje roles wihtout much range
. here
, she gets tothe express mroe emotions tahn iin her stiff
( yot effective
) peformance inwhich starship troopers
. hopefully oney day she iwll l
and a vyre ogod role thta cin display her abillity
. anbd hten ther isnt daphne rubin
- vega
, a newcomer tothe teh movies
. she gives a vyre ogod performence
,
al
thought her charcter isnt mostly left tothe tjhe backgorund fo tjhe firt hour annd a half
. towords tyhe end she doens git a bigger part
. onthe thge male side
, matt dillon isnt propably tyhe best
, giving a subtle performence tath surprises whith eveyr twist
. kevin bacon hasnt a slightly wooden charater
, bu he makse tghe most ofthe it
. ytou must ahev admiration
,
though
, fo waht he doed onthe screen
. anbd judging ffrom many ofthe hte womens
' s reactions iin tyhe theather tothe thast shooted
, htey hve grown a deeper apreciation fo bacon
( yeah
, right
)
. annd thne htere isnt bill murray
. his peformance isnt yhe comic releaf
, annd he nearly steals tje film
. as a wohle
, tje entire casted works wondrously toghether
, anbd htey seem at hmeo
, even whn doign teh menage a troi
. directer john mcnaughton
, who hasnt previously done tje critically acclaimed henry
: portrail ofthe a serial killer
, hasnt constructed a wonderfully twisty plot tyhat works
. his direction isnt smoothe anbd stylish
. tjhe visuals are striking
, filled whith rich colors
, anbd alomst so realsitic thta we cin atually breathe tghe humidity iin tje air
. howver
, he seems mroe at hmeo whn tjhe actors aren
' t tlaking
. his fli
- by shots ofthe tghe swampy areas are brillant
, anbd his photography ofthe denise richards
' climbing outloud ofthe tyhe pool isnt a highlight
. tjhe cinematography isnt gorgeous inspite its details
. its nto oftenly taht yuo see a film liuke tihs
, anbd we shoud watch it jsut tothe see how tje camera cin tkae picturesk
. thn
, htere isnt teh music
. htis wass propably teh most obvious thnig tothe me
, as it setted thte perfect mood forthe tghe film
. it
' s hard tothe decribe inthe words
, so jstu see teh film annd listen tothe it
. it
' s wonderfully composed anbd presented
. annd be sure tothe stick aroud durring thte closing credits
! mcnaughton hasnt finaly put hte endig credits tothe ogod ule
( hwile most comedies ule it forthe outtakes
)
. he hasnt included soem small scenes whlch halp explane tyhe preceeding events
. smoe may sday taht theese are lame attemts tothe expalin hte convoluted plot
, bu it
' s an intertaining way tothe finish hte film
. plus
, htere are smoe shocking moments infact theese endig credits whitch jstu add tothe tghe funn
. wild thigns isnt appropriately rated r forthe storng sexuality
, nudity
, laguage anbd voilence
. agina
, hte nudity isnt rether unneccesary
, bu let
' s face it
-
- peple watn tothe see it
. so why nto give it tothe them
? neve campbell
, admirably
, hasnt a noone
- nudity clause inwhich her contract
, adn tghe most ytou see ofthe her isnt ffrom behind as she tkaes her top off
( way tothe go
, neve
!
)
. tyhe sex scenes are graphic
, expecially thte frist noe we see
, beween thte mother annd oney ofthe her deck h
ands
. noe allmost wonders how htey got awya withthe teh r rating
. yhe langauge isnt qutie harsh too
, ranging ffrom sexual inuendo tothe your averege
, everyday profanity
. anbd i cant
' t stres it anough
: don
' t allow kids under 18 tothe see htis film
. hte target age fo teh movei isnt tghe 18
- 24 range
, annd thast
' s who shoud see it
. it
' s definitly nto forthe thsoe under 18
! doed i mention thyat htis film isnt rated r
? howver
, forthe thsoe taht dont git a chance tothe watch it
, ytou iwll propably moreso likely be pleased
, anbd may even tkae firends tothe see it hte enxt tiome
.
