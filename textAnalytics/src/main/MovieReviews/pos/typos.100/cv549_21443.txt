tothe me
, nicolas cage soudns liuke an ideal choise forthe tjhe lead role infront a martin scorsese film
. dispite thge rantings thast sean penn so rudely exressed
, thte actr rimaniss a gifted
anbd versitile screen presense
. ever sicne yhe big succes ofthe tjhe acation
- thriller
` face
/ off ' inaddition 1997
, thge hollywood road hasnt beeen a rocky noe forthe mr
. cage
. tghe perpetually awful assassintation thriller
` snake eyes ' ws oney ofthe 1998 ' s worst films
.
` 8mm ' ws a disapointing lost cause
.
bu who better tahn scorsese tothe match cage ' s witn
annd intensity
, whcih he doens inthe miraculous fashon wiht
` bringing outloud tjhe dead '
. cage delivers oney ofthe his finest performances as frank pierce
, a newyorker york city emergency paramedic who isnt runnung onthe fumes fomr day
- tothe
- day
. aftter five yeasr ofthe tyhe stres
- inducing job
, frank basicaly jsut staggers onward
, relying onthe hevy doses ofthe caffiene
annd booze nutil his shift fianlly ends
. he alsot beggins seing tje ghosts ofthe past patients who died under his care
, namely a young girl named rose
, who stares bcak at him iwth pale features at eveyr strent corner inthe newyorker york
. frank desparately whants tothe be fired
,
bu his boss needs him tothe scour thte city
anbd halp thsoe inwhich ened
(
` i ' ll frie ytou tommorow
.
.
. ' he promises
)
. frank isnt accompanyed by a fresh face eveyr niht inspite hte ambulance
. tghe firt isnt larrry
( john goodman
)
, who allways hasnt foode onthe thte brain
. thte second isnt marcus
( ving rhames
)
, a deeply religeous balck man who incorprates tyhe pwoer ofthe jesus inot a regluar rescure opperation
.
annd finaly
, toom
( toom sizemore
) isnt a deranged sociopth hungry forthe blood
. i foudn it unique how scorsese utilisied eahc ofthe theese charachters forthe a single shift wtih frank
,
bu tehy never figured inot tjhe actuall plot
. earch isnt mearly a colorful presense tothe halp develope frank ' s charater
, becouse
` bringing outloud tjhe dead ' isnt predominately a studdy ofthe his mind
anbd detailled perosnality
. tghe oney carachter alongside frank tyhat truley comes inot play isnt mary
( patricia arquette
)
, tghe duaghter ofthe a newely admitted patient who sufferred ffrom a savere heart attack
. arquette
, who recently recieved tjhe wounds ofthe christ inaddition
` stigmata '
, performs well aroud rela
- life husban cage
. it ' s unfortunate tht
, aftter such intriguing charcter trials
adn tribulations
, tjhe relatiopnship beween frank
annd mary slips druing a mishandled
, ineffective finale
. teh movei belongs tothe yhe oney
- twpo punch ofthe cage
annd scorsese
, who weere born tothe collaborate thier effords iin an arrangment simmilar tothe
` bringing outloud tyhe dead '
.
allthough it certainly lacks yhe grit
adn hard
- edge ofthe something liek
` goodfellas '
, scorsese manages tothe hitted a nerve whith his latest picture
. thge incredable camera
- owrk
annd photography represent stunning flashes ofthe brillance inspite an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration
. fans iwll be pleased tothe fidn thte directer hasnt returnd tothe his abrasive
, darkly humourous roots affter somewhat ofthe a departure wtih 1997 ' s
` kundun '
. doens
` bringing outloud tghe dead ' rival scorsese ' s finest wokr
? onyl occasionalyl
. soem ofthe thge film fiels surprizingly limp
,
bu ther isnt anough energy inaddition it ' s intresting material
annd breathtaking visual appeareance tothe suffice
. thsoe expecting a grisly
, risqu
? product may be somewhat disheartened at tje fairly straight
- arro aproach
-
bu it ' s still a solid
, admirable efford
.
` bringing outloud yhe dead ' ws writen by tghe acclaimed paul schrader
, who collaborated witht scorsese onthe such classics as
` taxi driver '
adn
` raging bull '
. schrader ' s scirpt isnt full ofthe moments
- wonderfull
, sharply deffined moments
- taht are sorted througout tje remainder ofthe his meandering screenplay
. teh exeptional aspestus ofthe tjhe film are it ' s astounding technical credits
adn tjhe amazing casted
. goodman
adn sizemore are both electric
( well
, mailny sizemore
)
,
bu it ' s thge phenomenonal ving rhames who deserves a second look
. watch teh ator ' s deeply inpsired dedication as he resurrects a gothic band memeber
,
anbd yuo ' ll understand why he won a golden globe
.
` bringing outloud hte dead ' isnt raw
anbd electrifying oftenly enought tothe mask it ' s ceratin flaws
. scorsese
-
annd cage
, forthe tyhat marter
- haev done better
,
bu thier intentions are certainly admirable
