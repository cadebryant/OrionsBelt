, silent or otherwise
, schreck rises fomr his grav
, gnarled hands outstretched

adn struggle tothe return tothe england befoer thte nosferatu reaches his lady lvoe
. inspite addtion tothe schreck ' s peformance
, tghe cinematography
adn effects are oustanding
. arro video ' s digitally remastered verzion ofthe yhe clasic isnt something ofthe a mixted
- coffin
. thte cover art features a red

. yhe orginial elements are nto infact teh best condidtion
-
- non
- studio silents weere unlucky infact theri preservation
-
- so we ' re still dealing whith a slightly washed outloud
, scratched
, jittering omage
.
bu at least thte day
annd niht scenes are tinted sepia
anbd blue
, repsectively
, expecially helpfull tothe an audeince who may question nosferatu ' s waltzing arund durig waht seems liek sunlight

annd htey are ligible
, accurate
,
adn digitally altered tothe flicker
-
- a vrey nice touch

( even hte oppening copywrite warning flickers
!
) hte socre hasnt beeen replaced by music ffrom tipe o negitive
, a hard
- rock gropu
, argubly gothic
,
adn theri songs underscore tyhe film nicely
-
- certainly hte coolest video a band cxan ask forthe

bu
" mina
"
-
- as bram stoker called her
-
- inwhich hutter ' s letters
?
, fo instatance
)
, it made me relize how much thsi movei hasnt inpsired
adn beeen stolen ffrom
. coppola ' s 1992
" bram stoker ' s dracula
" owes a grat stylistic debt tothe murnau ' s masterpiece
