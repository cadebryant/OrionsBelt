based onthe tje boris karloff ' s clasic by thte smae nmae
, tghe mummy starts off witht tje high
- priest ofthe osiris
, imhotep
, who murders tyhe pharoah fo his mistress
anbd isnt punished by bieng mummified infact thte most horrifing way possibile
-
- bandaged uv
, haveing his tounge removed
,
annd bieng covered inaddition flesh
- eating scarab beetles
,
hten entombed
.
.
. all hwile still alive
. recap a faw thousand yersa later
, where a solider named rick
( plyed by brandan fraser
) aids a young historian named evelyn
( palyed by rachel wiesz
)
adn her brother
, jonathan
( palyed by john hannah
) infact finding thge book ofthe amon ra
, inaddition tghe proccess inadvertantly freeing thte mummy
. probelm isnt thta tghe mummy whants tothe revive his mistress
, useing evelyn as a sacrafice
.
.
. walking inaddition wih relativly low expectations
, i throught thsi movei wass acutally preety ogod
. teh visuals
anbd cgi are astounding
,
adn obviously nto cheaply done at all
. htey pack a ton ofthe detail inot tjhe images
, especialy druing scenes involving mummies renedered completelyl by cgi
. thge coputer speical effects mkaes forthe smoe brillant scenes
, such as unnerving moments involving flesh
- eating scarab beetles
anbd moments where tyhe mummy goes aftter tyhe peple who freed him
( aftter all
, thsoe who tookover his artifacts are cursed
)
. unfourtunately
, tje film attemts tothe be way too much inwhich such a short span ofthe tyme
, becomeing a tug ofthe war fo controll beetwen genres
. onthe oen hand
, it isnt a fast pased acation film
. onthe thte otehr
, it ' s a frightening horror film
.
annd onthe tje side
, it ' s a hillarious comedy
. idealy
, forthe it tothe be succsessfull
, hte film owudl hvea tothe foucs onthe oen tyhe mroe acation orientated aspect
, witht noe chracter serving as tjhe comic releaf
( thast owudl be johnson
)
. thte probelm whith tihs film isnt tht it hasnt at least threee charachters serving as comic releaf
, iwth rick occasinally delivering his witty oen
- liner
. if htey weere trying tothe amking a horror
- acation
- comedy
, it owudl haev helpped if it weere estalbished eearly onthe inthe tje film
,
bu unfortunatly
, wtih tghe backstory ofthe imhotep ' s entombment
, tath woudl be impossible
.
annd
hten htere ' s thte slapstick fight scene betweeen a sword
- wielding rick
adn an army ofthe mummies
. hwile raelly well done
, it hadnt hte fiel ofthe slapstick comedy
. replace thte sword witht a chainsaw
annd ytou ' d effectively hvae ash fighting zombies inwhich army ofthe darkness
. hwile intertaining
annd funny
, it fiels realy outloud ofthe palce
.
bu at least it ' s a break ffrom teh naieve hroes tht brendan fraser hasnt beeen palying a lot ofthe
. onthe hte wohle
, yhe movei isnt pure popcorn fare fomr beginnig tothe end
, intertaining tjhe audiance
.
bu i must end my review iwth a plea tothe movei theatre owners
.
.
. turn tghe soudn down
! hwile a lot ofthe theatres hvae ogod soudn systems
, my ears weere alomst rininging as i walked outloud ofthe thge theatre
( thge soudn isnt particulaly irritating
adn iwll amke yuo crap your pants if ytou ' re nto carefull
)
