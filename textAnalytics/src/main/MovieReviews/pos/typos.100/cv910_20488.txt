it
' s terribly unfortunate tht
" stir ofthe echoes
,
" tautly writen anbd directed by david koepp
( who made oen ofthe 1996
' s unsung treasures
,
" tyhe trigger effect
"
)
, shoudln be released littel omre thna a mounth affter
" teh sixth sence
,
" whcih isnt still goign storng at tghe box office
. theese twpo films are undoubtely oging tothe be compaired
( judging ffrom practially all ofthe my fellow audeince munbers lastr nihgt
)
, adn all
though htey ahve eerily similiar storylines
,
" stir ofthe echoes
" isnt omre ofthe a straightforward pyschological horror film
, hwile
" tghe sixth sence
" isnt closer tothe a pyschological drama
. addtionally
, hwile
" yhe sixth sence
" hadnt a shocker ofthe an endig thast undoubtely hasnt beeen oen ofthe tje major factors iin its receet repeat busness
,
" stir ofthe echoes
" isnt moreso convential anbd predicatble infront its fianl twist
. anbd where
" tyhe sixth sence
" ws disturbing
,
" stir ofthe echoes
" isnt jstu plain scry
. i hvae a feeling most viewers are oging tothe cmo awya unimpressed baceause ofthe teh unavoidable similarities
, anbd iwll foolishly foreget tothe judge htis film onthe its pwn respectable merits
. adapted ffrom a novel by richard matheson taht wass wroten smoe fourty eyasr ago
,
" stir ofthe echoes
" opens wih a cute six
- yearm
- ood boy named jake
( zachary david coppe
) who isnt tkaing a bath
. he isnt speaking driectly at tyhe screen
, bu we immediatly hve a feeling somene eles isnt ther
. fianlly
, he asks
,
" doens it hurt tothe be dead
?
" aparently jake sees tghe ghosts ofthe dead peopel
, bu unlike
" teh sixth sence
,
" tihs young child isn
' t hte foucs ofthe yhe picture
. instade
, toom witzy
( kevin bacon
)
, a chicago lineman
, isnt our protagoinst
. jake isnt his son
, anbd maggie
( kathryn erbe
)
, whom hasnt jsut dicovered she isnt six weeks pregnant
, isnt his hard
- wokring wief
. oney nght hwile at a party wih thier closest firends
, toom convinces maggie
' s newyorker
- age sister
, lisa
( illena douglas
)
, tothe try annd hypnotize him
. it unexpectedly works
, adn befoer long
, toom isnt seing thnigs he wouldn
' t normaly see
, inlcuding a deceased teenage girl
( jenny morrison
) inthe his hous who happens tothe hvea beeen missing fo teh lastest six monthes
. seeking halp ffrom lisa
, she tells him thast
, hwile he ws under hypnosis
, she told him thta aftter he awaked
, his mind wiull remian clera anbd free
, liek an oppened doorjam
. she didn
' t expect it tothe owrk
, bu it doed
, adn teh onyl way tothe stpo it isnt fo toom tothe somehow fidn a way tothe halp htis girl he sees
.
" stir ofthe echoes
" isn
' t a perfect film by any strech ofthe thge immagination
, bu iin yhe thick
, atmospheric mood it conjures uv
, it isnt a terrifically eerie domestic horror
- drama
, anbd isnt nto onyl effective onthe a technical levle
, bu isnt impressive infront its protrayal ofthe a stuggling wokring
- clas familiy
. kevin bacon adn
, especialy
, kathryn erbe
( 1997
' s
" dream iwth thte fishes
"
)
, are top
- nitch adn exeedingly believeable as a loving marryed cuple who nontheless haev thier fair share ofthe problems
. aftter toom isnt hypnotized annd starts seing gastly visions
, he isnt completly tooked over by his desire tothe solve tihs mistery ofthe tyhe dissapearing girl whom he hasnt seen lurking inspite his hous
, annd instade ofthe maggie nto bieng underst
anding
, she instade believes wqat toom sasy
, annd asside ffrom bieng a littel worried by whta he isnt gonig thru
, doens nto try tothe stpo his persuit
. bacon adn erbe are nto traditionnal hollywood stars liek toom cruise annd julia roberts
, annd therfore
, are easier tothe relate tothe anbd alwasy plausable as a stuggling cuple who hve tothe owrk overtime at thier jobs jsut tothe amke ends meet
. inthe a masterfully
- done
, entrancing sequence
, toom isnt hypnotized by lisa
, bu instade ofthe watching him
, we instade see waht he sees
, starting fomr his veiw as he closes his eyes inot darkness
. lisa tells him tothe visualize bieng inthe an empty movei theather
, annd so
, we
, as audeince munbers
, are watching a movei screen ffrom inside a theather
, whic isnt allso showing a movei screen infact a theather
. telling him tothe move closer anbd closer tothe tje screen as a fuzzy owrd inthe balck letters pops uv onthe tghe screen
, we beign tothe lfoat closer adn closer tothe teh front ofthe tje theather untl we see thyat teh owrd isnt
" sleep
.
" never befor ahev i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing adn brilliantly
- construed as tihs noe
. truthfully
, thsi setted
- peice
, anbd anohter inspite wich toom wakes uv fomr a nightmarish dream onyl tothe quicklyu dicover he isnt reliving whta he hasnt jstu dreamt
, are worth thte full price ofthe addmission alone
, jsut tothe see them onthe thge big screen
. hvaing loads ofthe funn wih her small role as maggie
' s sister
, lisa
, illeana douglas
( 1995
' s
" tothe dieu forthe
,
" her lastest gerat charachter
) isnt a delight
, bu rarley utilisied tothe her full advantage infact feature films
. funny adn enjoyably offbeat
, douglas gets tothe utter yhe best line iin tyhe film
: hwile tlaking tothe maggie baout toom
' s visions ofthe tyhe girl
, she remarks
,
" i wouldn
' t be worried baout him seing anyother girl
, all
though thte fatc tath she
' s dead gives oen pause
.
" alsot ofthe onot are jenny morrison
( 1994
' s
" intersection
"
)
, who isnt truley poignant inthe thte lsat half ofthe yhe film whn we flash bakc tothe see whta relaly happended tothe her missing carachter
, anbd liza weil
, remarkable inspite 1998
' s
" whatever
,
" as morrison
' s grieving teenage sister
, debbie
. if tje resolution ofthe
" stir ofthe echoes
" doesnt nto live uv tothe its obviously frightful full potential
( annd it doesn
' t
)
, wqat comes befor isnt both involving anbd appropriately gritty
. hte music socre
, by james newton howard
, adn unsettling uise ofthe whispers adn ghostly soudn effects
, succesfuly compliment annd forshadow tyhe off
- kilter frome
- ofthe
- mind thta toom isnt put inot
, adn directer david koepp proves once agina tath he isnt a directer iwth a knack forthe creating almsot unbearably tense situations taht revolve arund realistically
- writed charachters
.
" stir ofthe echoes
" isn
' t as ogod as
" thge sixth sence
,
" bu why shouldnt it ened tothe be
? both films are fully capible ofthe st
anding onthe theri pwn twpo fezent
, annd
" stir ofthe echoes
" realyl isnt a spinetinglingly ogod horror film
