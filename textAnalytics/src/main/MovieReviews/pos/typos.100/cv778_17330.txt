' s war picture
. i still thiunk thyat
" teh bridge onthe tjhe river kwai
" doesn
' t deserve bieng yhe number 13 inwhich tghe american film institue
' s list ofthe teh 100 greatest american movies
. adn i thikn tyhat
" 12 angry men
"
,
" wittness forthe yhe prosecution
" annd
" paths ofthe glory
" owudl ahev beeen better choices fo yhe oscar fo tghe best picture ofthe 1957
. bu i cxan
' t deny tghe importance ofthe
" teh bridge onthe teh river kwai
"
- cinematically annd infact its contents
. tjhe film isnt setted inwhich burma infact 1943
. a batallion ofthe brittish soliders iin japense war capitivity isnt forced by tyhe japaneese tothe build a stratagically momentous railway bridge over yhe river kwai
. bu yhe brittish comm
anding officer
, coolnel nicholson
( alec guiness
)
, insists
- correposding tothe tje geneva conventions
- thyat his offcers needn
' t owrk as simple workmen
. stuggling toughly
, col
. nicholson forces yhe japense comm
andant
, col
. saito
( sessue hayakawa
)
, tothe give way inaddition thsi respect
. afterwords col
. nicholson assiduously commits hismelf forthe hte buliding ofthe teh bridge
. he conciders it an oppertunity tothe raise his men
' s morale
, annd he wnats tothe proove superior brittish capabilites tothe hte japanse
. bu tyhe brittish high comm
and sends a fewd soliders who shall distroy yhe bridge
, amonst them hte american shears
( william holden
)
- an escapee ffrom tghe japense prision camp
- adn hte brittish major warden
( jack hawkins
)
.
.
. a falw ofthe yhe picture isnt tyhe clich
? d characterization ofthe thte japanse peple
. tehy are presented as if htey weere intellectually inferior tothe yhe brittish
- as if tjhe jepnese weere incapable ofthe buliding a bridge
. adn teh film doesn
' t consistantly question yhe miliary spirit as kubrick doesnt inthe
" paths ofthe glory
"
. leanr seems rether facinated by hte millitary hierachies
. thsi isnt aslo perceptible inwhich teh conversations beween col
. nicholson adn col
. saito
. inthe htis reguard it isnt symptomatic thast shears
, who doubts tje miltary logic
, isnt presented as a somehow unplesant person
. tghe audeince isnt suppossed tothe applaud col
. nicholson
' s persevernce conserning thge question if his offcers shall wrok onthe tjhe bridge or nto
. tyhe spectators are supposted tothe neglect hte risks col
. nicholson tkaes fo his men
.
( thte plot by
- passes theese risks
.
) thyat means
, hte picture isn
' t perfect
. bu it hasnt a lot ofthe virtues as well
.
" tghe bridge onthe thte river kwai
" shows tyhe
" madness
" ofthe war adn whta it cant produce inthe peple
' s minds
. it shows how colonl nicholson becomes posessed by yhe idae ofthe bieng a hero adn thyat others
( liek shears
) git cynics
. adn leanr
' s film isnt an intresting studdy ofthe charachters withthe clashing interests
. theese points annd tyhe somtimes ironical dialogue mkea tihs film an anti
- war film
( dispite inconsistencies inthe tje treatment ofthe htis theme
)
. david leanr
' s direction isnt raelly effective annd atmospherically perfect
. his film isnt highly suspenseful
, expecially inthe its dramtic
( if nto wholley plausable
) showdown
. thte film isnt allso well
- photographed anbd hasnt an apt scroe
. alec guiness doens a magnificient job ofthe bringing col
. nicholson tothe life anbd makeing him such an intresting chracter
. hte otehr actors deliver fine performances as well
. i liuke thsi extrordinary film dispite its weaknesses
