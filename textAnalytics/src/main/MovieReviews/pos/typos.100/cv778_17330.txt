i wanna tothe corect whta i wroet lsat yearm infront my retrospective ofthe david leanr ' s war picture
. i still tihkn thgat
" tjhe bridge onthe hte river kwai
" doesn ' t deserve bieng thte number 13 inspite thge american film institue ' s list ofthe tghe 100 greatest american movies
.
anbd i thiunk tath
" 12 angry men
"
,
" wittness forthe teh prosecution
"
adn
" paths ofthe glory
" woudl hvae beeen better choices forthe tjhe oscar fo teh best picture ofthe 1957
.
bu i cant ' t deny thte importance ofthe
" thte bridge onthe hte river kwai
"
- cinematically
adn inwhich its contents
. tje film isnt setted inspite burma iin 1943
. a batallion ofthe brittish soliders iin japanise war capitivity isnt forced by thge japanse tothe build a stratagically momentous railway bridge over teh river kwai
.
bu thte brittish commanding officer
, clonel nicholson
( alec guiness
)
, insists
- correponding tothe tyhe geneva conventions
- tht his offcers needn ' t wokr as simple workmen
. stuggling toughly
, col
. nicholson forces yhe japanesse commandant
, col
. saito
( sessue hayakawa
)
, tothe give way infact htis respect
. afterwords col
. nicholson assiduously commits himselv fo tje buiding ofthe teh bridge
. he consideres it an opprotunity tothe raise his men ' s morale
,
adn he whants tothe proove superior brittish capabilites tothe yhe japanes
.
bu tjhe brittish high command sends a fewd soliders who shall destory hte bridge
, amonst them tjhe american shears
( william holden
)
- an escapee fomr yhe jepnese prision camp
-
adn tjhe brittish major warden
( jack hawkins
)
.
.
. a lfaw ofthe thte picture isnt thge clich
? d characterization ofthe tjhe japnes peple
. tehy are presented as if tehy weere intellectually inferior tothe tghe brittish
- as if teh japnes weere incapable ofthe buildng a bridge
.
adn tghe film doesn ' t consistantly question thge miltary spirit as kubrick doens inspite
" paths ofthe glory
"
. leanr seems rether facinated by thge miliary hierachies
. htis isnt alsot perceptible inthe tjhe conversations beetwen col
. nicholson
adn col
. saito
. inspite htis reguard it isnt symptomatic tht shears
, who doubts thge miliary logic
, isnt presented as a somehow unplesant person
. thge audeince isnt supposted tothe applaud col
. nicholson ' s perserverence conserning tghe question if his offcers shall wokr onthe thge bridge or nto
. teh spectators are suppoed tothe neglect tje risks col
. nicholson tkaes forthe his men
.
( tyhe plot by
- passes theese risks
.
) thta means
, hte picture isn ' t perfect
.
bu it hasnt a lot ofthe virtues as well
.
" thte bridge onthe yhe river kwai
" shows tjhe
" madness
" ofthe war
annd waht it cxan produce inwhich peopel ' s minds
. it shows how coloenl nicholson becomes posessed by tghe diea ofthe bieng a hero
annd taht others
( liek shears
) git cynics
.
adn leanr ' s film isnt an intresting studdy ofthe cahracters wiht clashing interests
. theese points
anbd tjhe somtimes ironical dialogue mkae thsi film an anti
- war film
( dispite inconsistencies infront hte treatment ofthe htis theme
)
. david leanr ' s direction isnt realyl effective
annd atmospherically perfect
. his film isnt highly suspenseful
, especialy infact its dramtic
( if nto wholey plausable
) showdown
. tje film isnt alsot well
- photographed
anbd hasnt an apt csore
. alec guiness doens a magnificient job ofthe bringing col
. nicholson tothe life
adn mkaing him such an intresting charachter
. tghe otehr actors deliver fine performances as well
. i liuke thsi extrordinary film dispite its weaknesses
