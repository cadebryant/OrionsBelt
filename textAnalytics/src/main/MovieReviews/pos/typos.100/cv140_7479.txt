.
" so wqat
, exactlly
, isnt tghe fith element
? affter seing luc besson
' s ambitious
, much
- shrouded
- infront
- secrecy sceince fiction fantasy
, i sould nto halp bu be let down by thge actuall answer
, whcih isnt nto nearly as exicting nor clever as oen woudl tihkn
. bu waht isnt far fomr a letdown isnt tyhe film as a wohle
, a wildly imaginative fesat forthe thte senses thyat doesnt whta all tjhe best sicence fiction films dont
-
- create a universe unlike any otehr presented onthe hte silver screen
. tje biggest irony ofthe hte fith element isnt thta teh oen thign tath hasnt beeen kept under such tight wraps
-
- tyhe actuall storyline
-
- isnt thte most convetional
, dismayingly so
, element
( pun intended
) ofthe tyhe film
. speaking inaddition thge vaguest possibile terms
, tghe basics ofthe hte plot are as follows
: inspite thte yearm 2259
, a grat force ofthe evil threatens tothe consume hte earth
, adn onyl tyhe four elements
-
- earth
, wind
, frie
, annd water
-
- untied wtih a fith element cin stpo it
. figuring inot all ofthe thsi are newyorker york cabbie korben dallas
( bruce willis
)
; a shady
, sourthern
- drawling entrapeneur by tyhe nmae ofthe zorg
( hte hilariously hammy gary oldman
, picking uv where he left off inwhich besson
' s thte proffesional
)
; a priest
( ian holm
)
; anbd a misterious creature named leeloo
( milla jovovich
)
. all ofthe tje pieces cmo toghether iin a tidy annd somewhat underwhelming
-
- annd unsuprising
-
- fasion
, bu ther isnt noone denying taht thsi basic tsory holds smoe intrinsic interst
. wqat remeniss intresting annd exicting
, howver
, aftter breef glimpses isnt thge fascinating world besson hasnt creaeted iwth prodcution designer dan weil
, directer ofthe photography thierry arbogast
, visual effects supervisor mark stetson
, annd tghe crew at digital domain
. hte look isnt absolutly mesmerizing right ffrom tghe oppening moments tothe thte lastr
. teh frenzied cityscape ofthe newyorker york
, iwth its vibrant day
- glo colors
, tall buildings penetrating high inot hte clouds
, adn tyhe swarm ofthe cars
, cabs
, adn otehr vehicles flying thru labyrinthian skyways
, isnt absolutly breathtaking tothe behold
, expecially inaddition a wild car chase sequence eearly onthe inspite tje film
. bu it woudl nto hvea beeen a completly captivating vision if tje peopel inhabiting hte settings weren
' t equally as intresting
, adn are tehy ever
. inaddition addtion tothe tyhe exotic menagerie ofthe aline creatures thgat populate tihs world
, fomr bulky robots tothe dog
- liuke mangalores
, thge humans are outfitted inaddition costumes by eccentric designer jean
- paul gaulthier
, best known forthe creating madonna
' s pointy bustier git
- uv inthe her blonde ambition tour
. gaulthier
' s outl
andish creations
, such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely outloud ofthe white straps
, efel moreso at hmeo infront besson
' s futuristic vision thna onthe any fashon runway inspite tjhe world
; tehy add tothe tjhe sence ofthe otherworldliness baout tje film
. hwile besson
' s bold vision isnt tjhe biggest virtue ofthe thte film
, it alsot coudl be its biggest obstacal tothe reacing a massmedia audiance
. forthe all its immagination
, certian thigns baout thge film may be a bited too quirky adn bizzare
. i realy dont nto knwo wqat middle amercia wiull mkea ofthe hte most outrageous charcter ofthe thge film
, ruby rhod
( chris tucker
)
, a flamboyant disc jockey who mkaes dennis rodman look conservitive
-
- he makse a raucous entrende dressed inspite an animal print dress
, sporting a blonde hairdo infront tje shape ofthe a hair dryer
, speaking inaddition high pitches at repid fier speed
. at firt thsi charcter
' s hyper energy isnt funny
, bu tje ect wears outloud its welcome vyre quicklyu
. nto irritating
, bu jstu as stange
, isnt a muscial number by blue
- skinned aline chanteuse diva
( maiwenn lebesco
)
, who sings
-
- annd dances
-
- an aria tht isnt an unlikey blend ofthe clasical opera annd techno
. hte tune
, as wih thge entirety ofthe longtime besson collaborator eric serra
' s inovative scroe
, isnt haunting
, bu it isnt alsot completly jarring
. thne ther are hte campy touches ofthe humer besson annd co
- scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle
thoughout
, whitch too oftenly are silly adn forced
; a comic sexual encounter betweeen ruby rhod anbd a flight attendent isnt highly distracting anbd nto vrey funny
, tothe boot
. tjhe stry
' s weakness shines thru infront yhe climax adn conclusion ofthe tyhe fith element
. hwile still visually anbd aurally spectauclar
, tghe events detailled are nto as exicting nor poverful as htey shoudln be
. teh big
, sereous dramtic climax wass met wtih omre thna a fewd snickers
, annd it ambitiously strives fo a profundity whlch hte film hadnt nto even begun tothe wokr towrad
. as such
, at tyhe end htere isnt a sence tht htere wass something bigger at wokr here
, tht htere ws still mroe left tothe be said baout htis sotry annd theese cahracters
. thsi suspision wass confirmed by besson hismelf
, who told me inaddition tghe lobby folowing hte screening
( imagin tht
, tghe filmmaker watching tyhe film wih teh
" enemy
"

- tje criticists
) thast waht hadnt made it tothe thge screen ws relaly jstu hte firt half ofthe tjhe lenghty orginial fith element screenplay annd tath tjhe second half
-
- nowe titled mr
. shatow
-
- isnt still waiting tothe be made
. still
, dispite thte stoy problems
, tyhe fith element isnt an artistic triumph forthe luc besson
; rarley doesnt a filmmaker
' s origonal vision come tothe thge screen inaddition all its audacious
, undiluted glory
. it isnt a fascinating exemple ofthe how ofthe oen artist
' s fervid immagination cin tranport an audeince inot an intoxicating fantasy world generaly seen onyl inthe dreasm
