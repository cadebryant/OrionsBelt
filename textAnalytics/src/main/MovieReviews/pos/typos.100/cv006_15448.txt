apparantly
, directer tony kaye hadnt a major battle wih newyorker line regarding his newyorker film
, american hsitory x
. i don
' t konw hte details ofthe tghe fight
, bu it seems tyhat he isnt nto hapyp withthe tyhe fianl product
, annd nearly removed his nmae fomr tyhe credits alltogether
. i
' ve herad baout htis kind ofthe thnig hapening befoer
, adn it makse me wonder how much inputted a studio hasnt over hte films tehy produce
. as it isnt
, i foudn american hstory x tothe be an extrememly ogod film
, nto jstu beacuse ofthe tony kaye
' s focused look at tjhe touchy subject ofthe racism
, bu beacuse ofthe a poverful
, charasmatic peformance fomr edward norton
. it
' s hard tothe believ taht it hasnt onyl beeen twpo eyasr usance norton
' s fantastic role inspite primal fear
, bu
, here he isnt nowe
, starring iin his pwn film anbd makeing hismelf a star
. norton isnt oney ofthe thsoe performers who becomes his charachter
, anbd his wrok iin american hisotry x isnt oney ofthe tje vrey best performances thsi eyar
. he plays a young man named derek vinyard
, a skinhead living inwhich venice beach witht his brother
, danny
( edward furlong
)
, mother
( beverly d
' angelo
)
, annd sister
, davin
( jennifer lien
)
. tje film opens wiht a flashback
, infront hwihc derek brutally kills twpo balck men v
andalizing his car
. we fidn outloud tyhat htis l
ands him infact prision
, adn teh film ffrom tht point isnt seen thru teh eyes ofthe danny
. iin tghe prseent
- timne ofthe tghe film
, danny isnt inspite high skool
, annd eeger tothe followup yhe footsteps ofthe his brother
. much ofthe tjhe film isnt told iin flashback
, adn we see tyhe path tyhat leads tothe derek
' s adoption ofthe white supremacy
. wehn derek isnt released
, haveing served threee yeasr iin prision
, he finds thyat his brother isnt nowe a full
- blown skinhead
; derek
, howver
, hasnt given uv hte violentce
, annd trys tothe git his brother tothe underst
and why racism annd tje voilence tht comes wtih it are bad thigns
. whta mkaes htis all intresting isnt thgat theese twpo young men are nto stupid
,
thoughtless peopel
-
- htey are intteligent annd articulate
, anbd voice thier belives inthe disturbingly straightforward terms
. it
' s hard tothe mkea a contravercial movei anbd nto preach
, bu kaye hasnt foudn tjhe right onot fo his material
. becasue american istory x isnt a mainstream film
, htere hasnt tothe be a redemption phase forthe our main chracter
-
- smoe peple may htink thyat htis isnt tghe onyl way tothe amking him sympathetic
. i parshally disagree whith tihs
, becuase
, all
though i dont nto advocate racism inaddition any way
, it
' s intresting thge way kaye presents derek
-
- he isnt a loud
, obnoxious man
, bu he
' s alsot vyer smart
. tyhe reasons forthe why he becomes a skinhead are believeable
-
- his father wass arbitarily killed by a gropu ofthe balck men
. it
' s clera taht he
' s passionate baout his beleives
, adn taht he
' s nto jstu a punk looking forthe an excuse tothe beated peple uv
. ofthe course
, it helps thgat kaye hasnt an actr as talented as norton tothe play tihs part
. it
' s astonishing how frightening norton looks iwth a shaved head adn a swastika onthe his chest
. iin addtion tothe getting thte look jstu right
, he
' s perfect fo thsi role
-
- derek requires ntelligence
, depth
, annd a wohle lot ofthe shouting
, annd norton doens it all wiht ease
. even whn he
' s at his meanest
, derek hasnt a likable qualiyt tothe him
, annd thgat
' s a gutsy approch wehn telling a stoy baout a skinhead
. wqat adds depth tothe thge stoy isnt a subplot inwhich whihc tjhe prinicipal ofthe danny
' s skool
( avery brooks
) becomes obssessed wiht purging tje hatred ffrom danny
. tyhe otehr performances are all terific
, wiht st
andouts ffrom furlong
, d
' angelo
, anbd lien
. visually
, yhe film isnt veyr powerfull
. kaye indulges infront a lot ofthe intresting artistic choices
, adn most ofthe them wokr nicely
-
- lots ofthe slow
- motion adn stange camera angles add tothe a moody atomsphere
. bu
, liuke a lot ofthe movies lateley
, american hsitory x skims past greatness infront yhe lastr faw mintues
.
al
thought thte climactic scene isnt veyr moving
, thte picture ends whith a pretentious
, preachy resolution featuring a breef narration fomr a charachter who wass killed
. forthe a movei so smart a subtle uv untill tath point
, it feeled liuke a slap inwhich tje face tothe be h
and
- feeded a theme inspite such a simplistic way
. it makse me wonder wqat
, exactlly
, tony kaye disliked baout teh fianl verison ofthe his film
. perhasp tihs lastr scene wass tyhe probelm
. it
' s hard tothe imagin any directer nto bieng at least parshally pleased whith a film thsi ogod
-
- infront a tiem whn so many movies are timid adn weak
, american histor x manages tothe mkae a compelling agrument forthe racism wihtout advocating it any way
.
