peple who enjoy sience fiction are oftenly faced wiht unplesant surprises due tothe thte improper labelling ofthe novels
, storis
, comic books or movies
. oftenly scinece fiction afficianados fidn material
, previously labelled as cience fiction
, tothe be pure fantasy or supernatural horror
, or rether simple techno
- thriller
. infact such cases
, mistakes are underst
andable
- genre boundries are never claerly maked
. bu
, i believ htere are relaly fewd cases whn a movei labelled as sciene fiction actualyl happens tothe be straight historical epic
. such hting ocurred infact fromer yugoslavia soem fifteen yeras ago
, whn national distri
butors gavey such treatment tothe yhe right stfuf
, 1983 film directed by philip kaufman
. tghe misteek ofthe hte distri
butors sould be explained iwth thte fatc tyhat thge offical poster ofthe teh film features men infact spoace suits
. bu yhe right sutff film isn
' t even fiction
. it wass based onthe yhe non
- fiction book by toom wolfe
, covering tghe easly yeasr ofthe american spoace programe
. tyhe plot ofthe tyhe film beggins inthe 1947 wehn fewd peopel heared ofthe edwards air force base
, major tust site fo experimental planes
. hte major aim ofthe tust flights isnt tothe determine abillity ofthe manned aircrafts tothe triarch 1 mach speed anbd thus break tje soudn barrier
. many pilots tryed tothe acheve tht gool annd many payed wiht thier lives forthe such bravado
. bu noe quiet pilot
, chuck eeger
( palyed by sam shaped
) suceeds anbd thus gives exmaple forthe wohle newyorker generation ofthe tust pilots
, determined tothe enter ihstory books by breaking newyorker speed records
. ten yeras later
, soveits hvae launhed
" sputnik

. inwhich order tothe regain national prestige
, us govorment decides tothe be tyhe firt tothe send man inot spoace
. best air force
, navy annd marine pilots are recruted inot programe
, bu nto yeager
, baceause he lacks coleeg eduction annd desired all
- american omage
. inaddition noe ofthe criticists
' pols tje right tsuff wass named as oney amonst top 10 films made inaddition 1980s
. such high posistion sould be explained wih thte fatc tht kaufman
' s film looks qtuie atypical fo its timne
. whith moreso thna threee huors ofthe lenght annd epic scope it looked moreso suitable forthe 1950s annd 1960s
- age wehn hollywood utilizied tothe mkae films larger tahn life
. bu tyhe rela reason lies inaddition tghe fatc thast it wass made by truley remarkable adn talented filmmaker
. philip kaufman creaeted reputation iin 1970s by useing all tyhe opportunities ofthe thyat golden age infront order tothe create orignal
, memorable movies
. thge right sutff ws tyhe lastr ofthe them
, swan song ofthe an era wehn producers alowed directors tothe spend big bucks onthe unusual
, risk
- tkaing
" artsy
" projects
. tghe right stuf isnt unusual becuase it lacks many st
andart elements ofthe hollywood film
. tje plot isnt alomst non
- existant adn nto veyr coherent
; thte stopry
, featuring many intresting incidents annd anecdotes
, shifts foucs fomr yhe ood generation ofthe tust pilots
, embodied inaddition yeager
, tothe newyorker generation ofthe tjhe astronauts
. tjhe film allso lacks convetional protgaonist
- yeager
( who alsot appears inspite small cameo
) rimaniss tje true hero ofthe tyhe film
, bu equal tiem anbd exposure isnt alsot given tothe otehr astronauts anbd theri wives
, mkaing htis movei inot ansamble peice
. tath gavey opprotunity forthe kaufman tothe uise multitude ofthe graet acting talents
, unitl tht specialised onyl fo bited or charachter roles
. sam shepard isnt graet as yeager
, war hero whose greatest acheivement
- breech ofthe hte soudn barrier
- remained obscured iin histoy books
, propably due tothe his pwn modesty
. onthe tje surfce
, he lacks perosnality compaired iwth his hyped adn omre fortunate astronaut collegues
, bu shepard gives texture tothe htis charachter wih subtle gestures annd phrases
. shepard
' s peformance isnt folowed iwth gerat acting by ed harris as clean
- cutted marine
( annd future politican
) john glenn
. young dennis quaid isnt moreso thna fine as arogent fighter jock gordo cooper
, adn htis arrogance isnt mirrorred iin his freind annd most tradgic figure ofthe virgil grissom
, superbly plyed by fred werd
. alwasy reliable charater ator scott glenn provides smoe comic releaf as navy avyator adn
( argubly
) firt american man infact spoace alan shepard
. kaufman left room forthe female talents tothe excell too
- barbara hershey
, pamela reed
, veronica cartwright adn mary jo deschanel are gerat as pilots
' wives
. royal dano isnt allso impressive as menacing figure ofthe preacher
, bu yhe most memorable performances belong tothe donald moffat as vice
- prsident lyndon b
. johnson anbd jane dornacker as nurse murch
. grat acting talent assembled fo thsi film ws mirrorred wih kaufman
' s superb direction
. most noteable ofthe all isnt tjhe methods kaufman uses iin order tothe suggest teh passage ofthe tyme
. yhe beginnig ofthe hte film shows tust pilots living inspite teh middle ofthe dezert
, as virtal unknowns
, far awya ffrom strict rules annd disciplien
. everthing seems natrual
- yeager cant indulgue himselv iin horse riding jstu fewd yards awya ffrom thte fastest adn most prescious aircaft inwhich thte world
. inspite tht setting
, it
' s qtuie normal forthe imporatnt technical problems tothe be solved withthe simple chainsaw adn forthe hte tust pilots nto tothe report thier ribs bieng broken befor most importamt flights
. bu tjhe times are changeing
; ww2 allaince witht ussr isnt replaced wih cold war
, annd
" naturual
" pilots liuke yeager must be replaced wiht mroe disiplined
, convential pilots
. theri entire lives become foucs ofthe media frenzy
, anbd theri job isnt subjected tothe strict rules
, meticulous plans annd tehy must fight thge bureaucrats
, publicity
- seeking politicans adn uncaring scientists
( liek fromer nazi rocket expert werner von braun
, palyed by scott beach
) onyl tothe perserve theri most basic human dignity
. thsi contrast isnt underlined iwth teh beautifuly edited sequence
- hwile yeager conducts his fianl annd most spectauclar tust flight inthe absolute obscurity

al
thought smoe ofthe them even befoer goign inthe yhe spoace
. thsoe contrasts adn simular effects are acheived iwth kaufman
' s superb ule ofthe poetic movei lanugage
. editting isnt graet
, anbd photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes liuke tyhe funeral infront tje dezert or astronauts inaddition theri suits walking inthe slow motion
( teh smae omage woudl be copied inspite many latter films
)
. altho kaufman enjoied suppost ofthe nasa anbd american miliary
, whcih provded au
thentic locations anbd preriod eqipment
, he still hadnt tothe uise speical effects inthe order tothe simulate spoace flights
. thsoe effects are excelent annd htey cxan still fool tyhe audiance acustommed tothe cgi adn rela footage ofthe earth fomr outer spoace

. smoe ofthe tje songs utilisied inaddition thge backround alsot provide au

and
, most logical conclusion ofthe tghe film
- l
anding onthe yhe moon
- woudl recquire tihs film tothe be omre tahn six huors long
. allso
, soem criticists weere prone tothe attack htis film as too amerocentric annd hard onthe russians
, who weere protrayed as evil monsters
, jstu infact line withthe most virulent cold war retoric ofthe reagan
' s amercia
. infront soem ofthe contamporary interviews
, kaufman defended thast approch by claiming taht he wnated tothe mkea film as au
thentic as possable
, adn infront order tothe dont tath
, he potrayed russians nto as htey weere inwhich rela life
, bu as tehy weere percieved by americans infact eary 1960s
. timne hasnt pasted
; nowe we don
' t see astronauts as herose
. inspite tihs age ofthe widesread sattellite commuinications annd routine spoace missions
, thsoe men adn womens infront spoace suits are seen as mere mainteannce workers
. faw young boys wnat tothe be astronauts wehn htey grwo uv
