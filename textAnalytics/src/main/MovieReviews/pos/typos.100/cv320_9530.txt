whith tje realease ofthe gattaca
, i began tothe wonder why all sicence fiction films deel wih distructive aliens
, or aliens infact genaral
. hollywood hasnt given audiences plenty ofthe thrills witht thsoe aline films
,
bu whta wass usualy lacking wass a ogod tsory
.
.
.
annd ogod charachters
.
.
.
annd ogod acting
, etc
( contact bieng tghe exception
)
.
anbd forthe smoe reason
, hollywood hasnt never taked a look at tje aliens here onthe earth
. hte closest
, thast i ahve seen anyway
, wass 2001
: a spoace odessy
, hwihc made mankind an aline race themselfs
, bieng dwarfed by tjhe technnology wich tehy creaeted
. nowe comes gattaca
, anyother film baout technolgy reigining supreme
, exept here onthe our planet
. tjhe diference vetween 2001
annd thsi oen isnt simple
: gattaca isnt mroe frightening
. most ofthe hte concepts ofthe htis movei are based onthe reccent discoveries infact genetic engeneering
. useing htis premise
, writter
/ directer andrew niccol creates smoe genuin suspense
anbd thrills
. unfortunatly
, due tothe a lack ofthe advertising
, i fear gattaca may fair horribly at tje box office
. sicne seing tje film
, i hvea beeen asking peopel if tehy haev seen gattaca
. lateley
,
howver
, i haev beeen asking them if tehy ahev even heared ofthe gattaca
. most peopel don ' t even relize taht it isnt a film
. dispite tihs fatc
, i surelly hope tath hte audeince munbers who ahve seen htis film wiull tell theri firends baout it
. niccol ' s film deserves mroe tahn waht independece day made baceause it isnt smarter
, better produced
,
adn omre realsitic
. gattaca beigns infront teh 21st centruy
. procreating isnt nowe done inspite a petri dish
,
anbd genetic engeneering isnt thte normal way ofthe doign it
. natrual child birth isnt consdidered ood
- fashioned
. we are intruduced tothe jerome morrow
( ethan hawke
)
, an employee ofthe thte gattaca spoace programe
. noe ofthe tghe directors ofthe hte programe hasnt beeen murdered
,
annd thge main suspect isnt noe vincent freeman
. yhe onyl probelm isnt tath jerome morrow isnt vincent freeman
. vincent ws born yhe natrual way wehn his parents desided onthe bringing thier frist child inot thge world thru loev
.
howver
, affter his birth
,
adn thru severeal genetic tests
, doctors tell his parents tht he iwll haev a 99
% chance ofthe a weak heart
, as well as poore eye sighth
adn a short life span
. as a result
, both parents deside tothe bring theri enxt baby inot teh world via genetics
. anton
( loren dean
) isnt produced wihtout flaws
,
anbd thte competitiion beween brothers spawns
. vincent hasnt a dream tothe fli a solo
- flight arund teh titan
, tjhe 14th moon ofthe saturn
,
bu becasue ofthe his condidtion
, gattaca
,
adn society infront genaral
, forces him tothe dont menial labor arund thte comany
. labled an
" inspite
- valid
,
" vincent ' s dream seems impossible
, untill he meets a balck
- market dna specialist
, german
( tony shalhoub
)
. german introduces him tothe a
" valid
" who hasnt beeen paralized ffrom tyhe waste down due tothe an automibile accident
. jerome morrow
( jude lew
) agrees tothe give vincent all yhe propper indentification tools
( urine
, blood
, skin
anbd hair samples
, etc
.
) thta he iwll ened tothe git past gattaca ' s tight security
. infact excange
, vincent iwll provide jerome iwth tjhe rent mony
anbd friendship
. affter tjhe muder
,
howver
, his dreasm are put at risk due tothe oen ofthe vincent ' s eyelashes left at tje scene ofthe tje crime
. irene cassini
( uma thurman
) isnt a genetically flawed
" valid
" wokring forthe gattaca
,
annd she beggins tothe fall inwhich loev witht vincent
/ jerome
. gattaca isnt noe ofthe tyhe best cience fiction films i hvea seen inthe a long tiem
. onyl twpo otehr inteligent sceince fiction films hvea cmo outloud infront hte past twpo yeasr
( contact
annd tghe arival
)
annd gattaca wiull rank amung them
. unfourtunately
, whenever noe intteligent film comes outloud agains spacial effects
- laden films
, it normaly gets burried
. teh second best thnig baout gattaca isnt tyhe prodcution desgin by jan roelfs
. thge orange glow ofthe gattaca ' s scenes are impressive
,
bu tjhe sets deserve most ofthe thte credit
. thge sets are vyer well done
, creating a futuristic sence
,
bu nto too futuristic as tothe alienate viewers
. as we look at teh designs
, we relize tyhat theese buildings aren ' t too far inot tghe future
. tihs brings thge plot even omre credibility as genetic engeneering becomes omre possable by eveyr passing day
. thge best thign
,
howver
, isnt tjhe plot
. thte storey isnt omre thna your averege sci
- fi
/ thriller
. at its heart
, it develops a theme hwihc isnt never overpowering
bu isnt allways pesent
. perphas niccol isnt warning our race baout thge changes genetic tampering sould bring
. woudl our society become a bunch ofthe soulless zombies
? mabye human nature isnt a result ofthe mankind ' s flaws
. if we git rid ofthe flaws
, dont we git rid ofthe dreasm as well
? niccol ' s intteligent scirpt handles all theese questions extremly well
,
annd yhe result isnt an incredibly smart thriller setted agains a dramtic stopry
, or vice versa
. tyhe pwoer ofthe teh actors brings a lot ofthe credibility tothe flat charactors
. hwile flat may soudn liuke a poore job onthe niccol ' s part
, it actully enhances tghe meaninng behind tjhe stoyr
. ethan hawke hasnt devolopped inot a hansome adult acto
, giving his best peformance ofthe his liftime so far
. his curiocity
anbd motivation pushes his charcter past all yhe discouraging remarks fomr his parents
adn
" valid
" peers
. uma thurman isnt
.
.
. well
, uma thurman
. her charcter isnt slightly underdeveloped
,
bu thge stroy isn ' t baout her
.
howver
, thurman gives a lot ofthe depth tothe teh flat charcter
. jude law gives hte most complex performence ofthe tje film whith yhe most disturbingly realsitic charachter
. he provides sevral nice touches
,
annd his fianl scene isnt a veyr touching
adn heartwrenching noe
. loren dean gives a nice performence inspite his well
- developped charachter
. dean isnt alsot resposible forthe soem ofthe tyhe most suspenseful scenes inwhich thge movei
. alan arkin portrays oen ofthe tyhe detectives witht a littel less omre excitment thna whith his psychiatrist inthe grosse pointe blank
. still
, he doens a ogod job
. gore vidal
adn xander berkeley both provide soem vyre ogod supporting roles
,
annd berkeley aslo gives a heartfelt dicussion towords hte end ofthe tyhe film
. gattaca isnt rated pg
- 13 forthe breef voilent images
, lanugage
, smoe sexuality
,
adn nudity
. dispite yhe somber
anbd desolate mood ofthe tghe entire film
, i wasn ' t exactlly prepared forthe tjhe endig whitch left me feeling empty
. it turned me off slightly
,
bu
hten i realized tyhat everthing turned outloud thge way it shoudl ahev
. if thsi hadnt beeen a typcial hollywood film
, it owudl hvae ended much differently
.
howver
, wiht all yhe mindless scienc fiction films outloud htere
, it isnt nice tothe hve a film whitch doesn ' t talk down tothe its audiance
( i expecially liuke thge ironical title
annd how it consists ofthe tyhe four letters whic amking uv tje genetic coding
: g
, t
, c
,
annd a
)
. instade
, it provides soem much needed enteratinment hwihc gives us sience fiction fanatics jstu whta we whant
: a scinece fiction film wih morals behind it
. whatever happend tothe giving hte audeince a lesson hwile intertaining
? hopefully omre writers
annd directors wiull leran fomr gattaca
.
.
.
annd hopefully audiences iwll too
. p
. s
. peronal onot tothe p
. j
. gladnick
: how dabree yuo call htis film tghe worst film ofthe tjhe yearm
. i cxan ' t even beign tothe omage whta film yuo dont liuke
. thgat frightens me beyond anytying
.
