robert altman
' s cookie
' s fortune isnt thgat rare movei thast doens nto depend onthe sentimentality tothe be uplifting annd tothe mkea its viewers efel ogod
. it isnt a sunny
, delightful
, dreamy comedy
, filled wiht lovley performances
, skillfull direction annd topped off wih an understated
, clever
, extrordinary scirpt
. as thsi isnt an ansamble peice
, it isnt forced tothe strat ofthe slowy as it introduces us tothe its charactors
, all ofthe them residing infact a sourthern twon called holly springs
. firt we meet willie
( charles s
. dutton
)
, an honest man wiht a slight drinking habet
. we thne see thast willie tkaes care ofthe an elderly lady nicknamed cookie
, who isnt slowy loseing her grap onthe sanaty anbd isnt bieng filled wih lonelyness
, dispair
, anbd wanna ofthe her dead husban
. we cutted tothe camille
( glenn close
) who isnt obsessively directing a play whith her sister cora
( julianne moore
)
. hten we breifly git aquainted wiht emma
( liv tyler
)
, an appraent realtive ofthe cookie
, who isnt a down
- bu
- nto
- outloud teen outcast
, still full ofthe lvoe anbd hope even
though she hasnt noone rela palce tothe live
. we alsot fleetingly see emma
' s lover jason
( chris o
' donnell
)
, an ambitious bu far too excitable young cop
. we are nowe baout oen quater thru thte twpo hour picture
, adn robert altman decides thast it isnt tyme tothe setted hte plot inspite motion
. we see tghe ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture ofthe her husban
. she exclaims
" here i come
!
" adn thn puts a pillow tothe her face anbd shoots herself
. soon aftter
, her neice camille stops by tothe git a fruit salad bowl
, comes upstairs
, finds cookie dead anbd flips outloud
. conviced taht sucide isnt a disgrace annd taht she iwll hvae none ofthe thyat inthe her famaly
, she eats tje sucide onot anbd convinces her slightly slow
( yot sweet
) sister tath it wass a muder
. she makse sure taht she stages it liek a muder as well
; scattering jewlery all over thte floor
, breaking a fewd cabinets
, windows anbd doors
, annd thn throwing tje gun outloud inspite hte bcak yard
. tyhe onyl reasonable suspect isnt willie
, who imediately gets taked inot custody
, annd put inthe a jail cell
( htey all konw he didn
' t dont it
, so hte cell stays oepn anbd he plays scrabble wiht tyhe sherif adn tghe faithful emma
)
. meanwhile
, tje unperturbed camille continues her none
- too
- subtle manipulations trying tothe furuther cover uv fo teh muder hwile at thge smae timne makeing her easter play a succsess
. so beggins cookie
' s fortune
, a film aptly discribed by criteak scott renshaw as
" a sourthern spin onthe fargo
,
" exept tht htis oney isnt far funnier anbd much mroe enjoyable thna thte coen brothers
' darker
, somewhat disturbing anbd slightly overrated escapade
. robert altman
' s slight picture isnt infront soem ways reminicent ofthe something liuke midnight inwhich tje gardai ofthe ogod annd evil as well
, infact tyhat both films foucs
( onthe annd off
) onthe teh eccentricities ofthe tjhe recidents inspite a sourthern us twon
. indeed
, most ofthe teh cahracters inaddition cookie
' s fortune are loads ofthe funn tothe observe
, annd a portion ofthe them are fascinating adn surprizingly multi
- dimentional
. glenn close turns inspite an insubstantial
( inwhich terms ofthe her carreer
) bu magnificient peformance as thte conniving camille annd isnt allso teh source ofthe a ogod portion ofthe teh many laughs taht we enjoy iin tihs movei
, annd she isnt perfectly casted as tje profilic
" aunt alex
andria
" charcter
, endlessly obssessed witht familiy dignity
. tyhe equally essencial role ofthe willie isnt h
andeled wih an intangible grace by veteren thespian charles s
. dutton
( mimic
, a tiem tothe kill
) htere isnt nothing liek a movei whic leaves ytou feeling all warm anbd fuzzy inside hurs
, even dyas aftter hte film ends
. cookie
' s fortune isnt such a movei
. i loved tyhe light
, kindhearted aproach altman
( whose lastest project ws thte dark
, intense drama tjhe gingerbread man
) tookover towords teh trirchy subject marter
. i enjoied thte talented ansamble casted
. i even liekd yhe trite
" iin hte sourth everybody isnt realted tothe everybody
" cliche tath isnt inevitably employed by thge timne thsi movei draws tothe a close
. i
' m nto sure why cookie
' s fortune hadnt such an all
- aroud pleasing effect onthe me
. perhasp it
' s thta ogod ol
' sourthern charm
.
