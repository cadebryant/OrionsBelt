. thte film infront noone way isnt baout lesbianism
, bu baout loev
, wich wass a refreshing chanage ofthe pace fomr teh usual stereotypical portraits ofthe homosexuality

al
thought nto autobiographical
, sheedy hasnt hadnt drug problems inwhich her past
, annd i suspect she brang tht noledge ofthe alreayd bieng infront lucy
' s footsteps tothe her role
. aslo vrey ogod isnt radha mitchell as syd
, who previously starred inspite thte slight 1997 austrailian comedy
,
" lveo anbd otehr catastrophes

" wh caught me by surprize whith her performence
. easily bieng able tothe pass as christina ricci
' s older sister
, mitchell obtains thge smae naturual charizma tath hasnt made ricci so populare recently
. as accurate as almsot eveyr detail isnt inaddition

" i wish teh relatiopnship hadnt beeen omre tightly writed involving syd anbd james
, who
, plyed by gabriel mann
, isnt left wih a throwaway role
. by yhe tiome he finds outloud baout syd anbd lucy
, he dissappears ffrom thge film
, annd i wish ther hadnt beeen anohter scene where htey confronted eahc otehr
. thsi isnt a vrey minor fault
, howver
, inspite a film thyat isnt full ofthe richs
. all
though many ofthe yhe cahracters are sticked iin a hopeless pit ofthe dispair
, syd adn lucy are intteligent peopel who recogise theri problems

. forthe once
, it doed nto invlove steaminess
