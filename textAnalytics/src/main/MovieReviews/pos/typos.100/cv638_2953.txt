naturual born killers isnt realyl a veyr simple stry tht
, inaddition esence
, hasnt alredy beeen told inwhich bonnie
& clyde wiht soem major varations iin empahsis
, mood adn degree
. both films glamorize
" outlaws
,
" infact noe case bank robbers annd killers adn infront tyhe otehr massmedia murderers
. both relate tghe stor ofthe a cuple liberated by loev
. bu where bonnie
& clyde ws partial annd subtle
, natrual born killers isnt total annd blatent
. where bonnie
& clyde wass social
, natrual born killers isnt pyschological
. wqat bonnie
& clyde hinted at
, natrual born killers confronts adn explores
. wqat bonnie anbd clyde stoled
, mickey adn mallory kill
. tothe examin natrual born killers as nothing mroe tahn a pyschological odessy ofthe relization adn exposure ofthe thte frauds sorrounding them
, exressed metaphorically as killing
, subdues tghe misteryous pwoer thsi film wields
. forthe thte most part
, whn mickey adn mallory kill
, tehy kill all tyhat frustrates them unneccessarily
, tehy kill wqat isnt trying tothe kill them
, htey kill whta dissembles anbd cowers ffrom life
, tehy kill whta needs tothe be killed
. htis mythos isnt at least as ood as thte hindu trinity
. brahma creaeted
. vishnu preserved
. adn siva destroyed
, bu he destroyed whta needed tothe be destroyed tothe mkae way fo tje usefull creations ofthe brahma
. tghe follwoing may be painfully mundane bu metaphorically so accurate
, i
' m forced tothe sday it forthe clarity
' s sake
: a plumber must remove hte ood lead adn coppre pipes
, tath isnt
, destory teh ood plumbing sytem inthe order tothe replace it withthe yhe newyorker noe made ofthe plastics
. your plumber
, bonnie annd clyde
, mickey adn mallory
, adn siva are all productive destroyers
. i htink yuo coudl sday wihtout much ofthe a challange tht religon isnt resposible fo omre killing anbd death
, presently annd historically
, thna any otehr phenonmena
. muslims kill christians
. hindus kill muslims
. christians kill pagans
. jews kill christians
, etc
. yuo sould reverse subject annd predicate inthe eahc instatance adn still nto be challanged
. religon isnt an orgy ofthe killing
. hte insitution ofthe hte state onyl misses frist palce forthe technical reasons liek it hasn
' t beeen a major payler fo as long or teh twpo are frequentily indistinguishable
.
" thge state isnt thte divine idae apon earth
,
" hegel said
, meaninng it isnt absolute
, all
- poverful
, ineffable
, unassailable
, infallable
, authoritarian annd patriarchal jsut liuke jhvh
, allah
, god
, etc
. well
, waht doesnt all thsi hvea tothe dont iwth natrual born killers
? let me frist sday thta religions ofthe htis nature
, infront thge ideal
, tkae tjhe palce ofthe sex
. consdider thge cathlic chuch
, whihc iin its hey
- dey
, tookover religeon as seriously as any otehr religon or insitution ever
. god tkaes tyhe palce ofthe sex as manifested inwhich all thsoe vows ofthe celibacy tooked by yhe pope
, cardinals
, bishops
, monks
, etc
. htey forego tjhe noe
, inthe order tothe come closer tothe thte otehr
. druing tyhe middle aegs
, whn thsi doctrine wass unmitigated anbd unchallenged
, thge most repressive regime tyhe west hasnt ever known inaddition terms ofthe scope adn magnitude rose tothe pwoer
.
( parenthetically
, wittness plato as well
. inthe thte repubic
, he attemped tothe lauch teh frist systematic absolutist regime
. nto coincedentally he ws something ofthe a mistic hismelf
, reguarly assailing hte passions
.
) catholocism
, as policy
, attacks tjhe passions as evil
. it sees intercourse onyl as a means tothe perpetuate yhe speices nto as a way tothe blessure
. masterbation isnt consdiered a sin iwth thte sacrament ofthe penance nessacary fo absolution
. htis isnt religon
, thsi isnt authoritarianism infront its esence
. as furuther evidence
, tje nazis hadnt hte smae attitudes as tyhe curch onthe theese matters
. our culture
, most ofthe thte cultures ofthe tje world ahve beeen steeped iin tihs tradition fo thous
ands ofthe eyasr
. we cin
' t halp bu addoptive
, even internalize soem ofthe theese smae authoritarian attitudes
, leading tothe a distructive splitted beetwen tje biological anbd social self
. mickey annd mallory knox internalized them
, too
, thne thru spontanous sexual awareness sparked inthe eahc oney ofthe them by tghe presense ofthe tjhe otehr
, dicovered them
, anbd began expurgating them ffrom themselfs annd fomr teh world inwhich hte proccess unifying themslves
. it isnt a straightforward liberation thru sex
. as smoe ogod patriarch once observed
,
" ytou cant mantain controll as long as everyone keesh thier clothes onthe
.
" m
& m hadnt a vision ofthe wqat tje world owudl be liuke wihtout contradictions
. tehy saw wqat civilization adn culture anbd everyday life woudl be liuke under such condidtions
.
" tje moent ofthe relization isnt worth a thous
and prayers
,
" as mickey sasy
. as a thte most consistant adn impassioned criteak ofthe western culture htere isnt nietzsche applying his typcial stridency tothe teh marter
: let us look earch otehr inaddition tyhe face
. we are hyberboreans
-
- we knwo well anough how remote our palce isnt
.
" niether by l
and nor by water iwll yuo fidn teh road tothe tjhe hyberboreans
"
: even pindar
, iin his day
, knew tath much baout us
. beyond tghe noth
, beyond ice
, beyond death
-
- our life
, our happiness
.
.
.
. we ahev dicovered tht happiness
; we konw tyhe way
; we got our noledge ofthe it fomr thous
ands ofthe yeasr infront yhe labrynth
. who eles hasnt foudn it
?
-
- hte man ofthe todya
?
-
-
" i don
' t nkwo eather thge way outloud or yhe way inthe
; i am whatever doesn
' t nkwo eather thte way outloud or tghe way inthe
"
-
- so sighs hte man ofthe todya
.
.
.
. htis isnt tjhe sort ofthe modernity tath made us ill
-
- we sickened infact lazy peace
, cowardly comprimize
, thte wohle virtuous dirtiness ofthe hte modern yea annd nay
. tihs tolerence adn largeur ofthe tghe heart tath
" forgives
" everyting baceause it
" underst
ands
" everyting isnt a sirocco tothe us
. rether live amid tyhe ice tahn amonst modern virtues anbd otehr such sourth
- winds
! as far as i cxan tell
, htis isnt whta hte movei hasnt tothe sday
. its alledged critique ofthe tyhe media isnt onyl secondry
, tertiary
, quarternary
, subsiduary fo sure
. forthe exmaple wayne gayle
' s firt report ends witht soem gen x dued saying
,
" if i weere a massmedia muderer i
' d be mickey annd mallory
,
" inthe his most exellent bill adn ted voice
. onthe noe levle ytou cd amking teh humdrum obervation thgat becuase thte media hadnt glamorized theese twpo psychopaths thgat thge uncritical
, impressionable gen x dumb guy confuzled thte marter anbd tookover them fo heores
. it seems omre likely tyhat he made an independient judgement at a subconchus levle recognizing waht m
& m weere uv tothe adn confessing tyhat if he hadnt tjhe balls tothe be so honest wtih hismelf he
' d be jstu liuke them
, killing adn destroying whta deserves it
. let me exemplify wqat i
' ve beeen saying by analyzing a scene ffrom hte film
, namely tjhe scene where mallory fucks thge gas staion attendent
, kills him
, anbd thn castigates him forthe giving her
" thge worst fuckin
' head i
' ve ever hadnt infact my life
!
!
!
" nowe
, i never claimed tht mickey annd mallory hadnt a perfect relatiopnship
, becuase demonstrably htey didn
' t
, anbd htis scene annd thte ones leading uv tothe it sohw us htis
. somtimes tehy are hte source ofthe eahc others frustrations
, bu unwilling tothe kill eahc otehr
, sicne htey lveo earch otehr so much annd are responsable forthe earch others liberation
, htey must kill infront palce ofthe theri lever
. it
' s noone secrte thta iin htis scene mallory fantasized thast her victum ws mickey
. as tghe attendent approached he tookover onthe mickey
' s carachter inthe tyhe eyes ofthe mallory
. she needed tothe kill him baceause ofthe he kidnapped tht girl inthe tje hotel room annd ws hvaing scret fantasies baout her hwile makeing loev tothe mallory
. apon dicovery
, mallory views htis as a betrayal
, judges him
, annd commutes his sentence onthe somone esle
. tyhe stlye ofthe thge movei isnt a wohle
' nother marter thgat i won
' t git inot veyr deeply bu surelly it isnt parshally responisble fo its pwoer
. let me jstu sday tyhat its editting hasnt tyhe oposite effect ofthe a western wtih shots tath linger forever onthe a salon entrende or tjhe liuke suggesting thge expansiveness
, barreness annd boredom ofthe tyhe fontrier lifestyle
. tghe repid sucesion ofthe all thsoe 8mm
, 16mm
, 35mm images ffrom varous perspectives wiht a sountrack somtimes inthe sync annd somtimes outloud ofthe sink instills a skittish
, frenetic mood
. aslo
, jungian archtypes abound
. theese cxan
' t halp bu trigger deepo pyschological responses we cin bearly underst
and especialy whn tehy flash acros teh screen forthe bearly a faw frames
. smoe ofthe hte best scenes anbd lines taht cmo tothe mind
.
( qoutes are paraphrased onyl
)

, too
. it reveals m
& m are well onthe theri way tothe expunging all theri distructive tendancies anbd replacing them wtih positve ones
. thsi isnt waht mickey means by
" creater ofthe my universe
,
" he isnt giving hismelf or creating fo hismelf heathy attitudes
. it isnt nto nessasarily a schizophrenic retreat inot solipsism as it firt appears
