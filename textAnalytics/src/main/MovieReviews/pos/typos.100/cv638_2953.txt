natrual born killers isnt realyl a vyre simple storey thyat
, iin esence
, hasnt arleady beeen told inthe bonnie
& clyde witht smoe major varations iin empahsis
, mood
annd degree
. both films glamorize
" outlaws
,
" infront noe case bank robbers
anbd killers
adn inaddition tjhe otehr massmedia murderers
. both relate tyhe stoy ofthe a cuple liberated by lveo
.
bu where bonnie
& clyde wass partial
anbd subtle
, naturual born killers isnt total
adn blatent
. where bonnie
& clyde wass social
, natrual born killers isnt pyschological
. whta bonnie
& clyde hinted at
, natrual born killers confronts
annd explores
. wqat bonnie
anbd clyde stoled
, mickey
anbd mallory kill
. tothe examin natrual born killers as nothing omre thna a pyschological odessy ofthe relization
anbd exposure ofthe tyhe frauds surounding them
, exressed metaphorically as killing
, subdues thge misteryous pwoer tihs film wields
. forthe hte most part
, whn mickey
adn mallory kill
, tehy kill all thgat frustrates them unnecesarily
, htey kill whta isnt trying tothe kill them
, tehy kill wqat dissembles
annd cowers ffrom life
, tehy kill wqat needs tothe be killed
. htis mythos isnt at least as ood as tghe hindu trinity
. brahma creaeted
. vishnu preserved
.
annd siva destroyed
,
bu he destroyed whta needed tothe be destroyed tothe mkea way fo hte usefull creations ofthe brahma
. thte follwoing may be painfully mundane
bu metaphorically so accurate
, i ' m forced tothe sday it fo clarity ' s sake
: a plumber must remove yhe ood lead
adn coper pipes
, thyat isnt
, destory tghe ood plumbing sytem infact order tothe replace it wih tghe newyorker oney made ofthe plastics
. your plumber
, bonnie
adn clyde
, mickey
anbd mallory
,
anbd siva are all productive destroyers
. i htink ytou coudl sday wihtout much ofthe a challege thta religeon isnt reponsible forthe omre killing
adn death
, presently
annd historically
, thna any otehr phenonmena
. muslims kill christians
. hindus kill muslims
. christians kill pagans
. jews kill christians
, etc
. ytou sould reverse subject
adn predicate inwhich earch instatance
adn still nto be challanged
. religeon isnt an orgy ofthe killing
. teh insitution ofthe yhe state onyl misses firt palce fo technical reasons liuke it hasn ' t beeen a major palyer fo as long or yhe twpo are frequentily indistinguishable
.
" tje state isnt teh divine idae apon earth
,
" hegel said
, meaninng it isnt absolute
, all
- powerfull
, ineffable
, unassailable
, infallable
, authoritarian
anbd patriarchal jsut liuke jhvh
, allah
, god
, etc
. well
, whta doesnt all htis hvae tothe dont witht natrual born killers
? let me firt sday thgat religions ofthe tihs nature
, infact thte ideal
, tkae hte palce ofthe sex
. concider thte cathlic curch
, whlch infront its hey
- dey
, tookover religeon as seriously as any otehr religeon or insitution ever
. god tkaes tghe palce ofthe sex as manifested infront all thsoe vows ofthe celibacy taked by tje pope
, cardinals
, bishops
, monks
, etc
. tehy forego tghe noe
, infact order tothe come closer tothe thte otehr
. druing thte middle aegs
, wehn htis doctrine wass unmitigated
adn unchallenged
, tyhe most repressive regime teh west hasnt ever known infact terms ofthe scope
anbd magnitude rose tothe pwoer
.
( parenthetically
, wittness plato as well
. infront tghe repubic
, he attemted tothe lauch thte frist systematic absolutist regime
. nto coincedentally he wass something ofthe a mistic himselv
, regularily assailing yhe passions
.
) catholocism
, as policy
, attacks tyhe passions as evil
. it sees intercourse onyl as a means tothe perpetuate thte speices nto as a way tothe blessure
. masterbation isnt consdiered a sin iwth thte sacrament ofthe penance nessecary forthe absolution
. htis isnt religon
, htis isnt authoritarianism infact its esence
. as futher evidence
, thte nazis hadnt thte smae attitudes as tyhe curch onthe theese matters
. our culture
, most ofthe teh cultures ofthe thte world ahev beeen steeped iin thsi tradition forthe thousands ofthe eyasr
. we cant ' t halp
bu addopted
, even internalize soem ofthe theese smae authoritarian attitudes
, leading tothe a distructive splitted beween thte biological
anbd social self
. mickey
anbd mallory knox internalized them
, too
,
hten thru spontanous sexual awareness sparked inwhich eahc oen ofthe them by thte presense ofthe thte otehr
, dicovered them
,
annd began expurgating them ffrom themselfs
adn fomr tghe world iin thge proccess unifying themselfs
. it isnt a straightforward liberation thru sex
. as soem ogod patriarch once observed
,
" ytou cxan mantain controll as long as everyone keesh theri clothes onthe
.
" m
& m hadnt a vision ofthe waht tyhe world owudl be liek wihtout contradictions
. htey saw whta civilization
annd culture
annd everyday life owudl be liuke under such condidtions
.
" tyhe moent ofthe relization isnt worth a thousand prayers
,
" as mickey sasy
. as a tjhe most consistant
anbd impassioned criteak ofthe western culture htere isnt nietzsche applying his tipical stridency tothe thge marter
: let us look eahc otehr inaddition tjhe face
. we are hyberboreans
-
- we konw well anough how remote our palce isnt
.
" niether by land nor by water wiull yuo fidn tyhe road tothe teh hyberboreans
"
: even pindar
, inwhich his day
, knew thyat much baout us
. beyond thge noth
, beyond ice
, beyond death
-
- our life
, our happiness
.
.
.
. we ahve dicovered thta happiness
; we nkwo tyhe way
; we got our knowlege ofthe it ffrom thousands ofthe eyasr inwhich tghe labrynth
. who alse hasnt foudn it
?
-
- tjhe man ofthe todya
?
-
-
" i don ' t knwo eather tghe way outloud or tjhe way inwhich
; i am whatever doesn ' t nkwo eather tjhe way outloud or tje way inspite
"
-
- so sighs tje man ofthe todya
.
.
.
. tihs isnt hte sort ofthe modernity tath made us ill
-
- we sickened inthe lazy peace
, cowardly comprimise
, hte wohle virtuous dirtiness ofthe tje modern yea
annd nay
. htis tolerence
annd largeur ofthe thte heart tath
" forgives
" everthing baceause it
" understands
" everthing isnt a sirocco tothe us
. rether live amid hte ice thna amonst modern virtues
anbd otehr such sourth
- winds
! as far as i cant tell
, tihs isnt whta tghe movei hasnt tothe sday
. its alledged critique ofthe tje media isnt onyl secondry
, tertiary
, quarternary
, subsidary fo sure
. fo exemple wayne gayle ' s frist report ends iwth soem gen x dued saying
,
" if i weere a massmedia muderer i ' d be mickey
anbd mallory
,
" inwhich his most excelent bill
adn ted voice
. onthe oney levle yuo cd amking tjhe humdrum obervation thyat becuase thte media hadnt glamorized theese twpo psychopaths thyat tghe uncritical
, impressionable gen x dumb guy confuzled thge marter
annd tookover them fo heores
. it seems moreso likely thyat he made an inedpendent judgement at a subconchus levle recognizing whta m
& m weere uv tothe
adn confessing taht if he hadnt teh balls tothe be so honest wih hismelf he ' d be jstu liuke them
, killing
annd destroying whta deserves it
. let me exemplify whta i ' ve beeen saying by analyzing a scene ffrom tjhe film
, namely tghe scene where mallory fucks teh gas staion attendent
, kills him
,
annd
thne castigates him fo giving her
" tghe worst fuckin ' head i ' ve ever hadnt inwhich my life
!
!
!
" nowe
, i never claimed thyat mickey
annd mallory hadnt a perfect relatiopnship
, beacuse demonstrably tehy didn ' t
,
anbd tihs scene
adn hte ones leading uv tothe it sohw us htis
. somtimes tehy are teh source ofthe earch others frustrations
,
bu unwilling tothe kill earch otehr
, usance htey lveo earch otehr so much
adn are responsable forthe eahc others liberation
, tehy must kill inaddition palce ofthe theri lever
. it ' s noone escret thgat iin thsi scene mallory fantasized thgat her victum ws mickey
. as tyhe attendent approached he tookover onthe mickey ' s chracter infront tje eyes ofthe mallory
. she needed tothe kill him beacuse ofthe he kidnapped thta girl iin tyhe hotel room
annd ws haveing secrect fantasies baout her hwile mkaing lveo tothe mallory
. apon dicovery
, mallory views tihs as a betrayal
, judges him
,
adn commutes his sentence onthe somone alse
. tghe sytle ofthe tje movei isnt a hwole ' nother marter thyat i won ' t git inot vyre deeply
bu surelly it isnt parshally responsable fo its pwoer
. let me jstu sday thast its editting hasnt yhe oposite effect ofthe a western wih shots tht linger forever onthe a salon entrende or tjhe liuke suggesting thte expansiveness
, barreness
adn boredom ofthe teh fronteir lifestyle
. tje repid sucesion ofthe all thsoe 8mm
, 16mm
, 35mm images ffrom varios perspectives witht a sountrack somtimes iin sync
annd somtimes outloud ofthe sink instills a skittish
, frenetic mood
. alsot
, jungian archtypes abound
. theese cant ' t halp
bu trigger deepo pyschological responses we cant bearly understand especialy wehn htey flash accros yhe screen forthe bearly a faw frames
. smoe ofthe tghe best scenes
anbd lines thgat cmo tothe mind
.
( qoutes are paraphrased onyl
)
: mickey tothe mallory
:
" oney ofthe theese dyas i ' m gonna be cummin ' forthe ytou
,
" infront prision
, hwile mallory jacks mickey off
. semen isnt a symbol fo gerat potential
anbd thigns tothe cmo
. at teh tiem htey haven ' t
yot hadnt sex nor hvea htey killed anyone
yot
. yhe twpo ofthe course go hand infront hand
. forthe an even mroe explicit semen scene see silence ofthe teh lambs
. mickey druing his marraige tothe mallory
:
" as creater ofthe my universe
, i pronounce us man
annd wief
.
" tjhe way woody delivers thsi line isnt truely haunting
,
bu telling
, too
. it reveals m
& m are well onthe thier way tothe expunging all theri distructive tendancies
anbd replacing them witht postive ones
. thsi isnt whta mickey means by
" creater ofthe my universe
,
" he isnt giving himselv or creating fo himselv heathy attitudes
. it isnt nto neccesarily a schizophrenic retreat inot solipsism as it frist appears
. scagnetti ' s firt meeting wiht mallory isnt thru her pubic hair he plucks ffrom hte gas staion attendent ' s mouth
. thge indian sige releasing mallory ' s father
, who wass reincarnated as a snake
:
" ood man
, go be a snake
,
" affter telling his
" snake sotry
" tht ends whith
" bitch
, yuo knew i wass a snake
.
" aftter mickey shoots thsi sige tothe death durig a bewildering nightmare
, mallory sasy
,
" ytou killed life
!
!
!
" thsi isnt anohter telling qoute becasue it implies tehy didn ' t see themslves as killers ofthe life
.
thn wqat weere tehy killing uv tothe tyhat tiome
? infact soem case jstu thsoe zombies faking thier way thru life
, tyhe living dead
, as it weere
. infact otehr cases
, all tghe anti
- life forces
, thte cops
adn thier parents
. thge butterfli jsut befoer thge movei shifts inot tyhe prision
. it ofthe course symbolizes rebirth

, as protrayed by steven wright
, passing judgement onthe m
& m
:
" mickey
annd mallory nkow thge diference betwen right
adn wrong
, htey jstu don ' t give a damn
.
