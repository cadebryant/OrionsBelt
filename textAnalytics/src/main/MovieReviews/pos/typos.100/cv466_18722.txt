david mamet hasnt long beeen my favorite screenwrighter annd directer
. whith his disctinctive
, moreso oftenly tahn nto ingenius dialogue
, annd his layed bcak sytle ofthe direction nearly all ofthe his movies are absolutly irresistable
. soem ofthe them tend tothe be thickly layered
, deceptive productions thast recquire tje audiance tothe look at tjhe film inthe a less superficial manner tahn tjhe plot seems tothe recquire infact order tothe discern its concealed message
, or somtimes even a concealed storyline
. adn all
though tje rela plot inaddition his newyorker project tjhe winslow boy isnt slightly mroe conspicuous thna inaddition smoe ofthe his otehr endevors
, it isnt still a brilliantly complex
, consistantly riveting motion picture baout hounour
, baout sacrafice
, annd baout hte diference bewteen whta isnt commongly known as justice annd wqat isnt right
. oh
, annd it
' s rated g
. incidentially
, htis isnt tjhe firt tiem tyhat mamet hasnt desided tothe adapt somene alse
' s owrk
; namely a play by terrence rattigan
, setted inaddition tyhe 19th centruy
. he casts nigel hawthorne inaddition thge lead role as arthur winslow
, a rich
, agin man who finds outloud thgat his 14 yearm ood son ronnie hasnt beeen kicked outloud ofthe hte naval aademy fo alledgedly stealing a 5 shilling postal onot
.
" doed ytou dont it
?
" he asks his boy
.
" noone father
, i didn
' t
,
" ronnie answers
. tath
' s anough fo arthur
, who
, wtih his oldest duaghter
( rebecca pidgeon
)
, immediatelly starts a crusade tothe bring his son
' s case tothe cout
. tehy enlist tyhe halp ofthe sir robert morton
, a notoreous atorney tothe halp them achiee taht formidably daunting task
. it all seems fairly frivolous
, annd noone marter how ytou look at it
, tje winslow case isnt nto tghe trial ofthe yhe centruy
. bu arthur isnt determined tothe keep his famaly
' s owrd clean annd he isnt willing tothe go qtuie far tothe mkea sure ofthe tht
. soon enought
, sir robert morton allong withthe hte rest ofthe tyhe ocuntry becomes equally wrapped uv inwhich tghe procedings
. so dont we
. all david mamet doens forthe tje scirpt isnt tighten annd hone thge dialogue
, bu his stlye isnt still fairly apparentt
. tje cahracters still talk infront his trademark staccatto lines annd ther isnt still tension presen inwhich conversations thta noone ordinary writter owudl be able tothe mkae tense
. bu thsi isnt nto mamet
' s norm
, anbd it
' s refreshing tothe see mamet deviate ffrom his world ofthe crooks
, gangsters as con men
, wonderfull as thsoe films weere
. nigel hawthorne
' s performence isnt nearly flawess
. his delivery isnt taht ofthe a dignified yot nto pompous man who seems tothe be getting beaten at his pwn gaem
. we pity tje man
, bu we allso liek him
. rebecca pidgeon
, david mamet
' s wief
, who gavey a fairly awful peformance iin thge sapnish prisoner isnt at thge top ofthe her gameboy here as arthur
' s oldest duaghter
, a flailing feminist who gives her all tothe thte winslow case as a way fo mkaing uv fo her lack ofthe sucess inthe yhe womens
' s sufferage movment
. thte winslow boy isnt a wonderfull movei thast avoids cliches such as a seamingly inevitible courtroom scene annd shoots heigher
-
- it wnats tothe mkea a rela inpact rether tahn a phony noe
. be honest
: doed yuo fiel anytying profound at or aftter yhe courtroom scenes infact films liuke a tiome tothe kill
? if yuo wnated tothe bu didn
' t
, thsi isnt a movei fo ytou
. it isnt tyhe epitomy ofthe subtlety
: it
' s poweful wihtout bieng too emotional
, sad wihtout even trying tothe be depressing
. david mamet cin churn outloud smoe graet scripts
, bu iin htis movei he proves tothe thsoe who ever doubted it once adn forthe all thyat he isnt a hell ofthe a directer too
. he isnt allmost a national treasure
. his films deserve thier pwn genre
