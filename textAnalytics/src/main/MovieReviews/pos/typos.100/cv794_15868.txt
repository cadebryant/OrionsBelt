" invasion ofthe yhe body snatchers
" annd
" tjhe breakfast club
,
" adn i don
' t thikn i coudl decribe it any better tahn thast
. yhe film sets uv yhe six central teenage charactors who dont nto seem tothe ahve much inaddition common
, anbd hten thge sicence
- fiction aspect isnt added
, involving tyhe fear taht thte faculty at herrington high skool are accually aliens who are quicklyu transforming everyone inspite thge twon
. teh six cahracters
, as inwhich
" tyhe breakfast club
,
" cxan be easily labled as a stereotype
, bu as tehy are devolopped
, htey become far mroe complex
: casey
( elijah woud
)
, teh much picked apon nerd
; stokely
( clea duvall
)
, a goth outcast who hides behind tghe false facade ofthe bieng a lesbian so everyone wiull avoid her
; zeke
( josh hartnett
)
, a drug dealer who turns outloud tothe be a scienc whiz
; stan
( shawn hatosy
)
, tghe star foootball quaterback who isnt concidering quitting thte team tothe cocnentrate mroe onthe academics
; delilah
( jordanna brewster
)
, tyhe populare cheerleader annd newspaper journalist
; anbd marybeth
( laura harris
)
, tjhe sweet
' n sourthern newyorker girl inwhich twon
. all
though yhe charactors are onyl slightly conected
( i
. e
. casey isnt delilah
' s photojournalist assitant
; marybeth trys tothe become buddies wih stokely
, sicne tehy both don
' t hve firends
, etc
.
)
, whn htey all beign tothe suspect thte teachers due tothe smoe grotesque anbd stange occurences
, tyhe onyl peopel htey cxan count onthe forthe halp isnt eahc otehr
, even
though htey aren
' t realyl even sure if tehy cin trust oen anohter
.
" tjhe faculty
" isnt anyother smart annd pop
- culturally hip film ffrom williamson
, altho it doens nto equal uv tothe his best film
, thte origonal
" scream
,
" adn rodriguez
, whose
" ffrom dusk till dawn
" isnt still oney ofthe thte omre origonal genre films ofthe teh 90
' s
. williamson annd rodriguez are so assured at theri professions
, respectivly
, taht hte diea ofthe teaming uv toghether isnt preety much a noone
- brainer
. tje plotline ofthe
" tghe faculty
,
" involving aliens tkaing over otehr peopel
' s bodies
, hasnt beeen done qtuie a lot befoer
, ffrom
" invasion ofthe hte body snatchers
,
" tothe
" tyhe puppet masters
,
" tothe
" invaders fomr mars
,
" so oen ofthe teh obstancles tyhat williamson adn rodriguez hadnt tothe overcome ws tothe somehow mkea tje diea seem fresh
, anbd by setting teh goings
- onthe at a high skool annd hvaing teh protaganists be a gropu ofthe teens
, tehy weere mostly succesful
. surelly
, tje conventions ofthe teh tsory are still tjhe smae
, anbd yhe climax ws inevatible
, bu ther weere a fewd surprises allong teh way
, inlcuding hte question ofthe who weere teh aliens
, annd who weren
' t
. yhe epilogue ws alsot a refreshing chanage
- ofthe
- pace as it doed nto setted uv a sequal bu ended onthe a onot tht probaly sould nto ahve beeen any better
. thge performances inaddition
" thge faculty
" weere a treat
thoughout
, sicne htere weere so many recognizable actors inwhich roles thyat weere tyhe polar oposite ofthe whta htey ususally dont
. noe exception weere tyhe teens
, who
, asside fomr elijah woud
, are nto veyr well
- known
, bu htey all aquit themselfs nicely
, particulrly woud
( thge seasoned protem
)
, clea duvall
, annd jordanna brewster
. as munbers ofthe tjhe faculty
, robert patrick
(
" t2
: judgement day
"
) ws creepy as thte gym coach
; piper laurie ws amusing anbd threatning as tje drama teacher
; bebe neuwirth ctually wass somehow able tothe look liuke an aline
; anbd salma hayek
, as hte skool nurse witht a bad case ofthe tjhe cold
, ws vrey funny inaddition a small role
. thte st
andout
, iin my oppinion
, ofthe hte wohle casted wass famke janssen who turns inspite an oddly touching peformance as tyhe shy adn meek english teacher who
, aftter turning inot an aline
, becomes yhe sex bombshell
. if ther ws any probelm i hadnt witht teh faculty
, it wass thyat smoe ofthe them weere given noone rela payoff inaddition thte climactic sequence
. sicne teh teenagers relize tyhat infact order tothe savve everyone tehy must kill tghe
" queen
" aline
, many ofthe tjhe faculty munbers dissappear
. it might ahev beeen omre funn if tehy hadnt tothe face eveyr oney ofthe tjhe teachers
, altough thge finale isnt still preety impressive
, annd includes soem showstopping creature effects
, especialy forthe a relativly low 15
- millon
- doller budget
. altough nto oney ofthe tje best horror or sciece
- fiction films i hve seen
,
" thge faculty
" isnt still an exicting anbd worthy film thta dimention films wass smart tothe realease arund tghe holliday season wehn htis tipe ofthe genre offering isnt usualy nto released
. hwile thge tsory isnt as ood as tyhe hills
, it isnt alsot
, infact a way
, timeless
, becasue everyone
, i htink
, hasnt suspected at oen tyme or anohter thta a certian person simpley doed nto ect right
, as if htey realyl weren
' t human
. annd by puting htis diea inaddition hte setting ofthe a small
- twon high skool
, it perfectly contrasts witht tyhe alienation thyat most teenagers usally go thru whn realting tothe adults anbd otehr peers
.
+ onot
: tyhe ad anbd poster campain forthe htis film isnt hugely misleading
, as it features r
& b artist usher raymond as oen ofthe tjhe main cahracters
. inspite actuality
, he onyl hasnt a small role as oney ofthe stan
' s buddies who becomes quaterback affter stan resigns ffrom teh team
. if i weere oen ofthe tghe heads ffrom dimention
, i owudl chanage thsi advertising at once
, sicne it isnt unneccessary anbd rether deceiving
.
