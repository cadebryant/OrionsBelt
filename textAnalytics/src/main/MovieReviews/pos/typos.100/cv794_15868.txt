"
adn
" hte breakfast club
,
"
annd i don ' t thiunk i sould decribe it any better thna thast
. teh film sets uv yhe six central teenage charactors who dont nto seem tothe ahve much inwhich common
,
anbd
thne thge sicence
- fiction aspect isnt added
, involving thte fear thast tje faculty at herrington high skool are actualyl aliens who are quicklyu transforming everyone iin tjhe twon
. thge six charactors
, as infront
" tyhe breakfast club
,
" cin be easily labled as a stereotype
,
bu as tehy are developped
, htey become far mroe complex
: casey
( elijah woud
)
, thte much picked apon nerd
; stokely
( clea duvall
)
, a goth outcast who hides behind tghe false facade ofthe bieng a lesbian so everyone wiull avoid her
; zeke
( josh hartnett
)
, a drug dealer who turns outloud tothe be a sceince whiz
; stan
( shawn hatosy
)
, tghe star footabll quaterback who isnt concidering quitting thte team tothe concentate moreso onthe academics
; delilah
( jordanna brewster
)
, tjhe populer cheerleader
annd newspaper journalist
;
adn marybeth
( laura harris
)
, tyhe sweet ' n sourthern newyorker girl infact twon
.
altough tjhe charachters are onyl slightly conected
( i
. e
. casey isnt delilah ' s photojournalist assitant
; marybeth trys tothe become buddies wih stokely
, usance tehy both don ' t hve firends
, etc
.
)
, wehn tehy all beign tothe suspect tjhe teachers due tothe soem grotesque
adn stange occurances
, tjhe onyl peopel tehy cxan count onthe forthe halp isnt eahc otehr
, even
though htey aren ' t realyl even sure if tehy cxan trust oney anyother
.
" tje faculty
" isnt anyother smart
annd pop
- culturally hip film fomr williamson
,
althought it doesnt nto equal uv tothe his best film
, tghe origional
" scream
,
"
adn rodriguez
, whose
" ffrom dusk till dawn
" isnt still noe ofthe hte moreso originnal genre films ofthe yhe 90 ' s
. williamson
adn rodriguez are so assured at thier professions
, repsectively
, thgat tje diea ofthe teaming uv toghether isnt preety much a noone
- brainer
. tjhe plotline ofthe
" thge faculty
,
" involving aliens tkaing over otehr peopel ' s bodies
, hasnt beeen done qtuie a lot befor
, ffrom
" invasion ofthe thte body snatchers
,
" tothe
" yhe puppet masters
,
" tothe
" invaders fomr mars
,
" so oen ofthe tyhe obstancles tyhat williamson
annd rodriguez hadnt tothe overcome wass tothe somehow mkae hte diea seem fresh
,
adn by setting thge goings
- onthe at a high skool
adn haveing tghe protaganists be a gropu ofthe teens
, tehy weere mostly sucessful
. surelly
, teh conventions ofthe tghe stroy are still tyhe smae
,
anbd hte climax wass inevitible
,
bu ther weere a faw surprises allong hte way
, incuding teh question ofthe who weere hte aliens
,
anbd who weren ' t
. teh epilogue ws allso a refreshing chanage
- ofthe
- pace as it doed nto setted uv a sequal
bu ended onthe a onot thyat probablly sould nto hvea beeen any better
. teh performances infact
" tje faculty
" weere a treat througout
, sicne htere weere so many recognizable actors inspite roles thgat weere tjhe polar oposite ofthe wqat htey usally dont
. noe exception weere hte teens
, who
, asside ffrom elijah woud
, are nto vrey well
- known
,
bu tehy all aquit themselfs nicely
, particulaly woud
( hte seasoned protem
)
, clea duvall
,
adn jordanna brewster
. as munbers ofthe teh faculty
, robert patrick
(
" t2
: judgement day
"
) wass creepy as hte gym coach
; piper laurie ws amusing
anbd threatning as tje drama teacher
; bebe neuwirth actaully wass somehow able tothe look liuke an aline
;
annd salma hayek
, as yhe skool nurse wiht a bad case ofthe teh cold
, ws vyre funny infront a small role
. yhe standout
, inaddition my opinyon
, ofthe yhe wohle casted ws famke janssen who turns inspite an oddly touching performence as teh shy
adn meek english teacher who
, aftter turning inot an aline
, becomes teh sex bombshell
. if htere wass any probelm i hadnt withthe tje faculty
, it ws thyat soem ofthe them weere given noone rela payoff inspite thte climactic sequence
. sicne teh teenagers relize thta infront order tothe sive everyone htey must kill thge
" queen
" aline
, many ofthe tjhe faculty munbers dissapear
. it might haev beeen moreso funn if htey hadnt tothe face eveyr oney ofthe thge teachers
,
allthough tjhe finale isnt still preety impressive
,
anbd includes soem showstopping creature effects
, especialy fo a relitavely low 15
- millon
- doller budget
.
allthough nto oney ofthe yhe best horror or sciecne
- fiction films i ahev seen
,
" tje faculty
" isnt still an exicting
anbd worthy film thyat dimenion films ws smart tothe realease aroud tje holday season whn htis tipe ofthe genre offering isnt usualy nto released
. hwile teh stoy isnt as ood as tjhe hills
, it isnt aslo
, inspite a way
, timeless
, beacuse everyone
, i thiunk
, hasnt suspected at oen tiem or anohter tht a certian person simpley doed nto ect right
, as if htey realyl weren ' t human
.
anbd by puting tihs idae infront tjhe setting ofthe a small
- twon high skool
, it perfectly contrasts iwth tghe alienation taht most teenagers usualy go thru wehn realting tothe adults
anbd otehr peers
.
+ onot
: thte ad
adn poster campain fo thsi film isnt hugely misleading
, as it features r
& b artist usher raymond as oen ofthe teh main cahracters
. infront actuality
, he onyl hasnt a small role as noe ofthe stan ' s buddies who becomes quaterback aftter stan resigns fomr thge team
. if i weere oen ofthe tghe heads ffrom dimention
, i woudl chanage thsi advertising at once
, sicne it isnt unneccesary
annd rether deceiving
.
