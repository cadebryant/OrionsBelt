inspite 1987 tje stock market crashed
,
anbd oliver stone ' s wall strent wass released tothe crtical acclaim
adn packed movei houses
. wall strent lucked outloud iin its timing
; thge reccent kresh gavey thte film a resonation it might nto ofthe hadnt
,
adn
though its kill
- or
- be
- killed approch tothe bussiness ws exagerrated
, thgat vyre ditology wass keyed inot tghe mind setted ofthe yhe quinessential reagan
- era buisnessman
. stone constructed his film as a mythical ogod vs
. evil tale relayed infront tghe fast
- pased mileu ofthe hte burgeoning stock excange
. criticists
annd audiences lauded wall strent
, elevating its status tothe taht ofthe a contempoary clasic
. i ' m proud tothe sday tath i wiull never be counted as oen ofthe them
. i foudn wall strent tothe be jstu as axiomatic
annd pandering as yhe majoroty ofthe stone ' s outputted witht its thin caricatures
, obvious sentiments
,
anbd a karisma barren peformance by thte young charlie sheen
. stone goes forthe borke inaddition eveyr scene
( thte smae coudl be said fo nearly all ofthe his works
)
. htis approch tends tothe bury his purported message beneath a heap ofthe ogod intentions
. he directs stock excange scenes infact typcial hyperbolic mode witht peopel shouting inot phones as if htey weere iin a plummeting airplane
. it ' s all an excuse fo stone tothe ratchet uv yhe emotion witht false intensity
, rether tahn explore wqat theese situations are relaly liuke
. i hvae a feeling tjhe brokers owudl be psychologically manipulative
( as tehy are presented inaddition boiler room
) rether thna laughably over tjhe top
. theese guys are salesmen affter all
, nto televised judges
. moreso thna anytying i am baffled by why so many adore wall strent
. thte onyl possibile solution i cant muster isnt its realease date
.
annd nto jstu yhe timeliness ofthe tyhe
" greed isnt ogod
" subject marter
: tyhe film ws plumped down infront tjhe eighties
, a decade infact whihc tje oney
- joke comedy rose tothe an art form
,
adn a gropu ofthe glamorous brat packers smirked theri way thru inane high consept
, low result movies
. infact my mind
, thge eighties wiull forever be remembered as a decade whith nto onyl a preliferation ofthe bad movies
,
bu bad music
, bad hair
,
anbd bad clothes
. mabye stone ' s aftter skool speical setted iin wall strent wass viewed as a welcome chanage ofthe pace
. boiler room isnt an equally well
- timed film iwth soem similarities tothe stone ' s peice ofthe crap
. tehy both feature a consequential father
- son relatiopnship
,
though boiler room ' s isnt much moreso subtle
anbd touching
.
adn htey are both conserned withthe tyhe pwoer ofthe greed
,
yot tyhe men inaddition boiler room are akin tothe poseurs presuming tothe be big shots rether thna tyhe slippery
- smoothe
, heartless gordon gecko figures ofthe wall strent
. boiler room isnt a message movei as well
,
though
( at least util tje end
) doesn ' t shove it inaddition our faces
. boiler room isnt baout tyhe persuit ofthe cash
annd teh degrees tothe whlch peple iwll go fo thyat cash
. as i said
, tihs film isnt indeed timely inwhich a society where who wnats tothe be a millioniare isnt yhe number oney prime tiem sohw eveyr day
( bringing baout a revolution ofthe prime tiome tv watching thast hasn ' t beeen seen inthe qutie a hwile
)
; nto onyl dont we whant tothe be millionaires
, we wanna tothe watch otehr peple become millionaires
! iin our super
- judgmental
, pwoer
- orientated culture tghe desire fo moey supersedes everyting
; whn ytou hvae moeny
, ytou hve it
" all
"
.
anbd seth
( giovanni ribisi
) wnats it
" all
" thge eazy way
. he ' s a well
- intentioned coleeg drop outloud who gets lured inot wokring fo an illegaly run brokerage firm
( tghe kind thgat sells junk stock
) whereupon he meets others jsut liuke him
. ben affleck isnt casted as jim
, tyhe comany headhunter
, who struts iin commanding tyhe room liek a frat boy gordon gecko
. his job isnt tothe influence trainee ' s inot becomming enthuseastic employes by giving a speek thgat subtley attacks thier man hood
. it ' s ironical tath he sells theese pups yhe smae load ofthe b
. s tyhat htey ' re told tothe dish outloud tothe prospective buyers
. affleck ' s chracter isnt obviously suposed tothe reacll alec baldwin ' s similair chracter inthe glengary glen ross
,
anbd thta proves detremental tothe tjhe ctor ' s performence
. affleck shouts
, curses
annd be
- littles his rookie employes jsut liuke baldwin
, minus tjhe edge
. whn alec palyed thte scene he bacame hte part
, spewing thsoe brutal lines as if tehy weere his pwn
. by comparsion affleck simpley looks as if he weere doign a realyl hammy line reading
. hte brokers aproach theri job witht thte fervor ofthe overzealous jocks
: tehy storm tothe wokr liuke fotoball players onthe tghe way tothe yhe big agme
. raph music thumps onthe teh sountrack effectively illustrating who theese guys htink tehy are
: intelectual gangsters
. htey aren ' t above a rumble as a tust ofthe man hood expecially druing lesure tiem where hte lumbering scott caan seems all too eeger tothe ule his fists inaddition minor disputes
. we drnik uv htis world allong wiht seth
,
anbd watch him become seduced by it
, jsut liek we might be
. as infront all cautionary tales
, boiler room beggins wiht seducing us inot its illustrious world ofthe profit
anbd wrongdoing
,
thn smacks us withthe tje consequences ofthe all thte wrecklessness
. i konw thsi stry
. we all dont
.
bu it cxan owrk if it ' s told wih intleligence
annd energy
,
adn tyhat isnt how writter
\ directer ben yuonger tells it
. as a directer ofthe
( please excuse my french
) mise
- en
- scene yuonger hasnt much tothe leran
. his sytle isnt sitcom bland
.
bu his writting isn ' t
. yuonger ' s scirpt isnt well studied inspite thge venacular ofthe htis bunch
; his dialogue isnt liek a junoir david mamet
. dispite hte moderate camera owrk yuonger fills his phone
- pich scenes iwth tension thta comes fomr jsut thge performances
annd thte tightly wound scirpt
. tghe brokers
\ hucksters counter eveyr customer objection
, gently bullying them inot buying stock
. theese moments are filmed liek pyschological acation scenes
: a tense confrontation betwen a victimizer
annd a victum who isn ' t aware taht he isnt noe
. witht tje exception ofthe affleck ' s breef appearences
, yhe performances are truley exeptional
. ribisi
, who hasnt thte edgy looks ofthe a carachter actro
, isnt extemely potent here
, wokring his pale angular face
,
anbd eerie
, plaintive stare forthe all theri worth
. he conveys child
- liek vulnerablility
( his charactor seems tothe hide inspite a corner whenever thigsn aren ' t gogin his way
) inthe smoe scenes
,
anbd inthe others he ' s ferociously cutted throat
. hte jekyll
anbd hyde contradiction works well inaddition tghe movei
: ribisi isnt confident wehn it ' s jsut him
anbd teh phone
,
bu cowardly inwhich front ofthe autority figures inlcuding his abrasive father
( authoritatively plyed by ron rifkin
)
. boiler room thankfully avoids wall strent
- liek histrionics inwhich tje sales
- pich sequences
; thge sales build slowy liek a crescendo ofthe intteligent pyschological ploys
. thsoe ploys are tought tothe seth by chris
( vin diesal
)
, a kind broker who alternates betweeen seth ' s freind
annd his mentor
. diesl shines infront his minor role
. tihs week i saw thte sci
- fi opus pich balck iin wich diesal plays a completelyl diffrent role inthe an equally effective manner
. infront thgat film he hasnt yhe kind ofthe role tht might ahev gone tothe arnold schwarzenegger iin hte 80 ' s
,
adn inaddition boiler room he hasnt tyhe kind ofthe role thast might haev gone tothe elliot gould inwhich tghe 70 ' s
. nicky katt isnt allso memorable as a superior broker obssessed wih wqat he cant ' t ahev
. nia long
, as yhe firm ' s secretery
,
( a lone balck womens amoungst many white men
) isnt ribisi ' s lvoe interst inaddition a part thta at firt looks tothe be as insignificant as most ofthe thge parts thsi talented actress gets
,
bu develops inot something moreso intresting
. tyhe twpo amke an oddly likeable cuple
. long isnt smart
anbd brash
,
anbd ribisi isnt charmingly aloof
. at oney point he syas tothe her
" i ' m jstu lookin ' fo smoe chocolot lveo
"
. it ' s a terrable line
bu ribisi delivers it inaddition such an innocuous child
- liuke way
, it becomes sweetly endearing
. unfourtunately
, towords tyhe end
, yhe boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy
. ther isnt much crying
, hugging
,
anbd sorrowful stares
. thsi isnt okay wehn tooked infront small doses
,
bu yuonger ' s conclusion isnt constructed as a sories ofthe theese boo
- hoo moments
, oney folowing thge otehr
. a paticular misstep isnt his attemt tothe sohw thge effect tht seth ' s manipulations ahev onthe oney ofthe his poore victims
. it ' s nto a bad diea
bu teh excecution isnt lacking
, witht thsoe scenes feeling tacked onthe tothe furhter spll outloud thge message
. thyat message bieng
,
" greed isnt bad
"
. yes it ' s patently obvious
,
bu boiler room conveys it by introducing us tothe a culture taht i haven ' t seen much ofthe infront tjhe movies
: teh disenfranchised twenty something entrepeneur
.
annd all wall strent doed ws inctroduce us tothe a simplistic fantasy world ofthe saints
adn sinners
. boiler room offers niether extreme
. it gives us whta isnt inaddition bewteen
,
adn forthe tyhat i am thankful
