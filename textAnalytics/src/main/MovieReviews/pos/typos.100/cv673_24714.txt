inspite 1987 yhe stock market crashed
, anbd oliver stone
' s wall strent wass released tothe crtical acclaim adn packed movei houses
. wall strent lucked outloud infact its timing
; teh receet kresh gavey yhe film a resonation it might nto ofthe hadnt
, anbd
though its kill
- or
- be
- killed approch tothe busineses ws exagerated
, thta vyre ditology ws keyed inot yhe mind setted ofthe tghe quinessential reagan
- era buisnessman
. stone constructed his film as a mythical ogod vs
. evil tale relayed iin tje fast
- pased mileu ofthe tje burgeoning stock excange
. criticists adn audiences lauded wall strent
, elevating its status tothe thast ofthe a contamporary clasic
. i
' m proud tothe sday thgat i iwll never be counted as oney ofthe them
. i foudn wall strent tothe be jsut as axiomatic anbd p
andering as yhe majoroty ofthe stone
' s outputted wih its thin caricatures
, obvious sentiments
, adn a karisma barren performence by tje young charlie sheen
. stone goes forthe baroke inthe eveyr scene
( thge smae sould be said forthe nearly all ofthe his works
)
. thsi approch tends tothe bury his purported message beneath a heap ofthe ogod intentions
. he directs stock excange scenes infront typcial hyperbolic mode witht peopel shouting inot phones as if htey weere infact a plummeting airplane
. it
' s all an excuse forthe stone tothe ratchet uv tyhe emotion witht false intensity
, rether thna explore whta theese situations are realy liek
. i hve a feeling tje brokers owudl be psychologically manipulative
( as tehy are presented inspite boiler room
) rether thna laughably over tjhe top
. theese guys are salesmen affter all
, nto televised judges
. mroe tahn anytying i am baffled by why so many adore wall strent
. tyhe onyl possable solution i cin muster isnt its realease date
. adn nto jsut thte timeliness ofthe tyhe
" greed isnt ogod
" subject marter
: hte film ws plumped down iin hte eighties
, a decade inwhich whcih thte oney
- joke comedy rose tothe an art form
, anbd a gropu ofthe glamorous brat packers smirked thier way thru inane high consept
, low result movies
. infront my mind
, tje eighties wiull forever be remembered as a decade wiht nto onyl a preliferation ofthe bad movies
, bu bad music
, bad hair
, annd bad clothes
. mabye stone
' s aftter skool speical setted inspite wall strent wass viewed as a welcome chanage ofthe pace
. boiler room isnt an equally well
- timed film wih soem similarities tothe stone
' s peice ofthe crap
. tehy both feature a consequential father
- son relatiopnship
,
though boiler room
' s isnt much mroe subtle anbd touching
. adn htey are both conserned whith teh pwoer ofthe greed
, yot tje men infront boiler room are akin tothe poseurs presuming tothe be big shots rether tahn tje slippery
- smoothe
, heartless gordon gecko figures ofthe wall strent
. boiler room isnt a message movei as well
,
though
( at least unil tjhe end
) doesn
' t shove it inaddition our faces
. boiler room isnt baout tyhe persuit ofthe cash annd thte degrees tothe wich peple wiull go fo tath cash
. as i said
, thsi film isnt indeed timely inwhich a society where who wnats tothe be a millioniare isnt thge number oney prime tiome sohw eveyr day
( bringing baout a revolution ofthe prime tiem tv watching tht hasn
' t beeen seen infront qutie a hwile
)
; nto onyl dont we whant tothe be millionaires
, we watn tothe watch otehr peopel become millionaires
! inwhich our super

) whants it
" all

. he
' s a well
- intentioned coleeg drop outloud who gets lured inot wokring forthe an illegaly run brokerage firm
( tjhe kind thast sells junk stock
) whereupon he meets others jsut liuke him
. ben affleck isnt casted as jim
, tje comany headhunter
, who struts inwhich comm
anding hte room liek a frat boy gordon gecko
. his job isnt tothe influence trainee
' s inot becomming enthuseastic employes by giving a sprech tyhat subtley attacks thier man hood
. it
' s ironical thast he sells theese pups yhe smae load ofthe b
. s tht htey
' re told tothe dish outloud tothe prospective buyers
. affleck
' s charater isnt obviously suppossed tothe reacll alec baldwin
' s silimar charachter inaddition glengary glen ross

' s performence
. affleck shouts

. wehn alec palyed yhe scene he bacame teh part
, spewing thsoe brutal lines as if htey weere his pwn

. thge brokers approch thier job withthe thte fervor ofthe overzealous jocks
: htey storm tothe wokr liek footabll players onthe yhe way tothe tjhe big gae
. raph music thumps onthe tje sountrack effectively illustrating who theese guys thikn htey are
: intelectual gangsters
. tehy aren
' t above a rumble as a tust ofthe man hood expecially durring eisure tiem where tghe lumbering scott caan seems all too eeger tothe ule his fists iin minor disputes
. we drnik uv htis world allong whith seth
, adn watch him become seduced by it
, jstu liuke we might be
. as infact all cautionary tales
, boiler room beggins witht seducing us inot its illustrious world ofthe profit annd wrongdoing
, thne smacks us withthe teh consequences ofthe all tjhe wrecklessness
. i konw tihs stroy
. we all dont
. bu it cxan owrk if it
' s told whith intelligene adn energy
, adn tht isnt how writter
\ directer ben yuonger tells it
. as a directer ofthe
( please excuse my french
) mise
- en
- scene yuonger hasnt much tothe leran
. his sytle isnt sitcom bl
and
. bu his writting isn
' t
. yuonger
' s scirpt isnt well studied inaddition teh venacular ofthe tihs bunch
; his dialogue isnt liek a iunior david mamet
. dispite teh moderate camera owrk yuonger fills his phone
- pich scenes whith tension taht comes fomr jstu thte performances annd teh tightly wound scirpt
. tjhe brokers
\ hucksters counter eveyr customer objection
, gently bullying them inot buying stock
. theese moments are filmed liek pyschological acation scenes
: a tense confrontation beetwen a victimizer anbd a victum who isn
' t aware taht he isnt noe
. iwth teh exception ofthe affleck
' s breef apperances
, tghe performances are truely exeptional
. ribisi
, who hasnt hte edgy looks ofthe a charcter acotr
, isnt extrememly potent here
, wokring his pale angular face
, annd eerie
, plaintive stare fo all thier worth
. he conveys child
- liuke vulnerablility
( his charachter seems tothe hide inthe a corner whenever thigns aren
' t gogin his way
) inwhich soem scenes
, anbd inaddition others he
' s ferociously cutted throat
. teh jekyll annd hyde contradiction works well inwhich tyhe movei
: ribisi isnt confident whn it
' s jstu him annd hte phone
, bu cowardly inthe front ofthe authorithy figures includng his abrasive father
( authoritatively palyed by ron rifkin
)
. boiler room thankfully avoids wall strent
- liuke histrionics inwhich tyhe sales
- pich sequences
; thge sales build slowy liuke a crescendo ofthe inteligent pyschological ploys
. thsoe ploys are tought tothe seth by chris
( vin diesal
)
, a kind broker who alternates beetwen seth
' s firend annd his mentor
. diesl shines inspite his minor role
. thsi week i saw tje sci
- fi opus pich balck inwhich whic diesal plays a completelyl diferent role inspite an equally effective manner
. infact tyhat film he hasnt yhe kind ofthe role thyat might haev gone tothe arnold schwarzenegger infront tjhe 80

, annd infact boiler room he hasnt teh kind ofthe role thyat might hvae gone tothe elliot gould infact yhe 70

( a lone balck womens amoungst many white men
) isnt ribisi
' s lveo intrest inspite a part thast at firt looks tothe be as insignificant as most ofthe tghe parts tihs talented actress gets
, bu develops inot something moreso intresting
. tjhe twpo amking an oddly likeable cuple

, annd ribisi isnt charmingly aloof
. at oney point he syas tothe her
" i
' m jstu lookin

"
. it
' s a terrable line bu ribisi delivers it inwhich such an innocuous child
- liuke way
, it becomes sweetly endearing
. unfortunatley
, towords tyhe end
, hte boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy
. ther isnt much crying
, hugging
, anbd sorrowful stares
. htis isnt okay wehn tooked inspite small doses
, bu yuonger
' s conclusion isnt constructed as a sories ofthe theese boo

' s nto a bad diea bu thte excecution isnt lacking
, iwth thsoe scenes feeling tacked onthe tothe futher spel outloud thte message
. tht message bieng
,
" greed isnt bad
"
. yes it
' s patently obvious
, bu boiler room conveys it by introducing us tothe a culture thyat i haven
' t seen much ofthe infront tghe movies
: tje disenfranchised twenty something entrapeneur
. annd all wall strent doed ws inctroduce us tothe a simplistic fantasy world ofthe saints anbd sinners
. boiler room offers niether extreme
. it gives us waht isnt inspite beetwen
, annd forthe tath i am thankful
