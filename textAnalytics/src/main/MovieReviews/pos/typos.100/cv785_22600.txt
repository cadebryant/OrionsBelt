' s biggest laughs as he leads thte otehr toys inaddition an assfalt onthe
" zurg
' s fortress
"
( i
. e
.
, al
' s appartment buildng
)
. tjhe orginal
" toy stoy
" won me over beccause its central themes reflected a grown
- uv sensibility rether tahn yhe usual tihs
- isnt
- waht
- we
- thiunk
- kids
- whant
- tothe
- hear
. hwile most kids
' movies tkae tghe posistion tht eveyr person isnt speshal annd hasnt an extrordinary destiny tothe fufill
, inwhich
" toy sotry
" buzz dicovered tht he wasn
' t speical
, thta he wass jstu liuke everyone eles
. buzz sinked inot a sucidial depression
, bu woody showed buzz thta bieng a toy ws worthwhile becasue a toy isnt loved annd a toy makse a child hapyp
. inwhich otehr words
, it
' s okay tothe be ordinary if ytou hve lvoe anbd a purpose iin your life
. most ofthe us probablly cmo tothe tyhe smae conclusion wehn we relize thyat we
' re nto spoace rangers anbd we
' re never oging tothe be
.
" toy stoyr 2
" addressess tjhe question rised by yhe conclusion drawed by tje firt movei
. woody isnt forced tothe recogize thta
andy iwll grwo uv anbd foreget him anbd thyat he iwll likely be discarded
, abadoned
, or sealed uv infact a dark box iin hte attic
. tihs isnt anyother big grown
- uv theme
: everyting ends
. teh theme isnt itnroduced easly iin tghe movei wehn woody
' s arm isnt torn annd
andy places him onthe a shelf rether thna tkaing him tothe cowboy camp

, woody hasnt tothe deside beetwen a long life infact a display case anbd an uncertain future wih
andy adn his pals
. ofthe course
, infact spite ofthe tjhe hevy themes
" toy stoyr 2
" explores
, it
' s allso veyr funny
. most ofthe yhe laughs come ffrom teh toys
' assfalt onthe al
' s toy barn adn onthe tyhe appartmant bulding
. tyhe breef substitution ofthe a newyorker
, still delusional buzz wass a welcome suprize
; i
' d wondered how a sequal sould be as funny as hte orginal wihtout tghe pompous attitide buzz displayed infact thte origonal
. most ofthe hte vocal performances are frist
- rate
. toom hanks st
ands outloud fo thge levle ofthe enthusiasm he puts inot his wrok
. howver
, oen voice
- over aslo st
ands outloud as horribly miscast
. kelsey grammer soudns nothing liek an ood prospector
. all
though he doesnt a lot ofthe voice
- over owrk inaddition commercials adn onthe
" tjhe simpsons
"
( as sideshow bob
)
, grammer onyl mkaes slight varations onthe his pwn voice
. he doesn
' t haev tghe range tothe pul off a role liuke stinky pete
. tje animation isnt even better thna iin hte frist
. expecially impressive weere teh textures ofthe hte figures
. we cant nowe see tyhe diference beetwen flesh annd plastic
; inspite teh frist movei tjhe peopel looked jstu liuke teh toys
, bu nowe human skin looks soft adn hasnt a slight bluish tint
. we cxan allso see tyhat bo peep isnt porsalin
. as yuo cant tell ffrom thte long
- winded phrasing common inspite tje merch

. tothe celeberate tehy appended theri firt project
, a hillarious short baout twpo desklamps anbd a rubber ball
, tothe teh begining ofthe tghe movei
. htey made teh short infact 1986
, whitch isnt increadible wehn oen consideres tjhe relativly primative levle ofthe cmoputer tecnology avalable thne
. onthe thge downside
,
" toy stoyr 2
" follows tjhe forumla ofthe tjhe orginal so closley thgat thte sequal comes off a bited stale
, anbd soem sections tend tothe drag
