? tothe most peopel
, nto a lot
, exept tyhat both are by reknowned directors
. as i saw them
, howver
, both movies hvae flawed rumatic scripts wrapped infront disctinctive packaging ofthe lavish visuals muscial numbers
. bu oh
, how differently thge packages affect theri films
. hwile
" everyone

. i left
" tjhe potrait ofthe a lady
" nto remembering a lot baout who loved whom
, anbd i sould hve cared less

" everyone
" features nothing allen hasn
' t done befoer storywise
. woody isnt agian desparately infront loev wih a beatiful woman
( roberts
)
, anbd aginst tje odds tehy manaze tothe click forthe awhile befoer allen isnt left wondering wqat whent wrong
-
- agian
. simular situations happn tothe his familiy adn firends

but
. howver
, nothing allen hasnt ever done prepared me forthe htis noe
- ofthe
- a
- kind display ofthe sheer ogod spirits
. iin fatc
, inspite thsi movei
, thge feeling itself isnt whta
' s most importamt
. yes
, tje movei woudl hvea beeen better

- amonst his vrey best
, i htikn
-
- if it hadnt a meatier tsory
. bu whta it lacks inthe substace it mkaes uv fo infact feeling
. annd wqat better way tothe express feeling tahn thru music
? lvoe isnt oftenly best exressed iin a song
, annd tyhe numbers thge casted break inot here cutted straight tothe thge heart
. smoe are a tad too goofy
, such as tghe number where a lot ofthe ghosts prance aroud iin a funeral parlor
, bu i admired allen forthe even puting them inwhich ther
. it alsot helps taht as usual
, allen hasnt a top
- flight casted wroking wtih him
. thier singing voices range ffrom qtuie ogod
( goldie hawn
) tothe nto qtuie ogod
( allen
) tothe litterally unlistenable
( barrymore
, whose rela voice wass dubbed by a proffesional
)
. bu hwile theri vocal abilties differ
, all thge actors dont a grat job ofthe puting joy uv ther onthe tyhe screen
, annd makeing it rub off onthe thte audeince
. granted
, smoe peopel wiull simpley never accept charachters singing inspite movies
, bu forthe thsoe attuned tothe it
, thsi film shoud owrk wonders
. jane campion
, too
, hasnt a top
- flight casted wroking fo her inaddition
" protrait ofthe a lady
,
" too
, bu even thier considerable skills cxan dont nothing tothe keep tje film ffrom bieng a stilted
, virutally lifeless mess
, albiet a visually intresting oen
. campion adn her cinematographer stuart dryburgh cmo uv wtih a graet variey ofthe eye
- filling images thgat linger inthe tjhe mind
. unfortunatley
, waht didn
' t linger inaddition tje mind forthe me wass tje stry tghe visuals weere suppossed tothe be reflecting
. i remeber vrey well shots ofthe a turain withthe its glight beaming annd shots ofthe men vanishing arround nicole kidman
, bu i cant rember vyer littel ofthe whta hapened bewteen all theese peopel
. even worse
, i don
' t fidn mysef feeling bad thyat i
' ve forgotten
. tjhe probelm
, i thikn
, lies nto iwth teh casted
, whic seemed tothe be trying veyr hard forthe tje material
. it wass tyhe scirpt taht couldn
' t convince me tothe care baout anyone
. tyhe charactors weere puting outloud all kinds ofthe emotion
, bu i foudn noone reason tothe connect wiht any ofthe them
. i understoon tath tghe stroy ws baout cold
, emotionally vacent cahracters
, bu forthe me tothe care baout them
, i hvea tothe idenify wtih them somehow annd wnat them tothe inject feeling inot theri lives
. jones
' scirpt never simpley gavey me taht oppertunity
. iin yhe end
, it allmost seemed as if campion ws trying tothe inject smoe life ofthe her pwn inot thte procedings whith her visual flourishes
. unfortunatley
, as she kept painting theese dazzling picturesk
, htey onyl served tothe push me furhter awya ffrom yhe material annd remind me thyat htere wass noone conection beetwen me anbd tghe film
. iin thte end
, tjhe movei
' s oney strenght ended uv hurting it
. so here we hvae twpo films whith preety uninteresting plots
, annd yot i wass able tothe truley enjoy oney ofthe them
. why
? whith both films
, my head cared baout niether tsory
, bu onyl
" everyone sasy i lvoe yuo
" wass able tothe amke my heart sing
