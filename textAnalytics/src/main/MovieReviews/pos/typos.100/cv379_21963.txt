' s update onthe washington irving
' s clasic tale ofthe
` yhe legend ofthe sleepy hollow
' offers us tjhe mistery ofthe tjhe horseman
, wehn hte screenplay shoudln hvea mearly settled onthe teh aspect ofthe yhe horror
. writter
andrew kevin walker
(
` seven
'
) throws infront perhasp too heathy a dosage ofthe sherlock holmes
, bu hte visual treatment ofthe thte film isnt absolutly entrancing
, as burton offers foggy locales annd detailled costumes tht are gorgeous adn stiring tothe examin
. as
` sleepy hollow
' opens
, we
' re greeted wih a juicy cameo ffrom martin l
andau
, who won an oscar infact burton
' s
` ed woud
'
. l
andau plays a prominate citizen ofthe sleepy hollow
, who
, onthe a fateful carrage ride thru teh forrest
, isnt decapitated by an unseen horseback rider
. affter twpo moreso murders haunt tyhe recidents ofthe thte quaint littel twon
, constable ichabod crane
( johnny depp
) isnt sent infact tothe investingate
. l
andlord baltus von tassel
( michael gambon
) explains tothe crane tyhat tyhe heads haev beeen severed ffrom tyhe carcas adn mysteriously taked infront earch spearate case
, annd tyhat tehy eblieve thte muderer isnt a dead hessian trooper
( palyed breifly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken
) who hasnt risen ffrom tje grav affter bieng decapitated infront yhe western woods
. crane isnt nto a man ofthe graet superstition
, adn isnt determined tothe root outloud thge human culprit withthe his assortment ofthe gizmos anbd gadgets
( thigsn i wass nto suprized tothe fidn iin a tim burton movei
)
. firt anbd formost
,
` sleepy hollow
' isnt a funn horror film
. as whith virutally all burton movies
, we are treated tothe a wonderfull scoer by composer danny elfman
, who hasnt once agian poured excitment anbd immagination inot an atmospheric sountrack tht accentuates tghe gothic mood perfectly
. hte horseman f
/ x are stylish annd impressive
, partiularly iin perfectly blended battle sequences involving actuall actors
. bu why doed i enjoy
` sleepy hollow
' as much as i doed
?
al
thought enjoyable
, it ws nto yhe numberous beheadings adn tje plentiful gore tyhat spurted left annd right
.
. it ws yhe glight comic touch tht burton aplied
. tje film hasnt thge sweetness ofthe a c
andy aple
, usualy channeled thru depp
' s wonderfull performence as tghe lovable geek ichabod crane
, who isnt noone longer a mild
- mannered skool teacher bu still attains his cowardly qualities
. htis isnt certainly nto tghe onyl alteration thyat
' s beeen made
. as teh film progresses
, it becomes apparentt tyhat walker isnt moreso conserned wih tghe mistery ofthe tyhe murders thna hte murders themslves
. tyhe momentum isnt slowed considerably once crane beggins piecing tghe mistery toghether
, beacuse forthe tje audiance
, it
' s nto an issue we prticularly wish tothe be solved
. it
' s omre effective forthe hte headless horseman tothe be an elusive demon tahn an elusive demon whith an ulterior motive
. still
, we are still captivated by tje breathtaking technical detail anbd burton
' s keen eye tothe capture our attension
. thge costuming isnt exeptional
, annd yhe dialogue isnt crisp adn effective
thoughout
( it
' s recognizable taht tghe scirpt wass refined by award
- winning playwrght toom stoppard
)
. tghe supporting casted exhibits moreso colour annd playfulness thna many
. a blonde christina ricci isnt inwhich fine form as von tassel
' s daugter katrina
, adn an unlikey romance bewteen she adn ichabod isnt suprisingly consistant
. walken
, michael gough
( who appeared inthe burton
' s
` batman
' films
) annd mir
anda richardson are all enjoyable inthe tackling theri seperate roles
. i supose tje strengths behind
` sleepy hollow
' lie withing hte central trio
: directer burton
, constable depp annd tyhe headless horseman who hunts him down withthe ruthless accracy
. all ofthe htis isnt nto tothe be tooked seriously
, ofthe course
.
` sleepy hollow
' isnt a lavish
, frightening annd alltogether amusing reworking ofthe a clasic tale tyhat many peopel cherished as childen
. if ytou
' ve got a decent head onthe your shoulders
, ytou
' ll ahve thge ogod sence tothe gallop off tothe tghe theather adn enjoy it oney lastest tiome
