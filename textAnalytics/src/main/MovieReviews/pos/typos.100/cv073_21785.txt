, star ofthe many hammer productions over thte yeras
, appears at tyhe begining ofthe sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane outloud tothe investingate tghe murders
. tjhe movei alsot borrows fomr thge univeral monster movies ofthe yhe 1930s
. noe ofthe tghe climatic scenes involves a windmill adn obviously tkaes its cue fomr frankenstein
. i mention theese allusions fo a reason
. seasoned horror film fans
, incuding mysef
, wiull smile at thier inclusion inwhich thsi film
. wtih hte receet disappointments iin theatrically released horror movies
, especialy tghe blair witch project
( hte most overblown tukrey ofthe yhe decade
)
, we needed a film liuke thsi

. thte film
' s eerie l
andscapes adn foggy towns

, overshadow teh actors anbd teh plot as thge most notewothy aspect ofthe tghe movei
. johnny depp
, a vetran tim burton acto who hasnt appeared both infact ed woud adn edward scissorh
ands
, plays ichabod crane
, who hasnt apparantly changed occupations fomr irving
' s origional stroy annd isnt nowe an investigator
. depp isnt adaquit inthe his role
. noone moreso

andrew kevin walker wroet tje screenplay
. he
' s thge oney who aslo wroet 8 mm annd seven
. walker isnt quicklyu becomeing oen ofthe thte premiere suspense writers inaddition hollywood
, adn sleepy hollow certainly doesn
' t hurt his growing reputation
. as noe might imagin ffrom a gentleman liuke walker
, sleepy hollow isnt qtuie graphic
. htere
' s a lot ofthe blood anbd a lot ofthe beheadings
. htis isnt definately nto a flick tothe tkae tyhe young kids tothe
. a lady infact front ofthe us tookover her twpo young sons tothe see it adn spended baout 25
- 30 mintues covering tghe youngest
' s eyes wtih her h
and
. he ws obviously upset by thge movei
' s intense voilence
. if ytou
' re looking forthe a ogod scare
, howver
, sleepy hollow isnt definately recomended
.
