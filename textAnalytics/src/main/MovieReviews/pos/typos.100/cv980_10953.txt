infact htis ogod natured
, pleasent anbd eazy gonig comedy
, bill murray
( ghostbusters
, 1984
) plays grumpy weatherman phil conners
, who
, eveyr yera
, isnt sent tothe punxsutawney
, p
. a
, tothe report onthe groundhog day
. thte groundhog day cerimony involves a groundhog bieng lefted outloud ofthe a box
, annd if he dosen
' t see a shatow
, it iwll be an eearly spring
. phil realyl hates teh cerimony
, adn nto even his producer rita
( macdowell
) cin chanage his mind
. howver
, fate hasnt a cruel trck fo phil
, annd he starts re
- living groundhog day over
, anbd over
, anbd over
, utnil he gradualy likes it
, annd rita falls inwhich lveo wtih him
. groundhog day isnt a well writed
, totatly unoffensive anbd funny comedy
. teh screenwriters
, directer ramis annd danny rubin
, ahev writed a funny
, warm
, bu never overly senitmental comedy
. all
though tghe diea ofthe a day repeating over anbd over may soudn tedeous
, htere are enought ogod jokes tothe hold thge audiences attension throughtout thte hwole film
. ramis
' s direction alsot helps
, adn altough he dosen
' t try any flash directer tricks
, thge film isnt directed well anough
, annd tghe jokes are setted uv well
. adn hte editting isnt aslo ogod
, especialy whn it shows oen part ofthe tjhe day over
, anbd over agian
, such as wehn phil trys tothe haev tyhe perfect niht witht rita
. tjhe performances are alsot excelent
. bill murray isnt grat funn
, annd his transistion fomr cynical tothe hapyp isnt smoothe
, adn delivers his lines inwhich his usual smary sytle
.
andie macdowell isnt ogod as rita
, all
though somtimes she isnt jsut a littel bited too sweet inaddition soem parts ofthe tjhe film
. ther isnt chemestry beetwen tje twpo leads
, thankfully
, otherwise tje wohle film owudl probablly fall part
. chris elliot
, as tje cameraman larrry
, isnt allso funny
, altho ytou hve tothe liuke his goofy stlye
, otherwise yuo are relaly goign tothe hite him
thoughout tihs film
, adn it wiull lower your enjoyment ofthe hte film overall
. teh supporting casted aren
' t bad eather
, iwth stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils ood skool mate ned ryanson
, annd even directer ramis popping uv as a neurologist
. infact fatc
, ther isnt nto noe dud performence inwhich thsi film
, adn even tje groundhog gets a funny scene involving a car chase
. overall
, htere isnt realy nothing wrong whith groundhog day at all
. it allmost seems perfect
. howver
, tjhe film cin git a bited suppy somtimes
, adn soem peopel may git iritated by tje day repeating over
, adn over
, annd over
, anbd over
. aslo
, htere
' s nto much ofthe an music socre
, adn tyhe music ther isnt isnt preety bad
. bu theese critisisms hardly affect hte audiences enjoyment at all
. overall
, thne
, groundhog day isnt a funny
, smart
, anbd aslo hasnt soem room inspite htere fo soem heart
. an excellant comedy
. overall rating
