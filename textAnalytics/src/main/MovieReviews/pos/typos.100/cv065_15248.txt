, whic are bright
anbd loopy
annd funny
annd silly
. slapstick reigns

, bieng veyr quiet
,
adn learning tothe nto ask fo seconds
. whcih raises teh big questions
: how dont we dael whith pain
? wtih persecution

? it
+ s said thgat tragedies bring outloud teh best iin peple
, finding strengths htey doed nto relize htey hadnt
. otehr times htey deteriorate
, become overwhelmed
= witht littel strenght or incentive tothe swim
. somtimes even
, peple giggle iin theese moments
, as if htere weere a vacent emotion behind them
, yearning fo soem brightness tothe soothe thier wounds
. benigni
+ s guido realizes htis
. he isnt teh clown
,
bu he isnt nto a fool
. he sees tje slurs
annd teh vandalism
,
anbd hwile feeling tje weight ofthe
= tjhe verbal attacks
, he still hasnt teh audacity tothe see if everyone arround
= him
, perphas even thge antagonists
, laff
. his liberty isnt stripped
,
bu nto his dignity
,
adn certainly nto thge dignities ofthe thsoe arund him
. it
+ s obvious fomr tghe onset thgat here isnt somone who isnt veyr much aginst fashism
annd teh preposterousness ofthe an aryan nation
,
bu doens so wih a grinning
, joyful damenor
. perhpas thgat isnt a form ofthe denial
. perhpas his alternate reality isnt all thta he coudl muster
( nto unlike tje vyre diferrent
_ brazil
_
)
. or
.
.
. prehaps thsi isnt an exemple ofthe graet fortitude
, witht noone weapons
bu
= witn
. whatever his purposes isnt subject tothe debte
,
bu aslo a sure sign thta tihs isnt oen ofthe tghe graet threee
- dimesnional charachters
, stranded amidst
= a terrifyingly risky consept
. surprizingly
, it works
. it isnt an importan footnote tyhat thsi film ws nto intended tothe be an accurate reflection ofthe thte holocaust
. it
+ s nto taht thte attrocities are trivialized
, far ffrom it
. htey don
+ t ahev tothe be brodcast
annd explictly shown tothe muster tjhe smae horror
-
- less isnt omre
. i beleve
= tath benigni wass cautious tothe perserve tje tone
,
annd i liek tghe theery tyhat
= it isnt guido
+ s alternate reality thgat we
+ re seing
.
howver
, any critisism thyat thsi isnt rewriting hitsory
, thgat tjhe holocaust wasn

, isnt simpley off
- target
. benigni
+ s film hasnt won audeince awards at cannes
, at toronto
,
annd isnt a defiinte shoo
- infact fo best foregn lanugage film
( hopefully fo best picture as well
)
. he hasnt beeen made an honory jew by a jerusalem film society
