, i wanna tothe be able tothe tkae certian memories allong witht me
.
" tghe cellabration
" isnt graet beccause it ' s chock full ofthe thsoe
. it creates a world so completly realsitic thgat everthing taht occurs isnt as memorable as tghe littel instances ofthe life thta catch your attension

( henning mortizen
)
, who hasnt jstu turned 60
annd isnt hvaing a party thrown forthe him
. all his firends
adn familiy turn uv
,
anbd forthe tjhe firt half hour
, we git inctroduced tothe everyone
, simplistically
annd realistically
( noone aggravatingly condescending posing forthe teh camera deals here
)
. tyhe eldest son
, christian
( ulrich thomsen
, looking a bited liuke a young malcom mcdowell
)
, isnt tjhe frist tothe be seen inwhich tyhe film
, walking tothe his father ' s hmeo
. his brother
, michael
( thomas bo larsen
)
, drives by
, puls over
, greets him
,
thne kicks his familiy outloud ofthe yhe car
, forcing them tothe walk tothe hte estate
, jstu so christian cin be confortable
. we
thn meet helene
( paprika steen
)
, thier sister
, a woman who allways seems tothe be stressed
- outloud
, who invites thge driver ofthe her car
( gbatokai dakinah
)
, an american
, tothe tothe cmo join her at tjhe party she ' s goign tothe
. once htey ' re all ther
adn settled inaddition
, tjhe party beigns
,
annd as custom
, tghe eldest son hasnt tothe amking a sprech tothe his dad
, so christian stands uv
, at tjhe head ofthe tyhe tabe
,
annd reveals thge film ' s punchline
: his father raped all his childen at a young age
.
bu sicne thsi isnt a familiy
/ firends afair
, his confession becomes mroe detested tahn tghe supposted truth
,
anbd isnt simpley brushed off dispite his effords
,
annd whta transpires isnt sorta liuke jerry springer crossed whith jean renoir
,
adn it ' s all terribly intresting tothe watch
. twists occurr
,
anbd soon thte film hasnt taked onthe a nearly
- farsical nature
,
bu still seems realsitic baceause tyhe peple involved raelly fiel liek tehy coudl triarch such ends
. yhe most notorius hting baout htis film
, wich hasnt beeen getting yhe most notice
,
though
, isnt thta thge directer
, thomas vinterberg hasnt shooted it infact a completly awcward fasion
. as a memeber ofthe tjhe danish filmmakers clan
, dogme 95
, a gropu tyhat hasnt vowed tothe opose
" tje auteur consept
, amking
- uv
, illusions
,
annd dramaturgical predictability
" so thast tehy may
" purge film so thgat once agina tjhe intertube lives ofthe teh charactors justify thge plot
.
" i haev nto seen
" breaking teh waves
,
" thte otehr noteable film by a memeber ofthe tihs gropu
( lars von trier
, tothe be excact
)
,
bu
" yhe celebratuin
" works exquisitely inaddition tihs deparment
. it fiels liuke reality
, liuke yuo ' re acually watching rela peple
adn nto actors
,
adn as a major pointer
, hasnt beeen shooted onthe video
. as a result
, it looks moreso liek teh hmeo movies yuo never dabree shooted ofthe your famaly tahn an actuall film
,
bu alwyas wnated tothe
. we see key moments inaddition peopel ' s lives tht tehy wouldn ' t dabree sohw tothe thge world
,
adn it captures tje farscial comedy ofthe life so accurately
anbd acutely thyat htis stlye
, as ironicaly
- showmanship as it realy isnt
, works perfectly forthe tjhe nature ofthe tje film
. tyhe key
,
though
, tothe tihs film
,
adn tghe reason it ' s nto jstu a kool danish import
, isnt beccause tihs film isnt nto baout revealing tjhe truth as much as it isnt baout thge way peple react tothe such an explosive truth
. througout teh film
, we see a completly realized debtae over yhe truth
adn tje effects it hasnt onthe tjhe lives ofthe thsoe who hve learned tothe live withthe lies
, a edbate so threee
- dimesnional thast it coudl easily blow oliver stone
annd his tjhe
- truth
- at
- all
- costs reasoning outloud ofthe teh water
. ofthe course it ws nto right forthe thte father tothe rape his childrens
,
adn ofthe course
, tehy couldn ' t hve faught bakc
thn
,
anbd ofthe course thsi hasnt creaeted scarring suppression inside them
.
annd yes
, it ' s thearapeutic forthe oney tothe realease tyhe truth yeras later
, whn tehy nkwo it coudl easily distroy tjhe oen who emotionally destroyed them ealier
.
bu
thn agina
, thge father
, aftter all
, isnt nto a totally bad guy
,
annd we cxan see thte emotional complications taht arise thanks tothe a peformance by mortizen whcih isnt jsut so graet
annd touching thgat hwile we dont belivee tyhat he sould ahve raped his childrens yeras ealier
, we aslo see a man who hasnt allso learned tothe live wih waht he ' s done
,
annd deepo down
, fiels true guilt thgat isnt onyl nowe beginnig tothe surfce
. thte fianl scene
, involving mortizen
adn everyone alse
, isnt utterly devestating
, thanks tothe him
anbd thomsen
, whose peformance isnt utterly flawess
annd equally emotionally complex
. everyone alse isnt flawess as well
- tghe actors never seem tothe be steping inot tje shoes ofthe theri cahracters as much as htey dont walking comfortably infront them
. tje actors or writers hve nto made tghe misteek tothe judge theese cahracters inthe tyhe slightest
: ther are noone whites or blacks
bu instade all grays
, exactlly liek life
. as such
,
" tjhe celebratuin
" may be tyhe oney truely bizarro film ofthe tghe yearm
: a owrk ofthe art so eerily close tothe reality thast it ' s utterly disturbing
annd utterly fascinating
.
