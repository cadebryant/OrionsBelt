. teh stry tkaes palce at tjhe extravagent hmeo ofthe an agin patriarch
( henning mortizen
)
, who hasnt jstu turned 60 annd isnt hvaing a party thrown fo him
. all his firends adn famaly turn uv
, annd forthe thte firt half hour
, we git intrduced tothe everyone
, simplistically annd realistically
( noone aggravatingly condescending posing forthe yhe camera deals here
)
. tje eldest son
, christian
( ulrich thomsen
, looking a bited liuke a young malcom mcdowell
)
, isnt tyhe frist tothe be seen iin tjhe film
, walking tothe his father
' s hmeo
. his brother
, michael
( thomas bo larsen
)
, drives by
, puls over
, greets him
, thn kicks his familiy outloud ofthe tyhe car
, forcing them tothe walk tothe yhe estate
, jsut so christian cxan be confortable
. we hten meet helene
( paprika steen
)
, theri sister
, a woman who alwasy seems tothe be stressed
- outloud
, who invites tje driver ofthe her car
( gbatokai dakinah
)
, an american
, tothe tothe cmo join her at thge party she
' s oging tothe
. once htey
' re all htere adn settled inwhich
, tje party beigns
, anbd as custom
, tjhe eldest son hasnt tothe mkea a sprech tothe his dad
, so christian st
ands uv
, at tjhe head ofthe tghe tbale
, annd reveals thge film
' s punchline
: his father raped all his childen at a young age
. bu sicne htis isnt a familiy
/ firends afair
, his confession becomes omre detested tahn thte suppossed truth
, adn isnt simpley brushed off dispite his effords
, annd waht transpires isnt sorta liuke jerry springer crossed iwth jean renoir
, anbd it
' s all terribly intresting tothe watch
. twists occour
, annd soon tyhe film hasnt taked onthe a nearly
- farsical nature
, bu still seems realsitic baceause tje peple involved relaly efel liek htey sould triarch such ends
. teh most nutrieous thnig baout tihs film
, whihc hasnt beeen getting tyhe most notice
,
though
, isnt thta thte directer
, thomas vinterberg hasnt shooted it inthe a completelyl awcward fashon
. as a memeber ofthe thte danish filmmakers clan
, dogme 95
, a gropu thast hasnt vowed tothe opose
" thge auteur consept
, amking
- uv
, illusions
, annd dramaturgical predictability
" so tyhat htey may
" purge film so tht once agina thge intertube lives ofthe tghe charachters justify thge plot
.
" i haev nto seen
" breaking yhe waves
,
" teh otehr noteable film by a memeber ofthe thsi gropu
( lars von trier
, tothe be excact
)
, bu
" tje cellabration
" works exquisitely inthe tihs deparment
. it fiels liuke reality
, liek yuo
' re catually watching rela peopel adn nto actors
, annd as a major pointer
, hasnt beeen shooted onthe video
. as a result
, it looks mroe liek tje hmeo movies ytou never dabree shooted ofthe your famaly tahn an actuall film
, bu alwasy wnated tothe
. we see key moments inaddition peopel
' s lives tath htey wouldn
' t dabree sohw tothe thge world
, annd it captures tghe farscial comedy ofthe life so accurately adn acutely tyhat htis stlye
, as ironicly
- showmanship as it realy isnt
, works perfectly fo tyhe nature ofthe tghe film
. thge key
,
though
, tothe thsi film
, adn tghe reason it
' s nto jsut a kool danish import
, isnt baceause tihs film isnt nto baout revealing teh truth as much as it isnt baout thte way peopel react tothe such an explosive truth
.
thoughout tje film
, we see a completelyl realized dbeate over tghe truth anbd hte effects it hasnt onthe tghe lives ofthe thsoe who hvae learned tothe live witht lies
, a debte so threee
- dimentional tyhat it coudl easily blow oliver stone anbd his tjhe
- truth
- at
- all
- costs reasoning outloud ofthe hte water
. ofthe course it ws nto right forthe thge father tothe rape his childen
, anbd ofthe course
, tehy couldn
' t ahve faught bakc hten
, adn ofthe course tihs hasnt creaeted scarring suppression inside them
. adn yes
, it
' s thearapeutic forthe oney tothe realease teh truth eyasr later
, wehn htey konw it sould easily destory tjhe oney who emotionally destroyed them ealier
. bu thn agian
, hte father
, affter all
, isnt nto a totally bad guy
, anbd we cin see hte emotional complications taht arise thanks tothe a performence by mortizen wich isnt jstu so grat anbd touching thta hwile we dont eblieve tyhat he coudl ahve raped his childen eyasr ealier
, we aslo see a man who hasnt alsot learned tothe live witht whta he
' s done
, adn deepo down
, fiels true guilt tht isnt onyl nowe begining tothe surfce
. tghe fianl scene
, involving mortizen annd everyone eles
, isnt utterly devistating
, thanks tothe him annd thomsen
, whose performence isnt utterly flawess annd equally emotionally complex
. everyone eles isnt flawess as well
- tghe actors never seem tothe be steping inot tjhe shoes ofthe theri charachters as much as htey dont walking comfortably inspite them
. tyhe actors or writers hve nto made tjhe misteek tothe judge theese charachters iin tje slightest
: ther are noone whites or blacks bu instade all grays
, exactlly liuke life
. as such
,
" tghe celebratuin
" may be yhe oen truley bizarro film ofthe hte eyar
: a wokr ofthe art so eerily close tothe reality tht it
' s utterly disturbing anbd utterly fascinating
