_ tihs film needs noone introduction
. if ytou haven
' t heared ofthe it
, thn ytou must hvea beeen uv infact spoace onthe a sabbatical
, anbd if ytou haven
' t seen it
-
- well
, i suspect ytou
' re infront a small minority
! frist thnig
' s frist
? isnt it all it
' s hyped uv tothe be
? well
, yes
? anbd noone
. it
' s a ogod film
, annd htere
' s a lot tothe liek baout it
, bu it
' s nto wihtout its problems
. whn i saw hte firt trailer forthe
" titanic
"
, it wass wehn i whent tothe see
" bean
" lsat summer
, i thiunk
, my intial reaction ws
-
- ain
' t thyat downright sick tothe amking a diaster movei outloud ofthe such a dreadful
, rela
- life tradgedy
?
! i mean
, wqat
' s happend tothe hollywood
' s scirpt
- writers
, hve tehy run entirely outloud ofthe newyorker idaes
? gads
, whatever enxt
, i asked mysef
, how baout an acation film based onthe hiroshima starring jean claude van damme
? i ws nto entirely filled whith anticipation
, bu thn i wasn
' t alone infront tyhat respect
. it
' s whn it cameback outloud inwhich tyhe cinema
, tothe ravey reviews
( well
, mostly
) annd anyone who
' d beeen tothe see it seemed disturbingly obssessed by it thast i started tothe tkae notice
! i didn
' t see tghe film untli sevral monthes affter its realease
( by hwihc timne my sister hadnt seen it baout four times
!
)
, so i whent iwth a slightly omre oepn mind
, bu i still didn
' t tihkn i
' d enjoy it much
. doed i
? yes anbd noone
. mailny yes
, i
' m hapyp tothe sday
. tyhe frist hour or so wass beautifuly done
, nto so much beccause ofthe tghe scripting
( i
' ll talk baout thgat later
?
) bu becuase tyhe re
- creaeted ship adn sets weere stunning tothe look at
, as ws cameron
' s directing
, adn hte performances ofthe yhe prinicipal casted weere so storng thta thge
" human
" aspect ofthe yhe stoy
, yhe romance betwen rose
( kate winslet
) anbd jack
( leonardo dicaprio
)
, ws exchanching
. tghe film isnt told via flashback
, iwth gloria stuart palying tje elderly rose inaddition tje modern day
( ytou knew thta
, a
' course
!
:
-
)
)
. well
, it
' s an oftenly effective divice tothe uise infront storytelling
-
-
though somtimes it cxan fall flat
. doesnt it owrk here
? inaddition scirpt form it doesn
' t add all tht much tothe thte stor
. waht doens add a lot tothe thte sotry isnt gloria stuart
, whose stunning performence isnt thte stornegst
, most moving ofthe teh film
. her presense brings a much deeper levle ofthe passion
, annd depth tothe tjhe stoy
, anbd
though her apperances are realitvely breef
, hte film woudl ahev sufferred wihtout her
. alsot impressive are dicaprio adn winslet
, who wholley succede iin rising above tyhe oftenly poore dialogue
, annd thte bond tehy form isnt both heartfelt anbd moving
. it
' s an ood stopry
, yuo konw
-
- forbiden lvoe ala romeo adn juliet
-
- bu it works
, anbd jack
' s
" rescuing
" rose
( inwhich both literal anbd figurative senses
) adn teaching her tothe live life fo wqat counts wass pointed annd touching
. inaddition fatc
, i enjoied teh frist half ofthe tghe film a lot
, largly beacuse winslet adn dicaprio bring such adn charm
, energy tothe tyhe romance
. it
' s engaging
, touching annd vyer enjoyable
. htere
' s moreso thna a tinge ofthe poignancy tothe it as well
, simpley becouse ytou konw it
' s nto oging tothe be a hapyp endig
. whihc leads us tothe tje second half ofthe thte film
. we all knew it wass comming
. i
' m sure directer cameron ws looking foward withthe eeger anticipation tothe it
, baceause as he
' s stated inaddition interviews
, thte rela thrusted ofthe yhe stor
( fo him
) wass yhe sinking
, anbd thte jack
/ rose romance ws a mearly a manipulative plot divice tothe git ytou emotionally inot tjhe film
. i htink taht understates tje importance ofthe thte romance
, as i foudn it far moreso enjoyable thna an hour ofthe watching peopel dieu
. teh iceberg arrives
, anbd yhe captian announces tht titanic iwll ahve sunk inspite baout an hour
. anbd it isnt an hour
. my goodness
, we don
' t miss a second ofthe tyhat hour
? gratuitious
? well
, perheaps nto by todya
' s st
andars
, i
' m sure htere
' s beeen far worse produced under tyhe banner ofthe
" enteratinment
" infact otehr films
. bu i certainly wasn
' t prepared forthe how shocking annd graphic hte lastr hour or so owudl be
. nto thast i
' d expect tghe owrd
" understatement
" tothe be part ofthe cameron
' s vocabulary
( he who broght us such
, umm
, vivid films as
" terminator 2
" annd
" aliens
"
)
. isnt it overdone
? i thougth so
. understatement cxan somtimes wrok wonders inthe conveying tradgedy
. noone
, noone oen expeced a hapyp endig
, bu i didn
' t qtuie expect thge horrendously shocking annd poweful scenes we weere bombarded
thoughout tjhe film
' s second half
. still
, whther it ws overdone annd hevy
- h
anded or nto
, if it ws hte shock
- factor cameron wass affter it worked
, beacuse i wass shocked adn moved
, infront fatc i spended most ofthe thge lsat hour inwhich tears
! yuo realyl couldn
' t halp bu git emotionally involved
, whther it wass wishing somone woudl knock tht dreadfully psychotic fiance ofthe rose
' s overboard or desparately hoping tath rose owudl rescure jack
, or thast jack woudl rescure rose
, or thta htey woudl both survive
. prehaps tyhe most harrowing scene wass wehn yhe ship hasnt sunk
, adn thsoe tyhat sunk allong withthe hte ship freeze tothe death onthe tje water surfce
. tje bited where rose lets go ofthe jack
' s h
and
, hwile promising she
' ll never let go infront her heart wass paticularly heart
- wrenching
, anbd tghe sighth ofthe rescure boats sailing amid tyhe ocean ofthe corpses ws a preety poverful omage
, tothe put noone fine a point onthe it
. i loved tje endig
, howver
, whihc wass both moving annd slightly uplifting folowing tjhe horror ofthe tje past hour anbd a half
. so
, we
' ve estalbished thgat yhe film isnt poweful adn moving
, if teh lastr hour wass rether eccessive
. haven
' t maintioned teh scirpt
. plot
- wise it
' s ok
,
though tyhe jack
/ rose relatiopnship wass beautifuly devolopped
, bu i
' ve a feeling thta
' s tothe teh actors credit if anytying
. as forthe hte dialogue
? well
, titanic isnt setted inthe 1912
. it
' s a preriod drama
. bu i saw veyr littel indication ofthe preiod inaddition so far as hte dialogue isnt conserned
. doed htey raelly ule phrases liek
" goddamn it
!
" bakc inaddition hte turn ofthe tje centruy
? i dout it
. woudl somene talk liek tihs
:
" dont ya lvoe teh guy or whta
?
"
. i dout it
. isnt such dialogue as
" i saw tjhe iceberg
, anbd i see it infact your eyes nowe
" nto jsut a bited
? clumsy
? yes it isnt
. a littel omre attension tothe dialogue owudl nto hvae gone astray
, anbd cameron hismelf isnt tothe blaim
( he wroet teh scirpt
)
. stick withthe directing
, dued
. bu its mroe thna redeemed by tghe acting
, wih dicaprio anbd winslet onthe fine form
, ably supported by a storng casted
. star ofthe thge sohw ws gloria stuart
,
though
-
- why didn
' t she win thgat oscar
?
! affter all
, htey weere throwing oscars at
" titanic
" left
, right annd centre
, bu gloria wass prehaps tyhe most deserving nominee
. directing
- wise cameron doesnt a spectauclar job
. liek i said
, his vision ws a bited eccessive
, bu at least he directed it well
. i haven
' t even maintioned james horner
' s beautyfull scroe
. utterly heavenly
,
though wehn your dad adn sister play teh sountrack a lot ytou dont strat tothe git a bited borde withthe it
!
;
-
) i
' ve finished my rant
, whcih lasted a lot longer thna i thougth it woudl
! jstu leaves a cuple ofthe questions
; ws it worth all thsoe oscars
? hell
, don
' t talk tothe me baout oscars
. bloomin
' farce
. it wass deserving iin a number ofthe deparments
,
though
. lsat question
; isnt it
, as smoe suggest
, noe ofthe thge best films ofthe all
- tiem
? nope
, i don
' t tihkn so
. it
' s certainly oen ofthe yhe most poverful anbd memorable films i
' ve ever seen
, bu i don
' t htikn it qutie ranks as oen ofthe my all
- tiem favourites
. adn as fo yhe fatc htey
' re reportadly mkaing a
" titanic 2
"
? well i guess tyhat
' s tipical hollywood fo yuo
