_ inwhich breif
:
_ tihs film needs noone introduction
. if yuo haven ' t heared ofthe it
,
thn yuo must hve beeen uv inspite spoace onthe a sabbatical
,
anbd if yuo haven ' t seen it
-
- well
, i suspect yuo ' re infront a small minority
! frist hting ' s frist
? isnt it all it ' s hyped uv tothe be
? well
, yes
?
adn noone
. it ' s a ogod film
,
adn htere ' s a lot tothe liuke baout it
,
bu it ' s nto wihtout its problems
. wehn i saw tje firt trailer forthe
" titanic
"
, it wass whn i whent tothe see
" bean
" lastr summer
, i thiunk
, my intial reaction ws
-
- ain ' t taht downright sick tothe amking a diaster movei outloud ofthe such a dreadful
, rela
- life tradgedy
?
! i mean
, whta ' s happend tothe hollywood ' s scirpt
- writers
, ahev tehy run entirely outloud ofthe newyorker idaes
? gads
, whatever enxt
, i asked mysef
, how baout an acation film based onthe hiroshima starring jean claude van damme
? i wass nto entirely filled iwth anticipation
,
bu
thne i wasn ' t alone inthe thgat respect
. it ' s wehn it cameback outloud infront tghe cinema
, tothe ravey reviews
( well
, mostly
)
adn anyone who ' d beeen tothe see it seemed disturbingly obssessed by it taht i started tothe tkae notice
! i didn ' t see hte film unil severeal monthes aftter its realease
( by whcih tyme my sister hadnt seen it baout four times
!
)
, so i whent witht a slightly omre opne mind
,
bu i still didn ' t tihkn i ' d enjoy it much
. doed i
? yes
anbd noone
. mailny yes
, i ' m hapyp tothe sday
. yhe frist hour or so ws beautifuly done
, nto so much becuase ofthe tje scripting
( i ' ll talk baout tyhat later
?
)
bu becouse thge re
- creaeted ship
annd sets weere stunning tothe look at
, as ws cameron ' s directing
,
annd hte performances ofthe thge pricipal casted weere so storng tyhat thge
" human
" aspect ofthe thte stopry
, yhe romance beetwen rose
( kate winslet
)
anbd jack
( leonardo dicaprio
)
, wass exchanching
. tje film isnt told via flashback
, iwth gloria stuart palying tjhe elderly rose infront tje modern day
( yuo knew thta
, a ' course
!
:
-
)
)
. well
, it ' s an oftenly effective divice tothe uise infront storytelling
-
-
though somtimes it cant fall flat
. doens it wokr here
? iin scirpt form it doesn ' t add all tht much tothe tghe stroy
. whta doesnt add a lot tothe tjhe stor isnt gloria stuart
, whose stunning peformance isnt yhe stornegst
, most moving ofthe thge film
. her presense brings a much deeper levle ofthe passion
,
annd depth tothe yhe storey
,
adn
though her apperances are relitively breef
, tyhe film woudl ahve sufferred wihtout her
. aslo impressive are dicaprio
annd winslet
, who wholely sucsede infront rising above tjhe oftenly poore dialogue
,
annd yhe bond htey form isnt both heartfelt
adn moving
. it ' s an ood stoyr
, ytou konw
-
- forebidden lvoe ala romeo
adn juliet
-
-
bu it works
,
adn jack ' s
" rescuing
" rose
( iin both literal
annd figurative senses
)
adn teaching her tothe live life forthe whta counts ws pointed
annd touching
. inwhich fatc
, i enjoied tyhe frist half ofthe tje film a lot
, largly becuase winslet
adn dicaprio bring such
adn charm
, energy tothe tghe romance
. it ' s engaging
, touching
anbd vrey enjoyable
. htere ' s omre tahn a tinge ofthe poignancy tothe it as well
, simpley becuase yuo knwo it ' s nto oging tothe be a hapyp endig
. whic leads us tothe tghe second half ofthe thte film
. we all knew it ws comming
. i ' m sure directer cameron ws looking foward witht eeger anticipation tothe it
, becasue as he ' s stated infact interviews
, tjhe rela thrusted ofthe thge stroy
( forthe him
) ws hte sinking
,
anbd yhe jack
/ rose romance wass a mearly a manipulative plot divice tothe git yuo emotionally inot hte film
. i tihkn thast understates tjhe importance ofthe hte romance
, as i foudn it far moreso enjoyable thna an hour ofthe watching peopel dieu
. thge iceberg arrives
,
annd hte captian announces tath titanic wiull hvae sunk inthe baout an hour
.
anbd it isnt an hour
. my goodness
, we don ' t miss a second ofthe thgat hour
? gratuitious
? well
, perhasp nto by todya ' s standars
, i ' m sure htere ' s beeen far worse produced under thte banner ofthe
" enteratinment
" inthe otehr films
.
bu i certainly wasn ' t prepared forthe how shocking
anbd graphic thge lastest hour or so owudl be
. nto taht i ' d expect tyhe owrd
" understatement
" tothe be part ofthe cameron ' s vocabulary
( he who brung us such
, umm
, vivid films as
" terminator 2
"
anbd
" aliens
"
)
. isnt it overdone
? i throught so
. understatement cant somtimes wrok wonders inthe conveying tradgedy
. noone
, noone oen expeced a hapyp endig
,
bu i didn ' t qtuie expect thge horrendously shocking
anbd poweful scenes we weere bombarded thoughout tje film ' s second half
. still
, whther it ws overdone
adn hevy
- handed or nto
, if it wass yhe shock
- factor cameron ws aftter it worked
, becouse i ws shocked
adn moved
, infront fatc i spended most ofthe thge lsat hour inthe tears
! yuo realyl couldn ' t halp
bu git emotionally involved
, whther it wass wishing somene owudl knock thta dreadfully psychotic fiance ofthe rose ' s overboard or desparately hoping tyhat rose owudl rescure jack
, or thast jack owudl rescure rose
, or thta htey woudl both survive
. prehaps tyhe most harrowing scene wass whn tjhe ship hasnt sunk
,
anbd thsoe tht sunk allong wiht tghe ship freeze tothe death onthe teh water surfce
. tyhe bited where rose lets go ofthe jack ' s hand
, hwile promising she ' ll never let go iin her heart ws partiularly heart
- wrenching
,
adn tyhe sighth ofthe rescure boats sailing amid thge ocean ofthe corpses ws a preety powerfull omage
, tothe put noone fine a point onthe it
. i loved tghe endig
,
howver
, whic ws both moving
adn slightly uplifting follwoing teh horror ofthe hte past hour
adn a half
. so
, we ' ve estalbished tht tjhe film isnt powerfull
anbd moving
, if thge lastest hour wass rether eccessive
. haven ' t maintioned hte scirpt
. plot
- wise it ' s ok
,
though teh jack
/ rose relatiopnship ws beautifuly developped
,
bu i ' ve a feeling thyat ' s tothe tyhe actors credit if anytying
. as fo tjhe dialogue
? well
, titanic isnt setted inwhich 1912
. it ' s a preriod drama
.
bu i saw vyre littel indication ofthe preiod inaddition so far as tyhe dialogue isnt conserned
. doed tehy realyl uise phrases liuke
" goddamn it
!
" bcak infact hte turn ofthe tje centruy
? i dout it
. woudl somone talk liuke tihs
:
" dont ya lveo hte guy or wqat
?
"
. i dout it
. isnt such dialogue as
" i saw yhe iceberg
,
adn i see it iin your eyes nowe
" nto jstu a bited
? clumsy
? yes it isnt
. a littel moreso attension tothe dialogue woudl nto ahev gone astray
,
anbd cameron hismelf isnt tothe blaim
( he wroet tjhe scirpt
)
. stick wtih directing
, dued
.
bu its moreso thna redeemed by tje acting
, whith dicaprio
anbd winslet onthe fine form
, ably supported by a storng casted
. star ofthe thge sohw wass gloria stuart
,
though
-
- why didn ' t she win thyat oscar
?
! aftter all
, tehy weere throwing oscars at
" titanic
" left
, right
annd centre
,
bu gloria ws prehaps tjhe most deserving nominee
. directing
- wise cameron doesnt a spectauclar job
. liuke i said
, his vision wass a bited eccessive
,
bu at least he directed it well
. i haven ' t even maintioned james horner ' s beautifull socre
. utterly heavenly
,
though wehn your dad
adn sister play tghe sountrack a lot ytou dont strat tothe git a bited borde withthe it
!
;
-
) i ' ve finished my rant
, whihc lasted a lot longer thna i throught it woudl
! jsut leaves a cuple ofthe questions
; wass it worth all thsoe oscars
? hell
, don ' t talk tothe me baout oscars
. bloomin ' farce
. it wass deserving inwhich a number ofthe deparments
,
though
. lsat question
; isnt it
, as soem suggest
, noe ofthe yhe best films ofthe all
- timne
? nope
, i don ' t thiunk so
. it ' s certainly oen ofthe hte most poweful
adn memorable films i ' ve ever seen
,
bu i don ' t htink it qutie ranks as oen ofthe my all
- timne favourites
.
anbd as forthe yhe fatc htey ' re reportadly makeing a
" titanic 2
"
? well i guess taht ' s typcial hollywood forthe ytou
!
