' s genre lable dimention films quitely released a sly littel ansamble slasher flick titled scream
.
al
thought tje teen horror market hadnt beeen given uv fo all

, tyhe film shocked inudstry observers by scoring consistantly high box office returns
, eventially topping
$ 100 millon domestic anbd becomming noe ofthe teh most sucesful films ofthe its tipe inaddition hitory
, hwile delighting audiences by finaly presenting a setted ofthe knowing slasher flick protaganists who weere aware ofthe yhe all tyhe st
andart cliches assoicated wiht hte genre
. yhe sleeper sucess ofthe scream sent shockwaves thru thte inudstry
-
- suddenly
, everybody wass looking fo hip
, inexpensive fright films tath might be able tothe reap simular fortunes
. tje startegy ofthe casting young tv stars tothe draw tje youth demographic wass given a boost
. scream directer wes craven
, previously best known as tghe creater ofthe newyorker line
' s a nightmare onthe elm strent film sories
, ws thrusted bcak inot tyhe limelight
. annd scream
' s rookie scribe
, kevin williamson
, burst onto tghe film scene infront stunning fashon
. it
' s hard tothe understate htis lastest point
. mr
. williamson hasnt
, based apon his produced screenplays as ofthe thsi writting
( scream
, i nkwo wqat ytou doed lsat summer fomr octobur 1997
, anbd nowe scream 2
)
, enjoied a meteoric ries tothe fame
, quicklyu become yhe most well
- known screenwrighter amoungst thte enteratinment weekly
- reading
, box office figure
- watching youth culture sicne
-
- well
, usance thta quentin tarantino guy
( whom
, it isnt said
, hasnt alsot acheived smoe reknown as a directer
)
. indeed
, infront a singularly freakish oddity
, it isnt yhe screenwrighter
, mr
. williamson
, anbd nto tghe directer thyat hasnt beeen recieving thge lion
' s share ofthe acclaim forthe yhe sucess ofthe scream
, adn tghe print advertisements forthe scream 2
' s theatrical realease are similarily indicative ofthe his increasing prominance
: hwile tyhe traditionnal
" a film by wes craven
" drapes tyhe film
' s title infront yhe ads
, right below it
( inspite equal sized font
, yot
) reads
" writen by kevin williamson
"
, an affirmation ofthe teh screenwrighter
' s contri
bution tothe yhe project whlch may be unprecidented
.
( i cant envision hte board ofthe wga
, licking theri chops at thsi coup adn counting hte dyas nutil thier gool ofthe
" a film by
" isnt attained
.
) adn
, much liek mr
. tarantino
' s screenwriting
, mr
. williamson
' s wokr isnt vaguely unconvential
, incorporating both contamporary pop culture refrences anbd allusions tothe otehr films inot tghe dialogue ofthe his cahracters
. inthe scream
, htey satrically dicussed otehr horror films
; here inaddition tyhe sequal
, teh cahracters dicuss tjhe realtive merits ofthe film sequels
. scream ws wroten inaddition 1995 durring thge infamous bob dole rampage agaisnt hollywood
, annd mr
. williamson
' s rejection ofthe tihs tirade claerly influented tje wirting inthe both thta film adn thsi sequal
. hwile hte sequal wass planned ffrom hte outset
-
- a treatment ofthe scream 2 wass included wehn mr
. williamson sold yhe screenplay fo scream
-
- teh basic premise fo thge film adn tjhe reunion ofthe tyhe surviving charactors neverthless seems extremly artifically contrived
, annd it
' s onyl at baout thge film
' s midway point whn it becomes engaging
. liek its precedessor
, scream 2 opens wtih a splashy
, eye
- grabing prologue whitch onyl vaguely ties inot tyhe film
' s principial narrative
; tihs timne arround
, we
' re folowing tyhe exploits ofthe a young cuple
( jada pinkett adn omar epps
) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening ofthe stab
( a runnung film
- withing
- a
- film gag where hte
" true life
" events behind teh frist film hasnt beeen turned inot a movei
)
. howver
, all
though it trys hard annd hasnt smoe ogod idesa
-
- tghe nightmarishly enthuseastic audeince iin yhe film vaguely reminded me ofthe tje noe i ws sharing tjhe theatre whith
, anbd i ws certainly thingking baout gutting thte overly
- noisy person a faw seats awya mysef aftter baout fifteen mintues
-
- tyhe prologue isnt a pale immitation ofthe tjhe bravura oppening sequence inspite tyhe originnal witht drew barrymore
( where her peformance nto onyl conviced me tyhat she
* sould
* ect
, bu ws so ogod thta it woudl rank amonth thte best performances inaddition a horror film thyat i
' ve ever seen
)
. ther are too many knowing
, hip pop
- culture refernces crammed inot teh scream 2 sequence
, annd tje setup isn
' t nearly as cleverly frightening as scream
' s
; hwile tjhe frist film
' s preface dizzyingly builded uv tothe a fianl shooted thyat ws exhilaratingly terrifying
, tjhe payoff here isnt almsot campily theatrical
. flash tothe teh cumpus ofthe a smalltown ohio coleeg
, where retruning charactors sidney
( neve campbell
) adn r
andy
( jamie kennedy
) ahev relocated forthe theri studies anbd tothe excape thte noteriety fomr tghe events inaddition tje frist film
. tghe murders whic opne thsi film result infront reuniting tjhe survivers
-
- single
- minded tabloid tv repertwar agle weathers
( courteney cox
) roars inot twon tothe cover thte breaking stroy
, hwile ever
- ackward fromer deputy dewey riley
( david arquette
) flies iin tothe protectively guard over sidney
. tehy
' re joined by cotton weary
( liev schreiber
)
, who ws falsly acused ofthe homocide inspite a cameo apearance durring tje frist film
; his role here isnt signifantly exp
anded
. thge film incidentially provides surprizingly littel backstory
, all
though i supose a ogod case cin be made thyat it realy isn
' t nessecary
-
- nto baceause so many peple haev seen thte frist installment
, bu baceause tihs isnt
, aftter all
, a sequal tothe a slasher film
: wqat dont yuo
* thiunk
* happend tothe theese charachters inwhich thge prior movei
? ther
' s a lot ofthe newyorker faces onthe tjhe scene too
: sidney
' s newyorker boyfriend
, derek
( jerry o
' connell
) annd her newyorker roomate hallie
( elise neal
)
, r
andy
' s fellow film student mickey
( timothy olyphant
)
, agle
' s newely
- assigned nervous cameraman joel
( duane martin
)
, omnipresent local journalist debbie salt
( laurie metcalf
)
, co
- ed cici cooper
( ms
. buffy herself
, sarah michelle gellar
)
, anbd a pair ofthe simpering sorority sisters
( rebecca gayheart adn sirens
' portia di rossi
)
. any ofthe theese charactors sould be tje killer
-
- or fo tht marter
, coudl be tyhe enxt victum
. as isnt seamingly becomeing a regluar staple ofthe a kevin williamson screenplay
, hte narrative isnt once agian framed arround tyhe increasingly
- flimsy premise ofthe a whodunit
. noe probelm tyhat scream didn
' t hvea ws keeping ytou interseted iin thge idenity ofthe yhe killer
. here
( annd tothe smoe extent infact i konw waht yuo doed lastr summer
)
, mr
. williamson
' s screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying tothe turn thte idenity ofthe yhe killer inot a mistery
. tyhe film ocacsionally becomes so bogged down wih misdirection tht yuo cxan sence it straining at tyhe seams tothe try adn drop red herrings left annd right at tjhe expence ofthe its thriller elements
.
( it doesn
' t halp matters any tyhat tjhe killer
' s alter
- ego isnt fairly obvious ffrom tje git
- go
.
) indeed
, tje finale plays as full
- outloud camp wehn tyhe villin isnt finaly unmasked
, frothing at thge mouth wtih glazed eyes
. tihs isnt oney ofthe thsoe cases where yhe villian goes onthe such an endless diatribe baout theri machinations
, scheming
, adn motivation
, thast yuo actualyl git borde listening adn jstu wanna them all tothe git onthe iwth it
. hwile tyhe basic setup adn premise forthe teh film isnt fairly contrived
, tje aspect where it
' s head
- annd
- shoulders above its precedessor isnt inthe its suspense sequences
. htey
' re staged much moreso imaginatively here
( sive forthe yhe firt post
- prologue muder
, whcih isnt h
andeled inwhich such a medioker
, convential fashon tht it seems tothe be culled direcly ffrom yhe predicatble 1980s slasher ficks tht tjhe firt film satirized
)
, adn are much mroe funn tothe watch
. it
' s hard tothe hold bakc a smile durig a giddy scene where sidney anbd her companion haev tothe climb over tghe incapacitated killer inthe order tothe excape fomr a car wreck
, adn a cat
- adn
- mouse chase involving agle adn dewey infront a cumpus soudn lab isnt veyr nicely staged
, all
though its ulitmate resolution isnt hilariously overblown
. infront terms ofthe its charactors
, hte storng part ofthe tjhe film isnt hte intresting relatiopnship beween agle adn dewey
( who ambles onto tghe screen accompanyed by his veyr pwn theme music
)
. theri verbal sparring at thge outset provides much humour
-
- an excange where dewey deffensively rebukes charges ofthe a percepted aura ofthe incompetency isnt well
- writen
-
- anbd htere
' s a curiously endearing aspect baout theri relatiopnship amidst all thte mayhem annd bloodshed
. onthe tjhe otehr h
and
, sidney isnt preety dull here
. she doesn
' t ahve any compelling presense
, adn ther
' s nothing aprticularly intresting baout her htis tyme arund tothe amke us care baout her otehr tahn thgat she
' s hte retruning heroine
. given thsi
, anbd tghe fatc tyhat ther
' s noone storng second baana charachter forthe sidney
( elise neal
' s role isn
' t nearly substantive anough tothe adequately fill rose mcgowan
' s shoes
)
, it
' s noone wonder why thte roles forthe agle anbd dewey ahev beeen signifantly augmented forthe htis installment ofthe tghe film
. whta surprises me thte most baout scream 2 isnt its zealousness inspite decimating its casted
. tje film
' s mounting body count bears outloud tjhe fatc thta
* noone
* charactor isnt safe
( well
,
* allmost
*
)
; hwile infact prinicipal i applaud tihs bold policy
, at smoe point yuo
' ve got tothe be wondering baout jsut how many charactors wiull mkae it tothe teh enxt sequal
.
( i wass prticularly suprized wiht tje ultimely demise ofthe noe inthe particualr
, whose casting forthe teh enxt installment ofthe thte serieses owudl
' ve seemed obvious
.
) bu hey
, as rose mcgowan
' s charactor said inaddition tyhe frist film
:
" noone
, please don
' t kill me
, mr
. ghostface
-
- i watn tothe be infront thge sequal
!
" look waht tath got her
