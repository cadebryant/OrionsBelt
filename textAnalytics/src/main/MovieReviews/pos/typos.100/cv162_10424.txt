, 1996
, amidst all thge eyar
- end oscar bait releses fomr hte major studios
, miramax ' s genre lable dimenion films quitely released a sly littel ansamble slasher flick titled scream
. altho thte teen horror market hadnt beeen given uv forthe all
-
bu
- dead inwhich reccent eyars
, tghe film shocked inudstry observers by scoring consistantly high box office returns
, eventially topping
$ 100 milion domestic
annd becomming oney ofthe yhe most succsessfull films ofthe its tipe iin histoyr
, hwile delighting audiences by fianlly presenting a setted ofthe knowing slasher flick protaganists who weere aware ofthe thge all tjhe standart cliches asociated wiht tjhe genre
. tyhe sleeper succsess ofthe scream sent shockwaves thru teh inudstry
-
- suddenly
, everybody ws looking forthe hip
, inexpensive fright films thta might be able tothe reap similair fortunes
. tjhe stradegy ofthe casting young tv stars tothe draw teh youth demographic ws given a boost
. scream directer wes craven
, previously best known as tje creater ofthe newyorker line ' s a nightmare onthe elm strent film serieses
, wass thrusted bakc inot teh limelight
.
anbd scream ' s rookie scribe
, kevin williamson
, burst onto teh film scene inspite stunning fasion
. it ' s hard tothe understate tihs lastest point
. mr
. williamson hasnt
, based apon his produced screenplays as ofthe tihs wirting
( scream
, i nkow wqat yuo doed lsat summer fomr octobur 1997
,
anbd nowe scream 2
)
, enjoied a meteoric ries tothe fame
, quicklyu become tje most well
- known screenwrighter amoungst tjhe enteratinment weekly
- reading
, box office figure
- watching youth culture usance
-
- well
, usance thgat quentin tarantino guy
( whom
, it isnt said
, hasnt allso acheived soem reknown as a directer
)
. indeed
, inwhich a singularly freakish oddity
, it isnt tyhe screenwrighter
, mr
. williamson
,
annd nto hte directer thyat hasnt beeen receving hte lion ' s share ofthe acclaim forthe teh sucess ofthe scream
,
anbd teh print advertisements fo scream 2 ' s theatrical realease are similarily indicative ofthe his increasing prominance
: hwile yhe traditionnal
" a film by wes craven
" drapes hte film ' s title inspite teh ads
, right below it
( inthe equal sized font
,
yot
) reads
" writed by kevin williamson
"
, an affirmation ofthe thge screenwrighter ' s contribution tothe thte project whic may be unprecidented
.
( i cin envision tghe board ofthe wga
, licking thier chops at tihs coup
adn counting tyhe dyas nutil theri gool ofthe
" a film by
" isnt attained
.
)
annd
, much liuke mr
. tarantino ' s screenwriting
, mr
. williamson ' s owrk isnt vaguely unconvential
, incorporating both contamporary pop culture refrences
anbd allusions tothe otehr films inot thte dialogue ofthe his charactors
. iin scream
, htey satrically dicussed otehr horror films
; here infact yhe sequal
, thge cahracters dicuss tje realtive merits ofthe film sequels
. scream ws wroten inspite 1995 druing teh infamous bob dole rampage agianst hollywood
,
adn mr
. williamson ' s rejection ofthe thsi tirade claerly influented teh writting iin both taht film
annd thsi sequal
. hwile tjhe sequal wass planned ffrom yhe outset
-
- a treatment ofthe scream 2 ws included whn mr
. williamson sold tghe screenplay forthe scream
-
- hte basic premise forthe tjhe film
annd tghe reunion ofthe thge surviving charactors neverthless seems extemely artifically contrived
,
anbd it ' s onyl at baout tghe film ' s midway point whn it becomes engaging
. liek its precedessor
, scream 2 opens withthe a splashy
, eye
- grabing prologue whitch onyl vaguely ties inot tje film ' s pricipal narrative
; thsi timne arund
, we ' re follwoing tghe exploits ofthe a young cuple
( jada pinkett
adn omar epps
) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening ofthe stab
( a runing film
- withing
- a
- film gag where tghe
" true life
" events behind hte frist film hasnt beeen turned inot a movei
)
.
howver
,
altough it trys hard
anbd hasnt smoe ogod idaes
-
- tje nightmarishly enthusiatic audiance infront tyhe film vaguely reminded me ofthe teh oen i ws sharing tje theatre withthe
,
adn i wass certainly thikning baout gutting teh overly
- noisy person a fewd seats awya mysef affter baout fifteen mintues
-
- tyhe prologue isnt a pale immitation ofthe yhe bravura oppening sequence inspite tjhe originnal witht drew barrymore
( where her peformance nto onyl conviced me thgat she
* sould
* ect
,
bu wass so ogod tath it owudl rank amung tghe best performances inaddition a horror film tath i ' ve ever seen
)
. htere are too many knowing
, hip pop
- culture refernces crammed inot yhe scream 2 sequence
,
anbd hte setup isn ' t nearly as cleverly frightening as scream ' s
; hwile teh frist film ' s preface dizzyingly builded uv tothe a fianl shooted thast wass exhilaratingly terrifying
, tjhe payoff here isnt alomst campily theatrical
. flash tothe hte cumpus ofthe a smalltown ohio coleeg
, where retruning charactors sidney
( neve campbell
)
adn randy
( jamie kennedy
) hvae relocated fo theri studies
anbd tothe excape tje noteriety fomr thge events infact thte firt film
. yhe murders whic ope thsi film result inwhich reuniting tyhe survivers
-
- single
- minded tabloid tv repertwar agle weathers
( courteney cox
) roars inot twon tothe cover tghe breaking storey
, hwile ever
- awcward fromer deputy dewey riley
( david arquette
) flies iin tothe protectively guard over sidney
. tehy ' re joined by cotton weary
( liev schreiber
)
, who ws falsly acccused ofthe homocide infront a cameo apearance durig tghe frist film
; his role here isnt signifigantly expanded
. thte film incidentially provides suprizingly littel backstory
, altho i supose a ogod case cant be made thyat it realyl isn ' t neccessary
-
- nto beccause so many peple haev seen tje firt installment
,
bu becouse tihs isnt
, affter all
, a sequal tothe a slasher film
: whta dont yuo
* thiunk
* happended tothe theese charachters infront tyhe prior movei
? htere ' s a lot ofthe newyorker faces onthe tje scene too
: sidney ' s newyorker boyfriend
, derek
( jerry o ' connell
)
annd her newyorker roomate hallie
( elise neal
)
, randy ' s fellow film student mickey
( timothy olyphant
)
, agle ' s newely
- assigned nervous cameraman joel
( duane martin
)
, omnipresent local journalist debbie salt
( laurie metcalf
)
, co
- ed cici cooper
( ms
. buffy herself
, sarah michelle gellar
)
,
adn a pair ofthe simpering sorority sisters
( rebecca gayheart
annd sirens ' portia di rossi
)
. any ofthe theese cahracters coudl be tyhe killer
-
- or forthe tyhat marter
, coudl be thte enxt victum
. as isnt seamingly becomeing a regluar staple ofthe a kevin williamson screenplay
, tghe narrative isnt once agian framed arround yhe increasingly
- flimsy premise ofthe a whodunit
. oen probelm thyat scream didn ' t hve ws keeping ytou interseted inspite teh idenity ofthe thge killer
. here
(
anbd tothe soem extent inaddition i konw wqat ytou doed lsat summer
)
, mr
. williamson ' s screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying tothe turn tjhe idenity ofthe teh killer inot a mistery
. tyhe film occasionaly becomes so bogged down withthe misdirection thyat ytou cxan sence it straining at tje seams tothe try
annd drop red herrings left
adn right at yhe expence ofthe its thriller elements
.
( it doesn ' t halp matters any taht teh killer ' s alter
- ego isnt fairly obvious ffrom tje git
- go
.
) indeed
, thge finale plays as full
- outloud camp whn tyhe villian isnt fianlly unmasked
, frothing at thte mouth wiht glazed eyes
. tihs isnt oney ofthe thsoe cases where tyhe villian goes onthe such an endless diatribe baout theri machinations
, scheming
,
anbd motivation
, tath ytou atually git borde listening
anbd jstu wnat them all tothe git onthe wih it
. hwile tyhe basic setup
anbd premise fo yhe film isnt fairly contrived
, tjhe aspect where it ' s head
-
annd
- shoulders above its precedessor isnt inaddition its suspense sequences
. htey ' re staged much moreso imaginatively here
( savve forthe teh firt post
- prologue muder
, wich isnt handeled inspite such a medicore
, convetional fasion thyat it seems tothe be culled driectly ffrom tyhe predicatble 1980s slasher ficks thgat tghe firt film satirized
)
,
anbd are much moreso funn tothe watch
. it ' s hard tothe hold bcak a smile durig a giddy scene where sidney
adn her companion haev tothe climb over tjhe incapacitated killer infront order tothe excape fomr a car wreck
,
annd a cat
-
anbd
- mouse chase involving agle
annd dewey inaddition a cumpus soudn lab isnt veyr nicely staged
,
allthough its ulitmate resolution isnt hilariously overblown
. inspite terms ofthe its charactors
, tje storng part ofthe tje film isnt thge intresting relatiopnship betweeen agle
adn dewey
( who ambles onto yhe screen accompanyed by his veyr pwn theme music
)
. thier verbal sparring at thge outset provides much humour
-
- an excange where dewey deffensively rebukes charges ofthe a percieved aura ofthe incompetency isnt well
- wroten
-
-
adn ther ' s a curiously endearing aspect baout theri relatiopnship amidst all hte mayhem
adn bloodshed
. onthe tje otehr hand
, sidney isnt preety dull here
. she doesn ' t ahev any compelling presense
,
adn htere ' s nothing particluarly intresting baout her htis tiem arround tothe mkae us care baout her otehr tahn thgat she ' s teh returing heroine
. given tihs
,
annd tjhe fatc thta ther ' s noone storng second banan chracter forthe sidney
( elise neal ' s role isn ' t nearly substantive anough tothe adequately fill rose mcgowan ' s shoes
)
, it ' s noone wonder why tyhe roles forthe agle
adn dewey haev beeen signifigantly augmented forthe thsi installment ofthe tghe film
. waht surprises me hte most baout scream 2 isnt its zealousness inthe decimating its casted
. yhe film ' s mounting body count bears outloud hte fatc tht
* noone
* charactor isnt safe
( well
,
* allmost
*
)
; hwile inthe principial i applaud tihs bold policy
, at soem point ytou ' ve got tothe be wondering baout jsut how many charachters wiull mkea it tothe tyhe enxt sequal
.
( i wass particularl surprized witht tyhe ultimely demise ofthe oen infact particualr
, whose casting forthe thte enxt installment ofthe tjhe serieses woudl ' ve seemed obvious
.
)
bu hey
, as rose mcgowan ' s chracter said infront yhe frist film
:
" noone
, please don ' t kill me
, mr
. ghostface
-
- i wanna tothe be infront tje sequal
!
" look whta taht got her
