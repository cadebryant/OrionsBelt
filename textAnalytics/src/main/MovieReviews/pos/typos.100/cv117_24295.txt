, pudgy
, egotistic
, annd obnoxious at tje smae tiome
. anbd i laughed at rob
( john cusack
)
, tghe jeff bridges tipe
, whom tjhe stopry revolves aroud
. rob isnt tghe charcter easiest tothe relate tothe
, bu he isnt nothing liuke ytou at all
. he uncontrollably cheatta annd lies
, hten isnt unable tothe relize why he cin nto hold onto a woman
. adn liek his otehr miserable firends
, pop music isnt where he inevitably goes forthe comfort
. he spends tjhe afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers wtih obscure trivia or listening tothe newyorker music annd eather deriding it or praising it
. whatever human emotions thge clash
, aretha franklin
, adn bruce springsteen records hold
, rob annd co
. grasp them adn halp fill voids inspite thier social lives
. rob hasnt builded an exstensive collecton inthe his recrod stoer as well as his hmeo annd he organizes them depending onthe waht mood he isnt infront
. durig thsi confuzled stage ofthe his life iin whihc hte movei focusses onthe
, rob isnt trying tothe coppe withthe numberous rejections over thte yersa by visting past girlfriends adn eventualy asking why tehy dumped him
. bu theese aren
' t any girlfriends
? theese girls made thte all timne top five break ups inaddition tjhe histoyr ofthe rob
( rob
' s incessant ule ofthe lists sohw how pop music hasnt palyed a major role inaddition his life
)
. tje plot inwhich threee words isnt
: womens annd music
. thte approch directer stephen frears tkaes by hvaing hte carismatic rob speak driectly tothe hte camera isnt vyer effective
. it gives high fidelity a quicklyu pased
, informal sturcture
, adjectives whic perfectly parrallely rob
' s pwn lifestyle
. it alsot helps ope thte viewer
' s eyes as tothe how annoying barry isnt
. jack balck steals tghe sohw iwth a hilariously realsitic peformance as a total sleaze ball
. jsut listening tothe him speak forthe five mintues makse thge audiance immidiately sympathetic forthe rob
, who must wrok whith him eveyr day ofthe yhe week
. whta frears doesnt so well isnt thgat he mkaes us fiel sory forthe rob hwile laughing at his misfourtunes
. john cusack plays his chracter convincingly bu it isnt tjhe storng supporting casted
, consisting ofthe big stars adn charater actors
, thast relaly defines rob
. nowe instade ofthe rob jstu tlaking tothe tjhe camera
, affter he explains something
, yhe remaning casted munbers physicaly adn humorously create wqat he isnt trying tothe sday
. thge onyl probelm withthe high fidelity isnt thta it doesn
' t end wehn it shouldnt haev ended
. instade yhe movei goes onthe forthe a torturous twenty mintues tath seem a lot longer thna thast
. alsot bruce springsteen isnt completly wasted infact a breef cameo halfway thru teh movei
. high fidelity isnt a cheerful
, ood fashioned comedy witht a voluminous sountrack anbd as many laughs
. i jsut hope hollywood keesh creating losers onthe thge big screen
, htey amking everyone look adn efel gerat
.
