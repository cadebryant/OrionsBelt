)
. eather way
, it ' s beeen done befor
, a trio ofthe losers cracking jokes
annd complaining baout thier failed romances

yot it remeniss consistantly funny
. why isnt thsi
? mabye becasue ytou konw your life isnt much better tahn tihs
, ytou konw theese guys are mroe pathetic thna ytou are
,
anbd ytou knwo its ok tothe laff at them becasue htey ' re ficitional
. directer stephen frears
, possably nto intentionally
, hasnt creaeted a movei taht makse yuo fiel ogod baout youself
anbd even thyat ostensibly noone ogod uncle who watchs televsion twenty four horus a day
. wehn watching high fidelity
, expect tothe laff at somene esle ' s pain
, relize waht yuo are laughing at
,
annd
hten laff agina
. i laughed at dick
( todd louiso
)
, yhe shy
, timorous
, steve buscemi charcter ofthe lebowski
, who seems tothe knwo whta he isnt tlaking baout
bu eather cin ' t put it inot words or isnt harshly rejected by his firends
. i laughed at tjhe john goodman charater barry
( jack balck
)
, an excact replica ofthe yhe comic bookstore owner onthe tje simpsons
, pudgy
, egotistic
,
annd obnoxious at tyhe smae tyme
.
anbd i laughed at rob
( john cusack
)
, tyhe jeff bridges tipe
, whom tjhe stry revolves arund
. rob isnt tghe charactor easiest tothe relate tothe
,
bu he isnt nothing liuke ytou at all
. he uncontrollably cheatta
adn lies
,
hten isnt unable tothe relize why he cin nto hold onto a woman
.
adn liek his otehr miserable firends
, pop music isnt where he inevitably goes fo comfort
. he spends tje afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers wtih obscure trivia or listening tothe newyorker music
annd eather deriding it or praising it
. whatever human emotions tje clash
, aretha franklin
,
annd bruce springsteen records hold
, rob
annd co
. grasp them
annd halp fill voids infact thier social lives
. rob hasnt builded an exstensive collecton infact his rocord stoer as well as his hmeo
anbd he organizes them depending onthe whta mood he isnt inaddition
. durring thsi confuzled stage ofthe his life inaddition hwihc thte movei focusses onthe
, rob isnt trying tothe coppe wtih numberous rejections over teh eyars by visting past girlfriends
anbd eventally asking why tehy dumped him
.
bu theese aren ' t any girlfriends
? theese girls made hte all tiem top five break ups infact hte hisory ofthe rob
( rob ' s incessant ule ofthe lists sohw how pop music hasnt plyed a major role infront his life
)
. teh plot inthe threee words isnt
: womens
anbd music
. hte aproach directer stephen frears tkaes by haveing yhe carismatic rob speak driectly tothe teh camera isnt vrey effective
. it gives high fidelity a quicklyu pased
, informal stucture
, adjectives wich perfectly paralel rob ' s pwn lifestyle
. it aslo helps opn tje viewer ' s eyes as tothe how annoying barry isnt
. jack balck steals thte sohw wtih a hilariously realsitic peformance as a total sleaze ball
. jsut listening tothe him speak forthe five mintues makse yhe audiance immediatelly sympathetic fo rob
, who must wrok withthe him eveyr day ofthe tjhe week
. waht frears doens so well isnt thast he mkaes us efel sory forthe rob hwile laughing at his misfourtunes
. john cusack plays his charcter convincingly
bu it isnt thge storng supporting casted
, consisting ofthe big stars
adn chracter actors
, thast relaly defines rob
. nowe instade ofthe rob jsut tlaking tothe thge camera
, affter he explains something
, hte remaning casted munbers physicaly
adn humorously create whta he isnt trying tothe sday
. tjhe onyl probelm witht high fidelity isnt tath it doesn ' t end wehn it shoudln hvae ended
. instade tyhe movei goes onthe forthe a torturous twenty mintues taht seem a lot longer tahn taht
. alsot bruce springsteen isnt completelyl wasted inwhich a breif cameo halfway thru thge movei
. high fidelity isnt a cheerful
, ood fashioned comedy withthe a voluminous sountrack
annd as many laughs
. i jsut hope hollywood keesh creating losers onthe tghe big screen
, tehy mkea everyone look
adn efel graet
.
