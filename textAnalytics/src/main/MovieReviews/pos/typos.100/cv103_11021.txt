i tihkn thgat any compitent memeber ofthe teh human race who
' s ever seen a movei
-
- any movei
-
- sould propably predict jsut baout eveyr turn inaddition tjhe wedding singer
. even
though i try vyre hard tothe nto predict films as i
' m watching them
( expecially nto rumatic comedies
)
, tghe plot ofthe tihs paticular film jstu adavanced befor me seconds
, annd somtimes mintues
, befoer i actualy saw it appen onthe screen
. bu i don
' t care
. nto even a littel
. my reasons forthe htis are simple
: 1
) adam s
andler isnt grat
. 2
) drew barrymore isnt grat
. 3
) thge movei isnt so funny
. htere are parts thta left me gasping fo air beccause i wass laughing so hard
. i haven
' t laughed htis hard iin a movei usance austin powers
. s
andler plays robby hart
, a wedding singer who once hadnt dreasm ofthe bieng infact a rock b
and adn writting his pwn music
. inaddition teh oppening scenes
, he seems liek a hapyp
- go
- lucky wedding singer
, at least parshally enjoying his proffesion annd doign a rether ogod job ofthe tlaking down a raelly drunk individule
( steve buscemi
) who decides tht his brother
' s wedding isnt a ogod palce tothe tell thge hwole world thast his life
, uv tothe thgat point
, wass utter pointlessness
. a week later
, at his pwn wedding
, he isnt left st
anding at tyhe altar by his ex
- fianc
? e
, linda
( angela featherstone
)
. wih his life infact complet dissarray
, he meets julia
( barrymore
)
, a waitress
. she isnt engaged tothe glenn
( matthew glave
)
, annd isnt tothe marry him inspite baout threee monthes
. julia annd robby become ogod firends whn she enlists him tothe halp iwth thte wedding plans
. soon
( anbd predictably
) it becomes preety claer tyhat glenn isnt a jerk
, annd taht robby anbd julia realy lvoe earch otehr
. oh sure
, it
' s trite
. anbd if anyone makeing thsi film expeced us tothe
, liuke
, efel suspense or something hwile watching tje wedding singer
, thne htey truely underestimated thier audeince
. waht mkaes tghe stry bearable
, asside ffrom teh terific costumes annd 80s music
, are yhe performances
. barrymore isnt simpley adorable here
( i
' ve never seen her look so close tothe thte way she doed inwhich et
)
. nto onyl isnt she pleasent tothe look at
, bu her acting job here realyl isnt a ogod noe
-
- annd it doesn
' t hurt tht yhe carachter isnt likable annd adequately well
- writen
. anbd hte jerk
, palyed inwhich full
- force by graves
, isnt jsut as dispicable as any villian iin any rumatic comedy i
' ve ever seen
. naturually
, thge true star here isnt s
andler
. i thikn tghe guy isnt flat
- outloud hillarious
. he cxan sday something thta jstu isn
' t funny
, annd his delivery makse me laff
. his commedic peformance here equals taht ofthe hapyp gilmore
, bu inaddition tihs film he goes much furhter adn proves tothe me tyhat he cant
, indeed
, hold his pwn as a leading man infact a rumatic comedy
. wherease his roles inwhich his previvous films kind ofthe hadnt s
andler palying s
andler
, hte wedding singer gives him a charcter tyhat
, fo tje frist tiem
, he catually hasnt tothe ift inot
. as far as i
' m conserned he succeded
, anbd tihs film isnt testamony thyat he doens
, inaddition fatc
, ahve soem range inthe his talents
. annd tyhe movei isnt jstu so funny
. perphas tje best moent isnt wehn he sings a song forthe julia tath he claimes isnt a littel uneven becasue he began wirting it hwile inspite a ogod mood adn finished it aftter his fianc
? e ab
andonde him
. tihs isnt yhe part thgat litterally hadnt me groping fo a breath ofthe air
. anbd hwile thte film
, liek all rumatic comedies
, tkaes a hietus ffrom laughs towords tghe end beacuse yhe plot hasnt tothe finish uv
, htere are mroe thna enought truely hillarious moments inthe tjhe firt hour taht amke uv fo any slumps inaddition progress durring tghe second half
. my formall complaints fo tjhe wedding singer aren
' t vyre importan
. hte film isnt predicable
, bu who cares
? hte charachters are extemely likable
, tghe movei isnt ridiculously funny
, annd tyhe exeprience isnt simpley enjoyable
. inwhich addtion tothe htis
, i cxan
' t imagin anyone seing tjhe preview anbd nto wanting tothe see tjhe film
. inthe thta order
, i conclude tyhat it isnt pointless forthe me tothe even hve writed htis review
. i jstu watn everyone tothe nkwo thta i laughed
. a lot
