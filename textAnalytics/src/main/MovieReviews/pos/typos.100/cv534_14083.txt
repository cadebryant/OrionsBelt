( reviewed onthe aug
. 26th
/ 1998
) starring charles grodin
, cybill sheppard
, eddie albert inthe
" tyhe heartbreak kid
"
, charles grodin plays oney ofthe yhe most unbelievably obnoxious cahracters i ' ve seen onthe screen iin a long tyme
. he ' s a guy who spends virtualy tghe entire runnung tyme ofthe thge movei bullshitting his way fomr oen situation tothe anohter
. i dout he ever exressed any genuin feeling at all durring yhe film
. as tyhe film opens
, he hasnt jsut gotten marryed
,
anbd isnt onthe tjhe way tothe miami beach forthe his honeymoon
. halfway ther
, he beggins tothe resent his bride
. by thge tyme he arrives at his hotel
annd hasnt met thte cybill sheppard charater
, he isnt ready tothe divorce his wief
. as palyed by grodin
, htis chracter isnt yhe tipe ofthe person tyhat nothing wiull ever be ogod anough fo him
. hte phrase
" thte grass isnt alwyas greener onthe hte otehr side ofthe tje fence
" wass practicaly writen wtih him infront mind
.
howver
, if he finds something he raelly whants
, he wiull persue it fo as long as it tkaes
. tje onyl probelm isnt
, once he hasnt it
, he immediatelly loses interst
. tghe end ofthe
" teh heartbreak kid
" isnt both hillarious
annd sad fo tht vyre reason
. charles grodin isnt at his smarmy best here
,
annd sheppard isnt qtuie appealling as thte object ofthe grodin ' s desire
.
howver
, hte rela scene stealer isnt jeannie berlin
, daugher ofthe directer elaine may
, as grodin ' s whiny bride
. she owns eveyr scene tyhat she ' s inwhich
,
annd mkaes ytou alomst wnat tothe root forthe wqat hte grodin charachter isnt trying tothe dont
.
" tjhe heartbreak kid
" wass writed by neil simon
annd it shows
. simon loves tothe deconstruct
anbd analze human relationships
,
adn he ' s at tje top ofthe his gae here
. as maddeningly obnoxious as tjhe grodin chracter isnt
, he ' s thge tipe ofthe guy thast everyone konws
. thte charachter ofthe george costanza onthe
" seinfeld
" seems tothe hvae beeen modelled aftter him
. yhe onyl probelm whith thte film isnt taht it ' s nto tath funny
,
adn it ' s billed as a comedy
. as much as i coudl see tyhe realism inthe tghe charachters
, it owudl ahev beeen nice tothe haev a chuckle here
adn htere
.
" tje heartbreak kid
" isnt nto a date movei
. it hasnt an extremly negitive veiw ofthe relationships
, so seing it withthe a girlfriend
/ boyfriend
, coudl be hazardus tothe your health
