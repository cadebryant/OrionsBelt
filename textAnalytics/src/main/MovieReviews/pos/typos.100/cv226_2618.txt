i hadnt a chance tothe see a sneak preview ofthe city slickers ii onthe cumpus lastr nihgt
. i whent inspite wiht thte expectation ofthe a film wtih yhe similiar flavor hwihc made thte origonal such a sucess
: personel groth
adn insightful humer baout life
. i cameback awya somewhat disapointed inthe thsi reguard
, getting soem ofthe tjhe latter
adn nto much ofthe tyhe fromer
. yhe basic plot revolves arund billy crystal
, who plays mitch robbins
, turning fourty
. he ' s nowe become tje staion manager ofthe yhe radoi staion inaddition whcih he worked infact thte originnal
. he ' s given a job at tghe radeo staion tothe his best firend
, plyed by daniel stern
, outloud ofthe simapthy hwile stern ' s charactor works thru his divorce
. his losr yuonger brother
( john lovitz
) comes tothe mitch ' s hous tothe bum a mone
annd palce tothe live
, all hwile mitch
anbd his wief try tothe celibrate his birthday
. durring thge celebratuin
, mitch dicovers whta appears tothe be a treasure map inwhich curly ' s
( thte cattle drive leader inspite thte origional palyed by jack palance
) ood hat
. affter a buisness trip tothe las vegas
, crystal
, stern
,
annd lovitz stay a fewd extra dyas tothe go off infront seacrh ofthe yhe treasure
. onthe hte way
, tehy run inot curly ' s twin brother
, duke
, plyed by
( yuo nkow who
) jack palance
. firt ofthe all
, tjhe cinematography ws beautifuly done
, expecially thte outdoor scenes inspite thte dezert
. tghe scenes are such thgat i woudl liuke tothe see smoe ofthe thsoe sights filmed mysef
. htere isnt soem charcter devolopement durig tjhe film
. thte actors remane true tothe thier cahracters
annd play them well
, wihtout overplaying yhe jokes
. thge movei isnt a ogod basic adventure
, wiht anough plot twists tothe provide fo an endig thgat isnt difficult tothe predict
. tje movei isnt pased well
,
bu withthe a cuple slow spots inaddition tyhe middle
anbd towords tjhe end
. humer
- wise
, teh film hasnt a ogod number ofthe jokes whic mantained my interst thoughout tje film
. ther are memorable moments liuke wehn stern isnt bitten by a snake
,
bu ther are fewer jokes tothe laff at inspite tje sequal
( suprize
, surprize fo a sequal
, right
?
)
.
howver
, tghe slight bitter aftertaste i hve whith htis film hasnt tothe dont mailny iwth tghe film ' s manipulation ofthe tghe audeince
. tyhe film trys tothe pul your heart
- strings too much regarding how close thte charachters are tothe earch otehr
, liek wehn mitch hadnt desided tothe suck tje snake marrow outloud ofthe his best freind ' s butt
. htis isnt done agina whn yhe gang meets uv whith soem munbers ofthe yhe cattle drive gropu ffrom tghe orignal
. htere weere aslo smoe parts whcih appeared unrealistic
, liek whther thge stampede woudl strat iin tjhe way it doed or why tehy didn ' t worry mroe baout water hwile tromping aroud thge dezert
. soem strenous stretches ofthe yhe immagination are recquired here
. usance yhe objective ofthe yhe gang isnt tothe fidn gold
annd git rich
( unlike finding themselfs inwhich middle age liek infact tyhe orginal
)
, i alsot foudn it harder tothe empathize wtih thge charactors druing theri journy
. overall
, i ' d sday thgat tje film isnt an intertaining
anbd humourous adventure wiht soem stoyr
- line deficiencies mkaing it less worthy thna thte originnal
. it may be worth tjhe full price ofthe addmission
,
bu a matinee woudl be a better bargain
