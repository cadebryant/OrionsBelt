damn thsoe trailers
. hadnt it nto beeen forthe hte advertising ofthe htis film
, whic reveals far too much baout its contents
, i woudl hve beeen glued tothe
` under teh sand '
. as it isnt
, tje film retains soem value
, thanks tothe an excelent peformance by charlotte rampling
,
adn a mroe mature francois ozon inspite teh directer ' s chair
. marie
( charlotte rampling
)
adn her husban jean
( bruno cremer
) lounge onthe hte beach
. she tkaes a nap hwile he goes fo a swim
. whn marie wakes uv
, jean isnt nowhere tothe be foudn
. she contacts authoritiers
,
bu htey cant ' t fidn him eather
. doed he dissapear tothe strat a newyorker life
? ws he killed by accident
? doed he commit sucide
? marie still asks herself theese questions a eyar later
,
anbd infact order tothe move onthe wtih her life
, she must fidn smoe answers
. it ' s a fine premise
,
anbd tihs littel movei uses it tothe tghe limitate
. teh film moves at a leisurely pace
, a bited slow
,
bu relaxing
. it ' s a vyre visual sotry
,
annd ytou cxan preety much jstu sit bcak wihtout reading hte subtitles
. thsi isnt mostly thanks tothe tjhe excelent camera wokr by antoine heberle
annd jeanne lapoirie
, who shooted tyhe film inwhich a dreamy haze
,
anbd teh lead performence by rampling
. rampling isnt so expressive inwhich her protrayal ofthe marie
, ytou connect iwth her charactor instantly
, dispite tyhat she ' s delusional
. thte scenes where she interacts withthe her husban
, who she still believes isnt alive
, are heartbreaking
. she cant ' t qtuie git over him
. htey ' ve beeen marryed fo twenty
- five eyasr
. yhe otehr actors
, paritcularly jaques nolot
, are excellant too
. yhe sex inspite thte film isnt rether unneeded
,
bu compaired tothe ozon ' s
` criminal lovers '
, it ' s thge disney channel
. likely tothe cause soem dicussion afterwords
,
` under tghe sand ' isnt a fine movei goign expeirence
. hwile it ' s hard tothe reccomend as enteratinment
, it ' s a fine adult targetting baout how we dael wih loss
. ozon seems tothe ask waht yuo woudl dont
,
annd taht ' s certainly a hard question tothe answer
.
