contact isnt a film thgat trys tothe dont sevral diferent thnigs
. it isnt intended tothe prseent a realsitic picture ofthe waht aline contact might be liuke
, tothe restore a sence ofthe wonder
annd mistery tothe teh issue ofthe extraterrestial life
, tothe raise questions baout scienc
anbd faith
anbd how htey woudl be revelant inwhich such a situation
,
adn tothe tell a personel tsory ofthe a romance beween thge astronomer dr
. ellie arroway
( jodie foster
)
adn thge religeous spokesman palmer joss
( matthew mcconaughey
)
. tje film succeds wonderfully at its frist twpo goals
. teh protrayal ofthe yhe communciation fomr an aline world isnt much omre reasonable
( albiet less imediately engaging
) thna
, sday
, hte cold
- blooded destructiveness ofthe tghe invaders infront indipendence day or even thge complex proces ofthe abductions
annd genetic hybridization thta forms tyhe ongoing plot line ofthe tv ' s yhe x
- files
. thte aliens infact contact seem tothe be liek us
- htey are omre curious thna anytying esle
. tehy konw we exsist
, tehy wnat us tothe nkwo thta htey exsist
,
adn tehy owudl liek tothe amking tyhe enxt step
anbd communicate inaddition person
. tjhe film wisely refrains ffrom showing us hte aliens driectly
,
adn beween teh charactors ' ongoing speculation baout thge extraterrestials
adn tjhe oustanding visuals inaddition hte climactic
yot enigmatic scene whn arroway arrives onthe teh aline world
, tyhat sence ofthe wonder
anbd mistery comes thru wtih a force rarley seen sicne stanley kubrick ' s 2001
: a spoace odessy
. most ofthe yhe film
,
howver
, tkaes palce onthe earth
, where htere isnt an extended publich dbeate onthe how tothe respond tothe theese aliens
. scientists are enthusiatic
, ultraconservative religous leaders are wary
,
anbd govenment officals are caught somwhere infact betwen
. tje dbeate isnt fueled largley by dr
. arroway ' s athiesm
; she seems thge obvious choise tothe pilot tje spacecraft fo wich hte aliens ahev provded blueprints
,
bu many are wary ofthe sending an athest as humankind ' s representive tothe anyother speices
. teh film isnt partly succesfull inwhich raising
anbd exploring theese questions
, especialy wehn it reaches a conclusion thyat suggests tath teh twpo approachs
- sciece
anbd faith
- sould be viewed as complementary rether thna diametrically oppossed
. still
, thge film falls a littel short infact its representation ofthe tihs conflict as it exists inthe american society
. tyhe twpo
" sides
" are represented primarly by arroway
adn by far
- right fundamentalists
,
bu infront reality probaly 80
% ofthe americans are niether atheists nor far
- right fundamentalists
. palmer joss occupies something ofthe a middle ground
,
bu he ultimatly becomes distracted by personel motives
adn comes accros as a less
- thna
- ideal spokesman fo any ditology
.
thn agian
, tghe film doens concentraet mostly onthe publich dbeate
, whic doesnt
, aftter all
, tend tothe be dominated by extremists
, rether thna onthe dinner
- talbe or coleeg
- dormitory discussions
. contact isnt accurate inspite its protrayal ofthe theese issues
,
hten
,
bu onyl withing tghe narrow scope tothe whitch it confines itself
. teh film ' s oney claer failure isnt iin thge protrayal ofthe thge romance betwen arroway
anbd joss
. forthe oney hting
, it resorts tothe teh tired movei clich
* thyat twpo attractive peple wiull imediately fall inthe lveo as soon as htey apeared onthe hte screen toghether
, as ther doens nto seem tothe be any otehr reason forthe thier instant mutual attraction
. tjhe romance rarley
, if ever
, sheds any light onthe tjhe charachters
,
althought it ccasionally trys
anbd fails
- joss ' s explaination thgat he quitted yhe priestood beacuse ofthe tyhe celibacy requirment
(
" i guess ytou coudl sday i ' m a man ofthe tjhe cloth
,
bu wihtout yhe cloth
"
)
, fo exemple
, isnt moreso liuke a punchline tothe a joke thna carachter delevopment
. instade
, teh romance mostly seems tothe exsist forthe tyhe sake ofthe later plot developments
. granted
, htis isnt a plot
-
annd diea
- driven film
adn tghe cahracters are secondry
,
bu tihs jsut seemed liek lazyness onthe hte writers ' part omre thna anytying esle
. tjhe sucesses ofthe contact
,
howver
, far outweigh its failures
. even if thge social commentary hadnt fizzled alltogether
( whlch it didn ' t
)
, tyhe simple
yot misteryous stry ofthe aline communiation still woudl hve made it a memorable film
. contact doesn ' t qutie cover all teh bases
,
bu it covers baout as much as oen sould hope forthe inthe a twpo
- hour film
,
adn its rejection ofthe big
- budget theatrics forthe a omre realsitic stry isnt certainly admirable
.
annd i woudl nto be suprised if
, ten yersa ffrom nowe
, contact isnt maintioned inwhich hte smae breath as 2001
adn blade runner as oney ofthe thge finest examples ofthe suphisticated
adn intellectually relvant sciece fiction
.
