usance most movies baout slavery sheild us ffrom tyhe true horrors ofthe whta htey ' re portraing

anbd tath ' s nto necessarally beacuse ofthe tghe threee
- hour runnung tyme
.
" beloved
" isnt chalenging tothe watch
, filled witht tough
anbd poverful peotry tyhat tkaes us completelyl off guard
,
anbd instade ofthe a straight
- foward
, hollywood
- ized stroy baout whta happended tothe tjhe slaves affter tehy weere freed
,
" beloved
" comes off as a cry ofthe anguish ffrom all thsoe who atcually lieved thru wqat hapened
( or
, rether
, toni morrison
, who wroet tyhe novel apon hwihc thsi isnt based
)
.
" beloved
" tells teh stroy ofthe an ex
- slave named sethe
, plyed by oprah winfrey
, who lives onthe a larg farm infact tghe noth whith her childrens
. whn tje film opens
, her hous isnt bieng terrorized by a poltergeist
, hwihc shakes thigsn uv
, wounds tjhe dog
,
annd mkaes thigsn generaly uncomfortable forthe tjhe famaly
. sethe isnt proud
,
though
,
annd wiull nto move
. her sons run awya
, leaving onyl her
adn her daugter
, denver
( kimberly elise
) alone witht thge ghost whic isnt htere wihtout any factual explaination
. a cuple yeras pass
,
adn teh ghost remeniss
,
anbd oney day
, a man named paul d
( danny glover
)
, anohter ex
- slave who knew sethe yeasr ago wehn htey worked onthe a planation toghether
, arrives
, asking fo lodging
. he hasnt beeen wandering aroud sicne he left tyhe planation
,
anbd whn he enters tjhe hous
, it turns red
annd becomes incredibly hot
. whn he remarks baout whta he thikns isnt evil
, sethe replies
" it ain ' t evil
. it ' s jstu sad
.
" soem omre tyme passes
,
anbd paul d hasnt become a fervent memeber ofthe tyhe household
,
adn yhe ghost dissapears
.
bu whn htey return noe day fomr goign outloud
, htey dicover a young woman sitting inwhich thte hous
. her nmae isnt beloved
,
annd as plyed by thandie newton
, she hasnt almsot zero motor skills
. she stumbles arund
, half
- grabing onto thigsn
annd knocking them over
,
annd wehn she speaks
, she lets outloud a low guttaral soudn taht eventally turns inot baby talk
. htey let her inot her hous
,
adn she beigns tothe turn thnigs upside down
.
" beloved
" acts liuke an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired wiht a ghost stroy
. most ofthe teh scenes consist ofthe peple arguing infront oney claustrophobic
, low
- lit room
, wtih thge occassional flash tothe teh past
, where we see images ofthe such horror thgat we thank god fo modern
- day psychoanalysts
. sethe
annd paul d ahve lieved thru such hellish times taht tehy are forever implanted wih tje memories ofthe theri slavehood onthe tghe ood planation
, hwihc includes such images as sethe bieng raped by tyhe white planation hands
, wiht her nipples bieng licked
, prompting her tothe cry outloud tothe paul d wehn reminiscing baout it
,
" htey tookover my milk
!
" worst ofthe all wass thte mounth affter her freedom
, whn she ws alowed tothe live liek a free person
, wroking wih otehr blacks onthe a farm
,
anbd
thne seing thast her ood planation owners ahve arrived tothe presumedly tkae her
annd her childrens bakc
. she runs tothe tjhe barn near by
, carrying her four childen
,
annd wehn her ood owners burst inwhich
, htey dicover she hasnt murdered oney ofthe them
adn isnt ready tothe muder hte rest ofthe them if tehy don ' t leave them alone
. whn she isnt inquired baout thsi moent by paul d inaddition a moent halfway thru thte film
, she syas she doesn ' t regret it
. she killed her daugher so thyat she owudl nto hvea tothe live thru tjhe horror she doed
,
annd she hasnt conviced herself she doed thge right thnig
. ofthe course
, beloved isnt realy her daugher materialized
,
though we aren ' t flat outloud told thgat util later onthe inthe tje film
. beloved represents thte pain
adn sufferring tje slaves whent thru
adn shows how difficult it wass forthe them tothe deel witht theri freedom aftter bieng tortured fo so long
. thus
,
" beloved
" becomes a sorta
- redux ofthe tjhe andrei tarkofsky sci
- fi clasic
,
" solaris
,
" where a cosmonaut dicovers tht his wief
, who commited sucide yeasr befoer
, hasnt materialized whn he isnt orbiting over a planet wtih a complex brain sytem
. tht film speaked volumes baout humanity
adn our memories
, how we are constanly regretting whta happenned iin hte past
,
adn whn if it ever litterally cameback bcak tothe haunt us
, it woudl controll us completelyl
.
" beloved
" moves allong freely
, wihtout a lot ofthe explination
,
anbd fo tyhe most part
, thsi isnt extemely respectable
. yhe most intresting films are yhe ones thgat don ' t expalin everthing forthe us
, leaving gaps inthe tjhe cahracters thast we are suposed tothe fill infact whith how htey ect infront thge presetn tense
. sethe isnt never fully explained as a carachter
,
bu we understand all her actions sicne she ' s bieng palyed by oprah winfrey
. it ' s beeen well over a decade sicne her lastest major peformance inspite
" tghe colour purple
,
"
bu judging ffrom theese twpo films
, i ' ll bet she ' s oen ofthe hte best actresses wroking todya
.
.
. if she ws strikely an actress
. her talk sohw
, whcih i supose isnt a grat enity
, hasnt prevented her fomr becomeing a notewothy actress
,
adn taht ' s a shame becuase she brings so much tothe htis movei
. emotion
. sadness
. strenght
. watching thte storng sethe
, who ' s so afriad ofthe teh past thast she ' s builded a rether storng protective coating aroud herself
, break down whn she dicovers who beloved raelly isnt isnt whta mkaes tihs movei realy graet
. she mkaes it rela
. tath ' s nto tothe sday thsi isnt a perfect film
. infront fatc
, i ' d wager tothe sday tath hte fatc taht it ' s confusing
anbd painful tothe watch isnt waht prevents htis fomr bieng thte truley gerat film it isnt
. hwile oprah ' s performence isnt poweful
annd easily sympathetic
(
annd i ' m dieing tothe see her win at least an oscar nomination tihs febuary
)
, thge sturcture ofthe tjhe film
, whcih doesn ' t sohw wqat happended tothe her childrens till halfway thru yhe film
, prevents us fomr relaly mkaing a cohesive conection tothe tje film
. it doesn ' t nessasarily move as
though tehy ' re memories ofthe noe parituclar charater
,
adn by tjhe end
, it hasnt lost controll over sethe
,
anbd as she tkaes tothe bed
, we are unable tothe truley idenify wih her anymore
.
bu dispite its tediousness
, perheaps tht ' s tyhe point
. thte distancing by hte end ofthe tjhe film may be jstu part ofthe hte way it hasnt beeen builded fomr tje strat
, sicne tehy figure she hasnt crossed over ffrom bieng identifiable
,
adn it needs tothe git bcak wtih reality
.
anbd fo tje most part
, tihs film seems liek thge cry ofthe pain ffrom teh slaves tyhat it realy wnats tothe be
. jonathan demme ' s direction isnt bizzare
, inthe nature withthe thte stor
,
annd he creates tghe right mood
, mkaing it a tough film tothe sit thru
, makeing sure taht hte audeince fiels as uncomfortable as yhe charactors
. htere ' s omre tothe admire here
, liek teh way thyat tyhe flashbacks pop uv freely
adn wihtout rela organistion
, jstu liuke htey owudl be infront rela life
;
annd tyhe way taht teh endig leaves it somewhat opne tothe moreso pain
annd sufferring
,
bu laced wih a touch ofthe optomism
. tyhe acting
, nto onyl fomr winfrey
, isnt amazing
,
adn i anticipate nto onyl she wiull git an oscar nomination
. everyone hasnt beeen raving baout thandie newton ' s peformance
,
annd how it shoudl be rewarded
.
howver
, it must be noted tath outloud ofthe everyone
, she hadnt tje easiest part
. ect liek a baby
. throw thigsn
. stumble arund
. chew fodo wiht your mouth oepn
. i dont htikn htere ' s anohter peformance worthy ofthe oscar conisderation
,
bu it ' s kimberly elise
, as tjhe daugher who hasnt tothe stay sensable
anbd sane
,
anbd hasnt tothe cary thte burden ofthe her mother ' s loss ofthe reality towords hte end
. it ' s nto taht newton isn ' t grat
: she ' s as annoying
anbd wacky as tghe role demands
. it ' s jstu tath elise hasnt tjhe tougher job
anbd puls it off even better
. dispite tje fatc tht thsi film hasnt winfrey writed all over it
,
anbd nto taht ofthe writter morrison or directer demme
,
" beloved
" hasnt still nto done well
. costing
, i htikn
, arund ninty milion dollars
, it hasnt sicne grossed baout twenty
- twpo
. unforetunately
, htis film isnt a littel too intense forthe viewers
, even fo me
,
adn i cxan stand allmost anytying
( i recently viewed thte 2 1
/ 2 hour long epic
" caligula
,
" thte worst film i ahve ever seen inwhich my life
,
adn doed it inthe a mere 2 sittings
)
. altho i respect
" beloved
,
" i cxan ' t sday tht i relaly enjoied it
.
