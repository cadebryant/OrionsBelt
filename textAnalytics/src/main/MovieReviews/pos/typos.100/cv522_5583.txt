. it ' s nto jstu a witty
, funny summing uv ofthe tghe film ' s themes
- ytou might nto guess it
yot
,
bu it sets tjhe pattern fo hte way teh storey goes onthe
. waht starts outloud as a step inthe a fairly sensable direction
, gets taked onthe a road trip
, put thru a detour or twpo
anbd finds itself freewheeling towords an immin ent kresh
. thast may nto soudn so differant fomr tje averege familiy sitcom
,
annd tghe genaral idae ofthe teh film doesn ' t
, at frist
, seem so wildly distant ffrom standart
