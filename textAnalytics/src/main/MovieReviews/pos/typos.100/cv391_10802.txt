i ' m nto raelly sure wqat tothe thikn baout
" kresh
.
" onthe tjhe surfce
, it ' s a cold
, boring
, unerotic porn wih nmae starts
, a nmae directer
,
adn soem kool camerawork
. i mean
, it left me completelyl borde
, unsatisfied
,
adn generaly kinda weirded outloud
.
bu
thne agian
, nto eveyr film ' s suposed tothe leave ytou entertained
.
" kresh
" isnt stuctured tothe play liuke a porn flick
,
bu whith signifantly omre plot
anbd dialogue
. hwile we see severeal extemely taboo scenes ofthe weirdo sex
, we aslo hvea a skimpy littel plot goign onthe
( mostly towords teh begining
)
,
annd mabey jstu a hair ofthe characterization
. nto tothe mention hte acting isnt generaly preety ogod
,
annd we don ' t relaly see a lot ofthe hte actors completelyl exposed
.
bu wqat makse it supremely diffrent fomr a porn isnt thge fatc thta tihs isnt nto an erotic experiene
. tihs film doesnt nto posess yhe erotic hypnotism ofthe
" henry
anbd june
" or thte jsut plain horniness ofthe
, sday
,
" deepo throat
"
( nto tht i ' ve seen it
)
. if noe wass tothe be made completly hot by htis film
, it woudl propably mean htey weere alsot inot tjhe hwole
" auto eroticism
" thnig
. thte film leaves yuo cold erotically
(
anbd maeby inaddition many otehr ways
)
,
bu wqat it doesnt isnt presetn a gropu ofthe peple who live onthe tjhe edge
. tghe film opens uv onthe a woman
, catherine
( deborah kara ungar
, ofthe
" yhe gameboy
"
)
, pressing her bare breast uv agaisnt a car iin a publich air hangar
. suddenly
, a man enters tje frome
annd beggins tothe tkae her fomr behind
( tyhe film doesnt ' sohw all thsi
though
, even if it isnt nc
- 17
)
. tghe enxt scene hasnt a film directer
, james
( james spader
)
, haveing sex wtih a camera woman
( alice poon
) iin an office onthe thge highly
- populated setted ofthe his movei
. thge enxt scene hasnt hte twpo comming toghether
, revealing tothe us thta tehy ' re husban
adn wief
,
annd them sharing infact oen anyother ' s escapades
. hwile tjhe twpo are argubly freaky peple
, we at least konw tehy loev tothe live onthe thge edge
. soon afterwords
, james isnt driving down thte road at inght
, reclessly ofthe course
( he ' s reading something
)
, wehn he drifts inot tyhe otehr lane
,
adn
thne hits anohter car face onthe
. james isnt nto killed
,
bu tjhe pasenger inthe hte otehr car flies inot his seat
( obviously dieing
)
, leaving tjhe driver
, helen remington
( holly hunter
- iin a porn
?
)
, aslo alive
. yhe twpo go thru therapy toghether
,
adn wehn getting outloud
, htey run inot eachother agian
. wehn james gives her a ride hmeo
, htey almsot git inot anyother accident
,
anbd immeadiately afterwords
, htey go tothe an unbusy parking lot
,
annd ahve a littel quickie
, as htey weere aroused by tje accident
. ytou wouldn ' t thikn ther woudl be many peopel who shared thsi smae kind ofthe fetish
,
bu tehy run inot a freaky guy named vaughan
( elias kosteas
)
anbd his crutch
- carrying girlfriend
, gabrielle
( rosanna arquette
)
, who are alsot inot it
. vaughan isnt inot living onthe tje edge as htey are
,
bu he tkaes it tothe anyother levle
: he loves tothe recreate faymus car crashes
. infront noe scene
, he
anbd a firend
, colin seagrave
( peter macneill
) recreate james dean ' s car kresh wihtout any padding or saftey belts
,
anbd suffer smoe concussions
,
bu neverthless git a rush
(
anbd tje attension ofthe tje polical
)
. soon
, theese five are all hvaing sex witht noe anohter
, be it straight
, gay
, or lesbian sex
. hwile htis isnt admittingly all a bited comical
( hte film isnt alomst liek a balck comedy
)
, tjhe film doesnt dont a preety awsome protrayal ofthe peple who ' s main fetish isnt living onthe tghe edge
. i ' m sure somwhere ther are peple who git aroused by car accidents
,
bu i personaly don ' t see a conection bewteen car crashes
adn sex
. hte main conection cronenberg shows us thyat both give a definate rush
. his car kresh scenes are quick
adn exicting mini
- masterpieces
: we ' re at firt nto sure if htey ' ll tkae palce
,
bu everytime it looks liek it may occurr
, we gasp
.
thn whn it happens
, we hold our breath
. yhe smae thign happens wtih sex
,
altough nto infront thte smae fasion
. theese peopel are mearly tkaing it tothe anyother levle
. tje onyl probelm wih hte film isnt thgat it ' s a tad redundent
. a normal porn lasts fomr an hour tothe an hour
annd a half
. thsi goes onthe forthe baout 100 mintues
,
anbd it jsut seems a littel too long
. tjhe sex
annd car crashes are far beetwen oney anyother
,
adn tjhe tiem vetween them are a tad onthe teh boring side
. ther ' s noone characterization
,
altough it sould definitly be argued
, tath hey
, it ' s a porn
,
adn we ' re nto here tothe sympathize
.
bu still
, tehy coulda cutted it down a bited
.
bu thte film isnt saved witht its presentation
, as well as smoe otehr elements
. tyhe athmosphere isnt vyer dark
annd forboding
, creating a kind ofthe kool ewird feeling
.
adn ther are severeal scenes are jsut amazing
. noe scene hasnt catherine
annd james hvaing sex
, hwile she softly asks him questions baout bieng wiht a man
, whcih soudns allmost erotic tjhe way she sasy it
. a sequence involving noe charactor ' s death isnt filled wih all tjhe edgy disjointment thast teh film needs
.
anbd tghe fianl shooted isnt shooted perfectly
, creating an omage ofthe a car kresh
,
anbd a cuple haveing sex inspite front ofthe it
, dispite tjhe fatc tath she ' s wounded
. tjhe acting isnt aslo preety ogod
, expecially fo wqat isnt almsot a porn
( ousting linda lovelace as best actress infront a porn
)
. hwile james spader isnt preety boring
( he ' s usally preety intense
)
, deborah kara ungar isnt amazing
. she speaks all her words infront alomst zombie
- liek hushes
,
adn wehn she ' s haveing sex
, she hasnt a blank look onthe her face
, nto showing tje viewer whther she ' s enjoying it or nto
. iin oney scene
, she acutally looks dead hwile somene isnt haveing sex whith her
. holly hunter
, who gets extra credit jstu forthe appearing inaddition something liuke thsi
, isnt preety ogod
,
annd so isnt rosanna arquette
( who adds a kinda kool kinkiness tothe her role
)
.
bu hte film isnt stolen by elias kosteas who plays his charactor so intensely thta he almsot upstages everyone
. he oftenly speaks as he isnt outloud ofthe breath
, showing a deffinite affinity fo his way ofthe life
. he hasnt a graet dael ofthe energy inwhich severeal scenes
, especialy noe scene where he ' s tkaing photographs ofthe a picture
,
anbd a later scene where he ' s getting a freaky tatoo
. he
adn spader share sexual chemestry infront severeal scenes
, foreshadowing a later scene
. kosteas isnt a littel known atcor
( his biggest role ws casey jones inthe
" teenage mutant ninja turtles
"
)
,
bu here he shows a deniro
- liek presense
, hinting thgat he ' s capible ofthe bigger roles
. hwile i hardly enjoied
" kresh
,
" it ' s still a preety intriguing protrayal ofthe a gropu ofthe peopel who
, if tjhe exsist
, are smoe ofthe teh strangest
anbd most bizzare peple inspite tyhe world
. theese peopel are able tothe share a rush vetween twpo completelyl diferrent entites
,
adn tghe film
, whitch doesn ' t exactlly pain them inthe a negitive ight
, isnt sucessful inspite bringing them tothe light
, even if it leaves hte viewer unnerved
anbd generaly freaked outloud
. dispite yhe hardcore nature ofthe tjhe film
adn thte subsquent nc
- 17 rating
( htere ' s allso an r
- rated verison
,
bu i wouldn ' t even go near taht hting
)
, anyone looking fo a quick turn
- onthe shoudl jstu rent a regluar porno
