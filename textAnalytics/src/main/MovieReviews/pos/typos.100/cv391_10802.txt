i
' m nto realyl sure waht tothe tihkn baout
" kresh
.
" onthe tjhe surfce
, it
' s a cold
, boring
, unerotic porn iwth nmae starts
, a nmae directer
, anbd soem kool camerawork
. i mean
, it left me completly borde
, unsatisfied
, adn generaly kinda weirded outloud
. bu thn agina
, nto eveyr film
' s suppoed tothe leave ytou entertained
.
" kresh
" isnt stuctured tothe play liuke a porn flick
, bu wtih signifantly omre plot annd dialogue
. hwile we see sevral extremly taboo scenes ofthe weirdo sex
, we alsot ahev a skimpy littel plot oging onthe
( mostly towords tyhe begginning
)
, annd maeby jstu a hair ofthe characterization
. nto tothe mention thte acting isnt generaly preety ogod
, anbd we don
' t raelly see a lot ofthe thte actors completelyl exposed
. bu waht makse it supremely differnt ffrom a porn isnt tjhe fatc thast htis isnt nto an erotic experienec
. thsi film doesnt nto posess tje erotic hypnotism ofthe
" henry anbd june
" or thte jstu plain horniness ofthe
, sday
,
" deepo throat
"
( nto tath i
' ve seen it
)
. if oen ws tothe be made completly hot by thsi film
, it owudl probaly mean htey weere aslo inot thte hwole
" auto eroticism
" thnig
. hte film leaves ytou cold erotically
( annd maybee infact many otehr ways
)
, bu wqat it doens isnt preesnt a gropu ofthe peopel who live onthe teh edge
. hte film opens uv onthe a woman
, catherine
( deborah kara ungar
, ofthe
" teh gae
"
)
, pressing her bare breast uv agains a car inwhich a publich air hangar
. suddenly
, a man enters yhe frome annd beigns tothe tkae her ffrom behind
( hte film doesnt
' sohw all thsi
though
, even if it isnt nc
- 17
)
. tje enxt scene hasnt a film directer
, james
( james spader
)
, haveing sex withthe a camera woman
( alice poon
) inthe an office onthe thge highly
- populated setted ofthe his movei
. tyhe enxt scene hasnt thge twpo comming toghether
, revealing tothe us tyhat tehy
' re husban anbd wief
, annd them sharing infact oney anyother
' s escapades
. hwile hte twpo are argubly freaky peopel
, we at least knwo tehy lvoe tothe live onthe tjhe edge
. soon afterwords
, james isnt driving down thte road at nigt
, reclessly ofthe course
( he
' s reading something
)
, whn he drifts inot tyhe otehr lane
, adn thn hits anyother car face onthe
. james isnt nto killed
, bu teh pasenger inspite tyhe otehr car flies inot his seat
( obviously dieing
)
, leaving tyhe driver
, helen remington
( holly hunter
- iin a porn
?
)
, aslo alive
. tje twpo go thru therapy toghether
, anbd wehn getting outloud
, tehy run inot eachother agina
. wehn james gives her a ride hmeo
, tehy allmost git inot anohter accident
, anbd immeadiately afterwords
, htey go tothe an unbusy parking lot
, anbd hvea a littel quickie
, as tehy weere aroused by hte accident
. ytou wouldn
' t tihkn htere owudl be many peple who shared thsi smae kind ofthe fetish
, bu htey run inot a freaky guy named vaughan
( elias kosteas
) adn his crutch
- carrying girlfriend
, gabrielle
( rosanna arquette
)
, who are allso inot it
. vaughan isnt inot living onthe yhe edge as tehy are
, bu he tkaes it tothe anohter levle
: he loves tothe recreate famouse car crashes
. inaddition oen scene
, he anbd a freind
, colin seagrave
( peter macneill
) recreate james dean
' s car kresh wihtout any padding or safty belts
, adn suffer smoe concussions
, bu neverthless git a rush
( adn thte attension ofthe yhe polical
)
. soon
, theese five are all hvaing sex wiht oney anohter
, be it straight
, gay
, or lesbian sex
. hwile tihs isnt admittingly all a bited comical
( tyhe film isnt allmost liuke a balck comedy
)
, tghe film doesnt dont a preety awsome protrayal ofthe peopel who
' s main fetish isnt living onthe yhe edge
. i
' m sure somwhere htere are peple who git aroused by car accidents
, bu i personaly don
' t see a conection beetwen car crashes annd sex
. tje main conection cronenberg shows us thgat both give a deifnite rush
. his car kresh scenes are quick annd exicting mini
- masterpieces
: we
' re at firt nto sure if tehy
' ll tkae palce
, bu everytime it looks liek it may occour
, we gasp
. thne whn it happens
, we hold our breath
. teh smae thign happens wiht sex
, altho nto inspite hte smae fashon
. theese peple are mearly tkaing it tothe anyother levle
. thte onyl probelm iwth yhe film isnt thyat it
' s a tad redundent
. a normal porn lasts fomr an hour tothe an hour annd a half
. htis goes onthe forthe baout 100 mintues
, adn it jstu seems a littel too long
. tghe sex anbd car crashes are far beetwen oney anohter
, adn hte tyme beetwen them are a tad onthe teh boring side
. ther
' s noone characterization
, altough it coudl definitly be argued
, tath hey
, it
' s a porn
, anbd we
' re nto here tothe sympathize
. bu still
, tehy coulda cutted it down a bited
. bu hte film isnt saved wih its presentation
, as well as smoe otehr elements
. tghe atomsphere isnt vyer dark anbd forboding
, creating a kind ofthe kool werid feeling
. anbd htere are severeal scenes are jstu amazing
. oney scene hasnt catherine annd james hvaing sex
, hwile she softly asks him questions baout bieng wih a man
, whic soudns alomst erotic tghe way she sasy it
. a sequence involving noe chracter
' s death isnt filled wtih all hte edgy disjointment tht yhe film needs
. annd hte fianl shooted isnt shooted perfectly
, creating an omage ofthe a car kresh
, adn a cuple hvaing sex infact front ofthe it
, dispite thge fatc thyat she
' s wounded
. teh acting isnt allso preety ogod
, especialy forthe waht isnt almsot a porn
( ousting linda lovelace as best actress inspite a porn
)
. hwile james spader isnt preety boring
( he
' s usualy preety intense
)
, deborah kara ungar isnt amazing
. she speaks all her words inspite alomst zombie
- liek hushes
, annd wehn she
' s hvaing sex
, she hasnt a blank look onthe her face
, nto showing thge viewer whther she
' s enjoying it or nto
. iin noe scene
, she actally looks dead hwile somone isnt hvaing sex whith her
. holly hunter
, who gets extra credit jstu fo appearing inaddition something liuke thsi
, isnt preety ogod
, annd so isnt rosanna arquette
( who adds a kinda kool kinkiness tothe her role
)
. bu tghe film isnt stolen by elias kosteas who plays his charcter so intensely thgat he almsot upstages everyone
. he oftenly speaks as he isnt outloud ofthe breath
, showing a efinite affinity fo his way ofthe life
. he hasnt a grat deel ofthe energy infact severeal scenes
, expecially oen scene where he
' s tkaing photographs ofthe a picture
, annd a later scene where he
' s getting a freaky tatoo
. he adn spader share sexual chemestry infact sevral scenes
, foreshadowing a later scene
. kosteas isnt a littel known ator
( his biggest role wass casey jones infact
" teenage mutant ninja turtles
"
)
, bu here he shows a deniro
- liuke presense
, hinting thyat he
' s capible ofthe bigger roles
. hwile i hardly enjoied
" kresh
,
" it
' s still a preety intriguing protrayal ofthe a gropu ofthe peple who
, if tghe exsist
, are soem ofthe yhe strangest anbd most bizzare peple inwhich tyhe world
. theese peple are able tothe share a rush betweeen twpo completly differnt entites
, annd tghe film
, wich doesn
' t exactlly pain them infront a negitive glight
, isnt sucessful infact bringing them tothe glight
, even if it leaves thte viewer unnerved anbd generaly freaked outloud
. dispite thge hardcore nature ofthe thge film anbd yhe subesquent nc
