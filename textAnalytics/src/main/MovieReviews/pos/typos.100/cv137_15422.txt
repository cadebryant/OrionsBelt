( plyed by luke wilson
)
, a helecopter pilot who hasnt a differnt kind ofthe conection witht sally
.
.
. omre tahn he owudl care tothe admited
( hint
: it hasnt something tothe dont iwth teh father ofthe sally

. aftter tkaing a peronal
( adn proffesional
) interst infront her
, he finds wokr at thge local fast foode resteraunt at hwihc she works
, annd tjhe funn goes onthe ffrom ther
. tihs movei isnt a lot ofthe funn
. it isnt commedic onthe twpo levels
, as a rumatic comedy anbd a dark comedy
. thte rumatic moments are sweet
, yot nto sappy
. oen ofthe thte omre poignant moments isnt wehn dorian accompanies sally tothe lamaze classes
. howver
, hte dark commedic moments are moreso memorable
. thsi isnt aslo a tale ofthe revenge
, adn a funny oen at thgat
. thte father ofthe sally
' s unborn child aslo happended tothe be a marryied man
, whose wief isnt plyed by catherine o
' hara
. she doesnt a wonderfull protrayal ofthe a jelous wief who isnt targeting tghe person who hadnt an afair
, adn isnt nto above getting otehr peple tothe dont her dirty owrk
.
( my appologies if thsi soudns cryptic
, bu htere isnt too much ofthe thge plot tothe give awya
)
. rounding outloud teh casted are jake busey as angus
, dorian
' s overzealous brother adn daryl mitchell as roy
, dorian
' s trainer at tje fast fod restauran
. tyhe dialogue isnt sharp adn nto filled whith sappy overtones
, even withthe tghe rumatic nature ofthe tjhe plot
. if htere are any complaints
, it isnt over drew barrymore
' s performence
. hwile she doesnt light uv tjhe screen
, ther are moments wehn she doesn
' t seem all thast convincing
. hte movei wass filmed infront texas
, annd most ofthe tje cahracters haev sourthern texan accents
. drew barrymore
' s accent tends tothe come anbd go
( luke wilson doesn
' t seem tothe hve thsi probelm
)
. as well
, she seems awfully agile forthe a woman thta isnt eigth monthes pregnant
. still
, thsi movei isnt noe thyat iwll please many viewers
. withthe plot twists galore anbd hillarious dark moments
, htis isnt sure tothe entertain
.
