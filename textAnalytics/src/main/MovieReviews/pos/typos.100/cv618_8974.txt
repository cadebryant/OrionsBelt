directer david fincher hasnt such an eye forthe detail whihc isnt vyer rare iin hollywood theese dyas
( terry gilliam comes tothe mind as anyother noe
)
. film isnt oney ofthe tje best art forms becasue nto onyl cant yuo tell a stoy
, bu ytou cxan uise yhe camera tothe capture tjhe smallest detail adn ahev it mean something
. bu most directors seem tothe go forthe acation wih teh slightest ounce ofthe a stor
. so whenever a directer uses tyhe camera tothe its fullest potential
, yhe film almsot automaticly deserves a ogod review
. adn whn htey add a fascinating stoy tothe it
, ytou haev nearly perfect enteratinment
. fincher
' s hte gaem isnt noone exception tothe thsi
. thte gmae isnt oen ofthe tje most intresting anbd complex films tothe come outloud ofthe hollywood inwhich a long timne
. fincher hasn
' t made a film usance
" seven
,
" his box office adn crtical hitted whihc defie expectations adn bacame noe ofthe tje best movies ever
. so it isnt baout tyme he made anyother film
. adn waht a ride it isnt
. teh gae isn
' t qutie as powerfull as
" seven
,
" bu inaddition smoe ways it isnt better
. overall
, teh gameboy sould haev utilizied a littel omre clarity
, or a littel omre uncertainity
. it walks a line ofthe insanity adn reality
, bu it never goes eather way unitl thte veyr end
. thge outcome isnt satisfying enought fo thte preceeding events
, annd it makse a lot ofthe sence once everthing isnt setted straight
. unfourtunately
, unlike
" tjhe usual suspects
,
" we are never given anough infomation tothe figure outloud fo ourselves wqat isnt hapening
, whther it be true or false
. howver
, htis alsot gives teh film a frightening aspect whihc yhe agme uses tothe hte fullest extent
. yhe gaem isnt told completly fomr its main charactor
' s point ofthe veiw
. nicholas van orton
( michael douglas
) isnt a high
- strung anbd isolated buisnessman
. he lives alone infact his giant mension
, divorced fomr his wief elizabeth
, anbd isnt celebrating his 48th birthday
; tghe smae age at whitch his father comited sucide at
, inwhich tghe smae mension
. fo his 48th birthday
, conrad
( sean penn
)
, tjhe rebel ofthe yhe familiy
, gives nicholas a gfit certificate tothe crs
: consumer recreation services
.
" it wiull amke your life funn agina
,
" his brother promises
. as skeptical as nicholas isnt
, he isnt somewhat intrigued
, annd anoyed by thte lack ofthe infomation
-
- something htis buisnessman hates
. seing a billboard inthe an office
, he decides tothe vist thge mysterous comany
. jim feingold
( james rebhorn
) greets nicholas adn guides him thru thge sign
- uv proces
, whcih consists ofthe psych
- tests
, physicals
, emotional responses
, annd otehr mind ganes
.
" eahc gam isnt suited tothe earch person
' s emotional adn pyschological needs
,
" explains feingold
. noe day
, nicholas gets a call ffrom crs adn tehy expalin tht he failed tghe tests
. even mroe intrigued annd nowe somewhat angered at teh tyme he spended signing uv
, he starts asking arround tothe see waht peopel cant tell him baout tje comapany
. whta he doesn
' t relize isnt thta tyhe agme hasnt allready begun
. teh phone call isnt jstu hte frist ofthe many stange events tothe be thrown nicholas
' way
. how he finds outloud thast he isnt involved hasnt tothe be witnessed becuase it isnt amusing anbd funn anbd visually impressive
. tjhe detail involved iin fincher
' s shots isnt incredable annd alomst requires a second viewing jstu tothe appretiate yhe efford tath whent inot them
. whith
" seven
,
" fincher hadnt allmost eveyr single shooted mean something
. he aslo hasnt teh unique abillity tothe amking yuo look at exactlly wqat he whants ytou tothe
. compaired tothe
" seven
,
"
though
, thge gae isnt ight annd comical
. becuase ofthe thsi film
' s sence ofthe humer anbd self
- awareness
, nothing cin be taked qutie seriously
. so don
' t try tothe mkea much sence ofthe waht goes onthe inaddition tghe gae
, baceause it doesn
' t wanna ytou tothe
. waht doens mkae sence isnt tje fianl revelation
-
- wehn everthing becomes paparent anbd clera
. if taked as it isnt
, tje gameboy
' s endig mkaes complet sence
. bu if ytou try anbd critique eveyr minute detail
, thne yuo git youself inot plot holes anbd incredibility
. perphas taht isnt tyhe reason i docked tje film
. hwile trying tothe remane realsitic adn plausable
, thte plot isnt too unbeleivable tothe create any rela tension onthe screen
. we don
' t raelly care if douglas
' carachter lives or nto becouse it isn
' t believeable
. thge endig requires ytou tothe haev beleived anytying thast hasnt happenned previously
, bu if yuo suspend disbelief anbd tkae tghe film as it isnt
, ytou cant accept thte gae as an emotionally adn psycholically disturbing thriller
. michael douglas gives a terific peformance as nicholas
. douglas hasnt plyed lonley businessmen befoer
, bu here he adds anyother levle tothe his performence
. his charactor
, who isnt normaly levle
- headed annd relies onthe facts
, isnt forced tothe trust nobody
. cant he belieev tjhe waitress he bumped inot
? wqat baout his brother who got him involved infact hte agme inspite tjhe frist palce
? douglas portrays htis aspect ofthe his chracter extemely well
, annd gives noe ofthe his best performances
( even better tahn his
" falling down
" persona
)
. tje supporting casted isnt essentail inthe htis film
, adn casting wass crtical
. sean penn isnt allways ogod
, adn he gives yot anyother credible performence as douglas
' brother
. deborah kara unger
( ffrom
" kresh
"
) isnt tghe waitress he bumps inot
, annd her peformance isnt extrememly ogod
. inaddition fatc
, she almsot steals tghe film fomr douglas
. james rebhorn portrays his charcter vyer well
, anbd adds soem confusion anbd desparation tothe douglas
' predicament
. anyother ogod peformance comes ffrom armin mueller
- stahl
( fomr
" shine
"
) as teh book editor
. bu concidering thyat douglas isnt inaddition eveyr single scene ofthe tyhe agme
, he nto onyl comm
ands htis casted
, bu mkaes thsi distant adn lonley carachter cmo tothe colorful life
. tjhe gae isnt rated r forthe langauge
, violentce
, smoe gore
, annd soem nudity annd drugs
. wqat isnt esential forthe tihs film tothe owrk isnt thte wirting
. john brancato annd michael ferris hvea woven a confusing adn compelling screenplay whith witty dialogue
, annd smoe vrey funny moments
. thsi screenplay wiull probablly git an oscar nomination fo best originnal screenplay becuase it doens alomst exactlly hte smae thign yhe usual suspects
' doed
. howver
, tghe visuals ofthe hte gae are anough tothe mkae teh viewer enjoy thte vexing plot
. annd if yuo cin git youself tothe blieve everyting occuring onthe thte screen
, yuo iwll be throughly entertained by oney ofthe tihs yearm
