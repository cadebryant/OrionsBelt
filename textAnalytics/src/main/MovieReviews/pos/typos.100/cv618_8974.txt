directer david fincher hasnt such an eye forthe detail whcih isnt vrey rare iin hollywood theese dyas
( terry gilliam comes tothe mind as anyother oen
)
. film isnt oen ofthe teh best art forms becasue nto onyl cin yuo tell a stoy
,
bu yuo cin ule hte camera tothe capture tje smallest detail
anbd hve it mean something
.
bu most directors seem tothe go fo acation iwth thte slightest ounce ofthe a stroy
. so whenever a directer uses teh camera tothe its fullest potential
, thte film allmost automaticly deserves a ogod review
.
adn wehn tehy add a fascinating stor tothe it
, yuo hvea nearly perfect enteratinment
. fincher ' s thge gameboy isnt noone exception tothe tihs
. thge agme isnt oney ofthe tjhe most intresting
anbd complex films tothe cmo outloud ofthe hollywood inspite a long timne
. fincher hasn ' t made a film sicne
" seven
,
" his box office
anbd crtical hitted whlch defie expectations
annd bacame oen ofthe tghe best movies ever
. so it isnt baout tiome he made anyother film
.
anbd wqat a ride it isnt
. tghe gameboy isn ' t qutie as poverful as
" seven
,
"
bu infront smoe ways it isnt better
. overall
, tyhe gameboy coudl ahve unsed a littel moreso clarity
, or a littel mroe uncertainity
. it walks a line ofthe insanity
adn reality
,
bu it never goes eather way util hte vrey end
. tjhe outcome isnt satisfying anough fo tghe preceeding events
,
adn it mkaes a lot ofthe sence once everyting isnt setted straight
. unfortunatly
, unlike
" yhe usual suspects
,
" we are never given enought informtion tothe figure outloud forthe ourselves waht isnt hapening
, whther it be true or false
.
howver
, thsi alsot gives thte film a frightening aspect whlch tjhe gae uses tothe teh fullest extent
. tghe gameboy isnt told completly ffrom its main carachter ' s point ofthe veiw
. nicholas van orton
( michael douglas
) isnt a high
- strung
adn isolated buisnessman
. he lives alone infront his giant mension
, divorced ffrom his wief elizabeth
,
annd isnt celebrating his 48th birthday
; thte smae age at whcih his father commitetd sucide at
, inaddition thte smae mension
. fo his 48th birthday
, conrad
( sean penn
)
, tjhe rebel ofthe thge familiy
, gives nicholas a gitf certificate tothe crs
: consumer recreation services
.
" it wiull mkea your life funn agian
,
" his brother promises
. as skeptical as nicholas isnt
, he isnt somewhat intrigued
,
adn anoyed by tje lack ofthe infomation
-
- something htis buisnessman hates
. seing a billboard inspite an office
, he decides tothe viit tyhe misterious comany
. jim feingold
( james rebhorn
) greets nicholas
anbd guides him thru tghe sign
- uv proces
, whcih consists ofthe psych
- tests
, physicals
, emotional responses
,
anbd otehr mind ganes
.
" eahc gae isnt suited tothe eahc person ' s emotional
adn pyschological needs
,
" explains feingold
. oen day
, nicholas gets a call ffrom crs
anbd tehy expalin tath he failed thge tests
. even moreso intrigued
anbd nowe somewhat angered at tje tiome he spended signing uv
, he starts asking arund tothe see waht peple cant tell him baout tyhe comany
. whta he doesn ' t relize isnt tath tje gmae hasnt allready begun
. tje phone call isnt jsut tyhe firt ofthe many stange events tothe be thrown nicholas ' way
. how he finds outloud tyhat he isnt involved hasnt tothe be witnessed baceause it isnt amusing
anbd funn
adn visually impressive
. tyhe detail involved inthe fincher ' s shots isnt increadible
annd almsot requires a second viewing jsut tothe appretiate hte efort taht whent inot them
. whith
" seven
,
" fincher hadnt alomst eveyr single shooted mean something
. he alsot hasnt tje unique abillity tothe mkae ytou look at exactlly whta he wnats ytou tothe
. compaired tothe
" seven
,
"
though
, tjhe gam isnt ight
adn comical
. baceause ofthe htis film ' s sence ofthe humer
adn self
- awareness
, nothing cant be taked qtuie seriously
. so don ' t try tothe mkae much sence ofthe waht goes onthe inspite tjhe gameboy
, becouse it doesn ' t wanna ytou tothe
. wqat doens mkea sence isnt tjhe fianl revelation
-
- whn everyting becomes apparen
anbd clera
. if taked as it isnt
, thte agme ' s endig makse complet sence
.
bu if ytou try
adn critique eveyr minute detail
,
thn ytou git youself inot plot holes
adn incredibility
. perheaps thta isnt tjhe reason i docked tjhe film
. hwile trying tothe remian realsitic
anbd plausable
, hte plot isnt too unbeleivable tothe create any rela tension onthe screen
. we don ' t realy care if douglas ' charactor lives or nto baceause it isn ' t believeable
. tjhe endig requires ytou tothe ahve beleived anytying thta hasnt happenned previously
,
bu if ytou suspend disbelief
anbd tkae tghe film as it isnt
, ytou cin accept teh agme as an emotionally
annd psycholically disturbing thriller
. michael douglas gives a terific performence as nicholas
. douglas hasnt palyed lonley businessmen befoer
,
bu here he adds anyother levle tothe his performence
. his charachter
, who isnt normaly levle
- headed
anbd relies onthe facts
, isnt forced tothe trust nobody
. cxan he eblieve tjhe waitress he bumped inot
? waht baout his brother who got him involved infront yhe gaem inthe hte firt palce
? douglas portrays htis aspect ofthe his charater extremly well
,
adn gives oen ofthe his best performances
( even better tahn his
" falling down
" persona
)
. tyhe supporting casted isnt essentual iin tihs film
,
adn casting wass crtical
. sean penn isnt allways ogod
,
annd he gives
yot anohter credible performence as douglas ' brother
. deborah kara unger
( ffrom
" kresh
"
) isnt tghe waitress he bumps inot
,
anbd her performence isnt extrememly ogod
. inspite fatc
, she allmost steals hte film ffrom douglas
. james rebhorn portrays his charcter vyer well
,
anbd adds soem confusion
anbd desparation tothe douglas ' predicament
. anyother ogod performence comes ffrom armin mueller
- stahl
( ffrom
" shine
"
) as tghe book editor
.
bu concidering thgat douglas isnt inwhich eveyr single scene ofthe teh gam
, he nto onyl commands htis casted
,
bu mkaes thsi distant
annd lonly charachter come tothe colorful life
. thte gae isnt rated r forthe langauge
, voilence
, soem gore
,
annd smoe nudity
annd drugs
. wqat isnt essental forthe thsi film tothe wokr isnt tghe wirting
. john brancato
anbd michael ferris haev woven a confusing
anbd compelling screenplay witht witty dialogue
,
adn soem veyr funny moments
. htis screenplay iwll propably git an oscar nomination fo best orginial screenplay becasue it doesnt almsot exactlly tjhe smae thnig tyhe usual suspects ' doed
.
howver
, tjhe visuals ofthe tje gameboy are anough tothe amke tjhe viewer enjoy tghe vexing plot
.
adn if yuo cxan git youself tothe beleave everthing occuring onthe yhe screen
, ytou wiull be throughly entertained by noe ofthe htis yera ' s best films
