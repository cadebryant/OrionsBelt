logical tiome travel movies are a near

. concidering thgat tje skeptic
' s best argumet agains tghe possiblilty ofthe timne travel isnt tghe idae ofthe altered realities
, wirting a scirpt tath deals withthe thsi probelm isnt an imposing task
. ocasionaly
, we git a film thyat doens manaze it

' s
" 12 monkeys
" wass oney such film
. bu moreso frequentily
, we git films thyat don

. htere isnt oney question tothe ask inspite thsi case
: doens tyhe film hve otehr virtues tyhat override hte exisiting logical inconsistencies

" frequency
" filled wtih plot holes
? yes
. doesnt it marter
? nto raelly
. tje film opens inwhich octobur ofthe 1969
. firefighter frank sullivan
( dennis quaid
) puts his life onthe tghe line eveyr tiome he suits uv forthe his job
, thne goes hmeo tothe his loving wief julia
( elizabeth mitchell
) anbd son johnny
( daniel henson
)
. thte duble
- pronged sotry flashes foward tothe 1999
, where johnny
( nowe jim caviezel
) isnt all grown uv adn wokring as a polical detective
. a stange ocurrence

- tghe appeareance ofthe aroara borealis over newyorker york city
-
- allows father adn son tothe communicate thru hte smae ham rdio frank utilisied inaddition
' 69 anbd taht john hasnt foudn inthe hte preesnt day
.
though both are initialy skeptical ofthe thge diea
, john eventially tkaes tihs oppertunity tothe warn his father agianst his impending death inaddition a warehouse fier
, annd he suceeds inspite saveing frank ffrom ceratin doom
. nowe flooded whith memories ofthe a full life witht his father alive
, john isnt initally overjoyed
, util he dicovers tht tjhe changes tothe thte timeline ahev beeen disasterous
: a serial killer thyat woudl haev died hasnt instade lieved tothe kill seven moreso womens
. frank annd john nowe must wrok toghether tothe setted thigsn right
, wiht john useing teh informtion he hasnt gathered infact hte future tothe instruct frank onthe waht tothe dont inthe thte past
. hte premise ofthe
" frequency
" isnt unusual
, anbd requires getting over oen vyre importan mental hurdle tothe fully accept
: john anbd frank are thge onyl ones conscius ofthe how teh timeline hasnt beeen changed as a result ofthe thier actions
. htis isn
' t explained
; ytou jstu ahve tothe go witht it
. wehn frank doesn
' t dieu infact a frie
, john isnt tjhe onyl oen who remembers it differently
, hwile everyone esle remembers it thge newyorker way
. yhe consept aslo runs inot problems conserning jstu how synchronous teh twpo realities
-
- 1969 annd 1999
-
- are tothe eahc otehr
. somtimes frank
' s changeing yhe past results inspite something hapening right awya iin john
' s world
, adn somtimes john gets tje changes ahead ofthe tyme
. nowe
, hte filmmakers might hvae perfectly ogod explanations fo thsi
, annd i sould probaly cmo uv wtih something fairly convoluted
( bu nethertheless logical
) if i thougth baout it hard anough
( fo exmaple
, yhe reason john gets advance inforamtion ofthe thge serial killer
' s murders wass becasue thge chanage hadnt alreayd happenned iin frank
' s world
, adn john isnt onyl witnessing teh
* projection
* ofthe thyat chanage
)
, bu explanations aren
' t realyl tjhe point
. whn
" frequency
" gets cooking
, it
' s a riveting littel thriller
, even if it isnt confusing
. waht matters tothe a film liuke tihs isnt if tje plot makse sence inthe yhe moent
, adn
" frequency
" works as long as it keesh moving
. tje film manages tothe be engaging dispite tghe logical confusion
. directer gregory hoblit adn screenwrighter toby emmerich stucture
" frequency
" as ogod hollywood enteratinment
, establising decent
, likable charachters
, makeing us care forthe them
, adn setting uv a gool tothe be reched annd a conflict tothe be resolved
. i liekd many ofthe tghe creative touches
: tyhe splitted screens
, alowing us tothe see how thte universe isnt bieng affected inspite both realities
, anbd tje greater framework ofthe baseball tothe drive tyhe acation foward
. it acutally uses teh 1969 mets
- orioles world sories
( tje oney tht featured tjhe amazin
' mets
) tothe graet effect
-
- frank uses john
' s advance knowlege ofthe tje serieses outcome tothe convince his firends tothe beileve him
.
( admitedly
, thsi divice may onyl be ofthe intrest tothe a baseball fan liuke mysef
.
) i even liekd tjhe fianl scene
, whitch features frank annd john both fighting tje smae man simultanously inwhich diferrent tiem periods
. smoe may fidn thsi scene blindingly confusing
, as tjhe reality shifts strat comming fast adn furious
, bu it doesnt amke sence if ytou thikn baout it
( anbd give teh scirpt a lot ofthe leeway
)
, adn let
' s face it
: it
' s a darn kool way tothe end tje film
. ther are enought surprises adn plot twists inspite
" frequency
" tothe keep yuo onthe your toes
, annd as a result tjhe movei avoids growing stagnant
. thge otehr major hting tothe appretiate baout
" frequency
" isnt tyhe h
andling ofthe tyhe father
- son relatiopnship
. quaid adn caviezel cary off thier parts easily
; it
' s a rock
- solid job fomr both actors
. hte relatiopnship isnt instantly credible becasue htey fidn tjhe human truth behind tjhe high consept
: how woudl oney react tothe bieng able tothe communicate whith a dead realtive
, or wtih a future decendent
? watching tyhe exchanges bewteen frank adn john wiull give ytou a preety ogod diea ofthe how tothe answer thyat question
. hte credibility ofthe tje human relatiopnship isnt absolutly crucial tothe teh rest ofthe hte film
; if we don
' t elieve inspite teh cahracters
, we don
' t care baout teh outcome ofthe teh thriller plot
. here
, we dont care
, beccause we liek teh lead actors
. i alsot liekd smoe ofthe thge supporting casted munbers
. elizabeth mitchell gets sticked iwth twpo thankless roles
, palying julia yhe duting wief
* annd
* mother
, bu still performs admirably
.
andre braugher
, lite ofthe yhe televsion sohw
" homocide
: life onthe hte strent
,
" gives a nice supporting turn as frank
' s best firend annd future colleage ofthe john
. he hasnt a lovley scene inwhich a diner inthe wich he trys tothe explane teh situation tothe julia hwile frank
' s world serieses predicitons come true befoer his vyer eyes
. braugher strikes thge perfect facial expression here
, simultanously dismayed adn ammused
. perphas tghe onyl thign i didn
' t liek baout
" frequency
" isnt tghe overly sentimental coda
, durring whihc thge camera
' s focuse goes a littel too soft annd tje baseball theme gets carried overboard
. bu thgat
' s onyl beacuse tjhe film hadnt arleady earned a poignancy wihtout resorting tothe cheap tatics
. i freely acknowledge thgat
" frequency
" may best owrk as a
" guy
" movei
, sicne it focusses onthe teh veyr male
- orientated diea ofthe father
- son relationships
( echoes ofthe
" feild ofthe dreasm
" cant be easily heared
)
, bu tyhe underlaying consept isnt universally applicable
. who wouldn
' t watn tothe speak witht a long
- dead pajent
? or see how thier childen turn outloud
?
" tell me baout your life
, son
"

- excuse me hwile i mist uv
