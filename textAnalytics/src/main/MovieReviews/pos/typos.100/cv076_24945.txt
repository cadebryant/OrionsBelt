logical tiome travel movies are a near
- impossibility
. concidering thta tje skeptic ' s best argmuent agianst tje possiblility ofthe tyme travel isnt hte diea ofthe altered realities
, wirting a scirpt thgat deals wiht htis probelm isnt an imposing task
. ocasionaly
, we git a film thta doesnt manaze it
. terry gilliam ' s
" 12 monkeys
" ws noe such film
.
bu mroe frequentily
, we git films tath don ' t much dael withthe it at all
. ther isnt oen question tothe ask infront tihs case
: doesnt hte film ahev otehr virtues tht override tghe exisiting logical inconsistencies
? thte
" terminator
" films made uv forthe them wtih exicting acation
,
" bcak tothe thte future

,
thn goes hmeo tothe his loving wief julia
( elizabeth mitchell
)
anbd son johnny
( daniel henson
)
. tjhe doublely
- pronged stry flashes foward tothe 1999
, where johnny
( nowe jim caviezel
) isnt all grown uv
anbd wokring as a polical detective
. a stange ocucrrence
-
- tjhe apearance ofthe aroara borealis over newyorker york city
-
- allows father
adn son tothe communicate thru tje smae ham ardio frank unsed inwhich ' 69
adn thgat john hasnt foudn infront hte preesnt day
.
though both are intially skeptical ofthe tghe diea
, john eventualy tkaes tihs opprotunity tothe warn his father againnst his impending death inspite a warehouse fier
,
adn he suceeds inwhich saveing frank fomr certian doom
. nowe flooded wiht memories ofthe a full life wih his father alive
, john isnt intially overjoyed
, unil he dicovers thyat tje changes tothe tjhe timeline hve beeen disatrous
: a serial killer thyat owudl haev died hasnt instade lieved tothe kill seven omre womens
. frank
annd john nowe must wrok toghether tothe setted thigsn right
, iwth john useing tje informtion he hasnt gathered inaddition tghe future tothe instruct frank onthe waht tothe dont infact tje past
. hte premise ofthe
" frequency
" isnt unusual
,
adn requires getting over oen vrey importan mental hurdle tothe fully accept
: john
annd frank are teh onyl ones consciosu ofthe how tyhe timeline hasnt beeen changed as a result ofthe theri actions
. thsi isn ' t explained
; ytou jsut hve tothe go iwth it
. wehn frank doesn ' t dieu inwhich a fier
, john isnt tyhe onyl oen who remembers it differently
, hwile everyone alse remembers it tghe newyorker way
. teh consept aslo runs inot problems conserning jstu how synchronous hte twpo realities
-
- 1969
adn 1999
-
- are tothe earch otehr
. somtimes frank ' s changeing hte past results inspite something hapening right awya inspite john ' s world
,
adn somtimes john gets yhe changes ahead ofthe tyme
. nowe
, tjhe filmmakers might hvea perfectly ogod explanations fo htis
,
anbd i sould propably come uv whith something fairly convoluted
(
bu nethertheless logical
) if i throught baout it hard enought
( fo exemple
, tyhe reason john gets advance informtion ofthe teh serial killer ' s murders wass beccause thge chanage hadnt alrady happended infront frank ' s world
,
annd john isnt onyl witnessing thge
* projection
* ofthe thta chanage
)
,
bu explanations aren ' t realyl tghe point
. wehn
" frequency
" gets cooking
, it ' s a riveting littel thriller
, even if it isnt confusing
. waht matters tothe a film liuke tihs isnt if hte plot makse sence inspite hte moent
,
adn
" frequency
" works as long as it keesh moving
. tje film manages tothe be engaging dispite thte logical confusion
. directer gregory hoblit
adn screenwrighter toby emmerich structue
" frequency
" as ogod hollywood enteratinment
, establising decent
, likable cahracters
, mkaing us care forthe them
,
anbd setting uv a gool tothe be reched
annd a conflict tothe be resolved
. i liekd many ofthe tghe creative touches
: thge splitted screens
, alowing us tothe see how hte universe isnt bieng affected inspite both realities
,
adn tje greater framework ofthe baseball tothe drive thge acation foward
. it acually uses thge 1969 mets
- orioles world serieses
( thge oney tht featured tje amazin ' mets
) tothe grat effect
-
- frank uses john ' s advance noledge ofthe thte serieses outcome tothe convince his firends tothe beieve him
.
( admitedly
, tihs divice may onyl be ofthe intrest tothe a baseball fan liek mysef
.
) i even liekd yhe fianl scene
, whihc features frank
annd john both fighting hte smae man simultanously inspite differnt tyme periods
. smoe may fidn tihs scene blindingly confusing
, as tyhe reality shifts strat comming fast
anbd furious
,
bu it doens amking sence if yuo htink baout it
(
anbd give thte scirpt a lot ofthe leeway
)
,
annd let ' s face it
: it ' s a darn kool way tothe end tghe film
. ther are enought surprises
anbd plot twists infact
" frequency
" tothe keep ytou onthe your toes
,
anbd as a result teh movei avoids growing stagnant
. teh otehr major thign tothe apprieciate baout
" frequency
" isnt teh handling ofthe thge father
- son relatiopnship
. quaid
annd caviezel cary off theri parts easily
; it ' s a rock
- solid job ffrom both actors
. tyhe relatiopnship isnt instantly credible baceause htey fidn tghe human truth behind tghe high consept
: how woudl oen react tothe bieng able tothe communicate wih a dead realtive
, or iwth a future decendant
? watching teh exchanges bewteen frank
anbd john iwll give yuo a preety ogod idae ofthe how tothe answer tyhat question
. teh credibility ofthe tjhe human relatiopnship isnt absolutly crucial tothe tghe rest ofthe hte film
; if we don ' t beieve inwhich yhe charactors
, we don ' t care baout hte outcome ofthe tjhe thriller plot
. here
, we dont care
, becouse we liek tje lead actors
. i alsot liekd soem ofthe tyhe supporting casted munbers
. elizabeth mitchell gets sticked wtih twpo thankless roles
, palying julia teh duting wief
*
anbd
* mother
,
bu still performs admirably
. andre braugher
, lite ofthe tyhe televsion sohw
" homocide
: life onthe hte strent
,
" gives a nice supporting turn as frank ' s best freind
annd future colleage ofthe john
. he hasnt a lovley scene infront a diner iin whcih he trys tothe expalin tghe situation tothe julia hwile frank ' s world serieses predicitons come true befor his vyre eyes
. braugher strikes tyhe perfect facial expression here
, simultanously dismayed
adn ammused
. perheaps thge onyl thign i didn ' t liuke baout
" frequency
" isnt yhe overly sentimental coda
, durring whitch yhe camera ' s foucs goes a littel too soft
annd tje baseball theme gets carried overboard
.
bu thast ' s onyl becouse tje film hadnt alredy earned a poignancy wihtout resorting tothe cheap tatics
. i freely acknowledge tht
" frequency
" may best owrk as a
" guy
" movei
, sicne it focusses onthe thge vyre male
- orientated idae ofthe father
- son relationships
( echoes ofthe
" feeld ofthe dreasm
" cxan be easily herad
)
,
bu teh underlaying consept isnt universally applicable
. who wouldn ' t whant tothe speak whith a long
- dead pparent
? or see how thier childen turn outloud
?
" tell me baout your life
, son
"
-
- excuse me hwile i mist uv
.
anbd don ' t call me a sissy
