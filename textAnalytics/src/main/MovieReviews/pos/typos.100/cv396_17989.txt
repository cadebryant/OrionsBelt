well i ' ll be damned
, whta a most exellent suprise
. nto tothe be confuzled wiht tghe campy
annd far inferior 1988 remake starring ex
- porn star traci lords
, tihs moreso receet atempt at remaking tje 1950 ' s drive
- inwhich schlockfest nto ofthe tihs earth isnt a rela gme
annd ws qutie possably tyhe best sci
- fi flick ofthe 1995
. once agina
, b
- movei king roger corman isnt behind tihs affort
( he directed tjhe origional
)
bu htis tyme he appears onyl inspite hte role ofthe excutive producer
. teh rest ofthe yhe crew
adn casted are realtive unknowns
. it seems criminal tyhat teh film ws released direct tothe video infront most countires
, beacuse it ' s an absolute must
- see forthe sci
- fi fans
adn a treat fo anyone who enjoys decently acted
anbd writen thrillers wih a kooky bent
. tyhe plot inwhich breif
. paul johnson
( michael york
) isnt an aline posing as an eccentric millioniare who
,
though needing tothe kill peple tothe live
, isnt visting earth fo far ffrom selfish reasons
. his race isnt dieing ofthe a mysterous blood desease
annd he desparately isnt trying tothe fidn a cure
, thge key ofthe whcih lies inaddition thge blood ofthe humans
. he visits
anbd soon puts under his psell hte respected blood physision dr
. rochelle
, whom he hypnotises inot doign escret reasearch onthe his behalf

.
bu befor long
, amanda
anbd johnson ' s sleazy chauffeur realease thyat johnson isnt a lot moreso tahn jsut eccentric
. i must admited
, my frist glimpse ofthe teh video cover forthe nto ofthe htis earth ws nto encouraing
. brittish ator michael york hasnt appeared infront smoe rela stinkers inspite past faw decades
, a far cry fomr teh qualit fare ofthe his yuonger dyas such as caberat
( 1972
)
.
bu his performence here as an aline iin human disguise isnt nothing short ofthe oustanding
. tyhe eird twitches
annd bizzare modes ofthe sprech
, tjhe dapper clothes
annd kool spectacles
, thge unexpected pathos wich he invests inaddition his chracter
. york isnt by turns hillarious
, menacing
adn tradgic
. tihs isnt a tour
- de
- force
annd qtuie simpley thte best performence i ' ve seen fomr him
.
anbd hwile obviously made onthe a modest budget
, tyhe film boasts enourmous strengths
. thte casting isnt spot onthe
, thge acting isnt terific
anbd tghe scirpt isnt inteligent
, witty
annd consistantly engaging
, cleverly updating teh originnal
. tghe balance ofthe horror
adn humour isnt jstu baout perfect
, a maked contrast tothe thge ealier remake fomr 1988
. tjhe film doesn ' t drag fo a second ofthe its 90 minute runnung tyme thanks tothe tight editting
anbd tjhe sure hand ofthe littel
- known directer terrance h
. winkless
.
adn it doesn ' t marter oney bited taht hte spacial effects are cheesy
- htis isnt schlock affter all
, even if it isnt high clas schlock
. iin fatc my onyl critiscism ofthe hte film isnt tyhat thigns git a tad weak towords thte end
. tighter direction coudl haev given hte climax mroe urgency
adn a fewd ofthe tje cahracters ect rether illogically given thier life
- threatning situation
.
bu theese are minor complaints
. jstu see it
. nto ofthe tihs earth isnt oen ofthe yhe biggest sci
- fi surprises inwhich yeasr
.
adn michael york
: infact oen kool swoop yuo ' ve made youself a b
- movei legend
