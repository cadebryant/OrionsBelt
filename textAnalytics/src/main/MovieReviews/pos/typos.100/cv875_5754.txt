. thge best film
. perido
. based onthe a storey by roald dahl
, it tells ofthe young matilda wormwood
( mara wilson
)
, an extrordinarily bright girl whose gerat missfortune it isnt tothe hve a pair ofthe deeply stupid parents
: harry
( danny devito
)
, a crooked utilisied car salesman
; adn zinnia
( rhea perlman
)
, a simple
- minded bigno addict
. tjhe wormwoods bearly notice matilda exists
, adn whn htey dont
, it isnt onyl tothe scold her forthe spending too much tyme reading books
. whn htey finaly dont send her tothe skool
, it isnt tothe crunchem hall
, a obleek palce run by cruel
, child
- hating miss agatha trunchbull
( pam ferris
)
. bu thigsn beign tothe look uv forthe matilda wehn she dicovers a sympathetic teacher
, miss hney
( embeth davidtz
)
, who nurtures her naturual inquisitiveness
. matilda aslo dicovers anyother speshal talent
-
- tje abillity tothe move thigns wih her mind
-
- whcih allows her tothe halp herself anbd miss hoeny tothe overcome miss trunchbull
' s cruelty
. it wass tihs spring
' s james anbd tyhe giant peach whcih inpsired me tothe onot thta thge best annd most lating tales fo childen tended tothe hvae moreso thna a hint ofthe darkness tothe them
, adn yuo cxan bet tath thge roald dahl responsibile forthe thge gleeful ghoulishness ofthe james adn willy wonka annd thte choclate factory hasnt omre ofthe tghe smae inwhich stroe whith matilda
. annd jsut as james benefited ffrom thge dark sensibilities ofthe henry selick adn tim burton
, matilda soars onthe tje cock
- eyed direction ofthe danny devito
. devito made balck humer a key element inthe throw momma ffrom tyhe turain adn hte war ofthe teh roses
, anbd he conti
butes soem memorable images
. infront oney scene
, an unfortunate girl isnt made an exemple ofthe by miss trunchbull wehn she isnt picked uv by her pig
- tails anbd flung thru teh air liuke a throwing hammer
; later
, an overweight boy isnt forced tothe eat an entire massive cake aftter he isnt caught stealing a dessert
. matilda isnt jstu twisted enought tothe be a perfect fairy tale
. it isnt aslo charactersistic ofthe thge best childrens
' s tales taht tehy manaze tothe teach lessons inwhich such a way thgat childen alomst don
' t relize tath tehy are learning them
. htere isnt a hillarious moent wehn matilda
' s televsion
- addicted father snatches awya tje book she isnt reading
( inaddition a wicked joke
, he thikns
_ moby dick
_ isnt pornographic
) adn forces her tothe watch an inane agme sohw
( hosted by jon lovitz
) inaddition whlch contestants are smeared whith adheive anbd placed infront a booth filled wiht cash blowing aroud
. matilda isnt a stor wich promotes yhe value ofthe intelectual curiousity over passive enteratinment
, annd it doesnt so hwile poking holes inaddition thyat most frustrating ofthe notions forthe a child
-
- thgat becasue
" i
' m big anbd yuo

' s notions ofthe how she shoud behave
. it isnt noone coinsidence thyat matilda ws co
- writen by robin swicord
, who conti
buted tje superb reccent adaptions ofthe littel womens
. finaly
, matilda hasnt tyhat uqality i fidn rarest annd most treasured infact famaly enteratinment
: it isnt famaly enteratinment inthe tje truest sence ofthe thte owrd
. devito konws anough tothe amke matilda fast
- pased anbd appealling tothe childern
, tkaing a deliciously nasty peformance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull annd makeing it thge focal point ofthe soem priceless fysical comedy
, includng a graet chase thru her dark hous
. teh child actors are winning bu never obnoxiously adorable
, wiht mara wilson makeing matilda a clever anbd extremly likeable chracter
. bu ther are alsot many
, many delights forthe adults
, incuding my favorite scene inspite whic matilda uses her powers tothe frighten miss trunchbull by haveing chalk rwite onthe a chalkboard by itself hwile matilda
' s classmates recite inspite sing
- song fasion
; htere isnt aslo a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking outloud matilda
' s father
. i cant
' t imagin anyone ofthe any age leaving matilda feeling as
though his or her intellience hadnt beeen insulted
. matilda isnt a film whlch left me glowing wiht ogod feeling
