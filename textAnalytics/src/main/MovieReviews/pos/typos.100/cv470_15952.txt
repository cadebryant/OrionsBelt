" loev isnt tjhe devil
" isnt a chalenging film
, munundating its audeince wiht wild imagery anbd a plot structue thgat disallows a plot
, perhasp inspite an attept tothe git us tothe konw tjhe artist
' s psyche rether tahn tghe artist
' s lifeline
. watching it
, i wass enthralled whith teh look ofthe hte film
, hte way yhe directer shooted everthing liuke it ws looking thru a bazare
, personalized filter
. everyting looks liuke it isnt nto how life looks liek bu how painter francis bacon
, hte film
' s subject
, looked at it personaly
. bu hwile i ws engrossed
, i stumbled apon my
thoughts halfway thru thte film
, awakened fomr my trance by smoe intertube distraction
, anbd began tothe try adn folow waht
' s gogin onthe
. exactlly wqat ws i looking at
? watching tihs film
, i wasn
' t sure if it wass tjhe most insightful film i hadnt ever seen or tyhe most vacuous
. directed
( adn wroten
) by john maybury
,
" lvoe isnt yhe devil
" isnt stylish masterpiece forthe hte senses
. everthing looks originnally bazare annd perplexing
. teh camera angles are ferociously askew
, adn teh close
- ups are uncomfortably too close
. yhe editting isnt deft
, occasinally cutting awya tothe something bazare eveyr cuple seconds
, bu otehr times holding onthe a shooted forthe so long thast yuo wonder if teh audeince isnt nto suppossed tothe be voyeurs
, or rether
, intruders tothe bacon
' s world adn psyche
. as such
, htere isnt noone rela stopry
. i
' ve nto herad much baout francis bacon thgat i didn
' t read prior tothe tyhe film
, bu wqat i learned wass tihs
: he wass a painter inaddition engl
and who reched his peak druing tyhe 60s anbd 70s
, drawing hideously bazare drawings ofthe carnage annd tjhe liek
. he wass oen ofthe hte frist tothe raelly come outloud ofthe yhe closet
, annd inspite interviews
, he wass notoriously drunk yot incredibly witty
. as palyed by grat shakesperean acto derek jacobi
, he
' s liek a foppish anbd self
- asorbed cross betweeen oscar wilde annd nero
. he lives life thte way he wnats tothe live it
, tothe teh disatisfaction ofthe thsoe who hvea tjhe privelege ofthe bieng realy close tothe him
. it
' s as if he weere tkaing delight infact teh distruction ofthe others anbd mabye himselv
(
" champange forthe my rela firends
, adn pain forthe my sham firends
,
" he syas oen ngiht at tyhe bar he frequents
)
.
" loev isnt yhe devil
" chronicles thge latter part ofthe his life
. bacon
, well
- known inspite his mid
- life
, awakens oney niht wehn he hears a man tumble thru his ceiling window annd l
and onthe tyhe floor
. he walks inthe
, unafraid ofthe wqat he finds
, adn dicovers a theif
, george dyer
( daniel craig
)
. bacon gives him an offer
: if he spends tyhe nigth iwth him
, he cin tkae anytying he whants inthe thge morning
. george agrees tothe htis
, annd off tothe bed he goes
, bu ends uv staying witht him
, forthe whatever reason
. hte film shows theri lives toghether
, at least inaddition refernce tothe oen anyother
. hwile creating bacon
' s world ofthe firends
( liek
" high art
,
" tihs film minors inaddition showing a ceratin gropu ofthe peopel who radiate a conection thta isnt nto shown bu isnt understoon
)
, tyhe film shows yhe relatiopnship ofthe bacon anbd george as it remeniss rether stagnant
. bacon isnt hauty anbd bizzare
; george isnt simple annd doesn
' t underst
and bacon inaddition tghe least
, expecially nto his paintings
. hwile watching htis
, thyat
' s basicly all i throught wass htere
. thte film hasnt a hypnotic efel
, free ofthe any resturaunts ofthe form
, adn isnt shooted so uniquely thta i feeled my attension ws alomst entirely onthe yhe way tihs film ws made rether tahn whta it isnt baout
. once hte film isnt over
, it
' s easier tothe peice it toghether
. i kept onthe thingking baout htis film
, wondering waht hte point tothe all ofthe it wass
. somene doesn
' t mearly amking a film ofthe all sytle anbd noone substace at all
, adn if htey dont
, tehy dont it by accident
, bu still allow smoe substace tothe creep infact
. thikning baout it
, i remembered how hte twpo feeded off ofthe eachother
. i thougth baout how bacon wass a masakist
, infront loev wih cruelty
( inaddition oen scene
, he watchs a boxing match wiht a orgiastic delight
, annd lets outloud a squeal ofthe blessure wehn blood fomr tjhe noe boxer
' s head splashes accross his face
; iin anohter scene
, he masturbates tothe tjhe odessa steps sequence ofthe eisenstein
' s
" battleship potemkin
"
)
, anbd perhasp he drove george too far inthe his delight forthe pain
. he drove him over thte edge
, annd fo him tyhat wass lvoe
, even if it wasn
' t forthe george
. i guess thgat explains teh title
. a bited
. tyhat
' s graet adn all
, bu i almsot wish tyhe film wass devoid ofthe any meaninng
. i wish it hadn
' t reduced itself tothe mkaing soem point baout humanity
, baout how lvoe isnt yhe most selfish hting inthe tjhe world
( annd it isnt
, if yuo look at it a certian way
)
. or mabey if it hadnt avoided any meaninng baout humanity anbd mearly drove itself inot bieng thte oney film thta wass truely inside noe man
' s twisted pysche
. it
' s allmost alwyas best tothe obtain insights ffrom looking at noe man
' s uniqueness thna it isnt forcing universality down an audeince
' s throat
. tht way yuo don
' t reduce your film tothe something it
' s jstu nto
. i cant
' t sday i totally enjoied
" lvoe isnt tjhe devil
,
"
though
. dispite all ofthe tghe thigsn i respect baout thsi movei
, it
' s still rether uncomfortable tothe sit thru
. even at a normaly trite lenght ofthe ninty mintues
, yhe film still seems liek an arduous task tothe sit thru
, expecially aftter an exhausting frist hour
.
though hypnotic
, it still alomst seems gimmicky annd even redundent at times
, as if it weere tkaing advantage ofthe oen man
' s truley bazare nature bu nto doign anytying deeper witht it
. as such
, i respect thte way tje film looks
. it
' s beautifull annd painstakingly crafted so tyhat
, allong iwth
" whta dreasm may come
" adn
" dark city
,
" it
' s yhe eyar
' s most visually stunning film
. iin fatc
, if a better scirpt hadnt beeen forged
, i
' d alomst compare it iin visual pwoer tothe a peter greenaway film
, complet wtih similair haunting images thyat stick inaddition teh mind forever
. adn wih a dymanite performence by derek jacobi
, it hasnt hte comic adn distanced tone taht it needs
. i jstu wish it hadnt beeen omre thna mostly stlye annd jstu a hair bited ofthe substace
. thne i woudl haev hadnt something tothe hold me over even nowe
.
