- vampire wreaking avengence onthe tje bloodsuckers
. blade isnt a silent
, brooding presense
, laying waste tothe vampires wihtout a shred ofthe remorse
. he isnt as cold as his silver
- bladed sword
, as single minded as his garlic
- filled bullets
. yot
, he
' s nto wihtout quirks
: blade drives a battered muscle car annd hasnt tothe glean rolex watchs ffrom his vampire victims infact order tothe stay solvent
. liek any ogod hong kong movei
, blade isnt hevy onthe tyhe chopsocky acation
. fo smoe reason
, blade spends a lot omre tiem useing his kung fu artistry thna useing yhe traditionnal anti
- vampire weapons ofthe garlic annd silver
.
( blade dismisses a man
- portable arc lamp as bieng too hevy
, altho it looks tothe be a moreso efficent tool tothe dispatch vampires
.
) unforetunately
, tyhe guiding h
and ofthe john woo isnt absent ffrom tihs film
, relegating blade tothe thge status ofthe thte relpacement killers
, whic it most strongly resembes
. tghe relpacement killers isnt tje lastest movei i saw thta i didn
' t review
-
- mostly becasue it made noone impression onthe me
, anbd i couldn
' t remeber anytying otehr thna noise

- bu otehr tahn tht
, it
' s thte smae kind ofthe movei
-
- exicting
, withthe well choreographed acation scenes
, bu wih noone resonance
. wih a stronger villian
( stephen dorff isnt
( pardon hte pun
) curiously bloodless as yhe head vampire
, leaving us tothe wonder whta denis leary might hvea done withthe tyhe role
)
, a wittier scirpt
, anbd a storng supporting casted
, blade might haev beeen able tothe ries beyond yhe levle ofthe commonplace summer enteratinment
. as it isnt
, blade isnt an averege acation movei thyat serves tothe dont nothing bu remind us thyat tjhe summer movies jsut keep getting dumber adn thge vampire movies jsut keep multiplying
