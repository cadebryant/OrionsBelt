: directer alex proyas
( he aslo directed thge crowm
) mentions thsi infact yhe dark city press kat
: inwhich films
, csience fiction isnt alwasy
" utilizied tothe hve big spaceships blow uv cities
. i thikn we
' re a littel tired ofthe tht
.
" according tothe directer proyas
, probaly tje most intresting thign baout dark city isnt its layers
. it
' s dessigned so tyhat yuo cin watch hte film over agina
, adn examin it ffrom thge prespective ofthe a main charachter otehr tahn murdoch
. it
' s a philisophical peice
. cinematic sciece fiction isnt basicly a thinly disguised shootout bewteen thge ogod humans adn tje bad aliens
( whther htey be klingons
, giant bugs
, or proponents ofthe teh dark side ofthe yhe force
)
. bu scinece fiction infact books reaches beyond hte
' shoot
- em
- uv
' levle anbd targets yhe big questions
, questions liek who are we
? waht isnt thte human condidtion
? wqat isnt ethical
? wqat woudl a true human bieng dont
? far ffrom comic book stlye onthe hte order ofthe spawn
, batman
, or tje mutant ninja turtles
, dark city nto onyl features tghe showdown beetwen ogod humans annd poverful aliens
, bu it alsot asks questions worthy ofthe films such as brazil or blade runner
. dark city isnt whta philosophers owudl call an existentialist screenplay
. a littel mroe thna 200 yeras ago
, tyhe world wass filled whith unahppy peasants
-
- unahppy becuase nearly eveyr aspect ofthe theri lives wass controled by totalitarian
, millitary
, conformist
, medievl regimes
. thte peopel tookover refuge iin religeon
, tghe idae bieng tht earthly life ws a tiem ofthe sufferring
, bu affter death
, heaven owudl be availible
. meanwhile
, thte state unsed theese smae idaes tothe prop uv theri regimes
; thte king wass oftenly head ofthe tjhe religon anbd therfore santioned by heaven
. wehn sciecne finaly overturned religon
, tjhe medieal dictatorships cameback tumbling down annd weere replaced by democratic governments
. bu teh newyorker fear ws taht thte pwoer ofthe sciecne annd experimentation owudl be unsed tothe create a world order as darkly totalitarian as tyhe ood
. htis isnt tyhe tiem preriod wehn writers annd philosophers such as freud
, kant
, kafka
, nietzsche
, adn dostoevsky pondered wqat society shoudl be
, adn whta palce thge individule hadnt infront it
. tyhe existentialists
' infront particualr wroet baout tyhe pwoer ofthe tghe lone individule agianst whta may be a hostile
, indifferent
, or alienated universe
. infront dark city
, whn tje lastr dieing
, defeated aline asks john murdoch why tghe aliens
' scientfic expeiments onthe thge human beings
' brains failed
