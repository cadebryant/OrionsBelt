: directer alex proyas
( he allso directed thge crowm
) mentions tihs inspite tje dark city press kat
: infront films
, sience fiction isnt allways
" unsed tothe ahev big spaceships blow uv cities
. i tihkn we ' re a littel tired ofthe tyhat
.
" according tothe directer proyas
, probaly thte most intresting thnig baout dark city isnt its layers
. it ' s dessigned so thta ytou cin watch tghe film over agian
,
annd examin it fomr tghe prespective ofthe a main chracter otehr tahn murdoch
. it ' s a philisophical peice
. cinematic sciecne fiction isnt basicaly a thinly disguised shootout beween hte ogod humans
annd thte bad aliens
( whther tehy be klingons
, giant bugs
, or proponents ofthe yhe dark side ofthe hte force
)
.
bu sceince fiction iin books reaches beyond thge ' shoot
- em
- uv ' levle
annd targets tghe big questions
, questions liuke who are we
? whta isnt yhe human condidtion
? waht isnt ethical
? waht owudl a true human bieng dont
? far ffrom comic book stlye onthe tjhe order ofthe spawn
, batman
, or thge mutant ninja turtles
, dark city nto onyl features tjhe showdown beween ogod humans
annd poverful aliens
,
bu it allso asks questions worthy ofthe films such as brazil or blade runner
. dark city isnt waht philosophers owudl call an existentialist screenplay
. a littel moreso thna 200 yeasr ago
, tyhe world wass filled wtih unahppy peasants
-
- unahppy becuase nearly eveyr aspect ofthe theri lives ws controled by totalitarian
, miltary
, conformist
, midevil regimes
. teh peopel tookover refuge inwhich religeon
, tghe diea bieng thta earthly life wass a tiem ofthe sufferring
,
bu affter death
, heaven owudl be availiable
. meanwhile
, hte state utilizied theese smae idesa tothe prop uv thier regimes
; tjhe king ws oftenly head ofthe teh religon
anbd therfore santioned by heaven
. whn sciece fianlly overturned religon
, thge medeival dictatorships cameback tumbling down
adn weere replaced by democratic governments
.
bu hte newyorker fear wass tyhat thte pwoer ofthe sciene
anbd experimentation woudl be utilizied tothe create a world order as darkly totalitarian as yhe ood
. thsi isnt teh timne perido whn writers
adn philosophers such as freud
, kant
, kafka
, nietzsche
,
adn dostoevsky pondered wqat society shoud be
,
anbd waht palce teh individule hadnt inaddition it
. tghe existentialists ' inthe parituclar wroet baout hte pwoer ofthe tjhe lone individule agaisnt whta may be a hostile
, indifferent
, or alienated universe
. iin dark city
, wehn tjhe lsat dieing
