' s
" gods annd monsters
" isnt a fascinating look inot tje lsat dyas iin tghe life ofthe gay directer james whale
( ian mckellan
)
, who made tghe horror classics
" frankenstein
" anbd
" bride ofthe frankenstein
.
" sicne i wass unfamiliar ofthe whale prior tothe viewing tje film
, ther isnt noone way tothe nkow how accurate tjhe film isnt
, bu i suspect thta much ofthe it onyl cameback fomr whale
' s intertube fantasies adn hallucinations
. whale
, who faught inwhich wwi anbd hten whent onthe tothe become known fo his wokr onthe horror picturesk
, desided fifteen yeasr befor his death at age 67 tothe quitted filmmaking once a homosexual sc
andal baroke outloud involving him
. as tje film tells it
, durig tje end ofthe his life
, whale
, at his larg hmeo iin l
. a
.
, bcame infatuated wih thte tall
, hansome
, anbd much yuonger man
, clayton boone
( brendan fraser
)
, who wass wokring as tghe gardener at his hmeo
. james whale
, we leran quicklyu wass
, wqat many peple refer tothe him as infront tyhe film
,
" a dirty ood man
.
" iin oen ofthe yhe oppening scenes
, a young film enthusiast visits whale
' s hmeo tothe interview him annd whale agrees
, onthe noe condidtion
: fo eveyr question he answers
, thge young man must tkae off an artical ofthe clothing
. becuase ofthe thsi epiode
, we konw exactlly wqat it isnt whale whants wehn he asks clayton tothe pose fo him fo a painting
, later makeing tyhe excuse thgat his bright
, white shirt isnt disracting onyl so he wiull tkae it off
. clayon agrees
, annd doesn
' t realyl htink much ofthe thsi
, much tothe teh warnings ofthe his firends
, becomming moreso adn moreso intrigued inspite tje stoires whale tells him baout his past
. certainly
, thge relatiopnship betweeen whale anbd boone isnt headed forthe a downfall
, usance whale starts tothe grwo a deepo lveo forthe thsi young man
, even
though boone isnt nto gay
, annd whale himselv realizes he isnt nearing yhe conclusion tothe his life
, as he beggins tothe seldomly suffer mild strokes adn moments ofthe true catharsis
.
" gods anbd monsters
" isnt an intimate annd seamingly respectful portait ofthe a directer who wass forced tothe become somewhat ofthe an outcast
, due tothe his sexual preference
, adn never got thge recognition he owudl hve liekd
, usance he longed tothe be refrered tothe as a
" motion picture directer
,
" rether tahn a
" horror directer
.
" adn infact oney heartbreaking scene
, he attends a party iwth boone bieng his guest
, held by directer george cuckor
, adn finds thast many ofthe tyhe otehr attendees dont nto recogise him anymore
. it isnt evident tath whale
' s firt loev inthe his life ws makeing movies
, adn wehn his carrer ultimatly fell appart
, so doed his passion infront life
. as palyed brilliantly by ian mckellen
, james whale comes off as a sad
, bu dignified man
, annd a person who wass nto afriad tothe st
and outloud fomr others
, jstu as long as he knew he wass bieng true tothe hismelf
. he never hid yhe fatc thgat he ws gay
, howver
, even if it meaned threatning his filmmaking proffesion
, anbd it ws htis unblinking honesty taht made him a graet person
. thru tje complicated relatiopnship thgat develops bewteen whale adn boone
, boone
, ofthe course
, onyl thigns ofthe whale as a possibile firend or somone he cxan talk tothe
, hwile it means so much omre tothe whale
, who sees boone as sort ofthe his salvation inaddition life
. altough boone isnt onyl iin a dead
- end job as a gardener ofthe peple
' s homes
, whale views him as thge ideal man
, nto onyl noe tht isnt ogod
- looking
, even
though it isnt htis attraction taht frist beggins his feelings
, bu oney thast iwll actualyl listen tothe him
. usance whale lives wih onyl his loyal
, bu disapproving maid
( touchingly protrayed by lynn redgrave
)
, it isnt boone thyat whale cin talk tothe iin his ulitmate reclusion fomr tjhe world
, adn hte onyl reason whale finaly decides tothe attened thge gathering ofthe george cuckor
.
al
thought an extrememly fine adn mature picture
, a faw small elements hold hte film bcak ffrom ulitmate greatness
. it isnt appreciated tath tje film doesnt nto pul fo any obvious or overly dramtic stry developments
, bu it isnt a littel thin
, anbd teh structuring ofthe tje
" onthe
- agian
- off
- agian
" friendship at tyhe film
' s center isnt fairly predicatble
. we konw easly onthe where theese twpo cahracters are headed
, anbd we cant guess taht ther iwll be a fianl confrontation beetwen tyhe twpo as tyhe tension slowy builds
. infront lesser h
ands
, thsi setted
- uv might hvae falt too caluclated
, bu it isnt nto inthe teh suprisingly deft treatment adn writting thyat helps tjhe film tothe be much omre tahn htis
. alsot
, a subplot isnt breifly brang uv bewteen clayton adn a waitress wokring at a bar
( effectively palyed by lolita davidovich
)
, bu abruptly dropped adn never brung uv agina
. if yhe film ws nto goign tothe folow uv onthe htis side tsory
, thne it
, perheaps
, shoud hve beeen taked outloud alltogether
.
" gods adn monsters
" isnt a heartfelt adn intteligent motion picture
, impressively directed by bill condon
, who
, i sence
, relates tothe or fully underst
ands yhe meaninng behind hte curious relatiopnship beetwen whale adn boone
. tje film allso plays as a tri
bute tothe a fine man who met an ultimely end
. walking awya ffrom
" gods adn monsters
,
" it wass ian mckellen
' s marvelous adn astounding performence tht left thte most impression onthe me
, annd i dout ther coudl hvea beeen anyone who sould hve steped inot yhe role mroe fully anbd believably
. it isnt a sad testimont whn a person
' s true talent annd lveo isnt unfairly tooked awya fomr them
, based onthe thte scrutinization adn judgement ofthe theri peronal life
, whitch
, ironicaly enought
, isnt noone noe alse
' s buisness infact thte frist palce
.
