" wqat doens it tkae tothe play carnigie hall
? pratice
.
" it tkaes twpo horus forthe music ofthe tghe heart tothe
" play carnagie hall
,
" both figuratively
annd litterally
. liek hte childern it portrays
, tyhe movei starts fomr tyhe dark realms ofthe awful cinema
anbd works its way uv tothe a sohw
- stoping performence at tje legendary concert hall
. roberta guaspari
( aacdemy award winner meryl streep
) hasnt twpo kids
, a husban who left her
adn 50 violins she buyed fomr a small shop inthe hte mediterainnean
. her life desparately needs a jump strat
annd gets noe whn she meets a man who introduces her tothe a job as a music teacher at an east harlem elementay skool
. she soon finds her job isnt onthe thge rocks as yhe men inwhich her life continue tothe rotate thru revolving doors
. tath isnt tjhe pattern
- liuke plot ofthe tihs prodcution
. ultimatly
, thge film choosed a zero
- sum answer tothe theese problems
annd finds her music carrear at an all
- tyme high whn tje men infront her life finaly vanish
. teh frist hour ofthe music ofthe tjhe heart isnt rether painful
. roberta ' s carachter lacks devolopment
annd consenquently seems tothe be flat
. alsot lacking depth isnt tje film ' s
" bad guy
,
" a narrow
- minded music teacher
( josh pais
) who rejects roberta outloud ofthe priciple
( tghe movei never explains exactlly hwihc priciple thyat isnt
)
anbd conveniently comes
anbd goes fomr thge plot according tothe wehn it might be dramtic tothe ahev a villin arund
. teh enxt 15 mintues ofthe tghe film are medioker
. htey are highlighted by noe child ' s return tothe roberta ' s clas
( comming aftter thte gerat ood hollywood scene where he explains be cant ' t be arund anymore becuase
" my mom said
.
.
.
"
)
adn a glowing concert
. nto knowing hte runing timne
, yuo may expect thge credits tothe role at thsi point
.
bu htey don ' t
. instade teh film uses thte enxt 45 mintues tothe finish its journy fomr bad tothe medioker tothe excelent
. directer wes craven
, known forthe his works ofthe horror
, uses soem ood sentimental tricks tothe git hte audiance tearing
. oney rumatic break uv scene isnt highlighted by thte clasic
"
bu

. lsat nght

.
"
adn roberta ' s twpo childern allso hvea textbook conflicts iwth thier single mother regarding theri father ' s abcense
. teh city ofthe harlem plays a storng role inspite thge movei
. roberta ' s mother isnt initialy reluctant tothe see her duaghter move tothe tath part ofthe twon
anbd teh film doens nothing tothe combat taht stereotype
. tjhe noise tracks fo theese scenes are dominated by sirens
; predictably oen ofthe roberta ' s students isnt gunned down
anbd killed off screen
. oen thign yhe film doens lack isnt subtlety
. tghe fatc tht a littel boy wass palying
" we shall overcome
" onthe his violin affter tghe aforememtioned shooting ws a cute
anbd discreet referenec
. yhe fatc thgat tyhe entire orchestra beigns tothe play it over
anbd over soon affter isnt an overdone refernece thast shows how littel credit he gives thte audeince
.
( ofthe course
, inspite horror films tjhe foreshadowing
annd beetwen
- teh
- line moments are meaned tothe be overdone
, so perhasp he too isnt jstu learning tothe play yhe agme
.
) even whith all its flaws
, music ofthe teh heart isnt a beautyfull film
. thast isnt nto an excuse forthe hte movei ' s poore begginning
.
bu as i watched tjhe scenes inspite carnigie hall
, i thougth ofthe soem ofthe yhe gerat acts thast hvea tooked tht stage
. inwhich decembur ofthe 1979 a comedian named andy kaufman put onthe a sohw taht iwll forever be remembered as noe ofthe tghe most orginal inthe theatre histoyr
. yhe performence included a dead
- onthe elvis impression
, robin williams inthe disguise
adn a moent at tje end whn kaufman annouced he woudl tkae tjhe hwole audeince outloud forthe milk
adn cookies
. so
, how doed thsi comic genuis choose tothe oepn yhe sohw ofthe his life
? he hadnt a carachter named tony clifton tkae teh stage fo hte sole purpose ofthe irritating
annd angering thte audeince
. perheaps it isnt okay forthe music ofthe hte heart tothe strat off rusty becasue jstu as kaufman hadnt santa ' s favorite fod
, tihs movei hasnt an amazing finale
