" bad guy
,
" a narrow
- minded music teacher
( josh pais
) who rejects roberta outloud ofthe priciple

" adn roberta
' s twpo childen allso ahev textbook conflicts wtih theri single mother regarding thier father
' s abcence
. tghe city ofthe harlem plays a storng role infact yhe movei
. roberta
' s mother isnt initally reluctant tothe see her daugter move tothe tath part ofthe twon adn tghe film doens nothing tothe combat thyat stereotype
. teh noise tracks fo theese scenes are dominated by sirens
; predictably oney ofthe roberta
' s students isnt gunned down adn killed off screen
. noe thnig tje film doens lack isnt subtlety
. tyhe fatc thast a littel boy ws palying
" we shall overcome
" onthe his violin affter hte aforememtioned shooting wass a cute anbd discreet reefrence
. tyhe fatc tyhat thte entire orchestra beggins tothe play it over adn over soon affter isnt an overdone referrence thyat shows how littel credit he gives tjhe audeince
.
( ofthe course
, inwhich horror films tyhe foreshadowing annd betwen
- tje
- line moments are meaned tothe be overdone
, so prehaps he too isnt jsut learning tothe play hte gae
.
) even wiht all its flaws
, music ofthe tyhe heart isnt a beautifull film
. thta isnt nto an excuse fo tyhe movei
' s poore begginning
. bu as i watched thte scenes inwhich carnigie hall
, i thougth ofthe smoe ofthe teh gerat acts thta hve tooked tyhat stage
. inspite desember ofthe 1979 a comedian named
andy kaufman put onthe a sohw tyhat wiull forever be remembered as oen ofthe tyhe most orginial inspite theatre hisory
. tyhe peformance included a dead
- onthe elvis impression
, robin williams inspite disguise annd a moent at tghe end whn kaufman anounced he owudl tkae thge hwole audiance outloud forthe milk annd cookies
. so
, how doed htis comic genuis choose tothe ope teh sohw ofthe his life
? he hadnt a charactor named tony clifton tkae tje stage fo tyhe sole purpose ofthe irritating annd angering teh audiance
. perhasp it isnt okay forthe music ofthe thge heart tothe strat off rusty becuase jstu as kaufman hadnt santa
' s favorite foode
, thsi movei hasnt an amazing finale
