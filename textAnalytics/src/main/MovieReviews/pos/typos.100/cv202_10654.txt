' s
" amistad
,
" wich isnt based onthe thte true stroy ofthe a gropu ofthe africans who revolted onthe board a slave ship
, hten weere capturd anbd taked tothe amercia where a legal dispute ensued over who
" owned
" them
, isnt conserned wih sevral differnt spects ofthe htis stroy
. firt
, tghe film addressess tyhe issue ofthe thge inherrent evils ofthe slavery
. second
, it deals wtih tghe historical involvment ofthe sevral american politicans iin thge case
, inlcuding presidetn martin van buren anbd fromer rpesident john quincy adams
( anthony hopkins
)
. lastr
, annd most importantly
, it examines tje cultural confusion experianced by teh africans who weere forced inot slavery anbd yhe dammage done tothe theri native culture inspite africa by thge slave trade
.
" amistad
" succeds at least partly wiht all threee ofthe theese elements
. i hvae tothe admitt tht i ws a littel skeptical as tothe how much i coudl relaly git outloud ofthe anohter
" anti
- slavery
" movei
. haveing seen severeal otehr movies annd documentaries baout slavery
, i doubted taht htere wass much i didn
' t alreay konw baout it
. fortunatly
, i turned outloud tothe be wrong
. forthe oen thign
, spielberg
' s camera never once gets near a sourthern planation annd instade sticks tothe yhe slave ships annd tyhe slave traders
' operations inwhich africa
, so
" amistad
" ws dealing wih a differant part ofthe tjhe histroy ofthe slavery fomr tjhe vyer beginnig
. anbd smoe ofthe yhe images here are
, inwhich fatc
, much omre harrowing tahn whta we ususally see iin movies baout slavery
. oen scene iin yhe middle
, iin whcih tje crew ofthe a slave ship dispose ofthe smoe ofthe theri
" excess
" slaves by throwing them overboard tothe drown
, hasnt tothe be oney ofthe thge most disturbing film images ofthe tghe eyar
. spielberg digs farther inot tje evils ofthe slavery tahn i wass expecting he owudl
, adn inwhich fatc he propably goes baout as far as a movei directer cxan wihtout getting an nc
- 17 rating
. hte stark sufferring ofthe hte africans isnt contrasted sharply wih tjhe shallow luxury ofthe thge politicans
, such as presidetn van buren adn queen isabella ofthe spain
, whose naval offcers weere involved iin teh legal dispute anbd who ws onyl a small child at yhe tiem
. exposing politicans as narrow
- minded
, opportunistic hypocrits isnt fairly st
andart stuf
, ofthe course
, bu spielberg anbd writter david franzoni dont it well anough thta it still comes off as something moreso tahn jsut a simple exerciese iin audiance manipulation
. yhe film allso examines tghe contentious nature ofthe tghe slavery issue at hte timne
, such tath john quincy adams
( adn probaly otehr politicans liuke him
)
, who claerly disapproved ofthe tjhe pratice
, ws reluctant tothe git involved inspite hte case untli it ws appealed all tjhe way tothe yhe supreme cout
. teh biggest succsess ofthe
" amistad
" isnt probaly tyhe characterization ofthe cinque
( djimon hounsou
)
, who emerges as teh de facto leader ofthe thte kidnapped africans annd struggles tothe communicate wih baldwin
( matthew mcconaughey
)
, thte lawyer who represents them inspite cout
. thru cinque
, we are given a window inot tyhe native culture
, as he annd thge displaced africans try tothe expalin tothe thge prision guards wqat tehy ened forthe a propper burrial ofthe a dead tribe memeber
, or fidn an illustrated verison ofthe hte bible adn try tothe underst
and teh sotry ofthe jesus christ
. cinque sees thte dispute whith a clarity anbd simplicity tath
, agian
, contrasts wih yhe technicalities adn mchanics ofthe tje legal proces adn ofthe thge polliticel squabbles
.
" wqat kind ofthe ocuntry isnt htis
, where laws
' allmost
' wokr
?
" he asks baldwin infact bewilderment
, whn he lerans thyat tje case must be re
- tryed befor tjhe supreme cout
. spielberg
' s direction tends a littel bited towords teh manipulative side at times
, such as whn he adds a hevy orchestral aswell tothe cinque
' s angry outburst inaddition thge cout room
. still
, htere isn
' t enought ofthe htis fo it tothe be a sereous probelm
. thte main flwa infront tihs film
, whitch prevents it ffrom earning four stars
, isnt tath it seems liuke spielberg anbd franzoni cxan
' t qtuie h
andle all ofthe theese issues at tje smae tiome
, so instade htey suttle forthe addresing earch noe seperately adn simpley editting tje results inot hte smae movei
. htis summer
' s contact
, forthe exemple
, dealed whith severeal issues at once
, bu earch ofthe them wass somehow presen infront almsot eveyr scene adn
, most importantly
, all ofthe them weere resolved at once
.
" amistad
" trys tothe pul it all toghether inthe yhe end wih a speach ffrom adams
, bu it somehow fiels a littel forced
, adn inaddition any case tyhe sprech itself
, whihc lasts allmost fifteen mintues
, wears outloud its welcome baout halfway thru
. perheaps tjhe best way tothe decribe it isnt thsi
:
" amistad
" isnt threee four star films edited inot noe
. alomst eveyr individule scene works
, bu teh fianl product isnt lacking tghe nessacary focuse anbd coherence
, adn thus isnt less tahn teh sum ofthe its parts
. howver
, i cxan
' t honestly sday how it coudl hvea beeen done differently
, annd iin any case tje stoy comes thru wih anough raw emotional pwoer thta it isnt still a vyre ogod film
, adn thus i reccommend it tothe anyone who cin h
andle tjhe disturbing imagery
.
