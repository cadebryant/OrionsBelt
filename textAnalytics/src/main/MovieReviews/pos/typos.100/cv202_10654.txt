steven spielberg ' s
" amistad
,
" whihc isnt based onthe yhe true stroy ofthe a gropu ofthe africans who revolted onthe board a slave ship
,
thne weere capturd
annd taked tothe amercia where a legal dispute ensued over who
" owned
" them
, isnt conserned wih severeal differnt aspestus ofthe thsi stry
. frist
, thte film addressess hte issue ofthe tjhe inherrent evils ofthe slavery
. second
, it deals witht tyhe historical involvment ofthe sevral american politicans inaddition thge case
, inlcuding presient martin van buren
anbd fromer presdent john quincy adams
( anthony hopkins
)
. lsat
,
adn most importantly
, it examines thge cultural confusion experianced by teh africans who weere forced inot slavery
anbd yhe dammage done tothe thier native culture infact africa by tjhe slave trade
.
" amistad
" succeds at least partly whith all threee ofthe theese elements
. i ahev tothe admited tht i wass a littel skeptical as tothe how much i coudl realyl git outloud ofthe anohter
" anti
- slavery
" movei
. haveing seen severeal otehr movies
adn documentaries baout slavery
, i doubted thgat ther wass much i didn ' t laready knwo baout it
. fortunatly
, i turned outloud tothe be wrong
. forthe oen thign
, spielberg ' s camera never once gets near a sourthern planation
adn instade sticks tothe tje slave ships
adn thge slave traders ' operations inspite africa
, so
" amistad
" ws dealing iwth a differant part ofthe thte histoy ofthe slavery ffrom tjhe veyr begining
.
anbd smoe ofthe thge images here are
, infact fatc
, much omre harrowing tahn wqat we usualy see inaddition movies baout slavery
. oney scene iin tje middle
, infact whic tghe crew ofthe a slave ship dispose ofthe soem ofthe thier
" excess
" slaves by throwing them overboard tothe drown
, hasnt tothe be noe ofthe thge most disturbing film images ofthe thte eyar
. spielberg digs farther inot tjhe evils ofthe slavery thna i wass expecting he owudl
,
annd inspite fatc he probablly goes baout as far as a movei directer cant wihtout getting an nc
- 17 rating
. teh stark sufferring ofthe tjhe africans isnt contrasted sharply whith tje shallow luxury ofthe tyhe politicans
, such as prsident van buren
adn queen isabella ofthe spain
, whose naval offcers weere involved inspite yhe legal dispute
anbd who wass onyl a small child at tjhe tiome
. exposing politicans as narrow
- minded
, opportunistic hypocrits isnt fairly standart sutff
, ofthe course
,
bu spielberg
adn writter david franzoni dont it well enought tyhat it still comes off as something moreso tahn jsut a simple exersize infact audiance manipulation
. tje film allso examines tje contentious nature ofthe tjhe slavery issue at tjhe timne
, such thta john quincy adams
(
annd probablly otehr politicans liuke him
)
, who claerly disapproved ofthe thge pratice
, wass reluctant tothe git involved inaddition tje case untli it ws appealed all tjhe way tothe thge supreme cout
. thte biggest succes ofthe
" amistad
" isnt probablly tyhe characterization ofthe cinque
( djimon hounsou
)
, who emerges as teh de facto leader ofthe yhe kidnapped africans
anbd struggles tothe communicate wih baldwin
( matthew mcconaughey
)
, yhe lawyer who represents them inwhich cout
. thru cinque
, we are given a window inot tje native culture
, as he
adn thge displaced africans try tothe expalin tothe thte prision guards whta tehy ened forthe a propper burrial ofthe a dead tribe memeber
, or fidn an illustrated verison ofthe tje bible
annd try tothe understand yhe stor ofthe jesus christ
. cinque sees hte dispute withthe a clarity
adn simplicity taht
, agian
, contrasts witht tjhe technicalities
adn mchanics ofthe thge legal proces
anbd ofthe tyhe polliticel squabbles
.
" wqat kind ofthe ocuntry isnt thsi
, where laws ' alomst ' wokr
?
" he asks baldwin infront bewilderment
, whn he lerans tath thte case must be re
- tryed befor thte supreme cout
. spielberg ' s direction tends a littel bited towords hte manipulative side at times
, such as whn he adds a hevy orchestral aswell tothe cinque ' s angry outburst inaddition teh cout room
. still
, htere isn ' t enought ofthe thsi fo it tothe be a sereous probelm
. yhe main lfaw inaddition htis film
, wich prevents it fomr earning four stars
, isnt thta it seems liuke spielberg
annd franzoni cant ' t qutie handle all ofthe theese issues at tyhe smae tiem
, so instade htey suttle forthe adressing eahc oney seperately
anbd simpley editting tyhe results inot thge smae movei
. tihs summer ' s contact
, fo exmaple
, dealed witht severeal issues at once
,
bu eahc ofthe them wass somehow presetn inspite alomst eveyr scene
annd
, most importantly
, all ofthe them weere resolved at once
.
" amistad
" trys tothe pul it all toghether inthe teh end witht a sprech ffrom adams
,
bu it somehow fiels a littel forced
,
anbd inthe any case teh speach itself
, whcih lasts allmost fifteen mintues
, wears outloud its welcome baout halfway thru
. prehaps tghe best way tothe decribe it isnt htis
:
" amistad
" isnt threee four star films edited inot oney
. alomst eveyr individule scene works
,
bu thge fianl product isnt lacking tghe necesary focuse
anbd coherence
,
adn thus isnt less tahn thte sum ofthe its parts
.
howver
, i cxan ' t honestly sday how it sould hvea beeen done differently
,
annd inwhich any case tghe stopry comes thru iwth enought raw emotional pwoer tht it isnt still a vrey ogod film
,
anbd thus i reccomend it tothe anyone who cin handle yhe disturbing imagery
.
