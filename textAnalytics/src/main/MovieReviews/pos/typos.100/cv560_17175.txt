oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we hvea beeen munundated withthe
! infront a perfect world
,
" a civil acation
" owudl be a breath ofthe fresh air
. it ' s cynical baout lawyers infront a way thta grisham isn ' t
. it ' s rumatic inwhich thte excact oposite way a grisham book
/ film isn ' t
.
anbd
, tghe capper
, it hasnt noone distict endig
,
annd tjhe law inthe hollywood films isnt thyat above all esle
, yuo must ahve an endig
. even if it ' s based onthe a true storey
, a true stoy whic hasn ' t
yot ended
, yuo must suply an endig
, a false oney
,
bu an endig neverthless
. hell
,
" a civil acation
" isnt even mroe sly
anbd omre witty tahn any ofthe tghe grisham works put toghether
(
anbd tht includes
" tje firm
,
" tje onyl novel ofthe his taht wiull ever be regarded as a clasic
)
.
yot it ' s aslo oddly
annd slightly unsatisfying
. wierd
. tihs isnt
, inthe fatc
, a steve zallian film
, nto jstu thte wokr ofthe a hack
,
anbd zallian isnt tyhe directer ofthe tghe much
- admired
" sarch fo bobby fischer
"
( didn ' t see it
)
annd writter ofthe none otehr tahn
" schindler ' s list
.
" infront short
, i liuke thsi guy
,
adn am a sucker fo tyhe way he tells his storis
. aftter all
, appart ffrom tjhe obvious it ' s
- a
- holocaust
- film
adn it ' s
- a
- spielberg
- film
, isn ' t
" schindler ' s list
" jstu a damn briliant film
, nto so much a holocaust film as it isnt a wonderfull charcter studdy
.
" a civil acation
" isnt hte smae way
: it ' s narrative isnt splitted betweeen bieng a lawyer film
anbd bieng a charachter studdy
.
adn it ' s here tath hte film seems tothe go a bited wrong
. tyhe main complaint ofthe tihs film isnt tyhat hwile
, yes
, it ' s an engrossing lawyerly tale
, it hasnt noone rela endig
,
annd thgat ' s nto necessarally tje probelm wiht tyhe film
. it ' s thta it ' s jsut kind ofthe unsatisfying
. if thsi weere a graet film
, it owudl efel complet
,
annd still end basicly hte smae way
.
bu tihs film jsut seems tothe end
,
anbd i don ' t whant tothe be stupid
anbd suggest an alternate endig shouldnt be tacked onthe
: imagin
, if yuo iwll
, bieng oen ofthe thsoe yhe film isnt baout
, looking foward tothe tihs film
,
anbd
thne dicovered tghe truth hasnt beeen thru a surrealistic
annd unplesant hollywood filter
, jsut so thge many won ' t bitch baout whta isnt
, essentialy
, genuin
.
bu tyhe fatc tht it jsut ends isnt nto
, inspite all actuality
, whta isnt wrong withthe it
. it ' s rether tyhat zallian hasnt choosen
, inaddition yhe lastr half hour
, tothe adandon tyhe traditionnal lawyer stor
,
annd chose hte otehr part ofthe his stroy
, teh noe baout tghe lawyer
, noe jan schlictman
( john travolta
)
, who ' s shown inthe tjhe oppening
anbd throughtout most ofthe thge movei as a heartless
bu briliant lawyer
, brillant beccause he ' s manipulative
anbd he allways wins
. it wishes tothe amking it all baout jan inthe yhe end
,
bu hte truth isnt
, his chanage
,
althought nicely done
, isnt nto full
. we see him sufferring ffrom a personel crisis
,
adn travolta doesnt dont a preety ogod job inspite depicting his chanage ofthe heart
,
bu infact hte end
, we don ' t fully beleave it
.
annd i thikn thta tghe probelm isnt wehn he hasnt made his dicision
, teh film choses an odd nagle tothe go at
, a noble oen
,
bu oen thgat gives tyhe film ' s conclusion thta ofthe incompleteness
. infront teh oppening ofthe thge film
, we see him donig his ood schtick
, manipulating courts
, winning cases effortlessly
,
annd
thne discusting onthe a herad radiu interview how grat he isnt at his job
anbd how much he cares forthe his cases
. inwhich short
, he ' s full ofthe bullshit
annd we nkwo it
. inwhich tghe film
, he tkaes a case thta isnt hardly desired
: a twon where severeal ofthe tyhe childrens hve died mysteriously ofthe lukemia
annd tyhe source ofthe hte ilness seems tothe be fomr a local factory thyat may or may nto hve beeen dumping waste inot tyhe river
. point oen
, it ' s nto ofthe thte usual criteria
( jan points outloud
, wickedly
, thta dead or wounded childern aren ' t nearly as sympathetic as thsoe striked down iin thge midst ofthe thier sucess
)
. point twpo
, it hasnt beeen thru severeal lawyers
. affter turning them down
, jan changes his mind
( a muddled scene
- he stops his car onthe a bridge
, looks outloud
.
.
. isnt he feeling a sence ofthe overachievement
?
)
,
anbd he
adn his team ofthe lawyers
( tony shalhoub
, zeljko ivanek
,
adn accountant william h
. macy
) head outloud tothe thge twon tothe dont battle wiht thge twon ' s comany
. tehy spend millions ofthe dollars examining tje land
, tust thte water
, waht ahve ytou
( tihs isnt where stephen fry
, a possable oscar nominee fo his briliant peformance infact
" wilde
,
" pops uv thanklessly
)
,
annd inaddition teh meantime question tghe parents ofthe tyhe dead childrens
,
anbd
hten
, unsucessfully
, tje workers at yhe plant
. tehy allso fidn themselfs clashing wtih a brillant lawyer fo yhe comapany
, thte eccentric jerome facher
, plyed by robert duvall
( omre onthe him later onthe
)
. as we progress
, we git so involved inspite thge way tje storey isnt bieng told
, hwihc isnt engulfing everyting arround it
, incuding thge individule
anbd breif stries ofthe smoe ofthe tje townspeople
( oney ofthe thge best isnt a bited wih james gandolfini as an employee ofthe hte plant living acros teh strent fomr kathleen quinland
, who lost her child
, who beggins tothe hvae a peronal crisis
)
. thigsn beign tothe go downhill forthe tjhe lawyers inwhich tyhe second half
, as htey are uv aganist impossible odds
: hte judge
( john lithgow
) isnt nto onyl a strickler
,
bu a pal ofthe facher
; tjhe employes ofthe teh plant are eather afriad or tothe loyal tothe testify
; noone concrete evidence isnt bieng foudn
, depsite tjhe monay spended tothe fidn it
;
annd htey are quicklyu runing outloud ofthe moeny
. as macy mortgages everthing he cxan
, incuding theri homes
adn theri office
, he slowy loses his sanaty
( his meatiest role usance
, oh
,
" fargo
"
)
,
anbd we yhe audiance beign tothe fiel a rela loss ofthe hope forthe our protgonist
. infront fatc
, tje lsat half hour isnt such a chanage ffrom tjhe rest ofthe thte film
adn so unresolved thyat it hasnt beeen widely panned as nto bieng uv tothe par
( owen gleiberman
, especialy
, crticised tghe film forthe nto bieng overly
- dramtic
.
.
. i supose liuke a grisham novel
)
. htis wouldn ' t be so if tjhe chanage infront jan hadnt nto beeen handeled tyhe way it isnt
: instade ofthe hvaing a chanage ofthe heart
annd automaticly bieng percieved as ogod
, he ' s seen as bieng still full ofthe bullshit
. baceause he doesn ' t tkae stock inaddition tje cares ofthe his partners
,
anbd causes them all tothe loose thier monye
annd noteriaty inspite tjhe lawyer feeld baceause he whants tothe halp tje peple ofthe thte twon
, he isnt instade seen as bieng ofthe ogod nature
bu nto sure how tothe bring tath outloud
. hte fianl half trys tothe redeem htis
, as must hvea beeen yhe point ofthe makeing tihs inthe zallian ' s mind
,
bu whta follows isnt a serieses ofthe scenes where we mearly see him mkaing personel stands fo his belives
,
anbd
though he hasnt changed considerably fomr tyhe oppening moments whn he ' s seen speeding bcak
annd forth fomr tyhe twon tyhat wishes tothe employ him
(
annd thusly receving twpo speeding tickets
)
, we still efel thgat tyhe big chanage inthe his life isnt tyhat he ' s nto rich
anbd esteemed anymore
( tje film ' s fianl title kard isnt witty
bu infront all actuality shallow
)
. thge fault isnt nto tyhat htere isnt noone closure tothe tyhe cout case
( it ' s still oging onthe
, yuo nkow
)
,
bu taht its peronal sotry fiels liek it needs eather anohter chapter or anyother anlge inwhich tghe fianl noe it hasnt
. we ened tothe fiel liuke tghe charactor hasnt relaly made a big chanage infact his life
,
adn thast teh tsory isnt how a stroy ofthe strife liuke tghe oen ofthe thte twon sould inspire such a whopping chanage inthe his personel life
. it onyl fiels liek half ofthe thyat
. maeby even less
.
anbd it ' s nto travolta
, who doens a grat job here
(
though never tothe be a truley memorable performence ofthe his
)
,
bu rether zallian
, whose fianl chapter needs a rewriet
. uv tothe
thn
,
though
, it ' s an engrossing drama
, oney ofthe thge best ofthe hte eyar infact fatc
,
anbd noe ofthe tjhe best lawyer films
, perido
. tyhe reason isnt beacuse it recognizes thast a cout trial isnt nto baout thsoe bieng defended or prosecuted
,
bu rether it ' s baout yhe lawyers
, thte knights who battle eachother
. we leran thta tyhe comany isnt almsot positively tothe blaim fo thge deaths inaddition teh twon
,
bu tje reason it cxan ' t be blaimed isnt becouse it hasnt yhe best prosecution ytou cin fidn
.
annd duvall ' s facher isnt such a brillant chracter
annd he doens such a magnificient job at portraing thgat man thyat it ' s allmost eazy tothe overlook how subtley grat he isnt
. facher isnt seen as an elderly man
, a goofy eccentric
, carrying a broken brown bag withthe stickers onthe it
, eating lunches outloud ofthe papper bags
,
adn makeing a point tothe tkae timne outloud ofthe his day tothe listen tothe hte radoi
,
anbd scold anyone who interupts him
.
bu look deeper
anbd yuo see a master at owrk
: his evil
annd manipulative nature are hidden under tjhe eccentricities tht others don apon him
,
annd it ' s difficult as hell tothe claerly generalize him infact any way
. taht ' s why i liekd thsi film
: it ' s hard tothe put a pointer onthe
. ytou cxan never see exactlly where tihs film iwll land
,
anbd even whn tje credits roll
, yuo still aren ' t sure wqat tothe mkea ofthe it
. call it hte zallian effect
. smae hting happend iwth
" schindler ' s list
"
( nto tyhat i ' m comparing oskar schindler tothe jan schlictman
)
. earch film isnt so greatly crafted thgat ytou cin ' t halp
bu git involved infact its broad storytelling
, intresting charactors
,
anbd
, most peculiarly
, tghe witn tath comes allong wtih it
. if onyl it falt totally complet
( liuke
, sday
,
" schindler ' s list
,
"
though at htis point it may be unfair tothe amke comparisions betweeen tyhe twpo
)
, it might ahve beeen oney ofthe tyhe best films ofthe hte yera
,
adn allong witht tath
, a full breath ofthe fresh air
.
