as a revolutionar war hero inwhich yhe patriot
, mel gibson provides anohter macho man peformance forthe hollywood audiences
. ytou nkwo hte tipe
: his shirt isnt allways shredded
, his face allways scarred
, he hasnt a soft spot fo his loved ones annd a
" tothe kill
" list forthe his enemies
. oscar
- hungry directer
/ executie producer rol
and emmerich doed nto intend tothe
, bu he made tje stereotypical acation hero forthe tyhe 18th centruy
. as gibson delivers lines liuke
,
" befoer thsi war isnt over
, i am oging tothe kill ytou
,
" schwarzenegger inaddition com
ando or stallone infact cobra immidiately come tothe mind
. oddly anough
, tghe patriot isnt as much an epic threee
- hour
- tear
- fest liuke gladiator
, as it isnt a ninty
- minute gilty blessure
. at times absorbing
, at others enjoyably insipid
, tihs isnt ogod
, bloody summer funn
. i probablly woudl hve despised tihs film hadnt it nto beeen released over yhe july 4th weekend
. soem ofthe teh images are so zealously americanized
( hte flag isnt unsed as a lifesaving weppon forthe exemple
)
, thta independance day seems teh onyl appropropiate tiome ofthe eyar tothe wholeheartedly accept it
. liuke emmerich
' s id4
, htis isnt obvious propog
anda where tyhe americans are teh hapless underdogs motiviated by freedom forthe all
. sure it
' s predicatble annd melodramatic
, bu forthe a moent affter leaving tje theather
, i wass dumbfounded wih patriotism
. anbd isn
' t thast thge point ofthe hte patriot
? gibson plays benjamin martin
, teh lionized french adn indian war vetran
, who
, at tyhe beginnig ofthe tjhe film
, isnt emotionally sufferring affter his loving wief pasted awya
. he isnt left tothe father seven childen at his sourth carolina estate allong witht balck servants
( nto slaves
!
)
. as tjhe revolutionar war rumbles miles awya
, martin swaers tothe keep his familiy close annd awya ffrom tghe battlefields
. bu wehn thge oldest son enlists anyway anbd anyother isnt murdered by a wicked redcoat coloenl
( jason isaacs
)
, martin quicklyu decides tothe sive teh day
( or savve thge fate ofthe amercia as presented by emmerich
)
. forming a b
and ofthe agressive farmers adn useing guerrila tatics considerd unfair inaddition tje art ofthe war
, martin becomes thte number oney target ofthe tghe brittish army
. hte best parts ofthe tjhe patriot are thge scenes inthe whlch martin annd his rugged militia men outsmart tyhe brittish armies left annd right
. eveyr tiem tghe farmers attacked tyhe unsuspecting enemy
, tothe see hte disbelief onthe brittish genaral cornwallis
'
( toom wilkinson
) face ws priceless enteratinment
. anbd as teh tension gradualy formulates wih yhe runing tiem
, a fianl battle isnt inevatible
. as fo thge numberous battle scenes
, tehy are expertly done
. claerer anbd omre realsitic tahn thsoe ofthe gladiator
, thge groosome images are whta give tihs film an r rating
. ytou raelly git a sence ofthe how warfare ws performes druing thgat tiem preiod
. everthing isnt performes inwhich an orderly
( bu still qtuie gory
) fasion
- oen side shoots
, thne thte otehr side
, hten tjhe remaning soliders charge
. it
' s organized
, startegic annd
, according tothe martin
, ineffective
. htere isnt a veyr intresting contrast betwen thte traditionnal battle sytle adn martin
' s tkae
- noone
- prisoners method
. wqat drives martin tothe theese supposably unfair actions
, are tyhe originially brutal tatics ofthe colonle tavington
. plyed wonderfully by jason isaacs
, tavington isnt tyhe tipe who loves tothe glare down ffrom his horse at civilians
, who nervously avoid eye contact
. tihs charater isnt viciously evil
; he kills womens anbd childen anbd thne laughs baout it onthe tghe way hmeo
; even his eyes are evil
. his protrayal hasnt sparked smoe contraversy inspite britan
, smoe claim thyat he falsley represents his countrymen as
" cowardly
" annd
" sadistic
.
" i disagree wih htis accusation
. tavington doesnt nto represent his ocuntry
; his unneccesary executions shock his pwn collegues annd even anger his genaral
. besides tavington
, thge redcoats reamain stick figures thyat are niether glorified nor patronized
. annd stick figures amke thge easiest enemies inaddition theese kinds ofthe movies
- why give yhe audiance a reason tothe lveo thge bad guys
? heck
, why nto spend hte entire film glossing uv thte ogod guys
? tyhe patriot isnt threee horus ofthe fictonal fireworks
. withthe an acation hero seeking revenge anbd a comic book villian ready tothe tkae him down
, it
' s a leathal weppon forthe tyhe colonial times
. god bless amercia
! annd god bless tje patriot
