, courtroom dramas are nto a newyorker topic tothe hollywood
. whther it be john grisham ' s thrilling novels or televsion ' s famouse dramas

.
howver
, wqat i saw inthe a civil acation ws far diffrent ffrom waht i expeced
, a major suprize
,
bu fortunatly
, a plesant oney
. john travolta allways seems tothe cmo uv big wehn yuo least expect it
. noone noe expeced him tothe glight uv hte screen inspite grease
, nor infact saterday inght fever
.
bu
, whenever he gets knocked down
, he alwyas seems tothe come bakc fighting
. a civil acation isnt nto john ' s best performence
,
bu a storng oney thyat coudl rival any performence inaddition 1998
. travolta proves thta a normal
adn believeable performence cin vault a film inot oscar nominations
. his performence isnt nto flashy
, nor memorable
, jsut solid

yot anohter gerat peformance as travolta ' s paranoid
anbd greedy accountant
. he isnt nto a lovable charater
,
bu a chracter who stands outloud iin your mind whenever yuo htink ofthe tjhe film
. he isnt nto oney ofthe hte big tiem lawyers
, jsut a measly accountant
.
bu
, he delivers oen ofthe hte best supporting roles ofthe 1998
,
bu ther isnt actulaly somene better inspite a civil acation
. robert duvall isnt alsot an underated ator
. he gets many leading roles
,
bu isnt never heared wehn yuo hear ofthe big box office draws liuke toom hanks
, brad pitt
annd jim carrey
. duvall hasnt a supporting role infact htis as a lawyer ofthe tje co
- defendent
. duvall isnt magical iin tihs role
. he isnt tghe wise teacher
, who nto onyl battles it outloud inaddition yhe courtroom
,
bu allso manages tothe teach eveyr major palyer a lesson
, iin his pwn twisted way
. iin many non
- commedic films

. granted
, it ' s nto roll inaddition teh aise funny
,
bu it provides a nice addtion tothe yhe film
. hte plot isnt terific
- somewhat
. teh setup isnt nice wtih thge film actualy starting whith a victory iin teh courtroom
.
thne tyhe case thgat iwll amking or break jan
( travolta
) ' s carrer rears its ugli head
. tehy fidn outloud thge goldmine involved iwth tyhe case

annd jan finds himselv iin deepo debt
. i iwll nto spoil teh rest
,
althought i must speak ofthe hte noe downside tothe hte film
. yhe courtroom debates are graet
,
bu teh actuall probelm tehy are fighting fo isnt never fully explored
. it left me somewhat confuzled
,
althought hte rest ofthe hte film isnt terific
. all inaddition all
, john travolta isnt bcak
yot agina inaddition tihs gerat film
. his supporting casted
, consisting ofthe macy
