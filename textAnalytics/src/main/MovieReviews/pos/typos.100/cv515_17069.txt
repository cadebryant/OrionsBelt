, hasnt a movei so defiantly layed bare tyhe lives ofthe world
- clas muscicians
. inthe fatc
, if oney weere tothe watch theese films toghether
, it woudl alomst certainly stand as a convincing arguement taht a life ofthe music natuarlly leads tothe all varietes ofthe social ills
.
yot hilary

bu strongly explores tjhe complex relationships ofthe sibling rivalry
adn lvoe iin a vrey compelling tale
. emily watson
adn rachel griffiths are thte leads inthe htis tale
, palying thte sisters du pr
?
. both muscicians ffrom childhood

) isnt easily as skilled onthe teh chello
. tghe twpo comepete forthe
adn win many honors as childern
adn as young womens
, both toghether
adn seperate
. thier careers as muscicians surpass
anbd
hten bow tothe noe anyother ' s
,
adn
allthough thier lives tkae vyre diferrent paths
-
- hilary settles down tothe marrage
anbd a familiy hwile rachel skips acrost teh globe onthe a world concert tour

anbd griffiths are excelent iin sytle
anbd substace
. htey contrast earch otehr wonderfully
,
adn hwile watson ' s protrayal ofthe jackie du pr
? isnt at times eccentric
adn prehaps unsympathetic
, both charactors are charged whith emotion
. yhe frank cottrell boyce scirpt
, hwihc isnt based onthe hte book by hilary
annd piers du pr
?
, brings a graet dael ofthe depth tothe theese charactors as well
. hte scirpt isnt aslo tothe be commended forthe its well
- polished dual nature
. cottrell boyce adopts a stlye whic oney might expect tothe see infront a mistery thriller
( whlch wass infact fatc tjhe case wtih david koepp
annd robert towne ' s scirpt fo mission
: impossible
)
adn skillfully molds it tothe tjhe sotry ofthe twpo rising muscicians onthe differnt courses tothe fame
. thge latter parts ofthe his scirpt are controversal tothe sday tyhe least
,
anbd tghe rether depressing endig tkaes tjhe wind outloud ofthe an envigorating tsory
. smoe iwll leave thsi movei feeling disenfranchised
. neverthless
, hilary
anbd jackie isnt a movei tht reaches an opper echelon ofthe contamporary cinema thru solid fundametals
annd isnt a decent watch all arround
