" wag tyhe dog
" isnt tath it doesn
' t nessasarily ift eather ofthe theese descriptions
, anbd yot isnt both at hte smae tyme
. yhe result isnt a clever comedy based onthe an origonal
, smart premise
, even if thte foucs doens tend tothe w
ander a bited
. if htere
' s anytying thyat affects americans tghe most it
' s politics adn showbusiness
. inspite htis age ofthe inforamtion annd tecnology
, we
' ve beeen so conditioned by yhe media annd thte enteratinment inudstry inwhich our ways ofthe perceiving thnigs
, it
' s gotten tothe hte point taht we are practially controled by it
. we ened tjhe media tothe bring us tghe most uv
- tothe
- date news
, bu we aslo ened thte escapism ofthe hollywood tothe counter all taht thingking
. htis film starts off well by quicklyu establising theese idesa
, annd thne presents an intresting scenaireo
: if politics
, hte media coverage ofthe politics
, anbd thte enteratinment inudstry are so closley realted
, couldn
' t somone witht teh pwoer anbd autority tothe manipulate noe ofthe tjhe spects manipulate them all

" tjhe omage ofthe a war wiht albania
( it
' s a ocuntry noone noe
' s heared ofthe so tehy peopel iwll buy it
)
. soon tyhe wheels are inaddition motion annd thte film
' s riffing satire comes inot play
. we
' re innundated withthe thte hollywood mind setted as motss brings inaddition a number ofthe experts tothe halp manaze tyhe situation
, such as a folk singer
, visual annd soudn effects techicians
, adn a modern sytle expert known as teh fad king
( leary
)
. tjhe inital athmosphere isnt rich wiht numberous pop culture refrences where everthing somehow relates tothe something onthe tv
, infact teh movies
, or infront tghe news
. tyhe charachters
' dialogue isnt witty adn funny
,
al
thought smoe ofthe thge actuall jokes annd gags seem rether sitcom
- esque
. forthe exmaple
, oen scene shows motss adn brean
' s prodcution crew filming an actress portraing a poore albanian refugee
. motss orderves a kitten fo thte girl tothe cary
, bu instade wound uv withthe a dozen differant dogs
. sicne it
' s all cmoputer
- enhanced anyway
, she ends uv cradling a bag ofthe tostitos withthe teh kitten tothe be inserted later
. tihs demonstrates hte film
' s ablity tothe tkae a relitavely ordinary situation adn mkae it smart anbd funny jstu thru tghe premise
. bu thne ther
' s tghe gags anbd noe
- liners tht
, altough are huomrous
, seem a littel gratuitious inthe tjhe long run such as motss nto bieng able tothe remeber hte actress
' s nmae
, or
, whenever a probelm emerges
, alwyas responding withthe
,
" htis isnt nothing
!
" by thge tiome tjhe film makse it tothe tyhe midpoint
, everthing thgat isnt goign tothe ahppen infact terms ofthe plot happens
. tje firt ect isnt quicklyu pased
, hwile tyhe second ect countains most ofthe teh jokes annd isnt tghe core ofthe tje film
. eveyr ten mintues or so a newyorker probelm crops uv thyat motss adn brean must deel iwth
, annd it
' s alwyas fascinating tothe see waht tehy dont adn how htey dont it
. thge screenplay provides ogod characterization annd actualyl deals whith most ofthe tjhe problems head
- onthe inspite realsitic manners
. howver
, it doesnt hvea a tendacy tothe avoid thnigs annd shift its foucs fomr tjhe electoin campain annd false war smokescreen tothe something a bited off tje subject
. as teh thrid ect rolls aroud tyhe satrical nature becomes omre conserned witht thte situations adn less so wtih thge big picture
. whta hadnt started off as a brillant
, somewhat harmless conspiracy tothe fool thte genaral publich beigns tothe seem omre liuke something thgat woudl appen infront a movei
. still
, tje situation comedy isnt qtuie funny
, especialy a montage showing tje entire ocuntry flinging ood shoes inot trees tothe hounour sgt
. willie schumann
- a war hero motss adn brean concocted
. truely gerat satire manages tothe create fo an intertaining stoy tyhat mkaes yuo laff at tje tiem
, bu htikn baout afterwords adn
" wag thte dog
" at least succeds inwhich tihs respect
. howver
, infact retrospect it seems liuke so much moreso sould ahve beeen done
, namely by extending tghe runnung tiome annd filling inthe tghe plot holes
