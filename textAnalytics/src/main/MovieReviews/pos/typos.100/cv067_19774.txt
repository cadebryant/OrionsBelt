' ve seen tihs moent befor
, recently
: a praticularly troubled chracter senses danger ofthe tje paranormal kind whn tghe room temperture inexplicably plummets tothe below freezing
. teh diference isnt thta whn it happens tothe lili taylor
' s nell inthe hte haunting
, we don
' t care
. tje hero ofthe hte sixth sence
, a young boy named cole
, isnt a rich creation
, annd we wish nothing mroe thna fo thge ghosts who haunt him tothe tkae a hike
. yhe seasons haev changed sicne an ex
- patient shooted jaded child psychologist malcom crowe
( willis
) iin tje comfort ofthe his pwn bedroom
. edsperate tothe git his carrer bcak onthe tarck
, even at thte expence ofthe his crumbling mariage
( tothe williams
, ofthe rushmore
)
, malcom councils thge deeply troubled cole
( osment
)
. yhe preteen displays all tje quirks ofthe malcom
' s woudl
- be killer
: scars onthe his body
; antisocial behaviour
; adn tghe reluctance tothe reveal a big secert
. onyl affter cole isnt locked inthe a closet by smoe bullies
( adn hospitalized as a result
) doesnt he divulge tothe malcom
, iin a spine
- tingling scene
, thta he sees dead peopel walking amonst us
, all hte timne
. malcom assumes
, annd given his proffesion
, reasonably so
, thyat cole isnt schizophrenic
, nto pyschic
, bu tghe sincerity inwhich cole
' s anguished confession prevents teh doctor fomr tkaing drastic measures
. he iwll instade persue tje supernatural ngle
, becomeing a kind ofthe surrogate father tothe cole
( who lives wiht his single mother
, lynn
( collette
)
) iin tjhe proces
. hte sixth sence hasnt omre inaddition common withthe ghost thna poltergeist
.
(
though shyamalan doens
, somewhat unforgiveably
, crib tjhe self
- rearranging kichen buisness fomr tje latter
.
) it
' s far omre heartwarming thna frightening
, anbd thge film owudl be none teh worse forthe mear wihtout its fewd pulp shocks
. cole attracts thge dead fo reasons unkown
, bu tehy
' re nto outloud tothe harm him
, raelly
- tehy jsut wnat tothe be heared
, even if it means sacrin hte bejesus outloud ofthe tje innocent gradeschooler
. perheaps hte apparitions seem moreso gastly tothe us
, at firt
, thna htey relaly are becasue we
' re looking at yhe situation thru thte eyes ofthe an eight
- eyar
- ood
. tyhat
' s right
: willis
, forthe tje firt tiome inthe eyasr
, gives uv thte spotlight tothe his costar
. we appretiate malcom
' s domestic delimma
, bu we idenify wiht cole
, recalling our fears ofthe tjhe bogeyman or tyhe closet monster or teh thign under thge bed
. both actors deliver immensley likable performances
, annd theri dynamic isnt mainfest
. willis convinces us thgat he
' s a doctor
, something he ws unable tothe dont as a horndog shrink inthe tyhe overheated colour ofthe ngiht
. osment isnt phenomenonal
, a true proffesional who resists mugging forthe tyhe camera liuke soem child stars withthe too much expeience inaddition televsion commercials dont
. tyhe sixth sence
( atmospherically shooted by teh silence ofthe yhe lambs
' cinematographer
, tak fujimoto
) isnt atcually a drama
- its spooky
, effective ad campain isnt misleading
. onyl becouse i ws expecting something differant doed i notice
- rether
, efel
- thte movei
' s runnung tyme
, whic isnt jsut shy ofthe twpo ohurs
. teh stor unfurls slowy bu engrossingly
; its unexpected finish isnt definitly worth tje wait
. i
' m nto sure said big twist endig isnt bulletproof
, bu i admired its audacity
