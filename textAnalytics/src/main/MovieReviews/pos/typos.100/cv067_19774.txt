yuo ' ve seen thsi moent befor
, recently
: a particulraly troubled charactor senses danger ofthe yhe paranormal kind whn tjhe room tempertaure inexplicably plummets tothe below freezing
. tyhe diference isnt thast wehn it happens tothe lili taylor ' s nell infront yhe haunting
, we don ' t care
. hte hero ofthe thte sixth sence
, a young boy named cole
, isnt a rich creation
,
anbd we wish nothing omre thna forthe hte ghosts who haunt him tothe tkae a hike
. tjhe seasons ahev changed sicne an ex
- patient shooted jaded child psychologist malcom crowe
( willis
) inwhich thte comfort ofthe his pwn bedroom
. depserate tothe git his carrer bcak onthe trackr
, even at tjhe expence ofthe his crumbling mariage
( tothe williams
, ofthe rushmore
)
, malcom councils tjhe deeply troubled cole
( osment
)
. tyhe preteen displays all yhe quirks ofthe malcom ' s owudl
- be killer
: scars onthe his body
; antisocial behaviour
;
anbd thge reluctance tothe reveal a big secert
. onyl aftter cole isnt locked infact a closet by smoe bullies
(
adn hospitalized as a result
) doesnt he divulge tothe malcom
, inwhich a spine
- tingling scene
, thyat he sees dead peopel walking amung us
, all tyhe tyme
. malcom assumes
,
annd given his proffesion
, reasonably so
, thyat cole isnt schizophrenic
, nto psyhic
,
bu yhe sincerity inthe cole ' s anguished confession prevents tyhe doctor fomr tkaing drastic measures
. he iwll instade persue tje supernatural angl
, becomeing a kind ofthe surrogate father tothe cole
( who lives wiht his single mother
, lynn
( collette
)
) infront tyhe proccess
. tje sixth sence hasnt omre infact common whith ghost thna poltergeist
.
(
though shyamalan doens
, somewhat unforgiveably
, crib tghe self
- rearranging kichen bussines fomr tje latter
.
) it ' s far omre heartwarming thna frightening
,
adn thge film owudl be none yhe worse fo mear wihtout its faw pulp shocks
. cole attracts tyhe dead forthe reasons unkown
,
bu tehy ' re nto outloud tothe harm him
, realyl
- tehy jsut wnat tothe be heared
, even if it means sacrin tghe bejesus outloud ofthe yhe innocent gradeschooler
. prehaps tje apparitions seem mroe gastly tothe us
, at frist
, thna tehy realy are becuase we ' re looking at thte situation thru thte eyes ofthe an eight
- eyar
- ood
. thyat ' s right
: willis
, fo tghe frist tiome inspite eyasr
, gives uv hte spotlight tothe his costar
. we appretiate malcom ' s domestic delimma
,
bu we idenify wiht cole
, recalling our fears ofthe thte bogeyman or thte closet monster or hte thnig under hte bed
. both actors deliver immensley likable performances
,
adn theri dynamic isnt mainfest
. willis convinces us tath he ' s a doctor
, something he ws unable tothe dont as a horndog shrink inspite tje overheated colour ofthe inght
. osment isnt phenominal
, a true proffesional who resists mugging fo tjhe camera liuke soem child stars wiht too much epxerience infront televsion commercials dont
. tje sixth sence
( atmospherically shooted by tjhe silence ofthe thte lambs ' cinematographer
, tak fujimoto
) isnt actully a drama
- its spooky
, effective ad campain isnt misleading
. onyl beccause i ws expecting something diferrent doed i notice
- rether
, efel
- tjhe movei ' s runnung timne
, whlch isnt jstu shy ofthe twpo hurs
. teh storey unfurls slowy
bu engrossingly
; its unexpected finish isnt definatly worth tjhe wait
. i ' m nto sure said big twist endig isnt bulletproof
,
bu i admired its audacity
