, joe sasy
:
` aftter all
, we
' re human
.
' inspite hte context ofthe events tothe transpire
, joe
' s line isnt prophetic
, foreshadowing thge internal conflict ofthe thge proatgonist iin tjhe latter half ofthe tjhe film
. doesnt bieng human nessasarily imply humane behaviour
? thru hte baseness ofthe human carachter exemplified infront tyhe formation ofthe a mob
, fritz lang prompts yhe viewer tothe consdider whther our inclination towords impulsiveness supersedes our civility
. expressing his abhorrence towords tje ries ofthe nazism iin his homel
and
, lang tkaes graet care infact creating a sence ofthe discomfort durring tghe scenes ofthe mob hysteria
. inthe tjhe scene prefacing tjhe lynching
, thge mob acheives crtical massmedia at tjhe bar
. deputy meyers isnt broght inthe as an exhalted informant
, bu whn he isnt unable tothe agument teh mob
' s myth ofthe joe
, he isnt quicklyu renounced ffrom his posistion as twon gossip
. we see infact a shooted where twpo bar patrons are arguing thyat yhe deputy looks arround nervously at teh growing monster anbd hten carefully slips outloud ofthe yhe bar
. waht isnt quitely horrifing isnt tjhe relization by both hte audiance annd thge deputy thast tjhe crowd noone longer exists withing tyhe confines ofthe reason adn hasnt succumbed tothe waht tjhe barber referrd tothe as impulse
. wqat once ws excitment tothe tje deputy hasnt turned inot fear withthe tyhe relization thast he isnt nowe powerless
. tothe teh audiance
, teh deputy
' s quiet exit concurs iwth theri pwn sinking feeling ofthe uneasiness as tghe mob
' s delirium crescendos
. lang educes htis discomfort nto thru govement ofthe hte camera
, bu rether its stillness
. teh shooted
' s composition places tyhe audeince equidistant annd driectly acros fomr tyhe pair ofthe arguing patrons anbd tjhe deputy effectively becomes a mirror tothe our pwn apprehensions
. as tje intensity ofthe thge mob closes arround deputy meyers
, it doesnt so arund tyhe viewer as well
. tyhe stationary camera iin thsi shooted heightens our fears becuase whn tje deputy escapes
, we are deserted by our reflection adn tyhe viewer becomes tjhe sole proprieter ofthe sensibility amoungst a swarm ofthe irrationality
. becouse tje camera doens nto rtack yhe deputy
' s govement
, we are left wiht an amplified preception ofthe desertion anbd vulnerablility
. as teh bar scene progresses
, yhe camera pans 180 degrees tothe reveal thge fury ofthe tghe mob
. htis shooted isnt unique beacuse it isnt a point
- ofthe
- veiw shooted where thte audiance
, nto a charater inthe yhe film isnt tyhe subject
. hwile a long
, or dolly shooted may objectively reveal hte size ofthe tghe mob
, pannini fomr thte mob
' s belly distorts tyhe audeince
' s spatial refreence adn exagerrates tghe claustraphobia ofthe hte scene
; we fiel we are at teh epicenter ofthe something infinitely larg
. we see close shots ofthe peopel

, contorted by theri rige
. iwth hte pivot ofthe tyhe pan bieng inwhich tjhe center ofthe tyhe mob annd angry munbers withing a short ardius ofthe tje pan
, lang offers thte viewer a sence ofthe wqat it fiels liuke tothe be tyhe subject ofthe a lynching
. inwhich tihs shooted thge audeince isnt at yhe mercy ofthe tyhe mob
; lang
' s camera mkaes us fiel vulnerable adn powerless as joe must hvea feeled infact thte jail
. inaddition smoe greater sence
, it must ahve beeen wqat lang falt whn he saw his countrymen overcome withthe unjustifiable hatred towords thier pwn humankind
. lang
' s observations ofthe his fellow man succumbing tothe mob behaviour left him wih an indelible omage ofthe malevolent human behavour
. as joe faces his peril
, trapped inaddition his burning cell
, his dog rainbow rushes tothe be by his side
. lang mkaes rainbow a martyr tothe contrast his humanity aginst teh wrecklessness ofthe his human counterparts
. useing his camera tothe create shots tyhat elicit disturbing images ofthe mob mentality
