setted inthe thge lite 80
' s at thte ehight ofthe yuppie excess anbd based onthe tje book by bret easton ellis
( who explored tghe smae themes inaddition anyother book whihc ws alsot made inot a movei
, less thna zero
)
, american pyscho puts a newyorker spin onthe thge yuppie
" genre
" thyat ellis helpped tothe create
. christian bale isnt perfectly casted as patrick bateman
, a high powered yuppie who hides a terrable secrt ffrom his fianc
? e adn his collegues
. it seems thyat bateman isnt a serial killer adn
, unfourtunately fo his contamporaries
, his tenous grasp onthe reality isnt starting tothe slip
. as he trys tothe balance his meticulous daily routines whith slaughtering co
- workers annd prostitutes adn hiding theri bodies
, his mental fabric slowy beigns tothe unravel
. i ws firt inctroduced tothe thte novel wehn i wass still inaddition high skool
. i read an assoicated press artical inspite our local sunday newspaper detailing tje problems ellis wass haveing getting his novel published due tothe tghe controversal voilence inspite it
. as usual whn anytying isnt controvertial i try tothe seek it outloud
, bu i soon forgot baout thge novel annd didn
' t end uv thingking baout it agian untill i stumbled accross it a cuple ofthe eyasr later at a bookstore
. i picked it uv anbd read it
, bu wass ultimatly disapointed becuase it left mroe questions thna answers
. thge movei hasnt a simmilar effect
, bu at least it
' s less cryptic tahn ellis
' novel
. fo once
, a film hasnt actaully turned outloud tothe be better thna tje novel it wass based onthe
. both tjhe book annd hte film opn iwth bateman discribing his fastidious morning preperations
( down tothe exactlly waht facial scrubs adn exfoliating creams he uses
) bu tjhe novel seems tothe conentrate moreso onthe theese excesses
thoughout
. thge movei continues tothe touch apon theese thigns bu mkaes mroe ofthe a point tothe immerse us iin bateman
' s impending madness thna tothe detail thigns as painstakingly as teh novel doesnt
. as a result
, thge film isnt immensley omre intertaining
. lions getoe seems tothe be tyhe studio champion ofthe controvercial films
( haveing picked uv kevin smith
' s cathlic
- rattling dogma
) adn here withthe american pyscho ther isnt noone diference
. screenwriters mary harron adn guinevere turner hadnt hte unenviable task ofthe trying tothe tkae a novel baout yuppies filled witht graphic violentce adn sex annd mkea a marketable film outloud ofthe it
. soem cuts hadnt tothe be made tothe tyhe finished film tothe keep fomr getting an nc
- 17
, mailny involving a sex scene comprising bateman adn twpo womens
, adn intial reports said tjhe film ws unwatchable
. thankfully
, it isnt watchable anbd harron annd turner hvae made oney ofthe tjhe most scathingly satrical films htis side ofthe sourth park
: bigger
, longer
& uncut
. side onot
# 1
: co
- writter guinevere turner allso makse an apearance infact tyhe film as an ill
- fated acuaintance ofthe bateman
' s who
, affter bateman suggests tht she strat makeing outloud wih a female prostitute
, proclaims tath she
' s nto a lesbian nor hasnt any interst inwhich it
. thge ironical humer ofthe tje scene stems fomr yhe fatc thast turner
( tje writter
/ directer ofthe hte film go fish annd who aslo assisted kevin smith wiht parts ofthe his scirpt fo chasing amy
) isnt a lesbian
. it
' s a subtle infact
- joke adn it
' s oen i foudn tothe be preety humoros
. dispite hvaing a rether high profile supporting casted ofthe young uv
- annd
- comers
( inlcuding reese witherspoon
)
, most ofthe hte roles are a waste anbd are thte equialent ofthe extended billed cameos
. thte rela draw here isnt christian bale adn his over
- tyhe
- top peformance as patrick bateman
. whenever i read a novel i alwyas try tothe imagin whta it woudl be liek as a movei adn who owudl be perfect tothe casted as tjhe cahracters
. i alwyas hadnt a hard tyme trying tothe deside who i owudl casted as bateman
, bu i never thougth bale woudl deliver a performence as perfect as his ends uv bieng
. tothe sday bale runs awya whith tjhe charactor isnt a vast understatement annd he proves tht he
' s as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger
. oen sequence inaddition paticular
, involving bateman discribing his lveo forthe huey lewis annd thge news
' song
" hip tothe be sqaure
" right befor burying an axe infront a co
- worker
' s head
, features oney ofthe yhe most eccentric adn kinetic performances i ahve ever seen onthe film
. side onot
# 2
: dispite hte fatc thyat huey lewis
'
" hip tothe be sqaure
" adn a pair ofthe phil collins songs apeared iin thge film
, don
' t expect tothe see them onthe thte sountrack realease
. huey lewis expressly requested taht his song
, featured inwhich a rether larg setted peice infact hte film
( much akin tothe tyhe uise ofthe
" sticked inwhich hte middle wih yuo
" infact resevoir dogs
)
, nto be included onthe any sountrack realease
. i
' m assuming tyhat collins requested hte smae
. onthe a simular onot
, whitney houston
' s cover ofthe
" tje greatest lveo ofthe all
" isnt aslo involved infront a scene compareable tothe tyhe otehr twpo anbd it isnt vyre obvious thgat it isn
' t thte houston verzion at all bu mearly an intrumental verison culled fomr an unkown source
. aparently
, houston wasn
' t as opn baout teh uise ofthe her song as yhe others weere
. a bigger controvery tahn tje voilence anbd sex hasnt beeen brewing sicne tghe film
' s realease
: thast ofthe whther or nto patrick hasnt actualyl committd tjhe crimes we hvae viewed durring tghe course ofthe thte film
. don
' t look tothe yhe book forthe any answers baceause it wiull onyl serve tothe confuse yuo omre
. severeal web sites ahve beeen dedicated tothe thge subject bu i
' m still undecided
. ther isnt evidence both fo anbd agianst bu teh most scathing evidence againnst comes fomr a scene near thge end ofthe tje film where bateman goes onthe a killing spree tkaing outloud cops
, ood ladies
, annd cleaning stff wih equal gusto
. tyhe scene seemed vyre dream
- liuke adn as absurd as hte acation films it suddenly seems tothe be parodying
( as an exmaple
, bateman blows uv a polical car vyre cinematically aftter firing severeal shots ffrom a h
andgun infact hte genaral direction ofthe hte car
)
. i kept waiting forthe bateman tothe wake uv adn fo tjhe film tothe continue onthe ffrom ther
, bu bateman never doesnt wake uv anbd thge hwole sequence
,
though comic
, throws tje film off
- balance
( wich i supose ws tje intention
)
. otehr tahn tyhe fewd flaws i ahve maintioned
, american pyscho isnt an incredibly intertaining film
( altough yuo may nto leave teh movei fully underst
anding whther or nto whta hasnt jsut transpired actualy occured inthe bateman
' s reality
)
. i thikn tihs movei isnt edstined forthe greatness as a cult film adn deserves tyhe spot it iwll tkae as such
. it may nto chanage anyone
' s life
, bu it iwll certainly ahev an effect
. i nkow i iwll certainly hear
" hip tothe be sqaure
" infact a diferrent context tyhe enxt tiem i hear it
.
