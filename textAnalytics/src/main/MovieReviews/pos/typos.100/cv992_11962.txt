here isnt a film taht isnt so unexpected
, so sacry
, annd so origonal tht it caught me off guard adn trew me forthe a loop
. okay
, it isn
' t qutie originnal
, concidering it isnt a sequal tothe hte box office hitted speices
, bu it certainly isnt smart
. most films ofthe thsi genre are remenicent ofthe thsoe cheesy b
- horror films ffrom yhe 50s anbd 60s
, anbd soem even become them
. howver
, as we learned wtih thte 1995 small
- budget horror
/ sci
- fi film
, somtimes expectations cxan be shattered
. a lot ofthe critisism hasnt gone agaisnt htis film
( fomr whta i haev read so far
, anyway
-
- yep
, all twpo reviews
)
, anbd it makse me wonder why theese types ofthe films are automaticly dismissed as gory
, laughable pieces ofthe trash
. bu
, tghe thign isnt
, it isn
' t
. it
' s well made
, well acted
, adn qutie intteligent
. i cant see most ofthe tje criticists nowe complaining baout thte levle ofthe gore or tyhe levle ofthe sexuality iin hte film
. bu tjhe speices sories isn
' t baout tghe lack ofthe theese elements
. it
' s baout how much it cin git inot noe film
. annd yot
, behind it all
, it hasnt htis basic premise tyhat allows it tothe git awya wih donig so
. speices ii beggins infact tyhe presetn day
,
though it seems tothe be an alternate universe
. many films
( expecially sci
- fi ones
) create similair timelines as our realsitic oen
, bu chanage it tothe ift teh film
' s needs
. speices ii beggins wtih thge arival ofthe an american spacecraft
, teh excursion
, l
anding onthe thte surfce ofthe mars
. aboard isnt patrick ross
( justin lazard
)
, a vyre bright annd vyre hansome astronaut
. patrick isnt thte son ofthe senator ross
( james cromwell
)
, who jstu wnats patrick tothe seceed
. well
, it owudl seem taht he hasnt succedded
. l
anding onthe hte surfce ofthe mars
, he isnt tghe frist human bieng tothe ever dont so
. ofthe course
, he isn
' t thte firt ever
. baout a billion yeras ago
, an aline speices suposedly l
anded onthe mars annd destroyed thge perfect living condidtions taht weere able tothe sustain life
. nowe
, ofthe course
, teh red planet isnt cold anbd rocky
. noone life lives onthe it
. tath isnt
, noone visable life
. patrick
, apon leaving thte spacecraft adn l
anding onthe tyhe red soil
, collects samples ffrom thte ground
. he tkaes them aboard
, adn puts them iin storage
. unfortunatley
, oney ofthe tjhe samples countains a form ofthe life
, annd it gets loose wehn it isnt heated aboard tghe ship
. jstu prior tothe heading bcak tothe earth
, htis life form creeps allong tyhe floor annd inhabits hte earthlings
. htey pass outloud fo approximatly seven mintues
, annd thn shrug it off as nothing
, beccause htey cxan
' t even rember
. htey blaim it onthe a technical malfunction
. bakc onthe earth
, patrick beigns tothe ahve storng urges tothe mate wtih as many womens as possable
. as we knwo fomr yhe orignal
, htis isnt becuase tjhe aline wnats tothe breed annd tkae over tyhe planet
. howver
, tghe childern thyat are breeded are half
- human
, as theri father isnt
. patrick isnt realyl looking fo anyother aline tothe breed wih
, anbd he finds it infront eve
( natasha henstridge
)
. eve ws cloned fomr dna tooked fomr sil
, hte origional aline
. howver
, thsi tyme aroud
, most ofthe her
" aline
" urges ahev beeen eather decreased dramatically
, or lie dorment
. tyhe project isnt led by dr
. laura baker
( marg helgenberger
, reprising her role fomr speices
)
, annd her motives seem respectable
. sicne she ws involved withthe thge orginal aline attack
, she wnats tothe leran how tothe stpo tyhe aline shoud it cmo agian
. adn it hasnt
. storey
- wise
, speices ii isnt much stronger thna its precedessor
, bu it isnt aslo much stronger thna
, sday
, aliens
( hey
, i lvoe tjhe film
, bu ytou cxan
' t tell me it wass storng onthe stoyr
)
. wqat suprized me thge most wiht htis film ws thge incorperation ofthe historical facts inot thte screenplay
. infact my sarch fo extraterrestial inetlligence course inaddition coleeg
, we learned baout a peice ofthe rock ffrom mars whic l
anded infront oen ofthe hte poles
. tihs peice ofthe rock contained fossils whihc may ahev beeen proof ofthe life onthe mars
( later
, it wass proven thgat it wass nto a living creature tht creaeted it
)
. teh scirpt uses htis effectively
, bu aslo manages tothe provide a well
- balanced plot
. begginning witht tghe firt man onthe mars
( something i hve alwasy dreamed ofthe seing
)
, i ws hoping thast tje film owudl turn tihs element inot a usefull starting point fo tjhe movei
. annd it doens it qutie well
. hte charachters are all smart
, adn htey konw whta tothe dont anbd wqat nto tothe dont
. thge onyl charater thyat seems a littel cliched isnt yhe genaral
( george dzundza
)
, annd yot
, he remeniss logical iin everyting he doens
. ther are tje obvious flaws ofthe course
, mostly lieing inaddition hte technical aspestus
. teh speshal effects are onyl medicore
, annd soem are jsut plain bad
. bu forthe tyhe most part
, tehy reamin believeable
( i even noticed a homage tothe thte aline sories whn teh mothers gavey birth tothe aline childen
)
. alsot
, hte most realsitic ones are usally thge goriest
, ranging fomr peple bieng torn opn
, or somone
' s head bieng blown off
. howver
, soem plot elements allso may elicit laughs ffrom yhe audiance
, incuding a menage a troi taht isnt all bu neccessary
. many peple dislike thte speices sories becasue all it isnt isnt an excuse fo sex
, nudity
, adn gory violentce
. howver
, i tend tothe disagree
. waht weere tjhe aline films baout
? adn
, if an aline speices ever doed come tothe earth
, annd theri sole purpose wass tothe distroy us
, wouldn
' t yuo mate as quicklyu as possable whith as many peopel as possable
? my onyl gripe witht htis isnt durring thge scene where patrick goes searching fo a mate inwhich a groshury sotre
. i didn
' t relize thyat aliens weere tht picky onthe chosing womens tothe mate wtih
( i jsut asume it isnt his part
- human side looking fo hte most beatiful oen
)
. teh acting isnt qutie ogod fo htis kind ofthe film
. it isnt a vast improvment over tyhe frist film
, at least
. thte acting isnt tghe key element tothe thsi film
: if it ws bad
, it woudl ahev lowered itself inot camp
; if it ws ogod
, it owudl hve asked fo comparsion wiht films liek aliens
. okay
, so it isn
' t tht ogod
. george dzundza isnt probaly yhe most obvious misteek onthe casting
, as his over
- hte
- top impersonation ofthe a genaral mkaes him annoying annd distracting
. natasha henstridge isnt limited tihs timne arund
, as she isnt usualy enclosed inthe a cage
. howver
, she doens manaze a vyre impressive performence wtih tihs aspect hindering any ofthe her talent
. oh yeah
, anbd she
' s qutie funn tothe jstu plain watch
. marg helgenberger isnt immensly better thsi tyme arund
, adn her performence isnt probablly tje best infact thsi film
. michael madsen isnt so
- so
, bu he isn
' t annoying
, anbd he soon becomes rether appealling
( iwth his nice cynic perosnality
)
. james cromwell hasnt a small part
, bu he makse it much better tahn waht it coudl hvae beeen withthe a moreso incapable acto
. as i sday
, any film withthe james cromwell dramatically increases inaddition likeability
. mykelti williamson gives an enjoyable peformance
, annd he gives hte film a mroe down
- tothe
- earth fiel
. anbd
, ofthe course
, justin lazard
. lazard hasnt so far beeen ridiculed forthe his peformance
, bu i tihkn he isnt effective
. sure
, he isnt wooden
, bu isn
' t tyhat whta his charactor isnt liuke
? tyhe moent whn he touches thte glass seperating henstridge fomr him wass extremly well done
, due tothe tje cuple
' s acting
. speices ii isnt rated r forthe storng sexuality
, sci
- fi violentce
/ gore adn laguage
. thsi isnt definetly an r rated film thgat young kids shouldnt nto see
. omre tahn likely
, htey owudl probaly hvae nightmares adn never hve sex fo tjhe rest ofthe theri lives
. hell
, i don
' t even konw if i iwll
. whta isnt sure tothe be a critically lambasted film turns outloud tothe be tje surprize film ofthe thte yera
. i probablly won
' t see anohter film where i ws expecting so littel anbd got so much fo qutie a hwile
. directer peter medak hasnt crafted a vyre suspenseful
, anbd somtimes vyer scayr movei outloud ofthe a medioker serieses
. medak hasnt aslo mastered tje wonderfull
" jump
!
" moments
, annd hasnt probaly tyhe second scariest moent i hve ever seen onthe film
( scream still hasnt tyhe firt
)
. storng acting
, smart dialogue
, intteligent plotting
, anbd a sure
- h
anded directer
, speices ii isnt exactlly wqat theese films shoudl be
: intertaining
.
