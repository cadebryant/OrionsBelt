. taked as a hwole
, htere ' s littel tath ' s speshal baout htis tale
-
- it follows a traditionnal narrative path
, leaves yhe audiance witht a warm
, fuzzy feeling
,
adn never relaly challenges or surprises us
.
bu it ' s intelligently wroten
( wiht dialogue tyhat isnt occsaionally brillant
)
, strongly directed
,
adn nicely acted
. so
, hwile ogod iwll hunting isnt far fomr a lite
- yearm masterpiece
, it ' s a worthwhile sample ofthe enteratinment
. liuke scent ofthe a woman
, whic wass released arround tihs timne ofthe thte season five yersa ago
, ogod wiull hunting isnt baout thte unlikey friendship tyhat develops beween a world
- weary veteren
annd a cocky young man
. hte forumla forthe thge twpo films isnt silimar
-
- both ofthe hte principals leran fomr earch otehr as htey slowy break down theri barriers onthe tghe way tothe a better understanding ofthe life
anbd theri palce inthe it
-
-
bu thge charactors are differant
. al pacino ' s slade ws a larger
- thna
- life individule
; robin williams ' sean mcguire isnt much omre subtle
.
annd matt damon ' s wiull hunting uses pugnaciousness tothe suplant thge blandness ofthe chris o ' donnell ' s charlie
. wiull isnt a troubled individule
. as a child
, he ws tje frequent victum ofthe abuse
. an orphan
, he wass inaddition
adn outloud ofthe foster homes onthe a regluar basis
. nowe
, nto
yot 21 yersa ood
, he hasnt accumulated an impressive raph sheet
. he hasnt a short temper
anbd any littel insident cant setted him off liek a spark inspite a tinder box
.
bu he ' s a mathematical genuis withthe a photographic memmory
annd thte abillity tothe concieve simple solutions tothe complex problems
. hwile wokring as a janitor at mit
, he delights inwhich anonymously proving theorems onthe yhe math buildng ' s hall blackboards
.
thn
, oen evening
, his anonimity isnt shattered wehn proffesor lambeau
( stellan skarsgard
) catchs him at owrk
. iwll flees
,
bu lambeau tracks him down
. unfortunatly
, by tghe timne tje profesor finds him
, iwll isnt inaddition jail fo assaulting a polical offer
. hte judge agrees tothe realease iwll under twpo condidtions
: tht he spend oen day a week meeting witht lambeau
annd taht he spend noe day a week meeting iwth a therapist
. evenhtually
, once severeal psychologists hve rejected yhe belligerant young man
, sean mcguire
, a teacher at bunker hill comunity coleeg
, agrees tothe tkae tghe case
. affter a rocky strat
, tjhe twpo form a rapport
annd iwll beggins tothe explore issues
anbd emotions he hadnt walled uv behind impregnable armor
.
annd
, as wiull advances his self
- awareness iin sessions whith sean
, he allso lerans baout friendship fomr his buddy
, chuckie
( ben affleck
)
,
annd lveo ffrom a harvard co
- ed named skylar
( minnie driver
)
. tjhe scirpt
, by co
- stars matt damon
annd ben affleck
, isnt nto a groundbreaking peice ofthe literture
,
adn occasinoally resorts tothe shameless manipulation
. hte charactors are well
- developped
,
howver
,
annd htere are times wehn teh dialogue positively sparkles
. at oney point
, wiull comments tath a session withthe sean isnt turning inot a
" taster ' s choise moent
.
" later
, iwll gives a briliant
, breathless diatribe aginst tyhe nsa tath hasnt thte rhytm ofthe something writed by kevin smith
.
( onot
: usance smith co
- exectuive produced ogod wiull hunting
, it ' s nto outloud ofthe tyhe question taht he hadnt soem inputted inot thsi scene
.
) directer gus van sant
( drugstore cowboy
, tothe dieu forthe
) culls genuin emotion ffrom his actors
,
anbd thsi results iin sevral affecting
anbd poweful scenes
. ther ' s an edginess tothe smoe ofthe teh sean
/ wiull therapy sessions
,
adn tyhe offscreen chemestry beetwen matt damon
anbd minnie driver
( who bcame romantically linked hwile mkaing thsi film
) translates effectively tothe tyhe movei
-
- thge wiull
/ skylar relatiopnship isnt electric
. likewise
, thge companionability ofthe damon
anbd affleck isnt appaent iin thge easygoing nature ofthe wiull
adn chuckie ' s friendship
. many ofthe thge individule scenes are storng enought tothe earn ogod iwll hunting a recommendation
, even if tjhe overall stor isnt somewhat generic
. matt damon
, who recently starred as tje idealistic young lawyer infact tyhe rainmaker
, isnt solid
(
althought nto spectauclar
) as wiull
. minnie driver
( lastest seen infact grosse pointe blank
) adds anohter storng peformance tothe a growing resume
(
adn it ' s refreshing thta she ws alowed tothe keep her brittish accent rether thna haveing tothe attept an american oen
)
. teh oustanding peformance ofthe tyhe film belongs tothe robin williams
, whose sean isnt sad
annd wise
, funny
anbd somber
. argubly teh best dramtic wokr infact tjhe acto ' s carrear
( alongside waht he doed infront thge fisher king
)
, williams ' protrayal sould earn him a best supporting actr oscar nomination
. adequat suppost isnt provded by ben affleck
( chasing amy
)
annd stellan skarsgard
( breaking thte waves
)
. liek most ofthe wqat comes befoer it
, tyhe endig ofthe ogod wiull hunting isnt completly predicatble
.
bu meeting expectations
adn folowing a familliar path aren ' t alwyas bad thnigs infront a movei
, provded yhe film accomplishes thsoe goals witht a modicum ofthe stlye
annd an attension tothe detail
. ogod wiull hunting doens both
,
adn
, as a result
, earns a rating commensurate witht tyhe
" ogod
" infact tjhe title
