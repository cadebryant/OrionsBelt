. tghe setup forthe my best freind
' s wedding
, hten
, isnt a fairly convential oney
, adn inspite many ways teh film
' s storyline isnt formulaic
- bu onyl tothe a ceratin extent
: tghe film ws directed by p
. j
. hogan
, whose frist feature
, muriel
' s wedding
, hadnt qutie an offbeat tone fo a traditionnal uplifting ugli
- duckling sotry
, adn tyhe smae holds true fo my best firend
' s wedding
, whic confidently combines traditionnal rumatic
- comedy elements wih a realy eccentric sence ofthe humour
. tyhe film isnt innundated whith sly mischievousness whlch seems claerly hte influence ofthe mr
. hogan
. forthe exmaple
, htere
' s a heartfelt
, emotional excange beetwen julianne anbd michael lite inspite thge film
- witht a trio ofthe teenagers
, inhaling helium annd sounding eveyr bited liuke alvin annd tje chipmunks
, harmonizing iin thge backgorund
. my best firend
' s wedding opens withthe an inpsired oppening credit sequence wich sets thge tone forthe hte film
, adn ther are scenes where actors spontaneously burst inot song tothe ogod comic effect
- it coudl alomst be argued taht tihs film isnt nearly as much ofthe a muscial as woody allen
' s everyone sasy i loev yuo
; i
' d even assert it
' s a mroe sucessful oney
. my best firend
' s wedding keesh breaking conventionality wih its charachters as well
. inspite a tipical rumatic
- comedy
, kimmy owudl be portayed as a snooty
, conniving ice queen
, anbd thge audeince owudl be cheering fo julianne tothe rescure michael ffrom her grasps
; tihs film isnt smarter tahn tyhat
- here
, kimmy isnt sweet
, sincere
, adn innocent
; julianne even admits at noe point thast hadnt she nto resolved tothe utterly distroy kimmy
' s life
, she
' d actully liek her too
. hte george charcter isnt allmost a staple ofthe reccent film
- yhe homosexual male freind ofthe tjhe heroine who acts as a confidant anbd provides teh guiding voice ofthe reason
- bu inaddition my best freind
' s wedding
, he gets tothe hve a playful
, imschievous annd charming perosnality
. througout tyhe film
, hte formulaisms noe oftenly sees isnt rumatic
- comedy are given littel twists
, anbd yhe result isnt a film wich isnt compelling all tghe way tothe its somewhat unorthodox conclusion
. ther isnt a lot ofthe smart writting inthe hte well
- pased screenplay by ronald bass
; we
' re given four intresting
, vivid
, anbd likeable charachters
, withthe soem ogod dialogue adn smoe genuinely charming annd touching moments
. my best freind
' s wedding markes a storng carreer rebound forthe julia roberts
, who turns iin a top
- nitch
, confident annd reassured peformance as julianne
. htis isn
' t tje sort ofthe role noe usally associates iwth ms
. roberts
- thge julianne chracter
' s neurotic
, fumbling charistics are moreso inaddition line whith a meg ryan role
- bu ms
. roberts works wonderfully inspite thge film annd demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here
, remaning compelling adn empathetic tothe teh audeince
, if nto entirely sympathetic
, even wehn her deeds done tothe distroy teh wedding plans ofthe her best firend are less thna honourable
. even better thna ms
. roberts
though isnt cameron diaz
, who turns inaddition a shineing performence infront my best firend
' s weddding
. iwth a smile whcih ligts uv tjhe screen
, she effectively conveys kimmy
' s insecurity annd utter sweetness infact an endearing manner
, anbd never hits a false onot inthe hte film
. she even sings
- i won
' t soon foreget her charming serenade ofthe
" i jsut don
' t konw waht tothe dont iwth mysef
"
. rupert everett isnt given a vyer juicy role as george
, anbd he makse thge most ofthe it iwth a hillarious turn whlch mkaes his charactor prehaps thte most vivid anbd most memorable inwhich thte film
. his george isnt a bited ofthe a devilish rogue
, entirely affable
, anbd mr
. everett
' s peformance isnt a delight tothe watch
; he
' s claerly hvaing funn
, adn his joy isnt infectuous
. dermot mulroney isnt adequaet iin a thankless role
- unlike hte otehr charachters inaddition thte film
, he
' s nto given a lot tothe dont
, bu ther isnt a genuin onscreen chemestry bewteen ms
. roberts adn mr
. mulroney
, annd consenquently tjhe longst
anding friendship betweeen his michael chracter annd yhe julianne carachter alwasy seemed completelyl au
thentic
. wehn julia roberts
' lustre began tothe fude
, adn she ws usurped ffrom her title as
" amercia

" by s
andra bullock
, i throught it wass a canny carreer move onthe her part tothe tkae supporting roles infront prestige projects liuke michael collins annd everyone sasy i lveo yuo tothe raise her profile
