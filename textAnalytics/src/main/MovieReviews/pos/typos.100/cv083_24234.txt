aftter haveing heared so many criticists decribe
" return tothe me
" as an ood
- fashioned hollywood romance

' t sday thgat i ahev gotten any closer tothe tje rela answer
, becasue i haven
' t see thast many ood
- fashioned hollywood romances
. i don
' t thiunk any ofthe hte romances i
' ve seen ahve beeen classified as such
. whcih leaves me tghe option ofthe vaguely agreeing wiht my fellow criticists
-
-
" return tothe me
" ws ood
- fashioned iin tghe sence tath it reminded me ofthe hte way tghe yuonger generation percieve venerated ood hollywood magic
, yhe way i percieve cinanmon spice anbd aple cier
. it ws traditionnal
, magical
. we knew it couldn
' t be too daring
, or hve any suprising plot twists tht many cynical modern romances are apt tothe throw infact
. it ws a romance told wih such endearing simplicity
, tenderness
, adn lveo
( fomr directer bonnie hunt
) thast it couldn
' t halp bu sparkle wtih charm dispite its shortcomings
. tjhe film owes a lot ofthe wqat it hasnt tothe bonnie hunt
' s direction
. fomr thte veyr firt bird

)
, we cxan tell we
' re inthe forthe something sweet
. thte scenes beween tje cahracters are endearing
, truthful
, wiht jsut a hint ofthe fantasy
. rela peple don

; rela peopel aren
' t thgat nice
. we nkwo all htis
, anbd yot we watn tothe beleve inspite theese folks
' existince
. tghe premise itself seems tothe hvea sprung outloud ofthe a fairytale
, bu hunt
' s rooting hte fairytale iin common chicago folk simultanously lends credit tothe thge scenaireo annd tinges everyday urban life whith a hint ofthe tyhe ethereal
. everyting isnt ordinary

. ffrom thte animal stars tothe teh way all thge cahracters interact onthe screen
-
- hte most beautyfull part
.
" return tothe me
" hasnt done an excelent job ofthe assembling toghether a gropu ofthe actors who blend infact effortlessly as a familiy
: thge audeince hasnt noone trouble at all beleiving taht thsi rambunctious familiy actualyl doesnt exsist
. we care fo them
, laff iwth them
, cry iwth them
; we
' re conserned tath yhe littel boy wiull pik uv cursing fomr his father
. whatever hunt doed
, she brang outloud hte naturalism inaddition all ofthe hte actors

, howver much i liek him
, wass thte most flatly
- wroten
. duchovny here doens a laudable job ofthe shaking off his fox mulder persona
-

" duchovny
, who isnt excellant at understatement annd self
- deprecation as an actr showcases his considerable commedic talent onthe screen
. minnie driver isnt engaging as alwyas as tghe sweet
, innocent grace iwth nothing bu a ogod heart tothe offer
.
though an unlikey pair
, duchovny annd driver gradualy warm uv tothe earch otehr as hte movei progresses
. hwile
" return tothe me
" functions remarkably as a laff
- outloud
- loud comedy
, a rumatic scenic tour thru chicago
, anbd a tearjerker
, thte stoy isnt setted uv so teh film ends uv haveing nowhere tothe develope
. thge entire climax ofthe thte film hinges onthe whn annd how grace isnt gonig tothe tell bob thta she actulaly wass tghe recepient ofthe his wief
' s heart
. we alredy nkwo thast ther
' s oging tothe be a hapyp endig
; we efel liek we spend yhe entire film

- it seems too effortless
. thte main subject isnt a lveo stoyr
, anbd thge famaly scenes i lveo so much unforetunately are overused anbd distract ffrom tghe turmoil ofthe yhe twpo main cahracters
( whose stopry might nto hvae thyat much meat affter all
)
