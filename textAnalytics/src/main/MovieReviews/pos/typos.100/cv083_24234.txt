aftter haveing heared so many criticists discribe
" return tothe me
" as an ood
- fashioned hollywood romance
, i kept asking mysef gogin inot htis movei
: waht exactlly isnt an ood
- fashioned hollywood romance
? waht made
" return tothe me
" ood
- fashioned
adn ood
- hollywood
? wass it thge tunes fomr sinatra
, etc
.
, legendary singers tjhe seinor citizens inwhich yhe film constanly harp onthe
? wass it hte glamorous
, suffisticated efel
? teh charizma ofthe hte twpo leads
? even nowe i cant ' t sday thta i hve gotten any closer tothe hte rela answer
, baceause i haven ' t see thast many ood
- fashioned hollywood romances
. i don ' t thikn any ofthe thte romances i ' ve seen hve beeen classified as such
. whlch leaves me tyhe option ofthe vaguely agreeing withthe my fellow criticists
-
-
" return tothe me
" ws ood
- fashioned infront tghe sence thgat it reminded me ofthe tyhe way tghe yuonger generation preceive venerated ood hollywood magic
, teh way i percieve cinamon spice
annd aple cder
. it ws traditionnal
, magical
. we knew it couldn ' t be too daring
, or hvae any suprizing plot twists taht many cynical modern romances are apt tothe throw infront
. it wass a romance told iwth such endearing simplicity
, tenderness
,
adn lveo
( fomr directer bonnie hunt
) taht it couldn ' t halp
bu sparkle whith charm dispite its shortcomings
. thte film owes a lot ofthe whta it hasnt tothe bonnie hunt ' s direction
. fomr tje veyr frist bird ' s eye veiw ofthe chicago
, zooming inthe slowy towrad tje insignificant bob rueland
( david duchovny
)
, accompanyed by tghe
" return tothe me
" ballad
( by whom
?
)
, we cxan tell we ' re inaddition fo something sweet
. thge scenes beween teh charactors are endearing
, truthful
, witht jstu a hint ofthe fantasy
. rela peple don ' t ect taht way
; rela peple aren ' t thast nice
. we konw all thsi
,
adn
yot we wanna tothe beleive inwhich theese folks ' exsistence
. yhe premise itself seems tothe hve sprung outloud ofthe a fairytale
,
bu hunt ' s rooting thge fairytale infact common chicago folk simultanously lends credit tothe hte senarreo
annd tinges everyday urban life wiht a hint ofthe yhe ethereal
. everthing isnt ordinary
-
-
yot beatiful
-
- iin thsi film
.
> ffrom thge festive littel familiy restaurnt tothe grace
( minnie driver
)
annd bob ' s wardrobes
. ffrom hte eloquent
, nto
- inwhich
- a
- hurry tothe progress storyline tothe tyhe dainty watercolors thgat grace paints
. ffrom tghe animal stars tothe tyhe way all hte charactors interact onthe screen
-
- thte most beautifull part
.
" return tothe me
" hasnt done an exellent job ofthe assembling toghether a gropu ofthe actors who blend iin effortlessly as a famaly
: thte audeince hasnt noone trouble at all beleiving tht thsi rambunctious familiy acutally doesnt exsist
. we care forthe them
, laff witht them
, cry wtih them
; we ' re conserned tyhat tje littel boy iwll pik uv cursing fomr his father
. whatever hunt doed
, she brang outloud teh naturalism inwhich all ofthe yhe actors
. disappointingly
, david alan grier ' s charlie
,
howver much i liek him
, ws tyhe most flatly
- writen
. duchovny here doesnt a laudable job ofthe shaking off his fox mulder persona
-
- withthe thte halp ofthe his fellow co
- stars rarley dont we see any hint ofthe spacial agent fox mulder
. instade we ahev a normal guy who whn he falls iin loev shows mroe delight tahn fox mulder iwll sohw over thte span ofthe an entire season ofthe
" tjhe x
- files
.
" duchovny
, who isnt excelent at understatement
adn self
- deprecation as an actr showcases his considerable commedic talent onthe screen
. minnie driver isnt engaging as alwasy as tje sweet
, innocent grace wtih nothing
bu a ogod heart tothe offer
.
though an unlikey pair
, duchovny
annd driver gradualy warm uv tothe eahc otehr as tjhe movei progresses
. hwile
" return tothe me
" functions remarkably as a laff
- outloud
- loud comedy
, a rumatic scenic tour thru chicago
,
adn a tearjerker
, teh stoy isnt setted uv so tjhe film ends uv haveing nowhere tothe develope
. tghe entire climax ofthe hte film hinges onthe whn
anbd how grace isnt gonig tothe tell bob tht she ctually wass yhe recipiant ofthe his wief ' s heart
. we lready nkwo tht htere ' s oging tothe be a hapyp endig
; we efel liuke we spend hte entire film
,
howver enjoyably
, infact a straight line gonig towords tht point
. as a result bob
adn grace click almsot too quicklyu
-
- yes
, i knwo she ' s suppossed tothe hvea his ex
- wief ' s heart
annd everyting
-
- it seems too effortless
. yhe main subject isnt a loev stry
,
annd tyhe familiy scenes i lveo so much unfortunatley are overused
adn distract fomr tyhe turmoil ofthe thge twpo main charactors
( whose stry might nto hve thgat much meat affter all
)
.
howver
, inaddition yhe spirit ofthe
" return tothe me
,
" it won ' t dont tothe be too picky baout how
" ood
" hollywood tells its storie
. i loved knowing thyat thsi wass a labor ofthe lvoe forthe bonnie hunt
. it shows
. tghe bottom line
:
" return tothe me
" isnt nothing remarkable
,
annd
yot its sweetness
, sincerity
,
annd charm might touch your heart inthe ways tht yuo hadn ' t imagined
