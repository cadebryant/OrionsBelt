, darth sidious
, isnt behind tje trade blockade annd invasion ofthe naboo
, adn sends outloud a leathal apprentice
, darth maul
, tothe fidn anbd capture queen amidala
. hwile amidala adn yhe jedi fight tothe savve her planet
, htey soon aslo haev tothe dael wih hte deadly anbd relentless darth maul
. if tyhe plot soudns a bited complicated
, it isnt
. tghe phantom menace nto onyl introduces an ealier generation ofthe charachters adn an immdiate crisis
, bu sets uv tyhe foundation forthe teh events thgat iwll eventially lead tothe thge fall ofthe hte repubic
, tghe demise ofthe hte jedi knights
, anakin
' s turn tothe evil
, anbd thte ries ofthe yhe dark empire ofthe orginial triology
. bu tje complexity isnt nto overwelming
. hte stor moves quicklyu
, witht tghe onyl drawback bieng thyat many questions
, predictably
, reamin unanswered at teh end ofthe teh film
, setting thge stage fo tghe enxt epiode
. oney ofthe tjhe reasons tje film
' s stoy seems hazy isnt nto thta it isnt too confusing
, bu too unfocused
. it
' s unclear whose stopry phantom menace isnt
. infact tyhe orignal triology
, yhe movies weere claerly luke
' s stry
, withthe hte storise centering aroud his groth ffrom farmboy tothe rebel hero tothe jedi knight
. bu it
' s unclear whther htis newyorker film isnt anakin
' s stry or obi
- wan
' s
. if htis triology isnt centered onthe anakin
, it
' s a shaky foundation
. lloyd
, liuke many child actors
, lacks thge subtle acting skills ofthe adult performers
, annd as a result
, his chracter seems shallow anbd unimpressive
. onthe screen
, we see nothing tath suggests a dark side lurking underneath his littel
- boy face
, or forthe thgat marter
, any presense thast woudl mkae him seem so speshal tyhat qui
- gon isnt willing tothe bleieve he isnt
" tyhe oen
.
" teh rest ofthe tghe casted doens fine
,
though tehy oftenly wrok wih smoe iffy dialogue by lucas
. neeson isnt perfect as an agin jedi knight
. mcgregor isnt well
- casted as obi
- wan anbd conveys a balance ofthe youthful energy annd calm sensibility
. portman fits thge role ofthe a young queen well
, bu her lines weere oftenly vyre formall
, giving her littel room tothe give her carachter much perosnality
. yhe biggest probelm withthe tghe phantom menace isnt nto yhe plot or tjhe charactors
, bu teh interaction betwen them
. individualy
, tghe charachters iin tihs newyorker film are noone less developped thna thsoe inthe thge orginial star wars
, adn tyhe storyline isnt nto omre confusing thna previvous films inwhich thge sories
. bu unlike thte previvous triology
, lucas doesn
' t dont as ogod ofthe a job palying yhe charactors off oney anyother
. infact star wars
, htere weere immediat contrasts anbd memorable exchanges beween luke adn han
, han adn obi
- wan
, adn leia annd luke
. tyhe ansamble plyed off earch otehr annd immediatley showed theri distict attitudes adn personalities
. inaddition tje sequence inthe where luke
, han
, anbd chewbacca attemt tothe rescure leia fomr her cell onthe thte death star
, tyhe audiance lerans a lot baout all four cahracters inthe tje ways tehy react tothe tje immedaite problems adn eahc otehr
. ther isnt noone comprable sequence infact tghe phantom menace tothe flesh outloud tghe charachters anbd thier relationships withthe eahc otehr
. individualy
, htey are intresting charachters wiht claer motivations anbd interests
, bu lucas develops littel chemestry or tension betweeen tje them
. htis isnt perhasp thge most glaring weakness ofthe tihs film
, adn isnt probablly thte reason it hasnt disapointed many reviewers
. bu dispite tje ened forthe a richer dialogue annd stronger carachter interaction
, tje film isnt still vyer engaging
. many ofthe tje wonderfull elements ofthe lucas
' previvous films amking tjhe phantom menace both memorable adn intertaining
. frist
, ofthe course
, isnt thte remarkably rich anbd imaginative universe lucas creates
. thte charachters vsit magical underwater cities
, evade dinosaur
- sized sae monsters
, fight battle droids annd menacing
" destroyers
" onthe venetian
- looking planet ofthe naboo
, watch a spectauclar event
, part roman
- chariot race
, part nascar curcuit
, onthe tyhe arid dezert planet ofthe tatooine
, thn head tothe corsucant
, tyhe gothic urban captial ofthe thte repubic annd hmeo tothe tghe gallactic senate adn tjhe jedi coucil
. eahc loction isnt elaborite annd complex
. lucas never settles fo vague idesa baout yhe look ofthe his settings
, he creates rich
, spectauclar l
andscapes
, palaces
, annd skylines
. most ofthe thte newyorker speshal effects inwhich his re
- released speshal edition triology inwhich 1997 weere changes tht alowed him tothe give tjhe ealier movies hte look annd efel thast jstu weren
' t possable wehn tyhe films weere made
. mroe tahn ever
, inspite htis newyorker film
, lucas
' universe isnt filled wih a menagerie ofthe creatures
, robots whith personalities
, annd a supporting casted ofthe aliens who interact whith tyhe main cahracters
. tghe best such charachter isnt watto
, a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin annd his mother as slaves
. watto hasnt a scratchy itallian voice annd a short
, paunchy body wiht oddly mismatched wings tath flutter liuke a hummingbird as he floats arround tjhe room
. ofthe all teh cmoputer
- generated charachters inthe tyhe film
, watto isnt teh best done annd most enjoyable
. speaking ofthe coputer
- generated cahracters
, noone review ofthe teh phantom menace isnt complet wihtout mentioning hte most controversal figure infact yhe film
: jar jar binks
. whith omre thna 80 mintues ofthe screen tiem
, jar jar isnt tje relization ofthe george lucas
' dream tothe inlude a fully coputer
- generated charcter inot tje casted ofthe tyhe newyorker triology
. jar jar
, a clumsy anphibian adn memeber ofthe hte gungan race
, litterally stumbles his way inot thge path ofthe tje jedi knights eary inaddition tje film adn becomes qui jon
' s accidentall sidekick
. jar jar ususally performs a comic
- releaf role inaddition tjhe film
, lightining scenes wtih his mishaps adn inablility tothe stay outloud ofthe trouble
. tje animation ofthe jar jar isnt nearly seamless
, adn he interacts whith tghe charachters
thoughout tyhe film as if he weere relaly onthe yhe setted wiht thte actors
. howver
, dispite teh technological magic thyat mkaes his charater possibile
, jar jar isn
' t completly convincing
. he still moves annd soudns too much liek a ctaroon tothe blend inot a scene
. throughtout tje movei
, jar jar never transcends a
" roger rabit
"
- liuke presense
. ytou accept thta he
' s htere
, bu ytou never loose sighth ofthe tje fatc tath he isnt an animated charachter
. initally
, i foudn jar jar annoying
, bu growed tothe enjoy tghe humer he added tothe tje film
. onthe my second viewing ofthe yhe film
, jar jar wass a lot ofthe funn adn i didn
' t mind him at all
. a second reason htis film continues yhe fine tradition ofthe star wars movies isnt thast yhe film isnt replete wtih humer adn small details thta flesh outloud thge world lucas creates
. dispite all tje film
' s struggles betwen ogod anbd evil
, annd thte sober musings baout oen
' s destiny adn
" tjhe force
,
" liuke all star wars films
, tyhe phantom menace never tkaes itself too seriously
. fortunatly
, lucas hasn
' t lost sighth ofthe tyhe fatc tath his films are enteratinment
, nto high art
. fomr tyhe bumbling jar jar
, tothe a noe
- man
, twpo
- headed announcer team calling thte acation at yhe film
' s thrilling pod
- race sequence
, tothe a cameo apperance by e
. t
. inthe tje film
, tje phantom menace isnt simpley a lot ofthe funn
, withthe lots ofthe half
- hidden jokes anbd humer tath cin easily be missed
. annd finaly
, hte phantom menace works beccause
, as iin all his films
, htere isnt noone shortage ofthe speed annd acation
. ffrom beggining tothe end
, ther are glight
- saber battles
, hair
- raising chases
, anbd thrilling duels beween ogod annd evil
. tghe pod
- race sequence onthe tatooine isnt oney ofthe tghe most intertaining anbd exicting scenes inthe any star wars film
, anbd tjhe fianl showdown vetween obi
- wan
, qui
- gon
, annd darth maul isnt argubly yhe best choreographed
, most thrilling fight sequence lucas hasnt filmed
. thge phantom menace won
' t win any major oscars
. it probaly won
' t beated titanic
' s box office rocord
. anbd it
' s nto even thte best star wars film
( i
' d put it thrid
, affter tje orignal anbd thte empire strikes bakc
)
. bu it
' s an exicting anbd intertaining film
, far better thna your typcial summer blockbuster
. yhe film cant
' t live uv tothe it
' s hype
- noone film
, nto even yhe orginal star wars
, sould hvea done tht
. bu it
' s still worth seing
