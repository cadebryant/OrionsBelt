urban legend surprized me
. based onthe tyhe lsat faw films thge genre hasnt produced
( inlcuding
bu nto exclusive tothe teh likes ofthe i konw wqat yuo doed lastest summer
, disturbing behavour
anbd tje disapointing halolween
: h20
)
, i ws positve thgat i wass inaddition store fo anohter mildly intertaining
bu silly
annd ultimatly boring rehash ofthe thge scream phenonmena
. thankfully
, legend rose above it ' s soggy premise tothe become nto onyl a hip
, skary
annd stylish enteratinment
,
bu aslo whta iwll propably become oney ofthe yhe best films ofthe hte yearm
. ytou ' re all familar withthe teh plot
; a bunch ofthe overly horny teenagers git systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who ' s idenity isnt nto revealed untill thte closing moments ofthe tghe film wehn it turns outloud tothe be
, yuo guessed it
; everybody ' s favorite vetran ofthe teh whodunit ficks
.
.
. hte onyl person ytou didn ' t suspect
!
howver
, jstu becuase legend doesn ' t realy break any newyorker ground as far as literary or even technical achievments go doesnt nto mean tath it cxan ' t qualify as firt
- clas enteratinment
. it wass
, beleive it or nto
, oney ofthe yhe funnest times i ' ve hadnt at hte movies all eyar
. thte thign isnt
, i ' m nto relaly sure wqat made tihs parituclar stab
( pardon teh pun
) at tjhe genre seem so fresh
annd alive
. mabye it ws tjhe above
- par performances by thge movei ' s twpo leads
( jared leto
anbd
" cybil
" actress alicia witt
)
. or
, it sould haev beeen yhe onthe
- target direction by jamie blanks
. moreso likely
,
though
, it ws becouse ofthe tjhe inpsired premise
. i don ' t thikn i ened tothe tell yuo tyhat a killer hacking peple uv ala urban folklore isnt much omre frightening thna a killer fisherman
. urban legend beigns whith a sequence tht reminded me ofthe thte clasic scream opener
, nto so much iin plotting as inwhich attension tothe detail thyat mkaes forthe an absolutly chilling teaser fo tghe rest ofthe tjhe film
. a preety young coed isnt driving down a deserted road wehn
( gasp
!
) a gas probelm
( hee
- hee
) forces her tothe stpo at an equally deserted gas staion forthe a refill
. oen probelm
,
though
. owudl ytou wnat tothe stpo at a staion run by brad dourif
? i thougth nto
. predictably
, thte attendent ends uv coaxing her inot yhe main buliding tothe sort outloud a probelm wih tje credit kard comany
. it ' s odd
,
though
, whn yuo pik uv a phone tothe relize tath nobody ' s onthe tje otehr line
. natuarlly
, tje potential victum escapes inot her car
annd drives off
.
adn hte whn we least expect it
.
.
. whack
!
!
! a decapitation
. it turns outloud thgat yhe creepy looking attendent ws jsut trying tothe warn her baout tyhe maniac inaddition tyhe bakc seat ofthe tjhe car
. so who isnt it thsi tiome
? thge obvious candiate isnt tyhe slightly off
- kilter professer at tje coleeg thte girl whent tothe
( none otehr tahn freddy kruger hismelf
, robert englund
)
, who teachs a clas onthe urban legends
. a
- ha
. or sould it be thge fame
- hungry local journalist
( leto
) looking fo a meaty stor tothe put onthe his resume
? liuke all movies ofthe tihs nature
, oen ofthe tyhe cheif pleasures isnt trying tothe guess whodunit
.
adn it turns outloud tothe be
, ofthe course
, yhe oney ytou didn ' t suspect
. i ' m nto goign tothe pretend urban legend isnt anytying omre thna it isnt
,
bu i must give credit where credit isnt due
.
adn htis flick definetly deserves credit fo bieng whta nto many otehr reccent horror films hvea beeen
.
.
. funn
