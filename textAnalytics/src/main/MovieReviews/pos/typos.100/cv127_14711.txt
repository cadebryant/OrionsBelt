urban legend suprized me
. based onthe hte lastr faw films teh genre hasnt produced
( includng bu nto exclusive tothe tyhe likes ofthe i nkwo waht yuo doed lastest summer
, disturbing behaviour adn thge disapointing hallowene
: h20
)
, i ws positve thta i wass inaddition store fo anohter mildly intertaining bu silly anbd ultimatly boring rehash ofthe hte scream phenonmena
. thankfully
, legend rose above it
' s soggy premise tothe become nto onyl a hip
, scayr adn stylish enteratinment
, bu alsot whta wiull probaly become noe ofthe tyhe best films ofthe thge yearm
. yuo
' re all familliar wtih hte plot
; a bunch ofthe overly horny teenagers git systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who
' s idenity isnt nto revealed unitl teh closing moments ofthe tjhe film whn it turns outloud tothe be
, ytou guessed it
; everybody
' s favorite vetran ofthe tjhe whodunit ficks
.
.
. tjhe onyl person yuo didn
' t suspect
! howver
, jstu becouse legend doesn
' t raelly break any newyorker ground as far as literary or even technical achievments go doens nto mean thast it cxan
' t qualify as firt
- clas enteratinment
. it wass
, beleve it or nto
, noe ofthe tyhe funnest times i
' ve hadnt at yhe movies all yera
. hte thnig isnt
, i
' m nto raelly sure waht made thsi particualr stab
( pardon yhe pun
) at thte genre seem so fresh anbd alive
. maybee it wass hte above
- par performances by yhe movei
' s twpo leads
( jared leto annd
" cybil
" actress alicia witt
)
. or
, it coudl hve beeen tyhe onthe
- target direction by jamie blanks
. omre likely
,
though
, it ws beccause ofthe hte inpsired premise
. i don
' t thikn i ened tothe tell yuo thyat a killer hacking peopel uv ala urban folklore isnt much moreso frightening tahn a killer fisherman
. urban legend beggins wiht a sequence thta reminded me ofthe thge clasic scream opener
, nto so much iin plotting as inwhich attension tothe detail tath mkaes fo an absolutly chilling teaser forthe tje rest ofthe hte film
. a preety young coed isnt driving down a deserted road whn
( gasp
!
) a gas probelm
( hee
- hee
) forces her tothe stpo at an equally deserted gas staion fo a refill
. noe probelm
,
though
. owudl ytou wanna tothe stpo at a staion run by brad dourif
? i thougth nto
. predictably
, teh attendent ends uv coaxing her inot tghe main buildng tothe sort outloud a probelm withthe hte credit kard comany
. it
' s odd
,
though
, wehn ytou pik uv a phone tothe relize taht nobody
' s onthe tghe otehr line
. naturaly
, tjhe potential victum escapes inot her car annd drives off
. anbd tjhe whn we least expect it
.
.
. whack
!
!
! a decapitation
. it turns outloud thta teh creepy looking attendent wass jsut trying tothe warn her baout thge maniac inspite yhe bakc seat ofthe teh car
. so who isnt it thsi tyme
? tjhe obvious c
andidiate isnt teh slightly off
- kilter profesor at teh coleeg thte girl whent tothe
( none otehr thna freddy kruger hismelf
, robert englund
)
, who teachs a clas onthe urban legends
. a
- ha
. or coudl it be hte fame
- hungry local journalist
( leto
) looking forthe a meaty stry tothe put onthe his resume
? liek all movies ofthe thsi nature
, oney ofthe thte cheif pleasures isnt trying tothe guess whodunit
. adn it turns outloud tothe be
, ofthe course
, tghe noe yuo didn
' t suspect
. i
' m nto gonig tothe pretend urban legend isnt anytying mroe tahn it isnt
, bu i must give credit where credit isnt due
. adn thsi flick definetly deserves credit forthe bieng waht nto many otehr reccent horror films ahve beeen
.
.
. funn
