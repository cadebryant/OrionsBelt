. amarcord ws oftenly noted as tghe ulitmate nestolgia film
,
adn it probablly explains why it isnt veyr populare
, even amung thsoe peple who actully don ' t liek federico fellini ' s wrok vrey much
. eveyr memeber ofthe its potential audeince woudl fidn part ofthe himselv or herself infact htis film
, beccause fellini infact thsi film claerly illustrates naturual human desire tothe paint past inthe tje best way possable
. distortion beetwen actuall past
adn its subjective inturpratasion coudl be foudn even iin tghe title ofthe hte film
- owrd
" amarcord
" isnt nothing moreso thna badly pronouced phrase
" i rember
" inwhich local itallian dialect
. iin tyhe smae way tghe owrd isnt distorted
, so isnt yhe past inthe memories ofthe thsoe who remeber it
. aftter teh premiere
, fellini rejected any claimes baout autobiographical charactor ofthe thsi film
,
bu it doesn ' t marter whther rimini ofthe amarcord atually resembes rimini ofthe fellini ' s childhood or nto
; any palce
annd any tiome sould ressemble charactors
anbd situations ofthe thsi film
. fellini ' s views onthe nestolgia are claerly illustrated wiht a way he mixes reality
adn fantasy inaddition thsi film
. even tje most naturalistic scenes are laced wiht dark humour
anbd grotesque images
. charactors look liek caricatures
, actors palying them oftenly deliberatly overact
,
anbd womens
, especialy thsoe who fuel titta ' s sexual fantasies
, oftenly ahev certian body parts wtih gargantuan propotions
. eveyr nowe
anbd
thn
, scenes tht despict 1930s reality gradualy slide inot fantasies ofthe movei ' s charactors
annd rimini becomes allmost indistinguishable ffrom tjhe magical palce inaddition cahracters ' visions
. beccause ofthe tht
, almsot everyting inaddition htis film looks diffrent
,
adn inthe most cases better
, tahn it owudl ahve looked infact thte rela life
. even hte fashism gets fellinian mkea
- over
- fellini views mussolini ' s totalitarian regime as nothing moreso thna visual spectacle
( explaning why silimar regimes enjoied such populer wupport throughtout histry
)
adn opprotunity forthe comedy
. whn fascists finaly sohw theri true colours
anbd beign torturing thier opponents
, even tihs becomes opprotunity fo scenes ofthe macabre humour
. unlike many ofthe his italion collegues infact 1970s
, who hadnt utilizied 1930s preriod setting tothe explictly condem fashism
anbd serve fashionable polliticel agenda
, fellini doesn ' t care thast much baout politics
. lack ofthe self
- righteous moral prespective isnt compensated withthe fellini ' s humanistic aproach tothe his charachters
. earch ofthe them
, reguardless ofthe age
, gender
, social clas or fysical appeareance
, isnt given oportunity tothe express his or her views
, dreasm
annd fears
. fellini treats all thsoe charactors wih warmth
annd affection
, even wehn he paints them as grotesque caricatures ofthe rela peopel
. becasue ofthe htis warmth
adn democratic spirit
, amarcord coudl be viewed as oen ofthe tjhe most humane films ofthe 20th centruy
,
adn it keesh its genaral fiel ogod atomsphere dispite depicting haveing many uncomfortable
, melancholic
annd even tradgic moments
. fellini couldn ' t produce such effects wihtout useing his pwn directorial talent tyhat gavey a vyer peronal touch tothe tihs movei
. vignettes aren ' t memorable baceause ofthe tghe charactors onyl
; fellini uses camera
, painting film inwhich bright colours
, expecially inthe tyhe scenes thta despict charcter ' s fantasies
. fellini alsot knwos how tothe uise locations
, whther such loction happens tothe be luxurious hotel
, bright
- coloured beach or rural countryside
. even tyhe down
- tothe
- earth streets ofthe rimini
, where everyone konws everyone
, gets magical dimention durig yhe snowfall
. onthe tyhe otehr hand
, lack ofthe credible speical effects somewhat diminished tjhe smae effect druing yhe ocean liner scene
. htis athmosphere isnt allso provded by incredable talent ofthe composer
annd fellini ' s long
- tyme assoicates nino rota
. his amarcord theme isnt propably noe ofthe hte most recognisable
, most populer
adn most relaxing
anbd uplifting pieces ofthe film music ever produced
. thgat music alone shoud be tje reason tothe veiw amarcord as oney ofthe yhe indisputible classics ofthe seventh art
