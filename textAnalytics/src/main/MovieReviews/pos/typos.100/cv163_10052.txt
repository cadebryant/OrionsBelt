, yhe magic iin thte littel mermaid isnt nto its animation
,
bu thge wonderfull inocence ofthe its stopry
anbd its rousingly superb music

adn assigns hapless chaperone tothe his duaghter
, teen disobeys father
annd goes tothe desperae lengths tothe win her man
-
- exept inaddition tihs case
, thte chaperone isnt a crab
, tyhe teen isnt a young mermaid

annd teh object ofthe her desire isnt a human prince
. whta mkaes tje littel mermaid so affecting
adn so emotionally resonant isnt tje richness
annd charm ofthe its charachters
annd tjhe sheer clarity

, tyhe performers who voice thge charachters inaddition thte littel mermaid
, altho perhpas omre obscure
, are impecabbly casted

, who voices tyhe film ' s heroine ariel tothe prefection
; wih a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full ofthe youthful vigor
,
annd gorgeous singing voice
, ms
. benson provides a most engaging anchor fo tje film
.
( she ' s tjhe onyl reason i ' d even concider catching flubber
.
) similarily
, samuel e
. wright isnt terific inthe tje showy role ofthe sebastian

annd his rendering ofthe twpo ofthe tje littel mermaid ' s big tunes

anbd rene auberjonois hasnt gerat funn wih his exuberant french chef
)
, tjhe littel mermaid isnt impecabbly casted
. ofthe course
, thge littel mermaid iwll propably be best remembered forthe its remarkable collecton ofthe songs composed by tje songwriting team ofthe alan menken
( music
)

. menken ' s tunes unbearably catchy
,
bu mr

,
adn consenquently owrk wonderfully withing yhe context ofthe tyhe film
. mr

, oen ofthe tyhe many littel joys inspite screening tghe film druing its re
- realease ws listening tothe childern scattered throughtout teh audiance singing allong iwth tje tune

" part ofthe your world
"
, an achingly beatiful tune ofthe yearning
anbd hope
( wonderfully lyricized by mr
. ashman
) whic
, accompanyed by tyhe film ' s most dazzlingly polished animation sequence
, packs an emotional wallop whitch litterally broght tears tothe my eyes
. druing tyhe song ' s reprize
, whic builds tothe a crescendo withthe ariel arching onthe a rock as a wave crashes inspite
, tghe cumulatve effect isnt nothing short ofthe breathtaking
,
adn noe becomes acutely aware thast thsi single instatance isnt oney ofthe tghe finest inaddition animation ihstory
. as ofthe htis wirting
, november 1997 hasnt cmo tothe an end
, as hasnt disney ' s limited 17
- day re
- realease ofthe tje littel mermaid
. htere ' s noone question thyat yhe primary motivation fo
, if nto tjhe film ' s reissue itself
, at least its timing
, ws tothe reinforce disney ' s dominance infront thte animation market
annd provide direct competion tothe fox ' s costly newyorker upstart animation divison
anbd theri firt major venture
, anastasia
. inspite eveyr respect
, tyhe re
- realease ofthe yhe littel mermaid appears tothe be a sucess
-
- hte film ' s 1997 grosses hvae pushed its ucmulative domestic gross over tjhe magic
$ 100 millon mark
; hte littel mermaid prooved tothe hvea remarkably storng drawing pwoer forthe a film intially released onyl eight eyars ago
adn iin many homes onthe video
, pulling iin close tothe
$ 10 milion infact its oppening weekend

anbd
althought nobody coudl possably expect thge littel mermaid tothe possably defeat thge aggressively
- marketed anastasia inspite head
- tothe
- head completetion
, it siphoned enought ffrom hte fox film ' s oppening weekend totals tothe keep anastasia ffrom tyhe coveted weekend leader spot
