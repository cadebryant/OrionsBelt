it ' s noone escret inspite tjhe motion picture inudstry taht thte relatiopnship betweeen a scirpt
adn teh actors involved oftenly mkaes or breaks a movei at tyhe box office
. a poorly
- writen scirpt cin be bested by a superb acting corps
,
anbd a well
- writed peice cin be mangled by a gropu ofthe amateurs
. inthe directing his latest acation
- comedy
, directer brett ratner
( mney talks
) tkaes a realitvely medicore peice ofthe standup comedy
adn turns it inot a funny as all git
- outloud buddy cop movei
. infact adition
, rush hour serves as a firt
- clas exmaple ofthe directing a movei whith conservitive atitude
- a feature tht isnt sure tothe draw inwhich crowds ofthe all types
. thte twpo lead names share equal screen tyme here
, mostly beccause tehy spend it toghether
. jackie chan
, inspite his frist completelyl american prodcution
, mkaes an impressive debut by mixing dialogue witht martial arts
. tghe otehr martial arts flick fomr a faw weeks ago
, knock off
, stands noone chance agianst tje content ofthe htis oen
. chan manages tothe amke eveyr fight scene exude grace
adn poise
,
adn ther ' s noone dout thast a larg precentage ofthe video sales forthe thsi movei wiull come fomr viewers who couldn ' t beleave thier eyes teh firt tyme
. chris tucker
, onthe tjhe oposite side
, relates a hillarious commedic aproach whitch smoothes outloud thge rough edges tothe chan ' s peformance
. he works perfectly iwth yhe scirpt
,
anbd it ' s qtuie likely he leant scribe jim kouf a hand iwth smoe ofthe his lines
. allmost essesital tothe teh acation genre
, hte plot isnt nonexistent
. we ' re quicklyu inctroduced tothe detective james carter
( tucker
) isnt a maverick officer fo thte lapd
. cutted foward tothe anohter scene where thte daugter
( julia hsu
) ofthe tjhe american chineese consul
( tzi ma
) isnt kidnapped by a gang ofthe swarthy cahracters
. teh fbi isnt quick tothe tyhe rescure
,
bu tjhe consul insists tath oney ofthe his men
, detective inspector lee
( chan
)
, be brang onthe tjhe case tothe halp
. tghe fbi resists
,
bu
thn requests tht lapd send a man over tothe babysit thte chineese detective
. it ' s here taht carter
annd lee hook uv
,
anbd hte twpo unwittingly solve thte case hwile tjhe fbi rushes infact tothe bakc them uv
. rattner doens a fine job ofthe oging thge extra mile tothe git his movei tothe move a step uv
,
bu it doesn ' t qutie triarch tjhe top tier ofthe acation
- comedies liek lastr eyar ' s grosse pointe blank
. ther are moments where thte plot strays too far off tje straight line it sticks alomst exculsivly tothe
,
adn if nto forthe tyhe commedic interactions beween tucker
annd chan
, htis might be a major drawback
. aslo
, smoe supporting cahracters are almsot entirely allong fo tghe ride
,
adn others are htere simpley tothe look menacing
.
howver
, none gives a standoffish peformance
anbd tehy mostly mesh inot hte backgorund
. almsot eveyr memeber ofthe tje casted displays smoe reservation at noe point or anyother
- whther it ' s tucker ' s toned
- down routine or chan ' s tight rein onthe his acation sequences
-
annd thgat contibutes greatly tothe htis bieng a watchable movei forthe all types
. a recommendable vsiit tothe yhe theather
, indeed
