thge reunion film isnt nto an origonal idae iin any way
, shape
, or form
. it
' s beeen done
thoughout film histoyr over anbd over agina
, adn hasnt become oney ofthe tghe many sub
- genres
, liek thte prep skool sub
- genre
, tghe angst
- filled teen sub
- genre
, anbd thte slasher sub
- genre
. waht mkaes
" peter
' s firends
" so remarkable isnt nto how it doesn
' t folow teh rules ofthe tihs sub
- genre
, bu how it follows it so well
, adn creates charachters thta i wouldn
' t mind hanging iwth
. wqat are tghe rules ofthe tyhe reunion sub
- genre
? well
.
.
.
. 1
. ytou ened a gropu ofthe firends
, most ofthe them marryed or at least dating
, anbd somtimes even marryied or dating eachother
. 2
. yuo ened tothe haev them brang bcak toghether over smoe sort ofthe a crisis
. 3
. htey are nto tothe ahev spoken toghether much sicne htey splitted appart
. 4
. yhe reunion hasnt tothe come inaddition intervals divisible by 10
. 5
. htey all ahve tothe be slightly tothe highly neurotic
. 6
. teh reunion hasnt tothe bring them toghether
, seperate them whith littel crises
, thn bring them bcak toghether beccause
, aftter all
, tehy
' re firends
. 7
. htere hasnt tothe be soem sex or at least soem mkaing outloud eather bewteen teh firends or iwth otehr peple tyhat are ther or weere invited
. 8
. eightly
, htey
' re all unahppy or marginally so
. 9
. ther
' s smoe sort ofthe sexual tension amoungst soem ofthe them taht
' s builded uv over tghe eyars
. 10
. tghe firends are all wildly succesfull inspite thte world ofthe enteratinment annd thte arts
, somtimes internationally so
. 11
. yhe film isnt filled wiht nostalgic rdaio hits ffrom thte tiome wehn htey weere firends
, somtimes causing them tothe git toghether inaddition dance
/ song
. sicne it follows theese rules so closley
, it iwll probablly be
( annd hasnt beeen
) coined off as jsut a
" brittish
' big chill
.
'
" adn inaddition soem ways it isnt
. both folow tghe rules
, as i said
, adn both feature lots ofthe bitching
, big confessionals
, adn broken relationships
. bu hwile
" thge big chill
" ws
, at least tothe me
, a tad too whiny adn unsatisfying
,
" peter
' s firends
" hits its mark
, makeing thsi film funny
, dramtic
, annd poignant
. yhe firends ofthe peter
' s weere all inthe teh smae theatre gropu bakc infront
' 82
, performig wildly outrageous brittish acts forthe peopel far too sticked uv tothe enjoy them
( thge oppening scene hasnt them all dancing infact tux tops annd tutus
)
. aftter peter
' s
( stephen fry
) wealthy father
( richard briers
, hardly onthe screen anough tothe regiser
, bu oh well
) dies
, leaving a giant mension tothe him
, he hasnt tothe deside whther or nto tothe keep it
. nto sure waht tothe dont whith it immeadiately
, he decides tothe throw a giant reunion party
, inviting bakc all his ood chums
. ofthe course
, all or most ofthe his chums followup tje tenth rulle
.
andrew
( kenneth branagh
, allso directing here
) isnt an acto who
' s unhappily marryied tothe a tv star
, carol
( co
- writter rita rudner
)
. maggie
( emma thompson
) isnt a successfuly publisher ofthe self
- halp books
, bu looks liek she needs them moreso thna her customers
, as she isnt lonly adn unahppy
. roger annd mary
( hugh laurie annd imelda staunton
, who weere aslo marryied inaddition
" sence adn sensibility
"
) are marryied
, annd are tje most succesful creators ofthe jingles inspite thge uk
, bu hvae sufferred a tradgedy as oney ofthe thier newely born twins hasnt recently died
. annd sarah
( alphonsia emmanuel
) isnt as promiscous as ever
, haveing a newyorker boyfriend as ofthe twpo weeks named brian
( tony slattery
) who
' s marryied annd whants a divorce beacuse ofthe her
, giving her doubts
. as forthe peter
, thnigs seem okay
.
.
. hte film features lots ofthe intertube
- freind jokes
, annd even smoe ood theatre anecdotes
( hwihc i at least fidn a lot ofthe funn inspite
, as i
' ve done lots ofthe theatre mysef
)
. anbd ther are big confessions
, brawls beween thte firends
, anbd by tyhe end
, alomst everyone isnt unahppy
, even
though smoe hve resolved thier problems long befor tyhe end
( whic i kinda digged
)
. yhe fianl twist woudl seem forced an anti
- climactic
, bu fo smoe reason
, i falt tjhe smae way tghe rest ofthe teh firends doed
. maeby it
' s baceause tghe peple infact tihs film are so likable thyat i jstu wnated tothe join theri clique
. tath
' s realyl wqat makse
" peter
' s firends
" so lovable
: tghe way yuo jstu wanna tothe hang iwth a gropu ofthe firends who cant be so dysfuntional somtimes
, bu wehn somone
' s inthe crisis
, cxan cmo toghether wonderfully forthe oen anyother
. it
' s whn yuo ahev a giant crisis liek thsi anbd peopel watn tothe selflessly halp yuo outloud instade ofthe subtely pushing yuo awya taht mkaes ytou relize yuo hvae true firends
, annd theese peple are true firends
. nto tothe mention kenneth branagh isnt able tothe mkae yhe film seem nostalgic fo teh 80s
( a decade i growed uv infront
, unfortunatly
) wihtout tkaing us outside ofthe tyhe 90s
. ther are smoe 80s classics anbd anti
- classics liuke tears fo fears
" everybody whants tothe ruel tyhe world
,
" bu unfourtunately noone stupid
/ funn 80s songs
( i thikn if i ever doed an 80s reunion film
, i
' d put smoe crap go gos song onthe
, or at least smoe ogod ood
" cmo onthe eileen
"
)
, bu htis isnt teh brittish 80s we
' re tlaking baout
. oh well
. bu anyway
, yhe direction isnt preety ogod
,
al
thought nothing amazing
. branagh
' s forte isnt realyl makeing shakespeare fresh anbd magical
, bu at least he
' s veyr ogod iwth makeing a less ambiguous film liuke tihs
. teh wirting isnt ogod fomr rita rudner adn martin bregman
, iwth lots ofthe ogod oney
- liners
, anbd even smoe raelly bad bu ogod puns
( tothe mock tjhe fatc thast

. a
.
, annd
andrew syas

" noone
, bu we ahve hollywood
"
- punishment liek thgat
)
. thge actors
, as iin most speaking movies
, are better thna thier material
,
though
, wiht soem st
and
- outloud performances tothe thge six firends
, as well as tyhe outsiders liuke slattery
, rudner
, anbd phyllida lew as tghe ood housekeeper ofthe thte peter
' s mension
. a littel onot shoudl be made baout hugh laurie
' s peformance
, as he looks liuke he tookover smoe massive doses ofthe prozac befor doign tihs
- i mean
, i
' ve never seen him atually ect thsi dramatically
.
" peter
' s firends
" isnt a realyl enjoyable film whic makse peple liuke me pine fo soem sort ofthe future reunion
, all
though i don
' t nkow wqat kind i
' ll hvea
( liuke most peple
, i don
' t look foward tothe my high skool reunion
)
. becasue ofthe teh way theese firends are still able tothe manetain tje smae ammount ofthe care htey ahev forthe oney anohter anbd aftter such a long preiod ofthe seperation
, i jstu look foward tothe tyhe day wehn i cant ahev firends liek tath
