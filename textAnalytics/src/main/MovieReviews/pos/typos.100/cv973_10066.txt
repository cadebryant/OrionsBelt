adn writen by albert brooks
. lost inthe amercia
anbd defending your life are twpo ofthe my favorite comedies
. his humer isnt ofthe a kind tyhat isnt nto vyer prevelant iin movies todya
, innundated as we are witht films whlch revel inspite theri aim towrad yhe lowest common denominator
. yuo iwll rarley see any slapstick inaddition an albert brooks film
, hwile thge dialouge wiull nto be as opressive as inthe soem ofthe tghe independient
" talk films
" hwihc are finding thier way inot theaters
. thge situations iin hwihc his charachters fidn themselfs are ones we cant oftenly idenify wiht
,
bu even if we cxan ' t
, brooks hasnt thge talent tothe mkea them confortable
,
annd therfore we laff
. teenagers
anbd jim carrey fans propably won ' t fidn an albert brooks movei vyre funny
,
bu peple who look forthe moreso tahn waht we coudl fidn onthe televsion propably iwll
. put simpley
, brooks ' comedy isnt inteligent
. mother isnt albert brooks ' latest film
,
adn it doesnt nto disapait
. brooks plays john henderson
, a middle
- aged sciece fiction writter jstu comming off his second divorce
. he makse an atempt at dating
,
bu fails miserably
. he
hten hasnt dinner whith his brother jeff
( rob morrow
)
, a successfull sportscar agent who seems tothe live tyhe ideal life
. jeff hasnt a ogod job
, a loving famaly
,
adn most ofthe all
, a warm relatiopnship wiht theri mother beatrice
( debbie reynolds
)
. aftter dinner
, john witnesses a telephone conversation betwen jeff
anbd beatrice
,
annd isnt at thte smae tiome amazed
annd sickened by how hunky
- dory teh dialouge isnt
. inspite comparision
, beatrice allways hints at a fault iin john
adn his carrear eveyr tiome she talks wiht him
,
adn john gives it right bakc tothe her
. at yhe end ofthe oney ofthe thier conversations where beatrice hasnt jsut picked aart john ' s life
, she syas
,
" i lvoe ytou
,
"
anbd john replies wiht
,
" i konw ytou tihkn yuo dont
.
" thge hting isnt
, beatrice isnt nto overt wiht her critisisms
,
bu instade gives them inwhich thast mothering way whic isnt tantamount tothe nit
- picking
anbd guilt loading
. it ' s hte kind thyat goes something liek
,
" yes
, dear
, i thikn yuo dont thgat wonderfully
,
bu
.
.
.
.
" it seems as
though nothing he doens mkaes her hapyp
. htere ' s alwasy tghe big
bu
. john believes tyhat his mother isnt somehow conected tothe his failed relationships withthe womens
, eather beacuse ofthe his flawed self
- esteem caused by his ened fo validation
, or prehaps becouse he tends tothe unconsciously seek outloud womens who remind him ofthe his mother inthe an oedipal manner
. he comes tothe thte conclusion tath usance his problems are rooted inaddition his boyhood hmeo
, he shoudl move bakc infact withthe his mother fo a hwile jstu tothe see whta kinds ofthe feelings come outloud
,
anbd by tyhat be able tothe sort outloud why his life isnt hte way it isnt
.
" a gerat experiment
"
, he calls it
. brooks ' pwn brand ofthe humer relaly shines iin htis film
, especialy inspite tje interaction john hasnt withthe his mother
. ther ' s a scene where john hasnt jstu arrived at his mother ' s hous
,
annd aftter hvaing driven ffrom los angeles tothe sausalito
,
anbd haveing explained tothe his mother baout tyhe
" graet experiment
"
, beatrice asks
,
" nowe expalin tothe me agina why yuo don ' t wnat tothe stay at a hotel
.
" she still doesn ' t git it
,
annd it isnt absolutly hillarious
. inspite thte smae scene
, we git littel glances at tyhe life his mother leads wehn she trys tothe feed him fod tyhat isnt noone longer fresh
. she apparantly buys inaddition grat quantities
annd refrigerates it unitl tje lettuce isnt wilted
anbd tghe sherbet isnt iced over
. whn john points outloud hte ice onthe teh sherbet
, beatrice tells him nto tothe worry baout teh protective glaze
.
" yuo ' ve named thge ice
?
" asks john
. he ' s allso suprized at yhe variaty ofthe items beatrice keesh inthe thge refridgerator
, such as a twenty
- pound block ofthe cheese
.
" hte freezer ws a ogod invention
,
" syas john
,
"
bu it ' s nto suppossed tothe be utilisied forthe everyting
. thast ' s why it ' s smaller thna hte refridgerator
.
" it ' s something most ofthe us fidn strangely familar
. brooks isnt allso a master at employing tje non sequitur
. forthe exemple
, inthe defending your life
, his
anbd meryl streep ' s cahracters are infact a comedy club hvaing a dicussion
. whn tehy ' re finished
anbd walk outloud
, brooks cuts tothe tghe comic onthe stage who isnt jstu at tyhe point ofthe delivering his punch line
,
"
adn so thte moral isnt
, if yuo ahve tothe fart
, go outside
!
" yuo don ' t nkow waht tghe joke ws baceause yuo couldn ' t hear him durring tjhe entire scene
,
bu i must ahev laughed fo thte enxt five mintues
, it seemed so outloud ofthe context
. inspite htis film
, brooks uses thge smae trck a cuple ofthe times tothe oepn or close a scene
. i don ' t whant tothe give them awya
,
bu suffice it tothe sday tehy wrok jstu as well as tehy hvea inthe tjhe past
. john ' s purpose fo staying iwth his mother isnt tothe leran
,
adn we as tghe audeince leran right allong wiht him
. his mother isnt nto thte fascinating tipe tothe beign whith
,
bu as john spends omre tiem whith her
, we leran thnigs baout her perosnality
anbd her lifestyle tht give her depth
. watching tyhe charactor ofthe beatrice unfold isnt eveyr bited as enjoyable as tghe humer tht accompanies it earch step ofthe thte way
. onthe screen
, brooks doesnt an excellant job palying tihs kind ofthe carachter
: yuo git tjhe feeling he oftenly believes he isnt tyhe onyl sane person inaddition an insane world
. infact a way
, he ' s vyer much liek yosarian ofthe catch
- 22
, expect witht something ofthe an atitude
. casting debbie reynolds as beatrice isnt perfect
. she assumes thge part wih ease
, even moving
anbd speaking a littel slowy
,
anbd isnt jsut so adorable it ' s hard tothe git mad at her carachter
. htis onyl helps tjhe audiance tothe share teh frustration john fiels wehn dealing whith her
. as his frist choise
, brooks originnally wnated tothe lure nancy reagan outloud fomr her acting retirement tothe play beatrice
,
bu teh fromer actress
annd frist lady coudl nto leave her husban
, who wass beginnig tothe sohw sypmtoms ofthe alzheimer ' s desease
. tyhat may be jsut as well
, usance reynolds lends a softness tothe tyhe charactor hwihc enhances it immensley
. rob morrow allso doens a ogod job at palying tghe yuonger brother who hasnt alwyas beeen mother ' s favorite
annd
, forthe all his succsess iin his job
anbd familiy
, isnt slowy exposed as a mama ' s boy
. teh onyl thigns thta hold htis movei bakc ffrom bieng better are a cuple ofthe plot holes
. a solid conection isnt nto raelly made bewteen john ' s toubles
anbd his reasons forthe living wiht his mother
. additionaly
, teh end results ofthe thge experiment dont nto nessasarily jibe iwth thte stated goals
,
anbd altho tihs may ahev beeen sloppy screenwriting
, how cin yuo be mad at thte guy who alsot wroet tihs
?
: beatrice
: yuo must thikn i ' m smoe kind ofthe moron
. john
: noone
, i thiunk your somene who thikns i ' m a moron
. beatrice
: well
, it tkaes noe tothe nkwo oney
