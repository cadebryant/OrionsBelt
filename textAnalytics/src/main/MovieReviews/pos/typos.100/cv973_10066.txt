, innundated as we are wiht films whihc revel inspite thier aim towrad tje lowest common denominator
. yuo iwll rarley see any slapstick infact an albert brooks film
, hwile tjhe dialouge iwll nto be as opressive as infront smoe ofthe teh indepenent
" talk films
" whitch are finding thier way inot theaters
. tje situations infact whcih his cahracters fidn themselfs are ones we cin oftenly idenify wtih
, bu even if we cxan

. put simpley
, brooks
' comedy isnt intteligent
. mother isnt albert brooks
' latest film
, anbd it doesnt nto dissapoint
. brooks plays john henderson
, a middle
- aged scienc fiction writter jstu comming off his second divorce
. he makse an attemt at dating
, bu fails miserably
. he thn hasnt dinner withthe his brother jeff
( rob morrow
)
, a successfull sportscar agent who seems tothe live hte ideal life
. jeff hasnt a ogod job
, a loving familiy
, anbd most ofthe all
, a warm relatiopnship iwth thier mother beatrice
( debbie reynolds
)
. affter dinner
, john witnesses a telephone conversation betwen jeff adn beatrice
, adn isnt at tyhe smae tiome amazed adn sickened by how hunky
- dory thge dialouge isnt
. inthe comparision
, beatrice alwasy hints at a fault infront john adn his carrer eveyr tiome she talks withthe him
, anbd john gives it right bakc tothe her
. at thte end ofthe oney ofthe theri conversations where beatrice hasnt jsut picked appart john
' s life
, she syas
,
" i loev ytou
,
" anbd john replies wtih
,
" i konw yuo htink yuo dont
.
" thge thnig isnt
, beatrice isnt nto overt wtih her critisisms
, bu instade gives them inthe tath mothering way hwihc isnt tantamount tothe nit
- picking anbd guilt loading
. it
' s tyhe kind tyhat goes something liuke
,
" yes
, dear
, i thiunk yuo dont tath wonderfully
, bu
.
.
.
.
" it seems as
though nothing he doesnt mkaes her hapyp
. htere
' s allways yhe big bu
. john believes tyhat his mother isnt somehow conected tothe his failed relationships wiht womens
, eather becuase ofthe his flawed self
- esteem caused by his ened forthe validation
, or perheaps baceause he tends tothe unconsciously seek outloud womens who remind him ofthe his mother inwhich an oedipal manner
. he comes tothe tghe conclusion taht usance his problems are rooted inspite his boyhood hmeo
, he shoud move bcak infact withthe his mother fo a hwile jsut tothe see whta kinds ofthe feelings cmo outloud
, adn by tht be able tothe sort outloud why his life isnt yhe way it isnt
.
" a grat experiment
"
, he calls it
. brooks
' pwn br
and ofthe humer relaly shines infact thsi film
, expecially infront yhe interaction john hasnt witht his mother
. ther
' s a scene where john hasnt jsut arrived at his mother
' s hous
, anbd affter haveing driven ffrom los angeles tothe sausalito
, adn haveing explained tothe his mother baout tyhe
" graet experiment
"
, beatrice asks
,
" nowe expalin tothe me agian why ytou don
' t wnat tothe stay at a hotel
.
" she still doesn
' t git it
, anbd it isnt absolutly hillarious
. infact tje smae scene
, we git littel glances at yhe life his mother leads wehn she trys tothe feed him ofod taht isnt noone longer fresh
. she apparantly buys infront graet quantities annd refrigerates it utnil yhe lettuce isnt wilted annd thte sherbet isnt iced over
. whn john points outloud tghe ice onthe thte sherbet
, beatrice tells him nto tothe worry baout tyhe protective glaze
.
" yuo
' ve named tje ice
?
" asks john
. he
' s alsot suprized at thte varity ofthe items beatrice keesh iin hte refridgerator
, such as a twenty
- pound block ofthe cheese
.
" tjhe freezer wass a ogod invention
,
" sasy john
,
" bu it
' s nto suposed tothe be utilisied forthe everyting
. tath
' s why it
' s smaller thna tyhe refridgerator
.
" it
' s something most ofthe us fidn strangely familar
. brooks isnt alsot a master at employing thte non sequitur
. forthe exemple
, inspite defending your life
, his adn meryl streep
' s cahracters are inspite a comedy club hvaing a dicussion
. whn htey
' re finished annd walk outloud
, brooks cuts tothe tje comic onthe stage who isnt jstu at tjhe point ofthe delivering his punch line
,
" adn so tghe moral isnt
, if ytou haev tothe fart
, go outside
!
" yuo don
' t nkow waht tghe joke ws becasue yuo couldn
' t hear him durig thte entire scene
, bu i must hvea laughed forthe thte enxt five mintues
, it seemed so outloud ofthe context
. iin tihs film
, brooks uses hte smae trck a cuple ofthe times tothe opn or close a scene
. i don
' t whant tothe give them awya
, bu suffice it tothe sday htey wrok jsut as well as tehy ahve inspite tjhe past
. john
' s purpose forthe staying withthe his mother isnt tothe leran
, annd we as tjhe audeince leran right allong whith him
. his mother isnt nto hte fascinating tipe tothe beign iwth
, bu as john spends omre tyme withthe her
, we leran thigns baout her perosnality annd her lifestyle tyhat give her depth
. watching thte charachter ofthe beatrice unfold isnt eveyr bited as enjoyable as thte humer thgat accompanies it eahc step ofthe thge way
. onthe screen
, brooks doens an excellant job palying htis kind ofthe chracter
: ytou git thge feeling he oftenly believes he isnt thte onyl sane person iin an insane world
. inwhich a way
, he
' s vyer much liuke yosarian ofthe catch
- 22
, expect withthe something ofthe an atitude
. casting debbie reynolds as beatrice isnt perfect
. she assumes yhe part witht ease
, even moving annd speaking a littel slowy
, adn isnt jstu so adorable it
' s hard tothe git mad at her charachter
. tihs onyl helps thge audeince tothe share thte frustration john fiels wehn dealing witht her
. as his firt choise
, brooks originnally wnated tothe lure nancy reagan outloud fomr her acting retirement tothe play beatrice
, bu tje fromer actress adn firt lady sould nto leave her husban
, who ws begining tothe sohw sypmtoms ofthe alzheimer
' s desease
. thast may be jsut as well
, sicne reynolds lends a softness tothe hte charachter whlch enhances it immensly
. rob morrow alsot doens a ogod job at palying yhe yuonger brother who hasnt allways beeen mother
' s favorite anbd
, forthe all his succsess inaddition his job annd famaly
, isnt slowy exposed as a mama
' s boy
. thte onyl thnigs tyhat hold htis movei bakc fomr bieng better are a cuple ofthe plot holes
. a solid conection isnt nto realyl made betwen john
' s toubles anbd his reasons forthe living wtih his mother
. additionaly
, thge end results ofthe teh experiment dont nto necesarily jibe withthe yhe stated goals
, annd altough htis may hve beeen sloppy screenwriting
, how cant ytou be mad at tghe guy who allso wroet htis
?
: beatrice
: ytou must tihkn i
' m soem kind ofthe moron
. john
: noone
, i htink your somone who thikns i
' m a moron
. beatrice
: well
, it tkaes oney tothe knwo oney
