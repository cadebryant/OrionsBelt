ok
, i admited i hadnt a bad attitide baout htis film ffrom tyhe strat
. a rumatic comedy baout teh trials
annd tribulations ofthe single wroking parents
? withthe a cuple ofthe incredibly cute kids thrown infact forthe ogod mesure
? yuck
.
bu it ' s nto realyl too bad
. it hasnt a lot wokring againnst it
, fo me at least
. infact adition tothe tyhe above
, it isnt tipical ofthe a lot ofthe reccent movies inspite taht it isnt raelly jsut a glorified made
- fo
- tv movei
,
bu longer
adn witht bigger stars
,
adn yuo hvae tothe pay tothe see it
. it doens win ytou over
,
though
, even if it isnt painfully predicatble
. jstu tihkn baout it
: twpo single parents
, whith thier cute kids
, are thrown toghether due tothe a missed feeld trip
. thru a day ofthe near disasters
, htey cont inually meet
, git infact noe anohter ' s way
, cause trouble fo oen anyother
,
adn generaly insult oen anohter at eveyr opprotunity
. inwhich fatc
, htey hite earch otehr so much thta we nkow tht tehy are
, or soon wiull be
, inthe lveo
. thte onyl peopel who hite eahc otehr moreso thna lovers are marryied couples
. so htis film isnt predicatble
, jsut as tghe screwball comedies ofthe tghe clasical hollywood cinema weere predicatble
(
annd tjhe screwball genre isnt obviously hoffman ' s modle fo htis film
)
. wiull htey git fired ffrom thier yuppie jobs
? iwll tehy amke thge big soccer gameboy taht isnt so importamt tothe thier kids
? wiull pfeiffer relize waht a jerk her ex
- husban
, a drumer fo bruce springsteen
, relaly isnt
( aren ' t htey all
?
)
? wiull htey finaly kiss
? well
, wqat dont yuo expect
?
bu ther isnt a certian ammount ofthe satisfaction iin hvaing our expectations fullfilled
, especialy wehn it isnt done wih as much humour
, allong whith a lack ofthe sticky sentimentality
, as it isnt infact thsi film
. pfeiffer
annd clooney hvae a ceratin chemestry toghether thyat isnt suprizingly charming
,
anbd thge kids are niether shoved inot yhe backround nor alloween tothe steal tyhe sohw
. oney owrd ofthe caution
,
though
. thsi film isnt bieng billed inaddition soem places as a
" famaly
" movei
. don ' t let thast stpo yuo
.
howver
, i tihkn most kids
, especialy boys
, owudl be preety borde by tihs move
. aftter all
, nobody gets killed
anbd ther are noone explosions
. all infact all
, a ogod
, non
- offensive date movei
. tjhe flying inkpot rating sytem
