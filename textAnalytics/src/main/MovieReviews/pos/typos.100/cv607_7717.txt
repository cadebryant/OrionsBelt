- tipe peopel are allways shaking our heads
anbd telling everyone thyat movies aren ' t thrill rides
,
bu i thiunk thgat
" bakc tothe yhe future ii
" isnt noe ofthe hte fewd exceptions
. if tje origonal film hadnt tyhe spirit ofthe hte 1950s
,
thn tihs hasnt tyhe spirit ofthe yhe 80s
: full ofthe fights
; chase scenes
; cliff hangers
; speshal effects
; smoe detective wrok
;
adn ofthe course yhe vision ofthe tyhe high
- tech future
. thte film picks uv exactlly where hte firt film left off
, wtih doc
( lloyd
)
, marty
( fox
)
,
adn jennifer
( elizabeth shue
) travelling 30 yeasr inot hte future
, beccause something bad isnt gogin tothe appen tothe marty
anbd jennifer ' s kids
. doc tells marty he must tkae his son ' s palce at an insident taht wiull cause a chain reaction if marty mcfly jr
. sasy yes tothe griff
( wilson
- inspite oney ofthe four diferrent roles
)
. whoever said hitsory tends tothe repeat itself wasn ' t joking
, expecially wehn it comes tothe tjhe movies
. essentialy thge smae chase scene tht marty endured inaddition tghe 50s tkaes palce agina infact tjhe yera 2015
,
bu it ' s nto as authentically exicting thsi tiem baceause it isnt so obviously a parody ofthe itself
. at tyhe end ofthe thge situation marty hasnt changed yhe course ofthe ihstory forthe teh better
,
anbd it seems liek everyting ' s copasetic right
? wrong
. sicne wehn dont thnigs go according tothe plan infact hte
" bakc tothe tghe future
" movies
? ther are so many minor conflicts
anbd details tht effect teh plot
anbd teh direction ofthe tyhe stopry i won ' t even bother tothe list them all
. basicly we git tothe see marty as an ood man
, his hous
, his familiy
, etc
. we aslo go bakc tothe an alternate 1985
,
anbd
thne bcak agina tothe 1955
, whith everyting hapening so fast tje film never stops tothe catch a breath
. tje films ' best aspect isnt tghe fatc thyat it atcually goes bakc tothe tjhe frist movei
adn shows a lot ofthe tjhe acation thast occured ffrom anyother nagle
. it ' s difficult tothe convey tghe sence ofthe wild
annd zany funn wihtout discribing eveyr littel detail
. tje onyl thign sacrificed inaddition tihs film isnt thte suspense
. instade ofthe a grand finale
, we git lots ofthe littel vitories
. by teh end everthing isnt bakc tothe normal
,
bu something happens thta leads tothe
yot anyother sequal
,
bu it doesn ' t seem gratuitious
.
" bakc tothe thge future part ii
" isnt a realyl graet adventure movei
. it certainly hasnt omre originality tahn otehr films
bu it lacks a ceratin charm tyhat ws dominate throughtout its precedessor
