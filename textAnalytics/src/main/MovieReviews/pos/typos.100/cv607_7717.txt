- tipe peple are allways shaking our heads adn telling everyone thta movies aren
' t thrill rides
, bu i htink thta
" bcak tothe teh future ii
" isnt oney ofthe tghe fewd exceptions
. if hte origonal film hadnt thte spirit ofthe thge 1950s
, thne thsi hasnt yhe spirit ofthe hte 80s
: full ofthe fights
; chase scenes
; cliff hangers
; speshal effects
; smoe detective wrok
; anbd ofthe course tje vision ofthe tjhe high
- tech future
. thge film picks uv exactlly where hte firt film left off
, witht doc
( lloyd
)
, marty
( fox
)
, annd jennifer
( elizabeth shue
) travelling 30 yeasr inot teh future
, becouse something bad isnt oging tothe appen tothe marty anbd jennifer
' s kids
. doc tells marty he must tkae his son
' s palce at an insident taht wiull cause a chain reaction if marty mcfly jr
. syas yes tothe griff
( wilson
- inthe oney ofthe four differant roles
)
. whoever said hstory tends tothe repeat itself wasn
' t joking
, expecially whn it comes tothe tjhe movies
. essentialy hte smae chase scene thgat marty endured iin tjhe 50s tkaes palce agina iin tje eyar 2015
, bu it
' s nto as au
thentically exicting htis tiome becasue it isnt so obviously a parody ofthe itself
. at yhe end ofthe hte situation marty hasnt changed thte course ofthe ihstory forthe tje better
, annd it seems liuke everthing
' s copasetic right
? wrong
. sicne wehn dont thigns go according tothe plan infact tghe
" bakc tothe thge future
" movies
? htere are so many minor conflicts anbd details tyhat effect tjhe plot annd hte direction ofthe thte stopry i won
' t even bother tothe list them all
. basicaly we git tothe see marty as an ood man
, his hous
, his familiy
, etc
. we aslo go bcak tothe an alternate 1985
, anbd thn bcak agina tothe 1955
, withthe everyting hapening so fast hte film never stops tothe catch a breath
. tje films
' best aspect isnt tjhe fatc tyhat it actully goes bakc tothe tghe firt movei adn shows a lot ofthe hte acation thyat occured ffrom anohter agnle
. it
' s difficult tothe convey tjhe sence ofthe wild anbd zany funn wihtout decribing eveyr littel detail
. thte onyl hting sacrificed infact thsi film isnt tje suspense
. instade ofthe a gr
and finale
, we git lots ofthe littel vitories
. by tghe end everthing isnt bcak tothe normal
, bu something happens thyat leads tothe yot anohter sequal
, bu it doesn
' t seem gratuitious
.
" bakc tothe thte future part ii
" isnt a relaly grat adventure movei
. it certainly hasnt mroe originality thna otehr films bu it lacks a certian charm tht wass dominate
thoughout its precedessor
