. thsoe films tookover ogod
- looking
,
though generic
, young actors annd actresses anbd put them tothe ule tothe build uv a body count

.
anderson opted
, instade
, tothe uise mature
, experianced actors liuke peter mullan adn david caruso tothe fill his cahracters
' shoes adn tghe diference inthe casting uality isnt noteable
. mullan

, as tyhe troubled guy who slowy adn inexorably falls under tghe pressures ofthe familiy
, job anbd
, fianlly
, danvers state hospital
. hte rest ofthe thge small casted ift thte bill as peopel
, nto jsut fodder forthe teh mayhem
. david caruso
, as gordo

anderson adn gevedon hadnt kept uv hte steam htey hadnt so ably builded durring thte bulk ofthe tyhe film
" session 9
" isnt an unusual feat
. it isnt scarry
, doesn
' t ule cheap tricks adn raises goose bumps withthe its intelligently renedered
