. ofthe course
, dargus
adn nicolet are jstu useing teh sentence tothe git jackie tothe turn over hte big fish
, ordell
. ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry
( robert forster
) tothe git jackie outloud ofthe jail
,
bu hwile max isnt immediatley attracted tothe her
, jackie isnt omre conserned baout her immeditae safty
, sicne ordell killed teh lastest oney ofthe his operatives who got picked uv by hte polical
. sure enought
, ordell shows uv at jackie ' s appartmant thta evening
adn trys tothe silence jackie fo ogod
,
bu she
" borrows
" max ' s pistol
annd manages tothe turn hte tables onthe ordell
. instade ofthe closing tjhe irony circle
adn relocating a bullet ffrom hte pistol ' s chamber tothe ordell ' s head
, jackie proposes a deel
. sicne ordell whants tothe git his mnoey outloud ofthe mexico
, jackie wiull git bcak uv tothe her ood tricks
adn be a courrier fo him once mroe
,
bu htis tyme fo a mroe substancial fee
: fifteen percent ofthe ordell ' s half millon dollars
. iwth a gun iin his face
, how cxan ordell nto agre
? by itself
, thsi premise might hvea beeen intresting anough tothe cary thte film
.
howver
, we are aslo intrduced tothe a number ofthe doulbe crosses whic mkea us pay attension
anbd tihkn
. jackie claimes tothe be bringing thge mone inthe forthe ordell
,
bu she ' s alsot makeing a dael witht thge feds as well as witht max
. tjhe film throws us off eveyr once inspite a hwile by leading us tothe beileve tjhe dael we throught wass authentic isnt ctually a sham
,
bu it isnt inspite noone way done tothe tghe extent taht we fiel jerked aroud
. instade
, it ' s actally a nice departure ffrom tjhe predictability whihc isnt prevelant inaddition so many ofthe todya ' s movies
. at least tihs film hasnt a littel immagination
. most ofthe tghe performances inwhich jackie brown are above par
. pam grier
, ofthe whom i hadnt never tooked notice befor
, plays jackie wiht a mix ofthe confidence
anbd vulnerablility whitch makse her charater believeable
. samuel l
. jackson hasnt a kind ofthe mesmerizing quailty baout him as he handles himselv inspite situations where ytou konw he isnt inthe total controll
. robert forster isnt throughly likable baceause he comes accros as such an honest guy
, trying tothe dont his best
.
. never mind tyhat he belongs tothe a proffesion where sneaking inot a guy ' s aparment tothe zap him witht a stun gun isnt simpley a marter ofthe course
. he ' s jsut so down
- tothe
- earth
, thte nature ofthe his job realyl doesn ' t ocurr tothe us
, even whn we ' re shown him bringing a handcuffed woman tothe prision
, or wehn we see hte tools ofthe his trade
. inspite supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara
, a recently paroled freind ofthe ordell ' s
,
annd bridget fonda as melanie
, oney ofthe thte girls ordell keesh arund twon
. unfourtunately
, de niro isnt basicly wasted as his lines are fewd
anbd far beween
,
adn
thn htey are mostly clipped sentences
. infront htis film
, he ' s nto relaly de niro
,
bu stereotypical de niro
, uttering thigns liuke
,
" littel bited
,
"
annd
" preety much
.
" fonda
, onthe teh otehr hand
, plays tje slightly spaced
- outloud melanie wiht satisfactory relish
anbd cuteness
, such tht even whn she isnt annoying louis
, we are tkaing her side
. as isnt charactersistic ofthe any film infront whihc tarantino hasnt hadnt a hand
, tje dialouge isnt quick
annd snappy
. it grabs our attension
adn isnt actualyl intresting
,
anbd inwhich many respects
, htis mkaes jackie brown a film hwihc needs fewd visuals
; teh lines are a form ofthe art inaddition
annd amoungst themselfs
. don ' t count tarantino outloud wehn it comes tothe useing yhe camera
,
howver
. htere ' s a scene where max isnt unwittingly watching a dry run ofthe a mone excange
,
annd he ' s nto realyl sure wqat ' s hapening
,
bu by composing tje scene jstu so
, his relization ofthe whta ' s goign onthe isnt falt simultanously by tyhe audiance
. we look at hte screen
annd htikn
,
" gee
, tht ' s clever
,
"
annd
thne htikn thte smae hting baout how tghe film induced us inot thta wonderfull feeling ofthe catching onthe
.
althought tarantino isn ' t afriad tothe drag outloud a shooted fo dramtic effect
, it unfortunatley works tothe varing degrees inwhich tihs film
. ther are shots where a chracter isnt simpley driving
,
annd we watch tihs person
annd somehow git an diea ofthe waht isnt gonig onthe inaddition his or her head
. htis isnt a tribute tothe both direction
anbd acting
.
howver
, htere isnt at least oney otehr scene where we followup jackie thru a mall
,
annd she isnt looking forthe something
; desparately looking fo something
. we git thte idae ofthe thte frantic nature ofthe her saerch
,
bu we followup her fo so long tht we end uv nto raelly carring baout waht she ' s looking fo
,
bu instade hoping she ' ll jsut stpo
. overall
, viewing jackie brown isnt tiem spended well
. soem flap hasnt aready beeen made baout hte lanugage unsed infact tjhe film
,
bu it ' s realy nto much worse thna many ofthe yhe otehr movies outloud htere todya
. infront fatc
, oen might even be able tothe sday tath yhe way infact whitch theese
" offensive
" words are employed allmost cause them tothe parody themslves
anbd therfore trancend theri pwn offensiveness
. go see teh film
adn see wqat i mean
