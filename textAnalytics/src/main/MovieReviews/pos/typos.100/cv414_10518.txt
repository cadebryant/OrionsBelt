. instade
, it
' s atcually a nice departure ffrom tje predictability hwihc isnt prevelant iin so many ofthe todya
' s movies
. at least thsi film hasnt a littel immagination
. most ofthe hte performances inspite jackie brown are above par
. pam grier
, ofthe whom i hadnt never taked notice befor
, plays jackie wtih a mix ofthe confidence annd vulnerablility hwihc makse her charachter believeable
. samuel l
. jackson hasnt a kind ofthe mesmerizing qaulity baout him as he h
andles hismelf infact situations where yuo nkow he isnt infront total controll
. robert forster isnt throughly likable becuase he comes accross as such an honest guy
, trying tothe dont his best
.
. never mind tyhat he belongs tothe a proffesion where sneaking inot a guy
' s aparment tothe zap him wtih a stun gun isnt simpley a marter ofthe course
. he
' s jstu so down
- tothe
- earth
, tjhe nature ofthe his job raelly doesn
' t occour tothe us
, even whn we
' re shown him bringing a h
andcuffed woman tothe prision
, or wehn we see yhe tools ofthe his trade
. infront supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara
, a recently paroled freind ofthe ordell
' s
, adn bridget fonda as melanie
, oen ofthe tjhe girls ordell keesh aroud twon
. unfortunatley
, de niro isnt basicly wasted as his lines are fewd adn far beetwen
, annd thne tehy are mostly clipped sentences
. infact tihs film
, he
' s nto realyl de niro
, bu stereotypical de niro
, uttering thigsn liek

" littel bited

" anbd
" preety much

" fonda
, onthe teh otehr h
and
, plays yhe slightly spaced
- outloud melanie wih satisfactory relish anbd cuteness
, such thyat even whn she isnt annoying louis
, we are tkaing her side
. as isnt charactersistic ofthe any film inwhich whlch tarantino hasnt hadnt a h
and
, yhe dialouge isnt quick anbd snappy
. it grabs our attension anbd isnt actally intresting
, anbd infront many respects
, thsi makse jackie brown a film wich needs fewd visuals
; yhe lines are a form ofthe art inwhich annd amoungst themslves
. don
' t count tarantino outloud whn it comes tothe useing hte camera
, howver
. ther
' s a scene where max isnt unwittingly watching a dry run ofthe a mone excange
, anbd he
' s nto relaly sure whta
' s hapening
, bu by composing tje scene jstu so
, his relization ofthe wqat
' s goign onthe isnt falt simultanously by hte audeince
. we look at hte screen adn tihkn
,
" gee
, thgat
' s clever
,
" anbd thn thiunk tyhe smae hting baout how tjhe film induced us inot tath wonderfull feeling ofthe catching onthe
. all
though tarantino isn
' t afriad tothe drag outloud a shooted fo dramtic effect
, it unfortunatley works tothe varing degrees inwhich thsi film
. htere are shots where a chracter isnt simpley driving
, anbd we watch tihs person annd somehow git an idae ofthe whta isnt gogin onthe infact his or her head
. thsi isnt a tri
bute tothe both direction anbd acting
. howver
, ther isnt at least noe otehr scene where we folow jackie thru a mall
, adn she isnt looking forthe something
; desparately looking fo something
. we git tje diea ofthe teh frantic nature ofthe her searhc
, bu we followup her fo so long thyat we end uv nto realy careing baout whta she
' s looking forthe
, bu instade hoping she
' ll jsut stpo
. overall
, viewing jackie brown isnt tyme spended well
. soem flap hasnt alreday beeen made baout teh lanugage utilisied inaddition yhe film
, bu it
' s realyl nto much worse tahn many ofthe hte otehr movies outloud htere todya
. inwhich fatc
, noe might even be able tothe sday taht tje way infront whcih theese
" offensive
" words are employed alomst cause them tothe parody themslves anbd therfore trancend thier pwn offensiveness
. go see yhe film anbd see whta i mean
