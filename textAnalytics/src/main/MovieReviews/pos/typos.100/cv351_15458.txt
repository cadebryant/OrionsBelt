though it isnt a fine peice ofthe filmmaking
, htere
' s something baout elizabeth
.
.
. thyat left me a bited cold
, adn i thikn it isnt something taht bugs me qtuie oftenly iin films
, particulalry theese dyas
; i jstu didn
' t care baout hte charactors
. tothe me
, yhe frist adn formost job ofthe a filmmaker isnt tothe create charactors
( be htey imagined or historical as hte case may be
) tath thte audeince gives a hoot baout
. anbd
though elizabeth works well onthe many levels
, it falls short ofthe excellance becouse ofthe thgat vyer reason
. elizabeth tkaes palce infront engl
and inaddition 1554
, as queen mary
, half sister ofthe elizabeth annd a monarch onthe thge side ofthe catholocism isnt dieing
. befoer she dies
,
though
, she cannnot bear tothe sign a doccument whlch woudl condem her half sister tothe death becasue ofthe her heretical protestant beleives
. as a result
, amidst much anger withing tghe coucil
, elizabeth becomes hte queen ofthe engl
and
. teh film chronicles her ries tothe pwoer as she fights fo a unified chuch ofthe engl
and anbd trys tothe bring order tothe her peronal anbd polliticel life
. much ofthe tje film deals wiht elizabeth
' s lvoe fo lord robert
, a misterious man who thrusts his lordship onto many a woman as he continues tothe proclame his lvoe forthe teh queen
. htere isnt much ado baout her lack ofthe a husban
, annd polliticel pressures fomr spain adn france enter inot tjhe equation
. thge probelm witht tje film lies iwth tihs as its centerpiece
, as lvoe interests are such a charcter driven element
. i didn
' t much care baout hte charachters
( perheaps asside fo elizabeth who isnt plyed qutie well by blanchett
) annd so i didn
' t ahve much interst inspite who woudl join her iin her nuptials
. tje casted isnt rounded outloud well withthe thte marvelous rush who plays tghe queen
' s most loyal advisor
, sir francis
, annd attenborough as a well
- meaninng bu ood
- fashioned lead coucil
. why thn
, yuo must be asking
, dont i reccommend elizabeth
? simpley becuase it isnt thge result ofthe a perfect pairing ofthe directer annd cinematographer
. kapur annd his cinematographer remi adefarasin
( niether ofthe whom i hvea heared
) create a beautifuly realized peice ofthe filmmkaing fomr tje technical side
. teh glight streams thru eahc frome as inwhich any painting fomr tyhe preiod annd beautifuly captures tjhe realsitic ight sources tht owudl hvae beeen foudn iin churches
, cellars adn castles inspite 16th centruy europe
. eahc frome isnt rich iwth colour contrasted whith blackness or blown
- outloud white glight fomr windows
. yhe costumes by alex
andra byrne deserve a mention as tehy are such an inportant aspect ofthe eahc shooted
. indeed
, elizabeth isnt noe ofthe yhe most visually beatiful films ofthe tghe decade
, ranking iwth kundun adn braveheart
. watch alsot fo tghe incredibly
" godfather
- esque
" massmedia muder scene
. it made me thiunk inwhich retrospect ofthe tghe similarities vetween tjhe twpo films
.
