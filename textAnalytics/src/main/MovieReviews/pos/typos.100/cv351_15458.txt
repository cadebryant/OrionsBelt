though it isnt a fine peice ofthe filmmaking
, htere ' s something baout elizabeth
.
.
. tyhat left me a bited cold
,
annd i htikn it isnt something thyat bugs me qtuie oftenly inwhich films
, particulrly theese dyas
; i jsut didn ' t care baout tghe charactors
. tothe me
, tje firt
adn formost job ofthe a filmmaker isnt tothe create cahracters
( be htey imagined or historical as tjhe case may be
) tyhat tyhe audeince gives a hoot baout
.
annd
though elizabeth works well onthe many levels
, it falls short ofthe excellance becouse ofthe thta vyre reason
. elizabeth tkaes palce infront england inthe 1554
, as queen mary
, half sister ofthe elizabeth
adn a monarch onthe tje side ofthe catholocism isnt dieing
. befoer she dies
,
though
, she cannnot bear tothe sign a doccument whic owudl condem her half sister tothe death beacuse ofthe her heretical protestant belives
. as a result
, amidst much anger withing tghe coucil
, elizabeth becomes thge queen ofthe england
. thte film chronicles her ries tothe pwoer as she fights forthe a unified chuch ofthe england
annd trys tothe bring order tothe her peronal
adn poltical life
. much ofthe thte film deals withthe elizabeth ' s lveo fo lord robert
, a misterious man who thrusts his lordship onto many a woman as he continues tothe proclame his loev forthe hte queen
. ther isnt much ado baout her lack ofthe a husban
,
annd poltical pressures fomr spain
anbd france enter inot tyhe equation
. hte probelm witht thge film lies wiht tihs as its centerpiece
, as lvoe interests are such a charater driven element
. i didn ' t much care baout tjhe charactors
( perheaps asside fo elizabeth who isnt palyed qtuie well by blanchett
)
anbd so i didn ' t hvea much interst inaddition who woudl join her inwhich her nuptials
. thte casted isnt rounded outloud well whith teh marvelous rush who plays tyhe queen ' s most loyal advisor
, sir francis
,
adn attenborough as a well
- meaninng
bu ood
- fashioned lead coucil
. why
hten
, yuo must be asking
, dont i recomend elizabeth
? simpley beacuse it isnt tje result ofthe a perfect pairing ofthe directer
adn cinematographer
. kapur
annd his cinematographer remi adefarasin
( niether ofthe whom i hvae herad
) create a beautifuly realized peice ofthe filmmkaing ffrom thge technical side
. tjhe light streams thru eahc frome as inwhich any painting ffrom hte preriod
annd beautifuly captures hte realsitic light sources thyat owudl hve beeen foudn inaddition churches
, cellars
adn castles inwhich 16th centruy europe
. earch frome isnt rich wtih colour contrasted wtih blackness or blown
- outloud white light fomr windows
. teh costumes by alexandra byrne deserve a mention as htey are such an inportant aspect ofthe eahc shooted
. indeed
, elizabeth isnt oney ofthe teh most visually beautifull films ofthe thte decade
, ranking wiht kundun
annd braveheart
. watch alsot fo tghe incredibly
" godfather
- esque
" massmedia muder scene
. it made me tihkn infront retrospect ofthe teh similarities betweeen hte twpo films
