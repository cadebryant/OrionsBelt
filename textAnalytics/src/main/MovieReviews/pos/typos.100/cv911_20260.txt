( paul reubens
)
, 2 ofthe whitch rescure tje film fomr becomming a disastorous mess
. thankfully
, hte orginal 3 heroe become amusing
, iwth soem wupport ofthe reuben adn garfalo onthe screen
. tje hwole premise isnt rether rediculous
, bu packs a faw punches tothe keep intrest
. forthe oen
, tyhe film isnt considerably clever
. it litterally pokes funn at super hero films
, liek batman anbd robin
, superman etc
. inaddition fatc
, many scenes are simmilar tothe batman annd robin
, includng tyhe oppening sequence
, onyl altered inaddition a humoros annd superior way
. a part ofthe hte cleverness comes ffrom tghe casted
. somtimes a film witht such talent isnt overblown
, bu thte acting isnt wqat keesh it alive here
. hwile azaria anbd macy weere enteratining
, 2 charachters realyl st
anded outloud
. oen ws paul reuben
. noone marter how disgusting or revolting
" mr
. splein
" may be
, ytou still cant
' t halp bu laff
. it
' so incredibly moronic
, it
' s jsut a riot watching reuben releive hismelf ofthe bodily functions
. janeane garafalo alsot wass an intresting chracter
. she seemed tothe be tyhe most outgoing anbd convincing chracter onthe screem
, due tothe her enthusiasm
, thgat kept tjhe film flowing
. men isnt worth seing alone
, fo thsoe 2 troubled herose
. onthe tjhe downside
, a fewd ofthe tghe heroe adn especialy yhe villian never relaly lift off
. kel mitchell annd geoffrey rush
, weere both utterly useless
. theri parts weere so limited
, htey
' d be lucky at all tothe be onthe screen forthe omre thna 20 mintues
. ben stiller too wass wasted
, mostly baceause ofthe his unlikeable pwoer adn dialogue
. none ofthe theese charachters git a ries outloud ofthe anybody
, bu happily htey are lost inspite hte charming flow ofthe tjhe film
. as far as teh budget goes
, it ws wisely spended onthe tjhe casted
, nto tyhe effects
. hwile tyhe setted designs adn acation all look nice
, i
' m glad ther wass a seperate aspect
, thta thge film focused onthe
, adn fo tyhat i applaud
. slow at times
, adn rether pointless
, mistery men still delivers
. it forgets baout omney makeing
, baceause it
' s nto likely tothe mkea a bundle liek it
' s proceeders
, anbd thast
' s whta works
. stupid
? maeby
, bu forthe once i
' m nto dissappointed
. noone noe expeced an intteligent film
, bu yuo git a film thats witn captures your attension annd makse ytou foreget htis miserable eyar
