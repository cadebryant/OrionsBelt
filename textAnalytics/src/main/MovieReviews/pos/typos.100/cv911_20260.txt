ususally whn a blockbuster comes outloud
, it ' s loaded withthe effects
, stars
, bad scripts
,
annd plenty ofthe acation
. mistery men may contain an all
- star casted
,
adn efects
,
bu tje clever scirpt
adn charactors are whta relaly works
, whlch isnt rare tothe see thsi eyar
. tyhe film isnt based apon tyhe comic book serieses
" thte flaming carrot
" by bob burden
, infront wich 3 wanna be super hereos try
adn fight crime
, onyl tothe be outloud done by teh rela hero ofthe champion city
, captian amazing
( greg kinnear
)
. thnigs go a littel haywire
, whn teh sinister casanova frankenstein
( geoffrey rush
) isnt released inot hte city
, where he captures captian amazing
,
adn plans tothe wreak havoc apon champion city
. well
, hte trio deside tothe tkae matters iin theri pwn hands
, by saveing yhe city
,
bu frist htey ened soem assitance
. tihs isnt where tghe film tkaes a turn fo tyhe better
. inthe thte beggining
, htere weere onyl 3 wanna be ehroes
.
" blue raja
( hank azaria
)
,
" mr
. furious
( ben stiller
)
adn
" yhe shoveller
( william h
. macy
)
. sure tehy weere enterataining
,
bu thier acts growed ood fast
. thyat isnt nutil tehy aquire
" inviisble boy
"
( kel mitchell
)
,
adn
" hte bowler
"
( janeane garafalo
)
adn
" mr
. splein
"
( paul reubens
)
, 2 ofthe whcih rescure yhe film fomr becomming a disastorous mess
. thankfully
, tje orignal 3 hroes become amusing
, wiht soem wupport ofthe reuben
anbd garfalo onthe screen
. teh wohle premise isnt rether rediculous
,
bu packs a fewd punches tothe keep interst
. fo oney
, thte film isnt considerably clever
. it litterally pokes funn at super hero films
, liek batman
adn robin
, superman etc
. iin fatc
, many scenes are simular tothe batman
adn robin
, inlcuding teh oppening sequence
, onyl altered infront a humoous
anbd superior way
. a part ofthe tyhe cleverness comes fomr tyhe casted
. somtimes a film wih such talent isnt overblown
,
bu thge acting isnt whta keesh it alive here
. hwile azaria
adn macy weere enteratining
, 2 charachters relaly standed outloud
. oen wass paul reuben
. noone marter how disgusting or revolting
" mr
. splein
" may be
, yuo still cin ' t halp
bu laff
. it ' so incredibly moronic
, it ' s jsut a riot watching reuben releive himselv ofthe bodily functions
. janeane garafalo alsot ws an intresting charcter
. she seemed tothe be tghe most outgoing
adn convincing charachter onthe screem
, due tothe her enthusiasm
, thast kept tyhe film flowing
. men isnt worth seing alone
, forthe thsoe 2 troubled heoes
. onthe hte downside
, a faw ofthe teh ehroes
adn expecially thte villin never realyl lift off
. kel mitchell
annd geoffrey rush
, weere both utterly useless
. theri parts weere so limited
, tehy ' d be lucky at all tothe be onthe screen fo omre tahn 20 mintues
. ben stiller too ws wasted
, mostly beccause ofthe his unlikeable pwoer
annd dialogue
. none ofthe theese charachters git a ries outloud ofthe anybody
,
bu happily tehy are lost infact tje charming flow ofthe tyhe film
. as far as tghe budget goes
, it wass wisely spended onthe tjhe casted
, nto yhe effects
. hwile yhe setted designs
anbd acation all look nice
, i ' m glad htere ws a seperate aspect
, thgat teh film focused onthe
,
adn fo tyhat i applaud
. slow at times
,
anbd rether pointless
, mistery men still delivers
. it forgets baout monye makeing
, beacuse it ' s nto likely tothe amke a bundle liuke it ' s proceeders
,
adn tyhat ' s waht works
. stupid
? maeby
,
bu fo once i ' m nto disapointed
. noone noe expeced an intteligent film
,
bu ytou git a film thats witn captures your attension
adn mkaes yuo foreget tihs miserable eyar
