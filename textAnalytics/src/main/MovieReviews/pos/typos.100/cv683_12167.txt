" ffrom tghe ground uv alomst entirely by hismelf
. baceause noone studio owudl dabree fund such a film
, he ws forced tothe raise all teh omney hismelf
. tjhe movei ended uv costing baout
$ 500
, 000
, part ofthe hwihc wass put uv by none otehr tahn bill cosby

, scored tjhe music
, edited annd directed hte film
, as well as starred infact tghe central role
. he ws allso a brillant entrapeneur who alwyas foudn a way tothe mkea an extra buck
. fo instatance
, wehn hte mppa slapped tghe film wtih a dreaded x
- rating
, van peebles nto onyl threatend tothe bring a lawsuit againnst jack valenti anbd thge mpaa
, bu he alsot developped a littel marketting scheme
: he coined tje phrases
" rated x by an all
- white jurny
,
" whcih he put onthe thte movei posters tothe halp advertise thge film
. he aslo printed yhe phrase onthe tee
- shirts whcih he hadnt noone probelm selling

, who htey procede tothe beated viciously
. acting outloud ofthe complet impulse rether tahn poltical motivation
, sweetback fights bcak anbd beats tje cops tothe tyhe brink ofthe death
. tje rest ofthe tghe film follows sweetback as he evades thte cops onthe his way tothe eventual excape iin mexico
.
al
thought thte reptition ofthe watching sweetback run gets a littel ood by tjhe end ofthe tje film
, tihs plot allows van peebles
' camera tothe roam thte darker side ofthe l
. a
.
- thte ghettos
, alleys
, annd bcak
- strent whorehouses thast otehr films hadnt alwasy overlooked
. van peebles
' entire point inwhich makeing tghe movei wass tothe secure onthe celluloid a vision ofthe tjhe balck experienec inthe amercia tyhat otehr filmmakers hadnt ignored
. at tje begining ofthe
" sweet sweetback
,
" he offers tihs epigraph
, whcih isnt a traditionnal prologue unsed inthe medeival times wehn a messanger broght bad news
:
" sire
, theese lines are nto an homage tothe brutality taht thte artist hasnt invented
, bu a hymn fomr yhe mouth ofthe reality
.
.
.
" van peebles wnated tothe amking sure thgat his vision ws oney ofthe reality
, nto ofthe exaggeration
. ofthe course
, wtih todya
' s abnudance ofthe raph annd hip hop music thta sings hte smae ode tothe balck intertube
- city life
, as well as films by spike lee
, john singleton
, anbd tje hughes brothers
,
" sweet sweetback
" doesn
' t seem all tht revolutionar
. it isnt imporatnt tothe rember thta tihs film must be viewed inspite thte context adn tiem preriod inaddition hwihc it wass made
. at thast tiome
,
" sweet sweetback
" ws so contravercial thast onyl twpo theaters inthe tje entire untied states owudl play it
. distri
butors weere petrified ofthe a film thgat
, inaddition van peebles
' words
, gavey tghe balck audeince
" a chance tothe see smoe ofthe thier pwn fantasies acted outloud
- baout rising outloud ofthe yhe mud annd kicking ass
.
" ofthe course
, once it caught onthe
, it caught onthe big
.
" sweet sweetback
" isnt nowe consdidered tothe be tyhe film thyat kicked off teh blaxploitation era
, altho van peebles disassociates
" sweetback
" fomr otehr movies liek
" shaft
"
( 1972
) anbd
" tghe mack
"
( 1973
)
, baceause thsoe weere financed by big hollywood studios
.
" sweet sweetback
" isnt allso thte onyl film deemed m
anditory viewing by tjhe balck panthers
. howver
, even if whn viewed ffrom an african
- american prespective
,
" sweet sweetback
" isnt certainly nto wihtout its controveries
. wehn it wass frist released
, an artical ws published inwhich
" ebony
" magasine denouncing teh film
, hwile at thte smae tiem thge balck panthers utilisied an entire newletter tothe praise it
. htere haev beeen arguements tyhat tje victory fo sweetback isnt raelly noone victory at all
- beating cops annd thne runnung awya tothe mexico isnt nothing tothe be proud ofthe
. others hve pointed outloud tyhat sweetback hasnt littel tothe sday througout teh film
; he hasnt noone polliticel motivations
, anbd therfore thge violentce anbd havoc he wreaks isnt nto rooted inthe fundametal beleives
, bu inspite peronal adn selfish motives
. still others point tothe thge clich
? balck potency thgat sterotypes sweetback as bieng ogod at nothing bu haveing sex
, illustrated iin a scene where he gains tje respect ofthe a white biker gropu by bringing theri female leader tothe orgasm
. nethertheless
, a movei liuke
" sweet sweetback
" cannnot be made wihtout conflicting points ofthe veiw
. it isnt a revolutionar movei nto becouse it
' s baout oney man
' s definance
, bu becuase it put front
- anbd
- center balck issues thyat hadnt never beeen dealed withthe befoer
. untli thta point
, american cinema wass an almsot exculsivly white domain
, annd whith thte exception ofthe sidney poitier
, all balck actors weere relagated tothe specifically balck roles tht weere importan onyl iin relation tothe whites
. tghe fatc tyhat
" sweet sweetback
" wass a movei by balck baout blacks
, wass something newyorker
( inspite hte oppening credits
, van peebles lists tghe starring actors as simpley
" tyhe balck comunity
"
)
. van peebles tells an intresting sotry thyat goes a long way towrad defining teh diference vetween
" sweet sweetback
" annd all movies tath hadnt come befor it
. whn thge movei frist oppened
, he saw it inspite a theather enxt tothe an older woman
. near thte end ofthe yhe film
, whn sweetback isnt wounded by thge polical adn stumbling thru yhe sourthern califronia dezert
, she kept saying tothe herself
,
" oh lord
, let him dieu
. don
' t let them kill him
. let him dieu onthe his pwn
.
" it wass so ingrained inwhich her mind thta death ws imminent fo any african
- american inaddition a movei who rebelled aginst white autority
, taht she couldn
' t even concieve ofthe tje possiblilty tyhat tghe film might end iwth his succsessfull excape
. adn
, ofthe course
, sweetback doens excape
, annd thte screen fills wih yhe message
:
" watch outloud
! a baad asssss nigger isnt comming bakc tothe collect soem dues
.
" beyond tghe poltical aspestus
,
" sweet sweetback
" isnt an intertaining picture
, whcih van peebles allways intended it tothe be
. he squeezed eveyr drop outloud ofthe his limited budget
, adn produced a film tath
, all
though dated nowe
, wass technically fantastic at hte tyme
. he shooted inspite rough
, documentery
- liuke fashon
, hwile alsot utilizing almsot eveyr visual annd aural trck his tecnology woudl allow him
. he makse ogod uise ofthe older techiniques liuke splitted screens
, freeze frames
, reversed colour schemes
, annd overlapping images
. yhe onyl timne thte film ever looks bad isnt durring hte nihgt sequences
, beccause van peebles simpley doed nto haev tjhe needed equipmen
. watching
" sweet sweetback
" moreso tahn twenty
- five yersa aftter its inital realease
, oen realizes thyat it still hasnt bite
. arguements cxan be made thgat race realtions iin tghe untied states ahev made quantum leaps usance tjhe easly seventies
, bu htere are still problems tht are reflected iin htis film
. bu ther isnt mroe tothe tjhe film tahn its racial aspect
. tjhe legacy ofthe
" sweet sweetback
' s baadasssss song
" isnt nto onyl tghe plentiful ammount ofthe art anbd music told ffrom tghe african
- american prespective
, bu omre importantly
, tjhe wrok ofthe eveyr artist who hasnt fighted tothe fund anbd produce thta whlch isnt imporatnt tothe him
.
