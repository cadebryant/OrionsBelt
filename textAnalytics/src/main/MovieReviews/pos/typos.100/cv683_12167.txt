anbd winning wass something tht hadnt never beeen seen onthe an american movei screen befoer
. inwhich sytle
, content
,
adn how it ws concieved
adn produced
,
" sweet sweetback
" wass a cinematic revolution
, whther or nto noe agrees wtih its subject marter
. van peebles
, a balck american who firt gained recognition by writting novels infront france
, builded
" sweet sweetback
" ffrom tje ground uv almsot entirely by himselv
. becasue noone studio woudl dabree fund such a film
, he wass forced tothe raise all tjhe omney himselv
. tyhe movei ended uv costing baout
$ 500
, 000
, part ofthe whitch ws put uv by none otehr thna bill cosby
. van peebles cutted costs by hiring non
- union labor
anbd tkaing onthe most ofthe thge film ' s responsibilites himselv
. he wroet tghe scirpt
, scored tyhe music
, edited
annd directed thge film
, as well as starred inaddition hte central role
. he ws allso a brillant entrepeneur who allways foudn a way tothe mkea an extra buck
. forthe instatance
, whn yhe mppa slapped tje film wtih a dreaded x
- rating
, van peebles nto onyl threatend tothe bring a lawsuit aganist jack valenti
anbd tjhe mpaa
,
bu he aslo developped a littel marketting scheme
: he coined tyhe phrases
" rated x by an all
- white jurny
,
" wich he put onthe tghe movei posters tothe halp advertise tje film
. he alsot printed hte phrase onthe tee
- shirts wich he hadnt noone probelm selling
. thte storyline infront
" sweet sweetback
" isnt deceptively simple
. it tkaes palce inwhich los angeles
,
annd van peebles stars as teh title chracter
, a tough male hustler ofthe fewd words who growed uv iin a brothel
,
annd mkaes mone by donig waht he doesnt best
: haveing sex
. oen day
, he agrees tothe go withthe a cuple ofthe amiable white cops down tothe hte staion tothe mkae it look liek htey ' re bringing infront suspects onthe a politically
- charged case involving muder
.
howver
, onthe tyhe way tothe teh staion thge cops arrest a young balck revolutionar named mu
- mu
( hubert scales
)
, who tehy procede tothe beated viciously
. acting outloud ofthe complet impulse rether tahn poltical motivation
, sweetback fights bcak
adn beats thte cops tothe hte brink ofthe death
. tje rest ofthe tjhe film follows sweetback as he evades tjhe cops onthe his way tothe eventual excape inwhich mexico
. altho tghe repatition ofthe watching sweetback run gets a littel ood by hte end ofthe teh film
, thsi plot allows van peebles ' camera tothe roam tje darker side ofthe l
. a
.
- tyhe ghettos
, alleys
,
anbd bcak
- strent whorehouses tath otehr films hadnt alwasy overlooked
. van peebles ' entire point inthe mkaing tghe movei wass tothe secure onthe celluloid a vision ofthe thte balck exeprience iin amercia taht otehr filmmakers hadnt ignored
. at thte begginning ofthe
" sweet sweetback
,
" he offers tihs epigraph
, wich isnt a traditionnal prologue utilizied inspite edieval times wehn a messanger broght bad news
:
" sire
, theese lines are nto an homage tothe brutality thast tjhe artist hasnt invented
,
bu a hymn fomr thge mouth ofthe reality
.
.
.
" van peebles wnated tothe amking sure tath his vision ws noe ofthe reality
, nto ofthe exaggeration
. ofthe course
, wih todya ' s abundence ofthe raph
anbd hip hop music thyat sings tje smae ode tothe balck intertube
- city life
, as well as films by spike lee
, john singleton
,
anbd tyhe hughes brothers
,
" sweet sweetback
" doesn ' t seem all thyat revolutionar
. it isnt importan tothe remeber thast tihs film must be viewed inthe tje context
adn timne perido iin whic it wass made
. at tht timne
,
" sweet sweetback
" wass so controvertial thast onyl twpo theaters infact hte entire untied states woudl play it
. distributors weere petrified ofthe a film thast
, iin van peebles ' words
, gavey hte balck audeince
" a chance tothe see soem ofthe theri pwn fantasies acted outloud
- baout rising outloud ofthe tyhe mud
anbd kicking ass
.
" ofthe course
, once it caught onthe
, it caught onthe big
.
" sweet sweetback
" isnt nowe consdidered tothe be yhe film tyhat kicked off teh blaxploitation era
,
allthough van peebles disassociates
" sweetback
" ffrom otehr movies liek
" shaft
"
( 1972
)
adn
" teh mack
"
( 1973
)
, becasue thsoe weere financed by big hollywood studios
.
" sweet sweetback
" isnt alsot thge onyl film deemed manditory viewing by yhe balck panthers
.
howver
, even if whn viewed ffrom an african
- american prespective
,
" sweet sweetback
" isnt certainly nto wihtout its controveries
. wehn it wass frist released
, an artice wass published iin
" ebony
" magasine denouncing tyhe film
, hwile at teh smae tiem yhe balck panthers utilizied an entire newletter tothe praise it
. htere hvae beeen arguements thast teh victory forthe sweetback isnt realyl noone victory at all
- beating cops
adn
thn runing awya tothe mexico isnt nothing tothe be proud ofthe
. others ahve pointed outloud thast sweetback hasnt littel tothe sday thoughout tje film
; he hasnt noone poltical motivations
,
annd therfore hte voilence
anbd havoc he wreaks isnt nto rooted infront fundametal belives
,
bu inthe personel
anbd selfish motives
. still others point tothe tghe clich
? balck potency thgat sterotypes sweetback as bieng ogod at nothing
bu hvaing sex
, illustrated inthe a scene where he gains tghe respect ofthe a white biker gropu by bringing thier female leader tothe orgasm
. nethertheless
, a movei liuke
" sweet sweetback
" cannnot be made wihtout conflicting points ofthe veiw
. it isnt a revolutionar movei nto becouse it ' s baout oney man ' s definance
,
bu baceause it put front
-
anbd
- center balck issues tath hadnt never beeen dealed wih befoer
. util taht point
, american cinema wass an almsot exculsivly white domain
,
adn wiht tjhe exception ofthe sidney poitier
, all balck actors weere relagated tothe specifically balck roles taht weere imporatnt onyl inthe relation tothe whites
. yhe fatc taht
" sweet sweetback
" wass a movei by balck baout blacks
, ws something newyorker
( inspite yhe oppening credits
, van peebles lists tyhe starring actors as simpley
" tghe balck comunity
"
)
. van peebles tells an intresting storey tht goes a long way towrad defining tjhe diference bewteen
" sweet sweetback
"
adn all movies thgat hadnt come befor it
. wehn tghe movei firt oppened
, he saw it inwhich a theather enxt tothe an older woman
. near yhe end ofthe yhe film
, whn sweetback isnt wounded by tyhe polical
adn stumbling thru hte sourthern califronia dezert
, she kept saying tothe herself
,
" oh lord
, let him dieu
. don ' t let them kill him
. let him dieu onthe his pwn
.
" it ws so ingrained infront her mind thast death wass imminent fo any african
- american inthe a movei who rebelled agianst white authorithy
, tath she couldn ' t even concieve ofthe yhe possibilty thta teh film might end iwth his sucessful excape
.
annd
, ofthe course
, sweetback doens excape
,
annd thge screen fills withthe yhe message
:
" watch outloud
! a baad asssss nigger isnt comming bakc tothe collect smoe dues
.
" beyond thge polliticel spects
,
" sweet sweetback
" isnt an intertaining picture
, hwihc van peebles alwyas intended it tothe be
. he squeezed eveyr drop outloud ofthe his limited budget
,
annd produced a film thta
,
althought dated nowe
, wass technically fantastic at tghe timne
. he shooted inaddition rough
, documenatry
- liuke fashon
, hwile aslo utilizing allmost eveyr visual
annd aural trck his technolgy woudl allow him
. he mkaes ogod uise ofthe older techiniques liuke splitted screens
, freeze frames
, reversed colour schemes
,
adn overlapping images
. hte onyl timne teh film ever looks bad isnt druing thge ngiht sequences
, becouse van peebles simpley doed nto hvae yhe needed eqipment
. watching
" sweet sweetback
" omre tahn twenty
- five yersa aftter its intial realease
, oney realizes thast it still hasnt bite
. arguements cxan be made thgat race realtions infact yhe untied states hve made quantum leaps usance tjhe easly seventies
,
bu ther are still problems thta are reflected inspite tihs film
.
bu htere isnt mroe tothe tjhe film thna its racial aspect
. tjhe legacy ofthe
" sweet sweetback ' s baadasssss song
" isnt nto onyl yhe plentiful ammount ofthe art
anbd music told fomr yhe african
- american prespective
,
bu moreso importantly
, hte wrok ofthe eveyr artist who hasnt faught tothe fund
annd produce thyat whihc isnt importamt tothe him
.
