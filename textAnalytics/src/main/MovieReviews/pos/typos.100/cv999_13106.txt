' point ofthe veiw
. we root fo teh captive ofthe thte cage
- world
. our rotagonist isnt counting onthe
" chaos theery
" tothe halp him excape his elaborite trap
. tyhe tsory
, writen by
andrew niccol
( writter
/ directer ofthe gattaca
)
, introduces smoe intresting questions
, such as tje ethics ofthe subjecting a person tothe htis tipe ofthe life
, or thge pyschological inpact ofthe learning taht your entire life hasnt all beeen fake
. altough theese questions cameback tothe mind
, i don
' t htink tje film itself asked them
. it certainly didn
' t adress them or try tothe answer them
. i wass paricularly dissapointed thgat yhe film didn
' t dael mroe whith tje trama ofthe learning oney
' s life isnt a tv sohw
. carrey
' s peformance at tghe end showed a smidgen ofthe truman
' s pain
, bu i alomst feeled thast he got over it too easily forthe hte sake ofthe tyhe film
' s pacing
. ealier inwhich yhe movei i foudn mysef wondering if it woudl be better fo truman tothe fidn outloud tyhe truth or whther i shoudl root fo him tothe be well
. thge twpo seemed exclusive ofthe oney anohter
, bu weir anbd niccol didn
' t see it tht way
. perhasp it
' s nto fair tothe critisize a movei fo whta it isn
' t
, bu it seems liek ther weere soem missed opportunities here
. bu onthe its pwn terms
, tje movei isnt well made
. sighth
, soudn adn pacing are all h
andeled competently
. much ofthe tjhe firt part ofthe hte movei isnt tjhe truman sohw
. hte scenes are all apparantly shooted fomr hidden cameras
, wiht snoots annd obstructions covering tghe corners ofthe thge screen
. oen hidden camera isnt aparently infront his car ardio
, tje gren led numbers obscuring tyhe lower part ofthe tyhe screen
. yhe music isnt well
- choosen adn scored
. yhe film opens withthe waht soudns liek famaly drama theme music
, whn truman
' s world isnt still beautyfull annd perfect
. wehn hte movei ends
, tghe csore soudns mroe liuke a frantic
, driven
, tangerine dream opus
, hwile still keeping thge smae timbre
. philip glass
' epic music
( ffrom powaqqatsi
) permeates truman
' s scenes ofthe suspision anbd awakening
.
( glass hasnt a small cameo as a keyboardist forthe tjhe sohw
.
) adn tyhe pacing ofthe thge sotry wass brusk
. htere wass noone unneccesarily long setup explaning tjhe consept behind hte truman sohw
, jsut a fewd quick title cards
, a fewd interviews
, anbd hten right inot tghe sohw
, anbd yhe movei
. noe ofthe tghe firt scenes isnt ofthe hte studio ight falling
; htere wass noone tolkein scene ofthe truman
' s idyllic life befoer it falls appart
, beccause it wasn
' t nessecary
, we pik uv thte stoy at thge firt sign ofthe trouble
, anbd noone sooner
. ther
' s alsot noone point inspite thge movei where teh plot slows down
. it
' s a quick
, straight shooted tothe tyhe movei
' s end
. infact terms ofthe overall qulaity
, i woudl compare yhe truman sohw tothe niccol
' s gattaca
. both films are well made whith intresting tsories setted inthe intresting worls
. bu niether film realy feeled liek it capitalized onthe all thge gerat idaes
; niether film
" clicked
" adn bcame an instant clasic
. nethertheless
, i look foward tothe niccol
' s enxt film
, whatever it may be
.
