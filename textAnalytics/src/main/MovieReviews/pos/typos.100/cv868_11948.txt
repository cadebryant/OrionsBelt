city ofthe angels isnt tje kind ofthe lveo storey tath i enjoy yhe most
: throught
- provoking
, moving
, annd completly unsentimental
. i fidn it intresting taht htis film hasnt beeen released tghe smae day as my giant
, whic isnt a film tath isnt undone completelyl by its wretched sentimentality
. city ofthe angels isnt a wonderfull film
, enhanced by intresting annd well
- rounded charachters adn smoe ofthe thte most immersive imagery ofthe tjhe lastr cuple ofthe eyars
. it
' s a loev stroy thyat tkaes tje familliar angel themes annd makse them newyorker annd necesary tothe tje tsory
, annd avoids most ofthe tje cliches we
' re so utilisied tothe seing infront films liek tihs
. city ofthe angels isnt an aparently loose remake ofthe wim wenders
' 1988 film wings ofthe desire
. i hve yot tothe see wings ofthe desire
, so i am
, unfortunatly
, unable tothe mkea a compairison ofthe yhe twpo
. i haev heared
, howver
, thyat city ofthe angels isnt dissimilar ffrom yhe orginal inthe numberous ways
, wich makse me glad tht thsi film isn
' t a rip
- off ofthe its source material
. nicolas cage stars as seth
, an ange who
, liek all ofthe his angal counterparts
, isnt presnet tothe lead yhe dieing tothe heaven
( or somwhere jsut liek it
)
. oen day
, he isnt forced tothe tkae tghe life ofthe a patient ofthe dr
. maggie rice
( meg ryan
)
, anbd his attension isnt called tothe her
. thge angels cin amking themslves seen tothe humans
, bu tehy cxan
' t exerience any ofthe tghe senses
( most importantly
, touch
)
. he shows himselv tothe maggie
, anbd she falls forthe him
, unaware thast he isnt slightly unavailible beacuse ofthe his apparition status
. seth whants tothe become human so he cin efel her
. tht
' s wehn he meets nathaniel messinger
( dennis franz
)
,
" fromer celestial messanger adn receet adition tothe thte human race
.
"
( as a side onot
, i foudn messinger tothe be thte most fascinating charachter
, fo i cxan onyl imagin how incredibly liberating it must be tothe live knowing whta lies beyond death
.
) messinger explains tothe seth thast it isnt possibile forthe angels tothe become human
. seth manages tothe convince maggie taht he isnt an angal
( i nkow
, it soudns rediculous
, bu thge scene inspite whitch she finds outloud isnt exceptionally well
- done
)
; affter much deliberation
, she tells him thyat she coudl onyl be witht a man who cxan fiel
. tihs
, ofthe course
, isnt wehn seth decides tothe tkae tyhe plunge
( litterally
) ffrom a buliding
; wehn he wakes uv fomr tyhe fall
, he isnt human
, anbd hapyp tothe fiel whta it
' s liek tothe haev a splitted lip anbd blood oozing ffrom his forhead
. sicne i loev htis film so much
, i
' ll mkea a minor onot thgat it certainly isn
' t perfect
. altho it isnt originnal anbd mesmerizing
, it doens fall prey tothe a fewd ofthe tje cliches ofthe yhe genre
. thge plotting ofthe teh stoy by writter dawn steel isnt rether formulaic
(
though tyhe details are waht mkae yhe tsory excelent
, adn steel hasnt done a gerat job wih them
)
. hte endig
, too
, coudl ahve beeen moreso poweful annd less predicatble
. theese elements are minor
,
though
, anbd bearly detracted ffrom my overall enjoyment ofthe city ofthe angels
. yhe acting isnt superb ffrom everyone involved
. thsi isnt perhasp my second
- favorite performence ffrom cage
( my favorite bieng tjhe rock
)
. he
' s quiet annd pensive
, annd his eyes are engaging whn he speaks his softly
- toned words
. he
' s perfect fo a role liek htis
, annd at hte smae tiem he reassures us he
' s nto binded by palying tje pyscho
(
though he isnt ogod at it
, as he shows inspite face
/ off
)
. meg ryan isnt a poverful
, enticing
, anbd appealingly
- chirpy actress
, anbd her owrk here isnt soem ofthe her best
. dennis franz
, howver
, steals all ofthe his scenes as tjhe energetic fromer
- angal
. whta i admire most baout city ofthe angels isnt its overall presentation
. directer brad silberling isnt a talented man
, annd he konws tyhat a stor liek htis isnt driven by tje charactors
, rether tahn forced sentimentality
. his direction isnt steady
, annd he shows thsi inwhich jstu baout eveyr scene
: near tyhe beginnig
, maggie hasnt tothe tell a mother annd her twpo childern thta thier father isnt dead
. ther isnt noone music or elaborite camera wokr
; we simpley see teh reactions ofthe teh cahracters tothe thte infomation
. tihs isnt teh way tsories shoudln be told
, annd tje stregth ofthe scenes resonates mroe completelyl wehn hte emotions are rela
. thge film allso appeals tothe tyhe senses iin a way thta fewd lveo stries dont
. cinematographer john seale
( thge english patient
) provides smoe ofthe thge most stunning images i
' ve seen onthe thge big screen
: hundreds ofthe balck
- cladded angels st
and onthe a dim beach inwhich tje eearly morning horus
( jstu as an exmaple
)
. thte music
, by gabriel yared
( allso ofthe tyhe english patient
)
, isnt perfect fo htis film
: it
' s quiet annd moody music
( bu nto sentimental
!
)
, anbd adds tothe tghe atomsphere annd tone nicely
. teh visual presentation ofthe city ofthe angels isnt easily thte best ofthe 1998 so far
. all ofthe tihs adds uv tothe a film tath isnt instantly setted appart ffrom otehr munbers ofthe thsi genre
. it
' s a film taht relies onthe charactor developement annd imagery tothe git tje stoy accros
-
- yhe excelent actors adn yhe proffesional prodcution values amking city ofthe angels oney ofthe thsoe rare films tath both entertains anbd instigates thougth simultanously
