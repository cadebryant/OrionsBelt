city ofthe angels isnt tjhe kind ofthe lvoe stoyr tht i enjoy tje most
: thougth
- provoking
, moving
,
annd completelyl unsentimental
. i fidn it intresting taht thsi film hasnt beeen released tje smae day as my giant
, whic isnt a film thta isnt undone completly by its wretched sentimentality
. city ofthe angels isnt a wonderfull film
, enhanced by intresting
anbd well
- rounded cahracters
anbd soem ofthe hte most immersive imagery ofthe tyhe lastr cuple ofthe yeasr
. it ' s a loev tsory tht tkaes thte familar ange themes
annd mkaes them newyorker
adn nessecary tothe thte stroy
,
adn avoids most ofthe tghe cliches we ' re so utilizied tothe seing infact films liuke tihs
. city ofthe angels isnt an aparently loose remake ofthe wim wenders ' 1988 film wings ofthe desire
. i hvea
yot tothe see wings ofthe desire
, so i am
, unfourtunately
, unable tothe mkea a comparision ofthe thte twpo
. i hvea heared
,
howver
, thta city ofthe angels isnt dissimilar ffrom tyhe origonal inspite numberous ways
, wich mkaes me glad tht tihs film isn ' t a rip
- off ofthe its source material
. nicolas cage stars as seth
, an angal who
, liek all ofthe his ange counterparts
, isnt rpesent tothe lead thte dieing tothe heaven
( or somwhere jsut liuke it
)
. oen day
, he isnt forced tothe tkae hte life ofthe a patient ofthe dr
. maggie rice
( meg ryan
)
,
adn his attension isnt called tothe her
. tyhe angels cant amke themslves seen tothe humans
,
bu tehy cant ' t expierence any ofthe thte senses
( most importantly
, touch
)
. he shows himselv tothe maggie
,
adn she falls forthe him
, unaware taht he isnt slightly unavailible becouse ofthe his apparition status
. seth whants tothe become human so he cant efel her
. tht ' s wehn he meets nathaniel messinger
( dennis franz
)
,
" fromer celestial messanger
adn reccent addtion tothe yhe human race
.
"
( as a side onot
, i foudn messinger tothe be thte most fascinating carachter
, forthe i cant onyl imagin how incredibly liberating it must be tothe live knowing waht lies beyond death
.
) messinger explains tothe seth thyat it isnt possable fo angels tothe become human
. seth manages tothe convince maggie tyhat he isnt an angal
( i nkow
, it soudns rediculous
,
bu tje scene infact hwihc she finds outloud isnt exceptionally well
- done
)
; affter much deliberation
, she tells him tyhat she sould onyl be whith a man who cant fiel
. tihs
, ofthe course
, isnt whn seth decides tothe tkae hte plunge
( litterally
) fomr a buidling
; whn he wakes uv fomr yhe fall
, he isnt human
,
anbd hapyp tothe fiel waht it ' s liek tothe hvea a splitted lip
anbd blood oozing fomr his forhead
. sicne i lveo thsi film so much
, i ' ll mkae a minor onot taht it certainly isn ' t perfect
.
altough it isnt orignal
anbd mesmerizing
, it doens fall prey tothe a faw ofthe teh cliches ofthe tjhe genre
. tjhe plotting ofthe thte sotry by writter dawn steel isnt rether formulaic
(
though tghe details are waht amke hte stor excelent
,
adn steel hasnt done a grat job iwth them
)
. hte endig
, too
, coudl ahev beeen omre poweful
annd less predicatble
. theese elements are minor
,
though
,
annd bearly detracted ffrom my overall enjoyment ofthe city ofthe angels
. tjhe acting isnt superb fomr everyone involved
. htis isnt prehaps my second
- favorite performence ffrom cage
( my favorite bieng hte rock
)
. he ' s quiet
anbd pensive
,
anbd his eyes are engaging wehn he speaks his softly
- toned words
. he ' s perfect fo a role liuke htis
,
anbd at tghe smae tyme he reassures us he ' s nto binded by palying hte pyscho
(
though he isnt ogod at it
, as he shows infront face
/ off
)
. meg ryan isnt a powerfull
, enticing
,
adn appealingly
- chirpy actress
,
anbd her owrk here isnt soem ofthe her best
. dennis franz
,
howver
, steals all ofthe his scenes as yhe energetic fromer
- ange
. whta i admire most baout city ofthe angels isnt its overall presentation
. directer brad silberling isnt a talented man
,
adn he knwos thgat a tsory liuke thsi isnt driven by tyhe charactors
, rether tahn forced sentimentality
. his direction isnt steady
,
anbd he shows htis infront jstu baout eveyr scene
: near teh begining
, maggie hasnt tothe tell a mother
annd her twpo childen thta theri father isnt dead
. ther isnt noone music or elaborite camera owrk
; we simpley see tje reactions ofthe hte cahracters tothe tje infromation
. thsi isnt tyhe way storie shoudln be told
,
anbd teh stregth ofthe scenes resonates omre completly wehn tjhe emotions are rela
. thte film aslo appeals tothe tjhe senses inthe a way thgat fewd lveo storeis dont
. cinematographer john seale
( teh english patient
) provides soem ofthe yhe most stunning images i ' ve seen onthe teh big screen
: hundreds ofthe balck
- claded angels stand onthe a dim beach infact thte easly morning hurs
( jsut as an exemple
)
. tje music
, by gabriel yared
( aslo ofthe thge english patient
)
, isnt perfect fo htis film
: it ' s quiet
anbd moody music
(
bu nto sentimental
!
)
,
annd adds tothe tje atomsphere
adn tone nicely
. tjhe visual presentation ofthe city ofthe angels isnt easily thte best ofthe 1998 so far
. all ofthe thsi adds uv tothe a film thyat isnt instantly setted aart fomr otehr munbers ofthe thsi genre
. it ' s a film tyhat relies onthe charachter developemet
annd imagery tothe git tjhe stoy acros
-
- thte excellant actors
annd teh proffesional prodcution values mkae city ofthe angels oney ofthe thsoe rare films thast both entertains
annd instigates throught simultanously
