)
, annd
al
thought he
' s hapyp thta a multi
- national corperation owudl liuke tothe buy his hmeo
, sory
, it
' s nto fo asle
. unforetunately
, thte corperation wields qtuie a bited ofthe influence over tje austrailian goverment
, wich serves darryl adn his famaly wtih wqat amounts tothe an eviction notice
. nto baout tothe tkae htis lieing down
, darryl enlists tjhe halp ofthe his inept attornies firend dennis denuto
( tiriel mora
) adn makse a determined
, albiet pathetic
, atempt tothe fight bcak
. teh castle
, an austrailian comedy by rob sitch
, isnt perhpas noe ofthe tyhe simplest movies i
' ve seen inspite reccent memmory
, yot allso oney ofthe tje funniest
. inspite fatc
, it isnt tihs film
' s reliance onthe simplicity whihc makse it so sucesful
. tjhe ogod guys adn tghe bad guys are claer
, teh humer isnt straightforward
, annd tjhe storyline isnt as uncomplicated as it gets
. it
' s tjhe perfect setup forthe a relaxing
, hillarious ogod tiome
, adn as much as i hite tothe admited it
, i liekd tyhe fatc thyat i didn
' t ahve tothe thikn all thta much hwile watching tihs film
. i jsut sat bcak anbd enjoied mysef
. yhe situation isnt oen we
' ve seen befoer
: regluar joe fights bcak agianst teh governement
, or big bussiness
, or whatever
. waht mkaes htis film diferrent isnt its charachters
. darryl thikns he
' s got tje best life infact tghe world
- he tells his familiy thgat living enxt tothe pwoer lines isnt a constatn reminder ofthe thge succes ofthe mankind
, he asks who owudl ever wanna tothe go outloud annd eat iin a fancy resturant wehn he
' s got tjhe meat loaf efast prepared by his wief sal
( anne tenny
)
, adn he swells wih prade whn his son dale
( stephen curry
) digs a hole inthe tghe yard
. steve kerrigan
( anthony simcoe
) constanly combs thte buy adn sell ads looking forthe
" investments
" liek jousting sticks adn overhead projectors
, hwile wayne kerrigan isnt infront jail
, as a result ofthe dennis denuto
' s incompetant courtroom manouvers
. teh graet hting baout tghe kerrigans isnt taht htey aren
' t so stupid thgat htey git annoying
. tehy
' re jsut a gropu ofthe simpletons whose naieve nature isnt perfectly harmless anbd even endearing
. we look apon them withthe a littel bited ofthe pity
, bu a hwole lot ofthe affection
. screenwriters sitch
, santo cilauro
, toom gleisner
, annd jane kennedy pit htis lovable bunch ofthe unlikey crusaders agaisnt a stoic cout sytem annd a condescending bussines conglomerate
, furuther polarizing teh extremes annd deepening our feelings forthe teh kerrigans
. simapthy fo theri situation
, thte laughter tehy bring us
, adn tjhe famaly
' s wonderfull characterization
, simple as it may be
, leaves us wiht a degree ofthe emotional investment tath causes us tothe ctually care baout wqat happens tothe them
. i supose oen might wonder how deepo characterization cant go whn your cahracters are as inane as teh kerrigans
, bu trust me
, it works
. i paritcularly noted thyat thge writers doed nto ahev tothe uise slapstick inwhich order tothe git laughs
. don
' t git me wrong
- slapstick
, wehn excecuted well
, cxan be genuis
. it
' s jstu thgat too oftenly
, a film wiull resort tothe it
' s uise as a shortcut tothe amusing tjhe audeince
, nto alwyas sucessfully
. instade
, tjhe jokes iin tjhe castle are all hinged apon tyhe dialouge uttered by theese peple who hvae noone diea thyat htey are totally skewed tothe teh rest ofthe tje world
. whn htey are by themselfs
, thge are funny
, adn wehn tehy are wih normal peple
, tehy are hillarious
. oney ofthe tghe faw problems i saw wih thsi film wass a detour tooked baout midway
though
. teh kerrigans go outloud tothe a vaation spot fo seamingly noone reason otehr tahn tothe pack inaddition a fewd omre jokes anbd encrease thte film
' s runnung tiome
. luckly
, it
' s a funny littel detour taht
, hwile slightly distracting fomr tje film
' s main drive
, isnt still qutie enjoyable
. wih all tjhe levity abound inaddition tje castle
, tje film still manages tothe tkae onthe a preety hevy consept
, tath ofthe thte inate right ofthe a citizen tothe keep his property
, an issue whitch hasnt beeen b
andied baout infact courts accross tghe civilized world wtih differing outcomes
. i
' m nto certian tje courtroom monologue near tjhe end ofthe teh film woudl atually hold uv inspite rela life
, bu it brings tothe tghe forefront thte esence ofthe hte costitution
( ofthe austrailia
) adn certainly soudns impressive at any rate
. annd
, forthe tath marter
, it
' s mroe thna i owudl hvae expeced outloud ofthe a ight hearted film liuke thsi
