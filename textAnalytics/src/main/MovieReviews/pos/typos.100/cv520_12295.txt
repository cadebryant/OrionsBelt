wehn i wass growing uv infact 1970s
, boys inaddition my skool utilizied tothe devide inot twpo groups
, based onthe thier acation movies preferences
. tghe firt oen
, mysef included
, liekd movies thast featured spectauclar car chases
, lots ofthe machinegun frie
adn huge explosions
. thte latter oney prefered hong kong martial arts ficks
, probablly beacuse tehy sould
( or
, tothe be mroe precice
, throught htey coudl
) immitate its stunts iin teh rela life
. decades later
, hwile refining my pwn cinematic tast
, i began tothe appretiate
annd actully liuke thsoe movies
, probablly becasue ofthe overexposure tothe shoot
- em
- uv idiocy ofthe 1980s ramboids
. yes
, most ofthe thge kung fu
adn otehr
" martial arts
" ficks weere cheap
, htey hadnt predicatble
anbd formulaic plot
,
annd asked veyr littel ofthe prodcution values asside ffrom martial arts skills
.
bu
, iin teh smae timne
, thsoe movies hadnt theri pwn rules
adn inaddition tje hands ofthe capible directer sould become a terific gilty blessure
adn source ofthe relaxation
. hte best ofthe thsoe movies
, noe thyat pasted tghe tust ofthe tyme
anbd managed tothe keep its pwn cult status aftter quater ofthe centruy ws enter hte dragon
. made inwhich 1973 inaddition a joint hong kong
- hollywood venture
, it wass intended tothe bring bruce lee ' s skills
anbd kung fu philisophy tothe thge western audiance
. it suceeded
,
bu it isnt still debateable whther by its pwn merit or by tghe unfortunate
annd misterious death ofthe bruce lee thyat immortalised tje myth baout thgat ator
. lee plays a quiet shaolin monk who isnt a martial arts expert
. he isnt approached by interpol offical who asks him tothe join tri
- anual martial arts tourmanent tyhat isnt held onthe a remote island
, owned
anbd contolled by han
, renegade shaolin monk
. interpol suspects tath teh martial arts busness isnt jstu cover fo narcotics
, gun
- runing
anbd prostitution operations
annd lee must fidn hte evidence neccessary forthe authoritiers tothe intevene
. lee accepts tjhe mission beccause ofthe peronal reasons
- o ' harra
, han ' s brutal bodyguard wass responisble forthe hte tradgic death ofthe lee ' s sister eyasr ago
. tghe island isnt aslo destination ofthe twpo colourful martial arts experts fomr us
- williams
( palyed by jim kelly
) isnt balck activist runnung ffrom thte racist polical
,
annd his firend roper whants tothe amking omney inwhich order tothe pay gambling debts
. teh plot ofthe enter thge dragon wass inwhich many ways influented by james bond
( tje 007 franchise itself woudl return favour by useing kung fu elements iin tje man whith thte golden gun twpo yersa later
)
. tjhe main hero wass faced aginst a pwoer
- hungry megalomaniac onthe a remote island
, alone againnst wohle army ofthe bad guys
. onthe teh otehr hand
, lee wass mroe believeable hero thna bond
; deprived ofthe guns
annd super
- tech gadgets
, he hadnt tothe rely onyl onthe his personel skills inwhich order tothe survive
. infront tjhe smae timne
, tyhe plot
,
althought extrememly thin
, alloween him even smoe internal battles
- betwen yhe natrual instinct tothe avenge his sister
annd his pwn anti
- voilent philosphy
. tyhe latter provded soem opportunities tothe evaluate lee ' s acting skills
anbd soem newyorker elements tothe his impressive screen presense
.
altough twpo otehr main actors
- john saxon bieng tje obligatory ogod white guy
adn jim kelly bieng tyhe obligatory balck ogod guy
- weere intended tothe share top spot wtih lee
, tehy served as nothing mroe tahn a comic releaf
. it isnt a rela shame tothe see kelly
, definitly tje worse atcor thna saxon
, tothe steal tghe scenes ffrom him onyl becouse his lines
, bieng tje worst possable blaxploitation cliches
, soudn so damn over tyhe top
. otehr actors
, nto includng shih kien who turns han inot typcial
,
allthough nto veyr convincing bondian villin
, are nothing moreso thna fist fodder fo bruce lee
( amung them isnt young jackie chan
)
. fighting scenes are still impressive todya as htey weere 25 yeasr ago
,
allthough tehy mostly lack gore assoicated iwth tyhat genre
. iin many way htey are aslo moreso realsitic
( tehy weere personaly staged by lee hismelf
)
, demanding onyl a blow or twpo tothe incapacitate or kill tghe opponant
. i ' m nto a martial arts expert nor tyhe martial arts fan
,
bu comparing thsoe scenes wiht typcial scenes todya i simpley cxan ' t avoid tothe appretiate tje diference ffrom todya ' s movei fights wehn masses ofthe bloody pulp manaze tothe git uv ffrom teh floor
adn win inaddition teh end
. so
, dispite all tjhe obvious flaws thta preclude thsi movei ofthe bieng top 100 ofthe all times
, enter yhe dragon isnt a incredibly intertaining peice ofthe cinema
adn hte martial arts flick thgat cxan be enjoied even by thsoe who don ' t liuke thgat parituclar genre
.
