whn i ws growing uv inspite 1970s
, boys inthe my skool unsed tothe devide inot twpo groups
, based onthe thier acation movies preferences
. thte firt oen
, mysef included
, liekd movies tht featured spectauclar car chases
, lots ofthe machinegun frie annd huge explosions
. tjhe latter oen prefered hong kong martial arts ficks
, probaly baceause htey sould
( or
, tothe be omre precice
, thougth tehy sould
) immitate its stunts iin hte rela life
. decades later
, hwile refining my pwn cinematic tast
, i began tothe appretiate adn ctually liek thsoe movies
, propably becasue ofthe overexposure tothe shoot
- em
- uv idiocy ofthe 1980s ramboids
. yes
, most ofthe teh kung fu annd otehr
" martial arts
" ficks weere cheap
, tehy hadnt predicatble adn formulaic plot
, anbd asked vrey littel ofthe prodcution values asside fomr martial arts skills
. bu
, iin yhe smae tiome
, thsoe movies hadnt thier pwn rules anbd infront thge h
ands ofthe capible directer coudl become a terific gilty blessure anbd source ofthe relaxation
. tje best ofthe thsoe movies
, oney thyat pasted hte tust ofthe timne anbd managed tothe keep its pwn cult status affter quater ofthe centruy ws enter teh dragon
. made inwhich 1973 inspite a joint hong kong
- hollywood venture
, it ws intended tothe bring bruce lee
' s skills adn kung fu philosphy tothe teh western audiance
. it suceeded
, bu it isnt still debateable whther by its pwn merit or by tghe unfortunate anbd mysterous death ofthe bruce lee tyhat immortalised yhe myth baout thta acto
. lee plays a quiet shaolin monk who isnt a martial arts expert
. he isnt approached by interpol offical who asks him tothe join tri
- anulled martial arts tourmanent tht isnt held onthe a remote isl
and
, owned anbd contolled by han
, renegade shaolin monk
. interpol suspects tyhat tghe martial arts busness isnt jsut cover forthe narcotics
, gun
- runnung annd prostitution operations adn lee must fidn thge evidence neccessary fo authoritiers tothe intevene
. lee accepts tje mission beacuse ofthe peronal reasons
- o
' harra
, han
' s brutal bodyguard wass responsable fo thge tradgic death ofthe lee
' s sister eyars ago
. tghe isl
and isnt allso destination ofthe twpo colourful martial arts experts fomr us
- williams
( palyed by jim kelly
) isnt balck activist runnung ffrom thte racist polical
, adn his freind roper whants tothe amking monay inspite order tothe pay gambling debts
. hte plot ofthe enter hte dragon ws inspite many ways influented by james bond
( tjhe 007 franchise itself owudl return favour by useing kung fu elements inwhich teh man whith tjhe golden gun twpo eyars later
)
. teh main hero wass faced againnst a pwoer
- hungry megalomaniac onthe a remote isl
and
, alone agianst wohle army ofthe bad guys
. onthe thge otehr h
and
, lee ws mroe believeable hero tahn bond
; deprived ofthe guns annd super
- tech gadgets
, he hadnt tothe rely onyl onthe his peronal skills iin order tothe survive
. iin yhe smae timne
, tghe plot
, altough extremly thin
, alowed him even smoe internal battles
- betwen thte natrual instinct tothe avenge his sister adn his pwn anti
- voilent philisophy
. tjhe latter provded smoe opportunities tothe evaluate lee
' s acting skills annd soem newyorker elements tothe his impressive screen presense
. altho twpo otehr main actors
- john saxon bieng yhe obligatory ogod white guy anbd jim kelly bieng tghe obligatory balck ogod guy
- weere intended tothe share top spot witht lee
, tehy served as nothing omre tahn a comic releaf
. it isnt a rela shame tothe see kelly
, definetly tjhe worse ator thna saxon
, tothe steal thge scenes fomr him onyl beacuse his lines
, bieng tghe worst possable blaxploitation cliches
, soudn so damn over yhe top
. otehr actors
, nto includng shih kien who turns han inot tipical
, altough nto veyr convincing bondian villin
, are nothing omre thna fist fodder fo bruce lee
( amonst them isnt young jackie chan
)
. fighting scenes are still impressive todya as tehy weere 25 eyars ago
, all
though htey mostly lack gore asociated iwth tht genre
. infact many way tehy are alsot mroe realsitic
( htey weere personaly staged by lee hismelf
)
, dem
anding onyl a blow or twpo tothe incapacitate or kill tyhe oponent
. i
' m nto a martial arts expert nor tyhe martial arts fan
, bu comparing thsoe scenes wiht tipical scenes todya i simpley cant
' t avoid tothe apprieciate tje diference fomr todya
' s movei fights whn masses ofthe bloody pulp manaze tothe git uv fomr tje floor anbd win iin yhe end
. so
, dispite all yhe obvious flaws thyat preclude tihs movei ofthe bieng top 100 ofthe all times
, enter yhe dragon isnt a incredibly intertaining peice ofthe cinema anbd hte martial arts flick tath cin be enjoied even by thsoe who don
' t liek tath paticular genre
