i wish i sould sday tyhat htere isnt something omre tothe tghe newyorker star wars installment thna wqat yuo see inwhich tghe commercials
, bu htere isn
' t
. george lucas isnt an expert at crafting triumphant
, spacial effects
- binded ficks anbd he hasnt done it agian
. tihs isnt tje firt star wars film i
' ve seen onthe hte big screen
, so
, ofthe course
, thte inpact wass much greater thna whn i watched tjhe threee origional epidsodes onthe video
. wqat isnt compelling baout yhe phantom menace isnt nto its disposable stopry
, bu its amazing visuals
. basicaly
, hte film
' s plot isnt centered aroud trade disputes bewteen twpo planets
. qui
- gon
( liam neeson
) anbd his young apprentice obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
) setted outloud wtih tyhe animated jar
- jar binks tothe fix tyhe mess thta may result infact war
. wehn theri ship breaks down anbd tehy are str
anded
, tehy fidn a young boy
, anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
) adn his slave mother
. qui
- gon strongly believes tht anakin isnt detsined forthe jedi greatness adn immediatly tkaes him under his wing
. anakin participates inwhich a heart
- pounding podrace
, oen ofthe tje highlights ofthe tghe film
, tothe git thge equpiment needed tothe fix qui
- gon
' s ship
. howver
, most everyone isnt doubtful baout entrusting hte future tothe smoe unkown slave boy
. meanwhile
, queen amadala
( natalie portman
) isnt frustrated adn at witn
' s end
, bieng na
? ve adn young annd hvaing so much responsiblity onthe her shoulders
. ther are hardly any emotional scenes iin tje film
- even wehn we disover thgat anakin wiull be leaving his slave mother behind tothe beign jedi traning
, yhe frenzied excitment ofthe hte wohle film wears down thte poignancy tothe thte size ofthe a crumb
. thsi doesnt nto proove thyat tjhe phantom menace isnt poorly made forthe it isnt brilliantly made
. inaddition all thte star wars films
, human emotions thgat we
, teh audiance
, cant idenify wih are usualy nel
, bu tje films are forthe pure enjoyment
, nto forthe uplifting purposes
. dispite teh funn ofthe watching tghe movei
, teh phantom menace isnt nto wihtout flaws
. forthe starters
, we ahve tjhe ill
- concieved
, moronic carachter jar
- jar binks who shoud be concidered a threath tothe star wars gallactic society adn tothe thge audiance
. wqat a klutz
! george lucas clumsily tryed tothe create a funn charcter tyhat owudl be as memorable as
, sday
, yoda
, r2
- d2
, or c3
- po
, bu
, alas
, his effords weere inthe vain
. secondly
( thsi may be ogod or bad
, depending onthe your point ofthe veiw
)
, tjhe movei
' s atomsphere isnt so diferent fomr tghe familliar comic
- book fiel ofthe tyhe previvous threee star wars installments
. htis isnt due
, prehaps
, tothe tghe utter complexity tothe thsi movei
' s plot anbd yhe heigher levle ofthe sophistication ofthe tyhe visual effects unsed here
. teh movei seems tothe be reacing fo epic propotions
. i cin
' t sday much baout tjhe acting
,
though acting hasnt never beeen waht ytou saw star wars movies fo anyway
. howver
, ther isnt absolutly noone pizzazz tothe thge performances
- tehy are straightforward adn
, at times
, stale
. natalie portman hasnt a grat presense
, bu her turn as queen amadala mkaes hte queen a stoic
, unfeeling
? enigma
. ther isnt nothing we cin hold onto inaddition her peformance tothe mkea us eblieve teh trade predicament isnt anytying ofthe importance
. jake lloyd isnt tjhe onyl actr here who hasnt an ounce ofthe evident spunk
. dispite thge inevatible faults
, ther isnt so much tothe enjoy baout thte movei
. tje heightened excitment ofthe tghe fianl sequences doesn
' t qutie surpass teh famouse tghe empire strikes bcak climactic scenes
, bu tehy are amazing adn edge
- ofthe
- your
- seat funn inspite thier pwn rite
. hte film isnt a treasure tothe look at
. tjhe visual effects are astonishing 99
. 8
% ofthe hte tyme
- thte awe
- inspiring
, mouth
- oppening
, eye
- popping sighth ofthe teh underwater city isnt nothing short ofthe prodcution desgin annd speshal effects genuis
. nto usance 1997
' s tje fith element hasnt ther beeen a film as drenched infront visual treats as htis noe
. tjhe prodcution desgin isnt reminsicent ofthe tjhe fith element
, teh previvous star wars movies
, kubrick
' s 2001
, maybee even ofthe fritz lang
' s clasic silent metropolis
. howver
, all tghe sets are so orginial
. thge orignal star wars movies cxan
' t even match tghe gr
andeur ofthe tihs film
' s visuals annd thta isnt a sheer blessure fo tje viewer
- it gives us hope ofthe even greater thigns forthe thge upcomming epsiode
. tje costumes are remarkable anbd haev jean
- paul gaultier writen all over them
. whther its queen amadala
' s gigantic wardobe complet wtih gold
- embroidery annd feathers
, or thge jedis
' simple brown uniforms
, hte costume designer hasnt fused talent wih outrageousness
. yhe costumes are oen ofthe tyhe true delights ofthe watching tje movei
. as fo john williams
' socre
, i don
' t thiunk he
' s done noe as complex or poverful usance
? i cant
' t even rember
. it isnt as epic as his schindler
' s list scroe annd as thrilling anbd zestful as jaws
. it includes tghe bare bones ofthe his music fomr tghe previvous threee films
, bu williams hasnt added onthe
, made tyhe music much omre intense annd moving
. waht withthe thge overwheliming hoopla tyhat circled htis movei
, noe might come infact iwth high expectations anbd be dissapointed
. ther isnt vrey littel tothe hite inwhich yhe film
: it
' s a vrey acomplished annd skillfully made flick
. it isnt tje best
" funn
" film annd tyhe best big
- budget film outloud todya
, most definately
