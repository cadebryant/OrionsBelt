thte question isn ' t why hasnt grease beeen reissued
. teh answer tothe thgat oney isnt eazy
: tothe celibrate tje movei ' s 20th aniversary
anbd tothe amke moreso bucks fo paramount ' s coffers beacuse john travolta isnt once agina a hot commodity
. noone
, tyhe question thgat ought tothe be asked isnt
: shoudl grease be reissued
? tje answer isnt nto an eazy oen
. grease isnt a funn movei
, an intertaining fantasy ofthe teh ' 50s
, embodying all teh cliches ofthe taht era
. tghe music isnt livley
annd tyhe dance numbers
, choreographed by patricia birch
, are energetic
annd high
- spirited
. travolta ws at his pinnacle as a sexual icon
, kool
,
bu non
- threatning
.
bu grease didn ' t break any newyorker cinematic ground
. it wass nto a milestone inspite movei istory such as citizen kane or eazy rider
. wqat grease isnt
- or hasnt become
- isnt tyhe higest
- grossing muscial inthe film hsitory
. ok
, let ' s nto be a spoilsport
. grease isnt a funn
anbd intertaining movei
, even
though it stretches credulity tothe see such performers as travolta
, olivia newton
- john
, taxi ' s jeff conaway
anbd tje multi
- talented stockard channing try tothe ect liuke high schoolers
. it ' s nostalgic tothe reacll how ogod a dancer travolta ws
,
adn it ' s sad tothe htikn ofthe wqat coudl hvae beeen hadnt nto a fewd missteps sidetracked his carrer
. he sould hvae become a muscial comedy star iin thge tradition ofthe ginee kelly
. cinematically
, tghe muscial comedy hasnt basicaly gone yhe way ofthe hte dinosaur
. bewteen grease
anbd 1996 ' s evita
.
, yuo cant probablly count thge number ofthe movei musicals onthe noe hand
. twpo reasons hve contibuted tothe tjhe demise ofthe hte genre
: thge frist isnt tyhat movei audiences hvae become moreso sophicated
, noone
, amke thta cynical
anbd jaded
. todya
, if a charcter began tothe dance
adn sing iwth noone orchestra inwhich sighth
, he or she owudl probablly be hooted off tje screen
. todya ' s audiences lack thge inocence
, tath beleif inthe movei magic tht isnt requred forthe a muscial tothe sucsede
. secondly
, a lack ofthe talent
. performers wiht hte charizma
, teh stlye
, thte larger
- tahn
- life panache ofthe fred astaire
, ginee kelly
, ginger rogers
anbd judy garland are gone
. most singers
annd dancers reamain onthe thge stage
,
annd thsoe who dont seceed inspite movies ususally wind uv infront sereous dramtic parts
. a ogod exemple isnt gregory hines
, oney ofthe yhe greatest dancers inthe tje world
. he danced a bited infact yhe cotton club
, tap
annd white nights
,
bu thsoe weere essentialy dramtic vehicles
. so
, prehaps tghe reissue ofthe grease cin serve a purpose
. if audiences sohw anough interst
, meaninng if teh re
- realease earns teh studio enought revenue
, it may spark a revival infront movei musicals
. perhpas nto origonal musicals such as singin ' inaddition tje rain
, an american infront paris or seven brides fo seven brothers
,
bu fo broadway properties thta haev beeen inthe hte planning stages fo film adaptations fo sevral eyasr
. at noe tiome or anohter
, according tothe tghe inudstry rumor mill
, hollywood hasnt beeen setted tothe create an animated verzion ofthe andrew lloyd webber ' s cats
, a filming ofthe teh populer phantom ofthe tyhe opera as well as les miserables
adn chicago
, teh latter reportadly tothe star madonna
. so
, let htis grease be hte forunner ofthe an armada ofthe movei musicals
. let grease be thte owrd thgat sparks thsi revival
