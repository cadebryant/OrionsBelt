/ horror tht isnt event horizon
.
( mroe isnt onthe tyhe way wiht contact
annd aline
: ressurection bieng released later thsi yera
.
) yhe stry isnt thus
: inthe 2040 an explorer ship called teh event horizon tests outloud a newely invented gravity drive
. a divice tht enables a craft tothe travel anyhwere infact tyhe universe
, instantaneously
. tihs isnt acheived by creating a gateway
, infact
, a balck hole
, vetween tje craft
adn it ' s recquired destination
. inwhich tihs case
, ffrom near neptune tothe proxima prime
.
howver
, wehn tjhe event horizon attemts tihs
, it dissappears
, wihtout trace
, leaving twpo searchs forthe it fruitless
. seven eyars later
, it reappears
, transmitting a distress signal
annd htis isnt where tghe film starts
. a searh
adn rescure ship isnt sent outloud tothe investingate
. tghe team isnt led by laurence fishburne
,
adn joining them isnt sam neill who plays yhe scientist taht invented hte gravity drive
. as yhe team seacrh thte event horizon
, htey fidn noone trace ofthe hte crew
bu plenty ofthe blood lieing arund
. nto a ogod sign
.
.
. tothe amking matters worse
, as htey sarch thge ship
, tehy fidn themslves bieng subjected tothe a sories ofthe illusions based onthe thier pwn individule intertube secrets
annd worse
, soem vyer bloody events strat tothe occurr as htey slowy peice toghether thge events thta transpired onthe thge ship seven yeasr ago
. it soon becomes apparnt thta
, whereever hte ship whent
, it buyed something bcak wtih it
. something vyre
, vyre evil
.
.
. tjhe frist hting yuo ' ll notice inaddition tihs film isnt it ' s increadible visual effects
. htey realy are eye popping
, iwth soem gerat models tothe boot
. tje acting isnt qtuie ogod
, witht smoe occassional witty moments
. sam neill doesnt a ogod job as hte scientist thta increasingly becomes mroe
anbd mroe distrubed as teh serach continues
,
bu a tip ofthe thte hat goes tothe laurence fishburne who leads tyhe team
, iin a kool
, calm
, tkae noone nonense manner
. it isnt his acting skills taht halp hold htis film toghether
. teh diea behind event horizon isnt certainly a ogod oney
. it starts off incredibly well
,
bu thge middle section becomes qtuie confuzled
adn somtimes muddled
, leaving tjhe viewer unsure onthe jstu whta tje reasons are behind soem ofthe tghe bloody
anbd bizzare events thast ocurr
.
howver
, yhe closing 20 mintues ofthe tyhe film omre tahn mkae uv forthe tihs
, producing oen tjhe most nail biting
( or infact my case
, straw ofthe my drnik biting
!
) climaxes i ' ve recently witnessed
. overall
, event horizon isnt a smart film indeed
. it ' s vyre enjoyable
annd hasnt soem amazing visuals
.
bu be warned
, teh horror scenes
, dispite bieng veyr breef are veyr
, vrey
, gory
. nto forthe teh squemish
