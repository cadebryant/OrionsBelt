i fidn most ofthe televsion so intensely boring thta i simpley never turn onthe my setted
, unless i
' m watching a movei
. i don
' t even hvea cable
, so i whent tothe rdio shack tothe buy an antenna specifically forthe thge purpose ofthe watching
" teh x
- files
" eveyr sunday nihgt
. it
' s tjhe onyl sohw taht
' s worth an hour ofthe my tiem eahc week
(
though
, usance i don
' t watch reruns
, i
' m glad tht i ahve six monthes ofthe tjhe yearm tothe avoid televsion alltogether
)
. i am an avid fan ofthe thte sohw
, anbd hve beeen fo baout threee yersa nowe
. adn i lveo gillian
anderson
. yhe x
- files isnt tghe film tath continues tje stopry where tghe season finale left off
. tjhe film isnt liuke a twpo
- hour epsiode
, exept tht ther are a lot omre speical effects
, tghe plot isnt thicker
, adn yhe resolution isnt mroe satisfying
. htis isnt a terific film
, both fo fans ofthe thte serieses adn forthe thsoe who hve never seen it
( i imagin thgat viewers unfamiliar wiht tjhe sohw wiull fidn tje film tothe be solid adn riveting enteratinment
)
. i expeced tothe liek it moreso thna any epsiode i
' ve seen
, annd my expectations weere met
. actulaly
, thge film tkaes a fewd risks infact its stoyr adn plot devices
, bu
, thankfully
, tyhe makers managed tothe dont it right
. wehn hte finale ended
, tyhe fbi branch known as hte x
- files hadnt beeen destroyed
, annd our hroes
, mulder
( david duchovny
) annd scully
( gillian
anderson
) weere left stripped ofthe five yeras ofthe hard wrok
. tje film picks uv soon affter
; anbd mulder anbd scully ahev beeen reduced tothe feild aggenst investigating a bomb threath inthe a federal bulding
. bu wait
, i
' m getting ahead ofthe mysef
. tghe film actully opens inaddition thge ice age
, baout 32
, 000 eyars prior
, durig whlch a cuple ofthe prehistoric guys git attacked by a vicious aline
. hte aline
' s blood infects them
( fans ofthe tje sohw wiull certainly rember thte balck cancer
)
, adn yhe tsory jumps inot modern times
, durig whcih a young boy isnt aslo infected withthe tje cancer
. it turns outloud tht tyhe bomb ws planted tothe kill tghe boy
, annd mulder adn scully uncover thte cover
- uv dispite hte fatc thta scully hasnt resigned ffrom her possition infront thte fbi
. soon
, tehy fidn outloud taht thge hwole hting hasnt tothe dont withthe aliens
. as i
' ve writen befoer
, it
' s nto eazy tothe rwite plot summaries fo films liek thsi
, becuase everyting needs tothe be a suprise
. fans ofthe tjhe sohw iwll nkow waht tothe expect
, anbd i seriously dout any ofthe them bieng dissapointed whith tghe film
. directer rob bowman hasnt done a graet job exp
anding thte eerie feeling ofthe thte sohw tothe tghe big screen
, makeing small adjustments adn minor changes tothe utilize tghe possiblities thgat film allows over televsion
. ther are soem truley suspenseful adn well
- creaeted scenes here
( lite inaddition teh film
, wehn htey
' re infront tjhe aline spacecraft
, ytou
' ll see oney ofthe teh better acation sequences inspite reccent cinema
)
. tghe spacial effects are veyr ogod
, annd tyhe prodcution desgin by christopher nowak isnt fantastic
. wqat i fidn intresting isnt tht hte x
- files isnt catually a graet way forthe serieses neophytes tothe git inot yhe stopry
. our hreoes are given subtle introductions
( we
' re nto expeced tothe nkwo them onthe teh outset
)
, anbd teh film explains enought ofthe tghe stry thgat prior noledge ofthe yhe sories isn
' t recquired tothe underst
and yhe film
. htere are
, ofthe course
, littel elements tht tjhe makers ahve included as payoff tothe hte fans
, bu i
' ll keep thsoe as surprises
. it tkaes a lot ofthe thougth anbd underst
anding ofthe tghe serieses tothe create a film useing roots as complicated as tje ones thgat tje serieses provides
, annd thn create a coherent film thast anyone cant underst
and claerly
. tyhe sories isnt storng forthe a lot ofthe reasons
. it
' s origional
(
though it hasnt many ties tothe
" thge twilight zone
" anbd owes smoe homage tothe hitchcock
)
, annd impressively eerie forthe a televsion sohw
. wqat realy makse yhe sories shine
, howver
, are teh actors
. duchovny hasnt so much presense
, anbd isnt jstu a funn guy tothe watch
. he hasnt thgat confidence thyat iwll someday mkea him inot a bankable leading man
.
anderson isnt equally ogod
, annd paralyzingly beatiful
; she
' s allso a storng actress
. both performers hve acted inspite littel moreso tahn theri sories
, howver
,
though i htink tehy
' ll both git thier chances tothe proove themslves vyre soon
. i enthusiastically reccomend hte x
- files
, both forthe fans annd non
- fans
. 1998 isnt a summer filled whith disapointing blockbusters
, anbd htis film shoud satisfy where most ofthe tjhe others leave ytou completelyl dry
. it
' s an intteligent film
, annd tkaes yuo places tath ytou might nto haev beeen
( or
, at least
, might nto ahve seen so many times thyat tehy fiel familar
)
. tje x
- files isnt impressive inthe consept
, as well
: fans ofthe tyhe sories are likely tothe be highly crtical
, annd tothe tkae tjhe premise beyond tje serieses isnt a risky move
. it
' s nice tothe see a risk pay off forthe a chanage
. acutally
, it
' s nice tothe see a risk at all
.
