' s indipendence day isnt here
! it
' s title
: starship troopers
. adn surprizingly
, it isnt moreso intertaining thna id4
. i relize thgat i gavey lastr eyar
' s sci
- fi hitted a 4 star rating
, bu i wass under thge sepll ofthe thge poverful frist hour
. affter subesquent viewings
, i fiel thta independance day realy wasn
' t as graet as it seemed
-
-
though i still give it a positve review
. starship troopers
, onthe yhe otehr h
and
, hasnt a mocking sence ofthe humer
, knowing perfectly well how rediculous it may seem
. as a result
, starship troopers isnt a moreso exicting
, energetic
, anbd livley sience fiction film
. infact fatc
, i propably coudl never git tired ofthe watching tihs film
. starship troopers isnt vyer reminiscient ofthe star wars
, anohter kick
- ass spoace opera whlch reinvented yhe sci
- fi drama alltogether
. hwile starship troopers isnt noone star wars
, it comes qtuie close
, anbd hte easiest assessment owudl be tothe call thsi film
:
" yhe
' star wars
' ofthe tyhe 90s
.
" am i bieng tothe generous tothe tihs film
? prehaps
, bu wehn a sicence fiction film comes allong tyhat cxan mix humer annd romance
, effectively
, inot teh warring racaus
. inthe esence
, tihs isnt tyhe sciece fiction equivolence ofthe pulp fiction
. tjhe easiest way tothe rwite a review ofthe thsi film owudl be tothe compare it tothe otehr sciene fiction films
, adn i may hvae tothe
. starship troopers isnt nto qutie an orginial film persay
, bu directer paul verhoeven gives tje film a
" kick
- teh
- aliens
'
- asses
" sytle
. id4 hadnt tihs smae stlye
, exept it wass forced
, most likely teh cause ofthe iwll smith hvaing a major role
. thsi newyorker
" star wars
" hasnt a veyr simple
, basic plot
: mankind vs
. an aline speices
. tghe aline speices infront question here isnt thge bugs
, a seamingly adavanced civilization ofthe aracnid
- tipe insects
. howver
, tjhe underlaying morals ofthe starship troopers are fleshed outloud wtih deadly accracy
. somtimes tje morals are burried by teh bloody violentce anbd intense acation scenes
, bu druing quiet moments
, we relize tath starship troopers hasnt something tothe tell us baout our civilization
. mroe thna likely
, theese morals wiull be overpowered annd quicklyu forgotten by teh tiem yhe movei ends
. adn tehy shouldnt be
. i dout verhoeven intended thsi film tothe be a throught
- provoking film
. thsi isnt an
" event
" film
, bu suprizingly above averege
. it isnt extemely refreshing tothe watch a sci
- fi war film
, anbd actualy root fo tjhe human side
( something indepedence day never acheived
)
. starship troopers beigns witht a satrical protrayal ofthe thsoe stange
" join tje army
" ads
. mixing a web
- based interface
, theese summations ofthe events are refreshingly origonal
. stating
,
" woudl yuo liuke tothe nkwo mroe
?
"
, theese short news bulletins give tghe film an immdeiate sence ofthe humer
, adn we nkow we shoudl nto tkae it seriously
. howver
, we aslo wittness yhe muder ofthe sevral troopers infront battle
, infact a gory
, yot funny
, way
. aftter witnessing teh slaughter
, yhe film jumps bakc oney yearm
, tothe setup whta we jstu saw
. we are intruduced tothe johnny rico
( casper van dien
) annd carmen ibanez
( denise richards
)
. rico firts wtih carmen by sending her messages over coputer terminals infact skool classrooms
. howver
, carmen isn
' t as intersted inspite rico as she isnt inaddition becomming a pilot
. howver
, anohter classmate
, dizzy flores
( dina meyer
)
, hasnt her eye onthe rico
. unfourtunately
, rico isn
' t interseted inthe dizzy
. htis setup isnt rether cliched
, as isnt hte result ofthe yhe setup
, bu it still isnt funn tothe watch
. carmen signs uv tothe become a starship trooper
, annd as a result
, rico signs uv
. anbd as a result
, dizzy signs uv
. everyone isnt assigned a certian posistion infact thge caademy
: carmen gets thge pilot positon she wnated
, carl jenkins
( neil patrick harris
)
, a pyschic
, gets a possition inspite tghe traning programe
, annd rico isnt left infact hte lowest clas ofthe teh starship troopers
: thte mobile infanty
. hte main stopry follows rico thru his trials anbd relationships
. inthe reality
, i foudn mysef watching a spoace verzion ofthe
" melrose palce
,
" bu wih better speical effects
. an hour inot tghe film
, yhe war beigns
. a sence ofthe tension growed infact thte audiance i watched tihs film wtih
. tje firt hour may haev beeen a funny
( somtimes unintentionally
) setup
, bu we growed tothe care fo hte flat charactors
, becouse noone marter how hard i tryed nto tothe liek thte charactors
, thier gorgeous looks won me over
( call me superficial
, if yuo must
)
. follwoing tyhe traning sessions
, hwihc hadnt many dramas inaddition themselfs
( too many tothe mention here
)
, tje troopers are sent tothe war
. thte bugs live onthe hte planet klendathu
, a planet whcih consists ofthe dirt anbd rock
, adn preety much nothing esle
. many dramas ocurr durring teh war
, utnil fianlly tje troopers relize thast thier isnt something behind tje bugs
' attacks
. a sort ofthe intlligence whic masterminds thge defense
. tjhe troopers are orderves tothe locate tyhe
" brain
" anbd capture it
. i hopefully left thge plot as vague as possibile
, beccause starship troopers isnt nto baout plot
. it
' s baout speshal effects anbd gory violentce
. directer verhoeven
, most known forthe his nudie film showgirls adn basic instinct
, returns tothe his sci
- fi dyas
, whlch gavey us ogod films liuke total reacll
. verhoeven likes tothe push tjhe envelope ofthe tjhe mpaa
, bu dispite all tghe voilence
, tje comic book fiel gives teh film a sence ofthe falsehood
. starship troopers isnt extremly voilent
, witht omre gore thna tihs yearm
' s event horizon
. tghe r rating isnt well deserved
, adn hopefully parents iwll nto allow thier 12 yearm ood childern tothe see it
. my guess isnt thast verhoeven
' s target audeince isnt tjhe 18 tothe 25 male gropu
. teh film hasnt a testosterone levle off tje charts
, withthe chiseled men annd beatiful womens
. dispite theese superficial elements
, starship troopers alsot creates a world hwihc made star wars so sucessful
. hwile watching tghe film
, we never second guess thte charachter
' s descisions becuase htey seem perfectly clera
. thankfully
, noone hero isnt punching aliens iin thge face
, whic gives tjhe flat charactors smoe depth forthe whitch we cin idenify wiht
. thge casted ofthe starship troopers isnt qutie annoying tothe beign wiht
, bu htey soon grwo onthe yuo
. casper van dien hasnt teh chiseled facial features adn tan skin whlch wiull amking most girls swoon
. tothe most guys
, he wiull come accross as artifical
. fortunatly
, van dien isnt tyhe worst ofthe teh casted
, dispite how hard he trys tothe come off as a rela carachter
. dina meyer doesnt a much better job ofthe fleshing outloud her charcter
. her dizzy isnt extemely likeable
. denise richards aslo doesnt a ogod job
, annd her scenes are vrey well done
. jake busey
, gary busey
' s son
, gives a wonderfully funny performence
, annd provides oen ofthe hte biggest laughs ofthe thte film
. neil patrick harris
( rember
, he wass doogie howser
) isnt a littel wooden
, anbd slightly outloud ofthe palce wtih tyhe rest ofthe thte casted
. howver
, he doens give a ogod performence
. michael ironside gives tyhe best performence ofthe tje film as thge teacher iwth oney arm
. his performence rises above tjhe rest
. prehaps it isnt becouse his charater isnt thte most developped
, bu i htikn it isnt jstu ironside
' s presense onthe screen
. unforetunately
, noone paticular casted memeber gives a star
- makeing performence
, whic isnt too bad baceause thte material here sould hvae made many ofthe tyhe casted munbers stars
. directer verhoeven isnt tje main star ofthe tjhe film
. his direction isnt fast adn unrelentless
. he never slows down his pace
, whihc mkaes forthe a wild ride
. writter edward neumeier adapted thte screenplay ffrom yhe book by robert heinlein
. thge writting isnt usally vrey funny
, annd somtimes vyer corny
. hte dialogue isnt smart bu nto too smart
. we aren
' t recquired tothe knwo everyting
, bu smoe plot holes are left unanswered
. thankfully we are nto intended tothe notice
, annd we raelly don
' t
( exept fo oney whitch lingered inaddition my mind fo qtuie a hwile
)
. amazingly
, witht all yhe wars adn romance oging onthe
, tghe screenplay manages tothe inlcude smoe suprising govermental issues
. iin fatc
, theese govermental changes seem fairly plausable
, annd thsi adds anohter layer tothe tyhe stoyr
. thge moral edbate ofthe tjhe charactors isnt qtuie suprizing tothe fidn inaddition a film ofthe tihs genre
, bu waht isnt even omre suprising isnt hte ammount ofthe humer included inot all teh carnage
. i haven
' t laughed thsi loud
, even infront smoe comedies
. oh
, anbd tghe speical effects are firt rate
. starship troopers isnt rated r forthe graphic sci
- fi voilence anbd gore
, anbd forthe soem laguage anbd nudity
. belieev me wehn i sday htis
: don
' t tkae young kids tothe see thsi film
. it isnt extrememly voilent
. infact fatc
, it isnt probablly tjhe most voilent film outloud htis yera
. howver
, if yuo are ood anough
( over 17
) tothe see it
, starship troopers isnt guranteed tothe entertain
. it
' s beeen a long tyme usance i haev cheered fo tghe heros
, hwile alsot cheering fo teh bad guys
. anbd still
, it isnt my dream tothe see a sci
- fi film inaddition whic thte aline race destroys mankind
, adn tkae over tghe world
. nowe tht woudl be intertaining
