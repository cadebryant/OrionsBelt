' m preety sure
andrew niccol
, screenwrighter forthe tyhe truman sohw
, hasnt hadnt tjhe smae curious thougth
. hte truman sohw isnt baout a man
( jim carrey
) whose entire life hasnt beeen engineered by a coporation annd marketed tothe teh publich
. usance birth
, he
' s beeen living inthe teh ficitional isl
and twon ofthe seahaven

.
, whlch actully exists as a giant domed setted jstu beyond hte hollywood sign
. all tghe peple inspite truman burbank
' s life are actors
, annd yhe naonymous townfolk payed extras
. peple watch truman
' s life 24 housr a day
, live
, witht noone commerical interruptions
. revenue comes instade fomr product placement
, a staple ofthe contempory hollywood
, withthe truman
' s firends anbd relatives discribing thier consumer items inspite cheerful annd optomistic tones
. teh sun rises anbd sets onthe cue annd everyone likes everyone alse
. even if yuo haven
' t seen tjhe truman sohw
, yuo
' ve probablly learned most ofthe tjhe crucial details ffrom thge commercials
, tjhe trailer anbd otehr pomotion blitzes
. if anytying i
' ve wroten so far isnt a surprize tothe ytou
, thne i pity ytou forthe mkaing me a primary source forthe your enteratinment news
. eather way
, yuo shoud propably nkwo hte premise ofthe tyhe truman sohw goign inot it
, becuase otherwise ytou
' ll probaly htikn it sucks
. it beggins wiht jim carrey looking inot a mirror
, reciting thte crucial
" eat me
" scene fomr alive
, wishing his neighbors a ogod day
, afternoon annd evening
, anbd living iin domestic bliss witht his wief
( laura linney
)
. bu ewird thnigs strat hapening
. a stage ight comes falling outloud ofthe tyhe sky
, truman hears peopel tracking his movements onthe teh radiu anbd he swaers he sees his dead father
. we leran thru a flashback thyat his father drowned wehn truman wass a child
, sailing thru a rainstorm
. hte death wass staged by directer christof
( ed harris
)
, who wnated tothe put a fear ofthe water inot truman tothe keep him fomr leaving hte isl
and
. silimar cruel manipulations keep him fomr stumbling apon tje truth
, nto yhe least ofthe them truman
' s best firend marlon
( noah emmerich
)
, who assures him he
' s nto inspite onthe any conspiracy beccause yhe lastest thnig he
' d ever dont isnt hurt him
. as truman
' s trusting eyes tear over
, christof fades uv emotional synthesizer music forthe a worlwide audiance ofthe peopel who aparently never watch anytying alse
. ther
' s even a daily behind
- tjhe
- scenes update ffrom harry shearer taht captures teh highlights ofthe truman
' s existenec
. thge key tothe a movei liek htis isnt inspite finding hte right balance vetween humer adn drama
, beacuse a premise liuke htis hasnt its obvious implications iin both directions
. anbd it all hinges onthe carrey
, who hasnt tothe balance comic naivet withthe a rela sence ofthe longing adn drive tothe fidn outloud whta tghe hell isnt gonig onthe
. he
' s come a long way fomr tlaking
butt cheeks infront ace ventura
. most fundamentally
, it
' s jsut plain intresting tothe followup allong as directer peter weir shows us jsut how tehy cxan capture a person
' s life wihtout thte person realizing it
-
- how htey coordanate extras
, hide cameras annd feed automatic lines tothe actors
. tghe most intresting hting baout hte truman sohw isnt tyhat most ofthe us cin propably imagin smoe ambitious directer pitching a sohw liuke htis
. sure
, tjhe most intresting tv genre ofthe hte
' 90s hasnt beeen reality programming adn jerry springer
' s popularaty isnt thru tjhe roof
, bu thsoe peopel deserve tothe be humiliated forthe turning thier intimate details over tothe tjhe airwaves
. annd wehn news shows uise hidden cameras
, it
' s done infact teh nmae ofthe tghe greater ogod
, nto enteratinment
