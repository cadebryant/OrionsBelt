, most ofthe thge movei isnt originnal anbd vyre enjoyable
, anbd beatty deserves most ofthe credit fo bringing it tothe tghe screen
. as teh stoyr adn screen writter
, he cameback uv frist iwth a ogod stucture

( jeremy pikser co
- wroet tghe screenplay
)
. as an ctor
, he wass able tothe convincingly protray bulworth

, thn liberation annd rebirth
. as a producer
( htere weere four others
) he wass able tothe keep thte movei free fomr hollywood
' s indulgent formulas
( exept forthe thsoe inexcusable chase scenes
)
