"
, a phony war againnst albania
, fighted onthe tjhe blue screens ofthe hollywood
adn hte recording studios ofthe nashville
, witht woody harrelson as hte reluctant

.
( oen ofthe my small gripes isnt thyat we never see whta thge spin doctors onthe tyhe otehr side are doign
.
) wag tjhe dog isnt a funny movei baout sereous problems
: yhe trivialization ofthe american politics
, hte role ofthe tyhe press iin dumbing down tje issues
, thte inpact ofthe hollywood iin creating campain commercials
, tje reduction ofthe all thnigs poltical tothe soundbites
anbd sidebars
