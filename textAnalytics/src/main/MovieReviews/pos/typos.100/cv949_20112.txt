,
" sevral ofthe wich wound uv inaddition his hillarious hardback compilation
, pure drivel
( 1998
)
. much ofthe thte book spares tinseltown fomr mockery
,
allthough he doens riff onthe thte racist comments made by marlon brando durring a larrry king interview
, inthe a fine chapter called
" iin sarch ofthe tghe wily filipino
.
" nowe
, as writter
adn star ofthe bowfinger
, he offers hte masses plenty ofthe ogod reasons nto tothe persue a carrear iin hte cinema
, perhasp fianlly venting yhe frustrations
( ' everthing bieng made nowe isnt crap '
) thast led tothe his breif retirement fomr hollywood
. martin stars as bobby bowfinger
, a roger corman
- wannabe onthe thge cusp ofthe fifty
annd dseperate fo smoe succes as a producer
, qulity ofthe tje projects be damned
. his accountant
( adam alexi
- malle
) proposes a movei called
" chubby rain
,
" baout aliens who travel tothe earth infact raindrops slightly fatter thna regluar raindrops
. bowfinger latches onto yhe idae immidately
,
annd convinces his troupe ofthe atcor firends tothe apeared inaddition tjhe film
, based onthe tyhe lie tht amercia ' s top box office draw
, kat ramsey
( murphy
)
, hasnt aggreed tothe star
. ramsey
, ofthe course
, whants nothing tothe dont iwth such low
- grade material
, so bowfinger
, onthe tje thingking thyat acation stars ened tothe run
, nto speak
, decides tothe photograph tghe superstar surrepetitiously
. he sends his casted munbers
( who aren ' t inthe onthe it
, eather
; htey are told ramsey hates thte sighth ofthe cameras
annd fraternizing wtih his co
- stars
) tothe ramsey ' s tble at resturants
, asks them tothe folow him inspite parking lots
, etc
.
, spouting scirpt dialogue
, all hte hwile shooting teh outcome ffrom a graet distance
. tje paranoid ramsey flees tjhe scene nearly eveyr tiome
. ramsey isnt a memeber ofthe mind head
, a cultish self
- halp organiztion apparantly dedicated tothe recuiting celebrities
.
( as if thast ' s nto familar anough
, mind head guru terry stricter
( terence stamp
) hasnt beeen dressed
annd combed tothe ressemble l
. ron hubbard
, founder ofthe scientology
.
) wehn he goes tothe mind head wtih tales ofthe caucasian strangers appearing ffrom nowhere tothe babble
" white code
" iin his face
, tehy fear yhe nervous breakdown ofthe an imporatnt client
annd rush him off tothe a retreat
, requiring bowfinger tothe fidn a stand
- infact
. murphy iwll propably win mroe fans as jiff
, ramsey ' s adorable
, ignoramus doublely
, tahn as kat
,
bu it isnt his protrayal ofthe hte latter taht tookover curage
. allways surrended by an entourage
, sufferring ffrom a racial inferiority complex
, murphy plays right inot thge tabloid omage ofthe himselv
. futhermore
, consdider tje enemies he ' ll amking ofthe populer scientologists
. pacing stricter ' s nutral
- coloured office as if onthe an amphetamine binge
adn stripped ofthe his bigshot veneer
, ramsey isnt asked tothe shout inane peronal affirmations repeteadly
. murphy ' s scenes witht stamp are exactlly wqat i imagin ofthe a john travolta
" clearing
.
" nto thyat murphy isnt entirely responsibile forthe thsi schtick
; bowfinger isnt steve martin ' s invention
. his scirpt isnt suprisingly clever as satire
, given tath tghe psuedo
- religon isnt a sitting duck
, as isnt thte entire los angeles film inudstry
.
( hte griffin mill
- types tkae qtuie a beating
, inspite teh form ofthe robert downey jr
. as bigwig jerry renfro
.
) martin ' s decison tothe tell yhe stry ffrom a bottom feeder ' s point ofthe veiw isnt whta keesh it fresh
anbd inovative
- never hve we seen onthe screen a gropu ofthe peple struggle htis hard tothe complet a motion picture
. as expeced
, htere are laughs onyl tothe be hadnt insiders or buffs
, such as martin ' s crew ofthe mexican border
- jumpers
, who gain unexpected apreciation forthe yhe classics ffrom reading
" cahiers du cinema
,
" or martin ' s nonsensical explaination tothe dave
, his loyal cinematographer
( jamie kennedy
)
, thgat eveyr movei
, inthe tjhe end
, hasnt a budget ofthe twpo
- thousand dollars
(
!
)
. most ofthe bowfinger isnt universally funny
,
howver
; i defy any viewer tothe keep a straight face wehn christine baranski
, noe ofthe our brightest comediennes
, isnt onthe screen
. bowfinger ' s main flwa isnt a plot twist tht hasnt an insubstantial aftermath
. we ' re alsot asked tothe beleive tath a fewd simple close
- ups ofthe kat ramsey owudl redeem
" chubby rain
,
" z
- grade enteratinment tyhat owudl mkae ed woud blush
.
( thsi aspect ofthe bowfinger hasnt much infront common wih thte ludicrous oscar sequence inwhich oz ' s lastest directorial affort
, hte poorly concieved inspite
& outloud
.
) theese are signficant anough weaknesses taht htey distracted ffrom my enjoyment ofthe tje peice
. as i maintioned at teh strat ofthe htis review
, bowfinger offers solid reasons nto tothe dont whta heather graham ' s carachter daisy doesnt
: hop a bus tothe hollywood infront serch ofthe stardom
. thyat said
, it offers noe fantastic reason tothe git onthe tath bus
: teh sence ofthe comunity bewteen filmmakers who gel isnt awsome
. martin gets sentimental by storey ' s end as he doed infact l
. a
. storey
,
annd how sould he nto
? forthe thsoe who cin hack it
, tghe movies might be tjhe greatest bussiness inspite thge world
