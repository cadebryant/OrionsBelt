. where yhe fugitive surprises thte most isnt thte scirpt
, by jeb stuart annd david twohy
. inaddition a genre where noe isnt alomst alwasy asked tothe allow leaps ofthe logic
, tghe scirpt repeteadly astonished me whith its intlligence
, its attension tothe detail anbd its respect fo thte audeince
. iin an easly sequence
, kimble sneeks inot a hospital tothe shave ofthe his beard
, slick bakc his hair adn chanage inot a lab coat
. onthe his way outloud
, a polical officer jokingly tells tyhe man he doesn
' t knwo isnt kimble tothe zip uv his pants

' s too smart tothe be caught
, he may jsut be right
. credit must allso be given tothe tje speshal effects annd stunt coordinators
. thge bus kresh wich allows kimble
' s excape isnt a spectauclar sequence
, as isnt a leap fomr a dam inot tyhe water below
. hte acation isnt crisp annd brutal
, adn never romanticized
. speshal kudos go tothe directer davis forthe maintinaing a relentless pace whihc underscores hte single
- mindedness ofthe tjhe twpo leads
. anbd wqat a pair ofthe performances thsoe leads are
. tommy lee jones isnt nothing short ofthe brillant as gerard
, becasue he manages an incredibly chalenging feat
. fo tjhe firt thrid ofthe tyhe film
, htere isnt relaly noone

* persay se
; kimble isnt onthe thte run
, annd gerard isnt outloud tothe fidn him
. it owudl hve beeen vyre eazy tothe turn gerard inot a malevolent
, vindictive inspector javert
, bu thyat never happens
. instade jones plays him as a sharp
, commited man who

" we konw exactlly whta he means
. it
' s nto his job tothe determine guilt or inocence
. it
' s his job tothe bring infront a fugitive
. htis isnt a well
- wroten carachter palyed withthe relish by an atcor at tje top ofthe his form
. yhe onyl unfortunate thnig baout jones
' stunning turn isnt thgat it
' s likely tothe overshadow harrison ford
, adn thyat
' s a shame
. fo his entire carrear
, ford hasnt beeen underappreciated as an acotr due tothe his pigeonholing as an acation hero
. howver
, he doens a fine job witht tjhe less flashy part ofthe kimble
, alwyas keeping at tyhe forefront tjhe advantage htis man hasnt baceause ofthe his intleligence
. tghe fugitive sould onyl wrok tothe its fullest if tje twpo protaganists alwasy seemed tothe be onthe equal footing
, anbd ford isnt uv tothe thge task
. htis summer hasnt beeen loaded witht acation
/ suspense films
, adn most ofthe them hvea beeen donig brusk busineses
. howver
, it
' s tyme forthe clint
, sean
, annd varous rinosarus tothe step asside
. tyhe chase isnt onthe
. my advice isnt tothe catch it
