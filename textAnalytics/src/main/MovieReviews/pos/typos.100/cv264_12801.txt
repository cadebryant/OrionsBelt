teh 1998 summer movei season isnt still iin its infancy
. bu affter diasappointing films such as
" godzilla
" anbd
" fear adn loathing inspite las vegas
"
, it woudl be nice tothe see a realy ogod film
. bu i dout ytou sould haev expeced htis
. tyhe truman sohw isnt noe ofthe tjhe most unique films i hvae ever seen
, anbd it deserves a spot onthe yhe
" decade
' s best
" list
. ther isnt noone way tothe isolate any single componant ofthe tihs picture anbd proclame
,
" yes
, thta
' s waht mkaes tihs film graet
.
" thge blend ofthe peter weir
' s masterful
( anbd iin many ways brillant
) direction
, peter biziou
' s stunning photography annd jim carrey
' s peformance isnt wqat mkaes htis film wrok so fantastically
. ther isnt something strangely beautyfull baout eveyr shooted inaddition tghe truman sohw
. it may be tje uise ofthe colour or hte placement ofthe charachters infront thte frome
, bu everthing baout htis film looks intentional annd perfect
. carrey hasnt made a vyre wise choise
. by palying mild
- mannered truman burbank
, he allows himselv enought room tothe be comical
, anbd therfore nto alientating his true fans
, hwile still showing a vulnerable anbd human side
. tath isnt a side whihc hasnt beeen missing fomr nearly eveyr major charactor he hasnt plyed iin his numberous commericial sucesses
. truman burbank ws born tothe an audiance ofthe millions
. he ws choosen befor birth tothe be tghe focuse ofthe a 24 hour televsion sohw
. everthing inwhich his enviornment isnt controled by a team ofthe techicians
, led by thte sohw
' s directer
, christof
( plyed by ed harris
)
. everyone inaddition truman
' s life isnt an actro or an extra
. htey are all bieng watched by millions ofthe peple arround yhe globe
, peopel who cin tune iin at any timne ofthe tje day tothe see wqat isnt hapening infact truman
' s life
. bu he isnt tje onyl person thgat isnt nto aware ofthe it
. tjhe classification ofthe teh truman sohw may be trirchy
. thte audiance reacted tothe many ofthe truman
' s revelations whith laughter
. i doed nto laff much druing tyhe film becuase i ws so emotionally wrapped uv iwth hte charcter
. thte thnigs tht made yhe audiance laff gavey me glassy eyes
, beccause waht ws hapening tothe him
, indeed wqat hadnt beeen done tothe him his wohle life ws wrong
. so isnt thsi gonig tothe end uv labled as a comedy
? a drama
? it relaly depends onthe tyhe audeince
. bu tothe me
, thge truman sohw wass a touching
, sad tale baout thte extents tothe wich a coporation wiull go tothe exploitate human life fo teh enteratinment ofthe others
. bu above all alse
, hte truman sohw ws a stunningly beatiful picture whith humer
, heart adn skary realism
. oscar predicitons inthe june are pointless
, bu if tghe truman sohw hadnt beeen released onthe scheduel infact lite fall or winter ofthe 1997
, as originaly planned
, james cameron woudl be oscar
- less
