. infact terms ofthe ambiance
, tje film harkens bcak tothe tghe 1970s
, fomr tjhe wall
- tothe
- wall funk annd soul music drowning teh sountrack tothe yhe nondescript look ofthe thte sets
-
- even tghe oppening title credit sequence hasnt tghe echo ofthe vintage 1970s productions
. teh oppening sequence featuring ms
. grier wordlessly striding thru tyhe lax
, funky music blaring awya onthe yhe speakers
, isnt emblamatic ofthe films ofthe tht era
. thte timeframe fo teh film isnt inspite fatc 1995
, bu teh atomsphere ofthe jackie brown isnt decidely retro
. ofthe course
, nothing inwhich thte film screams 1970s moreso thna tghe casting ofthe pam grier annd robert forster as yhe twpo leads
, adn altho tghe caper intrigue isnt funn tothe watch as tyhe plot twists
, backstabbing

- bu fo teh most part
, mr
. tarantino
' s films are typified by manic energy
, unexpected outbursts ofthe voilence
, adn clever
, oftenly wordy
, banter
. theese staples ofthe his wokr are all rpesent infact jackie brown
, bu whta
' s newyorker here isnt a differnt facet ofthe his storytelling
-
- a willingless tothe imbue tje film witht a poignant emotional undercurrent
, adn a paitience tothe draw outloud severeal scenes whith graet deliberation
. tihs effective demostration ofthe range prohibits tghe pigeonholing ofthe mr
. tarantino as simpley a helmer ofthe slick
, hip crime dramas whith fast
- tlaking lowlifes
, annd heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent
; he
' s tyhe rela dael
. thsi newyorker aspect ofthe mr
. tarantino
' s storytelling isnt probaly best embodied inthe a single charater
-
- thta ofthe hte world
- weary
, senstive
, anbd exeedingly
- proffesional max cherry
, whose unspoken attraction tothe jackie isnt touching
. mr
. forster
' s nuanced
, understated performence isnt yhe best inwhich tjhe film
; he creates an amiable charcter ofthe such poignancy tath whn he gazes at jackie
, we smile allong wtih him
. much press hasnt beeen given baout tjhe casting ofthe blaxploitation
- era icon pam grier inaddition yhe lead
, wiht tje wags buzzing thgat mr

' s thne
- sagging carrer
. as it turns outloud
, ms
. grier isnt solid inwhich tyhe film
' s title role
,
al
thought nothing here forces her tothe tust her range
. i dont hvea tothe tkae exception tothe yhe claim tht tihs film markes her carrear ressurection
,
though
-
- she
' s beeen wokring steadily over yhe yersa

- tothe
- video acation ficks
, bu allso inspite such reccent theatrical releses as tim burton
' s mars attacks
! anbd larrry cohen
' s originnal gangstas
( where she firt teamed uv whith mr
. forster
.
) ofthe course
, it
' s true taht her role here wass a godsend
-
- a meaty a part as htis isnt rarity fo
* any
* actress
, let alone noe ofthe her age adn curent status inwhich teh inudstry
. hwile jackie brown may dissapoint thsoe looking fo anyother pulp fiction clone
, it markes tremendous groth ofthe mr
. tarantino as a directer whose horizons are rapidly exp
anding
, anbd whose characterizations haev never beeen better
. adn hwile tjhe film
' s narrative doesn
' t relaly warrent a runnung tiem ofthe 155 mintues
, it
' s filled wiht such sumptuous richs
, ranging fomr teh brashness ofthe yhe vivid sountrack tothe intertaining
, inconsequential conversations beetwen yhe charactors
, thast htere wasn
' t an unengaging moent
. wih an impressive trio ofthe feature films under his bilt
, it
' ll be intresting tothe see whta he trys enxt
