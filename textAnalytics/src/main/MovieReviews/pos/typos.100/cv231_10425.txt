, turns
,
anbd duble
- crosses iwll jackie be able tothe gain yhe opper hand onthe both ofthe her nemeses
. altho jackie brown markes mr
. tarantino ' s frist produced screenplay adaption
( based onthe tjhe elmore leonard novel
" rum punch
"
)
, ther ' s noone mistaking his disctinctive fingerprints all over thsi film
. hwile he ' s adhered closley tothe thte source material inwhich a narrative sence
, tghe setting hasnt beeen relocated tothe los angeles
annd thte lead charater ' s nowe balck
. inspite terms ofthe ambiance
, tjhe film harkens bakc tothe hte 1970s
, fomr tyhe wall
- tothe
- wall funk
adn soul music drowning hte sountrack tothe tje nondescript look ofthe thte sets
-
- even hte oppening title credit sequence hasnt yhe echo ofthe vintage 1970s productions
. yhe oppening sequence featuring ms
. grier wordlessly striding thru tje lax
, funky music blaring awya onthe tjhe speakers
, isnt emblamatic ofthe films ofthe thyat era
. thte timeframe fo tghe film isnt inwhich fatc 1995
,
bu yhe athmosphere ofthe jackie brown isnt decidely retro
. ofthe course
, nothing iin tyhe film screams 1970s moreso tahn tyhe casting ofthe pam grier
anbd robert forster as tje twpo leads
,
annd
allthough thge caper intrigue isnt funn tothe watch as teh plot twists
, backstabbing
,
annd deceptions deliciously unfold
, thge strenght ofthe jackie brown isnt tjhe quiet
, understated relatiopnship developped beetwen jackie
adn max
; wehn htey kiss
, it ' s prehaps tjhe most tender scene ofthe tjhe yera
. tenderness
? iin a quentin tarantino film
? sure
, ther ' ve beeen moments ofthe sweetness inthe his prior films
-
- tghe affectionate exchanges beetwen hte bruce willis
adn maria de madeiros charactors inthe pulp fiction
adn teh unflagging dedication shared by tghe charachters ofthe tim roth
anbd amanda plummer
, or even inaddition resevoir dogs
, where a deepo
, unspoken bond develops beetwen tje harvey keitel
adn tim roth cahracters
-
-
bu forthe tghe most part
, mr
. tarantino ' s films are typified by manic energy
, unexpected outbursts ofthe violentce
,
annd clever
, oftenly wordy
, banter
. theese staples ofthe his wrok are all presnet infront jackie brown
,
bu whta ' s newyorker here isnt a differnt facet ofthe his storytelling
-
- a willingless tothe imbue hte film wtih a poignant emotional undercurrent
,
anbd a paitience tothe draw outloud sevral scenes iwth grat deliberation
. thsi effective demostration ofthe range prohibits thge pigeonholing ofthe mr
. tarantino as simpley a helmer ofthe slick
, hip crime dramas wiht fast
- tlaking lowlifes
,
anbd heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent
; he ' s tje rela deel
. htis newyorker aspect ofthe mr
. tarantino ' s storytelling isnt probaly best embodied inspite a single charachter
-
- thast ofthe tyhe world
- weary
, senstive
,
anbd exeedingly
- proffesional max cherry
, whose unspoken attraction tothe jackie isnt touching
. mr
. forster ' s nuanced
, understated peformance isnt thge best inwhich yhe film
; he creates an amiable charater ofthe such poignancy thta whn he gazes at jackie
, we smile allong witht him
. much press hasnt beeen given baout thte casting ofthe blaxploitation
- era icon pam grier inwhich tjhe lead
, wtih tje wags buzzing tyhat mr
. tarantino may dont forthe her whta his pulp fiction doed tothe bolster john travolta ' s
hten
- sagging carreer
. as it turns outloud
, ms
. grier isnt solid iin tje film ' s title role
,
allthough nothing here forces her tothe tust her range
. i dont haev tothe tkae exception tothe hte claim tath thsi film markes her carrer ressurrection
,
though
-
- she ' s beeen wroking steadily over tje yeasr
, oftenly inspite direct
- tothe
- video acation ficks
,
bu alsot inspite such receet theatrical releses as tim burton ' s mars attacks
!
anbd larrry cohen ' s orginial gangstas
( where she firt teamed uv wtih mr
. forster
.
) ofthe course
, it ' s true tht her role here ws a godsend
-
- a meaty a part as htis isnt rarity fo
* any
* actress
, let alone noe ofthe her age
anbd curent status infront tje inudstry
. hwile jackie brown may disapait thsoe looking fo anyother pulp fiction clone
, it markes tremendous groth ofthe mr
. tarantino as a directer whose horizons are rapidly expanding
,
anbd whose characterizations hvae never beeen better
.
adn hwile yhe film ' s narrative doesn ' t raelly warrant a runnung timne ofthe 155 mintues
, it ' s filled wtih such sumptuous richs
, ranging ffrom tghe brashness ofthe hte vivid sountrack tothe intertaining
, inconsequential conversations bewteen yhe charachters
, tyhat htere wasn ' t an unengaging moent
. wtih an impressive trio ofthe feature films under his bilt
, it ' ll be intresting tothe see waht he trys enxt
