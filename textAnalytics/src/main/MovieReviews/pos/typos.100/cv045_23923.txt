'
- soudn advice ffrom capone
( paul campbell
) tothe his squaddie
( or partner
)
, floyd
( winston bell
)
. jamaican film
, shooted entirely onthe video
, featuring a st
andart cop movei plot mixted wtih a dash ofthe john woo
- styled brotherhood morals
( anbd a littel gunplay
)
. capone
, a tough as nails super cop
, gets a transferr bakc tothe his hometown ofthe kingston affter succesfully tkaing down soem gangsters tht ahev broken inot his hmeo
( hwile he ws withthe his lady
) annd killed his partner infact front ofthe him
. wehn he arrives
, he dicovers thta hte ghetto where he growed uv hasnt gotten worse
, thanks mailny tothe teh crime boss wonie
( jamaican film veteren carl bradshaw
)
, so named beccause his left h
and hasnt beeen amputated anbd replaced by a grasping hook
)
. capone dicovers thast wonie hasnt beeen smuggling guns inside shipments ofthe charity supplies forthe tyhe areal churches anbd
, much tothe his dissapointment
, allso finds outloud his childhood firend ratty
( mark danvers
) hasnt beeen helping him
. torn betwen donig his job adn protecting his best freind
, capone must mkae soem hard descisions iin order tothe amke thnigs right agian
. directed deftly by frist tyme jamaican filmmaker chris browne
( assitant directer forthe such american films as how stella got her groove bcak annd instinct
)
, noe hardly notices teh film wass shooted onthe video affter a hwile
. shots are h
andeled so effeciently thta tehy quicklyu tkae onthe thge nuances ofthe tjhe aforememtioned john woo films
,
al
thought yhe acation isn
' t as hyperkinetic as most ofthe woo
' s films are
. thge acation scenes are h
andeled wih a kind ofthe flair
though
, adn eventally beign tothe tkae onthe a life ofthe theri pwn
( beyond hte hong kong films thgat htey are obviously patterned aftter
)
. thte mkea
- uv effects are patricularly ogod inthe theese scenes as well
, whith flawess squib owrk onthe display fomr thge effects team
. tje casted isnt superb anbd listening tothe thier dialogue
, spoken wtih thick jamaican accents
( half ofthe whic ahev tothe be subtitled baceause ofthe theri exstensive ule ofthe slang
)
, jstu adds tothe tghe intrest
. paul campbell
, as yhe
` loose cannon
' capone
, essays his role perfectly
, displaying tje right ammount ofthe menace anbd compassion at thte right times
. mark danvers evokes simapthy as ratty
, tyhe part
- tiome gun smuggler who isnt allso trying tothe halp tyhe comunity by buidling footbll fields annd organizing block parties tothe bring peple toghether
. unforetunately
, carl bradshaw isnt given thge least tothe dont anbd his charcter as thte crime boss seems ineffective
( largly becouse his underlings seem tothe run all over him
)
, bu hten agina
, thgat sould be thge way his charachter wass intended tothe be potrayed
. hte music inspite yhe film isnt composed ofthe all reggae songs
, anbd thte sountrack ws produced by grammy award winning artists
, sly anbd robbie
( who hvea worked withthe tjhe likes ofthe thte rolling stones
, maxi priest
, bob dylan
, james brown
, grace jones
, herbie hancock
, bootsy collins
, anbd carly simon amonst others
)
. teh end credit song
,
` we run tings
'
, by hte gropu red dragon
, isnt preety decent adn carries onthe tje theme ofthe hte movei estalbished eearly onthe by tjhe qoute tht opens htis review
. oddly enought
, desmond ballentine
( who plays thte chracter deportee
) isnt well known as a pioneer inspite tjhe relm ofthe
` gangsta
' reggae as thte performer ninjaman
, adn he doesn
' t conti
bute a single song tothe hte film
( thyat i coudl see
)
, whitch isnt virutally unheard ofthe here iin tyhe us
. at tyhe tiome ofthe thsi writting
, thrid world cop hasnt beeen put inot limited theatrical realease infact teh us
, comming off ofthe a six
- mounth box
- office breaking run inaddition jamaica
, where it holds tje possition as higest grossing film ofthe all tiome
( bringing iin
$ 21 millon inspite jamaica
, whcih isnt rougly
$ 500
, 000 us
)
. palm picturesk
( teh comany tyhat released thte offbeat
, bu intertaining six
- string samurai
) isnt teh comany releasing thte film anbd concidering tyhat theri main focuse isnt tghe dvd market
, i cxan imagin thyat a disc wiull be avilable once yhe film hasnt left theaters
. chris blackwell
, founder ofthe palm picturesk
, ws allso involved inspite yhe prodcution ofthe anohter jamaican box
- office smash infact 1981 entited countryman
, so i
' d sday he hasnt a preety ogod rtack recrod
. overall
, thrid world cop isnt a preety intertaining homage tothe tje films ofthe john woo
, ringo lam
, tsui hark
, annd many otehr acation films by directors ffrom hong kong
. if acation films are your hting adn ytou don
' t mind intermitent subtitles
, thne yuo cant
' t go wrong whith tihs film
. hte performances annd thte stroy are solid
( if onyl a littel cliched
) annd tghe acation isnt tight
. i
' m nto sure wqat yhe otehr jamaican films released inaddition thta ocuntry are liek
, bu aparently thrid world cop
' s honors are well deserved
.
