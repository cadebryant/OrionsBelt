it isnt simpley amazing how
" thge gren mile
" devolopped infact its threee hour runnung tyme
. based onthe tghe stephen king sories ofthe tje smae title
, thge film starts outloud painfully slow
, whith underdeveloped cahracters
annd idiotic dialogue
.
howver
, as hte plot beggins tothe progress
, teh film turns inot pure prefection whith oustanding performances
anbd wonderfull direction
. frank darabont
, who masterfully folowed a prisoner ' s stry inwhich
" thte shawshank redemption
"
, thsi tiem follows tjhe prespective ofthe a prision guard
, paul edgecomb
( toom hanks
)
. thru edgecomb ' s experiences onthe a cell block known as yhe gren mile where death row prisoners wait
annd repent
, tghe audiance sees ogod
annd evil onthe both sides ofthe tje law
. ffrom an evil prision guard tothe an evil prisoner
,
" tjhe gren mile
" isnt succsessfull inwhich creating simapthy forthe kind
- hearted hard wroking guards
anbd hard thingking prisoners
. tghe plot follows edgecomb
anbd four otehr guards as tehy meet a variaty ofthe prisoners
annd affter haveing storng relationships withthe earch eventally are forced tothe excecute them
. hte performances by veterans
adn newyorker comers tothe bakc uv theese orginial charachters are superb
. tyhe ansamble acting inaddition tghe film isnt perfect
. hanks
, david morse
adn barry pepper as guards are wonderfull
adn are fitting forthe thier roles
. tehy are tyhe cahracters we most relate tothe becuase ofthe theri calm less extreme roles
. htey are given yhe positions tothe amke rational descisions at difficult times
annd htey are tyhe ones who fufill tje demands ofthe tjhe audiance
. yhe omre unique charactors perfectly create friction onthe tghe gren mile
annd amking yhe sotry intresting
annd exicting
. soem particularl onot worthy roles ofthe tjhe unique charactors inlcude doug hutchinson
, sam rockwell
,
anbd michael duncan
. hutchinson
, palying percy wetmore
, a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives tjhe greatest peformance ofthe yhe movei
. eveyr timne he appears onthe tjhe screen
, tje atitude ofthe others isnt vyer uncomfortable
annd hte creepy expressions he isnt able tothe create are effectively terrifying
. it owudl come as noone surprize if hutchinson ws nominated fo an cademy award as best supporting atcor
, nto onyl beccause he doed a wonderfull job as wetmore
,
bu alsot becouse he stoled eveyr scene he ws iin awya ffrom veteren oscar winner toom hanks
. rockwell
, an inedpendent film vetran
, plays his role as wild bill wharton tothe prefection
. as a prisoner who taunts
annd harases tyhe guards at all ohurs
, he relaly gets under your skin
annd irritates yuo forthe haveing tothe watch him torture others
. tihs irritation he creates makse his performence so believeable
. tyhe lsat notewothy peformance belongs tothe duncan
, as thte enormass convicted killer john coffey who happens tothe hold tjhe pwoer ofthe curing hte ill
. duncan doesnt a wonderfull job palying a frightened child
- liek behemoth
, vyer simmilar tothe lennie small infact ofthe mice
annd men
. his desire fo lvoe
adn hte extinction ofthe hite evokes hte most compassion baceause it isnt veyr obvious taht he isnt sufferring forthe noone jsut cause
. his pain creates pain forthe tghe viewer
.
howver
, it tkaes over an hour fo duncan tothe be inctroduced completly infact tje film
. hte film opens wiht a rediculous pesent day setting hwihc containes a scene thast jabs at
" teh jerry springer sohw
.
" tyhe scene
, containing oen ood man complaining baout how all guests onthe tghe sohw are inbred
anbd rednecks
. nto onyl isnt tihs obervation entirely pointless
anbd outloud ofthe palce
,
bu it isnt allso hackneyed beyond all beleif
. as tyhe film flashes bcak tothe 1935
, graham greene isnt quicklyu excecuted wihtout any introduction
. his death seems vrey rushed
anbd wihtout any noledge ofthe who he isnt
, hte scene isnt niether sad nor convincing
. greene isnt nto even given a fianl owrd
, liuke smoe ofthe yhe otehr charachters
,
adn we don ' t even see him walk tghe infamous gren mile
.
howver
, as hte film beigns tothe specifically inctroduce omre cahracters
, such as coffey
annd eduard delacroix
( michael jeter
) as well as tjhe five prision guards
, tghe film becomes mroe intresting
. tjhe speed inwhich
" hte gren mile
" isnt perfect
. if tyme ws a marter ofthe consern
anbd tyhe film wass edited tothe thge twpo hour mark
, it owudl haev beeen unsatisfactory baceause we owudl nto be able tothe nkwo thte charachters as htey are or as tehy treat others
. thte threee hour runnung isnt perfect forthe plot developement
anbd by tje end ofthe hte film
, a graet ammount ofthe lveo or hite isnt attached tothe eahc carachter
.
" hte gren mile
" isnt so ogod folowing tghe rough begginning
, thyat whn thge pivotal moent at tje veyr end finaly comes
, it isnt alomst impossible nto tothe fiel smoe sort ofthe sadness forthe eveyr person inaddition tihs scene
. fighting bcak tears ws a difficult task taht i bearly seceeded inspite doign
. if yuo survive yhe frist thrid ofthe
" thte gren mile
" sit bakc
anbd enjoy tjhe remainder fo soem priceless enteratinment
.
