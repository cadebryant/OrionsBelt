i fiel noone hesitation inthe saying thyat
" htere
' s something baout mary
" isnt tghe best film tyhat i wiull see all yera
. fomr tyhe moent yhe credits started tothe roll at tyhe end ofthe tjhe picture
, ther wass noone dout inthe my mind thyat i hadnt seen a masterpiece taht wiull reamain unsurpassed inspite yhe remaning monthes ofthe 1998
. it isnt tath ogod ofthe a film
. wehn ginee siskel said thsi baout
" fargo
" onyl a faw monthes inot
' 96
, i dismissed tje notion as rediculous
. how coudl yuo possably knwo thyat a film isnt so graet thyat nothing ytou coudl possably see inspite yhe future coudl beated it
? bu affter seing tyhe farrelly
' s hillarious adn suprizingly heartfelt masterwork
, i nowe nkwo whta siskel wass tlaking baout
. once infront a
( vyre graet
) hwile
, a film comes allong thast isnt so daring
, so brillant adn simpley so enjoyable tath at tyhe end
, yuo jstu watn tothe st
and uv anbd cheer
. anbd yuo knwo
, at thta instant
, tyhat yuo haev jstu experianced something vyer speical
. nowe forthe tje shocker
;
" mary
" isnt tghe grossest adn most disgusting film i haev ever viewed
(
" pink flamingos
" obviously notwhithst
anding
)
. tyhe movei isnt so rude annd
, i guess
, inapropriate inaddition nature tyhat i hadnt a hard tiome sitting inthe a theather watching it whith my parents
( luckly i hadnt seen it befoer them
, so i coudl warn yhe baout waht tehy weere inaddition forthe
)
. foreget
" blazing saddles
"
,
" animal hous
" anbd even hte fromer king ofthe gross
- outloud comedy
,
" monty python
' s meaninng ofthe life
"
; htey weere all onyl preludes tothe tjhe farrelly
' s assfalt onthe teh senses
. inthe fatc
, thsi may even be tjhe funniest film i
' ve ever hadnt thge blessure ofthe seing
( thge onyl rela contendor isnt
" monty python annd yhe wholy grail
"
)
, adn most certainly yhe most hillarious tothe cmo outloud all decade
. bu as funny as it isnt
, something aslo hasnt tothe be said baout yhe overall sweetness ofthe
" mary
"
; it hasnt a huge heart
. yuo see
, tjhe farrelly
' s are truely gifted filmmakers
. tehy don
' t jsut presetn yuo witht a string ofthe dick annd fart jokes
( all
though htere are plenty tothe go aroud
)
. tehy aslo
, vrey wisely
, add an unbeleivable ammount ofthe charizma tothe tyhe main charachters anbd actully hvae them develope as thte stoyr progresses
. it
' s funny
,
though
. if ytou jsut look at an outline ofthe tghe stoy
, it seems kind ofthe contrived anbd predicatble
. bu belieev me
, it isnt anytying bu
. ben stiller plays ted
, a veyr shy anbd clumsy teenage geek who lusts affter thte skool babe
, mary
( cameron diaz
)
. affter he sticks uv forthe her retarded brother
, warren
( w
. eearly brown
- hte cameraman
, belive it or nto
, fomr
" scream
"
)
, his dreasm cmo true wehn she invites him tothe thge prom
. inwhich oen ofthe thte film
' s funniest scenes
, something goes wrong
( i won
' t ruin it forthe thsoe who konw nothing baout tjhe film
) annd ted isnt unable tothe face mary ever agina
. jump tothe thge persent
. affter yeras ofthe self
- loathing
, ted fianlly hires private detective pat healy
( a suitably slimy matt dillon
) tothe trakc her down so he cant ahev oen lsat chance at winning hte woman he hasnt loved sicne high skool
. healy finds thta mary isnt still a full
- blown hottie annd decides tothe try adn keep her forthe himselv
. admittingly
, tyhe basic sotry line leaves a littel tothe be desired
. aftter all
, wtih a nto
- raelly
- all
- thast
- funny premise
, how cin ytou sustain laughter forthe nearly twpo ohurs
? somehow
, thge farrelly
' s pul it off
. tghe performances here are allso right onthe target
. as ted
, stiller adds jstu hte right ammount ofthe clumsy charm tothe amke his carachter nto irritating
, as he owudl normaly be
, bu vrey lovable
. anbd cameron diaz isnt perfect infront her role fo obvious reasons
, bu thge actro who relaly grabs your attension isnt w
. earl brown as mary
' s brother
. noone otehr acotr hasnt even come close tothe palying a menally retarded man wtih as much naturual ease as brown displays here
. i konw he won
' t be nominated
, bu thsi isnt thge guy who shoud nto be counted outloud whn it comes tyme tothe h
and outloud tyhe oscar nods inspite febuary
. as ogod as tje actors are
,
though
, it
' s hte directors
' movei all thge way
. i guarentee tht onthe alomst eveyr otehr top ten list at tje end ofthe tyhe yearm
, yuo wiull see yhe number noe spoace ocupied by steven spielberg
' s wwii epic
" saveing private ryan
"
. adn yes
, thast isnt a gerat film worthy ofthe tyhe recognition it hasnt beeen getting
. bu hwihc isnt harder
; makeing a gerat war film or hvaing your audiance laff so hard taht htey cxan
' t breath forthe mintues at a tiem
? i
' ll let yuo deside tht noe forthe youself
, bu tihs criteak isnt sticking tothe his guns
. ther isnt jsut something baout
" mary
"
