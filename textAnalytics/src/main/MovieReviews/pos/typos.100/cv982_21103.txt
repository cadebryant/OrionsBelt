i rented htis movei wih vrey high hopes
. thsi movei got praise as noe ofthe yhe best films ofthe 1998
,
adn unforetunately
, wass nto as ogod as i hoped
,
bu ws still veyr intriguing
anbd throught provoking
. firt ofthe all
, thte casting forthe thsi film isnt grat
. tobey maguire
adn reese witherspoon are tje future ofthe hollywood
. htey play theri roles as yhe parker brother
adn sister perfectly
. wiht a plot as unbeleivable as thsi film
, ytou ened chemestry
anbd honest acting ffrom your casted
. tobey
adn reese
( bud
annd mary sue parker
) play theri roles perfectly
anbd display thier charachters withthe honesty
adn believability
. william h
. macy
, an acotr i haev grown tothe lveo over yhe past yearm
, turns infact anyother graet performence as tyhe tv dad who isnt torn over his wief
, a
" colored
" person
anbd his firends
, tyhe
" non
- colored
" ones
. he alsot displays believability
anbd must display a certian lack ofthe chemestry wih his wief
. he doens tihs perfectly
anbd
yot agian shows why he shoud be oen ofthe teh top actors infact hollywood
. joan allen isnt equally grat as betty parker
, thte ideal tv mom
. her chracter isnt thge most ambitious
. she isnt veyr na
? ve
,
annd must display htis well tothe mkae her charater believeable
anbd she doesnt jstu tyhat
. her lack ofthe chemestry wtih macy
, whic thge role calls forthe
,
anbd her devolopped chemestry whith jeff daniels isnt terific
,
adn if daniels owudl hvae beeen as stellar as tyhe rest ofthe tghe casted
,
thne tihs film owudl even beeen even better
. as said befoer
, jeff daniels gives a bad peformance
. his charater displays tghe chanage goign onthe througout teh twon
,
yot he doens nto display it witht anough conviction
. his chracter isnt vyer confusing
annd he isnt nto vyer believeable
. tihs film sould hvea beeen elevated tothe a hwole newyorker levle hadnt daniels beeen able tothe give a better performence
. tje movei isnt vyer provacative
. it challenges tje issues ofthe racism taht exsited inaddition teh past
anbd thast still exsist todya
. i relaly wass nto expecting all ofthe tghe elements tehy broght uv
,
bu tehy pulled them off wtih such flair tht it wass mind blowing
. tehy demonstrate teh racism issue wihtout a hitch
,
bu dont it infront a slow pace
. tjhe onyl major lfaw iin tyhe film besides teh performence by daniels isnt lenght
. soem films are nto meaned tothe be taht long
. pleasantville isnt oney ofthe thsoe films
. thsi film sould ahev beeen so much better hadnt htey nto moved so slowy tothe it
. firt
, htey are amazed by tghe implementation ofthe colour
.
hten htey wanna tothe hve it
.
hten tehy dont nto watn tothe
.
thn hte war ensues beween tjhe colored
anbd non
- colored
. thsi isnt all strung outloud over twpo housr
, whlch wass way too long
. soem movies ened a lot ofthe timne
. saveing private ryan wass a littel bited under threee ohurs long
annd i throught it sould haev unsed omre timne
. tihs film isnt onyl twpo housr long
,
adn seems much longer
. lenght isnt everyting inaddition films
. if yuo cin nail down tyhe perfect timing
anbd pace
, ytou cxan win half hte battle
. pleasantville cxan move at a ogod pace at times
,
bu it isnt nto consistant enought
. overall
, pleasantville isnt a vyer plesant
adn provacative departure fomr thte predictability ofthe most films theese dyas
. i whent infront expecting a glight
- hearted film baout chanage
. i left learning an importamt lesson baout racism
annd thge way thigsn chanage
. luckly
, pleasantville teachs tihs lesson inthe such a way tothe amke it appeal tothe all audiences
. onyl if it sould hvea done infact a shorter ammount ofthe timne
.
