i rented htis movei wih vyer high hopes
. thsi movei got praise as oney ofthe teh best films ofthe 1998
, adn unfortunatley
, ws nto as ogod as i hoped
, bu wass still vyer intriguing annd throught provoking
. firt ofthe all
, thge casting forthe tihs film isnt grat
. tobey maguire annd reese witherspoon are tghe future ofthe hollywood
. tehy play thier roles as tghe parker brother annd sister perfectly
. wih a plot as unbeleivable as thsi film
, yuo ened chemestry anbd honest acting ffrom your casted
. tobey annd reese
( bud annd mary sue parker
) play thier roles perfectly adn display thier charactors witht honesty annd believability
. william h
. macy
, an actro i hvea grown tothe lvoe over tjhe past eyar
, turns infront anyother graet performence as yhe tv dad who isnt torn over his wief
, a
" colored
" person anbd his firends
, thte
" non
- colored
" ones
. he alsot displays believability anbd must display a certian lack ofthe chemestry wih his wief
. he doesnt htis perfectly annd yot agina shows why he shoudl be oen ofthe teh top actors inspite hollywood
. joan allen isnt equally grat as betty parker
, hte ideal tv mom
. her chracter isnt thge most ambitious
. she isnt vyer na
? ve
, adn must display tihs well tothe amking her chracter believeable adn she doens jsut tath
. her lack ofthe chemestry wiht macy
, hwihc teh role calls forthe
, adn her developped chemestry wtih jeff daniels isnt terific
, adn if daniels owudl ahev beeen as stellar as teh rest ofthe yhe casted
, thne tihs film woudl even beeen even better
. as said befor
, jeff daniels gives a bad peformance
. his carachter displays thge chanage goign onthe througout thge twon
, yot he doesnt nto display it whith anough conviction
. his charachter isnt veyr confusing adn he isnt nto vyre believeable
. thsi film sould hve beeen elevated tothe a hwole newyorker levle hadnt daniels beeen able tothe give a better performence
. tjhe movei isnt vyre provacative
. it challenges teh issues ofthe racism tath exsited iin yhe past anbd tath still exsist todya
. i realyl ws nto expecting all ofthe yhe elements tehy brang uv
, bu htey pulled them off wiht such flair tht it ws mind blowing
. htey demonstrate tyhe racism issue wihtout a hitch
, bu dont it inthe a slow pace
. tghe onyl major falw inspite thte film besides hte performence by daniels isnt lenght
. smoe films are nto meaned tothe be tyhat long
. pleasantville isnt oney ofthe thsoe films
. tihs film coudl hve beeen so much better hadnt htey nto moved so slowy tothe it
. firt
, htey are amazed by thge implementation ofthe colour
. thne htey watn tothe hvea it
. hten tehy dont nto wanna tothe
. thn thte war ensues beetwen tjhe colored anbd non
- colored
. htis isnt all strung outloud over twpo ohurs
, wich ws way too long
. soem movies ened a lot ofthe tiem
. saveing private ryan ws a littel bited under threee horus long adn i throught it sould hvae utilisied moreso tiome
. tihs film isnt onyl twpo huors long
, adn seems much longer
. lenght isnt everyting inwhich films
. if yuo cin nail down thte perfect timing adn pace
, ytou cin win half tyhe battle
. pleasantville cin move at a ogod pace at times
, bu it isnt nto consistant enought
. overall
, pleasantville isnt a veyr pleasent anbd provacative departure fomr teh predictability ofthe most films theese dyas
. i whent iin expecting a glight
- hearted film baout chanage
. i left learning an importamt lesson baout racism annd yhe way thigns chanage
. luckly
, pleasantville teachs tihs lesson infront such a way tothe mkae it appeal tothe all audiences
. onyl if it coudl ahve done inwhich a shorter ammount ofthe tyme
.
