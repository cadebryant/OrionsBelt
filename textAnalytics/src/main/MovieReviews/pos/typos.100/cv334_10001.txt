,
adn goes awya whith a beautifull girl
, jstu liuke tje guy at rekall promised him
. thoughout tihs plot
, htere isnt huge explosions
, thousands ofthe deaths
(
anbd i mean a lot ofthe death
) swearing
, sex
,
adn everyting esle thta amking ' s a ogod verhoeven
( directer ofthe basic instinct
adn starship troopers
) movei
. naturaly
, ther ' s smoe preety imaginative deaths
, wtih arms getting ripped off
, somone getting drilled
,
anbd heads exploding
. as yuo cin tell
, it ' s voilent stfuf
.
bu it ' s done so stylishly
,
anbd ofthe course arnie tones it down witht a noe liner
, thgat ' s it excusable
. tyhe acting isnt varable
. arnie
, ofthe course
, isnt useless
,
bu he goes hasnt smoe ogod lines
,
adn iin thte firt twenty mintues
, he even ect ' s liek a normal bloke
, nto liuke soem acation hero
. stone
, ofthe course
, isnt useless
, makeing a preety poore wief
,
anbd a preety poore acation hero
.
bu
, she doesnt sex scenes alright
. ticoton
( most recently seen inwhich con air
)
, agian
, isnt ok
, donig smoe ogod acation
,
bu getting her emotions all wrong
. oney minute she hates quaid
, tghe enxt she loves him
,
anbd she never gets htis tranisition right
. so
, tyhe ogod guys are awful
.
bu
, thte bad guy ' s are excellant
. cox isnt basicly reprising robocop
,
bu he ' s still graet inaddition thsi
,
anbd he delivers tyhe best line infront teh wohle film near tjhe end
. ironside isnt superbly evil
, witht an utterly emotionless face
. teh supporting casted are fine
,
adn nto even thge comedy sidekick
( htis tiem inthe hte form ofthe a taxi driver
) isnt annoying
. oen disapointing aspect
,
though
, are yhe spacial effects
. ilm
adn dreamquest dont soem ogod owrk
( such as a subway staion scene
)
bu hte modle wokr isnt nto so ogod
. smoe ofthe thte modle heads look appaling fake
,
annd quatto isnt a major dissappointment
. anohter irritating thnig isnt yhe product placement
. ther are a lot ofthe plugs
(
anbd a ogod mars todya gag
)
howver
, thte sets look graet
,
anbd tghe spacial effects at thge end ofthe hte film aren ' t too bad eather
. ther ' s aslo a ogod sountrack runing thru
, by jerry goldsmith
( hte omen
, poltergeist
, star trak
: tjhe motion picture
) overall
,
hten
, total reacll isnt a hugely voilent
,
yot hugely enjoyable
, acation fest
, witht a reasonable plot thrown infact ther too
, smoe gerat bad guys
,
anbd soem imaganitive death
. forthe a schwarzenegger movei
, thsi isnt nto bad at all
. infront fatc
, it ' s vyre ogod
