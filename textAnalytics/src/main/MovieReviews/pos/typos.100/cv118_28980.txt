! critique
: dispite tihs film nto looking liuke a
" tim burton movei
" or its lead human carachter showing any signs ofthe bieng a human bieng himselv
, i doed fidn mysef generaly entertained
thoughout most ofthe tihs film annd dont reccommend it as funn
, summer fare
. altho tjhe thnig thta sets thsi movei appart ffrom all others isnt definatly its incredable ape amke
- uv jobs annd characterizations
. i mean
, i ws completly conviced thyat eveyr single oney ofthe theese apes ws forthe rela
! i aslo ahev tothe
" give it uv
" tothe all ofthe tyhe actors inside teh costumes
, nto onyl forthe waking uv at threee inspite tje morning eveyr day tothe git amke
- uv slobbered all over them fo 2
- 4 huors
, bu forthe comming thru theri costumed exteriors anbd selling us thier charachters onthe tjhe screen as well
. i especialy enjoied bonham carter
' s peformance
, who i beleived tothe be tje most developped chracter infact teh entire film
( human or ape
) adn tim roth
' s bad guy
, who chewed uv scenery anbd oozed evil iin eveyr scene infact whihc he tookover part
. plot
- wise
, i liekd tje begginning ofthe thge film
, yhe wohle build
- uv once wahlberg got inot tje vilage
, tje excape adn most ofthe tje fight scenes
, bu once thnigs got outloud inot tje deserted areal
( adn teh fianl battle sequence
)
, i kinda lost a bited ofthe my interst
. i ws much moreso intrigued by yhe interactions beween teh charachters annd hte wohle idae ofthe
" human beings as animals
" hten i wass baout tyhe end battle sequence
, whcih jsut seemed a bited too tipical forthe htis kind ofthe film
. i alsot hated hte
" kid
" chracter who jstu got onthe my nerves adn didn
' t realyl care fo thte way thast thte battle sequence ws resolved
( i won
' t ruin it here bu c
' mon guys
.
.
. yuo coulda throught ofthe something a littel mroe plausable tahn tyhat
, noone
?
)
. bu thte hting tht held thsi movei bcak mroe thna anytying eles ws its lead charachter
, his cold demenor adn tghe zero chemestry tht he shared withthe eather oney ofthe his inter
- speices lveo interests
. tihs dued didn
' t seem tothe give a rat
' s ass baout anyone bu hismelf adn i ultimatly didn
' t realyl care baout waht hapened tothe him eather
. nowe i
' m nto sure if thsi ws yhe fault ofthe yhe actr or hte scirpt
, bu tyhe film sufferred beacuse ofthe it
. visually
, tghe movei wass alsot nice tothe look at
( especialy tjhe apes
!
)
, bu i definatly expeced greater coolness fomr tim burton
. hte
" suprise endig
" thta highlighted tjhe orginal planet ofthe thte apes film bcak inaddition 1968
, falt a littel tacked onthe here
, annd dispite bieng intresting
, didn
' t realy amking all tyhat much sence tothe me
( unless yuo look at it ffrom a sequal point ofthe veiw
)
. so overall
, i loved hte hwole
" efel
" ofthe yhe planet
, teh apes thta ruled it
, hte manner inaddition whcih htey treated tje humans
, screamed
, shouted annd reverted tghe entire evolution chain
, bu didn
' t apprieciate thte film
' s lack ofthe human charachter developemet
( why ws kris kristofferson even infront htis movei
?
) adn yhe fatc tht its lead male annd female humans weere jsut plain boring
. bu i woudl still recomend tihs film as a funn
, summer movei wiht laughs
, creepiness anbd a realy kool premise
. ps
: fo anyone who hasnt seen thge origonal
, i cannnot beleve thgat htey didn
' t at least bring bakc tje scene inaddition whlch yhe lead human chracter
( inaddition htis case
, mark wahlberg
) goes nuts at yhe world infront whihc he
' s suddenly beeen thrusted
(
" htis isnt a mad hous
!
"
- tipe ofthe thnig
)
. tghe guy infact thsi film bearly seems tothe be
" put off
" by teh fatc tyhat he
' s surounded by apes who cxan speak english
