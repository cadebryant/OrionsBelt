, liek pacing
. hte lsat thrid ofthe tje movei realy doesn
' t wokr as well as i woudl hvae liekd
, annd forthe a rumatic comedy
, it
' s slow
. once hanks knwos thge sceret
, it gets realy slow
. i even looked at my watch a cuple times
, tothe mkae sure ephron ws gogin tothe deliver tghe big onscreen kiss i wass waiting forthe
, so tath i sould git hmeo at a reasonable hour
