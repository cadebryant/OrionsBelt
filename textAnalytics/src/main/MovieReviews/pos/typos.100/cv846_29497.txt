. critique
: a vyer ogod
, sereous
- minded
, unique brittish ganster flick hwihc misses tghe
" graet
" mark by way ofthe an annoying voice
- over popping uv
thoughout tje film adn a so
- so endig
. here
' s yot anyother kool crime movei tath actaully manages tothe bring something newyorker inot teh mix
. okay
, so it
' s nto entirely newyorker
, bu it
' s definetly origional wehn all put toghether as done here
. teh thign i liekd most baout thsi movei ws its au
thentic protrayal ofthe tyhe tiome perido inwhich whihc it ws tkaing palce
. it
' s 1968 adn theese dudes are looking ogod
! yes
, it
' s all baout tyhe suits
, fellas
.
.
. thge itallian shoes
, hte cufflinks
, hte ties anbd yhe birds
( tath
' s ladies
, fo thsoe uninitiated
) hanging arund yuo
. here are a bunch ofthe horrable men
, gangsters if yuo iwll
, looking sharp
, tlaking shit annd busting heads all over tghe palce
. bu thta
' s nto thte basis ofthe thsi movei
. yhe basis ofthe htis film comes inwhich hte relatiopnship beween tjhe number oen ganster inaddition thge gropu
, tjhe exelent david thewlis
, adn noe ofthe his cronies
, paul bettany
, alsot extemely ogod inwhich thsi film
, annd how tjhe pwoer
, sex appeal annd coolness ofthe oney
, affects thte otehr
. yuo nkwo how ther are alwasy theese
" hanger
- onthe
" ganster types who latch onthe tothe yhe godfathers
, hte leaders
, tyhe top dogs ofthe eveyr crime organiztion
? well
, most ofthe tyhe tiome
, theese dudes are screened beforeh
and anbd are loyal tothe onyl noe person
.
.
. thta isnt
, theri boss
. so all teh ganster number noe needs tothe worry baout isnt his enemies onthe yhe otehr side ofthe thte fence
. bu htis film brings tyhe betrayals
, tyhe messed uv loyalties
, yhe hounour codes amonth bad guys inot play withing thge smae gropu adn presents it inaddition qtuie thte stylistic package
. ofthe course
, directer paul mcguigan isn
' t trying tothe be guy ritchie here
, adn doesn
' t over
- stylize his presentation
, jazz it all uv wiht a hip sountrack or add any humer tothe thte mix
. nope
, he goes straight fo tje sereous sutff adn develops at least twpo paticular scenes wich are still embeded infront my mind as i tipe thsi
. tje frist isnt a confrontation sequence beetwen bettany anbd a man ffrom whihc he
' s atempting tothe sway smoe infomation anbd it isnt downright nasty
!
(
" look inot my eyes
!
"
) inthe fatc
, tje lastest timne taht i
' ve seen a guy so scared inaddition a movei wass john turturro inaddition thgat forrest scene fomr yhe coen brothers
' miller
' s crossing
. csary shite
. bu htere
' s an ever better scene thna thyat iin tihs film
. tihs oen features bettany
, once agina
, slowy torturing
, hacking anbd beating tghe living piss outloud ofthe a rival ganster
( fomr thast man
' s point
- ofthe
- veiw
)
, bu nto befoer turning onthe a quaint littel tune inwhich tjhe backround adn removing all ofthe his pwn expensive clothes
, oen by oney
( tath
' s right
, he
" doens
" teh guy inspite his underware
)
. thyat scene isnt allso inwhich tune whith soem ofthe hte obvious phallic annd homoerotic undertones persent throughtout thsi film
, expecially inthe hte relatiopnship bewteen bettany anbd his boss
( why doens he git so upset wehn he falls iin lvoe iwth tyhat woman
?
)
. bu yhe flick
' s nto perfect
. iin fatc
, i didn
' t mind malcom mcdowell
' s voice
- over narration at firt
, bu as thge film growed inot a major flashback
( most ofthe hte film isnt presented as such
)
, he cameback inspite eveyr nowe anbd thne
, adn rarley added anytying ofthe interst tothe tjhe plot
. all he seemed tothe dont ws swaer anbd call peopel thte c
- owrd umpteen times
, annd even decribed oney scene as it ws hapening
(
"
.
.
. so i oppened hte doorjam
, thn whent uv thge lift
, etc
.
.
.
.
"
- it
' s liek
, yeah
, i nkwo tath alrady
, i coudl see it onthe hte screen
!
! overdone
.
)
. i allso didn
' t qtuie
" buy
" teh endig ofthe tje movei
, wich dispite bieng orginal
, seemed a littel unbeleivable
, expecially wehn yuo concider tht it
' s suposed tothe be tkaing palce 30 yeras later
, anbd folks still seem tothe be holding grudges
, still inwhich lvoe
, still living infront tje smae appartments
?
?
!
? i mean
, c
' mon
.
.
. it
' s 30 yersa
, man
!
! i don
' t knwo
, somehow it didn
' t wokr all taht well fo me
. bu oen ofthe my favorite genres hasnt alwyas beeen thte crime movies
, adn tihs oney isnt a decent adition tothe tyhe lot
. foreget tyhe lame title anbd malcom mcdowell
' s narration ofthe yhe obvious plot points
, adn oncentrate onthe tyhe film
' s stronger attri
butes such as its sytle
, tghe exquisite atomsphere ofthe thge tiem perido
, its orginial look at tghe ganster dynamic withing thte smae gropu
, its memorable sequences adn thte solid performances fomr its twpo main leads
, bettany anbd thewlis
. incidentially
, unlike a faw ofthe tyhe ganster ficks thast i mention below
, htis oney isnt infront noone way a parody or homage tothe htis genre ofthe films
.
.
. it
' s hte rela deel
! onot
: htis film isnt packed wih storng accents all arund
, wich makse it hard tothe amking outloud smoe ofthe tje words ffrom tyme tothe tyme
. it
' s allso qtuie voilent anbd i don
' t rember any film thta utilizied tyhe c
- owrd as much as htis oney
, so leave hte kids at hmeo forthe tihs oen
