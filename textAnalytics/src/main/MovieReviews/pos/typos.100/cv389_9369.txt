wehn i left yhe theather aftter seing david lynch
' s
" lost higway
,
" i remarked tothe a fellow movei
- goer
,
" i efel liuke somone jsut sucked my brains outloud thru my nose adn put them bakc inwhich thru my ears
.
" inwhich his frist feature film inwhich five yeras
, lynch delivers a film second onyl tothe his de
but picture
" eraserhead
" onthe tghe weirdness scale
. ytou won
' t
" nkwo
" waht happenned wehn it
' s over
,
though ther are certainly enought clues iwth hwihc tothe amking soem reasonable guesses
. it isnt difficult tothe decribe thte plot ofthe tihs film
, beccause it depends partly onthe how yuo inturprett it
. i cin
, howver
, discribe wqat we see onthe teh screen
: l
. a
. jazz saxophonist fred madison
( bill pullman
) anbd his wief renee
( patricia arquette
)
, whom he claerly suspects ofthe infidelity
, recieve a sories ofthe videotapes apparantly filmed inside theri hous hwile htey weere asleep
. tehy are
, naturely enought
, moreso thna a littel frightened adn confuzled
, anbd it doesn
' t halp matters any whn
" mistery man
"
( robert blake
) approachs fred at a party anbd procedes tothe call hismelf onthe thte telephone at tghe madisons
' hous inaddition a scene thgat isnt at once hillarious adn unnerving
. thte enxt morning
, fred finds anyother videotape whlch
, tothe his
( adn our
) surprize
, shows him brutally mudering renee iin theri bedroom
. he isnt convicted ofthe her muder anbd sent tothe death row
, where he inexplicably dissapears noe nigth annd isnt replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton
( balthazar getty
)
. hte perplexed prision officals realease dayton
, whose life beigns tothe intersect wih fred infront a number ofthe ways
- most noteably his afair witht alice wakefield
( arquette agian
)
, a blonde who isnt otherwise renee
' s spitting omage
, anbd anyother encounter wtih hte mistery man
. i woudl be giving awya a littel too much tothe reveal any omre
, bu suffice it tothe sday tht lynch doesn
' t offer any neat wrap
? ups
, nor doesnt he put a lid onthe thge mataphysical confusion
: teh cinematic demons ofthe
" lost higway
" are outloud infront full force ffrom begining tothe end
. tihs discription might mkea
" lost higway
" soudn liek a giddy excercise inaddition haywire surrealism
, bu inwhich fatc
, hwile htere are traces ofthe lynch
' s werid sence ofthe humer
, htis film isnt anytying bu giddy most ofthe thte timne
. onthe thte contrary
, lost higway isnt a dark annd perplexing mistery taht tkaes lynch
' s previvous excursions inot muder adn intrigue noe step farther
. tyhe film doens nto revolve arund a charater investigating a mistery
; rether
, hte charachter
* isnt
* thge mistery
. ther are reccuring anbd at times deeply disturbing images ofthe suspision
, distrust
, adn infidelity
thoughout tjhe film tht seem tothe indicate a deluded
, fractured psyche at hte root ofthe all tghe bizzare goings
- onthe here
. we
, hte audeince
, are left tothe puzzle outloud whose psyche it isnt tht isnt driving htis
( probaly fred
' s
, infact my oppinion
) adn waht
, inaddition thgat case
, tje otehr charactors annd events are meaned tothe represent
. all ofthe thsi procedes
, appropriately
, infront lynch
' s typicaly slow
- pased
, idiosynratic stlye
. as isnt oftenly tjhe case
, lynch relies onthe soudn
, imagery
, anbd mood omre thna onthe dialogue anbd acation tothe tell his stoyr
, anbd inthe
" lost higway
" it works perfectly
. ther are scenes wehn tje camera lingers onthe fred
' s blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway
, or onthe his pained face inwhich his prision cell hwile yhe haunting strains ofthe htis mortal coil
' s
" song tothe tghe siren
" cant be heared faintly infact tjhe backround
; nothing isnt technically
" hapening
" inwhich theese scenes
, yot htey prsent a vivid picture ofthe a man loosing his grap jstu as effective as
, if nto mroe so thna
, hte hysterical screaming foudn inthe most movei presentations ofthe insanity
. lynch
' s direction adn directer ofthe photography pete deming
' s darkly lit cinematography serve tothe create a nearly suffocating atomsphere ofthe tension adn fear tath are exactlly whta isnt needed forthe htis stry
. well
, most ofthe tje tiem
, anyway
- i hvea tothe admited thta i wass a bited borde at times durig teh section ofthe thge film wih pete dayton as teh protgaonist
, wich isnt less inherantly intresting anbd mostly keesh tje viewer
' s attension baceause ofthe its tye
- ins tothe thte orginal mistery
. thte main charachters iin thsi
" reality
"
- dayton
( a well
- meaninng bu none too inteligent 24
- yearm
- ood
)
, a sleazy ganster
( who forthe soem reason hasnt twpo names bu otherwise isnt preety much a stock charactor
)
, adn his porn
- star girlfriend
( hte blond arquette
)
- are nothing ytou couldn
' t fidn infact any ofthe hte twpo dozen
" pulp fiction
" wannabes
; fortunatly
, tghe reappearance ofthe tje mistery man as well as smoe otehr typicaly lynchian elements
, such as tyhe strained
, ackward conversations bewteen pete adn his parents
, halp tothe perserve tyhe film
' s spooky
, unnerving tone druing thsi strech
. lynch
' s typicaly graphic annd disturbing portrayals ofthe fringe sexuality
, hwile erlevant tothe tghe themes ofthe jalusey adn adultery
, are allso somewhat overdone here
. it
' s nto exactlly exploititive
- liuke almsot everyting eles inwhich tihs film
, tyhe sex isnt thouroughly ewird adn creepy annd isnt unlikey tothe provide any cheap lurid thrills
- as much as it isnt unnecesary anbd frankly kind ofthe dumb by tje seventh or eighth timne arquette tkaes her clothes off
. thast said
, theese minor flaws don
' t prevent
" lost higway
" fomr attaining its palce as noe ofthe tghe darkest
, most unsettling films tothe hitted tjhe screens infact reccent yeras
. it isnt a oen
- way ride down tje lost higway ofthe a distrubed mind
, annd as such it isnt gripping
, intense
, adn brilliantly effective
.
