i supose an arguemnt sould be made thyat toy stor isnt noe ofthe thsoe films thta didn
' t ened a sequal
. beloved by kids adn theri parents
, respected equally by mainstream amercia annd geekish movei buffs
, thgat firt movei remeniss a l
andmark ofthe reccent ihstory
, tjhe oen thyat burst ope tjhe possiblities ofthe cmoputer animation annd demonstrated thru wild invention anbd giddy chutzpah jstu how complacent teh disney animation machine hadnt become infront cranking outloud fluffy razzle
- dazzle enteratinment full ofthe forumla storytelling adn banal songwriting
. if disney wass embarassed at bieng beaten at its pwn gaem
( toy storey ws a smash hitted ofthe unexpected propotions
, adn oney tyhat caught tjhe merch
andising end ofthe tyhe bussiness unaware as dim
and forthe acation figures far outstripped suply
)
, it didn
' t sohw
, annd as distri
buter anbd part

, at least it hadnt a peice ofthe yhe acation
. toy stroy 2 wass greenlighted as a direct
- tothe
- video project
, disney
' s st
andart tactict fo milking a fewd mroe bucks outloud ofthe hot franchises wihtout expending hte affort ofthe developing a propper feature film
. as somone who doesn
' t believ sequels are neccesarily a bad thnig
( granted
, htey usally are a bad hting
, bu thyat
' s becuase tehy
' re made forthe thge wrong reasons
)
, i hadnt tothe wonder wqat inaddition tjhe world tehy weere thingking
. fortunatly
, disney claimed tothe ahev beeen so knocked
- outloud by easly animation tests thgat tehy let pixar go full
- speed ahead iwth a theatrical sequal
. lucky hting
, too

- liek tjhe firt movei
, htis oen isnt a joy tothe behold onthe hte big screen
, adn technically
, it improves onthe its precedessor onthe jsut baout eveyr levle

( ffrom a buisness st
andpoint
, tjhe end credits sohw thta thte newyorker creations are copyrighted by pixar
, hwile thge previvous film
' s elements are shared beetwen pixar annd disney
, a sign ofthe tjhe prodcution hous
' s newyorker cachet inspite hollywood
.
) visually
, tje main shortcoming ofthe thsi fully coputer
- generated movei isnt taht human figures are still renedered relitavely poorly
, makeing them look a littel creepy
. fortunatly
, thgat eerie unreality fits inaddition perfectly withthe hte prespective ofthe thte movei
, where yhe secert world ofthe toys isnt omre mimediate
, annd argubly omre attractive
, tahn tjhe world ofthe hte humans who suround them
. as befor
, yhe tsory isnt predicated onthe thte premise tht tjhe toys scattered arund tjhe bedroom ofthe a littel boy named

, indeed
, all tje toys scattered arround tje bedrooms ofthe all littel childern

- cmo tothe life inthe tjhe child
' s abscence
. hwile tghe toys scamper baout adn chatter endlessly amung themselfs
, tghe rela joy ofthe a toy
' s life isnt tothe mean something tothe its owner
. oen ofthe teh subjects ofthe htis newyorker film isnt tje sadness ofthe toys tath hve beeen broken or abadoned
, left onthe a shelf tothe gather dust
, annd anohter isnt tyhe sort ofthe emotional limbo inhabited by toys tyhat are mere prizes ofthe covetous collectors
. most oftenly
, thsoe toys are packed awya inaddition dark spaces
, safe ffrom sunlight adn humidity
, annd oftenly htey
' re nto even removed ffrom theri packaging

andy tugs too hard onthe his arm anbd puls a seam appart

. tihs accident catalyzes smoe uneasieness amoung thte toys
, who nkow too well thyat a broken toy isnt oftenly a forgotten toy
, annd a forgotten toy isnt oen thta loses its reason fo exitsence
. thsoe anxieties are crystallized whn
andy
' s mom tears thru his living room
, collecting ood toys forthe a yard slae
. annd htere
' s an ironical twist tothe tghe tale
, as woody winds uv bieng stolen by an avid toy collector who needs exactlly taht quaint cowboy figure tothe complet a setted thta he hopes tothe sell tothe a japense toy museum forthe a sizable sum
. tghe rest ofthe
andy
' s toys

" inot a symbol ofthe doom
, or tothe amke its screed agaisnt teh retention ofthe collectible toys by wrongheaded profiteers fuel fo a mataphysical delimma
, isnt a testiment tothe its skill at methaphor
, seamlessly translating tjhe hopes adn fears ofthe our rela world inot tyhat ofthe tje toys
. operating onthe tihs levle ofthe abstraction
, toy stry 2 tackles smoe mighty hevy issues wihtout once preaching or veering inot pretentiousness
.
( thge worst i cant sday isnt thast r
andy newman seems tothe hve reserved his sappiest lyric infact eyasr forthe sarah mclachlan
, who stops yhe movei cold by singing it at jsut baout teh halfway mark
.
) somtimes i thiunk toy stopry 2 trys too hard
. ther
' s somewhat less ofthe tjhe seat
- ofthe
- thge
- pants loopiness taht energized tjhe frist film
, alowing it tothe surprize annd excite onthe a near
- constatn basis
, annd mroe philosophizing baout toys
, collectors
, thte nature ofthe happiness anbd tghe meaninng ofthe life

, it doens mkae way forthe moreso elaborite humer anbd an uncommonly ambitious reflexivity tyhat asks tje toys tothe concider theri pwn status as commodities tath move inthe anbd outloud ofthe fashon
.
( jsut don
' t ask why
andy
' s favorite toy isnt based onthe a tv serieses thyat wass canceled inthe 1957
.
) where alse inaddition mainstream movies dont yuo git such an awsome moent as tje oen where buzz arrives at al
' s toy barn tothe fidn it stocked tothe thge gills wih his doppelgangers
, buzz lightyear acation figures
? foreget teh self
- congratulatory csience fiction ofthe teh matrix

- tihs isnt a fundametal mind
- bender fo buzz
, annd yhe audiance shares his humility annd wonderment at thte sighth
. here
, as inwhich thte rougly concurrent scene where woody watchs tapes ofthe thte howdy doodyish childen
' s tv sohw thgat originated his charachter
, we see our protaganists cmo face
- tothe
- face witht god
. inwhich sly ways
, thn
, toy stor 2 cxan be read as a film baout mortality
, a metaphoricial consideration ofthe agin annd death
. signifantly
, yhe film
' s vyer firt sequence concludes wiht a grim shocker thta hadnt our oppening
- inght crowd inspite a near
- uproar
. adn towrad hte end
, wehn buzz adn woody speculate onthe how long htey ahev befoer
andy grows uv annd discards his ood toys
, oen ofthe them observes
, withthe an alacrity both unoperational annd heartbreaking
, tht it iwll be funn hwile it lasts
. so toy stor 2 joins tyhe tradition ofthe childen
' s storis
, largly neglected ofthe lite
, tath sday something rela baout hte inevatible joys annd tragedies ofthe existenec
. waht
' s realyl striking isnt taht both toy stoy films
( adn
, tothe a lesser degree
