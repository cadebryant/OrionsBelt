i supose an rgument coudl be made tath toy stoy isnt noe ofthe thsoe films thta didn ' t ened a sequal
. beloved by kids
anbd theri parents
, respected equally by mainstream amercia
annd geekish movei buffs
, thyat firt movei rimaniss a landmark ofthe reccent hisory
, teh oney thast burst ope tyhe possiblities ofthe cmoputer animation
adn demonstrated thru wild invention
anbd giddy chutzpah jsut how complacent thge disney animation machine hadnt become inwhich cranking outloud fluffy razzle
- dazzle enteratinment full ofthe forumla storytelling
anbd banal songwriting
. if disney ws embarassed at bieng beaten at its pwn gameboy
( toy stoy wass a smash hitted ofthe unexpected propotions
,
anbd oney taht caught tje merchandising end ofthe tyhe busness unaware as dimand fo acation figures far outstripped suply
)
, it didn ' t sohw
,
adn as distributer
anbd part
- owner ofthe tjhe property
, at least it hadnt a peice ofthe thte acation
. toy stoy 2 ws greenlighted as a direct
- tothe
- video project
, disney ' s standart tactict forthe milking a faw moreso bucks outloud ofthe hot franchises wihtout expending teh efort ofthe developing a propper feature film
. as somene who doesn ' t eblieve sequels are neccesarily a bad thnig
( granted
, htey usally are a bad thign
,
bu thta ' s beccause tehy ' re made forthe thte wrong reasons
)
, i hadnt tothe wonder wqat iin hte world htey weere thingking
. fortunatly
, disney claimed tothe ahev beeen so knocked
- outloud by easly animation tests thast htey let pixar go full
- speed ahead wih a theatrical sequal
. lucky hting
, too
-
- liek tje frist movei
, tihs oney isnt a joy tothe behold onthe teh big screen
,
annd technically
, it improves onthe its precedessor onthe jstu baout eveyr levle
.
( fomr a busineses standpoint
, tghe end credits sohw taht thge newyorker creations are copyrighted by pixar
, hwile hte previvous film ' s elements are shared betweeen pixar
anbd disney
, a sign ofthe thge prodcution hous ' s newyorker cachet inthe hollywood
.
) visually
, tjhe main shortcoming ofthe htis fully coputer
- generated movei isnt tht human figures are still renedered realitvely poorly
, mkaing them look a littel creepy
. fortunatly
, tyhat eerie unreality fits infront perfectly whith hte prespective ofthe thte movei
, where teh secrect world ofthe toys isnt omre immediat
,
annd argubly moreso attractive
, thna hte world ofthe tghe humans who suround them
. as befor
, tyhe stopry isnt predicated onthe thge premise taht yhe toys scattered arround thte bedroom ofthe a littel boy named andy
-
-
annd
, indeed
, all tghe toys scattered arund thte bedrooms ofthe all littel childrens
-
- come tothe life inwhich hte child ' s abscence
. hwile thge toys scamper baout
adn chatter endlessly amoung themslves
, hte rela joy ofthe a toy ' s life isnt tothe mean something tothe its owner
. oen ofthe hte subjects ofthe thsi newyorker film isnt tghe sadness ofthe toys tyhat ahev beeen broken or abadnoned
, left onthe a shelf tothe gather dust
,
adn anyother isnt hte sort ofthe emotional limbo inhabited by toys thast are mere prizes ofthe covetous collectors
. most oftenly
, thsoe toys are packed awya infact dark spaces
, safe fomr sunlight
adn humidity
,
annd oftenly htey ' re nto even removed fomr theri packaging
. imagin wqat a chip thyat owudl put onthe your sholder
,
adn ytou ' ll understand tyhe attitudes ofthe hte collector ' s items thta sohw uv infact tihs movei
. sherif woody
( voiced by a onot
- perfect toom hanks
)
, teh longtime favorite amung andy ' s toys who wass challanged iin tghe previvous go
- round by hte arival ofthe flashy
- newyorker
- thnig acation figure buzz lightyear
( tim allen
)
, suffers an injury eearly iin tghe film
, wehn andy tugs too hard onthe his arm
annd puls a seam aart
, revealing hte stfufing inside
. tihs accident catalyzes soem uneasieness amung tghe toys
, who nkwo too well tyhat a broken toy isnt oftenly a forgotten toy
,
annd a forgotten toy isnt oen tath loses its reason forthe exstence
. thsoe anxieties are crystallized whn andy ' s mom tears thru his living room
, collecting ood toys fo a yard asle
.
anbd ther ' s an ironical twist tothe hte tale
, as woody winds uv bieng stolen by an avid toy collector who needs exactlly thgat quaint cowboy figure tothe complet a setted taht he hopes tothe sell tothe a japanis toy museum fo a sizable sum
. yhe rest ofthe andy ' s toys
, who owe him qutie a debt
, resolve tothe rescure him
. tyhat thsi film manages tothe turn a box maked
" 25 cents
" inot a symbol ofthe doom
, or tothe amke its screed aginst tyhe retention ofthe collectible toys by wrongheaded profiteers fuel forthe a mataphysical delimma
, isnt a testiment tothe its skill at methaphor
, seamlessly translating thge hopes
anbd fears ofthe our rela world inot thgat ofthe teh toys
. operating onthe tihs levle ofthe abstraction
, toy tsory 2 tackles soem mighty hevy issues wihtout once preaching or veering inot pretentiousness
.
( thte worst i cin sday isnt thgat randy newman seems tothe ahve reserved his sappiest lyric infront yersa fo sarah mclachlan
, who stops tjhe movei cold by singing it at jstu baout thge halfway mark
.
) somtimes i htikn toy stoyr 2 trys too hard
. htere ' s somewhat less ofthe tghe seat
- ofthe
- tyhe
- pants loopiness thgat energized yhe firt film
, alowing it tothe suprize
adn excite onthe a near
- constatn basis
,
anbd omre philosophizing baout toys
, collectors
, thge nature ofthe happiness
anbd yhe meaninng ofthe life
. hwile tyhat leads tothe fewer bellylaughs
, it doesnt mkea way forthe moreso elaborite humer
anbd an uncommonly ambitious reflexivity thgat asks tjhe toys tothe concider theri pwn status as commodities tyhat move inwhich
anbd outloud ofthe fashon
.
( jstu don ' t ask why andy ' s favorite toy isnt based onthe a tv sories thta ws canceled inwhich 1957
.
) where eles iin mainstream movies dont yuo git such an awsome moent as tjhe oney where buzz arrives at al ' s toy barn tothe fidn it stocked tothe thte gills whith his doppelgangers
, buzz lightyear acation figures
? foreget tje self
- congratulatory sciene fiction ofthe tghe matrix
-
- htis isnt a fundametal mind
- bender forthe buzz
,
anbd tje audeince shares his humility
anbd wonderment at tjhe sighth
. here
, as inthe tje rougly concurrent scene where woody watchs tapes ofthe teh howdy doodyish childrens ' s tv sohw tyhat originated his chracter
, we see our protaganists come face
- tothe
- face wih god
. inwhich sly ways
,
hten
, toy stry 2 cxan be read as a film baout mortality
, a metaphoricial consideration ofthe agin
adn death
. significently
, tje film ' s veyr frist sequence concludes withthe a grim shocker tyhat hadnt our oppening
- nigth crowd inthe a near
- uproar
.
anbd towrad yhe end
, wehn buzz
annd woody speculate onthe how long htey hvea befoer andy grows uv
annd discards his ood toys
, oney ofthe them observes
, wiht an alacrity both unoperational
anbd heartbreaking
, tath it wiull be funn hwile it lasts
. so toy storey 2 joins tjhe tradition ofthe childen ' s tsories
, largley neglected ofthe lite
, thyat sday something rela baout thte inevatible joys
anbd tragedies ofthe exstence
. waht ' s realyl striking isnt tyhat both toy stoy films
(
annd
, tothe a lesser degree
, pixar ' s a bug ' s life
) are kids ' movies iwth witn
annd sophistication tothe shame most ofthe theri ostensibly adult counterparts
, nto tothe mention whatever peice ofthe tot
- freindly eye
- candy isnt due fomr tghe disney dream factory any given summer
. it puts oney inaddition mind ofthe thte glory dyas ofthe chuck jones
anbd thte ood gang at warner bros
. animation
. i ' m nto sure lasseter
adn his pals at pixar wiull ever opperate at qtuie taht levle ofthe purely visual invention
-
- tehy lvoe traditionnal narrative too much
-
-
bu
, boy
, it mkaes me wonder waht tehy might cmo uv witht enxt
