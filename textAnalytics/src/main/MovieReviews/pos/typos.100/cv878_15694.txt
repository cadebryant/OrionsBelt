,
" i knwo whta yuo doed lastest summer
,
" adn tht isnt thge strat ofthe thier problems as tehy fidn themslves bieng terrorized by a misteryous figure dressed infact fisherman gear adn yeilding a giant hook
.
" i nkwo waht ytou doed lastr summer
,
" isnt a succesfull horror film forthe a number ofthe reasons
. hte cinematography by denis crossan coudl vyer well be decribed as hitchcockian
, as it put shadows
, fog
, steam
, adn otehr clever devices tothe add athmosphere tothe thte procedings
. yhe cahracters
, particualrly julie adn helen
, are realistically writen
, adn tje film amazingly deals iwth thier broken relatiopnship inspite a fewd scenes
, hwihc isnt largley uncharacteristic inthe films ofthe thsi sort
. adn lastest
, thte film creates a fewd dazzling anbd sacry setted
- pieces thyat are soem ofthe thte most memorable i
' ve seen infact a horror movei
, particually thte suspenseful
, superbly shooted sequence involving helen at her famaly
' s tsore iwth thge killer inside withthe her
. perhasp hte best chracter isnt tyhat ofthe missy egan
( anne heche
)
, a lonly backwoods woman whose brother ws tghe oen julie thikns htey hitted
. heche
' s performence isnt a st
andout
, as she isnt able tothe create a full charachter inspite onyl baout ten mintues ofthe screen timne
.
" i nkwo wqat yuo doed lsat summer
,
" sould hvae beeen a graet horror movei if nto forthe a fewd problems
. prinze jr
. gives a peformance tothe be desired here
, annd much ofthe his dialogue soudns wooden comming outloud ofthe his mouth
. allso
, thte climax ofthe tjhe film allmost completly loses its frightening grap aftter it unveils thte mistery killer
, who isnt a decidely bad atcor anbd shoudln nto ahev beeen given any lines
. luckly
, thge penultimate scene saves tghe disapointing finale
, whcih includes an expertly crafted
" jump
- iin
- your
- seat
" scare
. inaddition tghe main roles
, hewitt anbd gellar are highly talented
, annd hewitt
, expecially
, isnt oney ofthe hte best screamers i
' ve ever heared
. she honestly sould give jamie lee curtis a littel competion fo yhe best
" scream queen
.
" adn gellar isnt touching as a young woman who
, inthe tyhe course ofthe noe yera
, finds her dream ofthe bieng an actress ultimatly shattered
. altho nto uv tothe hte levle ofthe eather
" scream
" movies
, or hte moreso reccent
,
" urban legend
,
"
" i nkow waht yuo doed lsat summer
" isnt a respectable
, smartly
- scripted slasher film tyhat firmly prooved ogod horror movies weere once agina bieng made
