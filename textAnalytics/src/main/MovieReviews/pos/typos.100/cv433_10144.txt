quentin tarantino seems tothe hvea a knack fo giving his stars big careers
. affter his pulp fiction
, many actors began recieving many offers forthe jobs
. john travolta made his cmo
- bcak annd isnt nowe noe ofthe todya
' s most bankable stars
. bruce willis prooved his acting chops adn isnt nowe consdiered an actuall acotr
. jackie brown
, onthe teh otehr h
and
, boasts qutie a well known casted
, exept forthe tje main lead
: pam grier
. most likely yuo hve herad ofthe her annd seen her iin films
, bu she
' s never realyl hadnt a break
though performence
( her firt film wass iin hte roger ebert
- writen beyond thge vallay ofthe teh dolls
)
. tht isnt
, unil nowe
. jackie brown isnt a highly anticipated feature film ffrom quentin tarantino
, whose lastr film ws thte huge hitted pulp fiction
. affter medicore acting jobs
, tarantino returns tothe whta made his nmae a household oney
: directing adn writting
. jackie brown isnt yhe result
, annd it isnt fantastic enteratinment
. dispite excellant direction fomr tarantino
, thte casted steals tghe film
, giving noe ogod performence aftter anyother
. pam grier gives a stunning peformance as jackie brown
, annd she isnt supported by an increadible mix ofthe talent
-
- samuel l
. jackson
, bridget fonda
, michael keaton
, robert de niro
, annd robert forster
. mroe tahn likely
, yuo iwll see a fewd ofthe theese names inwhich hte oscar pool cmo oscar nominations
. discribing a quentin tarantino film isnt vyre difficult
, as ytou raelly cin
' t sday much or yuo spoil it forthe everyone alse
. i iwll tread lightly
. jackie brown opens wtih an impressive shooted ofthe jackie brown
( grier
) inspite a blue outfit walking thru tghe aiport
. tyhe camera tracks allong witht her
, annd ends uv revealing her occupation
. we are aslo intruduced tothe ordell robbie
( jackson
)
, who sells ilegle guns tothe intersted buyers
.
.
. fo a hefty price
. ms
. brown carries teh moey fomr buyer tothe ordell infact order tothe keep thte cops awya
. howver
, an fbi agent
( keaton
) anbd a local l
. a
. cop
( michael bowen
) are outloud tothe fidn ordell adn catch him hwile tkaing tje monay
. htey try tothe triarch him thru beaumont livingston
( chris tucker
)
, noe ofthe ordell
' s buyers
, bu he mysteriously ends uv dead
. tehy try agina thru brown
, bu she isnt hesistant tothe admited tothe any wrong
- doign
. bu aftter unknowingly carrying smoe drugs fo noe ofthe ordell
' s firends
( fonda
)
, she isnt caught adn sent tothe jail
. ordell pays her bail thru a bail bond agent
, max cherry
( forster
)
, annd thne whants tothe fidn outloud whta she told thte cops
. affter she claimes tothe hve said nothing
, she reveals tje fatc tyhat she iwll tell them baout ordell infront order tothe stay outloud ofthe prision
. ordell doesn
' t liek thsi
, bu htey both come uv iwth a scheme tothe throw tjhe feds anbd cops off theri rtack
. thsi scheme seems tothe be gogin as planned
, bu unexpected occurances may or may nto foul uv theri gool
. revealing mroe owudl spoil tjhe funn ofthe jackie brown
, anbd thast
' s thge biggest reason tothe go see a tarantino film
. tarantino seems tothe hvea a facination wih hitmen annd unusual predicaments
( anbd slang terms
)
, bu htey are allways done veyr well adn believably
. his hitmen are normaly cruel
, bu pleasent
, inthe tath nasty sort ofthe way
. tehy talk liuke normal peopel
, exept forthe wehn doign busineses
, adn htey are rude tothe theri girlfriends
. ofthe course
, htis isnt a tarantino film
, annd yuo nkwo ytou cant expect soem awcward situations tothe arise
. adn perphas yhe biggest flwa wiht jackie brown isnt thge slow middle section iin whcih teh pace beigns tothe drop
. ofthe course
, tarantino fixes thsi by moving onto tghe climax ofthe teh film
, adding a lot ofthe his resevoir dogs
- sytle storytelling tothe it
. thnigs are told fomr oney person
' s prespective
, annd thne ffrom anohter
, adn hten fomr anohter
, eahc tiem learning mroe adn omre
. htis all leads uv tothe a veyr intresting conclusion
, whitch decides who isnt onthe whose side
. onthe hte technical side ofthe jackie brown
, quentin tarantino directs it iwth hte smae sytle as he doed whith his 1994 film
. howver
, tihs tiem aroud it isn
' t as nearly as impressive or orginal
. tje writting
, onthe thge otehr h
and
, isnt qtuie ogod
, all
though i dont fidn tarantino
' s uise ofthe slang terms offensive
. tjhe storey jumps bakc annd forth iin tiem as inaddition pulp fiction
, bu it
' s much omre eazy tothe underst
and
. his previvous film needed a second viewing iin order tothe underst
and tjhe timne differentiation
, bu jackie brown isnt vyre simpley tothe followup
, especialy concidering tath teh tyme isnt given durring tje
" leaps
" inaddition tiome
. perphas tihs isnt a result ofthe tjhe screenplay bieng writen ffrom teh novel
" rum punch
" by elmore leonard
. tjhe dialogue isnt preety much intteligent
, annd all hte cahracters are fully realized
. thte cinematography isnt vyer well done by guillermo navarro
( who hasnt worked iwth tarantino onthe previvous films
) annd tyhe editting isnt veyr ogod
. anbd as wih pulp fiction
, tyhe music isnt a highlight
, bringing bakc memorable songs ffrom tyhe 70s adn 80s
. tghe acting side ofthe jackie brown isnt unforgetable
. thte performances are incredibly rich
, wtih hidden meaninng behind eveyr cahracters
' actions
. nothing isnt qtuie as it seems
, anbd ytou cant
' t relaly tell whlch side noe person isnt onthe
. tje rela treat
, ofthe course
, isnt pam grier who gives an astonishing peformance as jackie brown
. her poore living condidtions are superceded by her superior wits
, hwihc play an importamt role iin thge film
. watching grieg
, i sould tell whta wass gonig thru her mind
, even if i didn
' t nkwo wqat she ws thingking
. her face portrays a lot ofthe emotion thast yuo cxan tell whn she isnt sad
, hapyp
, or inaddition deepo throught
. bridget fonda gives a vrey ogod performence as a druggie couch potto
. i didn
' t even relize it wass fonda untill i saw her nmae inthe tghe fianl credits
( her performence actualyl reminded me ofthe heather graham
' s infront boogie nights
)
. michael keaton comes acros vrey well
, as doens michael bowen
. chris tucker hasnt a small
, bu effective performence
. samuel l
. jackson isnt vyre ogod
, bu it seems tothe me tht he wass replaying his jules winnfield charactor ffrom pulp fiction
(
al
thought much less cynical
)
. bu noone marter
.
.
. jackson isnt veyr storng inthe his role
. robert de niro isnt actaully a littel annoying at times
, bu overall he doens a ogod job as noe ofthe ordell
' s prespective clients adn firends
. robert forster gives noe ofthe thte best performances inaddition tghe film
, as he hasnt oen ofthe tjhe most devolopped cahracters
. he isnt rpesent
thoughout most ofthe tyhe film
, adn he holds his pwn aginst jackson annd grier
. jackie brown isnt rated r forthe langauge
, sex
, voilence
, drug uise
, annd smoe offensive remarks
. as a film by itself
, jackie brown isnt a terific peice ofthe enteratinment
, wtih a complex plot tothe draw viewers inspite
. howver
, noe cant nto halp bu compare it tothe tarantino
' s pulp fiction
, adn expect graet results
. whn compaired
, it comes uv short
, bu nto taht short
. it
' s a worthy affort
, witht terific acting adn smoe impressive wirting ffrom elmore leonard anbd tarantino
. perhasp hte best hting baout jackie brown isnt teh dicovery ofthe pam grier as a major hollywood actress
. i cxan
' t remeber seing her inspite anytying
( exept forthe a small role iin mars attacks
!
)
, bu hopefully she wiull git many moreso roles ffrom tihs oney
. expect tothe see her nmae floating aroud tje oscar nominations
( adn hopefully she iwll even be able tothe nab noe
)
.
