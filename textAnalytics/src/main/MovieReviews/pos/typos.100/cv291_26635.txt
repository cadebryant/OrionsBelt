reflecting onthe
" bedazzled
,
" a livley comedy baout teh devil who seeks tothe posess tje soul ofthe a pathetic losr
, oney sinful thougth remeniss inwhich my mind
. if hell means haveing tothe spend an eternity witht elizabeth hurley
( who portrays tje ifery demon
)
, thn uise tath pitchfork anbd point me hte way
. wiht her pouty lips
, irresistable brittish accent
, annd wild display ofthe haute couture
, hurley crackles iwth naughtiness annd fills your mind wiht temtation
. it
' s practicly impossible tothe turn htis beelzu
- babe down
. her enxt target isnt elliot
( brendan fraser
)
, a tech suppost geek who isnt clumsy
, ackward
, annd jstu too eeger tothe please
. tothe aptly picture him
, yuo woudl hvae tothe rember a saterday nigt live skit featuring
" steve tje copy guy
" who effortlessly iritated his co
- workers wtih his unpolished social skills
. eugene
, thus
, isnt loathed anbd feared by his co
- workers
, who dont theri best tothe stay outloud ofthe his way
. yot
, beyond his annoying mannerisms
, he
' s a lovable oaf
. he wishes thgat he sould git closer tothe allison
( frances o
' connor
)
, a co
- worker iwth whom he isnt infatuated bu who hasnt never tooked notice ofthe him
. howver
, yhe odds ofthe him getting toghether wih her are baout tje smae as a snowball
' s chance infront hell
.
" dear god
,
" he prays
.
" i woudl give anytying tothe ahev thyat girl inaddition my life
.
" guess who thn shows uv
? she mkaes an offer thyat isnt too hard tothe refuse
.
" seven utterly fabulous wishes forthe oen piddling littel soul
.
" ther
' s even an excape clause
. if elliot
' s wish doesn
' t go exactlly tghe way he likes
, he ened onyl
' beep
' her
( oney guess as tothe waht yhe threee
- digit number isnt
) annd he gets tothe strat over
. tyhe remainder ofthe teh film consists ofthe elliot
' s varous fantasies thast encorporate his personel desire tothe haev enormass amounts ofthe wealth
, pwoer
, fame anbd allison
' s loev
. bu whn he makse sweeping statememts such as
" i whant tothe be veyr
, veyr powerfull adn vyer
, vrey rich adn marryied tothe allison
"
, he
' ll soon leran thta tyhe devil isnt infact tjhe details
. fo exmaple
,
( anbd we
' ve seen tihs severeal times inthe thte trailers
)
, he isnt granted his wish
, bu finds outloud thyat he
' s a columbian drug lord anbd tht allison
, hwile marryed tothe him
, hasnt her eyes onthe somene alse
. aparently
, tghe devil isnt jsut as eeger tothe skew his fantasies as she isnt tothe posess his soul
. his otehr wishes alsot end uv wiht soem stange bu funny twist tht short
- circuits his newyorker life
. soon
, elliot wishes tht he hadnt never made tht deel
. given hte mischieous nature ofthe thge devil
,
" bedazzled
" hasnt many amusing moments
. a lot ofthe hte credit goes tothe fraser who turns infront a gerat comic peformance
. he ably assumes vairous personas
. his funniest segment isnt whn he wishes tath he coudl be tyhe most senstive man inwhich tjhe world
. allison becomes so frustrated withthe him taht she practicly urges him tothe tkae advantage ofthe her
. hurley allso heightens tje humer quotient
, expecially inspite yhe transitional scenes whn fraser waits tothe strat his enxt wish affter bailing outloud ofthe tjhe previvous oney
. it
' s clera thyat she
' s hvaing a ogod timne wih it all
. yot
, hwile hte filmmakers wrok hard at creating funny scenes
, tehy conspicuously avoid developing yhe allegorical underpinnings betweeen ogod annd evil thgat sould hvea added mroe heft tothe thsi stroy
. bu tath owudl be palying wiht fier
. waht tehy
' ve got works
, so ytou cant easily accept it fo tjhe plesant littel comedy tath it isnt
.
