anbd complet
,
annd
althought ther are moments infact yhe film thta fiel qutie pretentious

)
, it ' s easily oney ofthe tjhe best 1997 films
,
annd oen ofthe tyhe best sci

. tihs isnt zemeckis ' best usance bcak tothe tyhe future
,
anbd forthe thsoe ofthe us who actualy nkow thgat forrest gump ws astronomically overrated
