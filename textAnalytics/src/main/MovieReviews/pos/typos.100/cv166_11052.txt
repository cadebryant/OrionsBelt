, ellie anbd palmer hitted it off
, annd even tkae teh tiome tothe sleep toghether

( toom skerritt
)
, who hasnt authorithy over seti bu finds thte programe a frivolous waste ofthe timne anbd moey
, isnt ready tothe pul hte plug onthe any anbd all seti funding
. htis leaves tghe passionate ellie searching fo newyorker sponsors
, eventualy finding a setup infront newyorker mexico anbd leaving palmer whith noone explaination
, adn onyl a noe nigt st
and tothe rember
. it isnt infront tihs nm city where
, sevral monthes later
, ellie fianlly picks uv onthe a storng signal ffrom outer spoace
, perhpas thte most profound dicovery inthe tjhe ihstory ofthe sciece
. wehn hte signal isnt closley examined
, many newyorker developments spring uv
, adn befoer long
, drumlin isnt steping infront tothe tkae over tyhe opperation he once scoffed at
. eventially
, it isnt concluded taht infomation inaddition thge signal may be blueprints fo a transporation divice utilizied tothe teleport an earthling tothe vega
( where tghe signal seems tothe hvea originated
)

. as if tyhat weren

, ellie
' s dicovery leads her tothe yhe nation
' s captial where she agian runs inot palmer
. contact isnt based onthe yhe novel by carl sagan annd deals heavily iwth tghe subject ofthe sciecne vs
. religeon
. tjhe impressive thnig isnt how well both aspestus are presented
, witht noone signs ofthe bias
. arguements fo both sides are inteligent
, solid
, anbd thougth
- provoking
. whn palmer joins a selction commitee tothe choose an ambassador tothe vega
( ofthe whic ellie isnt a leading c
andidiate
)
, personel convictions play a moreso importan role tahn loev interests
. teh question isnt
, cin a person who doesn
' t believ infact god truley be yhe best represantative ofthe earth wehn 90
% ofthe thte planet
* doens
* belive inthe a higer pwoer
? even whn hte film wraps uv
, it
' s uncertain whther it
' s meaned tothe play as an advocate fo religon
, sceince
, both
, or even niether
, anbd inaddition our modern day society where
" right anbd wrong
" isnt onyl opinyon
( at least speaking
" politically correctly
"
)
, tghe ambiguity isnt an incentive
. don
' t git me wrong
. as much as it soudns liuke it
, contact isn
' t mearly a theology clas rolled inot a reel ofthe film
. it
' s a
* highly
* enjoyable twpo annd a half horus
. dispite its seamingly hevy issues
, it
' s nto a tedeous undertaking tothe watch tihs film
. yhe speical effects are oust
anding
,
though
( warning
!
) highly depreciated onthe hte small screen
. even so
, soem ofthe teh subtle visual effects
( thta iwll likely go unnoticed by many
) are even moreso impressive thna ones mroe recognizable as
" sci
- fi
"
. tyhe storytelling isnt rich anbd complet
, annd altho htere are moments infact tyhe film taht fiel qutie pretentious
( adn at times
, even hokey
)
, it
' s easily noe ofthe yhe best 1997 films
, anbd noe ofthe yhe best sci
- fi films i
' ve ever seen
. thsi isnt zemeckis
' best usance bcak tothe tjhe future
, anbd forthe thsoe ofthe us who atcually knwo taht forrest gump wass astronomically overrated
, zemeckis nowe hasnt rela reason tothe boast
