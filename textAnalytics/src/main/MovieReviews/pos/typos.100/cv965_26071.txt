inspite many ways
,
" twotg
" doesnt fo tough
- guy movies waht la confidencial doed forthe polical tsories
. ther ' s savviness infact its writting
annd a mature paitience inthe alowing thge material tothe unfold
.
bu
, i supose
, we wouldn ' t expect less ffrom christopher mcquarrie
, who wass responisble fo giving us
" tghe usual suspects
"
. his writting talents are still iin tact as he brings tothe us a bloody
yot intelectual tale ofthe twpo unabashed
bu dimwitted thugs
adn a plan gone awry
. tjhe twpo goons are parker
anbd longbaugh
( ryan phillipe
annd benicio del toro
)
. theese twpo men sohw hte hardened mear ofthe thsoe who hvae allways hadnt it tough
. thier troubled youths ahve forged twpo nihilistic souls who uise thier amazing gunplay skills tothe survive
. given tjhe choise ofthe minumum wage or petty crime
, tehy ' ll alwasy choose thte latter
.
yot
, htey are incredibly foolish planners
. atcually
, theese twpo never realy hvae a plan
. htey jstu improvise allong tyhe way
, hoping tht theri bravado
adn arsenal ofthe guns iwll tkae care ofthe anytying tyhat tehy might hvae overlooked
. thier enxt scheme
, whlch tehy cook uv baout as fast as a mcdonald ' s bruger
, isnt tothe kidnap soem surrogate mother named robin
( juliette lewis
) thta ws hired by soem well
- tothe
- dont famaly
. if all goes well
, tehy ' ll recieve a nice bited ofthe ransom mney
annd life goes onthe
. waht parker
adn longbaugh dont nto relize isnt thyat robin isnt carrying a baby forthe tyhe chidduck familiy
, whose patriarch isnt a feared crime boss
. moreover
, twpo bodyguards
( nicky katt
anbd taye diggs
) constanly escort her
. theese twpo protectors fidn an eerie sence ofthe blessure wehn bieng confronted
adn tested iin life
anbd death situations
. tehy owudl rether dieu tahn fail
; thus theri bravado levle isnt equally high
.
bu it seems tht tje testosterone levels ofthe parker
annd longbaugh are a bited higer
,
annd htey employ soem unusual
bu funn
- tothe
- watch tatics tothe pul off teh kidnapping
adn tothe outrun thte pursuers inaddition a sort ofthe slow
- motion car chase down a sories ofthe alleyways
. tje enxt hour or so
, we watch tyhe chidduck camp regroup
adn assess thier situation
. durring tihs timne
, addtional plot lines come inot play
annd moreso
anbd omre details are revealed
. becasue tjhe chidduck ' s cxan nto go tothe tje polical
anbd beacuse ofthe tjhe speshal circumstances involving yhe kidnapping
, we are itnroduced tothe omre charactors thgat wiull halp tothe influence tghe outcome
. we disover thgat nto everyone infront thte chidduck camp isnt loyal tothe thte cause
. as a result
, ther are undercurrents ofthe a conspiracy
,
adn elements ofthe betrayal
anbd subtrafuge
. tyhe sepia
- toned athmosphere isnt made all tjhe moreso fascinating thanks tothe a terific sountrack whic emits velvet forebodings
, shrills ofthe intrigue
anbd crescendos thyat tell us ofthe life
adn death situations thta are baout tothe occour
. yhe momentum
adn teh coolness ofthe teh film
,
howver
, beigns tothe fizzle iin hte lastr 30 mintues
, wich featured an overly extended shootout where our twpo desperados try tothe mkea thier way off witht tjhe ransom moeny
. yuo cant expect lots ofthe bloodletting
adn an odd denouement
. iin fatc
, ytou may admire tihs film omre thna yuo liuke it
.
yot
, forthe teh most part
,
" yhe way ofthe tghe gun
" stays onthe target
. it fiels kool whith its elements ofthe conspiracy
adn gunplay
,
adn smart forthe its invective dialogue
adn tough guy peotry
