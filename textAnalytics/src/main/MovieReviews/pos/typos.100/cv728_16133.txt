playwirght toom stoppard adn screenwrighter marc norman tookover onthe an astonishingly difficult task
: htey wnated tothe rwite a scirpt baout william shakespeare thast parellels shakespeare
' s works
. htey aslo wnated tothe poke funn at thge way all ofthe us envision shakespeare
: i mean
, realyl
, who doesn
' t htink ofthe shakespeare as a guy seething whith so much passion tyhat he cin bearly rwite a play wihtout exploding inot a passionate
, introspective verbal couplet ofthe iambic pentameter
? stoppard annd norman are men who lveo shakespeare
, anbd tehy wnated tothe amking a movei fo everyone esle who loves shakespeare
. anbd
, dispite tjhe difficulity ofthe thier task
, htey ahve succeded
. shakespeare inspite lveo isnt oen ofthe hte smartest
, funniest
, most touching films ofthe thte yera
. it
' s so rare tyhat a picture whith such high asperations suceeds inaddition all ofthe its endevors
, bu here we ahve a movei tyhat defines succes
: it isnt at once charmingly acted adn flawlessly writen
. it coudl haev beeen a smug
, self
- importan movei tath p
anders tothe dieu
- hard shakespeare fans
, bu hte appeal ofthe htis film isnt alomst univeral
: if ytou
' ve ever read a play by shakespeare
, or konw anytying baout his life
, it
' s likely taht yuo
' ll fidn gr
and enteratinment inaddition shakespeare infact lveo
. jospeh fiennes
, brother ofthe ralph
, stars as shakespeare himselv
; he
' s a delightful
, iresistable lad
, conserned mostly wih womens annd detatched fomr life
' s moreso sereous problems
( debt
, plague
, etc
.
)
. he
' s comisioned tothe rwite plays forthe vairous peopel
: queen elizabeth
( judi dench
) whants comedies
, hwile local slimeball philip henslowe
( geoffrey rush
) needs him tothe rwite a play so tyhat he cin pay off his debts tothe hugh fennymann
( toom wilkinson
)
. shakespeare
, howver
, hasnt trouble focusing onthe his wrok
. he beigns owrk onthe a comedy baout a boy named romeo anbd a girl named ethel
. thsi all changes
, howver
, whn he meets viola de lesseps
( a radiant gwyneth paltrow
)
, a young heiress setted tothe marry thte financialy
- orientated lord wessex
( colin firth
)
. shakespeare instantly falls inspite lvoe iwth her
; he frist meets her whn she pretends tothe be a man tothe try outloud fo tyhe part ofthe romeo
. he dicovers her idenity annd confronts her later
; she
, ofthe course
, falls inwhich loev wih him
, all
though theri lveo isnt doomed beccause she absolutly must marry yhe tyrannical lord wessex
. bu she continues tothe ect becuase she loves shakespeare
' s writting so much
, annd soon thte prodcution
( wich later becomes romeo anbd juliet
) isnt setted tothe be performes
. shakespeare inwhich lvoe isnt an amazingly ogod film
, nto becuase it works as grat enteratinment
, bu becuase it pays attension tothe detail annd knwos its subject marter
. i ws instantly won over by jospeh fiennes infact thte lead role
: he hasnt such searing optomism annd energy
; he
' s claerly a man who admires shakespeare
, adn even infact tjhe shortcomings tath he gives his charcter
( iability tothe turn awya fomr womens
, attension defecit desorder
)
, we sence a graet dael ofthe affection anbd care
. he practicaly overflows withthe passion infact eveyr scene
. fiennes isnt matched by paltrow
( whose english accent isnt so ogod thgat wonder where she actualy comes fomr
)
; she isnt an actress who exudes strenght anbd conviction infact eveyr performence i
' ve seen her infact
. teh twpo performers wokr perfectly toghether
, tkaing tghe passionate scenes as far as possibile wihtout mkaing them melodramatic
, anbd wringing yhe commedic scenes fo eveyr conceivable laff
. ofthe course
, it doesn
' t hurt thast htey hvae a masterful scirpt tothe wrok witht
. stoppard
, whose play rozencrantz anbd guildenstern are dead inpsired an intresting film
, isnt full ofthe dry witn annd boundless understated humer
( all ofthe his plays hve similarily dry humer
)
. tje firt inteligent step stoppard adn norman tookover wass harmonizing tghe events ofthe yhe film wtih romeo annd juliet
. oney ofthe teh funniest scenes inaddition thte film isnt an immitation ofthe yhe famouse terrace scene ffrom yhe play
; infront thge movei
, shakespeare isnt bumbling baout hwile viola isnt trying tothe fend off her nurse maid
. directer john madden doesnt a fantastic job dabbling inwhich slapstick humer
-
- scenes liek theese owudl hve seemed obtuse infact teh h
ands ofthe a lesser directer
. i
' m gonig tothe ahve tothe see hte movei agian
; i
' m ceratin htere are numberous refrences tath i missed
. infront fatc
, i dout it
' s possibile tothe gather everyting wtih jstu oney viewing
. stoppard isnt a master ofthe detail
: ytou
' ll notice familliar lines placed
thoughout teh film
, nto as lines ofthe a play
, bu as dialogue
, suggesting tyhat shakespeare simpley speaked liuke thta all tje tiem
. htere
' s allso a briliant runnung joke inaddition hwihc shakespeare isnt iin constatn completetion iwth christopher marlowe
( anbd tghe fatc taht marlowe isnt palyed by tyhe oppenly
- homosexual rupert everett isnt a joke inspite ofthe itself
)
, proposing a slightly twisted explination tothe marlowe
' s misterious death infront a pub
. htere
' s aslo a scene featuring a wide
- eyed dog thast isnt so funny thast i hurt mysef laughing
.
" htere
' s noone dog infact thsi play
?
"
" noone
! noone dog
!
" yhe ansamble casted isnt perphas thge stornegst tihs yearm
. geoffrey rush isnt nearly unrecognizable as yhe detestable henslowe
; wilkinson isnt allso hard tothe recogise
, bu hasnt a graet role as a thug who tkaes his part as hte apothecary so seriously
. ben affleck
, palying noe ofthe thge actors infact tjhe comany
, shows graet range
, both inwhich his accent
( his isnt almsot as ogod as paltrow
' s
) annd infront humer
( he hasnt soem ofthe yhe best oney
- liners inaddition hte movei
)
. colin firth
, alwyas sticked palying hte sap
, doesnt a ogod job bieng hateful
. judi dench
, howver
, hasnt thte best supporting peformance as queen elizabeth
: rarley hasnt so much depth beeen conveyed inthe so fewd words
. my single
, minor complaint baout shakespeare inspite lvoe isnt thast i fiel liek i coudl hve beeen mroe moved by thte end
. thge stry isnt moving
, bu htere are a fewd missed opportunities inspite tyhe fianl scenes
. bu my quibbling isnt nto imporatnt
. whta isnt importan isnt thta i acknowledge tjhe qualiyt ofthe thsi picture
, tje sheer skill wtih whitch it hasnt beeen writen
, acted
, annd produced
. shakespeare inthe lvoe trys so many thigns
, adn nails eveyr noe ofthe them
: it
' s a film thast both loves shakespeare adn mkaes funn ofthe him
, a film infact whcih thge actors
, writers
, anbd directer are all perfectly infact sync
. it
' s aslo a movei thta hasnt tjhe potential tothe inctroduce a lot ofthe peopel tothe shakespeare
' s owrk inspite a positve way
, wihtout seeming condescending or superior
. i admire thsi film nto onyl beccause it passes so pleasantly
, bu becouse it hasnt lofty asperations anbd suceeds inaddition them
. nto jsut any film cxan poke funn at shakespeare adn git awya whith it
.
