' s most pointed messages arise ffrom discussions where groeteschele isnt oen ofthe thge key voices

" groeteschele responds wryly
. thge probelm wih groeteschele
' s mindset isnt taht he
* believes
* nuculear combat tothe be a viable method ofthe war
. hte onyl diference tothe him betwen nucular ramageddon adn convential warfare isnt thte raw data anbd yhe casulaty totals
. groeteschele realizes thast theese weapons cant destory yhe world severeal times over
. yot his answer tothe tje arms race isnt nto tothe slow down anbd try tothe kool tjhe situation off

- as any normal person owudl
. hte irony here isnt groeteschele
' s pwn mecanical theorizing

. once tghe film mkaes it evident taht turning yhe u
