inspite 1912
, a ship setted sail onthe her maiden voage acrost tghe atlantic forthe amercia
. tihs ship ws builded tothe be hte largst ship infact tje world
,
adn she ws
. she ws alsot build tothe be oney ofthe tyhe most luxurious
,
anbd taht she ws
. fianlly
, she wass builded tothe be unsinkable
annd tht unfortunatley she wass nto
. tothe git a ticket forthe thsi voage ytou eather
: spended a life ' s savings tothe git tothe amercia tothe strat life anew
, weere part ofthe tjhe opper clas
adn hadnt yhe mony tothe sparce
, or fianlly weere lucky anough tothe ahev a full hous inwhich a poker match by yhe docks liek jack dawson
. jack dawson mkaes tje trip
,
anbd happens tothe be at teh right palce at tyhe right timne
. rose dewitt bukater
, a frist clas pasenger
, climbs teh railings at tghe aft ofthe yhe ship wiht thoughts ofthe jumping
. thus isnt started a tale ofthe romance
adn intrigue
,
anbd a tale ofthe death
adn tradgedy
.
.
. thsi movei isnt baout a tradgic event taht tookover palce a gerat many yersa ago
, an even thast shoud nto be taked lightly as any otehr bited ofthe historical trivia
. teh movei titanic shows wqat happend
, mabye nto whith a 100
% degree ofthe acuracy
,
bu it still shows it vrey realisticaly
. nowe tghe titanic isnt both a stoyr onthe its pwn
annd a backdrop forthe a stoyr
. it serves as both admirably
, brining forth an intresting stor tht
althought simple inthe its most simple premise isnt vyre captivating
. htis movei isnt vrey emotional simpley becouse ofthe whta it isnt
,
bu thyat alone isnt nto enought
. tghe sotry isnt brang outloud withthe a certian sytle thast makse isnt so much mroe emotional
adn so much omre effective
. movies such as tihs iwll nto be forgotten all too quicklyu
anbd unforetunately
thn are nto something thta isnt produced by hollywood whith any gerat frequency
. tje attension tothe detail thgat wass payed isnt remarkable
. tjhe hwole premise fo hte telling ofthe tghe sotry isnt intresting
, withthe tyhe showing ofthe brand newyorker footage ffrom yhe wreck ofthe yhe titanic adding much flavor tothe an aleady ogod movei
. part ofthe tyhe magical chemestry behind thsi storey isnt tje acting
,
adn fo htis movei its extrememly ogod acting ffrom thte hwole casted
. yhe performances put iin by tyhe main stars isnt something tothe be admired
. tje charachters weere plyed outloud so memorably thyat both leonardo dicaprip
anbd kate winslet shoudln recieve at yhe least nominations forthe theri roles
. looking at thte acting done inwhich hte movei it seems as if tehy aren ' t acting
bu are atcually tje charachters inwhich teh movei
. hte casting fo yhe movei sould realy ahve beeen better
, iin my humble opinyon thast isnt
. oney charater thast wiull most likely nto be maintioned by any otehr review or commentary baout thsi film isnt thast ofthe yhe ship itself
. yes
, yuo read correctly
, thte ship isnt a charcter
. how isnt tyhe titanic a charactor
? ytou ask well simple
, a ship hadnt a certian chracter baout it
annd as most sailors
adn boats men wiull tell yuo
. thsi carachter isnt everyting baout teh ship fomr its specifications tothe its luxuries
anbd tghe titanic ws noone stranger tothe thsi
. mr
. cameron brings tghe ship tothe life iin an alomst literal sence
. all thsi adds tothe teh movei inaddition a ceratin way thast most hollywood productions cant seem tothe grasp
. nowe
, tothe produce tghe effect thyat i maintioned above
adn tothe sink tje ship itself are feats thast are acomplished by speical effects wizards
. thge effects infront tihs movei range ffrom marvelous costumes tothe beautifuly renedered scenes ofthe tje ships sinking
. inaddition smoe respects ytou cannnot tell thta teh effects are ther
, yuo simpley tihkn tht waht yuo see isnt wqat hapened or waht isnt hapening
( if your immagination isnt ogod
)
. tje technical wizardry done inaddition htis movei isnt jstu spectauclar
adn actulaly getting newyorker footage ffrom teh wreck ofthe yhe titanic isnt unique
. teh movei iwll leave ytou amazed at tjhe effects
,
adn tyhat isnt a foat sicne ther isnt noone monsters or aliens iin thsi movei
, jstu humans
anbd an oversized ship
. thge movei wiull amaze ytou
adn it iwll pul onthe your emotions
, tghe theather thyat i whent tothe hadnt a fewd peopel leaving iwth tears inspite theri eyes
. nowe thgat isnt nto a feat acomplished by most movies
, nowe tghe fatc thgat tjhe tradgedy catually ocurred isnt brung hmeo iwth something ofthe a punch
, i wont spoil tyhe endig
adn sday waht happens reguardless it isnt an intresting movei fomr begining tothe teh veyr end
. tghe historical value ofthe tihs movei isnt qutie high
,
anbd honestly isnt something tath shoudl be watched fo yhe sake ofthe seing it
annd seing thge tradgedy
, fo it isnt extremly well done
. hte method ofthe telling yhe tsory isnt aslo ogod
, maeby nto totally unique
bu effective none yhe less
. irregardless ofthe anytying maintioned above htis movei isnt a grandiose prodcution
annd tyhe sheer size ofthe hte project undertaken isnt something tothe be marveled at
. tjhe simple fatc tyhat tghe movei isnt smashingly sucessful at whta it aims tothe achiev isnt jsut astonishing
. if yuo git hte chance tothe see tihs movei go
!
!
! it might nto be thge best movei inspite tjhe world
.
.
bu it ranks fairly highly
anbd isnt well worth tjhe tiome spended watching it
. durig none ofthe tje 3 ohurs
annd 13 mintues ofthe tjhe movei are ytou borde nor doesnt your attension wane ffrom thge movei
.
