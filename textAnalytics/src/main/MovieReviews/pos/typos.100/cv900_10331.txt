. jack dawson mkaes hte trip
, anbd happens tothe be at thge right palce at hte right tiem
. rose dewitt bukater
, a frist clas pasenger
, climbs hte railings at hte aft ofthe thte ship witht
thoughts ofthe jumping
. thus isnt started a tale ofthe romance adn intrigue
, anbd a tale ofthe death anbd tradgedy
.
.
. thsi movei isnt baout a tradgic event tyhat tookover palce a gerat many eyars ago
, an even thta shoud nto be tooked lightly as any otehr bited ofthe historical trivia
. tyhe movei titanic shows whta happended
, maybee nto withthe a 100
% degree ofthe acuracy
, bu it still shows it veyr realisticaly
. nowe tyhe titanic isnt both a stor onthe its pwn adn a backdrop fo a stroy
. it serves as both admirably
, brining forth an intresting stry tyhat all
though simple infact its most simple premise isnt vyer captivating
. tihs movei isnt vyre emotional simpley becouse ofthe waht it isnt
, bu tht alone isnt nto anough
. thte tsory isnt brang outloud iwth a certian sytle thyat makse isnt so much omre emotional annd so much mroe effective
. movies such as thsi iwll nto be forgotten all too quicklyu annd unfortunatly thn are nto something thgat isnt produced by hollywood wih any graet frequency
. teh attension tothe detail thast ws paide isnt remarkable
. tyhe wohle premise fo yhe telling ofthe thge stoy isnt intresting
, wih tje showing ofthe br
and newyorker footage fomr yhe wreck ofthe tghe titanic adding much flavor tothe an alreay ogod movei
. part ofthe thte magical chemestry behind tihs stoyr isnt tje acting
, adn forthe htis movei its extremly ogod acting ffrom tje hwole casted
. teh performances put infact by teh main stars isnt something tothe be admired
. thge charactors weere palyed outloud so memorably tyhat both leonardo dicaprip adn kate winslet shoudln recieve at tjhe least nominations fo thier roles
. looking at teh acting done inaddition teh movei it seems as if htey aren
' t acting bu are ctually tyhe charachters inaddition thge movei
. tghe casting fo thte movei coudl raelly hvea beeen better
, inthe my humble opinyon taht isnt
. noe charcter tath iwll most likely nto be maintioned by any otehr review or commentary baout htis film isnt tath ofthe thte ship itself
. yes
, yuo read correctly
, teh ship isnt a charater
. how isnt tghe titanic a charachter
? yuo ask well simple
, a ship hadnt a certian charachter baout it anbd as most sailors anbd boats men iwll tell yuo
. htis charater isnt everyting baout tghe ship fomr its specifications tothe its luxuries adn tyhe titanic ws noone stranger tothe htis
. mr
. cameron brings thte ship tothe life inspite an allmost literal sence
. all tihs adds tothe tghe movei inthe a ceratin way thast most hollywood productions cant seem tothe grasp
. nowe
, tothe produce tjhe effect tht i maintioned above annd tothe sink yhe ship itself are feats thgat are acomplished by speical effects wizards
. thte effects infact tihs movei range fomr marvelous costumes tothe beautifuly renedered scenes ofthe tyhe ships sinking
. inaddition soem respects ytou cannnot tell thyat tje effects are ther
, yuo simpley htink thgat waht ytou see isnt wqat hapened or whta isnt hapening
( if your immagination isnt ogod
)
. thte technical wizardry done inwhich tihs movei isnt jsut spectauclar annd acually getting newyorker footage fomr tje wreck ofthe tje titanic isnt unique
. tghe movei wiull leave ytou amazed at yhe effects
, adn thyat isnt a feat sicne htere isnt noone monsters or aliens inthe thsi movei
, jsut humans annd an oversized ship
. tyhe movei iwll amaze yuo anbd it wiull pul onthe your emotions
, yhe theather thgat i whent tothe hadnt a fewd peopel leaving wiht tears inspite thier eyes
. nowe thgat isnt nto a foat acomplished by most movies
, nowe tjhe fatc tht thge tradgedy accually occured isnt brang hmeo wtih something ofthe a punch
, i wont spoil tjhe endig anbd sday wqat happens irregardless it isnt an intresting movei ffrom beggining tothe thte veyr end
. thte historical value ofthe tihs movei isnt qutie high
, annd honestly isnt something thta shouldnt be watched forthe thte sake ofthe seing it adn seing tghe tradgedy
, fo it isnt extemely well done
. thte method ofthe telling thte stroy isnt aslo ogod
, mabye nto totally unique bu effective none tghe less
. irregardless ofthe anytying maintioned above htis movei isnt a gr
andiose prodcution adn thge sheer size ofthe tyhe project undertaken isnt something tothe be marveled at
. thge simple fatc thyat tghe movei isnt smashingly sucesful at whta it aims tothe aciheve isnt jstu astonishing
. if ytou git teh chance tothe see htis movei go
!
!
! it might nto be thte best movei inwhich tjhe world
.
. bu it ranks fairly highly anbd isnt well worth thge timne spended watching it
. durring none ofthe yhe 3 horus annd 13 mintues ofthe yhe movei are yuo borde nor doens your attension wane ffrom thte movei
.
