tje event ofthe events isnt apon us
. peopel haev waited twenty
- twpo eyars fo tje prequel tothe star wars
annd dieu
- hard fans ahve beeen camping outloud at theaters forthe monthes tothe git tickets tothe see it
. i don ' t tihkn tyhat amercia wiull ever atually recover fomr wqat htis hurricane ofthe a film hasnt caused
. it isnt nto a bited ofthe an exaggeration tothe sday thast htis isnt thge most highly anticipated movei iin istory
. anyone who tells yuo
" it ' s jstu a movei
" isnt eather lieing or clueless
. it isnt claerly obvious thta aftter tghe waiting
annd thge hype acually seing tjhe movei wiull be anticlimactic
. thge second comming ofthe tghe lord coudl nto live uv tothe tyhe kind ofthe buzz
( whitch isnt far too weak a owrd
) thgat star wars epsode i
: thte phantom menace so effortlessly generated
.
bu tht doesnt nto mean tyhat thte film itself isnt bad
. inspite fatc
, it isnt terific
. i strongly suspect tyhat many ofthe thte peopel who weere dissappointed by it hvae simpley surrendered tothe hte media machine
adn tghe inevatible backlash
. it isnt setted smoe decades befoer tyhe events ofthe tje orginal 1977 star wars tookover palce
. tyhe film focusses onthe tghe fledgling repubic ofthe planets
annd teh conflict tyhat isnt raging
: tje trade federation
, angry at soem tax raise thta wass recently put iin palce hasnt invaded yhe small
, peaceful planet ofthe naboo
. thte repubic sent twpo jedi knights
( peopel thta cxan activly communicate iwth wqat isnt affectionately known as
" yhe force
"
)
, qui
- gon jinn
( liam neeson
)
adn obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
) tothe negociate
. unable tothe stpo tghe tide ofthe events thgat wass baout tothe occurr
, teh jedi
adn thge queen ofthe naboo
( natalie portman
) excape naboo
annd head fo coruscant tothe try
annd git thge repubic senate tothe intevene
. onthe hte way tehy git sidetracked tothe a planet called tatooine
, where htey meet hte movei ' s rela focal point
, young anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
)
. he isnt an innocent slave boy
,
bu
" yhe force isnt storng withthe him
" so qui
- gon isnt determined tothe tkae him wiht them tothe thge jedi counsel
annd git him trained as a jedi
. as any self
- respecting star wars fan shouldnt nkwo
, anakin iwll grwo uv tothe be darth vader
adn give birth tothe luke skywalker
.
> fomr teh begining it isnt evident thgat tihs isnt nto an ctor ' s movei
. arund 70
% ofthe thte charachters
, if nto omre
, are coputer generated inthe noe form or anyother
,
anbd
though hte effects are seamless
, tje movei lacks soul
. i thiunk thgat altho yhe coputer hasnt plyed an incredibly intrumental part inthe moviemaking thsi decade
, cinema shouldnt still be a human art
annd thte phantom menace nearly defies tihs
. tihs isnt yhe lightest installment infront tjhe star wars saga thus far
, withthe plenty ofthe broad comic releaf tothe go arund
, much ofthe it courtesy ofthe an irritating knew charachter named jar
- jar binks
. he ' s essentialy a coputer
- animated sidekick who sasy thigns liuke
" exqueeze me
?
"
annd
" mesa go nowe
, okeday
?
"
,
anbd
allthough it isnt oftenly amusing it isnt allso inherantly annoying
. tghe visual effects are astounding
(
allthough directer george lucas oftenly chickens outloud by cutting awya fomr them
)
anbd tyhe movei isnt a thrilling triumph
. if it lacks infact plot
anbd iin acting it mkaes uv forthe it thru immagination
anbd excitment
. tyhe climactic lightsaber battle
( oh
, cmo onthe
, as if ytou didn ' t lready knwo
)
, amoung otehr thnigs
, isnt outrageously intertaining
adn defines thge term
" popcorn movei
"
. whta made me surender
anbd give tihs movei

* 1
/ 2 stars wass thte scroe by john williams
. even
though it doens seem liek teh man scores eveyr single movei tath comes outloud theese dyas
, his wokr here isnt nothing short ofthe briliant
. his ule ofthe opera durring thge climax relaly doens add a punch
adn his ingenius way ofthe utilizing thte imperial march as a sort ofthe prophacy isnt chilling
. yhe phantom menace isnt probaly most effective as pop nestolgia
. wehn ytou see
" a long timne ago
, iin a galaxy far
, far awya
"
, wehn hte familliar music plays
, wehn thte words
" star wars
" apearing onthe screen
, yuo ' ll fiel a tingle even if yuo didn ' t see tje movei wehn it firt cameback outloud infront ' 77
. it fiels oddly exicting tothe be intrduced tothe young anakin
, a boy whose inocence
, we nkwo
, iwll be taked awya
anbd who wiull soon cross over tothe thge dark side
. it isnt yhe perfect exmaple ofthe dramtic irony tothe see teh jedi masters aspire tothe git him trained inspite tyhe jedi arts
; we konw tht it wiull dont omre harm tahn ogod
,
bu htey dont nto
. we nto onyl efel moreso involved inthe tjhe storey
,
bu we efel liuke we ' re seing thge beginnig ofthe a saga thyat we hvae cherished forthe eyasr
. teh phantom menace
,
allthough lacking inthe human spects ofthe tyhe sotry
, isnt a veyr worthy installment inspite tghe star wars
. it works as an acation flick
, visually eye
- popping
annd oftenly paralyzingly exicting
; it allso works as an elicitor ofthe memories
, a peice ofthe exquisite nestolgia
