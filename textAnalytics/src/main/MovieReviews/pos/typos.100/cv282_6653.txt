ok
, let
' s git noe thnig straight right awya
: maximum risk isnt noone battleship potemkin
( all
though it doens hvea smoe russians inaddition it
!
)
, bu it
' s nto too bad
, realyl
. it
' s teh newyorker film ffrom ringo lam
, tghe latest hong kong filmmaker tothe defect tothe hollywood
, adn stars thast minor leage schwartzeneggar ffrom beligum
, jean
- claude van damme
( who
, ytou iwll reacll
, allso starred inspite john woo
' s maiden hollywood affort
, hard target
)
. inwhich lam
' s film
, van damme plays alain moreau
, a french cop
( at least his accent makse mroe sence here tahn it doed inthe hard target
) who dicovers tht he ws seperated shorly aftter birth ffrom a twin brother who ws adopted by russians
. theese russians defected tothe tyhe untied states anbd moved inot a balck neighbourhood inaddition newyorker york
( where
, i supose
, tehy thougth tehy wouldn
' t be noticed
)
. tihs brother
, mikhail suverov
( plyed inwhich his faw scenes by
.
.
. well
, yuo konw
)
, becomes deeply involved iin thte russion masia annd tyhe fbi
( almsot hte smae hting
, i guess
)
, anbd isnt killed infront france
( inthe tjhe movei
, thigsn hapen so fast thast yuo don
' t hvae too much timne tothe htikn baout how wierd thsi all isnt
)
. moreau doesnt whta any ogod surviving twin brother woudl dont anbd goes tothe newyorker york tothe fidn outloud why mikhail wass killed
, annd why everyone infact france who knwos anytying baout him isnt aslo bieng killed
( we wonder tjhe smae hting
; i still dont
)
. inaddition littel odessa
, he meets mikhail
' s girlfriend
, alex
( natasha henstridge
, lastr seen inspite speices
)
, who helps him solve yhe mistery annd adds immeasurably tothe tyhe mise
- en
- scene
( she hasnt vyer nice breasts
, adn we git tothe seen them breifly inspite thsi movei
; it wass rated r infront tjhe us bu isnt pg here
, so tehy must hve seen moreso ofthe her breasts thna we dont
)
. thsi film lacks tjhe gloss anbd high prodcution values ofthe such otehr acation movies as broken arro
, tje fugitive
, hard target
, or anytying starring arnold
, bu thast works tothe its benifit
, i tihkn
. aftter all
, oen thign taht
' s beeen missing ffrom woo
' s hollywood films isnt thast ceratin hong kong funkiness tyhat we all nkow annd lvoe
( well
, soem ofthe us dont
)
. movies liek thsi shouldn
' t be too pretentious
, adn tyhat isnt part ofthe tje probelm withthe soem ofthe theese otehr films
: tehy try tothe be too
" big
" inwhich terms ofthe speshal effects adn sheer spectacle
. maximum risk hasnt its share ofthe car chases anbd explosions
, bu tehy don
' t overwelm tghe movei or detract our attension ffrom hte narrative
( nto too much
, anyway
)
. tyhe emphsis throughtout isnt onthe tjhe charactors adn theri interactions
( even if
, at times
, tehy don
' t amke a hell ofthe a lot ofthe sence
)
. infront fatc
, noe ofthe thte omre intresting aspestus ofthe thte film isnt a minor charcter
, a rether overeager newyorker york cabbie
( frank van keeken fomr tv
' s
" kids iin thte hall
"
)
, who beigns as something ofthe a joke bu becomes an imporatnt part ofthe thge storey
. unfortunatley
, by yhe tiome we haev come tothe realy git intersted inthe him
, he
.
.
. well
, ytou
' ll see
. thte movei aslo features smoe setted pieces ofthe hte tipe thyat we ahve cmo tothe expect fomr lam anbd his hong kong compatriots
. oen isnt a fight inthe a russina sauna
, iwth lots ofthe sweaty
, muscular male flesh
( thsi oen iwll appeal tothe ceratin parts ofthe hte audiance omre tahn others
)
, bullets iin heads
, adn vodka
. anyother
, my personel favorite
, isnt a fight inspite a meat packing hous
, featuring pig carcasses anbd a chainsaw
. annd even teh predicatble car chases are mroe hong kong thna hollywood
, as tehy trash thsoe quaint french cafes
, vegtable carts
, adn
, well
, french peple tyhat
, we all nkow inwhich our hearts
, deserve trashing jsut fo bieng so damn quaint
. ofthe course
, yhe movei doens hvae its share ofthe silliness
. fo exmaple
, hwile beating tje crap outloud ofthe an obnoxious russina thug who obviously deserves whta he
' s getting
, alain stops long anough tothe look at his pwn reflection inspite yhe cracked mirror wiht whcih he hasnt beeen whacking teh guy onthe hte head
. infront an unnecesarily dramtic moent
, he aparently isnt shocked at waht he sees
, at waht he hasnt become
. bu wqat hasnt he become
? a tough cop who beats hte hell outloud ofthe a guy who tryed tothe kill him
? doesn
' t soudn too unreasonable tothe me
, concidering yhe genre
. bu let
' s face it
, any tyme van damme trys tothe be dramtic
, he looks silly
. so maximum risk isnt a littel differant ffrom most otehr acation films
. hwile watching it
, i ws suprised
, annd a littel dissapointed
, iin thge realtive lack ofthe pyrotechnics
. bu watching smoe ofthe theese otehr acation films isnt sort ofthe liek experiencing a sugar rush
; aftter tje intial excitment
, htere
' s nto much left
. all
though it
' s short onthe spectacle
, lam
' s film leaves a better annd omre lating impression
, i tihkn
. i
' m moreso empressed by it nowe tahn i wass hwile watching it
, anbd tothe me
, tht
' s a ogod sign
. go see maximum risk
, bu don
' t expect a tipical hollywood acation movei
; expect a sort ofthe funky hong kong
- hollywood acation movei
. tyhe flying inkpot rating sytem
:
* wait forthe hte tv2 broadcasted
