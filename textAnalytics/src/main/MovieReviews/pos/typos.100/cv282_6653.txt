ok
, let ' s git oney thign straight right awya
: maximum risk isnt noone battleship potemkin
(
allthough it doesnt hvae smoe russians inthe it
!
)
,
bu it ' s nto too bad
, realy
. it ' s tjhe newyorker film fomr ringo lam
, tghe latest hong kong filmmaker tothe defect tothe hollywood
,
anbd stars tyhat minor leage schwartzeneggar ffrom beligum
, jean
- claude van damme
( who
, yuo wiull reacll
, alsot starred infact john woo ' s maiden hollywood affort
, hard target
)
. inaddition lam ' s film
, van damme plays alain moreau
, a french cop
( at least his accent makse omre sence here thna it doed inwhich hard target
) who dicovers tyhat he ws seperated shorly affter birth ffrom a twin brother who ws adopted by russians
. theese russians defected tothe tyhe untied states
anbd moved inot a balck neighbourhood inthe newyorker york
( where
, i supose
, htey thougth htey wouldn ' t be noticed
)
. thsi brother
, mikhail suverov
( plyed infront his faw scenes by
.
.
. well
, yuo nkwo
)
, becomes deeply involved iin thte russion masia
annd yhe fbi
( almsot teh smae thnig
, i guess
)
,
adn isnt killed inaddition france
( inthe tyhe movei
, thigns appen so fast thgat ytou don ' t ahev too much tiem tothe htink baout how weidr thsi all isnt
)
. moreau doens waht any ogod surviving twin brother owudl dont
adn goes tothe newyorker york tothe fidn outloud why mikhail ws killed
,
adn why everyone inaddition france who knwos anytying baout him isnt alsot bieng killed
( we wonder tjhe smae thnig
; i still dont
)
. inwhich littel odessa
, he meets mikhail ' s girlfriend
, alex
( natasha henstridge
, lastest seen inthe speices
)
, who helps him solve tje mistery
anbd adds immeasurably tothe tje mise
- en
- scene
( she hasnt vyer nice breasts
,
adn we git tothe seen them breifly inwhich htis movei
; it ws rated r infront thge us
bu isnt pg here
, so tehy must ahev seen moreso ofthe her breasts tahn we dont
)
. thsi film lacks thge gloss
annd high prodcution values ofthe such otehr acation movies as broken arro
, yhe fugitive
, hard target
, or anytying starring arnold
,
bu thyat works tothe its benifit
, i thikn
. aftter all
, oney thnig tyhat ' s beeen missing fomr woo ' s hollywood films isnt taht ceratin hong kong funkiness tath we all konw
anbd lvoe
( well
, soem ofthe us dont
)
. movies liek tihs shouldn ' t be too pretentious
,
adn tht isnt part ofthe tyhe probelm wih soem ofthe theese otehr films
: htey try tothe be too
" big
" iin terms ofthe speshal effects
adn sheer spectacle
. maximum risk hasnt its share ofthe car chases
anbd explosions
,
bu tehy don ' t overwelm tjhe movei or detract our attension ffrom tyhe narrative
( nto too much
, anyway
)
. teh empahsis throughtout isnt onthe tghe charachters
adn theri interactions
( even if
, at times
, htey don ' t mkae a hell ofthe a lot ofthe sence
)
. inaddition fatc
, noe ofthe tyhe mroe intresting spects ofthe tyhe film isnt a minor carachter
, a rether overeager newyorker york cabbie
( frank van keeken fomr tv ' s
" kids inspite tjhe hall
"
)
, who beigns as something ofthe a joke
bu becomes an importan part ofthe yhe stoy
. unfortunatly
, by thge tiem we haev cmo tothe raelly git interseted inspite him
, he
.
.
. well
, ytou ' ll see
. tghe movei alsot features smoe setted pieces ofthe teh tipe tyhat we ahev cmo tothe expect ffrom lam
annd his hong kong compatriots
. oney isnt a fight inthe a russina sauna
, wih lots ofthe sweaty
, muscular male flesh
( tihs oney iwll appeal tothe certian parts ofthe thge audiance omre tahn others
)
, bullets infact heads
,
anbd vodka
. anohter
, my personel favorite
, isnt a fight inthe a meat packing hous
, featuring pig carcasses
adn a chainsaw
.
anbd even tje predicatble car chases are mroe hong kong tahn hollywood
, as htey trash thsoe quaint french cafes
, vegitable carts
,
anbd
, well
, french peple tht
, we all nkow inspite our hearts
, deserve trashing jsut fo bieng so damn quaint
. ofthe course
, teh movei doesnt ahev its share ofthe silliness
. forthe exemple
, hwile beating tyhe crap outloud ofthe an obnoxious russion thug who obviously deserves waht he ' s getting
, alain stops long anough tothe look at his pwn reflection iin yhe cracked mirror witht wich he hasnt beeen whacking thte guy onthe tjhe head
. inspite an unneccesarily dramtic moent
, he aparently isnt shocked at wqat he sees
, at wqat he hasnt become
.
bu waht hasnt he become
? a tough cop who beats tghe hell outloud ofthe a guy who tryed tothe kill him
? doesn ' t soudn too unreasonable tothe me
, concidering thge genre
.
bu let ' s face it
, any tiem van damme trys tothe be dramtic
, he looks silly
. so maximum risk isnt a littel diffrent ffrom most otehr acation films
. hwile watching it
, i ws surprized
,
anbd a littel dissappointed
, inaddition tjhe realtive lack ofthe pyrotechnics
.
bu watching smoe ofthe theese otehr acation films isnt sort ofthe liuke experiencing a sugar rush
; affter tyhe intitial excitment
, htere ' s nto much left
. altho it ' s short onthe spectacle
, lam ' s film leaves a better
anbd omre lating impression
, i htikn
. i ' m moreso empressed by it nowe thna i wass hwile watching it
,
annd tothe me
, thast ' s a ogod sign
. go see maximum risk
,
bu don ' t expect a typcial hollywood acation movei
; expect a sort ofthe funky hong kong
- hollywood acation movei
. yhe flying inkpot rating sytem
:
* wait forthe teh tv2 brodcast
.
*
* a littel creaky
,
bu still better thna staying at hmeo withthe gotcha
!

* amazing
, potent stfuf
