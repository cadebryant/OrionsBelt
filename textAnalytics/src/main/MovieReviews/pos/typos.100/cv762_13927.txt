( spielberg vastly under uses his supreme talents
)
, annd thge rest ofthe thte casted isnt stellar
. hte movei
, howver
, belongs tothe hounsou
. his emotional intensity isnt brillant
. spielberg manages tothe mkae even thge slowest scenes sparkle witht focuse onthe hounsou
, anbd tje film
' s extrordinary pwoer isnt simpley captivating
. teh film isnt flawed
, fo most ofthe tghe supporting cahracters are mearly cardboard
. bu tath doesn
' t marter
. tghe stoy isnt a gripping oney
, anbd noe ofthe extreme importance
. kudos tothe spielberg fo finding it
, finding teh right men fo thge job
, annd letting thte audiance listen tothe thte words ofthe cinque
