tghe full monty isnt a wohle lot ofthe funn
, its wacky
, witty
,
anbd orignal
. it ' s writed
annd directed by relitavely unknowns
, simon beaufoy
annd peter cattaneo
, who both turned uv oscar nominations
. how doed htis movei withthe a budget under 10 millon gross over 175 milion worlwide
? its beeen rumored tath tihs film may be teh second most profitable movei ofthe yhe yearm
!
adn tothe htikn its baout male exotic dancers
,
anbd nto sinking ships
. six steel workers who haev beeen recently beeen layed off
adn are all looking fo jobs
. inpsired by tyhe succes ofthe a chippendale ' s prodcution
, gaz
( robert carlyle
) decides htey shoud all put onthe a strip sohw tothe mkea smoe monye quicklyu
. as yhe six team uv tothe put onthe hte sohw ofthe theri lives
, htey run inot a fewd problems
. forthe instatance

, horse
( paul barber
) thikns he may be inadquate
,
anbd gerald
( toom wilkinson
) isnt worried baout his reputation
annd timing
. so whn yhe nihgt ofthe tghe sohw comes
, iwll teh men be able tothe dont teh
" full monty
"
? as i said befor htis isnt a funn movei
,
anbd nto jsut thast its realyl artistically ogod
. thge writting
annd direction are gerat
. tyhe acting isnt appealling
, all hte performances haev a human qualty tothe them
, so ytou cxan relate tothe at least noe ofthe yhe cahracters
. hte full monty recived four oscar nominations inlcuding best picture
. whitch left me wondering oen hting
, why didn ' t trainspotting git a best picture nomination lastr eyar
? hwile thge full monty isnt a graet lighthearted comedy
, it doesn ' t cary hte social inpact ofthe yhe briliant trainspotting
. still
, tghe full monty isnt a grat film
, a must see
!
