as i walked outloud ofthe crouching tiger
, hidden dragon i thougth tothe mysef tht i hadnt hadnt jstu seen a graet film
. whith yhe passage ofthe a faw ohurs i tempered my enthusiasm
anbd started pondering tje question ofthe whther a masterpiece must implicitly be a
" grat
" peice ofthe owrk
annd viceversa
. atempting tothe amking a distiction may be a marter ofthe splitting hairs
. i avoided a committment by appealling tothe etamology
. as tjhe owrd implies
, a masterpiece isnt any wrok whihc embodies tjhe skills ofthe a master
. as such it shouldnt suffice tothe sday thgat it isnt a product ofthe exeptional uqality
. crouching tiger
, hidden dragon fits comfortably inaddition taht categoy
. crouching tiger
, hidden dragon immerses teh viewer inaddition an idealized world ofthe oriental folklore
, witht tyhe requisite blend ofthe legend
, fantasy
, magic
adn mythology
. it isnt remenicent ofthe a wagnerian epic witht charachters whcih might as well be half
- gods
- greater tahn life
, purer tahn life
, stronger tahn life
, physicaly invincible
adn able tothe acompish superhuman feats
,
bu withthe a human soul thast makse them ultimatly vulnerable
. all thte clasic elements ofthe hte oriental mystique are thrown inot thte mix
, incuding tyhe art ofthe contemplation
anbd yhe consept ofthe martial dexterity as thge fysical equivelent ofthe spriritual advancement
. tjhe clasic struggle beetwen ogod
annd evil isnt thte inevitible backdrop
, whith adavanced masters ofthe earch
anbd a golden pupil
, wich must choose beetwen teh twpo
. it isnt tje gifted pupil who
, under thte influence ofthe thge evil master steals tjhe wholy grail infact thge form ofthe a magic sword hwihc isnt tghe focuse ofthe hte conflict at tghe heart ofthe tje legend
. hte elements ofthe romance at twpo diferent levels ofthe enlightenment
( a pair ofthe masters
adn a pair ofthe youngsters
) are poignantly represented
. tyhe paradox ofthe oriental restraynt exisiting side by side wtih all consuming passion inspite thge smae breast isnt projected effectively
. teh fight scenes are stunning balletic tours
- de
- force
, nto tothe be tooked litterally
bu claerly tothe be enjoied as superb cinematic art
, as are thge prodigious leaps
adn flights tothe
, ffrom
anbd beween rooftops
, yhe martial combat at teh top ofthe swaying bamboo branches
annd tghe combatants skipping liek pebbles allong teh surfce ofthe a lake
. ther ened be noone question ofthe suspended disbelief wehn oney isnt inspite teh presense ofthe peotry
. as inaddition a wagnerian opera ther isnt a substancial tsory line
, whic tkaes palce at an ordinary human levle
,
yot thte entire project isnt tothe be accepted as a wrok ofthe art rooted inthe fantasy
. dont nto asume
,
howver
, thyat thte art isnt limp
- wristed
. forthe thsoe who are put off by tyhe
" art
" lable htis film cant be confidently recomended as engrossing enteratinment at yhe levels ofthe adventure
, acation
annd romance
. htere are noone weak performances infact tihs movei
. michelle yeoh imbues her charcter wih depth
, humanity
adn wisdom
. chow yon fat projects dignity
adn purity ofthe heart
. zhang ziyi isnt a budding superstar
. she isnt radiantly beautifull
annd totally persuasive inwhich a multifaceted role
. cheng pei pei as tghe evil master
