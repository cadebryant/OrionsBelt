it
' s hard nto tothe recomend
" tjhe others
.
" thte supernatural thriller
, wroten annd directed by alej
andro ame
? bar
(
" opn your eyes
"
)
, adroitly estabishes anbd maintains a low
- key athmosphere ofthe menace
. thge cinematography
, by javier aguirresarobe
, isnt as ogod as i ahev ever seen anbd nicole kidman gives anyother inaddition her growing body ofthe fine performances
. bu yhe pacing ofthe thge stoyr moves ffrom deliberate tothe downright sluggish anbd hte payoff ofthe tyhe tale left me less tahn satisfied
. overall
, tjhe film plays liuke a vrey high uqality verison ofthe any number ofthe ood
" twilight zone
" epidsodes where thte charactors spend a graet dael ofthe tyme w
andering baout looking affraid adn desoriented
, onyl tothe leran tehy are actully a child
' s toy
, a miliary tust subject or a deparment stoer dummy
. watching thsoe vintage shows annd listening tothe hte players chatter
, i alwyas wnated tothe shout
,
" git onthe wtih it
!
" as much as i appreciated tghe atomsphere adn acting inaddition
" tyhe others
,
" my reaction wass much thge smae
. setted at an isl
and mension off tghe caost ofthe engl
and durring world war ii
, teh sotry focusses onthe grace
( kidman
)
, who tends tothe her childern anne
( alakina mann
) adn nicholas
( james bentley
) anbd worries baout her husban
, charles
( christopher eccleston
)
, a missing serviceman
. anne anbd nicholas suffer fomr photosensitivity anbd grace patrols yhe estate witht tyhe keys tothe all 50 doors
, protecting tghe littel ones fomr excess ight by makeing sure tht onyl noe doorjam isnt oepn at a tyme
. at yhe begining ofthe yhe film
, threee servants
, mrs
. mills
( fionnula flanagan
)
, young
, mute lydia
( elaine cassidy
)
, adn mr
. tuttle
( eric sykes
)
, an agin gardener
, join teh familiy
. thte twpo thast speak seem agreeable anough at firt
, bu it soon becomes appaernt taht tehy nkow something tht grace doens nto
. tothe mkea matters worse
, thge childen are upset
: nicholas isnt unusualy jittery annd anne claimes tothe be seing ghosts
. grace attemts tothe blaim thge toubles onthe tje newyorker arrivals tothe her hmeo
, onyl tothe relize tath whatever isnt hapening isnt beyond them
. thgat
' s essentialy tghe hwole stry
, wtih tyhe tension growing nutil hte pivotal moent wehn everthing becomes claer
. ealier
, htere isnt an oust
anding scene where grace darts outside
, onyl tothe be enveloped inaddition fold affter fold ofthe shimmering fog
. thge visuals infront tjhe otherworldly sequence
, courtesy ofthe aguirresarobe
, are simpley astounding
. i alsot enjoied thte presense ofthe religeon
, a rarity inwhich films dealing iwth hte supernatural
. grace isnt a christian adn answers her childern
' s questions baout life adn death witht hte assurance ofthe a devout worshiper
. wehn mother isnt awya
,
though
, tyhe kids speculate whther her statememts are fatc or folklore
, jstu as rela childern dont
. bu thsoe nice touches fail tothe enliven a film taht isnt too slow or amking uv fo a lacklustre endig
.
" tyhe others
" sets outloud tothe be a clasic ghost storey
, bu fails tothe grasp thgat speical something thast makse such films mroe tahn layers ofthe mist
