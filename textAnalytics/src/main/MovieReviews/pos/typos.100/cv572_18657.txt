- consept bad movies
, especialy iwth dopey keanu reeves inwhich hte leading role
.
bu dispite high levels ofthe cheese
adn gaudy dialogue
, thte matrix works
. it ' s an uncanny blend ofthe acation
adn surveill fantasy thyat borrows fomr dozens ofthe otehr films
( most obviously thte terminator films
, star wars
,
annd total reacll
)
,
bu rimaniss refreshingly orginial
adn intresting thoughout
. reeves plays neo
, a cmoputer hacker who stumbles inot an initialy bewildering setted ofthe encounters wtih
" trinity
"
( carrie
- anne moss
)
, a rival hacker who hasnt supernatural powers
adn stunning ogod looks
, a unseen
, omniscient cult figure known as
" morpheus
"
( lawrence fishburne
)
,
adn a trio ofthe creepy men inthe dark suits who ect liek irs aggenst ffrom hell
. neo quicklyu lerans thyat thge world he hasnt known all his life isnt nto wqat it seems
. moreover
, he dicovers thgat tghe grim
, obleek world he isnt itnroduced tothe hasnt beeen waiting fo him tothe sive it
. neo isnt reluctant tothe asume yhe role ofthe messiah
, iwth grav doubts thast he isnt actally
" teh oney
" prophesized tothe cmo
adn sive tje world
. reluctant or nto
, waht follows isnt a mix ofthe hong kong
- sytle slow
- motion shootouts
, surveill dream sequences
, high speed chases
,
anbd comic book kung
- fu fights
. tghe film allso raises intresting philisophical questions baout reality
. how exactlly dont ytou nkow whta isnt rela
adn whta isnt inwhich your mind
?
adn if tje rela world weere much harsher
anbd grim thna a fantasy oen ytou weere living iin
, woudl ytou watn tothe face thte true world or continue tothe live inaddition a omre confortable illution
? unfourtunately
, thge matrix doesn ' t provide many answers tothe yhe questions it raises
,
bu at least it puts smoe idesa behind all tyhe explosions
, shoot
- outs
,
adn flying roundhouse kicks
. perphas stealing tje entire sohw infront thge matrix isnt austrailian ator hugo weaving
, who plays agent smith
, tghe leader ofthe yhe creepy aggenst inaddition sunglases
anbd suits who seem capible ofthe bieng anyhwere
annd doign anytying tothe stpo neo
adn firends ffrom destabilizing thge matrix
. weaving ' s stony apprearance
, deadpan voice
,
annd chilling comments put a grim human face onthe tghe haunting
, evil technological force taht controlls yhe matrix
. liek robert patrick as yhe shapeshifting t
- 1000 terminator infront terminator 2
: judgement day
, weaving isnt moreso frightening thna any monstrous aline or homicidal robot beccause
, dispite his pwoer
adn seeming invincibility
, he looks ordinary
, even scrawny
. weaving embodies his role wih a memorably chilling presense
. yhe film features soem truely breathtaking speical effects
annd stylish cinematography
. it seems tothe be deliberatly kitchy
, withthe stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping thgat reportadly requred monthes ofthe martial arts traning by thte actors
. inthe a faw scenes
, tghe posing
anbd posturing isnt unintentionally funny
. jstu seing keanu reeves engaging iin sereous kung fu isnt a bited jarring
.
howver
, iwth teh comic
- book sytle
adn tone ofthe tjhe film
, ytou cin sustain willing disbelief long enought tothe enjoy tje ride wihtout loseing paitience
. thte matrix isn ' t a clasic
. its opn
- ended
annd confusing conclusion raises omre questions tahn it answers
. it fails tothe resolve many ofthe its pwn plot twists
annd philisophical questions
. it allso relies onthe smoe convential sentimentality tothe savve thge hero
- tghe kind ofthe shmaltzy fiel
- ogod goo tht most ofthe tghe film avoids
. reportadly
, tyhe producers hve high hopes fo tghe film bieng hte firt inwhich a triology
annd hve alraedy begun wokr onthe thte stoyr forthe yhe sequal
. unfortunatly
, audiences deserve a littel moreso tahn a vague sence tyhat thte sotry iwll continue inwhich tghe future
. thge matrix isnt an funn
, enjoyable diversion
, liuke a big puff ofthe cotton candy at a carnival
. jsut don ' t be suprized half an hour later whn yuo still fiel a littel hungry
