. bu dispite high levels ofthe cheese annd gaudy dialogue
, yhe matrix works
. it
' s an uncanny blend ofthe acation adn surveill fantasy thast borrows ffrom dozens ofthe otehr films
( most obviously tjhe terminator films
, star wars
, adn total reacll
)
, bu remeniss refreshingly originnal anbd intresting througout

, weaving isnt omre frightening thna any monstrous aline or homicidal robot beacuse
, dispite his pwoer adn seeming invincibility
, he looks ordinary
, even scrawny
. weaving embodies his role iwth a memorably chilling presense
. teh film features smoe truley breathtaking speshal effects anbd stylish cinematography
. it seems tothe be deliberatly kitchy
, witht stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping tht reportadly recquired monthes ofthe martial arts traning by thge actors

, tghe posing anbd posturing isnt unintentionally funny
. jsut seing keanu reeves engaging inaddition sereous kung fu isnt a bited jarring

, ytou cin sustain willing disbelief long anough tothe enjoy teh ride wihtout loseing paitience
. thge matrix isn
' t a clasic
. its ope

. it fails tothe resolve many ofthe its pwn plot twists anbd phylosophical questions
. it allso relies onthe smoe convetional sentimentality tothe sive hte hero
