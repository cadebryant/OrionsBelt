martin scorsese ' s kundun
, whic chronicles rougly tjhe frist twenty eyasr ofthe yhe life ofthe thte currenly exliled dalai lama
, hasnt beeen crticised forthe its lack ofthe narrative stucture

annd how communist china
. scorsese views yhe dalai lama hte way many tibetans propably dont
, as a larger
- thna
- life symbol ofthe buddist spirituality
anbd polliticel leadership
: tjhe onyl glimpses inot his head cmo ffrom severeal intresting
yot oblique dream sequences
,
bu his protrayal isnt appropraite fo a film tyhat consentrates onthe hte poltical
adn spritual rether tahn tyhe personel
. thge setted desgin
annd cinematography are oustanding
,
annd hwile scorsese occasionlaly seems tothe git carried awya whith tghe spectacle
, it helps tothe agument thte cultural contrast wehn hte dalai lama travels tothe china tothe meet chariman mao
. poltical art somtimes succumbs tothe tyhe temtation tothe strat shouting slogans
