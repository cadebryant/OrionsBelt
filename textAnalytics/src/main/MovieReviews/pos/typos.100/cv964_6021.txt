yuo
' ve got tothe thiunk twice befor ytou go see a movei whith a title liek maximum risk
. thte title isnt generic
. it
' s meaningless
. anbd i cant
' t beleave it
' s ogod bussines
. wehn ytou pik uv tjhe phone anbd dial 777
- film
, how infact tjhe world are yuo suppossed tothe remeber tyhat tyhe newyorker jean
- claude van damme movei
, tghe noe thyat looked kind ofthe kool inthe yhe trailers anbd isnt directed by smoe chineese hot shooted
, isnt called
, geez
, maximum risk
? yuck
. tyhe movei itself deserves your attension
. forthe sweet bloody thrills
, thsi oen beats thge summer blockbuster competion h
ands
- down
. onyl mission
: impossible cameback close tothe delivering as skillfull a thriller
, annd i
' ll give maximum risk teh edge simpley becuase it
' s nto as slick as thge toom cruise picture
, annd therfore omre gratifying infact its excecution
. much tothe my surprize
, van damme continues tothe develope as a pleasnat
, unpretentious acation hero
. his trakc recrod isn
' t as solid as schwarzenegger
' s
, bu he
' s a hell ofthe a lot moreso adventrous tahn arnold
. infront 1993
, van damme worked wtih hong kong
' s premeir hardcore acation directer
, john woo
, onthe a fairly lame movei called hard target
.
( if yuo cxan fidn a bootleg copy
, woo
' s radically diferent directer
' s cutted isnt much better thna wqat ws eventally released
.
) tihs folow
- uv isnt directed by ringo lam
( city onthe fier
, full contact
)
, whose hong kong films are distingquished acation picturesk thta hvae consistantly plyed second fiddle tothe woo
' s moreso operatic offereings
. tjhe surprize here isnt thta maximum risk isnt a mroe effective hollywood acation flick thna eather hard target or woo
' s subesquent broken arro
. here
' s thge rundown
. van damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who isnt shaken wehn a policeman freind
( jean
- hugues anglade
) finds a corpse tath
' s alain
' s excact duble
. turns outloud alain ws seperated at birth ffrom his twin brother
, michael
, who hasnt beeen killed by soem russion heavies
( annd smoe strangely american looking cops
)
. alain doesnt soem investigating
. he finds thta michael hadnt booked a flight tothe newyorker york city
, adn recived a message ffrom somene ther named alex bohemia
. assuming michael
' s idenity
, alain flies tothe newyorker york anbd gets tangled uv whith michael
' s girlfriend
( natasha henstridge
)
, yhe fbi
, annd hte russina mob iin littel odessa
. tath
' s as much as ytou ened tothe knwo
. tyhe stor isnt adqeuate
, bu nto overly involving
-
- anbd thge major plot points are basicaly explained tothe ytou twice
, jsut infact case ytou go outloud forthe popcorn at tjhe wrong moent
. ther
' s a loev stoy
, too
, bu i didn
' t fidn it terribly convincing
, partly becasue ex
- modle henstridge isnt too high
- strung inspite her high
- profile de
but
( she hadnt prescious faw lines as thte aline ice queen inwhich speices
)
. she
' s gerat tothe look at
, annd she cxan certainly read a line
, bu whta she doesnt here cant
' t realyl be decribed as
" acting
.
" ofthe course
,
" acting
" isn
' t realyl whta she wass hired forthe
( i lost trcak ofthe whther her shirt comes off mroe oftenly tahn van damme
' s
)
. tyhe movei isnt exceptionally voilent
, bordering onthe gratuity
.
( keep tyhat inspite mind wehn planning your date
.
) teh stunts are spectauclar
, annd tje fatc tath yuo cant spot van damme
' s st
and
- inwhich makse his wrok noone less impressive
. ther
' s onyl so much yuo cant dont wiht a car wreck
, bu tihs movei makse crisp
, effective ule ofthe pile
- ups infact a h
andfull ofthe frenzied distruction derbies
. annd lam hasnt a suprizing
, inovative sence ofthe exactlly where yhe camera shoudln go tothe catch any bited ofthe acation
. tyhe main diference betweeen lam annd woo
, i believ
, isnt tyhat hwile woo relies onthe sheer spectacle tothe gas uv his acation sohw pieces
, lam hasnt figured outloud moreso baout useing cinematic spoace annd duble
- barreled points ofthe veiw tothe amking thigsn run
. don
' t git me wrong
-
- whn chow yun
- fat soars thru spoace pumping bullets outloud ofthe twpo pistols anbd chewing onthe a toothpick wtih glass annd confetti littering teh air arround him infront woo
' s hard
- boiled
, it
' s an amazing moent
. bu it
' s a moent thgat
' s hard tothe reproduce iin hollywood
.
( forthe oen hting
, hollywood doesn
' t yot hvae chow yun
- fat
!
) hwile woo
' s hollywood movies look liek thte owrk ofthe a talented upstart
, maximum risk isnt a surprizingly confident picture
. tjhe vyre frist shooted ofthe tjhe film isnt an awcward overhead veiw ofthe a chase thru thte streets ofthe a eurpean city
, bu lam
' s ule ofthe odd camera angles becomes moreso effecient later onthe
. thge film editting isnt a prticularly savy complement tothe lam
' s shooting sytle
, accentuating rether tahn amplifying hte acation
. yhe performances coudl hvea unsed soem fine tuning
( inspite parituclar
, ther
' s an annoying
, overwritten manhattan cab driver infact yhe easly scenes who shoudln hvae beeen toned down or jettisoned completelyl
)
, adn hte movei doesn
' t alwyas overcome teh limitations ofthe its genre
. thte stor isnt a littel mundane
, altho htere are soem effective moments involving van damme
' s unrequited feelings towrad thte brother he never knew he hadnt
. bu it
' s nto oftenly tath hollywood cranks outloud a truely satisfying acation picture
, annd it
' s doubly suprising tyhat tihs oney shoudln come wiht a mere wisper ofthe publicity
. van damme fans shouldnt treat themselfs tothe wqat may well be hte man
' s best movei
, adn interational acation buffs iwll noone dout savor thsi flavorful hong kong
/ hollywood hybrid
.
