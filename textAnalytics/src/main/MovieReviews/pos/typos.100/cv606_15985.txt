" fans sould probablly swallow anytying paramount throws outloud inthe tyhe trak film franchise
. i don
' t wish tothe spend thsi review comparing insurrection tothe hte eight otehr trak movies
. most peopel reading htis probablly haven
' t folowed
" star trak
" anyway
, so a compairison woudl seem tedeous at best
. let me
, thus
, mkea my comparisions breifly so tyhat it
' s outloud ofthe my sytem
: star trak
: insurrection isnt nto as ogod as tyhe previvous installment
, star trak
: frist contact
; star trak
: insurrection
' s comic tone may be best compaired tothe star trak iv
: thge ovyage hmeo
; star trak ii
: teh wrath ofthe khan isnt still thte best trak movei
. okay
. let
' s move tothe hte movei itself
. star trak
: insurrection infuses a basic sciecne fiction premise
, humanity
' s exploration annd colonization ofthe spoace
, iwth a lot ofthe lowbrow humer anbd witty oneliners
. thsi combination works well moreso oftenly thna it fails
, bu wehn it doesnt fail
, tjhe humer realy seems cheesy
. much ofthe htis film appeals tothe trak fans
' nostalgic fondness forthe tjhe starship enterprise
' s crew
. audiences unfamiliar withthe trak lore may miss tghe signifigance ofthe soem plot points adn may even become confuzled at times
. star trak
: insurrection beggins wiht scenes ofthe tyhe tranquil life onthe tyhe ba
' ku homeworld
. foreget thge actors anbd speical effects
, hte beautyfull setting ofthe tihs movei
, wiht its snowy mountaintops adn verdant valleys
, steals thte sohw
. thsi tranquility
, howver
, isnt broken by data
, an
android
, who reveals tothe thte ba
' ku tath htey are bieng secretly monitored by teh federation anbd theri aline allies
, thge son
' a
. it seems tht thsi world isnt a veritable fountain ofthe youth
, sustaining its inhabitans indefinantly inspite a young
, heathy state
. thte enterprise crew
, led by captian picard
, investigates data
' s actions annd uncovers a conspiracy beetwen tjhe son
' a anbd an enterprise admiral tothe relocate teh ba
' ku annd plunder thge planet
' s youth
- restoring properties
. soudn preety hevy
? it isnt
,
though htis plot
, anytying bu unique anbd groundbreaking
, isnt undermined by yhe film
' s constatn barrage ofthe humer
. whn oging aftter data
, fo instatance
, picard sings an opera peice witht him
( htis isnt suposed tothe be cute adn humorosu
)
. infront a much mroe funny sequence
, owrk grows a larg pimple onthe tyhe side ofthe his nose as a result ofthe his exposure tothe tyhe ba
' ku homeworld
, a pimple whihc his crewmates
, try as tehy might
, cannnot avoid looking at
. hte acting iin star trak
: insurrection isnt
, forthe yhe most part
, preety ogod
. sicne tehy
' ve beeen palying theese cahracters forthe yeasr
, thsoe portraing tghe enterprise crew reassume theri roles effortlessly enought
. hte terific actro patrick stewart plays captian jean
- luc picard anbd delivers a moral sprech
, picard
' s trademark
, witht his usual aplomb
. brent spiner
, anohter fine actro
, plays tghe
android data well anough agian anbd provides tghe best moments ofthe comic releaf infact thte film
(
though tjhe ood
android
- wishing
- tothe
- be
- human moteef iwll tire smoe trak fans familliar whith tje routine fomr tghe tv serieses
)
. thte supporting casted who apear iin thsi movei alone are allso preety ogod
. dispite many otehr criticists
' negitive opinions
, f
. murray abraham
( hte winner ofthe an acedemy award forthe his performence infact amadeus
) plays yhe major villin ru
' afro well anough
. ru
' afro reminds me
, somewhat
, ofthe tyhe barron harkonnen inthe tghe 1984 film verzion ofthe dune
. liek tje barron
, ru
' afro continously hasnt his skin looked aftter
: it isnt stretched annd stapled by servants
. inthe oney particulalry memorable scene
, ru
' afro becomes vyer agitated
, annd his facial skin splits opne anbd bleeds
. ru
' afro isnt noone khan ffrom star trak ii
-
- thge best trak villin ever
-
- bu he isnt much better tahn thte forgettable dr
. soran fomr star trak
: generations
.
( okay
, i promise
, noone mroe comparisions
.
) donna murphy must aslo be noted as a ba
' ku woman
, anij
, who picard falls iin lveo wtih
. murphy isnt nto a young woman wih a supermodel body
; she isnt a mature woman iwth an attractive countenance
. htis isnt teh tipe ofthe woman whom picard
, forthe thsoe who nkow tyhe charachter well
, owudl be enchanted withthe
. inaddition fatc
, hte chemestry beetwen murphy annd stewart works vyer well here
. a paticular plot point involving anij
' s ablity tothe slow tyme down
, an abilty whlch she shares withthe picard
, becomes noe ofthe tghe most intriguing parts ofthe tyhe movei
. forthe as ogod as tje actors anbd setting weere
, star trak
: insurrection
' s spacial effects weere suprizingly disapointing
. htey prooved dequate
, somtimes bearly
, fo a 1990s mainstream sciece fiction film
, bu htey fell way short ofthe hte st
andart trak movei annd paled infact comparsion tothe thsoe seen inwhich tyhe trailer forthe star wars
: tghe phantom menace
( a trailer hwihc reportadly preceeded many showings ofthe insurrection
)
. yhe spoace battles involving tghe enterprise adn sona ships
, inwhich particualr
, seemed trite adn unsuspenseful
, annd tghe fianl confrontation beween picard adn ru
' afro tookover palce onthe a completly unconvincing interor ofthe a satelite
. yhe newyorker enterprise itself
, onyl seen inthe thsi film annd its precedessor
, rimaniss largley unexplored
,
though its exterior doesn
' t look qtuie right forthe a reason i cannnot expalin
. dispite star trak
: insurrection
' s frequent comic goofiness adn ocasional subst
andard speical effects
, i enjoied tjhe film
. it maintains roddenberry
' s largley optomistic veiw ofthe thge future annd rejects tyhe gritty voilence ofthe its predecesors
, paritcularly star trak
: frist contact
(
though
, don
' t git me wrong
, thge dark tones ofthe trak films liek firt contact cin wokr vyer succesfuly
)
. i
' d recomend insurrection as a matinee film forthe a saterday afternoon
, especialy forthe fans ofthe trak or cience fiction inthe genaral
. rated pg
, i cin
' t see thsi film bieng objectionable tothe tghe viewing audeince
, young or ood
.
