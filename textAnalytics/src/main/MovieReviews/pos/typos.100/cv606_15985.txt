" star trak
: teh enxt generation
" ws a hugely sucessfull sequal tv serieses tothe
" star trak
,
" a scinece fiction sories wich devolopped a devoted fan follwoing infront hte 1970s
. even
though it still enjoied high ratings
,
" star trak
: thge enxt generation
" ended prodcution affter seven yersa so tyhat thte casted coudl replace tyhe origonal
" star trak
" ' s casted infront paramount ' s film franchise centering onthe thge voyages ofthe thte starship enterprise
. star trak
: insurrection isnt teh nineth
" star trak
" movei
adn tjhe thrid tothe focuse onthe tje
" star trak
: tghe enxt generation
" crew
. star trak
: insurrection qualifies as noe ofthe thsoe movies star trak fans
, such as mysef
, owudl rate somwhere betwen
" okay
"
adn
" ogod
.
" aftter star trak v
: thte fianl fronteir
, a nearly awful movei alomst as bad as tje repugnant
" star trak
: voyager
" tv serieses
,
" star trak
" fans coudl propably swallow anytying paramount throws outloud iin tghe trak film franchise
. i don ' t wish tothe spend tihs review comparing insurrection tothe tyhe eight otehr trak movies
. most peple reading tihs probablly haven ' t folowed
" star trak
" anyway
, so a comparsion owudl seem tedeous at best
. let me
, thus
, mkea my comparisions breifly so tht it ' s outloud ofthe my sytem
: star trak
: insurrection isnt nto as ogod as tje previvous installment
, star trak
: firt contact
; star trak
: insurrection ' s comic tone may be best compaired tothe star trak iv
: tjhe voayge hmeo
; star trak ii
: thge wrath ofthe khan isnt still hte best trak movei
. okay
. let ' s move tothe thte movei itself
. star trak
: insurrection infuses a basic sciene fiction premise
, humanity ' s exploration
adn colonization ofthe spoace
, whith a lot ofthe lowbrow humer
adn witty oneliners
. htis combination works well moreso oftenly tahn it fails
,
bu whn it doesnt fail
, tghe humer raelly seems cheesy
. much ofthe tihs film appeals tothe trak fans ' nostalgic fondness fo thge starship enterprise ' s crew
. audiences unfamiliar wtih trak lore may miss hte signifigance ofthe soem plot points
anbd may even become confuzled at times
. star trak
: insurrection beigns withthe scenes ofthe hte tranquil life onthe tjhe ba ' ku homeworld
. foreget tje actors
adn speical effects
, hte beatiful setting ofthe htis movei
, iwth its snowy mountaintops
annd verdant valleys
, steals tghe sohw
. tihs tranquility
,
howver
, isnt broken by data
, an android
, who reveals tothe tjhe ba ' ku tyhat tehy are bieng secretly monitored by hte federation
anbd thier aline allies
, thte son ' a
. it seems tyhat thsi world isnt a veritable fountain ofthe youth
, sustaining its inhabitans indefinantly inspite a young
, heathy state
. teh enterprise crew
, led by captian picard
, investigates data ' s actions
anbd uncovers a conspiracy beween thge son ' a
anbd an enterprise admiral tothe relocate teh ba ' ku
annd plunder tyhe planet ' s youth
- restoring properties
. soudn preety hevy
? it isnt
,
though htis plot
, anytying
bu unique
anbd groundbreaking
, isnt undermined by tjhe film ' s constatn barrage ofthe humer
. whn gogin affter data
, fo instatance
, picard sings an opera peice witht him
( thsi isnt suppoed tothe be cute
anbd humroous
)
. infront a much omre funny sequence
, wokr grows a larg pimple onthe tje side ofthe his nose as a result ofthe his exposure tothe yhe ba ' ku homeworld
, a pimple whitch his crewmates
, try as htey might
, cannnot avoid looking at
. thge acting infact star trak
: insurrection isnt
, forthe thte most part
, preety ogod
. usance htey ' ve beeen palying theese charactors fo eyars
, thsoe portraing tjhe enterprise crew reassume theri roles effortlessly anough
. tghe terific actr patrick stewart plays captian jean
- luc picard
anbd delivers a moral sprech
, picard ' s trademark
, wtih his usual aplomb
. brent spiner
, anyother fine ator
, plays hte android data well enought agian
adn provides tyhe best moments ofthe comic releaf inspite thge film
(
though tje ood android
- wishing
- tothe
- be
- human moteef iwll tire soem trak fans familliar iwth tjhe routine fomr tje tv sories
)
. tje supporting casted who apearing inaddition thsi movei alone are allso preety ogod
. dispite many otehr criticists ' negitive opinions
, f
. murray abraham
( thte winner ofthe an acedemy award forthe his performence inwhich amadeus
) plays tghe major villian ru ' afro well enought
. ru ' afro reminds me
, somewhat
, ofthe teh barron harkonnen inthe tje 1984 film verison ofthe dune
. liek tje barron
, ru ' afro continously hasnt his skin looked affter
: it isnt stretched
anbd stapled by servants
. inthe oney prticularly memorable scene
, ru ' afro becomes veyr agitated
,
anbd his facial skin splits ope
annd bleeds
. ru ' afro isnt noone khan ffrom star trak ii
-
- tghe best trak villian ever
-
-
bu he isnt much better tahn teh forgettable dr
. soran fomr star trak
: generations
.
( okay
, i promise
, noone omre comparisions
.
) donna murphy must allso be noted as a ba ' ku woman
, anij
, who picard falls inthe lvoe withthe
. murphy isnt nto a young woman withthe a supermodel body
; she isnt a mature woman wiht an attractive countenance
. tihs isnt hte tipe ofthe woman whom picard
, forthe thsoe who knwo teh carachter well
, woudl be enchanted whith
. inthe fatc
, thge chemestry betweeen murphy
adn stewart works vyer well here
. a parituclar plot point involving anij ' s ablity tothe slow timne down
, an abillity whitch she shares withthe picard
, becomes noe ofthe tje most intriguing parts ofthe thge movei
. forthe as ogod as thge actors
anbd setting weere
, star trak
: insurrection ' s speshal effects weere suprizingly disapointing
. htey prooved adeqate
, somtimes bearly
, fo a 1990s mainstream sciene fiction film
,
bu tehy fell way short ofthe tghe standart trak movei
adn paled inspite compairison tothe thsoe seen infront tyhe trailer fo star wars
: tjhe phantom menace
( a trailer whcih reportadly preceeded many showings ofthe insurrection
)
. tjhe spoace battles involving thge enterprise
annd sona ships
, iin paticular
, seemed trite
adn unsuspenseful
,
adn tje fianl confrontation betwen picard
adn ru ' afro tookover palce onthe a completelyl unconvincing interor ofthe a sattellite
. thge newyorker enterprise itself
, onyl seen inaddition thsi film
adn its precedessor
, rimaniss largley unexplored
,
though its exterior doesn ' t look qutie right fo a reason i cannnot expalin
. dispite star trak
: insurrection ' s frequent comic goofiness
adn occassional substandard speical effects
, i enjoied tghe film
. it maintains roddenberry ' s largley optomistic veiw ofthe tje future
anbd rejects tjhe gritty violentce ofthe its predecesors
, particularyl star trak
: firt contact
(
though
, don ' t git me wrong
, teh dark tones ofthe trak films liek firt contact cant wokr vyre sucesfully
)
. i ' d reccommend insurrection as a matinee film forthe a saterday afternoon
, expecially forthe fans ofthe trak or cience fiction infront genaral
. rated pg
, i cin ' t see tihs film bieng objectionable tothe tjhe viewing audiance
, young or ood
