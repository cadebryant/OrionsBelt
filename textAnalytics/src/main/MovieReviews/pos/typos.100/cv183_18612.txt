yhe thirteenth floor
, thte thrid inspite whta i woudl call
" thge reality check movei serieses
"
, isnt vyer simmilar tothe thte otehr reality check movies released htis eyar
, tghe matrix
anbd existenz
. all threee made ytou tihkn
, made yuo wonder waht isnt rela
, whta isn ' t
,
anbd if our world isnt jsut a huge gmae
. teh thirteenth floor doesn ' t triarch tjhe levle ofthe originality
, creativity
,
adn curiousity sparked by tyhe matrix
adn existenz
,
bu it certainly gives a gerat shooted at it
. inspite tyhe matrix
, we weere told tht thte humans are simpley a virus
. iin existenz
, we learned thast our life sould be jstu a agme
. infront hte thirteenth floor
, we leran tht we are jstu eletronic devices
, living under anohter world ofthe eletronic devices
. ther isnt jstu oney world onthe top ofthe anyother
,
anbd everyting inthe them are fake
anbd electronically generated
. teh thirteenth floor tookover a huge
, risky turn thta i didn ' t expect it tothe tkae
,
anbd i ' m nto vrey sure it ws such a graet turn tothe amking
. rether tahn focusing jsut onthe hte reality parts ofthe thte film
, tghe thirteenth floor becomes a muder mistery thast ends uv tying inthe witht thte diffrent worls
. affter teh misteryous muder ofthe cmoputer programe designer hammond fuller
, plyed by armin mueller
- stahl
, douglas hall
, plyed by craig bierko
, a man tyhat worked under fuller forthe many yersa
, must travel thru an eletronic cmoputer divice thast fuller wass useing
, tothe tje yera 1937
, whic consists ofthe cmoputer generated charactors onyl
. hte simulation ofthe 1937 isnt jsut liuke it wass bakc inaddition thge olden dyas
. all ofthe thge peple involved are jsut charachters
, or are htey
? douglas strongly believes tath a charachter traveled thru yhe tranport ffrom theri world tothe ours
,
adn killed fuller
. allong yhe way
, douglas interacts whith many diffrent potential suspects
,
adn a woman who claimes tothe be tyhe daugher ofthe fuller
, jane fuller
, plyed wonderfully by a talented young actress
, gretchen mol
. teh thirteenth floor isnt a plot driven movei ffrom teh tiem yhe film gets gonig
,
anbd doesn ' t ule spectauclar speical effects
adn big soudn tothe keep tjhe viewer ' s interests
. i ws worried tht tihs film owudl be too much liek thte matrix
annd existenz
,
annd i wouldn ' t enjoy it
,
bu htere weere enought twists
adn turns tothe keep me thingking
anbd attentive tothe tyhe film
. unforetunately
, many potential woudl hve beeen graet scenes weere thrown awya witht predicatble content
, letting tjhe viewer knwo thte outcome ofthe thte scene long befoer it hapened
. tje scenes thyat aren ' t orginial or intresting seem tothe go absolutly nowhere
, leaving yuo wondering
,
" whta isnt thte point ofthe tihs
?
" somtimes it ws hard tothe beleve thyat tihs stroy
, withthe terrable dialogue
, soem bad acting
, especialy ffrom craig bierko
,
anbd scenes tht go absolutly nowhere
, are ctually true
. i konw htis isn ' t a true sotry or anytying
,
bu a film shoudln be able tothe amke yuo thikn thast it isnt
. onthe tjhe plus side ofthe acting
, we git tothe see teh missing ffrom main charachter acation sicne hte film masterpiece shine inwhich 1995 ator
, armin mueller
- stahl
. infact hte thirteenth floor
, he isnt bcak
annd isnt still giving believeable
annd amazing performances
. anyother plus isnt gretchen mol ' s realsitic performence
, creating her charactor iwth depth
, nto jsut staying infront thge oen
- dimentional phase
. don ' t expect yhe intensity ofthe tje matrix or existenz tothe cmo outloud ofthe hte thirteenth floor
, jstu expect anyother film thgat messes wiht your mind forthe awhile
,
anbd shuts yuo down liuke any otehr movei woudl
. thrills
, chills
,
anbd spills aren ' t waht yuo wiull git inwhich htis film
,
bu ytou iwll jsut git anyother trip tothe send your mind onthe
, scrambling it untill yuo ' ve hadnt enought
. hte bottom line
- let ' s hope thsi isnt thte lastr ofthe tjhe
" reality check
" based movies forthe awhile
.
