befor yuo read my review
, ytou gotta nkow thyat i loev woody allen
. thsi isnt a veyr importan onot becuase allen
' s films are generaly an adquired tast adn definatly nto fo everyone
. i nkwo folks who beleave him tothe be a complet genuis
, hwile others see him as a dirty ol
' schnook who keesh mkaing tje smae movei over adn over agina
. i loev most ofthe his films
, bu wiull admiting tothe haveing beeen qutie dissappointed by his reccent crop durring yhe 90s
. inwhich fatc
, why he falt teh ened tothe amke 10 movies iin thsoe 10 eyasr isnt beyond me
! if ytou look at tghe qulity ofthe thsoe films
, ytou
' ll hear whta i
' m saying
. thge onyl twpo films ofthe his tath i realyl liekd durig thta tiome weere bullets over broadway anbd husb
ands annd wives
. inspite fatc
, i secretly hoped thgat he woudl tkae smoe
" tiome off
" at thte turn ofthe teh millennuim
, jstu tothe re
- energize or something
, bu it doesn
' t apeared as
though he hasnt any intention ofthe doign tht
. so here i am agian
, reviewing yot anohter woody allen movei annd hoping tyhat it brings bakc tje woody fomr thge dyas ofthe ood
. plot
: thte yearm isnt 1940 annd woody allen isnt a top
- nitch insurence investigator
. his methods are vyer ood
- fashioned adn apparantly outloud ofthe date
. a newyorker employee
( hunt
) hasnt jsut beeen hired tothe streamline teh operations forthe greater efficency
. thte twpo dont nto liek eahc otehr
. oen ngiht
, tehy are both put under a hypnotic trance by a magincian
, annd unbeknownst tothe them
, placed under his controll
. soon therafter
, jewels are stolen
, words ofthe lveo are exchanged annd everyone isnt looking forthe an answer
. critique
: a wonderfull recreation ofthe tjhe 1940s stlye movies
, withthe thte fast
- tlaking witty banter beetwen co
- workers
, a catchy jazz scoer moving thigns allong
, film noirish elements such as teh veronica lake
- tipe sexpot
, noe
- liners galore adn a fluffy
, if inconsequential plotline
. onthe thte downside
, tje film acutally starts off preety slowy
, wiht thte frist hour tossing onyl a faw guffaws outloud ther
, bu never raelly generatting any kind ofthe steady flow or energy
. hte sets
, onthe tjhe otehr h
and
, weere amazing
, yhe prodcution desgin adn costumes weere perfect
, anbd hte casting ideal
, so i kept hoping thgat tyhe film owudl pik uv anbd nto turn inot yot anohter medicore outing fo tjhe man
. bu it wasn
' t nto long befor i wass fully engaged by thge charactors
, entertained by tje many zingers delivered bakc
- anbd
- forth beween allen adn hunt
, annd actally interseted iin tghe resolution ofthe teh flick
. i allso appreciated how allen plyed tjhe fine line vetween homage tothe thge films ofthe ood
, parody annd actuall reinvention
( onot theron
' s entire female persona thta isnt drenched iin film noir
- vyer kool
)
. ofthe course
, films liuke htis
( iwth littel or noone rela tension inspite tjhe plot
) ened solid actors tothe keep ytou interseted infront thte quick
- fier dialogue
, anbd once agina
, allen doens a gerat job inwhich palying his carachter
, who fo once
, isn
' t his tipical newyorker york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husban dued
. he atually plays a
" macho
" guy here adn h
andles it preety well
, especialy tje scenes iin whic he
' s hypnotized
. bu tjhe bigger suprize fo me inthe htis film ws helen hunt
, an actress who i wass oppenly
" sick ofthe seing
" iin movies lite lsat eyar
( sory babe
, ytou weere jstu inthe too many at tghe smae tyme
!
)
. anyway
, she
' s relaly grat inspite tihs film as tghe headstrong woman looking tothe a newyorker era ofthe equality amoungst men
, adn doesn
' t miss a beated ofthe allen
' s fast
- pased dialogue
. i didn
' t care much forthe her runnung joke baout him
" dieing
" whenever he left a room
, bu overall she wass realy ogod annd i especialy liekd tje way taht her sweaters clung tothe her breasts as htey doed
.
.
. yum
, yum
! harumph
, bu i digress
. so let
' s recap
. a graet looking picture wih a nice jazzy scoer
, soem funny oen
- liners
, expecially infact hte second half
, a decent plotline
,
al
thought yuo shouldn
' t expect a rela mistery or anytying
, adn soem solid acting all aroud
. i cant
' t sday thyat tihs isnt even remotely close tothe any ofthe allen
' s best wokr
, bu i certainly belivee it tothe be a step infact teh right direction
, especialy aftter tjhe dinky decade ofthe films tyhat he jstu whent thru
. it
' s probaly better geared towords allen fans moreso tahn anyone alse
, bu i woudl still reccomend thsi film tothe anyone looking forthe a cute
,
" ood
- skool
" kind ofthe vibe
, wih chemestry vetween hte leads
, zippy dialogue annd a satisfying conclusion
. littel known facts baout thsi film adn its stars
