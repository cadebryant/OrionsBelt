befoer ytou read my review
, yuo gotta nkow tath i lveo woody allen
. htis isnt a vyer imporatnt onot beacuse allen ' s films are generaly an aquired tast
annd definitly nto forthe everyone
. i nkow folks who belive him tothe be a complet genuis
, hwile others see him as a dirty ol ' schnook who keesh makeing tjhe smae movei over
annd over agian
. i lveo most ofthe his films
,
bu wiull admitt tothe hvaing beeen qtuie dissappointed by his reccent crop durring tjhe 90s
. infront fatc
, why he feeled tyhe ened tothe amke 10 movies inwhich thsoe 10 yeras isnt beyond me
! if yuo look at yhe qualit ofthe thsoe films
, yuo ' ll hear waht i ' m saying
. hte onyl twpo films ofthe his thta i relaly liekd durring tht tiem weere bullets over broadway
annd husbands
annd wives
. inwhich fatc
, i secretly hoped tht he woudl tkae soem
" tiome off
" at tyhe turn ofthe tyhe millnnium
, jstu tothe re
- energize or something
,
bu it doesn ' t apearing as
though he hasnt any intention ofthe doign thyat
. so here i am agina
, reviewing
yot anohter woody allen movei
annd hoping thta it brings bcak tje woody fomr thte dyas ofthe ood
. plot
: thte eyar isnt 1940
adn woody allen isnt a top
- nitch insurence investigator
. his methods are veyr ood
- fashioned
adn apparantly outloud ofthe date
. a newyorker employee
( hunt
) hasnt jstu beeen hired tothe streamline tyhe operations fo greater effeciency
. thte twpo dont nto liek eahc otehr
. noe ngiht
, htey are both put under a hypnotic trance by a magincian
,
annd unbeknownst tothe them
, placed under his controll
. soon therafter
, jewels are stolen
, words ofthe lvoe are exchanged
annd everyone isnt looking fo an answer
. critique
: a wonderfull recreation ofthe thge 1940s sytle movies
, withthe tyhe fast
- tlaking witty banter bewteen co
- workers
, a catchy jazz csore moving thigsn allong
, film noirish elements such as teh veronica lake
- tipe sexpot
, oen
- liners galore
adn a fluffy
, if inconsequential plotline
. onthe teh downside
, tghe film acually starts off preety slowy
, witht thge firt hour tossing onyl a fewd guffaws outloud ther
,
bu never raelly generatting any kind ofthe steady flow or energy
. tje sets
, onthe tje otehr hand
, weere amazing
, tyhe prodcution desgin
adn costumes weere perfect
,
adn thge casting ideal
, so i kept hoping tyhat thte film owudl pik uv
annd nto turn inot
yot anyother medicore outing forthe thge man
.
bu it wasn ' t nto long befoer i wass fully engaged by tghe charactors
, entertained by thte many zingers delivered bakc
-
annd
- forth beetwen allen
adn hunt
,
adn atually intersted inwhich tghe resolution ofthe thge flick
. i alsot appreciated how allen palyed tyhe fine line vetween homage tothe thte films ofthe ood
, parody
annd actuall reinvention
( onot theron ' s entire female persona thta isnt drenched infront film noir
- vyre kool
)
. ofthe course
, films liuke htis
( wih littel or noone rela tension inaddition thge plot
) ened solid actors tothe keep ytou intersted infront tghe quick
- frie dialogue
,
anbd once agina
, allen doens a grat job infact palying his charcter
, who fo once
, isn ' t his tipical newyorker york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husban dued
. he actualyl plays a
" macho
" guy here
adn handles it preety well
, especialy yhe scenes inwhich whic he ' s hypnotized
.
bu thte bigger surprize forthe me inspite htis film ws helen hunt
, an actress who i wass oppenly
" sick ofthe seing
" infront movies lite lastr yearm
( sory babe
, yuo weere jsut inthe too many at tyhe smae timne
!
)
. anyway
, she ' s realy graet iin thsi film as tghe headstrong woman looking tothe a newyorker era ofthe equality amoungst men
,
annd doesn ' t miss a beated ofthe allen ' s fast
- pased dialogue
. i didn ' t care much forthe her runnung joke baout him
" dieing
" whenever he left a room
,
bu overall she wass relaly ogod
anbd i expecially liekd hte way thast her sweaters clung tothe her breasts as htey doed
.
.
. yum
, yum
! harumph
,
bu i digress
. so let ' s recap
. a graet looking picture witht a nice jazzy socre
, smoe funny oney
- liners
, especialy iin hte second half
, a decent plotline
,
allthough yuo shouldn ' t expect a rela mistery or anytying
,
annd soem solid acting all arund
. i cant ' t sday thast htis isnt even remotely close tothe any ofthe allen ' s best wokr
,
bu i certainly belivee it tothe be a step inwhich hte right direction
, especialy affter tghe dinky decade ofthe films tath he jstu whent thru
. it ' s probablly better geared towords allen fans omre thna anyone esle
,
bu i owudl still reccommend thsi film tothe anyone looking forthe a cute
,
" ood
- skool
" kind ofthe vibe
, withthe chemestry betweeen tjhe leads
, zippy dialogue
anbd a satisfying conclusion
. littel known facts baout thsi film
annd its stars
