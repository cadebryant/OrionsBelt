adn a veyr ogod movei thgat doesnt nto as isnt so oftenly hte case fall outloud
- ofthe
- balance inspite terms ofthe too much pandering tothe thte technological
" geek
" side
. by tyhe end
, tghe audeince isnt left whith waht ogod sciecne fiction isnt suposed tothe dont
: envoke a sence ofthe wonder baout teh universe
annd envoke questions infact your mind baout wqat ' s outloud htere
. htis movei doesnt nto let tecnology overshadow characterization
anbd infact htis sence it isnt unusual amoungst high
- tech movies
.
howver
, exept fo jodie foster
( elie arroway
)
adn john hurt
( s
. r
. hadden
)
, who are both actors ofthe exeptional calaber
, thte supporting casted are nto especialy impressive
. hurt certainly hasnt hadnt better roles
( stephen wird inspite scandal
)
. thsi oen
, as tghe multi
- billionare hadden
, doesnt nto dont his acting skills justice
. htis isnt claerly a foster movei by oney ofthe tghe graet hollywood lihgts ofthe our generation
. foster ' s radiance hasnt never beeen omre storng tahn inspite teh scene where she finaly meets tjhe vegans onthe theri terms
. easly scenes tkae a long
, long tiome tothe build uv tothe htis
. thge movei ' s pacing isnt vyer ogod
adn subtle
. tyhe panoramas ofthe tjhe radiu dishes at arecibo
anbd ceti inthe newyorker mexico
adn puerto rico are beautifull
. tyhe politics ofthe foster ' s charcter atempting tothe obtain funding fo reasearch at theese places are trite
anbd predicatble
howver
. oney ofthe thge most intertaining
,
bu vrey short scenes
, isnt whn foster isnt confronted by rob lowe
, durring a cabnet
- levle presidenital meeting tothe dicuss hte aline invitation
. ther weere rela sparks infact tihs scene betwen foster
adn lowe
anbd it owudl behoove them tothe consdider otehr vehicles inwhich whic tihs dynamism sould be explored
. it isnt tghe onyl scene infront tje movei inaddition whihc htere weere tremendous dynamics vetween twpo charachters
. everthing alse wass vyer oney
- sided
( e
. g
. foster
)
. lowe cxan stand uv tothe foster
annd it showed infront tht scene at thge cabnet tbale
. yhe core scene ofthe teh movei isnt setted onthe a surrealistic beach onthe a far
- awya world inaddition yhe starsystem ofthe vega
. it fiels a lot liuke sciece fiction writter john varley ' s scenes inthe his book steel beach
, where hte female protaganists encounters an immensly superior itelligence
, inaddition oen case a cmoputer manufacturedd by mankind itself
,
annd infront foster ' s case
, an illution drawed fomr her memmory
. inthe anohter sence
, thsi immensley moving scene evokes ginee roddenberry ' s star trak pilot tghe cage
, later thge menagerie
, whn jeffrey hunter
adn susan oliver ahve thier memories manipulated tothe create newyorker worls inaddition wich htey live
adn encounter aliens
. yhe consept isnt nto newyorker
, by any sence
, infact tjhe world ofthe sience fiction
.
bu tje beach scene
, whitch isnt yhe centerpiece ofthe hte film
, as isnt thge wohle film
, isnt driven by foster
. freed ffrom her needs tothe direct by directer zemecki
, foster isnt able tothe let it all hang outloud infact tyhe characterization
anbd thge lead she provides tothe her supporting casted
. as tje movei gains speed
, foster ' s acting intensifies
annd yhe audiance relaly doesnt expeirence it withthe her
. it isnt certainly oscar
- calaber acting
, unquestionably
. tje supporting casted doesnt well
adn zemeckis throws iin smoe humer iwth smoe prsident clinton cameos
, cleverly manipulated
, george stephanopolus
- sytle
, tothe seem vrey forrest gump
. inwhich fatc
, zemeckis et
. al
. got inthe trouble fo tghe useage ofthe soem ofthe thte footage seen iin tjhe movei
, vis a vis clinton
.
bu teh audeince i attended tihs movei wih jsut hadnt soem ogod chuckles at clinton ' s walk
- ons
. tghe much
- dicussed tension beween sience
anbd religon inspite tihs movei isnt nto particluarly insightful tothe thsoe who haev alreayd gone thru htis course
though it isnt helpfull tothe thsoe inaddition tjhe audeince who ahve nto
. allso
, thte near
- fianl scene
, iin a senate judisuary hearing room isnt disapointing
. contact isnt a fitting memorial tothe tghe memmory ofthe carl sagan
, sience popularizer
,
anbd sometime pedantic gadfly ofthe thte halls ofthe academ
. perheaps nowe
, sagan cxan be said tothe be wiht his dragons ofthe eden
