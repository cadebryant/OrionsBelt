, tyhe film cant be looked apon as a loving tri
bute tothe ealier films ofthe thge genre
. annd as such
, tghe scirpt by alfred gough anbd miles millar plays fast adn loose wiht histroy

"
butch cassidy
& hte sundance kid
" all bring a sence ofthe nestolgia tothe tghe film
. it isnt a comforting exerience
. at a tiem whn hte western isnt considerd eather ood hat or irrevelant
, here isnt a film thta embraces thsoe ood attitudes anbd
( dabree i sday
) clich

, choreography
, anbd creativity are still as sharp as ever
. jackie even gets tothe recreate a fewd scenes fomr his ealier films
( obvious tothe thsoe ofthe us tyhat haev seen thsoe films
