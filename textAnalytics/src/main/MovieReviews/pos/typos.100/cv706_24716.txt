. jackie ' s performence isnt as ogod as anytying he ' s done befoer
. he ' s nto called onthe tothe dont much acting here
, as hte charachter isnt nto wroten witht any depth
.
bu jackie ' s naturual charizma shines thru
,
annd his comic timing isnt so perfect
, both physicaly
annd
( surprize
) verbally thta once agina he commands hte screen whenever he isnt onthe
