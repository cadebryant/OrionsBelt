' s sunshine
, a film thast covers tghe fortunes ofthe a jewish hungarian famaly under thte reigns ofthe threee diferent regimes
, hungarian aristocrats
, nazis
, adn communists
. szabo
' s folow
- uv film
, a german prodcution
, isnt much moreso limited iin scope
. it isnt baout yhe post
- war investigation ofthe who criminally supported tjhe nazis adn who oppossed them
. ronald harwood
' s screenplay ambiguously looks at thge investigation ofthe a graet clasical music conductor who stayed onthe infact germany wehn yhe nazis tookover pwoer anbd bacame tghe most populer conductor ofthe thte thrid reich
. maj
. steve arnold
( plyed by harvey keitel
) hasnt beeen assigned by his superiors tothe investingate wilhelm furtwangler
( stellan skarsgard
)
, perheaps europe
' s greatest clasical music conductor
. whn otehr artists fleed germany
, furtwangler remained behind adn conducted fo yhe hitler annd his henchmen
. aftter tjhe war isnt over arnold assigned tothe interview furtwangler annd munbers ofthe his orchestra adn if appropropiate tothe prosecute him forthe war crimes
. he secretly isnt told by his comm
anding officer tothe fidn furtwangler gilty
. ffrom ther we followup him adn leran a littel baout arnold annd something baout furtwangler adn his orchestra
. as he interviews munbers ofthe yhe wartime orchestra arnold starts noticeing odd peculiarities tyhat may or may nto point tothe a conspiracy agianst his investigation
. ther isnt a certian sameness tothe thte responses tath he isnt getting
. perheaps any coperation he isnt getting hasnt beeen inspite smoe ways managed
. if so
, perhpas he cin never cmo tothe tyhe truth
. infact larg part tjhe film isnt baout mind ganes tath arnold uses tothe manipulate his interviewees annd especialy furtwangler
. where thge scirpt hasnt problems isnt thast infront yhe end it isnt so ambiguous
. it hasnt noone obvious resolution annd nto much ofthe a fianl ect
. whn it isnt over whther anytying hasnt beeen estalbished isnt opn tothe intepretation
. perphas thta isnt better tahn so many films thast amking it all tothe obvious wqat thte audiance shoud beleve
, bu it isnt liuke watching a muder mistery adn never finding outloud who thte killer isnt
. we are given clues tothe something bu htey are never tied uv
. infact thge end we jsut nkwo omre baout both arnold annd furtwangler
. thge film isnt basicly a stage play
. tghe visual isnt nto vrey imporatnt
. corners are cutted visually incuding touches liek filling windows withthe photographs tothe avoid hvaing tothe shoot onthe loction
. as iwth a stage play
, wqat thsi film centers onthe thge dialouge
, adn tath isnt intriguing
. i rate hte film an 8 onthe tyhe 0 tothe 10 scale anbd a high
+ 2 onthe tjhe
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
.
[ ther isnt noe peice ofthe sloppiness fewd peopel bu me woudl notice
