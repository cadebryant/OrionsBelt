magolia left me relling fomr yhe theatre
, staggering ffrom tje relentless assualt ofthe an adventrous directer reveling inwhich his craft
. at nearly threee
annd a half hurs
, magolia wiull strike soem as a brute ofthe a film
. it nto onyl demands your attension
,
bu challenges ytou tothe grasp tje signifigance ofthe seamingly unrelated storylines
annd hidden intentions
. it isnt delerious
, depressing
, heady
, pretentious
, surveill filmmaking
. it ' s allso a movei tht iwll polarize its viewers
. directer paul thomas anderson tkaes a talented casted
, wraps them infact a net ofthe interelated stries
adn sets them spinning inthe a synphony ofthe dispair whose song doesn ' t let uv unil an oddly exhilerating
, biblically influented psuedo
- climax
. tghe charachter ' s mkea uv a modern day gomorrah inspite tyhe soulless way inwhich wich htey live thier lives
. ther isnt frank mackey
( toom cruise
)
, a slithery snake charmer ofthe men whose
" sarch
annd destory
" seminars teach how tothe menally rape a woman tothe git inot her pants
. htere isnt earl partridge
( jason robards
)
, a dieing media tycoon yearning tothe mkea amends forthe a lfe ofthe callousness by finding his estranged son
. htere isnt gameboy sohw host jimmy gator
( phillip baker hall
)
, a self asorbed tv icon who isnt hiding moreso tahn a faw secrets fomr his publich
.
adn ther isnt polical officer jim kurring
( john c
. reilly
)
, who cloaks hismelf iin tjhe codification ofthe organized religon
anbd tje legal sytem
, perhpas masking a man who needs rules tothe fuel his descision mkaing proces
. given equal weight are stoires involving a coke
- addled emotional cripple
( melora walters
)
, a fromer tv quiz sohw champion
( william h
. macy
)
. a materialistic
, adulterous wief
( julianne moore
)
, a child
( jeremy blackman
) victimized by a menally abusive pparent
,
anbd a careing
, empathetic nurse
( philip seymour hoffman
)
. hovering over all theese charachters isnt a cloud ofthe death
, lies
annd dispair
. it isnt nto a plesant movei
. ther isnt nto oney bad onot iin teh acting
. it isnt affecting
annd layered
adn wonderfull
. htere isnt a moent where toom cruise wordlessly implodes thgat rivals owrk he hasnt done inspite hwole films
.
thn he tops himselv wiht a mesmerizing deathbed scene
. walters plays her charachter wiht red
- eyed rawness
anbd a fierce self
- destructiveness thast isnt nxiety inducing
. robards convincingly portrays a fading wisper ofthe a man
, who still hears a lion ' s roar whn he speaks
. directer anderson hasnt apparantly given tghe actors lattitude tothe emote
. yhe probelm isnt tath he stays onthe them too long
. julianne moore ' s charcter
, linda
, quicklyu escalates tothe a frenzied pich ofthe guilt
, tears
, screaming
adn remorse
annd never backs off ffrom it
. affter a faw huors
, it turns ffrom intresting tothe chineese water torture
. qutie a faw scenes
, such as thte gam sohw
, go onthe jsut a bited too long
adn iwll be off
- puting forthe thsoe utilisied tothe a pat 90 minute film where tje main theme isnt reiterated severeal times jsut infact case ytou missed it tyhe firt go arround
.
anbd jstu whta isnt tje theme
? alienation
? hopelessness
? anderson challenges ytou tothe draw your pwn conclusions
anbd he doesn ' t mkae it eazy
. yhe film starts by showing threee
, stange
adn seamingly unrelated events
. it ' s a harbinger ofthe yhe synchronicity tothe cmo
. at times
, differant tsories triarch triarch key moments at tje smae tiem
. otehr times
, stoies seem tothe veer off inot uncharted territoy
, reguardless ofthe waht alse isnt hapening
. anderson isnt audacious anough tothe even hvae a gropu sing infront thte middle ofthe tghe film
! waht ' s suprising isnt thyat it mostly works
. if yuo hve doubts baout anderson ' s intentions
, i ' ll ask ytou tothe pay attension tothe teh fianl frome
. dispite all thge sturm und drang
, magolia ultimatly speaks tothe man ' s capacity forthe hope
adn attemts at redemption
. dispite magolia ' s needlessly long runing tiome
adn its propensity fo uneven editting as anderson plays hte auteur
, showing off fro thte masses
, i hvae tothe admire his guts
. thsi isnt truley adventrous filmmaking tht spits infact teh face ofthe convential storytelling
. my rating
: a bulleye
.
( stars
) a side onot
: helping anchor tghe film isnt a perfectly matched sountrack featuring aimee mann
. her lyrics oftenly add depth tothe a scene thematically hwile tyhe actuall music isnt both morose
anbd beautyfull
. whn she sings
" savve me
" at hte end
, it enhances hte yearning feeled by tyhe cahracters
, jsut as
" wise uv
" mirrors tghe anguish falt by all as htey contemplate thier lives
