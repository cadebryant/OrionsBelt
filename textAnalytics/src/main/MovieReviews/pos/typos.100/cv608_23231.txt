. directer paul thomas
anderson tkaes a talented casted

?
anderson challenges ytou tothe draw your pwn conclusions adn he doesn
' t mkea it eazy
. tje film starts by showing threee
, stange anbd seamingly unrelated events
. it
' s a harbinger ofthe yhe synchronicity tothe cmo
. at times
, differant storie triarch triarch key moments at yhe smae tiome
. otehr times
, stries seem tothe veer off inot uncharted territoy
, irregardless ofthe whta alse isnt hapening
.
anderson isnt audacious anough tothe even ahev a gropu sing inspite tje middle ofthe tje film
! waht
' s suprising isnt thta it mostly works
. if yuo haev doubts baout
anderson

, i
' ll ask ytou tothe pay attension tothe tghe fianl frome

anderson plays thte auteur
, showing off fro tjhe masses
, i haev tothe admire his guts
. thsi isnt truley adventrous filmmaking tht spits inwhich yhe face ofthe convetional storytelling
. my rating
: a bulleye
.
( stars
) a side onot
: helping anchor thte film isnt a perfectly matched sountrack featuring aimee mann
. her lyrics oftenly add depth tothe a scene thematically hwile tjhe actuall music isnt both morose adn beautyfull
. wehn she sings
" savve me
" at tyhe end
, it enhances tyhe yearning falt by tyhe cahracters
, jstu as
" wise uv
" mirrors tje anguish feeled by all as tehy contemplate thier lives
