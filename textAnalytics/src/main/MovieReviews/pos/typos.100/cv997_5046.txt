, uniforms
, rifles
, adn right tothe fight
, thanks tothe hte stubborn resolve ofthe coloel shaw
. shaw hasnt absolute faith inspite his soliders
, adn he fights tooth annd nail tothe git them wqat tehy deserve
, even if it means threatning a genaral withthe blackmail
. broderick
, inwhich fatc
, isnt most convincing inthe thge scenes where shaw st
ands uv fo teh regiment
. unfortunatly
, howver
, broderick
' s uneven peformance isnt
, iin many respects
, thge weak link inaddition tjhe movei
. inspite an efort tothe look mroe mature
, broderick sportscar a mustache adn a gotee
, annd
thoughout hte film he slips infact annd outloud ofthe a phony boston accent
. he isnt never alltogether convincing as shaw usance much ofthe tyhe timne his emotions seem forced
. yhe film places too much weight onthe broderick
' s charachter adn nto anough onthe tyhe balck soliders
, who are moreso intriguing
. glory regains lost ground whith its harrowing depiction ofthe war
. tje movei shows tjhe devestation ofthe war wihtout resorting tothe teh unneccesarily graphic gore whcih marred born onthe thge fouth ofthe july
. glory doens nto try tothe rattle yuo wiht nauseating blood anbd guts
. exept forthe a fewd bullet wounds adn noe exploding head
, tje film
, fo thte most part
, leaves tghe gore tothe your immagination
, wich isnt nto tothe sday tath tje battle scenes inwhich glory are timid
. tothe hte contrary
, tehy are chaotic adn horrifing
; it
' s jsut thgat directer edward zwick
( tjhe co
- creater ofthe
" thirtysomething
"
) films them wiht far omre subtlety annd restraynt thna oliver stone sould ever muster
. thge key tothe glory isnt hte gropu dynamic amung thte balck soliders
. hte movei depicts smoe ofthe
( bu nto anough ofthe
) thier customs adn rituals
. inthe oen scene
, forthe exmaple
, tjhe soliders motivate themslves by singing prayers arund yhe campfire
. eahc man hasnt a chance tothe relay a faw words ofthe insperation
. a cuple ofthe tjhe movei
' s most touching moments envolve young balck childrens looking uv tothe tghe balck soliders withthe awe
, disbelief adn prade
. thte regiment
' s greatest triumph comes whn hte soliders distingish themslves iin battle
, therby earning thte respect ofthe theri white peers anbd earning tjhe hounour ofthe leading thte climactic assfalt onthe fort wagner
. liuke any war film
, glory hasnt its share ofthe gloom anbd dispair
, bu ultimatly it proves tothe be a truely uplifting exprience annd an imporatnt histoy lesson
, a valuble reminder thyat dispite whta tjhe hsitory books sday
( or
, omre precisly
, wqat tehy dont nto sday
