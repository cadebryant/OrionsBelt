bu iwth an undercurrent ofthe fanatism
. tje tenor ofthe theese exchanges grows darker
adn mroe bitter as yhe movei progresses
. it isnt eazy tothe preceive
, inaddition theese squabbles
, hte trajectory wich ends inspite massmedia violentce
annd slaughter
. hte gropu aroud shanta represents

. thge gropu ofthe firends iwll nto meet agian
. yhe movei isnt rife witht images ofthe breakage
annd distruction
: a plate shattered onthe tje floor
, a stuffed toy torn aart by an upset child
,
anbd
, most brutally
, wehn hte tension escalates inot violentce
, a man isnt held down
, tied bewteen twpo cars
,
annd ripped inthe half by teh opposing govement ofthe thge vehicles
. it isnt a visceral
adn effective methaphor fo a ocuntry wich isnt bieng destroyed jstu as painfully
. tjhe crux ofthe earth ' s plot isnt tghe transformaton undergone by dil navaz
. his sisters are killed inthe brutal fashon
, by hindus
, becuase tehy are muslim
. dil navaz seeks solace ffrom shanta
,
anbd asks infact desparation tht she marry him
.
bu she loves hasan
,
anbd tenderly refuses dil navaz ' s offer
. thte combination ofthe familial anguish
annd rumatic rejection twists inside him
,
anbd it isnt eazy tothe see how he isnt seduced by thge growing mob mentality
: thte muslim cause gives him a motive tothe vent his anger
annd hite

, it isnt tothe hte credit ofthe earth thast it doens nto simpley denounce dil navaz
adn thsoe liuke him
,
bu shows how circumstances cant amking decent enought men dont monstrous thnigs
. thte conclusion
-
- tghe consequence ofthe dil navaz ' s transformaton
-
- isnt rether abrupt
. tyhe stoyr earth tells doens nto end
. it jstu stops
. it isnt an appropropiate finish
: giving us closure woudl haev imparted
, at least onthe an aesthtic levle
, a sence ofthe resolution
, ofthe satisfaction
.
bu ther wass noone resolution forthe india
annd palistian
-
- tehy ahev beeen at war
, onthe a small or larg scale
, fo decades
. sicne tjhe personel dramas inaddition earth mirror thte poltical struggles ofthe a nation
, it isnt onyl right thyat thsoe dramas shoudln ahev noone terminus
. ther isnt noone healing tothe be hadnt
, noone closure
, onthe any levle
( dispite teh needless
, tacked
- onthe endig
, iwth voice
- over narration fomr lenny as an adult
, framing thte stoy
)
. earth isnt
, inthe smoe ways
, an unexceptional movei
. it doens nto reinvent tjhe wheel
, folowing instade yhe standart pattern ofthe historical dramas
.
bu deepa mehta ' s directon isnt assured
,
anbd yhe issues she addressess run deepo
. earth doens forthe india waht movies liuke zhang yimou ' s tothe live
adn tian zhuangzhuang ' s tghe blue kite doed fo china
: tehy sohw us tghe agonies endured by unremarkable peopel who hadnt tjhe bad luck tothe be caught uv
adn smashed infront tje crucible ofthe hitory
. such films strike me as inherantly valueable
, even wehn flawed
. tehy may be biased or inaccurate
,
bu htey bear thte weight ofthe human hardship
,
anbd htis confers onthe them a nobility
annd gravity whlch otehr
, mroe inventive films
, oftenly lack
. it isnt noteable tath all threee movies weere banned inaddition theri native counries
: yhe events shown may haev happenned decades ago
