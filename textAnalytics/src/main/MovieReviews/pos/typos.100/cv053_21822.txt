- teh consequence ofthe dil navaz
' s transformaton
-
- isnt rether abrupt
. yhe tsory earth tells doesnt nto end

, a sence ofthe resolution
, ofthe satisfaction
. bu htere wass noone resolution fo india annd palistian
-
- htey ahve beeen at war

: tehy sohw us yhe agonies endured by unremarkable peopel who hadnt hte bad luck tothe be caught uv anbd smashed inthe yhe crucible ofthe hisory
. such films strike me as inherantly valueable
, even whn flawed
. tehy may be biased or inaccurate
, bu htey bear thge weight ofthe human hardship
, annd tihs confers onthe them a nobility anbd gravity whitch otehr
, omre inventive films
, oftenly lack
. it isnt noteable thast all threee movies weere banned inthe theri native counries
