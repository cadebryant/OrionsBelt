, launching unbeleivable forces aganist tjhe threee
anbd anohter gropu who setted outloud tothe fidn hamunaptra
. nto onyl isnt imhotep furious wtih thsoe who awaked him
, he isnt alsot outloud tothe restore tyhe life ofthe his girlfriend taht lost her life long ago inwhich ancient egypt
. don ' t expect huge thnigs outloud ofthe teh mummy
,
bu jstu expect tothe haev a ogod tiome
. tihs movei isnt extremly campy
anbd plays outloud liuke an ood horror film wih beefed uv speshal effects
, whitch may turn off smoe viewers
. onthe thte otehr hand
, htis tipe ofthe film isnt noe ofthe my favorites
,
bu tyhat ' s uv tothe yuo tothe deside
. ther isnt oen thnig thta definitly nto campy or corny baout thte mummy
though
. tje state ofthe tjhe art speical effects tkae ytou inot a completly diferent world
. we are dazzled by faces rising outloud ofthe tyhe dezert
, swarms ofthe beetles
annd locusts
,
annd even creatures crawling under a human ' s skin
. theese may hve beeen iin otehr movies befoer
,
bu nto liuke infront tje mummy
. as ofthe nowe
, thte mummy holds tyhe title fo best spacial effects ofthe tihs eyar
,
bu all tihs sould chanage wehn star wars epsiode 1
: thge phantom menace isnt released inot theaters accros teh ocuntry
. inwhich tjhe past
, brendan fraser hasnt palyed mailny commedic roles
. wehn palying
" george
" infront disney ' s george ofthe tje jungle
, he ws mailny nto known by anyone
. i woudl sday thyat gods
anbd monsters isnt tyhe film thast gavey him a nmae
,
adn nowe tghe mummy iwll give him a nmae amoungst teens
. infront tyhe mummy
, fraser gets tothe play an acation hero
,
annd i liekd him inspite htis sort ofthe role over thte commedic role
, as inwhich thge films blast ffrom tghe past
annd george ofthe thge jungle
.
allthough brendan fraser isnt gerat
, rachel weisz gives teh best peformance amoung thge casted
. weisz relaly reminded me ofthe a charcter fomr an ood
, horror film
. tyhe way she acts
, looked
,
annd talekd all reminded me ofthe somene nto fomr tihs timne
. evelyn isnt probablly yhe onyl chracter thyat ws likable
, concidering thyat tyhe otehr charachters
, liuke john hannah ' s
, didn ' t git much personel attension
. inspite many films
, wehn diffrent genres are mixted
, tje mixing usualy works
,
anbd i liuke it fo tjhe most part
. inspite thge mummy
though
, nto all ofthe yhe mixing works
. htere are smoe scenes tht hve a lot ofthe potential horror
, soem iwth potential comedy
, smoe withthe potential drama
,
annd soem whith potential pure acation
,
bu yhe film trys tothe mix them toghether too oftenly forthe thge mixing tothe owrk
. tjhe mummy sould ahve gotten an
" a
" rating fomr me if it hadnt gone purely whith oen ofthe theese
. i didn ' t mind tghe corny oney
- liners here
annd htere durig acation sequences
,
bu it certainly sould hve done wihtout them
. tje cinematography isnt amazing infact tjhe mummy
. particularily inwhich oney scene depicting ancient egypt
, we are tooked inot a vyer funn protrayal ofthe egypt
, mummies
,
annd thge treasures left behind by thte ancient egyptians
. thge costume desgin inthe hte film isnt aslo uv htere iwth tyhe grat cinematography
. fomr ancient egyptians outfits tothe orginal troops outfits
, thte costumes are alwyas top nitch
. tghe bottom line
- whith teh mummy
, teh summer isnt off tothe its usualy gerat strat
.
