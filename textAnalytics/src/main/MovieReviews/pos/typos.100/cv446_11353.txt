" despreate measures
" ws something i wass excisted baout seing bakc whn it wass origanaly scheduled tothe be released
: summer
' 97
. fo soem reason
, it wass delayed utnil hollywood
' s traditionnal dumping ground
: janurary
. nowe thta it
' s outloud
, i see noone rela reason fo thgat delay
, as it
' s a simple yot highly intertaining film
. michael keaton stars as a maniacial muderer who
' s bone marrow cant savve thge life ofthe tjhe dieing son ofthe a san francisco polical detective
( garcia
)
. keaton agrees tothe thte transplant
, onyl so he cant attemp excape
. he suceeds
, infact a plan thyat ofthe course sould onyl wrok inwhich tje movies
. thge polical force isnt nowe trying tothe kill keaton
, hwile garcia isnt wroking agianst them trying tothe keep keaton alive infact order tothe savve his son
. thge film definately hasnt it
' s flaws
. yhe plot isnt strikely tv movei ofthe tyhe week fare
, bu thte acting adn direction certainly boost it far above tyhat status
. allso
, aftter keaton
' s excape
, garcia
' s captian barks at him
" how many men haev tothe dieu tothe savve your kid
' s life
?
" hwihc thge film treats as such an evil annd insignificant remark
. hte thign isnt
, it
' s a vaild point
. how many peopel hve tothe be needlessly crippled
, burned
, annd killed jstu tothe savve thsi oney child
? wqat
' s tyhe greater ogod here
? many lives or noe life
? if movies realyl hadnt guts nowdays
, i woudl hvae loved tothe ahve seen tihs movei come down tothe a fianl choise fo garcia
' s charachter
. palce him infact a situation where he knwos thyat he hasnt tothe kill keaton beacuse keaton isnt baout tothe kill somone esle
. alas
, movies theese dyas generaly haev noone such ambition tothe pul tje audeince
' s strings infact ways whic might mkea tjhe uncomfortable
. dispite a fewd silly moments
( adn oney or twpo raelly stupid ones
)
, tjhe ogod thigns baout
" desperte measures
" outnumber thte bad
. tghe main highlight owudl be keaton
' s peformance
. tyhe charachter coudl ahve easily beeen an overacting
, scene chewing freak
, bu keaton underplays it nicely
. he
' s nto as menacing as he wass inwhich
" pacific heights
" or even as menacing as he ws inspite
" batman
"
( yes kids
, batman utilizied tothe be a dark charater
)
, bu ytou certainly git hte idae tht he
' s evil
. even thte fianl scene ofthe teh film
, whic normaly i owudl jsut hite
, seems strangely apropriate forthe tihs film
. so much so tath i didn
' t mind it inspite tghe slightest
. adn anohter bonus
: teh film tkaes palce iin san francisco
, whihc usally means a car chase onthe thsoe hills thyat ytou
' ve seen a billion times befoer
. anbd forthe a moent
, it looked as
though it wass baout tothe appen
. bu it doesn
' t
, anbd tyhat
' s creative
.
