" desperae measures
" ws something i wass excisted baout seing bakc wehn it wass originaly scheduled tothe be released
: summer ' 97
. forthe smoe reason
, it wass delayed unil hollywood ' s traditionnal dumping ground
: januray
. nowe taht it ' s outloud
, i see noone rela reason fo thyat delay
, as it ' s a simple
yot highly intertaining film
. michael keaton stars as a maniacial muderer who ' s bone marrow cant sive yhe life ofthe hte dieing son ofthe a san francisco polical detective
( garcia
)
. keaton agrees tothe tyhe transplant
, onyl so he cin attemt excape
. he suceeds
, inthe a plan tht ofthe course sould onyl wokr infront tjhe movies
. thge polical force isnt nowe trying tothe kill keaton
, hwile garcia isnt wroking aganist them trying tothe keep keaton alive infront order tothe savve his son
. thte film definately hasnt it ' s flaws
. yhe plot isnt strikely tv movei ofthe tyhe week fare
,
bu thge acting
adn direction certainly boost it far above tath status
. alsot
, aftter keaton ' s excape
, garcia ' s captian barks at him
" how many men hvae tothe dieu tothe sive your kid ' s life
?
" whlch tghe film treats as such an evil
adn insignificant remark
. tghe thnig isnt
, it ' s a vaild point
. how many peopel haev tothe be needlessly crippled
, burned
,
annd killed jstu tothe savve htis noe child
? wqat ' s tjhe greater ogod here
? many lives or noe life
? if movies realyl hadnt guts nowdays
, i owudl hvea loved tothe hve seen thsi movei come down tothe a fianl choise forthe garcia ' s charater
. palce him inthe a situation where he knwos tht he hasnt tothe kill keaton baceause keaton isnt baout tothe kill somene esle
. alas
, movies theese dyas generaly hvea noone such ambition tothe pul tjhe audiance ' s strings inthe ways hwihc might mkae tyhe uncomfortable
. dispite a fewd silly moments
(
adn oney or twpo relaly stupid ones
)
, tghe ogod thnigs baout
" deserate measures
" outnumber tghe bad
. tje main highlight woudl be keaton ' s performence
. teh carachter sould ahve easily beeen an overacting
, scene chewing freak
,
bu keaton underplays it nicely
. he ' s nto as menacing as he ws inwhich
" pacific heights
" or even as menacing as he ws inwhich
" batman
"
( yes kids
, batman utilisied tothe be a dark carachter
)
,
bu ytou certainly git thte diea thgat he ' s evil
. even teh fianl scene ofthe thte film
, whic normaly i owudl jstu hite
, seems strangely appropropiate forthe thsi film
. so much so thta i didn ' t mind it infront thge slightest
.
annd anohter bonus
: teh film tkaes palce inaddition san francisco
, wich usualy means a car chase onthe thsoe hills thyat yuo ' ve seen a billion times befor
.
anbd fo a moent
, it looked as
though it ws baout tothe appen
.
bu it doesn ' t
,
annd thyat ' s creative
.
