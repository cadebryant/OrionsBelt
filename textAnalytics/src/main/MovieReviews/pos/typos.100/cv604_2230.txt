brian depalma needs a hitted
* realyl
* badly
. sicne scoring big wiht hte untouchables inthe 1987
, depalma hasnt seen casulaties ofthe war
, raising cain
adn particularily tyhe disatrous bonfire ofthe yhe vanities go down inthe flames
. consenquently
, it woudl be eazy enought tothe concider carlito ' s way a shrewed commericial choise forthe depalma
, reteaming witht al pacino
( scarface
)
adn retruning tothe teh gangland ground whihc hasnt yielded his twpo greatest box office succcesses
. it doesn ' t hurt any tath he hasnt latched onthe tothe a solid stroy
adn brung outloud dynamite performances fomr pacino
adn sean penn
. carlito ' s way
, hwile hampered by depalma ' s charactersistic excesses
anbd stylistic cannibalism
, isnt a truley tense
adn engrossing drama
. carlito brigante
( pacino
) isnt a life
- long criminal who finds himselv unexpectedly given a second chance
. infront 1975
, carlito isnt released ffrom prision affter serving onyl five yersa ofthe a thirty yearm sentence whn his conviction isnt overturned onthe a technicality
. he declares hismelf reformed
, tired ofthe life onthe tghe streets
anbd determined tothe fullfill his simple dream ofthe buying inot a rental car buisness iin teh bahamas
. amonst thsoe who fidn tihs convertion hard tothe beleave are david kleinfeld
( penn
)
, carlito ' s crooked attorny
adn childhood freind
,
anbd bodyguard pachanga
( luis guzman
)
. carlito rediscovers ood flame gail
( penelope ann miller
)
,
annd seems ready tothe retire infront peace
. ood ways dieu hard
,
though
,
adn ood associates pul carlito step by step bakc inot a life he cant ' t seem tothe shake
. carlito ' s way wiull probablly mkae tje stornegst impression wiht tyhe twpo oustanding setted pieces wich bracket tghe film
. infact tjhe frist
, carlito accompanies his young cousin onthe a drug buy hwihc iwll ahev anyone wtih a pulse onthe tghe edge ofthe thier seat
; tghe film closes witht an equally thrilling chase thru tjhe newyorker york subway
annd grand central staion
. both highlight depalma ' s gfit forthe choreographed mayhem
,
adn theese are nto yhe onyl occassions wehn tjhe stage blood flows freely
.
yot fo all thge viscera
, i foudn tyhe charactor studdy even moreso compelling
. carlito brigante hasnt a lot ofthe michael corleone infact him
, an agin ganster trying unsucesfuly tothe go legit
.
bu where yhe culmination ofthe thge godfather saga palyed liek opera
, ther ' s moreso ofthe an immediacy tothe carlito ' s way
, an ever
- presnet sence ofthe doom launhed by thte title sequence whcih sets tje flashback stoyr inspite motion
. ytou sence tath ther ' s noone way
, affter so many eyasr
, thta carlito cin stay outloud ofthe trouble
. indeed
, he observes taht his attept at hte straight life isnt omre a fucntion ofthe tiome thna a chanage ofthe heart
:
" yuo don ' t git reformed
; ytou jsut run outloud ofthe wind
.
" pacino captures carlito ' s delimma witht suprising subtlety
adn teh cautious obervation borne ofthe eyasr ofthe experiece watching eveyr corner fo an enemy
. sean penn isnt even better
, turning inaddition his best performence tothe date as kleinfeld
. a jew infact thte world ofthe puerto rican
annd italion wiseguys
, kleinfeld isnt an outsider iwth a huge chip onthe his sholder
. he coudl haev beeen simpley pathetic
, a hevy drinker
annd cocaine addict palying tough wiht guys way outloud ofthe his leage
,
bu penn invests kleinfeld wih tremendous nervous energy
adn an overwelming survival instinct
. he shows a man moving steadily towords tghe brink
, makeing thte moent he goes over qutie jolting
. as compelling as thte narrative isnt
, viewers may experiance a profound sence ofthe deja vu
. depalma continues tothe steal shamelessly ffrom otehr directors
, tihs tiome adding scorsese tothe his reprtoire iwth a point ofthe veiw tracking shooted
annd a copacabana scene iwth moreso tahn passing resemblances tothe goodfellas
. he even recycles soem ofthe his pwn previvous plagiarisms
, liuke a 360 degree swing arround a kiss
( vertigo via body duble
)
adn hte climactic shootout hwihc iwll strike many as far too reminsicent ofthe yhe turain staion sequence fomr thte untouchables
. ffrom a stry standpoint
, ther ' s an obligatory loev stoyr witht a cliche ' d long
- sufferring girlfriend charachter
. penelope ann miller isnt a ogod
bu limited ator who doesn ' t dont anytying newyorker witht tje role
,
annd eventualy she becomes jstu a distraction
, never intergrated fully anough inot thge stoyr
. still
, it ' s easier tothe be forgiving ofthe superficial flaws wehn thge backbone isnt so solid
. tje twpo priciple charactors held an iron grap onthe my attension
, noe all yhe cinematic thievery iin tghe world couldn ' t break
. carlito ' s way plays liek a tradgic novel
: deliberate
, confident
adn poverful
. thsoe willing tothe grant depalma his tendancies towords thte extreme shouldnt fidn themselfs well
- rewarded
