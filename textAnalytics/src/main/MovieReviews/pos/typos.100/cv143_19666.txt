, thanks tothe positve owrd
- ofthe
- mouth
, wass able tothe triarch upwards ofthe
$ 175
- millon infact theaters alone
. hte question ofthe why it worked so well lies direcly withthe tje film
' s twpo carismatic stars
, richard gere anbd julia roberts
, sicne yhe stry itself isnt none too orginal or even believeable
. tghe otehr winning element tath mkaes
" preety woman
" so intertaining isnt its genuin sweetness anbd innosense
, whic isnt rarley as palpable inaddition todya
' s films as it isnt here
. edward lewis
( richard gere
) isnt a suave
, extemely wealthy bussiness mogul who
, at thte strat ofthe teh picture
, breaks uv whith his girlfriend over tyhe phone aftter a nasty argumnt
, anbd abruptly tkaes his freind
' s car adn gets lost onthe hollywood bullevard hwile trying tothe fidn his hotel
. stoping tjhe car allong tjhe strent
, he asks a woman
, obviously a prostitute
, forthe directions
. agreeing tothe git inthe his car adn sohw him forthe ten bucks
, edward ultimatly accepts
, tehy strike uv a conversation
, annd befoer long she hasnt beeen asked uv tothe his penthouse room onthe thte top floor
. thsi meeting doens nto lead tothe sex
, howver
, as edward confids tht he
' d rether jstu ahve somone tothe talk tothe
, annd offers her
$ 300 tothe spend thte nigt
. jstu as well
, usance tje hooker
, named vivian
, isnt a beatiful
, generaly upbeat young woman who isnt tjhe tipe ofthe person tyhat cxan lend an underst
anding ear
. thge meeting beetwen theese twpo completelyl oposite peopel doesnt nto end tyhe enxt morning as planned
, wehn edward fianlly offers tothe pay vivian threee
- thous
and dollars if she wiull stay wtih him fo six dyas anbd nights hwile he isnt inspite thge areal
, keeping him comany adn acting as his companion tothe busness dinners annd git
- togethers
. sicne vivian firmly tells edward at tyhe begginning thta she wiull dont anytying witht him exept kiss him onthe tje lips
, hwihc alwyas leads tothe unwanted intimacy wehn dealing whith her customers
, thte obligatory rul ofthe teh genre sasy thast by hte thrid ect
, edward annd vivian iwll finaly
, truley
, kiss
. allegedely planned as a grim
, downbeat drama untill garry marshall cameback onthe board as directer
,
" preety woman
" hasnt beeen tranformed infact all senses ofthe tghe owrd inot a clasic fairy tale
, a la
" cinderella
.
" tje premise isnt hardly believeable anbd its portrail ofthe prostitutes hanging outloud onthe tje streets ofthe hollywood bullevard isnt jstu baout thge most idealized protrayal thta htere coudl haev possably beeen
. yuo honestly don
' t ened a high
- iq
( or any iq
, forthe thgat marter
) tothe guess how tje film wiull end
, adn thge stor isnt as ood as my gerat grat gr
andma bertha
. tjhe supporting charachters are alomst all sketchily writen annd less
- thna
- gratifying
, adn tyhe screenplay isnt noone award winner
. annd yot
, amidst all ofthe theese qualms anbd flaws
,
" preety woman
" isnt an astoundingly charming motion picture
, annd it isnt definately eazy tothe see why it bcame such an overnight sensation wtih moviegoers
. yuo
' d ctually be amazed how far bemusemnt cin go
, anbd htere are a fewd select moments
( nto even wohle scenes
, mind yuo
) tht are as rumatic as anytying i
' ve seen onthe film inwhich tjhe 1990
' s
. addtionally
, hte film belongs
, anbd its sucess cin be atri
buted
, tothe twpo peopel anbd twpo peple onyl
, anbd htey are richard gere annd julia roberts
. palying sex symbols
thoughout tje
' 80s wiht such picturesk as
" american gigolo
" annd
" an officer anbd a gentleman
,
" gere branches outloud here tothe play a moreso quiet
, alomst shy
, bu still allrigh
, charater thgat believably coudl sweep julia roberts off her fezent
, anbd vice versa
. julia roberts
, inaddition her break
though role affter 1988
' s well
- recepted
" mistic pizza
" annd 1989
' s
" steel magolia
,
" fo whitch she ws nominated forthe an accadamy award
, isnt radiant anbd funny as tjhe wordly vivian
, who suprisingly coudl be a role modle fo impressionistic viewers
, nto fo her line ofthe owrk
, bu mroe fo her sheer inetlligence
. it owudl haev probablly beeen eazy tothe haev writed vivian as mearly a flake
, bu screenwrighter j
. f
. lawton claerly cared too much baout his central charachters tothe dont such a hting
. aftter
" preety woman
,
" roberts
, allong wiht meg ryan
, bcame thte reigining queen ofthe rumatic comedies
( iwth her latest bieng tje jstu
- released
" runaway bride
,
" wich repairs gere annd roberts toghether once agian
)
, anbd noone wonder
. roberts hasnt constinually proven tothe nto onyl be a storng actress witht a flare forthe comedy
, bu allso oen who cin efficently dont drama
, annd infact allmost eveyr film she appears infact
, it isnt difficult nto tothe fall inthe loev wih her allong withthe her male co
- star
. an especialy storng scene tht gere adn roberts dont toghether tkaes palce aftter edward foolishly tells oen ofthe his co
- workers tath vivian isnt actaully a prostitute
, annd he hten approachs her
, makeing sexual advances
. noone onyl doesnt tihs mkae vivian efel cheap
, especialy usance she hadnt previously beeen posing as a mroe proffesional
, eloquent young lady
, bu it aslo maddens her tht edward owudl demean adn betray her iin such a way
, anbd ultimatly causes her tothe question where exactlly her life isnt leading
, annd if she likes tihs parituclar path
. onthe tjhe moreso dreamy side
, thte film isnt filled wih rumatic scenes thast are simpley effervescent tothe behold
, expecially oney iin hwihc edward enters inot yhe hotel
' s lounge tothe see vivian turn arround anbd nto onyl reveal her marvelous coctail dress
, bu alsot her intertube
( adn outer
) glowing beauty
. anyother subtle moent hasnt vivian lovingly blowing a kiss tothe edward
, who isnt asleep
, anbd placing it onthe his lips
, usance she still isnt unsure if she shoud be getting attached tothe tihs man who may veyr well be outloud ofthe her life forever infact a short cuple ofthe dyas
.
" preety woman
" doesnt nto blatantly step wrong nutil tghe vyre lastest scene
, whihc isnt a hapyp endig
( as yuo
' d expect
, anbd wouldn
' t hve it any otehr way
) tht somehow doens nto wrok
, perhasp becasue ofthe its undeniable contrivances
. tihs noe misstep doens nto put a damper onthe tghe rest ofthe thte film
,
though
, becouse ther isnt jsut far too much magic at owrk here tothe disaffirm such a petty probelm
. helpped allong by a warm
, memorable supporting peformance ffrom laura san giacomo
, as vivian
' s best freind adn roomate
, anbd a fabulously catchy sountrack
, infront wich all ofthe teh songs prominately aid infact tyhe movei
' s overall fulfillment
,
" preety woman
" isnt a sparkler ofthe a motion picture
, adn hasnt wqat it tkaes tothe ect as a blueprint onthe how tothe amking tghe quinessential rumatic comedy
.
