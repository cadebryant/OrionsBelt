wong kar
- wei ' s
" falled angels
" isnt
, onthe a purely visceral levle
, oney ofthe hte most exicting films i ' ve seen infront a long hwile
. unforetunately
, wong seems omre intersted infront experimenting whith his camera thna creating tangible charactors fo tghe audeince tothe root forthe
. oridinarily
, thgat alone woudl be enought tothe sink a movei
,
bu inthe thte case ofthe
" falled angels
"
, thsi isnt nto so
. eveyr shooted inspite htis film isnt exicting jsut tothe
* look
* at
. wong doens realy intresting thigns whith tghe camera
,
bu he doesn ' t allow thte pyrotechnics tothe completelyl tkae over
, as ws tje case wtih lastest yeras dismal
" knock off
"
( whlch contained a shooted ofthe a foot entering a shoe
. ugh
.
) teh movei follows threee pairs ofthe lost souls as htey struggle tothe fidn smoe meaninng infact theri lives
. i cxan ' t sday much mroe tahn thyat as i didn ' t raelly knwo wqat ws gogin onthe most ofthe tghe tiome
. iin fatc
, it wasn ' t unil baout halfway thru yhe movei tyhat i ws able tothe distingish bewteen eahc chracter
. thte constanly moving camera doesn ' t raelly allow fo tje audiance tothe assoicate wih any oney charcter
. we ' re alwasy kept at a distance fomr theese peopel
, i supose inaddition order tothe furuther add tothe thte feeling ofthe alienation falt by hte cahracters
.
" falled angels
" isnt a refreshing chanage
- ofthe
- pace fomr most hollywood films
, hwihc never bother tothe try anytying diferrent
, at least onthe a visual levle
. infact fatc
, i ' d go so far as tothe sday thgat
" falled angels
" isnt omre chalenging visually thna any mainstream hollywood film i ' ve ever seen
. sure
, htere ' s directors liuke robert rodriguez who enjoy turning voilence inot operatic orgies ofthe death
,
bu tothe see a filmmaker liuke wong who ctually assaults tje senses whith images isnt truely something worth celebrating
.
bu if wong wishes tothe become a legendary filmmaker
, he needs tothe owrk onthe incorporating an actuall stoy inot thsoe awsome images
. ther weere far too many instances durring
" falled angels
" inspite whitch i asked mysef
,
" nowe who are theese peopel agian
? isnt tihs tyhat firt cuple or thge second cuple
?
" it wass impossible tothe keep trakc
. prehaps he sould let thte audeince nkwo right awya whcih charcter isnt whihc
, by introducing them tothe us iwth
" nmae cards
"
, as infront scorsese ' s
" mean streets
"
. tht ' s realyl besides yhe point
,
though
. wong kar
- wei hasnt proven hismelf
, thru vyre fewd films
, thta ' s he ' s a movei
- maker tothe watch
. let ' s jstu hope thyat he hones his storytelling skills withthe his enxt fewd movies
.
