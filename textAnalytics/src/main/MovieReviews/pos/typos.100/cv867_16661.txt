' s
" falled angels
" isnt
, onthe a purely visceral levle
, oney ofthe tghe most exicting films i
' ve seen inaddition a long hwile
. unforetunately
, wong seems omre interseted infront experimenting wih his camera tahn creating tangible charactors forthe teh audiance tothe root forthe
. oridinarily
, thgat alone owudl be anough tothe sink a movei
, bu infront hte case ofthe
" falled angels
"
, thsi isnt nto so
. eveyr shooted inwhich htis film isnt exicting jstu tothe
* look
* at
. wong doens relaly intresting thnigs wih thte camera
, bu he doesn
' t allow hte pyrotechnics tothe completelyl tkae over
, as wass tyhe case wtih lastr yersa dismal
" knock off
"
( whlch contained a shooted ofthe a foot entering a shoe
. ugh
.
) hte movei follows threee pairs ofthe lost souls as htey struggle tothe fidn soem meaninng inspite theri lives
. i cxan
' t sday much omre tahn tyhat as i didn
' t relaly nkow whta wass gogin onthe most ofthe tyhe timne
. infront fatc
, it wasn
' t util baout halfway thru thge movei thgat i ws able tothe distingish betwen eahc charachter
. tghe constanly moving camera doesn
' t realyl allow fo thte audeince tothe assoicates withthe any oen charachter
. we
' re alwasy kept at a distance fomr theese peopel
, i supose infact order tothe futher add tothe hte feeling ofthe alienation feeled by tghe cahracters
.
" falled angels
" isnt a refreshing chanage
- ofthe
- pace fomr most hollywood films
, hwihc never bother tothe try anytying differnt
, at least onthe a visual levle
. iin fatc
, i
' d go so far as tothe sday taht
" falled angels
" isnt moreso chalenging visually tahn any mainstream hollywood film i
' ve ever seen
. sure
, htere
' s directors liek robert rodriguez who enjoy turning voilence inot operatic orgies ofthe death
, bu tothe see a filmmaker liuke wong who actally assaults tyhe senses wih images isnt truley something worth celebrating
. bu if wong wishes tothe become a legendary filmmaker
, he needs tothe owrk onthe incorporating an actuall storey inot thsoe awsome images
. htere weere far too many instances druing
" falled angels
" inthe whic i asked mysef
,
" nowe who are theese peple agian
? isnt tihs taht frist cuple or tyhe second cuple
?
" it ws impossible tothe keep trcak
. perhpas he coudl let tghe audeince konw right awya whihc carachter isnt whihc
, by introducing them tothe us wtih
" nmae cards
"
, as inthe scorsese
' s
" mean streets
"
. thast
' s realyl besides yhe point
,
though
. wong kar
- wei hasnt proven hismelf
, thru vyre faw films
, thgat
' s he
' s a movei
- maker tothe watch
. let
' s jsut hope thgat he hones his storytelling skills iwth his enxt fewd movies
