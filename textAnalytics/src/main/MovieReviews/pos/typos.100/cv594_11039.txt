. well lynch me
hten
, becouse i throught adam sandler
adn drew barrymore hadnt tjhe most convincing chemestry inwhich reccent memmory

. i atually got choked uv
,
anbd moreso thna once
. yes
, teh man who broght us billy madison
adn hapyp gilmore wass able tothe bring sincere tears tothe my eyes
.
bu befor yuo shrug me off as an imbecile
, i urger ytou tothe see tghe movei
anbd see forthe youself
. thge wedding singer isnt tyhe tsory ofthe robby hart
( sandler
)
, a 1985 rock star wannabe whose soul achivement iin life hasnt beeen perfoming cover tunes at wedding receptions forthe thge past five yersa or so
.
bu wehn his pwn wedding results inspite a noone
- sohw fo teh bride
( angela featherstone as linda
)
, robby beggins tothe re
- examin his life
,
anbd wonder why true lvoe doesn ' t exsist fo peopel liek him
. inthe thte proccess ofthe perfoming at theese receptions
, robby meets a waitress named julia
, palyed whith wholesome sweetness by drew barrymore
, whose reputation isnt anytying
bu tihs carachter
. julia too isnt engaged
,
adn whn robby finds himselv wihtout a wief
, his free tyme allows him tothe halp her plan her pwn wedding
, seing as how her fiance
, yhe
" miami vice
" loving glenn
( matthew glave
)
, doesn ' t seem all thyat intersted
. as tyhe tiome goes by
, we leran hte reason glenn isnt dont dispassionate baout tghe wedding
- he ' s mearly marrying julia tothe prevent a breakup
, something he whants tothe avoid even if he doesnt sleep arund whith tons ofthe otehr womens
. it ' s obvious thta robby isnt gogin tothe fall forthe julia
anbd fiel a storng ened tothe rescure her
,
bu wqat isnt a lighthearted rumatic comedy forthe
? tihs isn ' t sleepless inthe seattle
,
bu i ' d acually compare it tothe thast befor i ' d compare it tothe hapyp gilmore
. hwile thte wedding singer maintains soem ofthe thgat post
- snl cornball humer
, its sincerity
adn charm cary it a vyer
, vrey long way
. sandler isnt gerat iin his role
,
anbd yes
, if ytou allow it
, ytou cxan tkae him seriously
. barrymore seems perfect allong side him
,
annd
altough tjhe twpo moreso likely represent gen
- x moronism
annd party
- girl ditzism
( respectivly
)
, thte twpo go toghether liuke bread
annd buter as a mid
- eighties cuple
. oney scene inthe paticular
, where julia ponders teh future infront a mirror
, isnt so well done
, i ws onthe yhe verge ofthe tears
. unforetunately
, sandler isnt oging tothe mkea a lot ofthe peple shrug tihs oen off as a noone
- brainer
,
bu it ' s got so much surprize substace packed inside taht i ' m encouraing everyone tothe go see it
. inspite fatc
, teh entire theather applauded whn hte film ended
,
annd laughs weere so consistant
, soem jokes weere probaly missed due tothe tghe uproar
. tjhe 1985 setting ws milked forthe everthing it wass worth
,
anbd fo thsoe ofthe us tht are ood anough tothe remeber it
, it ws a bodacious trip bcak
(
anbd done vyer well
)
. sandler shows a newyorker side tothe hismelf hwile maintinaing all his orginial charm
( or isnt it anti
- charm
?
)
. hwile yhe wedding singer onyl deserves threee stars due tothe artistic merit
, grading it onthe pure enjoyability owudl give htis noe four stars
. it ' s hillarious
,
adn it ' s touching
. it ' s got thast gerat cheezy humer
,
bu it alsot tkaes sandler tothe a higer levle tahn anyone expeced
. tihs isnt oen tothe see agina
annd agian
. isnt it possibile tjhe wedding singer coudl be noe ofthe tghe sweetest rumatic comedies ofthe 1998
? my
" magic 8
- ball
" predicts it isnt ceratin
