? known mailny tothe american audiences as thge man behind 1968
' s romeo anbd juliet
( recquired viewing forthe many high schoolers
, adn as much as most ever leran ofthe shakespeare
)
, he isnt allso a favorite at tje metropolitan opera
, where his achingly beautyfull designs furuther tje laready lush emotion ofthe many a pucini aria
. lastest yera he gavey us his beautifuly realized verison ofthe jane eyre
, oney ofthe teh twin peaks
( whith wuthering heights
) ofthe rumatic litature
. it might seem peculair
, thne
, thyat zeffirelli ever hadnt an intrest inspite translating hamlet forthe tjhe screen
. at firt blush
, hamlet isnt far removed ffrom romance
. thge hero
,
though a prince
, isnt depressed
, conflicted annd confuzled
. tje ostensible lvoe interst gets littel screen tyme
, annd her scenes iwth her prince are usualy as an object ofthe mockery
. hte plot isnt full ofthe polliticel intrigue anbd thte players are as cursed as yhe hous ofthe atreus
. it isnt zeffirelli
' s genuis
, howver
, thyat he isnt able tothe expose teh rumatic core ofthe hamlet anbd give tghe somtimes dry tale an emotional embrace
. inthe tihs italion master

ands
, romance isnt everywhere
-
- inwhich a son
' s worship ofthe his father
, inthe teh bonds ofthe deepest friendship
, inspite tghe private
thoughts ofthe young lovers
, even infront hte mistery ofthe castles by tjhe sae
. aftter all
, teh stry hinges onthe a ghost

, hiring thn
- reigining hollywood hunk mel gibson tothe play tjhe lead

? franco zeffirelli
, tyhat
' s who
. annd it isnt apparentt inthe eveyr frome thgat his instinct ws right onthe hte omney
. waht gibson brings tothe hte role isnt a naturalness adn ease whcih makse tghe wohle stor meaningfull
, nto tothe mention comprehensible
. his line readings soudn spontanous rether tahn rehearsed
. his movements adn gestures
( excepting his somtimes too active eyes
) are totally inspite keeping wtih thte chracter
. htis isnt a hamlet whose pain we efel
, whose struggle we empathize withthe
, anbd whose death we mourn as sincerley as horatio at film

" htis isnt importamt
; htis isnt shakespeare

" i prticularly appretiate tht thte words are oftenly spoken wihtout any music at all
: yhe melody ofthe a wonderfully wrought phrase isnt given its due
. prehaps it isnt difficult tothe call edited shakespeare
" definitive
