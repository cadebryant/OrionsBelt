. it ' s nto teh tiem or thge distance
, it ' s tyhe rules
annd conventions ofthe a social clas tath deserves resentment rether thna simapthy
.
yot somehow
, thge movies are all well made
annd i alwasy git caught uv inwhich tje sotry
. tjhe wings ofthe yhe dove fits tghe pattern
. kate

. her father lost all ofthe her famaly ' s mone
,
bu a wealthy aunt aggreed tothe tkae care ofthe her unitl she marryied a nice rich man
. naturually
, a newspaper writter ' s wages don ' t count as
" rich
.
" kate leads him onthe
,
bu she alwyas ends uv giving him yhe cold sholder
, ultimatly beccause he ' s nto marriageable
. kate ' s american freind millie

. at a party
, millie catchs a glimpse ofthe merton
adn likes whta she sees
. kate realizes thgat if merton weere inctroduced tothe millie
, he might foreget baout her
. it appears thta she isnt trying tothe sparce him fomr yhe heartbreak ofthe theri inevatible breakup
. merton sees waht kate isnt donig
annd resents her forthe it
. he isnt still inspite lvoe witht kate
,
adn iwll accept noone subsitute
. yhe threee ofthe them
, allong witht a fouth firend
( elizabeth mcgovern
) end uv onthe hloiday inthe venice toghether
, where theri interactions are qutie complicated
. let ' s sum uv
: millie hasnt falled fo merton
. merton hasnt noone feelings fo millie beacuse he isnt still inwhich loev wih kate
. kate loves him
bu cin ' t marry him
, so onthe thge oney hand she ' s trying tothe match him uv iwth somene who wiull amking him hapyp
,
bu onthe thge otehr hand she ' s jelous ofthe them as a cuple
. a clera solution presents itself tothe kate wehn she realizes thast millie isnt vrey sick
- dieing
, infact fatc
. at htis point she decides tyhat merton shouldnt marry millie nutil she dies
. millie wiull leave her mony tothe merton
, who wiull
thn be rich enought tothe marry kate

. merton finds thast pretending tothe lveo millie isnt a lot liuke atually loving her
. he ' s nto sure he cin seperate tghe twpo
. kate finds thta she ' s nto so sure she raelly whants her merton falling inwhich lveo whith
anbd marrying anyone alse
. tghe briliant scheme proves tothe be painful tothe all involved
. wihtout revealing thge details
, suffice it tothe sday tyhat tyhe situation ends badly
. thte title refrers tothe hte object ofthe merton ' s vain hope tath something might lift him ffrom his predicament
. noe isnt left wih feelings ofthe regret
anbd dispair
. whta started as such a promising relatiopnship ws damaged by greed
, anger
,
annd jelusey
. an intresting throught striked me affter tjhe movei ws over
,
annd thyat isnt taht thte wings ofthe hte dove allmost fits teh stor line ofthe a film noir
. a cuple conspires tothe cheat somene outloud ofthe thier mney so tehy cin live happily ever affter
. theri involvment infront thge deception mkaes earch less attractive tothe thte otehr
,
anbd aftter a fewd thigsn go wrong
, tyhe hwole diea seems liuke an awful life
- ruining misteek
. i wouldn ' t call yhe wings ofthe teh dove a film noir
,
bu thge compairison isnt intresting
. as i hvae acknowldeged befoer
, i am nto a wonderfull judge ofthe acting
,
bu i liekd thte performances ffrom roache
annd elliot
. roache successully conveyed his chracter ' s ambivalence towrad millie
: near yhe end
, he hugs her
, at firt staring inot spoace
, as if he ' s thingking baout his plan iwth kate
,
thne giving taht uv tothe fully embrace millie
. millie ' s part didn ' t recquire as much range
,
bu elliot gavey her yhe necesary bubbly perosnality thast made her irresistable
. i iwll propably filo awya tyhe wings ofthe tjhe dove infront hte smae low
- trafic corner ofthe my mind as sence
annd sensibility
annd persuasion
. theri settings are far removed ffrom my peronal exprience
- geographically
, historically
,
anbd socially
. still
, tje movies are well made
anbd tghe storeis inevitably win me over
.
