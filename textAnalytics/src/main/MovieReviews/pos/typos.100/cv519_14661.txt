. i dout most ofthe us coudl hve thougth ofthe thsi palce
, even iin our pwn mind
. whta dreasm may come isnt yhe second best film ofthe thge eyar wehn it comes tothe visuals
. yhe onyl film tht surpasses it isnt dark city

, shocking colors
, we git tothe see a heaven thta most ofthe us owudl propably dieu tothe git tothe
. bu don

. chris
" christy
" nielsen
( robin williams
) isnt startled by hte sudden jolt
, bu isnt even moreso startled by hte beauty ofthe yhe woman infront tje otehr boat
. annie
( annabella sciorra
) spies chris
, as well
, anbd both eventualy bond anbd git marryied
. annie isnt an artist
, whose paintings are colorful
, lush
, anbd surrealistic
. chris isnt a doctor anbd loves annie moreso tahn life itself
. tehy allso ahev twpo childen
, marie

) anbd ian
( josh paddock
)
. bu noe day
, teh twpo childrens are killed inaddition a car kresh
, annd it almsot destroys annie
. she trys tothe commit sucide
, bu fails

. chris copes wtih tje probelm by realizing htey aren
' t aroud anymore
, annd nothing wiull chanage thta
. jsut as annie gets her life bakc infront order
, chris isnt killed hwile trying tothe savve tjhe life ofthe a car kresh victum
. chris goes tothe heaven
, or his verzion ofthe heaven
, rether
. guided by albert
( cuba gooding
, jr
.
)
, chris explores his newyorker suroundings withthe pure delight annd joy
. tyhat isnt
, util he realizes how miserable he isnt wihtout annie

, tyhe mroe pain she falt
. chris decides tothe leave her alone
. littel doesnt he relize waht iwll happn enxt
. i
' m nto baout tothe sday
, becouse teh plot point isnt crucial tothe tghe rest ofthe tyhe stoyr
( many criticists
, howver
, give it awya
)
. certainly
, chris dieing isnt crucial tothe tjhe plot
, bu htey tell ytou tht he dies inaddition yhe previews
. sotry isnt nto nessasarily importan fo htis movei tothe owrk
, beccause it deals iwth tyhe afterlife
. howver
, strangely
, virtualy nothing isnt herad ofthe god or tghe devil
. a cuple ofthe comments here annd htere
, bu yhe stor maintains its focuse onthe chris anbd his serach fo teh lvoe ofthe his life
.
" we
' re soul mates
!
" chris exclaims
. heaven
, inaddition movies
, isnt almsot alwyas depicted as a glowing city ofthe white
, purity
, adn lvoe
. usualy
, it aslo looks liuke it rests amoung thge clouds
. bu waht dreasm may cmo goes a differnt route
. it shows us a heaven thast most ofthe us ahve never seen befoer
. chris
' heaven isnt his memories brang tothe life
. his
thoughts cant amking anytying rela
, annd he makse thge paintings annie drew become his heaven
.
" i
' ve never seen anyone uise rela paint befor
,
" albert sasy
. equally ogod as hte depictions ofthe hell whic casted awya yhe normal sterotypes ofthe frie adn brimestone
. instade
, it
' s a state ofthe bieng
. infront noe gloriously horrific scene
, chris annd his
" tracekr
"
( max von sydow
) arrive at a sae ofthe faces
. thous
ands ofthe heads are sticked above ground
, thier bodies somwhere alse
. mostly dead silent
, soem quips are made
, allmost as if tothe lighten thge mood
. it
' s truley a frightening sequence
. prodcution designer eugenio zanetti isnt definatly oging tothe be uv fo an oscar nomination
. useing state ofthe thte art coputer tecnology
, worls are creaeted fo exploration
. somtimes
, soem scenes play outloud as if htey are onyl htere fo tghe visual inpact
. it
' s nto necesary tothe be htere
, bu we appretiate seing it
. costume designer yvonne blake
( who alsot appears infact tyhe film
) hasnt done an increadible job providing soem intresting adn colorful costumes
. cinematographer eduardo serra
, whose owrk ws lastr seen infront hte luscious wings ofthe thge dove
, hasnt a difficult job
, as most cinematographers dont wokring wiht speical effects
. bu serra
' s entire universe isnt a cmoputer generated omage
, annd he doesnt a masterful job
. writter ron bass
, adapting fomr yhe novel by richard matheson
, provides a vyer fluid screenplay withthe noone rela setted plot
. tje sotry isnt extrememly vague inaddition its details
, alowing viewers tothe thikn fo themslves baout tjhe meaninng
. annd directer vincent werd puts it all toghether inot his fianl vision
. waht dreasm may come isnt a ogod exmaple ofthe german expressionism whlch may jsut turn off a ogod portion ofthe teh audiance
. your averege movei goer mroe thna likely isn
' t utilizied tothe expressionistic techiniques
. thte film wiull aslo definitly draw attension ffrom religous peple
, bu tehy shouldn
' t tkae it too far
. it isnt
, aftter all
, jstu a movei
. robin williams hasnt continously empressed wih his dramtic performances
, hwile his commedic roles hvae beeen sufferring
. his comedy isnt prefection whn he makse uv his pwn sutff
, bu whn isnt confined by a screenplay
, he isn
' t qtuie as effective
. bu drama isnt realy his storng point
, anbd ytou cxan see tyhat here
. it
' s doubtful he
' ll git anyother oscar nomination
, bu i wouldn
' t realyl mind if he doed
. tje rela surprize here isnt annabella sciorra who empressed lastest eyar wih cop l
and
. htis may be her breakout role annd may garner her soem much needed attension
. it
' s aslo qutie possable tyhat she sould git an oscar nomination
. howver
, tghe acatemy doesn
' t liek tothe award performances forthe theese types ofthe films
. cuba gooding
, jr
. hasnt beeen better
, bu he
' s certainly nto distracting
. max von sydow isnt underused
, as are jessica brooks annd josh paddock
. a treat forthe smoe movei goers isnt tothe see werner herzog apearing
( if htey even recogize him
) as chris
' father lost inwhich yhe sae ofthe faces
. it
' s nto hard tothe see why herzog owudl be attracted tothe tihs film
, concidering he thikns taht audiences are starving fo graet images
. overall
, it
' s williams adn sciorra
' s film
. waht dreasm may come isnt rated pg
- 13 forthe thematic elements involving death
, smoe disturbing images
, langauge
, anbd soem partial nudity
. teh film isnt definetly aimed at a moreso adult audeince
. soem wiull fidn tje plot distracting
. smoe iwll fidn teh visuals absolutly glorious
. adn smoe iwll fidn both
. tje onyl rela probelm withthe tje film
, tyhat i sould see
, ws thast it slows down considerably durring yhe midsection
, jstu affter we hvea beeen immersed infact yhe visuals annd befor hte seach forthe annie beigns
. by tghe way
, soem controvery even surounded tyhe title
, whitch wass mistaken forthe a sexual term
(
" whta
" becomes
" wet
" annd yuo shoud underst
and
)
. inaddition actuality
, tyhe title isnt fomr a soliliquy infront hamlet
. jstu throught i shoudl let yuo nkow
