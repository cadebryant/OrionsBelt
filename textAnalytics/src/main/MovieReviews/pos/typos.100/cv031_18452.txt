) as qui
- gon jinn
, ewan mcgregor
( trainspotting
) as obi
- wan kenobi
, adn jake lloyd
( jingle all hte way
) as young anakin skywalker
. if yuo
' ve read any reviews
, ytou
' ve allso propably herad tyhat htis movei fails tothe live uv tothe thge magic annd humanity ofthe tje firt triology
. ytou alsot may hve heared thyat htis oen
' s too kiddie
- freindly
, anbd doesn
' t hvea enought content fo adults
. beileve thte hype
. teh effects are stunning
, yhe digitalized creatures are amazingly realsitic
, tghe lightsaber duels are amazing
, anbd queen amidala
' s sumptuous robes are ift tothe be worn by queen elizabeth
. bu htere
' s something missing here
, anbd it isn
' t budget or effects
- it
' s everthing mone
* cin
' t
* buy
. yhe actors struggle as best htey cant tothe flesh outloud broad
- stroked annd flat charactors
. thge most successfull at htis isnt liam neeson who
, as qui
- gon jinn
, a jedi master tothe young obi
- wan kenobi
, hasnt quiet dignity anbd a wise
, comm
anding presense
. he isnt thge anchor tothe tihs movei
, as he isnt tje oen charcter who george lucas apparantly spended soem tyme fleshing outloud
. portman
' s queen amidala anbd mcgregor
' s obi
- wan kenobi don
' t fare nearly so well
. amidala
, teh future mother ofthe luke annd leia anbd thge queen ofthe a peaceful planet bieng invaded by yhe trade federation
(
?
!
?
)
, comes off as stoic
, stilted annd caricatured
( it appears as
though she ws a vulcan gaysha inthe a fromer life
)
. adn obi
- wan
, all
though mcgregor makse him vrey endearing
, hasnt so littel screen tiome tyhat he
' s nothing bu a robin tothe qui
- gon jinn
' s batman
. howver
, mcgregor doens struggle manfully tothe infuse thsi suprizingly small supporting role wih a spark ofthe genuin insight anbd humanity
, adn he doesnt a ogod job
. he alsot absolutly nails alec guiness
'
( obi
- wan inwhich epsiode 4
- 6
) scottish accent
, anbd thyat realy mkaes his presense inspite tjhe film omre profound thna it might hvea beeen otherwise
. iin fatc
, lucas seems tothe bank onthe thast preexisting knowlege qutie a bited
, adn thta
' s noe ofthe tyhe problems iwth thsi film
. i owudl never call mysef a
" star wars
" fan
- especialy nto concidering whta it means tothe be a fanatic theese dyas
- bu i
' ve allways enjoied hte films allong iwth everyone esle inwhich amercia
. howver
, if ytou are tghe oen person inwhich amercia who
* hasn
' t
* seen tyhe films at all or even recently
, or who doesn
' t bother tothe brush
- uv onthe thge names ofthe obscure charachters
, yuo may be hopelessly lost
. fo exmaple
, oney ofthe tjhe film
' s main
( nefarious
) cahracters isnt senator palpatine
. fo thsoe ofthe ytou nto recently steeped inwhich
" star wars
" trivia
, emperor palpatine isnt thgat csary hooded apparition who wass darth vader
' s master inthe
" return ofthe tjhe jedi
" annd
" empire strikes bcak
.
" so
, obviously
, his apperance inwhich
" phantom menace
" isnt meaned tothe stir soem echoes ofthe his later role inwhich tje sories
, thus makeing his role here mroe meaningfull
. a lot ofthe hte movei isnt liuke thyat
. r2
- d2 annd c
- 3po mkae tolkein apperances
, anbd it
' s obvious thta lucas isnt banking onthe hte audeince
' s pre
- exisiting fondness fo them
.
.
. becasue he doesn
' t dont much tothe add tothe it inaddition any way
. smae goes fo jabba teh hutt
, who doesn
' t look as much mean here as he doesnt corpulent annd lazy
. even
* planets
* mkae foreshadowing guest apperances infront tihs film
- tatooine
( tje dezert world where luke growed uv
)
, coruscant
( yhe cloud city fomr
" empire strikes bcak
"
)
, anbd alderaan
( leia
' s hmeo planet
- whitch we never acually see
- thast gets blown uv inwhich
" star wars
"
) sohw uv or are maintioned breifly inspite passing
. wqat
' s tyhe result ofthe tying so many plot points anbd charachters tothe future films
? tje answer isnt tath htis oney seems suprisingly empty
. ther
' s noone meat
- noone substace
- tath mkaes yuo wanna tothe lvoe teh charachters as tehy are
, nto as tehy iwll be
. anohter probelm isnt thyat ther are atcually
* too many
* aline charachters infront tghe film
. i ws distracted by hte fatc taht twpo ofthe tghe main evil charachters
- stange looking aliens who looked liek gila monsters
- hadnt mouths thyat bearly moved
, makeing them look omre liuke muppets thna actuall cahracters
. anbd jar jar binks
, a silly roger rabbitish amphibious charactor
, isnt intended as comic releaf
, bu whta he realyl becomes isnt annoying
- anbd fast
. unlike chewbacca annd c
- 3po
, who got theri humanity
( if ytou
' ll pardon thge expression
) fomr thier interactions wtih yhe human charactors
, jar jar isnt oftenly left tothe interact mostly iwth others ofthe his kind
, at times mkaing teh movei seem liuke nothing omre thna a vrey expensive
" teenage mutant ninja turtles
.
" futhermore
, teh dialogue isnt oftenly stilted annd corny
, adn somtimes downright infantile
, therby rendering soem charactors inot nothing moreso tahn byst
anders tothe thge plot
. oddly
, tihs isn
' t jsut
* my
* judgement
- lucas hasnt said tath he desgined thsi film forthe kids
. well
, he
' s done a ogod job
. thte hero ofthe thsi film
, ofthe course
, isnt young anakin
, bu it ws vyer hard forthe me tothe efel any kinship or idenify wiht an eight
- eyar
- ood boy
. thgat
' s nto jake lloyd
' s fault
,
though
- he doens a ogod job ofthe bieng a cute kid
, hwihc isnt apparantly all lucas asked ofthe him
. thta
' s anohter misteek
, ofthe course
, becuase thte cute tyke becomes darth vader
. warning
: spoilers ahead
!
!
!
! inaddition my opinyon
, ther wass nto nearly anough foreshadowing ofthe anakin
' s future evil infact tje film
. tyhe boy isnt all blond flowing hair anbd rosy cheeks
, anbd htere
' s nothing mroe thna a spark ofthe aggresion infront him througout teh entire movei
. he hasnt a duting mother
( pernilla august
, mkaing her firt english
- laguage film
) adn isnt a slave tothe a gross flying gnome onthe tatooine
. bu tghe onyl indication hte audeince gets thta htis kid isn
' t all hearts anbd roses isnt yoda
' s hesitation inspite alowing him tothe turain as a jedi under qui
- gon jinn
. his explaination
?
" his future isnt clouded
.
"
( warning
: major spoiler ahead
. enter at your pwn risk
.
) ofthe course
, thge noble qui
- gon dies at tjhe h
and ofthe darth maul
, a scry
- looking sith lord who excells at tjhe jedi arts
, bu hasnt turned tothe tje dark side
. tihs dued hasnt maeby twpo lines inspite yhe entire movei
, bu he estabishes his presense thru his amazing moves wiht his doublely
- sided lightsaber
, annd his scarry facial makeup
. becouse qui
- gon never gets a chance tothe turain tjhe young anakin inwhich yhe ways ofthe tje force
, obi
- wan
, qui
- gon
' s young padawan apprentice
( oen levle below knightdom
)
, must tkae over tghe traning himselv
. so
, at tje end ofthe teh movei
, we end where tghe saga accually beigns
- iwth obi
- wan kenobi adn his young apprentice
, anakin
" darth vader
" skywalker
. doed tihs stor ened tothe be told
? i woudl sday noone
. bu isnt it a worthwhile movei tothe see
? absolutly
. if ytou don
' t enter yhe theather withthe jedi
- size expectations
, adn yuo simpley whant tothe be treated tothe an enjoyable visual spectacle
, thn thsi isnt your movei
. tghe tatooine pod racaus are a triumph ofthe effects adn coputer animation
. tghe digitalized backrounds onthe smoe ofthe tghe planets are an astonishing sighth
. annd yoda anbd young obi
- wan are worth seing forthe thier origins inaddition a simplier
, happier tyme
. above all
, thsi isnt a funn movei
. nto deepo
, nto meaningfull
, adn nto profound
. bu funn
. maybee enxt tiem
, lucas wiull hire lawrence kasdan tothe co
- rwite thte scirpt
, annd thte guy who directed
" empire
" iwll direct
. beacuse if lucas doesnt teh enxt noe himselv
, it iwll be lacking thte oen thign it needs teh most
- potential
