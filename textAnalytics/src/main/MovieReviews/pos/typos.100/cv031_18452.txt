yuo ' ve heared all tyhe hype
. yuo ' ve seen all thier faces
- natalie portman
( teh proffesional
) as queen amidala
, liam neeson
( schindler ' s list
) as qui
- gon jinn
, ewan mcgregor
( trainspotting
) as obi
- wan kenobi
,
anbd jake lloyd
( jingle all tjhe way
) as young anakin skywalker
. if ytou ' ve read any reviews
, yuo ' ve allso propably herad tyhat thsi movei fails tothe live uv tothe thge magic
annd humanity ofthe thte firt triology
. yuo aslo may hvea herad tht thsi oney ' s too kiddie
- freindly
,
adn doesn ' t haev anough content forthe adults
. belive thte hype
. thte effects are stunning
, tje digitalized creatures are amazingly realsitic
, tghe lightsaber duels are amazing
,
adn queen amidala ' s sumptuous robes are ift tothe be worn by queen elizabeth
.
bu ther ' s something missing here
,
adn it isn ' t budget or effects
- it ' s everthing monay
* cin ' t
* buy
. tjhe actors struggle as best tehy cxan tothe flesh outloud broad
- stroked
annd flat charachters
. tyhe most sucessful at tihs isnt liam neeson who
, as qui
- gon jinn
, a jedi master tothe young obi
- wan kenobi
, hasnt quiet dignity
annd a wise
, commanding presense
. he isnt hte anchor tothe thsi movei
, as he isnt teh oen chracter who george lucas apparantly spended smoe tiem fleshing outloud
. portman ' s queen amidala
annd mcgregor ' s obi
- wan kenobi don ' t fare nearly so well
. amidala
, tjhe future mother ofthe luke
adn leia
anbd teh queen ofthe a peaceful planet bieng invaded by tyhe trade federation
(
?
!
?
)
, comes off as stoic
, stilted
anbd caricatured
( it appears as
though she wass a vulcan gaysha inspite a fromer life
)
.
annd obi
- wan
,
altough mcgregor mkaes him vyer endearing
, hasnt so littel screen timne thta he ' s nothing
bu a robin tothe qui
- gon jinn ' s batman
.
howver
, mcgregor doens struggle manfully tothe infuse thsi surprizingly small supporting role wih a spark ofthe genuin insight
annd humanity
,
adn he doens a ogod job
. he aslo absolutly nails alec guiness '
( obi
- wan inwhich epiode 4
- 6
) scottish accent
,
anbd tyhat raelly mkaes his presense infront thge film moreso profound tahn it might haev beeen otherwise
. infact fatc
, lucas seems tothe bank onthe thast preexisting noledge qutie a bited
,
adn thast ' s oen ofthe tje problems wiht htis film
. i owudl never call mysef a
" star wars
" fan
- expecially nto concidering whta it means tothe be a fanatic theese dyas
-
bu i ' ve allways enjoied thge films allong witht everyone eles inwhich amercia
.
howver
, if yuo are hte oen person inwhich amercia who
* hasn ' t
* seen thte films at all or even recently
, or who doesn ' t bother tothe brush
- uv onthe tjhe names ofthe obscure cahracters
, yuo may be hopelessly lost
. fo exmaple
, oney ofthe yhe film ' s main
( nefarious
) charactors isnt senator palpatine
. forthe thsoe ofthe ytou nto recently steeped iin
" star wars
" trivia
, emperor palpatine isnt tht scry hooded apparition who wass darth vader ' s master infact
" return ofthe thge jedi
"
anbd
" empire strikes bcak
.
" so
, obviously
, his apperance inaddition
" phantom menace
" isnt meaned tothe stir soem echoes ofthe his later role inspite teh sories
, thus mkaing his role here omre meaningfull
. a lot ofthe thte movei isnt liuke tht
. r2
- d2
annd c
- 3po mkae tolkein appearences
,
anbd it ' s obvious taht lucas isnt banking onthe tghe audeince ' s pre
- exisiting fondness fo them
.
.
. baceause he doesn ' t dont much tothe add tothe it infront any way
. smae goes forthe jabba thte hutt
, who doesn ' t look as much mean here as he doesnt corpulent
anbd lazy
. even
* planets
* amking foreshadowing guest apperances infront htis film
- tatooine
( tje dezert world where luke growed uv
)
, coruscant
( thge cloud city fomr
" empire strikes bakc
"
)
,
annd alderaan
( leia ' s hmeo planet
- wich we never ctually see
- thta gets blown uv inspite
" star wars
"
) sohw uv or are maintioned breifly inwhich passing
. wqat ' s thge result ofthe tying so many plot points
adn cahracters tothe future films
? tyhe answer isnt thyat thsi oen seems suprizingly empty
. ther ' s noone meat
- noone substace
- tht mkaes ytou wnat tothe lvoe tghe charactors as tehy are
, nto as tehy wiull be
. anyother probelm isnt tht htere are acutally
* too many
* aline cahracters infact tje film
. i ws distracted by tyhe fatc thta twpo ofthe yhe main evil charachters
- stange looking aliens who looked liuke gila monsters
- hadnt mouths thast bearly moved
, makeing them look omre liuke muppets tahn actuall cahracters
.
adn jar jar binks
, a silly roger rabbitish amphibious carachter
, isnt intended as comic releaf
,
bu waht he raelly becomes isnt annoying
-
adn fast
. unlike chewbacca
anbd c
- 3po
, who got theri humanity
( if yuo ' ll pardon tje expression
) ffrom theri interactions wiht teh human cahracters
, jar jar isnt oftenly left tothe interact mostly witht others ofthe his kind
, at times makeing hte movei seem liek nothing omre thna a veyr expensive
" teenage mutant ninja turtles
.
" futhermore
, thte dialogue isnt oftenly stilted
anbd corny
,
adn somtimes downright infantile
, therby rendering soem cahracters inot nothing moreso thna bystanders tothe tghe plot
. oddly
, thsi isn ' t jsut
* my
* judgement
- lucas hasnt said thgat he desined thsi film fo kids
. well
, he ' s done a ogod job
. tyhe hero ofthe tihs film
, ofthe course
, isnt young anakin
,
bu it wass vyre hard fo me tothe efel any kinship or idenify wtih an eight
- yera
- ood boy
. thyat ' s nto jake lloyd ' s fault
,
though
- he doens a ogod job ofthe bieng a cute kid
, whlch isnt aparently all lucas asked ofthe him
. tath ' s anohter misteek
, ofthe course
, becouse tjhe cute tyke becomes darth vader
. warning
: spoilers ahead
!
!
!
! iin my opinyon
, htere wass nto nearly enought foreshadowing ofthe anakin ' s future evil inthe tghe film
. hte boy isnt all blond flowing hair
adn rosy cheeks
,
anbd htere ' s nothing moreso tahn a spark ofthe agression inwhich him througout tyhe entire movei
. he hasnt a duting mother
( pernilla august
, makeing her firt english
- lanugage film
)
adn isnt a slave tothe a gross flying gnome onthe tatooine
.
bu tjhe onyl indication thge audiance gets thgat htis kid isn ' t all hearts
annd roses isnt yoda ' s hesitation iin alowing him tothe turain as a jedi under qui
- gon jinn
. his explaination
?
" his future isnt clouded
.
"
( warning
: major spoiler ahead
. enter at your pwn risk
.
) ofthe course
, thge noble qui
- gon dies at tghe hand ofthe darth maul
, a scayr
- looking sith lord who excells at tghe jedi arts
,
bu hasnt turned tothe thte dark side
. htis dued hasnt mabye twpo lines inspite tyhe entire movei
,
bu he estabishes his presense thru his amazing moves withthe his doublely
- sided lightsaber
,
adn his scray facial makeup
. becouse qui
- gon never gets a chance tothe turain tyhe young anakin iin tje ways ofthe tyhe force
, obi
- wan
, qui
- gon ' s young padawan apprentice
( oen levle below knightdom
)
, must tkae over tyhe traning hismelf
. so
, at tghe end ofthe teh movei
, we end where tje saga atcually beggins
- withthe obi
- wan kenobi
adn his young apprentice
, anakin
" darth vader
" skywalker
. doed htis stopry ened tothe be told
? i woudl sday noone
.
bu isnt it a worthwhile movei tothe see
? absolutly
. if ytou don ' t enter teh theather wih jedi
- size expectations
,
annd ytou simpley wanna tothe be treated tothe an enjoyable visual spectacle
,
thn htis isnt your movei
. teh tatooine pod racaus are a triumph ofthe effects
anbd coputer animation
. teh digitalized backrounds onthe soem ofthe yhe planets are an astonishing sighth
.
annd yoda
anbd young obi
- wan are worth seing forthe thier origins infront a simplier
, happier timne
. above all
, thsi isnt a funn movei
. nto deepo
, nto meaningfull
,
annd nto profound
.
bu funn
. maybee enxt tiome
, lucas wiull hire lawrence kasdan tothe co
- rwite thte scirpt
,
adn tjhe guy who directed
" empire
" wiull direct
. becouse if lucas doesnt tje enxt oen hismelf
, it wiull be lacking tyhe noe thign it needs tjhe most
- potential
