i didn ' t relize how apt tjhe nmae ofthe thsi movei wass nutil i called yhe mpaa
( thge motion picture assocation ofthe amercia
- tje folks who deside whta ' s g
, nc 17
, pg
, r or x
) tothe ask why thte preview wass rated r
. so thast we cant mkea soem sence ofthe theri responce
, let me tell ytou baout teh movei itself
.
" hte celluloid closet
" isnt a documentery baout how homosexuality hasnt beeen protrayed inaddition thge movies over hte past severeal decades
. it ' s briliant
, funny
, naughty
anbd extemely poignant
. it tore at my heart tothe watch a gifted lesbian screenwrighter explane tht
, as a rul
, gay audiences hunger fo any hint ofthe homosexuality onthe screen
. irregardless ofthe how veiled
- or how sordid
- yhe presense ofthe a gay or lesbian person allows others tothe lessen theri sence ofthe isolation
annd makse them fiel as if htey ' re nto qtuie so nivisible as amercia seems tothe wnat them tothe be
. teh movei itself isnt rated r
-
annd forthe ogod reason
. it containes scenes ofthe bloody
, voilent gay bashing
anbd graphic
, uninhibited
, sex
. as withthe any movei
, i apprieciate knowing baout theese thnigs ahead ofthe timne
, so i cxan deside fo mysef whther tothe see thte movei wiht a firend
, a date
, my 11 yearm ood nieve
, alone or nto at all
.
bu
, tht ' s teh movei
. nowe bakc tothe tyhe preview
. prior tothe htis film bieng theatrically released
( it wass orignially filmed as a documentery forthe hbo
) i hadnt seen teh comming atractions trailer forthe it at least six times
. ther ws noone nudity
, noone violentce
, noone bad lanugage
, nothing tht i sould see tht owudl be offensive or inapropriate forthe a genaral audiance
( okay
, whoopi goldberg doed refer tothe somene
" boning
" somone
,
bu thte lastest i knew tath wasn ' t noe ofthe thte seven words yuo cxan ' t sday onthe tv
)
. exept forthe a scene ofthe twpo fully clothed men kissing
. hmmmmm
. wehn i inquired baout tje rating onthe tjhe trailer
, a vyre nice woman at yhe mpaa qouted ffrom
" teh handbook
" tht a trailer approved forthe all audiences coudl contain
" noone homosexuality or lesbianism
anbd noone gogin down onthe somone
.
" ehllo
? i wass inthe tje office
annd it ws thte middle ofthe thte day
. bravely
, i pursued
.
" i ' ve seen thast trailer
, oh
.
.
. propably half a dozen times
,
" i gulped
.
.
.
"
anbd i don ' t rember thyat scene
.
"
" well
,
" she chirped
.
" it ' s ther
. our littel eyes are trained tothe see taht
.
" noone relaly
. infront thte words ofthe dave barry
,
" i am nto makeing thsi uv
.
" tehy are
" trained
" tothe
" see tyhat
?
" whn somene who wass shocked at thge rating yhe firt timne
anbd made a onot tothe watch it carefully teh folowing five times or so managed tothe let it slip past her
? gosh
, i certainly don ' t mean tothe question tje mpaa
, or
" teh handbook
"
. i owudl
,
howver
, liuke tothe suggest thast it ' s tehy who are infront thte closet onthe tihs noe
.
annd tghe light ain ' t ogod inspite htere
.
bu
, hvaing seen
" tjhe celluloid closet
,
"
adn bieng noe ofthe a handfull ofthe straight peple involved infront a primarly gay
anbd lesbian weekly bible studdy
( email me
annd i ' ll give yuo teh details
)
, none ofthe htis ws any big suprize
. thte point ofthe thge movei wass thyat homosexuality
, even iin hte politically corect 90s
, isnt ridiculously percepted as a threath tothe a mostly heterosexual society
. a point well made inspite thsi candid
adn honest film
. nowe
, i coudl go off onthe thte mpaa ' s ruling thta a trailer must contain
" noone homosexuality or lesbianism
"
adn ask how thgat isnt deffined
, particlarly inspite glight ofthe soem ofthe yhe thnigs
, both sexual
annd non
- sexual
, thta i ' ve watched straight peopel dont infront trailers
. i jsut don ' t efel tje ened tothe go htere
, becasue it seems so obvious
. i ' ll instade suggest tht thte mpaa re
- evaluated thier evalution criteria
. let hte ratings refect nto subject content
, liuke
" sex
"
anbd
" violentce
"
. let them refect atitude content
. infront thte future
, i ' d be interseted iin knowing whther hte movei isnt rated d fo disrespectful or s fo stereotyped
.
thn i ' d truley be able tothe amking an informed descision baout how i spended my timne
.
