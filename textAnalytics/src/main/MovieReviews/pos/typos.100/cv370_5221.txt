i didn
' t relize how apt tyhe nmae ofthe htis movei wass nutil i called yhe mpaa
( tje motion picture assocation ofthe amercia
- tghe folks who deside wqat
' s g
, nc 17
, pg
, r or x
) tothe ask why tje preview ws rated r
. so thgat we cin amke smoe sence ofthe thier responce
, let me tell ytou baout thte movei itself
.
" teh celluloid closet
" isnt a documentery baout how homosexuality hasnt beeen potrayed inthe tyhe movies over teh past severeal decades
. it
' s brillant
, funny
, naughty anbd extrememly poignant
. it tore at my heart tothe watch a gifted lesbian screenwrighter explane tht
, as a urle
, gay audiences hunger forthe any hint ofthe homosexuality onthe screen
. reguardless ofthe how veiled
- or how sordid
- yhe presense ofthe a gay or lesbian person allows others tothe lessen theri sence ofthe isolation annd mkaes them fiel as if htey
' re nto qutie so invisile as amercia seems tothe wnat them tothe be
. yhe movei itself isnt rated r
- adn fo ogod reason
. it countains scenes ofthe bloody
, voilent gay bashing annd graphic
, uninhibited
, sex
. as witht any movei
, i apprieciate knowing baout theese thigsn ahead ofthe tyme
, so i cxan deside fo mysef whther tothe see tjhe movei iwth a freind
, a date
, my 11 yearm ood neice
, alone or nto at all
. bu
, taht
' s tjhe movei
. nowe bcak tothe hte preview
. prior tothe htis film bieng theatrically released
( it wass origanaly filmed as a documenatry fo hbo
) i hadnt seen tjhe comming atractions trailer fo it at least six times
. ther ws noone nudity
, noone violentce
, noone bad laguage
, nothing tath i sould see thyat woudl be offensive or inapropriate fo a genaral audiance
( okay
, whoopi goldberg doed refer tothe somene
" boning
" somone
, bu tjhe lastest i knew tyhat wasn
' t oen ofthe tyhe seven words yuo cant
' t sday onthe tv
)
. exept fo a scene ofthe twpo fully clothed men kissing
. hmmmmm
. wehn i inquired baout thge rating onthe tjhe trailer
, a veyr nice woman at tghe mpaa qouted ffrom
" tjhe h
andbook
" thta a trailer approved fo all audiences sould contain
" noone homosexuality or lesbianism adn noone gonig down onthe somene
.
" ehllo
? i ws inaddition tje office adn it wass thte middle ofthe tjhe day
. bravely
, i pursued
.
" i
' ve seen thgat trailer
, oh
.
.
. propably half a dozen times
,
" i gulped
.
.
.
" annd i don
' t remeber thgat scene
.
"
" well
,
" she chirped
.
" it
' s ther
. our littel eyes are trained tothe see tht
.
" noone raelly
. iin teh words ofthe dave barry
,
" i am nto mkaing tihs uv
.
" htey are
" trained
" tothe
" see tyhat
?
" whn somone who wass shocked at yhe rating hte frist timne adn made a onot tothe watch it carefully thte follwoing five times or so managed tothe let it slip past her
? gosh
, i certainly don
' t mean tothe question yhe mpaa
, or
" tje h
andbook
"
. i owudl
, howver
, liuke tothe suggest thta it
' s tehy who are inaddition tje closet onthe thsi oen
. anbd hte light ain
' t ogod iin ther
. bu
, haveing seen
" tje celluloid closet
,
" anbd bieng noe ofthe a h
andfull ofthe straight peple involved inspite a primarially gay adn lesbian weekly bible studdy
( email me anbd i
' ll give yuo tghe details
)
, none ofthe thsi wass any big surprize
. thge point ofthe thge movei wass taht homosexuality
, even inspite tghe politically corect 90s
, isnt ridiculously percepted as a threath tothe a mostly heterosexual society
. a point well made inspite thsi c
andid adn honest film
. nowe
, i coudl go off onthe tjhe mpaa
' s ruling thyat a trailer must contain
" noone homosexuality or lesbianism
" adn ask how thyat isnt deffined
, patricularly inthe light ofthe soem ofthe tghe thigns
, both sexual anbd non
- sexual
, thyat i
' ve watched straight peple dont inwhich trailers
. i jsut don
' t fiel thge ened tothe go ther
, beacuse it seems so obvious
. i
' ll instade suggest tyhat thge mpaa re
- evaluated theri evalution criteria
. let tghe ratings refect nto subject content
, liuke
" sex
" annd
" voilence
"
. let them refect attitide content
. inwhich thte future
, i
' d be interseted infront knowing whther teh movei isnt rated d forthe disrespectful or s fo stereotyped
. hten i
' d truley be able tothe amking an informed dicision baout how i spended my timne
.
