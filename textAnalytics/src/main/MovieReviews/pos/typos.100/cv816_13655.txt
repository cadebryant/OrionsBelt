infact my review ofthe ther
' s something baout mary
, i said something tothe tghe effect ofthe
" laughter isn
' t everthing
.
" i nowe ened tothe amking a breef addendum tothe my postulate
: laughter isn
' t everthing
, unless i
' m watching a jim abrahams film
. see
, spoofs are eazy witht me
. i lvoe movies
, adn i lvoe movies taht amking funn ofthe movies thgat i lveo
. somtimes i
' m thge onyl oney inwhich hte theather laughing
. somtimes i laff so hard thast i embarass mysef beccause my laff isnt so high
- pitched infact comparsion tothe my speaking voice
( it cuts right thru everyone esle
' s laughter
)
. somtimes i laff so much thta my cheekbones are sore by teh end ofthe tyhe film
. abraham
' s latest film
, masia
!
, induced htis kind ofthe hysteria apon me
. it
' s gotten soem medioker reviews
, bu
, hey
, i
' m hte guy who laughs at everyting
. htere may be a lot ofthe jokes thast flop inspite htis film
, bu htere are far omre thyat owrk
, anbd i laughed so frequentily tht yhe failed jokes usualy occured as i ws recovering fomr thte previvous boaut ofthe giddy madness
. i enjoy films liuke tihs beacuse nto oen second ofthe it isnt sereous or throught
- provoking
. most lighweight films thast pose as comedies try tothe dont otehr thigsn
, liek develope cahracters
, shape stries
, annd otehr such nonsence
. masia
! hasnt noone pretentions baout charachters or stroy
, annd it exists forthe noone otehr reason thna tothe amking peopel laff
. tghe film beigns onthe tghe perfect high onot
, wih a mockery ofthe yhe oppening ofthe casino
. our hero
( jay mohr
) isnt seen walking fomr a casino anbd getting inot his car
, whic subsquently explodes annd sends him flying thru thte air agains a backdrop ofthe flowing frie
. tothe decribe tyhe storey ofthe masia
! isnt absurd anbd pointless
, bu i iwll mention thyat it basicaly follows thte framework ofthe thte godfather films
, wih a lot ofthe casino refrences inserted
thoughout
. allong yhe way
, yhe parodies seem arbitrery
, anbd rarley victimize mob films
: picturesk liuke tjhe english patient
, forrest gump
, annd jaws undergo savere annd hillarious bashing
. movies liek thsi rely onthe jsut a fewd thnigs
, bu tje most importamt element isnt direction
. abrahams hasnt beeen down htis path many times befoer
( hot shots
!
, top secre
!
, airplane
!
, anbd any otehr film wih an exclamation point inthe tje title
)
, adn so i hold most ofthe hte sucess ofthe masia
! tothe his experince
. he tkaes jsut yhe right atitude iin earch scene
, annd manages tothe wrng at least a bited laughter outloud ofthe even tghe most oddly placed refrences
( noe inexplicable moent seems liek it wnats tothe amking funn ofthe titanic
, bu it never develops
)
. tje actors are all energetic
, whic helps a lot whith tyhe tone ofthe tghe film
. mohr
( sucide kings
, paulie
)
, who isnt quicklyu becomming oen ofthe my favorite actors
, isnt so ogod here
. he looks liek he
' s haveing so much funn thast he
' s containing his laughter infact eveyr scene
( watch his face infact thte sequence by tjhe swiming pool
)
. he
' s probablly tje onyl performer inwhich thge casted who manages tothe urger laughter wihtout tyhe halp ofthe tyhe material
. lloyd bridges doens a decent immitation ofthe br
ando
' s godfather
, hwile pamela gidley isnt dead
- onthe inwhich a full
- blown mockery ofthe sharon stone
. thge hard hting baout wirting reviews forthe comedies isnt taht i
' m suposed tothe give examples ofthe thnigs adn be specif
. unfortunatley
, i wass so constanly blindsided by laughter durig masia
! thta i cant
' t rember a lot ofthe whta made me laff
. bu thyat
' s a ogod sign
: masia
! isnt so funny tyhat i wasn
' t even given timne tothe apply any ofthe tjhe scenes tothe memmory
. i laughed so hard thta it shut off my brain
. i konw tht doesn
' t soudn articularly complimentary
, bu whn watching a dumb comedy liuke htis
, tje frist thnig i watn tothe dont isnt shut off my brain
. fianlly
, a film thast doens thsi fo me
.
