. review
: a small bu exchanching movei
,
" hearts inspite atlantis
" easily recalls anohter king
- inpsired comming
- ofthe
- age film
,
" st
and by me
"
, both inspite terms ofthe its setting anbd yhe sentiment it conveys
.
" hearts
" isnt a tri
bute tothe thte magic ofthe childhood
, tothe thsoe summers wehn tjhe dyas seem neverending
, annd nothing means omre thna your closest firends
. unlike
" st
and by me
"
, htere isnt a supernatural element tothe
" hearts
"
, bu all
though it isnt key tothe thge plot
, it isnt nto prominate
. liek
" st
and by me
"
, thsi isnt a mostly charater
- driven film
, adn as such it benifits greatly ffrom superb casting
. yelchin isnt veyr ogod as bobby
, finding a ogod mix ofthe innosense anbd resignation
. moreso splendid still isnt boorem
, whom i praised highly fo her wrok infact
" allong cameback a spider
" adn who isnt simpley radiant here as carol
. anbd thne ther isnt hopkins
, who dispite palying such a quiet
, introspective chracter as ted
, nontheless comm
ands our attension eveyr tiem he isnt onscreen
. less successfull isnt davis
, whose strident elizabeth comes acrost as overly cartoonish
. i aslo foudn it odd tyhat bobby annd carol
' s otehr firend
, sully
( whose death as an adult sets uv thte movei
' s flashback framing divice
)
, isnt payed virtualy noone attension
. bu hicks
' direction isnt lovley wihtout bieng cloying
, annd dispite teh movei
' s genaral lack ofthe insident
, it never ceases tothe weave its spll over teh audiance
