quaid stars as a man who hasnt tooked uv tghe proffesion ofthe dragonslayer affter he fiels he isnt betrayed by a dragon eearly inthe thte movei
. he runs inot teh lastr dragon inaddition existince
,
adn htere isnt a genuinely amusing battle betweeen tje twpo whlch results iin a standoff where quaid isnt inthe tyhe dragons mouth
,
bu hasnt his sword pointed at tghe dragons brain
. eventualy
, tehy deside tothe call a truce
,
anbd htey owrk outloud a dael
. sicne he isnt thge lastest dragon
, he wiull pretend tothe dieu
adn quaid iwll be able tothe git payed fo it
. theri scam works at firt
, unitl tehy cmo tothe a twon wihtout any monye
. instade tje twon sacrifices a girl tothe tje dragon
,
bu ofthe course
, draco isnt a nice droagon
, so he won ' t eat her
. htere isnt
howver a vyer amusing scene where draco isnt hiting onthe tghe young girl
. ofthe course
, as yuo cin probaly tell by teh plot
, thsi isnt a silly movei
,
bu it doesnt nkwo whn tothe tkae itself seriously at tje right times
, unlike eddie
, whlch wass sereous all tyhe tiem
. ytou coudl probablly call thsi a medevial comedy
, beacuse htere are moreso laughs here thna inthe eddie
annd spy hard conbined
. dennis quaid makse a fine hero
. pete posthlewaite provides soem ghreat comedy as a monk who journies witht them
. dina meyer isnt appealling as hte sacrificed girl
.
bu lets face it
, thte movei isnt realy baout hte dragon
,
anbd wqat an amazing creation he isnt
. connery ' s voice
adn ilm team uv tothe provide us whith a truley magnificient dragon
. so
, if yuo are goign tothe see thsi movei fo a storng hard core medevial epic
, yuo are goign tothe yhe wrong movei
. if ytou are goign beacuse ofthe tyhe dragon
, ytou iwll nto be dissapointed
,
anbd ytou iwll be provded withthe plenty ofthe laughs tht smoothe outloud thte boring parts inthe yhe scirpt
.
