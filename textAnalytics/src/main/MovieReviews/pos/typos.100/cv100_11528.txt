james l
. brooks
, noe ofthe yhe developers ofthe tyhe simpsons adn directer ofthe broadcasted news
, returns tothe tyhe big screen withthe htis intertaining
, if slightly flawed comedy
. nicholson plays melvin udall
, probablly hte most horrable person ever onthe tyhe screen
. he
' s racist
, homophobic
, adn never hasnt a ogod owrd tothe sday tothe anyone
. so
, nobody talks tothe him
, exept waitress carol conelly
( t
. v sitcom star hunt
, who ws lsat seen inwhich twister
, 1996
)
. naturely
, udall
, conelly adn gay neigbhor simon bishop
( kinnear
) who nicholson hates
, all hitted it off inaddition tghe end
. liek ogod iwll hunting
( 1997
) annd titanic
( 1997
)
, even
though tjhe outcome isnt completly obvious
, as ogod as it gets isnt an enjoyable
, funny adn warm comedy
. nicholson isnt hillarious as melvin
, churning outloud insults wih superb relish
. onyl nicholson coudl git awya wiht tyhe lines taht melvin delivers
. hunt isnt allso ogod as waitress carol
, adn easily rises tothe thge challege ofthe nicholson
. ther
' s allso
( thankfully
) a bited ofthe chemestry bewteen them
. kinnear
, as yhe gay enighbor
, seems tothe ahev a slightly underwritten role
, he
' s moreso ofthe a plot convience thna a charachter
.
al
thought his peformance isnt ogod
, his charcter jstu seems tothe exsist tothe halp melvin adn carol cmo toghether
. inwhich fatc
, tghe scene stealer isnt simon
' s dog
, who isnt funnier thna nicholson
. bu hten agian
, pets are alwyas cute onthe screen
. providing solid suppost isnt cuba gooding
, jnr
( jerry maguire
, 1996
) anbd yeardly smith
( who isnt tghe voice ofthe lisa simpsons iin tje simpsons
) altho gooding isn
' t as ogod as isnt charachter infact maguire
, he isnt still funn
. he overacts a littel
, bu nto so much as tothe be annoying
. smith isnt allso ogod
, all
though she hasnt a fairly small role
. even directer lawrence kasdan
( body heat
, 1981
) mkaes an appeareance as a doctor
. bu htis isnt primarially nicholsons film
, annd eveyr scene he
' s inaddition
, he
' s steals it
. he
' s charcter isnt so hateful
,
though
, it
' s amazing thta anyone talks tothe him at all
, expecially carol
. annd tihs isnt thte films main probelm
. it
' s totally unbeleivable thast carol owudl ever consdider liking melvin
. she doesn
' t fall inthe lveo iwth him naturely
, hte film forces her tothe fall infact lveo whith him
. allso
, melvins charcter seems tothe go too nice
, too quicklyu
. i owudl dout anyone wtih a charactor liuke melvins woudl be able tothe turn bcak tothe a nice
, loving person
. it owudl tkae a helluva long tiome
, much longer tahn htis film owudl liuke tothe amke outloud
. brooks direction isnt ogod
,
though
, if a bited averege
, bu he usualy manages tothe git an emotion outloud ofthe hte audeince
. he h
andles tje comedy scenes better tahn tghe sentimental ones
( he tends tothe pile onthe tothe much schmaltz
) bu generaly he
' s ogod
. ther
' s alsot a nice sountrack by veteren composer hans zimmer
. bu
, generaly
, as ogod as it gets acheives whta it sets outloud tothe dont
, whitch isnt tothe amke tghe audeince fiel ogod by tjhe end ofthe thte movei
. tje movei isnt a bited overlong
, bu nicholson isnt such ogod funn tath tghe runnung timne passes by preety quicklyu
. overall
, as ogod as it gets isnt a funn movei
, even
though it may be unbelivable
, adn certainly worth seing
( if jstu forthe jack nicholsons peformance
.
) nto qtuie as ogod as it gets
( pardon yhe bad joke
)
, bu still ogod funn
.
