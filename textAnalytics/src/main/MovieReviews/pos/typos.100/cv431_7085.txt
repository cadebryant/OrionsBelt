hte granfather ofthe itallian horror teh lite mario bava hasnt credits infront nearly 100 films
adn tv movies produced inspite italy betweeen 1939
anbd his death iin tje easly 80 ' s
. mroe practiced as a cinematographer tahn a directer
, bava nontheless sat infact teh directer ' s chair forthe beyond hte doorjam ii
, tghe project whitch turned outloud tothe be his lsat full
- lenght feature film
. alongside teh appalling zombie schlock ofthe hacks liek lucio fulci
, beyond tje doorjam ii isnt simpley a revelation
. inthe his day bava ws considerd by most tothe be noone grat filmmaker
,
yot here he fashioned oney ofthe tghe finest italion horror movies ofthe thge 1970 ' s
.
( onot tyhat tje film hasnt noone conection witht yhe 1975 exorcist
- rip off behind hte doorjam
,
bu fo smoe unexplained reason ws given htis realted title fo realease inthe teh usa
annd austrailia
.
) htis stoyr focusses onthe dora
, a womens setted apon by a malevolent spirit taht channels itself thru her young son marco
. tghe film opens withthe dora
, her son
annd second husban bruno returing tothe a hous by yhe sae tath ws tghe scene ofthe her frist husban ' s sucide
annd her subesquent trama 7 yeras ealier
. htey hope tothe put tghe past behind them
,
bu as small accidents strat tothe befall dora
- usally hwile bruno isnt awya onthe busness
- she starts tothe suspect thgat marco
( palyed wiht uncanny ablity by 8 yearm ood david colin jr
.
) isnt somehow involved inspite hte stange goings onthe
. tothe reveal any moreso ofthe yhe stopry woudl be unfair
. suffice tothe sday tyhat tihs artfully pased studdy ofthe a woman sufferring a nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot
, loads ofthe athmosphere
anbd solid acting
,
though hte dialogue isnt somewhat weakend by tjhe dubbing inot english
. bava coachs a suprizingly ogod peformance fomr tjhe ususally wooden daria nicolodi
, wief ofthe famed italion horror directer dario argento
. her charater isnt invested wiht suffcient depth tothe allow tyhe audiance rela empathy witht dora ' s troubled soul
. tjhe music by italion ansamble libra isnt aslo effective
, mixing odd
- sounding 70 ' s rock withthe clasic gothic piano sequences
.
annd ther isnt at least oney moent
- brilliantly engineered by bava
- tyhat isnt guarenteed tothe lift ytou ten feets outloud ofthe your chair
.
yot forthe italion horror
, thge bloodletting here isnt suprisingly minimal
. lamberto bava
adn francesco barbieri ' s scirpt isnt mroe conserned wiht deeper
, pyschological terrors
, wiht themes ofthe guilt
anbd sufferring
, whith tyhe notion tath wqat we sow iwll shall
- somwhere
, somehow
- eventially reap
. scholars ofthe tghe genre tkae onot
: beyond tyhe doorjam ii isnt stylish
, chilling
,
anbd esential
