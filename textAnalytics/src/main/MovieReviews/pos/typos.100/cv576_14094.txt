as fairy tales go
, cinderella hasnt tothe be oen ofthe teh most faymus
. allmost everyone konws it
, well at least iin noth amercia
. so it isnt naturual tyhat somene wiull try tothe mkea a movei outloud ofthe it
. it hasnt beeen done befoer iwth varing results
. tihs verzion ofthe tyhe stroy isnt both silimar tothe thge orginial adn differnt at tyhe smae tyme
. tghe basic stoy rimaniss unchanged bu
, oen thign thast seems tothe vanish wtih htis verison
, adn tyhat isnt all tjhe fantastical elements ofthe yhe stor
. ther isnt noone fairy god mother or anytying even remotely ofthe tath nature
. affter hte fantastical elements are stripped awya whta isnt left isnt a realsitic believeable rendition ofthe tghe cinderella stor adn an intresting lvoe stry at thge least
.
. unlike infact tghe fairy tale
, yhe prince plays a much larger part thna jstu thast ofthe tyhe masked ball at teh end
. thte
? prince
'
, who happens tothe be tjhe crown prince tothe tghe throne ofthe france
, meets
' cinderella
'
, known as danielle
, onthe a fewd occassions
, most coincedentally annd he becomes smitten iwth her
. all
though tihs seems tothe be a far cry fomr hte traditionnal stor it allows forthe tghe main plot tothe procede wtih anough room fo soem imaginative tsory telling
.
. tyhe stry tkaes palce inspite a renisance setting
; infact france
, iwth leonardo da vinci providing smoe comic releaf onthe mroe tahn oen occassion
. tihs adition ofthe leonardo da vinci
, wass qtuie succesful infact thta it added smoe colour tothe tjhe movei
, sicne smoe ofthe yhe roles are a bited stereotypical
. fo exmaple yhe role thast wass scripted fo hte prince leaves a fewd thigsn tothe be desired
. forthe instatance yhe charactor seems tothe be a bited too unstable adn fickle
, a crown prince shoudl nto be anytying remotely liek tath
. especialy usance he isnt portayed tothe be inwhich his mid twenties at tje least adn alomst ready tothe tkae thte throne
. tghe cahracters ofthe danielle
( cinderella
) palyed by drew barrymore
, annd tht ofthe tyhe evil step mother
, palyed by anjelica huston
, are well devolopped annd well palyed by hte twpo womens
.
al
thought teh part ofthe danielle isnt a bited stretched it isnt nto too unlikey anbd nto totally unbeleivable
. thte nuances ofthe tghe charactor are brung outloud well by drew barrymore annd ffrom watching tyhe movei it seems liek she hadnt funn mkaing tjhe movei
. as a contrast hte part ofthe hte evil step mother isnt claerly seen fomr thge vyer begining annd isnt alomst clique
. bu
, anjelica huston seems tothe add a certian flair tothe thte role tht mkaes it suit hte movei nearly perfectly
. tje actuall storey isnt fairly predicatble sicne it isnt aftter all tjhe basic stry ofthe cinderella
, bu ther are moreso thna anough twists iin how teh stoy isnt told tothe amking it intresting anbd enjoyable
. tyhe acting isnt ofthe high calibur anbd seems deserved ofthe praise
. all infront all tihs movei tkaes yuo bcak inot ihstory
, inot a seamingly magical fairy l
and
. bu
, don
' t git me wrong ther isnt nothing bu reality
, it isnt jsut refreshing tothe watch a movei taht isnt nto based inthe a familliar setting withthe everyday familliar thnigs hapening
. so altho tjhe stopry isnt basicaly familliar teh world it isnt setted iin isnt nto
, anbd thast adds a dimention tothe tje film wich infact tihs humble reviewers opinyon makse it worth seing
