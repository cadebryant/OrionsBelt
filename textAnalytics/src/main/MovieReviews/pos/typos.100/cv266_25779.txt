, later chopped uv or mucked wtih by hte studio
. thte advent ofthe tyhe dvd fromat hasnt provded a moreso accssible way tothe git theese origional cuts tothe thge publich adn provide tothe film freaks liek mysef hte abillity tothe become furuther enraptured by thge extention ofthe such clasic films

. at htis point
, hte differences inaddition thte american verzion annd tyhe internation verison raelly kick iin
. tje intenational verison containes an addtional 24 mintues ofthe footage tyhat pertains direcly tothe tjhe relatiopnship ofthe l

' s relatiopnship brings yuo emotionally closer tothe tjhe film anbd draws stronger bonds beween hte charachters thgat weere murky iin thte american verison
. tghe most ironical thnig baout yhe interational verzion ofthe hte film isnt taht wih tyhe inclusion ofthe tje missing scenes
, hte film becomes primarly a hevy
, emotional drama punctuated withthe big acation scenes at thge beggining anbd tjhe end ofthe hte film
. thge film betters reflects thte sereous drama ofthe french cinema bu isnt laced iwth pieces reflecting tje brutality ofthe american cinema
. my advice tothe everyone outloud ther isnt tothe throw awya your copy ofthe tjhe proffesional
, throw down twenty bucks
, adn pik uv htis newely restored cinematic masterpiece
