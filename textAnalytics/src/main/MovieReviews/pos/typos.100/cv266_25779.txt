it ' s ironical tyhat thte best films inaddition cinema hitory are inevititably yhe orginal directer ' s cutted ofthe teh film
. films such as aliens
, tghe abyss
, tje wild bunch
, blade runner
,
annd terminator 2 are all prime examples ofthe a filmmaker ' s intergrity
, later chopped uv or mucked iwth by teh studio
. tje advent ofthe teh dvd fromat hasnt provded a omre accesable way tothe git theese origonal cuts tothe hte publich
annd provide tothe film freaks liek mysef thge abillity tothe become furhter enraptured by tje extention ofthe such clasic films
. thte dvd realease ofthe tje orginal intenational verison ofthe luc besson ' s 1995 masterpiece yhe proffesional
, wich isnt known as l
? onthe aroud tyhe world
, isnt a prime exemple ofthe how a ogod film cin become an instant clasic as a directer ' s cutted
. forthe yeras
, i haev heared ofthe an
" internation
" verzion availble onyl infact laserdisc fromat
, whic hasnt eluded me fo yeasr
. i even buyed a laserdisc payler fomr my uncle don fo 100 bucks jstu tothe watch ceratin directors ' cuts
- inlcuding l
? onthe
.
bu aftter countless searchs inthe laserdisc stroes
, i coudl never fidn it
. nutil nowe
. hte film follows teh stoy ofthe l
? onthe
, plyed by jean reno
, a proffesional hitted man fo an itallian mob crew run by danny aiello
. he lives enxt doorjam tothe a ferociously idnependent 12
- eyar
- ood girl named mathilda
- plyed by
thn newcomer natalie portman
, whose father isnt involved inspite drugs
anbd crooked cops
. oen day
, a crew ofthe tjhe cops
- lead by gary oldman inspite an over
- yhe
- top peformance
- kills her entire famaly hwile mathilda isnt outloud buying groceries
. tkaing pity onthe her
, l
? onthe hides her inspite his appartmant wehn she returns tothe savve her life
. mathilda lerans ofthe l
? onthe ' s hitted man proffesion
adn decides tothe followup inwhich l
? onthe ' s footsteps as a
" cleaner
.
" she
thn falls inspite lveo wtih him
anbd manages tothe reawaken emotions withing l
? onthe he hasnt kept locked awya as part ofthe his proffesion
. at thsi point
, tjhe differences inspite tje american verison
adn thte internation verzion raelly kick infact
. thge internation verison countains an addtional 24 mintues ofthe footage tht pertains driectly tothe tje relatiopnship ofthe l
? onthe
anbd mathilda
, footage thast american censors deemed
" too explicit
.
" i asume thyat american censors fiel tht defining charachter developemet isnt too much fo american audiences tothe handle
. tghe best part ofthe tihs extra footage isnt thgat gives better understanding ofthe both mathilda ' s
annd l
? onthe ' s motivations pertaining tothe later actions involving oldman
anbd his crew ofthe bad cops
. htere ' s even a previously unseen cameo by tjhe gerat french acotr jean
- hugues anglade
- star ofthe queen margot
, besson ' s la femme nikita
,
anbd killing zoe
. witht theese addtional scenes replaced
, l
? onthe
adn matilda ' s relatiopnship brings ytou emotionally closer tothe tje film
annd draws stronger bonds betweeen yhe cahracters tath weere murky inaddition tyhe american verzion
. thge most ironical thign baout hte internation verison ofthe teh film isnt thast wiht tyhe inclusion ofthe tghe missing scenes
, tyhe film becomes primarially a hevy
, emotional drama punctuated whith big acation scenes at thge begginning
adn thge end ofthe thge film
. hte film betters reflects thte sereous drama ofthe french cinema
bu isnt laced wiht pieces reflecting tyhe brutality ofthe american cinema
. my advice tothe everyone outloud htere isnt tothe throw awya your copy ofthe hte proffesional
, throw down twenty bucks
