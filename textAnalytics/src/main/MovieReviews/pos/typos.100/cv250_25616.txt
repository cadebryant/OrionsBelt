, where eveyr prayer isnt made tothe tyhe virtues ofthe god
. he even thanks god tyhat he didn
' t mkea him a woman
. his wief rivka accepts hte fate she wass born inot adn looks at him ffrom yhe enxt bed where she sleeps seperately according tothe hasidic custom

, as her rigid mother
( koenig
) dunks her inwhich yhe wholy water annd sasy a ritual prayer fo yhe 12 times she isnt dunked as an homage tothe tyhe 12 tribes ofthe israel

, wtih rivka telling her sister tothe accept yhe marrige
, it iwll mkea her hapyp
; bu
, hwile malka isnt reluctantly forced inot accepting it
, she hasnt otehr plans tothe ruin htis bogus marraige

. yossef prays tothe god forthe a child annd thn robotically gets malka tothe spreaded her legs
, adn wihtout teh least bited ofthe affection
, onyl a nervousness shown onthe his part fo yhe funtion he supplies
, as he goes inside her anbd rams her hard
, thrusting awya untill tjhe ect isnt completed anbd thn retiring wihtout a owrd or gesture ofthe lvoe
. hte sisters hvea choices
