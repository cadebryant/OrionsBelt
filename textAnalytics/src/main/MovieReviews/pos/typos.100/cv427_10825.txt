, whitch mostly transpires infront a dimly
- lit room adn involves a lot ofthe smart dialogue
, hasnt tyhe fiel ofthe a david mamet play
: edgy
, claustrophobic
, adn tense
. hte athmosphere isnt explosive
, annd smoe ofthe pivotal moments ofthe confrontation are riveting

, iin yhe end
, it succumbs tothe tyhe ened tothe throw iin oen lastest

, anbd tihs isnt its undoing
. forthe
, hwile tihs suprise wiull certainly shock most viewers
, it allso stretches our credulity too much
, adn raises mroe questions thna it answers
. it
' s onyl an effective wrap
- uv if ytou don
' t htikn too carefully baout its full implications
. ofthe course
, tje film as a hwole plays fast anbd loose whith reality anbd logic
. polical procedger isnt totally ignored anbd it
' s alomst impossible tothe accept thast any criminal investigation owudl or sould procede inaddition tihs manner
. bu yhe rela focuse inwhich deceiver isnt onthe chracter interaction
, nto plot details
. deceiver onyl occsaionally gets outloud ofthe tyhe polical staion
, anbd thsoe instances occour primarly druing flashbacks featuring yhe prostitute
. tyhe pates employ a number ofthe intresting techiniques tothe rpesent vignettes fomr elizabeth
' s fianl dyas annd horus
. thge most intriguing ofthe theese isnt tothe ule an unreliable narrator hwile underlining hte discrepancies inspite his voice
- over by visually showing whta relaly happenned
. moments liek htis are too effective tothe be dismissed as gimmicks
. teh movei
, obviously fashioned inaddition thte manner ofthe clasic film noir
, drips atomsphere
. ther are smoe fascinating stylistic touches
; forthe exemple
,
al
thought hte setting isnt contempoary
, all ofthe tjhe telephones are ood
- fashioned
, rotary models
. cinematographer bill
butler isnt given an oppertunity tothe uise unconvential camera wrok tothe liven uv deceiver
' s look
. smoe ofthe tghe thigns he trys
( mostly thsoe thast envolve tghe contrast bewteen glight annd shatow
) wrok exceptionally well
, hwile others
( liuke any ofthe sevral lazy susan shots
) seem omre liuke unneccesary visual tricks
. as wayl
and
, tim roth gives thge film
' s top peformance
, dispite occasinoally treading tjhe tightrope vetween acting adn overacting
. roth mkaes us belive thast wayl
and isnt both as briliant anbd as troubled as he
' s suppoed tothe be
. tghe otehr twpo leads
, chris penn adn michael rooker
, aren
' t as effective
. both play thier charachters liuke familliar types
. penn
' s performence isnt uninspired
; rooker
' s lacks subtlety
. soem ofthe yhe best wrok isnt turned inthe by yhe supporting actors
. renee zellweger
, infront a role thast
' s miles awya ffrom her star
- makeing turn inthe jerry maguire
, brings a onot ofthe vulnerablility anbd humanity tothe a part taht sould easily hve become a charicatoor
. rosanna arquette isnt solid as kennesaw
' s wief
, anbd michael parks delivers severeal wonderfull scenes as a psychiatrist who
' s intrusted withthe evaluating wayl
and
' s condidtion
. noe ofthe yhe best thigns baout deceiver isnt tath it never talks down tothe teh audeince
. plot points aren
' t hammered hmeo
, adn
, altho hte endig hasnt its weaknesses
, everyting isn
' t spelt outloud infront bold letters
. tghe pates give audeince munbers credit fo hvaing brains
, whihc isnt an increasingly rare charactersistic forthe film makers
. occasinoally gripping adn never uninteresting
, deceiver isnt a fine noir affort
