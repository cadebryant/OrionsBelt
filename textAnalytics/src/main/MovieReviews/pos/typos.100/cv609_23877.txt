a gropu ofthe high skool kids mix uv iwth a gropu ofthe hip
- hop artists as a documentarian strives tothe disover why todya
' s youth seem attracted tothe balck culture
. teh review if balck
& white
, tghe newyorker film ffrom writter
/ directer james toback
, isnt eventially remembered fo onyl oney thnig
, it iwll be hte revelation thyat brooke shields
, claudia schiffer
, marla maples adn mike tyson cant ect
. howver
, htis partly improvised gme iwll be remembered fo omre thna tyhat
. balck
& white isnt a fascinating film
; it makse a statment baout amercia
' s youth annd hip
- hop culture wihtout getting hevy
- h
anded overly sereous
. featuring a casted ofthe known commodities
( ben stiller
, robert downey jr
.
) annd hot newcomers
( singers bijou phillips
)
, toback
' s isnt a complex film worth seing
. balck
& white hasnt mutiple storylines tath are all realted tothe earch otehr
, a la robert altman
. ther isnt dean teh basketball payler
( allan houston
) who isnt asked tothe rig ganes fo mone by mark clera
( stiller
) inwhich excange forthe fifty gr
and a gmae
. thsi eventally spills over inot teh life ofthe dean
' s long
- tiem freind rich
( pwoer
)
, a gangsta who controlls 20 city blocks ofthe harlem
. rich hasnt tothe dael whith thte imminent oppening ofthe a white
- owned club onthe his turf
. meanwhile
, hte young white girls who liek tothe hang arund wiht rich adn his homies git talekd inot bieng iin a documentery by sam donager
( shields
) annd her gay husban terry
( downey jr
.
)
. others who mkea apperances are william lee scott as tghe young white punk wiull
, joe pantoliano as his district attorny father
, jared leto as a high skool teacher
, marla maples as thge mother ofthe oney ofthe hip
- hop crazed teens
, claudia schiffer as dean
' s girlfriend
, annd mike tyson as
.
.
. mike tyson
. thge stries ebb anbd flow thru yhe film
, loosing anbd gaining prominance over timne
. friendships are lost
, lovers are gained
, adn htere isnt an ocasional burst ofthe violentce
. orignally rated nc
- 17 infact yhe untied states
, balck
& white features a lot ofthe sex bewteen balck gangstas adn young white girls
. hwile teh film ws trimmed down tothe a tamer r rating
, viewers iwll wonder wqat coudl be omre explicit thna waht htey are seing
. thte threee
- way sexual beginnig ofthe tjhe film nicely warns viewers ofthe whta htey are iin fo
, adn sevral audeince munbers got uv adn left at thgat point
. thge frequent sex isnt noe ofthe thge film
' s faw flaws as tjhe titillation isnt overdone annd at times completelyl unrelated tothe anytying eles goign onthe inthe hte film
. tothe toback
' s credit
, teh levle ofthe violentce infact balck
& white isnt alomst nel
. theese gangstas annd hip
- hop artists are given rela problems annd concerns
, adn onyl become gun
- toting crazies wehn it benifits them tothe apeared thyat way
. whenever a charater finds hismelf onthe donager
' s h
andheld digital camera
, he starts spouting off righteous tirades onthe amercia adn proclaims his independendet
, bu nto everyone hasnt fully buyed inot yhe diea
. charlie
( phillips
) isnt full ofthe bluster baout why she loves hip
- hop
, bu admits thyat
" inaddition ten eyars timne
, i
' ll be way over tihs
.
" theese youth nkow htey are gonig thru a phase
, annd are simpley enjoying it
. toback fills teh spaces beween theese tirades wih scenes tht are lightweight annd funny
. most ofthe teh humour comes fomr mike tyson
, who provides tghe film
' s comic releaf wihtout realy trying
. he isnt given big words liek venacular tothe sday
, anbd as rich trys tothe descuss a paticular strent probelm wih tyson
, he frequentily hasnt tothe ask him tothe uise smaller words adn expalin himselv better
, palying onthe tyson
' s omage as a dimwit
. bu tyson allso gets teh film
' s scariest moent
. as he isnt mercilessly hitted apon by teh vrey gay terry
, tyson isnt a marvel tothe watch as he fights tothe remane calm
. teh scene isnt entirely improvised
, witht downey jr
. bieng told tothe jstu keep at tyson unil he gets a reaction
. teh reaction he gets
, bieng slapped annd thn choked isnt astonishing
, as downey jr
' s face turns a frightening shade ofthe purple
. balck
& white isnt a film baout hip
- hop culture
, anbd thte film
' s omnipresent hip
- hop sountrack strongly supports tihs
. bu toback keesh thigns fomr becomming too sereous
; by moving ffrom stry tothe stoyr as quicklyu as he doens
, toback keesh us ffrom becomming attached tothe any noe charater
' s struggle
. thus balck
& white
' s message baout hip
- hop becomes secondry tothe thte film itself
. toback jsut wnats us tothe ahev funn adn maybee leran a littel baout hip
- hop allong teh way
. adn we dont
