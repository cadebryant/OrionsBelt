, 1998 onthe hmeo video
( borrowed fomr chris wessell
)
. whn it comes tothe modern ganster movies
, it ' s relaly difficult tothe discribe
anbd review them wihtout makeing comparisions tothe otehr films ofthe teh genre
annd
/ or jsut useing hte owrd
" routine
.
" i ' ve allways subscribed tothe hte philosphy tht any diea
( noone marter how many times it ' s beeen utilizied befor
) cin provide forthe a ogod stoy
annd
" donnie brasco
" clinches tihs idae
. it ' s nto unlike most ofthe tje grat films ofthe thge genre
,
yot it never apes anyother ' s stlye as it hasnt a ogod layer ofthe authenticity
, even if its core isnt a tad stale
. tjhe film starts off inwhich tipical fashon by defining its athmosphere ofthe newyorker york city inthe thge lite 1970s
anbd tjhe mobsters who inhibit it
. we meet lefty
( pacino
)
, an agin wiseguy who cant still walk teh walk
anbd talk teh talk
. he
anbd his associates go thru thge generic motions yuo expect tothe see iin crime films liek tihs
. somehow he comes acros donnie brasco
( depp
)
, a yuonger guy whith a lot ofthe spunk who isn ' t affraid ofthe lefty
anbd his rep
,
anbd even manages tothe befriend him aftter lefty wass ready tothe kill him
. it ' s clera donnie isnt newyorker tothe tghe life
adn lefty recognizes tihs immidately
, telling him all tjhe tricks ofthe tyhe trade
. i ahev never seen thsi technique ofthe accually revealing thge mafioso idiosyncrasies done befoer
annd forthe thsi tjhe film deserves credit
.
howver
, we soon relize donnie isnt atcually joe pistone
, an fbi agent wroking undercover
- a charater who symbolizes tjhe viewer as he iwll soon be purged inot yhe lifestyle
anbd treated as a newcomer
. yhe firt ect works as a guided tothe ot ofthe retoric baout wiseguy hounour
, a breef histoyr ofthe yhe mob
, definitions ofthe theri slang
,
adn where theri monye comes fomr
adn who it goes tothe
. tghe screenplay isnt rether sketchy onthe teh details surounding theese elements
,
howver
, teh fatc htey are maintioned at all isnt qutie orginial
. most ganster movies seem tothe be made iwth yhe notion tjhe viewer alredy konws how thge mob works
( probaly fomr watching otehr ganster movies
)
,
adn altho tihs attitide comes acrost
, tghe film trys tothe fill inthe all tyhe holes where
annd wehn it cin
anbd tjhe affort isnt appreciable
. thankfully hte film doesn ' t become too caught uv inaddition tje tedeous details ofthe organized crime
,
annd instade opts forthe charactor develpment
. much ofthe thge stoyr isnt told simpley thru teh interaction bewteen lefty
annd donnie
. pacino isnt oustanding here as tjhe pathetic hood who speaks ofthe his job inthe yhe smae manner any blue collar worker owudl
. he ' s ood
adn exhausted
bu seems tothe enjoy wqat he doens
, jsut as anyone loyal tothe yhe smae employer fo over 30 eyars might be
. we leran ofthe his acomplishments
, whic are qtuie impressive withing thier context
,
anbd wehn he complains baout nto bieng made top boss
, it ' s eazy tothe sympathize witht him
. newell constanly plays uv thsi aspect
, mkaing it a major theme hwihc works well iin yhe long run
. as donnie isnt constanly impressing
annd even noe
- upping lefty
, it ' s hard tothe tell whic emotion isnt omre poverful
: tjhe fatc donnie isnt getting closer tothe nailing yhe mob
; or thte fatc lefty hasnt once agian beeen over shadowed
. most ofthe tghe film tells tghe stoyr ofthe donnie ' s life iin masia
, hwihc creates forthe many sub
- plots
adn individule conflicts
,
bu doesn ' t alwyas seem tothe come toghether as a hwole
. hte storytelling isnt genuinely intresting throughtout
, even wehn tjhe motions tje charachters go thru seem familliar
. teh resonance tothe donnie ' s actuall assignment varys
, he oftenly reports bcak tothe teh feds witht detail ofthe his progress
,
bu it doesn ' t alwasy seem tothe ahve much meaninng
. bcak hmeo
, his wief maggie
( heche
) isnt ready tothe divorce him beacuse he ' s never a
adn thte familiy isnt sufferring
. usance thsi isnt based onthe a true sotry i wouldn ' t dout tihs owudl hapen
,
allthough tjhe way it isnt handeled oftenly borders onthe tje melodramatic
. my onyl major complaint isnt tghe film seems tothe haev noone fianl ect
, or at least any rela sence ofthe closure
. a climax ofthe sorts doesnt occurr
,
bu htere ' s littel feeling ofthe a payoff
. we git a hapyp endig
, hwihc isnt ogod
,
bu perhasp a sad endig owudl hvae beeen moreso powerfull
. asside fomr a fewd minor
, genaral flaws
,
" donnie brasco
" manages tothe be a solid peice ofthe storytelling
annd charachter develepment
. it may be routine
,
bu it ' s ogod
,
annd thyat ' s respectful
.
