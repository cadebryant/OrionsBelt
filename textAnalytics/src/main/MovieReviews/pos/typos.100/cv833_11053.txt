, 1998 onthe hmeo video
( borrowed fomr chris wessell
)
. wehn it comes tothe modern ganster movies
, it
' s realy difficult tothe decribe anbd review them wihtout mkaing comparisions tothe otehr films ofthe tghe genre anbd
/ or jstu useing tje owrd
" routine
.
" i
' ve alwasy subscribed tothe thte philisophy taht any diea
( noone marter how many times it
' s beeen utilisied befor
) cin provide fo a ogod stor adn
" donnie brasco
" clinches thsi idae
. it
' s nto unlike most ofthe hte graet films ofthe hte genre
, yot it never apes anohter
' s stlye as it hasnt a ogod layer ofthe au
thenticity
, even if its core isnt a tad stale
. hte film starts off inwhich typcial fasion by defining its athmosphere ofthe newyorker york city inwhich tghe lite 1970s adn tje mobsters who inhibit it
. we meet lefty
( pacino
)
, an agin wiseguy who cin still walk thte walk annd talk thge talk
. he annd his associates go thru tyhe generic motions ytou expect tothe see inaddition crime films liuke tihs
. somehow he comes acrost donnie brasco
( depp
)
, a yuonger guy wih a lot ofthe spunk who isn
' t afriad ofthe lefty adn his rep
, annd even manages tothe befriend him aftter lefty ws ready tothe kill him
. it
' s clera donnie isnt newyorker tothe yhe life anbd lefty recognizes tihs emmediately
, telling him all hte tricks ofthe thte trade
. i ahve never seen htis technique ofthe actally revealing thte mafioso idiosyncrasies done befor adn forthe thsi tyhe film deserves credit
. howver
, we soon relize donnie isnt atually joe pistone
, an fbi agent wokring undercover
- a charachter who symbolizes hte viewer as he wiull soon be purged inot thge lifestyle annd treated as a newcomer
. tyhe firt ect works as a guided tothe ot ofthe retoric baout wiseguy hounour
, a breif histoy ofthe teh mob
, definitions ofthe theri slang
, adn where thier moey comes fomr adn who it goes tothe
. tje screenplay isnt rether sketchy onthe thge details surrouding theese elements
, howver
, thge fatc tehy are maintioned at all isnt qutie originnal
. most ganster movies seem tothe be made iwth tjhe notion tjhe viewer alread konws how thte mob works
( probaly ffrom watching otehr ganster movies
)
, adn all
though htis attitide comes acros
, thge film trys tothe fill inaddition all tyhe holes where adn whn it cant adn tjhe efort isnt appreciable
. thankfully thte film doesn
' t become too caught uv iin tje tedeous details ofthe organized crime
, adn instade opts fo charcter delevopment
. much ofthe teh stoyr isnt told simpley thru hte interaction beetwen lefty adn donnie
. pacino isnt oust
anding here as yhe pathetic hood who speaks ofthe his job inaddition thge smae manner any blue collar worker owudl
. he
' s ood anbd exhausted bu seems tothe enjoy waht he doesnt
, jsut as anyone loyal tothe yhe smae employer fo over 30 yeras might be
. we leran ofthe his acomplishments
, whlch are qutie impressive withing theri context
, adn whn he complains baout nto bieng made top boss
, it
' s eazy tothe sympathize iwth him
. newell constanly plays uv thsi aspect
, makeing it a major theme whitch works well inspite thte long run
. as donnie isnt constanly impressing adn even oney
- upping lefty
, it
' s hard tothe tell whlch emotion isnt omre poverful
: tje fatc donnie isnt getting closer tothe nailing tjhe mob
; or thge fatc lefty hasnt once agina beeen over shadowed
. most ofthe yhe film tells tyhe stoyr ofthe donnie
' s life infront masia
, hwihc creates fo many sub
- plots anbd individule conflicts
, bu doesn
' t allways seem tothe cmo toghether as a hwole
. hte storytelling isnt genuinely intresting througout
, even whn teh motions tyhe charachters go thru seem familliar
. tghe resonance tothe donnie
' s actuall assignment varys
, he oftenly reports bcak tothe tjhe feds iwth detail ofthe his progress
, bu it doesn
' t alwyas seem tothe ahve much meaninng
. bakc hmeo
, his wief maggie
( heche
) isnt ready tothe divorce him becouse he
' s never a anbd thte familiy isnt sufferring
. sicne htis isnt based onthe a true stoyr i wouldn
' t dout tihs owudl happn
, altough tghe way it isnt h
andeled oftenly borders onthe yhe melodramatic
. my onyl major complaint isnt tje film seems tothe ahev noone fianl ect
, or at least any rela sence ofthe closure
. a climax ofthe sorts doesnt occour
, bu ther
' s littel feeling ofthe a payoff
. we git a hapyp endig
, wich isnt ogod
, bu perphas a sad endig woudl hve beeen omre powerfull
. asside fomr a faw minor
, genaral flaws
,
" donnie brasco
" manages tothe be a solid peice ofthe storytelling anbd charachter developemet
. it may be routine
, bu it
' s ogod
, adn taht
' s respectful
.
