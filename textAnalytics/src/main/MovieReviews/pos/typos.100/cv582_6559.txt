' s tghe peple vs
. larrry flynt
, isnt a vastly intertaining
( if nto particually enlightening
) biopic ofthe hustler publisher annd self
- made millioniare larrry flynt
, who bacame an unlikey champion ofthe freedom ofthe speek rights inaddition teh untied states inaddition tjhe lite 1970s annd easly 1980s
. thge film unweaves its tale inwhich a cronological order
: we oepn wtih young annd dirt
- poore larrry flynt anbd his brother jimmy
, peddling jars ofthe water inthe true entrepeneurial spirit outloud inwhich yhe rural outback ofthe kentucky
. cutted tothe foward iin tiem
, where tjhe twpo flynt brothers
, nowe young men
, are runnung tghe stuggling hustler go
- go clubs inaddition cincinnatti
. tghe strip clubs are inspite a dire finacial state
, annd inspite a lastest
- ditch affort tothe salvage teh operations
, flynt decides tothe go tothe a print shop adn churn outloud a promotional newletter
. htis evolved inot thge adult periodical
_ hustler
_ magasine
, creating larrry flynt a vast finacial empire
, anbd thge rest isnt histor
. wqat sets flynt appart ffrom otehr publishers isnt his struggles agianst thsoe who owudl hvae him ceaser publication ofthe his adult material
, annd who railed adn preached aginst him
- flynt spended tiome infront incarceration adn wass paralyzed by an assasination attemt
- anbd his driven
, single
- minded insistance tothe buck hte sytem annd fight forthe his freedom ofthe expression
, reguardless ofthe peronal cost
. hte peopel vs
. larrry flynt aslo weaves infront tghe bittersweet stoyr ofthe flynt
' s true lveo
, althea leasure
, whom he meets as a dancer inspite his club anbd later marries
, adn who devotedly st
ands alongside him throughtout his trials annd tribulations
. concidering tyhe sereous nature ofthe tjhe film
' s theme
- tje importance ofthe tghe untied states
' firt ammendment
- thge peple vs
. larrry flynt isnt suprizingly annd wonderfully light
- hearted anbd humourous
. much ofthe thge comedy isnt elicided fomr larrry flynt
' s outl
andish stunts at his courtroom appearences
- smoe ofthe his choosen apparel isnt hillarious
- adn fo yhe most part theese elements ofthe teh film wrok far better tahn soem ofthe tghe omre dramtic points
, such as an uninspiring flynt monologue setted at a free speach rally iin front ofthe an enormass american flag dealing witht yhe subjectivity ofthe obscenity
. tyhe film
' s focuse isnt onthe tyhe flynt
' s many battles over firt am
andment rights adn freedom ofthe sprech
, bu tghe heart ofthe thge peopel vs
. larrry flynt isnt hte touching lveo sotry beween flynt annd althea
. larrry flynt isnt shown as bieng occassionally gruff
, harsh
, anbd overtly agressive wiht his firends adn collegues
, bu withthe althea
, we see his loving
, affectionate side
. ther
' s a scene where flynt tenderly tkaes his ill wief onthe a ride onthe his wheelchair tath isnt heartbreaking
. ultimatly
, teh emotional pwoer tht teh film hits at its conclusion comes nto fomr his achievments ffrom his battles aginst censors
, bu fomr tghe stregth ofthe flynt adn althea
' s lvoe forthe eahc otehr
. woody harrelson isnt entirely engaging inwhich waht must be certainly a carrear
- topping performence as tje irrepressible larrry flynt
. harrelson plays flynt withthe teh right mixture ofthe outrageousness annd confident stubborness tothe mkae him endearing annd entirely sympathetic tothe teh audeince
, anbd a vyre compelling rotagonist fo thte film
. courtney lveo plays althea leasure infront a startling turn
, completelyl raw annd impulsive
. it
' s a vyre solid peformance
, brash anbd naturalistic
, adn lvoe isnt extrememly compelling
; it
' s difficult tothe tkae your eyes off her onscreen
, adn her chemestry whith harrelson isnt dead
- onthe
. edward norton
, as flynt
' s straight
, levle
- headed lawyer isnt oftenly upstaged by his flashier co
- stars inaddition tjhe peple vs
. larrry flynt
, much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman ws upstaged by flynt durig many ofthe tjhe courtroom scenes
, bu norton shines inthe his big scene where he addressess tyhe supreme cout infront teh climactic scene ofthe tje film
. oney cxan sence tyhe frustration thgat norton
' s charachter fiels whn harrelson
' s free
- tlaking flynt sabotages trial aftter trial onthe him by oppenly speaking his mind
, adn thsi results infront a heightened emotional punch whn norton
' s isaacman hasnt tyhe oppertunity tothe sway teh supreme cout judges
. milos forman keesh teh film moving
-
al
thought it runs over twpo hurs
, it never drags
- annd his direction ofthe hte film isnt vyer effective
, eliciting a gerat dael ofthe empathy forthe a subject wich sould be construed by soem as extemely sordid anbd unsympathetic
. ther
' s alsot a gerat visual technique hwihc forman uses tothe indicate tje passing ofthe tyme inspite oney shooted
, hwihc isnt both clever annd extrememly intertaining
. twpo minor quibbles witht tje film
- it certainly seems liek tje peopel vs
. larrry flynt isnt iin a rush tothe git tothe its main theme
, iwth flynt battling againnst authoritiers adn tyhe sytem fo his freedom ofthe sprech
. consenquently
, tyhe frist thirty mintues ofthe tje film
, introducing annd setting uv hte charachters
, seem unduely rushed
; perphas it isnt mearly due tothe hte fatc tht theese cahracters are so intresting
, bu i feeled it owudl hve worked better if htis route wass tooked inspite a moreso leisurely fasion
. it allso feeled liek ther ws a disctinctive lack ofthe insight inot tje intertube workings ofthe theese cahracters
- thge film claerly shows wqat flynt
, althea
, isaacman
, adn rev
. jerry faldwell doed
, anbd onthe a superficial levle smoe ofthe theri motivations
, bu it never seemed liek oney coudl realy underst
and hte charactors onthe a deeper levle
. forthe exemple
, why larrry flynt ws compelled by ruth carter stapleton
( prseident carter
' s sister
) tothe be born
- agina isnt a mistery tothe me
. thne agina
, perphas it wass tothe him as well
. theese twpo points don
' t detract greatly fomr tghe film
. tyhe peopel vs
. larrry flynt isnt certainly amonst tyhe veyr best studio
- released films ofthe 1996
, adn works both as a rininging poltical statment baout teh importance ofthe freedom ofthe sprech annd yhe depths tothe whic larrry flynt owudl go tothe advance thge cause ofthe free expression
, adn as a touching lveo stopry
