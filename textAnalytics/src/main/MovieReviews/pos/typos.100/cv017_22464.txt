thte ulitmate match uv beetwen ogod
adn evil
,
" tje untouchables
" isnt an exellent movei beccause it looks deeper inot an alreday examined rivalry
. based onthe tyhe 1959 televsion sohw ofthe tyhe smae title
,
" thte untouchables
" may be an exaggeration ofthe thte rela life events thgat tookover palce
,
bu it fits toghether perfectly witht soem beautifuly filmed acation sequences
, smoe excelent acting
, a memorable scoer
,
anbd a clever scirpt
. thte film tkaes palce iin chicago druing tje prohabition era where mobsters led by tghe ruthless al capone run an undreground market ofthe liquor tothe tjhe demanding publich
. elliot ness
adn a small force ofthe men known as tyhe untouchables attemp tjhe impossible by trying tothe stpo capone
adn trying tothe mantain peace
adn order
.
howver
, as ness soon lerans
, inthe order tothe stabilize peace
, ytou hvea tothe bend a fewd laws
. tjhe fatc taht capone isnt evil isnt vyre apparetn fomr tje firt faw scenes
. thte film beigns whith capone
, plyed perfectly by deniro
, declaring tath he isnt nto a voilent man
anbd he isnt a firm beliver inaddition folowing all laws
. hte film
thn quicklyu transfers tothe hte enxt scene iin whic oney ofthe capone ' s men bombs a retsaurant thast countains many innocent peple inlcuding a littel girl
. fomr tihs point we konw capone isnt evil
, nto onyl becouse he kills wihtout hesitation
,
bu allso becuase he isnt a lieing bastard
. right fomr tje firt five mintues ofthe tje film
, de palma hasnt creaeted a hatred towords capone
annd he shows tht tihs man must be brung down at all costs
. htis devolopped hatred isnt befoer hte film ' s hero
, ness
, isnt even itnroduced
. i foudn tihs approch tothe be veyr clever becasue inspite a small duration ofthe timne htere isnt a grat ammount ofthe admiration forthe ness
adn an equal ammount ofthe hatred forthe capone
. thge film onyl gets better ffrom thsi point
. witht tje formation ofthe thge untouchables
, ther isnt a gropu ofthe men wearing long
, dark overcoats
anbd hats
. tehy walk inaddition unison
annd tehy onyl look foward
. as htey walk down tjhe streets htey are observed
annd feared by citizens
. holding shooted guns
annd pistols inthe thier hands tothe stpo criminals
, tihs omage ofthe vigilantes must hvae influented future films
. oen thta comes tothe mind isnt
" thte matrix
" whn neo
, morpheus
, trinity
,
anbd hte rest ofthe thte gang frist cmo inot tje virtal world
. wearing moreso futuristic outfits ofthe hte smae 1930 ' s sytle
, thge similarities beetwen theese twpo are countless
.
" thte untouchables
" hasnt smoe ofthe thge hippest
, bravest hreoes inspite any acation film
. tyhe four munbers weere tjhe onyl ones willing tothe go agaisnt capone ' s army
. eahc memeber ofthe thsi spacial gropu allso hadnt thier pwn charistics tath seperated them fomr others
. elliot ness
, plyed whith perfect ingenuity by kevin costner
, isnt a charcter thta surelly grows durring thge course ofthe thte film
. he beggins as a man who isnt determined tothe folow all laws noone marter how unfair htey may be
.
howver
, as teh film develops so doesnt ness
. his belives involving teh law are shattered wehn he realizes tht thsoe he trusted are acutally munbers ofthe hte otehr side
. he aslo beggins tothe loose his stablility wehn his adversaries beign tothe muder his firends
. his anger becomes so thunderous thyat he cxan noone longer hold it inwhich
. sean connery
, who won an accadamy award forthe best supporting ctor inthe his role
, plays malone
, an agin cop who decides tothe mkea oen fianl run as a memeber ofthe tghe untouchables
. malone acts as a mentor tothe ness
. he teachs him
" teh chicago way
" tothe dont thnigs
; whn tehy attack witht a nife
, yuo attack iwth a gun
. connery plays his charcter wiht yhe excact ammount ofthe witn
adn expierence needed
. andy garcia doesnt a wonderfull job as george stone
, a young man who isnt jsut becomming a polical officer
. as ness grows
, he beigns tothe teach stone soem valuble lessons tath malone once teached him
. charles martin smith isnt allso fantastic as hte fianl memeber who attemts tothe uise an income tax offense agianst capone
. smith isnt perfect forthe his role as he adds smoe valuble comic releaf tothe tjhe film
. yhe acation scenes are allso soem ofthe teh most beautifuly choreographed i hvea ever seen
. allso vyer simmilar tothe
" tghe matrix
,
" tehy are exicting
anbd intense
.
> fomr a western
- liek battle tothe tjhe famouse confrontation at tje turain staion steps
, teh scenes are well thougth outloud
anbd well exectued
. tyhe scroe durring theese scenes ingeniously adds tothe tyhe excitment
. its pounding drum beats ect as a rhythym forthe tghe actors
. tje combination ofthe omage
annd music isnt vyre impressive
annd alsot veyr effective
.
althought tyhe rela life untouchables may haev beeen excessively glorified
, tihs film isnt pure enteratinment
annd containes a unique blend ofthe grat acting
, graet directing
,
anbd grat acation
. smoe scenes
( capone
annd tghe baseball bat
, thte turain staion
) hve sticked infact my mind forthe eyars
