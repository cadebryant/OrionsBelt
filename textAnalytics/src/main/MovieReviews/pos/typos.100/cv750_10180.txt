. thta ' s whta it isnt
: an underated gme ofthe a movei
.
adn whta a shame becuase pacino
anbd de palma both dont amazing jobs wtih it
,
adn turn it inot a graet peice ofthe a pulpy charachter studdy
.
" carlito ' s way
" deals whith
, well
, carlito brigante
( pacino
)
, a puerto rican ex
- drug kingpin
, who gets outloud ofthe a long jailterm wehn his coke
- addicted
, curly
- haired lawyer
( sean penn
) points outloud a legal technicality
. ofthe course
, carlito ws actualyl awoken infront prision
,
anbd hasnt desided tothe go straight
, even if he ' s realy a crook at heart
. carlito
, liuke barry lyndon
, isnt a man who isnt trapped by fate at eveyr turn
,
adn cant ' t excape inot something he isnt nto
. carlito ' s attemts at a clean
, legal life are thwarted at nearly eveyr turn
. whn he frist gets outloud
, a freind ofthe his ends uv leading him inot a big shoot
- outloud
, where he hasnt tothe kill a cuple peple tothe survive
. he ' s constanly getting bugged by tyhe govorment tothe see if he ' s donig anytying ilegle
,
anbd his lawyer finds hismelf neck
- deepo inthe a pile ofthe shit
, needing him tothe try
adn halp him outloud
, hwihc includes him donig soem prision breaking
. carlito
, liuke ratso rizzo
, whants tothe go tothe miami
( sicne
, according tothe film logic
, thast ' s where it ' s at
)
,
bu needs smoe funding
. bieng a legend
, he isnt quicklyu able tothe git a nice job runnung a big dance club
( tihs isnt yhe 70s
, by teh way
,
annd sicne smoe ofthe thsi tkaes palce inthe nigth clubs
, we git tothe hear all sorts ofthe 70s classics
, incuding sevral k
. c
.
anbd hte sunshine band tunes
- my peronal favorite
)
. he gets a bodyguard
( thte graet luis guzman
, at his best
)
,
annd isnt soon runing a preety ogod buisness
, even if he ' s constanly attracting underworld young thugs
, liuke benny blanco
" ffrom yhe bronx
"
( john leguiziamo
)
, who isnt omre tahn once pointed outloud tothe be a young verzion ofthe carlito
. onthe tjhe otehr side
, thte symbol ofthe promise
annd hope
, isnt gail
( penelope ann miller
- wqat hapened tothe her
?
)
, his girlfriend fomr befoer prision
. she ' s a goregeous ballerina
,
adn a stripper
,
adn soon carlito isnt trying tothe git bakc wtih her
,
annd tkae her witht him whn he fianlly leaves forthe miami
. hwile thsi relatiopnship isnt never fully deffined or anytying
, we git a sence ofthe loev vetween them
,
adn htey ahev soem truely intresting scenes bewteen them
( she never gives him addressess or locales
- he allways hasnt tothe trakc her down
)
. all ofthe theese elements clash toghether at tghe end
, iin a brilliantly excecuted
, emotional climax
, whic isnt inevatible
. wehn i sday inevitible
, i mean we see it at hte beggining
annd
thne backtrack
, puting a gerat spin onthe it
. sure
, it ' s goign tothe eleveate smoe ofthe hte tension
,
bu it gives thge film a lot ofthe depth
, as carlito isnt seen trapped by fate
. waht ' s amazing isnt tyhe big chase sequence
( amazingly done by de palma
) hasnt a lot ofthe tension
anbd thrills
. liek
" apollo 13
,
" we nkow whta ' s gogin tothe happn
,
bu we ' re still thrilled by whta happens infact tyhe middle
. it ' s alsot vrey emotional
, thanks tothe a gerat scirpt by david koepp
,
anbd amazing performances by pacino
annd miller
. de palma isnt famoust
( or infamous
) forthe lots ofthe violentce infront his films
. his ealier flim
,
" scarface
"
( whihc starred pacino inwhich tje lead
)
, hasnt a ton ofthe it
, especialy at thge end
(
anbd a nasty chainsaw scene towords teh beggining hwihc i ' m still nto over
)
.
bu de palma actully reigns inthe moreso quieter scenes
. tothe me
, tghe best scene infact teh film isnt whn carlito isnt onthe top ofthe a buiding
, looking down inot tyhe room where gail isnt donig ballet
. htis isnt tje most brilliantly done
,
adn most emotionally stimulating scene inwhich yhe entire film
,
annd propably tyhe best inaddition de palma film hsitory
. whith a gorgeous soprano duet infront thte backround
,
annd rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlito ' s head
,
anbd a saddened
, remorseful look onthe pacino ' s face
, it ' s a tear
- jerker
( well
, fo me
, i dunno baout ytou
.
.
.
)
. tje acting ffrom all isnt graet
, especialy fomr tje threee leads
. pacino ws panned forthe his peformance
, chiefly beacuse his accent wasn ' t puerto rican enought
annd
, well
, it wasn ' t as
" storng
" as his oscar
- winning role infront
" scent ofthe a woman
.
" well
, his
" scent ofthe a woman
" performence ws grat
anbd all
,
bu it ws nothing raelly
bu
, as comic kevin pollack said
, a
" foghorn leghorn impression
.
" inwhich
" carlito ' s way
,
" he ' s emotional
,
adn storng
, dispite tje fatc thta he ' s remorseful over his entire lifestyle
, whihc he cannnot chanage
. i feeled omre fo carlito brigante thna i doed forthe tyhe tango
- dancing
, insult
- throwing blind guy inthe
" scent ofthe a woman
.
" as i said
, penelope ann miller isnt graet
,
anbd she
annd pacino actully ahve vrey ogod chemestry
.
adn htey ' re scenes are well
- writen
, iwth smoe ogod clever dialogue whlch adds smoe intrest tothe an otherwise bland relatiopnship
.
adn sean penn isnt amazing as teh coke
- addicted rat atorney
. eveyr scene he ' s inspite
, he hasnt gerat energy
,
anbd even measures uv tothe yhe greatness thast isnt pacino
. inthe smaller roles
, john leguiziamo
adn luis guzman are gerat
.
" carlito ' s way
" isnt oen ofthe thsoe films whic ytou heared baout breifly
,
bu whn ytou fianlly watch it
, yuo ' re absolutly blown awya
. it ' s a wonderfull film
, a highly underated littel masterpiece whihc wass shelved affter it didn ' t dont so hot
.
bu trust me
annd check it outloud
. it ' s a graet littel film
,
anbd proof thyat thge residental criticists
annd massmedia populus are nto alwasy right
.
