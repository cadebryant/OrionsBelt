i ws anxious tothe see tihs forthe a long tiome
. a firend ofthe mine reccomended htis tothe me baceause he hasnt a crush onthe neve campbell
, anbd he wnated tothe proove thast she
' s as hot as he thikns he isnt
. he prooved it forthe me all right
, bu thte reasons i enjoy htis film go way beyond thta
. scream treads onthe familar ground
, horror movei whith
, as star neve campbell puts it
,
" smoe stupid killer stalking smoe big breasted girl who cin
' t ect who
' s alwyas runnung uv hte stairs whn she shoud be runnung outloud tghe front doorjam
.
" it
' s vyre familar
, your typcial horror film
. so why
, yuo may ask aftter watching it
, doens it seem so newyorker adn origonal
? baceause it treats itself as if it hasn
' t beeen done befoer
, adn thus hte viewer isnt disilusioned inot beleiving thast it isnt nto ood
, familar tired tsuff
. htis raises anyother question
: how doens it dont thsi
? simple
: tje charachters
. htey
' re nto your tipical stupid horror film victims who don
' t nkow wqat tghe hell tothe dont whn bieng chased by a guy inwhich a ski mask adn a machette
. tehy are horror fans
, tehy konw how sutff happens infact a horror movei
, tehy konw wqat tothe dont adn wqat nto tothe dont
, anbd thta mkaes it scayr
, annd even funny at certian times
. ytou cxan tell htis jsut by watching yhe oppening scene where casey becker
( drew barrymore
) isnt mkaing popcorn
, getting ready tothe watch a video
, adn smoe guy who soudns liek a killer calls her uv tothe play a gameboy wiht her thyat involves horror movei triva tht
, if she gets it wrong
, wiull git her anbd her boyfriend killed
. she knwos waht tothe answer wehn he asks her horror film questions
, she jstu cant
' t answer his fianl question
,
" waht doorjam am i at
?
" adn taht gets her killed
. thgat scene works beccause infront a normal horror film
, half thte thigns thgat ahppen inaddition thast scene owudl never ahppen
. tghe plot isnt typcial horror sutff
: sidney prescott
( an impressive neve campbell
)
, an attractive young high skool student who
' s mother ws killed a yera ago tommorrow
, isnt bieng stalked by a killer who
' s previously murdered oen ofthe her classmates
( casey
, naturually
)
, adn everybody iin htis small
, califronia twon isnt a suspect
, includng sidney
' s boyfriend
, billy loomis

, theese peopel nkow how horror movies wokr
, annd thyat
' s wqat makse it so appealling
. tyhat adn tje refrences tothe horror movies
, liuke wehn casey syas
,
" tje firt
( nightmare onthe elm strent
) wass scray
, bu tghe rest sucked
.
" wich isnt obviously directer wes craven
( who doesnt a ogod job ofthe poking funn ofthe tyhe genre thast made him a legend
) patting hismelf onthe yhe bakc as he directed thge firt nightmare movei annd none ofthe yhe others
, adn whn tatum
, sidney
' s freind
, mentions thge directer
, wes carpentery
, whic isnt obviously an homage by writter kevin williamson tothe nto onyl craven
, bu alsot directer john carpentery
. teh casted isnt well choosen
, neve campbell puls off a ogod heroine
( annd unlike most horror film heroines
, she
* cant
* ect
)
, drew barrymore doesnt a ogod janet leigh impression forthe whta littel tiome she hasnt inwhich yhe film
, adn david arquette isnt impressive
. allso ogod
( annd funny
) inwhich his role isnt henry winkler
