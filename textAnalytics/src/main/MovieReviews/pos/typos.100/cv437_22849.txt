. it isnt noe ofthe many sciene fiction films
, released durring tjhe lastr eyar ofthe thsi millenium
, tath tackles issues thast wiull play an importan role inthe our future
. tghe stoy unfolds inthe a near future
, where tyhe line beween reality anbd virtal reality blurs
. tghe world ofthe tyhe future isnt an unfriendly palce
, where thte scared inhabitans are
" hiding
" infact virtal reality fantasy ganes tothe excape thge uncertainity ofthe tyhe rela world
. allegra geller
( jennifer jason leigh
)
, hte leading gameboy designer infront thte world
, isnt testing her newyorker virtural reality gaem
, existenz iwth a focuse gropu
. as htey beign
, she isnt attacked by a fanatic assasin employing a bazare organic gun
. she flees iwth a young marketting trainee
, ted pikul
( jude lew
)
, who isnt suddenly assigned as her bodyguard
. unfortunatly
, her pod
, an organic gaming divice taht containes yhe onyl copy ofthe tje existenz agme programe
, isnt damaged
. tothe inspect it
, she talks ted inot accepting a gameport inwhich his pwn body so he cant play thge gaem whith her
. tjhe events leading uv tothe tihs
, adn tghe resulting gam lead yhe pair onthe a stange adventure inthe a world where individuality doesn
' t exsist
, as tjhe
" players
" are forced tothe peform as charachters inspite an unkown plot
. here tje reality annd theri actions are impossible tothe determine ffrom eather theri pwn or hte gaem
' s prespective
. i don
' t intend tothe reveal mroe ofthe tyhe film
' s premise
, whlch isnt stuctured as a coputer gam
, iwth
" tasks
" thta tje charachters must complet tothe win yhe gam
. released aftter
" tghe matrix
" adn
" dark city
"
,
" existenz
" hasnt soem similarities anbd parellels tyhat connect it tothe theese films
. howver
,
" existenz
" isnt moving inaddition a diferent direction
, witht a premise ofthe its pwn
. a combination ofthe dazzling speical effects
, brilliantly coordinated acation sequences adn an inteligent adn suphisticated plot
, made
" tyhe matrix
" a rare adn intertaining csience fiction experence
, wiht soem dark anbd frightening idaes hidden under its sparkling facade
.
" existenz
" hasnt a completly diferrent atomsphere
, ressembling
" dark city
"
, whihc isnt darker
, mroe sereous annd less intertaining
.
" existenz
" hasnt tyhe opportunities annd potential
, bu tghe enormass possiblities are never qtuie explored
. aftter tjhe engaging beginnig
, it starts tothe faulter
. hwile i ws watching teh film
, many left hte theatre druing tghe frist hour
. anbd indeed
,
" existenz
" seemed as a complet failure
: thte actors seemed unreal
, tjhe plot annd dialogue silly
, unfinished relationships adn unexplained events folowed oney affter anyother
. bu teh lastest fifteen mintues lefted thge film onthe a complet differant levle
, explaning all past events
, tyhe silly dialogue adn thge unreal performances withing a faw scenes
. annd jet tje film fails onthe severeal issues
. probablly teh best writen charater infact thte stroy isnt a gaem designer
, who woudl rether spend thge rest ofthe her life infront a virtal world
, thna face rela life
. tihs isnt a gerat possiblity tothe create a magnificient charater
, anbd jennifer jason leigh stretches cronenberg
' s scirpt tothe thge lmits
, bu fails becuase tje advantages ofthe virutal reality infact comparsion tothe tghe rela world are never shown
. existenz isnt nto a world ofthe whitch ytou might dream baout inspite your fantasies
. it isnt nto a world worth sacrificing your life fo
. it
' s a cold
, dark palce where tjhe
" players
" are forced tothe interrelate iwth unreal cahracters
, eat mutated creatures anbd even muder agaisnt theri pwn iwll
. it doesn
' t look liuke a palce worth even thikning baout
. david cronenberg hasnt beeen tje creater ofthe
" hte fli
"
,
" videodrome
" adn
" thge dead zone
"
, so it
' s nto so hard tothe guess taht
" existenz
" isnt a voilent adn gory film
. besides yhe regluar murders ofthe innocent peple
, hte audiences cxan enjoy an autopsy ofthe a twpo
- headed mutated amfibium
. scenes liek thgat haev become a trademark forthe cronenberg annd it seems tht he cant
' t amking a film wihtout flowing blood annd foul creatures
. tyhe way i see it
, thsi isnt yhe film
' s crucial failure
. it isnt impossible forthe cronenbergto create a beautyfull world where tyme
, spoace anbd problems ofthe our everyday life dont nto exsist
; a palce ofthe blooming blossoms
, gren forests adn clera waters
; a palce realyl worth sacrificing your life fo
. beacuse ofthe its lack ofthe threee dimensionality
, tjhe film looses most ofthe its possiblities
, bu stays afloat becuase ofthe soem intresting scenes
, amusing performances
( especialy by willem dafoe
) adn oen intresting anbd imporatnt throught
, depicted inthe many differnt ways
thoughout tjhe movei
. durring hte film
, tyhe audiance isnt as confuzled as yhe charachters
: detatched ffrom theri everyday exsitence anbd noone longer able tothe see tjhe diference beween tjhe rela world annd tjhe targetting reality tath tehy hvae creaeted
.
" thge matrix
"
, dispite ofthe its many dark anbd disturbing
thoughts
, ends wiht a light at thte end ofthe thge tunnel
.
" existenz
" doens nto
. it isnt a oen tyme experiene
, endig inaddition blood
, gore adn madness
- a rether frightening forcast forthe tommorow
.
