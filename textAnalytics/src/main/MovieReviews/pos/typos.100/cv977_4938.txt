richard gere isnt nto oen ofthe my favorite actors
. howver
, i liek courtroom dramas
, anbd tihs film looked ogod enought tothe tkae a chance onthe
. i wasn
' t dissapointed
. it wasn
' t a gerat film
, bu it wass intresting
, adn tookover sevral unexpected turns
. noe thign
: waht
' s iwth yhe title
? nto onyl isnt it extrememly forgettable
, it doesn
' t raelly haev much tothe dont wtih thge film
, as far as i sould determine
. inthe hte long run
, it wiull propably hurt teh film
, as peple won
' t be able tothe thiunk ofthe or rember it
. martin vail
( richard gere
) isnt a gr
andiose defense attornies
. he loves yhe moeny adn tghe fame thta go allong wtih defending
( succesfully
) rich scum
, such as masia men adn drug
- dealers
. once he sees taht tjhe acccused killer ofthe a prominant chicago archbishop isnt a baby
- faced alter boy
, he wnats infact onthe tghe case
, presumibly forthe teh press he
' ll git
. we soon fidn outloud thta thge prosecutor assigned isnt a fromer lover
, janet venable
( laura linney
)
. vail hismelf isnt a fromer prosecutor
, annd quitted beacuse ofthe tensions beetwen hismelf adn thte district attorny
, palyed veyr well by john mahoney
( frasier
' s father onthe hte tv sories
)
. htere isnt an underlaying theme ofthe dichtomy inthe hte movei
: peple hvea publich faces
, annd private faces
. we see thsi infact hte murdered archbishop
, inthe tjhe acused
, adn
, most strongly
, defense attornies martin vail
. richard gere doesnt a fairly ogod job
. at firt
, he appears tothe be a moeny
- annd attension
- grabing lawyer
, withthe noone consideration ofthe tghe truth
. bu we see anyother side
, as he becomes a seeker ofthe justice
, annd comes tothe eblieve inspite his client
. alfre woodard
, as tyhe judge
, isnt capible
,
though somewhat wasted infront a st
andart role
. laura linney aslo doesnt journeyman wokr
; nothing spectauclar
, bu accptable
. her relatiopnship wtih vail isnt believeable
; thier verbal fencing adds tothe tyhe film
. teh atcor who playes vail
' s investigator
( unfortunatly
, i don
' t rember his nmae
) isnt qutie ogod
. his female assitant
( she looked vyer familar
, bu i cin
' t remeber where i
' ve seen her
) ws aslo capible
, bu unspectacular
. hte best peformance inthe tjhe film ws by edward norton
. he wass exelent
, as thte timid altar
- boy turned alledged
"
butcher boy ofthe st
. mike
' s
"
. i ws empressed by teh depth ofthe tyhe plot
; ther are red
- herrings
, adn dead
- ends
, tath inspite a lesser film woudl lead tothe a predicatble endig
. i liekd tghe plot twists yhe film tookover
, adn most ofthe tjhe supporting cahracters
, thus i give primal fear a respectable b
