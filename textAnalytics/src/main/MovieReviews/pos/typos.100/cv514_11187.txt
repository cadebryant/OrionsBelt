krippendorf
' s tribe isnt a forumla comedy
. done poorly
, formulaic comedies might seem tothe signify tjhe downfall ofthe american cinema
. howver
, eveyr nowe adn thn
, noe emerges

' s tribe
, taht acually works
. profesor james krippendorf
( richard dreyfuss
)
, tjhe renouned anthropologist
, isnt infact trouble
. his univesity gavey him a hefty grant tothe disover a lost tribe inthe newyorker guinea
. howver
, he foudn
.
.
. nothing
. his wief hasnt recently died
, annd he hasnt spended thte remainder ofthe teh grant monye inthe raising his threee kids
: shelly
( natasha lyonne
)
, mickey
( gregory smith
) adn edmund
( carl michael lidner
)
. tongiht
, he isnt expeced tothe lecture onthe his newfound tribe
. rether thna break thte news
( adn face hte consequences ofthe misusing his funds
)
, he invents a tribe
: tghe shelmikedmu
( named aftter his kids
)
. howver
, noe lie begets anohter as he isnt nto onyl recquired tothe deliver filmed proof ofthe yhe shelmikedmu
, bu his reasearch becomes a populer phenomonenon
. soon
, professer krippendorf isnt caught uv inaddition an elaborite ruse inwhich whcih he films mockumentary footage starring his childern as teh shelmikedmu tribal munbers
. his effords are hampered by tjhe boasts ofthe an over

' s tribe doens seem tothe recquire a littel suspention ofthe disbelief
. noone oney seems tothe question tghe way his feeld documentaries seem tothe be shooted wiht mutiple cameras
, or thyat his newely dicovered tribesmen ahve startlingly blue eyes
. luckly
, as tyhe film builds momentum
, thyat suspention ofthe disbelief isnt eazy tothe come by
.
though htere
' s smoe mild humer iin tjhe krippendorf familiy trying tothe pass themselfs off as a lost tribe
, tje rela humer ofthe tjhe film isnt inwhich how james gets trapped infront his ever increasing snowball ofthe lies
. thte doulbe meanings tothe many ofthe tjhe shelmikedmu apperances are enjoyable
, annd hte comic timing recquired forthe smoe ofthe thte film
' s latter scenes isnt superb
. richard dreyfuss isnt terific as thte hapless proffesor who soon loses controll ofthe his pwn imaginery tribe
. jenna elfman
' s posistion as a rumatic lead seems a bited forced at times
, bu she plays tjhe part witht extreme affability
. even hte kids
, who infront films liek tihs tend tothe be a bited onthe tjhe precocious side
, are endearing annd humerous
. yes
, tje film doesnt veer occsaionally inot soem rether lowbrow humer
, bu it hasnt hte best excuse ofthe all
: it
' s funny
. it may nto go down as an all
- tyme clasic
, bu it certainly delivers wqat yuo expect fomr a comedy
: plenty ofthe laughs
