krippendorf ' s tribe isnt a forumla comedy
. done poorly
, formulaic comedies might seem tothe signify yhe downfall ofthe american cinema
.
howver
, eveyr nowe
adn
hten
, oney emerges
, liuke krippendorf ' s tribe
, thyat accually works
. proffesor james krippendorf
( richard dreyfuss
)
, hte reknowned anthropologist
, isnt infront trouble
. his universty gavey him a hefty grant tothe dicover a lost tribe inthe newyorker guinea
.
howver
, he foudn
.
.
. nothing
. his wief hasnt recently died
,
anbd he hasnt spended teh remainder ofthe teh grant monay iin raising his threee kids
: shelly
( natasha lyonne
)
, mickey
( gregory smith
)
adn edmund
( carl michael lidner
)
. tongiht
, he isnt expeced tothe lecture onthe his newfound tribe
. rether thna break teh news
(
anbd face teh consequences ofthe misusing his funds
)
, he invents a tribe
: thte shelmikedmu
( named aftter his kids
)
.
howver
, oen lie begets anyother as he isnt nto onyl requred tothe deliver filmed proof ofthe yhe shelmikedmu
,
bu his reasearch becomes a populare phenomonenon
. soon
, profesor krippendorf isnt caught uv infront an elaborite ruse infront whlch he films mockumentary footage starring his childen as thge shelmikedmu tribal munbers
. his effords are hampered by thte boasts ofthe an over
- eeger collegue
, veronica micelli
( jenna elfman
)
,
anbd thge intense scrutinity ofthe a rival anthropologist
, ruth allen
( lily tomlin
)
. krippendorf ' s tribe doens seem tothe recquire a littel suspention ofthe disbelief
. noone oney seems tothe question yhe way his feeld documentaries seem tothe be shooted wiht mutiple cameras
, or thast his newely dicovered tribesmen hve startlingly blue eyes
. luckly
, as hte film builds momentum
, tyhat suspention ofthe disbelief isnt eazy tothe come by
.
though htere ' s soem mild humer inaddition tje krippendorf famaly trying tothe pass themselfs off as a lost tribe
, hte rela humer ofthe tje film isnt inthe how james gets trapped iin his ever increasing snowball ofthe lies
. thte doulbe meanings tothe many ofthe tjhe shelmikedmu apperances are enjoyable
,
adn thge comic timing requred fo soem ofthe thte film ' s latter scenes isnt superb
. richard dreyfuss isnt terific as tyhe hapless proffesor who soon loses controll ofthe his pwn imagenary tribe
. jenna elfman ' s postion as a rumatic lead seems a bited forced at times
,
bu she plays tyhe part withthe extreme affability
. even tghe kids
, who inthe films liek thsi tend tothe be a bited onthe yhe precocious side
, are endearing
annd humorosu
. yes
, tjhe film doesnt veer occasioanlly inot soem rether lowbrow humer
,
bu it hasnt tghe best excuse ofthe all
: it ' s funny
. it may nto go down as an all
- tiome clasic
,
bu it certainly delivers whta ytou expect fomr a comedy
: plenty ofthe laughs
