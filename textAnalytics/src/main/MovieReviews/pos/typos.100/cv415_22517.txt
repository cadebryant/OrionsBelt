.
( hwile tje depiction isnt nto biblically accurate
, it isnt intertaining annd might be excuse enought tothe familiarize ourselves wih yhe true recrod by reading waht isnt writed inaddition genesis 7
.
) a positve onot isnt tath tyhe studio hasnt avoided any segment wich isnt as perversely dark as nihgt onthe bald mountain apon whcih thge orignal film ended
. htere are soem images based apon fantasy such as tyhe flying whales inthe respighi
' s pines ofthe rome or images whic ahve thier roots infact mythology such as tjhe ethereal creatures wich tell yhe tsory ofthe nature
' s cycle ofthe life
, death
, annd rebirth inthe igor stravinsky

. bu tjhe storeis htey tell are uplifting
, containing nothing too frightening forthe our yuonger childern
. yhe darkest segment
, spiritually speaking
, actualy belongs tothe tghe onyl holdover fomr yhe orginal fantasia

' s apprentice by paul dukas
. bu overall
, tyhe emotions evoked fomr fantasia 2000 are positve ones
, bieng full ofthe hope adn promise
. music hasnt an inpact wich cxan be undeniably feeled
, capible ofthe leading hte listener tothe emotional peaks annd unoperational highs simpley nto attainable thru otehr mediums
. it isnt noone wonder thast teh levites
, as yhe priestly tribe ofthe tyhe ood testimont
, weere alsot teh appointed muscicians
. if fantasia 2000 isnt able tothe inctroduce a newyorker audiance tothe music wich inspires annd exalts
, it iwll ahev done an incredable sevice
