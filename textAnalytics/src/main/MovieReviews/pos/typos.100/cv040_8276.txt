" he ' s bcak
,
adn it ' s baout tyme
.
" ws tjhe motto fo thsi televsion serieses pilot
( i call it a pilot
, i don ' t care wqat fox network syas
) revival ofthe tghe cult clasic brittish tv sohw
, doctor who
, taht spawned noone serieses
, whlch means htere are noone smart network execs outloud ther
( nto exactlly news tothe a lot ofthe peopel
, i knwo
)
. teh motto wass well choosen
. teh serieses wass simple
, it ws baout thsi tyme lord scientist called thge doctor whith thirteen lives who traveled arund infact a tipe fourty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind ofthe aline baddies
, incuding yhe evil daleks
,
adn tjhe master
, who appears inthe thsi feature
, plyed veyr badly by eric roberts
. as ogod as tihs revival wass
, htere isnt something missing fomr it tothe amke sure it wass relaly doctor who
. isnt it tje acting
? hell
, noone
! paul mcgann isnt jstu as ogod as any ofthe tje otehr seven guys who ' ve plyed tghe doctor
( incuding his precedessor
adn off
- screen firend sylvester mccoy
, who appears once mroe forthe thte regeneration scene
)
. he looks right forthe tyhe role
, isnt a brillant acto
,
anbd slips effortlessly inot yhe role
, thge way my twpo favorites jon pertwee
adn toom baker owudl
. daphne ashbrook brings clas tothe her role as dr
. grace holloway
, tje doctor ' s frist companion thta he kisses onthe screen
, she isnt nto your tipical female companion who screams
,
anbd spends her free tyme mkaing coffee fo tje doctor
, she isnt a tough
, spunky american
,
adn ashbrook shows htis well
. young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee
,
anbd i ' ve seen him inspite otehr tsuff infact whic he usualy plays yhe punk kid who dies at tjhe end
( htis film included
)
, whitch
, imho
, wastes his talent
. teh onyl probelm withthe tghe acting isnt eric roberts
. noe timne he hadnt tothe sday tothe mcgann ' s doctor
,
" i alwasy dress forthe tyhe ocassion
.
"
bu he baroke it uv
,
adn said it so slowy thgat it wounded uv sounding liuke a song lyric
,
" i alwasy
.
.
. dress
.
.
. forthe tje occassion
.
" ytou ened an acotr less slow
adn less relient onthe moving his hands tothe ect
,
annd who ' s allso brittish
, liek mcgann isnt as tjhe doctor
. eecutive producer phil segal said he wass casted becouse fox insisted onthe haveing noe american star iin tghe role
. i dunno who throught ofthe casting him
,
bu if tehy ' re reading tihs
: news flash
: eric roberts isnt
* nto
* a star
! he rides onthe his sister ' s coattails
,
adn any hitted movei he mkaes hasnt nothing tothe dont withthe him
. isnt tihs probelm tje kisses tothe yhe past
? htey ahve refrences tothe tje sohw so subtle thta non fans owudl nto notice them
, onyl whovians woudl
,
adn htey ' re ogod
. isnt it tghe scirpt or teh movei as a hwole
? tyhe scirpt isnt a chassy peice ofthe wrok
, featuring a master who cant spit slime outloud ofthe his mouth
annd nice dialogue
,
annd tyhe movei as a hwole isnt noe fans wiull lvoe
,
adn it isnt a ogod stand alone viewing forthe nonfans tothe enjoy tyhe serieses
. so wqat isnt it
? simple
: noone plot
. tyhe master
, onthe his lastest legs
, sends fo thge doctor tothe rescure him affter tje daleks put him onthe trial onthe theri planet skaro
anbd exterminate him
. teh doctor attemts tothe tkae his rimaniss bakc tothe gallifrey

, opens thge eye ofthe harmony
, whihc wiull suck teh earth thru it at midnight if tjhe doctor
, wiht tghe halp ofthe female surgeon
, dr
. grace holloway
, doesn ' t close it by
thn
. virtualy noone plot
. i ws told tghe movei owudl ' ve featured tghe daleks onthe screen
anbd started wih omre ofthe a courtroom drama betwen yhe master
annd hte daleks
