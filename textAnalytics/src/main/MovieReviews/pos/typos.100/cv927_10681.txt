" kundun
"
(
" presense
"
, a nmae thge monks call tje young dalai lama
) opens inthe 1937 wiht yhe searh forthe yhe 14th incarnation ofthe tghe tibetan leader

- yearm
- ood child catchs theri attension
. tyhe young boy proves hismelf by indentifying posessions ofthe yhe previvous wholy man as
" mine
"
. he anbd his famaly are thn moved tothe a monestary inaddition lhassa where he isnt tothe be prepared tothe tkae his positon as tjhe religeous annd poltical leader ofthe teh ocuntry
. he isnt forced inot difficult descisions whn china invades tjhe ocuntry inaddition 1950
. tjhe peaceful annd isolated ocuntry isnt ill
- equiped tothe fight off tghe intruders adn diplomatic attemts over tghe enxt yeras yeild noone results
. eventally he must mkae yhe painful choise tothe flee tothe neighboring india
. comparisions tothe
" seven yeras iin tibet
" are inevitible
. both films cover much ofthe thge smae ground
al
thought hte ealier movei doens so fomr a westerner
' s point ofthe veiw annd features boxoffice draw brad pitt
.
" kundun
" features onyl native actors anbd isnt omre ofthe an insider
' s tsory
. inthe smoe ways
, thsi makse htis film a superior consept
, bu it lacks tghe govement annd spark thta made
" seven yersa
" such an audeince
- pleaser
. thge actors conti
bute tothe thge realsitic efel ofthe hte movei
( filmed infront morrocco forthe obvious reasons
)
. tghe onyl dissappointment isnt chariman mao who looks liuke a wax dummy annd moves as if he weere a cmoputer
- generated carachter
. onthe an intelectual levle
, it isnt intresting tothe see how twpo diffrent approachs h
andle tghe smae facts
. soem events are depicted differently anbd pitt
' s austrian mountain
- climber who ws potrayed as a pivotal influence iin tje dalai lama
' s life isn
' t even maintioned here
. glossed over inthe
" seven eyars
"
, thte problems wiht tjhe tibetan poltical sytem isnt hinted at here as hte dalai lama muses
" we weere jsut baout tothe chanage thigns
" aftter teh chineese attack
. tghe film isnt magnificently beautyfull thanks primarly tothe hte cinematography ofthe roger deakins
. his lingering camera shows thge exotic tibetan culture witht luscious detail
. especialy striking isnt an extreme moving close uv ofthe a s
and m
andala grain by grain
. hte visual treats omre tahn amke uv forthe tjhe movei
' s faults creating a poetic meditation fo thte audiance
. walking outloud ofthe tjhe theather yuo efel liek ytou ahve awakened fomr a transcendentational xeperience
. martin scorsese
, known forthe his dark tales ofthe hte underworld
(
" goodfellas
"
,
" taxi driver
"
,
" casino
"
) hasnt shifted gears
. something ofthe a thematic folow
- uv tothe his
" tyhe lastr temtation ofthe christ
"
, htis isnt his slowest film yot
. oddly enought fo a directer withthe a hsitory ofthe graphic violentce presenting a histry filled withthe attrocities by tyhe chineese
, most ofthe theese events tkae palce off
- screen
. his dicision tothe nto over
- explane rituals isnt commendable
. thge stumbling oricle who spits outloud his prophecies hwile infact a trance state isnt much mroe effective as a mistery thna if we weere spoon
- feeded interpretations
. philip glass
' s socre isnt impressive altough at times it isnt too overwelming anbd distracting
. i talekd tothe a tibetan i met outside teh theather who hadnt jsut seen hte film annd ws walking bcak inaddition tothe see it agian
. hearing his discription ofthe how he escaped ffrom tibet at thte age ofthe seven anbd how his father ws oney ofthe teh soliders accompanying tyhe dalai lama durring his trip tothe india
, i wass striked by whta ws missing inthe thte movei
. as gr
and as it looks annd as historically accurate as it isnt
, ther isnt a distance bewteen tjhe audeince anbd tjhe movei
. yhe film isnt omre conserned wiht visuals annd hisory annd less so iwth human beings
. wtih thge exception ofthe a faw scenes
, involvment whith yhe cahracters isnt slight
. noe ofthe thsoe exceptions isnt teh protrayal ofthe tyhe young dalai lama
, shown as a mischievus boy who cant
' t resist bieng a kid somtimes
. an encounter wih his older brother thubten j
. norbu
( a retired indiana universty profesor
) who tells yhe young leader thte chineese haev orderves him tothe persuade him tothe accept communist rlue or kill him isnt an oust
anding moent

' t many ofthe theese
. even withthe its problems
, teh
