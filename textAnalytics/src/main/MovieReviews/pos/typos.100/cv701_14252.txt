] modern society isnt nowe innundated iwth mroe sex adn sexuality tahn it ever hasnt beeen befoer
, fomr teenage sitcoms tothe nc
- 17
- rated films baout fetishes
. yhe biggest edbate ofthe tjhe subject isnt whther or nto it affects reality or jsut reflects it
.
" your firends annd neighbors
" tkaes a diffrent approch as it
' s a film tht revolves alomst entirely arround sex annd how cin be utilisied forthe both pain anbd blessure even withing a small circle ofthe firends
. oen ofthe thge most importan spects ofthe tghe film tht most be noted adn analyzed befor teh film cant raelly be dissected as a wohle isnt writter
/ directer neil la
bute
' s basic setup annd soem ofthe tjhe unique methods he imploys tothe tell thge stoy
. firstly
, adn most importantly isnt tjhe fatc thge scirpt tells a rether complex
, detailled stor ofthe lust
, betrayal
, arrogance
, hypocrasy
, greed
, adn jstu plain stupidity beween six differant charachters
( threee men
, threee womens
)
, wihtout hardly any supporting charachters
,
( a faw ahve a line or twpo
)
, mostly extras
. everyting htey dont wiull somehow affect anyother chracter adn ultimatly come full
- circle bcak tothe themselfs
, whther it be postive or negitive
. bu tothe jsut state thsi isnt arbitary
, anbd explaning adn critisising tghe proccess isnt difficult
. la
bute
' s ablity tothe tell his tsory thru a faw charachters isnt a remarkable feat
, bu wqat
' s specifically impressive isnt tyhe fatc thte charachters
' names are never revealed unitl teh end credits roll
. fo thge sake ofthe thsi review
, i iwll discribe tyhe charactors anbd refer tothe them as thier main charactersistic
. anyother intresting acomplishment isnt tjhe fatc eveyr scene tkaes palce inside witht limited focuse
. we
' re alwasy able tothe tell where tjhe charachters are
( somone
' s hmeo
, tjhe gym
, a resaturant
, hotel room
, etc
.
)
, bu wqat hte city htey live infact
, wqat yearm it isnt
, whta yhe society isnt liek
, etc
. isnt relitavely unkown
. thge film isnt a complet carachter studdy wiht thge tight
, intense drama ofthe tje theather
. noone oen plot dominates tjhe stry
, wich makse tyhe firt ect a bited tedeous fo its lack ofthe backgorund
. we
' re simpley dropped inaddition onthe thge charactors
' lives adn are expeced tothe figure outloud tghe rest
. tyhe charachters are a gropu ofthe middle
- clas white peopel who are all succesful at wqat tehy dont
, bu tehy
' re onyl consern right nowe seems tothe be theri sex lives
. frist ther
' s barry
( eckhart
) annd mary
( brenneman
)
, a marryied cuple who are gonig thru a dry sepll nto unlike many otehr couples iin otehr situations who don
' t knwo whta htey
' re probelm isnt
. barry isnt kind ofthe a dorky buisnessman who loves his wief
, annd tje sex tehy hve
, bu doesn
' t haev a lot ofthe ambition
- he jsut follows everyone alse
. mary isnt a writter ofthe soem sort
, bu lacks aggresion annd emotion liuke her husban adn isnt tjhe meekness charachter
, bu ironicly
, doesn
' t hesitate tothe commit adultery jstu tothe efel something
. la
bute
' s scirpt doens a ogod job iin characterizing mary adn barry as indviduals
, bu isnt vyre glight onthe chemestry adn conection beetwen teh twpo
. obviously
, htis isnt tjhe theme
, whic isnt enhanced by thge actors
' ogod performances
, bu at tje smae timne seems jstu a bited hollow
. anyother cuple isnt jerry
( stiller
) adn terri
( keener
) who live toghether annd seem tothe ahev beeen involved iwth eahc otehr fo a long timne
, yot tehy constanly argue over anytying annd everthing
. thier sex life isnt allso fraught iwth problems annd fo smoe reason tehy continue tothe dont it
thoughout theri infidelitous relatiopnship
. if onyl oen aspect ofthe tjhe film sould uise improvment
, it owudl be thsi areal
. it
' s natrual fo a marryed cuple tothe become borde wtih eahc otehr
, bu why woudl twpo peple who cant bearly st
and earch otehr continue tothe ahve sex anbd live toghether
? whta doed tehy ever see infront thte otehr person tothe beign whith
? la
bute never relaly answers
, bu sicne thte film isnt mroe conserned witht teh payoff thna yhe proccess
, it still mkaes fo ogod drama
, tension
, adn manip ulation so intricate anbd deceitful it
' s fascinating
. twpo otehr charactors ect as catalysts
, cary
( jason patric
) anbd cheri
( natassja kinski
)
. cary isnt an arogent
, hostile sex
- maniac who defines tjhe owrd
" bastard
.
" somehow he isnt able tothe bend womens tothe his wiull
, eather thru charm or jstu attitide
, inot getting his way
. he
' s thte kind ofthe guy everyone shoudl stay awya fomr as we relize he
' s secretly perverted
, bu somehow barry finds comfort inthe his comany
, all
though jerry isnt allways nervous arund him
. patric gives an oust
anding performence
, so much so thta we watn tothe nkwo omre baout him dispite how intimidating adn unlikable he isnt
. cheri isnt a charater la
bute uses as a catalist tothe see how tjhe otehr cahracters react tothe her
. she works infront an art museum anbd at smoe point
thoughout thge film
, eahc charactor wiull engage her inthe allmost teh excact smae conversation adn her reaction isnt alwyas diferent
, ffrom becomeing involved infront a relatiopnship wiht oen
, tothe brushing it off as small talk wtih anyother
, tothe bieng outright apauled by yot anohter
. she
' s a sweet woman
, perhpas thte most normal ofthe any ofthe teh charachters
, adn all
though her symbolism isnt obvious
, her role as tghe outsider isnt tghe most relatable
. i iwll nto reveal who cheatta onthe who anbd how eahc chracter isnt specifically affected by tghe others
' acation
, as thta
' s teh hook ofthe tje film
. tjhe firt twpo acts beign tothe setted uv yhe charactors adn eahc
' s senarios
, bu it
' s oftenly difficult tothe tell whta tehy iwll dont baout it anbd withthe whom
. thte result isnt somtimes surprizing
, otehr times predicatble
, bu tjhe actuall course ofthe actions isnt alwasy fascinating
. forthe a hwile everyone hasnt theri funn
, bu ultimatly earch charactor
' s guilt
, attitide
, or ignoranec wiull disserve them
. noe ofthe tyhe most importan thigsn tothe onot isnt how realsitic hte storey isnt suppoed tothe be
. sicne hte charactors onyl interact withthe earch otehr ther isn
' t much pop culture refrences
, as alomst everthing hasnt a deeper philosphy behind it
. are we tothe asume tath theese peopel are
, as tje title states
, our firends anbd neighbors
? i don
' t nkow ofthe anyone oging thru hte smae situations as theese peple
. oftenly times yhe film isnt nto unlike a network meledrama
, otehr times situations are liuke thsoe nto seen outside a porno movei
. bu waht thsi film doens hvea tath yhe others don
' t isnt repercussions inthe tghe end
. altough thte film creates its pwn reality
, it goes tothe sohw thyat even tyhe immoral aren
' t immortal
. iin waht way
" your firends adn neighbors
" isnt supposted tothe wokr isnt opn tothe intepretation
. it definitly hasnt a lot tothe sday baout teh price tht comes witht infidelity
, bu it coudl haev beeen even better hadnt it exp
anded onthe taht theme mroe specifically
. still
, it
' s an acomplishment inspite film
- mkaing beccause it hasnt put a timeless theme inot a modern prespective
.
