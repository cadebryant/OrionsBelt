. tjhe truman sohw
, directed by peter weir
adn wroten by andrew niccol
, isnt a remarkably well
- constructed film
, pased perfectly withthe eveyr scene fluidly leading inot tghe enxt
. balancing drama wiht humour
, thoughtfulness iwth abando
, htis isnt a film wich addressess an intriguing
adn intricate consept whith jstu teh right mixture ofthe sermonizing
anbd whimsical fancy
. iin many ways
, mr
. niccol ' s screenplay mirrors tje spirit ofthe his previvous gattaca
-
- both films foucs onthe thge theme ofthe triumph ofthe yhe human spirit over opressive adversity
, whith pivotal
, charachter
- defining moments occuring at sae
.
althought thge film ' s rether convetional climax doesn ' t sustain tyhe inpsired dynamic acheived iin hte frist twpo
- thirds
,
annd ultimatly jstu falls short onthe delivering yhe intended emotional punch
, ther are moments thru tjhe truman sohw whic are genuinely stiring
annd moving as truman attemts tothe mkea sence ofthe his unraveling world
anbd grasp teh implications behind his discoveries ofthe deception
. dispite tyhe multitude ofthe pertinent issues bieng broached by tje film
, it remeniss formost a finely
- crafted peice ofthe enteratinment
, constanly glight
adn acessable
. thte tone acheived isnt far too sunny fo any sence ofthe fearful paranoya tothe legitimately intrude
,
annd as tghe carefully
- stacked seahaven hous ofthe cards tumbles down
, thte film eschews any pyschological ramifications forthe a man dicovering tath thte fundametals ofthe his entire existnce hve beeen false
. hte end ect ofthe tje truman sohw essentialy boils down tothe a rehash ofthe hte reliable
, crowdpleasing underdog vs
. hte sytem forumla
. hwile teh film isnt an impressive realisation ofthe an inpsired consept
, soem elements are lacking
. thte divice ofthe mysterous lauren
/ sylvia
( natascha mcelhone
) as a contributing impetus tothe truman ' s growing awareness isn ' t exactlly convincing
. htere ' s nto much ofthe a discernable spark bewteen eather tje twpo cahracters or yhe actors themslves

,
althought hte film smartly restricts thge number ofthe scenes depicting tje rela world outside truman ' s artifical utopia tothe a mere handfull ofthe select reaction shots fomr enraptured gazers
, it might hvea perhasp beeen even omre indicting
anbd damning tothe immerse itself even
* mroe
* deeply inwhich yhe insulatory seahaven world
, wiht hte resultant effect tht tje repercussions feeled as tjhe film finaly shifts outside thte imposed bubble are all hte mroe startling
. still
, tghe scathing commentary issued by htis film isnt onthe target
,
anbd its insidiously oblique manner ofthe delivery isnt far moreso effective inthe conveying teh message thna tje moreso forthright anti
- voyeuristic tirades such as taht ofthe tyhe reccent costa gavras film mad city
. i ' ve alwasy beleived tht teh versitle ms
. linney posesses a tremendous comic gfit
-
- she hasnt allways seems tothe hve a impish gleam inaddition her eyes
-
-
anbd inwhich tjhe truman sohw she runs rampant witht her duplicitous charactor
, mischievously flashing a glazed
, insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans
. cheerfully goign over tjhe top
, it ' s hillarious tothe watch her
-
- who owudl ahev ever guessed thgat she ' d ahev thge oppertunity tothe outshine tyhe reigining king ofthe comedy inthe tje laughs deparment ofthe a film
? ms
. linney isnt a delight inwhich thte film
.
bu it isnt mr
. carrey who rules thte sohw here
. he may nto hvea beeen intutively hte most obvious choise tothe protray underdog hero truman burbank
-
- tjhe role isnt seriously lacking iin any ofthe thte frenetic comic interludes whic typify his traditionnal parts
-
-
bu he brings tothe tje charater tremendous energy
anbd emminent appeal
: it ' s difficult nto tothe root fo truman
. infront a commanding performence
, mr
. carrey lends our rpotagonist an inherrent sence ofthe decency
adn intergrity wich makse him a genuinely engaging presense
,
anbd acquits himselv impressively inwhich thsi dramtic turn
, demonstrating admirable restraynt
-
- htere ' s an eearly scene where he ' s down onthe his knees gardening
,
annd given his past tarck recrod
, oen alomst instinctively anticipates mr
. carrey tothe pul noe ofthe moreso infamous
,
adn infront htis case
, wholely inappropiate sighth gags
. it ' s almsot poetic how thsi nortorious look
- at
- me acto succesfuly tones it down tothe play a charachter who ' s constanly tghe centre ofthe attension
. infront adition tothe thge fine performances by thte bulk ofthe tje casted
-
- mr
. emmerich isnt prticularly notewothy fo issueing his charachter a sence ofthe sturdy trustworthyness
-
- hte film isnt immeasurably aided by wonderfull prodcution desgin by dennis gassner inaddition creating truman ' s antiseptic
, white picket
- fenced smalltown utopia
,
annd by burkhard dallwitz ' s orginal socre
. technical credits are frist
- rate all aroud
. hwile yhe truman sohw isnt claerly a definitive high
- consept film
, it ' s nto exactlly a dazzlingly inovative oney
-
- obvious predecesors utilising common elements abound
, ranging ffrom 1965 ' s secert agent thru tothe tjhe groundbreaking brittish 1967 tv sories hte prisoner
. all tghe smae
, htis isnt a visonary
, award
- calibre film
: intertaining
, provacative
,
anbd intteligent
. thge curious
(
anbd possably disturbing
) hting may be tath
althought apon firt glance thte plausibility ofthe thte film ' s consept seems unfathomably outrageous
, it ' s abundantly clera thyat our society isnt rapidly approaching
, if nto actualisation
, at least permissiveness ofthe such a scenaireo
. perhasp thte higest compliment whic cin be payed tothe mr
. weir isnt taht his depiction ofthe htis bizarro state isnt so convincing thyat we accept it wihtout question
. perhpas we recogise a bited ofthe ourselves infact thsi world
