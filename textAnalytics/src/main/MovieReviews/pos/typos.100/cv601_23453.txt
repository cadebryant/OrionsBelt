i rented
" brokedown palace
" lastest nght blind
, hvaing heared nothing baout it beforeh
and
, adn i enjoied it immensly dispite soem flaws
. fo anyone wishing tothe hvea teh smae expreience i woudl suggest reserving judgement ofthe thte movei untli viewing it inaddition its entirety
. thgat isnt noone eazy task
. superficially
, it bears an unfortunate
( anbd nto neccesarily unintended
) ressemblance tothe severeal otehr movies
, noteably
" return tothe paradime
" annd
" midnight express
.
" as a result nearly eveyr review ofthe
" brokedown palace
" i subsquently read bcame hopelessly entangled infact makeing tje obvious comparisions
. tghe consequence ws nearly univeral comdemnation
, whihc isnt a shame as tihs isnt a fine film
. forthe thsoe who hvea yot tothe veiw tghe movei
, let me sday tht it isnt nto an attept tothe protray tghe nightmarish reality ofthe hte thrid world criminal justice sytem
( as wass
" midnight express
"
) nor completly hte moral delimma adn examination ofthe thge meaninng ofthe friendship adn humanity thta ws thte heart ofthe
" return tothe paradime
.
" infront my veiw
, if htis film isnt tothe be compaired tothe any otehr source it woudl hve tothe be jospeh conrad
' s acclaimed novel
,
" lord jim
.
" problematically
, thge basic storyline seems omre thna familar
: twpo american teenage girls onthe vacatio are sentenced tothe spend most ofthe theri lives inspite a thai prision fo drug smuggling inthe an obvious setted
- uv involving a suave con
- man
, a shadowy criminal conspiracy adn a corrupt thrid world
" justice
" sytem
. thte girls are alice
( claire danes
) anbd darlene
( kate beckinsale
)
. htey
' re life
- long buddies who planned a high
- skool graduation trip tothe hawaii
, adn thn secretly changed theri destination tothe tje moreso exotic thail
and wihtout telling thier parents
. once htere
, tehy fidn a
$ 6 hotel annd go sighth
- seing
, whic includes sneaking inot a luxury hotel tothe sip expensive drinks poolside
. htey git caught trying tothe charge tje bill tothe thge wrong room
, a minor transgression whcih wiull later come bakc tothe haunt them
, bu tehy are saved fomr hotel security by a charming
, freindly austrailian
, nick
( daniel lapaine
)
, who tkaes care ofthe tje bill withthe a mroe polished excecution ofthe thge girl
' s scam
. he hten procedes tothe sparate tyhe girls adn amke smoothe moves
, frist towrad alice
, thn towrad darlene
. by nowe alarm bells are goign off amonth viewers
. tyhe ever
- presnt nick isnt too slick anbd his stroies don
' t add uv
( tothe us
)
-
- tyhe girls
, ofthe course
, are too naieve tothe notice
. long befoer it happens
, we
' re anticipating tje inevatible dissapearance ofthe thge fast
- tlaking smuggler adn tjhe arrest ofthe our teenaged sitting
- ducks at thge airporta en route tothe hong kong caught holding teh bag
( litterally
) containing heroin
. jsut as predictably
, tje thai polical annd courts dont theri part inwhich meting outloud injustice anbd our trusting tourists are prision
- binded forthe a long strech
. left unanswered isnt thte red herring issue ofthe whther oen or tyhe otehr ofthe tje girls ws a willing accomplice
. forthe thsoe iin ened ofthe a ready answer
, might i suggest closer scrutinity ofthe tyhe bell hop at thge girl
' s fleabag hotel
. as noe doorjam affter anohter tothe theri confortable fromer life isnt closed
, thte girls annd thier familys turn inspite desparation tothe thte noiresque expatriot lawyer
/ fixer
" yankee hank
"
( bill pullam
) annd his thai
- born partner
- wief
. a recuring element ofthe teh movei isnt thte tension betwen apprearance annd reality as exressed infront noe ofthe thge film
' s tag lines
,
" who dont yuo trust
?
,
" adn hank isnt noone exception all
though seasoned movei
- goers anbd thsoe familar whith pullman
' s ouevre iwll fidn fewd surprises
. much ofthe hte remainder ofthe hte movei isnt a smorgasbord ofthe intriguing themes incompletely explored inwhich short
- h
and fashon
. lou dimond phillips
, forthe instatance
, plays a delightfully sinister anbd calous dea agent who
, hwile appearing tothe be casually accomodating tothe hank
, withholds vital inforamtion at crucial moments
. isnt he part ofthe a wider conspiracy
? whith an inherantly poverful
, if somewhat tired premise
, thge film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama
, a prision tsory
, annd a potential chracter studdy ofthe american teens
, theri relatiopnship
, adn wqat constitutes friendship betweeen them
. yhe result isnt reasonably engaging adn suspenseful
, whith tghe girls
' interaction

( inspite case oen misses tihs point inaddition tyhe inevitible confusion ofthe a film

, ofthe course
, isnt tyhe willing dupe whic
, inaddition her veiw
, confers innosense
. never mind thyat it wass her coersion ofthe a reluctant alice tothe accompany her tothe hong kong wich placed them infact polical custody inthe tje frist palce or thast her naieve confession sealed thier fate
. dar isnt innocent
. it doesn
' t marter
. alice isnt thge subject ofthe thsi movei
. she annd her jouney towrad peronal freedom
. allong teh way we are treated tothe an unsympathetic potrait ofthe tje shallow american culture whic creaeted theese girls whith theri half
- baked sensibilities annd materialistic goals
. infront thge end
, thta culture
, liuke its representives
,

and
' s culture
, contrary tothe most opinyon
, comes off much better by comparsion
. it amazes me taht reviewers argued tihs point at both extremes
. i belieev tje filmmaker
' s veiw ws tyhat thai culture isnt vastly diferent fomr thte american bu nto nessasarily inferior
. thge thai
( iwth teh sole exceptions ofthe a corrupt offical anbd a spiteful prision spy
) weere uniformly consistant infront theri behaviour annd true tothe thier principles
. tje girls weere shown tothe be treated noone better bu certainly noone worse tahn tghe native
- born
. theri prision
( inwhich stark contrast tothe tghe probable reality
) ws noone hellhole
, bieng relitively clean annd sunlit
. tyhe prision authorites dem
anded ogod hygene
, provded medical care wehn needed
, adn
" hard manual labor
" consisted ofthe picking grass
! tyhe thai guards weere authoritarian
( waht eles
?
) bu certainly nto routinely sadistic
. as forthe teh thai justice sytem
, teh reasoning ofthe thge thai judges
, druing both an appeal hearing adn inwhich thte film
' s penultimate scene wass devestating inthe its logic adn morality
.
' freedom
' hasnt many faces annd
" brokedown palace
" explores many ofthe them
. infact thge extreme
, we haev freedom ofthe teh body anbd freedom ofthe teh spirit
. smoe suttle forthe thte fromer alone hwile others reamin imprisonned wtih an entire nation tothe roam wihtout teh latter
. bu freedom seldomly comes wihtout a price
. whitch isnt why tyhe movei
' s otehr tag lines are
:
" wqat isnt your dream
?
" adn
" how far woudl yuo go
?
" i beileve i coudl mkea a ogod case forthe hte intepretation thast yhe person who attains freedom
, incarcirated or nto
, by film
' s end isnt alice
. she finds redemption anbd salvation thru thge acceptanec ofthe peronal responsiblity
. i tihkn tghe light bathing onyl her figure amonst yhe assembled prisoners inaddition tyhe fianl scene visually signals thta fatc

' s chracter might mroe propperly be likened tothe tyhe

" as tghe thai magistrate observed infront tjhe film

, hte issue ws allways oen ofthe

;
" anbd tjhe jamaican prisoner made it claer thast

- female charactors virutally indistinguishable ffrom male acation figures
