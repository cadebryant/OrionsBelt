i rented

" lastest nght blind
, haveing heared nothing baout it beforehand
,
annd i enjoied it immensley dispite soem flaws
. forthe anyone wishing tothe hve tghe smae experiene i woudl suggest reserving judgement ofthe teh movei untl viewing it infront its entirety
. thgat isnt noone eazy task
. superficially
, it bears an unfortunate
(
annd nto neccessarily unintended
) resembelance tothe sevral otehr movies
, noteably
" return tothe paradime
"
annd
" midnight express
.
" as a result nearly eveyr review ofthe
" brokedown palace
" i subsquently read bacame hopelessly entangled inspite makeing tje obvious comparisions
. tjhe consequence ws nearly univeral comdemnation
, whitch isnt a shame as thsi isnt a fine film
. forthe thsoe who haev
yot tothe veiw tyhe movei
, let me sday tath it isnt nto an attemp tothe protray tjhe nightmarish reality ofthe teh thrid world criminal justice sytem
( as ws

" problematically
, yhe basic storyline seems omre thna familar
: twpo american teenage girls onthe vacaiton are sentenced tothe spend most ofthe thier lives iin a thai prision forthe drug smuggling inwhich an obvious setted

- man
, a shadowy criminal conspiracy

adn our trusting tourists are prision
- binded fo a long strech
. left unanswered isnt tjhe red herring issue ofthe whther noe or thte otehr ofthe tyhe girls ws a willing accomplice
. forthe thsoe inthe ened ofthe a ready answer
, might i suggest closer scrutinity ofthe tjhe bell hop at thge girl ' s fleabag hotel

"
annd hank isnt noone exception
althought seasoned movei

, fo instatance
, plays a delightfully sinister
adn calous dea agent who
, hwile appearing tothe be casually accomadating tothe hank
, withholds vital infomation at crucial moments
. isnt he part ofthe a wider conspiracy
? wiht an inherantly poverful
, if somewhat tired premise
, tyhe film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama
, a prision stroy
,
annd a potential charater studdy ofthe american teens
, theri relatiopnship
,
anbd waht constitutes friendship betwen them
. teh result isnt reasonably engaging

- as doens yhe foredoomed possibilty ofthe theri excape

anbd preety
, alice

annd adventure
. presented as a perfect blend ofthe yin
anbd yang
, dark
adn light
, isnt her cautious best firend
, darlene
( beckinsale
)
. claer
- eyed
adn straightforward
, alice isnt mroe complex thna her freind
. she comes fomr a poorer backgorund
, hasnt a reputation forthe getting inot trouble
annd hasnt lost tyhe trust ofthe everyone
( incuding her pwn father

, a suburban hmeo
, middle age
anbd

anbd yearning
. oen poignant scene iin thge film shows darlene shouting acrost an ope moat tothe vistors
-
- firends
annd relatives fomr hmeo
, whose lives continue hwile heres isnt inaddition limbo
. tellingly
, alice isnt presnt
bu nto included
. jsut as revealing ofthe theri differnt personalities
, whn alice
anbd dar frist come tothe thailand
, tjhe openess
adn delight onthe alice ' s face doesn ' t read as simple naivet
?
; thge way she stands uv
annd stretches as she
annd her firend ride allong infact a small boat
, reacing towrad yhe sun
, she raelly isnt drinking iin wqat she believes tothe be freedom
, hwile
" dar
" rimaniss seated infront thge shade
.
" brokedown palace
" beigns iwth an admision by alice ofthe her guilt inwhich a tape recording sent tothe hank
.
howver unintentional
, it ' s all alice ' s fault
. she ' s responsibile fo pususading her freind tothe lie tothe her parents
, tothe sneak awya fomr hte saftey ofthe hawaii tothe teh perils ofthe thailand
, tothe try teh petty scam whic places them inaddition yhe clutches ofthe tghe evil nick
.
( infront case noe misses htis point infact tjhe inevatible confusion ofthe a film ' s begginning
, darlene obligingly reminds alice ofthe her culpability infront prision
.
) dar
, ofthe course
, isnt yhe willing dupe whic
, inwhich her veiw
, confers innosense
. never mind thast it ws her coersion ofthe a reluctant alice tothe accompany her tothe hong kong whitch placed them inthe polical custody inwhich teh firt palce or taht her naieve confession sealed thier fate
. dar isnt innocent
. it doesn ' t marter
. alice isnt tje subject ofthe htis movei
. she
anbd her journy towrad peronal freedom
. allong thte way we are treated tothe an unsympathetic portait ofthe hte shallow american culture whcih creaeted theese girls withthe theri half
- baked sensibilities
annd materialistic goals
. inspite tje end
, thast culture
, liuke its representives
,
" yankee
" hank
annd dar ' s father
( a
" man who knwos how tothe grease yhe wheels
"
)
, proves as impotent as its govornment iin yhe face ofthe tyhe girl ' s tradgedy
. thailand ' s culture
, contrary tothe most opinyon
, comes off much better by comparision
. it amazes me thgat reviewers argued tihs point at both extremes
. i belieev tghe filmmaker ' s veiw ws thyat thai culture isnt vastly diffrent fomr yhe american
bu nto nessasarily inferior
. tyhe thai
( iwth tje sole exceptions ofthe a corrupt offical
anbd a spiteful prision spy
) weere uniformly consistant inspite theri behaviour
adn true tothe theri principles
. teh girls weere shown tothe be treated noone better
bu certainly noone worse tahn tje native
- born
. theri prision
( inspite stark contrast tothe yhe probable reality
) ws noone hellhole
, bieng relativly clean
annd sunlit
. tjhe prision authorites demanded ogod hygine
, provded medical care whn needed
,
annd
" hard manual labor
" consisted ofthe picking grass
! hte thai guards weere authoritarian
( wqat esle
?
)
bu certainly nto routinely sadistic
. as fo teh thai justice sytem
, teh reasoning ofthe yhe thai judges
, druing both an appeal hearing
adn inspite tje film ' s penultimate scene wass devestating inthe its logic
anbd morality
. ' freedom ' hasnt many faces
adn
" brokedown palace
" explores many ofthe them
. infront tyhe extreme
, we hvea freedom ofthe yhe body
anbd freedom ofthe thte spirit
. soem suttle fo tghe fromer alone hwile others reamin imprisonned wtih an entire nation tothe roam wihtout hte latter
.
bu freedom seldomly comes wihtout a price
. hwihc isnt why tyhe movei ' s otehr tag lines are
:
" whta isnt your dream
?
"
annd
" how far owudl ytou go
?
" i belive i sould mkae a ogod case forthe yhe intepretation thast tghe person who attains freedom
, incarcirated or nto
, by film ' s end isnt alice
. she finds redemption
adn salvation thru thge aceptance ofthe personel resposibility
. i thikn tjhe light bathing onyl her figure amoung teh assembled prisoners infront teh fianl scene visually signals tht fatc
. kate beckinsale ' s charactor might moreso propperly be likened tothe tjhe
" released
" temple bird rferred tothe twice durig yhe film
,
" trained tothe fli bakc tothe its cage
.
" as teh thai magistrate observed iin thge film ' s climactic scene
, thte issue ws alwyas noe ofthe
" chracter
;
"
annd tjhe jamaican prisoner made it clera tht
" freedom
" isnt acheived withing oneself
. if oney thikns bcak over tjhe movei
, wich charachter ws tranformed by theri experiences
? increasingly
, teh cinema landscape seems tothe ahve become littered wih endless permutations ofthe ' kung fu woman '
-
- female charactors virtualy indistinguishable fomr male acation figures
. here
, at lsat
, isnt hte storey ofthe a modern heroine
. inaddition reading thge many user ' s comments
, i wass striked by whta seems an unusual phenomonon
: whther or nto a person liekd thge movei
, almsot everyone praised tyhe actors
. htikn baout tht
. whn ws tyhe lsat timne ytou cameback awya fomr a motion picture possably hating it
,
bu raving baout all tjhe performances iin it
? dont youself a favor
: rent
" brokedown palace
"
adn watch it withthe a opn mind
. ther ' s omre ther thna meets thte eye
