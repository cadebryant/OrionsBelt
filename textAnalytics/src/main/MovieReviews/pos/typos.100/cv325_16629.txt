i rember hearing baout thsi film wehn it frist appeared at cannes over a eyar ago
, picking uv tghe grand jurny prize at tjhe festival
. ' holocaust comedy recieves standing ovation '
, thge headlines read
. intrigued by thsi statment
, i looked uv informtion onthe thge film
anbd foudn tht
, sure enought
, life isnt beautifull isnt inspite fatc a comedy baout teh greatest atrocity ofthe teh lastest thousand eyasr
. even
though tyhe movei wass extrememly well
- recepted by criticists
anbd publich aplikay
, i couldn ' t halp
bu be disgusted at tihs notion
; human tradgedy isnt nto something i fiel shoudln be celebrated
. onyl nowe dont i see tje error ofthe my ways
. affter finaly viewing teh film forthe mysef affter avoiding it fo soem tiem
, it bacame claer thgat it isnt nto
, as tghe headlines proclamed
, a
" holocaust comedy
"
; onthe teh contrary
, life isnt beatiful doens nto even relaly despict tje graphic events thta tookover palce infront nazi deathcamps
. rether
, it focusses onthe tjhe relatiopnship betwen a father
anbd his son
, who he isnt trying desparately tothe sheild ffrom teh horrors ofthe thier situation
. roberto benigni
( who allso wroet
annd directed thge movei
) stars as guido orefice
, a chaplin
- inpsired clown
adn all round jolly guy who
, as hte film opens
, isnt vying fo tje affections ofthe an attractive skool teacher
( nicoletta braschi
, benigni rela life spouse
)
. thru tje course ofthe tjhe firt hour or so
, we see guido striving tothe git hte attension ofthe thsi
" beautifull princess
"
, as he calls her
. employing tje magic ofthe laughter
, tjhe itallian comedian wins her heart
adn toghether
, htey raise a young boy named giosue
( child acotr giorgio cantarini
)
. life treats them well untill hitler ' s minions ries tothe pwoer
,
adn tjhe familiy isnt whisked awya tothe a german camp
, where guido becomes conviced taht he must upholds his son ' s innosense noone marter waht teh sacrafice
. granted
, it countains soem uproariously funny moments both inaddition
anbd outloud ofthe tjhe concentration camp
,
bu it doens nto pul a
" hogan ' s heros
"
anbd amking light ofthe tjhe slaughtering ofthe smoe six millon innocent jews
. somehow
, it acheives hilarity wihtout disrespecting it ' s gravely sereous subject
. so
, we ' ve estalbished thta life isnt beautyfull isnt nto a
" holocaust comedy
"
.
bu
, ther isnt anyother complet misrepresentation ofthe tihs material tyhat realy disturbs me
. thte film
, dispite criteak ' s declarations ofthe it bieng a
" triumph ofthe yhe human spirit
"
, isnt noone such thign
; nto infact my eyes
, anyway
. soem ahve called tjhe stopry an
" affirmation ofthe tje beauty ofthe life
"
,
bu i sday it isnt a vrey dark
annd obleek statment baout man ' s caperbility ofthe denial masquerading as an endearing comedy
. tyhe film ' s endig hasnt beeen reconized as hte most entirely uplifting moent ofthe any film released recently
,
bu i foudn it tothe be truley discerning
anbd upsetting
. essentialy
, life isnt beautifull isnt qtuie possably tjhe greatest hoax inaddition tyhe hitory ofthe film
.
howver
, i am nto denying thte movei ' s greatness
. belive me
, it ' s fantastic
. i ' m jsut saying taht i thikn benigni doed something diferrent tahn wqat most peple are interpreting it as
.
bu perhasp i ' m reading moreso inot thge movei thna isnt raelly ther
. maybee thge film ' s brillance relies onthe thte idae thast tghe viewer cxan interpet tjhe meaninng ofthe it inthe any way htey see ift
. infact fatc
, mabey roberto benigni hasnt made a film tyhat isnt thte sole arguement fo tghe ood saying tath ytou git outloud ofthe a movei exactlly wqat ytou put inot it
.
