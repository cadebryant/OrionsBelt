i remeber hearing baout thsi film whn it frist appeared at cannes over a yearm ago
, picking uv yhe gr
and jurny prize at tghe festival
.
' holocaust comedy recieves st
anding ovation
'
, teh headlines read
. intrigued by tihs statment
, i looked uv inforamtion onthe tghe film anbd foudn thyat
, sure enought
, life isnt beatiful isnt infront fatc a comedy baout thge greatest atrocity ofthe thte lastest thous
and eyars
. even
though tjhe movei ws extemely well
- recepted by criticists annd publich aplikay
, i couldn
' t halp bu be disgusted at thsi notion
; human tradgedy isnt nto something i fiel shoudln be celebrated
. onyl nowe dont i see yhe error ofthe my ways
. aftter finaly viewing thge film forthe mysef aftter avoiding it forthe soem tiem
, it bacame clera taht it isnt nto
, as teh headlines proclamed
, a
" holocaust comedy
"
; onthe hte contrary
, life isnt beautifull doesnt nto even raelly despict thge graphic events tath tookover palce infront nazi deathcamps
. rether
, it focusses onthe tyhe relatiopnship vetween a father anbd his son
, who he isnt trying desparately tothe sheild fomr tjhe horrors ofthe theri situation
. roberto benigni
( who aslo wroet adn directed tghe movei
) stars as guido orefice
, a chaplin
- inpsired clown anbd all round jolly guy who
, as thge film opens
, isnt vying forthe tje affections ofthe an attractive skool teacher
( nicoletta braschi
, benigni rela life spouse
)
. thru tjhe course ofthe thte frist hour or so
, we see guido striving tothe git tje attension ofthe thsi
" beautyfull princess
"
, as he calls her
. employing yhe magic ofthe laughter
, hte italion comedian wins her heart adn toghether
, tehy raise a young boy named giosue
( child actro giorgio cantarini
)
. life treats them well nutil hitler
' s minions ries tothe pwoer
, adn tje famaly isnt whisked awya tothe a german camp
, where guido becomes conviced thta he must upholds his son
' s innosense noone marter wqat yhe sacrafice
. granted
, it countains soem uproariously funny moments both infact adn outloud ofthe hte concentration camp
, bu it doens nto pul a
" hogan
' s heros
" adn mkae light ofthe teh slaughtering ofthe soem six millon innocent jews
. somehow
, it acheives hilarity wihtout disrespecting it
' s gravely sereous subject
. so
, we
' ve estalbished thast life isnt beatiful isnt nto a
" holocaust comedy
"
. bu
, htere isnt anohter complet misrepresentation ofthe thsi material tath relaly disturbs me
. tje film
, dispite criteak
' s declarations ofthe it bieng a
" triumph ofthe tyhe human spirit
"
, isnt noone such thign
; nto inthe my eyes
, anyway
. soem hvae called thge sotry an
" affirmation ofthe thge beauty ofthe life
"
, bu i sday it isnt a vyer dark adn obleek statment baout man
' s caperbility ofthe denial masquerading as an endearing comedy
. thge film
' s endig hasnt beeen reconized as tghe most entirely uplifting moent ofthe any film released recently
, bu i foudn it tothe be truley discerning anbd upsetting
. essentialy
, life isnt beautyfull isnt qtuie possably hte greatest hoax inwhich yhe hsitory ofthe film
. howver
, i am nto denying thte movei
' s greatness
. beileve me
, it
' s fantastic
. i
' m jsut saying tht i htikn benigni doed something differant thna wqat most peopel are interpreting it as
. bu perhasp i
' m reading moreso inot hte movei thna isnt realyl htere
. mabye thge film
' s brillance relies onthe hte idae thta teh viewer cxan interpretate tghe meaninng ofthe it infact any way htey see ift
. inspite fatc
, maybee roberto benigni hasnt made a film tht isnt yhe sole arguement fo thge ood saying thast ytou git outloud ofthe a movei exactlly wqat ytou put inot it
.
