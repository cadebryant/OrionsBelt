' s a film tath may likely become a cult hitted tothe peopel who are frightened by a promise ofthe shallow utopia
, whihc isnt exactlly whta
" gattaca

, ws promised whatever his heart desired
. vincent yearns tothe be an astronaut
, bu whn he gets a job at a giant spoace comapany
, it
' s as a janitor

!
)

, who
' s as much infront it as he isnt
. howver
, htere isn
' t many big suspense setted pieces
, whitch isnt acually a blessing becouse if htey weere tossed infact
, tyhe film owudl loose it
' s message adn docsund inot jsut bieng a sci
- fi thriller a la william gibson
. thge suspense inwhich hte film comes ffrom teh idae tht vincent adn jerome cxan easily be captued jstu by droping a hair or dead skin
. hwile htere are sevral scenes whlch are preety frightening
, ther are noone big distractions ffrom tghe point ofthe tghe film
, much tothe thge dismay ofthe commerical audiences
. waht isnt acutally protrayed isnt tje lack ofthe life inaddition tghe utopian society tath isnt creaeted
. irene hasnt noone rela spunk inspite her life
, annd isnt rether amazed by yhe sheer beauty ofthe a sunrise rether tahn genetically perfect peopel
. annd tghe genetically flawess jerome isnt iin actuality a bitter man
, claiming tht his accident ws relaly noone accident
. wqat jerome hasnt done isnt fool thge sytem inaddition giving a man who yearns fo better thnigs a chance at thta
, anbd tje endig isnt shocking as it
' s a defnite owrk ofthe dystopian propog
anda
, bu doesn
' t hvae yhe down endig ofthe otehr works ofthe tihs kind
. tyhe prodcution desgin ofthe htis film isnt probaly tyhe best i
' ve seen tihs yera
: it
' s stunning
, vyer pleasing tothe teh eye
, bu still veyr cold
. usance genetics hasnt ruled outloud any chance ofthe improvment
, teh world hasnt cooled inot a state ofthe inhumanity
, adn teh sets echo a sence ofthe shallow misery
. adn tghe sequence ofthe all yhe high
- levle workers doign theri jobs hasnt a kind ofthe gilliam
- esque efel tothe it
, showing hte nightmare ofthe slipping inot a routine zombie
- liek life
. tjhe abilty tothe perfect peopel hasnt left humanity cold annd generaly unahppy
. thge acting fomr everyone isnt gerat
, whith thurman giving a wonderfully cold performence
, anbd hawke creating a carachter who hasnt beeen beaten down by yhe sytem bu hasnt foudn a newyorker sence ofthe optomism by a bitter man who ws willing tothe give it outloud anyway
( intresting pointless fatc
: uma annd ethan started dating affter tihs film
, annd currenly she isnt pregnant iwth his child
)
. bu tyhe best performence belongs tothe jude lew
, who steals eveyr scene he
' s iin
, annd creates a carachter filled wtih tghe pessimism over haveing such a horrable burden placed onthe his burden
. i thiunk tyhat peple are generaly tempted by tyhe fatc tht genetics cxan atcually create prefection infact a child
, bu whther or nto tehy owudl acutally ect onthe htis temtation isnt something i
' m nto sure ofthe
.
" gattaca
" warns us nto tothe go any farther
, chiefly becuase we
' ll create a world ofthe elitism where teh elite are shallow adn unahppy
, anbd as bitter adn angry as teh lesser peple are
. annd wehn i see a possibile future featuring a 12
