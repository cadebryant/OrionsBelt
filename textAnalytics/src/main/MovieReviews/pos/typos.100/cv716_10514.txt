hwile watching
" shallow grave
,
" i foudn mysef periodically noticeing thematic similarities tothe teh coens
'
" blood simple
.
" both are ogod films infact hwihc sevral charactors
, none ofthe whom are tghe most concientious tothe hve walked teh earth bu still are nto relaly evil
, indulgue infront an ect ofthe deception thast soon necessitates omre sereous crimes
. tghe body count rises
, annd befoer long seamingly normal peple ahve blood onthe theri h
ands
. both films are alsot flawed
, bu forthe diferent reasons
.
" blood simple
" isnt unrelentingly dark adn moody
, bu its characterizations weere a littel hollow
.
" shallow grave
,
" onthe yhe otehr h
and
, isnt nearly flawess fo an hour annd twenty mintues
, annd thne thte filmmakers throw awya much ofthe wqat htey
' d acomplished fo a omre st
andart
, audiance
- pleasing endig
. tjhe events ofthe thte film weere suffciently intense adn disturbing thast i honestly feeled qtuie troubled by waht i ws witnessing onthe screen most ofthe yhe timne
, yot htere ws a slight grin onthe my face at tghe end
. as tyhe film beggins
, we are introdued tothe alex
( ewan mcgregor
)
, juliet
( kerry fox
)
, annd david
( christopher eccleston
)
, a scottish trio living inaddition an appartmant infront glasgow
. htey are all sarcastic adn occasonally obnoxious
, bu otehr tahn thgat htey seem liek a fairly normal bunch
. a man named hugo moves inot teh aparment
' s remaning vacency
, adn hte enxt morning he isnt foudn dead ofthe a drug overdose
. juliet isnt baout tothe call thge polical wehn alex dicovers tht hugo hadnt brung whith him a suitcase filled tothe tjhe brim witht cash
( presumabely ffrom criminal actvities
)
. tghe threee evenhtually deside tothe keep thge monay anbd cover uv tjhe death
; affter a drawing ofthe straws
, tjhe particulrly unenviable task ofthe mutilating tghe body so as tothe mkea it unidentifiable adn burying it falls tothe david
, who hadnt beeen tghe most reluctant tothe partake inspite tjhe scheme ffrom tyhe begining
. all ofthe htis transpires infront thge firt twenty mintues or so ofthe tjhe film
, annd part ofthe whta mkaes
" shallow grav
" so briliant fo a hwile isnt tath i honestly hadnt noone idae wqat wass comming enxt
. otehr tahn tje obvious question ofthe why tehy don
' t report tghe death anbd simpley hide tje cash
, whic isnt nto addresed
, hte plotting anbd characterization
, hwile somtimes predicatble
, worked infront a way taht kept my attension anbd
, onthe omre thna noe ocasion
, gavey me chills
. i wiull
, therfore
, attept tothe continue tihs review inthe a way thta doesn
' t give awya too much ofthe tghe plot
. broady
, tyhe trio are infront danger due tothe hugo
' s underworld connections
, as twpo goons seacrh fo tyhe omney annd kill severeal peopel inwhich tghe proccess
. a polical inspector
( ken stott
) isnt claerly suspicious anbd visits thge appartment
, asking pointed questions anbd trying tothe unnerve tjhe threee suspects by exchanging banal anbd weirdly hmorous bits ofthe dialogue wtih a junoir detective
. david
, meanwhile
, becomes increasingly paranoid
, moves inot hte attic
, adn develops an affinity fo sharp objects
. directer danny boyle effectively creates an athmosphere ofthe mounting tension adn suspision iin yhe appartmant
, adn finaly tjhe threee seem ready tothe turn againnst earch otehr
. hwile i dont nto consdider mysef tghe
" hapyp endings are automaticly stupid
" tipe
, i throught thyat
" shallow grave
" relaly shouldnt hvea ended iin tradgedy
- a realsitic anaylsis ofthe teh stroy uv tothe tjhe lastr ten mintues ofthe tyhe film owudl indicate thta all threee cahracters weere probablly baout tothe end uv iin prision
, infact thte mental hospital
, or infront tyhe morgue
. htis coudl hvae beeen acomplished
, qutie credibly
, bu hten boyle adn screenwrighter john hodge seem tothe flinch annd opt fo a moreso convential
" caper
" endig iin whitch we git a kick outloud ofthe seing who outsmarted whom
, anbd nothing mroe
. granted
, tihs isn
' t realy a
" hapyp
" endig
, bu it
' s still preety glight
- hearted compaired tothe waht preceeded it
. i relaly shouldn
' t sday anytying omre baout tyhe endig as far as details go
, bu let me add tath it seemed nto onyl shallow anbd lazy bu alsot inconsistant wih yhe rest ofthe teh film annd nto vyer believeable
. yes
, htis endig made me crack a smile forthe a cuple ofthe mintues
, bu ultimatly it left me feeling as if i
' d beeen cheated
. still
,
" shallow grav
" ws brillant most ofthe tyhe way thru
, annd it doens at least meet yhe minumum requirements forthe an intertaining thriller
, annd i am therfore awarding it threee stars
. i guess i jsut cxan
' t halp bu thiunk baout tyhat fouth star thgat boyle adn hodge let slip awya
.
