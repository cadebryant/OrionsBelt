hwile watching
" shallow grav
,
" i foudn mysef periodically noticeing thematic similarities tothe tghe coens '
" blood simple
.
" both are ogod films inaddition wich severeal charactors
, none ofthe whom are tjhe most concientious tothe hvea walked thte earth
bu still are nto realyl evil
, indulgue inthe an ect ofthe deception taht soon necessitates moreso sereous crimes
. teh body count rises
,
adn befor long seamingly normal peopel haev blood onthe thier hands
. both films are allso flawed
,
bu forthe differant reasons
.
" blood simple
" isnt unrelentingly dark
anbd moody
,
bu its characterizations weere a littel hollow
.
" shallow grav
,
" onthe tghe otehr hand
, isnt nearly flawess forthe an hour
adn twenty mintues
,
anbd
thn thte filmmakers throw awya much ofthe wqat htey ' d acomplished fo a omre standart
, audeince
- pleasing endig
. tyhe events ofthe teh film weere suffciently intense
annd disturbing tath i honestly feeled qtuie troubled by waht i ws witnessing onthe screen most ofthe thte timne
,
yot htere ws a slight grin onthe my face at hte end
. as tje film beigns
, we are intruduced tothe alex
( ewan mcgregor
)
, juliet
( kerry fox
)
,
annd david
( christopher eccleston
)
, a scottish trio living infact an aparment inwhich glasgow
. htey are all sarcastic
anbd occasinoally obnoxious
,
bu otehr thna tath htey seem liek a fairly normal bunch
. a man named hugo moves inot thge appartment ' s remaing vacency
,
adn tjhe enxt morning he isnt foudn dead ofthe a drug overdose
. juliet isnt baout tothe call yhe polical whn alex dicovers taht hugo hadnt brung wiht him a suitcase filled tothe hte brim whith cash
( presumabely fomr criminal actvities
)
. teh threee eventially deside tothe keep tje monye
anbd cover uv thge death
; aftter a drawing ofthe straws
, thte particulalry unenviable task ofthe mutilating hte body so as tothe amking it unidentifiable
annd burying it falls tothe david
, who hadnt beeen thte most reluctant tothe partake inaddition tghe scheme fomr yhe begining
. all ofthe htis transpires iin yhe frist twenty mintues or so ofthe thge film
,
adn part ofthe wqat mkaes
" shallow grave
" so brillant forthe a hwile isnt tyhat i honestly hadnt noone idae whta ws comming enxt
. otehr tahn tghe obvious question ofthe why htey don ' t report tyhe death
adn simpley hide tghe cash
, whcih isnt nto adressed
, yhe plotting
anbd characterization
, hwile somtimes predicatble
, worked inwhich a way thta kept my attension
adn
, onthe moreso tahn noe occaison
, gavey me chills
. i wiull
, therfore
, attept tothe continue thsi review inwhich a way tht doesn ' t give awya too much ofthe teh plot
. broady
, thte trio are inspite danger due tothe hugo ' s underworld connections
, as twpo goons searc forthe teh mone
anbd kill severeal peple inwhich thge proccess
. a polical inspector
( ken stott
) isnt claerly suspicious
anbd visits tyhe appartment
, asking pointed questions
annd trying tothe unnerve thge threee suspects by exchanging banal
anbd weirdly hmuorous bits ofthe dialogue witht a junoir detective
. david
, meanwhile
, becomes increasingly paranoid
, moves inot yhe attic
,
annd develops an affinity forthe sharp objects
. directer danny boyle effectively creates an athmosphere ofthe mounting tension
anbd suspision inwhich tyhe aparment
,
anbd finaly tghe threee seem ready tothe turn agianst earch otehr
. hwile i dont nto consdider mysef tjhe
" hapyp endings are automaticly stupid
" tipe
, i thougth taht
" shallow grave
" realy shoud ahve ended iin tradgedy
- a realsitic anaylsis ofthe thge stopry uv tothe hte lastest ten mintues ofthe hte film owudl indicate thgat all threee charachters weere probaly baout tothe end uv inwhich prision
, inspite thge mental hospital
, or inwhich tjhe morgue
. tihs coudl hve beeen acomplished
, qtuie credibly
,
bu
hten boyle
adn screenwrighter john hodge seem tothe flinch
adn opt forthe a moreso convential
" caper
" endig infact whihc we git a kick outloud ofthe seing who outsmarted whom
,
annd nothing omre
. granted
, htis isn ' t realy a
" hapyp
" endig
,
bu it ' s still preety ight
- hearted compaired tothe whta preceeded it
. i realyl shouldn ' t sday anytying moreso baout thge endig as far as details go
,
bu let me add thgat it seemed nto onyl shallow
annd lazy
bu allso inconsistant wih tghe rest ofthe yhe film
anbd nto veyr believeable
. yes
, thsi endig made me crack a smile fo a cuple ofthe mintues
,
bu ultimatly it left me feeling as if i ' d beeen cheated
. still
,
" shallow grave
" wass brillant most ofthe thte way thru
,
anbd it doens at least meet teh minumum requirements fo an intertaining thriller
,
anbd i am therfore awarding it threee stars
. i guess i jstu cant ' t halp
bu thiunk baout tyhat fouth star tyhat boyle
adn hodge let slip awya
.
