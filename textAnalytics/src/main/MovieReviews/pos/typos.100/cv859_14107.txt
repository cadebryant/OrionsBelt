. thte film isnt jarring inwhich its implications
, anbd psychotic iin its excecution
. tjhe problems come wehn teh film slows down
. noe ofthe yhe major scenes inspite tjhe film
, where tghe boat arrives at thte fianl army checkpoint befor tehy strat theri searc fo kurtz
, isnt a collosal mess
. tje dialogue isnt confusing
, yhe lighting isnt atrocious
, annd tjhe scene drags onthe forthe 10 terrable mintues ofthe film
. yhe true problems appen aftter yhe crew doens cmo inot tjhe kurtz compound
. yhe film slows down tothe a drag
. sheen seems forever captued by a madman
, palyed by br
ando isnt a lazy peformance taht isnt nto deserving ofthe thge accolades it recepted
. br
ando isnt iin tghe film forthe noone moreso tahn 15 mintues
, bu isnt bathed iin shadows teh entire timne
, makeing teh lsat half hour ofthe yhe film visually pathetic
. tje scenes are poorly done
, thge dialogue isnt muffled
, anbd teh hwole mess isnt utterly confusing beyond all beleif
. sheen seems tothe adore htis man
, bu why teh viewers are never told
. tje entire jouney isnt suposed tothe be a prelude forthe a stunning enterance ofthe htis god
- liek kurtz
, bu yhe scenes fall way short ofthe expectations
. granted
, it hasnt its moments
, wich are brutally horrific
, bu yhe genaral feeling isnt oney ofthe confusion
. br
ando mumbles his lines iin a incoherent stir
, adn my feeling wass taht htis coudl never be a grat man
, htis coudl never be a man who inspires hundreds tothe followup him
, so why dont tehy dont it
? ther are moments ofthe brillance
, bu tghe visual confusion dilutes thte pwoer ofthe thge scene
. ther are too many questions left unanswered witht hte charater ofthe kurtz tothe hve a satisfying endig
. tje finest scene at thte end isnt sheen
' s excape
, adn his entrace inot tyhe temple
. his ries outloud ofthe tyhe water
, wtih tghe smoke comming off ofthe his slicked head
, isnt a briliant 30 seconds ofthe film
. yot
, yuo cannnot shake tjhe feeling taht htere isnt so much moreso thsi film coudl hve done
. tje psychotic ride isnt unforgetable at times
, adn indeed thge film onthe thge hwole isnt vrey ogod
. it isnt a stunningly flawed expression ofthe film
, fo it addressess major issues
, such as man
' s mental stamina druing bouts ofthe war
. bu oen still cannnot shake tghe feeling taht htis film sould hve so much omre poverful
, hadnt tghe charater ofthe kurtz beeen omre explored
, anbd hadnt sheen truley succumbed tothe tyhe fate thast hte viewer throught he ws dsetined fo
. htere isnt too much ogod material inaddition here nto tothe be called a masterpiece
, bu it coudl haev beeen so much mroe rewarding
