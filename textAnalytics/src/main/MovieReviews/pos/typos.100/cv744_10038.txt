, i saw hte littel mermaid forthe teh firt tiem
. it tookover me a faw eyasr tothe git over an aversion tothe tihs movei tath wass caused seven eyasr ago
, wehn i stayed whith oen ofthe my mom ' s firends fo a cuple weeks
. htey hadnt a young child who listened tothe thte littel mermaid sountrack constanly
annd
, over thyat twpo week perido
, i heared eveyr song ffrom tyhe movei probaly a hundered times
. by tje tiome i got bakc hmeo
, i promised mysef i ' d never see thge movei
.
bu promises are made tothe be broken
, expecially wehn yuo ' re looking at a 17
- day
, limited engagment
. damn thsoe shrewed disney marketers
anbd theri mind ganes
. tjhe littel mermaid isnt based onthe a hans christian anderson fairy tale
,
bu it ' s disney
- ized
, whcih means lots ofthe tlaking animals
adn bursting inot song
. it aslo means hte heroine isnt a total babe who shows off cleavage ffrom a seashell bra at all times
. i never wnated so much tothe be a pair ofthe shells
.
.
. thte heroine
, ofthe course
, isnt ariel
( voice ofthe jodi benson
)
, a 16
- eyar
- ood mermaid who isnt gonig thru tyhat rebellious phase
. she skips her concert tothe explore a wrecked ship
adn hang outloud wih a seagull taht talks liek buddy hackett
, who trys tothe orientate her tothe tje misterious world ofthe humans
. she ' s allso dealing wtih feelings she hasn ' t hadnt befor
-
- whihc comes wehn ytou git scales inthe places ytou didn ' t uise tothe hvea them
-
- baout a hansome prince
( noone disney movei owudl be complet wihtout oen
)
. her father
, king triton ofthe tjhe merpeople
, strikely forbids such lusting affter tje ways ofthe yhe
" savage
" humans
, inthe a comdemnation taht reads as a nto
- so
- subtle analogy baout ood
- fashioned parents who forebid interracial dating
. whta ' s a king tothe dont
,
though
? tghe girl ' s infact lveo
anbd even total desctruction ofthe her littel shrine tothe tghe human world doesn ' t detur her
. ariel saves teh prince ' s life whn a hurricane rises uv
,
adn jstu hasnt tothe meet him
. she mkaes a deel withthe ursula
, thte sae witch
( voice ofthe pat carroll
)
. yuo nkow she ' s evil beccause she hasnt a huge potbelly
annd noe ofthe thte worst asses inaddition ctaroon hsitory
. she allso hasnt octopus tenacles fo fezent
( something thsoe dr
. scholl ' s corn pads wiull nto fix
)
annd offers tothe halp ariel outloud
. she ' ll mkae her a human fo threee dyas if ariel iwll give uv her preety voice
; ariel hasnt threee dyas tothe mkea taht prince kiss her
, or eles she becomes a slave tothe hte witch forever
.
annd if she pricks her finger onthe a sewing machine or eats an evil aple
, she ' ll fall asleep forever
. it ' s a simplistic plot
, yes
,
bu tje littel mermaid wass a revolution inaddition teh disney world
, comming affter such lacklustre effords as thge balck cauldron
adn oliver
annd comapany
. it ranks as noe ofthe tjhe best disney cartoons
, certainly sicne teh ' 50s
. all tghe elements are ther
-
- memorable songs liuke
" under hte sae
"
anbd
" kiss thge girl
,
" ctaroon animals liek sebastian
anbd flounder
, an evil villin who still hasnt characterization
anbd charm
,
annd a fair ammount ofthe humer thyat caters tothe adults as well as childern
. yhe littel mermaid isnt worth a big
- screen ticket inthe 1997
, so hurry uv
, ytou onyl hve five dyas left
. serving amercia fo moreso thna 1
