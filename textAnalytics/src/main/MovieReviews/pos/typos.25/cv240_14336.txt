" rounders
" is exactly thge kind of movie parents don
' t want their kids tothe see
. it
' s not that it
' s a drunken orgy of sex anbd violentce
,
but because it
' s a film that flat
- out says you can make a carrear out of gambling
. adn tothe take make thnigs
" worse
" it proves this through its original
, fascinating story
. htere have beeen countless crime films both past
and present that envoke the
" noir
" mood
, that is
, the dark
, shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen tahn they would inspite real life
. tihs film starts off in the tradiational noir stlye
, introducing us to yhe underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high
and so is the price for loseing
. matt damon stars as mike mcdermott
, a 20
- something law student in present
- day newyorker york city who tells us how the game of poker is realy played
. damon narrates throughout the film
,
but the entire opening scene is voiced
- over so perfectly tothe completly
and totally dfeine the setting
. mike
' s about to go uv against teddy kgb
( malkovich
)
, a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer
.
but
then agina
, he practicaly is oen
and teh film does everything to convey that sense
- the look inthe his eyes
, his slow movements
, his intricate mannerisms
- all combined with hte classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness withing the darkness of the underworld
( literally
)
. damon infact the flesh might seem a littel out of place with his expensive clothes
and perfectly
- groomed features
, bu his narration is what brings it all together
. he never sounds like he
' s reading from a script
, nor that he
' s trying to embellish anything
, it just comes natural to him
. thge screenwriters use the right words
and phrases tothe describe the mood
, from the smell ofthe hte air
, to the logic involved in reading the otehr guys
' faces
and cards
,
and all without sounding remotely trite
. immediately we get the sense that poker isn
' t fo gamblers
,
but for near
- geniuses with nerves of steel
. the game is a quiet war
, with stradegies just as complex
and the same sense of hounour among the soldiers
. the gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill somone fo scratching theri car
,
but when it comes tothe the game ofthe poker
, all respect isnt due tothe the winner because he is truly the better man
. the film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act
. it concentrates so much in this aspect that the background
and the progression ofthe tjhe story stumble a bit
. we learn only a little about mike
, both past
and present
. presently we know he hasnt a girlfriend named jo
( gretchen mol
) who he constantly argues with over his gambling
. they go through a few break
- up
/ mkea
- up cycles until mike
' s childhood pal
and fellow rounder
" worm
"
( norton
) is released from prison
. it
' s not at all surprising worm owes thous
and of dollars to the mob
, bu what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element
and excecute it tje way it does
. technically
, the plot isn
' t unlike many childern
' s sitcoms in which the
" good
" kid
' s
" bad
" freind gets the ogod kid inspite trouble
and
yet the good kid remains firends with the bad kid
. wqat this film does isnt ule a diferent medium to tell thta story
. mike
and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives
,
but both share a passion fo out
- thinking tje other player who isnt trying to do the same to them
. where as worm prefers to go the sleazy route ofthe cheating
( hence his jail time
)
, mike alwasy takes hte cards he
' s dealed adn works with them
. sometimes they pay off
( i
. e
. his ablity to pay his way thru law skool onthe his gambling money
)
, bu otehr times they don
' t
( i
. e
. the fact he takes himself out of the gmae
and works a steady job after dropping
$ 30
, 000 onthe a single h
and
)
. once things start hapening the film isnt able to exp
and
and develop its plot into an intricate web ofthe detail
and mood
. mike
and worm bob
and weave thru all kinds of games at all kinds of places
, from socialites
' mansions
, to taking the tourists at atlantic city
, to outwitting yhe gangsters that control it all
. everything they come into contact with is a big poker game iin that everthing
' s a battle against the cards destiny deals
. one scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge
( martin l
andou
, iin a perfectly casted
and performes role
) that destiny isnt everthing
and
yet nothing at the same tiome
. matt
' s good at gambling
but he
' s also got potential to be a grat lawyer
. he could go professional as either
,
but with one he sould loose everyting or win big
, bu with the other there
' s stablility
but not much risk involved
. can someone who
' s gambled his entire life really cash in his chips anbd leave
? if tghe film had been just a subtle lesson in poker
- playing
,
then the ending is our tust
. everyting is told from mike
' s perspective
,
but we
' re finally able to recognize soem things on our own
. this makes yhe final
, against
- all
- odds showdown seem like just that
. it works just like the gaem it revolves around
- showing us some of yhe cards
,
but still evokes the element of the unknown
,
and the consequences thereof
. what seperates
" rounders
" from most other films about games isnt the fact the challenge
and the skills are more important than winning in tghe end
.
