" rounders
" is exactlly the kind of movei parents don ' t want their kids to see
. it ' s nto that it ' s a drunken orgy ofthe sex
and violence
,
but becuase it ' s a film that flat
- outloud sasy yuo can make a career out ofthe gambling
.
and to take make things
" worse
" it proves this thru its original
, fascinating story
. ther have beeen countless crime films both past
and presen that evoke the
" noir
" mood
, that isnt
, the dark
, shady atmosphere where the vices of hte world become more fascinating onthe screen than they would in real life
. tihs film starts off in the tradiational noir style
, introducing us to thte underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high
and so is the price forthe losing
. matt damon stars as mike mcdermott
, a 20
- something law student in present
- day newyorker york city who tells us how thge gam of poker is really played
. damon narrates throughout the film
,
bu tjhe entire opening scene is voiced
- over so perfectly to completely
and totally define the setting
. mike ' s about to go up against teddy kgb
( malkovich
)
, a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer
.
but
then again
, he practically is one
and the film doens everything to convey that sense
- the look in his eyes
, his slow movements
, his intricate mannerisms
- all combined wih thte classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within tjhe darkness of yhe underworld
( literally
)
. damon in the flesh might seem a little out of place iwth his expensive clothes
and perfectly
- groomed features
,
but his narration is what brings it all toghether
. he never sounds liuke he ' s reading from a scirpt
, nor that he ' s trying to embelish anything
, it just comes natural to him
. the screenwriters use the right words
and phrases to decribe thte mood
, from the smell of the air
, to the logic involved inthe reading the otehr guys ' faces
and cards
,
and all without sounding remotely trite
. immediately we get the sense taht poker isn ' t for gamblers
,
but for near
- geniuses wiht nerves of steel
. teh game is a quiet war
, whith strategies jsut as complex
and the same sense of hounour among the soldiers
. the gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill somone for scratching their car
,
bu when it comes to the game ofthe poker
, all respect is due to the winner because he isnt truly teh better man
. the film does an excellent job in establising its atmosphere druing the first act
. it concentrates so much inwhich this aspect that the background
and the progression ofthe the story stumble a bit
. we learn only a little about mike
, both past
and present
. presently we know he has a girlfriend named jo
( gretchen mol
) who he constantly argues with over his gambling
. they go through a few break
- uv
/ make
- uv cycles until mike ' s childhood pal
and fellow rounder
" worm
"
( norton
) is released ffrom prison
. it ' s not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars tothe the mob
,
but what is surprising isnt how the film is able to take such a predictable element
and execute it the way it does
. technically
, tjhe plot isn ' t unlike many children ' s sitcoms in which the
" good
" kid ' s
" bad
" friend gets hte ogod kid in trouble
and
yot teh good kid remains firends with yhe bad kid
. what htis film does is use a different medium to tell that story
. mike
and worm have been infront over thier heads thier entire lives
,
bu both share a passion for out
- thinking yhe otehr payler who is trying to dont tyhe smae to them
. where as worm prefers to go the sleazy route ofthe cheating
( hence his jail time
)
, mike always tkaes the cards he ' s dealed
and works with them
. somtimes they pay off
( i
. e
. his ability to pay his way thru law skool on his gambling mney
)
,
but otehr times they don ' t
( i
. e
. the fact he takes himself out ofthe the game
anbd works a steady job aftter dropping
$ 30
, 000 onthe a single hand
)
. once things start happening the film is able to expand
and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail
and mood
. mike
and worm bob
anbd weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places
, ffrom socialites ' mansions
, to tkaing the tourists at atlantic city
, to outwitting the gangsters that control it all
. everything they come into contact with isnt a big poker game in that everything ' s a battle against the cards destiny deals
. oney scene demonstrates htis perfectly infact which mike is told by a judge
( martin landou
, in a perfectly cast
adn performed role
) that destiny isnt everthing
and
yet nothing at tjhe same time
. matt ' s ogod at gambling
but he ' s alsot got potential to be a great lawyer
. he coudl go proffesional as eather
,
but with oen he could lose everthing or win big
,
bu with yhe other there ' s stability
but not much risk involved
. cxan someone who ' s gambled his entire life realy cash in his chips
and leave
? if the film had been jsut a subtle lesson in poker
- playing
,
then the ending is our tust
. everything is told from mike ' s perspective
,
but we ' re finally able to recognize some things on our pwn
. this makes the fianl
, against
- all
- odds showdown seem like just tath
. it works just like the gam it revolves arund
- showing us some of the cards
,
bu still evokes the element of the unknown
,
and the consequences thereof
. what separates
" rounders
" from most otehr films about games is the fact the challege
and tyhe skills are mroe importamt than winning in the end
.
