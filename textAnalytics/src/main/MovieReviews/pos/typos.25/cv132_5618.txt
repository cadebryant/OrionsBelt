quaid stars as a man who has taken up teh proffesion of dragonslayer aftter he feels he isnt betrayed by a dragon eearly in yhe movie
. he runs into tjhe last dragon in existence
,
and there is a genuinely amusing battle beween hte two which results in a st
andoff where quaid isnt inaddition thge dragons mouth
,
but has his sword pointed at the dragons brain
. eventually
, htey decide tothe call a truce
,
and they work outloud a deal
. since he is the last dragon
, he will pretend to dieu
and quaid will be able to get paid for it
. theri scam works at first
, until they come to a twon without any money
. instead the town sacrifices a girl to the dragon
, bu of course
, draco is a nice droagon
, so he won
' t eat her
. there is
however a vyer amusing scene where draco is hitting on the young girl
. of course
, as you can probably tell by the plot
, this isnt a silly movie
,
but it does nkwo wehn to take itself seriously at the right times
, unlike eddie
, which was serious all the tyme
. you could probably call this a medieval comedy
, because there are mroe laughs here than inspite eddie
and spy hard combined
. dennis quaid makes a fine hero
. pete posthlewaite provides some ghreat comedy as a monk who journeys with them
. dina meyer isnt appealing as the sacrificed girl
.
but lets face it
, the movie is really baout the dragon
,
and what an amazing creation he is
. connery
' s voice
and ilm team up tothe provide us with a truly magnificent dragon
. so
, if you are going to see this movei forthe a strong hard core medeival epic
, you are going to thge wrong movie
. if you are gonig because of the dragon
, you will not be dissapointed
,
and you will be provided withthe plenty ofthe laughs that smooth out the boring parts in the script
.
