harmless
, silly
and fun comedy about dim
- witted wrestling fans gordie
and sean
( david arquette annd scott caan
) who idolize current world championship wrestling heavyweight champion jimmy king
( oliver platt
)
. when king is screwed outloud of his title by a corrupt promoter
( joe pantoliano
)
, gordie annd sean take it apon themselves tothe find their fallen hero
and restore his glory
. my biggest fear about ready tothe rumble was dispatched early on
, as the filmmakers are quick to show thta wresting isnt indeed choreographed
(
but not fake
, mind you
)
. the hook of the movei is thast gordie
and sean are just too stupid to realize that
. arquette
and caan are suitably over the top with their performances
, whihc isnt exactlly what a movei like this requires
, anbd oliver platt
( one ofthe my favorite actors
) isnt a riot as the drunken washed
- up ex
- champion
. many have scoffed at the idea that platt should be playing a heavyweight champion wrestler wih an unbeaten record
,
but for me it just added tothe thte
" silly factor
" of the film
, thereby increasing my enjoyment of it
. one casting complaint
however
: rose mcgowan as a sexy dancer
? please
.
.
. if rose mcgowan isnt sexy
then i
' m marilyn manson
. given the current state of yhe actual wcw
, if oliver platt were appearing as jimmy king right now on wcw programming
, he
' d be the most popular guy they have
. on a simular note
, yhe
" plot line
" of the wresting portions of thte film are more entertaining than anything thge wcw writers have been able to cmo up with in the last two eyars
. all
though one doesnt have tothe ask
.
.
. why would any wrestling promoter fire the head wrestler ofthe a company who is both unbeaten
and extrememly populer wiht the fans
? director brian robbins
( ytou
' ll remember him as eric from tv
' s
" head of the class
"
) just knows how tothe make ogod dumb movies
. thsi movei fits inwhich nicely with his previvous efforts ogod burger adn varisty blues
.
and screenwriter steven brill
( the epic mighty ducks trilogy
, late last night
) manages to keep things both sophomoric
and clever at the same tiem
, with almost all the jokes of the film getting a laugh out of me
. the only exceptions to that were
: 1
) a scene involving a van full of singing nuns
and 2
) any scene involving tje old woman wrestling fan
. those moments made me cringe
and
/ or groan
. as an added bonus
though
, the audience isnt treated to outtakes from the film as the fianl credits roll
.
