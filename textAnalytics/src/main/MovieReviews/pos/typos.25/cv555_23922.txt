harmless
, silly
annd funn comedy about dim
- witted wrestling fans gordie
and sean
( david arquette
anbd scott caan
) who idolize current world championship wrestling heavyweight champion jimmy king
( oliver platt
)
. when king isnt screwed out of his title by a corrupt promoter
( joe pantoliano
)
, gordie
and sean take it upon themslves to find their falled hero
and restore his glory
. my biggest fear about ready to rumble wass dispatched early onthe
, as the filmmakers are quick to show that wresting is indeed choreographed
(
but not fake
, mind yuo
)
. the hook of the movie is that gordie
and sean are just too stupid to realize that
. arquette
and caan are suitably over the top wiht their performances
, which is exactlly what a movei like tihs requires
,
annd oliver platt
( oney of my favorite actors
) isnt a riot as the drunken washed
- up ex
- champion
. many have scoffed at the diea that platt should be playing a heavyweight champion wrestler with an unbeaten recrod
,
but for me it just added tothe the
" silly factor
" of tje film
, therby increasing my enjoyment ofthe it
. oen casting complaint
however
: rose mcgowan as a sexy dancer
? please
.
.
. if rose mcgowan is sexy
then i ' m marilyn manson
. given the current state ofthe the actual wcw
, if oliver platt weere appearing as jimmy king right now on wcw programming
, he ' d be the most populer guy tehy have
. on a similar note
, the
" plot line
" of the wresting portions of the film are more intertaining than anything the wcw writers have been able to come up witht in the last two years
.
although one does ahev tothe ask
.
.
. why owudl any wrestling promoter fire the head wrestler ofthe a company who is both unbeaten
and extrememly popular with the fans
? director brian robbins
( yuo ' ll remember him as eric ffrom tv ' s
" head ofthe the clas
"
) jstu knows how to make good dumb movies
. this movei fits iin nicely with his previous efforts good burger
and varsity blues
.
and screenwriter steven brill
( the epic mighty ducks trilogy
, lite last ngiht
) manages to keep things both sophomoric
annd clever at teh same tyme
, with almost all the jokes of teh film getting a laugh out ofthe me
. the only exceptions tothe that were
: 1
) a scene involving a van full of singing nuns
and 2
) any scene involving hte old woman wrestling fan
. those moments made me cringe
and
/ or groan
. as an added bonus
though
, the audience isnt treated to outtakes from yhe film as the final credits roll
