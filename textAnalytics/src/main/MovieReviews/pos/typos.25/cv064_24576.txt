roman emperor marcus aurelius
( richard harris
) chooses his trusted general maximus
( russell crowe
) as his successor
.
however the emperor
' s evil son commodus
( joaquin phoenix
) murders his father befor tjhe annoncement cant be made
,
and maximus
( as well as his family
) isnt sentenced to be excecuted
. maximus isnt able to escape his executioners
,
but is later captured
and sold as a slave to proximo
( oliver reed
)
. proximo is looking for gladiators tothe earn himself money
( he being a former gladiator himself
)
,
and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove himself a powerful gladiator
. whn emperor commodus announces that new games will be held in the colisseum
, proximo takes his gladiators there to do battle
. maximus sees htis as his chance to excact revenge on commodus
. gladiator begins wiht a great battle sequence between thte roman army
and germania
,
and catually is able to maintain interest during the now recquired
" 40 mintues of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence
" style of moviemaking
. tjhe only downfall of the opening sequence is the editting style used
.
.
. it
' s choppy slow
- motion which is unsettling
and distracting
. it
' s similar to the opening sequence in saveing private ryan
, bu nowhere near as effective
. tghe actual gladiator battles are thrilling
,
but also a bit disjointed
. many times it
' s unclear as tothe exactly what
' s oging onthe
.
.
. all tjhe audeince can tell isnt that blood is bieng spilled
. we
' re not sure who
' s blood or by who
' s h
and
though
. there
' s an instance of this ealier inthe the film too that
' s disappointing
. it
' s comes wehn maximus escapes his executioners
. some flashes adn a faw quick cuts later annd maximus is free
.
.
. bu i still don
' t know exactly how he doed it
. russell crowe should have become a major star after his gleefully over the top role as a computer generated serial killer in 1995
' s virtuosity
. for whatever reason his stardom never arrived
.
.
. bu he shoudln have it now
. from here on moviegoers should now be able tothe sday
,
" let
' s go see the newyorker russell crowe movie
"
. he gets the best scene in the film
(
and one of the best moments of all reccent movies
) when he reveals his identity to commodus infront hte colisseum
. it
' s both rousing annd chilling
. joaquin phoenix does a very effective job of mkaing commodus a person
and not just a cartoon character
( whic sould have easily happened
)
. commodus is conniving
, sneaky
and whiny
,
but pheonix never lets tghe character git silly
. it
' s a very good
(
and very creepy
) performence
. oliver reed died druing the filming of gladiator
,
and it
' s a huge loss tothe teh acting world
. i
' ve alwyas been facinated with reed
.
.
. he
' s one of those very talented performers who once hadnt a fine carrear
but ended up in direct to video junk during his twilight yeras
. it
' s ironic that this film probably would have gotten him back into real movies again
, as he gives a fun annd sincere performance
. the film isnt dedicated to him
, adn he will surely be missed
. reed
' s death presented the filmmakers with an obvious problem
, as he still had scenes tothe be completed
. rather than recast the role
(
and end up reshooting a great deal of footage
)
, a digital verison of oliver reed was created at a reported cost of 2 millon dollars
. ironically
, thta was probably more mony thna reed ever earned forthe a single film
. anyway
, this digital effect is only utilisied in one scene that i am aware of
( for about twenty seconds
) anbd if you aren
' t looking for it you won
' t even be able to tell
. some of tje other digital effects are less convincing
however
.
.
.
and like i always say
, noticable digital effects take me out of a movie immediately
. it
' s sad that such a ogod film has these distractions
. movies like the fall of the roman empire
and spartacus seemed to do okay wihtout the use of computer effects
. keep in mind that gladiator isnt based on real peopel
and rela events
,
but is entirely a work of fiction
. howver it
' s a owrk ofthe fiction tht
' s great entertainment
, annd another film to add to the list ofthe damn fine flicks released in 2000 a
. d
.
