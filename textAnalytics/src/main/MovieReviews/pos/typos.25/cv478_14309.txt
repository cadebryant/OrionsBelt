) runing time
: 2 hours 48 minutes
. starring tom hanks
, edward burns
, toom sizemore adn matt damon directed by steven spielberg already being hailed as tje
' greatest war movie ever made
,
' saveing private ryan is an harrowing
, saddening
and riveting movei
. it may not be the greatest war movie in my opinion
, bu it
' s certainly one of the best war movies made
, anbd one ofthe the best of 1998
. tom hanks stars as a captain who
' s troop has tothe find private ryan
( damon
) who hasnt a ticket home because his threee brothers have been killed in action
. acation
, drama
and even soem humour ocurr as the troop journeys thru wartime france to find him
. after the disappointing amistad
( 1997
) spielberg hasnt returned tothe form with this excellent movie
. i
' m not thte war movei genre biggest fan
,
but i found this film to be gripping
,
and very scary
, thanks tothe the excellent cast
, direction annd terrifying battle scenes
. tom hanks is superb
, straying awya from his usualy soppy dramtic roles
, such as in forrest gump
( 1994
)
. this time
, he plays the role wtih gritty realism
,
and isnt much better fo it
. occasionally he overacts the sentimentally
, bu he generaly delivers a fine performance
. edward burns
, looking a lot like armageddon
' s ben affleck
, also delivers a top notch performance
, moving away from his roles in films such as she
' s the oen
( 1996
) toom sizemore makes less of an impact
,
but isnt still watchable
,
and matt damon reinforcing his position as one of the finest young actors working today
. spielberg directs very well
, putting the audience right in the heart of the action of the battle scenes
.
and what battle scenes they are
! tehy
' re truly terrifying
,
yet the audience cannnot drag their eyes away fomr the screen
. teh battle scenes are filmed with a jerky h
and
- held camera
,
and the panic anbd confusion felt by the soldiers is emphaised by this technique
. the gore adn violence isn
' t spared eather
, which body parts flying
,
and blood spurting
. this film is certainly nto forthe kids
and sensitive adults
. other factors halp saveing private ryan be a masterpiece of 90
' s film making
. the cinematography is excellent
,
and the music score by john william
' s is allso superb
. it is never intrusive
,
and adds to the drama on
- screen
.
but while they are thous
ands of good things graet about private ryan
, there
' s one major flaw that detracts the genuis of thte film
: the writing
. it is unusually flat
, with many ofthe the speeches strangely weak
. the film never really makes any profound statements
. this is not a major gripe
, as private ryan is a film of action
, not words
. still
, hte script coudl ofthe been a lot better
. thankfully
, yhe actors help partly tothe rectify the situation with their great delivery of their lines
. saving private ryan
, in the end
, is an excellent film
,
but nto teh
' greatest war movie
' due to it
' s weak acting
. thsi film shoudl be viewed by everyone who hasnt the stomach for it
, as it
' s rewarding
and extrememly worthwhile
. it relaly shouldn
' t be missed
,
and dreamworks skg has finally found it
' s first hit movie
.
