, edward burns
, tom sizemore
and matt damon directed by steven spielberg already bieng hailed as the ' greatest war movie ever made
, ' saving private ryan is an harrowing
, saddening
and riveting movei
. it may not be the greatest war movie in my opinyon
,
but it ' s certainly one ofthe the best war movies made
,
anbd noe of the best ofthe 1998
. tom hanks stars as a captain who ' s troop has to find private ryan
( damon
) who has a ticket home becouse his three brothers have been killed in action
. action
, drama
and even some humour occour as tghe troop journies through wartime france to fidn him
. after the disappointing amistad
( 1997
) spielberg has returned to form withthe htis excellent movei
. i ' m nto the war movie genre biggest fan
,
but i found htis film to be gripping
,
and very scary
, thanks to the excellent cast
, direction
anbd terrifying battle scenes
. tom hanks is superb
, straying awya ffrom his usually suppy dramatic roles
, such as in forrest gump
( 1994
)
. tihs time
, he plays the role with gritty realism
,
and is much better for it
. occasionalyl he overacts the sentimentally
,
but he generally delivers a fine performance
. edward burns
, looking a lot like armageddon ' s ben affleck
, also delivers a top notch performance
, moving awya from his roles inspite films such as she ' s thte one
( 1996
) toom sizemore makse less of an inpact
,
but isnt still watchable
,
annd matt damon reinforcing his position as one of the finest young actors working today
. spielberg directs very well
, putting the audience right in yhe heart of the action of the battle scenes
.
and what battle scenes they are
! they ' re truly terrifying
,
yot tghe audiance cannnot drag their eyes away from the screen
. the battle scenes are filmed with a jerky hand
- held camera
,
annd the panic
and confusion felt by the soliders is emphasized by this technique
. the gore
and violence isn ' t spred either
, which body parts flying
,
and blood spurting
. this film is certainly nto forthe kids
and senstive adults
. other factors help saving private ryan be a masterpiece of 90 ' s film makeing
. the cinematography isnt excellent
,
and the music score by john william ' s is also superb
. it is never intrusive
,
and adds to tje drama onthe
- screen
.
but while they are thousands of good things great about private ryan
, there ' s noe major flaw that detracts the genius of the film
: the wirting
. it is unusually flat
, with many of the speeches strangely weak
. the film never realy makes any profound statememts
. htis is not a major gripe
, as private ryan is a film ofthe action
, not words
. still
, the script coudl of beeen a lot better
. thankfully
, the actors help partly tothe rectify the situation witht their great delivery ofthe their lines
. saving private ryan
, infront the end
, is an excellent film
,
but not hte ' greatest war movei ' due to it ' s weak acting
. this film shoud be viewed by everyone who hasnt tjhe stomach forthe it
, as it ' s rewarding
and extremely worthwhile
. it really shouldn ' t be missed
,
and dreamworks skg hasnt fianlly found it ' s frist hit movei
.
