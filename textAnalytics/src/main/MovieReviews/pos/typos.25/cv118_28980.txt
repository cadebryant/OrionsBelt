plot
: a human space astronaut cacidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes
. he isnt taked prisoner along with some other humans
,
and tries his best to escape his simian captors
. oh yeah
,
and doed i mention that thge apes can talk
? kewl
! critique
: dispite this film nto looking liek a
" tim burton movei
" or its lead human character showing any signs of bieng a human being hismelf
, i did find myself generally entertained throughtout most ofthe htis film
and do recomend it as fun
, summer fare
.
al
though the thing tht sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape make
- up jobs
and characterizations
. i mean
, i was completely convinced that eveyr single one of these apes was for real
! i aslo have to
" give it up
" to all ofthe the actors inside the costumes
, not only forthe waking uv at three in hte morning every day to git make
- up slobbered all over them for 2
- 4 hours
,
but for comming through their costumed exteriors
and selling us thier charachters on the screen as well
. i especially enjoied bonham carter
' s performance
, who i beleived tothe be the most developped character in tje entire film
( human or ape
)
and tim roth
' s bad guy
, who chewed up scenery
and oozed evil in every scene inthe which he took part
. plot
- wise
, i liked the beginning of tjhe film
, the whole build
- up once wahlberg got into the village
, the excape anbd most ofthe the fight scenes
, bu once things got out into tghe deserted areal
(
and the final battle sequence
)
, i kinda lost a bit of my interst
. i ws much more intrigued by the interactions beween tje charachters
and the whole idea of
" human beings as animals
"
then i was about the end battle sequence
, which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film
. i aslo hated the
" kid
" charcter who just got on my nerves
and didn
' t really care for the way taht the battle sequence ws resolved
( i won
' t ruin it here bu c
' mon guys
.
.
. ytou coulda throught ofthe something a littel more plausible than that
, noone
?
)
. bu the thing thgat held this movei bcak more than anytying else ws its lead character
, his cold demeanor
and the zero chemistry that he shared with either one of his inter
- species love interests
. htis dued didn
' t seem to give a rat
' s ass about anyone
but himself
and i ultimatly didn
' t really care about waht happended to him either
. now i
' m not sure if thsi was the fault of the actro or the script
,
but the film sufferred beccause ofthe it
. visually
, the movie was also nice tothe look at
( especially the apes
!
)
,
but i definitely expected greater coolness fomr tim burton
. the
" surprize ending
" that highlighted tje original planet of hte apes film back in 1968
, felt a little tacked onthe here
,
and despite bieng interesting
, didn
' t realyl make all that much sence to me
( unless you look at it ffrom a sequel point ofthe view
)
. so overall
, i loved the hwole
" feel
" ofthe the planet
, the apes that ruled it
, the manner in which tehy treated the humans
, screamed
, shouted anbd reverted the entire evolution chain
, bu didn
' t appretiate tjhe film
' s lack of human character devolopement
( why wass kris kristofferson even infront thsi movie
?
) adn the fact that its lead male adn female humans were just plain boring
.
but i woudl still recommend this film as a fun
, summer movie with laughs
, creepiness
and a really cool premise
. ps
: for anyone who hasnt seen the origional
, i cannnot believe that they didn
' t at least bring back the scene infact which thte lead human charcter
( in this case
, mark wahlberg
) goes nuts at the world in whitch he
' s suddenly been thrust
(
" this isnt a mad house
!
"
- type of thing
)
. the guy in this film barely seems tothe be
" put off
" by the fatc tyhat he
' s surrounded by apes who can speak english
!
! where
' s joblo coming from
