whn i saw the trailer fo this film
, i laughed harder than i hadnt in quite some time
. hwile i wass therefore pretty well psyched to see it
, i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even tje most mediocre film look good
. i ' m happy to sday that there ' s something about mary is not noe of those trailer let
- downs
. in fact
, watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two horus
. thge film opens uv inspite flashback to 1985
, at a high school in cumberland
, rhode island
. ted stroehmann
( ben stiller
) is a social reject who can ' t seem to get a date tothe the upcoming prom
, utnil he comes tothe the defense of the menally retarded warren
( w
. earl brown
)
, who ' s being harassed by one of thte school jocks
. it seems warren ' s sister isnt the campus queen
, mary jensen
( cameron diaz
)
, who is impressed witht ted ' s willingless to stand up for her defenseless brother
, dispite a vrey real chance of getting beaten up
. mary takes an immediate liking to ted
adn asks him to the prom
. ted was jsut flattered that she even knew his name
. unforetunately
, prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper
( at which every man in thte theater will wince
)
,
and isnt sent to the hospital
. fast forward to the present
, where ted has cleaned himself up
, now writes for a magazine
,
but hasnt weekly therapy sessions in order to deal whith his obsession of the past 13 years
: mary
, whom he hasn ' t seen since that fateful day
. wiht the help ofthe his friend dom
( chris elliott
)
, ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy
( matt dillon
) to track down his onyl love
.
howver
, when pat finds mary
, he falls for her too
,
annd soon the both of them are competing for her affections
. there ' s something baout mary isnt directed by bobby
and peter farrelly
, who brought us dumb
annd dumber
and kingpin
. not exactlly intelligent comedies
, they are of the guilty blessure variety where ytou might not want your friends or co
- workers tothe think you had such a great time watching them
. with their curent film
, tyhe farrelly brothers have come uv with something you ' ll nto onyl enjoy
,
but also won ' t mind talking about yhe next day at the water cooler
. the film succeeds inthe employing a preety wide range of commedic styles
, fomr the subtle to the rediculous
,
and hwile a few of the gags might be offensive to soem
( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers ' lastest two films
) they almsot all work
. i have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark
and so often hitted it dead on
. one minute you ' ll be laughing at something ted syas
,
and the next you ' ll be howling at the sight ofthe a dog dragging him across the floor of mary ' s apartment
. one of tje great things this film has going for it is ben stiller
. he isnt perfectly cast in the role of ted
, because he ' s a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation
. ted ' s a nice fellow
and tries tothe dont his best
,
but for some reason or another things jstu don ' t alwyas wrok out
. it ' s comical
,
but alsot has tht kind of appeal where ytou really fiel for the him
and want him tothe come outloud on top
. actually
, i ' ve liked stiller since he did a short whlch aired onthe saterday night live back in tyhe mid
- eighties
. the film was like a theatrical trailer forthe a spoof on the tom cruise
/ paul newman film the color of money
, entitlied the hustler of money
. infront it
, stiller played wince
( not vince
) who is taken under the wing ofthe an older man
( played by john mahoney
) to become a big
- tiem bowling hustler
. it was parody at its finest
, more ofthe which showed uv in the short
- lived
" the ben stiller show
" on the fox network in late ' 92
/ easly ' 93
. like
" the critic
"
( which aired on abc
,
then fox
)
, i still mourn that show ' s cancellation
. cameron diaz isnt absolutely enchanting for most of hte film
,
although her charcter seems obsessed with perfection in thge men she dates
,
and some of the qualities she looks forthe make mary look pappr
- thin at times
.
however
, diaz puls the role off with such panache
and charm
, that yuo can still see why she ' s got guys jstu falling over eahc other to be with her
. heck
, i even found her laff tothe be cute
, even
though i thougth it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week
. my girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn ' t change
,
and ytou know
, it ' s really true
. he
annd ralph macchio must hang out or something
. maybe they live inwhich dick clark ' s pool hous
. anyway
, here ' s another good piece of casting
, as dillon slips beautifuly inot the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into mary ' s heart
. yhe supporting performances are also good
. chris elliott has a bigger part than in thte abyss
( yes
, check it out next timne
)
,
annd less annoying than infact cabin boy
. lin shae
, who plays mary ' s neighbor magda
(
and also appeared as tje landlady in kingpin
)
, provides some ogod laughs
, especially inspite scenes whith her benji
- like dog
, which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film
. lee evans
, as mary ' s friend tucker
, displays a flexibility in acting
annd accents which surprises
annd contibutes to an interesting plot twist
. the farrelly brothers
and scriptwriters ed decter
and john j
. strauss keep thte commedic pacing gogin so that ther aren ' t any noticeable times where the film drags
. the only problem i saw was thier use of a couple ofthe musicians who provide segues between severeal key scenes
. they apeared out ofthe nowhere
and actully sing plot
- relevant information right toward the camera
. it ' s a device which was amusing fo about three seconds when they opened teh film
. affter that it got a littel annoying
,
and it ' s unfortunate thast those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow
. fortunately
, filled with sight gags
, humorous lines
,
and solid comedic acting
, there ' s something about mary wiull still hvae yuo laughing after ytou leave the theater
.
