when i saw the trailer for this film
, i laughed harder thna i had in quite smoe time
. hwile i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it
, i was ever mindful thgat a trailer cin make even teh most mediocre film look ogod
. i
' m hapyp to say that there
' s something about mary is not one of those trailer let
- downs
. inthe fact
, watching this film was quite a fine way to spend twpo hurs
. the film opens up inthe flashback tothe 1985
, at a high school in cumberl
and
, rhode isl
and
. ted stroehmann
( ben stiller
) is a social reject who can
' t seem tothe git a date to tje upcoming prom
, until he comes to the defense ofthe the mentally retarded warren
( w
. earl brown
)
, who
' s being harased by one of thte school jocks
. it seems warren
' s sister is thte campus queen
, mary jensen
( cameron diaz
)
, who isnt impressed with ted
' s willingless to st
and up fo her defenseless brother
, despite a veyr real chance ofthe getting beaten uv
. mary takes an immediate liking to ted anbd asks him to the prom
. ted was jstu flattered thast she even knew his nmae
. unfortunately
, prom nght is ruined when ted hasnt an accident witht his zipper
( at which every man in the theater will wince
)
, anbd is sent tothe the hospital
. fast forward to the present
, where ted has cleaned himself up
, now writes for a magazine
, bu has weekly therapy sessions in order tothe deal with his obsession of the past 13 years
: mary
, whom he hasn
' t seen since that fateful day
. with the halp of his friend dom
( chris elliott
)
, ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy
( matt dillon
) to track down his only love
.
however
, when pat finds mary
, he falls forthe her too
,
and soon the both ofthe them are competing for her affections
. there
' s something about mary is directed by bobby anbd peter farrelly
, who brought us dumb
and dumber
and kingpin
. nto exactly intelligent comedies
, they are of the gilty pleasure variety where you might not whant your friends or co
- workers to tihkn you had such a gerat tyme watching them
. withthe their current film
, the farrelly brothers have come up with something you
' ll nto only enjoy
,
but also won
' t mind talking about the next day at the water cooler
. the film succeds in employing a pretty wide range ofthe comedic styles
, from the subtle to the ridiculous
,
and while a fewd ofthe the gags might be offensive to some
( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers
' last two films
) they almost all work
. i have not seen many movies in yhe recent past that shoot for the mark
and so oftenly hit it dead on
. one minute you
' ll be laughing at something ted says
,
and hte next you
' ll be howling at tghe sight of a dog dragging him accross tjhe floor of mary
' s apartment
. one ofthe the gerat things this film has going for it isnt ben stiller
. he is perfectly cast in the role of ted
, because he
' s a guy who just looks awcward in almost every situation
. ted
' s a nice fellow
and tries to dont his best
, bu for some reason or another thnigs just don
' t always work out
. it
' s comical
,
but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel forthe tghe him
and whant him to come out on top
. actually
, i
' ve liked stiller since he did a short wich aired on saturday nihgt live back in the mid
- eighties
. the film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on tje tom cruise
/ paul newman film the colour of mnoey
, entitled the hustler ofthe mney
. in it
, stiller played wince
( not vince
) who is taken under tjhe wing of an older man
( played by john mahoney
) to become a big
- time bowling hustler
. it was parody at its finest
, more of which showed uv in the short
- lieved
" the ben stiller show
" on the fox network in late
' 92
/ early
' 93
. like
" the critic
"
( which aired on abc
,
then fox
)
, i still mourn taht show
' s cancellation
. cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film
,
al
though her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates
,
and soem of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper
- thin at times
.
however
, diaz puls the role off wtih such panache
and charm
, tath yuo cxan still see why she
' s got guys just falling over each other tothe be with her
. heck
, i even found her laugh tothe be cute
, even
though i throught it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight sohw last week
. my girlfriend remarked tath matt dillon doesn
' t chanage
,
and you know
, it
' s really true
. he annd ralph macchio must hang out or something
. mabey they live in dick clark
' s pool house
. anyway
, here
' s another good piece of casting
, as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who trys to worm his way into mary
' s heart
. the supporting performances are also good
. chris elliott hasnt a bigger part than in the abyss
( yes
, check it outloud enxt tiome
)
,
and less annoying than in cabin boy
. lin shae
, who plays mary
' s neighobr magda
( anbd also appeared as the l
andlady in kingpin
)
, provides some good laughs
, especially in scenes with her benji
- like dog
, whcih acts as thge focal point for a few ofthe hte funniest moments of the film
. lee evans
, as mary
' s friend tucker
, displays a flexibility in acting
and accents which surprises
and contri
butes to an interesting plot twist
. the farrelly brothers anbd scriptwriters ed decter
and john j
. strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that htere aren
' t any noticeable times where teh film drags
. the onyl problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between sevral key scenes
. they appear out of nowhere
and actually sing plot
- relevant information right toward the camera
. it
' s a device hwihc was amusing for baout three seconds whn they oppened thte film
. after that it got a littel annoying
,
and it
' s unfortunate that those spots interupt waht would otherwise be a smooth flow
. fortunately
, filled with sight gags
, humorous lines
,
and solid comedic acting
, htere
' s something about mary will still ahev you laughing affter you leave the theather
.
