john von neumann
, progenitor ofthe the computer age
and critically important mathmatician onthe tyhe manhattan project
, pointed out long ago tht htere is a great way to explore the cosmos
, even without recourse tothe faster
- tahn light travel
. you send outloud self
- replicating robot ships which explore
and raio bakc information
. it may take decades
, centuries
, or millennia
,
but it cxan be done with achievable technology
,
and doesn
' t recquire a magical faster
- than
- light drive
. in the fifties
, british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better tothe radio plans fo a complex coputer
and a program for it
; any civilization capable ofthe receiving the transmission could build the computer
, whihc would
then engage infact a real
- time dialouge with the aliens
, exchanging information
and technologies
,
and hopefully arranging to send back what it hadnt learned
. about thirty
- five eyars ago
, the bbc contracted witht astronomer
/ writer fred hoyle
and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a mini
- series called a fo
andromeda
. afa conserned the reception ofthe a hoyle transmission
, the construction ofthe a huge computer
, the computer
' s anaylsis of life on earth
,
and its creation of an aparently human intermediary tothe faciltate communication
. she was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by thge
then
- unknown julie christie
. audience response was so storng thast the bbc contracted fo a sequel
,
andromeda breakthrough
, which played to equally high ratings
. dennis feldman
, whose previous credits include tyhe golden child
, has never beeen noted forthe coherent
, well
- structured movie scripts
; they strat outloud great
, adn thn disintegrate into a morass of chase
and action
, mitigated onyl by teh presence of the obligatory beautyfull girl
. feldman writes good scenes
,
but has no diea how to tell a story or write a movie
, even with a previous version tothe use as a model
. now
, in species
, we have a mundane retread ofthe the
andromeda plotline
, derailed by a preocupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady
and further ruined by a medicore attempt to emulate several recent horror films inwhich terms of splatter
, gore
,
and chases
. species features ben kingsley
, who is completely wasted in a badly
- writed portrayal of a feebly amoral scientist
. forrest whitaker
and alfred molina are alsot served poorly by the script
. the species story is realitvely simple
; we have been radioing information about ourselves anbd our dna outloud into space since 1971
,
and have been receiving answers for twpo eyars
.
( note that
, in the 1970
' s
, we really didn
' t nkow diddly baout the human genome structure
,
and were hardly in a possition tothe radio out a set of blueprints for human beings
. even today
, all we can do is give informtion about dna
and how it works
, not a copy of human dna
, because we don
' t have it analyzed
yet
.
) the answers we get from the unkown alien source are plans for recreating a member of the alien race
,
and doctor xavier finch
, palyed by ben kingsley
, is placed in charge of the attept
. teh script beggins to go off the deep end at this point
, when thge result isnt a beautyfull young girl who can shape
- shift into any of several ugly alien life forms
. the first half of the film has something to offer
, as
" sil
,
" the alien girl
, struggles with her multi
- form existenec
, changing from beauty to lizard tothe giant cockroach
and back again
, all while trying to underst
and her own place in tyhe cosmos
. she seems oddly knowledgeable about human society
, wtih glaring gaps where her social skills should be
. her instincts are to mate
and procreate
,
and some ofthe the best scenes deel wtih her attemts in this areal
. escaping from her birth laboratory in utah
, sil is pursued by a team of drafted civilians with orders to find her
and kill her
. she goes onthe an eating binge
, spins herself a cocoon
,
and emerges as an adult
, played by natasha henstridge
, who goes a long way toward re
- creating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in 1960
. the pursuers
: michael madsen is an assasins
/ exterminator
; forrest whitaker is a convenient empath
/ psychic
, just as
though teh u
. s
. government actually hadnt such people on call
. niether is able to do much with the writing
and directing provided
. whitaker
' s role seems to be aimed at making whitaker a male copy of star trek
: yhe next generation
' s
" counselor cleavage
.
" the otehr members of the strike team are played by marg helgenberger
and alfred molina
. kingsley
and whitaker are both consumate professionals
, too good to not owrk to the best ofthe their abilities
;
but the performances donaldson elicided from the rest ofthe hte cast are disappointing
and bl
and
, anbd it is apparent thta tghe direction wass a bit weak
. h
. r
. giger
' s desgin for the main form of tyhe alien creature is actually a bit boring when we finally get to see it
,
al
though previvous digital effects were done quite smoothly
. the main fault ofthe species is lack of originality
; it starts outloud wtih a wonderful
, albeit borrowed
, premise
,
and
then doesn
' t live up to it
. all we get are chase scenes anbd a few nice sex scenes
, with a few monsters tossed infront
. there is no buildup of tension
and suspense
, no climax worthy of the name
; speices is just a sequence ofthe
" scare
" scenes stuck together
. the movie isnt carried by its chase
and sex scenes
,
but nto rescued by them
. on the other h
and
, as an exercise in sci
- fi action
/ adventure
, it certainly beats the ichor out of judge dredd
. speices earns an extra rating point or two for having ben kingsley adn natasha henstridge on board
,
but by
and large
, it
' s funn only for those of us who really like this sort ofthe thing
. my personal rating is threee stars
,
but knock one or two of those off if ytou don
' t enjoy pretty unclothed ladies adn bloodthirsty alien monsters
