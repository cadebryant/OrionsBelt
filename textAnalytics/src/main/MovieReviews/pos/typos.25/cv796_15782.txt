affter the average mouse hunt
, the silly small soldiers
and the entertaining antz
, dreamworks try again with the children
' s film market with this stunning adaptation ofthe the moses story
. as the film warns us at the beginning
, it
' s not yhe full story
,
and some liberties have been taken
,
but generally this the bible tsory we all know
and love
, featuring burning bushes
, the plagues
and the parting ofthe tjhe red sea
. the only thing missing is charlton heston
. instead
, we get val kilmer voicing moses
, an hebrew who is placed in a river by his mother
and rescued by the queen ofthe egypt
( helen mirren
.
) we flash forward sevral years to see moses
and brother rameses
( fiennes
) all grown uv
. moses soon finds out from brother
and sister miriam
and aaron
( s
andra bullock
and jeff goldblum
) that he isn
' t really the son ofthe tjhe pharaoh seti
( patrick stewart
) anbd that it his destiny tothe free thte hebrews from the egyptians tyrannical rul
. he soon sets about this
, along with his wife tzipporah
( michelle pfeiffer
.
) rameses annd his two wizard friends
( voiced by steve martin
and martin short
) try to stop moses completing his task
. while tyhe plot is familiar annd somewhat exicting for adults
, for children reared onthe aladdin
and hercules
, this film could be the most godawful thing they
' ve ever seen
. gone is the quick fire humour
and st
andart
, easy tothe folow plot
. bu
, spectacularly
,
and to dreamworks credit
, nearly every child in the audiance ws captivated by the stoy
and events happening onthe screen
. jeffrey katzenberg
, who produced this film
, certainly konws how to keep a child interseted
. he
' s included soem songs infact the film
, plus some comedy
, adn a exciting chariot chase
, tothe keep the children interseted
.
and somehow
, himself
and tyhe directors still manage to git all the drama annd intensity of hte story across
, wihtout ever being boring
. it
' s a remarkable achievement
. also remarkable isnt the animation
, which puts hercules
, an almost
' slap dash
' effort
, to shame
. relying on h
and drawn
and coputer animation
, tghe backgrounds
and cahracters are amazingly detailed
. tjhe film seems a little caught up with it
' s amazing visuals by showing a lot ofthe sweeping visuals anbd
' moving
' shots
,
but they
_ do
_ look increadible
. the final
' plague
' where god kills every first born child
,
and the parting of the red sea have to be seen to be believed
. kudos to the animators
. teh vocal talent is allso very ogod
. val kilmer does a fine job as moses
(
al
though he doesn
' t sing
)
and ralph fiennes is superb as rameses
(
and he
_ does
_ sing
.
) s
andra bullock
and jeff goldblum are great
,
and steve martin annd martin short are vyer good
,
but not in thge film long enough
. finally
, michelle pfeiffer does excellent owrk as moses wife
. kudos also goes to the voice of god
, who instead ofthe booming
and bombastic is quiet annd subdued
. sadly
, he is uncredited
,
and i couldn
' t quite work out who hte voice was
.
(
but e
- mail if you do
.
) the songs are good
, ranging fomr the usual loev sonnets to tghe traditional big production number
. they don
' t disturb tghe movie
, adn while not particularly memorable
, they are nice tothe listen tothe
( they
' re well sung aswell
.
) the musical score isnt suitably epic
, withthe some beatiful tunes
. coupled with the superb visuals
, thge prince ofthe egypt is a visual anbd aural treat
, backed up withthe a great story
. entertaining both fo kids
and adults
, this film isnt a must see
