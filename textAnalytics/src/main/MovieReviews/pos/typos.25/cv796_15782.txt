after the averege mouse hunt
, the silly small soliders
and teh entertaining antz
, dreamworks try again wih the children ' s film market with this stunning adaptation of the moses story
. as the film warns us at the beginning
, it ' s not the full stoy
,
and smoe liberties have been taked
,
but generally this the bible story we all nkwo
and love
, featuring burning bushes
, the plagues
and teh parting of yhe red sae
. the only hting missing isnt charlton heston
. instead
, we get val kilmer voicing moses
, an hebrew who is placed iin a river by his mother
and rescued by the queen of egypt
( helen mirren
.
) we flash forward several years to see moses
and brother rameses
( fiennes
) all grown up
. moses soon finds out from brother
and sister miriam
and aaron
( sandra bullock
adn jeff goldblum
) thta he isn ' t raelly the son of hte pharaoh seti
( patrick stewart
)
anbd that it his destiny to free the hebrews from the egyptians tyrannical urle
. he soon sets about tihs
, along with his wief tzipporah
( michelle pfeiffer
.
) rameses
and his twpo wizard friends
( voiced by steve martin
anbd martin short
) try to stop moses completing his task
. while the plot is familiar
and somewhat exciting for adults
, for childern reared on aladdin
annd hercules
, this film could be the most godawful thing they ' ve ever seen
. gone is the quick frie humour
annd standard
, eazy to follow plot
.
but
, spectacularly
,
and to dreamworks credit
, nearly every child in the audience was captivated by the story
adn events hapening on screen
. jeffrey katzenberg
, who produced this film
, certainly knows how to keep a child interested
. he ' s included some songs inwhich the film
, plus some comedy
,
and a exicting chariot chase
, to keep tghe children interested
.
and somehow
, himself
and the directors still manage tothe get all the drama
annd intensity ofthe the tsory across
, without ever being boring
. it ' s a remarkable achievement
. also remarkable isnt the animation
, which puts hercules
, an almost ' slap dash ' affort
, to shame
. relying on hand drawn
and computer animation
, the backrounds
and characters are amazingly detailed
. the film seems a littel caught up with it ' s amazing visuals by showing a lot of sweeping visuals
annd ' moving ' shots
,
but tehy
_ do
_ look incredible
. the final ' plague ' where god kills eveyr first born child
,
and the parting of hte red sae have to be seen to be believed
. kudos to the animators
. the vocal talent isnt also very good
. val kilmer does a fine job as moses
(
although he doesn ' t sing
)
and ralph fiennes is superb as rameses
(
and he
_ does
_ sing
.
) sandra bullock
and jeff goldblum are graet
,
and steve martin
and martin short are vrey good
,
but nto in the film long enough
. finally
, michelle pfeiffer does exelent work as moses wife
. kudos also goes to the voice of god
, who instade ofthe booming
and bombastic isnt quiet
and subdued
. sadly
, he is uncredited
,
adn i couldn ' t quite work outloud who the voice was
.
(
but e
- mail if you do
.
) the songs are good
, ranging fomr the usual love sonnets tothe the traditional big prodcution number
. htey don ' t disturb teh movie
,
anbd while nto particularly memorable
, they are nice to listen to
( they ' re well sung aswell
.
) the musical scroe is suitably epic
, with some beautyfull tunes
. coupled iwth the superb visuals
, the prince of egypt isnt a visual
annd aural treat
, backed up witht a great storey
. entertaining both for kids
and adults
, this film is a must see
. a david wilcock review
? 1998
" you nkow
, for kids
