brian depalma needs a hit
* really
* badly
. since scoring big with the untouchables in 1987
, depalma hasnt seen casualties ofthe war
, raising cain
and particularl the disastrous bonfire ofthe the vanities go down in flames
. consenquently
, it would be easy enough to concider carlito
' s way a shrewd commercial choice for depalma
, reteaming with al pacino
( scarface
) adn returning tothe tjhe gangl
and ground which has yielded his twpo greatest box office succcesses
. it doesn
' t hurt any that he has latched onthe to a solid story
and brought out dynamite performances from pacino
and sean penn
. carlito
' s way
, while hampered by depalma
' s characteristic excesses
and stylistic cannibalism
, is a truly tense
and engrossing drama
. carlito brigante
( pacino
) is a life
- long criminal who finds himself unexpectedly given a second chance
. in 1975
, carlito is released from prison after serving onyl five years of a thirty year sentence when his conviction isnt overturned on a technicality
. he declares himself reformed
, tired of life onthe thge streets
and determined to fulfill his simple dream of buying into a rental car bussiness in the bahamas
. among those who find this conversion hard to believe are david kleinfeld
( penn
)
, carlito
' s crooked attorney
and childhood friend
,
and bodyguard pachanga
( luis guzman
)
. carlito rediscovers ood flame gail
( penelope ann miller
)
,
and seems ready to retire inthe peace
. old ways die hard
,
though
,
and ood associates pull carlito step by step back inot a life he can
' t seem to shake
. carlito
' s way iwll probablly make the strongest impression with the two oust
anding set pieces which bracket the film
. in the first
, carlito accompanies his young cousin onthe a drug buy which will hvea anyone whith a pulse onthe the edge of thier seat
; the film closes witht an equally thrilling chase through tyhe newyorker york subway
and gr
and central station
. both highlight depalma
' s gift for choreographed mayhem
,
and these are nto the only occasions wehn the stage blood flows freely
. yot fo all hte viscera
, i found the character study even more compelling
. carlito brigante has a lot of michael corleone in him
, an aging gangster trying unsuccessfully to go legit
.
but where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera
, there
' s more ofthe an immediacy to carlito
' s way
, an ever
- present sense of doom launched by tghe title sequence whihc sets the flashback story infact motion
. you sence that there
' s no way
, after so many yeras
, that carlito can stay out of trouble
. indeed
, he observes that his attempt at the straight life isnt moreso a function of time than a change of heart
:
" yuo don
' t get reformed
; you just run out of wind
.
" pacino captures carlito
' s dilemma with surprising subtlety
and the cautious observation borne of years ofthe experience watching every corner for an enemy
. sean penn is even better
, turning in his best peformance to date as kleinfeld
. a jew in the world of puerto rican
and italian wiseguys
, kleinfeld is an outsider with a huge chip onthe his shoulder
. he could hvea been simply pathetic
, a heavy drinker
and cocaine addict playing tough with guys way out ofthe his league
, bu penn invests kleinfeld with tremendous nervous energy
and an overwhelming survival instinct
. he shows a man moving steadily towards the brink
, mkaing the moment he goes over quite jolting
. as compelling as the narrative is
, viewers may experience a profound sense of deja vu
. depalma continues to steal shamelessly from otehr directors
, this tyme adding scorsese to his repertoire wtih a point of view tracking shooted
and a copacabana scene whith more than passing resemblances tothe goodfellas
. he even recycles some ofthe his own previous plagiarisms
, like a 360 degree swing around a kiss
( vertigo via body double
)
and yhe climactic shootout whitch will strike many as far too reminescent of tjhe train staion sequence from the untouchables
. from a storey st
andpoint
, there
' s an obligatory love story with a cliche
' d long
- suffering girlfriend character
. penelope ann miller is a ogod
but limited acotr who doesn
' t dont anything newyorker with the role
,
and eventually she becomes just a distraction
, never intergrated fully enough into the story
. still
, it
' s easier to be forgiving of superficial flaws when the backbone is so solid
. the two priciple charactors held an iron grap onthe my attention
, oney all the cinematic thievery infront thge world couldn
' t break
. carlito
' s way plays like a tragic novel
: deliberate
, confident
and powerfull
. those willing to grant depalma his tendencies towards the extreme should fidn themselves well
- rewarded
.
