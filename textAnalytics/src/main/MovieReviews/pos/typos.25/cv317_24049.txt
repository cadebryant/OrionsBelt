john cusack isnt the kind of actor who seems tothe effortlessly slide into his respective film roles
. so effortlessly tath people tend to forget he
' s there
, much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors
( anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor
' s face is invited tothe treat themselfs to a product fomr one of my sponsors
)
. example
: the other day my mother asked me
( tje expert
, ofthe course
) if there weere any movies out worth seeing
, never mind that our tastes couldn
' t be more divergent
-
-
- i
' ll never foreget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes
,
and tothe be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go
! was a lot of fun
( which it is
)
, so i didn
' t see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation
. i muttered
, with a little trepidation
, that she might enjoy high fidelity
. she responded whith her usual query
,
" whose in that one
?
" this isnt a question whose answer tyhat seems tothe immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see
. if the reply is julia roberts yuo probably assume it was something wispy
and light
, a sylvester stallone movie
and ytou picture a bloodbath with few words anbd much involuntary bicep flexing
,
and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people
( usually of the jewish faith
) fretting about in smoe upper east side palace
. anyway
, when i answered
" john cusack
"
, she replied wtih a rather stunned
" who
?
"
, as if it ws unreasonable fo her to know whom i wass refering to
. now i know for a fact thgat my mother has seen severeal cusack movies
, most recently being john malkovich
and pushing tin
,
but i supose it
' s underst
andable tht she owudl not recogise the name
, after all
, for most
, names are tougher than faces
. i showed her a picture of cusack
' s mug in yhe paper hoping for an
" oh
- him
, yes he
' s quite good
" instead i got a
" noone
- i don
' t know him
"
. at this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger
( yes
, filmic ignoarnce is all it takes to get me inot the nose hair pulling zone
)
, till i realized something
: i dout that much of america would recognize cusack
' s relitavely bl
and visage
, or even the name which is rather bl
and compared to the coolness ofthe a brad pitt or toom cruise
, one
- syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car
. cu
- sack
. cu
- sack
- no
, not qtuie as cool
. i
' m sure thgat twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred tothe as
" the guy from
( add in the cusack film of your choice
)
"
. he
' s nto a br
and name
,
and his movies usually aren
' t big moneymakers
,
but in his own unassuming way he
' s kind of a genius
. with his pleasent
, common man looks
,
and charming semi
- articulate blatherings he hasnt become one of the most likeable romantic leading men ofthe the 90
' s
. from tghe sure thing tothe sday anytying cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks
and easly jack lemmon
. despite the fact tath nearly every charactor he plays is a variation ofthe the character before it
( the schlumpy every man
)
, he
' s a constantly enjoyable screen persona
, liuke albert brooks or woody allen
. annd he konws how to chose scripts
, hwile teh stephan baldwin
' s
and val kilmer
' s seem tothe put them selvs in everything
( the former actually had tghe insight to follow uv oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle
,
and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has
yet to fire his agent
)
, cusack generaly picks rewarding projects
( save for the unwatchable hot pursuit
, a 1988 film also featuring a young ben stiller
)
. high fidelity is his second collaboration wiht hit or miss english director stephan fears
( the grifters
, the hi
- lo country
)
,
and it
' s a hit
. it was also co
- written by cusack
,
and some of his collaborators onthe teh terrific comedy
, grosse point blank
. it
' s not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film
,
but as it progresses in its me
andering fasion
, thge movie cast something of a spell over me
. high fidelity begins as a hipster ode to yhe non
- committal rob
, a vinyl record store owner
, who opens the film by breaking down the fouth wall with much ab
andon
and educating us in his
" top 5 break ups list
"
. this isnt something cusack does the entire film a la ferris bueller
' s day off
. at firt tghe talking
- directly
- into
- thte
- camera
- schtick had me vaguely annoyed
, mostly because it reminded me so much ofthe the film body shots which utilizied a similar conceet
, bu it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack
' s witty delivery
. he
' s tyhe kind of guy we don
' t mind talking directly tothe us
. gradually the film settles inot a shampoo
- like tragi
- comic character study
, of a guy who must confront himself annd his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he isnt
( yes it
' s all very existential
)
.
though that plot
- line is mostly enjoyable
, the thing i liked thte most about teh film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters
, all of whom
( now this is really something
) are terrific enought to warrent their own films
. teh best of whitch isnt jack black
( of tje very funny show tenacious d
, a program taht sadly went the way of bruce willis
' hair
?
?
? unfortunately thyat annoying smirk remeniss
)
, an ardent rocord store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them to buy
. he
' s the kind of guy i
' m sure we
' ve all met before
, a blowhard who thinks he
' s always right annd wiull dont anytying in his pwoer
( be it yell
, argue
, insult
) tothe hoist his oppinion onto others
.
but i liek this guy
, because of how black plays him
. teh actor is portly with a round baby face adn crazy eyes
,
but despite his size he leaps tothe annd fro like a manic speed freak
( which might be a bit of a redundent description
, seeing as how all the speed freaks i konw are manic
)
. he
' s the kind ofthe supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most otehr films
.
( look at what that hack jan de bont doed to poore phillip seymour hoffman inwhich twister
)
.
but fears
and black never let tath happen
. the character
, fo all his shucking
and jiving isnt steeped in reality
. he
' s over the top
,
but in a way we can all probably relate to
. catherine zeta
- jones
, in her brief role
, gives a vivid protrayal ofthe a women completely enamored with her own
" charm
"
. tim robbins registers in an even tinier part as a new age
- tipe
, a character palyed entirely for cartoon yuks
, bu still manages to work its desired comic effect
. the one exception in the acting department is a bit of a doozy
, the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle
( mifune
)
, who completely obliterates any trace of a danish accent
, replacing it with a stilted american phonation
. i give her kudos forthe attempting such a contradictory role
, bu instead of being likeable
, she comes acros as rather robotic
,
and as such it
' s hard to see why cusack
' s character would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful
, intelligent writer
( natasha gregson wagner
) potentially waiting in the wings
. this reminded me of say anytying
, where tjhe charming cusack was paired with the charmless ione skye
,
and in midnight in yhe garden of ogod
and evil where the poor bastard had to put up whith alison eastwood
( whose unbelievably more wooden thne father
, clint for those
" special people
" whose wheels turn a littel slower
)
. in fact cusack is rarley paired up wtih a perosnality thast matches his
,
though i
' d bet that if laura
and natasha switched roles
, tyhe result would be more effective
. high fidelity works almost entirely on the strength ofthe its characters anbd performances
. fears
' direction is somewhat stilted
,
and yhe script is sometimes a little too
(
and this isnt a owrd i
' m beginning to hate tothe uise
but alas i must
) quirky for its own good
( i think i
' ll blame tath onthe scott rosenberg
, who judging from what he did wtih beautiful girls
, con air
,
and things tothe do in denver while your dead
, has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits of this movie
)
.
but cusack really does deserve an award
, for being so damn
?
?
? cusackian
. i
' m afraid that his talents are so understated thta he may have tothe wait till his hip needs replacing to be offred such an award worthy ofthe his considerable talent
. his character
, rob
( whose sort of liek an older
, more bitter lloyd ffrom say anytying
) is funny
and tragic without bieng pathetic
,
and that cusack cant do all this
, adn still not imprint himself onto tghe minds of most audiences
, is something of an achievement
.
