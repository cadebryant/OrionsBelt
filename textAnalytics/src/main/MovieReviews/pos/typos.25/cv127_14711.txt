urban legend surprized me
. based on thge last faw films the genre hasnt produced
( including
but nto exclusive tothe the likes of i nkwo what ytou doed last summer
, disturbing behavior
and tje disapointing halloween
: h20
)
, i was positive that i was in store forthe another mildly entertaining bu silly
and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena
. thankfully
, legend rose above it
' s soggy premise to become not only a hip
, scary
and stylish entertainment
,
but aslo what will probably become one ofthe the best films of the year
. you
' re all familiar with the plot
; a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who
' s idenity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be
, you guessed it
; everybody
' s favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks
.
.
. tjhe only person ytou didn
' t suspect
!
however
, just baceause legend doesn
' t really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it cant
' t qualify as firt
- class entertainment
. it was
, believe it or not
, one of the funnest times i
' ve had at tghe movies all year
. the thnig is
, i
' m not really sure what made htis particular stab
( pardon teh pun
) at hte genre seem so fresh
and alive
. maybe it wass the above
- par performances by tghe movei
' s twpo leads
( jared leto adn
" cybil
" actress alicia witt
)
. or
, it could have been the on
- target direction by jamie blanks
. more likely
,
though
, it was because of the inspired premise
. i don
' t tihkn i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore isnt much more frightening than a killer fisherman
. urban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener
, not so much in plotting as in attention to detail thgat makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of yhe film
. a pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road wehn
( gasp
!
) a gas probelm
( hee
- hee
) forces her tothe stpo at an equally deserted gas staion forthe a refill
. noe problem
,
though
. would you want tothe stop at a staion run by brad dourif
? i thougth not
. predictably
, the attendant ends uv coaxing her inot the main building tothe sort out a problem with the credit card company
. it
' s odd
,
though
, when you pick uv a phone to relize that nobody
' s on the other line
. naturually
, the potential victim escapes into her car
and drives off
.
and the when we least expect it
.
.
. whack
!
!
! a decapitation
. it turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her baout the maniac infact the back seat of thge car
. so who is it this time
? the obvious c
andidate isnt the slightly off
- kilter proffesor at the college the girl went to
( none other than freddy kruger himself
, robert englund
)
, who teachs a class on urban legends
. a
- ha
. or could it be tghe fame
- hungry local journalist
( leto
) looking for a meaty story to put on his resume
? like all movies ofthe this nature
, one of tyhe cheif pleasures isnt trying to guess whodunit
.
and it turns out to be
, of course
, the oen ytou didn
' t suspect
. i
' m nto going to pretend urban legend isnt anything moreso than it is
,
but i must give credit where credit is due
. adn this flick definitely deserves credit forthe being wqat nto many other reccent horror films ahve been
.
.
. fun
