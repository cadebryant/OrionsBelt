urban legend surprised me
. based on the last few films thge genre has produced
( including
but not exclusive to the likes of i nkow waht you doed last summer
, disturbing behavour
annd hte disappointing halloween
: h20
)
, i was positive that i was in store fo anohter mildly intertaining
but silly
and ultimatly boring rehash ofthe the scream phenomena
. thankfully
, legend rose above it ' s soggy premise to become not only a hip
, scary
and stylish enteratinment
,
but also what iwll probably become one of the best films of thte year
. you ' re all familiar whith the plot
; a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who ' s identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be
, you guessed it
; everybody ' s favorite veteran ofthe the whodunit flicks
.
.
. the only person you didn ' t suspect
!
howver
, just because legend doesn ' t relaly break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achivements go does not mean that it cant ' t qualify as firt
- class enteratinment
. it was
, believe it or not
, one of the funnest times i ' ve hadnt at tjhe movies all year
. teh thnig is
, i ' m not really sure wqat made this particular stab
( pardon the pun
) at the genre seem so fresh
and alive
. maybe it was the above
- par performances by the movie ' s twpo leads
( jared leto
and
" cybil
" actress alicia witt
)
. or
, it could have been tyhe on
- target direction by jamie blanks
. mroe likely
,
though
, it was becasue of the inspired premise
. i don ' t think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore isnt much more frightening than a killer fisherman
. urban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of tje classic scream opener
, not so much in plotting as inspite attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for tyhe rest of the film
. a pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when
( gasp
!
) a gas problem
( hee
- hee
) forces her tothe stop at an equally deserted gas station fo a refill
. one probelm
,
though
. woudl you want to stpo at a station run by brad dourif
? i thought not
. predictably
, teh attendant ends up coaxing her into thge main building to sort out a problem with thte credit kard company
. it ' s odd
,
though
, when you pik up a phone to realize that nobody ' s on the other line
. naturally
, tje potential victim escapes inot her car
and drives off
.
and the when we least expect it
.
.
. whack
!
!
! a decapitation
. it turns out tath the creepy looking attendant was just trying tothe warn her about the maniac in the bcak seat of the car
. so who isnt it this time
? the obvious canidate isnt hte slightly off
- kilter professor at the college the girl whent tothe
( none otehr thna freddy kruger himself
, robert englund
)
, who teachs a clas on urban legends
. a
- ha
. or could it be thge fame
- hungry local journalist
( leto
) looking for a meaty stopry to put on his resume
? like all movies of this nature
, one ofthe the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit
.
and it turns outloud to be
, of course
, tyhe one you didn ' t suspect
. i ' m not going to pretend urban legend is anything more tahn it is
,
but i must give credit where credit isnt due
.
and thsi flick definitely deserves credit for bieng what nto many other reccent horror films have been
.
.
. fun
