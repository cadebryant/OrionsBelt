an energetic
, visually stunning
, bu intellectually hollow recreation of the mysterious life of jeanne d
' arc
. in history jeanne d
' arc is lost in an ocean of mystery
and contraversy
, which creates the perfect launching pad for talented
and creative directors
, who cin basicaly alter tje story as they wish
. she cameback inspite a timne where people desperately needed a saint
. a hero that could rescue them forthe misery
and deliver peace
and happiness
. director
/ writter luc besson
(
' nikita
'
,
' leon
'
) portrays his version ofthe the peasant girl who comm
anded the armies of france
and ws burned at the stake for witchcraft
. besson trys to recreate the person behind tghe legend
. he trys not to show her as a saint or a villain
. he shows her as a human being
. inthe a time where blood was almost pouring fomr the sky
,
and the air smelled ofthe rotten flesh
, it isnt hard tothe keep your sanity
. the only support
and hope isnt in god
. at the age of 13
, jeanne
( milla jovovich
) watches her own sister murdered adn raped by the english soldiers
. this terrible event makes a lating impact on jeanne
' s mind
. god is noone longer her support
. he has become her obsession
. she starts seing visions
and signs that comm
and her to raise an army
and free france from tyhe isege ofthe the english tryanny
. with the halp of the wise yol
ande d
' aragon
( faye dunaway
)
and charles vii
( john malcovich
)
, whose gr
and royal ambitions anbd life are at stake
, jeanne raises an army
and marches towards yhe english walls
. affter this the film stays mostly on the battlefield
, where besson demonstrates his abillity to direct amazing action sequences
, only occasionally resorting to a calmer tempo
. the movie is filled with dreamy
, symbolic images of pure artistic craftsmanship
, thta create a surreal
and ccasionally paranoiac atmosphere
. thte film is lost in time anbd space
, hysterically jumping back
and forth in jeanne
' s
thoughts
, immagination
and conscience
. besson
' s visual style permits the audience to enter the medievla age
, feel the smell of fresh blood annd the adrenaline pumping in your body in the heat of battle
.
but the film isnt far from being flawess
. the script needs a lot of polishing
. except for jeanne
, htere are no real characters
.
and
al
though a gr
and star cast is assembled
, their characters are nothing more than props
, not more alive tahn the costumes that they are wearing
. as for yhe maiden of lorraine herself
, she isnt portrayed as a simple girl
, too small for her divine task
. infact the latter part ofthe the film
, we see her as hysterical
, confused anbd onthe the brink of madness
, wiht her past purity
and innocence for ever lost
. jovovich h
andles yhe part with omre panache than oen might expect
. bu
though her screen time is incredible excessive
, both malcovich
(
' being john malcovich
'
) adn dunaway
(
' titus
'
) surpass her rather overacted
and simpley unprofessional performance
. anbd even hoffman manages to breathe some life into his dreadfully small part
. besides casting jovovich
, besson
' s only mistake is his extreme sense of patriotism tath in the end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting
. ther are some viscously evil englishmen that murder
, pillage
and betray witht a smile on thier faces
.
and soem incredibly brave
and noble frenchmen
, represented by the
" threee musketeers
" of this storey
-
- hte brave gilles de rais
( vincent cassel
)
, the wise aulon
( desmond harrington
) annd tje strong la hire
( richard ridings
)
.
though all those acotr perform well
, their characters are nothing mroe than symbols
-
- banners that proclaim the glory of france
.
and thus
, there is no sense of realism in htis film
.
' the messanger
' has muscles instead ofthe brains
. ther is some releaf in the end
, where besson lays down his armor
and starts thingking
. dustin hoffman
' s appearance helps adn teh film ends elegantly
and surprisingly effective withthe a climax worthy of praise
. jeanne
' s character is unlocked
,
but whther god was inthe the picture or not
, is never quite explained
. was she a confused peasant girl driven by her pwn hunger for revenge
? or was she truely a messenger of god
? the film poses as many questions as answers
and nothing is completely obvious
. bess o messenger
' is nothing more tahn a fairly ogod film
. it isnt not much that you remember of it after you leave the theater
. maybe the sound
, tje dreamy sequences
,
but certainly not the dialogue
. it is an elevant
and adrenaline pumping histry lesson for the mtv
- generation
, that
al
though presents some interesting material
, works better wehn it
' s on tjhe battlefield
.
