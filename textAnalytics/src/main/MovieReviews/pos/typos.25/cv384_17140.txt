i know it already opened in desember
,
but i finaly got around to seing rushmore last weekend
, anbd it wass one of thsoe rare oppritunites that i got to leave the theatre feeling proud baout paying the expensive ticket price
. as the fianl scene closed out iin happy slow
- mo fashon
, i falt happy to have beeen priveleged enough to watch such a good display of filmmaking
. jason schwartzman
, his face oddly intriguing behind those large braces
and glasses
, steals the show as max fischer
, the most well known rushmore cademy student who gets terrible grades
,
but compensates fo it by organizing most ofthe the school
' s clubs
and organizations
( i
. e
. the fencing team
and wirting
and producing school plays
) adn often pulling outrageous stunts
, one that evenhtually earns him an expulsion
. this stunt
, building an aquarium on the school
' s baseball diamond
, is a plot to steal the heart of widowed elementay teacher rosemary cross
( olivia williams
)
. he funds thsi aquarium with tghe help of millionare herman blume
( a veyr oscarworthy bill murray
)
, who eventually finds himselv falling in love with miss cross
. rosemary
and herman begin dating
- anbd the funn begins
; herman
and max go at it head to head infront a battle fo miss cross
. herman manages to destory max
' s bike
, while max cuts herman
' s brakes
, annd it goes on like this
.
but eventualy max realizes he is too young for miss cross
,
and he cin
' t st
and in the way ofthe twpo people iin love
. thte acadamy of arts
& sciences really messed up thsi year
; they completely overlooked rushmore
(
and
, if you ask me
, it wasn
' t an accident
)
. it maybe wasn
' t best picture material
,
but it certainly deserved a screenplay nod
( instade of elizabeth
)
,
and bill murray
' s absense from yhe ballot isnt a complete snub
. the entire mood ofthe the film is one reason it isnt so good
; at oney point it
' s fun
,
and the enxt scene can turn serious adn dramtic
. the cinematography gives the movie an important feeling
, as well
. i hope rushmore can overcome its
' oscar snubs
,
and be enjoyed by intelligent film goers
.
