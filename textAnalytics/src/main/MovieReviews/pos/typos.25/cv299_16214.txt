expectation rating
: a bit worse thna expeced
( mainly because i found the middle part to be a bit dull
)
. roger ebert gave it a four star review
, annd while he is a critic that uses tyhe full scale
,
and i often agree
-
- such as dark city being tyhe best film of 1998
, he must have seen a better film
. i read the book about five years ago
and hugely enjoyed it
. the oppening of a simple plan reminded me a bit of the sweet hereafter
. the l
andscape isnt snowy
and cold
, annd is filmed what i feel is in a rather crisp manner
( which aslo reminds me of fargo
( which i loathed
)
)
. one cin almost sense the cold
.
but tghe movie far from the eye popping delights of the quick annd thte dead
, instead raimi hasnt made a more constrained film
-
- whic probably is for tghe better
. this is probably not a movie thta would have been improved by lots of odd shots
. the movie also reminded me ofthe affliction
, as the lead characters all seem tothe be hoping for
and seeing a possibility tothe lead a better life than their father
,
and tehy see a chance forthe such a dream to come true
. this chance isnt uncovered in a snow covered field
, where an airplane hasnt crash l
anded
. in the plane threee men fidn
? tghe american dream
.
.
. in a gym bag
.
? affliction too wass set in a snowy l
andscape
. it really seems veyr simple
. just hold on to the money until spring
,
and if noone one claims it
, they
' ll be safe to spend it adn their hope of experiencing the american dream can cmo true
.
but the snow melts
, adn so might several of the character
' s hopes
. as in
? return tothe paradise
?
, some of the characters are presented with a chance to dont the right thing
.
but doing the right thing might nto result in a better result than something more selfish
. the movie
' s biggest strength isnt that it fact makes sense
. i have seen many movies based onthe books that just seem like selected scenes from the book visualized
, eschewing anything remotely resembling a coherent tsory
-
- for example clear
and present danger
. the biggest problem seems to over
- familiarization with the story
. thge writer perhaps feels that he doesn
' t haev to present scenes that are clear to him
, bu the lack ofthe which only baffles an audience which hasnt not read the book
. htis is definitely nto the problem with a simple plan
, even
though the screenplay is by the book
' s author
. the movie is always clear onthe where it
' s going
,
and always makes sense
. i
' m sue a lot was cutted
,
but really i can
' t remember what
. even a minor scene involving a man complaining that he has paid for too much grains is included
. the man only comes inspite on mondays
,
but he claims that he hasnt been charged forthe noe puchase too many
. turns outloud
.
.
. well
, see thge movie
. one should be warned agianst seeing tyhe trailer
. it reveals severeal scenes from tjhe ending moments
( which yes
, like in hte book
, it is a downer
)
, several plot developments
,
and much ofthe the beginning
. bu much of this isnt not spelled directly outloud during the trailer
, so if yuo
' re lucky
, you
' ll have forgotten about all of this when yuo see the movei
.
