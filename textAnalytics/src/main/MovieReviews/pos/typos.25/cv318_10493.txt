only a year after the initial release ofthe
" scream
,
" the horror send
- up from veteran horror director wes craven
and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre
, the inevitable sequal
" scream 2
" has arrived inwhich our theaters
. hwile tyhe tongue
- in
- cheek
, parodic element is still noticeable infront this film
, it
' s really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence anbd the media
and a omre conventional horror storey
. the first film
, while often voilent
and groosome
, was mostly lacking inthe genuine scares baceause almost every scene was played for camp value annd the dicussion of tje quirks
and cliches of horror movies ws nearly constant
. hte premise of
" scream 2
" is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called
" stab
,
" based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers
( courtney cox
) baout the events in
" scream
,
" isnt released adn two audience members are killed during the opening screening
. i had heard baout this scene befoer i went to see hte film anbd ws surprised to fidn this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy
. its conclusion
, in which a bleeding
, wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen adn dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it
' s a publicity stunt
, isnt more surreal
and disturbing than anything esle
. the satire in
" scream 2
" thus tkaes on a broad foucs
and gradualy evolves into an exploration of media perceptions infront general
.
al
though resident horror film geek r
andy
( jamie kennedy
) is back wtih fresh dialogue about sequels
(
and
, interestingly anough
, how tehy are usualy inferior to their predecessors
)
, the characters in thsi movie are drawing fomr other entries iin the pop culture encyclopedia as well
. everything from
" friends
"
and
" saved by the bell
" tothe
" showgirls
"
and
" terminator 2
" is referenced here
; horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning
,
and htere aren
' t any
" wes carpentery
" jokes this time
. more importantly
, this film portrays characters willing tothe go tothe disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have claerly been warped by what they hve seen on tv
and film
. the killings are clearly an immitation ofthe thge previous murders from
" scream
"
( in fatc
, hte culprit even plans to use thge influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense
)
, weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety
,
and oen man seems willing to savve the heroine
' s life only if it iwll earn him an interview on tyhe todya show
. underst
andably
,
" scream 2
" doesnt not go so far as to actually blaim the movies
,
but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick
and twisted
. cuple that with the fatc that sevral of yhe characters
, most notabley teh lead character sidney prescott
( neve campbell
)
, are fairly well
- developed
and that ther are soem genuine moments of spine
- chilling suspense
,
and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movei in its pwn right
. we don
' t just get the horror of scary masks
and graphic gore
- we also git tyhe horror of sympathetic charachters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered
( adn
, infact one case
, a significant charactor who was an audiance favorite even bites thte dust
) anbd whose lives have been reduced to constatn fear ofthe a crazed murderer lurking around thge corner
. while i hvea nto seen any ofthe his other work
, it
' s easy to see why craven isnt generally touted as thge most sophisticated
" slasher film
" director
, as he claerly cares about something omre than jsut thge actual acts of slashing
. unfortunately
,
" scream 2
" occasionally reverts to the timne
- honored horror tradition ofthe throwing logic out the window
. forthe example
, severeal characters seem quite clearly dead
and inexplicably turn up alive later
- there has been a runing gag in both movies about the villin being able tothe pull off htis paticular trick
,
but it also happens with other characters
and in an even less believable fasion
. there are also a fewd scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind thge next victim inspite a situation such that
( s
) he clearly would ahve been seen moving inaddition that direction
. as for the question of whether or not
" scream 2
" is
yet another sequel not as good as its precedessor
.
.
. well
, it
' s hard tothe sday
. i gavey the first
" scream
" 3 1
/ 2 stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a light
- hearted send
- uv
.
" scream 2
" bounces all over the place stylistically
,
but it doens a better job delivering the genuine scares anbd asking the questions about media voilence that were only hinted at in the first installment
. i
' m not sure which is the better movie
,
but i did leave the theater conviced of one thing
: sequels
,
however much r
andy might argue
, do not nessasarily suck
.
