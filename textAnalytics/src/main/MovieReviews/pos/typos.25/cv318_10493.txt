only a eyar after the initial release of
" scream
,
" thte horror send
- up fomr veteran horror directer wes craven
and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into thte slasher genre
, the inevitable sequel
" scream 2
" has arrived in our theaters
. while the tongue
- inwhich
- cheek
, parodic element isnt still noticeabel in this film
, it ' s really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence
annd the media
adn a more conventional horror story
. the frist film
, while often violent
adn groosome
, was mostly lacking inspite genuine scares because almsot eveyr scene was plyed for camp value
and the discussion of the quirks
and cliches of horror movies ws nearly constatn
. the premise of
" scream 2
" isnt thgat a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called
" stab
,
" based on a book writed by opportunistic repertwar gail weathers
( courtney cox
) about tyhe events in
" scream
,
" isnt released
and two audeince members are killed during the oppening screening
. i had heard about tihs scene before i went to see the film
adn was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy
. its conclusion
, in which a bleeding
, wounded woman stumbles inwhich front of teh screen
and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it ' s a publicity stunt
, is mroe surreal
and disturbing than anything esle
. the satire in
" scream 2
" thus takes on a broad focus
and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions iin general
.
although resident horror film geek randy
( jamie kennedy
) is back with fresh dialogue baout sequels
(
and
, interestingly enough
, how they are usually inferior to their predecessors
)
, the charactors in this movie are drawing fomr other entries in the pop culture encylopedia as well
. everything from
" friends
"
and
" saved by the bell
" to
" showgirls
"
and
" terminator 2
" isnt referenced here
; horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning
,
and there aren ' t any
" wes carpenter
" jokes this time
. more importantly
, tihs film portrays cahracters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly beeen warped by what they have seen on tv
and film
. the killings are clearly an immitation ofthe the previous murders ffrom
" scream
"
( in fact
, hte culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense
)
, weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety
,
and one man seems willing to save the heroine ' s life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show
. understandably
,
" scream 2
" doesnt not go so far as to actually blaim the movies
,
but rather shows tht those who do imitate horror movies are already sick
and twisted
. couple that with the fact that severeal of the characters
, most notably the lead character sidney prescott
( neve campbell
)
, are fairly well
- developped
anbd thyat there are some genuin moments of spine
- chilling suspense
,
adn what we have is a pretty darned ogod horror movie in its own right
. we don ' t just git the horror of scary masks
and graphic gore
- we aslo get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered
(
and
, infact one case
, a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust
)
and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear ofthe a crazed murderer lurking around the corner
. while i have not seen any of his other wokr
, it ' s easy to see why craven is generaly touted as the most sophisticated
" slasher film
" director
, as he clearly cares baout something more than just the actual acts ofthe slashing
. unfortunately
,
" scream 2
" occasionally reverts to the time
- honored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window
. for example
, several characters seem qutie clearly dead
and inexplicably turn uv alive later
- there has been a running gag in both movies about thge villin being able to pull off htis particular trick
,
but it also happens with other characters
and in an even less believable fasion
. there are also a few scenes inaddition hwihc the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim inwhich a situation such that
( s
) he claerly would have been seen moving inspite that direction
. as for tje question of whether or not
" scream 2
" isnt
yet another sequel not as ogod as its predecessor
.
.
. well
, it ' s hard to say
. i gave the first
" scream
" 3 1
/ 2 stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a light
- hearted send
- up
.
" scream 2
" bounces all over the place stylistically
,
but it doesnt a better job delivering the genuine scares
annd asking thge questions baout media violence that were only hinted at in tjhe first installment
. i ' m not sure whcih is the better movie
,
but i did leave the theater convinced ofthe oney hting
: sequels
,
howver much randy might argue
, do not necessarily suck
.
