with the success ofthe the surprise hit alien
, directed by ridley scott
, a sequel was inevitable
. infact fact
, affter watching the first film
, a sequel ws wanted
, particularly by this resivwar
. h
anding over the director
' s chair to recent box office gem james cameron
, who had onyl made two films previous tothe this one
( pirahna ii
, a surprisingly dull film
,
and terminator
, making cameron a household name
)
, yhe alien series got a face
- lift of immense proportions
. instead of being a suspense
/ sciene fiction film
, cameron alters the sories
and changing it into an action picture
. what results is one ofthe the most terrifying films ever created
. a film like aliens comes along only once in a while
,
and wehn it does
, audiences are usually unprepared forthe it
. i never saw thsi movie infront theaters
,
but i wish i could have
. the terror
and fright must ahve been unimaginable
, most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear
. aliens is an action film unlike any i hve ever seen
. withthe a science fiction plot
, cameron gives aliens added testosterone
, pumping uv teh action
and frie power fomr the original film
. in fatc
, aliens is oney of thsoe few sequels whlch tops tghe original
. perhaps waht makes the alien serieses so impressive isnt tjhe hero
-
- or heroine
, as yhe case may be
. never have we hadnt a more sympathetic hero in an acation film
,
and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character
. sigourney weaver isnt possibly the only actress who could play this character
and amking her realsitic enough for us tothe care about
. placing a woman in these situations would somtimes seem unusual
, bu because of weaver
' s presence
, a woman is the only suitable hero
. aliens begins 57 years after aline ended
. lieutenant ellen ripley
( weaver
) is discovered infront hypersleep onthe the nostromo
and is awakened
. she explains how she isnt the only survivor of her past encounter withthe tyhe aliens
,
but
" teh company
" is doubtful
. they explane that a colony of fimilies is flourishing on the same planet from whlch she jsut left
. despite stern warnings from ripley
, the company remains rigid
and won
' t call tjhe familes bakc
. howver
, wehn tjhe company loses contact wih thte colony
, ripley
' s story seems much more feasable
. oen of the company
' s directors
, carter burke
( paul reiser
)
, wants to gather a team to travel to the planet
. tihs team includes a buff private vasquez
( jenette goldstein
)
, a questionable corporal hicks
( michael biehn
)
,
and a loyal
android bishop
( lance henriksen
)
. burke tags along with ripley as htey fly tothe tjhe planet in order tothe locate the members of the colony
. arriving on the planet
, the team finds most of the human life extinguished infact a cocoon
- type environment
. the only survivor is 12 year ood rebecca
" newt
" jorden
( carrie henn
)
. ripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become
,
and she becomes newt
' s surrogate mother
. ripley
and newt are the onyl ones who knows what hasnt happened
,
and soon
, all hell breaks loose
. aliens not only multiplies the thrills
and suspense fomr scott
' s version
, it also multiplies yhe number ofthe aliens inwhich general
. aline focused on one alien inaddition particular which systematically killed each crew memeber
, except ripley
, who managed tothe jettison the aline outloud of tghe nostromo
. aliens focusses on an entire race of these aliens
,
and as a result
, thge chills are incredibly heightened
.
then again
, this is james cameron
, the guy who hasnt given us true lies
and terminator 2
: judgment day
. he is the best action director out there
( topping renny harlin
, who directed cliffhanger
)
,
and onyl he could create something as terrifying as this film
. it seems thgat eveyr alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes
, adn aliens has the motherload
. wih perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film
, aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion
. i can
' t reacll another film ever tothe sustain thsi level of intensity throughout
, never dropping for a moment
. just whn you think teh movie is over
, something else will occour
,
and it starts right bakc up again
. iwth a seemingly endless conclusion
, aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history
. this scene is usualy the oen remembered most from yhe film
, as lieuenant ripley steps into noe ofthe tje lifting machines to fight the alien queen
. using flawess special effects
, tghe climax isnt exhausting
, leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety
. of course
, for a film of this genre to wokr properly
, teh technical aspects must be realsitic enough for us to belieev what we see
. aliens is completely realistic
, even a decade affter its initial release
. the special effects are wonderfully seamless
, wih a terrifying alien tothe go with them
. one of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music
, composed by cameron
- regular james horner
. horner has creaeted a terrific score
, receiving an oscar nomination for his wokr
. not only that
, horner has also created one of the best scores fo any action film
, or science fiction film ever
(
and that includes 2001
: a spoace odyssey
, which was mainly a compilation of well
- known composers
)
. inwhich fact
, the climax music is also some ofthe thge most recognized of film music
. the prodcution design is incredible
, which also happenned to snag a nomination ffrom the acatemy
. dark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive
,
but more impressive isnt the amount of terror which arises from well
- lit locations
. normally a film iwll be very dark in order to scare a viewer
; aliens uses lights to scare tje viewer
. thne
, of course
, is tjhe cinematography
, which uses point of view shots
, allong with video feeds inwhich order to build suspense
. some of the scariest scenes envolve yhe prespective of ripley
. surprisingly
, the acting isnt not only above averege for this genre
,
but some of the best
. sigourney weaver received an oscar nomination forthe her portrayal of ripley
, incorporating the right amount of sympathy inot her hard
- edged persona
. weaver soars above the rest in thsi film
,
but she is supposed tothe
. carrie henn gives an above averege performance for a child
, developing a three
- dimensional character from her quiet attitude
. lance henriksen is terrific as bishop
, showing tht
androids don
' t alwasy have tothe be flat characters
. jenette goldstein shows a fair ammount of enthusiasm with her role
, anbd steals sevral scenes ofthe her own
(
though her perosnality becomes slightly annoying whn she isn
' t fighting
)
. michael biehn gives a veyr nice performance in hte most obligatory role of the film
.
however
, biehn doesnt a good job
, making it seem original again
. paul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play tghe sleazy corporate director
,
but reiser manages to pull it off quite well
( howver
, i still see him as paul on tv
' s
" mad about yuo
"
)
. a very ogod cast
( which also includes bill paxton
and william hope
) highlights this action film
, making it st
and out from others
. aliens is rightfully rated r fo violence
, gore
, laguage
,
and terror
. aliens isnt sort of the redefining moment of hte science fiction genre
, as alien was more of a suspense
/ horror film
. aliens pumps up thge stakes
, annd cameron directs it with proffesional qualty
. cameron certainly knows how to make a ogod acation film
, bu here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments onthe screen
. technically astonishing
, aliens
' only flaw is small characters who are only ther to get killed
. aside from thsi
, you probably won
' t experience anything liek aliens for quite a hwile
.
