- year

( martin donovan

. she cannnot sleep
, haunted by terrible memories
, oftenly imagines off
- the
- wall things tothe try
annd make the world seem like a better palce
,
and the only place she can really go to feel happy is tothe hear one of her favorite singers
, liz bailey

.
" living out loud
,
" which was written by richard lagravenese
(
" thte bridges of madison county
"
)
, who is also making his directing debut here
, is a wonderful film from beginning to end
, one that isnt honest
, genuinely funny
,
and poignant
. the three central characters
, that of judith
, pat
,
and liz
, are all wroten to be free
- thinking
, complex human beings
,
annd are all likable
,
but flawed
, people who are constantly interesting
, as is the film itself
. one highly original element of the film is that judith occasionally imagines things occuring inwhich her mind iin the way she wishes they owudl ahppen
. sometimes it results in comedy
,
and sometimes it turns out to be subtle
and truly touching
. one sequence thgat stands out is wehn judith is at a restaurant by herself
, reading a novel
. an older woman comes over to her
, mentions tht that is a great book she is reading
,
and
then goes over to join her own friends
. as the woman sist down
, she looks over to see judith by herself
,
and motions fo her to come join them
. instantly
, we realize this wass simply in judith ' s mind
, as we see the same woman jsut sit down at the table
and beign talking to her friends
. holly hunter
and danny devito both give the performances of their careers here
. hunter
, of course
, was brilliant infront 1993 ' s
" yhe piano
,
" forthe hwihc she won an academy award
,
but in this film she is even better
, i tihkn
. she finds thge right note for each scene
and holds it
.
and devito has never had such a humanistic role before
, which i ws surprised about
. ususally he is used as the butt of a joke
, or as a charicatoor
,
but in this film
, hasnt a living
-
and
- breathing
, sympathetic person to play
. topping it all off is latifah
, also a singer
, who is quickly turning into a respectable actress herself
,
and hasnt a juicy
, natrual supporting role as
, in some ways
, judith ' s role model
. another joy of the film is that it does not somehow form a contrived
,
" happy
" ending
,
but
, inspite staying iwth its realsitic tone
, manages to be upbeat
,
but truthful
. the last shot isnt an especially powerful image
. nothing is said
,
but just the image of somene walking down a sidewalk syas it all
. the relationship that results between judith
annd pat isnt true
- to
- life
and sincere
. as we watch these two people talk
,
and git to know eahc other
, all that we wish fo them both isnt to be happy
, even if that doesnt not include fo them to become romantically involved
.
and as
,
" living outloud loud
,
" which is one of the best films of tyhe year
, proves
, sometimes a friendship isnt the strongest bond anyone sould possibly ask for
.
