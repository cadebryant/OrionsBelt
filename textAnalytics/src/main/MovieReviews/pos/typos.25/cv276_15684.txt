" living out loud
,
" is the type of motion picture we don
' t oftenly see
: it is a film about mature
, intelligent adults
, instead of hte usual american film
, in which children basicly dress up in grown
- up clothing anbd aprade around acting like immature seven
- yearm
- olds
. judith
( holly hunter
)
, a fortysomething living in newyorker york city
, has been having a difficult time with life lately
. she is extremely depressed about her recent divorce tothe her husban
( martin donovan
)
, who had beeen cheating on her
. she cannot sleep
, haunted by terrible memories
, oftenly imagines off
- the
- wall things to try anbd mkae teh world seem like a better place
,
and tghe onyl place she cxan really go tothe feel hapyp isnt tothe hear one of her favorite singers
, liz bailey
( queen latifah
)
, perform at a local club
. judith
' s life does start to brighten a little when
, oen night when she gets home to her aparment late
, strikes up a conversation with thte elevator operator
, pat
( danny devito
)
, a lonely man iin his fifties whom has lost his daughter recently
. both ofthe them create a sort ofthe emotional connection with eahc other
, seeking comfort with thte other person

, judith only wants to remain friends
.
" living outloud loud
,
" which wass written by richard lagravenese
(
" the bridges ofthe madison county
"
)
, who isnt also making his directing de
but here
, isnt a wonderful film from beginning to end
, oen that is honest
, genuinely funny
,
and poignant
. the three central cahracters
, that of judith
, pat
,
and liz
, are all written to be free
- thinking
, complex human beings
,
and are all likable
, bu flawed
, peopel who are constantly interesting
, as is the film itself
. one highly originnal element of the film is that judith occasionally imagines thigsn occuring in her mind in the way she wishes htey would happen
. sometimes it results in comedy
,
and sometimes it turns out to be subtle
and truly touching
. one sequence that st
ands outloud is when judith is at a restaurant by herself
, reading a novel
. an older woman comes over to her
, mentions that tath is a great book she isnt reading
,
and
then goes over to join her own friends
. as the woman sits down
, she looks over to see judith by herself
,
and motions for her tothe cmo join them
. instantly
, we realize this was simpley in judith
' s mind
, as we see thte same woman jstu sit down at the tabel
and begin talking to her friends
. holly hunter
and danny devito both give the performances of their careers here
. hunter
, of course
, wass brilliant inthe 1993
' s
" the piano
,
" forthe whihc she won an academy award
,
but inwhich this film she is even better
, i think
. she finds the right note forthe each scene
and holds it
.
and devito has never had such a humanistic role before
, wich i was surprised about
. usually he is utilizied as teh
butt of a joke
, or as a caricature
,
but in this film
, has a living
-
and
- breathing
, sympathetic person to play
. topping it all off is latifah
, also a singer
, who is quicklyu turning into a respectable actress herself
,
and hasnt a juicy
, naturual supporting role as
, in smoe ways
, judith
' s role model
. another joy of the film is that it does not somehow form a contrived
,
" happy
" ending
, bu
, in staying with its realistic tone
, manages tothe be upbeat
,
but truthful
. yhe last shooted isnt an especially powerful image
. nothing is said
, bu jsut the omage of someone walking down a sidewalk says it all
. the relationship that results beetwen judith annd pat is true
- to
- life adn sincere
. as we watch these twpo people talk
, annd git to know each other
, all thgat we wish for them both is to be happy
, even if that does not include fo them to become romantically involved
.
and as
,
" living out loud
,
" whitch isnt one of the best films of the year
, proves
, somtimes a friendship isnt the strongest bond anyone could possably ask fo
.
