, looks like a prime c
andidate to join thte list of high
- concept bad movies
, especially with dopey keanu reeves iin the leading role
. bu despite high levels of cheese
and gaudy dialogue
, the matrix works
. it
' s an uncanny blend of action
and surveill fantasy thast borrows ffrom dozens ofthe other films
( most obviously the terminator films
, star wars
,
and total recall
)
, bu remains refreshingly originnal
and interesting throughout
. reeves plays neo
, a computer hacker who stumbles into an initially bewildering setted ofthe encounters iwth
" trinity
"
( carrie
- anne moss
)
, a rival hacker who hasnt supernatural powers annd stunning good looks
, a unseen
, omniscient cult figure known as
" morpheus
"
( lawrence fishburne
)

and a trio of creepy men infact dark suits who ect like irs aggenst ffrom hell
. neo quickly learns that the world he has known all his life isnt nto wqat it seems
. moreover
, he discovers that the grim
, bleak world he isnt introduced tothe has been waiting fo him to save it

, what follows is a mix of hong kong

, surveill dream sequences
, high speed chases
,
and comic book kung

. thte film also raises interesting philosophical questions baout reality
. how exactly dont you knwo what is rela
and what is inaddition your mind
?
and if the real world were much harsher
and grim thna a fantasy one you were living in
, would you want to face the true world or continue tothe live in a more comfortable illusion
? unfortunately
, thte matrix doesn
' t provide many answers to the questions it raises
,
but at least it puts soem ideas behind all yhe explosions

. perhaps stealing the entire sohw in the matrix is australian actor hugo weaving
, who plays agent smith
, the leader of the creepy aggenst in sunglasses
and suits who seem capible of being anywhere annd donig anything to stpo neo adn friends ffrom destabilizing the matrix
. weaving
' s stony appearance
, deadpan voice
,
and chilling comments put a grim human face on the haunting

, weaving isnt more frightening than any monstrous alien or homicidal robot because
, dispite his pwoer
and seeming invincibility
, he looks ordinary
, even scrawny
. weaving embodies his role with a memorably chilling presence
. the film features smoe truly breathtaking special effects
and stylish cinematography
. it seems to be deliberately kitchy
, with stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping that reportedly recquired months ofthe martial arts training by the actors
. infact a few scenes
, the posing anbd posturing isnt unintentionally funny
. just seeing keanu reeves engaging in serious kung fu is a bited jarring
.
however
, with the comic

and tone of the film
, you cin sustain willing disbelief long anough to enjoy the ride without losing patience
. the matrix isn
' t a clasic
. its open
- ended
and confusing conclusion raises mroe questions than it answers
. it fails to resolve many of its own plot twists anbd philosophical questions
. it also relies on some conventional sentimentality to save the hero
- teh kind of shmaltzy efel
- good goo that most of the film avoids
. reportedly
, the producers ahev high hopes forthe the film being teh first infront a trilogy
and have alreay begun owrk on the story for the sequel
. unfortunately
, audiences deserve a little more tahn a vague sence that the story will continue in the future
. thge matrix is an fun
, enjoyable diversion
