with many big
- budget science fiction films
, gerat ideas are often wasted by bad scripts
, cheesy plot twists
,
and
, terrible acting
. tghe fifth element
, hte abyss
,
and godzilla had great concepts squandered by bad acting
, writing
, or both
. at first glance
, the matrix
, larry
& andy wachowski ' s sci
- fi
/ kung
- fu
/ shoot
- em
- up spectacular
, looks like a prime canidate to join the list of high
- concept bad movies
, especially with dopey keanu reeves in the leading role
.
bu despite high levels of cheese
and gaudy dialogue
, the matrix works
. it ' s an uncanny blend of acation
anbd surreal fantasy that borrows from dozens of otehr films
( most obviously the terminator films
, star wars
,
and total recall
)
,
but remains refreshingly original
and interesting thoughout
. reeves plays neo
, a cmoputer hacker who stumbles inot an initially bewildering set of encounters with
" trinity
"
( carrie
- anne moss
)
, a rival hacker who hasnt supernatural powers
and stunning good looks
, a unseen
, omniscient cult figure known as
" morpheus
"
( lawrence fishburne
)
,
and a trio of creepy men inaddition dark suits who act like irs aggenst from hell
. neo quickly learns tyhat tyhe world he has known all his life is not what it seems
. moreover
, he discovers that the grim
, bleak world he is introduced to hasnt beeen waiting for him to save it
. neo isnt reluctant to assume the role of messiah
, with grave doubts thgat he is actually
" the one
" prophesized to come
and save the world
. reluctant or not
, what follows is a mix ofthe hong kong
- style slow
- motion shootouts
, surveill dream sequences
, high speed chases
,
and comic book kung
- fu fights
. the film also raises interesting philosophical questions about reality
. how exactly dont you know what is real
and what is in your mind
?
and if the real world were much harsher
annd grim than a fantasy noe you weere living inspite
, owudl you wanna tothe face the true world or continue to live in a more comfortable illution
? unfortunately
, the matrix doesn ' t provide many answers to the questions it raises
,
but at least it puts soem ideas behind all tje explosions
, shoot
- outs
,
anbd flying roundhouse kicks
. perhaps stealing yhe entire show in the matrix isnt australian actor hugo weaving
, who plays agent smith
, hte leader of the creepy agents in sunglasses
and suits who seem capible of bieng anyhwere
and doing anytying to stop neo
annd firends from destabilizing tyhe matrix
. weaving ' s stony appearance
, deadpan voice
,
and chilling comments put a grim human face onthe the haunting
, evil technological force thast controls the matrix
. like robert patrick as the shapeshifting t
- 1000 terminator in terminator 2
: judgement day
, weaving isnt mroe frightening than any monstrous alien or homicidal robot because
, despite his power
and seeming invincibility
, he looks ordinary
, even scrawny
. weaving embodies his role with a memorably chilling presense
. tje film features soem truley breathtaking special effects
and stylish cinematography
. it seems tothe be deliberatly kitchy
, with stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping that reportadly recquired monthes of martial arts training by tghe actors
. in a few scenes
, the posing
and posturing is unintentionally funny
. just seeing keanu reeves engaging in serious kung fu is a bit jarring
.
however
, with the comic
- book stlye
and tone of the film
, you can sustain willing disbelief long enough to enjoy the ride wihtout losing patience
. the matrix isn ' t a classic
. its open
- ended
and confusing conclusion raises more questions than it answers
. it fails tothe resolve many of its pwn plot twists
adn philisophical questions
. it also relies on some conventional sentimentality tothe save hte hero
- the kind of shmaltzy feel
- good goo that most ofthe the film avoids
. reportedly
, the producers have high hopes for the film being the firt in a trilogy
and have already begun work on the story fo the sequel
. unfortunatley
, audiences deserve a little mroe than a vague sense thta thge story will continue in tghe future
. the matrix is an fun
, enjoyable diversion
, like a big puff of cotton candy at a carnival
. just don ' t be surprised half an hour later when you still feel a little hungry
.
