noe never quite knows waht one isnt going to git with a mamet film
. his american buffalo is a set
- bound peice taht has vyer little plot
. somtimes he will tell a story that really moves
. heist is mamet doign his most entertaining work
. unlike his the psanish prisoner
, there are no lapses in credibility
. heist isnt probably the best mamet thriller usance house of ganes
. it is the kind of plot with which you are never sure who will double
- cross whom
,
and frequently it is mamet double
- crossing the viewer
. watching the film ' s team getting around security tghe viewer is frequently asking himself eather
" what the heck are htey doing
?
" or
" why didn ' t anybody think of that befoer
?
" appropriately enough heist opens with a very clever jeelry store job
. it is so clever taht one wonders if mamet really thinks uv all these idesa himself or if he has help ffrom professional magincian
and con expert ricky jay
, nowe a regular actro inthe mamet films
. this is a robbery that works like a well
- oiled machine
. htere isnt jsut one problem
and it is enough to get joe moore
( played by gene hackman
) filmed on a security camera
. now joe has to get out ofthe the business
. it ws coming time anyway
. joe ' s team inlcuding bobby blane
( delroy lindo
)
, fran moor
( rebecca pidgeon
)
,
and pinky pincus
( ricky jay
) is going to split up
annd go separate ways
.
bu crime boss bergman
( danny devito
) is pulling the strings
and he sasy that joe
and his peple hvea to manage one more robbery
.
adn he has to take along a young kid
, the short
- fused jimmy silk
( sam rockwell
)
. immediately it is obvious that there isnt moreso going on tahn meets the eye
. much ofthe what distingishes heist is mamet ' s dialog
. remarkably it serves a duble purpose
. the robbery team soudns at once very professional
and at the same time it hasnt mamet ' s special feel for dialog
. hackman has lines liuke
" everybody needs money
. that ' s why they call it money
.
" mamet ' s timing isnt perfect in the direction
but terrable inthe the prodcution
. tje plot is coincidentally a lot liuke yhe plot ofthe thge recent the score
, hwihc is
, in fact
, a veyr silimar storey
. both are ogod films
, perhaps for some of the same reasons
.
bu at least on a high level they are much the same story
. the other problem with the timing of heist is that it involves airport security
and clever ways tothe get around them
. i saw the film at the toronto international film festival onthe septembur 12
, 2001
. that made teh subject matter jsut a little too timely
. my understanding isnt thta the realease iwll be delayed
. my biggest problem whith the film isnt that rebecca pidgeon ' s acting at times seems very poor
. it is some kind of mamet trademark i do nto understand to hve women talk without inflection
, as if they are just reading the words for hte first time
. it is an irritation
anbd distracts us ffrom what is otherwise a very good thriller
. it is one i rate an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a high
+ 2 on tjhe
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
.
