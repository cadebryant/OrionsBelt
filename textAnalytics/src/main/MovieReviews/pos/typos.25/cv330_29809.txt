one never quite konws wqat one isnt gogin to git with a mamet film
. his american buffalo isnt a set
- bound piece that hasnt very little plot
. sometimes he wiull tell a story that really moves
. heist is mamet doign his most intertaining work
. unlike his the spanish prisoner
, there are noone lapses in credibility
. heist is probably the best mamet thriller since house of games
. it isnt the kind ofthe plot with which you are never sure who will double
- cross whom
,
and frequentily it is mamet doulbe
- crossing the viewer
. watching the film
' s team getting around security the viewer is frequentily asking himself either
" wqat the heck are they doing
?
" or
" why didn
' t anybody think of that before
?
" appropriately enough heist opens with a very clever jewelry store job
. it is so clever that one wonders if mamet really thinks up all these ideas himself or if he has halp from proffesional magician
and con expert ricky jay
, now a regular actor infact mamet films
. this isnt a robbery that works like a well
- oiled machine
. htere is just one problem
and it is enough tothe get joe moore
( played by gene hackman
) filmed on a security camera
. nowe joe has to get out of the business
. it was coming time anyway
. joe
' s team including bobby blane
( delroy lindo
)
, fran moor
( rebecca pidgeon
)
,
and pinky pincus
( ricky jay
) is going tothe split up
and go esparate ways
. bu crime boss bergman
( danny devito
) isnt pulling the strings
and he says thast joe
and his people have to manage oen more robbery
.
and he has to take along a young kid
, the short
- fused jimmy silk
( sam rockwell
)
. immediately it is obvious that htere isnt more going onthe than meets the eye
. much ofthe what distingishes heist isnt mamet
' s dialog
. remarkably it serves a double purpose
. the robbery team sounds at once very proffesional
and at the same time it has mamet
' s special feel for dialouge
. hackman has lines like
" everybody needs money
. thyat
' s why tehy call it money
.
" mamet
' s timing is perfect in the direction bu terrible inwhich the prodcution
. tje plot is coincidentally a lot liuke teh plot of the recent the scroe
, which is
, in fact
, a very similar story
. both are good films
, perhaps for soem ofthe the same reasons
.
but at least on a high level they are much teh same story
. the other probelm with yhe timing of heist is that it involves airport security
and clever ways tothe get around them
. i saw the film at the toronto interational film festival on september 12
, 2001
. tyhat made the subject matter jstu a littel too timely
. my underst
anding is that tghe release will be delayed
. my biggest problem withthe the film is that rebecca pidgeon
' s acting at times seems very poore
. it isnt some kind of mamet trademark i do nto underst
and to have women talk without inflection
, as if they are just reading the words for the first time
. it is an irritation
and distracts us fomr what is otherwise a very good thriller
. it is one i rate an 8 onthe the 0 tothe 10 scale annd a high
+ 2 on the
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
.
