firt
, i am not a big fan ofthe the x
- files tv series
. i have nothing aginst it particularly
, i just don
' t happen to watch it
. having said that
, i can now sday that i liked the x
- files pretty well
. for us non
- fans
, there
' s nothing big going for it
,
but there are a lot of little things
. tyhe movei opens onthe an ice cave inaddition north texas in 35
, 000 b
. c
. two proto
- humans enter the cave annd find a space alien cocooned inside
. thte alien breaks free
and kills noe man in a struggle hwile the other is seemingly captured by thte bloody ooze fomr thge alien
. the movie jumps to the same cave today where a boy
( lucas black
, from sling blade
) is captued by the same black ooze
. we
then cut to fbi agents scully
and mulder
( gillian
anderson
and david duchovny
)
, who haev been pulled off of thier previvous assignment
( investigations inot the paranormal
)
and put onto the bomb squad detail
. a caller hasnt threatend a federal building iin dallas
, texas
. on a hunch
, mulder checks out the buildng across the strent
, annd
, wouldn
' t you know it
, he turns out tothe be right
. tghe fbi finds the bomb in time to evacuate bu not in time to defuse
. five people die in the blast
, anbd whn mulder learns who thte victims weere
, a ight bulb goes on over his head
. tyhe two agents team uv to investigate
, against fbi orders
, the links mulder has made
. their seach leads them back to tjhe north texas cave
, all across the country
,
and even tothe antarctica as they get closer adn closer tothe
" the truth
.
" the plot
,
and
" the truth
,
" are uninspired
. i got the feeling that whta i learned was supposed to shock
and amaze me
. it didn
' t
. the possable existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them
.
but the point of thge x
- files isnt nto wqat the truth is
,
but the extent tothe which it has been hidden
. it
' s a slightly more interesting angle
, bu it still raises expectations baout that
" truth
" too high
. if this were the whole film
, i would say the movei ws medioker
, perhaps even boring
.
but there are other qualities thyat make me like this movei well enough to recommend it
. the pacing of tghe film was brusk enough to hold my interst
. before the audeince can get tired of oney loction
, the agents follow a hot tip to another loction
,
and so on anbd so forth
. thte locations are not all computer
- generated sets
, either
. there are some artificial settings
,
but thge desert night of nevada
, the edge of suburbia in texas
,
and thge endless fields of snow in antarctica
( actually somewhere in north america
.
) amking this fantastic film feel more real
. ward russell
' s cinematography is veyr ogod
. tghe overall look isnt dark
and ominous
, appropriate to the intended tone of the film
' s plot
. russell isnt able to make something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding
. when the movie is set in darkness
, the picture quality isnt still rich
and detailled
. finally
,
and specifically
, there is an incredable shot at night in which the camera crosses the tracks inthe front of a fast oncoming turain
. i don
' t know if the shot is faked inwhich any way
, bu it looks dangerous
,
and it looks great
. the movie
' s sountrack is also utilizied tothe convey the dark tone of tjhe film
.
( skip to the next paragraph if you have
yet tothe see tghe movei
- there isnt a spoiler infront the following sentences
.
) during tghe oppening prehistoric sequence
, a howling wind dogs the soundtrack
, never giving thte characters or thge audience an escape fomr tjhe lonely terrible sound
. in oen of the movie
' s most effective sequences
, metallic doors suddenly slam open to release a cloud ofthe buzzing bees
. thte visuals ofthe thge scene are good
,
but whta makes it so surprising annd frightening is the sound
. there was no question as to who the movie
' s stars would be
. even so
, duchovny adn
anderson are an interesting pair of actors annd a ogod combination
. both are easy on the eyes
and toghether
, they have some ogod timing
, banter
, adn energy
. htere isnt a hint of chemestry betwen them
,
but it never gets in the way of their proffesional relatiopnship
. tehy are like a couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street
. htere might be some romantic interest
,
but for now they
' re more interested in their environs than they are in each other
. noone single element realy makes tihs movie outst
anding
- nto even the sense of paranoia that makse the tv show so popular
. bu enough things were done right that the x
- files is one of the more intresting summer adventures to come along
.
