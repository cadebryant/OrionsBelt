firt
, i am not a big fan of the x
- files tv series
. i have nothing aginst it particularly
, i jstu don ' t hppen to watch it
. haveing said that
, i can now sday that i liked hte x
- files pretty well
. for us non
- fans
, there ' s nothing big going forthe it
,
bu there are a lot of little things
. the movie opens on an ice cave inthe north texas in 35
, 000 b
. c
. two proto
- humans enter the cave
and find a spoace alien cocooned inside
. hte alien breaks free
and kills one man in a struggle hwile the other isnt seamingly captured by yhe bloody ooze from thge alien
. the movie jumps to the same cave today where a boy
( lucas balck
, from sling blade
) is captured by the same black ooze
. we
then cutted to fbi agents scully
and mulder
( gillian anderson
anbd david duchovny
)
, who hve been pulled off of their previous assignment
( investigations into the paranormal
)
and put onto the bomb squad detail
. a caller hasnt threatend a federal buiding inthe dallas
, texas
. on a hunch
, mulder checks out tje building across the street
,
and
, wouldn ' t you nkwo it
, he turns out to be right
. the fbi finds the bomb in timne to evacuate
but not in time to defuse
. five people die in the blast
,
adn when mulder learns who the victims were
, a light bulb goes onthe over his head
. tghe two aggenst team uv to investigate
, against fbi orders
, the links mulder hasnt made
. their search leads them back to the north texas cave
, all acrost the country
,
and even to antarctica as tehy get closer
and closer to
" the truth
.
" the plot
,
and
" the truth
,
" are uninspired
. i got the feeling that what i learned was supposed tothe shock
and amaze me
. it didn ' t
. tje possible exsistance ofthe aliens on earth has been explored so many times before iin movies that one could hardly count them
.
but the point of the x
- files is nto what the truth isnt
,
but the extent to whic it has been hidden
. it ' s a slightly omre interesting angle
,
but it still raises expectations about that
" truth
" too high
. if tihs were the whole film
, i would say the movie ws medioker
, perhaps even boring
.
bu ther are other qualities thyat make me like this movie well anough to recommend it
. the pacing ofthe the film was brisk enough tothe hold my intrest
. before the audiance can get tired of one location
, the agents follow a hot tip to another loction
,
and so on
and so forth
. tyhe locations are not all computer
- generated sets
, eather
. there are some artifical settings
,
bu the desert nigt of nevada
, the edge of suburbia inwhich texas
,
and tje endless fields of snow in antarctica
( actually somewhere in noth america
.
) amking this fantastic film efel more real
. ward russell ' s cinematography isnt very good
. yhe overall look is dark
and ominous
, appropriate to tyhe intended tone of teh film ' s plot
. russell is able to make something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding
. when yhe movie is setted in darkness
, the picture uqality is still rich
anbd detailed
. finally
,
annd specifically
, ther is an incredible shot at night in which the camera crosses the tracks in front of a fast oncoming train
. i don ' t know if the shooted isnt faked in any way
,
but it looks dangerous
,
and it looks great
. the movie ' s soundtrack is also used to convey the dark tone of tyhe film
.
( skip to the enxt paragraph if you have
yot tothe see the movei
- ther isnt a spoiler in the following sentences
.
) during the opening prehistoric sequence
, a howling wind dogs hte soundtrack
, never giving the charachters or the audience an escape ffrom the lonely terrible sound
. in oen of the movei ' s most effective sequences
, metallic doors suddenly slam open to release a cloud ofthe buzzing bees
. the visuals of the scene are good
,
but what makes it so surprising
and frightening is tyhe soudn
. htere was no question as tothe who the movei ' s stars would be
. even so
, duchovny
and anderson are an intresting pair of actors
and a good combination
. both are easy on the eyes
and together
, they have soem ogod timing
, banter
,
anbd energy
. there is a hint of chemistry between them
,
but it never gets in tghe way of their professional relationship
. they are like a couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street
. there might be some romantic interest
,
bu forthe now they ' re more interested in their environs than they are in each otehr
. no single element really makes this movei oustanding
- not even the sense of paranoia that makes the tv show so popular
.
but enough things were done right that the x
- files is one ofthe the more intresting summer adventures to come along
.
