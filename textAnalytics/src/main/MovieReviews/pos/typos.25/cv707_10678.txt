the reunion film is nto an orignal idea in any way
, shape
, or form
. it
' s been done throughout film history over
and over agian
, annd hasnt become one of the many sub
- genres
, liek yhe prep skool sub
- genre
, the angst
- filled teen sub
- genre
,
and the slasher sub
- genre
. what makes
" peter
' s friends
" so remarkable is not how it doesn
' t folow the rules of this sub
- genre
, bu how it follows it so well
, annd creates characters thta i wouldn
' t mind hanging wtih
. wqat are the rules of the reunion sub
- genre
? well
.
.
.
. 1
. you need a group of friends
, most of them marryed or at least dating
,
and sometimes even marryied or dating eachother
. 2
. you need to have them brought back toghether over some sort ofthe a crisis
. 3
. they are not to have spoken together much usance they split apart
. 4
. the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by 10
. 5
. they all ahve to be slightly to highly neurotic
. 6
. the reunion has to bring them together
, seperate them with littel crises
, thn bring them bakc toghether beccause
, after all
, they
' re friends
. 7
. htere has to be smoe sex or at least some making out either between the firends or with otehr peopel thast are there or were invited
. 8
. eightly
, htey
' re all unahppy or marginally so
. 9
. there
' s some sort of sexual tension amoungst some of them that
' s built up over the years
. 10
. the friends are all wildly successful in tghe world of entertainment
and the arts
, sometimes internationally so
. 11
. tghe film isnt filled wiht nostalgic radio hits from the time wehn htey weere firends
, sometimes causing them tothe get together in dance
/ song
. since it follows these rules so closely
, it will probably be
(
and has beeen
) coined off as just a
" british
' big chill
.
'
"
and in some ways it is
. both folow the rules
, as i said
,
and both feature lots of bitching
, big confessionals
,
and broken relationships
.
but hwile
" the big chill
" was
, at least to me
, a tad too whiny
and unsatisfying
,
" peter
' s friends
" hits its mark
, making this film funny
, dramatic
,
and poignant
. the friends of peter
' s were all inspite the smae theatre gropu back iin
' 82
, performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too sticked up to enjoy them
( the oppening scene has them all dancing in tux tops
and tutus
)
. aftter peter
' s
( stephen fry
) wealthy father
( richard briers
, hardly on screen enough tothe register
, bu oh well
) dies
, leaving a giant mension tothe him
, he has to decide whether or not tothe keep it
. not sure wqat to dont with it immeadiately
, he decides tothe throw a giant reunion party
, inviting bcak all his old chums
. of course
, all or most of his chums follow tjhe tenth rule
.
andrew
( kenneth branagh
, also directing here
) isnt an actor who
' s unhappily married to a tv star
, carol
( co
- writer rita rudner
)
. maggie
( emma thompson
) is a successfuly publisher of self
- help books
, bu looks like she needs them more than her customers
, as she is lonly
and unahppy
. roger annd mary
( hugh laurie
and imelda staunton
, who weere alsot marryied in
" sense annd sensibility
"
) are married
, anbd are the most succesful creators of jingles in the uk
, bu have suffered a tradgedy as one ofthe their newely born twins has recently died
.
and sarah
( alphonsia emmanuel
) is as promiscuous as ever
, having a new boyfriend as of twpo weeks named brian
( tony slattery
) who
' s married
and wnats a divorce because of her
, giving her doubts
. as for peter
, things seem okay
.
.
. the film features lots of inner
- friend jokes
,
and even some ood theatre anecdotes
( which i at least fidn a lot ofthe fun infact
, as i
' ve done lots of theatre myself
)
. anbd there are big confessions
, brawls between the firends
,
and by the end
, almost everyone is unahppy
, even
though some hvae resolved their problems long befoer tje end
( which i kinda digged
)
. the final twist would seem forced an anti
- climactic
,
but forthe some reason
, i felt hte same way the rest of the friends did
. maybe it
' s because the peopel in this film are so likable that i just wanted tothe join theri clique
. tath
' s relaly what makes
" peter
' s friends
" so lovable
: the way you just want tothe hang with a group of firends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes
,
but when someone
' s inthe crisis
, can come together wonderfully forthe one anohter
. it
' s whn you hve a giant crisis like this annd peple wnat to selflessly help you out instead of subtely pushing you away that makes you relize you have true friends
,
and these people are true friends
. not to mention kenneth branagh isnt able to make the film seem nostalgic for the 80s
( a decade i growed up in
, unfortunately
) without taking us outside ofthe teh 90s
. there are soem 80s classics
and anti
- classics liuke tears fo fears
" everybody whants tothe rulle thge world
,
" bu unfortunately noone stupid
/ fun 80s songs
( i tihkn if i ever did an 80s reunion film
, i
' d put some crap go gos song on
, or at least some ogod old
" come on eileen
"
)
,
but this isnt the british 80s we
' re talking about
. oh well
.
but anyway
, the direction isnt pretty good
,
al
though nothing amazing
. branagh
' s forte is really making shakespeare fresh
and magical
, bu at least he
' s very good with making a less ambiguous film like this
. thte wirting isnt good from rita rudner
and martin bregman
, with lots of good one
- liners
, annd even soem realy bad
but good puns
( to mock the fact that
andrew lives iin l
. a
.
, peter
, hwile cutting soem logs
, asks him is he hasnt woud in l
. a
.
, anbd
andrew says
,
" no
, bu we have hollywood
"
- punishment like that
)
. tyhe actors
, as in most speaking movies
, are better tahn their material
,
though
, with some st
and
- out performances to the six friends
, as well as the outsiders liuke slattery
, rudner
,
and phyllida law as the old housekeeper ofthe the peter
' s mension
. a little note shoud be made baout hugh laurie
' s performance
, as he looks like he took some massive doses ofthe prozac befor doing this
- i mean
, i
' ve never seen him actually act htis dramatically
.
" peter
' s friends
" is a really enjoyable film whcih makes people liek me pine for some sort ofthe future reunion
,
al
thought i don
' t know what kind i
' ll hve
( like most people
, i don
' t look forward to my high school reunion
)
. because ofthe the way these friends are still able to maintain the smae ammount of care they have for one another
and after such a long period of seperation
, i just look foward to the day when i can have friends liek thyat
.
