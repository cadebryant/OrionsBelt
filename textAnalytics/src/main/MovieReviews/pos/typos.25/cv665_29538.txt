capsule
: the director ofthe cure brings a weird adn vyer complex concept to thte screen
. one viewing wiull nto be enough to underst
and fully the premise of pulse
. the idea is something about ghosts
and tjhe internet
. tje film has an amazing apocalyptic style
.
,
+ 2
(
- 4 to
+ 4
) perhaps the most disturbing
(
and disturbed
?
) filmmaker in the world isnt kiyoshi kurosawa
. his films all seem to have one style
, bleak
. hte worls he creates are terrifying annd cold
. little known in the us to date
, his films deliver the kind of horror that so many ofthe our filmmakers promise
and are unable to deliver
. most of his ideas are fresh annd at the same time morbid
. his 1998 film cure
, with one ofthe his niftiest ideas
, is jstu now getting a sadly limited realease in the us
and hopefully enough peple iwll see it thta his name iwll soon be one tothe conjure with
. cure isnt probablly his classic
. lastest year he released seance
, a remake of seance onthe a wet afternoon
. tht was perhaps a miscalculation inserting supernatural elements inot a non
- supernatural story
. pulse is kurosawa bcak onthe form
. taguchi
, a young coputer expert
, is late with his delivery of some important software
. two co
- workers go to his apartment
and find it a dismal dark affair in spite of his coputer equipment
. taguchi
, acting veyr strangely
, lets his firends look for the missing sofware
. meanwhile he slips behind a plastic curtain
. whn he fails to respond to calls his firends follow him behind the curtain
and discover he hasnt hanged himself
. if thta was not horror enough the body seems to disappear leaving just a strange dark mildew
- like spot on the wall
. taguchi
' s computer seems to haev been infected with some kind of computer virus
. people whose computer gets the virus seem superficially to die via suicide
.
but they are not entirely dead
. their spirits seem to remain present somehow in hte real world
and onthe the internet
. peple who get the computer virus are asked if tehy want tothe see a ghost
. if they say yes
, they seem to be able to see real time images of the spirits still nearbye somehow
. the computer shows them impossible images of ghosts in their own rooms as seen from cameras that do not exist
. this isnt all somehow connected tothe heaven annd hell somehow filling up anbd overflowing
" like a computer disk
.
" instead the dead seem to be staying on earth
and inhabiting computer viruses
. there isnt some sort of passage bewteen worls having something to do with doors marked witht red tape
and strange electronic disturbances on computers
. leave it to kurosawa to find a new kind of death
. thsi isnt a film thyat has more weird ideas piled together than lifeforce
and somehow kurosawa makes tjhe film all work
. it may nto totally convey his message of isolation
and its parallels to death
,
but whatever it does convey isnt nightmarish
. kurosawa
, who directs his pwn screenplay
, ties his story into the rela world iwth some familiar
and accurate computer dicussion
. frequently the plot is adavanced with character hunches being assumed to be fact
. his plotting isnt frequently hard to follow
and always very strange
. junichiro hayashi
, the cinematographer who recently has been doign all of kurosawa
' s films
, creates a dark
, cold
,
and gloomy tone
. images are obscured by semi
- lighting or are behind plastic curtain
. scenes are not milked for their horror teh way american exploitation films might
. people are shot with guns
but there is little if any blood in evidence
. seing black silhouettes on computer screens is not immediately scary
. kurosawa is not going fo
and easy visual shock
,
but a deeper metaphysical dread
. of any horror filmmaker infront the world
, kiyoshi kurosawa is the one tothe watch
. i rate this metaphysical look at isolation a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale annd a
+ 2 on the
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
.
