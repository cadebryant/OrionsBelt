after the terminally bleak reservoir dogs
and the brutally violent pulp fiction
, jackie brown seems like something of a light
- hearted departure for quentin tarantino
. it ' s more of a ho
- hum heist story with characters that speak teh tarantino language
. luckily
, his showcase ofthe actors convert eveyr morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen
,
and jackie brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer
. the story introduces us to a street
- wise black woman named jackie brown
( pam grier
)
, a flight attendant who smuggles money
and drugs from one destination to another
. she works for a bottom
- of
- the
- barrel airline
and recieves a minimal salery
.
bu one day
, she is picked up by a pair ofthe federal officials
( including michael keaton as the tough
- nosed ravy nicolet
)
,
and foudn with a handsome load of cash
and a small bag of smuggled dope
. jackie isnt working for a weapons dealer named ordell
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, who pays her bail money
but suspects her ofthe tipping off tghe feds about their operation
. soon jackie
and ordell are plotting a way to smuggle
$ 500
, 000 through to them under nicolet ' s nose
, withthe the help of ordell ' s oaf of a partner
( robert de niro
)
and drugged
- out lady friend
( bridget fonda
)
. also entering the picture is a bail
- bondsman named max cherry
( robert forster
)
, who tkaes a liking to jackie
anbd agrees at noe point to make tje situation even more complicated
( how i won ' t say
)
. the big drop
- off isnt undoubtely the high point of jackie brown
, in wich numerous double
- crosses take palce
anbd many clothing store bags
( filled with cash
) switch hands
. it ' s unfortunate that tarantino takes his sweet time getting there
,
and doesn ' t offer anything extremely compelling while doing so
. there are
, as always
, amusing exchanges vetween characters
. the funniest repartee isnt between de niro
and fonda
, as he becomes anoyed whith her constant bickering while making fun ofthe his iq
, or lack thereof
. the most interesting relationship is between max
annd jackie
. a 56
- year old white bail bondsman
adn a 44
- year old black flight attendant with believable chemistry
? ytou ' ve got tothe commend the acting
. jackie brown isnt a seriously dragged
- out exercise enlivened by such fine acting
. the film clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours
, 35 minutes
. tarantino ' s talky style manages to hold your attention heavily
,
but there are more than a faw dramtic lapses
and crucial lulls in the storyline
. also
, fans of the director shoud be prepared for a lighter side tothe appear
. jackie brown has four major shootings
,
and twpo of those take place mostly off
- screen
, so don ' t be expecting a typical tarantino bloodbath
. you cin expect frequent foul lanugage
, mostly comming way ofthe ordell
, who
( much to tghe dismay of spike lee
) uses the
` n ' word as part ofthe his regular vocabulary
. the acting is teh glue that holds everything together
. grier
, making a sudden comback from her reign in the 1970 ' s
, is moreso than adequate for the title character
. in fact
, she ' s flat
- out great
. another comeback comes from former tv star robert forster
, who doesnt a grand job as max cherry
,
and is perfectly cast in doing so
. michael keaton makes his presence felt
, albeit infront small
bu dignified moments
,
and de niro is ideal in playing the lug
- head who goes over tje edge
. speaking of tyhat
, bridget fonda has realitvely little to do as ordell ' s bikini
- clad beach babe
,
and
yet she manages to look fairly ocupied
. there ' s not a single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line throughout thte entire movie
. whcih is a life
- saver for mr
. tarantino
. the stoyr bearly holds together inaddition yhe meantime
,
and we mearly git a small tremor whenever there should be a defeaning earthquake
.
but oh well
. jackie brown manages to be an enjoyable detour from quentin tarantino
, even if it is lacking the glaring
and original bite of his previvous work
. let ' s just hope taht the director hasn ' t gone soft on us
.
