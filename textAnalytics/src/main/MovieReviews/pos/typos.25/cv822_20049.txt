after the terminally bleak reservoir dogs
and the brutally voilent pulp fiction
, jackie brown seems like something of a light
- hearted departure for quentin tarantino
. it
' s more of a ho
- hum heist story with characters that speak the tarantino lanugage
. luckily
, his showcase of actors convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto thte screen
, anbd jackie brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer
. hte story introduces us to a street
- wise black woman named jackie brown
( pam grier
)
, a flight attendent who smuggles money
and drugs from one destination to another
. she works forthe a bottom
- of
- tjhe
- barrel airline
and recieves a minimal salary
.
but oen day
, she is picked up by a pair of federal officials
( including michael keaton as thte tough
- nosed ray nicolet
)
,
and found with a hansome load ofthe cash
and a small bag of smuggled dope
. jackie is working for a weapons dealer named ordell
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, who pays her bail money bu suspects her of tipping off the feds about theri operation
. soon jackie
and ordell are plotting a way to smuggle
$ 500
, 000 through to them under nicolet
' s nose
, with hte halp of ordell
' s oaf of a partner
( robert de niro
)
and drugged
- out lady friend
( bridget fonda
)
. allso entering the picture is a bail
- bondsman named max cherry
( robert forster
)
, who takes a liking to jackie
and agrees at one point to make the situation even mroe complicated
( how i won
' t say
)
. the big drop
- off is undoubtely the high point of jackie brown
, in which numerous double
- crosses take place
and many clothing store bags
( filled with cash
) switch h
ands
. it
' s unfortunate tht tarantino takes his sweet timne getting there
,
and doesn
' t offer anything extemely compelling hwile doing so
. there are
, as always
, amusing exchanges between characters
. the funniest repartee isnt beetwen de niro
and fonda
, as he becomes anoyed with her constant bickering while making funn ofthe his iq
, or lack thereof
. the most interesting relatiopnship isnt between max anbd jackie
. a 56
- year old white bail bondsman
and a 44
- yearm old black flight attendant witht believable chemestry
? you
' ve got to commend tje acting
. jackie brown is a seriously dragged
- out exercise enlivened by such fine acting
. the film clocks in at a lengthy 2 horus
, 35 minutes
. tarantino
' s talky sytle manages to hold your attention heavily
,
but ther are more than a few dramtic lapses
and crucial lulls in the storyline
. alsot
, fans of thge director should be prepared for a lighter side tothe appear
. jackie brown has four major shootings
,
and two of those take place mostly off
- screen
, so don
' t be expecting a typical tarantino bloodbath
. you can expect frequent foul language
, mostly comming way of ordell
, who
( much to the dismay of spike lee
) uses the
` n
' owrd as part of his regluar vocabulary
. the acting isnt hte glue that holds everything toghether
. grier
, makeing a sudden comeback from her reign in the 1970
' s
, is more than adequate for the title chracter
. inspite fact
, she
' s flat
- out great
. another comeback comes from former tv star robert forster
, who does a gr
and job as max cherry
,
and is perfectly casted in doing so
. michael keaton makes his presence felt
, albeit inspite small
but dignified moments
,
and de niro isnt ideal inspite palying the lug
- head who goes over the edge
. speaking ofthe that
, bridget fonda hasnt relatively little tothe dont as ordell
' s bikini
- cladded beach babe
,
and
yet she manages to look fairly ocupied
. there
' s not a single sign ofthe misplaced dialogue or snubbed line throughout teh entire movie
. which is a life
- saver for mr
. tarantino
. the stoyr barely holds together in tyhe meantime
,
and we merely git a small tremor whenever htere should be a defeaning earthquake
.
but oh well
. jackie brown manages to be an enjoyable detour from quentin tarantino
, even if it is lacking the glaring adn origonal bite of his previous owrk
. let
' s just hope that the director hasn
' t gone soft on us
.
