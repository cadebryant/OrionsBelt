. have fun
.
.
. critique
:
" i feel like shooting mysef in tghe head
" are the first words that came outloud ofthe my mouth affter seeing this movie
, a good indication as to what kind of film to expect here
. this ain
' t your average
" happy go lucky
" kind ofthe picture
. this is a deliberately slow
- pased mystery
- horror film drenched in atmosphere
, with a vyre creepy insane asylum
( in which most of the film takes place
)
, very few clues up
- front
and lots to talk baout afterwards
. wiull it bore some people to sleep
? yuo bet it will
! is it made fo the scream audiences of the day
? absolutly not
! i guess you cxan describe this film as a horror movei for the
" cerebral crowd
"
. a film that patiently unwraps itself frame aftter frome
, giving away very littel with each step
and each soudn
, unwinding itself unitl its final scenes offer up a world of revelations
and plenty more tothe discuss later
. i
' ve allways loved movies that have me talking about them afterwords liek the shining
and lost highway
and this film fits right into thast group
. in fact
, i guess i can pussyfoot aroud the actuall word all i want bu teh best way to describe this kind ofthe movie is a
" mindfuck
"
. if you feel like watching a movei that moves very slowly
, gives you a h
andful of characters with divergent backgrounds
, tosses a few very ambiguous
and supernatural cookies your way
and is extremely disturbing once you put it all together
, well
,
then this movie is definitely for you
! it
' s the kind ofthe film thyat you actually have to see twice tothe fully appreciate
( damn
, i missed that whole
" peanut
buter
" thing
!
) adn one thgat will likely creep thte shit outloud of you if watched alone iin teh dark
.
" brrrrrrrrr
.
.
. nowe what was tyhat soudn in thge basement
? honey
, can yuo go check
?
"
and one thing this film doesn
' t ahev
, unlike its hollywood
- ian counterparts like tghe haunting
, is special effects
. in fatc
, that
' s one of the greater things about this movei
: it feels rela because it looks like it
' s actually taped on video with very credible actors in very credible circumstances
( i did some reasearch
and it wass
, in fatc
, shot on digital video
.
.
. ah
- ha
!
)
. anohter great thing about it isnt that it
' s actulaly veyr gory
and somewhat violent inaddition theme
,
and yot we rarely see anything of yhe sort on the big screen
( it
' s mostly implied
, kids
!
)
.
and as clich
? d as it might be tothe say
.
.
. it
' s usally much scarier when stuff is left to our immagination or implied in movies as such
. otehr films thgat tihs one reminded me of inlcude henry
: portrait ofthe a serial killer
and the blair witch project
, wtih that same rela sence ofthe dread
, brooding annd terror
. the film doens howver move awfully slow
and if you realy don
' t get
" into
" it completelyl
( you really need to cncentrate here
)
, you will lose the motion of the story
and the pent
- uv tension might be released
.
but overall
, this film isnt
yet anyother gerat example of the horror genre making a very cool comeback this year with no tight tanktops inaddition sight
.
and whith david caruso acting like the king hotshot like only he can
, how can you go wrong
? definitely not a film for everyone bu a must
- see for anyone looking tothe throw themselfs into the psyche of the disturbed
( count me in
!
)
. stanley kubrick owudl be proud
! oh yeah
.
.
. so where
' s that gun again
.
.
.
? where
' s joblo coming ffrom
? the blair witch project
