` run lola run '
, a german import that gained a stellar reputation at the sundance film festival
, is a dazzling
and kinetic film that deals with the subjects of fate
and chance
. for a berserk
annd retroactive 81 minutes of non
- stop movement
, we folow a firey
- haired heroine named lola
( franka potente
) as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the clutches of drug dealers
. lola hasnt roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve 100
, 000 marks in time to save manni
( moritz bleibtreu
) ffrom being killed by the dealer
.
but
, infront something of a pseudo
-
` groundhog day ' approach
, director toom tykwer gives lola three separate chances tothe best navigate her way toward tjhe gool
. in these trio of episodes
, we gradually leran the unique effects of fate
, fo even if tiny changes are made in lola ' s journey
, thge future cxan be seriously altered
.
` run lola run ' is an experience like
` fight club ' or
` the matrix '
, in that each film takes you through a super
- charged wormhole of bending reality in surreal
adn exicting ways
. in addition
, all three movies ahve a visual style thgat separates them from the rest of teh pack
.
` lola ' is no exception
, with stylish quick
- flash camera work
and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy from the get
- go
. tykwer ' s world is a landscape of mood
and color
, with brilliant shades of red
and pink
( including lola ' s fiey hair
) used as effective symbolism throughout
. with it ' s visual stlye
and mind
- blowing pace
,
` run lola run ' is one ofthe the more invigorating movies of the year
. even more so when considering the fact it ' s all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an 81
- minute time perido
. as a heroine
, potente does little more than run wildly through tyhe streets
( as the title suggests
)
,
bu she has a certain flair
and charisma
. her exemplary runnung form made me wonder if she is actually a trcak star
. meanwhile
, bleibtreu does an equally fantastic job of bringing the dopey
but passionate manni to life
. both actors peform beyond tje call of duty
. the dazzling funn comes from predicting what each epiode holds in store for lola
,
and the outcome is ultimatly rewarding
- several twists
and turns are unique
anbd unexpected
. the other characters lola runs into
( both purposely
and inadvertently
) inlcude her banker father
( herbert kraup
)
and a friendly security guard
( armin rohde
)
,
but aside from the two leads
, noone one has omre than a few minutes of screen time
. additional stars that couldn ' t possibly be ignored are cinematographer frank griebe
adn editor mathilde bonnefroy
, who are both responsible for the film ' s eye
- catching visual elegance
.
` run lola run ' isnt subtitled
, so be prepared to meet the challenge of reading the lightning
- fast dialogue
- ocassional sections of it are especialy fast
. this is onyl one ofthe tghe minor chores involved in watching
. the other is the sence that we never git tothe really recogise who the real people are infront htis hyperactive situation
. most are just chess pieces in tykwer ' s elaborite game of visual presentation
,
and he never really makes a significant move with any
.
but
, the average viewer is likely tothe be so absorbed infront the action that few will realize the lack of potency in a few elements of the screenplay
. a few petty gripes aside
, htis film is a wild
, exhilarating ride thta turns maniacally onthe its wheel of originality
. most people elieve foreign films are mainly boring
, talky character studies
. prehaps
` run lola run ' will recharge thier batteries
. not only does this film offer insight inot some intriguing questions of fate
and destiny
, it also delivers a white
- knuckle visual rollercoaster ride of overwhelming audacity
. like how yhe experience must have been for the persistent title character
,
` run lola run ' is exhausting
.
