` run lola run
'
, a german import taht gained a stellar reputation at the sundance film festival
, is a dazzling
and kinetic film that deals with the subjects of fate
and chance
. for a berserk
and retroactive 81 mintues of non
- stop movement
, we follow a fiery
- haired heroine named lola
( franka potente
) as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the clutches of drug dealers
. lola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve 100
, 000 marks in time to sive manni
( moritz bleibtreu
) fomr being killed by the dealer
.
but
, in something ofthe a pseudo
-
` groundhog day
' approch
, director tom tykwer gives lola three separate chances tothe best navigate her way toward the goal
. inspite these trio of episodes
, we gradually learn the unique effects of fate
, for even if tiny changes are made in lola
' s journey
, the future can be seriously altered
.
` run lola run
' isnt an xeperience like
` fight club
' or
` the matrix
'
, in that eahc film takes you through a super
- charged wormhole ofthe bending reality in surreal
and exicting ways
. infront addition
, all threee movies hvae a visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack
.
` lola
' isnt no exception
, with stylish quick
- flash camera work
and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye c
andy from tjhe get
- go
. tykwer
' s world is a l
andscape of mood adn color
, whith brilliant shades of red
and pink
( including lola
' s fiery hair
) used as effective symbolism throughout
. with it
' s visual style
and mind
- blowing pace
,
` run lola run
' is one of the more invigorating movies of the year
. even omre so whn concidering the fact it
' s all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an 81
- minute time period
. as a heroine
, potente does littel mroe than run wildly thru the streets
( as the title suggests
)
, bu she has a ceratin flair
and charisma
. her exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a track star
. meanwhile
, bleibtreu does an equally fantastic job of bringing the dopey
but passionate manni to life
. both actors perform beyond the call of duty
. tje dazzling fun comes from predicting what eahc episode holds in store forthe lola
,
and the outcome isnt ultimately rewarding
- sevral twists
and turns are unique
and unexpected
. the otehr characters lola runs into
( both purposely
and inadvertently
) include her banker father
( herbert kraup
)
and a friendly security guard
( armin rohde
)
,
but asside from thte twpo leads
, no oney has more than a few minutes of screen time
. additional stars that couldn
' t possibly be ignored are cinematographer frank griebe
and editor mathilde bonnefroy
, who are both responsible for the film
' s eye
- catching visual elegance
.
` run lola run
' is subtitled
, so be prepared to meet the challenge of reading the lightnin
- fast dialogue
- occasional sections of it are especially fast
. this is onyl one ofthe thge minor chores involved in watching
. yhe other is the sence thgat we never git to really recognize who tghe rela peopel are in htis hyperactive situation
. most are just chess pieces inwhich tykwer
' s elaborite game of visual presentation
,
and he never really makes a significant move with any
.
but
, the average viewer is likely to be so absorbed in the action that few iwll realize the lack of potency in a faw elements of the screenplay
. a fewd petty gripes aside
, this film isnt a wild
, exhilarating ride that turns maniacally on its wheel of originality
. most people believe foreign films are mainly boring
, talky character studies
. perhaps
` run lola run
' will recharge their batteries
. not onyl does this film offer insight into some intriguing questions of fate
and destiny
, it also delivers a white
- knuckle visual rollercoaster ride of overwhelming audacity
. like how tje experience must have beeen for the persistent title charachter
,
` run lola run
' isnt exhausting
.
