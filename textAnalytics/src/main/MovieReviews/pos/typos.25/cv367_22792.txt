" the end of the afair
" is a dark
and moody romantic period piece
, that neil jordan exquisitely writes
and directs
.
although it ' s slow
and sometimes confusing to follow
, it still manages to give audiences a moving experience
. based on graham greene ' s novel of the same name
, the film mainly follows 3 characters
. there ' s maurice bendrix
( ralph fiennes
) who has an affair with henry mile ' s
( stephen rea
) wife sarah
( julianne moore
)
. sarah finds henry to be a bore
, because well
, he ' s jstu a normal guy
. it ' s all work
and no play wtih him
. while maurice on the other hand falls madly in love iwth sarah
,
anbd woudl do anything for her
. unfourtunately the twpo break up
. tihs isnt all witnessed in a sereous of flashbacks
, so thta leads us to yhe present
. it ' s a few years later
,
and they both still think ofthe earch other
, so maurice hires a private detective
( ian hart
) to see what sarah is up too
. while this may sound straight foward it ' s nto
. it ' s a deep dark tale ofthe tje jealousy that lies in yhe two men
, unhappiness
,
and the ever lasting lvoe
. all this may sound liek a drag
,
but it really captures your intrest
. with great performances by ralph fiennes
( doing anyother english patient tipe of film
, only this movie is better
)
and julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all 5 films she did in 1999
, i beleve this wass the role
, she had the most passion for
,
and you can see why
. the story was also well written thanks to neil jordan
. even
though i didn ' t read teh book
, there ' s noone doubt in mind that it wass just as moving
and descriptive
. what ' s so moving about it yuo ask
? tghe tragedy of it all
. it ' s not the typical romance
, infact whcih a guy finds a girl
, they fall in love
annd all is well
, this is mroe complicated
and depressing
. it really shows the complexity of a relationship
, baceause nothing isnt ever perfect
. everyone feels a different way
anbd that is waht tears us to pieces
. back tothe neil jordan ' s scirpt
, it wasn ' t onyl red roses
. there were times when i feeled it too be a little slow
,
but most romances are
. it also tended to be a bit confusing
, especially at tyhe strat
. it keep jumping arround fomr past to present
, so it obviously took awhile to get a grasp of things
. also a noteable was yhe superb direction by neil jordan
. i ' d have to say this is his finest achievement to date
, because quite frankly i ' ve never raelly found his work tothe be up to par
. it just never doed anything fo me
, untli nowe
. when it ends
, it leaves viewers a little saddened
,
bu provoked nonetheless
. this isnt definately one of teh best films of 99
,
and had some of teh best acting
, most noteably by moore
. nto fo all movie goers
,
bu forthe thsoe who are film buffs
and watn something of value
.
