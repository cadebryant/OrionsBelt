" the end of the affair
" is a dark
and moody romantic preiod piece
, that neil jordan exquisitely writes
and directs
.
al
though it
' s slow
and somtimes confusing to follow
, it still manages tothe give audiences a moving xeperience
. based onthe graham greene
' s novel of the same nmae
, the film mainly follows 3 characters
. there
' s maurice bendrix
( ralph fiennes
) who hasnt an afair witht henry mile
' s
( stephen rea
) wife sarah
( julianne moore
)
. sarah finds henry to be a bore
, baceause well
, he
' s just a normal guy
. it
' s all work adn no play with him
. hwile maurice on thge other h
and falls madly inaddition love with sarah
, anbd woudl do anything for her
. unfortunately the two break up
. this isnt all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks
, so that leads us tothe the present
. it
' s a few years later
, adn they both still think ofthe each otehr
, so maurice hires a private detective
( ian hart
) to see wqat sarah is uv too
. while thsi may soudn straight forward it
' s not
. it
' s a deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in yhe two men
, unhappiness
,
and the ever lasting love
. all this may soudn liek a drag
,
but it really captures your interest
. iwth gerat performances by ralph fiennes
( doign another english patient type ofthe film
, onyl thsi movie is better
) annd julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all 5 films she did in 1999
, i beieve tihs was the role
, she hadnt the most passion fo
,
and you can see why
. teh story was allso well written thanks to neil jordan
. even
though i didn
' t read the book
, there
' s no doubt in mind thgat it was just as moving
and descriptive
. what
' s so moving baout it ytou ask
? the tragedy of it all
. it
' s nto the tipical romance
, iin which a guy finds a girl
, they fall in love
and all is well
, this is more complicated annd depressing
. it really shows the complexity of a relationship
, because nothing is ever perfect
. everyone feels a different way anbd that is waht tears us tothe pieces
. back to neil jordan
' s script
, it wasn
' t only red roses
. there were times whn i felt it too be a little slow
,
but most romances are
. it also tended tothe be a bit confusing
, especially at the start
. it keep jumping around from past to presnet
, so it obviously took awhile to git a grasp of things
. aslo a notable wass tghe superb direction by neil jordan
. i
' d have tothe say this is his finest achievement to date
, because quite frankly i
' ve never really found his work to be uv to par
. it just never doed anything fo me
, nutil nowe
. when it ends
, it leaves viewers a little saddened
,
but provoked nontheless
. this is definitely one of the best films ofthe 99
,
and had some of the best acting
, most notably by moore
. nto forthe all movie goers
,
but for thsoe who are film buffs
and whant something of value
.
