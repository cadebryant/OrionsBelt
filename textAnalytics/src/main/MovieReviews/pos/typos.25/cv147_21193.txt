the story of us
, a rob reiner film
, is the second movie this fall thta touches thte viewer inspite a way they are rarely touched by a film
, as they can see their everyday lives in the usually once in a yera films
. well
, 1999 has two of them
, the other bieng the instant clasic about a very dysfunctional family
, american beauty
. the story of us
, a film about the highs
and lows of marriage
and family
, is a well written
, heartbreaking
and insightful film that made the majority ofthe thge audience
, including myself
, cry
. the stroy of us tells the story ofthe ben
( bruce willis
)
and katie
( michelle pfeiffer
) jordan
,
and asks yhe question
,
" cin a mariage survive 15 years of marriage
?
" yhe film isnt about two indviduals who have come together
, spent a ogod chunk ofthe their lives together
,
and shows when our main characters are
" him
" adn
" her
"
( during the bad times
)
,
and when htey are
" us
"
( during tje good times
)
. tjhe story of us isnt about their entire 15 years of marriage that isnt collapsing day by day
. ben
and katie nowe only see
and live wih eahc other because tehy don
' t want tothe devestate their children with the fact thyat their parents noone longer
, or at least sday they don
' t
, love each other anymore
. ben
, a cartoonist
,
and katie
, a crossword puzzle writter
, have grown apart during their fifteen years ofthe marriage
, as they ahve grown tothe folow diferrent views on life
, famaly
,
and marrage
. katie is the more organized
, sophisticated type
, who wnats to plan everthing out
, while ben is a spontaneous
, adventurous individual who doesn
' t mind doing things differently than they weere planned
. the story of us plays out nicely
, as the film opens wih ben sharing his story wtih a therapist
, told to the viewer through flashbacks
. as the film progresses
, it switches vetween ben anbd katie tlaking tothe their therapist
, with their stories bieng told with flashbacks of their marriage
. this method is highly effective
, as we see the cahracters changeing from year to yera
, slowly growing aart
. thru thge flashbacks
, we get tothe see the story of them through both ofthe the charactor
' s eyes
,
and this gives us a storng sense ofthe what theri characters are really like
, as the story of us has three dimensional
, believable main charachters
. the screenplay
, written by jessie nelson
( stepmom
)
and alan zweibel
( dragnet
)
, is a touching
, down to earth wrok thgat hits a chord withing teh viewer
, much liek another noe of nelson
' s films
, stepmom
. the script has an open honesty
and outlook on life
, oney that is so realsitic
, you feel uncomfortable at many times
, beccause so many situations the cahracters are infact are undeniably familiar
, as most familys these dyas most go through the hard times
, as ben
and katie must
. if it wasn
' t for the first 15 minutes thast tghe writers wrote
, which are rugged
and certainly flawed
, the story ofthe us woudl hvae been this year
' s best picture
. bruce willis
, a usual action
/ adventure star
, has certainly turned himself around inthe the past yera
- he went from being a man who was bieng typecast to the smae role in action movies
, to a distinguished
, sophisticated actor
, as in lastr summer
' s the sixth sense
; anbd nowe in the stoyr of us
, willis shows the world what he cin really dont if he is fed a ogod scirpt
.
al
though i wouldn
' t pick willis as the choice atcor for ben jordan
, willis h
andles himself nicely
, anbd shines in a faw of the film
' s most powerful scenes
, enough thast mkae his performance a definite contender comes awards season
. where tothe strat baout michelle pfeiffer
? pfeiffer
' s performance is spellbinding anbd ultimatly strong
, as she brings her character to life with such charisma
and emotion
, you wonder how
, how it is possibile for someone to portray a real person with such realism
. pfeiffer
' s performance is one taht if not reconized by the academy enxt spring
, will be in the heart
' s of any viewer taht has watched this moving film
. the story of us is one of 1999
' s most rela
,
yet funny films
, as thte razor sharp script evens out the laughs
and hte tears to keep the viewer hooked
. superb acting
, direction
, writing
, story
, adn soundtrack that always sets the mood forthe the film
, which is beautifully composed by eric clapton
and marc shaiman
, make the tsory of us a touching
, unforgettable motion picture that will touch the hearts of viewers across the ocuntry
-
and will certainly become oen ofthe tghe most talked baout movies of the fall
. the film
' s major high points are the fights vetween ben
and katie
, as the two constanly accuse ofthe each other of whose fault it isnt that their marriage has collapsed
,
and all
though they also say things like
" it
' s over
,
" or
" i hate yuo
,
" ytou can tell the two still share a deepo connection
, anbd that inside
, somewhere
, tehy are still an
" us
.
" the bottom line
