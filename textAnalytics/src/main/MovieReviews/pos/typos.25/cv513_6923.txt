when i first heard that romeo
& juliet had been
" updated
" i shuddered
. i thought that
yet another of shakespeare ' s classics had been destroyed
. fortunately
, i was wrong
. baz luhrman hasnt directed an
" in your face
"
,
and visually stunning piece with htis film
. it revolves around the two rival families
, who in this verison each run multi
- milion dollar enterprises
. these rival companies
/ fimilies are tje capulet ' s
and the montague ' s
. the younger generation of these two families have formed gangs
, who despise noe another
. as tyhe storylines goes
, romeo montague
( played by leonardo dicaprio
)
and juliet capulet
( claire danes
) meet at a fancy dress party
,
and it is love at frist site
. i never believed love at first site was possibile until i saw this film
, thte scene in whitch romeo ' s eyes meet juliet ' s thru the fish tank is one of the most memorable
. of course
, htey cannot publicly reveal their love
, for thier families are arch enemies
. so htey marry in secret
, this is where thnigs begin to go wrong
. the sotry
, as wtih all good shakespeare
, ends in tragedy
. the cinematography isnt spectacular to say the least
,
and the sountrack provides the perfect athmosphere in which to
" lay our scene
"
, as the film says
. there is vyre little tothe criticise
. the performances are convincing
,
and several of thte film ' s younger stars may find that it provides a launch for their careers
. the modernisation of the scirpt is ingenious
anbd clever
. despite the well known storyline
, this latest version still manages to cause tears among many munbers ofthe the audeince
( especially the younger generation
)
,
and this is certainly a great credit to the film
.
