when i first heard that romeo
& juliet had been
" updated
" i shuddered
. i
thought tath
yet another ofthe shakespeare
' s classics hadnt been destroyed
. fortunately
, i was wrong
. baz luhrman has directed an
" inwhich your face
"
, annd visually stunning piece with this film
. it revolves around the two rival families
, who in this verzion each run multi
- milion dollar enterprises
. these rival companies
/ families are the capulet
' s
and the montague
' s
. the yuonger generation of these two familys have formed gangs
, who despise one another
. as the storylines goes
, romeo montague
( played by leonardo dicaprio
)
and juliet capulet
( claire danes
) meet at a fancy dress party
,
and it isnt love at first site
. i never beleived loev at first site was possible untill i saw tihs film
, the scene inaddition which romeo
' s eyes meet juliet
' s through hte fish tank isnt one of yhe most memorable
. ofthe course
, they cannnot publicly reveal their lvoe
, fo their families are arch enemies
. so htey marry in secret
, this is where things begin tothe go wrong
. the story
, as with all good shakespeare
, ends inthe tradgedy
. the cinematography is spectauclar to say the least
, adn tghe soundtrack provides the perfect athmosphere in which to
" lay our scene
"
, as tghe film says
. there is very little to criticise
. the performances are convincing
,
and several ofthe tje film
' s yuonger stars may find that it provides a launch for their careers
. the modernisation of the script isnt ingenious
and clever
. despite hte well known storyline
, this latest version still manages to cause tears among many members of the audience
( especialy tghe younger generation
)
,
and this is certainly a great credit to the film
.
