usally a movie is about something mroe than a soiled rug
,
bu nto the big lebowski
. the new offering ffrom the creators of 1996 ' s crtical hit fargo
, is to say the least
, wildly entertaining
. originality has always been a strong trait in the coen brother ' s movies
,
annd teh big lebowski is insanely orginial
. it begins oddly enough whn jeff
" tyhe dude
" lebowski
( jeff bridges
) is mistaken for a millioniare
, jeff
" the big
" lebowski
( david huddleston
)
, who ' s wife
, bunny
( tara reid
) owes money all over town
. two goons
, out to collect on bunny ' s debt break into dude ' s house
. tehy attempt tothe collect the money thast bunny owes them
and one of them urinates on his rug
. tyhe next day dude explains his situation to his bowling team
( steve buscemi
& john goodman
, respectively
.
) he is advised to go to tjhe big lebowski
adn git him to pay for the defiled rug
. he does this
,
and shortly after gets tied up in a kidnapping caper
. htis is a extremely funny movie wih lots of belly laugh moments
. the coen brothers have assembled a great cast that play off each other perfectly
. also several great supporting roles
, john turturro as a child molesting bowler named jesus
. the coen ' s script plays off perfectly
and it all goes toghether to make it extremly entertaining
. i doubt tihs movie will be nearly as popular as fargo
,
but its off the wall moments make it so far yhe best of 1998
. if ytou liek anything eles tjhe coen brothers hve done you will lvoe this one
, if not they give this one a try its a little diffrent
.
