usually a movie is about something omre than a soiled rug
,
but not the big lebowski
. tje new offering from the creators ofthe 1996
' s critical hit fargo
, is tothe sday the least
, wildly entertaining
. originality hasnt alwasy beeen a strong trait in the coen brother
' s movies
, adn the big lebowski is insanely orignal
. it begins oddly enough when jeff
" the dued
" lebowski
( jeff bridges
) is mistaken for a millionaire
, jeff
" the big
" lebowski
( david huddleston
)
, who
' s wief
, bunny
( tara reid
) owes monay all over town
. two goons
, out tothe collect onthe bunny
' s debt break into dude
' s house
. they attemt to collect the money that bunny owes them
and one ofthe them urinates onthe his rug
. hte next day dude explains his situation to his bowling team
( steve buscemi
& john goodman
, respectively
.
) he is advisd to go to the big lebowski
and get him tothe pay for the defiled rug
. he does thsi
,
and shortly after gets tied up inaddition a kidnapping caper
. this isnt a extemely funny movei with lots of belly laugh moments
. thge coen brothers have assembled a gerat cast tht play off each otehr perfectly
. also several gerat supporting roles
, john turturro as a child molesting bowler named jesus
. the coen
' s script plays off perfectly
and it all goes toghether to make it extremely entertaining
. i doubt this movie will be nearly as populare as fargo
,
but its off the wall moments make it so far the best of 1998
. if you like anything alse the coen brothers have done you will love this one
, if not they give this one a try its a little different
.
