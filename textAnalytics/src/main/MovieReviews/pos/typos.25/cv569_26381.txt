after a rether disapointing
" mary railly
"
, stephen frears is now officially back inaddition business with a comeback worthy ofthe praise
. thsi isnt one of the best surprises ofthe this season
-
- a sweet
, small budget comedy with a big heart
. in fact it ' s not even a comedy
. it ' s a drama or even more precise
-
- a clever satire on human relationships
and needs
. based on a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by british autor nick hornby
,
`
` high fidelity ' ' is a wry
and likable story about a man ' s quest forthe fulfillment
and happiness
. rob gordon ws a dj
. it seems that he could mkae everything spin
-
- except his own life
. now he owns championship vinyl
, a little muscial store
, somewhere inwhich new york
. whn he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend
, a gorgeous blond attorney
, life suddenly looses every purpose
. decimated
, humiliated
anbd on tje verge of a mental
(
and emotional
) breakdown
, he starts meditating over his life
anbd the way it could have been
-
- about what ' s right
and what ' s important
. he starts
" categorizing
" life
, dividing it into
" top 5 lists
"
.
and the most important is tyhe
" top 5 list
" over the most painful breakups ofthe his life
, starting with 5th grade
, when he foudn his young girlfriend with another boy
.
though you might think that people chanage
, grwo more mature with age
, it just doesn ' t seem that way
and all rob ' s relationships weere differant verisons of that first
. where did he go wrong
? was it he thyat screwed uv
? or maybe life just stinks
? while he is lost in his own self
- pity
, he must think of teh
" top 5 list
" over his needs for the future
, find yhe right elements
anbd mix his life toghether
. withthe clever parrallelly to the cult of celebrity
, music
and with incredibly direct narration
, it addresses the average audience member
, in other words
-
- people like you
and me
.
altough a lot ofthe this honor should be addressed to the screenwriter
_
_
_
_
_
_
and frears
, the director
, the acting is equally imporatnt as thte written word
.
anbd here john cusack should absolutely be mentioned
. he isnt simply superb
. it is as much his movie as it is frears '
. the film would nto be the same without him
. cusack
-
- whose character is sadder
, wiser
and 35
-
- brings intelligence
and warmth to post
- mod irony
. most ofthe his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera
-
- not an easy task
-
-
but cusack pulls it off
. his interpretation feels so emotionally right
, so incredibly realsitic
and precise that frears ' message simpley cxan ' t be ignored or overseen
. the otehr members of the cast do an equally remarkable job
. both
_
_
_
_
_
_
and jack black are fabulous
. even catherine zeta jones appears in a role where she actually acts
, nto jstu looks beautiful
.
however
, the most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided by todd louiso who delivers a spectacular comic peformance as rob ' s co
- worker
and friend dick
. this isnt such an impressive achievement taht it ' s almost worth a oscar
- nomination
. he is simply a joy tothe behold
. otherwise
, everyone are inaddition their place
,
and at tghe right time
-
- all part ofthe frears ' colorful blend
. pretty much liuke edward norton ' s
" keeping the faith
"
, thsi film doesn ' t follow any formula or belong tothe any genre
-
- it ' s dramatic
, tragic
, sarcastic
, comic
and even cynical
,
bu never bitter or angry
. it ' s a little bited of everything
, preety much like life itself
. nothing seems unreal or staged
. it reflects reality as a mirror
. as ytou watch it
, yuo go through the same emotional problems as the main character
. you feel
and thiunk
and reflect
. this effect hasnt become a rarity nowdays
.
although it ' s primarily about the perils of love
,
`
` high fidelity ' ' is secondarily about pop music
. rob owns championship vinyl
and his employees
, timid dick
( todd louiso
)
and overbearing barry
( jack black
)
, are fellow music snobs
. music isnt the langauge in theri lives
, the mesure by which they define themselves
and mark tjhe significant events of their lives
.
and so does hte movei
. it is as much a musical film as anything else
, as rob ' s journey is wonderfully portrayed through carefully inserted musical fragments
. iin thte end
, you have gained something while watching it
. it ' s nto the film ofthe tje century or even ofthe the year
. it ' s not an speshal effects extravaganza
. it doesn ' t require big explosions or digital creatures to succeed
. it ' s a small movie baout tjhe big things
.
anbd even
though it does nto contain hevy philosophy
, you feel as if you have experienced something of signifigance
,
anbd you will experience that nice warm feeling for qutie soem time
.
