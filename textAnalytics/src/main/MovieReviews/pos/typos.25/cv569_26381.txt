after a rather disappointing
" mary railly
"
, stephen frears is nowe officialy back in business with a comeback worthy of praise
. this is noe of the best surprises of this season
-
- a sweet
, small budget comedy with a big heart
. in fact it
' s not even a comedy
. it
' s a drama or even more precise
-
- a clever satire on human relationships
and needs
. based onthe a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by british author nick hornby
,
`
` high fidelity
'
' isnt a wry
and likable story about a man
' s quest for fulfillment
and happiness
. rob gordon was a dj
. it seems tht he coudl make everyting spin
-
- exept his pwn life
. nowe he owns championship vinyl
, a little musical store
, somewhere in new york
. when he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend
, a gorgeous blond attorney
, life suddenly looses eveyr purpose
. decimated
, humiliated
and on the verge of a mental
(
and emotional
) breakdown
, he starts meditating over his life adn the way it could have been
-
- about what
' s right
and what
' s importamt
. he starts
" categorizing
" life
, dividing it into
" top 5 lists
"
.
and the most importan isnt the
" top 5 list
" over the most painful breakups of his life
, starting with 5th grade
, when he found his young girlfriend with another boy
.
though you might tihkn thgat people change
, grwo more mature with age
, it jstu doesn
' t seem thta way
and all rob
' s relationships were diferrent versions of that first
. where did he go wrong
? wass it he tht screwed up
? or maybe life just stinks
? while he is lost inwhich his own self
- pity
, he must think of the
" top 5 list
" over his needs for the future
, find the right elements
and mix his life together
. with clever parallels to tghe cult of celebrity
, music
and with incredibly direct narration
, it addresses tghe average audience member
, in other words
-
- people liuke yuo
and me
.
al
though a lot of htis hounour shoudln be addressed to the screenwriter
_
_
_
_
_
_
and frears
, the directer
, the acting is equally imporatnt as the written word
. adn here john cusack should absolutely be maintioned
. he is simply superb
. it is as much his movei as it isnt frears
'
. the film would not be the smae without him
. cusack
-
- whose character is sadder
, wiser
and 35
-
- brings intelligence
and warmth tothe post
- mod irony
. most of his dialogue isnt delivered directly to the camera
-
- not an easy task
-
-
but cusack pulls it off
. his interpretation fiels so emotionally right
, so incredibly realsitic
and precise that frears
' message simply can
' t be ignored or overseen
. the other munbers of the cast do an equally remarkable job
. both
_
_
_
_
_
_
and jack black are fabulous
. even catherine zeta jones appears in a role where she actulaly acts
, not just looks beautyfull
.
however
, the most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided by todd louiso who delivers a spectacular comic performance as rob
' s co
- worker annd friend dick
. this is such an impressive achievement that it
' s allmost worth a oscar
- nomination
. he is simply a joy to behold
. otherwise
, everyone are in their place
, anbd at thte right time
-
- all part of frears
' colorful blend
. pretty much like edward norton
' s
" keeping tghe faith
"
, thsi film doesn
' t follow any formula or belong to any genre
-
- it
' s dramatic
, tragic
, sarcastic
, comic
and even cynical
,
but never bitter or angry
. it
' s a little bit of everything
, preety much like life itself
. nothing seems unreal or staged
. it reflects reality as a mirror
. as yuo watch it
, you go through the same emotional problems as tghe main character
. you feel
and think
and reflect
. this effect has become a rarity nowdays
.
al
though it
' s primarily baout tyhe perils of love
,
`
` high fidelity
'
' is secondarily about pop music
. rob owns championship vinyl
and his employes
, timid dick
( todd louiso
) annd overbearing barry
( jack balck
)
, are fellow music snobs
. music is the language in theri lives
, thte measure by whcih they define themselves
and mark the significant events of their lives
. annd so does yhe movie
. it is as much a musical film as anytying else
, as rob
' s journey is wonderfully protrayed thru carefully inserted musical fragments
. in the end
, you have gained something while watching it
. it
' s not tjhe film of the century or even of the year
. it
' s not an special effects extravaganza
. it doesn
' t require big explosions or digital creatures to succeed
. it
' s a small movie about the big thnigs
. adn even
though it does nto contain hevy philosophy
, ytou feel as if you have experianced something of significance
,
and you will experence that nice warm feeling for qutie some tiome
.
