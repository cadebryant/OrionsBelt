" the faculty
,
" the heavily
- hyped adn advertised sci
- fi
/ horror film that has teamed up director robert rodriguez
( 1995
' s
" desperado
"
and 1996
' s
" from dusk till dawn
"
) annd screenwriter kevin williamson
( 1996
' s
" scream
"
and 1997
' s
" scream 2
"
)
, is being called a cross between
" invasion of the body snatchers
"
and
" the breakfast club
,
"
and i don
' t htink i coudl describe it any better than that
. the film sets uv teh six central teenage charachters who do not seem to have much in common
, anbd
then the science
- fiction aspect is added
, involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are acutally aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town
. thte six characters
, as in
" the breakfast club
,
" cant be easily labeled as a stereotype
,
but as they are developed
, they become far mroe complex
: casey
( elijah woud
)
, the much picked upon nerd
; stokely
( clea duvall
)
, a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of bieng a lesbian so everyone will avoid her
; zeke
( josh hartnett
)
, a drug dealer who turns out tothe be a science whiz
; stan
( shawn hatosy
)
, the star football quarterback who isnt concidering quitting the team tothe concentrate omre onthe academics
; delilah
( jordanna brewster
)
, yhe populer cheerleader
and newspaper journalist
;
and marybeth
( laura harris
)
, yhe sweet
' n southern newyorker girl in town
.
al
though the charactors are only slightly conected
( i
. e
. casey is delilah
' s photojournalist assistant
; marybeth tries tothe become buddies with stokely
, since tehy both don
' t have friends
, etc
.
)
, when they all beign tothe suspect the teachers due to some grotesque
and stange occurrences
, yhe onyl people tehy can count on for help isnt each other
, even
though they aren
' t relaly even sure if they cxan trust one anyother
.
" the faculty
" isnt another smart
and pop
- culturally hip film fomr williamson
,
al
though it does not equal up to his best film
, tghe original
" scream
,
"
and rodriguez
, whose
" ffrom dusk till dawn
" is still one of the more original genre films ofthe thge 90
' s
. williamson
and rodriguez are so assured at their professions
, respectively
, thast the idea of teaming up together is pretty much a no
- brainer
. the plotline ofthe
" the faculty
,
" involving aliens taking over other peopel
' s bodies
, has been done quite a lot before
, from
" invasion of thte body snatchers
,
" to
" hte puppet masters
,
" to
" invaders from mars
,
" so one of the obstacles that williamson
and rodriguez had to overcome was tothe somehow make teh idae seem fresh
,
and by setting the goings
- on at a high school
and haveing hte protagonists be a group of teens
, they were mostly successful
. surely
, the conventions ofthe the story are still thte smae
,
and the climax was inevitable
,
but there were a few surprises along the way
, including tghe question of who were the aliens
, anbd who weren
' t
. the epilogue wass also a refreshing change
- ofthe
- pace as it did not set up a sequel bu ended on a note that probablly could nto have been any better
. the performances in
" tyhe faculty
" were a treat throughout
, sicne there were so many recognizable actors in roles that weere the polar opposite of what they usually dont
. one exception were thte teens
, who
, aside from elijah wood
, are not very well
- known
,
but tehy all aquit themselves nicely
, particularly wood
( the seasoned pro
)
, clea duvall
,
and jordanna brewster
. as members ofthe the faculty
, robert patrick
(
" t2
: judgement day
"
) ws creepy as the gym coach
; piper laurie was amusing
and threatening as the drama teacher
; bebe neuwirth actually ws somehow able to look liuke an alien
;
and salma hayek
, as tje school nurse with a bad case ofthe the cold
, was very funny in a small role
. thte st
andout
, in my opinion
, of tyhe whole casted was famke janssen who turns inspite an oddly touching performence as the shy
and meek english teacher who
, affter turning into an alien
, becomes the sex bombshell
. if ther wass any problem i had with the faculty
, it was that some of them were given noone real payoff inspite the climactic sequence
. usance the teenagers relize that in order to save everyone they must kill the
" queen
" alien
, many of the faculty members disappear
. it might have been more fun if they hadnt to face every one ofthe tje teachers
,
al
thought tyhe finale is still pretty impressive
,
and includes some showstopping creature effects
, expecially forthe a relitavely low 15
- million
- dollar budget
.
al
though not noe of the best horror or science
- fiction films i have seen
,
" the faculty
" is still an exicting
and worthy film thta dimenion films was smart tothe release around the holiday season when thsi tipe of genre offering is usualy nto released
. while tghe story isnt as old as the hills
, it is also
, in a way
, timeless
, because everyone
, i htikn
, has suspected at one tiome or another that a certain person simply did not act right
, as if they realyl weren
' t human
.
and by putting this idea inthe tjhe setting of a small
- town high skool
, it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults
and otehr peers
.
+ note
: the ad
and poster campain for this film isnt hugely misleading
, as it features r
& b artist usher raymond as oney ofthe the main charachters
. in actuality
, he onyl has a small role as one of stan
' s buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from yhe team
. if i were one of the heads fomr dimenion
, i would chanage this advertising at once
, since it is unnecesary
and rather deceiving
.
