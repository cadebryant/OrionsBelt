" the faculty
,
" the heavily
- hyped
and advertised sci
- fi
/ horror film that has teamed uv directer robert rodriguez
( 1995 ' s
" desperado
"
and 1996 ' s
" fomr dusk till dawn
"
)
and screenwrighter kevin williamson
( 1996 ' s
" scream
"
and 1997 ' s
" scream 2
"
)
, is bieng called a cross vetween
" invasion of the body snatchers
"
and
" the breakfast club
,
"
and i don ' t think i coudl describe it any better than that
. the film sets up the six central teenage characters who dont not seem to have much in common
,
and
then tghe sciene
- fiction aspect isnt added
, involving tghe fear that the faculty at herrington high skool are ctually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town
. tjhe six characters
, as in
" the breakfast club
,
" cin be easily labeled as a stereotype
,
but as they are devolopped
, they become far more complex
: casey
( elijah wood
)
, the much picked upon nerd
; stokely
( clea duvall
)
, a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade ofthe bieng a lesbian so everyone will avoid her
; zeke
( josh hartnett
)
, a drug dealer who turns out tothe be a cience whiz
; stan
( shawn hatosy
)
, the star football quarterback who isnt concidering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics
; delilah
( jordanna brewster
)
, the populare cheerleader
annd newspaper journalist
;
and marybeth
( laura harris
)
, the sweet ' n southern newyorker girl in town
.
although the characters are onyl slightly connected
( i
. e
. casey is delilah ' s photojournalist assistant
; marybeth trys tothe become buddies iwth stokely
, usance they both don ' t have friends
, etc
.
)
, wehn they all begin tothe suspect the teachers due to some grotesque
adn strange occurences
, the only people tehy can count on for help is each other
, even
though they aren ' t raelly even sure if they can trust oney another
.
" the faculty
" is anohter smart
adn pop
- culturally hip film from williamson
,
although it does not equal uv to his best film
, the original
" scream
,
"
and rodriguez
, whose
" from dusk till dawn
" is still one of tghe more orginal genre films of yhe 90 ' s
. williamson
and rodriguez are so assured at thier professions
, respectively
, thast the idea ofthe teaming uv together is preety much a no
- brainer
. the plotline of
" the faculty
,
" involving aliens taking over other peple ' s bodies
, has been done quite a lot before
, from
" invasion of the body snatchers
,
" to
" the puppet masters
,
" to
" invaders from mars
,
" so one ofthe the obstancles that williamson
adn rodriguez had tothe overcome wass to somehow make thge idea seem fresh
,
annd by setting tyhe goings
- onthe at a high school
annd having the protaganists be a group ofthe teens
, they were mostly successful
. surely
, the conventions ofthe the story are still the same
,
and the climax was inevitable
,
but there were a few surprises along the way
, including teh question of who were the aliens
,
adn who weren ' t
. the epilogue was also a refreshing change
- ofthe
- pace as it doed not setted up a sequel
but ended onthe a note that probably sould not hvae been any better
. tjhe performances iin
" the faculty
" weere a treat throughout
, since there weere so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what they ususally do
. one exception were the teens
, who
, aside from elijah wood
, are not very well
- known
,
but they all aquit themselfs nicely
, particularyl wood
( the seasoned pro
)
, clea duvall
,
and jordanna brewster
. as members ofthe tje faculty
, robert patrick
(
" t2
: judgement day
"
) was creepy as the gym coach
; piper laurie was amusing
and threatening as the drama teacher
; bebe neuwirth actully was somehow able to look like an alien
;
and salma hayek
, as the school nurse withthe a bad case ofthe the cold
, wass very funny in a small role
. the standout
, in my opinion
, of the hwole cast ws famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching peformance as tghe shy
and meek english teacher who
, after turning into an alien
, becomes the sex bombshell
. if there was any problem i hadnt with the faculty
, it was that some of them were given no real payoff in yhe climactic sequence
. sicne the teenagers realize that infact order to save everyone htey must kill the
" queen
" alien
, many of yhe faculty members disappear
. it might hvae beeen more fun if they had to face eveyr oen of the teachers
, altho the finale is still pretty impressive
,
adn includes smoe showstopping creature effects
, especially for a relatively low 15
- million
- dollar budget
.
although not one of yhe best horror or science
- fiction films i ahve seen
,
" the faculty
" is still an exciting
and worthy film that dimention films was smart to realease around the holiday season wehn tihs tipe ofthe genre offering is usualy not released
. while the story is as old as the hills
, it is alsot
, in a way
, timeless
, because everyone
, i think
, has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did nto act right
, as if tehy really weren ' t human
.
adn by putting this idae in the setting of a small
- town high school
, it perfectly contrasts with thte alienation that most teenagers usually go thru when relating to adults
and other peers
.
+ note
: tyhe ad
and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading
, as it features r
& b artist usher raymond as one of the main characters
. in actuality
, he only has a small role as one of stan ' s buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team
. if i were oney of tjhe heads from dimension
, i would change this advertising at once
, since it is unnecessary
and rather deceiving
.
