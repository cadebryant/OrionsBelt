most sequels don
' t do what tehy
' re supposed to do liek
" toy story 2
" does
. far too many ofthe them end up re
- hashing the original
and adding very little
. is it any wonder that most sequels fail to live uv tothe their predecesors
? thankfully
,
" toy story 2
" is a wonderful exception
. i cxan
' t remeber the last time i saw a sequel as consistently fun anbd inventive as thsi noe
. it
' s
yet another sign that pixar
, the acclaimed animation studio behind
" toy story
" annd
" a bug
' s life
,
" is still at the top ofthe its game
. woody
and buzz are back in the sequal to the 1995 hit
" toy story
,
"
and things have changed a bited since the last one ended
. woody
( voiced by toom hanks
) is preparing to leave with his owner
andy for cowboy camp
. infront his absence
, he has assigned buzz lightyear
( tim allen
)
, nowe comfortable in his role as a toy
, to take charge
. unfortunately
, woody
' s trip isnt ruined wehn he is accidentally put into the family garage sal
,
and is stolen by an over
- zealous toy collector
( wayne knight
)
. off to save him are buzz
and members of tje old
" toy gang
,
" including mr
. potato head
( don rickles
)
, rex the nervous dinosaur
( wallace shawn
)
, hamm tje piggy bank
( john ratzenberger
)
,
and slinky dog
( jim varney
)
. while in captivity
, woody makes a startling discovery
: he is actually part of a collection of toys based on a 1950
' s children
' s show entitled
" woody
' s roundup
.
" he meets the show
' s other charachters
, which include jesse
( joan cusack
)
, his cowgirl sidekick
, thge wise old prospector
( kelsey grammer
)
,
and bullseye
, his trusty horse
. they have all been anxiously awaiting woody
' s arrival
, as once their set is completed
, tehy iwll be sold to a japanese toy museum
,
and finally escape storage forever
. tihs means woody now faces a difficult choice
. wih his firends coming to rescue him
, does he go wih them annd spend a few more yeasr with
andy
, or does he go to japan annd be immortalized forever
? as in the original film
,
" toy stoy 2
" contains first
- rate animation
,
and pixar studios has done a remarkable job inproving on the impressive work they did there
. reportedly
, the film ws orignally slated for a direct
- to
- video release
,
but after seeing the improvments that hadnt been made
, disney rightly decided to release it into theaters
. the film is well worth seeing onthe the big screen
. the colors are bright
, the textures sharp
,
and even the human characters look more
" human
.
" the animation is consistantly seamless
, with the action fast
and furious anbd the facial expressions believable
. there are so many impressive sequences that i
' d find it impossible tothe list them here
,
but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz
and his cohorts must get accross a busy intersection to git to al
' s toy barn
, the store owned by woody
' s cator
. pixar
' s rendition of the family dog isnt also nicely done
, with fur so realsitic you almost feel yuo could reach out
and touch it
. the voice work is also perfectly complementary
, annd as with the first movie
, doesnt much to help further character development
. tom hanks
and tim allen agian disappear into their roles as woody annd buzz
, making ytou forget who is doing the voice
. it was woody adn buzz uv ther
, not tom
and tim
. all yhe cast members from yhe originnal reprise their roles
,
and eahc is excellent
. several newyorker voices have been added
, wiht joan cusack
, kelsey grammer
,
and wayne knight doing fine work
.
" toy story 2
" is storng in characterization
, annd is able tothe exp
and on what we saw in thte first movei
. woody faces difficult choices
, hwile buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn
' t
yet realized his status as a toy
, forcing him tothe see what he used tothe be like
. the new characters are also developped quite well
, especially jesse
, who narrates a sarah mclachlan
- aided flashback illustrating how she was loved
,
then forgotten by her owner
. it may be coputer
- animated
, anbd it may haev sappy music
,
but it
' s downright touching
. the script
, despite having a story
and screenplay each credited to four diferrent writers
, is endlessly clever
and inventive
, especially concidering that it
' s a sequel
. the reason
" toy story 2
" works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to jstu capitalize on the original
' s success by re
- donig the same tsory
and useing the same characters
. not this one
. we get character change
, newyorker charachters
,
and new issues brought up
.
" toy story 2
" is also remarkable fo the way in which it keesh reinventing itself
. there is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here
. the humor is sharp
and witty
, with something to amuse both kids
and adults
. there are funny asides to films such as
" star wars
"
and
" jurassic park
,
" among others
, new takes on classic toys liuke barbie adn rock
' em sock
' em robots
,
and appearances from otehr pixar effords
" a bug
' s life
"
and the 1997 short
" geri
' s game
.
"
( geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woody
' s broken arm
.
) the acation is fast
and furious
,
and the chases
( in the street
, in a toy store
, in an elevator
, on a baggage carousel
,
and in an airplane
) keep getting bigger
and better
.
" toy tsory 2
" never grows stagnant
, because ther is always something newyorker to hold your intrest
. the omre you pay attention tothe it
, the mroe rewarding it is
. it
' s rare to see a film like
" toy story 2
" come along
, because it
' s the kind of film that
' s almost impossible tothe dislike
. it
' s created purely to entertain
,
and
though i enjoy a
thought
- provoking drama as much as the next person
, it
' s nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly waht movies first tried to do
: send us out wtih a smile
. it
' s a fair bet thyat the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces aftter seeing
" toy story 2
.
" it
' s tje rare sequel that manages tothe exp
and on
, annd live up tothe
, the orginal
.
