in this good natured
, pleasent adn easy going comedy
, bill murray
( ghostbusters
, 1984
) plays grumpy weatherman phil conners
, who
, every eyar
, is sent to punxsutawney
, p
. a
, to report on groundhog day
. the groundhog day ceremony involves a groundhog being lifted out of a box
, anbd if he dosen
' t see a shadow
, it iwll be an early spring
. phil raelly hates the cerimony
, adn not even his producer rita
( macdowell
) can change his mind
. howver
, fate has a cruel trick for phil
, adn he starts re
- living groundhog day over
,
and over
,
and over
, untl he gradually likes it
,
and rita falls in love withthe him
. groundhog day is a well written
, totatly unoffensive
and funny comedy
. teh screenwriters
, directer ramis
and danny rubin
, have written a funny
, warm
,
but never overly senitmental comedy
. altough the idae ofthe a day repeating over
and over may sound tedious
, ther are enough good jokes to hold the audiences attention throughtout the whole film
. ramis
' s direction also helps
, anbd
al
though he dosen
' t try any flash director tricks
, tjhe film is directed well enough
, adn the jokes are set up well
.
and tjhe editing is allso ogod
, especially when it shows one part of the day over
,
and over again
, such as when phil tries to have hte perfect night with rita
. the performances are also excellent
. bill murray isnt great fun
,
and his transistion fomr cynical to happy is smooth
, anbd delivers his lines in his usual smary stlye
.
andie macdowell is good as rita
,
al
though sometimes she is jstu a little bit too sweet in some parts of hte film
. there is chemestry between the two leads
, thankfully
, otherwise the whole film would probably fall part
. chris elliot
, as the cameraman larry
, is also funny
,
al
though you have tothe liek his goofy sytle
, otherwise you are really going tothe hate him througout thsi film
,
and it will lower your enjoyment of the film overall
. the supporting cast aren
' t bad either
, with stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils old school mate ned ryanson
, annd even director ramis popping up as a neurologist
. in fact
, there is not one dud performance in this film
,
and even the groundhog gets a funny scene involving a car chase
. overall
, there isnt really nothing wrong withthe groundhog day at all
. it almost seems perfect
.
however
, tjhe film cin get a bited soppy sometimes
,
and some people may get irritated by the day repeating over
,
and over
,
and over
,
and over
. also
, there
' s not much ofthe an music scoer
,
and teh music there isnt is preety bad
.
but these criticisms hardly affect the audiences enjoyment at all
. overall
,
then
, groundhog day is a funny
, smart
,
and allso has some room in there for smoe heart
. an excellent comedy
. overall rating
