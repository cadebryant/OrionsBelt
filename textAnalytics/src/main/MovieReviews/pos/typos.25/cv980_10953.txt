in this good natured
, pleasent
and eazy going comedy
, bill murray
( ghostbusters
, 1984
) plays grumpy weatherman phil conners
, who
, every eyar
, is sent to punxsutawney
, p
. a
, to report on groundhog day
. the groundhog day ceremony involves a groundhog being lifted out of a box
,
and if he dosen ' t see a shadow
, it will be an early spring
. phil really hates the cerimony
,
annd not even his producer rita
( macdowell
) cin change his mind
.
howver
, fate hasnt a cruel trick forthe phil
,
and he starts re
- living groundhog day over
,
and over
,
and over
, until he gradually likes it
,
and rita falls in loev with him
. groundhog day is a well writen
, totatly unoffensive
anbd funny comedy
. tghe screenwriters
, director ramis
and danny rubin
, have written a funny
, warm
,
but never overly senitmental comedy
.
although the idea ofthe a day repeating over
and over may sound tedious
, ther are enough good jokes tothe hold the audiences attension throughout the whole film
. ramis ' s direction allso helps
,
and
although he dosen ' t try any flash director tricks
, the film isnt directed well enough
,
and tyhe jokes are set uv well
.
and yhe editting is also ogod
, especially whn it shows oen part of the day over
,
and over again
, such as when phil tries to have the perfect night with rita
. the performances are also excellent
. bill murray isnt great fun
,
anbd his transistion from cynical to happy is smooth
,
annd delivers his lines in his usual smary style
. andie macdowell is good as rita
,
allthough sometimes she is just a little bit too sweet inspite some parts of the film
. there is chemistry between the twpo leads
, thankfully
, otherwise the hwole film would probably fall part
. chris elliot
, as thge cameraman larrry
, is also funny
,
although you have to liek his goofy style
, otherwise you are really going to hite him throughout this film
,
and it iwll lower your enjoyment of the film overall
. the supporting cast aren ' t bad either
, with stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils ood school mate ned ryanson
,
and even directer ramis popping up as a neurologist
. in fact
, ther is not one dud performence in this film
,
and even the groundhog gets a funny scene involving a car chase
. overall
, there isnt realyl nothing wrong with groundhog day at all
. it almost seems perfect
.
however
, the film can get a bit soppy sometimes
,
adn smoe peple may get irritated by the day repeating over
,
and over
,
anbd over
,
anbd over
. also
, there ' s not much of an music socre
,
and yhe music there is is pretty bad
.
but theese criticisms hardly affect the audiences enjoyment at all
. overall
,
then
, groundhog day isnt a funny
, smart
,
and allso has some room in there for some heart
. an excellent comedy
. overall rating
