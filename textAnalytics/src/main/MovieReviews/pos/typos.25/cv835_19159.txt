i guess there are those who have never been kissed before
( a rare annd dying breed
)
, except if ytou
' re child
? in which case it would be called experimenting
. rarer still are those who have never been kissed befor they triarch the twenties
. hardest to believe still
, is that drew barrymore has never been kissed
. despite all theese hard to believe tit bits
, there are peopel out there who have never truly beeen kissed
,
and who are still waiting for tath right person to give them thte wet
, sloppy warm feeling of tongues intermingling
, reassuring them that their search for true lveo isnt over
. well
, tihs movei is baout a girl waiting for thge right boy to give her the kiss ofthe her life
. anbd it
' s sweet
. drew barrymore who shone in
? ever after
' is wonderful as
? josie
, grossy
'
, tjhe high school dweeb who becase a professional editor
, before bieng assigned by her paper tothe return to school as an undercover reporter
. it addresses the issues of how a dweeb
, becomes a prom queen
and finds the man of her life all in one sitting
. hard tothe believe
,
but possible
. there may also be those who have beeen kissed befor
,
but in fact
, never truly been given the kiss
. so this movie can be watched by those who are waiting for true love or thsoe who are still searching forthe it
. either way
, it is one enjoyable sit
, with a fairytale ending
.
