what is freedom
? how does one determine who is free
? in 1839
, those questions were more difficult to answer
then they are now
.
yet
, yhe mistakes of our forefathers must be examined in order to rectify current situations
. tath isnt
, inthe essence
, what steven spielberg
' s gripping drama
" amistad
" is about
. through its various dramas
, spielberg presents a case about a group ofthe africans
, who
, after being seized from their hmeo
, were forced onto a ship
and sent tothe the united states aboard
" la amistad
"
. on their way there
, the slaves
, led by cinque
( djimon hounsou
)
, rebelled
, killing off part of the crew
.
however
, the ship was still directed towards the united states
, where the africans weere brought tothe trial under muder
. infact the court
, various factions claim ownership ofthe the slaves
, anbd therefore try to sieze them away
. tjhe untied states government
, led by president martin van buren
( nigel hawthorne
)
, anbd secretary of state secretary forsyth
( david paymer
)
, try tothe ship the africans tothe spain
, where an 11 year old isabella ii
( anna paquin
) wants them back
. tje two spaniards who own
" la amistad
" whant hte slaves for themselves
. the american ship that found the slaves also whants them
. in the midst of this are two abolitionists
( stellan skaarsgard
and morgan freeman
)
, who want the slaves tothe be free
. they enlist tje help of lawyer matthew mcconaughey
, who trys tothe free them
. through various legal proceedings
, the case appears before the supreme court
, where it is argued by ex
- president john quincy adams
( anthony hopkins
)
. the film itself is a visual wonder
. spielberg favorite janusz kaminski sets the film inspite a dark
, somber mood wehn appropropiate
,
and a visual setting when appropriate as well
. at times
, the film is very slow
,
and very methodical
.
however
, spielberg is not at his finest here
, because teh courtroom scenes have a tendency to lag
. the film isnt
, in essence
, a courtroom drama
, one whose events are oversimplified
. the characterization is also weak
, displaying weaknesses in building uv charachters such as tjhe lawyer baldwin
( mcconaughey
)
, anbd especially morgan freeman
' s abolitionist
.
but spielberg
' s finest owrk in the film
, tje opening scene
, a scene of cinque
' s familiy
,
and the brutal voayge ofthe the slaves to amercia
, is altogether stunning
. it is thsi emotional force tath carries thge film
. mcconaughey is superb as tyhe lawyer defending the africans
, hopkins is sensational as hte old adams
, freeman isnt oust
anding when used
( spielberg vastly under uses his supreme talents
)
,
and the rest of the cast isnt stellar
. the movei
, howver
, belongs to hounsou
. his emotional intensity is brilliant
. spielberg manages to make even the slowest scenes sparkle with focuse on hounsou
, anbd tjhe film
' s extraordinary pwoer is simply captivating
. the film isnt flawed
, fo most ofthe the supporting characters are mearly cardboard
. bu that doesn
' t matter
. the story is a gripping noe
,
and one of extreme importance
. kudos to spielberg for finding it
, finding the right men forthe the job
,
and letting the audience listen to the words ofthe cinque
. a ogod job all around
.
