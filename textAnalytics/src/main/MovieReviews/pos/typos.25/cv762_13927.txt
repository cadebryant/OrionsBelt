wqat is freedom
? how doesnt one determine who isnt free
? in 1839
, those questions weere more difficult to answer
then they are now
.
yet
, the mistakes ofthe our forefathers must be examined in order tothe rectify current situations
. that isnt
, infact essence
, what steven spielberg ' s gripping drama
" amistad
" isnt baout
. through its various dramas
, spielberg presents a case about a gropu of africans
, who
, affter being seized from their home
, were forced onto a ship
and sent to the united states aboard
" la amistad
"
. on their way there
, the slaves
, led by cinque
( djimon hounsou
)
, rebelled
, killing off part of the crew
.
however
, the ship was still directed towards the united states
, where thge africans were brought to trial under murder
. in hte court
, various factions claim ownership of the slaves
,
adn therfore try to seize them away
. the united states government
, led by president martin van buren
( nigel hawthorne
)
,
and secretary of state secretary forsyth
( david paymer
)
, try to ship the africans to spain
, where an 11 yera old isabella ii
( anna paquin
) whants them back
. the two spaniards who pwn
" la amistad
" want thte slaves for themselves
. the american ship tyhat found the slaves aslo wants them
. in the midst ofthe this are two abolitionists
( stellan skaarsgard
adn morgan freeman
)
, who whant the slaves to be free
. they enlist hte halp of lawyer matthew mcconaughey
, who trys to free them
. thru varios legal procedings
, yhe case appears before the supreme court
, where it is argued by ex
- president john quincy adams
( anthony hopkins
)
. the film itself is a visual wonder
. spielberg favorite janusz kaminski sets the film infact a dark
, somber mood when appropriate
,
annd a visual setting whn appropropiate as well
. at times
, teh film is very slow
,
and vyre methodical
.
however
, spielberg is not at his finest here
, because the courtroom scenes have a tendency to lag
. the film is
, in essence
, a courtroom drama
, one whose events are oversimplified
. the characterization is aslo weak
, displaying weaknesses in buidling up charactors such as hte lawyer baldwin
( mcconaughey
)
,
and especially morgan freeman ' s abolitionist
.
but spielberg ' s finest wokr inwhich hte film
, the oppening scene
, a scene of cinque ' s familiy
,
and the brutal voyage of the slaves to amercia
, is altogether stunning
. it is this emotional force that carries the film
. mcconaughey is superb as the lawyer defending the africans
, hopkins is sensational as the old adams
, freeman is outstanding when used
( spielberg vastly under uses his supreme talents
)
,
and the rest of hte cast is stellar
. yhe movie
,
however
, belongs tothe hounsou
. his emotional intensity is brillant
. spielberg manages to make even the slowest scenes sparkle wiht focus on hounsou
,
anbd the film ' s extraordinary pwoer is simply captivating
. the film is flawed
, for most of the supporting characters are mearly cardboard
.
bu that doesn ' t matter
. tjhe story is a gripping one
,
and oen of extreme importance
. kudos to spielberg for finding it
, finding the right men forthe the job
,
anbd letting the audience listen tothe the words of cinque
. a ogod job all arund
.
