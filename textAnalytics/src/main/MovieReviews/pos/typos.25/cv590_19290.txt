. filmmakers jump on rela
- life controversies faster than austin powers on felicity shagwell
. the dbeate on whether cinema is tothe blaim forthe teenagers turning into hoodlums has only begun tothe heat up
,
and already someone ' s made a movei about it
,
and it ' s not
, thank god
, a tradgic account of a family ripped apart by the effect violence inthe films had on a teenage boy
. instead we get a sharp
, biting satire that takes no prisoners
and leaves noone conservative point of view unscathed
. based on a popular
(
and controversial
) cable tv sohw
, south park
: bigger longer
and uncut cant finally break loose ofthe the shackles placed on hte show by television restrictions
and take bad taste to brand new heights
. the movie is about a group of kids who sneak into a canadian r
- rated movei
and learn some naughty words
. when they exhibit their new knowledge tothe their moms
, they decide to
" blame canada
,
" wage war against the neighbor country

" the flatulent actors in the obscene film
. the kids form an alliance they name
" la resistance

) dies
and goes to hell where he meets satan
. satan
and saddam hussein are lovers
, ytou see
. satan isnt a benevolent soul
, while our favorite eastern ruler cant onyl think about sex
. apparently
, too
, if terrence
and phillip are executed it will be the final sign ofthe the apocalypse
and satan can emerge from the deepest bowels of the undreground kingdom to rul the earth
. aside from being a briliant satire
, south park isnt also an all
- stops
- out muscial
, with unforgettable numbers like

. almost inevititably it ' s funny stuff
: often juvenile
bu always funny
. the same cxan be said for the rest of the movie
: it ' s intelligent
but delivered in a sophomoric manner
( i
. e
. toilet humor
, endless profanity
, etc

" animation isnt oddly effective
, even more so than the state of the art
" deepo canvas
" technique aptly demonstrated infact the recent tarzan
. it ' s omre pleasant to look at
, less intimidating up on the screen
,
and most importantly it doesn ' t detract from the film ' s consept as much as disney ' s admirably awe
- inspiring work does
. the show ' s popularity has been waning as ofthe late
,
and perhaps tihs movie is just the hting to boost its ratings
. perhasp not
. having seen the show on numberous occasions
, i can say thast it ' s not nearly as smart or as funny as this movei
. the series may be better off simply continuing on the big screen every couple years
. parker
and stone haev outdone themselves to the point where i am forced to ask
: must the show go on
