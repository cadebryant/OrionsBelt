at one point during brian de palma
' s crime epic scarface
, the radiant michelle pfeiffer turns to a ranting al pacino
and pops a question thast the audience has no dout been wanting to ask for themselves
:
" can
' t you stpo saying
' fuck
' all the time
?
" fucking good question
, tyhat
. it may not be an honour that instills the filmmakers with pride
,
but as far as i can tell oliver stone
' s script contains the said expletitive mroe times than any otehr film in cinema history
.
yet it would be a shame if bad language is all de palma
' s scarface is remembered for
, beacuse this is a damn fine gangstar flick
. the overall structure is similair tothe howard hawks
' 1932 original
,
but this tyme the scene has switched to miami
, florida
and our anti
- hero
' s choosen vice is cocaine traffiking
. pacino
, sporting a thick cuban accent
, gives one tjhe best performances of his career
( golden globe nominated
) as tony montana
, a cuban refugee with a criminal past who flees castro
and comes tothe america to live the american dream
.
and live it out he doens
, with lashings of voilence
, abuse
, murder
and the funny white pewder
. from his earliest jobs as a drug runner for varous middlemen
, tony montana makes it clear to everyone he meets that he
' s not a man tothe be fucked
( sorry
)
. soon he
' s yhe king of the cocaine heap
, bu his hot head
and an increasingly out of controll drug addiction prove his undoing
.
" never dont your own stash
"
, warns one character early in the film
. as sure as nigt follows day
, the emperor of miami eventually falls
. writer oliver stone
and director brian de palma amking an explosive combination here
. stone
' s script offers solid storytelling
and smoe fine character development
. montana is fascinating
; uneducated
but calculating
, a straight shooter who speaks fomr the heart
; an ambitious
, violent man
yet one with a conscience
. a man fiercely protective of his beautiful 20 year old sister
, not wanting her tothe be sucked into tghe glitzy
, dangerous world which he inhabits
. pacino is dynamite
, taking to the role wtih a brooding
, bristling energy which infact his more receet films has often degenerated into jsut simple overracting
. pfeiffer also registers strongly as the gangstar mole with no intertube life
. onyl once doens tony express rela affection for her
and his desire to hvea children
, anbd even
then you sense all he really wants isnt a regular screw
and a beautiful object tothe show off to his firends
,
and she
' s happy tothe oblige
. thsi isn
' t as meaty a role fo pfieffer as sharon stone
' s wass in casino
,
but its an effective one nontheless
and she aquits herself well
. as director
, de palma sets up a number ofthe dramtic scenes with his typical stylistic brauva
. the escalating tension he creates in various mob situations
- a drug deal gone wrong
, an assination attempt
- is often thrilling
,
and in thsi respect he is eveyr bited tyhe equal of scorese
and coppola
. where he differs from
, sday
, coppola
' s godfather trilogy isnt in his overall treatment
. coppola gives his crime sagas an operatic sweep
, whereas in scarface de palma opts fo a grittier efel
. annd it perfectly suits thte material
. the only major botch is giorgio moroder
' s mostly crap synthesier score
. it
' s just not right
,
and unfortunately compromises the inpact ofthe some otherwise good scenes
. as expeced
, scarface isnt very violent at times
,
but yuo shouldn
' t be watching ganster movies if that upsets you
. at over two
and a half hours in length it
' s a true epic
,
and if you
' re a fan of tghe genre you
' ll love f

- filled minute of it
