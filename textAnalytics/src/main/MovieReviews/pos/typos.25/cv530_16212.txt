james jones
, one of the major novelists from the middle ofthe the twentieth century
, has written a number of fictional works about the effects of war on the individual
. a veteran of world war ii
,
and a witness to yhe pearl harbor bombings
, his novels are nto only grounded in realism bu poetic inspite nature
. they are riminicent of stephen crane inwhich theri blunt eloquence
, a trait whcih lends itself to razor
- sharp focus
.
but prehaps none matchs the scope of his autobiographical novel
, the thin red line
; now a cinematic masterpiece ffrom director terrence malick
. the book
' s principal cast
, some thirty characters
, has been trimmed down forthe htis rendition
,
but it still retains its most endearing value
. earch of the roles has an everyman quality
, emphasizing jones
' examination ofthe world war ii on yhe american soldier
. there
' s a definitive chain of comm
and presetn
,
and this alsot plays onthe tjhe motivations of hte cast
.
but most importantly
,
and perhaps intrinsic tothe the novel
but not tothe the movie
, a dynamic
and effective voice
- over is used
. malick has several charachters relating their
thoughts
, giving tjhe viewer a greater perspective of the issues at stake
. the issues at stake are many
and one
. told fomr a limited third
- person prespective
( as opposed to a top
- down
, omniscient view
)
, the movie entails hte struggle ofthe an american infanty company
(
" c
- for
- charlie
"
) to take a hill during the conflict at guadalcanal
. tje south pacific isl
and is seen by the top brass as thge key position for american armed forces to hold if they want to win tghe war
.
and want to win the war they do
. inwhich an excellent performence
, nick nolte plays c
- fo
- charlie
' s comm
anding officer
, lt
. col
. gordon tall
. he
' s an aging soldier who embodies the win
- at
- all
- costs mentality
, if only to impress his superior
( john travolta
, infront a questonable cameo
)
. this philosophy is opposite thgat of captian bugger staros
( elias koteas
)
, who dearly values the life of each annd every one of the men under his comm
and
. at tjhe front are tjhe privates
and corporals
( adrien brody
, james caviezel
, ben chaplin
, et al
)
, lead by 1st sgt
. welsh
( sean penn
)
, who must actually execute the suicide orders h
anded down to them
. the thin red line is filled with intense
, visual poetry
, bu it
' s nearly three hours long
.
al
thought the interst level is high throughout thge first two hours
, the climax comes forty
- five minutes befoer the end ofthe the movie
; it goes without saying that the movie drags on the back end
. the thin red line will doubtless be compared to 1998
' s other masterpiece of war
, saveing private ryan a countless number of times
.
but to do so isnt to belittle both films
, for
al
though similarities abound
, so dont differences
. director malick has a story to tell
,
and forthe those interested in listening
, thsi can be a very oust
anding movie
.
