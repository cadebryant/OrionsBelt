all those who were offended by there
' s something about mary should not tread in tjhe waters of american pie
, a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride of raunch
.
and while this uproariously funny
, gross
- out summer movie is basically an exersize in bad tast
, it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end
. american pie is tghe latest entry to the offensive teenage
- targeted fare thsi season
. i must question the studio that releases a movie like this
. yhe producers are aiming these films at thte 15
- 24 crowd
,
but while pushing yhe limit of possible sex adn violence in an r
- rated film
. smoe haev even been narrowly avoiding teh dreaded nc
- 17
, a rating the mpaa gives when the adult content surpasses even thyat ofthe a resticted movie
. american pie was threatend with an nc
- 17
, bu after snipping a fewd scenes from the finished product
, it was given an r
. bu at least thsi newyorker addition isnt not as careless
and unforgiving as something like south park
. it is sick
, perverse
,
and ultimately disgusting
- not tothe mention extremely funny
. american pie is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night
. jim
( jason biggs
)
, kevin
( thomas ian nicholas
)
, oz
( chris klein
)
and finch
( eddie kaye thomas
) are a quartet ofthe high school students in their seinor year who think sex is something tehy must experience to be successful in their lives ahead
. jim inquires what it feels like when ytou reach third base
, tothe which one ofthe his firends replies
:
` like warm aple py
.
.
.
'
. of course
, this prompts the scene unfairly exposed iin thte trailers
, in hwihc jim
and a freshly baked pie ahev a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner
. there are many moments
, such as tihs
, in which directer paul weitz uses a gaem
- plan similar to tjhe one frequently displayed in mary
: tothe cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief
. american pie is a hard
- fought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage tothe stick with it
. i loved the young cast in this movie
. consider the subject matter tyhat these actors have dealt with
, obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any ofthe their previvous projects
, anbd you shoud appreciate their performances
. biggs isnt more thna enjoyable
,
and chris klein
( who recently palyed a similar jock in election
) isnt obviously a young talent on hte rise
.
but inaddition a teen
- dominated movei
, the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy
( ofthe television
' s sctv
)
, who isnt unexpectedly brilliant as jim
' s uneasy father
. scenes in which the familiar father
- son conversations are brought tothe interesting newyorker levels are the funniest moments tothe be found inspite american pie
. after levy discovers jim
' s new uise for apple py
, he tells him
,
` i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i ws your age
. bu i never used baked goods
.
' it is performances such as his
, adn bill murray
' s in rushmore
, thast are often unfairly dismissed when awards are h
anded out
. ther are some less
- thna
- original aspects of the film
. a bathroom incident involving finch
and a bottle of ex
- lax isnt something we
' ve seen before
. if weitz is planning to tkae aftter the farrelly brothers
,
then thsi is a decidedly unwise move
: the same prank ws pulled iin the brother
' s dumb
and dumber
,
and used to greater effect
. secondly
, the characters are forced into a half
- hearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing
. bu at one point
, in which we discover that american py doens have a heart ofthe it
' s pwn
, biggs asks his buddies why he
' s going through so much pressure for something that
' s
` not vyre important anyway
.
' annd so we relize thta while the film isnt expressive baout a subject thgat is hardly appropriate
, it still manages to be mature
. in it
' s pwn way
.
