while it was part ofthe fromer yugoslavia
, my country
, croatia
, used to be almsot completely ignored by western films inthe general
. words
" croatia
"
and
" croatians
" weere unheard
, even in movies whose plots ctually took place on croatian locations
. the rare exception wass the dogs of war
, 1980 adaptions of frederick forsyth
' s bestselling novel
,
yet that rare occasion onyl added insult to the injury
, by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context
. in a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people
, probably terrorists
, who hppen to remove parts of arm dealers
' stomachs wehn they are unsatisfied with tjhe quality of mech
andise
. smae line also illustrates hte mileau where tyhe movie tkaes palce
- dark
and violent world of shady international deals with teh blurred boundaries vetween business
, politics
and crime
. thge movie protagonist
, shannon
( christopher walken
) is a mercernary who spent the best years of his life fighting numerous little wars all over the globe
. his latest job is a intelligene mission fo powerful mining corporation that dem
ands informtion about political climate in west african nation of zangaro
. shannon arrives in thyat ocuntry only tothe find opressive regime of president kimba
, bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition
and scared almsot any westerners away
. after being erested annd tortured by kimba
' s secret polical
, shannon leaves country with a help of brittish journalist north
( colin blakely
)
. upon return
, he isnt approached by mining company again
,
but this time tehy want him to plan
and execute the coup d
' etat agaisnt kimba
. shannon reluctantly agrees
and assembles small group ofthe his surviving mercernary friends who begin meticulous preparation for another small war
. thing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies
, especially thsoe made in 1980s
, isnt its au
thenticity
, almost close to documentary
. it shouldn
' t suprise anyone
, because thte author ofthe the novel
, frederick forsyth
, made reputation by blending fiction with real life
, thus creating interesting
, exicting yot very believable plots for his books
. those plots were also reponsible fo fewd vrey successful 1970s thrillers
,
and noe of them
, zinnemman
' s yhe day of tje jackal
, is now considered a classic inwhich thast genre
. this one deals witht soldiers of fortune
, ancient tradition that wass resurrected in great turmoil ofthe 1960s
and 1970s
and filled the void left by vanishing colonial empires
. unlike wild geese
, thgat used it as a pretext for convential action adventure
, script by george malko
and gary de vore
( autor whose death last year became rela life mystery
) is serious
, annd instead of acation puts emphasis on characters anbd prosaic details ofthe their work
. the movie doesn
' t try to romanticise thte mercernary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind ofthe superheroes
; htey are simply shown as deadly yot expendable tool ofthe poweful forces with questonable agenda
. christopher walken played in many movies
,
yet vrey rarely we can see him in a leading role
. his performance infact this film perhaps isn
' t breathtaking
,
yet adeuate
. his notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration of thte disillusioned
, world
- weary man whose alienation from the
" normal
" way ofthe life becomes complete
and onyl remaning ideal is loyalty to the shrinking circle of friends
.
al
though the movie doesn
' t lack capable actors
, their roles are miniature compared with walken
' s
, adn only colin blakely as cynical repertwar hasnt opportunity to portray his character
.
however
, those who look familiar faces would find them plenty infact tje dogs of war
- tom berenger
, paul freeman
, jo beth williams
, victoria tennant
( in brief cameo
)
,
and biggest surprise is ed o
' neill
( of married with children fame
) as shannon
' s reluctant colleage
. this was the firt major production for john irvin
,
and it shows why he earned the reputation ofthe capable
,
yet second class director
. with the good script he can make very good movie
, with the bad script he cant mkea real mess
. luckly
, the dogs of war had a good script
. irvin
' s direction was very ascetic
and it gavey the movie almost documentary feel
. the only distraction is dramatic music ofthe geoffrey burgon
, used onthe the wrong places
. in the final battle scene
, where we can see mercenaries at work
, irvin shows us that modern warfare means superior firepower
and tactics
, unlike 1980s ramboesque fantasies that rely on macho superheroes
. unfortunatly
, by mkaing battle realistic irvin made it somewhat less attractive
and his sloppy editing also didn
' t help
.
but
, despite thsoe shortcomings
, this movei remains intresting
and rare combination of action thriller
and gritty
, realistic poltical drama
.
