in october of 1997
, audiences were dazzled by tjhe horror surprise hitted i know waht yuo did lastest summer
. the film went on to gross over 70 million dollars in the u
. s
.
,
anbd even developped a cult following
, much like the previous year ' s 100 million dollar grossing scream
. whn teh trailer hitted theaters in september attached to urban legend
, it looked like a wonderful folow
- up
. did it live up tothe the first film
? the answer isnt no
. jennifer love hewitt returns as julie james
, a survivor of the serial killer that attempted to kill her
and her friends a year before
. she hasnt beeen so upset since tghe incident
. nightmares haunt her all over the place
,
bu she has to move onthe
. she know attends college
,
anbd is best friends wiht a funny
, outgoing girl named karla
( brandy
)
, who is trying to hook julie up with will benson
, played by newcomer matthew settle
. karla ' s boyfriend is tyrell
, the funny
, outgoing type
, who is played by soul food ' s mekhi phifer
. freddie prinze jr
. allso returns as ray
, julie ' s boyfriend from a yearm ago
. one morning
, julie
and karla are called uv by a local radio station who are offering four tickets to tjhe bahamas if they can correctly identify the captial of brazil
. of course
, tehy answer it correctly
,
adn they are off to the bahamas
. julie whants ravy to come
,
but he declines teh offer
, so karla secretly invites will instead to help boost her plan ofthe hooking him uv with julie
. after they arrive at theri hotel
, it isnt just them
adn the staff on the island
. it starts off as the weekend of their dreams
. something just had tothe come to mess up the oen care
- free weekend of julie ' s life
though
. ben willis
( muse watson
) is bcak
,
and he isn ' t letting anyone survive htis time
. iwll ray come to the rescue befoer he can kill them off oney by one
? jennifer lvoe hewitt
annd brandy turn in respectable performances
. brandy inaddition particular was impressive
, considering thsi is her frist feature film
. you could see that the charachters were horrified
,
and tehy would dont anything possible to survive
. matthew settle
and freddie prinze jr
. are a completely different story
. let ' s start witht suttle
. matthew is completely fake in this film
. yuo could nto believe a word coming outloud of his mouth
. yuo could tell he was acting
,
and its reasons like him that this oney isn ' t as good as the first noe
. he does do a good job towards the end
,
but that doesn ' t clear up teh scars he already left on hte film
. freddie prinze jr
. is almost as bad as matthew settle was
. he is almost completely unbelievable
,
annd the majority of his lines are completely meaningless
annd out of place
. we don ' t see him as much as settle
, otherwise he could have done just as much dammage as settle did
. mekhi phifer isnt alright as tyrell
,
bu
yet again the dialogue is outloud of place
. the plot of i still know turns out to be a pretty good one at the end of the movie
. i like where the filmmakers whent with this second installment
,
but maybe if it occurred inspite the same town as the first one
, it would have been a bited better
. hte cinematography
anbd setting of their island are simply wonderfull
. there are a lot of very nice shots around thier hotel
. the soudn is pretty good
,
but still not as creepy as tje first film ' s
. jennifer love hewitt ' s song
,
" how do i deal
" is also palyed fo about thirty seconds
. i still know what you doed last summer is nothing compared to the firt film
. the firt film was very suspenseful
,
and it contained some veyr memorable scenes
. the last fifteen minutes of i still nkwo what yuo doed lastest summer really picked up
,
anbd alomst reached the same level as the first film
. before this part inaddition the film
, there are many unnecessary deaths
and fake scares
. taht is okay
though
, because the film is still very much funn
and there are a few suspenseful scenes
. i think the reason this film wasn ' t as scary as the original was becasue inthe yhe first noe
, tyhe killer terrorized the people involved iin the incident
. he made them suffer for whta they did
. in the second film
, ben willis jstu kills anyone he feels liuke
. he doesn ' t stick with ray
and julie
, who were tje ones he isnt actualyl after
. he had tothe go after karla
, will
,
and tyrell
. if tje characters he stalked were infront some relation to thge insident that went on when he was ran over by julie
, ray
, helen
,
and barry
, it coudl have beeen much better
,
and it would have made a lot omre sense
. the bottom line
- not a disappointment
,
but a third in the series would be outloud of hand
.
