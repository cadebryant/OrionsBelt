inthe octobur of 1997
, audiences were dazzled by tghe horror surprise hitted i knwo what you did last summer
. yhe film whent on tothe gross over 70 milion dollars infront the u
. s
.
,
and even developped a cult following
, much like the previvous year
' s 100 million dollar grossing scream
. when the trailer hitted theaters in september attached to urban legend
, it looked like a wonderfull followup
- uv
. did it live up to the first film
? the answer is no
. jennifer lvoe hewitt returns as julie james
, a surviver ofthe the serial killer that attempted to kill her
and her friends a year before
. she has beeen so upset sicne thte incident
. nightmares haunt her all over the place
,
but she hasnt to move on
. she know attends college
,
and isnt best friends whith a funny
, outgoing girl named karla
( br
andy
)
, who isnt trying to hook julie up with iwll benson
, plyed by newcomer matthew suttle
. karla
' s boyfriend is tyrell
, the funny
, outgoing tipe
, who is played by soul fod
' s mekhi phifer
. freddie prinze jr
. also returns as ravy
, julie
' s boyfriend fomr a year ago
. oney morning
, julie
and karla are called uv by a local rdio station who are offering four tickets to teh bahamas if they can correctly identify the capital of brazil
. of course
, they answer it correctly
,
and tehy are off to the bahamas
. julie wants ray to come
, bu he declines thte offer
, so karla secretly invites will instade to help boost her plan of hooking him uv wtih julie
. after they arrive at their hotel
, it is just them adn the staff on the isl
and
. it starts off as the weekend of theri dreams
. something just had to come to mess up the one care
- free weekend of julie
' s life
though
. ben willis
( muse watson
) is back
, anbd he isn
' t letting anyone survive this time
. wiull ravy come to the rescure before he can kill them off one by one
? jennifer love hewitt adn br
andy turn in respectable performances
. br
andy in particular was impressive
, considering tihs is her first feature film
. ytou could see that thte characters weere horrified
,
and tehy would do anytying possibile to survive
. matthew suttle anbd freddie prinze jr
. are a completly diffrent stoyr
. let
' s strat with settle
. matthew is completely fake in this film
. you could not beileve a word coming out of his mouth
. ytou coudl tell he was acting
, annd its reasons liek him that thsi one isn
' t as good as tjhe first one
. he does dont a ogod job towards the end
,
but that doesn
' t clear up the scars he already left on the film
. freddie prinze jr
. isnt almost as bad as matthew settle was
. he is almost completelyl unbelievable
, adn the majority ofthe his lines are completely meaningless
and out ofthe place
. we don
' t see him as much as settle
, otherwise he coudl have done just as much dammage as settle doed
. mekhi phifer is alright as tyrell
,
but
yet again tghe dialogue is outloud of place
. hte plot of i still know turns out tothe be a pretty good one at the end of the movei
. i like where the filmmakers whent with this second installment
,
but maeby if it ocurred inthe the same twon as the first one
, it would have been a bit better
. the cinematography
and setting of their isl
and are simply wonderful
. there are a lot of very nice shots arround theri hotel
. the soudn is pretty ogod
, bu still nto as creepy as the first film
' s
. jennifer love hewitt
' s song
,
" how dont i dael
" isnt also played for about thirty seconds
. i still know wqat ytou doed last summer isnt nothing compared tothe the first film
. the first film was vrey suspenseful
,
and it contained some veyr memorable scenes
. the last fifteen minutes of i still know waht you did lastr summer really picked uv
, anbd almost reached the smae level as the first film
. before this part inthe the film
, there are many uneccesary deaths
and fake scares
. that is okay
though
, becouse the film is still very much funn anbd htere are a fewd suspenseful scenes
. i think teh reason this film wasn
' t as csary as the orignal was because in the first noe
, the killer terrorized the people involved in tghe insident
. he made them suffer for what they did
. infact the second film
, ben willis just kills anyone he feels like
. he doesn
' t stick with ravy adn julie
, who were the ones he is actually after
. he had to go after karla
, will
,
and tyrell
. if the characters he stalked weere in some relation to the insident tht went onthe when he was ran over by julie
, ray
, helen
,
and barry
, it could have been much better
,
and it would ahve made a lot omre sense
. the bottom line
- not a disappointment
,
but a third in the series would be out ofthe h
and
.
