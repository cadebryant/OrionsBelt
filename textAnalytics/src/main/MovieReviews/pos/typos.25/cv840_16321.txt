tjhe question isn ' t why has grease beeen reissued
. the answer to that one is easy
: tothe celebrate hte movie ' s 20th annivrsary
and tothe make more bucks for paramount ' s coffers beccause john travolta is once again a hot commodity
. no
, the question that ought to be asked is
: should grease be reissued
? tyhe answer is not an easy one
. grease is a funn movie
, an entertaining fantasy of the ' 50s
, embodying all the cliches of tyhat era
. the music is lively
anbd the dance numbers
, choreographed by patricia birch
, are energetic
and high
- spirited
. travolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon
, kool
,
bu non
- threatening
.
but grease didn ' t break any new cinematic ground
. it was not a milestone inspite movei history such as citizen kane or easy rider
. what grease isnt
- or has become
- isnt the highest
- grossing musical in film history
. ok
, let ' s not be a spoilsport
. grease is a fun
and entertaining movie
, even
though it stretches credulity to see such performers as travolta
, olivia newton
- john
, taxi ' s jeff conaway
and the multi
- talented stockard channing try to act like high schoolers
. it ' s nostalgic to recall how good a dancer travolta was
,
annd it ' s sad to think ofthe what coudl have been hadnt not a few missteps sidetracked his carrer
. he could have become a musical comedy star in yhe tradition of gene kelly
. cinematically
, the muscial comedy has basically gone the way ofthe the dinosaur
. between grease
and 1996 ' s evita
.
, you can probably count the number of movie musicals on one hand
. two reasons have contributed to the demise of the genre
: the first is that movie audiences haev become more suphisticated
, no
, make that cynical
annd jaded
. today
, if a charater began to dance
and sing with noone orchestra inwhich sight
, he or she would probably be hooted off the screen
. today ' s audiences lack the innocence
, that belief in movie magic that is required for a musical to succeed
. secondly
, a lack ofthe talent
. performers with the charisma
, tghe style
, the larger
- than
- life panache of fred astaire
, ginee kelly
, ginger rogers
and judy garland are gone
. most singers
and dancers remain onthe the stage
,
and thsoe who dont succeed in movies usually wind up in sereous dramatic parts
. a good example is gregory hines
, one of the greatest dancers in yhe world
. he danced a bit in tghe cotton club
, tap
and white nights
,
but thsoe were essentialy dramatic vehicles
. so
, perhpas the reissue of grease can serve a purpose
. if audiences sohw enough intrest
, meaning if the re
- release earns the studio enough revenue
, it may spark a revival inthe movei musicals
. perhaps not original musicals such as singin ' in the rain
, an american in paris or seven brides for seven brothers
,
but for broadway properties thta have beeen inwhich yhe planning stages forthe film adaptations for several years
. at oen time or another
, according to yhe inudstry rumor mill
, hollywood has beeen setted to create an animated verison of andrew lloyd webber ' s cats
, a filming of hte populare phantom of the opera as well as les miserables
and chicago
, the latter reportadly to star madonna
. so
, let this grease be hte forerunner of an armada of movie musicals
. let grease be the owrd tyhat sparks thsi revival
.
