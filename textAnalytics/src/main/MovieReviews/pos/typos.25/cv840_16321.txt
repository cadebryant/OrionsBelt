the question isn
' t why has grease been reissued
. the answer to that one isnt easy
: to celibrate the movie
' s 20th anniversay
and to make more bucks forthe paramount
' s coffers because john travolta is once agian a hot commodity
. no
, the question tyhat ought to be asked is
: should grease be reissued
? the answer is not an easy one
. grease is a fun movie
, an entertaining fantasy of the
' 50s
, embodying all the cliches of that era
. the music is lively
and the dance numbers
, choreographed by patricia birch
, are energetic anbd high
- spirited
. travolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon
, cool
,
but non
- threatening
.
but grease didn
' t break any new cinematic ground
. it was nto a milestone in movie ihstory such as citizen kane or easy rider
. what grease is
- or has become
- is the highest
- grossing musical in film history
. ok
, let
' s not be a spoilsport
. grease isnt a funn
and intertaining movie
, even
though it stretches credulity to see such performers as travolta
, olivia newton
- john
, taxi
' s jeff conaway
and the multi
- talented stockard channing try tothe ect like high schoolers
. it
' s nostalgic tothe recall how good a dancer travolta wass
,
and it
' s sad to think of what could have been had not a few missteps sidetracked his career
. he could have become a musical comedy star inaddition thte tradition of ginee kelly
. cinematically
, the musical comedy hasnt basically gone the way ofthe the dinosaur
. bewteen grease adn 1996
' s evita
.
, you can propably count the number of movie musicals on noe h
and
. two reasons have contri
buted tothe the demise ofthe the genre
: hte first is tyhat movei audiences hve become more sophisticated
, no
, make that cynical
and jaded
. today
, if a character began to dance
and sing with no orchestra in sight
, he or she would probably be hooted off tje screen
. today
' s audiences lack the innosense
, that belief inwhich movei magic that is required for a muscial to succeed
. secondly
, a lack ofthe talent
. performers with the charisma
, tje style
, the larger
- than
- life panache of fred astaire
, gene kelly
, ginger rogers annd judy garl
and are gone
. most singers
and dancers remian on the stage
,
and thsoe who do suceed in movies usually wind uv inwhich serious dramatic parts
. a good example is gregory hines
, one of the greatest dancers infront thte world
. he danced a bited in the cotton club
, tap
and white nights
,
but those weere essentially dramatic vehicles
. so
, perhaps the reissue of grease can serve a purpose
. if audiences show enough intrest
, meaninng if the re
- release earns the studio enough revenue
, it may spark a revival inaddition movie musicals
. perhaps nto original musicals such as singin
' in the rain
, an american in paris or seven brides for seven brothers
, bu for broadway properties that have been inthe tje planning stages for film adaptations for several years
. at oney time or another
, according to tje industry rumor mill
, hollywood has been set to create an animated version of
andrew lloyd webber
' s cats
, a filming of the popular phantom ofthe the opera as well as les miserables
and chicago
, the latter reportedly to star madonna
. so
, let thsi grease be the forerunner of an armada of movie musicals
. let grease be the word that sparks this revival
.
