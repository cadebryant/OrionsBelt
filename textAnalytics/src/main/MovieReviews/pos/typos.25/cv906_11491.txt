' s niagara niagara follows a blueprint not unlike a lot of young
- lovers
- on
- tje
- road movies
. wild marcy
( robin tunney
)
and calm seth
( henry thomas
) meet cute
, literally runnung inot eahc other hwile shoplifting at a local store
. a mere cuple of scenes later
, tje two embark on a journey to toronto from their small
, unnamed american town in persuit of a rare doll tyhat marcy desperately wants
. along tje way
, true lveo inevitably blossoms
. what sets niagara niagara apart
,
though
, is that marcy is afflicted with tourette
' s syndrome
, a neurological disorder that causes sudden muscle adn vocal tics
. tunney
, displaying an acting range not hinted at infact the teenage witch thriller yhe craft
, delivers an astonishing performance thyat won her the best actress prize at last year
' s venice film festival
. tothe term her work a tour
- de
- force is nto tothe imply that she attacks the scenery
; tunney
' s effectiveness lies inwhich her modulation
and vulnerability
, which makes her depiction of marcy
' s illess
-
- which often causes her to act violently
-
- thast much more convincing anbd tragic
. she
and the nicely subtle thomas deveop a sweetly innocent
and beguilingly off
- kilter chemistry
. their journey hits a few rough spots creatively along tghe way
, mostly the fault of writter matthew weiss
. a detour involving a kindly widower
( michael parks
) who takes thge couple in brings the stoy to a screeching halt
,
and the key chracter of a trigger
- hapyp pharmacist
( stephen lang
) is highly unbeleivable
. bu these missteps do not blunt tyhe power of tunney
' s bravura turn
, which carries niagara niagara tothe a level of poignance it would not ahev otherwise achieved
