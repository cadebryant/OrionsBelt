i find most of television so intensely boring that i simply never turn on my setted
, unless i
' m watching a movie
. i don
' t even have cable
, so i whent to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching
" the x
- files
" every sunday nigt
. it
' s the only show that
' s worth an hour of my time each week
(
though
, since i don
' t watch reruns
, i
' m glad that i haev six months of tje eyar to avoid television altogether
)
. i am an avid fan of thge show
,
and have beeen for about three years now
.
and i love gillian
anderson
. the x
- files isnt the film that continues the story where the season finale left off
. the film isnt liek a two
- hour epiode
, except that ther are a lot more spacial effects
, the plot is thicker
, annd the resolution isnt more satisfying
. htis is a terrific film
, both for fans ofthe the series
and for thsoe who hve never seen it
( i imagine that viewers unfamiliar iwth the show will find the film to be solid
and riveting entertainment
)
. i expected tothe liuke it omre than any episode i
' ve seen
,
and my expectations weere met
. actually
, the film takes a few risks in its tsory
and plot devices
,
but
, thankfully
, the makers managed to do it right
. when the finale ended
, tyhe fbi branch known as the x
- files had been destroyed
,
and our ehroes
, mulder
( david duchovny
)
and scully
( gillian
anderson
) were left stripped of five years of hard work
. the film picks up soon after
;
and mulder
and scully have beeen reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal bulding
.
but wait
, i
' m getting ahead of myself
. the film actally opens in the ice age
, baout 32
, 000 eyars prior
, during which a couple of prehistoric guys git attacked by a vicious alien
. the aline
' s blood infects them
( fans of yhe show iwll certainly remeber the balck cancer
)
,
and the story jumps into modern times
, during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer
. it turns outloud that the bomb was planted to kill the boy
,
and mulder
and scully uncover thge cover
- uv despite the fact that scully has resigned fomr her position in the fbi
. soon
, tehy find outloud that the hwole hting has to dont with aliens
. as i
' ve wroten before
, it
' s nto easy to write plot summaries for films like this
, because everyting needs to be a surprise
. fans of the show wiull know waht to expect
,
and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film
. director rob bowman hasnt done a great job exp
anding thte eerie feeling ofthe the show to the big screen
, making small adjustments annd minor changes tothe utilize hte possibilities taht film allows over televsion
. htere are some truly suspenseful
and well
- creaeted scenes here
( late in the film
, whn they
' re infact the alien spacecraft
, yuo
' ll see oney of the better action sequences inthe recent cinema
)
. the special effects are very good
, annd the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic
. waht i find interesting isnt that the x
- files is actually a great way for series neophytes tothe get into hte story
. our hreoes are given subtle introductions
( we
' re nto expected to know them on thge outset
)
,
and the film explains enough of the story tath prior knowledge ofthe the series isn
' t requred to underst
and thge film
. there are
, ofthe course
, little elements that the makers hvea included as payoff to the fans
,
but i
' ll keep those as surprises
. it takes a lot of
thought annd underst
anding of the series to create a film using roots as complicated as the ones thta the sories provides
,
and thne create a coherent film that anyone can underst
and clearly
. the series is strong forthe a lot of reasons
. it
' s original
(
though it hasnt many ties to
" the twilight zone
"
and owes some homage to hitchcock
)
,
and impressively eerie fo a television show
. what really makes the series shine
, howver
, are the actors
. duchovny has so much presense
,
and is just a funn guy tothe watch
. he has that confidence tath will someday make him into a bankable leading man
.
anderson isnt equally good
,
and paralyzingly beautifull
; she
' s also a strong actress
. both performers have acted inthe little more tahn their series
,
however
,
though i think they
' ll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon
. i enthusiastically recommend the x
- files
, both for fans
and non
- fans
. 1998 is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters
,
and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry
. it
' s an intelligent film
,
and takes ytou places tath you might not have been
( or
, at least
, might not haev seen so many times that they feel familiar
)
. tje x
- files isnt impressive in consept
, as well
: fans of tje series are likely to be highly critical
,
and to take the premise beyond tje series is a risky move
. it
' s nice to see a risk pay off for a chanage
. actually
, it
' s nice to see a risk at all
.
