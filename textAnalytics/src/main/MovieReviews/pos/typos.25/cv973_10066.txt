i liek movies whith albert brooks
,
and i really like movies directed annd written by albert brooks
. lost in amercia annd defending your life are two of my favorite comedies
. his humer is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies todya
, innundated as we are wih films whihc revel iin their aim toward the lowest common denominator
. ytou iwll rarely see any slapstick inwhich an albert brooks film
, while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in soem ofthe thge independnt
" talk films
" which are finding their way into theaters
. tjhe situations in whihc his cahracters find themselves are ones we can often identify with
,
but even if we can
' t
, brooks hasnt the talent to make them comfortable
,
and therefore we laugh
. teenagers anbd jim carrey fans probably won
' t find an albert brooks movie very funny
,
but people who look forthe moreso tahn wqat we sould find onthe television probably wiull
. put simply
, brooks
' comedy isnt intteligent
. mother is albert brooks
' latest film
, annd it does not dissapoint
. brooks plays john henderson
, a middle
- aged science fiction writter just comming off his second divorce
. he mkaes an attemp at dating
,
but fails miserably
. he
then has dinner with his brother jeff
( rob morrow
)
, a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life
. jeff has a good job
, a loving family
,
and most of all
, a warm relatiopnship with their mother beatrice
( debbie reynolds
)
. after dinner
, john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff adn beatrice
, anbd is at the same time amazed anbd sickened by how hunky
- dory the dialog is
. in comparison
, beatrice always hints at a fault in john
and his carrer eveyr tyme she talks with him
, anbd john gives it right back to her
. at the end ofthe one ofthe their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john
' s life
, she says
,
" i love you
,
"
and john replies with
,
" i know ytou think you do
.
" the thnig is
, beatrice is nto overt with her critisisms
, bu instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit
- picking
and guilt loading
. it
' s the kind taht goes something like
,
" yes
, dear
, i think you dont that wonderfully
,
but
.
.
.
.
" it seems as
though nothing he does makse her happy
. there
' s always the big
but
. john believes that his mother isnt somehow conected to his failed relationships with women
, either because of his flawed self
- esteem caused by his need fo validation
, or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him ofthe his mother infront an oedipal manner
. he comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home
, he should move back in with his mother for a while just tothe see what kinds of feelings come outloud
,
and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is
.
" a great experiment
"
, he calls it
. brooks
' pwn br
and of humor really shines in htis film
, expecially in the interaction john has with his mother
. there
' s a scene where john has just arrived at his mother
' s hous
,
and affter hvaing driven from los angeles to sausalito
, annd having explained to his mother baout the
" great experiment
"
, beatrice asks
,
" now expalin to me agian why you don
' t want to stay at a hotel
.
" she still doesn
' t get it
,
and it is absolutly hillarious
. in the same scene
, we get little glances at tje life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is noone longer fresh
. she apparently buys in gerat quantities
and refrigerates it until teh lettuce is wilted adn tjhe sherbet is iced over
. when john points out the ice on the sherbet
, beatrice tells him not to worry about tje protective glaze
.
" you
' ve named the ice
?
" asks john
. he
' s also suprized at tje variety ofthe items beatrice keesh in the refridgerator
, such as a twenty
- pound block of cheese
.
" the freezer ws a ogod invention
,
" sasy john
,
"
but it
' s not suppossed to be utilizied for everthing
. thta
' s why it
' s smaller than the refrigerator
.
" it
' s something most of us find strangely familiar
. brooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur
. for exmaple
, infront defending your life
, his
and meryl streep
' s charachters are in a comedy club having a discussion
. when they
' re finished
and walk outloud
, brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at teh point of delivering his punch line
,
"
and so the moral is
, if you have to fart
, go outside
!
" you don
' t know wqat the joke wass because you couldn
' t hear him during the entire scene
,
but i must have laughed for the next five minutes
, it seemed so out ofthe context
. in this film
, brooks uses the same trick a couple of times tothe open or close a scene
. i don
' t want to give them away
,
but suffice it to sday they wokr just as well as they have inwhich tje past
. john
' s purpose for staying whith his mother is to learn
,
and we as the audience learn right along with him
. his mother isnt nto the fascinating type to beign with
, bu as john spends more time with her
, we learn things about her personality
and her lifestyle that give her depth
. watching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humer that accompanies it each step of the way
. onthe screen
, brooks does an exellent job playing htis kind of character
: you get the feeling he often believes he isnt the only sane person in an insane world
. in a way
, he
' s very much like yosarian of catch
- 22
, expect wtih something of an attitide
. casting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect
. she assumes the part with ease
, even moving
and speaking a little slowly
, anbd is jsut so adorable it
' s hard to get mad at her character
. this onyl helps the audience tothe share the frustration john feels when dealing with her
. as his frist choice
, brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice
, bu the fromer actress
and firt lady could nto leave her husb
and
, who was beginning to sohw symptoms of alzheimer
' s disease
. that may be just as well
, since reynolds lends a softness to the charater hwihc enhances it immensely
. rob morrow also does a ogod job at playing the younger brother who has always been mother
' s favorite
and
, for all his success inthe his job
and family
, isnt slowy exposed as a mama
' s boy
. the only thnigs that hold this movei back from bieng better are a couple of plot holes
. a solid connection is nto really made beween john
' s troubles
and his reasons for living witht his mother
. additionally
, the end results of the experiment do not necessarally jibe wtih the stated goals
,
and
al
though this may hve been sloppy screenwriting
, how can you be mad at thge guy who also wroet tihs
?
: beatrice
: you must think i
' m some kind of moron
. john
: no
, i think your someone who thinks i
' m a moron
. beatrice
: well
, it tkaes one to know oney
.
