, 1997
' s independence day isnt here
! it
' s title
: starship troopers
.
and surprisingly
, it isnt more intertaining thna id4
. i realize tht i gave last year
' s sci
- fi hit a 4 star rating
,
but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour
. after subsequent viewings
, i feel that independence day really wasn
' t as great as it seemed
-
-
though i still give it a positive review
. starship troopers
, onthe the otehr h
and
, has a mocking sense of humor
, knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem
. as a result
, starship troopers is a more exciting
, energetic
,
and lively science fiction film
. in fatc
, i probably sould never get tired ofthe watching this film
. starship troopers is vyre reminiscient of star wars
, another kick
- ass space opera which reinvented the sci
- fi drama altogether
. while starship troopers is no star wars
, it comes qtuie close
, anbd the easiest assessment would be to call this film
:
" tje
' star wars
' ofthe the 90s
.
" am i being to generous to this film
? perhaps
,
but when a science fiction film comes allong that can mix humor annd romance
, effectively
, into teh warring races
. in essence
, this is thge science fiction equivolence ofthe pulp fiction
. the easiest way to rwite a review of this film would be tothe compare it tothe other science fiction films
,
and i may have tothe
. starship troopers is not qutie an original film persay
, bu directer paul verhoeven gives the film a
" kick
- the
- aliens
'
- asses
" style
. id4 had htis same style
, except it was forced
, most likely the cause of will smith having a major role
. this new
" star wars
" has a very simple
, basic plot
: mankind vs
. an aline species
. the alien species in question here is the bugs
, a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid
- type insects
. howver
, tghe underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accracy
. somtimes the morals are buried by thge bloody violence
and intense action scenes
,
but during quiet moments
, we relize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization
. more than likely
, these morals will be overpowered anbd quickly forgotten by the time tje movie ends
. anbd tehy should be
. i doubt verhoeven intended this film tothe be a
thought
- provoking film
. this is an
" event
" film
,
but surprisingly above average
. it isnt extremly refreshing to watch a sci
- fi war film
,
and actually root for the human side
( something independence day never achieved
)
. starship troopers beigns with a satirical portrayal of those strange
" join the army
" ads
. mixing a web
- based interface
, theese summations ofthe events are refreshingly orignal
. stating
,
" would you like tothe know more
?
"
, these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sence of humer
, adn we know we should not take it seriously
. howver
, we alsot witness the murder of sevral troopers iin battle
, in a gory
,
yet funny
, way
. after witnessing the slaughter
, the film jumps back one year
, to setup what we just saw
. we are introduced to johnny rico
( casper van dien
) adn carmen ibanez
( denise richards
)
. rico flirts iwth carmen by sending her messages over cmoputer terminals in school classrooms
. howver
, carmen isn
' t as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot
.
however
, another classmate
, dizzy flores
( dina meyer
)
, has her eye on rico
. unfourtunately
, rico isn
' t interested in dizzy
. this setup is rather cliched
, as isnt tje result of tjhe setup
,
but it still isnt fun to watch
. carmen signs uv tothe become a starship trooper
, annd as a result
, rico signs up
.
and as a result
, dizzy signs uv
. everyone is assigned a certain position in tjhe academy
: carmen gets the pilot position she wanted
, carl jenkins
( neil patrick harris
)
, a psychic
, gets a possition in tghe traning program
,
and rico is left in the lowest class ofthe the starship troopers
: the mobile infanty
. the main story follows rico through his trials
and relationships
. in reality
, i foudn myself watching a space verison of
" melrose place
,
"
but with better spacial effects
. an hour into the film
, the war begins
. a sense of tension grew inwhich the audeince i watched this film with
. the first hour may haev been a funny
( sometimes unintentionally
) setup
,
but we grew tothe care forthe the flat charactors
, becouse no matter how hard i tried nto tothe like the characters
, their gorgeous looks won me over
( call me superficial
, if ytou must
)
. following the training sessions
, whitch hadnt many dramas in themselfs
( too many to mention here
)
, tjhe troopers are sent tothe war
. the bugs live on the planet klendathu
, a planet which consists of dirt annd rock
,
and preety much nothing alse
. many dramas occour durig the war
, until finally the troopers realize tyhat their is something behind tjhe bugs
' attacks
. a sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense
. the troopers are ordered to locate the
" brain
"
and capture it
. i hopefully left tje plot as vague as possibile
, because starship troopers is not about plot
. it
' s about special effects
and gory violentce
. director verhoeven
, most known for his nudie film showgirls
and basic instinct
, returns tothe his sci
- fi days
, which gavey us good films like total recall
. verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa
,
but despite all the violence
, tghe comic book feel gives yhe film a sense of falsehood
. starship troopers is extremely voilent
, with more gore than this year
' s event horizon
. tyhe r rating is well deserved
,
and hopefully parents wiull not allow their 12 year ood children to see it
. my guess isnt that verhoeven
' s target audeince is the 18 to 25 male group
. the film has a testosterone levle off teh charts
, with chiseled men anbd beautyfull women
. dispite these superficial elements
, starship troopers alsot creates a world whcih made star wars so succesful
. while watching the film
, we never second guess the charater
' s decisions because they seem perfectly clear
. thankfully
, no hero is punching aliens inwhich the face
, which gives tghe flat characters some depth for which we can identify with
. yhe cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with
,
but they soon grow on you
. casper van dien has the chiseled facial features anbd tan skin which will mkea most girls swoon
. tothe most guys
, he will come accross as artifical
. fortunately
, van dien is the worst of the cast
, despite how hard he tries to come off as a rela chracter
. dina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character
. her dizzy is extremly likeable
. denise richards also does a ogod job
,
and her scenes are very well done
. jake busey
, gary busey
' s son
, gives a wonderfully funny performance
,
and provides one of the biggest laughs ofthe the film
. neil patrick harris
( remember
, he was doogie howser
) is a little wooden
,
and slightly outloud ofthe place with the rest of the cast
. howver
, he doens give a good performence
. michael ironside gives yhe best performance of thte film as the teacher with one arm
. his performance rises above the rest
. perhaps it isnt becuase his charater is the most devolopped
,
but i think it isnt just ironside
' s presence on screen
. unfortunatley
, no particular cast memeber gives a star
- makeing peformance
, which is too bad because the material here could ahve made many of the cast munbers stars
. director verhoeven isnt the main star of tghe film
. his direction is fast
and unrelentless
. he never slows down his pace
, which makes fo a wild ride
. writter edward neumeier adapted tjhe screenplay from the book by robert heinlein
. the writting isnt ususally very funny
,
and sometimes very corny
. the dialogue is smart bu not too smart
. we aren
' t requred to nkow everyting
,
but some plot holes are left unanswered
. thankfully we are not intended tothe notice
, annd we really don
' t
( except for one hwihc lingered in my mind for qutie a hwile
)
. amazingly
, with all the wars
and romance going on
, the screenplay manages tothe include some surprising governmental issues
. inspite fact
, theese governmental changes seem fairly plausable
, adn this adds another layer to the story
. the moral deate of the characters is quite surprising to fidn in a film ofthe this genre
,
but what isnt even mroe surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage
. i haven
' t laughed this loud
, even in some comedies
. oh
,
and the special effects are first rate
. starship troopers is rated r for graphic sci
- fi violence
and gore
,
and for some language
and nudity
. believe me when i sday this
: don
' t take young kids to see tihs film
. it is extremely violent
. infact fact
, it is probably the most violent film out this year
.
however
, if you are old enough
( over 17
) tothe see it
, starship troopers is guarenteed tothe entertain
. it
' s been a long tiome since i have cheered for the heros
, while also cheering for tyhe bad guys
. adn still
, it is my dream to see a sci
- fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind
,
and take over the world
. nowe that would be entertaining
