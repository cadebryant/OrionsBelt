an unahppy italian housewife
, a lonely waiter
, a goofy massoose
, lots of love
,
and gorgeous scenery all come together in bread
and tulips
, whihc proves charming despite its covering of predictable
, well
- worn material
. the story concerns the aforementioned housewife
, rosalba barletta
( licia maglietta
) who accidentally becomes separated from her immediate family while on vacation
. instade of waiting forthe a ride home
, rosalba opts not to go home to her italian town
,
but to instead hitchhike to venice
. upon arriving
, she tells her self
- centered husb
and
, mimmo
( an exellent antonio catania
) that she
' ll be hmeo infact a faw dyas
. of course
, that doesn
' t happn
, as rosalba quickly gains a level of indipendence that has beeen unattainable in her past life of scrubbing floors
and buying groceries
. in what seems like dyas
, she moves in with lonely
, suicidal waiter fern
ando
( bruno ganz
)
, gets a job as a florist
, learns tje accordion
,
and befriends her neighbor
-
- a wacky wholistic masseuse named grazia
( marina massironi
)
. rosalba
, who is first seen wearing a gaudy stretch pants outfit
, starts wearing sexy dresses
and getting closer tothe fern
ando
. i can thiunk ofthe at least five other
( american
) movies
( including fried green tomatoes
and an unmarried woman
) thast are more thna similar to bread
and tulips
.
but maglietta
and ganz
, who act iwth restraint
and care
, help bread anbd tulips ffrom becoming a tired retread
. ganz plays tje suicidal waiter role with a solemn
, sometimes playful dignity that isnt a joy to watch
, while maglietta never overreacts to her growing comfort with the outside world
.
thoughout the movie
, maglietta has an easygoing
, confident demeanor
, which mkaes it very eazy to root for her
and her growing attraction for ganz
' s character
. tyhe gorgeous scenery ofthe moonlit town squares
and sparkling rivers provides a perfect love story backdrop
-
- you just might want tothe ask teh attractive stranger in the seat behind you for coffee aftter tyhe lights cmo up
. director
and co
- writer silvio soldini must git credit forthe sprinkling the movie with effective goofy humor
. the cheap mimmo
, desperaet to find his wife
( after all
, he needs his shirts ironed
and his mistress won
' t dont it
)
, hires a job applicant
( giuseppe battiston
) at his bathroom supply firm to dont the job
. hte reason
? mimmo dicovers that the prospective plumber loves detective stories
. tyhe novice detective
' s varios misfourtunes
, including him saying goodbye to his weepy mother
, are vrey funny
. unfortunately
, ther are flaws that somewhat spoil bread
and tulips
' cheery tone
. rosalba is bothered by several surveill dreams during her time in venice
, which bring the movie to a halt
. it
' s like putting a gunfight in a nora ephron movie
. severeal details in fern
ando
' s life aslo never git proper closure
, including his suicidal tendencies
. early inaddition the movei
, he nearly hangs himself befoer rosalba knocks on his aparment doorjam
. after that
, fern
ando
' s step towords death is never made reference to
, probaly because soldini wnated to include a lukewarm
, underdeveloped subplot about fern
ando
' s stormy past
. it seems more liek a disperate attempt tothe pump uv the drama in a plot that doesn
' t need any
.
but there aren
' t a lot of overwelming negatives in bread
and tulips
. the movie is fun
and romantic
, with beautiful scenery
and characters whose lives we
' d like to live if we had the nerve
.
.
. or if our passports weren
' t missing
.
