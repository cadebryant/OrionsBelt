since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they
' re portraying
, it
' s fitting to say that
" beloved
" come as a real shock as a film
. it
' s confusing
, bizarre
,
and as tough a film to watch as any film i
' ve seen all eyar
, annd that
' s not neccessarily because of the threee
- hour running tiem
.
" beloved
" is challenging to watch
, filled with tough
and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard
,
and instade of a straight
- foward
, hollywood
- ized story about what happened to the slaves after htey were freed
,
" beloved
" comes off as a cry of anguish from all thsoe who actually lived thru what happended
( or
, rather
, toni morrison
, who wrote the novel upon which this is based
)
.
" beloved
" tells the story of an ex
- slave named sethe
, played by oprah winfrey
, who lives on a larg farm in the noth with her childen
. whn the film opens
, her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist
, which shakes things uv
, wounds the dog
,
and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family
. sethe is proud
,
though
,
and will not move
. her sons run awya
, leaving only her
and her daughter
, denver
( kimberly elise
) alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation
. a couple years pass
, adn tghe ghost remains
,
and one day
, a man named paul d
( danny glover
)
, another ex
- slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked onthe a plantation together
, arrives
, asking for lodging
. he has beeen w
andering around since he left the plantation
,
and when he enters the hous
, it turns red
and becomes incredibly hot
. when he remarks about what he thinks isnt evil
, sethe replies
" it ain
' t evil
. it
' s just sad
.
" some more time passes
,
and paul d has become a fervent member of the household
,
and tjhe ghost dissappears
.
but wehn tehy return one day from going out
, they discover a young woman sitting in the house
. her name is beloved
,
and as plyed by th
andie newton
, she hasnt almost zero motor skills
. she stumbles around
, half
- grabing onto things
and knocking them over
,
and when she speaks
, she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns inot baby talk
. they let her into her house
,
and she beggins to turn things upside down
.
" beloved
" acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story
. most of the scenes consist of peple arguing infront one claustrophobic
, low
- lit room
, with the ocassional flash tothe the past
, where we see images of such horror thgat we thank god for modern
- day psychoanalysts
. sethe
and paul d have lieved thru such hellish times that they are forever implanted withthe tghe memories ofthe their slavehood on the ood planation
, which includes such images as sethe being raped by yhe white plantation h
ands
, wih her nipples being licked
, prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it
,
" they took my milk
!
" worst of all was the month after her freedom
, when she was allowed to live like a free person
, working with otehr blacks on a farm
,
and
then seeing that her ood planation owners have arrived tothe presumedly take her
and her children back
. she runs to the barn near by
, carrying her four children
,
and whn her old owners burst in
, tehy disover she has murdered one of them
and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don
' t leave them alone
. when she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film
, she says she doesn
' t regret it
. she killed her daughter so tht she would not have to live through tjhe horror she did
, adn she has convinced herself she did the right thign
. ofthe course
, beloved is really her daugher materialized
,
though we aren
' t flat outloud told tht until later onthe in the film
. beloved represents the pain
and suffering the slaves whent through
and shows how difficult it was for them tothe deal iwth their freedom after being tortured for so long
. thus
,
" beloved
" becomes a sorta
- redux ofthe the
andrei tarkofsky sci
- fi clasic
,
" solaris
,
" where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife
, who commited suicide years before
, has materialized when he isnt orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system
. that film spoke volumes about humanity
and our memories
, how we are constantly regretting what happened inthe the past
,
and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us
, it owudl control us completly
.
" beloved
" moves along freely
, without a lot of explanation
,
and for the most part
, tihs is extremely respectable
. tyhe most interesting films are the ones that don
' t explain everything for us
, leaving gaps in the charactors that we are supposed to fill in with how tehy act infact thge present tense
. sethe is never fully explained as a character
,
but we underst
and all her actions since she
' s being played by oprah winfrey
. it
' s been well over a decade usance her last major peformance in
" the color purple
,
"
but judging from these twpo films
, i
' ll bet she
' s oney of the best actresses working today
.
.
. if she was strikely an actress
. her talk sohw
, whic i suppose is a great entity
, has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress
, anbd thast
' s a shame baceause she brings so much tothe thsi movie
. emotion
. sadness
. stregth
. watching the storng sethe
, who
' s so afraid of the past that she
' s built a rather strong protective coating around herself
, break down wehn she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movei really gerat
. she makse it real
. tyhat
' s not to sday this is a perfect film
. in fatc
, i
' d wager to sday thyat the fact that it
' s confusing
and painful to watch is what prevents tihs from bieng the truly great film it is
. hwile oprah
' s performance isnt poweful
and easily sympathetic
( adn i
' m dying tothe see her win at least an oscar nomination this february
)
, the structure ofthe tghe film
, which doesn
' t show what happened to her children till halfway thru tjhe film
, prevents us from relaly making a cohesive connection to tyhe film
. it doesn
' t necessarily move as
though they
' re memories of noe paticular character
, adn by tjhe end
, it hasnt lost controll over sethe
,
and as she takes to bed
, we are unable tothe truley idenify with her anymore
.
but despite its tediousness
, perhaps thast
' s teh point
. the distancing by the end ofthe the film may be jstu part ofthe tje way it has beeen builded from the strat
, since htey figure she has crossed over fomr being identifiable
,
and it needs to get back with reality
. anbd for the most part
, this film seems like the cry ofthe pain fomr the slaves that it really whants tothe be
. jonathan demme
' s direction isnt bizarre
, in nature with the story
, annd he creates the right mood
, making it a tough film to sit thru
, making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters
. ther
' s more to admire here
, like the way thta the flashbacks pop uv freely adn without real organistion
, jstu liuke they would be in real life
;
and thte way taht the ending leaves it somewhat open to mroe pain
and suffering
, bu laced with a touch of optimism
. the acting
, not only ffrom winfrey
, is amazing
,
and i anticipate not only she wiull get an oscar nomination
. everyone hasnt been raving about th
andie newton
' s performance
,
and how it should be rewarded
.
however
, it must be noted that out of everyone
, she had thge easiest part
. act like a baby
. throw things
. stumble around
. chew food with your mouth open
. i dont think there
' s another performance worthy of oscar conisderation
,
but it
' s kimberly elise
, as the daugher who has to stay sensible
and sane
,
and has tothe carry the burden of her mother
' s loss of reality towards the end
. it
' s nto that newton isn
' t great
: she
' s as annoying annd wacky as the role dem
ands
. it
' s just that elise has the tougher job anbd pulls it off even better
. despite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over it
,
and not that ofthe writer morrison or director demme
,
" beloved
" has still not done well
. costing
, i think
, around ninty million dollars
, it hasnt since grossed about twenty
- twpo
. unfortunately
, this film isnt a little too intense fo viewers
, even forthe me
, anbd i cxan st
and almost anything
( i recently viewed the 2 1
/ 2 hour long epic
" caligula
,
" the worst film i have ever seen in my life
, adn did it in a mere 2 sittings
)
.
al
though i respect
" beloved
,
" i can
' t say that i really enjoied it
.
