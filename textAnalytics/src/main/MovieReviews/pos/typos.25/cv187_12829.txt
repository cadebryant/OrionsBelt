weir is well
- respected infront hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject
- matter into deceptively simple
, powerful films
, the misquito caost
( utopia
)
and fearless
( post
- traumatic stress disorder
) among them
. in tghe truman show
, weir essentialy breathes life into the now
- tired concept of media
- manipulation by tackling the material from the inside
- out
. it certainly helps thta he has an underated performer in top
- form palying thte title charater
, truman burbank
. by nowe you must be aware ofthe the premise
: unbeknownst tothe him
, truman
( carrey
) is hte star of his own tv series
, a 24
- 7 peep
- show in which he isnt surrounded by actors
and placed in loosely scripted situations
; people aroud teh world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuin reactions to fictitious stimulants
.
` seahaven '
, his hometown
,
and the show itself
, are the brainchild ofthe christof
( harris
)
, who presides over his creation in thte base ofthe a fake moon
, directing over 500 cameras
and hundreds of actors
and extras
. for 30 years
, truman suspects nothing
-
` we accept yhe reality we ' re given
, ' poses christof
-
but a desire to break free of tyhe sunny town
adn visit a long lost love in
` fiji '
( mcelhone
, who ws actually an actress fired by christof fo trying to break the confidentiality agreemnt
) overwhelms him
. thus
, christof
and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep thge veneer of seahaven intact
, lest truman discover the world outside
and put an end to tje highly
- rated program
. in a few broad strokes
, weir creates a convincing second
- reality
,
anbd he hasnt the ogod sense nto to bring christof inot the picture until allmost threee
- quarters through
. this allows us to comprehend
and accept truman ' s world before we contextualize it
. fo all his madness
, christof has shown thte world a place without violence
and hardship
,
and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it
. truman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be
, well
, so darn nice
; like a sibling
( or
, perhaps more appropriately
, a caged animal in an interactive zoo
)
, they want to see him succeed
. the surrealistic soap opera is completely plausable thanks to a tight screenplay
and a sympathetic carrey
- he really is an everyman here
, abandoning his facial contortions iin favour of a credible
, wide
- eyed bewilderment
. cinematically
, the truman show is impeccable
, stylishly photographed by peter biziou
adn littered with symbolic images
. as well
, it employs wojciech kilar ' s piece
" zycie za zycie ' masterfully
and beautifuly
. if the film hasnt any flaws
, one may find them in laura linney ' s characterization as meryl
, truman ' s
" wife
"
( i doubt thyat betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone
)
,
annd in a subplot involving truman ' s
` father '
, which feels curiously imcomplete
. there are a fewd stupendous sequences
,
and hte film pulls off a wonderful trick
: we become truman ' s audience as much as the loyal viewers in the film
. tehy wear buttons asking
` how wiull it end
? ' i couldn ' t wait tothe know myself
,
though i didn ' t exactlly want it to end
, for this inspired movie is possibly the best
-
and most complex
- summer picture in years
.
