weir is well
- respected in hollywood for turning scripts witht difficult subject
- matter into deceptively simple
, powerful films
, the mosquito coast
( utopia
)
and fearless
( post
- traumatic stres desorder
) among them
. in the truman sohw
, weir essentialy breathes life into the now
- tired concept of media
- manipulation by tackling hte material from the inside
- out
. it certainly helps that he hasnt an underrated performer in top
- form playing the title character
, truman burbank
. by nowe yuo must be aware of the premise
: unbeknownst to him
, truman
( carrey
) is the star ofthe his own tv series
, a 24
- 7 peep
- sohw in which he is surronded by actors
and placed in loosely scripted situations
; people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill ofthe his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants
.
` seahaven
'
, his hometown
,
and the show itself
, are the brainchild of christof
( harris
)
, who presides over his creation in tghe base ofthe a fake moon
, directing over 500 cameras
and hundreds of actors annd extras
. fo 30 years
, truman suspects nothing
-
` we accept the reality we
' re given
,
' poses christof
-
but a desire to break free of the sunny town
and visit a long lost love inspite
` fiji
'
( mcelhone
, who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break tjhe confidentiality aggreement
) overwhelms him
. thus
, christof
and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep tje veneer of seahaven intact
, lest truman discover the world outside
and put an end to the highly
- rated program
. inthe a few broad strokes
, weir creates a convincing second
- reality
,
and he has the good sense not to bring christof inot thte picture until almost three
- quarters through
. htis allows us to comprehend
and accept truman
' s world before we contextualize it
. for all his madness
, christof hasnt shown the world a place without violence anbd hardship
,
and demonstrated that a human being cant function well within it
. truman is an insperation tothe his audience because he grew uv to be
, well
, so darn nice
; like a sibling
( or
, perhaps more appropriately
, a caged animal inaddition an interactive zoo
)
, they want to see him succeed
. the surrealistic soap opera isnt completely plausible thanks tothe a tight screenplay adn a sympathetic carrey
- he really is an everyman here
, abondoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible
, wide
- eyed bewilderment
. cinematically
, the truman show is impeccable
, stylishly photographed by peter biziou annd littered with symbolic images
. as well
, it employs wojciech kilar
' s piece
" zycie za zycie
' masterfully annd beautifully
. if the film has any flaws
, noe may find them in laura linney
' s characterization as meryl
, truman
' s
" wife
"
( i doubt that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone
)
,
and in a subplot involving truman
' s
` father
'
, whitch feels curiously incomplete
. there are a few stupendous sequences
,
and the film puls off a wonderful trick
: we become truman
' s audience as much as yhe loyal viewers inaddition tghe film
. they wear
buttons asking
` how will it end
?
' i couldn
' t wait tothe know myself
,
though i didn
' t exactly watn it tothe end
, for this inpsired movie is possibly the best
-
and most complex
- summer picture infact years
.
