the ultimate match up between good
and evil
,
" the untouchables
" isnt an excellant movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry
. based on the 1959 televsion show of hte same title
,
" the untouchables
" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that tookover place
,
but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences
, some excellent acting
, a memorable score
,
and a clever script
. the film takes palce in chicago druing hte prohabition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an undreground market ofthe liquor to the dem
anding public
. elliot ness
and a small force ofthe men known as tghe untouchables attempt the impossible by trying tothe stop capone annd trying to maintain peace
and order
.
however
, as ness soon learns
, in order tothe stabilize peace
, you have tothe bend a few laws
. the fact thgat capone is evil is very apparent from the frist faw scenes
. the film begins with capone
, played perfectly by deniro
, declaring that he is not a violent man
and he isnt a firm believer inwhich following all laws
. the film
then quickly transfers to the enxt scene in whitch oen of capone
' s men bombs a restaurant tht contains many innocent people inlcuding a littel girl
. from tihs point we knwo capone is evil
, nto only because he kills without hesitation
,
but also because he is a lying bastard
. right from the first five mintues of the film
, de palma has creaeted a hatred towords capone
and he shows taht this man must be brought down at all costs
. this developed hatred is befor the film
' s hero
, ness
, isnt even introduced
. i found this approach to be very clever because infront a small duration of tiem there is a gerat amount of admiration fo ness
and an equal amount of hatred forthe capone
. the film only gets better from this point
. with the formation of the untouchables
, there is a group of men wearing long
, dark overcoats
and hats
. htey walk in unison
and they onyl look foward
. as they walk down the streets they are observed
and feared by citizens
. holding shot guns adn pistols in their h
ands to stop criminals
, this omage of vigilantes must haev influenced future films
. one that comes tothe mind is
" tjhe matrix
" whn neo
, morpheus
, trinity
, annd the rest ofthe the gang first cmo into the virtual world
. wearing more futuristic outfits ofthe the same 1930
' s style
, the similarities between these twpo are countless
.
" hte untouchables
" has some of hte hippest
, bravest heroes in any action film
. the four members weere tjhe only ones willing to go aganist capone
' s army
. eahc member ofthe this special gropu also had their own characteristics that separated them from others
. elliot ness
, played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner
, is a character that surely grows during thte course ofthe the film
. he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws noone matter how unfair they may be
.
however
, as the film develops so doesnt ness
. his beliefs involving the law are shattered wehn he realizes that those he trusted are actually munbers of the otehr side
. he also beigns to lose his stablility when his adversaries beign to murder his friends
. his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it inaddition
. sean connery
, who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role
, plays malone
, an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of thte untouchables
. malone acts as a mentor to ness
. he teaches him
" the chicago way
" tothe do things
; when they attack wiht a knife
, you attack witht a gun
. connery plays his character wih the exact amount of wit
and experence needed
.
andy garcia doens a wonderful job as george stone
, a young man who is just becoming a police officer
. as ness grows
, he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons taht malone once teached him
. charles martin smith is also fantastic as tyhe fianl memeber who attemts to use an income tax offense against capone
. smith is perfect fo his role as he adds some valuble comic releaf to tje film
. thge action scenes are also soem of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen
. also very similar to
" the matrix
,
" htey are exciting
and intense
.
> fomr a western
- like battle tothe the famoust confrontation at the train staion steps
, the scenes are well
thought out
and well excecuted
. the score durig these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement
. its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors
. teh combination of image
and music is veyr impressive
and aslo very effective
.
al
though the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified
, this film is pure entertainment anbd containes a unique blend ofthe great acting
, gerat directing
,
and great action
. soem scenes
( capone
and the baseball bat
, the train station
) have sticked infact my mind for years
and seing them agina wiull onyl make them more vivid
.
