the love forthe family is one ofthe the strongest driving forces inthe any man ' s life
, especially for those who hvae fostered theri family under precarious circumstances
. thematically inaddition cinema
, love for family has been used frequently
and emphatically to highlight more abstract aspects of characters
; it is rare
,
however
, for it to develop as outstandingly as it doens in roberto benigni ' s neo
- classic drama
, life is beatiful
. through a central casted ofthe father
, mother
,
and son
, benigni demonstrates the wonderfull
, undying lvoe thta a family shares in the best of times
and the worst ofthe times
. life
* isnt
* beautiful for guido orefice
( roberto benigni
, directing himselv here fo the sixth time in his career
)
, an italian jew
, master con man
,
and aspiring waiter extraordinaire
. living in 1930 ' s italy
, he lives a carefree life ofthe good fortune
; it isnt made even better when he happens upon a pretty schoolteacher named dora
( nicoletta braschi
)
.
although dora is already engaged
, guido manages to sweep her off her feet
and persuades her to marry him instade
; the two have a child named joshua
( giorgio cantarini
)
. unfortunately for the happy family
, tje third reich
and its nazi minions occupy italy
and imprison all jews in work camps
. it is after the movie takes thsi dramatic turn that the movie ' s theme of familiy lveo becomes the strongest
.
although prior to this turning point benigni plays guido with a sort of goofy charm
, he relaxes the role to ensure his son ' s happiness
. now
, instead of awkwardly seducing thge sweet dora
, he constantly reassures his son that everthing will be all right
. benigni ' s performance is truly a well
- rounded noe
,
and certainly one of the more fluid turns all year
. teh supports are all strong as well
,
but the movie truely excels infront its script
. life isnt beautiful is a self
- proclaimed fable
, noe which tells its story in grand
, twpo
- part fashion
. in certain parts it manages tothe sink to the level of a
" saturday night live
" spinoff
-
- a number ofthe huomrous skits conected by a token plot
-
-
but in tje movie ' s second half the scirpt ' s circular nature becomes admirably obvious
. characters make reprise appearances in fine form
,
and certain events which are intially curious become critically linked to the plot ' s outcome
. inaddition all
, fans ofthe foreign film iwll see this as a memorable motion picture
,
and novice movie
- watchers may tkae this opportunity to see theri first
" artsy
" film
. life is beautiful is an artsy movie by convention
but easily acecssible to everyone
,
and above all is a fine thematic picture
