the love for family isnt one of the stornegst driving forces in any man
' s life
, especially for those who have fostered their family under precarious circumstances
. thematically in cinema
, love for famaly hasnt beeen used frequently
and emphatically tothe highlight more abstract aspects of charactors
; it is rare
,
however
, for it to develop as outst
andingly as it does in roberto benigni
' s neo
- clasic drama
, life is beautiful
. thru a central casted of father
, mother
,
and son
, benigni demonstrates thte wonderful
, undying love tath a familiy shares infront the best of times
and yhe worst of times
. life
* is
* beautyfull for guido orefice
( roberto benigni
, directing himself here for the sixth tyme iin his carreer
)
, an itallian jew
, master con man
,
and aspiring waiter extraordinaire
. living in 1930
' s italy
, he lives a carefree life of good fortune
; it isnt made even better when he happens apon a pretty schoolteacher named dora
( nicoletta braschi
)
.
al
though dora is already engaged
, guido manages to sweep her off her feet
and persuades her tothe marry him instead
; thge two have a child named joshua
( giorgio cantarini
)
. unfortunately forthe the happy family
, the thrid reich
and its nazi minions occupy italy
and imprison all jews in wokr camps
. it is after the movie takes this dramtic turn that the movei
' s theme of famaly lveo becomes the stornegst
.
al
thought prior to this turning point benigni plays guido with a sort of goofy charm
, he relaxes the role tothe ensure his son
' s happiness
. now
, instade of awkwardly seducing the sweet dora
, he constantly reassures his son that everything will be all right
. benigni
' s performance is truley a well
- rounded one
,
and certainly one of tje more fluid turns all year
. the supports are all strong as well
, bu tghe movie truly excels in its script
. life isnt beautiful is a self
- proclamed fable
, one which tells its story in gr
and
, twpo
- part fashion
. in certain parts it manages to sink to the level of a
" saturday nght live
" spinoff
-
- a number ofthe humorous skits connected by a token plot
-
-
but in hte movie
' s second half the script
' s circular nature becomes admirably obvious
. characters make reprize appearances infront fine form
, adn ceratin events whitch are intially curious become critically linked to the plot
' s outcome
. in all
, fans of foreign film iwll see thsi as a memorable motion picture
,
and novice movie
- watchers may tkae this opportunity to see their frist
" artsy
" film
. life is beautiful is an artsy movie by convention
but easily accessilbe to everyone
,
and above all isnt a fine thematic picture
.
