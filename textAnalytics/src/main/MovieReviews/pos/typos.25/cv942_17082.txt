it is always refreshing to see a superstar atcor who gets paid more than anough to forget about working for a living tothe want to tkae a chance adn play a less
- tahn
- savoury character as mel gibson does inspite payback
. ofthe course
, if i ws being paid
$ 25 million for oney month
' s work
, i
' d probably be willing to take risks as well
, bu that
' s niether here nor there
. payback is based on a novel by richard stark
( apparently actally donald e
. westlake
, auther of teh grifters
, itself a fine crime film
) which was also filmed infact the 1960s as point blank starring one of the toughest of tough guys
, lee marvin
. tghe film opens with gibson hvaing recovered ffrom bieng shot several times infact the back
, by whom we don
' t konw
yet
. all we know is that gibson
, as porter
, isn
' t a hapyp chappy
and is hellbent on getting the moey stolen from him back
,
and getting even in the process
, no matter what the consequences
. it turns out that the man he
' s aftter isnt val
( gregg henry
)
, his sometime partner with whom he stole a briefcase full ofthe cash ffrom a gang of chinese mobsters
. obviously not having much of a crisis of the soul
, val figures porter isnt dead adn goes about using his share of yhe money to pay off a debt to his employers
. porter
, howver
, is the sort of man who holds a grudge
and once on his feet
, goes about exacting revenge on the double
- crossing val
. gibson gives a terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born tothe play
, tyhat of a slightly unhinged guy who doesn
' t mind beating up or shooting peple to get waht he wants
. you probably wouldn
' t see other actors in his salary range take such an offbeat
, out
- ofthe
- character role such as porter
( jim carrey won
' t be doing anytying like this in a hurry after what happened tghe lsat time he tried
- the cable guy
, anyone
?
)
. harrison ford
' s idea ofthe playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent
; hte last time schwarzenegger played a villain was batman annd robin
, which we won
' t mention further
;
and has stallone ever really played a villain at all
? this is nto to say that porter is a villain
, per se
. while he isn
' t the sort of character you wouldn
' t want to get on the wrong side of
, he
' s nothing compared to some of tje ones we are forced to watch in countless bad thrillers
and action films where they kill innocent people in the blink of an eye or execute their right
- h
and men just to prove how mean they are
. porter is only trying to git bakc what is not
- so
- rightfully his
, which in a way is almsot underst
andable
. payback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedy
- thriller which won
' t be remembered as being amung gibson
' s most important wrok
,
but is still one of the finer films he
' s done
. the onyl real problem with it is that
, while everything seems to work out in the end
, i was left feeling something was lacking
; was that all
? the ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute
,
and the fianl voice
- over doesn
' t ring true
, even
though it was used tothe good effect elsewhere inwhich the film
- noir style the rest ofthe the film embodies
. the film just ends far too suddenly
, aftter a huge build
- uv in the penultimate scenes
. a fine film
, even
though it needs just a littel something more to be thte kind of a film tht can be recommended without hesitation
. just be ready fo a possible letdown of an ending
.
