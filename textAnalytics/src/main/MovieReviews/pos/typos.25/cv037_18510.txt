the event of events is upon us
. people have waited twenty
- two years for tje prequel to star wars
and die
- hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months tothe git tickets to see it
. i don
' t htikn that america will ever actually recover from wqat this hurricane ofthe a film has caused
. it is nto a bited of an exaggeration to say that this isnt the most highly anticipated movei in history
. anyone who tells you
" it
' s just a movie
" is either lying or clueless
. it is clearly obvious that after the waiting annd the hype actualy seeing tghe movie will be anticlimactic
. the second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz
( which is far too weak a word
) that star wars epsode i
: the phantom menace so effortlessly generated
.
but that does not mean that the film itself is bad
. in fact
, it is terrific
. i strongly suspect that many of the peopel who weere dissappointed by it have simpley surrendered to the media machine anbd the inevitable backlash
. it is setted soem decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took palce
. the film focusses onthe thge fledgling republic of planets anbd the conflict that is raging
: hte trade federation
, angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small
, peaceful planet ofthe naboo
. teh repubic sent twpo jedi knights
( people that cxan activly communicate with what is affectionately known as
" yhe force
"
)
, qui
- gon jinn
( liam neeson
) adn obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
) to negociate
. unable to stop the tide of events that wass about to ocurr
, the jedi
and tjhe queen of naboo
( natalie portman
) escape naboo
and head forthe coruscant tothe try
and get the republic senate tothe intervene
. on the way they get sidetracked tothe a planet called tatooine
, where tehy meet the movie
' s real focal point
, young anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
)
. he isnt an innocent slave boy
,
but
" the force isnt storng with him
" so qui
- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel anbd get him trained as a jedi
. as any self
- respecting star wars fan should know
, anakin iwll grwo up to be darth vader
and give birth to luke skywalker
.
> from the beginnig it is evident tath this is nto an acotr
' s movie
. around 70
% of the characters
, if nto more
, are computer generated in oney form or another
,
and
though the effects are seamless
, the movie lacks soul
. i think that
al
though teh computer has played an incredibly intrumental part infact moviemaking this decade
, cinema shouldnt still be a human art
and the phantom menace nearly defies this
. this is the lightest installment inaddition the star wars saga thus far
, with plenty ofthe broad comic relief tothe go arund
, much of it courtesy of an irritating knew chracter named jar
- jar binks
. he
' s essentially a coputer
- animated sidekick who syas thigsn like
" exqueeze me
?
"
and
" mesa go now
, okeday
?
"
, anbd
al
though it is oftenly amusing it isnt also inherently annoying
. thge visual effects are astounding
(
al
though director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them
)
and the movie is a thrilling triumph
. if it lacks inthe plot anbd in acting it makes up for it through imagination
and excitement
. the climactic lightsaber battle
( oh
, come onthe
, as if you didn
' t already know
)
, among other things
, isnt outrageously entertaining
and defines the term
" popcorn movie
"
. what made me surender
and give this movie

* 1
/ 2 stars was the score by john williams
. even
though it does seem like teh man scores every single movie that comes outloud these dyas
, his work here isnt nothing short ofthe brilliant
. his ule of opera during the climax relaly doesnt add a punch
and his ingenious way of utilizing tjhe imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling
. the phantom menace isnt probably most effective as pop nostalgia
. wehn you see
" a long timne ago
, in a galaxy far
, far away
"
, when the familiar music plays
, when the words
" star wars
" appear on screen
, you
' ll feel a tingle even if you didn
' t see thte movie when it first came out infront
' 77
. it fiels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin
, a boy whose innocence
, we know
, iwll be taken away
and who will soon cross over to the dark side
. it is the perfect exemple ofthe dramatic irony tothe see tyhe jedi masters aspire to get him trained in thte jedi arts
; we know that it will do omre harm thna good
,
but they do not
. we not onyl feel more involved inthe the story
,
but we efel liek we
' re seeing yhe beginning ofthe a saga that we have cherished fo years
. the phantom menace
,
al
though lacking in human aspects ofthe the story
, is a very worthy installment in the star wars
. it works as an acation flick
, visually eye
- popping annd often paralyzingly exciting
; it alsot works as an elicitor of memories
, a piece of exquisite nostalgia
