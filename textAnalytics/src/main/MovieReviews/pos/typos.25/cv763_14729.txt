your friends
and neighbors is a rather bazare film about 6 people
, who hop in
and out of bed wiht each other
. written
and directed by neil labute
, who ' s first film
,
" inspite the company of men
" was simpley marvelous
, disappoints a bit here with this one
. the story involves two couples
( ben stiller
& catherine keener
annd aaron eckhart
& amy brenneman
)
, an artist assistant
( nastassja kinski
)
,
and an egotistical women abuser
( jason patric
)
. the character ' s names are not apparent
and are not mentioned in hte entire movie
. each of the characters has their pwn sexual style
and they don ' t seem to
" morge
" together well
. so the group experiments behind their respective partners back
. there are some hysterical scenes
, one involves jason patric
, aaron eckhart
,
and ben stiller ' s characters
. they are all in a sauna
, talking baout their best
" lay
"
, when jason patric ' s character makes a surprising confession
. the whole scene is hilarious
adn exceptionally well written
and acted
. the enjoyed this movei
,
although it seemed a tad lengthy
( even
though it only runs 99 min
.
)
. the film ' s cast is exceptional with oscar caliber performances by catherine keener
, aaron eckhart
,
and jason patric
. i would not reccomend this film
, to peopel who are offended by conversations that are very sexually explicit
. it doed seem to offend people
, more than half of the people in tjhe theater left durring the film
.
although your friends
annd neighbors doesn ' t have the power ofthe labute ' s earlier film it still manages tothe be somewhat intertaining
and funny
, while maintaining a melancholy philisophy onthe human relationships
.
