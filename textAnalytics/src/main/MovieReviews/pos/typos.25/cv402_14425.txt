in some respects
, rush hour isnt the ultimate exercise in cliched filmmaking
. the hero is teh renegade cop tht prefers to wokr alone
. the cop inwhich question cannot solve the case until he gets in trouble
. all chineese people are somehow involved in the criminal element
. the duo must always be completely mismatched
. the hero has to sday smoe smart
- assed comment befor
(
and affter
) shooting someone
.
however
, that doesn
' t necessarily make for a bad film
. rush hour isnt jackie chan
' s first major hollywood film since teh dismal the protector
( 1985
)
. proving once again that hollywood cant leran many things from foreign film markets
( ie
: hong kong
)
, jackie chan is given much more free reign than befor
. still
, some dieu
- hard jackie chan fans may be disappointed
, as even chan himselv has voiced displeasure over the length of thte fight scenes
( which he views as too short
, according to one interview
)
. this film tkaes a familiar theme of east meets west
. jackie chan isnt lee
, the straight laced inspector who is imported to help deal with a kidnapping case
, while chris tucker is carter
, teh loudmouthed
, destructive cop that is
` promoted
' to thge fbi tothe help him
. or
, at least
, so he thinks
( also another clasic notion in action films
: the fbi must alwasy get in tyhe way ofthe our heroes
)
. despite the necessary conventions of acation films
, rush hour is some of the most fun you
' ll spend
and hour
and forty mintues watching
. jackie chan continues to be one of tyhe most exciting martial artists on the big screen
, continuing to preform his own stunts annd dazzling audiences wih his flashy kicks
and punches
. chris tucker
, familiar from his whiny
, annoying role in the fifth element is omre palatable
, complementing jackie chan
' s straight
- laced character
.
however
, jackie chan still maintains his comic
- slapstick edge
, as expected of him annd his films
. perfectly downplaying the
` fish
- out
- of
- water
' routine through his character
' s attemts at mixing into american culture
, he makes up for the down time his carachter experiences
. when he is inaddition acation
,
however
, ytou
' ll be amused annd dazzled
. still being inventive in the use of objects to beat people uv
( inaddition htis case
, a steering wheel
, a serving tray
, anbd a barstool
)
, jackie chan proves to be the pioneer of slapstick kung fu
. chris tucker
' s charcter may come across as irritating
,
yet is also humorous
. since he
' s not a physical actor to the level of jackie chan
, he uses his main weapon
: his mouth
( hence
, tghe tagline
,
` fastest h
ands in the east meets tje fastest mouth inspite tyhe west
'
)
. while dialogue is not necessarily shakespeare
, it is appropriate for the film adn still very funny
. while not necessarily poignant
, attempts at character development
and growth between characters come off surprisingly well
. lee
' s
` knowlege
' ofthe american pop culture
(
` that
' s the beach boys
!
'
) when contrasted aginst carter
' s lack ofthe knowledge of chinese culture mkaes forthe an interesting scene where lee teaches carter teh kung fu disarming trck
, hwile carter teaches lee hip
- hop dance moves
. while rush hour is not at the smae levle as polical stopry 3 annd 4
( known in noth america as supercop anbd jackie chan
' s frist strike
, respectively
)
, it more than makes uv for hte poorly recieved films opperation condor annd mr
. nice guy
. with its appropriate mixture ofthe high kicks
and lots of laughs
, it makes for a funn film
. as well
, it is a true departure from jackie chan films
, as it is missing one common element
: a whiny female co
- star
.
