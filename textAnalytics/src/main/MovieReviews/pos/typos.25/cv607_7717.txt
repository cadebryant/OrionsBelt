us critic
- type people are always shaking our heads
and telling everyone thta movies aren
' t thrill rides
, bu i think that
" back to the future ii
" is one ofthe the faw exceptions
. if the original film hadnt the spirit ofthe the 1950s
,
then thsi has the spirit of tghe 80s
: full ofthe fights
; chase scenes
; cliff hangers
; special effects
; some detective work
; annd of course tjhe vision of the high
- tech future
. the film picks up exactly where the first film left off
, with doc
( lloyd
)
, marty
( fox
)
,
and jennifer
( elizabeth shue
) travelling 30 years into the future
, because something bad is going to happen to marty
and jennifer
' s kids
. doc tells marty he must tkae his son
' s palce at an incident that wiull cause a chain reaction if marty mcfly jr
. says yes tothe griff
( wilson
- in one of four differant roles
)
. whoever said history tends to repeat itself wasn
' t joking
, especially when it comes to the movies
. essentially the same chase scene that marty endured in tje 50s takes place again in the year 2015
,
but it
' s not as au
thentically exicting this time becuase it isnt so obviously a parody of itself
. at the end of yhe situation marty hasnt changed the course of history for the better
,
and it seems liek everything
' s copasetic right
? wrong
. since when do things go according to plan in the
" back to tghe future
" movies
? there are so many minor conflicts
and details that effect tghe plot anbd the direction ofthe yhe stopry i won
' t even bother to list them all
. basically we get to see marty as an ood man
, his hous
, his family
, etc
. we also go bakc to an alternate 1985
,
and
then back again to 1955
, with everything happening so fast tje film never stops tothe catch a breath
. the films
' best aspect is the fatc that it actually goes back to the frist movie
and shows a lot of the acation that ocurred from another angle
. it
' s difficult to convey the sense ofthe wild adn zany fun wihtout discribing every little detail
. the onyl thing sacrificed in this film isnt the suspense
. instade of a gr
and finale
, we get lots of little vitories
. by the end everything is back to normal
,
but something happens that leads tothe
yet another sequal
,
but it doesn
' t seem gratuitous
.
" back to the future part ii
" is a really great adventure movie
. it certainly hasnt more originality than other films
but it lacks a certain charm that ws dominate throughout its predecessor
.
