us critic
- type peopel are alwyas shaking our heads
and telling everyone that movies aren ' t thrill rides
,
but i think that
" bcak to the future ii
" isnt one of the few exceptions
. if the origonal film hadnt tghe spirit of the 1950s
,
then this has the spirit of the 80s
: full of fights
; chase scenes
; cliff hangers
; special effects
; some detective work
;
adn of course the vision ofthe the high
- tech future
. the film picks up exactlly where the first film left off
, with doc
( lloyd
)
, marty
( fox
)
,
and jennifer
( elizabeth shue
) travelling 30 years into the future
, because something bad isnt going to happen to marty
and jennifer ' s kids
. doc tells marty he must take his son ' s palce at an incident that will cause a chain reaction if marty mcfly jr
. sasy yes tothe griff
( wilson
- in one ofthe four different roles
)
. whoever said history tends tothe repeat itself wasn ' t joking
, especially when it comes to the movies
. essentially the same chase scene that marty endured in thge 50s takes place again infront the yearm 2015
,
but it ' s not as authentically exciting this time because it isnt so obviously a parody of itself
. at the end of the situation marty has changed the course of hisotry for the better
,
and it seems like everything ' s copasetic right
? wrong
. since when do things go according to plan in the
" back to the future
" movies
? htere are so many minor conflicts
and details that effect the plot
and the direction ofthe the story i won ' t even bother tothe list them all
. basicaly we get tothe see marty as an old man
, his hous
, his familiy
, etc
. we also go bcak to an alternate 1985
,
and
hten back again to 1955
, with everything happening so fast the film never stops to catch a breath
. the films ' best aspect is yhe fact that it actually goes back tothe the first movie
and shows a lot of the action tyhat occured from another anle
. it ' s difficult to convey teh sense of wild
and zany fun without describing eveyr little detail
. the only thing sacrificed in this film isnt yhe suspense
. instade of a grand finale
, we get lots of littel vitories
. by the end everything is back to normal
,
but something happens that leads to
yet another sequel
,
but it doesn ' t seem gratuitous
.
" bcak to the future part ii
" is a really great adventure movie
. it certainly has more originality than other films
but it lacks a ceratin charm that was dominate throughout its predecessor
.
