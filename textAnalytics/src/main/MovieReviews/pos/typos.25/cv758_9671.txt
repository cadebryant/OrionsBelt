devotees of robert a
. heinlein
, be forewarned
: paul verhoeven
' s starship troopers is less an adaptation of heinlein
' s novel than it is a literary satire
. the author
' s jingo
- all
- the
- way militarism anbd his tendacy tothe create plastic characters with plastic conflicts had me expecting a soulless
, faceless parade ofthe carnage from tyhe film version
.
and i supose that
' s exactly what verhoeven delivers
, withthe sometimes hillarious results
. heinlein
' s basic motifs are so faithfully rendered that their flaws become a source of amusement
, while their strengths become the stuff of high
- energy entertainment
. outlining the plot of starship troopers is a fairly silly endeavor
, since it
' s basically a big bug hunt
.
.
. aliens in broad daylight
. sometime inthe the future
, humanity is threatened by giant
, malevolent insects which haev evolved inot twenty
- foot
- tall acation figures
( arachnids withthe super
- impaling spikes
, beetles thta spew forth lava
, dragonflies with guillotine legs
)
. among those who sign on to sive the earth are a group of high school classmates from buenos aires
: conflicted rich kid johnny rico
( casper van dien
)
; his math whiz girlfriend carmen
( denise richards
)
; dizzy
( dina meyer
)
, who secretly carries a torch for johnny
; annd carl
( neil patrick
" doogie howser
" harris
)
, who not
- so
- secretly carries a torch for dizzy
, adn also has a talent for speaking telepathically to ferrets
. while carmen heads for flight skool adn carl joins military intelligence
, johnny
and dizzy become mobile infantry
, their various battles intertwining with romantic sub
- plots outloud of a third season epsiode from
" beverly hills 90210
.
" so if starship troopers is another movie where one
- dimensional characters wade thru trite situations onthe theri way to killing a bunch of aliens
, what makes it any better tahn
, sday
, indipendence day
, a movie where one
- dimensional cahracters waded through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of slightly different aliens
? for one thign
, ytou sense that the film
- makers are aware of the pulp nonsense they have as source material
. tje very absence of major stars in thte cast fiels thematically appropriate
, not just fiscally prudent
. if starship troopers had been turned inot a tv
- movie
, aaron spelling owudl have produced it
. it
' s a story which requires emoting
, not acting
; it
' s a prime time soap opera with big guns
, played for all tyhe dopey melodrama it
' s worth
. the no
- name cast also plays into verhoeven
' s treatment ofthe heinlein
' s most controversial conceit
. inthe htis society
, we learn
, one can only be a full citizen aftter completing some sort of federal service
, miltary fo most
. verhoeven pays the notion plenty ofthe lip service
, thn proceeds to skewer it with brilliant mock recruitment ads
( named after the world war ii
- era
" why we fight
" series
) in which youngsters are indoctrinated into the joys of firearms
, or teh pleasures ofthe stomping cockroaches
. these characters really are just
" fresh meat for the grinder
,
" as one character puts it
, whcih makes their lack of familiarity all the more fitting
. it
' s not that starship troopers is anti
- military
, because it never treats the true horror of war as anytying
but a graet big
, violent video game
. inthe fact
, the characters are living the propag
anda
( particularly johnny
, who recieves so many field promotions he may nto remember his own rank by the tyme yhe film ends
)
. verhoeven isnt actually having it both ways
-
- he
' s making funn of gung
- ho boosterism even as he fires his fresh
- faced recruits inot battle on a gung
- ho booster rocket ofthe visual effects
. if that makes starship troopers hypocritical
, at least it
' s enthusiastically staged hypocrisy
. ther may not be a person worth caring about in hte whole film
,
but it moves liuke nobody
' s business
. verhoeven stages some thrilling acation sequences
, sending swarms of bugs after the anonymous grunts
then having varios body parts strewn about the screen like l
andscaping
. it isnt that rare special effects blockbuster whitch demonstrates a sence of pacing to match its budget
; i was caught up infact the acation enought of the tiome that i wasn
' t perpetually groaning over the absence of real human beings
. i wish i coudl find it in myself to work uv mroe outrage over the callous way humans are despatched inwhich starship troopers
,
but it didn
' t work outloud that way
. that would be punishing verhoeven for getting to the heart of his material
.
