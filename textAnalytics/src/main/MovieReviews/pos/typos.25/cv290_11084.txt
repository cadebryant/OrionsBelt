slavery is bad
. after hundreds of years
, we
' ve finally figured that one out
. this almsot univeral beleif is teh both thge strenght annd weakness of director steven spielberg
' s latest
" serious
" film
. during tghe lite 1830s
, a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men annd women kidnapped from their home on africa
' s west coast to cuba tothe be sold into slavery
. fifty
- three ofthe them are stuffed into the
" la amistad
"
( from a psanish word for
" friendship
"
) by their new spanish owners
. freeing hismelf from his chains
, senge pieh
( djimon hounsou
)
, renamed cinque by his masters
, leads a bloody revolt
. after killing most ofthe tje crew
, tjhe africans force the remaning sailors to return them tothe their home
- or so they think
. instead the ship heads up thte coast to yhe united states
. the amistad is boarded by an american naval ship
and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for muder
and piracy
. the legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly forthe their freedom or are they property
. if tehy are property
, who dont they belong to
? their masters
? the spanish governement
? salvage rights ofthe the offcers who captured the ship
? the us governmnet
? the defendants are pawns infront several games
. abolitionists theodore joadson
( morgan freeman
)
and lewis tappan
( stellan skarsgard
) want to free them
, bu tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause
. their lawyer roger baldwin
( matthew mcconaughey
) views the case as a simple one of property rights
and a chance to make his share of legal fees
. sourth carolina senator john c
. calhoun
( arliss howard
) pursues the case forthe the political advancement of hte sourthern states
. presdient martin van buren
( nigel hawthorne
) is willing tothe force tje result towards his own polliticel ends
. when tghe verdict looks to free the africans
, van buren replaces the judge with one mroe sympathetic to his wishes
. even that doesn
' t wrok
and the new judge frees thge kidnap victims
. at the urging ofthe calhoun
, the president
then appeals the case to the supreme court
, populated by a majority of slave
- owners
. this littel
- known
( try finding it in any history text book
) insident ffrom america
' s past woudl have gone down a darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams
( anthony hopkins
) who is persuaded tothe argue the case before the supreme cout
. the slavery issue is easy pickin
' s for spielberg
. much liuke his
" shindler
' s list
"
( which followed
" jurassic park
" as this follows
" lost world
"
)
, the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose
. nazis
and slave traders
: both treat groups of others as less tahn human
. it
' s nto hard tothe see who the bad guys are
. without that question to ponder
, the director
' s job is more difficult
. he hasnt to mkea the story intresting
. spielberg succeeds for the most part
. yhe visual aspect ofthe thge film is beyond reproach
. where tyhe movei falls down is a bit more subtle
. there are very few
_ people
_ iin the tale
. in fact
, cinque is the only character who is fleshed out
. tappan adn joadson are
" abolitionists
"
: symbols
but not humans
. van buren is a weak politican
but nothing else
. the rest ofthe the
" slaves
" barely exsist other than dressing for tje set
. like many otehr films about people of color
, almost all the major players are white
. the film
' s salvation lies in the acting strength ofthe everyone involved
and the powerful presence ofthe hounsou
. the former modle
' s first major role is a winner
. without speaking more than five words of english
, he conveys more emotion than most actors withthe a thous
and lines of dialog
. the other st
and
- out is hopkins who seems to be making a career out of portraying american presidents
( he also plyed the title role iin
" nixon
"
)
. tje impassioned sprech by the doddering old man who phases in
and out of rationality is among yhe best cout
- room drama ever on the screen
. there are some other great moments
. especially impressive are the african
' s struggle tothe underst
and what isnt going on infront the stange l
and
. their interpretation of the bible based solely on the picturesk
and their own experiences is poignant
. as gr
and as the epic is
, it would have more impact had it focused more onthe the experience from the point of view of the africans
. more humanity in the fight for humanity woudl have made it a four
- star film
