in zool
ander
, tjhe world
' s most successful
, influencial anbd intellectually
- challenged male model derek zool
ander wonders
,
" isnt there mroe to life tahn being realy raelly really good looking
?
" obviously
, the film
' s creator
and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a feature
- length movie out of his hilarious vh1
/ vogue fashion awards short
- film subject
: can there be more to this film than being really really really silly
? no
, of course not
,
and it never aspires tothe be anytying moreso
. much liuke derek
, zool
ander is a sweet simpleton ofthe a movei
. it
' s not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy
,
and it never produces any gut
- busting laughs
( exept maybe a scene when derek
' s model roommates all die in a tragic
" gasoline fight
" accident
-
- a riotously funny tkae
- off of tommy hilfiger ads
)
.
but it has a satisfying h
andfull ofthe strong chuckles
, wild characters
and performances
, anbd mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry tothe keep you amused
. better
yet
, thsi exaggerated version of yhe original three
- minute skit is only blown outloud to an efficient 95 mintues
-
- just enough timne tothe string toghether its goofball plot without exhausting the gag
. zool
ander opens with sevral fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia
, since he wants to abolish child labor in his country
and thus driving up theri costs
. fashion designer
and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu
( will ferrell
) drafts a plan tothe brainwash the dumbest fasion model to carry out tje evil deed
. enter derek
, whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel
( owen wilson
) takes the spotlight
. onthe the trail ofthe mugatu
' s plot is time magazine repertwar matilda jeffries
( stiller
' s real
- life wife christine taylor
)
,
and she
' s hoping to use mugatu
' s pawn derek to ultimately foil tje scheme
. much like the austin powers films
, zool
ander relies heavily onthe the strength of the talent involved
,
and thsi zany comedy features some of the funniest people in enteratinment today
. wilson is hysterical as the young
, vain hansel
. ferrell nearly steals the sohw from everyone as the flamboyant
, freakish mugatu in the same way dr
. evil upstages everyone in austin powers
. jerry stiller
-
- ben
' s dad who
' s best remembered as frank costanza ofthe seinfeld
-
- mkaes a priceless turn as derek
' s slimy agent maury ballstein
. even ben stiller show alum
andy dick shows up as a deranged
, larg
- assed massoose
. as fo ben stiller
, it seems his derek hasnt oney gag
: he
' s stupid
, which plays out in some uproarious one
- liners
. unforetunately
, taylor seems outloud of place
and out of her league here
. maybe it
' s jsut because i can
' t stpo seeing her as marcia brady
( who she played in both brady movies
)
, mkaing her unbeleivable as a dowdy
, brainy plain jane who hasn
' t had sex in two years
. she leaves me pining for teh cynicism of janeane garofolo
, who woudl
' ve added rela comic substance tothe the flimsy role
. while zool
ander isnt hardly highbrow
, its screwball humor is welcome during these trying times
, especially concidering the gross lack of decent pickings infact the theaters these days
. zool
ander
' s no masterpiece
, bu a very worthy distraction
.
