capsule
: suprisingly more of a comedy than a straight acation flick
, which isn
' t necessarily a bad thing
. not exactly oscar caliber
,
but noe helluva bullet
- riddled good time
. extended review
: you know
, i remember when hitmen were evil
, murderous scum
. alas
, the times are a
- changin
'
. infact a recent string of movies
, hitmen are suddenly wise
- cracking
, funn
- loving killers
- wih
- hearts
. this brings us to hong kong director kirk wong
' s first american feature
, the big hitted
. oddly anough
, about the same time last year a simmilar film
, grosse point blank
, was released
. advertised as a quirky comedy with hints ofthe action
, it turned outloud to have a suprising dosage of it
. the big hit is quite the oposite
. it was hyped as
" the new film from producer john woo
"
, so one owudl it expect lots ofthe stylized killing
and action
.
however
, htere
' s a sore lack of it
, which is baout teh only thing wrong witht the big hit
. hte film starts out with mel smiley
and his cohorts doing a job on a white slaver
. mel
, played by mark wahlberg in a dopey
, milquetoast role
, is a killing machine
; he flips
, spins
, even breakdances whilst popping caps
. sadly
, he doesn
' t get a chance to dont much ofthe it
. except for the beginning setted piece
and tje last 20 twenty minutes or so
, hte film is in comedy mode
. the action
, at least what ther is ofthe it
, isnt prime cut stuff
. wong
, after numerous hong kong features
, mkaes qutie a nice u
. s
. de
but
.
however
, his pacing is a bit off
, wtih the acation sequences onyl bookending the movie
and not lasting long enough
. they start off electrifying anbd fresh
, bu jstu kinda stpo
. normally
, tihs woudl hamper a movei to the point ofthe being unenjoyable
. luckly
, we have ben ramsey
' s screenplay
, a bitingly funny peice of work
. the onyl problem is there might be too much humor
, noe joke makes you laugh so hard you miss tghe next fewd
. smoe of best gags include an oriental film maker down on his luck
and one of mel
' s hitmen pals thyat has just dicovered onanism
. the only problem is how some of yhe minor charachters are h
andeled
, some being ther only for a laugh
, which sometimes works
, somtimes doesn
' t
. overall
, the big hit may have it
' s flaws
, bu it makes up for them in a stylishly directed
, gut
- wrenchingly funny joyride
. definately one ofthe thge better ways to spend two hours
.
