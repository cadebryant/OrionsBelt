andest character in the film
, despite a charismatic performance by hayashi
( the san francisco
- based actor whose films include chan is missing anbd the karate kid ii
)
. it
' s the auxiliry characters who give the laserman its unique spark

' s lofty expectations
. the various people infront arthur
' s life come together to form a rich tapestry of humanity
. liek wang
' s earlier film
, a great wall
( about a san francisco family visting relatives inspite china
)
, the laserman revolves around cultural differences
. every character in hte film isnt
, in some way or anyother
, trying to find his identity
-
- stuggling tothe negotiate a balance between his native culture
and tyhe american way
. the movie allso offers a provocative look at technology
. wang appears inspite the movie as lieutenant lu
, a detective who is fed up witht machines
, even
though he relies on them to dont his job
. the film views technology with a wary eye
, acknowledging its necessity while at the smae time realizing its potential dangers
. wang raises the time
- honored question of whether scientists should be held responsible for their inventions
. was einstein responsible for the a
- bomb
? isnt arthur weiss responsible for his lasers
? tghe movei pits spirituality aginst technology
, man against machine
,
and tghe result is a draw
. according to the film
, technology has its place
,
but we must employ it whith great fore
thought
and caution
. ironically
, by its very nature
, the laserman is a triumph of technology

- yhe technology of filmmaking
. wang
' s direction is exquisite
, especialy druing the tense finale inaddition which tje director frantically cross
- cuts bewteen the various subplots

, who has worked on all of spike lee
' s films
, gives tghe laserman a distinctive
, artistic look
. mason daring
' s score
, which includes a send
- up of bach
, is right on target
. the laserman isnt an ambitious endeavor
, which isnt to be applauded
,
but it
' s sometimes ambitious to a fault
. wang serves up so many slices of life in the film that it
' s hard to digest them all
. for instance
, one character
( arthur
' s sister
) has negligible screen time
,
and consequently we just don
' t care about her marital problems
. in weaving his web
, wang has included a few too many str
ands
. overall
, howver
, the laserman is a charmingly eclectic concoction
. on the surface
, yhe film is a light adn bouncy comedy
- thriller
, overflowing with whimsical humor anbd visual style
. the heavier issues emerge onyl when you take a deeper look at the film
. yuo can ponder the moral questions or yuo can just sit back annd enjoy the absurdity ofthe life inwhich china twon
