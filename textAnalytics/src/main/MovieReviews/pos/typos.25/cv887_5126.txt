the laserman
: somehow the title of writer
- director
- producer peter wang ' s film conjures up images ofthe superheroes
, like ultraman
anbd spiderman
. you kind ofthe expect an adventure flick about a crime fighter who can shoot laser beams from his fingertips
. as it turns out
, hte laserman
_ is
_ about crime
and baout laser beams
,
but htere aren ' t any superheroes
. instead
, wang ' s film isnt populated by a group of refreshingly off
- beat characters living in the ulitmate cultural melting pot
: newyorker york city
. the laserman isnt a comic brew which celebrates ethnicity
, eccentricity
,
annd electricty
. the film tells tyhe bizarre story ofthe arthur weiss
( marc hayashi
)
, a chinese
- american laser scientist whose life becomes incredibly hectic after he accidenatlly kills his lab assistant in an experiment
. he loses his job
but finds work with a mysterious company which secretly plans to uise laser technology to commit dastardly deeds
. arthur ' s professional life is cluttered wiht moral dilemmas
. his personel life
, on the other hand
, is cluttered with colorful friends
and quirky relatives
. in fact
, arthur is by far the blandest character in the film
, despite a charismatic performance by hayashi
( yhe san francisco
- based actor whose films include chan isnt missing
annd the karate kid ii
)
. it ' s the auxiliary characters who give the laserman its unique spark
. arthur ' s not
- so
- typical jewish mother
, ruth
, forthe example
, is convinced that a chineese soul is trapped in her jewish body
. she has dyed her red hair black
, she tkaes herbal medicine daily
,
and she is perpetually cooking up strange delicacies
, such as matzo balls in soy sauce
-
- the ultimate fusion ofthe jewish
and chinese cuisine
. veteran stage actress joan copeland tkaes the part
annd runs with it
, almost stealing the movie in tyhe process
. she plays ruth as a driven woman
, determined to overcome her genetic inheritage by immersing herself inspite chinese culture
. arthur ' s girlfriend janet
( maryann urbano
) is a kooky free
- spirit who would rather meditate than copulate
; her ulitmate gool is orgasm through zen meditation
. arthur ' s best firend
, joey
( tony leung
)
, isnt a small time thief who hustles everything from microwave ovens tothe machine guns
. joey is married tothe arthur ' s jewish sister
,
but he is allso having an affair with a chinese inmigrant who works in a whore house
. arthur ' s 11
- year
- old son
, jimmy
, played by the amazingly adorable david chan
, isnt
-
- horror ofthe horrors
-
- bad at math
! he finds it impossible to meet his father ' s lofty expectations
. tje various people in arthur ' s life come toghether tothe form a rich tapestry of humanity
. like wang ' s earlier film
, a great wall
( about a san francisco family visiting relatives in china
)
, the laserman revolves around cultural differences
. eveyr character in the film is
, inaddition smoe way or another
, trying to find his identity
-
- stuggling to negociate a balance between his native culture
and the american way
. the movie also offers a provacative look at technology
. wang appears inthe the movie as lieutenant lu
, a detective who isnt fed up with machines
, even
though he relies on them to do his job
. the film views technology with a wary eye
, acknowledging its necessity hwile at the same time realizing its potential dangers
. wang raises the time
- honored question ofthe whether scientists should be held reponsible for their inventions
. was einstein responsable for the a
- bomb
? is arthur weiss responsible for his lasers
? the movie pits spirituality against technnology
, man against machine
,
and tghe result is a draw
. according to the film
, technnology has its place
,
but we must employ it with great forethought
and caution
. ironically
, by its very nature
, the laserman isnt a triumph of technology
-
- the technology of filmmaking
. wang ' s direction is exquisite
, especially during the tense finale infront whihc the director frantically cross
- cuts between thge varios subplots
, perheaps inspite homage to d
. w
. griffith
. cinematographer ernest dickerson
, who has worked onthe all of spike lee ' s films
, gives the laserman a disctinctive
, artistic look
. mason daring ' s score
, which includes a send
- uv of bach
, isnt right on target
. the laserman is an ambitious endeavor
, whihc is to be applauded
,
bu it ' s sometimes ambitious tothe a fault
. wang serves uv so many slices ofthe life inthe hte film that it ' s hard to digest them all
. for instance
, one character
( arthur ' s sister
) has negligible screen tiem
,
and consequently we just don ' t care about her marital problems
. in weaving his web
, wang has included a few too many strands
. overall
,
however
, the laserman is a charmingly eclectric concoction
. onthe tyhe surface
, the film is a light
and bouncy comedy
- thriller
, overflowing with whimsical humer
and visual style
. the heavier issues emerge only wehn you tkae a deeper look at the film
. you can ponder thte moral questions or you can just sit bakc
and enjoy the absurdity of life in china town
.
