. hte film covers 6 pm to midnight
. the main charactor is patrick played by david mckellan who also wrote
and directed
.
- reminiscent of on the beach
.
but much more so of a story richard matheson wroet
,
" thte last day
.
"
( p
. s
. on rereading the 1953 matheson
, this film is almost a loose adaptation of that tsory
. teh similarities may be mere coincidence
,
but they are numerous
and they are very striking
.
)
- us release may be problematical
. the title is lacklustre
and non
- memorable
,
though very appropriate when you know about the film
. also provincial americans may not care about tjhe end of the world comming to toronto
