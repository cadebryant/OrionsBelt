(
though i feel it would likely be pg
, forthe martial
- arts violence
.
) iwth three movies aleady
( re
) released theatrically infront america
, anbd at least three more on theri way
, jackie chan is one of the newest
" hot properties
" in action adventure stardom
,
and it
' s just baout time
. forthe over twenty
- five years
, jackie
' s beeen starring in martial arts
and action movies in hong kong
, thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp ofthe acrobatics
and martial arts
and a wonderful sense of comedy
.
" drunken master
" has the distinction ofthe being hte first jackie chan movie to
" mkea it big
"
-
- this isnt the movie that suposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong
. i
' m not entirely sure why
, exactly
. in many ways
,
" drunken master
" isnt similar to most of jackie
' s other early films
, such as
" fearless hiena
" i
and ii
,
" master wtih cracked fingers
"
,
" half a loaf of kung fu
"
,
" spiritual kung fu
"
,
and others
. in fact
, looking at all these early films together
, one gets the impression that tehy were stamped out
, cookie
- cutter style
, at a rate of four to six per year
, all useing the same casts
and telling very similar stories
. tothe be honest
, i tihkn that early jackie chan movies are something ofthe an adquired tast
. they
' re quite different from action movies as we know them in amercia
. theese films tend to be set in the chineese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past
, with fairly slow plots thta oftenly me
ander far afield adn sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy
and fight scenes together
.
" drunken master
"
,
though its plot is tighter than some
, is no exception
.
( as an asside
,
" drunken master
" was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw
, adn i saw it the way it was meant to be seen
.
.
. in a movei theather in seattle
, as part of an asian film festival
. at the time
, i didn
' t really think it was anytying special
.
.
.
but after having seen more films like it
, it
' s kind of grown on me
.
)
" drunken master
"
' s storyline is very similiar to that of otehr eary jackie chan movies
, such as
" fearless hyena
" i annd ii
and
" master with cracked fingers
"
-
- slacker martial arts student is tought the martial arts by a harsh
- seeming master
, adn has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end
( a formula that has been
" adapted
,
" tothe put it kindly
, by american films such as karate kid
)
. more specifically
, jackie chan plays the part of wong fei
- hong
, aka
" naughty panther
,
" a fun
- loving
, practical
- joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good
, bu not
_ quite
_ good enough
. after embarrassing his instructor
' s assistant by beating him roundly
,
then beating uv a bully in a marketplace
, wong fei
- hong tries to hitted onthe a pretty girl
,
but dicovers that she
,
and her mother
, can hit bcak
, better than he can
.
.
.
and is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin anbd aunt
, respectively
. his father
, wong kei
- ying
, is unahppy about this
,
and is further anoyed when the father
and brother of the bully show up to sue fo damages
. kei
- ying soon institutes a harsh regimen ofthe punishment
, which fei
- hong does not like at all
. while escaping from this punishment
, fei
- hong meets up with a drunken old man
, who proceeds to thrash him soundly
, hten take him on as a student
and thrash him some more
. tihs turns out tothe be su hua
- chi
, a legendary master of drunken
- sytle kung fu
. he assigns fei
- hong a series ofthe bizzare tasks
, such as filling jugs iwth water hwile hanging upside down from a frome
, cracking walnuts with his h
ands
,
and otehr such exercises
, thta seem like moreso pointless cruelty bu are actually strenghtening him up
.
then
, when he
' s ready
, he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu
. unfortunately
, the lazy fei
- hong only practices six of them
.
.
.
" drunken master
" features some wonderfull martial arts sequences
, with jackie winning smoe fights
and losing others
. it
' s been said befoer
, bu i
' ll say it again
-
- these fights don
' t jstu
_ happen
_
, they
' re as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance
, adn it shows
. in his fights
, jackie oftenly makes use of objects found in his environment
-
- benches
, jugs
, cups
, bowls
, fruits
and vegetables
-
- often in new
and surprising ways
. the fight scenes
, particularily those toward the end ofthe the film
, are unparallelled in most american films
. whether jackie wins or loses
, it
' s really something to see
.
.
. adn it
' s often as funny as anytying
, too
. adn funny is the other thing jackie chan is very
, very good at
. htere
' s very littel that
' s new in this movie
-
- jackie winning fights
, jackie getting beaten badly by a master
, jackie going through punishment or traning
.
.
. these schticks have all been seen before
, in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from tyhe seventies
and early eighties
.
but they
' re still hillarious as ever
. likewise
, jackie has a
_ great
_ supporting cast
, many of whom were alsot in other early jackie films
,
and they
' re oftenly hte source of plenty ofthe hilarity on thier own
. the realy big thing about
" drunken master
"
,
though
, that inspired several copycats
( including a couple starring jackie himself
) anbd a sequal fifteen yeasr later
, was the drunken
- style kung fu
. i
' m not certain whether or not this is actually a genuin style of kung fu
,
but the priciple behind it is tothe imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard tothe lull the enemy into a false sence of security
.
.
. adn it apparently helps if you
' re drunk hwile you
' re doing it
. genuine or not
, i have to admit
, there
' s just something incredibly funn about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents annd makeing mincemeat out of them before they even realize what
' s going on
. cmo tothe think ofthe it
, perhaps this element is what accounts for this film
' s success over any of the other jackie films
.
.
. it
' s not just martial arts
, it
' s the kind of martial arts that mkaes yuo stop
and go
,
" whoa
.
.
.
" on the negitive side
, the cinematography in this film is nothing special
, the film stock isnt rather primitive
, the plot is oftenly rather slow
,
and thge subtitles are somtimes extemely hard to read against tje background
.
" gone with the wind
"
, htis isn
' t
. still
, if you like martial arts films
, or liuke what you
' ve seen so far of jackie chan
and want to see more
, give it a shot
. it
' s much more
" real
" than chuck norris or jean
- claude van damme
. you might very well like it
. another interesting thing about
" drunken master
" has to do with its video availability in the us
.
" drunken master
" is thte only eary jackie chan movie that i know of thta you can find infront its orginial
, letterboxed
, hong kong subtitled form
, commercially available on vhs
( from magnum video
, in a gold box
, for about
$ 10
)
. there are plenty of otehr early jackie films around
,
but these are typicaly eather inthe dubbed
, pan
-
and
- scanned form or else import tapes priced fo rental instead ofthe purchase
. thankfully
,
" drunken master
"
, at least
, is available in the aspect ratio in whitch it ws meant tothe be seen
, at a very affordable price
. if you like
" drunken master
"
, take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are outloud there
( even the dubbed ones aren
' t really
_ too
_ bad
.
.
. if nothing else
, yuo cxan enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun ofthe tghe dialogue
)
. i patricularly recommend
" spritual kung fu
"
,
" half a loaf of kung fu
"
, the
" fearless hyena
" movies
, adn
" snake
& crane arts of shaolin
"
. also
, the mostly
- unrelated
- storywise sequel
,
" drunken master ii
"
, will hit theaters in american realease sometime later htis year
(
though what its american
- release title will be is still uncertain
)
and comes
_ highly
_ recommended by htis reviewer
. allso
, fo a rather different interpretation of tje character wong fei
- hong
( who is in fact a popular figure fomr chineese folklore
)
, i
' ve been told to suggest the
" once apon a tyme in china
" series starring jet li
(
though i haven
' t personally seen any of them
yet
)
. if you choose to watch
" drunken master
"
, i realyl hope you enjoy it
,
and i hope it starts tothe open your eyes to the wonderful world of aisian cinema that
' s out there
. all in all
, i give tihs film an
.
