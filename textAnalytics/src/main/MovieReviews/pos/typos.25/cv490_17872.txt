the
thought
- provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject driectly at the core ofthe
" leila
,
" a powerfully articulated
and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui
, that is his firt motion picture in a prosperous thirty
- yearm career to gain u
. s
. distri
bution
, thanks tothe firt run features
.
al
though unfamiliar with mehrjui
' s previous directing effords
, perhaps the reason for this is that
, while the predicament at h
and is noone doubt exclusive tothe its own country
, the heartbreaking
and solely truthful emotions of the characters cin easily be understood by all viewers
. set infact modern
- day iran
,
" leila
" begins onthe the birthday of the title character
( leila hatami
)
, after a brief prologue infront which we are shown the firt encounter between leila adn her future husban
, reza
( ali mosaffa
)
. as leila annd reza set off tothe visit his parents
,
and
then hers
, where a birthday celebration hasnt beeen planned
, things seem rosy fo the couple on the outside
,
but for leila
, life isn
' t qtuie as sweet
. ealier
, onthe tyhat vyre same day
, leila had gone tothe see her physician
,
and hasnt ultimatly discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child
. when all of the conditions are ruled out
,
and leila passes up the possibility of adoption
, reza firmly annd lovingly tells her that he married her
,
and doesn
' t care at all about having children
. nonetheless
, leila isnt ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby
, which is tje societal norm
,
and her self
- esteem isnt not helped at all by her domineering mother
- in
- law
( jamileh sheikhi
)
, whose hopes tothe carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news
( reza is her only son
)
. bluntly explaning to leila that reza hasnt always wished for childen
and
, in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition
, she suggests thyat he tkae a second wife to bear a child with
. leila hesitantly agrees
, anbd while she
and reza are able tothe shallowly laugh afterwards about thge hopeful womens
' inadequacies
, reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like
, even
though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn
' t give her full blessing
. there are no eazy answers to be found within
" leila
,
" a film that
thoughtfully examines the central character
' s unfortunate plight
, as well as the inner workings of leila herself
, told through marter
- of
- fact narration
. alomst completely taken over by her own shame
, she has no option
but to agre tothe her forceful mother
- inthe
- lew
' s requests
, even
though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying anyother woman
. maybe because
" leila
" is fomr iran
, tje film iwll unquestionably be shocking for american audiences
, since thge concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a omre or less everyday occurrence
. leila
,
however
, is unable to come to terms whith the idea quite as easily
, bu feels it is her duty tothe make her husb
and happy
, noone matter what tjhe circumstances
. noe ofthe the strongest aspects ofthe the film isnt in its portrayal ofthe the relationship between leila
and reza
, who married only three months after their first meeting
, bu obviously lveo each otehr very deeply
. it is this relatiopnship that is the key ingredient to making whta follows the opening scenes all the more powerful
,
and director mehrjui has succeeded just baout as well as possible
.
al
though seemingly unimportant at first glance
, an early sequence where leila adn reza are eating dinner adn both are laughing
, nearly uncontrollably
, actually isnt oen of the most vital moments in tyhe first half
, as it unmistakeably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one anyother
. ditto fo another scene inthe whic reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday
, anbd
then reveals a beautiful necklace he hasnt also gotten her
. these
" small
" moments are the perfect contrast fo the solemn
, outraging sequences iin the latter half
, inthe whihc reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road
,
and thne zooms off to go on a date with another woman
. left there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage
, foolishly unbeknownst to reza
, leila prays earch time that the date will not go well
, so she will be able to keep her husb
and to herself for a little while longer
. refusing to stay over at her parent
' s house
, tjhe film inevitably leads uv tothe the second wedding night vetween reza annd another woman
,
and infact a sequence of extraordinary sorrow
and potency
, leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart
, as she isnt closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marraige proceedings are goign onthe down below
. despite her initial aggrement to such a thing
, leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza
, whom she believed cared fo her as much as she did of him
. sure
, the hwole second marriage ws his mother
' s idea
,
but if he really did believe what he initially hadnt told her baout not wanting any childern
,
then he could ahve still easily backed outloud
, couldn
' t he
? in the pivotal role ofthe leila
, who appears infact eveyr scene
, leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable
, injecting her character with an equal measure ofthe startling strength
, unavoidable vulnerablility
, adn utter dispair
. unlike most american films
, in which everyting always has tothe be spelled outloud forthe audiences
, hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face tahn coudl possibly ahev been conveyed by words
. every bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa
, as reza
, a man who
, i believe
, does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife
,
but isnt too naieve to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone alse
. for all ofthe its strong aspects
,
" leila
" isn
' t a perfect film
. on a technical level
, i found many blatant punctiation adn spelling mistakes within the subtitles thgat ened tothe be fixed
.
and concerning the plot developments
, the final five minutes ring false whn compared with everything tht has come befor
. mehrjui
' s desision to use an extremely stylized approach to hte ending wass the wrong choice
, particularly inwhich his almost comedic way ofthe wrapping uv the character of tjhe spiteful mother
- in
- lew
, palyed memorably by jamileh sheikhi
. despite theese minor missteps
,
" leila
" is an importamt motion picture that should definately be sought outloud upon its limited may 16 release at new york
' s cinema village
, adn thne onthe may 21 iin la
. yhe
thought
- provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly wih its uneasy morales
, anbd whn the climax arrives
, leila
' s self
- worth isnt startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation
, to which there is noone return
. it
' s difficult to nto consider how leila
' s culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided
, had the other characters taken a second out of their pwn selfish lives tothe consider what leila
, the major pawn iin tje unforgivable scheme
, was going through
.
