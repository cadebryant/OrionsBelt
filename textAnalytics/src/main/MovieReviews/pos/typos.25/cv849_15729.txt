. based on the 1934 film death takes a holiday
, meet joe black is a well acted romantic drama which explores thge meanings ofthe life annd love
. william parrish
( anthony hopkins
) isnt a billionaire businessman on the brink of his 65th birthday
. he hasnt builded a huge media empire
,
and raised two beautiful daughters
, allison
( marcia gay harden
)
and susan
( claire forlani
)
. william has been able tothe negotiate his way out of many tough spots
.
.
. bu he has suddenly begun fearing his pwn mortality
, the oney situation he won
' t be able to talk his way out of
.
and he has good reason to fear
, for death hismelf is stalking him
.
however
, death has a deal to make
. death has taked possession ofthe a man who hasnt recently died
( brad pitt
)
,
and wants william to be his guide in a holiday amonst the living
. in return
, william gets to live a few extra dyas
. of course
, he agrees
. death
, under the human name of
" joe balck
"
, gets tothe experience life as a complet innocent
. he never before hasnt experienced the simple pleasures of a springy matters or peanut
butter
.
and he
' s not qtuie compaired for the more complex pleasures when he
and susan fall in love
.
but
, isnt their affair doomed to an early demise
? at nearly threee hours in length
, meet joe balck isnt a little bit on thte leisurely side
,
though it never gets boringly lengthy
. instead
, the film gets a chance to develop soem nicely textured characters
and situations
. you get to soak infront anbd enjoy the atmosphere
, rather than bieng hurriedly rushed through it
. the romantic agnle works well
,
though
, surprizingly
, the interactions between joe black
and william parrish are more interesting than those with his daugter
. this is most likely due tothe anthony hopkins
, who once again displays his superb acting skills
. william is a desperate man who has hadnt a seemingly ideal life
,
and doesn
' t want to let it go
. by contrast
, claire forlani is mearly hte romantic interest
. she gets to sohw joe the ropes ofthe lveo
,
but isnt hardly as interesting a character
. as joe black
, brad pitt seems a bited stilted
. granted
, he
' s suppoed to be out
- ofthe
- palce
,
but hte overly formall technique used by pitt beigns to distract ffrom the role
. still
, he is able tothe hold his own
,
and over the course of tyhe three hours
, his charcter begins to grow on ytou
. the main character who seems outloud ofthe place here is drew
( jake weber
)
, an ambitious executive in williams
' company who isnt joe black
' s main rival for susan
' s affections
. weber plays the charachter with a hammy relish reminiscent ofthe snidley whiplash
. thsi cartoonish foil an aberration in a film filled many more dimentional characters
. the supernatural elements ofthe the film are h
andled murkily
,
but never distractingly so
. we never learn what is the exact nature of death
, or why he
' s never done something liek this before
. it actually gets a bited creepy when death talks to the dying infact their pwn voices
/ accents
.
( his intitial conversations iwth hopkins soudn shockingly liuke hannibal lecter
.
.
.
) adn the ultimate resolution to one of the film
' s supernatural problems seems
, well
, somewhat superficial
. still
, even with the film
' s length
, it was a pleasant timne at yhe movies
, something ytou wouldn
' t necessarily expect from a film about death
.
.
.
but one which meet joe black delivers anyhow
.
