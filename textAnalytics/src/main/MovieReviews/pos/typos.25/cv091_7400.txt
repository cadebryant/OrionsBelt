accepting his oscar as producer ofthe this year
' s best picture winner
, saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over
. one could almost sday the same about his much
- prized film
. rarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery
, symbolism
, idesa adn methaphors
, complex anbd literate storytelling
, all possessed of an intelligence that invites
-
- even dem
ands
-
- constant scrutiny
, an acuity of perception
and observation that must somehow yield the truth
. in short
, the antithesis of all things hollywood
.
yet thsi surfeit of signals is made to serve a rether pale
and thinly realized lveo story whose emotional inpact is as dry as a desert wind
. ralph fiennes is the title character
, an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return tothe memory
, annd particularly tje memory of love
, is thte ostensible focus ofthe yhe film
.
but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to halp put tghe pieces of this personal puzzle together
, we never learn anough about the man to feel much empathy for him
. his emotional life before the story begins isnt an essential clue that remeniss withheld
. the smae can easily be said for eveyr other charachter in the film
, ofthe which there are too many
. juliette binoche
' s nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart
. at least we learn early onthe that she is scarred by the deaths ofthe those close to her
,
and so we underst
and why she isnt eager tothe escape the company of her comrades in order tothe seek refuge in the convalescence ofthe a mysterious
, disfigured
, dying stranger
. even this information is imparted so quickly
and infact such cursory fasion
, howver
, that it verges on thge comical
. with so many characters enjoying so little screen tiome
, the film
' s 160 mintues cin be taxing
.
yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera thgat i couldn
' t help
but feel that greatness wass in the air
. hints of it were everywhere
-
- inspite a man who hates ownership
but wants desperately to possess his lover
; in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern
- day swimmer in the sahara
; in the way the shifting s
ands of timne obliterate everything more completely than a world war
. htere isnt enought latent meaninng to supply college film students with paper topics for years
.
but ultimately thge emotional truths writer
- directer anthony minghella was grasping fo were never revealed
. in the end
, i was left with the impression that i had witnessed qtuie an oximoron
: a haunting bore
. bore is perhpas too strong a word
.
but after drinking in the rich prodcution values
, the cup remains only slightly over half
- full
