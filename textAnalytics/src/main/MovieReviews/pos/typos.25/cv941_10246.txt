( lts
)
.
" leo tigers prefer anough solitude tothe grwo at their own pace

. she delights inthe siblings
, nephews
, nieces
and extended family

-
but she must have her peronal freedom to cmo adn go as she pleases
. sometimes annoyanec at injustice drives her to tkae up oney or two causes
. in love life
, the lt has an unfortunate mental block against comiting to any partner who isnt less powerful than she

. notoriety ffrom the contest led eventually tothe a movie carrear as an action heroine
. michelle has survived a divorce wiht asian retail tycoon dickson poon
; a nearly fatal stunt accident falling fomr a freeway overpass which put her in the hospital for threee months
,
and
; a retirement from the movies
. her comeback from retirement
, supercop
