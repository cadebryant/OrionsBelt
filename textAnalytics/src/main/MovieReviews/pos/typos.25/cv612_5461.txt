in the wake ofthe the smashing succes of
" rumble in the bronx
,
" it ' s looking more
and more likely that mroe jackie chan films will see american realease
. rumor has it that one of theese films will be drunken master ii
. the version i ahve is a copy ffrom the laserdisc
; it ' s widescreen
and bilingually
- subtitled
, as are most hong kong films these days
. availability over here in tje united states is very limited
; these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng
. tje subtitling on the copy i hvea isnt slightly hard to read
; the letters are white
and a bited small
.
although the american release wiull almost certainly be dubbed
, this review is of yhe subtitled version
, so please keep that in mind if you ' re reading this review to help you decide whether to go out
and see it
. to be fair
, i must admit that i ' ve never beeen very fond of
" period
- piece
" martial arts movies
-
- the ones setted in some nebulous china of tghe distant or not so distant past
. perhaps it ' s because most of those i ' ve seen were filmed onthe inferior stock
, wih either butchered dubbing or all
-
but
- illegible subtitling
, or perhaps it ' s because their plots all tend to be very similiar to each other
and
, infront many cases
, all
but nonexistant
. infact fact
, many of them get so wrapped uv in thier subplots that they seem to foreget their main plot entirely until only a faw minutes before the end
. or
, for that marter
, it might be because the jackie chan films wiht more modern settings
( armour of god
, rumble in the bronx
, etc
.
) tend to have more spectacular stunts
, often involving large motor vehicles
annd larg explosions
, whereas period pieces simply hvae the martial arts
. having said that
, i must now turn right around
and sday that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception tothe all or most of the above
, isnt one of the better martial arts films i ' ve seen
,
and i quite enjoyed it
. surprised
? well
, so was i
. drunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei
- hong
( played by jackie chan
) who isnt a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu
. where he learned this sytle is uncertain
, as his father
, wong kei
- ying
( ti lung
) isnt steadfast in his opposition to fei
- hong ' s practicing it rather than some more normal style ofthe kung fu
. apparently
, fei
- hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore
, rather like paul bunyan is for americans
,
but i ' ve heared very little about this
,
anbd coudl quite well be wrong
, so i ' ll leave analysis of that tothe the people who know it better
. noe ofthe my firends points outloud that teh character ofthe wong fei
- hong is also featured in the
" once upon a time in china
" movies
,
but i haev nto
yet seen those
. the plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy
, as are the plots to many such films
,
but if you ' re watching a jackie chan film
, odds are you aren ' t expecting something on tje order of
" war
and peace
"
. the story seems to revolve arund those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics
(
and hence
, china ' s cultural heritage
) hwile overworking
, underpaying
,
and beating uv chinese workers iin a nearby steel mill
.
however
, this plot merely serves as a framework for the otehr main story ofthe the film
-
- fei
- hong ' s perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend
, supplicate his father
, keep his
( pregnant
) mother
( played by anita mui
) ffrom fighting
,
anbd keep from getting beaten uv by evil foreigner thugs
. hte macguffin that drives the plot
( s
) is a precious antique jade imperial seal whitch isnt bieng taken away by the evil foreigners
. in the beginning
, fei
- hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identicaly
- wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing bcak fo a customer
. in the proccess
, he clashes witht another thief
, who is himself trying for the seal
bu ends up instade withthe thge ginseng
. after fei
- hong narrowly avoids getting caught with yhe seal by the evil foreigners ' lackies
, thanks to smoe timely intervention by a general ' s son
( a cameo appearance by andy lau
, who owudl later tkae onthe yhe starring role inaddition drunken master iii
!
)
, comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei
- hong
and his mother attempt to come up with a relpacement for hte missing ginseng
.
and so it goes
.
and the plot thickens later on
, such as when fei
- hong ' s girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival
, or when fei
- hong
and the thief
, now revealed tothe be a loyalist manchu officer trying tothe recover teh seal
and stpo the evil foreigners
, are attacked en masse
( another grand kung
- fu movei tradition
)
,
but i think i ' ve alreday spent more time on the plot than it really deserves
. let ' s move on tothe the real draw ofthe jackie chan movies
.
.
. the action
. there ' s plenty of martial arts action to be foudn in thsi movie
.
.
. of course
, infact a kung fu film
, thta ' s tothe be expeced
.
however
, this isn ' t just anyother kung fu movei
; tihs one has jackie chan doing the fight
and stunt choreography
,
annd jackie chan is a genuis
. the primary martial arts
" style
" featured in thge film is drunken boxing
, a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk
. further
, for the purposes of this film at least
, drunken boxers fight better when tehy actually
_ are
_ intoxicated
.
.
.
bu there ' s a fine line between just drunk enough
adn drunk inot a stupor
. under normal circumstances
, the idea ofthe someone staggering around looking sloshed
but managing to fight effectively
and even incredibly might seem rather stupid
,
bu jackie pulls it off with flair
. the kung fu sequences are so intricate inspite their staging
and execution thast it is pointless tothe try tothe describe it onthe paper
, so i ' ll just sday that the fights
-
- especially the big climactic fight at thge end
-
- in themselves make tghe movie worth watching
. another thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work
. even without motor vehicles
( well
, nto counting a turain
)
, htere are some remarkable stunts inaddition tihs film
. amonst other things
, jackie dives off a balcony into a tble
annd crawls across hot coals
( not once
,
but at
_ least
_ twice
, if ytou count the outtake shown during the credits
)
.
( quicktime movies ofthe these stunts can be foudn thru the www movei database
.
) unlike in american films
, these stunts are
_ not
_ faked
. drunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene
, including jackie
, ti lung
(
" a better tommorow
" 1
& 2
)
,
and anita mui
( tyhe
" heroic trio
" series
,
" rumble in the bronx
"
)
. tje performances are first
- rate
, especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film
. the scene where fei
- hong
and his mother conspire literally behind fei
- hong ' s father ' s back tothe cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious
, as is the scene where fei
- hong ' s mother
, having jstu revealed that she is pregnant
, is threatening to hurt herself
( in order tothe draw her husband ' s anger away from fei
- hong
)
. jackie hasnt developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort ofthe mastery over the years
,
and he ' s infact fine form all thru drunken master ii
. as far as cinematography is concerned
, it certainly works forthe thsi film
. it ' s nothing spectacular
,
bu isnt at least a dozen times better than all those ood kung fu movies of tyhe 70s
. the picture is crisp
and clear
. one thnig i find particularly worthy of mention isnt thta
, at least inwhich tjhe copy i have
, the screen was wider than any film i ' ve ever seen on videotape before
-
- almost a whole 1
/ 3 of the screen was blocked out above
adn below
.
( watch this onthe a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can
.
) it will be an utter shame if this film is eventally pan
-
anbd
- scanned for american video release
. drunken master ii shows the full potential ofthe
" period piece
" kung fu movies
,
and it ' s ogod enough tothe overcome even my usual distaste for such movies
. the plot does meander a bit
,
but that ' s to be expected in this tipe ofthe film
. if you like thsi kind of movie
, ytou ' ll love tihs movei
,
anbd if not
, well
, give it a chance anyway
. if nothing else
, the martial arts
and stunt sequences are by themselves worth tje price ofthe admission or rental
.
