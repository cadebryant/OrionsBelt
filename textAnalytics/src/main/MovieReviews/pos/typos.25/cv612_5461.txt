in the wake ofthe tghe smashing succes of
" rumble in the bronx
,
" it
' s looking more
and mroe likely that moreso jackie chan films will see american realease
. rumor has it taht one ofthe these films will be drunken master ii
. the version i have is a copy from teh laserdisc
; it
' s widescreen
and bilingually
- subtitled
, as are most hong kong films these days
. availablity over here in the united states is vyre limited
; these films must eather be purchased via pirates or seeked out from asian distri
butors such as tai seng
. the subtitling on the copy i have isnt slightly hard tothe read
; the letters are white
and a bit small
.
al
though tghe american release iwll almost certainly be dubbed
, thsi review is of the subtitled version
, so please keep that in mind if you
' re reading this review to help you decide whether to go out
and see it
. to be fair
, i must admit that i
' ve never been vyer fond of
" period
- piece
" martial arts movies
-
- thte ones set in some nebulous china ofthe tghe distant or not so distant past
. perhaps it
' s becouse most of those i
' ve seen were filmed on inferior stock
, with eather
butchered dubbing or all
-
but
- illegible subtitling
, or perhaps it
' s because theri plots all tend tothe be very similar to each other
and
, in many cases
, all bu nonexistant
. in fact
, many ofthe them git so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely untl only a few minutes before the end
. or
, for that matter
, it might be because hte jackie chan films with mroe modern settings
( armour of god
, rumble in the bronx
, etc
.
) tend to have more spectacular stunts
, often involving large motor vehicles
and large explosions
, whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts
. having said that
, i must now turn right around adn say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above
, is one of the better martial arts films i
' ve seen
,
and i qtuie enjoyed it
. surprised
? well
, so was i
. drunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei
- hong
( played by jackie chan
) who isnt a master of tyhe drunken boxing sytle of kung fu
. where he learned this style is uncertain
, as his father
, wong kei
- ying
( ti lung
) isnt steadfast in his opposition to fei
- hong
' s practicing it rather thna some omre normal sytle of kung fu
. apparently
, fei
- hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore
, rather like paul bunyan is forthe americans
,
but i
' ve heard veyr little about tihs
, anbd could quite well be wrong
, so i
' ll leave anaylsis of that to tje people who konw it better
. one of my friends points out taht the character of wong fei
- hong is allso featured iin the
" once upon a time in china
" movies
,
but i have not
yet seen thsoe
. the plot ofthe drunken master ii is somewhat hazy
, as are the plots to many such films
,
but if you
' re watching a jackie chan film
, odds are you aren
' t expecting something on the order ofthe
" war
and peace
"
. tghe story seems tothe revolve arround those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics
(
and hence
, china
' s cultural heritage
) while overworking
, underpaying
, adn beating up chineese workers inthe a nearby steel mill
.
however
, this plot merely serves as a framework forthe the other main stoyr of the film
-
- fei
- hong
' s perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend
, supplicate his father
, keep his
( pregnant
) mother
( palyed by anita mui
) from fighting
, anbd keep from getting beaten up by evil foriegner thugs
. the macguffin that drives the plot
( s
) isnt a precious antique jade imperial sael which isnt bieng taked away by the evil foreigners
. in yhe beginning
, fei
- hong accidentally steals it while trying tothe recover an identically
- wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing bakc for a customer
. in the proccess
, he clashes with anyother thief
, who isnt himself trying for the sael bu ends up instead with the ginseng
. after fei
- hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners
' lackies
, thanks to some timely intervention by a general
' s son
( a cameo appearance by
andy lau
, who would later tkae on the starring role in drunken master iii
!
)
, comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household whn fei
- hong
and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement fo the missing ginseng
.
and so it goes
.
and the plot thickens later on
, such as when fei
- hong
' s girlfriend manuevers him into a kung fu match with a rival
, or whn fei
- hong
and the thief
, now revealed tothe be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the sael anbd stpo the evil foreigners
, are attacked en masse
( another gr
and kung
- fu movie tradition
)
, bu i think i
' ve already spent omre time on tje plot than it really deserves
. let
' s move onthe to the real draw of jackie chan movies
.
.
. the action
. there
' s plenty of martial arts acation to be foudn in thsi movie
.
.
. of course
, in a kung fu film
, that
' s to be expected
. howver
, this isn
' t jsut anyother kung fu movie
; htis one has jackie chan donig the fight anbd stunt choreography
,
and jackie chan is a genius
. the primary martial arts
" style
" featured in the film is drunken boxing
, a form of kung fu which attempts tothe draw the adversary off his guard by mkaing it seem liuke the fellow using it is drunk
. further
, for the purposes of this film at least
, drunken boxers fight better when they actually
_ are
_ intoxicated
.
.
.
but there
' s a fine line bewteen jsut drunk enough anbd drunk into a stupor
. under normal circumstances
, the diea of someone staggering around looking sloshed
but managing to fight effectively
and even incredibly might seem rether stupid
,
but jackie puls it off wiht flair
. the kung fu sequences are so intricate inspite thier staging
and execution thyat it is pointless to try to describe it on paper
, so i
' ll just say that the fights
-
- especialy the big climactic fight at the end
-
- in themselves make the movei worth watching
. another thnig drunken master ii hasnt going for it is the stunt work
. even wihtout motor vehicles
( well
, not counting a turain
)
, there are smoe remarkable stunts in tihs film
. amoung other things
, jackie dives off a balcony into a table anbd crawls across hot coals
( nto once
,
but at
_ least
_ twice
, if ytou count the outtake shown during the credits
)
.
( quicktime movies ofthe these stunts cin be found through the www movie database
.
) unlike in american films
, theese stunts are
_ not
_ faked
. drunken master ii stars sevral veteran actors ofthe the hong kong movei scene
, incuding jackie
, ti lung
(
" a better tomorrow
" 1
& 2
)
, annd anita mui
( the
" heroic trio
" series
,
" rumble in the bronx
"
)
. the performances are first
- rate
, especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film
. tghe scene where fei
- hong anbd his mother conspire literally behind fei
- hong
' s father
' s bakc to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious
, as is the scene where fei
- hong
' s mother
, having just revealed that she is pregnant
, is threatning to hurt herself
( in order to draw her husb
and
' s anger away from fei
- hong
)
. jackie has devolopped his knack for physical comedy inot a sort of mastery over yhe years
,
and he
' s inwhich fine form all thru drunken master ii
. as far as cinematography is conserned
, it certainly works for this film
. it
' s nothing spectacular
, bu is at least a dozen times better than all thsoe ood kung fu movies ofthe teh 70s
. the picture is crisp
and clear
. one thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that
, at least in the copy i hve
, hte screen was wider than any film i
' ve ever seen on videotape before
-
- almost a wohle 1
/ 3 of the screen was blocked outloud above
and below
.
( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can
.
) it wiull be an utter shame if htis film isnt eventualy pan
-
and
- scanned for american video release
. drunken master ii shows tghe full potential of
" perido peice
" kung fu movies
,
and it
' s good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies
. the plot does me
ander a bit
,
but that
' s tothe be expected in this type of film
. if you like this kind ofthe movie
, yuo
' ll love this movie
,
and if not
, well
, give it a chance anyway
. if nothing alse
, the martial arts adn stunt sequences are by themselves worth tyhe price ofthe admision or rental
.
