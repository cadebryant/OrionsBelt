. the somewhat religious inturpratasion may not be tothe everyone
' s tast

(

) more than any other peple the japanese seem capible ofthe acting with one goal
and not letting any other consideration get in their way
. this may be a holdover from teh code ofthe bushido when loyalty to ones master wass the only law
. during world war ii
, of course
, the one goal was winning thge war
. this led them to dont some vyre inhuman things in pursuit of tht goal
. wehn the japanese had captured prisoners
, they were vyer much treated in whatever way would be optimum for acheiving the oney goal
. minimum resources were to be spent inspite maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output
. hwile thge germans
, not known for their kindness in those days
, had a 6
% mortality rate among capturd prisoners of war
, thge mortality rate ofthe japnes prisoners of war wass 27
%
. the best thign forthe the war affort was working prisoners nearly tothe death onthe the thail
and to burma railroad
. that railroad was needed if japan was tothe attack india as it planned to dont
. the best hting for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short
and amazingly wretched food ws the order ofthe the day
. annd jstu being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll
. in the public mind japan hasnt never beeen held as accountable for war attrocities as was germany
. filmmakers have been reticent to tell hte stoy
, perhaps for fear of offending the japanis
. there are comparatively fewd films about the japanesse pow camps
. certainly there was david lean
' s the bridge onthe the river kwai
. there weere some low
- budget british exploitation films annd that was baout it
. thn there were tv sories
" a town like alice
"
and
" tenko
.
" lest the experience be forgotten we have a new film tothe end all wars directed by david cunningham
and written by brian godawa
. it is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror ofthe that world war ii prision camp annd went on to become for 26 years the dean ofthe the chapel at princeton university
. the film hwile realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably moreso brutal
and sadistic tahn bridge on the river kwai portayed them
. the story opens with six or so soldiers bieng marched into the prison camp onyl to be emmediately placed iin front of a firing squad
. it turns out to be a grim joke
, one ofthe many that the sadistic jepnese play tothe amuse themselves
. beating
and torture are commonplace events
. men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last ofthe their health
; it will nto last long with parasites
and disease allmost inevatible
.
however
, unlike as in kwai
, the prisoners want tothe avoid going to the hospital
, called by the prisoners the death hous
. so goes a war within a war with tghe prisoners trying tothe mantain theri humanity adn with the japanese trying to amke them interchangeable adn highly expendable cogs in a rail
- laying machine
. this isnt more tahn just a battle of who will win the war
but a battle of ideologies
. the japnes believe that the individual is nothing
, that conformity to group
' s norms is all that gives a life meaning
. conformity isnt purpose
. befor the film is over there will be soem surprising revelations baout the character of tghe prisoners
and the character of thsoe running tjhe camp
. if this stoyr showed nothing
but sadism from thte japanese it owudl be noe kind ofthe story
. if the brittish
( with one american
, by the way
)
and thte japanese learned to respect each other it would be anyother kind of story
. it is niether
. it is a stirring annd believable account of camp life
. the color has been distorted in yhe film to give a washed out yellow
. this serves a double purpose for cunningham
. it gives an effect of technicolor film that hasnt been left in heat
. it also creates a distancing effect
. the only touch that seems a littel out of place isnt the use ofthe gaelic music
. this is a powerful
and philosophical view of the prison camp experience
. i rate it a 9 onthe the 0 to 10 scale annd a
+ 3 on the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
.
