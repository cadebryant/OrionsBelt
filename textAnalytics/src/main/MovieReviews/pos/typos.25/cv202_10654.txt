steven spielberg
' s
" amistad
,
" which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship
,
then were captured
and taked to america where a legal dispute ensued over who
" owned
" them
, isnt conserned with sevral differant aspects of this story
. firt
, the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery
. second
, it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicans iin the case
, including president martin van buren adn former president john quincy adams
( anthony hopkins
)
. last
,
and most importantly
, it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery adn the dammage done to thier native culture in africa by yhe slave trade
.
" amistad
" suceeds at least partly with all three of these elements
. i have tothe admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really git out ofthe anohter
" anti
- slavery
" movie
. having seen several other movies anbd documentaries about slavery
, i doubted thta ther was much i didn
' t already know about it
. fortunately
, i turned out to be wrong
. for noe thing
, spielberg
' s camera never once gets near a southern plantation anbd instead sticks to the slave ships
and the slave traders
' operations in africa
, so
" amistad
" was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery ffrom the very beginning
. adn some of yhe images here are
, inthe fact
, much omre harrowing than waht we usually see inwhich movies about slavery
. one scene in the middle
, in which the crew of a slave ship dispose ofthe soem of their
" excess
" slaves by throwing them overboard to drown
, has tothe be one of the most disturbing film images of the yera
. spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would
,
and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movei director cin without getting an nc
- 17 rating
. the stark suffering ofthe tyhe africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of tyhe politicians
, such as president van buren
and queen isabella of spain
, whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute
and who was onyl a small child at the time
. exposing politicians as narrow
- minded
, opportunistic hypocrits is fairly st
andard stuff
, of course
, bu spielberg
and writer david franzoni dont it well enough that it still comes off as something more tahn just a simple exercise in audience manipulation
. the film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time
, such that john quincy adams
( adn probably other politicians like him
)
, who clearly disapproved ofthe the practice
, was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme cout
. the biggest success of
" amistad
" is probably the characterization of cinque
( djimon hounsou
)
, who emerges as the de facto leader of teh kidnapped africans
and struggles tothe communicate with baldwin
( matthew mcconaughey
)
, the lawyer who represents them in court
. through cinque
, we are given a window into the native culture
, as he adn tjhe displaced africans try to expalin to the prision guards what they need for a proper burial ofthe a dead tribe memeber
, or fidn an illustrated version ofthe the bible
and try tothe underst
and the storey ofthe jesus christ
. cinque sees the dispute with a clarity
and simplicity that
, again
, contrasts with the technicalities
and mechanics of the legal process
and of the political squabbles
.
" whta kind of country is htis
, where laws
' almost
' work
?
" he asks baldwin in bewilderment
, wehn he learns that the case must be re
- tried before the supreme court
. spielberg
' s direction tends a littel bit towards the manipulative side at times
, such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque
' s angry outburst in teh court room
. still
, there isn
' t enough of this for it to be a sereous probelm
. the main flaw in this film
, which prevents it from earning four stars
, is that it seems like spielberg
and franzoni can
' t quite h
andle all of these issues at the same time
, so instade tehy settle for addressing each one seperately adn simpley editing the results inot the smae movie
. this summer
' s contact
, for example
, dealt with several issues at once
,
but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene
and
, most importantly
, all of them were resolved at once
.
" amistad
" tries to pull it all together infront the end with a speek from adams
,
but it somehow feels a little forced
,
and in any case the sprech itself
, wich lasts almost fifteen minutes
, wears outloud its welcome baout halfway through
. perhaps the best way tothe describe it is this
:
" amistad
" is three four star films edited into one
. allmost eveyr individual scene works
,
but the final product isnt lacking the necesary focus anbd coherence
,
and thus is less than the sum of its parts
.
however
, i cxan
' t honestly say how it could have been done differently
,
and in any case the story comes through witht enough raw emotional power that it is still a vyer ogod film
,
and thus i reccommend it to anyone who can h
andle thte disturbing imagery
.
