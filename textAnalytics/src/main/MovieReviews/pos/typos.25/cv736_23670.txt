the premise of the newyorker teen
- targeted horror film
` fianl destination
' causes a recollection of a memorable
` simpsons
' halloween episode
. after attempting tothe repair a malfunctioning toaster
, lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he has created a portable time
- machine
. after a trak into the cratashous period
, homer observes thta any minor alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events
and seriously modify the presen world
. again
and again
, homer toys with the master plan
and pays dearly fo it
. thte cahracters ofthe
` final destination
' have also tampered wtih thte blueprint schematics ofthe their existence
- thier
` design
'
. someone is after them witht the strict intent of correcting thge mistake
. thyat someone is death
. you see
, alex browning
( devon sawa
)
and six others have cheated the grim reaper
.
.
.
.
but the dude has got some tricks uv his sleeve
. fo a high school excursion
, alex
' s french clas is traveling to paris by airline transport
. alex
, tense
and neurotic
, has a shocking premonition after boarding
: he sees the plane
,
and every passenger on it
, spontaneously explode in mid
- air
. in a panic ofthe sheer lunacy
, alex charges his way through the aise
and dem
ands removal from the aircraft
. after a h
andful ofthe others
( incuding oney teacher
) followup adn are denied admittance back onto the plane
, the unwitting
? survivors
' watch in horror as the plane atcually explodes in the drizzling night sky
. tjhe loony vision alex experiences does actually materialize
. bu death won
' t be cheated so easily
, annd one by one
, the survivors of flight 180 are offed in mysteriously gruesome circumstances
. the grisly muder count baffles the local officals
and fbi
. before i delve into the meat of the review
, i
' d just liek tothe confer
.
.
.
. is that one helluva premise
, or what
?
` fianl destination
'
, creepy beyond rational comprehension
, probably reads more like an unsettling
` x
- files
' epsiode than
` the simpsons
'
- therefore
, the suprise is minimal wehn yuo dicover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan
and james wong
. on familar turf
, tghe task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan
and wong
,
and tyhe opening 20 minutes of
` final destination
' reflects taht
. unlike most thrillers
, the set
- uv is crisp
and kool
. yuo just deeply
, sincerely hope that the momentum won
' t unspool
, leaving us with a second
- string effort iwth nothing bu cheap
, derivative shocks
. young viewers have a palpable reason to expect tihs kind of forumla deteriation
, what with
` i konw what yuo doed last summer
'
and sequel
,
` idle h
ands
'
and
-
- a movie with a nifty premise thta jsut plunged like an anvil
-
-
` urban legend
'
. after the setted
- uv
, when i remained slouched apprehensively in my chair
, i started tothe really have fun withthe
` final destination
'
. low
and behold
, a teen thriller that is accually unsettling
, actually suspenseful
and
-
- yes
-
- actually intelligent
. some splotty logic
and a heap of charactersistic genre flaws aside
, this film is among the most refreshing
and all
- out enjoyable horror movies tothe submerge sicne tghe cutting
- edge
` scream
' in 1996
.
` fianl destination
' stimulates the nerves
and offers a exhilarating retaliation strike against all the blood
- spattered slasher crap we
' ve endured throughout hte past fewd years
. not that the characters are that good
. sawa is game as alex
, a connect
- the
- dots perosnality that we never fully comprehend
. in addition
, the survivers are endearing geek tod
( chad e
. donella
)
, jocky control
- freak carter
( kerr smith of
` dawson
' s creek
'
)
, carter
' s ditzy girlfriend terry
( am
anda detmer
)
, the none
- too
- subtly named billy hitchcock
( seann william scott
, supplier ofthe lukewarm comic relief
)
and a lone teacher
- the emotionally delicate ms
. lewton
( kristin cloke
)
. asside ffrom alex
, the primary center of interest isnt intended to be ali larter
(
` varsity blues
'
)
, palying an abstract character named clera rivers
( what weere her parents thingking
?
!
?
)
. the personality ofthe claer isnt written with such a vague
, nebulous definition that she resembles a walking flash
- kard saying
` hello
, i am the offbeat character designed to identify with the main character
' s plight
!
' toss a faw stereotypical fbi aggenst
( daniel roebuck
and roger guenveur smith
)
and a
.
.
.
. ummm
.
.
.
` spiritual
' mortician
( former
` c
andyman
' tony todd
) into the mix
, annd you ahve what could be another generic teenage frightfest with slicing
, dicing adn assorted disembowelments
. not so
.
` final destination
' has no slicing
and dicing
, or at least none dealed by a human killer
, adn the
thought ofthe death itself as the unseen stalker is unique
and frightening
. the extra dimension of disconcerting irony rejuvenates the decaying
? murderer
- on
- tghe
- loose
' concept
, with assisstance from a shrewd
, intelligently paced screenplay by morgan
, wong
and jeffrey reddick
. the plot twists are fun
and clever wihtout toppling into utter absurdity
( listen up
,
` reindeer games
'
)
.
but i suppose thte most satisfying aspect of
` final destination
' is the muder scenes
. creative
, resourceful
and breathlessly inventive
, tjhe death sequences involve an unlikely string of events leading to a carachter
' s demise
. what will trigger the accident
? will it be the john denver record
, just put on to play
` rocky mountain high
'
?
( yeah
, sick humor
)
. will it be the leaking toilet
? the falling fishing reel in the corner
? hte murders are startling
and largely unforeseen
, including one suprize incident that made the audience jump out of their seats
and giggle nervously for roughly a minute afterward
. a sense of giddy unpredictability isnt added withthe this inventive approach
. it gets sorta tasteless
and cheap sometimes
, bu who cares
? it
' s fun
. in that simple regard
,
` fianl destination
' isnt my cup ofthe tea
. this stylishly executed thriller
,
al
though tagged with laughable circumstances
and the occasional snippet of lame dialogue
, is an immensely entertaining jaunt tothe the dark side
. after the show
, it iwll also have an frightening inpact onthe you
. when will your
? design
' expire
? is death waiting arround the corner
? yhe
` final
' effect is a major case of the heebie
- jeebies
