" footloose
" has only oney goal inwhich mind
: to reel in an audiance wih cheesy sentiment
and feel
- good antics
.
and i hate to admit it
; i fell for it
. the movie is about a teenager
( bacon
) who moves to a small town from yhe big city
,
and discovers that dancing hasnt been banned by the local reverend
( lithgow
)
. he ends up falling for the preacher
' s daughter
( singer
)
and showing tyhe whole town what the magic ofthe dance cxan do
. as mentioned at tghe beginning of tihs review
,
" footloose
" is an extremely hokey
and predicatble teen drama
. there are virtually no surprises
, adn the writing is second
- rate
. so why did i enjoy it so much
? for one thing
, the cast is great
. kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role
. we
' re rooting for him right fomr the strat
,
and
, unlike most films of htis genre
, bacon doesn
' t play him as the
" rebel without a clue
" sort
. yes
, he does rebel
,
but he
' s also polite when he needs to be
.
and he never broods
. the rest of the cast is equally impressive
. john lithgow
, seen here palying a normal guy forthe a change
, is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian
.
but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying tothe do what he feels is best forthe his daughter
. by the end of tje film
, we feel a genuine sense of love anbd underst
anding beween him
and the lori singer character
. another nice touch is the music
. we see thte parents ofthe tje kids complaining that the music they listen tothe is filled with
" sexual innuendos
"
,
but that
' s not true at all
. teh title tarck
, performed by kenny loggins
, isnt upbeat
and fun
. during tjhe final sequence
, i was overcome withthe tghe urge to get off the couch
and start dancing
. ofthe course
, i soon realized thgat would be a little pathetic
. anyway
,
" footloose
" is a charming little surprise
. don
' t let the premise prevent you from watching it
. it sucked me in
,
and it
' ll do the same tothe ytou
.
