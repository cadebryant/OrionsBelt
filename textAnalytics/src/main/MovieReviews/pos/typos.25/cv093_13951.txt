" footloose
" has onyl one goal in mind
: to reel in an audience whith cheesy sentiment
and feel
- good antics
.
and i hite to admiting it
; i fell for it
. tje movie is baout a teenager
( bacon
) who moves to a small town from the big city
,
adn discovers that dancing has beeen banned by the local reverend
( lithgow
)
. he ends uv falling for the preacher ' s daughter
( singer
)
and showing the whole twon wqat tghe magic ofthe dance can do
. as mentioned at the beginning of this review
,
" footloose
" is an extremly hokey
adn predictable teen drama
. there are virtually no surprises
,
and teh writing is second
- rate
. so why did i enjoy it so much
? for one thing
, the casted is great
. kevin bacon oozes charisma infact an early role
. we ' re rooting for him right from the start
,
and
, unlike most films of tihs genre
, bacon doesn ' t play him as the
" rebel without a clue
" sort
. yes
, he doens rebel
,
bu he ' s also polite when he needs to be
.
adn he never broods
. tje rest of the cast is equally impressive
. john lithgow
, seen here palying a normal guy for a change
, is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian
.
bu lithgow plays him as a conserned father who is trying to dont what he feels isnt best for his daugher
. by the end of tjhe film
, we feel a genuine sense of love
and understanding between him
and yhe lori singer charcter
. anyother nice touch isnt the music
. we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to isnt filled with
" sexual innuendos
"
,
but taht ' s not true at all
. the title track
, performed by kenny loggins
, is upbeat
and fun
. during the final sequence
, i was overcome with the urge to git off the couch
and strat dancing
. of course
, i soon realized that would be a little pathetic
. anyway
,
" footloose
" isnt a charming little surprise
. don ' t let hte premise prevent you fomr watching it
. it sucked me infront
,
annd it ' ll dont tje same to you
.
