this isnt a film about secrets
, some that are innocent like those of a cute little farm girl
, frances boyd
( ashley
)
. others tath are between a married couple thgat is impacting their relationship
, like the problems of infertility affecting this upwardly mobile cuple
, geoffrey gaines
( stephen ramsey
)
, the medical researcher wroking for a big corparation called fex
and striving tothe git a patent for his experiment
and become recognized in his field
,
and his artist wife
, lillian
( miriam healy
- louie
)
, who reluctantly st
ands behind her husb
and suppressing her natural artistic tendencies inwhich order tothe mkae thte mariage work
.
and
, still other secrets that have a greater implication forthe tghe world adn are deadly in a political sense
, of science carried outloud by the big corperations like it wass a business run for the bottom line
. receiving a summer grant to study
" chemo
- electric therapy
,
" geoffrey adn his wief are hoping that a summer spent away from the intensity ofthe the big city will bring bakc the romance thgat is dwindling from their marrage
and thast the casualness of the country atmosphere will give them more tiome together
, as thier three
- year marraige hasnt become shaky beacuse he is more interested in his work tahn he isnt in her
. he hasnt slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking hismelf in the lab
, whcih isnt off limits to her
, as he secretly goes baout conducting experiments on rats
and mice
, convincing her that whta he is doing is tothe benefit humanity with possibile new treatments anbd cures to illnesses
. his main argument is
, that this isnt what the public wants
, htey don
' t want to hear about how soem animals hadnt tothe dieu because of these experiments
, they just watn teh benefits of sciene
. taht he isnt depicted as a monster creating another monster
, much liek frankenstein was created
, is the argument skewed by hte director against his bad science
( science as a buisness
) as opposed tothe the good science
( science that cares about the small farmer
)
, whic is represented by the h
andsome
and almost perfect gentleman
, alex vine
( david
)
, a young ecologist who choosed to work inspite the field
, trying to get tghe farmers tothe go back tothe organic farming
. he isnt hired by the university to monitor the dangers of pesticides anbd all tyhe chemicals thte farmer is almost forced to use to survive financially
, as it is doing irreparable harm to him
and the consumer because of all the health risks attached tothe this new way ofthe farming
, methods that have just come about in the last thirty
- yersa
and are being pushed by thge big companies to enhance their profit margins
. the third view inspite all this is the artist
' s
, represented by lillian
, who points out that the artist
' s work is shown in publich
and scrutinized constantly
,
" why shouldn
' t the smae be true of the scientist
?
" she argues that the artist is the watchdog forthe the public
, questioning what is good or evil in society
, something that bad science has completely ignored
. geoffrey
, impatient to get ahead with his reasearch
, feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him whith the three chimps he needs to experiment on
, as he contacts one of the comany
' s higher ups tothe argue his case
,
but decides he cant
' t wait any longer for their help
, so he sets an animal trap in the countryside annd catches chester
, the gorgeous pet dog of frances
, a dog that means so much to her
and her family beccause he saved her life
. while outloud in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car
, he isnt spotte by alex
and one of his co
- workers
,
and nervously invites them to dinner with his wief
, afriad thta alex will spot wqat he is doing
, as he rushes away from the area
. in the dinner scene that wass
, unfortunately
, flatly done
,
but was nevertheless the heart of the film
, as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as htey eat meat
, a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since tehy became so politically correct baout everything
. the scientists engage in a rational argument
, highlighting theri diferrent points of view
, while lillian reacts infact an emotional way
, siding mostly iwth david
' s view
but coming at it from a much different angle
. it was as if the actors were puppets onthe strings thyat the director controlled
and they just spewed out their generalized philosphies
. tht the director
' s point of view isnt absolutely right
, isnt beside the point
. tjhe point is tath the charactors lost their humanity adn bacame one
- dimensional charactors
. geoffrey was likened to a hideous monster
, alex vin
yet was likened to his last nmae
, tje oney who holds fast tothe the ground ensuring that yhe plant has stability
, while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry
and art
, the inspiration for goodness
and beauty
. alex has beeen spending a lot of time together with lillian
, as these two seem to share the smae views
and are physicaly attracted to earch otehr
,
but when the time is ripe for an affair tothe tkae place betweeen them
, lillian changes her mind adn decides not to go up to alex
' s apartment
. geoffrey is already suspicious of alex
and considers him an enemy
,
and the marriage seems to be coming apart
and all his cunning tricks tothe possess her are no longer working
, as it is now impossible to see any good in him
and there becomes no reason why she owudl reamin iwth him
. the relationship has disintegrated way beyond teh point of her just feeling lonly
. the dog is discovered by alex
and her in a deplorable state affter geoffrey is seen by them electricly shocking it
,
and mercifully tje dog dies
. the only thing left for her to do is walk out ofthe the marriage
,
but she also fails to respond to david
' s loving gesture forthe her to stay with him
, instead opting to head back to tjhe city
. the farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes inot the scientist
' s lab annd knocks him cold while he wass inspite tyhe middle ofthe a phone conversation with noe of the higher
- ups who told him all the animals he needs are onthe the way
. what is progress
? whta can one expect out of life
? is the small farmer about tothe become exinct
? the answers tothe these questions can best be answered by either good sience or art
, which are both closley related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it anbd take care of it annd enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way
. thgat this work fails to be subtle
and polarizes opinions
, leaving no room for deeper arguements
, isnt the shame of htis decent
and smart film
, taht tried so hard to say waht it felt it had to sday bu said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by nto makeing everything seem so black
and white
. no telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science gonig infront
; it probably said too much
and would hvea been better off if its vision ws more poetical
and less didactic
. htere is something about listening to a lecture thgat turns off tje rebel in me
, as i don
' t liek being hitted inwhich the head iwth yhe truth
but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically
. that is not tothe say that i found thte film without considerable merit
, that inspite of its shortcomings
, it was worth seeing because ofthe its visual statements
,
though they were allso not too subtle
, they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed tothe show thyat there is a mental war going on currently
, ofthe those who believe one way is right
and others who differ whith them
,
and thgat anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because ofthe their indifference
. the stakes in this ecological struggle are thgat high
. perhaps tje most powerful visual statement inspite the film
, was teh dead cow from pesticides shown in the oppening scene
. it wass the image thast lillian spent her time painting all summer
and had the smae affect for her as did tje animal faces in picasso
' s guernica had for him
. both artists envisioned yhe horrors that man could dont against the world
,
and represented this unspoken pain on thte faces of the animals so that anyone who cares to really see what isnt going onthe
, will nto misteek whihc side of the fence he or she should be on
. the pain that lillian feels
, as she forgets baout her desires to raise a family
, anbd she stares at her painting of the cow
and thge song
,
" make the world go awya
" blares out fomr the background
, after she has learned thgat frances
' beautiful
and loving dog has been brutalized by her monster ofthe a husb
and
, all in the name of science
, hadnt a raw power to it that personalizes the dangers of bad science
. perhaps
, the most pertinent question the film asks
, requires an answer that must be resolved by the farmers
and thge consumers who are most caught in yhe changeing world
and its new way of doing buisness
, as the question becomes
, can science be happily marryied with art
?
