warning
: if you actually wish to see tje film
, stop reading tihs
and see it
. while i don ' t blow any plot details
, the more you know baout a movie
, the more disappointing
annd builded up it becomes
( waiting a month to see titanic did the same thing
)
.
but
, in a nutshell
, it ' s a good film
. star wars episode i
: the phantom menace reviewed by vince yim never having been teh biggest star wars fanatic in the world
( i wass more into star trak
: thge next generation
)
, it isnt difficult tothe relate to hte massmedia fandom surrouding the latest installment
, the phantom menace
.
however
, it can ' t be ignored
. endless toys lining the shelves
, endless news reports
,
and a multi
- billion dollar advertising campaign makes it all hte moreso difficult
. with the level of this hype
, one would recall an overhyped diaster from 1998
, godzilla
, hwihc definitely failed to live up to expectations
. thankfully
, tje phantom menace does much
, much better
. while the
" first
" star wars triology told the stoyr of jedi knight luke skywalker
, teh prequels backpeddle tothe tell the back
- story of obi wan kenobi
and a young jedi named anakin skywalker
( who woudl become the father of luke
and evenhtually become darth vader
)
. without blowing too much of thte storey
, the phantom menace evolves arund a peaceful planet naboo
, whcih isnt bieng held hostage by a greedy trade federation
,
and it ' s uv tothe two jedi knights
( qui
- gon ji
, played by liam neeson
annd obi
- wan kenobi
, played by ewan mcgreggor
) to free it
. the phantom menace has taken a literal beating fomr various film critics
, leaving me tothe lower my expectations somewhat
. common complaints range from lack of characterization
, weak narrative
, poore direction of actors
, the dated style
,
annd too much focus over special effects
. still
, film critics often apply much historical theery in regardes to film critiscism
, much of whcih the average film buff does not care for
. hence
, tihs film isnt a lot ofthe fun
and definitely an improvement over the previous films
( even with the
" improvements
" in the speical editions
)
. there are many memorable sequences throughout tyhe film
, ranging from the fast
and furious
" pod race
" sequence
( which isnt a take on the chariot races infront
" ben hur
"
)
and the many fight scenes involving legions of battle droids
. utilizing technology thast is light yeras beyond anything made befoer
, speshal effects
and computers are used to create everthing from monsters tothe robots to amazing cityscapes with incredible detail
. no matter how many times you watch this film
, you wiull catch something new
. the level of humour isnt a bit higher than the previous films as well
, mostly conveyed thru yhe reluctant hero jar jar binks
, who belongs to a race known as the gungans
. best decribed as an mr
. bean from the planet naboo
, he steals the show
. unfortunately
, bieng that he isnt a computer
- generated character
, tells a bit baout the direction of the actors
(
although natalie portman as the queen is pretty effective
, as isnt jake lloyd as tje young anakin skywalker
)
. with star wars mania at an all time high
, there is the risk that the film will disappoint
( i myself had my doubts
)
, which this film does have a tendency to do at times
. htere are a few logic problems wtih the plot
, severeal things are left unchecked
,
and at times seems to be made only forthe diehard star wars fans
(
although the appearance ofthe yhe tusken raiders makes for more thna a few laughs
)
. that
,
and young anakin skywalker is a really annoying character
, coming off as a smarmy
, arrogant brat
( with such an attitude
, it ' s no wonder why he turns tothe the dark side
)
. still
, it seems that many peple
, expecially critics
, are missing the point
. the film is some ofthe thge most fun 2
adn a half hours that you ' ll blow in your life
, which is something i wouldn ' t mind doing again
. while it may not ahve the psychological impact of an academy award contender
, who really cares
? the film is pure fun from beggining tothe end
.
and isn ' t that what really matters
?
