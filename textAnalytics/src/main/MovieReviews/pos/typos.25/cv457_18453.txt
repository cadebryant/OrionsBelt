warning
: if you actually wish tothe see the film
, stpo reading this anbd see it
. while i don
' t blow any plot details
, the mroe you know about a movei
, the more disapointing annd built up it becomes
( waiting a month to see titanic doed thte smae hting
)
. bu
, inthe a nutshell
, it
' s a good film
. star wars episode i
: the phantom menace reviewed by vince yim never having been the biggest star wars fanatic in yhe world
( i was more into star trak
: tjhe next generation
)
, it is difficult to relate tothe the mass f
andom surrounding yhe latest installment
, the phantom menace
. howver
, it can
' t be ignored
. endless toys lining the shelves
, endless news reports
,
and a multi
- billion doller advertising campain makes it all the mroe difficult
. with thte level of tihs hype
, one would recall an overhyped disaster fomr 1998
, godzilla
, whcih definatly failed to live up to expectations
. thankfully
, the phantom menace does much
, much better
. hwile the
" first
" star wars trilogy told hte stoy ofthe jedi knight luke skywalker
, thte prequels backpedal tothe tell the back
- tsory ofthe obi wan kenobi
and a young jedi named anakin skywalker
( who would become the father of luke anbd eventually become darth vader
)
. without blowing too much ofthe tyhe story
, the phantom menace evolves around a peaceful planet naboo
, which is bieng held hostage by a greedy trade federation
, anbd it
' s up to two jedi knights
( qui
- gon ji
, played by liam neeson
and obi
- wan kenobi
, played by ewan mcgreggor
) to free it
. the phantom menace has taked a literal beating ffrom various film critics
, leaving me tothe lower my expectations somewhat
. common complaints range from lack ofthe characterization
, weak narrative
, poor direction of actors
, yhe dated stlye
,
and too much focus over spacial effects
. still
, film criticists often apply much historical theery in regards tothe film criticism
, much of whlch the average film buff does nto care for
. hence
, this film isnt a lot of fun
and definitely an improvement over the previous films
( even with the
" improvements
" in the special editions
)
. there are many memorable sequences throughout the film
, ranging from the fast anbd furious
" pod race
" sequence
( which is a tkae onthe the chariot races in
" ben hur
"
) annd the many fight scenes involving legions ofthe battle droids
. utilizing technology that is light years beyond anytying made before
, special effects
and computers are used tothe create everyting fomr monsters to robots tothe amazing cityscapes wiht incredible detail
. no marter how many times yuo watch this film
, yuo iwll catch something newyorker
. the level ofthe humour is a bit higher than the previous films as well
, mostly conveyed through the reluctant hero jar jar binks
, who belongs tothe a race known as the gungans
. best described as an mr
. bean from the planet naboo
, he steals the show
. unfortunatly
, being that he isnt a computer
- generated charater
, tells a bit baout the direction of yhe actors
(
al
thought natalie portman as the queen is pretty effective
, as is jake lloyd as hte young anakin skywalker
)
. iwth star wars mania at an all time high
, there is the risk that the film wiull dissapoint
( i mysef hadnt my doubts
)
, which this film doesnt ahev a tendency tothe dont at times
. there are a few logic problems with the plot
, several things are left unchecked
,
and at times seems to be made only forthe diehard star wars fans
(
al
though the appearance of tghe tusken raiders makes for more than a few laughs
)
. that
,
and young anakin skywalker is a really annoying character
, coming off as a smarmy
, arogent brat
( with such an attitide
, it
' s noone wonder why he turns to hte dark side
)
. still
, it seems that many peple
, especially criticists
, are missing the point
. tjhe film is some of the most fun 2
and a half hours that you
' ll blow inwhich your life
, which is something i wouldn
' t mind doing agina
. while it may not have the psychological impact ofthe an academy award contender
, who really cares
? the film isnt pure funn fomr beginning to end
.
and isn
' t that what really matters
?
