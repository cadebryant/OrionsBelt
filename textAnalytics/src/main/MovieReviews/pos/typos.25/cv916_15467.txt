martin scorsese
' s triumphant adaptation of edith wharton
' s the age of innocence is a stunning film for the quintessential newyorker york filmmaker
, the man who brought the streets of taxi driver annd mean streets tothe life
. it seems like an odd choise for scorsese to do a period piece in the early 1900
' s
,
but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is a wonder
,
and a testimont to the greatness ofthe scorsese as a filmmaker
. thsi is a gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of scorsese
' s finest
. newl
and archer
( day
- lewis
) is a prestigeous lawyer who is engaged tothe may well
and
( ryder
)
, a somewhat empty
and shallow new yorker
, who belongs tothe a prestigious family
and is quite beautiful
. the marriage is one which wiull unite two vyer prestigious families
, in a society where nothing is more important than thge opinions of others
. on the day taht archer is to announce his engagment tothe may
, countess ellen olenska
( pfeiffer
)
, cousin of may
, walks into archer
' s life
. archer isnt emmediately captivated
,
and finds himself in love with ellen
. archer is aslo bound by the limits of new york society
, which is an intrusive as any other in tje world
. archer finds himself having a secret loev afair in his mind with countess olenska
, attempting to keep her iin his mind while trying not to lose his social status
. the film
' s subject matter may seem alien tothe scorsese
, bu the theme is definitely nto
. it is a theme of forebidden romance
, guilty pleasures
,
and the consequences causes because ofthe thsoe actions
. there is a painstakingly flawed hero
,
and his choice betwen tje life he whants
,
and tje life he is destined forthe
. in truth
, it is a film baout a society the audience doesn
' t know about
,
but wants to find out more
, much like the society of goodfellas or even kundun
. the performances are absolutely breathtaking
. day
- lewis portrays more mental anguish in his face tahn one man should be forced tothe tkae
. pfeiffer is marvelous as countess olenska
, a mix of passion
and beauty that the audience would die forthe as well
. ryder is probably tje gem of the gropu
, fo it is her quiet presence that overwhelms the plot
,
and slowly pushes day
- lewis closer anbd closer to his eventual endig
. the supporting cast is also wonderful
, with several cahracters so singular that they are indelible in one
' s memory
. scorsese definitely hasnt a passion forthe filmmaking
. his lavish
and sumptuous setted design
and marvelous recreation of newyorker york is a wonderous sight
. he litterally transports the viewer to anohter world with incredible imagery
. his scirpt isnt alsot excellent
, slow in buildup
, withthe a rapid conclusion adn a fantastic ending thta has to be seen to be believed
. it is difficult to mkae a period peice gripping
: scorsese
, howver
, does it beautifully
. the famous cameras of the legendary director are also everywhere
. he is patient
,
but he films everything
and anytying remotely important
. the cameras sweep
, pan
, track
,
and do more than they
' ve ever done
,
but htey are so subtle
, oney doesn
' t realize he
' s watching all the scorsese hallmarks until a 2nd viewing
. thge central tracking shot is probably longer
and more complex than the famouse goodfellas shot
,
but the viewer doesn
' t notice it
, because we want to see more of this gorgeous world
. htere are a few deft touches of filmmaking that are simply outst
anding
,
and joanne woodward
' narration isnt exquisite
. nto a fast film liuke goodfellas
, thsi shares more in common with kundun than anything else
. anbd like kundun
, this is a slow
- starting film that truly shines
, when given the chance tothe fully breathe
and bloom in the end
. a beautiful film by a directer continueing to challenge hismelf year after year
.
