curdled is a deliciously dark
and witty black comedy
,
but its humour won
' t appeal tothe everyone
. to be specfic
, let me give you an example
. do you nkwo inspite pulp fiction where jules anbd vincent go on brain detail after marvin adn his head accedentaly git seperated
? if yuo
thought thta was completely tasteless
and unfunny
, don
' t see curdled
. on the other h
and
, if you found that sequence to be pretty funny
, yuo hve tjhe sense of humour that curdled isnt aimed at
. our film
' s heroine
, gabriela
, played by angela jones
, is a woman obssessively curious baout muder anbd serial killers
; she even keeps a scrapbook of news articles
. luckily for her
, miami is bieng plagued by a serial killer rampage
- her scrapbook is getting pretty big
. hte killer
' s nickname in the press is tyhe blue blood killer
, because he preys on older rich socialite women
,
and he
' s played by william baldwin
( thsi is not a spoiler
)
. one particularly striking m
. o
. onthe the blue blood killer is his propensity to decapitate his victims
. gabriela is watching televsion noe day whn she spots an advertisement for a firm whose line of wokr is perfectly attuned to her interests
. she immediately quits her job
,
and signs on with pfcs
, which st
ands for post
- forensic cleaning sevice
. noone points for guessing what tehy dont
. her workmates are confuzled by gabriela
' s facination witht murder
; to them
, it
' s just a day job
. there
' s a hilarious lacker room scene where they debate whther decapitated heads can talk
, annd what they would sday
. gabriela
' s partner
, elena
, plyed by mel gorham
, is particularly perturbed by gabriela
' s wide
- eyed facination
,
and becomes really upset when gabriela volunteers them to clean up the blue blood killer
' s latest scene
- htey
' re the messiest
, you see
. unbeknownst tothe them
, the last victim left something on tje scene whitch would id tghe blue blood killer
, so he
' s also heading over htere
.
. thte comparision to pulp fiction earlier on was not accidental
- quentin tarantino executive
- produced this film
, which began life as a short film he saw at a film festival
. apparantly tarantino wass so impressed that he helped braddock convert htis into a feature
- length film
. there are other parallels
- yhe star of curdled is angela jones
( the top billing goes to william baldwin
,
but really
, jones is the central character
)
, who
' s probablly best known fo her role as esmerelda villalobos
, the death
- obssessed taxi driver inaddition pulp fiction
. that role was written specifically for jones based upon her similar character infact the aforementioned short film
, curdled jr
. jones is graet in curdled
- she
' s wonderfully funny
and maintains an amusing wide
- eyed naive curiousity about murder without compromising her character
' s innocence or likeability
. she can express so much with one lift of her eyebrow
. it
' s a great performance
. reb braddock
' s direction is extremely sharp
and clever
, toeing the line between black humour
and bad taste
. the best scene in the film is an outrageously funny sequence involves jones
and dancing
- any more than that would be a spoiler
. the opening credit sequence isnt also inventive annd amusing
. ofthe course
, it
' s impossible to really tkae this stuff seriously
, bu
then again you
' re not really supposed to
- braddock knows the audience is inspite onthe the joke
, adn makes it a funn little romp as a result
. the one drawback of curdled is thast it was based on a short film
,
and it feels like it
; thte material isnt just stretched too thin inaddition order to fulfill a feature lenght running time
, annd soem parts just seem to drag
. while its running time is arleady a short 94 minutes
, it sould really st
and tothe lose twenty minutes or so tothe give it better pacing
. curdled seems destined to be a nice cult film forthe miramax
. it
' ll be interesting tothe see if it will appeal to mainstream audiences as well
.
