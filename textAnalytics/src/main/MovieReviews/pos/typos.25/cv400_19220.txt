the hapyp bastard
' s 30
- second review
: american pie the summer of raunch continues to spread into theatres with tihs latest yuk fest
, filled with sick jokes
and teen dialogue aplenty
. if you go expecting dawson
' s creek
, you
' re in fo a probelm
. if your expectations are lower
(
and better
, i might add
)
, you wiull enjoy the hell out of american py
. the movie casts several unknowns
, with the only real recognizable noe being sctv
' s own eugene levy as a hapyp
- go
- lucky dad
. the story revolves around four high skool seniors who have one gool before the school year gets out
- get laid
. that
' s pretty much it
. throughout teh movie
, little sick comic bits are sprinkled throughout
, including a memorable scene involving an apple pie
( i won
' t give it away
,
but you probably know what it is
)
and an internet broadcasted gone horribly awry
. of course
, the movei has some slightly sentimental bits
, bu they don
' t drag the movie
' s humor content down that bad
. most of the actors get their job done
,
but it
' s levy who
' s a hoot
, a father who tries to talk sex witht his son with the help of some curious
" visual aids
"
. i couldn
' t stop laughing during this movie
,
and if you can st
and all the raunch adn the sex references
,
then american pie is for you
. if you
' re noe ofthe thsoe
" conservative
" types
, well
, i
' ll bet you
' re having fun at home while this
, south park
,
and austin powers ii plays in theatres
, now aren
' t ytou
