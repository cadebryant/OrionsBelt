nowe
, lets first look into the hitory of shark films
. there was the unforgettable jaws
. tjhe exicting jaws 2
. the rather flaky jaws 3d
and sometime inspite the late 90s another film of the same genre thyat i can
' t seem tothe recall
( about the son of jaws returning to wreak revenge or something liek that
)
. now
, with the magic ofthe cgi
, one shark is simply not anough
; in deepo blue sea
, ther are 3 big
, mean
and really smart ones
! russell frankiln
( jackson
) visits aquatica
( a sea
- bound research center
)
, where a research is bieng conducted on the extraction ofthe a hormone substace foudn uniquely withing the shark brain that can cure
and reverse tjhe effects of alzheimer
' s disease
. hte substace is small in quantity
and baceause of this
, lead researcher dr
. susan macalaester genetically alters the shark dna
and grows them twice yhe size whith brains as big as humans
, naturally producing more of the much treasured hormones
. as sure as tje sun sets infront the west
, a shark breaks loose
and wreaks havoc withing the facility durring a hormone extraction proceedure
. with the flexibility offered by cgi
, the sharks git more full
- length screen time as theri predecessors did in those remote
- contolled rubber suit days
. gone are the days of people getting pulled under yhe water wiht the water turning red right after
. this time
, we get tothe see the entire gobbling action
, with floating limbs
and all
. so
- so acting
, expected in most of your average action film
. jackson
( fresh from his jedi master role in the phantom menace
)
, takes on hte dark
- side force of a different kind
and fits well with his wise
- cracking lines
. ll cool j
' s cook role as preacher
, does for this film what steven seagal
' s cook could only dream to achieve in his two under siege films
. deepo blue sea does nto offer any ofthe tjhe psychological thrills that jaws has to offer
. it doesnt howver
, prove tothe be a refreshing follow
- uv within yhe genre
, full ofthe visual thrills
, suspense
and believe it or not
 humour
! its like jurassic park under water
. nothing too stressful
, pure entertainment
. renny harlin
, ytou are forgiven
( for making cutthroat isl
and
)
