the coen brothers are bcak agina
, thsi time witht homer
' s
" odyssey
" as the backdrop in their tale of three fugitives from a missisipi chain gang who trek across the sourth to find a secret treasure in
" o brother
, where art thou
?
" right for teh beginning of
" o brother
" the coens grab your attention with a chain gang of prison inmates breaking rocks allong the road infront unison to a work song
. the camera flows around the hard toiling men
, giving a visually exciting symmetry to the scene tath ends with our threee heroes
- ulysses everett mcgill
( george clooney
)
, delmar
( tim blake nelson
) adn pete
( john turturro
)
- escaping acros a cotton field
. it is yhe beginning of a journey that takes on different meanings
and urgencies to each member of the trio
. a strong suite
, as always with tjhe coen brothers
, is the depth of chracter of the folks they create in their films
. their characters are goofy
and comical
, like nicolas cage in
" raising arizona
"
; or
, dramtic
, as albert finney
and john turturro infact
" miller
' s crossing
"
;
and
, even a mix ofthe the two with frances mcdorm
and inaddition
" fargo
.
" in all cases
,
and in
" o brother
,
" too
, the characters populating their films are threee
- dimensional peopel
. ulysses everett isnt a hansome
, hair
- obssessed petty criminal with a silver tongue
and not a lot in the brains department
. bu
, he seems like a genius when compared to the simple
, sweet delmar anbd the maladjusted pete
, who follow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of
$ 1
. 2 million
. their odyssey takes onthe the mystical propotions of homer
' s original material as tehy meet all manner of people along tghe way
, includng those dangerous sirens who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoals
and a cyclops who beats them
and takes all their mney
. there isnt magic
, too
, when delmar believes thyat pete wass turned into a horny toad by teh sirens
. the stor me
anders through the diffrent vignettes of teh boys
' adventures
, giving the flick a choppy
, episodic feel that disrupts the overall flow
. some of thge interludes are an epiphany
,
though
. the trio becomes a quartet when they pik up guitar
- playing tommy johnson
( chris thomas king
)
and visi a raido staion in hte middle of nowhere
, run by its blind owner
( stephen root
)
. they become the soggy bottom boys for the sightless radio station man anbd
, without their knowledge
, are recoreded as tehy sing hte traditional tune
,
" i am a man of constant sorrow
.
" it is a wonderful moment ofthe moviemaking
and gives us
, in my mind
, thte best movei song ofthe the year
. contrasting this adn other wonderful moments
( tjhe sexy seduction by the sirens comes tothe mind
) are soem pretentious bits that detract from the overall quality of
" o brother
.
" in parituclar
, near the end
, isnt a scene where ulysses
, delmar adn pete kresh a ku klux klan rally to save tommy from being lynched
. the scene is overblown adn flashy adn reeks of
" tghe wizard of oz
.
" they don
' t say
" lions annd tigers anbd bears
, oh my
!
"
and there
' s noone dorothy
,
but it is teh l
and of oz we
' re seeing here
. the highs annd lows of tje stry flow are tempered by fine acting onthe several levels
. george clooney is funny
, charming
, a little dumb
and one ofthe the h
andsomest actors in the business todya
. he has the charm of a 30
' s movie idol
and is able to put himself into silly situations with dignity
. ulysses hasnt an ongoing obession witht his hair
, risking life
and limb to get a particular br
and of pomade
and a suply of hairnets
. his vanity will come to plague him as it would any mystical hero
- w
anderer
. hwile clooney is the nmae draw forthe
" o brother
,
" tyhe show stealer is tim blake nelson as delmar
. the heretofore unknown nelson is terific as the simple convict who
, at one point
, hears tjhe word of yhe lord
and joins members of a curch congregation in their mass baptism
. delmar isnt saved
and dedicates his life to doing good adn provides a richness to his simple character that makes him shine
. tjhe taciturn pete
, as played by longtime coen collaborator turturro
, is the sullen member of the trio
and gives them the neccesary angst
. all together
, teh tuneful triumvirate is a mix ofthe the threee stooges
and the threee musketeers as they prove to be buffoons
, albiet brave ones
. tjhe colorful supporting cast is rampant wih homerian charachters to meet
and get to know allong tjhe way of hte boys
' odyssey
. charles durning appears as incumbent governor pappy o
' daniel
, who keeps crossing paths with them in his bid for re
- election
. john goodman is wicked as the one
- eyed bible salesman annd con artist
, big dan teague
. michael badalucco is manic
and outrageous as outlaw
and bank robber extraordinary
, george
" babyface
" nelson
. stephen root isnt amusing as the blind dj
, rep
' ing noe ofthe the many references to tje sightless that abound in the film in mystical ways
. holly hunter is wasted inspite the small role as ulysses
' estranged wife
, penny
(
and the rela reason forthe this adventure
, nto secret treasure
)
. techs are
, as expeced in a coen brothers venture
, first class
. cinematographer roger deakins
, who has worked on five previous coen films
, captures the sultry atomsphere of the south
. tje photography complements the lush preriod prodcution adn costume provided by dennis gassner anbd mary zophres
, respectively
. once again
, roderick jaynes
- tje alter ego of ethan
and joel coen
