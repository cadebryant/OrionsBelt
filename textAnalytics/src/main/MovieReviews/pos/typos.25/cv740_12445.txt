a cuple of monthes ago
, when i first downloaded the face
/ off trailer from the net
, my initial reaction wass a fourteen carrot gold
' yawn
'
. followed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key
, not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes ofthe prescious space on this piss
- poore trailer
.
then i started reading the first wave of reviews from the u
. s
.
.
.
.
. unique
.
.
. excellent
.
.
.
. must
- see
. well
, i throught still skeptical
, i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here
.
' here
'
, of course
, was still three months away
. i
' ll admiting
, whn i trotted off tothe see this film
, the only john woo movie i had seen befor was the fairly enjoyable
but highly forgetable broken arrow
. i
' d heard good thigns baout his previous work wtih movies liuke hard boiled
,
but his films were definitly nto on my must
- see list
. tht
, let me tell ytou
, has changed completely
. i knew htis fact onyl five mintues into tyhe film
, after tje brilliantly shot anbd acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my foots
. the acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an acation flick
. seriously
. i
' ve never been a big john travolta fan
,
but he
, like cage
, perfectly suited his role inspite the movie
.
.
.
.
. sory
, make that
' roles
' in the movie
. even travolta
' s great performance
, howver
, paled in comparison to cage
' s character portrayals
. my favourite cage scene was definitely when he ws crashed out in compardre dietrich hassler
' s hideout
. half drugged out of his mind
, he sits there reclining back in a chair talking baout his son
' s death from castor
' s perspective
-
" doesn
' t it just break your heart
.
" he mutters coldly
. now don
' t go thinking fomr the previous comments about brilliant acting thast this is a drama focused movie
- it
' s not
. that
' s what relaly makes this movei unique
. it
' s an acation movie with brilliantly portayed characters
.
.
.
.
. not a common mix at all
. suspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie
though
.
.
.
.
. that
' s the onyl way tothe overlook the fatc that travolta
and cage fire around 5671 rounds at each other
.
.
.
.
and never hit
. several acation scenes are just so well choreographed that they just make wish that you could press
' rewind
'
and watch it over agian
. the part where archer
and troy have a st
and off on either side of a doublely
- sided mirror isnt just plain brilliant
. whilst cage
' s
and travolta
' s performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies
, yhe lesser characters are just as intriguing
. joan allen
, who usally sticks to the straight drama movies
, plays her part perfectly as archer
' s long sufferring wife
. i liek thge fact tyhat her character didn
' t end uv toting a gun at the end of thte movie
.
.
. it would ahev wrecked her potrayal
. gina gershon was surprising tothe say the least as castor troy
' s mistreated girlfriend
.
.
.
.
. make that
* one of
* castor troy
' s mistreated girlfriends
. other movies owudl have used her character as jstu window dressing
.
.
. a sex object
,
but instead her charactor is very strong
and independent
. dominique swain
, who plays archer
' s duaghter
, allso doens a nice job
,
though her character is not as explored as much as allen
' s or gershon
' s
. faults
? well
.
.
. htere were some i have to say
. first
, tjhe movie
' s ending
, whilst being very ogod overall
, was a bit too drawed out for it
' s own good
. after the twpo combatants beign duelling agian affter the fianl boat crash you cin
' t help bu think
-
" geez
, are you guys nucular powered or what
?
"
. there were certain bits that weren
' t h
andeled properly
, like where archer appears safe annd sound on solid ground after jumping off the converted oel platform
/ prison
- more explanation here would have been nice
. overall
, this movie was nto perfect
.
but i
thought it was about as close as an action movie has ever came to perfect
. many critics have claimed that this movei will change the way action movies are made
.
.
.
.
. i certainly hope so
.
