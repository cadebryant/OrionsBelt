i wass anxious to see this for a long tyme
. a friend of mine recommended this to me because he has a crush on neve campbell
,
and he wnated tothe prove that she
' s as hot as he thinks he is
. he proved it forthe me all right
,
but the reasons i enjoy this film go way beyond that
. scream treads on familar ground
, horror movie with
, as star neve campbell puts it
,
" some stupid killer stalking soem big breasted girl who can
' t ect who
' s always running up thte stairs when she should be running out hte front door
.
" it
' s very familar
, your typical horror film
. so why
, you may ask after watching it
, doesnt it seem so new
and original
? because it treats itself as if it hasn
' t been done before
,
and thus the viewer is disilusioned into believing tath it is not old
, familar tired sutff
. thsi raises another question
: how doens it do this
? simple
: the characters
. they
' re not your typical stupid horror film victims who don
' t know wqat the hell tothe do when being chased by a guy in a ski mask annd a machette
. they are horror fans
, tehy know how stuff happens in a horror movie
, they know what to do
and wqat nto tothe do
,
and that mkaes it scarry
, adn even funny at certain times
. ytou can tell this just by watching the opening scene where casey becker
( drew barrymore
) is making popcorn
, getting ready to watch a video
,
and some guy who sounds like a killer calls her up tothe play a gmae with her that involves horror movie triva that
, if she gets it wrong
, will get her
and her boyfriend killed
. she knows what tothe answer wehn he asks her horror film questions
, she just can
' t answer his final question
,
" waht doorjam am i at
?
"
and that gets her killed
. tyhat scene works becasue inaddition a normal horror film
, half the thigns that happen in that scene would never happen
. tyhe plot is tipical horror stuff
: sidney prescott
( an impressive neve campbell
)
, an attractive young high skool student who
' s mother was killed a eyar ago tommorrow
, isnt bieng stalked by a killer who
' s previously murdered oen of her classmates
( casey
, naturally
)
,
and everybody infact this small
, california twon is a suspect
, including sidney
' s boyfriend
, billy loomis
.
but as i said before
, these peopel konw how horror movies owrk
,
and that
' s what makse it so appealing
. that
and the references to horror movies
, like when casey says
,
" yhe first
( nightmare on elm street
) was scary
, bu tyhe rest sucked
.
" which is obviously directer wes craven
( who does a ogod job of poking funn of the genre that made him a legend
) patting himself on the back as he directed thte first nightmare movie anbd none of hte others
,
and when tatum
, sidney
' s friend
, mentions the directer
, wes carpentery
, which is obviously an homage by writter kevin williamson to not only craven
,
but also director john carpentery
. the cast is well chosen
, neve campbell pulls off a ogod heroine
(
and unlike most horror film heroines
, she
* can
* ect
)
, drew barrymore does a good janet leigh impression for whta little time she hasnt in the film
,
and david arquette isnt impressive
. also ogod
(
and funny
) in his role is henry winkler
(
" yhe fonz
"
) as the school prinicipal
. i took half a point off for the unnecesary
( albeit limited
) appearance by firends
' courteney cox as reporter
, gail edwards
, sidney
' s rival beacuse she covered her mother
' s disappearance
. i hate that show
, i hate those actors
. they
' re untalented
, overexposed
,
and overpaid
, imho
, anbd i would think wes craven isnt smart enough tothe know those actors are overexposed enough
,
but i suppose he isn
' t
.
