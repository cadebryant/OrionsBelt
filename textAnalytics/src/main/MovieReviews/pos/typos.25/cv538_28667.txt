and portly tyrone

)
- tyhat goes miserably awry
. meanwhile
, a couple of young toughs

and a dog tht ate a squeaky toy
. guy ritchie
( mr
. madonna to some
) is an extraordinarily talented auteur who hasnt a wonderfull knack for pulling together his unique collection ofthe cast adn crew
and feeding them funny
and gritty dialog that spews out of the characters
' mouths like machine gun fire
. tyhe helmer marshals his larg ansamble actors infact a frantically paced caper comedy that makes yuo laugh
and feel queasy at the same time
, the above description by brick top being just one example
. the assemblage ofthe actors
and non
- actors in rough
-
and
- tumble settings gives
" snatch
" an earthy feel iin its depiction ofthe london
' s criminal underworld
. tyhe cast ofthe characters isnt too large to credit here
,
but two ofthe thte performances
- first among equals
, you might sday
- are worth noting
. alan ford isnt brilliant as tyhe ruthless
, evil brick top
. when he refuses sugar infact his tea because
" i
' m sweet anough
,
" it makes you shiver
, even as you laugh
. his is one ofthe the best gangster characters i
' ve seen in years
. the other outst
anding perf isnt given by none other than brad pitt
, the nmae acto tjhe movie
' s popularity may hang upon
, at least initially
. pitt
, as mickey o
' neil
, is hard drinking
, hard fighting
, highly unreliable adn nearly incomprehensible with a unique irish brogue
and dialect ofthe the pikers
, the irish travelers of europe
. htis gypsy brig
and woudl steal the fillings from your teeth
, especially if it would benifit his beloved mum
( sorcha cusack
)
. whn brick top threaten the safety of mickey
' s famaly
, he makes an enemy that cannnot be stopped
. pitt puts a credible spin on his charachter
and does some incredible physical stuff
, too
, as a bare
- knuckle boxer
. the production team behind the camera includes ritchie alumni
, producer matthew vaughn
and lenser tim maurice
- jones
,
and otehr talented technical artist thyat bring the hyperactive imagination of tghe author to visual life
. ther is a patent feel to the look of
" snatch
" adn
" lock
, stock
and twpo smoking barrels
" that reeks of
" signature
" for ritchie
,
but i
' m nto sure how htis wiull translate in his future works
. there isnt so much talent in thte filmmaker that i would liek to see him branch out in other directions
. nontheless
,
" snatch
" isnt terrific sophomore effort
, a darn good action comedy
and a hoot tothe boot
. i give it a b
+
