, sol
( lennie james
)
and portly tyrone
( ade
)
- that goes miserably awry
. meanwhile
, a cuple ofthe young toughs
, turkish
( jason stratham
)
and tommy
( stephen graham
)
, are trying to break inspite to the boxing game with teh halp of local villain brick top

anbd a dog that ate a squeaky toy
. guy ritchie
( mr
. madonna to some
) is an extraordinarily talented auteur who has a wonderful knack for pulling toghether his unique collection of cast
and crew
anbd feeding them funny
and gritty dialouge thgat spews out of the characters ' mouths like machine gun fire
. the helmer marshals his large ensemble actors in a frantically paced caper comedy that makes you laugh
and feel queasy at the smae time
, the above description by brick top being jstu one example
. the assemblage of actors
annd non
- actors in rough
-
and
- tumble settings gives
" snatch
" an earthy fiel in its depiction of london ' s criminal underworld
. the cast of characters is too large to credit here
,
bu two ofthe the performances
- first among equals
, you might say
- are worth noting
. alan ford isnt brillant as the ruthless
, evil brick top
. whn he refuses sugar in his tea because
" i ' m sweet enought
,
" it makes you shiver
, even as you laugh
. his is one of the best gangster characters i ' ve seen in years
. the other outstanding perf is given by none other than brad pitt
, the name actor the movei ' s popularaty may hang upon
, at least initially
. pitt
, as mickey o ' neil
, is hard drinking
, hard fighting
, highly unreliable
and nearly incomprehensible withthe a unique irish brogue
and dialect of the pikers
, the irish travelers of europe
. this gypsy brigand owudl steal the fillings from your teeth
, expecially if it would benefit his beloved mum
( sorcha cusack
)
. whn brick top threaten tyhe safty ofthe mickey ' s family
, he makes an enemy thyat cannot be stoped
. pitt puts a credible spin on his character
anbd does some increadible physical sutff
, too
, as a bare
- knuckle boxer
. tjhe production team behind hte camera includes ritchie alumni
, producer matthew vaughn
and lenser tim maurice
- jones
,
and other talented technical artist that bring the hyperactive imagination of the author tothe visual life
. there is a patent feel to the look of
" snatch
"
adn
" lock
, stock
adn two smoking barrels
" that reeks of
" signature
" forthe ritchie
,
but i ' m not sure how tihs will translate in his future works
. there is so much talent in tyhe filmmaker that i would liek to see him branch out inaddition other directions
. nonetheless
,
" snatch
" is terrific sophomore efort
, a darn good acation comedy
and a hoot to boot
. i give it a b
