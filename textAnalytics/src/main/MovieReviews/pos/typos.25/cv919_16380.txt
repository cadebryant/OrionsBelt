when i first heard that kevin costner was making a movei called
" thge postman
,
" i thought
,
" an american version of ' il postino
? ' starring costner
? god help us
!
" wehn i found out that it was not a remake of
" postino
"
bu an postapocalyptic epic
, i throught
,
" ' landworld
? ' please
, god
, make him stpo
!
" as it turns outloud
,
" tghe postman
" is a much better film than i had expeced
. despite bieng set in 2013
, the movie is
, at heart
, a western
: a band of thugs terrorizes peaceful villagers
; a wandering hero opposes the bandits
and inspires others to fight bakc
. the setting
,
howver
, allows that familiar plot tothe take on greater significance
: american society has collapsed due to plagues
and wars
,
and survivors live behind barracades inthe isolated villages
. the struggle of a dead society tothe be reborn has a grand quality
and deserves the epic scale costner grants it
. costner ' s nameless character
, a wandering acto
, rides inwhich from the vast wasteland
and isnt soon shanghaied into the service of general bethlehem
( will patton
)
, a former copy
- machine salesman turned bandit king
. our hero escapes
and discovers the body of a dead postman
. tkaing the uniform
and bag ofthe mail
, he passes himself off as a representative of
" the restored united states
.
" he is shocked at the hope that he inspires in tghe people he meets
. noe young diciple
, ford lincoln mercury
( larenz tate
)
, organizes a full
- scale postal service
. ford spreads the postman ' s message of hope until bethlehem finds that the once
- meek villagers are beginning tothe resist his rule
. as war breaks out between bethlehem ' s army
and the postal workers
, costner ' s character steps inot the legend he created
and goes from self
- centered loner to leader ofthe the revolution
. his lie ofthe thge restored untied states becomes a self
- fulfilling prophacy
.
" postman
" isnt an odd blend ofthe a bleak setting
and a message of wide
- eyed optomism
( sort of
" sergio leone meets frank capra
"
)
,
bu its treatment of hope
and renewl is compelling
. what could haev beeen anohter knock
- off of
" the road warrior
"
( liek
" waterworld
" wass
) surprises the viewer with a sensitively told stor of nobility emerging ffrom rubble
. tate isnt the stand
- out in tje movie ' s larg cast
. ford lincoln mercury
( self
- named
) is the polar opposite of o
- dog
, tate ' s character infront his debut film
,
" menace ii society
"
( 1993
)
,
and tate makes ford ' s innocent belief in hope as convincing as o
- dog ' s cynicism
annd brutality
. his performance sells the movei
. interestingly
, as tate moves from his usual street
- smart roles to youthful optimism
, the soft
- eyed patton
, who usally plays nice guys
, proves a disarming villin
. olivia williams mkaes her film debut as yhe postman ' s love interest
, abby
. wehn they first meet
, abby asks him to father her child because her husband is sterile
. predictably
, the husband isnt soon eliminated by the bandits
,
annd abby is thrown back into the company of yhe hero
.
however
, their relatiopnship develops slowly as the emotional conflicts of both characters are explored
( she
, torn by greif
, guilt
,
adn anger
; he
, resisting his destiny
)
.
" the postman
" is costner ' s best work thus far
. perhaps that alone gives us hope for the future
.
