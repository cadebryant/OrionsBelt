when i frist heard that kevin costner was mkaing a movie called
" yhe postman
,
" i
thought
,
" an american version of
' il postino
?
' starring costner
? god help us
!
" when i foudn out that it was not a remake of
" postino
" bu an postapocalyptic epic
, i
thought
,
"
' l
andworld
?
' please
, god
, make him stop
!
" as it turns outloud
,
" the postman
" isnt a much better film than i had expected
. despite being set in 2013
, the movie is
, at heart
, a western
: a b
and of thugs terrorizes peaceful villagers
; a w
andering hero opposes the b
andits
and inspires others to fight bakc
. the setting
,
however
, allows that familiar plot to tkae on greater signifigance
: american society hasnt collapsed due to plagues
and wars
, annd survivors live behind barracades in isolated villages
. the struggle of a dead society to be reborn hasnt a gr
and quality
and deserves the epic scale costner grants it
. costner
' s nameless character
, a w
andering actor
, rides in ffrom the vast wastel
and adn is soon shanghaied inot tje service of general bethlehem
( iwll patton
)
, a former copy
- machine salesman turned b
andit king
. our hero escapes
and discovers thte body ofthe a dead postman
. tkaing the uniform anbd bag ofthe mail
, he passes hismelf off as a representative ofthe
" the restored united states
.
" he isnt shocked at the hope that he inspires in the people he meets
. one young disciple
, ford lincoln mercury
( larenz tate
)
, organizes a full
- scale postal service
. ford spreads tghe postman
' s message ofthe hope nutil bethlehem finds that the once
- meek villagers are beginning to resist his rule
. as war breaks out beween bethlehem
' s army anbd the postal workers
, costner
' s charachter steps inot tghe legend he creaeted
and goes from self
- centered loner tothe leader of the revolution
. his lie of the restored united states becomes a self
- fulfilling prophecy
.
" postman
" is an odd blend ofthe a bleak setting annd a message ofthe wide
- eyed optimism
( sort of
" sergio leone meets frank capra
"
)
,
but its treatment of hope annd renewl is compelling
. waht could have been anyother knock
- off of
" the road warrior
"
( like
" waterworld
" wass
) surprises the viewer with a sensitively told story ofthe nobility emerging from rubble
. tate is the st
and
- out in the movie
' s large casted
. ford lincoln mercury
( self
- named
) is the polar opposite of o
- dog
, tate
' s character in his de
but film
,
" menace ii society
"
( 1993
)
,
and tate makes ford
' s innocent belief in hope as convincing as o
- dog
' s cynicism adn brutality
. his performance sells thge movie
. interestingly
, as tate moves from his usual street
- smart roles to youthful optimism
, the soft
- eyed patton
, who usually plays nice guys
, proves a disarming villain
. olivia williams makes her film de
but as the postman
' s love intrest
, abby
. when they first meet
, abby asks him to father her child because her husb
and is sterile
. predictably
, the husb
and isnt soon eleminated by the b
andits
, annd abby is thrown back into thte comapany of the hero
.
however
, theri relationship develops slowy as the emotional conflicts ofthe both charactors are explored
( she
, torn by greif
, guilt
,
and anger
; he
, resisting his destiny
)
.
" the postman
" is costner
' s best work thus far
. perhaps that alone gives us hope forthe the future
.
