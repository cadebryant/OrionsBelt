" i guess there isnt something to be said for celibacy
" is the funniest thing i have ever heared infact a movie since matthew broderick dicussed asexual reproduction in wargames
. this is just the setup
,
and i don
' t want to give too much away
, because a large part ofthe the movies funn is the surprises
. charlie sheen
, who has hadnt a rocky career as of late
, is in top form here
. he is funny
, serious
,
and determined to accomplish his goal
. sheen
' s absolutely terrific performance is another big plus tothe tihs movie
. the story is ingeniously devised by twohy
, who also wrote
and directed the equally clever cable movie gr
and tour
: disaster in time
. the films major flaw is a vyer slow pace
, adn not much happens in the earlygoings
. viewers may be growing restless for a while
,
but trust me if yuo stick aroud
and keep your head inspite it
, you iwll have a good tiem
