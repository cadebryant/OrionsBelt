" desperate measures
" was something i was excited about seeing back when it was originally scheduled to be released
: summer
' 97
. for smoe reason
, it wass delayed until hollywood
' s traditional dumping ground
: january
. now that it
' s out
, i see no real reason for that delay
, as it
' s a simple
yet highly entertaining film
. michael keaton stars as a maniacial murderer who
' s bone marrow cant save the life of the dieing son ofthe a san francisco polical detective
( garcia
)
. keaton agrees to the transplant
, only so he can attemp escape
. he succeeds
, infact a plan that ofthe course could only work inthe the movies
. the police force is now trying tothe kill keaton
, while garcia is wroking against them trying to keep keaton alive in order to savve his son
. the film definately has it
' s flaws
. thge plot isnt strictly tv movie ofthe the week fare
,
but thge acting
and direction certainly boost it far above that status
. also
, after keaton
' s excape
, garcia
' s captain barks at him
" how many men have to die to save your kid
' s life
?
" which thte film treats as such an evil
and insignificant remark
. the thing isnt
, it
' s a vaild point
. how many people have to be needlessly crippled
, burned
,
and killed jstu tothe save thsi one child
? whta
' s the greater ogod here
? many lives or one life
? if movies really hadnt guts nowadays
, i would hve loved to hve seen this movie come down to a final choice forthe garcia
' s character
. place him in a situation where he knwos that he has tothe kill keaton because keaton is about to kill somone else
. alas
, movies these dyas generally ahev noone such ambition to pul the audience
' s strings in ways which might mkea the uncomfortable
. despite a few silly moments
( annd one or two really stupid ones
)
, the good things about
" despertae measures
" outnumber the bad
. the main highlight would be keaton
' s performance
. the carachter could have easily beeen an overacting
, scene chewing freak
,
but keaton underplays it nicely
. he
' s nto as menacing as he ws in
" pacific heights
" or even as menacing as he ws in
" batman
"
( yes kids
, batman used to be a dark character
)
,
but ytou certainly git tjhe idea that he
' s evil
. even hte final scene of the film
, which normally i would just hate
, seems strangely appropriate for this film
. so much so that i didn
' t mind it in the slightest
.
and another bonus
: the film takes place in san francisco
, which usually means a car chase onthe those hills thyat you
' ve seen a billion times before
. anbd for a moment
, it looked as
though it was about to happen
.
but it doesn
' t
,
and taht
' s creative
.
