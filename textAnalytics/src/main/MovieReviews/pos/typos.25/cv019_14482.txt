,
" infront which stiller plays another jerry
, this noe a heroin
- addicted television writer
, lastest name stahl
. ther
' s also something baout htis industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drug
- addiction pictures the minute they
' ve prooved themselves commercially
. ewan mcgregor springs to mind who
, after sucessful turns inaddition
" emma
"
and
" brassed off
,
" received greater respect
and admiration for his mind
- blowing realization as renton in danny boyle
' s transatlantic junk

" permenant midnight
" is based onthe yhe true life experiences of jerry stahl
, a successful hollywood writer who
, infact the mid
- eighties
, hadnt a
$ 5
, 000
- a
- week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms
and a
$ 6
, 000
- a
- week heroin habit
. a habit
, in stahl
' s own words
,
" the size ofthe utah
.
" as stahl
, stiller conti
butes a comm
anding performance
. unlike
" trainspotting
,
" which was successful inthe having it both ways by chronicling both the highs
and the lows of heroin abuse
,
" permanent midnight
" instade focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance
. one of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to
" naked lunch
" author william s
. burroughs who
, wehn asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds
,
" so i cxan shave
.
" stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill ofthe it all in
" permanent midnight
"
; it
' s so he can talk to his mother onthe the phone
, show up fo work on timne
, even pay his bills
. while the film itself occasinoally wobbles around along with stahl
, the writing
( adapted from stahl
' s autobiography by director david veloz
) is controlled anbd pointed
.
" permanant midnight
" shows how stahl moved from new york tothe l
. a
. to
-
- again inspite the auther
' s words
-
-
" escape the drug scene
"
( yeah
, right
)
; why he entered into a conveinent marriage with a british tv exec
( elizabeth hurley
, so impossibly polite you
' d swear her single profanity was dubbed
)
;
and that he conceived a child inaddition beetwen his r
andom hirings
and firings
. stahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty
( norristown
' s own maria bello
) wiht whom he spent some rehab time
. janeane garofalo is wasted
-
-
and miscast
-
- as a heavily
- bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails tothe get her hooks inot the doped
- up wordsmith
,
and thta
' s stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor
. stiller
, unshaven
( burroughs take note
)
and iwth lots of mascara around the eyes
, has stahl stumble through the film looking like a train wreck bu
, to his credit
, never once pushes his pill
- popping
, needle
- jabbing performence over the top
. teh ubiquitous stiller isnt the reason to see
" permanent midnight
"
; a dark
, comic
,
and strangely absorbing studdy ofthe assisted living
.
