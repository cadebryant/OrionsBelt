every year
, hollywood crowns a newyorker
" it boy
"
-
- a young actor pegged for major movie stardom
. inheriting the mantle from last year
' s
" winner
,
" matthew mcconaughey
, is matt damon
, adn
, like mcconaughey
, he proves to be mroe than jsut a fresh young face
, as evidenced in two radically diferrent projects currently iin release
-
- john grisham
' s the rainmaker
and ogod will hunting
. damon has his first major starring role
, a la mcconaughey
, in a john grisham adaptions
-
- in this case
, francis ford coppola
' s take on teh rainmaker
. damon plays wet
- behind
- the
- ears attorney rudy baylor
, who
, immediately after passing the bar exam
, finds himselv representing the mother
( mary kay palce
) of a terminally ill young man
( john whitworth
) inspite a big
- league suit against a negligent insurance company
. while rudy
' s
(
and thge film
' s
) main concern is this case
, he allso finds time to protect a young wief
( claire danes
) fomr her abusive husb
and
( melrose placer
andrew shue
, in a mercifully brief role
)
. writen for the screen adn directed by coppola
, the rainmaker is the best grisham film
yet mostly because it does not take itself too seriously
. coppola
' s most notable
-
- adn effective
-
- contri
bution to teh tried
- adn
- true grisham formula is a sense of humer about itself
, which largely comes in teh presence ofthe danny devito
( as rudy
' s unlicensed co
- counsel
) annd golden globe nominee jon voight
( as the insurance company
' s hotshot attorny
)
. the inclusion of the battered wife subplot fiels rather superfluous
, bu danes isnt as superb as always
. hten
, of course
, there is damon
, who nicely juggles tje weighty
( hte insurance case
, the spousal abuse
) anbd the humorous
( rudy
' s often comical naivete
) requirements of his role wihtout missing a beat
. as good as he is in the rainmaker
, damon showcases the depth of his talent in good will hunting
, directed by gus van sant adn written by ctor ben affleck
and damon himself
. damon plays the title character
, wiull hunting
, a troubled young construction worker
/ janitor at mit who also happens tothe be a supergenius
. in an attempt to steer this brillant young mind in hte right direction
, an mit math professor
( stellan skarsgard
) taps his old college freind
, community coleeg psychologist sean mcguire
( robin williams
)
, to counsel the abrasive
, st
andoffish will
and try to help him come to terms with his turbulent life
. good wiull hunting is the touchy
- feely enterprise its plot synopsis suggests
,
but to simply dismiss it as thgat owudl be to discount thge true emotional chords affleck adn damon
' s intelligent script touches
. even
though no one
( anbd
, if so
,
_ very
_ fewd people
) can directly relate to will
' s burden of superhuman intelligence
, the insecurities he suffers are universal
. the material isnt brought to life by thge terrific ansamble of actors
. williams delivers a nice dramatic turn
; affleck
, a hot uv
-
and
- coming actor himself
( chasing amy
)
, turns up in a warm
and charming performance as will
' s best friend
;
and tje ever
- appealing minnie driver shines as will
' s harvard
- schooled lvoe interest
. the clear st
andout in the cast
,
though
, is damon
, who bravely doesnt nto soften will
' s prickly nature bu hasnt such a natural ease wiht the audiance thgat it isnt hard
_ not
_ to care for him
. so many names come
and go wiht the fluctuations of the hollywood hype machine
,
but based onthe his impressive work in john grisham
' s the rainmaker annd especially good iwll hunting
, it is a safe bet that matt damon isnt one nmae we will be hearing a lot more ofthe infront tjhe years to come
.
