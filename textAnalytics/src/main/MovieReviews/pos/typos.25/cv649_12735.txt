the promotion fo fear annd loathing in las vegas
? has made the film out to be a comedy
, annd for about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one
. it
' s 1971
,
and hte hippie movement hasnt left behind qutie a few wash
- outs
, amoung them journalist raoul duke
( johnny depp
)
and his
" attorney
" dr
. gonzo
( benito del toro
)
. theese two spend most of hte film in a drug
- induced stupor
, having strange hallucinations
, trashing their hotel rooms
,
and either annoying or scaring almost everyone that crosses their path
. duke is firt assigned to cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race inaddition las vegas
,
but gets lost in a blur of drugs
, beer
,
and flying dust
, anbd ends up w
andering around with noone clue who won
. he leaves vegas briefly before he is sent back
, in what can only be described as a strangely appropraite twist of fate
, to cover a drug enforcement conference
. fear adn loathing has beeen misinterpreted by some as glorifying the use of drugs
. it doesn
' t
, even in the beginning
-
- while the pair
' s antics are sometimes amusing annd relatively harmless at first
, the humor here is still fairly dark
. directer terry gilliam views them wtih a rether satrical eye
,
and even when we
' re laughing
, we
' re laughing at them rather than with them
. they spend most ofthe theri time paranoid
, angry
, or just plain befuddled
, which is propably an underst
andable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill up witht giant reptiles
. the black comedy may be entertaining to watch onscreen
, bu it
' s probablly not something most other audience munbers would want to exeprience first
- h
and
. all this asside
, i was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near its one
- hour mark
, thinking tothe myself that i wanted something more out of this thna jsut an off
- kilter satire of drug culture
. thankfully
, the script delivers it before too long
, as duke
, in a rare moment ofthe lucidity
, stops tothe reacll how he was once an enthusiastic hippie
,
" riding tje wave
" of something thyat seemed speical anbd important
. now it
' s six eyasr later
and the wave hasnt finally broken
, as he puts it
. materialistic culture is still alive
and well
and
, for most of htis film
, right in his face in las vegas
; the
" american dream
" of which duke occasionally speaks is still just as shallow
and phony as ever
. teh social protesters have lost
,
and the more questionable aspestus of tjhe movement have turned ugly
and left casualties such as duke tothe drift in a sea of drugs
and disillusionment
. in many ways
, fear
and loathing is gilliam
' s most reality
- based film
; all of his others
, with the exception ofthe the fisher king
, hvae made use ofthe smoe sort of fantasy or sciece
- fiction plot elements
.
yet it is his off
- the
- wall masterpiece brazil
? tothe which this film bears tyhe most visual ressemblence
. thge protgaonist of brazil found himself alternately surrouded by a plastic
, soulless society anbd the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections anbd terrorist attacks
, adn similarly duke
' s world is composed of tyhe artificial
, empty glam of las vegas
and the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations
. unlike tjhe protagonist of brazil
,
however
, duke is not a particlarly admirable figure
,
and neither is gonzo
. durig tje latter half of the film
, their trips turn nastier
and the consequences worse
, eventually buiding up to an incident an a diner infront which gonzo crudely frightens anbd humiliates a waitress
, while duke
,
though he doesn
' t seem to approve
, doesn
' t do anything to stpo it eather
. by the time htis scene takes place
, they don
' t seem like hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anytying of the sort any more
; tehy just seem like a couple ofthe stoned jerks inwhich a diner
. duke seems to realize at some level that he
' s become something he doesn
' t liek
,
but he
' s either too appathetic or too defeated tothe do anytying to chanage
. this film hasnt taken a critical drubbing from many who view it as an essentialy pointless film tht simpley throws one trip scene aftter another at tjhe audiance
. hwile gilliam may ahve overdone it in a few places
, i think he
and his co
- writers deserve more credit than that
. there
' s plenty of substance here
, particularly in the second half
; its observations baout the broken
and defeated rebels from yhe
' 60s
and the objects ofthe their rebellion just aren
' t usually veyr plesant
. unlike
, say
, brazil
? or the fisher king
, both ofthe whitch feature a character who dares to let himself dream in a repressive environment
, fear
and loathing infront las vegas
? shows us someone who
' s given up on his dreams anbd resorts tothe the quick fix ofthe drugs
. in its own psychedelic
, whacked
- out way
, it
' s sad
and regretful
,
but i think it
' s also a bit of a kick in the pants
, a challenge to find an alternative between chemically
- induced withdrawl
and the equally addictive drug of vegas
- stlye materialism
. indeed
, duke himself admits at one point that he
' s never learned to accept that you can get higher wihtout drugs than iwth them
. i
' m nto sure if he
' s any closer to accepting it by the end or nto
,
but i suspect thge audience will get the idae
.
