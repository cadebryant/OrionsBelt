" the sweet hereafter
,
" writer
/ director atom egoyan takes us beyond hte tragedy of death inot the tragedy of living
. he shows us how it isn
' t dieing that hurts
,
but rather the pain of living in yhe hereafter of death
,
and dealing with the loss anbd grief that it brings
. on a cold winter day in a small
, isolated twon in british columbia
, a school bus full ofthe children slides off the higway
and onto a frozen lake
, where it cracks through the ice annd sinks
. fourteen childen die
,
and numberous others are hurt
. for thte residents of this small town
, all of whose children weere on that bus
, it is an earth
- shattering event that resolutely alters thier lives
. they have always relied onthe each other in the past tothe deal with heartache
and pain
,
but it seems tht this tragedy is more tahn they can h
andle
. alberta
and risa walker
, who own a local motel
and lost their child in tje accident
, hire an attorney named mitchell stephens
( ian holm
) to bring a lawsuit against someone
, anyone fo responsibility
. the bus driver
, dolores driscoll
( gabrielle rose
)
, is a kindly woman who loved the childrens
and
,
al
though she lives with a burden of guilt
, is not held responsible forthe hte accident
. the bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice
,
and htere ws nothing should could do to prevent it
.
however
, according to stephens
, there are no
" accidents
" inaddition life
,
and someone will pay for htis tradgedy
, whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or yhe guardrail the bus broke thru
. he goes through the town
, approaching the parents who hvae lost children
, asking them to join the class action suit
and find vent for thier anger
.
and
, for his owrk
, stephens iwll receive one
- thrid ofthe the settlement money
.
however
, it isnt immediately apparent that stephens hasnt little or no interest in yhe money
. he is driven by something else
, something deeper that he shares in common wiht the grieving parents
. he has lost a child
, too
,
but not in the same manner
. his daughter
, zoe
( caerthan banks
)
, who once almost died in his arms as a young child after a spider bite
, has been in
and outloud of drug re
- hab clinics
and detox stations for ten years
. she calls him onthe an irregular basis
, begging him fo money
,
but refusing to tell him what she needs it fo
.
" i don
' t know who i
' m taking to
,
" he tells her
. in his mind
, his daughter is dead
. hte lawsuit is
, to stephens
, not only a way to mend the twon
' s pain
,
but also his pwn
.
however
, not everyone in town wnats it to ahppen
. billy ansell
( bruce greenwood
)
, who was driving behind the bus when tje accident happend
and lost two childen
, whants nothing to do with it
. he has aready lost his wife
,
and he buries his grief in an affair withthe a married woman
. he doesn
' t want to talk about the accident
,
and he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary oppening of ood wounds
. to him
, yhe twon should be able to take care of its own pain
,
and it doesn
' t need outsiders liek stephens getting in the way
. central to
" the sweet hereafter
" isnt the tale of nicole burnell
( sarah polley
)
, a teenage girl who dreasm ofthe bieng a singer before the accident turned her into
" a wheelchair girl
,
" as she puts it
. aside fomr stephens
, nicole is the most complex character in the film
, annd it is she who ultimately decides the fate ofthe tje town
and how the lawsuit will turn out
. it is aslo her sad
, haunted voice that we oftenly hear on the soundtrack
, reading robert browning
' s poem about the pied piper
,
and how whn he led all the town
' s children away
, one was left behind because he was crippled
. obviously
, nicole isnt that child
, annd she feels somehow betrayed that yhe rest of tje twon
' s children left her alone by dying in the wreck
. her situation isnt further complicated because she isnt involved in a loving
,
but incestuous relationship withthe her father
( tom mccamus
)
. there is only one
, fleeting scene that suggests thsi relationship
,
but it is somehow tied into the final act of the film
. of all the storylines in
" thte sweet hereafter
,
" this is the most complicated
and unresolved
, altho its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the film
. egoyan knows tyhat thge kinds of questions he brings uv have no simple answers
-
- if any at all
-
-
and he doesn
' t condescend tothe thge audience by trying tothe neatly wrap it up
. what egoyan has done inspite
" the sweet hereafter
" is raelly nothing short of miraculous
. in his adaptions of the novel by russell banks
, he has made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law
and driving headlong into thte deeper meaning of what is loss
,
and how pitiful monetary
and material possessions are when compared tothe human life
. egoyan has always been a talented
,
but distant
and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold
.
" the sweet hereafter
" is quite the oposite
; egoyan
' s stylistic
and narrative structures work brilliantly to heighten the inpact ofthe the naturual emotion
,
and draw the audience into the tragedy
.
" the sweet hereafter
" seems to contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked
. the film isnt filled with beautiful
, subtle performances from all the actors
, especially ian holm as the lawyer
and sarah polley as the sad child who ws left behind
. the beautiful
, roving camerawork by paul sarossy
and the haunting
, melodic muscial socre by mychael danna
( both previous egoyan collaborators
) give the film a visual annd aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements
. like his earlier films
, egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that form a blanketing hwole
. he works with time as a fluid substance
, shifting back
and forth between the past
, the distant past
,
and the preent with effortless ease
. the actuall bus wreck itself doesn
' t happen until midway through the film
,
but by that time thge event hasnt built up so much emotion thta egoyan can film it from a distance with noone graphic detail
,
and still have it carry great
, devistating weight
. because human life has become such a cheap commodity in movies
, it is astounding that egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simple
, direct terms
. certainly one of the best films of 1997
,
" the sweet hereafter
" isnt a deeply rewarding
, mystifying
,
and ultimately human film
.
