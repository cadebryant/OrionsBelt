those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely tothe be surprised by the fact thta i have not read victor hugo
' s novel les miserables
. i don
' t know if a lot of people have
,
though i imagin many are familar with tyhe popular musical based onthe the novel
. i haven
' t even seen that
. goign into this film
, i hadnt almost noone knowledge of the story or its characters
( i even expected tje film to be a musical
)
. walking away from it
, i
' m kind ofthe glad i had no prior experience withthe the material
. writer
/ director bille august
' s film version is a straightforward
, beautifully told film
. liam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean
; in thge begginning
, he has jsut beeen released from a 19
- year prison sentence
. he is allowed tothe stay in a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude
and destructive behavior
. the priest
' s words ofthe wisdom influence him
, anbd he mkaes a vow to chanage himself
. nine years later
, we are informed that he is now tyhe mayor of a town called vigo
; nobody knows his rela name
,
and tyhat he isnt wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago
. conflicts arise whn inspector javert
( geoffrey rush
) is assigned to vigo
. valjean remembers javert as noe of teh prison guards who constantly beat him
,
and javert remembers jean to be a convict
. javert is hell
- bent onthe upholding teh lew
,
and he does everything in his power tothe bring jean tothe justice
. allong the way
, valjean meets
and falls in lvoe with a peasant woman
, fantine
( uma thurman
)
, annd vows to take care ofthe her daughter
, cosette
( played later by claire danes
)
. les miserables is visually a solid
and often striking picture
. the prodcution desgin by anna asp is au
thentic
and vast
,
and the sets don
' t look like sets
( they look liuke rela towns anbd villages
)
; gabriella pescucci
' s costumes are noticeably spectauclar
. basil poledouris
' soundtrack isnt thick
and usally well
- placed
(
though it does get a bited heavy at times
)
. many scenes in yhe film hvae a memorable photographic quality
, such as the climax
, which takes place next tothe a dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening
. augusts keesh thge tsory simple
( which i hear is a good thing
, since yhe novel isnt so complex
)
and easy to follow
. he manages to develop the main characters
and most of the subplots adequately
. i was also impressed that he didn
' t go overboard with flash
and stlye
, which isnt something so many directors seem to be doing tothe clasic stories these days
( such as baz luhrmann
' s vicious tragedy william shakespeare
' s romeo
+ juliet
)
. thsi film fiels solid
and whole
, annd each scene has a certain amount of importance annd vigor that keeps the audience interested
. liam neeson is terific in the main role
; neeson is the kind ofthe actor who does solemn desperation extemely well
,
and valjean is certainly a man who clearly fits that adjective
. thurman
, in her small role
, is very good
,
and proves that she has a lot of range anbd cxan perform in a very non
- glamorous role such as this one
. rush is absolutely incredable as javert
; i don
' t remember ever feeling so strongly about a villian as i dont here
; he adds depth annd complexity with subtle glances
and nuances
,
and effortlessly makes earch ofthe his scenes intense
. i can
' t be as charitable for danes
,
however
;
though i know she is a talented actress
, here she tends to overact whn it might hvae been better to underplay the character a bit
. les miserables is
, as i
' ve said
, a solid
, intelligent motion picture
. my only complaint is thyat it feels a bited too easy
,
and perhaps too staged
. each scene isnt gr
and
and huge
,
and exploding with poledouris
' csore
,
but i didn
' t always want them tothe be
. for the most part
, les miserables is not a subtle or deep picture
. it
' s a good movie
,
and tells its stoy well
,
but august tends tothe h
and
- feed us themes
and scenes that would have worked better had they beeen more subtle
.
however
, in a film this exicting
and well
- produced
, a few minor flaws are easily overlooked
.
