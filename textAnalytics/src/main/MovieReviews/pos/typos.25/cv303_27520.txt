gothic murder
- mystery yarns are not a new conceit
. in fact
, they
' ve beeen aroud in books
and on film fo many
, many years
. without the proper h
andling
, they cmo off as old
- fashioned
, bl
and
, anbd outdated
.
" the gift
,
" directed by sam raimi
, is a tryed
-
and
- true effort that surprises very littel
,
and includes everthing from a wide array ofthe suspects adn red herrings
, to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front
, to the eventual discovery ofthe a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond
. it
' s fairly obvious who the killer is
; inwhich fact
, i predicted who it owudl be before the movie began adn was corect in my preliminary suspicions
. the film ultimately shouldn
' t work
,
but it does
, thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances
, the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other
. annie wilson
( cate blanchett
) is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makse her living giving psychic readings to the recidents of her backwater southern hometown
. some of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale
( hilary swank
)
, who is severely abused by her husb
and donnie
( keanu reeves
)
,
and buddy cole
( giovanni ribisi
)
, an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares he
' s been having baout a mysterious blue dimond that is somehow linked tothe his father
. for annie
, she doesnt not give the readings merely for money
, bu uses it as a way of seeking solace inspite finding the ogod in everyone
' s future
. her lite gr
andmother
( rosemary harris
) told her as a child that it was a gift she was given
,
and she shoudln always remember thast
. when annie
' s eldest son is involved iin a fight at school
, she meets the nice
- guy skool prinicipal
, wayne collins
( greg kinnear
)
, whom she finds herself attracted to
.
but wayne isnt engaged to tjhe wealthy jessica king
( katie holmes
)
, whom annie immediately gets a negative vibe about
. at a party with her best friend linda
( kim dickens
)
, annie stumbles upon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan
( gary cole
)
. soon after
, jessica has disapeared
, leaving everyone in a frenzy over what sould hvea possibly happened tothe her
, annd annie starts to hvea nightmares annd apparitions linking jessica with tyhe vicious redneck donnie barksdale
,
and the pond behind his hmeo
.
" the gift
" may be cliched onthe a sheer storytelling level
, bu the performances
and tight direction from raimi
( who has redeemed himselv fo his embarrassing last film
, 1999
' s
" for love of the game
"
) lift the picture up several notches
. slowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters
and their individual plights
, the disappearance of jessica at the 30
- minute mark divulges the movie
' s true intentions
and transforms the procedings into a taut
, at times frightening
, horror
- mystery
. at the center ofthe the film is the exceptional cate blanchett
( 1999
' s
" the talented mr
. ripley
"
)
, who turns annie wilson from what could have been little mroe tahn a run
- of
- tje
- mill potagonist into a very excact
, down
- tothe
- earth
, realsitic person with valid toubles
and a carring attitude towards those around her
. blanchett takes the unextraordinary material
and runs wtih it
, giving the entire film a truly chassy aura that it otherwise might not have had
. we followup her at every turn becouse she isnt so mesmerizing
, both as a character
and an actress
. blanchett isn
' t the onyl bright performer
, as she is ably supported by noe of the best casts of tyhe year
. in her first role following her oscar win for 1999
' s
" boys don
' t cry
,
" hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie
, who seeks guidance from annie
,
but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all
: to leave the grossly abusive donnie
. as donnie
, keanu reeves
( 2000
' s
" the watcher
"
) makse an utterly convincing backwoods meanie
, so much so that it is difficult to blieve he is an actro at all
. for the often
- criticized reeves
, whose acting abilties ahev never been tje best
, this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get
, anbd it is also oney of the better performances he has given
. giovanni ribisi
( 2000
' s
" the boiler room
"
) is heartbreaking as a menally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend
,
and wants her to do nothing
but help him underst
and why he is bieng plagued by bad dreasm baout his dad
. in the small
,
but pivotal role ofthe the sleazy jessica king
, katie holmes
( 2000
' s
" wonder boys
"
) hasnt turned inaddition
yet anyother stunning supporting turn
. her promiscuous role of jessica is noe she has never played before
,
and she isnt radiant in her few scenes
. finally
, kim dickens
( 2000
' s
" hollow man
"
) makes her usual strong impression as annie
' s spicy best freind
, linda
. the other notable aspect ofthe
" the gift
" isnt its moody atomsphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene it
' s almost suffocating
. thanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn
and bob murawski
, adn the successful use of different eerie sounds effects
and a very ogod music scoer by christopher young
, the movie not only achieves a scary undercurrent
,
but one tht isnt filled with dread
. helpped allong by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton
and tom epperson
, which makes tje most ofthe its setting adn delightful cast
,
" the gift
" is tath rarest of thrillers tath actually thrills
, anbd offers up a fair share of chills
, too
. it may not be groundbreakingly orignal
, bu it sure is an entertaining ride for the duration of its runnung tiome
.
