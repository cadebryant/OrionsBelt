. this film is not rated
. the central themes of
" sick
: the life
and death of bob flanagan
, supermasochist
" are pain
and love
, annd its subsequent effect on a person
' s life
. its protagonist
, bob flanagan
, who died at thte age of 52
, suffered from cystic fibrosis
, a mortal desease which debilitates thte lungs by saturating them with thick coats of mucus
, preventing him fomr normal breathing
. the movie is baout much more than recouperating
( or attempting to
) from this desease
. an audacious
, fabulously triumphant docudrama
,
" sick
" chronicles the life ofthe flanagan annd his vicious
, unthinkable acts of sadomasochism conducted with his mistress of 15 years
, sheree rose
, who amazingly provided much of the footage forthe the film
. flanagan
' s idelogy crosses the realms ofthe rebelliousness adn becomes trancendental
, similar tothe terry zwigoff
' s brilliant 1994
" crumb
"
, which aslo explored the dysfunction ofthe an artist by painting not a sympathetic portait
,
but a realistic one
. both crumb
and flanagan revelled in their defects
.
but flanagan was nto onyl a man content on enduring the pain via lungs
, he inflicted acts of pain onthe himselv at a very young age
, courageously defying god
( he was an irish catholic
)
and turning his body inot a work of art
, which he unraveled inspite museums
and lectures
. behold these works of physical art
. among them is a metal ball inserted inside his anus
,
and
,
-
- thte most disturbing scene of the decade
-
-
, nailing his penis to a board
. flanagan was a man of gerat intelligence
, wit annd humer
, as well as adopting a sense of c
andidness scarcely seen infact modern filmmaking
. not only doed he aproach his disease with humor
, peforming burlesque acts iin front of an audeince
, he was also revitalized by his approachment
. most wih cystic fibrosis do not make it past their earlier twenties
( there
' s also a subplot involving a female devotee who knew death was awaiting her
.
) bu the most outst
anding thign about
" sick
" is flanagan
' s relatiopnship with sheree
. brimming with honesty
, sensual stimulation
and unapologetically sad moments ofthe pain
, their poweful bond lifts
" sick
" into a rare cinematic high
, where we forget we are in an autotorium
and become a part of these people
. the last scene
, where we see the hero murmuring thge last words to his wief in a hospital bed
, as he struggles forthe his lastest moments of life
, is raw
, tender
, hideous
. it goes a step beyond cinematic intimacy
.
