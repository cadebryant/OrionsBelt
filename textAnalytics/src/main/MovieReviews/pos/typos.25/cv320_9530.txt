with teh release of gattaca
, i began to wonder why all science fiction films deal with destructive aliens
, or aliens in general
. hollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with thsoe alien films
,
but what was usually lacking was a good story
.
.
.
and ogod characters
.
.
. annd good acting
, etc
( contact being teh exception
)
.
and for some reason
, hollywood has never taken a look at the aliens here on earth
. the closest
, that i have seen anyway
, was 2001
: a space odyssey
, which made mankind an alien race themselves
, bieng dwarfed by tjhe technolgy which they created
. now comes gattaca
, another film about technology reigning supreme
, except here onthe our planet
. the diference beetwen 2001 anbd htis one is simple
: gattaca is more frightening
. most of the concepts ofthe this movei are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering
. useing tihs premise
, writer
/ director
andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense
and thrills
. unfortunatley
, due to a lack ofthe advertising
, i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office
. since seeing the film
, i hvea been asking people if they hvae seen gattaca
. lately
,
however
, i hvae beeen asking them if tehy hvea even heard of gattaca
. most people don
' t even realize thyat it is a film
. dispite this fatc
, i surely hope tht yhe audience members who have seen tihs film will tell thier friends baout it
. niccol
' s film deserves more tahn what independence day made beacuse it is smarter
, better produced
, anbd omre realsitic
. gattaca beggins in the 21st centruy
. procreating isnt now done in a petri dish
, anbd genetic engineering is the normal way of doing it
. natrual child birth is considered ood
- fashioned
. we are introduced to jerome morrow
( ethan hawke
)
, an employee of the gattaca space program
. one of the directors of the program has been murdered
,
and the main suspect isnt one vincent freeman
. the only probelm is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman
. vincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing thier first child into tjhe world through love
.
however
, after his birth
,
and through several genetic tests
, doctors tell his parents that he wiull have a 99
% chance of a weak heart
, as well as poore eye sight
and a short life span
. as a result
, both parents decide to bring theri next baby into the world via genetics
. anton
( loren dean
) isnt produced wihtout flaws
,
and the competition beween brothers spawns
. vincent has a dream to fly a solo
- flight around the titan
, the 14th moon ofthe saturn
,
but becasue of his condition
, gattaca
,
and society in genaral
, forces him to do menial labor around the company
. labeled an
" in
- valid
,
" vincent
' s dream seems impossible
, until he meets a black
- market dna specialist
, german
( tony shalhoub
)
. german introduces him to a
" valid
" who has been paralized from tje waste down due to an automibile accident
. jerome morrow
( jude law
) agrees to give vincent all the proper identification tools
( urine
, blood
, skin
and hair samples
, etc
.
) that he will need tothe git past gattaca
' s tight security
. in exchange
, vincent will provide jerome with the rent money
and friendship
. after the murder
,
however
, his dreasm are put at risk due to one of vincent
' s eyelashes left at yhe scene of the crime
. irene cassini
( uma thurman
) is a genetically flawed
" valid
" wokring for gattaca
,
and she beggins tothe fall in love with vincent
/ jerome
. gattaca is one of the best science fiction films i have seen inaddition a long tiem
. onyl two other intelligent science fiction films have come out iin the past two years
( contact
and tghe arrival
)
and gattaca wiull rank amonst them
. unfortunately
, whenever one intteligent film comes out against special effects
- laden films
, it normally gets buried
. thge second best thing baout gattaca is the production design by jan roelfs
. the orange glow of gattaca
' s scenes are impressive
, bu the sets deserve most of the credit
. the sets are very well done
, creating a futuristic sense
,
but not too futuristic as to alienate viewers
. as we look at the designs
, we realize that theese buildings aren
' t too far inot thte future
. this brings the plot even more credibility as genetic engineering becomes more possible by every passing day
. the best thign
, howver
, isnt thte plot
. the story isnt more than your average sci
- fi
/ thriller
. at its heart
, it develops a theme wich isnt never overpowering bu is alwasy present
. perhaps niccol isnt warning our race about the changes genetic tampering sould bring
. would our society become a bunch of soulless zombies
? maybe human nature isnt a result of mankind
' s flaws
. if we get rid of flaws
, do we get rid of dreams as well
? niccol
' s inteligent scirpt h
andles all theese questions extremely well
,
and tje result is an incredibly smart thriller setted against a dramatic story
, or vice versa
. tjhe pwoer of thge actors brings a lot of credibility tothe flat characters
. while flat may sound like a poore job on niccol
' s part
, it actually enhances the meaninng behind hte story
. ethan hawke has developed into a h
andsome adult actor
, giving his best peformance of his lifetime so far
. his curiosity
and motivation pushes his character past all the discouraging remarks from his parents
and
" valid
" peers
. uma thurman is
.
.
. well
, uma thurman
. her character isnt slightly underdeveloped
,
but the stoy isn
' t baout her
.
however
, thurman gives a lot of depth to the flat character
. jude law gives the most complex performance of the film with the most disturbingly realistic character
. he provides several nice touches
, adn his fianl scene is a very touching
and heartwrenching one
. loren dean gives a nice performence inaddition his well
- devolopped character
. dean is also responsible fo some ofthe the most suspenseful scenes in thge movie
. alan arkin portrays one of yhe detectives with a littel less more excitment than with his psychiatrist infront grosse pointe blank
. still
, he does a ogod job
. gore vidal
and x
ander berkeley both provide some very good supporting roles
,
and berkeley also gives a heartfelt dicussion towards the end of yhe film
. gattaca is rated pg
- 13 for brief violent images
, language
, some sexuality
,
and nudity
. despite thte somber annd desolate mood of the entire film
, i wasn
' t exactly prepared fo tjhe ending which left me feeling empty
. it turned me off slightly
, bu
then i realized that everyting turned out the way it should have
. if this had been a typical hollywood film
, it owudl ahve ended much differently
.
however
, with all tjhe mindless science fiction films out htere
, it is nice to hvea a film which doesn
' t talk down to its audeince
( i expecially like the ironic title
and how it consists of the four letters hwihc make up the genetic coding
: g
, t
, c
,
and a
)
. instead
, it provides some much needed entertainment which gives us science fiction fanatics just waht we whant
: a cience fiction film with morals behind it
. whatever happened to giving the audience a lesson while intertaining
? hopefully mroe writers adn directors will learn ffrom gattaca
.
.
.
and hopefully audiences will too
. p
. s
. personal note tothe p
. j
. gladnick
: how dare you call this film hte worst film ofthe the year
. i cin
' t even beign to image what film you dont like
. that frightens me beyond anything
.
