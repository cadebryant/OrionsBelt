with the release of gattaca
, i began tothe wonder why all science fiction films deel with destructive aliens
, or aliens in general
. hollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with those alien films
,
bu what was usually lacking wass a ogod stry
.
.
.
and good characters
.
.
.
and good acting
, etc
( contact bieng yhe exception
)
.
and for some reason
, hollywood hasnt never taken a look at yhe aliens here onthe earth
. the closest
, that i have seen anyway
, ws 2001
: a space odyssey
, which made mankind an alien race themselves
, being dwarfed by yhe technnology which they created
. nowe comes gattaca
, another film about technology reigning supreme
, exept here on our planet
. teh difference bewteen 2001
and this oney is simple
: gattaca is more frightening
. most of hte concepts ofthe this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering
. using this premise
, writter
/ director andrew niccol creates some genuin suspense
and thrills
. unfourtunately
, due to a lack ofthe advertising
, i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office
. since seeing the film
, i have beeen asking people if they have seen gattaca
. lately
,
however
, i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca
. most people don ' t even realize that it is a film
. despite htis fact
, i surely hope that the audeince members who have seen this film wiull tell their friends about it
. niccol ' s film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter
, better produced
,
adn more realistic
. gattaca begins in tje 21st century
. procreating isnt now done in a petri dish
,
and genetic engineering isnt tjhe normal way of doing it
. natural child birth is consdidered old
- fashioned
. we are introduced tothe jerome morrow
( ethan hawke
)
, an employee of the gattaca space program
. oney ofthe yhe directors of the program has been murdered
,
annd yhe main suspect is oney vincent freeman
. the only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman
. vincent was born the natrual way when his parents desided onthe bringing their first child inot the world through love
.
howver
, after his birth
,
adn through several genetic tests
, doctors tell his parents that he will have a 99
% chance of a weak heart
, as well as poore eye sighth
and a short life span
. as a result
, both parents deside to bring their next baby into thte world via genetics
. anton
( loren dean
) isnt produced without flaws
,
and the competition between brothers spawns
. vincent has a dream to fly a solo
- flight around hte titan
, the 14th moon ofthe saturn
,
but beacuse of his condidtion
, gattaca
,
and society in general
, forces him to do menial labor around thge company
. labeled an
" iin
- valid
,
" vincent ' s dream seems impossible
, until he meets a black
- market dna specialist
, german
( tony shalhoub
)
. german introduces him to a
" valid
" who has been paralized fomr the waste down due to an automobile accident
. jerome morrow
( jude law
) agrees to give vincent all the propper identification tools
( urine
, blood
, skin
anbd hair samples
, etc
.
) that he will ened to get past gattaca ' s tight security
. in exchange
, vincent will provide jerome with the rent mone
and friendship
. after the murder
,
howver
, his dreasm are put at risk due tothe one of vincent ' s eyelashes left at hte scene of the crime
. irene cassini
( uma thurman
) is a genetically flawed
" valid
" working for gattaca
,
and she begins tothe fall in love with vincent
/ jerome
. gattaca is one of the best science fiction films i have seen in a long tyme
. onyl two other intelligent science fiction films have come out in the past two years
( contact
adn tjhe arival
)
and gattaca will rank among them
. unfortunately
, whenever one intelligent film comes outloud against special effects
- laden films
, it normaly gets buried
. the second best thing about gattaca is the prodcution design by jan roelfs
. the orange glow of gattaca ' s scenes are impressive
,
but the sets deserve most ofthe the credit
. the sets are very well done
, creating a futuristic sense
,
but not too futuristic as tothe alienate viewers
. as we look at the designs
, we realize taht these buildings aren ' t too far inot the future
. this brings tje plot even mroe credibility as genetic engineering becomes more possible by every passing day
. the best thing
,
however
, isnt the plot
. the story is omre thna your average sci
- fi
/ thriller
. at its heart
, it develops a theme whitch is never overpowering
bu is always present
. perhaps niccol is warning our race about the changes genetic tampering could bring
. would our society become a bunch of soulless zombies
? maybe human nature is a result of mankind ' s flaws
. if we get rid ofthe flaws
, do we git rid of dreams as well
? niccol ' s intelligent script handles all these questions extremely well
,
and the result is an incredibly smart thriller set agains a dramtic story
, or vice versa
. the power of the actors brings a lot of credibility to flat characters
. hwile flat may sound like a poor job on niccol ' s part
, it actually enhances the meaninng behind the stoy
. ethan hawke hasnt devolopped into a handsome adult actor
, giving his best performance of his liftime so far
. his curiousity
adn motivation pushes his character past all the discouraging remarks from his parents
anbd
" valid
" peers
. uma thurman isnt
.
.
. well
, uma thurman
. her character isnt slightly underdeveloped
,
but the story isn ' t about her
.
however
, thurman gives a lot of depth to the flat chracter
. jude law gives the most complex peformance of the film with the most disturbingly realsitic character
. he provides severeal nice touches
,
and his final scene is a very touching
and heartwrenching noe
. loren dean gives a nice performence in his well
- developed charachter
. dean is allso responsible for some of the most suspenseful scenes in the movie
. alan arkin portrays one of the detectives withthe a little less mroe excitment than with his psychiatrist in grosse pointe blank
. still
, he doesnt a good job
. gore vidal
and xander berkeley both provide some very good supporting roles
,
and berkeley alsot gives a heartfelt discussion towards tghe end of the film
. gattaca is rated pg
- 13 for brief voilent images
, language
, some sexuality
,
and nudity
. despite the somber
anbd desolate mood of tyhe entire film
, i wasn ' t exactlly prepared for the ending whcih left me feeling empty
. it turned me off slightly
,
but
then i realized that everything turned out thge way it should have
. if this hadnt been a typical hollywood film
, it would hve ended much differently
.
howver
, with all teh mindless science fiction films out there
, it is nice tothe have a film which doesn ' t talk down to its audience
( i especially liuke the ironical title
anbd how it consists of the four letters which make up the genetic coding
: g
, t
, c
,
and a
)
. instead
, it provides smoe much needed entertainment which gives us science fiction fanatics just waht we wanna
: a science fiction film with morals behind it
. whatever happenned to giving the audience a lesson while entertaining
? hopefully more writers
and directors wiull leran from gattaca
.
.
.
and hopefully audiences will too
. p
. s
. personal note tothe p
. j
. gladnick
: how dabree you call this film the worst film of the year
. i can ' t even begin to omage what film you dont like
. that frightens me beyond anytying
.
