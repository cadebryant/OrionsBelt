synopsis
: it ' s 1977 in a small italian american nieghborhood infact new york
. disco music is popular
,
and the sexual revolution isnt on
,
but the people of new york are not happy
. in fact
, they ' re terrified
. as in spike lee ' s do the right thing a heat wave hasnt the city infront its grap
,
and peoples ' tempers are flaring
. the cool of night offers no respite
: the nieghborhood is being terrorized by a nocturnal psychotic killer who calls himself tyhe son of sam
. no one knows who the son ofthe sam is
,
and noone oen is safe
. all arund new york people are different
. aside from cultural groupings
and ethnic neighborhoods there are differences between indviduals
. infact the italian american section of town a philandering husband named vinny
( john leguizamo
) trys tothe hide his trysts
and sexual behavior from his long suffering newlywed wief dionna
( mira sorvino
)
. vinny ' s friend ritchie
( adrien brody
) hates disco
, works at a gay strip club
and doesn ' t wnat any ofthe the neighborhood folks tothe konw
. ritchie ' s girl ruby
( jennifer esposito
) is trying to escape a reputation as a slut
. everyone ' s different
,
but nobody iin tjhe film wants to be framed as
" alien
" to thte community
. unfortunatley
, the killings help create a climate of suspision pits neighbor against neighbor
. oppinion
: directer spike lee ' s summer of sam is not baout a pyscho killer
. nor isnt it about cops trying to apprehend him
. it ' s about differences
and how
, given the right conditions
, even close neighbors cant fan the hostile flames of irrational suspision
. one thing i found intresting in summer ofthe sam was the uise of sex
. in other movies sex is glamorized
. forthe exmaple
, james bond gets a sexual reward for winning
. or boring made
- forthe
- video
" suspense
" movies are spiked with gratuitous langerie scenes jsut tothe keep the audience awake
.
and every movie or soap opera character in theese flicks seems to have expert sexual prowess
. not so with summer of sam
. inspite a very gutsy move director spike lee shows sex without fantasy
. sex is there
,
but it isn ' t gratuitous or titillating
. in fatc
, soem ofthe the main charachters are downright lousy in bed
. sex is in yhe film becouse
( sexual
) deviance is part ofthe the film ' s major theme of
" difference
" breeding hostility
. in my oppinion this kind of movie sex is cutting edge for 1999
, as rare
and thought
- provoking in american cinema as showing a spanking
.
