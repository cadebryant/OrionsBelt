,
but the peopel ofthe new york are not happy
. inwhich fact
, they
' re terrified
. as inaddition spike lee
' s do the right thing a heat wave has the city in its grip
,
and poeoples
' tempers are flaring
. the kool of inght offers no respite
: the neighborhood is bieng terrorized by a nocturnal psychotic killer who calls hismelf the son ofthe sam
. no one knows who tje son of sam is
,
and no one is safe
. all around new york peple are different

) is trying tothe excape a reputation as a slut
. everyone
' s different
,
but nobody inaddition the film whants to be framed as
" alien
" to the community
. unfortunately
, the killings help create a climate of suspicion pits neighbor aginst neighbor
. oppinion
: director spike lee
' s summer ofthe sam is not about a psycho killer
. nor is it about cops trying to apprehend him
. it
' s about differences
and how
, given the right condidtions
, even close neighbors cin fan the hostile flames of irrational suspision
. one hting i found intresting in summer ofthe sam was thte use of sex
. in other movies sex is glamorized
. fo exmaple
, james bond gets a sexual reward for winning
. or boring made
- forthe
- video
" suspense
" movies are spiked with gratuitous lingerie scenes just to keep the audience awake
.
and every movei or soap opera character in these flicks seems to have expert sexual prowess
. not so with summer of sam
. in a vyer gutsy move director spike lee shows sex without fantasy
. sex isnt htere
,
but it isn
' t gratuitous or titillating
. infact fact
, some ofthe tje main characters are downright lousy in bed
. sex isnt in thge film becouse
( sexual
) deviance is part ofthe the film
' s major theme of
" difference
" breeding hostility
. in my opinion this kind of movei sex is cutting edge for 1999
, as rare
and
thought
- provoking in american cinema as showing a spanking
.
