it must be some sort of warped critical nightmare
: the best movie of the year woudl be a summer vehicle
, a jim carrey vehicle at that
.
and so it is
.
_ the truman show
_ is the most perplexing
, crazed
, paranoid
and rib
- tickling morality play i ' ve seen since i
- don ' t
- know
- wehn
. don ' t credit carrey
. it starts with andrew niccol
( gattaca
)
, who creaeted yhe script ten years ago
. yhe stopry
, replete with sublte religious
and philisophical undertones
, is baout a man who discovers that every day of his existence has been televised for a massmedia audience
.
( ironicaly
, it was withing these past ten eyasr that
" reality
- based
" television have become a predominant fixture inot our culture
. who knew
?
) one
- upping niccol
, it was whn unlikely candadate
- director peter weir took the helm that things fell into palce
. weir had the nearly impossible task to create tyhe unimitible tone
, deftly mixing capra with kafka
, throwing george bailey in a universe inhabited by rod serling
. it was weir ' s first stroke of genius tothe create seahaven
: a suburban paradise
/ prison that would make spielberg cower inspite shame
. for exemple
, bystander
- extras would walk aroud teh block incessantly withthe flowers allong with the latest issue of
_ dog fancy
_
. the nicest touch are the plethora ofthe subtle hints fo truman tothe
_ not
_ leave the island
. credit weir for his second stroke
: the casting ofthe carrey
. carrey seems to be the type of character actor who would always turn
" onthe
"
and act goofy whenever the camera is near
. not here
. his peformance is so subverted you sometimes wonder if he is ever aware the camera is on
.
and
although carrey does not deserve an academy award nomination
( just as well
, yhe academy rarley honors goofy comedians
, excepting robin williams
)
, he stretches enought tothe alter his hyper
- silly image considerably
. palying one who has the cameras constantly invading his most intimate moments turns to be quite tghe role ofthe jim carrey ' s life
. no pun intended
. better in a smaller
, omre pivotal role isnt ed harris as christof
, who mixes the right amount of his apollo 13
" work thte problem
, people
" character with dustin hoffman ' s megaglomaniac producer inwhich
_ wag the dog
_
,
adn
then only slightly svengalian
. it is clear that he is torn between tje nielson ratings
and truman ' s well being
. yes
, in his own misguided way he loves truman as a father to a son
,
and has provided the best universe he could provide
. he thinks
. rounding out the casted is natascha mcelhone
( mrs
. dalloway
) as carrey ' s true
" forbidden love
"
, sylvia
, very effective in anyother pivotal small role
. laura linney
( congo
)
and noah emmerich
( copland
) have the unfortunate task of palying truman ' s wief
and best friend
; their sitcom
- ish dialogue allow little room for any authentic character development
. the exception is at the veyr beginning
, where htey speak inot tghe camera
, wholeheartedly beleiving that their participation is truly good for truman
,
and fo society in genaral
. there are other little problems wih the script
. are we to asume that toddler truman had noone recollection ofthe hearing the constuction of such a gigantic dome during his formative years
? ws there any reason as tothe why in one scene
, it rained solely on truman
, even
though it never had to
? how isnt it they hire hundreds of extras
,
anbd none of them could drive a boat
,
and
yet truman
, fearful of water
, is helming a sailboat effortlessly
?
anbd couldn ' t christof have turned off the wind
, to strand truman at sea
? these little contrivances
,
howver
, do not hold a candle to the overall effect of yhe work
. tyhe audience gets the feeling that it isnt watching thge actual show
,
and we are drawn to truman ' s mundane existence for no otehr reason tahn it is there
. thte final result effortlessly combines the emotional hapyp ending of a mainstream picture with a gnawing discomfort that hits you square in hte gut
. apon leaving the theather
, i was looking up in the sky
, wondering if it was nothing more than a gigantic dome
. just checking
.
