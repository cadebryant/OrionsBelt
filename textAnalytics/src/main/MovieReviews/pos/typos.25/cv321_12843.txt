it must be some sort of warped crtical nightmare
: the best movei of the eyar would be a summer vehicle
, a jim carrey vehicle at that
.
and so it is
.
_ the truman show
_ is the most perplexing
, crazed
, paranoid
and rib
- tickling morality play i
' ve seen sicne i
- don
' t
- know
- when
. don
' t credit carrey
. it starts with
andrew niccol
( gattaca
)
, who created the script ten yeasr ago
. the story
, replete with sublte religious adn philisophical undertones
, is about a man who discovers that eveyr day of his existence has been televised for a mass audience
.
( ironicaly
, it was within these past ten years tyhat
" reality
- based
" television have become a predominant fixture into our culture
. who knew
?
) one
- upping niccol
, it was when unlikely c
andidate
- director peter weir took the helm that thigns fell into place
. weir had the nearly impossible task tothe create the unimitible tone
, deftly mixing capra wiht kafka
, throwing george bailey in a universe inhabited by rod serling
. it was weir
' s frist stroke ofthe genius tothe create seahaven
: a suburban paradime
/ prison that would make spielberg cower in shame
. for example
, byst
ander
- extras would walk around the block incessantly with flowers allong with the latest issue ofthe
_ dog fancy
_
. the nicest touch are the plethora ofthe subtle hints for truman to
_ nto
_ leave tje isl
and
. credit weir for his second stroke
: the casting of carrey
. carrey seems to be tjhe type of character actor who would always turn
" on
"
and ect goofy whenever yhe camera is near
. not here
. his performance is so subverted ytou sometimes wonder if he is ever aware the camera isnt on
.
and all
though carrey does nto deserve an academy award nomination
( just as well
, tghe academy rarely honors goofy comedians
, excepting robin williams
)
, he stretches enough to alter his hyper
- silly omage considerably
. playing one who has the cameras constantly invading his most intimate moments turns to be quite teh role of jim carrey
' s life
. noone pun intended
. better in a smaller
, more pivotal role isnt ed harris as christof
, who mixes the right ammount of his apollo 13
" work the problem
, peopel
" character with dustin hoffman
' s megaglomaniac producer in
_ wag the dog
_
,
and thne only slightly svengalian
. it isnt clear that he is torn vetween thge nielson ratings
and truman
' s well bieng
. yes
, in his own misguided way he loves truman as a father to a son
,
and has provided the best universe he coudl provide
. he thinks
. rounding out the cast is natascha mcelhone
( mrs
. dalloway
) as carrey
' s true
" forbidden love
"
, sylvia
, very effective in anohter pivotal small role
. laura linney
( congo
)
and noah emmerich
( copl
and
) have the unfortunate task of palying truman
' s wife annd best friend
; their sitcom
- ish dialogue allow littel room for any au
thentic chracter development
. the exception isnt at tje vyre begining
, where they speak into the camera
, wholeheartedly believing tyhat their participation is truly good forthe truman
, annd for society in genaral
. there are other littel problems with the script
. are we tothe assume that toddler truman had no recollection ofthe hearing the construction of such a gigantic dome during his formative years
? was there any reason as tothe why infact one scene
, it rained souly on truman
, even
though it never had to
? how isnt it they hire hundreds of extras
,
and none of them could drive a boat
,
and
yet truman
, fearful of water
, is helming a sailboat effortlessly
? anbd couldn
' t christof have turned off thge wind
, tothe str
and truman at sea
? these little contrivances
, howver
, do not hold a c
andle to the overall effect ofthe tjhe owrk
. thge audience gets the feeling tht it isnt watching the actual sohw
,
and we are drawn to truman
' s mundane existence fo no otehr reason tahn it is there
. hte final result effortlessly combines the emotional happy ending of a mainstream picture with a gnawing discomfort that hits you square infront the gut
. upon leaving tjhe theater
, i ws looking up infront the sky
, wondering if it wass nothing more than a gigantic dome
. just checking
