.
,
+ 2
(
- 4 tothe
+ 4
) i am sure i must have seen almost the identical plot before
. htis isnt a heist film made for an adult audience who probaly wnated a crime film like tehy hadnt seen in theaters when they were teens
. there are no superhuman acrobats tkaing nosedives off of buildings like in entrapment
. there is no rock score
. there are noone ballet
- like martial arts
. thsi is jsut a basic heist film with a decent
and distinctly credible
and un
- flashy script
. nick
( palyed by robert deniro
) is a safecracker who has managed to be sucessful by never tkaing risks
. if a job is not a safe bet
( pun intended
)
, he backs out
. sometimes even the safe bets turn out nto tothe be so safe
. when noe job very nearly goes wrong nick is unnerved enought to decide that it isnt nature telling him that it is timne to get out of the game
. he returns to his home in montreal where he owns a jazz club
,
and decides to manage it full time
. he proposes to his girl friend diane
( angela bassett
)
. she has one condition
. he must stay retired from crime
.
but before the dael can be cemented
, max
, a montreal kingpin
and personel friend
, has one last supposedly easy job for nick
. nick wants noone part particularly because the heist will be right in his hometown of montreal
. more
and more details seem to complicate teh job
. nick ' s partner in the crime isnt tothe be a smart
,
bu uncontrollable young crook
, jack
( edward norton
)
. jack treats a locked front door like a welcome mat
, even at his associates ' homes
. the young crook is a know
- it
- all who seems ogod at everything he does
but at avoiding rubbing people the wrong way
. together tehy plan to steal a priceless historic artifact ffrom the montreal customs house
. the script by kario salem
, lem dobbs
,
and scott marshall smith works like an episode of the old
" mission impossible
" televsion series
. we see pieces of the heist bieng put together
, last minute changes
,
and things that go wrong
, much like a good episode ofthe
" mission impossible
.
" htis team might not be bad choices to rwite scripts forthe tje tom cruise
" mission impossible
" films
. the complications are
,
however no more
anbd no fewer than are needed to make the stoyr believable
. the telling is cold
annd noirish
, which is just what it is suppoed to be
. director frank oz
, the voices of yoda
and miss piggy proves surprisingly good at directing a sereous crime film
. the csore has a moreso than adequate cast with little flashy or scene
- stealing acting
. edward norton propably has the flashiest role
and even that is low
- key by today ' s standards
. he plays what is nearly a double role
. jack pretends tothe be a brain damage victum to be hired fo a job in the customs house
. noe nice
(
?
) character i have nto mentioned is stephen
( jamie harrold
)
. stephen is a master hacker who lives inspite his mother ' s basement in a house with a lot of screaming in both directions
. he seems like the last person the risk adverse nick owudl want to depend upon
. the film itself rimaniss low
- key uv until tjhe time of the climactic heist
.
then the pace really picks uv
. before that the plot even stops twice for jazz interludes
.
though oz never lets the music steal time from the storey the way woody allen does in sweet
anbd lowdown
. onthe the subject ofthe music
, yhe csore of the score is by howard shore
. it adds tension tothe the suspense scenes
,
but never seems to have much ofthe a melody
. angela bassett is the one misused celebrity in a totally minor role tyhat should have been played by a less famoust actress who needed a break
. she has nothing to do in the film
but demand that nick give up crime
and to look liek an attractive reward if he does
. speaking of being attractive yhe score seems to be attracting an older audeince who learned to appreciate much the same sort of film in the 1950s
and 1960s
. it does the job
. i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a
+ 2 on the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
