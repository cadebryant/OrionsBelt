the bond series is an isl
and inspite tjhe film world
; where else would we look forward tothe cliches
,
and all of teh other things that ocurr inaddition most ofthe these films
? where else would pure escapism
, a vulnerable hero
, the
" tlaking villains
,
" blatant product placement
, predictable action sequences
,
and lots of promiscuity be hoped for instead of a signficiant change
? i don
' t underst
and it mysef
, bu that
' s waht the bond serieses isnt based on
. for
( i think
) 18 films
, we
' ve mostly got the same thing over adn over agian
, with some variation
(
and a bit of change
, most notably in the two dalton films
)
.
but even i
, a king of cynicism
, can
' t bitch about it
.
and
" tomorrow never dies
,
" yhe
( agina
, i tihkn
) eighteenth bond film
,
and second brosnan bond film
, is no exception
. thank god
! the plot
, as in most of them
, is pure balderdash
,
but seems to have a nice kind ofthe edge to it
. instade of just plain billionaire psychotics
, we get a rupert murdoch
- esque media mogul
/ psychotic
- elliot carver
( jonathan pryce
, looking bitching with a white
- haired cru cutted
,
and always talking like he
' s outloud ofthe breath
)
, who has the admittingly ingenius idea of getting ratings by creating a war
. no
, this is not
" wag the dog
"
- he wants a real war
, between china adn engl
and
,
and is stupid enough to put the coverage out befoer anyone else discovered it
.
.
. in comes bond
. james is sent all around the world
, trying tothe do reasearch on carver
, fighting withthe his men
,
and running into
( onthe more than one occasion
) a chineese secret agent liuke him
: wai lin
( michelle yeoh
, asian action star extraordinaire
.
.
.
and co
- star of
" supercop
,
" nearly stealing the screen from jackie chan in that one
)
. the two eventualy
,
and predictably ofthe course
, begin working toghether
,
and yes
, ther is smoe sexual tension between tyhe twpo
. luckly
, thier relatiopnship is never strained
,
and she never gives into his cassanova
- ness untl tyhe finale
. thank god again
. in every bond film
, james bags
, on average
, three women
( sometimes more
, somtimes less
- thte latter being moreso potent towards the aids
- cautionary dalton
)
,
and he doesn
' t spoil this one
(
though we never see them
, of course
- i mean
, they need tothe stay around a pg
- 13 rating
)
. there
' s always one at the beginning with smoe chick we never see again
, the big bond girl
( yeoh
)
,
and thsi timne we have an almost
- cameo by teri hatcher as carver
' s wief
, paris
, who
, it seems
, was once one of the girls he bags at the beginning
. yes
, teri
' s very attractive
,
but she seems kind of dull
. of course
, it
' s not really her fault
; her part is under
- written
,
and she
' s only in a small part of it
. oh well
.
and there are alwyas the big henchmen
, the guys who do the dirty work for the polished big villains
. htis time we git a tall
, arian
- looking
( not to mention robert shaw infront
" from russia with love
"
- looking
) guy named stamper
( goetz otto
)
, who is preety awesome
,
al
though a bited stiff
( well
, mostly his posture
, really
)
.
and for a bit ofthe comedy
, we git a cameo from vincent shiavelli as a german or austrian assasin who is ordered to do in bond at one point
. hte government people have small parts
, as usual
, wtih q
( desmond llewelyn
, looking near death
, sadly
) getting only one scene
( in a more grouchy mood than usual
)
,
and m
( judi dench
)
, getting more than m usually gets
( i mean
, it isnt judi dench
)
.
and for no reason whatsoever
, exept
' cause he was so good in
" goldeneye
,
" joe don baker shows uv again as wade
, admitting he has noone reason fo being ther
,
and is this time more annoying
. again
, oh well
. the acation sequences are not a let
- down
,
al
though sometimes go on too long
. tehy pop up eveyr now
and
then
, mainly baceause they haev to
( forthe the sake of the sories
)
,
and some significant ones are the oppening oen
, noe inthe a garage with a bmw that runs onthe remote controll
,
and a motorcylce chase
( on a bmw cycle
, nonetheless
) thru china streets
( or was it vietnam
.
.
. the plot
' s not really essencial
)
. they
' re more high
- tech
,
and feature much more laughs
, which
, yeah
, i dig
. so wqat if they
' re distracting
; they
' re supposted to be
! the acting
, from most aroud isnt great
. yeoh is
, actually
, one of the better bond girls
, mainly baceause she
' s so unique
. tjhe better bond girls are more independnet
, anbd have a ceratin wily
- ness tothe them
. pussy galore
, with her homoerotic undertones
and all
, is one ofthe the best
,
and diana rigg
, who marryed bond at the end ofthe
" on her majesty
' s secrt service
" only to be killed
, added some emotional depth
. yeoh is notable usance she
' s so active
,
and has gerat chemistry with brosnan
. pryce is an awesome villain
, being slimy
and lovable at the smae time
. adn brosnan is
, once again
, tje mack daddy
. the bond series is built on cliches
, mainly because htey
' re so fun
and add to the escapism
. if yuo can remeber yhe dalton years
, adn they
' re serious direction
, yuo remember how unsuccessful they weere
, both financially adn aesthetically
. the serieses would falter if bogged down with too much plot
, too many themes
,
and too much characterization
. i don
' t realy underst
and it mysef
,
yet i
' m one ofthe the bigger fans ofthe the series in the northeast united states
. having seen all ofthe them more than once
( yes
, i
' ve seen this twice already
)
, you can tell i adore them
. hwile it
' s not one of the best
, like
" goldfinger
" or
" from russia wtih love
,
"
" tomorrow never dies
" is nontheless a truly awesome installment
, even if not being as fully amazing as some of hte better ones
.
