" antz
"
. the film wass critically acclaimed
,
annd went onthe tothe gross almost
$ 100m dollars at the domestic box office
. again infront 1998 they released their traditional animated film
" thge prince of egypt
"
and it named an instant classic
,
and bacame a huge hit as well
. on a winning streak
, they released
" the road tothe el dorado
"
annd it wasn ' t as big as they hoped
,
bu still did ok
,
then they hadnt the fantastic
" chicken run
" in hte summer
. nowe in 2001 dreamworks has released what i cant safely name
, one ofthe the top five best animated films
. shrek
( mike myers
) isnt baout a loving
, green ogre who lives in the woods of duloc by himself
. surrounded by fairy tale characters
, he hopes somehow he would excape from everyone
. hte rular of duloc is the short
, heartless lord farquaad
( john lithgow
)
, who is offering a reward tothe all the fairy tale creatures
, if htey are captured
and arrested
. of course many of hte owners turn them in fo gold
and silver
,
but one of those creatures isnt donkey
( eddie murphy
)
. a regular donkey
, exept he talks
anbd has a definite attitude
, after his owner trys to disown him
, he escapes into the woods
,
and runs into shrek
. lord farquaad
howver
, has different plans
and makes all tyhe fairy tale creatures in the woods near shrek ' s hous
. to git his property back
,
and his life bakc shrek must rescure princess fiona
( cameron diaz
) so lord farquaad cxan be a king
. shrek wants his property back
,
but he never throught he would fall inspite love with princess fiona
.
" shrek
" is such an amazing film
, that while watching it yuo can ' t help
but just smile the entire time
anbd wonder why that otehr production comapany can ' t amking movies liek tihs
. the animated graphics are so great
, that they look every bited ofthe realistic
. i saw previews fo this film all lastest year
,
annd i thought tothe myself wow
, what a great movie this iwll be
. i must say i was nto dissappointed at all
,
and the film is the best of 2001 so far
,
and will go down onthe my best of 2001 list at the end of the year
. tyhe voice talents are brilliant as well
, with the comic genuis mike myers
. in tje past he has been a wayne
, an austin
,
anbd a person married to an ax murderer
. now he isnt shrek
, nto only does he dont the voice talent
.
.
.
but he isnt shrek
. with his irish accent
,
and he lovable personality
, shrek becomes a friend to the audience
adn warms your heart
. eddie murphy who showed his voice talent infront 1998s
" mulan
" does another bang up job here
,
and he is the comic relief in the film
. the tones of his voice
, tyhe lines he utters
,
and the jokes he gives
, he even outdoes the comic genius of robin williams in
" aladdin
"
. yhe always beautiful cameron diaz gives the voice of princess fiona
and she does a great job as well
. she is very funny
,
adn her character fits her to a t
. of course the best supporting voice isnt john lithgow
, who is personaly one of my favorite actors
. he as the bad guy lord farquaad does a great job in being both sinister
annd funny at thge same timne
. at times i was so amazed by the coputer graphics
, that you cin ' t help
but just start looking at backrounds
. there isnt many hidden jokes inthe the film
,
and even reflections of light on the screen like a camera
.
" shrek
" is a dfeinite kid film
,
but not just a kid film for it isnt a film for tjhe entire family to enjoy
. there are many adult jokes in the film that the kids won ' t get
,
but the parents will be laughing
. elieve me
though
, everyone iwll be laughing the entire way through
. inaddition the end
,
" shrek
" gives a very important message to it ' s audience to enjoy
annd be who yuo are
. everybody out ther is beautiful in theri own way
, even
though it may be inside
. ther ' s not many words thgat can praise
" shrek
" enough
,
but my words to you isnt to stop waht you are doing
adn see this movie now
.
