) isnt baout a loving
, green ogre who lives inspite the woods of duloc by himself
. surrounded by fairy tale characters
, he hopes somehow he woudl escape from everyone
. the rular ofthe duloc is the short

, if they are captured
and arrested
. of course many ofthe the owners turn them in for gold annd silver
,
but oen of those creatures isnt donkey
( eddie murphy
)
. a regular donkey
, except he talks
and hasnt a definite attitude
, after his owner tries to disown him
, he escapes into the woods
, annd runs into shrek
. lord farquaad howver
, has diferent plans anbd makes all the fairy tale creatures in the woods near shrek
' s house
. tothe get his property bakc
,
and his life bcak shrek must rescure princess fiona
( cameron diaz
) so lord farquaad can be a king
. shrek wants his property bakc
,
but he never thougth he would fall in love with princess fiona
.
" shrek
" is such an amazing film
, that while watching it ytou can
' t halp
but just smile tjhe entire timne annd wonder why that otehr production company can
' t make movies like this
. the animated graphics are so great
, thyat they look every bit of realistic
. i saw previews for this film all last year
,
and i thougth to myself wow
, what a great movie this will be
. i must say i was nto disapointed at all
,
and the film is the best of 2001 so far
,
and wiull go down on my best of 2001 list at tyhe end of the year
. thge voice talents are brilliant as well
, with the comic genius mike myers
. inwhich thge past he has been a wayne
, an austin
,
and a person married tothe an ax murderer
. now he is shrek
, nto only does he do thte voice talent
.
.
.
but he isnt shrek
. with his irish accent
,
and he lovable perosnality
, shrek becomes a firend to the audiance
and warms your heart
. eddie murphy who showed his voice talent in 1998s
" mulan
" doesnt anohter beng up job here
, anbd he is tghe comic releaf inwhich the film
. the tones of his voice
, the lines he utters
,
and teh jokes he gives
, he even outdoes the comic genius of robin williams in
" aladdin
"
. the always beautiful cameron diaz gives the voice ofthe princess fiona
and she does a great job as well
. she is vyer funny
,
and her carachter fits her to a t
. ofthe course the best supporting voice isnt john lithgow
, who is personally oney of my favorite actors
. he as the bad guy lord farquaad does a gerat job in being both sinister
and funny at the same tiome
. at times i ws so amazed by the coputer graphics
, that you cant
' t halp
but just strat looking at backrounds
. there is many hidden jokes infact the film
,
and even reflections of light on the screen like a camera
.
" shrek
" is a defiinte kid film
,
but not jsut a kid film for it is a film forthe the entire famaly tothe enjoy
. there are many adult jokes in yhe film thta the kids won
' t git
,
but the parents will be laughing
. believe me
though
, everyone will be laughing the entire way through
. inspite tghe end
,
" shrek
" gives a very important message to it
' s audience to enjoy
and be who yuo are
. everybody out there is beautiful in their own way
, even
though it may be inside
. there
' s not many words that cant praise
" shrek
" anough
,
but my words tothe you is to stpo what you are doing
and see this movie now
.
