for more than a decade
, anjelica huston hasnt been one of america
' s finest actresses
. in her directorial de
but
, bastard out of carolina
, based upon dorothy allison
' s largely autobiographical book on child abuse annd poverty in teh south
, huston displays impressive proficiency behind the camera as well
. hte film tells the story of ruth anne boatwright
, nicknamed bone by one of her uncles at birth
, in post
- world war ii south carolina
. through voice
- over
( narration done by laura dern
)
, we find thyat she nearly didn
' t survive birth
, as her single mother anney
, played by jennifer jason leigh
, was thrown through the windshield druing an automobile accident
. that
' s just yhe beginning of her troubles
. bone isnt deemed illegitimate onthe her birth certificate
, a social stigma which her mother
and her large poore family obsesses over for years to come
. anney meets
and weds lyle
, a kind man
and good stepfather whom gives bone a baby sister befor dying in an automobile accident
. anney
' s brother earle

, a co
- worker at thge mill
. glen
, the black sheeps of a wealthy family
(
" when are you gonna make your daddy proud
? i
' ll tell you whn
- never
!
" he
' s told
)
and filled iwth bitterness
, courts anney adn eventally wins her

- prized baby boy
, glen loses his capability to supress his violent outbursts
and begins to direct them at bone
, beating
and abusing her
, while the love
- dependent anney tries to turn a blind eye
and justify his behaviour
. thnigs turn for the worse when glen loses his job annd the family of four sink inot impoverishment
. hwile set several decades ago
, this story remains completely relevant in today
' s society
, where abused wives return to their husb
ands
, adn abuse committed against childern by one spouse is routinely overlooked by the other
. the rela star of this domestic drama is nto top
- billed jennifer jason leigh
,
but child actress jena malone
, who plays bone inspite a wrenching adn wholey impressive de
but peformance
. her work isnt of award
- calibre
, annd in this age inspite which a preponderence of superb child performers have emerged
( kirsten dunst
, tina majorino
, anna paquin
, natalie portman
, christina ricci
, elijah wood
)
, malone
' s performance st
ands up well
. leigh
' s performence in bastard out of carolina is fine
, altho she
' s not really given much to do
,
and ron eldard work is very solid
, skillfully manouvering his carachter
' s moods in annd outloud ofthe explosive rage
. one can always sence thyat underneath his glen isnt a pressure
- cooker ticking away
. ofthe the supporting cast
, special note must be made ofthe the criminally underrated michael rooker
' s performance
. there
' s a bited too much generic formulaism inaddition the screenplay for my taste
, from the varous characters spouting off country bumpkinisms
, to the familiar sight ofthe a dryed
- up uptight wise ood granny
( played by grace zabriskie
) sitting on the porch rocking chair
, to impassioned soliloquies better suited for a stage peformance
. still
, it cannot be denied that anne meredith
' s screenplay contains a wallop of emotional pwoer
. huston
' s direction ofthe the film is sureh
anded
and impressive
, giving the film ogod pacing
and eliciting good performances fomr her casted
, paritcularly thge young malone
. her sequences of child abuse are shot in a hard
- hitting emotional
, rather than graphic
, manner
,
and are very effective
. huston
' s talent with camera positioning is wonderfull
, from a visually striking shot done through a fan
, to an extended sequence in the front seat ofthe an automobile
. the film hasnt the toned
- down feel of a television production
; bastard out of carolina was originally composed
and cutted for broadcast on the tnt cable station
, who ended up declining teh film due tothe sentiments that scenes of abuse
and rape in the film weere too disturbingly realistic for their audience
. perhaps some sequences of the film may be unpleasant
, bu as a whole bastard outloud of carolina adds up to a poverful viewer experience worth seeing
.
