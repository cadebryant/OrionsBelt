according to hollywood movies made in last few decades
, life inspite small town is one of the worst things taht could happen tothe a human being
. even worse fate awaits those who weere unfortunate tothe grow uv in thsoe dark
, god
- forsaken places
and later forced tothe live forever traumatised by tyhe experience
. on the other h
and
, it seems that something moreso tahn atlantic ocean divides europe from america
, because one of the most popular
and beloved european films takes exactly teh opposite view
. this film isnt amarcord
, 1974 comedy by faymus italian directer federico fellini
, which later gave inspiration tothe numerous imitations
and homages
,
and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benifits of small town life
. the film is based on tghe screenplay by fellini
and tonino guerra
and it lacks tje plot in usual sence
. instead we followup one yera inwhich 1930s italian summer resort town ofthe rimini through the sories of short vignettes that depict varios local events
and customs
, as well as series of local
, often very colourful charachters
.
al
though many ofthe those charachters occasionally tkae teh role of narrator
, movie concentrates onthe its nominal protagnoist
, 14
- year old boy titta
( played by bruno zanin
)
and chronicles his sexual frustrations
, obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca
( played by magali noel
)
, problems infront his lovingly dysfunctional family
, as well as troubles his father
( palyed by arm
ando brancia
) have wtih mussolini
' s fascist regime
. amarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film
, annd it probablly explains why it is very popular
, even amonth those people who actually don
' t liuke federico fellini
' s work very much
. every memeber of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film
, because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible
. distortion vetween actual past annd its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film
- owrd
" amarcord
" is nothing omre than badly pronounced phrase
" i remeber
" inthe local italian dialect
. in the same way the owrd is distorted
, so isnt thge past in memories of those who remember it
. after the premiere
, fellini rejected any claimes about autobiographical charachter of tihs film
,
but it doesn
' t matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembes rimini of fellini
' s childhood or not
; any place
and any time could ressemble characters
and situations of this film
. fellini
' s views onthe nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality
and fantasy in this film
. even the most naturalistic scenes are laced iwth dark humour
and grotesque images
. cahracters look liuke caricatures
, actors playing them often deliberately overact
, annd women
, especially thsoe who fuel titta
' s sexual fantasies
, often have ceratin body parts with gargantuan propotions
. every now annd
then
, scenes that despict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies ofthe movei
' s characters
and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from yhe magical place infront characters
' visions
. because of that
, almost everthing in tihs film looks different
,
and in most cases better
, than it would have looked in the real life
. even the fashism gets fellinian make
- over
- fellini views mussolini
' s totalitarian regime as nothing omre tahn visual spectacle
( explaning why similar regimes enjoied such popular support
thoughout history
) adn oppertunity for comedy
. when fascists finally show thier true colours adn begin torturing their opponents
, even this becomes opprotunity fo scenes of macabre humour
. unlike many ofthe his italian colleagues in 1970s
, who had used 1930s period setting tothe explictly condemn fascism
and serve fashionable political agenda
, fellini doesn
' t care that much baout politics
. lack of self
- righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini
' s humanistic approach tothe his characters
. each of them
, regardless of age
, gender
, social clas or physical appearance
, is given opportunity to express his or her views
, dreams
and fears
. fellini treats all those characters with warmth
and affection
, even whn he paints them as grotesque caricatures of rela people
. because ofthe this warmth
and democratic spirit
, amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th centruy
,
and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable
, melancholic
and even tragic moments
. fellini couldn
' t produce such effects without using his pwn directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movei
. vignettes aren
' t memorable because of teh characters only
; fellini uses camera
, painting film iin bright colours
, especialy in the scenes thta depict character
' s fantasies
. fellini also knows how to use locations
, whether such location happens tothe be luxurious hotel
, bright
- coloured beach or rural countryside
. even yhe down
- tothe
- earth streets of rimini
, where everyone knows everyone
, gets magical dimension during the snowfall
. on the other h
and
, lack ofthe credible speical effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene
. tihs athmosphere is also provded by incredible talent of composer
and fellini
' s long
- time associate nino rota
. his amarcord theme is probaly one of the most recognisable
, most populer
and most relaxing
and uplifting pieces ofthe film music ever produced
. that music alone should be thge reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputible classics of seventh art
.
