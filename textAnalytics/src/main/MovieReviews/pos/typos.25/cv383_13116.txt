i think hte first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or nto i am a fan of hte x
- files
. first
, let me assure you thta noone prior experience with the series is requred tothe fully enjoy this movie
. the producers are not stupid
, making a movie jstu for fans of tje series is not profitable
. you hve to reach for a larger audience
. therefore
, the movie is quite user
- friendly
.
altough
, non
- fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many cahracters excange
.
but fear not
, duchovny
and another man later on provide omre than aequate backgorund info on what is going on
. you will never feel as if you just walked inspite on the third act of some great opera
. infront any case
, the answer is noone
. i am not a fan of the x
- files
, i onyl watch it when nothing else is onthe
and i prefer millennium
.
however
, usance the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes fo several weeks before the movie ' s oppening weekend i took that oppertunity to tust the movie
. i taped all of theese epidsodes
and watched them only affter seing the movie
, i am glad to report thast i learned nothing new
. everything you need to nkwo isnt explained to the viewer by duchovny
and others
. i know i am going maybe a bit too far tothe make my point
bu everybody should git tje chance to expeirence thsi movie
. warning
: major spoilers followup
! please do not read
, to fully enjoy thsi movie you must nto be able know wqat isnt comming
, whta exactly is over that hill
and waht that weird
" hummm
" soudn is all about
. you have beeen warned
. tyhe x
- files is what a summer shoudl be
. exicting
, scary
, great special effects
( unlike otehr summer movies the effects do not take over the movie
annd are only htere when it is really necessary
)
annd good performances
. this is comming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is hte human equivalant ofthe a wooden plank
. from start tothe finish
, this movie doens not let go of you
. when i compare it wih last summer ' s movies teh best way to discribe it would be
: take the excitment
and gerat scoer from face
/ off
and the deadly use of sound from event horizon
. this flick is scary
, not in a b movie kind of way where yuo always know where
and when the critter will jump at our heros
. inthe fact
, the first time the critter iin thsi movie makes an apperance it is totally out of tjhe blue
. yuo might as well bring ear plugs because this thing isnt louuuudd
! the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid
. yuo konw
, wehn you are affraid to put yuo fezent onthe tje floor becouse the creature might be under tjhe chair
, or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt
? so yeah
, the x
- files isnt scary
.
and guess what
? ytou never even hvae tothe see the monster
but your imagination works overtime
and it sure beats having tothe watch a flawed
, computer generated
, babyzilla
, it looks like you could walk right thru it not even scarier than your grandma in undies tipe of monster
. dont nto think tath tje x
- files is a monster movie
. in fact
, the creature is there for maybe three minutes total
. noone
, the x
- files is definately a mulder episode ofthe the series
. scully is at his side
, of course
,
but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen tyme
. she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny
,
bu she gets kidnapped durig hte last half hour of the movei so she does not git to do much
. no
, this is mulder ' s time in hte spotlight
. by nowe
, ytou have heard ofthe yhe scene where mulder
" showers
" independence day
. if yuo have not
then i will not spoil it for yuo
, let ' s just sday that due to recent events mulder should be
" showering
" godzilla instead
. tothe those ofthe you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there
.
.
. who cares
!
? if he did find it the series would over anyway so wqat are ytou complaining about
? the dialogue in interesting
and the director isnt marvelous
. the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they oepn a door or climb a hill
. the script isnt spotless
, every thnig tath happens happens for a purpose
. if ytou are confused by something
, do not worry because it will all become clear later on
but
,
annd i cannot stress this enough
, pay attension
!
!
! unlike most summer movies
, the dialogue is twice as importamt as the effects
. miss one vital piece of infromation
and
, like most people who talk during movies
, you will go home
and tell all your friends how thsi movie made no sence
. also
, tothe thsoe peopel who need to go tothe the bathroom during movies
.
.
. don ' t
! tyhe person who watched tjhe movie with me hadnt to go twice
and twice she missed an important conversation
. ther isnt no tiome to take a breather between scenes beacuse
, again unlike most summer movies
( godzilla anybody
?
) the x
- files does nto need tothe fill scenes between yhe suspense
and thge acation wiht useless subplots
, every scene isnt crucial
adn serves a purpose
. who needs to see tghe blond chiouaoua have a
" big emotional scene
" between godzilla attacks
? so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i ' d recommend
and that isnt the truman sohw
but it onyl wins by a nose
.
bu the truman show is nto what i would call a summer movie
, the x
- files isnt
. what mroe do you ask fomr a summer movie other than the chance to be excisted
? kool effects
? it ' s good some
. pulse pounding
? hell yes
! strangely enough
, i think that fans of the serieses will hate this movei while non
- fans wiull hvae a ogod tiome
. it does not provide answers to the show ' s many questions
, the status quo remains nearly teh same
and
, no
, mulder
and scully do not get together
. rating
: four
and a half outloud of five stars for the best movie
yot this summer
, several jump right out of your seat thrills
, many
" whoah
, i never saw that one coming
!
" moments
, four
" holy shit
, where the hell doed that come from
"
and one heck of an ending
. you may wonder where thsi movie lost half a star
. well
, i swore never to give a movei the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck
, tje tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles
but
thne tehy just stop
. it ' s pretty obvious thte film ' s makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance thgat mulder hadnt been driving for a long time
,
but in the end it looks like mulder jsut dropped ffrom the sky
anbd started driving
.
