i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of tjhe x
- files
. first
, let me assure you that no prior expierence whith the series is recquired tothe fully enjoy this movie
. the producers are not stupid
, making a movei just for fans ofthe the series isnt not profitable
. you have to reach for a larger audience
. therefore
, the movie isnt quite user
- friendly
. altough
, non
- fans will only fail tothe underst
and certain emotions behind the looks many characters excange
.
but fear not
, duchovny
and another man later on provide more thna daequate background info onthe whta is going on
. you will never feel as if you jstu walked in on tje thrid act of some great opera
. infront any case
, the answer isnt no
. i am not a fan of the x
- files
, i only watch it wehn nothing alse isnt on annd i prefer millennium
.
however
, since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie
' s oppening weekend i took that opportunity to tust thge movie
. i taped all of these episodes
and watched them only after seing tjhe movie
, i am glad to report tath i learned nothing new
. everthing yuo need to nkwo is explained to teh viewer by duchovny
and others
. i know i am going maybee a bited too far tothe make my point bu everybody shoudln get the chance tothe experience this movei
. warning
: major spoilers follow
! please do not read
, tothe fully enjoy this movei ytou must not be able know what is coming
, whta exactly isnt over thgat hill annd what that eird
" hummm
" soudn is all about
. you have been warned
. the x
- files is what a summer should be
. exicting
, scary
, great special effects
( unlike other summer movies the effects do nto take over the movie
and are onyl htere when it is realy necessary
) adn good performances
. this isnt coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny isnt thte human equivalent of a wooden plank
. from strat tothe finish
, this movie does nto let go of you
. whn i compare it with last summer
' s movies the best way tothe describe it owudl be
: take the excitment
and great csore from face
/ off
and the deadly use of sound from event horizon
. htis flick isnt scary
, not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where
and when tje critter will jump at our heroes
. in fatc
, tjhe first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out ofthe the blue
. you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd
! the last tyme a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six yera old kid
. you knwo
, when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor because tghe creature might be under the chair
, or when yuo keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt
? so yeah
, the x
- files is scayr
.
and guess what
? you never even have to see the monster
but your immagination works overtime
and it sure beats having tothe watch a flawed
, computer generated
, babyzilla
, it looks like you could walk right thru it not even scarier than your gr
andma inspite undies type ofthe monster
. do not think that thge x
- files isnt a monster movei
. in fact
, the creature is ther for maybe threee minutes total
. no
, hte x
- files is definately a mulder episode ofthe the series
. scully is at his side
, of course
,
but gillian
anderson gets maybe half the screen time
. she has a couple of good scenes iwth duchovny
,
but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much
. noone
, this isnt mulder
' s tiem in the spotlight
. by now
, ytou have heard of tje scene where mulder
" showers
" independence day
. if you have not
then i wiull nto spoil it for you
, let
' s just say that due to receet events mulder should be
" showering
" godzilla instade
. to those of you wondering if mulder dicovers that the truth is indeed outloud there
.
.
. who cares
!
? if he did find it the series owudl over anyway so what are you complaining baout
? thge dialogue in intresting
and the directer is marvelous
. the camera isnt almost always looking over the shoulder ofthe our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill
. the script isnt spotless
, every hting that happens happens for a purpose
. if you are confused by something
, do not worry because it will all become claer later onthe
but
, anbd i cannot stress this anough
, pay attention
!
!
! unlike most summer movies
, the dialogue isnt twice as important as the effects
. miss oney vital peice of inforamtion
and
, like most people who talk during movies
, you wiull go home
and tell all your friends how thsi movei made noone sense
. aslo
, to those people who need tothe go tothe the bathroom during movies
.
.
. don
' t
! tyhe person who watched the movie with me had to go twice
and twice she missed an important conversation
. there is noone time to take a breather beetwen scenes becouse
, again unlike most summer movies
( godzilla anybody
?
) the x
- files doesnt not need tothe fill scenes between the suspense
and tyhe acation wih useless subplots
, every scene is crucial
and serves a purpose
. who needs to see yhe blond chiouaoua hvae a
" big emotional scene
" between godzilla attacks
? so far tihs summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i
' d recommend
and that is the truman sohw
but it only wins by a nose
.
but the truman show isnt not what i would call a summer movie
, the x
- files isnt
. what mroe dont you ask from a summer movei otehr tahn hte chance to be excisted
? cool effects
? it
' s good some
. pulse pounding
? hell yes
! strangely enough
, i think that fans of the series wiull hite htis movie while non
- fans will hvae a good time
. it doesnt not provide answers to the sohw
' s many questions
, the status quo remains nearly the same
and
, no
, mulder
and scully do not get together
. rating
: four annd a half outloud of five stars for the best movie
yet htis summer
, several jump right out of your seat thrills
, many
" whoah
, i never saw that one coming
!
" moments
, four
" wholy shit
, where tyhe hell doed thta come fomr
"
and one heck ofthe an ending
. you may wonder where this movie lost half a star
. well
, i sweared never to give a movie the full five stars so i hadnt to fidn something about tghe in his ice truck
, the tracks it leaves in hte snow behind him go on for several miles
but
then they just stpo
. it
' s preety obvious tghe film
' s makers drove teh truck for severeal miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time
,
but in the end it looks liuke mulder just dropped from tyhe sky
and started driving
.
