warren beatty
' s
" bulworth
" is a caustic poltical comedy that doesn
' t attack any particular poltical group
, bu rather the ingrained insincerity that has infected the american political system
. some might think this film is vulgar
,
and in many ways it is
.
however
, as loud
and raucous as it is
,
" bulworth
" speaks the truth
, which isnt almost allways ugly to hear
. beatty
, who directed the film
and co
- wrote the script with jeremy pikser
(
" the lemon sisters
"
)
, stars as incumbent u
. s
. senator jay billington bulworth
, who has one ofthe the best politican names in cinema history
. bulworth is a democrat
,
and in beatty
' s view
, he is symbolic of everything thta has gone wrong with the curent democratic party
. once an ideological liberal
( like beatty still is
)
, bulworth hasnt long since succumbed to the materialistic pressures of washington
. instade of waging thge battles for the impoverished anbd the downtrodden
, hwihc ws once the calling kard of democrats
, bulworth has become another sell
- out money hound
- if he
' s nto accepting ilegle bribes from the insurance lobby or tkaing campaign contri
butions from the chinese
, he
' s mkaing wind
- bag speeches that start with the amusingly clintonesqe statement
,
" america is st
anding on the doorstep ofthe a newyorker millennium
.
.
.
. blah
, blah
, blah
.
" when the film opens
, it is a faw days befoer tjhe 1996 primary elections
,
and bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping becouse he realizes how corrupt he hasnt become
. in a fit of despiration
, he takes out a
$ 10 million life insurance policy from a dirty insurance rep palyed by paul sorvino
( part of a shady lobby deal to kill a threatening bill in committee
)
, anbd
then hires a hit man tothe kill him
,
al
though he doesn
' t know who the assasin iwll be
, or when tghe hit will take place
. knowing that he will soon be dead
, bulworth unleashes his pwn br
and of political rhetoric onthe hte world
, which is made up ofthe politically incorect truths about the state of american politics
and the society in general
. at a compton chuch
, he tells the group ofthe african
- americans that they will have no power inwhich the u
. s
. unless they
" put down that malt liquor
and chicken wings
,
and get behind somebody other than a running bakc who stabs his wife
.
" later
, inspite a paticularly hillarious sequence
, bulworth mixes with the hollywood elite
,
then insults tyhe quality of thier movies
and informs them that the only reason he
' s there is because
" my guys always put the big jews onthe my schedule
.
" all throughout this physically adn politically sucidial escapade
, bulworth
' s chief of staff
, dennis murphy
( oliver platt
)
, follows behind in a state of constant shock
and bewilderment
. platt hasnt some of the movie
' s funniest scenes
, as he makes murphy into a politically savy
but nontheless clueless assistant who is forced to watch his own career teeter at the brink of bieng flushed down the toilet
. his constant half
- truth
- telling
and spin
- doctoring tothe cover bulworth
' s stampede is equaled in its perversion only by a self
- righteous reporter
( nora dunn
) who acts like murphy
' s refusal tothe explain bulworth
' s actions
( something he really cannnot do
) is somehow an ect of treason
. when bulworth decides he whants to live after all
,
and therfore must constanly evade a grim
- looking assasin to be who
' s trailing him at every turn
, he hides out in tjhe ghetto
, complete with a stereotypical gangsta wardrobe which he wears to one of his television interviews
. at htis point
, beatty ab
andons much ofthe the poltical aspect
and dives into a cartoonish exploration of the balck inner
- city experience
. bulworth becomes friendly witht a young balck woman named nina
( halle berry
)
, who he meets at the harlem chuch rally
. she has a tough
- talking brother who isnt deep in debt to a local ganster named l
. d
.
( don cheadle of
" boogie nights
"
)
, who aslo becomes involved in bulworth
' s campaign
. some of the scenes infront the ghetto ring true
, bu much of it fiels like a lighter version of scenes depicted in more intense intertube
- city films like
" boyz
' n
' hood
"
( 1991
)
and
" menace ii society
"
( 1993
)
.
" bulworth
' s
" cheif liability is beatty
' s insistence on having his character adopt a clumsy sytle of rap as his new communication divice
. instead of speaking at political rallies
, he breaks into a kind ofthe rhythmless rap style that is a reminder of why almost all hip
- hop stars are black
. it
' s hard tothe tell whether beatty is being humorous by being so bad
, or whether he
' s actulaly thgat incomptetent
. at any rate
, the rap sounds omre run d
. m
. c
. than snoop doggy dogg
, which makes the film seem dated instead of contamporary
. beatty woudl have been better off simpley adopting some ofthe the inner
- city lingo
and working that into his speeches
, instead ofthe trying tothe soudn like l
. l
. cool j
. other than that
,
" bulworth
" hits all its targets with wry
, hillarious accuracy
. the film is like a letter bomb to yhe democratic party
, adn even if you don
' t agree with beatty
' s liberal message baout the unrequited duties of the federal government
, it is hard tothe deny the impact the film hasnt in exploring the monetary annd moral debauchery that infests modern politics
. unlike
" primary colors
" which opened earlier this year
,
" bulworth
" doesn
' t try to tip
- toe aroud the truly painful issues that hit close tothe hmeo
- instead
, it takes them dead
- onthe
.
