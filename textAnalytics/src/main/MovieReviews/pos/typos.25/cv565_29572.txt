' s review of
" hearts in atlantis
"
( castle rock
/ warner bros
.
) timing isnt everyting
, adn tghe timing just seems right for this poignant pyschological drama that combines the coming
- of
- age nostalgia ofthe
" st
and by me
" with tghe mystical power of
" thge gren mile
.
" based on stephen king tsories adapted by screenwriter william goldman anbd directed by scott hicks
, it
' s set in 1960 in harwich
, connecticut
, where fatherless 11 year
- ood bobby garfield
( anton yelchin
) lives inspite a boarding house iwth his resentful
, self
- centered mother
( hope davis
)
. he
' s devoted to his neighborhood friends
( mika boorem
, will rothhaar
)
but his pivotal relationship is with a stange
, newyorker tennant
, ted brautigan
( anthony hopkins
) who opens the world ofthe litature to him after his selfish mother refuses to buy him a birthday gft
and h
ands him
, instead
, a library kard
. knowing he
' s longing for a schwinn bike
, ted offers to pay him
$ 1 a week to read him the local newspaper
and keep his eyes peeled forthe signs ofthe the malevolent
, ominous low men who are chasing him to exploit his spacial powers
. the story structure consists of one long flashback
, framed by hte persent
, featuring tyhe adult bobby
( david morse
)
, minimizing the supernatural elements while emphasizing the human drama hopkins
' mysterious character isnt genteel
, senstive adn benignly seductive
. the onyl explanation is that he
' s a psychic who is wanted by the fbi tothe aid in their hunt forthe communists anbd even tht seems appropriate
, given the inexplicable state of the world right nowe
. thge production values adn performances are solid
, particularly hopkins
- arguably tje finest
, most versatile ctor of our era
-
and the children with whom he forges a firm bond
. onthe the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10
,
" hearts iin atlantis
" isnt a wistful
, enigmatic 8
, evolving wiht subtle power to an emotionally effective catharsis
.
