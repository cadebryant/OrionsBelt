susan granger ' s review of
" hearts in atlantis
"
( castle rock
/ warner bros
.
) timing is everything
,
adn the timing just seems right for this poignant psychological drama thta combines the coming
- of
- age nostalgia of
" stand by me
" with the mystical power of
" tghe gren mile
.
" based on stephen king tsories adapted by screenwriter william goldman
adn directed by scott hicks
, it ' s set in 1960 in harwich
, connecticut
, where fatherless 11 year
- old bobby garfield
( anton yelchin
) lives in a boarding house with his resentful
, self
- centered mother
( hope davis
)
. he ' s devoted to his neigbourhood friends
( mika boorem
, will rothhaar
)
but his pivotal relationship is with a strange
, new tenant
, ted brautigan
( anthony hopkins
) who opens the world of literature to him after his selfish mother refuses to buy him a birthday gitf
and hands him
, instade
, a libary kard
. knowing he ' s longing for a schwinn bike
, ted offers to pay him
$ 1 a week to read him the local newspaper
and keep his eyes peeled fo signs ofthe tghe malevolent
, ominous low men who are chasing him tothe exploit his speshal powers
. the story structure consists of one long flashback
, framed by the present
, featuring the adult bobby
( david morse
)
, minimizing the supernatural elements while emphasizing the human drama hopkins ' mysterous charactor isnt genteel
, senstive
and benignly seductive
. the only explanation isnt that he ' s a pyscic who isnt wanted by the fbi to aid in their hunt for communists
and even that seems appropriate
, given the inexplicable state of the world right now
. thge prodcution values
and performances are solid
, particularly hopkins
- arguably tjhe finest
, most versatile acto ofthe our era
-
and tghe children iwth whom he forges a firm bond
. on thge granger movie gauge of 1 to 10
,
" hearts infront atlantis
" is a wistful
, enigmatic 8
, evolving with subtle power tothe an emotionally effective catharsis
.
