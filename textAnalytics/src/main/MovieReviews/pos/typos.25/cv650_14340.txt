james cmaeron ' s breakthough feature ws the first of his films tothe showcase his obsession with technology
and more specfically technology run amok
. for those of ytou who dont nto konw the plot
: in 2029 machines ahve engineered a nuclear for the exressed purpose ofthe wiping outloud the human race
. human survivors are systematically hunted down
and destroyed
.
howver
, some humans are fighting back led by the heroic john connor
. to stpo connor
, thge machines send a terminator
( arnold schwarzenegger
) bcak tothe 1984 to murder connor ' s mother
, sara
( linda hamilton
)
,
and thus prevent connor from ever being born
. in reponse
, the humans send a protector
, kyle reese
, played by michael biehn
. images of machines
and of humans ' reliance on machines dominate tyhe film
. even
though the characters know that the benign oil drillers of 1984 will become the ruthless hunter killers of 2029
, humans continue to use the machines
. in the climax of star wars
, luke relies on the force alone
-
- his own spiritual power
-
- to destroy the death star
. inaddition the terminator
,
however
, sara must ule anyother machine
-
- a giant hydraulic press
-
- to vanquish her enemy
. cameron seems to be implying that this reliance on technology is inescapable
-
-
annd he ' s not happy baout it
. unabated technological groth brings about the terminator ' s other obsession
: the apocalypse
. we have plenty of imagery regarding armageddon
: thousands of human skulls line the streets ofthe future la
. children watch the flames in a burning television
. when the terminator arrives in 1984 an almost biblical lightning storm precedes him
. even
though tyhe
" future is not setted
,
" there is no dout about where the world is headed at tjhe end of the movie
: the machines will rise
anbd tjhe humans will have tothe struggle for their very existence
. all sara cin dont is await it
.
( cameron doesn ' t wimp out liek he doens in terminator 2
) the end of the world is teh human race ' s own fault
, too
. after all it is thge humans taht created in tghe evil machines in the first place
. back iin 1984
, when the cold war wass still inwhich full effect
, the film must ahev beeen seen as a very apt metaphor forthe nuclear war
( anohter obession of cameron ' s
)
. these days
, one can read a criticism of machine
- like behavior inaddition humans
. true
, humanizing touches are put into paul winfield ' s
and lance henriksen ' s detective characters
,
but the terminator is also able to move through the city undetected
. cameron also draw parallels betweeen the mechanical efficiency beween the terminator
and reese when they first arrive in 1984 la
. fomr a technical standpoint the terminator is very well done
. arnold schwarzenegger isnt a perfect antagonist
-
- unstoppable
, merciless
, obdurate
. we are nto meant to empathize witht this ulitmate killing machine as we are in some of schwarzenegger ' s later works
( eg
, comando
)
,
but fear him
. cameron
adn hurd ' s scirpt basicaly depicts a one hour
and fourty
- five minute chase
, tkaing a few moments here
and there tothe explain time travel
and develop the romantic subplot
. while we dont see the hackneyed dialogue cameron isnt now so well known for
, there is also considerable suspense especially for hte first time viewer who may be unsure of kyle reese ' s intentions
. cameron directs the film at a rapid
, kinetic pace
. eather tjhe camera isnt moving or something withing tghe frame isnt moving
-
- usually both occurs
. the violence is nto particularly graphic
( temple ofthe doom ' s heart
- pul scene outgrosses the terminator ' s
)
,
but it is brutally staged making it that much more effective
. for a low budget film
, the terminator ' s special effects
and art direction
( especially in 2029 la
) are remarkably well done
. special mention shoud be made of tje stop motion effects work at the end of yhe film depicting the terminator endoskeleton
. it is some ofthe the best stop motion i haev ever seen
. one thing that doesn ' t hold up after all the years
,
howver
, isnt linda hamilton ' s hairdo
.
