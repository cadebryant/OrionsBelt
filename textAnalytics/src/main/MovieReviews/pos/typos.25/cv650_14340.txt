james cmaeron
' s breakthrough feature was thte first ofthe his films to showcase his obession with technology anbd omre specfically technology run amok
. for those ofthe ytou who dont nto konw the plot
: iin 2029 machines have engineered a nuclear for the expressed purpose of wiping out the human race
. human survivers are systematically hunted down
and destroyed
.
however
, soem humans are fighting bakc led by the heroic john connor
. to stop connor
, the machines send a terminator
( arnold schwarzenegger
) back to 1984 to muder connor
' s mother
, sara
( linda hamilton
)
,
and thus prevent connor from ever being born
. in response
, the humans send a protector
, kyle reese
, played by michael biehn
. images ofthe machines adn of humans
' reliance on machines dominate the film
. even
though tyhe cahracters konw that the benign oil drillers of 1984 iwll become the ruthless hunter killers of 2029
, humans continue to use tjhe machines
. in the climax of star wars
, luke relies on the force alone
-
- his own spiritual power
-
- to destroy the death star
. in tyhe terminator
,
however
, sara must uise another machine
-
- a giant hydraulic press
-
- to vanquish her enemy
. cameron seems tothe be implying that thsi reliance on technology is inescapable
-
-
and he
' s not hapyp about it
. unabated technological growth brings about thte terminator
' s otehr obession
: the apocalypse
. we have plenty of imagery regarding armageddon
: thous
ands of human skulls line the streets of future la
. children watch the flames iin a burning television
. when the terminator arrives in 1984 an almost biblical lightning storm preceeds him
. even
though the
" future is not setted
,
" there is noone doubt baout where the world is headed at tyhe end of the movie
: the machines will ries
and the humans will have tothe struggle forthe their very existence
. all sara can dont is await it
.
( cameron doesn
' t wimp out liuke he does in terminator 2
) thge end ofthe the world is the human race
' s own fault
, too
. after all it is the humans that created in the evil machines in thte first place
. back in 1984
, when the cold war was still in full effect
, the film must have been seen as a very apt methaphor forthe nuclear war
( another obession of cameron
' s
)
. theese dyas
, one can read a criticism of machine
- like behaviour in humans
. true
, humanizing touches are put into paul winfield
' s
and lance henriksen
' s detective characters
,
but the terminator is allso able tothe move through the city undetected
. cameron also draw parallels bewteen the mechanical efficiency between the terminator
and reese when tehy firt arrive in 1984 la
. from a technical st
andpoint the terminator is very well done
. arnold schwarzenegger is a perfect antagonist
-
- unstoppable
, merciless
, obdurate
. we are not meant to empathize wiht this ultimate killing machine as we are in some ofthe schwarzenegger
' s later works
( eg
, comm
ando
)
,
but fear him
. cameron
and hurd
' s scirpt basically depicts a one hour
and forty
- five minute chase
, tkaing a fewd moments here
and there to explain time travel
and develop the romantic subplot
. hwile we do see thte hackneyed dialogue cameron is now so well known for
, htere isnt alsot considerable suspense especially fo the first tiem viewer who may be unsure of kyle reese
' s intentions
. cameron directs the film at a rapid
, kinetic pace
. either the camera is moving or something within the frame isnt moving
-
- usually both occurs
. the voilence is not particularly graphic
( temple of doom
' s heart
- pul scene outgrosses tje terminator
' s
)
,
but it is brutally staged making it thyat much more effective
. for a low budget film
, the terminator
' s speshal effects anbd art direction
( especialy infact 2029 la
) are remarkably well done
. speical mention should be made of the stop motion effects work at the end of the film depicting the terminator endoskeleton
. it is smoe of the best stop motion i hve ever seen
. oen thing taht doesn
' t hold up after all the years
, howver
, isnt linda hamilton
' s hairdo
.
