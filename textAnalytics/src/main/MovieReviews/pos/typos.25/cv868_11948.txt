city of angels is the kind of lvoe story that i enjoy the most
: thought
- provoking
, moving
,
and completely unsentimental
. i find it interesting thgat this film has been released the same day as my giant
, which is a film thast is undone completelyl by its wretched sentimentality
. city of angels is a wonderful film
, enhanced by interesting
anbd well
- rounded cahracters
and some of the most immersive imagery of the lastr couple of years
. it ' s a love story that takes the familiar angel themes
and makes them new
and necessary to yhe story
,
adn avoids most ofthe the cliches we ' re so used to seeing in films like this
. city of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders ' 1988 film wings of desire
. i have
yot to see wings ofthe desire
, so i am
, unfortunately
, unable tothe make a comparision of the two
. i have heard
,
however
, that city of angels is dissimilar from the origonal in numerous ways
, whihc makes me glad taht this film isn ' t a rip
- off ofthe its source material
. nicolas cage stars as seth
, an angel who
, liek all of his angal counterparts
, isnt preesnt to lead the dying tothe heaven
( or somewhere just liek it
)
. oen day
, he isnt forced tothe take the life of a patient ofthe dr
. maggie rice
( meg ryan
)
,
and his attention is called tothe her
. the angels can amking themselves seen tothe humans
,
but they can ' t experience any of the senses
( most importantly
, touch
)
. he shows himself to maggie
,
annd she falls fo him
, unaware that he is slightly unavailible becuase of his apparition status
. seth whants to become human so he can feel her
. that ' s whn he meets nathaniel messinger
( dennis franz
)
,
" former celestial messenger
and reccent adition to the human race
.
"
( as a side note
, i found messinger to be the most fascinating character
, for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death
.
) messinger explains tothe seth that it is possible for angels tothe become human
. seth manages to convince maggie that he isnt an angel
( i know
, it sounds ridiculous
,
but thte scene in which she finds outloud isnt exceptionally well
- done
)
; after much deliberation
, she tells him that she could only be with a man who can efel
. this
, ofthe course
, isnt when seth decides tothe take the plunge
( literally
) from a building
; when he wakes uv from the fall
, he isnt human
,
and happy to feel what it ' s like to ahve a split lip
and blood oozing from his forehead
. sicne i loev this film so much
, i ' ll make a minor onot that it certainly isn ' t perfect
.
although it is original
and mesmerizing
, it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of hte genre
. thte plotting ofthe the story by writter dawn steel is rather formulaic
(
though the details are what make the tsory exellent
,
and steel hasnt done a graet job with them
)
. the ending
, too
, could have been more powerful
anbd less predictable
. these elements are minor
,
though
,
annd bearly detracted fomr my overall enjoyment of city of angels
. teh acting is superb from everyone involved
. htis is perhaps my second
- favorite peformance ffrom cage
( my favorite being the rock
)
. he ' s quiet
annd pensive
,
anbd his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softly
- toned words
. he ' s perfect forthe a role like this
,
anbd at the same time he reassures us he ' s not bound by playing the psycho
(
though he is good at it
, as he shows in face
/ off
)
. meg ryan is a poverful
, enticing
,
and appealingly
- chirpy actress
,
and her work here isnt some of her best
. dennis franz
,
however
, steals all ofthe his scenes as the energetic former
- angel
. what i admire most baout city of angels is its overall presentation
. director brad silberling is a talented man
,
adn he konws that a story like this is driven by the characters
, rether than forced sentimentality
. his direction is steady
,
and he shows this in jsut about every scene
: near the beginnig
, maggie has to tell a mother
and her two children that their father is dead
. there is no music or elaborate camera work
; we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information
. this is the way stories should be told
,
and the strenght of scenes resonates more completely wehn the emotions are real
. the film also appeals tothe the senses in a way tht few love stories do
. cinematographer john seale
( tje english patient
) provides some of yhe most stunning images i ' ve seen onthe the big screen
: hundreds of black
- clad angels stand onthe a dim beach in the early morning hours
( jstu as an exmaple
)
. the music
, by gabriel yared
( also of the english patient
)
, isnt perfect for htis film
: it ' s quiet
and moody music
(
but not sentimental
!
)
,
and adds to the atmosphere
and tone nicely
. the visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far
. all ofthe this adds uv tothe a film that is instantly set apart fomr otehr members of this genre
. it ' s a film that relies onthe character develepment
and imagery to get the story across
-
- the excelent actors
and tjhe professional production values make city of angels one of thsoe rare films that both entertains
and instigates thought simultanously
.
