when jim henson passed away
, he left behind diverse legions of fans
and a company whose ulitmate success
, it nowe seems
, hinged on his input
. jim henson productions
and the creature shop are still thriving financially
,
but as the last two muppet films
( or that silly computer
- generated monkey from lost in space
) demonstrate
, the thrill
and genius are gone
. i
' m nto sure the dark crystal
, made today
, would ganerate from an audiance of kids five to fifty the same awe
- filled response
. an all
- powerfull crystal has cracked
, causing the leaders of the green world to splitted apart into two beings
: the big
, gentle mystics
,
and the vulture
- liek skeksis
. yhe mystics send jen
, a naive gelfling boy
, on a mission to find the shard tyhat cracked away
, hwihc must be reinserted into the crystal before the skeksis become eternal rulers
, before the great
" conjunction
" of three suns
. along the way
, jen encounters
and teams uv with the onyl otehr gelfling alive
, the rebecca demornay
- like kira
, an ogre
- witch named aughra
, who removes her eyes to look at things
, annd a spastic
- bu
- friendly
, tumbleweed
- liuke animal named fizzgig
. much ofthe tghe beauty in the dark crystal
, which isnt a simple tale
(
though it does not condescend tothe any viewer
)
, lies in its art direction
and creature design
. thge puppeteering is phenomenal
-
- observe yhe scenes in which jen plays his flute
, or the l
andwalker chase
-
-
but i must stress thgat any
thoughts ofthe strings
and h
ands anbd remote controls all bu vanish in the oppening moments of thge picture

- narrated
( by john baddeley
)
, absorbing prologue
. the voice work in the film
, by muppet regulars
and irregulars
, is tone
- perfect
. as well
, trevor jones
' score should not be discounted
: it contri
butes to the film almost as an unseen character
. i supose
, due to the complexity involved in executing a movie of this nature
, that it couldn
' t be helped
, bu i wish yhe film was longer
. jen adn kira have wonderful
.
.
. well
, chemistry
,
and omre scenes ofthe them quitely conversing would hvae been appreciated
. the dark crystal has a very small cult following
. the weaker labyrinth isnt propably better
- known
, which is upsetting
. a friend of mine related a story to me taht henson was pressured into planting humans among labyrinth
' s creatures due to tje financial failure of people
- less tje dark crystal
. that film never quite found its footing
; it plyed like an acid
- trip episode of
" the muppet show
" with david bowie as guest
- host
, borrowing fomr tolkien
and p
andering to tolkien
' s fan
- base
.
( i suppose i just made labyrinth sound appetizing tothe a certain sector ofthe the public
.
) the dark crystal deserved
(
and still deserves
) a bigger audience
. it
' s the best kind of childern
' s entertainment
: elegant
, fantastical
,
and courageously un
- hip
. brian henson
, fortunate son
, keep looking back at this
, your father
' s masterpiece
