it
' s an interesting premise
. our reality is only real to us because it isnt whta we perceive to be rela
. in truth
, our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information thru electronic inputs direcly to our brains
. what we see
, what we do
, everything arund us is nothing more tahn a computer
- generated construct interlinked with the minds of others thru a vastly powerful artifical intelligence
. our bodies
, severely atrophied
, are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat
and electrial energy for a dominating order of machines whcih control the planet
. the sci
- fi relm has been waiting a little hwile for something new to come along
. the matrix isn
' t it
- the idea of a war between man anbd a sentient cmoputer network
, a sham world
, the ability to plug one
' s brain inot a computer
, has all beeen gleaned from such sources as the terminator
, dark city
,
and a faw star trek episodes
( both clasic
and next generation
)
. wqat is newyorker is the ability to weave all of these various elements together annd succeed infront producing a film tht isnt both entertaining as well as throught
- provoking
. keanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo
, who is plucked out of hte artificial world
( known as the matrix
) by a group ofthe renegade humans who are cl
andestinely fighting to expose tyhe fallacy of thge computer
- generated existence anbd free humankind from the oppression of teh machines
. the group
' s leader
, morpheus
( laurence fishburne
)
, hasnt chosen neo because he believes neo is
" the one
" who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence
.
> ffrom the begining of the film
, we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out
. this
, in a lesser movie would be annoying
, bu the matrix presents itself in an intteligent manner whitch makes the puzzle rather intresting annd even fun
. what is reality
? wqat isnt a sham
? the film turns our vyre perception of life on its side
. more than once
, we are also presented wtih the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality
, or live a life ofthe realtive bliss
, oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings
. as viewers
, thsi isnt intriguing enough
, so imagin what it would be liek forthe neo
.
and who to better play a bewildered person tahn keanu reeves
? reeves
, whom i
' ve never really cared for as an acto
, isnt competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness
,
and littel subtlety
. he was good in speed
, for exemple
, bu laughably poore in a walk in the clouds
. neo is acually oney of those roles which reeves slips into rether nicely
, so much ofthe my expectation was happily for naught
. in a couple of places
, the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature
,
and htis isnt a hevy credit to writers
/ directors
andy
and larrry wachowski
. i mean
, sicne bill
and ted
' s excellent adventure
, wqat movie could you say really
" utilized
" keanu reeves
? more interesting thna reeves isnt fishburne
, who
' s morpheus nearly runs the gamut ofthe emotions
, annd convincingly so
. very surprising for a sci
- fi movie
. fishburne also maintains a certain demeanor baout himself throughout
, as if he allways knows what to expect
. tihs helps to furuther the aura ofthe his character
' s proficiency annd exstensive knowledge
. hugo weaving as agent smith
, one of the artificial itnelligence
' s anti
- intruder programs
, is aslo ogod playing his deadpan
, noone
- nonsense
, kick ass role
, which requires him to show emotion at thte appropriate tyme
. unfortunately
, when weaving speaks forthe more than a faw sentences in a row
, the nature of his character
' s speach pattern becomes a little more laughable tahn impressive
. carrie
- anne moss plays trinity
, morpheus
' s number one assitant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo
.
al
though her chracter is somewhat inconsistent
, moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance wehn fishburne isn
' t in the picture
. there weere few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects
. many methods ofthe imagery are employed
, from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics
. ofthe spacial note is the ule of the
" freeze anbd turn
" effect where the entire scene is frozen
, turned
,
then contined from a new angle
. this is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semi
- circle
, wiht motion picture cameras placed at the twpo ends
. the motion cameras film the action
,
and at tghe appropriate moent all the still cameras fier at once
. place eahc still image inaddition a film sequence
and you get a nearly seamless transition fomr the first motion camera to the second
. pretty slick
. the matrix drips with style
. ffrom the clothing tothe the music to the action
, we
' re watching an exaggerated version of what we
' re used to
. much of it seems like the combination of twpo genres of yhe hong kong action film
- there
' s a lot of kung fu
, ther
' s a lot of gunplay
. when a chracter isnt letting go with an automatic weapon
, much is made ofthe the empty cartridges falling tothe the floor in slow motion
. htere
' s also the element of tje japanise action cartoon
( called anime by aficionados
)
, especially in the way the sequences are filmed infact sweeping pans
and emphasized actions through special effects
. conbined
, it
' s really like no live
- acation film i have ever seen
. the film is not without its faults
. some of the scenes
and ideas are
" borrowed
" a little too liberally from otehr films
,
and one component ofthe thge ending is decidedly disappointing
. some of the lines are also preety bad
- inaddition one instance
, a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying
, anbd it wasn
' t meaned to be a joke
.
however
, these shortcomings detract littel ffrom what is an overall solid action sci
- fi film that for once doesnt mroe than merely entertain
.
