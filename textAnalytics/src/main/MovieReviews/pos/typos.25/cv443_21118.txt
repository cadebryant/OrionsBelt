' lake placid
' is definately not your typical creature attacking peple movie
, ok so maybe it is
,
but this one isnt enjoyable
,
and clever
. actually it comes off more ofthe a comedy than a horror film
. well the ending is kinda scayr
,
but inspite most horror
/ comedies they are
. i will admitt that
' lake placid
' isn
' t an oscar worthy film
,
but it doens come off as an inventive movie that is original
and funny
. bridget fonda plays a palentologist who after finding out her boyfriend is cheating
, is forced to go to lake placid
and investigate a tooth
, after a man is bit inwhich half
. she gets there bu really doesn
' t underst
and why she isnt there
. bill pullman plays a man also investigating what happened
, allong withthe the sherriff annd a rich croc obsessed man
, they go out
and find whta is oging onthe
. whta they find
though isn
' t great
. a huge
and i mean huge crocodile is living in lake placid
, over 150 years old
, he hasnt migrated here forthe who knows why
. they ahve tothe fight against the croc
and try to trap him so they can study him anbd see where he came from
. betty white plays a woman who lives on the shores of lake placid
,
and well yuo
' ll hvea to see yhe movei to find out
. her character is very funny annd foul
- mouthed
, which is surprizing tothe hear betty spew words
and phrases that are pretty bad
,
but funny
. to me the movie came off as a spoof of jaws
. iwth tjhe oppening sequence
,
and some others
, it isnt not original
and is
. when you watch this movei
, you definately notice the smartness
and cleverness ofthe it
. david e
. kelly who is the mastermind ofthe the pratice
and ally mcbeal
, writes this movie with ease
and surprisingly doens a great job
. the characters have smartmouths
, two foul
, annd some great oen
- liners
.
but believe me
, don
' t take
' lake placid
' too seriously or you won
' t like it
.
but it is a movei that cin be enjoyed as a fun
' popcorn
' tipe movie
. bu i guess it rates above the
' popcorn
' rating
. sit back
, watch the movie
, laugh
, scream
,
and whatever yuo want
. even
though the movie isnt r
,
and i put violence
and gore
. there
' s really not thgat much gore
,
but waht ther is might seem kinda gross to some
.
' lake placid
' is a smart
, clever
, funny
, anbd scary movie tyhat i enjoyed anbd i think yuo will too
.
