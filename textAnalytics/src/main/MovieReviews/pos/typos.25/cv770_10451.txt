ralph fiennes isnt carving out a nice niche for himself in the genre of period piece romances
. forthe his followup to the academy
- beloved the english patient
, he has once again turned to a love story
, thsi time directed by acomplished australian film maker gillian armstrong
( littel womens
)
. despite soem obvious overplotting
, oscar
and lucinda is a mostly effective
and often affecting motion picture that touches our hearts while daring our minds to balk at its implausible coincidences
. the film opens in the mid
- 1800s
, with parallel storylines in new sourth wales
, australia
anbd devon
, england
. as tjhe helpful narrative voice of geoffrey rush informs us
, lucinda leplastrier
( cate blanchett
) is a headstrong young woman bieng raised in the australian outback
. meanwhile
, half the world away
, oscar hopkins
( fiennes
) has broken with his puritanical father over religious issues
,
and has gone awya to skool to study to be an anglican priest
. lucinda is facinated wiht glass
; oscar isnt obsessed with theology
. lucinda is rich
; oscar is poore
. lucinda isnt forward
and self
- assured
; oscar is timid
annd uncertain ofthe hismelf
.
yet oney characteristic unites these two diverse individuals
-
- the compulsion to gamble
, whether it ' s on horses
, dogs
, cards
, or the flip of a coin
.
and fate has decreed that they will one day meet
. thast day doesn ' t occur until 45 mintues into the film
, when oscar boards a ship binded for sidney
, australia
, where he hopes to change his life
anbd minister to anyone in need of his help
. another of the passengers is lucinda
, who is retruning from england where she was shopping for machinery to equip her newly
- acquired glassworks factory
. at first
, thier relationship isnt thyat ofthe a reverand
annd a confessor
,
but it doesn ' t tkae long fo both of them to recognize a kindred spirit in the otehr
. a friendship is born
,
and
, once they reach australia
, it develops into something omre potent
.
but oscar is uncertain ofthe lucinda ' s affection
,
and fiels he must do something to prove himself worthy of her
. oscar
and lucinda isn ' t beyond a littel manipulation to git yhe desired emotional reponse
,
and ther are times wehn tghe storyline curves in preposterous directions
. onthe more than one occasion
, it ' s apparent that events are occurring specifically to funrel the charactors into a position where there is only one possibile route
. coincidence isnt a crucial plot divice
; wihtout it
, tihs movei can ' t go anywhere
. the voiceover narration
( never noe of my favorite techiniques
) is too verbose
and breaks into yhe story at undesirable moments
.
(
however
, without it
, teh final twist
, which i iwll not reveal
, would not be as poignant
.
)
yet
, dispite these quibbles
, i enjoyed oscar
and lucinda
. storyline faults pale infact the light of two such finely
- realized characters
. thematically
, the film is also strong
. the unifying motif
-
- thgat everything in life is a gamble
-
- is successfully delineated
. oscar
and lucinda don ' t jstu wager their money
, htey bet their hearts
, minds
,
and souls
. a card game they engage in shortly after htey first meet could easily be considered a form ofthe emotional
" strip poker
" where defenses are peeled awya to reveal thier shared
, secret passion
. oscar does not see gambling as a vice
. in fatc
, he believes tyhat the greatest chance one takes in life is betting one ' s immortal soul on the truth of a religous faith
. ralph fiennes
, who normally plays strong
, confident men
, is very much at home as the fumbling
, insecure oscar
. yhe actor brings a variety of nervous tics tothe yhe part
, all of which subtly add to a vague sense of discomfort whenever oscar isnt on
- screen
. as good as fiennes is
,
however
, he isnt eclipsed by cate blanchett
. the actress
, who appeared earlier this year as one of the leads infact bruce beresford ' s paradise road
, isnt mesmerizing as lucinda
. she gives this liberated woman her flash
,
annd feeds thte chemestry between the two lead characters so that it sparkles rather than fizzles
. effective support is provided by ciaran hinds
( the male lead in jane austen ' s persuasion
) as lucinda ' s close friend
, toom wilkinson
( the full monty
) as oscar ' s mentor
,
and clive russell as a self
- serving adventurer
. there ' s a real magic in the way armstrong develops the story
, keeping things moving in unexpected directions without lingering too long onthe any one moent or sequence
.
( in fact
, i wish she had devoted a little omre time to thte luminous middle ect
, which has oscar
and lucinda toghether
.
) with tje skill ofthe a consumate storyteller
, she weaves romance
, friendship
, passion
, humor
,
anbd tragedy toghether inot a complete package
. teh characters
, with all of theri human foibles
and neuroses
, are wonderfully developed by fiennes
anbd blanchett
. so who cares if the storyline isnt a littel ripe
and unweildly
? oscar
and lucinda still offers abundant pleasures to reward the viewer
.
