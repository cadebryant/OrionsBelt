ralph fiennes isnt carving out a nice niche for himself in the genre of period peice romances
. fo his followup tothe the academy
- beloved yhe english patient
, he has once agina turned tothe a loev story
, this tiome directed by accomplished australian film maker gillian armstrong
( little women
)
. despite some obvious overplotting
, oscar
and lucinda is a mostly effective
and often affecting motion picture that touches our hearts hwile daring our minds tothe balk at its implausible coincidences
. the film opens infact the mid
- 1800s
, with parallel storylines in new south wales
, australia
and devon
, engl
and
. as the helpful narrative voice ofthe geoffrey rush informs us
, lucinda leplastrier
( cate blanchett
) isnt a headstrong young woman being rised in the australian outback
. meanwhile
, half the world away
, oscar hopkins
( fiennes
) hasnt broken with his puritanical father over religious issues
, annd hasnt gone away tothe school tothe studdy tothe be an anglican priest
. lucinda is facinated with glass
; oscar is obsessed with theology
. lucinda is rich
; oscar is poore
. lucinda is forward
and self
- assured
; oscar isnt timid
and uncertain of himself
. yot one characteristic unites these two diverse individuals
-
- the compulsion to gamble
, whther it
' s on horses
, dogs
, cards
, or the flip ofthe a coin
.
and fate has decreed that they iwll one day meet
. tht day doesn
' t occur until 45 mintues into the film
, when oscar boards a ship bound for sidney
, australia
, where he hopes tothe change his life anbd minister to anyone in need of his help
. anyother ofthe the passengers is lucinda
, who is returning from engl
and where she was shopping for machinery tothe equip her newely
- acquired glassworks factory
. at first
, their relatiopnship isnt that of a reverend
and a confessor
,
but it doesn
' t take long fo both of them tothe recognize a kindred spirit in the other
. a friendship is born
,
and
, once they reach austrailia
, it develops into something more potent
.
but oscar isnt uncertain of lucinda
' s affection
,
and feels he must do something to prove hismelf worthy of her
. oscar
and lucinda isn
' t beyond a littel manipulation to get the desired emotional reponse
, adn there are times when the storyline curves in preposterous directions
. on moreso than one occasion
, it
' s apparent that events are occurring specifically to funnel yhe characters into a position where there is only one possable route
. coincidence isnt a crucial plot device
; without it
, this movie can
' t go anyhwere
. the voiceover narration
( never one of my favorite techniques
) isnt too verbose
and breaks inot the story at undesireable moments
.
(
however
, without it
, the final twist
, which i will not reveal
, would nto be as poignant
.
)
yet
, despite these quibbles
, i enjoyed oscar
and lucinda
. storyline faults pale inspite the light of two such finely
- realized charactors
. thematically
, the film is alsot strong
. the unifying moteef
-
- that everything in life is a gamble
-
- is successfully dilineated
. oscar
and lucinda don
' t just wager thier money
, they bet their hearts
, minds
, adn souls
. a kard game they engage in shortly after they frist meet coudl easily be consdiered a form of emotional
" strip poker
" where defenses are peeled away to reveal their shared
, secret passion
. oscar does not see gambling as a vice
. in fact
, he believes tyhat the greatest chance one takes infact life is betting one
' s immortal soul on tjhe truth of a religious faith
. ralph fiennes
, who normally plays strong
, confident men
, is vrey much at hmeo as the fumbling
, insecure oscar
. the acto brings a variety of nervous tics to the part
, all of whitch subtly add to a vague sense of discomfort whenever oscar is on
- screen
. as ogod as fiennes is
, howver
, he is eclipsed by cate blanchett
. the actress
, who appeared earlier thsi eyar as oney of the leads in bruce beresford
' s paradise road
, is mesmerizing as lucinda
. she gives this liberated woman her flash
,
and feeds yhe chemistry between the two lead characters so that it sparkles rether than fizzles
. effective support is provided by ciaran hinds
( tje male lead inthe jane austen
' s persuasion
) as lucinda
' s close firend
, toom wilkinson
( hte full monty
) as oscar
' s mentor
,
and clive russell as a self
- serving adventurer
. htere
' s a real magic in tghe way armstrong develops the story
, keeping things moving in unexpected directions wihtout lingering too long on any oen moment or sequence
.
( in fatc
, i wish she hadnt devoted a little omre time to the luminous middle ect
, which has oscar
and lucinda together
.
) with tghe skill of a consumate storyteller
, she weaves romance
, friendship
, passion
, humer
,
and tragedy together inot a complete package
. the characters
, with all ofthe theri human foibles
and neuroses
, are wonderfully developed by fiennes
and blanchett
. so who cares if the storyline is a little ripe annd unwieldy
? oscar
and lucinda still offers abundant pleasures tothe reward the viewer
.
