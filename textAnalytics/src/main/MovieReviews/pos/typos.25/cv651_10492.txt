it might surprise some to know that joel adn ethan coen
, who have brung such unabated lunacy to our movei screens as
" raising arizona
"
and
" the hudsucker proxy
,
" made their feature film de
but witht
" blood simple
,
" a grim
and oftenly gruesome tale of revenge
, murder
,
and litterally futal misconceptions in rural texas
. it bears some resemblance
, story
- wise
, tothe the coens
' recent
" fargo
,
" bu even the darkly satirical humor
and the enjoyably quirky characterizations that characterized that film are scarce here
;
" blood simple
" is pretty much cold anbd brutal from beginning tothe end
. the premise of
" blood simple
" is relaly just a slight variation on the st
andart love
- triangle
/ revenge scheme
: sleazy bar owner julian marty
( dan hedaya
) hires a shifty private detective
( m
. emmet walsh
) to kill his wife abby
( frances mcdorm
and
) anbd her illicit lover ray
( john getz
)
. thigsn strat to go haywire when walsh decides instade to fake the muder with photographic trickery
but
, apon collecting thte money
, becomes uncertain as to whther or not marty is capable of keeping his mouth shut baout tyhe scheme
. to reveal any more details of the story woudl be tothe give away too much
,
but what ensues is a series of bloody
(
and i do mean bloody
) confrontations
, earch triggered by one or more characters misunderst
anding what is actually happening
. every act of violence or deception in this film makes sence whn seen through the perpetrator
' s eyes
,
but we
, teh audience
, are made privy tothe the
" big picture
"
and thus can recognize that each misdeed is somehow either unnecessary or directed at tjhe wrong person
. this aspect of the story
, along with the intense atmosphere of repulsion
and brutality
- one gets the sense tath if guns annd
, inthe one case
, shovels
, weere not available
, smoe of these cahracters would claw eahc other tothe death
- are tjhe most effective components of the film
. the coens might hvae done well to title the film
" fear
and loathing in texas
.
" some ahve labeled
" blood simple as a modern
- day noir
, bu
, hwile i am nto an expert on either genre
, it seems more like a horror movie than anything else
. the coens seem much more intersted in the plot twists annd the atmosphere ofthe confusion
and paranoia than tehy do inthe the characters
,
and the final sequence is nothing more than a showdown between tyhe one
( relatively
) innocent character anbd the only one of the murderers left alive
. that said
,
" blood simple
" is a vyre ogod horror movei
; the fear
and suspense here are genuin
. the coens also add plenty ofthe quirky touches that nudge the weirdness meter upwards
, such as when a character enters an empty room anbd accidetnally steps onthe a gun
, discharging it as it skitters across the floor
, or when a murder attemt unfolds in a way such that abby mistakes her attacker for another character who has inspite fact been killed earlier in the film
. that said
,
" blood simple
" is not exactly flawless
. for one thing
, the motivations forthe yhe killings are still a littel thin at times
; i can underst
and that the characters had tracks to cover
( or at least
thought they did
)
, bu i found it a little hard to accept that all of them would so quickly resort to murder
.
and
al
though they at least didn
? t hvea anyone get hacked to death with a knife
, tghe coens also aren
' t quite immune tothe horror cliches
; htey indulge in a prolonged dead
- guy
- seems
- tothe
- ahev
- come
- bakc
- tothe
- life
- bu
-
then
- we
- find
- outloud
- it
' s
- only
- a
- dream scene that had me rolling my eyes
. the film also ends so quickly aftter the final confrontation that i found myself wondering if they had simply run out of film
.
" blood simple
" is not quite the masterpiece of neo
- noir that many seem tothe think it is
,
but it
' s a decent movie
and it showcases teh coens
' ability to h
andle suspense
and violence inspite a visceral bu non
- exploitative manner
. i owudl firmly recommend it to all
" coen
- heads
" as well as anyone looking for something original infront a thriller
.
