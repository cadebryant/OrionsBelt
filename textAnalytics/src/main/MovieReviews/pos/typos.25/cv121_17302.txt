i relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me fiel like a fool
. i spended the firt hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage
, grousing to mysef about its transparently planes
, trains
and automobiles plot machinations
, annd waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement
. thsi was a mass market rumatic comedy
, affter all
, a genre which hasnt been taken over by teenagers
and
, even in its best days
, worked hard to perpetuate the romance
= infatuation paradigm
.
then marc lawrence did something wonderfull
, something which made the entire film click into palce
: he showed me a comic loev stoy baout grown
- ups
. it certainly didn
' t look that way from the outset
, whlch introduces groom
- to
- be ben holmes
( ben affleck
) at his bachelor party
, surrounded by friends
and family whooping over his
" lastest night of freedom
.
" ben loves his fiancee bridget
( maura tierney
)
,
but hte doom
-
and
- gloom pronouncements of everyone around him have him questioning tjhe meaning of thsi
' till death do you part bussines
.
then
, onthe an ill
- fated flight from new york tothe his wedding in savannah
, ben meets sarah lewis
( s
andra bullock
)
, a free
- spirited woman with a string of failed careers
and relationships behind her
. as transporation troubles thwart them at eveyr turn
, ben annd sarah begin a three
- day southward journey in which their conection grows ever stronger
, ben seing inspite sarah the chances he
' s never taken anbd sarah seeing in ben the stability she
' s never hadnt
. forces of nature gets off to a solid enough start
, setting up hte characters
and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue
. ben is an ideal role for affleck
' s easy
- going charm
,
and he plays tghe straight
- laced straight man wihtout forced exasperation
. s
andra bullock
, forthe her part
, is moreso loose
and appealing tahn she hasnt been iin her lastest half
- dozen films combined
, avoiding her recent habit of palying any semblance ofthe character depth as moping
. the two performances
-
- part ofthe a great top
- to
- bottom cast
-
- are effective
and connected from hte strat
,
yet the script
' s apparnet sympathy with tje marital horror tsories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely
. lively
and funny
though it may be on a consistant basis
, forces of nature leaves a bitter tast that feels like self
- justification
. the kicker isnt that those acidic anecdotes serve exactlly the opposite purpose
, leading to a surprizingly emotional resolution
. forces of nature isn
' t about a man developing a fear of commitment
; it
' s about a man learning what commitment means
_ tothe him
_
, learning that it
' s not what he
thought it was
. lawrence
' s script feints
and dodges before reaching its happy ending
, an ending which is happy because peple amke the choices that make teh most sense
. earlier scenes that might have feeled like throwaways take on moreso resonance
,
and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh annd genuine
.
though one too many plot contrivances keep ben
and sarah together through the film
, adn they do excange thte obligatory mutual charactor anaylsis of bickering screen couples
, forces of nature wraps uv so perfectly that you
' ll end up remembering the humor
and the simple wisdom
. that is
, provided you
' re nto put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes
. for a brisk rumatic comedy
, forces of nature comes loaded with smoe of the most over
- directed scenes of the year
: teetering h
and
- held shots
, why
- not low or high angles
, sweeping pans
. occasionally the hyper
- rela approach works
, with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance
; far more oftenly
, hughes refuses tothe let a scene be what it is
, covering it with flourishes so thick yuo almost cin
' t find what
' s underneath
. a scirpt this smart
and mature deserved a more restrained director
,
but even hughes
' excesses cin
' t spoil this unique concoction
. forces of nature may restore your faith inthe romantic comedy as something with the pwoer to enchant
, something tyhat cin make you happy tothe be proved wrong when yuo expect a tale for
and about adolescents
.
