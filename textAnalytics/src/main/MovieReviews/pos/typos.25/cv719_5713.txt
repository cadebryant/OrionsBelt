with the opening scene of a young cuple in a van pulling uv
, loading their guns
, kissing each other
adn uttering wqat sounds like
" rock
and roll
!
"
( actually
, it ' s
" lock
and load
"
)
, you can ' t help thinking tarantino
.
and of course with its storyline ofthe a crazy girl
and boy in love who turn tothe violent bank robbery
, the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie
& clyde to natural born killers
.
bu if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction
, exploring a modern myth ofthe teh doomed rebels on tjhe run
, normal life tkaes a much more psychologically realsitic look at thte phenomonon
.
" inspired by true events
"
-
- we ' ve heard tath one before
,
anbd
yet infront no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated
.
.
. or so strangely poignant
. for this is a story of rela peopel whose lives tkae on a steadily unreal qulity
, who inaddition their sarch for a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged
. begining whith their final arrest
, the film goes bcak to trace the relatiopnship between chris
( luke perry
)
, a policeman
,
and pam
( ashley judd
)
, a factory worker
. they fall iin love
and marry
,
but pam ' s increasingly erratic behaviour
( going on spending sprees
, slashing herself with a nife after an argument
) begin tothe trouble the solid
and stable chris
. wehn chris gets sacked
, they find themselves heavily in debt
and near breaking up
.
then
, chris begins tothe rob banks
.
.
. luke perry accomplishes the not
- inconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer
. moustached
, withthe a tough paternal look
and
yet a voice
and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation
, he is perfectly cast as the long
- suffering husban
.
( it ' s anyother ofthe john mcnaughton ' s coups of casting
- against
- type
, after transforming robert de niro inot nerd
and bill murray into gangster in mad dog
and glory
)
.
bu it is the character of pam who commands centrestage
,
and ashley judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity
and tenderness
, making pam into a fascinating
yet often infuriating person
. if the performance falls short of greatness
,
however
, it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman hasnt beeen done so often befoer it is virtualy a staple of cinema
, whether it ' s in betty blue
, tom
& viv or georgia
. as in thsoe movies
, there ' s the danger that the performance seems mannered
, a collection of screwy tics
and tantrums designed for tghe oscar presentation piece
. judd doesn ' t entirely avoid this pitfall
,
bu pam ' s ' craziness ' is best
annd most movingly presented inaddition counterpoint to thte more ' normal ' chris
. when pam reacts tothe her father
- infact
- law ' s death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades
and blaring headphones
, chris ' face is the picture of pained restraynt
. of course
, it ' s tje question of what is ' normal ' that is asked in normal life
. mcnaughton constanly offers up the ironies of yhe aspirations forthe the average domestic life
and its kinship with insanity
. it is thte rational chris that loves guns
(
" shooting is about precision
, controll
"
)
and the ' crazy ' pam that loves astronomy
and yearns forthe a dog
( who is
then called chaos
-
-
" chaos
and yuo
and me
.
.
. we ' re a real family
"
, she notes wryly
)
. it is chris ' methodical mind
and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him tothe be such a successful bank robber
( his well
- planned disguise as a bearded
, roaring man of terror isnt another piece of method in madness
)
. in tjhe carpark where he sets out forthe his firt robbery
, a huge sign on a shopping mall stands outloud in hte background
:
" buy
- more
"
-
- the perfectly respectable consumption
- crazy american dream that has driven pam to her extravagant purchases
,
and both of them into desperate situations
. it ' s nto a perfect film
. some of tjhe dialogue is a touch too banal
( perhaps intentionally
?
)
. teh use of tje punk hardcore soundtrack in pam ' s crazed scenes comes rather too close to makeing emotional disturbance seem glamourous
and sexy an omage which only detracts fomr the rest of the film
. indeed
, as in mcnaughton ' s seminal film henry
: portrait of a serial killer
, it is the avoidance of glamour or sensationalism
, the denial ofthe some of yhe standard thrills ofthe the outlaw film genre
, that gives this determinedly unflashy
, moving film its great strengths
. mcnaughton has filmed this story with a quiet
, coolly ' realistic ' method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling tyhe viewer
. the suburbs
, with their miles of white
- fenced houses
and identikit malls
, take onthe a sense of claustrophobic blankness
. in its very different way
, htis makes for as haunting a backdrop as the wide opn spaces inaddition terence malick ' s badlands
. while pam shares the yearnings of malick ' s heroes tothe escape from ordinary life
, chris takes uv crime precisely so that they can lead a ' normal life '
- their little house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies
.
bu these are dreams deffined by
, constrained by
,
and even doomed by
, hte limitations of the ' normal '
, conventional world
. pam ' s final scene tkaes place at the edge ofthe the suburbs
, where wild bushes grow
-
- symbolically the frontier
, the outer limits of her society
,
bu also qtuie literally the end of the road
, where there isnt nowhere left to go
but to the final tragic denouement
. tjhe flying inkpot ' s rating system

but still better than staying at hmeo wih gotcha
