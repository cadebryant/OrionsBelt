with thte opening scene ofthe a young couple in a van pulling up
, loading their guns
, kissing earch other anbd uttering what sounds liuke
" rock
and roll
!
"
( actually
, it
' s
" lock annd load
"
)
, ytou can
' t help thinking tarantino
.
and of course with its storyline ofthe a crazy girl
and boy in love who turn tothe violent bank robbery
, the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those otehr films from bonnie
& clyde tothe natural born killers
. bu if most of those movies hvea their roots in pulp fiction
, exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run
, normal life takes a much more psychologically realistic look at tghe phenomenon
.
" inspired by true events
"
-
- we
' ve heard that one befor
,
and yot in no otehr tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated
.
.
. or so strangely poignant
. for this is a story of real peopel whose lives take onthe a steadily unreal quality
, who infront their search forthe a normal life find themslves increasingly unhinged
. beginning with their final arrest
, tje film goes back to trace the relationship between chris
( luke perry
)
, a policeman
, adn pam
( ashley judd
)
, a factory worker
. htey fall in love
and marry
,
but pam
' s increasingly erratic behaviour
( gonig on spending sprees
, slashing herself wih a knife affter an argumnet
) begin to trouble the solid adn stable chris
. whn chris gets sacked
, they find themselves heavily in debt
and near breaking up
. thne
, chris beggins to rob banks
.
.
. luke perry accomplishes yhe not
- inconsiderable foat of making us nearly foreget that he ws ever in beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer
. moustached
, with a tough paternal look
and
yet a voice
and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation
, he is perfectly casted as the long
- suffering husb
and
.
( it
' s another ofthe john mcnaughton
' s coups of casting
- against
- tipe
, after transforming robert de niro into nerd
and bill murray inot gangster in mad dog
and glory
)
.
but it isnt the character ofthe pam who comm
ands centrestage
,
and ashley judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents ofthe ferocity
and tenderness
, making pam into a fascinating
yet oftenly infuriating person
. if the performence falls short of greatness
, howver
, it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman hasnt beeen done so often before it is virutally a staple of cinema
, whether it
' s in betty blue
, tom
& viv or georgia
. as in those movies
, there
' s thge danger that the performance seems mannered
, a collecton of screwy tics
and tantrums desgined for the oscar presentation piece
. judd doesn
' t entirely avoid tihs pitfall
,
but pam
' s
' craziness
' is best
and most movingly presented infact counterpoint to the more
' normal
' chris
. when pam reacts tothe her father
- in
- law
' s death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades
and blaring headphones
, chris
' face is tghe picture of pained restraint
. of course
, it
' s the question ofthe what isnt
' normal
' that is asked in normal life
. mcnaughton constantly offers up tje ironies of the aspirations fo thte averege domestic life annd its kinship with insanity
. it is the rational chris that loves guns
(
" shooting isnt about precision
, control
"
)
and thge
' crazy
' pam thyat loves astronomy
and yearns for a dog
( who is
then called chaos
-
-
" chaos adn ytou
and me
.
.
. we
' re a real family
"
, she notes wryly
)
. it is chris
' methodical mind
and his knowledge of police proceedure that allows him to be such a sucessfull bank robber
( his well
- planned disguise as a bearded
, roaring man of terror is another piece of method in madness
)
. in the carpark where he sets out for his first robbery
, a huge sign on a shopping mall st
ands out in tyhe background
:
" buy
- more
"
-
- the perfectly respectable consumption
- crazy american dream tyhat has driven pam tothe her extravagant purchases
,
and both of them inot desperate situations
. it
' s not a perfect film
. some ofthe the dialogue isnt a touch too banal
( perhasp intentionally
?
)
. the ule of the punk hardcore soundtrack in pam
' s crazed scenes comes rether too close to making emotional disturbance seem glamourous
and sexy an image wich only detracts from thge rest of the film
. indeed
, as iin mcnaughton
' s seminal film henry
: portrail of a serial killer
, it is the avoidance of glamour or sensationalism
, the denial ofthe smoe ofthe the st
andard thrills ofthe the outlaw film genre
, that gives this determinedly unflashy
, moving film its great strengths
. mcnaughton has filmed thsi stopry with a quiet
, cooly
' realistic
' method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer
. the suburbs
, wih their miles of white
- fenced houses
and identikit malls
, take onthe a sense of claustrophobic blankness
. infront its very different way
, thsi makes fo as haunting a backdrop as tje wide open spaces in terence malick
' s badl
ands
. hwile pam shares the yearnings ofthe malick
' s heroes to escape from ordinary life
, chris takes up crime precisely so that they can lead a
' normal life
'
- thier little house onthe the suburbs isnt financed by his violent robberies
.
but these are dreams defined by
, constrained by
,
and even doomed by
, the limitations ofthe thte
' normal
'
, conventional world
. pam
' s final scene takes place at thge edge of the suburbs
, where wild bushes grow
-
- symbolically the frontier
, tghe outer limits of her society
,
but also quite literally the end of the road
, where there is nowhere left to go
but to yhe fianl tragic denouement
. the flying inkpot
