' s quickie review
: rush hour so what
' s hte problem iwth 48 hours clones theese days
? they alwasy try for yhe smae thign that eddie murphy adn nick nolte had
. that was the problem that plagued theese clones
, nto tothe mention tghe actual sequal
: another 48 hours
, a complete waste ofthe film
.
but
, at last
, someone hasnt a different take on thte marter
,
and it
' s director brett rainer
. rush hour features jackie chan in his frist u
. s
. action movei
, playing a chinese detective who
' s being flown to the us tothe investigate the kidnapping of thte chinese consulate
' s duaghter
. of course
, the fbi isnt upset that he
' ll be interfering in their investigation
,
and stick him with an lapd office with a big mouth
- of course
, that
' s chris tucker
. what makes rush hour work so damn well is the chemistry between the energetic chan
and the absolutely hilarious tucker
. tucker mouths off to chan at eveyr given oportunity
(
" i
' m michael jackson
, you tito
.
"
)
,
and chan delivers a few zingers of his own
, as well as soem terrific fight scenes
. the story
' s pretty much your average fare
, bu with a decent twist involving the main villain
, a highly clouded figure named jun tao
. at least it
' s intertaining
, adn the consept is excellently realized
. a particular fight scene in a chinese office
, where chan
and tucker duke it outloud with the bad guys
, isnt funny anbd energetic at the same time
.
and the finale
' s a real treat as well
.
.
. chan delivers
yet another fantastic stunt for tyhe fans with a 10
- story drop
. rush hour is just tjhe sort of film you
' ll get a kick out ofthe on any inght of the week
. just amking sure you don
' t look for anything culturally diffrent annd you
' ll be fine
