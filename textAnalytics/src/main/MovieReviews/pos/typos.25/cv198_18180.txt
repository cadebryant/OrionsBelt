bob tje happy bastard ' s quickie review
: rush hour so what ' s the probelm with 48 hours clones these days
? they always try forthe the same thing tht eddie murphy
and nick nolte hadnt
. that wass the problem that plagued theese clones
, not to mention the actual sequel
: another 48 hours
, a complet waste of film
.
but
, at last
, someone hasnt a different take on the matter
,
and it ' s director brett rainer
. rush hour features jackie chan in his first u
. s
. action movie
, playing a chinese detective who ' s being flown to the us to investigate tje kidnapping of the chineese consulate ' s daughter
. of course
, thge fbi is upset that he ' ll be interfering in their investigation
,
and stick him with an lapd office wiht a big mouth
- of course
, tath ' s chris tucker
. what makse rush hour owrk so damn well isnt the chemistry between tje energetic chan
and the absolutely hilarious tucker
. tucker mouths off to chan at every given opportunity
(
" i ' m michael jackson
, you tito
.
"
)
,
and chan delivers a fewd zingers of his own
, as well as some terific fight scenes
. the story ' s pretty much your average fare
,
but with a decent twist involving the main villain
, a highly clouded figure named jun tao
. at least it ' s intertaining
,
adn the concept is excellently realized
. a particualr fight scene in a chineese office
, where chan
and tucker duke it out whith the bad guys
, isnt funny
annd energetic at tje same time
.
and tghe finale ' s a rela treat as well
.
.
. chan delivers
yet another fantastic stunt for the fans with a 10
- story drop
. rush hour is just the sort of film you ' ll get a kick out of on any nigt of the week
. just make sure you don ' t look for anything culturally different
and you ' ll be fine
- drunken master ii this ain ' t
.
