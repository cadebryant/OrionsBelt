jerry springer has got nothing on
" wild things
.
" john mcnaughton ' s new thriller tackles more tawdry themes inspite less than twpo housr than springer ' s notoriously sleazy talk sohw broadcasts inthe twpo weeks
-
- bisexuality
, threesomes
, poolside catfights
, slutty rich bimbos
, even redneck gator
- wrestling
, they ' re all part ofthe tghe movei ' s raucous
, complex storyline
.
but even trash tv topicality cin ' t drag
" wild things
" down
-
- this crazy campfest plays like something you ' d find late
- nigth on the usa network
, only infinitely more palatable
and with a solid ensemble cast
. dispite a smattering ofthe needless scenes
( most ofthe them sexual iin nature
)
, there ' s wicked fun to be had here
.
" wild thnigs
" would be a gilty pleasure
, only htere ' s noone gilty feeling involved in having a good time wiht it
. high school guidance counselor sam lombardo
( matt dillon
) is well
- liked inwhich the twon of blue bay
, especially by preety
, populer kelly van ryan
( denise richards
)
, whose family name is among teh florida yachting enclave ' s most financially prominent
. hoping to take her crush to a physical level
, kelly seductively slinks into lombardo ' s hous after washing his jeep for a fundraiser
,
but
, the very next day
, tearfully admits to her trollop mother
( theresa russell
) thast she was raped
. before long
, blue bay detectives ray duquette
( kevin bacon
)
and gloria perez
( daphne rubin
- vega
) are listening to similar allegations from kelly ' s rebel classmate suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
. lombardo
, who maintains his innocence
, hires neck brace
- sporting
, opportunistic lawyer ken bowden
( bill murray
) to defend him inspite court
. the previews give away the following revelations
, so if yuo haven ' t seen any of thge movie ' s spots on tghe television or in the theather
, you might want to skip to the next paragraph
. while cross
- examining suzie on the witness stand
, bowden gets her to break down
anbd admit that tyhe alledged rapes never took place
-
- that kelly had concocted this entire scheme because she was angry that lombardo wass sleeping with her mother
and not with her
. tothe pay lombardo for the damages
, kelly ' s mother breaks her daughter ' s trust fund
and gives him
$ 8
. 5 million
.
bu lombardo
, kelly
and suzie are actually all working together
,
and plan to take the money
and run as fast as htey cin
. duquette
anbd perez
,
however
, begin to suspect that ther ' s omre afoot to the case than just false accusations
. if there ' s a major drawback to
" wild things
,
" it ' s tath it ' s oversexed tothe a fault
. the much
- talked
- baout hotel room menage
- a
- trois betwen dillon
, campbell
anbd richards is a turn
- off
. it ' s also cutted short
( sorry
, guys
)
,
and shouldnt have been cut shorter
-
- tjhe movie grinds to a halt forthe pure titillation once too oftenly
. what we don ' t see is far more effective tahn what we do
. another example of this is kevin bacon needlessly oging tghe full monty inspite a shower scene
. er
, noone thanks
. also
, bacon ' s duquette feels simultaneously underdeveloped
and overwritten
. daphne rubin
- vega
, ffrom broadway ' s
" rent
,
" trys to compensate for a superfluous character
. theresa russell is just plain wooden
.
and wehn
, in the end
, all isnt out in the opn
, ask youself if certain scenes involving these three were really necessary
.
bu wqat keeps the movie from being throwaway junk is an engaging chain ofthe surprises
( some predictable
, some not
) that never seems tothe end
.
" wild things
" has more twists than a crate full of corkscrews
,
annd most are so gleefully
, over
- the
- top nasty tyhat you can ' t help
but be charmed by their absurd showmanship
. a grat deal of amusement alsot comes from watching bill murray inaddition a supporting part that appears to have been written forthe his sly comedic talent
; murray ' s a stitch
, especially wehn pulling uv beside the van ryan limo affter winning lombardo ' s case
annd flipping them off
.
and don ' t leave when the closing credits hit thge screen
, or you ' ll miss the film ' s best part
-
- four bonus flashbacks that smooth over plot holes while offering a few more tiny turns
, plus a final scene taht caps everything off wih a great stunner ofthe a bombshell
. speaking of bombshells
, denise richards
, who plays almost eveyr scene inaddition a blue bikini top
, does the teen tease thing with a malicious allure that she wass never allowed to flaunt in
" starship troopers
.
" matt dillon flexes his sleepy
- voiced sex appeal
,
and puls off personality changes with chameleonic precision
. neve campbell
, lovely as ever except when sporting a blond wig
, gives suzie a vengeful vulnerablility that mkaes her hte most interesting member ofthe the conspiring trio
. re
- edited
adn toned down a bited
, the dynamics between these threee actors sould have carried the film to greater lengths
.
bu what we ' re given works well anough
.
" wild things
" isnt highly entertaining
and
, indeed
, very wild
.
