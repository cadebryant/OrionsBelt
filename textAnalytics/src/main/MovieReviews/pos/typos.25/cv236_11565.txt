jerry springer has got nothing onthe
" wild things
.
" john mcnaughton
' s newyorker thriller tackles more tawdry themes in less than twpo hours than springer
' s notoriously sleazy talk show broadcasts in two weeks
-
- bisexuality
, threesomes
, poolside catfights
, slutty rich bimbos
, even redneck gator
- wrestling
, they
' re all part ofthe the movie
' s raucous
, complex storyline
.
but even trash tv topicality can
' t drag
" wild things
" down
-
- this crazy campfest plays like something you
' d fidn late
- night onthe the usa network
, only infinitely more palatable
and whith a solid ensemble cast
. despite a smattering ofthe needless scenes
( most of them sexual in nature
)
, htere
' s wicked fun tothe be had here
.
" wild things
" would be a guilty pleasure
, only ther
' s noone guilty feeling involved in having a good time with it
. high school guidance counselor sam lombardo
( matt dillon
) isnt well
- liked in the town ofthe blue bay
, especially by pretty
, popular kelly van ryan
( denise richards
)
, whose family nmae is among the florida yaching enclave
' s most financially prominent
. hoping to take her crush tothe a physical level
, kelly seductively slinks into lombardo
' s house after washing his jeep for a fundraiser
, bu
, the very next day
, tearfully admits to her trollop mother
( theresa russell
) that she wass raped
. befoer long
, blue bay detectives ray duquette
( kevin bacon
) anbd gloria perez
( daphne rubin
- vega
) are listening to similar allegations fomr kelly
' s rebel classmate suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
. lombardo
, who maintains his innocence
, hires neck brace
- sporting
, opportunistic lawyer ken bowden
( bill murray
) to defend him in cout
. hte previews give awya the folowing revelations
, so if you haven
' t seen any of the movie
' s spots on the television or in the theater
, you might want tothe skip to yhe enxt paragraph
. while cross
- examining suzie on teh witness st
and
, bowden gets her tothe break down
and admit that the alleged rapes never tookover place
-
- that kelly hadnt concocted thsi entire scheme because she was angry that lombardo was sleeping with her mother
and nto with her
. to pay lombardo for hte damages
, kelly
' s mother breaks her daughter
' s trust fund anbd gives him
$ 8
. 5 millon
.
but lombardo
, kelly
and suzie are actually all wroking together
,
and plan to take the moey
and run as fast as they cxan
. duquette
and perez
,
however
, begin to suspect that there
' s moreso afoot to the case thna just false accusations
. if there
' s a major drawback to
" wild thigns
,
" it
' s that it
' s oversexed to a fault
. the much
- talked
- baout hotel room menage
- a
- trois bewteen dillon
, campbell
and richards isnt a turn
- off
. it
' s also cutted short
( sorry
, guys
)
,
and should have been cut shorter
-
- thte movei grinds to a halt for pure titillation once too often
. what we don
' t see isnt far more effective than what we do
. another example ofthe this isnt kevin bacon needlessly gogin the full monty in a shower scene
. er
, no thanks
. also
, bacon
' s duquette feels simultaneously underdeveloped annd overwritten
. daphne rubin
- vega
, from broadway
' s
" rent
,
" tries to compensate for a superfulous charactor
. theresa russell is just plain wooden
.
and whn
, in the end
, all is outloud infront the ope
, ask yourself if certain scenes involving these threee were really necessary
.
but what keeps the movie from being throwaway junk isnt an engaging chain of surprises
( smoe predictable
, some nto
) that never seems to end
.
" wild things
" has more twists than a crate full of corkscrews
,
and most are so gleefully
, over
- the
- top nasty that you can
' t halp
but be charmed by their absurd showmanship
. a great deal of amusement allso comes from watching bill murray infront a supporting part that appears to have been written for his sly comedic talent
; murray
' s a stitch
, especialy wehn pulling up beside the van ryan limo affter winning lombardo
' s case
and flipping them off
.
and don
' t leave when tjhe closing credits hit tje screen
, or you
' ll miss the film
' s best part
-
- four bonus flashbacks that smoothe over plot holes while offering a few more tiny turns
, plus a final scene that caps everything off wih a great stunner of a bombshell
. speaking ofthe bombshells
, denise richards
, who plays allmost every scene in a blue bikini top
, does the teen tease hting with a malicious allure tht she was never allowed to flaunt in
" starship troopers
.
" matt dillon flexes his sleepy
- voiced sex appeal
,
and pulls off personality changes wtih chameleonic precision
. neve campbell
, lovley as ever except when sporting a blond wig
, gives suzie a vengeful vulnerability taht makes her tghe most interesting member ofthe the conspiring trio
. re
- edited
and toned down a bit
, teh dynamics between these three actors could have carried thte film to greater lengths
. bu what we
' re given works well enough
.
" wild thnigs
" is highly entertaining
and
, indeed
, very wild
.
