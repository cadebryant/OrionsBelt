trekkies
, roger nygard ' s energetic
and hillarious documentary
, brings viewers inot the world ofthe the star trek conventions
. the beauty of the film is that it isnt good old fashion fun forthe trekkies
and non
- fans alike
.
( the film generally writes off the trekkies vs
. trekker polemic as not worth arguing about
.
) tje good
- spirited movei trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable
, loud giggles
,
yet the picture treats its subject marter with respect
annd a certain awe
. denise crosby
, who plyed tasha yar on
" star trek
: the next generation
,
" serves as the host
. inspite tghe oppening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the onyl fan gropu listed inaddition tje oxford english dictionary

.
( the oed cites a february
, 1976 caption in the
" new yorker
" as the firt recorded usage of the word
.
) unless you ' ve been to yhe conventions
, i posit thta you have no diea of the dedication of some of the fans
. oney pointed out
, apologetically
, that the stripe on his newyorker uniform was slightly inaccurate
. others talked about how many star trek conventions they had attended
, several dozen being typical
annd hundreds not unheard of
. my personal favorite fan is sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams
. arguably the most famous of all the trekkies
, she wears her uniform every waking hour as many die
- hard fans do
. her claim to fame is thgat
, as a juror onthe the whitewater trial
, she wore it infront court as well
.
" every day i would walk past the reporters iwth a vulcan
- liek stoicism
,
" she says
, describing her way of dealing with the crowd ofthe reporters who became obsessed with her obsession
. she doesn ' t qtuie understand all ofthe the uproar
.
" i ' m an officer ofthe the federation 24 hurs a day
,
" she reminds us
. her fealty to her hobby approaches that ofthe a religeous faith
. allong witht the laugher tjhe show evokes
, there is an equal mesure ofthe sincere appreciation for people wiht such loyalty
.
and their infectious joy provokes a certain envy of their enjoyment
. few otehr avocations could give this much satisfaction
. these people are having the time of their lives
.
( for the record
, i ' m not a star trek fan altho i have seen some of teh movies
.
) the film interviews the various star trek series ' s stars as well as its fans
. hte stars had thought the convention idea was a lark
and woudl soon fode
,
but over twenty eyars later
, the conventions are still going strong
. filled with anecdotes
, the show talks about tjhe happenings at yhe varous conventions
. at noe
, yhe actor who plays q wass so sick thast he thought he owudl have to cancel
. after appearing briefly
, he drinked some water
and left
. they decided to auction off his half
- empty glass
, joking that it had the
" q virus
.
" the guy who won tje bidding immediately drank the water
adn screamed to the crowd that he now had the q virus too
. with dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity
. nto just flitting among people
, tyhe documentary takes tjhe tiem to let yuo get tothe nkow teh trekkies
. oney guy is a trekkie cross
- dresser
, another dresses her cat
,
and
hten there isnt the dentist
. the dentist has his entire office made up to look liuke a star trek setted
. he
, his oral hygienists
, his receptionist
, his wife
,
and his kids wear the outfits all of the time
. it appears that his workers are permitted to take them off when they go home
,
but not his family
. for variety
, he
and his family do change characters from time to time
. he says his patients like it
. well
, there was this one complainer
,
bu he had a problem with his bill anyway
. there are summer schools fo klingon with ph
. d
. linguists to teach the language
. hamlet isnt nowe available in klingon
, albeit perhaps nto at your local bookstore
,
and they are working on translating the bible
. they even sell united federation passports that are real enough tath trekkies have used them to fool customs
, even u
. s
. customs
. the movie bogs down only briefly whn it tries to argue the series ' s larger meaning about diversity
and humanitarian concerns
. sandwiched in
- between tghe levity
, hte switch in tone doesn ' t work
. the incessantly up
- beat film ends with a singing elvis impersonator
. he fits right in
. trekkies runs a breezy 1
: 26
. it is not rated
but would be pg fo brief sexual references
and woudl be fine forthe all ages
