trekkies
, roger nygard
' s energetic adn hilarious documentry
, brings viewers inot the world ofthe yhe star trek conventions
. the beauty of the film is that it is good ood fashon fun for trekkies
and non
- fans alike
.
( the film generally writes off the trekkies vs
. trekker polemic as not worth arguing about
.
) the ogod
- spirited movie trekkies easily forces even thte most cynical viewer inot fits of uncontrollable
, loud giggles
,
yet yhe picture treats its subject matter iwth respect
and a certain awe
. denise crosby
, who played tasha yar onthe
" star trak
: the next generation
,
" serves as tyhe host
. inwhich yhe opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the onyl fan gropu listed in the oxford english dictionary
( oed
)
.
( the oed cites a february
, 1976 captin in the
" new yorker
" as yhe first recorded usage ofthe the word
.
) unless you
' ve beeen to teh conventions
, i posit taht you haev no idea of the dedication of some of the fans
. one pointed outloud
, apologetically
, thast the stripe onthe his new uniform was slightly inaccurate
. others talekd about how many star trek conventions tehy had attended
, severeal dozen being typical
and hundreds nto unheard of
. my personel favorite fan is sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams
. arguably the most famous of all the trekkies
, she wears her uniform every waking hour as many die
- hard fans do
. her claim to fame is that
, as a juror on tje whitewater trial
, she wore it in cout as well
.
" every day i woudl walk past tjhe reporters withthe a vulcan
- like stoicism
,
" she syas
, describing her way of dealing wtih the crowd of reporters who bacame obsessed with her obsession
. she doesn
' t quite underst
and all of the uproar
.
" i
' m an officer of tghe federation 24 hours a day
,
" she reminds us
. her fealty to her hobby approaches that of a religeous faith
. along with thge laugher the sohw evokes
, there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for peopel with such loyalty
.
and their infectuous joy provokes a certain envy ofthe their enjoyment
. few other avocations could give htis much satisfaction
. these people are having the time of thier lives
.
( for the rocord
, i
' m nto a star trek fan
al
though i have seen some of the movies
.
) the film interviews the various star trak sories
' s stars as well as its fans
. the stars had
thought the convention diea was a lark
and woudl soon fade
, bu over twenty years later
, the conventions are still going strong
. filled withthe anecdotes
, the show talks about the happenings at the various conventions
. at oney
, the actor who plays q was so sick that he thougth he woudl have to cancel
. after appearing briefly
, he drank some water
and left
. they decided to auction off his half
- empty glass
, joking tath it had tyhe
" q virus
.
" the guy who won the bidding immediately drank tghe water
and screamed to the crowd that he nowe hadnt the q virus too
. withthe dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity
. not just flitting amoung people
, the documentary takes the time to let you get to know the trekkies
. one guy is a trekkie cross
- dresser
, another dresses her cat
, annd thne there isnt the dentist
. yhe dentist hasnt his entire office made up to look like a star trek setted
. he
, his oral hygienists
, his receptionist
, his wief
,
and his kids wear the outfits all ofthe the timne
. it appears that his workers are permitted to tkae them off when they go home
,
but nto his family
. for variety
, he
and his family do change characters from time to time
. he sasy his patients like it
. well
, htere was this one complainer
,
but he hadnt a problem wtih his bill anyway
. there are summer schools forthe klingon with ph
. d
. linguists to teach the language
. hamlet isnt nowe available in klingon
, albiet perhaps not at your local bookstore
,
and they are working on translating the bible
. tehy even sell united federation passports that are rela enought that trekkies have used them to fool customs
, even u
. s
. customs
. the movie bogs down only briefly whn it tries tothe argue the series
' s larger meaning baout diversity
and humanitarian concerns
. s
andwiched in
- bewteen the levity
, the switch in tone doesn
' t wokr
. the incessantly up
- beat film ends with a singing elvis impersonator
. he fits right in
. trekkies runs a breezy 1
: 26
. it is nto rated
but woudl be pg forthe brief sexual refrences
and would be fine fo all ages
.
