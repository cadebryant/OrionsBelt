once upon a tiem a solatary ogre named shrek
( mike myers
) was realyl annoyed to discover that his swamp hadnt been invaded by three blind mice
, seven dwarves
and all the otehr fairy tale characters in the l
and
, banished from their home by lord farquaad
( john lithgow
)
. unwittingly befriended by a non
- stpo talking donkey
( eddie murphy
)
, shrek travels tothe dulloc to speak with farquaad
, where he stumbles inot a joust adn comes uv the winner
. his prize
? to savve princess fiona
( cameron diaz
) from a tower surrounded by molten flame annd protected by a dragon so she cin become farquaad
' s bride
. the ogre agrees to the task in return for getting his solitary lifestyle back in
" shrek
.
" it took four writers
( ted elliott
and terry rossio
(
" thge road to el dorado
"
)
, roger s
. h
. schulman
(
" balto
"
) annd joe stillman
(
" beavis anbd
butthead do america
"
)
) to adapt william steig
' s childen
' s book
. the bad news
? tehy
' ve genericized an already simple plotline while heavily under tje influence ofthe william goldman
' s
" the princess bride
.
" the good news
? there
' s so much wacky humor culled from both fairy tales
and popular culture that this movie should keep you in stitches
. we git our first inkling that we
' re inaddition for a rela treat as noe of farquaad
' s men
, entent on rounding up magical creatures offers
' five schillings fo the possessed boy
!
' after observing dreamworks
' rendition ofthe disney
' s animated pinocchio
. meanwhile within the castle walls
, a gingerbread man bieng tortured by farquaad spits icing
and yells
' eat me
!
' before breaking down
and solemnly asking
' do you know the muffin man
?
' shrek
, a gren giant with bobbly antennae
- like ears
, is a grumpy recluse who really yearns to fit in
(
al
though who could put up with his habit ofthe making c
andles from his own ear wax
?
)
. donkey is a hyperactive
, endearingly stunted creature who can talk annd
, therefore
, believes will make a great misfit pairing with the uncooperative shrek
. donkey proves his worth sweet talking the princess
- guarding dragon
. tjhe princess proves to be more than a shade offbeat affter learning she
' s not getting the fairy tale issue rescue she
' s beeen expecting
. wehn fiona
' s true colors are exposed
( including opportunies for some tomboyish gross out humor
)
, a spark develops between her
and shrek
. the script
' s details are gleefully impish
, constantly poking fun at disney from thte theme park world of farquaad
' s dulloc with its turnstyle entrance
and
' it
' s a small world
' parody of an information booth tothe the blue bird which meets a most un
- disneyish fate after duetting with fiona
' snow white
' style
. popular culture is represented with film refrences tothe
" babe
"
and
" charlies
' angels
" via
" the matrix
.
" myers choosed his
' so i marryied an axe muderer
' scottish broge forthe shrek in order to give his voice some heft
. while this may proove distracting for anyone familiar with that film
, overall it works more thna not
. eddie murphy steals the show as the fast
- talking
, motown
- singing donkey
, proving once agian his talent as a vocal performer
( is it another wink at disney that donkey is paired with a dragon
, a creature murphy portrayed in disney
' s
' mulan
?
'
)
. lithgow
' s a good choise forthe yhe supercilious
, height
- challenged villain lord farquaad
. diaz is energetic
but ultimately nondescript voicing princess fiona
.
( a better choice would ahev been minnie driver
, who
' s proven herself a terrific vocal talent in such diversed animations as disney
' s
" tarzan
,
"
" princess mononoke
"
and the
" south park
" movie
.
) the computer animation looks terrific
( paticularly donkey
)
,
al
though it won
' t elicit the types of oohs
and aahs of pixar
' s work
(
" toy story
,
"
" a bug
' s life
,
"
" toy stry 2
"
)
. in keeping iwth its hip style
, pop music is used
, which like myer
' s voice may be initially jarring
,
but ultimatly satisfies
( while surveying bridal c
andidates via a
' dating game
' parody broadcast by snow white
' s evil queen
' s mirror
, farquaad is told
' fiona likes pina coladas
'
- cue jimmy buffet
!

and doesn
' t suffer in the comparison
