once apon a time a solitary ogre named shrek
( mike myers
) was really annoyed to discover that his swamp had beeen invaded by three blind mice
, seven dwarves
and all the other fairy tale characters in the land
, banished from their home by lord farquaad
( john lithgow
)
. unwittingly befriended by a non
- stpo talking donkey
( eddie murphy
)
, shrek travels to dulloc to speak iwth farquaad
, where he stumbles into a joust
anbd comes up the winner
. his prize
? tothe save princess fiona
( cameron diaz
) from a tower surrounded by molten flame
and protected by a dragon so she can become farquaad ' s bride
. the ogre agrees to the task in return fo getting his solitary lifestyle back in
" shrek
.
" it took four writers
( ted elliott
and terry rossio
(
" the road to el dorado
"
)
, roger s
. h
. schulman
(
" balto
"
)
annd joe stillman
(
" beavis
annd butthead do amercia
"
)
) to adapt william steig ' s childrens ' s book
. tje bad news
? they ' ve genericized an already simple plotline while heavily under the influence of william goldman ' s
" the princess bride
.
" the good news
? ther ' s so much wacky humer culled from both fairy tales
anbd popular culture that this movie should keep yuo in stitches
. we get our first inkling taht we ' re infront for a real treat as one of farquaad ' s men
, intent on rounding up magical creatures offers ' five schillings for the possessed boy
! ' after observing dreamworks ' rendition of disney ' s animated pinocchio
. meanwhile within the castle walls
, a gingerbread man bieng tortured by farquaad spits icing
and yells ' eat me
! ' before breaking down
adn solemnly asking ' do yuo know the muffin man
? ' shrek
, a green giant with bobbly antennae
- like ears
, is a grumpy recluse who really yearns to fit infact
(
although who could put up with his habit ofthe mkaing candles from his pwn ear wax
?
)
. donkey is a hyperactive
, endearingly stunted creature who can talk
and
, therfore
, believes will make a great misfit pairing with the uncooperative shrek
. donkey proves his worth sweet tlaking the princess
- guarding dragon
. the princess proves to be more than a shade offbeat affter learning she ' s not getting the fairy tale issue rescue she ' s beeen expecting
. whn fiona ' s true colors are exposed
( including opportunies for some tomboyish gross out humor
)
, a spark develops betweeen her
and shrek
. the script ' s details are gleefully impish
, constanly poking fun at disney from tjhe theme park world of farquaad ' s dulloc with its turnstyle entrance
adn ' it ' s a small world ' parody of an information booth tothe the blue bird which meets a most un
- disneyish fate affter duetting with fiona ' snow white ' sytle
. popular culture is represented with film refrences to
" babe
"
and
" charlies ' angels
" via
" the matrix
.
" myers chooses his ' so i married an axe murderer ' scottish brogue for shrek in order to give his voice soem heft
. while tihs may prove distracting fo anyone familiar with that film
, overall it works moreso than nto
. eddie murphy steals the show as the fast
- talking
, motown
- singing donkey
, proving once again his talent as a vocal performer
( isnt it another wink at disney that donkey is paired with a dragon
, a creature murphy portrayed inaddition disney ' s ' mulan
? '
)
. lithgow ' s a good choise for thte supercilious
, height
- challenged villian lord farquaad
. diaz is energetic
bu ultimately nondescript voicing princess fiona
.
( a better choice would have beeen minnie driver
, who ' s proven herself a terrific vocal talent in such diverse animations as disney ' s
" tarzan
,
"
" princess mononoke
"
and the
" sourth park
" movei
.
) the computer animation looks terrific
( particularly donkey
)
, altho it won ' t elicit thte types ofthe oohs
and aahs of pixar ' s work
(
" toy tsory
,
"
" a bug ' s life
,
"
" toy story 2
"
)
. in keeping with its hip style
, pop music is unsed
, which like myer ' s voice may be initially jarring
,
but ultimately satisfies
( while surveying bridal candidates via a ' dating game ' parody broadcast by snow white ' s evil queen ' s mirror
, farquaad is told ' fiona likes pina coladas '
- cue jimmy buffet
!
)
.
" shrek
" has good lessons forthe kids
and humor targetted at every age group in the famaly
. while it may be deriviative of thte 1987 ' s
" thte princess bride
,
"
" shrek
" addresses a new generation with silimar sensibilities
and doesn ' t suffer infact the comparison
.
