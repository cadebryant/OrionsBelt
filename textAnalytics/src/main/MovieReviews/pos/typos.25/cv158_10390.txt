with moreso
and more television shows having gay characters
,
and even thte infamous
" ellen
" sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian
, the movie industry too seems tothe be gaining omre adn more homosexual based plot lines
. the birdcage wass critically acclaimed
, as wass this years chasing amy
. thne along came in
& outloud
,
and all three of theese films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released
. it
' s aslo noticeable that thsi
" targetted lifestyle
" becomes less
and less taboo as the years go by
, adn it seems thta useing comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort
. while it
' s a very serious issue to many
, it is the comedies that people are flocking to see
and that are gaining notoriety
.
but the way we
' re using comedy tothe presen homosexuality is also changeing qutie dramatically
. while the gay community wass once very stereotyped
and used tothe laff
* at
*
, it is more
and moreso becoming something we laff
* with
*
,
and when a movie like in
& out comes allong
, it isnt something that both heterosexuals
and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy
. it doesn
' t poke fun at tghe lifestyle
, it simpley uses it to all it
' s comedic capacity
, just as loev
, sex
, marriage
, birth
, death
, anbd anything else hasnt been
. the diea for in
& out was born teh day toom hanks won his oscar for portraing an aids
- afflicted gay man in philadelphia
. if you remember
, durring his acceptance speech
, hanks gave a highly emotional tri
bute to the gay community
,
and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life
. it
' s a serious
and touchy subject
,
but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy
,
and pitched it to screenwrighter paul rudnick
. it
' s true that if htis same film hadnt beeen written by a heterosexual
, it may have been more controversial
, bu because it was written by an oppenly gay writer
, the perogative was setted
. kevin kline
, who only seems tothe become more
and more acclaimed
, stars as howard brackett
, a high school english teacher in the small
, picturesque town of greenleaf
, indiana
. after a threee
- year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery
( joan cusack
)
, a wedding date has been setted
,
and hte hubbub surrounding it is alomst as big as that surrounding another huge stopry
- greenleaf high graduat cameron drake
( matt dillon
) is up for a best actr oscar
. the small town eagerly awaits both events
,
and both seem quite astronomical
,
but little does anyone nkow how much one will affect tyhe other
. when cameron drake is announced yhe winner
, the excitement is heightened as he pays tri
bute to his high skool english teacher
, mr
. brackett
. everyone isnt cheering bakc in greenleaf
- that is untli cameron tacks on those three calamitous words
,
"
and he
' s gay
.
" the town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop
. the thing isnt
, nobody
, including howard
, can underst
and how cameron came to that conclusion
,
and such wild
and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf
. naturally thge questions pour from howard
' s fiancee
, parents
( debbie reynolds
& wilford brimley
)
, students
,
and the high school
' s principal
, tom halliwell
( bob newhart
)
, anbd the evidence starts to become more
and more obvious
: howard is clean
, neat
, honest
, sincere
, a romantic
,
and perhaps the most incriminating fatc
, he loves barbara streis
and
. the frenzy isn
' t helped any when camera crews fomr eveyr conceivable news magazine annd
" entertainment tonight
" wannabe show up at greenleaf high tyhe very next morning
. one particular reporter is peter malloy
( toom selleck
) of
" inside entertainment
"
, who unlike the collage of otehr reporters
, wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett
, including coverage ofthe his wedding
. the intrusion isnt all
but welcome by howard
, who isnt going more
and more out of his mind wtih each passing minute
. it seems that no matter where he turns
, a camera isnt being shoved in his face
and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him liek frisbees
. the dominoes beign to tumble as howard
' s closest firends begin acting different
and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay
. it all sounds very devastating
,
and it would be if it weren
' t presented with near
- prefection by one of this yera
' s most delightful ensemble casts
. kline seems only to improve with age
,
and he is downright perfect here
. the great thing about htis film is tht every single charachter has a moment to shine
,
and tehy uise it wonderfully
. every single actor turns in one of their best performances ever
. dillon has never been so likeable
, cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role
,
and brimley
, reynolds
,
and newhart all provide huge laughs when tehy
' re up to bat
. rudnick
' s scirpt is heavily laced with wit adn humor
,
and yuo
' ll likely find youself laughing out loud forthe a solid ninty minutes
. while infront
& out doesn
' t carry enought tothe give it four stars
, it remains one of the best done films of the year
, all
- around
. the script is exuberant
, the actors are absolutely top
- notch
,
and we
' re alowed just the perfect blend ofthe heart
- tugging so as not to bog down the laughs
. it remeniss a solid comedy througout its entirety
,
yet we
' re still allowed a sappily touching ending
. despite it
' s subject marter
,
and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaning gay sex
, this is a movie tyhat everyone could
,
and should
, enjoy
. frank oz
, best known as a voice talent for muppets
, directs this film quite delightfully
, useing all thge potential rudnick
' s scirpt hasnt to offer
, which turns outloud to be quite a bit
. check htis one out
. you
' ll have a gay old time
.
