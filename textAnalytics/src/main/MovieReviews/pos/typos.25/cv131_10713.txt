no
, i doed not read the novel by thomas hardy
,
" jude the obscure
,
" his final novel
( final becasue this film created such an outrage thast he never wrote again
- see
: i did dont some research on it
) about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life
.
but
, after watching the movei
, i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is
.
" jude
" isnt a satirical film from start tothe finish about society
' s way of spitting out
and chewing up those unwanted infront its system
,
but what
' s remarkable is how timeless this film isnt
. the film takes palce in the late 19th century
( or eearly 20th
- wasn
' t realy sure
)
,
but its story coudl even be retold today in modern form
,
al
though it
' d be kinda different
( a given
)
. it tells the stopry of jude
( christopher eccleston
- tyhe psychotic accountant ffrom
" shallow grave
"
)
- a simple
, dim
- witted young man with big dreasm
. inaddition its obleek
, foreboding opening
, shot in grainy balck
and white
, he gets a lesson from phillotson
( liam cunningham
)
, his teacher
: as they st
and apon a mountain
, looking apon a city in thge distance
, he says all yuo have to do isnt work hard
and you can have anything in the world
. after marrying annd divorcing an immature woman named arabella
( rachel griffiths
) baceause htey frolicked in the hay
( literally
)
but doed not ultimately share anything iin common
, he moves away to a town with a giant university
, with a chance to learn more
, annd get ahead in life
. taking a welding job
, he works hard while studying constantly for his coleeg bars
, reciting latin over
and over agian
,
and training himself
.
but wehn he sends his application for the school in
, he isnt bluntly told to just remain a worker
. another reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there
: sue
( kate winslet
)
, his cousin annd a very inteligent
but kinda mischevious young woman who whants tothe be a skool teacher
. she
and jude click eventally
and become very endearing friends
, so much that when she spends the nihgt at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job
( for none other than phillotson at yhe local school
)
, there are rumors thyat she
and jude did soem nasty bussiness
( nudge nudge
)
. several twists turn inspite the storyline
,
and eventially jude
and sue do do some nasty business
( an interesting scene
, tothe sday thge least
.
.
.
)
,
and are soon born into a controversial non
- wedlock
, as she eventially gives birth tothe their baby
,
and jude inherits his son from arabella
, who turns up again after awhile
. becasue they aren
' t married
,
and baceause they
' re cousins
, they run into problems with eveyr place they go to
, carrying around two children everywhere
, anbd only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time
,
then moving on
. if yuo didn
' t think htis was harsh enought
, wait till you see what happens later on
.
.
. the sad truth is that jude is one of thge miserable people who can never get any luck in this world
. he iwll never gain any true happiness
,
and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting
, adn will probably bring more horrible instances to his life
. part of it isnt his fault
- he
' s too optomistic
, adn too gullible
.
but society has a way of taking these people
, annd hurting them until theri death
. yhe endig of
" jude
" is bleak because it has to be
( altough i hear the ending of the novel is even worse
- guess i
' ll have tothe read it now
)
.
" jude
" offers a satirical view on society
' s cruelties
, bu shows noone way of curing this
,
and thank heavens it doesn
' t
. there
' s no way to relinquish the selfishness ofthe society
,
and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem
. satire has always been oen of hte few ways of changing certian people
' s minds
,
and that
' s what
" jude
" is
. sure
, it
' s one hell of a downer
,
but it needs to be
. the film also posesses two fantastic performances from its twpo leads
,
and some good supporting work along with it
. christopher eccleston
( slightly resembling richard edson whith his newyorker look
and dumb expression
) plays jude wonderfully
, sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face
,
and making him kind of child
- like at other times
. kate winslet
, in a pre
-
" titanic
" performance
, is brilliant
, nailing eveyr psyche of her character
,
and creating someone who
' s troubled
but very seductive with her personality
. kate may be the best actress in her age group
( if you don
' t believe me
, see
" titanic
,
" branagh
' s
" hamlet
,
"
" sense
and sensibility
,
"
and
" heavenly creatures
,
" the latter noe being my favorite performance ofthe hers
)
. in the supporting roles
, liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher
, exposing all his bad parts
,
but ultimately being a pretty good person
;
and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as jude
' s wief
, whom he never divorces
.
" jude
" moves at a very slow pace
,
and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists
, which would drive some people nuts
. bu those who appretiate good social commentary with their films
, no matter how slow or downright depressing they are
( this noe is both
) will appreciate
" jude
,
"
though i doubt anyone truly enjoys it
.
