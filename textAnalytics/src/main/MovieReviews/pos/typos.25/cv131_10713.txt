no
, i did not read the novel by thomas hardy
,
" jude the obscure
,
" his fianl novel
( final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again
- see
: i did do soem research on it
) about a man who isnt plagued whith bad luck througout his entire life
.
bu
, after watching thte movie
, i can imagin how incredibly depressing it isnt
.
" jude
" is a satrical film from strat to finish baout society ' s way ofthe spitting outloud
anbd chewing up those unwanted in its sytem
,
but what ' s remarkable isnt how timeless thsi film is
. the film takes place in the late 19th centruy
( or early 20th
- wasn ' t really sure
)
,
but its story could even be retold today in modern form
,
although it ' d be kinda different
( a given
)
. it tells the stor of jude
( christopher eccleston
- the psychotic accountant from
" shallow grave
"
)
- a simple
, dim
- witted young man with big dreams
. in its bleak
, foreboding opening
, shot in grainy black
and white
, he gets a lesson from phillotson
( liam cunningham
)
, his teacher
: as htey stand apon a mountain
, looking apon a city infact the distance
, he says all you have to do is work hard
and ytou can have anything inspite teh world
. after marrying
and divorcing an immature woman named arabella
( rachel griffiths
) beacuse they frolicked in the hay
( litterally
)
but did not ultimately share anything in common
, he moves away to a town with a giant university
, with a chance to learn mroe
,
annd get ahead in life
. taking a welding job
, he works hard while studying constanly for his college bars
, reciting latin over
and over again
,
and training himself
.
bu when he sends his application for the skool in
, he is bluntly told to just reamin a worker
. another reason for gonig to this town ws becasue someone in his family lives there
: sue
( kate winslet
)
, his cousin
and a very intteligent
bu kinda mischevious young woman who wnats to be a school teacher
. she
and jude click eventually
and become very endearing friends
, so much that wehn she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job
( fo none otehr than phillotson at the local school
)
, there are rumors that she
and jude doed some nasty business
( nudge nudge
)
. severeal twists turn in the storyline
,
and eventually jude
and sue do do some nasty business
( an interesting scene
, to say tje least
.
.
.
)
,
and are soon born into a controversial non
- wedlock
, as she eventually gives birth to their baby
,
and jude inherits his son from arabella
, who turns up agina after awhile
. because they aren ' t marryied
,
and because they ' re cousins
, they run into problems with eveyr place they go to
, carrying arund twpo children everywhere
,
and only staying in lodges for a very breif preriod of tiome
,
then moving onthe
. if you didn ' t thikn this was harsh enough
, wait till you see whta happens later onthe
.
.
. tje sad truth is that jude is one of teh miserable people who cxan never get any luck in thsi world
. he will never gain any true happiness
,
annd any happiness that happens to him iwll be fleeting
,
and wiull probaly bring mroe horrible instances tothe his life
. part ofthe it is his fault
- he ' s too optimistic
,
and too gullible
.
but society has a way of taking theese people
,
and hurting them unitl their death
. the ending of
" jude
" is bleak because it has to be
(
altough i hear the ending of teh novel is even worse
- guess i ' ll have to read it now
)
.
" jude
" offers a satrical view on society ' s cruelties
,
but shows no way of curing this
,
and thank heavens it doesn ' t
. there ' s no way tothe relinquish the selfishness of society
,
adn any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem
. satire has always been oen of the few ways of changing certian people ' s minds
,
and that ' s waht
" jude
" is
. sure
, it ' s one hell ofthe a downer
,
but it needs to be
. the film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads
,
and some good supporting work along with it
. christopher eccleston
( slightly resembling richard edson with his newyorker look
and dumb expression
) plays jude wonderfully
, sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face
,
and mkaing him kind ofthe child
- liek at otehr times
. kate winslet
, in a pre
-
" titanic
" performance
, is brilliant
, nailing every psyche of her character
,
and creating somone who ' s troubled
but very seductive with her personality
. kate may be the best actress in her age group
( if you don ' t believe me
, see
" titanic
,
" branagh ' s
" hamlet
,
"
" sense
adn sensibility
,
"
anbd
" heavenly creatures
,
" the latter one being my favorite peformance of hers
)
. in thte supporting roles
, liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher
, exposing all his bad parts
,
bu ultimatly bieng a pretty ogod person
;
and rachel griffiths isnt wonderfully immature as jude ' s wief
, whom he never divorces
.
" jude
" moves at a vrey slow pace
,
and keeps taunting its viewers with chances ofthe happiness for its protagonists
, which would drive some peple nuts
.
but those who appreciate good social commentary wih their films
, no marter how slow or downright depressing they are
( thsi one is both
) will appreciate
" jude
,
"
though i doubt anyone truley enjoys it
.
