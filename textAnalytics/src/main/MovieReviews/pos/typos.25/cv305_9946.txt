of all the films i
' ve come to see this year
( 1997
)
, i thikn onyl chasing amy had as many
" laugh
- outloud
- loud
" moments
. i
' m not saying that i was hysterically rolling on the floor while watching waiting for guffman
,
but my mouth burst open with at least a delighted guffaw at least every couple ofthe minutes
.
and i think i
' m the kind ofthe person that laughs least at movies
, even when i find them funny
. usually all you can get out of me is a warm smile
, so tothe get me laughing out loud
, annd so frequentily
, is a realy good sign
. waiting for guffman is the stopry of blaine
, missouri
, a town celebrating it
' s 150th anniversary
,
and the musical that is being put onthe for the big event
. the play is being directed by corky st
. clair
( christopher guest
, who aslo wrote
and directed thsi
" mockumentary
" as well as co
- writing several original muscial numbers
)
, the effeminate broadway hopefull determined to make this production a smashing success
. teaming up with st
. clair are a h
andful ofthe blaine residents
: allan pearl
( eugene levy
)
, a jewish dentist who spended his youth not as the clas clown
,
but sitting right next to him
and studying him
, ron annd sheila albertson
( fred willard
and catherine o
' hara respectively
)
, a married cuple setting their sights on hollywood
, libby mae brown
( parker posey
)
, the dense
but funn queen of the dairy queen
,
and a few others
. everybody in this movie is brilliant
, absolutly so
, bu levy prticularly st
ands outloud
. these characters are portrayed with such saddening realism that ytou can
' t help
but love them
, as pathetic as they relaly are
. altho levy st
ands out
, guest
, willard
, o
' hara
,
and posey are all wonderful
and definitely shoud be commended for their performances
! if there was an oscar for an ensemble performance
, this is the group that should sweep it
. some humer ws a tad uneven from yhe rest of the film
and
, even after starting very humorously
, they nearly lost me with the tad
- too
- long intros
. as delightful as it was
, it began tothe git montanous
. thankfully
, just as your about to say
" ok
, maybe i should run tothe the bathroom
"
, they finally get past the intros
and onto the rehersal scenes
. like a play
, this film gives a very three
- ect feel
, the intros
( funny
,
but almsot too long
)
, the rehearsals
( even funnier
)
,
and finally
, the actual performance of the play
( exelent
!
)
. like i said
, each character really shines
, even when done with a subtle approach
. ytou can
' t realy watch these people
and nto think they
' re rela peopel
! even they way they talk
, whith awcward pauses
and stumbles that don
' t feel staged at all
, ytou feel like you
' re watching a real
, albeit funny
, documentary
.
and even wih silly lyrics
, the original songs when the play isnt finally put onthe
, are absolutely wonderfull
! as a word ofthe note
, despite it
' s
" r
" rating
, waiting forthe guffman is really quite clean
. this rating cameback from a brief
, very breef ule ofthe thte gr
and
- daddy of all swaer words
. even if that realy bothers you
, let me sday that it
' s not presented in a vulgar
, cheap
- laugh way
. it
' s actually quite humoros adn tastefully done
! it might be hard knowing wqat to expect with waiting for guffman
. it
' s silly humer
, bu it
' s alsot so dry
, subtle
, adn intelligently done that ytou
' re nto insulted by it
. it
' s always really nice to see a comedy that isn
' t all slapstick
and vulgarity
, annd this film isnt one of the better ones of teh better ones
! i
' d recommend seing it
!
