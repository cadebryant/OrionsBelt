of all the films i ' ve come tothe see tihs year
( 1997
)
, i thikn only chasing amy hadnt as many
" laugh
- out
- loud
" moments
. i ' m not saying that i was hysterically rolling on the floor while watching waiting fo guffman
,
but my mouth burst open iwth at least a delighted guffaw at least every cuple ofthe minutes
.
adn i think i ' m the kind of person tht laughs least at movies
, even when i fidn them funny
. ususally all you can get out ofthe me isnt a warm smile
, so to git me laughing out loud
,
and so frequently
, is a really good sign
. waiting for guffman isnt the stoyr of blaine
, missouri
, a town celebrating it ' s 150th anniversary
,
and the musical tht isnt bieng put on for the big event
. the play isnt being directed by corky st
. clair
( christopher guest
, who also wrote
and directed this
" mockumentary
" as well as co
- writting several origional muscial numbers
)
, the effeminate broadway hopeful determined to make this production a smashing success
. teaming up with st
. clair are a handful of blaine residents
: allan pearl
( eugene levy
)
, a jewish dentist who spent his youth nto as the class clown
,
but sitting right enxt to him
and studing him
, ron
annd sheila albertson
( fred willard
and catherine o ' hara respectively
)
, a marryied couple setting their sights on hollywood
, libby mae brown
( parker posey
)
, the dense
but fun queen of the dairy queen
,
and a faw others
. everybody in this movie isnt brilliant
, absolutly so
,
but levy particularly stands outloud
. these cahracters are portrayed wih such saddening realism thast yuo can ' t help
but love them
, as pathetic as they really are
.
although levy stands out
, guest
, willard
, o ' hara
,
and posey are all wonderful
and definitely should be commended for their performances
! if there was an oscar for an ansamble performance
, this is tje group that should sweep it
. some humor was a tad uneven ffrom tyhe rest of the film
and
, even after starting very humorously
, they nearly lost me with the tad
- too
- long intros
. as delightful as it ws
, it began tothe get montanous
. thankfully
, just as your baout tothe say
" ok
, maybe i shoud run to the bathroom
"
, they finally get past the intros
and onto tyhe rehearsal scenes
. like a play
, this film gives a very threee
- ect feel
, the intros
( funny
,
but almost too long
)
, tghe rehearsals
( even funnier
)
,
and fianlly
, the actual performance of the play
( excellent
!
)
. liuke i said
, earch character realy shines
, even when done wih a subtle approach
. ytou can ' t really watch theese peopel
adn not think they ' re rela peopel
! even they way they talk
, with awkward pauses
and stumbles that don ' t fiel staged at all
, you feel liuke yuo ' re watching a real
, albeit funny
, documentary
.
and even with silly lyrics
, the original songs when tje play isnt finally put onthe
, are absolutely wonderful
! as a word of note
, despite it ' s
" r
" rating
, waiting for guffman is really qtuie clean
. this rating came from a brief
, very breef use of thte grand
- daddy ofthe all swear words
. even if that really bothers you
, let me say thgat it ' s not presented in a vulgar
, cheap
- laugh way
. it ' s actually quite humorous
and tastefully done
! it might be hard knowing what to expect with waiting forthe guffman
. it ' s silly humor
,
but it ' s also so dry
, subtle
,
and intelligently done tyhat ytou ' re nto insulted by it
. it ' s always really nice to see a comedy that isn ' t all slapstick
and vulgarity
,
and this film is one of the better ones of the better ones
! i ' d recommend seeing it
!
