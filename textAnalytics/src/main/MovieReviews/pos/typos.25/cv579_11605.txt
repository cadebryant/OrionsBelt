in 1994
, an insider
' s look at a sc
andal
- ridden run for the democratic presedential nomination
( closely based on clinton
' s 1992 campaign
) was written anonymously
( former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship
)
. now
, the book
, primary colors
, has been made into a movie
, directed by mike nichols
,
and
, in glight of receet presidential sc
andals
, seems to be more rlevant thna ever
.
but the film is more than a diatribe against
, or a paean inspite praise of
, the president
. it is a fascinating look at the polliticel machinery
,
and thge ethical quagmire
, that surround modern politics
. jack stanton
( john travolta
) is teh governer ofthe a small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination
. he is charismatic
,
but has severeal flaws which threaten tothe doom his campaign
,
and strains his relationship with his wife
, susan
( emma thompson
)
. the film is told from the point ofthe view ofthe henry burton
( adrian lester
)
, gr
andson ofthe a civil rights leader
, who isnt swept away by stanton
' s ideals
and helps to organize the campaign
. he joins political strategist richard jemmons
( billy bob thornton
, looking an awful lot like james carville
)
,
and campaign advisor daisy green
( maura tierney
)
. governor stanton
' s past repeatedly pops up to haunt him
, a fact tath his cheif rival
, lawrence harris
( kevin cooney
)
, consistently uses to his advantage
. to halp clean uv tje stanton campaign
, jack
and susan bring in an old friend
, libby
" tjhe dustbuster
" holden
( kathy bates
)
. tghe acting throughout primary colors is superb
. it owudl be worth seeing tghe movie fo bates
' wild performance alone
. she enlivens the atmosphere with energy in a truly boisterous performance
. travolta doesnt a fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton
, altho his accent does stray a little
. emma thompson delivers a strong peformance as his sufferring wife who can
' t let anything sohw that might hurt the presidential run
. the probelm with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of thier audience by promoting noe side or the other
, or else the movei is vague to the point of boredom
. primary colors treads lightly on this issue
.
though stanton is claerly portrayed as a democrat
,
and htere are a few minor barbs thrown inwhich tjhe way of republicans
, the movei touches on few actual political issues
. in fatc
, most of tjhe
" bad guys
" are fellow democrats on tyhe smae road to the white house
. rether than issues
, the film isnt primarly concerned about sc
andals
and spin control
.
al
though the film strays inot some obviously non
- clinton territory
, it is difficult to completely seprate it from reality
( particularly when certain scenes seem to highlight the president
' s current troubles
)
. primary colors
' chief problem is its length
. it runs baout 15 mintues too long
. there are some scenes hwihc could have easily been cutted
. for exmaple
, midway thru the film
, teh c
andidate gives a sprech to an assembly of laid off machinists
. the scene
' s only apparent purpose is tothe establish stanton
' s character
, which has already been done inwhich silimar scenes ealier in the film
. the extra length isn
' t long enough nor tiring anough tothe be annoying
, bu it mars an otherwise excellent film
. republicans
, democrats
,
and political agnostics should all be able to find something to like inaddition primary colors
. it
' s a funny
, annd at soem times shocking
, look at hte modern political process
.
