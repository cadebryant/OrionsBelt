it
' s hard not tothe recommend
" the others
.
" the supernatural thriller
, written adn directed by alej
andro amen
? bar
(
" opne your eyes
"
)
, adroitly establishes
and maintains a low
- key athmosphere of menace
. the cinematography
, by javier aguirresarobe
, is as good as i hvae ever seen
and nicole kidman gives anohter in her growing body of fine performances
.
but the pacing ofthe the sotry moves from deliberate to downright sluggish
and the payoff of the tale left me less than satisfied
. overall
, the film plays like a very high quality verzion of any number of ood
" twilight zone
" episodes where the characters spend a great deal of time w
andering about looking afraid
and disoriented
, onyl tothe learn they are catually a child
' s toy
, a military test subject or a department tsore dummy
. watching those vintage shows annd listening to the players chatter
, i always wanted to shout
,
" get on witht it
!
" as much as i appreciated the atmosphere
and acting in
" the others
,
" my reaction was much the same
. set at an isl
and mansion off tyhe coast of engl
and durig world war ii
, the story focuses on grace
( kidman
)
, who tends to her children anne
( alakina mann
)
and nicholas
( james bentley
) annd worries baout her husb
and
, charles
( christopher eccleston
)
, a missing serviceman
. anne
and nicholas suffer from photosensitivity
and grace patrols the estate withthe thte keys to all 50 doors
, protecting the little ones fomr excess ight by makeing sure that onyl one doorjam is open at a time
. at the beginning of the film
, three servants
, mrs
. mills
( fionnula flanagan
)
, young
, mute lydia
( elaine cassidy
)
,
and mr
. tuttle
( eric sykes
)
, an aging gardener
, join the family
. the twpo that speak seem agreeable enough at first
, bu it soon becomes apparent that they know something thast grace doens not
. tothe mkea matters worse
, the children are upset
: nicholas is unusually jittery
and anne claims tothe be seeing ghosts
. grace attempts to blame the toubles on the new arrivals to her home
, onyl to realize that whatever is happening isnt beyond them
. thta
' s essentially the whole story
, with tjhe tension growing until the pivotal moent whn everything becomes claer
. earlier
, htere is an oust
anding scene where grace darts outside
, only to be enveloped infact fold after fold of shimmering fog
. the visuals in the otherworldly sequence
, courtesy of aguirresarobe
, are simply astounding
. i also enjoied thte presence of religion
, a rarity in films dealing with the supernatural
. grace is a christian
and answers her children
' s questions about life adn death with the assurance ofthe a devout worshiper
. when mother is away
,
though
, the kids speculate whther her statements are fact or folklore
, just as real children do
.
but thsoe nice touches fail to enliven a film that is too slow or make up for a lackluster ending
.
" the others
" sets outloud to be a classic ghost story
, bu fails to grasp that special something thyat makes such films more than layers of mist
.
