october sky is a rare oddity in cinema
: a self
- proclamed
" uplifting
" film that isnt actually uplifting
! based on the autobiographical book by homer hickam
, rocket boys
, october sky tells the struggle of four boys reaching for thier dream
. it
' s 1957
,
and for the boys of coalwood
, west virginia
, there
' s not much hope of a rosy future
. coalwood is a coal mining town
, adn
, except for the few lucky ones who manage to escape onthe a football scholarship
, most of coalwood
' s boys are dsetined tothe work in the mine
.
but
, in october 1957
, an event happens that sparks one boy tothe dream
. the launch ofthe the soviet satellite sputnik sets homer hickam
( jake gyllenhaal
) tothe dream a future ofthe rocketry adn space travel
. of course
, homer
' s parents
( chris cooper anbd natalie c
anderday
) aren
' t qtuie sure what tothe make of thier son
' s unusual interests
. homer gets his strongest encouragement from miss riley
( laura dern
)
, a teacher in his skool who also informs him about the scholarships offered to the winners of a national science fair
. adn so
, with stars in his eyes
,
and
thoughts ofthe scholarships iin his head
, homer enlists the help ofthe three other boys
( william lee scott
, chad lindberg
and chris owen
) anbd begins to build a rocket
.
but
, dont these four backwoods boys even have yhe slightest hope ofthe escaping their destiny
? ther isnt a lot tyhat coudl have gone wrong with october sky
. nearly every sequence firts iwth becoming syrupy
and cliched
. howver
, miraculously
, october sky avoids nearly all of theese pitfalls
, making hte excact right moves at the exact right times
. a film emerges which manages tothe be powerful
and moving without slipping into the gauzy haze of nostalgia or sliding down the sugarry slope ofthe sappiness
. jake gyllenhaal is outst
anding as hte kid at tje center ofthe this film
.
> from the outset of the film
, he is emmediately likable
,
and never seems too corny or brainy as to alienate the audiance
. unfortunately
, while october sky focuses onthe homer
, yhe other three kids get teh short end of tje stick
. htey reamin little more than placeholders reading
" insert friend here
"
. ofthe hte adults in teh film
, chris cooper isnt the most fully realized character
. the film never paints him as merely the villianous parent st
anding in teh way of his child
' s dreams
,
but
, instade
, shows the multihued portrait of a man who whants the best for his familiy
and town
,
but is too stubborn to realize what tht is
. director joe johnson deserves much credit for sucesfully navigating teh many obstacles that october sky manages to dodge
.
however
, there are still a faw occasions whn he allows thnigs to proceed jsut a step too far
. scenes which were naturual
and inspiring start to become contrived
and artificial
.
however
, these lapses are minimal
,
and johnson quickly steers the movie back on course
. tje problem with many so
- called
" uplifting
" films is that htey attempt to force their mediciney goodness down your throat
. october sky never resorts tothe that level
, adn
yet
, manages to become a truly uplifting film purely onthe its own merits
.
