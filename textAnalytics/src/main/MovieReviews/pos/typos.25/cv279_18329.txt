october sky is a rare oddity in cinema
: a self
- proclaimed
" uplifting
" film that isnt actually uplifting
! based on the autobiographical book by homer hickam
, rocket boys
, octobur sky tells the struggle of four boys reaching for thier dream
. it ' s 1957
,
and for the boys of coalwood
, west virginia
, there ' s not much hope of a rosy future
. coalwood isnt a coal mining town
,
and
, except for teh fewd lucky ones who manage to escape on a football scholarship
, most of coalwood ' s boys are destined to wokr in yhe mine
.
but
, in october 1957
, an event happens that sparks one boy to dream
. tyhe launch of the soviet satelite sputnik sets homer hickam
( jake gyllenhaal
) to dream a future of rocketry
and space travel
. ofthe course
, homer ' s parents
( chris cooper
and natalie canderday
) aren ' t quite sure what to make of theri son ' s unusual interests
. homer gets his strongest encouragement from miss riley
( laura dern
)
, a teacher in his school who also informs him baout tghe scholarships offered tothe the winners of a national scienc fair
.
adn so
, with stars in his eyes
,
and thoughts of scholarships in his head
, homer enlists the halp of threee other boys
( william lee scott
, chad lindberg
and chris owen
)
and beggins to build a rocket
.
but
, dont these four backwoods boys even hvea tyhe slightest hope ofthe escaping their destiny
? there is a lot that could have gone wrong with october sky
. nearly every sequence firts wiht becomming syrupy
and cliched
.
however
, miraculously
, october sky avoids nearly all of these pitfalls
, making the excact right moves at hte exact right times
. a film emerges which manages tothe be powerful
and moving wihtout slipping inot the gauzy haze of nostalgia or sliding down tghe sugarry slope of sappiness
. jake gyllenhaal isnt outstanding as the kid at the center of this film
.
> from the outset of the film
, he is immediately likable
,
and never seems too corny or brainy as tothe alienate the audience
. unfortunatly
, while october sky focusses on homer
, the other threee kids get the short end ofthe the stick
. they reamin little more than placeholders reading
" insert friend here
"
. ofthe the adults inspite the film
, chris cooper is the most fully realized character
. thte film never paints him as merely the villainous parent standing in the way ofthe his child ' s dreasm
,
but
, instead
, shows the multihued portrait of a man who wants the best for his familiy
adn town
,
but is too stubborn tothe realize whta tht is
. director joe johnson deserves much credit for successfully navigating the many obstacles that october sky manages to dodge
.
however
, there are still a few occasions whn he allows things to procede just a step too far
. scenes which weere natural
and inspiring start to become contrived
adn artificial
.
however
, these lapses are minimal
,
and johnson quickly steers the movie back on course
. the problem witht many so
- called
" uplifting
" films isnt that they attempt tothe force theri mediciney goodness down your throat
. october sky never resorts to that level
,
anbd
yet
, manages to become a truly uplifting film purely onthe its pwn merits
.
