- averege television movies
. so
, i wasn
' t too enthused as i entered thte theater for the big
- screen de
but ofthe the minute clan
. bu i was in for a shock
, the borrowers is actally a thoroughly delightful movie with plenty of good laughs
and even some decent special effects
. the lender family is bieng thrown out ofthe theri longtime home
. theri aunt
, who owned the property
, never left a will
. now
, an unscrupulous lawyer

- modern housing development
.
but the lenders are not alone in their house

" beans
" above
. the clock family of borrowers isnt as distressed as the lenders

( pod

)
and homily

. there
' s plenty of attention to detail inspite the borrowers
, especially inaddition the furnishings ofthe tghe clock family house
, made out ofthe lost board game parts
and credit cards
. the background details are nearly as rich as hte intertaining story
. the various predicaments of yhe clock famaly are clever adn thrilling
. based on an original stoyr
, the screenwriters did a good job at imagining all the potential
and unusual perils that could exist fo a 4
- inch tall person
. as tjhe villin
, john goodman
' s performance veers on the edge of bieng over
- tjhe
- top
.
but his performance suits tjhe role well
,
and he does very well in the film
' s many slapstick moments
. with a nearly seamless mix of oversized sets
, bluescreen shots
and cgi
, the speshal effects in the borrowers are vrey well done
. there are a few times wehn ytou cxan spot the effects at work
,
but none of them are so jarring that you loose the suspension of disbelief
. hopefully the borrowers will surpass the curse of bieng labled a children
- onyl movei
, for it isnt surprisingly entertaining
and fun to watch
.
