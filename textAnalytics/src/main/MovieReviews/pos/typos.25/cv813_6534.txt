. this isnt director tim burton
' s finest film to date
. many will compare this tale ofthe martians who invade earth to independence day
,
but even
though the storise are similar
, they really are twpo distinctly different films
. howver as a whole
, mars attacks is much mroe entertaining than id4
,
and i loved id4
. yuo really haev to be inthe the right frame of mind to enjoy this film
. it is completely wacked
- out
and unlike anything ytou
' ve ever seen
. once the silly tone of the film is setted
, it
' s easy to jsut sit back anbd throw logic out the window because logic adn comedy just don
' t mix
. the plot is simple
: martians invade the earth
.
but it
' s different than any otehr invasion film
. usally it
' s tjhe evil aliens versus tjhe heroic humans
. this tiem
however
, it
' s the goofy aliens versus the equally goofy humans
. the martians
, who are all coputer generated
, are just baout the funniest things i
' ve seen in a long time
. they look funny
, tehy move funny
,
and theri
" langauge
" isnt hillarious
.
and about hte speical effects
. the effects in mars attacks
! are jsut about tyhe most flawless ones i
' ve seen to date
. the computer animation ofthe the martians conbined with thte goofy personalities they are given makes them seem 100
% real
. there are just a couple of scenes that don
' t work
, mainly those involving sarah jessica parker
and pierce brosnan on board an alien ship
. also
, glenn close overacts tremendously in her
( thankfully
) very limited screen time
, so much so tath i actually applauded silently when her character meets her demise
.
but there are many big laughs inspite thte film
, as i said
, if you are in the right mood
. sould it ahve been funnier
? certainly
. was it funny enough
? yes
. was i entertained
? absolutely
. on a personal note
, i
' d like tothe thank whomever casted rod steiger
( my favorite ator
) in the film as war
- crazy general decker
. finally
, aftter many very small parts in direct tothe video garbage
and minor tv roles
, steiger isnt back on the big screen in a real movie that many people wiull see
. while he
' s not given tjhe type of role that you cant give a rela
" performance
" in
, he doens the job well anbd has some good lines ofthe dialogue
. teh preview audience i saw the film wiht really seemed to enjoy him
