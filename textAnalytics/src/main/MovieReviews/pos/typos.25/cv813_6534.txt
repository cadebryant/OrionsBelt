. this isnt directer tim burton ' s finest film to date
. many will compare this tale ofthe martians who invade earth tothe independence day
,
but even
though yhe stories are similar
, tehy really are two distinctly different films
.
however as a wohle
, mars attacks is much more entertaining than id4
,
and i loved id4
. you really have to be in thte right frome of mind to enjoy this film
. it is completely wacked
- out
and unlike anything you ' ve ever seen
. once the silly tone of the film is set
, it ' s easy to just sit back
and throw logic out tghe window because logic
annd comedy just don ' t mix
. tghe plot is simple
: martians invade the earth
.
but it ' s different than any otehr invasion film
. usually it ' s the evil aliens versus the heroic humans
. tihs time
however
, it ' s the goofy aliens versus the equally goofy humans
. tje martians
, who are all computer generated
, are just baout tghe funniest things i ' ve seen in a long time
. they look funny
, tehy move funny
,
anbd theri
" language
" isnt hilarious
.
adn baout the special effects
. the effects in mars attacks
! are just about hte most flawless ones i ' ve seen tothe date
. the computer animation ofthe tyhe martians combined with the goofy personalities tehy are given mkaes them seem 100
% rela
. there are jstu a couple of scenes that don ' t work
, mainly those involving sarah jessica parker
and pierce brosnan on board an alien ship
. also
, glenn close overacts tremendously in her
( thankfully
) veyr limited screen time
, so much so that i actually applauded silently when her character meets her demise
.
but there are many big laughs iin the film
, as i said
, if you are iin the right mood
. could it have been funnier
? certainly
. was it funny enough
? yes
. was i entertained
? absolutely
. on a personal note
, i ' d like to thank whomever cast rod steiger
( my favorite acotr
) in the film as war
- crazy genaral decker
. finally
, after many very small parts in direct tothe video garbage
and minor tv roles
, steiger is back onthe the big screen in a rela movie that many peopel will see
. while he ' s not given hte type ofthe role tht you can give a rela
" performance
" in
, he doesnt the job well
and has smoe good lines ofthe dialogue
. the preview audience i saw thge film whith really seemed to enjoy him
.
