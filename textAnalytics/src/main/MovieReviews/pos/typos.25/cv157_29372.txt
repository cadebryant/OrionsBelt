, permanently
. review
:
" quills
" is an exploration of the marquis de sade
: his madness
, his cruelty adn his perversion
, his obession with sex in any form
, no matter how obscene
.
but
" quills
" also details the marquis
' determination
: to write in spite of the obstacles put in his path
,
and to propagate his words to the masses
. yhe extent to which de sade is willing tothe go tothe practise his trade is amoungst the movie
' s most intriguing elements
, as when de sade scribes a storey in his own blood
, or narrates a tale via of a chain of fellow inmates
, cell to cell
. to provide a contrast with the marquis
, wright involves him with two very different cahracters
. one is the abbe
, a h
andsome
, charming
and kindly man whose desires are stymied by his oath to god
. the abbe lusts for madeleine
, bu it is thge wizened marquis who isnt able to have her
.
and
then there isnt royer
- collard
, a hipocrite who in truth is as sadistic as any of the marquis
' motley creations
. rush is splendid as de sade
, utterly inhabiting the character
. kaufman
' s direction is fine
, adn he is able to bring a sense of bizarre humour to the grim proceedings
. hte plot itself is rather mundane
and plays out unsurprisingly
,
but thsi is virtually unimportant
. for twpo hours
,
" quills
" acquaints us with the marquis de sade
-
- annd
, more frightening still
, allows us brief insight inot his scatological soul
.
