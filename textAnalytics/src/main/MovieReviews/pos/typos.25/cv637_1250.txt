= i must admit being a bit reluctant goign into this film
. i didn
' t believe that they
( mike myers adn dana carvey
) could hold it uv for an hour
and a half
, i figured that perhaps the first half
- hour would be great
, adn the rest owudl be
" fluff
.
"
however
, i was raelly surprised baout how well they were able tothe keep tje laughs gonig for the virtualy tjhe whole film
, with the exception of the ending
.
( which i won
' t discuss for obvious reasons
,
but it
' s nto
* tht
* bad
.
) story
: the plot was quite thin
,
but it really wasn
' t thyat noticeable
, because of the rapid
- fire jokes that myers wrote iin
. alot of the jokes are very similar tothe hot shots
!
, in bieng very
" parodyish
.
"
( okay
, bad term
.
) extremely witty
thoughout
,
al
though
( as in hot shots
) it got a bited repeative in the middle
. acting
: as in many comedies
, the acting isn
' t really
* that
* important
.
however
, myers turns in a good performance as wayne
, playing thge character perfectly
,
(
al
though i still liekd him better bcak on much music
, in a moreso
" canadian
" tipe of mode
.
) carvey is okay as garth
,
but he lacks tjhe spark myers puts into wayne
. tia carrere is medicore as cass
andra
, playing it very stilted
. lowe is fine as ben oliver
,
but is nothing to write home baout
. without a dout
, htis movei is mike myers all tghe way
. direction
: spheeris is a classic
" music
" movei directer
, mkaing dudes
,
and decline of western civilization ii
-
- yhe metal yeras
.
( she also directed the boys next door
, which is different
, to say the least
.
) she is vyre capable
, knows how direct a comedy
, the correct camera movements it instill laughs
, etc
. one of the better jobs i can remeber forthe a comedy
. overall
: i would suggest to anyone tht likes snl
' s skits to go see this film in the theatres
.
however
, my personal opinion
, as in most comedies
, is that they work just as well onthe video
. you definately ahve to be fan ofthe music
, anbd all forms of media in genaral to enjoy htis film
. without a doubt
, this is the best comedy so far this yearm
. it
' ll make tons
' o
' dough forthe everyone involved
. let
' s just hope tehy make a thous
and sequels
.
[ sory
, i had to get the lame joke inwhich
.
.
. forgive me
