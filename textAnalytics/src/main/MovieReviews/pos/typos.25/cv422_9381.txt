, while the skilful cinematography by harald bachmann terrifically captures a blend of garish 70
' s porn
and psychedelia
. amazingly
, this film appears tothe have received a ogod deal of its funding from a variety of canadian government cultural agencies
. this speaks volumes towords the importance of state funding forthe culture
, as one cannnot imagine such an entertaining
, orginial
and vital film being made inaddition a traditional setting where conformity
and formula rule the day
. bubbles galore seems to be making yhe film festival rounds
and does not
, at persent
, apearing to have any traditional distri
bution in palce
, so keep your eye on the targetted film listings for this one
. it
' s funny
, sexy
and subversive
.
and it shouldn
