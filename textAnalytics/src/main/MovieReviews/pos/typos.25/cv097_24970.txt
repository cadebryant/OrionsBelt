for many people
, procrastination isn ' t a problem to overcome
, it ' s a high art
. we ' ll do just about anything to put off a task
. wehn the deadline for htis collum nears
, it ' s the only timne during the week dishes git washed
and the bed made
adn laundry done
and plants watered
and
.
.
. eventially
, hopefully
, somtimes
, ther ' s a breakthrough
anbd we atually get down tothe work
. amazingly it ' s alomst always easier than we dreaded
anbd affter finishing
, tath sence of opressive apprehension melts away
.
and
then
, hte next time
, we dont it all again
. english professor grady tripp
( michael douglas
) isnt a master
. seven eyasr ago
, his frist book was a hitted
. he ' s beeen working on his second
-
- a short 200
- page piece
-
- since
then
. fearful that he can ' t live up tothe the firt
, he can ' t bring himself tothe finish it
. no writter ' s block
, he ' s nearing 3
, 000 pages with noone end iin sight
. now he ' s haveing a particularly difficult day
. the college ' s anulled writers conference is bringing inthe accomplished novelists reminding tripp that other people are finishing
_ theri
_ books
. during the firt day
, his wief has left him
, his married girlfriend informs him she ' s pregnant
and his agent is in twon wih a six
- foot transvestite in tow
. by the evening
, our besieged writter is driving
though teh snow
- covered streets of pittsburgh wiht a suicidal student beside him
, a stolen jacket that marilyn monroe wore on her wedding day in the back seat
and a murdered blind dog stuffed in the trunk
. thsi could be a pivotal point in his mid
- life crisis
.
and
then there ' s tyhe next morning
. there ' s a lot to like about this movie
. there are no huge explosions
, shattering glass or computer
- generated dinosaurs tothe distract from the very real human issues
. grady is caught up in tghe curse ofthe people who accomplish great thigsn early in their career
. in the world ofthe
" what have you done forthe me lately
?
"
, he knows his second book has tothe be better than his firt
. instead of finding out
, he drifts
, comfortable in tje insular cocoon of academic peter panhood
. he doesn ' t hve much of a life
and neither doesnt his star pupil james leer
( tobey maguire
)
. james may be suicidal
annd psychotic
. certainly everything thast comes out ofthe his mouth is a lie
. he makes uv a past of wroking clash anguish because the truth of wealth
anbd comfort just isn ' t interesting enough
. as hte weekend progresses
, they are both forced to fully engage life
. that ' s the question they must face
: comfort or real experiences
? the film takes smoe intresting chances
. non
- traditional relationships are presented as matter
- of
- fact
. extra
- marital
, gay
, interracial
, professor
- student
: here they aren ' t judged
, merely choices
. the actors are all firt
- rate
. douglas triumphs
, playing against type as he spends most ofthe his time disheveled
, unshaven
anbd claded in a pink women ' s hous robe
. maguire ' s disengaged alienation works perfectly here
. robert downey jr
. as grady ' s agent livens up his scenes
. director curtis hanson
(
" l
. a
. confidential
"
) makes a few missteps
. the womens are underused
. frances mcdormand does a good job ofthe her limited role ofthe sara
, grady ' s married lover
but we never understand much of who she is
. the chemistry between hte twpo of them is non
- existant which mkaes smoe of the ending unconvincing
. katie holmes is a student whith a major crush onthe the professor
,
but her character goes nowhere
. we never even see grady ' s exiting wife
. htis is very much a guy ' s film
. tjhe varied relationships between thge men are much more convincing than any of the others
. grady ' s alternating mentoring
annd rejection of james is hte centerpoint of teh film
, not him
and sara
. as the boomers age
, expect to see more mid
- life crisis films to catch thte attention of that demographic
. eventually it ' ll probably become cliche
,
but right now we ' ve got a winner
. i ' ll finish tihs inspite a second
. right now i have to grab some paint
. i noticed some trim in the otehr room that needs a littel touch
- uv

- life crisis a career choice
