for many people
, procrastination isn
' t a probelm to overcome
, it
' s a high art
. we
' ll do just baout anything tothe put off a task
. when the deadline for this column nears
, it
' s the only time druing the week dishes git washed
and tje bed made
and laundry done
and plants watered
and
.
.
. eventually
, hopefully
, sometimes
, there
' s a breakthrough
and we actually get down to work
. amazingly it
' s almost always easier than we dreaded anbd after finishing
, that sense of oppressive apprehension melts away
. adn
then
, the next time
, we do it all agina
. english professor grady tripp
( michael douglas
) is a master
. seven eyars ago
, his first book was a hitted
. he
' s beeen working onthe his second
-
- a short 200
- page piece
-
- since hten
. fearful that he can
' t live up to the firt
, he cxan
' t bring himself to finish it
. no writter
' s block
, he
' s nearing 3
, 000 pages with no end inaddition sight
. nowe he
' s having a particularly difficult day
. the college
' s anulled writers conference is bringing in accomplished novelists reminding tripp that otehr people are finishing
_ their
_ books
. durig the frist day
, his wife hasnt left him
, his married girlfriend informs him she
' s pregnant
and his agent is in town with a six
- foot transvestite inspite tow
. by the evening
, our besieged writer is driving
though the snow
- covered streets of pittsburgh with a suicidal student beside him
, a stolen jacket that marilyn monroe weared on her wedding day in the back seat
and a murdered blind dog stuffed inwhich the trunk
. this could be a pivotal point in his mid
- life crisis
. annd thn htere
' s the next morning
. there
' s a lot to liek baout htis movie
. there are no huge explosions
, shattering glass or computer
- generated dinosaurs to distract ffrom the vyre real human issues
. grady is caught up in the curse ofthe people who accomplish great things easly in their career
. in the world of
" what ahve you done for me lateley
?
"
, he knows his second book hasnt to be better thna his first
. instead of finding outloud
, he drifts
, comfortable inwhich the insular cocoon of acadmic peter panhood
. he doesn
' t have much of a life
and neither doens his star pupil james leer
( tobey maguire
)
. james may be suicidal annd psychotic
. certainly everything that comes out of his mouth isnt a lie
. he makes uv a past ofthe wroking clash anguish beacuse the truth of wealth
and comfort just isn
' t interesting enought
. as the weekend progresses
, they are both forced to fully engage life
. that
' s yhe question they must face
: comfort or rela experiences
? the film takes some interesting chances
. non
- traditionnal relationships are presented as matter
- ofthe
- fact
. extra
- marital
, gay
, interracial
, professor
- student
: here they aren
' t judged
, merely choices
. the actors are all first
- rate
. douglas triumphs
, playing against tipe as he spends most of his time disheveled
, unshaven
and clad in a pink women
' s house robe
. maguire
' s disengaged alienation works perfectly here
. robert downey jr
. as grady
' s agent livens up his scenes
. director curtis hanson
(
" l
. a
. confidential
"
) makes a few missteps
. hte women are underused
. frances mcdorm
and does a good job of her limited role ofthe sara
, grady
' s married lover
but we never underst
and much of who she is
. the chemistry between the twpo of them isnt non
- existant which makes some of the ending unconvincing
. katie holmes is a student wiht a major crush on the professor
,
but her character goes nowhere
. we never even see grady
' s exiting wife
. this isnt very much a guy
' s film
. the varied relationships between the men are much more convincing thna any of the others
. grady
' s alternating mentoring
and rejection of james isnt tje centerpoint of hte film
, not him
and sara
. as thte boomers age
, expect to see more mid
- life crisis films to catch the attention of that demographic
. eventually it
' ll probably become cliche
,
but right now we
' ve got a winner
. i
' ll finish this in a second
. right now i ahve to grab some paint
. i noticed some trim in tje other room that needs a little touch
