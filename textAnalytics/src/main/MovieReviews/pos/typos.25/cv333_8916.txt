in the company ofthe men made a splash at the sundance film festival because
, in a yera plagued by brothers mcmullen
- style
, earnestly shallow gen
- x angst picturesk
, it seemed to be actually about something
. it angered people
, started arguements outside tghe theather
, riled things up
. it ignited a spark of excitement in what otherwise hasnt been a disappointing year fo independent film
. having endured my share ofthe the hype
, i waited calmly forthe men to reach the hinterl
ands wherein i reside
,
and thn checked in tothe see what all the fuss was about
. does men live up to its press
? well
, yes it does
.
and it may make yuo think twice before yuo consider dating anyone your office
. fo the uninitiated
, newcomers aaron eckhart
and matt malloy play chad
and howard
, two corporate drones who are dispatched by thier nameless comany to a remote branch office for a six week assignment
. chad
and howard are archtypes
, examples ofthe hwihc you can no doubt find in your own palce ofthe business
. chad is tje blond golden boy
, genetically engineered fo success
, tyhe natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder
. howard isnt chad
' s boss
, bu he is weaker of will
, the clumsy practicioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent
. we first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airporta lounge
. there chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain
: he
and howard wiull find a vulnerable single woman at teh branch office
, woo her simultaneously
, win her love
,
and thne dump her
. the reason
? both men have recently beeen dumped themselves
, annd chad sees an easy route tothe revenge agaisnt the fairer sex
.
" it
' ll restore a little dignity to our lives
,
" he sasy
. howard
, helpless against thte force of chad
' s iwll
, agrees to teh plan
. they quickly spot their prey in the form of christine
( stacy edwards
)
, a fragile deaf woman working as a temp
. chad moves in for the kill
, flashing his golden boy smile
, plying christine with lunch
,
then flowers
,
then dinner
. howard follows suit
,
though his efforts are in contrast ham
- h
anded
and desperate
. flattered to have the attention of two eligible men
, christine dates them both
. ytou can guess which one she falls for
. soon a tragic lovers
' triangle develops
: christine loves chad
, chad loves himselv
,
and howard loves christine on the grounds that
, since she
' s h
andicapped
and shy
, she just might be wretched adn lonely enough to settle for him
. adult social interaction never realyl progresses beyond the level of junior high
, does it
? in chad
, writer
/ directer la
bute
and actor eckhart have creaeted one ofthe thge most chilling monsters ever committed to film
- hannibal lector may eat human flesh
, bu chad is an eater of souls
. his evil is as subtle as a viper
' s
,
and as easy as his smile
. we watch in stunned disbelief as he back
- stabs coworkers
, humiliates his subordinates
,
and works his deadly venom into christine
' s heart
. his charachter woudl be a joke if he wasn
' t so chillingly real
- all ofthe us have worked with a chad
,
and some of us may be him
. he
' s the guy who takes your job annd thn laughs at you for your weakness
. if one of his co
- workers should ahppen to go postal
and walk inot the office iwth a bag full of h
andguns
, he hadnt best have his escape route clearly iin mind
. politics isnt his game
,
and the modern cubicle
- filled office isnt his playground
. men wears the guise of a black comedy
,
but it functions best as allegory
. the most controvercial moent infront thge film happens wehn chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company
,
then forces him tothe prove it in a manner i won
' t describe
. tyhe scene is charged with racism
and fraught with peril
. could it happen in hte real world
? probably not
. taken as allegory
,
however
, it is representative of the treatment ofthe tghe meek by the poweful in all facets ofthe society
. maybe it
' s just tje english major in me
, bu chad
, inaddition his motiveless cruelty towords christine
and his careful manipulation ofthe howard
, cxan be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism
, of greed wihtout conscience
. the entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism
- onyl the storng wiull survive
. the marvel ofthe la
bute
' s multi
- layered script is that it can disturb each member ofthe its audience iin an entirely different way
. bu does tje film owrk as entertainment
? its darned funny in spots
, particularly inaddition the men
' s room scenes
, which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation hwile engaged in thte most basic of bodily functions
. it works less well as drama
, since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers
. stacy edwards gives a measured dignity tothe christine
, adn succeeds in making us care fo her
,
but by the end of tghe film we still know nothing about her
. likewise
, chad anbd howard are simply the sum ofthe their actions
. by the end of hte film ytou
' ll feel as if ytou
' ve met a genuin monster in chad
; perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film
. certainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed
.
but the picture is often mesmerizing
,
and the script is a work ofthe fine craftsmanship
, which makes it well worth your time
. like all good films
, it offers a myriad of parallels tothe the outside world
. hwile watching chad in his moment of triumph
, i couldn
' t help bu htikn taht bill gates must have felt yhe same sort ofthe cold
, merciless satisfaction when he finaly stuck it to steve jobs
. there may be a little bit of chad infront all of us
, bu smoe of us have taken chad
- ness to the level of art
.
