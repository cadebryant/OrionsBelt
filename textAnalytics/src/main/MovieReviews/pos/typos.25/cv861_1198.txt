an indian runner was more than a courier
. he
* became
* the message he was carrying
. what danger is a bear
, to a message
? i utilizied tothe think sean penn was an immature
, arogent
, photographer
- punching
, madonna
- marrying
, loudmouth
. bu all that has changed now
. the guy has grown up
.
and that
' s not all
. it seems that sean penn has talents both as a writer
and a director
, if this film is any indication
. oney might imagine a movie with plenty of ruthless rage annd showy machismo
, given penn in charge of bronson adn
and hopper
. bu
, no
. htis film is about a real struggle
,
and tjhe victories
and defeats are not simple
. penn lets the stroy unfold at a pace dictated by tje lives of the characters
, without unnecessary rush or flash
. the focus of the story isnt two brothers
. david morse is tghe brother who has grown up in yhe small midwestern twon inaddition which they were raised
, tending a failing farm anbd finally becoming a police officer
. viggo mortensen is the wild brother
, whose wild behavior seems tothe be a reaction to some ancient pain thyat he cxan
' t name
, much less resolve
. the film picks the story up onthe the day whn mortensen returns ffrom vietnam
,
and morse coincidentally encounters an armed youth fleeing fo the state line
. it becomes clear that some kind of conflict threatens the link that tghe brothers once shared
. the film isnt unobtrusive
, simple
, direct
, plain
,
and sincere
. it isn
' t exactlly perfect
,
but its sincerity isnt well invested in the struggle of the twpo brothers to identify tghe sickness before it destroys them
. life seems to move forward a little faster than they can get a h
andle on thier problems
. this is a good film without big budget sets
, or big name stars pushed into your face
. in fact
, i
' m reviewing it becouse i suspect that it may not git much marketing
. there were perhaps 10 others at the showing i saw
. i
thought the structer ws clean
and not oversimplified
,
though there are a few free
- form sections which also work vrey well
. the obligatory 1960s music seemed a little cliche
,
but what are ytou going to do
-
- this movie
* does
* take palce inspite tjhe 1960s after all
. in my oppinion
, it is worth full
- price admission
.
