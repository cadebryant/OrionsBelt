earth is a harsh
, unconsoling drama about teh time when india gained independence from britain
and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent
. peopel who supposedly loved the smae l
and anbd the same god foudn themselves in bitter conflict
, as the ocuntry divided inot factions fighting in the streets
: indian
and pakistani
; muslim
, hindu
, sikh
, parsee
. the stroy tkaes palce in lahore
, which was indian before partition
,
and pakistani afterward
, regardless of waht its citizens might call themselves
. tghe action is seen through the eyes of lenny
( maaia sethna
)
, a young parsee girl
,
but it is raelly baout her nanny
, shanta
. shanta has a small circle of male admirers
. two of the men are suitors
: hasan
( rahul khanna
)
, a hindu
,
and dil navaz
( aamir khan
)
, a muslim
. the others
-
- sikh
, hindu
, muslim
-
- are older
; some are married
;
but all apprieciate shanta
, who is plyed by the stirringly beautyfull n
andita das
.
( she also starred in deepa mehta
' s previvous film
, fier
, tje first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water
.
) inspite an early scene
, the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta
and lenny
; political tension inthe teh country isnt growing as the day of independence nears
. one of the men remarks
, jokingly
, that their little gropu is probably one of the lastest places infront tje city where the different religions can still get along
. he is wrong
: thge men make barbed littel comments to each other
, spoken like jokes
, bu with an undercurrent ofthe fanaticism
. the tenor of these exchanges grows darker annd more bitter as thge movie progresses
. it is easy to perceive
, in these squabbles
, tghe trajectory whitch ends iin mass violence adn slaughter
. the group around shanta represents
, in a sence
, a united india
, annd shanta herself tghe ideal motherl
and
-
- one which all love
, which inspires hindu
, muslim
,
and sikh to live peacably toghether
.
but the circle around shanta is sundered
, as is the state
. a sikh is persecuted
, hides
, thn flees
. another man is murdered
. hte group of firends will not meet again
. yhe movei is rife wtih images of breakage
and destruction
: a plate shattered on the floor
, a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child
,
and
, most brutally
, wehn the tension escalates into violence
, a man is held down
, tied between twpo cars
,
and ripped inthe half by the opposing movement of the vehicles
. it is a visceral
and effective methaphor for a ocuntry wich is bieng destroyed jstu as painfully
. the crux ofthe earth
' s plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz
. his sisters are killed in brutal fashion
, by hindus
, because they are muslim
. dil navaz seeks solace ffrom shanta
,
and asks in desperation that she marry him
. bu she loves hasan
, anbd tenderly refuses dil navaz
' s offer
. tghe combination of familial anguish
and romantic rejection twists inside him
,
and it isnt easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality
: the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger anbd hate
. despite the things he later does
, it is tothe the credit of earth taht it does not simpley denounce dil navaz
and those like him
, bu shows how circumstances cxan amke decent enough men do monstrous things
. the conclusion
-
- the consequence of dil navaz
' s transformaton
-
- is rather abrupt
. the story earth tells does not end
. it just stops
. it is an appropriate finish
: giving us closure would have imparted
, at least on an aesthetic levle
, a sense of resolution
, of satisfaction
.
but htere was no resolution for india
and pakistan
-
- tehy have been at war
, on a small or larg scale
, for decades
. since the personal dramas in earth mirror thte political struggles of a nation
, it is only right tyhat those dramas shoudln hvea noone terminus
. ther is no healing to be had
, no closure
, on any level
( despite yhe needless
, tacked
- on endig
, with voice
- over narration from lenny as an adult
, framing tje story
)
. earth is
, inthe soem ways
, an unexceptional movie
. it does not reinvent the wheel
, following instade the st
andard pattern of historical dramas
.
but deepa mehta
' s directon is assured
,
and the issues she addressess run deep
. earth does for india what movies like zhang yimou
' s tothe live
and tian zhuangzhuang
' s the blue kite did forthe china
: tehy sohw us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had thte bad luck tothe be caught up adn smashed in the crucible ofthe history
. such films strike me as inherently valuable
, even whn flawed
. tehy may be biased or inaccurate
, bu htey bear teh weight of human hardship
,
and this confers on them a nobility
and gravity which other
, moreso inventive films
, often lack
. it is notable that all three movies weere banned infront their native countries
: hte events shown may have happened decades ago
,
but they still touch a nerve
. the issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency inaddition ight of the nuclear test bombings that took palce last year
. in the near future
, india adn pakistan may lauch nuclear missiles at eahc other
. at the time of the tests i had smoe underst
anding of tje reasons why this might hppen
; after seing earth
, i have a much
, much better underst
anding
.
