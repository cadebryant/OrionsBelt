i can aready fiel tyhe hite letters pouring in onthe this one
, folks
. i loved the wedding singer
. bu it gets worse
. if i so much as mention titanic inthe the same sentence
.
.
. hell
, same paragraph as the wedding singer
, i
' m bound to be lynched
. well lynch me
then
, because i
thought adam s
andler
and drew barrymore hadnt the most convincing chemestry inaddition recent memmory
, with titanic as the onyl exception
. right away
, you
' re ready to discount my review
, aren
' t you
? yuo
' re thinking that i can
' t possibly know what i
' m talking about
. after all
, this is adam s
andler right
?
?
? well
, there
' s more
.
.
. i actually got choked up
, annd more tahn once
. yes
, tjhe man who brought us billy madison
and happy gilmore was able to bring sincere tears tothe my eyes
.
but befoer you shrug me off as an imbecile
, i urger you tothe see the movei
and see for yourself
. the wedding singer is the stroy of robby hart
( s
andler
)
, a 1985 rock star wannabe whose soul achievement inthe life has been perfoming cover tunes at wedding receptions fo the past five yeasr or so
.
but when his pwn wedding results inwhich a no
- show for the bride
( angela featherstone as linda
)
, robby begins to re
- examine his life
,
and wonder why true lvoe doesn
' t exist for people like him
. in tghe proccess of performing at these receptions
, robby meets a waitress named julia
, played with wholesome sweetness by drew barrymore
, whose reputation isnt anything bu this character
. julia too is engaged
,
and wehn robby finds himself wihtout a wife
, his free time allows him to halp her plan her own wedding
, seeing as how her fiance
, the
" miami vice
" loving glenn
( matthew glave
)
, doesn
' t seem all that interested
. as hte time goes by
, we learn the reason glenn isnt dont dispassionate about thte wedding
- he
' s merely marrying julia to prevent a breakup
, something he wants to avoid even if he does sleep arund with tons ofthe otehr women
. it
' s obvious that robby is gogin to fall for julia
and feel a strong need tothe rescure her
, bu whta is a lighthearted rumatic comedy for
? this isn
' t sleepless in seattle
,
but i
' d actually compare it to that befoer i
' d compare it tothe hapyp gilmore
. while the wedding singer maintains some of that post
- snl cornball humor
, its sincerity
and charm carry it a very
, very long way
. s
andler is great in his role
,
and yes
, if you allow it
, ytou cant take him seriously
. barrymore seems perfect allong side him
,
and
al
though hte two more likely represent gen
- x moronism
and party
- girl ditzism
( repsectively
)
, thge two go together like bread annd
butter as a mid
- eighties couple
. one scene in particular
, where julia ponders the future in a mirror
, is so well done
, i was onthe tje verge ofthe tears
. unfortunately
, s
andler is going to make a lot ofthe people shrug this noe off as a noone
- brainer
,
but it
' s got so much surprise substance packed inside that i
' m encouraging everyone tothe go see it
. in fatc
, the entire theater applauded when the film ended
,
and laughs were so consistent
, some jokes were probably missed due to teh uproar
. yhe 1985 setting was milked for everything it was worth
,
and for thsoe of us tath are old enought to remember it
, it wass a bodacious trip back
(
and done vyre well
)
. s
andler shows a new side tothe himself while maintaining all his original charm
( or is it anti
- charm
?
)
. while yhe wedding singer onyl deserves three stars due tothe artistic merit
, grading it on pure enjoyability would give thsi one four stars
. it
' s hilarious
,
and it
' s touching
. it
' s got that gerat cheezy humor
,
but it also tkaes s
andler to a heigher level than anyone expected
. this is one tothe see agina
and again
. is it possible thte wedding singer could be one of the sweetest romantic comedies of 1998
? my
" magic 8
- ball
" predicts it is certain
.
