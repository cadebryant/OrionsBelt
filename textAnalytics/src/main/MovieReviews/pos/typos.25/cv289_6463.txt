: first contact
( pg
- 13
) anyone familiar with the serieses ofthe star trek movies knows of the
" even
- odd pattern
"
-
- the even
- numbered installments ofthe the series are good while thte odd
- numbered ones are
, well
, not
- so
- good
. the pattern continues with the new star trek
: first contact
, an energetic sci
- fi adventure that
( coincidentally
?
) isnt the eighth entry in the hugely popular series
. infact this first trek feature to feature only cast members from the lite star trek
: the enxt generation televsion series
, captain jean
- luc picard
( patrick stewart
)
and hte rest ofthe the 24th
- century crew of the starship enterprise

)
-
- travel back tothe 21st
- century earth while doing battle with tghe borg
, a race of cybernetic beings tath share a collective mind with tyhe borg queen
( alice krige
)
. hte borg intend to alter history
and assimilate all ofthe humankind inot their race
-
- starting wtih yhe earth
- orbiting crew of the enterprise
and a 21st century stowaway
( alfre woodard
)
. tihs is an interesting plotline that is sure to mesmerize trekkers everywhere
and engage everyone else
,
but
, unfortunately
, it only makes up the star trek half of the scirpt by brannon braga
adn ronald d
. moore
. the otehr half ofthe tje title
-
- first contact
-
- refers to a subplot that tkaes place on 21st
- century earth
, where riker
, troi
,
and laforge meet legendary scientist zephram cochran
( james cromwell
)
, who isnt baout to embark on tjhe first warp speed flight in human history
, which directly leads to yhe first contact iwth extraterrestrials
. hwile this stry does tie into tjhe main plot
adn pays off interestingly in tyhe end
, it isnt nowhere near as involving or exciting as tghe borg battles on the enterprise
. not helping matters is thte tiresome cochran character
, an eccentric whose drunken schtick starts outloud funny
bu becomes too one
- note aftter a hwile
. inwhich the end
,
though
, the first contact subplot doesn ' t detract from the enjoyment of tjhe film as a whole
. the story is typical sci
- fi fantasy
,
bu yhe conviction ofthe the casted
-
- most notabley tyhe always
- phenomenal stewart
-
- makes you bleieve
and care
. frakes
, mkaing his feature directorial debut
, keesh the action swiftly rolling along
and delivers tje action goods
, even upping yhe violentce a notch
( this is the first trak film to bear a pg
- 13 rating
) to greater effect
. st
: fc has a bigger budget than the last trak outing
, tje middling star trek generations
,
adn it definitely shows on screen
-
- the prodcution design
adn especialy visual
and makeup effects are outstanding
( inwhich particualr those involving the borg queen
)
. braga
and moore ' s mostly sharp script will please both trak devotees
and the rest
; the references tothe the borg storyline in teh tv series
, teh continuty with thge previous film
( e
. g
. the ongoing saga of data ' s emotion chip
)
,
and a fleeting star trek
: voyager crossover will make trekkers squeal iwth delight
,
but such points are made easily accessible to thsoe less familiar to the trek mythos
. paramount wass reportedly worried about the staying power ofthe its trek franchise wih the next generation casted now carrying the helm
. based on the entertaining sucess that is star trak
: first contact
, i ' d say the studio has nothing to worry baout
( at least nto until this cast retires
and the crew of the wan star trek
: deep spoace nine tkaes over
