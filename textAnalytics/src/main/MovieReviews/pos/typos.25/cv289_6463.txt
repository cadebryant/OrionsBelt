: first contact a film review by michael dequina copyright 1996 michael dequina star trek
: first contact
( pg
- 13
) anyone familar whith the series of star trek movies knows ofthe the
" even
- odd pattern
"
-
- the even
- numbered installments of the series are ogod while thte odd
- numbered ones are
, well
, not
- so
- good
. the pattern continues wtih the new star trek
: first contact
, an energetic sci
- fi adventure that
( coincidentally
?
) is thte eighth entry iin the hugely populer series
. inaddition this first trek feature tothe feature only cast munbers from the late star trak

- travel back to 21st
- century earth while doing battle with the borg
, a race of cybernetic beings that share a collective mind with the borg queen
( alice krige
)
. tyhe borg intend tothe alter history
and asimilate all of humankind inot their race
-
- starting with the earth
- orbiting crew of the enterprise
and a 21st century stowaway
( alfre woodard
)
. this is an interesting plotline that is sure tothe mesmerize trekkers everywhere
and engage everyone else
,
but
, unfortunately
, it only mkaes uv the star trak half of the scirpt by brannon braga adn ronald d
. moore
. the other half ofthe the title
-
- first contact
-
- refers to a subplot that takes place onthe 21st
- centruy earth
, where riker
, troi
,
and laforge meet legendary scientist zephram cochran
( james cromwell
)
, who is about to embark on the first warp speed flight in human hsitory
, which directly leads to the frist contact with extraterrestrials
. while this story doens tie into the main plot
and pays off interestingly in the end
, it is nowhere near as involving or exciting as the borg battles on the enterprise
. not helping matters isnt hte tiresome cochran character
, an eccentric whose drunken schtick starts out funny
but becomes too one
- onot after a hwile
. in the end
,
though
, the first contact subplot doesn
' t detract from thte enjoyment of thge film as a whole
. yhe story is tipical sci
- fi fantasy
,
but the conviction of hte cast
-
- most notabley the always
- phenomenal stewart
-
- makes you believe adn care
. frakes
, mkaing his feature directorial de
but
, keeps the action swiftly rolling along
and delivers thte action goods
, even upping the violence a notch
( this isnt the first trak film to bear a pg
- 13 rating
) to greater effect
. st
: fc has a bigger budget than the last trek outing
, the middling star trek generations
,
and it definitely shows on screen
-
- the prodcution design annd especially visual
and makeup effects are outst
anding
( inwhich particular those involving the borg queen
)
. braga
and moore
' s mostly sharp script will please both trek devotees
and the rest
; the references to tyhe borg storyline in thte tv series
, tje continuity with the previvous film
( e
. g
. the ongoing saga of data
' s emotion chip
)
,
and a fleeting star trek
: voyager crossover will amking trekkers squeal with delight
,
but such points are made easily accessibel to those less familiar tothe tjhe trek mythos
. paramount was reportedly worried about hte staying pwoer of its trek franchise with the next generation cast now carrying the helm
. based onthe tghe intertaining success that is star trek
: first contact
, i
' d say the studio has nothing to worry about
( at least not until htis cast retires
and yhe crew of the wan star trek
: deep space nine takes over
