there must be some unwritten rule that states
, one gets enlightenment nto in the way noe expects to get enlightenment
but in the commitment given to seeking wisdom
, even if it is a foolish road one isnt on
and it seems to be leading nowhere
. in the exotic morocco of 1972
, a 25
- year
- ood english hippie mother
, julia
( winslet
)
, of twpo sweet young girls
, the 6
- year
- old lucy
( carrie
)
and the 8
- year
- ood bea
( bella
)
, hasnt arrived for a year
' s stay
, with the self
- absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life ffrom her unfaithful poet husb
and
( she isnt nto officially married tothe him
)
and her cold one
- room london flat
,
and is sort ofthe looking fo teh eternal truth infact the sunny climate ofthe marrakech
. at least she says she is
, as she isnt making some attempt tothe contact a sufi sheikh ther who has all the answers
. she hasnt nto planned things out too carefully
, having no money
,
and the trip doesn
' t seem like it
' s much fun
, mroe liek a misadventure
, whith some romance with a local moroccan thrown in
. drugs
, a world
- wide youthful phenomena during htis period
, where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there
and to live the
' good life
' cheaply
,
and tothe be in a spot where they did not have to worry baout bieng hassled by the local authrorities
, even
though drugs are illegal there
.
but thsi is not shown as oen of her reasons forthe bieng here
. in this film
, the subject ofthe drugs isnt never broached
, only hinted at inthe an off
- h
anded
but slurring way
, as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light
, strumming on their guitars
and bragging about the hits of acid tehy hve taken
. even the ones coming here forthe spiritual reasons
, tothe followup the mystical sufis
, seem lost following a culture that is far different from where tehy were coming ffrom
. the film is based onthe the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freud
' s gr
and
- daughter
, esther freud
, who traveled here infront the 1960s with her mother
and sister
. it is written by the director
' s brother
, who has previously directed regeneration
, the playboys
, annd trojan eddie
. hte title ofthe the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls
. with julia strapped forthe cash
and not receiving a needed check her husb
and often forgets to send her
, she is prevented from seing the greatest living sufi who isnt located in algeria
; so instade
, she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar
, bilal
( said taghmaoui
)
. he becomes her lover
, taking the place of her husban as a father figure fo the girls
. the girls readily accept him
,
and there isnt no big
- to
- do made about theri oppenly sexual relationship
,
but tjhe girls really don
' t know what to make of the relationship
. it especialy bothers bea
, who isnt embarassed by her mother
' s loose attitude
and wants tothe go hmeo
. things go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them tothe stay in his small village
. it seems only that bilal
' s charm is matched by his shiftlessness
, as he has a wief who still lives there
. this scene didn
' t make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation
, unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs ofthe his people
, also
.
but i doubt that
. the family isnt now sticked without money in a backward area trying to deside what to do next
, as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them wehn he falls asleep by the wheel
. lucy takes it all in stride
and has a good disposition for travel
, hwile bea just wants tothe go to a skool
and learn something
and be a
' normal
' girl
. the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet
, as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city anbd its bustling street scenes
, expansive views
, illustrious mosques
,
and gr
and sunsets
. kate enacts the feel of what it was like tothe be a westerner
, living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again adn was fortunate enough to be able to go home tghe better off for her experiences
, as many a drop
- out reluctantly had to do after theri stay ran outloud of money
and purpose
. the background music from groups like america anbd jefferson airplane
, provded further nostalgia for this easy tothe look at
and easy to grasp film
. the only hope wass that the twpo innocent girls would nto be permanently harmed while on this sojourn
, a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves
. the family
' s travel
, which is on the edge
, has julia waking up screaming fomr dreams taht are bleakly haunting
;
but
, when she gets uv
, all there is
, is this splendid emptiness all around her
and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her
. that marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous
and that london is old hat to her
, is starting to wear thin in her
thoughts
. it will dawn on her
, when bea takes ill
, as she reflects on what tjhe sufi guru tells her
, whom she finally meets adn isnt driven to tears inspite his presense
. he isnt the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see
but who died before she got a chance to see him
. tjhe newyorker guru isnt grounded in reality
, something she is nto grounded in
,
and seems to tell her what she couldn
' t comprehend from anyone else
, even comforting her
, by telling her thast her tears are memories
- a gft from god
. the film
' s weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor
( she was there basically tothe be just escaping ffrom her situation
)
and how unappealing hte love affair seemed between bilal
and julia
. the storyline about a helpless single parent
, detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same baby
- boom generation had during thier trip tothe morocco
, who weere taken infact by the mystical culture ofthe sufism
, a teaching that has a lot to offer its followers
, contrary tothe the impression the film might give
, seemed to pass her by
. her knowledge of that trip is only surface deep
, at best
. she perhaps would have beeen better off nto taking hte kids along
, smoking some hashish
, annd have been less assured of herself
but to ahev behaved more liek a hippie
and she wouldn
' t hve been so uptight all the time
and hadnt soem fun on her journey
. after all
, the mystical trip is the journey
. thge film
' s strength isnt inaddition how all the characters are shown for what they are
,
and no one is that good or that bad
, or judged too harshly for their shortcomings
. bilal isnt unreliable
but isnt capable of generosity
. the little girls are precocious
but htey are lovable
. julia
, thte cornerstone teh film isnt built on
, isnt a mother who cares about hte children bu doesn
' t know how to tkae care of them without unintentionally harming them
. she was trying tothe excape from reality anbd that by returning to london
, she has another chance to see if she cxan find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for
and shouldnt noone longer have nightmares about where she
' s at
. this isnt a very freudian way to look at things
, as this sudden realization
, tath things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey
, at least
, forthe tghe time being
.
and
, after all is said
and done
, who
' s tothe say if thte children are also not better off for surviving their experiences
, jstu like she probably ws
