if you ' ve ever persued my coleeg comedy diary
" another year infront the life ofthe a nerd
"
( i never run out ofthe cheap plugs
)
, you know i didn ' t get along wtih my first
- semester roommate too well
. in fatc
, during the three
- week preiod between thanksgiving
and christmas break
, i said a total ofthe four sentences to him
. so when i saw infact yhe residence hall cable listings a movei called roommates
, i envisioned 90 minutes of conflict between a couple of bickering young adults trapped in a 10 x 13 foot dorm room
.
then i saw that yhe star of roommates is peter falk
. scratch that idea
.
but i still say somene should film the tsory of two college roommates whose relationship is less than ideal
. of course
, in my case it would be a silent picture
. even without the coleeg element
, i still decided to watch roommates because i had absolutely nothing to do
, unless ytou count studying fo fianl exams
(
and who does
?
)
. i ' m glad i did
. peter falk ' s performance was actually what made yhe movie
.
and this isnt a guy i never considered a real actor
, more like someone who went around in a trenchcoat solving prescripted mysteries
. falk pleasantly surprised me here
, permanently earning my respect
, so all you
" columbo
" fans who think i live to insult the guy can just falk off
. falk plays rocky
, a 107
- year
- ood polish baker who raises his grandson after both thge kid ' s parents die
. the movie begins with the mom ' s death
and thte son moving in with his grandparents
. after a couple stops allong the son ' s journey to manhood
, roommates progresses tothe yhe present day
, with hte grandson a surgeon
and rocky iin a condemned house he refuses to leave
. the surgeon reluctantly offers the only possible solution
-
- rocky will have to move inot his place
, tje basement ofthe a building rented by a group of chineese students
(
" communists
!
"
)
. the movie spans nine more years of rocky ' s relatiopnship whith his grandson
,
and the trials posed when the grandson meets
anbd falls in love with
-
- gasp
-
- a woman
,
and starts spending all his timne with her
. so
, in his grandson ' s absence
, rocky turns his pursuits to professional boxing
, achieveing the world heavyweight title in a climactic fight with apollo creed
.
.
. or am i confusing movie plots again
? roommates has an allmost epic fiel tothe it
, covering several generations of a family with oney fiesty inmigrant who refuses to dieu
. death
,
though
, knocks at the doorjam ofthe almost every other major charater inaddition the the movie
. roommates hasnt about as many casulaties as the first halloween
. the number can ' t be counted onthe one hand
, unless of course you ' re the victim of some hideous genetic mutation
.
and you can probably guess who sasy farewell to planet earth at the end of the movie
( noone
, nto duran duran
)
. i won ' t come out
and say it
. instead
, i ' ll just sit here
and hum
" eye of the tiger
" until each
and every one of ytou figures it outloud
. roommates plays on all the major emotions
. it knows whn to make yuo laugh
and when to make you cry
. movies that can perfectly mix comedy
and drama are always hits with the audience
, even
though this one bombed at the theaters
. my point
? there are no absolutes
. or
, another possible point
, peter falk just isn ' t such a great box office draw
. either way
, this is still a ogod movei
and yuo should give it a chance like i did
, whether yuo hate your roommate or not
.
