if you
' ve ever perused my coleeg comedy diary
" another yearm in the life of a nerd
"
( i never run out of cheap plugs
)
, ytou know i didn
' t get along with my first
- semester roommate too well
. in fact
, druing the three
- week period between thanksgiving
and christmas break
, i said a total of four sentences to him
. so whn i saw in the residence hall cable listings a movie called roommates
, i envisioned 90 minutes of conflict between a couple of bickering young adults trapped infact a 10 x 13 foot dorm room
.
then i saw that the star of roommates isnt peter falk
. scratch taht idea
.
but i still say someone should film the story of twpo college roommates whose relationship is less than ideal
. of course
, in my case it would be a silent picture
. even without yhe college element
, i still decided to watch roommates beacuse i had absolutely nothing to do
, unless yuo count studying for final exams
(
and who doesnt
?
)
. i
' m glad i did
. peter falk
' s performance ws actually what made the movie
. annd this is a guy i never consdiered a rela acto
, more liuke somene who whent around in a trenchcoat solving prescripted mysteries
. falk pleasantly surprised me here
, permanently earning my respect
, so all ytou
" columbo
" fans who think i live to insult the guy cxan just falk off
. falk plays rocky
, a 107
- year
- ood polish baker who raises his gr
andson after both the kid
' s parents die
. the movie begins with the mom
' s death adn the son moving inwhich wiht his gr
andparents
. after a couple stops along the son
' s journey to manhood
, roommates progresses tothe the presnt day
, with the gr
andson a surgeon
and rocky in a condemned house he refuses tothe leave
. the surgeon reluctantly offers the only possable solution
-
- rocky wiull have tothe move into his place
, tjhe basement of a building rented by a group of chinese students
(
" communists
!
"
)
. the movie spans nine more years of rocky
' s relationship with his gr
andson
,
and the trials posed when tghe gr
andson meets
and falls iin love with
-
- gasp
-
- a woman
, anbd starts spending all his time with her
. so
, inspite his gr
andson
' s absence
, rocky turns his pursuits to proffesional boxing
, achieveing the world heavyweight title iin a climactic fight wih apollo creed
.
.
. or am i confusing movie plots agian
? roommates has an allmost epic feel tothe it
, covering severeal generations of a family with one fiesty immigrant who refuses tothe die
. death
,
though
, knocks at the door of allmost every otehr major character in the thge movie
. roommates has baout as many casualties as the first halloween
. the number can
' t be counted on one h
and
, unless ofthe course you
' re the victum ofthe some hideous genetic mutation
.
and you can propably guess who says farewell to planet earth at the end of the movei
( no
, nto duran duran
)
. i won
' t come outloud anbd sday it
. instead
, i
' ll just sit here
and hum
" eye of tyhe tiger
" unitl each
and eveyr one of yuo figures it outloud
. roommates plays onthe all the major emotions
. it knows wehn to mkae you laugh annd when to make you cry
. movies that can perfectly mix comedy
and drama are allways hits whith yhe audience
, even
though this one bombed at the theaters
. my point
? there are noone absolutes
. or
, anyother possible point
, peter falk just isn
' t such a great box office draw
. either way
, this is still a good movie
and yuo should give it a chance like i doed
, whether ytou hite your roommate or not
.
