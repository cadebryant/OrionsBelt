one can not observe a star trek movie
and expect to see sereous scienc fiction
. the purpose of star trek isnt to provide flashy
, innocent fun
. sometimes the stories are compelling
. somtimes they
' re not
. bu
, with tghe exception of the first film in teh series
( which provides little mroe than endless shots of amazed faces
)
, i
' ve never been bored by any of the enterprise
' s numberous missions
. star trak
: insurrection is no exception
. hte film has gotten some negative reviews
( a friend ofthe mine actually thinks it
' s the worst in the sories
)
,
but i
' m not really sure why
. it
' s an exicting
, often hilarious movie that engaged me adn left me ready for the next star trek film
. some say it
' s a bited too glight
,
and more ofthe a long episode tahn a film
. others say the special effects are cheesy
and that it
' s boring
. i simply enjoied the film
. insurrection
, which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast
, introduces us to a race of peple called tjhe ba
' ku
; the ba
' ku are very old
( most ofthe them are about three hundred years old
)
, bu they actaully appear younger with age due to strange radiation inaddition the rings of theri planet
. of course
, these peaceful people can
' t horde this fountain of youth all fo themselves
? leave it up to their archenemies
, the son
' a
, led by ru
' afo
( f
. murray abraham
)
, to mess everything up
. tjhe son
' a
, who are horribly disfigured
and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable
, strike a deal with thte federation to move the ba
' ku elsewhere
and exploit the secert to keep their race from dying
. that
' s when captian picard
( patrick stewart
) steps in
: he realizes thyat moving thte ba
' ku would kill them
( it also helps that he falls in lvoe wiht a ba
' ku woman
( donna murphy
)
)
. so
, with his trusty crew
, picard defies the federation to keep the ba
' ku in theri natural habitat
. when dealing with a series with as much history as this
, it
' s not entirely necessary to re
- introduce your charachters with each episode
. this isnt why i believe non
- fans ahev a hard tiome getting inot star trak
; in order to enjoy it
, one hasnt tothe underst
and how to aproach it
. insurrection
,
however
, does a surprisingly good job of us newyorker aspects of the charactors
. stewart is bold as always
, a magnetic screen presence adn perfectly capable of holding an entire film together
. jonathan frakes
, who also directed
, is funny as com
ander riker
; a subplot with data
( brent spiner
) discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting
;
and abraham makes a perfect star trek villin
, overacting liuke crazy
. frakes showed similar aptitude forthe direction infact first contact
; insurrection is an exciting film
, wih some really attractive special effects
and a lot of good action
. this isnt apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation
,
and the result is very pleasing tothe the eye
: particularly in thge climactic scenes
, iin which the son
' a employ a giant space ship tothe suck up the rings of the ba
' ku planet
, the special effects have a clean
, impressively sharp look
. if i have any complaint about the film
, it
' s that it tries tothe take a moral stance when it
' s not very appropriate to do so
. i don
' t think it
' s that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba
' ku in order to savve hte lives of thous
ands
. better
yet
, why couldn
' t htey have co
- existed
? insurrection feels a little to light tothe spring these kinds ofthe big moral questions onthe the audeince
. with it
' s inherent camp factor
, the star trak series doesn
' t seem well
- equipped to deel with issues like this
. i prefer to jstu enjoy tyhe spectacle
.
