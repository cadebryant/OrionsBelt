one can not observe a star trek movie
annd expect to see serious science fiction
. the purpose of star trak is to provide flashy
, innocent fun
. somtimes the stories are compelling
. sometimes they ' re nto
.
bu
, with the exception ofthe the first film in teh series
( which provides little mroe than endless shots of amazed faces
)
, i ' ve never beeen borde by any ofthe the enterprise ' s numerous missions
. star trek
: insurrection is noone exception
. tyhe film has gotten smoe negitive reviews
( a friend of mine actually thinks it ' s the worst in the series
)
,
but i ' m not really sure why
. it ' s an exciting
, often hillarious movie that engaged me
and left me ready for the next star trak film
. some say it ' s a bit too light
,
and omre of a long episode than a film
. others say the spacial effects are cheesy
and that it ' s boring
. i simply enjoied the film
. insurrection
, whitch is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast
, introduces us to a race of people called the ba ' ku
; the ba ' ku are vyre ood
( most of them are about three hundered years ood
)
,
but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings ofthe their planet
. of course
, these peaceful people cant ' t horde this fountain of youth all for themselves
? leave it up to their archenemies
, the son ' a
, led by ru ' afo
( f
. murray abraham
)
, to mess everything up
. the son ' a
, who are horribly disfigured
annd rely on daily reconstructive surgery tothe be aesthetically preventative
, strike a deal iwth the federation tothe move the ba ' ku elsewhere
and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying
. thta ' s when captain picard
( patrick stewart
) steps in
: he realizes tath moving hte ba ' ku would kill them
( it allso helps thta he falls in love wih a ba ' ku woman
( donna murphy
)
)
. so
, withthe his trusty crew
, picard defies the federation tothe keep the ba ' ku in their naturual habitat
. when dealing with a serieses with as much history as this
, it ' s not entirely neccessary to re
- inctroduce your characters with each episode
. tihs isnt why i believe non
- fans have a hard time getting into star trek
; inthe order to enjoy it
, one has to understand how to aproach it
. insurrection
,
however
, does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the charactors
. stewart is bold as always
, a magentic screen presense
and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together
. jonathan frakes
, who also directed
, is funny as comander riker
; a subplot with data
( brent spiner
) dicovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting
;
and abraham makes a perfect star trak villain
, overacting like crazy
. frakes showed similar aptitude for direction infact first contact
; insurrection is an exciting film
, with some really attractive special effects
and a lot of ogod action
. this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize coputer animation
,
anbd the result is veyr pleasing to the eye
: particularly in tyhe climactic scenes
, in which hte son ' a employ a giant space ship to suck up thge rings of the ba ' ku planet
, the special effects haev a clean
, impressively sharp look
. if i have any complaint baout tjhe film
, it ' s that it tries to take a moral stance when it ' s nto very appropriate tothe do so
. i don ' t think it ' s that big of a deal that the federation wnated to move 600 ba ' ku in order to save the lives ofthe thousands
. better
yet
, why couldn ' t they have co
- existed
? insurrection fiels a little to light to spring theese kinds of big moral questions on the audience
. with it ' s inherent camp factor
, tghe star trak series doesn ' t seem well
- equiped to deal with issues liuke this
. i preferr to jstu enjoy tghe spectacle
