i recall thte trials
and tribulations of my high school years
. it was a preiod that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood
and thrust me into the unwelcome arms ofthe adulthood
.
but ofthe all the experiences that i collected throughout those tender years
, i cxan honestly sday that the toughest
and tghe scariest thing that i hadnt to coppe with was my raging hormones
and my crazed curiosity baout girls
and sex
. yes
, more scarier than my seventh grade english teacher anbd even scarier than thge bullies tht constantly hounded me
, trying to deal wiht my personal wonderment baout sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster
. for all teenagers
, it
' s alomst like a rite of passage
.
and wqat we doed was sometimes downright nasty
, somtimes funny
, anbd somtimes shocking
.
and all ofthe tath isnt terrifically
and shamelessly brought to light in what might be the funniest movie thsi summer
.
` american pie
' is a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that enter into a pact to lose their virginity by the end ofthe the skool eyar
. just how great are their hormones raging
? oen of them notes
, after watching disney
' s teh little mermaid
, that ariel is soooo hot
. the four schoolmates are kevin
, oz
, finch
and jim
. kevin is the onyl one wih a steady girlfriend
,
but doesn
' t want to have sex untl tghe time is just right
. bu what is the perfect time
? there is just no way tothe know
,
and that frightens him
. oz isnt the big jock who decides that the way to score with the girls is to listen to them
and to be more sensitive
. he joins up with a jazz choir
and discovers taht getting in touch with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages
. finch is the phobic hermit who doesn
' t st
and a chance wiht any girl
. so
, he pays someone
$ 200 tothe start spreading rumors about his prowess
. suddenly
, girls are lining up to go out with him
.
but among theese friends
, it isnt jim that is hte most curious
and the most fearful
. when he has a chance tothe romp with a pretty exchange student
, his inexperience comes shining through
. he has much tothe learn
,
and will do anything tothe seek out this kind of knowledge
. tihs may inlude watching scrambled porn channels or experimenting with mom
' s aple py inspite a scene that isnt completely shocking
, raunchy
,
yet unbelievably funny
. the one thing tht i want to say baout htis film is that it well deserves its
` r
' rating
. there is stuff in here that isnt completely gross in the same manner that
` there
' s something about mary
' ws gloriously ribald
. in fact
, at first this film recieved a sinful nc
- 17 rating before a couple ofthe more cuts finaly brought it down to a teen
- accessible rating
.
but i guess after seeing the no
- holds
- barred coarseness ofthe sourth park
, this seems tame by comparison
. teens anbd anyone who can still rember their acne years are tje ones thgat will laugh hardest
.
but unlike many teen sex comedies
, there is a genuine intelligence at work here
. these are four normal boys who have a natrual curiosity about sex
. their plans of action are
thoughtful anbd they think baout the consequences
. they know what tehy want
,
yet temper it with responibility
.
but almost always
, it
' s impossible to know how to fight the invisible monster
,
and it
' s these epidsodes that make
` american pie
' such a carnal delight to watch
.
