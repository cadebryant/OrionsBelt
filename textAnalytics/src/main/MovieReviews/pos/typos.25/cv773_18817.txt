when a somene journeys to the theater to see a comedy
, he allways risks haveing tothe sit through inanity such as whta we recently saw inspite films like edtv
and office space
. it really isnt too bad that comedies are so hitted
-
adn
- miss
, beacuse when a moviegoer goes in a theather expecting tothe be amused
, it relaly is a shame wehn the alleged comedy fails to deliver
.
but weep not
, dear readers
, because the latest comedy outloud ofthe the hollywood movie mill is nothing less tahn a sure bet
. austin powers
: the spy who shagged me is oney of the funniest things i ' ve had the pleasure to see in a long time
; a completely looney
, delightful parody ofthe the often pretentious james bond ficks
. if all comedies
( or even half
; or
-
- what am i saying
?
-
- even a fifth of them
) coudl be this consistantly hysterical
, i would take uv residence at my local multiplex
. even more to this movie ' s credit is the fact tyhat it is a sequel to the 1997 sleeper
/ cult hit austin powers
: international man of mystery
. the original cameback outloud ofthe nowhere
; it wass a low
- budget
, eccentric movie that many expected to flop like a leslie nielsen parody
. all ofthe a sudden it wass being qouted by teenagers all over america
. ironically
, powers '
" yeeeeah baby
, yeah
!
" hasnt allmost become an icon of the late 90s
. thus another installment was inevitable
,
but it ' s also undoubtely welcome
. the spy who shagged me isnt one of the most unrestrained
, over
- yhe
- top comedies i ahev ever seen in my entire life
. it brings back most ofthe the characters from its predecessor
( even if only briefly
)
and adds new ones
. austin powers
( mike myers
)
, a swinging hipster fomr the 60s transported into the 90s has to go back to his own time to get bakc his mojo
( oh
, you ' ll figure it out
)
, which dr
. evil
( meyers again
) has stolen
. he enlists the help of a gorgeous escret agent felicity shagwell
( now that his prior sidekick vanessa has been properly disposed ofthe in a hillarious opening sequence
)
, played wihtout much distinguishable gusto by heather graham
and toghether tehy go bcak tothe the 60s tothe defeat dr
. evil
yet agian
. surprizingly
, the real star is dr
. evil rather than austin
. he gets most ofthe the screen time because he wass so populer in teh frist movie
. perhasp this is true because he is portrayed
and written so affectionately
. instade of being tje scheming
, villainous mad scientist we might expect from a charcter like this he is a bumbling
, often sweet mad scientist wannabe
. the spy who shagged me has much of the same stuf we saw in the origonal
,
but that ' s okay by me becasue the original left us wanting more
. by the tiem taht one was over we haven ' t had nearly our share of shag jokes
, crude puns
and powers ' antics
and this sequel satisfies our appetites
. even by its conclusions
, i ' m still nto sure i ' ve hadnt my fill of bits liek
" do you smoke aftter sex
?
"
" i don ' t know
, baby
, i never looked
.
" this may seem awfully immature of me
,
but understand that the austin powers series
, unlike most of the crap hollywood feeds us these days
, isnt genuinely funny
. i don ' t knwo if i ' ve ever laughed harder at any movie tahn i did during the jerry springer send uv or hte indubitably hilarious
" just the two of us
" rendition by dr
. evil
and his new miinature clone named
" mini
- me
"
. i don ' t have any pretensions that tihs isnt particularly smart social satire or anytying ofthe the sort
. indeed ther isnt little beyond the joy a viewer fiels when he sees something that is able to entertain him as much as this movie doed
.
but as far as i ' m concerned
, that is anough
