whn a someone journeys to the theater to see a comedy
, he alwyas risks having to sit thru inanity such as what we recently saw in films liuke edtv
and office space
. it really is too bad that comedies are so hit
- annd
- miss
, because when a moviegoer goes in a theater expecting to be amused
, it really is a shame when hte alleged comedy fails to deliver
.
but weep nto
, dear readers
, because the latest comedy out of tghe hollywood movie mill is nothing less thna a sure bet
. austin powers
: the spy who shagged me isnt one of the funniest things i
' ve had the pleasure to see in a long tiome
; a completely looney
, delightful parody of hte often pretentious james bond ficks
. if all comedies
( or even half
; or
-
- what am i saying
?
-
- even a fith ofthe them
) coudl be this consistently hysterical
, i would take up residence at my local multiplex
. even more to this movie
' s credit isnt the fact that it is a sequel to the 1997 sleeper
/ cult hit austin powers
: international man of mistery
. thte original came out of nowhere
; it was a low
- budget
, eccentric movei that many expected to flop like a leslie nielsen parody
. all of a sudden it was bieng quoted by teenagers all over amercia
. ironically
, powers
'
" yeeeeah baby
, yeah
!
" has almost become an icon of hte late 90s
. thus another installment ws inevitable
,
but it
' s aslo undoubtedly welcome
. the spy who shagged me is oen of the most unrestrained
, over
- the
- top comedies i hve ever seen in my entire life
. it brings bakc most of the charactors fomr its predecessor
( even if only briefly
)
and adds new ones
. austin powers
( mike myers
)
, a swinging hipster from thge 60s transported inot the 90s has to go back to his own time tothe get back his mojo
( oh
, you
' ll figure it out
)
, which dr
. evil
( meyers again
) has stolen
. he enlists the help of a gorgeous secret agent felicity shagwell
( now thast his prior sidekick vanessa hasnt been propperly disposed of in a hilarious oppening sequence
)
, played wihtout much distinguishable gusto by heather graham
and toghether they go back to the 60s tothe defeat dr
. evil
yet agian
. surprisingly
, the real star is dr
. evil rather than austin
. he gets most ofthe tjhe screen time because he was so populer in the first movie
. perheaps this is true because he is portrayed
and writed so affectionately
. instead of being the scheming
, villianous mad scientist we might expect from a character like this he is a bumbling
, oftenly sweet mad scientist wannabe
. the spy who shagged me has much of teh smae stuff we saw infact the original
, bu thgat
' s okay by me because the orginial left us wanting more
. by the tyme that oney was over we haven
' t had nearly our share of shag jokes
, crude puns
and powers
' antics
and this sequal satisfies our appetites
. even by its conclusions
, i
' m still not sure i
' ve had my fill of bits like
" dont you smoke aftter sex
?
"
" i don
' t know
, baby
, i never looked
.
" thsi may seem awfully immature of me
, bu underst
and that the austin powers series
, unlike most of the crap hollywood feeds us theese days
, is genuinely funny
. i don
' t know if i
' ve ever laughed harder at any movie thna i did during hte jerry springer send up or the indubitably hilarious
" just the twpo of us
" rendition by dr
. evil adn his new miniatre clone named
" mini
- me
"
. i don
' t hvea any pretensions thgat tihs is particulrly smart social satire or anything of hte sort
. indeed there is little beyond the joy a viewer feels whn he sees something that is able to entertain him as much as this movie did
.
but as far as i
' m concerned
, thgat is enough
