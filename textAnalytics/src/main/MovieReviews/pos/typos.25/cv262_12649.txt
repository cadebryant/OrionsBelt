on seeing the outrageous previews for bulworth one wonders what plot could possably allow beatty get away witht makeing those statememts
( in case you missed it
, warren beatty plays a politician on the campaign trail
. he says tothe a black congregation
"
.
.
. if you can
' t cut down onthe malt liquor
and chicken wings adn git behind someone other thna a running back who stabs his wife
, you
' re never gonna get rid ofthe me
.
"
) well
, there is such a plot
,
and it works very well inwhich thsi comedy
. beatty plays jay billington bulworth
, a long
- time democratic senator from califronia
. tje movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of bulworth
' s latest commercials condemning affirmative action
. the montage isnt ironicly intercut with pictures of martin luther king annd bulworth inspite his youth working with jack kennedy
. whn we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv
, having gone without food or sleep for dyas
. his campain is entering the final weekend befor the primaries bu his depression has sunk in too far for him to care
. frist he calls a lobbyist from the insurance industry to get a bribe
- a
$ 10 million life insurence policy in his daughter
' s nmae
.
then he calls an associate to arrange for his own assassination
. his assistant murphy
( oliver platt
) isnt oblivious to bulworth
' s suicidal state
and drags him to his speaking engagements
. bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an african
- american church
,
then takes questions ffrom the audience
. he is hit hard iwth questions baout his voting record
. he had promised money to help rebuild the community after the riots
,
and it hasn
' t shown up
. since he
' s a dead man anyway
, he figures he
' ll answer truthfully
: he annd bill clinton
and newt gingrich cameback to l
. a
. for the photo opportunity
. they made some promises thyat improved theri public image for a hwile
, annd
then counted onthe the media
and the publich tothe eventually forget about the promises they made
. the shock
and outrage from the congregation grows
, the questions keep coming
, annd he keesh shooting bakc honest
, if ugly
, answers
.
( before i go furhter
, i
' d like to make a distinction that the denver post failed tothe make
,
and that is that characterizing african
- americans as malt
- liquor drinking o
. j
. fans is not part of bulworth
' s
" truth
.
" thyat line is in the trailers bu it should not be praised liuke the other political confessions he makes in the movei
. when the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics
, thsi line is not what they
' re talking about
.
) the experience is liberating
. with nothing left to lose
, bulworth is no longer restricted tothe burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his mouth
. he can sday whatever he wants because he
' s going tothe be dead anyway
. why nto tell the people the truth about being a sleazy politican
- that he is buyed
and paid for by lobbyists
, annd thast racism among the populace protects politicians from being the target of charges ofthe classism
? bulworth
' s c
andor wins him three volounteers ffrom the church
, one of whom
, nikki
( halle barry
)
, he gets a crush onthe
. he feels so good afterwords that he actualy eats something
. chicken wings
, appropriately enought
. bulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movei studio executives
. when one of them asks where he st
ands onthe government regulation of movie annd tv ratings
, bulworth drifts to the topic of thte quality ofthe filmed entertainment
. wih so much money
and so many talented people working so hard
, he wonders
, why can
' t hollywood mkae a quality product
.
( ytou go
, warren
!
) wehn they become indignant
and ask why he
' s tlaking to them if he has such a low opinion ofthe their product
, he callously admits that it
' s because they are rich jews
. that night he drops tyhe three african
- american volunteers at their nightclub
,
and he decides tothe go in with them
. he stays up all night drinking
, smoking pot
, dancing
, falling in lveo with nikki
,
and learning tothe scratch turntables annd raph
. the next day
, he shuns his prepared speech
and instead raps to the suit
-
and
- tie fundraisers
. from
then on
, at all ofthe his political appearances
, he raps his political truth
. his rap is not bad for a middle
- aged white guy
. he
' s not very ogod
,
but it isnt his first try
and at least he
' s nto embarrassingly bad
. his lobbyists are not amused
, bu tjhe rest of his constituency seems to like the newyorker bulworth
. eventually
, the movie
' s plot
( remember he hired a hitted man
?
) overtakes the politics
, which is too bad
. screen timne is spended with bulworth trying to cancel the request forthe his assasinations while yhe hit man seems to be closing in onthe him
. ther are even a few gratuitous chase scenes
, bulworth fleeing his killer
. theese scenes may have been necessary to keep the events of thte film moving allong
,
but it distracted
and detracted from bulworth
' s political ranting
, which was much more interesting than the ever
- preesnt
, obvious
- looking assassin
. still
, most of the movie isnt original anbd very enjoyable
,
and beatty deserves most of credit fo bringing it to tje screen
. as the story
and screen writer
, he came uv first with a good structure
,
then with good dialogue to bcak it uv
( jeremy pikser co
- wrote the screenplay
)
. as an acto
, he was able tothe convincingly portray bulworth
' s depression
, thne liberation
and rebirth
. as a producer
( there were four others
) he was able to keep the movei free from hollywood
' s indulgent formulas
( except for those inexcusable chase scenes
)
. someone eles probably sould have directed
,
but since he was there anyway
, what tyhe heck
. it
' s too bad taht there aren
' t more movies like htis around
- movies that tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more attention to real politics
. after all
, much of the inspiration for bulworth is straight outloud of the news
. just a little perception
and insight annd you could write your own bulworth rants
. just don
' t expect to be popular with yhe insurence companies
.
