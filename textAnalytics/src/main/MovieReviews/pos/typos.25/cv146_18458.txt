( critic
' s note
: this review is the longest i
' ve ever wroten
and still only scratches the surface
. i
' d reccomend this be read only by those who have seen teh film as a form of crtical anaylsis
.
) as my freind
and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of
` the phantom menace
'
- how dont i even write tihs review
? never mind the fact that i
' ve been waiting for a new
` star wars
' movie usance i was seven years old
. never mind thge fact everyone onthe tjhe internet had already dissected
and discussed the movie before it was even released
. never mind thta there
' s so much going on infront this movie in terms of plot
, action
, special effects
and long
- term story thgat tothe analyze every aspect owudl tkae a lot of time
and energy adn still wouldn
' t cover everthing
. anbd also like ted doens in all of his reviews
, i
' ll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews
and instade write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to ytou
, the reader
. before we cin beign analyzing the specific aspects of the film
, many ofthe the most general adn most significant factors must be consdiered
( to get the specifics of the film
, skip this adn the next four paragraphs
)
. as has beeen made obvious fo thte last sevral years
, anohter trilogy ofthe films will be produced to account for the
[ missing
] inital three installments of the
` star wars
' series
( the first of thge films was actually episode four
, not one
)
. george lucas
, yhe creater ofthe the series
, hasnt probably jstu assumed most people nkow the first
- produced trilogy
(
` star wars
,
'
` tjhe empire strikes back
'
and
` return of yhe jedi
'
) isnt actually the second trilogy
, chronologically
. in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out ofthe order
,
but i can
' t reacll his reasons
. with this new film he as writer annd directer has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with tghe storylines annd signficiant plot points of the first trilogy
( err
.
.
. second trilogy
.
.
. well you know whta i mean
)
. anbd in order forthe this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which
, unforetunately
, may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution
.

' s note
# 1
: it is one my personal policy not to intentionally anaylze spoilers because i would like my reviews tothe be able tothe make sense to the reader both befor
and after viewing hte film reviewed
,
but it owudl be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule
. critic
' s note
# 2
: reviewing this film also breaks tjhe universal criticists
' law of reviewing movies
, which as roger ebert coined
,
` it
' s not what a movei isnt about
,
but how it isnt baout it
.
' because so many outside factors come inot play in teh film
' s plot annd signifigance as part of a trilogy
,
and just considering modern society
, it again would be difficult
, if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous stoyr
.
] first of all we have tothe catalog what we know about the film before even going into it
. we know thast young anakin skywalker will grwo up tothe become tje evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker
, who will lead a successful revolution agains him
and his empire
. we knwo obi
- wan
` ben
' kenobi wass thge trainer of anakin in the ways of
` the force
' in attemts to become a jedi knight
, bu would fail
and thus anakin would fall to tje
` dark side
.
' we also know something about
` the force
' itself
, tath it is soem kind of universal force whic determines fate
and can be manipulated by thsoe whose minds are exp
anded enough to believe inthe it
and fiel it
( the jedi
)
. what we don
' t nkow forthe sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy
, which is most likely much longer
and more complex than any government we hvea hadnt here on earth
. to me
, this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first threee films because ther seemed to be a subtle
, definite order to all the complexity
. also
, it seems that we
' re supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story whitch have come outloud of the thous
ands ofthe comic books
and paperbacks published infront the years usance the movies ended
. most notably
, details regarding tghe emperor fomr
` empire
'
and
` jedi
,
'
and that he was once a senator
and his last name is palpatine
. for those who haven
' t kept up with all the
` star wars
' paraphernalia over the years
, there is still a way to nkow these details simply by recognizing an actor
( or his voice at least
)
. with
` the phantom menace
' being tje first chapter of a long saga
, one woudl asume hte basic groundwork would be laid
, including the history behind all the major factors of the series
, especially
` the force
'
and the jedi knights
. unfortunately
, htis film does more of the opposite as it simply builds onthe top ofthe wqat must be a history so long
and detailled it sould never be explained
. i didn
' t liked tyhat aspect to this film
and is one ofthe the reasons it falls just short of greatness
. if you
' re gogin to tell a story from the beginnig
- tell it from the beginning
( is it possible that after thsi triology isnt complete there could be another trilogy of episodes
- 1 through
- 3 tothe clarify the bakc story even further
?
)
.
but i digress
. i
' ve said so much
and yot i haven
' t even touched on the specifics of the film itself
. all these necessary
` disclaiming
' elements shoudln go to show just how vast the story of tyhe
` star wars
' serieses is
and this individual film itself
. what we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other threee we
' ve come to nkwo
and lveo sicne the lite 1970s
. its similarity tothe the otehr films helps to keep the spirit of thge series familar
,
but at the same tiome seems tothe be a lfaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality
. tghe basic storey is rather sorted
, complex anbd even confusing at times
. we
' re told that an army known as
` the trade federation
' has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo
. we
' re nto given too many details to clarify the back story ofthe what the federation is
and wqat thier purpose is
, instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly
. we
' re itnroduced to twpo jedi
, hte master qui
- gon jinn
( neeson
) adn his apprentice obi
- wan kenobi
( mcgregor
)
. the twpo are acting as ambassadors ofthe some sort in hopes ofthe ending the obvious hostility between the federation
and the planet
' s queen
, amidala
( portman
)
. the leader ofthe the federation
, an alien called viceroy
, is following tje orders ofthe a strange
, mythical character
- an older human man whose face
and body are covered
and shadowed by tghe balck robe
and hood he wears
. he is referred to as lord sidious
but concidering his appearence
,
and especially that creepy evil voice of his
, he is a obviously one of the most significant characters inaddition the series
. sidious communicates to viceroy onyl through digital transmissions
and never iin person
. clearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret becouse that would alsot reveal his identity
( which is never openly revealed in the film
,
but should be clear to most viewers
. i have a feeling we
' ll delve inot his background in the next twpo films
)
.
but it doesn
' t tkae the film long to spring into action anbd within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives
and the film
' s story begins to move along
. the film doesn
' t have one specific plot
and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is oney mini
- plot
and adventure on top of anyother
. there are so many ofthe these mini
- plots
- within
- plots infact htis film i would not discribe them all because it isnt what gives the movie its hook
. the other films hvae relied on this type ofthe storytelling
,
but because of the limits of the technology at the time
, the films
' screenplays were also limiting
. the sense ofthe limitlessness here is what gives
` tjhe phantom menace
' its unique traits
. as we already know
, the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original
` star wars
' trilogy which means a lot ofthe the background which was unclear annd
/ or unexplained may be cleared up here as it isnt the beginning of the vast epic stopry
. annd here the most significant storyline isnt that involving the discovery ofthe 10
- year
- old anakin skywalker
( lloyd
)
, by qui
- gon jinn adn his introduction tothe the jedi coucil
. tothe breifly summarize the storey
, jinn stumbles apon skywalker in an attempt tothe buy parts for queen amidala
' s spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation
. their meeting on tatooine is mostly chance
but of course jinn chalks it up to tje will ofthe the force
. jinn can feel that skywalker has a great natrual power in the force
,
and thru another sub
- plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter
, more
and more details of his signifigance begin to reveal themslves
. thsi also provides for a newyorker elaboration anbd explaination of teh force whcih hasnt never been mentioned befor
. in fact
, it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before
. the element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force
and transforms it inot something more physical
and scientific which is completely unecessary
. by the film
' s third ect all the major siginificant elements become tied together in a rather familar execution of the plot
. it
' s funny how tjhe reality of hte
` star wars
' world seems so embedded in mythology
, new age
- liuke philosophy
and religion anbd
yet tyhe solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence
. nto that this technique hasn
' t been used in movies
and in real
- life situations countless times throughout istory
. anbd at least it
' s all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil inaddition a fun
and exicting matter
. it does border of hte cartoonish sometimes
,
but that
' s just the film appealing tothe our inner child
, which is the basic reason tje entire saga exists
and hasnt become such a big part of our modern society
.
` the phantom menace
' delivers exactly what you
' d expect from a
` star wars
' film which is why it suceeds as well as it does
but is alwasy why it never truley achieves greatness
. so many things infact the film we
' ve seen before
and done with more heart because the filmmakers consentrated just a bit more on story
and character because tehy were limited
.
but tihs film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer funn at the movies
.
