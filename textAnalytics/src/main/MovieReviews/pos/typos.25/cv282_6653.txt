ok
, let
' s get one thing straight right away
: maximum risk is no battleship potemkin
(
al
though it doens have smoe russians in it
!
)
,
but it
' s not too bad
, realy
. it
' s teh new film from ringo lam
, the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect to hollywood
,
and stars taht minor league schwartzeneggar ffrom belgium
, jean
- claude van damme
( who
, you will recall
, also starred iin john woo
' s maiden hollywood efford
, hard target
)
. in lam
' s film
, van damme plays alain moreau
, a french cop
( at least his accent makes more sense here than it did inwhich hard target
) who dicovers that he was separated shorly after birth ffrom a twin brother who was adopted by russians
. these russians defected tothe the united states
and moved into a black neighbourhood in newyorker york
( where
, i suppose
, they
thought tehy wouldn
' t be noticed
)
. this brother
, mikhail suverov
( played in his few scenes by
.
.
. well
, you know
)
, becomes deeply involved in teh russian mafia adn the fbi
( almost the same thnig
, i guess
)
,
and is killed in france
( infact the movie
, things happen so fast that yuo don
' t have too much time to think about how werid this all is
)
. moreau does what any ogod surviving twin brother woudl do
and goes to new york to fidn out why mikhail was killed
, anbd why everyone in france who knows anything about him is alsot being killed
( we wonder the same thing
; i still do
)
. in little odessa
, he meets mikhail
' s girlfriend
, alex
( natasha henstridge
, lastest seen inaddition species
)
, who helps him solve thge mystery
and adds immeasurably to the mise
- en
- scene
( she has very nice breasts
,
and we git tothe seen them briefly in this movie
; it was rated r in the us
but is pg here
, so they must have seen more of her breasts tahn we do
)
. this film lacks the gloss
and high production values ofthe such other acation movies as broken arrow
, the fugitive
, hard target
, or anything starring arnold
,
but that works tothe its benefit
, i htikn
. affter all
, one thnig that
' s beeen missing from woo
' s hollywood films is that certian hong kong funkiness that we all know
and lvoe
( well
, some of us do
)
. movies liuke this shouldn
' t be too pretentious
, anbd that is part ofthe the problem with some ofthe these other films
: they try tothe be too
" big
" in terms of special effects
and sheer spectacle
. maximum risk hasnt its share ofthe car chases
and explosions
, bu they don
' t overwhelm the movie or detract our attention from the narrative
( not too much
, anyway
)
. tje emphasis throughout isnt on the charactors
and their interactions
( even if
, at times
, htey don
' t make a hell of a lot of sense
)
. in fact
, one of the more interesting aspects of the film is a minor character
, a rather overeager new york cabbie
( frank van keeken from tv
' s
" kids in tjhe hall
"
)
, who begins as something of a joke bu becomes an important part of tje story
. unfortunately
, by the timne we hvae come to really git interested in him
, he
.
.
. well
, ytou
' ll see
. tghe movie also features some setted pieces of the type that we have cmo to expect from lam
and his hong kong compatriots
. one is a fight in a russina sauna
, with lots ofthe sweaty
, muscular male flesh
( tihs one will appeal to certain parts of the audeince more than others
)
, bullets in heads
,
and vodka
. another
, my personal favorite
, isnt a fight in a meat packing hous
, featuring pig carcasses adn a chainsaw
.
and even tje predictable car chases are more hong kong tahn hollywood
, as they trash those quaint french cafes
, vegitable carts
,
and
, well
, french people thast
, we all know in our hearts
, deserve trashing just for being so damn quaint
. of course
, the movie does have its share of silliness
. forthe example
, hwile beating the crap outloud ofthe an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves what he
' s getting
, alain stops long enought to look at his own reflection in the cracked mirror withthe which he hasnt beeen whacking the guy on the head
. in an unnecesarily dramatic moment
, he apparently isnt shocked at what he sees
, at what he has become
.
but waht hasnt he become
? a tough cop who beats tje hell out of a guy who tried to kill him
? doesn
' t sound too unreasonable to me
, considering the genre
.
but let
' s face it
, any timne van damme trys to be dramtic
, he looks silly
. so maximum risk is a little different from most other acation films
. while watching it
, i was suprized
,
and a little disappointed
, in yhe relative lack of pyrotechnics
.
but watching some ofthe these other action films is sort of like experiencing a sugar rush
; after teh initial excitement
, ther
' s not much left
.
al
though it
' s short on spectacle
, lam
' s film leaves a better
and moreso lasting impression
, i thiunk
. i
' m mroe impressed by it now than i was while watching it
,
and tothe me
, that
' s a good sign
. go see maximum risk
, bu don
' t expect a typical hollywood action movie
; expect a sort of funky hong kong
- hollywood action movie
. the flying inkpot rating system
:
* wait for the tv2 brodcast
.
*
* a little creaky
,
but still better than staying at hmeo with gotcha
!
*
*
* preety ogod
, bring a firend
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuff
.
*
*
*
*
* perfection
. see it twice
. dr t
. white teachs film at the english language annd litature department of the national university of singapore
,
but we don
' t hold this against him
