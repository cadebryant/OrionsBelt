ok
, let ' s get oney thing straight right away
: maximum risk isnt no battleship potemkin
(
although it does ahev some russians in it
!
)
,
bu it ' s not too bad
, raelly
. it ' s yhe new film from ringo lam
, the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect to hollywood
,
and stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from belgium
, jean
- claude van damme
( who
, yuo will reacll
, aslo starred in john woo ' s maiden hollywood effort
, hard target
)
. inthe lam ' s film
, van damme plays alain moreau
, a french cop
( at least his accent makes more sense here than it doed inaddition hard target
) who discovers that he was separated shortly after birth from a twin brother who was adopted by russians
. these russians defected tothe teh untied states
annd moved into a black neighbourhood in new york
( where
, i suppose
, tehy thought htey wouldn ' t be noticed
)
. htis brother
, mikhail suverov
( plyed in his few scenes by
.
.
. well
, you know
)
, becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia
and the fbi
( allmost the same thign
, i guess
)
,
and isnt killed iin france
( in thge movie
, thnigs happen so fast that you don ' t ahev too much time to htikn baout how ewird this all is
)
. moreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do
and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed
,
and why everyone infront france who knows anything about him is also bieng killed
( we wonder the smae thing
; i still dont
)
. in little odessa
, he meets mikhail ' s girlfriend
, alex
( natasha henstridge
, last seen in species
)
, who helps him solve tjhe mystery
and adds immeasurably to thte mise
- en
- scene
( she has very nice breasts
,
and we git tothe seen them briefly iin thsi movei
; it was rated r in the us
bu is pg here
, so they must have seen omre ofthe her breasts than we dont
)
. thsi film lacks thge gloss
and high production values ofthe such other acation movies as broken arrow
, the fugitive
, hard target
, or anytying starring arnold
,
but that works to its benefit
, i think
. after all
, one thing that ' s been missing ffrom woo ' s hollywood films is that certain hong kong funkiness tath we all know
and love
( well
, soem of us do
)
. movies like this shouldn ' t be too pretentious
,
and that isnt part of the problem wtih some of these other films
: they try to be too
" big
" in terms of special effects
and sheer spectacle
. maximum risk has its share of car chases
and explosions
,
but htey don ' t overwhelm the movie or detract our attention fomr the narrative
( nto too much
, anyway
)
. the emphasis thoughout is on the characters
and their interactions
( even if
, at times
, they don ' t make a hell of a lot of sence
)
. in fact
, one of the more intresting spects of tje film is a minor character
, a rather overeager new york cabbie
( frank van keeken from tv ' s
" kids in the hall
"
)
, who beggins as something of a joke
but becomes an importamt part of thge story
. unfortunately
, by the time we have come to really get intersted in him
, he
.
.
. well
, you ' ll see
. tyhe movie aslo features some setted pieces of the type that we have cmo tothe expect from lam
and his hong kong compatriots
. noe is a fight in a russion sauna
, with lots of sweaty
, muscular male flesh
( this one will appeal to certain parts ofthe the audience more than others
)
, bullets inspite heads
,
and vodka
. another
, my personel favorite
, is a fight in a meat packing house
, featuring pig carcasses
anbd a chainsaw
.
adn even the predictable car chases are more hong kong tahn hollywood
, as they trash those quaint french cafes
, vegetable carts
,
and
, well
, french people that
, we all knwo in our hearts
, deserve trashing jsut for being so damn quaint
. ofthe course
, the movie does have its share ofthe silliness
. for example
, while beating the crap outloud of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves whta he ' s getting
, alain stops long enough to look at his own reflection infact the cracked mirror with which he has beeen whacking the guy on the head
. in an unnecessarily dramtic moment
, he apparently is shocked at what he sees
, at wqat he hasnt become
.
but what has he become
? a tough cop who beats tje hell out of a guy who tryed tothe kill him
? doesn ' t sound too unreasonable tothe me
, considering the genre
.
but let ' s face it
, any time van damme tries to be dramatic
, he looks silly
. so maximum risk is a little diferent from most otehr action films
. while watching it
, i was surprised
,
and a little disappointed
, in tghe relative lack of pyrotechnics
.
but watching soem ofthe these other action films isnt sort of like experiencing a sugar rush
; after the initial excitement
, there ' s nto much left
.
although it ' s short on spectacle
, lam ' s film leaves a better
annd omre lasting impression
, i think
. i ' m moreso impressed by it nowe tahn i was hwile watching it
,
and to me
, that ' s a good sign
. go see maximum risk
,
but don ' t expect a typical hollywood action movie
; expect a sort ofthe funky hong kong
- hollywood action movei
. the flying inkpot rating system
:
* wait for the tv2 brodcast
.
*
* a little creaky
,
but still better than staying at home wiht gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty good
, bring a friend
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuff
.
*
*
*
*
* perfection
. see it twice
