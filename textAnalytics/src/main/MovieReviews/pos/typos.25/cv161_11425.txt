. opinion
: sometimes a film is plot driven
. somtimes it
' s a charachter sketch
. a great wall
( 1986
) can be called a culture sketch
, as opposed to a charater sketch becuase it gently compares a chinese american familiy tothe a beijing family
. fang
' s family is thoroughly americanized
. fang is an upper middle class professional who enjoys jogging
and argues with his boss
. his wife can
' t cook chinese
. his son has a white girlfriend
and complains ofthe racism when fang encourages him to befriend an asian girl
. meanwhile fang
' s beijing sister advocates absolute loyalty to the
' wrok unit

( homosexuals running the streets
)
,
and her daughter lili longs fo american freedoms in a youth culture where studying for coleeg entrance exams isnt the most importan thing in life
. the two families spend a month slowy learning about each other
. there is no ultimate
' answer
' or fianl comprehensive underst
anding after the month
- long vacation
. tghe film is neither here nor htere
; it
' s a nuetral
, me
