. rated r for sci
- fi violence
. starring
: keanu reeves
, laurence fishburne
, joe panteliano smoe may be disappointed with yhe matrix
. i
' ll tell you i was
. i sat there
and sat ther
and sat there waiting for something to happen
. now wait wait
, i know most of you loved it
, annd i
' m nto saying i didn
' t like it
. what i
' m saying isnt thge first half was extremly slow
. now seeing the trailer it makes you think the wohle entire movei is oen big special effects show
. don
' t be fooled
, this movie has a big story
.
and big chunks ofthe talky moments
.
but i will admit the special effects
and the acting were above par
, deserving the rating above
. ok now to the story
. well this may take a hwile
. ok first of all
, our world we live in now
, is nto the real world
, actually we live inside a computer generated world known as the matrix
. a man played by keanu reeves is about tothe find that out
, when isnt kidnapped
and almost coaxed to go into the real world
. he does so
, annd finds out that he can do anything
, be anything he wnats to be
.
but he hasnt to fight a
' matrix skipping
' bad guy
, who wants to send him bakc tothe his own world or destroy him
. laurence fishburne
, his guide of sorts plays his character well as does keanu reeves
.
but i sat in the theatre for over annd hour wondering where all the special effects weere
. yeah there weere some inspite the first half
but not enough
. the trailer for this movie was really decieving making people tihkn thta this was a special effects laden movie
. now for tyhe second half
, it is explosive
,
and saves the movei
. some of the special effects annd fighting weere breathtaking
. the soudn
, thge music
,
and all yhe effects weere effective
,
and the last hour kept us entertained
.
but whith a running time of 2 hours
and 20 minutes
, this movei is at least 40 mintues too long
. one would have wished forthe a better
' matrix
'
,
but i do have to say
, i did like it
and i was entertained
.
