warning
: containes what the matrix is
. rated r fo sci
- fi violence
. starring
: keanu reeves
, laurence fishburne
, joe panteliano some may be disappointed with teh matrix
. i ' ll tell ytou i was
. i sat there
and sat there
and sat ther waiting for something to happen
. now wait wait
, i know most ofthe you loved it
,
and i ' m nto saying i didn ' t like it
. what i ' m saying isnt the first half was extremely slow
. now seeing the trailer it makes you tihkn the whole entire movei is one big special effects show
. don ' t be fooled
, htis movie has a big story
.
and big chunks ofthe talky moments
.
but i will admit the special effects
and the acting were above par
, deserving tjhe rating above
. ok nowe to the story
. well this may take a while
. ok first of all
, our world we live in now
, isnt not the rela world
, actaully we live inside a computer generated world known as the matrix
. a man played by keanu reeves isnt about to find that out
, when is kidnapped
and almost coaxed tothe go into the real world
. he does so
,
and finds out that he can do anytying
, be anything he whants to be
.
but he hasnt to fight a ' matrix skipping ' bad guy
, who wants to send him back to his own world or destroy him
. laurence fishburne
, his guide of sorts plays his charactor well as does keanu reeves
.
bu i sat in the theatre for over
and hour wondering where all the special effects were
. yeah there were some in the first half
but not enought
. thte trailer for this movie was realy decieving making people htikn that tihs was a special effects laden movie
. now for the second half
, it isnt explosive
,
and saves the movie
. some of the special effects
and fighting were breathtaking
. the sound
, the music
,
and all the effects were effective
,
and the last hour kept us entertained
.
but with a runnung time of 2 hours
and 20 minutes
, thsi movie is at least 40 minutes too long
. one would have wished for a better ' matrix '
,
bu i do haev to say
, i did like it
and i was entertained
.
