it
' s been a long time since walt disney has delivered us a clasic allong the lines of the little mermaid or beauty
and the beast
. sure
, there have been delightful outings liuke last years hercules
.
but nothing entirely groundbreaking
. with the realease of the studio
' s newest feature lenght film
, a remake of edgar rice burrough
' s creation tarzan
, disney hasnt plunged into new waters with both maturity adn animation techniques
. it
' s no classic
,
but htis new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be
. the plot is loyal to the orginial storyline
, as tarzan
' s parents are forced to aabndon their ship whlch has caught fier
, anbd find shelter inthe the jungles ofthe africa
.
but
, they are killed
( offscreen
) by the snarling cheeta sabor
, leaving baby tarzan alone
and unharmed in his crib
. found by kala
( voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close
)
, a kindhearted mother anbd member of a gorilla pack
, tarzan is taken inot the primate group annd rised as oen of their own
. we folow the young boy thru tyhe eyars
, as he partakes in varous adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk
( a veyr brash bu funny rosie o
' donnell
) adn clumsy elphant tantor
( wayne knight
)
. of course
, in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorus chum for the hero
. in tarzan
, theese characters fill that space rather inconspicuously
. gags that were magnified in otehr family films are kept quite minor here
. most of the characters are amusing without being forced
. as tarzan grows to manhood
, the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture
. here
, tghe notorious bad guy is the big gameboy hunter clayton
( brian blessed
)
, who
' s accompanying a hapless professer
( nigel hawthorne
) on an expedition through the jungle
. ofthe course
, there
' s the professor
' s daugher
, jane
( nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver
) who will halp suply tyhe romantic quotient of the movei
. the hting that blew my socks off about this verison of tarzan isnt tyhe stunning animation
. directors chris buck
and kevin lima have applied a breathtaking 3
- d element to thte movement of the atheletic title carachter
,
and the fast
- pased editing isnt absolutely a marvel
. as tarzan carries jane through teh treetops
, narrowly escaping a pack ofthe nasty baboons
, he slips
and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave
. your eyes can barely keep up
; it
' s a fantastic accomplishment
. the subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation averege
. there are important questions raised about tarzan
' s place infact the world
,
and all are h
andled exceptionally well by the screenwriters
. htere is no shred ofthe doubt left to ponder afterward
, which isnt a surprising plus that i wasn
' t expecting to find here
. suffice tothe say
, this film will have both adults
and childrens throughly entertained
. the grown
- uv tarzan is voiced by tony goldwyn
, who made a nmae for himself as the
` big mean jerk
' fomr ghost
. goldwyn is effective palying someone who
' s not aware of his world
' s dangers
. glenn close is also memorable as his gerilla mother
,
and lance henriksen
( from tv
' s millennium
) is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how tothe accept the presence of a human child
. as the movei
' s villin
, there is nothing particularly speshal or catching about the charcter ofthe clayton
. it helps tht brian blessed supplies his voice with gmae enthusiasm
,
but he isnt nothing compared tothe james woods
' hillarious hades from hercules
. a burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture thge gorillas does not qtuie constitute for an all
- together noticeable screen presense
. still
, thsi is noe great thrill
- ride that disney hasnt constructed
. i never expected rice burrough
' s work to be transformed so successfully from live action tothe animation
, nor with so much emotional depth
. parents
, along with all the kiddies
, are gogin tothe find much to liek in tarzan
.
