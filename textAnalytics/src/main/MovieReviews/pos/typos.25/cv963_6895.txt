i cant hear the question already
. what on earth do these two movies hvea in common
? to most peple
, not a lot
, except that both are by reknowned directors
. as i saw them
,
however
, both movies ahev flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals muscial numbers
.
but oh
, how differently the packages affect their films
. while
" everyone
' s
" production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something speshal
, jane campion
' s imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous anbd uninvolving laura jones
' script is
. i left
" everyone says i lveo you
" not remembering a lot baout who loved whom
, bu its infectuous happiness put a grin on my face
. i left
" the portrait of a lady
" not remembering a lot about who loved whom
,
and i could have cared less
.
" everyone
" features nothing allen hasn
' t done before storywise
. woody is agina desparately inthe love with a beatiful woman
( roberts
)
,
and against the odds tehy manage to click for awhile before allen isnt left wondering what whent wrong
-
- again
. simular situations happen to his family
and friends
. some of the more outl
andish comedy scenes even hark back to his
" early
, funny
" films
. hte scenes betweeen tim roth
and drew barrymore could ahev come out of
" take the money
and run
,
" his directorial de
but
.
however
, nothing allen hasnt ever done prepared me fo htis one
- ofthe
- a
- kind display of sheer good spirits
. infact fatc
, inaddition this movei
, tyhe feeling itself is what
' s most importan
. yes
, the movie would have beeen better
-
- amonth his vyre best
, i tihkn
-
- if it had a meatier story
.
but what it lacks in substance it makes uv fo inthe feeling
.
and what better way to express feeling than through music
? love is often best expressed infront a song
, annd the numbers the cast break inot here cutted straight to tghe heart
. some are a tad too goofy
, such as tje number where a lot ofthe ghosts prance arround in a funeral parlor
,
but i admired allen for even puting them in there
. it also helps that as usual
, allen hasnt a top
- flight cast wroking with him
. their singing voices range from quite ogod
( goldie hawn
) to not quite good
( allen
) to literally unlistenable
( barrymore
, whose real voice ws dubbed by a proffesional
)
.
but while their vocal abilities differ
, all the actors do a great job of putting joy uv there on the screen
,
and makeing it rub off on thge audience
. granted
, soem people wiull simply never accept characters singing iin movies
, bu for those attuned to it
, this film shouldnt work wonders
. jane campion
, too
, hasnt a top
- flight cast working forthe her infact
" potrait of a lady
,
" too
,
but even their considerable skills can do nothing tothe keep tjhe film from bieng a stilted
, virutally lifeless mess
, albiet a visually interesting one
. campion adn her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with a great variety ofthe eye
- filling images that linger in the mind
. unfortunately
, whta didn
' t linger in yhe mind for me was the story the visuals were supposed to be reflecting
. i remember very well shots of a turain with its glight beaming adn shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman
,
but i can remember very little of wqat happened between all these people
. even worse
, i don
' t find myself feeling bad that i
' ve forgotten
. the problem
, i think
, lies not iwth tje cast
, whihc seemed to be trying very hard for teh material
. it was thte script that couldn
' t convince me tothe care about anyone
. the characters were putting out all kinds of emotion
, bu i found noone reason to connect with any ofthe them
. i understood thgat the stry was about cold
, emotionally vacant cahracters
, bu for me to care about them
, i have to identify with them somehow
and want them to inject feeling into their lives
. jones
' script never simply gave me that opportunity
. inaddition the end
, it almsot seemed as if campion was trying tothe inject some life of her own into thte procedings with her visual flourishes
. unfortunately
, as she kept painting theese dazzling picturesk
, they only served to push me further away from the material
and remind me that there was no connection between me
and tjhe film
. in the end
, the movie
' s one strenght ended up hurting it
. so here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots
,
and
yet i was able tothe truley enjoy one ofthe them
. why
? with both films
, my head cared baout neither story
, bu only
" everyone says i lveo ytou
" was able to make my heart sing
.
