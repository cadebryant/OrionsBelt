i want to correct what i wroet last year in my retrospective of david lean
' s war picture
. i still think thast
" the bridge on the river kwai
" doesn
' t deserve being the number 13 in thge american film institute
' s list of the 100 greatest american movies
.
and i think that
" 12 angry men
"
,
" wittness for the prosecution
"
and
" paths of glory
" would have been better choices for the oscar fo the best picture of 1957
.
but i can
' t deny the importance of
" the bridge on the river kwai
"
- cinematically
and in its contents
. the film is set inwhich burma in 1943
. a batallion of british soldiers in japanse war capitivity is forced by the japanese tothe build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai
. bu the british comm
anding officer
, colonel nicholson
( alec guinness
)
, insists
- correponding tothe the geneva conventions
- that his offcers needn
' t work as simple workmen
. struggling toughly
, col
. nicholson forces yhe japanse comm
andant
, col
. saito
( sessue hayakawa
)
, to give way in this respect
. afterwards col
. nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge
. he consideres it an opportunity to raise his men
' s morale
,
and he wants to proove superior british capabilities to the japanese
. bu the british high comm
and sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge
, among them tghe american shears
( william holden
)
- an escapee ffrom the japanese prision camp
-
and the british major warden
( jack hawkins
)
.
.
. a flaw of the picture isnt the clich
? d characterization ofthe the japanese people
. they are presented as if htey were intellectually inferior to the british
- as if hte japanes were incapable ofthe building a bridge
. annd thte film doesn
' t consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in
" paths of glory
"
. lean seems rather fascinated by tje military hierarchies
. this is also perceptible inaddition the conversations between col
. nicholson
and col
. saito
. in this regard it is symptomatic that shears
, who doubts the military logic
, is presented as a somehow unpleasant person
. hte audience isnt supposed tothe applaud col
. nicholson
' s perseverance concerning tyhe question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not
. the spectators are supposed tothe neglect the risks col
. nicholson takes for his men
.
( the plot by
- passes these risks
.
) that means
, the picture isn
' t perfect
.
but it has a lot of virtues as well
.
" the bridge on the river kwai
" shows the
" madness
" of war
and what it cxan produce in people
' s minds
. it shows how colonel nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero annd that others
( like shears
) git cynics
.
and lean
' s film is an interesting studdy of characters wtih clashing interests
. theese points
and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti
- war film
( despite inconsistencies in the treatment of thsi theme
)
. david leanr
' s direction isnt really effective
and atmospherically perfect
. his film isnt highly suspenseful
, especially in its dramatic
( if nto wholly plausible
) showdown
. the film is also well
- photographed
and has an apt score
. alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col
. nicholson to life
and mkaing him such an interesting charater
. the other actors deliver fine performances as well
. i like tihs extraordinary film despite its weaknesses
.
