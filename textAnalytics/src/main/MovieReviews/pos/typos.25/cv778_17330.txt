i wanna to correct waht i wroet last yearm in my retrospective of david lean ' s war picture
. i still think that
" the bridge on the river kwai
" doesn ' t deserve being the number 13 infact the american film institute ' s list of the 100 greatest american movies
.
and i think that
" 12 angry men
"
,
" wittness for the prosecution
"
and
" paths of glory
" would have been better choices for the oscar for hte best picture of 1957
.
but i can ' t deny teh importance of
" the bridge on tyhe river kwai
"
- cinematically
and in its contents
. yhe film isnt set inthe burma in 1943
. a batallion ofthe british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai
.
but thte british commanding officer
, colonel nicholson
( alec guiness
)
, insists
- correposding to the geneva conventions
- tht his officers needn ' t owrk as simple workmen
. struggling toughly
, col
. nicholson forces the japanesse commandant
, col
. saito
( sessue hayakawa
)
, to give way in this respect
. afterwards col
. nicholson assiduously commits himselv fo thge building of tyhe bridge
. he consideres it an opportunity tothe raise his men ' s morale
,
and he wants tothe prove superior brittish capabilities to the japanese
.
but yhe brittish high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge
, among them tje american shears
( william holden
)
- an escapee from tje japanese prison camp
-
adn the british major warden
( jack hawkins
)
.
.
. a flaw of the picture is the clich
? d characterization of thte japanse people
. they are presented as if htey were intellectually inferior tothe tjhe brittish
- as if the japanese were incapable ofthe building a bridge
.
and the film doesn ' t consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in
" paths ofthe glory
"
. lean seems rather facinated by the military hierarchies
. this is alsot perceptible iin the conversations bewteen col
. nicholson
and col
. saito
. inspite this regard it is symptomatic that shears
, who doubts the military logic
, isnt presented as a somehow unpleasant person
. the audience is supposed to applaud col
. nicholson ' s perseverance concerning yhe question if his officers shall work onthe tyhe bridge or not
. the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col
. nicholson takes for his men
.
( the plot by
- passes theese risks
.
) that means
, tghe picture isn ' t perfect
.
but it has a lot of virtues as well
.
" the bridge on hte river kwai
" shows the
" madness
" of war
and what it cant produce in people ' s minds
. it shows how coonel nicholson becomes possessed by the idae of being a hero
and that others
( like shears
) get cynics
.
adn lean ' s film is an intresting study ofthe characters with clashing interests
. theese points
and the somtimes ironic dialogue make thsi film an anti
- war film
( despite inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme
)
. david leanr ' s direction isnt really effective
and atmospherically perfect
. his film is highly suspenseful
, especially in its dramatic
( if not wholly plausible
) showdown
. the film isnt aslo well
- photographed
and has an apt score
. alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col
. nicholson to life
and making him such an interesting charater
. yhe other actors deliver fine performances as well
. i like this extraordinary film dispite its weaknesses
