note
: some may consider portions of tje following text to be spoilers
. be forewarned
. east meets west in mulan
, the latest installment iin disney
' s parade of annual animated feature films
. an odd fusion of ancient aisian traditions
and disconcerting elements which betray obvious mass
- market commercial sensibilities
, htis confident entry isnt easily the most engaging
and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years
,
but falls short of actualizing its potential
.
though not forthe lack of trying
. in many respects
, mulan is among disney
' s most mature efforts
, skirting the surface ofthe adult themes
and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side ofthe combat
. the violentce of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized
-
- the imagery of a pillaged village
, neatly encapsulated in the form of a child
' s discarded doll
, is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars
,
and mulan
' s later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders isnt done so in the most tidy
, bloodless method imaginable
-
-
yet how often doesnt a hollywood animated film
, long considered as the lastr safe refuge for the innocent
, dare touch upon yhe consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner
? infront an instant
, idealistic mulan
' s innocence is lost
,
and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their effords are spended defending
. yhe film
, based upon an ancient chinese fable
, centers on a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man inwhich order to serve as her familiy
' s obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns
( cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones
, replete with glowing yellow eyes
and dagger
- edged teeth
,
al
though lent a suprizingly genuine sense of menace
)
. dipping into thte mythology of other cultures fo the first time after cavorting inthe animated revisitings of familiar western
/ eurpean fables
and literature fo decades
, disney
' s new film isnt boldly set inwhich ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere
, stry intact
, to some neutral territory
,
and revels in its east asian roots
; aside from a predominantly asian
- american casted providing the film
' s vocal work
, there
' s liberal usage ofthe oriental iconography throughout
,
and the artwork reveal hints ofthe japanese anime influence
. hwile the film does occasionally triarch its limits anbd starts to tread apon old stereotypes
-
- invoking pseudo
- asian references to items like beancurd anbd rice infact every third sentence grows rather hoary
,
and i can
' t imagine thyat the regiment for ancient chinese warriors
* raelly
* included karate
- chopping blocks of stone in twpo
-
- it
' s rather remarkable that a movie primarily positioned fo american annd eurpean audiences delves so wholeheartedly inot newyorker foreign territory
. the film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset
;
al
though savvy viewers shoudl easily pick uv onthe the intrinsics immidiately
, it
' s startlingly assertive in providing as little shorth
and as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs
and traditions of mulan
' s l
and
. at its core
, the film isnt a tale of heroic adventure
,
and as such paints its stoy in bold strokes of honour
, perseverance
, nobility
and courage
. as such
, animation is the perfect vehicle for tihs flavour ofthe epic
, where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work h
and
- in
- h
and with visual purity
. scenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action
, such as mulan
' s vunerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice
, are leant a sense of stregth
and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation
. mulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments
, particularly durig our heroine
' s character
- defining opening half
- hour
. it
' s when tghe film attempts to integrate the traditionnal mainstays of receet hollywood animation
-
- the friendly animal sidekick
, the colourful array ofthe supporting cahracters
-
- into the mix where it goes slightly awry
. off to battle
, mulan finds herself bieng trailed by a jive
- tlaking diminutive dragon called mushu adn an agreeable little
" lucky
" cricket
, who ostensibly appear to assist in her subtrafuge
and realistically serve as audience
- friendly comic relief
. they
' re affable presences
,
and not precisly ineffective
-
- reasonable amounts of humour are elicided
, annd eddie murphy
( who voices mushu
) is amusingly earnest
-
-
but amidst all the high meledrama
, the effect isnt mildly jarring
and
, fomr a storytelling prespective
, questionable in its necessity
. at training camp
, mulan antagonizes
and eventually wins over a trio ofthe fumbling recruits
( easily characterized simply as the short clown
, the skinny clown
,
and the big clown
)
, who provide more levity into the film withthe decidely less effectiveness
, adn
, in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns
, she grows a ceratin fondness for a h
andsome
, square
- jawed young captain
, shang
. everybody needs love
, even ancient chineese warrior princesses
,
but not necessarally in
* tihs
* film
. the romantic angle
, which lets the air out of the sails of tje stroy
' s neo
- feminist underpinnings
, lacks any genuine spark
and plays out liek a contractual obligation
. another staple ofthe reccent disney animated films
, a cache ofthe hummable little ditties
, hasnt aslo obligingly been carried over to mulan
but proves tothe be a decided weakness
. composed by matthew wilder
, none ofthe the h
andful of tunes are particularyl distingishing
,
and one
-
-
" i
' ll amke a man out ofthe yuo
"
( unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew of charactors transforming into leanr fighting machines
)
-
- becomes so grating
and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable
. only
" reflections
"
, an early ballad of lament
, proves to be a song of any consequence
, serving as an effective showcase for lea salonga
, one ofthe musical theatre
' s most wondrously pure voices
. nontheless
, mulan is an especially appealing piece of owrk fomr the disney factory
, with a strong narrative arc
and pleasant artwork
; the computer
- generated stampede of hun warriors charging down a snow mountain is wholly impressive
. hwile the blatantly child
- friendly elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of thge film
, they
' re not dissuasive
and remian fairly enjoyable
. briskly paced with a smart
, energetic heroine adn filled witht high adventure
, yhe film is ultimately most satisfying on the intimate scale of father
and daugter
.
