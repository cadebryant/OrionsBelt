i have seen several
(
bu not that many
) woody allen movies
. i didn ' t particulary liuke radio days
, the purple rose of cairo
, play it again
, sam
. i quite enjoied manhatten murder mystery
and everything
.
.
. sex
,
and i loved might aphrodite
.
however i found bullets over broadway to be a snoozing bore
.
and bullets got some very raving reviews
,
but i didn ' t think i ' d like
.
bu i finally saw it
( double feature with ready to wear i think
)
and hated it
. since
.
.
. i loev you aslo seems to be getting raving reviews i wasn ' t sure if i ' d want to see
.
.
. thankfully i did
! people burst inot singing
and dancing
, something i hardly ever like
.
bu this movie is so infectuous
.
and funny
!
and entertaining
!
(
and unlike evita
, htey only sing when htey need to
.
) sure soem ofthe the actors may nto be great singers
,
but they seems to be having a great time
,
annd so does the audience
. that ' s all i have tothe say
. really
, if you htink thgat isnt going tothe be a dull movie
, ytou ' re probably dead
.
and dead people shouldnt nto be forced into movie theatres
. is mark leeper dead
? he said that
" this isnt an almost ghastly misfire
"
. the movie is rated r
, for
* one
* ule of tje word motherf
