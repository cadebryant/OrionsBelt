( bu not that many
) woody allen movies

' t particulary liek radio days
, the purple rose of cairo
, play it again
, sam
. i quite enjoyed manhatten muder mystery
and everyting
.
.

,
and i loved might aphrodite
. howver i foudn bullets over broadway to be a snoozing bore
.
and bullets got soem very raving reviews
,

' t thikn i

)
and hated it
. usance

. i love you also seems to be getting raving reviews i wasn
' t sure if i
' d want to see
.

. thankfully i did
! people burst into singing annd dancing
, something i hardly ever liuke
.
but this movie is so infectious
. annd funny
!
and entertaining
!
( adn unlike evita
, they onyl sing when they ened to
.
) sure some of tyhe actors may not be great singers
,
but they seems to be having a great time
, annd so does the audience
