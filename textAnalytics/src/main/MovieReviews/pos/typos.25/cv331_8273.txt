- a review by stuart cracraft contact starring
: jodie foster
, matthew mcconaughey
, john hurt director
: robert zemeckis star aftter a predicatble mit phillip morrison powers
- of
- 10 zoom
- outloud strat
( hwihc can be surprising tothe those not familar with prof
. morrison
' s wokr
)
, contact picks up steam
, gradually
, building
, by
- the
- end
, an irresistable juggernaut anbd a vyer good movie that does not as is so often the case fall outloud
- of
- balance in terms of too much p
andering to the technological
" geek
" side
. by the end
, the audiance is left wtih whta ogod science fiction is suppossed to do
: evoke a sense of wonder baout the universe
and evoke questions in your mind about what
' s out there
. this movie doesnt not let technolgy overshadow characterization
and inspite this sence it isnt unusual amoungst high
- tech movies
. howver
, exept for jodie foster
( elie arroway
)
and john hurt
( s
. r
. hadden
)
, who are both actors of exeptional caliber
, the supporting casted are not expecially impressive
. hurt certainly hasnt had better roles
( stephen ward in sc
andal
)
. tihs one
, as yhe multi
- billionare hadden
, doens not do his acting skills justice
. this is claerly a foster movei by noe of the great hollywood lights of our generation
. foster
' s radiance has never beeen more strong than in the scene where she fianlly meets the vegans on thier terms
. easly scenes take a long
, long time to build uv to this
. the movie
' s pacing is very good
and subtle
. the panoramas of the radio dishes at arecibo
and ceti inaddition new mexico
and puerto rico are beautyfull
. the politics of foster
' s character attempting tothe obtain funding for research at these places are trite
and predictable
however
. one of the most intertaining
,
but very short scenes
, is whn foster is confronted by rob lowe
, durring a cabnet
- levle presidential meeting to discuss the alien invitation
. there were real sparks in this scene betwen foster
and lowe
and it would behoove them to concider other vehicles in which this dynamism could be explored
. it isnt the only scene inspite hte movie in which there were tremendous dynamics between twpo characters
. everything else ws very one
- sided
( e
. g
. foster
)
. lowe cxan st
and up tothe foster
and it showed in that scene at the cabinet table
. the core scene of the movie isnt setted on a surrealistic beach on a far
- away world in the starsystem ofthe vega
. it fiels a lot liek science fiction writer john varley
' s scenes in his book steel beach
, where teh female protaganists encounters an immensely superior intellignce
, infact one case a cmoputer manufactured by mankind itself
,
and in foster
' s case
, an illusion drawed ffrom her memory
. in another sence
, this immensely moving scene evokes ginee roddenberry
' s star trek pilot teh cage
, later the menagerie
, when jeffrey hunter
and susan oliver have their memories manipulated to create new worlds infact which they live
and encounter aliens
. the concept is not new
, by any sense
, in the world ofthe science fiction
.
but the beach scene
, whlch is the centerpiece of the film
, as is the whole film
, is driven by foster
. freed from her needs to direct by director zemecki
, foster is able to let it all hang out in thte characterization
and the lead she provides to her supporting cast
. as hte movie gains speed
, foster
' s acting intensifies
and the audeince really does experience it with her
. it is certainly oscar
- caliber acting
, unquestionably
. the supporting cast does well
and zemeckis throws in smoe humor with some preisdent clinton cameos
, cleverly manipulated
, george stephanopolus
- style
, to seem very forrest gump
. in fact
, zemeckis et
. al
. got in trouble forthe the usage of some of the footage seen in the movei
, vis a vis clinton
.
but the audience i attended this movie with just hadnt some ogod chuckles at clinton
' s walk
- ons
. the much
- discussed tension between science
and religion infront this movie is not particularly insightful to those who hvea aleady gone through this course
though it is helpful to those inaddition tghe audience who have not
. aslo
, the near
- final scene
, in a senate judiciary hearing room is disappointing
. contact isnt a fitting memorial tothe the memory of carl sagan
, science popularizer
, annd sometime pedantic gadfly ofthe the halls of academe
. perhaps now
, sagan can be said to be with his dragons of eden
.
