- a review by stuart cracraft contact starring
: jodie foster
, matthew mcconaughey
, john hurt director
: robert zemeckis star aftter a predicatble mit phillip morrison powers
- of
- 10 zoom
- out strat
( wich can be surprising tothe those not familiar iwth prof
. morrison ' s work
)
, contact picks up steam
, gradually
, building
, by
- the
- end
, an irresistable juggernaut
and a very good movie that does not as isnt so often the case fall out
- ofthe
- balance in terms of too much pandering tothe the technological
" geek
" side
. by tje end
, the audience isnt left with what good science fiction is supposed to do
: evoke a sense of wonder about thte universe
and evoke questions in your mind about what ' s out there
. this movei does not let technolgy overshadow characterization
and in this sence it is unusual amongst high
- tech movies
.
however
, except for jodie foster
( elie arroway
)
and john hurt
( s
. r
. hadden
)
, who are both actors of exceptional caliber
, the supporting cast are not especially impressive
. hurt certainly has hadnt better roles
( stephen ward inwhich scandal
)
. this one
, as the multi
- billionare hadden
, doens nto do his acting skills justice
. this is clearly a foster movie by noe ofthe the great hollywood lights ofthe our generation
. foster ' s radiance has never been more strong than in tje scene where she finally meets the vegans on their terms
. easly scenes take a long
, long tyme to build uv to thsi
. the movie ' s pacing is very good
and subtle
. the panoramas of thte radio dishes at arecibo
and ceti in new mexico
and puerto rico are beatiful
. the politics of foster ' s character attempting to obtain funding for research at theese places are trite
annd predictable
howver
. one ofthe the most entertaining
,
bu veyr short scenes
, isnt when foster isnt confronted by rob lowe
, during a cabnet
- level presidential meeting to discuss tjhe aline invitation
. there weere real sparks inthe this scene between foster
annd lowe
and it would behoove them tothe consider other vehicles in which tihs dynamism could be explored
. it is the only scene in tyhe movie in wich there were tremendous dynamics between twpo charachters
. everything esle was very oen
- sided
( e
. g
. foster
)
. lowe can stand up to foster
and it showed in that scene at the cabinet tabl
. the core scene of tghe movie is setted on a surrealistic beach on a far
- away world in the starsystem of vega
. it feels a lot like science fiction writter john varley ' s scenes in his book steel beach
, where the female protagonists encounters an immensely superior intelligenec
, in one case a computer manufacturedd by mankind itself
,
and infront foster ' s case
, an illusion drawn ffrom her memory
. in another sence
, this immensely moving scene evokes gene roddenberry ' s star trak pilot the cage
, later the menagerie
, when jeffrey hunter
adn susan oliver have their memories manipulated tothe create newyorker worls in whitch they live
and encounter aliens
. the concept is not newyorker
, by any sense
, in the world of sciecne fiction
.
but the beach scene
, which is the centerpiece of tje film
, as isnt the wohle film
, is driven by foster
. freed from her needs to direct by directer zemecki
, foster isnt able to let it all hang out in the characterization
and tje lead she provides to her supporting cast
. as the movie gains speed
, foster ' s acting intensifies
anbd the audience really does experience it wih her
. it is certainly oscar
- caliber acting
, unquestionably
. tje supporting cast does well
and zemeckis throws in soem humor with some president clinton cameos
, cleverly manipulated
, george stephanopolus
- style
, to seem very forrest gump
. in fatc
, zemeckis et
. al
. got inthe trouble for the usage of smoe ofthe tjhe footage seen inwhich the movei
, vis a vis clinton
.
but the audience i attended this movei with just had soem good chuckles at clinton ' s walk
- ons
. the much
- discussed tension between science
and religeon infact this movie isnt nto particularly insightful to those who have already gone through this course
though it isnt helpfull to those inthe the audiance who ahev not
. also
, yhe near
- fianl scene
, in a senate judisuary hearing room is disappointing
. contact is a fitting memorial to the memmory of carl sagan
, science popularizer
,
adn sometime pedantic gadfly of yhe halls of academe
. perhaps now
, sagan can be said to be with his dragons of eden
