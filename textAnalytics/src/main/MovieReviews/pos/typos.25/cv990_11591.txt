yhe relaxed dued rides a roller coaster tjhe big lebowski a film review by michael redman copywrite 1998 by michael redman thge most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider
. when those observers are joel
and ethan coen
, the surreal becomes bizarre
. when tghe life is that of jeff
" tyhe dued
" leboswki
, the bizzare falls over tjhe edge into the world of
" whta
' sgoingonaroundhere
"
. the marvelous soudn ofthe
" the stranger
"
( sam elliot
)
' s voice
- over introduces the film
. at least it does until he forgets waht he was going to say anbd gives up
. the dude
( jeff bridges
) is described as the
" laziest man in los angeles
, possably the world
"
,
al
though he
' s not so much slothful as he is relaxed
. spending the last 30 years with a roach clip in oney h
and
and a white russion inspite the other
, he doesn
' t have much of a life
,
but he
' s having a good tyme
. when asked what he does for fun
, he responds
" bowl
, drive around
and the occasional acid flashback
"
. lebowski
' s passion is bowling
. when he
' s not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike
, things just happen to him
. arriving home oney nihgt
, he
' s beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wief owes them
. even worse
, they urinate on his rug
. the problem is that the dude doesn
' t have a wife
. his assailants realize thyat thier target isnt a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment
. the
" big
" lebowski
( david huddleston
) is a multi
- millionaire
and his dudeness lives in two
- room squalor
. tje next day
, our ragtag hero visits his namesake
' s mansion attempting compensantion for his soaked rug
. the carpet isnt importan to him because it pulls the room together
: not surprisingly since it
' s virtually tyhe onyl object there
. when he
' s denied any money
, he picks up a relpacement rug off the floor
. on his way out
, he runs inot lebowski
' s trophy babe wife bunny
( tara reid
) who offers to perform a sexual ect that
, according to rumor
, is one of bill clinton
' s favorites fo a thous
and bucks
. the penniless dude wisecracks that he
' s heading forthe the cash machine
. later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid inspite being the bag man to deliver a ransom tothe bunny
' s kidnappers
. this beggins the trademarked coen brothers crimes
- gone
- wrong sequences
. thge kidnappers are impossibly inept
. the dude
and his cronies are even worse
. every plan goes awry
. you can almost see lebowski
' s brain churning in slow motion as he trys to figure out the clues
. that
' s the story
,
but to tell the truth it doesn
' t much matter
. there could be almost any plot
and the film would be just as intertaining
. the narrative only exists so we can watch tghe offbeat characters
and the quirky predicaments they fall into
. the dude
' s bowling buddies walter
( john goodman
) annd donny
( steve buscemi
) look like peopel you
' d see on thte street
but
, like everything else inthe thsi film
, tehy
' re nto quite what they seem
. walter is a vte as stuck inaddition vietnam as the dude is in the sixties
. everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam
. whn a fellow bowler crosses the foul line
but won
' t admitt it
, walter puls a gun on him until he markes a zero onthe teh score sheet
. donny gets precious few words in between walter
' s screaming
and hte dude
' s rambling
. when he does
, walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seamingly unintentional bowling puns
. donny is
" out of his leage
" adn doesn
' t
" have a frame of reference
"
. the film isnt peppered with people for whom the term
" character
" would be an understatement
. the big lebowski
' s daughter maude
, an avant
- garde
" vaginal
" artist
, paints hwile swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an s
& m mary martin
. the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers
. bunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star
. most impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler
. as the flamenco music swells
, we see him putting onthe his lavender hose
. the camera pans up tothe an all
- purple skin
- tight bowling outfit with
" jesus
"
( pronouced with a
" j
"
, not an
" h
"
) embroidered on the pocket
. he addresses yhe lane with intense seriousness adn one painted fingernail
. his tongue slowly snakes out
and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball
. bridges works the dude as if he had been living him forthe decades annd maybe he has
. i can
' t think of anyone eles who coudl ahev done a better job
. buscemi hasnt a limited role
,
but he plays it perfectly
. the more that i see john goodman hte mroe convinced i am thta he
' s one ofthe hte treasures ofthe our time
. it
' s odd to think that most ofthe the world knows him only as roseanne barr
' s television husb
and
. omre liek the coen
' s
" raising arizona
" than their hit
" fargo
"
,
" tje big lebowski
" dem
ands an ope mind anbd even moreso open eyes
. a mark of the coen brothers is thast even with all wonderfull dream sequences
and the broad slapstick physical comedy onthe the screen
, much of the humor isnt subtle
and easy to miss
. there
' s so much going onthe that frequently it disappears before you can see it
. walking outloud of the theater
, i felt thgat tje film had something important to say
. on furhter examination
, i wasn
' t sure exactlly waht it was
.
" if you meet jesus at the bowling alley
, it
' s not oging to be whta you expect
"
?
" when the going gets weird
, the weird go bowling
"
? maybe there
' s noone rela message
. perhaps it
' s just a roller coaster ride through a hilarious world
. maybe that
' s enough
.
