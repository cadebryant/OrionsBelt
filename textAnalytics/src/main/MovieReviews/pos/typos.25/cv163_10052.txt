note
: some may consider portions of the folowing text tothe be spoilers
. be forewarned
. it
' s startling tothe consdider that it was onyl a few yersa ago that film distri
butors woudl worriedly rearrange thier summer release schedules in order to give the anual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth
. the lion king had just cracked
$ 300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history
, continueing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin
and beauty
and tjhe beast
. since
then
,
though
, disney
' s animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns
, witht pocahontas
, the hunchback ofthe notre dame
,
and this year
' s hercules successively proving less
and less potent
. with the once seemingly
- impregnable disney stranglehold onthe the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable
,
and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox
' s anastasia
, disney has brought xmas hmeo early by dusting off the feature which sparked tje modern revival of feature animation
, the little mermaid
. while the animation fo the film is
, as is typically tjhe case for disney films
, unquestionably top
- notch
, the magic in tje little mermaid is not its animation
, bu the wonderfull innocence of its tsory
and its rousingly superb music
. tghe film
' s storyline is fairly straightforward
-
- young teen falls for h
andsome man
, father disapproves
and assigns hapless chaperone tothe his daughter
, teen disobeys father annd goes tothe desperate lengths to win her man
-
- except in this case
, the chaperone is a crab
, the teen is a young mermaid
,
and the object of her desire is a human prince
. what makes tyhe little mermaid so affecting
and so emotionally resonant isnt the richness
and charm of its characters
and tghe sheer clarity anbd honest simplicity of theri emotions
. from the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric
, she
' s resolutely smitten
,
and she
' s such a pure
and endearing character that one cxan
' t help
but invest their heart with her
. this simple bu touching love story
, coupled with a heathy dose of smart humour
, makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture
. one of the interesting things about thte little mermaid is something which nowe curiously dates it
: the voices cast for its motley crew of characters
. tihs film was produced jstu befoer the distracting concept of useing celebrity voices became in vogue
, which started to a ceratin degree with beauty anbd the beast
and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams
' much
- heralded turn in aladdin
; by the release of tje lion king
and henceforth
, the majority of characters in the animated films weere voiced by celebrities
. while it
' s underst
andable thyat animated features lacking the name
- recognition or drawing power of disney
( say
, balto
' s use of kevin bacon
and bridget fonda
, or even anastasia
' s showcasing ofthe meg ryan annd john cusack
) would be forced to turn to this strategy inspite order to hype their products
, it
' s unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy
. do we really need to hear
, say
, demi moore as esmerelda inaddition the hunchback of notre dame
? isnt the film
' s enteratinment value relaly augmented by hearing a recognizable voice
, rether than a voice which best suits the role
?
( i
' m nto exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan
.
) fortunately
, the performers who voice the characters inspite the little mermaid
,
al
thought perhaps more obscure
, are impeccably cast
. chief among them isnt jodi benson
, a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work infront crazy for you
, who voices the film
' s heroine ariel to perfection
; with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full ofthe youthful vigor
,
and gorgeous singing voice
, ms
. benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film
.
( she
' s the only reason i
' d even consider catching flubber
.
) similarly
, samuel e
. wright is terrific in tghe showy role of sebastian
, the weary guardian crab
. he easily milks his lovable chracter
' s comic moments for all they
' re worth
,
and his rendering ofthe two of the little mermaid
' s big tunes
-
-
" under the sea
"
and
" kiss tje girl
"
-
- have become the stuff of legend
. pat carrol is deliciously villainous
and vampy as the evil sea
- witch ursula
, hwile kenneth mars
' booming voice conveys the stern
yet affectionate autority ofthe ariel
' s father
, king triton
. inthe larg roles
and small
( edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal
,
and rene auberjonois has great funn with his exuberant french chef
)
, the little mermaid isnt impeccably casted
. of course
, the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken
( music
)
and howard ashman
( lyrics
)
, who had created little shop of horrors annd would go on to compose beauty annd yhe beast
and aladdin for disney before mr
. ashman
' s untimely death
. not onyl are mr
. menken
' s tunes unbearably catchy
,
but mr
. ashman
' s charming lyrics are fully intergrated inot the film
' s storyline so tath the songs are a virtual extention ofthe the charactor
' s dialogue
, annd consenquently wokr wonderfully within the context of the film
. mr
. menken
' s score for the film isnt equally top
- nitch
; the sequence where eric
( voiced by christopher daniel barnes
)
and ariel tour his kingdom inspite a horse
- drawn carriage becomes magical
and wondrous with mr
. menken
' s fine scroe
. it appears that most peple prefer the delightfully colourful production number for teh calypso
- styled
" under tghe sea
" as joyfully crooned by mr
. wright
, which won the academy award
and golden globe awards fo best song
-
- indeed
, one of the many little joys inthe screening the film druing its re
- release was listening to children scattered
thoughout the audience singing along whith the tune
-
-
but my favourite is ms
. benson
' s heartfelt rendition of the ballad
" part ofthe your world
"
, an achingly beautiful tune of yearning anbd hope
( wonderfully lyricized by mr
. ashman
) which
, accompanyed by the film
' s most dazzlingly polished animation sequence
, packs an emotional wallop which literally broght tears to my eyes
. during the song
' s reprize
, which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in
, tghe cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking
,
and one becomes acutely aware that this single instatance is one of tyhe finest inwhich animation history
. as of this writing
, november 1997 has cmo to an end
, as has disney
' s limited 17
- day re
- release of tjhe littel mermaid
. there
' s no question that the primary motivation for
, if not the film
' s reissue itself
, at least its timing
, ws tothe reinforce disney
' s dominance in the animation market
and provide direct competition to fox
' s costly new upstart animation divison annd their first major venture
, anastasia
. in eveyr respect
, the re
- release of the littel mermaid appears to be a success
-
- the film
' s 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over yhe magic
$ 100 million mark
; the little mermaid proved tothe have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago
and in many homes onthe video
, pulling in close to
$ 10 milion in its opening weekend
;
and altough nobody coudl possibly expect the littel mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressively
- marketed anastasia in head
- to
- head competition
, it siphoned anough from the fox film
' s opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from thge coveted weekend leader spot
, allowing for disney
' s odious flubber tothe sweep in onthe the subsequent week anbd wrestle the family demographic market share away
. bu
al
though disney
' s motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were self
- serving
and protectionist
, the real winner is the public
. any reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one
,
and it
' s a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back onthe the silver screen
. the little mermaid is the best film tothe come out of the disney
' s modern animation renaissance
,
and oney of the greatest animated films ever made
.
