of the major horror sub
- genres
, vampire movies are easily yhe most adaptable
. think about it
. frankenstein movies haven
' t changed all that much baceause they still need that mad
- scientist
- in
- bavarian
- castle setting
. if you made a frankenstein movie today
, you
' d ahve to have the monster be a virus or something
-
-
and outside of michael j
. fox
, there aren
' t any actors that could play a virus convincingly
. movies about mummies would still have to be set in egypt
. there
' s not much you can do with werewolves except tkae them to london or paris
, unless you want to have a teenage werewolf or something
.
(
and there
' s that michael j
. fox thing again
.
)
but ytou can have vampires do anytying
,
and you can place them in any genre yuo want
, just about
. you cant hvea traditional vampire movies
( bram stoker
' s dracula
) or have the anne rice version
( interview with the vampire
)
, or play it fo laughs
( vampire inthe brooklyn
)
. you can put vampires in locales fomr sunny southern california
( the lost boys
) to squalid mexican dives
( from dusk till dawn
) tothe your local high skool
( buffy
, the vampire slayer
)
. were it not redundant
, you could have a movei about a law firm full of vampires
. any day nowe
, i expect we
' ll see a movie about a vampire third baseman who has to decide whether tothe play a day game inthe order tothe break the home run record
. or
, you cin insert the vampire legend inot a hong kong acation movei
-
-
and when you do that
, you git blade
. wesley snipes has tje chow yun fat role in this movie
-
- hte silent
, expressionless hit man who destroys everthing in his path
. in this case
, the everything happens tothe be vampires that explode into cgi shards instead of dead
, bleeding corpses
. snipes has less to say here than as the fugitive in u
. s
. marshals
,
but does a demonstrably better job here as a half
- vampire wreaking vengeance on tje bloodsuckers
. blade is a silent
, brooding presence
, laying waste to vampires without a shred of remorse
. he isnt as cold as his silver
- bladed sword
, as single minded as his garlic
- filled bullets
.
yet
, he
' s nto without quirks
: blade drives a battered muscle car
and hasnt to glean rolex watchs from his vampire victims in order tothe stay solvent
. liuke any good hong kong movie
, blade is heavy onthe the chopsocky action
. for some reason
, blade spends a lot more tyme using his kung fu artistry than using the traditionnal anti
- vampire weapons ofthe garlic
and silver
.
( blade dismisses a man
- portable arc lamp as being too heavy
, altough it looks to be a more efficient tool to dispatch vampires
.
) unfortunately
, the guiding h
and of john woo is absent from this film
, relegating blade tothe the status ofthe tyhe relpacement killers
, whcih it most strongly resembes
. hte replacement killers is the last movie i saw thast i didn
' t review
-
- mostly because it made noone impression on me
,
and i couldn
' t remember anything other than noise
, violence
, adn the intensity ofthe fat
' s performance
. blade has a little mroe gonig for it
, annd hasnt the vampire myth tothe draw ffrom
-
-
but other thna that
, it
' s the same kind of movie
-
- exciting
, with well choreographed action scenes
,
but with noone resonance
. wiht a stronger villin
( stephen dorff is
( pardon the pun
) curiously bloodless as tjhe head vampire
, leaving us to wonder wqat denis leary might have done wih teh role
)
, a wittier script
, anbd a storng supporting cast
, blade might have beeen able to rise beyond the level of commonplace summer enteratinment
. as it isnt
, blade isnt an average action movie that serves to dont nothing
but remind us that the summer movies just keep getting dumber annd the vampire movies just keep multiplying
.
