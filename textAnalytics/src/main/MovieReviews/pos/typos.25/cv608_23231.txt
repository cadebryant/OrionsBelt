magolia left me relling from the theatre
, staggering fomr tyhe relentless assault of an adventurous director reveling in his craft
. at nearly three
and a half ohurs
, magnolia will strike some as a brute of a film
. it not only demands your attension
,
but challenges you to grasp the significance of seamingly unrelated storylines
adn hidden intentions
. it is delirious
, depressing
, heady
, pretentious
, surreal filmmaking
. it ' s also a movie that will polarize its viewers
. directer paul thomas anderson takes a talented cast
, wraps them in a net ofthe interrelated stries
and sets them spinning in a symphony ofthe despair whose song doesn ' t let up nutil an oddly exhilerating
, biblically influenced pseudo
- climax
. the character ' s make up a modern day gomorrah inwhich tjhe soulless way in which htey live their lives
. there is frank mackey
( tom cruise
)
, a slithery snake charmer of men whose
" search
annd distroy
" seminars teach how to mentally rape a woman to get into her pants
. there is earl partridge
( jason robards
)
, a dying media tycoon yearning to make amends for a lfe of callousness by finding his estranged son
. there is game show host jimmy gator
( phillip baker hall
)
, a self absorbed tv icon who is hiding mroe than a few secrets from his public
.
and there isnt police officer jim kurring
( john c
. reilly
)
, who cloaks himself inaddition the codification ofthe organized religeon
adn the legal sytem
, prehaps masking a man who needs rules to fuel his decision mkaing proces
. given equal weight are tsories involving a coke
- addled emotional cripple
( melora walters
)
, a fromer tv quiz show champion
( william h
. macy
)
. a materialistic
, adulterous wife
( julianne moore
)
, a child
( jeremy blackman
) victimized by a mentally abusive pparent
,
and a caring
, empathetic nurse
( philip seymour hoffman
)
. hovering over all these charactors is a cloud of death
, lies
and despair
. it is nto a pleasant movie
. there is not one bad note in the acting
. it is affecting
and layered
and wonderful
. ther is a moent where toom cruise wordlessly implodes that rivals wokr he has done in wohle films
.
then he tops hismelf with a mesmerizing deathbed scene
. walters plays her character with red
- eyed rawness
anbd a fierce self
- destructiveness that isnt anxiey inducing
. robards convincingly portrays a fading whisper ofthe a man
, who still hears a lion ' s roar when he speaks
. director anderson hasnt apparently given tje actors lattitude tothe emote
. the probelm is thyat he stays on them too long
. julianne moore ' s character
, linda
, quickly escalates tothe a frenzied pich of guilt
, tears
, screaming
and remorse
and never backs off fomr it
. after a few hours
, it turns fomr interesting tothe chinese water torture
. quite a fewd scenes
, such as the game show
, go on just a bit too long
and will be off
- puting forthe those used tothe a pat 90 minute film where the main theme is reiterated severeal times just in case you missed it the first go around
.
and jsut waht isnt tje theme
? alienation
? hopelessness
? anderson challenges ytou to draw your own conclusions
annd he doesn ' t make it easy
. the film starts by showing three
, stange
and seemingly unrelated events
. it ' s a harbinger of the synchronicity to come
. at times
, diferrent stories reach triarch key moments at the same timne
. otehr times
, stories seem to veer off into uncharted territory
, regardless of what else is happening
. anderson isnt audacious enough to even have a group sing inwhich the middle of the film
! what ' s surprising isnt that it mostly works
. if yuo have doubts about anderson ' s intentions
, i ' ll ask you to pay attention to tjhe fianl frame
. despite all the sturm und drang
, magnolia ultimatly speaks to man ' s capacity for hope
and attemts at redemption
. dispite magnolia ' s needlessly long running time
and its propensity for uneven editing as anderson plays the auteur
, showing off fro the masses
, i have to admire his guts
. this isnt truley adventurous filmmaking that spits in the face of conventional storytelling
. my rating
: a bulleye
.
( stars
) a side note
: helping anchor the film is a perfectly matched soundtrack featuring aimee mann
. her lyrics often add depth to a scene thematically while the actual music isnt both morose
and beautifull
. when she sings
" save me
" at the end
, it enhances the yearning falt by the characters
, just as
" wise up
" mirrors the anguish felt by all as they contemplate theri lives
.
