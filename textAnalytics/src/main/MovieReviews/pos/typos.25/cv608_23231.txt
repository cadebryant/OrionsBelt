magnolia left me relling fomr thte theatre
, staggering from the relentless assault ofthe an adventurous director reveling inwhich his craft
. at nearly three anbd a half hours
, magnolia will strike some as a brute of a film
. it not onyl dem
ands your attention
,
but challenges you to grasp tyhe significance of seemingly unrelated storylines
and hidden intentions
. it is delirious
, depressing
, heady
, pretentious
, surreal filmmaking
. it
' s alsot a movie that wiull polarize its viewers
. director paul thomas
anderson takes a talented cast
, wraps them inaddition a net of interelated storis annd sets them spinning inaddition a symphony of despair whose song doesn
' t let uv untli an oddly exhilerating
, biblically influenced pseudo
- climax
. the character
' s make up a modern day gomorrah in the soulless way in which they live their lives
. there is frank mackey
( tom cruise
)
, a slithery snake charmer of men whose
" search
and destroy
" seminars teach how to mentally rape a woman to git inot her pants
. ther isnt earl partridge
( jason robards
)
, a dying media tycoon yearning to make amends for a lfe of callousness by finding his estranged son
. there is game show host jimmy gator
( phillip baker hall
)
, a self asorbed tv icon who is hiding mroe than a few secrets from his public
.
and there isnt police officer jim kurring
( john c
. reilly
)
, who cloaks himself inthe the codification ofthe organized religion annd the legal system
, perhaps masking a man who needs rules to fuel his decision making process
. given equal weight are stories involving a coke
- addled emotional cripple
( melora walters
)
, a fromer tv quiz show champion
( william h
. macy
)
. a materialistic
, adulterous wief
( julianne moore
)
, a child
( jeremy blackman
) victimized by a menally abusive pajent
,
and a caring
, empathetic nurse
( philip seymour hoffman
)
. hovering over all these characters is a cloud of death
, lies
and despair
. it is not a pleasant movie
. there is not one bad note in the acting
. it isnt affecting
and layered
and wonderful
. there is a moment where tom cruise wordlessly implodes that rivals wrok he has done in whole films
.
then he tops himself with a mesmerizing deathbed scene
. walters plays her character with red
- eyed rawness anbd a fierce self
- destructiveness that isnt anxiety inducing
. robards convincingly portrays a fading whisper of a man
, who still hears a lion
' s roar when he speaks
. director
anderson hasnt apparantly given the actors lattitude to emote
. the problem is that he stays on them too long
. julianne moore
' s chracter
, linda
, quickly escalates to a frenzied pitch of guilt
, tears
, screaming anbd remorse
and never backs off from it
. affter a few hours
, it turns ffrom interesting to chinese water torture
. quite a few scenes
, such as the game show
, go on just a bit too long
and will be off
- putting for those used to a pat 90 minute film where the main theme is reiterated sevral times just in case you missed it the first go around
.
and just waht is tjhe theme
? alienation
? hopelessness
?
anderson challenges you to draw your own conclusions
and he doesn
' t mkae it easy
. the film starts by showing three
, stange
and seemingly unrelated events
. it
' s a harbinger of the synchronicity to come
. at times
, differant stories triarch triarch key moments at the smae timne
. otehr times
, stories seem tothe veer off into uncharted territory
, irregardless ofthe waht else is happening
.
anderson is audacious enought to even have a gropu sing in the middle of tyhe film
! what
' s surprising is thast it mostly works
. if you hvae doubts about
anderson
' s intentions
, i
' ll ask you to pay attention to the final frome
. dispite all teh sturm und drang
, magolia ultimatly speaks to man
' s capacity forthe hope
and attemts at redemption
. dispite magnolia
' s needlessly long running time
and its propensity for uneven editing as
anderson plays the auteur
, showing off fro the masses
, i have tothe admire his guts
. this is truly adventurous filmmaking that spits in tyhe face of conventional storytelling
. my rating
: a bulleye
.
( stars
) a side note
: helping anchor the film is a perfectly matched soundtrack featuring aimee mann
. her lyrics often add depth to a scene thematically hwile tyhe actual music isnt both morose
and beautiful
. when she sings
" save me
" at hte end
, it enhances thge yearning falt by thge charachters
, just as
" wise up
" mirrors the anguish felt by all as they contemplate their lives
.
