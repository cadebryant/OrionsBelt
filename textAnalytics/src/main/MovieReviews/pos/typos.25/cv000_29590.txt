films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success
, whther they
' re about superheroes
( batman
, superman
, spawn
)
, or geared toward kids
( casper
) or the arthouse crowd
( ghost world
)
,
but there
' s never really been a comic book like from hell before
. for starters
, it was created by alan moore
( adn eddie campbell
)
, who brang the medium to a whole new level in the mid
' 80s with a 12
- part series called teh watchmen
. to say moore
and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd
. the book
( or
" graphic novel
,
" if you wiull
) is over 500 pages long
and includes nearly 30 more that consist ofthe nothing bu footnotes
. inwhich other words
, don
' t dismiss this film baceause of its source
. if you can get past tghe whole comic book thing
, you might find anyother stumbling block infact from hell
' s directors
, albert
and allen hughes
. getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in
, well
, anything
,
but riddle me this
: who better tothe direct a film tath
' s set in the ghetto
and features realyl violent street crime than the mad geniouses behind menace ii society
? the ghetto in question isnt
, of course
, whitechapel in 1888 london
' s east end
. it
' s a filthy
, sooty place where the whores
( called
" unfortunates
"
) are starting to get a littel nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving thru their profession with surgical precision
. wehn the first stiff turns up
, copper peter godley
( robbie coltrane
, tghe world isnt not enough
) calls in inspector frederick abberline
( johnny depp
, blow
) to crack the case
. abberline
, a widower
, has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts ofthe absinthe
and opium
. upon arriving in whitechapel
, he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly
( heather graham
, say it isn
' t so
)
and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even tghe police surgeon can
' t stomach
. i don
' t think anyone needs to be briefed on jack thte ripper
, so i won
' t go into the particulars here
, other than to say moore adn campbell have a unique
and interesting theory about both tjhe identity of the killer
and hte reasons he choosed to slay
. inwhich the comic
, they don
' t bother cloaking the identity ofthe the ripper
, bu screenwriters terry hayes
( vertical limit
)
and rafael yglesias
( les mis
? rables
) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers utnil the vyre end
. it
' s funny tothe watch the locals blindly point the finger ofthe blame at jews
and indians because
, after all
, an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts
.
and from hell
' s endig had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons forthe days
(
" who holds bcak tjhe electric car
/ who made steve guttenberg a star
?
"
)
. don
' t worry
- it
' ll all make sense when you see it
. nowe onto from hell
' s appearance
: it
' s certainly dark
and bleak enough
,
and it
' s surprising to see how much omre it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did
( at times
, it seems like sleepy hollow 2
)
. the print i saw wasn
' t completelyl finished
( both color annd music had not been finalized
, so no comments about marilyn manson
)
,
but cinematographer peter deming
( don
' t say a word
) ably captures the dreariness ofthe victorian
- era london anbd helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me ofthe the crazy flashbacks infront twin peaks
, even
though the violence in tyhe film pales inthe comparison tothe that inspite tyhe black
- adn
- white comic
. oscar winner martin childs
'
( shakespeare in lvoe
) prodcution design turns the orignal prague surroundings inot one creepy place
. even the acting in from hell is solid
, with tjhe dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performence
and deftly h
andling a brittish accent
. ians holm
( joe gould
' s secret
) annd richardson
( 102 dalmatians
) log in great supporting roles
,
but the big surprise here is graham
. i cringed the first tyme she oppened her mouth
, imagining her attempt at an irish accent
, bu it actually wasn
' t half bad
. thge film
, howver
, is all good
