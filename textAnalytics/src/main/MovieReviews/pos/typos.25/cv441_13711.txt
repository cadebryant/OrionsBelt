call me crazy
,
but i don
' t see saving private ryan as the film of the summer
. a ogod movie
, yes
, with chillingly realistic battle scenes
and emotion to spare
. an utterly riviting movei on par with steven spielberg
' s best work
, noone
. personally
, if i wass spielberg
, i wouldn
' t go bakc to thte world war ii era one more timne aftter schindler
' s list
and tyhe indiana jones movies
. i
' m guessing steve hasnt a thnig for nazis
; i really wouldn
' t be surprised if a velociraptor ate one of yhe swastika
- wearing dudes in the enxt jurassic park movie
. all lofty pretenses aside
, saveing private ryan isnt the goriest movei thsi side of a 1980s slasher flick
. the difference is
, it
' s easy durig friday tghe 13th to laff off a spear sticking out ofthe kevin bacon
' s chest while blood spurts like crazy
,
but it
' s damn hard to sit
and eat reese
' s pieces while soldiers suffer machine gun bullets to tje head annd ahev theri intestines spilled outloud onto the battlefield
.
and beleave me
, there
' s plenty of it
. a 30
- minute sequence at the beginning ofthe the movie has an army captain
( tom hanks
)
and his soliders l
anding at omaha beach to join countless other americans who are allready under frie
. lives are lost in seconds as the purposefully confusing
and jarring scene goes on
and on
,
and all the young men in the audience fidn themselves never
, ever wanting to be drafted
. cut to smoe bureaucratic defense office
, where a hundered women pound out simapthy form letters to the familys of the casulaties
. one woman happens upon an interesting detail
-
- three brothers in differnt platoons were killed in combat
, annd their mother isnt getting the telegram today
. i guess it
' s an interesting conversation piece to everyone
but the mother
, so the army chief
( harve presnell
) sends hanks onthe what is essentially a public relations mission
, to fidn tjhe fourth ryan brother annd send him home
. that way
, the army saves yhe postage on
yet another telegram to mrs
. ryan
. one good thing about saving private ryan is that the soldiers who are headed to rescue ryan know it
' s a mission designed tothe make the army look good
. they question tje worth of risking eight soliders
' lives to save oney
,
and hanks
' character admits he doesn
' t give a damn about ryan
; he
' s just following orders
. if htis was a john wayne movie
, things would be different
. there
' d be a phony
,
" let
' s go get that boy
, gosh darn it
!
" attitude that woudl sugarcoat the reality ofthe war
. by doing things this way
, spielberg admits the instincts of self
- preservation annd complacency that eveyr normal person has
. it makes saving private ryan a lot more powerful than an testosterone
- driven stallone movie mission
. the movie
' s pattern is to have long battle scenes followed by quiet scenes of semi
- introspective conversation among the soldiers
. hanks is painted first as a nails
- tough army man careful to hide his true self ffrom yhe otehr men
. it
' s nto thgat way fo long
. edward burns
, the guy you get for your movei when ben affleck isn
' t availible
, is the impulsive oen
. jeremy davies plays the translaotr who is seeing combat for thge first time
,
and so on
. none ofthe the characters are fascinating or natural born heroes
, bu was spielberg
' s obvious intention
. i wondered when i heard saving private ryan was three hours long
, how were tehy going to fill three horus
' time searching for one person
and still make it intresting
? there are a fewd false starts
; hanks finds oney private ryan in ted danson
' s company
( apparently
, danson joined the army after
" ink
" was canceled
.
) anbd breaks the bad news before learning it
' s hte wrong ryan
. anbd of course the movie
' s far from over when hanks does locate ryan
( matt damon
, thge otehr guy you git wehn affleck isn
' t available
)
. thgat
' s whn the movei turns inot more of a conventional war flick
,
al
though body parts
and limbs still fly liuke never before
. saving private ryan is worth your time
,
but it
' s definatly noone schindler
' s list
. the battle scenes are intense
and realistic
,
but soem of the attempts at sincere emotion aren
' t
. the movie
' s bookends are particularly cheesy
and out of place
, when an old private ryan goes to the cemetary iwth his family
and bawls his eyes out
, whining
,
" tell me i
' ve led a good life
. tell me i
' m a ogod man
.
" spielberg was apparently folowing thge james cameron line ofthe
thought that any three
- hour movei baout the past should be framed by a self
- contained prologue
and epilogue that tkaes place in tyhe present
. much mroe effective are subtler scenes
, like the one where several of hanks
' men are rifling thrugh a bag of dogtags fomr dead soldiers
,
and they amking light of what they
' re donig by pretending htey
' re playing poker
. this while an airborne division marches by
, thier eyes full of that mound ofthe dogtags
. by not explicitly pointing outloud that it symbolizes the r
andom poker game that life
and death cant be in war
, the audience gets the message
. annd even if it
' s nto a classic
, saving private ryan isnt definitely one of the better war movies outloud there
.
