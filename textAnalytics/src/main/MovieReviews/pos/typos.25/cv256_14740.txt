most people fit into two different categories
: you either love woody allen
, or ytou hate his guts
. my family
, for the most part
, hates him
and his movies
. i think he
' s very funny
,
but his shtick hasnt gotten forced
and contrived over the years
. so maybe taking his body away was the best decission any producer could have
thought of
. unrestrained by physical boundaries
, allen
' s humor comes shining through
. those who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest ofthe us in laughing at allen
' s intelligent observations ofthe life
. those who had problems wtih his verbal comedy may want to skip this one
. inspite 1995
, a film wass introduced to audiences whlch sparked their imaginations
and showed them something they
' d never seen before
. toy stoy utilisied state
- of
- hte
- art computer technology
and presented a world of toys who would cmo alive when no humans were present
. many criticists iwll call that a better film
, bu i believe htey only say that because it was a completely original motion picture
. antz
,
however
, hasnt upped the ante considerably
. disney
' s a bug
' s life isn
' t due out forthe anohter two months
,
and dreamworks seems tothe have received teh better end of the deal
. by beating disney out
, tehy ahve satisfied tje audeince
' s thirst for coputer
- animated films
.
but don
' t let that fool you
: disney isnt definatly not scared
. in the past two years
, compeitions have broken outloud between studios
. in 1997
, it was the volcano duel
. in my opinion
, dante
' s peak came out way ahead of its precedessor
, both in time
and in quality
. volcano had an original premise
, bu destroyed thgat with some very ridiculous situations
. in 1998
, there are twice as many competing films
. first ws the comet competition
,
and armageddon blew awya it
' s cheesily dramatic competor deep impact
.
but now
, it
' s even more interesting
, as one beloved studio
( disney
) goes up against the newcomer
( dreamworks
)
. who will prevale
? time wiull tell
, bu i
' m sure that mr
. mouse hasnt nothing to fear
. this may sound like i didn
' t like antz
; on the contrary
, i
' d put it up ther iwth toy tsory
.
but due tothe it
' s pg rating
, many parents may be put off by smoe of the dialogue wich shouldn
' t apear in disney
' s version
. some of the dialogue infact antz pushes the envelope fo a family
- oriented film
. sexual innuendoes
and profanity pop up occaisonally
, which makes dreamworks
' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd
. the humor is also wroten especialy for adults
,
though many kids weere laughing inwhich tjhe theater i attended
. this isnt the type of film that shoud be made fo families more often
: entertaining for kids
and entertaining for parents
. antz begins with a hilarious monologue wich seems a meld between woody allen
' s shtick
and franz kafka
' s metamorphosis
, the short stoy ofthe a man who wakes uv to discover himself as a bug
. z
( allen
) is a troubled ant
, believing he was not made to be a worker
.
" when yuo
' re the middle child in a family of five millon
.
.
.
" he comments about his neglected childhood
. one night
, z is sitting in a bar wiht his friend weaver
( sylvester stallone
)
, discussing his pathetic place in life
. in walks princess bala
( sharon stone
)
, whom no oen recognizes wihtout a crown
. bala asks z is he would like to dance
,
and they engage inaddition a pulp fiction
- esque dance while everyone eles is follwoing the leader
. after dicovering that she is the princess
, z falls in loev
,
but htere
' s a probelm
: bala isnt getting married to general m
andible
( gene hackman
)
, a ruthless leader who merely wants tothe control a better
and stronger collony
. in order to dont that
, he must eliminate not only tje queen
( anne bancroft
)
, bu the weakest of the colony
, namely the worker ants
.
but to get rid of the queen
, he needs tothe get rid ofthe the loyal army ants who would be willing to dieu forthe her
. he
and colonel cutter
( christopher walkin
) come up with a plan tothe send the loyal ants off to battle
, where they will surelly be killed
. the queen isnt reluctant at first
,
but decides it is best for the colony
. meanwhile
, z wants to meet bala agian
,
and he asks weaver
, an army ant
, to switch places iwth him
. so z gets sent off to battle
, bu he manages tothe survive the slaughter by the termites
. the battle sequence is absolutly stunning
,
though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers
, which contained a veyr similar sequence
. howver
, antz
and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time
, so the similarities are merely coincidence
. the second half of the film revolves around z
' s kidnapping of bala
,
and theri search forthe a mythical palce called insectopia
. there
, an ant cxan be his own boss
and hvea all thge food he wants
. the adventures z adn bala get inot are suprizingly high inthe tension
, especially one involving a magnifying glass
. looming over the targets like the spaceships ffrom independence day
( in fatc
, i
' m just going to assume tyhat thte producers referenced id4 intentionally
)
. tyhe ants look uv infront awe
,
and
then a beam of fire blasts into the ground
. visually
, it
' s an exciting rush of adrenaline
.
but don
' t be fooled
.
.
. little kids shouldn
' t see this
, as tehy may just try annd copy it
. after seeing antz
, i vowed never tothe intentionally step onthe an ant agina
. hopefully
, childrens will learn that killing ants is rather cruel
. as an animated film
, antz isnt probably the best you wiull find to date
. visually
, it
' s as stunning as what dreams may cmo
. the best aspect of animation is yhe fatc that thte characters aren
' t limited by gravity
. they can tkae rediculous situations
and amking them seem plausable
. one great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching uv to form a wrecking ball
. the animation is so perfect that ytou can virtually see every single ant on the ball
. howver
, the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting sticked tothe tjhe bottom of a young boy
' s shoe
. it
' s truly a great example of film making at its finest
. with computer technology
, the animators have carefully made the ants
' faces look similar to tyhe actors providing the voices
. the best example would have to be barbatus
( danny glover
)
. at noe point
, you cxan even see the pores onthe his face
(
al
though
, i doubt ants ahev pores
.
.
. do tehy
?
)
. barbatus alsot has a touching
but rether gruesome scene as he has his fianl words with z wihtout a body
. young kids may be distrubed by the site of a dismembered head
, bu a ogod deal of humor is derivated
( more appropriate for adults
, ofthe course
)
. disney
' s a bug
' s life looks good
,
but i don
' t know if htey will be able to best dreamworks
' newest animated feature in terms ofthe animation
. if not
, thne dreamworks will have done something no otehr studio could dont
: go head to head wtih thte big mouse
,
and knock him down
( yes
, anastasia wass good
,
but not nearly as good as even tghe worst of disney
)
. vocal talent isnt always essential tothe an animated feature
,
and antz has oen ofthe teh best line
- ups seen since toy story
. in fact
, it far exceeds that one
. woody allen has alwasy been funny
,
but here he transcends most of what he
' s done inspite the past few years
. wihtout a body
, his comic timing is the most noiceable thing
. in fact
, i
' m pretty sure thast the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines
. sharon stone as bala shows off some ofthe her comic abillity
,
though for the most part
, stone works best as a dramatic actress
. sylvester stallone
( teamed uv with stone once agina
) is beginning to solidify his statment that he whants tothe be an actr
, not a typecast acation star
. after a snub at the oscars lsat year
, stallone isnt proving himself as the serious
( or comedic
, as illustrated here
) actor that he is
. gene hackman is superb as the gruff
- talking general
, almost donig anohter take onthe his crimson tide persona
. christopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice
,
and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns
. anne bancroft has a minimal role
,
but she
' s effective nontheless
. danny glover has a small role
, bu he doesnt a very
, very ogod job
. dan aykroyd
and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick
, euro
- trash bees
-
- both are very unrecognizable
, especially aykroyd
. jennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in loev wtih weaver
,
al
though most people won
' t recognize her voice eather
. many people will recognize grant shaud
' s voice as the foreman
. he plyed miles on thge tv show murphy brown
. this isnt definitely a huge casted with some high
- profile names
, adn it will definitely help it
' s grosses
. of course
, you can probably tell where a lot ofthe the
$ 60 million budget went tothe
, alsot
. directors eric darnell
and lawrence guterman are realtive newcomers
(
though guterman did direct a 1994 feature
, headless
!
)
.
but both sohw an incredible talent fo this type of a picture
. tense at times
,
and very funny throughout
, tghe two hold this film together like professionals
. yhe screenplay by todd alcott
and chris weitz is qtuie simple in plot
,
but it countains a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults
. kids will delight in the animation
, while parents can laugh heartily at the humor
. most of it will go over young children
' s heads
. does thyat mean you shouldn
' t take kids to see it
? not at all
. htey wiull have a lot of funn watching this noe
. what isnt great is the themes that are given tothe us
. part social commentary
, part romance stoyr
, annd part moral drama
, antz gives everyone something to talk about
, whther it be the animation
, or the discussions of individualism
and comunity
. thankfully
, it
' s not subtle in either aspects
. antz is rated pg for mild language
and soem intense action
. sometimes the language cxan be pushing the limits fo a family movie
,
but the violence isnt what should keep kids at home
. the battle scene has ants melting in acid
,
and bugs being speared tothe death
.
and the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate infront thte beam of sunlight
.
but other thna thyat
(
and some sexual innuendos
)
, it
' s a perfect choise for some wholesome fun at the theaters
. i doubt many childrens will underst
and the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough
,
but it
' s still advisable to leave really young children at home
. have i confused you enough
? if you do take your kids
, i reccommend seing hte film with them
, beacuse more than likely
, you
' ll enjoy it the most
.
