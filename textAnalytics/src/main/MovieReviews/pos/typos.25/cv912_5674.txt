review
- peter jackson
' s tje frighteners has recieved some notice for setting the record fo most computer effects ever in a movie
,
and still coming in at tje extremely cheap
$ 30 million price tag
.
but fo thsoe who were dismayed by this year
' s blockbusters liuke twister
and independence day
, the frighteners hasnt much more to offer than speshal effects
.
and fo thsoe worried wether or nto peter jackson would compromize tothe hollywood you cant rest easily
. the frighteners isnt as far removed from hollywood as a high
- profile movie can get
. michael j
. fox stars as frank bannister
, a con artist who can speak to ghosts
. he uses tihs abilty to setted uv a scam in a small twon where his ghost buddies scare hte hell out ofthe peple
,
then he comes
and pretends to git rid of them
. this is how he hasnt made a living ever since his wife died in a car crash 5 years ago
. frank
' s latest customers are a young couple
, played by trini alvarado annd peter dobson
. when dobson ends up dead
, alvarado starts to take an interest in fox
. bu dobson
' s spirit is still around as he refuses tothe beleive he
' s dead
. this leads to a very awkward
and amusing dinner date between fox adn alvarado
, with dobson tagging allong as a ghost
. things start getting complicated for fox whn he is acccused for a sories of murders taking place inspite tyhe twon
. fox sees someone named the soul collector crushing the heart ofthe the victims
,
but noone else cin see that
. so when fox shows up tothe try
and sive each victim
, naturally people suspect he is tjhe killer
. fox sees that alvarado is enxt on the soul collector
' s hit list
,
and tjhe last half hour ofthe the movie deals wtih fox
' s attempts to sive her from tihs evil spirit
. there are many wonderful twists
and turns inthe the screenplay writen by peter jackson
and frances walsh
. the movei starts off as a black comedy
,
and ends uv a horror
- action film
. the mix between theese genres are perfect
. no laughs are sacrificed inaddition the name ofthe horror
, anbd vice versa
. one point ofthe contention might be a lackluster socre by danny elfman
.
but that hardly seems liek a flaw when you have such a diverse cast all in top form
. michael j
. fox delivers oen of his best performances to date as a man who hides the sorrow ofthe his wife
' s death
,
and
then isnt forced to confront this later onthe
. alvarado
, looking liuke
andie macdowell
, makes a great frightened
, tough
,
and smart heroine
.
and jeffery combs
, as a paranoid fbi agent
, is brilliantly bizaare
. the frighteners never once feels like it is running long
. the first hour is as funny as any comedy this year
, anbd teh last half hour isnt as thrilling as any ofthe thge big budget blockbusters
. this movei is probaly what casper would
' ve looked like if david lynch directed it
. it
' s easily the best film of thte year
, so far
.
