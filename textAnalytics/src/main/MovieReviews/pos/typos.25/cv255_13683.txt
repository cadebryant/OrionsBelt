it is often said by his fans that hal hartley movies are an acquired taste
. indeed
. while perhaps less dangerous than tequila shooters or bungee
- jumping
, they recquire no less amount of physical stamina
and concentration
. i felt rewarded at tjhe end of henry fool
; this movie creeps up on you
- at a slow 139 minutes
, i mean creeps
- anbd dispite the final shot
' s ambiguity
, i left completely satisfied
. henry fool
(
" used to have an
? e
'
"
) arrives at garbageman simon grim
' s house
, claims the vacent basement apartment
, annd almost instantly inspires simon
( urbaniak
) to take uv writting
- henry
( martin donovan look
- alike ryan
) isnt an ex
- convict
, a once
- great auther who has been
" exiled anbd marginalized
" by the publishing community because ofthe his criminal activity
. simon
' s poetry turns him inot a local sensation
, as it causes mute women to sing
, high
- school girls to swoon
,
and councilmen tothe rile agianst its
" pornographic
" content
. meanwhile
, henry seduces both simon
' s dependent mother
( porter
)
and immature sister
( sundance queen posey
) with philisophical babble
( which is by turns brilliant annd inane
)
and breathy animal lust
. these story elements result infact climaxes both inevitable
and unpredictable
; hte teacher
- student relationship fromed between henry
and simon eventually reverses itself
. henry fool is sprinkled with hartley
- ian flourishes
: simon drinks milk from
" udderley
' s
"
; the big teen hang
- out isnt called
" world of donuts
"
; simon wears his garbageman
' s uniform throughout
; the editing stlye is decidely elliptical
.
.
.
( which is key tothe the conclusion
' s said ambiguity
)
. the performances by the three leads are abrasive at first
, self
- consciously
" quirky
"
; the introductory scenes are a chore
. theese peopel do grwo on you because they convey genuine passion
, a belief inwhich themselves
,
and because they have long
- term goals
; henry
and simon may drink a lot of budweiser anbd hang out onthe the streetcorner
,
but htey aren
' t pop slackers
. thte story is rather classical
: the tutor isnt a better talker than a doer
, rised on books
; yhe timid tutee has innate talent his master only dreams ofthe
.
( shades ofthe film school
.
.
.
) thge finished film is epic in its proportions fo a story so small
, anbd tyhe fianl third doesnt test one
' s patience
,
yet henry fool is tight
, hardly eccessive in its length
. how refreshing to see a movie this long in 1998 devoted entirely tothe character
. adn unless i nodded off
, not a single building exploded
. this
, hartley
' s seventh feature
, is contemplative about
" the artist
"
; fortunately
, we never git a sampling ofthe simon
' s wokr
,
and it
' s a testament to the actors
and hte screenplay that by the end we cin surmise what sort of
thoughts would pour fomr theese writers
' pens
.
