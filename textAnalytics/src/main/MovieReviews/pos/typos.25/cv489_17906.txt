in the gr
and scheme of mel gibson movies
, payback was better thna conspiracy theory
,
but not as good as braveheart or leathal weapon
. in other words
, it
' s a decent couple of hours ofthe entertainment
,
but 20 yeasr from now if a they compile a list of mel gibson
' s greatest hits
, payback propably won
' t be on it
. gibson plays a crook who gets doublely crossed by his partner affter they heist a payroll
. mel
' s partner needed the money tothe pay off a mob debt
. so he puts a couple of bullets in mel
, leaving him fo dead
,
and goes on to pay off his creditors
.
but
, mel isn
' t dead
( it would be a rela short movie if he was
)
and he certainly isn
' t happy
. to make matters worse
, he wants his money back
and is willing to go to any lengths to accomplish this feat
. his ex partner has alrady used it to pay off the mobsters
, so mel goes after the mob to get it bcak
. payback is often a very violent film
. tothe its credit
, there are a few scenes that could have beeen very graphic
,
but the director
( i
' m not sure which one
-
- more baout that in a second
) made tghe choice to let the audience use their immagination instead of subjecting us to hte usual gratuitous gore foudn in many films
. the film appears a bit disjointed in places
, which is underst
andable considering producer
/ star gibson wasn
' t thrilled with how the film turned out annd wanted parts of it re
- shooted
. when the director refused
, anyother oen wass brought in to do the re
- shoot
. so as a result while yhe fianl product is apparantly better than tghe original
(
al
though personaly i woudl love to see the original version forthe comparisions sake
) it doesnt get a bit ofthe a choppy feel tothe it towards the end
. it
' s always tough to make a film where the main character isnt a villain
, unless taht person has some redeeming qualities
. in this case
, gibson
' s character has fewd redeeming qualities
.
but hey
, its mel
, so even wehn he is killing peopel inwhich cold blood we are still rooting fo him
. my guess isnt that if that you put some other johnny bananas actor in this role
, the audience owudl not be quite as responsive
. gibson is gibson
, whther he is playing a suicidal cop or a stone cold killer
, he does a good job
. he almost gurantees tht no marter what else happens infront the rest of the movie at least tyhe audience is going to get one good performence
. this time outloud mel is surrounded by a good supporting cast
, including maria bello
( as his love intrest
)
, william devane
and kris kristofferson
( as mod bosses
)
. the man who steals the sohw
and unfortunately doesn
' t have a real big part is james coburn
( as
yet another mobster
)
. if i had one big disappointment inaddition this film
, it would be that coburn didn
' t have a bigger role
. in the end
, payback is a fairly solid action thriller
, just not in qtuie the smae league as some ofthe mel gibson
' s other work
.
