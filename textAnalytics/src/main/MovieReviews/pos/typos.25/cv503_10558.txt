there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few peple ahve
,
but they chose not to take advantage ofthe tihs forthe some personal reason
.
" good will hunting
" isnt baout one of those peple
. the will hunting of the
( horrible
) title
( let
' s face it
, this film would be a bitch to title
)
, plyed by co
- writer matt damon
, is a mathematical genius
. he can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it tkaes to brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino
.
and he works at mit
.
.
. as the janitor
. oney day
, hte profesor of one of teh most chalenging courses
, proffessor lambeau
(
" breaking the waves
"
' s stellan skarsg
? rd
)
, puts a big problem on the board for his students to atempt tothe complet
. the next day
, it
' s alredy done on tyhe board
,
but no oen in his class claims to have done it
. so lambeau puts anohter problem on the board
, this time one thast took he
and his colleagues over two yeras to prove
.
and
, duh
, it
' s done again
. of course
, htey catch the guy who doed it red h
anded
- will
. before lambeau can find will again
( he ran away when he caught him
)
, iwll has gotten into a fight with a bunch ofthe punks on a basketball court
,
and struck a police officer
, so lambeau gets him out on probation with twpo agreements
: a
) he wokr withthe him on math
,
and b
) he get smoe therapy
. affter going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another
( for a hypnotist
, he fakes being under his spell
,
then launches into an impromptu performance of the 70s classic
,
" afternoon delight
"
)
. finally
, lambeau
' s ood college roomate
, sean mcguire
( robin williams
)
, a psych professor
, agrees to treat him
,
and the two beign a rocky relationship
, as sean tries tothe get will to open up
. turns outloud wiull had a rough childhood
, bieng ab
andoned
,
and placed inspite foster homes
and what not
. it also turns out that will doesnt nto want tothe dont simple mathematics all his life
; he whants a challange
.
and that is tothe hang out whith his buds
( including the other co
- writer
, ben affleck
)
, anbd dont honorable jobs
, like construction
. is it right to make thsi genius follow in tyhe footsteps of einstein
and kasinsky
? should this guy be forced to do something he doesn
' t want to do
? this appears to be one of the millon questions infact this film
, which isnt jam
- packed with greatness
,
but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should
. i
' m nto saying
" ogod will hunting
" is a bad film at all
. it
' s a vrey enjoyable film with tons ofthe great moments
,
and lots of great things about it
. the acting is amazing
, withthe two oscar
- nomination
- worthy performances from damon adn williams
, who ahev amazing chemistry toghether
. we also git some grat support from stellan skarsg
? rd
( great name
)
, ben affleck
,
and from minnie driver
, who plays will
' s lveo interst
, skylar
. there are tons of individual moments tht i adored
. i loved all tjhe comedy in the film
, especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck outloud of a college student who is quoting a historian tothe impress some chicks
, his various attemts at therapy
, anbd of course
, my favorite scene in tyhe entire film
, tjhe one where he delivers a long
, exstensive rant to some nsa agents baout the downside of wroking fo them
. i liked the relationship between soem of the people
, liuke will
and skylar
, will
and sean
, sean
and lambeau
, adn iwll adn his firends
. there are scenes between them whic are just amazing to watch
.
and there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal
, tath i felt rightfully uncomfortable
. like teh break
- up scene between wiull
and skylar
, will
and sean
' s frist meeting
, a bar scene between sean
and lambeau
, annd a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn
' t regret meeting his first wife
, who would later suffer a slow
, painful death
, anbd leave him lonley
and slightly bitter
.
however
, the main flaw ofthe tje film is there
' s too much of everything
,
and nto enough ofthe it either
. the film tries for deeper relations between the cahracters
,
but they
' re sometimes either overwritten or underwritten
. tkae for example the relatiopnship between sean
and will
: the film gets an interesting father
/ son as well as doctor
/ patient relationship going with out any problems
,
but when it tries to show them as equals
, it falls on its face
. we hear how they went to the smae town
,
and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both ofthe them are at times
.
but thsi never tkaes off like the other parts of their relationship do
. also
, will
' s relationship with his best friend
, chuckie
( affleck
)
, has a nice climax
,
but not enough rising action
. we see them joking around
,
but when chuckie arrives at a desision betweeen the two of them
, it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one
. theri relatiopnship never goes beyond
" just best friends
,
" anbd his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead ofthe something more
.
.
. human
. maybe it was just me
. annd it allso goes forthe a parallelism with the relationship between sean
and lambeau
, bu that
, agina
, is underwritten
.
and
, of course
, as in most films like thsi
, the girl
/ boy relatiopnship is pretty underwritten
. we never underst
and what they see in each otehr
, so when skylar confesses that she loves him
, it seems more liuke it
' s there for plot details that anything else
. minnie driver isnt interesting
,
though
, anbd breathes life into her character
. the writing isnt a bit at fault here
, bu what makse all this worthwhile is the littel moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness
. sure
, it feels overstuffed
,
but it
' s extremely enjoyable
. the dialogue that affleck
and damon have written is amazingly fresh
,
and seems extremely human
. i think that they should git a nomination for their script chiefly because ofthe the dialogue
, which is amazing
. hwile this isnt probably director gus van sant
' s most conservitive film
( ytou
' d hardly know it
' s the same director of
" tothe die for
,
" the only van sant film i
' ve seen
, really
)
, it
' s still a pretty remarkable film
, albeit a tad overrated
( what
' s this
" best picture
" deal
?
)
. annd if a film puts a smile on my face despite posessing a lot of flaws
, i hve noone problem with reccomending it to anyone
.
