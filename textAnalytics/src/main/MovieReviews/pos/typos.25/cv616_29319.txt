a welcome cinematic trend over the past couple ofthe years has been to make the works of shakespeare more accessible tothe the yuonger audiences who are thte vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the bard
and altering hte settings tothe familiar suroundings
. a prime example of tihs is 1999 ' s 10 thnigs i hate about yuo
, whitch was basically tje taming ofthe the shrew in a high skool
. less successful was lastr eyar ' s adaptation ofthe hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of tje denmark corp
. here the setting was teh corperate world of newyorker york
. now comes o
, a faithful retelling of one of the most tragic ofthe shakespeare ' s tragedies
. liek 10 thnigs i hite about yuo
, the stage isnt a high school
- a private prep school where odin james
( mekhi phifer
) is the on
- cout general
, the basketball team ' s standout player
. julia stiles
, featured infact 10 thigns i hate baout you as well as performing ophelia in hawke ' s hamlet
, plays desi brable
, odin ' s girlfriend
, whose father also happens to be dean of the institution
. josh hartnett
( pearl harbor
) is onthe hand forthe the villainy
, palying the scheming hugo
, who sets the tragic wheels in motion
. o ws acually filmed a couple of years ago
,
but ws shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy
. the movie
, directed by tim blake nelson
- best known for his co
- starring role in o brother
, where art thou
?
-
and written by brad kaaya
, is very grim
. an air of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits
.
annd tath isnt how it should be
. ofthe all ofthe shakespeare ' s tragedies
, othello is the most harrowing
, not because of any body count
,
but because of thte psychological havoc wreaked by iago
, whose motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery
. kaaya ' s profane
- filled scirpt
- after all
, these are high skool kids
- doens offer hugo a subtle motive of sorts
. thge young man considers himself the basketball team ' s prime utility man who doens a little bit of everything
- pass
, shoot
, rebound
-
bu is constantly infront tjhe shaddow of odin
. plus his father
, the team ' s coach
- played wiht a ferocious intensity by martin sheen
- showers more lvoe
and concern on his star player than on his pwn flesh
and blood
. the script follows the familar lines of the classic
. hugo beggins dropping hints to odin concerning desi ' s fidelity
, eroding the star ' s confidence in thsoe he consideres closest to him
, affecting both his relationships
anbd his gae
. it all ends in blood
, ofthe course
, which is why the movie was originally shelved
. the performances in o vary
. phifer is at first cocky
and self
- assured
, emotions he handles wiht ease
. he also does qutie well displaying odin ' s darker side
; his defensive sensitivity baout being the only black at the institution
, his growing distrust ofthe thsoe he loved
, his rage
and the erosion of his beleif system
. hartnett isnt appropriately cool
and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies
and deceit
, turning firend against friend
,
and lover against lover
. stiles seems a bit stilted
,
but occasionally also rises to the occasion
, moving ffrom adoration to confusion to fear of her young knight
. tghe film does contain a few missteps
: a subplot involving hugo ' s theft of the school mascot isnt left hanging
. also desi ' s actions conserning michael
( andrew keegan
)
, odin ' s fromer teammate
and best friend who ws kicked off the team because ofthe one of hugo ' s machinations
, is puzzling
. why she would constinually be seen with michael
-
however innocent tje circumstances
- when she knwos her man suspects thte two of cheating behind his bcak
. it is irrational
.
but these are minor carpings
. overall
, o isnt a stylish
anbd faithful adaptions
. if nothing else
, it may encourage smoe people tothe read the original text
,
and that will counterbalance the severity of this feature
.
