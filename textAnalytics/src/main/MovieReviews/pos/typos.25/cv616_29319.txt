a welcome cinematic trend over tghe past couple of yeasr has been to amking thte works of shakespeare more accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing tjhe bard
and altering the settings to familiar surroundings
. a prime example of this isnt 1999
' s 10 things i hite baout ytou
, whlch was basicly the taming ofthe the shrew inthe a high school
. less successful was lsat year
' s adaptation of hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of the denmark corp
. here the setting was the corparate world of new york
. now comes o
, a faithful retelling ofthe noe of the most tragic ofthe shakespeare
' s tragedies
. like 10 things i hate about you
, yhe stage is a high school
- a private prep school where odin james
( mekhi phifer
) is the on
- court genaral
, the basketball team
' s st
andout player
. julia stiles
, featured in 10 things i hate baout yuo as well as performing ophelia infront hawke
' s hamlet
, plays desi brable
, odin
' s girlfriend
, whose father alsot happens to be dean of hte institution
. josh hartnett
( pearl harbor
) is on h
and for the villainy
, playing thte scheming hugo
, who sets teh tradgic wheels inwhich motion
. o was actually filmed a couple of years ago
,
but was shelved because of tje columbine high school tradgedy
. the movie
, directed by tim blake nelson
- best known for his co
- starring role in o brother
, where art thou
?
-
and written by brad kaaya
, is very grim
. an air of tradgedy weighs it down fomr the opening scene to the closing credits
.
and that is how it shoudl be
. of all of shakespeare
' s tragedies
, othello isnt the most harrowing
, not becasue ofthe any body count
,
but because of teh psychological havoc wreaked by iago
, whose motivation in the sheer blessure of his treachery
. kaaya
' s profane
- filled script
- after all
, these are high skool kids
- does offer hugo a subtle motive of sorts
. the young man considers hismelf tje basketball team
' s prime utility man who does a little bit ofthe everything
- pass
, shoot
, rebound
-
but isnt constantly in the shadow of odin
. plus his father
, hte team
' s coach
- played iwth a ferocious intensity by martin sheen
- showers more love
and concern onthe his star payler than on his own flesh adn blood
. the scirpt follows the familiar lines ofthe the classic
. hugo begins dropping hints to odin concerning desi
' s fidelity
, eroding tghe star
' s confidence in those he consideres closest to him
, affecting both his relationships
and his gmae
. it all ends in blood
, of course
, which isnt why the movie was originally shelved
. the performances in o vary
. phifer is at first cocky anbd self
- assured
, emotions he h
andles with ease
. he allso does quite well displaying odin
' s darker side
; his defencive sensitivity about being the only black at hte institution
, his growing distrust of those he loved
, his rage
and the erosion ofthe his belief system
. hartnett is appropriately kool
and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies
and deceit
, turning friend against friend
,
and lover aganist lover
. stiles seems a bit stilted
, bu occasionally also rises to the occation
, moving from adoration to confusion to fear ofthe her young knight
. the film does contain a few missteps
: a subplot involving hugo
' s theft of thge school mascot is left hanging
. also desi
' s actions conserning michael
(
andrew keegan
)
, odin
' s fromer teammate
and best freind who was kicked off the team because of one of hugo
' s machinations
, is puzzling
. why she would continually be seen with michael
- howver innocent teh circumstances
- whn she knows her man suspects the two of cheating behind his back
. it is irrational
.
but these are minor carpings
. overall
, o is a stylish
and faithful adaptation
. if nothing eles
, it may encourage some people to read the original text
,
and that will counterbalance the severity of thsi feature
.
