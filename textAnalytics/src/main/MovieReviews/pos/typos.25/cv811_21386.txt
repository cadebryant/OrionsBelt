" waht doens it take to play carnagie hall
? practice
.
" it takes twpo hours forthe music of the heart tothe
" play carnegie hall
,
" both figuratively annd literally
. like the children it portrays
, the movie starts from the dark realms ofthe awful cinema adn works its way uv tothe a show
- stopping performance at the legendary concert hall
. roberta guaspari
( academy award winner meryl streep
) hasnt twpo kids
, a husban who left her anbd 50 violins she buyed from a small shop in the mediterranean
. her life desperately needs a jump strat anbd gets noe wehn she meets a man who introduces her tothe a job as a music teacher at an east harlem elementary school
. she soon finds her job is on the rocks as the men in her life continue tothe rotate through revolving doors
. thta is thge pattern
- liek plot ofthe thsi production
. ultimatly
, the film chooses a zero
- sum answer to these problems annd finds her music career at an all
- tiem high when teh men inaddition her life fianlly vanish
. tyhe first hour of music of the heart is rether painful
. roberta
' s charactor lacks development
and consenquently seems tothe be flat
. aslo lacking depth isnt the film
' s
" bad guy
,
" a narrow
- minded music teacher
( josh pais
) who rejects roberta out ofthe priciple
( hte movie never explains exactlly which principle that is
)
and conveniently comes
and goes ffrom the plot according to wehn it might be dramatic tothe hvae a villain around
. the enxt 15 minutes of the film are mediocre
. tehy are highlighted by one child
' s return tothe roberta
' s class
( coming after the graet old hollywood scene where he explains be cin
' t be around anymore because
" my mom said
.
.
.
"
)
and a glowing concert
. not knowing the runing time
, yuo may expect the credits to role at this point
.
but they don
' t
. instade the film uses the next 45 minutes to finish its journey from bad to mediocre to excellent
. directer wes craven
, known for his works of horror
, uses some old sentimental tricks to get the audience tearing
. one romantic break up scene is highlighted by the classic
"
but
.
.
. lastr nigth
.
.
.
" anbd roberta
' s two children also have textbook conflicts with their single mother regarding their father
' s absence
. the city of harlem plays a strong role infront the movie
. roberta
' s mother is initially reluctant to see her duaghter move to that part ofthe town
and the film does nothing tothe combat thgat stereotype
. the noise tracks for theese scenes are dominated by sirens
; predictably noe ofthe roberta
' s students is gunned down
and killed off screen
. one thign the film does lack is subtlety
. the fact that a little boy ws playing
" we shall overcome
" on his violin after the aforememtioned shooting was a cute anbd discreet refeernce
. the fatc tyhat the entire orchestra begins to play it over anbd over soon after is an overdone reference that shows how little credit he gives the audience
.
( of course
, in horror films the foreshadowing
and between
- the
- line moments are meant tothe be overdone
, so perhaps he too is jstu learning to play the game
.
) even with all its flaws
, music of tghe heart is a beautiful film
. that is not an excuse for the movie
' s poore beginning
. bu as i watched tje scenes in carnegie hall
, i
thought of some of the great acts tath hve taken that stage
. infact december of 1979 a comedian named
andy kaufman put onthe a show tath will forever be remembered as oney ofthe the most original in theatre history
. the performance included a dead
- onthe elvis impression
, robin williams in disguise annd a moment at the end when kaufman announced he would take the whole audience outloud for milk
and cookies
. so
, how did htis comic genuis choose tothe open thte show of his life
? he hadnt a character named tony clifton take the stage for the sole purpose of irritating anbd angering the audeince
. perhasp it isnt okay for music of the heart to strat off rusty beacuse just as kaufman hadnt santa
' s favorite food
, this movie has an amazing finale
.
