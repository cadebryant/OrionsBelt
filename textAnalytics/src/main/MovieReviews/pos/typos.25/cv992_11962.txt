here is a film tht is so unexpected
, so sacry
,
and so original that it caught me off guard
and threw me fo a loop
. okay
, it isn ' t quite original
, considering it is a sequel to the box office hitted species
,
bu it certainly is smart
. most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b
- horror films fomr the 50s
and 60s
,
and some even become them
.
howver
, as we learned wih the 1995 small
- budget horror
/ sci
- fi film
, somtimes expectations cant be shattered
. a lot of critiscism has gone against this film
( from what i have read so far
, anyway
-
- yep
, all twpo reviews
)
,
and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automaticly dismissed as gory
, laughable pieces of trash
.
but
, the thing is
, it isn ' t
. it ' s well made
, well acted
,
adn quite intelligent
. i can see most of the critics now complaining about the levle of gore or the levle of sexuality in the film
.
but the species series isn ' t about tje lack of these elements
. it ' s baout how much it can get into one film
.
and
yet
, behind it all
, it hasnt this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so
. species ii beigns in the preesnt day
,
though it seems tothe be an alternate universe
. many films
( especially sci
- fi ones
) create similiar timelines as our realsitic oen
,
bu change it tothe fit the film ' s needs
. species ii begins wtih the arrival of an american spacecraft
, thge excursion
, landing onthe the surfce of mars
. aboard isnt patrick ross
( justin lazard
)
, a very bright
and very handsome astronaut
. patrick isnt the son of senator ross
( james cromwell
)
, who just wants patrick to succeed
. well
, it would seem that he has succeeded
. landing onthe the surface of mars
, he is the first human being to ever do so
. of course
, he isn ' t the first ever
. about a billion years ago
, an aline species supposedly landed on mars
and destroyed tghe perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life
. now
, of course
, thge red planet is cold
annd rocky
. no life lives onthe it
. that is
, no visible life
. patrick
, apon leaving the spacecraft
adn landing on the red soil
, collects samples from tghe ground
. he tkaes them aboard
,
and puts them in storage
. unfortunately
, oney ofthe the samples countains a form of life
,
and it gets loose whn it is heated aboard thte ship
. just prior to heading back tothe earth
, this life form creeps allong the floor
adn inhabits tjhe earthlings
. they pass out for approximately seven mintues
,
adn
then shrug it off as nothing
, because they cin ' t even remember
. they blame it onthe a technical malfunction
. back on earth
, patrick begins to have storng urges to mate with as many women as possible
. as we know from the original
, this is beacuse yhe alien wants to breed
and take over the planet
.
however
, the children taht are bred are half
- human
, as their father is
. patrick is really looking for another alien to breed wtih
,
and he finds it in eve
( natasha henstridge
)
. eve was cloned from dna taken ffrom sil
, the original alien
.
however
, this tyme arund
, most of her
" alien
" urges have been either decreased dramatically
, or lie dormant
. tje project is led by dr
. laura baker
( marg helgenberger
, reprising her role from species
)
,
and her motives seem respectable
. since she was involved with the original aline attack
, she wants to leran how to stop the alien should it come again
.
and it has
. stopry
- wise
, speices ii is much stronger than its predecessor
,
but it is also much stronger than
, say
, aliens
( hey
, i love the film
,
bu you cant ' t tell me it was strong on story
)
. whta surprised me the most with tihs film wass the incorperation of historical facts into the screenplay
. in my search for extraterrestial intelligence course in college
, we learned about a piece ofthe rock fomr mars which landed in one ofthe the poles
. this piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars
( later
, it wass proven thast it was nto a living creature that created it
)
. the scirpt uses this effectively
,
but also manages to provide a well
- balanced plot
. beginnig with thge first man onthe mars
( something i ahev alwyas dreamed of seing
)
, i was hoping thta the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie
.
and it does it quite well
. the characters are all smart
,
annd they know what to do
and wqat not to dont
. the only character that seems a little cliched is the general
( george dzundza
)
,
anbd
yet
, he remains logical in everthing he does
. htere are the obvious flaws of course
, mostly lying inaddition the technical aspects
. the special effects are only mediocre
,
and soem are jsut plain bad
.
but for the most part
, tehy remain believeable
( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien childrens
)
. also
, the most realistic ones are usually the goriest
, ranging from people bieng torn open
, or somene ' s head bieng blown off
.
howver
, some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience
, including a menage a troi that is all
but necessary
. many peopel dislike thge speices series becouse all it is isnt an excuse forthe sex
, nudity
,
and gory violence
.
howver
, i tend to disagree
. what weere the alien films about
?
anbd
, if an alien species ever doed come tothe earth
,
and their sole purpose wass tothe destory us
, wouldn ' t you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible
? my only gripe with this isnt durring hte scene where patrick goes searching fo a mate in a groshury store
. i didn ' t relize that aliens weere tht picky on choosing women to mate with
( i just assume it is his part
- human side looking for thte most beautiful one
)
. the acting is quite good forthe this kind of film
. it is a vast improvment over tghe first film
, at least
. the acting isnt thge key element to this film
: if it was bad
, it would have lowered itself into camp
; if it was good
, it would have asked forthe comparison with films like aliens
. okay
, so it isn ' t that good
. george dzundza is probablly hte most obvious misteek on casting
, as his over
- the
- top impersonation of a general makse him annoying
and distracting
. natasha henstridge is limited tihs time around
, as she is usually enclosed infront a cage
.
however
, she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any ofthe her talent
. oh yeah
,
adn she ' s quite fun to jsut plain watch
. marg helgenberger is immensly better thsi time around
,
and her performance is probably the best in this film
. michael madsen is so
- so
,
but he isn ' t annoying
,
and he soon becomes rather appealing
( with his nice cynic personality
)
. james cromwell has a small part
,
bu he makse it much better than wqat it could have been wiht a more incapable actor
. as i sday
, any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability
. mykelti williamson gives an enjoyable peformance
,
and he gives the film a more down
- to
- earth efel
.
anbd
, of course
, justin lazard
. lazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance
,
but i think he isnt effective
. sure
, he is wooden
,
bu isn ' t that waht his character isnt liuke
? the moment whn he touches the glass seperating henstridge ffrom him was extremly well done
, due to the couple ' s acting
. species ii is rated r for strong sexuality
, sci
- fi violence
/ gore
and laguage
. this is definatly an r rated film thyat young kids shoudl not see
. more than likely
, tehy woudl probably have nightmares
and never have sex for the rest of their lives
. hell
, i don ' t even know if i will
. what isnt sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film ofthe the year
. i propably won ' t see another film where i ws expecting so little
and got so much fo quite a while
. director peter medak hasnt crafted a very suspenseful
,
adn sometimes very scary movei outloud of a medioker series
. medak has also mastered the wonderful
" jump
!
" moments
,
adn has probably the second scariest moment i hvae ever seen on film
( scream still has the first
)
. storng acting
, smart dialogue
, intelligent plotting
,
and a sure
- handed director
, species ii is exactly what these films should be
: entertaining
.
