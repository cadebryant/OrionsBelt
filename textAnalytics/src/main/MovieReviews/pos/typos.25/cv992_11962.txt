here is a film that isnt so unexpected
, so scary
,
and so original that it caught me off guard
and threw me for a loop
. okay
, it isn
' t qutie origonal
, considering it is a sequel to hte box office hit speices
,
but it certainly is smart
. most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b
- horror films from tje 50s
and 60s
,
and smoe even become them
. howver
, as we learned with the 1995 small
- budget horror
/ sci
- fi film
, sometimes expectations can be shattered
. a lot of criticism has gone against this film
( from what i have read so far
, anyway
-
- yep
, all two reviews
)
, anbd it mkaes me wonder why theese types ofthe films are automaticly dismissed as gory
, laughable pieces of trash
.
but
, thte thing is
, it isn
' t
. it
' s well made
, well acted
,
and quite intelligent
. i can see most of the critics now complaining baout tjhe levle of gore or the level of sexuality in the film
.
but the species series isn
' t baout the lack of these elements
. it
' s about how much it can get into one film
.
and
yet
, behind it all
, it has this basic premise that allows it to git awya wih doing so
. species ii begins in the present day
,
though it seems to be an alternate universe
. many films
( expecially sci
- fi ones
) create similar timelines as our realsitic one
,
but chanage it to ift the film
' s needs
. species ii begins with the arival of an american spacecraft
, tje excursion
, l
anding onthe the surface of mars
. aboard is patrick ross
( justin lazard
)
, a very bright
and very hansome astronaut
. patrick is tyhe son ofthe senator ross
( james cromwell
)
, who just wants patrick to succede
. well
, it owudl seem that he hasnt succeeded
. l
anding on the surface of mars
, he is the first human bieng to ever do so
. of course
, he isn
' t tyhe first ever
. about a billion years ago
, an alien species supposedly l
anded on mars
and destroyed teh perfect living conditions that weere able to sustain life
. now
, of course
, the red planet is cold adn rocky
. no life lives on it
. tyhat isnt
, noone visible life
. patrick
, upon leaving the spacecraft
and l
anding onthe hte red soil
, collects samples from tjhe ground
. he takes them aboard
,
and puts them in storage
. unfortunately
, oen ofthe the samples containes a form of life
,
and it gets loose whn it isnt heated aboard hte ship
. just prior to heading back tothe earth
, this life form creeps along yhe floor
and inhabits the earthlings
. tehy pass out for approxamately seven mintues
,
and
then shrug it off as nothing
, becuase they can
' t even remember
. they blame it on a technical malfunction
. bcak on earth
, patrick beigns tothe have storng urges tothe mate iwth as many womens as possibile
. as we know ffrom the original
, this is becasue the alien wants to breed
and tkae over the planet
.
however
, yhe children thast are bred are half
- human
, as their father is
. patrick is really looking fo anohter alien to breed whith
,
and he finds it infront eve
( natasha henstridge
)
. eve was cloned fomr dna taken fomr sil
, thge original aline
.
however
, this time around
, most of her
" alien
" urges have beeen eather decreased dramatically
, or lie dormant
. the project is led by dr
. laura baker
( marg helgenberger
, reprising her role from species
)
,
and her motives seem respectable
. since she was involved with the originnal aline attack
, she wants to leran how to stop the alien should it come again
.
and it has
. stor
- wise
, species ii is much stronger than its predecessor
,
but it is alsot much stronger than
, say
, aliens
( hey
, i love tghe film
,
but you can
' t tell me it wass strong on story
)
. waht surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts inot the screenplay
. inspite my search for extraterrestial intelligence course inwhich college
, we learned about a piece of rock fomr mars whlch l
anded in noe of the poles
. this peice of rock contained fossils hwihc may have been proof ofthe life on mars
( later
, it ws proven that it was not a living creature thta creaeted it
)
. the scirpt uses this effectively
, bu allso manages to provide a well
- balanced plot
. beginning with the frist man on mars
( something i have always dreamed of seeing
)
, i wass hoping that thge film would turn this element into a useful starting point forthe the movie
.
and it does it qtuie well
. the cahracters are all smart
, annd tehy know whta tothe dont
and whta not to do
. the only character tyhat seems a little cliched isnt the general
( george dzundza
)
,
and
yet
, he remeniss logical in everything he does
. there are teh obvious flaws ofthe course
, mostly lying iin the technical aspects
. the special effects are only medicore
,
and soem are just plain bad
.
but for the most part
, they reamain believable
( i even noticed a homage tothe the aline series when the mothers gave birth tothe alien children
)
. also
, the most realsitic ones are usually tjhe goriest
, ranging fomr people being torn opn
, or someone
' s head bieng blown off
. howver
, smoe plot elements aslo may elicit laughs from the audience
, including a menage a troi that is all
but neccessary
. many peple dislike the species series beacuse all it is isnt an excuse for sex
, nudity
,
and gory violentce
.
however
, i tend to disagree
. what were the alien films about
? anbd
, if an aline species ever doed cmo to earth
, anbd theri sole purpose was to destroy us
, wouldn
' t you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible
? my only gripe with thsi is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery stroe
. i didn
' t relize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate wiht
( i just assume it is his part
- human side looking for the most beautyfull one
)
. the acting is quite good for this kind of film
. it isnt a vast improvement over the first film
, at least
. the acting is teh key element to this film
: if it was bad
, it would have lowered itself inot camp
; if it was good
, it woudl have asked for comparsion with films like aliens
. okay
, so it isn
' t that good
. george dzundza is probably thte most obvious mistake on casting
, as his over
- the
- top impersonation of a genaral makes him annoying
and distracting
. natasha henstridge isnt limited this time around
, as she is usually enclosed in a cage
.
however
, she doesnt manage a very impressive performance wtih this aspect hindering any ofthe her talent
. oh yeah
,
and she
' s quite fun to just plain watch
. marg helgenberger is immensly better this time around
,
and her performance is propably hte best inspite this film
. michael madsen is so
- so
,
but he isn
' t annoying
,
and he soon becomes rather appealling
( with his nice cynic perosnality
)
. james cromwell hasnt a small part
,
but he makes it much better than waht it could have been with a more incapable actor
. as i say
, any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability
. mykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance
,
and he gives the film a omre down
- to
- earth efel
. annd
, of course
, justin lazard
. lazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance
,
but i htikn he isnt effective
. sure
, he is wooden
,
but isn
' t that what his character isnt like
? the moent whn he touches thte glass separating henstridge ffrom him wass extremly well done
, due to thge cuple
' s acting
. speices ii is rated r for storng sexuality
, sci
- fi violence
/ gore anbd langauge
. this is definitely an r rated film that young kids should nto see
. mroe than likely
, tehy owudl probably have nightmares annd never hvea sex fo the rest ofthe their lives
. hell
, i don
' t even nkow if i iwll
. what is sure tothe be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year
. i probably won
' t see anyother film where i ws expecting so little
and got so much for quite a while
. director peter medak has crafted a vrey suspenseful
,
and sometimes vrey scary movie out of a mediocre series
. medak has also mastered the wonderful
" jump
!
" moments
, adn has probably the second scariest moent i have ever seen on film
( scream still hasnt the firt
)
. strong acting
, smart dialogue
, intelligent plotting
,
and a sure
- h
anded directer
, species ii is exactly what these films shouldnt be
: entertaining
.
