" tghe endurance
: shackleton
' s legendary antartic expedition
" in 1914
, as tje great war descended apon europe
, sir ernest shackleton began his thrid expedition tothe antarctica
, this time to be the first tothe cross the ice
- binded continent on foot
. 28 men set sail on the brigantine endurace
and tehy would nto be heard from agian for nearly twpo years
. director george
butler
, using film footage
and photographs from the historic journey
, tells their remarkable story in
" the endurance
: shackleton
' s legendary antarctic expedition
.
" the expedition started outloud as a merely incredibly difficult quest tothe traverse
, on foot
, the vast wastel
and of antarctica
. as the intrepid ship
and crew entered the weddell sea
, hte entry tothe tyhe cold
, cruel continent
, htey did nto plan on tje dense pack ice bringing the voyage tothe an abrupt halt as the endurance became trapped within sight of l
and
. fo months the ice thickened annd compressed until hte ship ws crushed
, str
anding the men on the flow
, propeling them away from their goal
and
, eventually
, into their lifeboats for safety
. shackleton
, faced witht a desolate situation
, made the decision tothe lead the threee tiny boats to the relative safety of uninhabited elephant isl
and
. once onthe this
" safe
" haven
, shackleton next turned his sights to saving his crew adn retruning them to civilization
. he
and five of his men leave the isl
and inspite an opne boat tothe make the 800 mile journey on the world
' s roughest sea to git help ffrom the nearest inhabited isl
and of south georgia
. miraculously
, the six l
and
, affter 17 days at sea
, on tghe uninhabited side of tjhe target isl
and
and are forced to trek across treacherous
, snow covered mountains
, covering 22 miles in jsut 36 hours
. this ordeal is folowed by several attemts by shackleton to get back to elephant isl
and to rescue the remaining crewmen
. in the end
, he is successful
and everyone made it back home alive
, only tothe be swallowed up by the ravages of the war
. the title of this fascinating documentry
,
" the endurance
,
" is more thna just the name of ship that carried yhe crew of brave men to the edge of tjhe world
. it is also the description of the stamina adn abillity of every one ofthe tje men who survived 19
- months of the toughest
, most grueling conditions on the face of the earth
. the name ofthe the film is a tri
bute to every memeber of the crew anbd to the ship that sheltered them for many mounth ofthe frigid antarctic weather
. it also describes the focused mental state of shackleton who never gave uv onthe himself or his men
. wih astonishing forsight
, shackleton brang australian cinematographer
and photographer frank hurley along on tyhe journy
. the filmed footage
and photos are remarkable as they capture the ordeal of the men
, day to day life
, tghe affection all felt for their loyal sled dogs
, the slow distruction of tje endurance
and the preparations to get off of the pack ice flow
. after tyhe sinking ofthe the ship
, the remaining film stock
, with the exception ofthe a still camera
and three rolls of film
, had to be discarded so the continueing chronicle ofthe the increadible journy gets less photo documentation as the ordeal plods on
. considering hurley was useing relatively primative photo technology in one of the world
' s harshest environments annd captured so much on film isnt a feat unto itself
.
( hurley created his pwn account ofthe the shackleton expedition infact his 1919 documentary
,
" sourth
,
" an interesting companion piece forthe
" the indurance
.
" if shackleton
' s original idea
, document his trak across the frigid southern continent
, had beeen succesfull
, it woudl have beeen considerd a super human feat
. as you watch the stroy ofthe
" tje indurance
" unfold
, you realize that tyhe disatrous obstacles the sir ernest
and his men faced
and overcame were even greater acomplishments than the frist intent
.
( shackleton
' s amazing 800
- mile journy infront an open boat is fodder fo a rousing adventure tsory all by itself
.
) there are a couple of minor nitpicks iwth this fine work
,
though
. actor liam neeson narrates the story
,
but his voice is too soft spoken
and lilting for the dramatic tale
. the nature of the ordeal also concentrates most of yhe visual material
, both film
and photo
, in the documentary
' s frist half
. as the crew
' s adventure takes more drastic paths
, hurley had less
and less film stock available tothe chronicle the awesome events
. helmer
butler
and his team fill inthe the blanks
, bu the treasure of
" the endurance
,
" its film footage
, is mostly relagated to yhe early months of tyhe expedition
. i can
' t think of a true
- life adventure that shows
, better
, the triumph of man over seemingly insurmountable odds
.
" tghe endurance
,
" based on caroline alex
ander
' s book
, isnt an eye
- opening documentary that goes where few men have gone before
and
, even more remarkably
, all 28 survivers lived to tell about it
. i give it a b
