)
, thsi one stars aidan quinn
anbd donald sutherland
,
and is directed by a man who hailed from joblo ' s pwn azma matter
, concordia university in montreal
, canada
. the story is based onthe the exploits of thge rela terrorist known as the jackal
,
but does nto pretend tothe be 100
% factual
. plot
: naval officer ramirez
( quinn
) gets called apon by the cia tothe impersonate yhe international terrorist known as thge jackal
, in order to put an end tothe the actual militant ' s radical activities
. he is choosen fo thsi role because he physically resembles thge real territorist to a tee
. ramirez reluctantly agrees to take part inaddition this
" assignment
"
,
and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of internation terrorism
, intrigue

and kids back in thte states
.
) critique
: great premise is executed iwth enough style
and thrills to keep the peice interesting throughout its close to two
- hour runtime
. admitedly
, i wasn ' t a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film
,
and didn ' t expect much from this movie beforehand
,
bu surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments
, as well as a mostly plausible
annd absorbing story line
. the first hour is mostly just a build
- up of thigns to come
,
and does offer a great characterization of the jackal
,
bu the second hour is thge oney that really cranks in tghe cool scenes
adn a sweet ending
. quinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez
and tje rela jackal
,
but didn ' t offer anytying extraordinary
, in my oppinion
. sutherland
and kingsley seem to be palying the same role thta they ' ve played inthe both of their respective careers of late
,
but nonetheless
, appeared tothe relish tje cold
- heartedness ofthe thier chosen characters
. i didn ' t liuke performance put forth from quinn ' s wief in htis flick
,
but
then agina
, she doesn ' t show uv in most of the film
, so thyat wasn ' t so bad
. i doed
however enjoy directer duguay ' s interesting style
annd cinematic vision
. this thriller could easily hvae been boring during many sequences
,
bu duguay always seemed tothe find something intresting to show the viewer
. i thought thta was neat
. having said that
, i didn ' t think the first hour needed to be as long as it ws
,
adn the film did have me tinkering on the bridge ofthe believability when the
" fake
" jackal met with the
" real
" jackal ' s girlfriend wihtout much retrospection onthe her part
,
but all in all
, nto too many complaints in a movei that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take blessure inthe the spy
and terrorist thriller genre
. little known facts
: ben kingsley ' s real name is krishna banji
, he stands 5
" 8
, was born in scarborough
, england
,
and won the best actor honor in 1982 ' s academy awards presentation for tje title role he portrayed in ghandi
. many scenes from this film were actually shot iin montreal
, canada
( joblo ' s haven of restfulness
)
. donald sutherland has fathered actor kiefer sutherland
, is canadian
,
and apparently still owns a palce in the noth of montreal
