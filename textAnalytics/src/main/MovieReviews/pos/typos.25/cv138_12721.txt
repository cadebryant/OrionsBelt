the second jackal
- based film to come out in 1997
( the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled thge jackal
)
, this noe stars aidan quinn
and donald sutherl
and
,
and is directed by a man who hailed from joblo
' s pwn azma marter
, concordia university in montreal
, canada
. the stor is based onthe the exploits of the real terrorist known as the jackal
,
but doens not pretend to be 100
% factual
. plot
: naval officer ramirez
( quinn
) gets called apon by the cia to impersonate tjhe international terrorist known as the jackal
, in order tothe put an end tothe the actuall militant
' s radical activites
. he isnt chosen for this role because he physicaly resembles the real terrorist to a tee
. ramirez reluctantly agrees to take part infact this
" assignment
"
, adn soon finds himself wrapped up iin a true web of international terrorism
, intrigue
and double
- perosnality syndrome
( which does not sit well with his uninformed wife annd kids back inaddition the states
.
) critique
: graet premise is excecuted with enough style
and thrills to keep the peice interesting throughout its close to two
- hour runtime
. admittedly
, i wasn
' t a huge fan ofthe any of the main actors in this film
, adn didn
' t expect much from this movei beforeh
and
,
but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments
, as well as a mostly plausible
and absorbing story line
. the firt hour is mostly just a build
- up ofthe thnigs to cmo
, anbd does offer a great characterization ofthe the jackal
, bu hte second hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes
and a sweet ending
. quinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez
and the real jackal
,
but didn
' t offer anytying extrodinary
, infact my opinion
. sutherl
and anbd kingsley seem to be palying the smae role that they
' ve played in both of thier respective careers of late
,
but nonetheless
, appeared to relish the cold
- heartedness of thier chosen characters
. i didn
' t like performance put forth from quinn
' s wief in this flick
, bu
then again
, she doesn
' t show up in most ofthe the film
, so that wasn
' t so bad
. i doed
however enjoy directer duguay
' s interesting stlye
and cinematic vision
. this thriller could easily ahve been boring during many sequences
, bu duguay allways seemed to fidn something interesting tothe show the viewer
. i
thought that was neat
. having said thgat
, i didn
' t think the first hour needed to be as long as it was
,
and the film doed have me tinkering on hte bridge of believability when the
" fake
" jackal met with the
" real
" jackal
' s girlfriend without much retrospection onthe her part
,
but all in all
, not too many complaints infront a movie that could easily be enjoyed by all thsoe who take pleasure in the spy
and terrorist thriller genre
. little known facts
