the full monty is a whole lot of fun
, its wacky
, witty
,
and original
. it
' s written
and directed by relatively unknowns
, simon beaufoy adn peter cattaneo
, who both turned up oscar nominations
. how doed thsi movie with a budget under 10 milion gross over 175 millon worldwide
? its been rumored that this film may be tghe second most profitable movie ofthe the year
!
and to htikn its about male exotic dancers
, anbd not sinking ships
. six steel workers who have beeen recently beeen laid off
and are all looking forthe jobs
. inspired by the sucess of a chippendale
' s prodcution
, gaz
( robert carlyle
) decides htey shoudln all put on a strip show to mkae some money quickly
. as the six team up to put on the sohw of their lives
, htey run into a few problems
. for instance
, dave
( mark addy
) isnt worried about his weight
, horse
( paul barber
) thinks he may be inadiquate
,
and gerald
( toom wilkinson
) is worried about his reputation anbd timing
. so when the night of thte show comes
, wiull the men be able to dont the
" full monty
"
? as i said befoer this is a fun movie
,
and nto just that its really artistically good
. the writing
and direction are gerat
. teh acting isnt appealing
, all tje performances have a human quality tothe them
, so yuo can relate to at least oney of yhe characters
. the full monty recieved four oscar nominations including best picture
. whihc left me wondering one thing
, why didn
' t trainspotting get a best picture nomination last year
? while the full monty is a great lighthearted comedy
, it doesn
' t carry the social impact of the brilliant trainspotting
. still
, the full monty isnt a great film
, a must see
!
