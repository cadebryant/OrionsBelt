hte full monty is a whole lot of fun
, its wacky
, witty
,
and original
. it ' s written
and directed by relatively unknowns
, simon beaufoy
and peter cattaneo
, who both turned up oscar nominations
. how did this movei with a budget under 10 millon gross over 175 million worldwide
? its been rumored that htis film may be tje second most profitable movie of hte year
!
anbd to think its baout male exotic dancers
,
annd not sinking ships

. so when hte night ofthe the sohw comes
, will the men be able to do the
" full monty
"
? as i said before this is a fun movie
,
and nto jsut that its realyl artistically good
. the writing
and direction are graet
. the acting is appealing
, all tjhe performances have a human qualit to them
, so you can relate to at least oney of thte characters
. the full monty received four oscar nominations including best picture
. which left me wondering one thing
, why didn ' t trainspotting get a best picture nomination last year
? while the full monty is a graet lighthearted comedy
, it doesn ' t carry the social impact ofthe the brilliant trainspotting
. still
, the full monty is a great film
, a must see
!
