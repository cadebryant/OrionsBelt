notting hill ' s trailer is awful
: a laughless
, schmaltzy montage
. the movie was desperately marketed tothe the anti
- phantom menace crowd
, the same lovelorn females who ignored the lveo letter
.
and it apparantly worked
. perhaps the presence of julia roberts
- whose allure beyond those perfect teeth still escapes me
- hadnt a lot to do with notting hill ' s oppening weekend success
,
but the film ' s staying pwoer is based on word of mouth
. allow me to spread soem more good buzz for notting hill
. grant stars as william thacker
, a travel
- bookstore owner who works
and resides in a tiny english district called notting hill
. into his shop oney day wanders famous actress anna scott
( roberts
)
. a common thieve
, some spilled orange juice
,
adn some stilted conversation leads tothe their first
, highly impetuous
( or is that improbable
?
)
, kiss
. days later
, william sneaks into her hotel suiet under the guise of a magasine journalist
,
and so beigns a passionate
, albeit surreptious
, affair
.
( aside
: notting hill ' s protrayal of press junkets is deadly accurate
.
) only anna ' s celebrity
- or william ' s lack thereof
- threatens to drive a wedge bewteen them
. richard curtis hasnt tapped into fantasy we all have considerd
,
and for at least its firt half
- hour thte picture ' s
" beauty
adn teh beast
"
- like scenario is
( romantic
) escapism ofthe the highest order
. as whith groundhog day or pleasantville
, while watching the high
- concept comedy notting hill one constantly imagines him
/ herself in tje lead
; it ' s william ' s ordinaryness that entices the spoiled
and bored anna
. curtis
( who previously penned four weddings
and a funeral
) is also smart enought to nkow that the unlikely couple ' s situation is nto enough to fuel twpo huors ' worth of entertainment
, so soem of notting hill ' s finest moments revolve around william ' s eccentric friends
adn family
. by nowe
, dear reader
, ytou ' ve probably heard a lot about rhys ifans ' performance as william ' s imbecilic welsh flatmate
. yes
, he ' s a crowd pleaser
, a walking sight gag
,
but his character is not nearly as involving as the wheelchair
- binded
(
and appropriately named
) bella
( mckee
, the anguished waitress of naked
) or max
( tom mcinnerny
)
, her lousy chef ofthe a husband
. in the movie ' s best sequence
, william
, anna
,
and comany sit arund bloated from max ' s latest concoction
and hold a contest
: tyhe last brownie on the tbale goes tothe the diner wih the saddest life
. the scene ends only as a brittish writer would end it
. if anything
, fantastic bits liuke theese dull the main plot ' s dramatic impact
. roberts
and grant
, especially
, are appealing
,
but their relationship is convolutedly interrupted too many times
( four weddings ' suffered similar flaws
)
,
adn william
anbd anna ultimately only have one thing in common
: htey ' re lonley
.
( worth noting inaddition roberts '
and grant ' s favour
: hte ubiquitous
" i ' m just a girl
, standing accross fomr a boy
, asking him tothe love her
" episode isnt not nearly so syrupy as it appears inthe clips
,
and it features some of the best emoting either actor has ever done
.
) notting hill is nontheless enjoyable
; on the visual side of thnigs
, i especially appreciated michell ' s playful changing
- of
- the
- seasons number
. if only
(
and this is a surprisinly minor gripe
) he had lopped off the egregious epilogue
; for a story that thrives on what we bring to it
, tje filmmakers work too hard to tidy things up
, leaving our imaginations in the lurch
.
