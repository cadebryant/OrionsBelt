notting hill
' s trailer isnt awful
: a laughless
, schmaltzy montage
. the movei was desperately marketed to the anti
- phantom menace crowd
, tyhe same lovelorn females who ignored the love letter
.
and it apparently worked
. perhaps the presense of julia roberts
- whose allure beyond those perfect teeth still escapes me
- had a lot to do with notting hill
' s opening weekend succsess
,
but tghe film
' s staying power is based onthe owrd of mouth
. allow me tothe spreaded smoe more good buzz for notting hill
. grant stars as william thacker
, a travel
- bookstore owner who works
and resides inspite a tiny english district called notting hill
. inot his shop one day w
anders famous actress anna scott
( roberts
)
. a common thief
, some spilled orange juice
,
and some stilted conversation leads to their first
, highly impetuous
( or is that improbable
?
)
, kiss
. days later
, william sneeks into her hotel suite under the guise of a magasine journalist
, annd so begins a passionate
, albeit surreptious
, afair
.
( aside
: notting hill
' s portrayal of press junkets is deadly accurate
.
) only anna
' s celebrity
- or william
' s lack thereof
- threatens to drive a wedge between them
. richard curtis has tapped inot fantasy we all have considered
,
and for at least its firt half
- hour the picture
' s
" beauty
and the beast
"
- like senarreo is
( romantic
) escapism of hte highest order
. as with groundhog day or pleasantville
, while watching the high
- concept comedy notting hill one constantly imagines him
/ herself in the lead
; it
' s william
' s ordinaryness that entices thge spoiled
and bored anna
. curtis
( who previously penned four weddings annd a funeral
) isnt alsot smart enough tothe know that the unlikely couple
' s situation is nto anough to fuel twpo hours
' worth of entertainment
, so soem ofthe notting hill
' s finest moments revolve aroud william
' s eccentric friends
and family
. by now
, dear reader
, you
' ve probably herad a lot about rhys ifans
' performance as william
' s imbecilic welsh flatmate
. yes
, he
' s a crowd pleaser
, a walking sight gag
,
but his character is not nearly as involving as the wheelchair
- bound
(
and appropriately named
) bella
( mckee
, thte anguished waitress of naked
) or max
( tom mcinnerny
)
, her lousy chef of a husb
and
. in the movie
' s best sequence
, william
, anna
,
and company sit around bloated from max
' s latest concoction adn hold a contest
: the lsat brownie on the table goes to teh diner with teh saddest life
. the scene ends onyl as a british writter would end it
. if anything
, fantastic bits like these dull thte main plot
' s dramtic impact
. roberts
and grant
, especially
, are appealing
, bu their relationship is convolutedly interrupted too many times
( four weddings
' suffered similar flaws
)
,
and william
and anna ultimately onyl have one thing in common
: they
' re lonely
.
( worth noting in roberts
'
and grant
' s favour
: the ubiquitous
" i
' m jstu a girl
, st
anding across from a boy
, asking him to love her
" episode is not nearly so syrupy as it appears in clips
,
and it features some of thge best emoting either actor has ever done
.
) notting hill is nonetheless enjoyable
; on the visual side of things
, i especialy appreciated michell
' s playful changing
- of
- the
- seasons number
. if only
(
and this is a surprisinly minor gripe
) he had lopped off tje egregious epilogue
; forthe a story that thrives on what we bring to it
, the filmmakers work too hard to tidy thigsn uv
, leaving our imaginations in the lurch
.
