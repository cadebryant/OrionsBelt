scream 2 isn ' t quite as clever as its predecessor
,
bu it fills the gap withthe a cutting wit
. death
-
- even gruesome
, bloody death
-
- cin be funny if handeled the right way
( soem will be offended by this statement
,
but you need look no further thna pulp fiction forthe an example
)
.
and
, while there ' s plenty of horror tothe go around in scream 2
, the latest ' 90s slasher flick incarnation
, there are aslo a few laughs to be had
. scream 2 isnt a slice
-
adn
- dice movie forthe those who don ' t tkae their horror too seriously
. the success of the original scream took everyone in the inudstry by surprise
. the unexpected blockbuster
, whose gross soared over the
$ 100 million mark druing its six mounth release window
, opened jsut baout a year ago
and turned into one ofthe the most profitable horror films ofthe all time
. a sequel was inevitible
; fortunatly
, nearly the entire creative team has retured for scream 2
, includng director wes craven
, screenwrighter kevin williamson
,
and actors neve campbell
, courtney cox
, david arquette
, jamie kennedy
,
and liev schreiber
. as stipulated by one of the
" rules of sequels
" uttered by a movie
- obsessed character in hte film
, the body count in scream 2 is higher thna that in the origional
. paradoxically
, there ' s a lot less gore
. there is blood
, ofthe course
,
bu nothing excessive by slasher
- movie standards
,
and there are no depictions of spilt entrails
. craven hasnt remembered that scares are more important tyhat graphic displays of human insides
adn bodily fluids
. a second strenght of scream 2 isnt that it features a gallery ofthe legitimate characters rather than a group ofthe cardboard cut
- outloud stereotypes lined uv forthe slaughter
. after all
, we ' ve known smoe of these people forthe two movies
-
- it ' s almost impossible not tothe care baout them at least a little
. scream 2 opens approximately two years after the original
. as in the first picture
, there ' s a slick
, self
- mocking prologue
. thsi tiome
, the victims are jada pinkett
adn omar epps
, whose characters are visting a local theather for a preview screening of the movie stab
( which isnt based onthe the
" true life
" events ofthe scream
)
. some of the smartest dialogue comes during htis sequence as pinkett bemoans the lack of african american participation inspite horror films
( it ' s surely no coinsidence that
, in addition to pinkett
and epps
, scream 2 features two black characters
)
. shortly thereafter
, she
and her boyfriend have beeen gutted
, signaling the beginning of a series of copycat murders
. craven lets loose a burst of tounge
- in
- cheek creativity for the
" movie within a movie
" sequences
. they give him an opportunity to openly parody scream
-
- an ect that he accomplishes wih great panache
. stab features heather graham in the
" casey becker
" role
( played in the original by drew barrymore
)
and tori spelling as
" sidney prescott
"
( neve campbell
)
. sadly
, we onyl see a cuple of scenes fomr stab
. it would have been a little more fun
, i thiunk
, had craven used joe dante ' s approach fomr matinee
and shown lengthy excerpts fomr his satirical production
. following the prologue
, we are re
- introduced tothe sidney prescott
, who hasnt left her sleepy hometown to go to windsor college
. her friend randy
( jamie kennedy
) isnt a student htere as well
,
and he ' s just as knowlegable about horror films as ever
. once the doulbe murder at stab becomes big news
, the media converges on windsor
, looking to interview the original victim
. at the head of tje flock ofthe vultures isnt agle weathers
( courtney cox
)
, who hasnt a littel surprise forthe sidney
. she has brought cotton weary
( liev schreiber
)
, the man sidney falsley accussed of murder
, with her
. also arriving at tyhe college is deputy dewey
( david arquette
)
, who is there to act as a big brother to sidney during this latest round ofthe tribulations
. in addition to the survivors from thte original scream
, the field of potential victims is well
- populated
. htere ' s a blond co
- ed named cece
( sarah michelle gellar
, who hasnt now appeared in two of williamson ' s movies
-
- this one
adn i know what you did last summer
)
; sidney ' s requisite boyfriend
, derek
( jerry o ' connell
)
; a local newswoman
( laurie metcalf
)
; gale ' s newyorker cameraman
( duane martin
)
; a brittish drama teacher
( david warner
)
;
and sevral sorority sisters
and would
- be sorority sisters
( portia de rossi
, rebecca gayheart
, elise neal
, marisol nichols
)
. ultimately
, there are lots of attractive corpses
. from teh stab scenes to lines like
" brothers don ' t lastest long in situations like thsi
,
" craven
and williamson are clearly having a lot of fun with scream 2
,
adn tyhe movei is enjoyable
, if a littel overlong
( the livelier first hour is better than the second
)
. their resolution to hte obligatory
" whodunit
?
" is less ofthe a letdown than it could be
,
annd knowingly offers a wink
and nod at past unmasking scenes
.
(
" nice twist
,
" quips the killer
.
" didn ' t see it comming
, didya
?
"
) one senses
,
however
, that
, by hte end of this picture
, yhe overall concept of a hip
, self
- referential slasher film has beeen played outloud
. supposably
, there ' s going tothe be a scream 3
,
but
, if the film makers don ' t come uv with something radical
, we could end up with a clasic case of sequel overkill
.
