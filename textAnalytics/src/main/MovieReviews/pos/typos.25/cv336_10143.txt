scream 2 isn
' t qtuie as clever as its predecessor
, bu it fills the gap with a cutting wit
. death
-
- even gruesome
, bloody death
-
- cin be funny if h
andled the right way
( soem will be offended by htis statement
,
but you need look noone further than pulp fiction for an example
)
.
and
, while there
' s plenty of horror to go around in scream 2
, the latest
' 90s slasher flick incarnation
, ther are allso a few laughs to be had
. scream 2 is a slice
-
and
- dice movie for those who don
' t take their horror too seriously
. the success of the original scream took everyone in the industry by surprize
. thge unexpected blockbuster
, whose gross soared over the
$ 100 million mark during its six mounth release window
, oppened just baout a yera ago
and turned inot oen ofthe the most profitable horror films of all time
. a sequel wass inevitable
; fortunately
, nearly the entire creative team has returned for scream 2
, including director wes craven
, screenwriter kevin williamson
,
and actors neve campbell
, courtney cox
, david arquette
, jamie kennedy
,
and liev schreiber
. as stipulated by one of the
" rules of sequels
" uttered by a movie
- obssessed character in tje film
, the body count infact scream 2 isnt higher than tht in the original
. paradoxically
, htere
' s a lot less gore
. ther isnt blood
, ofthe course
,
but nothing eccessive by slasher
- movie st
andards
,
and htere are no depictions of spilled entrails
. craven hasnt remembered that scares are more important thast graphic displays of human insides anbd bodily fluids
. a second strength of scream 2 is tht it features a gallery of legitimate characters rather than a group of cardboard cut
- out stereotypes lined uv for slaughter
. after all
, we
' ve known some of these people forthe two movies
-
- it
' s almost impossible not to care about them at least a little
. scream 2 opens approximately twpo yeasr after hte original
. as in the firt picture
, there
' s a slick
, self
- mocking prologue
. this time
, yhe victims are jada pinkett
and omar epps
, whose characters are visiting a local theater forthe a preview screening of the movie stab
( wich is based on the
" true life
" events of scream
)
. some of the smartest dialogue comes during this sequence as pinkett bemoans the lack of african american participation in horror films
( it
' s surely noone coincidence that
, inaddition addition to pinkett
and epps
, scream 2 features two balck characters
)
. shortly thereafter
, she
and her boyfriend have been gutted
, signaling the beginning of a serieses of copycat murders
. craven lets loose a burst ofthe tongue
- in
- cheek creativity for hte
" movie within a movei
" sequences
. they give him an opportunity tothe openly parody scream
-
- an ect that he accomplishes with great panache
. stab features heather graham in the
" casey becker
" role
( played in tyhe original by drew barrymore
) adn tori spelling as
" sidney prescott
"
( neve campbell
)
. sadly
, we only see a cuple of scenes from stab
. it would have beeen a little omre fun
, i tihkn
, had craven used joe dante
' s approach fomr matinee
and shown lengthy excerpts ffrom his satirical prodcution
. following teh prologue
, we are re
- introduced to sidney prescott
, who has left her sleepy hometown to go tothe windsor coleeg
. her friend r
andy
( jamie kennedy
) is a student there as well
,
and he
' s jsut as knowlegable baout horror films as ever
. once the double murder at stab becomes big news
, the media converges on windsor
, looking to interview the orginal victum
. at tje head of the flock ofthe vultures is agle weathers
( courtney cox
)
, who has a little suprize for sidney
. she has brought cotton weary
( liev schreiber
)
, the man sidney falsely acccused of murder
, with her
. also arriving at the college is deputy dewey
( david arquette
)
, who is there to act as a big brother to sidney during this latest round of tribulations
. inthe addition tothe tghe survivers fomr the originnal scream
, the field of potential victims is well
- populated
. htere
' s a blond co
- ed named cece
( sarah michelle gellar
, who has nowe appeared in two of williamson
' s movies
-
- thsi one
and i know what you did last summer
)
; sidney
' s requisite boyfriend
, derek
( jerry o
' connell
)
; a local newswoman
( laurie metcalf
)
; gale
' s new cameraman
( duane martin
)
; a british drama teacher
( david warner
)
;
and sevral sorority sisters annd would
- be sorority sisters
( portia de rossi
, rebecca gayheart
, elise neal
, marisol nichols
)
. ultimately
, there are lots ofthe attractive corpses
. from thte stab scenes to lines like
" brothers don
' t last long inaddition situations like this
,
" craven
and williamson are clearly hvaing a lot ofthe fun with scream 2
,
and the movie isnt enjoyable
, if a little overlong
( thte livelier first hour is better than the second
)
. their resolution to the obligatory
" whodunit
?
" is less of a letdown than it coudl be
,
and knowingly offers a wink
and nod at past unmasking scenes
.
(
" nice twist
,
" quips the killer
.
" didn
' t see it coming
, didya
?
"
) one senses
,
however
, that
, by the end of this picture
, the overall concept of a hip
, self
- referential slasher film hasnt been played out
. supposably
, there
' s going to be a scream 3
, bu
, if the film makers don
' t cmo up with something radical
, we could end uv with a classic case of sequel overkill
.
