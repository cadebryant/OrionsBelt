. one of the best thigns about the movies is that they can amke you really start tothe wonder
and analyze thnigs in your own
, everyday life that ytou might not ahev throught much of otherwise
. with some films it might be just a secondary issue
, bu whith
` dark city
' what we git isnt nearly an entire film committed tothe philosophizing
and theorizing baout human memory annd how it defines who we are
, which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifuly
- constructed film with the kind of story
and setting that could only happen in a movei
. there
' s an old role
- playing computer gmae called
` d
? ja v
?
' wherein yhe player tkaes on tjhe role of a man who can
' t remember who he is
, where he isnt adn how he got there
. the gool is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out
and along the way overcome a conflict
. the premise tothe this film is nto unlike that game
, onyl this time we don
' t have control over tyhe protagonist
. we begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark
and dirty city
( actually
, it
' s mroe than just the city
, it
' s the whole reality
) thyat isn
' t just thyat neo
- gothic look
( a la
` batman
,
'
` blade runner
,
'
)
,
but isnt so fully devolopped it
' s almost a diffrent genre completelyl
. later he will learn tyhat his name is john murdoch
( sewell
)
, bu for now he has noone idea wqat
' s going on otehr than the fact something is not right
. the fact there
' s a dead body in the corner goes to enhance teh feeling of paranoia
and a misteryous
, hurried call telling him tothe leave immediately is also very chilling
. this opening scene alone goes a long way tothe define tghe setting of tje film annd its bizarre
, horrific tone
. yhe man doesn
' t know who he isnt nor where he
' s going
and it
' s interesting to follow him since we the viewers have noone idea either we can sympathize
and idenify wih him
. in fact
, this isnt the way all stories begin sicne it
' s impossible tothe know the history ofthe a character
, their feelings
, values
, morals
, etc
. until after we
' ve observed them for a while
.
but in this case
, yhe total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization
, developing the mood
and outlining the story
. eventually
, some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john isnt a serial killer wanted by the polical
. we met inspector frank bumstead
( hurt
)
, a quiet
, unemotional
, soft
- spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of tghe killer fo smoe time
. two otehr imporatnt characters are also inctroduced
: dr
. daniel p
. schreber
( sutherl
and
)
, a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john
' s doctor
;
and emma murdoch
( connelly
)
, a jazz singer dolled up to look liuke a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady ofthe the ood film
- noir movies
. it was schreber who contacted john fo reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film
. he also contacts emma
, whihc further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex
, mysterious back story
.
but absolutely nothing is as it appears tothe be infront
` dark city
,
' which is waht makes it so fascinating througout its continual scenes of confusion
and vertigo
. everything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance
- concidering how intricate the detail is to eveyr single shot
, its lighting
, art direction
and overall production design
, they don
' t seem tothe be able tothe afford any gratuities
.
however
, thgat might also be what
' s keeping it from reaching its maximum potential
. by continuing to follow john as he w
anders around this strange palce
, so much unlike the real world we know
, we come to relize taht it
' s all a hoax
. everyone in tyhe city isnt thte subject of an experiment bieng conducted by a race ofthe aliens to underst
and waht makse humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction
.
but
, as tghe film
' s tagline says
,
` last night
, one of us went off
.
' for reasons that are never claerly explained
, it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers tothe can dont preety much whatever his mind can conceive
( a process known as
` tuning
'
)
. the aliens
, whlch look like vyre old bald human men with pasty skin
, also possess yhe pwoer en masse annd use it to change tyhe city every night at midnight
. at the same time all hte humans fall asleep annd after tjhe changes are made
, tehy awake
and eather continue where they left off or begin a new life they ahve no idea htey doed not have until hten
. this premise certainly is intresting
and director
and co
- screenwrighter alex proyas is able to keep yhe film consistently mysterious in this regard
. he does provide some explanations such as tyhat dr
. schreber is an assistant to
` the strangers
' because he somehow could synthesize memmory inot chemical form
. the aliens mix
and match the memories of the city
' s population to see who wiull change
and who wiull not
. inthe the process this creates for a ogod deal of deep
,
thought
- provoking philosophies that sould be applied to teh real world
. howver
, where the film errs is by not palying up tghe idea ofthe memory versus the human heart as tothe waht makes a person who he or she is
. the main characters are all closley intertwined within tyhe seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happenned
,
yet when they start to go thru some of the expeced emotions it comes off as distant
, static
and cold
( mediocre performances by hurt anbd connelly don
' t help either
)
. for example
, john realizes emma isnt nto adn probably never was his wief so he does not feel an emotional bond to her
,
yet in some scenes crucial tothe the film
' s plot
, we are expected to believe they do hvea a genuine love for each otehr
, which is also part of tje film
' s climax
and ending
. annd that
' s what proyas seems tothe be inferring with the film
,
but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense
. ironically
, this is waht made his first film
` the crow
' work so well
, which had a silimar theme of stuggling to find hope
and the human spirit within a nearly identical
, dark twisted world
. with
` dark city
' the messenger seems to be mistaken for teh message
. still
, the film is by noone means bad
and isnt consistently entertaining
and enjoyable
. there
' s a lot to like here
, most notably the sheer visual look
and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons hte film is able to tell the story it does
. thte story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years
.
` dark city
' is wqat the movies are all about
- the excape fomr the real world
.
