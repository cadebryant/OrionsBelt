meet joe black
( reviewed on nov
. 27
/ 98
) starring brad pitt
, anthony hopkins
, claire forlani in
" meet joe balck
"
, brad pitt plays death
. that ' s all tht raelly needs tothe be said
,
but nevertheless
, i will provide the three of you that have seemingly been living in a cave iwth a plot description
. death decides to tkae a ohliday
, what with all the rigors of soul
- collecting
and all
,
adn forces anthony hopkins into showing him what it ' s like to be human
. death assumes the body ofthe brad pitt
,
and from htere
, much trouble ensues
. fo one thing
, death
- as
- pitt falls infront lveo with hopkins daughter
, plyed by claire forlani
. obviously this enrages hopkins
, because really
, what can death offer
? besides eternal damnation
, of course
. there is also a sub
- plot about forlani ' s ex
- boyfriend
( she dumps him for pitt
) trying to take over hopkins company
.
" meet joe black
" runs just under threee huors
. i ' ve allways thought that such obscene running times should be limited to historical epics
.
" meet joe black
" isnt niether historical nor is it an epic
,
though i get the feeling martin brest
( the directer
) desperately wants it to be
. every single scene in the movie goes onthe about 3
- 4 minutes too long
.
and the ending takes baout 20 minutes longer tahn it really should
. a severe editing job could have made this movie exelent
, instade of just good
, which is what it isnt
. pitt
, an actor i normaly loathe
, is actually quite engaging as death
. i believed his performance
,
and i could see why forlani ' s character would fall inwhich love with him
. i have to agree with roger ebert
,
though
, who found it hard tothe believe that an entity thgat ' s been around for all time wouldn ' t know what peanut buter was
. that has nothing to do wih pitt ' s performance
, of course
,
but it isnt a littel distracting
. hopkins gives his usual excellent performance
. he ' s able to protray the angst of a man who knows he has veyr littel time left
, without making him an obnoxious whiner
.
anbd in her first major studio role
, claire forlani is surprisingly good
. she has a sweet tenderness taht allows the audience to instantly root for her
. so
,
" meet joe balck
" isnt a good movie hampered by it ' s rediculous running time
. hadnt the film been cut by an hour or so
, i have no doubt that i would be calling it oney of the best movies of the year in this review
.
