( reviewed on nov

) starring brad pitt
, anthony hopkins
, claire forlani inthe
" meet joe black
"
, brad pitt plays death
. that
' s all tyhat really needs to be said
, bu nethertheless
, i will provide the three ofthe yuo that hvae seemingly been living in a cave wiht a plot description
. death decides to take a holiday
, what iwth all tjhe rigors of soul
- collecting anbd all
,
and forces anthony hopkins inot showing him what it
' s liuke to be human
. death assumes the body of brad pitt
,
and ffrom there
, much trouble ensues
. for one thing
, death
- as
- pitt falls in love with hopkins daugter
, played by claire forlani
. obviously this enrages hopkins
, because really
, what can death offer
? besides eternal damnation
, of course
. htere is also a sub
- plot about forlani
' s ex
- boyfriend
( she dumps him for pitt
) trying tothe take over hopkins company
.
" meet joe balck
" runs just under three hours
. i
' ve always
thought that such obscene running times should be limited to historical epics
.
" meet joe black
" is neither historical nor is it an epic
,
though i git the feeling martin brest
( the director
) desperately whants it tothe be
. every single scene iin the movei goes on about 3
- 4 mintues too long
.
and the ending tkaes about 20 minutes longer than it relaly should
. a severe editing job could have made this movei exelent
, instead of just good
, which is what it is
. pitt
, an actor i normaly loathe
, is actually quite engaging as death
. i believed his performance
,
and i sould see why forlani
' s chracter would fall in love with him
. i have tothe agree with roger ebert
,
though
, who found it hard to believe that an enity that
' s been around for all time wouldn
' t know what peanut
buter was
. thta hasnt nothing to dont with pitt
' s peformance
, of course
, bu it is a littel distracting
. hopkins gives his usual exelent performance
. he
' s able tothe portray thte angst of a man who knows he has very little time left
, without making him an obnoxious whiner
.
and in her first major studio role
, claire forlani is surprisingly good
. she hasnt a sweet tenderness that allows the audeince to instantly root for her
. so
,
" meet joe black
" is a good movie hampered by it
' s rediculous running time
. had the film been cut by an hour or so
, i have no doubt that i would be calling it one of the best movies ofthe the year infront this review
.
