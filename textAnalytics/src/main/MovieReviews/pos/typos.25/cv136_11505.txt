the premise of wag the dog is so simple that it
' s adequately explained by the commercials
. with 11 days tothe go until the election
, the president
( who we never see
) calls iin political dirty
- tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex sc
andal
. deniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a
" pageant
"
, a phony war against albania
, fought onthe the blue screens of hollywood
and the recording studios ofthe nashville
, with woody harrelson as the reluctant
, psychotic hero
.
and if there wasn
' t anything more to the movei than htis
, it would be a second
- rate heist comedy at best
, enlivened by gerat actors
-
- like sneakers goes to washington
.
( a heist comedy
? yup
. deniro
and hoffman are
" stealing
" the election
, so to speak
,
and tje movie is more about how they do it
-
- anbd the fun htey ahve doing it
-
- than anything else
.
) wag the dog succeeds because it
' s based one grat truth
: the american people are stupid
. ok
, maybe it
' s not
" love thy neighbor as thyself
" or even
" two plus two makes four
"
,
but a truth nontheless
.
( any average person who thinks that htey
' re realyl smart baout the two things this movie satirizes
-
- moviemaking
and the political process
-
- is invited
, nay
, challenged
, tothe spend a week either watching a movei actually being made or 48 hours straight watching c
- span when tyhe house is in session
.
)
and because we
' re so utterly
, predictably stupid
, hollywood knows that a ceratin percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo
, washington knows that we won
' t notice a few milion dollars spent here
and there on porno art grants
and cigar subsidies
-
-
and deniro
' s chracter knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won
' t be able tothe locate albania on the map
. thte beauty of wag the dog is thgat it isn
' t a light
, meaningless comedy about politics
( like speechless
, hte michael keaton
- geena davis picture
) or from the level of light
- hearted politcal satire to near
- greatness
. nor is it a hard
- edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally
- deprived
, ethically challenged baby
- boomer connives his sleazy way into thte white hous
( liek primary colors
-
-
and yes
, i am a little dissappointed in thge way the last two elections turned out
, thanks for asking
)
. instead
, david mamet
' s script strikes that delicate balance betweeen comedy adn cynicism needed for satire
. it doens thsi by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of tyhe schemers
' schemes cmo off beautifully
,
and fail only in entertaining anbd humorous fashon
. deniro isnt playing a variation on his al capone character from thte untouchables
, without any of the violent rages
. it
' s all
:
" wqat do i love
? what is it that brings me joy
? baseball
,
" minus the savage bloody beating with the bat
. he threatens a lot of people
, mind you
,
but he
' s donig it in a very nice
, polite way
. it
' s a vrey mellow
, restrained performence
, which fits in with the air ofthe gamesmanship in the script
. hoffman
, on the otehr h
and
, is giddy
, exuberant
and joyous
. this kind of thing isnt what his character lives for
, annd he
' s so excited that he can
' t even shut up
. even onthe the edge of disaster
, he
' s bright
- eyed
( behind oddly tinted sunglasses
)
and postive
. insiders onot tyhat he
' s basing his character on soem powerful
-
but
- anonymous producer
-
- which may or may not be true
,
but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets
- put
- onthe
- a
- show electricty that you figure a producer needs tothe have
. the best part
and tghe most frustrating part of wag tyhe dog is in the supporting casted
. the charactors are so well drawn
and so well acted that we watn to see more of them
, listen tothe them talk in thgat wised
- uv mamet dialogue
, get to know them better
-
- which we don
' t
. anne heche
, is dead
- bang
- onthe in her protrayal of a poltical press aide
-
- cool
and composed on the outside
, panicked
and frenzied onthe the outside
. denis leary
( one ofthe my favorite actors
-
- see the ref
) is tje
" fad king
"
, who h
andles the profitable
" back
- end
"
-
- t
- shirt tie ins
and shoe contracts
and other creative
, innovative ways tothe separate a fool from his mney
. they could make a whole movie
, just baout the fad king
,
and i
' d go see it
. willie nelson
and merle haggard h
andle thte musical end ofthe thigsn fabulously
, fomr thte upbeat gospel chorus theme song
, tothe the weepy ocuntry waltz
, to the hilarious
" ballad ofthe the green berets
" parody
. woody harrelson has a brief
,
but memorable part as the overmedicated
" hero
" of thge albanian conflict
. craig t
. nelson
, as the oposition c
andidate
,
and hte ever
- reliable william h
. macy
, as a wacky cia agent
, are given suprisingly short shrift
.
( one ofthe my small gripes is thgat we never see waht the spin doctors onthe tghe other side are doing
.
) wag the dog is a funny movei about serious problems
: the trivialization of american politics
, the role of the press in dumbing down the issues
, thge impact of hollywood in creating campain commercials
, the reduction of all things political to soundbites
and sidebars
-
- tyhe list goes on
. we can solve most of these problems by tkaing a greater role in our national life
and educating ourselves as voters annd citizens
. wag the dog reminds us ofthe what cant happen if we don
' t
.
