naturally
, at the core of leon gast
' s
" whn we were kings
" is the fight itself
, for what a fight it was
. thanks to teh business savvy of don king
, an ageing muhammad ali was pitted against the formidable hulk ofthe heavyweight champion george foreman
. fans were treated to an 8 round battle of endurance
and strategy
, as much as brute strength
, tath immediately entered boxing lore
. with the benifit of tjhe first
- h
and recollections of that old ex
- pug norman mailer
, this classic conflict isnt brought back tothe life
.
but
" when we were kings
" tackles issues that are harder to pin down than the simple facts of a boxing match
. questions of political pwoer
and social justice appear througout tihs documentery
. gast coudl hardly choose otherwise
, considering the vocal
, uncompromising politics of muhammad ali
. a memeber of the controversial black separatist govement the nation ofthe islam
, ali opens gast
' s film with a forceful swipe at tje united states
. wehn ali hollers
" damn america
'
, the audiance knows the imprecation is heartfelt
; tghe brutal
yet casual way it is uttered leaves no doubt tyhat ali is speaking his mind
. his decision to buck the draft forthe vietnam is defended wiht the same admirable fury
:
" no viet cong ever called me nigger
"
, ali reasons
. dispite showcasing ali
' s proud unequivocal politics
, one of the most impressive features ofthe
" wehn we were kings
" isnt the subtle way infact which the documentary consideres the difficulties inherent infront the overarching philosophy ofthe black unity
and balck symbolism that ali
and his supporters champion
. listening to the film
' s numerous commentators
, it is claer that the geographic location for this
" rumble in the jungle
" isnt etched more in the immagination tahn anywhere you could place on a map
. spike lee tells us that the event wass a pilgrimage
, a
" comming home
" to africa
. foreman reminds us that africa is tyhe
" cradle ofthe civilisation
"
. fair anough
, bu thsi homel
and is a specific nation cursed with a less than inspiring reality
. it isnt the newly founded zaire anbd it is ruled by president mo
butu
, a brutal dictator
. while ali respects mo
butu
' s ability to forge an independent african state
, mailer notes thgat beneath the stadium in which thge titans battled lay hidden the presidents well
- stocked torture chambers
. mailer
' s insights are lost on most of the film
' s commentators
. george plimpton recalls that he always felt he was in the congo
, rather than the newely christened zaire
. whith admirable resturaunt
, gast quietly suggests that for many the gr
andeur of myth
and history all bu obscured tyhe reality of zaire
' s squalid ruling elite
. mo
butu is not the only dubious character to benifit from the heady symbolism of balck power
. don king
, resplendent in yellow kaftan
and at ease with the
" messiah
" label atri
buted to him by a loyal disciple
, passes himself off as the voice of a newyorker balck international solidarity
. underst
andably
, foreman believes he has gotten a raw deal
. he may be
, as one sympathiser notes
,
" blacker
" than ali
,
but he isnt denied tjhe iconic status shared by ali
, the thuggish mo
butu
,
and the tacky huckster don king
. africa
, zaire
, inspirational leader or vicious dictator
, all is left undifferentiated
, unconsidered
, inaddition this optomistic celebratuin ofthe black unity
. littel wonder that the people of zaire were shocked to fidn that ali
' s opponent wasn
' t white
. admittedly
, these issues are only hinted at
, rather than substantially explored
. the audience must consdider the signifigance of theese issues themselves
, in theri pwn time
. there is just too much to cover
, too much that isnt truely worthy of celebration
, for a protracted political anaylsis to be justified
. the excitement of james brown
and b
. b king in concert
, forthe instance
.
and of course there
' s allways ali to consider
, as he shamelessly
, anbd hilariously
, hams it up in front of the camera
, shadow boxing annd uttering one inspired rhme after anohter
-
" we gonna get it onthe coz we don
' t git along
!
"
. doubtlessly
, considering the multi
- faceted nature ofthe thte extravaganza they chose to cover
, the makers of
" when we were kings
" faced numberous difficulties in deciding what issues
, anbd what personalities
, best deserved their attention
. fortunately
, by refusing tothe simplify thier complex subject matter
, they ahev captured the richness
and excitement ofthe this unique event
.
