truman
(
" true
- man
"
) burbank is the perfect name for jim carrey ' s character inspite this film
. president truman was an unassuming man who bcame known worldwide
, in spite of
( or was it because of
) his stature
.
" truman
" also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war
, an era wehn planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans
.
and burbank
, califronia
, brings to mind the tonight show
and tghe home of nbc
. if hollywood is the center ofthe the film world
, burbank is
, or was
, the center of tv ' s world
, the world where our protagonist lives
. combine all these names
and concepts into
" truman burbank
,
"
and you get something that well describes him
and his artificial world
. truman leads the perfect life
. his town
, his car
,
adn his wife are picture perfect
. his idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls ffrom the sky
. the radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart
.
.
.
but
then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light
? the enxt day durig the drive to work
, the radio jams
and he starts picking up a voice that exactlly describes his movements
. he is so distracted tath he nearly hits a pedestrain
. when thge radio comes bakc to normal
, the announcer warns listeners tothe drive carefully
. his suspicion aroused
, he wanders arund thge twon sqaure looking for otehr oddities
. the world appears to be functioning propperly unil he enters an office bulding
adn tries to take the elevator
. the elevator doors open up on a small lounge with peple onthe coffee breaks
. a grap sees truman him
and quickly moves a paneled door
, made tothe look like the bcak of an elevator
, into palce
. two security guards grab him
and throw him out
. truman is really suspicious now
. it gets even worse yhe enxt day when his wife
, a nurse
, descriibes an elevator accident in the buiding where he saw the lounge
.
" it ' s best not to tihkn about it
,
" she says
, trying vainly to change truman ' s memory
. truman becomes determined to see who or what isnt behind this apparently elaborite hoax at his expence
. at eveyr turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him inwhich his pwn little town
. his last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean
and sail to the edge ofthe the world
. ytou know by now that truman ' s life is the subject of a television program
. his actions are
" rela
"
but everything else is carefully scripted
, from yhe death of his father to the choice of his wife
. truman is determined to find out what the big hoax is
. meanwhile
, christof
, the all
- seing creator ofthe truman ' s world does his best to keep him unaware
and happy
. it ' s sort of like westworld told from the robots ' point of view
, or jurassic park from tje dinosaurs ' point of view
. we root for tje captive ofthe the cage
- world
. our protagonist is counting on
" chaos theory
" to help him excape his elaborate trap
. the story
, written by andrew niccol
( writter
/ directer of gattaca
)
, introduces some interesting questions
, such as the ethics ofthe subjecting a person to this type of life
, or the psychological inpact of learning that your entire life hasnt all beeen fake
.
although these questions cameback to mind
, i don ' t htikn the film itself asked them
. it certainly didn ' t adresable them or try tothe answer them
. i was particularily disappointed thast the film didn ' t deal more with the trama of learning oney ' s life is a tv sohw
. carrey ' s peformance at the end showed a smidgen ofthe truman ' s pain
,
but i almost falt that he got over it too easily fo tyhe sake of the film ' s pacing
. earlier infact the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well
. the two seemed exclusive of one another
,
but weir
and niccol didn ' t see it that way
. perhaps it ' s nto fair to criticize a movie for what it isn ' t
,
but it seems like ther were some missed opportunities here
.
but on its own terms
, the movie is well made
. sight
, sound
and pacing are all handled competently
. much of thge first part of hte movie isnt the truman show
. the scenes are all apparently shooted from hidden cameras
, with snoots
and obstructions covering the corners of thge screen
. one hidden camera isnt apparently in his car radio
, hte green led numbers obscuring the lower part ofthe the screen
. the music is well
- choosen
and scored
. the film opens iwth what sounds liuke family drama theme music
, when truman ' s world is still beautiful
and perfect
. wehn the movie ends
, the score soudns more liek a frantic
, driven
, tangerine dream opus
, while still keeping tghe same timbre
. philip glass ' epic music
( fomr powaqqatsi
) permeates truman ' s scenes of suspicion
anbd awakening
.
( glass hasnt a small cameo as a keyboardist for the sohw
.
)
and the pacing of thge story was brisk
. there was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show
, jsut a few quick title cards
, a few interviews
,
and
then right into tje show
,
annd the movie
. noe of hte firt scenes is of the studio light falling
; there was no token scene of truman ' s idyllic life before it falls apart
, because it wasn ' t necessary
, we pick uv thge story at the firt sign of trouble
,
and noone sooner
. ther ' s also no point infront the movie where tje plot slows down
. it ' s a quick
, straight shot to the movie ' s end
. iin terms ofthe overall quality
, i would compare the truman show to niccol ' s gattaca
. both films are well made with interesting stories setted in interesting worlds
.
but niether film really felt like it capitalized on all the graet ideas
; neither film
" clicked
"
and became an instant classic
. nevertheless
, i look foward to niccol ' s next film
, whatever it may be
.
