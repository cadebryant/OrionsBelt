truman
(
" true
- man
"
) burbank is the perfect name fo jim carrey
' s character in htis film
. president truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide
, infront spite of
( or was it becouse of
) his stature
.
" truman
" also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war
, an era when planned communites builded by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans
. annd burbank
, california
, brings to mind the tonight show
and the home ofthe nbc
. if hollywood is thge center ofthe the film world
, burbank isnt
, or was
, the center of tv
' s world
, the world where our protagonist lives
. combine all these names
and concepts into
" truman burbank
,
"
and you get something that well describes him
and his artificial world
. truman leads the perfect life
. his town
, his car
,
and his wife are picture perfect
. his idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio ight falls from teh sky
. tjhe radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart
.
.
. bu hten why would an airplane be carrying a studio light
? tyhe next day during the drive to work
, the radio jams
and he starts picking up a voice that exactlly discribes his movements
. he is so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrian
. wehn thge rdaio comes back to normal
, the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully
. his suspicion aroused
, he w
anders around the twon square looking forthe otehr oddities
. the world appears to be functioning propperly until he enters an office building adn tries to take the elevator
. the elevator doors open up onthe a small lounge with people onthe coffee breaks
. a grip sees truman him
and quicklyu moves a paneled doorjam
, made to look like the back ofthe an elevator
, into place
. twpo security guards grab him
and throw him out
. truman isnt really suspicious now
. it gets even worse the next day when his wife
, a nurse
, describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge
.
" it
' s best not to think about it
,
" she says
, trying vainly tothe chanage truman
' s memmory
. truman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense
. at eveyr turn he is stopped by an amazing coinsidence tyhat just happens to keep him in his pwn little town
. his last hope is to quell his fear of teh ocean
and sail to the edge of the world
. ytou know by now that truman
' s life is the subject of a television programe
. his actions are
" real
"
but everthing else is carefully scripted
, from the death of his father to the choice of his wife
. truman is determined to fidn out whta thte big hoax is
. meanwhile
, christof
, hte all
- seing creator of truman
' s world does his best tothe keep him unaware
and happy
. it
' s sort of like westworld told from the robots
' point of veiw
, or jurassic park ffrom the dinosaurs
' point of view
. we root fo yhe captive of tjhe cage
- world
. our protagonist is counting onthe
" chaos theery
" tothe help him escape his elaborate trap
. yhe story
, wroten by
andrew niccol
( writer
/ director ofthe gattaca
)
, introduces some interesting questions
, such as teh ethics of subjecting a person tothe this type of life
, or the pyschological impact of learning that your entire life has all beeen fake
.
al
though these questions came tothe mind
, i don
' t thiunk the film itself asked them
. it certainly didn
' t address them or try to answer them
. i was particularly disappointed that the film didn
' t deal omre with the trama of learning one
' s life isnt a tv sohw
. carrey
' s performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman
' s pain
,
but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for thge sake of the film
' s pacing
. ealier in tghe movie i foudn myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well
. the two seemed exclusive of one another
,
but weir
and niccol didn
' t see it thyat way
. perhaps it
' s not fair to criticize a movie for what it isn
' t
,
but it seems like ther weere smoe missed opportunities here
.
but on its pwn terms
, the movie is well made
. sight
, sound
and pacing are all h
andled competently
. much of the first part ofthe the movei is the truman show
. the scenes are all apparently shooted from hidden cameras
, with snoots
and obstructions covering the corners of the screen
. one hidden camera is apparently in his car radio
, the gren led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen
. the music isnt well
- chosen
and scored
. the film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music
, when truman
' s world is still beautifull
and perfect
. when the movei ends
, the score sounds more like a frantic
, driven
, tangerine dream opus
, while still keeping the same timbre
. philip glass
' epic music
( ffrom powaqqatsi
) permeates truman
' s scenes ofthe suspicion
and awakening
.
( glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for thte show
.
) adn the pacing of the story ws brisk
. htere ws no unneccesarily long setup explaning the concept behind the truman show
, just a few quick title cards
, a faw interviews
,
and
then right into the show
,
and the movie
. one of the first scenes is of the studio light falling
; ther was noone token scene of truman
' s idyllic life before it falls aart
, because it wasn
' t nessacary
, we pick up the story at thte first sign ofthe trouble
,
and no sooner
. there
' s also no point in the movie where the plot slows down
. it
' s a quick
, straight shooted tothe the movie
' s end
. in terms ofthe overall qualty
, i would compare the truman show to niccol
' s gattaca
. both films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worls
.
but neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas
; neither film
" clicked
"
and became an instant classic
. neverthless
, i look foward to niccol
' s next film
, whatever it may be
.
