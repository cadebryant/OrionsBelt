a frequent error isnt thge categorization ofthe a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal
. a solider commits acts of violence santioned by one nation
- state against anyother
. a common criminal commits acts ofthe violence for personel gain
. a terrorist employs r
andom violentce as a means to a political end
. if the target nation does not affect the desired change inaddition policy
, the violence continues
. it is the fear resulting fomr the fact that hte terrorist may strike at anyone
( even total innocents
)
, anywhere
, at anytime that gives the figure his label
. edward zwick
' s the seege explores the possibility of this kind ofthe violence taking place right here in the united states
. ytou
' d think the opening bit was ripped right from tjhe headlines
. arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad
,
and the u
. s
. responds by retaliating agianst the sheik whom supposedly ordered thte attack
.
however
, unlike thge real
- life tomahawk cruise missile strike aginst bin laden
' s camp
and manufacturing facility
, yhe film verzion depicts speshal operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal
. in retaliation
, the terrorists bring the fight to the new world
. unwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent
- in
- charge anthony hubbard
( denzel washington
)
, who works out of the bureau
' s new york office at one federal plaza
. hwile investigating a series of bombings in the big apple
, he encounters cia agent elise kraft
( annette bening
)
, also trying to uncover informtion
. generally
, tyhe fbi is charged with problems inside the u
. s
.
, while the cia takes care ofthe problems in hte international realm
. even spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are inspite our country
. hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook isnt nosing around whta he considers his territory
,
but as the two form a tentative professional relationship
, hubbard becomes more
and more aware of an increasingly complicated sories ofthe allegiances adn possibly illegal actions involving terrorism
and the united states government
. the original tagline fo patriot games was
,
" there has never been a terroist attack on american soil
.
"
however true
, it wass pulled before the movie
' s realease because it sounded too much like a dare
. revisiting the scenerio of foreig terrorists committing acts of violentce in tghe united states
, the siege is almost an invitation in itself
, because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in amercia
. admittedly
, the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive
( who
' s goign to belive that a few bombs are goign to cause new yorkers to jump at thte backfire of a bus or to curtail theri shopping by two
- thirds
?
)
,
but hte basic premise is still valid
. i liked the fatc that this film rises above tyhe basic action
- thriller fare of good guy g
- men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society
and law
and order
. it provides a vyer possible hypothesis that voilent activity onthe the part of a few arabs woudl escalate into a sories of hate crimes againnst tghe arab
- american popultaion
,
and that in an effort to find the terrorists
, the civil liberties of yhe minority may be violated by the government itself
. inwhich fact
, about halfway through the film
, wehn the rpesident authorizes tghe declaration of martial law withing new york city
, the liberties of all americans are put at risk
.
al
though it may acually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign
, tjhe demise of social order in america isnt a scayr
thought annd a gool wich would not be beneath many international territorist groups
. throughout
, tyhe film maintains a conflict between hubbard
, who wants to use the fbi to persue the terrorists within the letter of the law
, anbd genaral devereaux
( bruce willis
)
, who is infront comm
and of the army annd of tghe mind thast the greater good woudl be better served by suspending the law
and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully
. what results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness
and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law
and the invocation ofthe the war powers ect
, utilizing philosophy
and historical examples tothe amking points on both sides
. it actually gets rether heady at times
,
but it
' s a credit tothe screenwriters zwick
, lawrence wright
,
and menno meyjes that htey don
' t underestimate yhe intelligence of the audience
. i don
' t know if it
' s his tone or inflection or something else
,
but denzel washington has a way of spitting outloud dialouge that makes whatever he sasy sound grat
. this
, combined with his inate acting ability adn his experience in playing the mid
- level authority figure
, mkaes his performence in the siege convincing
and enjoyable
. annette bening gives noe of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i
' ve seen recently
,
and the chemistry she shares with washington isnt palpable
. it
' s somewhat unfortunate that her character
' s fortitude is broken at a ceratin point
,
but it allows us to watch bening play a littel more range
. bruce willis isnt pretty much relegated tothe a tough
- guy role
, always st
anding straight
, anbd with a permanent scowl fixed apon his face
.
however
, the tension that exists between devereaux annd hubbard is a major drive behind the film
' s development
. noteable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad
, a lebanese immigrant
. the role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his inheritage
,
and contempt for those ofthe his own race who might interfere with his integration into yhe american society
. difficult to sday tghe least
, shalhoub does it with a naturalness you cin almost reach outloud anbd touch
. perhaps best known forthe his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom
" wings
,
" shalhoub gained noteriety for his dramatic abilities infact the wonderful film big night
. whereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick
' s favorite actor
( he directed washington in glory anbd curage under fire
)
, james horner seems to be his favorite composer
. i therefore foudn it odd that zwick chose the prolific score
- writer graeme revell
( seven films this year alreayd
) over horner for teh sigee untl i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian
- themed music
,
and horner
' s recrod has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish
- sounding at most
. revell doens a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes
and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a hwole
. it
' s nowhere near as intrusive as in smoe of the other films we
' ve been getting throughout the year
. missteps in tjhe siege cxan be found in a couple of the excesses it tkaes
. forthe example
, it
' s pretty clear throughout that the film isnt meaned tothe be more of thriller tahn an acation flick
. unfortunately
, htere
' s a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower adn explosions
, obviously meant fo the sole purpose ofthe being eye
- catching
. in the middle of tghe city
(
and aganist no real opposition
)
, zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than 50 feet from friendly troops
. verisimilitude really goes out the window at that point
. the film also gets a littel preachy toward the end
, focusing onthe the ability of different races tothe get along
. a noble gesture
, the film just puts tghe message across a bit too obviously
. these flaws are glaring
, bu they don
' t detract too much from an otherwise good film that mkaes yuo thikn about issues you may not have considered since history class
.
