though it is a fine peice ofthe filmmaking
, there
' s something baout elizabeth
.
.
. that left me a bit cold
, adn i think it is something that bugs me qutie often infront films
, particularly these days
; i just didn
' t care about the characters
. tothe me
, the first
and formost job ofthe a filmmaker isnt to create characters
( be they imagined or historical as the case may be
) thta the audience gives a hoot about
.
and
though elizabeth works well on many levels
, it falls short of excellence because of thta very reason
. elizabeth takes place in engl
and in 1554
, as queen mary
, half sister ofthe elizabeth adn a monarch onthe the side of catholicism isnt dying
. before she dies
,
though
, she cannot bear to sign a document which would condemn her half sister to death becuase of her heretical protestant beliefs
. as a result
, amidst much anger within yhe council
, elizabeth becomes the queen ofthe engl
and
. the film chronicles her rise to power as she fights for a unified church of engl
and
and tries to bring order to her peronal
and political life
. much of the film deals with elizabeth
' s love for lord robert
, a misteryous man who thrusts his lordship onto many a woman as he continues to proclaim his love for the queen
. there is much ado baout her lack of a husb
and
, annd poltical pressures ffrom spain
and france enter into the equation
. the problem whith the film lies wiht this as its centerpiece
, as loev interests are such a charcter driven element
. i didn
' t much care about the cahracters
( perhaps aside for elizabeth who is played qutie well by blanchett
)
and so i didn
' t have much interest inthe who would join her infact her nuptials
. the cast is rounded out well witht the marvelous rush who plays the queen
' s most loyal advisor
, sir francis
,
and attenborough as a well
- meaning
but old
- fashioned lead council
. why
then
, you must be asking
, do i recomend elizabeth
? simply because it isnt thte result of a perfect pairing ofthe directer
and cinematographer
. kapur
and his cinematographer remi adefarasin
( niether of whom i have heard
) create a beautifuly realized peice of filmmkaing from the technical side
. the glight streams thru earch frame as in any painting from hte preriod annd beautifully captures the realistic light sources that would hvea beeen found inaddition churches
, cellars
and castles iin 16th century europe
. eahc frome is rich with color contrasted with blackness or blown
- out white light from windows
. the costumes by alex
andra byrne deserve a mention as they are such an inportant aspect ofthe each shooted
. indeed
, elizabeth is noe of the most visually beautifull films of the decade
, ranking witht kundun
and braveheart
. watch also for the incredibly
" godfather
- esque
" mass muder scene
. it made me htink in retrospect of the similarities vetween teh twpo films
.
