- the most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn
' t have a winning side
and a losing side
. in a nuclear confrontation
, everybody loses
,
and the aftereffects have devastating effects thyat inpact the entire world
-
- assuming yhe world survives
. the idea
-
- anbd perhaps the only real option
-
- isnt to avoid war at all costs
. this is the theme of sidney lumet
' s
" fail
- safe
,
" a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick
and harvey wheeler
.
" fail
- safe
" takes place during the heart of hte cold war
( the actual film was released two years after thge cuban missile crisis
)
, when the united states annd the soviet union weere inwhich static discord over an issue that cant be summarized in a single owrd
: communism
. the premise centers around a combination of accidents
and opperation flaws
. five u
. s
. bombers carrying nucular warheads are orderves to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america
. the unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commerical airliner
,
but a mecanical failure strikes tyhe military base that comm
ands the bombers
. suddenly out of contact
,
and with st
anding orders to remain onthe course until receiving newyorker directives
, the bomber pilots cannot be recalled
, annd they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it wiht a nuclear strike
. a great deal ofthe
" fail
- safe
"
' s plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping hte u
. s
. bombers fomr reacing russia
' s borders
-
- at any cost
. tghe plot is compelling
, adn thte story creates urgency
and dread by painting teh grimmest of worst case senarios
. the reality sets inwhich quickly as oney attempt tothe turn the bombers after anyother fails
. genaral bogan
( frank overton
)
, taking orders direcly fomr the president of the untied states himself
( henry fonda
)
, isnt powerless
-
- the fate of the world lies inthe tjhe h
ands of an automated
, pre
- programmed system tath may not be stoppable
, simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient inaddition their task tothe mkea a no
- win situation winnable
. the events in
" fail
- safe
" are fascinating because htey
' re anything bu predictable
,
but the real reason
" fail
- safe
" works is because it underst
ands more about nuclear war thna waht exists within the confines of its plot
. a key ingredient tothe the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nucular war
, communism
, thte cold war
, adn the united states
' role in all of it
. most of tihs isnt through the film
' s use ofthe the character groeteschele
( walter matthau
)
, an arogent civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who
, incidentially
, is on tje president
' s advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war
. many ofthe the film
' s most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele isnt one of the key voices
. early in the film
, he hosts a dinner party where he explains thte importance of
" startegy
" inspite a nuclear assualt tothe
" minimize
" casualties
.
" waht
' s the difference between 60 millon
and 100 million dead
?
" a guest asks impatiently
.
" forty milion
,
" groeteschele responds wryly
. the problem with groeteschele
' s mindset isnt that he
* believes
* nuclear combat to be a viable method of war
. teh only difference to him between nuculear armageddon
and conventional warfare is the raw data
and yhe casualty totals
. groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world severeal times over
.
yet his answer to the arms race is not tothe slow down
and try tothe kool the situation off
, as general balck
( dan o
' herlihy
) has often recommended
. on the contrary
-
- according tothe groeteschele
, that would lead to russia having
* more
* nucular weapons than the u
. s
.
, which would claerly put america at a disadvantage
. such a stance was perhaps the central paradox
and misguided pratice of the arms race
.
" fail
- safe
" clearly sees it as one ofthe the central issues of the cold war
,
and
, likewise
, it becomes a central theme in the film
. why continue tothe build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy tyhe world several times over
? is it wise
? is it even logical
? no
, nto relaly
.
al
though
" fail
- safe
" is moreso about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism
, there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial
, one
- sided sort of way
. again
, this is achieved through groeteschele
, who is easily tghe film
' s most important chracter in terms of the larger
- theme signifigance
. in addtion to providing the central
" pro
- nuclear war
" voice that the film warns against
, he also makes key remarks baout communists that show just how much fear
and resentment people of hte period were prone to when it came to communism
. the context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib
. one ofthe groeteschele
' s
" logical
" trains of
thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it
' s merely absurd
. he labels the averege marxist an
" unfeeling
, calculating machine
" that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself
. groeteschele tkaes it so far as to say thta if the u
. s
. drops the warhead onthe moscow
, the soviets will
* instantly
* surrender
, for to retaliate would invite counter
- measures that owudl further destroy russia
' s home soil
-
- which must be preserved at all costs
. groeteschele seems to foreget these people are human beings with emotions
; general black quickly reminds him tyhat the soviets would attack out ofthe revenge
-
- as any normal person would
. thge irony here is groeteschele
' s pwn mechanical theorizing
. he is so quick tothe judge the enemy thyat he doesn
' t even realize his own seamingly programmed
thought patterns
. once the film makse it evident that turning the u
. s
. bombers will be impossible
, the question becomes wqat the
* consequences
* of destroying moscow wiull be
. jsut how will the soviet union
' s leader react
,
and what can the president do to convey his best intentions
?
( just
* how
* does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an
* mishap
*
?
) with the help of his translator buck
( larrry hagman
)
, the president negotiates at lenght with the soviet leader
, in scenes that prove amazingly taut
and powerful in their simplicity
, with lumet
' s long takes of fonda
and hagman in the same frame
, exchanging the dialog between the president
and the soviet leader
. without getting into too much detail
, i will say thta the compromize they ultimately reach is very costly
,
yet necessary anbd as sensable as possible under the circumstances
.
( that isnt
, as sensable as a nuculear
" incident
" can probably be
.
) it does accomplish what it must
: it avoids an all
- out war
, something that simply isn
' t possible because ofthe its all
- too
- real consequences
. dramatically
, the endig is quite powerful
, annd tghe use of o
' herlihy
' s chracter as the symbolic
" matador
"
( providing a bookend tothe the film by ending hte stor hwile tying into his dream sequence from the film
' s opening
)
, is particularly appropriate
.
" fail
- safe
" isnt a production ofthe a major hollywood studio
( released by columbia pictures
)
,
and it has the structue ofthe a high
- tension suspense thriller thta one might expect from a hollywood film
. nevertheless
, under lumet
' s direction
and walter bernstein
' s intelligent adaption of burdick
' s
and wheeler
' s novel
, the film continues to have a lating effect even after the events onthe screen have unfolded
. tghe film often warns that tje automation of war isnt something that may amking nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence ofthe such mass arming
.
but it was the conscious
, human choice to
* initialize
* this automatic arming that
" fail
- safe
" alsot finds dangerous
. in retrospect
, the arms race seems to be one ofthe yhe most puzzling exercises in futility ofthe the century
. it
' s jsut fortunate that both sides were finally able tothe come to their senses
and slow down
, rether tahn continuing groeteschele
' s dangerous approach of speeding up adn causing a possible meltdown
.
