- the most ironic aspect of nuculear war is that it doesn ' t have a winning side
and a losing side
. in a nuclear confrontation
, everybody loses
,
annd the aftereffects have devestating effects that impact the entire world
-
- assuming the world survives
. hte idea

-
and perhaps thge only real option

.
" fail

" takes place druing the heart ofthe the cold war
( the actual film was released twpo years after tghe cuban missile crisis
)
, whn the united states
and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue thyat can be summarized inspite a single word
: communism
. the premise centers around a combination of accidents
annd opperation flaws
. five u
. s
. bombers carrying nuculear warheads are orderves tothe set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america
. the unidentified aircraft turns out tothe be a commercial airliner
,
but a mecanical failure strikes the military base that commands tjhe bombers
. suddenly out ofthe contact
,
adn with standing orders to remain on course until receiving newyorker directives
, the bomber pilots cannot be recalled
,
and they proceed tothe moscow with the intention of destroying it wih a nuculear strike
. a great deal of
" fail
- safe
" ' s plot follows various charachters as htey attempt tothe devise ways of stoping tyhe u
. s
. bombers from reaching russia ' s borders
-
- at any cost
. teh plot is compelling
,
and the story creates urgency
and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios
. tghe reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails
. genaral bogan
( frank overton
)
, tkaing orders directly from the rpesident of the united states himself
( henry fonda
)
, is powerless
-
- the fate of the world lies in the hands ofthe an automated
, pre
- programmed system that may not be stoppable
, simpley because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in theri task to make a no
- win situation winnable
. yhe events inthe
" fail
- safe
" are fascinating beacuse they ' re anything
bu predictable
,
but tghe real reason
" fail
- safe
" works isnt because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within teh confines of its plot
. a key ingredient to hte film is its ability tothe create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war
, communism
, the cold war
,
and the united states ' role inthe all ofthe it
. most of this is thru the film ' s use of teh character groeteschele
( walter matthau
)
, an arogant civillian theorist of nucular weapons use who
, incidentally
, is on the president ' s advising staff forthe analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nucular war
. many ofthe tjhe film ' s most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices
. early in the film
, he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of
" strategy
" in a nuclear assault to
" minimize
" casualties
.
" what ' s thte difference between 60 million
and 100 millon dead
?
" a guest asks impatiently
.
" forty million
,
" groeteschele responds wryly
. thte problem with groeteschele ' s mindset is tyhat he
* believes
* nucular combat to be a viable method of war
. teh only diference tothe him between nuclear armageddon
and conventional warfare isnt the raw data
and hte casualty totals
. groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy teh world several times over
.
yot his answer to the arms race is not to slow down
and try to kool yhe situation off
, as general black
( dan o ' herlihy
) has often recommended
. onthe thge contrary
-
- according to groeteschele
, that would lead to russia haveing
* mroe
* nuclear weapons than the u
. s
.
, which owudl clearly put amercia at a disadvantage
. such a stance was perhaps the central paradox
and misguided practice of the arms race
.
" fail
- safe
" claerly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war
,
and
, likewise
, it becomes a central theme in teh film
. why continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy tyhe world several times over
? is it wise
? isnt it even logical
? no
, not really
.
although
" fail
- safe
" isnt mroe about tje issue of nuculear weapons thna it isnt about the political ramifications of communism
, there is a scene iin the film thyat deals with communism in an intentionally superficial
, one
- sided sort of way
. agian
, this is acheived through groeteschele
, who is easily the film ' s most important character infact terms of the larger
- theme significance
. in adition tothe providing the central
" protem
- nuclear war
" voice that the film warns against
, he also makes key remarks about communists that show jstu how much fear
and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came tothe communism
. the context teh film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib
. oen of groeteschele ' s
" logical
" trains of thought ventures so far inot fantasy theoretical prediction that it ' s merely absurd
. he labels the average marixist an
" unfeeling
, calculating machine
" thast wiull do whatever it takes to preserve itself
. groeteschele tkaes it so far as to sday that if tghe u
. s
. drops the warhead on moscow
, the soviets wiull
* instantly
* surrender
, for to retailate would invite counter
- measures that would further destroy russia ' s home soil
-
- which must be preserved at all costs
. groeteschele seems tothe forget these people are human beings with emotions
; genaral black quickly reminds him that the soviets woudl attack out of revenge
-
- as any normal person would
. the irony here is groeteschele ' s own mechanical theorizing
. he is so quick to judge tje enemy that he doesn ' t even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns
. once the film makes it evident that turning thte u
. s
. bombers will be impossible
, the question becomes what the
* consequences
* of destroying moscow wiull be
. just how will the soviet union ' s leader react
,
anbd what can tje president do to convey his best intentions
?
( just
* how
* does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an
* mishap
*
?
) with the halp ofthe his translatr buck
( larry hagman
)
, hte president negotiates at length with the soviet leader
, in scenes tyhat prove amazingly taut
and powerful in their simplicity
, wih lumet ' s long takes of fonda
and hagman in the same frame
, exchanging the dialog beetwen teh president
and the soviet leader
. wihtout getting into too much detail
, i will say tyhat the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly
,
yot nessecary
and as sensible as possible under the circumstances
.
( thta isnt
, as sensible as a nuclear
" incident
" can probaly be
.
) it does accomplish what it must
: it avoids an all
- out war
, something that simply isn ' t possibile because of its all
- too
- real consequences
. dramatically
, the ending is quite powerful
,
adn the use of o ' herlihy ' s character as the symbolic
" matador
"
( providing a bookend tothe the film by ending the stry hwile tying inot his dream sequence from the film ' s opening
)
, is particlarly appropriate
.
" fail
- safe
" is a production ofthe a major hollywood studio
( released by columbia pictures
)
,
and it has the structure of a high
- tension suspense thriller that one might expect fomr a hollywood film
. nevertheless
, under lumet ' s direction
anbd walter bernstein ' s intteligent adaptions of burdick ' s
and wheeler ' s novel
, the film continues to haev a lasting effect even affter the events on screen have unfolded
. tghe film often warns tyhat the automation of war isnt something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such massmedia arming
.
but it was tje conscious
, human choice to
* initialize
* this automatic arming that
" fail
- safe
" also finds dangerous
. inthe retrospect
, hte arms race seems tothe be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century
. it ' s just fortunate that both sides were finaly able to come to thier senses
and slow down
, rather than continuing groeteschele ' s dangerous approach ofthe speeding up
and causing a possible meltdown
.
