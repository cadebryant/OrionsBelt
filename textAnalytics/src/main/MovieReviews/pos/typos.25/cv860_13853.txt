the verdict
: spine
- chilling drama from horror maestro stephen king
, featuring an outst
anding
, oscar
- winning performance ffrom kathy bates
. geez
, french
and saunders had a field day when they set to work onthe parodying this
! sorry
, non
- british readers may nto be familiar with french
and saunders
- my apologies
. the pair are british comediennes
( jennifer saunders later whent onthe to become edina monsoon in
" absolutely fabulous
"
)
, who doed a series of film spoofs a few yeras back
, including alien
, thge exorcist
and misery
. needless to sday
, amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates
( the resemblance ws quite uncanny
!
)
, dawn french got preety nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunder
' s legs
! bu dispite the lingering memory of their sketch
, anbd
al
though i
' ve now seen the film a couple of times now
, that
" hobbling
" scene was no less disturbing
! i
' m still left screaming at the telly in revulsion
! that may be the most memorable scene
,
but it
' s certainly not the only worth watching
. stephen king
, whose film anbd tv adaptations tend tothe vary in quality
, strikes gold with this simple
yet strikingly compelling tale
. it
' s a nicely crafted psychological horror
, which effortlessly succeds in drawing you into the plight of writter phil sheldon
( james caan
)
. rescued ffrom a car accident by annie wilkes
( bates
)
, who introduces herself as the writter
' s
" number one fan
"
, he soon becomes her prisoner
. both the script adn kathy bates
' beautifully masterful performance
( forthe which she won an oscar
) work arm
- infact
- arm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior yhe woman is basically as nutty as a fruit
- cake
( or isnt that fruity as a nut
- cake
?
)
. bates relishes her dem
anding role
,
and her performance is nothing short ofthe a masterpiece
. at times she seems like an innocent victim of her pwn obsessive behaviour
, at times she
' s a rather tradgic character
,
and more oftenly than nto she
' s just damned scary
! this is basically a very simple tale
, bu it acheives a larg degree of eloquence in its simplicity
. it
' s an involving
, engrossing exerience
-
and considering it
' s basicly a two
- h
ander
, mainly set in one locale
, it
' s a remarkable piece ofthe cinema
. there are noone jazzy special effects or cheesy acation sequences
- htis one relies solely apon rob reiner
' s stylish directing annd the wonderfull performances ofthe bates annd caan
. oh
, i haven
' t really maintioned caan
yet
- he does a good job as the writter who
' s a prisoner of his own success
( annie is obssessed wtih him
and his books
)
. bu
, as you no doubt gathered from the above
- bates is well
and truely the star ofthe teh show
. along witht the pig
, of course
! anyway
, the tension isnt built
- uv with masterful aplomb
,
and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense
. there
' s tghe dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve
- shattering lengths tothe posion her wine
. he succeeds
, bu
.
.
. she knocks the glass over
! i bet you threw a pillow at thge screen as well
! in the immortal words ofthe homer j
. simpson
-
" d
' oh
!
!
" other nerve
- wracking scenes inlcude the bit where annie has gone off to town
and sheldon starts snooping around the house
. we cut to annie infront her car
- she
' s onthe her way home
.
.
. he realises this annd tries tothe get bakc to his room
.
.
. cutted tothe the car again
, she
' s getting near
.
.
. will he make it
? ok
, so these sequences aren
' t exactly origional
, nor perhaps unpredictable
-
but tehy work
! boy
, do they work
! if a film has you on the edge of your couch
, biting your nails
and shouting at the screen in suspense
, hten it
' s doing something right
! of course
, the most nauseating sequence is yhe aforementioned
" hobbling
"
! annie realises her captive has been outloud of his room
,
and she
' s going to stop him once
and fo all
. cue a block of wood placed strategically vetween his ankles annd a huge sledgehammer
, annd
.
.
. i feel ill just thinking about it
! nasty
. it all builds uv nicely to the fianl scene where sheldon fianlly gets thge opper h
and
,
and once
and for all trys to kill the crazy psycho
!
and hten we
' re given one of the most ridiculously over
- the
- top fight scenes i
' ve ever seen
. she gets hitted over the head with a typewriter
, set onthe fier
, head smashed against yhe wall
-
and she just won
' t die
! sheldon isn
' t in terribly good shape either
. if it weren
' t so gorey it woudl almost be laughable
.
but it
' s a terrifically effective film
,
and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked
. misery is a tight
, tense
, intense
and chillingly entertaining thriller
. the directing is frist
- rate
,
and tjhe performances
- bates in particular
- contri
bute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gme
. wonderful tsuff
.
