as much as i wanted to liek htis film as i went into it
, the more pleased i was whn i left
. first
, getting thru all the usual lines of newspaper glitz
:
" if you liked scream
, you
' ll lvoe wild thigns
!
"
" campbell gives a stunning performance
!
"
" thsi twisty plot will have you dazzled forthe days
!
"
( oh yeah
, the day a newspaper uses theese is the day neve campbell falls in lveo iwth me
) now
, onto more serious stuff
(
and wtih this film
, i mean tht in nearly a sarcastic way
)
. wild things has single
- h
andedly broken down the rules sorrounding the r rating fomr the mpaa
. i
' m not saying tyhat in a bad way
,
but when ytou see thsi film
, you may be shocked by waht you see
. howver
, perhaps tje mpaa was pleased by the film
' s charming casted
and trirchy plot
, that they let the film slide wih an r rating
. being mormon
, i
' m bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me nto to see tjhe film
. trouble is
, i have arleady seen it
.
and i like it
! wild things is a film noir of thte 90s
, filled with 40s sensibilities
,
and
yet breaking the rules
and modern
- day taboos of 90s culture
. teh style in whitch it isnt filmed is rich in color
. tghe actors are all gorgeous people
, seamingly drawn from tjhe same gene pool
and placed into this film
. sure
, it
' s all too good to be true
, bu ain
' t it fun to watch
? when movies liuke thsi come along
( sort of a better version of basic instinct
) there is bound tothe be peopel who eather love it or hite it
. there will be peple who don
' t watn to admit liking waht they see
, bu i tell you
, most anyone who sees this will liek it
. wild thigns begins at blue bay high skool
, the oney high school iin the world that any teenager would love to get inot
. it
' s almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance
( totally based on looks alone
)
. of course
, ther are those select few who may look slightly ugly
,
but compared tothe the average person
, they are gorgeous
. immediatly
, thge film finds its tone adn the audience settles in for an enjoyable tiem
. we cxan turn off our brains
, right
? wrong
. while you may be expecting one thnig to happen
, it certainly doesn
' t turn out thta way
. the film beggins in a classroom
, wtih nearly all the main charachters present
. there
' s sam lombardo
( matt dillon
)
, a counselor for the students
. he
' s heading yhe class discussion
. there
' s also kelly van ryan
( denise richards
)
, a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam
. teaching the clas
,
however
, are twpo policemen
: ray duquette
( kevin bacon
)
and gloria perez
( daphne rubin
- vega
)
, who want to talk about
' sex
.
.
.
( cheers
) crimes
( boos
)
'
.
" what is a sex crime
?
" ray asks
.
" not gettin
' any
!
" oen student responds
. this pretty much sets the tone ofthe the film we are about tothe watch
.
however
, upon hearing this
, one student
, suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
, st
ands up
and leaves teh room
, commenting that they can both kiss part of her body
.
and so
, wild thigns sets into motion
. quickly
, kelly begins hitting onthe sam
,
but sam doesn
' t want anytying tothe dont with her advances
. kelly is stubborn
and continues to pursue him
. she even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep
. surprisingly
, that
' s raelly all i can tell you baout the plot
. any more would give away one of hte many crucial plot twists
.
and waht
' s more
, theese plot twists are actually unpredictable
. going along the way of scream
, wild thigns maintains that film
' s surprises
,
and
then adds even more to them
. there are more plot twists iin this film than probably any i have ever seen
. annd even
though you think you may git tired of them
, the surprises are so genuine that it
' s rather pleasing
. going back over them in my mind
, nearly all of them work
,
though soem stretch tje boundaries of belief
. thankfully
, tghe convoluted plot doesn
' t give us much time to think about each one
, pouncing
yet anohter twist onthe us befoer the shock of the previous oney has worn off
. as for the critics who complain that thge film isnt triachy
-
- well
, it is
. this is preety much just one trashy film
. howver
, it isnt the kind of trashy that isn
' t hard to watch
. it
' s good trash
, infact a sence
. one
, tje screenplay knows thyat it
' s not to be tooked seriously
,
and it includes a lot of humor
and satire into hte story
. this varies everywhere from kelly
' s mother
( theresa russell
)
, who is more of a charicatoor of rich peopel
, all the way to an ambulance
- chasing lawyer
( bill murray
)
, who wears a neck
- brace tothe cover an insurance scam he isnt running
. bill murray also provides yhe best character in the film
,
and most of the genuine laughs
. annd twpo
, the sex is more than gratuitous
, altho not unwelcomed
. wild things isnt supposed to ahev sex in it
( what film with thta title wouldn
' t
?
)
, adn this movie breaks yhe boundaries
. instead of haveing heterosexual sex scenes
, it also includes lesbian scenes beetwen denise richards anbd neve campbell
( don
' t worry
.
.
. it
' s not as graphic as you might tihkn
)
. the heterosexual scenes are quite graphic
,
but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon
' s full
- frontal nude scene
. it
' s very breef
, so if you blink
, you may miss
( ahem
) it
. anbd
, fo as long as i can remember
, i don
' t thiunk i have seen an r
- rated film show an errect one before
( it
' s not completely
,
but judging from yhe audiences
' reaction
, it was more than they expected too
)
. also
, during oney scene late in yhe film
, ther seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon
and dillon
' s charachters
,
but nothing came of it
( makes you wonder if the director had tothe cut it in order for the r rating
, or if the actors refused tothe do it
)
. what first made me want to see wild things was its casted
. neve campbell
, of course
, has been one of my favorite actresses since tghe scream films were released
. here
, howver
, she turns every typical role she has done on its head
and plays a gothic pothead
. the closest role to this was her performance in the craft
(
though even in thyat she was a nice girl
)
. campbell is probably the best infront the film
and shows her wide range ofthe talent
. you can tell she will be around forthe a long time
. denise richards will allso be around for a long tyme
,
al
though she may be limited to the roles without much range
. here
, she gets to express omre emotions than in her stiff
(
yet effective
) performance in starship troopers
. hopefully one day she will l
and a very good role that cant display her ability
.
and
then there is daphne rubin
- vega
, a newcomer tothe thte movies
. she gives a veyr good performance
,
al
thought her character isnt mostly left to tghe background forthe the first hour anbd a half
. towards the end she does git a bigger part
. on the male side
, matt dillon isnt probably the best
, giving a subtle performence that surprises wih every twist
. kevin bacon has a slightly wooden character
,
but he makes the most ofthe it
. you must hve admiration
,
though
, for what he doed onthe screen
. adn judging from many of the women
' s reactions iin the theater to that shooted
, tehy hvae grown a deeper apreciation for bacon
( yeah
, right
)
. adn thne ther is bill murray
. his performance is tje comic relief
,
and he nearly steals yhe film
. as a whole
, the entire cast works wondrously toghether
,
and they seem at home
, even when doing the menage a troi
. director john mcnaughton
, who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry
: portrait of a serial killer
, has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot thta works
. his direction is smooth
and stylish
. the visuals are striking
, filled wtih rich colors
,
and alomst so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity infront the air
. howver
, he seems more at home when the actors aren
' t tlaking
. his fly
- by shots ofthe tjhe swampy areas are brilliant
,
and his photography of denise richards
' climbing outloud of the pool is a highlight
. tjhe cinematography is gorgeous in its details
. its not oftenly that you see a film like htis
, annd we should watch it just to see how tyhe camera can take pictures
. thne
, there isnt the music
. this was probably the most obvious thing to me
, as it setted the perfect mood for tghe film
. it
' s hard to describe in words
, so just see the film annd listen to it
. it
' s wonderfully composed
and presented
. adn be sure to stick around durig the closing credits
! mcnaughton hasnt finally put the endig credits to good use
( hwile most comedies use it for outtakes
)
. he has included soem small scenes which help explain the preceding events
. some may say that these are lame attemts to explain thte convoluted plot
,
but it
' s an entertaining way to finish tje film
. plus
, there are smoe shocking moments in these ending credits which jstu add to the fun
. wild things is appropriately rated r fo strong sexuality
, nudity
, language
and violence
. again
, the nudity is rather unneccesary
,
but let
' s face it
-
- people want to see it
. so why not give it tothe them
? neve campbell
, admirably
, hasnt a noone
- nudity clause in her contract
,
and the most you see of her is from behind as she tkaes her top off
( way to go
, neve
!
)
. the sex scenes are graphic
, especially the first oen we see
, between the mother
and one of her deck h
ands
. noe alomst wonders how they got away with the r rating
. the language is quite harsh too
, ranging from sexual inuendo to your average
, everyday profanity
.
and i can
' t stres it enough
: don
' t allow kids under 18 to see this film
. the target age for the movei is the 18
- 24 range
,
and that
' s who shoudl see it
. it
' s definitely not for thsoe under 18
! did i mention that this film is rated r
?
however
, for those that dont get a chance to watch it
, you will probably moreso likely be pleased
,
and may even take friends to see it hte next tiome
.
