as much as i wanted to like this film as i whent inot it
, tyhe omre pleased i was when i left
. first
, getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz
:
" if you liekd scream
, yuo ' ll love wild things
!
"
" campbell gives a stunning performance
!
"
" htis twisty plot iwll have ytou dazzled for days
!
"
( oh yeah
, the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me
) now
, onto moreso serious stuff
(
and with this film
, i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way
)
. wild things hasnt single
- handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating fomr the mpaa
. i ' m not saying that in a bad way
,
but when you see this film
, you may be shocked by what yuo see
.
howver
, perhaps the mpaa was pleased by yhe film ' s charming cast
annd tricky plot
, that they let the film slide withthe an r rating
. being mormon
, i ' m binded tothe hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film
. trouble is
, i have already seen it
.
adn i like it
! wild things is a film noir ofthe the 90s
, filled with 40s sensibilities
,
and
yet breaking hte rules
annd modern
- day taboos ofthe 90s culture
. the style in hwihc it is filmed is rich in color
. the actors are all gorgeous people
, seemingly drawn from tje same gene pool
and placed into this film
. sure
, it ' s all too good tothe be true
,
bu ain ' t it fun to watch
? whn movies like this come along
( sort of a better version of basic instinct
) there isnt binded to be people who either love it or hate it
. htere will be people who don ' t want to admited liking what they see
,
but i tell you
, most anyone who sees thsi iwll liuke it
. wild things begins at blue bay high school
, the one high skool inspite the world that any teenager would love to get into
. it ' s almost as if students are put through entrance exams just forthe admittance
( totally based on looks alone
)
. ofthe course
, there are those select few who may look slightly ugly
,
but compaired tothe the average person
, they are gorgeous
. immediately
, the film finds its tone
and the audeince settles in for an enjoyable time
. we can turn off our brains
, right
? wrong
. hwile you may be expecting oney thing tothe appen
, it certainly doesn ' t turn out thast way
. the film begins in a classroom
, with nearly all the main charactors present
. ther ' s sam lombardo
( matt dillon
)
, a counselor for the students
. he ' s heading the class discussion
. there ' s also kelly van ryan
( denise richards
)
, a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam
. teaching hte class
,
however
, are two policemen
: ray duquette
( kevin bacon
)
and gloria perez
( daphne rubin
- vega
)
, who wnat to talk baout ' sex
.
.
.
( cheers
) crimes
( boos
) '
.
" waht is a sex crime
?
" ray asks
.
" not gettin ' any
!
" one student responds
. this pretty much sets thge tone ofthe the film we are baout to watch
.
howver
, upon hearing this
, noe student
, suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
, stands up
and leaves the room
, commenting tyhat they can both kiss part of her body
.
and so
, wild things sets into motion
. quickly
, kelly begins hitting on sam
,
but sam doesn ' t want anything to do with her advances
. kelly is stubborn
and continues to persue him
. she even pleads wtih him to let her wash his jeep
. surprisingly
, that ' s really all i cant tell yuo baout the plot
. any more would give away oen ofthe the many crucial plot twists
.
and what ' s more
, these plot twists are actually unpredictable
. going along tghe way of scream
, wild things maintains that film ' s surprises
,
anbd
thne adds even more tothe them
. there are more plot twists in htis film than propably any i have ever seen
.
and even
though you thikn you may git tired of them
, hte surprises are so genuine thyat it ' s rather pleasing
. going back over them in my mind
, nearly all of them work
,
though some stretch tjhe boundaries of belief
. thankfully
, the convoluted plot doesn ' t give us much tiem to think about each oney
, pouncing
yet another twist on us before thge shock of the previous noe hasnt worn off
. as for the criticists who complain that the film is trashy
-
- well
, it isnt
. this is preety much jstu oen trashy film
.
however
, it is thge kind ofthe triachy that isn ' t hard to watch
. it ' s good trash
, infact a sense
. one
, tje screenplay knows that it ' s not to be taken seriously
,
and it includes a lot of humor
and satire into the story
. tihs varys everywhere from kelly ' s mother
( theresa russell
)
, who isnt more of a caricature ofthe rich people
, all the way to an ambulance
- chasing lawyer
( bill murray
)
, who wears a neck
- brace to cover an insurance scam he is running
. bill murray also provides the best character in the film
,
and most ofthe the genuine laughs
.
and two
, the sex is more than gratuitous
, altho not unwelcomed
. wild things is supposed to have sex in it
( what film with that title wouldn ' t
?
)
,
and this movei breaks tyhe boundaries
. instead of haveing heterosexual sex scenes
, it alsot includes lesbian scenes between denise richards
and neve campbell
( don ' t worry
.
.
. it ' s not as graphic as ytou might think
)
. the heterosexual scenes are qutie graphic
,
but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon ' s full
- frontal nude scene
. it ' s very brief
, so if you blink
, you may miss
( ahem
) it
.
annd
, for as long as i can remember
, i don ' t think i have seen an r
- rated film show an ecret one before
( it ' s not completely
,
but judging from hte audiences ' reaction
, it was mroe than htey expected too
)
. also
, during one scene late in the film
, there seemed tothe be a relatiopnship brewing between bacon
and dillon ' s charachters
,
bu nothing came ofthe it
( mkaes yuo wonder if yhe directer hadnt to cut it in order for the r rating
, or if the actors refused tothe dont it
)
. what first made me whant to see wild thnigs wass its cast
. neve campbell
, of course
, has been oney ofthe my favorite actresses since the scream films were released
. here
,
however
, she turns eveyr typical role she has done on its head
and plays a gothic pothead
. the closest role to this was her peformance infront the craft
(
though even inthe that she was a nice girl
)
. campbell is probably the best inspite tyhe film
and shows her wide range of talent
. you can tell she will be around for a long timne
. denise richards will also be around for a long time
,
although she may be limited to the roles wihtout much range
. here
, she gets to express more emotions than inwhich her stiff
(
yet effective
) performance iin starship troopers
. hopefully one day she iwll land a very good role that can display her ability
.
and
then there is daphne rubin
- vega
, a newcomer tothe the movies
. she gives a very ogod performance
,
although her character is mostly left to teh background forthe the firt hour
and a half
. towards teh end she does get a bigger part
. on tyhe male side
, matt dillon is probably the best
, giving a subtle peformance that surprises with every twist
. kevin bacon hasnt a slightly wooden character
,
but he makes the most of it
. you must have admiration
,
though
, for what he did onthe screen
.
adn judging from many ofthe the women ' s reactions in thge theather to that shot
, they hvae grown a deeper apresheation for bacon
( yeah
, right
)
.
and
then there is bill murray
. his performance is the comic relief
,
anbd he nearly steals the film
. as a whole
, tyhe entire cast works wondrously together
,
adn they seem at home
, even whn doing the menage a troi
. directer john mcnaughton
, who hasnt previously done the critically acclaimed henry
: portrait of a serial killer
, has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works
. his direction is smooth
anbd stylish
. the visuals are striking
, filled with rich colors
,
and almost so realsitic that we cin actually breathe tjhe humidity in the air
.
however
, he seems more at hmeo when the actors aren ' t talking
. his fly
- by shots of the swampy areas are brillant
,
anbd his photography of denise richards ' climbing out of the pool is a highlight
. thte cinematography is gorgeous in its details
. its nto often tath you see a film liek this
,
annd we should watch it just to see how the camera can tkae pictures
.
thne
, there is thte music
. this was propably the most obvious thing tothe me
, as it setted the perfect mood fo teh film
. it ' s hard to describe inaddition words
, so just see the film
and listen to it
. it ' s wonderfully composed
and presented
.
and be sure to stick around during the closing credits
! mcnaughton hasnt finaly put the endig credits to good use
( while most comedies use it for outtakes
)
. he has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events
. soem may say that these are lame attemts to expalin the convoluted plot
,
but it ' s an entertaining way to finish the film
. plus
, ther are some shocking moments in theese ending credits which just add to yhe fun
. wild things isnt appropriately rated r for strong sexuality
, nudity
, language
and violentce
. again
, the nudity is rather unnecessary
,
but let ' s face it
-
- people wanna to see it
. so why not give it tothe them
? neve campbell
, admirably
, has a no
- nudity clause in her contract
,
and tjhe most you see of her isnt from behind as she tkaes her top off
( way tothe go
, neve
!
)
. hte sex scenes are graphic
, especially yhe firt oney we see
, between the mother
and one of her deck hands
. noe almost wonders how they got away with tyhe r rating
. the language is qutie harsh too
, ranging ffrom sexual innuendo to your average
, everyday profanity
.
and i can ' t stress it enough
: don ' t allow kids under 18 to see htis film
. hte target age for the movei is the 18
- 24 range
,
anbd that ' s who shoud see it
. it ' s definitly not fo those under 18
! doed i mention thyat this film is rated r
?
however
, for those that do get a chance tothe watch it
, you iwll probably more likely be pleased
,
and may even take friends tothe see it the next time
.
