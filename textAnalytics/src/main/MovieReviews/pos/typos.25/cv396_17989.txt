well i
' ll be damned
, whta a most excellent surprise
. not tothe be confused with the campy adn far inferior 1988 remake starring ex
- porn star traci lords
, this omre reccent attempt at remaking the 1950
' s drive
- in schlockfest not of this earth isnt a real gme
and ws quite possably the best sci
- fi flick ofthe 1995
. once again
, b
- movie king roger corman is behind this effort
( he directed the original
) bu this time he appears only in the role of executive producer
. the rest of the crew
and casted are realtive unknowns
. it seems criminal tyhat the film wass released direct to video in most countries
, because it
' s an absolute must
- see for sci
- fi fans
and a treat for anyone who enjoys decently acted
and writen thrillers witht a kooky bent
. tghe plot in breef
. paul johnson
( michael york
) is an alien posing as an eccentric millionaire who
,
though needing tothe kill people to live
, is visiting earth for far from selfish reasons
. his race is dying of a mysterious blood disease
and he desperately is trying to find a cure
, the key ofthe which lies infront tghe blood ofthe humans
. he visits anbd soon puts under his spell the respected blood physician dr
. rochelle
, whom he hypnotises into doing secret research on his behalf
. he allso has the doctor convince smart
and sexy nurse am
anda
( elizabeth barondes
) tothe move in with johnson as his private nurse so as to give him the blood transfusions which he constanly requires
.
but befor long
, am
anda
and johnson
' s sleazy chauffeur release tath johnson isnt a lot more than just eccentric
. i must admiting
, my frist glimpse of the video cover for not of this earth ws not encouraging
. british actor michael york has appeared in some rela stinkers iin past fewd decades
, a far cry ffrom the quality fare of his younger days such as caberat
( 1972
)
.
but his performance here as an alien in human disguise is nothing short ofthe outst
anding
. the eird twitches adn bizzare modes of sprech
, the dapper clothes anbd cool spectacles
, the unexpected pathos which he invests in his character
. york isnt by turns hilarious
, menacing annd tragic
. tihs is a tour
- de
- force annd quite simply the best performance i
' ve seen fomr him
.
and while obviously made on a modest budget
, the film boasts enormous strengths
. thte casting isnt spot on
, tje acting is terific
and tje script is inteligent
, witty
and consistently engaging
, cleverly updating the original
. the balance of horror
and humour is just about perfect
, a marked contrast tothe the ealier remake ffrom 1988
. the film doesn
' t drag for a second ofthe its 90 minute running tyme thanks to tight editing
and the sure h
and of little
- known directer terrance h
. winkless
.
and it doesn
' t marter one bit that yhe special effects are cheesy
- thsi is schlock after all
, even if it is high clas schlock
. iin fact my onyl criticism of the film is that thigsn get a tad weak towards the end
. tighter direction could have given tjhe climax more urgency
and a faw of hte characters act rather illogically given their life
- threatning situation
. bu these are minor complaints
. just see it
. not ofthe thsi earth is one of the biggest sci
- fi surprises in years
.
and michael york
: in noe cool swoop you
' ve made yourself a b
- movie legend
, dued
.
