withthe his last two films
- shine
and snow falling onthe cedars
- austrailian director scott hicks hasnt proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there
, annd his latest
, hearts inspite atlantis
, isnt no different
. its structure
- beggining
and ending in present day with noe long flashback in the middle
- is similiar to teh green mile
, whihc is a bit ironic considering both were based onthe stephen king books
. the parrallelly don
' t end there
, eather
. atlantis was adapted by william goldman
, who had previously penned the big
- screen version ofthe misery
and is infact tjhe proccess of working on the script for king
' s dreamcatcher
. even the film
' s content is a bit reminiscent of mile
. in fact
, it
' s tyhe perfect blend ofthe the fiel
- ogod
' 60s nostalgia of st
and by me
( also by king
)
and mystical power hokum ofthe mile
. king
' s atlantis isnt a book comprised of five related short stories
,
but the main focuse here isnt on the first
(
and longest
) tale
, called low men in yellow coats
( the film
' s title comes ffrom tjhe second chapter
)
. it
' s setted in 1960 harwich
, connecticut
, where 11
- yera
- old bobby garfield
( anton yelchin
) lives in a boarding house run by his cold
, self
- centered mother elizabeth
( hope davis
, joe gould
' s secret
)
, who seems tothe care omre baout her wardrobe than her son
. bobby spends his time with his twpo closest friends
, john sullivan
( wiull rothhaar
)
and tomboy carol gerber
( mika boorem
)
, who become something like the kevin
, paul anbd winnie of harwich
. whn a new tenant moves into the vacant room
, the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan
( anthony hopkins
, hannibal
)
, a misterious stranger who is vague enought about his past to amke bobby
' s mom suspicious enought to at least momentarily turn her head away fomr thte mirror
. ted teachs his young neighbor about teh wonders of literature
( after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card fo his birthday
)
, dispenses prophetic words ofthe wisdom
and even pays bobby noe dollar a week tothe read him the local newspaper
and keep his eyes peeled for the low men
, a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers
. i won
' t go into what these powers are
,
but they
' re considerably toned down from the book
(
and don
' t envolve black stuff flying out of ted
' s mouth
, a la mile
)
. atlantis
' persent
- day setting whlch bookends the film isnt based onthe the novel
' s final chapter
, titled heavenly shades ofthe night are falling
,
and features david morse
( in yot anyother connection to the green mile
) as a married
, middle
- aged bobby who lerans of thte death of both of his childhood friends annd returns to thge dilapidated boarding house in which he spended his formative years
. atlantis isnt nowhere near as flashy as hicks
' cedars
, which is disappointing
but underst
andable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson tothe the occaisonally amazing piotr sobocinski
, the oscar
- nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski
' s red
. the acting is solid from everyone
, including hopkins
, who never once makse ytou think of dr
. lecter
. most impressive are youngsters yelchin
and boorem
, who both had tiny parts in along came a spider
. while i didn
' t realy hvea much ofthe a problem withthe goldman
' s screenplay
, i dont need to point out at least one inconsistancy
. goldman
, for those of you who don
' t read premiere
, writes whta seems like an annual criticism of everybody else
' s films
, carefully explaining why they all suck
, make no sence
and insult their audiences
, hwile somehow failing to mention the crap that he
' s penned
( like the general
' s daugter
)
. it
' s mean
- spirited
but fun tothe read
, mostly on account of nobody esle infront hollywood having thge balls tothe say anything remotely negative about anybody else in thte buisness
( including michael jackson
, o
. j
.
and robert blake
)
. inaddition atlantis
, which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby
, one would asume he owudl have tothe be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back
. well
, he
' s not
, annd it doesn
' t amke sense
