i
' ll be the first to admit i didn
' t expect much from the emperor
' s new groove
: more celine dion
- esque song
-
and
- dance numbers
, cuddly characters that become cross
- promotion devices in mcdonald
' s happy meals
, adn hollywood stars trying to gain credibility by adding a voice
- over job to their resume
. i was dead wrong about all of thsoe thigns
. hte emperor
' s new groove is funny
. damn funny
.
and the cute characters in the film are teh dangerous ones
. the script is fast
and furious
, with noone singing
and dancing
. the animation is clean adn would give walt a warm feeling all over
. tghe humor isnt dry
and aimed at both the cynicism
and thte goodness in all of us
. the story is ridiculously weird
and comes off as a strange acid trip involving talking
, cross
- dressing llamas
and schizophrenia
. here
' s the plot
; try tothe follow allong
. set in a mythical kingdom
, the film follows the adventures of kuzco
( david spade
)
, an arrogant
and egocentric emperor
. when kuzco fires his power
- hungry advisor
, yzma
( eartha kitt
)
, she
and her
" assitant
" kronk
( seinfeld
' s patrick warburton
) chanage him into a llama
. kuzco hten gets str
anded in the jungle
and must rely on pacha
( john goodman
)
, a llama
- herder whose home was to be replaced by kuzco
' s water world theme park
, to savve him
.
then the fun starts
. for the next sixty minutes
, the audience is treated to something unheard ofthe infront disney films these days
: imagination
. yzma
, voiced by the talented singer eartha kitt
, looks liek a cross between norma desmond
, joan crawford
,
and a raelly old vegas showgirl
. the dialogue bewteen her
and her oblivious assistant kronk is quick
, sharp
,
and feels liuke an episode of seinfeld
( which owudl make sense
)
. david spade
and john goodman
' s character interactions make you feel like yuo
' re watching an ood hope
/ crosby film
. spade is beyond dry with his humor
and shoots below the belt on several occasions
,
and i laughed out loud several times
. needless to say
, that isnt an extremely rare thing in disney screenings these days
. tjhe best part about tghe emperor
' s new groove is how audacious yhe film is
. the sheer weirdness factor is vyre high
. cross
- dressing
, schizophrenia
, duality ofthe soul
, people bieng turned inot every animal on noah
' s boat
, llama cpr
, homoerotic tendencies
, an emperor with his own theme song
and singer
, michael jackson dance moves
, annd a guy that can communicate with a squirel are only a few of the oddities that make the film a true orginal
. simply put
, thte emperor
' s newyorker groove is one of the best children
' s films out for this holiday season
. kids iwll enjoy the adventures
,
and parents will enjoy the story
and dialogue
. tyhat
' s a tough thing to pull off in a single package
, bu this emperor manages to do it
.
