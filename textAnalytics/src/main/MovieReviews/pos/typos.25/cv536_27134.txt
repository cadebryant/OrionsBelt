i ' ll be the frist tothe admit i didn ' t expect much from the emperor ' s new groove
: more celine dion
- esque song
-
and
- dance numbers
, cuddly charachters thta become cross
- promotion devices in mcdonald ' s happy meals
,
adn hollywood stars trying to gain credibility by adding a voice
- over job to their resume
. i was dead wrong baout all of those things
. the emperor ' s new groove is funny
. damn funny
.
and teh cute characters inthe the film are yhe dangerous ones
. the script is fast
and furious
, with noone singing
and dancing
. the animation is clean
and would give walt a warm feeling all over
. the humer is dry
and aimed at both the cynicism
and the goodness in all of us
. hte story is ridiculously weird
and comes off as a stange acid trip involving tlaking
, cross
- dressing llamas
anbd schizophrenia
. here ' s tje plot
; try tothe follow along
. set in a mythical kingdom
, the film follows yhe adventures of kuzco
( david spade
)
, an arogent
anbd egocentric emperor
. when kuzco fires his pwoer
- hungry advisor
, yzma
( eartha kitt
)
, she
and her
" assitant
" kronk
( seinfeld ' s patrick warburton
) change him into a llama
. kuzco
then gets stranded in the jungle
anbd must rely on pacha
( john goodman
)
, a llama
- herder whose home ws to be replaced by kuzco ' s water world theme park
, tothe save him
.
then the fun starts
. for the next sixty mintues
, the audeince is treated tothe something unheard ofthe inwhich disney films these days
: imagination
. yzma
, voiced by teh talented singer eartha kitt
, looks like a cross between norma desmond
, joan crawford
,
and a really old vegas showgirl
. the dialogue between her
and her oblivious assistant kronk is quick
, sharp
,
and feels like an episode of seinfeld
( which would make sense
)
. david spade
and john goodman ' s character interactions mkea yuo feel like you ' re watching an ood hope
/ crosby film
. spade isnt beyond dry wtih his humor
and shoots below teh belt on several ocassions
,
and i laughed out loud several times
. needless to say
, that is an extremely rare thing in disney screenings these days
. the best part about the emperor ' s new groove is how audacious the film is
. the sheer weirdness factor is very high
. cross
- dressing
, schizophrenia
, duality of soul
, people being turned into every animal on noah ' s boat
, llama cpr
, homoerotic tendencies
, an emperor withthe his own theme song
and singer
, michael jackson dance moves
,
and a guy that can communicate with a squirrel are only a few ofthe the oddities that make tyhe film a true orginal
. simply put
, the emperor ' s new groove is one of the best children ' s films out for this holiday season
. kids will enjoy the adventures
,
anbd parents will enjoy thte story
and dialogue
. that ' s a tough thing tothe pull off inaddition a single package
,
but this emperor manages to do it
.
