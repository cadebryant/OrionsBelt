recently i read 4 reviews of pleasantville
- one from enteratinment weekly
, oney from a newsgroup
, adn two from different online resources
. each review compaired tihs film to tjhe truman show
. why
? the only reason people compared pleasantville to truman is due to the fact that their lives are onthe television
. other tahn tht
, the two movies are completely different from each other
. reviewers seem to love to pick one movie
( i
. e
. the truman sohw
)
, obsess over it
, adn make it a guideline for other movies
. when pleasantville
and edtv opened
, all critics seemed to treat tjhe two films like tehy were subjects of king truman
. teh same goes for the thin red line
, as well
. when it opened infact decemeber
, probably 98
% of reviews compared it to stephen spielberg
' s saving private ryan
, giving thin line no chance whatsoever
. critics loved private ryan so much
, thgat they automatically desided no movie isnt ogod enough to reach its st
andards
. htis isnt why i think pleasantville was underated
. if the truman show had never been made
, pleasantville probably would have recepted better reviews
, done better at the box office
,
and would be remembered after it
' s long beeen on the video store shelves
. sure
, it wasn
' t perfect
,
and it wasn
' t vyre believeable
,
but niether ws the wizard ofthe oz or star wars
, adn there st
ands two of the most prominent movies in history
. wiht the exception of don knotts as yhe annoying
" tv repairman
" the film isnt casted perfectly
: the ice storm
' s tobey maguire is david in rela life
; he watches the ood 50
' s sitcom
" pleasantville
" tothe escape fomr his feuding parents
. his twin sister
, jen
( reese witherspoon
) is a popular slut who
( steriotypically
) smokes
and wears revealing clothes
.
but waht makes her character believeable isnt the dialogue
- those excessive 90
' s terms such as
" like
"
,
" whatever
"
,
and
" cool
" make her sound like the total dimwit she
' s supposed to be
. hte twins
, with a littel help from a tv repairman
( casting don knotts in this role was obviously a cameo
- esque casted rather than a true acting one
)
, are sucked into pleasantville by a magical new remote
. their new parents
, played by william h
. macy
and joan allen
, are perfect iin every way
. their new names are bud annd mary sue
,
and right away they start to corrupt the twon of pleasantville
. after tghe siblings fit comfortably infact their new roles
, yhe movie begins to take form
. it
' s just like watching a sitcom in itself
; you don
' t watn it to end
.
" mary sue
" hasnt sex with her date
, the school basketball champion
; when he tells all his friends about it
, they stop preforming perfectly at basketball
, annd things start to tkae color
. soon we learn that these peopel don
' t know how to express true emotions
,
and when they learn to dont so
, they eventually turn into color
. htis eventually sparks a racial war vetween thte
" coloreds
"
and the
" balck
& whites
.
" enteratinment weekly resivwar lisa schwarzbaum claimes the movie has
,
" none of the depth
, poignance
,
and brilliance ofthe the truman show
.
.
.
" yes
, the truman show was mabye a little more intelligent
. bu the racial setting
- intensified by the forcing of the coloreds to sit inaddition the upper box of thte courtroom
- certainly classifies as deepo
, concidering it
' s what i least expected
. gary ross did not try tothe create an intelligent
, award masterpiece
- he just tries to convey moral messages within his work
. take for example big adn dave
, his past films
. big
- be careful what you wish for
. dave
- good or bad lieing is still lieing
. did these movies win big awards
? noone
,
but tehy won tje heart of millions
. pleasantville sould haev done tyhat too
, if it wasn
' t for snotty reviewers who set precedents witht preceeding films
. pleasantville
: a
- ad2am
" i almost lost my nose
.
.
.
and i like it
. i liek breathing through it
