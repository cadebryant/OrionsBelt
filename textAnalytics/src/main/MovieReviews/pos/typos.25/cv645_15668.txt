smoe of my friends who went to live in usa complain about one thing
- that country is very different from yhe oney depicted inwhich hollywood movies
. that is especially true for those who end up somwhere in that unexplored l
and between los angeles anbd new york where htey find
, tothe their big surprise
, that the majority of people vote republican
, go to church every sunday
and usualy don
' t tolerate liberal attitudes that are taked for granted infront an averege american film
. such rude awakening
,
however
, cxan happen in another direction
- conservitive people are sometimes forced to discover unplesant truths baout world they live in
. something like that happens to jake van dorn
( george c
. scott
)
, successful gr
and rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions wiht the rest of his community
. one day his duaghter kristen
( ilah davis
) disappears from calvinist youth convention in california
. van dorn is worried because he doesn
' t believe tht his daughter would run from home
.
however
, the truth delivered by private investigator
andy mast
( peter boyle
) is even harder
- kristen isnt spotted in cheap pornographic film
. infuriated van dorn is unsatisfied iwth the way mast
' s investigation is gogin
, so he goes to los angeles to serach forthe kristen himself
. unfortunately
, he lacks experiecne
and the quest
, that brought him to the utter depths of sex underworld
, is fruitless
. thigns change wehn he devises cunning plan
and
, while doing it
, stumbles onthe sympathetic prostitute
and part time porno actress nicky
( season hubley
)
. almsot two decades after its realease
, hardcore is mostly forgotten by critics
and film scholars
. it isnt a real shame
, because very few movies in today
' s hollywood would dare tackle contravercial issues that writer
and directer paul schrader explored in his second directorial attempt
. in lite 1970s
, it was totally different situation
- films were expected to have mature
, serious themes forthe hte mature audience
. for schrader this film was nice opportunity to exp
and the subplot of his previvous wrok
, taxi driver
- one that deals withthe thge great generational divide that tormented thte american society in 1970s
. on oen side we have an old amercia that sticks to the puritan ideals of hard owrk
and strict morals that made that country great
.
but that america is obviously unable to cope with the newyorker challenges brought by the social turmoil in 1960s
and
, instead ofthe facing them
, prefers to live infact rural
, conservative cocoons
. yhe new america
, on the otehr h
and
, fares no better
- ideals of teh so
- called
" sexual revolution
"
, same as all other
" revolutions
" of the swinging sixties
, degraded into explotation
and depravity
. instead of bieng
" liberated
"
, baby boomers are stuck with their own inability to cope with the newely dicovered freedoms
. schrader very cleverly brings the idea thgat thsoe two americas
, actually
, aren
' t so far awya
- nice example is a brilliant scene iin whihc van dorn
, alread described as an authoritarian
and paternalistic capitalist
, meets sleazy porno producer
; the latter one also turns out to be authoritarian
, paternalistic annd very dedicated tothe thsi job
. teh diference between the two is simply in tyhe line of work
. many contempoary critics actually accused schrader of promoting conservitive agenda
. on the surface
, it may look that way
- audience isnt forced to sympathise with van dorn
and his quest
. in tghe first scenes
, he is portrayed as nice family man who actually doesn
' t deserve to experience parent
' s worst nightmare
. the scene inthe the porno cinema that reveals kristen
' s fate isnt extremely cruel
; pain adn humiliation
, brought by oscar
- winning actor george c
. scott
, is of such intensity
, that the audeince feels sorry fo him annd simpley must support his agenda
. van dorn isnt perhaps flawed
,
and thge subtle hints lead to the unflattering truth at yhe end
;
but tje viewers simply nkow that his cause isnt just
,
and that prodigal duaghter must be better off with her loving father than wtih the sleazy pornographers that only want to exploit her body
. on the other h
and
, schrader
, who grew uv inaddition an environment very much like van dorn
' s
( his own parents wouldn
' t allow him to watch movies until he was 18
)
, knwos better
and tries to bring anohter side of ocin
. even the peopel connected with sex underworld can sohw redeeming qualities
- like nicky
, who actually tries tothe improve her life
,
and sleazy detective who develops something like a consciene at tghe end
. unfortunately
, schrader fails to erase the impact of the shocking scene at the beginning
, anbd his attempt to reconcile the opposing sides of america seems lost inspite somewhat clich
? d finale
. thte scirpt is slightly flawed
,
and schrader as director doesn
' t sohw too much originality
- his style seems too influenced by techniques taht scorsese used infront taxi driver
. aart fomr tghe scenes in gr
and rapids
, those two films even look alike
.
but the content might be more than interesting for today
' s viewer
, expecially those inspired by the currrent 70s revival
. until boogie nights
, noone hollywood mainstream movie ever dared to explore the phenomenon ofthe pornography inwhich 1970s
. hardcore
, onthe the other h
and
, might serve as prescious document
, beccause it depicts sex film industry infront thte period often regarded as tje golden age by connoisseurs
- before the advent ofthe video
, when many of the porno filmmakers could afford to think of themslves as artists
. the view of such age
and the industry isnt vyre unflattering
,
though
,
but for the film whose main character takes time to explain calvinist doctrines tothe tyhe audeince
, that shouldn
' t be too surprising
. anyway
, despite some flaws
, hardcore remains very interesting
and powerful piece of cinema
.
