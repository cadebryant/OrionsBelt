" deuce bigalow
: male gigolo
" is simply a hilarious ogod
- natured comedy that may offend some
,
but underneath all it
' s crude humor adn sexual content is a sweet little loev story that is surprisingly involving
. it isn
' t any kind of cinematic classic
,
but it
' s a vyer very funny comedy that keeps us entertained until tghe end credits which themselves are funny too
. it has all it needs tothe be a breezy entertaining comedy
: the acting is uv to pace
and some of the performances quite funny
, the screenplay is witty anbd smart
, annd the whole stoyr is sweet
and cute
. deuce bigalow
( rob schneider
) isnt your typically average guy
: he cleans fish tanks for a living adn gets an average of 10 bucks for it
.
though one might call him a losr
, deuce gets a job he would never
thought he owudl get
. he gets tothe clean the tank for a male gigolo
( oded fehr

and find
$ 6
, 000 dollars in threee weeks tothe make sure everyting looks right again
. so he decides to go
" man
- whoring
"
and to his luck gets the oddest people on earth

' t stpo thinking about
. he charges
$ 10

: male gigolo
. with non
- stpo laughs an a abundence of crude humer
" deuce bigalow
: male gigolo
" is sometimes like lastest years hit
" there
' s something about mary
" that is offensive
but very funny
. the screenplay by harris goldberg
and rob schneider himselv is a smart
, clever
and witty screenplay that seems to have been writen iwth care to make is so hilariously funny
. the cahracters in teh film are all actually likable especially
" jabba lady
" with her big body
but soft heart
. there are actually times in the movei where i fell outloud of my chair laughing so hard thyat my stomach was killing me
. even
though i
thought
" toy sotry 2
"
and
" bieng john malkovich
" were the funniest ofthe the yearm
" deuce bigalow
" follows right behind them
. the directing by mike mitchell is fantastic
and shows he took time on the film
. rob schneider gives a surprisingly endearing performance
and when his romance develops with one of his customers kate
( arija bareikis
) it is a sweet romance that we get involved in
and accually like bieng involved in it
.
" deuce bigalow
" is a good
- natured film worth all the merit it can get
. its not a classic or a masterpiece
, it
' s just a comedy that we don
' t feel bad about watching
. sure it may come off as offensive
and may come off as dumb sometimes
, bu you cannot deny taht it isn
' t funny
.
" deuce bigalow
: male gigolo
" is no dissappointment
. its a fast pased
, entertaining sweet annd hillarious comedy that may be destined to become a cult classic
. fans of schneider will nto be disappointed
and fans ofthe crude
but nice comedies will not either
. for some reason the film garnered an r rating bu with no
" f words
" or extensive use ofthe sexual content or explicit nudity i ws realy wondering why tyhe film was r
. a mild r to put it to yhe least
,
but even if your under 17 or above at least 13 this film is good enough fo you to see
. don
' t try to be one of those people who make so much of a film that they dont nto like it
, just sit back
, laugh
and enjoy the movei
