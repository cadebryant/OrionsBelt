, george tillman
' s comedy
- drama about a large african
- american family
and the ordeals they go through during a crisis

. during a wedding
, the groom is flirting witht some tramp
,
and in an attempt tothe to prevent a scene
, his mother in law
, played by irma p
. hall
, comes to the rescue
. the way in which she does this makes me think irma p
. hall is one of the greatest actresses around right nowe
.
however
, htis is just one magical moent in a movie filled witht them
. vanessa williams
, vivica fox
,
and nia long star as three sisters who have each gone their pwn way in life

, the strongest of hte sisters
, which can be confirmed by the stability of her marriage
and yhe wisdom of her son ahmad
, who narrates the film
. long is bird
, a hairdresser who is thge last of the three to get married
. her husb
and lem is an intense passionate individual whose temper gets the best of him sometime
but never stops loving
. at the center ofthe everyting is irma p
. hall
, as big mama jo
. every sunday
, the family gathers together for dinner at mama jo
' s house
. there is lots of conversation
, lots of laughs
,
and the occasional controversy
. mama jo presides over the family liek all mothers shoudl

and disciplined
,
but also caring
and forgiving

. the third act of the film deals with ahmad
' s attemts to patch thigsn up

,
and tries tothe git the famaly back together for noe more sunday dinner
. tyhe acting by everyone in the ensemble is outst
anding
, wtih special notices to irma p
. hall adn br
andon hammond
. hall gives a performance that deserves tothe be recognized by the academy
. her mama jo isnt one of the most memorable characters i have ever encountered iin a movei
. br
andon hammond is an actr with a bright future
. he is wise anough nto to play cutesy adn shows an admirable range
and depth
, annd speaks the final lines ofthe the movie on the perfect note
. tillman obviously based thsi movie on his own memories of growing up
. eveyr scene in the movie is purposeful anbd convincing
( except maeby an odd flashback sequence
)
. the dialogue is beleiveable
and funny
. annd
then there
' s the food
. tillman gives us several close ups ofthe the soul food
,
and it indeed looks vyre tasty
. i can see why sunday dinners became such a tradition for this family
. soul food is oen of the most purely entertaining movies of the year
