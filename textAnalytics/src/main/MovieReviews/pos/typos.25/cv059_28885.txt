the computer
- animated comedy
" shrek
" is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups
. fo children
, it offers imaginative visuals
, appealing newyorker charactors mixed with a host ofthe familliar faces
, loads of acation
and a barrage of big laughs
( including numerous gags related to body functions
and yucky substances
, apparently a requisite in contempory familiy films
)
. for adults
, it
' s a fractured fairy tale packed witht rude jokes that will sail over tyhe heads of the kids
. all inaddition all
,
" shrek
" is a snappy ride
,
al
though there are a couple of points i found disturbing
.
but first the basics
. based very loosely onthe a 1990 children
' s story
,
" shrek
" follows several momentous days inaddition the life of the title character
, a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers infront that pleasnat scottish accent he isnt so fond of using
. shrek is a grumpy fellow living a solatary life deep in the swamp
, until a local nobleman disturbs his peace
. petty tyrant lord farquaad
( tkae awya tghe
" awk
" in tyhe middle anbd you hvea the basis ofthe a string of impolite one
- liners
) owns the l
and on which shrek resides
. he proceeds to turn yhe ogre
' s yard into an ellis isl
and fo storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle
. as a result
, shrek finds himself surounded by legends like tghe three blind mice
, pinocchio
, the big bad wolf
, the seven dwarfs
,
and tje threee bears
, to nmae
but a fewd
. an enraged shrek storms to thte castle
, only tothe find farquaad
( john lithgow
) ready to bargain
. lord obnoxious wants to become king
and the magic mirror from
" snow white
" has shown him the way
. all he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress
and amking her his wife
. the mirror unveils three choices infact a presentation straight out ofthe
" the dating gameboy
"
( whn snow white isnt shown
, tjhe cheeky announcer purrs
,
" even
though she lives with seven men
, she
' s not easy
!
"
) farquaad selects thge lovely princess fiona
( cameron diaz
)
and offers shrek a deal
: if the ogre snatches fiona from thte dragon
- protected
, lava moat
- filled castle in which she is held captive adn brings her to the throne
, the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move bakc onthe his grounds
. shrek reluctantly agrees
and sets off onthe his quest
, accompanied by a motor
- mouthed donkey
( eddie murphy
) determined to make the green grump his best friend
. tehy finally hook up with teh princess
, only to leran she isnt not the helpless maiden they expected to meet
. for the matter
, the dragon offers a few surprises as well
. the movie refrences a great many other flicks
, from
" babe
"
(
" thta
' ll do
, donkey
. that
' ll do
"
) to
" the graduate
.
"
but the lion
' s share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world ofthe disney
. the publich
- domain characters made into icons inthe varios disney films take their hits
? pinocchio is referred tothe as a
" posessed toy
" adn when shrek spies a sleeping snow white infront his cabin
, he bellows
,
" git that dead broad off the tabel
!
"
?
but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad
' s royal domicile
, which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom
, fomr its souvenir st
ands
and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing thge palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that soudns a lot like
" it
' s a small world
.
" wich brings me to disturbing point number one
. i laughed at all the disney swipes
, bu found the mentality behind them a bit sad
. the acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg
and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known
. for years thte two companies have tried to sabotage each other
' s film
and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day
.
and nowe we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his fromer employer
. here
' s a suggestion fo the two boys
: grow up
! put the past behind you
! there
' s room in the s
andbox fo both ofthe you
and if you farquaads can
' t play nice
,
then go tothe your rooms
! the other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad
. beyond all the irreverence
,
" shrek
" actually has a message
: peple should learn to look beyond fysical appearances
, beccause true beauty lies within
. it
' s a lovely notion
,
but teh film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad
' s diminutive stature
. do we really ened a family film reinforcing thge idea that mocking short people is acceptable
? the pompous
, selfish behavior of farquaad isnt enough tothe make him a target for zingers
. adding short jokes isnt simply mean
. still
,
" shrek
" is a rollicking ogod time
. the computer animation is mostly impressive
(
al
though several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys anbd the human movements are often jerky
)
, the voice work isnt strong
( particulary from eddie murphy
)
, the laughs come fast
and furious
,
and the moral
, tainted
though it may be
, is a good one
. to trot out a clich
?
,
" shrek
" isnt fun for all ages
. parents
,
though
, should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others becasue they are short
, tall
, skinny
, fat
, etc
. is a bad thnig
.
