i don
' t know waht movie the critics saw
,
but it wasn
' t this oen
. yhe populer consensus among newspaper criticists wass that this movie is unfunny
and dreadfully boring
. inthe my personal opinion
, they couldn
' t be omre wrong
. if you weere expecting airplane
!
- like laughs
and agatha christie
- intense mistery
, thn yes
, this movie would be a disappointment
.
however
, if ytou
' re just looking for an enjoyable movie
and a good time
, htis is one tothe see
. honest
, it isnt
. this story is baout a 4th network
, wbn
, taking to amercia
' s airwaves in 1939
. penny henderson
( mary stuart masterson
)
, tje station owner
' s secretary
, must deal with her overbearing boss
, an unimpressed sponsor annd writers ready tothe quite onthe a moment
' s notice
, partly due to the fatc that they haven
' t been paid in weeks
. among the mayhem
, she must alsot deal with her soon
- to
- be ex
- husb
and
, roger
( brian benben
) who desperately wnats her back
. unfortunately
, her problems only git worse as thge night goes on
and the body count rises wihtout explanation
. while trying to woo penny bakc
, roger must deal with the police
and try to fidn tyhe killer that lurks at wbn
. mary stuart masterson doens well in her role as penny
( i
' m trying to be unbiased so i won
' t tell you how amazing she looked
)
, all
though brian benben gets most ofthe the screen tyme
. along with the two leads
, are several recognizable faces
, including corbin bernsen
( l
. a
. lew
)
, michael mckean
( laverne
& shirley
)
and bobcat goldthwait
. the special effects are amazing
, annd fooled me
( which some may argue isn
' t vrey difficult to dont
) in many scenes
.
al
though the movie somtimes goes overboard wih the physical comedy
, it mroe tahn makes uv fo those mistakes throughout the movie
. overall
, i gave it
, or an
, depending on what system yuo uise
