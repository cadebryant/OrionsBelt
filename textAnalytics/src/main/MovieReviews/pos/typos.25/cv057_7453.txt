i hadnt been expecting more ofthe this movei than the less than thrilling twister
. twister was good
but had no real plot
and no one to simpithize wtih
.
bu twister had amazing effects
and i was hoping so would volcano volcano starts with tommy lee jones at emo
. he worrys about a small earthquake enough tothe leave his daughter at hmeo with a baby sitter
. there is one small quake
then another quake
.
then a geologist points out to tommy that its takes a geologic event to heat millions of gallons of water infact 12 hours
. a few hours later large ammount of ash strat to fall
.
thne
.
.
.
. it starts
. the volcanic eruption
.
.
.
. i liked thsi movie
.
.
.
bu it was not as great as i hoped
. i ws still ogod none the less
. it had excelent special effects
. the best veiw
.
.
. thte helecopters flying over the streets ofthe volcanos
. also
.
.
. there weere interesting side stories that made the plot more interesting
. so
.
.
. it was good
