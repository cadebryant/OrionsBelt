. spoon isnt an idea for a character at best as written by hall
, bu shakur displays an intelligence annd survival instinct whihc struggle with his addiction
. mostly it comes through those eyes
, eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from yhe infamous gangsta
. it is spoon who plays conscience to stretch
