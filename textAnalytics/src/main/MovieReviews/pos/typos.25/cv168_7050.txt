larry flynt is a self proclaimed smut pedlar annd the owner
/ publisher of the multi
- million dollar hustler publications company
. the people vs
. larry flynt is tghe story of larry flynt
' s fight for teh freedom to circulate
and sell his pornographic magazine
, hustler
. based on a true stoyr
, the film isnt almost a documentary inwhich that it
' s a very vivid
and detailled look at larrry flynt
' s life
. woody harrelson gives an excellent performance
. he conveys flynt
' s peculiarities
and his charcter wiht depth
and focuse
. by the end of the film the audiance actually finds themselves
, somewhat grudgingly
, liking larry flynt
. htis isnt some feat given flynt
' s apparent lack of any morals or ethics
and his extremely smutty adn childish behaviour infact cout
.
however
, flynt has a number ofthe things going for him
, he
' s rich
, he
' s funny
,
and most importantly
, he says exactly what he means
. larry flynt
' s wief
, althea leasure is played by courtney love
. larry meets althea at one of his clubs
, adn they fall in love
( a very sexual
and ope loev
)
. both of them indulge in a world of too much sex
,
and eventually too much drugs
. flynt hadnt beeen tkaing an eccessive ammount of pain killers after being paralysed from the waist down
( which ws especially upsetting for him
) by an assassin
. althea had joined him in taking the drugs
. following an opperation flynt decides tothe stop taking drugs
, althea does not have any such plans
, nor the determination to follow them
. as the film progresses we see her become increasingly frail
and sick
. courtney lvoe obviously has a great underst
anding for althea
' s situation
, as she is brilliant inthe portraing althea in every respect
. it
' s extremely sad to watch althea literally wather away
. edward norton plays flynt
' s lawyer
, alan isaacman
. again
, this is a solid performance
. the audience finds it eazy to sympathise wiht isaacman who somehow puts up with flynt
' s courtroom antics
. flynt is not only childish in the courtroom
, bu downright rude tothe the judges
,
and l
ands himself in a lot of trouble
(
and even in a mental insitution
) because of it
. isaacman is very easy to like
,
and graet at proving
( in qtuie clever ways
) his points to the court
. milos forman hasnt done a great job in directing thte people vs
. larry flynt
. it is nto really an exciting or thrilling film
,
but instead a highly interesting portrayal of a true story
. due to larry
' s character it is also
, at times
, a very funny film
.
however
, it is much more tahn that
. it is about tjhe fight for freedom of speech
, anti
- censorship
, anbd yhe right to be able choose forthe oneself waht to see anbd buy
. an excellent look at flynt
, his life
, adn his story
. keep a look out for the real larrry flynt who makes a cameo as judge morrissey
.
