the opening crawl tells us taht the galaxy is in turmoil over yhe taxation of trade routes
, anbd yhe greedy trade federation hasnt unsed it
' s armada of powerful space battleships tothe blockade tje planet naboo
. we soon find thyat the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots annd force naboo
' s ruler
, the young queen amidala
( natalie portman
) to sign a treaty giving the federation controll
.
however
, the galactic republic has sent jedi knights qui
- gon jinn
( liam neeson
) adn obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
) as emmisarries to thge federation in order tothe negotiate for the ending ofthe teh blockade
. no sooner dont tehy arrive thna the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a mysterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi
,
and the first battle beggins
. it seems that for me
and thous
ands of peple like me
, teh love for george lucas
' s trilogy ofthe star wars movies hasnt only grown over time
. we
' re the fans
, nto the freaks
. we won
' t go dressing up like darth vader
(
al
though you have to admit thsoe imperial uniforms are preety darn cool
)
, annd we won
' t incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations
( not all the time
, anyway
)
,
but if someone wants to challange us to a little trivia contest
, we
' re throwing down
. all right
, stpo looking at me like that
. we ahev been faithfully anbd patiently waiting
. waiting for this movie ever since the end credits ofthe return of the jedi started to roll
. you see
, tje trilogy is nto just a set of movies
,
but a religion of sorts tothe we
, the faithful disciples
,
and tje phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of tyhe messiah
. unfortunately
, it is not our savior
. for weeks beforeh
and
, i was going around telling people that htis movie had better be damned good
- stupendously ogod
- miraculously good
. anytying less
and it
' ll be the biggest dissappointment of the century
. i didn
' t want the doomsaying prophecy to cmo true
, realyl i didn
' t
,
but tihs film nevertheless fails to triarch the pinnacles of filmmaking
. carachter development is virtually nonexistent
. with the possible exception ofthe qui
- gon
, most of yhe film
' s charachters seem left with nothing to do
but go through the motions
. none seem very affected by their experiences
, adn few even sohw any passion at all
. contrast this whith tjhe horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected tothe in thte form of jar jar binks
, a creature belonging to a race which lives inaddition underwater cities on naboo
, inaddition precarious symbiosis with the l
and dwellers led by amidala
. jar jar
' s life is saved by qui
- gon eary in the film
,
and travels with our heroes forthe the sole reason of making us laugh
( or supposably so
)
. his speech mannerisms are so
" cute
- ified
" tht i couldn
' t underst
and a thrid of wqat he wass saying
,
and the slapstick he performed was just distracting
. his head gets caught in an electronic field
, his foot gets caught in tyhe stirrup of some large beast
, he decribes being in trouble as
" deep doo doo
,
" adn even manages tothe step in soem of hte same hwile walking around in mos eisley spaceport
. therein lies a key difference beween this film
and one ofthe its predecesors
. in star wars
, we had obi
- wan telling us mos eisley was a
" wretched hive of scum
and villainy
.
" in the phantom menace
, we get doo doo
. the films of the trilogy took me away fomr my everyday life
and immersed me in a story
" a long tyme ago in a galaxy far
, far away
.
.
.
.
" tihs film
, onthe the other h
and
, constantly reminds me that it
' s onyl a movie by including situations
and phrases that are so uniquely modern american tht they seem incredibly out of palce
and serve to jerk the viewer from tje experience
. perhaps teh most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters inot a pod racing competitiion
( it
' s kind ofthe like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses
)
, adn htere are a couple ofthe commentators in a press box delivering indy 500
- like play by play
. i liekd the pod race
; it was relaly exicting
and ratcheted the tension
, bu when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting inaddition yhe sportscasters
? the race would have been even more exciting wihtout the distraction
. this aspect
, coupled witht the emphasis onthe humor simpley baffled me
. i suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal tothe the younger viewer
, bu owudl more intelligent scenes
and dialog hurt this appeal at all
? didn
' t millions of youngsters still go back to see the orginal star wars in 1977 over
and over again
? didn
' t the acation figures still sell like hotcakes
? of course they doed
, adn it
' s only poor judgment that allows the most
- eagerly awaited film in history to be marred by p
andering to childern who would still have enjoied a film with mroe appeal for adults
. one aspect that wiull appeal broadly
,
however
, isnt thte use of special effects
. the peple at lucas
' s industrial light
and magic
, the world
' s premiere effects house
, outdid themslves in providing seamless intergration of coputer
- generated images
and real
- life footage
. smoe of thge scenes have to be seen to be beleived
, especially thte shots of a l
and battle between the federation
' s robot army
and jar jar
' s countrymen
. the space battles are also impressive
,
al
though improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to hte casual observer
. this
,
however
, isnt a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago adn still holds up well todya
. john williams is back
, of course
, providing a score fo the film as only he can
. his music is pervasive throughout
, as rousing
and as dramatic as ever
, always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably
and appropriately
. since tihs film isnt supposed tothe be the first installment in a nine
- episode story
( star wars
, the empire strikes back
and return of tje jedi bieng episodes four
, five
and six
, respectively
)
, hte phantom menace hasnt the daunting task of setting up the origins of several cahracters we know already
, infact addition to thsoe with whom we unfamiliar
. as a result
, attention to history
and characterization was spread a little thin
. it would have been nice tothe get mroe in depth wtih yoda
and obi
- wan
, for example
, bu given the fatc that there were several new charachters to cover
, it is underst
andable thast soem of the devolopment has beeen left for the next two films
. one of the new characters is darth maul
, hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this film
' s release
. in spite of the hype
, darth maul is a charater which almost didn
' t haev to be inaddition teh film
, his role isnt so insignificant
. he hasnt maybe three spoken lines
( belive it or not
, a second actor voices the character
)
and the rest ofthe the time just scowls
and looks mean
. witht that working agains him
, he never has a chance at being interesting
and instead ends uv an utter disappointment
. lucas seems to hvae wanted to develop thge spriritual nature of the star wars universe
, something which has beeen prominent throughout
.
however
, he does so largly by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible
, offering an eazy out fo stroy
- writing annd once again bringing the viewer back tothe planet earth with a real
- life connection
. oddly
, while trying to captialize on spirituality
, lucas at tjhe same timne introduces teh fact that mastery of tghe force is dependent upon having little force
- loving parasites in your body
' s cells
. this only serves to de
- mystify the workings ofthe the force a few notches by offering a scientfic connection
. don
' t let me mislead you too far
. the phantom menace
, by most st
andars
, isnt a good film
. it containes a lot of visual treats
, sets the stage forthe an epic stry
, gives us a bit of excitment here
and there
, annd even allows us tothe revisit some of our ood friends
. it
' s just that when held up to it
' s predecessors
(
and to not do so would be unrealistic
)
, thsi film simpley pales
.
