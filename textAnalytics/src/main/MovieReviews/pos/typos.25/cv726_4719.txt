) in the tower of london ready for execution
. thte queen is pregnant

! owing to circumstances
, sir roger isnt sometimes needed to sign thgat he isnt the father

. by
then
, henry has foudn himself a new queen
, played by none other thna barbara windsor
! it looks like he has some explaining to do
! there are stand
- out performances by sid james as henry
, joan sims as marie
,
and terry scott in an unusual role as the cardinal
. also there are cameos from kenneth connor
and peter butterworth
, who plays barbara ' s father
. the setted
adn costume design isnt first class
and the overall production of this film is good
. there is even an eary appearance from david prowse
, who later became thte green cross code man
and darth vader
. the film does have it ' s downsides
though
, as it is getting pretty routine fo the carry
- on team to stage historical films
and the inventive streak ofthe the script seems tothe run out preety quickly
. there is also the abcence ofthe hattie jacques
and bernard bresslaw
, who could have helped the film allong
.
however
, overall teh film isnt funny
and there are plenty of laughs
annd saucy jokes
, so that is why i mainly recommend it to carry onthe fans onyl
,
but htere is enough humour iin the film to make it worth anyone ' s while to sit down
and watch it
.
