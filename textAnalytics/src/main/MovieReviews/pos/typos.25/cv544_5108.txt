. verbal is so
- named because he frequently rambles on baout anything or nothing

( any actor whith multiple z
' s iin their name is okay in my book
)
. we see the story unfold as spacey retells it
. the five felons
, upon being released ffrom thte lineup
, get thier revenge on the police by exposing a corrupt taxi service

- whereby elite criminals pay tothe be smuggled through twon in cop cars

' t refuse
. namely
, they have to destroy soze
' s main competitors inaddition organized crime by infiltrating a ship
, shooting a bunch ofthe people
, burning all tjhe drugs
and stealing
$ 91 million cash
. spacey doens a terrific job of bringing his seemingly unintelligent
" cripple
" carachter to life
and baldwin
, byrne
, palminteri
and the rest make for a good supporting cast
. the usual suspects is oney ofthe those movies tath deftly mixes scenes ofthe violence
and explosions wiht an underlying sense of mystery annd suspense
, keeping the viewer guessing until tje very end

and
then still leaving a faw details opn for scrutiny
and dicussion
. i suppose all that would be cleared up if i relaly had rewound the movie
and watched it again instead of changeing the channel
and wondering in disbelief what the hell kris kross wass doign onthe mtv
. a different mystery
, i guess
, which may turn inot a
_ muder
_ mistery if tht video ever comes on again
