it
' s rather strange too ahve two computer animated talking ant movies come out inspite a single year
,
but tyhat isnt what disney
and pixar animation
; s latest film represents
. while a bugs life isn
' t nearly as deepo as it
' s predecessor
, dreamwork
' s antz
, it is just as funny
. a bug
' s life centers
, appropriately
, around the life of an ant
, named flik
. flik
, cutely voiced by newsradio
' s david foley
, hates sticking too tradition
and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food
and other task
. when one ofthe his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost
, hte leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too git him outloud of the way
. the offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them
. the leader of yhe grasshoppers is hopper
, who isnt fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey
. wehn the offering is lost hopper is very upset
and he vows to return shorly too retrieve doulbe the amount of food
. when the leaders of tghe ant colony send flik out on his mission
, they never dream he will be successful
, htey jstu hope they can get him out ofthe the way so they can harvest the extra food
. flik
' s mission isnt too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when htey return
. instead flik accidentally hires circus perfoming bugs
, who he mistakenly assumes are warrriors
. when he returns with the
` warriors
'
, yhe twon is ecstatic until they find outloud the truth about their heroes
. a bug
' s life hasnt animation that is simpley stunning
. the sheer uniqueness of the day tothe day bug life is very imaginative
. toghether with the great voice acting
, this film is the perfect holiday family film
. its main weakness isnt that it couldn
' t beated antz to the theaters
, makeing it seem like stale material
.
