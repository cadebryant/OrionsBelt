it
' s beeen a good long while since we hadnt a good old fashioned thriller
, where mostly everyting goes right for the audience
and wrong for hte characters
,
but it
' s been even longer sicne i saw a thriller tht actually
* shock
* cared fo the charactors
, not merely judged them
but actually allowed their human foibles
, flaws
,
and strengths to emerge so radiantly
. i
' d saw that it
' s been at least a cuple decades
, even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers
,
though i
' m hardly comparing
" a simple plan
" tothe
, say
,
" rear window
" or
" strangers on a train
.
"
yet it
' s almost as ogod
. it
' s simple
, yot strangely complex
,
and astonishingly rewarding
, because instead of moving from plot point tothe plot point
,
and merely laying out htey
- might
- be
- caught overtones
, it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption
and depths of greed that its protagonists cant go to
, all without ever judging them as eather evil or even immoral
. elegantly directed by sam raimi
( yes
, the same
)
,
" a simple plan
" concerns itself with the discovery ofthe a crashed plane
and within a bag full of millions ofthe dollars by an upright
, moderately financially stable working man
( bill paxton
)
, his dim
- witted brother
( billy bob thornton
)
,
and his drinking buddy
( brent briscoe
)
. wihtout anyone around
,
and the possibility thgat no one would come looking for it
, the three debate
and debate
but finally reach the decision that yes
, they iwll keep it
,
but until any authorities or possable owners of the cash come looking
,
and so they generally don
' t flaunt anything they don
' t want to flaunt
, htey
' ll keep it stored away in yhe custody of paxton
. the possibilites ofthe this sercomstance are much diversed
: a
) they could endlessly play cat anbd mouse whith tje authorities
; b
) htey could try to fight off tyhe rightful owners
, who are either villainous or jsut
; or c
) tehy could fight amongst themslves
.
" a simple plan
,
"
though borrows a little from each of these
. a little tiff with tghe cops here
, a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent
( a chilling gary cole
) htere
)
,
and a bit of inside feuding over here
. bu
, as austin powers would sday
, that
' s not necessarily its bag
( baby
)
. what i most admired about this film
,
and what makes this a far superior
and unique thriller is that it
' s successfully able tothe hve its cake
and eat it too
. it effectively involves some ofthe the traditional thriller cliches
, like the ones mentioned above
,
but at the same tyme
, it involves itself more deeply wiht the way the characters become morally corrupt
and wqat price they ahve to pay to have wqat htey think isnt happiness in a black duffle bag
. so hwile steps are taken to neatly cover things up
, anbd these subsequent steps go miserably awry
, tghe film choses to never loose tyhe sight that in covering things uv to teh extent that these characters haev to
, they are slowly loseing their souls
and their humanity
. in one early scene
, paxton
and thornton hvae tothe make a trip back tothe yhe plane to return some ofthe thge monay so it doesn
' t look liuke it was all stolen
( not a bad idae
)
, when thornton screws up
( as he does continuously throughout the movei
)
,
and paxton hasnt to dont some major covering
- up
( read
: homicide
)
. instead of a quick murder anbd immeadiate h
ands
- washing
, raimi shows a lengthy
, painful shot ffrom a low
- angle onto paxton
' s face as he trys to sift through his emotions
and reach a conclusion
. there
' s a similar shooted afterwords of paxton watching hte murder he
' s committing
and tkaing in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective
,
but the previous shooted is even better
: more morally complex
and mroe gut
- wrenching
. in short
, probably the best piece of direction raimi
' s ever done
, demonstrating once again that sometimes tjhe simplest way to dont something yields the best results
( for further proof
, watch
" persona
"
' s
" sex scene
"
and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergman
' s ever done
)
. bu tjhe film hardly stops here
; it follows completely through
and rarely loses sighth ofthe its characters humanity
and the depletion thereof
. yot it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like tghe film isnt merely stamping outloud the plot points of tjhe story
. when the time comes for paxton to strat becoming selfish
and thus diabolical
( with aid ffrom his pregnant wife
, played by bridget fonda
, a pal to raimi
)
, he does
,
and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tradgic heights
. ther
' s at least twpo gr
and shootouts
,
and at least one of them may be one of tjhe greatest shootouts infact cinema history
, anbd when they arrive
, they don
' t cmo with masochistic delight
but with cringe
- inducing horror
. during the one
, i was actually sinking into my chair
, with the mantra
" they can
' t dont this
, cxan they
?
" streeming through my head
. in fact
, this film
, which is getting many comparisons tothe hte coen
' s
[ superior
,
but foreget baout it
]
" fargo
,
" has many similar moments ofthe manic insanity
, atri
buted tothe the major amount of subtlety
and restraint with which thte directors direct what
, in otehr h
ands
, owudl be over
- the
- top distractedness
( imagine
, i supose
, robert rodriguez directing thsi
.
.
.
then again
, after seeing the
" evil dead
" films
, i
' d hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off
,
al
though there are moments ofthe the film which are easily dubbed
" raimi
" moments
, a rifle
- shooted notwhithst
anding
)
. instade
, raimi directs with maturity
and a gentle touch
, easily letting the stry anbd characters co
- exist
, hwile still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out
, liuke smoe offbeat comic touches
. most particularly
, billy bob thornton
' s charactor
, jacob
, is a briliant creation
. his dim
- wittedness is oftenly hilarious
( for most ofthe the film
, every line he uttered ws greeted with howling laughter
)
,
but there
' s au
thenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we
' re not totally laughing at him
. tghe chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of full
- condescension because thornton is so damn real
. jacob
' s a multi
- dimensional character
,
and hwile bieng stupid
, we see thgat as not so much a flaw
,
but a stregth to his character
: his simplicity is endearing
and many ofthe the acts he commits are out of a storng inner strength
and belief system
, primarily towords hte middle where his bud
and co
- conspirator beggins to make smoe heavy waves concerning the money
. the final thrid ofthe the film spends much time witht him
, annd many ofthe yhe touches upon his character
, nto only by thornton
but also by screenwriter scott b
. smith
( adapting his own book
, by the way
) are just great
. i particularly admired a back tsory about an old high school girlfriend
, told by thornton with such sincerity
and acception that hte cruel story is reversed to near
- sweetness
and further strenght ofthe his saddened character
. thornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance
, by far the best peformance he
' s ever given
and further proof that he
' s the best character actor infact contemporary cinema
( if ytou don
' t believe me
, go back
and watch his wonderful performance in
" primary colors
,
" a performance tyhat would have beeen nominated for an oscar if this hadn
' t been in the same year
) because he
' s easily able tothe slip into a character
, adn make him completely
and utterly believable
. he brings so much weight to tje film tath
, as it is wih most character actors
, it
' s difficult picturing anyone esle in the role
. the rest ofthe tyhe casted is great too
, from paxton
' s declining wokring man to chelcie ross
' amiable town sherif
. even fonda shows off her talents nicely
.
and if i had any complaints about the film
, it
' s that the plot is almost too simplistic
,
and thta at times
, it seems too much like an exercise
, like a cruel tust on humanity that still pays attention to tje humanity involved
.
and thge ocassional narration isnt
, as it usualy is
, annoying
( narration shoud be used with extreme caution
, especially when you
' re trying to setted things up
and
/ or express emotions
- didn
' t raimi watch the first murder scene
?
)
. adn
, the thing that can most usually go wrong whith a movie
, the endig is basically amiss
. i won
' t reveal it
,
but it
' s way too cruel
and too much of an outsider set
- up
, as if the apearance of a plane wasn
' t aready too much ofthe that anyway
. for a film that deals so much annd so intimately with the humanity of the cahracters involved
, this is tyhe wrong ending
. imagine a character
- controlled ending
; otherwise
, it
' s like if in
" crime
and punishment
" if the police had caught him instade of him breaking down
and confessing
.
.
. nto that i
' m at all comparing
" a simple plan
" to dostoevsky
. teh ending does work
, despite my protestations
,
but tothe me
, there was something incessantly nagging
and unsatisfying about it
;
but if you had no qualms
and were happy as a clam with it
, thne just ignore me
and go baout your day
.
but dispite my mere claims
, make no mistake that i was completely
and utterly edge ofthe my seat throughout
,
and even sometimes curdling uv by the situations that occured
, not because ofthe any kind of gore factor
( wich is
, thankfully forthe this
, very minimal
)
, bu because the film places its characters in situations
and gives them such painful things to overcome that i
' ve frankly not seen much like it inthe qtuie awhile
. at least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece
.
