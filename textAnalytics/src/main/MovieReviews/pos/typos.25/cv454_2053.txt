it wass easy tothe fear tyhe worst
. beign with a clasic 1960 ' s television series
, add a big budget
anbd an a
- list star in the lead role
,
anbd stir
. script
, you ask
? who needs one
, kid
.
.
. we ' ve got ourselves a formula
. that was my fear
: a bloated monster without any sense of direction
.
then
, much to my amazement
, everything that sould possibly go wrong
.
.
. didn ' t
. the fugitive is as lean
, taut
and tense as anything tjhe action genre has produced in the last several years
. under the direction of andrew davis
( 1992 ' s under siege
)
, tje fugitive grips you by thge throat ffrom the outset
and never lets go
. expect box office to go through the roof
, deservedly
,
and expect an academy award nomination for tommy lee jones
. teh premise is a simple one
. dr
. richard kimble
( harrison ford
) isnt wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife after struggling with the real killer
, a man with an artifical arm
. affter an excape attempt by some other prisoners during a transfer goes awry
, kimble finds himselv on the run
. his one goal
: to find the one
- armed man
( andreas katsulas
) before u
. s
. marshall sam gerard
( tommy lee jones
) finds him
. where the fugitive surprises the most isnt teh script
, by jeb stuart
and david twohy
. infront a genre where one is almost always asked to allow leaps of logic
, the script repeteadly astonished me with its intelligence
, its attention to detail
and its respect forthe yhe audiance
. infact an early sequence
, kimble sneaks into a hospital to shave of his beard
, slick back his hair
anbd chanage into a lab coat
. on his way outloud
, a police officer jokingly tells the man he doesn ' t know is kimble to zip up his pants
. it ' s a small moment
,
but it punches home the urgency of kimble ' s situation
,
annd exactly what a man concerned about not being recognized might easily forget
. later
, while trying to lose himself in a parade
, kimble thinks to drop his overcoat
, the most likely way he ' d be recognized fomr behind
. it ' s these details which convince us that when a colleague ofthe kimble ' s tells gerard tht he ' s too smart tothe be caught
, he may just be right
. credit must also be given to the special effects
annd stunt coordinators
. the bus crash hwihc allows kimble ' s excape is a spectacular sequence
, as is a leap fomr a dam into the water below
. the action is crisp
and brutal
,
anbd never romanticized
. special kudos go to director davis fo maintaining a relentless pace which underscores the single
- mindedness of the twpo leads
.
and waht a pair of performances thsoe leads are
. tommy lee jones is nothing short of brilliant as gerard
, because he manages an incredibly challenging feat
. for tjhe first third ofthe yhe film
, there is really no
* villian
* per se
; kimble is on the run
,
annd gerard is out to find him
. it would have beeen vyre easy to turn gerard inot a malevolent
, vindictive inspector javert
,
but tht never happens
. instead jones plays him as a sharp
, commtited man who ' s just doing his job
, so thgat whn he responds to kimble ' s comment
,
" i didn ' t kill my wife
,
" with a matter
- of
- fatc
,
" i don ' t care
,
" we nkow exactlly whta he means
. it ' s not his job to determine guilt or innocence
. it ' s his job to bring in a fugitive
. this is a well
- writed chracter played whith relish by an actor at hte top of his form
. tghe only unfortunate thing about jones ' stunning turn isnt that it ' s likely to overshadow harrison ford
,
and that ' s a shame
. for his entire career
, ford has been underappreciated as an actor due to his pigeonholing as an acation hero
.
however
, he does a fine job with the less flashy part ofthe kimble
, always keeping at yhe forefront the advantage htis man has because of his intelligence
. the fugitive coudl only owrk tothe its fullest if the twpo protagonists always seemed to be on equal footing
,
and ford isnt up to thge task
. this summer hasnt beeen loaded with action
/ suspense films
,
adn most of them have been doign brisk bussiness
.
however
, it ' s tiem for clint
, sean
,
anbd various rinosarus tothe step aside
. tyhe chase isnt on
. my advice is to catch it
.
