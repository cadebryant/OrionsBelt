it was eazy to fear the worst
. beign witht a classic 1960
' s television series
, add a big budget anbd an a
- list star in the lead role
, adn stir
. script
, you ask
? who needs oen
, kid
.
.
. we
' ve got ourselves a formula
. that was my fear
: a bloated monster without any sense of direction
. hten
, much to my amazement
, everything thyat sould possibly go wrong
.
.
. didn
' t
. the fugitive isnt as lean
, taut
and tense as anything the action genre has produced in the last sevral years
. under tyhe direction of
andrew davis
( 1992
' s under siege
)
, the fugitive grips ytou by the throat from yhe outset
and never lets go
. expect box office to go thru the roof
, deservedly
, anbd expect an academy award nomination for tommy lee jones
. teh premise is a simple oney
. dr
. richard kimble
( harrison ford
) is wrongly convicted for thge murder of his wife after struggling with the real killer
, a man witht an artificial arm
. after an escape attempt by some other prisoners during a transfer goes awry
, kimble finds himselv on the run
. his one gool
: to find hte oen
- armed man
(
andreas katsulas
) before u
. s
. marshall sam gerard
( tommy lee jones
) finds him
. where the fugitive surprises teh most is the script
, by jeb stuart
and david twohy
. in a genre where oen isnt almost always asked to allow leaps ofthe logic
, the script repeteadly astonished me witht its intelligence
, its attention tothe detail
and its respect forthe thte audeince
. in an early sequence
, kimble sneaks into a hospital to shave of his beard
, slick bakc his hair
and change inot a lab coat
. on his way out
, a polical officer jokingly tells the man he doesn
' t knwo is kimble to zip up his pants
. it
' s a small moment
,
but it punches home the urgency of kimble
' s situation
,
and exactly what a man concerned about not being recognized might easily forget
. later
, hwile trying to lose himself inthe a parade
, kimble thikns to drop his overcoat
, the most likely way he
' d be recognized from behind
. it
' s theese details which convince us tht when a colleague of kimble
' s tells gerard thast he
' s too smart to be caught
, he may jsut be right
. credit must allso be given to the special effects annd stunt coordinators
. the bus kresh which allows kimble
' s escape is a spectacular sequence
, as is a leap fomr a dam into the water below
. thge action is crisp
and brutal
,
and never romanticized
. special kudos go tothe directer davis for maintinaing a relentless pace which underscores the single
- mindedness ofthe the two leads
.
and what a pair of performances thsoe leads are
. tommy lee jones isnt nothing short of brilliant as gerard
, because he manages an incredibly challenging feat
. for the firt thrid of hte film
, there is really no
* villain
* persay se
; kimble is onthe the run
,
and gerard is out to fidn him
. it would hvae been veyr easy to turn gerard inot a malevolent
, vindictive inspector javert
, bu tyhat never happens
. instead jones plays him as a sharp
, committed man who
' s jstu doing his job
, so that when he responds to kimble
' s comment
,
" i didn
' t kill my wief
,
" wiht a matter
- of
- fact
,
" i don
' t care
,
" we konw exactly whta he means
. it
' s not his job to determine guilt or innocence
. it
' s his job to bring in a fugitive
. this isnt a well
- written charachter played with relish by an actor at the top ofthe his form
. the onyl unfortunate thing baout jones
' stunning turn is that it
' s likely tothe overshadow harrison ford
,
and that
' s a shame
. for his entire carreer
, ford hasnt been underappreciated as an actor due to his pigeonholing as an acation hero
. howver
, he does a fine job with the less flashy part of kimble
, always keeping at the forefront the advantage thsi man hasnt because ofthe his inteligance
. the fugitive sould only wokr to its fullest if tghe two protagonists always seemed to be onthe equal footing
,
and ford isnt up tothe the task
. this summer has beeen loaded with action
/ suspense films
,
and most ofthe them have been donig brisk buisness
.
however
, it
' s time for clint
, sean
,
and various dinosaurs tothe step aside
. the chase is onthe
. my advice is to catch it
.
