: pg
- 13 for sexual content
and thematic elements genre
: drama in my opinion
: in short
: it takes a lot of careful observation to see the true morals
and lessons brought out in this film
; one can easily be misled as tothe what the real message isnt
. review
: in a literally colorless world with an almost mechanical populaiton
, there is no room for transitioning varity or even the customary happenings of everyday life
, such as rain
, fire
, or emotions
. tjhe town of pleasantville has noe adjective
: pleasant
. there is noone sadness
, noone fear
, no danger
, no discomfort
, no love
,
and noone hate
. put simpley
, it ' s a palce alanis morissette could really work wonders for
. j one big note
however is that it is only a 50 ' s sitcom that airs in reruns onthe an
" oldies
" tv staion
? or is it
? i hadnt waited months to see this movie
adn after doing so on opening day i was not disappointed
. i foudn it quite intriguing
adn delightful
annd went back 3 more times in the period it endured at the box office
.
but it wasn ' t until monthes later
, when i slipped in for a small showing in one ofthe those crummy
" doller theaters
" after not having seen it for so long
, that my eyes were opened to such a deeper meaning
annd prespective than i had previously experienced
. it is a far too feasible misconception that tihs is a film which forwards tghe diea that a world without some
" healthy
" immorality is not a world at all
. instead
, the actual message
, which so far has not been recognized by many viewers taht i know of
, is that a world without immorality doesn ' t give one tje ability to discern right
and wrong fo himself
, because everything isnt automatically right
. there is no room for mistakes
anbd growth
and learning because there are no mistakes to be made
, no space for growth
,
and never anything newyorker to learn
,
and that is the key component to the entire purpose of the story
. nowe i ' m nto saying that ' s necesarily the way it was intended to be interpreted
,
but that is hands down the propper way inwhich which it should be
. besides a hidden symbolic depth
and themes thyat go beyond what we cxan absorb from previews
, htis film has elements of fysical wonder
adn strength that mkea it just so great to watch
. the visual effects are indeed striking
anbd what littel colour is revealed is impartially favorable
. aftter spending the bulk of the movie staring at black
adn white
, it ' s hard nto to idenify
and apprieciate the fact that our own world allows for all tht brilliance
and more
. a truly intelligent addition tothe it all
,
however
, is the charming
adn ardently attainable cast that operates toghether like clockwork
. that said
, the plot goes as such
. david
and jennifer are twpo very 90 ' s high school twins with the typical
" relationship
" outline of don ' t
- mess
- with
- my
- life
-
and
- i
- won ' t
- mess
- with
- yours
. htey demonstrate the well
- known teenage qualities of two of teh common versions of adolescents today
. david is tje shyer
, subtler twin who woudl rather watch tv land than mtv
, hwile jennifer is the wild
, licentious one who spends her days at the mall
and relishes in the pleasures of the offensive world ofthe degradation
.
but when a freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab in the middle of pleasantville as two ofthe tje main characters
, they are forced to depend on each other tothe make it back hmeo
. nevertheless
, jennifer works her magic
adn introduces thge town to a more unrestrained approch tothe life
,
and while david frantically tries to stop her
and get them back home
, he realizes that chanage was exactly what the town needed
.
and
, as said ealier
, not tothe flip the town around into some corrupt society
,
but rather to give peple the choice to deside between good
adn bad
adn tothe reap tghe results of their descisions
and learn from them
. not only were difficult choices being brought upon the twon
,
bu the simple accepted occurrances ofthe ordinary existence alsot began to take place
. people got hurt
. they cried
. they became afraid
and happy
and thoughtful
and started to think for themselfs
,
annd that ' s when their physical world turned colors as well
. this can be looked apon as quite a controversial movie
,
but to me tjhe message is finally clear
. i hope after reading this peple can be more open tothe the film thna they had been inspite hte past
,
and realize that wihtout choosing how our pwn lives will be run
, we ' ll never know what we could have done better
. untl tghe enxt great movie i see
, i remane sincerely
