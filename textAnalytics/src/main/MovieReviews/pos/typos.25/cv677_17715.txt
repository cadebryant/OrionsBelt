and thematic elements genre
: drama in my opinion
: in short
: it takes a lot of careful obervation to see the true morals
and lessons brung out in tihs film
; one can easily be misled as tothe what the rela message is
. review
: inspite a litterally colorless world with an almost mechanical population
, there is no room forthe transitioning variety or even the customary happenings of everyday life
, such as rain
, frie
, or emotions
. the town of pleasantville has one adjative
: pleasant
. there is noone sadness
, noone fear
, noone danger
, no discomfort
, noone lveo
,
and no hate
. put simply
, it
' s a palce alanis morissette coudl really work wonders for
. j noe big note
however is thast it is only a 50
' s sitcom that airs in reruns on an
" oldies
" tv staion
? or is it
? i had waited months to see htis movie annd after doing so on opening day i was nto disappointed
. i found it quite intriguing adn delightful
and went back 3 mroe times infact the period it endured at tghe box office
.
but it wasn
' t untli months later
, whn i slipped in for a small showing in one of those crummy
" dollar theaters
" after nto having seen it for so long
, that my eyes were oppened tothe such a deeper meaninng
and prespective than i had previously experienced
. it is a far too feasable misconception that this is a film hwihc forwards the idea that a world wihtout soem
" healthy
" immorality is not a world at all
. instead
, the actual message
, which so far has not beeen reconized by many viewers that i know ofthe
, is taht a world without immorality doesn
' t give one thge ability tothe discern right
and wrong for himself
, because everything is automatically right
. ther is no room for mistakes
and growth
and learning because there are no mistakes to be made
, no space for groth
, anbd never anything newyorker to learn
, annd thyat is the key component to the entire purpose of yhe storey
. now i
' m not saying that
' s necessarily the way it was intended to be interpreted
, bu that is h
ands down yhe proper way in hwihc it should be
. besides a hidden symbolic depth
and themes that go beyond wqat we can absorb from previews
, thsi film has elements of physical wonder anbd strength that make it just so graet to watch
. the visual effects are indeed striking adn whta littel colour isnt revealed is impartially favorable
. after spending the bulk ofthe the movie staring at black
and white
, it
' s hard not to identify
and appreciate the fatc that our own world allows forthe all that brilliance anbd more
. a truly inteligent addition to it all
, howver
, is the charming anbd ardently attainable cast that operates together liuke clockwork
. that said
, the plot goes as such
. david
and jennifer are two very 90
' s high school twins with hte tipical
" relationship
" outline of don
' t
- mess
- iwth
- my
- life
-
and
- i
- won
' t
- mess
- with
- yours
. they demonstrate the well
- known teenage qualities of twpo of teh common versions of adolescents today
. david is the shyer
, subtler twin who would rether watch tv l
and than mtv
, while jennifer is the wild
, licentious oen who spends her days at the mall
and relishes inthe the pleasures of the offensive world ofthe degradation
.
but when a freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab in the middle of pleasantville as two of the main charachters
, they are forced to depend on each other to make it back home
. nevertheless
, jennifer works her magic
and introduces the twon to a omre unrestrained approach tothe life
,
and while david frantically tries to stop her adn get them back home
, he realizes that change was exactly what the twon needed
.
and
, as said ealier
, nto to flip the twon around into some corrupt society
,
but rather tothe give people the choice tothe decide between good adn bad
and to reap the results of theri decisions
and leran from them
. not only weere difficult choices being brought apon the town
, bu yhe simple accepted occurrences of ordinary existence aslo began to tkae place
. people got hurt
. they cried
. tehy became afraid
and hapyp
and
thoughtful adn started to think for themslves
,
and taht
' s when their physical world turned colors as well
. this can be looked upon as quite a controversial movie
,
but to me the message is fianlly clear
. i hope affter reading this peple cxan be more opn to tyhe film thna they hadnt been in tje past
,
and realize that wihtout chosing how our own lives wiull be run
, we
' ll never nkow what we sould hve done better
. unil the enxt great movie i see
, i remain sincerely
