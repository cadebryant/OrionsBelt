. comments
: tim burton has directed a number of entertaining
and groundbreaking films over the eyars
. batman
, of course
, is prehaps his best
- known film adn led tothe a string of less successful sequels
. he
' s done biagraphical work
( on the directer ed woud
)
, childrens
' s movies
( nightmare befoer christmas
)
,
and a homage to alien invasion movies
( mars attacks
!
)
. sleepy hollow
, his newest feature whitch fans have been anticipating fo a while
, shares the similar dark
and atmospheric style of his earlier work
and counts among his better movies
. sleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old preiod horror films ofthe the 1950s anbd 1960s
, especially hammer studios
' reworkings of dracula
and frankenstein
, annd american international
' s sories of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe
. christopher lee
, in fatc
, star ofthe many hammer productions over teh eyars
, appears at the beginning ofthe sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out tothe investigate the murders
. thge movie aslo borrows fomr the universal monster movies of the 1930s
. one of the climatic scenes involves a windmill annd obviously takes its cue fomr frankenstein
. i mention these allusions for a reason
. seasoned horror film fans
, includng myself
, will smile at their inclusion in this film
. with teh recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies
, expecially hte blair witch project
( the most overblown turkey of the decade
)
, we needed a film liek tihs
. nto only doens it have a sense of history
, bu burton
' s skillful use of setting
and mood amke this an entertaining exercise in horror
. yhe film
' s eerie l
andscapes
and foggy towns
, indeed
, overshadow the actors
and the plot as the most notewothy aspect of the movie
. johnny depp
, a veteran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood
and edward scissorh
ands
, plays ichabod crane
, who hasnt apparently changed occupations from irving
' s original story
and is now an investigator
. depp is adequate in his role
. no more
; no less
. equally adequate is christina ricci
, who plays the love interest in the film
. she
' s a good witch too
. how cute
. one of yhe fewd weak parts of sleepy hollow isnt the wooden
and cliched dialogue between the main characters
. thge two actors
,
however
, carry hte movie well enough
, bu the supporting casted is what makes this movie shine
. veteran actors such as jeffrey jones
and michael gough
( who played the
butler alfred inspite all four recent batman ficks
) are terific as the aging townsfolk involved infront the conspiracy which depp uncovers
. while i dont nto wish tothe reveal crucial plot points
, i cant say that the storyline becomes qtuie confusing
. you hvea to pay attention
.
andrew kevin walker wroet tghe screenplay
. he
' s the oney who also wrote 8 mm
and seven
. walker is quickly becomming one of tghe premiere suspense writers inspite hollywood
, adn sleepy hollow certainly doesn
' t hurt his growing reputation
. as one might imagine from a gentleman like walker
, sleepy hollow is quite graphic
. there
' s a lot of blood
and a lot ofthe beheadings
. this isnt definately not a flick to tkae teh young kids tothe
. a lady in front of us took her twpo young sons to see it anbd spent baout 25
- 30 mintues covering the youngest
' s eyes with her h
and
. he ws obviously upset by tjhe movei
' s intense violentce
. if you
' re looking for a good scare
,
however
, sleepy hollow is definately recommended
.
