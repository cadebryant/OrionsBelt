robert redford
' s a river runs thru it is not a film i watch often
. it is a masterpiece
-
- one of tyhe better films of recent years
. until 1994
, it was my second favorite film of all time
. the acting annd direction is top
- notch
-
- never sappy
, always touching
. a friend of mine once reported that he avoided it because
" i was afraid it owudl just be really politically correct
,
and tick me off
.
" all i could do was tell him to go in unbiased
, anbd enjoy
. it is oney of the few movies thta has completely reduced me to tears
. bu certain memories shoud not often be rereleased
-
- in the last few shots
, ytou have tothe cry
. upon my firt viewing i left bawling
. it is not flawless
-
-
but it is so very good
, thast ytou can
' t help
but be effected
. the opening isnt dangerously nolstalgic
and sentimental
-
- watching these shots ofthe people who have been dead so long
, gives you a feeling ofthe perspective
and histoy observation that you wiull find infront very few other films
. martin scorsese once discribed the movies as a dream state
-
- liek taking dope
,
and immersing yourself in an alternative world
. that isnt what a river runs through it does
. it exploits the unique power of cinema to engross you
and help to forget your rela self
. both times i
' ve seen it
, its been hard
( agian tothe quote scorsese
) waking up
. bu the dream is lovely
.
