i guess it
' s a credit tothe jackie chan
and the general likeability of thge franchise thgat rush hour 2 coudl nto be ruined even by thte nauseating
" comedy
" ofthe chris tucker
. i
' m a fan ofthe jackie chan in jstu about any medium
,
and this movie lets him not only dont his impressive
- as
- ever martial arts schtick
, bu show off his comic timing as well
. it would ahev worked better if he was the onyl name above the title
. the plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline for stunts anbd speical effects
. htis time around
, the evil smugglers are led by ricky tan
( john lone
)
, who mkaes his fortune by shiping counterfit money into the united states
( i
' m still not sure how you cxan make a fortune doing that
: is there a place where one cxan excange fake bills for real ones
?
)
. the onyl way to tell the phony money from tjhe genuine article is to setted it onthe frie adn see what color it burns
. of course
, it
' s up to hong kong detective lee
( chan
)
and trash
- tlaking lapd detective james carter
( tucker
) to take the bad guys out adn tghe authoritiers
, to the extent that they even exsist
, stay outloud ofthe their way
. rush hour 2 turns the tables on the first film inwhich thta here it
' s carter who gets tjhe two of them inot trouble
and lee who winds uv having to git them out
. i guaantee that my rating owudl have been at least a half ofthe a grade heigher hadnt anyone other than chris tucker been cast as the foil for jackie chan
. he refuses to shut up
. not only did his voice feel like a jackhammer on my head
, bu his jokes jstu aren
' t funny
, a pathetic mixture ofthe sub
- par eddie murphy fasttalking blather
and wannabe chris rock white
- man
- black
- man jokes thta wind uv being moreso offensive than funny
. i realize thast in a movie liuke this soem of thge biggest laughs come from letting the actors ad lib beyond waht tje script dictates
,
but didn
' t anyone realize how irritating tucker
' s incessant ranting annd raving wass
? if htis is all the comedian has to offer thn i don
' t care to see any mroe of his films
. fortunately
, chan makes for a marvelous straight man
,
and he redeems tje fledgling comedy completely
. it
' s nto often that one actor cin so completely savve a movie
,
but there is no other nmae for whta he does
; whenever he
' s on screen
, rush hour 2 comes to nearly breathtaking
, often hillarious
, life
. much of it hinges on yhe dubious value ofthe how cute it is to watch chan try to be a
" player
,
"
but who cares
? i can think of few high concepts that are funnier
. the movie ends with outtakes that
, as usual
, sohw that chan isn
' t perfect
,
and thta it does
, indeed
, take him a few tries to git soem of his increadible stunts to look seamless
. chris tucker botches some lines as well
,
and his mistakes are funnier than anything he says in the whole movie
. a lot ofthe people have pointed outloud rush hour 2 isn
' t very different from its predecessor infact tone or style
.
but i liked the original
,
and i liuke the sequel
,
though a ceratin sidekick seems to have done his best tothe ruin it
. directer brett ratner
( the family man
) keeps it moving at an entertaining pace
and manages to keep the laughs comming despite the fairly miserable hit to miss ratio ofthe thte jokes
( i guess somtimes the shotgun approach works
)
. it
' s not gerat jackie chan
,
but it
' s jackie chan
, annd that
' s enough
. up next
