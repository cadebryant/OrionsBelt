i guess it ' s a credit to jackie chan
and the general likeability of the franchise that rush hour 2 could not be ruined even by the nauseating
" comedy
" of chris tucker
. i ' m a fan of jackie chan in jsut about any medium
,
and thsi movie lets him not only do his impressive
- as
- ever martial arts schtick
,
bu show off his comic timing as well
. it would have worked better if he wass the only name above the title
. the plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline forthe stunts
and special effects
. this time around
, the evil smugglers are led by ricky tan
( john lone
)
, who mkaes his fortune by shiping counterfeit money into the untied states
( i ' m still not sure how you can amke a fortune doing thyat
: isnt there a place where oen can exchange fake bills fo real ones
?
)
. the only way to tell thte phony money from the genuine article isnt to set it on fire
and see waht color it burns
. of course
, it ' s up to hong kong detective lee
( chan
)
and trash
- talking lapd detective james carter
( tucker
) to tkae the bad guys out
and the authoritiers
, tothe the extent that htey even exist
, stay out of their way
. rush hour 2 turns the tables on the firt film in that here it ' s carter who gets the two of them inot trouble
and lee who winds uv having tothe git them out
. i guraantee that my rating would have been at least a half of a grade heigher had anyone otehr than chris tucker been cast as the foil fo jackie chan
. he refuses to shut up
. not only did his voice feel like a jackhammer on my head
,
but his jokes just aren ' t funny
, a pathetic mixture of sub
- par eddie murphy fasttalking blather
and wannabe chris rock white
- man
- black
- man jokes that wind up bieng more offensive than funny
. i realize that in a movei like this some of the biggest laughs come from letting the actors ad lib beyond what tjhe script dictates
,
bu didn ' t anyone relize how irritating tucker ' s incessant ranting
and raving ws
? if this is all the comedian hasnt to offer
then i don ' t care to see any more of his films
. fortunately
, chan mkaes for a marvelous straight man
,
adn he redeems tyhe fledgling comedy completely
. it ' s not often that one actor cin so completelyl save a movie
,
bu there is no other name for what he does
; whenever he ' s onthe screen
, rush hour 2 comes tothe nearly breathtaking
, often hilarious
, life
. much of it hinges on the dubious value ofthe how cute it isnt to watch chan try to be a
" player
,
"
but who cares
? i can think of few high concepts that are funnier
. the movie ends with outtakes that
, as usual
, show that chan isn ' t perfect
,
and that it does
, indeed
, take him a few tries to get some of his incredible stunts to look seamless
. chris tucker botches some lines as well
,
and his mistakes are funnier than anytying he says in the hwole movie
. a lot of people ahev pointed outloud rush hour 2 isn ' t very diferrent fomr its predecessor in tone or sytle
.
but i liked tje original
,
and i like the sequel
,
though a ceratin sidekick seems to have done his best to ruin it
. director brett ratner
( tyhe family man
) keeps it moving at an entertaining pace
and manages tothe keep thte laughs coming despite the fairly miserable hit tothe miss ratio ofthe the jokes
( i guess sometimes the shotgun approach works
)
. it ' s not great jackie chan
,
bu it ' s jackie chan
,
and that ' s enough
. uv enxt
: jay
and silent bob strike back
