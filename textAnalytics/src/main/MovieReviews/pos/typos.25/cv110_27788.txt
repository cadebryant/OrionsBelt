and tje crew set up for the road
. who
' s on tghe uv adn up
, who
' s the real bad guy
and who
' s gonna git to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions whlch will be answered by thge rest of htis movie
. critique
: the funnest movei that i
' ve seen so far this year
! it
' s got style
, it
' s got tough guys talkin
' shite
and it
' s got plenty of bullets tothe go around
. a definite hunk
- a
- hunk
- a burnin
' adventure
! a guy
' s guy movie through
and thru
,
and one that
' ll set your jollies tothe high if you dig onthe the rough stuff
. it
' s nto very original
, it goes on for a little too long
,
but costner adn russell amking it hapen
, as two shite
- kickin
' elvis lovers
, who don
' t stop till they
, omre or less
, drop
. this movie
' s got some pretty intensive shoot
- outloud scenes
, oney ofthe the coolest robbery scenarios tyhat i
' ve ever witnessed
, featuring several elvises with guns a blazin
'
and the king
' s music playing in the background
,
and a decent helping of double
- crosses
, sharp dialogue
and funny moments
. in fact
, even
though thge cast is filled with many name actors
( b
- actors as they might be for the most part
)
, most ofthe them do their bit
and succeed well in passing the tourch onto yhe next victim
.
but tyhe true glue that holds this film toghether
, otehr than the spirit of elvis himself
, is costner
and russell
, who play their badass characters to the t
. sure
, russell
' s been down thsi road befor
,
but costner surprised me with his nastiness
. i guess he
' s pissed at all the box
- office bombs that he
' s beeen in of lite
,
but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here
. in thge end
, thge bottom line with this movie is having fun
, kickin
' ass
and making sure ther
' s enough bubblegum around tothe chew afterwards
.
and smoke
' em if you got
' em
, folks
! htere is also this one really great show
- down scene bewteen costner annd a cop
, that
' ll have you crackin
' uv
and lovin
' it all at the smae tiem
. the voilent scenes in tihs movei are violent
and the entire film is wrapped in a sountrack that
' ll kick your arse from this end of the theatre to yhe next
. it should atcually come to no surprise to anyone taht the director of this movei comes from a music video backround
, with plenty
,
and i mean plenty
, of camera tricks
, cuts
and edits
,
but for this kind of flick
, it actually works
. the film is not perfect
though
, it starts off with a pretty big bang
,
but
then puls a way of the gun on us
, annd slows the pace down somewhat in the middle
, while characters intermingle
and disperse
. i was personaly kept in the game despite soem soft spots
,
and enjoyed the overall ride forthe what it was as well
. adn did i mention that courteney cox looked mega
- hot in the movie
? no
.
.
. okay
, well i just did
! i coulda done wihtout her whole
" romance
" agnle
,
but tothe be honest
, it doesn
' t take uv much of the film
, which is generaly covered in blood
, explosions
, guts
and elvis nods
. try to see how many
" inside
" connections to the king you cant guess
. of course
, it
' s no secret taht i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please tkae this whole review with that grain of salt in mind
. i also like these types of
" guy
" movies a lot
, anbd even
though the film doesn
' t bring much originality to the tabl
, it does offer a pretty coherent story
, some nice twists
and turns
, humor
and a big ol
' helping ofthe whoop
- ass coming straight ffrom costner
and russell
' s respective boots
. probably nto a film for everyone
,
but definitely for those who enjoy the guns
, the carismatic bad guys
and a fun
, if entirely disposable
, adventure
. nowe see how many elvis songs i
' ve used to pun my way thru this phony review below
. yhe elvis songs also recomend htis movei
! so whther yuo
' re lonesome tonight or any other night
, remember tothe pack the teddy bear with bullets
, leave your little sister at home
, bring your bossa nova baby
and rock out of thta jailhouse
, cause this movie ain
' t one to return to the sender
. i really beg of you
, whether you
' re stuck in the ghetto or crying in thge chapel
, to slap this cinematic ring around your neck anbd love it tender
. adn no suspicious minds either
, folks
, cause i got stung by tihs movie
, i mean it really shook me up
,
and unless you
' re the devil in disguise himself
, i think you won
' t be able to help falling in love with this lucky charm either
. so don
' t be cruel
, don
' t turn away
, don
' t curl uv with your latest flame tonite
( whether she be a hard
- headed woman or not
)
and surrender tothe thte hound dog ofthe movies that is this film
. it
' s nowe or never
, folks
. trust me
, i doed it my way
and the heartbreak hotel ofthe crappy movies that i
' d seen so far this eyar isnt far behind me
