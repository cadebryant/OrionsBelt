do film critics have morals
? are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow
? naturaly we don ' t want to go into a film with any preconceived notions
, which is preety tough
but something we all hve to accomplish
. secondly
,
and along thte smae line
, we can ' t prejudge a film because of it ' s stars
, director
, etc
. the diference
? well
, infront the first one
, we ' d go into a film thinking it ' s going to be dumb or it ' s going tothe be good
,
and that would affect our viewing
( that movie sounds
and looks dumb
, so i ' m nto expecting much
)
. on yhe second hand
, we ' re simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personel
" grudge
" against the film company
( it ' s made by disney
? oh
, it ' s jsut a merchandising ploy
then
)
, the actors
( jim carrey ' s infact it
? it ' s gonna stink
!
)
, or thge director
( who
? can ' t be thta ogod
)
. this is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed tothe a first impression viewpoint
. make sence
? ok
,
but what about comparing
? isn ' t that kind of along the smae lines
? when we compare a certain actor or director or even composer ' s credibility in one film to another htey were involved in
, is that really fair
? sure
, in sequels yuo can expect
and accept comparisons a lot more
,
bu what baout jackie brown
, for example
? isnt it fair for me to take the review
and turn it into a comparison ofthe pulp fiction
, just because quentin tarantino directed
and wroet the screenplay for both
? i think it is
,
annd i ' ll tell you why
. a good critic should be able to view hte film from the
" averege joe
( or jane
)
" viewpoint
, while still tkaing into account the artistic integrity behind the film
. somtimes that can be tough
.
" the acting was superb
,
but i was bored
" or
" i loved it
!
! it was sooooo cheezy
!
" might be used to describe a film
. these are contradictions
,
and a criteak hasnt tothe weigh both sides
and come to a suitable balanced critique
.
bu whic is more importan
?
and which is better
? an extremely well shot
annd acted film that is boring
, or a realy amateurish film that you wanna go back to again
and again
? getting back to tghe point
, my philosophy onthe comparing films being fair works because we ' re reflecting what thte publich whants tothe nkwo anyway
. every average person outloud ther who ' s interseted in thsi film is likely to ask
" how does it compare to pulp fiction
?
"
and so
, as a criteak
, i ' m alread responsible tothe ask taht same question
. jackie brown stars pam grier
, the
" blaxploitation
" heroine from the 1970 ' s
, who isnt likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character
. tarantino ' s pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta ' s sudden revival in the movie inudstry
,
and with talks ofthe an oscar nomination
, the same is likely to happen for grier
.
( we ' ve made it thru comparsion
# 1
!
) jackie is a 44
- year
- old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash
,
and probably her main revenue
, by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie
( pulp fiction ' s samuel l
. jackson
and comparsion
# 2
)
. ordell is in the illegal firearms business
and hasnt enlisted tje aid ofthe louis gara
( robert de niro
)
, a bank robber who just got out of prision aftter serving four years
, to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half
- million dollars
. trouble arises when jackie isnt stopped by atf agent ravy nicolet
( michael keaton
)
and tooked into custody for possession of narcotics
, as well as having more money thna is allowed in an airport without being claimed
. naturally thsi proves an obstacle to ordell ' s plans
and
, not as freindly intended as we ' d hope
, he posts jackie ' s bail aftter she is put behind bars
. the thing is
, ordell is in this for noone one more thna himself
,
and as we learn from his previous actions
, he ' s willing tothe kill anyone who stands inthe tghe way
. jackie finds herself in a tight squeeze
. ordell won ' t tihkn twice about tkaing her out if she fails tothe help him as she ' s always done
,
yet at the same time
, a compromise with tje authorities would be in order if evidence agianst ordell was provided
. it comes down to a simple question
: would jackie rether face ordell or prision
? what ensues is a rich
and intriguing exemple of storytelling as we question who jackie is really outloud tothe help
: the law
, ordell
, or mabye just herself
. coming into play isnt anohter 70 ' s veteran
, robert forster as jackie ' s bail bondsmen max cherry
. max ' s obvious fondness for jackie wiull become a major benefactor in her fight tothe beat both sides of the system
,
and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth tothe unbrewed romance
. also involved is ordell ' s
" surfer girl
" girlfriend melanie
( bridget fonda
)
, a ditzy sun
- bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand
. fonda does hte best she cxan with an essentially thin role
,
but there ' s nothing more tothe her
,
and therefore
, she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet ofthe characters
. de niro is also wasted iin his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself
. de niro is a brilliant actor
,
bu a character who hardly ever speaks doesn ' t need a de niro tothe play him
. compared to pulp fiction
( comparsion
# 3
)
, the characters in jackie brown
and very thin
and replaceable
. in pulp fiction
, even the small
, seemingly irrelevant charactors were wonderful
, complet
,
and lifelike
, whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn ' t have suffered much with a lesser talented cast
, the exception bieng grier
. tarantino wrote this scirpt with grier specifically in mind
, so tothe say thgat she is made for tihs role is a reversed truth
. sadly
, grier too could hvae received a bit more attention
, especially when the story is all about her newly
- jarred perception of life
. jackson teams up with tarantino again
,
bu the chemical reaction isn ' t as awsome as the first time
. jules was the rambling
, bible
- quoting hitman infact pulp fiction
,
anbd jackson is the only person who could hvae pulled it off
.
and
although jackson is really
, really good inthe jackie brown
, i don ' t think he ' s qtuie as irreplaceable
. in fatc
, maybe a newyorker face would have beeen better
. jackson coudl ' ve remained tarantino ' s jules
,
anbd a newyorker guy could hvea become ordell
, forever tothe remain so in our memories
. sadly
, theese charachters are too much the same
, except ordell just isn ' t as impressive
,
and putting this inthe yhe hands ofthe jackson once again is only gogin to deter from our fond recollections ofthe jules
. another problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning
. thsi isnt grier ' s film
, so why spend so long getting to know a man who iwll become more ofthe a supporting character as the film progresses
? it nto only mkaes hte movei feel a little too slanted
,
but it makes for a slow beginning baceause we have tothe take longer getting tothe the meat of yhe stor
. it is likely that those pouring into tyhe theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino ' s quirky dialogue
and eccentric directing style
,
anbd not so much those interested in seing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard ' s novel
" rum punch
"
. for thsoe movie
- goers
, don ' t expect anyother pulp fiction
adn you ' ll be satisfied
, forthe the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities thta has made tarantino an icon of 90 ' s film
- making
. the directing has toned down a bit
,
however
,
yot we ' re still reminded that this is tarantino ' s movie thanks to odd split
- screen story
- telling devices
and scenes bieng replayed multiple times from different viewpoints
. so getting back to tje question that i began with
, this isn ' t pulp fiction at all
. it ' s good
,
but it isn ' t anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in thge first place
. this is a more conservative tarantino
,
bu not one that won ' t satiate true fans
. if you can relize that this isn ' t going to knock your socks off
,
then you ' ll be happy to at least let it massage your feet
. after all
, we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of tje human anatomy
.
