do film critics have morals
? are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow
? naturally we don
' t wanna tothe go inot a film with any preconceived notions
, hwihc is pretty tough
but something we all have to accomplish
. secondly
,
and allong the same line
, we can
' t prejudge a film baceause of it
' s stars
, director
, etc
. the difference
? well
, in the first one
, we
' d go into a film thinking it
' s gonig to be dumb or it
' s goign to be good
,
and that would affect our viewing
( thast movie sounds
and looks dumb
, so i
' m not expecting much
)
. on thte second h
and
, we
' re simply assuming it will be bad or good because ofthe a personal
" grudge
" against the film company
( it
' s made by disney
? oh
, it
' s just a merch
andising ploy
then
)
, the actors
( jim carrey
' s in it
? it
' s gonna stink
!
)
, or the directer
( who
? can
' t be thast good
)
. thsi isnt more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a frist impression viewpoint
. make sense
? ok
,
but what about comparing
? isn
' t that kind ofthe along the same lines
? when we compare a certain acotr or director or even composer
' s credibility in one film to another they were involved in
, is thta really fair
? sure
, in sequels ytou can expect
and accept comparisions a lot more
,
but what baout jackie brown
, forthe example
? isnt it fair fo me to tkae the review
and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction
, just because quentin tarantino directed
and wrote the screenplay for both
? i think it is
,
and i
' ll tell you why
. a good critic should be able to view tyhe film from hte
" averege joe
( or jane
)
" viewpoint
, hwile still taking inot account the artistic integrity behind tghe film
. sometimes that cxan be tough
.
" the acting was superb
,
but i was bored
" or
" i loved it
!
! it was sooooo cheezy
!
" might be used tothe describe a film
. these are contradictions
, adn a critic has to weigh both sides adn come tothe a suitable balanced critique
.
but which is more important
? adn which is better
? an extemely well shot annd acted film that is boring
, or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to agian
and again
? getting back to thte point
, my philosophy onthe comparing films being fair works becuase we
' re reflecting what the public wants to nkow anyway
. every averege person out there who
' s interested in this film is likely to ask
" how does it compare tothe pulp fiction
?
"
and so
, as a criteak
, i
' m already responsible to ask that same question
. jackie brown stars pam grier
, the
" blaxploitation
" heroine fomr the 1970
' s
, who is likely to make a big comeback thanks tothe her role as teh title character
. tarantino
' s pulp fiction isnt in big part responsible forthe john travolta
' s sudden revival in the movie industry
, anbd with talks of an oscar nomination
, the same is likely to happen for grier
.
( we
' ve made it thru comparison
# 1
!
) jackie is a 44
- year
- old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash
,
and probaly her main revenue
, by smuggling large sums ofthe monye into the untied states forthe ordell robbie
( pulp fiction
' s samuel l
. jackson
and comparison
# 2
)
. ordell isnt inthe thte ilegle firearms business
and has enlisted the aid of louis gara
( robert de niro
)
, a bank robber who just got out of prision after serving four years
, to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half
- million dollars
. trouble arises when jackie isnt stopped by atf agent ray nicolet
( michael keaton
)
and taken into custody for possession of narcotics
, as well as haveing more money thna is allowed in an airport without bieng claimed
. naturally this proves an obstacal tothe ordell
' s plans
and
, not as freindly intended as we
' d hope
, he posts jackie
' s bail affter she is put behind bars
. the hting isnt
, ordell isnt in this for no one more than himself
, adn as we learn from his previous actions
, he
' s willing to kill anyone who st
ands in the way
. jackie finds herself in a tight squeeze
. ordell won
' t think twice about tkaing her out if she fails to halp him as she
' s alwasy done
, yot at the same time
, a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided
. it comes down to a simple question
: would jackie rather face ordell or prison
? what ensues is a rich
and intriguing exemple of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help
: the law
, ordell
, or maybe just herself
. coming inot play isnt another 70
' s vetran
, robert forster as jackie
' s bail bondsmen max cherry
. max
' s obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight tothe beat both sides of the system
, anbd forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance
. also involved is ordell
' s
" surfer girl
" girlfriend melanie
( bridget fonda
)
, a ditzy sun
- bleached babe who spends her tiome watching tv with a bong in h
and
. fonda does the best she can witht an essentially thin role
, bu there
' s nothing more to her
,
and therefore
, she becomes a tossable addtion to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters
. de niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook outloud tothe score a faw bucks for himself
. de niro is a brilliant acto
,
but a charachter who hardly ever speaks doesn
' t ened a de niro to play him
. compared to pulp fiction
( comparison
# 3
)
, thge characters in jackie brown
and veyr thin
and replaceable
. in pulp fiction
, even the small
, seamingly irrelevant characters were wonderful
, complete
, adn lifelike
, wherease jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn
' t have suffered much with a lesser talented cast
, the exception being grier
. tarantino wroet thsi script with grier specifically infact mind
, so to say that she is made forthe this role is a reversed truth
. sadly
, grier too could have received a bit moreso attention
, especially wehn the story is all about her newly
- jarred perception ofthe life
. jackson teams up with tarantino again
,
but the chemcial reaction isn
' t as awesome as the first time
. jules was the rambling
, bible
- quoting hitman in pulp fiction
,
and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off
.
and
al
though jackson is really
, raelly good in jackie brown
, i don
' t think he
' s quite as irreplaceable
. in fact
, maybe a new face would have been better
. jackson could
' ve remained tarantino
' s jules
,
and a new guy could have become ordell
, forever tothe remain so inaddition our memories
. sadly
, these characters are too much tghe same
, except ordell jsut isn
' t as impressive
,
and puting this in thte h
ands of jackson once again isnt only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules
. another problem is that ordell isnt way too focused onthe inthe the beginnig
. thsi is grier
' s film
, so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses
? it not only makes the movie fiel a littel too slanted
, bu it makes for a slow beginnig because we hve to tkae longer getting tothe the meat of the story
. it isnt likely that thsoe pouring into the theater tothe see this film are going to be those anxious tothe partake of tarantino
' s quirky dialogue
and eccentric directing style
, annd not so much those interested in seing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard
' s novel
" rum punch
"
. forthe thsoe movei
- goers
, don
' t expect anyother pulp fiction annd you
' ll be satisfied
, for the script oozes with the familliar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon ofthe 90
' s film
- making
. tjhe directing has toned down a bit
,
however
,
yet we
' re still reminded thgat this is tarantino
' s movie thanks to odd splitted
- screen story
- telling devices
and scenes being replayed multiple times fomr different viewpoints
. so getting back tothe the question that i began with
, htis isn
' t pulp fiction at all
. it
' s good
,
but it isn
' t anything thgat made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the firt place
. this is a more conservitive tarantino
,
but not one that won
' t satiate true fans
. if yuo can realize that this isn
' t going to knock your socks off
, thn you
' ll be hapyp tothe at least let it massage your fezent
. after all
, we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part ofthe the human anatomy
.
