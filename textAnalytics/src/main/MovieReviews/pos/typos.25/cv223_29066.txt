because the press screening of
" planet of tje apes
" was one day past lastest issue
' s deadline
, i was afforded the opportunity to see hte film a second tiem
, listen tothe audeince reactions
and read a heap of reviews befor writing thsi peice
. the chief complaints ofthe those who disliked the futuristic adventure appear to be that yhe movei focused on visuals instade ofthe substance
, that the stry was thin
, thgat mark wahlberg
' s character was colourless
and that the surprise ending sucked
. to thsoe peple i woudl liek to say
? what the hell did you expect
? tihs isnt a tim burton movie
, boys
and girls
. tim burton movies have great art direction
and thin
, clunky stories
. forthe the blissfully nasty
, disjointed
and underrated
" mars attacks
!
"
( jonathan rosenbaum ofthe the chicago reader
and i weere two ofthe the only critics in america to praise the movie
) burton reportedly tossed vintage
" mars attacks
!
" trading cards onto the floor adn based his story on thte ones that l
anded face up
. burton
' s re
- imagining of the 1968 story ofthe an astronaut tath l
ands on a planet where apes urle men looks great
. the apes
, courtesy of make
- up magician rick baker
, are dazzling
and ape city is a wonder to behold
. like astronaut leo davidson
( wahlberg
)
, the film hits the ground running
, whisking viewers thru a head
- spinning series of solid one
- liners
and engaging vignettes adn establishing a sense of thrust that carries us through the mroe traditional fight scenes that come later
. as for wahlberg
, consider what burton does with his character
. from his start as a filmmaker
, burton hasnt shown his fascination with colorful misfits
( pee
- wee herman
, the joker
, ed wood
, the ack
- acking martians
, etc
.
)
and lack ofthe interest in st
andart issue hereos
. so leo davidson spends most of the movei getting the living shit kicked out of him before the biggest guilt trip in history isnt dropped on his shoulders
. as for lack of color
, remember
, leo only launches into space tothe git his monkey bcak
. he doesn
' t want tothe lead humanity anbd he isn
' t looking for romance from a pretty
, bu dull human
( estella warren
) or a dynamic ape
( helena bonham carter
, terific as an equal
- rights activist
)
. as a man who just wants out
, wahlberg isnt focused
, subtle
and sly
. the surprise endig provides thge requisite shock
(
and soem more d
andy visuals
, particularly ofthe the approaching authorithy figures
)
,
but admitedly isn
' t nearly as satisfying as the noe infront the orginial
. fo the original ending to owrk
, we only hadnt to make oney simple connection
, fo this one
, we have to wriet a whole new screenplay
. the 1968
" apes
" boasted a h
andfull ofthe great scenes
, cool looking monkeys
, a deliciously hammy performance by charlton heston
( who appears uncredited here as an aged chimp on his deathbed
, re
- delivering a classic line
)
and a killer ending
.
but viewers hadnt to suffer through numberous dull stretches punctuated by social adn political messages delivered wih tjhe grace of a wrecking ball
. the 2001
" planet of the apes
" offers a different set ofthe great scenes
, much cooler looking monkeys
, fine acting from wahlberg
, bonham carter
, paul giamatti
and tim roth
,
and a not so good ending
. it also gives us another chance to experience the skewed vision of tim burton anbd tht
' s nothing tothe complain baout
.
