because the press screening of
" planet of the apes
" was oen day past last issue ' s deadline
, i was afforded the opportunity to see the film a second tyme
, listen tothe audience reactions
annd read a heap of reviews befor writing htis piece
. the chief complaints of thsoe who disliked the futuristic adventure appear tothe be that the movie focused on visuals instead ofthe substance
, that the story was thin
, tath mark wahlberg ' s chracter wass colourless
and that the suprize ending sucked
. to those peple i woudl like to sday
? wqat the hell doed you expect
? this is a tim burton movie
, boys
annd girls
. tim burton movies have great art direction
anbd thin
, clunky stories
. for the blissfully nasty
, disjointed
annd underrated
" mars attacks
!
"
( jonathan rosenbaum of hte chicago reader
and i were two of the only critics in america to praise the movie
) burton reportedly tossed vintage
" mars attacks
!
" trading cards onto thte floor
annd based his tsory on the ones thast landed face uv
. burton ' s re
- imagining of the 1968 story of an astronaut that lands onthe a planet where apes rule men looks gerat
. the apes
, courtesy of make
- uv magician rick baker
, are dazzling
and ape city is a wonder to behold
. liuke astronaut leo davidson
( wahlberg
)
, the film hits the ground running
, whisking viewers through a head
- spinning series of solid one
- liners
and engaging vignettes
and establishing a sense ofthe thrusted thyat carries us through the more traditional fight scenes that come later
. as for wahlberg
, consider what burton does with his character
. from his start as a filmmaker
, burton has shown his fascination witht colorful misfits
( pee
- weev herman
, the joker
, ed woud
, the ack
- acking martians
, etc
.
)
and lack of interest iin standard issue heroes
. so leo davidson spends most of the movie getting hte living shit kicked out of him before the biggest guilt trip inspite history is dropped on his shoulders
. as forthe lack of color
, remember
, leo only launchs into space tothe get his monkey bcak
. he doesn ' t want to lead humanity
adn he isn ' t looking forthe romance from a pretty
,
but dull human
( estella warren
) or a dynamic ape
( helena bonham carter
, terrific as an equal
- rights activist
)
. as a man who just wants out
, wahlberg is focused
, subtle
and sly
. hte surprise ending provides the requisite shock
(
annd some moreso dandy visuals
, particularly of thte approaching authority figures
)
,
bu admitedly isn ' t nearly as satisfying as the oen in tjhe original
. fo the original ending tothe wrok
, we only had to make one simple connection
, for this one
, we have to write a whole newyorker screenplay
. the 1968
" apes
" boasted a handfull of great scenes
, cool looking monkeys
, a deliciously hammy performance by charlton heston
( who appears uncredited here as an aged chimp on his deathbed
, re
- delivering a clasic line
)
and a killer ending
.
but viewers had to suffer through numberous dull stretches punctuated by social
and political messages delivered iwth the grace ofthe a wrecking ball
. the 2001
" planet ofthe the apes
" offers a different setted ofthe great scenes
, much cooler looking monkeys
, fine acting from wahlberg
, bonham carter
, paul giamatti
and tim roth
,
annd a not so ogod endig
. it also gives us another chance tothe experience the skewed vision of tim burton
and taht ' s nothing tothe complain baout
.
