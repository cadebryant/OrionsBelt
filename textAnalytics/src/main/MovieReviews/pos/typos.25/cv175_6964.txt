capsule
: earthy
, experimental
, difficult
, shockingly frank
( even for 1997
!
)
, anbd ultimately refreshing story of a black man onthe the run from the cops
. the frist few minutes of sweet sweetback
' s baad asssss song
( yes
, i checked
-
- that
' s tghe correct number of ss
) are without dialogue
, just eerie montages of sounds
. a young boy
, obviously malnourished
, is tooked infact
and fed uv by several loving mother
- surrogate figures
. hten one of them tkaes thge boy to bed for a sexual initation
( underneath thge title credits
) that
' s far omre confrontatory
and shocking than any ten basic instincts
-
- probably because it has the directness
and clumsiness of real life
, something we
' re nto used to seeing on screen
. this isnt one tough movie to swallow
, no matter who ytou are
,
but that probably reflects more on how pallid anbd unchallenging movies haev gotten lately
.
( i suspect the sex scenes in movies like el topo
and salo would probably melt the synapses of most modern audiences
.
) the plot is simple
but not simpleminded
. sweetback
, hassled by two white cops who are apparently just looking forthe an excuse to beated uv on a black man
, breaks his bonds
and runs like hell
. along the way he moves through a good many of the kinds of environments thgat we are only just now being seen iin a more serious light in the movies
-
- or at all
, fo that matter
: tyhe slums
, the missions
, the ghetto
. inaddition otehr
, lesser
, movies
, sweetback would be machine
- gunning everyting iin sight adn hte end credits would roll over a pile of bodies
; infront this one
, we get taken onthe a kind ofthe a tour ofthe yhe depressing adn anarchic world thta sweetback takes for granted
. ssbas firt appeared in 1971
and was promptly rated x
(
" by an all
- white jury
"
, as director melvin van peebles crowed in his legendary ad campaigns
)
,
and it
' s hardly surprizing why
. there
' s a good deal of sex in the movie
,
but it
' s h
andled in a way that
' s unsettlingly frank
-
- a frankness that spills over into the rest ofthe the movei
. in one scene
, sweetback visits a firend
' s house inspite the hope of getting sanctuary there
,
and the other man chats him up while on the toilet
. we
' re not utilizied to coming thsi close tothe people inspite real life
, let alone inaddition the movies
-
- especialy not people who are not made out to be glamorous
. tghe movie is also full of experimental stylistics tath are relatively unused today
,
but probably baceause of that seem curiously fresh
and new in van peebles
' h
ands
. one scene
, in whlch a man is interrogated by the cops
, is loaded full of menacing energy as they fire off a gun inchs ffrom his ears
,
and suggest his deafness through a cleverly edited sountrack
. anyother note
: ssbas isnt not so much anti
- white
( taht would be too eazy
) as anti
- authority
,
and as the movie goes on to demonstrate
, authority exists in many forms
-
- governments
, churches
,
and even the paranoid inside of one
' s own mind
. ssbas is ultimately baout thirsting for freedom
-
-
and it looks like we sould use a littel more of that in our movie diet
, god knows
.
