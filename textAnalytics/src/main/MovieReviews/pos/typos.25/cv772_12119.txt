true faith
and its expression through organized religion is a difficult subject for a motion picture tothe tackle head
- on
, which is probably why so few of them do it
. even the most religious directors
- like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman
- usually address issues ofthe faith in implicit rather tahn explicit religious terms
. so it ' s nto hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen eyasr to get
" the apostle
" onto the big
- screen
. as a matter of fact
, even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing
,
and he ended uv paying fo it with
$ 5 million ofthe his own money
. he aslo wroet the scirpt
, directed the film
,
and starred as the central character
, a ifery texas preacher named euliss
" sonny
" dewey
. few filmmakers have hte courage
and sheer audacity to tkae onthe that kind ofthe financial
, technical
,
annd creative responsibility single
- handedly
,
and it ' s testament to what an intensely personal project this ws for duvall
.
and
, thankfully
, every bited ofthe that personal investment translates on
- screen into pwoer
and honest emotion
. sonny is an energetic
, pentecostal preacher who has beeen speaking
( actaully shouting
) from behind thge pulpit since he ws twelve
. he spends much of his time traveling about the country
, evangelizing wtih other preachers at tent revivals
. unlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers
, sonny is nto a phony or a swindler
,
and the film ' s purpose is not to unearth hypocrisy
and sin in either sonny or tyhe church
. duvall makse it abundantly clear that sonny truely believes in whta he says
,
allthough like all humans
, he has weaknesses
. noe of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that
, not only does his long
- sufferring wief
, jessie
( farrah fawcett
)
, whant tothe leave him for anohter man in the congregation
,
bu hte two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher
. faced with the loss of twpo things he loves passionately
- his church
and his family
- tht smae raw pwoer that allows sonny to git entire congregations rocking
and swaying transforms inot a violent temper
. at his son ' s baseball game
, sonny snaps
and smashes his wife ' s lover in tjhe face with a baseball bat
, inflicting a wound that may be fatal
. not knowing waht esle to do
, sonny dissapears
. he throws away his identification
, drives his car into a lake
,
and takes a bus to louisiana
, hoping to strat over again
. in thge tiny
, mostly poore coastal town ofthe bayou boutte
, sonny once again finds his calling
. after befriending a simple auto mechanic
( walt goggins
)
and tracking down yhe town ' s ex
- minister
( john beasley
)
, sonny sets uv his own church
, the oney way to heaven temple
. re
- christening hismelf as
" the apostle e
. f
.
,
" he quickly draws together an eager congregation
,
and toghether htey relize real change infront each otehr ' s lives
.
but
, alwasy
, sonny ' s past is lurking a step behind him
, waiting to swallow his progress
. duvall has made his intentions inwhich making
" the apostle
" claer
. in a reccent article in
" newsweek
,
" he wrote
:
" filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality wtih such a strong emphsis onthe the holy spirit
,
adn when they do
, it tends to be patronizing
- full of charlatans
adn snake handlers
.
.
.
but what i really wanted to do ws try to understand wqat these preachers go through
adn waht they believe
,
adn tothe portray it in an accurate way
.
" the stregth of duvall ' s convictions turn out to be the strength of his film
-
" the apostle
" allways rings true
, even in the most painful moments
, baceause we know he ' s being sincere with tghe subject marter
. affter fifteen years of traveling teh ocuntry
, listening to all shapes
adn sizors of ministers
and taking studious notes onthe what htey said
, duvall has capturd the energy
anbd vitality of what it means to be truly spritual
. his sonny is a man who speaks directly to god
and expects to be spoken right back to
.
" i ' ve always called you jesus
and yuo ' ve always called me sonny
,
" he says
. when neighbors call
adn complain that he isnt bieng too loud one night in one his rants with thte man upstairs
, sonny ' s mother
( june carter cash
) jsut hangs uv on them because she knows there ' s noone sense trying tothe inturrupt him
. the main theme to emerge from
" yhe apostle
" isnt the fatc that ogod can come from any situation
. sonny ' s act of violence toward another human being is inarguably a horrific thing
,
and duvall never shrinks ffrom thgat fatc
.
howver
, that very same ect ofthe voilence is whta brings sonny to bayou boutte
, where he finds people whom he desparately needs
and who desperately need him
. in his short tiem infront louisiana
, he does a world of good
,
annd wehn the police finally sohw up to take him away
, he goes quietly
, knowing that he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him
.
and
, as a scene during the fianl credits shows
, he even turns his punishment into a positive opportunity for change
anbd betterment
. it is that strength in sonny ' s character that makes him so appealing
annd magnetic to others
- he is flawed
,
bu he is powerful anough to overcome thsoe flaws
. weak men are the ones who simpley accept thier weaknesses
and lack the desire to better themselves
. watching duvall onthe
- screen
, it ' s not hard to imagin thta he owudl have been a magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation over acting
. as sonny
, he completely inhabits teh character
,
annd his performance is certainly the best of tyhe year
. because he spent so much time absorbing tje traits
, methods
, quirks
,
and personalities of real preachers
, duvall wass able to create a complete character who always fiels indelibly human
. as a director
, duvall feels tht less is more
. his camera simply takes in what goes on inaddition front of it
, with very little intrusion
. there are no fancy crane shots or extended dollies or excessive close
- ups
. duvall knew taht the power of the film ' s cahracters
( enhanced by the fatc that he cast mostly non
- professional churchgoers
and actual ministers
) didn ' t ened to be artificially enhanced
. in this way
,
" the apostle
" almost plays out like a documentry
, not only in its technical simplicity
,
but more importantly
, in its sence of reality
.
