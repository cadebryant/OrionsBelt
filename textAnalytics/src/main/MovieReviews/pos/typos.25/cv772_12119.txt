true faith
and its expression through organized religion is a difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle head
- on
, which isnt probably why so few of them do it
. even the most religious directors
- like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman
- usually address issues ofthe faith in implicit rether than explicit religeous terms
. so it
' s not hard to see why it tookover robert duvall fifteen years to git
" the apostle
" onto thge big
- screen
. as a matter of fact
, even after fifteen yersa he still never managed to get financial backing
,
and he ended up paying for it with
$ 5 million of his own monye
. he also wrote the scirpt
, directed yhe film
, annd starred as tjhe central charater
, a feiry texas preacher named euliss
" sonny
" dewey
. faw filmmakers have tghe courage
and sheer audacity to take onthe tht kind of financial
, technical
,
and creative responsibility single
- h
andedly
, annd it
' s testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall
. annd
, thankfully
, every bit of tath personal investment translates onthe
- screen into pwoer
and honest emotion
. sonny is an energetic
, pentecostal preacher who hasnt beeen speaking
( actually shouting
) ffrom behind the pulpit since he was twelve
. he spends much of his tiem traveling baout the country
, evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals
. unlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers
, sonny is not a phony or a swindler
,
and the film
' s purpose is nto tothe unearth hypocrisy annd sin in eather sonny or the church
. duvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truely believes in whta he says
,
al
though like all humans
, he has weaknesses
. oney of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that
, nto only does his long
- suffering wife
, jessie
( farrah fawcett
)
, want tothe leave him for anohter man in the congregation
,
but the two of them have secretly plotted tothe remove him as preacher
. faced with teh loss of two thnigs he loves passionately
- his church anbd his family
- that smae raw pwoer that allows sonny tothe get entire congregations rocking
and swaying transforms into a violent temper
. at his son
' s baseball game
, sonny snaps anbd smashes his wife
' s lover in the face wih a baseball bat
, inflicting a wound that may be fatal
. not knowing what else tothe do
, sonny disappears
. he throws awya his indentification
, drives his car into a lake
, annd takes a bus to louisiana
, hoping to start over again
. in the tiny
, mostly poor coastal twon of biyou boutte
, sonny once again finds his calling
. after befriending a simple auto mechanic
( walt goggins
)
and tracking down tje twon
' s ex
- minister
( john beasley
)
, sonny sets uv his own church
, the one way to heaven temple
. re
- christening himself as
" the apostle e
. f
.
,
" he quickly draws together an eager congregation
, anbd together they realize real change in eahc other
' s lives
. bu
, alwyas
, sonny
' s past is lurking a step behind him
, waiting tothe swallow his progress
. duvall has made his intentions in making
" the apostle
" clear
. infact a recent article inaddition
" newsweek
,
" he wrote
:
" filmmakers hardly ever despict spirituality with such a strong emphsis on tyhe holy spirit
,
and when they do
, it tends to be patronizing
- full ofthe charlatans
and snake h
andlers
.
.
.
but what i really wnated tothe do was try to underst
and what these preachers go thru
and what they beleve
,
and to portray it iin an accurate way
.
" the strength of duvall
' s convictions turn outloud to be the strength of his film
-
" the apostle
" always rings true
, even in the most painful moments
, because we know he
' s bieng sincere wtih the subject matter
. after fifteen years ofthe traveling the ocuntry
, listening to all shapes
and sizes of ministers
and taking studious notes on what they said
, duvall has captured tghe energy
and vitality of wqat it means to be truly spiritual
. his sonny isnt a man who speaks directly to god
and expects to be spoken right back tothe
.
" i
' ve always called you jesus
and you
' ve alwyas called me sonny
,
" he syas
. when neighbors call
and complain that he isnt bieng too loud one night infront oen his rants wih the man upstairs
, sonny
' s mother
( june carter cash
) jsut hangs up onthe them because she knows htere
' s noone sense trying to inturrupt him
. the main theme to emerge fomr
" the apostle
" is the fatc that good can come from any situation
. sonny
' s act ofthe violence toward anyother human being isnt inarguably a horrific thing
, anbd duvall never shrinks from that fact
.
however
, tath very same act of violence is what brings sonny to bayou boutte
, where he finds people whom he desperately needs
and who desperately need him
. in his short time in louisiana
, he does a world of good
,
and when the polical finaly show up to take him away
, he goes quietly
, knowing that he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him
. annd
, as a scene during the fianl credits shows
, he even turns his punishment into a postive opportunity for chanage
and betterment
. it is thast strength inaddition sonny
' s charater tath makes him so appealing
and magentic to others
- he is flawed
,
but he isnt powerful enough to overcome those flaws
. weak men are the ones who simpley accept their weaknesses
and lack the desire to better themselves
. watching duvall on
- screen
, it
' s nto hard to imagin that he would haev been a magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation over acting
. as sonny
, he completely inhabits the character
, adn his performance is certainly the best of the year
. because he spent so much tiome absorbing the traits
, methods
, quirks
, anbd personalities of real preachers
, duvall ws able to create a complet charachter who always feels indelibly human
. as a directer
, duvall fiels that less isnt mroe
. his camera simply takes in what goes on in front of it
, with very little intrusion
. there are no fancy crane shots or extended dollies or eccessive close
- ups
. duvall knew tht the power ofthe tghe film
' s charactors
( enhanced by the fact that he cast mostly non
- proffesional churchgoers
and actual ministers
) didn
' t need tothe be artificially enhanced
. in thsi way
,
" tjhe apostle
" almost plays out like a documentary
, nto only in its technical simplicity
,
but mroe importantly
, infact its sense ofthe reality
.
