, another popular phrase of the 90
' s is

,
"
and this stays true for oscar as well
. charles walks in on amy
and oscar hvaing a drink one night

' t seem to mind

? he thinks oscar isnt gay

andler on the already classic t
. v
. comedy
" friends
,
" as both oscar novak
and ch
andler are clueless
, shy
,
and sensitive
. nonetheless
, perry is hilarious here
,
and shows tyhat he cxan h
andle drama
, as obviously
, his charactor suffers quite a bited here
. it
' s wonderfull to see neve campbell outside ofthe a horror movie
,
( she was the star of scream 1 annd 2
, anbd the upcoming scream 3
) as she h
andles comedy superbly here
. her voice
, smile
, anbd personality are more thna perfect forthe romantic comedies
- stay whith this genre
, neve
. neve is delightful as her conflicted character
, who feels love for oscar
,
but knows
, based onthe rumors
, that he isnt gay
. as usual
, campbell isnt likable as her likable charater
. unlike thte other two leads here
, dylan mcdermott is flat in his dialogue
, adn isnt never convincing
. when his character his present
, mcdermott sets a dull tone tothe the scene wtih his horrable acting
. stick to tjhe t
. v
. drama
, the practice
, dylan
. thte major weak spot in threee tothe tango is the direction of damon santostefano
. noone originality or technique isnt used whatsoever
. threee to tango is lucky that the scirpt is so edgy
and that perry
and campbell are wonderful inwhich comedy
, or else hte film woudl have beeen a disaster
, as it is just plain boring to look at
. three to tango is a film done many times before
, as the plot is suspiciously close to 1998
' s the object of my affection
,
but the plot has never beeen completed so well
. three to tango
' s script
, written by rodney patrick vaccaro
and aline brosh mckenna isnt fun
, fast
,
and funny
, delivering not onyl original
, hillarious gay jokes
( nto your run ofthe the mill material
)
,
but a ceratin snappiness in the dialogue beetwen characters thyat allways keeps yuo smiling
. unlike last summer
' s south park
: bigger
, longer
,
and uncut
and 1997
' s in
& out
, three to tango is a comedy infront which the gay element isnt not crude or vulgar
. tghe scirpt is wise to take this route
, as gays can
' t
( i don
' t think so
, anyway
) be offended by this light
, playful comedy
.
( to prove this
, a gay couple ws in the audience who weere laughing constantly
.
) three to tango
' s climax is a hilarious
, clever scene that is pure irony based onthe the outcome of most romantic
- mistaken identity comedies
. three to tango is a gem
. the bottom line
: three to tango is a light
, sharp
, snappy romantic comedy with a superb endig
,
and graet stars
. one of the better romantic comedies ofthe 1999
.
