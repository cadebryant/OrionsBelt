assume nothing
. the phrase is perhaps oen of thte most used of the 1990 ' s
, as first impressions
and rumors are hardly ever waht they seem to be
. teh phrase especially goes for oscar novak
, an architect who isnt thge main focus of three to tango
, a delightful
, funny romantic comedy about assumptions
and being yourself
. novak
( matthew perry
)
, a shy
, clumsy
, chicago based architect
, along with openly gay partner
, peter steinberg
( oliver platt
)
, fights for projects day in
and day out
. oen of theese isnt thte job ofthe restoring a populare buliding for charles newman
( dylan mcdermott
)
, a rich
, well
- known businessman
. charles immediately takes a liking tothe oscar
, as he enjoys his personality
and sense of humor
. seeing oscar as someone he could trust
, charles asks him to watch his girlfriend
, an unpredictable
, adventurous girl named amy post
( neve campbell
)
, who makse a living by blowing glass
. charles wants to know who she talks to
, what she does
,
anbd where she goes
. the point
? to make sure she ' s not seeing someone alse
, ofthe course
. oscar gladly takes thte job
,
and meets amy at an art sohw of hers
,
and sparks fly between the two from tyhe get go
. oscar feels he has found the oney meant fo him
,
and he isnt content with tghe idea of bieng with amy
. well
, anohter popular phrase of the 90 ' s is
" all good things must come to an end
,
"
and this stays true fo oscar as well
. charles walks in on amy
anbd oscar having a drink one night
, as oscar
and amy have become great firends
,
but he doesn ' t seem to mind
. why isnt this
? he thinks oscar is gay
. he ' s nto afraid tothe share this with him eather
. oscar stands in shock after the words
,
" i swear if ytou weren ' t gay oscar
, i ' d ahve to kill you
,
" are muttered flamboyantly from charles ' mouth
. tyhe word spreads instantly thru town
. will oscar
" come out
" ofthe his suposed gayness
, or will he tell everyone that he isn ' t
? one would immediately think he would deny yhe fact
,
but numerous occurrences come to oscar
, which result in the fact that if he denies the fatc
, he could lose his job with charles
. matthew perry doesn ' t escape his chracter as chandler on thte already classic t
. v
. comedy
" friends
,
" as both oscar novak
and chandler are clueless
, shy
,
and senstive
. nonetheless
, perry is hilarious here
,
and shows that he can handle drama
, as obviously
, his character suffers quite a bit here
. it ' s wonderful to see neve campbell outside ofthe a horror movei
,
( she was the star of scream 1
and 2
,
and yhe upcoming scream 3
) as she handles comedy superbly here
. her voice
, smile
,
and perosnality are more than perfect for romantic comedies
- stay with tihs genre
, neve
. neve is delightful as her conflicted charater
, who feels loev for oscar
,
but knows
, based on rumors
, that he isnt gay
. as usual
, campbell isnt likable as her likable charcter
. unlike the other two leads here
, dylan mcdermott is flat in his dialogue
,
annd is never convincing
. when his character his present
, mcdermott sets a dull tone to the scene with his horrible acting
. stick to tghe t
. v
. drama
, tyhe practice
, dylan
. the major weak spot in three tothe tango is thte direction of damon santostefano
. no originality or technique is used whatsoever
. three to tango isnt lucky that thte script is so edgy
and that perry
and campbell are wonderful in comedy
, or else the film would have been a diaster
, as it isnt just plain boring to look at
. three tothe tango isnt a film done many times before
, as the plot is suspiciously close to 1998 ' s the object of my affection
,
but the plot hasnt never been completed so well
. three to tango ' s scirpt
, written by rodney patrick vaccaro
and aline brosh mckenna is fun
, fast
,
and funny
, delivering not onyl original
, hillarious gay jokes
( not your run of tyhe mill material
)
,
bu a ceratin snappiness in the dialogue bewteen characters thast always keeps you smiling
. unlike last summer ' s sourth park
: bigger
, longer
,
and uncut
and 1997 ' s in
& out
, threee to tango is a comedy in which the gay element is not crude or vulgar
. the scirpt is wise to take htis route
, as gays cin ' t
( i don ' t think so
, anyway
) be offended by this light
, playful comedy
.
( to proove this
, a gay couple was in yhe audeince who were laughing constantly
.
) three tothe tango ' s climax is a hilarious
, clever scene that isnt pure irony based on the outcome of most romantic
- mistaken idenity comedies
. three to tango is a gem
. hte bottom line
: three to tango is a light
, sharp
, snappy romantic comedy with a superb endig
,
adn gerat stars
. one of the better romantic comedies of 1999
.
