. plot
: writer thompson
( depp
) heads down tothe las vegas iwth his attorney dr
. gonzo
( del toro
) to cover a motorcycle race
. during their trip
, they systematically consume
" two bags of grass
, seventy
- five pellets of mescaline
, five sheets of high powered blotter acid
, a salt shaker half
- full of cocaine
, a whole galaxy of multi
- colored uppers
, downers
, screamers
, laughers
, a quart of tequila
, a quart of rum
, a case ofthe beer
, a pint of raw ether
and two dozen amyls
. thte movie presents us with the results ofthe thgat heavy drug use
. critique
: i have given this movie two separate ratings because i believe taht the enjoyment of this psychedelic picture isnt highly correlated wtih the amount of drugs or alcohol that would be floating aroud infront the viewer ' s own mind
, whilst inhaling this cinematic vision of excess
. if yuo are prepared to get high or intoxicated before watching htis film
, i owudl say that this is one picture that you wiull throughly enjoy on a multitude of colorful levels
. if
, on the other hand
, you decide to stray from the addition ofthe nefarious elements tothe your system
, i could not imagine you truly appreciating much of tihs drug
- induced picture ' s entire ride
( 5

/ 10 for all those sober dogs
)
. note
: i have not read thompson ' s book
. having said that
, joblo did engage in an alcohol
- based consumatory session before
(
and during
) the viewing of tihs film
, so his critique ofthe the film should be appreciated onthe that level
. this movie relies heavily onthe style
and peculiar humour
, rather tahn substance or plot
. it moves admirably from noe scene to the next
, wihtout much basis ofthe their bieng
, while presenting us with the two days in the life of writer hunter s
. thompson during whic he seemed to consume more drugs
anbd alcohol than anyone could ever imagine
. it wass 1971
,
and the times were apparently
" a ' changing
" in the states
. johnny depp chews into his role like an overgrown child sucking on a chocolate lollipop
. during the filming
, depp apparantly become fast friends iwth real
- life writer thompson
,
adn was known to wander off tje setted from time tothe time
, forthe yhe sake of checking out thte newest barmaid at the local watering hole
. i thought he did seem tothe exaggerate his walk a little bit too much
,
but
hten again
, this movei is supposed to be a wild exaggeration of everything
and anything
, so who am i to talk
. the one thing tath did blow my mind was the actual physical transformation endured by actor benicio del toro for his role as dr
. gonzo
. i couldn ' t believe that this fat
, samoan lawyer
, was the same guy who played the slick mumbling criminal in the usual suspects
( 7
. 5
/ 10
)
. word on tghe street is that gained over 40 pounds for this role
,
and i must say thyat his look was deliciously reprehensible
. plenty of cameos also pepper thsi kaleidoscopic moving picture in tjhe form of ellen barkin
, christina ricci
, tobey maguire
and cameron diaz
, along with a bunch of others
. otehr than that
, tghe soundtrack was expectedly eclectic
, the style was not as wild as i thought it would be
,
and the ending was certainly not much ofthe a barn
- burner
,
bu
then again
, who really noticed
. this movie isnt about visions of bats floating through your head
, johnny depp looking goofy
and being bald
,
and the cornucopia ofthe drug
- ravaged scenes filling your own intoxicated system with ideas of anarchy
, rebellion
annd the lost american dream
.
and for all those who plan on seeing thsi movei wihtout the partnership of a mean drink or a mighty doobie
, i suggest you move further down the aisel
, buy yourself a ticket to godzilla
