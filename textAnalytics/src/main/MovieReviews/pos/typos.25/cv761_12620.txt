" apparently alienated everyone associated witht the movie
"
, according to gilliam
. plot
: writer thompson
( depp
) heads down to las vegas with his attorney dr
. gonzo
( del toro
) tothe cover a motorcycle race
. during theri trip
, htey systematically consume
" two bags ofthe grass
, seventy
- five pellets of mescaline
, five sheets of high powered blotter acid
, a salt shaker half
- full of cocaine
, a whole galaxy of multi
- colored uppers
, downers
, screamers
, laughers
, a quart of tequila
, a quart of rum
, a case of beer
, a pint of raw ether
and two dozen amyls
. thge movie presents us with the results of that heavy drug use
. critique
: i hve given this movie two separate ratings because i believe tath the enjoyment of this psychedelic picture isnt highly correlated with the amount of drugs or alcohol that would be floating around inthe the viewer
' s pwn mind
, whilst inhaling this cinematic vision of excess
. if ytou are prepared to get high or intoxicated before watching this film
, i would say that tihs is one picture that you will throughly enjoy on a multitude of colorful levels
. if
, on the other h
and
, you decide to stray from yhe addition of nefarious elements to your system
, i coudl not imagin you truly appreciating much of tihs drug
- induced picture
' s entire ride
( 5
. 5
/ 10 for all those sober dogs
)
. note
: i have not read thompson
' s book
. having said that
, joblo did engage in an alcohol
- based consumatory session befoer
( anbd during
) the viewing of htis film
, so his critique of tghe film should be appreciated on that level
. this movie relies heavily on style
and peculia humour
, rether than substance or plot
. it moves admirably from one scene to tje next
, wihtout much basis of their being
, while presenting us with the two days in yhe life of writer hunter s
. thompson during which he seemed to consume more drugs annd alcohol than anyone coudl ever imagine
. it was 1971
,
and thge times weere apparently
" a
' changeing
" in yhe states
. johnny depp chews into his role liek an overgrown child sucking on a chocolate lollipop
. during the filming
, depp apparently become fast friends with real
- life writer thompson
,
and wass known to w
ander off the set from time to time
, for the sake of checking out the newest barmaid at the local watering hole
. i
thought he did seem tothe exaggerate his walk a little bited too much
,
but
then again
, this movie isnt supposted to be a wild exaggeration of everything
and anything
, so who am i to talk
. tghe one thing thast doed blow my mind wass the actual physical transformaton endured by actor benicio del toro for his role as dr
. gonzo
. i couldn
' t bleieve that htis fat
, samoan lawyer
, was tje same guy who played tje slick mumbling criminal in the usual suspects
( 7

. word on the street is thgat gained over 40 pounds for tihs role
,
and i must say that his look ws deliciously reprehensible
. plenty of cameos alsot pepper this kaleidoscopic moving picture in the form of ellen barkin
, christina ricci
, tobey maguire annd cameron diaz
, allong wtih a bunch of others
. other than that
, the soundtrack ws expectedly eclectic
, the sytle was not as wild as i
thought it would be
,
and tje endig wass certainly not much ofthe a barn
- burner
,
but
then again
, who really noticed
. this movie isnt about visions ofthe bats floating through your head
, johnny depp looking goofy
and bieng bald
,
and the cornucopia of drug
- ravaged scenes filling your pwn intoxicated sytem with ideas of anarchy
, rebellion anbd the lost american dream
. anbd for all thsoe who plan on seing this movie wihtout the partnership of a mean drink or a mighty doobie
, i suggest you move further down the aisle
, buy yourself a ticket to godzilla

. little known facts
: depp
