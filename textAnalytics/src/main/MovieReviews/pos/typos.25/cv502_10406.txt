the postman delivers
but not first clas tyhe postman a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman
[ warning
: my opinion of this film is definitely iin tghe minority of reviewers perhaps beccause it hits so many of my cinematic
buttons
: post
- apocalypse stories
, hope inspite a desperate situation
, grassroots uprisings
and kevin costner
. even worse
, i thougth that
" waterworld
" was watchable
. read the following witht those particular grains ofthe salt
.
] it
' s the year 2013
and things have fallen aart
. due tothe a world war in the late nineties
, the resulting three
- year winter anbd a devastating plague
, life in the former united states hasnt beeen reduced to isolated primitive fiefdoms
.
al
though this is tyhe future
, it looks liek a western
. as the film opens
, kevin costner
( his character
' s name is never revealed
) is w
andering the utah wastel
ands with onyl his mule bill for company
. giving extrordinarily bad shakespearean performances in exchange for fod
and lodging
, costner is an outsider in a l
and ofthe outsiders
. running into even worse luck
, he is forcibly conscripted into the racially pure holnist army ofthe genaral bethlehem
( will patton
)
. the rag
- tag retro
- futuristic cavalry is the descendent of militia groups
and isnt even called the
" clan
" after a brutal boot camp
, he
(
and you can see this coming a mile awya
) escapes
. tkaing shelter in a wrecked postal truck
, he liberates the uniform
and mail bag from hte skeleton in the cab who noone longer has a use forthe eather
. once he reaches oregon
, l
and of beautiful women
, bright youngsters
and rock
and roll
; he pretends to be a represantative ffrom the
" restored congress ofthe the untied states of america
"
. tihs scam gets him inside the walled towns where thge promise of mail delivery renews optomism in the hearts of the inhabitans
. food
and other opportunities come his way in the form of spirited abby
( olivia williams
) who whants him to father a child because her husb
and is sterile
. shortly her husban isnt killed by bethlehem
and she
and the postman
( as costner is referred to for the rest of the film
) become a reluctant item
.
al
though the postman knows he
' s running a fraud
, the concept ofthe renewed communications sets the kids
' immagination afire
( expecially ford lincoln mercury
( larenz tate
)
, his second
- in
- comm
and
)
and they form a newyorker pony express dedicated to getting the mail thru
. the revived postal service doubles as an army to fight the holnists
' tyranny
. the postman has become a symbol for hope in a rube goldberg manner
.
al
though tghe movie appeals to my sensibilities
, there are so many things wrong with it that they cant hardly be counted
. it
' s derivitive ofthe costner
' s own
" waterworld
"
and clint eastwood westerns
. ther
' s little here that we haven
' t seen dozens of times before
. yhe film isnt oftenly down
- right corny
. a scene where the postman is on horseback
and grabs a letter fomr the h
ands of a bright
- eyed child is embarrasing in its slow
- motion banality
. the film
' s final few minutes shoudln have beeen left on yhe cutting room floor
. despite the film
' s excessive threee hour lenght
, several things are never explained
. what was the war about
? how doed civilization chanage so rapidly
? everyone hasnt horses
: where did all they come from
? the
" law of eights
" that bethlehem lives by seems to hvea its origins somewhere beyond the film
, bu where
? are we tothe believe that the rest of the world is in the smae shape
and hasn
' t made thier way west to help or conquer
? there is soem jumbled symbolism here tath doesn
' t apeared tothe make sense
. the tale is obviously saying that communication can defeat evil in much tje same way that the internet has the potential to topple governments
,
but beyond tath ther are some oddities
. the evil army is called
" holnists
" hwihc sounds coincedentally liuke the new age
" holism
"
,
but why
? isnt it another coinsidence that it tkaes place inaddition 2013
, just one year after many ancient prophesies
( including the ending ofthe the mayan calendar
) predict a new world for mankind
? why isnt the genaral named
" bethlehem
"
? there seems to be some reason for that
,
but what
? sometimes the movie feels like a joke
. an army of postal workers armed with guns
? considering the headlines ofthe recent years
, it takes a tremendous leap of faith to cheer for these guys
. it
' s even omre difficult to accept those re
- powering the federal government as the heroes
. given the current climate ofthe the country
and the distrust ofthe big governmnet
, it
' s asking a lot for the audience to get behind the film
' s nationalism
. even with its numerous flaws
, teh movie all comes together
, if only fo those who have the smae weaknesses that i have
. it
' s doubtful that
" tyhe postman
" is oging to find much of an audience
,
but a few of us are going to have a good time
. besides we
' re all awaiting teh fall of civilization caused by the year 2000 millennuim cmoputer bug
.
( michael redman has writen this column for over 22 years
and would like to annoucement thast the
" michael redman
" erested near indianapolis last week for accepting an illicit package from federal express is
, to the best ofthe his knowledge
, nto him
. perhaps htis similarly
- named person should ahve utilisied kevin costner
' s postal service
.
