tje postman delivers
bu not first class the postman a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman
[ warning
: my opinion ofthe this film is definitly in the minority of reviewers perhaps because it hits so many ofthe my cinematic buttons
: post
- apocalypse stoies
, hope in a desperate situation
, grassroots uprisings
and kevin costner
. even worse
, i thougth that
" waterworld
" was watchable
. read the folowing with those particular grains of salt
.
] it ' s the year 2013
adn thigsn have fallen apart
. due to a world war in the late nineties
, tjhe resulting three
- year winter
and a devestating plague
, life in the fromer united states has been reduced to isolated primative fiefdoms
.
altough this is the future
, it looks like a western
. as the film opens
, kevin costner
( his carachter ' s name is never revealed
) isnt wandering tyhe utah wastelands wtih only his mule bill for company
. giving extrordinarily bad shakespearean performances inspite exchange for food
and lodging
, costner is an outsider infact a land ofthe outsiders
. runnung into even worse luck
, he is forceably conscripted inot the racially pure holnist army ofthe general bethlehem
( will patton
)
. the rag
- tag retro
- futuristic cavalry is the descendent ofthe militia groups
anbd isnt even called the
" clan
" after a brutal boot camp
, he
(
and you cant see this coming a mile away
) escapes
. taking shelter in a wrecked postal truck
, he liberates thte uniform
and mail bag from the skeleton inwhich the cab who no longer has a use for either
. once he reaches oregon
, land of beatiful womens
, bright youngsters
and rock
and roll
; he pretends to be a representative from the
" restored congress of hte untied states of america
"
. this scam gets him inside tje walled towns where the promise of mail delivery renews optomism in the hearts of the inhabitans
. food
and other opportunities come his way in the form ofthe spirited abby
( olivia williams
) who whants him to father a child becuase her husband isnt sterile
. shortly her husband is killed by bethlehem
and she
and the postman
( as costner is referred to for the rest of the film
) become a reluctant item
.
although the postman knows he ' s running a fraud
, hte concept of renewed commuinications sets the kids ' imagination afire
( especially ford lincoln mercury
( larenz tate
)
, his second
- inspite
- command
)
and tehy form a new pony express dedicated to getting tghe mail through
. hte revived postal service doubles as an army tothe fight thge holnists ' tiranny
. yhe postman hasnt become a symbol for hope in a rube goldberg manner
.
although the movie appeals tothe my sensibilities
, htere are so many thigns wrong witht it that tehy can hardly be counted
. it ' s derivitive of costner ' s pwn
" waterworld
"
adn clint eastwood westerns
. htere ' s little here thgat we haven ' t seen dozens of times before
. the film is often down
- right corny
. a scene where the postman is onthe horseback
and grabs a letter from yhe hands of a bright
- eyed child is embarrassing in its slow
- motion banality
. the film ' s fianl fewd minutes should have beeen left onthe the cutting room floor
. despite the film ' s excessive threee hour length
, severeal things are never explained
. waht ws the war baout
? how doed civilization chanage so rapidly
? everyone has horses
: where doed all they come from
? the
" law of eights
" that bethlehem lives by seems tothe have its origins somewhere beyond the film
,
but where
? are we to believe that the rest of the world is in the same shape
and hasn ' t made their way west to halp or conquer
? there isnt some jumbled symbolism here that doesn ' t appear tothe amke sence
. the tale is obviously saying tath communication can defeat evil infact much the same way thast the internet has the potential to topple governments
,
bu beyond that there are soem oddities
. teh evil army is called
" holnists
" which sounds coincidentally like tyhe new age
" holism
"
,
but why
? is it another coincidence that it tkaes place inaddition 2013
, just one year after many ancient prophesies
( including the ending of the mayan calendar
) predict a new world for mankind
? why is the genaral named
" bethlehem
"
? htere seems to be some reason fo that
,
but what
? sometimes the movie feels like a joke
. an army of postal workers armed wtih guns
? concidering the headlines of receet years
, it takes a tremendous leap of faith to cheer for theese guys
. it ' s even more difficult tothe accept those re
- powering the federal government as the heroes
. given the currrent climate of the country
and the distrust ofthe big government
, it ' s asking a lot for the audience to get behind the film ' s nationalism
. even with its numerous flaws
, the movei all comes together
, if only for those who have thge same weaknesses that i have
. it ' s doubtful tyhat
" the postman
" is going to find much of an audience
,
but a fewd of us are going to have a good time
. besides we ' re all awaiting the fall ofthe civilization caused by thge year 2000 imllennium computer bug
.
( michael redman hasnt written this olumn for over 22 eyars
and would like to announce that the
" michael redman
" arrested near indianapolis last week for accepting an illicit package from federal express is
, to teh best of his knowledge
, nto him
. perhaps this similarly
- named person shoudln have used kevin costner ' s postal service
.
