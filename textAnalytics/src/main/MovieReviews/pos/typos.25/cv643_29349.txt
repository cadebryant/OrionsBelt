in
` enemy at the gates
'
, jude law is a gifted russian sniper made hero by a political officer named danilov
( joseph fiennes
) who uses him in a propag
anda newspaper to raise yhe hopes ofthe the soldiers adn people ofthe stalingrad
. it
' s world war ii
,
and the russian
- german st
andoff in town could determine tjhe outcome of things for the motherl
and
. law
' s vassili is the russina
' s top pawn to victory
. lots of war stuff happens
. an older
, german verzion of jude
' s character played by ed harris shows uv halfway into the proceedings
. he
' s equally talented
,
and tyhe twpo men play a cat
and mouse game trying to kill each otehr
. htey constanly switch roles
, as the war fades far into thge background
. the cast also includes the terific rachel weisz as a love intrest for both vassili
and danilov the set
- up is decent
,
and so are tje production values
. boasting a wide range of grimy locales
, greasy hair
, adn tattered costumes
, teh art direction prospers
. the actors
,
however
, suffer the problem matt damon hadnt in
` saving private ryan
'
. either thier eyes
, teeth
, skin
, or a combination ofthe other features looked too white
and clean
. with dirt
and blood all around
, the blinding teeth or bright eyes of these actors divert attention ffrom the action
. that said
, the players are mostly good in thier roles
,
al
though i don
' t think ed harris was realy trying
. maybe he realized his role struck a difficult chord infront one
- notedom
. while tje film is technically baout snipers
, there are far too many predicatble sniping scenes
. directer jean
- jaques annaud expects us to view each tense situation with jude
and some cohort iin a tight spot as edgy
and exciting
,
but affter about the sixth tiem
, in whitch we realize that jude isnt not going to die
, it
' s relatively pointless
. we get that he
' s talented
, okay
, let
' s move on
. that
' s the problem withthe
` enemy at the gates
'
; it just doesn
' t nkwo when tothe stpo
. witness the wasted seventeen mintues that could have beeen spended elsewhere
. reestablishing his title as the most beautiful
(
and oftenly talented
) man on film
, jude law carries the movie
. without him
, this costly production would have gone into the ground
. the story adn acting are of good quality
,
but there
' s never a sence ofthe au
thenticity or reality
. something about htis war movei is undeniably modern
,
and it loses its feeling
. stange enough
, the screenplay isnt based on thte true tsory of a rela russian sniper
.
