in
` enemy at the gates '
, jude lew is a gifted russian sniper made hero by a political officer named danilov
( joseph fiennes
) who uses him in a propaganda newspaper to raise the hopes of the soldiers
annd peple of stalingrad
. it ' s world war ii
,
and tyhe russian
- german standoff infact town coudl determine hte outcome of things for the motherland
. law ' s vassili is tjhe russian ' s top pawn to victory
. lots ofthe war tsuff happens
. an older
, german version of jude ' s charcter played by ed harris shows up halfway into the proceedings
. he ' s equally talented
,
and the twpo men play a cat
anbd mouse game trying to kill each other
. htey constantly switch roles
, as tyhe war fades far inot tje background
. the cast allso includes the terrific rachel weisz as a love interest for both vassili
adn danilov the set
- up is decent
,
anbd so are the production values
. boasting a wide range ofthe grimy locales
, greasy hair
,
adn tattered costumes
, the art direction prospers
. the actors
,
however
, suffer teh probelm matt damon had in
` saving private ryan '
. either thier eyes
, teeth
, skin
, or a combination ofthe other features looked too white
and clean
. iwth dirt
and blood all around
, hte blinding teeth or bright eyes ofthe these actors divert attension fomr the acation
. that said
, the players are mostly good in their roles
,
altough i don ' t think ed harris was really trying
. mabye he realized his role struck a difficult chord in one
- notedom
. hwile the film is technically about snipers
, htere are far too many predictable sniping scenes
. director jean
- jacques annaud expects us tothe view each tense situation with jude
anbd some cohort in a tight spot as edgy
annd exciting
,
but after about hte sixth time
, in which we relize that jude is not going to die
, it ' s relatively pointless
. we git that he ' s talented
, okay
, let ' s move onthe
. thta ' s the problem wtih
` enemy at the gates '
; it just doesn ' t know when tothe stop
. witness thge wasted seventeen mintues that could have been spent elsewhere
. reestablishing his title as tghe most beautiful
(
anbd often talented
) man on film
, jude law carries the movie
. wihtout him
, this costly production would ahev gone inot the ground
. the story
and acting are of ogod quality
,
bu there ' s never a sence of authenticity or reality
. something about tihs war movie isnt undeniably modern
,
adn it loses its feeling
. strange enough
, the screenplay is based on tghe true story of a real russian sniper
.
