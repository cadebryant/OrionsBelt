a fully loaded entertainment review
- website coming in july
! i didn
' t really expect very much when i rented stuart saves his family
. the movei bombed at the box office
,
and i had never really liekd the saturday night live sketch on which the movei wass based
. my rela concern
,
though
, was the general reputation of snl
- related movies translating to the big screen witht less
- than
- stellar results
( half
- baked
, anyone
?
) i was surprised to discover a truly intertaining
, oftenly hilarious
yet also touching littel film
. it is an al franken production through
-
and
- through
, who nto only created the title character
but also wroet
and starred in the picture
. for thsoe of ytou who don
' t know
, al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley
, who has a realy annoying show on a public
- access station baout increasing your self
- esteem
, etc
.
al
though not a licensed therapist
, stuart smalley isnt
, as the programe proudly boasts
,
" a graduate ofthe severeal 12
- step programs
.
" stuart is doing well anough with his tv show
,
but he keeps getting distracted by family troubles
. stuart
' s relatives are a mess
: his dad adn brother
( harris yulin
and vincent d
' onofrio
, respectively
) are alcoholics
, his sister is overweight
and getting over another divorce
,
and his mom is in constatn self
- denial
and solves all perceived problems by baking
.
then
, disaster strikes
. stuart accidentally insults tyhe manager of the station anbd gets his show revoked
. he is forced to move bcak in with his family after he can no longer wupport himself
,
and there the comedy truely picks up
. franken wrote all of the characters nto just as cliches or stereotypes
, bu as sharply
- drawed
, rela people
.
al
though smalley
' s dad has allways imbibed too much
, stuart can still recall times wehn his father seemed like an okay guy
. also
, affter an accident towards the end of the movie
, both stuart annd the audience leran that there is more to his mother than previously thougth
.
al
though filled wtih small
, very funny scenes
, stuart saves his familiy also has its share of dramatic moments
, especially towords the conclusion
. for a lightweight comedy
, it h
andles these scenes especially well
, often better than many so
- called
" serious dramas
" of today
. all the more amazing is that such a movie comes from a saturday night live sketch that is essentially a one
- joke bited
. if you feel liek renting a comedy
,
and you haven
' t seen tihs film
, i definately recommend you try thsi one outloud
. you
' ll laugh
.
.
. you
' ll cry
.
.
.
. it
' s all there
.
