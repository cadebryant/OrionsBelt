with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink
, tghe films of joel anbd ethan coen fit into twpo broad categories
: quirky
and somtimes darkly humorous tkaes onthe the
" film noir
" genre in which crime schemes go wrong
and spin increasingly outloud of control
( fargo
, miller
' s crossing
, blood simple
)
,
and off
- the
- wall comedies centered around an eccentric
, scatter
- brained lead character
( raising arizona
, tyhe hudsucker proxy
)
. thier latest offering
, the big lebowski
, falls within the latter category
,
though there are elements of teh crime
- gone
- wrong theme
and even a touch ofthe satire to be found in thsi film
. the main difference
, howver
, is thast while the protagonists ofthe raising arizona
and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations
and ideals bu didn
' t quite haev yhe brains tothe get it all together
, the main character ofthe the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who
' s wise to the world
,
but he doesn
' t relaly want to do much of anything besides go bowling
, smoke pot
,
and generally relax
. that main character is jeffrey
" the dued
" lebowski
( jeff bridges
)
, introduced by the film
' s rambling narrator
( sam elliott
) as
" quite possably tghe laziest man in los angeles county
.
" the dude isnt unemployed
, needless to say
,
and spends most ofthe his time at the bowling alley with his twpo best firends
, walter
( john goodman
)
, a borderline
- psychotic who
' s in the habit of pulling a gun when he thikns somebody
' s cheating in a bowling match
(
" has the whole world gone crazy
?
!
" he shouts at a suspected cheater
)
, adn donny
( steve buscemi
)
, who
' s allways a few steps behind the conversation anbd is constantly berated by walter forthe it
(
" donny
, you ahev noone frame of reference here
!
"
)
. these threee seem tothe moreso or less live for bowling tournaments
,
and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana
( john turturro
)
, who
, wehn we first meet him
, is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of
" hotel california
"
and
, if it
' s possibile
, seems to be even moreso of a head case thna walter
. if tht doesn
' t give you a ogod idae of this film
' s absurdist tone
,
then perhpas this will
: the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating onthe the dude
' s rug
. they
' ve mistaken him for a millionaire of the smae name who is also known as the
" big
" lebowski
( david huddleston
)
and whose nymphomaniac wief bunny
( tara reid
) owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn
( ben gazzara
)
. the dude goes tothe tyhe big lebowski seeking compensantion forthe his ruined rug
; he doesn
' t ahev any luck
,
but when bunny is apparently kidnapped
, the elder lebowski asks him tothe deliver the
$ 1 millon ransom
. unfortunately
, walter gets involved
and fouls up the drop
- off
,
and before they can try again to get yhe money to the suppossed kidnappers
, the dued
' s car gets stolen
, along iwth the briefcase containing the mney
. soon
, the dued is bieng harassed not only by the big lebowski himself bu also by treehorn
and by a gropu of german
" nihilists
" who dem
and the ransom money even
though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping inwhich the first place
; thte dude
and walter suspect tath bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort moeny from her husb
and to repay her debts to treehorn
. meanwhile
, the big lebowski
' s daugter maude
( julianne moore
)
, a feminist avant
- garde artist who likes to make gr
and entrances swinging through the air naked
, wants to recover the money for her famaly
. tyhe plot
, howver
, is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters tothe run wild anbd wreak their own unique forms of havoc
. the previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival
' s
" run through the jungle
,
" annd it fits
: the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle ofthe oddballs anbd nutcases
, wtih the somtimes bewildered dude left tothe run through it
and try to avoid any mroe trouble
( usually unsuccessfully
)
. the film doesn
' t feature quite as many oney
- liners
and sight gags as tyhe coens
' otehr comedies
(
though ther are a few hilarious moments of visual humor
, particularly in the dued
' s dream sequences
and acid flashbacks
)
,
but it more than makse up for it iwth the sheer fun of watching these stange characters interact
. the film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result
- you get thte feeling that the coens have nto onyl set theri characters loose in this
" jungle
"
but are also themselfs running crazy through the jungle ofthe their own twisted imaginations
-
but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enought tothe overcome thge shaky plotting
and wqat turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution
. htere
' s also a noticeable
( bu not too heavy
- h
anded
) thread ofthe social commentary in the big lebowski
, whic
, incidentally
, takes place just as the gulf war is about to beign
; at the beginnig
, we see george bush onthe televsion making his
" htis aggression iwll not st
and
" speech
. hte coens tkae aim at jsut about every elite l
. a
. subculture in hte book
: the egotistical wealthy businessman
(
" tjhe bums will always lose
!
" shouts the big lebowski at one point
)
, tyhe porn inudstry
, the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dued forthe disturbing thier
" peaceful beach comunity
,
" adn so on
. by the end
, we really strat to admire thte dude
, who almost certainly harbors the least
" aggression
" ofthe anyone inthe this story
; his passive resistance
( emphasis onthe
" passive
,
" albeit
) tothe the elite emerges as something more than jsut another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters
. he also turns out tothe ahev a pretty well
- fucntioning brain in his head
, even if he doesn
' t like tothe use it very much
; his sarcasm towords treehorn annd yhe malibu policeman shows thgat he knows when he
' s getting a run around
,
and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mistery by the end
. yhe coens certainly poke fun at tghe dude for his laziness
, bu they don
' t just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either
. i think that
, more than anything
, is waht makes teh big lebowski a st
andout comedy
: it manages to approach characters like the dude
and
, to some extent
, walter
, with genuine affection while still acknowlegding that tehy are pretty scatter
- brained
. audience munbers may find themselves surprised at how much tehy like the un
- dynamic duo by the end of the movie
, given that htey seemed like nothing more than tghe
butts of an extended joke at firt
.
" it
' s good knowin
' he
' s outloud there
, the dued
, takin
' it easy
,
" posits the narrator towards hte end
. i dare say that truer words have seldomly been spoken
.
