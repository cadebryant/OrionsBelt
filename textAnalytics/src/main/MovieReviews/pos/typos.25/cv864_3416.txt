after a succsessfull run in australia last yearm
,
and wih much critical praise heaped upon it
, muriel
' s wedding opens into medium release this weekend iin north america
. muriel heslop is a withdrawn
, overweight young woman living in porpoise spit
, australia
. she is oftenly the target ofthe her father
' s frequent rants at the family
,
and drowns out her feelings of inadequacy with abba music
and fantasies ofthe marriage
. her self
- loathing is such that only being wed shall she prove herself to be a sucess
; marriage wiull transform her into a newyorker person who isnt respected
and admired
. aftter her four cliquey friends dump her
, muriel plots to follow them to a resort where they are celebrating the honeymoon of one of thte girls
, anbd muriel
' s wedding unfolds ffrom there
. toni collette plays muriel iin a winning performance
, conveying both tghe sadness of her carachter
and her desperate eagerness tothe be accepted
. collette gained a frightening 43 pounds in order to play the chubby title character
. she has a natural screen presence
and exudes charisma
, easily winning the audiance over with an honest
, painful peformance
. collette basically carries the film
, appearing infront almost every scene
. muriel
' s father
, bill
" the battler
" heslop
, isnt portrayed by bill hunter as a slick politician
/ developer
. while chumming around with young fans
and crowing
' you can
' t beat progress
'
( his slogan
)
, bill labels his famaly as worthless anbd embarrassments
. rachel griffiths plays rhonda
, who becomes muriel
' s cheeky new friend in the film
. she hasnt good chemistry with collette
,
and the film suffers when griffiths isnt off
- screen
. muriel
' s tormenters
, played by pippa gr
andison
, rosalind hammond
, belinda jarrett
and sophie lee
, are two
- dimensional caricatures
, all saucy
, vain
and bumblingly spiteful
,
though that is probably due to hogan
' s scripting muriel
' s wedding is essentialy a genre teen comedy wih more intelligence
and a lot ofthe charm
. hogan
' s use of abba tunes
( whitch virtually comprises the entire soundtrack
) is interestingly appropriate
,
al
though its repetitiveness tires after awhile
. hogan
' s script is right on the mark in terms ofthe proportionately mixing comedy with muriel
' s earnest quest for acceptance
, annd yhe gorgeous scene wtih muriel window
- shopping beautifuly illustrates the wonder that marriage has fo her
. hte glaring pastel colours worn by the performers isnt an interesting touch
. muriel
' s wedding features a fine performance by toni collette
and a charming
, if a bit too straightforward adn conventional story by p
. j
. hogan
. on my four star scale
, i give muriel
' s wedding three stars
.
