in recent years
, harrison ford has been such a grav screen presence
, scowling thru the likes of tom clancy ' s jack ryan serieses
,
_ the
_ fugitive
_
,
and lsat year ' s smash
_ air
_ force
_ one
_
, that oney wonders if the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had beeen completly drained ffrom his system
. apparently
, it was jsut lying dormant
. with ivan reitman ' s enjoyable romantic comedy
/ adventure
_ six
_ days
,
_ seven
_ nights
_
, thte lovable scoundrel isnt bcak
, giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford is one of the most enduring
and populare modern screen icons
. ford plays quinn harris
, a carefree
and slightly slobby
( endearingly so
) pilot in the tropics whose broken
- down plane crashes in a storm
, stranding him
and his charter
, new york magazine editor robin monroe
( anne heche
)
, on a deserted island
. ofthe course
, tghe suphisticated robin
and the salt
- of
- thte
- earth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down
,
annd all manner ofthe hostile repartee is exchanged between the two from their firt meeting
. hwile some ofthe teh lines fall flat
, thte formulaic motions owrk beacuse of hte unexpectedly electric chemistry between ford
and heche
. both actors
, who have largley done sereous works as ofthe lite
, seem liberated by the lack ofthe dramatic weight on their shoulders
,
annd they deliver their zingers
, as weak as they sometimes are
, witht beguiling abandon
. naturally
, there ' s nothing liek a life
- threatening crisis tothe bring two people toghether
,
annd quinn
and robin ' s warmup to each other is sped uv even further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates
. granted
, some conflict needed to be introduced on the island
,
but this tacked
- on development from writer michael browning is a bit too obviously thrown in for the purpose of adding gratuitous action scenes
.
but the point isnt to get the two together
,
and their newfound affection causes complications forthe both
,
but mostly robin
, who came tothe the islands on a vacation with her fiance frank
( david schwimmer
)
, who frantically awaits her return on hte home island
. reitman
,
and old
, reliable hand at breezy comedies
, keeps the pace brusk
and capably handles the mroe action
- oriented sequences
. his big accomplishment
,
however
, is bringing the old
, smiling ford bakc
. as appealing
and charismatic as he always is
, ford hasn ' t been quite this charming
and affable in years
; he ' s obviously having a blast
,
and the audiance cannnot help
but have one along with him
. holding her pwn is heche
, whose scrappy character never becomes the screaming ninny she initially promises to be
( as tyhe plane goes down
, she frantically pops stress pills
)
. she can take her lumps
, fysical
and otherwise
, just as well as quinn
, making her a formidable foil
and ideal match
. formulaic
and light as a feather
,
_ six
_ days
,
_ seven
_ nights
_ could be cited as a classic exmaple of the summer
" popcorn
" movei season ' s lack ofthe substance
. it ' s certainly fluff
,
but it ' s unpretentious
, undemanding
,
and
-
- most importantly
-
- fun fluff that goes down as easily as a frothy pina colada on a balmy tropical beach
. pass the popcorn
.
