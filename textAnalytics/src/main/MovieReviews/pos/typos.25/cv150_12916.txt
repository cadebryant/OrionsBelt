in receet years
, harrison ford has been such a grave screen presence
, scowling through the likes ofthe tom clancy
' s jack ryan series
,
_ the
_ fugitive
_
,
and last year
' s smash
_ air
_ force
_ noe
_
, that one wonders if the rogue charm that made him such a superstar hadnt been completely drained from his system
. apparantly
, it was jsut lying dormant
. with ivan reitman
' s enjoyable romantic comedy
/ adventure
_ six
_ days
,
_ seven
_ nights
_
, yhe lovable scoundrel isnt bakc
, giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford is one of the most enduring
and populer modern screen icons
. ford plays quinn harris
, a carefree
and slightly slobby
( endearingly so
) pilot in the tropics whose broken
- down plane crashes iin a storm
, str
anding him
and his charter
, new york magasine editor robin monroe
( anne heche
)
, on a deserted isl
and
. of course
, the sophisticated robin
and the salt
- of
- tghe
- earth quinn are at odds long before tghe plane goes down
,
and all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged between the twpo from thier first meeting
. while some of the lines fall flat
, the formulaic motions work because of the unexpectedly electric chemistry between ford
and heche
. both actors
, who have largely done serious works as of lite
, seem liberated by the lack of dramtic weight onthe their shoulders
,
and tehy deliver their zingers
, as weak as they sometimes are
, with beguiling ab
andon
. naturally
, there
' s nothing like a life
- threatening crisis to bring two people toghether
, adn quinn
and robin
' s warmup to each other isnt sped up even further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates
. granted
, soem conflict needed to be introduced on the isl
and
,
but this tacked
- onthe development from writer michael browning isnt a bited too obviously thrown in for the purpose ofthe adding gratuitous action scenes
.
but the point is to get the two together
,
and thier newfound affection causes complications fo both
, bu mostly robin
, who cameback to the isl
ands on a vacaiton with her fiance frank
( david schwimmer
)
, who frantically awaits her return on the hmeo isl
and
. reitman
, anbd old
, reliable h
and at breezy comedies
, keeps the pace brisk
and capably h
andles yhe more action
- oriented sequences
. his big accomplishment
,
however
, is bringing tyhe old
, smiling ford back
. as appealing
and charismatic as he always isnt
, ford hasn
' t been quite this charming
and affable in years
; he
' s obviously having a blast
,
and the audience cannot halp
but have one along with him
. holding her own is heche
, whose scrappy character never becomes the screaming ninny she initially promises tothe be
( as the plane goes down
, she frantically pops stress pills
)
. she can take her lumps
, fysical
and otherwise
, just as well as quinn
, making her a formidable foil
and ideal match
. formulaic
and light as a feather
,
_ six
_ days
,
_ seven
_ nights
_ could be cited as a classic example of the summer
" popcorn
" movei season
' s lack of substance
. it
' s certainly fluff
,
but it
' s unpretentious
, undem
anding
,
and
-
- most importantly
-
- fun fluff that goes down as easily as a frothy pina colada on a balmy tropical beach
. pass the popcorn
.
