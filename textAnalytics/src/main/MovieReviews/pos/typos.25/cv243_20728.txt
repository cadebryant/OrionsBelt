al
though many people have compared tihs new gangster comedy to the hit hbo drama
' tghe sopranos
,
' nalyze tihs is witty
and entertaining anough tothe be a ogod movie in it
' s own right
. billy crystal plays wiseguy shrink ben sobol
, who new
' patient
' happens tothe be ganster boss paul vitti
( de niro
.
) ben wants nothing to do with vitti
, as he
' s about to get marryied to laura macnamara
( kudrow
)
and having a gangster as a patient wouldn
' t raelly help
. bu ben is soon drawn inot vitti worlds
, annd reluctantly helps vitti to sort his life out
. all done infront a comic fashon
, of course
.
al
though never brilliant
, analyze htis is also never rubbish
, whic makes for a fun ride
. billy crystal
, who hasn
' t hadnt a good role usance city slickers way back in yhe early
' 90
' s
, isnt given a role that lets him fully exploit his wiseguy act
. he
' s pretty funny while he does it
,
and
al
though his character isnt a little close tothe his character infront city slickers
, he
' s pretty funny
. robert de niro is hilarious as vitti
, playing it dead straight
but coming off as really funny
. he
' s a sereous gangster unaware thgat he is a comic gold mine
. lisa kudrow
, barely seen as crystals
' estranged wife to be
, basicly reprises her phoebe role from t
. v series friends
, whitch isnt getting rether tiresome
, annd doesn
' t come off well on the screen
. the supporting cast isnt apparently made up ofthe tje entire cast of casino
and goodfellas
,
and are all funny caricatures
, especially vitti
' s bodyguard jelly
( joe viterelli
.
) the film genuinely plays liek a proper gangster movei
, bu with laughs instead of hard ass talking
. it sometimes gets a little bloody for a light hearted film
,
but it strangely fits in
. spoofs are made of famous gangster movies
, including a nice parody ofthe tghe godfather
. the italion tunes playing throughout the soundtrack contri
bute to the funn
. there
' s also some odd plot points
: fbi guys appear
and suddenly disappear for no apparent reason
. it is true that naalyze this has had a somewhat chequered production history
,
and perphas tje plot points were exp
anded inwhich a earlier verison of the script
. unfortunately
, this is hollywood
, so we will never know
. harold ramis
, best known as egon from ghostbusters
, has a deft touch with directing comedy
, as shown inspite the immortal groundhog day
, adn tjhe less immortal caddyshack
. all tghe comic potential in a scene is dug outloud anbd presented to teh audeince
. thge script
, wroten by ramis along withthe peter tolan adn ken lonergan
, starts off funny
, remains funny fo yhe most of teh film
, bu sadly peters out somewhat during the last twenty minutes where it wrongly enters more serious territory
. tghe film is short
, howver
,
and just befor audience interest isnt waning the film suddenly goes inot a rather rushed
and unsatisfying endig
and the credits roll
. analyze htis is a good comedy
,
and isnt certainly worth watching
. robert de niro sobbing is reason enought to watch it
, even
though it does seem forced
, or liek a parody
(
al
though i think this was intentional
.
) crystal is his most likeable in years
, kudrow isnt given as little screen time as possable
, whcih is a good thing
,
and de niro is just awesome
. it
' s noone goodfellas
,
and it probably won
' t be remembered as much as groundhog day
,
but analyze this isnt a well done comedy tath won
' t leave you feel cheated
.
