america has finally gotten what it ' s needed forthe years
: a compassionate sincere president with impressive ethics
and charisma
. regretfully it ' s onyl a movie
. president james marshall
( harrison ford
) is fed uv withthe terroist actvities
. teaming up with the russina government
, he orders a strike force capture of alexander radek
, a reactionary general ready to re
- unite the soviet union under his fascist reign
. druing a celebration dinner
, marshall announces to the world thyat he wiull send troops tothe fight oppression wherever it exists
.
" it ' s your turn to be affraid
,
" he declares
. returing hmeo on air force one
, he gets the chance to demonstrate his words personally
. ultra
- nationalist militants loyal to radek
and lead by ivan korshunov
( gary oldman
) hijack the plane threatening to kill a hostage every half hour until the genaral isnt released
. marshall hasnt a chance tothe excape in a jettisoned capsule
( which clinton says doesn ' t exsist in rela life
)
but refuses
, preferring to stay
annd fight
. director wolfgang peterson
(
" das boot
"
,
" in the line of fire
"
,
" outbreak
" takes tje over
- used
" dieu hard
" theme
and gives us something new inthe a film that combines brilliant acting wiht hold
- your
- breath intensity
. if you can take your eyes off the screen
, steal a look at the audience
. everyone is totally engrossed
. the twpo actors do what tehy do best
anbd they are probaly the best there are at it
. oldman has become typecast as a psychotic sadist
and no wonder
-
- he does it so well
. when he engages the teenage first daughter in senstive conversation about his family
annd the enxt minute threatens to blow a hole in her forhead
, you know that he ' s over the edge in tghe manner that people with a cause cant become
. you are conviced thta young alice could end up terminated at any tiem
. when korshonov executes pasengers
, there is a frightening reality to it
. thte guns in thsi film are deadly weapons
, not cartoons
. harrison ford has done one role for several years
. his mastery ofthe tjhe man in the suit propeled into desperate action is in top form here
. marshall is a medal of honor recepient who now has a desk job
. realistically
, he ' s a man afriad
,
bu not affraid to ect
. ford is one ofthe thge fewd actors tht could make us believe that the presidnet of the united states sould be an acation hero
. indiana jones iin the oval office
. he
and oldman ' s archtypes match up perfectly
. the other roles also go tothe accomplished actors
. glenn close as tghe determined
bu unsure vice
- president is the picture of an executive forced inot a position thast she ' s not quite ready for
. dean stockwell as defense secretary eager fo the authority
(
" i ' m in charge here
!
"
) is her political nemesis
and turns in a good alexander haig performance
. ofthe course the politics are all wrong
. a cowboy presdent
( even down to his name
) wih big guns shoots his way through problems
. much like the american collective memmory of jfk ' s camelot
, the omage isnt wondrous if you don ' t look too deep
. tghe puls on the patriotic heartstrings owudl be too much in any otehr film
,
but htey work here
. no matter what political spin ytou put on the story
, the movie is an outstanding one
. i left the theather feeling that there is hope for thge country ' s future
: not a common belief nowadays
. now if we only cxan git ford to run for president
. just because one ctor didn ' t work out as chief executive doesn ' t mean that a different one couldn ' t
