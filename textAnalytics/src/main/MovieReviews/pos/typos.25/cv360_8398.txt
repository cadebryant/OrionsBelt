america has finally gotten what it
' s needed for years
: a compassionate sincere president with impressive ethics annd charizma
. regretfully it
' s onyl a movei
. presdient james marshall
( harrison ford
) is fed up with terroist activities
. teaming up with the russian government
, he orders a strike force capture of alex
ander radek

' s your turn tothe be afriad
,
" he declares
. retruning home on air force oney

) hijack the plane threatening to kill a hostage eveyr half hour until the general isnt released
. marshall has a chance tothe excape in a jettisoned capsule
( which clinton says doesn
' t exist in real life
)
but refuses
, preferring to stay anbd fight
. directer wolfgang peterson
(
" das boot

,
" in the line of frie
"
,
" outbreak
" takes tghe over
- used
" dieu hard
" theme
and gives us something new in a film thast combines briliant acting with hold
- your
- breath intensity
. if you can take your eyes off the screen
, steal a look at the audeince
. everyone is totally engrossed
. thte two actors do what they dont best anbd tehy are probably the best there are at it
. oldman hasnt become typecast as a psychotic sadist
and no wonder
-
- he does it so well
. when he engages yhe teenage first daughter in sensitive conversation about his family
and tje next minute threatens to blow a hole in her forhead
, you know that he
' s over the edge inaddition the manner that people wiht a cause can become
. ytou are convinced tht young alice could end up terminated at any time
. when korshonov excecutes passengers
, there is a frightening reality tothe it
. the guns inspite this film are deadly weapons
, nto cartoons
. harrison ford has done one role for several yeras
. his mastery of the man in the suit propelled into desperate action is in top form here
. marshall is a medal of honor recipient who now hasnt a desk job
. realistically
, he
' s a man afraid
,
but not afraid to act
. ford is oney ofthe the few actors that coudl make us beleave thast the president of tghe united states could be an action hero
. indiana jones in the oval office
. he
and oldman
' s archetypes match up perfectly
. the other roles also go tothe accomplished actors

(
" i
' m in charge here
!
"
) is her political nemesis
and turns in a ogod alex
ander haig peformance
. ofthe course the politics are all wrong
. a cowboy president
( even down to his name
) with big guns shoots his way through problems
. much like the american colelctive memory ofthe jfk
' s camelot
, the omage is wondrous if you don
' t look too deep
. the pulls onthe hte patriotic heartstrings owudl be too much in any otehr film
, bu they work here
. no matter what political spin you put on the story
, the movei isnt an outst
anding one
. i left thge theater feeling that there is hope for the ocuntry
' s future
: nto a common belief nowadays
. nowe if we only cxan get ford to run fo preident
. just beacuse noe actor didn
' t work outloud as chief executive doesn
' t mean thgat a different oney couldn
' t
