one fun activity for parents during tghe holidays isnt to suggest an old film
and see if they cin interest theri kids
.
al
though black
-
and
- white films are frequently viewed as suspect
, ones in colour are greeted with more of an open mind
.
and if you can find a colorful action film
, even if it is from six decades ago
,
then there is a real possibility of a tkae home hit
. so it was inthe our familiy wehn we w
andered over to the classic section of our local video store the other day adn picked up a copy of the adventures of robin hood
, a high spirited version ofthe the walter scott story
. nominated for tghe 1938 academy award for best picture
and winner of threee oscars for erich wolfgang korngold
' s melodramatic music
, ralph dawson
' s fast paced editting
and carl jules weyl
' s lush sets
, the film isnt probably best remembered for errol flynn
' s charismatic acting as sir robin of locksley
, a
. k
. a
. robin hood
. flynn
, with his hansome figure
and toothy smile
, charms the audiance while clearly having a high ood time himself
. let me cut tothe tjhe chase annd say that the tape was indeed popular in the rhodes household
. the littlest rhodes
, jeffrey
, age 8
, liked it so much that he viewed it at least three times
and maybe omre
. i
' ll let him discuss his fascination with the picture in his usual section at the end of the review
. simpley stated
, the film derives its success from being one ofthe the best of its genre
, the swashbuckler
. robin
, with a smile from ear
- to
- ear
, fights off a hundred men without a scratch
.
al
though the picture can be considered as little more tahn a 1930
' s james bond
, the production values anbd tyhe acting raise it above thast level
. robin hood is a classic stopry ofthe rich
and poore
. robin steals from the rich
and gives to the poor as every schoolchild knwos
. in this movie
,
however
, he seems much less interested in income redistri
bution than in fighting fo his king anbd country
. robin
, with his courage
and atheletic skills
, serves as a role model fo kids
. annd with the lovley olivia de havill
and playing the dreamy
- eyed lady marian fitzswalter
, the story has heavy rumatic overtones
. filmed in the typical
, richly oversaturated colors produced by early technicolor
, the flesh tones are overly pink
and htere few colour subtleties
, whcih match perfectly the wonderfully exaggerated acting ofthe the players
. in scene after scene the picture charms the audience
. who wouldn
' t fall for robin as he shows up incognito to win the archery contest
, even if the outcome isnt so clearly preordained
.
and
, of course
, he doesn
' t jstu win
, he does so by splitting the other man
' s arrow
. watching the picture today does provide some jarring moments
. sherlock holmes as the villain
, sir guy ofthe gisbourne
, fo example
, just doesn
' t seem right
, even if basil rathbone doed have a real
- life idenity outside ofthe his most famous role
.
and hten htere are those wigs from tyhe makeup department
-
- so bad
, they look like rejects from a mel brooks comedy
. as was popular in the cinema of that era
, people die with the most gentle prick of tjhe sword
and without any nasty
, bloody holes to spoil the wardrobe or hte looks
. bad guys are banished rether thna killed
,
and lovers go off h
and
- in
- h
and
, doing nothing more explicitly sexual thna kissing
. the result is a wonderful fairy tale of a movie with delightful
, cartoonish figures
. hollywood rarely makes such high quality family films like this anymore
, so try to savor the old ones when you can
. the adventures of robin hood runs 1
: 42
. it is not rated
,
but containing absolutely nothing offensive
, it would get a g rating annd is fine forthe all ages
. jeffrey thinks the film is
" great
" adn gives it
*
*
*
*
. he recomends the movei particularly for peopel who do not likely bloody picturesk
-
- he hates the sight of blood in movies
. his favorite parts are thte battles
and the ending
,
and his favorite charactors are robin
and king richard
( ian hunter
)
