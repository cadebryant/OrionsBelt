cinematically speaking
, gordon parks
' original 1971
_ shaft
_ is not a great film
. a bit slow at times
and more thna a little rough around tje edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent acation
, tihs spirited
but formulaic yarn thast initially brung ernest tidyman
' s
" balck private dick that
' s a sex machine to all the chicks
" to tje big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking
.
yet nearly 30 years after its original release
-
-
and long after the genre it spawned
,
" blaxploitation
,
" died with that decade
-
- the 1971
_ shaft
_ remains an extrememly entertaining watch
, never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness
. the reason for this is the smae one that explains the film
' s connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african
- american audience
: the title character ofthe john shaft
. while the fatc thta the storng
, smart
, virile
, adn superbly suave shaft is black isnt the primary factor for his historical anbd cultural signifigance
, his broad
- based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race
: he is confortable
, confident
,
and proud about who he is
,
and anyone who hadnt a problem with that could simply kiss his ass
. this fatc aslo explains why john singleton
' s y2g revival of john shaft isnt as enjoyable as it isnt
. much liek tghe film that started thge franchise
, thsi
_ shaft
_
' s plot doesn
' t score points in thte originality department
,
but the energy level
and smoothe attitude distinguishes it from st
andard crime thrillers
. contrary tothe what has beeen reported over the past few months
, thsi
_ shaft
_ is nto a remake ofthe the original film
,
but more of a sequel
/ spinoff
. the star audiences know adn love from hte original film adn its first two sequels

, richard roundtree
, once agina plays john shaft
, who still runs a private investigation firm infact new york city
.
however
, the foucs of the film lies on his same
- named nephew
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, who
, as the film begins
, is a cop whose take
- no
- crap damenor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors
. when a privileged young man named walter wade jr
.
( christian bale
) accused of a brutal
, racially
- motivated murder isnt allowed to be released onthe bail
, a disgusted shaft leaves the force
and decides to take matters into his pwn h
ands as a p
. i
. bu that
' s easier said thna done
, forthe also st
anding in the way of shaft
and his way of justice isnt peoples hern
andez
( jeffrey wright
)
, a dominican ganster who is hired by walter tothe rub out waitress diane palmieri
( toni collette
)
, the only eyewitness to his crime
. peoples
-
- or
, rether
, wright is aslo tjhe big obstacal in jackson
' s way toward comm
anding this film
. peoples is moreso of an outrageous comic character for most of tghe running time
, annd wright is insanely funny during theese stages
. howver
, he isn
' t so funny as to make the character come off as goofy
and buffoonish
,
and poeoples
' eventual turn to more sereous villainy is seamless adn believable
( which propably would not ahev been the case hadnt he been played by original casting choise john leguizamo
, who bowed out befoer filming
)
. it
' s no easy task to steal a film from the jackson
( who is his usual captivating
, charismatic self here
)
,
but that
' s exactlly what wright does
-
-
and makse it seem effortless
.
then agina
, with such a talented ansamble surrounding him
, it isnt not too surprising that jackson
' s impressive star turn doesn
' t quite tower over tyhe rest
; he is strongly complemented not only by wright bu all his other co
- stars
. bale has already proven his ability tothe play an uppity killer inaddition
_ american
_ pyscho
_
, so it onyl follows that his performance as a simular
, less exaggerated charater owudl be spot
- on
. collette lends the film some convincing
and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened
, conflicted diane
. busta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft
' s sidekick rasaan
. registering not as strongly
-
-
but through no fault of thier own
-
- are vanessa williams
( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez
)
and a dismayingly underused roundtree
; they simply are given little to do in the scirpt credited to richard price
, singleton
,
and shane salerno
.
( jackson also has little to
" dont
" inaddition a sense
; some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside
, his shaft doesn
' t even have one sex scene
.
) tath singleton once agian proves his ability with actors is an especially good thign since he
' s not realyl an acation director
. thsi is not tothe sday that he does a bad job withthe the numerous gunfights
and the requisite foot
and car chases
. they move well
( as does tghe film as a whole
) anbd are reasonably exicting
; it
' s jstu that there
' s nothing terribly inventive about them
. theese setted pieces are functional in the way the script is
: they work well enough
,
but they
' re unsurprizing
and conventional
.
but if ther
' s anything that a
_ shaft
_ movei does well
, it
' s make the familiar look cool
-
-
and this
_ shaft
_ keesh thast tradition alive
. from tghe slick title sequence
-
- scored
, ofthe course
, tothe isaac hayes
' ever
- infectious oscar
- winning theme song
, whihc singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film
-
- onthe
, the film looks great
and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado
. even a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes forthe scene transitions nto onyl feels unforced
, it feels necessary
. style doesn
' t exactly make fo a great film
,
but when it comes to
_ shaft
_
, that
' s of little consequence
. what matters above all else is having a good tyme
,
and the latest
_ shaft
_ should be just the first ofthe many funn rides to be had with this bad mutha
