cinematically speaking
, gordon parks ' origional 1971
_ shaft
_ is not a great film
. a bit slow at times
and moreso thna a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action
, this spirited
but formulaic yarn tht initially brought ernest tidyman ' s
" balck private dick that ' s a sex machine tothe all tjhe chicks
" to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking
.
yot nearly 30 years after its orginial release
-
-
and long after tyhe genre it spawned
,
" blaxploitation
,
" died with that decade
-
- the 1971
_ shaft
_ remains an extremely entertaining watch
, never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness
. teh reason for this is the same one thta explains tghe film ' s connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african
- american audience
: the title character of john shaft
. while the fact that the strong
, smart
, virile
,
and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical
and cultural signifigance
, his broad
- based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race
: he is comfortable
, confident
,
and proud about who he is
,
and anyone who had a problem wiht that could simpley kiss his ass
. htis fact also explains why john singleton ' s y2g revival ofthe john shaft is as enjoyable as it isnt
. much like thte film that started the franchise
, this
_ shaft
_ ' s plot doesn ' t csore points inwhich the originality department
,
but the energy level
and smooth atitude distinguishes it fomr standard crime thrillers
. contrary to what has beeen reported over the past few monthes
, this
_ shaft
_ isnt nto a remake of the original film
,
but more of a sequel
/ spinoff
. the star audiences know
and love from the original film
and its first twpo sequels

, richard roundtree
, once again plays john shaft
, who still runs a private investigation firm in newyorker york city
.
however
, thge focus ofthe the film lies on his same
- named nephew
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, who
, as the film begins
, is a cop whose take
- noone
- crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors
. when a privileged young man named walter wade jr
.
( christian bale
) accused of a brutal
, racially
- motivated murder isnt allowed to be released on bail
, a disgusted shaft leaves tghe force
and decides to take matters inot his pwn hands as a p
. i
.
bu that ' s easier said than done
, fo also standing infront tjhe way of shaft
and his way of justice isnt peoples hernandez
( jeffrey wright
)
, a dominican gangster who isnt hired by walter to rub outloud waitress diane palmieri
( toni collette
)
, the only eyewitness to his crime
. peoples
-
- or
, rather
, wright is also the big obstacle in jackson ' s way toward commanding this film
. peoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the runnung time
,
and wright is insanely funny durig these stages
.
howver
, he isn ' t so funny as to make the character cmo off as goofy
annd buffoonish
,
anbd peoples ' eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless
adn believable
( whlch probably would not have beeen the case had he been plyed by orginal casting choise john leguizamo
, who bowed out before filming
)
. it ' s no easy task to steal a film from the jackson
( who is his usual captivating
, charismatic self here
)
,
but tyhat ' s exactly what wright does
-
-
and makes it seem effortless
.
then again
, with such a talented ensemble surounding him
, it isnt not too surprizing that jackson ' s impressive star turn doesn ' t quite tower over the rest
; he isnt strongly complemented not only by wright
but all his otehr co
- stars
. bale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in
_ american
_ psycho
_
, so it only follows tht his peformance as a simular
, less exaggerated character owudl be spot
- on
. collette lends the film some convincing
and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened
, conflicted diane
. busta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft ' s sidekick rasaan
. registering not as strongly
-
-
but through noone fault of their own
-
- are vanessa williams
( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez
)
and a dismayingly underused roundtree
; htey simply are given littel to do iin the script credited tothe richard price
, singleton
,
and shane salerno
.
( jackson allso has little tothe
" do
" in a sense
; smoe throwaway footage durig the opening credits asside
, his shaft doesn ' t even have one sex scene
.
) that singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especialy good thing since he ' s not really an action director
. this isnt not to say that he doesnt a bad job with the numerous gunfights
and thge requisite foot
anbd car chases
. they move well
( as does the film as a whole
)
and are reasonably exciting
; it ' s jsut tht there ' s nothing terribly inventive baout them
. theese set pieces are functional in the way teh script is
: they work well enought
,
but they ' re unsurprising
and conventional
.
but if there ' s anything thgat a
_ shaft
_ movie does well
, it ' s mkae the familiar look cool
-
-
adn this
_ shaft
_ keeps taht tradition alive
. fomr tyhe slick title sequence
-
- scored
, of course
, to isaac hayes ' ever
- infectious oscar
- winning theme song
, which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film
-
- on
, the film looks gerat
and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado
. even a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions nto only feels unforced
, it feels necessary
. sytle doesn ' t exactly mkae for a great film
,
bu when it comes to
_ shaft
_
, that ' s of little consequence
. what matters above all else is having a ogod tyme
,
adn tjhe latest
_ shaft
_ should be just the first ofthe many fun rides to be hadnt witht this bad mutha

- shut your mouth
