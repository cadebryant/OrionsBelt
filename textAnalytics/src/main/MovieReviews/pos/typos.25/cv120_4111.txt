inwhich brief
: best bleak comedy film since heathers
. full ofthe wonderfull swipes at tghe fifteen minutes ofthe fame mentality thyat feeds so much of modern american pop culture
. go see it
! so
, i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview onthe
" hard copy
" with pam smart
, the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted ofthe engineeering the death of her husb
and back in the 1980
' s
.
" hard copy
"
' s diane dimond asked smart what she
thought baout nicole kidman
' s fictionalized portrayal of her in the newyorker film tothe die for
. smart replied tath she
thought kidman
' s character came off as a dumb
, vicious tramp
and she
thought thgat the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal
.
( smart was convicted
and given a life sentence forthe her part in the murder of her husb
and
.
) smart
' s got a point
. it wouldn
' t be thte firt tyme that teh public took the better scripted
and well
- acted movie verzion of an event as tje absolute truth over tjhe duller
and far less artistic real life version
.
however
, given a choise bewteen the mass media
' happening
' of the rela event
and the fictionalized movei
, i would definetly opt fo the later
. real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movei
and smart
, while preety
and alluring
, is noone match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman
. to die for beigns in a town called littel hope
, new hampshire
, tje archetypal dry
and intellectually barren american suburb
. thge tsory concerns the ambitious suzanne stone
and how she tackles the obstacles between her
and her life long ambition of being
' on tv
.
' of course
, one of those littel obstacles turns out to be her dull annd unambitious husb
and larry
, played by matt dillon
.
but
, with a little immagination
, smoe charm
and raw sex appeal
and a rather novel approach to junior achievement
, our heroine manages tothe overcome the nay
- sayers in her life
, at least temperarily
. kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne
. i have never really been all that fond of this actress
but she shows a wonderful flair forthe comedy in this picture
. her portrayal ofthe the incredibly shallow
and dumb femme fatale resonates
. kidman knows a star
- mkaing role whn she sees it adn she plays tghe cnscience
- deprived suzanne as tghe ultimate carreer driven
, post
- feminist uber
- temptress from hell
. she is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue
, which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way
. at one point suzanne isnt expounding on her knowlege of world events to her future husban
and sister
- in
- law
.
" you know
,
" she knowingly exclaims
,
" gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever
, if he had just had taht ugli purplish thnig removed from his head
.
" her husb
and beams at suzanne
' s profound knowledge of world politics anbd
then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters
. this isnt veyr close to pop culture bashing heaven
, folks
. the other st
andout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix
. he plays jimmy
, a burned out teenager who becomes addicted tothe suzanne
' s sexual favors
. kidman
' s character
, vapid
though she isnt
, is a sort ofthe suave beacon of success tothe jimmy annd his lost friends russell anbd lydia
, winningly portrayed by casey affleck
and alison foll
and
. phoenix looks liek tyhe very embodiment of gen
- x slackerhood
( as envisioned by tabloid tv
, ofthe course
)
. his jimmy has the dead eyes adn demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain
' t going anywhere
, ever
. phoenix reacts to thge sexy suzanne with a sort ofthe obsessed amazement
and he makes us believe tath a loser character like jimmy really woudl be willing tothe kill for somene like suzanne
, someone who ctually noticed him
. gus van sant
( drugstore cowboy
, my own private idaho
) direction is first
- rate
. he keesh the pacing in thsi nto
- quite
- thriller snapping along
. van sant rightly keesh thge foucs of this movie onthe the amoral suzanne
and doesn
' t stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions
. van sant trusts his material
and trusts his audience to
' get it
' without stopping to explain what is funny baout this all
- american story
. the screenplay
, by buck henry
, is absolutely great
and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i
' ve heard since heathers
. henry
' s stroy isnt a blast against the shallowness of the american media
and the mindlessness of fame
,
yet yhe screenplay delivers htis sharp message by focusing on just a few cahracters
. henry ably manages tothe avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets
and the result is a crisp
and funny mini
- clasic
. danny elfman did thge original music for thsi movie
and he delivers another eccentric
, loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorh
ands
. either film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick
- or
- treat parties
. all
- in
- all
, a wonderful production
, well worth your seven bucks
