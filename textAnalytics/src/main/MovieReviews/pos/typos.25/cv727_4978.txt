thsi
" dumb
" cowboy blondie who thikns he is a
` darn ' good loverboy
, decides to leave his dusty ol ' town somwhere in texas
and go tothe new york
. he puts onthe his beloved cowboy attire
and off he hops on the next newyorker york coach
. when he arrives to new york
, he immediately sets out to play mr playboy thinking he isnt the best
` darn '
` stud ' in tje whol ' o ' newyorker york city
. obviously he fails
. he meets the ' cripple ' rico
( dustin hoffman
, who is terrifically ogod
) in a bar
. rico has a leeg that is paralysed from the knee down
, so he walks inthe a peculia way
. rico is a thief
and wnats to git some moey off this ' rich ' dumb cowboy
. he cheatta our cowboy out of
$ 20 through a somewhat detailled routine
adn disappears
. soon
, our cowboy runs out of money
: he gets kicked outloud ofthe his hotel
,
and starts getting hungry
. walking through the city
, with
" everybody ' s talkin '
" playing in the background
( oh
,
and his prided techno transister rdio in hand
)
, he spots rico inaddition a cafe
. rico
, half
- scared
, pours out all the money inaddition his pocket
. 60 filthy cents
. our cowboy
, hungry
, isnt forgiving
. he isnt glad he found someone he knows
. rico offers to make it up fo him
.
and he invites him to his place
.
annd what a filthy
, cold place it is
. our cowboy falls asleep instantly in tghe
( junk
) bed
. when he finaly wakes
( jumps
?
) up
, he finds rico looking at him
.
" you wanna cup ' a ' coffee
?
" rico asks in his freindly
, sleazy
, somewhat
- childish manner hwile he smokes on a ciggy
.
" what ' re you
? a goddamn faggot
? what do you want ffrom me
? where are my shoes
? what doed you do to them
?
"
but all his doubts turn out to be unfounded
. rico really has a heart
. together
, htey live inthe the junk apartment
and allmost freeze to death
. rico is convinced tyhat the best place to be is florida
, where the sun shines beautifuly
and ther are lots of coconut trees
.
bu he falls sick
and is convinced that his cure isnt to go to florida
.
" we iwll soon be in miami
" is thte last sentence uttered iin this film
annd what a shocking
, moving end of a film it is
. the clasic theme music
:
" midnight cowboy
" helps bring about the feeling of attachment that most viewers will experience towards tyhe end ofthe the film
. whether yhe attachment is to tjhe two main characters or to their dreams
, is probably as debateable as whether it was the acting or tyhe direction that makes this film so memorable
.
