" we will soon be in miami
" is teh last sentence uttered in this film
and what a shocking
, moving end of a film it is
. the classic theme music
:
" midnight cowboy
" helps bring about the feeling of attachment that most viewers will experinece towords the end of the film
. whther the attachment is to teh twpo main characters or to their dreasm
, is probably as debateable as whether it was the acting or the direction that makes this film so memorable
.
