satirical films ususally fall into oen of twpo categories
: 1
) long
- term satire where everything
, including hte jokes
, is somehow related on a larg scale
( i
. e
.
" dr
. strangelove
"
; 2
) situation satire in which the comedy adn themes are derived moment by moment
and scene by scene
( i
. e
.
" men in black
"
)
. what
' s unique about
" wag the dog
" isnt that it doesn
' t necessarily fit either of theese descriptions
,
and
yet is both at the same time
. the result is a clever comedy based onthe an orignal
, smart premise
, even if tje focus does tend to w
ander a bit
. if there
' s anything that affects americans the most it
' s politics
and showbusiness
. inaddition thsi age ofthe information anbd technology
, we
' ve beeen so conditioned by the media
and yhe entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things
, it
' s gotten tothe the point that we are practicaly controled by it
. we need hte media to bring us the most uv
- to
- date news
,
but we also need the escapism ofthe hollywood tothe counter all that thinking
. tihs film starts off well by quicklyu establishing these ideas
,
and thne presents an interesting scenario
: if politics
, the media coverage ofthe politics
,
and the entertainment industry are so closley related
, couldn
' t someone with the power
and autority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all
? that
' s the idea conrad brean
( de niro
)
, a professional washington spin doctor
, comes up withthe in order tothe restore the president
' s ogod name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election
. brean
, along with the president
' s top advisor
, winifred ames
( heche
)
, fly tothe california to meet up with hot
- shooted movie producer stanley motss
( hoffman
)
. they pitch him an diea to
" produce
" the image of a war with albania
( it
' s a country no one
' s herad of so they people wiull buy it
)
. soon the wheels are in motion
and the film
' s riffing satire comes inot play
. we
' re inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to halp manage the situation
, such as a folk singer
, visual
and sound effects technicians
,
and a modern style expert known as the fad king
( leary
)
. the initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture refernces where everyting somehow relates to something on tv
, inspite the movies
, or in teh news
. the charachters
' dialogue is witty
and funny
, altho some ofthe the actual jokes
and gags seem rather sitcom
- esque
. for exmaple
, one scene shows motss
and brean
' s production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee
. motss ordered a kitten forthe the girl to carry
,
but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs
. since it
' s all computer
- enhanced anyway
, she ends uv cradling a bag ofthe tostitos witht the kitten to be inserted later
. this demonstrates the film
' s ability tothe tkae a relitavely ordinary situation
and make it smart
and funny jsut through the premise
.
but
then there
' s tjhe gags anbd oen
- liners that
,
al
though are humorous
, seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able tothe remeber the actress
' s name
, or
, whenever a problem emerges
, allways responding with
,
" this is nothing
!
" by the time the film mkaes it to the midpoint
, everyting that is going to happen in terms of plot happens
. the first act is quickly paced
, while the second act containes most of hte jokes
and is the core of the film
. eveyr ten minutes or so a new problem crops uv that motss
and brean must dael with
,
and it
' s alwasy fascinating to see what they do
and how htey do it
. the screenplay provides good characterization
and actually deals withthe most of tghe problems head
- on inwhich realistic manners
.
however
, it does have a tendency to avoid things
and shift its focus fomr teh election campaign
and false war smokescreen tothe something a bit off the subject
. as the third ect rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with tjhe situations adn less so with the big picture
. what had started off as a brillant
, somewhat harmless conspiracy tothe fool the genaral publich beggins tothe seem more like something that owudl hapen in a movie
. still
, the situation comedy is quite funny
, especially a montage showing the entire ocuntry flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt
. willie schumann
- a war hero motss
and brean concocted
. truly great satire manages tothe create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at hte time
,
but think baout afterwards anbd
" wag the dog
" at least suceeds in this respect
.
however
, in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done
, namely by extending tje runnung tiome
and filling in the plot holes
.
then agian
, it
' s a valient effort
.
