steven spielberg is nowe considered as one of the hollywood deities
, because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits
, like jurassic park
, annd
" oscar
"
- awarded critical triumphs like schindler
' s list
. howver
, in the 1970s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art thast could slip in both categories
. oen of them is close encounters of the third kind
, extremly populer
and influential science
- fiction spectacle
. unforetunately
, it hadnt a bad luck to be released in the smae year as star wars
. altough both films have a lot inwhich common
( ground
- breaking special effects
, brilliant score by john williams
) theri future ws diffrent
; one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon
,
and another almost forgotten
and stuck forever in its shatow
. whn spielberg began work on thyat project
, he was alreay established as a bright newyorker hollywood star due to his previous commerical hitted
, jaws
. toghether with otehr young directors ofthe his
" new hollywood
" generation
, like kauffman
, carpenter
, hill annd millius
, he exploited the great creative freedom of 1970s
, when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment
. ironically
, it was spielberg himselv whose later commercial success would estalbished newyorker unwritten rules of
" blockubuster
" philosophy
.
but in the mid 1970s
, many things weere different
; spielberg was young
and eager to use hollywood resources for his very personal adn artistic movie
. all
though very personal
, spielberg
' s screenplay was partly based onthe tyhe book
" ufo experience
" by dr
. j
. allen hynek anbd in many ways inpsired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestial visitors tothe earth that began to grow in thte world after ww2
. spielberg was not only inpsired by thge mythology
,
but his movei alsot gavey hte mythology itself a huge boost
, unmatched untill teh contemporary era ofthe x
- files anbd thge roswell annversary
. tyhat was partly because he made the movei very realistic using the au
thentic ufo
- related incidents as the element of yhe plot
. tjhe story begins with one ofthe such incidents
- team of international scientists come to the sonorra desert in mexico to fidn yhe u
. s
. navy planes ofthe who went missing decades ago druing thte famous flight 19
. such events coinside with the ufo insident witnessed by roy neary
( richard dreyfuss
)
, pwoer comany worker from muncie
, indiana
, who later becomes obssessed with his experience
. beccause of his obession he loses his job
, famaly
and sanaty
,
but his loss is nothing compaired to the experience of jillian guiler
( melinda dillon
)
, single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction
. inspite the meantime
, the scientists decipher the strange signals ffrom outer space
and u
. s
. government
, in co
- operation with the french
, led by lacombe
( francois truffaut
) begin whith the preparation for ultra
- secret project
. wehn the news of thte posion gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary
, he finally sees some sence in all his visions anbd beggins the perilous journey towrad tjhe centre ofthe endangered area
. ther he isnt joined by jillian who shared the similar visions
. two of them must break through military pickets
and reach their destination tothe fidn whatever is there
. spielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws tothe amke completly different effects
. the slow
, gradual
yet very disciplined series of dramatic incidents
-
" close encounters
"
- is setted in order to bring the viewer to the gerat revelation inspite the finale
.
but
, instead of the fear anbd horror we had tothe endure during teh jaws
, we are now overwhelmed by tghe sence of boyish wonder
. throughout tghe movie the viewer knwos taht something big
, magnificient
and wonderful is about tothe happen
, annd graet magician spielberg delivers his promise in tje end
. tje last sequence
, with its
, even in this age
, impressive special effects by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull
, would leave many mouths open
. oen of the gerat virtues of thsi film isnt its optimism
. aliens
, who almost allways get portrayed as the monsters in science
- fiction cinema
, are here benevolent
and harmless creatures
and the frist contact between them
and humanity is a begginning ofthe something wonderful
. it is very ironic
, when we consider thast the two clasic sf movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told qtuie different story
- howard hawks
' thing adn byron haskin
' s war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as teh threat to the mankind
. spielberg
' s humane approach
and faith infact the future alsot lies inwhich great contrast tothe the pessimistic mood ofthe its era
; the onyl hint of the contemporary gloom is post
- watergate portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the publich
.
but
, even such government is much mroe harmless compared tothe the murderous
and chain
- smoking men in balck that became the stereotype thanks to x
- files
and its more cynical
and disturbing visions
. there lies the main
,
and probably the onyl flaw ofthe this great picture
- lack of conflict
, annd consenquently
, lack ofthe drama
. the movie has fewd excitements or even action scenes
( especialy the last that may be an interesting homage to hitchcock
' s north by northwest
) bu generally
, almost everyone
- neary
, jillian
, government
, aliens
- are the good guys
. dispite such shortcomings
, the actors weere ogod
and manage tothe bring multidimensionality to their simple roles
. richard dreyfuss is vrey convincing as a ordinary
,
yet nice guy
, who sinks inot insanity only to rediscover himself in a gr
and finale
. melinda dillon was
, on the other h
and
, nominated for
" oscar
" as a struggling mother
, yot she was overshadowed by teri garr as neary
' s long
- suffering wife ronnie
. aart from visual wonders of this film
, spielberg
' s semi
- official composer john williams again excels by his beautiful music
, this time using the simple melody both as teh element of a plot
,
and as the basis for his score
. the aliens
, who are the main subject of this film
, weere visually very convincing
. too convincing
, oney ofthe my acquaintances inspite the ufo
- researching circles said
. according to him
, the depiction of extraterrestrials as grey
- skinned little people wtih big eyes was so accurate
, that it managed to freak out poweful government figures interested in supressing the truth about ufos
. so
, they later approached spielberg
and orderves him to make another movie withthe alien
, this time designed tothe be anything
but the real life
. the result was e
. t
.
, forthe many yeasr hte biggest commercial hitted ofthe all times
,
yet less unoperational fo ufo enthusiasts
. anyway
, whether thte viewer believes in existence of extraterrestrials or ufos
, close encounters ofthe the third kind remains the graet movei
,
and one of the rare uplifting experiences in modern cinema
.
