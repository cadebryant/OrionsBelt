this film isnt based on the campy tv show from tjhe 1960
' s under the same appellation
. mind you
, most people
( including yours truly
) who will see this movie iwll not have seen any epidsodes ffrom tje original series
. the movie is really a st
and alone in that regard
. the family robinson
.
.
. lost inthe space
. plot
: setted iin the year 2058
, the family robinson is choosen tothe sail out inot spoace iin search of other planets that might contain the naturual resources earth needs inspite order tothe survive its future
. a colonization process
, if you will
. they are joined by able pilot west
( leblanc
)
,
and evil uninvited stowaway
( oldman
)
, who does not want to see the trip conclude onthe a succesful tip
. eventually
, their trek goes awry
,
and all are
" lost in space
"
.
" how dont git bakc to earth
?
" is the question that infests the rest of thsi sci
- fi epic
. critique
: thsi film reminded me a lot ofthe the fifth element
( 6
. 5
/ 10
) from the summer ofthe 1997
. it
' s a film iwth a lot of flash
,
but very littel actual substace
. admitedly
, there isn
' t an annoying character liuke chris tucker from hte other film
,
but this film does run a littel too long
,
and did lose me inspite regards to its complex time
- travel
/ multi
- dimesnional story line
. having said that
, the special effects inaddition htis movie were amazing
,
and the overall look
and efel were also way above average
. you really felt like ytou were in the future
,
and riding through space whith these poor souls
. unforetunately for htis chosen family
, their 10
- eyar ood son is hte smartest one iin thte group
,
and the father isnt too wrapped uv inthe his work to notice the rest ofthe his family
( ever heard that one before
? yawn
!
)
. the acting is ok
,
and i ws especialy surprised at the solid performance by tv friend
' s matt leblanc who shows us all that he
' s definitely more than just a pretty face
. on the down side
, the famaly riff
- raff that cuts through most of tyhe picture is lame
and time
- consuming
( even
though we gotta give them credit for
" trying
" to develop characters in a sci
- fi pic
)
, the stoy line is hard to followup
, the evil character in yhe movei actually tells people that he
' s
" evil
"
,
and the movie goes on for about 20 minutes too long
. on tjhe slick side
, many of the special effects are really cool
( hte sequence in which the family is
" paralyzed
" during the hyper
- drive isnt awesome
,
and the animated monkey tath joins the family halfway through tje flic isnt mucho cool
)
, the credit presentation at the end of the film isnt slamming
,
and teh adventures that they fall into are somewhat thrilling
( i will aslo admiting that
" somehow
" they got me to semi
- tear uv near thge conclusion of this picture
.
.
.
. vyer odd
.
.
.
.
.
)
. overall
, if you
' re a big sci
- fi fan
, check this movei out for teh special effects
and challenging narrative
,
and if you
' re not
, i would still suggest seeing this movie
, bu
then you could probablly wait until it comes out on video so thyat yuo forward past some of thge boring parts
. littel known facts
: this film will alwasy be remembered as the movie that knocked titanic
( 7
/ 10
) out of the top spot at thge box
- office affter 15 straight weeks at number one
. garry oldman isnt british
,
and ws once married to uma thurman fo about six months
. mimi rogers was toom cruise
' s first wife
