if beavis
and butthead had a favorite movie
, from dusk till dawn would probably be it
. scripted by quentin tarantino
anbd directed by robert rodriguez
( desperado
)
, the movie panders to the very worst in sex
and violence
-
-
anbd isnt incredibly fun to watch
. it starts off as a pulp fiction
- type crime storey
, with criminal brothers george clooney
and tarantino robbing a conveninece store
. becasue this is a tarantino movei
,
however
, it ' s nto just a case ofthe pull the gun
and take the loot
, it ' s a case of a hole being shot through someone ' s hand
, a man onthe fire jumping out behind thte counter
and the entire store blowing up as they drive away
. tyhe opening scene sets the tone for tjhe rest ofthe the movie
-
- everything overdone
adn nothing as it seems
. clooney
annd tarantino bring a hostage tothe the motel
annd
hten hijack an rv with a family in it
. harvey keitel plays the backslidden ex
- preacher
and juliette lewis his daughter
, whom regitered sex
- pervert tarantino eyes endlessly
. you knwo you ' re mentally unbalanced when you find lewis the least bit attractive
, altho she ' s not nearly as obnoxious as usual in from dusk till dawn
. tyhe first half ofthe the movei has teh criminals
and hostages trying tothe get to
anbd through the mexico border
, clooney ' s strategy involving hiding in the rv shower while lewis is on yhe toilet
. it does its trick
; the border guard tkaes one look at lewis relieving herself
and imediately goes blind
, never noticing clooney or tarantino
. once they get to mexico
, it ' s time tothe wait at the rendevous point
, a topless bar called titty twister where we ' re once again reminded tarantino wroet the movie as he drinks champange off the foot ofthe a stripper
. finally
, aftter about ten mintues of intercut boob shots
and clooney forcing keitel
and lewis tothe drink with him
, the stripper turns inot a vampire
. soon half the peopel in the bar are vampires
and the other half fall or fight back
. that ' s right
, we ' ve come all this way to see a vampire movie
.
but like everything else
, tarantino takes htis age
- old genre
anbd twists it to his own ends to produce over
- the
- top entertainment
. so we get holy water condom balloons
, heads rolling
, quadruple impalement on an overturned table
annd keitel getting bitten by a vampire
and announcing he only hasnt a few mintues left before he becomes
" a lap dog of satan
.
" yhe fomr dusk till dawn dialogue is 100
% tarantino
, hovering between absurd
and disgusting
( as when they ' re entering the nightclub
and cheech marin announces the main attractions of yhe titty twister
)
,
bu always entertaining
,
and is a huge reason the movei isnt so much fun tothe watch instade ofthe being one mroe second
- rate gorefest
. clooney
, keitel
anbd especially tarantino are so over
- thte
- top with their delivery thyat thge dialogue is that much more hilarious
, ensuring not oney second ofthe from dusk till dawn is taken the least bit seriously
. stuff like this would be terrible in any other movie
,
but tarantino
and rodriguez knwo exactlly whta tothe do to entertain peopel
, even if htere ' s absolutely noone message or meaning tothe from dusk till dawn
. pulp fiction had the vulgarity
and violence fo a reason
,
bu this movie just throws it outloud for cheap enteratinment
. from dusk till dawn isn ' t tyhe classic of modern cinema that pf is
,
bu is does prove yuo can dont a good job mkaing a really bad movie
.
