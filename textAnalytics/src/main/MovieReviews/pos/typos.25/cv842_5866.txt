if beavis adn
butthead had a favorite movie
, from dusk till dawn would probably be it
. scripted by quentin tarantino
and directed by robert rodriguez
( desperado
)
, the movie p
anders to the very worst in sex anbd violence
-
-
and isnt incredibly fun to watch
. it starts off as a pulp fiction
- type crime story
, with criminal brothers george clooney
and tarantino robbing a convenience store
. because htis is a tarantino movie
,
however
, it
' s nto just a case of pul the gun
and take the loot
, it
' s a case of a hole being shot through someone
' s h
and
, a man onthe fier jumping out behind the counter annd the entire store blowing up as they drive awya
. the opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie
-
- everthing overdone
and nothing as it seems
. clooney adn tarantino bring a hostage to the motel
and
then hijack an rv with a famaly in it
. harvey keitel plays yhe backslidden ex
- preacher
and juliette lewis his daughter
, whom registreed sex
- pervert tarantino eyes endlessly
. you know you
' re mentally unbalanced whn you find lewis thge least bit attractive
,
al
though she
' s not nearly as obnoxious as usual iin from dusk till dawn
. the first half ofthe yhe movie has hte criminals
and hostages trying to get to
and through the mexico border
, clooney
' s strategy involving hiding in the rv shower while lewis is onthe the toilet
. it does its trick
; the border guard takes one look at lewis relieving herself annd immediately goes blind
, never noticing clooney or tarantino
. once they get to mexico
, it
' s time to wait at the rendezvous point
, a topless bar called titty twister where we
' re once again reminded tarantino wrote thge movie as he drinks champagne off the foot of a stripper
. fianlly
, after about ten minutes ofthe intercut boob shots
and clooney forcing keitel anbd lewis to drnik with him
, the stripper turns inot a vampire
. soon half the people inwhich tghe bar are vampires
and the other half fall or fight back
. tht
' s right
, we
' ve cmo all this way tothe see a vampire movie
.
but like everyting eles
, tarantino takes this age
- old genre adn twists it to his own ends to produce over
- tyhe
- top entertainment
. so we git holy water condom balloons
, heads rolling
, quadruple impalement onthe an overturned table
and keitel getting bitten by a vampire anbd announcing he only has a few minutes left before he becomes
" a lap dog ofthe satan
.
" the ffrom dusk till dawn dialogue isnt 100
% tarantino
, hovering bewteen absurd
and disgusting
( as when they
' re entering teh nightclub adn cheech marin announces the main atractions of the titty twister
)
,
but always entertaining
,
and is a huge reason the movie is so much funn tothe watch instade of being oney more second
- rate gorefest
. clooney
, keitel
and especially tarantino are so over
- the
- top with their delivery thgat the dialogue isnt that much more hilarious
, ensuring nto one second of from dusk till dawn is taked the least bit seriously
. stuff like this would be terrible in any otehr movie
,
but tarantino adn rodriguez knwo exactly waht to do to entertain people
, even if there
' s absolutely no message or meaning tothe from dusk till dawn
. pulp fiction had the vulgarity anbd violence for a reason
, bu this movie just throws it outloud for cheap enteratinment
. from dusk till dawn isn
' t the classic ofthe modern cinema that pf isnt
,
but is does prove you can dont a ogod job making a relaly bad movei
.
