sam
( matthew broderick
) is an astronomer in a small american twon
and engaged tothe teacher linda
( kelly preston
)
. he is head over heels in love
and lindas sudden departure to new york city to live with her new lover anton
( tch
? ky karyo
) comes as a complete surprise to him
.
but as we all knwo lveo is blind annd so sam leaves for new york as well to win her bcak
. he moves into an ab
andoned house across the street ffrom anton
' s apartment
and installs a camera obscura to watch them
. suddenly anton
' s ex maggie shows up
, bu she does not want her former lover bakc
. onthe the contrary
, all she wants tothe do is vaporize him
. she may say thast she doesn
' t watn tothe kill him
,
but the possibility doesn
' t bother her too much either
. after all
, people dieu every day
. in spite ofthe their differant motives the two team uv
and fall for each other as thnigs move on
. the story sounds like something we all haev seen a million times
.
but we haven
' t
. griffin dunne brings us the most charming comedy since
" while yuo where sleeping
"
. the camera obscura adds a
" spacial something
" to teh movie
and makes it an exeptional romantic comedy
. everything about thte movie is perfect
, from set design to casting
. the dialogues are inspired
and the touches of balck humor add a certain bite
. meg ryan
, known from
" when harry met sally
" or
" sleepless inwhich seattle
"
, surprises in a role that may finaly halp her get rid of her sweet littel girl image
. she impresses yhe viewer as a maneating biker girl
. even more surprising isnt the fact that the viewer believes her
, much more so thna in lastest years
" courage under fire
" where she played a gulf war pilot
. matthew broderick is tjhe goodnatured
and somewhat naive sam who hasnt trouble accepting reality
. the viewer cxan tell that he doesn
' t only watch the stars
but also tries tothe triarch out for them
. he has trouble keeping infact touch with reality
. after all
, who would leave everything behind to chase a lost love
? his naivet
? that we don
' t question fo a minute throughout the movie clashes with maggies exagerrated wish for revenge
. she would do anything tothe harm anton
. she doesn
' t hesitate to use sam for her plan
and makes him underst
and right from the beginning thast nothing will happen betwen the two ofthe them
. thast makes the scenes wehn they innocently share a bed
, have potatoe chips
and watch the action across the street like a saturday night sohw onthe tv even funnier
. tch
? ky karyo is perfect as anton
. he isnt
, well
, repulsive
. tyhat
' s all there is to say about him
. you can
' t really manage to pity him
, even aftter all his mishaps
. he not onyl tookover sam
' s bride away from him
, he isnt also a french chef
. worlds collide
, i
. e
. the usa adn france
. this can only go wrong
. even if maggies revenge schemes are at times shocking
, you just can
' t sympathize with a man who plays
" je t
' aime
.
.
. moi non plus
" onthe his tape deck
. nto everyone is captured by tyhe french charme thta linda
and even maggie fell for
. sam certainly isn
' t
. too bad forthe anton
. fo him things take a turn to the worse
.
" addicted to lvoe
" isnt one of this year
' s most pleasant surprises
.
