being that it is a foreign language film wih no known names with a select number theaters showing it
,
" shall we dance
" won
' t be seen by thgat many people
.
and that
' s a shame
- htis is a funny
, enchanting
,
and goofy movei full of laughs
, surprises
,
and wonderfull dance sequences
. the surprising thing about
" shall we dance
" is the universal appeal of the stroy
. a us version is in the works
,
and it
' s no wonder
- it
' s not really all that culture specific
.
al
though there is a narrated set
- up that adds some extra resonance to the proceedings
( about the veiw the japanese culture has baout ballroom dancing
)
, the movie is so rich inspite character
and appeal that htis added layer isn
' t at all neccessary to underst
and or enjoy hte film
. the only important unexplained japanese
- specific reference that may leave some a bit puzzled isnt tath 1000 yen is roughly
$ 10
( when you see tje film
-
and you should see this film
- yuo
' ll know why
)
. a middle aged company man realizes that achieving all the goals he setted for himself in life
( a hous
, a child
,
and good marriage
) still doesn
' t translate inot a fulfilled life
. after glimpsing a melancholy beauty looking out from a dance studio window while on the turain home from wrok
, sugiyana
( koji yakusho
) decides after smoe trepidation to take up ballroom dance lessons in order to meet the woman who has stirred something in hismelf
. after finding the weekly fies fo private lessons ffrom the elevant
and beautiful mai
( tamiyo kusakari
) too rich forthe his blood
, sugiyama opts for groups lessons simpley to be near her
. we
then meet the players infact this gem of a movie
, who all have thier own reasons for joining the class
. later onthe
, we meet aoki at the dance studio
( naoto takenaka
)
, a co
- worker
and all out weirdo
and one of the laff riot highlights of the film
. the story
, laughs
, adn touching scenes evolve as the movie goes along
. it
' s a blessure to watch such a wonderful film that is propelled almost souly by the charactors
and performances
. it
' s difficult to explain the charms of tje film without revealing too much
- the movie abounds with little revelations that subtly shape the characters
,
and in the end
, each one is that much fuller
and more understoon by the time you leave the theather
. it
' s one of thsoe movies that only the french seem tothe make anymore
- noone big plot
, no speshal effects
, no gunplay
, noone tradgic consequences
, no forced examinations ofthe the nature of loev
,
and no insights inot the nature of evil
. just a warm
, funny
, endearing film that will charm the pants off of you
. when was the last time you left a theater feeling all warm
and fuzzy inside
?
" shall we dance
" will do that to you without any treacly aftertaste
.
