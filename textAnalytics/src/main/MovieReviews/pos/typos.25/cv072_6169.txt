the long kiss goodnight
( r
) meryl streep tried it
and failed
. even pamela
anderson lee made an attemp
but fell flat on her well
- bared assets
.
however
, geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female acation star wtih the long kiss goodnight
, a preposterous bu incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husb
and
, renny harlin
. davis plays samantha caine
, a mousy suburban school teacher
and mother whose memories onyl go back eight years
. with the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, she slowly remembers
-
-
and reclaims
-
- her past as charly baltimore
, tough
- as
- nails cia operative
. needless to say
, with teh reappearance ofthe samantha
/ charly comes the appearance of an assortment of noone
- goodniks out to erase more tahn her memory
. shane black netted a cool
$ 4 mil for his script
; i
' m not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag
,
but for what it
' s worth
, it delivers the goods
. like black
' s previvous work
, such as lethal weapon
and the last boy scout
, the script juggles some impressive acation scenes whith funny
, quirky dialogue
. the humor especially works well in this case
, for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things from taking things too seriously
. bu there
' s noone arument that tje mroe unbelievable sequences are original
and entertaining as hell
: who can resist yhe sighth of davis tossing her daugter fomr a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car
.
.
. while ice skating
? jackson
and davis make a good team
. jackson is funny as ever as ever
; in fact
, his spirited line deliveries
, especially whn he frist appears
, are more than reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction
. as ogod as he isnt
, the one who should benefit the most from this project is davis
, who shows much promise as an action heroine
. wqat makes her so effective annd why she shoudl succede where streep
and lee failed is that she doesn
' t take herself too seriously
. she is obviously in onthe the joke
, slyly taking jabs at herself
and at tje situation
. this is not to say that she doesn
' t need work
-
- sometimes she lays on the
" toughness
" a bit too thick adn comes off too much as a caricature
.
but should the public embrace the film
and
, in turn
, the notion of a kick
- ass female
, davis could hvae found her speical niche
. it seems as if davis
and harlin
' s first collaboration
, the middling pirate epic cutthroat isl
and
, was jstu a dress rehearsal
( albeit a vrey costly one
) for long kiss
, in which the wife
- husban team hit their action stride
. anyone simply looking forthe a fun
, escapist entertainment thta requires littel
- to
- noone thinking will find this film to be a more
- than
- welcome kiss
.
