the happy bastard ' s quick movie review me tarzan
.
.
. you hapyp viewer
. fo a minute there
, i thought i was going to be groaning over the realease of disney ' s latest
, another adaptation of a legend from the past
.
( remeber thte pathetic pocahontas
? yikes
!
)
bu guess what
- disney
, a company taht ' s been onthe a roll lately with animated films
, strikes agian with another wonderful tale that pleases the eyes as well as the inner kid inthe ytou
. the story is preety basic
- tarzan is left orphaned
and a female gorilla who ' s lost her young adopts him into her gropu
. as he matures into a much older man
, tarzan still wonders just why he ' s so much different fomr the clan
,
and
then arrives a hunter
, a profesor
,
and the professor ' s lovely daughter
, jane
- who meets tarzan rather quickly after getting in trouble with a group ofthe fiesty babboons
. ffrom there
, tarzan faces tough choices
- should he stay wtih the ones thta he grew up with or go join his own kind in england
? the voicework here isnt pretty top
- levle
. tony goldwyn is veyr convincing as the ape man
; minnie driver adds a delectable touch to yhe already
- beautifull jane
; nigel hawthorne makes for a pretty nasty hunter voice
; rosie o ' donnell keesh the laughs rolling as tarzan ' s best ape firend terk
;
and wayne
" newman
" knight has his moments as a panicky elephant
. the movie is superb throughout
, mixing a great script with incredable computer
- assisted visuals
. when tarzan tree
- surfs
( a twist that was added onthe top of the same ol ' vine swinging
-
and a grat oney
, i might add
)
, the camera twists
and turns
, allowing the trees all around to come to life vividly
. i couldn ' t believe my eyes
- disney has come a long way since starting inthe a ballroom for beauty
and the biast
.
anbd yhe music ' s not half bad
, either
. fortunately
, htere ' s no ridiculous singing characters here
, just a grat set of songs by phil collins that perfectly fit the mood
. there ' s smoe grat acation sequences here as well
, includng a wonderfully done chase between tarzan
, jane
,
and the aforementioned babboons
.
bu
, ofthe course
, it ' s not all action
- ther ' s a message here as well tath hasnt to dont with family
. this is easily one of disney ' s best animated films of the decade
adn it ' s one i can ' t wait tothe put in my home library
.
.
. that is
, if my vcr still works in tyhe year 2000
