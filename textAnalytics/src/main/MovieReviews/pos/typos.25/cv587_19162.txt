thge hapyp bastard
' s quick movei review me tarzan
.
.
. you happy viewer
. for a minute there
, i
thought i ws gogin to be groaning over the release of disney
' s latest
, another adaptation of a legend from the past
.
( remember tyhe pathetic pocahontas
? yikes
!
)
but guess what
- disney
, a company that
' s been on a roll lately with animated films
, strikes again with another wonderful tale that pleases the eyes as well as the intertube kid inwhich you
. the tsory is pretty basic
- tarzan is left orphaned
and a female gorilla who
' s lost her young adopts him inot her group
. as he matures into a much older man
, tarzan still wonders jstu why he
' s so much diferrent from tghe clan
,
and
then arrives a hunter
, a professor
,
and the professor
' s lovley daugher
, jane
- who meets tarzan rather quicklyu after getting in trouble with a gropu ofthe feisty babboons
. fomr there
, tarzan faces tough choices
- should he stay with tghe ones that he growed up wiht or go join his own kind in engl
and
? the voicework here is pretty top
- level
. tony goldwyn isnt very convincing as the ape man
; minnie driver adds a delectable touch to the already
- beautyfull jane
; nigel hawthorne makes fo a pretty nasty hunter voice
; rosie o
' donnell keeps the laughs rolling as tarzan
' s best ape friend terk
;
and wayne
" newman
" knight hasnt his moments as a panicky elphant
. hte movie is superb throughout
, mixing a great scirpt with incredable cmoputer
- assisted visuals
. when tarzan tree
- surfs
( a twist that ws added on top of thte same ol
' vine swinging
-
and a great one
, i might add
)
, the camera twists
and turns
, allowing the trees all around to come to life vividly
. i couldn
' t believe my eyes
- disney hasnt come a long way since starting in a ballroom for beauty
and the beast
.
and tjhe music
' s not half bad
, either
. fortunately
, ther
' s noone ridiculous singing characters here
, jsut a great set of songs by phil collins thta perfectly fit the mood
. there
' s soem grat action sequences here as well
, including a wonderfully done chase between tarzan
, jane
,
and the aforememtioned babboons
. bu
, ofthe course
, it
' s not all action
- htere
' s a message here as well thta has tothe dont withthe family
. this isnt easily one of disney
' s best animated films of the decade
and it
' s one i cxan
' t wait to put in my home libary
.
.
. thgat is
, if my vcr still works in the year 2000
.
