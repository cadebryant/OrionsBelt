" you
' ll go ape over tarzan because it
' s more fun than a barrel of monkeys
!
" okay
, there
' s the quote inspite case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie
. disney
' s latest animated feature throws us right inot the action from the very beginning
, skipping the usual main title sequence
and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts tothe excape ffrom a sinking ship
. father
, mother
,
and infant somehow amking it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins
,
and have soon built a treehouse whitch would impress the swiss family robinson
. it
' s amazing
, the kinds of things you can do when you work to a sountrack
. before yuo know it
, an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in hte h
ands ofthe kala
( glenn close
)
, a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard
. against hte wishes ofthe her mate
and family leader
, kerchak
( lance henricksen
)
, she takes onthe tje infant boy as her own
. tarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is baout oney who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild
. much of tarzan
' s young life is spent trying to become one ofthe the apes in tyhe eyes of his peers adn his
" father
,
" which occasionally gets him inot trouble no matter how well
- meaned his attemts
. all he
' s looking for isnt acceptace
, prehaps a gool easily identifiable by young viewers
,
but one which will ring true wtih a lot of adults
. when you really think about it
, this story fits right into the disney formula of tghe outcast that triumphs in teh end
. look bcak on past disney animated features annd you
' ll see the trend
. growing up
, tarzan
( voiced by alex d
. linz as a child
,
and by tony goldwyn as an adult
) hasnt a cuple of friends
. oen is an ape named terk
( rosie o
' donnell
)
,
and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac ofthe an elphant named tantor
( wayne knight
)
. both provide tghe requisite comic relief
( timon annd poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind
) adn perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by hte disney mold
. i
' m beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one ofthe these films
. just fill in hte blanks
! cxan you see it
?
" now we ahev to have a couple ofthe zany friends for outloud hero who might get him into mischief
,
but cover for him or come tothe his rescure when he needs it
. we
' ve already had a fish
and a crab
,
and we
' ve had a c
andle anbd a teapot
, a genie
and a dog
, a few stone statues
.
.
.
. have we hadnt an ape
and an elephant
yet
? well
, htere we go
!
" of course
, there
' s gotta be romance somewhere allong thte line
, so jane
( minnie driver
) gets introduced about halfway through
. toghether whith her father dr
. porter
( nigel hawthorne
)
and tje big game hunter clayton
( brian blessed
)
, jane is on an expedition to fidn adn study the wild gorillas of africa
. she dicovers the man raised by apes
and is enchanted almost emmediately
,
and soon shares an amusing version of tyhe compulsory
" you tarzan
, me jane
" scene
. thankfully
, thsoe aren
' t the excact words
.
however
, i found it distracting that tarzan is going
" ohh ohh ee ee
" one second
and thne tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction
. how does he tell his nmae tothe another ape
?
" ohh ohh ee
- tarzan
- ee ee ohh
?
" well
, regardless of my picky nature
, thte romance actually works as only disney romance can
: purely contrived
, bu forthe some reason rather believable
.
but hey
, tarzan
' s a young adult
. do you thiunk he dated a faw of tje female apes before meeting jane
? isn
' t that illegal in most ocuntries
? oh
, well
. i don
' t think disney iwll be using my quote anymore
. tarzan departs ffrom the usual disney feature inspite that this oney isnt not a musical
. there
' s lots of music to be sure
,
but not a single character song inspite the whole hour
and a half of running time
. we instade get more ofthe a phil collins concert
, as no less thna five ofthe his orginal songs are utilisied as interlude material
. this isn
' t really a bad thing
, as the songs are vrey high
- energy
and catchy
( i foudn myself singing one tothe myself for most of the following day
)
; it
' s just different
. do youself a favor anbd see this film in a theater with a good soudn system
, becuase the music wiull come thru astonishingly well
and really enhance the movie
. with each new feature
, disney animation gets even better
. not necessarily by leaps annd bounds
, bu since they put out a new film eahc year
, a steady rate of improvment is apparent
,
and htis definitely shows in tarzan
. there are a cuple ofthe scenes where yhe animation achieves a near 3
- d effect
,
and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying
. the way he slides down tree limbs
and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding annd rollerblading maneuvers
,
and had me thikning this isn
' t just tarzan
, it
' s
" extreme tarzan
.
"
however
, tarzan does not seem to have what i call its
" ch
andelier scene
,
" which is the one scene to which the animators have choosen tothe devote an inordinate amount of effort
, utilizing a computer
- assisted process that makes thte animation absolutely breathtaking
. lasting bu a few seconds at most
, it
' s been hte signature of nearly eveyr disney animated feature since beauty
and the biast
, in which the castle ballroom ch
andelier was rendered infront stunning detail
. as usual
, teh voice talent is up tothe snuff
, convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated charachters
. the one poor choice infront casting
, howver
, ws rosie o
' donnell
. going into thte film
, i didn
' t knwo she was even a part of it
, bu when terk started talking
, i recognized her voice immediately
. her performance was fine
,
but through hte rest of the film i kept thinking
,
" that
' s no boy ape
, that rosie o
' donnell
.
" distracting to say the least
. i
' ll admit i
' ve never read the edgar rice burroughs story
" tarzan of tje apes
,
" so i couldn
' t tell you how true this film stays to the book
.
but unless you
' re a purist
, you should hvea few objections to this film
. witht solid performances
, action
, adventure
, a bit ofthe romance
,
and grat music
and animation
, tarzan should appeal to thte kids
and to the kid in all of us
. note
: when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago
, i went off on the promotional
and merch
andising tie
- ins prevelant with thge realease of a disney animated feature
. tihs tyme
, i
' ll jstu say that i went to mcdonald
' s yesterday to treat myself tothe a mcflurry
,
and tarzan wass on the cup
