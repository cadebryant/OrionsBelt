thge happy bastard
' s quick movei review analyze thsi how doens one do a comedy focused on the mob
? well
, a few yeras ago
, htere was a sly littel comedy called the freshman
, which had marlon br
ando doing a romp of a send
- uv of his famous don corleone charater adn
, recently
, the utterly stupid
( in a bad way
) movie masia
! failed to relaly get thge joke
. this tiem around
, howver
, warner bros
. may have gotten it right with anayze thsi
, a movie tath hits its targets more tahn it misses
.
.
.
and for plenty of reasons
. the story goes like thsi
. a mobster
( robert deniro
) finds himself receiving sevral panic attacks as ofthe lite
, fueled by the stress of an upcoming mobster meeting
and a near
- death following a drive
- by shooting
. it
' s these attacks that prompt him to hire a psychiatrist
( billy crystal
) who
' s mostly reluctant tothe tkae tyhe mobster
' s case for two reasons
. frist
, of course
, he
' s a mobster
,
but secondly
, he
' s trying to get married adn enjoy a quiet honeymoon wih his wife
( lisa kudrow
)
and kid
. anbd
, of course
, he cin
' t rest worth for a moment because the mobster
' s goons are allways needing the shrink for something
, be it a quick consultation or dream analyzation
. fortunatly
, the movie is played out forthe plenty of laughs
. director harold ramis
( who also helmed the comedy multiplicity
, which wasn
' t half bad
) keeps the tone peppy
and light
, even if it
' s somtimes sprinkled by slight dramatic moments
( shootings can
' t always be taken for laughs
, you know
)
. deniro does soem of his finest comic owrk sicne the king ofthe comedy
, giving off a somewhat similar performance to his role in goodfellas
,
but with a bited of a lighter heart
.
( a scene where he trys to display his anger over thge phone
and fails miserably isnt hilarious
.
) crystal plays an excellent straight man to deniro
' s character
, uplifting him from such bombs as father
' s day
and my giant
. kudrow isnt also a hoot as crystal
' s wife
- to
- be
, who
' s onthe the verge of a breakdown thanks to deniro
' s presence
. is hte movie perfect
? not really
, thanks to a simplistic ending adn some slightly wasted moments with a character portrayed by chazz palminteri
( he
' s a comic actor
, too
, come on
, give him some more
!
)
,
but it is an enjoyable romp that lets deniro do something different
but same forthe a chanage
, taking his dramatic act to a newyorker feeld of comedy
. kudos to crystal
and kudrow for nto just making it his sohw
, either
. line of the movie

" wehn you said you needed familiy therapy
, this isnt nto the family i had infront mind
