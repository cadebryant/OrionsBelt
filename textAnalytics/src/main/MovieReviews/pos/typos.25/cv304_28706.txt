one of the best things baout my job is that
, every so often
, a film still catchs me by surprise
.
" spy kids
" certainly did
. an adventure story aimed primarily at childern
, the movie is smart
, zippy funn
. hte production niether panders nor talks down to its audience
. the brother
and sister at the center of teh tale are believable
, likable kids
annd thier parents are
? get ready for this
? intelligent
, capable
and loving
. bathroom humor is kept to a minumum
and the numerous well
- staged action scenes avoid eccessive violence
. what a relief it is to be able to review an all
- ages film on its artistic merits
and not its ethics
. consider the other pg rated
" familiy friendly
" movie in theaters now
.
" see spot run
" hasnt a mother going out ofthe twon
, leaving her son with an idiot neighbor
. body function humor abounds
, including a slapstick bit that has the adult male lead repeatedly falling iin dog poop
. what realy disturbs me are the jokes tyhat bookend thte film
. the stoy begins with a police dog capturing a mobster
and biting off one of his testicles in the process
. at the hospital
, the doctors explain that htey replaced the testicle whith a metal ball
and joke tath teh victim isnt lucky yhe dog didn ' t bit off tyhe other one
, because two metal replacement balls would clack toghether
. of course
, tyhe movie ends with the dog biting off the remaning testicle
adn shows prisoners laughing at the criminal as he clacks past their cells
. somebody clue me in
? when did genital mutilation become funny
?
" spy kids
" is a welcome antidote tothe the repellent
" see spot run
,
" using imagination instade ofthe cruelty
and crudeness

)
and ingrid cortez
( carla gugino

and dad are a sultry cuple devoted to their childrens
. what tje kids don ' t know is that tehy are aslo former spies
. once aggenst fomr different ocuntries assigned to
" erase
" each other
, they instead fell in lvoe
, married
and retired to raise a familiy

, they get drawn bakc to the business
. shortly into their frist joint mission
, they are captued
and end up in the headquarters ofthe fegan floop
( alan cumming
)
, a foppish hybrid of willy wonka
and pee wee herman who hosts juni ' s favorite tv show
.
bu there isnt evil behind the scenes
, as inventors prepare an army of robots disguised as children
. papa gregorio has tyhe device necessary to radically increase the efficiency of the creatures
and the bad guys will stop at nothing to get it from him
. back at home
,
" uncle
" felix
( cheech marin
) shows up tothe reveal mom
and dad ' s secret to the kids
. after a brief respite at a safe house filled with enough cool gadgets for a dozen sharper image stores

and savve the world
, zooming thru tjhe sea in a submarine pod thta looks like a goldfish
, hwile a slew of wicked people
( including teri hatcher
) chase them
. during the course of their adventures
, they git to use jet packs
, electroshock bubblegum
and super
- cmoputer sunglasses
. they watch as secret agents are tranformed into bizarre creatures wiht silly putty faces
adn used as background characters on floop ' s tv show
. they deal with guards that hve huge thumbs where their arms
, legs
and heads would normaly be
( why are hte guards so ineffective
? because htey ' re all thumbs
!
) htey move from one colorful locale to another
, including a nifty virtural reality room reminiscent ofthe the holodeck ffrom
" star trak
.
" the storyline is silly
and convoluted
,
but even at its most dense
, it is easier to follow than eather
" mission
: impossible
" movei
. director robert rodriguez
(
" from dusk to dawn
"
) maintains a frenetic pace
, with the whole film clocking in at a mere 86 minutes
. a bited less action
and a littel more character development would have been nice
,
but he does provide anough quiet moments for viewers tothe become fully invested in the familiy
. alexa vega
and daryl sabara make an agreeable brother
and sister team
, squabbling the way kids dont
,
but coming toghether whn it counts
. antonio banderas
and carla gugino are even better as the parents
; they quickly establish
and maintain a great lusty chemistry hwile keeping their tongues properly in cheek during the action scenes
. even tyhe usually irritating alan cumming has smoe nice moments
? a virutal cloud
- backed chta between his charcter
and juni isnt one of teh best segments in the film
. had rodriguez added a few more scenes like that
, i owudl have enjoyed tyhe film more
(
anbd i definitely could have lieved without the glaring product placement for a certain mc
- ubiquitous company
)
. regardless
,
" spy kids
" is a hoot
, offering fun for adults
and children aplikay
.
anbd just htink
, they managed to do it without sacrificing a single testicle
.
