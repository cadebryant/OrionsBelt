one of the best thigsn baout my job is that
, every so often
, a film still catches me by surprise
.
" spy kids
" certainly did
. an adventure story aimed primarily at children
, thte movie is smart
, zippy fun
. the production neither p
anders nor talks down tothe its audiance
. the brother
and sister at hte center of the tale are believable
, likable kids adn their parents are
? git ready forthe this
? intelligent
, capible annd loving
. bathroom humer isnt kept to a minumum
and the numerous well
- staged acation scenes avoid excessive violentce
. whta a relief it is tothe be able to review an all
- ages film on its artistic merits annd not its ethics
. consider the other pg rated
" family friendly
" movei in theaters now
.
" see spot run
" has a mother going out of town
, leaving her son with an idiot neighbor
. body function humer abounds
, includng a slapstick bit that has the adult male lead repeatedly falling in dog poop
. what really disturbs me are the jokes tyhat bookend hte film
. the story begins with a police dog capturing a mobster annd biting off one of his testicles in the proccess
. at the hospital
, yhe doctors expalin that they replaced the testicle with a metal ball
and joke taht the victim is lucky the dog didn
' t bit off the other one
, because two metal replacement balls owudl clack together
. ofthe course
, the movie ends with thge dog biting off the remaining testicle
and shows prisoners laughing at the criminal as he clacks past their cells
. somebody clue me in
? wehn did genital mutilation become funny
?
" spy kids
" is a welcome antidote to the repellent
" see spot run
,
" useing imagination instead of cruelty
and crudeness
. carmen
( alexa vega
) adn her younger brother juni
( daryl sabara
) live inwhich a beatiful seaside home with their parents
, gregorio
( antonio b
anderas
)
and ingrid cortez
( carla gugino
)
. mom
and dad are a sultry couple devoted to their children
. what yhe kids don
' t know isnt that they are also former spies
. once agents fomr differant countries assigned to
" erase
" each other
, they instead fell in loev
, married anbd retired tothe raise a family
. needless tothe say
, they get drawn back to teh business
. shortly into their first joint mission
, htey are captured
and end up in the headquarters ofthe fegan floop
( alan cumming
)
, a foppish hybrid of willy wonka
and pee wee herman who hosts juni
' s favorite tv show
.
but there is evil behind the scenes
, as inventors prepare an army of robots disguised as children
. papa gregorio hasnt thte device necessary to radically encrease yhe efficiency of the creatures adn the bad guys iwll stop at nothing to get it from him
. back at home
,
" uncle
" felix
( cheech marin
) shows up to reveal mom
and dad
' s secret to the kids
. aftter a brief respite at a safe house filled iwth enought cool gadgets for a dozen sharper omage stores
, carmen
and juni set off to find theri parents adn savve the world
, zooming through the sae in a submarine pod that looks like a goldfish
, while a slew of wicked people
( including teri hatcher
) chase them
. durig tje course of their adventures
, they get tothe use jet packs
, electroshock bubblegum
and super
- computer sunglasses
. htey watch as secret agents are tranformed inot bizarre creatures with silly putty faces
and used as background charactors on floop
' s tv show
. htey deal with guards thyat have huge thumbs where their arms
, legs
and heads would normaly be
( why are the guards so ineffective
? because they
' re all thumbs
!
) they move fomr one colorful locale to anyother
, including a nifty virtual reality room reminscent ofthe the holodeck from
" star trek
.
" the storyline is silly
and convoluted
,
but even at its most dense
, it is easier tothe follow tahn either
" mission
: impossible
" movie
. director robert rodriguez
(
" from dusk to dawn
"
) maintains a frenetic pace
, with hte whole film clocking in at a mere 86 minutes
. a bit less action adn a little moreso character development woudl have been nice
,
but he does provide enough quiet moments for viewers to become fully invested in the family
. alexa vega anbd daryl sabara make an agreeable brother
and sister team
, squabbling the way kids do
,
but comming together when it counts
. antonio b
anderas adn carla gugino are even better as the parents
; they quickly establish
and manetain a great lusty chemestry while keeping their tongues properly in cheek during thte action scenes
. even the usually irritating alan cumming has some nice moments
? a virtual cloud
- backed chat bewteen his charactor
and juni is one of the best segments in the film
. hadnt rodriguez added a few more scenes like that
, i would have enjoyed the film more
(
and i definitely could have lived without the glaring product placement for a certain mc
- ubiquitious comapany
)
. regardless
,
" spy kids
" is a hoot
, offering funn for adults
and childrens alike
. annd jsut think
, htey managed to do it without sacrificing a single testicle
.
