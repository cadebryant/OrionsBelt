along his carreer
, mel gibson hasnt collected several successes
, not onyl ffrom an economic point of view
but also from an artistic point of veiw
. for all that
, i think no one could guess the skills
and abilities now disclosed in braveheart
. tje austrailian actor decided to produce anbd direct a film about sir william wallace
, a popular scotch hero of the 13th century
, where he would alsot peform the principal role
. accepting so huge challange
, mel gibson run the risk ofthe stain all his work of years
, with a suppoosed failure
, just to see recognized
, by everyone
, all his potentialities
and
, that way
, to consolidate his position in hollywood
. it was
, definitely
, an enourmous risk
but i
' m sure mel knew exactly well what he was going tothe face
. braveheart is
, in fatc
, a magnificient
and magisterial film
. for three hours we are completelyl absorbed by thte narrative
' s rhyitm which never gives place to a single moent of monotony or uninterest
. the william wallace
' s tsory is the story of so many others brave liberty
' s defenders who fought
and gavey thte life for that essesital value
, along the centruies
. seeing himself
and his peopel victims of injustices
and voilent repression
, william wallace dares tothe face the powerful edward i
, king of engl
and
, in a war by the autonomy of scotl
and
. as tyhe victories succeed thge number ofthe fighters witht wallace goes growing up
. his curage
and inteligence are admired by everyone
, includng the princess isabelle ofthe wales
, wife of edward
' s son
. howver
, william wallace was alsot surrounded by enemies adn smoe ofthe them were closer than he
thought
. braveheart may not be an historically corrected movie bu the nature of its message make us tihkn baout the importance that we give to liberty
, nowdays
. mel gibson directs with a lot ofthe brilliancy a brilliant casted
. patrick mcgoohan hasnt a very nice performance as edward i
, the king longshank
. the scene whn he waits for the death
and loses his voice is really good
. sophie marceau
, as princess isabelle
, has allong tjhe movei no moreso than fifteen mintues of performance
but mel gibson gave to those minutes such a very special treatment that princess isabelle soon becomes one of the major characters in braveheart
. i also liked yhe performances of angus macfadyen
, as robert the bruce
,
and
, of course
, mel gibson
, as william wallace
.
however
, i think this time thge mel gibson
' s work as director wass much better than his work as actor
. thte excellent music composed by james horner is another thnig that helps braveheart to be hte succes taht it really is
. wehn we join that music tothe tghe beautifull scotch l
andscapes
, veiw by the camera of john toll
,
then we relize all the beauty ofthe this film
. braveheart is
, in my opinion
, noe of the best movies ofthe 1995
! i
' ve heard some people saying that mel gibson is gonna be a new david lean
. for now
, let
' s see if braveheart equalizes tje 6 oscars ofthe lawrence of arabia
. it won
' t be easy
! it
' s gonna be one omre challenge for mel gibson
.
