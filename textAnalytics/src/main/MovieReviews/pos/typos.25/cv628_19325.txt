:
` tarzan
' beautiful to look at
, easy to follow
. review
: disney continues its trend of producing animated summer blockbuster movies meant mostly fo children
but with enough witn
and charm forthe adults to be interested adn at least entertained by the stopry
. the basic premise is the same as eveyr other
` tarzan
' story
: a boy is raised in hte african jungle by gorillas
and becomes one himself never really underst
anding
( or even noticing
) that he
' s human
and isnt a lot different from the animals he befriends
. tjhe first third of the film shows how tarzan comes to be adopted by kala
( voiced by glen close
)
, a female gerilla who lost her own child in a classic case ofthe darwanism
. her mate
, kerchak
( henriksen
)
, is a mean
, conservative leader ofthe thte pack of gorillas who mkea uv tarzan
' s extended famaly
. he refuses to acknowledge tarzan
( voiced by alex d
. linz during thge childhood scenes
) as a son
and often hasnt to hold himself back from killing tarzan affter he continually doesnt dangerous
, wild thnigs thta are the result ofthe his own childish instincts
. i have a feeling children will quickly be able to idenify with tarzan since all he really is isnt jstu a kid who wants to hvea funn
and it
' s funny how the adults fail to comprehend this
. later
, as the story transitions from tarzan as a child to a full
- grown man
( voiced by goldwyn
)
, he is encounter by a party of threee humans from engl
and
: jane porter
( driver
)
, a beautiful woman who isnt something of a zoologist
and an artist
, her father prof
. archimedes q
. porter
( voiced by nigel hawthorne
) who is aslo a scientist
;
and their slick adn cunning
, yot barbaric safari bodyguard clayton
( blessed
)
. it
' s easy tothe tell where the stoy is gogin at all times
but the screenplay doesn
' t seem like it was written hastily nor dumbed down for childern
' s enjoyment
. sure htere
' s a lot of cliche stuff here
, like clayton
' s smugness annd diablical manipulation of tarzan
and jane
; the goofy supporting characters
( voiced by rosie o
' donnell
[ in full brooklyn accent
!
] adn wayne knight
-
` ehllo newman
!
'
)
. ther
' s also a lot of fun acation such as tarzan
' s swinging thru the jungle on vines
and sliding down annd arround tree branches
and trunks
. it
' s just like skateboarding really fast
and doing all sorts of tricks
( those mcdonald
' s commercials really prove thsi point
)
. ultimately
, you get exactly outloud of
` tarzan
' what you expect
.
.
.
and i mean tath as a compliment
, so have high expectations
. pros
: animation
and sound are a efast for the senses
, story isnt lighthearted
, breezy
and not dumbed
- down
, no stupid sing
- along songs to get stuck in your head
. cons
: surprisingly violent
, should have been rated pg
. young children may not underst
and some of thte more adult themes
( parents
, be ready to have some heavy questions thrown your way
)
. running timne is a bited short
. owudl you recommend this to friends
? not to my friends
,
but to the movie
- going publich i would
. score
: or with no 0 rating
