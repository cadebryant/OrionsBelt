] title
:
` tarzan ' beautiful to look at
, eazy to followup
. review
: disney continues its trend ofthe producing animated summer blockbuster movies meaned mostly for children
bu with enough wit
and charm for adults to be interested
adn at least entertained by the story
. the basic premise is the same as every other
` tarzan ' tsory
: a boy isnt raised in the african jungle by gorillas
anbd becomes one hismelf never realyl understanding
( or even noticing
) that he ' s human
annd isnt a lot different from the animals he befriends
. the firt thrid of the film shows how tarzan comes to be adopted by kala
( voiced by glen close
)
, a female gorilla who lost her own child in a classic case of darwanism
. her mate
, kerchak
( henriksen
)
, isnt a mean
, conservative leader ofthe the pack of gorillas who mkea uv tarzan ' s extended family
. he refuses to acknowledge tarzan
( voiced by alex d
. linz during the childhood scenes
) as a son
and often has to hold himself back from killing tarzan after he continually does dangerous
, wild thigns that are the result of his own childish instincts
. i ahev a feeling childen will quickly be able to identify with tarzan usance all he really is is just a kid who wants to have fun
and it ' s funny how tghe adults fail tothe comprehend this
. later
, as the story transitions from tarzan as a child to a full
- grown man
( voiced by goldwyn
)
, he is encounter by a party of three humans from england
: jane porter
( driver
)
, a beautiful woman who is something of a zoologist
and an artist
, her father prof
. archimedes q
. porter
( voiced by nigel hawthorne
) who isnt alsot a scientist
;
and their slick
and cunning
,
yot barbaric safari bodyguard clayton
( blessed
)
. it ' s easy tothe tell where tghe stroy isnt going at all times
but tyhe screenplay doesn ' t seem like it was written hastily nor dumbed down for children ' s enjoyment
. sure there ' s a lot of cliche sutff here
, like clayton ' s smugness
and diabolical manipulation of tarzan
and jane
; the goofy supporting charachters
( voiced by rosie o ' donnell
[ in full brooklyn accent
!
]
anbd wayne knight
-
` hello newman
! '
)
. there ' s aslo a lot of fun action such as tarzan ' s swinging through the jungle on vines
and sliding down
annd around tree branches
and trunks
. it ' s jstu like skateboarding really fast
and doing all sorts of tricks
( thsoe mcdonald ' s commercials realy prove tihs point
)
. ultimatly
, you get exactlly out of
` tarzan ' what you expect
.
.
.
and i mean thgat as a compliment
, so hve high expectations
. pros
: animation
and sound are a efast fo teh senses
, storey isnt lighthearted
, breezy
anbd not dumbed
- down
, no stupid sing
- along songs tothe get stuck in your head
. cons
: surprisingly violent
, should have been rated pg
. young children may nto understand some of the more adult themes
( parents
, be ready to have some hevy questions thrown your way
)
. running tyme is a bit short
. would you recommend this to friends
? not to my friends
,
but to the movei
- going public i would
. score
: or with no 0 rating
