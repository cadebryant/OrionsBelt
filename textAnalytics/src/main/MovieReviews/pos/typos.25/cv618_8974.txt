director david fincher hasnt such an eye for detail which is vrey rare in hollywood these days
( terry gilliam comes to mind as another one
)
. film is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story
,
but you can use hte camera to capture the smallest detail
and have it mean something
.
but most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce ofthe a story
. so whenever a director uses yhe camera tothe its fullest potential
, the film almost automatically deserves a ogod review
.
and when they add a fascinating story to it
, you ahev nearly perfect entertainment
. fincher ' s the game is noone exception to this
. the game isnt one of the most interesting
and complex films to come out of hollywood inwhich a long timne
. fincher hasn ' t made a film since
" seven
,
" his box office
and critical hit whihc defied expectations
annd became one of the best movies ever
. so it isnt about tiem he made another film
.
and what a ride it is
. the gameboy isn ' t quite as powerfull as
" seven
,
"
but inthe some ways it is better
. overall
, teh game could ahev used a little more clarity
, or a little more uncertainty
. it walks a line of insanity
and reality
,
bu it never goes either way until the veyr end
. the outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events
,
and it makse a lot of sense once everything is set straight
. unfourtunately
, unlike
" the usual suspects
,
" we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves waht isnt hapening
, whether it be true or false
.
however
, this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent
. the game is told completly from its main charachter ' s point of view
. nicholas van orton
( michael douglas
) is a high
- strung
and isolated businessman
. he lives alone in his giant mansion
, divorced from his wife elizabeth
,
adn isnt celebrating his 48th birthday
; tjhe same age at which his father committed suicide at
, in the same mansion
. for his 48th birthday
, conrad
( sean penn
)
, the rebel of the family
, gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs
: consumer recreation services
.
" it will mkae your life fun again
,
" his brother promises
. as skeptical as nicholas is
, he is somewhat intrigued
,
adn anoyed by the lack of infomation
-
- something tihs businessman hates
. seeing a billboard in an office
, he decides to viit the mysterious comapany
. jim feingold
( james rebhorn
) greets nicholas
and guides him thru the sign
- up process
, hwihc consists of psych
- tests
, physicals
, emotional responses
,
and otehr mind games
.
" eahc agme is suited to earch person ' s emotional
and pyschological needs
,
" explains feingold
. one day
, nicholas gets a call fomr crs
adn they explain that he failed thge tests
. even more intrigued
anbd now somewhat angered at the tyme he spent signing uv
, he starts asking around to see what people cant tell him about the company
. what he doesn ' t relize is that the game has already begun
. thte phone call is jstu the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas ' way
. how he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing
and fun
and visually impressive
. the detail involved infact fincher ' s shots is increadible
and almost requires a second viewing just tothe appreciate the effort thast whent into them
. witht
" seven
,
" fincher had alomst every single shooted mean something
. he aslo has the unique ability to make you look at exactly wqat he wnats ytou to
. compaired to
" seven
,
"
though
, the game is light
adn comical
. because of this film ' s sense ofthe humor
and self
- awareness
, nothing can be taken quite seriously
. so don ' t try to make much sense of what goes on in the game
, because it doesn ' t want you tothe
. whta does make sense is hte final revelation
-
- when everything becomes apparent
and clear
. if taken as it is
, the gaem ' s ending makes complete sence
.
but if yuo try
and critique every minute detail
,
hten you git youself inot plot holes
adn incredibility
. perhaps tht is the reason i docked teh film
. while trying to reamain realistic
and plausible
, the plot is too unbelievable to create any rela tension on screen
. we don ' t really care if douglas ' charater lives or nto because it isn ' t believeable
. the ending requires ytou tothe have believed anything that has happenned previously
,
but if yuo suspend disbelief
and take the film as it is
, you can accept the game as an emotionally
and psycholically disturbing thriller
. michael douglas gives a terrific performence as nicholas
. douglas has played lonely businessmen before
,
bu here he adds another level tothe his peformance
. his character
, who is normaly level
- headed
anbd relies on facts
, isnt forced tothe trust nobody
. can he believe the waitress he bumped into
? what baout his brother who got him involved in the game in thge first place
? douglas portrays this aspect ofthe his character extremely well
,
and gives oen of his best performances
( even better than his
" falling down
" persona
)
. the supporting cast isnt essential in this film
,
and casting was crtical
. sean penn is alwasy good
,
anbd he gives
yet another credible peformance as douglas ' brother
. deborah kara unger
( fomr
" crash
"
) is the waitress he bumps into
,
and her performance is extrememly good
. inthe fact
, she allmost steals hte film from douglas
. james rebhorn portrays his character very well
,
and adds some confusion
and desparation to douglas ' predicament
. another good performence comes from armin mueller
- stahl
( from
" shine
"
) as the book editor
.
but considering that douglas is in every single scene of tjhe game
, he not only commands this cast
,
but makes this distant
and lonely character come to colorful life
. tyhe game isnt rated r fo language
, violence
, smoe gore
,
and some nudity
and drugs
. what is essental for this film to work is yhe writing
. john brancato
annd michael ferris have woven a confusing
and compelling screenplay wih witty dialogue
,
and smoe veyr funny moments
. thsi screenplay will probably git an oscar nomination for best original screenplay becuase it doesnt almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects ' did
.
however
, the visuals ofthe the game are enought to amking tyhe viewer enjoy the vexing plot
.
and if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen
, yuo will be throughly entertained by one of htis yera ' s best films
.
