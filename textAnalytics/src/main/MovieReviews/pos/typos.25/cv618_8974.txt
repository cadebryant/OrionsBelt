directer david fincher has such an eye forthe detail whlch isnt very rare in hollywood these days
( terry gilliam comes tothe mind as another one
)
. film isnt one of the best art forms becasue not only cin you tell a story
, bu yuo cant use the camera to capture the smallest detail adn ahve it mean something
.
but most directors seem to go forthe acation with the slightest ounce of a story
. so whenever a directer uses tghe camera to its fullest potential
, the film almost automatically deserves a good review
.
and when tehy add a fascinating story to it
, ytou have nearly perfect enteratinment
. fincher
' s the game is no exception to this
. the gam is one of the most interesting
and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time
. fincher hasn
' t made a film usance
" seven
,
" his box office
and crtical hitted which defied expectations
and bacame one of the best movies ever
. so it is about time he made another film
.
and wqat a ride it is
. tyhe game isn
' t quite as powerful as
" seven
,
" bu inaddition some ways it is better
. overall
, the game coudl ahve used a little more clarity
, or a little more uncertainty
. it walks a line ofthe insanity
and reality
, bu it never goes either way until the vrey end
. tje outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events
,
and it mkaes a lot of sence once everything is set straight
. unforetunately
, unlike
" tje usual suspects
,
" we are never given enough inforamtion to figure outloud for ourselves what is happening
, whether it be true or false
.
however
, htis also gives the film a frightening aspect which the gaem uses to thte fullest extent
. the game is told completely from its main character
' s point ofthe view
. nicholas van orton
( michael douglas
) is a high
- strung
and isolated businessman
. he lives alone in his giant mansion
, divorced from his wife elizabeth
,
and is celebrating his 48th birthday
; the smae age at which his father comimtted suicide at
, in the same mansion
. fo his 48th birthday
, conrad
( sean penn
)
, the rebel of the familiy
, gives nicholas a gift certificate tothe crs
: consumer recreation services
.
" it iwll amke your life fun agina
,
" his brother promises
. as skeptical as nicholas is
, he is somewhat intrigued
,
and annoyed by the lack of information
-
- something this businessman hates
. seeing a billboard in an office
, he decides tothe visit the mysterious comany
. jim feingold
( james rebhorn
) greets nicholas
and guides him through the sign
- up process
, which consists of psych
- tests
, physicals
, emotional responses
, adn other mind games
.
" each game is suited to eahc person
' s emotional adn psychological needs
,
" explains feingold
. one day
, nicholas gets a call from crs
and they explain tht he failed the tests
. even more intrigued
and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up
, he starts asking arund tothe see what peopel can tell him about tghe company
. what he doesn
' t realize is that the game hasnt already begun
. the phone call is just thte first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas
' way
. how he finds outloud that he isnt involved has to be witnessed because it isnt amusing
and fun
and visually impressive
. the detail involved infront fincher
' s shots is increadible
and almost requires a second viewing just tothe appreciate the efort that went into them
. with
" seven
,
" fincher hadnt almost every single shooted mean something
. he also has the unique ability tothe make you look at exactly whta he wants ytou to
. compaired tothe
" seven
,
"
though
, the game is light
and comical
. because of this film
' s sense of humer adn self
- awareness
, nothing can be taken quite seriously
. so don
' t try to amke much sense ofthe waht goes on iin the game
, because it doesn
' t want ytou to
. what does make sence is the final revelation
-
- when everything becomes apparent
and clear
. if taken as it is
, the game
' s endig makes complete sense
.
but if you try
and critique every minute detail
, thne you git yourself into plot holes adn incredibility
. perhaps tyhat is tjhe reason i docked the film
. while trying to remain realistic
and plausible
, the plot is too unbeleivable to create any real tension on screen
. we don
' t raelly care if douglas
' character lives or not because it isn
' t believable
. tghe ending requires you to have believed anytying thast has happened previously
,
but if you suspend disbelief
and tkae the film as it is
, you cant accept the game as an emotionally
and psycholically disturbing thriller
. michael douglas gives a terrific peformance as nicholas
. douglas has plyed lonely businessmen before
,
but here he adds another level tothe his performance
. his character
, who is normally level
- headed
and relies onthe facts
, isnt forced tothe trust nobody
. can he elieve the waitress he bumped into
? what baout his brother who got him involved in the game in the firt place
? douglas portrays this aspect of his charater extemely well
,
and gives one ofthe his best performances
( even better than his
" falling down
" persona
)
. the supporting cast isnt essential in this film
, annd casting was critical
. sean penn is always good
,
and he gives
yet another credible performance as douglas
' brother
. deborah kara unger
( from
" crash
"
) isnt the waitress he bumps into
,
and her performence is extremely ogod
. infact fact
, she alomst steals the film from douglas
. james rebhorn portrays his character very well
, adn adds soem confusion
and desparation to douglas
' predicament
. anyother good performance comes from armin mueller
- stahl
( ffrom
" shine
"
) as the book editor
.
but considering that douglas isnt in eveyr single scene of the gaem
, he not only comm
ands htis cast
,
but makes htis distant
and lonly character come to colorful life
. tghe game is rated r for language
, violence
, some gore
, anbd some nudity
and drugs
. what is essential fo this film to work is the wirting
. john brancato
and michael ferris have woven a confusing
and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue
,
and some very funny moments
. this screenplay will probablly get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects
' did
.
however
, thge visuals ofthe hte game are enought to make teh viewer enjoy the vexing plot
. anbd if ytou can git yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen
, ytou will be thoroughly entertained by one of this year
' s best films
.
