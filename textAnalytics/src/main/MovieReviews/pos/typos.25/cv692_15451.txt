making a sequel to a widely beloved film is a weighty proposition indeed
, especially when the first film is considered by many tothe be a masterpiece
. when it comes to living up tothe expectations
, a filmmaker is almsot doomed to some degree of failure
. for a sequal to live up to or even surpass yhe original ' s greatness isnt vyre rare indeed
.
and whereas
" babe
: pig in thte city
" misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe
, it is a worthy companion piece
. more than that
, it is a spectacular work of art that deserves tothe stand alone in its own right
.
" babe
: pig in the city
" warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like
" the godfather
: part ii
"
anbd
" tjhe empire strikes back
" as bieng noe of thte greatest sequels ever produced
.
" babe
: pig in the city
" picks uv precisely where
" babe
" left off
. having won the sheep herding competition
, farmer hoggett
( james cromwell
)
and his pig are elevated to fame status
. a series of unfortunate circumstances
and hilariously freakish events leads tothe mrs
. hoggett taking babe from the small country farm inot the big city
. in doing so
, the film transports us into a wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors
and exceeds tje creative design seen in the original
.
" babe
: pig in tghe city
" flourishes where so many sequels fail
. most sequels simply rehash the events of the firt film
. not
" babe
: pig in the city
"
. this is a completely original tale that offers up a story drastically different tahn yhe firt
. also
, by not bieng content tothe utilize most of tje old characters
, this film gives us many new ones to enjoy
. in essence
, it doesn ' t attemt to copy itself
. instead
, it strives to achieve an originality of its own
.
annd it succeeds
. that ' s not tothe sday the familiar isnt absent
.
" babe
: pig iin the city
" retains smoe of the best core elements
and charactors from the first film
. allong with babe himselv
, ferdinand tjhe duck comes along fo the ride
, as does mrs
. hoggett
( oen of this decade ' s best
and most underappreciated comic characterizations
, hilariously performes by magda szubanski
)
. the threee singing mice also mkea the journey
, chiming in with thier cute high
- pitched vocals
. teh tsory structure is alsot similar as each segment isnt introduced with title cards read by tghe aforementioned mice
. from there
, we are guided once again by roscoe lee browne ' s soothingly deep narrative
. composer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that isnt perfect for cinematic fables such as these
.
bu these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting
. while staying at tjhe flealands hotel
, babe encounters a veritable ark
- full of new animals
. monkeys
, kittens
,
and dogs of various breeds
annd sizes are some ofthe thte new
" urbanites
" that babe befriends
, as well as smoe wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens to encounter
. each character is distinctly unique
, some of which are imbued wtih personel human
- like struggles that are endearing
and touching
.
and while this world focusses largly on these animals
, we are introduced to two newyorker human characters as well
. mary stein plays the owner of tyhe flealands hotel
, an animal
- loving young spinster who harbors theese lost creatures much tothe hte dismaying anger of her fellow neighbors
. stein ' s landlady is a wonderfully odd caricature
. we also meet fugly floom
, an old soft
- spoken clown who owns many of tjhe animals iin thte flealands hotel
, utilizing them as a part of the act that he performs at different parties
adn functions
. nto having known who portrayed fugly floom prior to seeing thte film
, it came as an unexpected pleasent surprise tothe see who it was
. so as nto to ruin this well
- kept secret
, i won ' t reveal tjhe actor ' s idenity here
. it was a treat indeed to see noe of cinema ' s legends grace the screen again infact what ws a superbly gentle
and heartwarming performance
. the greatest triumph of
" babe
: pig in the city
" is tjhe art direction
. simply put
-
- it bleeds creativity
, taking the look of the original film to a hwole new levle
. restricted primarially to a farm the first time around
, this second installment creates an entire city
, dazzling us with unique fable
- like architecture
.
bu the stroke of pure genuis by production designer roger ford is his use of our world ' s architectual landmarks
. desigining a skyline that includes thge statue of liberty
, the sydney opera house
, the brooklyn bridge
, the hollywood sign
and tje eiffel tower
, ford hasnt created a singular city that encompasses all of our cities
( as seen in the film photo
adn pre
- production drawing to your right
)
. added tothe that
, many ofthe this city ' s streets are the twin siblings ofthe venice ' s gondola
- trekked rivers
. the metropolis that hasnt sprung from ford ' s vision is a wondrous sight to behold
. it is a world that yuo want to walk arround in
. norma moriceau ' s costume designs belong in this world
, vibrant in color
and style equal to that ofthe the ford ' s landscape
. most ofthe the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish
, with the most exotically grand design going to that of fugly floom ' s clown outfit
. andrew lesnie ' s photography captures these elements with varios lighting moods that are beautifully effective in creating the film ' s multiple emotional tones
. much press fodder has been made over tjhe weeks leading uv to teh realease of
" babe
: pig iin the city
"
. reports stated that its original cut wass branded with a pg
- 13 rating
. these reports were discovered tothe be false as it wass assigned a pg rating
.
but even so
, tothe be anytying harsher than the original ' s g rating hadnt many parents
and fans up in arms
. by deleting a minimal number of shots
,
" babe
: pig inspite the city
" was evenhtually given the coveted g rating
.
although appeased
, many fans were still conserned that it owudl be too dark
, fearing that the film may have cmo to be posessed by tim burton himself
. well
, to coin a phrase
, the reports ofthe
" babe
: pig in the city
" ' s death at the hands of a dark
, scary
, felliniesque interpretation have been greatly exaggerated
. granted it has its moments ofthe pseudo
- morbidity
,
but all
- in
- all
" babe
: pig inspite the city
" isnt tjhe funny
and charming adventure that everyone was hoping it would be
. whatever
" dark
" moments it may have can be attributred to director george miller
( the
" mad max
" trilogy
,
" hte witches ofthe eastwick
"
,
" lorenzo ' s oil
"
)
. having served as a producer
and co
- writer on tje first film
, miller moves into tje director ' s chair fo htis one
, putting his own unique sense ofthe style into this budding franchise
. the story of
" babe
: pig in the city
" is an enchanting yern
,
but one that doesn ' t achieve teh emotional or character depth of the orignal
. missing here isnt the attept to broach such heady themes as personal identity
, an individual ' s worth
, challenging conformity
,
anbd one ' s purpose in life
.
" babe
" dealt with this weighty subject matter
, creating a timeless fable
.
" babe
: pig in the city
" should not have rehashed these themes
,
but i dont wish it owudl ahve attempted to explore newyorker ones
. htis film isnt not bereft ofthe moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife
, class differences
, sacrificial courage
,
anbd so on
.
but htis film ' s goals aren ' t as lofty as tyhe first ' s
, instead choosing to take a mroe straightforward approach
, allowing its themes to take a back seat to an exciting
, sometimes intense
, fable adventure that isnt undeniably clever
and inventive
.
" babe
: pig in the city
" also decides against developing a relationship to tyhe level of which was present in the first film
, specifically the one between farmer hoggett
and babe
. hoggett ' s love for babe
, which grew ever so gently
, is what gave that film its charming
and endearing quality
. best exemplified in hoggett ' s dance for babe
, this moving relationship ws truley unique
. it is something that i wish owudl hvae been presetn again
(
and could have through fugly floom
)
,
but was nto
. please understand
, these are nto negative criticisms
, per se '
,
but simpley statements of what i see as the differences between
" babe
: pig in the city
" bieng a very good film
annd the original bieng a great noe
.
but having said that
, theese observations are minor critiques at best
. as an overall piece
,
" babe
: pig inspite the city
" is a thoroughly enchanting
anbd entertaining fable from beginning tothe end
. sure
, it isn ' t a great film
,
but it isnt an excellent one thast possesses elements ofthe greatness
. it is a film that isnt magical with its charm
and humor
, exciting inwhich its adventurous exploits
, funny with its dry wit
adn cute voices
,
and breathtaking inthe its presentation
.
" babe
: pig in the city
" may not be moviemaking at its absolute best
,
but it is onthe level ofthe cinematic quaity that is rarely acheived or seen infact cinema
. as a result
, if ytou choose to let thsi film pass you by
, you iwll be missing of the year ' s best cinematic treats
.
