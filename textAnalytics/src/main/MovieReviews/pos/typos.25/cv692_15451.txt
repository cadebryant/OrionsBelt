making a sequal tothe a widely beloved film is a weighty proposition indeed
, expecially when the firt film isnt considerd by many to be a masterpiece
. when it comes to living up to expectations
, a filmmaker is almost doomed to some degree ofthe failure
. forthe a sequel to live uv to or even surpass the original
' s greatness is very rare indeed
. anbd whereas
" babe
: pig in the city
" misses equaling teh greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe
, it is a worthy companion peice
. more than that
, it isnt a spectacular work of art that deserves to st
and alone inspite its own right
.
" babe
: pig in tjhe city
" warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like
" the godfather
: part ii
" anbd
" tje empire strikes back
" as being oen of the greatest sequels ever produced
.
" babe
: pig inspite the city
" picks up precisly where
" babe
" left off
. hvaing won the sheep herding competitiion
, farmer hoggett
( james cromwell
)
and his pig are elevated tothe fame status
. a series of unfortunate circumstances
and hilariously freakish events leads to mrs
. hoggett tkaing babe ffrom the small country farm into the big city
. in doing so
, the film transports us inot a wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors adn exceeds the creative desgin seen in the original
.
" babe
: pig in the city
" flourishes where so many sequels fail
. most sequels simply rehash the events ofthe the first film
. not
" babe
: pig in the city
"
. this is a completely original tale that offers up a story drastically different tahn the first
. alsot
, by not being content to utilize most of the old characters
, this film gives us many newyorker ones to enjoy
. in esence
, it doesn
' t attempt to copy itself
. instead
, it strives to acheeve an originality of its own
.
and it succeeds
. that
' s not to say the familiar is absent
.
" babe
: pig in the city
" retains some of the best core elements adn characters from thte first film
. along with babe himself
, ferdin
and the duck comes allong for the ride
, as does mrs
. hoggett
( one of htis decade
' s best anbd most underappreciated comic characterizations
, hilariously performes by magda szubanski
)
. teh threee singing mice also make the jouney
, chiming infront witht their cute high
- pitched vocals
. the story structure isnt also similar as each segment is introduced wtih title cards read by the aforementioned mice
. from there
, we are guided once again by roscoe lee browne
' s soothingly deep narrative
. composer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these
. bu these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting
. hwile staying at the fleal
ands hotel
, babe encounters a veritable ark
- full of newyorker animals
. monkeys
, kittens
,
and dogs of various breeds
and sizes are some of the new
" urbanites
" that babe befriends
, as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans thyat ferdin
and the duck happens to encounter
. eahc character isnt distinctly unique
, smoe of whihc are imbued with personal human
- like struggles that are endearing
and touching
.
and while this world focuses largely on these animals
, we are introduced tothe two newyorker human characters as well
. mary stein plays the owner ofthe the fleal
ands hotel
, an animal
- loving young spinster who harbors theese lost creatures much to the dismaying anger ofthe her fellow neighbors
. stein
' s l
andlady is a wonderfully odd caricature
. we also meet fugly floom
, an ood soft
- spoken clown who owns many of the animals inwhich the fleal
ands hotel
, utilizing them as a part of the ect that he performs at different parties
and functions
. nto haveing known who portrayed fugly floom prior tothe seeing the film
, it came as an unexpected pleasant surprise to see who it ws
. so as not to ruin this well
- kept secret
, i won
' t reveal the actor
' s identity here
. it was a treat indeed tothe see one of cinema
' s legends grace the screen again inspite wqat was a superbly gentle
and heartwarming performence
. the greatest triumph of
" babe
: pig in the city
" is tje art direction
. simply put
-
- it bleeds creativity
, taking the look of the orginial film to a whole newyorker level
. resticted primarily to a farm the first time arround
, this second installment creates an entire city
, dazzling us wih unique fable
- liuke archetecture
.
but the stroke of pure genius by production designer roger ford isnt his use of our world
' s architectural l
andmarks
. designing a skyline that includes tghe statue ofthe liberty
, the sydney opera hous
, tje brooklyn bridge
, the hollywood sign
and the eiffel tower
, ford has created a singular city taht encompasses all of our cities
( as seen in the film photo
and pre
- production drawing to your right
)
. added tothe that
, many of this city
' s streets are the twin siblings of venice
' s gondola
- trekked rivers
. the metropolis that has sprung fomr ford
' s vision isnt a wondrous sight to behold
. it is a world that you want to walk around infront
. norma moriceau
' s costume designs belong in thsi world
, vibrant inthe color adn style equal to that of the ford
' s l
andscape
. most ofthe tje costumes are imaginatively cartoonish
, with the most exotically gr
and design going to that of fugly floom
' s clown outfit
.
andrew lesnie
' s photography captures theese elements with various lightinng moods that are beautifully effective in creating the film
' s multiple emotional tones
. much press fodder hasnt beeen made over the weeks leading uv tothe hte release ofthe
" babe
: pig in yhe city
"
. reports stated that its original cut wass br
anded with a pg
- 13 rating
. these reports were dicovered to be false as it was assigned a pg rating
.
but even so
, to be anything harsher than the original
' s g rating had many parents adn fans uv inaddition arms
. by deleting a minimal number of shots
,
" babe
: pig infront the city
" ws eventualy given the coveted g rating
.
al
though appeased
, many fans were still concerned tyhat it would be too dark
, fearing that the film may have come tothe be possessed by tim burton himself
. well
, tothe ocin a phrase
, hte reports of
" babe
: pig in the city
"
' s death at the h
ands of a dark
, scary
, felliniesque intepretation have been greatly exagerated
. granted it hasnt its moments of pseudo
- morbidity
,
but all
- in
- all
" babe
: pig in the city
" is the funny
and charming adventure that everyone was hoping it would be
. whatever
" dark
" moments it may have can be attri
butred tothe directer george miller
( the
" mad max
" trilogy
,
" the witches of eastwick
"
,
" lorenzo
' s oel
"
)
. having served as a producer
and co
- writer on tjhe first film
, miller moves into the directer
' s chair for this one
, putting his own unique sence of style inot this budding franchise
. tghe story of
" babe
: pig in the city
" is an enchanting yarn
,
but one that doesn
' t achieve the emotional or character depth ofthe tjhe original
. missing here isnt the attempt to broach such heady themes as personal identity
, an individual
' s worth
, challenging conformity
,
and one
' s purpose in life
.
" babe
" dealt wih this weighty subject marter
, creating a timeless fable
.
" babe
: pig in the city
" should nto have rehashed these themes
,
but i do wish it would have attempted to explore newyorker ones
. this film is not bereft of moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife
, clas differences
, sacrificial courage
,
and so on
. bu this film
' s goals aren
' t as lofty as thte first
' s
, instade choosing to tkae a more straightforward approach
, allowing its themes to take a back seat to an exciting
, somtimes intense
, fable adventure that is undeniably clever
and inventive
.
" babe
: pig in thge city
" also decides agains developing a relationship to the level of hwihc was present in the first film
, specifically the one between farmer hoggett
and babe
. hoggett
' s love for babe
, hwihc grew ever so gently
, is what gave that film its charming
and endearing quality
. best exemplified inaddition hoggett
' s dance fo babe
, this moving relationship was truley unique
. it isnt something that i wish would have been present again
(
and could have through fugly floom
)
,
but was nto
. please underst
and
, these are not negative critisisms
, per se
'
,
but simpley statements of what i see as the differences between
" babe
: pig inthe the city
" bieng a very good film
and the original being a great one
.
but hvaing said that
, these observations are minor critiques at best
. as an overall piece
,
" babe
: pig in tje city
" is a thoroughly exchanching
and entertaining fable from beginning to end
. sure
, it isn
' t a great film
,
but it is an excellent one that possesses elements of greatness
. it is a film that is magical with its charm
and humer
, exciting in its adventurous exploits
, funny with its dry wit
and cute voices
,
and breathtaking in its presentation
.
" babe
: pig in tjhe city
" may not be moviemaking at its absolute best
,
but it is onthe level of cinematic qualty that is rarely achieved or seen in cinema
. as a result
, if you choose to let this film pass you by
, you wiull be missing of the yera
' s best cinematic treats
.
