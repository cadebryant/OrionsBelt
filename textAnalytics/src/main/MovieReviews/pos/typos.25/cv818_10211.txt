it hasnt beeen three long years sicne quentin tarantino stunned tghe cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival
' s palme d
' or
, a
$ 100 million
- plus box office gross
,
and an oscar nomination
? all for his sophomore outing
, pulp fiction
. since
then
, hte talented film maker has been virtualy invisible
, surfacing briefly as a co
- director of the wildly uneven four rooms adn tjhe screenwriter of the gory vampire
- fest
, from dusk till dawn
. in between
, he has moonlighted as an
" ator
" withthe severeal decidely unmemorable performances
. now
, with much fanfare
and anticipation
, tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort
, jackie brown
.
and
, while this motion picture
, adapted from elmore leonard
' s novel
, rum punch
, offers solid entertainment
, those expecting anyother bravura outing ffrom tarantino will leave theaters dissappointed
. for thge most part
, jackie brown isnt a pretty ordinary crime movie
. the story
, whitch starts out slowly
, develops inot a twisty affair
, with doulbe
- crosses
and triple
- crosses
.
and the movei is littered whith occasional tarantino trademarks
: witty dialogue
, unexpected gunfire
,
' 70s pop tunes
,
and close
- ups of womens
' bare feet
.
yet
, for all of tht
, the prodcution isnt something of a letdown
. thge sheer
, infront
- your
- face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs
and especially pulp fiction is absent
. the mostly
- straightforward chronology ofthe jackie brown doesn
' t match uv favorably to the non
- linear style of tarantino
' s previvous efforts
? an approach that added tension
and edginess to the narratives
.
and htere aren
' t nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around
. there
' s a samuel l
. jackson monologue baout guns
, a jackson
/ chris tucker argument regarding thge merits of hiding in a car trunk
, anbd a jackson
/ robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson
/ travolta material from pulp fiction
, bu thyat
' s baout it
. jackie brown
' s lone
" innovation
" is its presentation ofthe a crucial sequence from three different perspectives
. this isn
' t exactly an original technique
? it has been done numerous times before
, most famously inwhich akira kurosawa
' s rashomon
and most recently iin edward zwick
' s courage under fier
. howver
, while in those two movies
(
and others
)
, there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points
- of
- view
, tarantino
' s sole purpose for using it appears tothe be because it
' s unconventional
. had the scenes infact question been shown from only oen of tyhe three vantages
, nothing would ahve been lost
. as a result
, this aspect ofthe teh film is little omre thna a curiosity
. forthe the second picture in a row
, tarantino is attempting tothe revive the career of a
' 70s icon
. this tiem around
, instead ofthe john travolta
, it
' s blaxploitation queen pam grier
( foxy brown has become jackie brown
)
. infront one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier
' s career
, tarantino uses a
' 70s song to accompany her frist apearance druing tjhe opening credits
. there are allso several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towords certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre
(
al
though grier never doens any
butt
- kicking
)
. grier isnt jackie brown
, a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs
and money into the untied states
. she
' s working for gun dealer ordell robbie
( samuel l
. jackson
)
,
but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning
, despite pressure ffrom ravy nicolet
( michael keaton
)
, a federal official
. no longer sure whether or nto he can trust jackie
, ordell arranges for a bail bondsman
, max cherry
( robert forster
, tv
' s
" banyon
"
) to post the necesary
$ 10
, 000
,
then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal
. jackie passes ordell
' s test
,
however
, anbd soon the twpo ofthe them are plotting a way to smuggle
$ 500
, 000 of ordell
' s money into the united states without tipping off the feds
. soon
, just about everyone is after that monay
, including jackie
, max
, ray
, ordell
' s perpetually oversexed adn drugged
- out girlfriend
, melanie
( bridget fonda
)
,
and his right
- h
and man
, louis
( robert de niro
)
. unsurprisingly
, tjhe most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l
. jackson
,
but ordell isn
' t nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction
. infact addition to looking fantastic
, pam grier is also quite good
,
al
though hers is not an oscar
- caliber performance
( altho she might git a nomination
)
. robert forster
and michael keaton are solid infront their tough
- guys
- who
- rarely
- smile roles
. bridget fonda is aroud for threee discernible reasons
: tothe look sexy in a bikini
, to provide a little twisted comedy
,
and to satisfy tarantino
' s foot fetish
. robert de niro is criminally underused in a part that sould haev been played equally well by any grungy
- looking
, middle
- aged actro
. the film
, which clocks in at several minutes over tje two
-
and
- a
- half hour mark
, is probably too long for the material
, bu the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout
(
al
though tyhe payoff is a letdown
)
. tarantino keesh things moving along nicely
, with a heavier dose of humer
and less violence than inwhich pulp fiction
,
but
, on teh whole
, this movei seems more like the work of one ofthe his wannabes than something ffrom the directer hismelf
. when it comes to reccent caper films
( like yhe grifters
and bound
)
, jackie brown isnt a second
- tier efford
. it
' s an intertaining diversion
, bu nto a masterpiece
,
and certainly not an oscar contender
.
