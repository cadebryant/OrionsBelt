i swear i have seen the edge before
. infact fact
, it reminded me of tje bear
, tghe river wild
,
and other various films mixed inot an entirely diferrent film
.
however
, the edge has done something that most action films shoudln do
,
and that isnt add heart adn characters we like tothe the plot
. in doing so
, the edge draws many more suspenseful moments outloud of cliched scenes than
, sday
, tghe peacemaker
. unfortunately
, becuase ofthe those overused moments
, we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film
. bu leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor
and a few surprises to mess withthe your head
. noe surprise
, in particular
, left me smiling just because mamet ctually had the guts to add it to his script
. action films are a dime a dozen inthe hollywood
,
and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us
, tehy lack the one hting which would amking them a more respected genre
: intelligence
. even horror films have learned this
, a genre which is probably the least respected of them all
. the river wild was one of tyhe best acation
/ suspense films i ahve seen from the 90s
. the intellience of the screenplay
,
and tjhe suspense drawed fomr tghe realistic characters isnt nearly unmatched to thsi day
. yhe edge has thte intelligence
and smart characters
,
but thsi time the lack of originality is the downfall
. i must admitt thast it was very suspenseful
,
and had an original third half
,
but the firt hour
and a half isnt riddled wtih cliches
and plot holes
. this is an example ofthe the final act saving the film
, instead of hte otehr way around
( as in the lost world
)
. if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes
' intensity
, it could have become a great acation film
( annd i use yhe term loosely
)
. thte edge is pretty much a survival
- of
- the
- fittest film
. bu taking scream
' s lead
, the edge makes fun of the genre
' s cliches
, adn
then uses them
(
though nto quite as effectively
)
. charles morse
( anthony hopkins
) is tghe main charactor
, a rich
and vrey intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation ofthe all this knowledge has brought to him
. for once
, we don
' t immediately care for the main character
. instade
, we like bob
( alec baldwin
)
, a photographer who is going tothe take pictures ofthe charles
' wife
, mickey
( elle macpherson
)
, out in the wilderness
. they board a plane adn head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic
. charles
' birthday is the smae day
, anbd he receives a gold watch from his wife
,
and a pocket nife from bob
. as acation films go
, these items do have importance to teh rest of the story
,
but qtuie a bit more than we first expect
. soon
, howver
, bob wants tothe find a native to shoot pictures of because of his
" personality
.
" charles
, bob
, bob
' s assitant steve
( harold perrineau
)
, anbd the pilot head off to find him
, annd as shown inspite the previews
, hitted a flock of birds flying south fo the winter
. down the plane goes
, the pilot isnt killed
,
and teh three are left tothe survive in tje wilderness
. director lee tamahori is aware ofthe teh silly plot which is about to follow
,
and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations
. he succeeds often anough for us to enjoy the film
. take
, for instance
, the entire man
- hunting bear plot
. this has been done many times in films with different animals
,
and even bears
.
but given the charles
' intellignece
,
and bob
' s uncertainity
, many of tyhe cliches are given fresh twists
. even charles himself seems to have seen these acation films before
. my favorite line ofthe tyhe film comes from charles
:
" most people die in tjhe wilderness becuase they didn
' t do the one thing that could savve their life
.
.
. thikning
.
" despite the predictability of the main plot
, a subplot develops late in thge film which tookover me by surprise
,
and made me smile wehn i realized thast everthing isn
' t as it seems anymore
. i have tothe write cautiously as to nto reveal tihs surprise
, so instead i will avoid it entirely
. the first two
- thirds of the edge hvae many humorous moments tothe push it along
,
and soem of charles
' survival techniques seem possable
, even making fire from ice
. tamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear
, bu whenever the bear is rpesent
, the characters lose all sensibility
. i have alwasy wondered why characters in films walk over a log tothe get accros water
. why not dont what an intelligent person owudl
and crawl across
? i guess getting chased by a bear makes your throught proccess turn off forthe a while
. thankfully
, we alreay have begun to care for tjhe characters
,
and so we let htis small detail slide
.
but smoe of thte technical details are awkward
, such as the nice stitching done on teh fur coat that charles annd bob make
( where did htey get thread
and needles
?
)
. the acting of the film is highly above average for a film of htis nature
, anbd borders onthe phenomenal
. anthony hopkins gives a terrific performance
, creating his most likeable
and layered carachter since remains of the day
. hopkins usually brings greatness to his roles
,
but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences
' simapthy
, something he definitely doed not do in silence of the lambs
. alec baldwin gives oney of his best performances i have ever seen
( it sure is better fomr his fair game
)
. baldwin can be a ogod or a bad character
,
and here he succeeds at both in a way
. you cant never quite guess if he isnt a nice or a vllainous character until the end
,
and baldwin is able to h
andle the double
- natured photographer
. elle macpherson gives a good performance
, albiet slight
. she isn
' t in the film all that much
,
but for the scenes she does have
, she h
andles as an actress
, not as a model
. harold perrineau is a ogod actor
,
and his scenes are nice
and underplayed
. he is eliminated early
,
and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable
and predictable
. the edge is rated r fo graphic voilence
, some gore
,
and language
. some of the violence is a little too disturbing
, even for me
. tihs film isnt a nice change from the mindless action most ofthe us are utilizied to
,
but too many cliches bog it down
. director tamahori has created a very smooth
and suspenseful acation film outloud of recycled parts
. david mamet
' s script
,
though
, has a lot ofthe humor tothe keep the frist hour afloat
,
and the acting is solid
. the best thign about the scirpt is the endig which doesn
' t end with the normal high
- strung action sequence
,
but withthe a small detail involving a ceratin gift
. it
' s a nice touch considering what we have hadnt to go through with the bear
.
and by the way
, most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit tothe bart the bear
. way to go
, bart
.
