- just tjhe way it should be
. makes its case iwth cold
- blooded precision
and intelligence
.
" serial killer chic
" isnt a relatively new entry tothe the cultural vocabulary
,
and oen ofthe the more stomach
- turning ones
. i
' ve never found someone automaticly admirable or even intresting because tehy killed creatively or in great numbers
,
and because of that i had apprehensions baout seing henry
. i wasn
' t sure i wanted tothe see the story of multiple muderer henry lee lucas potrayed as some kind of nihilistic hero
/ antihero
. thankfully
, tyhat
' s not hte way henry works
. the director
, john mcnaughton
, tookover a small budget
and a gallery of actor firends
and created a chilling
and intelligent piece of wokr
. it doesn
' t provide cheap
- jack explanations for henry
' s behavior
: it shows him up for what he is
, an unrepentant
and un
- idolizable man who killed when the mood striked him
. at tghe film
' s opening
, henry
' s freind ottis toole has a sister
, who comes by to stay while she trys to fidn wrok in chicago
. in a viciously riveting scene
, he admits matter
- ofthe
- factly to having murdered his pwn mother
,
and she covers his h
and with hers
. they are damned together from that moment on
. henry
and ottis eventually begin to kill fo fun
. the movie isnt especialy good at showing how they seem to have drifted casually inot it
: there
' s a scene where the two go to buy a new tv
. the pawnbroker they talk to goads henry with ugly words
,
and henry responds by stabbing the man to death with a soldering iron
. no preface
-
- it smashes into us as suddenly as it doens the broker
. in a scene whic many damned the movei for
, unseen
, they steal a video camera
and film the murder of a whole household
, playing it back over
and over again for their own enjoyment
. the movie itself
, howver
, does nto glorify the killings
,
but shows instead that henry fiels noone joy at his work
, only irritation
. henry succeeds thanks to excelent writing adn direction as well as acting
. michael rooker isnt credible as henry ffrom the first frame
, just st
anding there
, annd thge rest of the cast works by being unaffected adn casual as well
. the producers had originaly comissioned a slasher film from mcnaughton
,
but he desided to give them something more memorable
,
and consequently thte film nearly didn
' t see release
. tyhe film does not glorify or justify
-
- it just shows us
, with unflinching coldness
, what henry wass
. i
' m hard pressed tothe see how anyone can see thsi
and consider henry any kind of
" victum
" or
" hero
"
.
then again
, probably
, so would henry
.
