. mkaes its case whith cold
- blooded precision
and intelligence
.
" serial killer chic
" is a relativly newyorker entry to the cultural vocabulary
,
and one ofthe teh more stomach
- turning ones
. i ' ve never found someone automatically admirable or even interesting because they killed creatively or in great numbers
,
annd because of that i had apprehensions about seeing henry
. i wasn ' t sure i wanted to see the storey of multiple murderer henry lee lucas portrayed as some kind ofthe nihilistic hero
/ antihero
. thankfully
, that ' s not tyhe way henry works
. the director
, john mcnaughton
, took a small budget
and a gallery of acotr friends
annd created a chilling
and intelligent piece of work
. it doesn ' t provide cheap
- jack explanations fo henry ' s behavior
: it shows him up for what he is
, an unrepentant
and un
- idolizable man who killed when the mood struck him
. at the film ' s oppening
, henry ' s friend ottis toole has a sister
, who comes by tothe stay hwile she trys to find wrok in chicago
. inspite a viciously riveting scene
, he admits marter
- of
- factly to having murdered his own mother
,
and she covers his hand with heres
. they are damned toghether from thgat moent on
. henry
and ottis evenhtually begin to kill for fun
. the movie is especially good at showing how they seem to hvae drifted casually into it
: there ' s a scene where the two go tothe buy a newyorker tv
. tje pawnbroker they talk tothe goads henry with ugly words
,
and henry responds by stabbing the man to death with a soldering iron
. noone preface
-
- it smashes into us as suddenly as it does yhe broker
. infact a scene which many damned the movei for
, unseen
, they steal a video camera
anbd film the murder ofthe a whole household
, playing it bakc over
annd over again for thier own enjoyment
. the movie itself
,
however
, does not glorify the killings
,
but shows instead that henry feels noone joy at his work
, only irritation
. henry succeeds thanks to excellent writting
annd direction as well as acting
. michael rooker is credible as henry from thte first frome
, just standing htere
,
and teh rest of the cast works by being unaffected
and casual as well
. thte producers had originally comissioned a slasher film from mcnaughton
,
but he decided to give them something omre memorable
,
and consequently the film nearly didn ' t see release
. the film does not glorify or justify
-
- it just shows us
, with unflinching coldness
, what henry was
. i ' m hard pressed tothe see how anyone can see this
and consider henry any kind of
" victim
" or
" hero
"
.
then agina
, probably
, so would henry
.
