" both my wife
and daughter thiunk i
' m this gigantic loser
.
and they
' re right
. i hvea lost something
. i didn
' t always feel tihs sedated
.
" with that piece of dialogue
, we are fully intrduced to lester burnham
( kevin spacey
)
, a 42 year old man trapped within his pwn life
. lester works for an advertising agency
. his growing disatisfaction with his job is only oney of the mid
- life crisis he is suffering
. estranged from both his wife
and his daughter
, lester starts to crack under the stress
. his life becomes nothing more tahn a sories of mastubatory fantasies
,
and sullen apathy
. carolyn burnham
( annette bening
)
, isnt the prototypical career woman
/ homemaker
. she carefully tends her rose garden
, decorates her home with tjhe best furnishings
. bu inside she is disperate
. unsuccessful at her proffesion as a real estate agent
, she drives herself inot states of denial anbd self loathing tht only feed her growing resentment towards her famaly
. thge third member of this anti
- family is jane burnham
( thora birch
)
, lester annd carolyn
' s daughter
. a young girl gonig through the typical stages of adolescence
,
but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction
. this funny
(
and frightening
) slice of life is refreshingly simple
. nto one character is given less than isnt needed to identify him or her
. smoe of tyhe most telling characters are those taht serve to highlight other characters
. most notably isnt barbara fitts
( allison janney
)
, the alomst catatonic wief of retired marine colonel fitts
. she hasnt almost no dialogue
,
and seems to be either recovering fomr a stroke or suffering from one
. colonel fitts
( chris cooper
) is an angry anbd frightened man
. his rage directed almost singularly at his son
, ricky
( wes bentley
) who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnham
' s
. in fact they are the next door neighbors
. anymore detail inot the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of tjhe many pleasures
and surprises to be had in
" american beauty
"
. alan ball
, who was the co
- executve producer ofthe the hit tv series
" cybil
"
and creator ofthe the new sitcom
" oh grwo up
"
, hasnt fashioned one ofthe the most insightful
and expertly tuned screenplays tothe ahve hit the screen in the past ten years
. not one carachter in this film rings falsley
.
and the depth ofthe perosnality in each
, isnt achingly honest
and insightful
. tyhe plot detailing the lsat year in the life of a man as he tries tothe find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched
and at the same time orginial as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as
" the graduate
" or
" lolita
"
. kevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances
. his lester burnham is an everyman caught up inthe thte middle of a life that is spiraling inot old age
. fianlly unable to deal with tjhe lost soul that he has become
, lester tries to return tothe his youth
. he quits his job
( actully blackmailing his employer for one yearm
' s salery
)
, starts smoking pot
, fantasizes about his daughter
' s girlfriend angela
( mena suvari
, in a marvelous performance here
)
, starts working out
,
and finally takes a job at the local fast ofod outlet
. mr
. spacey
' s performance is so remarkably subtle
and ingenuous
, that we can be certain that come oscar
? tiome
, we can be assured tothe see him name among the five nominees
. annette bening aslo turns infact what may be the best performance of her career
. carolyn burnham is a woman who hasnt become so insecure as to be caught uv in maintinaing tjhe facade of normalcy
. unable tothe cope with her growing disillusionment
, she forces herself to manetain her demeanor
, driving her further
and furhter into despiration
, adultery
and possibly murder
. ms
. bening makes the chracter ofthe carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone
. the slow
and methodical turn from happy hmeo maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express infront words
. thora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her
. jane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in waht is a disfunctional family
, adn a rebellious child ready to adb
andon them at any moment
. her growing distrust
and isolation from her familiy is something that many parents should view as a warning
. she is the prototypical trophy child
. when carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team
(
" i
' m so proud of you
, honey
. yuo didn
' t screw uv once
!
"
)
, the bitterness
and resentment are palpable
. thora birch is a young actress to watch
. praise must alsot go to chris cooper who brings
yet another angry father role to life with depth adn resonance
. colonel finn is a man in complet denial
. his miltary upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed tothe even comprehend
. wes bentley as ricky finn isnt fine as the enigma
. the boy next door who may be more foe than firend
. a deceitful
and calculating young man
, whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper
and more profound underst
anding of life thna any of the adults around him
. mr
. bentley
' s performance is the one troublesome onot in tghe film
. that is simpley because the character is such a gr
and
and complete liar
, thgat one almost faults the performence for it
. director sam mendes h
andles all of the particulars of the cast annd the settings iwth a sure
and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle
. scenes of carolyn walking through the rain
, cary an ominous fission that calls attension to the emotions of the chracter
. the subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful
, capturing the season in all of it
' s harsh beauty
( fall has never looked so inviting
,
yet depressing
)
. every nsuance ofthe
" american beauty
" begs it
' s audience to think
and examine
. it isnt a film that will be discussed adn debated for years to come
.
and well it should
, as it is simpley one of this yeras best
.
