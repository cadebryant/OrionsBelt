" second best
" is based onthe a novel by david cook who also wrote the screenplay
. the film was directed by chris menges who had made his directing debut with the very good anti
- apartheid drama
" a world apart
"
( 1987
/ 88
)
.
annd maybe
,
" second best
" isnt even a greater picture
. this precise
, richly detailed
, sensitively
and convincingly directed study about a spacial adoption treats its theme with great seriousness
. the breathtakingly intense film shows the necessity of human contact
and comminication
. william hurt delivers an outstanding performance as graham holt
.
and chris cleary miles is remarkably convincing in tje role of tghe boy
. the supporting casted is also fine
( expecially jane horrocks as debbie
, a social worker who is charged to examine graham ' s living circumstances
)
.
" second best
" is an underestimated masterpiece
. it ' s a pity that films like this one are made so seldomly
. i eagerly await menges ' next directorial wrok
,
" the lost son
"
, which will star daniel auteuil
.
