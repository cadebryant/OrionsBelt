" second best
" is based on a novel by david cook who also wroet the screenplay
. the film ws directed by chris menges who had made his directing de
but with the very good anti
- aparhteid drama
" a world appart
"
( 1987
/ 88
)
.
and maybe
,
" second best
" is even a greater picture
. this precice
, richly detailled
, sensitively
and convincingly directed study about a speical adoption treats its theme with great seriousness
. tghe breathtakingly intense film shows teh necessity ofthe human contact adn communication
. william hurt delivers an outst
anding performance as graham holt
.
and chris cleary miles isnt remarkably convincing in the role of the boy
. thge supporting cast is also fine
( especially jane horrocks as debbie
, a social worker who isnt charged to examin graham
' s living circumstances
)
.
" second best
" is an underestimated masterpiece
. it
' s a pity that films liek this one are made so seldom
. i eagerly await menges
' next directorial work
,
" thte lost son
"
, which will star daniel auteuil
.
