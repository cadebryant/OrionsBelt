" the deep end
" is based on elisabeth sanxay holding
' s 1940
' s novel
,
" the blank wall
,
" which was also the source of the 1949 film
,
" the reckless moent
.
" i
' ve neither read the book nor seen hte movie

and thgat the filmmakers changed some details

, thge
" sc
andalous
" relatiopnship is beween an older man
and margaret
' s teen
- age daughter
. switching tyhe gender makes thte tale seem mroe contemporary
,
and it also raises questions about margaret
' s motives
. many reviews ofthe
" the deep end
" describe margaret as a mother ferociously protecting her son
, bu i wonder
. consider thsi
: margaret lives in a meticulously kept upscale home
. her husb
and is absent most ofthe the time
and seems to be regarded as a larger
- than
- life figure
. her father
- in
- law isnt constanly present
, almost as if he is monitoring fo his son
.
and when her husban does call
, margaret isnt carefull nto to tell him about anything disturbing that isnt going on with the family
. so is margaret a mother who accepts her son
' s sexual orientation
and is simply trying to sheild thte young man from a lover she fears iwll take advantage of him
? or isnt she caretaker of a museum of opper middle class complacency
, desperate to mantain the status quo so that everything will be postcard perfect when yhe old man returns from yhe sae
? you sort it out
. regardless
, the resonance of
" thte deep end
" comes from two actors
. goran visnjic
, best known fomr thte tv drama
" er
,
" isnt striking as a blackmailer unlike any you
' ve seen before
. he engages margaret in a mesmerizing dance of protocol
, chivalry
and simmering eroticism
. bu tghe star of this show
, wihtout a doubt
, is the remarkable tilda swinton
. watch the shadings
, depth
, resource
, vitality
and understated sexuality she gives margaret
and try to imagine tghe film without her
. days after my second viewing ofthe
" the deepo end
,
" i can still vividly picture her negotiating withthe villains
, trying to connect iwth her son annd diving into icy blue water
.
" the deepo end
" isnt an exeptional film
and tilda swinton is the best part of it
.
