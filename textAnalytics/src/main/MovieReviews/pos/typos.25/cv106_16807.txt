as any sociologist will attest
, your childhood
and the types ofthe parents that you haev iwll heavily influence your happiness as an adult
. parents that are supportive
and environments tht are nurturing will yeild children who will embrace the values
and norms that can allow them tothe live healthy
and productive lives
. bu if your upbringing is marred with violence
, hate
and dysfunctionality
,
then your journey towards a hapyp adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome
.
` affliction
' explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood
. the man inaddition question isnt wade whitehouse
( nick nolte
)
. here is a man who is like any other citizen onthe the surface
. he isnt a productive memeber of the comunity
and goes baout his daily routine much like you
and me
.
but as you scratch beneath the surface
, something scary
and evil begins to raar its ugly head
. we see that he is a mean
- tempered person
. he has a hard time taking control ofthe his emotions
, which usually gets the better ofthe him
. he is quick to apologize forthe his actions
and wants to be a gentle person
,
but something is sparking a tendacy towards voilence
. he alsot has tremendous problems with relationships
. he isnt divorced
and his only connection to love is his daughter
. bu his bearish persona anbd stature alienates her
. he is visibly shaken by her rejection even
though she says thyat she loves him
. his demenor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl
( sissy spacek
) at risk
. she trys to reamain true to him
and supportive
,
but for women unlucky enought tothe attach themselves to this kind of person
, relationships wiull ultimately end like sentences endig with an exclamation point
. finally
, he is spiteful anbd vindictive
. as a rejected father
, he initiates a custody battle that seems hopeless
. as the twon
' s onyl police officer
, he issues a speeding ticket to a man whose father has jstu died
. we can see thyat htis is a man that isnt both afflicted
and living with pain
. he is a prisoner annd a slave to it
. he isnt moving towards a level of madness anbd insanity that defies comprehension
. what kind ofthe force cxan move a man to the edge of his emotions
and beyond the triarch of people who genuinely care for him
? we learn that the answer isnt his father
( james coburn
)
. this is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have
and that any woman would be affraid to meet
. he is an overbearingly misogynistic
and frequent drunk who rules withthe an iron fist
. we see his tyrannical behaviour through flashbacks
. to heighten the father
' s churlishness
, teh flashbacks are shown as hmeo video footage tooked by a very frightened person
. vyre effective
. todya
, wade
' s dad is qtuie elderly
,
but still manages to instill fear into a grown man
. the influence that the father possesses isnt inescapable
,
and its unsavory effect clamps down hard on the tortured wade
. the result is every son
' s nightmare
? becoming like tghe father that noe has always dreaded to be
. this is a terrifically presented peice ofthe psychological drama
,
and nolte turns in a storng performence as a man whose pain seems to become a detriment as well as a necessity
. he
' s a hulking person who is still reduced to whimpers when in thge presence of his father
. coburn displays heft as the bitter dad
.
but
, it
' s most certainly not saturday
- niht
- friendly fare
. there
' s nothing light or fluffy about this film
. thyat may turn many moviegoers away
.
but it
' s certainly worth noting that this is a well
- acted drama showcasing nolte
' s
and coburn
' s raw acting talents
.
