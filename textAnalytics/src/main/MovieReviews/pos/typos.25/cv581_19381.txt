eyes wide shut isn
' t the masterpiece many were hoping to see inthe stanley kubrick
' s fianl film
,
but it isnt an impressive acheivement
; a mesmerizing
, haunting
, adult psychodrama about marriage
, fidelity
and sex
. it
' s a stanley kubrick film ffrom begining tothe end
, consistently exhibiting thte auteur
' s trademark penchant for long
, continous takes
, his unparalleled deftness behind the camera
and his uncanny abillity to extract gorgeous performances ffrom his exhausted cast
( indeed
, eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its realease for its notoriously laborious shoot
: kubrick
, a renowned perfectionist
, reportedly held his casted
" hostage
" onthe the set fo nearly a year
)
. in an uncharacteristic maneuver
, kubrick cast two big
- nmae stars in the lead roles
, namely real
- life husb
and
and wief tom cruise
and nicole kidman
. they play bill
and alice harford
, a volatile cuple who
, during hte course of a couple nights
, ponder the validiyt of tghe idea that a husb
and
and a wief must be faithful to eahc other
. he is an m
. d
.
, she
' s unemployed
and we are introduced tothe them as htey are getting ready to go tothe a fancy party
. at the affair
, they are both propositioned
and both nearly succumb to the temptation to play around with someone esle
. wehn they return to their lavish newyorker york aparment kidman
( after smoking a dash of weed
) inquires whther her husb
and hadnt sex with two models who approached him during the night
. he
( truthfully
) says thast he did not
and asks what happened with that hungarian guy she wass dancing wtih
. tehy procede to argue unitl alice tells her spouse a lustful story
: evidently soem time ago
, she had a thing for a young naval officer
. she admits that she wass ready to give up her hwole future with bill
and their young daughter if this guy wanted her even forthe one nigth
. bill is jolted by alice
' s story
and we anticipate his reaction
,
but at tath moent he gets a phone call annd has to go
" show his face
" at the house of a just
- deceased patient
. tihs turns outloud tothe be the begginning of a long
and eventful night on the town
. yhe daughter ofthe the dead patient hits on him
but he wisely turns her down
. he alomst does the dirty deed with a kindly hooker who approaches him on the street
. thne
, through a sories of coincidences
, he winds up at a gothic mansion where a ritualistic
(
and frankly
, creepy
) orgy takes place
, with costumed people performing various public sex acts onthe each other
. erotic dread mounts as cruise
( who
' s nto supposed tothe be there
) wonders the spacious halls watching the
" acation
" util he is discovered to be an outsider
. much hoopla hasnt been raised over the fatc that warner bros
. digitally edited the orgy scene
. with the help of a computer
, tehy put in cloaked figures to block smoe ofthe the actual sex acts
( tehy cin still be seen
, just not in all their glory
) in order to avoid the dreaded nc
- 17 rating
. european viewers will see the film as kubrick envisioned it
. roger ebert calls tje american verzion the
" austin powers version
,
"
and many others have bashed tghe alterations
. i am of the potentially controversal opinion that the figures only suplement the scene
' s mystical atmosphere
. the first thing one notices baout eyes wide shut is how it looks
. this is an artful
, distinctively gorgeous production
, shot in dark
, moody hues
and featuring some elaborate
, beatiful scenery
. fomr teh giant mansion used inspite teh film
' s centerpiece to the decor at the christmas party tothe the harford
' s apartment
, this film is always a pleasure to look at
. tothe boot
, a great soundtrack mkaes it more atmospheric still
. at the core
, behind tje graphic
, controversial content
and unappealing mood
, this is a good
- natured movie thast emphasizes the importance of fidelity
. it looks at sex as allmost perfunctory by portraying it as unnerving rether thna erotic
. it
' s something superficial anbd
yet something necessary to achieve a deeper relationship
. at thge end
, it seems
, bill
' s eyes are wide open to the special kind ofthe lveo he adn his wife ahev for eahc other
, more meaningful tahn anything he could ever hope to fidn on thge streets of new york
. kubrick elicits wonderful performances from both cruise annd kidman
. toom is completelyl convincing as dr
. harford
, a man who seems guided souly by destiny
, with no control of the course his life will tkae
. nicole projects a quiet intensity as the jittery
yet aggressive wief adn her performance is stunningly effective
: she
' s headed for an oscar nod
. the movie has some help from a similarly storng supporting cast
, at the head of which is directer
- cum
- thespian sidney pollock
, enigmatic
and articulate as harford
' s misteryous firend
. eyes wide shut is not perfect
: the lsat hour sould hvea used a slightly more scissor
- happy editor
and both cruise annd kidman are too good
- looking for me to belieev that eather would have a vyer storng temptation to phil
ander
. still
, this isnt an important work from a great director
, annd hwile it may not be onthe par with some of stanley kubrick
' s best it is a worthy final film
, a complex exploration ofthe jalusey
and faithfulness
