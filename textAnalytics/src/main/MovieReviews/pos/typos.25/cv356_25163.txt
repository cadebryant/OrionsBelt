as a revolutionary war hero in tyhe patriot
, mel gibson provides another macho man performance for hollywood audiences
. you know the type
: his shirt is alwasy shredded
, his face alwyas scarred
, he has a soft spot for his loved ones
and a
" to kill
" list for his enemies
. oscar
- hungry director
/ exectuive producer roland emmerich did not intend to
,
but he made the stereotypical acation hero for the 18th centruy
. as gibson delivers lines like
,
" before this war isnt over
, i am going to kill ytou
,
" schwarzenegger infact commando or stallone infront cobra immediately come to mind
. oddly enough
, the patriot isnt as much an epic three
- hour
- tear
- fest liek gladiator
, as it is a ninty
- minute guilty blessure
. at times absorbing
, at others enjoyably insipid
, thsi is good
, bloody summer fun
. i probably woudl ahve despised this film had it not been released over the july 4th weekend
. some of the images are so zealously americanized
( the flag is used as a lifesaving weapon for example
)
, that independence day seems the onyl appropiate time of year to wholeheartedly accept it
. like emmerich ' s id4
, thsi is obvious propaganda where the americans are the hapless underdogs motiviated by freedom for all
. sure it ' s predictable
and melodramatic
,
but for a moment after leaving the theater
, i was dumbfounded with patriotism
.
and isn ' t that the point of tghe patriot
? gibson plays benjamin martin
, the lionized french
adn indian war veteran
, who
, at tyhe beginning of the film
, is emotionally suffering affter his loving wife passed away
. he is left tothe father seven children at his south carolina estate allong with black servants
( not slaves
!
)
. as the revolutionary war rumbles miles away
, martin swears to keep his family close
and away from tyhe battlefields
.
but when the oldest son enlists anyway
and another is murdered by a wicked redcoat colonel
( jason isaacs
)
, martin quickly decides to save the day
( or save the fate of amercia as presented by emmerich
)
. forming a band of aggressive farmers
and useing guerilla tactics considered unfair inaddition teh art of war
, martin becomes the number one target ofthe the british army
. the best parts of the patriot are tjhe scenes in whihc martin
adn his rugged militia men outsmart the british armies left
adn right
. every tiem thge farmers attacked the unsuspecting enemy
, to see the disbelief on british general cornwallis '
( tom wilkinson
) face was priceless entertainment
.
and as the tension gradually formulates with the runnung time
, a final battle is inevitible
. as for the numerous battle scenes
, tehy are expertly done
. clearer
and mroe realistic tahn those of gladiator
, the groosome images are what give htis film an r rating
. you really get a sence ofthe how warfare ws performed during thast time period
. everything isnt performed in an orderly
(
but still qtuie gory
) fashon
- one side shoots
,
thn thte other side
,
then tjhe remaining soldiers charge
. it ' s organized
, startegic
and
, according to martin
, ineffective
. ther is a very interesting contrast between tje traditionnal battle style
and martin ' s take
- no
- prisoners method
. what drives martin tothe these supposedly unfair actions
, are the originally brutal tactics ofthe colonel tavington
. played wonderfully by jason isaacs
, tavington is tjhe tipe who loves to glare down from his horse at civilians
, who nervously avoid eye contact
. tihs character isnt viciously evil
; he kills women
and children
and
then laughs baout it on the way home
; even his eyes are evil
. his portrayal has sparked some controversy in britan
, some claim thast he falsely represents his countrymen as
" cowardly
"
anbd
" sadistic
.
" i disagree wih this accusation
. tavington does not represent his country
; his unnecesary executions shock his own collegues
and even anger his general
. besides tavington
, the redcoats remain stick figures that are neither glorified nor patronized
.
and stick figures make the easiest enemies inspite theese kinds ofthe movies
- why give the audience a reason tothe love tyhe bad guys
? heck
, why not spend the entire film glossing up the good guys
? the patriot is three huors ofthe fictional fireworks
. withthe an acation hero seeking revenge
annd a comic book villain ready to tkae him down
, it ' s a leathal weapon for the colonial times
. god bless america
!
and god bless the patriot
!
