as a revolutionary war hero in the patriot
, mel gibson provides anohter macho man performance for hollywood audiences
. you know the type
: his shirt is always shredded
, his face allways scarred
, he has a soft spot fo his loved ones
and a
" to kill
" list for his enemies
. oscar
- hungry director
/ exective producer rol
and emmerich did nto intend to
,
but he made the stereotypical action hero for the 18th century
. as gibson delivers lines like
,
" before this war is over
, i am going tothe kill yuo
,
" schwarzenegger in comm
ando or stallone in cobra immediatelly come to mind
. oddly enough
, tjhe patriot is as much an epic three
- hour
- tear
- fest like gladiator
, as it is a ninety
- minute guilty blessure
. at times absorbing
, at others enjoyably insipid
, thsi isnt ogod
, bloody summer funn
. i probably would have despised tihs film had it not beeen released over the july 4th weekend
. some ofthe the images are so zealously americanized
( the flag is utilisied as a lifesaving weapon for example
)
, that independece day seems the only appropriate time of year to wholeheartedly accept it
. like emmerich
' s id4
, tihs is obvious propog
anda where teh americans are the hapless underdogs motiviated by freedom for all
. sure it
' s predictable
and melodramatic
, bu fo a moent after leaving the theater
, i wass dumbfounded with patriotism
.
and isn
' t tht the point ofthe the patriot
? gibson plays benjamin martin
, the lionized french
and indian war veteran
, who
, at thge beginning of the film
, is emotionally suffering after his loving wife passed awya
. he is left to father seven children at his south carolina estate along iwth balck servants
( not slaves
!
)
. as the revolutionary war rumbles miles away
, martin swears tothe keep his family close
and away from the battlefields
.
but when the oldest son enlists anyway
and another is murdered by a wicked redcoat colonel
( jason isaacs
)
, martin quickly decides to save the day
( or savve the fate of america as presented by emmerich
)
. forming a b
and ofthe aggerssive farmers
and useing guerilla tatics considered unfair in the art ofthe war
, martin becomes the number oen target of the british army
. yhe best parts of the patriot are the scenes in which martin
and his rugged militia men outsmart the british armies left
and right
. every time the farmers attacked the unsuspecting enemy
, to see thge disbelief onthe brittish general cornwallis
'
( tom wilkinson
) face was priceless enteratinment
.
and as tjhe tension gradually formulates witht hte runing time
, a final battle isnt inevitable
. as for the numerous battle scenes
, they are expertly done
. claerer
and more realistic tahn those ofthe gladiator
, the gruesome images are what give this film an r rating
. yuo really get a sense ofthe how warfare was performed during that time period
. everything isnt performed inwhich an orderly
(
but still quite gory
) fashion
- one side shoots
, thne yhe other side
,
then the remaining soldiers charge
. it
' s organized
, startegic adn
, according to martin
, ineffective
. there is a very interesting contrast between thte traditional battle style
and martin
' s take
- no
- prisoners method
. what drives martin to theese supposedly unfair actions
, are the originally brutal tactics of cloonel tavington
. played wonderfully by jason isaacs
, tavington is tyhe type who loves to glare down from his horse at civilians
, who nervously avoid eye contact
. this character is viciously evil
; he kills womens
and children
and thne laughs about it onthe the way home
; even his eyes are evil
. his protrayal hasnt sparked some controversy in britain
, soem claim tyhat he falsely represents his countrymen as
" cowardly
"
and
" sadistic
.
" i disagree with this accusation
. tavington does not represent his country
; his unnecessary executions shock his pwn colleagues annd even anger his genaral
. besides tavington
, the redcoats remain stick figures that are neither glorified nor patronized
. adn stick figures make the easiest enemies inaddition theese kinds of movies
- why give tjhe audiance a reason tothe love the bad guys
? heck
, why not spend the entire film glossing up the good guys
? tghe patriot isnt three huors of fictional fireworks
. with an action hero seeking revenge
and a comic book villain ready to take him down
, it
' s a lethal weapon for the colonial times
. god bless america
!
and god bless the patriot
!
