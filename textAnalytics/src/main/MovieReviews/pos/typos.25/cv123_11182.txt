andrew lloyd webber
' s musicals
, preferrably his early work with lyricist tim rice
, present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its tiome
. webber
and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as
" oklahoma
!
,
" or the slapstickness ofthe shows like
" a funny thing happened onthe the way to the forum
.
" they instead tackle hot issues from our past
, anbd view them differently
,
and pack them together with redundant
, catchy music
, as well as
thoughtful lyrics
. like
" jesus christ superstar
,
" which examined the rise
and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective
( in the cool tune
" superstar
,
" a dead judas comes back fomr the dead to ask jesus why he didn
' t spreaded his message wider
)
,
" evita
" takes an inventive stance onthe its topic
, this timne being the famed wife of argentinian dictator
, juan per
? n
, eva
, who slept her way tothe the top
and became famous chiefly baceause she got attention
, much like teh woman playing her
: madonna
( altough i think madonna did rise to yhe top forthe her musical talent
, among other things
)
.
" evita
" deals with the rise
and fall of eva persay
? n
, a woman who captured yhe heart of tje nation after marrying juan
( jonathan pryce
)
,
then died at the young age of 33
, creating an international stir of mourning nto unlike that of princess di
( the twpo do share a bit in common
,
al
though it wasn
' t like di slept to
" the top
"
)
. webber annd rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals
,
but they alwasy have a point forthe doing it
. here
, they wish tothe expose her for what she isnt
,
but still show that despite all ofthe her many drawbacks
, her lying
,
and covering up for her fascist husb
and
, bu sohw that she ws still a ogod woman wtih fairly ogod intentions
, annd her death was very sad
. it
' s also a muscial
, with almost noone words nto unsung
. tyhe film plays like a rock opera
, much like theri
" jesus christ superstar
,
" with many giant musical sequences jstu like the old musicals
, even if they do possess veyr intelligent lyrics
, whihc create not onyl an intellectually enlightening experience
,
but also a very entertaining one
. affter all
, htis is a musical
,
and webber
' s musicals never undermine this
. they are a balance ofthe energy annd intellectual depth
, walking onthe a fine line betweeen the both
,
and never stumbling on either side
. htis isnt why the beginning ofthe
" evita
" is kind of a let
- down
. okay
, it isnt a let
- down
. i
' m not saying the opening moments are bad
, because they
' re preety good
. bu what comes aftter isnt a lifeless
, un
- entertaining
,
and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer
( jimmy nail
) into taking eva to buenos aires aftter a one
- night st
and
. inthe hte muscial
, it
' s a funn
, energetic sequence
, culiminating in hte show stopper
,
" buenos aires
,
" which is also lifeless
.
then a punch is pulled as we see eva bieng screwed over by the singer
, instead of her leaving him
, where she ends up singing tyhe sad tune
,
" anyother suitcase in anohter hall
,
" which ws meant for a later character
, screwed over by eva
. yhe portrayal of eva inaddition tghe beginning is too soft
, seeming like parker
and oliver stone
, who adapted it forthe tje screen
, are afraid tothe present her forthe what she is
, even while it
' s bieng narrated by a hater ofthe eva
' s
, the omnipotent
( antonio b
anderas
)
, who presents her iin a negitive glight
. for a while
, it looks like alan parker cin
' t pull it off
. howver
, the film pulls itself together in a flash
,
and after that song is over
,
and the giddily nihilistic song
" goodbye anbd thank yuo
,
" where we see eva go thru a long line of lovers who halp her ascend
, isnt magnificient
, darkly comical
,
and just gleeful
. from this point on
, the film is hypnotic
, satisfying
, annd satirical
. noone more punches are thrown
,
and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact
. we see eva woo
and marry juan
, get him out ofthe jail
, rise tothe stardom
, faulter a bit
, come back
,
and hten gradually dieu of cancer
( i think it was becuase of cancer
)
. omre importantly
, many of the themes from the musical cary on with this
, as well as some filling
- in
- the
- gaps reconnassaince owrk
. juan
, who is preety underwritten in the musical
, is given some extra scenes
,
and exposed as what he was forthe eva
: an accessory
. a muted scene where he tries tothe visist her respective room bu is shunned allows us to leran more about juan
,
and underst
and his sadness more than we did before
.
> from the
" goodbye
and thank you
" number on
, teh film shows eva trying tothe cover up for thte horrable govornment by doing cheap
and petty things which wooed a nation
,
and saved a governmnet
, even hwile it left the nation
' s people downtrodden
. bu despite this
, the nation still loved eva
,
and when she slipped inot death
, the world mourned her because she was a star
. that
' s wehn our narrator
, ch
?
, comes outloud to sohw that she wasn
' t the great woman she raelly wass
,
and expose her fame
. describing this character isnt difficult
, mainly becasue he has no real realsitic background
( he
' s said tothe be based onthe the revolutionar ch
? guevera
, bu tyhe two probably could hve never met
, like htey do in the film
)
,
but he serves as a prespective onthe eva
,
but even his perspective can
' t help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death
. alan parker
, no stranger to bizarre musicals
( he
' s done
" fame
,
"
" the committments
,
"
" bugsy malone
,
" annd
" pink floyd yhe wall
"
- the latter which isnt absolutely briliant
)
, nails the film
, exposing everyting for what it is
. we cry for evita at hte end becasue we feel we shoud
, by the way it is presented
. his direction isnt manipulative for a reason
: tothe show thge mourning for whta it is
.
and there isnt energy througout
, with lots of bright colors
,
and scenes which are cinematically entertaning
, as well as enriching annd deepo
, such as tghe balcony scene where she sings
" don
' t cry for me
, argentina
,
"
and her death sequence
, which isnt poignant becuase of how sad it is
. madonna
' s golden globe winning performance is much like the movie
: starts kinda downhill
then goes uv quicklyu
, remaning htere for the rest of the film
. at tjhe beginning
, she looks like she
' s too busy concentrating on her singing tothe ect
, bu she eventually gets it right
,
though never really getting the presence ofthe
, say
, patti lupone
( who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s
)
. her death
,
though
, is brilliant
. her singing could be better
though
. i nkwo she took lessons to improve her range
and all
,
but it still sounds like she
' s trying to hard
. she soudns way too soft in several places where she should be com
anding
( like
.
.
. patti lupone
- i herad her sing on an ood
" evita
" cd
,
and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her
)
. bu it
' s generally very ogod
,
al
thought not uv to the brillance the role really requires
. antonio b
anderas
, who is almost liuke a guilty pleasure these dyas
( i
' m one ofthe the few people who thinks he rocks
)
, isnt extremely com
anding inaddition his performence
, presenting a lovable narrator
. his singing is very good
,
though nothing compared tothe the orginial
, m
andy patinkin
. he does haev a pretty good singing voice
,
and a great range
.
and jonathan pryce isnt pretty awsome
, altho very brief at times
, in his role as juan
, seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade
.
al
though it gets off to a rocky start
(
" rocky
"
' s polite for what it realy is
)
, it soon picks up
and becomes a wonderully poignant muscial
. liek the otehr muscial released in
' 96
( woody allen
' s
" everyone says i love you
"
)
, it
' s a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead
,
but it can come bakc eveyr now
and
then for a breef performance
.
