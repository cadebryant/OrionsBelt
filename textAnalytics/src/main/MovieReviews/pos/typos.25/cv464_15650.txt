. steven spielberg may nto have directed
( he only eecutive produced
)
but his touch certainly is evident infront htis movei
. adn he knows a money making winner when he sees oen
. the mask of zorro has the hallmarks of a blockbuster
: big action
, funny comedy
, anbd the pacing of a rollercoaster
. hopkins plays don diego de la vega
, otherwise known as zorro
. a fighter fo the people
, he is eventually capturd by don rafael montero
( stuart wilson
)

, unintentionally
, kills his wife

andro murrieta
( b
anderas
) to become the new zorro
. b
anderas motive
? tothe avenge the death of his brother
, who was killed at tghe h
ands of captain love
( matthew letscher
) who rether tastefully keeps tyhe head inwhich a jar
, in one of the more graphic scenes in this family movei
. with the scene setted
, the movei goes on full blast
, wih sword fights a
- plenty adn witty one liners
. b
anderas
and hopkins have a marvellous chemestry as the two zorro
' s
, playing each other off whith ease
. hopkins seems to come off a little better
,
but b
anderas doesnt smoe excellent wokr
. as the bad guys
, wilson
and letscher seem one dimensional
,
but they go through hte bad guy shtick in an above average way
. thge audience does hite them
, hwihc cin
' t be bad
. catherine zeta
- jones also pops up as hopkins daugter
,
and
al
thought she provides little moreso than hte usual female lead
, she delivers a charming
,
but one onot
, performance
. tghe chemistry is excellent between b
anderas
and jones
. htere
' s a delightful little scene where b
anderas
and jones have a sword fight
,
and every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed
, until jones clothes fall off all together
. the directer
, fresh ffrom the enjoyable goldeneye
( 1995
) h
andles the film perfectly
. the acation is well done
and fast paced
, hte comedy put across well
. the casted halp a lot
,
but thte direction is still outst
anding
.
al
though the film is very long
, the plot keeps chugging allong
,
and htere
' s bearly a dull moment
.
however
, tje film is a littel over indulgent
,
and it sould have been trimmed
. it manages tothe hold the attention
, thankfully
,
and the adventure
and charm holds right uv to yhe last reel
. screenwriters john eskow
, ted elliot anbd terry rosio hvae unfortunately written an cliched annd one dimensional script
.
al
though they
' ve buyed zorro uv to date with big explosions annd wild action
, the plot itself is bearly existent
. there
' s lots of little sub plots hanging aroud
, bu there
' s nothing substantial to bring them all together
. the main story seems tothe be the fact tath rafael wants tothe
' buy
' california using gold stolen from the guy he
' s buying the l
and off
. this sets up fo a temple of doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven inot getting the gold from littel mines
.
however
, this doesn
' t seem to appear unitl nearly over a hour into the film
, so the film is never quite sure where it
' s going
. in the end
however
, zorro provides acation
and comedy in spades
. it suitable for everyone
, so put the guilt behind
,
and put some more mony into spielbergs bank account
. you won
' t regret it
.
