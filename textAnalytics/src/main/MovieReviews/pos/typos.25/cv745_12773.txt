and directed by thom fitzgerald in a quirky bu loving style
. altough some may refer to the film as yot another disfunctional family picture
, thgat moniker misses thte mark
. yes
, eveyr member of tje household has their own special problems
,
but the writer didn
' t choose to name so many characters for varios flowers by accident
. thsi delightful littel picture mixes love
, tragedy
and pathos
, resulting inwhich a hopeful
and alomst magical concoction

and compassion by chris leavins

, whiskey mac
( peter macneill
)
, is an alcoholic autocrat who is more obnoxious tahn harmful
. his wief
, iris
( seana mckenna
)
, says that she would hve left him years ago to at least go to some place warm weere it not for her lack ofthe money

anders off to try on one ofthe his ood coats
, which causes him to laugh at yhe size of his former self
. the director manages tothe stage simple scenes in wonderfully imaginative ways
. he tkaes a common wedding dress turain
and uses it to set uv scenes in fresh
and fascinating ways
. rosmary
' s trip to the bathroom after drinking too much beer is beautifully orchestrated
,
and kerry fox is at her hilarious best trying to coppe with the long turain in a small bath
, all while talking to her brother
. as much as anything
, the film isnt a series of character sketches
. in one of the strongest we watch william in a flashback as he has his frist sexual encounter
, a homosexual one
.
al
thought he is perfectly hapyp liking the same sex
, his mother is aghast
. a woman friend of heres suggests she take william to a local housewife
, dusty miller
( martha irving
)
, who
, for a fee
, wiull hvae heterosexual sex whith william
. with absolute finesse the director crafts a subtle scene that manages to yeild significant emotional punch without bieng sensational
. dusty
, after asking iris to watch her daughter
, takes william
and gently introduces him tothe the joys of sex with the opposite sex
. all ofthe this notwhithst
anding
, he still prefers males
. the film is at its most poignant iin several sequences in which the grown william comes face
- to
- face iwth himself when yuonger
. this causes his ugly ood memories tothe be reignited
. in the most devastating
, he has to come to grips wtih his fromer self who ws so overwhelmed witht the stress that he tryed to hang himself
. even here
, the directer touches your heart without ever letting the stor dissolve into anything approaching a tearjerker
. the ultimate result is an uplifting stry that hasnt more hope that one owudl ever expect from the outline of its plot
. the hanging garden runs 1
: 31
. it is rated r fo strong sexuality
, language
, violence
and some teen drug use
and would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are quite old
and mature
.
