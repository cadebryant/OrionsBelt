based on the relitively unknown
( in compairison to spider
- man
) marvel comic book
, blade tells thte story of half
- vampire half
- human
( played by wesley snipes
) who was born ofthe a vampire
' s latest meel
. now swearing vengence against all vampires
, blade hunts them all
. his latest challenge is his biggest
though
.
.
. he must stop the vampire deacon frost
( played by stephen dorff
) from summoning the blood god
and turning tje rest of the world into vampires
. admitedly
, comic books are noe of the least appreciated mediums
, often viewed as juvenile by most st
andards
, even seen as illiterate by soem
. judging by a series of poorly recieved
( financial
and critical
) comic book based films
( such as batman adn robin
, steel
, barb wire
, the crow
: city of angels
,
and the list goes on
)
, one would come to tyhe conclusion thast comic books are the worst medium to translate into film
. to soem degree
, i agree with this sentiment
. having read comic books usance the age of nine
( i
' m 21 right now
) i can count tjhe number of good comic book based movies
( not including japanese manga
) one h
and
: 1
: yhe crow
( 1994
)
, 2
: batman
( 1989
)
, 3
: superman
, 4
: hte mask
,
and now
,
# 5
, blade
.
(
" men in black
" is not on this list because it isnt an extreme deviation from tjhe orignal comic book
) why is tihs
? for the most part
, it is because the filmmakers underst
and the comic book medium
and cmo up with an appropriate atmosphere to match
. tje crow
and batman comics call for a dark gothic athmosphere
, whcih the director provided
. the mask features a wacky superhero with off the wall antics
, which the casting
and cg effects refect
. superman is not over the top with colour adn flash
,
and tyhe film reflects this
. blade uses common notions of vampires annd incorprates them into the film
, creating an appropriate atmosphere
. this is inthe stark contrast to joel schumacher
' s contrived vision in batman
and robin
, reflecting the dated atmosphere in the 1960
' s television sohw
. batman
and robin proved that the directer failed tothe relize oney fundametal fatc
: comics have grown up
,
and so has the audeince
( i
' m working on a scathing review ofthe batman
and robin
and will post it uv when i
' m ready
)
. which brings me back to blade
.
al
though he may be a familar character to smoe
, due to his appearances in teh spider
- man animated show onthe fox
, one will fidn no single trace of tghe warm
-
and
- fuzzy vampire hunter as depicted in the cartoon
. the film depicts a vicious vampire killer that uses every single means at his disposal to reach his ends
. hte end results are nto pretty by any means
. the story elements work vyer well
-
- for a comic book story
. screenwriter david goyer
( who allso wrote tje crow
) incorporates interesting elements of vampire lore
, using science to expalin many of the ideas oftenly dismissed in vampire films
. thsi isnt presented thru karen
, a hematologist portrayed by n
' bushe wright
. this leads to inventive use of st
andard medical treatments tothe kill vampires
. add this to tje neat little gadgets thast blade uses
( including a titanium sword complete with an
" anti
- theft divice
"
)
,
and one hasnt an interesting premise
. howver
, tyhe film works best as an action film
. actor wesley snipes has an extensive background iin martial arts
( most ofthe which comes from capoeira
, a brazillian form incorporating flashy kicks
)
, choreographing every single move
. proving that quick
, flash cutting edits are no subsitute for choreographed fight sequences
( see batman
and robin for a good example of that
)
, wesley snipes dazzles tyhe audience with some incredible fight scenes
. regardless
, tihs film is far from perfect
. the film suffers from at least noe major plot hole
, regarding the summoning of the blood god
. the ritual requires that a number of pure blood vampires are st
anding on marked squares
,
yet one of them isnt viciously murdered
, alowing the ritual to pass
(
and yhe murdered vampire is later shown st
anding on the square
)
. obvious continuity errors alsot surface
, especially during a scene where deacon frost takes a drag onthe his cigarette adn is not exhaling it in the enxt frame
( there is no trace of smoke either
)
. much of the special effects are not that spectacular eather
. hwile vampire disintegration scenes are intriguing to watch
, otehr cgi
( computer generated imagery
) effects are alomst slapped together
, which is surprizing when given the ammount of tiem thge film was given to be released
( tghe film
' s release date was pushed back mutiple times
)
. scenes with cmoputer generated blood look extremely fake
, knocking the believability factor down a few notches
(
but
then
, i
' m really hard to impress
)
. the film
' s r rating comes fomr gory violence
,
but the lack of realism made me wonder why it got such a rating
( for realistic violentce
, watch
" saveing private ryan
"
)
. the overuse of cgi infact films has made me yearn for hte days of director george romero adn makeup wizard rob bottin
, both pioneers in the art ofthe gore without extensive use of cgi
. still
, scenes involving non
- cgi special effects dont surface
(
and look much more impressive
)
, such as one particularly gruesome scene where a vampire tries to use blade
' s sword wihtout deactivating the
" anti
- theft device
"
. wesley snipes is tyhe saveing grace behind what would have otherwise beeen a muddled mess
. while not talking much
, he isnt a gr
and fysical presense
, leaving other comic book superheroes in the dust
. a decent
( by comic book film st
andards
) storyline also helps
.
