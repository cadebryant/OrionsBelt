based on yhe relatively unknown
( in comparison to spider
- man
) marvel comic book
, blade tells the story of half
- vampire half
- human
( palyed by wesley snipes
) who was born of a vampire ' s latest meel
. now swearing vengeance against all vampires
, blade hunts them all
. his latest challenge is his biggest
though
.
.
. he must stpo the vampire deacon frost
( played by stephen dorff
) ffrom summoning the blood god
and turning the rest of the world into vampires
. admitedly
, comic books are one of the least appreciated mediums
, oftenly viewed as juvenile by most standards
, even seen as illiterate by soem
. judging by a series of poorly recieved
( finacial
and critical
) comic book based films
( such as batman
and robin
, steel
, barb wire
, the crow
: city ofthe angels
,
and the list goes on
)
, one owudl come to the conclusion that comic books are the worst medium tothe translate into film
. to some degree
, i agree with htis sentiment
. hvaing read comic books sicne the age of nine
( i ' m 21 right now
) i can count the number of good comic book based movies
( not including japanese manga
) oney hand
: 1
: thge crow
( 1994
)
, 2
: batman
( 1989
)
, 3
: superman
, 4
: tghe mask
,
and now
,
# 5
, blade
.
(
" men in balck
" is not on this list because it is an extreme deviation fomr tghe original comic book
) why is this
? for tje most part
, it is beacuse teh filmmakers understand the comic book medium
and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match
. the crow
and batman comics call forthe a dark gothic atmosphere
, whcih the directer provided
. teh mask features a wacky superhero with off hte wall antics
, which tghe casting
and cg effects reflect
. superman isnt not over the top with colour
and flash
,
anbd tjhe film reflects this
. blade uses common notions of vampires
and incorporates them into yhe film
, creating an appropriate atmosphere
. this is iin stark contrast to joel schumacher ' s contrived vision inwhich batman
and robin
, reflecting the dated atmosphere in the 1960 ' s televsion show
. batman
and robin proved tath the director failed tothe realize oen fundamental fact
: comics have grown up
,
and so hasnt the audience
( i ' m wroking on a scathing review of batman
and robin
and will post it up when i ' m ready
)
. which brings me bakc tothe blade
. altho he may be a familiar character tothe some
, due to his appearances in tghe spider
- man animated show on fox
, one iwll find no single trace ofthe the warm
-
and
- fuzzy vampire hunter as depicted in yhe ctaroon
. the film depicts a vicious vampire killer tath uses every single means at his disposal to reach his ends
. the end results are not pretty by any means
. the story elements wokr veyr well
-
- forthe a comic book story
. screenwriter david goyer
( who also wrote the crowm
) incorporates interesting elements of vampire lore
, using science to explain many ofthe the idesa often dismissed in vampire films
. this is presented through karen
, a hematologist portrayed by n ' bushe wright
. this leads tothe inventive use of standart medical treatments to kill vampires
. add this tothe the neat little gadgets that blade uses
( including a titanium sword complet with an
" anti
- theft divice
"
)
,
and one hasnt an interesting premise
.
however
, the film works best as an action film
. ator wesley snipes hasnt an extensive backround in martial arts
( most of which comes ffrom capoeira
, a brazillian form incorporating flashy kicks
)
, choreographing every single move
. proving that quick
, flash cutting edits are no subsitute fo choreographed fight sequences
( see batman
annd robin for a ogod example ofthe that
)
, wesley snipes dazzles the audience with soem incredible fight scenes
. regardless
, this film is far from perfect
. the film suffers from at least one major plot hole
, regarding the summoning ofthe the blood god
. the ritual requires that a number of pure blood vampires are standing onthe maked squares
,
yet oen of them is viciously murdered
, alowing thte ritual to pass
(
and the murdered vampire isnt later shown standing on the sqaure
)
. obvious continuity errors also surface
, especially during a scene where deacon frost tkaes a drag on his cigarette
and is not exhaling it in the next frame
( there is noone trace of smoke either
)
. much ofthe the special effects are not tyhat spectacular either
. while vampire desintegration scenes are intriguing tothe watch
, otehr cgi
( computer generated imagery
) effects are alomst slapped toghether
, which is surprising when given thge amount of tiem the film was given to be released
( the film ' s release date was pushed back multiple times
)
. scenes with computer generated blood look extemely fake
, knocking the believability factor down a fewd notches
(
but
then
, i ' m really hard to impress
)
. the film ' s r rating comes from gory violence
,
but tyhe lack of realism made me wonder why it got such a rating
( forthe realistic voilence
, watch
" saving private ryan
"
)
. the overuse ofthe cgi in films has made me yearn for teh dyas of director george romero
and makeup wizard rob bottin
, both pioneers in tghe art ofthe gore without extensive use ofthe cgi
. still
, scenes involving non
- cgi speshal effects do surface
(
adn look much more impressive
)
, such as one particularly gruesome scene where a vampire trys to use blade ' s sword wihtout deactivating thge
" anti
- theft divice
"
. wesley snipes isnt tghe saving grace behind what would have otherwise been a muddled mess
. while nto talking much
, he is a grand physical presense
, leaving other comic book superheroes in the dust
. a decent
( by comic book film standards
) storyline alsot helps
.
