it was a rainy friday afternoon in columbus wehn i persuaded a friend to see a matinee peformance of mst3k
: tm
. he had never seen any episodes ofthe thte show
,
and i have watched a scant few
, due to its unsocial airtime on comedy central
and the uneven nature of many ofthe the epidsodes
. for those of you not familiar with the premise
, dr clayton forrester
( beaulieu
) wishes tothe tkae over the world by finding the worst film ever made
and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public
. to achieve this
, he
( infront the words ofthe the tv sories
' theme
, hwihc is missing in the movei
)
" bumped
[ mike nelson
( nelson
)
] on the noggin
and
then shooted him into spoace
"
,
and is monitoring nelson
' s reactions to the movies he is forced to endure
. rather than succumb to the sheer awfulness of many of the movies
, nelson spends his timne making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions
, tom servo
and crow t
. robot
. the fromat of the show consists ofthe nelson
, servo
and crow mkaing thier comments while silhouetted agianst the movie bieng watched
, anbd breaks every 20 mintues or so for segments set on the satellite of love
, the ship on which our heroes are marooned
. only two things are different inspite the movie
: tghe absence of forrester
' s sidekick
, tv
' s frank
, adn the slower pace of the jokes
. this latter chanage is presumeably deliberate to avoid the viewing audiance missing smoe of the best lines while laughing from yhe previous joke
. for their big screen outing
, the producers haev choosen
" this isl
and earth
"
, a 1954 classic
,
and one of the first sf films to have a speshal effects budget larger than the average grocery bill
. unfortunately for that film
(
but making it ideal mst3k fodder
)
, acting
and dialogue appear tothe have taken a back seat to the effects whcih
, by today
' s st
andars
, are less than impressive
. nelson
& co
. amking jokes about everything ffrom japan
' s dominance in the world market
, to star trek
, to the state of disrepair of seattle
' s kingdome
,
and most ofthe them work
. unfortunatly
, thte segments setted outside tghe satelite
' s movei theather seem outloud ofthe place adn aren
' t particularly funny
,
but at least tehy
' re fairly short
. thge big question about htis movie
though is
: why
? i presume it was an attemt to gain a larger following to keep wupport behind the serieses
( rumours of its impending demise circulated fo some time before the plug was evenhtually pulled a few months ago
)
,
but thte format gains nothing fomr its transition tothe the big screen
-
- there are no special effects tothe dazzle you
, no action sequences to keep you on the edge ofthe your seat
,
and no use of digital surround sound
. so
, it seems pointless to spend
$ 8 per person to see this movie when in a fewd months it will be out on video
and yuo can watch it for
$ 3
,
and not have to sit infront a room full of popcorn addicts
. neverthless
, mst3k
: tm provides omre laugh
- out
- loud opportunities than any film you
' re going to see this year
,
and i thoroughly recommend it to anyone withthe a pulse
. given its uniqueness
, i hesitate to grade it against other films
,
but it fulfils its claims adn so in thte class of
" unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expense of bad b
- movies
" it doens well
.
