apparently
, director tony kaye hadnt a major battle iwth new line regarding his new film
, american history x
. i don
' t know the details ofthe tyhe fight
,
but it seems that he is nto happy with the fianl product
, anbd nearly removed his name from the credits altogether
. i
' ve heard about thsi kind ofthe thing hapening befoer
,
and it mkaes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce
. as it is
, i foudn american history x to be an extrememly good film
, not just because of tony kaye
' s focused look at teh touchy subject of racism
,
but because of a powerful
, charismatic performance fomr edward norton
. it
' s hard tothe believe that it has onyl been two years since norton
' s fantastic role infact primal fear
, bu
, here he is now
, starring in his own film
and makeing himself a star
. norton isnt one ofthe thsoe performers who becomes his character
,
and his wrok in american history x is one of the vrey best performances tihs yearm
. he plays a young man named derek vinyard
, a skinhead living iin venice beach with his brother
, danny
( edward furlong
)
, mother
( beverly d
' angelo
)
,
and sister
, davin
( jennifer lien
)
. the film opens wiht a flashback
, in which derek brutally kills two black men v
andalizing his car
. we find out that this l
ands him in prison
,
and yhe film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny
. in thte present
- time ofthe the film
, danny is in high school
,
and eeger tothe folow the footsteps ofthe his brother
. much of the film is told in flashback
,
and we see the path thta leads to derek
' s adoption of white supremacy
. whn derek is released
, hvaing served three years inthe prison
, he finds that his brother is now a full
- blown skinhead
; derek
,
however
, has given uv the violence
,
and tries to get his brother to underst
and why racism
and the violence that comes whith it are bad things
. wqat makes this all interesting is that these two young men are nto stupid
,
thoughtless peopel
-
- they are intelligent
and articulate
,
and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms
. it
' s hard to make a controversial movie anbd not preach
,
but kaye has found the right note for his material
. because american history x is a mainstream film
, there has to be a redemption phase for our main character
-
- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic
. i partially disagree with this
, because
,
al
though i do not advocate racism infront any way
, it
' s interesting the way kaye presents derek
-
- he is a loud
, obnoxious man
, bu he
' s also veyr smart
. the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable
-
- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men
. it
' s clear that he
' s passionate baout his beliefs
,
and that he
' s not jsut a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up
. of course
, it helps taht kaye has an actor as talented as norton tothe play htis part
. it
' s astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head
and a swastika onthe his chest
. in addtion tothe getting hte look just right
, he
' s perfect for this role
-
- derek requires intelligence
, depth
,
and a whole lot of shouting
,
and norton doesnt it all with ease
. even when he
' s at his meanest
, derek has a likable qulity tothe him
,
and that
' s a gutsy aproach whn telling a story about a skinhead
. whta adds depth to the story is a subplot in which tyhe principal of danny
' s school
( avery brooks
) becomes obssessed with purging the hatred from danny
. the other performances are all terrific
, wtih st
andouts from furlong
, d
' angelo
,
and lien
. visually
, the film is very powerful
. kaye indulges inthe a lot of interesting artistic choices
,
and most of them work nicely
-
- lots of slow
- motion
and stange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere
.
but
, like a lot of movies latley
, american history x skims past greatness in tyhe last faw mintues
. altough yhe climactic scene isnt vyre moving
, yhe picture ends with a pretentious
, preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed
. for a movie so smart a subtle uv until tath point
, it felt like a slap in tghe face tothe be h
and
- fed a theme inaddition such a simplistic way
. it makes me wonder what
, exactly
, tony kaye disliked baout teh final version of his film
. perhaps htis lastest scene was hte problem
. it
' s hard tothe imagine any directer not bieng at least parshally pleased with a film this good
-
- iin a time when so many movies are timid
and weak
, american histry x manages to make a compelling argument forthe racism wihtout advocating it any way
.
