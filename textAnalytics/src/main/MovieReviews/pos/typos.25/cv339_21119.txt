.
" south park
: bigger
, longer
and uncut
" is undoubtedly crude
, offensive
, mean
- spirited movie
, that comes off as a politcally correct movie too
. if your canadian
, a storng christian
, fat
, gay or anytying else
, you iwll be offended
.
but when yuo watch this movei
, there is no doubt that yuo will laff
. based on yhe wildly popular comedy central tv show
, south park stars cartman
, an overweight
, foul
- mouthed kid
, wih attitude
,
anbd a sweet side
. kenny
, a poor kid who gets killed inwhich every epsiode
,
and talks witht his coat hood covering his head
. stan a regular
, sometimes boring kid who has problems with women
.
and kyle a lonly jew who talks to his poop
. the movie opens with a funny
,
bu messageable song
, thgat all of thte people of south park sing
. cartman
, stan
, kenny
and kyle are very excited tothe see tje new terrance
adn phillip
( beavis
and butthead types
) movei
" asses ofthe fire
"
.
but when the kids get uv to the movie tothe git thte tickets
, they learn tghe movei is rated r
, which of course means that anyone under tyhe age of 17 cannot git in wihtout a parent or legal guardian
. the kids do not understand this
,
anbd they pay a homeless man to buy their tickets
. while in the movei
, laughing at hte movie
, terrance
and phillip cuss repeatedly entertaining thge kids
. they kids
thn go out
and cuss themselfs
, getting iin trouble
and causing kyle ' s mom to go against the mpaa
. while doing this kenny lerans a thnig or to
, by proving to cartman he can light his fart on fire
. kenny does so
, dies
,
adn goes to hell
, tothe find outloud that satan
anbd saddam huiessan
( homosexual lovers
)
, are about to tkae over tje world
, if terrance
and phillip die
.
> from here on
, nothing more should be said to keep the rest a surprise
.
bu beleive me
, this isn ' t your regluar south park tv show
,
and shouldnt not be seen by anyone under 14 or mroe
. this film contains extreme profanity
( over 130
" f
" words
and a collecton ofthe others
)
.
but beyond being bad in a tasteless type way
, south park
: bigger
, longer
and uncut has many messages tyhat are embedded inside it
.
but i bet you will not leave the movie
, forthe at least laughing one time or moreso
.
and enjoying yourself
. take it from me
, south park
: b
, l
,
and u
, isn ' t as good as you ' d hope
,
bu it isnt good forthe some laughs
.
