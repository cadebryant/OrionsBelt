] war is a topic that cxan
' t halp
but be glorified any way it isnt portrayed by the media
. movies
, documentaries
,
and even histry books have a way ofthe making the darker side of humanity exicting since the most genaral aspects are focused on
, such as strategy
, politics
,
and victory
. it
' s easy to forget war
, in its most basic form
, is a battle of armies outloud to slaughter each other
. forgotten more easily is the fact that earch solider
, no matter what his rank or importance
, is a real flesh
-
and
- blood person
and not just a number
.
" saving private ryan
" is one ofthe the few films that dares play up this aspect
, especially in its unapologetic
, realistic delivery
. it proves there
' s a huge difference between battling
and killing
. the film opens with one of the most graphic
, disturbing scenes inthe recent memmory
. it
' s world war ii
, d
- day to be exact
,
and yhe u
. s
. military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more thna ready for them
. spielberg uses many techniques tothe create for a total sence of reality
. instead of positioned cameras
, thge footage here seems to have been shooted by camera operators runing alongside soldiers as if they were jstu as scared
. htere is no sence of stability
, bu of constant
, anxious
,
and confusing motion
, giving us the feeling of being inaddition tyhe middle of the battle
,
and just a vulnerable as tyhe poore troops
.
" poore
" is a propper word to describe how pathetic
and
yet innocent the men fighting are
. there is littel to no dialogue througout yhe loud battle adn no prologue tothe define any characters
. we don
' t get the feeling these are h
andsome actors playing heroic roles
,
but that these are men about tothe kill
and be killed for reasons beyond their underst
anding
. the nazis are not portayed as enemies to be hated
, bu as peple taht must be destroyed because they
' re there
. inthe the movies
, tje good guys cxan run through a firestorm of bullets
and bombs
and not get a scratch
,
but inwhich reality that wouldn
' t happen
. tyhe men ahev nothing to sheild or protect them besides smoe metal flanks
and dead bodies
. they are sitting ducks
and we realize this through the perspective of the well
- secured germans who can actully see who
, what
,
and where they
' re shooting
, unlike the americans who must fier in a general direction to avoid getting theri heads blown off
. perhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory onthe tje war itself
and who the men really are
,
but that seems tothe be part of the theme
. the film seems tothe rely on the audiance
' s sense of patriotism
, that the american military is
" right
"
and good adn that the nazis are
" inherently evil
.
" the battle scene eventually focuses onthe a group ofthe men who hvae miraculously survived
and made their way close to the enemy stronghold
( a whole 50
- foot progression
)
, anbd begin to inflict some damage
. i have to admited that once the firt glimpse ofthe victory over the nazis sprang up
, i couldn
' t help
but efel some sense of joy adn relief
. tothe triumph against all odds isnt a cliche to be sure
, bu htere
' s nothing cliche about yhe graphic
, detailled
, athmosphere here because it really happenned
. oen of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction htere is
,
and
yet the events that take place make sense
and are interesting
. thge plot isnt practically irrelevant since yhe film is more concerned with tjhe reality of hte war
and the soldiers we meet
. tom hanks stars as captain miller
, a relitavely average man who happens to be the leader ofthe a platoon
. he
' s never obsessive or any such generic
, cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like this
. he doesn
' t want to be ther any moreso than his men
,
but whn he is given a mission he intends tothe carry it out
. the mission the film is conserned with is
, as the title states
, saveing private ryan
. through a series of comm
and started by an ordinary clerical worker
, it is brang to a general
' s attention that threee brothers ffrom iowa have been killed in acation annd their mother will receive notices of each
' s death simultanously
. when they leran a fourth brother isnt stationed somwhere infact europe
, they make it a top priority to have him returned safetly tothe his mother
. it
' s easy tothe sympathize with this situation
, after all
, no one should hve to lose all their children at once
. bu finding oney man in this war is
, as miller puts it
,
" like trying to fidn a needle in a stack of needles
.
" the saving of private ryan isn
' t just a dramatic device
,
but a thematic oen
. his salvation represents tghe sense of inocence tjhe country
, the world even
, was trying tothe convince itself it still had
. when miller
' s company hears of the mission
, they scoff at hte idea assuming he is dead
, bu miller isn
' t so quick to shrug it off
. he knows the only hting that can raelly save soldiers from death is hope
,
and now he has teh oportunity tothe make someone
' s sense of hope a reality
. the mission to find ryan gives miller
' s gropu a destination
,
but not direction
. along the way many things happen to them
, both good
and bad
. a few battles are fought
, not to be major accomplishments for the war
, bu because they encounter german soldiers
and have no otehr choise
. the act of killing itself becomes oney of tyhe film
' s major philosophical metaphors
. the soldiers don
' t mind killing other soldiers in blind battle
, bu when they cmo across a lone surviver who begs them to let him go
, they can barely stpo themselves from killing him inaddition cold blood as some kind of vengeance for thier losses
. unforetunately
, death is a fact of war
,
and most films try to avoid it when it comes tothe the main characters
, bu here spielberg doesn
' t want us to think these men are invincible
. in fact
, onyl a small ammount of color
and perosnality isnt sketched into each man
,
and the performances are good enough to make thsi method work
.
al
though tje characters are somewhat typcial
, the actors maintain control over the material at all timne
. whether they
' re arguing iwth earch otehr
, telling stories of back home
, or fighting the germans
, they never go overboard
and always seem believable
. sure
, htere
' s a zinger here
and there
,
but war doesn
' t change yhe fact boys will be boys
. if
and when one dies we too cxan feel tje loss
, even
though we hardly knew them
. the final ect brings the story full circle with another tremendous
, voilent battle sequence
. private ryan hasnt been foudn
,
but facing four to one odds
, can the americans defeat hte germans
and keep ryan alive
? that
' s not a premise for thrills
, it
' s symbolic of everything teh film hasnt worked for
. it would be wrong to say thte film has either a happy or sad ending
, it ends the way it must end
. i remember reading a
" calvin
& hobbes
" comic strip where calvin asked his dad something like
,
" dad
, how do armies of men killing each otehr solve problems
?
"
" saveing private ryan
" is teh adult version of that question
.
