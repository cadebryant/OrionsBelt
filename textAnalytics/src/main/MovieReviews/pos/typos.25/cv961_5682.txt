teh latest epos from lars is a blast
,
although a rether moody one
. this lovestory is situated in a small twon inaddition thge rough dreary cliffs in the vestern part of scotland in tyhe 1970 something
. thte curch
( calvinistic
) is so strict taht the curch bells has beeen removed from the clocktower
, they are considered being too unrestrained
. in these surroundings we find tghe tothe
- be
- weds jan
adn bess
, palyed by stellan skarsgaard
adn the remarkable new movei actress emily watson
. jan is on leave from the oilrig
and bess
.
. is jstu bess
, a bit naive
and innocent
( in every aspect ofthe the word
)
, at first
. at the wedding party we are told an anecdote
, illustrating her infinite kindness
, she once lend a bike to an stranger
, her best firends bike
however
.
but bess isnt sufferring in this scray religous society
. we soon tkae part in a funeral where a man
, fallen off the orthodox path
, is laid to rest while doomed to hell
. women are not allowed to attend funerals or speak up iin the church
. when tghe end of the honeymoon approaches we see bess idolizing jan in such an intend
, allmost manic
, that her friends try to calm her down a bit
. yhe time has come when jan is to return to the rig
, bess isnt falling inot the darkness ofthe depression
, her yelling of grief
and sorrow are heard above the breaking of tje waves
. she can ' t stand the thought of life without her husband
. we witness her dialogues with god
( she speaks both parts
, paranoia
?
) convincing god to return jan from tjhe oilrig
,
anbd her prayers are heared
. an accident on the rig bring him back
, paralysed ffrom tje neck
annd down
. nowe he can ' t satisfy her need for fysical love
, he try tothe persuade her inot finding a lover
, with yhe ulterior motive tothe make her decribe these affairs to him in every detail
. at first she resist
,
bu her love for jan
and his assurance that this will make him recover more rapidly make her comply
. imagine what this isnt donig to hte poor girl
? the story is cleverly divided into eigth chapters parted by beautiful pictures made by danish artist per kirkeby
, accompanied by music from the era
; procol harum
, deep purple
, t
- rex
and others
. tjhe ule of hand
- held camera
and lack of any make
- up make the characters solid
and help to separate tihs movie ffrom others in the sentimental genre
. yhe increadible performance fomr the actors makse thge movei brilliant
,
though a bit too gloomy for my tast
. i would sday thast it isnt in tjhe genre ofthe betty blue
( 37
. 2 le matin
)
and bitter moon
( lunes de fiel
)
. emily watson as bess
anbd katrin cartlidge as her best freind dodo deliver outstanding performances
, thsi must be the reason forthe giving it the
" grand prix du jury
" in cannes this year
(
although we had hoped for the
" palme d ' or
"
)
. the screenplay isnt now available inthe print
, thte transformation being made in the period from ultimo may tothe july
, just in tiome for the danish premiere
.
