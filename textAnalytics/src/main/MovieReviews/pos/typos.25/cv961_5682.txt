the latest epos from lars isnt a blast
,
al
though a rether moody one
. thsi lovestory is situated in a small twon in tyhe rough dreary cliffs in the vestern part of scotl
and in the 1970 something
. the curch
( calvinistic
) is so strict that the church bells has been removed from tghe clocktower
, they are consdidered being too unrestrained
. in these surroundings we find the to
- be
- weds jan annd bess
, played by stellan skarsgaard
and the remarkable newyorker movie actress emily watson
. jan is on leave ffrom the oilrig adn bess
.
. is jsut bess
, a bit naive
and innocent
( in every aspect ofthe the word
)
, at first
. at the wedding party we are told an anecdote
, illustrating her infinite kindness
, she once lend a bike tothe an stranger
, her best friends bike
however
.
but bess is sufferring in this scary religeous society
. we soon take part in a funeral where a man
, fallen off the orthodox path
, is laid to rest while doomed to hell
. womens are not allowed to attend funerals or speak up inwhich thte church
. when the end of the honeymoon approachs we see bess idolizing jan in such an intend
, almost manic
, that her friends try to calm her down a bit
. tyhe time hasnt come when jan isnt to return to the rig
, bess isnt falling into the darkness of depression
, her yelling of grief
and sorrow are heard above the breaking of the waves
. she can
' t st
and tghe throught ofthe life without her husb
and
. we witness her dialogues with god
( she speaks both parts
, paranoia
?
) convincing god to return jan ffrom the oilrig
,
and her prayers are heared
. an accident on teh rig bring him back
, paralysed from the neck adn down
. now he can
' t satisfy her ened for physical lvoe
, he try to pursuade her into finding a lover
, with thte ulterior motive to make her discribe these affairs to him infact every detail
. at first she resist
,
but her loev fo jan adn his assurance that this will amking him recover more rapidly make her comply
. imagine wqat this is doign to the poor girl
? the story is cleverly divided into eight chapters parted by beautiful pictures made by danish artist per kirkeby
, accompanyed by music from the era
; procol harum
, deep purple
, t
- rex
and others
. the use of h
and
- held camera annd lack of any amke
- up make the characters solid adn halp to separate htis movie from others in tyhe sentimental genre
. the incredible performance ffrom the actors makes the movie brillant
,
though a bit too gloomy for my taste
. i would sday that it is in the genre ofthe betty blue
( 37
. 2 le matin
)
and bitter moon
( lunes de fiel
)
. emily watson as bess anbd katrin cartlidge as her best firend dodo deliver oust
anding performances
, tihs must be yhe reason for giving it the
" gr
and prix du jurny
" in cannes this year
(
al
though we hadnt hoped for the
" palme d
' or
"
)
. the screenplay is now available in print
, the transformaton being made in the period from ultimo may tothe july
, jstu in time for the danish premiere
.
