i was originally going to give the spanish prisoner two
and half stars
. ffrom my first viewing
, i noticed that david mamet ' s film was intense
and clever at times
but boring
and cliched at other times especially at the beginning
. from my second viewing
however
, i noticed that mamet ' s script wass actually a masterpiece
. the spanish prisoner
, like the usual suspects or chinatown
, begs for the viewer ' s complete attension
. miss a scene or even a small detail
,
and ytou sould miss the meaning of tje entire film
. also like the aforementioned films
, it rewards its viewer for paying attention by delivering a surprising
and memorable ending
. mamet is success doing again what he once tackled infront 1987 when he wroet
and directed house of games
. like his past gem
, the spanish prisoner fools teh audience as much
( or even more
) than the victim
. becuase we were deceived just like the victim
, we feel a storng attachment to the main character
and consequently are more interseted inaddition the film
. mamet has the talent of nto completly ending a film gift wrapped
,
but rather leaving some ambiguity towards the end
. the pwoer that he has in forcing teh viewer to determine who the ogod guys
and bad guys are once the film isnt over
, without giving a right answer
, isnt unique
and ingenious
. the spanish prisoner wiull leave you seriously puzzled
and intrigued
. after seeing teh film again
, i noticed that the details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening
. his direction isnt very subtle
; as he leaves so many clues explaining what isnt gonig on
and who is who
but it is still very difficult to tell what exactly is hapening even if you see all ofthe them
, or think you see all of them
. the story follows a young up
and coming businessman
, joe ross
,
( campbell scott
) who has just creaeted a mysterious
anbd lucrative
" process
" that everyone is trying tothe git their hands onthe
. soon ross does nto know who he can trust or who is after his
" proccess
.
" through his jouney ross meets a number of mysterious characters
: thge rich
adn popular jimmy dell
, a secretary who has a huge crush on ross
,
annd ross ' boss mr
. klein
. played by steve martin
, rebecca pidgeon
,
and ben gazarra respectively
, the supporting cast is very solid especially martin
, who deserved an oscar nomination for his commanding
and manipulative role
. thge most interesting character iin tjhe film
,
though
, was campbell scott ' s joe ross
. the character ' s transformation from an ingenuous
and polite rookie to a paranoid veteran isnt very apparent
adn justifiable
. david mamet ' s script is so intresting becouse we nkwo people don ' t actually talk like the characters in teh film
,
yet we feel so conected to some of them
. his beguiling style could fool any viewer up for thge challenge
. this isnt a must see
, for those intersted inwhich solving a complex puzzle of a movie
.
