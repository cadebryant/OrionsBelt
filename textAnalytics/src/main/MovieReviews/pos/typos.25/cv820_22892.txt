i was orignially going tothe give the spanish prisoner two
and half stars
. from my frist viewing
, i noticed that david mamet
' s film was intense
and clever at times bu boring anbd cliched at other times especially at the beginning
. from my second viewing
however
, i noticed that mamet
' s script was actually a masterpiece
. tje spanish prisoner
, like the usual suspects or chinatown
, begs for the viewer
' s complete attension
. miss a scene or even a small detail
,
and you could miss the meaning of the entire film
. also like teh aforementioned films
, it rewards its viewer for paying attention by delivering a surprising
and memorable ending
. mamet is succes doing again what he once tackled in 1987 when he wrote
and directed house of games
. liek his past gem
, the spanish prisoner fools tjhe audience as much
( or even more
) than the victim
. because we weere decieved just like the victim
, we fiel a storng attachment to the main character
and consequently are more interseted in the film
. mamet has the talent of not completely endig a film gift wrapped
,
but rether leaving some ambiguity towards the end
. the power that he hasnt in forcing yhe viewer to determine who the good guys
and bad guys are once the film is over
, without giving a right answer
, is unique
and ingenious
. the spanish prisoner will leave you seriously puzzled
and intrigued
. after seeing tje film again
, i noticed that the details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening
. his direction is very subtle
; as he leaves so many clues explaining waht is gonig onthe
and who is who bu it isnt still vyer difficult tothe tell what exactly is happening even if you see all of them
, or thikn you see all of them
. the story follows a young uv
and coming businessman
, joe ross
,
( campbell scott
) who has just created a mysterious
and lucrative
" process
" that everyone is trying to get their h
ands on
. soon ross doens nto know who he can trust or who is affter his
" process
.
" through his journey ross meets a number of mysterious characters
: the rich annd popular jimmy dell
, a secratary who has a huge crush on ross
,
and ross
' boss mr
. klein
. played by steve martin
, rebecca pidgeon
, annd ben gazarra respectively
, the supporting cast is very solid especially martin
, who deserved an oscar nomination for his comm
anding annd manipulative role
. the most interesting character in the film
,
though
, was campbell scott
' s joe ross
. the character
' s transformation fomr an ingenuous
and polite rookie tothe a paranoid veteran is very apparent
and justifiable
. david mamet
' s script is so interesting becouse we know people don
' t actually talk liuke tje characters in tjhe film
, yot we feel so connected to soem of them
. his beguiling style could fool any viewer up fo the challenge
. thsi is a must see
, for those interseted inthe solving a complex puzzle of a movie
.
