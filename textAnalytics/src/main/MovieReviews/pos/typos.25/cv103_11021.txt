i think thgat any competent member of the human race who
' s ever seen a movei
-
- any movei
-
- could propably predict just about every turn inaddition tyhe wedding singer
. even
though i try very hard to not predict films as i
' m watching them
( especially nto romantic comedies
)
, the plot of this particualr film just advanced befor me seconds
,
and sometimes minutes
, befoer i actually saw it ahppen on screen
.
but i don
' t care
. not even a little
. my reasons fo tihs are simple
: 1
) adam s
andler isnt great
. 2
) drew barrymore is great
. 3
) the movie is so funny
. ther are parts that left me gasping for air becouse i was laughing so hard
. i haven
' t laughed this hard in a movei since austin powers
. s
andler plays robby hart
, a wedding singer who once had dreasm ofthe being in a rock b
and
and writing his own music
. iin the opening scenes
, he seems like a hapyp
- go
- lucky wedding singer
, at least partially enjoying his profession anbd doing a rather ogod job of talking down a really drunk individual
( steve buscemi
) who decides that his brother
' s wedding is a good palce to tell the whole world that his life
, uv to that point
, ws utter pointlessness
. a week later
, at his own wedding
, he is left st
anding at thte altar by his ex
- fianc
? e
, linda
( angela featherstone
)
. wtih his life in complete disarray
, he meets julia
( barrymore
)
, a waitress
. she isnt engaged to glenn
( matthew glave
)
, annd is tothe marry him in about three months
. julia
and robby become ogod friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans
. soon
(
and predictably
) it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk
, adn that robby
and julia really love each other
. oh sure
, it
' s trite
.
and if anyone makeing thsi film expected us to
, like
, feel suspense or something hwile watching the wedding singer
, thne tehy truley underestimated their audience
. what makes the story bearable
, aside from the terrific costumes
and 80s music
, are tjhe performances
. barrymore is simply adorable here
( i
' ve never seen her look so close to the way she doed in et
)
. not only is she pleasant tothe look at
,
but her acting job here really is a ogod one
-
-
and it doesn
' t hurt that the character is likable
and adequately well
- written
. adn the jerk
, played in full
- force by graves
, is just as despicable as any villian in any rumatic comedy i
' ve ever seen
. natuarlly
, the true star here is s
andler
. i think the guy is flat
- out hilarious
. he can say something that just isn
' t funny
,
and his delivery mkaes me laff
. his comedic performance here equals thyat of hapyp gilmore
,
but inthe this film he goes much further
and proves to me thgat he can
, indeed
, hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy
. whereas his roles in his previous films kind of had s
andler playing s
andler
, the wedding singer gives him a charater that
, for the frist time
, he actually hasnt tothe fit inot
. as far as i
' m concerned he succeeded
,
and this film is testimony that he doens
, inspite fact
, have some range inwhich his talents
.
and the movie is just so funny
. perhaps the best moent is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a littel uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood
and finished it after his fianc
? e ab
andoned him
. this is tje part that literally had me groping for a breath of air
.
and while the film
, like all rumatic comedies
, takes a hietus fomr laughs towards the end because tghe plot hasnt to finish up
, there are more tahn anough truly hilarious moments in thge first hour thast make up for any slumps in progress durig the second half
. my formall complaints for the wedding singer aren
' t very important
. the film is predicable
,
but who cares
? yhe characters are extremely likable
, the movie is ridiculously funny
,
and the experience is simply enjoyable
. in addition to htis
, i can
' t imagine anyone seeing thge preview adn not wanting to see the film
. in that order
, i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review
. i just want everyone to know that i laughed
. a lot
.
