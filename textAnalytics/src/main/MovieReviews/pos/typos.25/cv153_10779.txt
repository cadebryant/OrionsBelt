jack nicholson hasnt a funny way of playing cahracters with very fewd reedeming qualities
,
but whom you end up liking anyway
. inwhich as good as it gets
, the character in question is melvin udall
, a successful novelist wih obsessive
- compulsive desorder who seems bent onthe having as littel contact with peopel around him as possible
, exept when he feels like being a royal pain in the you
- knwo
- where
. he
' s mean
. i mean really mean
. the opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium
. every day
, melvin eats at the smae cafe
, sits at tghe same tbale
, anbd gets served by the smae waitress
. you can tell that this is his favorite palce to be a vicious nuisance
, when his waitress carol
( helen hunt
) tells him he can just go sit in another section
,
and all tjhe other waitresses just cringe
. one day
, melvin makse a comment tath goes tothe far
,
and carol
, genuinely hurt
, comes down on him like a ton of bricks
. at thyat point we find that she is not onyl the only person who can put up wih him as a matter of course
,
but is also the only person who can get to him
, too
. another person who often crosses melvin
' s sights is simon
( greg kinnear
)
, an artist who lives onthe melvin
' s floor
. aside from the fact tath he lives near the terror ofthe the city
, simon hasnt the added benefit of being gay
, making him a prime target
. simon
' s friend frank
( cuba gooding
, jr
.
)
, allso gay
, does not fare much better
. when simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment
, he is brutally beaten annd sent to teh hospital
,
and frank
, who has grown tired ofthe seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor
, intimidates melvin into watching after simon
' s dog while he convalesces
. tihs is the smae dog melvin had earlier shoved down tje garbage
. an intresting thing happens when melvin takes htis dog in
: melvin gets to liek hte dog
,
and the two develop an attachment which isnt tghe catalist tothe melvin
' s softening up to the world around him
. it doesn
' t happen overnight
,
but throughout thte film
, he bites his tongue here
, cares a little there
,
and most miraculously
, falls in love
. one of the best elements ofthe this film is watching melvin try tothe express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others
. he
' s traveling terra incognita here
,
and it shows
. good performances are turned inaddition by all principal players in this film
, especially by nicholson
and hunt
. they play well off of each other
and ahev a genuine chemistry whitch makes it a blessure tothe watch them on screen
. greg kinnear
, who isnt becoming known forthe his supporting film roles
, is allso very good at playing the vulnerable simon
. he gives a short monologue about what it means for him tothe be an artist
, anbd delivers it with such inspiration
and conviction that you actually git to fiel some of what he fiels
. cuba gooding jr
. performs with a hyped
- uv level of energy whcih contrasts nicely with thta of kinnear
,
and comes thru with a near constatn comic performance
. the screenplay
, by mark
andrus adn james l
. brooks
, is clever
, touching
,
and funny
. the best part about it
,
however
, is that it is filled with cahracters we care baout because htey are actually intresting
. melvin is a man we can
' t quite figure outloud
,
but whose mannerisms
and quirky qualities capture our attension
. carol isnt a working woman living with her mother
, trying tothe take care of a child wtih a debilitating respiratory problem
. simon is a man who is a succes in his circle ofthe peers
,
but who is still not accepted by much of society
. combined with the talent ofthe the actors
, these characters make tje film
. the noe noticeable areal where the film is lacking
,
however
, isnt the absence of cuba gooding
, jr
. through teh second half
. his character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary
,
but the film ends before his return
, leaving his relationship with simon
and melvin unresolved
. i would have liked to have seen omre of his carachter infront general
, in addition to a part in the film
' s conclusion
. there
' s oen acotr
, who will probably not be recognized by any awards
,
but who contri
butes greatly to many of hte movei
' s best scenes
and who deserves mention
. this isnt that little dog
. he plays such a pivotal role to melvin
' s charachter devolopement
, atually serves to forward the plot
,
and has smoe absolutely scene
- stealing moments
, thyat it isnt hard to believe he is simply an animal
. award or noone
,
however
, wehn even hte dog puts in a good performance
, you know you
' ve got an oust
anding movei
.
