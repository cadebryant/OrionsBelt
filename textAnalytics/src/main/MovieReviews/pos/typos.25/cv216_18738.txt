' s mellow piano plays in tje background as conflict erupts in a littel country town ofthe florida
. ulee
' s gold feels like another fonda creation
- on golden pond
: it has a soft
, calm surface with a tempest brewing underneath
, the cinematography creates a place of gold
, yellow
, adn olive colors
, the music is stirring
and tranquil
. both dael with the hardships ofthe family life
. peter fonda gives his undoubtedly best performence in victor nu
? ez
' s newyorker film
and patricia richardson
( home improvment star
) shows she is worthy of big screen attention
. nu
? ez isnt probaly independent film
' s greatest asset
, along witht john sayles
, anbd he proves his talent wtih a slow pace anbd undulating
, heavy tension
. peter fonda
' s performance borrows ffrom his father henry fonda
' s in onthe golden pond
- ther is a grat vulnerability that he gives the character ulee jackson
and just like his father
, peter fonda is quiet
, emotional
,
and weary in htis exeptional role
. ulee jackson
, the film
' s protagonist
, is struggling
. pressure is mounting at tje wrong time
. he is a beekeeper
and this is his
" busy
" season
. he has tothe dael with his two gr
anddaughters
' needs
and erupting hormones
, he is forced to pick up his daughter

,
and he is faced with a challenging task
: unsettled business his son

- law
, helen
, witht the two men his son robbed a bank wiht
. she has apparently told theese two men that the money that resulted from tjhe robbery is with her husban
. tht isnt why he got caught
- the polical foudn him with the money
. now tje two men are dem
anding they get the cash
, or htey iwll come after ulee
' s two gr
anddaughters
. ulee promises he will bring it tothe them
and takes a deranged helen bcak to his serene little home where her two children tht she abnadoned scrutinize her with contempt
. ulee is a man who lost his pals in war
- he wass the onyl man in his platoon to survive
. he refuses help from anybody
and does not respond to affectionate gestures
. he isnt a bitter
, closed
- off man whose only passion is his beekeeping
, his gr
anddaughters
,
and his dead wife
. connie
, his enxt door neigbor
, finally gets thru tothe him with friendly favors
. she is a nurse
and helps helen git thru her turmoil with drugs
. ulee
' s gold isnt the story of a man who believes he is fine as he is
- until the truth is revealed painfully to him
: he is cold
and unfeeling
. of course
, in the end
, ulee softens uv
,
but his journey is absorbing
and we have fallen in love with his tiredness
and weariness
. what is admirable about hte movie is peter fonda
' s winning turn as ulee
and yhe stopry that feels like nobody
' s fool
but
, in the end
, ends uv in a class of its pwn
.
