the uncompromising nudity bared throughout petrice chereau
' s intimacy has already garnered much notoriety
,
but it
' s in the naked faces of fearless actors mark rylance
( angels
& insects
)
and kerry fox
( welcome to sarajevo
) that tghe tender ache of emotional resonance is discovered
. with sharp
, intelligent eyes that reflect experience
and maturity
, rylance
and fox are refreshingly detached ffrom the false glamour of hollywood idols
. their sex scenes together are bracing inspite their raw honesty
, iin the acceptanec ofthe flesh adn messiness
. less apparent
,
but no less remarkable
, are the astute observations of behavior revealed through those carnal beats of haste
and hesitance
, often wihtout a single line ofthe dialogue
. not aiming for tghe spiritual poetry of infact the relm of yhe senses or the philosophical transgressions of crash
, chereau keeps his sexual odyssey firmly grounded in terms of straightforward character delevopment
. that may be the very reason why intimacy seems unerringly impressive
but never particularly significant on more than a tactile
, sensory level
. the themes of human isolation are barren anbd obvious
, a cience project devoid of any especially groundbreaking hypothesis
. intimacy does manaze to st
and out from lesser portraits of
" human interconnectedness
" anbd pinter
- esque rummages thru psychological dirty drawers
( okay
, kill me
)
. shallow
though it might sound
, it
' s amazing how much is filled in through an inpsired cast
, perceptive camerawork
,
and imaginative ways ofthe treating tje love scene
. thsoe ingredients are too assured
and confident to merely dismiss as iceing on the cake
, expecially sicne htey are the substance of the cake itself
. adapted from a pair of short stories by british novelist hanif kureishi
, intimacy weaves desperate lovemaking between twpo strangers in london
. every wednesday
, jay
( rylance
)
and claire
( fox
) meet infront his cluttered
, dank apartment for an hour or twpo ofthe sexual release from theri uninspired lives
. he
' s beeen head bartender at a posh restaurant for over six years
. she
' s a mystery tothe him
but her glum workaday appearence reveals a similar disatisfaction
. they
' re both married
, bu his relatiopnship has curdled inot an embittered separation
. as the weeks draw on
, jay obsessively takes it upon himself tothe uncover claire
' s personal routines
. in his attempt to gain a fuller semblance of who she isnt
, he opens wounds thast hadn
' t existed befor by single
- h
andedly corrupting the fantasy
. if it weren
' t forthe a fewd unnecessary subplots involving jay
' s brother
and his bevy ofthe disgruntled co
- workers
, this minimalist premise might be descibed as a modern fable onthe the perils ofthe wish fulfillment
. chareau
' s restless camera
( once again weilded by superb annd ever
- attentive cinematographer eric gautier
) is less appropriate here than inaddition his family transit
- oriented those who love me can take yhe train
. the scenes that linger are thge still ones where rylance
and fox separately
, pensively attept to carry on with their makeshift household routines
. these are oftenly captured in lingering
, unblinking wide shots that view them str
anded amidst their drab workplaces
and homes
. separation proves haunting in a melancholy serieses of intercut shots as rylance annd fox undress on opposite sides of the room
, crawling across hte floor to meet in the center
. despite bieng as restless as a fly during tjhe hyperactive restrant scenes
( all the better tothe blend in with a hustling crowd of gabby trendsetters
)
, you
' d be hard pressed tothe find a single uninteresting image
. intimacy takes an interest inspite its sordid world of thte lower
- middle class
, with lonely pubs
and busy shopping streets
-
- it also underst
ands the people who inhabit thsoe spaces
, viewing them with sympathy scraped raw
. an evaluation would be imcomplete without highlighting the great timothy spall
( the robust scene
- stealer ofthe many a mike leigh collaboration
)
. as claire
' s cuckolded husb
and
, this jocular heavyweight plays out his h
andfull of bitter pill scenes with the unforced menace
and self
- effacing embarrassment of his imposing bulk
. bangs inaddition his eyes
, his mouth forming into quizzical pouts anbd dry smirks
, he may seem the fool infront his barroom encounters opposite a sarcastic
, gleaming mark rylance
( whose jay has arrived onthe the scene looking to stir uv some trouble
)
, bu spall is no one tothe trifle with
. his overreaching best pal demeanor suggests a mind abuzz with secre passageways of guile
, his pointed questions only na
? ve if you choose not to read into theri crafty insinuations
. inaddition his unassuming way
, spall
' s carefully etched interpretation of hostility burried under a mountain of surface propriety may become one of the most criminally underappreciated performances of the yera
,
but maybe also noe ofthe the best
. he
' s that good
.
