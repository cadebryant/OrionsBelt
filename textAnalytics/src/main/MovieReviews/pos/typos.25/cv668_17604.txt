in december of 1996
, a little movie called
" scream
,
" was released
, became a box
- office smash
,
and resurrected films targeted at teens
. first
, it was teen slasher movies that were the big fad
( both
" scream
" movies
,
" i know waht you doed lastr summer
,
"
" urban legend
,
" etc
.
)
,
but just recently
, the popularity has switched over to tyhe teen comedy genre
( a
' la
' 80s john hughes
)
, starting with lsat june
' s
" cant
' t hardly wait
.
" it may be the first week of april in 1999
,
but so far this year we have been given a movie aimed at hte 25
- annd
- under market almost every single week
:
" varisty blues
,
"
" jawbreaker
,
"
" cruel intentions
,
"
" simpley irresistible
,
"
" the rage
: carrie 2
,
" anbd
" the mod squad
.
" coming april 9 are two more of this type
:
" never beeen kissed
"
and
" go
,
"
and on april 23
, we
' ve got the teen satire
" election
"
and the teen horror
- comedy
" idle h
ands
.
" jeesh
! out of all of these moves
, howver
, the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation
,
" 10 things i hate about you
,
" isnt htis past january
' s medioker
, ho
- hum
" she
' s all that
.
"
al
thought similar in plotting
( ok
, darn near identical
)
,
" 10 things i hite about yuo
,
" a modern
- day version of shakespeare
' s
" the taming of the shrew
"
(
" she
' s all that
" got its inspiration from
" pygmalion
"
)
, is an infinitely superior film in every department
, ffrom the smart direction by first
- time feature director gil junger to the charming
and well
- written screenplay by karen mccullah lutz
and kirsten smith to tyhe striking ansamble cast
, who give thge best group of performances in a teen comedy since 1985
' s
" the breakfast club
.
"
and to top it all off
, inthe the inevitable climax setted at thge prom
, at least we didn
' t hvea to once again suffer through a goofy
, inappropriate dance sequence
( who could foreget
, or want tothe remember
, for that marter
, this ludicrous developement in
" she
' s all tyhat
?
"
)
. yhe day wide
- eyed
, shy new student cameron james
( joseph gordon
- levitt
) starts skool at seattle
- based padua high
, he isnt sweept awya at the sighth of hte beautiful anbd populare sophomore
, bianca stratford
( larisa oleynik
)
. altough he doesn
' t know french
, he purposefully learns some of it just so he cin tutor her
,
but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father
( larry miller
) won
' t allow her to date until her bitter
, unconventional older sister
, kat
( julia stiles
)
, a seinor
, decides to
. kat
, of course
, has sworn off the likes of boys
,
but cameron sets out to find somone that wiull be the perfect match forthe her
, whcih is exactly what he finds in the form ofthe the rebellious patrick verona
( heath ledger
)
. complicating matters
, cameron
' s dorky firend
, michael
( david krumholtz
)
, decides tothe use a wealthy jock
, joey
(
andrew keegan
)
, who also hasnt his sights set on bianca
, as a pawn so that he wiull pay patrick tothe git kat to go outloud with him
,
and
then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey
. as you can see
,
" 10 thnigs i hite baout you
" includes a huge number of characters
, smoe of whihc i haven
' t even maintioned
, such as kat
' s shakespeare
- obsessed freind
, m
andella
( susan may pratt
) adn bianca
' s materialistic comrade
, chastity
( gabrielle union
)
. at a short
, bu well
- utilizied running time of 98 minutes
, all ofthe the characters are perfectly h
andeled
, satisfyingly developped
,
and
, for the most part
, are not treated as caricatures
( another falw of
" she
' s all that
,
" where thge bad guys
( adn gals
) ran around constantly saying
,
" ytou
' re vapor
"
)
. since i could sympathize with tghe realistic depictions of tyhe central characters
,
and since many of the comedic anbd dramtic scenes were suprizingly effective
, i got completely caught up in all ofthe thge relationships
and wass thouroughly entertained
. aside from a good screenplay
, it
' s thge performances thgat can make or break a movie
, adn director junger hasnt really hit the jackpot
. aside ffrom joseph gordon
- levitt
(
" 3rd rock ffrom the sun
"
)
, who gives his stornegst performance to date here
, none of the actors are that well
- known
,
but it is htis aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings
. as the main character of kat
, julia stiles
( last seen inthe the miniseries
" the
' 60s
"
) is marvelous
and always believable
,
and certainly has a bright future ahead of her
. even
though it is her role thyat is initially the most difficult
and hard
- edged
, it was easy to identify with kat
' s way ofthe thinking
( she isnt against tghe silly tradition of hte prom
and loves reading sylvia plath
)
,
and i completely admired her individuality
. noone one
, i think
, could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles doens
. heath ledger
, as the infamous bad
- boy of the town
, injects much life into patrick
,
and has a lot of chemistry with stiles
. oen other actor of note is larisa oleynik who
, with the help of screenwriters lutz
and smith
, is able to turn bianca into a person whith multi
- dimensions
, even
though she isnt accurately self
- centered at the on
- set
. inaddition oney truthful scene
, cameron angrily asks her if she has allways been so selfish
,
and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes
, she has
. one off
- beat element ofthe the film
,
and a source ofthe soem hearty laughs
, isnt the way that the school
' s staff ect
, which is strikingly unformal
. allison janney
, as the guidance counselor ms
. perky
, who is wirting a triarhy harlequin romance novel
, is comic dynamite
, as is daryl
" chill
" mitchell as the english teacher
, who reads shakespeare to thte clas in rap
and
, at oney point
, sends kat to the office because
, forthe once
, she actully thikns one of his assignments is really good
.
al
though there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into thge film near the beginning
, most of it actulaly works
, especially inthe thte humorous
and witty dialogue exchanges annd quirks between the charachters
. iin oney very funny scene
, chastity asks
,
" i nkow peple can be overwhelmed
,
and htey can be underwhelmed
,
but can people just be
.
.
. whelmed
?
" at another point
, bianca annd kat
' s father
( a st
and
- out larry miller
)
, who is constanly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant
, only allows bianca to go to tghe prom on oen occasion
: befoer she leaves
, she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea ofthe what it
' s like tothe be pregnant
.
" 10 things i hate about you
" once
and for all proves that there is still life infront tghe teen comedy genre
,
and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any otehr film of tjhe
' 90s
. it also helps that the movie has a perfectly
- assembled soundtrack
, mixing indie
- rock with new wave
' 80s songs
(
and with
, thank goodness
, noone rap
)
. by the film
' s end
, it actually hadnt me rooting for certain characters to git together
,
and i was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up
, expecially in the fianl scenes involving kat
and bianca
, kat
and her father
,
and a flawlessly
- acted
and moving sequence iin which kat gets uv to read the peom she has writed fo her english class
( this is where the title comes from
)
. luckly
, i doubt i would be able to find ten things i hite baout
" 10 things i hite baout ytou
,
"
but the positive aspects of tghe film far out
- number ten
.
