" being john malkovich
" is tyhe tipe of film we need to see more
. today
' s films are eather blockbusters that entertain us with tiresome formulas
, or those that have similar themes
. malkovich falls under none of these catagories
,
and it
' s quite refreshing to see taht occur
. this strangely provoking story
, is actually somewhat underst
andable
. john cusack plays a puppeteer trying to amking it to the big time
. his wife
( cameron diaz
) supports the both of them by working at a petstore
, which explains the obscure pets they keep in theri apartment
. when cusack finally realizes he needs to get a job
, he finds an ad fo a filing clerk
. wehn he reaches the building
, he arrives at a 7 1
/ 2 floor
. it
' s there that he discovers a secret portal that leads to bieng john malkovich fo 15 mintues at a time
. meanwhile
, cusack meets a business partner
( catherine keener
)
, infront which he falls madly in love with her
. the onyl problem is
, she has no interest in him whta so ever
. the wohle portal thing
, isn
' t just a toy
, in fact
, it becomes cusack
' s dream
. bieng inside malkovich
' s mind
, gave him the opportunity tothe basically control mlakovich
, liuke a puppet
,
and tothe fullfill his fantasies
. i don
' t want to give away too much
, bu cusack becomes too attached wiht his discovery
. in my oppinion
, this diea is absolutely brilliant
. it
' s really qutie scary to think taht somone could become yuo
, control you
, be you
. it makes you wonder why we act like we do
,
and why sometimes we blurt out things or ect out something out of the blue
. even if the script is super sharp
, i cxan
' t halp bu find tje endig displeasing
. it could have lead up to something moreso
, or at least an amusing conclusion
. it tried to explain a mythology baout the portals
, thta made it seem rushed
. otehr than that
, i hadnt a very enjoyable tiome
. the acting was quite delightful as well
. john cusack has fianlly been given a chance tothe proove his ablity
,
and he does it well
. he
' s by far the most underated actor due to a lack of popularity
, bu i
' m hoping that iwll change
. cameron diaz was her usual charming self
,
al
though i felt thta part was wrong forthe her
,
but she pulled it off
. john malkovich hismelf continues to creep out people with his eerie facial expressions anbd tone of voice
. who else
' s mind would be better to explore
? tghe director
, spike jonze
, who appeared in last month
' s three kings really catches my attention wtih htis project
. i knew he was bizzare
,
but not to this extreme
. he too is likely too receive media attension
.
" being john malkovich
" isn
' t an excellent film
,
but it is definitly intertaining
and will eaisly become a cult favorite
. whta
' s even better is the film
' s puzzling message
.
.
. am i nick lyons
?
