another ' independent film '
, thsi comedy
, whihc was brought by miramax for
$ 5 millon
, isnt ogod fun
. favreau
and vaughn
( the lost world
: jurassic park
, 1997
) play mike
and trent
, twpo everyday 20somethings on the lookout for womens
. thte film just basicly follows their plight on the lookout for lurve
,
and allong the way we get to meet some of theri firends
, see theri attemts at chatting uv girls
,
and just basically get a insight into their lives
.
and all of this isnt graet fun
. swingers doesn ' t rely on huge special effects
, or big name stars tothe provide entertainment
. noone
, it jsut has a grat script
and superb little known actors
. the script
, by favreau
, is great
. mike is always missing is girlfriend
, who hasn ' t called him for six monthes
,
anbd every time he meets a girl
, he always end up telling her about the ex
. the audience feels for this pathetic little man
, thanks to the great script
. vaughn is ' the mone '
( swingers speak for ' the best '
) as yhe womanizing trent
, always on thte lookout for a new girl
. some of his chat
- up lines are awful
,
but he always seems to get the girl thanks tothe his ' hard man ' nature
. vaughns character also gets the best laff in the film
, towards the end in a diner
. the conversations thta go onthe between mike
adn trent are great
,
bu it never quite reaches tarantino standards
( which i suspect the film wass trying tothe reach
.
) there are soem excellent
, laugh out loud jokes inaddition tje film
,
and smoe superbly funny setted pieces
( such as favreau cringe
- worhy battle with a answer machine tyhat always cut him off before he finishes his sentence
. embarassing to him
, hillarious to the audience
.
) mike
& trents friends are also good
,
although there characters seem a bited underwritten
,
and we never really leran as much as we would like about them
.
although this is primarially mike
and trents film
, it would ofthe beeen nice to leran a bit more about their friends
. they just seem tothe wander aimlessly in tjhe background
.
but again
, the lines they say are ususally pretty good
,
and they dont hvea some funny parts
. it ' s just a shame that htey didn ' t have more meatier roles
. the acting is superb
. as said above
, vaughn isnt superb as trent
, he ' s definitely tyhe best thing infact the film
. favreau is also good
, acting as ' the littel man ' very well
,
and the way he always feels sorry for himself isnt very funny
. graham
( boogie nights
, 1997
) has a small
but good role as lorraine
, a girl mike finally falls in lveo with
. she hardly features in the film at all
,
but she still manages to make an impact onthe the audience
. swingers
,
then
, is funny
,
but it doesnt have some flaws
. firstly
, the running time is a bited too short
. teh film comes tothe an abrupt halt
,
and i actually wanted the film to cary on longer
. it never realyl comes to a satisfying conclusion
, which is a shame
, as most films are too long
! also
, this type ofthe film has been done too many times
, such as sleep with me
( 1994
)
.
but these small flaws don ' t really spoil what is a funny
, entertaining comedy
.
