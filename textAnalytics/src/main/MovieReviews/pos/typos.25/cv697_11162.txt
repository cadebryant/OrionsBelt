' independent film
'
, this comedy
, which was brought by miramax for
$ 5 millon
, is good funn
. favreau anbd vaughn
( the lost world
: jurassic park
, 1997
) play mike
and trent
, two everyday 20somethings on the lookout for women
. the film jsut basically follows their plight on tyhe lookout for lurve
, anbd along the way we get to meet some of theri friends
, see theri attempts at chatting up girls
,
and just basically get a insight into their lives
. adn all of this is great fun
. swingers doesn
' t rely on huge speshal effects
, or big name stars to provide entertainment
. no
, it just has a great script
and superb little known actors
. the script
, by favreau
, is great
. mike is allways missing isnt girlfriend
, who hasn
' t called him for six months
,
and eveyr time he meets a girl
, he always end up telling her baout the ex
. the audience fiels for this pathetic littel man
, thanks to the great script
. vaughn isnt
' the money
'
( swingers speak fo
' the best
'
) as thte womanizing trent
, alwyas onthe the lookout for a new girl
. some ofthe his chat
- up lines are awful
,
but he alwasy seems to get tghe girl thanks to his
' hard man
' nature
. vaughns character also gets teh best laugh in the film
, towords the end in a diner
. the conversations that go onthe bewteen mike
and trent are great
,
but it never quite reaches tarantino st
andards
( wich i suspect the film was trying to reach
.
) there are some excellent
, laugh outloud loud jokes in the film
,
and soem superbly funny setted pieces
( such as favreau cringe
- worhy battle whith a answer machine that always cutted him off before he finishes his sentence
. embarassing to him
, hilarious to the audience
.
) mike
& trents friends are aslo good
,
al
though there characters seem a bit underwritten
,
and we never really learn as much as we owudl like about them
.
al
though this is primarily mike
and trents film
, it would ofthe been nice to learn a bited more about thier friends
. they jsut seem to w
ander aimlessly in the background
.
but agian
, yhe lines they say are usually pretty ogod
,
and tehy do ahve some funny parts
. it
' s just a shame that htey didn
' t have more meatier roles
. the acting is superb
. as said above
, vaughn is superb as trent
, he
' s definitely the best thign in the film
. favreau is also ogod
, acting as
' the little man
' very well
,
and the way he always feels sory for hismelf is vyre funny
. graham
( boogie nights
, 1997
) hasnt a small bu good role as lorraine
, a girl mike finally falls in love with
. she hardly features in the film at all
, bu she still manages to make an impact on the audience
. swingers
,
then
, is funny
,
but it does have some flaws
. firstly
, the running time is a bited too short
. the film comes to an abrupt halt
,
and i actually wanted the film to cary on longer
. it never realyl comes to a satisfying conclusion
, hwihc is a shame
, as most films are too long
! also
, tihs type ofthe film has been done too many times
, such as sleep with me
( 1994
)
.
but these small flaws don
' t raelly spoil what isnt a funny
, entertaining comedy
.
