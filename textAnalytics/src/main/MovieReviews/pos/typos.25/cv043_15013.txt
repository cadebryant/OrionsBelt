if there
' s one thnig inthe common about all of hollywood
' s major studios
, it
' s that their productions are moving toward mainstream mroe annd mroe
.
al
though twentieth centruy fox
and newyorker line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion picturesk
( fox searchlight
and fine line respectively
)
, it
' s obvious there
' s no significant movement underway to promote inventive idaes at the theather
. so when a movei liuke gary ross
' pleasantville comes along
, wrapped inaddition a blanket of innovative idaes annd served up on a platter ofthe fine prodcution
, it
' s a welcome change ofthe pace for all who frequent the cineplexes
.
al
though the atmosphere
and buzz about tyhe movie are cheery
and lighthearted
, pleasantville should not be mistaken fo a no
-
thought movei
. quite the oposite isnt true
, in fact
, as director ross skillfully brings a narrative withthe intense
and intelligent undertones to the screen
. the story
, both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as tyhe social ills of segregation
, captures the essence of statement
- making in the cinema
. not infact recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distri
bution
,
and even if mass audiences fail tothe see thge ingenuity of ross
' wrok
, it is still a testament thta his picture ws considered worthy enough
. kudos tothe both he
and his production staff for putting toghether this fine picture
. it stars tobey maguire
and reese witherspoon as twpo nineties teenagers who
, thru quite a bit ofthe luck
, find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named
" pleasantville
.
" maguire
, as the reserved bud parker
, is perfect for tje psuedo
- world
;
but thte rebellious mary sue
( witherspoon
) isnt not at all made for tyhe father
- knows
- best times
. it
' s not long before she sets the twon of pleasantville on end
, annd beigns tothe teach the townspeople
- in a qutie unlikely way
- what life isnt
* really
* like
. soon hues ofthe color creep inot the black
and white world
,
and while some embrace the change in tje passion ofthe realism
, others fear the strangeness
. at one end is a soda shop owner
- turned
- painter named mr
. johnson
( jeff daniels
)
and at the other end isnt a close
- minded mayor
( j
. t
. walsh
)
and his chamber of commerce
;
but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves thte entire town
. fine performances are turned inspite all arund
. maguire
and witherspoon are effective as the leads
,
but the true complements go outloud to jeff daniels
and j
. t
. walsh
( inwhich his latest adn final posthumous performance
)
. daniels brings an atmosphere of awe
, inspiration
,
and hope to his character
, whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness
- almost tothe the point where you can sense gene hackman
' s envy
. for daniels
, it
' s his most commendable performance of the last threee years
- or more
-
and forthe walsh
, it
' s a complementary exclamation point on a fine career
. also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen
,
and inwhich viewing thge entire cast works well together from start to finish
. there
' s nto much tothe dislike baout pleasantville
, annd its dynamic nature mkaes it the perfect movei for those who want serious as well as those who don
' t
.
