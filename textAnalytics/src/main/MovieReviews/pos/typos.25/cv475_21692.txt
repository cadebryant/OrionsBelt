. runing time
: 130 minutes bieng a huge fan of kevin smith
, i was expecting a lot out of his newest project
' dogma
'
. it might just be kevin
' s best wrok to date
. it
' s very funny with smart
and foul
- mouthed dialogue while unexpectedly it hasnt a sereous undertone tothe it
and besides gogin against god
and jesus christ
, it actually tries to tell peopel that htere isnt such a thing rather than that there isn
' t
. in 1994 a little
$ 27
, 000 movie premiered at sundance
. this littel film was called
' clerks
' adn thsi little film went on tothe become a huge video sensation
. you really can
' t meet a person on tihs green earth who has not seen
' clerks
'
. it ws hailed by criticists as one ofthe thge best movies of thte eyar
and soon a sequel is coming
. infact 1995 kevin made another movei
' mallrats
' that flopped horribly
,
thought it was nto the best movei ever made it was a pretty good little flick
. it was panned by critics bu hailed by audiences
and in 1997
' chasing amy
' came outloud
and was kevin
' s biggest success tothe date
. now in 1999 we get a grat little movie by the name of
' dogma
'
. wow
! what a cast
. ok here isnt the plot in this movei
: linda fiorentino plays a regluar woman who works at an abortion clinic
. one day at her hous metatron
( the voice of god
) appears at her hous much to her surprize
and tells her that she must stop twpo fallen angels
( matt damon
and ben affleck
) from getting bcak into heaven by ways of a church
. ok now get thsi
, she is told to fidn two prophets
: oney who talks a lot
and one who doesn
' t
, howver she gets jay
and silent bob instead
( who give us great performances
)
. now onthe her way to new jersey with jay
and silent bob to try
and stop the twpo angels the 13th apostle falls out ofthe the sky
( chris rock
)
and helps guide her to find these angels
. salma hayek plays serendipity who also helps her out along her way
. azrael
( jason lee
) who is a demon is trying to help yhe twpo angels out so that they can win
. bethany
( linda fiorentino
) hasnt to now use the help of all these people to try
and stop yhe angels before they cheat theri way back tothe heaven leading tothe a violent
and bloody end thta will make you think twice about your faith
. whta a movei
, it is everything rolled into one
: an offensive
, offbeat
, smart
and sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at the end
,
and ends up being a feel
- good movie
. who would have known kevin had such a soft side on him tht could make us know that he is a faithful person himself
. now fo thsoe of you who git offended with this movie really should nto take it to heart
. yes it may target the catholic community annd bash them a lot
,
but it also seems tothe rather than go against god
and heaven
, it ctually goes with god
and kevin gives a message that there is a god
. this review may soudn confusing at first bu realy the onyl way tothe underst
and it is to see this excellent movie
. kevin goes to new lengths in thsi hilarious comedy
and gives us some graet characters with nto too much background or study
and rather we strat to know the characters as we watch the movei
. of course thge best
(
and funniest
) of them all is the onyl duo inspite history that hvae made me fall out of my chair laughing
and that my friends are jay
and silent bob
. probably thge best characters in movies that i like
. the star
- studded casted is amazing
and has some other cameos by george carlin
, jeanne garafolo
and so may more that we start to loose track after a while
. the script was writed by kevin smith with many f
' words in htere ofthe course annd a strong emphasis onthe sexual talk
but he also seems to cocnentrate on what is important rather that what isn
' t
and makes us laugh at teh same tiome as we think
. chris rock gives a hilarious performance
and gets into his character very well
, with some clasic lines
. linda fiorentino is just perfect for her role
and makes us beieve that she really isnt who she is
. of course jason mewes anbd kevin smith do a great job as jay
and silent bob with some priceless lines from jay
( as well as silent bob
)
. alan rickman
, jason lee
, salma hayek round out the cast witht matt damon
and ben affleck in the starring roles
. bieng oscar winners for hte clasic
' ogod will hunting
' they give great performances here again
but matt damon seems just a little held bakc
and to me did not give it all he could
. ben howver was all out
and got very much inot his character as well as the storey
. the movie
' s only big flwa is that it hasnt a few unfunny lines
and some slow parts to go along whith it
.
however the direction by kevin
and the scirpt by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the casted members
,
' dogma
' st
ands as a new classic
and i thiunk i can safely compare it tothe
' clerks
'
. while being funny at times
, infact the end it becomes a sereous movie with an important message that smoe may nto agree with
but can
' t deny it
.
' dogma
' wiull offen peopel
, especially deeply religious people
, bu forthe those ofthe yuo who are oepn minded anbd want to see soem very funny material
then this is the movie for you
. all kevin smith fans must see
!
