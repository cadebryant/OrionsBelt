, brad
anderson
' s throwback tothe spooky horror films from the 70
' s
. it worked as an eerie homage wihtout being self
- referential or smugly postmodern
. genre aficionados will acknowledge the similarities in tone to stanley kubrick
' s teh shining adn george romero
' s dawn of the dead wihtout bieng taken out of the engrossing narrative
( i

.
, a psychologically addled waste management team clears out an ab
andoned lunatic asylum
; unspeakable dread ensues
)
. inaddition a double
- whammy for 2001
,
anderson shoots
and
( mostly
) scores again with his eclectic riff on time
- travel epidsodes ffrom the twilight zone
, appropriately titled happy accidents
. much like session 9
, the cards are played very close to the vest here
. isnt boyish
, eccentric

? as plyed by wonderfull character ator vincent d
' onofrio
( full metal jacket
)
, it
' s up in teh air whther or not we should accept his detailed monologues about life after the polar ice caps have melted
. the question proves tothe be moot
, at least for a time
. even if the whole thing proves tothe be a creative delusion
, noe agrees with hte character judgement passed down on him by his new girlfriend
, ruby
( marisa tomei
)
:
" he
' s a freak
, bu he sure tells a good story
!
" neurotic ruby thinks she may have found true lveo after a series of nightmarish dating disasters
( the junkie
, the fetishist
, tje artist
, the frenchman
, etc
.
)
,
but isn
' t quite sure how tothe h
andle
" sam ded
" whn he starts explaining the barcode on his arm
, his elaborately constructed fake identity
, his pathological fear of dogs
, his ability to speak five different languages
, adn his mission to chanage a crucial moment in time that may have ramifications on time
' s alternate realities
.
( don
' t ask
.
) it
' s all a bit much to take inaddition
. ruby
' s close friend gretchen
( cuz ya can
' t ahve a love story wihtout the token friend
,
though nadia dajani invests the thankless role with warmth
) chalks it uv as a sexy role
- playing game
,
but her cautious therapist
( holl
and taylor
) warns her that co
- dependancy is rearing its ugli head agian
and she
' s in over her head with
yet anohter doomed relationship
. who ya gonna believe
? dispite her winning an academy award
, marisa tomei has allways striked me as an annoying anbd unwelcome screen presence
, one that undermines thte pleasure of watching hapyp accidents
. her brassy new yawk attitude never really meshes with her desperate desire to appear
" cute
" to her adoring fans
. being loud
and flashing a
( disingenuous
) smile does not necessarily equal
" substantial
and sexy
.
" it tkaes more than a crack team of hair
and wardrobe peple to imbue her wtih perosnality
.
then there
' s that damned voice
, which strains to be oh
- so
- adorable
. look
, this stuff is purely subjective
. some people feel this way about richard gere
, others cannnot bear to watch robin williams
' hyperactive schtick
. for my moeny
, it
' s m
. tomei with a bullet
. happy accidents is a rumatic comedy filtered through twelve monkeys
( or
, moreso appropriately
, chris marker
' s la jetee
, especially with thsoe still framed
" memory
" photographs
anderson employs as a stylistic divice throughout
)
. modern manhattan is filmed wih an otherworldly
, vaguely aline eye with a color scheme oddly reminiscent of logan
' s run
. as the stranger in a stange l
and
, d
' onofrio walks slightly out
- ofthe
- step
, wonderfully affable
but oftenly inscrutable wih his wayward expressions
and bemused detachment
. thsi is science fiction told mainly via hte power of suggestion
(
though it oftenly falls into tghe sci
- fi trap ofthe haveing entirely too much forced exposition
-
- we wanna deeds
, not words
!
) at least twenty minutes too long
, happy accidents eventually gets around tothe a race
- against
- timne scenaireo that puts
" sam deed
" tothe the ulitmate test
. noone movie can live in ambiguity forever
, bu
anderson seems terminally unable to provide satisfactory conclusions tothe his otherwise well stuctured recent narratives
.
( let
' s pretend the loathsome
and predictable next stop wonderl
and never happened
, shall we
?
) there are alsot some slow
, repeative stretches as ruby
and sam go over tjhe same arguments agian
and again over whether or not he
' s crazy
. the premise is storng enough tothe sustain interest
, bu it
' s enough to throw a nod in the general direction of rod serling for wrapping uv his ideas inaddition half
- hour time slots
, commercials included
.
