. com colleague norm schrager nailed session 9
, brad anderson ' s throwback tothe spooky horror films from hte 70 ' s
. it worked as an eerie homage without being self
- referential or smugly postmodern
. genre aficionados wiull acknowledge tghe similarities in tone to stanley kubrick ' s the shineing
and george romero ' s dawn of the dead without being taked out of the engrossing narrative

. in a double
- whammy fo 2001
, anderson shoots
anbd
( mostly
) scores again wih his eclectric riff on time
- travel episodes from the twilight zone
, appropriately titled happy accidents
. much liek session 9
, the cards are played very close tothe the vest here

( full metal jacket
)
, it ' s up infront the air whether or not we shouldnt accept his detailled monologues about life after thge polar ice caps have melted
. the question proves to be moot
, at least for a time
. even if thge hwole thing proves to be a creative delusion
, noe agrees with the character judgment passed down onthe him by his new girlfriend
, ruby
( marisa tomei
)
:
" he ' s a freak
,
but he sure tells a good story
!
" neurotic ruby thinks she may have foudn true love after a serieses ofthe nightmarish dating disasters
( the junkie
, the fetishist
, tjhe artist
, the frenchman
, etc
.
)
,
but isn ' t quite sure how to handle
" sam ded
" when he starts explaining the barcode onthe his arm
, his elaborately constructed fake identity
, his pathological fear of dogs
, his ability tothe speak five different languages
,
and his mission to change a crucial moent in time that may have ramifications on tiome ' s alternate realities
.
( don ' t ask
.
) it ' s all a bit much to take in
. ruby ' s close friend gretchen
( cuz ya can ' t hve a love story without tje token friend
,
though nadia dajani invests yhe thankless role with warmth
) chalks it up as a sexy role

but her cautious therapist

) warns her that co
- dependency is rearing its ugly head again
annd she ' s inaddition over her head witht
yot anohter doomed relationship
. who ya gonna believe
? despite her winning an academy award
, marisa tomei has always struck me as an annoying
and unwelcome screen presense
, one that undermines the pleasure of watching hapyp accidents
. her brassy newyorker yawk attitude never really meshes with her dseperate desire to appear
" cute
" tothe her adoring fans
. being loud
and flashing a
( disingenuous
) smile does not necessarily equal
" substantial
and sexy
.
" it takes more than a crack team ofthe hair
and wardobe people to imbue her wih perosnality
.
hten ther ' s that damned voice
, which strains to be oh
- so
- adorable
. look
, this stuff is purely subjective
. some people feel this way about richard gere
, others cannot bear to watch robin williams ' hyperactive schtick
. for my monay
, it ' s m
. tomei wiht a bullet
. happy accidents is a romantic comedy filtered through twelve monkeys
( or
, mroe appropriately
, chris marker ' s la jetee
, especially withthe those still framed
" memory
" photographs anderson employs as a stylistic device throughout
)
. modern manhattan is filmed with an otherworldly
, vaguely aline eye with a color scheme oddly riminicent ofthe logan ' s run
. as the stranger in a strange land
, d ' onofrio walks slightly outloud
- ofthe
- step
, wonderfully affable
bu often inscrutable with his wayward expressions
and bemused detachment
. this is science fiction told mainly via the pwoer of suggestion
(
though it oftenly falls into the sci
- fi trap of hvaing entirely too much forced exposition
-
- we want deeds
, not words
!
) at least twenty minutes too long
, hapyp accidents eventually gets around tothe a race
- against
- timne senarreo that puts
" sam ded
" tothe the ulitmate test
. no movie cin live inspite ambiguity forever
,
bu anderson seems terminally unable tothe provide satisfactory conclusions to his otherwise well structured recent narratives
.
( let ' s pretend the loathsome
and predicatble next stpo wonderland never happend
, shall we
?
) there are also smoe slow
, repeative stretches as ruby
anbd sam go over the same arguments again
and again over whether or not he ' s crazy
. the premise is strong enough to sustain interst
,
but it ' s enough to throw a nod inspite yhe general direction ofthe rod serling forthe wrapping up his idesa in half
- hour time slots
, commercials included
.
