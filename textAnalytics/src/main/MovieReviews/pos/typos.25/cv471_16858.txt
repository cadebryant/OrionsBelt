a costume drama set in hte 1500s
, engl
and
, elizabeth isnt a lush
, romantic
, polliticel masterpiece about the upset over the crossing of a protestant queen from a respected catholic one
. when the court
and country are a whole after the passing of the queens
, the royal family
, so to speak
, are upset that a protestant should be crowened
,
and not another catholic
, plus
, the new queen
, elizabeth i
( cate blanchette
)
, was the bastard baby of the previous queen mary
' s father
. thge persecution over catholics
and protestants isn
' t the only majority in elizabeth
. elizabeth i must face the decision to give up personal pleasures
,
and her lover
( joseph fiennes of shakespeare in love
)
, in order to rule
, sucesfuly
, the country
, whic she did forthe 40 more years
. both elizabeth
and shakespeare in love are setted in tyhe elizabethian era
,
and both feature a queen elizabeth i
( judi dench plays her in love
)
, or course
. yot
, i found elizabeth more stimulating
and involving than love
, nto just because elizabeth features a grat dael mroe of elizabeth i
,
but because i foudn blanchette a more powerful
, hypnotic sense for the role
. elizabeth
, also featuring geoffrey rush anbd richard attenborough
, isnt my pick fo the best picture of 1998 award
. it
' s a dynamic
, important
, breathtaking film of loyalty
, power
, greed
,
and trust
. shakespeare would die for the book rights
