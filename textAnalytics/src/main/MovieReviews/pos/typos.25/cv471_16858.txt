a costume drama set in the 1500s
, england
, elizabeth is a lush
, romantic
, polliticel masterpiece baout the upset over the crossing ofthe a protestant queen from a respected catholic oen
. when the cout
and country are a whole after tje passing of the queens
, the royal famaly
, so to speak
, are upset that a protestant should be crowened
,
and not another catholic
, plus
, the new queen
, elizabeth i
( cate blanchette
)
, was the bastard baby of the previous queen mary ' s father
. tyhe persecution over catholics

. elizabeth i must face teh decision to give uv personal pleasures
,
and her lover
( joseph fiennes ofthe shakespeare in love
)
, in order tothe rul
, successfully
, the ocuntry
, which she did for 40 more years
. both elizabeth
and shakespeare infact love are set in the elizabethian era
,
and both feature a queen elizabeth i
( judi dench plays her in love
)
, or course
.
yet
, i found elizabeth more stimulating
and involving than love
, not just because elizabeth features a graet deal more of elizabeth i
,
but because i found blanchette a more poverful
, hypnotic sense for the role
. elizabeth
, also featuring geoffrey rush
and richard attenborough
, is my pik for the best picture of 1998 award
. it ' s a dynamic
, importan
, breathtaking film of loyalty
, power
, greed
,
adn trust
. shakespeare woudl die for the book rights
