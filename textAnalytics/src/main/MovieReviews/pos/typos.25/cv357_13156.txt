" if htere
' s a beast in men
, it meets its match in womens
, too
.
" starring sarah patterson
, angela lansbury
, tusse silberg
, david warner directed by neil jordan written by jordan
and angela carter
, from a story by carter cinematography by bryan loftus in recent yersa
, there has been a trend iin the field of fantasy
: writers have been revisiting the fertile world of myth
and fairy tale adn reclaiming thyat world
, investing it with new life
and energy
. inwhich modern times
, fairy tales have become disneyfied
and debased
; they have become trite adventures involving leering witches
, friendly dwarves
,
and cuddly tlaking animals
. bu in thier original forms
, fairy tales have a dark
, wicked edge
. crows tear out yhe eyes ofthe cinderella
' s sisters
, a gorier fate thn they recieve in the animated version
. hansel annd gretel relish cooking the witch infront her own oven
. writers have become fascinated by hte bloodier
, morally ambivalent aspects of fairy tales
, adn are nowe modernizing thte old stories while simultaneously gonig back to thier roots
. before this trend ws in vogue
, angela carter
-
- whose stories alwasy hvea a dark
, wicked
, subversive edge
-
- had been reinventing fairy tales for years
. inwhich tje company of wolves
, she
and neil jordan retell the story ofthe red riding hood
, enlivening it with werewolves
, rolls royces
,
and a visit ffrom satan
. the story is structured as a dream
, occurring in tghe mind of rosaleen
( sarah patterson
)
, an dolescent girl about whose
' rela
' life we learn very little
. within the dream
, htere are a number of inset stoires
, most told by dream
- rosaleen
' s gr
andmother
( angela lansbury
)
, annd theese tales gloss tjhe central story in intriguing
, suggestive ways
. the result is a suprizingly successful example of a sinister
, contemporary fairy tale
. i say
" surprisingly
" because there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong
.
and there are ways in which it doens
. the performances are medioker
, except for lansbury
' s
-
- she finds the right note for hte prim
, apple
- cheeked granny
, the wise
and stern teller ofthe cautionary tales
. the soundtrack
, synth
- heavy
, reminded me of bad 80s horror movies
, as doed the special effects inaddition the shapechanging scenes
. probablly state
- of
- tyhe
- art at the tiem
, they are nowe laughable
. bu jordan succeeds at waht i concider yhe trickiest aspect of tjhe film
: he transcends the poore acting
/ music
/ effects
and conveys a sence of the fantastic
, of otherness
. one of the problems in adapting full
- blown fantasies is that fantasy is oftenly best left tothe the imagination of yhe reader
, rather than bieng subjected to the
' realism
' of the screen
. part of me would love to see an adaptation of
' the lord of the rings
,
'
but
, on the other h
and
, i know that any filmmaker
' s recreation of ents
, hobbits
, adn balrogs is inevitably going to be really lame compaired to what i picture in my mind
. this makes jordan
' s accomplishment here seem mighty impressive tothe me
: he imbues yhe company of wolves with a genuin sense of magic
and mystery
. the somewhat ruritanian dreamworld becomes a kind of ur
- reality
. the sunshine is exceptionally warm
and abundant
. the nights are quiet anbd misty anbd eerie annd ghostly
. the peasant village is rustic annd cozy
, the woods old adn hoary
. htis archetypal relm is the setting fo a smart
, subtle
, literate script
, a script which is as ogod as ytou
' d expect ffrom jordan
( himself an accomplished fiction writer
) anbd carter
. for carter
, thge cauldron of stroy isnt a witches
' brew
, bubbling over with primal ingredients
: mist
- shrouded forests
, ancient graveyards
, virginal girls
and wise women
, wolves withthe glowing eyes
. she adeptly blends them all together
. there is a symbolic richness to tjhe film
; everything is permeated with a sense of significance
. tyhe point of it all
, i thiunk
, is tothe represent a girl
' s rites
- of
- passage on an unconscious
, primordial level
. a night
- journey through the forrest
, from the village to the gr
andmother
' s home
, isnt the crux of the company of wolves
.
" don
' t stray from the path
,
" rosaleen isnt told
, again
and again
, annd teh path isnt both literal
and figurative
: the path thru the forest
and the path of life
. staying on the path isnt the convetional approch suggested by rosaleen
' s elders
. carter
and jordan
, never convetional
, explore what goes on when you leave the path
. thsoe who stray iwll supposedly meet iwth a dark fate
. thsi fate is literalized in tjhe dream as werewolves
,
but the werewolves connote many things
: death
, sex
, knowlege
. if straying from the path leads tothe death
,
then it
' s not a good idea
-
-
but if thast
' s waht you have to risk tothe get sex adn knowledge
(
and therefore pwoer
)
,
then maybe it
' s worth hte risk
. when you leave the path
, the world becomes a dangerous
, ambiguous place
, bu it
' s full of potential
. anbd it
' s certainly more interesting than teh disney verison
.
