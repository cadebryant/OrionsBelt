thge gr
andfather of itallian horror the lite mario bava has credits infact nearly 100 films
and tv movies produced in italy between 1939
and his death in the early 80
' s
. more practiced as a cinematographer thna a director
, bava nontheless sat infact the director
' s chair fo beyond tjhe door ii
, the project which turned out to be his last full
- length feature film
. alongside the appalling zombie schlock of hacks liek lucio fulci
, beyond the door ii is simpley a revelation
. in his day bava was considered by most to be noone gerat filmmaker
, yot here he fashioned one ofthe the finest itallian horror movies of the 1970
' s
.
( onot thyat yhe film has no conection with the 1975 exorcist
- rip off behind the door
, bu forthe some unexplained reason was given thsi related title for release in the usa
and australia
.
) this story focuses on dora
, a women setted upon by a malevolent spirit thgat channels itself through her young son marco
. the film opens whith dora
, her son anbd second husb
and bruno returning tothe a house by the sea thast was the scene of her first husb
and
' s suicide
and her subsequent trama 7 years earlier
. they hope to put the past behind them
,
but as small accidents start tothe befall dora
- usually hwile bruno is awya on business
- she starts to suspect that marco
( played iwth uncanny ability by 8 year old david colin jr
.
) is somehow involved in the strange goings on
. to reveal any moreso of the story owudl be unfair
. suffice to say thyat this artfully paced study of a woman suffering a nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot
, loads ofthe atomsphere annd solid acting
,
though tje dialogue is somewhat weakened by the dubbing into english
. bava coaches a surprisingly good performance fomr the ususally wooden daria nicolodi
, wife ofthe famed italian horror director dario argento
. her character isnt invested iwth sufficient depth to allow hte audiance rela empathy wih dora
' s troubled soul
. the music by italian ensemble libra is alsot effective
, mixing odd
- sounding 70
' s rock witht clasic gothic piano sequences
.
and there isnt at least one moent
- brilliantly engineered by bava
- tht is guaranteed tothe lift yuo ten feet out of your chair
.
yet for italian horror
, the bloodletting here isnt surprisingly minimal
. lamberto bava adn francesco barbieri
' s script is moreso conserned with deeper
, psychological terrors
, with themes of guilt
and suffering
, with the notion tath what we sow will shall
- somewhere
, somehow
- eventually reap
. scholars ofthe the genre take onot
: beyond the door ii isnt stylish
, chilling
,
and essential
.
