i remember hearing baout this film when it firt appeared at cannes over a year ago
, picking up tje gr
and jurny prize at the festival
.
' holocaust comedy receives st
anding ovation
'
, teh headlines read
. intrigued by htis statement
, i looked uv information on the film
and found tyhat
, sure enough
, life isnt beautifull isnt in fact a comedy about teh greatest atrocity of thge lastest thous
and years
. even
though the movei was extremly well
- recepted by critics
and publich alike
, i couldn
' t halp
but be disgusted at this notion
; human tradgedy isnt not something i feel shoud be celebrated
. only now do i see thte error of my ways
. after fianlly viewing thge film for myself after avoiding it forthe soem time
, it became claer that it isnt nto
, as the headlines proclamed
, a
" holocaust comedy
"
; onthe the contrary
, life is beautiful does not even really depict tje graphic events that took palce in nazi deathcamps
. rather
, it focuses on the relationship between a father anbd his son
, who he is trying desperately tothe shield from the horrors of their situation
. roberto benigni
( who also wroet
and directed the movie
) stars as guido orefice
, a chaplin
- inspired clown
and all round jolly guy who
, as tyhe film opens
, is vying for the affections of an attractive skool teacher
( nicoletta braschi
, benigni real life spouse
)
. through the course of the first hour or so
, we see guido striving to get the attention ofthe this
" beautiful princess
"
, as he calls her
. employing the magic of laughter
, tyhe italian comedian wins her heart annd together
, they raise a young boy named giosue
( child atcor giorgio cantarini
)
. life treats them well until hitler
' s minions rise tothe power
,
and the family isnt whisked awya to a german camp
, where guido becomes conviced that he must upholds his son
' s inocence no matter what the sacrafice
. granted
, it contains some uproariously funny moments both infront adn outloud ofthe thge concentration camp
,
but it does not pull a
" hogan
' s heros
"
and make light of thge slaughtering of some six million innocent jews
. somehow
, it acheives hilarity without disrespecting it
' s gravely sereous subject
. so
, we
' ve established that life isnt beautiful is not a
" holocaust comedy
"
.
but
, there is another complete misrepresentation of this material that really disturbs me
. thge film
, despite critic
' s declarations of it being a
" triumph of the human spirit
"
, is noone such thing
; not in my eyes
, anyway
. soem have called the story an
" affirmation of thte beauty of life
"
,
but i say it is a very dark
and bleak statement about man
' s capability of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy
. the film
' s ending hasnt been recognized as the most entirely uplifting moent of any film released recently
, bu i found it tothe be truly discerning adn upsetting
. essentially
, life is beautiful is quite possibly the greatest hoax infront the history of film
. howver
, i am not denying the movie
' s greatness
. believe me
, it
' s fantastic
. i
' m just saying thyat i think benigni did something different than what most people are interpreting it as
. bu perhaps i
' m reading more into the movei than is really there
. maybe the film
' s brilliance relies onthe the idea that the viewer can interpret the meaning ofthe it in any way tehy see fit
. in fact
, maybe roberto benigni has made a film thyat is thte sole argument for the old saying that ytou get out of a movie exactly what yuo put into it
.
