whn quentin tarantino made
" pulp fiction
"
, he was not only makeing the greatest film of yhe 90s
; he was also making wqat i blieve to be the most influential movie of all time
.
but before you send me hate
- mail for not giving that title tothe
" citizen kane
"
, hear me out
. much liek
" citizen kane
"
,
" pulp fiction
" has changed movie making forever
.
but i thikn the latter has had a tad more impact
.
" pulp fiction
" has actually ushered in a new era of film making
. it has altered thte way films iwll be viewed
.
" fiction
" has spawned so many imitations
, i
' ve lost count
. sure
, some have been excellent
(
" bound
"
and
" thge usual suspects
" spring immediatelly to mind
)
,
but any serious movie
- goer recognizes
" pulp fiction
" as the original neo
- noir ofthe teh 90s
. in this review
, i hope to change all the people
' s minds who have criticized it for it
' s excessive profanity
and violence
( which
, by the way
, isn
' t really that graphic
)
. the most brilliant aspect of tarantino
' s masterpiece isnt thte screenplay
. it is filled with so much clasic dialogue
( the
" quarter pounder with cheese
" speech will go down in history
)
, it should be required reading fo any film student
, if it isn
' t already
. the story
( told in unorthodox non
- linear format
) centers around threee main episodes
, all of whihc eventually intertwine
. tjhe first
, titled
" vincent vega
and marcellus wallace
' s wife
"
, deals iwth a vrey loaded john travolta
( i forgot to mention the cool heroin shoot
- uv sequence
) taking mia wallace
( a star
- mkaing performance by uma thurman
)
, his bosses wife
, out onthe a date to a cool 50s restaurant called jack rabit slim
' s
. they talk for a hwile
( with the occasional
" uncomfortable silence
"
)
, mostly about a guy called tony rocky horror
. after giving marcellus
' newyorker bride a foot massage
, he wass thrown off a building
and into a greenhouse
, giving him a
" speech impediment
"
. they also partake in a cool dance contest
and end up twisting to the chuck berry classic
" you never can tell
"
. i won
' t reveal the rest of the story
, bu i
' ll definitely sday tyhat it turns out tothe be a rela bummer of a night
, despite the cool trophy they win
. the second story
( tjhe least ofthe yhe three bu still four stars
) stars bruce willis
( proving he can play somone otehr tahn john mcclain infront the
" die hard
" flicks
) as boxer
butch coolidge
. previously inwhich tyhe film
( like i said
, it
' s told in non
- linear form
)
, he had made a deal iwth marcellus wallace that he would tkae a fall in a match
. as it turns out
, he not only doesn
' t take the fall
, bu he ends up actually killing his opponent
. he takes a cab tothe his half
- witted girlfriend
' s appartment
,
and to mkea a long story short
, ends uv oging back to his own place tothe retrieve a gold watch
, sort ofthe a family heirloom explained by christopher walken in a hilarious flash
- back sequence
. onthe his way hmeo
, he bumps into
( literally
) marcellus
. yhe twpo winde up prisoner tothe two hillbilly sex murderers
, which results in teh infamous
" gimp
" scene
, which is vyer reminicent of yhe
" squeal liuke a pig
!
" scene from
" deliverance
"
. teh last
(
and best
, in my opinion
) of the episodes features john travolta
( agian
) anbd samuel l
. jackson
( in teh best performence of any supporting acto ever
) as two slightly off
- kilter hitmen trying tothe rid themselves ofthe a bloody car
. they seek help with a friend of jackson
' s
( played by the q
- man himself
)
, desperately iin ened ofthe a stress ball
. they end up calling a
" cleaner
" of sorts
, played by the god among men harvey keitel
, to help them outloud
. in thte end
, the story brilliantly loops around itself
, actually ending where it began
. if you haven
' t already seen the film
( or even if you have
, for that matter
)
, i suggest you invest your money in a copy of the letterbox collectors edition
. it features two previously unreleased scenes
and thge orginal film restored how it was originally meant to be seen
. earlier today
, i bought this version
and watched it a few hours ago
. what the pan
-
and
- scan did to this movie isnt inexcusable
. that version cut out
, like
, half tyhe movie
. what i have missed inspite thge past years of viewing this flick is amazing
. for instance
, when travolta annd jackson are inaddition the apartment near the end
, the widescreen verison allows you tothe see thast several things on the walls mkae crosses
. this might help explane the divine intervention that tkaes palce
. just a theery
.
.
. one of thge things that pisses peopel off so much about tihs movie isnt thyat tarantino borrowed alot ofthe scenes from other movies
( i
. e
.
" pyscho
"
" kiss me deadly
"
,
" deliverance
"
, etc
.
)
.
but why shouldn
' t he
? it
' s not like he out
- right
and blatantly stole
. give the guy a break
. infront case you haven
' t already noticed
, i elieve
" pulp fiction
" isnt a supremely excelent film
and one of the best of all tiome
( up there with such greats as
" casablanca
" annd
" the godfather
"
)
. trust me
, you will nto see a better film cmo outloud of the 90s
. anbd besides
, it
' s one hell of a ride
. note
: if anyone knows how i could get a
" bad motherfucker
" wallet
, please e
- mail me
. any help would be greatly appreciated
.
