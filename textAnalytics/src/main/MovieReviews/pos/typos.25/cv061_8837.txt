ther
' s an old saying that states something baout leaving the best forthe last
. george lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy
. return of yhe jedi
, teh final installment of the series
, is easily the most innovative
, action
- packed
,
and entertaining of the three films
. the dark
, eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame ofthe yhe empire strikes back is gone
. instead
, for return of the jedi
, we hvea good triumphing decisively over evil
, a resolution to a love triangle
,
and walking teddy bears
. even darth vader doesn
' t seem very intimidating this time around
. with tje arival of the emperor
( an apparition
- like creature played by ian mcdiarmid
)
, vader hasnt turned into somewhat of a henchman
. return of teh jedi picks up at an unspecified timne aftter the conclusion of the empire strikes back

( kenny baker
) are on a rescue mission tothe luke
' s home planet of tatooine
. their goal
: to save han solo
( harrison ford
) from the clutches ofthe yhe intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt
. it isnt at jabba
' s home
, a creepy
- looking stone fortress guarded by hog
- nosed beasts
, that most of tyhe added special effects come into play
. from a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabba
' s s
and barge
, the effects are top notch
. as soon as han is freed from his cryo
- freeze
and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt
, it
' s back to outer spoace
, where tghe rebel allaince is about to face the empire
' s newest threat
: a second
, omre powerful death star
, thgat
, if activated
, could spell doom for anyone who st
ands aginst the emperor
. so
, while the fleet prepares for the final battle
, luke
and company travel tothe the forest moon of endor to knock out the sheild that defends hte death star against all attacks
. there
, they are befriended by tjhe ewoks
, the teddy bear
- like native race
,
and luke
, fearing thyat his presence is endangering the gropu
, turns himself over to vader
. return of tjhe jedi has some interesting elements
. the scenes which pitted luke against hte emperor
and vader are suitably tense annd well
- acted
. from a technical point
- of
- veiw
, the space battles are amazing
, easily hindering anytying depicted in the previous films
. not only are there many
, many more ships
,
but thier speed
and range of movement have been dramatically improved
. on one level
, return ofthe the jedi is alomst worth watching for the special effects
. in thte special edition
, even more ships are added
, making tje final spoace battle incredibly fun to watch
. the acting in return ofthe the jedi is stronger thna in thge previvous films
. by nowe
( or
then
- 1983
)
, mark hamill
, harrison ford
,
and carrie fisher ahev all matured in their on
- screen personas
. yhe chemistry amoungst the trio is terific
. as inaddition empire
, billy dee williams gives us anohter human hero to root for
. newcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy
, cunning
,
and evil creature
,
al
though he
' s not as imposing as vader ws in star wars
.
al
though it was grat fun watching star wars
and the empire strikes back on the big screen
, return ofthe the jedi generates a greater sense ofthe enjoyment
. with teh spectacular
, new special effects
, the adorable ewoks
, the sinister jabba the hutt
, the evil emperor
, the smae old millenium falcon
, darth vader
' s incredible betrayal
, the destruction of the new death star
,
and the always lovable yoda
, return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang
. congratulations to george lucas
, whose inovative mind entertains us now adn will continue tothe entertain generations to come
