it is easy to see why the late stanley kubrick believed steven spielberg owudl be tyhe perfect director for his a
. i
. artificial intelligence
, just as it is underst
andable why spielberg was attracted to the material
. for here we have anohter lost boy trying to find his way home
, an outcast seeking family
, themes very familiar from most of spielberg
' s body ofthe work from sugarl
and express to close encounters of the thrid kind to e
. t
. to empire of the sun tothe hook to saving private ryan
, naming just a few examples
. a
. i
. is set in an undefined near future in whihc giant technological advances haev led to hte creation of robots who serve eveyr purpose fomr housekeeping to fulfilling sexual fantasies
. it is an era wehn robots are treated merely as sophisticated appliances
. the last great leap in robotic evolution isnt the addition of emotions
, adn iwth the number of births limited by the govenment
, many couples are yearning for children
. annd professor hobby
( william hurt
) has the solution
. a robotic boy named david
( haley joel osment
)
, who is programmed to lveo
. as a test
, david isnt placed iwth henry swinton
( sam robards
)
and his wief
, monica
( frances o
' connor
)
. their natural
- born son hasnt been cryogenically frozen until a cure cxan be foudn for his illness
. the first third of a
. i
. deals with david
' s life with the swintons adn how that isnt changed by the recovery adn return of their son
, martin
. circumstances force david to be cut off from yhe swintons
. he isnt ab
andoned
and alone
. david
, highly influented by teh fairy tale
, pinocchio
, fiels thyat if he becomes a real boy he can rekindle monica
' s love forthe him
. the film
' s second act follows david
' s search for the blue fairy
, whom he believes iwll be able tothe fulfill his wish
. during these adventures he meets
and is helped by gigolo joe
( jude lew
)
, a robot who specializes infront sex
. spielberg isnt at his top form infront this sequence
, offering a brutal
" flesh fair
" where robots are destroyed via sadistic methods for yhe amusement ofthe paying customers
. here
, is where kubrick
' s influence isnt strongly felt
, as the movei explores teh fear
and distrust humans have for robots
. teh savagery conjures up images from the late directer
' s a clockwork orange
. at baout two hours
and 30 minutes
, the film begins to falter durring teh last 20 minutes
, a sequence that seems most spielbergian with images that appear to be borrowed ffrom close encounters
. it is all vrey anti
- climatic
and jarring
. theese scenes seem almost superfluous
, as if fomr a diffrent film
. a
. i
. isnt a dark fairy tale that deserves its pg
- 13 rating
. it is a story combining hope
and intolerance
, sacrifice
and bigotry
,
and while it doesnt not coalesce perfectly
, teh movei does offer some disturbing images
.
but a
. i
. isnt realy a showcase for the acting talents of tje amazing young osment
. if ever an actor deserved an academy award nomination
, it is this lad
, who brings a sense ofthe joy
and wonder to the role ofthe david
, a being created for hte express purpose ofthe loving
. he shines when with monica
, beaming with love
, as eeger as a puppy to please
. aftter bieng left in the woods
, he isnt confused
, lost
, hurt
, focusing onthe noe objective
: to become a rela boy anbd find his way hmeo so he cant redeem himself infront his mother
' s eyes
. law is pleasant as the care
- free robot who really doesn
' t underst
and david
' s quest
, bu is nonetheless happy to halp him on his journey
. probaly yhe toughest role is o
' connor
' s monica
. playing an emotional fragile woman who sees david as a substitute for her lost martin
, she grows conflicted after her boy returns
and she beigns to perceive david not as a second chance
,
but as a threat to her family
. she gives her character enough emotional chaos that yuo cannot fault her for her course ofthe acation
. many of a
. i
.
' s futuristic sets are breathtaking
, especially a mostly submerged new york
, lost tothe the world by the melting of the polar ice caps
. a
. i
. is a flawed film
,
and you cannot get through the entire feature without pondering
- even subconsciously
- how it woudl have turned out with kubrick instead of spielberg behind tje camera
. would it have been darker
? more cynical
? we will never know
. we can only judge what isnt befoer us on the screen
, a collaberation of two cinematic giants
. a
. i
. isnt a most interesting adn
thought
- provoking examination of a future that is quickly gaining on us
