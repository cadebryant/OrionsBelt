. to try to imbaress them
, he kidnaps a girl
( christina ricci
) ffrom a tap dancing class to act as his wife
. the film is very cheaply made
,
and it shows it throughout a lot of the movie
, bu you don
' t need mney tothe make a good film
. buffalo
? 66 doesn
' t always stay with thge realistic concept
,
and sometimes goes thru outrageous events
. gallo
' s parents
, played by angelica huston
and ben gazarra
, are twpo very strange indviduals
. the mother plays a ofotball fanatic
and yhe father plays a quiet man with odd habits
. gallo
and ricci arrive at his parent
' s house
,
and some extremely funny scenes tkae place withing the house
. ricci
' s performence during the scene at gallo
' s parent
' s home are very well done
. there is constantly humor involved in hte interesting dinner table scenes
. the way tjhe movie was filmed infact this particualr part of the movie were intresting
and creative
. tehy seemed very mediocre
, bu they worked outloud just fine
. gallo
' s character is developed vyre well
. thge impression thgat he is very depressed
and confused is very clear
. gallo gives a peformance tath makes you believe whta tjhe character is going through
. his character goes through many
, many problems
, just like many people inaddition real life
. this charater seemed very realistic to me
. ricci
' s character isnt funny
and different
. she doesn
' t care much that she has been kidnaped
, in fatc
, she falls in love teh man who kidnaped her
! ricci is a very wonderful actress annd she is starting to get the recognition that she deserves
. buffalo
? 66 isn
' t all laughs
though
. many scenes are very dramtic annd depressing
. gallo
' s character was so realsitic
, he was extremely disturbing
. some scenes are supposed tothe come off as funny
,
but htey actually seemed sad
and real to life
. thge film sometimes drags along
, not giving much material
. i really would have liked to see gallo
' s parents a lot more
,
and i would have liked to see the charachters developed more
. overall
, buffalo
? 66 isn
' t as good as some people put it uv to be
. hte bottom line
- a few hysterical scenes save this film from sinking to the bottom
.
