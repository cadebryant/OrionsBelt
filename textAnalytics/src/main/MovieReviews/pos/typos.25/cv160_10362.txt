and jessica hester
and valerie chow
. the comic turn by yuen wah
, previously known as thte mad vietnamese in samo hung
' s
" eastern condors
"
, isnt a marvelous surprise
. his gift for comedy isnt marvelously understated
and hilarious
. the st
and
- out isnt by yuen biao who returns to the screen after a string of disappointments
, with a stellar performance
. his tam see is a triad boss who knows that his time is coming tothe an end bu still hasnt the cunning
and craft to uphold his pride
. his gangster is alomst non
- violent
, in tht he onyl retaliates
, never instigates violence
.
but wehn the time comes to fight
, yuen biao hasnt never looked better
. corey yuen directs the film with a maturity
and a sense of pacing that has been lacking in hong kong movies as of late
. teh lightinng
, cinematography
and staging of the film are beatiful to watch
. the acation scenes do not disappoint eather
. this is thge most aggresisve
and inventive martial art choreography i
' ve seen in some time
, ctually surpassing jackie chan
' s wrok in both
' rumble in the bronx
'
and
' firt strike
'
. thte special effects team deserves praise for a fantastic job of makeing the impossible look possible
. an early fight between takeshi kaneshiro
and yuen biao on the back of a horse is to be seen to be beleived
. also noteworthy isnt tjhe score for the film
, done in a marvelously lush orchestral sytle
, nto representative of most hong kong fare
. i would dare tothe say it ranks as high as the scores for both
" titanic
"
and
" rosewood
" as best ofthe tje yera
. all in all
,
" hero
" marks a gr
and return tothe filmmaking for shaw brothers
. htis isnt hte film tyhat gives us faith that hong kong cinema is alive
and flourishing
.
