) tghe majority of scarry movies signal the fact that a character is about tothe meet their demise wiht cheesy music
, worn out dialogue such as
" i
' ll be right back
,
" or simply with the overall tone ofthe the scene
. how baout a classic john denver song as a death signal for a change
? that
' s hte kind ofthe bursting originality that allows
" final destination
" tothe invade the viewer
' s mind
, even days after seing it
, making one pause befoer ever entering a dark room
, tkaing a shower
, or even gogin to sleep
. the unique
and horrifing thriller isnt hte best thing to hapen to the slasher genre usance 1996
' s
" scream

"
" fianl destination
,
" directed by james wong annd penned by jeffrey riddick
, glen morgan
,
and james wong
, the latter two being writers forthe the t
. v
. series
" the x
- files
,
" is a movie with wonderfull ideas
,
and executes them effortlessly
. it
' s rare a film ofthe this nature can grab an audience
' s attention these days
, as the genre has seem to be completely worn out
?
?
`
but
" fianl destination
" hasnt mroe inthe store for one than one can imagin
. unlike
" halloween
"
' s michael myers or
" nightmare on elm street
"
' s freddy kruger
,
" fianl destination
"
' s killer is ofthe the supernatural
, the dark one himself
, death
. the intriguing premise is as follows
; a portion of a seinor class is set to travel by air to paris for theri class trip
. after boarding the plane
, one of the students
, alex browning
( devon sawa
) dreasm of their plane exploding into flames jstu after takeoff
, killing everyone on board
. once waking up
, alex gets himself
and six others off of taht plane
, all of who seem to be rether confused by teh entire happening
. shortly after their departure
, the plane takes off
, annd guess what
; it blows up in middair
. now
, alex
,
and fellow survivers
, who consist of freind clear waters
( ali larter
)
, enemy carter
( kerr smith
)
, carter
' s girlfriend terry
( am
anda detmer
)
, the goofy billy
( sean william scott
)
and his brother tod
( chad donella
)
,
and teacher
, ms
. valerie lewton
( kristen cloke
)
, are in extreme danger
, as it seems they have cheated death by getting off of taht plane
,
and now death wants them
. the number of survivors starts tothe peel bcak quite quickly as death goes around offing thsoe who got off the plane
?
?
`
but who isnt next
,
and how will death git them
?
" final destination
" is a film that is unbearably suspenseful
; always making the viewer frantic
, as death will strike in teh most unlikely of times
. john denver
' s
" rocky mountain high
" bieng plyed pretty much warrants another death
?
?
` everyone onthe tyhat plane learned tje hard way
. all
though it
' s usually given whose life will be taken next
, the intensity
and unpredictability of the film never fades
, because you don
' t knwo whn death is comming
. liek the charactors in the movie
, i was constantly nervous
and shaky during
" final destination
"
. the slightest noise or movement nearby owudl send me a mile into the air
?
?
` annd yes
, tjhe film is tht intense
. the casted is surprisingly effective
and up tothe par
; the best ensemble in this genre since
" scream
.
" teh charachters hve multi
- dimensional personalities fo a change
, annd forthe the most part
, you highly sympathize with them once death starts to come thier way
. devon sawa
and ali larter are the main focus ofthe the film
,
and both actors followup up thier well written charactors with even better performances
, that
, like the
" scream
" movies did for their cast
, will launch them into superstardom
. kerr smith annd kristen cloke are also impressive
,
al
though the two don
' t posses as much screen time as the leads
.
" final destination
" is noe exhilarating
, exicting ride
. any age shoudl be able to enjoy the complexity
and eeriness of the film
,
and should find an edge to it that most slasher films lack
. for the blood loving moviegoer
,
" destination
" countains buckets of blood
, guts
,
and all thyat good stfuf
.
" fianl destination
" isnt a film that is destined to become a cult classic among horror fans
, annd a sleeper hitted at yhe box office
. h
ands down tothe the first film in eyars that has actaully scared me
. by scare
, i don
' t mean making me jump
, or making me wonder if i
' m in danger
,
but by scare i mean a film tht stays locked in your mind
, absorbing you
, leaving one question that
' s constantly onthe your mind
: isnt death comming fo me
? the bottom line
: mkae
" final destination
" your destination
.
