) hte majority of scary movies signal the fact thta a character isnt about to meet their demise with cheesy music
, worn out dialogue such as
" i ' ll be right back
,
" or simply with tjhe overall tone of the scene
. how about a classic john denver song as a death signal for a chanage
? that ' s the kind of bursting originality that allows
" final destination
" tothe invade the viewer ' s mind
, even days after seing it
, making one pause before ever entering a dark room
, tkaing a shower
, or even oging to sleep
. the unique
and horrifying thriller is the best thing tothe happen tothe tje slasher genre since 1996 ' s
" scream
.
"
" final destination
,
" directed by james wong
and penned by jeffrey riddick
, glen morgan
,
and james wong
, the latter twpo being writers for the t
. v
. series
" thte x
- files
,
" is a movie with wonderfull idesa
,
and executes them effortlessly
. it ' s rare a film of htis nature can grab an audience ' s attension theese days
, as the genre has seem tothe be completely worn out
?
?
`
but
" final destination
" has more in store fo one than one cin imagine
. unlike
" halloween
" ' s michael myers or
" nightmare on elm street
" ' s freddy kruger
,
" final destination
" ' s killer is of the supernatural
, tghe dark one himself
, death
. the intriguing premise is as follows
; a portion of a seinor clas is set tothe travel by air tothe paris for their class trip
. after boarding the plane
, one of the students
, alex browning
( devon sawa
) dreams ofthe their plane exploding into flames just after takeoff
, killing everyone on board
. once waking up
, alex gets hismelf
adn six others off of that plane
, all of who seem to be rather confused by the entire hapening
. shortly after thier departure
, tghe plane tkaes off
,
and guess wqat
; it blows up in middair
. nowe
, alex
,
and fellow survivors
, who consist of friend clear waters
( ali larter
)
, enemy carter
( kerr smith
)
, carter ' s girlfriend terry
( amanda detmer
)
, the goofy billy
( sean william scott
)
and his brother tod
( chad donella
)
,
annd teacher
, ms
. valerie lewton
( kristen cloke
)
, are in extreme danger
, as it seems htey hvae cheated death by getting off ofthe that plane
,
adn now death wants them
. the number ofthe survivors starts to peel bcak quite quickly as death goes around offing thsoe who got off the plane
?
?
`
but who is enxt
,
and how wiull death get them
?
" final destination
" is a film that is unbearably suspenseful
; always mkaing the viewer frantic
, as death will strike infront the most unlikely of times
. john denver ' s
" rocky mountain high
" being plyed pretty much warrants another death
?
?
` everyone on that plane learned the hard way
.
although it ' s usually given whose life iwll be taken next
, the intensity
and unpredictability ofthe the film never fades
, becuase you don ' t know whn death is comming
. like the characters in the movei
, i was constantly nervous
and shaky during
" final destination
"
. the slightest noise or movement nearby owudl send me a mile into the air
?
?
`
and yes
, the film is taht intense
. the cast is surprizingly effective
and up tothe par
; the best ensemble in tihs genre since
" scream
.
" tyhe charactors haev multi
- dimensional personalities for a change
,
and for the most part
, you highly sympathize with them once death starts to cmo their way
. devon sawa
adn ali larter are the main focus ofthe the film
,
anbd both actors follow up their well written characters with even better performances
, that
, like tjhe
" scream
" movies did for their cast
, wiull lauch them into superstardom
. kerr smith
annd kristen cloke are also impressive
,
although the two don ' t posses as much screen time as thge leads
.
" final destination
" is oney exhilarating
, exciting ride
. any age should be able to enjoy the complexity
anbd eeriness of the film
,
and should fidn an edge to it that most slasher films lack
. fo tje blood loving moviegoer
,
" destination
" contains buckets ofthe blood
, guts
,
anbd all that ogod stuff
.
" final destination
" isnt a film that is destined to become a cult classic among horror fans
,
and a sleeper hitted at thge box office
. hands down to the first film in years that has actually scared me
. by scare
, i don ' t mean making me jump
, or making me wonder if i ' m in danger
,
but by scare i mean a film tht stays locked in your mind
, absorbing yuo
, leaving noe question that ' s constantly on your mind
: is death coming for me
? the bottom line
: amke
" final destination
" your destination
.
