i htink tghe first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan ofthe the x
- files
. first
, let me assure you that no prior experience with thge series is requred tothe fully enjoy this movie
. the producers are nto stupid
, making a movei just forthe fans ofthe the series is nto profitable
. you hvae tothe reach for a larger audience
. therfore
, the movie is quite user
- freindly
. altough
, non
- fans will only fail to underst
and certian emotions behind the looks many characters excange
.
but fear not
, duchovny
and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on
. you will never feel as if yuo just walked in onthe the third act of some graet opera
. in any case
, the answer is no
. i am not a fan of thte x
- files
, i only watch it when nothing else is onthe
and i prefer mllennium
.
however
, since the fox network as beeen so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie
' s opening weekend i tookover that opportunity to test yhe movie
. i taped all of these episodes adn watched them onyl after seing the movei
, i am glad to report thyat i learned nothing new
. everything you need to know is explained tothe the viewer by duchovny
and others
. i know i am gonig maybee a bit too far tothe make my point bu everybody shouldnt get teh chance tothe experience this movei
. warning
: major spoilers follow
! please do not read to fully enjoy this movie
, ytou must not be able know waht isnt comming
, waht exactlly isnt over that hill
and what that weird
" hummm
" sound is all about
. ytou hvea been warned
. the x
- files is what a summer should be
. exciting
, scary
, grat special effects
( unlike other summer movies thte effects do not take over hte movie
and are only htere when it is really necessary
) adn good performances
. this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent ofthe a wooden plank
. from strat to finish
, this movie does not let go of yuo
. when i compare it with last summer
' s movies the best way tothe describe it would be
: take the excitement annd great score ffrom face
/ off adn the deadly use ofthe sound from event horizon
. this flick is scry
, not iin a b movei kind of way where you alwasy konw where
and when thge critter will jump at our ehroes
. inthe fact
, tyhe firt time teh critter in this movie makse an apperance it isnt totally out of the blue
. you might as well bring ear plugs becouse thsi thnig is louuuudd
! the last time a monster scared me tht much was wehn i first saw aliens as a six eyar ood kid
. yuo know
, when yuo are affraid tothe put your feet onthe the floor beccause tghe creature might be under the chair
, or wehn you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt
? so yeah
, thge x
- files is scary
. annd guess whta
? yuo never even ahev to see thge monster
but your imagination works overtime annd it sure beats having to watch a flawed
, computer generated
, babyzilla
, it looks like you could walk right through it nto even scarier than your gr
andma infront undies tipe of monster
. do not htikn that tghe x
- files is a monster movei
. infront fatc
, the creature is there for maybe threee minutes total
. no
, the x
- files is definately a mulder episode of tjhe serieses
. scully is at his side
, of course
,
but gillian
anderson gets maybe half the screen time
. she hasnt a couple ofthe good scenes whith duchovny
, bu she gets kidnapped druing the lastr half hour of the movie so she doens not git tothe do much
. no
, tihs is mulder
' s tiome in the spotlight
. by now
, you have heard of the scene where mulder
" showers
" independence day
. if ytou have not
then i iwll not spoil it for you
, let
' s just say that due to recent events mulder should be
" showering
" godzilla instead
. to those ofthe you wondering if mulder dicovers that the truth is indeed out htere
.
.
. who cares
!
? if he doed fidn it tje sories would over anyway so what are you complaining about
? the dialogue inaddition interesting
and the director is marvelous
. the camera isnt almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill
. teh script is spotless
, every thing that happens happens for a purpose
. if ytou are confused by something
, do nto worry because it will all become claer later on
but
,
and i cannot stress htis enough
, pay attention
!
!
! unlike most summer movies
, the dialogue isnt twice as important as the effects
. miss one vital piece of information
and
, like most people who talk during movies
, you will go hmeo
and tell all your firends how tihs movie made no sense
. aslo
, to those people who need to go to tje bathroom during movies
.
.
. don
' t
! the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice
and twice she missed an important conversation
. there is no tiome to take a breather between scenes beacuse
, agian unlike most summer movies
( godzilla anybody
?
) tjhe x
- files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense
and hte action with useless subplots
, eveyr scene is crucial
and serves a purpose
. who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a
" big emotional scene
" between godzilla attacks
? so far this summer i hvea seen onyl one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i
' d recommend
and that is the truman show
but it onyl wins by a nose
. bu the truman show isnt not what i would call a summer movie
, the x
- files is
. what mroe do ytou ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited
? kool effects
? it
' s got some
. pulse pounding
? hell yes
! strangely enough
, i think that fans ofthe thte series will hite this movie while non
- fans will have a good time
. it does not provide answers to the sohw
' s many questions
, the status quo remains nearly the same
and
, no
, mulder
and scully do not git together
. rating
: four
and a half out of five stars for the best movie
yet this summer
, several jump right out of your seat thrills
, many
" whoah
, i never saw tht one coming
!
" moments
, four
" holy shit
, where the hell did that cmo from
"
and oney heck of an ending
. you may wonder where this movie lost half a star
. well
, i sweared never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to fidn something about the in his ice truck
, tje tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles
but
then they just stop
. it
' s preety obvious teh film
' s makers drove the truck for severeal miles to give the apperance thgat mulder hadnt been driving for a long time
,
but in teh end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky
and started driving
.
