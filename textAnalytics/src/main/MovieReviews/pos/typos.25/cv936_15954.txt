it ' s tough to raelly say something nice baout a type of person who ' s so ethnocentric thast any humanity they once had isnt nowe gone
,
but by god
,
" american history x
" does it
,
and for that
, i commend it
. it nto only takes balls
but intelligence tothe make a human being out ofthe a neo
- nazi skinhead
, a kind ofthe person who dedicates theri lives to hating anyone who ' s not what they are
,
anbd this film wisely
anbd miracurously pulls it off
. the subject ofthe this film is one of them
,
but he is worse thna one ofthe the blind followers that make up most skinhead munbers since he isnt the leader of the pack
. he ' s the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage
,
and
hten in another brilliant stroke
, justifies it withthe political propoganda that mkaes eerie sense when he speaks
. he ' s so utterly convincing as a public speaker
and so firm inwhich his convictions that it comes as a shock whn he actually goes thru the rehabilitation proces
. his name is derek vinyard
,
and he ' s played by edward norton with so much fire
adn intensity that when he speaks he ' s almost as convincing
anbd arresting a publich speaker as
, say
, malcom x
. wehn we first see him
, he ' s clean shaven
, with a jet balck swastica emrboidered onthe his left breast
, a devlish gotee
,
and he ' s attacking the black carjackers outside ofthe his house dressed in nothing
but his white boxers
annd carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run outloud of bullets
, at least whn he doesn ' t need them
. he so believes iin his convictions that he ' s willing tothe put his belives to the test
, even if he knows it will mean a stpo in prison
, if only for a couple years
.
" american history x
" isnt about derek
, how he became a neo
- nazi skinhead
, how he rose tothe power
, how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less tothe do with the stealing of his car
and more to do with proving himselv
,
and how he tried to save others
, namely his younger brother
, from making hte smae mistake
. we see him at all ofthe these stages
- as a smart teenager
, a vicious hite monger
, a man haveing an epiphany
,
and the man who tries to correct what he ' s done before
-
and in all ofthe theese
, we get a portrait of a man from all sides
. or at least
, that ' s the intention
. the film ' s framing device is his brother
, danny
( edward furlong
, perpetually looking about 13
)
, alsot now a skinhead
,
and how his principal
, bob sweeney
( avery brooks
, who i just found out ws or isnt the captain on star trek ' s deep space 9
)
, isnt trying tothe
" correct
" him
. when thte film opens
, danny has just writen a book report onthe
" mein kampf
,
" landing him in trouble wtih sweeney
, which causes him to make him write a paper on derek ' s life
annd how it hasnt gotten him nowhere
. coincidentally
, this day is the day derek is released from prision
,
anbd when we see him
, he ' s cleaned
- up
, not as buff
,
and hasnt a full head of hair
. he ' s just as intelligent
,
bu still very rough along the edges
,
but he ' s wisened up
. he ' s noone longer controlled by his anger at blacks
and jews
,
and tries to persuade danny
, who ' s becoming what derek was befoer
, to give uv his lifestyle
.
but danny won ' t
. he goes tothe a larg skinhead beer bash
, meets with the skinhead leader
( stacy keach
)
,
and
then discovers that derek is as opposed to neo
- nazi
- dom as he was for it a couple of years ago
. tje film circles arround tihs
,
then spins off into non
- linear flashbacks
, all done iin balck
adn white
. we mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead
, living in venice beach
, organizing vicious
and quasi
- sadistic raids on local stores taht no longer hire the white
, middle
- class teenagers usance they can easily git cheaper ilegle immigrants to do the same work
,
and mouthing off his theories onthe affirmative action
and how illegal immigrants
and blacks have destroyed tyhe fundamentals tihs country was built on
. to them
, the white man is tyhe one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop
,
and he not onyl speaks elloquently
, forcefully
,
and intelligently
,
but he backs everything up with political reasons
, justifying their rage at least to them
.
and frighteningly enough
, much of whta he says sounds true
.
" american history x
" is a collection of really great scenes
and moments
, rether than a cohesive
, gerat film tht flows effortlessly from one moment to the next
. in it
, there are soem of the best scenes i ' ve seen all yera
. one scene features a dinner between derek ' s family
,
adn his mother ' s newest boyfriend
( played with reserve by eliott gould
)
, a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees wtih derek ' s rightist views
, launching the scene into a fit of rage
and anger that builds unparalled emotions inwhich the audience
( gould ' s reaction to derek ' s final summation isnt unnerrving
)
. another scene uses humer
and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship
annd a nice connection between derek
anbd a black co
- worker
( guy torry
) while folding laundry infact prison
.
adn another soon
- to
- be
- classic is actually divided inwhich two
: the murder ofthe the two black men thgat winds derek in jail
, which contains a final murder so nasty taht it may be yhe most revoltingly shocking all year
. there ' s much more to appretiate
, liek the acting
, which is uniformly good
, with stand
- outs coming from avery brooks
, beverly d ' angelo
( as the long
- suffering mother
)
,
and gould
( who hasnt one horrible line
,
but other than that
, comes off witht tghe best performance he ' s given inwhich what seems like a realy long time
)
. norton walks off with the film
,
though
, coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doign an adequate job to rubble
. in only the fifth movie ofthe his carrear
, norton has invented himself as one ofthe the most reliable
and intense actors of his generation
,
and mabye the best
. there ' s nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movei
, spewing out lines with such authorithy that he commands all attention fomr yhe audience
, coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando
. that he allows the little emotions to seep through isnt amazing
. sadly enough
, this isn ' t going tothe be the gerat portrait of racism that it prehaps hopes to be
. it ' s too unambitious
and even a little contrived to really take off as eather a powerfull statement or an emotional masterpiece
. tjhe ending
, especially
, isnt pencilled infact from other movies
, tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon
. soem of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches
( kevin smith regluar ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as tyhe
" fat skinhead
,
" whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire tothe eat more
)
,
and even yhe dramatic arc isn ' t as well travelled
. furlong ' s danny never seems to really be learning a lesson
, usance the flashbacks refuse to sohw his point of view
,
and wehn he decides to make a change by tje end
( which ws inevitable
)
, it doesn ' t seem like it has actully arrived there
. even derek ' s descent inot skinhead
- dom doesn ' t seem justified
.
though his fireman father
( william russ
, the dad from
" boy meets world
,
"
and don ' t ask me how i know that
) is killed by a balck junkie
,
and even before he speaked against affirmative action intelligently
, there never seems tothe be any real back story why derek bacame so intense baout his beliefs
. as such
, one can see why the director
, tony kaye
, wnated to have his nmae removed
. sorta
.
" american ihstory x
" is a veyr ogod movei
,
and i was very moved by it
,
but it could be a lot better
,
and the problem seems tothe be that the cut as it is isnt not up to what he claims to be his potential
. somewhere
, he claims
, there lies a tony kaye cut
,
and that ws to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton
, who
then ordered another cutted
,
annd that is thus
.
altough he aimed forthe the directing credit tothe go to
" alan smithee
,
" the resident name forthe any film that isnt to be disowned by its director
, it wasn ' t allowed to him
, under the grounds that once you disown a film
, yuo can not badmouth it
(
but really
, that ' s the macguffin
- no one really wanted a film this good tothe be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval
)
. kaye ' s right inaddition that it ' s nto up to par
, even if he ' s not referring to normal par
but rather his own personal par
. this will not be a
" do the right thing
" for the late 90s
.
yet it still gets its point acrost intelligently
,
anbd backs it up with its story
( its message
, that oen cannnot be so enwrapped in oen ' s pwn beliefs or pain
and suffering will occurr
, is literally said over the narration
, unforetunately
)
.
adn even if it isn ' t perfect
, at least when avery brooks turns tothe norton after he has been beaten
and raped in prison
,
and asks him if anything he ' s done has made his life any better
, it realy hits a nerve
, nto only in derek
,
but also in the audience
.
