it
' s tough to really sday something nice about a tipe of person who
' s so ethnocentric tath any humanity they once hadnt is now gone
, bu by god
,
" american history x
" does it
, adn for thta
, i commend it
. it not onyl tkaes balls
but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo
- nazi skinhead
, a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone who
' s not what they are
, anbd thsi film wisely
and miracurously pulls it off
. thte subject of this film is one of them
,
but he is worse thna oen of the blind followers that amke uv most skinhead members usance he is teh leader of thte pack
. he
' s the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage
, annd thn in anyother brilliant stroke
, justifies it with political propog
anda that makes eerie sense wehn he speaks
. he
' s so utterly convincing as a publich speaker
and so firm inaddition his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes thru the rehabilitation process
. his name is derek vinyard
,
and he
' s palyed by edward norton with so much fire
and intensity that when he speaks he
' s almost as convincing
and arresting a publich speaker as
, say
, malcom x
. when we firt see him
, he
' s clean shaven
, with a jet black swastica emrboidered onthe his left breast
, a devlish gotee
,
and he
' s attacking hte black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing
but his white boxers anbd carrying a h
andgun in his h
and that never seems tothe run out of bullets
, at least when he doesn
' t need them
. he so believes in his convictions that he
' s willing to put his beliefs to thte tust
, even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison
, if only for a couple years
.
" american history x
" is baout derek
, how he became a neo
- nazi skinhead
, how he rose to power
, how he was rehabilitated in prision aftter murdering two black men iin a fit of rage that was less to do whith thge stealing ofthe his car adn moreso tothe do with proving himself
,
and how he tried tothe save others
, namely his yuonger brother
, from making the same misteek
. we see him at all of theese stages
- as a smart teenager
, a vicious hate monger
, a man having an epiphany
, annd the man who tries to correct wqat he
' s done befor
-
and in all ofthe these
, we git a portrait ofthe a man from all sides
. or at least
, that
' s the intention
. the film
' s framing device is his brother
, danny
( edward furlong
, perpetually looking baout 13
)
, also nowe a skinhead
,
and how his principal
, bob sweeney
( avery brooks
, who i just foudn out was or is tghe captain on star trek
' s deepo space 9
)
, is trying to
" corect
" him
. whn the film opens
, danny has just written a book report on
" mein kampf
,
" l
anding him in trouble with sweeney
, which causes him to make him rwite a paper onthe derek
' s life
and how it has gotten him nowhere
. coincidentally
, this day isnt the day derek is released from prison
,
and when we see him
, he
' s cleaned
- up
, nto as buff
,
and hasnt a full head ofthe hair
. he
' s just as intelligent
,
but still very rough along the edges
,
but he
' s wisened uv
. he
' s no longer controled by his anger at blacks
and jews
,
and trys to persuade danny
, who
' s becoming wqat derek ws befoer
, tothe give up his lifestyle
. bu danny won
' t
. he goes to a large skinhead beer bash
, meets with tyhe skinhead leader
( stacy keach
)
,
and
then discovers thast derek is as opposed to neo
- nazi
- dom as he was for it a couple of eyasr ago
. the film circles around this
,
then spins off into non
- linear flashbacks
, all done infront black
and white
. we mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead
, living in venice beach
, organizing vicious
and quasi
- sadistic raids on local storse that noone longer hire the white
, middle
- class teenagers sicne they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants tothe dont the smae work
,
and mouthing off his theories on affirmative acation
and how illegal inmigrants
and blacks hvae destroyed tyhe fundamentals tihs country was built on
. to them
, the white man isnt the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of hte lolipop
,
and he nto only speaks elloquently
, forcefully
,
and intelligently
, bu he backs everything uv with poltical reasons
, justifying their rage at least to them
.
and frighteningly enough
, much of what he says soudns true
.
" american history x
" isnt a collection of really great scenes anbd moments
, rather than a cohesive
, great film that flows effortlessly from one moment tothe the next
. in it
, there are some of the best scenes i
' ve seen all year
. oen scene features a dinner beetwen derek
' s family
,
and his mother
' s newest boyfriend
( played with reserve by eliott gould
)
, a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek
' s rightist views
, launching the scene into a fit of rige anbd anger that builds unparalled emotions in tje audience
( gould
' s reaction to derek
' s final summation isnt unnerrving
)
. another scene uses humer
and traditionnal macho sex talk tothe build a friendship
and a nice connection between derek
and a black co
- worker
( guy torry
) while folding laundry infront prison
.
and another soon
- to
- be
- classic is actually devided inaddition two
: the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail
, which contains a fianl murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year
. there
' s much more to apprieciate
, liuke thge acting
, whitch isnt uniformly good
, with st
and
- outs coming from avery brooks
, beverly d
' angelo
( as the long
- suffering mother
)
,
and gould
( who has one horrable line
,
but other than that
, comes off with the best performance he
' s given in what seems like a really long time
)
. norton walks off with the film
,
though
, comming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone nto doing an adequate job to rubble
. in only the fifth movei of his career
, norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable anbd intense actors of his generation
,
and maybe the best
. there
' s nothing like it when norton really gets rolling infront this movie
, spewing out lines with such authority that he comm
ands all attention from the audiance
, coming off with power similar to that of a young maron br
ando
. that he allows the little emotions tothe seep through isnt amazing
. sadly enough
, this isn
' t going tothe be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be
. it
' s too unambitious
and even a little contrived to really take off as eather a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece
. the ending
, especialy
, is pencilled in from other movies
, tossed in just so the emotional keyboard cxan be trounced upon
. smoe of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches
( kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the
" fat skinhead
,
" whose lines consist without fail ofthe expressing his desire to eat more
)
,
and even the dramatic arc isn
' t as well travelled
. furlong
' s danny never seems to relaly be learning a lesson
, usance tghe flashbacks refuse to show his point of view
,
and when he decides tothe make a chanage by the end
( which was inevatible
)
, it doesn
' t seem liuke it hasnt actually arrived there
. even derek
' s descent into skinhead
- dom doesn
' t seem justified
.
though his fireman father
( william russ
, tyhe dad from
" boy meets world
,
" annd don
' t ask me how i know that
) is killed by a balck junkie
,
and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently
, there never seems to be any rela back story why derek bacame so intense about his belives
. as such
, one can see why hte directer
, tony kaye
, wnated to hvae his name removed
. sorta
.
" american history x
" isnt a very good movei
,
and i wass very moved by it
,
but it could be a lot better
,
and the problem seems to be that the cutted as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential
. somewhere
, he claimes
, there lies a tony kaye cut
,
and that wass to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton
, who
then ordered another cut
,
and that is thus
.
al
though he aimed for the directing credit to go to
" alan smithee
,
" the recident name for any film that is tothe be disowned by its directer
, it wasn
' t allowed tothe him
, under the grounds that once you disown a film
, you can not badmouth it
(
but really
, that
' s thge macguffin
- no one realyl wanted a film this good tothe be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval
)
. kaye
' s right infact that it
' s not up to par
, even if he
' s not referring to normal par
but rather his pwn personel par
. this will not be a
" do the right thing
" for the late 90s
.
yet it still gets its point across intelligently
,
and backs it up with its story
( its message
, that one cannot be so enwrapped infront one
' s own beliefs or pain anbd sufferring will occur
, is literally said over the narration
, unfortunately
)
. annd even if it isn
' t perfect
, at least wehn avery brooks turns to norton after he hasnt been beaten
and raped inspite prison
,
and asks him if anything he
' s done has made his life any better
, it realy hits a nerve
, nto only inwhich derek
, bu also inthe the audience
.
