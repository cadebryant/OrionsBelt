onot
: some may consider portions of the folowing text to be spoilers
. be forewarned
. the teaser trailers forthe my best friend
' s wedding scarsely gavey reason for hope
- it looked like the sort of goofy
, light
- hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight
, bu little more
; i
' d frankly rarley seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often
. it was thne tothe both my surprise
and my delight to find that my best friend
' s wedding was such a success
- a strong
, bouyant romantic
- comedy with smoe decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects
, featuring a triumphant performance from ms
. roberts
. the heroine ofthe my best friend
' s wedding is julianne potter
( julia roberts
)
, a successful new york rstaurant critic
,
and we open tyhe film with a whimsical revelation tothe her editor george downes
( rupert everett
) that years ago
, she had made a pact with her dear best friend
and ex
- lover michael o
' neal
( dermot mulroney
)
, a sportscar writer
, tht if they both hadn
' t married by the time htey reached 28
, they had promised to marry each otehr
. both julianne
and michael are both single
, ofthe course
,
and when george inquires about michael
' s age
, julianne realizes that he
' s mere weeks away from his 28th birthday
,
and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day
.
however
, she finds herself even more distraught when michael
' s call isnt inspite regards to his impending marrige to heiress kimmy wallace
( cameron diaz
)
,
and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding
, julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael
,
and resolves to break up the wedding
and steal the groom by any means necessary
. the setup for my best firend
' s wedding
, thn
, is a fairly conventional one
,
and in many ways the film
' s storyline is formulaic
-
but only to a certain extent
: the film was directed by p
. j
. hogan
, whose first feature
, muriel
' s wedding
, had quite an offbeat tone forthe a traditional uplifting ugly
- duckling story
,
and the same holds true forthe my best friend
' s wedding
, which confidently combines traditional romantic
- comedy elements iwth a really eccentric sense of humour
. the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems claerly the influence of mr
. hogan
. for exmaple
, ther
' s a heartfelt
, emotional exchange betwen julianne annd michael lite inaddition the film
- with a trio of teenagers
, inhaling helium
and sounding eveyr bit like alvin
and the chipmunks
, harmonizing in the background
. my best freind
' s wedding opens witht an inpsired opening credit sequence wich sets the tone for the film
,
and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect
- it could almsot be argued thgat this film isnt nearly as much ofthe a musical as woody allen
' s everyone says i lveo you
; i
' d even assert it
' s a more succsessfull oen
. my best freind
' s wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its charachters as well
. in a typical romantic
- comedy
, kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty
, conniving ice queen
, anbd the audiance would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps
; thsi film isnt smarter tahn taht
- here
, kimmy isnt sweet
, sincere
,
and innocent
; julianne even admits at noe point tyhat had she not resolved to utterly distroy kimmy
' s life
, she
' d actaully liuke her too
. the george character is almsot a staple ofthe reccent film
- the homosexual male friend ofthe yhe heroine who acts as a confidant
and provides the guiding voice of reason
-
but in my best friend
' s wedding
, he gets to have a playful
, mischievous
and charming personality
. throughout the film
, the formulaisms one oftenly sees is rumatic
- comedy are given littel twists
, annd thte result is a film which is compelling all the way tothe its somewhat unorthodox conclusion
. there is a lot of smart writing in the well
- pased screenplay by ronald bass
; we
' re given four interesting
, vivid
,
and likeable characters
, with some ogod dialogue
and some genuinely charming
and touching moments
. my best friend
' s wedding marks a strong carreer rebound fo julia roberts
, who turns in a top
- nitch
, confident
and reassured performance as julianne
. thsi isn
' t the sort of role one usually associates with ms
. roberts
- hte julianne character
' s neurotic
, fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role
- bu ms
. roberts works wonderfully in the film
and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here
, remaning compelling adn empathetic to the audeince
, if not entirely sympathetic
, even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable
. even better tahn ms
. roberts
though is cameron diaz
, who turns in a shining performance in my best freind
' s weddding
. wtih a smile which lights up the screen
, she effectively conveys kimmy
' s insecurity
and utter sweetness in an endearing manner
,
and never hits a false note in the film
. she even sings
- i won
' t soon forget her charming serenade of
" i just don
' t know whta to dont with myself
"
. rupert everett is given a vrey juicy role as george
,
and he mkaes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid
and most memorable in the film
. his george is a bit of a devilish rogue
, entirely affable
,
and mr
. everett
' s performance is a delight to watch
; he
' s claerly having fun
,
and his joy is infectuous
. dermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role
- unlike the other characters inwhich the film
, he
' s not given a lot to dont
,
but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms
. roberts
and mr
. mulroney
, adn consequently the longst
anding friendship between his michael character
and the julianne charcter always seemed completely au
thentic
. when julia roberts
' lustre began to fade
,
and she was usurped from her title as
" amercia
' s sweetheart
" by s
andra bullock
, i thougth it was a canny career move on her part tothe take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins annd everyone says i love you to raise her profile
. while that didn
' t quite work out
, it
' s near
- certain that her successfull return tothe the genre which made her a big star back inwhich 1990
, the rumatic
- comedy
, iwll once agina raise her ante in the hollywood game
. my best firend
' s wedding marks a return tothe form for ms
. roberts
, anbd cements p
. j
. hogan
' s reputation as a skilled directer of comedy
.
