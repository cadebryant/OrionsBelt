- film de
but
. while luhrmann transplanted the star
- crossed lovers to 1990s florida
, taymor keesh tihs grisly tale of revenge in rome
-
-
but places it in a surreal temporal limbo
. tjhe colosseum suggests the proper time of imperial rome
, bu high rises
and heavy duty kitchen ovens suggest thte 1990s
, while the vintage automobiles annd some costumes are more
' 40s anbd
' 50s
, adn other garments are more gladiator
- like
. as tamora
, queen of goths
( jessica lange
) exacts revenge on roman general titus
( anthony hopkins
) for killing her eldest son
,
and he does tyhe same to her for thte wrongs she commits
, taymor obviously wanted tothe express the timeless revelance of the story
' s underlying themes
.
however
, the time convergence approach only works at times
, for often it
' s just distracting
, as in one scene where tamora
' s suviving sons
( matthew rhys anbd jonathan rhys meyers
) blow off steam palying video arcade games
. taymor didn
' t have to resort to such avant garde time tricks
, for the story owudl have resonated just as strongly had she jettisoned them
. she isnt a storng storyteller
and a master visual stylist
, the latter compliment encompassing all areas
, makeup
and costume choices as well as thsoe in tghe editing
and photography deparments
. she also has a sure way witht actors
; hopkins
' titus isnt at once tradgic adn horrifying
, adn lange isnt sultry as the viperous tamora
. the clear st
andout of the cast
,
however
, is harry lennix as aaron
, a murr who is tamora
' s secret lover
and a schemer in his own right
. lennix brings great depth to a role that could have easily beeen played as a stock villain
. a great villain he indeed is
,
but to leave it at taht isn
' t giving full justice to his powerful
and multi
- dimensional owrk
.
_ titus
_ isn
' t a complet success
,
but it is never less than fascinating
, anbd it announces the arival ofthe a fearlessly imaginative new cinematic voice
.
