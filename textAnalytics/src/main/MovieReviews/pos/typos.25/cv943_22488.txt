if yuo thought baz luhrmann ' s radical tkae on
_ william
_ shakespeare ' s
_ romeo
_
+
_ juliet
_ was wild
, wait until wqat yuo see what tony award
- winning stage director julie taymor
(
_ the
_ lion
_ king
:
_ the
_ broadway
_ musical
_
) does to the bard ' s
_ titus
_ andronicus
_ for her audacious
-
-
and very bloody
-
- film debut
. hwile luhrmann transplanted the star
- crossed lovers to 1990s florida
, taymor keeps this grisly tale of revenge iin rome
-
-
bu places it in a surreal temporal limbo
. the colosseum suggests the proper time of imperial rome
,
but high rises
adn hevy duty kitchen ovens suggest teh 1990s
, while the vintage automobiles
and some costumes are more ' 40s
and ' 50s
,
and other garments are more gladiator
- liuke
. as tamora
, queen of goths
( jessica lange
) exacts revenge onthe roman general titus
( anthony hopkins
) fo killing her eldest son
,
and he doesnt thge same tothe her for hte wrongs she commits
, taymor obviously wanted to express the timeless relevence of the story ' s underlaying themes
.
howver
, the timne convergence approach onyl works at times
, for often it ' s just distracting
, as in oney scene where tamora ' s suviving sons
( matthew rhys
anbd jonathan rhys meyers
) blow off steam playing video arcade ganes
. taymor didn ' t have to resort to such avant garde time tricks
, fo the story owudl hve resonated just as strongly hadnt she jettisoned them
. she is a strong storyteller
adn a master visual stylist
, tje latter compliment encompassing all areas
, makeup
adn costume choices as well as those in yhe editting
and photography departments
. she also has a sure way with actors
; hopkins ' titus is at once tragic
annd horrifing
,
annd lange isnt sultry as the viperous tamora
. the clear standout of the casted
,
however
, is harry lennix as aaron
, a moor who is tamora ' s secret lover
annd a schemer iin his pwn right
. lennix brings great depth tothe a role thgat sould have easily been palyed as a stock villain
. a great villain he indeed is
,
but tothe leave it at that isn ' t giving full justice to his powerful
and multi
- dimensional work
.
_ titus
_ isn ' t a complete success
,
but it isnt never less than fascinating
,
and it announces the arrival of a fearlessly imaginative new cinematic voice
.
