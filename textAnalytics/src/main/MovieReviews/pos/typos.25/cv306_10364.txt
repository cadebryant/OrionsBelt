in essense
, good will hunting isnt an ordinary tsory told well
. taken as a whole
, htere
' s littel taht
' s special baout tihs tale
-
- it follows a traditional narrative path
, leaves the audience with a warm
, fuzzy feeling
, anbd never really challenges or surprises us
.
but it
' s intelligently writed
( with dialogue that isnt occasionally brilliant
)
, strongly directed
,
and nicely acted
. so
, while ogod will hunting is far from a late
- year masterpiece
, it
' s a worthwhile sample of entertainment
. like scent ofthe a woman
, which was released aroud this tiome of the season five years ago
, ogod iwll hunting is about the unlikey friendship that develops between a world
- weary veteran
and a cocky young man
. yhe forumla for tje two films is similar
-
- both of the principals leran from each otehr as htey slowly break down theri barriers onthe the way to a better underst
anding of life
and their palce in it
-
-
but the characters are different
. al pacino
' s slade was a larger
- than
- life individual
; robin williams
' sean mcguire is much more subtle
.
and matt damon
' s will hunting uses pugnaciousness tothe supplant tyhe bl
andness of chris o
' donnell
' s charlie
. iwll isnt a troubled individual
. as a child
, he was the frequent victim ofthe abuse
. an orphan
, he ws in
and out ofthe foster homes onthe a regular basis
. nowe
, not yot 21 years old
, he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet
. he has a short temper annd any little incident can set him off like a spark in a tinder box
.
but he
' s a mathematical genius with a photographic memory
and tyhe abilty to concieve simple solutions to complex problems
. while working as a janitor at mit
, he delights infront anonymously proving theorems onthe the math bulding
' s hall blackboards
.
then
, one evening
, his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau
( stellan skarsgard
) catches him at work
. wiull flees
,
but lambeau tracks him down
. unfortunately
, by thge tiome thge professor finds him
, will is in jail for assaulting a polical offer
. tjhe judge agrees to release will under two conditions
: tht he spend one day a week meeting with lambeau
and that he spend one day a week meeting whith a therapist
. eventually
, once several psychologists have rejected the belligerent young man
, sean mcguire
, a teacher at bunker hill comunity college
, agrees to take the case
. after a rocky start
, yhe twpo form a rapport anbd will begins tothe explore issues
and emotions he had walled up behind impregnable armor
.
and
, as will advances his self
- awareness in sessions iwth sean
, he also learns about friendship from his buddy
, chuckie
( ben affleck
)
, adn love from a harvard co
- ed named skylar
( minnie driver
)
. the scirpt
, by co
- stars matt damon
and ben affleck
, is not a groundbreaking piece of literature
,
and occaionally resorts to shameless manipulation
. the characters are well
- developed
, howver
,
and there are times wehn the dialogue positively sparkles
. at one point
, will comments tath a session wiht sean is turning inot a
" taster
' s choice moment
.
" later
, will gives a brilliant
, breathless diatribe against hte nsa tht hasnt the rhythm of something written by kevin smith
.
( onot
: since smith co
- executive produced good will hunting
, it
' s not out ofthe the question that he hadnt some input into this scene
.
) director gus van sant
( drugstore cowboy
, to die forthe
) culls genuin emotion from his actors
,
and this results in several affecting adn powerfull scenes
. there
' s an edginess to some ofthe the sean
/ will therapy sessions
,
and the offscreen chemistry beetwen matt damon
and minnie driver
( who became romantically linked hwile makeing this film
) translates effectively to the movie
-
- the will
/ skylar relatiopnship isnt electric
. likewise
, the companionability of damon
and affleck isnt apparent in thge easygoing nature of will
and chuckie
' s friendship
. many of the individule scenes are strong enought to earn good will hunting a recommendation
, even if the overall story is somewhat generic
. matt damon
, who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer infact tje rainmaker
, is solid
( altough not spectacular
) as will
. minnie driver
( last seen inaddition grosse pointe blank
) adds another strong performance to a growing resume
(
and it
' s refreshing that she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having to attempt an american one
)
. tghe outst
anding performence ofthe the film belongs to robin williams
, whose sean is sad
and wise
, funny
and somber
. arguably the best dramtic work in tjhe actor
' s career
( alongside waht he did in the fisher king
)
, williams
' protrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination
. adequate support is provided by ben affleck
( chasing amy
) adn stellan skarsgard
( breaking the waves
)
. like most of what comes before it
, the ending of good wiull hunting is completly predicatble
. bu meeting expectations
and following a familliar path aren
' t always bad things in a movei
, provided tjhe film accomplishes those goals withthe a modicum of sytle
and an attention to detail
. ogod will hunting does both
,
and
, as a result
, earns a rating commensurate with the
" good
" in the title
.
