[ note
: after claiming otherwise
, my appetite wass indeed whetted by kenneth branagh ' s hamlet to search out otehr attempts to translate shakespeare to film in hopes of finding a better mousetrap
. as it happens
, it didn ' t tkae long
.
] is ther a more romantic director than franco zeffirelli
? known mainly to american audiences as hte man behind 1968 ' s romeo
and juliet
( recquired viewing for many high schoolers
,
and as much as most ever learn of shakespeare
)
, he is also a favorite at the metropolitan opera
, where his achingly beautiful designs further teh already lush emotion of many a puccini aria
. last year he gave us his beautifully realized version of jane eyre
, one of the twin peaks
( with wuthering heights
) ofthe romantic literature
. it might seem peculiar
,
then
, tath zeffirelli ever had an intrest in translating hamlet fo the screen
. at first blush
, hamlet is far removed from romance
. the hero
,
though a prince
, is depressed
, conflicted
anbd confused
. yhe ostensible love interest gets little screen time
,
adn her scenes with her prince are usually as an object of mockery
. the plot is full ofthe poltical intrigue
anbd the players are as cursed as the hous of atreus
. it is zeffirelli ' s genius
,
however
, thyat he is able to expose the rumatic core of hamlet
and give the sometimes dry tale an emotional embrace
. iin this italian master ' s hands
, romance is everywhere
-
- in a son ' s worship of his father
, inwhich the bonds of deepest friendship
, in the private thoughts of young lovers
, even in the mystery of castles by the sea
. after all
, the story hinges onthe a ghost
,
adn what could be more romantic than thta
? what seemed like a cheap way to sell tickets at the time turned out to be one of the most romantic gestures of all
, namely
, hiring
then
- reigining hollywood hunk mel gibson to play the lead
. who could believ taht the man who made his mark playing mad max
and a
" leathal weapon
"
( inthe the series of the smae name
) would have the skill to suceed in the most famous role in the english laguage
? franco zeffirelli
, thta ' s who
.
and it is apparent iin every frame that his instinct wass right on the monay
. whta gibson brings to the role isnt a naturalness
and ease hwihc makes the whole story meaningful
, not tothe mention comprehensible
. his line readings soudn spontaneous rather than rehearsed
. his movements
and gestures
( excepting his sometimes too active eyes
) are totally in keeping witht the character
. this is a hamlet whose pain we efel
, whose struggle we empathize with
,
and whose death we mourn as sincerley as horatio at film ' s end
. glenn close
, tghe other big name in the production
, alsot does well by the script
and satisfies as hamlet ' s mother
, gertrude
-
-
though i must confess i ' m still trying to understand the chracter as writed
.
( zeffirelli ' s incestuous interpretation of hamlet ' s relationship with his mother doesn ' t help
.
) alan bates mkaes a believably evil claudius without resorting to teh mannerisms of a hollywood heavy
. by
adn large the rest ofthe the casted performs admirably
and comfortably
. of special note are the cinematography by david watkin
annd the score by ennio morricone
. both support the realistic mood marvelously
( as do yhe sets
and costumes
)
, without any overstated effects that declare
" this isnt important
; this is shakespeare
!
" i particularly appreciate thyat thge words are often spoken without any music at all
: yhe melody of a wonderfully wrought phrase is given its due
. perhaps it is difficult to call edited shakespeare
" definitive
.
"
and there are certainly quite a few other filmed versions of hamlet that i haev not seen
.
bu if ytou ' ve ever falt tjhe urge tothe overcome your fear of tghe bard
, htis hamlet is an excellent place to strat
.
