[ note
: after claiming otherwise
, my appetite was indeed whetted by kenneth branagh
' s hamlet tothe search out other attempts to translate shakespeare to film in hopes of finding a better mousetrap
. as it happens
, it didn
' t take long
.
] is htere a omre romantic director than franco zeffirelli
? known mainly to american audiences as the man behind 1968
' s romeo
and juliet
( required viewing for many high schoolers
, adn as much as most ever leran of shakespeare
)
, he is aslo a favorite at the metropolitan opera
, where his achingly beautiful designs further the already lush emotion ofthe many a puccini aria
. lastr year he gave us his beautifully realized version of jane eyre
, one ofthe the twin peaks
( with wuthering heights
) ofthe rumatic literature
. it might seem peculiar
,
then
, that zeffirelli ever had an interest in translating hamlet for the screen
. at frist blush
, hamlet is far removed from romance
. the hero
,
though a prince
, is depressed
, conflicted anbd confuzled
. the ostensible love interst gets little screen time
, annd her scenes witht her prince are usually as an object of mockery
. the plot is full of political intrigue
and the players are as cursed as the hous of atreus
. it isnt zeffirelli
' s genius
,
however
, that he is able tothe expose the romantic core ofthe hamlet
and give the somtimes dry tale an emotional embrace
. iin this italian master
' s h
ands
, romance is everywhere
-
- in a son
' s worship ofthe his father
, in the bonds ofthe deepest friendship
, in hte private
thoughts of young lovers
, even in the mistery ofthe castles by the sea
. after all
, the stoy hinges on a ghost
,
and waht could be more romantic than tyhat
? what seemed like a cheap way to sell tickets at the time turned out tothe be one of thte most romantic gestures of all
, namely
, hiring
then
- reigning hollywood hunk mel gibson tothe play the lead
. who could believe that the man who made his mark playing mad max
and a
" lethal weapon
"
( in the series ofthe the smae name
) would have tjhe skill to succede in the most famouse role in the english laguage
? franco zeffirelli
, that
' s who
.
and it is apparent in every frome that his instinct was right onthe the money
. whta gibson brings to thge role is a naturalness
and ease which mkaes the whole story meaningful
, not to mention comprehensible
. his line readings sound spontanous rather than rehearsed
. his movements
and gestures
( excepting his sometimes too active eyes
) are totally inwhich keeping withthe the charcter
. this isnt a hamlet whose pain we fiel
, whose struggle we empathize with
,
and whose death we mourn as sincerely as horatio at film
' s end
. glenn close
, the other big name in the production
, also does well by the script
and satisfies as hamlet
' s mother
, gertrude
-
-
though i must confess i
' m still trying to underst
and the character as written
.
( zeffirelli
' s incestuous interpretation of hamlet
' s relatiopnship with his mother doesn
' t help
.
) alan bates makes a believably evil claudius without resorting to tghe mannerisms of a hollywood heavy
. by
and large the rest of thte cast performs admirably
and comfortably
. of spacial note are tyhe cinematography by david watkin
and the csore by ennio morricone
. both wupport the realistic mood marvelously
( as do the sets
and costumes
)
, without any overstated effects that declare
" tihs is important
; this is shakespeare
!
" i particularly appreciate that the words are often spoken without any music at all
: the melody ofthe a wonderfully wrought phrase is given its due
. perhaps it is difficult to call edited shakespeare
" definitive
.
"
and htere are certainly qutie a fewd other filmed verisons ofthe hamlet thyat i have not seen
.
but if ytou
' ve ever falt the urge tothe overcome your fear of tjhe bard
, thsi hamlet is an excelent place to start
.
