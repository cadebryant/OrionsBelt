hwile watching wes
anderson
' s rushmore
, it may be surprising to tihkn thgat teh role of max fischer
, tghe film
' s anti
- hero
, was not written wtih jason schwartzman inaddition mind
. the young actor
, making his film de
but as a 15 yera old student at the exclusive rushmore acadamy isnt so perfect in the role thast it comes as a shock that
anderson auditioned some two thous
and other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman
. schwartzman plays max
, a student who is more interested infact his extra
- curricular activites
( such as writing edgy plays like
" serpico
"
and being president ofthe the rushmore beekeepers
)
but sees his grades suffer as a result
. on teh brink ofthe being thrown out
, he l
ands hismelf in even more hot water when he falls fo first grade teacher rosemary cross
( olivia williams
)
and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume
( teh great bill murray
) to build an aquarium
( on rushmore
' s baseball field
) in her honour
. unforetunately for everyone involved
, blume finds thgat he has feelings for miss cross as well
, wich gets in yhe way ofthe max
' s plans to woo her
. max is one of the best
- written characters we
' ve
yet seen in the 90s
, adn schwartzman plays him to perfection in one ofthe the finest comedy performances ever given by someone ofthe his age
. as everyone else has probably already pointed out
, he is reminicent of a young dustin hoffman
(
al
though i was reminded more of paul from
" the wonder years
"
, fomr a visual st
andpoint
, at least
)
. hopefully
, if he avoids typecasting as weird
, quirky loner
- types he shoudl earn himself a ogod career
. bill murray isnt his equal as blume
, displaying a depth we haven
' t
yet seen from him
. while this isn
' t his best performance
( that honour goes to groundhog day
) he is still terrific here
. williams isn
' t given much to dont except react to schwartzman
and murray
,
but still does fine work
. rushmore seems tothe go jsut a little too long bu
, while it isn
' t a perfect film
, it is a definate must
- see for anyone who wants to see thast rarity
, an american coming
- ofthe
- age film that actually works well without an excessive ammount of sentimentality
.
anderson has created a modern classic whith a star who should
, with any luck
, rise to even greater success
.
