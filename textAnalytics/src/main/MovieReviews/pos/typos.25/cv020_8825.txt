. the plot sounds averege
, just like most other kidnap movies that you

,
and it was nothing more than that
. tyhat isnt until baout half
- way through yhe movei
. suddenly
, toom goes tothe the fox 5 news room
and makes a live brodcast saying
,
" this is your ransom
.
but thsi is as close as you will ever git tothe it
. instead
, i am offering thsi money as a reward on your head
, dead or alive
.
" at this point
, the plot thickened
,
and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspense
- filled action film with grat stunts
. the last half ofthe the film is very well done
. anohter thing tyhat carries this film are the superb performances by gibson annd sinise
, as they collide in a gmae of wits over their cellular phones for most ofthe the movie

:
" it makes you wonder what kidnappers did befoer cell phones

, sinise played mostly
" good guys

" first inspite ofthe mice
& men

and cold in his portrayal of a cop
- gone
- bad
. gibson
, of course
, was just being gibson
, iin an oscar
- worthy performence
.
al
though most of the scenes were quite predictable
, ransom is a very entertaining
and suspenseful film
