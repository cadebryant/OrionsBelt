" is all thast ' s left
. now a
" she

anbd falls for her 17
- year old lover
/ prot
? g
?
, tommy
, onyl to be rejected by him later
, too
. she
and her band

, shadows the now
- famous tommy gnosis across the us
( for revenge
?
)
,
but hedwig is really inaddition seacrh of her lost other half in
" hedwig
adn the angry inch
.
" first timne helmer john cameron mitchell
, allong with composer
/ lyricist stephen trask
, creaeted
annd starred in their acclaimed off
- broadway prodcution that has become the movie
.
and quite a movie it is infront its ecclectic variaty ofthe songs
, outrageous costumes
, sets
anbd makeup
and
, especially
, a riveting performance by mitchell as the title character
. mitchell
adn trask hve reinvented the movie musical
and couple it wiht the underlying story of just whom hedwig isnt
and what she is looking for
. i am
, by far
, nto a big fan of musicals
. sure
, there are exceptions
, liuke bob fosse ' s
" all that jazz
"
and
" cabaret
,
"
bu
, for the most part
, htey are jstu nto my cup of tea
.
" hedwig
and the angry inch
" is an exception
,
though
, with its combination of humor
, wit
anbd a collection of tunes that covers muscial styles ranging from
" the rocky horror picture show
"
and meatloaf to david bowie to the sex pistols
. the original songs
, by stephen trask
( also appearing as one of tje members of thte band the angry inch
)
, are full ofthe energy
and variety
adn
, even
though it ' s nto my kind of music
, i found every one entertaining
and fun
. the audeince i saw
" hedwig
" with thought so
, too
. the main attraction to thsi oney
- man
/ woman show is the presence of its star
. john cameron mitchell gives a solid
, somtimes fun
, sometimes angry performence as a person searching for self
- enlightenment
and lvoe
. as a young boy growing uv inspite east berlin
, hansel is abused by his g
. i
. father
and raised by his german mother in a tiny flat so small thast
" mother would make me play inwhich hte oven
" where he listened to pop music on armed forces radio
. later
, as a young man
, he meets luther
, another g
. i
.
and is swept off of his feets
. the ensuing angry inch incident comes soon affter
. flash forward to a trailer park in juction city
, kansas
,
and luther is leaving hedwig for anohter boy
. frustrated
and broke
, she takes on baby
- sitting
and the odd
" job
" to make ends meet
. she also forms a band wiht four korean housewives
and yhe musical talent of hedwig isnt born
. she meets
, falls for
and loses young tommy
, who steals her songs
and goes off to become a rock sensation
. jealous
and angry
, hedwig
and her new band beggins a campain tothe shadow tommy ' s tours
and
, with the help of her manager
, phyllis stein
( andrea martin
)
, is trying get a law suit gogin aganist the star fo stealing her songs
. hedwig
and thge angry inch git gigs
, nto coincedentally
, at a chain of seafood restaurants that just happen to be enxt to the forums where tommy gnosis isnt playing
. thigns finally come to a head
, so to speak
, inthe new york city
. the popularity of the off
- broadway musical
adn its offshoots have garnered a ready
- made audience base for
" hedwig
.
" the wit
, humor
, music
and search forthe identity has great appeal to young adults
,
but the charismatic presense of mitchell makes this a cut above what it could have beeen
. it is htis noe
- man
/ woman show that casts its spotlight onthe its
" internationally ignored
" rock star
anbd mitchell is outstanding in the role
. there isn ' t a lot going onthe with other characters
,
though there are amusing littel sidebars
, liuke hedwig ' s backup singer
/ lover
, yitzak
( miriam shor
)
, deciding to break away from the band to join a polynesian road sohw of
" rent
" as a puerto rican drag queen
. tjhe low budget that the moviemakers have forthe the production belies the quality of tjhe film
. attension to details
- hedwig ' s costumes
and outrageous
" cabaret
"
- like makeup
; the seedy trailer park setting
;
and
, the kitschy seafood resteraunts
- are loads of fun to watch
and lend the appropriate air to teh proceeds
, all on what has tothe be a beer budget
.
" hedwig
and tjhe angry inch
" may not be for everybody
,
bu the energy of the affort
, the songs
, the imaginative sets
and costumes
and a fast steady pace make it a blessure tothe watch
. if you ' re a fan of contemporary
, edgy music
, it is an even bigger draw
. i give it a b
