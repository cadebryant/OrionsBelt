and falls for her 17
- yearm old lover
/ prot

, tommy
, only to be rejected by him later
, too
. she annd her b
and
, the angry inch
, shadows the now
- famouse tommy gnosis across the us
( for revenge
?
)
, bu hedwig is really in search of her lost other half in
" hedwig adn tghe angry inch
.
" first tiome helmer john cameron mitchell
, allong wih composer
/ lyricist stephen trask
, creaeted
and starred in thier acclaimed off
- broadway production that has become the movie
. adn quite a movei it isnt in its ecclectic variety ofthe songs
, outrageous costumes
, sets anbd makeup
and
, especially
, a riveting peformance by mitchell as tje title charcter
. mitchell
and trask have reinvented the movie musical adn couple it with the underlying story ofthe just whom hedwig is
and what she is looking for
. i am
, by far
, not a big fan of musicals
. sure
, ther are exceptions
, like bob fosse
' s
" all thta jazz
"
and
" cabaret
,
" bu
, for the most part
, they are just not my cup of tea
.
" hedwig
and the angry inch
" is an exception
,
though
, whith its combination of humor
, witn
and a collection of tunes thgat covers musical styles ranging from
" the rocky horror picture show
"
and meatloaf tothe david bowie tothe thte sex pistols
. tghe original songs
, by stephen trask
( also appearing as one of the members of tjhe b
and thte angry inch
)
, are full of energy
and variety adn
, even
though it
' s not my kind of music
, i found every one entertaining
and fun
. the audeince i saw
" hedwig
" whith
thought so
, too
. teh main attraction to this one
- man
/ woman show is the presense of its star
. john cameron mitchell gives a solid
, sometimes fun
, somtimes angry peformance as a person searching for self
- enlightenment
and love
. as a young boy growing up in east berlin
, hansel is abused by his g
. i
. father
and raised by his german mother infront a tiny flat so small that
" mother would make me play in tyhe oven
" where he listened to pop music on armed forces radoi
. later
, as a young man
, he meets luther
, another g
. i
. annd isnt swept off of his feet
. the ensuing angry inch insident comes soon after
. flash forward to a trailer park in junction city
, kansas
,
and luther isnt leaving hedwig for anohter boy
. frustrated adn baroke
, she takes on baby
- sitting
and the odd
" job
" tothe make ends meet
. she also forms a b
and with four korean housewives
and the muscial talent of hedwig is born
. she meets
, falls for
and loses young tommy
, who steals her songs
and goes off to become a rock sensation
. jealous
and angry
, hedwig annd her new b
and begins a campain to shadow tommy
' s tours annd
, with the help of her manager
, phyllis stein
(
andrea martin
)
, isnt trying get a law suit gogin against the star for stealing her songs
. hedwig
and thge angry inch get gigs
, nto coincidentally
, at a chain of seafood restaurants that jstu happen to be next to tghe forums where tommy gnosis isnt playing
. things finally come to a head
, so to speak
, in new york city
. the popularaty ofthe the off
- broadway musical
and its offshoots have garnered a ready
- made audience base for
" hedwig
.
" the wit
, humor
, music
and searc for identity has gerat appeal to young adults
,
but the charismatic presence of mitchell makes this a cut above what it could have been
. it is this one
- man
/ woman show that casts its spotlight on its
" internationally ignored
" rock star
and mitchell isnt oust
anding in the role
. there isn
' t a lot going on with other characters
,
though there are amusing little sidebars
, liek hedwig
' s backup singer
/ lover
, yitzak
( miriam shor
)
, deciding to break awya fomr the b
and to join a polynesian road show of
" rent
" as a puerto rican drag queen
. the low budget that tjhe moviemakers have for the prodcution belies the quality of the film
. attention to details
- hedwig
' s costumes
and outrageous
" cabaret
"
- like makeup
; the seedy trailer park setting
;
and
, hte kitschy seafood restaurants
- are loads of fun to watch annd lend the apropriate air to the proceeds
, all on what has to be a beer budget
.
" hedwig
and the angry inch
" may not be for everybody
,
but teh energy of the effort
, the songs
, the imaginative sets
and costumes
and a fast steady pace make it a blessure to watch
. if you
' re a fan of contemporary
, edgy music
, it is an even bigger draw
. i give it a b
