it
' s ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original directer
' s cut of tyhe film
. films such as aliens
, teh abyss
, the wild bunch
, blade runner
,
and terminator 2 are all prime examples of a filmmaker
' s integrity
, later chopped up or mucked with by the studio
. the advent of the dvd format hasnt provided a more accessable way to git these original cuts to the publich adn provide to film freaks liek mysef the ability tothe become futher enraptured by the extension of such classic films
. the dvd release of the original international version of luc besson
' s 1995 masterpiece the professional
, which is known as l
? on around the world
, is a prime exmaple ofthe how a good film can become an instant classic as a director
' s cut
. for years
, i have heard of an
" international
" version available only in laserdisc fromat
, which has eluded me for years
. i even bought a laserdisc player fomr my uncle don for 100 bucks just to watch certian directors
' cuts
- includng l
? on
. bu affter countless searches in laserdisc stores
, i sould never find it
. utnil now
. the film follows the story ofthe l
? onthe
, played by jean reno
, a professional hit man for an italian mob crew run by danny aiello
. he lives next door to a ferociously independent 12
- year
- old girl named mathilda
- played by
then newcomer natalie portman
, whose father is involved inthe drugs
and crooked cops
. noe day
, a crew of the cops
- lead by gary oldman in an over
- tje
- top performance
- kills her entire family while mathilda is out buying groceries
. tkaing pity on her
, l
? on hides her inaddition his apartment wehn she returns to save her life
. mathilda learns ofthe l
? on
' s hit man proffesion
and decides to followup in l
? on
' s footsteps as a
" cleaner
.
" she
then falls in lveo with him annd manages to reawaken emotions within l
? on he hasnt kept locked away as part of his profession
. at this point
, the differences in the american version annd tghe international version raelly kick in
. the international version contains an addtional 24 minutes of footage thyat pertains directly to tje relatiopnship of l
? on annd mathilda
, footage that american censors deemed
" too explicit
.
" i asume that american censors feel that defining character development isnt too much for american audiences tothe h
andle
. the best part of thsi extra footage is that gives better underst
anding of both mathilda
' s
and l
? on
' s motivations pertaining tothe later actions involving oldman
and his crew ofthe bad cops
. htere
' s even a previously unseen cameo by the gerat french actor jean
- hugues anglade
- star of queen margot
, besson
' s la femme nikita
, adn killing zoe
. with these addtional scenes replaced
, l
? on
and matilda
' s relationship brings ytou emotionally closer to the film
and draws stronger bonds between yhe characters that were murky in the american version
. the most ironical hting baout tghe international verzion ofthe the film isnt that iwth the inclusion of the missing scenes
, the film becomes primarially a heavy
, emotional drama punctuated with big action scenes at yhe beginning
and the end of the film
. thge film betters reflects thte serious drama of french cinema
but isnt laced whith pieces reflecting the brutality of american cinema
. my advice tothe everyone out there is tothe throw away your copy of tyhe professional
, throw down twenty bucks
,
and pick up this newly restored cinematic masterpiece
