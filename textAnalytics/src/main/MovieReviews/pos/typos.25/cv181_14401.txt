i saw simon birch in a basicaly sold out theather
, on a sunday afternoon
. when teh movei was over
and hte audience wass exiting
, i didn ' t hear one negative comment
,
and i didn ' t have any to offer
. simon birch is primarily baout the friendship ofthe two twelve year old boys
, simon
( ian michael smith
)
and joe
( jospeh mazzello
)
,
and waht destiny holds fo both of them
. simon is a dwarf
, who wass nto supposed to lastest thru teh night aftter birth due to a weak heart
. surprisingly
, he does
,
and now constantly reminds everyone that he is a living miricle
. simon thinks god hasnt a plan for him
, a purpose for his life
,
and his condidtion
, he jsut doesn ' t know what
. joe is an illegitmate child
( referred to both comically
anbd dramatically thoughout teh film as a bastard
)
, who ' s mom
( ashley judd
) won ' t tell him who his father is
. simon has more than just dwarfism as a probelm
, the people in the town don ' t really like him
, baceause he isn ' t
" natural
"
. even his own parents don ' t care about him
,
and are disappointed they didn ' t have a
" normal
" son
. he isnt also harassed in church by tyhe local pastor
, rev
. russell
( david strathairn
)
anbd simon ' s chain smoking sunday school teacher played by jan hooks
. the only person
, other than joe
, that really cares for simon isnt joe ' s mom
, who he also looks uv to as a mother
. it would be just simon ' s luck
, that he would accidentally kills joe ' s mom
, something you are told at the beggining of the movei
. joe
, now motherless as well as fatherless
, feels the need to find out who his rela father isnt
. with the help ofthe ben
( oliver platt
)
, yhe local drama teacher
and joe ' s mom ' s current boyfriend
( before her death
)
, he will attemp to locate his dad
anbd git in a little trouble onthe tjhe way
. most of thsi trouble isnt laugh out loud funny
,
altough not all ofthe it is
. simon will alsot look for god ' s plan for him
,
although he loses a little faith along the way
. starring in the first
(
annd last
) five mintues of the film is hollywood ' s newest dramatic ctor
, jim carrey
. jim plays the adult version ofthe joe
anbd does a impressive job starting yhe film off
,
and
then tying it up just right
. this is the first charater jim has palyed that is not over the top in anyway
,
annd he does a commendable job
. simon birch is written
and directed by mark steven johnson
, this is his first film as director
,
but he has writen sevral films
, incuding the grumpy old men sories
. he does an outstanding writting
and directing job here
, the film ' s structure isnt flawless
adn its flows together perfectly
. the dialog goes from extremely funny to morose without missing a beat
. the cast is excellent
. joseph mazzello gives the stand out performance
. jospeh is outstanding for someone of any age
, nto alone someone who jstu turned 15
. ian michael smith
, inaddition his film debut
, has such a storng physical presense that you believe he is simon without any hesitation
. other great performances are turned in by teh rest of yhe supporting cast
. i loved this movei
, it is far
and away one ofthe thte best films i have seen all yearm
. take your whole family to see simon birch
, it is a magnificent film
- an american masterpiece
.
