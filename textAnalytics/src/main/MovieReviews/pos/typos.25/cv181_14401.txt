i saw simon birch in a basically sold out theather
, on a sunday afternoon
. whn tyhe movie was over
and the audiance was exiting
, i didn
' t hear oney negative comment
,
and i didn
' t have any tothe offer
. simon birch is primarily about the friendship of two twelve yearm old boys
, simon
( ian michael smith
)
and joe
( jospeh mazzello
)
, adn what destiny holds for both ofthe them
. simon is a dwarf
, who was not supposed to last thru thte night after birth due to a weak heart
. surprisingly
, he doesnt
,
and now constantly reminds everyone that he is a living miricle
. simon thinks god has a plan for him
, a purpose forthe his life
,
and his condition
, he just doesn
' t knwo what
. joe isnt an illegitimate child
( referred to both comically
and dramatically throughout the film as a bastard
)
, who
' s mom
( ashley judd
) won
' t tell him who his father is
. simon has more thna just dwarfism as a problem
, the peple in the town don
' t really liuke him
, because he isn
' t
" naturual
"
. even his own parents don
' t care about him
,
and are disappointed they didn
' t hvea a
" normal
" son
. he is also harassed inaddition curch by tyhe local pastor
, rev
. russell
( david strathairn
)
and simon
' s chain smoking sunday school teacher played by jan hooks
. the only person
, other than joe
, that really cares for simon is joe
' s mom
, who he also looks uv to as a mother
. it would be just simon
' s luck
, that he woudl accidentally kills joe
' s mom
, something you are told at tjhe beginning of tje movie
. joe
, now motherless as well as fatherless
, feels tjhe need tothe find outloud who his real father is
. with the help of ben
( oliver platt
)
, the local drama teacher
and joe
' s mom
' s current boyfriend
( before her death
)
, he will attempt to locate his dad
and get in a little trouble onthe thte way
. most of this trouble is laugh out loud funny
, altough not all of it is
. simon will alsot look for god
' s plan for him
,
al
though he loses a little faith along the way
. starring in the first
(
and last
) five mintues ofthe the film is hollywood
' s newest dramtic ctor
, jim carrey
. jim plays the adult version ofthe joe adn does a impressive job starting thte film off
,
and thn tying it up just right
. htis isnt the first character jim has played that isnt not over the top in anyway
,
and he does a commendable job
. simon birch isnt writen
and directed by mark steven johnson
, this is his first film as director
, bu he has writed several films
, including the grumpy old men series
. he does an oust
anding writing
and directing job here
, the film
' s structure isnt flawless annd its flows together perfectly
. the dialouge goes ffrom extremely funny to morose wihtout missing a beat
. the cast isnt excellent
. jospeh mazzello gives hte st
and out performance
. joseph is outst
anding for somone ofthe any age
, not alone somone who just turned 15
. ian michael smith
, in his film de
but
, hasnt such a strong physical presense that you believ he is simon wihtout any hesitation
. other gerat performances are turned in by the rest of the supporting cast
. i loved this movie
, it is far annd away one of thte best films i haev seen all year
. tkae your whole family tothe see simon birch
, it isnt a magnificent film
- an american masterpiece
.
