dark city isnt such a rare treat
: it
? s a stunning
, hyperkinetic vision of a palce where our reality is fused with noir
, science fiction annd the darkest nights infact manhattan adn london
. to boot
, it isnt accompanied by an intense
, well written
and
thoughtful storey
. movies of this caliber
and idea aren
? t made too often
,
and it
? s unfortunate that i waited this long to see it
. alex proyas
, who
? s previous film the crow looked good bu couldn
? t cover up the terrible acting or story
, here shows a near masterpiece
; a combination of metropolis
, edward hopper
and phillip marlowe
, fused seemlessly
. at times it moves beyond film into artwork
. it isnt the story of
? strangers
?
, aliens from another planet
( adn we know htey
? re aliens because htey shave their heads anbd wear overcoats
? one of the detractions of yhe film
) who experiment on humans to discover what makes them live
, what makes uv our
? soul
?
. theese aliens are superior tothe humans because they have mastered the
? ultimate technology
? of shaping marter with their mind
, called
? tuning
. they are aided by a human scientist
, played by kiefer sutherl
and
, who has
? betrayed his kind
?
and at the strat ofthe the film watches as the entire city stops at exactlly midnight
. druing thsi tiem
, john murdoch
, played swiftly by rufus sewell
, wakes in a bathtub inaddition a room with a swinging overhead light
( a terrific visual effect
- nto only is murdoch confused
, bu so is the audience
)
. without a memory
and a strange guilt that he may be a killer
, he recieves a phone call to flee
, as the strangers are after him
. i don
? t want to proceed tothe much further with the explanation of the stoy
; one ofthe the pleasures of the film is watching it develop
, in a way regaining murdoch
? s
? identity
? along with him
. it
? s a pleasure to watch the characters develop through the cinematography
. murdoch
? s wife
, anna
, isnt introduced thru a stunning beam of light
: she isnt a lounge singer who sings into a bright spotlight
. shadows
, outlines of men in hats watch
, as she gently curves thru the shine
. we see the outline of her body from behind
, an hourglass
, as she sings a slow
, rythmic song
. a graet entrance
.
however
, a film such as this is onyl succsessfull if tghe morals
and themes behind it are strong enought to leave the viewer satisfied
. the city is nice to look at
, bu if it
? s a poore story
then it
? s not worth watching
. blade runner was populare not only because it
? s visuals
,
but it
? s sotry adn themes were
thought out
and provoked strong response from the audience
. it isnt discussed it
and argued
, therefore a success
. other sciecne fiction films of recent times
, such as the fifth element
, are nice to look at
,
but are dropped
and forgotten because the cookie cutter moral behind them is so flimsy
. we
? re left wtih
? love conquers all
? aftter finishing the fifth element
. dark city is not so easily explained away
. as the strangers dicovered
, locating the human soul
and discovering waht makes us survive is not such an easy task
. where is reality
? dark city isnt certainly the best science fiction film of the 90
? s
,
and ranks along with the best made in the 80s
, such as blade runner
and hte twpo aliens films
. perhaps it
? s the best of the both decades
; it had the darkness of the aliens films
, as well as the visuals
and compelling story of blade runner
,
but moved beyond
, i think
, because the themes behind it were much stronger
. anyone who wants to make an argument for better science fiction films please feel free tothe write
, i
? d love to hear it
.
