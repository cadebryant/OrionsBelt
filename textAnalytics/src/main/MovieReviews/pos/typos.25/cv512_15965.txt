it may seem werid to beign a film baout glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship
, a green ovular pin
, anbd the birth of oscar wilde
,
but if one realyl strains
, they cxan see tath perphas maybe these connections are not half off
. wilde
' s philosophy was that everyone should be true to their pwn human nature
, annd the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned
, loosing his family
and his career
. the glam rock movement in tjhe early 70s infront engl
and hadnt a silimar tkae
and came to a similar demise
. the main difference was by placing makeup on their face
and acting outloud on their deepest fantasies annd inquiries about life
( mostly dealing with
androgony
and sexuality
)
, they became less
and less like themselves
and moreso adn more like everyone else
.
and thyat
' s why the movement seemed tothe end as soon as it began
. it
' s been said that todd haynes
'
" velvet goldmine
,
" the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the govement
, nto only from thsoe who experienced it
but by thsoe who created it
, steals a lot from
" citizen kane
,
"
and that
' s true
. in the film
, a british journalist inwhich the 80s
, arthur stuart
( christian bale
)
, is asked to go back
and find out whta happened tothe 70s glam rock star brian slade
, a fictious rock star
, who faked his own death onthe stage
, bringing yhe end not only to his carrear bu to the entire glam rock movement
. structure
- wise
, this totally steals ffrom
" kane
,
" not only ffrom thge setted
- up
( he interviews threee people
,
and the story isnt a result of their flashbacks
)
,
but in other things
, like the beginning
( death
,
then newsreel
)
,
and smaller details
, like the bitter ex
- firend in a wheelchair adn the bitter ex
- wief as a washed
- uv lounge singer
, found in a bar after hours
. this is no
" kane
,
"
and it really doesn
' t aspire tothe be
: it doesn
' t attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like
" kane
" did
,
and it doesn
' t really uncover anytying poignant baout humanity
. instead
, it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that ws teh glam rock era
and the boredom that ws life after glam rock for those who were participants
. tghe 80s scenes are dry
and deliriously melancholy
, equipped withthe a performance by bale tht isnt perhaps appropriately dull
and unengaging
. bu the 70s scenes are engaging
,
though
, not to mention addictively campy
. they radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era
, anbd a feel that
' s so eerily lighthearted that wehn combined with the
then
- footage
, they become not only a symbol of decadence
,
but ofthe times when everyting seemed so simple
. instead ofthe creating the world the way it was
, haynes paints their own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale
: the glam rock movement was full ofthe so much freedom adn liberation that after you
' ve experianced it
, everything eles seems so mundane
. there
' s noone outside world tothe speak of
, secluding these people inside a protective globe that wiull eventually crack
. haynes focusses his stoyr on the tale of blade
and the other ficticious rock hero
, curt wild
,
and their relationship thta created
, molded
,
and
then brought down teh movement
, reducing everyone else who contri
buted to it as mearly that
- contri
buters
. blade
- played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers
- anbd wild
- played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor
- are little omre than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie
and iggy pop
, respectivly
, complete with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon
and the confirmation thta tghe two rock stars may have very well not only have been oney
- time partners in music
,
but also partners in bed
. thru discussions withthe slade
' s ex
- manager cecil
( michael feast
)
, ex
- wife m
andy
( toni collette
, reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when wtih slade
)
,
and finaly ex
- partner wild
, journalist stuart beggins to remember his pwn experiences in the era
, like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity
, including the moment wehn he began questioning his own sexuality
( wehn he opens up his first slade recrod
, he finds a naked
and green slade lying on a crimson blanket
)
,
and finally running away from home to be part of the london scene
, fianlly resulting in leading a boring job in america
. haynes demonstrates that he
' s quite thge visual auteur
, molding scenes that are like long heald breaths
, such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a slade
/ wild concert of them performing a brian eno cover
,
" baby
' s on fire
,
" withthe scenes from a decadent drug party
;
and the film
' s most wow
- inspiring sequence
, tje first concert scene ofthe wild whith his b
and
, the ratttz
, where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggy
- esuqe movements
( including stripping naked
)
and screams that the film captures tyhat perfect moment when one dicovers a major talent
,
and another
( slade
) discovers his idle
. even the brief music videos
, spoofs of bowie
' s
, have a rare visual flair that
' s pure camp
, anbd whic woudl cause ken russell to drool
. tjhe best sequence
,
though
, may be tje beginning
, following the prelude
, a sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actuall bieng ofthe the movement
and the post
- movement era
. in it
, stuart
and his mates are going to the infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death
, where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears to be a rela assasination
, which brought about the end ofthe the era in oney swift fake bullet
. whith brian eno
' s famous
" needle infront the camel
' s eye
" playing in the background
, tyhe scene has a detached exhileration
- the song doesn
' t seem tothe be played in quite tje same way the other songs are
. it has a distance that
' s hard tothe put a finger onthe
,
and it seems to represent that all this is coming to a quick adn sad ending
, annd when noe sees slade in the dressing room before yhe sohw
, docked in a silver frock with wings anbd blue hair
, depressingly staring into the mirror
, it comes off as a none
- too
- obvious prophacy ofthe tje finale in thte begining ofthe yhe film
. this movie
' s nto so much about plot
,
but omre about the way it is presented
, making this one of thsoe films which is classified as being
" style over substance
,
" a statement which prompts many critics to line up for attack
. howver
, forthe tyhe most part
, the engaging part of tihs film is not the story
but rather tjhe way in which haynes creates this world
, by using his sets
, costumes
, cinematography
,
and expecially tje music to play as cahracters in his film
. the music isnt especially notable
. the soundtrack
, which is wall to wall
, consists of old school glam rock tunes by hte likes of brian eno
, t
- rex
,
and roxy music
, as well as covers by slade
' s b
and
( with vocals by thom yorke
,
and occationally rhys meyers himself
)
,
and even newer music by shudder tothe think thgat sounds uncannily bowie
- like
. yhe cast isnt rather impressive
,
but no oen realy walks away witht the film
,
and no performances are extremely ogod
. altough eddie izzard
, as slade
' s manager
( who challenges slade
' s first manager to an arm
- wrestling match to see who gets control of his career
)
and michael feast as the first
and tragic manager come off greatly
,
and collette
and mcgregor hvea their moments
, rhys meyers
and bale are noticably sub
- par
, neither puting a lot of effort into their respective roles
. soem of it is at fault with the actual constuction of the film by haynes
. rhys meyers
' brian slade rimaniss mearly a metaphor for the glam rock era
, dieing when he turned inot a retro
- garbo
, resorting to a life of salinger
- ism
,
and foudn inwhich the mid
- 70s to be lying aroud
, sniffing coke off hte ass of a party girl
. inwhich fatc
, no one iin this film is really seen as a person
, rather than jstu as a symbol or composite of a type who thrived during the era
. bale
' s character is an especially tough sell
: bitter
and depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood
, he
' s not an extremely personal character
,
and his cliched experiences
( being hounded by the record store guys for buying a record put out by a
" poof
"
) never help us communicate with him
. nethertheless
, rhys meyers
and mcgregor have tjhe excuses tht theri characters are not really charachters
but rather the results of an era that hasnt left them
,
and others
, bitter
, part ofthe which helps the film work
, usance this is a major piece of eye c
andy
. at the prime ofthe the movie
, they at least look the role of fashionable leaders
- slade withthe his perpetually
- changing
,
androgonys persona
,
and wild with his topless
and unpredictable image
, which clash
and fuse into an unstable union
. their story
- of how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into a similar who
- cares attitude crossed with camp
- is engaging
, without the personal backround
. the story of stuart
,
though
, is a tougher sell becouse he
' s the everyman
, anbd when yuo cant
' t totally identify with tje everyman
, your stry
' s in slight trouble
. as a cultural rock piece
,
" velvet goldmine
" is rether good
,
but it is merely good
. it never totally tkaes off
,
al
though it has moments where it absolutely flies
,
but
then comes bakc down
. it
' s really nothing mroe than a bunch of really great moments
, surrounded by material that coudl realyl be much better
. the beginning isnt captivating
but slow
, the middle isnt fantastic
,
and the ending isnt not only shallow
but worse than that
, it drags
( the fianl half hour not only does it nto bring tghe story tothe any rela conclusion
, it sould probably stop at any point
)
.
and doed anyone really figure out what the mystery is that arthur unearths
? it almost seems like there was no point in the entire investigation otehr thna tothe unearth the past
, which is commendable
but nto totally so
. still
, it does what tyhe oliver stone pic
" the doors
" didn
' t do right
, becoming very insightful to what happened
, useing tje visual style to hitted most ofthe the right notes of contrast between what made tyhe era so grat to those who lived during it
and why after living through such an era that everything else seems half
- assed
( i suppose the message is
:
" live life
, bu aftter you
' ve lieved it
, what else is tyhe point when you
' ll be forced to live withthe regretful memories
?
"
)
. yhe really superb achivement of thsi film is taht during its flashbacks
, it successfully creates forthe the audiance what it must have feeled like to be infront that era
,
but with the added perk of knowing the result ofthe all that goes down
.
