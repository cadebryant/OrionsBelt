it may seem werid to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship
, a gren ovular pin
,
and teh birth of oscar wilde
,
but if one realyl strains
, tehy can see that perhaps maybe theese connections are not half off
. wilde ' s philosophy was that everyone should be true tothe their own human nature
,
and the result ofthe his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned
, loosing his family
and his career
. the glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had a similar take
and cameback to a similair demise
. the main diference was by placing makeup on theri face
anbd acting out on their deepest fantasies
annd inquiries about life
( mostly dealing with androgony
and sexuality
)
, they became less
and less like themselves
and more
and more like everyone else
.
and tath ' s why tyhe movement seemed to end as soon as it began
. it ' s been said that todd haynes '
" velvet goldmine
,
" the film thta chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement
, not only from those who experianced it
but by those who created it
, steals a lot ffrom
" citizen kane
,
"
and that ' s true
. in the film
, a british journalist in thte 80s
, arthur stuart
( christian bale
)
, is asked to go back
and find outloud what happened to 70s glam rock star brian slade
, a fictitious rock star
, who faked his own death on stage
, bringing the end not only to his career
but tothe tghe entire glam rock movment
. structure
- wise
, this totally steals ffrom
" kane
,
" not only from the set
- up
( he interviews three people
,
and the story is a result of thier flashbacks
)
,
but in other things
, like the beginning
( death
,
then newsreel
)
,
and smaller details
, like tyhe bitter ex
- friend in a wheelchair
and hte bitter ex
- wife as a washed
- up lounge singer
, found inwhich a bar after hours
. this is no
" kane
,
"
and it really doesn ' t aspire to be
: it doesn ' t attempt to be the deepo outlook of something gone like
" kane
" did
,
and it doesn ' t really uncover anything poignant about humanity
. instead
, it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era
anbd hte boredom thta was life after glam rock for those who were participants
. the 80s scenes are dry
and deliriously melancholy
, equipped with a peformance by bale that is perhaps appropriately dull
and unengaging
.
but yhe 70s scenes are engaging
,
though
, not to mention addictively campy
. tehy radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors ofthe hte era
,
and a feel that ' s so eerily lighthearted thyat whn combined with hte
then
- footage
, they become not only a symbol of decadence
,
bu ofthe times when everything seemed so simple
. instead of creating yhe world the way it was
, haynes paints their own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale
: the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom
and liberation that after you ' ve experienced it
, everything eles seems so mundane
. htere ' s no outside world to speak ofthe
, secluding these people inside a protective globe that will eventually crack
. haynes focuses his story on tjhe tale of blade
and the other ficticious rock hero
, curt wild
,
and thier relationship tath created
, molded
,
annd
then brang down yhe govement
, reducing everyone esle who contributed to it as mearly that
- contributors
. blade
- played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers
-
and wild
- played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor
- are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie
adn iggy pop
, respectivly
, complete with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon
and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well nto only have been oney
- time partners in music
,
but also partners in bed
. through discussions iwth slade ' s ex
- manager cecil
( michael feast
)
, ex
- wief mandy
( toni collette
, reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when with slade
)
,
and finally ex
- partner wild
, journalist stuart begins to rember his own experiences infact tje era
, liek his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity
, including yhe moment wehn he began questioning his own sexuality
( when he opens up his first slade recrod
, he finds a naked
and green slade lying on a crimson blanket
)
,
and fianlly runing awya from home to be part of the london scene
, finally resulting inwhich leading a boring job in america
. haynes demonstrates that he ' s qutie the visual auteur
, molding scenes that are like long heald breaths
, such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a slade
/ wild concert ofthe them performing a brian eno cover
,
" baby ' s onthe fire
,
" with scenes from a decadent drug party
;
and tghe film ' s most wow
- inspiring sequence
, the firt concert scene of wild witht his band
, the ratttz
, where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam taht his wild iggy
- esuqe movements
( including stripping naked
)
and screams thgat the film captures thta perfect moment when one discovers a major talent
,
and anyother
( slade
) discovers his idle
. even thte brief music videos
, spoofs ofthe bowie ' s
, have a rare visual flair thta ' s pure camp
,
and whihc would cause ken russell to drool
. thte best sequence
,
though
, may be the beginning
, following the prelude
, a sequence hwihc acts as tyhe middle ground for both hte actual bieng of hte govement
and the post
- govement era
. in it
, stuart
adn his mates are going to the infamous slade concert where he fakes his pwn death
, where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in waht appears to be a real assasination
, which brang baout the end of the era in one swift fake bullet
. with brian eno ' s famoust
" needle in the camel ' s eye
" playing inthe teh background
, the scene has a detached exhileration
- the song doesn ' t seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are
. it has a distance that ' s hard to put a finger on
,
annd it seems to represent that all this is coming to a quick
and sad ending
,
and when one sees slade in the dressing room before the show
, docked infact a silver frock with wings
adn blue hair
, depressingly staring into the mirror
, it comes off as a none
- too
- obvious prophecy ofthe the finale infact thge beginning ofthe the film
. this movie ' s not so much about plot
,
but omre about the way it is presented
, mkaing this noe of thsoe films whihc is classified as being
" style over substance
,
" a statement which prompts many critics to line up for attack
.
however
, for the most part
, the engaging part ofthe this film isnt not yhe story
but rather the way in whlch haynes creates this world
, by using his sets
, costumes
, cinematography
,
and especialy the music tothe play as characters in his film
. the music is especialy notable
. the soundtrack
, which isnt wall to wall
, consists of old school glam rock tunes by the likes ofthe brian eno
, t
- rex
,
and roxy music
, as well as covers by slade ' s band
( with vocals by thom yorke
,
and occasinally rhys meyers himself
)
,
and even newer music by shudder to think that sounds uncannily bowie
- like
. tjhe cast is rether impressive
,
but noone one really walks awya with the film
,
and noone performances are extemely good
.
although eddie izzard
, as slade ' s manager
( who challenges slade ' s first manager to an arm
- wrestling match to see who gets control of his career
)
anbd michael feast as the first
and tragic manager come off greatly
,
annd collette
and mcgregor have their moments
, rhys meyers
and bale are noticably sub
- par
, niether putting a lot of effort inot their respective roles
. some ofthe it is at fault with the actual construction of the film by haynes
. rhys meyers ' brian slade remains mearly a metaphor for the glam rock era
, dieing when he turned inot a retro
- garbo
, resorting tothe a life of salinger
- ism
,
and found in the mid
- 70s to be lying arround
, sniffing coke off the ass of a party girl
. inthe fact
, no noe in this film is really seen as a person
, rather than just as a symbol or composite of a type who thrived durig the era
. bale ' s character is an especially tough sell
: bitter
and depressed by flashbacks tothe his young adulthood
, he ' s not an extremely personal character
,
and his cliched experiences
( being hounded by the record tsore guys fo buying a record put out by a
" poof
"
) never help us communicate with him
. nevertheless
, rhys meyers
and mcgregor have yhe excuses tyhat thier characters are not realyl characters
bu rather the results of an era that has left them
,
and others
, bitter
, part of whic helps the film owrk
, since this is a major piece of eye candy
. at the prime of the movie
, they at least look the role of fashionable leaders
- slade with his perpetually
- changeing
, androgonys persona
,
and wild wtih his topless
and unpredictable image
, which clash
and fuse inot an unstable union
. their story
- ofthe how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into a similar who
- cares atitude crossed wtih camp
- is engaging
, wihtout the personal backgorund
. teh story of stuart
,
though
, is a tougher sell because he ' s the everyman
,
and when you cant ' t totally identify with the everyman
, your story ' s in slight trouble
. as a cultural rock piece
,
" velvet goldmine
" is rather good
,
but it isnt merely ogod
. it never totally tkaes off
,
although it hasnt moments where it absolutely flies
,
but
then comes bcak down
. it ' s really nothing more thna a bunch of relaly great moments
, surrounded by material that could really be much better
. the beginnig is captivating
but slow
, the middle isnt fantastic
,
and the ending is not only shallow
but worse than that
, it drags
( the final half hour nto only does it not bring the stoyr to any real conclusion
, it could probably stop at any point
)
.
and did anyone really figure out what the mystery is that arthur unearths
? it almost seems like there was no point in the entire investigation other tahn to unearth the past
, whlch is commendable
but nto totally so
. still
, it does what the oliver stone pic
" the doors
" didn ' t do right
, becoming very insightful to whta hapened
, using the visual style tothe hit most ofthe tghe right notes ofthe contrast between what made the era so grat to those who lived during it
and why affter living through such an era that everthing eles seems half
- assed
( i suppose tghe message isnt
:
" live life
,
but after you ' ve lieved it
, what alse is the point whn you ' ll be forced tothe live with regretful memories
?
"
)
. tje really superb achievement of this film is thta during its flashbacks
, it successfully creates for thte audience what it must have felt like tothe be inthe that era
,
bu with the added perk of knowing the result of all taht goes down
.
