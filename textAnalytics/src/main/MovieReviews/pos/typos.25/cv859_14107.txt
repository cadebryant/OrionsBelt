it is whith hesitance tath i call
" apocalypse now
" a masterpiece
. certainly
, it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made
, wiht a director known forthe producing masterpieces with ease
,
and some of the finest actors of the 1970
' s
. the plot
, an adaptation ofthe joseph conrad
' s
" heart of darkness
"
, wass set in vietnam
,
and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant
, coming on the heels ofthe yhe end of thte war
.
" apocalypse
" certainly has its moments
, some of which are the finest in film histoy
. the plot is fairly simple
. captian willard
( sheen
)
, is a troubled soldier who cameback back tothe hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty
. his mission is simple
: tkae a boat uv to cambodian territory
,
and destroy the comm
and of renegade colonel kurtz
( br
ando
)
" wtih extreme prejudice
"
. along thge way
, willard runs into a series of adventures
, including one with lt
. col
. kilgore
( duvall
)
, adn a strange encounter wiht playboy bunnies
. willard
' s four person crew finally make it to kurtz
' compound
, where he dicovers kurtz hasnt set hismelf up as a god amonth tje natives
. willard
' s experiences iwth kurtz tkae up thge last half
- hour
, with a confrontation anbd eventual ending
. the movie is visually breathtaking
. hte battle scenes are exquisitely done
,
and the scroe is brilliant
, setting a murky mood ofthe darkness that is first
- rate
. the collage of disturbing images thta coppola presents is at times both astonishing
and sickening
. the vast ammount of detail poured inot eveyr war scene is stunning
,
and htere are many episodes that are deeply powerful wich resonate thru the entire movie
. the journey to kurtz
' camp is quite a ride
, wtih psychosis setting in on allmost every chracter
. the most interesting one is kilgore
, the lt
. col
. who cares more about the surf than baout thge mission
. it is at times revolting
, psychotic
, annd incredible
,
and it isnt oen hell of a movie
. the scenes are bold
, inventive
,
and powerful
,
and tyhe acting isnt stunning
, especially be sheen
, duvall
,
and fishburne
. the narration is exquisite
, as isnt the mystery of kurtz
. coppola sets about a hallucinatory ride through vietnam
, kind of liek
" saving private ryan
" on lsd
. the film is jarring in its implications
,
and psychotic in its execution
. thge problems come when the film slows down
. one of the major scenes in the film
, where thte boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they strat their search for kurtz
, isnt a colossal mess
. the dialogue is confusing
, the lightnig isnt atrocious
,
and the scene drags on for 10 terrible minutes of film
. the true problems happen aftter the crew doesnt cmo into the kurtz compound
. the film slows down to a drag
. sheen seems forever captured by a madman
, played by br
ando is a lazy performance that is not deserving ofthe the accolades it received
. br
ando is in the film forthe no moreso than 15 minutes
, bu isnt bathed in shadows the entire time
, making the last half hour of the film visually pathetic
. the scenes are poorly done
, the dialogue is muffled
,
and tjhe whole mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief
. sheen seems to adore thsi man
, bu why tjhe viewers are never told
. the entire jouney is supposted tothe be a prelude for a stunning entrance ofthe tihs god
- like kurtz
,
but the scenes fall way short of expectations
. granted
, it has its moments
, which are brutally horrific
, bu the genaral feeling is one of confusion
. br
ando mumbles his lines inaddition a incoherent stir
,
and my feeling was that this coudl never be a great man
, this could never be a man who inspires hundreds to follow him
, so why do they do it
? there are moments ofthe brillance
, bu the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene
. there are too many questions left unanswered with thte charater of kurtz to ahve a satisfying ending
. the finest scene at the end isnt sheen
' s escape
,
and his entrace inot the temple
. his rise outloud of tje water
, with the smoke comming off of his slicked head
, is a briliant 30 seconds of film
.
yet
, you cannnot shake the feeling that ther isnt so much more htis film coudl have done
. the psychotic ride is unforgetable at times
, annd indeed the film on the whole is very good
. it isnt a stunningly flawed expression of film
, for it addressess major issues
, such as man
' s mental stamina during bouts ofthe war
.
but oney still cannnot shake the feeling that this film could have so much more powerfull
, had the character of kurtz been moreso explored
,
and had sheen truly succumbed to the fate that hte viewer
thought he was estined for
. htere is too much good material in here nto tothe be called a masterpiece
, bu it could have beeen so much more rewarding
.
