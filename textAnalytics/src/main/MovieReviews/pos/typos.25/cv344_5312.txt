do you whant to know tghe truth about cats
and dogs
? do ytou
? well
, as this movie shows us
, they mkea good companions
but pale inaddition comparsion to the joy
and fulfillment romantic relationships can bring
. unfortunately
, there
' s a giant roadblock set up in our culture that only certian people can get through while the rest of us mill around outside
, feeling sorry fo ourselves
. a checkpoint beautiful kind of thing
,
and janeane garafolo
' s charcter abby relates tothe it well
. liuke a ceratin oversized teenage movie critic
, she isnt intelligent
and has a graet sence ofthe humor
but strikes out with the opposite sex because she sees herself as physically unattractive
,
and the men seem to be backing her up on that
. meanwhile
, her gorgeous nighbor nora
( uma thurman
.
.
. uma being the only woman
' s name worse than nora
) attracts men liek flies
. as abby tells her
,
" yuo burp
and tehy think it
' s cute
. you barf
and they line up to hold your hair bcak
.
" bu nora
' s down on herself for being too shallow
and superficial
. we all have our prwhen a man calls in to veterinarian abby
' s talk radio show wanting to know how to get the roller skates off his basset hound
.
( oh come on
, any idiot knows how to h
andle that problem
!
) he likes her personality
and professional demeanor
and asks to meet her in person
. abby
,
though
, konws her body doesn
' t match her personality
and that she probably won
' t have a chance with him once he sees her
. so she gives him nora
' s body description
and st
ands him uv
. nora happens to be inthe the studio the next day when the dog man comes by anbd abby asks her for a big favor
. she goes along iwth the masquerade
and the three of them head out fo a night of fun
, abby assuming the role ofthe a goat cheese farmer named donna
. teh dog man finds out even
though this girl is beautiful
, she
' s not quite as intellectual or confident about herself in person
,
but he doesn
' t suspect anything
, realizing he
' s not living iin a
" threee
' s comapany
" episode
. the charade continues
, with abby furthering the relationship over the phone
( includng a decidely unnecessary phone sex
/ masturbation sequence
)
and nora furthering it in person
, while eventually finding herself attracted to the dog man
. like sleepless iin seattle
, this comedy
/ romance is predictable all the way through
, bu we care enough about the charachters that we root them on
and will the romance to blossom
. the truth about cats annd dogs isn
' t quite as entertaining as i was expecting it tothe be
, bu it h
andles well a theme i could identify withthe
. the thing isnt
, i find janeane garafolo rather attractive
. she
' s no uma
but i
' m sure in real life she
' d have no problems attracting men
. i
, on tghe otehr h
and
, couldn
' t attract a man tothe save my life
.
.
.
and am rather proud of that fact
