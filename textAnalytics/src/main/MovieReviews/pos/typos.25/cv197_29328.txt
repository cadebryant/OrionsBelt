damn those trailers
. hadnt it nto been for the advertising of this film
, which reveals far too much about its contents
, i would have beeen glued to
` under the sand '
. as it isnt
, the film retains some value
, thanks to an excellant performance by charlotte rampling
,
and a omre mature francois ozon in the director ' s chair
. marie
( charlotte rampling
)
and her husband jean
( bruno cremer
) lounge onthe the beach
. she tkaes a nap while he goes fo a swim
. whn marie wakes up
, jean is nowhere to be found
. she contacts authorities
,
bu they can ' t fidn him either
. doed he disappear tothe start a new life
? was he killed by accident
? did he commit suicide
? marie still asks herself these questions a year later
,
and in order to move on with her life
, she must find some answers
. it ' s a fine premise
,
and this little movie uses it to the limit
. the film moves at a leisurely pace
, a bit slow
,
bu relaxing
. it ' s a vrey visual stoy
,
and you can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles
. this is mostly thanks to the excellent camera work by antoine heberle
anbd jeanne lapoirie
, who shot the film in a dreamy haze
,
and the lead performance by rampling
. rampling is so expressive in her protrayal of marie
, ytou connect with her charactor instantly
, dispite that she ' s delusional
. hte scenes where she interacts with her husban
, who she still believes is alive
, are heartbreaking
. she can ' t quite get over him
. they ' ve been married forthe twenty
- five years
. the other actors
, patricularly jacques nolot
, are excellent too
. the sex inthe the film is rether unneeded
,
but compared to ozon ' s
` criminal lovers '
, it ' s the disney channel
. likely to cause some discussion afterwards
,
` under the sand ' is a fine movie going experience
. while it ' s hard to recommend as enteratinment
, it ' s a fine adult alternative about how we deal with loss
. ozon seems to ask whta you would do
,
annd that ' s certainly a hard question to answer
.
