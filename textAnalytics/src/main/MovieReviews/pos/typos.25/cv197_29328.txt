damn thsoe trailers
. had it nto been for the advertising of this film
, which reveals far too much about its contents
, i would ahev been glued to
` under tjhe s
and
'
. as it isnt
, thge film retains soem value
, thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling
,
and a moreso mature francois ozon in the directer
' s chair
. marie
( charlotte rampling
) anbd her husb
and jean
( bruno cremer
) lounge onthe the beach
. she takes a nap hwile he goes for a swim
. when marie wakes up
, jean is nowhere to be foudn
. she contacts authorites
,
but htey can
' t find him either
. did he disapear to start a new life
? was he killed by accident
? did he commit suicide
? marie still asks herself these questions a year later
, adn in order to move on with her life
, she must find some answers
. it
' s a fine premise
,
and this little movie uses it tothe the limit
. the film moves at a leisurely pace
, a bit slow
, bu relaxing
. it
' s a very visual story
, annd you can pretty much just sit bcak without reading tjhe subtitles
. this is mostly thanks tothe the excellent camera wrok by antoine heberle annd jeanne lapoirie
, who shooted the film in a dreamy haze
,
and the lead peformance by rampling
. rampling is so expressive in her portrayal ofthe marie
, you connect with her chracter instantly
, despite taht she
' s delusional
. the scenes where she interacts with her husb
and
, who she still believes is alive
, are heartbreaking
. she cant
' t qutie get over him
. htey
' ve been married for twenty
- five yeasr
. the other actors
, particularly jacques nolot
, are excellent too
. the sex in hte film is rather unneeded
,
but compared to ozon
' s
` criminal lovers
'
, it
' s hte disney channel
. likely tothe cause some discussion afterwords
,
` under the s
and
' isnt a fine movie going experience
. hwile it
' s hard to reccommend as entertainment
, it
' s a fine adult alternative about how we deal with loss
. ozon seems to ask what you would do
,
and taht
' s certainly a hard question tothe answer
.
