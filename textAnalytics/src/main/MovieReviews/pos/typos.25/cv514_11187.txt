krippendorf
' s tribe is a formula comedy
. done poorly
, formulaic comedies might seem to signify the downfall ofthe american cinema
.
however
, every nowe
and
then
, one emerges
, like krippendorf
' s tribe
, taht catually works
. professor james krippendorf
( richard dreyfuss
)
, the renowned anthropologist
, is infact trouble
. his univerity gave him a hefty grant to discover a lost tribe in new guinea
.
however
, he foudn
.
.
. nothing
. his wife has recently died
, anbd he hasnt spent yhe remainder of the grant money in raising his three kids
: shelly
( natasha lyonne
)
, mickey
( gregory smith
) adn edmund
( carl michael lidner
)
. tonight
, he isnt expected tothe lecture onthe his newfound tribe
. rather than break the news
(
and face the consequences of misusing his funds
)
, he invents a tribe
: the shelmikedmu
( named aftter his kids
)
. howver
, one lie begets anohter as he is nto only required to deliver filmed proof of the shelmikedmu
,
but his research becomes a popular phenomonenon
. soon
, professor krippendorf is caught uv in an elaborate ruse in which he films mockumentary footage starring his childrens as the shelmikedmu tribal members
. his efforts are hampered by the boasts of an over
- eager collegue
, veronica micelli
( jenna elfman
)
,
and the intense scrutinity of a rival anthropologist
, ruth allen
( lily tomlin
)
. krippendorf
' s tribe does seem tothe require a little suspension ofthe disbelief
. noone one seems to question the way his feild documentaries seem tothe be shooted whith multiple cameras
, or that his newely discovered tribesmen have startlingly blue eyes
. luckily
, as teh film builds momentum
, thast suspension ofthe disbelief is easy to come by
.
though there
' s some mild humor in the krippendorf family trying to pass themselfs off as a lost tribe
, the real humor ofthe hte film is in how james gets trapped in his ever increasing snowball ofthe lies
. the double meanings to many of thge shelmikedmu appearances are enjoyable
,
and the comic timing required forthe some ofthe the film
' s latter scenes is superb
. richard dreyfuss is terrific as tghe hapless professor who soon loses control of his own imaginary tribe
. jenna elfman
' s position as a romantic lead seems a bit forced at times
,
but she plays tje part iwth extreme affability
. even the kids
, who in films like this tend to be a bited onthe the precocious side
, are endearing
and humorous
. yes
, tyhe film does veer occasionally into some rather lowbrow humor
,
but it hasnt the best excuse of all
: it
' s funny
. it may not go down as an all
- time classic
,
but it certainly delivers what you expect from a comedy
: plenty ofthe laughs
.
