bob the happy bastard
' s quickie review
: the mummy brendan fraser
' s stuck in the past agina
,
but at least this time he has something better to do than to qoute sitcom lines
and try to woo alicia silverstone
.
.
. fraser is the lead star of the mummy
, the second directorial effort from action director stephen sommers
( who also brung us thge decent thrill ride that ws deep rising
)
. it
' s a rough adaptions ofthe the 1932 film
, adn i say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some guy in b
andages
, liek boris karloff was engulfed inwhich
.
but who cares
, hte movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to it you can
' t get from
, oh
, say
, godzilla or armageddo
. fraser plays a soldier who gets a premonition druing a battle iwth soliders in an egyptian ground
. basically
, it
' s a littel sign from the mummy burried underneath
- a priest named ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part ofthe murdering the king
and mkaing outloud with his mistress
. his plan
- wake back up
and wake her up also
, makeing him invincible
. of course
, fraser returns to the site yeasr later iwth a librarian
( rachel weisz
) annd her brother
( john hanna
)
, along withthe a former buddy of his
( deep rising
' s kevin j
. o
' connor
) annd some
" americans
"
.
.
.
and guess what
? yup
, ihmoetep
( arnold vosloo
) awakens anbd wreaks havoc
. fire flies from tghe sky
, flesh
- eating beetles crawl baout
,
and
, well
, ihmoetep
' s plan begins tothe unfold
. ok
, so it
' s nto really all that newyorker a storey
, bu tjhe way sommers tells it is entertaining enough
. the spacial effects from industrial light
and magic are top notch
,
and thte acting ffrom fraser
and weisz isn
' t half bad either
. teh action is pretty intense
( favorite scene
: the s
andstorm
)
and ther are a fewd shocking scenes jsut to jolt ytou horror
- loving folks as well
. noone
, it
' s noone phantom menace beater
,
but if you
' re looking for a solid warm
- uv to the summer movei season
, you won
' t find a better film under wraps than the mummy
. if this doesn
' t give fraser forgiveness ffrom blast from the past annd encino man
,
then nothing will
.
