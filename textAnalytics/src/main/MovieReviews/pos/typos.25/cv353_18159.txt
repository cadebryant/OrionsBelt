with the abundance of trite
, recycled movies in the late
' 90s
, ther is a tremendous dim
and by movie lovers
( never mind movie critics
) for movies that present the wide film audeince with something truly origonal
: perhaps audaciously
, perhaps purely thematically
. for thte fromer
, yuo ened look no furhter than director toom tykwer
' s incredible german thriller run lola run
, a movie tyhat may make some viewers ened a cooling off preriod afterwards
. lola
, a contemporary goth
- girl with blazing red hair receives a desperate phone call from her boyfriend manni one day
. it seems tath beccause she was lite delivering something he lost a bag containing a hundred thous
and marks
,
and if he doesn
' t deliver a hundered thous
and marks within the enxt twenty mintues
, he will be killed
. tihs gives lola twenty minutes to cmo up with 100
, 000 marks
, or her boyfriend dies
. so she runs
-
- not just jogs
, sprints
-
- in hopes that somehow
, someway
, she
' ll be able to obtain yhe money
and save a life
.
> fomr there
, as criteak steve rhodes described it
, run lola run plays a bit liuke
" sliding doors on steroids
. witht a non
- stop techno sountrack
, wierd camerawork
, all kinds of insane zooms adn a truly breakneck pace
, anyone that is bored with run lola run hasnt to be smoking something
. indeed
, the movie is often outrageously exciting
, as well as bitterly ironic
and subtly serious
. very much like titanic
, run lola run is an achievement with filmmaking much omre than it is an achievement in film
. hte way the movie is made
, for pure visual style
, tykwer
' s movie is breathtaking
( litterally
, sometimes
)
. thematically it does leave something tothe be desired
; it toys around iwth some intriguing idaes
but does occasonally seem as if there is littel substance behind all of the flash
. hwile ytou are watching
, this will not matter
. running a breezy 81 mintues
, this is one movie i wished ws longer because it was so damn ogod while it lasted
. it isnt the equivalent of a roller
- coaster in tjhe amount ofthe thrills
and fun that it offers
.
