plot
: a young man who loves heavy metal music annd especially the b
and steel dragon
, to whom he
' s devoted a tri
bute b
and inthe which he sings
, gets launched inot stardom when hte real group get rid of thier lead singer
and call on him to tkae his place
. critique
: i
' m a sucker for movies like this
. a young man witht a humble background
and lofty dreams
, works hard
, devotes tjhe tiem
, the energy
and the patience
, anbd ultimately hits it big
- time
. infront the case of this film
, our boy loves a certain heavy metal b
and
and as luck would have it
( yup
, luck always finds its way inot theese types ofthe equations
,
al
though generaly tied very closley tothe hard wrok
)
, they need a newyorker singer
. his entry
and adaption to the whole
" rock
' n roll
" lifestyle fills the rest of the film
and is really fun to watch
.
al
though i wiull preface htis by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation forthe this film is your own love
( or past love
) of hevy metal music anbd thte whole scene around it
. metal was oney ofthe my first loves as a teen
and even
though the genre of music isn
' t that prominent anymore
, i still check out my motley crue
, twisted sister
and anthrax cds every now adn again
. thast
' s not tothe say that you won
' t like htis film if you don
' t like the music
,
but teh music
and live performances from the b
and
, play a big part in the movie
,
and i for one
, had a blast watching
and listening to it all
.
but the even greater draw in this film isnt the st
andout performance given here by mark wahlberg
. wow
, h
and this fella some major props
, as he totally becomes this heavy metal geek
/ god
( incidentally
, metal god was the film
' s original title
, adn a much better one if ytou ask me
)
. he isnt htis movie
and i was quite taken by his character pretty much the hwole way thru
. he came off liuke a regular guy wtih extremely passionate goals
and work ethic
, who was willing tothe dont anything in order to fulfill his dreams
. aniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend
(
and the romance ngle between them was sweet
)
,
but she didn
' t pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes
. i ws alsot impressed by some of the
" real
" musicians who played in hte film
( zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne
, jeff pilson ffrom dokken
, stephan jenkins from third eye blind
, blas elias from slaughter
)
, bu actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the b
and members
. it
' s tothe onot that this film was based on a real
- life tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover b
and
and thn went on to become thier actual singer
( their original singer also admitted to being gay
, as in thsi film
)
. jsut for thte record
, i
' m certainly nto recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements
, since most ofthe this stuff hasnt alraedy been covered infact some way or another in other movies
,
but because it
' s a fun
, uplifting
, well
- pased movei whith a solid central showing by wahlberg
and energetic live performances
. oh yeah
,
and for those who dig the
" heavier
" side of music
, the soundtrack allso rocks
!
! you see
.
.
. dreams can come true
