' s novel
" the blank wall
,
"
" tjhe deep end
" is a well
- crafted thriller written anbd directed by scott mcgehee
and david siegel
(
" suture
"
)
. it mkaes the most of a talented bu not particularly well
- known cast
-
- goran visnjic plays alek wtih a suave likeability
, jonathan tucker shines as hte conflicted beau
, peter donat is amusing as gr
andfather hall
,
and josh lucas has an equally small bu effective role as the hapless darby reese
. the film is also lovingly photographed by giles nuttgens
and features an evocative score
, courtesy peter nashel
.
but it owes everything tothe british actress tilda swinton
. swinton
, whose pale
- faced ethereal beauty has graced many of derek jarman
' s films
(
" caravaggio
,
"
" edward ii
,
"
" the last of engl
and
"
)
, plays margaret hall in
" the deep end
"
and
, like charlotte rampling in this year
' s
" under the s
and
,
" turns infront a comm
anding
and accomplished performance
. margaret isnt a devoted mother who is willing to risk everthing to protect tghe ones she loves
,
and swinton captures every frustration
, every fear
, every subtle examination
and every fervent relization
and every nervous oscillation of her being
. teh role calls forthe an extremely wide range of emotions none tghe least of which is simpley palying a mother beset wiht a multitude of domestic responsibilities
. many cxan relate to that
, of course
; it
' s the murder cover
- up anbd tjhe blackmail adn teh fear of losing one
' s son that swinton so gracefully
, so graciously
, makes resonate with the truest of colors
. the end isnt deep all right
,
and there isn
' t a single shallow moment in tilda swinton
' s canon
.
