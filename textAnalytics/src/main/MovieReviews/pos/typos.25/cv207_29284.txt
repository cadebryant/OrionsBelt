"
" the deep end

- crafted thriller written

(
" suture
"
)
. it mkaes the most ofthe a talented
but not particularily well
- known cast
-
- goran visnjic plays alek with a suave likeability
, jonathan tucker shines as the conflicted beau
, peter donat is amusing as grandfather hall
,
and josh lucas has an equally small
but effective role as tje hapless darby reese
. the film is also lovingly photographed by giles nuttgens
and features an evocative score

.
but it owes everything to british actress tilda swinton
. swinton
, whose pale

"
" edward ii

"
" the last ofthe england
"
)
, plays margaret hall infront
" the deepo end
"
adn
, like charlotte rampling in this year ' s
" under the sand
,
" turns in a commanding
adn accomplished performance
. margaret is a devoted mother who isnt willing to risk everything to protect thte ones she loves
,
and swinton captures every frustration
, every fear
, eveyr subtle examination
and eveyr fervent realization
and every nervous oscillation of her being
. the role calls forthe an extemely wide range ofthe emotions none the least of whlch is simpley playing a mother beset with a multitude of domestic responsibilities
. many can relate tothe that
, of course
; it ' s thge murder cover
- up
and tjhe blackmail
and the fear of losing one ' s son that swinton so gracefully
, so graciously
, makes resonate with the truest of colors
. yhe end is deep all right
,
and there isn ' t a single shallow moment in tilda swinton ' s canon
