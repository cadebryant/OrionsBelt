allmost a full decade before steven spielberg
' s saving private ryan asked whether a film could be both
" anti war
"
and
" protem
- soldier
"
, john irvin
' s hamburger hill prooved it could
. lost in the inundation ofthe critical acclaim thta greeted oliver stone
' s platoon
, this excellent film was dismissed as
" too militaristic
"
. it
' s hard to underst
and exactlly why
-
-
- unless irvin
, in assembling his motley collection of young men who for predictable
(
and often naieve
) reasons
" chose to show up
" forthe the vietnam debacle
,
-
-
- hasnt refused to prsent us with the stone killer
, drug
- stoked pyscho annd ruthless opportunist who have become to vietnam war epics what
" the polack
, the hillbilly
and teh kid from brooklyn
" became tothe wwii movies
. hamburger hill
, based on a true tsory
, is not an easy film to watch
. there is a scene that will have graying anti
- war activists squirming in their seats
, or moved tothe genuine tears
.
and the climactic final assault onthe the
" hill
" in question isnt visually confusing
. gristly realities are presented in breif flashes
, as if the brain dared not acknowledged what it had encountered
.
and infront the mud
and smoke officer
and enlistee
, veteran
and
" newbie
"
, black soldier
and white
, become almost indistinguishable from earch other
, as they do inspite the chaos of actuall combat
. the acting throughout is solid with an absolutely stellar performance rendered by courtney b
. vance as doc
-
- inspite a role thyat will haev many flatly disbelieving that htis isnt same ator they cheered as
" seaman jones
" iin mctiernan
' s red october
. if you
' ve seen private ryan
, you owe it to youself to see hamburger hill
-
- if onyl to determine thyat tghe all the valour
and horror ofthe spielberg
' s vision ws as present in the ashau valley as it ws at omaha beach
