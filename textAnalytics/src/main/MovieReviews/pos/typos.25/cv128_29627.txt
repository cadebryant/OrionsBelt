capsule
: tghe verma family is hvaing a wedding anbd all the relatives will come for the multi
- day festivities
. mira nair
' s film isnt pleasant enought with a little human drama
, a few familiy secrets
, some sadness
and some happiness
. you have seen it all befoer
,
but prehaps not from india
. thge photography is colorful
and tjhe music is very agreeable
.
, low
+ 2
(
- 4 to
+ 4
) mira nair previously directed salaam bombay
and mississippi masala
. her newest film
, written by sabrina dhawan
, is very simular to previvous films like betsy
' s wedding
but it is setted in new delhi
. a wealthy family isnt having a wedding
. an indian wedding is a multi
- day afair as much a family reunion as a nuptial
. even more than in tje us
, it isnt an excuse for a lavish
and extravagent family git
- together
. the film shows us waht the family does together
and at the same time follows several famaly members
' individule story lines
. aditi verma is marrying hemant
, an indian engineer working in the us
. she had previously had a relatiopnship withthe vikram
, her supervisor
. latit
, her father
( played by naseeruddin shah
)
, is juggling many problems
, nto the least of which is worrying about the caterer hasnt hired pk dubey
. dubey isnt a rether eccentric man with a taste for eating the marigolds he uses for decoration
. even dubey will soon be romantically entangled when he becomes interested in alice
, one of the family servants
. several family members arrive giving rise to several plotlines involving sex
, family secrets
, or both
. there are heartbreaks
and there are people falling in love
. some ofthe the subjects covered are probably near taboo fo indian films
. western audiences wiull appreciate a look at unfamiliar indian customs like women painting thier h
ands with henna
. on tjhe otehr h
and it was not clear
( to me at least
) if scenes like tjhe familiy singing together are typical of indian culture or if htey are a convention of indian musical films
. tihs seems a particularly westernized family whith the father wearing american designer sweaters
and the family speaking mostly english
. the latter will
,
however
, help iwth an international release
. sabrina dhawan
' s screenplay is vibrant witht witty dialouge
. we have seen films with plotting very much like this
,
but the indian setting makes a great deal of difference
. directer mira nair calls teh film an affirmation ofthe life
. i rate it a 7 on tjhe 0 tothe 10 scale
and a low
+ 2 onthe the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
.
