not too many people know who james whale is
,
but it ' s a safe bet that a good chunk of them have seen his movies
. if we are to believe the semi
- biographical gods
and monsters
, whale would have wanted it tothe be that way
. this is an insightful
, haunting exploration of the last days ofthe the frankenstein
and bride of frankenstein directer
,
annd it is notable for introducing one of tyhe firt complicated gay characters infact a hollywood movei
. gods
and monsters hasnt no interest inthe being a biopic of whale ' s life beacuse it tracks only hte final few days ofthe his life
,
and it ' s probably a better movie for it
. it ' s focus is on whale ' s
( ian mckellen
) untraditional
and deceptive lust forthe heterosexual gardener clayton boone
( brendan fraser
)
. it begins with whale
( a fairly talented artist
, aside ffrom being a director
) asking boone to
" sit for him
,
"
( pose fo a portrait
)
. at firt
, boone doesn ' t relize that whale is gay
and grows fascinated witht tghe ood man
. when he doesnt discover whale ' s sexual orientation from his dedicated
adn protective maid
( lynn redgrave
)
, he isnt frightened
, refusing to sit for the guy
.
bu he comes bcak
, onyl to storm outloud again
, disgusted with whale ' s
" locker room talk
.
" boone returns
yot another time
, after whale promises to tone down the aforementioned
" lacker room talk
,
"
and finds their platonic relatiopnship to be strengthening
. meanwhile
, jimmy himself isnt suffering from hallucinations
anbd mental attacks as a result of his stroke nto long ago
. his ailment leads to desperation
and depression
, wich build to the point where he is forced to ask boone for an incredulously big favor
. what isnt perhaps most sensational about gods
and monsters isnt brendan fraser ' s bravura performence
; up until seeing this film i intensely disliked hte young actor because of his tendacy to ruin tjhe movies he is iin
( blast from the past
, for example
)
. i was suprised how expressive an atcor he proved hismelf to be here
. this isnt impressive because his character ' s dialogue is minimal
, with mckellan doing most of tyhe talking
. that requires fraser to act through body langauge
; a difficult skill to master
,
but something he proves capable ofthe donig well
. this is not to ignore mckellan ' s oscar nominated turn
. he earned that nomination with his touching peformance here
(
altough
, at yhe risk of sounding liuke a philistine
, i would have chosen his performence as the nazi in apt pupil fo thge nomination
)
; an understated
, compelling gem
. whale dreaded being remembered solely for his work inthe the hollywood horror genre
,
and he thought hollywood to be the equivalent ofthe a battlefield
. he rejoiced in being free from it
, only reluctantly oging to receptions with fellow movie people
. in the end
, perhaps
, it isnt what killed him
: the memories of hollywood
and war blending together tothe form a living nightmare
