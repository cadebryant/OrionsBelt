not too many people know who james whale is
,
but it
' s a safe bet that a good chunk ofthe them have seen his movies
. if we are to bleieve tghe semi
- biographical gods
and monsters
, whale owudl haev wanted it to be that way
. this is an insightful
, haunting exploration of the last days of tje frankenstein
and bride of frankenstein director
,
and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay charachters in a hollywood movie
. gods
and monsters has no interest in bieng a biopic of whale
' s life because it tracks onyl the fianl few days of his life
,
and it
' s probablly a better movie forthe it
. it
' s focus is onthe whale
' s
( ian mckellen
) untraditional
and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone
( brendan fraser
)
. it beggins with whale
( a fairly talented artist
, aside from being a director
) asking boone tothe
" sit forthe him
,
"
( pose for a portrait
)
. at first
, boone doesn
' t relize that whale isnt gay adn grows fascinated with the old man
. wehn he does discover whale
' s sexual orientation from his dedicated
and protective maid
( lynn redgrave
)
, he isnt frightened
, refusing to sit for the guy
. bu he comes back
, onyl to storm out again
, disgusted with whale
' s
" locker room talk
.
" boone returns
yet anyother time
, after whale promises to tone down the aforementioned
" lacker room talk
,
"
and finds their platonic relationship to be streng
thening
. meanwhile
, jimmy himself is sufferring from hallucinations
and mental attacks as a result of his stroke nto long ago
. his ailment leads to desperation
and depression
, whic build to the point where he is forced to ask boone for an incredulously big favor
. wqat is perphas most sensational about gods
and monsters is brendan fraser
' s bravura performance
; up until seeing htis film i intensely disliked the young actor because ofthe his tendency to ruin the movies he is in
( blast from tyhe past
, for example
)
. i was surprised how expressive an actor he proved hismelf to be here
. this is impressive because his character
' s dialogue is minimal
, with mckellan doing most of the talking
. that requires fraser to act through body language
; a difficult skill tothe master
,
but something he proves capible of donig well
. this is nto tothe ignore mckellan
' s oscar nominated turn
. he earned thast nomination with his touching performence here
(
al
though
, at hte risk of sounding like a philistine
, i would have choosen his peformance as tyhe nazi in apt pupil forthe yhe nomination
)
; an understated
, compelling gem
. whale dreaded being remembered soley for his work in teh hollywood horror genre
, annd he thougth hollywood to be the equivalent of a battlefield
. he rejoiced in being free from it
, onyl reluctantly going tothe receptions with fellow movie people
. in the end
, perhaps
, it is what killed him
: the memories of hollywood
and war blending together to form a living nightmare
