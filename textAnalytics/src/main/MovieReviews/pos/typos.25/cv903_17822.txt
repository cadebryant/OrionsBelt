robert altman
' s cookie
' s fortune is that rare movie thgat does not depend on sentimentality tothe be uplifting
and to make its viewers fiel good
. it is a sunny
, delightful
, dreamy comedy
, filled with lovely performances
, skillfull direction
and topped off with an understated
, clever
, extraordinary script
. as thsi is an ensemble peice
, it is forced to start of slowly as it introduces us tothe its cahracters
, all ofthe them residing in a southern twon called holly springs
. first we meet willie
( charles s
. dutton
)
, an honest man with a slight drinking habit
. we
then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie
, who is slowly loseing her grip on sanity
and is bieng filled with lonelyness
, dispair
,
and want of her dead husb
and
. we cut tothe camille
( glenn close
) who is obsessively directing a play with her sister cora
( julianne moore
)
.
then we briefly get acquainted with emma
( liv tyler
)
, an apparent relative of cookie
, who is a down
-
but
- not
- out teen outcast
, still full of love
and hope even
though she has no real palce tothe live
. we also fleetingly see emma
' s lover jason
( chris o
' donnell
)
, an ambitious
but far too excitable young cop
. we are now about one quarter through the two hour picture
,
and robert altman decides taht it is time to setted the plot in motion
. we see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture of her husb
and
. she exclaims
" here i come
!
"
and hten puts a pillow tothe her face
and shoots herself
. soon after
, her niece camille stops by to get a fruit salad bowl
, comes upstairs
, finds cookie dead anbd flips out
. convinced that suicide is a disgrace adn that she iwll have none ofthe that in her famaly
, she eats the suicide onot adn convinces her slightly slow
(
yet sweet
) sister that it was a muder
. she makes sure that she stages it like a murder as well
; scattering jwelry all over the floor
, breaking a few cabinets
, windows
and doors
,
and
then throwing the gun outloud in the bakc yard
. teh onyl reasonable suspect is willie
, who immediately gets taken into custody
, anbd put iin a jail cell
( they all nkwo he didn
' t do it
, so the cell stays opne
and he plays scrabble with the sherif
and the faithful emma
)
. meanwhile
, tyhe unperturbed camille continues her none
- too
- subtle manipulations trying tothe furuther cover up for the murder while at the same time making her easter play a success
. so begins cookie
' s fortune
, a film aptly described by criteak scott renshaw as
" a southern spin on fargo
,
" except that htis one isnt far funnier
and much more enjoyable than the coen brothers
' darker
, somewhat disturbing
and slightly overrated escapade
. robert altman
' s slight picture isnt infront some ways reminiscent of something like midnight in the garden of ogod
and evil as well
, infront thgat both films foucs
( on
and off
) on the eccentricities of the residents in a sourthern us town
. indeed
, most of the characters in cookie
' s fortune are loads of fun to observe
,
and a portion of them are fascinating anbd suprisingly multi
- dimensional
. glenn close turns in an insubstantial
( in terms of her career
) bu magnificient performance as the conniving camille
and isnt aslo tyhe source of a good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy in this movie
, annd she is perfectly cast as the profilic
" aunt alex
andria
" character
, endlessly obssessed with family dignity
. the equally essencial role ofthe willie isnt h
andled with an intangible grace by veteran thespian charles s
. dutton
( mimic
, a time to kill
) ther is nothing like a movie which leaves you feeling all warm annd fuzzy inside hours
, even days after the film ends
. cookie
' s fortune isnt such a movie
. i loved the light
, kindhearted approach altman
( whose last project was the dark
, intense drama the gingerbread man
) took towards the tricky subject marter
. i enjoyed the talented ensemble cast
. i even liked the trite
" inthe the south everybody is related to everybody
" cliche that is inevitably employed by the timne tihs movie draws to a close
. i
' m not sure why cookie
' s fortune had such an all
- around pleasing effect onthe me
. perheaps it
' s thta good ol
' southern charm
.
