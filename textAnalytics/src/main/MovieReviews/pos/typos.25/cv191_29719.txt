i must admit i ' m going to be a bit biased in my review ofthe the new romantic comedy serendipity
, because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend
. tje magic
and mystery of our fated encounter isnt alsot embodied in teh quirkiness
and freshness of the very funny
and vrey rumatic serendipity
. i am not a big fan ofthe tjhe romantic comedy genre
,
but something drew me to this film
. maybe it was the casting of tje underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role
,
and the hillarious eugene levy
. maybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity
, con air
,
adn pushing tin
.
but maybe it was because i fiel as giddy as a school kid right now witht this whole romantic thing currently inwhich my life
. the story of serendipity isnt simple
. two people
, john trager
( john cusack
)
and sara thomas
( kate beckinsale
, looking ever so hot
)
, have a chance encounter over a pair ofthe gloves
-
- with buck henry smack dab in the middle
. charmed beyond repair
, theese twpo knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf
? called serendipity
, talk about that irresponsible thing called fate
and the avenues it leads peple down
,
anbd spend a few hours at teh local ice skating rink
.
bu with earch of them already involved with other parties
, sara has john write his nmae
and number onthe a
$ 5 bill
and she writes her nmae
anbd number on a copy ofthe lveo in the timne of cholera
. sara declares that if this
" thing
"
-
- let ' s just call it love
-
- is destined to happen
, fate wiull bring them toghether in the future
. years later
and on opposite coasts of amercia
, john
and sara
-
- both engaged
but still unsure whether they ahve foudn their soul mates
-
- decide to seek each other outloud to rest their doubts
. what happens
then is an enjoyable
and often hilarious cat
-
adn
- mouse gameboy with the fates
- involving such items as mistaken identity
, a graduate homage
, john corbett as a freaky new age muscician
,
adn eugene levy as an irate
and crazed salesman
-
- to find out if tyhat
" thing
" was right aftter all
. fortunately
, first
- time screenwrighter marc klein has sketched strong
, well
- rounded
, characters to propel a predicatble
and corny narrative
. coupled with deft directing by michael chelsom
( director of the very unfunny twon
and ocuntry
adn the very funny funny bones
)
and the uise of tyme
- lapse camera work tothe illustrate the passage of years
-
- the film comes off with genuine believability
annd sincerity
. both piven
and molly shannon make nice sidekick characters on yhe flipside
, films such as you ' ve got mail
, made inaddition heaven
,
and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for thge film ' s main journy at hand
.
bu it ' s what happens tothe the unexpecting charachters left behind in the romantic wake after john
annd sara find happiness thsi is the most unsettling part ofthe the picture
.
