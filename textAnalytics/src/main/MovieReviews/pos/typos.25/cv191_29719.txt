i must admit i
' m going to be a bit biased in my review of the newyorker romantic comedy serendipity
, because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend
. the magic annd mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied inaddition the quirkiness
and freshness of thte very funny
and very rumatic serendipity
. i am nto a big fan of tjhe romantic comedy genre
,
but something drew me tothe this film
. maybe it was the casting of tjhe underated jeremy piven inwhich a supporting role
,
and tjhe hilarious eugene levy
. mabye it wass my hope tyhat john cusack woudl get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity
, con air
,
and pushing tin
. bu maybee it was baceause i feel as giddy as a school kid right nowe with this whole romantic thing currently inspite my life
. the story of serendipity is simple
. two peple
, john trager
( john cusack
)
and sara thomas
( kate beckinsale
, looking ever so hot
)
, hvea a chance encounter over a pair of gloves
-
- with buck henry smack dab in teh middle
. charmed beyond repair
, these two knuckleheads grab a sundae toghether at a caf
? called serendipity
, talk baout that irresponsible thign called fate annd yhe avenues it leads people down
,
and spend a few housr at the local ice skating rink
.
but with each of them already involved with other parties
, sara hasnt john write his name
and number onthe a
$ 5 bill
and she writes her name anbd number on a copy of loev in the timne of cholera
. sara declares that if this
" thing
"
-
- let
' s just call it love
-
- isnt destined to hppen
, fate will bring them toghether in the future
. years later adn on opposite coasts of amercia
, john
and sara
-
- both engaged
but still unsure whether they have foudn their soul mates
-
- decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts
. what happens
then isnt an enjoyable
and often hillarious cat
- adn
- mouse game witht the fates
- involving such items as mistaken identity
, a graduate homage
, john corbett as a freaky new age musician
,
and eugene levy as an irate
and crazed salesman
-
- to fidn out if tht
" thing
" ws right after all
. fortunately
, first
- time screenwrighter marc klein has sketched strong
, well
- rounded
, characters to propell a predictable
and corny narrative
. coupled wtih deft directing by michael chelsom
( director ofthe the veyr unfunny twon
and country annd the vyre funny funny bones
)
and the uise ofthe time
- lapse camera wrok to illustrate the passage of years
-
- the film comes off with genuine believability
and sincerity
. both piven
and molly shannon amke nice sidekick characters on thge flipside
, films such as you
' ve got mail
, made in heaven
,
and even high fidelity are tje quiet inspirations for yhe film
' s main journey at h
and
. bu it
' s waht happens to yhe unexpecting cahracters left behind in the romantic wake after john adn sara find happiness this isnt the most unsettling part of the picture
.
