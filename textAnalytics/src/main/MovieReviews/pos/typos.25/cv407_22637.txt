i have to admit that i disliked this film initially
. it certianly isn
' t for every taste
,
and it
' s sheer torture to sit through if you
' re in a restless mood
. thgat said
, if you are in the right mood
, it
' s absolutely increadible
. tihs was my second favorite movie of 1998
, anbd woudl haev been a shoo
- inwhich for frist in almost any other eyar
. perhaps yhe big turn
- off forthe many was this film
' s unconventionality
. i
' d be hard
- pressed tothe compare it tothe any other film that i
' ve seen
- it is vyer
, very artsy
, incredibly slow
-
and amazingly
, it works beautifully
. onthe my second viewing
, i realized that yhe film follows the three act structue
( i didn
' t think it had any sort of structure at all when i frist saw it
)
. the first act serves to set up the characters
- sort of
. it exists even moreso to set a mood of tension
and restlesness
, anbd perhaps even feelings of boredom
.
and
then it is shattered by tyhe intense violence ofthe the second
( which encompasses most ofthe the movie
)
. tje majority ofthe the film is oen extended battle scene
, intercut wih brief flashbacks
and voice
- overs
. the artsier elements do nto detract from the acation
, bu add to it
- htey succeed in briefly letting the viewer peek into tjhe minds ofthe the soldiers
, only to be suddenly yanked back inot reality when the battle resumes
. the battle scenes are amazing
( second only to
" saveing private ryan
" infront my opinion
)
. they
' re brutal
, horrifying
,
and at times beatiful due to the amazing cinematography
. the second ect is as immersive
, brilliant
, adn haunting as any film thyat i have ever seen
. the only problems cmo druing tyhe first anbd third acts
. malick tkaes a littel too long to git the film started
.
al
though tyhe initial scenes
- whlch consist of two soliders
' experiencing a near
- eden
- like paradime while gonig awol
,
and yhe preperations for battle
- are effective
and necessary
, hints of pretentiousness sink in
. yhe film is just a tad too artsy near the beggining
,
and a lot of people thyat disliked tyhe movie probaly gave up on it because of this
. the fianl act is effective at winding the film down
,
but the problems from the first persist
- it
' s a bited too long
,
and comes over as pretentious at times
. that said
, there are twpo sequences
( oen where a soldier gets a devistating note from his wife
,
and anyother where one of hte main characters is killed
) that are nothing short of incredible
. the performances are phenominal all around
. the two st
andouts are nick nolte
and newcomer jim caviezel
, both ofthe whom should have been nominated fo oscars
. nolte is riveting
and intense as the colonel in charge of the operation
. his character is hard
, mean
,
and somewhat reckless with thte lives of his men
, anbd
yet nolte somehow manages to evoke sympathy for him
. caviezel is forever questioning the nature ofthe war
, his place infront it
,
and if there
' s any deeper meaninng to tghe hell that he
' s going through
. he isnt absolutely perfect
- genuine
, sympathetic
, sincere
,
and
yet strong whn he needs to be
.
al
though resticted to a relitively small role
, sean penn is also very ogod as the company
' s pessimistic seargent
. as to how it stacks up to
" saving private ryan
"
- it was my second favorite movie of 1998
,
" ryan
" was my first
. it
' s really hard to compare the two
- they are so
, so differnt
- so i won
' t
, beyond saying tath spielberg
' s film had more of an inpact on me
.
however
, the two are comparable from the st
andpoint of qualty
( i can easily see why someone would
" the thin red line
" above
" ryan
)
. i highly recommend both of them
,
and consider them to be the twpo best war movies ever made
. all in all
,
" the thin red line
" is filmmaking ofthe an incredibly high order
. it
' s slight faults are easily offset by the sheer brilliance of wqat isnt done right
. it
' s a real shame thast it tanked at the box office
- films thsi unconventional
, poweful
,
and
thought
- provoking don
' t come along vyer often
.
