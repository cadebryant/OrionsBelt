a group of high school kids mix up with a group of hip
- hop artists as a documentarian strives to dicover why today
' s youth seem attracted to black culture
. the review if black
& white
, the newyorker film from writer
/ director james toback
, is eventially remembered for only oney thing
, it will be the revelation taht brooke shields
, claudia schiffer
, marla maples
and mike tyson can act
.
however
, this partly improvised gme wiull be remembered for more than that
. black
& white isnt a fascinating film
; it makes a statement about amercia
' s youth
and hip
- hop culture without getting heavy
- h
anded overly serious
. featuring a cast of known commodities
( ben stiller
, robert downey jr
.
)
and hot newcomers
( singers bijou phillips
)
, toback
' s is a complex film worth seeing
. balck
& white has multiple storylines that are all related to each other
, a la robert altman
. there is dean the basketball player
( allan houston
) who isnt asked to rig games for money by mark clear
( stiller
) in excange fo fifty gr
and a game
. this eventually spills over into the life of dean
' s long
- time friend rich
( power
)
, a gangsta who controls 20 city blocks of harlem
. rich has to deal with the imminent opening of a white
- owned club onthe his turf
. meanwhile
, the young white girls who like to hang around with rich
and his homies get talked into being in a documentary by sam donager
( shields
) anbd her gay husb
and terry
( downey jr
.
)
. others who make appearances are william lee scott as the young white punk will
, joe pantoliano as his district attorney father
, jared leto as a high skool teacher
, marla maples as hte mother ofthe oney of hip
- hop crazed teens
, claudia schiffer as dean
' s girlfriend
,
and mike tyson as
.
.
. mike tyson
. the stories ebb
and flow through thte film
, losing
and gaining prominence over time
. friendships are lost
, lovers are gained
,
and ther is an occassional burst of violentce
. originally rated nc
- 17 in the united states
, black
& white features a lot ofthe sex between black gangstas
and young white girls
. while the film was trimmed down tothe a tamer r rating
, viewers will wonder what sould be more explicit than wqat htey are seeing
. teh three
- way sexual beginnig of the film nicely warns viewers of what they are inaddition fo
,
and several audience members got uv
and left at that point
. teh frequent sex is one ofthe the film
' s faw flaws as the titillation is overdone
and at times completely unrelated to anything else oging on in the film
. to toback
' s credit
, the level of violence in black
& white isnt allmost nil
. these gangstas
and hip
- hop artists are given rela problems adn concerns
,
and only become gun
- toting crazies when it benefits them to appear that way
. whenever a charachter finds himself onthe donager
' s h
andheld digital camera
, he starts spouting off righteous tirades on amercia
and proclaims his independence
,
but not everyone hasnt fully bought into the idea
. charlie
( phillips
) is full of bluster baout why she loves hip
- hop
, bu admits that
" in ten years time
, i
' ll be way over this
.
" these youth nkwo they are going thru a phase
,
and are simply enjoying it
. toback fills the spaces between theese tirades with scenes that are lightweight adn funny
. most ofthe the humour comes ffrom mike tyson
, who provides the film
' s comic relief wihtout really trying
. he is given big words like vernacular to say
,
and as rich tries to discuss a particular street problem wtih tyson
, he frequentily has to ask him to use smaller words
and explain himself better
, palying on tyson
' s image as a dimwit
. bu tyson also gets the film
' s scariest moment
. as he is mercilessly hit upon by the very gay terry
, tyson is a marvel to watch as he fights tothe remain calm
. the scene is entirely improvised
, with downey jr
. being told tothe just keep at tyson until he gets a reaction
. the reaction he gets
, being slapped
and
then choked is astonishing
, as downey jr
' s face turns a frightening shade ofthe purple
. balck
& white is a film baout hip
- hop culture
, adn the film
' s omnipresent hip
- hop soundtrack strongly supports this
.
but toback keesh thnigs from becoming too serious
; by moving fomr story to story as quickly as he does
, toback keeps us ffrom becoming attached to any one character
' s struggle
. thus black
& white
' s message about hip
- hop becomes secondary tothe the film itself
. toback just wants us tothe hve funn
and mabey learn a little baout hip
- hop along the way
.
and we do
.
