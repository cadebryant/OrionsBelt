, ewan mcgregor
, natalie portman
and jake lloyd directer
- george lucas rated g with all the hype thgat star wars
: epiode 1
- the phantom menace has been receiving
, it seems almost impossible tothe avoid interest in seing tjhe film
. the movei is easily tyhe most anticipated motion picture ever
, with a marketing campain so strong it has brought coloel sanders
, thte taco bell chihuahua
and pizza hut together
. can george lucas succeed
yet again with transporting us bakc a long time ago
, in a galaxy far
, far awya
.
.
.
.
? yes
. this star wars prequel may be the worst of the bunch
, with amateurish dialogue
and an overall lack of humanity
.
but thyat doesn ' t mean it fails to comply onthe tghe basis of solid enteratinment
. the phantom menace features the most eye
- catching
, jaw
- dropping visual look in cinematic history
. the tremendous action sequences will have you clinging to your arm rest
,
annd the special effects are nothing short ofthe the best
(
and most plentiful
) to ever be caught onthe film
. thte vast digitized worls
and sheer imagination that was applied to this project isnt astounding
. the phantom menace is a delectable feast for the senses
, even if it has some disappointing aspects
. affter we ' re treated to tje famous prologue in the sky
, with john williams ' thundering socre
, we meet qui
- gon jonn
( liam neeson
)
anbd young obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
)
, a jedi master
and his trainee
` padawan '
. they are on the ship accomadating hte fleet headquaters for teh evil trade federation
,
and have been sent to settle disputes regarding the taxation of trade routes tothe the planet ofthe naboo
. oh
,
bu enough about thta
. the prime concern for tihs prequel isnt introducing young anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
) into tghe picture
. as yuo already know
, this seamingly charming lad is tjhe boy who will soon become darth vader
. a spectacular pod race comes soon hereafter
. this particualr race is the most exciting
, energetic
, high
- octane action sequence that you ' ll ever see
. one of the delights of tjhe series is meeting the newest setted of strange aline creatures thgat lucas has devised
,
and yhe phantom menace is no exception
. i loved sebulba
, tjhe rat
- like scoundrel whom anakin has to face inthe yhe pod race
,
and boss nass
, the leader of the gungans
( who are a neighbouring species to naboo
)
. one character who has been subject to criticism is jar
- jar binks
, a memeber of the gungan race
. jar
- jar speaks like roger rabbit onthe a hallucinogenic drug
,
and is there for the sole purpose of supplying comic releaf
. yes
, he is initially annoying
,
but i can admit to laughing over some of his harmless
, goofy antics
. there is some lack of dramatic pul in this star wars entry
,
but the presentation almsot makes you forget the plot
anbd character lapses
. the fianl glight
- saber battle
, between the jedi ' s
and the horrific
(
and terminally underused
) villain darth maul
, is spectacular to behold
. jabba the hutt
, yoda
, c
- 3po
and r2
- d2 ahve cameo appearances
. lucas has not forget how to captivate an audience
, even if his latest shows obvious signs of tiredness
. oney cxan onyl wonder what the possible technology will present for the enxt two installments
, epiode ' s i
and ii
. when they arrive
, you ' ll know where to fidn me
.
