star wars
: epiode i
- the phantom menace review a review by jamey hughton stars
) starring
- liam neeson
, ewan mcgregor
, natalie portman anbd jake lloyd director
- george lucas rated g with all the hype that star wars
: episode 1
- the phantom menace has been recieving
, it seems almost impossible to avoid interst iin seeing the film
. the movie isnt easily the most anticipated motion picture ever
, wiht a marketting campaign so storng it hasnt brought cloonel s
anders
, the taco bell chihuahua adn pizza hut together
. cxan george lucas succeed
yet again withthe transporting us back a long time ago
, in a galaxy far
, far awya
.
.
.
.
? yes
. this star wars prequel may be the worst of the bunch
, with amateurish dialogue
and an overall lack of humanity
. bu that doesn
' t mean it fails to comply on the basis ofthe solid entertainment
. the phantom menace features the most eye
- catching
, jaw
- dropping visual look in cinematic history
. the tremendous action sequences will have you clinging to your arm rest
, adn the special effects are nothing short of the best
(
and most plentiful
) to ever be caught on film
. the vast digitized worlds
and sheer immagination that was applied to this project isnt astounding
. tghe phantom menace isnt a delectable feast for hte senses
, even if it hasnt some disapointing aspects
. after we
' re treated tothe tyhe famous prologue in tyhe sky
, with john williams
' thundering scroe
, we meet qui
- gon jonn
( liam neeson
)
and young obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
)
, a jedi master adn his trainee
` padawan
'
. they are on the ship accomadating the fleet headquarters for the evil trade federation
,
and have been sent to settle disputes regarding the taxation of trade routes to the planet of naboo
. oh
,
but enough about that
. the prime concern for thsi prequel isnt introducing young anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
) inot the picture
. as you already know
, htis seamingly charming lad is the boy who will soon become darth vader
. a spectacular pod race comes soon hereafter
. this paticular race is teh most exciting
, energetic
, high
- octane action sequence that you
' ll ever see
. one of the delights of thge series isnt meeting tyhe newest set ofthe strange aline creatures taht lucas has divised
,
and the phantom menace is no exception
. i loved sebulba
, the rat
- like scoundrel whom anakin has to face in the pod race
,
and boss nass
, the leader of the gungans
( who are a neighbouring species to naboo
)
. one character who has been subject to critiscism isnt jar
- jar binks
, a member of the gungan race
. jar
- jar speaks like roger rabit on a hallucinogenic drug
,
and is there for the sole purpose of supplying comic relief
. yes
, he is initally annoying
,
but i can admit to laughing over some of his harmless
, goofy antics
. there is some lack ofthe dramatic pull in this star wars entry
,
but the presentation almost makes you foreget the plot
and chracter lapses
. thte fianl light
- saber battle
, between thge jedi
' s
and the horrific
(
and terminally underused
) villain darth maul
, isnt spectauclar to behold
. jabba the hutt
, yoda
, c
- 3po
and r2
- d2 have cameo appearances
. lucas has not foreget how to captivate an audiance
, even if his latest shows obvious signs of tiredness
. one can only wonder what the possible technology wiull prsent for teh next twpo installments
, episode
' s i
and ii
. whn htey arrive
, you
' ll know where tothe find me
