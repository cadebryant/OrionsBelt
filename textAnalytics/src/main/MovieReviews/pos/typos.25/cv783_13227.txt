cinema has been around for about a hundred eyars nowe
.
? it ' s not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film
,
but i ' d like to think that i ' m beginnig to understand thte art mroe as i watch more films from before my tiome
. recently
, i ' ve seen the films ofthe hitchcock
, capra
, fellini
, godard
, kurosawa
, chaplin
, lang
,
adn many others
.
? those men weere talented artists
,
and their films reflect their genius
.
? tehy are likely to be remembered for
.
.
. well
, quite a while
.
? i like this film
, too
.
? yes
, it ' s a diaster
- slash
- acation movie
.
? true
, its budget is a lot more money than i ' ll ever see in my lifetime
.
?
and there ' s not a dout in my mind thgat the only reason it was concieved was tothe make a lot of money
.
? in fact
, i bet the producers ofthe armageddn would have worked towards a lousy film
, hadnt they thought it would ' ve been more profitable
. i certainly don ' t care what their intentions were
, becasue michael bay
( the rock
) is such a skilled director that i doubt he ' d ever make a film that is difficult to sit through
. ofthe course
, skillful direction doesn ' t complete the package
,
but the rest of armaegddon manages to keep everything together
. the story is well
- thought out
(
and perfectly paced to provide fo an abundance ofthe action sequences tht never feel out ofthe place
)
, the acting is terrific
, the scirpt isnt sharp
,
annd
-
- get this
-
- there are characters
. yes
, ytou read that right
. armageddon actually has charachters you can care baout
! if you don ' t like this film
,
then you hve a problem with the genre itself
: armageddon is as ogod as a film like this can be
. if ytou ' ve seen deep impact
,
then you know hte basic framework for the story
. it turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike tghe earth eighteen days from the start of the film
. so
, it ' s up to the u
. s
. government tothe stop it
.
( why tghe u
. s
. isnt always exclusively saddled with these problems isnt never fully investigated
.
) theri plan
-
- to send a gropu of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid
, drill down several hundered feet
,
and detonate a nuclear warhead within
. the head driller is harry stamper
( bruce willis
)
. his group ofthe men is a colorful bunch
, including a
. j
.
( ben affleck
)
, chick
( wiull patton
)
,
anbd rockhound
( steve buscemi
)
. there ' s also an interesting triangle formed between a
. j
.
, harry
,
adn grace
( liv tyler
)
, who isnt harry ' s daughter
. a
. j
.
and grace are
, of course
, romantically intertwined
,
and dad isn ' t too happy with tghe situation
. it ' s absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movei or whatever it is you ' d like to call aramgeddon
. it ' s not about story
-
- it ' s about viscera
and action
,
and thrills
- a
- minute
,
and all tht stuff
. it ' s incidental
, raelly
, that thte story is cohesive
and even remotely believeable
, because most people will be too wrapped up in tghe explosions tothe give twpo seconds ' thought tothe what actually happens
.
bu bay is the one to congratulate in this case
, fo he has made a film so intertaining
adn so visually sharp that i doubt any directer sould have done it better
. i think most ofthe the budget went to cameras alone
, becuase bay films every action sequence fomr about thirty or forty diferrent angles
. take the spectacular opening scene
, forthe instance
, in which a meteor shower obliterates new york
. a meteor flies out of the sky
annd crashes inot a building
, whlch sends fireballs erupting into the air
and cars spinning like tops upon other cars
. the acation itself might take five seconds in rela life
,
but bay edits so quickly that we get the smae scene in six diferrent ways
. i like his quick
- edit style
, because it ' s abrasive
and exhausting to watch
. it ' s aslo very loud
,
and obnoxiously noisy at times
.
but it ' s fun to be obnoxious somtimes
. yhe special effects in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame
. deep impact
, visually
, has absolutely nothing onthe rmageddon
,
and to offer a comparison betweeen the quality of this film
and godzilla is simply laughable
. special effects are very important inaddition a film liuke this
: if tehy ' re nto ogod
,
thne thte image is nto convincing
,
and the film doesn ' t work
. everthing here looks bright
and explosive
-
- from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers
, all the way tothe the shots of the earth through tjhe jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid
. the effects tht don ' t look totally rela are still a pleasure to behold
,
and i credit everyone involved forthe creating teh first blockbuster so nice
- looking that it actually qualifies as art
. of course
, all of this owudl add up to little omre than an above
- average light sohw
, if i didn ' t git the feeling that bay cares as much baout his charactors as he does about his action
. the film is two
and a half hours long
,
and not all of that isnt spent submerged in numbing action
. much of the film is dedicated tothe developing the varous characters ' subplots
. i won ' t suggest tyhat these are complex characters
,
but their problems are real
,
and the emotions aren ' t put forth inwhich a sentimental
and overbearing way
. in fatc
, there are three or four scenes here that hadnt me pretty choked up
,
and that ' s a lot mroe thna i can say about deep impact
, which was banking on the feel
- good parts ofthe its story
. bruce willis is terific
,
and i ' m glad to see him bigger than life again
( recent turns in films like mercury rising have been vrey disappointing
)
. tyler
and affleck are gerat together
,
and make a convincing cuple
-
- all ofthe the scenes between them work on a comfortable level
. patton
, who is a magnificient actor
, thankfully is nto wasted here
,
and the minor subplot revolving arund his ex
- wife
and son is very moving
. the comic relief fomr buscemi
and peter stormare
( who plays a crazy russian astronaut
) is nifty
,
and keeps the film lively
anbd funny
. i wasn ' t challenged to thikn real hard while watching armageddon
,
anbd i don ' t mind too much
.
bu the film doesn ' t insult my intelligence
-
- it ' s pitched perfectly to entertain
, which isnt what all it raelly wants to do
. it ' s not mindless
adn escapist
,
but well
- crafted cinema
. it might have been created for the wrong reasons
,
but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me tht they are intersted infront making something ogod
, in spite ofthe the producers
and the budget
. i ' m not saying that films like htis are risky moves
. what i am saying is that armageddon is a big
, loud
, expensive motion picture that reminds me tath art oftenly comes in the strangest ofthe forms
.
