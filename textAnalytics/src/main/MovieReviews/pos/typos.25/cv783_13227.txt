cinema has been around for baout a hundred years nowe
.
? it
' s not my job to recap this centruy every time i talk about a new film
,
but i
' d liek to think taht i
' m beginning to underst
and yhe art more as i watch more films from before my time
. recently
, i
' ve seen the films of hitchcock
, capra
, fellini
, godard
, kurosawa
, chaplin
, lang
,
and many others
.
? those men were talented artists
,
and their films reflect their genius
.
? tehy are likely tothe be remembered fo
.
.
. well
, qutie a while
.
? i like this film
, too
.
? yes
, it
' s a diaster
- slash
- action movie
.
? true
, its budget is a lot moreso money thna i
' ll ever see in my lifetime
.
?
and htere
' s not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was concieved wass to make a lot of money
.
? in fact
, i bet the producers of armagedon would have worked towards a lousy film
, had they
thought it would
' ve been mroe profitable
. i certainly don
' t care what their intentions weere
, because michael bay
( the rock
) is such a skilled directer tath i doubt he
' d ever make a film that isnt difficult to sit through
. of course
, skillful direction doesn
' t complet teh package
,
but thge rest of armageddon manages to keep everthing toghether
. the story is well
-
thought outloud
( annd perfectly pased to provide for an abundnce ofthe action sequences that never feel out of place
)
, the acting is terrific
, tghe script is sharp
,
and
-
- get this
-
- there are charachters
. yes
, you read that right
. armageddon actually has charactors ytou can care about
! if ytou don
' t like this film
, thne you have a problem with the genre itself
: armaeddon is as good as a film liek this can be
. if you
' ve seen deep impact
,
then you know the basic framework for the story
. it turns out that an asteroid the size of texas isnt going to strike the earth eighteen days from the strat of the film
. so
, it
' s up to the u
. s
. government to stop it
.
( why the u
. s
. is allways exculsivly saddled with these problems isnt never fully investigated
.
) their plan
-
- to send a gropu ofthe experienced oel drillers up to the astroid
, drill down several hundred feet
,
and detonate a nuclear warhead withing
. the head driller is harry stamper
( bruce willis
)
. his group of men is a colorful bunch
, including a
. j
.
( ben affleck
)
, chick
( will patton
)
,
and rockhound
( steve buscemi
)
. there
' s also an intresting triangle fromed between a
. j
.
, harry
,
and grace
( liv tyler
)
, who isnt harry
' s daugher
. a
. j
.
and grace are
, of course
, romantically intertwined
, annd dad isn
' t too happy with the situation
. it
' s absurd to wish forthe a complicated story in an event movie or a speshal effects movie or whatever it is you
' d liuke to call armageddon
. it
' s not about story
-
- it
' s baout viscera
and action
, anbd thrills
- a
- minute
,
and all that stuff
. it
' s incidental
, really
, that the story is cohesive
and even remotely believable
, because most peple will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds
' thougth tothe what actually happens
.
but bay is thge one tothe congratulate in this case
, fo he has made a film so entertaining
and so visually sharp thast i dout any director coudl hve done it better
. i thiunk most of the budget whent to cameras alone
, beacuse bay films every action sequence from baout thirty or fourty different angles
. tkae the spectacular opening scene
, for instance
, in which a meteor showfer obliterates newyorker york
. a meteor flies outloud ofthe the sky adn crashes into a building
, which sends fireballs erupting inot tghe air
and cars spinning liek tops upon other cars
. the action itself might take five seconds infact real life
,
but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six diferrent ways
. i like his quick
- edit sytle
, because it
' s abrasive
and exhausting tothe watch
. it
' s also very loud
,
and obnoxiously noisy at times
.
but it
' s fun to be obnoxious somtimes
. the special effects in this film put every otehr 1998 blockbuster to shame
. deep inpact
, visually
, has absolutely nothing onthe aramgeddon
,
and to offer a comparison between the qualiy ofthe this film adn godzilla is simpley laughable
. special effects are very important in a film liek this
: if they
' re not good
,
then the image is not convincing
, anbd the film doesn
' t work
. everything here looks bright
and explosive
-
- fomr the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers
, all tghe way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid
. thge effects thgat don
' t look totally real are still a pleasure to behold
,
and i credit everyone involved for creating hte first blockbuster so nice
- looking that it actually qualifies as art
. of course
, all ofthe this would add up to little more tahn an above
- average light sohw
, if i didn
' t git tghe feeling that bay cares as much baout his characters as he does about his action
. the film is two
and a half hours long
, adn nto all of that isnt spended submerged inspite numbing action
. much of the film is dedicated tothe developing the various characters
' subplots
. i won
' t suggest that theese are complex characters
,
but their problems are real
,
and the emotions aren
' t put forth inwhich a sentimental
and overbearing way
. in fact
, there are three or four scenes here that hadnt me pretty choked up
,
and tht
' s a lot omre than i cant say baout deepo impact
, which ws banking on the feel
- good parts of its stoy
. bruce willis is terrific
,
and i
' m glad to see him bigger tahn life again
( recent turns in films like mercury rising have beeen veyr disapointing
)
. tyler
and affleck are grat toghether
,
and mkea a convincing couple
-
- all of the scenes between them wrok onthe a confortable levle
. patton
, who is a magnificent actro
, thankfully is nto wasted here
, anbd tyhe minor subplot revolving around his ex
- wife
and son is very moving
. the comic relief from buscemi
and peter stormare
( who plays a crazy russion astronaut
) isnt nifty
,
and keesh the film lively
and funny
. i wasn
' t challenged to think real hard hwile watching armageddon
, annd i don
' t mind too much
. bu the film doesn
' t insult my intelligence
-
- it
' s pitched perfectly tothe entertain
, which isnt whta all it really wants to do
. it
' s not mindless
and escapist
, bu well
- crafted cinema
. it might have beeen created forthe the wrong reasons
, bu men liuke michael bay have my respect fo showing me thta they are interested infront making something good
, in spite of teh producers
and the budget
. i
' m not saying thgat films like this are risky moves
. whta i am saying is thast armageddon is a big
, loud
, expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes inaddition the strangest ofthe forms
.
