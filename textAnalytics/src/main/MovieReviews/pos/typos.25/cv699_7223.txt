and make lude remarks about women
, anytying related to sex
,
and thge music film clips that they watch
. in beavis
&
butt
- head dont america the pair fianlly make their big screen de
but
, to yhe delight of some
,
and the deplore of others
. beavis
&
butt
- head
( yes
, thsoe are their real names
)
, are two very ugly teenagers with extremely warped minds driven by raging hormones
. they live their lives inaddition front of the television
. the worst possible event occurs to the pair when their television is stolen
. thsi happens as htey sleep
,
and when they awake it takes them a fewd mintues just to decipher that thte television hasnt gone
. beavis even tries to use teh remote
,
though there isnt no televsion there
. tyhe two spot a van outside
and two sinister looking men carrying a television
. even at this point they haev no idea what hasnt happened
. they look around
, seing all the evidence
,
but are completely oblivious to hte fact that these men have just stolen their television
. before the movie i knew that tehy were stupid
,
but i didn
' t realise jstu how stupid
. this is typical of their behaviour througout the film
. eventually tehy realise that their television has been stolen
, so they leave theri sofa to go search for a television
. luck owudl have it that htey stumble into a hotel room
( looking for a television
) where a man is awaiting two guys whose task it isnt to kill his wife
. tihs man
, thingking that beavis
&
butt
- head are tghe assigned killers
, tells them that they cxan have
$ 10
, 000 if htey
" do his wife
"
. beavis
&
butt
- head
, being tjhe ignorant fools that they are
, thiunk that he is offering them
$ 10
, 000 dollars to have sex with his good looking wife
. tehy are taken tothe hte airport where they fly tothe las vegas to
" dont her
"
. to them
, this isnt tyhe best day of their lives
. not only are they gogin to lose their virginity
( one ofthe their lifelong aims
)
, bu most importantly
, they will have enough monay tothe buy a big screen tv
. inevitably they become caught up inthe a huge crime
,
and unbeknown to them
, are tracked accross the ocuntry by the fbi
. oddly enough
, it is theri complete stupidity taht spares them from being caught
, as a result teh fbi is conviced htey are criminal masterminds
. they end up travelling right across america
, visiting places such as the hoover dam
and washington dc
. the irony is that
al
though they visit so many gr
and
and spectauclar locations
, their one timne outloud in teh big world away ffrom theri television
, they are completely oblivious to it
. at old faithful tehy are far more fascinated wih thte infra
- red operated urinals than with the guyzer itself
. beavis
&
butt
- head essentially have thte journey of their lives
. htey even get to meet yhe president
. bu all they care about is getting theri television back
,
and losing their virginity
. this is one of the many reasons thgat thte film is so funny
- it
' s unbeleivable just how stupid tehy are
,
and how they can be so oblivious to everything aroud them
. the humour is certainly crude
,
but thn beavis
&
butt
- head are just thgat
; crude
, lude
and rude
. in the end you can
' t help
but feel sorry fo them
, a pair ofthe anti
- social couch potatoes whose life is television
. in this respect
,
and also wih regard to autority
( such as the fbi
) mike judge is quite critical of amercian society
. if you are easily offended
, or find thsi pair particularl annoying
, steer clera
. otherwise
, it should keep ytou laughing tghe wohle way thru
. one note of warning
: don
' t take friends who like to imitate beavis
&
butt
- head
.
.
.
.
. you
' ll never hear the end of it
