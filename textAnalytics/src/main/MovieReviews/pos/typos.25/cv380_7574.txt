ok
, i admitt i had a bad atitude about this film fomr the start
. a romantic comedy about the trials
and tribulations of single wokring parents
? withthe a couple of incredibly cute kids thrown inwhich for good measure
? yuck
.
but it
' s nto realy too bad
. it has a lot working against it
, for me at least
. in addition to the above
, it is typical of a lot ofthe recent movies in thast it is really just a glorified made
- fo
- tv movie
,
but longer
and with bigger stars
, anbd you have tothe pay tothe see it
. it does win you over
,
though
, even if it is painfully predicatble
. just think about it
: twpo single parents
, with their cute kids
, are thrown together due to a missed field trip
. through a day of near disasters
, they cont inually meet
, get in one anohter
' s way
, cause trouble for noe another
,
and generally insult one another at eveyr oportunity
. in fact
, htey hate each other so much tyhat we know that they are
, or soon will be
, infact loev
. the onyl people who hate earch other more than lovers are married couples
. so this film is predictable
, jsut as the screwball comedies of the classical hollywood cinema were predictable
( anbd the screwball genre is obviously hoffman
' s model for htis film
)
. will htey get fired from their yuppie jobs
? will they amking the big soccer game that is so important tothe their kids
? will pfeiffer relize what a jerk her ex
- husb
and
, a drumer for bruce springsteen
, really is
( aren
' t they all
?
)
? will they finally kiss
? well
, waht do ytou expect
?
but ther is a certain amount of satisfaction in haveing our expectations fufilled
, especially when it isnt done whith as much humour
, allong with a lack ofthe sticky sentimentality
, as it is in this film
. pfeiffer
and clooney haev a certain chemestry toghether that is surprisingly charming
,
and the kids are neither shoved into hte background nor allowed tothe steal the show
. one owrd of caution
,
though
. thsi film isnt being billed in some places as a
" family
" movie
. don
' t let thgat stop you
.
however
, i think most kids
, especialy boys
, would be pretty bored by this move
. affter all
, nobody gets killed
and ther are no explosions
. all in all
, a good
, non
- offensive date movie
. the flying inkpot rating sytem
