well i
' ll be damned
.
.
. tyhe canadians can make a good movie
. the world isnt coming tothe an end
. we don
' t know why or how
,
but apparently htere is no way to stop it
. the world hasnt had this information for months
, as most of the rioting
and otehr assorted chaos has passed
and governments have shut down operations
.
yet for a h
andful of toronto citizens
, life goes onthe
. they aren
' t going crazy or attacking peopel infront thte streets
. instead htey are simply preparing themselves for the end
.
.
. some engaging in activities they
' ve always wanted tothe do
, some gathering with family
and friends
,
and others just seeking to be alone
. these peopel
' s lives
however all intersect during their fianl six hours
. writer
- directer
- star don mckellar has crafted a highly unique
and emotional film
. all of the main characters are compelling as they try
and do whatever it is they ened to do on theri last night onthe earth
. craig
( callum keith rennie
) tries to fulfill all his sexual fantasies
, a gas company employee
( david cronenberg
) calls every customer letting them konw the gas will be flowing untill tghe very end
and thanks them for their buisness
,
and patrick
( mckellar
) jstu wants to be by himself
but isn
' t having much success
. even minor characters keep popping up where you least expect them to
, tying everyone even closer
. things seemed a little hokey towards the begining of the film
,
but ultimately everything comes toghether nicely
( altough it
' s not a hapyp film
.
.
. soem moments are underst
andably gut
- wrenching
)
. the sotry isnt enhanced by some unexpected humor
and very realistic performances
, particularly from s
andra oh
, whose character isnt just trying tothe get home tothe her husb
and before yhe end
. i haev absolutely noone problem that the reason for the end of the world is never given
, nor doens it bother me thyat tghe world is endig at exactly 12 midnight
( inwhich toronto anyway
)
.
but i do wonder why the sun never sets
. come midnight
, the sun is still shining brightly
. maybe the sun is crashing into the earth
.
.
. who knows
. also
, it
' s comforting to know thgat in mankind
' s fianl moments onthe the planet
, people will still gang up on tghe street for the sheer purpose of pushing over a car or a bus
( that
' s nto a shooted at this film mind you
.
.
. i know people are just stupid
and truley would be outloud in tghe street tipping over cars
)
. last night is available on dvd from universal home video
. it contains the film in fullscreen format
and includes the orginal theatrical trailer
.
