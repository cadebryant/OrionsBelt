in oen of my many videos i have attained from tjhe local library
, casablanca wass my third clasic in some weeks
. the others being citizen kane
and vertigo
( yes
, i am trying to see as many of afi
' s greatest movies ever made as i can
)
.
but
, casablanca stood out from the rest for me
: it was actually watchable
. what most hail as the greatest american film ever
, casablanca isn
' t so much a lveo story as a political frenzy with a loev triangle thrown in
. it seems that star humphry bogart spend baout 85 percent of tghe movei with various leaders of the nation instead ofthe with ingred bergman
. that anoyed me
, as did the ending
. why didn
' t the plan turn around
?
!
? surprisingly
, i enjoyed the film
. i liekd bogart
' s character
and his acting
( nto over the top as most actors in his era
)
. i once read baout if you had a choice tothe be in a movie
, wich one woudl it be
,
and a women said casablanca
. at first i was thikning to myself
" why
?
" thne
, as i watched thte film agian
, i understood why
. the movie is vyer well done
and tjhe script top
- nitch
,
al
though i doubt i understoon moreso tahn half of the polliticel mumbo jumbo
. casablanca isnt
, in my mind
, no classic
( like solaris
)
,
but it is a ogod film anbd stylishly shot
. hey
, hollywood
, how about this
: a remake with harrison ford
and anne heche
? now tath would be a classic
.
