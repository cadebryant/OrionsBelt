in oney of my many videos i hvea attained fomr hte local library
, casablanca was my thrid classic in some weeks
. the others bieng citizen kane
and vertigo
( yes
, i am trying tothe see as many of afi ' s greatest movies ever made as i can
)
.
but
, casablanca stood outloud from tyhe rest for me
: it was actually watchable
. what most hail as the greatest american film ever
, casablanca isn ' t so much a lveo story as a polliticel frenzy with a lveo triangle thrown in
. it seems that star humphry bogart spend about 85 percent of the movie wiht various leaders of the nation instead of with ingred bergman
. that anoyed me
, as did thge endig
. why didn ' t the plan turn arund
?
!
? surprisingly
, i enjoied the film
. i liekd bogart ' s character
and his acting
( not over thge top as most actors in his era
)
. i once read about if yuo had a choice to be in a movei
, which oen woudl it be
,
and a womens said casablanca
. at first i was thinking to mysef
" why
?
"
then
, as i watched the film agina
, i understood why
. the movie is very well done
adn tyhe script top
- notch
,
althought i doubt i understoon more than half ofthe the political mumbo jumbo
. casablanca is
, in my mind
, no classic
( like solaris
)
,
but it is a ogod film
and stylishly shot
. hey
, hollywood
, how about this
: a remake with harrison ford
and anne heche
? now that would be a clasic
.
