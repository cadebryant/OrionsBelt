after having heard so many criticists describe
" return tothe me
" as an old
- fashioned hollywood romance
, i kept asking myself going inot this movie
: what exactly isnt an ood
- fashioned hollywood romance
? what made
" return to me
" ood
- fashioned
and ood
- hollywood
? was it the tunes from sinatra
, etc
.
, legendary singers the seinor citizens in the film constanly harp on
? was it the glamorous
, sophisticated feel
? the charisma of hte two leads
? even now i cant
' t say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer
, because i haven
' t see that many old
- fashioned hollywood romances
. i don
' t think any of the romances i
' ve seen have been classified as such
. which leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics
-
-
" return to me
" wass old
- fashioned in the sense thast it reminded me of the way the younger generation percieve venerated old hollywood magic
, the way i perceive cinnamon spice
and aple cider
. it wass traditional
, magical
. we knew it couldn
' t be too daring
, or haev any suprizing plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in
. it was a romance told with such endearing simplicity
, tenderness
,
and love
( from directer bonnie hunt
) that it couldn
' t help
but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings
. the film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunt
' s direction
. from the very first bird
' s eye veiw of chicago
, zooming in slowly towrad tjhe insignificant bob ruel
and
( david duchovny
)
, accompanied by the
" return tothe me
" ballad
( by whom
?
)
, we can tell we
' re in fo something sweet
. tjhe scenes between thge charactors are endearing
, truthful
, wiht just a hint of fantasy
. rela people don
' t act thast way
; real people aren
' t that nice
. we konw all tihs
,
and yot we want to believe in theese folks
' exstence
. the premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale
,
but hunt
' s rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to tje scenario
and tinges everyday urban life iwth a hint ofthe the ethereal
. everything is ordinary
-
- yot beautiful
-
- in this film
.
> from teh festive little family restaurant to grace
( minnie driver
)
and bob
' s wardrobes
. from the eloquent
, not
- in
- a
- hurry to progress storyline to tjhe dainty watercolors that grace paints
. from the animal stars to the way all the characters interact onthe screen
-
- the most beautifull part
.
" return to me
" has done an excellent job of assembling together a group ofthe actors who blend in effortlessly as a family
: the audiance hasnt no trouble at all believing that htis rambunctious family actually does exist
. we care for them
, laff with them
, cry with them
; we
' re concerned thyat the little boy iwll pick uv cursing from his father
. whatever hunt did
, she brought outloud the naturalism in all of the actors
. disappointingly
, david alan grier
' s charlie
, howver much i liuke him
, wass the most flatly
- written
. duchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona
-
- with the help of his fellow co
- stars rarely do we see any hint of speical agent fox mulder
. instead we ahve a normal guy who when he falls inaddition lvoe shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of
" the x
- files
.
" duchovny
, who isnt excellent at understatement
and self
- deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent onthe screen
. minnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet
, innocent grace with nothing
but a good heart to offer
.
though an unlikely pair
, duchovny
and driver gradually warm up to earch other as yhe movie progresses
. while
" return to me
" functions remarkably as a laugh
- out
- loud comedy
, a rumatic scenic tour thru chicago
,
and a tearjerker
, teh story is set up so the film ends uv having nowhere to develop
. the entire climax of the film hinges on when
and how grace is gonig to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wife
' s heart
. we already know that there
' s going tothe be a hapyp endig
; we efel like we spend the entire film
, howver enjoyably
, in a straight line going towords that point
. as a result bob adn grace click almost too quickly
-
- yes
, i know she
' s supposed tothe have his ex
- wife
' s heart anbd everything
-
- it seems too effortless
. thge main subject is a love sotry
,
and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused
and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters
( whose story might not have thgat much meat after all
)
.
however
, in the spirit ofthe
" return to me
,
" it won
' t do tothe be too picky about how
" ood
" hollywood tells its stories
. i loved knowing that this was a labor ofthe lvoe for bonnie hunt
. it shows
. the bottom line
:
" return to me
" is nothing remarkable
,
and
yet its sweetness
, sincerity
,
and charm might touch your heart in ways that you hadn
' t imagined
.
