after hvaing heard so many critics decribe
" return tothe me
" as an ood
- fashioned hollywood romance
, i kept asking myself going inot this movie
: what exactly isnt an old
- fashioned hollywood romance
? what made
" return to me
" ood
- fashioned
anbd old
- hollywood
? was it the tunes from sinatra
, etc
.
, legendary singers thte senior citizens in tghe film constantly harp on
? was it thge glamorous
, sophisticated feel
? the charisma ofthe the two leads
? even now i cin ' t sday that i ahve gotten any closer tothe the real answer
, baceause i haven ' t see that many old
- fashioned hollywood romances
. i don ' t think any of the romances i ' ve seen have been classified as such
. which leaves me the option ofthe vaguely agreeing with my fellow criticists
-
-
" return to me
" wass old
- fashioned in thte sense that it reminded me ofthe the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic
, the way i perceive cinnamon spice
and apple icder
. it was traditionnal
, magical
. we knew it couldn ' t be too daring
, or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in
. it was a romance told with such endearing simplicity
, tenderness
,
and love
( from directer bonnie hunt
) tyhat it couldn ' t help
but sparkle wiht charm despite its shortcomings
. the film owes a lot of what it has tothe bonnie hunt ' s direction
. from the vyer firt bird ' s eye view ofthe chicago
, zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland
( david duchovny
)
, accompanyed by the
" return tothe me
" ballad
( by whom
?
)
, we can tell we ' re in for something sweet
. thte scenes between tje charactors are endearing
, truthful
, with just a hint of fantasy
. rela peopel don ' t act tht way
; real people aren ' t that nice
. we nkwo all tihs
,
and
yet we want to elieve in these folks ' existence
. the premise itself seems to ahev sprung out of a fairytale
,
bu hunt ' s rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to tyhe scenario
and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal
. everthing is ordinary
-
-
yet beautiful
-
- in this film
.
> from the festive little family restaurant to grace
( minnie driver
)
anbd bob ' s wardrobes
. from the eloquent
, not
- in
- a
- hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints
. from the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen
-
- tje most beautyfull part
.
" return to me
" hasnt done an excellent job ofthe assembling together a group ofthe actors who blend in effortlessly as a family
: the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exsist
. we care forthe them
, laugh with them
, cry wih them
; we ' re conserned thyat the little boy iwll pick up cursing from his father
. whatever hunt did
, she brung out the naturalism iin all ofthe the actors
. disappointingly
, david alan grier ' s charlie
,
howver much i like him
, was the most flatly
- written
. duchovny here doesnt a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona
-
- with the help of his fellow co
- stars rarely dont we see any hint ofthe special agent fox mulder
. instead we ahve a normal guy who whn he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of
" the x
- files
.
" duchovny
, who is excellent at understatement
anbd self
- deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent onthe screen
. minnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet
, innocent grace with nothing
but a good heart to offer
.
though an unlikely pair
, duchovny
and driver gradually warm up to earch other as the movie progresses
. while
" return to me
" functions remarkably as a laugh
- out
- loud comedy
, a romantic scenic tour through chicago
,
and a tearjerker
, the story isnt setted up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop
. thge entire climax of the film hinges onthe when
and how grace is going tothe tell bob taht she actualyl was the recipiant of his wife ' s heart
. we already knwo that there ' s going to be a happy ending
; we feel like we spend the entire film
,
howver enjoyably
, in a straight line going towards taht point
. as a result bob
and grace click almost too quickly
-
- yes
, i know she ' s supposed to have his ex
- wief ' s heart
and everything
-
- it seems too effortless
. the main subject isnt a love tsory
,
and the family scenes i loev so much unfortunately are overused
and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters
( whose story might not have that much meat after all
)
.
however
, inspite tje spirit of
" return to me
,
" it won ' t do to be too picky baout how
" old
" hollywood tells its stories
. i loved knowing that tihs ws a labor of love for bonnie hunt
. it shows
. the bottom line
:
" return to me
" is nothing remarkable
,
and
yot its sweetness
, sincerity
,
and charm might touch your heart in ways that ytou hadn ' t imagined
.
