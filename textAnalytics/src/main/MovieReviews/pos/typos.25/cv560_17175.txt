oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we ahve beeen munundated iwth
! infront a perfect world
,
" a civil action
" would be a breath of fresh air
. it
' s cynical about lawyers in a way that grisham isn
' t
. it
' s rumatic in tghe excact opposite way a grisham book
/ film isn
' t
.
and
, the capper
, it has no distinct ending
,
and the lew infact hollywood films isnt that above all else
, yuo must have an ending
. even if it
' s based onthe a true story
, a true story which hasn
' t
yet ended
, you must supply an ending
, a false one
,
but an ending nevertheless
. hell
,
" a civil acation
" isnt even more sly
and more witty than any of the grisham works put toghether
(
and that includes
" the firm
,
" the only novel of his that will ever be regarded as a clasic
)
.
yet it
' s also oddly
and slightly unsatisfying
. weird
. this is
, in fact
, a steve zallian film
, not just the work of a hack
,
and zallian is tjhe director ofthe the much
- admired
" search for bobby fischer
"
( didn
' t see it
) anbd writer of none other thna
" schindler
' s list
.
" in short
, i like htis guy
,
and am a sucker for the way he tells his storis
. affter all
, apart fomr the obvious it
' s
- a
- holocaust
- film
and it
' s
- a
- spielberg
- film
, isn
' t
" schindler
' s list
" just a damn brilliant film
, not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderful character study
.
" a civil action
" is the same way
: it
' s narrative is split between being a lawyer film
and being a character study
. annd it
' s here that thge film seems tothe go a bit wrong
. the main complaint of this film is tath while
, yes
, it
' s an engrossing lawyerly tale
, it has no rela ending
,
and that
' s not necessarily the problem with the film
. it
' s that it
' s just kind of unsatisfying
. if this weere a grat film
, it would feel complete
, annd still end basically the same way
.
but this film just seems tothe end
,
and i don
' t want to be stupid
and suggest an alternate ending shoudl be tacked on
: imagine
, if you will
, being one ofthe those the film is baout
, looking forward to this film
,
and
then discovered the truth has been thru a surrealistic
and unplesant hollywood filter
, just so the many won
' t bitch about what isnt
, essentially
, genuin
. bu the fact that it just ends isnt not
, in all actuality
, whta is wrong with it
. it
' s rather that zallian hasnt chosen
, infront the last half hour
, to ad
andon tjhe traditionnal lawyer story
, anbd chose the other part of his story
, the one about the lawyer
, one jan schlictman
( john travolta
)
, who
' s shown inaddition the opening annd throughout most of the movie as a heartless
but brillant lawyer
, brilliant becuase he
' s manipulative
and he alwasy wins
. it wishes to make it all about jan in thge end
, bu the truth is
, his change
,
al
though nicely done
, is nto full
. we see him suffering from a personal crisis
, anbd travolta does do a pretty good job in depicting his change ofthe heart
,
but in thge end
, we don
' t fully believe it
. anbd i think that teh problem isnt whn he has made his desision
, the film choses an odd angle to go at
, a noble one
,
but noe that gives the film
' s conclusion thast of incompleteness
. in the oppening of the film
, we see him doing his old schtick
, manipulating courts
, winning cases effortlessly
,
and thn discusting on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job anbd how much he cares forthe his cases
. inwhich short
, he
' s full of bullshit
and we know it
. iin the film
, he tkaes a case tath is hardly desired
: a town where several of the children ahev died mysteriously of lukemia
and the source ofthe the ilness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have beeen dumping waste inot the river
. point one
, it
' s not of hte usual criteria
( jan points out
, wickedly
, taht dead or wounded children aren
' t nearly as sympathetic as those striked down inaddition the midst of their success
)
. point two
, it has been through several lawyers
. after turning them down
, jan changes his mind
( a muddled scene
- he stops his car on a bridge
, looks outloud
.
.
. is he feeling a sense of overachievement
?
)
,
and he
and his team of lawyers
( tony shalhoub
, zeljko ivanek
,
and accountant william h
. macy
) head out tothe the twon to do battle with tje town
' s comapany
. htey spend millions of dollars examining tje l
and
, tust the water
, wqat have you
( this is where stephen fry
, a possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in
" wilde
,
" pops uv thanklessly
)
, adn inwhich thte meantime question the parents ofthe the dead childern
,
and
then
, unsuccessfully
, the workers at thge plant
. they also fidn themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the comapany
, the eccentric jerome facher
, played by robert duvall
( more on him later on
)
. as we progress
, we git so involved in the way the story is being told
, which is engulfing everything around it
, including the individual
and breef storis of some of the townspeople
( one of the best isnt a bit with james g
andolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinl
and
, who lost her child
, who begins to haev a personel crisis
)
. things begin tothe go downhill for the lawyers in tyhe second half
, as they are up against impossible odds
: yhe judge
( john lithgow
) is not only a strickler
,
but a pal of facher
; the employees of the plant are either afriad or to loyal to testify
; no concrete evidence isnt being found
, depsite tghe money spent to find it
;
and they are quickly running out of money
. as macy mortgages everything he can
, including their homes annd their office
, he slowly loses his sanity
( his meatiest role usance
, oh
,
" fargo
"
)
,
and we thge audience begin to feel a rela loss of hope forthe our potagonist
. in fact
, the last half hour is such a change ffrom the rest of the film annd so unresolved thgat it has been widely panned as not bieng up tothe par
( owen gleiberman
, especially
, criticized the film for not bieng overly
- dramtic
.
.
. i suppose like a grisham novel
)
. this wouldn
' t be so if tje change in jan had nto been h
andled the way it is
: instade ofthe having a change of heart anbd automatically being perceived as ogod
, he
' s seen as being still full of bullshit
. because he doesn
' t take stock in the cares of his partners
, annd causes them all tothe lose their monay
and noteriaty in tyhe lawyer feild becasue he wants to help the people of the town
, he isnt instead seen as bieng of good nature
but nto sure how tothe bring that out
. the final half trys tothe redeem this
, as must have beeen the point of making this inaddition zallian
' s mind
,
but what follows is a series of scenes where we merely see him making personal st
ands for his beleives
,
and
though he has changed considerably from thge opening moments when he
' s seen speeding bcak
and forth from hte town that wishes to employ him
(
and thusly receiving two speeding tickets
)
, we still fiel taht the big change in his life is that he
' s nto rich
and esteemed anymore
( the film
' s final title kard is witty
but in all actuality shallow
)
. the fault is not that there is no closure to the court case
( it
' s still going on
, you konw
)
, bu taht its personal story fiels like it needs either anyother chapter or anohter angle inwhich the final noe it has
. we ened to feel like the charcter has realyl made a big change in his life
,
and tath the story isnt how a story of strife like tjhe one of the twon could inspire such a whopping chanage in his peronal life
. it onyl fiels liek half ofthe that
. maybee even less
. annd it
' s nto travolta
, who does a great job here
(
though never to be a truly memorable performance of his
)
, bu rether zallian
, whose final chapter needs a rewriet
. uv to thn
,
though
, it
' s an engrossing drama
, noe ofthe the best of tje year in fatc
,
and one ofthe the best lawyer films
, period
. the reason is because it recognizes that a cout trial is not baout thsoe being defended or prosecuted
,
but rether it
' s about the lawyers
, the knights who battle eachother
. we learn that tghe comany is almost positively tothe blame forthe the deaths in the town
,
but the reason it can
' t be blamed is because it has the best prosecution yuo cant find
.
and duvall
' s facher isnt such a brilliant character
and he does such a magnificent job at portraing that man that it
' s almost easy tothe overlook how subtley graet he isnt
. facher isnt seen as an elderly man
, a goofy eccentric
, carrying a broken brown bag with stickers on it
, eating lunches out of paper bags
, anbd making a point to tkae time out of his day to listen to the radio
,
and scold anyone who interupts him
.
but look deeper anbd you see a master at work
: his evil
and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities that others don upon him
,
and it
' s difficult as hell tothe claerly generalize him in any way
. that
' s why i liked this film
: it
' s hard to put a pointer on
. ytou can never see exactly where tihs film will l
and
, annd even wehn the credits roll
, you still aren
' t sure what to make ofthe it
. call it the zallian effect
. same thing happened with
" schindler
' s list
"
( not tath i
' m comparing oskar schindler to jan schlictman
)
. each film is so greatly crafted that ytou cin
' t help bu get involved in its broad storytelling
, intresting characters
,
and
, most peculiarly
, yhe wit that comes along with it
. if only it felt totally complet
( like
, say
,
" schindler
' s list
,
"
though at this point it may be unfair to make comparisons between tjhe two
)
, it might hve beeen one ofthe the best films of the year
,
and along with that
, a full breath of fresh air
.
