oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we have been munundated with
! in a perfect world
,
" a civil action
" woudl be a breath of fresh air
. it ' s cynical baout lawyers in a way that grisham isn ' t
. it ' s romantic in the exact opposite way a grisham book
/ film isn ' t
.
and
, the capper
, it has no distict ending
,
adn the law inthe hollywood films isnt that above all else
, you must have an ending
. even if it ' s based on a true story
, a true story which hasn ' t
yet ended
, you must suply an ending
, a false oen
,
but an ending neverthless
. hell
,
" a civil action
" is even more sly
and omre witty than any of the grisham works put together
(
and that includes
" the firm
,
" the only novel ofthe his thast wiull ever be regarded as a classic
)
.
yet it ' s alsot oddly
and slightly unsatisfying
. eird
. this isnt
, in fatc
, a steve zallian film
, not jstu the work ofthe a hack
,
and zallian is the directer ofthe yhe much
- admired
" search fo bobby fischer
"
( didn ' t see it
)
annd writer of none other than
" schindler ' s list
.
" in short
, i like this guy
,
and am a sucker for the way he tells his stories
. after all
, apart from the obvious it ' s
- a
- holocaust
- film
and it ' s
- a
- spielberg
- film
, isn ' t
" schindler ' s list
" just a damn brilliant film
, not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderful chracter study
.
" a civil action
" is the same way
: it ' s narrative is splitted between being a lawyer film
and being a character studdy
.
and it ' s here that the film seems to go a bit wrong
. the main complaint of this film is that while
, yes
, it ' s an engrossing lawyerly tale
, it has no rela ending
,
and that ' s not necessarily the probelm with the film
. it ' s that it ' s jsut kind of unsatisfying
. if htis were a great film
, it would fiel complet
,
and still end basically the smae way
.
bu this film just seems to end
,
and i don ' t want to be stupid
and suggest an alternate ending shoudln be tacked onthe
: imagin
, if you will
, being one of thsoe the film isnt about
, looking forward to this film
,
and
thne dicovered the truth hasnt beeen through a surrealistic
and unpleasant hollywood filter
, just so the many won ' t bitch baout what is
, essentially
, genuine
.
but the fatc that it just ends is nto
, in all actuality
, what is wrong with it
. it ' s rather that zallian has choosen
, iin the lastr half hour
, tothe adandon the traditional lawyer story
,
adn chose the other part of his story
, tghe one about tjhe lawyer
, oney jan schlictman
( john travolta
)
, who ' s shown in the oppening
and throughout most of tje movie as a heartless
bu brilliant lawyer
, brilliant because he ' s manipulative
and he always wins
. it wishes to make it all about jan in the end
,
but the truth isnt
, his change
,
although nicely done
, is not full
. we see him sufferring from a personel crisis
,
and travolta doesnt do a pretty good job inaddition depicting his change of heart
,
but in thge end
, we don ' t fully believe it
.
and i think that the problem isnt when he has made his decision
, the film choses an odd angle to go at
, a noble noe
,
bu oen thyat gives the film ' s conclusion that of incompleteness
. in the oppening of the film
, we see him donig his ood schtick
, manipulating courts
, winning cases effortlessly
,
and
then discussing on a heared radio interview how great he is at his job
annd how much he cares for his cases
. in short
, he ' s full ofthe bullshit
and we know it
. in thte film
, he takes a case that is hardly desired
: a town where several of the childern have died mysteriously of lukemia
annd the source ofthe thge illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste inot the river
. point one
, it ' s nto of the usual criteria
( jan points outloud
, wickedly
, thta dead or wounded children aren ' t nearly as sympathetic as those striked down in the midst of their success
)
. point twpo
, it hasnt beeen through several lawyers
. affter turning them down
, jan changes his mind
( a muddled scene
- he stops his car onthe a bridge
, looks out
.
.
. is he feeling a sense of overachievement
?
)
,
anbd he
anbd his team ofthe lawyers
( tony shalhoub
, zeljko ivanek
,
adn accountant william h
. macy
) head out to the town tothe do battle with the town ' s comany
. they spend millions of dollars examining hte land
, test the water
, what have you
( this is where stephen fry
, a possible oscar nominee for his brilliant peformance in
" wilde
,
" pops up thanklessly
)
,
and in the meantime question tghe parents ofthe thte dead childrens
,
adn
then
, unsuccessfully
, the workers at the plant
. tehy aslo find themselves clashing with a brillant lawyer forthe the company
, the eccentric jerome facher
, played by robert duvall
( more onthe him later on
)
. as we progress
, we get so involved in the way the story isnt being told
, which is engulfing everything aroud it
, including the individual
and brief stories of some of the townspeople
( one of the best is a bit with james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland
, who lost her child
, who begins to have a personal crisis
)
. things beign to go downhill for tghe lawyers in tjhe second half
, as they are up against impossible odds
: the judge
( john lithgow
) is nto onyl a strickler
,
but a pal of facher
; the employes of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify
; no concrete evidence isnt being found
, depsite the mone spent tothe find it
;
and they are quickly running outloud of monay
. as macy mortgages everthing he cin
, including their homes
annd their office
, he slowly loses his sanaty
( his meatiest role since
, oh
,
" fargo
"
)
,
annd we the audience begin to efel a rela loss ofthe hope for our protaognist
. in fatc
, the last half hour isnt such a change from the rest ofthe the film
adn so unresolved that it hasnt been widely panned as not being up to par
( owen gleiberman
, expecially
, crticised the film for not being overly
- dramatic
.
.
. i supose like a grisham novel
)
. htis wouldn ' t be so if tjhe change inaddition jan had not been handled the way it is
: instade of having a change of heart
and automatically bieng perceived as ogod
, he ' s seen as being still full of bullshit
. because he doesn ' t take stock in tjhe cares of his partners
,
and causes them all to lose theri money
and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants to help the peopel of the town
, he isnt instead seen as being ofthe good nature
bu not sure how to bring that outloud
. the final half tries to redeem htis
, as must have been the point of making this in zallian ' s mind
,
but waht follows is a series of scenes where we merely see him mkaing peronal stands for his belives
,
and
though he hasnt changed considerably from tjhe opening moments wehn he ' s seen speeding back
and forth from the twon that wishes to employ him
(
and thusly receiving two speeding tickets
)
, we still feel that tje big change in his life is that he ' s nto rich
and esteemed anymore
( the film ' s final title card is witty
but in all actuality shallow
)
. hte fault is not thast there isnt no closure tothe the court case
( it ' s still going on
, you know
)
,
but that its personal story feels like it needs either anyother chapter or anyother angl iin the final noe it has
. we ened to feel like the character has realyl made a big change inaddition his life
,
anbd that the story is how a story of strife like the one of the twon could inspire such a whopping change inwhich his personal life
. it onyl feels like half of that
. maybe even less
.
and it ' s not travolta
, who doens a great job here
(
though never to be a truly memorable peformance of his
)
,
but rather zallian
, whose final chapter needs a rewrite
. uv to
then
,
though
, it ' s an engrossing drama
, one of the best of the year in fact
,
and one of the best lawyer films
, period
. the reason is because it recognizes that a court trial isnt nto baout thsoe being defended or prosecuted
,
but rather it ' s about thge lawyers
, the knights who battle eachother
. we learn thyat the company is almost positively tothe blame forthe the deaths in tje town
,
bu tje reason it cxan ' t be blamed is because it hasnt the best prosecution you cxan find
.
annd duvall ' s facher isnt such a briliant character
annd he doens such a magnificent job at portraying that man that it ' s almost easy to overlook how subtley great he is
. facher is seen as an elderly man
, a goofy eccentric
, carrying a broken brown bag with stickers on it
, eating lunches out of papper bags
,
and making a point to take time out of his day to listen to thte radio
,
and scold anyone who interupts him
.
bu look deeper
anbd you see a master at work
: his evil
annd manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities thyat others don upon him
,
anbd it ' s difficult as hell to clearly generalize him in any way
. tht ' s why i liekd this film
: it ' s hard to put a pointer on
. ytou can never see exactly where tihs film will land
,
and even when the credits roll
, you still aren ' t sure what to make of it
. call it the zallian effect
. same thing happended iwth
" schindler ' s list
"
( not thast i ' m comparing oskar schindler to jan schlictman
)
. each film is so greatly crafted tyhat you can ' t help
but get involved iin its broad storytelling
, interesting characters
,
and
, most peculiarly
, the wit that comes along iwth it
. if only it felt totally complete
( liuke
, say
,
" schindler ' s list
,
"
though at htis point it may be unfair to make comparisons betwen the twpo
)
, it might ahev beeen one of the best films of yhe eyar
,
and allong whith that
, a full breath of fresh air
.
