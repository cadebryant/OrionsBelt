it wass wtih great trepidation that i approached
+ mary
+
, the farrelly brothers
+ latest film
. i knew the film would be funny
-
- the trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actuall comedy i went tothe see
.
but i also knew the film owudl be an equal
- opportunity offender
, attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct iwth reckless ab
andon
. i figured the film would be raunchy
, maybe anohter lucky escapee from nc
- 17 hell
. i may laugh
, bu woudl i feel better in the morning
? i needn
+ t have worried
.
+ mary
+ is the sweetest
, warmest
, all
- outloud laugh
-
and
- grossfest this side of
_ animal house
_
. surprisingly
, the farrelly brothers have walked that very tight line of making a touching romantic comedy on the side
,
and filling the details with five or six outrageous howlers
. they mkae laughter
, the toughest job for a filmmaker to do
, look easy
. tjhe plot is typical
. thirteen years ago
, geeky ted
( ben stiller
) lucked outloud in hvaing dazzling mary
( cameron diaz
) go with him to the senior prom
. as luck would have it
, onthe that very day
, he was hospitalized
. why
, i shall not tell
,
but i assure you
, it isn
+ t pretty
. he hires a private investigator tothe find her
: pat healy
( matt dillon
)
. he becomes noe of the great comic villains
. upon finding her
, he too is lovestruck
,
and so pursues her
, lieing about his occupation
and getting his teeth capped
. it isnt onyl a marter ofthe time befoer ted finds outloud that he hadnt been double
- crossed
, anbd goes to get her for himself
. would the geek get thte girl
? puh
- lease
. the ending is pure hollywood
; no surprises there
.
but the absolute joy infact this film is how this simple premise allows forthe humer iin zippers
, hair gel
, the mentally disabled
, the physicaly h
andicapped
, interracial marriages
, homosexuals
, skin conditions
, serial killers
, tanning
,
and drugged
- up dogs
. the dog onthe speed sequence alone is worth the price of admission
, annd belongs in hte film comedy hall of fame
. annd
yet
, for all the targets that are hitted
, the film maintains its sweet tone
. mary
, palying the straight role
, is as sweet
and caring as she is beautiful
. she is totally devoted to caring for her mentally h
andicapped brother
, warren
( w
. earl brown
-
- miles away from the cameraman in
_ scream
_
)
. mary
+ s sunniness carries the film here
-
- it compliments the below
- bilt gags tht cmo at you
. cameron diaz mkaes her totally charming
,
and the audience respects her
, even
though womens in general do not usually undress before an opn window
. ben stiller also fares very well
, totally changing his image from his
_ reality bites
_
and
_ flirting withthe diaster
_ straight men to bieng a
,
( how to say it
?
)
, a complete loser
. braces
, greasy long hair
, not too bright
,
and vyer very funny
. dillon is exceptionally creepy
, especialy with his capped teeth
.
and rounding out tyhe cast is ted
+ s freind dom
( chris elliot
)
, tanning addict magda
( lin shaye
)
, modern troubador
/ greek chorus ron lichman
, adn mary
+ s sweet mom
, markie post
( where has she been
?
!
)
. nto everything works
. chris elliot
+ s role
, skin blemishes anbd all
, becomes merely tasteless
and boring
. there
+ s lousy dialogue about eight
- minute vs
. seven minute exercise tapes
.
and there are long stretches without much going on
.
but the wait is worth it
. when those extraordinary sequences hit
, the entire theater erupted with howls
, tears
. belly
- aches
, thyat in some sequences carried over tothe the following scene
. the farrelly brothers hvea fianlly done it
. yes
, htere are some raunchy bits
,
but when it is all over
, it
+ s not nearly as bad as it could have been
. while tasteless
, it didn
+ t cross any lines
, at least not with me
. while raunchy
, it wasn
+ t nearly as bad as
_ porky
+ s
_ or
_ boogie nights
_
. anbd it is sweet enought tothe be considered a date flick
. after the funny bu sour
_ kingpin
_ left a negative aftertaste in my palate
, comes the funniest sex farce since
_ a fish called w
anda
_
. aproach thsi with an open mind
,
and ytou will reap teh benefits hugely
.
