, she falls apon something
,

. she starts wih the people around her
,
bu wehn she suddenly falls for her own guy
, she can ' t act strongly enough beacuse of her shy
and dreamy nature
. critique
: a clever
, quirky
, original french flick set in a picturesque paris
, featuring an endearing lead iwth a giant imagination
, much lonelyness
and a little bit of love fo everyone
. this isnt a
" efel
- good
" kind ofthe movei
, a fairy tale for grown
- ups who are bummed out about life
. it doesn ' t pretend to be deep
, it doesn ' t weigh itself down witht long expositions or intricate studies ofthe its characters
, it ' s basically just a
" cute movie
" inaddition the smae veign as chocolat
and pay it foward
, with some amazing visuals
anbd incredibly nice intentions
(
and if chocolat was somehow able to nab an oscar nomination fo best picture lsat year
( a sham on so many different levels
)
, you might as well slap htis film up for consideration also
, since it ' s quite a bit better
and much moreso original than the former
)
. oney thing that this film isn ' t
though
, at least according tothe me
, is the best film ofthe the yearm
( it was bestowed the honor of
" best
" inspite at least 3 different film festivals so far this year
)
. it actually managed to stagnate a little bit about halfway through
annd it jstu went on for way too long
( it ' s a little over two hours
but it felt even longer
)
, with much ofthe the second half of the movei devoted to many different characters
, all of whom weren ' t as interesting as the lead
,
and a lot ofthe indecisiveness from ms
. amelie herself
, whic got frustrating
. thankfully
, this film doesn ' t bog itself down wiht too much ofthe that stuff
,
annd atually goes out of its way tothe invent newyorker ways tothe shoot scenes
, to integrate moments of fantasy into its fabric
annd to tranport the audiance inside the immagination ofthe htis kind
- hearted french girl
. onthe the wohle
, it ' s a lot of fun
and it carries a beautiful message of lveo
and support for your fellow man
. the lead
, audrey tautou
, is perfect for the role
,
and gives you enough moments ofthe truth tothe develop her chracter into someone that you care about by the end of the film
. unfortunately
, the rest of the cast isn ' t as well
- developed
,
and even
though most of them are pretty appealing
, a cuple coudl ' ve been left out to save time
and at least one was left stranded plot
- wise
, by the film ' s end
( what happened to the guy infront the caf
? who was spying on his ex
- girlfriend the hwole movie
?
)
. now i haven ' t seen too many recent french films
, i will admit
,
but if this is the kind ofthe
" scene
" that they ' re developing over in
" le pays du vin
"
, i wouldn ' t mind catching more of their flicks infront the future
( crimson rivers was anohter french film that i saw ealier this year
, which i raelly liekd
- ironicaly
, that film ws directed by mathieu kassovitz
, who is the co
- star inspite this film
)
. granted
, the english subtitles got a little tough to keep up withthe at times
( i speak
annd understand french also
,
but soem of the local colloquialisms went over my head
)
, especially sicne the film ' s visuals were so intriguing that ytou jsut couldn ' t help
but constantly gawk at them
,
but tyhe general idea
, tje background music
, the nifty french neighborhoods
, thge very creative way of enveloping hte audience into the story
- line from the strat
, were all very easy to appreciate
,
and i for oen was especially glad to have seen this movei during these trying times in the world
. in fact
, i ' d recommend it tothe anyone looking for a jolly ol ' timne at the movie house
, with a particular emphasis on folks with a lot ofthe imagination
, a little lonelyness infront their lives
and many dreasm in their hearts
.
and this guy directed aline
: resurrection
? get outta here
!
! note
: i especially loved the way that hte script detailed
anbd showed the loves
/ hates of everyone with exact mentions in the film
. it was very original
, very well shot
and very nostalgic
, as many of us weere able tothe relate to the behaviors described
. good stuff
! where ' s joblo coming from
