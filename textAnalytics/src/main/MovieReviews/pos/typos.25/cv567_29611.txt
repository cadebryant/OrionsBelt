plot
: a peculure french girl grows up lonely with her father
and doesn
' t quite know wqat she wants out ofthe life
. one day
, she falls upon something
,
and believes that her ticket to happiness may be in helping others
. she starts with the peopel around her
,
but when she suddenly falls fo her own guy
, she can
' t act strongly enough because of her shy
and dreamy nature
. critique
: a clever
, quirky
, original french flick setted iin a picturesque paris
, featuring an endearing lead with a giant imagination
, much loneliness
and a little bited ofthe love for everyone
. this isnt a
" fiel
- good
" kind of movei
, a fairy tale for grown
- ups who are bummed outloud about life
. it doesn
' t pretend to be deep
, it doesn
' t weigh itself down whith long expositions or intricate studies of its charactors
, it
' s basically jstu a
" cute movei
" in the smae vein as chocolat
and pay it foward
, wiht some amazing visuals
and incredibly nice intentions
(
and if chocolat wass somehow able to nab an oscar nomination for best picture last year
( a sham onthe so many different levels
)
, you might as well slap this film up for consideration aslo
, since it
' s qutie a bit better
and much more original than the former
)
. noe thing that tihs film isn
' t
though
, at least according to me
, isnt the best film ofthe the year
( it was bestowed the honor of
" best
" iin at least 3 different film festivals so far this year
)
. it actually managed to stagnate a little bit about halfway through
and it just went on forthe way too long
( it
' s a little over two hours
but it felt even longer
)
, with much of the second half of the movei devoted tothe many different characters
, all ofthe whom weren
' t as interesting as the lead
,
and a lot ofthe indecisiveness from ms
. amelie herself
, which got frustrating
. thankfully
, this film doesn
' t bog itself down with too much of thyat stuff
, anbd actually goes outloud of its way tothe invent new ways to shoot scenes
, tothe integrate moments of fantasy into its fabric adn to tranport the audience inside the imagination of tihs kind
- hearted french girl
. on the whole
, it
' s a lot of fun
and it carries a beautifull message of love
and support for your fellow man
. the lead
, audrey tautou
, is perfect fo tje role
,
and gives you enough moments of truth tothe develop her character into someone that you care about by the end of thge film
. unfortunately
, the rest of the casted isn
' t as well
- developed
,
and even
though most of them are pretty appealling
, a couple sould
' ve been left out tothe save time adn at least one wass left str
anded plot
- wise
, by the film
' s end
( what happened to the guy in the caf
? who ws spying onthe his ex
- girlfriend the whole movie
?
)
. now i haven
' t seen too many receet french films
, i will admitt
,
but if this is the kind ofthe
" scene
" that they
' re developing over in
" le pays du vin
"
, i wouldn
' t mind catching more of thier flicks in the future
( crimson rivers was another french film that i saw earlier this year
, which i really liked
- ironically
, that film was directed by mathieu kassovitz
, who is the co
- star in this film
)
. granted
, the english subtitles got a little tough tothe keep up with at times
( i speak
and underst
and french also
, bu some ofthe the local colloquialisms whent over my head
)
, especially since the film
' s visuals were so intriguing that you just couldn
' t help bu constantly gawk at them
,
but tjhe general diea
, the background music
, the nifty french neighborhoods
, the very creative way of enveloping the audience into the stoyr
- line from the strat
, were all very easy to appreciate
,
and i for one wass especially glad tothe hve seen tihs movie during these trying times in the world
. in fatc
, i
' d recommend it to anyone looking fo a jolly ol
' time at the movei house
, with a particualr emphsis on folks with a lot of imagination
, a little loneliness infact their lives
and many dreasm in their hearts
.
and this guy directed alien
: resurrection
? get outta here
!
! note
: i expecially loved tghe way that the script detailed
and showed thge loves
/ hates of everyone wtih exact mentions in the film
. it was very original
, vrey well shot
and very nostalgic
, as many of us were able to relate to the behaviors described
. good stuff
