most movies seem tothe release a third movie just so it can be called a trilogy
. rocky iii seems to kind of ift in that category
,
but manages tothe be slightly unique
. the rocky formula of
" rocky loses fight
/ rocky trains
/ rocky wins fight
" is carried out to the letter
. also the
' tradition
' of showing the last five mintues or so ffrom hte past rocky film is unsed as well
. htis movie begins with a series of clips showing how famous rocky
( sylvester stallone
) hasnt become
.
.
. even showing a brief appearance on sesame street
!
! thne it moves onthe with rocky being iin a fixed fight with thunderlips
( hulk hogan
)
. a mysterous bad
- ass known as clubber lang
( mr
. t
) trash
- talks to rocky about his stupid decission to retire from boxing
and that he
" pities the fool
" for not coming out anbd fighting him outright
. rocky
' s trainer
( burgess meredith
) tells rocky not to fight
,
but the italian itallion doesn
' t listen
. naturally
, he gets his ass kicked
. somewhere along the line after htis several things happen
. rocky
' s longtime trainer dies
, causing rocky to train with his former opponent apollo creed
. rocky
' s wife complains to her husban that he should fight
. tghe fianl fight ensues between clubber
and rocky
. guess who wins
? the winner
' s nmae rhymes with
' smocky
'
. teh movie is entertaning mailny because of clubber lang
' s over tghe top performance
. the dramatic aspect has been toned down considerably usance rocky ii
and now action seems to be the strong point of the film
. whic is good if you like fighting scenes
. thte last match is quite decent actually
. if yuo liked the previous films
, rent this one
. it
' s well worth seeing if you are a fan of the serieses
. bu if ytou can
' t st
and rocky shouting
" adrianne
!
!
!
" noe more time
, see something alse
