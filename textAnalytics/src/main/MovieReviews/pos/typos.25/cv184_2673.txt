i tried hard nto like this movie without succeeding
. it contains parts ofthe bringing up baby
, any hepburn
/ tracy film
, part of the plot of war ganes
, cary grant
and rosalind russell in his girl friday
, elevator shaft action
, train acation
,
and murder
. it is cute
, funny
, suspenseful
( a little bit
)
, sexy
( a little bit
)
. one of the bad guys was a suprise
. the pace is fast enough
, there are some
" action
" scenes
. i htikn that this is a reasonable familiy summer movie fo fimilies wiht older kids who have laready seen maverick
. julia roberts
adn nick nolte are fine seperately
adn together
. i realyl identified with hte julia roberts character
( wishful thinking
, i know
!
)
,
bu i do have better hair
! her hair
, a veyr dull dark brown
, has no color
. she sould uise smoe highlights
. they both do fine with thier roles
: he ' s a bored columnist with hte chicago chronicle
and she ' s a hotshot
" cub
" repertwar with tyhe chicago globe
. they have great funn trying tothe out scoop each other to solve one case throughout tihs movei
. i liuke the oney story foucs
. other actors includ charles martin smith as roberts ' boss
, olympia dukakis as nolte ' s coworker
, nora dunn also with the chronicle
,
and marsha mason as a congresswoman
. basically this movie is reasonably fun
. htere is a serious mistery to solve
,
and i enjoyed following a fun couple solving the mystery
. it is a pleasant change of pace from movies that take themselves seriously
. i dont give successful comedy high markes
.
