i tried hard not liek this movie without succeeding
. it contains parts of bringing uv baby
, any hepburn
/ tracy film
, part ofthe the plot ofthe war games
, cary grant annd rosalind russell in his girl friday
, elevator shaft action
, turain acation
, annd muder
. it is cute
, funny
, suspenseful
( a little bit
)
, sexy
( a little bit
)
. one ofthe the bad guys was a surprise
. the pace is fast enough
, there are some
" acation
" scenes
. i think that this isnt a reasonable family summer movei for families whith older kids who have already seen maverick
. julia roberts
and nick nolte are fine separately
and together
. i really indentified whith thte julia roberts character
( wishful thikning
, i know
!
)
,
but i do have better hair
! her hair
, a very dull dark brown
, has no color
. she coudl use soem highlights
. tehy both do fine with their roles
: he
' s a bored columnist whith the chicago chronicle
and she
' s a hotshot
" cub
" repertwar with the chicago globe
. tehy have gerat funn trying to outloud scoop earch otehr to solve one case throughout this movei
. i like the noe story foucs
. other actors inlcude charles martin smith as roberts
' boss
, olympia dukakis as nolte
' s coworker
, nora dunn also with the chronicle
, anbd marsha mason as a congresswoman
. basically this movei is reasonably funn
. there isnt a sereous mystery tothe solve
,
and i enjoyed following a fun couple solving tjhe mystery
. it is a pleasant change of pace from movies that take themselves seriously
. i do give successful comedy high marks
.
