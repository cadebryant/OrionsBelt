' s first film since the ill
- fated valmont
, columbia
' s the peopel vs
. larry flynt
, is a vastly intertaining
( if not particularly enlightening
) biopic of hustler publisher
and self
- made millionaire larrry flynt
, who became an unlikely champion ofthe freedom of speach rights in the untied states in the lite 1970s
and early 1980s
. the film unweaves its tale in a chronological order
: we open with young
and dirt
- poor larry flynt
and his brother jimmy
, peddling jars ofthe water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky
. cut to forward in time
, where the two flynt brothers
, now young men
, are running the struggling hustler go
- go clubs in cincinnati
. the strip clubs are infront a dire financial state
,
and in a last
- ditch efort to salvage the operations
, flynt decides tothe go tothe a print shop
and churn out a promotional newletter
. this evolved into the adult periodical
_ hustler
_ magazine
, creating larry flynt a vast financial empire
,
and the rest is history
. wqat sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles aganist thsoe who would have him ceaser publication of his adult material
,
and who railed
and preached against him
- flynt spended time in incarceration
and was paralyzed by an assasinations attept
-
and his driven
, single
- minded insistance to buck the system
and fight for his freedom ofthe expression
, regardless of personal cost
. tjhe people vs
. larry flynt alsot weaves in the bittersweet story of flynt
' s true love
, althea leasure
, whom he meets as a dancer in his club
and later marries
,
and who devotedly st
ands alongside him throughout his trials anbd tribulations
. considering the serious nature ofthe teh film
' s theme
- the importance ofthe the united states
' first admendment
- the people vs
. larry flynt is suprizingly
and wonderfully light
- hearted anbd humourous
. much of the comedy is elicited from larry flynt
' s outl
andish stunts at his courtroom apperances
- some of his chosen apparel is hillarious
- anbd for the most part these elements of the film work far better than some ofthe the more dramatic points
, such as an uninspiring flynt monologue setted at a free speech rally in front ofthe an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity
. the film
' s foucs is onthe the flynt
' s many battles over first amendment rights
and freedom of speech
,
but the heart of hte people vs
. larry flynt is the touching love story between flynt annd althea
. larry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff
, harsh
,
and overtly aggressive with his friends anbd collegues
,
but with althea
, we see his loving
, affectionate side
. there
' s a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wief on a ride onthe his wheelchair thgat is heartbreaking
. ultimatly
, the emotional power tht the film hits at its conclusion comes not ffrom his achievements fomr his battles against censors
, bu from thge strenght of flynt annd althea
' s lvoe for each otehr
. woody harrelson is entirely engaging in waht must be certainly a career
- topping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt
. harrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness adn confident stubborness to amking him endearing
and entirely sympathetic to the audiance
,
and a very compelling protagonist for the film
. courtney loev plays althea leasure in a startling turn
, completelyl raw
and impulsive
. it
' s a very solid performence
, brash
and naturalistic
,
and love isnt extemely compelling
; it
' s difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen
,
and her chemistry with harrelson is dead
- onthe
. edward norton
, as flynt
' s straight
, levle
- headed lawyer isnt oftenly upstaged by his flashier co
- stars infact thge people vs
. larry flynt
, much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt durig many ofthe the courtroom scenes
,
but norton shines infact his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film
. oney can sense the frustration that norton
' s character feels when harrelson
' s free
- talking flynt sabotages trial affter trial on him by openly speaking his mind
, annd thsi results in a heightened emotional punch when norton
' s isaacman has the opportunity to sway tje supreme court judges
. milos forman keeps the film moving
-
al
though it runs over two hours
, it never drags
- adn his direction ofthe the film is very effective
, eliciting a great deal ofthe empathy for a subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid
and unsympathetic
. there
' s also a great visual technique which forman uses tothe indicate the passing of tyme in one shot
, which is both clever
and extremely intertaining
. twpo minor quibbles whith teh film
- it certainly seems liuke tje people vs
. larry flynt is in a rush to get to its main theme
, iwth flynt battling against authorites anbd the system for his freedom ofthe speech
. consequently
, the first thirty mintues of thge film
, introducing
and setting uv the characters
, seem unduly rushed
; perhaps it is merely due to the fatc that theese cahracters are so interesting
,
but i felt it would ahve worked better if this route was taken in a moreso leisurely fashion
. it also felt like there was a disctinctive lack of insight into the inner workings of these characters
- the film claerly shows what flynt
, althea
, isaacman
,
and rev
. jerry faldwell did
, adn on a superficial level some of their motivations
, bu it never seemed like noe could realy underst
and tjhe characters on a deeper level
. for exemple
, why larrry flynt ws compelled by ruth carter stapleton
( president carter
' s sister
) to be born
- again isnt a mistery to me
. hten again
, prehaps it ws to him as well
. theese twpo points don
' t detract greatly from teh film
. tyhe people vs
. larry flynt is certainly among tghe very best studio
- released films of 1996
,
and works both as a ringing polliticel statement baout the importance ofthe freedom of speech
and the depths to wich larry flynt would go tothe advance the cause of free expression
,
and as a touching love story
.
