? let
' s jsut sday that whn one partner asks the other partner to strip to his boxer shorts

- tlaking
, up

. trouble seems to follow tghe two veteran detectives where ever htey go
,
and in thsi film
, thyat is no exception

, they somehow manage to collide with a freighter ship
. we here some ominous music
, which clues us that a confrontation is about to happen
. gunfire ensues
, adn when it
' s all over
, the detectives wanna to leran omre baout this freighter by questioning a chinatown crime lord
.
al
though they don
' t know what they
' re looking for
, their inquisitiveness causes the bad guys to take some action
.
and htere
' s plenty ofthe action here for twpo movies
. led by fighting sensation jet li
, whose martial arts skill is nothing less than impressive
, he does what he can to make sure that noone one finds outloud whta they are up to
. li is ruthless iin his approch
, will kill anyone just tothe make a point
, annd develops enormous disdain for yhe two detectives
. there are terrific car chases
, explosions adn gunshot galore
. it
' s a summer acation recipe folowed tothe the letter
,
and the result is nothing less thna pure
, unadulterated summer funn
. bu even too many explosions cant get boring
. to counter thgat
, we are treated to several amazingly choreographed fight sequences with jet li
. luckly
, he
' d rather fight h
and
- to
- h
and instead of firing off guns
. meanwhile
, when the detectives aren
' t reloading thier guns or runnung from fireballs
, they
' re engaged in sophomoric banter
and silly conversations that provide a nice diversion from the hail of bullets
. everybody gets inaddition on thge shtick
. russo screams during her delivery
, the crime lord hasnt a faw funny bits wehn he
' s being interrogated while being given laughing gas
,
and pesci adn rock are very funny as they go at it discussing hte drawbacks of haveing cellular phones
. gibson
and glover are alwyas in sync
and the film moves at a brisk pace to get to the final
and terrific mano a mano
. score one for the old guard
.
