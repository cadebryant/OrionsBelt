wehn i was growing up in 1970s
, boys in my school utilisied tothe divide inot two groups
, based on their action movies preferences
. the first one
, mysef included
, liked movies that featured spectacular car chases
, lots of machinegun fire
and huge explosions
. the latter one prefered hong kong martial arts flicks
, probably beccause they could
( or
, to be more precise
, throught tehy could
) imitate its stunts iin hte real life
. decades later
, while refining my own cinematic taste
, i began tothe appreciate
and actually liek those movies
, probably becuase of overexposure to shoot
- em
- uv idiocy ofthe 1980s ramboids
. yes
, most of teh kung fu
and other
" martial arts
" ficks were cheap
, they hadnt predictable anbd formulaic plot
,
and asked vyer little of prodcution values aside from martial arts skills
.
but
, infront the same timne
, those movies hadnt thier pwn rules anbd in the h
ands of capible director could become a terrific guilty pleasure annd source of relaxation
. hte best ofthe those movies
, one that passed the test ofthe time
and managed to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon
. made infront 1973 in a joint hong kong
- hollywood venture
, it ws intended to bring bruce lee
' s skills
and kung fu philosophy tothe the western audiance
. it succeeded
,
but it is still debateable whether by its pwn merit or by tghe unfortunate anbd mysterious death ofthe bruce lee tath immortalised the myth about thast actor
. lee plays a quiet shaolin monk who isnt a martial arts expert
. he is approached by interpol offical who asks him to join tri
- annual martial arts tornament that is held on a remote isl
and
, owned
and controlled by han
, renegade shaolin monk
. interpol suspects thyat the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics
, gun
- running
and prostitution operations
and lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities to intervene
. lee accepts hte mission becouse of personal reasons
- o
' harra
, han
' s brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tradgic death of lee
' s sister yeras ago
. the isl
and is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us
- williams
( played by jim kelly
) is black activist runnung fomr the racist police
,
and his friend roper wants to make money in order to pay gambling debts
. tyhe plot of enter the dragon ws in many ways influenced by james bond
( the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man withthe tjhe golden gun twpo years later
)
. the main hero was faced against a power
- hungry megalomaniac onthe a remote isl
and
, alone agains whole army of bad guys
. on the otehr h
and
, lee ws more believeable hero than bond
; deprived of guns
and super
- tech gadgets
, he had to rely only on his personal skills in order tothe survive
. in tjhe same time
, the plot
,
al
though extremly thin
, alowed him even some internal battles
- vetween yhe natural instinct to avenge his sister
and his own anti
- violent philisophy
. the latter provded soem opportunities to evaluate lee
' s acting skills
and some new elements tothe his impressive screen presense
.
al
though two other main actors
- john saxon being tje obligatory good white guy
and jim kelly being the obligatory balck good guy
- were intended to share top spot witht lee
, tehy served as nothing more than a comic relief
. it is a real shame to see kelly
, definitely the worse atcor thna saxon
, to steal the scenes from him only because his lines
, being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches
, sound so damn over thge top
. other actors
, not including shih kien who turns han into typical
,
al
though not very convincing bondian villain
, are nothing more than fist fodder for bruce lee
( among them is young jackie chan
)
. fighting scenes are still impressive today as they were 25 years ago
,
al
though they mostly lack gore associated wtih that genre
. in many way tehy are also more realistic
( they weere personally staged by lee hismelf
)
, dem
anding only a blow or two to incapacitate or kill the opponent
. i
' m not a martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan
,
but comparing thsoe scenes with typical scenes todya i simply can
' t avoid to apprieciate the difference from today
' s movie fights whn masses of bloody pulp manage tothe get up from the floor
and win in the end
. so
, despite all the obvious flaws that preclude htis movie of bieng top 100 ofthe all times
, enter the dragon isnt a incredibly entertaining piece of cinema
and tghe martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who don
' t like that particular genre
.
