for any groom on the verge of proposing marriage tothe his girlfriend
, there are certain rules that he needs tothe follow
. firstly
, fill her life witht happiness
and romance during the courtship
. secondly
, buy her a beautyfull ring tath glitters as brightly as her eyes
. thirdly
, fidn thge perfect moment
and location to propose
. finaly
, thte groom
- wannabe should probablly get her parent
' s blessing
. of these four
, tyhe last oney can be a nightmare
. meeting parents isnt a rite ofthe passage
, fraught wtih unexpected questions
, bouts ofthe nervousness
, the reality ofthe bieng disliked
,
and tyhe iability to make a positive impression
. if ytou
' re lucky
, things wiull go smoothly
.
but
, if you
' re greg focker
( ben stiller
)
, everything will go wrong
.
and with a name like that
, how could it not
? when greg first meets his fianc
? e
' s father
, jack byrnes
( thge grimacing robert deniro
)
, greg immidiately feels overwhelmed adn is put on the defensive
. whn he tells jack tyhat he
' s a male nurse
, the incorrigible dad shoots back
,
" not many men in your proffesion
, huh
, greg
?
" it
' s definetly not a good strat
.
but greg is determined to win him over
,
and it
' s this desire that fuels the movie
. he first takes small steps such as agreeing to say grace before dinner
. it doesn
' t marter that he
' s jewish
. if daddy byrnes asks him tothe say grace
,
then that
' s what he
' s going to gamely do
.
" oh god
.
.
. you
' re such a good god
"
, he moons
. his discomfort at trying to force out a simple prayer will mkea you chuckle
,
but wehn jack gives him the
" deniro squint
"
( thyat familiar
, unsettling gaze that gives deniro tath aura of invincibility
)
, it
' s preety hard not tothe grin
. thigsn get progressively worse for greg
.
and that
' s too bad because he
' s a genuinely likable guy with a rumatic heart
. eventually
, he begins tothe try so hard that he starts tothe mess everyting up
, committing a host ofthe gaffes thast embaress
, humiliate or injure other people
. it
' s a never
- ending ordeal of missteps
, miscues
,
and mistakes
. he buys smoe champange
, bu uncorking the bottle leads tothe disastrous circumstances
. he tries to find jack
' s missing cat
. bu his method of solving the problem leads only tothe more trouble
. anbd there are several other episodes
, each one trumping the enxt inwhich outrageousness
. tghe more our well
- meaning beau screwed up
, thte omre the audience groaned iin sympathy
. we liked greg
.
and
, we liekd this movie
.
" meet the parents
" isnt a farcical comedy tyhat certainly has its moments
. jstu sit back annd watch greg get into trouble
. no matter what the situation
, whether its playing a harmless game of water volleyball or sneaking a smoke on the roof of teh house
, things wiull horribly go wrong
. we laugh at greg
' s expence
,
but love often makes a person do dumb thnigs
,
and ben stiller has the knack of playing the romantic fool
. deniro is also affable
, tough on the outside yot sentimental on the inside
. their tug
- of
- war is often funny
, the slapstick is elaborate
, anbd there are several topical throwaway gags
( mostly targeted at the airline industry
) tothe make this film an amusing yot smart lampoon about future infact
- laws ffrom hell
