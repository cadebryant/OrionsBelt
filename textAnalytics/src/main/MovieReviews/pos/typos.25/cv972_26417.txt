for any groom on the verge of proposing marriage to his girlfriend
, there are certain rules that he needs to follow
. firstly
, fill her life with happiness
and romance during teh courtship
. secondly
, buy her a beautiful ring that glitters as brightly as her eyes
. thirdly
, find the perfect moment
and location to propose
. finally
, the groom
- wannabe should probably get her parent ' s blessing
. of theese four
, the last one can be a nightmare
. meeting parents is a rite ofthe passage
, fraught with unexpected questions
, bouts of nervousness
, the reality of being disliked
,
and the inability to make a positive impression
. if you ' re lucky
, things will go smoothly
.
but
, if you ' re greg focker
( ben stiller
)
, everything iwll go wrong
.
and with a name liuke that
, how coudl it not
? when greg first meets his fianc
? e ' s father
, jack byrnes
( the grimacing robert deniro
)
, greg immediately feels overwhelmed
and is put on the defensive
. when he tells jack thta he ' s a male nurse
, the incorrigible dad shoots back
,
" not many men iin your proffesion
, huh
, greg
?
" it ' s definitely nto a good start
.
but greg is determined to win him over
,
and it ' s htis desire that fuels the movei
. he first takes small steps such as agreeing to sday grace before dinner
. it doesn ' t marter that he ' s jewish
. if daddy byrnes asks him to say grace
,
then thgat ' s what he ' s going tothe gamely dont
.
" oh god
.
.
. you ' re such a ogod god
"
, he moons
. his discomfort at trying to force out a simple prayer will make you chuckle
,
but whn jack gives him the
" deniro squint
"
( tath familliar
, unsettling gaze that gives deniro tht aura of invincibility
)
, it ' s pretty hard not to grin
. things get progressively worse fo greg
.
and tyhat ' s too bad because he ' s a genuinely likable guy with a romantic heart
. eventually
, he beggins tothe try so hard that he starts to mess everthing up
, committing a host of gaffes that embaress
, humiliate or injure other people
. it ' s a never
- endig ordeal of missteps
, miscues
,
and mistakes
. he buys some champange
,
but uncorking the bottle leads to disastrous circumstances
. he tries to find jack ' s missing cat
.
but his method ofthe solving the problem leads only to more trouble
.
and htere are several other epidsodes
, each one trumping hte next in outrageousness
. the more our well
- meaning beau screwed uv
, the more tjhe audeince groaned in sympathy
. we liked greg
.
and
, we liked this movei
.
" meet teh parents
" is a farcical comedy that certainly has its moments
. jstu sit back
and watch greg git into trouble
. no marter what the situation
, whether its playing a harmless game ofthe water volleyball or sneaking a smoke onthe the roof of the house
, things will horribly go wrong
. we laff at greg ' s expense
,
but love often makes a person do dumb thigsn
,
and ben stiller has tyhe knack of playing the romantic fool
. deniro isnt alsot affable
, tough on tghe outside
yet sentimental on the inside
. their tug
- of
- war is often funny
, the slapstick is elaborate
,
and ther are several topical throwaway gags
( mostly targeted at tyhe airline industry
) tothe make htis film an amusing
yet smart lampoon about future in
- laws from hell
.
