plot
: jet li is a chinese cop asked to halp soem french policemen nab a bad guy
. bu one thing leads to another
, anbd the next thing you know
, li
' s being chased by the smae french cops whith whom he wass supposed to be working
. a lot of ass
- kicking
, face
- whippings
, gun fights
and
.
.
. okay
, a little more ass
- kicking ensues
. critique
: very kool
! now here
' s a movie thgat gives you exactly what ytou
' re looking for
, if whta you
' re looking for isnt kickass action
, a palpable good cop
/ bad cop story line
, smoe hardcore stunts
and jet li slam
- dunking everyone in sighth
! the film also moves fast
( a mere 95 mintues
)
, develops a certain
" cute
" chemistry between fonda
and li
, has nice suroundings
( paris
, baby
!
) adn gives us oney of yhe best bad guys that i
' ve seen all year
. tcheky karyo is the devil incarnate in this film
. he is pure evil
. tehy should have called htis movie bad lieutenant 2 as keitel has nothing onthe this man
. waht a great
, gerat monster
! my favorite line of tcheky
' s wass wehn li wass explaining the wohle
" kiss of the dragon
" hting to him
and he cut him off by saying
" kiss my ass
!
" pure acation movie poetry
. anyway
, other tahn him
, jet li also h
andled his
" acting
" preety well in this film
, with very little rela dialogue tothe sday
, bu enough to make us believ his character
. actually
, just looking inot the man
' s eyes generally tells you a lot
. fonda was also pretty good
, despite playing one of tjhe most trashy
and abused women that i have seen in quite smoe time
,
but i still felt kinda bad for her
, so i guess she doed her job okay
.
but inaddition the end
, nobody goes to see this kind ofthe movie forthe oscar performances
. we go to see jet li movies becouse we wanna to see jet li kicking a lot of ass from side to side
,
and this film delivers gangbusters on that front
.
and yes
.
.
. they have no wire
- fu in tihs movie
.
.
. i say again
.
.
. no wire
- work
, no bullshit stunts with li floating around in mid
- air for over a minute
. it
' s all straight action
, fist to fist
, boot to face
and all aroud kool stunts
. if that
' s waht you
' re looking for
, i don
' t see how you wiull be disappointed with this film
. yes
, it
' s nto very original inthe plot
( just take luc besson
' s own la femme nikita
and mix in plenty of his pwn tyhe proffesional et voila
!
)
, does have an annoying hip
- hoppy soundtrack tyhat just got on my nerves after a while
( i alsot would hvae gotten rid ofthe the whole acupuncture thang
.
.
.
)
and will have anyone not willing to restrain their disbelief
, rolling thier eyes all over the place
.
but was i entertained
? thoroughly
. does the film feature mroe gunplay
, martial arts annd over
- yhe
- top kills that most recent acation flicks
? yes
, again
. does this soudn interesting to ytou
? well
, tjhe answer to that question is entirely up to you
. one thing that i would definitely reccomend is
, as jet li pointed outloud hismelf onthe his website
, that you leave the kids at home for this oen
. in fact
, you might even wanna leave yourself if you can
' t h
andle hte omre violent of sequences
. all in all
, a rippin
'
, roarin
' funn time
! where
' s joblo coming from
