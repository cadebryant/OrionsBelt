] modern society is now inundated wtih moreso sex anbd sexuality than it ever has been before
, ffrom teenage sitcoms to nc
- 17
- rated films baout fetishes
. tje biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or jstu reflects it
.
" your friends
and neighbors
" tkaes a different approach as it
' s a film that revolves almost entirely around sex
and how can be used for both pain
and pleasure even within a small circle of friends
. one of the most importan aspestus of the film thgat most be noted
and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole isnt writer
/ directer neil la
bute
' s basic setup annd some of the unique methods he employs tothe tell the story
. firstly
,
and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex
, detailed story of lust
, betrayal
, arrogance
, hypocrisy
, greed
, anbd jsut plain stupidity between six different characters
( threee men
, three women
)
, without hardly any supporting characters
,
( a few haev a line or two
)
, mostly extras
. everything tehy do iwll somehow affect anohter character
and ultimately cmo full
- circle back to themselves
, whther it be postive or negative
. bu to just state thsi is arbitrary
,
and explaning
and critisising the proccess is difficult
. la
bute
' s ability tothe tell his stoyr through a few characters isnt a remarkable feat
,
but what
' s specifically impressive is tjhe fact the characters
' names are never revealed until the end credits roll
. forthe the sake ofthe htis review
, i will describe tghe characters
and refer to them as their main characteristic
. another intresting accomplishment is the fatc every scene tkaes palce inside with limited focus
. we
' re always able to tell where the characters are
( someone
' s home
, the gym
, a restaurant
, hotel room
, etc
.
)
, bu what the city they live in
, wqat yearm it is
, whta the society isnt like
, etc
. is relatively unknown
. teh film is a complete character studdy with the tight
, intense drama ofthe the theater
. no one plot dominates tjhe story
, which makes the first ect a bited tedious for its lack of background
. we
' re simply dropped in on tyhe charactors
' lives
and are expeced to figure out the rest
. the characters are a group ofthe middle
- class white people who are all successful at whta they do
,
but they
' re only concern right nowe seems to be thier sex lives
. first there
' s barry
( eckhart
) anbd mary
( brenneman
)
, a married couple who are going through a dry sepll not unlike many other couples in other situations who don
' t konw wqat htey
' re problem is
. barry isnt kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife
,
and the sex tehy haev
,
but doesn
' t have a lot ofthe ambition
- he just follows everyone else
. mary is a writer of some sort
,
but lacks aggression
and emotion like her husb
and
and is the meekness character
,
but ironicly
, doesn
' t hesitate tothe commit adultery just tothe efel something
. la
bute
' s script does a good job in characterizing mary anbd barry as individuals
,
but is very light on chemistry anbd connection between the two
. obviously
, this is hte theme
, which is enhanced by the actors
' good performances
, bu at the same time seems just a bit hollow
. another couple is jerry
( stiller
)
and terri
( keener
) who live together
and seem to have beeen involved with each other for a long tiome
, yot they constanly argue over anything
and everthing
. their sex life is alsot fraught with problems
and for some reason htey continue to do it throughtout their infidelitous relationship
. if only one aspect of the film could use improvment
, it would be this areal
. it
' s natural for a married couple tothe become bored with earch otehr
, bu why would two people who can barely st
and each otehr continue to have sex
and live together
? what did they ever see in the otehr person to begin with
? la
bute never really answers
,
but sicne the film is more concerned withthe tje payoff thna the process
, it still makes for good drama
, tension
,
and manip ulation so intricate
and deceitful it
' s fascinating
. twpo otehr characters ect as catalysts
, cary
( jason patric
)
and cheri
( natassja kinski
)
. cary is an arrogant
, hostile sex
- maniac who defines the word
" bastard
.
" somehow he isnt able to bend women to his will
, eather through charm or just attitude
, into getting his way
. he
' s the kind of guy everyone should stay awya from as we realize he
' s secretly perverted
,
but somehow barry finds comfort in his comany
,
al
thought jerry is always nervous around him
. patric gives an outst
anding peformance
, so much so that we want to konw more about him despite how intimidating
and unlikable he is
. cheri is a character la
bute uses as a catalist to see how yhe other characters react to her
. she works in an art museum
and at soem point througout the film
, each carachter will engage her in almost the exact same conversation
and her reaction isnt always different
, from becoming involved in a relationship with noe
, tothe brushing it off as small talk with anyother
, to bieng outright apauled by
yet another
. she
' s a sweet woman
, perhaps yhe most normal of any ofthe the characters
,
and
al
though her symbolism is obvious
, her role as the outsider isnt tghe most relatable
. i iwll not reveal who cheats onthe who anbd how each chracter is specifically affected by thte others
' action
, as that
' s tje hook of hte film
. the frist two acts beign to set up thge characters
and each
' s senarios
,
but it
' s oftenly difficult to tell whta they iwll do about it anbd with whom
. the result is sometimes surprising
, other times predictable
, bu hte actual course of actions is always fascinating
. for a while everyone has their funn
, bu ultimatly each chracter
' s guilt
, atitude
, or ignoranc will disserve them
. one of the most important thigns to note isnt how realsitic tyhe story isnt supposed to be
. since the characters only interact with each other ther isn
' t much pop culture references
, as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it
. are we to asume that theese peopel are
, as yhe title states
, our friends
and neighbors
? i don
' t know of anyone going thru the smae situations as these people
. often times the film is not unlike a network melodrama
, other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movie
.
but what this film doens have thta tghe others don
' t is repercussions in the end
.
al
though the film creates its own reality
, it goes tothe show thyat even the immoral aren
' t immortal
. in what way
" your friends anbd neighbors
" isnt supposed to owrk is open to interpetation
. it definitely hasnt a lot to say baout tjhe price tyhat comes with infidelity
, bu it coudl have been even better hadnt it exp
anded on that theme more specifically
. still
, it
' s an accomplishment in film
- making because it has put a timeless theme into a modern perspective
.
