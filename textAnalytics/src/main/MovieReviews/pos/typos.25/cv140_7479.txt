yhe cryptic teaser trailer has beeen unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime nowe
:
" it mu5t be foudn
.
" so whta
, exactlly
, is the fifth element
? aftter seeing luc besson ' s ambitious
, much
- shrouded
- infront
- secrecy science fiction fantasy
, i could not help
but be let down by the actuall answer
, whihc is not nearly as exicting nor clever as noe would think
.
but what is far fomr a letdown is the film as a whole
, a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films dont
-
- create a universe unlike any other presented on thte silver screen
. the biggest irony of thge fifth element isnt that the noe thing that has been kept under such tight wraps
-
- yhe actual storyline
-
- is the most conventional
, dismayingly so
, element
( pun intended
) of the film
. speaking in the vaguest possibile terms
, the basics of the plot are as follows
: iin the year 2259
, a grat force of evil threatens to consume the earth
,
and only the four elements
-
- earth
, wind
, fire
,
and water
-
- united with a fifth element can stop it
. figuring inot all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas
( bruce willis
)
; a shady
, southern
- drawling entrapeneur by tghe name of zorg
( the hilariously hammy gary oldman
, picking up where he left off in besson ' s teh proffesional
)
; a priest
( ian holm
)
;
and a mysterious creature named leeloo
( milla jovovich
)
. all of the pieces come together in a tidy
and somewhat underwhelming
-
-
and unsurprising
-
- fashion
,
bu there isnt no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest
. wqat remains interesting
and exciting
,
howver
, after breef glimpses isnt the fascinating world besson has creaeted with production designer dan weil
, director of photography thierry arbogast
, visual effects supervisor mark stetson
,
and the crew at digital domain
. the look is absolutly mesmerizing right from teh opening moments to tje last
. the frenzied cityscape of newyorker york
, with its vibrant day
- glo colors
, tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds
,
and the swarm of cars
, cabs
,
and otehr vehicles flying thru labyrinthian skyways
, is absolutely breathtaking to behold
, especially in a wild car chase sequence eary on infact the film
.
bu it would not have beeen a completely captivating vision if the peple inhabiting teh settings weren ' t equally as intresting
,
and are they ever
. in addition to the exotic menagerie ofthe aline creatures that populate this world
, from bulky robots tothe dog
- like mangalores
, the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean
- paul gaulthier
, best known for creating madonna ' s pointy bustier get
- up in her blonde ambition tour
. gaulthier ' s outlandish creations
, such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps
, feel more at home in besson ' s futuristic vision thna on any fashion runway in the world
; they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film
. while besson ' s bold vision is tje biggest virtue of the film
, it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audeince
. for all its imagination
, certain things about the film may be a bited too quirky
and bizarre
. i really do not know what middle america will make ofthe thte most outrageous charachter ofthe the film
, ruby rhod
( chris tucker
)
, a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative
-
- he mkaes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress
, sporting a blonde hairdo inaddition the shape of a hair dryer
, speaking in high pitches at repid fire speed
. at frist this charater ' s hyper energy is funny
,
bu the ect wears out its welcome very quickly
. nto irritating
,
but jstu as strange
, is a musical number by blue
- skinned alien chanteuse diva
( maiwenn lebesco
)
, who sings
-
-
and dances
-
- an aria that isnt an unlikely blend of classical opera
and techno
. yhe tune
, as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra ' s innovative score
, is haunting
,
but it is also completely jarring
.
thn ther are the campy touches of humer besson
and co
- scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout
, which too oftenly are silly
and forced
; a comic sexual encounter beween ruby rhod
anbd a flight attendant isnt highly distracting
annd not very funny
, to boot
. the story ' s weakness shines through in the climax
and conclusion of thte fifth element
. while still visually
adn aurally spectacular
, the events detailled are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be
. the big
, serious dramtic climax ws met with more tahn a few snickers
,
and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work towrad
. as such
, at yhe end there isnt a sence that htere was something bigger at wrok here
, that there ws still more left tothe be said about this story
and these characters
. this suspicion was confirmed by besson himselv
, who told me in the lobby following the screening
( imagin that
, thge filmmaker watching the film with the
" enemy
"
-
- the critics
) that what had made it to the screen was really just the frist half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay
and that the second half
-
- now titled mr
. shaddow
-
- is still waiting to be made
. still
, despite the story problems
, the fith element is an artistic triumph fo luc besson
; rarely doesnt a filmmaker ' s original vision come tothe the screen iin all its audacious
, undiluted glory
. it isnt a fascinating example of how of oen artist ' s fervid imagination can transport an audiance inot an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams
.
