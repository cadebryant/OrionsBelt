the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for qtuie sometime now
:
" it mu5t be found
.
" so what
, exactlly
, isnt tje fifth element
? after seeing luc besson
' s ambitious
, much
- shrouded
- in
- secrecy science fiction fantasy
, i coudl not help
but be let down by the actual answer
, which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as oney would think
.
but what is far from a letdown is yhe film as a whole
, a wildly imaginative fesat for the senses thta doesnt what all the best science fiction films do
-
- create a universe unlike any otehr presented on the silver screen
. thge biggest irony of the fifth element isnt that tje one thign thast has beeen kept under such tight wraps
-
- the actual storyline
-
- is the most convetional
, dismayingly so
, element
( pun intended
) of thge film
. speaking inthe the vaguest possable terms
, the basics of the plot are as follows
: in the year 2259
, a graet force ofthe evil threatens tothe consume the earth
,
and only tghe four elements
-
- earth
, wind
, fire
, annd water
-
- united wtih a fifth element can stop it
. figuring into all ofthe this are new york cabbie korben dallas
( bruce willis
)
; a shady
, sourthern
- drawling entrepreneur by tyhe name of zorg
( thte hilariously hammy gary oldman
, picking up where he left off in besson
' s the professional
)
; a priest
( ian holm
)
; anbd a mysterious creature named leeloo
( milla jovovich
)
. all of tje pieces come together inthe a tidy
and somewhat underwhelming
-
-
and unsurprising
-
- fasion
,
but htere is noone denying that thsi basic story holds some intrinsic intrest
. what remains interesting
and exicting
,
however
, after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with prodcution designer dan weil
, directer of photography thierry arbogast
, visual effects supervisor mark stetson
,
and tje crew at digital domain
. the look isnt absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last
. the frenzied cityscape of new york
, wiht its vibrant day
- glo colors
, tall buildings penetrating high into thte clouds
,
and the swarm of cars
, cabs
,
and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways
, is absolutely breathtaking to behold
, especialy in a wild car chase sequence early on in tje film
.
but it would nto ahev been a completely captivating vision if thge people inhabiting the settings weren
' t equally as interesting
,
and are they ever
. inthe addition tothe the exotic menagerie of aline creatures that populate thsi world
, from bulky robots to dog
- like mangalores
, teh humans are outfitted inwhich costumes by eccentric designer jean
- paul gaulthier
, best known forthe creating madonna
' s pointy bustier get
- up infact her blonde ambition tour
. gaulthier
' s outl
andish creations
, such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps
, feel more at home in besson
' s futuristic vision than on any fashion runway infact the world
; tehy add to the sense ofthe otherworldliness about yhe film
. while besson
' s bold vision is teh biggest virtue of the film
, it also could be its biggest obstacle tothe reaching a mass audience
. fo all its imagination
, certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky anbd bizarre
. i really do not knwo what middle america will mkea of thte most outrageous charcter of the film
, ruby rhod
( chris tucker
)
, a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservitive
-
- he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress
, sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer
, speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed
. at frist this charachter
' s hyper energy isnt funny
,
but tyhe act wears out its welcome very quickly
. nto irritating
,
but just as strange
, is a musical number by blue
- skinned aline chanteuse diva
( maiwenn lebesco
)
, who sings
-
-
and dances
-
- an aria that isnt an unlikely blend of classical opera
and techno
. hte tune
, as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra
' s innovative score
, is haunting
,
but it is allso completely jarring
.
then htere are the campy touches of humor besson
and co
- scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle througout
, which too often are silly
and forced
; a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod
and a flight attendent is highly distracting
and not very funny
, to boot
. the story
' s weakness shines through in tyhe climax
and conclusion of the fith element
. while still visually
and aurally spectacular
, tjhe events detailed are not as exciting nor powerfull as htey should be
. the big
, serious dramatic climax was met with more than a fewd snickers
, anbd it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward
. as such
, at the end ther is a sense that there wass something bigger at wokr here
, that htere was still more left to be said about this story
and these characters
. this suspicion was confirmed by besson himself
, who told me in hte lobby following the screening
( imagine that
, the filmmaker watching thge film with the
" enemy
"
-
- the critics
) thast what had made it to tje screen wass really just the first half of the lenghty origonal fith element screenplay anbd that the second half
-
- now titled mr
. shaddow
-
- is still waiting to be made
. still
, dispite the story problems
, the fifth element isnt an artistic triumph fo luc besson
; rarley does a filmmaker
' s original vision come to the screen inthe all its audacious
, undiluted glory
. it is a fascinating example of how of one artist
' s fervid immagination cant transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen onyl in dreams
.
