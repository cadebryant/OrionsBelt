( borrowed from chris wessell
)
. when it comes to modern gangster movies
, it
' s really difficult tothe describe annd review them without makeing comparisons tothe other films of the genre
and
/ or just useing tghe word
" routine
.
" i
' ve always subscribed to the philosophy tyhat any idea
( no marter how many times it
' s been used before
) cant provide for a good story
and
" donnie brasco
" clinches thsi diea
. it
' s not unlike most of the great films of the genre
,
yet it never apes another
' s style as it hasnt a good layer of au
thenticity
, even if its core is a tad stale
. tyhe film starts off in typical fasion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s
and the mobsters who inhibit it
. we meet lefty
( pacino
)
, an aging wiseguy who cxan still walk the walk annd talk the talk
. he
and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this
. somehow he comes across donnie brasco
( depp
)
, a yuonger guy with a lot of spunk who isn
' t afriad of lefty
and his rep
, adn even manages to befriend him after lefty wass ready tothe kill him
. it
' s clear donnie isnt newyorker to the life
and lefty recognizes this immediately
, telling him all the tricks ofthe teh trade
. i have never seen htis technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before
and for this tghe film deserves credit
.
however
, we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone
, an fbi agent wokring undercover
- a character who symbolizes teh viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle
and treated as a newcomer
. the first act works as a guided to ot ofthe rhetoric about wiseguy hounour
, a brief history ofthe the mob
, definitions of their slang
,
and where thier money comes from anbd who it goes to
. thte screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements
, howver
, the fact htey are mentioned at all isnt quite original
. most gangster movies seem tothe be made with the notion the viewer already konws how the mob works
( probably from watching other gangster movies
)
, adn
al
though this attitude comes across
, the film tries to fill in all the holes where
and whn it can
and tyhe effort isnt appreciable
. thankfully the film doesn
' t become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime
, adn instead opts for character development
. much of the story is told simply through tyhe interaction betwen lefty anbd donnie
. pacino is outst
anding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job inaddition the same manner any blue collar worker would
. he
' s old
and exhausted
but seems to enjoy what he doesnt
, jsut as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be
. we learn of his acomplishments
, which are quite impressive withing their context
,
and when he complains baout nto being made top boss
, it
' s easy tothe sympathize with him
. newell constanly plays up this aspect
, making it a major theme which works well in the long run
. as donnie is constantly impressing
and even one
- upping lefty
, it
' s hard to tell which emotion is more powerfull
: tyhe fact donnie is getting closer to nailing tje mob
; or teh fatc lefty has once again been over shadowed
. most of the film tells yhe story of donnie
' s life in mafia
, which creates fo many sub
- plots
and individule conflicts
,
but doesn
' t always seem to come together as a whole
. the storytelling is genuinely intresting throughout
, even when tjhe motions the characters go thru seem familiar
. the resonance to donnie
' s actual assignment varies
, he often reports back to the feds with detail ofthe his progress
,
but it doesn
' t always seem to hvea much meaning
. back home
, his wife maggie
( heche
) is ready tothe divorce him because he
' s never a
and hte family is sufferring
. sicne this is based on a true story i wouldn
' t doubt this owudl happen
,
al
though the way it isnt h
andled often borders onthe the melodramatic
. my only major complaint isnt thte film seems to have no fianl act
, or at least any rela sense of closure
. a climax of sorts does occur
,
but ther
' s little feeling ofthe a payoff
. we git a happy endig
, which isnt good
,
but prehaps a sad ending would have been more powerful
. asside from a few minor
, general flaws
,
" donnie brasco
" manages to be a solid piece of storytelling annd character development
. it may be routine
,
but it
' s good
,
and that
' s respectful
.
