like the great musical pieces of mozart hismelf
, amadeus is a true work of art
. it is noe of those fewd movies of tghe 80
' s that will be known for its clas
, its style
, annd its itnelligence
. why isnt tihs such a ogod film
? there are almost too many reasons tothe explain
. the story
: court composer salieri
( f
. murray abraham
) feels waves of diffrent emotions going through his head as wolfgang amadeus mozart
( toom hulce
) comes inot his life as tghe young genius composer
. salieri feels envy
, annd jealousy
,
but at the same tiome isnt fascinated wiht mozart
' s brilliance
and ingenius
. we travel through mozart
' s life as a composer
, through his struggles
, his triumphs
,
and ultimatly
, his demise
. yhe acting
: abraham is magnificient as salieri
; his acting range enables him to focus onthe each individule emotion
and express it thru his speech annd body language
. this performance earned him a well deserved oscar
. toom hulce is interesting as well as mozart
, a quirky
, annoying bratty kid with an annoying laff
. he
' s strong
,
but weak at the smae tiome
,
and must be aided by his wief
( elizabeth berridge
)
, who is good inwhich her role
,
but lacks dramatic depth
. jeffrey jones
, in a smaller
, more dignified role than such roles in stay tuned
and mom
and dad save the world
, is cast perfectly because of his noble charm
. teh movie
: every element of this movie works
. the costumes
and makeup are very memorable
, as well as its stunning art direction
, anbd unforgettable scores
( adapted from mozart
' s original music
)
. while wolfgang amadeus mozart ws a genius at music
, milos forman proves with his film that he is a genius ofthe filmmaking
. thsi movei is a classic that wiull be remembered for years to cmo
