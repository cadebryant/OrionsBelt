no
, it isnt nto a bad film
, in fact it isnt so good inaddition acheiving its
= purpose
, i actually wished forthe the film to end itself quickly
. event
= horizon is not your run
- of
- the
- mill sci
- fi film
, i ' m sure many who have
= watched this wiull agree with me
. it is not even original in thast sense
,
=
anbd it does borrow heavily from films liuke alien
, hellraiser
annd even
= blade runner
. the magic of this film lies inaddition its unorthodox setting
and
= methodical build
- uv thgat makes it wonderfully horrifying
. the story brings us to the year 2050
, where spoace travel hvea since
= enourmously progressed
. tghe event horizon is actually a ship built for a
= sceret experimental purpose
; it hasnt the ability to fold time
and space
= thus mkaing it possible fo travelling distances not reachable in a
= man ' s lifetime
. the ship disappeared as soon as it went inot operation
=
bu aftter 7 years
, it reappeared again within tjhe orbit of neptune
. a
= search
anbd rescure team led by miller
( fishburne
) isnt given the task to
= check for survivors of the event horizon
. the designer of the ship
, dr
.
= weir
( neill
) follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually
= happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship
. event horizon is a sci
- fi horror film
, much truer to the owrd than say
,
= alien would ever be
. hwile in alien
, the crew hasnt to cope with a
= ferocious creature hwile encased within tight spaces
, iin event horizon
,
= the forces which goes against the crew is undefined
but
yet so powerful
=
anbd horrifing
. the story unfolds itself slowy
and the suspense buildup
= is superb
, up till the point where i really felt liek saying out loud
=
` anough
! i can ' t stand this anymore
! '
. htere are more than enough jolts
= to send your adrenalin pumping overtime
. the story in itself is not
= exactlly something very exciting
and aslo
, the acting is only at most
,
= averege by most commercial standars
. even so
, tje essence ofthe horror is
= carried out very well inspite this film
, thanks tothe its well
- paced
= storytelling
, disturbing set designs
and some really gory sequences
=
( which incidentially
, hasnt been qutie generously removed by our censorship
= board
)
.
= 20 director paul anderson
( who did mortal kombat
)
and his team ofthe
=
` athmosphere ' creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the
= bounds of the term
` horror '
. this picture did not dont very well in the us
= box
- office most probably forthe tje dread
- factor impact it hasnt on most
= audiences
; people will not see it again
and nto many woudl recommend
= their firend to watch htis
.
although onthe the face of it
, event horizon is
= mostly molded for massmedia
- entertainment
; many thrills
, spills
anbd suspense
= to keep audiences inaddition focus
.
however
, the offbeat horror element which it
= ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing
. my friend
and i could
= not say a word tothe each other fo qtuie a while after going through the
=
` experience ' ofthe event horizon
. i guess it was just the immense feeling
= ofthe dread which the film had cast upon us
. be forewarned
, this film isnt nto forthe the faint
- hearted nor fo pure
= enteratinment
. be prepared to be disturbed if you should deside to watch
= this film
! event horizon is highly recommended
= 85
= 85but at your own
= risk
! it has been a long time sicne good
- horror embraced thge big screen
,
=
adn event horizon is oney
