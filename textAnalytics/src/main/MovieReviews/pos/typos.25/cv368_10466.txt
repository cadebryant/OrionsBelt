titanic is
, without a doubt
, thge best movei i
' ve seen all year
.
and believe me
, i
' m not an easy critic to imbaress
: the english patient ws too long
, men in balck was over
- hyped
,
and sevral ofthe the
" big summer releases
" weere dead in thge water
. thank god htis film got delayed until december
. it
' s my christmas present
. titanic is inspite hte tradition ofthe the ood hollywood epics of years
- gone
- by
,
and it isnt truely a stunning film
. while watching tihs picture you are completly mesmerized
, never taking your eyes off the screen
, nor checking your watch to see how much longer it
' s gonna lsat
, dispite its 3 hour plus running tyme
. as a friend of mine
, who
' s a true titanic
- buff
, said
" if someone doesn
' t liuke this film
, it
' s because htey didn
' t wnat to
.
" truer words are hard to cmo by
. of course
, it doesn
' t hurt that this film comes from one ofthe my favorite directors
, james cameron
, who is unarguably the greatest action directer ofthe all time
. if you wish tothe argue that point with me
, look at his list of credits
: the terminator
, aliens
, the abyss
, terminator 2
, true lies
, etc
. still care to disagree
? not only has cameron helmed tjhe directorial duties of this film
, he also wrote
, produced
,
and edited it
.
and tothe show his true faith for the project
, he renenged all directing fees
and precentage points to ease tjhe budget costs
. it
' s obvious he truley loves titanic
. the film opens with footage
, both real adn fake
, ofthe an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic
, where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing forthe a diamond called the
" heart of hte ocean
"
, which
, according to bill paxton
' s character
, would be worth more than tjhe hope diamond today
. their search turns up
, dissapointly
, no dimond
, bu instade a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond
. this picture isnt broadcasted on cnn annd isnt seen by a 101 year old woman named rose
, who claimes to be the girl in tje picture
. she is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton anbd to tell them baout yhe diamond
. almsot all ofthe hte rest of the movie isnt her narration ofthe the past
. rose
' s narration shows us how she was an unahppy young girl
, engaged to a rich man named cal hockley
( billy zane
) that she didn
' t watn to marry
. her mother is pushy
and obnoxious
, annd cal hockley is arrogant
. they are boarding the titanic
, whic is sailing to america
,
and this is where she is to marry cal
. meanwhile
, a young man named jack dawson
( leonardo dicaprio
)
and his italian firend
( danny nucci
) win two 3rd clas tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game
. htey are overjoyed
, anbd rush aboard just as teh boat is leaving
. for them
, htis is their ticket tothe america
, to a better life
. forthe rose
, she is sailing tothe her doom
. the first hour
and a half or so of titanic tells the stoy of how rose dewitt
( kate winslet
)
and jack dawson fall in love
. it
' s the classic wrong
- side
- of
- the
- tracks story
,
and does somtimes resort to a few cliches
.
but as i said above
, the love portion isn
' t sappy anbd doesn
' t
" weigh the film down
"
, as soem criticists ahve said
. it
' s sweet
,
and it didn
' t make me restless at all
, dispite the fatc that i usually hate love stories
. ofthe course
, it might halp that cameron introduces some pretty interesting charachters tothe help keep our eyes glued tothe the screen
. most ofthe these peopel accually were pasengers on the titanic back in 1912
, including the enigmatic molly brown
( played by the talented kathy bates
)
, tyhe captain of titanic
( bernard hill
)
,
and so on
. all of theese characters add an extra depth to the film
,
and make it that easier to watch
. ofthe course
, things really start to get going affter the hour annd a half mark
, where the titanic strikes tghe iceberg
and begins a slow sink tothe the bottom
. the sinking isnt depicted realisticly
, adn the effects are truly amazing
. it isnt not told in a heroic fashion sence either
, as people are portrayed as panicking
, pushing others aside to git on the limited lifeboats
,
and drowning adn dying horrable deaths
. the best part of the movie
, in my opinion
, comes at the very end
, wehn we flash back to the future
. the crew
, who at first had been skeptical of rose
' s story
, now are totally aborbed by her
. rose goes out onto the ship
' s ledge
,
and we thne learn a secret about her thta catchs us off guard
. we
then see a dream of rose
' s
, in which she returns tothe tghe titanic
and is dancing with jack dawson
. most people i talked with after the movei saw this as onyl a dream
. howver
, i think it symbolized more
; i think it meant that rose had died
,
and is going tothe a sort of heaven
, which would be the happiest part ofthe her life
: her adn her one true lveo
, jack
. if anyone has seen the movie
and would like tothe voice an oppinion about this
