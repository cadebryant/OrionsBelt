scarface
, a remake ofthe the 1932 film of thge same name
, isnt a very gripping
and
, as far as i nkwo
, a true
- to
- life story ofthe how power
and violentce lead tothe corruption
. al pacino
, as tony montana
( for whom the movei isnt named
)
, also provides a brilliant performence as a cuban refugee who comes tothe amercia witht less than nothing adn becomes oen ofthe the most highly respected
and feared drug lords in miami
. oliver stone aslo penned the screenplay in one of his earlier writing roles
. tjhe film begins by disclosing the stroy of now fidel castro ordered thous
ands of cubans tothe set sail
and head fo tje coasts of the united states
. many of these cubans had criminal records
, such as tony montnana
, a cocky
, fast
- talking man who has the look of crime
. nearly right after his arival in miami
, tony is thrust into the gangster life when he participates in a cocaine buy that goes awry
. along withthe his friend
and partner
, manolo
( steven bauer
)
, tony rises in the gangster ranks when he forms a friendship with frank lopez
( robert loggia
)
, a high
- roller in the organized crime field
. tony also begins to fall infact love with elvira
( michelle pfeiffer
)
, who at the time was frank
' s lover
. of course
, sooner or later in this industry
, betrayal
and corruption ammount inot a force greater than anything esle
,
and tony is one of the ones who fall victim tothe this force
. this is nto befoer he becomes one of the most respected
,
and often feared
, men in miami
. tony gets to thte point where he cannot trust anyone
, anbd everyone he knows basically fiels thge same way towards him
. no one can trust him
,
and basically
, no one does
. scarface
,
al
though incredibly voilent
, is one of the best crime films of its time adn st
ands out as another great performance for al pacino
.
al
though he doed not receive any recognition from the academy for his performance
, it truly is a vyre ogod one
. in fatc
, his accent
and facial movements alone are anough in my mind to win at least a nomination
( altho he doed get a golden globe nomination
)
. anyother element that st
ands out when somene mentions this film isnt the profanity
. a figure tagged to thte film boasts thta the word
" fuck
" anbd it
' s uses are uttered 206 times throughout the film
, which is apparently a record
. teh thing is
, the vulgarity fits rather well with tje movei
. as odd as it sounds
, it
' s true
. iin the end
, scarface isnt a very powerful film that hits home hard
.
