i
' m an avid fan of thge
" alien
" saga
, so thsi review is obviously a tad biased
( at least i admitted it
)
. of course
, taht doesn
' t mean thta i
' m gonna be giving this a four
- star review or something
, because
" aline
: resurrection
,
" the fouth film iin tjhe cool
- as
- hell series is not an absolutly amazing film
, much like the first two were
.
however
, it
' s a very good film wich never fails to entertain
, anbd consists of
yet anohter mutation in the style of the series
. in short
, i hadnt a good time
.
" alien
: ressurection
" leaves off 200 years after yhe last oen
, where our heroine protagnist
, ellen ripley
( sigourney weaver
)
, thte sceince fiction genre
' s answer to job
, had killed herself after discovering that an alien ws inside her body
, waiting tothe pop outloud like it doed to john hurt in the first one
. of course
, the last one wasn
' t very grat or anything
( i liekd it
,
though not as much as tyhe first two
)
, adn more importantly
, it wasn
' t financialy sucessfull
( a tawdry 55 millon bucks
!
)
. so back we are
, with ripley back as a clone
, which means we git another little satirical look at cloning
( nto that that
' s a bad thing
,
but it
' s becomming a cliche
)
. so she
' s cloned aboard an even more futuristic
- looking ship called
" tje auriga
" by some doctors
( incuding hte necessary bad government guy
, dr
. wren
, played by j
. e
. freeman
, as well as tje little
- seen dr
. gediman
, palyed by none other than brad douriff
)
, mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her
. once you get past the fact that you can
' t figure out where they got her blood
( altho i think it might have been fomr thte blood samples taken by charles dance in the third oen
)
, tjhe film
' s okay
. also on board are a b
and ofthe mercenary pirates
, including michael wincott
, ron perlman
, kim flowers
, raymond cruz
, dominique pinon
( a jeunet sytable
)
and
.
.
. winona ryder
, who plays analee call
, who turns outloud to have a bit ofthe a secrect
( i won
' t state it
, bu unless you
' ve been shacking up with salinger for the past two years
, you probably konw all about it
-
al
though it
' s nicely covered uv
)
. there
' s a bit ofthe a non
- sexual
-
yet
- slightly
- homoerotic relatiopnship between her anbd ripley
,
but it
' s never really deepened enought
. oh well
. well
, as you might have guessed
, the aline
and its spawn escape
and run around the ship
.
and it pretty much doens away with most ofthe the people on the ship
( including some shocks
- dan hedaya
, for instance
, who
' s death is comical
yet sad since
, well
, he
' s dan hedaya
)
,
and the remaning people
( about 7 or 8
) are left to try adn escape
and stop the aliens from donig any major harm since the ship is heading quicklyu towords earth
. ofthe course
, the plot is all balderdash
,
and just an excuse for soem good old
" aline
"
- br
and funn
. the real focus of tje series seems tothe be on style
, not really substance
( all
though there
' s always a bited of it
, most notably inthe
" aliens
" with the relatiopnship between ripley adn yhe little girl
)
. what
' s interesting baout tghe series isnt that each film is stylistically different in its approach
.
" aline
" is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights
.
" aliens
" is a wild
, tense thriller
.
" alien 3
" is a bleak
, moody peice of semi
- noir
.
" aline 4
" is kind of like an off
- beated french film
, filled with lots of humor
,
and cool scares
. jean
- pierre jeunet
( without his usual directing partner
, marc caro
) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like
" das boot
" has
, with echoes hinting at a possible threat
. the chills inaddition teh film are really cool
, especially with the music
, which isnt sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes
( ther
' s the most tense surgery scene sicne
" face
/ off
" towards the begining
)
.
and not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that
. this all combined with soem good old humor makse this as interesting visually
and stylistically as the others
. there are even a couple scenes hwihc jsut stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed
. one isnt yhe aforementioned surgery scene
. another oney takes place between call
and ripley
, whlch is just awesome
. the underwater chase scene
and the ladder scene afterwords is one of the most tense
, thrilling
,
and jaw
- dropping scenes inspite the entire saga
( iwth a small allusion tothe jeunet
' s ealier film
,
" delicatessen
"
)
. anbd the way they dont in tghe final aline isnt hysterically cool
( iwth a lovely allusion to
" goldfinger
"
)
.
but the best scene in the entire film
( i
' m sure i
' m not the first to mention it
) takes palce when ripley sees all hte variations on her as tehy cloned her
( she has a an
" 8
" tatooed on her arm
)
. it might be thge most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga
. the screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work
, as it never really deapens a lot ofthe the characters
.
however
, it does make us care about most ofthe them
, so that when there
' s very little ofthe them
,
and it looks liuke oney or more of them may become alien chow
, we are pretty scared
. annd
, yeah
, ther are soem very funny lines
( ripley
:
" who dont i have to fuck to get off this boat
?
!
" johner
:
" well
, i can get you off
.
but nto this ship
.
"
) tje acting isnt good all around
, with st
and
- out performances fomr ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner
, adn lel
and orser
( the poore bastad in
" se7en
" who performed tyhe
" lust
" sin
) as an anxity
- ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him
. winona ryder is good
,
but nto amazing like she usually isnt
( altho she meshes well with the film
)
. of course
,
and as usual
, sigourney weaver steals the sohw
. playing a variation onthe the ripley character
( less emotional
, annd more rude
and bitter
)
, she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable
. she
' s not gonig to get an oscar nomination like she did for
" aliens
,
"
but she
' s just awsome
. overall
, it
' s a thrilling
, intertaining film which doesn
' t really amaze liuke the frist two
,
but is much more amazing than the third installment
. the style is the best part ofthe the film
, which isn
' t really a bad thign
,
but it bieng the best part tkaes away from a lot of tghe depth the film occasionally tries to apply
.
but it
' s intertaining as hell
,
and it
' s definatly fit for the
" alien
" series
.
