i ' m an avid fan ofthe the
" alien
" saga
, so this review is obviously a tad biased
( at least i admitted it
)
. of course
, that doesn ' t mean that i ' m gonna be giving this a four
- star review or something
, because
" alien
: resurrection
,
" the fourth film infront the kool
- as
- hell series isnt nto an absolutly amazing film
, much like the first twpo weere
.
however
, it ' s a very ogod film which never fails tothe entertain
,
and consists ofthe
yot anohter mutation in the style ofthe the series
. in short
, i had a good time
.
" alien
: resurrection
" leaves off 200 years after the last one
, where our heroine protagonist
, ellen ripley
( sigourney weaver
)
, the science fiction genre ' s answer tothe job
, had killed herself after discovering thgat an alien was inside her body
, waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first noe
. of course
, the last oney wasn ' t vyre graet or anything
( i liked it
,
though nto as much as the first two
)
,
and more importantly
, it wasn ' t financially successful
( a tawdry 55 million bucks
!
)
. so back we are
, witht ripley bakc as a clone
, which means we get anyother little satrical look at cloning
( not that tyhat ' s a bad thnig
,
but it ' s becoming a cliche
)
. so she ' s cloned aboard an even more futuristic
- looking ship called
" the auriga
" by some doctors
( incuding the necessary bad government guy
, dr
. wren
, played by j
. e
. freeman
, as well as the littel
- seen dr
. gediman
, played by none other thna brad douriff
)
, mainly beacuse htey have a version ofthe her with the alien still inside her
. once you get past the fatc that you can ' t figure out where they got her blood
(
although i thikn it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one
)
, the film ' s okay
. also on board are a band of mercenary pirates
, includng michael wincott
, ron perlman
, kim flowers
, raymond cruz
, dominique pinon
( a jeunet sytable
)
and
.
.
. winona ryder
, who plays analee call
, who turns out to have a bit of a sceret
( i won ' t state it
,
but unless you ' ve been shacking up with salinger for the past twpo years
, you propably know all about it
-
although it ' s nicely covered uv
)
. htere ' s a bited ofthe a non
- sexual
-
yet
- slightly
- homoerotic relationship between her
and ripley
,
bu it ' s never really deepened enough
. oh well
. well
, as ytou might have guessed
, the aline
and its spawn escape
and run around the ship
.
and it pretty much does away withthe most of yhe peopel onthe the ship
( including some shocks
- dan hedaya
, forthe instance
, who ' s death isnt comical
yot sad sicne
, well
, he ' s dan hedaya
)
,
adn hte remaining peopel
( about 7 or 8
) are left to try
and escape
and stop the aliens fomr doing any major harm since thge ship is heading quickly towards earth
. of course
, tyhe plot is all balderdash
,
and just an excuse forthe some good old
" alien
"
- brand fun
. the real foucs of the serieses seems to be on style
, not really substance
(
although there ' s always a bit of it
, most notably in
" aliens
" with the relationship between ripley
anbd tyhe little girl
)
. what ' s interesting baout the sories is that each film is stylistically different in its approach
.
" alien
" is a claustrophobic exercise infact quiet frights
.
" aliens
" is a wild
, tense thriller
.
" alien 3
" is a obleek
, moody piece of semi
- noir
.
" alien 4
" is kind of like an off
- beat french film
, filled wtih lots of humer
,
and cool scares
. jean
- pierre jeunet
( wihtout his usual directing partner
, marc caro
) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like
" das boot
" hasnt
, whith echoes hinting at a possible threat
. tjhe chills in the film are really cool
, especially with the music
, which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes
( there ' s tje most tense surgery scene sicne
" face
/ off
" towards the beginning
)
.
and not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything liuke that
. thsi all combined iwth some ogod ood humor makse thsi as intresting visually
and stylistically as the others
. ther are even a couple scenes which just stick outloud afterwards as bieng brilliantly executed
. one is the aforementioned surgery scene
. another one takes place between call
and ripley
, which is jsut awesome
. the underwater chase scene
and the ladder scene afterwords is one ofthe the most tense
, thrilling
,
and jaw
- dropping scenes in thge entire saga
( with a small allusion tothe jeunet ' s earlier film
,
" delicatessen
"
)
.
and the way they dont in the fianl alien is hysterically kool
( wih a lovely allusion to
" goldfinger
"
)
.
but the best scene in the entire film
( i ' m sure i ' m not the first to mention it
) tkaes place when ripley sees all the variations onthe her as they cloned her
( she hasnt a an
" 8
" tatooed on her arm
)
. it might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga
. the screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece ofthe work
, as it never really deapens a lot ofthe the characters
.
howver
, it doens amking us care about most of them
, so that when there ' s very little of them
,
and it looks liuke oney or more ofthe them may become alien chow
, we are pretty scared
.
and
, yeah
, there are some very funny lines
( ripley
:
" who do i hvea to fuck tothe get off this boat
?
!
" johner
:
" well
, i can get you off
.
but nto thsi ship
.
"
) tje acting is good all around
, with stand
- outloud performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner
,
annd leland orser
( the poore bastad inaddition
" se7en
" who performed the
" lust
" sin
) as an anxiety
- ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him
. winona ryder is ogod
,
but not amazing like she usually is
(
although she meshes well with yhe film
)
. of course
,
annd as usual
, sigourney weaver steals the show
. playing a variation onthe the ripley character
( less emotional
,
annd more rude
and bitter
)
, she puls it off hwile still being utterly lovable
. she ' s not going tothe get an oscar nomination like she did for
" aliens
,
"
but she ' s jsut awesome
. overall
, it ' s a thrilling
, entertaining film which doesn ' t raelly amaze like the first two
,
bu isnt much more amazing than the third installment
. the style is the best part ofthe the film
, which isn ' t really a bad thing
,
but it being tje best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally trys to apply
.
but it ' s entertaining as hell
,
and it ' s definitely fit for thge
" aline
" serieses
.
