the long
adn illustrious career of robin williams
, hwihc has included both forgettable turns like mrs
. doubtfire
annd flubber
, was punctuated with tjhe actor ' s first academy award in 1998 for his role inthe good will hunting
. it was his first truly dramatic role since 1989 ' s dead poets society
,
anbd critical remarks weere unanimously postive
. his enxt role
, that of a deceased pediatrician in waht dreams may come
, was unfortunately lackluster
.
anbd so
, aftter a six
- yera stint as a comedic actor
, the proof on whether or nto williams can cutted it in teh dramatic leage hasnt come down to patch adams
. williams is the title character
, hunter
" patch
" adams
, sporting scruffy facial hair that falls between the clean
- shavenness of dreams
and the grotesque hairiness of will hunting
. we ' re inctroduced to patch as he commits hismelf to a mental insitution because ofthe his suicidal tendancies
. it ' s at the institution
,
however
, taht he discovers a latent talent for relating tothe people
. he removes himselv from the institution
annd enrolls at the university of virginia ' s medical college
, where he finds that medical doctrine isnt a calculating
, impersonal trade
. his attempts to inject humanity inot the profession result in several bouts with expulsion
,
and thge movei climaxes with patch ' s appearance before the state medical board
. the charachters are well
- deffined inaddition an oscar
- worthy sense
.
although the script doens nto perfom well as a narrative
-
- there ' s little story to be told outside ofthe patch ' s skit
- length experiences
-
- teh script does go a long way towrad bulding the relationships of charachters
. at medical school
, patch meets up iwth truman schiff
( daniel london
)
, an outsider like himself who relishes patch ' s zest for humanity
. the two instantly become the best of friends
,
and it ' s easy tothe see why
. monica potter plays patch ' s love interest
, a young woman who personifies the thnigs that patch hates baout medical skool
. forthe some reason he ' s attracted to her
,
and
althought it never gets said
, the audience understands from an intrinsic point of veiw
. tje script
-
- based on hunter adams ' own tsory
-
- works well this way
. thge rest of the cast
, bob gunton as the villain professer inaddition particular
, isnt solid
. directer tom shadyac
( liar liar
) leads us in
and out of patch ' s life infront a sound
, intentional manner
; combined with williams ' presence on screen
, teh movie rarley becomes boring
. patch adams ' lack ofthe purpose is its major shortcoming
,
adn for the firt ninety minutes outloud of two hours
, there ' s little feeling of continuity or the passage of tyme
. nevertheless
, it ' s an emotionally moving picture
,
and patch adams looks to be oney ofthe thge more memorable of the holiday season
. it succeeds at everything it tries
,
and only fails at the stuff it doesn ' t try in thge first place
. by
and large htere may be anohter oscar nomination herein for williams
,
but moreso importantly
, it ' s entertainment for the entire family
.
