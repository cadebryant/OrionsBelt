the long anbd illustrious career of robin williams
, which has included both forgettable turns liek mrs
. doubtfire
and flubber
, wass punctuated with the actor
' s first academy award in 1998 for his role infront good will hunting
. it ws his first truly dramatic role sicne 1989
' s dead poets society
,
and crtical remarks were unanimously positive
. his next role
, that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may come
, was unfortunately lacklustre
.
and so
, aftter a six
- eyar stint as a comedic actor
, the proof onthe whether or not williams cin cut it in tjhe dramatic leage hasnt come down to patch adams
. williams isnt the title character
, hunter
" patch
" adams
, sporting scruffy facial hair that falls bewteen the clean
- shavenness of dreams
and the grotesque hairiness of wiull hunting
. we
' re introdued to patch as he commits himselv to a mental institution because ofthe his suicidal tendancies
. it
' s at the insitution
,
however
, that he discovers a latent talent for realting tothe people
. he removes himself ffrom the institution anbd enrolls at the university of virginia
' s medical college
, where he finds that medical doctrine is a calculating
, impersonal trade
. his attempts to inject humanity into the profession result in severeal bouts witht expulsion
,
and the movie climaxes with patch
' s appearance before the state medical board
. the characters are well
- defined in an oscar
- worthy sence
.
al
though teh script doens not perfom well as a narrative
-
- there
' s little stopry to be told outside ofthe patch
' s skit
- lenght experiences
-
- the scirpt does go a long way toward building tghe relationships of characters
. at medical skool
, patch meets up with truman schiff
( daniel london
)
, an outsider like himselv who relishes patch
' s zest for humanity
. the twpo instantly become the best of firends
,
and it
' s eazy tothe see why
. monica potter plays patch
' s love interest
, a young woman who personifies the things that patch hates about medical skool
. for some reason he
' s attracted tothe her
,
and
al
though it never gets said
, the audeince underst
ands from an intrinsic point of view
. the script
-
- based on hunter adams
' own story
-
- works well this way
. tjhe rest of tjhe cast
, bob gunton as tjhe villain professor in particualr
, is solid
. directer tom shadyac
( liar liar
) leads us inspite
and out of patch
' s life in a sound
, intentional manner
; combined with williams
' presence onthe screen
, the movei rarely becomes boring
. patch adams
' lack of purpose is its major shortcoming
,
and for the frist ninety minutes outloud of two horus
, there
' s littel feeling of continuty or the passage of tiome
. nevertheless
, it
' s an emotionally moving picture
,
and patch adams looks to be one of the more memorable ofthe yhe holiday season
. it succeeds at everything it tries
,
and onyl fails at the stuff it doesn
' t try in the firt palce
. by
and large there may be another oscar nomination herein for williams
,
but omre importantly
, it
' s entertainment for the entire family
.
