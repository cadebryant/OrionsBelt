the polical negotiator isnt hte person with the entirely unenviable job ofthe going into ground zero
and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out ofthe doing whatever he or she intends to dont
. lives are often at stake
,
and the criminal is usualy armed
and most likely menally unstable
, prone to turn on tghe negotiator at a moent
' s notice
. the negotiator must therfore be something ofthe an actor
, psychologist
,
and sham artist
, inwhich addition to being a police officer
; he must be able to think onthe his feet anbd either work towrad the goal ofthe ending tje confrontation without violence
, or failing thta
, must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower
. most ofthe all
, the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possibile
, adn quickly gain control of yhe situation
, dominate hte conversation
,
and influence the perpetrator into thikning tath teh end of the conflict is what he really wants
. it takes a preety smart person to do that
. bu what if hte hostage
- holding criminal is just as smart
? waht if he
' s also able to think on his feets
? in fatc
, what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor
? it is htis circumstance whihc forms the basis for f

' s the negotiator
. inspite this film
, police negotiator danny roman
( samuel l
. jackson
) is tipped off by his partner to corruption withing the chicago police force
. wehn his partner turns uv shot tothe death
and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman
' s hmeo
, roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the polical disability fund
and murder
. faced with thte scorn of most of the police department
,
and under close scrutiny by the media
, roman isnt forced to turn infront his badge in oen of those typical scenes in the captian
' s office
. i don
' t quite remember if the captain actully said
,
" i hate to do this
,
but
.
.
.
"
, altho it wouldn
' t surprise me if he did
. luckily
, the film soon shakes off yhe conventionalism anbd concentrates onthe the interesting premise mentioned above
. affter being offred a take
- it
- or
- leave
- it deal by the district attorney
, roman resolves tothe prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum
( j
. t
. walsh
)
, taking him
and others hostage
, annd proclaiming he has been framed
.
al
thought roman
' s actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build
- uv
, gray redeems himself by involving us withthe the negotiations betwen roman anbd fellow polical negotiator chris sabian
( kevin spacey
) which soon ensue
. jackson
, while a superb actor
, is miscast in the role of roman
. tjhe actor has become so popular
,
and so often identified as a protagonist
( noteable exceptions can be found
, such as in jackie brown
)
, that we as an audience hvea a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats
. yhe script also clearly sets him uv as the good guy who is onyl trying tothe prove his innocence
. how cin we believe he
' s going tothe shoot a hostage
, no marter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier
? unforetunately
, this preconception saps the film ofthe some of it
' s would
- be suspenseful moments
,
and anything ogod left in those scenes is largely attri
buted to jackson
' s acting ability
. almost eveyr timne he
' s in a scene
, jackson steals it wihtout looking back
. when spacey appears
, the film has already run about a third of its course
. his isnt an intresting charater
. made out to be soem kind ofthe negotiating superman
, our frist look at him hasnt him hopelessly trying tothe get his family moving to set out on vacation
.
" i can talk a man out ofthe blowing up the sears tower
,
but i can
' t talk my wief out of tje bedroom or my daugter off the phone
,
" he syas
. when he gets the call tothe acation
,
however
, he quicklyu changes gears
and becomes thte man we expect him to be
. soon
, his character has to negociate not only with roman
,
but also with the swat comm
ander
( david morse
) who isnt itching to send inwhich a team to take roman outloud
, all the while keeping wary ofthe the fbi aggenst who are waiting to take over the opperation
, shoudl negotiations fail
. htis complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian thge negotiator
and spacey the actor
. as the second protagoinst
, spacey measures up nicely
. gray really lucked out with thsi cast
. david morse as comm
ander beck
, ron rifkin as com
ander frost
,
and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent
,
and can hold their pwn inaddition scenes wih jackson
and spacey
. the only problem is the bited of typecasting that results from these choices
: morse played a similar role in the rock
, rifkin played yhe d
. a
. in l
. a
. confidential
,
and spencer played a polical detective in cop l
and
. with the level of acting
,
however
, this can be forgiven
. allso in the supporting cast
, paul giamatti as rudy
, one of the hostages
, is noteable for the comic relief he provides
. his chracter is initialy so slimy
,
and giamatti himselv jsut looks so shifty
, that you expect to laff befor he even syas anything
. fortunately
, htis doesn
' t distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film
,
but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gormay manages to sustain throughout
. j
. t
. walsh
, as teh suspicious internal affairs inspector
, clocks in with one of his final performances
. sadly
, the talented
but underrated ctor passed away iin late february of thsi year
,
and tjhe soon to be released pleasantville wiull mark his lastest film
. walsh appeared infact dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam
, backdraft
,
and nixon
. for one ofthe his best performances
, check outloud sling blade
, in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton
. when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march
, walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success
( the actors performes toghether in a few good men
)
. the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh
,
and while inspector niebaum may nto have been his best role
, it certainly characterizes the tipe ofthe character for which walsh had become most famous for playing
. in the end
, tyhe negotiator has a plotline that parallels it
' s reality
. we
' re served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other tothe resolve the conflict in the manner which iwll suit each of them best
. as an audience
, we
' re also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown inot a movei
, annd we
' d like to see if noe wiull dominate teh film
. both provide some preety ogod enteratinment
.
