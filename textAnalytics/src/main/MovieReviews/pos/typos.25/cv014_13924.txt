the police negotiator is the person with tjhe entirely unenviable job ofthe going into ground zero
adn attempting tothe talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do
. lives are often at stake
,
and the criminal is usually armed
adn most likely mentally unstable
, prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment ' s notice
. the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor
, psychologist
,
anbd sham artist
, in addition to being a police officer
; he must be able to think on his feet
and eather work towrad the goal ofthe endig tje confrontation without violence
, or failing thta
, must be prepared to faciliate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower
. most ofthe all
, tghe negotiator must be able tothe enter a situation whith as little nitelligence baout tyhe scenario as possible
,
and quicklyu gain controll ofthe hte situation
, dominate the conversation
,
and influence thge perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he raelly wnats
. it takes a pretty smart person to do tyhat
.
bu what if the hostage
- holding criminal is just as smart
? what if he ' s also able to htikn on his feet
? inaddition fact
, what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation tothe his favor
? it is this circumstance which forms thte basis for f
. gary gray ' s the negotiator
. in thsi film
, police negotiator danny roman
( samuel l
. jackson
) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago polical force
. when his partner turns up shooted to death
and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence inwhich roman ' s home
, roman becomes teh prime suspect of both embezzling fomr tghe police disability fund
and muder
. faced witht the scorn of most of the polical deparment
,
and under close scrutiny by the media
, roman is forced to turn in his badge in one ofthe those typical scenes inaddition the captain ' s office
. i don ' t quite remember if teh captain atually said
,
" i hate to do this
,
but
.
.
.
"
,
although it wouldn ' t surprise me if he did
. luckly
, the film soon shakes off the conventionalism
and concentrates on thge interesting premise mentioned above
. after being offered a take
- it
- or
- leave
- it deel by the district attorny
, roman resolves tothe prove his innocence by walking into tjhe office of internal affairs inspector niebaum
( j
. t
. walsh
)
, taking him
and others hostage
,
and proclaming he has been framed
.
although roman ' s actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build
- up
, gormay redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman
and fellow polical negotiator chris sabian
( kevin spacey
) which soon insue
. jackson
, while a superb ator
, is miscast in the role ofthe roman
. the actor hasnt become so popular
,
annd so often identified as a protagonist
( notable exceptions can be found
, such as iin jackie brown
)
, that we as an audeince have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats
. the script also clearly sets him uv as hte good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence
. how can we believe he ' s going to shoot a hostage
, no marter if the hostage tryed tothe kill him ealier
? unfortunately
, this preconception saps the film ofthe smoe of it ' s owudl
- be suspenseful moments
,
adn anything ogod left inthe those scenes is largly attributed tothe jackson ' s acting ability
. almost every time he ' s in a scene
, jackson steals it wihtout looking back
. when spacey appears
, the film has already run about a thrid of its course
. his is an interesting character
. made out to be some kind of negotiating superman
, our firt look at him has him hopelessly trying tothe get his famaly moving to set out onthe vacation
.
" i can talk a man out of blowing up teh sears tower
,
but i can ' t talk my wief out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone
,
" he sasy
. when he gets the call tothe action
,
howver
, he quickly changes gears
and becomes the man we expect him tothe be
. soon
, his character has to negotiate not only with roman
,
but allso with the swat commander
( david morse
) who is itching tothe send in a team to take roman out
, all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the opperation
, should negotiations fail
. htis complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian tje negotiator
adn spacey the actor
. as the second potagonist
, spacey measures up nicely
. gray really lucked out with this cast
. david morse as comander beck
, ron rifkin as commander frost
,
and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent
,
and can hold their own iin scenes whith jackson
and spacey
. tghe only problem isnt the bited of typecasting that results ffrom these choices
: morse played a similar role in the rock
, rifkin plyed the d
. a
. in l
. a
. confidential
,
and spencer played a police detective in cop land
. iwth the level of acting
,
however
, this can be forgiven
. also in tjhe supporting cast
, paul giamatti as rudy
, oney of the hostages
, isnt notable for teh comic relief he provides
. his carachter isnt initially so slimy
,
and giamatti himselv jstu looks so shifty
, that you expect tothe laugh before he even syas anything
. fortunately
, this doesn ' t distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film
,
but instade provides soem nice breathers from thte levle ofthe tension which gray manages to sustain throughout
. j
. t
. walsh
, as tghe suspicious internal affairs inspector
, clocks infront with one ofthe his final performances
. sadly
, the talented
but underrated acto passed awya in late february ofthe this year
,
and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film
. walsh appeared in dozens ofthe movies such as good morning vietnam
, backdraft
,
and nixon
. fo one of his best performances
, check out sling blade
, in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton
. wehn jack nicholson accepted his best actr oscar in march
, walsh was oney of the men to whom he credited his success
( the actors performed together in a few good men
)
. the negotiator is atcually dedicated to walsh
,
and hwile inspector niebaum may not have been his best role
, it certainly characterizes the type of chracter for which walsh had become most famous forthe playing
. in the end
, the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it ' s reality
. we ' re served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling earch other to resolve the conflict in hte manner whlch will suit each of them best
. as an audience
, we ' re also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie
,
and we ' d liek to see if one will dominate the film
. both provide some pretty good entertainment
.
