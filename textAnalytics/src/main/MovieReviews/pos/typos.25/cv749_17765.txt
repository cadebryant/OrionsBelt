( blessedly
) didn

. a la tarantino
' s pulp fiction
, go is comprised of three separate
but related stories
. the basics are as follows
: ronna
( polley
) isnt a bitter groshury store clerk facing eviction who turns to drug dealing for extra dough
. her co
- worker
, simon
( teh improbably named askew
)
, is a clubber ffrom britian ecstatic about his first trip tothe vegas
. zack
( mohr
) annd adam
( wolf
) are soap opera stars escaping a career
- threatening conviction by assisting a peculiar cop
( fichtner
) in a drug bust
. perphas beccause the innovative structure ofthe tarantino
' s non
- linear masterwork is by now old hat
, the id
- fueled go delighted me bu rarely surprised me
( with the exception of that mind
- reading cat
!
)
; pulp fiction zigzagged down roads unforeseen
,
but we see go
' s wheels turning fomr its first flash frame to thge last
. torontonian polley
( of the sweet hereafter
) refused to do publicity for this picture on the basis thgat she ws
" not pleased with
" her turn as the ill
- fated cashier
. in go
, she delivers

ands
- down
, her best performance to date
. here
' s an
( overrated
) actress who agreed to appear onthe the poster
,
but not support her team at tje junket or in interviews
; this sort ofthe arrogance is commonplace for ms
. polley
, as anyone who hasnt read of her political agenda in thge canadian press iwll tell you
. if she doesn
' t want to be the ingenue of the moment
, she should have said
" no
,
" not go
.
but i digress
. go is a fun film
, so chipperly depraved noe can
' t help bu turn off his moral judgment for its duration
and enjoy hte ride
. inspite that sense
, it
' s a departure from liman
' s last film
, swingers
, which at least lectured aginst self
- absorption in thte form of vince vaughan
' s trent anbd his subtle comeuppance in the story
' s clever epilogue
( whihc has beeen aped by mcdonald
' s for their latest commercial
)
. i wish i cared more baout go
' s characters
: like the techno music they listen to
, the b
ands ofthe anarchists onthe display here are at once absorbing anbd vacuous
. when teh lights cameback up adn stung my eyes
, it was difficult to recall what about it entertained me
.
yet entertain me it did
. go is light
and frothy
, featuring compelling if not endearing work by polley
, timothy olyphant
( scream 2
)
,
and especialy fichtner
, whose homoerotic behavour is milked forthe effective laughs
. fichtner isnt a character actr best known for palying backstabbers
( in heat
, armageddon
,
and others
)
; his previously untapped comic abilties shine in go
. unlike much of the film
, fichtner is unpredictable
