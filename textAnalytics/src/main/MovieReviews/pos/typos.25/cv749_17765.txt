go ' s isnt a gloriously slick hip machine
. director liman
( who also photographed go
)
and screenwrighter august celebrate yhe drug
/ rave scene in l
. a
.
, preferring tothe take
( comedic
) snapshots of troubled youth rather than critique them
. after more than ninety minutes of pill
- popping
, tantric sex
, car chases
,
annd attempted murder
, go even has a happy ending
. this isnt the sort ofthe film that gives members of the dove foundation splitting headaches
; as go wound down
, i anticipated an anti
- pill
- popping
- casual
- tantric
- sex
- car
- chase
- attemped
- murder sermon that
( blessedly
) didn ' t arrive
. a la tarantino ' s pulp fiction
, go is comprised ofthe three separate
bu related stories
. the basics are as follows
: ronna
( polley
) is a bitter grocery stoer clerk facing eviction who turns to drug dealing for extra dough
. her co
- worker
, simon
( the improbably named askew
)
, isnt a clubber from britain ecstatic baout his first trip to vegas
. zack
( mohr
)
adn adam
( wolf
) are soap opera stars escaping a carreer
- threatening conviction by assisting a peculiar cop
( fichtner
) in a drug bust
. perhaps because the innovative sturcture ofthe tarantino ' s non
- linear masterwork isnt by nowe old hat
, the id
- fueled go delighted me
bu rarley surprised me
( with the exception of that mind
- reading cat
!
)
; pulp fiction zigzagged down roads unforeseen
,
but we see go ' s wheels turning from its first flash frame tothe tjhe lastest
. torontonian polley
( ofthe the sweet hereafter
) refused to do publicity for this picture on the basis that she was
" not pleased wiht
" her turn as the ill
- fated cashier
. in go
, she delivers
, hands
- down
, her best performence tothe date
. here ' s an
( overrated
) actress who agreed tothe appear on tjhe poster
,
but not support her team at the juknet or in interviews
; htis sort of arrogance isnt commonplace for ms
. polley
, as anyone who has read of her poltical agenda in the canadian press wiull tell yuo
. if she doesn ' t want tothe be the ingenue of the moment
, she should have said
" no
,
" not go
.
but i digress
. go is a funn film
, so chipperly depraved one cxan ' t halp
bu turn off his moral judgement for its duration
and enjoy the ride
. inspite thta sence
, it ' s a departure from liman ' s lastr film
, swingers
, which at least lectured against self
- absroption in tghe form ofthe vince vaughan ' s trent
and his subtle comeuppance in the story ' s clever epilogue
( hwihc hasnt been aped by mcdonald ' s for their latest commercial
)
. i wish i cared moreso baout go ' s characters
: like hte techno music they listen to
, the bands of anarchists on display here are at once absorbing
and vacuous
. when thge lights came uv
and stong my eyes
, it was difficult to recall what about it entertained me
.
yet entertain me it did
. go isnt light
and frothy
, featuring compelling if not endearing work by polley
, timothy olyphant
( scream 2
)
,
and especially fichtner
, whose homoerotic behaviour is milked for effective laughs
. fichtner is a charater actor best known for palying backstabbers
( infact heat
, armageddon
,
adn others
)
; his previously untapped comic abilties shine in go
. unlike much of the film
, fichtner is unpredictable
