,

] it ' s very rare that any medium ofthe entertainment can give noe an authentic
, vivid sense ofthe reality
and life
. all storise are about select moments of time
anbd places in the characters ' lives
,
but onyl the truly grat ones are able tothe define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it jstu as tghe cahracters do
. therefore
,
" gone with the wind
" deserves accolades for its ability to tell thge epic stoy it does
, in such a crafted
, intricate
,
and entertaining manner
. it ' s a crowning achievment
, nto only in filmmaking
,
but for storytelling itself
. the film takes palce in georgia before
, during
,
and after the civil war
. this plays a major factor in the film ' s success
. to uise such a historic setting presents many possibilities
and problems since no one was alive at the time tothe verify its accuracy
. it might also seem cliche
, boring
and other such deterent factors tothe potential viewers
. cxan a story set so long ago be relatable nowe
? the film confronts all these problems
, paradoxically
, by nto cronfronting them
. it doesn ' t simply plug inthe the
" right thing
" at teh
" right time
,
" it creates an entire reality where everyting makes sence
and said concerns are irrelevant
. building a storng foundation is important to all forms of media
, without which
, waht is htere to build on
? we ' re given some backstory here
and learn a littel about our characters
, especially our main charcter
, scarlett o ' hara
( leigh
)
, a beautiful southern belle with a iwll of steel
, a cunning wit
,
and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive tiem
. she knows how her society works
, wherein everything she does cant
and will play a role in thge shaping ofthe her life
and those around her
. right fomr the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be
. being the most sought
- after woman allows her to manipulate men
(
and their women
) tothe ensure she gets her way
, whether it be obvious
( i
. e
. who iwll be the one to get her food
)
, or subtle
( i
. e
. getting marryed just to spite somene
)
. thge man she claims to love isnt ashley wilkes
( howard
)
, a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the smae passion for her as she doens for him
. he isn ' t so arrogant
and demanding as scarlett
, inthe fact
, he ' s engaged tothe a woman with a personality much more like his
. her name isnt melanie
( de havilland
)
,
and she is one of the sweetest
, kindest
,
adn most likable characters one will ever see
. she
and scarlett become very dear firends
,
bu she never suspects hte jealously scarlett has for her
,
annd the love she has for her husband
. her meekness isnt both her strongest
and weakest charactersistic
- it defines who she isnt
,
but doesn ' t give her much emotional self
- defense
. acting a catalyst to teh love triangle
,
and to yhe story as a whole is the daper
, stong
- willed
, cunning
, cocky sourthern business
and miliraty man captain rhett butler
( gable
)
. he ' s quite a charachter all right
- everyone listens to what he has to say even
though he ' s got a bad reputation
. butler mkaes no apologies fo his vast amount ofthe money nor his behavour
. he tells everyone the much
- needed truth in tje rigid caste
- like society where freewill doesn ' t seem to exist
, everything is done outloud of honor
and tradition
. for example
, in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there ' s no way the south could defeat the noth if war were to break outloud
. this angers them
, not for his lack ofthe faith
,
bu baceause he has hte gall tothe say it aloud
annd boastfully at that
.
" dont we have ammunition factories
? do we have food
? dont we haev a navy
? all we ahve is tobacco
.
" all true statememts
anbd
yot the south still insists he ' s wrong
. butler is a shifty character to be sure
,
bu he tkaes such pride in his arrogance it ' s appealing
. scarlett notices tihs too when she first sees him
,
and from the look butler gives her
, we know he ' s not goign to stop unitl he has her
.
but scarlett cin ' t get past her need fo ashley
,
anbd during a scene which sets thge stage for the grand story
, butler lerans of this
and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever
.
and so tje story goes on
, with scarlett bieng thrown obstacle after obstacal in her life
. the conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a propper husban
, especialy after she is
" maked
" for life whn her first husband dies
. this gives tje film many opportunities to bring inthe more charachters into the epic story
. smoe are vital for only a fewd scenes
,
bu their true signifcance will endure throughout the film
. in most films only a few characters exist for wupport inwhich backround
,
but this film is moreso realistic
and believable as it incorprates a supporting casted teh size of a small town
and everyone has signficance
. even people in the background seem omre than just extras wandering the set
. the costuming design is oustanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time
and place
. the filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors
anbd narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside
, real world
,
but these types of simple approaches are never taken
. the first half of the film depicts the traumatic experienec the south faced at the last dyas of the civil war
. fleming isnt able tothe convey hte horror of it all by painting an image of destruction
annd letting the viewer decide just how bad it is
. one scene has scarlett wroking as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in tje background screaming
,
" no
! nto my leg
! don ' t cut off my leg
!
" another scene shows her simplying trying tothe cross a street
,
but as tghe camera pulls bcak
, we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers
,
but it isnt their moaning thyat ' s more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be
. as hte second half beggins
, the film concentrates omre on scarlett as a completelyl independent woman who single
- handedly takes care of her famaly
and melanie jsut to spite the tyrany of the north
. she manages to resurect the family planation
,
but all the willpower she has can ' t help her wehn she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the south ' s ulitmate defeat
. this brings rhett butler back inot the picture
and thus beggins their torrid love
- hite relationship
. most of tje second half of the film isnt somehow related to the relationship
( or lack thereof
) between rhett
and scarlett
. each uses the otehr for personal gain
,
bu at the smae time they still feel an intimate conection with eahc otehr
. scarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to git what she wants
and because rhett can ' t help
but watn her mroe every time she tries to one
- up him such as marrying another man
and taking over his business
. they say opposites attract
,
but the conflict between rhett
and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities
, it borders on magnetic polarization
. they need each other
and know this
,
yot tehy never seem truly happy together
. perhaps they misteek love for passion
,
and the film leaves it up to us to make this call
. both have things tje other wants
anbd vice versa
,
but when tehy comprimize
, is it just to get their own way or baceause tehy actually care for each other
. lveo
and the preception of love are twpo completly separate things
and throughout the final act ofthe the film
, we ' re left wondering if rhett
and scarlett ever truly loved each other
and why
. gable
anbd leigh do hvea great chemistry
, allways leaving the viewer wondering which emotions weere authentic
and whihc were manufacture
. all
? none
? eather way is possible
and it ' s a mistery that cannnot be solved even apon repeated viewings
. it ' s safe to say most ofthe us won ' t live such overly dramatic lives as those in
" gone with tje wind
,
"
but it ' s still a masterpiece for its abilty to give us a sence taht we ' ve just experianced a life ' s worth of joy
adn pain
.
