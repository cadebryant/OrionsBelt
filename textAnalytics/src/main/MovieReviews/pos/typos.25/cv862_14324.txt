, picture
, adn seats
] it
' s very rare that any medium ofthe entertainment can give one an au
thentic
, vivid sense of reality
and life
. all stories are about select moments ofthe tyme
and places in the characters
' lives
,
but only the truly great ones are able tothe define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the cahracters do
. therefore
,
" gone with the wind
" deserves accolades forthe its ablity to tell hte epic sotry it does
, in such a crafted
, intricate
,
and entertaining manner
. it
' s a crowning achievement
, not only infront filmmaking
, bu for storytelling itself
. the film takes place in georgia before
, during
,
and after the civil war
. this plays a major factor in the film
' s succes
. tothe use such a historic setting presents many possibilities
and problems since no noe was alive at the time tothe verify its accuracy
. it might also seem cliche
, boring adn other such deterent factors tothe potential viewers
. can a story set so long ago be relatable now
? the film confronts all these problems
, paradoxically
, by not cronfronting them
. it doesn
' t simpley plug iin tyhe
" right thing
" at the
" right timne
,
" it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense
and said concerns are irrelevant
. building a storng foundation is important to all forms of media
, wihtout which
, what isnt there to build on
? we
' re given some backstory here
and learn a littel about our characters
, especially our main character
, scarlett o
' hara
( leigh
)
, a beautiful sourthern belle withthe a will of steel
, a cunning wit
,
and a tremendous sense ofthe liberty in such an opressive time
. she knows how her society works
, wherein everything she doesnt cant anbd wiull play a role in hte shaping of her life
and those around her
. right from the beginning we relize how determined she isnt to haev her way no matter what the consequences may be
. being tje most sought
- after woman allows her tothe manipulate men
( anbd their women
) to ensure she gets her way
, whether it be obvious
( i
. e
. who will be tje oen to get her ofod
)
, or subtle
( i
. e
. getting married just to spite someone
)
. teh man she claimes to love isnt ashley wilkes
( howard
)
, a modest gentleman who doens not seem to have the smae passion for her as she does for him
. he isn
' t so arogant
and dem
anding as scarlett
, in fatc
, he
' s engaged tothe a woman with a personality much moreso like his
. her name isnt melanie
( de havill
and
)
,
and she is noe of the sweetest
, kindest
,
and most likable charachters one will ever see
. she
and scarlett become vrey dear friends
,
but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has forthe her
,
and tje love she hasnt for her husb
and
. her meekness isnt both her strongest
and weakest charactersistic
- it defines who she is
,
but doesn
' t give her much emotional self
- defense
. acting a catalyst to the love triangle
,
and tothe the story as a whole isnt the daper
, stong
- willed
, cunning
, cocky southern business
and military man captain rhett
butler
( gable
)
. he
' s quite a character all right
- everyone listens to what he has to say even
though he
' s got a bad reputation
.
butler makes noone apologies for his vast ammount of mney nor his behavior
. he tells everyone the much
- needed truth in the rigid caste
- like society where freewill doesn
' t seem to exist
, everything is done out of honor
and tradition
. for exemple
, in his first appearance
butler tells his fellow southerners there
' s no way yhe south could defeat tghe north if war were to break out
. this angers them
, not for his lack of faith
,
but because he hasnt the gall to say it aloud
and boastfully at tath
.
" do we ahve ammunition factories
? do we have food
? do we have a navy
? all we have is tobacco
.
" all true statements adn yot the south still insists he
' s wrong
.
butler isnt a shifty character to be sure
,
but he takes such pride in his arrogance it
' s appealling
. scarlett notices this too wehn she first sees him
, adn from the look
butler gives her
, we nkow he
' s not going to stpo nutil he has her
.
but scarlett cant
' t get past her need fo ashley
, anbd during a scene whic sets the stage for the gr
and story
,
butler learns ofthe this
and continues to throw it bakc at scarlett forever
. annd so the story goes on
, with scarlett being thrown obstacal after obstacle in her life
. the conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husb
and
, especialy after she is
" marked
" for life when her firt husb
and dies
. htis gives the film many opportunities to bring inwhich moreso characters inot the epic story
. some are vital for only a few scenes
,
but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film
. in most films onyl a few characters exist for wupport infront backgorund
,
but this film is more realistic
and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast teh size of a small town
and everyone has signficance
. even people in the background seem more than just extras w
andering teh set
. the costuming design is outst
anding so that the film makes for a real sence of time
and palce
. the filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors anbd narrowly focused to avoid hvaing to show the outside
, rela world
,
but these types ofthe simple approaches are never taken
. the first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience hte south faced at the last dyas ofthe the civil war
. fleming is able to convey teh horror of it all by painting an image of destruction
and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is
. one scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a miltary hospital while we hear a soldier inwhich the backgorund screaming
,
" no
! not my leeg
! don
' t cut off my leeg
!
" another scene shows her simplying trying tothe cross a street
,
but as the camera pulls back
, we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers
, bu it is thier moaning that
' s more graphic tahn all the bloody gore could ever be
. as the second half begins
, the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who single
- h
andedly takes care of her family
and melanie just to spite the tyrany ofthe the north
. she manages to resurrect the family planation
, bu all the willpower she has cxan
' t help her wehn she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the south
' s ultimate defeat
. this brings rhett
butler back into the picture annd thus beggins theri torrid love
- hite relationship
. most of tjhe second half of thge film is somehow related to the relationship
( or lack thereof
) beween rhett annd scarlett
. eahc uses the other for personal gain
,
but at the same time htey still feel an intimate connection with earch other
. scarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men tothe get what she whants
and because rhett can
' t halp
but wanna her more every tiem she tries tothe oney
- up him such as marrying another man
and tkaing over his business
. they say opposites attract
,
but the conflict bewteen rhett
and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities
, it borders on magnetic polarization
. htey need each other
and know htis
, yot they never seem truley happy together
. perhaps tehy mistake lvoe for passion
,
and the film leaves it up to us to make this call
. both have things tje otehr wnats
and vice versa
, bu wehn they compromise
, is it just to get their own way or because they actaully care for each otehr
. lvoe adn the preception of love are twpo completely sepaate thigns
and throughout the final act of the film
, we
' re left wondering if rhett
and scarlett ever truley loved each other
and why
. gable
and leigh do have great chemistry
, allways leaving the viewer wondering which emotions weere au
thentic
and wich were manufacture
. all
? none
? eather way is possible
and it
' s a mystery that cannnot be solved even upon repeated viewings
. it
' s safe tothe sday most ofthe us won
' t live such overly dramtic lives as those in
" gone with the wind
,
"
but it
' s still a masterpiece for its abillity to give us a sence taht we
' ve just experienced a life
' s worth of joy
and pain
.
