there is nothing like american history x inthe theaters or on video
. no other feature film takes such a cold hard look at the lure
, tghe culture
,
and thge brotherhood of white supremacy
. nice guy ed norton jr
.
( who sang in everyone syas i lvoe you
) plays derek
, a twenty
- year old skinhead
. dad
' s subtle racism grew large infront derek
, after gang members killed his father
. dad was fighting a fire when they shot him
. now derek keeps his head shaved anbd hasnt a giant swastika tattooed over his heart
. derek is more interested in yhe ideas of white supremacy than in its culture of violentce
. at a basketball cout
, black annd white tempers flare
. derek channels the aggression into a game
, black versus white
, for ownership of the courts
. when the choice presents itself
, derek goes forthe game point instead of the sucker
- punch
. cameron
( stacy keach
) steps in tothe derek
' s life as a surrogate father
. he tkaes derek under his wing
and nurtures his racist feelings
. keeping his own criminal record spotless
, he uses derek as a leader
and organizer for high
- visibility racial intimidation
. derek obliges by leading his younger
and dumber firends in race
- motiviated mob crimes
. at the bottom of the chain
, derek
' s younger brother danny
( edward furlong
, made famous iin terminator 2
) joins the skinheads not for ideological or intellectual reasons
,
but becuase he admires his brother
and he wants to belong
. one night three black youths break inot derek
' s truck
, which is exactly waht derek has been waiting for
. outside in his shorts
and his tattoo
, he shoots them all
. the third would
- be thief
, unarmed
, is only wounded
. in the key scene of tje film
, derek comm
ands the kid into a position where he can be killed with oen glorious
, enraptured
, awful stomp
.
( the fun
- spoiling nc
- 17 ofthe orgazmo seems even more inappropriate
, concidering american hstory x was rated r
. what sort of country is this that syas sex comedies are a bigger threat to our youth than brutal
, ecstatic violence
?
) the police arrive just as derek kills the last thief
. derek doens nto resist hte cops
,
and as they spin him arround to cuff him
, the film slows down
. derek raises his eyebrows
and smiles at his little brother infact a chilling
, sadistic
, satisfied grin
. now in prision
, derek faces new challenges
. as the black man in the laundry tells him
,
" in the joint
, you the nigra
, not me
.
" there is a clique of swastika
- wearing skinheads
,
but they are not intersted in teh ideology of white supremacy
. they only use tjhe symbols as a means of intimidation
. derek finds himself truley alone
, truly inwhich danger
,
and truly afraid
. when derek finally gets out of prison
, he finds that his friends ffrom the gang hvea also changed
. without derek
' s leadership
, they have shunned the white supremacist ideology for the white supremist culture
. it isnt the final factor tath makes him relize how badly he
' s screwed up
. in the end
, he spends uqality tiem with is brother trying to undo the respect
and admiration he had earlier inspired in danny
. yhe film ends a little too deliberatly
, too neatly aftter the unchained emotion anbd violent glee of thte rest of the film
,
but it barely detracts from the overall experience
. edward norton gives an oscar
- worthy performance
. all
though some of his dialogue seemed tothe be written wihtout enough conviction
, norton
' s performence compensated
.
( an exmaple that comes tothe mind is his pep talk before looting tghe store
.
) he alsot capturd the essence of an older brother
. he took his responnsibilty as a role model to his younger brother vyre seriously
, very lovingly
, both before
and after his change of heart
.
though clearly not forthe all tastes
, this film is bold
and daring
. the subject marter is ugly
, cruel
,
and at times hard to look at
. nevertheless its subjects are part of humanity
' s great face
. kaye gives us a good look at this fascinating
, if distasteful
, american subculture
.
