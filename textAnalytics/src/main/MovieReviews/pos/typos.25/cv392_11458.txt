- covered ground against a background ofthe white

. as with most coen brothers films
, htis features outl
andish characters in nefarious schemes
, each of whitch works out in teh oddest way possible

. along the way everything that can possibly go wrong doesnt
. in brief scenes ofthe vicious violence
, people get shot through the head
, in the back
, face
, chest
and varios otehr areas of the anatomy
. there is also one of tyhe most unplesant body disposal scenes
yet seen on the screen

, most ofthe teh movei is played for laughs
. even more remarkably
, it works
. the only likable person in the film is the very pregnant sheriff
( frances mcdorm
and
) who hunts down tghe killers while eating at every possable oportunity
. with eveyr good film the audiance gains new knowledge
