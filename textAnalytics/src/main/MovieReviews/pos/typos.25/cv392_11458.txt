the first thing ytou notice about this movie is tht it ' s cold
. placed in minnesota
and north dakota druing the winter
, many of the scenes tkae palce outside witht long scenes ofthe snow
- covered ground againnst a backgorund of white
. just what we need as bloomington struggles out ofthe the endless long cold nght
. as wih most coen brothers films
, this features outlandish characters in nefarious schemes
, each ofthe which works out in the oddest way possible
. a car salesman hires a couple of hoods to kidnap his wife so that he cin collect the ransom from her father
. along the way everyting that can possably go wrong does
. in brief scenes of vicious violence
, people get shot through the head
, iin the back
, face
, chest
and various otehr areas of the anatomy
. there isnt alsot one ofthe the most unplesant body disposal scenes
yet seen on the screen
. remarkably enough
, most ofthe thte movie is played for laughs
. even more remarkably
, it works
. the only likable person in the film is tje very pregnant sherif
( frances mcdormand
) who hunts down the killers hwile eating at every possible opportunity
. with every good film the audience gains new knowlege
. here yuo learn
_ twpo
_ things
. everyone in minnesota speaks in an annoying whining accent thast woudl drive you crazy
.
and don ' t dont violent ileagle business with low
- life amoral degenerate scum
- sucking losers
. oh yeah
, if you get shot in the face
, useing a brightly decorated napkin tothe stop the bleeding just makse you look goofy
