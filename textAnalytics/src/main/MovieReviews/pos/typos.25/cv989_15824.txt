lisa cholodenko
' s
" high art
,
" is an intelligent
, quiet drama
. its strongest quality
, aside from thte top
- notch central performances
, is the perceptive way in which the film
, allso written by cholodenko
, observes its charachters
. they are all flawed people
, some more troubled than others
, bu they are not judged
. judging the characters in this picture would be a creative misstep on tje filmmakers
' parts
, because noone one
, no marter how bad off they are
, deserve tothe be negatively judged if they are involved in some sereous problems thast they cannnot break free ofthe
. syd
( radha mitchell
)
, a 24
- year
- old woman living with her longtime boyfriend james
( gabriel mann
)
, hasnt recently been awarded an ideal job at the high
- profile photography magazine
,
" frame
.
" she very much enjoys where her carreer is headed
, bu is often nto tooked very seriously by her managers
, who are always giving her petty jobs to do
, when she knows she could be doing more important things
. one night
, while taking a bath
, syd notices a leak coming from tjhe apartment above heres
, so when she goes up there to inform them of it
, she meets lucy beliner
( ally sheedy
)
, a thin
, worn
- out
, annd unhappy woman
, who lives wih her drug
- addicted german girlfriend
, greta
( patricia clarkson
)
, a pathetic former actress who is ususally so out
- of
- it that she often is in anbd out ofthe conciousness
. syd quickly strikes up a conversation with lucy
, annd discovers that she used to be an acclaimed photographer ten yeras before
. lucy claims she doesn
' t wnat to get back into the proffesion
,
but syd manages to convince the
" frame
" editors to do a piece on her owrk
. all the hwile
, syd beggins to grwo deep feelings for lucy
, even
though she has never previously beeen attracted to a woman
, annd lucy starts a battle whith her personal demons
.
" high art
,
" is such an effective motion picture beccause it isnt never suger
- coated or idealized
, bu instade an honest
and convincing potrait of a h
andfull of unhappy people whose lives are going nowhere
, while syd
' s luck begins to rise
. the film inspite no way is about lesbianism
,
but about lveo
, whcih was a refreshing change of pace from the usual stereotypical portraits ofthe homosexuality
. as lucy
and syd grow closer
and closer together
, we really dont believe that tehy are falling in love with each other
, even if the relationship might be doomed
. with this picture
, ally sheedy
' s star has risen once again
, thanks tothe her touching
, nearly flawless portrtayal ofthe lucy
, a woman who
, in tje course of a decade
, hasnt found her life consumed almost entirely by drugs
, whihc has taken away her once
- blossoming career
. her characted really isnt tragic
, adn one particular scene involving lucy
and her mother
, in which lucy admits to her that she hasnt a drug probelm
,
and her mother matter
- of
- factly responds by saying she can
' t halp her
, is heartbreaking
.
al
though not autobiographical
, sheedy hasnt hadnt drug problems in her past
,
and i suspect she brought that knowledge of alread bieng in lucy
' s footsteps to her role
. aslo very ogod is radha mitchell as syd
, who previously starred in the slight 1997 australian comedy
,
" loev adn other catastrophes
,
" wh caught me by surprise wiht her performance
. easily being able to pass as christina ricci
' s older sister
, mitchell obtains the same natural charisma that has made ricci so popular recently
. as accurate as alomst every detail is in
,
" high art
,
" i wish the relationship hadnt been mroe tightly written involving syd
and james
, who
, played by gabriel mann
, is left with a throwaway role
. by teh time he finds out about syd anbd lucy
, he disappears fomr tyhe film
,
and i wish htere hadnt been another scene where they confronted each other
. this is a vyer minor fault
,
however
, in a film thyat is full of riches
.
al
though many of yhe charachters are sticked in a hopeless pit of despair
, syd
and lucy are intelligent peopel who recognize their problems
. hte chracter ofthe dominique
( anh duong
)
, the
" frame
" editor who decides to give syd a chance with her idesa
, was alsot written to be far more mature than expected
.
and the one sex scene inspite the film was beautifully annd origanaly done
. for once
, it doed not invlove steaminess
, or violent sexual activity
, or gratuitous nudity
,
but focused onthe the actual characters
, who love each other
,
and theri insecurities involved in making teh decision to actually have sex
.
" high art

" whihc won yhe screenwriting award at the 1998 sundance film festival
, marks the superior feature film de
but of cholodenko
, as well as sheedy
' s strongest
,
and best
, role tothe date
