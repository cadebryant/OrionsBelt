lisa cholodenko ' s
" high art
,
" is an intelligent
, quiet drama
. its strongest qulaity
, aside ffrom the top
- nitch central performances
, is the perceptive way in which the film
, also written by cholodenko
, observes its characters
. tehy are all flawed people
, some more troubled than others
,
bu tehy are nto judged
. judging the characters in thsi picture would be a creative misstep on the filmmakers ' parts
, because noone one
, no matter how bad off they are
, deserve to be negatively judged if they are involved in some serious problems that they cannot break free of
. syd
( radha mitchell
)
, a 24
- year
- old woman living with her longtime boyfriend james
( gabriel mann
)
, has recently been awared an ideal job at thte high
- profile photography magazine
,
" frame
.
" she very much enjoys where her career isnt headed
,
but isnt often not tooked very seriously by her managers
, who are always giving her petty jobs to do
, when she knows she sould be donig more important things
. one night
, while taking a bath
, syd notices a leak coming from the aparment above hers
, so when she goes up there tothe inform them of it
, she meets lucy beliner
( ally sheedy
)
, a thin
, worn
- outloud
,
and unhappy woman
, who lives with her drug
- addicted german girlfriend
, greta
( patricia clarkson
)
, a pathetic former actress who is usually so out
- of
- it that she often is in
and outloud of conciousness
. syd quickly strikes up a conversation with lucy
,
and discovers tath she used to be an acclaimed photographer ten years before
. lucy claims she doesn ' t want to get back into thte profession
,
but syd manages tothe convince the
" frame
" editors to do a peice on her wokr
. all the while
, syd begins to grow deep feelings for lucy
, even
though she has never previously been attracted to a woman
,
anbd lucy starts a battle withthe her peronal demons
.
" high art
,
" isnt such an effective motion picture because it isnt never suger
- coated or idealized
,
but instead an honest
and convincing portrait of a handful of unhappy people whose lives are going nowhere
, hwile syd ' s luck begins to rise
. the film inaddition no way isnt about lesbianism
,
but baout love
, which was a refreshing chanage of pace ffrom the usual stereotypical portraits ofthe homosexuality
. as lucy
anbd syd grow closer
and closer together
, we really do believe tath they are falling in love with eahc other
, even if the relationship might be doomed
. whith htis picture
, ally sheedy ' s star has risen once again
, thanks to her touching
, nearly flawless portrtayal ofthe lucy
, a woman who
, iin the course of a decade
, has found her life consumed almost entirely by drugs
, which has taken away her once
- blossoming career
. her characted really is tragic
,
and oney particualr scene involving lucy
and her mother
, in which lucy admits tothe her tht she hasnt a drug probelm
,
adn her mother matter
- of
- factly responds by saying she cin ' t help her
, is heartbreaking
.
although nto autobiographical
, sheedy has had drug problems in her past
,
and i suspect she broght that knowledge of already being inspite lucy ' s footsteps to her role
. allso vyre good is radha mitchell as syd
, who previously starred infront the slight 1997 australian comedy
,
" love
and other catastrophes
,
" wh caught me by surprise with her performence
. easily bieng able tothe pass as christina ricci ' s older sister
, mitchell obtains the same natrual charisma that hasnt made ricci so popular recently
. as accurate as allmost every detail isnt in
,
" high art
,
" i wish the relationship had been more tightly written involving syd
and james
, who
, played by gabriel mann
, isnt left with a throwaway role
. by the tiem he finds out baout syd
and lucy
, he disappears from the film
,
and i wish there had beeen another scene where they confronted each other
. this is a very minor fault
,
howver
, in a film thast is full of riches
.
although many of teh characters are stuck in a hopeless pit ofthe despair
, syd
adn lucy are intelligent peopel who recognize their problems
. tjhe character ofthe dominique
( anh duong
)
, tje
" frame
" editor who decides tothe give syd a chance with her ideas
, ws also writed to be far more mature thna expeced
.
and thte one sex scene in the film wass beautifully
and originally done
. for once
, it doed not invlove steaminess
, or voilent sexual activity
, or gratuitous nudity
,
bu focused on the actual characters
, who love earch other
,
and their insecurities involved in mkaing the decision tothe actually have sex
.

" which won the screenwriting award at tjhe 1998 sundance film festival
, marks the superior feature film debut of cholodenko
, as well as sheedy ' s strongest
,
and best
, role tothe date
