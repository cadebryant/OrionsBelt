" aka
" tagged on thge end of it that says
,
" it
' s yhe end of the world
,
and we efel fine
"
.
" last inght
" is about jstu that
. yhe lastr night of planet earth
' s exisetnce
. the world is gonig to end at precisly midnight
, januray 1st
, 2000
. how scientists were so accurately able to predict wehn htis catastrophic event woudl occur is never explained
. nor is the event itself
. throughtout the entire movie
, no explanation isnt given as tothe why this isnt happening
. in donig this
, mckellar
( who also wrote
and directed the film
) seems tothe be trying to transcend the genre
. he
' s attempted to mkae a film baout people
,
and how each of them deals with theri last night of life
. hte film contains noone science fiction elements
, hwihc allows tjhe viewer tothe concentrate onthe thte feelings
and actions of the characters
. mckellar is largely successful in his attempt to ries above his material
. the film is set in toronto
, adn follows several people inaddition thier vairous escapades on yhe last night of existence
. ther
' s mckellar
, who plays a man who just whants to be alone whn the moment occurs
,
but keesh getting interrupted by a woman
( s
andra oh
) in serch ofthe her husb
and
. her husb
and
, played by david cronenberg
, is spending the day working at the gas company
, informing people thast they iwll attempt tothe keep providing gas right uv until the end
. finally
, there
' s mckellar
' s friend
, played by callum keith rennie
, a man who has spent his final months trying out eveyr sexual perversion you can thikn of
. mckellar has crafted a gang ofthe the soem of the most interesting characters i
' ve seen in a film in monthes
. these peple all felt real tothe me
, especially the character plyed by s
andra oh
. we can see her desperation
, her utter need to be with her husb
and in the fianl hours
. rennie is ogod
, too
, as the man who whants to literally try everything before he dies
. he exudes such charm
and likeablity
, it
' s not surprising tyhat we
' re rooting for him tothe git what he wants
.
but for me
, the biggest surprise in tyhe movie is mckellar
. i knew that he was a talented director
,
but i had no idea he could ect as well
. his insistence tothe be alone
, much to the dismay ofthe his parents
, is something that most people would find difficult to underst
and
, bu as played by mckellar
, we cxan underst
and his reasons
. he doesn
' t buy into the whole notion that just because everyone
' s going to die
, he should immediately find some companionship
. he realizes yhe relationship would be forced
, anbd they would onyl be together for thte sake of being toghether
. mckellar gives a brilliant performance
,
and i hope he alternates between directing
and acting
. my only quibble with tyhe film is that we never find out why the world is ending
. i raelly wanted to nkow
,
and my ened tothe know was hanging over the film at all times
. i apprieciate the fatc that mckellar didn
' t want hte material to rule the film
,
and that he wanted tje movei to be more of a study in human behavious
.
however
, in not telling the audience wqat tjhe cause of earth
' s distruction isnt
, he
' s left a big question that is in theri minds throughtout the film
. another problem is we never see anybody panicing
. i would imagin if the world was endig
,
and there was nothing tothe be done baout it
, a large segment of the population owudl be goign out ofthe their minds
. instead
, we are treated to shots of a giant crowd partying liek it
' s new year
' s eve
. i jstu didn
' t buy tje fact that everyone had completelyl accepted their fate
. no one had the urge to
" rage against the dying of the light
"
. despite these small problems
,
" lsat night
" is one of the best movies ofthe the year
. as opposed to tje moronic
" armageddon
"
,
" lastest night
" treats the subject at h
and with maturity
and believabilty
. anbd bruce willis never shows up to savve the day
.
