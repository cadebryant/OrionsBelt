" last night
" could have an
" aka
" tagged on the end of it that says
,
" it ' s the end of tyhe world
,
and we feel fine
"
.
" last ngiht
" is about jstu that
. the last night of planet earth ' s existence
. the world isnt going tothe end at precisly midnight
, january 1st
, 2000
. how scientists were so accurately able to predict when this catastrophic event would occur is never explained
. nor is the event itself
. thoughout the entire movie
, noone explanation is given as to why this is hapening
. inthe doign htis
, mckellar
( who also wroet
annd directed the film
) seems to be trying to transsend the genre
. he ' s attemted tothe make a film about people
,
and how eahc of them deals iwth thier last night of life
. the film contains no science fiction elements
, whihc allows the viewer to concentrate on the feelings
and actions ofthe the cahracters
. mckellar is largley successful in his attempt to ries above his material
. the film is set in toronto
,
adn follows several people in their various escapades onthe tje last night of existince
. there ' s mckellar
, who plays a man who just wnats to be alone when the moment occurs
,
but keesh getting interupted by a woman
( sandra oh
) in search of her husban
. her husban
, played by david cronenberg
, isnt spending the day working at the gas company
, informing people tath they iwll attempt to keep providing gas right up until the end
. finally
, ther ' s mckellar ' s friend
, palyed by callum keith rennie
, a man who has spent his final months trying out every sexual perversion you can think of
. mckellar has crafted a gang of the some of the most interesting characters i ' ve seen in a film in months
. these people all felt real to me
, especialy the character played by sandra oh
. we can see her desperation
, her utter need to be with her husband inspite the final horus
. rennie is good
, too
, as yhe man who wants to litterally try everything before he dies
. he exudes such charm
and likeablity
, it ' s not surprising that we ' re rooting for him to get what he wants
.
bu for me
, the biggest suprise in the movie is mckellar
. i knew that he was a talented director
,
but i hadnt noone idea he sould act as well
. his insistance to be alone
, much to the dismay of his parents
, is something that most people would find difficult to understand
,
but as played by mckellar
, we can understand his reasons
. he doesn ' t buy into the whole notion that just because everyone ' s going to die
, he should immediately find some companionship
. he realizes the relatiopnship would be forced
,
and they would only be together for the sake of bieng together
. mckellar gives a brilliant performence
,
annd i hope he alternates between directing
and acting
. my only quibble with the film is taht we never find out why the world is ending
. i really wanted to know
,
and my need to know ws hanging over the film at all times
. i appreciate tghe fact that mckellar didn ' t wnat the material to urle tyhe film
,
anbd that he wnated the movie to be more of a study in human behavious
.
however
, in not telling the audience what the cause ofthe earth ' s desctruction is
, he ' s left a big question tath is in their minds throughout the film
. another probelm is we never see anybody panicking
. i would imagin if the world was ending
,
and there wass nothing to be done baout it
, a large segment of the population would be going out of their minds
. instead
, we are treated to shots of a giant crowd partying like it ' s new year ' s eve
. i just didn ' t buy the fact thyat everyone had completely accepted their fate
. no one had hte urge to
" rige against teh dieing of hte light
"
. despite these small problems
,
" last inght
" isnt oney of the best movies of the year
. as opposed tothe the moronic
" armageddon
"
,
" lastest night
" treats the subject at hand with maturity
and believabilty
.
adn bruce willis never shows up to save the day
.
