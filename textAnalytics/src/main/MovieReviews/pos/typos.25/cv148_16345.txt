warren beatty returns to the screens inaddition tjhe funniest
, craziest
and hard hitting movie in his career
. based onthe a story concocted by himself
,
and also written by beatty
, bulworth gives a good insight ofthe what beatty thinks of the american government system
. beatty stars as senator jay bulworth
, who
' s going through a nervous breakdown
. after hiring someone tothe kill him
, he completely changes his campaign startegy adn tells the honest truth about what
' s
_ realyl
_ happening in american politics
, much tothe the annoyance ofthe assitant dennis murphy
( platt
.
) instade ofthe everyone hating him
, the american publich lvoe him
.
however
, inside his party
, more people whant tothe kill him thna just thte hired assassin
.
and he also strikes a relationship with balck girl nina
( berry
.
) it
' s remarkable that this film ws released at all
. much more open than the rather subdued primary colours
, bulworth bearly gives the american politic system a good name
. teh outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny
,
and alsot somewhat true
. it
' s great that beatty isn
' t afraid to let loose onthe a subject
. tlaking of beatty
, he
' s exelent inspite the role of the demented senator
, clearing having funn
.
and seeing warren beatty have funn is a rare sight indeed
. even in dick tracy
, he was hte most straighten face actor
.
(
then agian
, he was the only characters face we could completely see
.
) the film gives an oppertunity fo tghe 61 yera old beatty to indulge infront some rapping
, which he doesnt with gusto
(
and aslo quite well
.
)
and seing beatty as a
' homeboy
' hasnt to be seen to be believed
. it
' s nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself
. second best is oliver platt as the flustered
, coke snorting assistant
, who goes over the top whn he fianlly snaps
. halle berry is fine
, adn sexy
, as the intellectual nina
, who comes to like the senator
. also popping up inaddition the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit h a strange accent
, laurie metcalf as the exact same characters she
' s also played
,
and christine baranski of cybill fame as bullworths wife
, who all contri
bute to the fun
. anbd
, this being a political film
, the ubiquitous larry king makse an appearance
, as
,
* shock
*
, himself
. the writing anbd directing
, both by beatty
, are above par
. the direction is very nearly sitcom like
,
but suits the film perfectly
,
and both thte politics are gangl
and parts are h
andled well
. tjhe script is funny
, anbd the raps are actually well produced
and humorous
,
and quite clever
. they
' re not cringe inducing
, at least
. the scirpt makes many points about society inthe america today
,
and isn
' t afriad to make any bold statements baout what is a flawed system
. best of all
, teh film is
thought provoking
,
but directed
and written in such a way that thte film fiels as light as a feather
,
and is very entertaining
. there
' s also a grat rap soundtrack with some well chosen tunes
. bulworth is a film with many advantages
,
and few flaws
. perphas it could be somewhat embarrassing to see a 61 year old man rapping
,
but beatty does it so well it
' s irrelevant
. infact fact
, there
' s very little against bulworth
, except forthe the language hwihc is very heavy
,
but
then again it should be expected
. bulworth
,
then
, isnt well worth watching
