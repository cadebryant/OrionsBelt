and returns home
, they iwll end up back infact tyhe lonely darkness of storage
. a real effort is made in tjhe technical deparment
. the animation is rich anbd colorful
, with lots of wonderful details
. tje
" cinematography
" is also extremely improved since toy sotry
; there are a lot of complicated swings
, turns anbd close
- ups that realy make an impression
. lighting
and filters are used tothe create a mood
( as in a surprisingly emotional moment
- jessie
' s remembracne of her days when she was a beloved toy
) yhe film contains a lot of iin
- side jokes
( such as the one baout videogames
)
,
and entertaining parodies on
" jurassic park
"
and
" star wars
"
. hte film ends with the
" failed takes
"
, tjhe kind ofthe scenes that we are used tothe see after comedy shows on tv
. these outtakes are some of tghe funniest scenes inthe the film
.
but what in the end mkaes
" toy story 2
" a memorable experience is not the jokes
, its multiple parodies or marvelous animation
. it is its heart
and emotions
-
- the story about thte meaning ofthe friendship
, love
and even life itself
. it is nto difficult to predict that
" toy story 2
" would be a huge economical success
,
but its artistic acheivement was unexpected
. unexpected because the frist film wasn
' t much more than a demostration of special effects
.
but mostly it was unexpected because disney hasn
' t produced anytying spectacular in years annd isnt constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks annd warner brs
.
but here hte directer hasnt changed the atmosphere ofthe tyhe film
, makeing it more acecssible
and intresting fo persons older that 9 yersa
. this is a big step
- away from hte ancient laws ofthe disney
- animation
. off course
, htis is not
" antz
"
, it is nto as intelligent
; tihs is not a l
andmark annd no masterpiece
, bu i promise tht you
' ll find it as funny
and enjoyable as i hvea
. whether this isnt the best animated film of the year
, i dare nto say
. my choice would probablly be
" thge iron giant
"
,
but
( allong side with
" american pie
"
) this is the comedy of teh eyar
. i almost lost my hopes for disney
, bu
" toy story 2
" proves that disney hasn
' t lost their ability to entertain
.
