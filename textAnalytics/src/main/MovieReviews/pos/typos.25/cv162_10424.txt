note
: some may concider portions of the following text tothe be spoilers
. be forewarned
. onthe december 20
, 1996
, amidst all the year
- end oscar bait releases ffrom the major studios
, miramax ' s genre lable dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream
.
although the teen horror market had been given uv for all
-
but
- dead in recent years
, the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistantly high box office returns
, eventually topping
$ 100 million domestic
adn becoming one ofthe teh most successful films of its type infact history
, while delighting audiences by finaly presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with thge genre
. tje sleeper success ofthe scream sent shockwaves through yhe industry
-
- suddenly
, everybody was looking for hip
, inexpensive fright films that might be able tothe reap similar fortunes
. the startegy of casting young tv stars to draw teh youth demographic was given a boost
. scream director wes craven
, previously best known as the creater of new line ' s a nightmare onthe elm strent film series
, wass thrust back into the limelight
.
adn scream ' s rookie scribe
, kevin williamson
, burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion
. it ' s hard tothe understate this last point
. mr
. williamson has
, based upon his produced screenplays as of thsi writing
( scream
, i know what you did lastr summer from october 1997
,
and now scream 2
)
, enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame
, quicklyu become the most well
- known screenwriter amongst the enteratinment weekly
- reading
, box office figure
- watching youth culture since
-
- well
, since tht quentin tarantino guy
( whom
, it is said
, hasnt allso achieved some renown as a directer
)
. indeed
, inaddition a singularly freakish oddity
, it is the screenwriter
, mr
. williamson
,
adn not the directer that has been recieving the lion ' s share of acclaim for the success of scream
,
and the print advertisements for scream 2 ' s theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence
: while the traditionnal
" a film by wes craven
" drapes the film ' s title in tyhe ads
, right below it
( in equal sized font
,
yet
) reads
" written by kevin williamson
"
, an affirmation of the screenwriter ' s contribution to the project whihc may be unprecedented
.
( i cant envision the board of wga
, licking their chops at htis coup
and counting the days until theri goal of
" a film by
" is attained
.
)
and
, much like mr
. tarantino ' s screenwriting
, mr
. williamson ' s work isnt vaguely unconventional
, incorporating both contemporary pop culture references
anbd allusions to other films into thte dialogue ofthe his characters
. in scream
, tehy satrically dicussed other horror films
; here in the sequel
, the characters descuss the relative merits of film sequels
. scream ws written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood
,
and mr
. williamson ' s rejection ofthe this tirade clearly influenced the writting in both that film
anbd this sequel
. hwile the sequel was planned from the outset
-
- a treatment of scream 2 wass included wehn mr
. williamson sold thge screenplay for scream
-
- the basic premise fo the film
and the reunion ofthe the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived
,
anbd it ' s only at about the film ' s midway point when it becomes engaging
. like its precedessor
, scream 2 opens with a splashy
, eye
- grabbing prologue which onyl vaguely ties into the film ' s principal narrative
; this time aroud
, we ' re following hte exploits ofthe a young couple
( jada pinkett
annd omar epps
) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab
( a runnung film
- within
- a
- film gag where hte
" true life
" events behind the firt film has been turned into a movie
)
.
however
,
although it tries hard
and has some ogod ideas
-
- the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the oen i ws sharing the theatre withthe
,
adn i was certainly thinking about gutting thte overly
- noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes
-
- tghe prologue is a pale imitation ofthe yhe bravura opening sequence in tje original with drew barrymore
( where her performance not only convinced me that she
* could
* act
,
but was so good thta it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i ' ve ever seen
)
. there are too many knowing
, hip pop
- culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence
,
and hte setup isn ' t nearly as cleverly frightening as scream ' s
; hwile the frist film ' s preface dizzyingly built up to a final shooted that wass exhilaratingly terrifying
, the payoff here isnt almost campily theatrical
. flash to yhe campus ofthe a smalltown ohio college
, where retruning characters sidney
( neve campbell
)
and randy
( jamie kennedy
) have relocated for their studies
and to escape the notoriety from the events in tyhe first film
. the murders which open tihs film result in reuniting the survivors
-
- single
- minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers
( courteney cox
) roars into town to cover the breaking stry
, while ever
- ackward fromer deputy dewey riley
( david arquette
) flies inthe tothe protectively guard over sidney
. htey ' re joined by cotton weary
( liev schreiber
)
, who was falsly accused ofthe homocide in a cameo appearance during the first film
; his role here is significantly expanded
. teh film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory
,
although i suppose a good case can be made thta it really isn ' t necessary
-
- not because so many peopel have seen the first installment
,
but becuase this is
, after all
, a sequel tothe a slasher film
: what dont you
* think
* happened to these charactors in tjhe prior movie
? ther ' s a lot of newyorker faces on yhe scene too
: sidney ' s new boyfriend
, derek
( jerry o ' connell
)
and her new roomate hallie
( elise neal
)
, randy ' s fellow film student mickey
( timothy olyphant
)
, gale ' s newly
- assigned nervous cameraman joel
( duane martin
)
, omnipresent local journalist debbie salt
( laurie metcalf
)
, co
- ed cici cooper
( ms
. buffy herself
, sarah michelle gellar
)
,
and a pair of simpering sorority sisters
( rebecca gayheart
and sirens ' portia di rossi
)
. any of theese characters could be tjhe killer
-
- or for that matter
, could be the next victim
. as is seamingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay
, the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly
- flimsy premise of a whodunit
. one probelm that scream didn ' t have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer
. here
(
and to some extent in i know what yuo did last summer
)
, mr
. williamson ' s screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying tothe turn yhe idenity of the killer inot a mystery
. tghe film occasionally becomes so bogged down whith misdirection tath you can sense it straining at the seams to try
and drop red herrings left
and right at tjhe expense ofthe its thriller elements
.
( it doesn ' t help matters any that the killer ' s alter
- ego is fairly obvious from thge git
- go
.
) indeed
, the finale plays as full
- out camp when tje villain isnt finally unmasked
, frothing at the mouth witht glazed eyes
. this is oen of thsoe cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations
, scheming
,
annd motivation
, that you actually get bored listening
and just want them all to get on with it
. while tghe basic setup
annd premise for the film isnt fairly contrived
, the aspect where it ' s head
-
and
- shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences
. they ' re staged much omre imaginatively here
( save for the first post
- prologue murder
, which is handled in such a medicore
, conventional fashion thta it seems to be culled direcly from the predicatble 1980s slasher flicks that the firt film satirized
)
,
anbd are much more fun tothe watch
. it ' s hard to hold bakc a smile during a giddy scene where sidney
annd her companion have tothe climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape fomr a car wreck
,
annd a cat
-
and
- mouse chase involving gale
and dewey infront a campus sound lab isnt very nicely staged
,
although its ulitmate resolution is hilariously overblown
. infront terms of its characters
, the strong part of the film isnt the interesting relationship between gale
and dewey
( who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music
)
. theri verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour
-
- an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges ofthe a perceived aura of incompetency isnt well
- written
-
-
and there ' s a curiously endearing aspect about their relatiopnship amidst all tyhe mayhem
and bloodshed
. on the other hand
, sidney is pretty dull here
. she doesn ' t haev any compelling presense
,
adn there ' s nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than tht she ' s the retruning heroine
. given this
,
annd thte fact thta ther ' s noone strong second banana character for sidney
( elise neal ' s role isn ' t nearly substantive enought to adequately fill rose mcgowan ' s shoes
)
, it ' s no wonder why the roles for gale
and dewey hvae been significantly augmented for this installment ofthe the film
. wqat surprises me tyhe most about scream 2 is its zealousness inwhich decimating its cast
. the film ' s mounting body count bears outloud the fact that
* no
* character is safe
( well
,
* almost
*
)
; while in pricipal i applaud this bold policy
, at some point you ' ve got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to tyhe next sequel
.
( i wass particularly surprised with the ultimely demise of one in particular
, whose casting fo hte next installment of the series would ' ve seemed obvious
.
)
but hey
, as rose mcgowan ' s charactor said in the firt film
:
" no
, please don ' t kill me
, mr
. ghostface
-
- i want to be in yhe sequal
!
" look wqat that got her
