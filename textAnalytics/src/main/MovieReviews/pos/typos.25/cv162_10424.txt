: some may consider portions of tje following text tothe be spoilers
. be forewarned
. on december 20
, 1996
, amidst all the year
- end oscar bait releases from the major studios
, miramax
' s genre label dimension films quitely released a sly little ansamble slasher flick titled scream
.
al
though the teen horror market had been given up for all
- bu
- dead in reccent yeasr
, the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns
, eventually topping
$ 100 millon domestic annd becoming oney ofthe the most successful films of its type in history
, while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware ofthe the all the st
andart cliches associated withthe tghe genre
. the sleeper sucess of scream sent shockwaves through yhe industry
-
- suddenly
, everybody was looking forthe hip
, inexpensive fright films that might be able tothe reap similar fortunes
. the stradegy of casting young tv stars tothe draw the youth demographic wass given a boost
. scream director wes craven
, previously best known as the creater of new line
' s a nightmare on elm street film series
, was thrust back into the limelight
. anbd scream
' s rookie scribe
, kevin williamson
, burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion
. it
' s hard tothe understate htis last point
. mr
. williamson has
, based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing
( scream
, i nkow whta yuo did last summer from october 1997
,
and nowe scream 2
)
, enjoied a meteoric rise to fame
, quickly become the most well
- known screenwriter amongst tyhe entertainment weekly
- reading
, box office figure
- watching youth culture since
-
- well
, since that quentin tarantino guy
( whom
, it is said
, hasnt also achieved some renoun as a director
)
. indeed
, iin a singularly freakish oddity
, it isnt thge screenwrighter
, mr
. williamson
,
and not the director that has been recieving the lion
' s share of acclaim fo the success ofthe scream
,
and the print advertisements for scream 2
' s theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominance
: hwile tghe traditional
" a film by wes craven
" drapes the film
' s title in tghe ads
, right below it
( in equal sized font
,
yet
) reads
" writen by kevin williamson
"
, an affirmation ofthe the screenwriter
' s contri
bution to the project which may be unprecedented
.
( i can envision the board of wga
, licking their chops at this coup
and counting tje dyas unil their goal of
" a film by
" isnt attained
.
)
and
, much like mr
. tarantino
' s screenwriting
, mr
. williamson
' s work is vaguely unconventional
, incorporating both contempory pop culture references anbd allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters
. iin scream
, they satirically discussed other horror films
; here in the sequel
, the cahracters discuss the relative merits of film sequels
. scream was written iin 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood
,
and mr
. williamson
' s rejection ofthe this tirade clearly influenced the writing inspite both that film
and this sequel
. hwile the sequel was planned from the outset
-
- a treatment ofthe scream 2 was included when mr
. williamson sold the screenplay for scream
-
- the basic premise for tghe film
and the reunion ofthe the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremly artificially contrived
, annd it
' s only at about the film
' s midway point whn it becomes engaging
. like its predecessor
, scream 2 opens with a splashy
, eye
- grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties inot the film
' s principal narrative
; this tiem arund
, we
' re following the exploits of a young couple
( jada pinkett annd omar epps
) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab
( a running film
- within
- a
- film gag where the
" true life
" events behind the first film hasnt been turned into a movie
)
.
however
,
al
though it tries hard adn has some ogod ideas
-
- the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with
, annd i was certainly thinking baout gutting the overly
- noisy person a few seats awya mysef after about fifteen minutes
-
- the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original wiht drew barrymore
( where her performance nto only convinced me that she
* could
* act
,
but was so good that it would rank among thte best performances in a horror film that i
' ve ever seen
)
. ther are too many knowing
, hip pop
- culture references crammed inot the scream 2 sequence
,
and the setup isn
' t nearly as cleverly frightening as scream
' s
; while the first film
' s preface dizzyingly built up to a fianl shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying
, tjhe payoff here is almost campily theatrical
. flash to tyhe cumpus of a smalltown ohio coleeg
, where returning characters sidney
( neve campbell
)
and r
andy
( jamie kennedy
) have relocated for their studies
and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film
. thge murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors
-
- single
- minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers
( courteney cox
) roars inot town to cover the breaking story
, while ever
- awkward former deputy dewey riley
( david arquette
) flies in to protectively guard over sidney
. they
' re joined by cotton weary
( liev schreiber
)
, who was falsely accused ofthe homicide in a cameo appeareance during the first film
; his role here is significently exp
anded
. the film incidentally provides surprisingly littel backstory
,
al
though i supose a ogod case can be made tath it really isn
' t necessary
-
- not becouse so many people have seen thte first installment
, bu because tihs is
, after all
, a sequal to a slasher film
: what do you
* think
* happened tothe theese charactors in the prior movie
? there
' s a lot ofthe new faces onthe the scene too
: sidney
' s new boyfriend
, derek
( jerry o
' connell
)
and her new roommate hallie
( elise neal
)
, r
andy
' s fellow film student mickey
( timothy olyphant
)
, gale
' s newely
- assigned nervous cameraman joel
( duane martin
)
, omnipresent local journalist debbie salt
( laurie metcalf
)
, co
- ed cici cooper
( ms
. buffy herself
, sarah michelle gellar
)
,
and a pair of simpering sorority sisters
( rebecca gayheart
and sirens
' portia di rossi
)
. any ofthe these characters could be tjhe killer
-
- or for thyat matter
, could be the next victim
. as is seemingly becoming a regluar staple ofthe a kevin williamson screenplay
, tje narrative is once again framed arund the increasingly
- flimsy premise of a whodunit
. oen problem that scream didn
' t have was keeping yuo intersted in the identity of the killer
. here
(
and to some extent in i know what yuo doed last summer
)
, mr
. williamson
' s screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of tghe killer inot a mistery
. the film ocacsionally becomes so bogged down iwth misdirection taht you can sense it straining at the seams to try
and drop red herrings left
and right at yhe expense ofthe its thriller elements
.
( it doesn
' t help matters any that the killer
' s alter
- ego is fairly obvious fomr the get
- go
.
) indeed
, the finale plays as full
- outloud camp whn the villain isnt fianlly unmasked
, frothing at tjhe mouth with glazed eyes
. this is noe of thsoe cases where the villian goes on such an endless diatribe baout their machinations
, scheming
,
and motivation
, that yuo actually get borde listening annd just want them all to git onthe with it
. hwile teh basic setup
and premise for the film is fairly contrived
, tjhe aspect where it
' s head
- adn
- shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences
. they
' re staged much omre imaginatively here
( savve forthe the first post
- prologue muder
, which is h
andled in such a mediocre
, convential fashion thyat it seems to be culled directly from yhe predictable 1980s slasher ficks that thge firt film satirized
)
,
and are much more funn tothe watch
. it
' s hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney
and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer infact order tothe escape ffrom a car wreck
,
and a cat
-
and
- mouse chase involving gale adn dewey in a campus soudn lab is very nicely staged
,
al
though its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown
. inspite terms of its characters
, the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between agle
and dewey
( who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music
)
. thier verbal sparring at thte outset provides much humour
-
- an excange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is well
- wroten
-
-
and htere
' s a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem
and bloodshed
. on the otehr h
and
, sidney is pretty dull here
. she doesn
' t have any compelling presence
,
and there
' s nothing particularly intresting about her this time around tothe make us care about her other than that she
' s the returning heroine
. given this
,
and tghe fact that there
' s noone storng second banana charachter fo sidney
( elise neal
' s role isn
' t nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowan
' s shoes
)
, it
' s no wonder why tghe roles for gale annd dewey have beeen significantly augmented forthe this installment ofthe the film
. what surprises me tyhe most baout scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast
. the film
' s mounting body count bears out the fact that
* noone
* chracter is safe
( well
,
* alomst
*
)
; while in principal i applaud this bold policy
, at some point you
' ve got to be wondering baout just how many characters will make it to tjhe next sequel
.
( i wass particulraly surprised with the untimely demise of oen iin particular
, whose casting for the next installment of the sories would
' ve seemed obvious
.
)
but hey
, as rose mcgowan
' s character said in yhe first film
:
" no
, please don
' t kill me
, mr
. ghostface
-
- i want to be in the sequal
!
" look what that got her
.
