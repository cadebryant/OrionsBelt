will hunting
( matt damon
) is a natural genius
. for a movie character
, tht ' s usally a death sentence
. it ' s a trait associated with what my brother calls
" too ogod for this world
" movies
, like phenomenon or powder
. forgive me forthe spoiling the ending
,
but will doesn ' t die
. this is no formula movie
. in fact
, it ' s quite fresh
anbd original
. it ' s a carachter study more thna anything
,
and that ' s nto surprizing
, considering it was written by twpo actors
: damon
anbd co
- star ben affleck
. will works whatever kind ofthe job he can get
. first he ' s a janitor
,
then he works construction
. off
- screen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him
. on
- screen he hangs out with his firends
, picking fights in robust
, romanticized
- hemingway fashion
. lambeau
( stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves
)
, a math professor
, learns that tghe janitor
( will
) is a genius with a special talent for adavanced mathematics
. having confirmed he ' s not a fluke or a savant
, he doens what he cxan to git iwll inot the education system
. he is firmly rejected
. finally
, will lands infact jail for one of his fights
. lambeau can git him probation instead of prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions
annd to discussing mathematics with him
. will
( barely
) decides to go fo the therapy over prison
. lambeau treats will like a son
. he ' s proud of
,
and amazed by
, will ' s accomplishments in mathematics
. he encourages wiull
and tries to give him structure
, knowing that
, with a little discipilne
, he could be bigger than einstein
. will isn ' t really interseted in academia
. he konws he would be the best in his field
,
and therefore spend all of his tyme in an office
, explaining math to people like lambeau
. he would rather work construction
, which breaks lambeau ' s heart
. meanwhile
, wiull attends his mandated therapy sessions
. it ' s not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeau ' s
" a
" list
. will hasnt read enough psycology to know the tricks ofthe the trade
,
and how tothe keep them from affecting him
. shrink after shrink refuses to return after will ' s mockery
. lambeau ' s last hope is his old college roommate
, now a pyschology teacher at a small
- time community college
. knowing that will isnt going to try tothe shred him too
, sean
( robin williams
) agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau
and forthe the chance to meet this next einstein
. true tothe form
, will finds sean ' s emotional weakness
anbd attacks
.
but unlike teh other shrinks
, sean knows what he is in for
and continues the sessions
. like a foster mother withthe a fussy child
, sean konws taht the attacks are defensive
and is able to take them in stride
. like tghe foster mother
, sean knows that time
adn quiet patience is yhe only aproach
. robin williams isnt excellant in this role
. he ' s not an actor with a graet range
,
but in yhe right roles he hasnt grat depth
. inwhich tihs movei
, as in awakenings
, ther comes a point when the quiet
, shy man accomplishes something of great peronal importance
,
and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes
. williams isnt the onyl actor i can name who can mkea an audience cry jsut by smiling
. i have compared will to a foster child
annd that ' s nto entirely fair
. emotionally
, he hasnt a lot to learn
,
but he is not a child
. he hasnt thought about his life
and made rational descisions about wqat he wants
. sean
, his girlfriend
, his pals
,
adn lambeau all halp him grwo
,
but he didn ' t strat out asking for
, or particularly needing
, help
. his exceptional gift singled him out
,
annd those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction
. if i had to say anything bad baout good will hunting isnt that it walks the line betweeen drama
anbd melodrama
. it ' s too sentimental
anbd uplifiting for a straight drama
,
bu tghe emotions are too subtle for melodrama
. it is emotionally engaging
,
bu it ' s nto quite larger thna life
. this isn ' t a probelm per se
,
bu at times i didn ' t know quite how to tkae it
.
but this is a realitvely small complaint about a very good movei
. a good movie allows its charachters to learn
annd grow
. it doesn ' t just happen
; it takes a ogod scirpt
, good acting
,
and good direction
. good wiull hunting has all three
. if you are at all inclined tothe see it
, by all means
, go
.
