will hunting
( matt damon
) is a naturual genius
. fo a movie charactor
, that
' s usually a death sentence
. it
' s a trait associated with what my brother calls
" too good for this world
" movies
, like phenomonon or powder
. forgive me for spoiling thte ending
,
but wiull doesn
' t die
. this is no forumla movie
. in fact
, it
' s qutie fresh
and original
. it
' s a charater study mroe than anything
,
and that
' s not surprising
, concidering it was written by twpo actors
: damon
and co
- star ben affleck
. iwll works whatever kind of job he can git
. first he
' s a janitor
,
then he works construction
. off
- screen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him
. on
- screen he hangs outloud with his friends
, picking fights in robust
, romanticized
- hemingway fashion
. lambeau
( stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves
)
, a math professor
, learns that hte janitor
( will
) is a genius whith a special talent for adavanced mathematics
. having confirmed he
' s not a fluke or a savant
, he does what he can to get wiull into the eduction system
. he is firmly rejected
. finaly
, will l
ands in jail fo one of his fights
. lambeau can get him probation instead ofthe prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions
and to discusting mathematics with him
. will
( barely
) decides to go for the therapy over prison
. lambeau treats will like a son
. he
' s proud of
,
and amazed by
, wiull
' s accomplishments in mathematics
. he encourages iwll
and tries tothe give him structue
, knowing tht
, with a little discipline
, he sould be bigger tahn einstein
. iwll isn
' t really interested in academia
. he knows he would be tghe best in his field
,
and therefore spend all ofthe his time infact an office
, explaning math to people liek lambeau
. he would rather wokr consttruction
, which breaks lambeau
' s heart
. meanwhile
, iwll attends his m
andated therapy sessions
. it
' s not long befor he shreds all hte therapists on lambeau
' s
" a
" list
. will hasnt read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade
,
and how tothe keep them ffrom affecting him
. shrink after shrink refuses to return after will
' s mockery
. lambeau
' s last hope is his old coleeg roommate
, now a psychology teacher at a small
- tiome community college
. knowing that will is going to try to shred him too
, sean
( robin williams
) agrees to take him on as a favor tothe lambeau adn for the chance tothe meet this next einstein
. true to form
, will finds sean
' s emotional weakness
and attacks
.
but unlike the otehr shrinks
, sean knows what he is in for annd continues hte sessions
. like a foster mother with a fussy child
, sean knows thast the attacks are defencive
and is able tothe take them in stride
. like the foster mother
, sean knows that time anbd quiet patience is the onyl aproach
. robin williams is excellent in this role
. he
' s nto an actor with a great range
, bu in the right roles he has great depth
. in this movie
, as infact awakenings
, there comes a point when hte quiet
, shy man accomplishes something ofthe great personal importance
, annd a smile of pure joy spreads up tothe his eyes
. williams isnt the only actor i cin name who can make an audience cry just by smiling
. i haev compared will to a foster child
and that
' s nto entirely fair
. emotionally
, he hasnt a lot tothe leran
,
but he is not a child
. he hasnt
thought about his life anbd made rational decisions about what he wants
. sean
, his girlfriend
, his pals
,
and lambeau all halp him grow
,
but he didn
' t strat out asking for
, or particularly needing
, help
. his exceptional gift singled him out
,
and thsoe who love him kept pushing him in the right direction
. if i had to say anything bad about ogod wiull hunting is thgat it walks the line between drama
and melodrama
. it
' s too sentimental annd uplifiting for a straight drama
,
but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama
. it is emotionally engaging
,
but it
' s not quite larger than life
. this isn
' t a probelm per se
,
but at times i didn
' t know quite how tothe tkae it
.
but this is a relatively small complaint baout a veyr good movie
. a good movie allows its cahracters tothe learn
and grwo
. it doesn
' t just happen
; it takes a good script
, good acting
,
and good direction
. ogod will hunting has all three
. if you are at all inclined to see it
, by all means
, go
.
