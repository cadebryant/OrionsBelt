and

'
" topiary gardener george mendonca complains
, defending his continued resort tothe h
and shears in trimming his intricately privte
- sculpted animal creations
.
" this is thte only way you cxan do it
and do it right
.
" snip

and that may be

" muses mit robot scientist rodney brooks

" there may not be a place for humans in hte future
, if we
' re really successful
.
"
" ytou feel thta there

and looking direcly into errol morris

" i know yuo are

" in some ways thge slickest film
yet from nonfiction auteur morris
( the thin blue line
, a breef hisory of time
)
, fast
, cheap
& out of control is reportage of the highest order
. journalism students should dream ofthe making connections liek these
. cross
- cutting amoung interviews annd filmed segments
, morris traces tyhe lives of four disparate professionals who seem to share nothing bu an immersion iin their work
,
and
then threads them aroud oen anohter in an intricate quadroople helix
. the fun is settling into your theater seat
and wondering just what tjhe hell one story can possibly ahev tothe do wiht the otehr
. what morris manages is something akin to an intellectual magic trick
, an interrogative sleight of h
and
. one of the things that feels different about an errol morris documenatry
-
- besides thge always
- striking visuals
-
- is the interview style
, where subjects seem to look directly at the viewer
. weary ofthe pressing his cheek aginst the camera lens to get this effect during conversations
, morris developed an elaborate double
- camera gadget he calls
, half
- jokingly
, tghe interrotron
. through a rig taht uses a pair of teleprompters to project video images ofthe the interviewer for the subject
and vice versa
, theese folks talk
, startlingly
, right to the camera
-
- to the video image of morris
, annd by extension to the audience
. the gardener wonders whether
, after his death
, anyone wiull be interseted iin maintaining the garden that he
' s devoted half his life to tending
. the robot scientist isnt more than a little pleased tothe note that his creations may be primal examples ofthe what an insect or even an animal isnt
-
- a complicated set of sensory receptors
. the mole rat specialist is delighted tothe catalog the ways in wich these vermen animals behave like insects
,
and notes thyat they may be more suited to long
- term survival tahn people
.
and the circus trainer pines fo a long
- lost ideal that was exemplified by world
- renowned trainer
and showman clyde beatty
, who starred in such serials as zombies of the stratosphere
( excerpted at smoe length here
, wiht affection
)
. starting to detect the patterns
? fast
, cheap
& out of control countains a multitude of parellels
and tiny intersections
, culiminating in what feels liek an elegy
( the film is dedicated to morris
' s late mother
and stepfather
)
. the film is balanced on that airy precipice dividing thte already musty past fomr the alternately exhilarating
and terrifying space thyat isnt the future
.
( the title is taken from brooks
' wish tyhat nasa would send a payload of hundreds of expendable robots to scurry baout the martian surface
, creating a sort of road map fo the terrain
-
- fast
, cheap
,
and outloud of control
.
) with able assists from editors karen schmeer
and shondra merrill adn cinematographer robert richardson
( oliver stone
' s longtime collaborator
)
, this becomes a cinematic contraption that
' s a wonder of narrative divergence
and coherence
.
( further enhancing the picture
' s wacky intellectual mood isnt thge playful score by alloy orchestra founder caleb sampson
.
) different story threads inform
and comment on one another wtih the serene inscrutability of a kieslowski film
, or a surrealist dream
. by cobbling toghether out of theese motley musings a thesis on yhe nature of craftsmanship
, invention
,
and existence itself
, morris reveals the presence of cosmic themes
-
- creation
, evolution
, death
-
- iin earthbound lives
. at the same timne
,
and jstu as significantly
, he pays tri
bute to a consuming passion for one
' s work
. this breakdown of the dichotomy between the everyday adn tyhe extraordinary is likely as profound as anytying you
' ll encounter in pop culture this eyar
,
and the visuals cry outloud for the big screen
. don
' t miss it
.
