' frozen body

. evil
' s trip back into thte 60s
,
and uses his own time machine to take him back to 1967
, tothe try to save his mojo before fat bastard gets a hold of it
. once arriving infront the eyar 1967
, austin travels tothe his
" pad
"
, his smashing home
/ dance club
, where he meets felicity shagwell
, played by heather graham
, a cia agent who is willing tothe help him in his journey to stop dr
. evil
. as the film progresses
, hillarious one liners are thrown at us
, mainly by dr
. evil
, fo example
,
" don
' t go htere
, girlfriend
!
" tothe thte president ofthe thge united states
. many witty gags take place
, note thge entire tent scene
,
and just plain
, funny scenes which are so stupid
- they
' re funny come a dozen persay fifteen minutes
. tkae forthe example
, scott evil going onthe tje jerry springer show complaining baout how evil his father is
. the way austin powers
: tswsm uses its humor is clever
, throwing a hillarious scene at you
, followed by five minutes of one liners
, followed by another outrageous scene
, so yuo never stpo laughing
. there was honestly nto noe moment in austin powers
: tswsm where i wasn
' t laughing
. the last film that i laughed so hard iin
, was well
, austin powers
! it is apprent that mike myers knew how funny this film was while writing it
. the film even makse funn of itself in a line
, something along the lines of
,
" it
' s funny how engl
and
and sourthern california look nothing alike
.
" tswsm was filmed in southern california
,
but was supposed to take place in engl
and
. i can tell you one thnig
- he is having a lot ofthe fun with tihs enourmously popular character
, which is all over television
, newspapers
, magazines
, adn hte movie theaters
. i believe that dr
. evil got moreso attention in the tswsm than austin powers did
. dr
. evil provded more laughs
, more memorable moments
, anbd mroe interesting dialogue tahn austin did this tiome around
, who seems tothe missing tjhe funny touch thgat he had infact the first film
. i felt that austin really did hve his mojo tooked away
,
but fomr screenplay writer mike myers
, nto fat bastard
. also making a great addition to the series is mini me
, who isnt played by verne troyer
. even
though the midget ator isnt 30 eyasr ood
, he is adorable by dr
. evil
' s side constanly
. tjhe first austin powers film had barely any sentimental uqality
, such as lack of charachter development
, barely any detailed plot characteristics
, adn barely any ogod acting
,
but austin powers tswsm acutally shows some quality behind tyhe frequent humor
. mike myers
, with his three roles
, acts as eddie murphy did iin the nutty professor
, disguising himself completely in one ofthe tghe roles
.
( fat bastard
) all three characters are different
,
and mike myers doesnt do a good job h
andling earch one of them
. heather graham made a great addition with her talent to tswsm
,
and does a much better job than elizabeth hurley doed
, who gave a very flat performance inspite the original
, speaking her lines without any feeling or emotion
. speaking of hurley
, she can be seen in tswsm for a faw brief moments
. hopefully
, graham tags along for future austin powers adventures
. the bottom line
- a groovy sequel that mike myers put all of his mojo inot writing
.
