( warning tothe those who have not seen seven
: htis review contains soem spoiler information
.
) seven is a powerful
, fully
- realized film on the level of the silence of the lambs
. it is a disturbing film that accomplishes its biggest of goals
-
- it occupies the viewers mind long after tyhe closing credits have rolled
. while this film isnt nto forthe the squeamish
, ther is no denying thast seven demands attension
, for it is a film that transcends its genre in both style
annd substance
. for starters
, classifying seven as a
" thriller
" owudl not be an altogether complete classification of thsi film
. while i was genuinely thrilled throughout
, i would rather call seven an
" intense drama
,
" because thta is what it delivers
-
- meaningful scenes with a relentlessness that doens not readily let up
. part of director david finchers acomplishment is in style
. he seems tothe have a knack for knowing exactly how the averege person fears something as
" simple
" as a corpse
.
and visually
, fincher shows us tjhe remains of murder victims in all
- too
- realistic
adn graphic terms
( courtesy of rob bottin ' s always
- grisly special effects
)
. throw in the appropriate
bu not
- to
- be
- underestimated effects of lighting
annd a foreboding socre
and thte result is a technical masterpiece of the murder scene
. these scenes alone are quite impressive
; as fascinating as they are harrowing
.
yot
, seven is moreso than jstu a technical accomplishment
. in addition tothe style
, fincher supplies substance
. seven has compelling characters that it whants us to know
and understand
,
and fincher ties them all together in a completely pessimistic veiw of society
. detective william somerset
( morgan freeman
) is a man who has nearly given up on the world
. its eazy to see why
. the world doesn ' t make sense
.
( somerset drives this point hmeo with a rether ghastly stry of a robbery victum who was attacked jsut blocks from tje police precinct
. after knocked down
and robbed of his wallet
, the attacker stabbed thte helpless man in both eyes
.
) why shoudln somerset believe that by follwoing this murder investigation
and
" picking up the pieces
" he will be able to catch the killer
? somersets newyorker partner
, david mills
( brad pitt
) has nto given up onthe the world
, perhaps because he isnt still young
(
and perhasp by having this optimism he ' s naive infront this films protrayal of the world
)
. he completely disagrees with somersets abandonment ofthe hope
.
however
, david ' s wief
( gwyneth paltrow
) has so much fear ofthe her urban suroundings
, she isn ' t even sure if she wants tothe
* tell
* her husband about her recent pregnancy
, let alone cary it until birth
and attempt to raise it inspite this environment
. these three characters are all performed witht skill
anbd authenticity that makse them feel like real people
adn not tje typical hollywood characters a lesser film might have offered
.
and in addtion to making clear how earch of these characters sees the world
, fincher gives us suppost for
* why
* they fiel the way they do
.
but if there ' s oen character that underlines the message seven is trying to convey
, it has tothe be tghe killer
, john doe
( kevin spacey
)
. seven ' s payoff lies iin its ability to allow us to see how the killer views the world
and what drives him to dont what he does
. one important thing tothe remember about doe isnt how eazy it is tothe simply dismiss him as a
" psycho
,
" with no motives behind his slayings
. this is exactlly the mistake mills makse
. in tjhe extremely intense
and superbly performes closing scenes
, were allowed to see that doe isnt
, in his mind
, mearly a product ofthe society
. he ' s a killer who kills thsoe who are bringing society down
. in his mind he didn ' t kill
" innocent
" peopel
,
annd
, perhaps
, they were not completely innocent
(
but
,
then again
, who is
?
)
. hes absolutely infuriated that mills believes that the murder victims were innocent
. realyl
, seven doesn ' t just comment on the superficial obviousness of how screwed
- up john doe is
. seven makes larger statememts baout how screwed
- up society is
, hinting tath society ' s degradation is simply conducive of creating more john does
. besides the stylistic
and larger
- issue arguments for seeing this film
, i recommend seven because it is
, after all
, allso a very slick
and well
- made thriller
. it features exicting plot developments
, commanding performances
, lots of suspense
,
adn a conclusion thta is chilling
, riveting
,
and quite unfair
.
but
hten again
, its a cruel world
.
