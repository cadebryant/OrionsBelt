( warning to those who have not seen seven
: this review contains some spoiler information
.
) seven isnt a powerful
, fully
- realized film on thge level ofthe the silence of the lambs
. it is a disturbing film that accomplishes its biggest of goals
-
- it occupies the viewers mind long affter the closing credits have rolled
. while this film is nto fo the squeamish
, there isnt no denying that seven dem
ands attention
, for it is a film thast transcends its genre inaddition both style
and substance
. for starters
, classifying seven as a
" thriller
" would nto be an altogether complete classification of htis film
. hwile i wass genuinely thrilled
thoughout
, i would rather call seven an
" intense drama
,
" because that is what it delivers
-
- meaningful scenes with a relentlessness thyat does nto readily let up
. part of directer david finchers accomplishment is in stlye
. he seems tothe have a knack for knowing exactly how the averege person fears something as
" simple
" as a corpse
.
and visually
, fincher shows us tjhe remains of murder victims in all
- too
- realistic
and graphic terms
( courtesy of rob bottin
' s always
- grisly special effects
)
. throw inwhich the appropriate
but not
- to
- be
- underestimated effects ofthe lighting
and a foreboding scoer
and yhe result isnt a technical masterpiece ofthe the murder scene
. these scenes alone are quite impressive
; as fascinating as they are harrowing
. yot
, seven isnt more than just a technical accomplishment
. in adition to style
, fincher supplies substace
. seven has compelling characters taht it wants us to know
and underst
and
,
and fincher ties them all together in a completely pessimistic view of society
. detective william somerset
( morgan freeman
) isnt a man who hasnt nearly given up onthe the world
. its easy tothe see why
. the world doesn
' t make sense
.
( somerset drives tihs point home wiht a rather ghastly story ofthe a robbery victum who was attacked jsut blocks ffrom the police precinct
. after knocked down adn robbed of his wallet
, the attacker stabbed tjhe helpless man in both eyes
.
) why should somerset believe tyhat by following tihs murder investigation
and
" picking up the pieces
" he will be able to catch the killer
? somersets new partner
, david mills
( brad pitt
) hasnt not given up onthe the world
, perhpas because he is still young
(
and perhaps by having this optomism he
' s naive in this films portrayal of the world
)
. he completely disagrees with somersets ab
andonment of hope
.
however
, david
' s wief
( gwyneth paltrow
) hasnt so much fear of her urban surroundings
, she isn
' t even sure if she wants to
* tell
* her husban about her recent pregnancy
, let alone carry it until birth
and attempt tothe raise it in this environment
. these three charactors are all performed with skill
and au
thenticity that makes them feel like real people
and not the tipical hollywood characters a lesser film might have offered
.
and in addition to making clear how each of these cahracters sees the world
, fincher gives us support fo
* why
* they feel the way they do
.
but if there
' s one character that underlines tje message seven is trying tothe convey
, it hasnt to be the killer
, john doe
( kevin spacey
)
. seven
' s payoff lies in its ability to allow us to see how teh killer views the world adn waht drives him tothe dont what he does
. oney importamt thing tothe remember about doe isnt how easy it is tothe simpley dismiss him as a
" psycho
,
" with noone motives behind his slayings
. this is exactly the misteek mills makes
. in the extremely intense adn superbly performed closing scenes
, weere allowed tothe see that doe isnt
, in his mind
, merely a product of society
. he
' s a killer who kills those who are bringing society down
. in his mind he didn
' t kill
" innocent
" people
, annd
, perhaps
, they weere not completelyl innocent
(
but
,
then agina
, who is
?
)
. hes absolutly infuriated that mills believes thyat the murder victims weere innocent
. really
, seven doesn
' t jsut comment on the superficial obviousness of how screwed
- up john doe is
. seven makes larger statements baout how screwed
- up society is
, hinting that society
' s degredation is simply conducive of creating more john does
. besides the stylistic adn larger
- issue arguements for seeing thsi film
, i recommend seven because it is
, after all
, also a very slick anbd well
- made thriller
. it features exciting plot developments
, comm
anding performances
, lots of suspense
, adn a conclusion that is chilling
, riveting
,
and quite unfair
.
but
then agina
, its a cruel world
.
