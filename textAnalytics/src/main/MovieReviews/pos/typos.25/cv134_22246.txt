" stuart little
" is oen of hte best family films to come outloud this year
. it
' s a cute
, funny adn very good
- natured film that has nothing fo parents to squirm over except a few mild cusswords
.
though i read tje book a long time ago
and i relaly do not rember wqat it was about
, i do know that this film does not disappoint
. finally a movei gets released that is as good as the trailer makes it to be
, with a faw surprising twists
, some very funny moments
, adn a few sentimental moments all mixed in tothe one great littel movie
. stuart little is a mouse
. he has finally gotten a new home after being put up fo adoption
, he now lives with the littles
. a nice little
( no pun intended
) family that lives in theri apartment next to central park in newyorker york city
. they ahve a little boy george
( played by the adorable jonathan lipnicki
)
and now they have a newyorker son
. at first stuart takes a while
but he finally adjusts tothe being part of the family
and even getting along with the pet cat
. george doesn
' t take too well to having a mouse for a brother at firt
,
but once the twpo play toghether they instantly bond
. stuart
however is missing something
,
and he wants to know who his real parents are
. the littles try adn find his parents
and one day they show up on the doorstep wanting stuart back
. hesitating the littles know wqat
' s best for stuart anbd so does snowball the pet cat
, he
and his friends try to get stuart
but in the end we find out the truth baout stuart
' s past ending up to a sentimental
and very heart
- warming ending
. one thing i noticed baout the film instantly was the fantastic special effects
. just like in
" star wars
: epsiode 1
-
- the phantom menace
" stuart little
and his family are all computer generated
and they look fantastically rela
. ffrom thte detail of their fur
, to the detail of the way the walk
; the special effects team put a lot of time
and affort on this
$ 90 million dollar film
and it shows
. another movie that this has inthe common wiht is
" babe
" wiht it
' s talking animals
and people underst
anding them
. it has a familiy friendly atmosphere
and is never really scary or suspenseful enough to even scare the youngest of kids
. michael j
. fox does the voice of stuart himself
and just liuke in tyhe
" homeward bound
" movies does a fantastic job
and brings more out of stuart than anyone else could
. he tothe me fits the character perfectly
and ends up mkaing stuart even more lovable
. another gem ofthe the film is nathan lane as snowball
. when he ws timon in 1994
' s
" the lion king
" i would have sworn he was a comedian
,
and nowe infact
" stuart little
" he brings the most outloud of snowball adn makes him one of those characters we love to dislike
. for hte human actors geena davis who never gives a bad peformance does nto dissapoint here as well
. she fits nicely in her character
and there is a good chemistry between her annd hugh laurie who plays mr
. little
. both make us believe they are happily inwhich love
and married anbd jonathan lipnicki as their song is even mroe adorable thna he was inthe 1996
' s
" jerry maguire
"
. even
though stuart littel isnt completly cgi
, the human characters
and stuart have a nice chemistry together
and even makes us believe they really do care for each other
.
" stuart little
" is ideal family enteratinment for this holdiay season adn will nto disappoint youngsters or adults fo that marter
. we get entertainment
, laughs
, cries
and more fun at the movies this season than probably any other movie
. its nice tothe see a pg rated movie out at christmas thyat everyone can see
. even
though it has a
$ 90 millon dollar budget i
' m sure it will amking over that or just below it respectivly
. for all you parents out there trying tothe fidn a ogod family movie
, i have
yet to see bicentennial man as i write thsi bu as far as i nkow
" stuart little
"
and
" toy story 2
" are by far the best familiy films this yera
. a winner
.
