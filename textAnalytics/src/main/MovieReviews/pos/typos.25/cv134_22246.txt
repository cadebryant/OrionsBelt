" stuart little
" is noe of the best family films to come out this year
. it ' s a cute
, funny
and vyer good
- natured film that has nothing for parents tothe squirl over except a faw mild cusswords
.
though i read the book a long time ago
adn i really do nto remember whta it was about
, i do know that this film does nto disappoint
. finally a movie gets released that is as ogod as the trailer makes it to be
, with a few surprising twists
, some very funny moments
,
anbd a few sentimental moments all mixed in tothe one great little movei
. stuart littel is a mouse
. he hasnt finally gotten a new home after being put uv for adoption
, he now lives with the littles
. a nice little
( no pun intended
) familiy that lives in their apartment next to central park in new york city
. they have a littel boy george
( played by the adorable jonathan lipnicki
)
and now htey have a new son
. at first stuart takes a while
but he finally adjusts to being part of tjhe family
and even getting along with the pet cat
. george doesn ' t take too well to having a mouse fo a brother at first
,
but once the two play together they instantly bond
. stuart
however is missing something
,
and he wants to nkwo who his real parents are
. the littles try
and fidn his parents
adn one day tehy show up on the doorstep wanting stuart back
. hesitating the littles know what ' s best for stuart
and so does snowball hte pet cat
, he
and his friends try tothe get stuart
but in the end we find out the truth baout stuart ' s past endig up to a sentimental
and very heart
- warming ending
. noe thing i noticed about tyhe film instantly was the fantastic special effects
. jsut like in
" star wars
: episode 1
-
- the phantom menace
" stuart little
and his familiy are all cmoputer generated
and they look fantastically real
. ffrom the detail ofthe their fur
, to teh detail ofthe the way the walk
; thge special effects team put a lot ofthe time
and efort onthe htis
$ 90 million dollar film
and it shows
. another movie that this has in common with isnt
" babe
" with it ' s talking animals
and peple understanding them
. it has a family friendly athmosphere
annd is never really scary or suspenseful enough tothe even scare tjhe youngest of kids
. michael j
. fox doesnt thge voice of stuart himself
and just like in the
" homeward bound
" movies does a fantastic job
anbd brings more out of stuart tahn anyone else could
. he to me fits tyhe character perfectly
and ends up making stuart even moreso lovable
. another gem of the film is nathan lane as snowball
. wehn he was timon in 1994 ' s
" the lion king
" i would ahev sworn he wass a comedian
,
and now in
" stuart little
" he brings the most outloud of snowball
annd makes him one of thsoe cahracters we love to dislike
. for tyhe human actors geena davis who never gives a bad performance does nto disappoint here as well
. she fits nicely inthe her character
and htere isnt a good chemestry between her
and hugh laurie who plays mr
. little
. both make us believe they are happily in loev
and married
annd jonathan lipnicki as theri song is even more adorable than he was inwhich 1996 ' s
" jerry maguire
"
. even
though stuart little is completely cgi
, the human cahracters
and stuart hve a nice chemistry together
and even makes us believe htey really do care forthe each otehr
.
" stuart little
" is ideal family enteratinment forthe this holiday season
and will not disapait youngsters or adults for that matter
. we get entertainment
, laughs
, cries
anbd more funn at the movies this season than probably any other movei
. its nice to see a pg rated movei out at christmas that everyone can see
. even
though it hasnt a
$ 90 million dollar budget i ' m sure it will make over that or just below it respectivly
. fo all yuo parents outloud there trying to fidn a ogod family movie
, i have
yot to see bicentennial man as i write this
but as far as i know
" stuart little
"
and
" toy story 2
" are by far the best family films this year
. a winner
.
