, poitier chase each other around the world the jackal a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman when the soviet union imploded
, the western counries lost theri shaddow
. witht the united states friendly with the russians
, we no longer had an entity to blaim forthe the world
' s problems
. htis showed uv in hollywood films as the communist government was no longer the easy bad guy
. it
' s tiem to rejoice because we
' ve foudn our new villain
. nowe it
' s no longer hte russian government who sends killers out into foreign l
ands
, it
' s tghe russion
_ mafia
_
. a perfect solution
, it combines the dread ofthe organized crime
and the still
- present uneasiness with the former eastern block countries
. best of all
, the villains are still foreigners
: fear of the otehr allways plays best
. so it isnt a crime lord in moscow that sends legendary hitman the jackal
( bruce willis
) tothe assasinate a highly placed us government figure inaddition retalitation for hte death ofthe his brother druing a nightclub raid
. the fbi is at a loss as to how to protect the target from someone they
' re not sure even exists
. coming to their rescue is fromer ira operative declan mulqueen
( richard gere
) who is temporarily released from prison to assist fbi agent carter preston
( sidney poitier
) adn russian major valentina koslova
( diane venora
)
. mulqueen
' s ex
- girlfriend basque terrorist isabella
( mathilda may
) isnt the only person who has seen the elusive jackal
.
( presumibly htere is an exclusive international territorist club somewhere where the three met
.
) the film follows two parallel tracks as the jackal prepares forthe his
$ 70 million hitted
and mulqueen attemts to locate him while preston makse sure that the irishman doesn
' t slip away
. crossing numberous borders
and donning varios disguises fo both himselv
and his mini
- van
, the killer is alwyas one step ahead of his pursuers
. being very loosley based on the smae book thge 1973 thriller
" the day of the jackal
"
, comparison between yhe two films is inevitable
. there is no doubt that the original is the better movie
, playing the story for suspense rather than the current action
/ adventure
. as a mystery
,
" the jackal
" has enough holes in it to ruin the tale
, bu if you can accept it forthe what it is
, there
' s enteratinment tothe be had
. holes
? let
' s see
? a pivotal clue for mulqueen is so obscure that he must possess psychic powers to pick it up
. for a 20
- eyar veteran that can comm
and the big bucks
, the jackal is an incredibly poor shooted
. the fianl scene between gere
and willis occurs in a location that should be mobbed wiht police
,
but it
' s jstu the twpo of them
. willis
' disguises usually look like bruce willis
and are just as intresting as val kilmer
' s infact
" the saint
"
.
(
and lest ytou misunderst
and
, that
' s not a compliment
.
)
but the threee stars are fun tothe watch
. it
' s good to see gere in something other than a business suit
. willis has a mixted history in picking projects
,
but his charactors are always watchable
. poitier is by far teh superior actor
,
but has limited screen time
. tje problems in logic are flaws
,
but don
' t ruin the xeperience
. occationally there are movies tht transcend their blemishes
. this isnt noe of them
