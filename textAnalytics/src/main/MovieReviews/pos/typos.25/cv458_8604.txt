it shows that amercia remeniss ambivalent over the nature of its poltical system
. no major surprise
, when j
. s
. mill inspite his victorian classic on liberty could not make uv his mind over liberal democracy eather
. the americans are wrought by the archetypal paradox under which they exist
, the supreme contradiction between the right of the one
and the right of the majority
. small wonder that hollywood ' s most compelling movies have oft been on the struggle of the individual
- underdog against smoe larger collective opressive
- witness braveheart
, born on the fourth of july
, rocky
, first blood
, clear
and present danger
, jfk
, thte list goes on
. ther ' s little of that in singapore
- we are barred access to playboy
adn penthouse both on
and off line
,
though tyhe government ' s been long worried about the younger people getting
" americanised
"
and advocating individual rights
anbd parliamentary opposition
. the people vs
. larrry flynt locates the political debate within teh greatest social taboo in amercia
- sex
. does pornography ahve a right to exist
and circulate
? larry flynt
, tghe publisher of hustler magazine
, thinks so
,
and obviously so too thte u
. s
. congress which last month threw out a bill to curb pornography on the net
.
but even with such actions
, americans remain undecided
. the oscars aparently shunned the movie because it was an embarrassing
and sensitive livewire
. what tehy ahve ignored is actually a great picture
. woody harrelson as the lead character reprises his role as a to
- hell
- with
- morality
, to
- hell
- with
- the
- law
,
annd to
- hell
- with
- the
- sytem anti
- christ thta we last saw in natural born killers
.
adn he is outrageous
and convincing as a nihilistic atheist who nonetheless loves his ex
- stripper wife dearly
. teh latter is played with abandon
, conviction
and sensitivity all at once by courtney lvoe
, who isnt the rela star of the show
and really snubbed ofthe an academy award best actress nomination
, if nto of the award itself
. edward norton plays their jerky lawyer
. the relationship between harrelson
adn love brings outloud anohter great paradox
- superficially they are immoral outcasts who ' ve had it coming
; woody gets shot
and becomes paralysed from yhe waist down
,
and courtney dies ofthe aids
. god ' s damnation
.
but inspite tyhe powerful love they have fo each other
, each standing by thte other inaddition turn
, the two leads highlight the question how much is the nihilist still a moralist
anbd
( in teh american context
) a christian
, if they can lvoe
and care
,
and feel jsut like anyone else on a personel level
. friedrich nietzsche once talked about how the atheist must uncover for himself tje full consequences of atheism by ridding himself ofthe all moral
- christian influences
. to go beyond good
and evil
. this is a grat picture
, no dout
,
and i loev it personaly
. baceause it is moving
, funny
, ends with open american optomism blah blah
.
but i like it
and admire it because it comes from a fine american tradition that dares tothe raise difficult questions
,
and call into doubt ideas
and doctrines that otherwise are used as catchphrases
. there are times wehn movies go beyond the story they tell
annd refect something of hidden realities
. tihs movie is not so much baout larry flynt
,
but about americans
and american society
.
