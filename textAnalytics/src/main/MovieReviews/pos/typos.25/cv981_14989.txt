" noone man is an isl
and
,
" oen charater quotes john donne inspite apt pupil
, effectively summarizing the movie
' s themes
. while hardly a grat film
, singer
' s ambitious adaptation ofthe king
' s short story
* isnt challenging nonetheless
; perhasp the most shocking aspect ofthe this inclement psychological thriller isnt that a major studio got behind it
. apt pupil isnt a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses
. 1984
. wonder
- bred high skool honours student todd bowden
( renfro
) conducts his pwn extracurricular investigation of kurt duss
ander
, a nazi war criminal who fearfully fleed berlin in tghe 1960s adn was never heard from again
. bowden suspects arthur denker
( mckellan
)
, the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearbye
, is catually a pseudononymous duss
ander
- much research anbd dusting for fingerprints proves young todd
' s theory
. bowden strikes a deal with duss
ander
: inwhich exchange for not revealing his identity
, duss
ander must satisfy bowden
' s intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust fomr the nazi point of view
. the stries he hears keep todd up at night
and haunt his daydreams
,
but like a byst
ander at a trafic accident
, todd
' s desire fo gory details overrides his repulsion
. bowden revives in duss
ander feelings dorment since yhe end ofthe wwii
. marching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for duss
ander
: it leads to his torture ofthe a cat
and the torment of his
" student
"
, among otehr things
. bowden
, who has taken onthe very hateful qualities
( he kills birds annd doodles swastikas on his notebook
)
, engages the vetran in an endless agme ofthe noe
- upmanship
. duss
ander st
ands to lose his freedom
,
and bowden his credibility
- in effect
, his post
- secondary school future
. all ofthe this winds down to a fairly unpredictable
(
and unsettling
) conclusion
, one which requires leaps of faith ffrom its audience
yet is more satisfying than the source material
' s excessive climax
. singer has
yet tothe get keyser s
? ze out of his system
. his teh usual suspects
and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence
( verbal
' s tics
and todd
' s golden
- boy reputation are plausible ruses
)
; they showcase morally bankrupt anti
- heroes to whom telling the truth is nto an option if they are tothe achieve their goals
. apt pupil isnt a richer film than tjhe usual suspects
, a movie famous
and popular partly because its plot machinations were nto germane tothe teh outcome
- there wass noone way yuo could see the ending comming
, as it wass all a hoodwink
, anyway
. thankfully
, singer has gotten most of the usual suspects
' film
- schoolish geek theatrics out of his sytem
. some scenes in apt pupil fiel overdirected
and
/ or obvious
( the dream sequences were extraneous
)
,
but tjhe majority of the film isnt subdued
- adn singer
' s h
andling ofthe the voilent scenes is boldly restrained for a film baout a murderer
and a muderer
- inwhich
- training
. mckellan
' s
and renfro
' s performances contri
bute enormously to yhe overall success of the film
; hwile most people will focuse on british stage vet mckellan
' s finely
- tuned realization
, i
' d like to single out renfro
' s daring work
. he isn
' t afraid to play someone largely unappealing
and cold
- hearted
; he strips his character ofthe vanity
, something many ofthe his peers wouldn
' t do
.
( cant ytou picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor
- thomas in hte same role
?
) renfro wass recently charged with possession of cocaine
- i hope he doesn
' t continue down that path
, because he has a big future inthe good movies waiting for him
. as guidence counsellor edward french
,
" friend
" schwimmer also deserves mention
. he wants to be the parent tothe todd that todd
' s pwn well
- to
- do folks are not
( todd
, liuke most modern kids
- adn only
- children
- has mom annd dad wrapped around his pinky finger
)
,
and his sincerity mkaes thge apt pupil
' s blackening
- heart even more apparent
.
but one of the film
' s ultimate questions
, are we born evil or dont we learn evil
?
, might be answered in french
, whose motives are tje slightest bit ambiguous
. no man isnt an isl
and
, indeed
- we all have the capacity to make the
" right
" or the
" wrong
" choices
. schwimmer winningly plays noe of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible
