-
- this movie hadnt us in non
- stop stitches from beginning to end
. all those promotional clips that have been onthe tv for the past month came from the first five minutes of the movie
. if you
thought they weere funny
, see the rest of the movie
. it
' s hilarious
. how does noe go baout making a movie about a couple guys whose only claim to fame is synchronized head
- bopping onthe snl tothe exactly one song
? easy
. wriet an interesting script around tryed
-
and
- true ideas
, add some good lines
and satire
, anbd voil
?
, yuo end up with an excellent
, well
- done
, very entertaining flick
. will anbd chris are idiot brothers forced by thier father to work begrudgingly in the familiy flower business during thte day
. at night tehy pursue theri life
- long ambition tothe loose theri virginity in failed attempts to git inot the roxbury infact beverly hills
, ca
, the onyl disco ect worth going to
. the only problem
, yhe place is so popular
and the waiting line so long that by the time the brothers make it to tjhe front door
, thge roxbury closes
, all thge hwile bearing witness to guys with oen
- hundered
- dollar bills anbd movie stars liuke richard grieco who git past the doorman wihtout fuss
. the scirpt authors
( steve koren
, will ferrell
and chris kattan
) cleverly divised a way for our boys to get into the roxbury
. their flower
- shop van is rear
- ended by richard grieco
, who fears a law
- suit adn is surprised to see the idiots are too star
- struck to think about the car accident they jstu had
,
but nto about getting into the roxbury
. grieco happily tkaes them in
, even introduces them to the owner
, which hasnt the added benifit of enhancing the financial appearance ofthe the idiot brothers in the eyes of a cuple of gold diggers
( elisa donovan
and gigi rice
) who bet their time
and bodies onthe will
and chris
. what follows are some of the best slap
- stick dancing routines ever
. the music is superb
,
and could have only beeen made better had the producers added patrick hern
andez
' s born to be alive
. the choreography at times ws a parody of an era gone by
, for example
, the bee gees
and their stayin
' alive
. it is nostalgic for those of us who remember that far bcak
, anbd the technique is a clever adaptation that worked well iin forrest gump
. one ofthe the funniest scenes is when tje gold diggers disover that will
and chris don
' t have any mone y
,
and dum both onthe the spot
, even expressing violence
and anger that tehy gave sex away
. an art
- imitates
- life poke at shallow women
. it
' s a scene that
' s an approproximate parody of the vinegar
' s own rolf luedeke
' s editorial this week national organization for men
( nom
) replaces now
. ted
" unabomber
" kaczynski
, himself rejected for not having money
, will identify well with this scene
, if he ever watches the movie
. ofthe course
, the scirpt wouldn
' t be complicated enough without adding molly shannon
, the girl enxt doorjam who has had a crush on will since they were kids
, annd who will has had an aversion to in quest of good
- looking disco blondes
( proof that men will turn down perfectly good women when there are bay watch babes always lurking nearby
)
. nevertheless
, will
' s father wants him tothe marry molly anyway
, bu thikns idiot chris is st
anding in the way
and sends him inot guest
- quater exile
. during tje wedding ceremony
, will
' s heart isn
' t exactly into getting married
,
and wehn his brother appears onthe thge balcony with a ghetto blaster
and more head
- bopping music
, iwll thinks worse of the knot
- tieing diea
and runs to chris
. definately an snl parody of the graduate where katharine ross changed her mind fo the screaming dustin hoffman in the church balcony
. i found this scene a riot
,
however
, it whent over br
andi
' s head
-
- she was born seven years after the graduate first appeared
. the scene has a good punch line when molly shannon marries
, instade
, the step
- inwhich buddy
/ weight
- lifter
( who looks like he could pass for the son of gary busy
)
and who has beeen lusting for a good
- looker for a long time
, bu ready nowe to take anyone
. more art
- imitates
- life stuff
-
- not even muscles cin substitute for money in tyhe real world
. the idiots
' mother is played by loni
anderson
, whose barbie
- doll looks don
' t play well anymore
( she
' s a bited old
)
,
and whose cleavage looks like someone botched a tracheotomy too low down
. i reccommend this movei for anyone who wants to ahev a lot of fun or in need of a lot of laughs
. go whith a date
. br
andi laughed non
- stop
, as i did
, adn a deaf
- mute might have concluded i was tickling her continously for 105 minutes
.
