-
- thsi movie had us in non
- stop stitches from begining to end
. all those promotional clips that have been onthe tv for the past month cameback from hte first five minutes of the movei
. if you thought htey were funny
, see the rest of the movie
. it ' s hillarious
. how does one go about making a movei about a couple guys whose only claim to fame is synchronized head
- bopping on snl tothe exactly one song
? easy
. write an interesting script around tried
-
and
- true ideas
, add some good lines
and satire
,
and voil
?
, you end up with an exellent
, well
- done
, vyer entertaining flick
. will
and chris are idiat brothers forced by their father to work begrudgingly in the family flower busness during hte day
. at nigth htey pursue thier life
- long ambition to loose their virginity in failed attempts to git into the roxbury in beverly hills
, ca
, the only disco act worth going to
. thte only probelm
, the place is so populare
and the waiting line so long thgat by the time the brothers mkea it to the front doorjam
, the roxbury closes
, all the while bearing witness to guys with oney
- hundred
- dollar bills
and movie stars like richard grieco who git past the doorman without fuss
. the scirpt authors
( steve koren
, will ferrell
and chris kattan
) cleverly devised a way for our boys to git into the roxbury
. their flower
- shop van is rear
- ended by richard grieco
, who fears a law
- suit
and is surprised to see the idiots are too star
- struck tothe tihkn about the car accident they just had
,
bu not about getting into the roxbury
. grieco happily takes them in
, even introduces them tothe the owner
, whihc has hte added benefit of enhancing the finacial appearance ofthe the idiat brothers in the eyes of a cuple of gold diggers
( elisa donovan
and gigi rice
) who bet theri time
and bodies on will
and chris
. what follows are some ofthe tyhe best slap
- stick dancing routines ever
. the music isnt superb
,
and could have onyl been made better hadnt the producers added patrick hernandez ' s born to be alive
. the choreography at times was a parody of an era gone by
, for example
, the bee gees
and their stayin ' alive
. it is nostalgic fo thsoe of us who remember that far back
,
and the technique isnt a clever adaptation that worked well iin forest gump
. one ofthe the funniest scenes is when the gold diggers discover that will
and chris don ' t hvae any mone y
,
and dump both on the spot
, even expressing violence
adn anger thyat they gave sex away
. an art
- imitates
- life poke at shallow women
. it ' s a scene tyhat ' s an aproximate parody of the vinegar ' s own rolf luedeke ' s editorial this week national organization forthe men
( nom
) replaces now
. ted
" unabomber
" kaczynski
, himself rejected for not having money
, will identify well witht this scene
, if he ever watchs thte movie
. of course
, the script wouldn ' t be complicated enough wihtout adding molly shannon
, thge girl next door who has had a crush onthe will since they were kids
,
adn who will hasnt hadnt an aversion to infact quest of good
- looking disco blondes
( proof thgat men will turn down perfectly good womens wehn there are bay watch babes allways lurking nearby
)
. nevertheless
, iwll ' s father wants him to marry molly anyway
,
bu thinks idiat chris is standing in the way
and sends him into guest
- quarter exile
. during hte wedding ceremony
, will ' s heart isn ' t exactly into getting married
,
and whn his brother appears on the balcony with a ghetto blaster
and more head
- bopping music
, will thinks worse of the knot
- tieing idea
and runs tothe chris
. definitely an snl parody of the graduate where katharine ross changed her mind for yhe screaming dustin hoffman in the church balcony
. i found this scene a riot
,
however
, it whent over brandi ' s head
-
- she was born seven years after hte graduate first appeared
. the scene has a good punch line whn molly shannon marries
, instade
, the step
- in buddy
/ weight
- lifter
( who looks liuke he could pass for the son of gary busy
)
adn who hasnt beeen lusting for a good
- looker for a long tyme
,
but ready now to take anyone
. more art
- imitates
- life stuff
-
- nto even muscles cin substitute forthe money in the real world
. the idiots ' mother is played by loni anderson
, whose barbie
- doll looks don ' t play well anymore
( she ' s a bit old
)
,
and whose cleavage looks like someone botched a tracheotomy too low down
. i recommend this movie forthe anyone who wants tothe have a lot of funn or in need ofthe a lot of laughs
. go with a date
. brandi laughed non
- stop
, as i did
,
annd a deaf
- mute might have concluded i ws tickling her continuously forthe 105 minutes
.
