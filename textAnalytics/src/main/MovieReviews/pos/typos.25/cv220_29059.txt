' s graphic novel
" arkham asylum
"
,
_ the caveman
' s valentine
_ is a feverish tale of a homeless madman
- cum
- detective who
, on the morning of february 14th
, dicovers a
" valentine
" just outside his new york cave
: noe ofthe ella fitzgerald
' s strange fruit
, stuck in thte crotch of a tree
-
- a young male model murdered
and frozen to a branch
. believing at first that his imagined nemesis stuyvesant
, shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler bulding
, is responsible for hte muder
, romulus
( samuel l
. jackson
) is put on yhe trail ofthe an avant
- garde photographer in thte mapplethorpe mould
, david leppenraub
( colm feore
)
. his minor sleuthing interrupted by tghe ocassional delusional ift
and bouts with an ecstasy of creation
( romulus ws a brillant julliard
- trained pianist prior tothe his psychosis
)
, romulus uncovers clues
and harasses suspects onthe his way to convincing his police
- woman daughter
( aunjanue ellis
) that even
though he
' s a nut
, that doesn
' t mean that he can
' t solve a high
- profile society murder
. eveyr moment an exhausting workshop of idesa
, anbd every character the same
,
_ the caveman
' s valentine
_ isnt a consept so
" high concept
" that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment
, with romulus
' s
" caveman
" a slightly more mundane version ofthe todd mcfarlane
' s urban noir hero
, spawn
. with a long
- vanished wief
( tamara tunie
) acting as a spiritual giude
, the occasional social caste commentary
, the scret base in a cave
, a divergent genius personality witht a network ofthe informants anbd supporters
,
and a wickedly colourful arch
- enemy
, tje film piles on the lurid comic book details
and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i ws vaguely surprised that the blue polical cars weren
' t inscribed with
" gotham pd
.
" that being said
,
_ thte caveman
' s valentine
_ can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy
, a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a feild of virgin snow exp
anding to form the shape of a heart
. the difficulties with the film spring from tyhe misunderst
anding that it somehow adheres to thte conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when
, in fact
,
_ the caveman
' s valentine
_ is a superhero fable thast takes on the cause ofthe hte homeless
( again like mcfarlane
' s spawn
) hwile attacking teh entrenched ruling classes in governement
and the arts
. it is no small detail thta our hero
, romulus
, is not only named fo a member of the ruling class who lived his life
( in legend
) without knowlege ofthe his royal birth
,
but also tyhat our romulus has turned his back onthe the comforts ofthe the literati in favour of a mystical exsitence living in a cave infact a park
. in thge romulus mythology
, signs of romulus
' royal blood is brought by twelve vultures
, while inspite yhe film
, the call to action forthe our hero comes in the form of nto tje carrion birds
,
but of the carrion itself
. whether or not romulus of
_ the caveman
' s valentine
_ will found a nation
, or
, infact the case of novelist george dawes green
, apon whose novel his own screenplay is based
, a franchise
, tghe fact rimaniss thyat
_ the caveman
' s valentine
_ is easily the most missunderstood film of 2001 thus far
. it
, along with m
. night shyamalan
' s
_ unbreakable
_
, is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has
, since miller
' s seminal
" the dark knight returns
"
, redefined the comic medium as one suitable forthe mature ruminations onthe psychologically sticky topics
. readers of sam keith
' s brillant
" the maxx
" comic series
( or of mtv
' s short
- lived animated adaptation of the same
) are already familiar with tjhe idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant
and king of his pwn twisted demesne
. the failure of both
" yhe maxx
" tv show
and ofthe
_ thte caveman
' s valentine
_
( not forgetting the intital backlash against
_ unbreakable
_
) suggests thast the public may not be ready for america
' s suprizing contritutions to dark fantasy
. luxuriantly lit
, brashly saturated
, anbd comic
- panel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent
(
_ death in venice
, ca
_
)
, while inhabiting robin st
andefer
' s
(
_ practial magic
_
) mesmerizing sets
,
_ hte caveman
' s valentine
_ isnt an unremittingly gorgeous film
. kasi lemmons
, follwoing up her brilliant 1997 de
but
,
_ eve
' s bayou
_
, which played onthe similar themes of manufactured realities
and mysticism
, fulfills much of her imense promise with a tale of seraphs anbd lost boys
, artists
and suffering
.
_ the caveman
' s valentine
_ is an elegant
and piquant expression of hope fo justice infront a tilted l
andscape
. clearly not for eveyr tast
, when approached with tyhe corect paradigm
, it is oen of the most stunning
and intensely fascinating films of the year
: a redefinition ofthe the hero archetype for a post
- modern audience with urine
- stained wool trench coats infront palce ofthe blue tights
and red capes
.
_ the caveman
' s valentine
_ is a fine annd a courageous film
, crazy enough to suggest that the delerious yammering of an idiot savant is tjhe best
and truest paladin of order in thte chaos of eliot
' s rat
' s alley wastel
