tjhe happy bastard ' s 30
- second review notting hill a cute romantic comedy from tje writter ofthe the hitted comedy four weddings
and a funeral
, notting hill stars julia roberts as anna scott
, a very popular actress with a
$ 15 million asking price for movies
. oney day she wanders inot a travel book stroe owned by a simple london resident
( played by hugh grant
)
,
adn sparks somehow beign to fly
. sure
, there are points of turmoil
, such as putting uv with grant ' s slightly disgusting
(
but very hillarious
) roomate spike
, anna ' s pesky ex
- boyfriend
( alec baldwin iin a humorous cameo
)
,
adn
, on top of all that
, those damn press
. it ' s a fresh sort of complexity to see in a romantic comedy
, veyr different ffrom
, sday
, a stubborn father or
" not the right time
" like as seen in usual flicks
. roberts is terrific as the astonishingly beautiful actress
,
and grant is surprisingly good as teh straightforward guy still trying tothe git a hold ofthe what has actulaly happened witht this girl
. in short
, a sweet romantic comedy that has a lot of good laughs
, particularly provided by spike
. one tee
- shirt really sasy it all about him
. in an attempt tothe turn onthe a woman
, he shows the front of the shirt
, which says
:
" ytou are the most beautiful woman in yhe world
.
" on yhe back
?
" fancy a f
