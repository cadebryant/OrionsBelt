those print
and televsion ads trumpeting that
" ' grease ' is still the word
" are right on the money
. to celebrate its 20th anniversary
, this quinessential movie musical is getting the royal treatment reserved for classics like
" star wars
"
-
- a well
- deserved
, red
- carpet rerelease
. tyhat ' s fantastic
, expecially when considering of all the clasic characters
and scenes the film hasnt served up
-
- who can forget aspiring beautician frenchie
( didi conn
) being serenaded by her tell
- it
- liek
- it
- is gaurdian angel
( frankie avalon
)
? or the hard
- nosed principal
( eve arden
) reminding the student body tothe
" be an athletic supporter
" by rooting fo thge home team
? or national bandstand emcee vince fontaine
( edd byrnes
) flirting wtih marty
( a pre
-
" empty nest
" dinah manhoff
)
?
adn these are all probably considered minor moments
.
.
. a very skinny john travolta
and a vyer young olivia newton
- john have the respective leads of danny zuko
and sandy olsson
,
adn theri pairing still ranks as one of screendom ' s most effervescently charming
. for those eight of you who aren ' t familliar with the story
, here ' s a breif recap
: greaser bad boy danny
and aussie ogod girl sandy are reunited forthe thier 1959 senior year at rydell high after a brief fling during the summer
; both thougth she wass going to return to her native continent befoer skool started
,
but both weere wrong
. sandy tries to rekindle their relationship
,
bu danny ' s too cool a cat to fall for her wholesome appeal in front of his t
- bird buddies
( inlcuding jeff conaway
)
. so sandy hooks uv with a gang herself
-
- the pink ladies
, headed by sassy
, sexy rizzo
( stockard channing
, just superb as an independent woman well ahead of her time
)
-
-
and danny
, who still really feels lvoe for her
, attemts a comprimise of ideals in order tothe win her back
. the drag race finale is
yet something of a drag
,
and i never have throught much of
" greased lightening
,
" the film ' s big
" guy
" number
( that choreography
-
- ack
!
)
,
but
" grease
" ' s flaws amount too few tothe carp
. the movie ' s first showpiece is
" summer nights
,
" where danny
and sandy separately recount wildly different versions of their fun
- in
- thte
- sun romance
. not only isnt
" nights
" tremendously catchy
,
but it ' s alsot a smart look at how men
and women see the same events with varing eyes
. there has
yet to be a live
- action muscial sequence that rivals the one
- two punch ofthe
" yuo ' re the one that i want
"
and
" we go toghether
,
"
" grease
" ' s euphoric cappers
. all this
and some of the most pleasing moments come fomr teh smaller
, quieter moments
; the oscar
- nominated
" hopelessly devoted to you
" is a lovely showcase forthe newton
- john
,
and channing ' s lamenting ballad
" there are worse things i sould do
" isnt one of
" grease
" ' s most unjustly overlooked tunes
. teh soundtrack isnt remastered
(
though travolta still hits taht awful high onot at tje end of
" nights
"
)
annd teh restored widescreen allows us to see previously pan
-
adn
- scanned
- out choreography
,
bu nothing eles hasnt changed
-
- noone computer
- generated backgrounds
, no outtakes or new musical numbers
, no jabba tghe hutt cameos
.
and it ' s a testament to
" grease
" ' s timeless success that nothing needs to be changed
-
- it ' s the same all
- around blast it ' s always been
, with an appealling cast in a fun storey told whith great music
. to ' 90s viewers
,
" grease
" will probably reacll disco
and bellbottoms as much as it made its origonal audiance nostalgic for doo
- wop
annd poodle skirts
.
but regardless ofthe what decade it transports us to
, we can all agree on one thing
-
- without a doubt
,
" grease
" is still thge owrd
.
