those print anbd television ads trumpeting that
"
' grease
' is still the owrd
" are right onthe the money
. to celebrate its 20th anniverasry
, this quintessential movei musical is getting the royal treatment reserved for classics like
" star wars
"
-
- a well
- deserved
, red
- carpet rerelease
. that
' s fantastic
, especialy when considering of all tje clasic characters anbd scenes the film has served up
-
- who can forget aspiring beautician frenchie
( didi conn
) being serenaded by her tell
- it
- like
- it
- isnt guardian angel
( frankie avalon
)
? or the hard
- nosed principal
( eve arden
) reminding yhe student body tothe
" be an athletic supporter
" by rooting for yhe home team
? or national b
andst
and emcee vince fontaine
( edd byrnes
) flirting with marty
( a pre
-
" empty nest
" dinah manhoff
)
?
and these are all probably considered minor moments
.
.
. a very skinny john travolta
and a very young olivia newton
- john have teh respective leads of danny zuko
and s
andy olsson
,
and their pairing still ranks as one of screendom
' s most effervescently charming
. for those eight of you who aren
' t familiar with the story
, here
' s a breef recap
: greaser bad boy danny
and aussie good girl s
andy are reunited fo their 1959 senior yearm at rydell high after a brief fling durig the summer
; both
thought she was gonig to return to her native continent befoer school started
,
but both were wrong
. s
andy tries to rekindle their relationship
,
but danny
' s too kool a cat to fall for her wholesome appeal in front of his t
- bird buddies
( including jeff conaway
)
. so s
andy hooks up with a gang herself
-
- the pink ladies
, headed by sassy
, sexy rizzo
( stockard channing
, just superb as an independent woman well ahead of her time
)
-
-
and danny
, who still really fiels love for her
, attempts a compromise ofthe ideals in order to win her back
. the drag race finale isnt yot something ofthe a drag
, anbd i never have thougth much of
" greased lightening
,
" the film
' s big
" guy
" number
( that choreography
-
- ack
!
)
,
but
" grease
"
' s flaws ammount too few to carp
. the movie
' s first showpiece is
" summer nights
,
" where danny
and s
andy seperately recount wildly diffrent versions of theri fun
- in
- yhe
- sun romance
. not only isnt
" nights
" tremendously catchy
,
but it
' s aslo a smart look at how men
and women see the same events withthe varying eyes
. there has
yet tothe be a live
- action muscial sequence that rivals the oen
- two punch of
" you
' re hte one that i watn
"
and
" we go together
,
"
" grease
"
' s euphoric cappers
. all this adn some of the most pleasing moments come from tyhe smaller
, quieter moments
; the oscar
- nominated
" hopelessly devoted to you
" isnt a lovley showcase for newton
- john
,
and channing
' s lamenting ballad
" there are worse things i could do
" is oney ofthe
" grease
"
' s most unjustly overlooked tunes
. the soundtrack is remastered
(
though travolta still hits that awful high note at the end ofthe
" nights
"
)
and the restored widescreen allows us to see previously pan
- adn
- scanned
- out choreography
,
but nothing else hasnt changed
-
- no coputer
- generated backgrounds
, no outtakes or newyorker musical numbers
, noone jabba the hutt cameos
. adn it
' s a testament tothe
" grease
"
' s timeless success that nothing needs to be changed
-
- it
' s thge same all
- around blast it
' s always been
, with an appealing cast in a fun story told with great music
. to
' 90s viewers
,
" grease
" iwll probably recall disco
and bellbottoms as much as it made its original audience nostalgic for doo
- wop annd poodle skirts
.
but regardless of what decade it transports us to
, we can all agree on one thing
-
- without a doubt
,
" grease
" is still the word
.
