' thrid film
, after dumb anbd dumber
( 7
. 5
/ 10
) anbd kingpin
( 8
/ 10
)
, brings together the real
- life couple of cameron diaz
and matt dillon
, soem nasty humour
, a cute dog
, adn a mix of love
, fate
and romance
. plot
: high
- school nerd ted gets lucky whn thge cutest girl inwhich his class asks him tothe tje prom
. unfortunately for ted
, he accidentally gets a part of his male anatomy
( ouch
!
) caught in his zipper
,
and misses the big night
. thirteen years later
, ted still can
' t get mary out of his mind
,
and hires a private detective
( dillon
) to find her
. once found
, it turns outloud tyhat mary has more thna oney suitor
,
and thgat
' s when the real fun begins
. critique
: likeable comedy with a few extremely funny scenes
, some funny looking peple
,
and a plot thyat won
' t ever put you to sleep
. having said that
, i must admited thgat i did like the farrellys
' two previvous films moreso thna this noe
,
but that is saying a lot
, since i really did love those earlier pics
. this one is also quite funny
,
but it didn
' t really blow me away like the others
.
then again
, maybe my expectations were too high
.
then again
, mabey i should shut up
, anbd write a littel more about thte film
,
and less about my supposed subconscious reasons for liking
/ disliking the film
. continuing where their other pictures left off
, tghe farrellys
' create a cutesy world of people wih strange anbd endearing qualities
,
and a simple plot by whic to tye them all together
. this one also includes plenty of toilet humour
, bu also some borderline fun
- making of tje disabled
and menally
- challenged
. i must admit that i really wasn
' t sure whether tothe laff at some points or not
. not a ogod palce to be
. having said that
, tje scenes taht did tear through the audience
, anbd yours truly
, were extremely hillarious
,
and went on for several minutes aftter tghe punchline
. the laughter practicaly killed out thge next scene for one of the best ones in the movie
( something to do whith hair gel
)
. on the negative end
, i did nto like the musical interludes of jonathan richman that ran through the entire picture
. i found them quite useless
, unfunny annd distracting
. also
, i found that a lot of the funnier scenes had aready beeen shown in the film
' s trailer
.
and ofthe course
, i never quite buy hte fact that these beautiful
, inteligent
, single women still can
' t seem to find the
" right guy
"
( see kiss hte girls
( 7
/ 10
)
. i doed really like all of tje actors in the film
, especialy ben stiller
, who appears to be solidifying his mark as a graet comical actor withthe this picture
and one of my favourites from 1996
, flirting with disaster
( 8
/ 10
)
. i also liked matt dillon with his big teeth
, adn lee evans with his superb faux
- simapthy british accent
. funny stuff
. aslo
, make sure thyat you stay for the credits
, because there isnt an entire montage of outtakes from the film thgat plays under a lip
- synched version of
" build me uv
buttercup
