the farrelly brothers ' third film
, after dumb
and dumber
( 7
. 5
/ 10
)
adn kingpin
( 8
/ 10
)
, brings together the real
- life cuple of cameron diaz
and matt dillon
, some nasty humour
, a cute dog
,
and a mix of love
, fate
and romance
. plot
: high
- school nerd ted gets lucky when tyhe cutest girl in his clas asks him to the prom
. unfortunately for ted
, he accidentally gets a part of his male anatomy
( ouch
!
) caught in his zipper
,
and misses tyhe big night
. thirteen years later
, ted still can ' t git mary out of his mind
,
adn hires a private detective
( dillon
) to find her
. once found
, it turns out tath mary has more than one suitor
,
and that ' s when the real fun begins
. critique
: likeable comedy with a few extemely funny scenes
, some funny looking peple
,
and a plot that won ' t ever put you to sleep
. having said that
, i must admit thyat i doed like tje farrellys ' two previous films more than htis one
,
bu that is saying a lot
, since i really did love thsoe earlier pics
. this one is alsot quite funny
,
bu it didn ' t really blow me away like the others
.
then again
, maybe my expectations were too high
.
then again
, maybe i shouldnt shut up
,
and wriet a little mroe baout the film
,
and less about my supposed subconscious reasons for liking
/ disliking the film
. continuing where their otehr picturesk left off
, the farrellys ' create a cutesy world of people with strange
and endearing qualities
,
and a simple plot by which to tie them all together
. this one also includes plenty of toilet humour
,
but aslo soem borderline fun
- making ofthe the disabled
and mentally
- challenged
. i must admit that i really wasn ' t sure whether tothe laugh at some points or not
. not a good palce tothe be
. having said that
, the scenes that did tear through tghe audience
,
and yours truly
, were extremely hilarious
,
and went on for several minutes after the punchline
. the laughter practically killed outloud the enxt scene for noe of tjhe best ones infront the movei
( something tothe do with hair gel
)
. on the negitive end
, i did nto like hte musical interludes of jonathan richman thta ran through thte entire picture
. i found them qtuie useless
, unfunny
annd distracting
. also
, i foudn that a lot of the funnier scenes hadnt already beeen shown infront the film ' s trailer
.
anbd of course
, i never qtuie buy the fact that these beautiful
, intelligent
, single women still can ' t seem tothe find the
" right guy
"
( see kiss the girls
( 7
/ 10
)
. i doed really like all of the actors in the film
, especially ben stiller
, who appears to be solidifying his mark as a great comical actor with this picture
anbd one of my favourites from 1996
, flirting wtih disaster
( 8
/ 10
)
. i also liekd matt dillon wtih his big teeth
,
and lee evans with his superb faux
- sympathy british accent
. funny stuff
. also
, make sure thta you stay for the credits
, because there is an entire montage of outtakes from the film that plays under a lip
- synched version ofthe
" build me up buttercup
"
, whitch isnt raelly kool
. overall
, a cute comedy with a decent premise
,
and a few particularly hilarious scenes
. little known facts
: the farrellys big break cameback when they somehow got a copy of their script
" dust to dust
" into the hands of eddie murphy via
? murphy ' s neighbour
. they onyl found out baout murphy ' s interest
, when they saw eddie mention the scirpt on the david letterman sohw one night
. matt dillon is a high skool dropout
. in between acting gigs
, dillon hasnt branched out into tghe restaurant business
. close tothe hmeo in his native newyorker york

and a swanky uptown eatery called the falls
