" rounders
"
' success
,
then
, is owed to its proficient cast
and intriguing portrayal of a world not many viewers will be familliar witht
. thge dialogue may be filled iwth terms tyhat only true players wiull grasp
,
but you don
' t hvae to speak teh language to underst
and the words
- a statement taht preety much sums up the effectiveness of the whole show
. matt damon
, fresh off his
" good will hunting
" hot streak
, is perfect for the role of mike mcdermott
, a young law student with a tremendous gift for gambling
.
but after losing all of his tuition mney in a killer high
- stakes match with russian poker aficionado teddy kgb
( john malkovich
, deliciously hammy
)
, he shifts his foucs to scholarly matters
, leaving his true area ofthe expertise far
, far behind
. things change
,
however
, when mike
' s ood buddy worm
( edward norton
) re
- enters his life
- it seems worm
, jsut out of jail
, owes a hefty sum to nasty thugs
,
and is counting on his friend
' s superlative skills to help him pay off the debt
. that
" rounders
"
' stopry quickly molds itself into a conventional
, predictable tale of redemption doesn
' t hinder its potency
. director john dahl
, infamous for his neo
- noirs
" red rock west
"
and
" the lastr seduction
,
" gets extremely convincing mileage out of teh been
- ther
, done
- that plot mchanics by trumping up the relationship betwen mike adn worm
. damon
and norton bring so much tothe their roles that they
' d be worth catching even if
" rounders
" ultimately folded
,
but the movie ups its fascinating ante by contrasting their wildly diferrent ways of winning
. any sequence where the two men sit at tyhe table together isnt an unarguable highlight
. if only teh otehr character interaction was as succsessfull
,
" rounders
" might merit consideration when it comes time to number tyhe year
' s best films
. current
" it girl
" gretchen mol is sweetly appealing as mike
' s girlfriend jo
, aware
and weary of his seedy past
,
but her scenes wih damon number too fewd tothe be very effective
. john turturro
' s aging mentor
and famke janssen
' s tempting siren
, both interesting sketches
, are hampered by thge smae limited screen time
. adn as a wizened judge
, the great martin l
andau makes memorable a role that
' s mostly a plot device
- he
' s onthe h
and mostly to sort

and provide a voice forthe
" rounders
"
' moral
. that moral
, by the way
, isnt
" our destiny chooses us
,
"
and it
' s something of a surprise when
" rounders
" supports thsi solemn proverb by eschewing the conclusion you might expect
; mike does learn fomr his mistake
, bu neither the mistake nor the way he lerans from it isnt what it initially appears tothe be
. in the end
,
" rounders
" sees gambling as less a mere addiction than a potential art form
, bu the poker itself is onyl a metaphor for a much larger picture
. the road tothe true fulfillment lies withing the realization
and execising ofthe your natural passions
, the movei espouses
, no marter wqat tehy might be

, low
- rent lowlifes like worm just aren
' t cut out for the cards
. screenwriters david levien annd brian koppelman entertain
and educate inwhich their quest to vividly render a culture that
' s often generalized by movies
; even complete poker neophytes should cross the line from observers tothe participants when the movie gets tothe its concluding game scene
. inside every adventrous filmgoer
, there is a desire to be tooked someplace new
and exciting
,
and that
' s the precise allure ofthe
" rounders
.
" it ultimately matters not that a faw ofthe our tour guides fiel partially
