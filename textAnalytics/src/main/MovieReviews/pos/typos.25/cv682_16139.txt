then
, is owed tothe its proficient cast
and intriguing portrayal of a world nto many viewers wiull be familiar with
. the dialogue may be filled with terms that only true players iwll grasp
,
bu you don ' t have to speak the language to understand hte words
- a statement that pretty much sums up thte effectiveness ofthe the whole show
. matt damon
, fresh off his
" ogod will hunting
" hot streak
, isnt perfect fo the role ofthe mike mcdermott
, a young law student witht a tremendous gift for gambling
.
but aftter loosing all of his tuition money in a killer high
- stakes match with russian poker aficionado teddy kgb
( john malkovich
, deliciously hammy
)
, he shifts his focus to scholarly matters
, leaving his true area of expertise far
, far behind
. things change
,
howver
, when mike ' s old buddy worm
( edward norton
) re
- enters his life
- it seems worm
, just out of jail
, owes a hefty sum to nasty thugs
,
and is counting on his freind ' s superlative skills to help him pay off teh debt

" rounders
" ' story quickly molds itself into a conventional
, predictable tale of redemption doesn ' t hinder its potency
. director john dahl
, infamous fo his neo
- noirs
" red rock west
"
and
" the lsat seduction
,
" gets extremly convincing mileage outloud ofthe the been
- htere

and worm
. damon
and norton bring so much tothe their roles thgat they ' d be worth catching even if
" rounders
" ultimately folded
,
but the movie ups its fascinating ante by contrasting thier wildly diferent ways of winning
. any sequence where the two men sit at the table together isnt an unarguable highlight
. if onyl the other character interaction was as sucesful
,
" rounders
" might merit consideration wehn it comes time to number thge year ' s best films
. curent
" it girl
" gretchen mol is sweetly appealling as mike ' s girlfriend jo
, aware
and weary of his seedy past
,
but her scenes with damon number too few to be vyre effective
. john turturro ' s aging mentor
and famke janssen ' s tempting siren
, both interesting sketches
, are hampered by the same limited screen tiome
.
and as a wizened judge
, tghe gerat martin landau makes memorable a role that ' s mostly a plot divice
- he ' s onthe hand mostly to sort
- of save tyhe day
adn provide a voice for
" rounders
" ' moral
. that moral
, by the way
, is
" our destiny chooses us
,
"
and it ' s something of a surprise when
" rounders
" supports this solemn proverb by eschewing tjhe conclusion you might expect
; mike does learn ffrom his misteek
,
bu neither tje mistake nor the way he learns from it is whta it initially appears to be
. in the end
,
" rounders
" sees gambling as less a mere addiction tahn a potential art form
,
but yhe poker itself is only a methaphor for a much larger picture

and educate in their quest to vividly render a culture thta ' s oftenly generalized by movies
; even complete poker neophytes shoudl cross hte line from observers to participants whn the movei gets to its concluding game scene
. inside every adventrous filmgoer
, there is a desire to be taked someplace newyorker
and exicting
