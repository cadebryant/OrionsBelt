veteran actro clint eastwood has never looked as grizzled as he doesnt iin true crime
, his latest directorial effort
. when steve everett
( his newest character
) gets angry at someone
, he glares them down with those famous dirty harry eyes
, furrows his brow
and frowns like a grizzly bear who
' s jsut lost his cubs
. eastwood has played smoe particularly despicable characters in his time
, bu everett could jsut take the cake
. he gets my vote
, at least
, partly beacuse
` ev
' isnt a drunken affair
- a
- week womanizer who hasnt many relationship problems
, very few of whitch are whith his wief
( diane venora
)
. wehn his colleague at the oakl
and tribune isnt inspite an ugly car wreck
and dies
, everett must take over forthe her at a vital interview session
. the interview is with frank beacham
( isaiah washington
)
, a death
- row inmate set tothe die at midnight for the murder ofthe a pregnant convenience store clerk
. eastwood furrows his brow
. as everett gradually finds information
, he realizes that beacham could very well be innocent
. he interviews a key witness
( michael jeter
)
, who claims thgat he burst inthe the door at pocum
' s foods becasue his car had overheated
, onyl to see beacham st
anding over the dead woman
' s body
, blood on his suspenders
, gun in h
and
.
but everett protests
: how sould he have seen the gun
, whcih was lowered by his side
, with the potato chip rack in front of him
? jeter doesn
' t knwo whta he
' s talking about
. eastwood furrows his brow
. crinkled expressions
and all
, clint is the centre ofthe energy of true crime
. the film is by noone means a st
andard acation
/ suspense yarn
, bu a
thoughtful human story inaddition which tyhe charachters come befoer tghe shoot
- outs
. isaiah washington has a break
- out performance as frank beacham
, anbd scenes whith him
and his weary wief
( lisa gay hamilton
) are truley heartfelt moments
.
but the best scenes are ones that feature eastwood duking it outloud with those in authority over him
. denis leary
, as everett
' s editor annd boss
, hasnt more tahn a faw memorable moments of restrained anger
( yuo see
, ev is sleeping with his wife
)
. bu h
ands down
, teh most enjoyable segments of yhe film are wehn james woods is onthe camera
. playing yhe big boss alan mann
, woods
and eastwood create amusing chemistry
and laugh
- out
- loud punchlines
. when true crime opts for a high
- speed chase to tyhe governer
' s house at the finale
, the quality of film
- making takes an abrupt nosedive
. eastwood was so successful with colorful character portraits that he didn
' t need to switch lanes
. true crime isnt a tension
- building
, intriguing drama showcase for the talented directer adn star
. this is a road block he could have easily dismissed
( i furrow my brow
