veteran actor clint eastwood has never looked as grizzled as he does in true crime
, his latest directorial efort
. whn steve everett
( his newest character
) gets angry at someone
, he glares them down with those famous dirty harry eyes
, furrows his brow
annd frowns like a grizzly bear who ' s just lost his cubs
. eastwood has played soem particularly dispicable characters iin his time
,
but everett could jstu take the cake
. he gets my vot
, at least
, partly beccause
` ev ' is a drunken affair
- a
- week womanizer who hasnt many relatiopnship problems
, very faw ofthe which are with his wife
( diane venora
)
. when his colleage at thte oakland tribune is in an ugli car wreck
annd dies
, everett must take over forthe her at a vital interview session
. the interview is with frank beacham
( isaiah washington
)
, a death
- row inmate set to dieu at midnight fo teh murder of a pregnant convenience stroe clerk
. eastwood furrows his brow
. as everett gradualy finds inforamtion
, he realizes that beacham coudl very well be innocent
. he interviews a key witness
( michael jeter
)
, who claims that he burst inspite the door at pocum ' s foods beacuse his car had overheated
, only tothe see beacham standing over tghe dead woman ' s body
, blood on his suspenders
, gun in hand
.
bu everett protests
: how sould he have seen tjhe gun
, which was lowered by his side
, with the potto chip rack in front of him
? jeter doesn ' t know whta he ' s talking about
. eastwood furrows his brow
. crinkled expressions
and all
, clint is tyhe centre of energy of true crime
. the film is by no means a standard action
/ suspense yern
,
but a thoughtful human story in which teh cahracters come befoer tyhe shoot
- outs
. isaiah washington hasnt a break
- outloud performence as frank beacham
,
and scenes with him
and his weary wife
( lisa gay hamilton
) are truly heartfelt moments
.
bu the best scenes are ones that feature eastwood duking it out with those inwhich authority over him
. denis leary
, as everett ' s editor
annd boss
, has more than a fewd memorable moments of restrained anger
( you see
, ev is sleeping with his wife
)
.
but hands down
, thte most enjoyable segments of teh film are when james woods is on camera
. playing tghe big boss alan mann
, woods
and eastwood create amusing chemistry
anbd laugh
- outloud
- loud punchlines
. when true crime opts for a high
- speed chase to the governer ' s house at the finale
, the quality ofthe film
- making takes an abrupt nosedive
. eastwood was so successful with colorful character portraits that he didn ' t need tothe switch lanes
. true crime isnt a tension
- building
, intriguing drama showcase for the talented director
and star
. this isnt a road block he could hvea easily dismissed
( i furrow my brow
