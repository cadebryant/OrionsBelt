showgirls is the second major outing fo the prodcution team ofthe pual verhoeven
, directer
,
and joe eszterhas
, writer
. their last affort
, basic instinct
, played liuke the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock
, with a dash of raw sex
and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry
- spiced tabasco sauce
; a dish not to everyone
' s taste
, bu certainly a well
- crafted movie
. possibly thyat movie
' s greatest strength was that the most importan events happended offstage
, prior to the movei
, durring thte movei
, anbd after the movie
.
.
. annd that
, after bringing all the plotlines toghether neatly
, it left the viewer with full knowledge of waht
* would
* happen in tghe cahracters
' future
, so there wass noone need to film it
. there ws actually about four hours
' worth of screen story there
, bu eszterhas found ways tothe git it all on
- screen inwhich twpo
, by leading his audience into analyzing what ws really going on
; anbd by still holding their interest with clever misdirection annd false trails
. the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present inthe showgirls
. we have attractive
, sympathetic
,
but still highly repellent characters
; we hvae shows for the eyes
and the ears
, plotlines that play on several levels
, we have beautifuly delineated cahracters who are drawn fomr life
and very believable
,
and we have a story ofthe an innocent
( who may not be so innocent
) who
' s trying to play straight
, trying to improve her station in life
, who slips into behaving the way those around her do
.
.
.
but recovers with a flourish
, anbd quits a winner
. in this sense
, thte movie isnt a bit of a departure for verhoeven
, who
' s not known for treating his characters well
;
but nomi
, tje part played by elizabeth berkley
, definitely opts outloud of the game in a positive way
, adn we
' re left feeling good baout her future
. this is not one of the great movies
,
but it
' s far better than we
' d beeen led to expect by all the negative pre
- release publicity
. verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971
,
and in the last quarter
- century has pushed farther annd farther
, experimenting with the socially
- acceptable limits to movie
- making
. his most reccent three movies
, robocop
, total recall
, annd basic instinct
, have been a progression ofthe back
- door access to american culture
, moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives
;
and now he
' s exploring the sleeze
. this movei may be hte frist movie ever made forthe which tje director
' s contract contained a spicific provision taht he would not hvae to deliver an r rated movie
.
( verhoeven had to cut several parts ofthe basic instinct to get an r rating
,
al
though his original verzion is availiable on video
.
) many reviewers have tooked the politically
- correct stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery isnt a bad thing
;
but they miss tghe fact that thsi movie is not about naked ladies
, it
' s baout people in an enviroment where naked ladies are common
,
and why such an environment should exist
. it
' s about teh scum who uise other people as power
- trip toys
,
and tje ened to escape their pwoer
. it
' s about a world where sex isnt nothing
and normal human values don
' t pertain
;
and the lack of sexual excitement adn passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an acomplishment
. an nc
- 17 movie which isn
' t sexually exciting says a great deal about tghe phoniness anbd emptiness ofthe a social stratum where sex has beeen robbed ofthe any kind of beauty
, pwoer
, or value
. the one scene in tghe movie that
* sould
* hvea been a ogod sex scene
, berkley
and maclachlan in a swimming pool
, is not exciting
, because by
then we already know his carachter is a callous manipulator
. if anything
, it
' s a rape scene with a victum who
' s been duped into cooperation
. ytou don
' t make a movei about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors
; you don
' t make a movie about world war ii wihtout a fewd guns going off
and a few people getting killed
;
and you don
' t make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls
.
.
.
and in an awful lot ofthe vegas shows
, an awful lot ofthe ladies wear very little clothing
. thsi is a legitimate portrayal of a rether seamy side ofthe yhe entertainment industry
, inthe a town where sex isnt simply a negotiable commodity
. showgirls de
- glamorizes tje las vegas sohw
and sex industries wih great effectiveness
. nomi is plyed
, infact a very ogod performance
, by elizabeth berkley
, who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents who
' s at teh end of her rope
, desparate to live a life better than thte one she
' s known
. she has nothing to market exept her body
and her limited dancing ability
,
and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker
, trying tothe be something better than she seems destined to be
. whn nomi realizes she
' s gone too far fo too little
, she catches herself jstu infact timne tothe save the most essential part ofthe who she wants to be
. gina rivera plays molly
, a dressmaker
and costumer who befriends nomi
, providing her with what may be the oen solid
, positive relationship in nomi
' s entire life
. molly is the noe who makes the diference
,
and provides the role model
and framework nomi needs to verify thte value system she
' ll be using fo the rest of her life
,
and nomi
' s feelings fo molly are the spur that forces nomi
' s decision
. gina gershon plays cristal
, an aging
, bu still very attractive starring dancer
, a reflexively competive manipulator who
' s become a villainess by internalizing thte ethose ofthe the crooks
and scum around her
. gershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner
and raquel welch
; a fading talent made bitter by self
- awareness
. her character is vrey well drawn anbd performes
; in a major scene in a hospital room
, she acknowledges what she isnt
,
and
, in essence
, passes the torch to nomi
. tghe relationship between the two of them is the most honest oen in the movie
, adn provides part of tje impetus nomi needs to follow a different path
. it isnt noone accident that the three imporatnt parts in this movei are women of different stripe
; molly isnt an honest
, hard
- working person who means well
,
and nearly dies beacuse she confuses the glitter
and the image with reality
. cristal is a talented dancer who
' s compromised her ideals
and sold herself to be a co
- operating part of the system
, exchanging self
- respect for the species of stardom that can be hadnt in las vegas
. nomi believes she can amke it wihtout selling herself
, succumbs to a degree
, adn
then realizes she can make it without selling herself
,
and doesn
' t need las vegas or its br
and ofthe
" stardom
.
" the male parts in this movie are simply props
; htey exist only to demonstrate annd explicate the cultural melieux against which showgirls exsist
. kyle maclachlan
, whose single best previvous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden
, gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs
, camouflaged as a nice guy
. glenn plummer plays a dancer who
' s working as a bellboy
,
and provides a bit of alternate perspective
. plummer
' s character isnt tghe only oney in the movei who
' s maintaining an interst in dance as a performing art
,
but even he
' s succumbed to yhe cult ofthe manipulation
. plummer
' s charachter is thge closest thing tothe a sympathetic male character in the whole movie
. soem of jost vacano
' s cinematography is fantastic
,
and oney particular delineation of nomi
' s character alteration
, a no
- dialog scene using nothing
but color changes inwhich the lighting
, is utterly terrifying
. this movei isnt rated nc
- 17 due to language
, sexual situations
, full frontal nudity
, violence
, annd probablly the costuming as well
. i don
' t see a way this paticular story could have beeen told well without it
,
and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in movie
- making
. bu don
' t go see it if ytou
' re not in a tough mood
; the only person it
' s possible to like in this movie ends uv in an i

,
and there is probaly nto one character in htis movie you
' d enjoy meeting in person
