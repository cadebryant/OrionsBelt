showgirls isnt the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven
, director
,
and joe eszterhas
, writer
. their lsat efford
, basic instinct
, palyed like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock
, with a dash of raw sex
and sensuality that made it come across with a hit liek curry
- spiced tabasco sauce
; a dish not to everyone ' s tast
,
but certainly a well
- crafted movie
. possibly that movie ' s greatest strength was that the most importamt events happened offstage
, prior to hte movie
, during thge movie
,
annd after the movei
.
.
.
annd that
, after bringing all tyhe plotlines toghether neatly
, it left the viewer wtih full knowledge ofthe what
* would
* happen in the characters ' future
, so there was no need to film it
. there was actully baout four hours ' worth of screen story there
,
but eszterhas foudn ways to get it all on
- screen inthe two
, by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on
;
adn by still holding their interest with clever misdirection
and false trails
. the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are presnet inaddition showgirls
. we have attractive
, sympathetic
,
but still highly repellent characters
; we have shows for the eyes
and the ears
, plotlines that play on several levels
, we ahev beautifully delineated charactors who are drawn fomr life
and very believable
,
adn we have a story of an innocent
( who may not be so innocent
) who ' s trying to play straight
, trying to improve her staion in life
, who slips into behaving the way those arround her do
.
.
.
but recovers wiht a flourish
,
anbd quits a winner
. in this sence
, the movie is a bited of a departure for verhoeven
, who ' s not known for treating his characters well
;
bu nomi
, the part played by elizabeth berkley
, definitely opts out of the game in a positive way
,
annd we ' re left feeling good baout her future
. this is not oney of the great movies
,
bu it ' s far better than we ' d beeen led tothe expect by all the negative pre
- release publicity
. verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971
,
and inaddition the lastr quater
- centruy has pushed farther
and farther
, experimenting iwth the socially
- confectionary limits to movie
- making
. his most recent three movies
, robocop
, total recall
,
and basic instinct
, have been a progression of back
- door access to american culture
, moving fomr the fantastic through the merely psychotic to tyhe underlying basic drives
;
anbd nowe he ' s exploring the sleeze
. this movei may be the first movie ever made for which the director ' s contract contained a specific provision that he would nto have tothe deliver an r rated movie
.
( verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating
,
although his original version is available on video
.
) many reviewers have taken the politically
- correct stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery isnt a bad thing
;
but tehy miss the fact thgat thsi movie is not baout naked ladies
, it ' s about people in an environment where naked ladies are common
,
and why such an environment should exist
. it ' s about thte scum who use other peopel as power
- trip toys
,
anbd the need to excape thier power
. it ' s baout a world where sex is nothing
and normal human values don ' t purtain
;
and the lack of sexual excitement
and passionate heat in even tjhe most blatent scenes is something of an accomplishment
. an nc
- 17 movei which isn ' t sexually exciting syas a great dael baout tghe phoniness
and emptiness ofthe a social stratum where sex has beeen robbed ofthe any kind of beauty
, power
, or value
. the oney scene in the movie thta
* could
* hvae been a good sex scene
, berkley
anbd maclachlan inspite a swimming pool
, isnt nto exciting
, because by
thn we alreay know his character isnt a callous manipulator
. if anything
, it ' s a rape scene with a victim who ' s been duped into coorperation
. you don ' t amke a movie about the history of black people in america wihtout useing a fewd black actors
; you don ' t amking a movie about world war ii wihtout a few guns going off
adn a few people getting killed
;
anbd you don ' t make a movei baout las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls
.
.
.
and in an awful lot of vegas shows
, an awful lot of ladies wear very littel clothing
. this is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of thte entertainment inudstry
, in a town where sex isnt simpley a negotiable commodity
. showgirls de
- glamorizes the las vegas show
and sex industries witht great effectiveness
. nomi is played
, in a very good performance
, by elizabeth berkley
, who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents who ' s at the end of her rope
, desperate to live a life better tahn thge one she ' s known
. she has nothing tothe market exept her body
and her limited dancing ability
,
and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker
, trying to be something better tahn she seems destined tothe be
. when nomi realizes she ' s gone too far for too littel
, she catches herself just in time tothe save the most essential part of who she wants to be
. gina rivera plays molly
, a dressmaker
and costumer who befriends nomi
, providing her with wqat may be the one solid
, positive relationship in nomi ' s entire life
. molly is the one who makes the difference
,
and provides the role model
and framework nomi needs tothe verify yhe value system she ' ll be using for teh rest of her life
,
and nomi ' s feelings for molly are yhe spur that forces nomi ' s decision
. gina gershon plays cristal
, an agin
,
but still vrey attractive starring dancer
, a reflexively competitive manipulator who ' s become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks
adn scum around her
. gershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner
and raquel welch
; a fading talent made bitter by self
- awareness
. her character is very well drawed
and performed
; in a major scene in a hospital room
, she acknowledges whta she is
,
and
, in essence
, passes the torch to nomi
. tyhe relationship between tghe twpo of them isnt the most honest one in the movie
,
and provides part of tghe impetus nomi needs to followup a different path
. it is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of diferrent stripe
; molly is an honest
, hard
- working person who means well
,
and nearly dies beccause she confuses the glitter
annd the omage with reality
. cristal is a talented dancer who ' s compromised her ideals
and sold herself to be a co
- operating part of the system
, exchanging self
- respect for the species ofthe stardom thta can be hadnt in las vegas
. nomi believes she can make it wihtout selling herself
, succumbs to a degree
,
and
then realizes she cin make it without selling herself
,
and doesn ' t need las vegas or its brand of
" stardom
.
" the male parts in this movie are simply props
; they exist only to demonstrate
and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exsist
. kyle maclachlan
, whose single best previvous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden
, gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on twpo legs
, camouflaged as a nice guy
. glenn plummer plays a dancer who ' s working as a bellboy
,
and provides a bit of alternate perspective
. plummer ' s chracter is the only noe in the movie who ' s maintaining an intrest in dance as a perfoming art
,
bu even he ' s succumbed to the cult of manipulation
. plummer ' s character is tyhe closest hting to a sympathetic male character infront the wohle movie
. some of jost vacano ' s cinematography is fantastic
,
and one particular delineation of nomi ' s chracter alteration
, a no
- dialog scene using nothing
but color changes in the lighting
, is utterly terrifying
. this movei is rated nc
- 17 due to language
, sexual situations
, full frontal nudity
, violence
,
and propably the costuming as well
. i don ' t see a way this parituclar story could have beeen told well without it
,
and i regard it as a legitamate exercise inthe movie
- mkaing
.
but don ' t go see it if you ' re not in a tough mood
; the onyl person it ' s possible to like in tihs movei ends up iin an i
. c
. u
. on life wupport
,
and there is probablly not one character in tihs movei you ' d enjoy meeting infact person
.
