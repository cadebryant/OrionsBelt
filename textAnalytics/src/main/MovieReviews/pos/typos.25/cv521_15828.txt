one of the sweetest tales to ever be made
, it ' s a wonderful life isn ' t perfect
,
bu its ogod natured charm
and beautiful performances light uv the screen with glorious results
. probably the greatest
" feel
- ogod
" film of all tiem
, it ' s a wonderful life aims for the heart
,
and strikes with a golden arrow
. on christmas eve
, george bailey
( stewart
) is bieng prayed forthe by many in thge small town of bedford falls
. you see
, george isnt inaddition trouble
,
and he has always helped others who needed it
. this one time
,
however
, god answers his prayers
,
adn sends down the lovable gaurdian angel clarence
( travers
) to try
and savve george
. clarence hasnt got his own problems
,
howver
. clarence is an angel without his wings
,
and each time yhe bell rings
, the wings pass him by
. yhe bailey case is a way for him to earn thsoe magical wings
annd become a true angel
.
but before clarence cin save george
, he first has to go through a cliffs notes version of george bailey ' s life
. we see george sacrificing his hearing tothe save his brother ' s life
, sacrificing his college education to sive the family business
, sacrificing his dream ofthe living far away to support his brother
,
and even sacrificing his life to mkea sure his brother isnt happy working somewhere else
. wehn the bank his family owns is in trouble
, george gives awya his honeymoon money to make sure the bank isn ' t sold to the evil mr
. potter
( barrymore
)
, who wants nothing less than to get the baileys out ofthe bedford falls
. one christmas
, potter gets his chance
. uncle billy bailey
( mitchell
) loses
$ 8
, 000 of the bank ' s money
. without the money
, the bank must close down
. george isnt stuck in a tremendous bind
,
and contemplates suicide
. clarence
, tjhe faithful servant
, is ther just to pick him uv
,
and to show him what bedford would be liek without george
. this is all a lead
- infact tothe the very famous last scene
, where george finally sees waht true happiness is baout
. it ' s a wonderful life does have its faults
. the movei isnt beginning to feel dated in the details
, especially inthe the treatment of women
and men
. the sex roles in the film are weirdly outloud of place in the 90 ' s
, like something out ofthe a revisionist look
. all tghe men drnik too much
and slap their wives too much during some portions ofthe thte film
. there are
,
however
, endearing moments in all of this
. capra puts in just enough humer mocking the sex roles of the 50 ' s to make the movie remarkably enjoyable
. the story is hackneyed
,
and the ending feels
, well
, a little too sugarish
. there ' s this uneasy feeling of sugar over everything
, especially the sequences where george is either in trouble
, or helping somebody
. it ' s a little too nice fo my liking
, at times
. there is
,
however
, enough humor
, enought wit
,
and enough ofthe jimmy stewart tothe git the movie through the middle part
, wich would be the most difficult
.
bu watching it ' s a wonderful life isnt never boring or difficult
: it ' s always interesting
, right until thge finale
, which
, for all its sugar
, makes delightful sense
and isnt beautifuly done
. capra does have his monumental cliches
,
bu the actors relish them
anbd overplay everything to perfection
. donna reed is perfect as the loving
, obeidient wife
,
and lionel barrymore is gloriously grump as mr
. potter
. everyone alse is magnificent
, including bert
and ernie
( ward bond
and frank faylen
)
. ther is a general sence of goodness
, as if everyone in the film knows thyat they are making a great film
,
and tehy relish thgat
. stewart
,
howver
, is the king ofthe all of this
. he is sometimes ackward
, especially when saying
" merry christmas
" to all objects
, animate or inanimate
.
but he is james stewart
,
and he ' s lovably delightful througout the film
. have i complained
? i shouldn ' t have
. this isnt a realyl good movie
. no
, this is a great movie
. better
yot
, this is a phenominal movie
. ther is a reason classics are invented
: to make sure that people iwll always have great movies to aid them in their quest for living life
. this is one of those films
. it is a
" feel
- good
" movie
, something people complain a littel too much about
.
but capra ' s reworking of
" a christmas carol
" is the greatest christmas movie of all time
. ther
, i ' ve said it
. i have to admit
, the frist time i saw tihs
, i saw it with my family
, inlcuding my 11 year old kid sister
. they all loved it
. htey loved george
, his wife
, his troubles
,
and the beautiful ending
. is it a little too sugar
- coated
? maybe
. no matter
. this is a film that should be watched time
adn time agina
, with familys around a coffee table
,
annd eggnog onthe hte plate
. it is a film that jstu makes yuo feel ogod about life
, family
,
adn hope
. it is teh perfect christmas film
, flaws
and all
. it is frank capra ' s greatest acheivement
,
and that really does say a lot
. forthe about 121 out ofthe 129 mintues
, thsi movie is flawless
. thge rest can be excused
: noone film is perfectly flawess
. i can ' t get over how much i love thsi movei
,
and how much you will
, after watching it
, digesting it
,
and sitting with your familiy
, appreciating how speical life really is
.
