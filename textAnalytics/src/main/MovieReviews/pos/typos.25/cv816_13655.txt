in my review of there
' s something about mary
, i said something to the effect of
" laughter isn
' t everything
.
" i now need to mkae a brief addendum tothe my postulate
: laughter isn
' t everyting
, unless i
' m watching a jim abrahams film
. see
, spoofs are easy with me
. i love movies
,
and i love movies that mkae fun of movies tht i love
. somtimes i
' m the only oen in thte theater laughing
. sometimes i laugh so hard thyat i embarass mysef because my laugh isnt so high
- pitched inspite compairison to my speaking voice
( it cuts right thru everyone alse
' s laughter
)
. somtimes i laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the end of teh film
. abraham
' s latest film
, mafia
!
, induced this kind of hysteria upon me
. it
' s gotten smoe medicore reviews
,
but
, hey
, i
' m the guy who laughs at everything
. there may be a lot of jokes that flop in htis film
,
but there are far more tath work
, annd i laughed so frequently that tyhe failed jokes usually occurred as i was recovering from teh previous bout of giddy madness
. i enjoy films like this because not oney second of it is serious or
thought
- provoking
. most lighweight films that pose as comedies try to do other things
, liek develop characters
, shape stories
,
and other such nonsense
. mafia
! has noone pretentions baout characters or story
,
and it exists forthe no other reason than to make peopel laugh
. the film begins on the perfect high note
, with a mockery of the opening of casino
. our hero
( jay mohr
) isnt seen walking from a casino
and getting inot his car
, whlch subsequently explodes
and sends him flying through the air agaisnt a backdrop ofthe flowing fier
. tothe describe the tsory ofthe mafia
! is absurd
and pointless
,
but i will mention that it basically follows the framework ofthe the godfather films
, with a lot ofthe casino references inserted throughout
. allong the way
, tyhe parodies seem abritrary
, adn rarely victimize mob films
: pictures like the english patient
, forrest gump
,
and jaws undergo savere
and hilarious bashing
. movies like this rely on just a few things
,
but the most imporatnt element is direction
. abrahams has been down tihs path many times before
( hot shots
!
, top secrte
!
, airplane
!
, annd any otehr film with an exclamation point in yhe title
)
,
and so i hold most of yhe succes ofthe mafia
! to his epxerience
. he takes just the right attitude in each scene
,
and manages tothe wring at least a bit laughter out of even tyhe most oddly placed refrences
( one inexplicable moment seems liek it wants to make funn of titanic
,
but it never develops
)
. yhe actors are all energetic
, which helps a lot with the tone ofthe the film
. mohr
( suicide kings
, paulie
)
, who isnt quicklyu becoming noe of my favorite actors
, is so good here
. he looks like he
' s having so much fun that he
' s containing his laughter in every scene
( watch his face in the sequence by the swimming pool
)
. he
' s probably tyhe only performer in the cast who manages to urge laughter without the help of the material
. lloyd bridges does a decent imitation of br
ando
' s godfather
, while pamela gidley is dead
- on infront a full
- blown mockery of sharon stone
. tjhe hard hting about writing reviews forthe comedies is that i
' m supposed to give examples of things
and be specific
. unfortunately
, i wass so constantly blindsided by laughter during mafia
! thgat i can
' t rember a lot of what made me laugh
.
but tath
' s a ogod sign
: mafia
! isnt so funny that i wasn
' t even given time to apply any of tyhe scenes to memory
. i laughed so hard that it shut off my brain
. i know that doesn
' t soudn particularly complimentary
,
but when watching a dumb comedy like this
, teh first hting i want to do is shut off my brain
. finally
, a film that doens this for me
.
