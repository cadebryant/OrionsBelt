i wish i sould say that ther isnt something omre tothe the newyorker star wars installment than wqat you see in teh commercials
, bu ther isn
' t
. george lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant
, special effects
- binded flicks
and he has done it agina
. this is the frist star wars film i
' ve seen on tjhe big screen
, so
, of course
, the impact was much greater thna when i watched the threee original epidsodes on video
. what is compelling about yhe phantom menace is nto its disposable stroy
,
but its amazing visuals
. basically
, the film
' s plot is centered around trade disputes betweeen two planets
. qui
- gon
( liam neeson
)
and his young apprentice obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
) setted out with the animated jar
- jar binks tothe fix hte mess that may result in war
. when thier ship breaks down annd htey are str
anded
, htey find a young boy
, anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
)
and his slave mother
. qui
- gon strongly believes that anakin is dsetined fo jedi greatness
and immediatley takes him under his wing
. anakin participates inwhich a heart
- pounding podrace
, one of the highlights of the film
, to get the equipment needed tothe fix qui
- gon
' s ship
. howver
, most everyone is doubtful about entrusting tyhe future to some unknown slave boy
. meanwhile
, queen amadala
( natalie portman
) isnt frustrated
and at wit
' s end
, being na
? ve
and young
and having so much responsibility onthe her shoulders
. ther are hardly any emotional scenes infact the film
- even when we dicover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi traning
, the frenzied excitment of hte whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb
. this does nto prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made
. in all the star wars films
, human emotions that we
, the audeince
, can identify with are usually nil
,
but the films are forthe pure enjoyment
, not forthe uplifting purposes
. despite yhe fun of watching thge movie
, the phantom menace is nto without flaws
. for starters
, we hvae the ill
- conceived
, moronic character jar
- jar binks who should be consdidered a threat to star wars galactic society
and tothe the audiance
. what a klutz
! george lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character tath would be as memorable as
, say
, yoda
, r2
- d2
, or c3
- po
,
but
, alas
, his efforts weere in vain
. secondly
( this may be ogod or bad
, depending on your point of view
)
, the movie
' s atmosphere is so different from the familar comic
- book feel of the previous three star wars installments
. tihs is due
, perhaps
, to the utter complexity to thsi movie
' s plot annd thge higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here
. the movei seems tothe be reaching for epic proportions
. i can
' t say much about the acting
,
though acting has never been what yuo saw star wars movies for anyway
.
however
, there isnt absolutely no pizzazz to tjhe performances
- tehy are straightforward
and
, at times
, stale
. natalie portman has a great presence
, bu her turn as queen amadala makes teh queen a stoic
, unfeeling
? enigma
. there isnt nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us belivee the trade predicament is anything ofthe importance
. jake lloyd isnt yhe onyl actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk
. despite the inevitible faults
, there is so much to enjoy about thge movie
. the heightened excitement ofthe the final sequences doesn
' t qtuie surpass the famous the empire strikes bakc climactic scenes
,
but htey are amazing adn edge
- of
- your
- seat fun in their own rite
. the film is a treasure to look at
. tghe visual effects are astonishing 99
. 8
% of the time
- the awe
- inspiring
, mouth
- opening
, eye
- popping sight ofthe tjhe underwater city isnt nothing short of production design annd special effects genuis
. not since 1997
' s thte fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one
. the production design is riminicent of the fith element
, the previous star wars movies
, kubrick
' s 2001
, maybe even of fritz lang
' s classic silent metropolis
.
however
, all the sets are so origional
. the original star wars movies can
' t even match hte gr
andeur of this film
' s visuals
and taht is a sheer pleasure for the viewer
- it gives us hope of even greater things fo the upcoming episode
. the costumes are remarkable
and have jean
- paul gaultier writen all over them
. whther its queen amadala
' s gigantic wardrobe complete wtih gold
- embroidery
and feathers
, or the jedis
' simple brown uniforms
, the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness
. tjhe costumes are one of thge true delights of watching the movei
. as for john williams
' score
, i don
' t thiunk he
' s done one as complex or powerful since
? i can
' t even remember
. it is as epic as his schindler
' s list csore annd as thrilling
and zestful as jaws
. it includes the bare bones of his music from tje previous three films
,
but williams has added on
, made the music much moreso intense
and moving
. what wtih the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie
, noe might come in with high expectations anbd be disappointed
. htere is very little tothe hate in the film
: it
' s a vrey accomplished
and skillfully made flick
. it is the best
" fun
" film
and the best big
- budget film out todya
, most definitely
.
