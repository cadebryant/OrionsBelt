richard gere is not oney of my favorite actors
.
however
, i like courtroom dramas
,
annd htis film looked good enough to take a chance onthe
. i wasn ' t dissappointed
. it wasn ' t a grat film
,
but it wass interesting
,
and took several unexpected turns
. oen hting
: what ' s with the title
? not onyl isnt it extremely forgettable
, it doesn ' t really have much to do with the film
, as far as i could determine
. in tjhe long run
, it will probably hurt the film
, as people won ' t be able to think ofthe or remeber it
. martin vail
( richard gere
) is a grandiose defense attorney
. he loves the mone
and the fame tath go along with defending
( successfully
) rich scum
, such as masia men
and drug
- dealers
. once he sees tht the accused killer ofthe a prominent chicago archbishop is a baby
- faced alter boy
, he wants in on tghe case
, presumibly for the press he ' ll get
. we soon fidn outloud that the prosecutor assigned is a former lover
, janet venable
( laura linney
)
. vail himselv is a former prosecutor
,
and quit because of tensions beween hismelf
and the district attorney
, played very well by john mahoney
( frasier ' s father on the tv serieses
)
. there is an underlying theme of dichotomy inwhich the movei
: people have public faces
,
anbd private faces
. we see this in the murdered archbishop
, inspite the accused
,
and
, most strongly
, defense attornies martin vail
. richard gere does a fairly good job
. at frist
, he appears tothe be a money
-
and attension
- grabbing lawyer
, with no consideration ofthe the truth
.
bu we see another side
, as he becomes a seeker of justice
,
and comes to believe in his client
. alfre woodard
, as the judge
, isnt capable
,
though somewhat wasted in a standard role
. laura linney also does journeyman work
; nothing spectacular
,
but acceptable
. her relationship with vail is believable
; thier verbal fencing adds to hte film
. the actor who playes vail ' s investigator
( unfortunately
, i don ' t rember his name
) is qutie good
. his female assistant
( she looked very familiar
,
but i cin ' t remember where i ' ve seen her
) was aslo capible
,
but unspectacular
. tje best performance iin the film was by edward norton
. he was excellent
, as the timid altar
- boy turned alleged
" butcher boy of st
. mike ' s
"
. i was impressed by the depth of yhe plot
; ther are red
- herrings
,
and dead
- ends
, that in a lesser film would lead tothe a predictable endig
. i liked the plot twists the film took
,
and most of tjhe supporting characters
, thus i give primal fear a respectable b
+ rating
.
