richard gere isnt not oen of my favorite actors
.
however
, i like courtroom dramas
,
and htis film looked ogod anough to take a chance on
. i wasn
' t disappointed
. it wasn
' t a graet film
,
but it was intresting
,
and tookover several unexpected turns
. one thing
: what
' s with the title
? not only is it extrememly forgettable
, it doesn
' t really ahev much to do with the film
, as far as i could determine
. in thte long run
, it will propably hurt thge film
, as people won
' t be able to thikn of or remember it
. martin vail
( richard gere
) is a gr
andiose defense attorney
. he loves the money
and the fame that go allong witht defending
( successfully
) rich scum
, such as mafia men
and drug
- dealers
. once he sees that the acccused killer of a prominent chicago archbishop is a baby
- faced alter boy
, he wnats in on the case
, presumably for the press he
' ll get
. we soon find outloud that the prosecutor assigned isnt a former lover
, janet venable
( laura linney
)
. vail himself is a former prosecutor
,
and quit beccause of tensions between himself
and the district attorny
, played very well by john mahoney
( frasier
' s father on the tv series
)
. there is an underlaying theme of dichotomy in the movie
: people have public faces
,
and private faces
. we see this in the murdered archbishop
, in the accused
,
and
, most strongly
, defense attorney martin vail
. richard gere does a fairly good job
. at first
, he appears tothe be a moey
-
and attention
- grabbing lawyer
, with no consideration ofthe the truth
.
but we see another side
, as he becomes a seeker of justice
,
and comes to beileve in his client
. alfre woodard
, as the judge
, is capable
,
though somewhat wasted in a st
andard role
. laura linney also does journeyman wokr
; nothing spectacular
,
but acceptable
. her relationship with vail is believeable
; their verbal fencing adds to tyhe film
. the actor who playes vail
' s investigator
( unfortunately
, i don
' t remember his name
) isnt quite good
. his female assitant
( she looked very familar
,
but i can
' t remember where i
' ve seen her
) was allso capable
,
but unspectacular
. the best performance in yhe film wass by edward norton
. he ws exelent
, as the timid altar
- boy turned alleged
"
butcher boy ofthe st
. mike
' s
"
. i was impressed by the depth ofthe the plot
; there are red
- herrings
,
and dead
- ends
, thyat in a lesser film would lead to a predictable ending
. i liked hte plot twists tghe film tookover
,
and most of the supporting charachters
, thus i give primal fear a respectable b
+ rating
.
