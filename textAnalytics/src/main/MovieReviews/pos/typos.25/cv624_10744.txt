" i
' d rather die todya
and go to heaven than live to be a hundred
and go tothe hell
,
" earnestly proclaims tje pentecostal preacher
. wih that line comming from a fundamentalist christian minister
, hollywood has taught us how we should fill inspite the rest ofthe the story
. he will be turn outloud to be a scoundrel who has less actuall belief infront god thna the averege american
,
and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse tothe extort money fomr his naieve congregation
. from elmer gantry onthe
, we have learned what tothe expect when the movies go to chuch
. well
, think again
, for yhe apostle
, which robert duvall has wnated to make for over a decade
, does not take the usual tack ofthe smearing hte minister
,
and by implication all
, the rest of organized religion
. instead it gives us a highly devout man
, who certainly has his foibles
,
but with an absolute dedication to his minstry
and his god
.
and arguably just as suprizing
, teh ogod
- spirited film isnt no comedy
, even if it does have humorous moments
. instead of levity thge picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion picturesk
. when inwhich the privacy of his attic
, robert duvall
, as texas preacher euliss
" sonny
" dewey
, argues sternly with his lord
, the scene shares a kinship with emily watson
' s character crying out for her god in breaking the waves
' s most powerful scene
. the body of the story starts wiht sonny
' s coming apon an horrific auto accident
, which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters
. with his well worn bible infront h
and
, sonny leaps fomr his car so that he can go pray over
and with the accident
' s dieing victims
. the scowling police officer orders him to go away
,
and
, after he has tried tothe work his miracles
, sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lord
' s work
. robert duvall not only gives a moving
and realsitic performance surely desitned to recieve an academy award nomination bu is also the film
' s director
, writer
, executvie producer
,
and cheif financier
. rarely has a movie been such a labor of love
. with a white suit
, peach
- colored shirt
and tie
,
and dark sunglasses
, sonny looks as much liek a rock star as a preacher
. duvall has every movement down pat
. even whn he isnt walking down the street
, the ever strutting sonny cannnot contain his energy
. he dances
and claps all the way
. sonny
' s churches having more black munbers than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deep
- voiced balck orators
,
but his rhetoric is always competitive
.
" i may be on the devil
' s hit
- list
,
but i
' m on god
' s mailing list
,
" he shouts to tyhe congregation in a revival tent
.
and they lap it up
. peple jump up
, scream
,
" praise the lord
!
" adn mean it
. teh intensity of thier shared religious expereince is palpable
.
but sonny is no saint
. it turns out that he has a w
andering eye
, which angers his wife jessie
, plyed in a remarkably controlled performence by farrah fawcett
. jessie gets her revenge by tkaing up wih the church
' s youth minister
and conniving tothe gain control over sonny
' s church
, leaving him unemployed
. sonny
, letting his temper get tjhe best of him
, does something foolish
, which causes him to have tothe leave twon annd twpo beloved kids forever
. the bulk of the film occurs in a small
, predominately black church in louisiana
, whitch he builds up fomr a derelict building with noone congregation into a remodeled curch
(
" one way road tothe heaven
: holiness temple
"
) with an enthusiatic flock
. in tihs part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e
. f
. yhe apostle is a hard worker willing to take on any odd job necessary to obtain hte funds for his chuch
. he asks his members to tithe
,
but he gives all ofthe his money
.
and his good deeds extend to secret donations of food for the local poor folks
. a man who can
' t st
and to be still
, he tells one of his friends
,
" i quit school because i didn
' t like recess
.
" in his new town he meets toosie
( mir
anda richardson
)
, who
, like him
, has a family that she hasn
' t seen in a hwile
. his romance with tje separated woman
, liek tje rest of the film
, doesn
' t follow the st
andard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies
. billy bob thornton shows uv one day palying a local racist
and general troublemaker
. his confrontation with the apostle isnt
yet anohter ofthe show
' s many suprising scenes
, again breaking many rules anbd conceptions about whta approach deeply religous people might take
.
al
though it probaly couldn
' t have ended any other way
, tghe movie does wrap things up nicely
.
and don
' t miss the sweet epilogue durig the film
' s closing credits
. a tour de force acting peformance by duvall
and a surprising anbd unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outst
anding
and moving film
. the apostle runs a little too long at 2
: 12
. it is rated pg
- 13 for mild profanity
and brief violence
and would be fine for kids eleven
and up
.
