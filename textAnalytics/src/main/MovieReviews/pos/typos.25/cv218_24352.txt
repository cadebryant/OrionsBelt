when you go to the movies as much as i do
, yuo unfourtunately end up seeing certain movei trailers one too many times
. such wass the case with frequency
. every time i went tothe a screening
, there was the frequency preview
. it looked awful
. it looked cheesy
, sappy
and ridiculous
. it looked like a flop
. well
, whoever put thast trailer toghether should be fired
, because in terms of pure entertainment
, frequency is noe of the best of the eyar thus far
. frequency boasts a compelling story line
. an occurrence of freakish solar activity allows police detective john sullivan
( james caviezel
) to speak to his fireman father frank sullivan
( dennis quaid
) through a ham radio
, despite the fatc that frank has been dead for 30 yersa
. john is able tothe give his father information that prevents his death in a warehouse fire
,
but by doign so causes otehr changes
. somehow
, a serial killer
' s reign of terror
, whihc in the original timeline hadnt been stopped at three murders
, extends to ten victims
.
.
. including john
' s mother
. this isnt director gregory hoblit
' s third film
( the other twpo bieng primal fear
and fallen
)
. witht all threee
, he
' s managed to attach himself to great scripts
( this one by toby emmerich
, whose only previous movie experience was as a music supervisor on numberous newyorker line films
)
and add equally great direction
. also
, he apparantly likes to have his films wrap uv with a kick
- ass endig
. frequency is noone exception
, the ending isnt unpredictable anbd incredibly satisfying
. hoblit isnt threee for three
,
and i hope he can keep it up
. nowe everyone cin argue logic thsi
and logic that all you want with the sci
- fi elements of frequency
.
but hte fact of the marter is that time travel has never beeen achieved
. who
' s to say how something works
and how it doesn
' t when it
' s never happened
? is it because we
' ve become accustomed to time travel
" laws
" from other places like
" star trek
" anbd the back tothe tghe future trilogy
and
" quantum leap
"
? yes
, if you sit down
and think about it
, certian plot elements in this film probably won
' t make any sense
. most films are like thta
. don
' t let thta dissuade you from seeing this fantastically entertaining film
however
. when frequency was over
, it made me wish i had seen it with my father so i could hve given him a hug
( okay okay
, shut up
)
. when you break it down past all its sci
- fi elements adn serial killer antics
, frequency is simply a movei about a father adn his son
and the bond that they share
. it
' s touching
, it
' s sincere
,
and it
' s what ultimately mkaes this movie work
.
