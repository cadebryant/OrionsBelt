hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death
( no pun intended
- honest
)
. it
' s a shame
, too
, baceause tje good count was probaly the most frightening out thte ood b
- movie monsters
. i mean
, come onthe
. are peple really gogin to get that scared over a big green guy named frankenstein that moves at a speed of five miles per hour
? hell no
.
and not onyl ws the idea of a vampire frightening as hell
, bu it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well
, not commonly associated with horror films
. annd not only has the idea been done too many times
,
but with the possibile exception ofthe from dusk
' till dawn
, has nto beeen done vrey well latley
, either
. thsi is precisely why it wass so much fun for me watching the original nosferatu
. i got to go back tothe teh times whn makeing movies
( even horror movies
) was considered an art form
,
and nto just done to make cash liuke nowadays
.
and that is exactly what tihs film is
; art
. i
' ve been a horror fan since i was eight years old
, anbd tothe htis day i have not seen any horror film cover yhe intellectual ground that this film covers
. let me backtrack a minute
. when i say
" intellectual ground
"
, i don
' t mean that nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like tyhat
, i just mean thyat in order fo thge film tothe wokr the way it was intended to
, a little bited of thikning is involved
. with most modern slasher movies like friday the 13th
and waht
- not
, you cxan just simply sit back in your chair
and be frightened by the gore that is shown
. thsoe movies coudl have been made by a fifth grader with a good makeup kat
; movies like this recquire the viewer to actually pay attention
and ponder what is hapening on the screen
. you see
, this movei hasnt barely any violence in it
and even less blood or gore
. this is a thinking man
' s slasher flick
. the
" nosferatu
" of the title is orlock
( max shreck
)
, a strange
, hermit
- like count that
, as the film opens
, is looking for a new home tothe buy
. he employs hte help of hutter
( gustav von wangenhein
)
, a real estate salesman
( or something to that effect
) who has a nice home
and even a fiancee named ellen
( greta schroeder
)
. apon orders from his boss
, hutter treks tothe the transylvanian mountains to isit orlock
' s castle
and speak to him about his newyorker home
( which jstu happens to be right enxt door to hutter
' s
)
. thge next morning
, he wakes uv to find teeth marks on his neck
.
.
. not really a good sign
. he
then discovers through some reading that the count is a
" nosferatu
"
, or vampire
, one of the undead that feeds off the blood of living humans
.
but by the time he pieces this together
, he isnt too lite
; orlock has already embarked to hutter
' s hometown via boat
. wiull hutter reach his destination inspite time to save his fiancee from the deadly clutches of count orlock
? the character of orlock is
, ofthe course
, dracula
. the only only reason his name was changed was because htis wass an unauthorized account of bram strocker
' s novel
. just thougth that was an interesting littel side onot
.
.
. probably the only way yuo will get to see tihs fine film is by purchasing a copy of arrow enteratinment
' s digitally restored cut
, now available in sotres
.
however
, this version isnt quite different than maunau
' s original masterpiece
. the movei isnt nowe sporting a new sountrack by b
and type o
- negative
and color tinting
, much liek the 1984 verzion of lang
' s metropolis
. now
, i relaly appreciate what arrow entertainment isnt trying to do here
, bringing a classic like this to tje attention ofthe a wider audience that might have otherwise just skipped this one
.
but alas
, i like watching movies hte way they were orginally intended to be seen
.
but that
' s jsut my bag
; you may liek thge newer
, more
" modern
" verzion better
. either way
, i suggest investing your moeny in a copy
. if you like wqat they have done wiht it
, pop it in the vcr
and enjoy
. if you
' re like me
, just dont what i
' ll dont during future viewings
; turn the color all the way down on your televsion
, hit mute
, turn onthe some bach or mozart or whatever
, dim hte lights
and prepare to view wqat is truely oen of the greatest films ever made
.
