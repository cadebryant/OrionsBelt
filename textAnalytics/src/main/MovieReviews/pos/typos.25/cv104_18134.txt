based on tyhe boris karloff
' s classic by tyhe smae nmae
, tghe mummy starts off with the high
- priest of osiris
, imhotep
, who murders the pharoah forthe his mistress annd is punished by bieng mummified inspite the most horrifying way possible
-
- b
andaged up
, having his tongue removed
,
and being covered in flesh
- eating scarab beetles
,
then entombed
.
.
. all while still alive
. recap a few thous
and eyars later
, where a solider named rick
( played by br
andan fraser
) aids a young historian named evelyn
( played by rachel wiesz
)
and her brother
, jonathan
( plyed by john hannah
) in finding tghe book of amon ra
, in tje process inadvertently freeing the mummy
. problem is that the mummy wnats to revive his mistress
, using evelyn as a sacrifice
.
.
. walking in wih relatively low expectations
, i
thought this movei was actually pretty good
. tje visuals anbd cgi are astounding
, annd obviously not cheaply done at all
. they pack a ton ofthe detail into the images
, especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completly by cgi
. the computer spacial effects makes for some brilliant scenes
, such as unnerving moments involving flesh
- eating scarab beetles
and moments where the mummy goes after tjhe people who freed him
( aftter all
, those who took his artifacts are cursed
)
. unfortunately
, the film attempts to be way too much inthe such a short span ofthe timne
, becoming a tug of war for control between genres
. on one h
and
, it is a fast paced acation film
. onthe the other
, it
' s a frightening horror film
.
and onthe thge side
, it
' s a hilarious comedy
. ideally
, for it to be successful
, the film owudl have tothe focuse on one yhe more action oriented aspect
, with one character serving as the comic relief
( that would be johnson
)
. the problem with this film is tht it has at least three charactors serving as comic relief
, with rick occasionally delivering his witty one
- liner
. if they were trying to mkea a horror
- action
- comedy
, it would have helped if it were estalbished early on in the film
,
but unfortunately
, with yhe backstory ofthe imhotep
' s entombment
, that woudl be impossible
.
and thne htere
' s the slapstick fight scene beween a sword
- wielding rick
and an army of mummies
. while really well done
, it had the feel ofthe slapstick comedy
. replace yhe sword with a chainsaw
and you
' d effectively hvae ash fighting zombies in army ofthe darkness
. hwile entertaining
and funny
, it feels really out of place
. bu at least it
' s a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot ofthe
. on the whole
, the movie is pure popcorn fare from begining to end
, entertaining the audience
.
but i must end my review with a plea to movei theatre owners
.
.
. turn the sound down
! while a lot of theatres have good sound systems
, my ears were almost ringing as i walked outloud of the theatre
( tjhe sound isnt particually irritating
and will make you crap your pants if ytou
' re not careful
)
. when they were showing the trailer fo teh upcomming schwarzenegger film
,
" end of days
"
, it was so loud i couldn
' t make anytying out
.
