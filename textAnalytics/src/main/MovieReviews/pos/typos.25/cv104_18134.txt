based on the boris karloff ' s clasic by the smae name
, the mummy starts off with the high
- priest of osiris
, imhotep
, who murders tyhe pharoah fo his mistress
and is punished by bieng mummified in hte most horrifying way possible
-
- bandaged up
, having his tongue removed
,
annd bieng covered in flesh
- eating scarab beetles
,
hten entombed
.
.
. all hwile still alive
. recap a few thousand years later
, where a soldier named rick
( played by brandan fraser
) aids a young historian named evelyn
( plyed by rachel wiesz
)
and her brother
, jonathan
( played by john hannah
) in finding the book of amon ra
, iin tje process inadvertently freeing the mummy
. probelm is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress
, using evelyn as a sacrifice
.
.
. walking in with relatively low expectations
, i thought this movie was actually pretty good
. the visuals
and cgi are astounding
,
and obviously not cheaply done at all
. they pack a ton ofthe detail into the images
, especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completly by cgi
. the computer special effects mkaes fo some brilliant scenes
, such as unnerving moments involving flesh
- eating scarab beetles
and moments where the mummy goes after tje people who freed him
( aftter all
, those who took his artifacts are cursed
)
. unfortunately
, the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time
, becoming a tug of war forthe controll between genres
. on one hand
, it is a fast paced action film
. onthe the other
, it ' s a frightening horror film
.
and on yhe side
, it ' s a hilarious comedy
. ideally
, for it to be successful
, tjhe film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect
, with one charachter serving as the comic relief
( that would be johnson
)
. the problem iwth htis film is that it has at least three cahracters serving as comic relief
, with rick occasionally delivering his witty oen
- liner
. if htey were trying to make a horror
- acation
- comedy
, it owudl have helped if it were established early on in the film
,
but unfortunatley
, with the backstory of imhotep ' s entombment
, that owudl be impossible
.
and
then there ' s thge slapstick fight scene between a sword
- wielding rick
and an army of mummies
. while really well done
, it hadnt the feel of slapstick comedy
. replace tghe sword with a chainsaw
annd you ' d effectively have ash fighting zombies infront army of darkness
. while intertaining
and funny
, it fiels realy out ofthe place
.
but at least it ' s a break from thte naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of
. onthe the whole
, the movie isnt pure popcorn fare from beginning to end
, entertaining the audiance
.
but i must end my review with a plea to movei theatre owners
.
.
. turn the sound down
! while a lot of theatres haev good soudn systems
, my ears weere almsot rininging as i walked out of the theatre
( yhe sound isnt particularly irritating
adn will make you crap your pants if yuo ' re not careful
)
. when they were showing tyhe trailer fo the upcoming schwarzenegger film
,
" end of days
"
, it ws so loud i couldn ' t make anything out
