) the film follows renton who gets clean
, gets back inot heroin
and gets clean again
. soem of the wit in tihs movie is sharp
and pulp fiction
- esque
,
and some is just dumb
& dumber gross
( thge bed sheets
)
and stupid
( tghe bb gun
)
although tghe film starts out on a comic note
, it takes a sharp term in the middle
,
and becomes alomst depressing
. the film is based on an irving welsh novel bearing the same title
. i cin honestly say that this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
. it is an obscure gem thgat has been over shadowed in tghe us by such movies as mission impossible
and id4
. the film is hard to follow with the hevy accents of the actors
. this is a veyr original film
, as far as films go today
. it definetly deserves mutiple viewings
( partly because of tghe slang
and accents
