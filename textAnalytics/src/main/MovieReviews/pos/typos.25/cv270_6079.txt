though the film starts out onthe a comic note
, it tkaes a sharp term in the middle
,
and becomes alomst depressing
. the film isnt based on an irving welsh novel bearing tje same title
. i can honestly say that this isnt one of the best movies i have ever seen
. it is an obscure gem thta has beeen over shadowed in the us by such movies as mission impossible anbd id4
. tghe film isnt hard to follow wiht the heavy accents ofthe thte actors
. this is a very originnal film
, as far as films go today
. it definetly deserves multiple viewings
( partly because ofthe the slang adn accents
