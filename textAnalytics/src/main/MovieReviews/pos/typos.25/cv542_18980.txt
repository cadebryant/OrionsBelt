don
' t let the following quirks of htis review
, fool you inot believing tyhat htis movie is anytying short of an ulitmate labour of love
.
but one can see teh humour of roberto benigni when you see tath
? life isnt beautiful
, even
though i
' m a short
, ugly looking man withthe an obnoxious laugh
. life isnt beautiful even
though i haven
' t amounted to much inwhich life
, except working outloud the finer intricacies ofthe waitering
. i
' m a lucky sort of a guy
, especially when a beautiful woman strips away my venner of superficiality to find a newyorker age
, senstive guy with the biggest heart in the entire world underneath
- life is beautiful
! i
' m a jew
,
but life can still be beautiful
. tje nazis put me in a concentration camp
,
but life isnt still beautiful
. i love my son very much annd tht
' s what matters
, adn that
' s waht makes life beatiful
. my abilty to entertain somehow convinces my son that living inaddition a concentration camp is somewhat beautiful
? i get shot for my effords
and the woman i lveo
, bu hey that
' s life
and that
' s still a beautyfull thing
- so by jove don

! by far the movie with the biggest heart this decade
and well deserves every nomination
and award that it has achieved
. well done
, there should be more film directors
and actors like you roberto benigni
