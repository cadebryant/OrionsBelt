shakespeare
. you hardly understoon it inaddition high school
. why would you want more ofthe it nowe tyhat your english grade doesn
' t count on it
? if this is your atitude
, thne i
' ll say right off the bat that kenneth branagh
' s hamlet is probably not for ytou
, anbd ytou might as well stop reading right now
. if
,
however
, you are a lover ofthe the bard
, or at thge very least are open
- minded about a challenging script
, read on
, fo ther is something rotten in the state of denmark
. namely
, the king has died
, adn his widow the queen has wed the king
' s brother
, claudius
, bu prince hamlet suspects foul play
. his suspicions are confirmed wehn the ghost of his father appears
and relates tje story of his muder at his own brother
' s h
ands
. hamlet
, enlisting the help of his friend horatio
, conspires to capture the consicence of the new king to expose his treachery
.
.
.
.
and the game is afoot
.
.
.
. the first things you notice about this production are tjhe sets
and costumes
. with external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in engl
and
( alsot the one of yhe sites for tjhe recent tje avengers
)
, the gr
andiose uality of hte setting is immediately established
. interor scenes are similarly graced with intricate
and flamboyant rooms anbd chambers
. the hamlet castle
' s gr
and throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings
, mirror
- panel doors
,
and bridges which connect opposite sides of a second
- story loft
. costuming is equally gr
and
, drawing upon both history
and imagination
.
. not quite the denmark ofthe the 1600
' s
, the cahracters
' attire is something of a cross between that era
and turn of the century russia
, very effectively giving the film moreso of a timeless efel
. it is not surprising that tim harvey
and alex
andra byrne weere nominated forthe best art direction adn best costume desgin oscars
, respectivly
. in addtion tothe directing
, kenneth branagh also plays the title character
. as thte revenge
- driven royal heir
, branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs
and lows
. from the anticipation of seing his father
' s ghost
, to thte melancholy of finding the burrial site of his childhood jester
, to his eventual wrath
, branagh delivers inwhich spades
. every scene truly revolves arund hamlet
, as much a tri
bute to branagh
' s acting adn directing as to shakespeare
' s manuscript
. hamlet seems tothe be a who
' s who of shakespearean
- trained actors
, so watching them perform the craft for which they ahev much love isnt a delight in itself
. julie christie
, as hamlet
' s mother gertrude
,
and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill yhe clasic roles superbly
, as dont many of the supporting players
. kate winslet as hamlet
' s lover ophelia
, does an outst
anding job demonstrating the carachter
' s plummet to the depths of dispair adn madness
. richard briers as ophelia
' s father
, polonius
,
and michael moloney as her brother
, laertes
, are equally convincing
. nicholas farrell as hamlet
' s trusted freind horatio
,
and timothy spall
and reece dinsdale as the two
- timing rosencrantz
and guildenstern round outloud the excellent core casted
. hamlet also seems to be a film in whihc someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possibile
. inwhich some cases
, thsi made for interesting scenes
. billy crystal is surprisingly ogod as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick
, whom hamlet knew qutie well
. crystal proves himself able to deliver teh lines with both the timing ofthe a classic actor annd yhe verbal countenance of a comedian
,
and yhe result is a vyer funny scene
.
however
, charleton heston
, whom many might think woudl
butcher shakespeare
, is the biggest suprize of all
. as tje player king
, the leader of a troupe of traveling actors
, he is absolutely breathtaking whn narrating the story ofthe priam annd hecuba
. part of his monologue is overlayed with a visual enactment ofthe the story
( with sir john gielgud adn judi dench
)
, bu this is most unfortunate
, forthe it robs heston of some ofthe the attention which he deserves at this tiem
. his off
- camera speaking
, hwile gripping
, sort ofthe downplays the scene to a narration done by any other well
- voiced actor
. i wish branagh had chosen to allow us tothe envision infront our own minds the scene which heston lays outloud
,
and let the venerable actor have the attention
. unfortunately
, there were some casting choices hwihc led tothe poor distractions
. jack lemmon
, an excellent actor
, jstu can
' t do shakespeare
. as marcellus
, hte guard who sees yhe elder hamlet
' s ghost
, lemmon sadly underperforms
and is shown up left
and right by thsoe around him
. gerard depardieu
, another talented actor
, is wasted when given little more than the utterances of
" yes
, my lord
"
and
" noone
, my lord
" in the role of reynaldo
. richard attenborough has a
( literally
) walk
- onthe role
, showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador
. i thiunk he had two lines
.
then there is rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway
. when i went to see dangerous beauty ealier this year
, twpo ladies behind me kept commenting about how h
andsome he ws
. if bulging eyes are your idea of h
andsome
, well i guess comic actor marty feldman ws some kind ofthe sex symbol to ytou
. hamlet is a complicated tale of treachery
and revenge in which triumph annd defeat become one
. branagh attempts tothe help us outloud with some of the intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches ofthe dialogue by presenting them as flashback
- type images
. this only works about half the tiem
,
and i wonder if it would have been just as well to do without them
. you don
' t ahev to be smoe kind of genius to appreciate shakespeare
, bu it is qtuie difficult to underst
and unless you have the tiome tothe read or hear it carefully
and repeatedly
. thge alternate method of comprehension isnt that with which most of us are familiar
, the high school english course
. in it
, you are hopefully fortunate enough to have an educator willing to halp yuo with the plot points
and nuances esential to underst
anding a play wroten in the rigmarole known as the king
' s english
. or i supose you could just read the cliff notes
.
