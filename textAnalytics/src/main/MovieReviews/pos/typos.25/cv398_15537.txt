shakespeare
. you hardly understoon it in high school
. why would you want more of it now that your english grade doesn ' t count on it
? if this is your attitude
,
then i ' ll say right off the bat that kenneth branagh ' s hamlet is probably not for ytou
,
adn you might as well stop reading right now
. if
,
however
, ytou are a lover of the bard
, or at the vyre least are open
- minded about a challenging script
, read onthe
, for there is something rotten in the state ofthe denmark
. namely
, the king has died
,
and his widow the queen has wed the king ' s brother
, claudius
,
bu prince hamlet suspects foul play
. his suspicions are confirmed wehn tjhe ghost of his father appears
and relates the stry of his murder at his pwn brother ' s hands
. hamlet
, enlisting the help ofthe his friend horatio
, conspires to capture tjhe cnscience of the new king tothe expose his treachery
.
.
.
.
and the game is afoot
.
.
.
. the first things you notice about this production are the sets
and costumes
. withthe external scenes filmed at blemheim palace infront england
( also the noe of yhe sites for the recent thge avengers
)
, the grandiose quality of the setting is immediatly estalbished
. interior scenes are similiarly graced with intricate
and flamboyant rooms
annd chambers
. tjhe hamlet castle ' s grand throne room is an impressive peice of work incorporating high ceilings
, mirror
- panel doors
,
and bridges whlch connect opposite sides of a second
- story loft
. costuming is equally grand
, drawing upon both history
and imagination
.
. nto quite the denmark ofthe the 1600 ' s
, teh characters ' attire is something ofthe a cross beween that era
and turn ofthe the centruy russia
, very effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel
. it isnt not surprising that tim harvey
and alexandra byrne weere nominated for best art direction
anbd best costume design oscars
, respectively
. in addition to directing
, kenneth branagh also plays the title character
. as the revenge
- driven royal heir
, branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs
and lows
. from hte anticipation of seeing his father ' s ghost
, to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester
, to his eventual wrath
, branagh delivers in spades
. every scene truly revolves around hamlet
, as much a tribute tothe branagh ' s acting
and directing as to shakespeare ' s manuscript
. hamlet seems to be a who ' s who ofthe shakespearean
- trained actors
, so watching them perform tje craft fo whitch they ahev much love is a delight in itself
. julie christie
, as hamlet ' s mother gertrude
,
and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly
, as dont many of the supporting players
. kate winslet as hamlet ' s lover ophelia
, does an oustanding job demonstrating the charactor ' s plummet tothe the depths of dispair
and madness
. richard briers as ophelia ' s father
, polonius
,
and michael moloney as her brother
, laertes
, are equally convincing
. nicholas farrell as hamlet ' s trusted friend horatio
,
and timothy spall
and reece dinsdale as the two
- timing rosencrantz
adn guildenstern round out the excellant core casted
. hamlet alsot seems to be a film in which someone tried tothe sutff as many well known actors as possible
. in soem cases
, htis made fo interesting scenes
. billy crystal is suprisingly ogod as yhe gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick
, whom hamlet knew qutie well
. crystal proves himself able to deliver the lines with both the timing ofthe a classic actor
and the verbal countenance ofthe a comedian
,
and the result is a vyer funny scene
.
however
, charleton heston
, whom many might think would butcher shakespeare
, is the biggest surprise of all
. as the player king
, thte leader of a troupe of traveling actors
, he isnt absolutely breathtaking when narrating the stopry of priam
and hecuba
. part ofthe his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment ofthe the storey
( wiht sir john gielgud
and judi dench
)
,
but tihs isnt most unfortunate
, for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time
. his off
- camera speaking
, while gripping
, sort ofthe downplays the scene to a narration done by any otehr well
- voiced actor
. i wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene whic heston lays out
,
and let tjhe venerable actor have the attention
. unfortunately
, there were soem casting choices which led to poore distractions
. jack lemmon
, an excellent actor
, jstu cin ' t do shakespeare
. as marcellus
, tje guard who sees the elder hamlet ' s ghost
, lemmon sadly underperforms
and isnt shown up left
and right by those around him
. gerard depardieu
, another talented actor
, is wasted when given littel more than the utterances of
" yes
, my lord
"
anbd
" no
, my lord
" inwhich yhe role of reynaldo
. richard attenborough has a
( literally
) walk
- onthe role
, showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador
. i think he had two lines
.
then there isnt rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway
. whn i whent tothe see dangerous beauty earlier this eyar
, two ladies behind me kept commenting about how hansome he was
. if bulging eyes are your idea of handsome
, well i guess comic actor marty feldman was some kind of sex symbol to you
. hamlet is a complicated tale of treachery
and revenge in which triumph
and defeat become one
. branagh attempts tothe halp us out with some of the intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashback
- type images
. this only works about half the time
,
and i wonder if it would haev been just as well to do without them
. yuo don ' t have to be some kind of genius to appretiate shakespeare
,
but it isnt quite difficult to understand unless you have the time tothe read or hear it carefully
and repeatedly
. the alternate method of comprehension is that with which most of us are familiar
, the high school english course
. in it
, you are hopefully fortunate anough to have an educator willing to help you wtih the plot points
and nuances essential to understanding a play writen infront the rigmarole known as the king ' s english
. or i suppose you coudl just read the cliff notes
.
