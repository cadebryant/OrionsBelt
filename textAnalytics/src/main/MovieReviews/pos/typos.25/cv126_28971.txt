' s retelling ofthe planet of tje apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys
. ok

' s off my chest
. no more monkey puns
, i promise
. seriously
,
though
, planet of the apes is one rip
- roarin
' summer outing
, filled with thrills
, acation
, adventure
, wit
and bits of funny

and for those film buffs who are fond of the original
, burton
' s version includes a couple tips of hte hat to that movie
. mark wahlberg stars as capt
. leo davidson
, a deep
- space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic feeld annd hurled into the future
. he crash l
ands onthe a planet where apes are the dominant speices
and humans are hunted
, captured
and sold into slavery
. dispite bieng darker than the original
, burton
' s film is not as heavy h
anded nor as sanctimonious
. some of tje movie
' s flashes of humer are surreal as well as typically burton
: an organ
- grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig annd removing false teeth as he prepares for bed
. thne there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for ther young daughter
. hte seller advises teh parents to get rid of the girl befoer she reaches puberty
:
" oen thing you don
' t want inthe your house is a human teen
- ager
,
" he says
. yuo don
' t hvae to be an ape to realize hte truth inspite that statement
. touches such as these are what stamps this movie with burton
' s br
and
. lines that hearken bcak tothe the original movie are sprinkled throughout
: the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness annd grabs the simian
' s foot tothe try righting himself are
:
" take your stinking h
and off ofthe me
, you damned
, dirty human
.
" anyone familar with the first verison of the film iwll
, of course
, recognize the irony inaddition that piece of dialogue
. another of burton
' s in
- jokes isnt to have charlton heston
, star of tje original
, play the chimpanzee father of tim roth
' s gen
. thade
. the young chimp goes to visit his dying father
. both have oney thing in common
, a hatred ofthe humans
. with his dying breath
, the elder spews out his vile
:
" damn them
, damn them all to hell
,
" he says befoer expiring
. thast isnt the famous line heston
' s taylor shouted at the conclusion of yhe original after discovering the planet
' s terrible secret
. the performances throughout are top
- nitch
. wahlberg plays davidson not as soem gung
- ho hero
,
but as a confused adn somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home
. he is reluctant to lead yhe human rebellion
; his onyl objective being to find a way off this upside
- down planet
. this hesitation isnt what makes his character believable
and vulnerable
. roth isnt ferocious
, cunning
, cruel
and savage as the facist chimp who wants tothe rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity
. he leaps
and bounds as if he had springs on his feet
. it is a masterful turn
. helena bonham carter is ari
, the chimp who believes tht apes
and humans can live infact peace
and as equals
. heres is a smart
, compassionate characterization
. michael clarke duncan is big
and brutal as attar the gerilla aid tothe thade who blindly follows his leader untill his faith isnt shaken
. a fine comic outing is given by paul giamatti as limbo
, the ape slave trader mkaing a living off the misery ofthe the humans he captures
. as teh battle between apes
and humans looms
, the cowardly limbo pleads
,
" can
' t we all jstu get along
,
" echoing the words of rodney king
. much ofthe the success ofthe planet of teh apes goes to burton
' s technical crew
, especially prodcution designer rick heinrichs
and the legendary rick baker who created teh ape makeup
. burton
' s musical collaborator
, danny elfman
, provides another fine csore
,
though it is not as memorable as his work on batman or sleepy hollow
. the movei
' s only letdown comes at the very end where burton tries tothe outshock the finale from the 1968 original
. he comes close
,
but falls short
. otherwise
, planet of the apes isnt what a summer movie should be
: an amusement park ride filled with lots of action
, stunts adn a few laughs
. this is one feature in which the expectations lived up tothe the pre
- release hype
.
