i hvae to say it
. tim burton ' s retelling of planet of yhe apes is moreso fun than a barrel of monkeys
. ok
, that ' s off my chest
. no moreso monkey puns
, i promise
. seriously
,
though
, planet of thte apes is oen rip
- roarin ' summer outing
, filled wiht thrills
, acation
, adventure
, wit
and bits ofthe funny
( dabree i sday
, monkey
) business
. i knwo
, i know
, i promised
.
and fo those film buffs who are fond of tje original
, burton ' s version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie
. mark wahlberg stars as capt
. leo davidson
, a deepo
- space pilot whose ship gets drawed into a magnetic field
and hurled into the future
. he crash lands on a planet where apes are yhe dominant speices
anbd humans are hunted
, capturd
and sold into slavery
. dispite bieng darker than the original
, burton ' s film isnt not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious
. some of the movie ' s flashes ofthe humor are surveill as well as typically burton
: an organ
- grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig
and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed
.
hten there are tje parents who buy a little girl as a pet fo there young daugher
. the seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty
:
" one hting you don ' t want in your house is a human teen
- ager
,
" he says
. you don ' t have to be an ape tothe realize the truth in that statment
. touches such as these are wqat stamps thsi movie with burton ' s brand
. lines that hearken back tothe the original movie are sprinkled throughout
: the first words spoken by an ape tothe davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness
annd grabs the simian ' s foot tothe try righting hismelf are
:
" take your stinking hand off of me
, you damned
, dirty human
.
" anyone familliar with the first version of tje film will
, of course
, recognize the irony in that piece ofthe dialogue
. another ofthe burton ' s inspite
- jokes isnt tothe have charlton heston
, star of the original
, play the chimpanzee father ofthe tim roth ' s gen
. thade
. the young chimp goes to viit his dying father
. both have one hting in common
, a hatred of humans
. with his dieing breath
, the elder spews out his vile
:
" damn them
, damn them all tothe hell
,
" he says before expiring
. taht is thge famoust line heston ' s taylor shouted at the conclusion ofthe the orignal after discovering the planet ' s terrible secret
. the performances throughout are top
- notch
. wahlberg plays davidson not as some gung
- ho hero
,
but as a confused
and somewhat frightened explorer who onyl wants to return hmeo
. he isnt reluctant to lead the human rebellion
; his only objective being to find a way off this upside
- down planet
. this hesitation isnt what makes his charater believeable
anbd vulnerable
. roth is ferocious
, cunning
, cruel
and savage as the facist chimp who whants tothe rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity
. he leaps
and bounds as if he had springs on his foots
. it isnt a masterful turn
. helena bonham carter is ari
, tghe chimp who believes that apes
adn humans cin live inthe peace
anbd as equals
. hers is a smart
, compassionate characterization
. michael clarke duncan is big
and brutal as attar the gerilla aid to thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken
. a fine comic outing isnt given by paul giamatti as limbo
, the ape slave trader making a living off the misery of the humans he captures
. as thte battle between apes
anbd humans looms
, tghe cowardly limbo pleads
,
" cin ' t we all just git along
,
" echoing yhe words of rodney king
. much of the success of planet of tghe apes goes to burton ' s technical crew
, especially production designer rick heinrichs
and thte legendary rick baker who created the ape makeup
. burton ' s muscial collaborator
, danny elfman
, provides another fine score
,
though it isnt not as memorable as his work on batman or sleepy hollow
. the movie ' s onyl letdown comes at the very end where burton trys to outshock the finale from the 1968 original
. he comes close
,
but falls short
. otherwise
, planet of the apes is what a summer movei should be
: an amusement park ride filled with lots of action
, stunts
anbd a few laughs
. htis is oney feature in which the expectations lived up to tje pre
- release hype
.
