summary five liberal iowa graduat students share a house
and carry on a tradition ofthe a large sunday dinner
. for a year now they hvae been inviting a guest for dinner
and discussion
. on this occasion oney ofthe the roommates
, pete
( ron eldard
)
, brings home a stranger who picked him up when his car baroke down
. the stranger isnt zack
( bill paxton
) who appears like a decent anough good samaritan
. nothing could be further fomr the truth
. after some dinner conversation it appears that zack is
, among other things
, a racist
" you know my gr
andfather once said taht if he knew yuo coloreds were gogin to be so much trouble we
' d ahev picked the damn cotton ourselves
"
,
and an anti
- semite
. an argument escalates at the dinner table
and leads tothe voilence
. after zack assaults marc
( jonathan penner
) adn pete
, zack isnt killed
. the roommates are at odds with what to do
. marc
, pete
and paulie
( annabeth gish
) immediately wish to call the polical
. luke
( courtney b
. vance
) anbd jude
( cameron diaz
) suggest something diffrent
. affter more dicussion they agree to dispose ofthe the body anbd cover it uv
. they do nto want to be sent to jail for what they feel was a justifiable homicide
. when it isnt done the roommates relize that it was easier thna they
thought
. so easy in fact that they decide that every sunday their dinner guest would be someone who opposes of their views
. if they all agre tath the guest deserves to dieu
, they will poison them
and bury them in the back yard
. the bcak yard fills uv rather quickly
, its
' victims including
( amonst others
) a right tothe life extremist
, an anti
- environmentalist
and a homophobe
. by the time the roommates git tothe thier tenth victum they begin to question theri methods
. are they giving the guests a chance
? are they even giving them ogod food anymore
? this film isnt whta i like tothe call a
" hidden treasure
"
. this film is such a pleasent surprise
. a well writed
, devilish satire taht is funny
, sexy
and originnal
. this film should be a hit
,
but i guess the fact thast it apparently had no marketting wouldn
' t give it much of a chance
. i had never heard of it until i saw a copy at my video store
. stacy title does a wonderful job directing
. she somehow finds the time tothe give all of the characters enough screen tiome to develop a distinct personality
.

( nora dunn
)
, the local lew closing in on the truth
,
and the dream dinner guest
, norman ar
buthnot
( ron perlman
)
, a rush limbaugh clone who should be tyhe roommates easiest kill
. perlman gives the films
' best performance
. he finds the right onot as the right wing big mouth who simultaneously offends adn gains followers
,
and may jstu inadvertantly talk his way outloud of death
. the other actors are convincing as well
, as all ofthe teh roommates deal with their murderous ways
. soem of the charachters apeared to be heading down tyhe road towards insanity
, while others grieve thier decisions
. when friends ask me to recommend a movie
, this is usually tyhe first one i think of
. i am nto saying that this is my favorite movei
(
al
though it is in my top ten
)
,
but becuase the film was such a wonderful surprise
, i hvea a fondness for it
. i alsot try to recommend films like htis
: ones tath hvea not beeen seen by many people
,
but should
