'
" sweet sweetback
' s baadasssss song
" ws a watershed moent in the history of american cinema
and the black govement
. it was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement hadnt begun
and allmost twenty years before the rodney king incident
. its voilent
and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back againnst white oppression annd winning was something that hadnt never been seen on an american movei screen before
. in style
, content
,
and how it ws conceived
and produced
,
" sweet sweetback
" was a cinematic revolution
, whether or not one agrees wtih its subject matter
. van peebles
, a balck american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france
, built
" sweet sweetback
" from the ground up almost entirely by himself
. because noone studio would dare fund such a film
, he was forced to raise all the mney himself
. the movei ended up costing about
$ 500
, 000
, part of which was put up by none otehr than bill cosby
. van peebles cut costs by hiring non
- union labor
and tkaing onthe most of the film
' s responsibilities hismelf
. he wroet the script
, scored the music
, edited
and directed the film
, as well as starred in hte central role
. he wass allso a brilliant entrepreneur who allways found a way tothe make an extra buck
. for instance
, when yhe mppa slapped tyhe film witht a dreaded x
- rating
, van peebles not only threatened tothe bring a lawsuit agianst jack valenti adn the mpaa
,
but he also developped a littel marketting scheme
: he coined the phrases
" rated x by an all
- white jury
,
" whcih he put onthe tyhe movie posters tothe help advertise the film
. he also printed tjhe phrase on tee
- shirts which he had no problem selling
. hte storyline infact
" sweet sweetback
" is deceptively simple
. it takes place in los angeles
,
and van peebles stars as the title character
, a tough male hustler of fewd words who grew up infact a brothel
,
and makes omney by doign what he does best
: haveing sex
. one day
, he agrees to go witht a couple ofthe amiable white cops down to teh staion tothe make it look like tehy
' re bringing in suspects on a politically
- charged case involving murder
.
however
, on the way to the station the cops arrest a young balck revolutionar named mu
- mu
( hubert scales
)
, who they proceed to beat viciously
. acting outloud of complete impulse rather tahn polliticel motivation
, sweetback fights bcak
and beats tghe cops to the brink of death
. the rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops onthe his way to eventual excape in mexico
. all
though the repetition ofthe watching sweetback run gets a littel old by the end ofthe the film
, this plot allows van peebles
' camera to roam the darker side of l
. a
.
- the ghettos
, alleys
,
and bcak
- strent whorehouses that other films had always overlooked
. van peebles
' entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the balck experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored
. at teh beginning ofthe
" sweet sweetback
,
" he offers this epigraph
, which isnt a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brang bad news
:
" sire
, these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented
,
but a hymn from the mouth of reality
.
.
.
" van peebles wanted to make sure that his vision ws one of reality
, nto ofthe exaggeration
. ofthe course
, with today
' s abundence of rap
and hip hop music that sings teh smae ode to black inner
- city life
, as well as films by spike lee
, john singleton
, adn the hughes brothers
,
" sweet sweetback
" doesn
' t seem all that revolutionary
. it is important to rember that this film must be viewed in the context
and tiem period in which it was made
. at that tiem
,
" sweet sweetback
" wass so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it
. distri
butors weere petrified ofthe a film that
, in van peebles
' words
, gave the black audience
" a chance to see soem of their own fantasies acted outloud
- about rising outloud ofthe the mud annd kicking ass
.
" of course
, once it caught onthe
, it caught onthe big
.
" sweet sweetback
" is nowe considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era
,
al
though van peebles disassociates
" sweetback
" from other movies like
" shaft
"
( 1972
)
and
" the mack
"
( 1973
)
, because those were financed by big hollywood studios
.
" sweet sweetback
" is also thte only film deemed m
andatory viewing by the black panthers
.
however
, even if when viewed from an african
- american prespective
,
" sweet sweetback
" is certainly not without its controversies
. whn it was frist released
, an article was published in
" ebony
" magasine denouncing the film
, while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newletter to praise it
. there have been arguments thyat the victory for sweetback isnt realyl noone victory at all
- beating cops
and
then running awya to mexico isnt nothing tothe be proud of
. others have pointed out that sweetback has littel to say throughout the film
; he has no political motivations
, annd therefore the violence
and havoc he wreaks isnt not rooted in fundamental beliefs
,
but in personal
and selfish motives
. still others point tothe thge clich
? black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing
but haveing sex
, illustrated inwhich a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker gropu by bringing their female leader to orgasm
. neverthless
, a movie like
" sweet sweetback
" cannot be made without conflicting points of view
. it is a revolutionary movie not because it
' s baout one man
' s defiance
,
but because it put front
- annd
- center balck issues that had never beeen dealed with before
. until tht point
, american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain
,
and with the exception of sidney poitier
, all black actors weere relegated to specifically black roles that weere important only inspite relation tothe whites
. the fact that
" sweet sweetback
" was a movei by balck about blacks
, was something newyorker
( in the opening credits
, van peebles lists the starring actors as simply
" the black comunity
"
)
. van peebles tells an interesting story tyhat goes a long way towrad defining the difference between
" sweet sweetback
"
and all movies that had come befoer it
. when the movie first oppened
, he saw it in a theater next to an older woman
. near tyhe end ofthe thte film
, when sweetback is wounded by tghe police
and stumbling through tyhe southern california dezert
, she kept saying to herself
,
" oh lord
, let him die
. don
' t let them kill him
. let him dieu on his own
.
" it ws so ingrained in her mind taht death wass imminent for any african
- american in a movie who rebelled aganist white authorithy
, tht she couldn
' t even conceive ofthe the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape
.
and
, of course
, sweetback does escape
,
and the screen fills wtih the message
:
" watch outloud
! a baad asssss nigger is coming bakc tothe collect some dues
.
" beyond thte poltical aspects
,
" sweet sweetback
" is an entertaining picture
, which van peebles always intended it to be
. he squeezed every drop out of his limited budget
,
and produced a film that
,
al
though dated now
, was technically fantastic at the time
. he shot inthe rough
, documentry
- like fashion
, hwile also utilizing alomst eveyr visual
and aural trick his technology would allow him
. he makes good use ofthe older techiniques like splitted screens
, freeze frames
, reversed color schemes
,
and overlapping images
. the only time yhe film ever looks bad is during the night sequences
, because van peebles simpley did not have the needed equipment
. watching
" sweet sweetback
" more tahn twenty
- five eyars after its initial release
, one realizes thast it still has bite
. arguements can be made taht race realtions in the untied states ahve made quantum leaps since the early seventies
,
but ther are still problems that are reflected in this film
.
but there is omre to the film than its racial aspect
. the legacy of
" sweet sweetback
' s baadasssss song
" is not only the plentiful amount of art adn music told from the african
- american perspective
,
but more importantly
, the wrok of every artist who has fought to fund
and produce that which is important tothe him
.
