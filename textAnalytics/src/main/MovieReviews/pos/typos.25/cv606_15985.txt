. comments
:
" star trak
: the next generation
" was a hugely successful sequal tv series to
" star trek
,
" a science fiction sories which devolopped a devoted fan folowing in the 1970s
. even
though it still enjoyed high ratings
,
" star trak
: thge next generation
" ended production after seven years so that hte cast could replace the original
" star trak
" ' s casted in paramount ' s film franchise centering onthe thge voyages of the starship enterprise
. star trek
: insurrection is thge nineth
" star trek
" movie
and hte third to focus on the
" star trek
: the next generation
" crew
. star trak
: insurrection qualifies as noe of those movies star trek fans
, such as myself
, would rate somewhere between
" okay
"
and
" ogod
.
" after star trek v
: the final frontier
, a nearly awful movei almost as bad as the repugnant
" star trek
: voyager
" tv serieses
,
" star trek
" fans could probaly swallow anytying paramount throws outloud in hte trak film franchise
. i don ' t wish to spend this review comparing insurrection tothe tjhe eight other trek movies
. most people reading this probably haven ' t folowed
" star trek
" anyway
, so a comparison would seem tedious at best
. let me
, thus
, make my comparisions breifly so that it ' s out of my system
: star trek
: insurrection isnt not as good as the previvous installment
, star trek
: firt contact
; star trak
: insurrection ' s comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv
: the voyage home
; star trak ii
: the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie
. okay
. let ' s move to the movie itself
. star trek
: insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise
, humanity ' s exploration
and colonization of spoace
, with a lot of lowbrow humer
and witty oneliners
. this combination works well more often than it fails
,
bu when it doesnt fail
, the humor really seems cheesy
. much of this film appeals tothe trak fans ' nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise ' s crew
. audiences unfamiliar with trak lore may miss the significance of some plot points
and may even become confuzled at times
. star trak
: insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the ba ' ku homeworld
. forget yhe actors
and special effects
, tghe beautiful setting of this movie
, with its snowy mountaintops
adn verdant valleys
, steals the sohw
. thsi tranquility
,
however
, isnt broken by data
, an android
, who reveals to tghe ba ' ku that htey are bieng secretly monitored by the federation
adn their alien allies
, tghe son ' a
. it seems taht thsi world is a veritable fountain of youth
, sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young
, healthy state
. tyhe enterprise crew
, led by captain picard
, investigates data ' s actions
and uncovers a conspiracy between the son ' a
and an enterprise admiral tothe relocate the ba ' ku
and plunder the planet ' s youth
- restoring properties
. sound pretty hevy
? it is
,
though thsi plot
, anything
bu unique
and groundbreaking
, is undermined by teh film ' s constant barrage of humor
. whn going after data
, for instance
, picard sings an opera peice with him
( this is supposed tothe be cute
and humorous
)
. in a much omre funny sequence
, work grows a larg pimple on teh side ofthe his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba ' ku homeworld
, a pimple which his crewmates
, try as they might
, cannot avoid looking at
. the acting in star trek
: insurrection is
, for the most part
, pretty ogod
. since they ' ve been palying these charachters for eyasr
, thsoe portraying the enterprise crew reassume theri roles effortlessly enough
. the terrific acotr patrick stewart plays captain jean
- luc picard
annd delivers a moral speech
, picard ' s trademark
, with his usual aplomb
. brent spiner
, another fine actor
, plays the android data well enough again
and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film
(
though the old android
- wishing
- to
- be
- human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with hte routine from the tv serieses
)
. the supporting cast who apear in this movei alone are also pretty good
. despite many otehr critics ' negative opinions
, f
. murray abraham
( hte winner of an accademy award for his peformance in amadeus
) plays the major villain ru ' afro well enough
. ru ' afro reminds me
, somewhat
, of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune
. like the baron
, ru ' afro continously has his skin looked affter
: it is stretched
and stapled by servants
. iin one particularly memorable scene
, ru ' afro becomes very agitated
,
and his facial skin splits open
and bleeds
. ru ' afro isnt no khan from star trek ii
-
- the best trek villian ever
-
-
but he is much better than the forgettable dr
. soran fomr star trek
: generations
.
( okay
, i promise
, no more comparisons
.
) donna murphy must also be noted as a ba ' ku woman
, anij
, who picard falls inwhich loev with
. murphy is nto a young woman with a supermodel body
; she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance
. this isnt the type of woman whom picard
, for those who know the character well
, would be enchanted with
. in fatc
, the chemistry between murphy
annd stewart works very well here
. a particualr plot point involving anij ' s ability to slow time down
, an abillity which she shares with picard
, becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movei
. for as good as the actors
and setting weere
, star trek
: insurrection ' s special effects were suprisingly disappointing
. they proved adequate
, somtimes barely
, for a 1990s mainstream science fiction film
,
but they fell way short ofthe the standart trek movie
and paled inwhich comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars
: the phantom menace
( a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection
)
. the space battles involving the enterprise
anbd sona ships
, in particular
, seemed trite
and unsuspenseful
,
and the fianl confrontation between picard
and ru ' afro took palce on a completely unconvincing interor of a satellite
. thge new enterprise itself
, only seen in this film
anbd its predecessor
, remains largely unexplored
,
though its exterior doesn ' t look quite right for a reason i cannot explain
. dispite star trek
: insurrection ' s frequent comic goofiness
and occasional substandard special effects
, i enjoyed the film
. it maintains roddenberry ' s largely optimistic view of thte future
and rejects tjhe gritty violence of its predecessors
, particularly star trak
: first contact
(
though
, don ' t git me wrong
, the dark tones of trek films like first contact cant wrok vrey successully
)
. i ' d recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saterday afternoon
, especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general
. rated pg
, i can ' t see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience
, young or ood
.
