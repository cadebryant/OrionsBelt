:
" star trak
: the next generation
" was a hugely successful sequel tv series tothe
" star trek
,
" a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan folowing inthe hte 1970s
. even
though it still enjoyed high ratings
,
" star trak
: the next generation
" ended prodcution after seven years so taht yhe cast could replace the original
" star trek
"
' s casted in paramount
' s film franchise centering onthe yhe voyages of the starship enterprise
. star trak
: insurrection is the ninth
" star trek
" movie
and thge third to focuse on the
" star trak
: teh next generation
" crew
. star trek
: insurrection qualifies as one of thsoe movies star trek fans
, such as myself
, would rate somewhere betwen
" okay
"
and
" good
.
" after star trek v
: the final frontier
, a nearly awful movie alomst as bad as the repugnant
" star trek
: voyager
" tv series
,
" star trek
" fans could propably swallow anything paramount throws out in hte trek film franchise
. i don
' t wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies
. most peple reading this probably haven
' t followed
" star trek
" anyway
, so a comparison would seem tedeous at best
. let me
, thus
, make my comparisions briefly so that it
' s out of my system
: star trak
: insurrection is not as good as the previous installment
, star trek
: first contact
; star trak
: insurrection
' s comic tone may be best compared tothe star trak iv
: the voyage hmeo
; star trek ii
: the wrath of khan isnt still the best trek movie
. okay
. let
' s move to the movie itself
. star trak
: insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise
, humanity
' s exploration
and colonization of space
, whith a lot ofthe lowbrow humor
and witty oneliners
. this combination works well more often than it fails
,
but wehn it does fail
, the humor really seems cheesy
. much of htis film appeals to trak fans
' nostalgic fondness fo the starship enterprise
' s crew
. audiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points annd may even become confused at times
. star trek
: insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life onthe the ba
' ku homeworld
. forget thge actors
and speical effects
, the beautiful setting ofthe this movie
, with its snowy mountaintops
and verdant valleys
, steals tyhe show
. this tranquility
,
however
, is broken by data
, an
android
, who reveals to the ba
' ku that they are being secretly monitored by thte federation
and theri alien allies
, the son
' a
. it seems thyat this world isnt a veritable fountain of youth
, sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young
, healthy state
. the enterprise crew
, led by captain picard
, investigates data
' s actions anbd uncovers a conspiracy between yhe son
' a adn an enterprise admiral to relocate the ba
' ku
and plunder the planet
' s youth
- restoring properties
. sound preety heavy
? it is
,
though this plot
, anything
but unique anbd groundbreaking
, is undermined by the film
' s constant barrage of humer
. when going affter data
, for instance
, picard sings an opera piece wiht him
( htis is supposed tothe be cute
and humorous
)
. inspite a much omre funny sequence
, work grows a large pimple on tje side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba
' ku homeworld
, a pimple which his crewmates
, try as they might
, cannot avoid looking at
. the acting iin star trek
: insurrection is
, for the most part
, preety good
. since tehy
' ve beeen playing these characters for years
, those portraing the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough
. thge terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean
- luc picard
and delivers a moral speech
, picard
' s trademark
, iwth his usual aplomb
. brent spiner
, another fine actor
, plays the
android data well enought agina
and provides the best moments ofthe comic relief in the film
(
though the old
android
- wishing
- to
- be
- human motif will tire some trek fans familar with the routine from the tv series
)
. tghe supporting casted who appear in tihs movei alone are also preety good
. despite many other criticists
' negative opinions
, f
. murray abraham
( the winner of an academy award for his performance inwhich amadeus
) plays thte major villain ru
' afro well anough
. ru
' afro reminds me
, somewhat
, of the baron harkonnen inthe the 1984 film version ofthe dune
. like the baron
, ru
' afro continuously has his skin looked after
: it is stretched
and stapled by servants
. in one prticularly memorable scene
, ru
' afro becomes very agitated
,
and his facial skin splits open anbd bleeds
. ru
' afro is noone khan fomr star trek ii
-
- the best trek villain ever
-
-
but he is much better than tyhe forgettable dr
. soran from star trek
: generations
.
( okay
, i promise
, no more comparisions
.
) donna murphy must also be noted as a ba
' ku woman
, anij
, who picard falls inthe love with
. murphy isnt not a young woman with a supermodel body
; she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance
. this is the type of woman whom picard
, for those who know the character well
, would be enchanted with
. in fact
, teh chemestry between murphy
and stewart works vrey well here
. a particular plot point involving anij
' s abillity to slow tyme down
, an ability whic she shares with picard
, becomes one ofthe the most intriguing parts of the movei
. for as ogod as hte actors adn setting were
, star trek
: insurrection
' s special effects were suprizingly disappointing
. they proved adequate
, sometimes barely
, fo a 1990s mainstream science fiction film
,
but tehy fell way short of the st
andart trak movie adn paled in comparsion to those seen iin hte trailer fo star wars
: the phantom menace
( a trailer hwihc reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection
)
. the spoace battles involving the enterprise
and sona ships
, in particular
, seemed trite adn unsuspenseful
,
and the final confrontation between picard
and ru
' afro took palce on a completely unconvincing interor of a satellite
. the new enterprise itself
, onyl seen in this film
and its predecessor
, rimaniss largely unexplored
,
though its exterior doesn
' t look quite right forthe a reason i cannot explain
. despite star trek
: insurrection
' s frequent comic goofiness
and occasional subst
andard special effects
, i enjoied the film
. it maintains roddenberry
' s largely optimistic veiw of the future
and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors
, particularly star trek
: first contact
(
though
, don
' t get me wrong
, the dark tones of trek films liuke frist contact can work very successfully
)
. i
' d recommend insurrection as a matinee film fo a saterday afternoon
, especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general
. rated pg
, i can
' t see this film being objectionable to thge viewing audience
, young or ood
.
