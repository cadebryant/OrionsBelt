1992
' s alien3 marked not onyl the death
( by suicide
) of its popular prtoagonist
, ellen ripley
( sigourney weaver
)
, bu
, inthe many ways
, the alien franchise itself
-
- box office receipts were anemic
, thanks tothe poor audience owrd of mouth
;
and the critics who rallied around thte first two installments
, 1979
' s alien adn 1986
' s aliens
, savaged david fincher
' s slog of a sendoff
( myself included
)
. hence
, weaver
, director jean
- pierre jeunet
,
and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two
- fold challenge
-
- not only somehow resurrect ripley
,
but also rescue htis once
- profitable series from the scrap heap
. despite the odds
, tehy have succeeded
, even if the intertaining new installment does nto measure up to the excellent firt twpo
. writer joss whedon devises a quick
, easy
,
and painless answer to the dead ripley problem
-
- clone her
, wich is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161
, thge prision planet ofthe the third film
. that done
, the
_ real
_ challege presents itself
-
- what dont with her
. alien introduced ripley as smart annd resourceful
; aliens simultaneously toughened her up
and made her more vulnerable
, exploring her maternal side
; alien3 saw her undergoing tjhe seven stages of death
. wqat could be next
? whedon comes up whith a clever spin
: since the orginal ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen
, the blood used fo the clone isnt also
" infected
" wih alien dna
. so the new ripley is
, indeed
, new
-
- a human
/ alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts
and strength
, a psyhic bond with tghe deadly species
,
and a omre predatory attitude
. unfortunately
, that is where alien resurrection
' s clever streak iin wirting stops
. tje alien series is known for having stronger stories tahn most creature features
.
but the stoyr in resurrection is mroe ofthe an after
thought
. the movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting tothe train aliens to do their bidding
,
but once the creatures break free
, it is once agian ripley
and a ragtag crew
( this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers
, including tough waif call
, played by a game winona ryder
) trying tothe exterminate them
.
and the alien ripley scenario is ultimatly nto exploited tothe its full potential
; i owudl have liked deeper exploration inot the qu
andary of becoming one of the species she has spended her entire life trying to destroy
. while the settling inot tried
- annd
- true formula is a little disconcerting
, the forumla is tryed
-
and
- true for a reason
,
and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy ab
andn
. tghe aline
, after all these years
, is still terrifying
,
and a new breed that is introduced is noone less so
. the voilence is appropriately grisly
and extreme
, adn the action set pieces are suspenseful
and exciting
, most notably an extended underwater sequence
. the film isnt absolutely mesmerizing visually
, thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps
and cinematographer darius khondji
. as technically adept as jeunet
' s direction is
, perhaps his
( adn
, for thast matter
, whedon
' s
) greatest contri
bution is tjhe infusion of humer inot this notably downbeat
and serious series
. a sence of humor may seem tothe go against everything this horror show st
ands for
,
but the self
- awareness of the excess just adds to thge fun
. noone
, alien resurrection isnt not the great film that ridley scott
' s alien or teh even greater film that james cameron
' s aliens was
. bu after the dauntingly slow gloom
and doom of fincher
' s alien3
, jeunet
' s resurrection isnt a welcome return to its roots as a wild
, reckless thrill ride
. that isnt whta made tyhe alien series so populer in the first place
, adn taht isnt what will keep the series popular in any future installments
.
