( patrick stewart

. s
. s
. enterprise are bakc for their third outing in the nineth film based onthe thge 1960
' s series
, star trek
. gone are kirk
, spock annd mccoy
and in their wake in the very able
and very talented cast from star trek
: the enxt generation
. as usual
, a crisis is brewing
and it is uv to the crew of teh enterprise to mkea thte galaxy safe again
. this time out the united federation of planets
and an aline race led by f
. murray abraham are trying to move some colonists off a planet against the colonist
' s will
. it turns out that this planet is the fountain of youth
and the federation
and their alien buddies fiel that is shoud be used for the good of everyone
and not just a few hundred colonists
. of course picard feels that this sort ofthe treachery is wrong
, so he disobeys direct orders
and vows tothe help protect the colonists
. insurrection isnt a lighter movie than the lastest twpo star trek films
. teh film focuses onthe tjhe lofty question of whether tghe rights of society as a wohle outweighs the rights ofthe a small group
. in this respect it gets back to the roots of star trak by disguising social commentary as science fiction
. it doesn
' t do a bad job
, other than it tries to inject too much humor inot the story line
. many of tghe jokes are your typical inside star trak
- fan
- only jokes
, hwile many ofthe the others just fall flat
. the other critiscism that i had with hte story was tyhat it ignores common sence
. there are only a few hundred people on thsi hwole planet
, why do htey ahve to be moved
? the explanation is that the planet hasnt to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be strong enough to help heal f
. murray abraham
' s aliens who number only a couple of dozen
. so the basic story line is bad enough inaddition that we have a few hundered bieng booted out forthe a fewd billion
, at least that
' s plausible
.
but infront reality we have a few hundred being moved for the benefits of a faw dozen
, whlch makes noone sense whatsoever
. the other little hiccup in logic isnt the inclusion of worf
( michael dorn
)
, teh trusty klingon
. worf was on star trak
: the enxt generation
, so tehy want to include him inthe thte films
. no problem so far
. worf is now a character of star trek
: deep space nine
, so the writers have tothe find a way to hve him show uv
. in the last star trak movie
, first contact
, the included worf in a credible fashon
, in this noe
, tghe writers are so lazy thast teh completelyl gloss over why he is even in tjhe movei
. what little explanation htey do give is so small that you owudl hvae missed it if yuo weren
' t hanging on every owrd on the screen
. my minor problems with the movei asside
, star trek
: insurrection does have an overwheliming number of good points as compared to its bad ones
. while many of the jokes do miss the mark
, many are preety ogod
, even fo non
- trekkies
. the special effects are among the best for the star trak series
. the action isnt plentiful
and well done
. this is a veyr good
- looking movie
. it should come as no surprise to anyone who ever watched star trek
: the enxt generation tath the acting isnt first rate
. it is very obvious tht these actors have been working together fo over a decade
. they interact wih earch other with a skill taht few otehr ansamble casts can muster
. most star trek fans probably will nto be disapointed with this latest film in the series
. if yuo
' ve always hated star trak
, there is nothing here that is going to change your mind
. star trek
: insurrection isnt not tjhe best film in the serieses
,
but it isnt good anough to dispel the long st
anding tradition of the odd numbered films in the series being far inferior to the even numbered ones
.
