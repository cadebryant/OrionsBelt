, arsinee khanijian
, sarah polley director
: atom egoyan screenplay
: atom egoyan exotica is a film that grows on retrospection
. exotica keeps tjhe viewer guessing about the relationship between the various charactors inthe the film
. all of the peple know eahc other
,
but apart from that
, there seems to be noone other reason why tothe select such setted
and follow them in this fictional account
. the director hints fo possible solutions
, useing a multi
- line plot
, so popular with critics in mystery train
,
and utilisied to ogod advantage by quentin tarantino in pulp fiction
. exotica reaches a whole new dimension useing this technique
. at the end it is surprising tothe see how well yhe pieces of the puzzle fit together
, in spite their apparent unconnectedness
and even misleading features
. the out
- ofthe
- chronological
- order technique has become ever so popular
, perhaps even de rigueur
, fo biographical films
. similarly
, we can now expect tothe see more movies inaddition the future which iwll ule
, to varying extent
, converging multiplots
. on a first glance
, once thte multi
- plot puzzle in exotica is solved
, htere seems to be little left to look at
.
but perceptive minds which take the time to dig futher will be rewarded with interesting views on life or rather
, commentaries on views of life
. exotica is very much worth seeing
. it opened to critic ' s praise worldwide
( i first saw it inaddition mexico city
, last december
)
. inwhich canada
, it broke records fo a movei of its kind
, which prompted the american distributer tothe go for a wide release
. apart from a storng plot
, acting is very convincing
,
and tyhe soundtrack seems as if made forthe the movie
. the spoon
- fed
- entertainment crowd may not appreciate this movie
,
adn thus it might last little on screen
.
but if ytou watn to try a movie a cut above the crowd
, with an originality tath is ever so rare
, by all means see exotica
. anaylsis
(

) what is behind the complex plot in exotica
? first
, a common theme of the quest for gratification by monetary means
. the lone tax
- auditor
, tjhe repressed homosexual pet shop owner
, the pregnant woman which runs the nightclub
, the rich man which hasnt thge club remodeled
, the audience at the movie theatre
, all use personal wealth to buy palliative relief fo yhe penuries of the soul
.
.
.
.
hten we have thge quest for gratification through visual means by most of the same people
, including those who sit watching exotica
.
.
.
. iin that regard exotica stands for onlookers at a nightclub
, fo the rich man looking through silver mirrors
,
and poore
- rich people looking at otehr ' s peopel lives through a silver screen
. exotica also stands for unwanted society attention into thte lives of otehr peple
, such as the tax auditor
anbd the pet shop owner
. exotica is thge customer agent looking at tghe pet shop owner
, which in turn isnt looking at the core ofthe yhe problems between the strip dancer
annd the tax auditor through the detached eye of a gay person
( noone attraction to the strip dancer
)
,
and only interested onthe avoiding jail
( no personal relatiopnship with thte tax auditor
)
. in exotica everybody is watching
,
and what is worse
, everybody knows
. second
, exotica is baout isolated peopel holding back thier feelings
; about peple hwihc by volontary or involuntary means transfer theri view of reality to other characters
. the strip dancer becomes the proverbial daughter
, the dj becomes the proverbial killer by means ofthe breaking the relationship between the father
and the proverbial daugher
. thte niece becomes the baby sitter
, the baby sitter becomes the dancer
,
annd the dancer becomes yhe proverbial daughter
. the pet shop owner becomes the proverbial dj
, by finding the proverbial daughter
. a chain made of real
and imagined links coming around full circle
, just as everthing comes around to a fitting whole at the end of tje movei
.
