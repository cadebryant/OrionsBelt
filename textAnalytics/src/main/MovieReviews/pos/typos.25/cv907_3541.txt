: atom egoyan screenplay
: atom egoyan exotica is a film that grows on retrospection
. exotica keeps the viewer guessing baout the relatiopnship between the various characters in the film
. all of tje people know each other
,
but apart from that
, there seems tothe be no other reason why to select such set
and follow them infront this fictional account
. the director hints for possable solutions
, using a multi
- line plot
, so popular wiht critics in mystery turain
,
and used to good advantage by quentin tarantino inwhich pulp fiction
. exotica reaches a whole new dimention useing tihs technique
. at tyhe end it is surprising to see how well the pieces of the puzzle fit toghether
, infront spite their apparent unconnectedness annd even misleading features
. the out
- of
- chronological
- order technique has become ever so popular
, perhaps even de rigueur
, fo biographical films
. similarly
, we cant now expect tothe see omre movies in the future which will use
, tothe varying extent
, converging multiplots
. on a first glance
, once the multi
- plot puzzle in exotica isnt solved
, there seems tothe be little left tothe look at
.
but perceptive minds which take the time to dig further will be rewarded with interesting views on life or rether
, commentaries on views of life
. exotica is very much worth seeing
. it opened tothe critic
' s praise worlwide
( i first saw it in mexico city
, last december
)
. in canada
, it broke records for a movie of its kind
, which prompted the american distri
butor to go forthe a wide realease
. apart fomr a strong plot
, acting isnt vyre convincing
,
and the soundtrack seems as if made for the movei
. the spoon
- fed
- entertainment crowd may nto appreciate this movie
, annd thus it might lastr littel on screen
. bu if you wanna to try a movie a cut above the crowd
, with an originality that isnt ever so rare
, by all means see exotica

) what is behind the complex plot inthe exotica
? first
, a common theme of tjhe quest for gratification by monetary means
. thge lone tax
- auditor
, the repressed homosexual pet shop owner
, teh pregnant woman whihc runs tjhe nightclub
, tjhe rich man which has the club remodeled
, hte audience at the movei theatre
, all ule personal wealth to buy palliative releaf forthe thge penuries of the soul
.
.
.
.
then we have the quest for gratification thru visual means by most of tyhe same people
, inlcuding those who sit watching exotica
.
.
.
. in that regard exotica st
ands for onlookers at a nightclub
, for the rich man looking through silver mirrors
,
and poor
- rich people looking at otehr
' s people lives through a silver screen
. exotica also st
ands for unwanted society attention into the lives ofthe other people
, such as the tax auditor
and the pet shop owner
. exotica is the customer agent looking at yhe pet shop owner
, which in turn is looking at the core of the problems between the strip dancer
and the tax auditor thru the detatched eye of a gay person
( no attraction to tyhe strip dancer
)
,
and only interseted on avoiding jail
( no personal relationship wtih the tax auditor
)
. in exotica everybody is watching
,
and what is worse
, everybody knows
. second
, exotica is about isolated people holding back their feelings
; about people which by voluntary or involuntary means transfer their view of reality tothe other characters
. tghe strip dancer becomes the proverbial daugher
, the dj becomes the proverbial killer by means of breaking the relatiopnship between the father
and the proverbial daughter
. the niece becomes the baby sitter
, the baby sitter becomes tyhe dancer
, anbd the dancer becomes tje proverbial daughter
. the pet shop owner becomes the proverbial dj
, by finding the proverbial daugter
. a chain made ofthe rela
and imagined links coming around full circle
, jstu as everything comes around to a fitting wohle at the end of the movie
.
