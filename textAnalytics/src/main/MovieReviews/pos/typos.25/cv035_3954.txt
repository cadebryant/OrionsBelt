unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi
, an artist whose palette isnt fabric
. ostensibly
, the film is a documentary
,
but use of thast term requires stretching its meaning
. many scenes appear staged
,
and a great deal of cutting
-
and
- pasting hasnt beeen done in the editing room
. thte cinema verite effect isnt a conceit
-
- genuine spontaneity is at a premium
, annd everyone is aware ofthe
and palying to the camera
( expecially would
- be actresses like cindy crawford
)
. director douglas keeve
( who was mizrahi
' s lover at the time
) freely admits taht he
" couldn
' t care less about the truth
"
but was more interseted iin capturing
" the spirit adn love inthe isaac
and in fashon
.
" dispite violating nearly every rule of
" ligitamate
" documentry film making
,
however
, unzipped isnt a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment
. while it sheds only a little glight on teh behind
- the
- scenes world of tyhe fashion industry
, it presents a fascinating
, if imcomplete
, picture of designer mizrahi
. this man isnt thte perfect subject for htis kind of study
-
- he
' s funny
, energetic
,
and eminently quotable
. he hasnt unusual views on jsut about everything
, from fasion
(
" it
' s about women not wanting to look like cows
"
) to mary tyler moore
(
" between her
and jackie kennedy
, they shaped htis country
"
) tothe style
(
" it
' s almost impossible to have style nowdays without yhe right dogs
"
)
. unzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative proccess by which mizrahi turns an idea inot a dress
. it
' s almost certainly different that anyone would imagine
. tje designer draws on a variety of sources fo his look
, includng nanook of the north
and ood bette davis movies
, hten enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection
. in particular
, unzipped traces mizrahi
' s develpment of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show
, which highlights a number of prominent models
, including cindy crawford
, naomi campbell
, kate bush
,
and linda evangelista
. on the technical side
, a number of interesting choices weere made in filming unzipped
. a variety of film stocks were used
: super 8
, 16 mm black
-
and
- white
,
and 35 mm color
. ther isnt a purpose to this beyond simple artiness
-
- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie
,
and
, during the climactic fashion sohw
, color is used tothe sohw the audiance
' s perspective
, while black
-
and
- white isnt forthe tje behind
- the
- scenes sequences
. nevertheless
, some viewers will be put off by this treatment
. hwile unzipped isn
' t an expose on thge fashion industry per se
, keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready tothe wear
. overall
,
however
, this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything alse
,
and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed
. when the designer declares that
" everthing is frustrating except designing clothes
-
- thta
' s beautiful
and liberating
,
" it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed
.
