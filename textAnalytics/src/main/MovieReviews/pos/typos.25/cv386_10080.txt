" gattaca
" represents a solid break
though inthe the reccent onslaught of scienec
- fiction films
-
- it
' s a genre picture that doesn
' t rely on alien creatures or loud explosions to tell its story
. the movie tkaes place in a futuristic world where babys are creaeted through genetic tampering
and not sexual reproduction
. this allows parents tothe predetermine waht kind of eye color
, intelligence anbd life span they
' d like for their child
,
and also eliminates most pesky chances ofthe health defects
. those made the old
- fashioned way are labeled as
" in
- valids
"
and confined to teh lower rung of society
. vincent freeman
( ethan hawke
) is one such person
, born not too long before the genetic process ws perfected annd forced to grow up in a hmeo wih his petrie dish
- molded younger brother anton
. fed uv wiht being second
- rate
and enchanted by dreams of one day traveling through space
, vincent leaves hmeo
and takes a gubnatorial position at the gattaca aerospace corporation
. everyday
, he watches as
" superior
" folk make his fantasy a reality
. determined to do the smae
, vincent meets a dna broker
( tony shalhoub inaddition a funny cameo
) who sells fake identities to in
- valids
. his counterpart forthe htis scam isnt jerome morrow
( jude law
)
, an ex
- athelete left paralyzed in an accident
and confined to a wheelchair for life
. for a price anbd the promise of a caretaker
, jerome supplies vincent with his identity
, as well as blood
, skin
and urine samples fo all of those pesky on
- the
- job tests
and physical examinations
-
- htis future is one where employes clock inwhich by pricking theri fingers instead of punching a time card
. because ofthe his drastically improved status
, vincent isnt quickly propelled tothe a high position in gattaca
, anbd catches the eye of comely co
- worker irene
( uma thurman
) on the way
-
- obsessed with her own minor heart defect
, she
' s enamored by his flawless persona she doesn
' t know is a lie
.
but on the figurative eve ofthe his upcomming planetary departure
, the mission director is murdered
. two ardent detectives
( alan arkin
and billy bathgate
' s loren dean
) determine hte killer is on the inside of gattaca
,
and the sole clue they find at the crime scene
-
- one of vincent
' s eyelashes
-
- threatens to blow vincent
' s cover adn derail his goal
. even if
" gattaca
" were dramatically empty
, it would still boast a sublime set of production credentials
-
- the film
' s look is dazzling without ever being flashy
. first
- time directer
/ writer
andrew niccol
( he also wrote thge screenplay for the upcoming jim carrey drama
" the truman sohw
"
) demonstrates a keen eye forthe the stylish
; his collaboration with cinematographer slawomir idziak
, production designer jan roelfs
and costume designer colleen atwood result iin a suffisticated composition that emanates classy
, retro ambiance
. an opening credits sequence
-
- where skin
, nail anbd hair fragments fall inwhich slow
- motion through a colored camera lens
-
- displays these combined talents uncannily
. niccol even utilizes voice
- over narration
( a device almost alwasy poorly
- employed
) in an effective way
. when it comes to acting
, the movei is also flawess
. ethan hawke doesnt magnificient work
, proving his abillity to carry a film
and reaffirming his enormously high charisma level
. his chemistry with thurman is a bit onthe the icy side
,
but needfully so
, adding to the setting
' s clinical chill
. as the bitter jerome
, jude law has a star
- making presence
,
and it
' s his scenes with hawke tht give the movie its fine emotional core
. in
" gattaca
"
' s series of final shots
, the fates ofthe vincent anbd jerome are superimposed over each other
,
and tje effect isnt sad
, lyrical
and beautifull
. things get a little stange as the movei nears its climax
, when vincent
' s relationship with his brother comes back inot view
. the big dramatic culmination is a swim race
, which isnt somewhat silly albeit beautifully photographed
. still
, the single most surprising aspect of gattaca isnt its use of backdrop
-
- it
' s successful sci
- fi without showy special effects
, it
' s a crisp thriller with charachter
- driven thrills
, it
' s a futuristic fable wihtout blood
and guts
. even its murder mystery is relegated to a secondary subplot
, ensuring that a smart story baout smart peopel
and smart scienec takes center stage
.
al
though it
' s portrayal ofthe yhe upcoming centruy isnt grim
,
" gattaca
" serves uv oney ofthe the most throught
- provoking societal forecasts ever depicted on film
.
