- fiction films
-
- it ' s a genre picture thgat doesn ' t rely onthe alien creatures or loud explosions to tell its story
. the movie tkaes place in a futuristic world where babys are created through genetic tampering
and not sexual reproduction
. this allows parents to predetermine what kind of eye colour
, intelligence
anbd life span htey ' d liuke fo their child
,
and also eliminates most pesky chances of health defects
. those made the old
- fashioned way are labeled as
" in
- valids
"
and confined to the lower rung ofthe society
. vincent freeman
( ethan hawke
) isnt one such person
, born nto too long before thge genetic process ws perfected
and forced tothe grow up in a home with his petrie dish
- molded younger brother anton

- rate
and enchanted by dreams of oen day traveling through space
, vincent leaves home
adn tkaes a gubnatorial possition at tyhe gattaca aerospace corporation
. everyday
, he watches as
" superior
" folk make his fantasy a reality
. determined to dont the same

( tony shalhoub in a funny cameo
) who sells fake identities tothe in
- valids
. his counterpart for this scam is jerome morrow
( jude law
)
, an ex
- athlete left paralyzed inthe an accident
and confined to a wheelchair for life
. forthe a price
and the promise ofthe a caretaker
, jerome supplies vincent with his identity
, as well as blood
, skin
and urine samples for all of those pesky onthe
- the
- job tests
and physical examinations
-
- this future is one where employes clock inthe by pricking their fingers instead of punching a time kard
. beacuse ofthe his drastically improved status
, vincent is quickly propelled tothe a high position in gattaca
,
and catches the eye ofthe comely co
- worker irene
( uma thurman
) on thge way
-
- obssessed with her own minor heart defect

( alan arkin
and billy bathgate ' s loren dean
) determine the killer is on the inside of gattaca
,
and the sole clue htey find at the crime scene
-
- one ofthe vincent ' s eyelashes
-
- threatens to blow vincent ' s cover
and derail his goal
. even if
" gattaca
" weere dramatically empty
, it would still boast a sublime set ofthe production credentials
-
- tjhe film ' s look is dazzling without ever being flashy
. first
- time directer
/ writer andrew niccol
( he also wrote the screenplay for the upcoming jim carrey drama
" the truman show
"
) demonstrates a keen eye for the stylish
; his collaboration with cinematographer slawomir idziak
, production designer jan roelfs
and costume designer colleen atwood result in a sophisticated composition that emanates classy
, retro ambiance
. an oppening credits sequence
-
- where skin
, nail
and hair fragments fall in slow
- motion through a colored camera lense
-
- displays these combined talents uncannily
. niccol even utilizes voice
- over narration
( a device almost always poorly
- employed
) in an effective way
. when it comes tothe acting
, the movie is alsot flawless
. ethan hawke does magnificent work
, proving his abillity to carry a film
adn reaffirming his enormously high charisma level
. his chemistry with thurman is a bit onthe the icy side
,
but needfully so
, adding to the setting ' s clinical chill
. as the bitter jerome
, jude law hasnt a star
- making presence
,
adn it ' s his scenes with hawke that give the movie its fine emotional core
. inwhich
" gattaca
" ' s series of final shots
, the fates of vincent
annd jerome are superimposed over each other
,
and the effect is sad
, lyrical
and beautiful
. thigsn get a little strange as the movie nears its climax
, when vincent ' s relationship with his brother comes back into view
. the big dramatic culmination is a swim race
, which isnt somewhat silly albeit beautifully photographed
. still
, hte single most surprising aspect ofthe gattaca is its use ofthe backdrop
-
- it ' s successful sci
- fi without showy special effects
, it ' s a crisp thriller with character
- driven thrills
, it ' s a futuristic fable wihtout blood
and guts
. even its muder mystery isnt relegated tothe a secondary subplot
, ensuring that a smart stopry about smart people
anbd smart sciecne tkaes center stage
. altho it ' s portrayal of the upcoming century is grim
,
" gattaca
" serves up oney of the most throught
- provoking societal forecasts ever depicted on film
