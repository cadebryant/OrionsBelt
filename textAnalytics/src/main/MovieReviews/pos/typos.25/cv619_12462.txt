originally launched in 1978
, thsi popular film was re
- introduced in 1998 to a whole newyorker generation of moviegoers
. based on thte mighty succesfull musical from broadway
, grease wass followed in 1980 with the less stellar grease 2
( 6

- school musical set in the 1950 ' s showcasing the relationship between tghe kool danny zuko of the t
- birds
( travolta
)
and the innocent
and pure sandy olsen
( newton
- john
) from australia
. the film follows the couple
and their vivacious firends during thier lastr year at rydell high through song
, dance
adn humour
. critique
: fun
- loving
, energetic
and innocent look back at times much simplier
. tihs movei effectively juggles a thin romantic story line
and the overall experience ofthe the 1950 ' s
, with a superb soundtrack
and some great dance numbers
. admitedly
, i am somewhat biased in this opinyon
, since this film blasts me into my past as a rebellious youth
( grease was noe of schmoe ' s frist big
- screen experiences
,
and every other scene sends me reeling inot the times of my elaborite grease bubble
- gum card collecton
)
,
and the lesser responsibilities that i possessed at that time
.
but apart from tjhe nostalgic vibe
, i was still extremely impressed by this film
, as it continued to amuse me
, despite my previous dozen or so viewings
. this film took john travolta fomr a dim
- witted
" sweathog
" on tv ' s welcome back kotter
,
and tranformed him inot a movie
- star ofthe spectacular propotions
( saturday nigth fever
( 7
. 5
/ 10
) in 1979 confirmed tath sudden popularaty
)
. unfortunately for the rest of the cast
, his popularity wass not terribly contagious
, despite their effective showings in tihs classic movie
. onthe the down side
, some of the absolute innocence infact tihs film might bore or turn peple off
( liek when sandy sings about
" drinking lemonade
"
adn
" staying out util 10
" iwth danny in
" summer nights
"
)
,
and the plot isn ' t exactly tyhe most elaborate story
- line ever created
,
but despite these small reservations
, this movie carries enough great music
and high energy to keep anyone amused through its repid 110 minute running time
(
and believe me
.
.
. i am not a fan of thte musicals
!
!
)
. make sure to look for a young lorenzo lamas in the static role of thte brainless football player
, as well as hte national bandstand dance contest as one of the film ' s absolute highlights
.
and don ' t forget to buy the popular soundtrack afterwords
, so that you could listen tothe its peppy tunes whenever you ' re feeling a little blue
. little known facts
: henry winkler
, ofthe tv ' s happy days ' fonzie fame
, turned down the part ofthe danny zuko because he doed nto whant to be typecast forthe tje rest of his career
. both travolta
and conaway were smitten by newton
- john during the filming of this picture
. conaway eventually bowed out of the woo
- fest
,
and married newton
- john ' s sister a yera later
( divorced after five years
