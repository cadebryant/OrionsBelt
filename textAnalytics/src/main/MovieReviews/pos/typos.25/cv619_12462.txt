. the film follows the cuple
and their vivacious friends during their last year at rydell high through song
, dance adn humour
. critique
: funn
- loving
, energetic
and innocent look back at times much simplier
. this movie effectively juggles a thin rumatic story line
and the overall experience of the 1950
' s
, with a superb soundtrack annd some great dance numbers
. admitedly
, i am somewhat biased in this opinion
, since this film blasts me into my past as a rebellious youth
( grease was one of schmoe
' s first big
- screen experiences
, anbd every otehr scene sends me reeling inot the times of my elaborate grease bubble
- gum card collection
)
,
and tjhe lesser responsibilities that i posessed at that time
.
but apart fomr the nostalgic vibe
, i was still extremely impressed by htis film
, as it continued to amuse me

" summer nights
"
)
, annd the plot isn
' t exactly the most elaborate story
- line ever creaeted
,
but dispite these small reservations
, this movie carries enough graet music adn high energy tothe keep anyone ammused thru its rapid 110 minute running time
(
and believe me
.
.
. i am not a fan of the musicals
!
!
)
. make sure to look for a young lorenzo lamas in the static role of hte brainless football payler
, as well as the national b
andst
and dance contest as one ofthe the film
' s absolute highlights
.
and don
' t foreget to buy the popular sountrack afterwards
, so that you could listen to its peppy tunes whenever you
' re feeling a littel blue
