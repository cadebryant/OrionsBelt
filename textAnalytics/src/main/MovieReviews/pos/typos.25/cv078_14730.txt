the truman show
( paramount pictures
) running tiem
: 1 hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey anbd ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait
, jim carrey
' s dramtic de
but finaly makes it to tghe big screen
. in case you
' ve been asleep for hte last fewd monthes
, the plot centres on truman burbank
( carrey
) who leads an seamingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven
. his life seems so perfect
,
however
, baceause it
' s controlled by christoff
( harris
) creator of thte truman show
, the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of
. that
' s right
, burbank
' s life is being broadcast live to tghe american publich
,
and seahaven
and all it
' s inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage
. teh film takes the jerry springer format one step too far
.
.
. wiht an idae so different
, it would be easy for the director
and screenwriter tothe dumb it down
and appeal to the lowest common denominator
. luckily
, the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages
,
yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie
. talking of carrey
, he
' s perfect in this movie
, enjoying thte best role in his career
. his charcter is a re
- inforced stanley ipkiss ffrom the mask
( 1994
)
and is completely suited to carrey
' s persona
. he occasionally falls into ace ventura mode
, shrieking
and being silly
,
but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey
. he
' s not completely dramatic like the film promises
, howver
. ed harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff
, tje megalomaniac creator ofthe the show
. quiet
and well spoken
, he burns an image into the viewer
. unfortunately
, he
' s barely in the film
,
and for the first hour dosen
' t appear at all
! also disappointing is natascha mcelhone
' s charcter sylvia
. she plays the role well
,
but her character is sadly underwritten
and is pushed to the sidelines just when thge audience is used tothe her
. the supporting casted isnt excellent
,
and the twon of seahaven looks delightfully perfect
, so perfect it
' s creepy
. the philip glass soundtrack is also superb
,
and isnt used to great effect during thge film
. peter weir keeps the film going
, clearly having funn
. the film isnt far more upbeat tahn his previous films dead poets society annd green card
. all
though it is slightly slow tothe beign iwth
, about half an hour into film the pace really picks up
,
and whn christoff is introduced fully the film is onthe a roll
. sadly
,
though
, the film is practically over when hte film is infront full steam
. also
, concerning the ending
, it isnt slightly too ambiguous
, which was disappointing
. the screenwriter
,
andrew niccol
, who bought us gattaca
( 1997
) delivers an entertaining script
,
and manages to keep yhe plot in trim
. hwile christoff
' s plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly
, they never go over the line
, which would have been easy for niccol to dont
. also
, there
' s some funny gags involving product placement
and the people who watch the show
. overall
, yhe truman show is excellent enteratinment
. certainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces
, it should be viewed by everyone
. it offers something to eveyr memeber ofthe the audience
, adn you would almost certainly not come out disappointed
. overall rating
