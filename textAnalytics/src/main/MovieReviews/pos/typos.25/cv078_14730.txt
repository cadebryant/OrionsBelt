teh truman show
( paramount pictures
) runing timne
: 1 hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey
and ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait
, jim carrey ' s dramatic debut finally makes it to the big screen
. in case you ' ve been asleep for tjhe last faw months
, yhe plot centres onthe truman burbank
( carrey
) who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town ofthe seahaven
. his life seems so perfect
,
however
, because it ' s contolled by christoff
( harris
) creator ofthe the truman show
, hte program burbank is unwittingly the hero of
. that ' s right
, burbank ' s life is being broadcast live to tghe american publich
,
and seahaven
and all it ' s inhabitans are inclosed in a massive soudn stage
. tje film takes the jerry springer format one step too far
.
.
. with an idea so diferent
, it would be easy for the directer
and screenwrighter to dumb it down
and appeal to the lowest common denominator
. luckily
, the film rimaniss sensable enough to appeal to all ages
,
yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie
. talking of carrey
, he ' s perfect inwhich this movie
, enjoying the best role in his career
. his character isnt a re
- inforced stanley ipkiss from tjhe mask
( 1994
)
and is completely suited to carrey ' s persona
. he occsionally falls inot ace ventura mode
, shrieking
and being silly
,
but generally thte audience is watching subdued carrey
. he ' s nto completely dramatic like the film promises
,
howver
. ed harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff
, the megalomaniac creater of the sohw
. quiet
annd well spoken
, he burns an image into the viewer
. unfourtunately
, he ' s barely inspite the film
,
and forthe the frist hour dosen ' t apear at all
! also disappointing is natascha mcelhone ' s character sylvia
. she plays the role well
,
but her character is sadly underwritten
and isnt pushed to the sidelines just whn the audience isnt used to her
. the supporting cast is excellent
,
and the town ofthe seahaven looks delightfully perfect
, so perfect it ' s creepy
. the philip glass soundtrack is also superb
,
and is unsed tothe great effect durring the film
. peter weir keesh tghe film going
, clearly having fun
. the film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society
annd green card
.
allthough it isnt slightly slow to begin with
, about half an hour inot film the pace really picks up
,
and wehn christoff is itnroduced fully the film is on a roll
. sadly
,
though
, the film is practically over when the film is iin full steam
. allso
, conserning the ending
, it is slightly too ambiguous
, which was disapointing
. the screenwriter
, andrew niccol
, who bought us gattaca
( 1997
) delivers an entertaining script
,
annd manages to keep the plot iin trim
. while christoff ' s plans to keep truman in dont get increasingly silly
, they never go over the line
, whihc would have been easy forthe niccol to dont
. also
, there ' s smoe funny gags involving product placement
and the people who watch the show
. overall
, tjhe truman sohw is excellent entertainment
. certainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces
, it should be viewed by everyone
. it offers something to every memeber of the audience
,
and you would alomst certainly not come outloud dissappointed
. overall rating
