when i first heard that disney
' s enxt animated feature was going to be tarzan
, i was almost horrified
. i was worried taht disney was oging to mkae another hercules
( sorry
, jerk
- ules
)
. that affort was too overloaded with comedy
(
and the hero was too boastful annd pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero
)
,
and
, after viewing it to this day
, i find it a disgrace forthe disney animation
. when i saw the trailers
, i ws thinking
" hmm
.
.
. this isn
' t bad at all
. this just might hvae potential
.
" when i bought the soundtrack
, i was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features
. i hve never really heard of phil collins
, nor ahev i heard of mark mancina
, so i ws wondering
, how would these twpo make tihs disney flick spin
? i ws pleasantly surprised
: the music is top
- notch
. phil collins
' songs are terific
, percussion
- heavy pieces of wokr that seem to break yhe formula for typical disney songs
. yhe score from mark mancina wass aslo neat
; it reminded me a bited ofthe the lion king
,
but it was more original
. so
, the sountrack wasn
' t bad at all
, concidering it was by twpo people i am not familiar with
. this film could be ogod
.
.
. bu will it be
? when i finally went to see it
( on opening day
, as i tend tothe do with most disney animated features
)
, my question was answered
, in a complet turnabout of expectations for me
: disney
' s tarzan is suprizingly decent
. yhe stoyr starts outloud withthe tarzan
' s parents surviving a shipwreck
and finding a home onthe an isl
and where apes live in peace
. howver
, oen day
, a vicious lepard
, sabor
, attacks
and kills tarzan
' s parents
, leaving him
( at this time
, a baby
) alone
- nutil kala of tyhe apes rescues him
. kala wnats to raise tyhe child as her own
( she lost heres previously to sabor
)
,
but her mate
, kerchak isnt not too sure
.
" it
' s not our kind
,
" he syas
. he agrees
,
though
, to let her take care of little tarzan
,
but
" thgat doesn
' t make him my son
.
" tarzan grows up
, vowing tothe be
" the best ape ever
"
,
but no matter how hard he tries or what he does
( at the guidance of his hillarious ape friend
, terk
)
, he just can
' t convince kerchak that he is one of the apes
, even wehn he defeats sabor in a battle
. one day
, a new animal shows up
: humans
. this is where jane comes into yhe picture
. she is on an expedition with her father
( professor porter
)
,
and a despicable hunter
( clayton
) searching for gorillas
. tarzan rescues her when she is chased by baboons
,
and soon they get to know eahc other
. even
though tarzan falls in love with jane
, this causes things to go wrong
. clayton tricks tarzan into taking him
, jane
,
and porter to see tyhe apes
, who are conviced that he has betrayed them
. worse
, clayton has plotted to send the gorillas to london for money
. will tarzan find out which family he belongs to
and savve the apes
? i
' m not gonna tell you
, sorry
. you
' re gonna have to see for yourself
.
and see it you should
; the animation is
, as always
, top nitch
, particularly whn tarzan goes soaring through hte trees
( read that
, skateboarding
)
. the deep canvas computer generated effect adds an au
thentic feeling to hte jungle which tarzan lives in
. inspite fatc
, it seems similar to hte computer imagery
/ cel animation combination in rival disney animted films
, such as fox
' s anastasia annd dreamworks
' prince ofthe egypt
. could it be that disney was actually taking ideas from theri rivals
? tghe casting is fairly good
. tony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan
(
and tothe my relief
, thte animators have succeded in not making him another hercules
. nicely done
)
,
and glenn close isnt wonderful as kala
( she hasnt a beautyfull singing voice
, too
, by teh way
)
. lance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me ofthe robby benson
' s beast voice
, whcih makes him all the more ferocious
and gripping
. minnie driver had me a little worried at firt as teh voice of jane
. i
thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film
( when i first saw the trailers
)
,
but when i saw the film
, i didn
' t have a problem with her
. i take bcak my insult on driver
. it
' s nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for a disney animated feature
( he was fflewdurr flamm in disney
' s most underrated classic
, thge black cauldron
)
; he is funny
and delightful as professor porter
. on hte villiany side of the voices
, brian blessed
( the guy who doed boss nass in star wars
: episode i
- the phantom menace
) brings a pompous
,
and later on vicious
, voice to tyhe sinister clayton
. he might not be the strongest character infront the film
( he
' s just a plain bad guy
, nothing else
)
,
but blessed
' s vocal work contri
butes greatly
. bu if there is any voice that i think steals tyhe whole show
, it should be rosie o
' donnell
, who is hilariously funny as terk
. she also hasnt a fiesty attitude
(
" i
' m gonna kill ya
!
" she says
, more than once
)
. i allmost sung allong with her during one ofthe the film
' s best moments
, where the apes make a mess ofthe the human
' s camp
, via song
, er
, scatting
" shoo
- be
- doo
, da
- be
- dah
"
. i can see why she wanted to have a rock song forthe tjhe film
, she
' s a good singer
. not that she was the only funny charachter in the film
,
though
. wayne knight
( who played stan in space jam
) gives a whimsically funny style to tantor
, an elephant who isnt especially worried about stepping into
" un
- sanitary
" water
.
( thankfully
, there isnt no real sound of flatuence
- thyat would have killed tjhe picture
)
. the songs
, as i said before
, are decent
, mostly sung by collins
. this sets a new st
andard for disney animated films because for the first time
, the characters do nto sing
. i tolerate musical numbers fomr characters a lot mroe thna smoe otehr guys would
,
but i foudn this tothe be a nice chanage ofthe pace
. tjhe story does hvae elements ofthe comedy in it
,
but they also load it with strong dramatic touches
, which mkaes this film far better than hte unbelieveably uninspired hercules
. if there is anything disappointing about tarzan
, it might be the ommision ofthe tje
' n sync version ofthe
" trashing the camp
" from hte film
. i heard it on the sountrack
,
and wondered where it was going tothe be
. i wass upset that it wasn
' t
, because i had
thought of taking a fewd friends of mine who like
' n sync tothe see tarzan
. oh
, well
.
.
. overall
, i was enthralled withthe tarzan
. i wouldn
' t hold it high the way i do with mulan or the hunchback of notre dame
( my all
- time favorite disney classics
)
,
but this film deserves a high palce among disney
' s greatest acheivments
. i give a nod to disney for follwoing up their spectauclar
*
*
*
*
* masterpiece
, mulan
, with this great animated adaption ofthe egar rice burrough
' s tarzan
.
