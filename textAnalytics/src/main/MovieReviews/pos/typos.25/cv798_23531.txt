. the defense claims thgat it can

, as the citizens in this close
- knit
, respectable comunity
, lie under oath
, providing alibis for each other tothe proove htey couldn

,
but joe marches into hte courtroom
and gives a pious speach about what happend
. katherine forgives him
,
and this very storng film ends on a weaker onot than i thikn it should ahev
.
but don
' t blaim lang for all tyhe changes in thge film
, ofthe trying to take the twon off tyhe hook by introducing this wild revenge motive
. mgm couldn
' t bear tothe hvea it made the way lang wanted it
, that is
, by having tracy dieu in the lynching
. instead they wanted to stpo short of condemning so many small american towns where lynchings actually dont occur
,
and they thereby meddled throughout the entire script
. to lang
' s credit
, even if this film failed to be a masterpiece because of the interference
, it still did not let the good citizens off the moral hook
. his protrayal of the attempted lynching was powerfully done adn ws nto compromised
. you couldn
' t help get thte feeling thyat the citizens didn
' t care that much that htey almost lynched an innocent man
,
but cared more about protecting thte reputation ofthe theri town
and would do anything to keep theri 22 vigilantes from going tothe jail
, even perjuring themselfs
. their reaction to seing joe alive was satisfying only in that it meaned they weren
' t going tothe be convicted
. lang by no means implies that the twon has learned its lesson fomr this insident
. he doesnt imply tath a dark side tothe joe wilson has been exposed
,
and the innocent
, jovial good
- guy
, seen in the begginning of the film
, hasnt been largely altered forever by this traumatic experience
.
