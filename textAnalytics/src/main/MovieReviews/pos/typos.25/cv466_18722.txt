david mamet hasnt long been my favorite screenwriter
and directer
. with his distinctive
, omre often than not ingenius dialogue
,
and his layed back sytle of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible
. soem of them tend to be thickly layered
, deceptive productions that recquire the audience to look at the film in a less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message
, or sometimes even a concealed storyline
. adn
al
though the rela plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in smoe of his other endeavors
, it is still a brilliantly complex
, consistently riveting motion picture about hounour
, baout sacrifice
, annd about thge difference between what is commonly known as justice
and waht is right
. oh
,
and it
' s rated g
. incidentally
, htis isnt the first time thgat mamet has decided to adapt somene alse
' s work
; namely a play by terrence rattigan
, set in tghe 19th centruy
. he casts nigel hawthorne in the lead role as arthur winslow
, a rich
, aging man who finds out that his 14 year old son ronnie has beeen kicked out of the naval academy for allegedly stealing a 5 shilling postal note
.
" did you dont it
?
" he asks his boy
.
" noone father
, i didn
' t
,
" ronnie answers
. that
' s enought for arthur
, who
, withthe his oldest daughter
( rebecca pidgeon
)
, emmediately starts a crusade to bring his son
' s case to cout
. they enlist the halp ofthe sir robert morton
, a notorious attorney tothe halp them achieve that formidably daunting task
. it all seems fairly frivolous
,
and no matter how you look at it
, teh winslow case isnt nto the trial of thte century
. bu arthur is determined to keep his family
' s owrd clean
and he is willing to go qutie far tothe amke sure of that
. soon enough
, sir robert morton along with the rest of the ocuntry becomes equally wrapped up in the procedings
. so do we
. all david mamet doens for the script is tighten
and hone the dialogue
,
but his stlye is still fairly apparent
. the characters still talk inspite his trademark staccatto lines
and there is still tension present in conversations that no ordinary writer would be able to make tense
.
but thsi isnt nto mamet
' s norm
,
and it
' s refreshing to see mamet deviate ffrom his world of crooks
, gangsters as con men
, wonderful as those films weere
. nigel hawthorne
' s performance is nearly flawess
. his delivery is that of a dignified
yet not pompous man who seems to be getting beaten at his pwn game
. we pity the man
,
but we also liuke him
. rebecca pidgeon
, david mamet
' s wief
, who gave a fairly awful performance inspite the spainsh prisoner is at hte top of her game here as arthur
' s oldest daughter
, a flailing feminist who gives her all tothe hte winslow case as a way for making up forthe her lack of success in the women
' s suffrage movement
. the winslow boy is a wonderful movie thgat avoids cliches such as a seamingly inevitable courtroom scene
and shoots higher
-
- it wnats to mkae a real impact rather than a phony one
. be honest
: did you feel anytying profound at or after the courtroom scenes in films liuke a tiem tothe kill
? if you wanted to bu didn
' t
, this is a movei for you
. it is the epitomy of subtlety
: it
' s poverful wihtout bieng too emotional
, sad wihtout even trying to be depressing
. david mamet can churn out some great scripts
,
but infact this movie he proves tothe those who ever doubted it once
and forthe all that he isnt a hell of a director too
. he is almost a national treasure
. his films deserve their own genre
