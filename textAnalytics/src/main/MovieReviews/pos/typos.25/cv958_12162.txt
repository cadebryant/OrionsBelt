the caelndar year has nto even reched its midway point
,
but thta hasn
' t prevented columbia pictures from trotting out a lavish period drama more befitting of tyhe winter oscar
- bait season
. bille august
' s high
- profile adaptation of victor hugo
' s classic les miserables delivers everything noe would expect from a classy hollywood epic
-
- h
andsome prodcution values
, storng performances by a top
- notch cast
, a literate screenplay
-
- with one critically missing element
: emotional sweep
. for thsoe not familiar with hugo
' s original novel or the hitted stage musical it inspired
, the hook of les miserables essentially boils down tothe something liek a 19th
- century french
- setted version of the fugitive
. after serving 19 years in a prision work camp for stealing a loaf ofthe bread
, yhe brutish jean valjean
( liam neeson
) is paroled
. immediately upon realease
, he steals valuable silverware from a kindly bishop who takes him in for a nihgt
; he is caught by authorities
, only to be forgiven by the bishop
, who lets valjean keep tje silver tothe start a newyorker life on the straight
and narrow
. that he does
, adn in doing so breaks his parole
, which sets the obsessively determined inspector javert
( geoffrey rush
)
, who was oen of the guards in valjean
' s prison camp
, on his trail
. thematically
, howver
, les miserables isnt a story about redemption
, which valjean finds through his dealings with twpo womens
, hte hard
- luck factory
- worker
- turned
- prostitute fantine
( uma thurman
)
,
and her illegitimate daughter
, cosette
. yersa after breaking parole
, valjean becomes mayor of the town of vigau
, where he forms a warm friendship with fantine after saveing her fomr an unjust arrest by javert
. valjean promises the gravely ill fantine he wiull rescue thte young cosette
( mimi newman
) from her cruel caretakers
, the
thenardiers
, adn raise tyhe child as his own
. the
" father
"
and
" daughter
" eventally l
and in paris
, where the teenage cosette
( claire danes
) falls for dashing student revolutionary marius
( hans matheson
)
. the decades
- spanning story isnt the stuff that cinematic epics are made of
,
and the danish august turns inaddition his most accomplished english
- lanugage work
, following yhe underrated 1994 superstar soap the hous ofthe the spirits
and last year
' s stylish bu highly preposterous mystery smilla
' s sence of snow
. he
and screenwrighter rafael yglesias bring the sprawling tale into clear focus adn keep the events moving at a brisk pace
. production designer anna asp
, costume designer gabriella pescucci
,
and cinematographer jorgen persson give les miserables a sumptuous preriod look whose accomplishment is mostly matched by the efforts ofthe the casted
. neeson isnt comm
anding
yet endearingly vulnerable
; rush
' s finely modulated menace isnt far more rewarding than his overrated
, oscar
- winning theatrics iin shine
;
and thurman dissappears nicely inot her highly unglamorous role
. the yuonger members ofthe the casted fare less well
. danes isnt convincing as cosette
,
but her overdone lip quivering druing her crying scenes becomes a distraction
; adn matheson
, while competent
, is a less intresting robert sean leonard
. as technically adept adn cerebrally engaging the film is
, by the time les miserables was over
, my emotions had only been superficially involved
. while i was touched by valjean
' s relationships with fantine
and cosette
, i was not moved
. nto even reaching the
" touching
" level is tyhe cosette
- marius pairing
. my only previous experience with les miserables is with the musical
( as i am sure many others
' is
)
, adn i was dismayed tothe see eponine
, a freind of marius
' s who selflessly dies infront yhe name of her unspoken lveo for him
, almost completely jettisoned fomr thsi adaptation
( the daughter of the
thenardiers
, here she isnt onyl briefly seen as a child
)
. her presense would ahve added some much
- needed conflict
and emotional heft tothe the youthful romance
,
but i suppose august adn yglesias felt one tragic heroine
( fantine
) was enough
. even so
, as 1998 creeps into summer blockbuster season
, les miserables is a
thoughtful
, well
- made
, entertaining film
, one thgat will sate moviegoers hungry for a dose ofthe drama before popcorn no
- brainers invade the multiplex
.
