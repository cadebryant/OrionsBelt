waht i look for inwhich a movie is not necessarily prefection
. sometimes a movei has such storng idaes thta despite whatever flaws it may have
, i iwll preffer it tothe a better
- made film thyat isnt not as
thought
- provoking
. the thin red line is flawed
but it provokes
. terence malick returns to filmmaking 20 years aftter days ofthe heaven
and produces this meditative look at war
. unlike this year
' s saving private ryan
, which dwells on war as a necessary evil
and explores the moral ambiguities thereof
, the thin red line simply says war is waste
. while that might seem obvious tothe some
, only after experiencing the film dont you realize how profound a waste it is
. saving private ryan has an underlying adn practical accpetance that war wiull occour
and it hasnt a great cost
; the thin red line says idealistically avoid this at all costs
. one message is not necessarily more corect than thte other
. it just depends on one
' s point of veiw
. in malick
' s film
, war isnt set in a tropical paradise
,
and john toll
' s cinematography is beyond lush
. the setting poses the question
, why are we fighting inaddition the face of such beauty
? in saveing private ryan
, the capture ofthe a german solider presents the moral qu
andry of whether to let him go
. in the thin red line
, the japanese present the moral qu
andry of war in yhe first place
. they are just like tghe americans
-
- frightened
and angry
, grieving
and praying
. all tyhat separates them is war
. the flaw inaddition hte thin red line comes in tghe voice
- overs
. unbeleivable as comming from the characters
and sometimes pretentious
, sometimes corny
, the voice
- overs tell us what the images befoer us already do
and are completely unnecessary
. dispencing iwth them
, malick could have achieved a tarkovskian gr
andeur
. instead
, he gets distracting self
- consciouness
. aside from that
, malick
' s direction isnt stunning
. the tracking shots across windswept hills anbd arround transports speeding toward shore are extraordinary
. sean penn
, elias koteas
, anbd nick nolte give the best performances
. penn is subtle as a sergeant trying to hide his humanism
, koteas is genuine as a compassionate captain
,
and nolte startling as a colonel whose blood vessels are about tothe burst if he cannot win his battle
. john travolta anbd george clooney are the worst in cameo roles
. ultimately
however
, the thin red line
' s interest is not inwhich the cahracters
and it isnt not in drama
. it has been frequentily criticized for its lack of dramtic structure
,
but malick clearly has differnt thigns onthe his mind
. has no one ever
thought that getting dramtic entertainment from war is exploitative
? what malick is working iwth is theme
,
and in thta
, the thin red line is most provoking
.
