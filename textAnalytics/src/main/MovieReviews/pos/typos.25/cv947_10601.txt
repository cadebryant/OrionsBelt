the premise isnt simple
, if not bizarre
. a mad scientist
( trace beaulieu as dr
. clayton forrester
) launches an average
- joe
( michael j
. nelson as mike nelson
) inot space where he forces his subject tothe watch the most horrendous movies ever made
. why
? it
' s torturous
, it
' s maniacal
,
and it
' s just plain fun
. based on the cult
- favorite cable television serieses
, mystery science theater 3000
: the movei isn
' t torturous
,
but as fo being maniacal
and just plain fun
, it foots the bill quite nicely
. mike nelson
, on a dog
- bone shaped spacecraft
, spends his days as any young man would dream
- indulging in sarcasm
and horseplay
, annd seing quite a few movies
. the catch is
, these movies aren
' t hte movies he chooses
, bu retched examples of film
- makeing chosen specifically by dr
. forrester in an attempt tothe break mike
' s will to live
. dr
. forrester is conviced that noe too many b
- movies is all it will take tothe ruin a man
,
but with a couple of wise
- cracking puppet buddies
( tom servo
, voiced by kevin murphy
,
and crow t
. robot
, voiced by beaulieu
)
, the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party forthe all that is wrong in tghe world of cheezy cinema
. the purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some of thte worst films known
( even if by very fewd of us
) tothe man
. we watch as thge silhouettes of mike
, toom
, annd crowm sit in a darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them
. in htis case
, it
' s the 1954 sci
- fi film this isl
and earth
. we basicaly watch as our three leads watch
, only we get the blessure ofthe eavesdropping on their hilarious commentary
. the plots behind the movies ripped appart are really quite irrelevant
,
but for the sake of thsoe who might want to nkwo
, i
' ll explain this one
. this isl
and earth is the tale of twpo scientists
, a man
and a woman
, who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth
. together the twpo fight to survive as well as sive their home planet
. to make mst3k work
, the film
- within
- the
- film natuarlly hasnt to be as horrible as possible
,
and
al
though tyhe tv
- series introdued us to several worse films tahn this isl
and earth
, it
' s a bad anough flick tothe bring about some hysterical cruelty
. mst3k
, which doesn
' t actually contain yhe complete tihs isl
and earth
, is a short 73 minutes
,
but this is a step very wisely taken
. as funny as some of their observations are
, it can only go so long
. ocasional breaks ffrom this isl
and earth also help the film tremendously
.
al
though it takes a second to get back into the right mode aftter this premise has been left for a moent
, it
' s better than overkilling the hwole concept post haste
. mst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly
,
but if ytou don
' t konw what yuo
' re in for
, it could be a jarring dissapointment
.
al
though i
thought the sharp wit of this film was worth threee stars
, it is a movie to be seen onthe home video
, lite at nght when your brain is not functioning tothe full capacity anyway
, anbd with a large
, saracastic crowd
- new year
' s at midnight fo example
, which isnt wehn i saw it
. warning
:
al
though mst3k has more to its end credits thna most
( the three leads use the credits to poke soem mroe fun
)
, they are actually more annoying than most
. the name sl
andering
and asinine one
- liners were extremely unfunny
,
and after laughing for baout 70 mintues straight
, it put a heavy damper on the overall experience
. most people will likely stay to see waht the smart
- alec
' s hvae to say
,
but for me
, it almost ruined an otherwise good film
.
