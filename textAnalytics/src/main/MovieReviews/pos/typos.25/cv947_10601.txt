the premise isnt simple
, if not bizarre
. a mad scientist
( trace beaulieu as dr
. clayton forrester
) launches an average
- joe
( michael j
. nelson as mike nelson
) into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made
. why
? it ' s torturous
, it ' s maniacal
,
and it ' s just plain funn
. based onthe the cult
- favorite cable televsion serieses
, mystery science theater 3000
: the movie isn ' t torturous
,
but as for being maniacal
and just plain fun
, it foots hte bill quite nicely
. mike nelson
, on a dog
- bone shaped spacecraft
, spends his days as any young man owudl dream
- indulging in sarcasm
and horseplay
,
anbd seeing quite a few movies
. the catch is
, these movies aren ' t the movies he chooses
,
but retched examples of film
- making choosen specifically by dr
. forrester in an attempt to break mike ' s will to live
. dr
. forrester is convinced thyat noe too many b
- movies isnt all it will take to ruin a man
,
but whith a cuple of wise
- cracking puppet buddies
( tom servo
, voiced by kevin murphy
,
anbd crow t
. robot
, voiced by beaulieu
)
, the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party for all that is wrong infact the world ofthe cheezy cinema
. the purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some ofthe tjhe worst films known
( even if by very few of us
) to man
. we watch as teh silhouettes of mike
, tom
,
and crow sit in a darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them
. in this case
, it ' s the 1954 sci
- fi film this island earth
. we basically watch as our threee leads watch
, onyl we git the pleasure ofthe eavesdropping on thier hilarious commentary
. the plots behind thge movies ripped apart are raelly qutie irrelevant
,
but for the sake of those who might want to know
, i ' ll explain tihs noe
. this island earth is the tale of two scientists
, a man
and a woman
, who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth
. toghether the twpo fight to survive as well as save their home planet
. tothe make mst3k work
, tyhe film
- withing
- the
- film naturally has tothe be as horrible as possible
,
and
although the tv
- series inctroduced us tothe severeal worse films tahn tihs island earth
, it ' s a bad enough flick to bring baout some hysterical cruelty
. mst3k
, whihc doesn ' t accually contain the complete this island earth
, isnt a short 73 mintues
,
bu this isnt a step very wisely taked
. as funny as soem ofthe their observations are
, it can only go so long
. ocassional breaks fomr this island earth allso help tjhe film tremendously
.
although it takes a second to get back inot tjhe right mode after this premise has been left for a moment
, it ' s better tahn overkilling the whole concept post haste
. mst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly
,
but if you don ' t knwo what ytou ' re inwhich for
, it could be a jarring disappointment
.
although i throught hte sharp wit of htis film was worth three stars
, it is a movie to be seen on hmeo video
, lite at night when your brain is not functioning to full capacity anyway
,
anbd with a large
, saracastic crowd
- new year ' s at midnight for example
, whihc is when i saw it
. warning
:
although mst3k has more to its end credits than most
( tje three leads ule the credits tothe poke some more funn
)
, they are actually more annoying than most
. the name slandering
and asinine oney
- liners weere extremely unfunny
,
and after laughing for about 70 minutes straight
, it put a heavy damper on the overall experience
. most peopel wiull likely stay tothe see what tyhe smart
- alec ' s ahev to say
,
but forthe me
, it almost ruined an otherwise good film
.
