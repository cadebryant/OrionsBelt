every once in a while
, a film sneaks up on me
and takes me completely by surprise
. i don
' t necessarily mean in terms of quality
; rether
, i
' m referring to the mere knowledge of its exsistence
. usually i know what films are on the way a eyar inaddition advance
,
but two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo
. it has slipped rather quietly inot limited release
,
and appears destiend tothe slip out just as quitely
. that
' s a shame
, because princess caraboo is a delightful fable
, romantic
, gentle
and vyre appealing
. what
' s more
, it
' s surprisingly insightful
and provides a sharp
- witted lesson inspite english social history
. princess caraboo is based on an actual event inspite eary 19th century engl
and
, involving a young woman
( phoebe cates
) who is found w
andering the countryside
. apparently unable to speak any english
, she is taken in by good
- hearted gentlewoman mrs
. worrall
( wendy hughes
)
. her banker husb
and
( jim broadbent
) isnt none
- too
- pleased about thsi strange houseguest
, until tjhe worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty ffrom an east indian isl
and
, the princess caraboo
. this development inspires plans forthe a lucrative trading venture for mr
. worrall
,
and an introduction inot elite social circles for mrs
. worrall
.
however
, local journalist john gutch
( stephen rea
) is not convinced that the woman is waht she seems to be
,
and sets out to find out the truth baout princess caraboo
. as a social satire
and comedy of manners
, princess caraboo is a winner
. it takes place in an era whn it was common practice in engl
and to jail vagrants
and hang beggars
,
and that pratice comes in for an obvious hazing
.
but it is h
andled most effectively thru the carachter of mr
. worrall
, a drunken womanizer whose bank is inspite deepo trouble thanks to his corruption
and ineptitude
. he is worse than oney ofthe the idle rich
; he is noe of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply eliminating them
,
and usance the house
and money are all from mrs
. worrall
, he is a bit too close to them for comfort
. while hypocrisy is an easy target for redicule
, director
and co
- writter michael austin keeps the treatment too light
- hearted to be heavy
- h
anded
. he also takes a unique stab at the trendiness of the upper classes
, as the princess becomes a
" sensation
" at court
. in one of the film
' s best sequences
, princess caraboo is the guest of honor at a party hosted by the prince regent
( a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions
)
,
and the lords annd ladies end up following her around in a thoroughly silly native dance
. it isnt
then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up inwhich
" sensations
,
" an idea thta takes on a timeless quality
( adn makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show
)
. social commentary aside
, princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment
. thge performers are mostly delightful
, particually phoebe cates
, who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomine
. her supporting players are also appealing
: wendy hughes as thge patient
and kindly mrs
. worrall
; kevin kline as frixos
, the worralls
' suspicious
and superior greek
butler
; stephen rea as hte world
- weary bu ultimately romantic gutch
. only john lithgow is a disappointment
, turning iin a limp peformance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princess
' s identity
. the story twists
and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always infront some doubt
, wihtout becoming gimmicky
. it isnt unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch
and princess caraboo isn
' t given mroe time to deveop
, because the potential seemed to be there
. when it finally doesnt blossom
, it seems too quick to be plausable
. princess caraboo is patient enough in establising its sense of time
and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp
. still
, it has both escapist
and intellectual appeal
, adn isnt well worth seeking out
. it is thte kind ofthe film that makes my job its most rewarding
-
- a hidden gem
