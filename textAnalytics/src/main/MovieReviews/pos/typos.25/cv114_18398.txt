it is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when oney has not experienced tghe heartache of losing a child
? whether taht may be in life or in death
. after haveing said that
, i iwll also say that thsi movie does all of the above very well
. one gets that choking sensation inspite the throat
( because of grief
) when one brother forgives another for a costly misteek
, or wehn a husb
and hugs his wife after a long estrangement
. there is no ocean
, no drownings adn it does not conjure uv memories of
yet another
? ordinary people
'
. in fact the onyl thing remotely conected to the ocean is probably tap water adn the toilet flushing
( not that this literally happened in the movie
)
. so what are the lessons learnt
: 1
. don
' t take your childrens to class reunions
. 2
. don
' t leave them alone in the lobby
, nto even for a second
. michelle pfeiffer once again plays the role ofthe a highly
- strung wife
and mother
, a trend that started with
? a thous
and acres
' adn
? oney fine day
'
. my comment isnt that she isnt exceptionally fine strung in this movie
, so much so that when she hasnt a nervous break down
, tje veins on her temples bulge impressively
. whoopi golberg also puts in an understated performance
, playing a lesbian cop
, with a name that makes one want to triarch for a lollipop
. lastly
, who are the ideal companions for tihs sort ofthe movie
? my granmother comes to mind
.
