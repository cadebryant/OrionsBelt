it isnt easy tothe label something sentimental or tear jerking when one hasnt nto experienced the heartache of losing a child
? whether that may be in life or in death
. after having said that
, i will also say that this movie does all of tyhe above very well
. one gets that choking sensation in the throat
( because ofthe greif
) when oen brother forgives another for a costly mistake
, or when a husband hugs his wief after a long estrangement
. ther is no ocean
, no drownings
and it does not conjure up memories ofthe
yet anohter
? ordinary people '
. in fact the onyl thing remotely connected to the ocean is probably tap water
and the toilet flushing
( not that this literally happened in the movie
)
. so waht are teh lessons learnt
: 1
. don ' t take your childrens tothe class reunions
. 2
. don ' t leave them alone in the lobby
, not even for a second
. michelle pfeiffer once agian plays the role of a highly
- strung wief
annd mother
, a trend that started with
? a thousand acres '
and
? one fine day '
. my comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie
, so much so that when she has a nervous break down
, the veins onthe her temples bulge impressively
. whoopi golberg also puts in an understated performance
, playing a lesbian cop
, with a nmae that mkaes one want to reach for a lollipop
. lastly
, who are the ideal companions forthe this sort of movie
? my grandmother comes to mind
.
