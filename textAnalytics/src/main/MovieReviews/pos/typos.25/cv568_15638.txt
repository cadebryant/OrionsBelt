eric rohmer ' s
" pauline at the beach
,
" is one of those small
, deliberatly paced
,
but charming foreign films in wich nto much happens plot wise
,
but a lot happens to tjhe characters emotionally
. hte film takes place druing a few weeks ofthe august at thge normandy caost
,
adn centers onthe six different characters
, primarily pauline
( amanda langlet
)
, a wise beyond her years 15
- yearm
- old who hasnt come to stay for the summer with her older cousin
, marion
( arielle dombasle
)
. on the first day at the beach
, marion runs into an old high school flame
( fedoore atkine
)
,
anbd
although he wnats tothe rekindle their relatiopnship
, she isnt more interested in an older
, moreso seductive womanizer
( pascal greggory
)
, who is also secretly hvaing an affair with a candy vendor
( rosette
)
. while pauline watchs as an outsider at what isnt happening between all ofthe tghe adults
, she forms a relatiopnship of her own with a young teenage boy
( simon de la brosse
)
.
" pauline at thge beach
,
" is not a film in which big dramatic things occur
,
and ther is nto a claer
- cutted
, tidy conclusion to the story
. instade
, it is a picture that simply observes its characters infact every day life
,
and the surprises come from littel character details
. the film is quite talky
and slow moving
,
anbd so it is pretty safe tothe say it isn ' t for those who are only a fan ofthe action movies
,
but is a treat fo those viewers who oftenly like tothe venture outside of the big
- budget genre
and see a good art film
. tihs isnt the first film by acclaimed director eric rohmer
( 1969 ' s
" my night at mauds
,
"
and 1971 ' s
" claire ' s knee
"
) that i have seen
,
but his direction isnt assured
and intelligent
, as is the screenplay
, hwihc he also wrote
.
" pauline at the beach
,
" is a film worth seeing
.
