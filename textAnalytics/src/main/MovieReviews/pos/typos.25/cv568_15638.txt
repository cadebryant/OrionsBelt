" isnt one of those small

" pauline at the beach
,
" isnt nto a film in which big dramatic thigsn occur
,
and there is nto a clear
- cut
, tidy conclusion to the stoy
. instead
, it is a picture that simply observes its characters in every day life
,
and thte surprises come from little character details
. the film is quite talky
and slow moving
,
and so it is pretty safe to sday it isn
' t for those who are only a fan of acation movies
,
but is a treat forthe those viewers who often like to venture outside of the big
- budget genre anbd see a good art film
. this is the frist film by acclaimed director eric rohmer
( 1969
' s
" my night at mauds
,
"
and 1971

.
" pauline at the beach
,
" is a film worth seeing
.
