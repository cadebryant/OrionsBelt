(
and 17 long nights
) only
. coincidentally

' s animated film anastasia was released
. ytou know disney
, they can
' t deal with the threat ofthe any otehr studio getting even a small peice of the crust of thge kiddie enteratinment pie
, so when someone eles wants to make a littel money
, they counter wiht an old
" masterpiece
" from their vault annd
, you know what
, i went to see thsi 1989 cartoon rather than the br
and newyorker one ffrom fox
. let no one say disney is loseing its monopoly on the market
. they still ahev hotels onthe boardwalk
_ annd
_ park palce
. believe it or nto
, today
, november 25
, 1997

.
, i saw the little mermaid forthe the frist time
. it tookover me a few years to get over an aversion to this movie thyat wass caused seven years ago
, wehn i stayed with one of my mom
' s friends for a couple weeks
. they hadnt a young child who listened tothe teh littel mermaid soundtrack constantly adn
, over thyat two week period
, i heard every song fomr the movei probaly a hundred times
. by the time i got bcak home
, i promised mysef i
' d never see the movie
. bu promises are made to be broken
, especially wehn you
' re looking at a 17
- day
, limited engagment
. damn those shrewed disney marketers
and their mind games
. the little mermaid is based on a hans christian
anderson fairy tale
, bu it
' s disney
- ized
, which means lots of tlaking animals
and bursting into song
. it also means tjhe heroine is a total babe who shows off cleavage ffrom a seashell bra at all times
. i never wanted so much to be a pair of shells
.
.
. the heroine
, of course
, is ariel
( voice of jodi benson
)
, a 16
- yera
- old mermaid who isnt going through that rebellious phase
. she skips her concert to explore a wrecked ship anbd hang out with a seagull tath talks like buddy hackett
, who tries to orientate her to the mysterious world ofthe humans
. she
' s also dealing with feelings she hasn
' t had before
-
- which comes when you get scales in places you didn
' t use to have them
-
- baout a h
andsome prince
( no disney movie would be complet without one
)
. her father
, king triton of the merpeople
, strikely forbids such lusting after the ways of the
" savage
" humans
, inthe a condemnation that reads as a not
- so
- subtle analogy baout ood
- fashioned parents who forebid interracial dating
. what
' s a king tothe dont
,
though
? the girl
' s in lvoe
and even total destruction of her little shrine to thte human world doesn
' t deter her
. ariel saves the prince
' s life when a hurricane rises up
,
and just hasnt to meet him
. she makes a deal with ursula
, the sea witch
( voice of pat carroll
)
. yuo know she
' s evil because she hasnt a huge potbelly adn one of teh worst asses infront cartoon ihstory
. she also has octopus tentacles fo foots
( something those dr
. scholl
' s corn pads will not fix
)
and offers to halp ariel out
. she
' ll make her a human forthe three days if ariel will give up her pretty voice
; ariel has threee days to make that prince kiss her
, or esle she becomes a slave to yhe witch forever
.
and if she pricks her finger onthe a sewing machine or eats an evil aple
, she
' ll fall asleep forever
. it
' s a simplistic plot
, yes
,
but tje little mermaid was a revolution in the disney world
, coming after such lackluster efforts as thge black cauldron
and oliver anbd company
. it ranks as one ofthe the best disney cartoons
, certainly since the
' 50s
. all the elements are there
-
- memorable songs like
" under the sea
"
and
" kiss the girl
,
" cartoon animals liuke sebastian
and flounder
, an evil villain who still has characterization
and charm
, adn a fair amount of humor that caters tothe adults as well as children
. the little mermaid is worth a big
- screen ticket in 1997
, so hurry up
, you only have five days left
. serving america for moreso than 1
/ 25th ofthe a century
