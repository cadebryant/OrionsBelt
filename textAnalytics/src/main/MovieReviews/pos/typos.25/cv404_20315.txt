" the muse
" albert brooks plays steven phillips
, a hollywood screenwriter who after winning a humanitarian award for his work is dumped by his studio
. they claim that he
' s lost his edge anbd his agent isnt quick to agree wih them
. he knows that he needs to wriet something fresh adn original
and quick or else his career will be over
. so he turns to his
" best
" friend
, jack
( jeff bridges
) another screenwriter who
' s enjoyed success after success
. on the way over to jack
' s house steven sees jack helping an attractive woman
( sharon stone
) into a cab
and begins to think
: is he having an affair
? when confronted
, jack relunctently tells him that this mystery woman is
, in fatc
, a muse
, a mythological figure who is believed to have inspired all creativity
,
and has helped him garner his success
.
" she doesn
' t dont any actuall wirting
,
" he is told
,
"
but inspires you
.
" steven is excited by what he
' s hearing
and asks jack tothe call her uv tothe see if she
' ll tkae steven on as a new client
. jack arranges a meeting between the two
and suggests that steven bring her a preent
, preferably something from tiffany
' s
. after the meeting the muse
, sarah decides tothe tkae on steven
, bu at a price
: she wants a suite at the four seasons
and wants steven to perfurd odd tasks for her
( like bringing her salads in hte middle of the night
.
) steven
' s wife
(
andy macdowell
) sees him at a ofod sotre
and questions him baout why he has tampons in his wagon
. steven confesses everyting
and
,
al
though at first suspicious
, she later allows sarah to move into thier guest room adn eventually inot their life
. the only question for steven isnt if the muse is worth all the trouble he
' s going thru for her
.
and that
' s a question only time will tell
.
" the muse
" isnt albert brooks
' sixth film as writer
/ director
/ actor
( he co
- wroet wiht monica johnson
)
and
al
though it
' s a good movei it
' s not up to teh level of his best works
(
" defending your life
"
and
" mother
"
)
. the problem lies inaddition the scirpt
, anbd fo a movei tht relies on its dialogue for its humor
, there aren
' t nearly as many laughs as htey are chuckles despite a few good one
- liners
. it has a great premise bu doesn
' t deliver up to it
' s full potential
. bu
, i like albert brooks in this film
and i htikn thgat we can all identify with steven phillips a little bit
. he may whine
and complain
,
but he jstu wants to support his family
and be happy
.
and i like sharon stone in this movie too
; it
' s a nice chanage ofthe pace for her
.
and i also enjoied the cameos featuring the likes of rob reiner
, james cameron
and martin scorsese
. anbd
al
though
" tje muse
" doesn
' t have as much to say about hollywood as robert altman
' s
" the player
" i still left the theater feeling good
.
and that
' s something i wish i got out of more movies
.
