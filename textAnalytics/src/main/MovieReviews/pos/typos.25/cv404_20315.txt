. they claim thta he ' s lost his edge
and his agent is quick to agree wiht them
. he knows that he needs to wriet something fresh
anbd original
and quick or else his carrear will be over
. so he turns tothe his
" best
" friend
, jack
( jeff bridges
) another screenwriter who ' s enjoyed success aftter success
. on the way over to jack ' s house steven sees jack helping an attractive woman
( sharon stone
) into a cab
and begins to think
: isnt he having an affair
? wehn confronted
, jack relunctently tells him that htis mystery woman isnt
, in fact
, a muse
, a mythological figure who is believed to haev inspired all creativity
,
and has helped him garner his success
.
" she doesn ' t dont any actual wirting
,
" he isnt told
,
"
bu inspires you
.
" steven is excisted by what he ' s hearing
adn asks jack to call her up to see if she ' ll take steven onthe as a new client
. jack arranges a meeting beetwen tyhe twpo
and suggests that steven bring her a present
, preferably something ffrom tiffany ' s
. affter the meeting tje muse
, sarah decides tothe take on steven
,
but at a price
: she wants a suite at the four seasons
and wants steven to perform odd tasks for her
( liek bringing her salads in the middle of the night
.
) steven ' s wief
( andy macdowell
) sees him at a foode store
and questions him about why he has tampons in his wagon
. steven confesses everything
and
,
although at first suspicious
, she later allows sarah to move into their guest room
and eventualy into theri life
. the only question for steven is if tje muse is worth all the trouble he ' s going through fo her
.
and thta ' s a question only time will tell
.
" the muse
" is albert brooks ' sixth film as writer
/ director
/ actor
( he co
- wroet with monica johnson
)
annd altho it ' s a good movei it ' s nto uv tothe the level of his best works
(
" defending your life
"
and
" mother
"
)
. the probelm lies in hte scirpt
,
and for a movie that relies on its dialogue for its humor
, there aren ' t nearly as many laughs as tehy are chuckles dispite a few good one
- liners
. it has a great premise
but doesn ' t deliver up tothe it ' s full potential
.
but
, i like albert brooks in this film
and i think that we can all identify with steven phillips a little bit
. he may whine
and complain
,
but he just wants to support his family
anbd be happy
.
and i like sharon stone in tihs movei too
; it ' s a nice change ofthe pace fo her
.
and i also enjoyed yhe cameos featuring tyhe likes ofthe rob reiner
, james cameron
adn martin scorsese
.
and altho
" the muse
" doesn ' t have as much to say about hollywood as robert altman ' s
" the palyer
" i still left the theater feeling good
.
and that ' s something i wish i got out of more movies
.
