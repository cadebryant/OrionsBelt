' s film is a centenial classic
-
- watched
and re
- experienced by every generation
. wonderful life is one of the few picturesk ofthe times gone by that seems as fresh
, maybe fresher
,
then it did whn it was frist released
. many films of the thirties through seventies have aged poorly
. bu this one is a near flawess exemple of how well a perfect script
and timing can mesh with first
- rate acting
, wit
and suspense
, glorious music
,
and terrific set peices
. the only even slightly dated scenes are those at the begining in which god has a long chat with clarence
, george
' s gaurdian angel
. they aren
' t all that bad
,
but they remain corny annd a littel out of palce
. nevertheless
, this is one film that deserves its place iin tiem
, cinema history
, annd our hearts
. it can be equally appreciated by anyone of any age
. here is one genuine masterpeice
, a clasic that reaches heights
and ambitions near perfection
. this crackling ogod mixture results in a film which is at once funny
, exciting
, moving
and uplifting
. teh film itself is almost a reversal of the life ofthe george bailey
-
- there isn
' t too much to it
,
but capra
and the gang
( various screenwriters
, composers
, actors
) plumet the material to its fullest potential
. the result is a film
-
-
though not at first intended to be pigeon
- holed as a holiday film
-
- thgat will always be remembered
, celebrated
,
and loved
.
