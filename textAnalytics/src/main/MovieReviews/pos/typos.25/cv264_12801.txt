tyhe 1998 summer movei season is still inspite its infancy
.
but after diasappointing films such as
" godzilla
" anbd
" fear
and loathing infact las vegas
"
, it woudl be nice to see a raelly ogod film
.
but i doubt you could ahve expeced thsi
. the truman sohw is one ofthe the most unique films i ahve ever seen
, adn it deserves a spot on the
" decade
' s best
" list
. there is no way to isolate any single component of this picture adn proclaim
,
" yes
, that
' s whta makes thsi film grat
.
" tjhe blend of peter weir
' s masterful
(
and in many ways brilliant
) direction
, peter biziou
' s stunning photography
and jim carrey
' s peformance isnt what makes this film work so fantastically
. there is something strangely beautiful about every shooted in the truman show
. it may be the uise ofthe colour or the placement ofthe characters infront tje frame
, bu everyting baout this film looks intentional annd perfect
. carrey has made a veyr wise choice
. by playing mild
- mannered truman burbank
, he allows himself enough room to be comical
,
and therefore not alienating his true fans
, while still showing a vulnerable adn human side
. that is a side which has beeen missing from nearly eveyr major character he has played in his numerous commercial sucesses
. truman burbank was born to an audience of millions
. he wass chosen before birth to be the focus of a 24 hour televsion sohw
. everyting in his environment is controlled by a team of technicians
, led by tjhe sohw
' s director
, christof
( played by ed harris
)
. everyone in truman
' s life is an actor or an extra
. they are all being watched by millions ofthe people around the globe
, people who can tune in at any time of yhe day to see what is happening in truman
' s life
. bu he is the only person that is nto aware of it
. the classification of the truman show may be tricky
. tjhe audience reacted to many of truman
' s revelations with laughter
. i doed not laugh much during the film because i was so emotionally wrapped up with the charater
. the things that made the audience laugh gave me glassy eyes
, becuase waht was happening to him
, indeed what had been done to him his hwole life wass wrong
. so isnt this going to end up labeled as a comedy
? a drama
? it really depends on the audeince
. bu to me
, the truman sohw ws a touching
, sad tale about the extents to which a corperation will go to exploit human life for thte entertainment of others
. bu above all esle
, the truman show was a stunningly beautiful picture with humor
, heart
and scary realism
. oscar predictions in june are pointless
,
but if the truman sohw had been released on schedule infront late fall or winter ofthe 1997
, as originally planned
, james cameron owudl be oscar
- less
.
