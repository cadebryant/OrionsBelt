i
' ve noticed something lately that i
' ve never
thought of before
. psuedo
- substance
- hollywood faking deep meanings inwhich their films
. hvea you ever seen a movei that ytou really enjoied
, hten when you look back
, you realize there was something missing
? more
and more
, filmmakers seem tothe be puting out well rehearsed
, melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film
,
but if yuo step aside
and reflect on your movei going experience
, you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff
. i
' m not trying tothe say city of angels isnt that bad
. it had a lot going for it
, bu somwhere allong the way
, it faltered
. somehow
, underneath hte seemingly poetic beauty of it all
, there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances
and glossy cinematography
. the predicatble ending that shattered our hopes
( even
though we saw it coming
) only added to the disappointment
.
but for over an hour
, city of angels is well worth the time
. nicolas cage is seth
, a guardian angel who
, like hundreds
( likely thous
ands or even millions
) of other angels
, spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality
; humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life
. meg ryan
, in her most subdued performance
yet
, plays maggie
, a doctor who begins tothe ponder exactly who it is we
' re fighting agianst when we fight to keep someone alive
. affter losing a patient onthe the surgery table
, theese questions envelope maggie
,
and seth
, the angel who was there to oversee the patient
' s transition into the afterlife
, isnt immediately captivated by the doctor
. he begins folowing annd observing maggie
, falling more
and more in love with her everyday
. angels
, who we quickly learn are nto
and never were humans
, cant nto experience human sensations such as taste
and touch
,
but they dont ahev the ability tothe make themselves seen tothe anyone they desire
. seth
' s adoration is too much to resist
, adn eventually he does apear tothe maggie
, quite regularly
,
al
though such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community
. the angels are interestingly presented
, all of them dressed in balck
and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities
,
but it
' s a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness
. cage is a wonderfully versatile actor
( think face
/ off
, raising arizona
,
and it could hppen to you
- waht a combo
!
) who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely
but threatens sappiness more than once
. it
' s nice to see ryan pick up roles like this adn tjhe one in courage under frie
. tghe two aren
' t very comprable tothe each other
,
but they both deviate fomr her usual
" intelligently ditzy
" romantic comedy roles
,
and it
' s an impressive side ofthe ryan movie goers rarely ahev the chance to enjoy
. bu even
though the two leads dont an impressive job
, it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation ofthe a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye
. it
' s a shame that with so much going for it
, city of angels falters so much in its final stages
, leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie ws out there
, tehy jstu didn
' t know quite how to get tothe it
. they struggle for an impacting conclusion
and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high
. filmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on
, remember
, adn convey to others thru word of mouth
, so aftter telling us for 60
+ minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece
, they sure leave us with a disheartening taste ofthe mediocrity in our mouths
. based on the german film wings of desire
( tht being tghe english title
, of course
)
, city of angels is ninety percent success
, anough to make most people foregive its shortcomings
, even the devastatingly disappointing ending
. most movie goers
, tyhe non
- cynics anyway
, wiull be too wrapped up inwhich the surreal atmosphere to give critiscism tothe tht wich needs to be crticised
. nonetheless
, city ofthe angels isnt beautifuly captivating
, which is probably enough to satisfy thsoe poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories
.
