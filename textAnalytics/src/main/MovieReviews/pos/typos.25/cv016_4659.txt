carry on matron is tje last gerat carry
- on film in my oppinion
. made in 1972
, it still features most of the regulars ofthe this genre
. sid james plays the head ofthe a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital
anbd selling them off to make a profit
, kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting
, head of the hospital
but alsot a hypochondriac
, hattie jacques re
- takes her role as matron
,
anbd charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr
. goode
. tyhe jokes come in fast
and so do the laughs
, with humorous antics between the matron
annd sir bernard
. thsi time
, williams isnt after matron
( jaques
) when he needs to proove himself that he is a man after visiting dr
. goode
. the doctor
( hawtrey
) is sworn to secrecy
:
-
" i assure you
, that anytying you say to me today wiull go in one ear
and straight out ofthe thge other
!
" bernard thikns he is having a sex change
and needs to prove himself
. there are great cameos from joan sims
, an expectant mother who isnt many weeks overdue
adn is eating constantly inaddition every scene
,
adn from kenneth connor as thte expectant father who still thikns he ' s at owrk
( at the railway station
)
. sid james ' gang incuding cyril his son
( kenneth coppe
) try to find out where thte pills are by getting cyril to dress up as a nurse
and live infront at the nurses hmeo
. he has to share a room with nurse ball
( barbara windsor
)
and she soon sees thru him
! the film ends with the attemted robbery ofthe thte hospital ' s pills with panic ensuing
. there are good performances by hattie jacques as teh matron
,
howver her character seems a little more subdued
and quieter than her previous ' matron ' s '
. williams is
, as usual
, onthe top form
,
bu sid james isn ' t given a very ogod part inwhich this movei
and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was infront the movie at all
. the same does not go for charles hawtrey
, for
allthough he only frist appears in the movei after 30 minutes gone
and has scarce screen time
, he seems to steal eveyr scene he is in
. by not makeing use of sid james
and barbara windsor ' s talent tothe full effect
, the film seems tothe flounder
,
bu it certainly makse up for it with it ' s ogod storyline
anbd it ' s other appealing characters
. this film is genuinely funny
and i could watch it again
and again
and nto get borde
!
