carry on matron is the last graet carry
- on film infact my opinion
. made iin 1972
, it still features most of the regulars of this genre
. sid james plays the head of a gang ofthe crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital
and selling them off to make a profit
, kenneth williams isnt sir bernard cutting
, head of the hospital
but also a hpyochondriac
, hattie jacques re
- takes her role as matron
,
and charles hawtrey is thge psychiatrist dr
. goode
. tjhe jokes come in fast adn so do the laughs
, with humorous antics beetwen tyhe matron
and sir bernard
. this time
, williams is after matron
( jacques
) whn he needs to proove himself that he isnt a man after visiting dr
. goode
. hte doctor
( hawtrey
) is sworn tothe secrecy
:
-
" i assure you
, thast anytying you say to me today will go iin one ear
and straight outloud ofthe tjhe otehr
!
" bernard thikns he is having a sex change
and needs to prove himself
. htere are grat cameos from joan sims
, an expectant mother who isnt many weeks overdue
and is eating constantly in every scene
,
and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he
' s at work
( at the railway station
)
. sid james
' gang incuding cyril his son
( kenneth cope
) try tothe fidn out where the pills are by getting cyril tothe dress up as a nurse
and live inspite at the nurses home
. he has to share a room with nurse ball
( barbara windsor
)
and she soon sees through him
! the film ends iwth the attempted robbery of the hospital
' s pills iwth panic ensuing
. there are ogod performances by hattie jaques as the matron
, howver her charater seems a little more subdued
and quieter than her previous
' matron
' s
'
. williams is
, as usual
, on top form
,
but sid james isn
' t given a vyre good part inspite htis movie
and i owudl forgive anyone to forget that he was infront the movie at all
. thte smae does not go for charles hawtrey
, fo
al
though he only firt appears inwhich the movie aftter 30 minutes gone
and has scarce screen time
, he seems to steal every scene he is infront
. by not making use of sid james
and barbara windsor
' s talent to full effect
, the film seems to flounder
,
but it certainly makes up for it with it
' s ogod storyline
and it
' s otehr appealing charactors
. this film is genuinely funny
and i could watch it again
and again annd not git bored
!
