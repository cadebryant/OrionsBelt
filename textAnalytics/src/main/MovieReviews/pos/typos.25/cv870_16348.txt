.
" tlaking baout love is like dancing baout architecture
"
)
, bu changed becuase it sounded too much like the receet box
- office dud dancing at lughnasa
, this film slaps together a stunning casted of hollywood names
, playing interesting
and well
- writed characters
, withing a vignettes
- styled plot arrangment a la robert altman

. critique
: charmingly effective romantic drama
, this film offers insight inot various types ofthe relationships
, presents us with interesting characters
and excellent performances from the casted
,
and scratches beneath tghe surface ofthe love
and its many complex subtleties
. how do people fall in love
? why do peopel fall out of love
? how do people fall back into love
, once they
' ve been hurt
and left tothe join the lonely hearts club
? all of these questions adn more
, are touched upon inaddition tihs film
, withing several types ofthe variant relationships

. a husb
and letting go of his inhibitions
. an older couple dealing with a past
" love
" of the man
, a secret recently uncovered
. a son dieing from aids
, joined by his mother at the hospital
. there are many nuances tothe this picture
, anbd many ideas
and quotes to whic we could all relate
,
but more importantly
, there isnt diversity
. diversity of relationships helpped me annd my gang of friends enjoy this film on many levels
. some related to the yuonger couples
' issues
. others with yhe marryed
. there
' s a little bited of everything for everyone in here
.
and i woudl bet dollars to donuts that if i were to watch this film agina in a year
, i would relate myself to yot another predicament
. just like love itself
, this movie is distinct
and appreciated by all on many differant levels
. the actors in this film are all also very
, very ogod
. sean connery is solid as thte older man with some issues to resolve
, as is gena rowl
ands
, as the agin wief with trepidations
. jolie comes out of this film a star with a great performance
, hwile philippe isnt as preety
- boy as ever
.
anderson leaves scully far behind with her wonderful portrayal of a damaged woman trying to re
- ignite her lveo life
, opposite a surprisingly admirable performance by former talk
- sohw host
, jon stewart
. even dennis quaid manages tothe step outside ofthe his overacting shoes in this film
,
and offers a convincing sohw of a man lost withing his own imagination
. tghe only peice of this puzzle which left me somewhat detatched
, wass tjhe part surrounding jay mohr
, the man dying from aids
, anbd his mother
, ellen burstyn
. the actors were fine
, bu somehow
, the piece seemed out ofthe place within the realm ofthe everthing else
. the ending of this film was also a little too saccharine for me
, bu i guess that
' s jsut hollywood
. this film is actually a lot liek your friends
and neigbors

) in concept adn style
,
but its complete anthesis in regards to charachter relatibility
and likeness
. the characters in those films were too unique
and inhuman for anyone to care
, as opposed to this film
, which offers rich
and believable cahracters
, living real lives
and talking about rela issues in todya
' s relationships
. all in all
, this movie offers many interesting characters
, talking annd living genuine
and engaging love lives
, wonderful performances by its solid cast
, too sweet of an ending
,
but an enjoyable adn rewatchable movie nonetheless
