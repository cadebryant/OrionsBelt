i rented thsi movie witht vyer high hopes
. htis movei got praise as one of the best films of 1998
,
and unfortunately
, was not as good as i hoped
,
but was still veyr intriguing
and throught provoking
. first of all
, the casting for this film is great
. tobey maguire
and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood
. they play their roles as the parker brother
and sister perfectly
. with a plot as unbelievable as this film
, ytou need chemestry
and honest acting ffrom your cast
. tobey
and reese
( bud
and mary sue parker
) play their roles perfectly anbd display thier characters with honesty
and believability
. william h
. macy
, an acto i have grown to loev over the past year
, turns in anyother great peformance as the tv dad who is torn over his wife
, a
" colored
" person
and his firends
, the
" non
- colored
" ones
. he allso displays believability annd must display a certian lack of chemistry with his wife
. he does htis perfectly adn
yet again shows why he should be oney ofthe tjhe top actors in hollywood
. joan allen is equally great as betty parker
, the ideal tv mom
. her character is the most ambitious
. she is very na
? ve
,
and must display this well to make her character believable annd she doens just that
. her lack of chemistry with macy
, hwihc the role calls for
,
and her developed chemistry with jeff daniels is terrific
,
and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest ofthe the cast
,
then this film would even been even better
. as said before
, jeff daniels gives a bad performance
. his character displays the chanage gogin on throughout the twon
,
yet he does nto display it with enough conviction
. his character is veyr confusing anbd he is not very believable
. this film could hvae been elevated to a whole new level had daniels beeen able to give a better performance
. the movie isnt very provacative
. it challenges the issues ofthe racism that exsited infact thte past annd that still exist today
. i realyl was not expecting all of the elements they brought up
,
but htey pulled them off with such flair that it was mind blowing
. they demonstrate the racism issue without a hitch
,
but dont it in a slow pace
. the only major flaw in thte film besides teh performence by daniels is length
. some films are not meant tothe be that long
. pleasantville is one of those films
. tihs film could have beeen so much better had htey not moved so slowly to it
. first
, they are amazed by hte implementation of colour
. thne tehy want to have it
.
then tehy dont not want to
.
then the war ensues between the colored anbd non
- colored
. this is all strung out over two hours
, which was way too long
. some movies ened a lot of time
. saving private ryan was a little bit under three hours long adn i throught it coudl ahve used more time
. this film is only two hours long
,
and seems much longer
. length is everthing in films
. if you can nail down the perfect timing
and pace
, yuo can win half the battle
. pleasantville cxan move at a ogod pace at times
,
but it is not consistent enough
. overall
, pleasantville is a vrey pleasant adn provacative departure from the predictability of most films these dyas
. i went in expecting a light
- hearted film about change
. i left learning an important lesson about racism
and the way things change
. luckily
, pleasantville teachs tihs lesson inaddition such a way to make it appeal tothe all audiences
. only if it could have done in a shorter amount ofthe time
.
