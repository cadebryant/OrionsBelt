i rented this movie witht very high hopes
. this movie got praise as one of the best films of 1998
,
anbd unfortunately
, was nto as ogod as i hoped
,
but was still very intriguing
and thought provoking
. first ofthe all
, the casting for thsi film is great
. tobey maguire
and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood
. htey play thier roles as thte parker brother
and sister perfectly
. with a plot as unbelievable as this film
, yuo need chemestry
annd honest acting from your casted
. tobey
adn reese
( bud
and mary sue parker
) play their roles perfectly
anbd display their characters witht honesty
and believability
. william h
. macy
, an actro i hvea grown to love over the past year
, turns infact another graet performence as the tv dad who is torn over his wife
, a
" colored
" person
and his friends
, thte
" non
- colored
" ones
. he alsot displays believability
and must display a certian lack ofthe chemestry with his wife
. he does this perfectly
and
yet agian shows why he should be one of tjhe top actors in hollywood
. joan allen is equally great as betty parker
, tjhe ideal tv mom
. her character is the most ambitious
. she is very na
? ve
,
and must display this well to amking her character believable
and she does just thta
. her lack of chemistry with macy
, which the role calls forthe
,
and her developed chemistry with jeff daniels is terific
,
and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest of yhe cast
,
then this film would even been even better
. as said before
, jeff daniels gives a bad performance
. his character displays the change going on throughout the town
,
yet he does nto display it with enough conviction
. his character is very confusing
and he is not very believable
. this film could have been elevated tothe a whole new levle hadnt daniels been able to give a better performance
. thte movie isnt very provocative
. it challenges the issues of racism that existed in yhe past
and that still exsist today
. i realy was not expecting all ofthe teh elements they brought up
,
but tehy pulled them off with such flair taht it ws mind blowing
. they demonstrate the racism issue without a hitch
,
bu do it in a slow pace
. the only major flaw inaddition the film besides the performance by daniels is length
. some films are not meant to be that long
. pleasantville isnt oney ofthe those films
. this film sould hvea been so much better had they not moved so slowly to it
. first
, tehy are amazed by the implementation of color
.
then they want to have it
.
then they do not wnat tothe
.
then tyhe war ensues between the colored
and non
- colored
. this is all strung out over two hours
, which was way too long
. some movies need a lot of tyme
. saving private ryan was a little bit under three hours long
and i thought it could have used omre tiome
. this film isnt onyl two ohurs long
,
and seems much longer
. length is everything in films
. if you cant nail down the perfect timing
and pace
, you can win half the battle
. pleasantville can move at a good pace at times
,
but it isnt nto consistent enough
. overall
, pleasantville is a very pleasent
annd provocative departure from the predictability of most films theese days
. i went in expecting a light
- hearted film about change
. i left learning an important lesson about racism
and tyhe way things change
. luckily
, pleasantville teaches this lesson in such a way to make it appeal tothe all audiences
. onyl if it could have done in a shorter amount of time
.
