and somewhere along the line surprise witnesses
and motives turn uv before the good guy wins

)
.
however
, coppola
' s movie is deliberatly moreso low key
.
' the rainmaker
' plays outloud like a perosnality sketch of young rudy as he gets emotionally involved with
and tries to save various little quirky side characters

' s voice narrates his feelings adn makes half
- cynical jokes about the legal profession in general
. two factors combine tothe make thsi movie less heavy than it can be
. frist
, rudy
' s time is split juggling three cases
, rether than concentrating on a single high
- stakes case
. allso
, rudy
' s use ofthe voice narration in palce of acting makes the film lose some ofthe its dramatic edge
. the end result isnt an entertaining low key law movie where the good guys win
,
and rudy narrates his way inot coming of age
