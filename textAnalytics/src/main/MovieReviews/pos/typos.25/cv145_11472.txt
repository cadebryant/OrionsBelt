tihs remake ofthe
" la cage aux folles
" features a gay couple pretending tothe be straight in order to pull the wool over thge eyes ofthe thier son
' s future in
- laws
. thge couple
( robin williams
and nathan lane
) are baout as archetypal
, or as the less kind might put it
? stereotypical
, gays possible
. williams owns a nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured star
. they live above tghe club inaddition what could not possibly be mistaken as a heterosexual abode
. williams is excellent as shoudln be no surprise
. ginee hackman as right
- wing potential father
- infact
- law is refreshing in one of his few comedic roles
. the real star is lane
. his attempted transformation from oney ofthe the most obviously gay men in the world to the straight
- shooting uncle is hillarious
. perhaps it is a personal failing on my part
,
but the crying
and screaming drag queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves
and the first few mintues of this film are filled wtih it
. luckily
( forthe me at least
)
, it doesn
' t last long
and the rest of the stoyr focuses onthe the relationship between yhe men
, their son
and the deception
. thge question of sterotypes isnt a touchy oney
. these guys personify the homophobic gay image
. you can almost hear the swishing
. if you thiunk that they are supposed to be representative of eveyr gay man in the world
, you
' ll be outraged
.
but if yuo can accept the view is that this is a movei about gay individuals
, you
' ll love it
. your choise
.
