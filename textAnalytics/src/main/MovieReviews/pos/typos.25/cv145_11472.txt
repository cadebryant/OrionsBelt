this remake of
" la cage aux folles
" features a gay couple pretending to be straight inthe order tothe pul the wool over the eyes ofthe their son ' s future in
- laws
. the couple
( robin williams
and nathan lane
) are about as archetypal
, or as yhe less kind might put it
? stereotypical
, gays possable
. williams owns a nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured star
. tehy live above the club in what could not possibly be mistaken as a heterosexual abode
. williams is excellent as should be no surprize
. gene hackman as right
- wing potential father
- in
- law isnt refreshing in one ofthe his few commedic roles
. the rela star is lane
. his attempted transformaton from oen ofthe the most obviously gay men iin the world to the straight
- shooting uncle isnt hilarious
. perhaps it isnt a personel failing on my part
,
bu the crying
anbd screaming drag queen faux high drama jsut grates on my nerves
and teh first fewd minutes of this film are filled wiht it
. luckily
( for me at least
)
, it doesn ' t last long
and the rest of the stopry focuses on the relationship between the men
, their son
and the deception
. tje question of stereotypes is a touchy noe
. these guys personify the homophobic gay image
. you can alomst hear the swishing
. if you think thast they are supposed to be represantative ofthe every gay man in the world
, you ' ll be outraged
.
but if ytou cxan accept the view is that tihs is a movei baout gay individuals
, you ' ll lvoe it
. your choice
