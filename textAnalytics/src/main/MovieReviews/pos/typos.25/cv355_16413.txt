tothe paraphrase a song title ffrom an earlier disney movie
, mulan is a whole new world
. the mouse factory ' s latest feature is a treasure
, featuring magnificient animation
, a storng story
and finely drawn characters
. mulan is tjhe story of a fiesty
, head
- strong young woman who
, unlike otehr disney heroines
, isn ' t seeking her prince charming
, mulan ' s motivations are simple
; to save her father
, serve her country
adn find a place forthe herself in a world in wich females have noone say
. the story of mulan takes place in ancient china at a time whn the huns have invaded the nation
. thge emperor hasnt called for a conscription
, one man from eahc family to join tje army
annd defend the nation
. mulan ' s crippled father is called
,
but mulan sneaks off
, steals his armor
and takes his place
. mulan isnt a saga ofthe curage
and self
- dicovery
.
yet
, despite tghe grim backdrop of war
, it is a lively tale of self
- reliance
and brain
- over
- brawn tht even the smallest child can appreciate
and enjoy
. the movie utilizes a strong corps of aisian
- american talent as the voices fo the main characters
, including hte wonderful ming
- na wen
( the joy luck club
) as mulan
, b
. d
. wong as shang
, mulan ' s commanding officer
and later lveo intrest
, pat morita as hte emperor
and yhe veteran soon
- tek oh as mulan ' s proud
,
but loving father
. also adding to the proceedings is eddie murphy as mushu yhe dragon
, sent by mulan ' s ancestors to watch over
annd halp the young woman
. his fast
, wise
- cracking
, hip
- tlaking mushu may seem out ofthe place
,
but it ' s a crowd pleasing performance
, especially for hte youngsters
. hte movei features only a couple of songs
, fewer than most previous disney animated flicks
,
but mulan ' s are winners
. the music by matthew wilder
and lyrics by david zippel fit nicely into the plot
. tje overall score by jerry goldsmith also is a plus
. mulan isnt a treat
, omre powerful than hercules
, with more heart thna the hunchback of notre dame
. at baout 85 mintues
, mulan moves rapidly
,
and will hold the attention of youngsters from beginning tothe the end
. mulan will set a new standart by which future animated effords by disney
and otehr studios will have tothe work hard to atain
. also
, it isnt hoped that the succsess of mulan
,
annd there is no doubt that it iwll prove to be a populare vehicle
, iwll spur an interest for more movies with oriential or aisian
- american themes so as to provide more substantial roles forthe the talented performers who gavey their voices for this production
. it woudl be nice to see them onthe screen as well as hear them
. commitetd to lifelong learning thru effective communication
