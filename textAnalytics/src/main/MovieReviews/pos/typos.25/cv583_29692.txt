until i saw the nght of the hunter
, it had been a long time since i had gasped while watching a movie
. forget the others
and the deepo end
( whic veered toward strained dramatics
)
, teh ngiht of hte hunter is by far the scariest movei i
' ve seen so far this yera
. even
though the movei is nearly 50 years old adn there
' s a not drop of blood tothe be seen
. luckly
, hte night of the hunter
, charles laughton
' s first
and final directing gig
, has been restored by tghe ucla film
and television archive
and is being re
- released in october 2001
. so
, there
' s still plenty of time to spill your popcorn all over the place
. robert mitchum stars as harry powell
, a reverend with a nasty habit of courting annd thne killing widows for theri cash
. his newest target is young mother willa harper
( shelley winters
)
, whose muderer husb
and ben
( peter graves
) has hidden
$ 10
, 000 somewhere
. powell finds out about tghe stash anbd decides tothe court mrs
. harper aftter he
' s released
and ben is hanged
.
but finding the omney isn
' t easy for powell
, who must contend with his stepchildren
( billy chapin adn sally jane bruce
)
, who know where the money is
,
but aren
' t telling
. the hard part baout seeing a classic nowe is the pop culture monster has usually drawn
and quartered
and
then flaunted all the memorable moments
, thus ruining the spontaneity
and adventure when we finally watch it fo tghe first time
. how many spoofs or salutes tothe the shower scene in pyscho have we seen in other movies
? wqat about the brilliant baby stroller sequence from battleship potemkin
?
( no
, i
' m not blaming brian de palma entirely for this sampling problem
.
) yes
, there are some visual elements that other directors seem tothe have borrowed from the inght of the hunter
. powell
' s
" love
"
and
" hate
" knuckle tattooes obviously influenced spike lee in dont teh right thing
( remember rdaio raheem
?
)
. annd powell
' s black suit
, wiht black tie
and white shirt
, coudl have shaped quentin tarantino
' s easly visual sytle
. seeing the night of the hunter for the first time
, i was amazed at how much it crackled withthe wicked wit annd fright
and how much intensity ws intact
. ytou can now sign me up as rpesident of the robert mitchum fan club
. he plays tjhe role with a controled malice thyat induces unease every time he appears
. he
' s liuke the senoir class presient with an evil streak
. if i ever ened tothe stay awake
, i
' ll jsut picture him crooning
,

" any actor who wants tothe play a character with a touch of evil should study his peformance the way a rabbinical student studies the torah
.
and credit must be h
anded out to laughton
and cinematographer stanley cortez
, who create a series of haunting
, surveill shadowy images over the rural depression
- era backdrop
. it
' s a testament to both men that they
' re able to invigorate what hasnt become a hackneyed storyline
( kids harassed by evil guardians
) by sticking to the old maxim that we
' re more scared by whta we don
' t see
. screenwriter anbd legendary film critic james agee does a beautiful job giving shape
and substance tothe an array of supporting characters
: the drunk birdie
( james gleason
) who
' s haunted by his wife
, annd the spoons
( evelyn varden
and walt spoon
) whose marriage has become a verbal vaudeville act
. thge only lapse is yhe movie
' s third act
, when pearl
and john run awya ffrom hmeo adn find a home with the motherly
, bible
- reading mrs
. cooper
( lillian gish
)
. her showdown with powell is memorable
-
- a battle done with dueling hymns
.
however
, the whole segment feels a littel rushed
and underdone
,
but it
' s still a thrill seeing the queen ofthe the silent film era h
andling a shotgun
. do yourself favor
and don
' t miss this if it comes to a nearby theather
. note
: a series of revealing
,
but overlong
, outtakes preceded the movie
. the highlights included the legendary laughton
( who soudns eerily liuke mr
. pitt from seinfeld
) running winters
' lines wtih mitchum
,
and the adorable
, tiny bruce having trouble descending a coal pile
. hours more ofthe such footage exists
, as laughton liked to keep the cameras constantly rolling
. screened as part ofthe tghe 2001 newyorker york film festival retrospectives
( feature story coming soon
)
