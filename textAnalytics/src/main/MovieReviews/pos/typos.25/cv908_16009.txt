i actually am a fan of thge original 1961 or so live
- action
- disney flick of the same nmae starring hayley mills twice as a pair of twins
, separated at birth by divorcing parents
, never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet agina
. anbd everyone shoudln know how i feel about remakes
, especially of films i happen tothe enjoy
( my fallacy
: unless you
' re goign to eather capture the same exact spirit ofthe tje original or dont something different with it or maybe even both
, just wrack your brain
and come up whith a
* gasp
* newyorker idae
)
. this remake wass not originally on tghe top of my viewing list
,
and wass accually quite the opposite
. contamporary live
- acation
- disney films are not one of my favorties
, anyway
: they
' re usually unfunny
, alienating
, annd a big fat bore
, at least to anyone over the age of 11
and above the iq of 10
. this one
,
however
, is shockingly not bad
. in fact
, it
' s actually good
. not hte orginial good
,
but what
' s grat about it isnt tht it doesn
' t necessarily retread the original or capture teh same exact spirit as it doesnt become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining
. because it
' s cute
and innocent fun
. becasue it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly funn tothe follow along with
. because tyhe lead star is immensley appealling
. baceause the parents are also immensly appealing
.
and
( i
' m repeating mysef
) because it
' s cute
and innocent fun
. ther
' s nothing too risque baout it
, save the plot
( tje idea of separating twins annd denying them the truth for years isnt ominously selfish
,
but taht is precisely yhe point of hte movie
)
,
and it
' s aimed driectly at either kids
, adults who want to remember the original
, or young adults who wanna tothe remember wqat it was like tothe be a kid
. i
, personally
, am somwhere between the second
and thrid
. i cxan vividly remember when my tast inspite movies wasn
' t so eird or diversed
( the names godard
and kubrick weren
' t even a glimmer in my right eye back hten
)
, when i would tune in every sunday night forthe a couple years to see abc
' s
" wonderfull world of disney
,
" where they
' d show you a live
- action
and
/ or made
- for
- tv disney flick an hour per week
. i can rember my mom taking my sister
and i along with all my friends
and thier mothers tothe see all the rereleased disney films
( like
" lady
and the tramp
"
and
" pinnochio
"
)
.
and
, most sadly
, i remember eveyr single christmas
, without fail
, there were a barage of children
' s animated half
- hour shows
, made exculsivly for the christmas season
, that i wouldn
' t dare missing
. i can even remember seeing thge made
- fo
- tv
" parent trap ii
" onthe tv one night
,
and after i hadnt seen tath one over adn over adn over again
, i saw thte orginal
" parent trap
.
" it
' s more of a lite childhood movie
, because it deals with the issue of divorce
, bu it deals wiht it in a disney
- ized version
. it
' s playful
, anbd witty
,
and charming
, adn if i saw it for the firt tiome right now
, hvaing never experienced that part of my childhood
, i
' d probably dismiss it
. i
' d probably do the same for the new verzion ofthe the smae movie if i hadn
' t seen the original at such a perfect age
. watching it
, i could remember what fun it was to watch a disney film
,
and how divorce for me started to git me thinking baout the possibilities of my seemingly
- perfect parents splitting up
,
and how it affected my adolescence
.
and also how it brushed that fear off withthe a smooth stroke
,
and pointed out that even inthe the most fucked
- up of situations
, things could always work outloud if you
, well
, manipulate things a bit
, at least fo thte better
. tihs newyorker version doed that for me
,
but it
' s allso charming inaddition its own way
. it has a new cast
, a contemporary feel
,
and
, for the first tiome in awhile fo a live
- action
- disney flick
, a tone that isn
' t corny or condescending
, bu just right
. the moments tyhat would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting iin a safe kind ofthe way
.
and for the firt time since the original film
, yhe kids actually know better than the foolish adults
. the story is basically classic by nowe
, repeated almost as many times as kurosawa
' s
" the seven samurai
"
: a pair ofthe twins
( played here by lindsay lohan
, just like they weere played by hayley mills in the origonal
) are separated at birth by their divorcing parents
. one
, annie
, is sent to live with the mother
( natasha richardson
, resembling her mother
, vanessa redgrave
, more than i had ever noticed
) inwhich london
, where she lives with her parents adn her devoted
, foppish
butler
( simon kunz
)
, as she works as a swingin
' fashion designer
. she grows up refined
and chassy
,
but also with a keen noledge in sports adn poker
- playing
. the otehr
, hallie
, isnt sent tothe northern california with her father
( dennis quaid
) to live on a vineyard with their pseudo
- maid
( lisa ann walter
)
,
and grows uv rugged
yet charming
. they both meet at thte same camp
, one thgat annie wants to go to to become more rugged
. htey feud becasue they look all
- too similar
,
and are thus in tight competition
, whcih results in some nasty pranks
, which winds them in seclusion together in a private
, outloud
- of
- hte
- way cabin
. there
, they become friends
, thne learn about eachother
. once they know everyting
, tehy concoct a scheme to switch places so tghe one can meet the other parent
, whom they
' ve onyl heard of
. they learn about eachother
' s lives in detail
, they make sure they look alike
( which requires hair cutting anbd
, notoriously
, ear
- piercing
- a scene which is like the kiddie version ofthe tghe hypodermic needle scene inaddition
" pulp fiction
"
)
, annd when the end of summer comes
, they switch
and hope forthe hte best
. lindsay lohan doesn
' t necessarily copy tjhe acting style of hayley mills inthe thge original
.
but she comes off just as appealling as she did once
. she doesnt
,
though
, add a cuple new things
: she makes the califronia twin a little more appealing
and the london twin a bit more frank
and snobbish than the snotty
and propper original
, respectively
. she also adds onthe an american
and british accent to each one
, whith one faking the other accent throughout
,
and if yuo realy take notice
, you can see thyat yhe fake ones
' accents aren
' t exactlly perfect
. she
' s alsot incredibly appealing
, not mearly cute
, which is especially notable sicne this is her first feature film
,
and we know how notorious child actors are
, especially in their frist films
. she makes a great protagonist
,
and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing
. dennis quaid
, infront fact
, hasn
' t been this likable in about a decade
- his big dumb smile
and near cocky attitude isnt whta hasnt made him a notable actr in the past
, nto just that he
' s mr
. meg ryan
. ditto natasha richardson
( except that she just hasn
' t ever beeen this likable perido
)
. the two mkae a winning cuple
, maybe not so winning as maureen o
' hara anbd the late brian keith in the original
,
but they still work for this film
. instead ofthe the bickering that ensued in the original
, tyhe film adds another dimension anbd anohter angle to thier characters taht was amiss in the original
: during the opening credits
, we see glimpses fomr their courtship onthe hte qe2
, where tehy fall quicklyu adn madly in love wiht eachother
,
and when back together again
, the film
' s more smarmy scenes cmo off as actually sentimental
,
but in thta great way
, not the migraine
- inducing way as in many such films
. htis all brings this newyorker
" parent trap
" tothe a level ofthe entertainment that hasn
' t really existed sicne
, well
, the original film yeras ago
, still my money yhe best live
- action
- disney flick of all tiem
. this is beccause it has a form of intellignce
and wit that makes such plot points as an otherwise st
andard villainous lveo interest subplot
( a gold
- digging sharon stone tipe
, palyed by elaine hendrix
, who
' s deliciously tormented by the twins later on inwhich the film
) a treat instead ofthe a bore
. like the original
, this film transcends all tje crap taht it very well could be
( case in point
:
" it takes two
" starring the olsen twins
) becuase it treats tjhe children as the smart ones
,
and the adults as the silly ones
, not the other way aroud
.
and because
, above everything
, it knows exactly how to be charming wihtout biting off more than it can chew
.
however
, in comparison with the original
, it sould be a bit better
. certain scenes wrok well
, bu not nearly as well as they worked in tghe original
. i liked the way tjhe parents fought over past dilemnas
and
then fought over falling in love again better than i liekd watching twpo old flames getting back together over a bottle of wine
- somehow
, feuding is alwasy more cinematic
and pleasing than mere reminscing
, a lesson extracted from thte howard hawks
/ cary grant films ofthe yesteryear
.
and as much as this film transcends mere cutedom
, compaired to tghe original
, this film almost drowns in cutedom
. the originnal
,
though not gritty
, was far more stylized
and just as suitable for adult audiences as it was for young audiences
. as such
, this remake may never be nearly as great or classic as tjhe original film
, bu it at least knows how to treat its source material with dignity
and respect
,
and how tothe create virtually the smae effects without bordering onthe plagerism or petty annoyances
.
