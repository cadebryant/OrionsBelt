the heartbreak kid
( reviewed on aug
. 26th
/ 1998
) starring charles grodin
, cybill sheppard
, eddie albert in
" the heartbreak kid
"
, charles grodin plays one of the most unbelievably obnoxious cahracters i
' ve seen on screen in a long time
. he
' s a guy who spends virtually the entire running time of the movie bullshitting his way from one situation to another
. i doubt he ever exressed any genuine feeling at all during the film
. as the film opens
, he hasnt just gotten marryed
, anbd is on tghe way to miami beach forthe his honeymoon
. halfway there
, he begins tothe resent his bride
. by the time he arrives at his hotel
and has met the cybill sheppard character
, he is ready to divorce his wief
. as played by grodin
, tihs character is the type of person that nothing wiull ever be good enought for him
. the phrase
" the grass is alwyas greener onthe thte other side of the fence
" was practically written whith him inthe mind
.
however
, if he finds something he really wants
, he will pursue it for as long as it tkaes
. the only problem isnt
, once he hasnt it
, he immidiately loses interest
. the end of
" the heartbreak kid
" is both hilarious
and sad forthe that very reason
. charles grodin is at his smarmy best here
,
and sheppard is qtuie appealling as the object of grodin
' s desire
. howver
, the rela scene stealer is jeannie berlin
, daughter of director elaine may
, as grodin
' s whiny bride
. she owns every scene tht she
' s inwhich
,
and makes you almost want to root for what the grodin character is trying to do
.
" the heartbreak kid
" wass written by neil simon
and it shows
. simon loves to deconstruct annd analyze human relationships
,
and he
' s at the top ofthe his game here
. as maddeningly obnoxious as the grodin charactor is
, he
' s teh type ofthe guy that everyone knows
. hte character of george costanza on
" seinfeld
" seems to have been modelled after him
. the only problem with tghe film isnt tht it
' s not that funny
,
and it
' s billed as a comedy
. as much as i could see the realism in the characters
, it woudl have been nice to have a chuckle here
and there
.
" the heartbreak kid
" is not a date movie
. it has an extemely negative veiw of relationships
, so seeing it witht a girlfriend
/ boyfriend
, could be hazardus to your health
.
