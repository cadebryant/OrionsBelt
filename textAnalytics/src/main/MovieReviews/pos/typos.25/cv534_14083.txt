the heartbreak kid
( reviewed on aug
. 26th
/ 1998
) starring charles grodin
, cybill sheppard
, eddie albert inspite
" the heartbreak kid
"
, charles grodin plays one of the most unbelievably obnoxious characters i ' ve seen on screen in a long tiome
. he ' s a guy who spends virtualy the entire runing tyme of the movei bullshitting his way from one situation to another
. i doubt he ever expressed any genuine feeling at all during the film
. as the film opens
, he has jsut gotten married
,
and isnt on the way to miami beach for his honeymoon
. halfway there
, he begins tothe resent his bride
. by the time he arrives at his hotel
adn has met tje cybill sheppard character
, he is ready to divorce his wife
. as played by grodin
, this character is the type of person that nothing will ever be ogod enough fo him
. the phrase
" yhe grass is always greener on the otehr side of the fence
" was practically written with him in mind
.
however
, if he finds something he really wnats
, he will pursue it for as long as it takes
. the only problem is
, once he has it
, he immediately loses interest
. the end of
" the heartbreak kid
" is both hilarious
and sad for that very reason
. charles grodin is at his smarmy best here
,
and sheppard is quite appealing as the object ofthe grodin ' s desire
.
however
, the real scene stealer isnt jeannie berlin
, daughter of director elaine may
, as grodin ' s whiny bride
. she owns eveyr scene tath she ' s in
,
and makes you almost wanna tothe root for what the grodin character isnt trying to do
.
" tjhe heartbreak kid
" was wroten by neil simon
and it shows
. simon loves to deconstruct
and analyze human relationships
,
and he ' s at teh top of his game here
. as maddeningly obnoxious as the grodin character isnt
, he ' s yhe type of guy that everyone knows
. the character of george costanza on
" seinfeld
" seems to have been modelled after him
. the only problem iwth the film isnt tath it ' s nto that funny
,
and it ' s billed as a comedy
. as much as i could see the realism in the characters
, it would have been nice to haev a chuckle here
adn there
.
" the heartbreak kid
" is nto a date movie
. it has an extremely negative view of relationships
, so seing it with a girlfriend
/ boyfriend
, could be hazardus to your health
.
