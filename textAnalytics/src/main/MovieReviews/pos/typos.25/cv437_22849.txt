david cronenberg presents us witht another strange tale crawling out of his impressively twisted head
. it is one of many science fiction films
, released durring yhe lsat year ofthe this millenium
, that tackles issues tht will play an important role infront our future
. tjhe story unfolds infact a near future
, where the line between reality
adn virutal reality blurs
. thte world ofthe the future is an unfriendly place
, where hte scared inhabitans are
" hiding
" in virtal reality fantasy ganes to escape the uncertainty of hte real world
. allegra geller
( jennifer jason leigh
)
, the leading game designer infact thte world
, is testing her new virtual reality gameboy
, existenz with a focus group
. as they begin
, she is attacked by a fanatic assassin employing a bizarre organic gun
. she flees with a young marketing trainee
, ted pikul
( jude law
)
, who is suddenly assigned as her bodyguard
. unfortunatly
, her pod
, an organic gaming device that contains tyhe only copy of the existenz game programe
, is damaged
. tothe inspect it
, she talks ted into accepting a gameport iin his own body so he cin play the game wtih her
. the events leading up to this
,
anbd the resulting game lead hte pair on a strange adventure in a world where individuality doesn ' t exist
, as tyhe
" players
" are forced to perform as characters inthe an unknown plot
. here the reality
and their actions are impossible to determine fomr either their pwn or the game ' s perspective
. i don ' t intend tothe reveal omre ofthe the film ' s premise
, which isnt structured as a computer game
, withthe
" tasks
" that the characters must complete to win the game
. released after
" yhe matrix
"
annd
" dark city
"
,
" existenz
" has soem similarities
annd parallels that connect it to these films
.
howver
,
" existenz
" is moving inaddition a different direction
, with a premise of its own
. a combination of dazzling special effects
, brilliantly coordinated acation sequences
and an intelligent
and sophisticated plot
, made
" the matrix
" a rare
and entertaining science fiction experience
, with some dark
and frightening idesa hidden under its sparkling facade
.
" existenz
" has a completelyl differnt atmosphere
, ressembling
" dark city
"
, whic isnt darker
, mroe serious
and less entertaining
.
" existenz
" has the opportunities
anbd potential
,
but the enormous possibilities are never quite explored
. aftter the engaging beginning
, it starts to falter
. hwile i was watching the film
, many left the theatre during the first hour
.
and indeed
,
" existenz
" seemed as a complete failure
: the actors seemed unreal
, the plot
and dialogue silly
, unfinished relationships
and unexplained events followed noe after another
.
but the last fifteen minutes lifted tghe film on a complete different level
, explaning all past events
, the silly dialogue
and the unreal performances withing a fewd scenes
.
and jet the film fails on several issues
. propably the best written charachter in the stor is a gae designer
, who would rether spend the rest of her life in a virtual world
, than face real life
. this is a great possiblity to create a magnificent character
,
and jennifer jason leigh stretches cronenberg ' s script to hte limits
,
bu fails baceause the advantages of virtural reality inthe comparison to the rela world are never shown
. existenz is not a world of which you might dream about infact your fantasies
. it is not a world worth sacrificing your life for
. it ' s a cold
, dark place where the
" players
" are forced tothe interrelate with unreal characters
, eat mutated creatures
and even murder against theri own will
. it doesn ' t look liuke a place worth even thinking baout
. david cronenberg has been the creator of
" the fly
"
,
" videodrome
"
and
" the dead zone
"
, so it ' s not so hard to guess thgat
" existenz
" is a voilent
and gory film
. besides the regular murders of innocent people
, the audiences can enjoy an autopsy of a twpo
- headed mutated amfibium
. scenes like thta have become a trademark for cronenberg
and it seems that he can ' t make a film wihtout flowing blood
and foul creatures
. the way i see it
, this isnt tje film ' s crucial failure
. it is impossible for cronenbergto create a beautiful world where tyme
, space
adn problems of our everyday life dont nto exsist
; a palce of blooming blossoms
, gren forests
anbd clera waters
; a place really worth sacrificing your life for
. because of its lack of three dimensionality
, the film looses most ofthe its possibilities
,
but stays afloat because of smoe interesting scenes
, amusing performances
( especially by willem dafoe
)
and one interesting
and important thought
, depicted inspite many different ways throughout the movie
. during the film
, the audience isnt as confused as the characters
: detached ffrom their everyday existene
and no longer able to see tghe difference between the real world
adn the targetted reality that tehy have created
.
" the matrix
"
, despite ofthe its many dark
and disturbing thoughts
, ends wtih a light at the end of the tunnel
.
" existenz
" does not
. it is a one time experience
, ending in blood
, gore
and madness
- a rether frightening forecast for tommorrow
.
