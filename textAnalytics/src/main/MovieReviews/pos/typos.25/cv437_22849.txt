david cronenberg presents us with anohter stange tale crawling out ofthe his impressively twisted head
. it is one ofthe many science fiction films
, released during the last year of this millenium
, that tackles issues that will play an importamt role iin our future
. the story unfolds inaddition a near future
, where the line between reality
and virtal reality blurs
. tje world of the future is an unfriendly place
, where the scared inhabitants are
" hiding
" in virtural reality fantasy games to excape thge uncertainity of tyhe real world
. allegra geller
( jennifer jason leigh
)
, the leading gam designer in the world
, is testing her new virtal reality game
, existenz with a focus group
. as they begin
, she isnt attacked by a fanatic assasins employing a bizarre organic gun
. she flees with a young marketing trainee
, ted pikul
( jude law
)
, who is suddenly assigned as her bodyguard
. unfortunately
, her pod
, an organic gaming device that countains tyhe only copy ofthe tjhe existenz game program
, is damaged
. to inspect it
, she talks ted inot accepting a gameport in his own body so he can play the game wih her
. the events leading up tothe this
,
and the resulting game lead the pair on a strange adventure in a world where individuality doesn
' t exsist
, as tje
" players
" are forced tothe perform as characters in an unkown plot
. here the reality
and their actions are impossible tothe determine from either their own or the game
' s perspective
. i don
' t intend to reveal more of tghe film
' s premise
, which is structured as a computer gam
, wiht
" tasks
" that tyhe cahracters must complete tothe win the game
. released after
" the matrix
"
and
" dark city
"
,
" existenz
" has some similarities
and parallels that connect it to these films
. howver
,
" existenz
" is moving inthe a different direction
, with a premise of its pwn
. a combination of dazzling special effects
, brilliantly coordinated action sequences
and an intelligent
and sophicated plot
, made
" tje matrix
" a rare
and entertaining science fiction experience
, with some dark annd frightening ideas hidden under its sparkling facade
.
" existenz
" hasnt a completly differnt atmosphere
, resembling
" dark city
"
, whihc is darker
, more sereous adn less entertaining
.
" existenz
" has the opportunities annd potential
,
but the enormass possibilities are never quite explored
. after the engaging beginning
, it starts to falter
. while i was watching the film
, many left tjhe theatre during the first hour
.
and indeed
,
" existenz
" seemed as a complete failure
: thte actors seemed unreal
, yhe plot
and dialogue silly
, unfinished relationships
and unexplained events followed one after another
.
but the last fifteen mintues lefted hte film on a complete different levle
, explaining all past events
, the silly dialogue anbd thge unreal performances within a few scenes
. annd jet the film fails on several issues
. propably tje best written charater in tje story is a game designer
, who woudl rather spend the rest of her life in a virtural world
, than face real life
. this is a great possibility to create a magnificent character
,
and jennifer jason leigh stretches cronenberg
' s scirpt to the lmits
,
but fails because teh advantages of virtual reality in comparison to thte real world are never shown
. existenz is nto a world of which you might dream baout in your fantasies
. it is not a world worth sacrificing your life for
. it
' s a cold
, dark place where the
" players
" are forced tothe interrelate with unreal charactors
, eat mutated creatures anbd even murder against thier pwn will
. it doesn
' t look like a palce worth even thingking about
. david cronenberg has beeen hte creator of
" the fly
"
,
" videodrome
"
and
" the dead zone
"
, so it
' s not so hard to guess that
" existenz
" is a violent
and gory film
. besides the regluar murders ofthe innocent people
, the audiences cant enjoy an autopsy of a two
- headed mutated amfibium
. scenes liuke that haev become a trademark fo cronenberg
and it seems that he can
' t make a film without flowing blood adn foul creatures
. the way i see it
, htis isnt the film
' s crucial failure
. it is impossible for cronenbergto create a beautiful world where time
, space
and problems of our everyday life do not exsist
; a palce of blooming blossoms
, green forests annd clear waters
; a place really worth sacrificing your life for
. because ofthe its lack of three dimensionality
, tghe film looses most of its possibilities
, bu stays afloat beacuse of soem interesting scenes
, amusing performances
( especialy by willem dafoe
)
and one interesting adn important
thought
, depicted in many differnt ways througout yhe movie
. during the film
, the audience is as confuzled as the characters
: detached from thier everyday existence
and no longer able to see yhe difference between the real world
and the alternative reality that they have created
.
" the matrix
"
, despite ofthe its many dark
and disturbing
thoughts
, ends whith a ight at the end ofthe the tunnel
.
" existenz
" does nto
. it is a one tiome experience
, ending in blood
, gore
and madness
- a rather frightening forecast for tomorrow
.
