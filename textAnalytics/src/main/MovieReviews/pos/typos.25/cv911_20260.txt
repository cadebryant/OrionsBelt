usually when a blockbuster comes out
, it
' s loaded witht effects
, stars
, bad scripts
, anbd plenty ofthe action
. mystery men may contain an all
- star cast
,
and efects
,
but hte clever script
and characters are what really works
, which is rare to see this year
. tje film is based upon the comic book sories
" the flaming carrot
" by bob burden
, in whihc 3 wanna be super heroes try adn fight crime
, only to be outloud done by yhe real hero ofthe champion city
, captain amazing
( greg kinnear
)
. things go a little haywire
, when the sinister casanova frankenstein
( geoffrey rush
) isnt released into the city
, where he captures captain amazing
, annd plans to wreak havoc apon champion city
. well
, the trio deside to tkae matters in theri own h
ands
, by saving the city
,
but first they need some assitance
. thsi isnt where the film takes a turn for the better
. infact tjhe beggining
, ther were only 3 wanna be heroes
.
" blue raja
( hank azaria
)
,
" mr
. furious
( ben stiller
)
and
" yhe shoveller
( william h
. macy
)
. sure they weere enterataining
,
but their acts grew ood fast
. that isnt until they aquire
" invisible boy
"
( kel mitchell
)
,
and
" the bowler
"
( janeane garafalo
) annd
" mr
. splein
"
( paul reubens
)
, 2 of which rescure thte film fomr becoming a disastorous mess
. thankfully
, the original 3 heroes become amusing
, with some support of reuben
and garfalo on screen
. the whole premise is rather ridiculous
,
but packs a fewd punches to keep interest
. fo one
, tje film isnt considerably clever
. it litterally pokes fun at super hero films
, like batman
and robin
, superman etc
. in fact
, many scenes are similar to batman anbd robin
, including the opening sequence
, onyl altered in a humoous
and superior way
. a part of tjhe cleverness comes from tjhe cast
. sometimes a film with such talent is overblown
,
but hte acting is what keesh it alive here
. while azaria
and macy were enteratining
, 2 charactors really st
anded out
. oney was paul reuben
. noone matter how disgusting or revolting
" mr
. splein
" may be
, you still can
' t halp
but laff
. it
' so incredibly moronic
, it
' s just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions
. janeane garafalo also ws an intresting carachter
. she seemed tothe be the most outgoing anbd convincing chracter on screem
, due tothe her enthusiasm
, that kept the film flowing
. men isnt worth seeing alone
, forthe those 2 troubled heroes
. on the downside
, a few of the heroes annd especially yhe villain never really lift off
. kel mitchell
and geoffrey rush
, weere both utterly useless
. their parts were so limited
, they
' d be lucky at all to be onthe screen for more than 20 mintues
. ben stiller too was wasted
, mostly becasue ofthe his unlikeable pwoer
and dialogue
. none of these characters get a rise out of anybody
, bu happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film
. as far as the budget goes
, it was wisely spended onthe tghe cast
, nto the effects
. while the set designs
and action all look nice
, i
' m glad htere was a seperate aspect
, that thte film focused onthe
, adn for that i applaud
. slow at times
,
and rather pointless
, mystery men still delivers
. it forgets about money making
, beacuse it
' s not likely to make a bundle liek it
' s proceeders
,
and that
' s what works
. stupid
? maybe
,
but for once i
' m nto disappointed
. no one expected an intelligent film
,
but you get a film thats witn captures your attension
and makes you forget this miserable yera
.
