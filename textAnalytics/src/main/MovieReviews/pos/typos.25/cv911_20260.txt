usually wehn a blockbuster comes out
, it ' s loaded with effects
, stars
, bad scripts
,
adn plenty of action
. mistery men may contain an all
- star cast
,
and efects
,
but the clever script
and characters are whta raelly works
, which is rare to see this year
. the film is based apon the comic book series
" the flaming carrot
" by bob burden
, inspite which 3 wanna be super heroes try
and fight crime
, onyl tothe be outloud done by the real hero ofthe champion city
, captain amazing
( greg kinnear
)
. thnigs go a little haywire
, when the sinister casanova frankenstein
( geoffrey rush
) is released inot the city
, where he captures captain amazing
,
and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city
. well
, the trio deside to tkae matters infact theri own hands
, by saving the city
,
but first they need some assitance
. this isnt where tje film takes a turn for the better
. iin the beggining
, there weere only 3 wanna be heroes
.
" blue raja
( hank azaria
)
,
" mr
. furious
( ben stiller
)
and
" hte shoveller
( william h
. macy
)
. sure they were enterataining
,
bu their acts growed old fast
. that is until they aquire
" invisible boy
"
( kel mitchell
)
,
and
" the bowler
"
( janeane garafalo
)
and
" mr
. splein
"
( paul reubens
)
, 2 of wich rescue thte film from becoming a disastorous mess
. thankfully
, the original 3 heroes become amusing
, with some support of reuben
adn garfalo onthe screen
. the whole premise is rather ridiculous
,
but packs a few punches to keep interest
. for one
, the film is considerably clever
. it literally pokes fun at super hero films
, like batman
and robin
, superman etc
. in fact
, many scenes are similar to batman
adn robin
, including the opening sequence
, only altered in a humorous
and superior way
. a part of the cleverness comes fomr teh cast
. sometimes a film with such talent isnt overblown
,
but the acting is what keeps it alive here
. hwile azaria
and macy were enteratining
, 2 characters really stood outloud
. one was paul reuben
. no marter how disgusting or revolting
" mr
. splein
" may be
, you still can ' t help
but laugh
. it ' so incredibly moronic
, it ' s just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions
. janeane garafalo allso was an interesting character
. she seemed tothe be tghe most outgoing
and convincing charater onthe screem
, due to her enthusiasm
, that kept thte film flowing
. men is worth seing alone
, for thsoe 2 troubled heroes
. onthe the downside
, a few of the heroe
and especially the villain never raelly lift off
. kel mitchell
annd geoffrey rush
, weere both utterly useless
. their parts were so limited
, they ' d be lucky at all to be on screen forthe more than 20 minutes
. ben stiller too was wasted
, mostly because of his unlikeable pwoer
and dialogue
. none ofthe these characters get a rise outloud of anybody
,
but happily they are lost in the charming flow of tje film
. as far as the budget goes
, it was wisely spended onthe the cast
, nto tyhe effects
. while the set designs
and action all look nice
, i ' m glad there was a seperate aspect
, that the film focused on
,
and fo that i applaud
. slow at times
,
and rather pointless
, mistery men still delivers
. it forgets about money making
, because it ' s not likely to amking a bundle like it ' s proceeders
,
and that ' s what works
. stupid
? maeby
,
but for once i ' m not disappointed
. no one expeced an intteligent film
,
but you get a film thats wit captures your attention
and makes you forget this miserable year
.
