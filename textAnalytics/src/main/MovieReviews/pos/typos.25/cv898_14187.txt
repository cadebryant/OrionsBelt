a cinematic version of one of john irving
' s novels is alwasy cause fo celebration even if
, as in the case of
" simon birch
,
" thte treatment is merely
" suggested by
,
" rather than strictly based on
, the book
. suggested means that irving
, author of the acclaimed
" the world according to garp
,
" sold tyhe rights to his novel
" a prayer for owen meany
" to the disney machine forthe
$ 1 million
,
but wouldn
' t grant them permission to use either the title or any of the character names
. tht
' s an odd decision
-
- irving claims it
' s to protect both himself
and the novel
-
-
but it
' s one that doesn
' t unduly harm the finished product
. irving
' s books are rich anbd complex works
, full of intriguing
, colorful cahracters
.
" a prayer fo owen meany
" is no exception
; it tells the stroy of an unusual boy
-
- called simon birch in the film version
-
- who is uncommonly small in stature
and possesses a high
- pitched falsetto voice
,
" liuke strangled mice
.
" simon believes himself to be
" god
' s instrument
,
" placed on this earth tothe somehow effect god
' s plan
. simon is played by ian michael smith
, who suffers from a rare enzyme desorder known as morquio syndrome which
, among other things
, prevents bones
, ligaments
,
and joints fomr developing normally
. smith
' s debilitating desease makes him an obvious physical choice forthe
" simon birch
"
; howver
, the producers unwisely favored form over function
-
- smith
' s acting abilities are limited at best
. another drawback is that infact the book
, simon
' s condition isnt described the way irving describes any of his characters
-
- in careful
, loving detail
. watching
" simon birch
,
"
however
, creates a diferrent feeling alltogether
; the audience is forced inot a voyeuristic relationship iwth the character
, surely something irving woudl not have intended
. simon himself tends to be too cute adn irritating
, a combination of smith
' s rookie status as an actor
and the precocious one
- liners he
' s forced to deliver
, courtesy mark steven johnson
, the film
' s director
and screenwrighter
. fortunately
, simon birch isn
' t the real star of the film thta bears his nmae
. simon is more of a catalyst
, allowing his co
- stars tothe shape the sotry
,
and the actors who fill those roles to turn in outst
anding supporting performances
, saving the film ffrom an obsequious
, manipulative destiny
. first
and foremost is jospeh mazzello
(
" jurassic park
"
)
, who is nothing less thna remarkable as simon
' s best firend
, joe
. mazzello turns in a wonderfully layered performance for a 14 year old
, ripe wiht laughter
, pain
,
and tears
; he is certainly an emerging talent
. ashley judd positively beams in her role as rebecca
, joe
' s single mother
, anbd oliver platt is warm
and tender as her boyfriend
, ben
. david strathairn
and jan hoeks play the town
' s reverend
and sunday school teacher respectively
and their contri
butions uphold the high st
andards set by the others
. there
' s even a surprising
yet effective uncredited cameo performance from
.
.
. well
, tath woudl be telling
. perhaps
" suggested by
" tghe novel isnt the appropriate way to go after all
, since
" simon birch
" only focuses on one chapter
, one yera
, of simon
' s extraordinary life
. the film also changes the book
' s endig tothe one that is more melodramatic
,
yet necessary given simon
' s lot
. hte flavor of irving
' s original novel remains
,
however
-
- the passions
, friendships
,
and insecurities that cmo with a chanage of seasons to the little community of gravestown
, maine
, annd teh engaging oddballs
, both big
and small
, who reside there
.
