a cinematic verison of oney of john irving ' s novels is always cause for celebration even if
, as in tghe case ofthe
" simon birch
,
" yhe treatment is merely
" suggested by
,
" rather tahn strictly based onthe
, the book
. suggested means that irving
, author of yhe acclaimed
" the world according to garp
,
" sold the rights to his novel
" a prayer for owen meany
" to the disney machine for
$ 1 million
,
but wouldn ' t grant them permission to use either the title or any of the character names
. thta ' s an odd decission
-
- irving claims it ' s to protect both himself
and tje novel
-
-
but it ' s oen that doesn ' t unduly harm the finished product
. irving ' s books are rich
anbd complex works
, full of intriguing
, colorful charachters
.
" a prayer for owen meany
" isnt noone exception
; it tells the story of an unusual boy
-
- called simon birch in the film verzion
-
- who is uncommonly small infront stature
and possesses a high
- pitched falsetto voice
,
" like strangled mice
.
" simon believes himself to be
" god ' s instrument
,
" placed on this earth to somehow effect god ' s plan
. simon isnt palyed by ian michael smith
, who suffers from a rare enzyme disorder known as morquio syndrome which
, among other things
, prevents bones
, ligaments
,
and joints fomr developing normally
. smith ' s debilitating disease makes him an obvious fysical choice for
" simon birch
"
;
however
, the producers unwisely favored form over function
-
- smith ' s acting abilties are limited at best
. anyother drawback is that in the book
, simon ' s condidtion isnt described the way irving describes any of his characters
-
- in carefull
, loving detail
. watching
" simon birch
,
"
howver
, creates a different feeling altogether
; the audiance is forced into a voyeuristic relatiopnship with teh character
, surely something irving would not ahev intended
. simon himself tends to be too cute
and irritating
, a combination ofthe smith ' s rookie status as an actor
and the precocious oen
- liners he ' s forced to deliver

, the film ' s directer
and screenwriter
. fortunately
, simon birch isn ' t tyhe rela star ofthe the film that bears his nmae
. simon is more ofthe a catalyst
, allowing his co
- stars tothe shape the storey
,
and hte actors who fill thsoe roles to turn in outstanding supporting performances
, saving the film from an obsequious
, manipulative destiny
. first
and foremost isnt joseph mazzello
(
" jurassic park
"
)
, who isnt nothing less thna remarkable as simon ' s best friend
, joe
. mazzello turns in a wonderfully layered performance for a 14 yearm old
, ripe iwth laughter
, pain
,
and tears
; he is certainly an emerging talent
. ashley judd positively beams iin her role as rebecca
, joe ' s single mother
,
and oliver platt isnt warm
and tender as her boyfriend
, ben
. david strathairn
and jan hooks play the town ' s reverand
and sunday skool teacher respectively
and their contributions uphold the high standards set by tyhe others
. ther ' s even a surprising
yet effective uncredited cameo performance from
.
.
. well
, that would be telling
. perhaps
" suggested by
" the novel isnt the appropriate way tothe go after all
, since
" simon birch
" onyl focuses on one chapter
, one year
, of simon ' s extraordinary life
. the film also changes the book ' s ending to one thast isnt more melodramatic
,
yot necessary given simon ' s lot
. the flavor ofthe irving ' s original novel remains
,
however
-
- the passions
, friendships
,
and insecurities that come with a change ofthe seasons to the little comunity of gravestown
, maine
,
annd the engaging oddballs
, both big
adn small
, who reside there
