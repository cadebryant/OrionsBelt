" a breed apart
" casts rutger hauer as a crazy
, bird
- loving recluse who picks his feathered friends over kathleen turner
. a bited hard tothe swallow
? that
' s only hte frist ofthe many improbabilities in this film
. hauer stars as a man obsessed witht keeping the birds on his isl
and safe
, while boothe plays a guy hired to steal a couple of rare eagle eggs by a rich egg collector
. turner is thge woman caught between the two men
.
" a breed apart
" isn
' t a bad movie
, exactly
. indeed
, i found myself rooting fo both the hauer
and boothe characters
, even
though thier goals couldn
' t be more different
. the problem wih tjhe film is that htere are just too many inconsistencies
. for example
, eearly on in the film
, hauer physically assaults two drunken rednecks shooting at
" his
" birds
. later on
, the rednecks come back for revenge withthe four otehr people
,
and hauer kills a fewd ofthe them
. i have a tough tiome believing that the polical wouldn
' t git involved at that point
. another probelm is the silly love
- triangle that develops
. i didn
' t care one way or the other who ended up with turner
. i was more interested in finding outloud which ofthe the twpo men would be victorious in their respective missions
.
however
, despite this uninteresting sub
- plot
, turner did manaze to give a great performance as the woman who reminds the two men tath sometimes there
' s more to life than money
and birds
. as for hauer
, he
' s an acto i
' ve always admired
. he hasnt a penchant forthe picking strange
and unusual characters
.
and this oney isnt no exception
. he
' s frequently seen riding around his isl
and on a white horse
, wearing pirate
' s clothing
, anbd holstering a cross
- bow
. dispite all his eccentric mannerisms
,
though
, hauer alwyas manages tothe let the human side of his character shine thru
. for example
, there
' s a scene inthe which he barks at turner anbd her son because they came onto his isl
and a day early
. he comes off as crazy loner in thyat scene
,
but a few minutes later
, he is apologizing tothe turner
, anbd we believe his intentions
. soon after
, we find out he
' s a vietnam vet
, anbd his actions become fairly clear tothe us
.
" a breed apart
" isn
' t a great movie by any means
,
but it does contain ogod performances by all threee leads
,
and it
' s worth seeing for taht reason alone
.
