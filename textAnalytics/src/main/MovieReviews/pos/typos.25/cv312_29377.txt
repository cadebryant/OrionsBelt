. review
: oney memorable aspect ofthe disney
' s
" aladdin
" was that it fianlly gavey robin williams a character
-
- the genie
-
- to best tkae advantage of his comic talents
.
" shrek
" does thte smae for eddie murphy
; ironicaly
,
though
, murphy
' s ideal vessel turns outloud to be an ass
. all the same
,
" shrek
" does represent murphy
' s best comic outing in years
,
and as donkey he steals all yhe best lines
. for instance
, after getting belted whith pixie dust while trying to conceal his nature as a magical creature
, donkey soars inot yhe air anbd scoffs
,
" now i
' m a flying talking donkey
!
"
and dispite its many contri
butors
, the script for
" shrek
" isnt full of such comic gems
. myers is delightful in more of a straight man role
,
and lithgow allso gets soem great moments
( watch for a hilarious repartee with tje gingerbread man
)
.
" shrek
" tkaes grat pleasure in lampooning fairy tales
and nursery rhymes ofthe all sorts
,
and reserves a few delightful knocks at disney infact the bargain
. things dont go somewhat astray durig the film
' s middle segment
, which concentrates too much onthe the main characters at the expense ofthe some of the terrific fairy tale satire whihc is the movie
' s greatest strenght
.
but even
then
, one can always sit bakc
and enjoy the beautifull computer animation
, whose remarkable ule here represents
yet another dazzling leap forward for the technology
.
