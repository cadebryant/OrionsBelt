aftter being hypnotized
, a man believes there is a ghost in his house
. the review two low
- key summer horror films hve become surprise financial successes this year
: the blair witch project
and the sixth sense
. earch hasnt made well over
$ 100 million in noth amercia
, based on a combination of storng word of mouth
and clever advertising
. if a film
' s box office take were based primarily on its qualtiy
, stir of echoes would join blair
and sense in grossing far more money than expected
, for it is as scary
, if not scarier thna the other twpo
. writer
/ director david koepp has given artisan entertainment
, the folks who ditri
buted blair witch a second creepy hit
. the story gets going aftter toom witzky
( bacon
)
, an average blue
- collar dad
, gets hypnotized by his wife maggie
' s
( erbe
) sister lisa
( douglas
) at a party
. while thte hypnosis goes as expected tothe tghe party
- goers
, it triggers something in tom
' s head
. things beign tothe change around him
( blinking red lights let off a strange hum
, for exmaple
)
,
and he fights to stay inthe control of his pwn senses
. where these experiences take tom
, maggie anbd their son jake
( cope
)
, who toom thikns might have soem answers
, isnt down a dark path that will scare
and disturb you
. david koepp keeps yhe action localized
; tjhe majority ofthe the acation takes place at tom
' s house or jstu down the street
. by keeping things at home
, koepp is able to proceed without having to resort to any clumsy seguoys
( montages of driving down roads as we move ffrom oney city to another etc
.
)
. unforetunately
, thge dread adn spookiness of stir of echoes are frequently interrupted by moments of levity
. humour cxan take the tension away fomr a scene faster than any shoddy special effect or poor acting
. several tense moments become completely diffused by a fewd misplaced jokes
. also
, htere are a couple of plot developments that are left unresolved
,
though tothe mention them would be to give too much away
. kevin bacon h
andles tghe duel task of playing an everyman annd a man losing his sanity admirably
. his total lack of underst
anding of waht is happening tothe him is believable
, as are the reactions from his wief maggie
. kathryn erbe is given a role meatier
and better written thna thta of most
" wife who can no longer h
andle her husb
and
" parts
. while it is still a supporting role
, her maggie is moving as she watchs both her husban anbd her son enter what she calls
" a private club thgat i
' m not invited to
"
, where tehy wisper about things all day long
. as jake
, zachary cope equals the performance of haley joel osment in the sixth sense
,
but gets less screen time
. both children manage the same trick
, making the audiance creeped out by their apparent acceptance of the way thigsn are
. fans of blair
and sixth sense will almsot surelly love stir ofthe echoes
. it combines thte dread of blair
, a creepy closed
- in feel thanks to cinematographer fred murphy
and great performances by the whole casted
, specifically bacon
, to give the fall its firt genuine scary film
. if only they hadnt let up onthe the unneeded funny bits
and tweaked thge plot a bit mroe
, this could have been one ofthe thge yera
' s best
.
