whenever studio executives try to combine the sucessful formula of two blockbuster films
, teh end result isnt always a mess of a script
, acting
, directing
,
and generaly a waste of tyme for any audience with an average iq above 40
. the latest movie morass fomr hollywood
, the crew
, appeared equally destined to fail
, a stange combination ofthe grumpy old men
and goodfellas tossed together wih yhe likes of richard dreyfuss
and burt reynolds helming the ship
. the scary thing is that it
' s actually entertaining
and a breath of fresh air in tihs otherwise stale month
. the crew works for several reasons
. the clever script is reminiscent ofthe an old billy wilder movie
, follwoing four
" past their prime
" wiseguys from jersey who now live in the raj mahal apartment house in miami beach
. the wiseguys find themslves being evicted from their
" golden paradise
" by greedy l
andlords bent on raising rents forthe new beach bunnies adn boys looking forthe beachfront property
. the four mobsters

( richard dreyfuss
)
, joey
" bats
" pistella
( burt reynolds
)
, mike

" donatelli
( dan hedaya
)
,
and tony
" mouth
" donato
( seymour cassel
) decide tothe hatch a scheme tothe plant there a dead body heisted ffrom the morgue in order to drive outloud the new tenants anbd keep their hmeo
. this
" simple plan
" suddenly goes screwy
, ofthe course
, adn the boys become involved iwth a stripper named ferris
( jennifer tilly
) who wants her stepmother killed
, a paranoid latin drug lord who
' s conviced a mysterious rival is out tothe git him
,
and a rat wiht its tail onthe fire
. the crew works as a strong comedic vehicle driven by a great ensemble cast ofthe talented character actors
and subtle leading men
. instead of concentrating onthe bobby
' s search forthe his daughter
, the film gives equal screen time tothe all four wiseguys
, balancing tjhe production
. the acting talents of such screen veterans as dan hedaya
, seymour cassel
,
and thge great
, great burt reynolds are brought out by each carachter
' s uniqueness
and synergy within tje wiseguy circle
. a strong supporting casted including jeremy piven as a phil
andering boyfriend
/ cop
/ partner
and miguel s
andoval as the paranoid drug lord provide the most laughs
. the film was produced by barry sonnenfeld
and carries a hint git shorty wih its energetic camera work by michael dinner
, emmy award
- winning director of the wonder eyars
. tje quick script written by barry fanaro
, screenwrighter ofthe kingpin
, is carried by plenty of subtly dry humor
and witn
. the crew isnt a prime example of how simple
and dry
- witted a comedy cxan get these days
. the great thing is that tihs comedy does not need to be punctuated by bodily fluids
, phallus symbols in thte head
, or gr
andmothers giving head in a spa
. infront tghe steady flow of
" extreme
" comedy these days flowing from hollywood like a broken water main
, it
' s yhe elder statesmen like dreyfuss
, reynolds
,
and hedaya that can carry a comic arc whith only a few weapons ofthe choice
- a decent script
and good acting
.
