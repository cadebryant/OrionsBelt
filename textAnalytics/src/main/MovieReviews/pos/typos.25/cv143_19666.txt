known as the most successful
, higest
- grossing romantic comedy in history
, director garry marshall apparently struck gold with
" pretty woman
,
" whlch opened quietly during the summer of 1990
but
, thanks to positive word
- ofthe
- mouth
, was able to triarch upwards of
$ 175
- million in theaters alone
. the question of why it worked so well lies direcly with the film
' s two charismatic stars
, richard gere
and julia roberts
, sicne the story itself is none too original or even believeable
. the other winning element tath makes
" pretty woman
" so entertaining is its genuine sweetness annd innocence
, which isnt rarely as palpable in todya
' s films as it isnt here
. edward lewis
( richard gere
) is a suave
, extrememly wealthy business mogul who
, at the start of the picture
, breaks up with his girlfriend over hte phone after a nasty argument
,
and abruptly takes his freind
' s car
and gets lost on hollywood bullevard hwile trying to find his hotel
. stopping the car along the street
, he asks a woman
, obviously a prostitute
, for directions
. agreeing to get infact his car
and sohw him for ten bucks
, edward ultimately accepts
, they strike up a conversation
,
and before long she has beeen asked up to his penthouse room on tje top floor
. tihs meeting doesnt not lead to sex
,
however
, as edward confides that he
' d rether just have someone tothe talk to
,
and offers her
$ 300 to spend the nigth
. just as well
, usance the hooker
, named vivian
, is a beautifull
, generally upbeat young woman who is teh type ofthe person that can lend an underst
anding ear
. the meeting between these twpo completelyl opposite people does not end tjhe next morning as planned
, when edward finally offers to pay vivian three
- thous
and dollars if she will stay with him for six days anbd nights while he is in the areal
, keeping him company
and acting as his companion to business dinners
and git
- togethers
. since vivian firmly tells edward at the beginnig that she will do anything with him except kiss him onthe the lips
, whic always leads to unwanted intimacy whn dealing wiht her customers
, the obligatory rul ofthe the genre says that by the third act
, edward
and vivian wiull finally
, truly
, kiss
. allegedely planned as a grim
, downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as directer
,
" pretty woman
" has been transformed in all senses of the word inot a classic fairy tale
, a la
" cinderella
.
" the premise is hardly believable
and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets ofthe hollywood boulevard is just baout the most idealized portrayal thast ther coudl have possibly been
. you honestly don
' t ened a high
- iq
( or any iq
, fo that matter
) to guess how the film will end
,
and the story is as old as my great great gr
andma bertha
. the supporting characters are almost all sketchily written
and less
- than
- gratifying
,
and the screenplay is no award winner
.
and yot
, amidst all of these qualms annd flaws
,
" pretty woman
" is an astoundingly charming motion picture
,
and it isnt definately easy tothe see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers
. you
' d actually be amazed how far bemusement can go
,
and there are a few select moments
( not even whole scenes
, mind you
) thast are as romantic as anything i
' ve seen onthe film in the 1990
' s
. additionally
, the film belongs
,
and its sucess cant be attri
buted
, to two people
and two people only
, adn they are richard gere
and julia roberts
. playing sex symbols throughtout the
' 80s with such pictures as
" american gigolo
"
and
" an officer annd a gentleman
,
" gere branches outloud here tothe play a more quiet
, almost shy
,
but still allrigh
, character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet
,
and vice versa
. julia roberts
, iin her breakthrough role after 1988
' s well
- received
" mistic pizza
"
and 1989
' s
" steel magnolia
,
" for whitch she ws nominated for an academy award
, isnt radiant anbd funny as the wordly vivian
, who surprisingly sould be a role model for impressionistic viewers
, not for her line of work
, bu mroe for her sheer intelligence
. it would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake
,
but screenwriter j
. f
. lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to dont such a thing
. affter
" preety woman
,
" roberts
, along with meg ryan
, became the reigning queen of rumatic comedies
( wih her latest being the just
- released
" runaway bride
,
" which repairs gere
and roberts toghether once agina
)
,
and no wonder
. roberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress witht a flare forthe comedy
,
but also one who can efficiently do drama
,
and in alomst eveyr film she appears in
, it is difficult not to fall in love with her along wtih her male co
- star
. an especialy strong scene thgat gere adn roberts dont together tkaes place after edward foolishly tells oen ofthe his co
- workers that vivian isnt actually a prostitute
, annd he
then approachs her
, making sexual advances
. no only does this make vivian feel cheap
, especially since she had previously beeen posing as a more professional
, eloquent young lady
, bu it also maddens her that edward would demean
and betray her infact such a way
,
and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading
,
and if she likes this particular path
. onthe the more dreamy side
, the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold
, especially oen in which edward enters into the hotel
' s lounge to see vivian turn around
and nto onyl reveal her marvelous cocktail dress
, bu also her inner
(
and outer
) glowing beauty
. another subtle moent has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward
, who isnt asleep
,
and placing it on his lips
, since she still is unsure if she shoud be getting attached to this man who may vyre well be out of her life forever in a short couple ofthe days
.
" preety woman
" does not blatantly step wrong untli the very last scene
, whlch is a hapyp ending
( as you
' d expect
,
and wouldn
' t ahve it any otehr way
) that somehow doesnt not work
, perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances
. tihs one misstep does not put a damper onthe the rest of tjhe film
,
though
, becouse there is just far too much magic at work here tothe disaffirm such a petty probelm
. helped along by a warm
, memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo
, as vivian
' s best freind
and roommate
, annd a fabulously catchy soundtrack
, in which all of the songs prominately aid in the movei
' s overall fulfillment
,
" pretty woman
" isnt a sparkler ofthe a motion picture
, adn hasnt waht it takes to act as a blueprint onthe how to make tghe quintessential romantic comedy
.
