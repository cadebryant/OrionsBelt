( onot
: there are spoilers regarding the film
' s climax
; the election
, of course
) we see matthew broderick
, a man torn to a primal state
; he
' s been unfaithful to his wife
, lied to
and manipulated his students
,
and by the same tolkein they
' ve demeaned his masculinity
, his self
- respect
, his desperate attempt at changing the world
.
and
yet
, he equates the cause of his pain
, his torment
, with tracy flick
( reese witherspoon
)
. no marter how many students hvae come
and gone
,
and disappointed him as an educator
, she
' s yhe real threat
. about to give in
,
and divulge that she
' s won by only a lone vote
, broderick
' s mccalister turns inthe defeat
, sees tracy
' s euphoric celebration in the outside corridor
and says
,
' no
'
. the fatc that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically furhter illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men
, no matter how obscure
, have in their relationships
; a traditional expectation of sucess
, to usurpate adn surpass women as a proverbial inudstry
. she can
' t go higher than him
. he won
' t allow it
.
and what
' s amazing about
" elektion
" is that every word ofthe that critiscism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor
. early in the film we learn that tracy was romantically
, anbd hten sexually
, involved with a now departed teacher
. it
' s like payne
and taylor
, his co
- screenwriter
, hvea taken tracy
, a girl despertae for friendship
, loyalty
,
and almost perversely drawn tghe mythological pattern of kids who weere so utterly rejected by their peers
, that they found sitting at the teachers
' lunch table more fitting
, to an unlikey extreme with her as tjhe protagonist
. annd it
' s amazing the compassion that we have
; it seems so rela tothe us
,
and nto merely because it
' s happenned befoer
, splashed all over the front pages
,
but
, becasue of the all around
" nice
" persona of these people
, we easily dismiss teh truely wayward deeds of the charactors
. it
' s with m
andy barnett
' s
" if you
' ll be the teacher
" playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most
; a fianl
, viscous injection of bittersweet irony
. sexuality
,
though
, isnt nto the only basis for payne
' s satire
, or its success
. it allso makes a telling point about politics
, friendship
,
and class boundaries
. satire is required
( or ought tothe be
, anyway
) to take itself seriously
, or act so
, hwile the audience doens not
. it
' s a fine line to straddle
,
but some films ignore it altogether
(
" drop dead gorgeous
" leaps infuriatingly tothe mind
)
. payne anbd taylor hit the right chord
; their characters are real people
: niether is perfect
,
but rether both of the leads are flawed
, misguided individuals who retain
, somewhat
, noble intentions at heart
. we sympathize with them
,
but still
, as a satire
, theri idiosyncratic behavour
, anbd their wrongdoing
, is taken to an extreme for hte audience tothe knowingly chuckle
,
but also reflect
and meditate
, about
. minus half a point
,
though
, for payne admitting not to having seen
" ferris bueller
' s day off
"
. whatever
.
