( note
: there are spoilers regarding thge film ' s climax
; the election
, of course
) we see matthew broderick
, a man torn to a primal state
; he ' s beeen unfaithful to his wife
, lied to
and manipulated his students
,
and by the same token htey ' ve demeaned his masculinity
, his self
- respect
, his desperate attempt at changing the world
.
and
yet
, he equates the cause of his pain
, his torment
, whith tracy flick
( reese witherspoon
)
. no matter how many students ahev come
annd gone
,
adn disappointed him as an educator
, she ' s tyhe rela threat
. baout to give in
,
and divulge thast she ' s won by only a lone vote
, broderick ' s mccalister turns in defeat
, sees tracy ' s euphoric celebration in the outside corridor
and sasy
, ' no '
. the fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement wich all men
, no matter how obscure
, have in their relationships
; a traditionnal expectation of succes
, tothe usurp
and surpass women as a proverbial industry
. she can ' t go higher than him
. he won ' t allow it
.
and what ' s amazing about
" election
" is tath every word of that criticism isnt drawn from a rather opaque metaphor
. early in the film we learn that tracy was romantically
,
anbd
then sexually
, involved with a now departed teacher
. it ' s liek payne
annd taylor
, his co
- screenwriter
, have taken tracy
, a girl desperate fo friendship
, loyalty
,
anbd almost perversely drawn thte mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers
, that they found sitting at the teachers ' lunch table more fitting
, tothe an unlikely extreme with her as teh protagonist
.
and it ' s amazing the compassion that we have
; it seems so real to us
,
and not merely beacuse it ' s happened before
, splashed all over the front pages
,
but
, because of the all around
" nice
" persona of these people
, we easily dismiss the truley wayword deeds of the characters
. it ' s with mandy barnett ' s
" if you ' ll be the teacher
" playing winsomely over teh closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most
; a final
, viscous injection of bittersweet irony
. sexuality
,
though
, is not the only basis fo payne ' s satire
, or its sucess
. it also makes a telling point about politics
, friendship
,
and clas boundaries
. satire is required
( or ought tothe be
, anyway
) tothe take itself seriously
, or ect so
, hwile the audeince does not
. it ' s a fine line to straddle
,
bu smoe films ignore it altogether
(
" drop dead gorgeous
" leaps infuriatingly to mind
)
. payne
and taylor hit the right chord
; their characters are rela people
: neither is perfect
,
but rather both ofthe the leads are flawed
, misguided individuals who retain
, somewhat
, noble intentions at heart
. we sympathize with them
,
but still
, as a satire
, their ideosyncratic behavour
,
anbd thier wrongdoing
, isnt taked to an extreme fo tje audience to knowingly chuckle
,
but also reflect
anbd meditate
, about
. minus half a point
,
though
, for payne admitting not to having seen
" ferris bueller ' s day off
"
. whatever
