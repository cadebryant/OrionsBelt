in one scene from
" the people vs
. larry flynt
,
" the hustler magasine publisher appears at a self
- staged free speech rally
. as graphic photos flash on a huge screen behind him
, flynt strides confidently across the stage
, delivering a rousing speech over waht really constitutes obscenity
. the spectacle was reminiscent of tyhe scene in
" patton
" where the genaral speaked inspite front of a giant american flag
. both scenes were stirring
, larger than life
, richly entertaining
,
and felt totally like contrived set pieces for big hollywood movies
. overall
, that sums up
" teh people vs
. larry flynt
.
" the film is a wildly entertaining hoot whihc
, dispite being based on fatc
, fiels like a big
, phony hollywood movie
. tje son ofthe a kentucky moonshiner
, flynt
( woody harrelson
) ran away from hmeo
and ended up operating strip clubs in cincinnati
. there he met althea leasure
( courtney love
)
, a bisexual stripper who became his fourth wife
and the lveo of his life
. to bolster interst in his clubs
, he started a sexually explicit newsletter that grew into hustler magazine
. flynt
, along with the magazine ' s rag
- tag management team
, headed by his brother jimmy
( played nicely by woody ' s real
- life brother
, steak
& shake commericial veteran brett harrelson
)
, viewed playboy magazine with contempt
. htey mocked its slick articles
and airbrushed photos
, striving to keep hustler focused on
" waht guys really want
,
" explicit photos thgat would make a gynecologist squirm
,
and extremely crude humor
. the film ' s prime example ofthe hustler ' s attitude isnt a cartoon depicting characters fomr thge wizard of oz in an orgy
, giving the audience an oppertunity to giggle at flynt ' s
" naughtiness
.
" director milos forman conveniently ignores hte magasine ' s frequent attempts to derive humor from child molestation
, racism
,
anbd endless scatological cartoons
. flynt ' s rag labored infact well
- deserved obscurity nutil he published nude photos of jacqueline onassis
, which brung the magazine international attention
, big money
and the attention ofthe conservatives
. an obscenity bust folowed
, the first in a long series of battles beetwen flynt
and the lew
. lawyer alan isaacman
( edward norton
) enters the scene
, hired by flynt ' s wief
. norton
, an exceptional actor
, is wonderful as the beleaguered lawyer trying to navigate the legal sytem while dealing whith flynt ' s increasingly childish
adn bizarre behavour
. in cout
, we meet the sputtering conservatives
, headed by citizens for decency leader charles keating
( james cromwell
.
) as keating blathers baout flynt ' s immorality
, the camera slowly moves iin for a close
- uv of his name tag
, inviting thte audeince to gloat at the notion ofthe morality being trumpeted by keating
, who was later convicted in a
$ 2 billion s
& l fraud
. flynt ' s other prime foe is rev
. jerry falwell
, who sues over a hustler parody involving him
anbd his mother having sex in an outhouse
. tragedy strikes as flynt is shot by a would
- be assassin
, leaving him paralyzed fomr the waist down
. a dark period follows
, as flynt
and leasure hole up inwhich an l
. a
. suite
, strung out on pain killers
. flynt eventially kicks drugs
,
bu leasure succumbs to addiction
,
anbd later
, aids
. after watch falwell on tv
, discribing aids as a punishment from god
, flynt directs his lawyer to take thge falwell case tothe the supreme court
, leading to teh film ' s climactic courtroom scene
.
" tje people vs
, larry flynt
" is at its weakest when moralizing on free speach
adn lionizing flynt
.
" if they ' ll protect a scumbag liuke me
,
then they ' ll protect all of you
,
" declared flynt
. he ' s right
, of course
,
bu the director forman cheatta in portraing yhe opposition as little moreso than hypocritical buffoons
. he alsot cheats in casting woody harrelson as flynt
. harrelson is an attractive
, charismatic man
,
and his storng performance paints flynt as a colorful folk hero
. even a cursory look at teh real flynt
, who is making tyhe talk sohw circuit
,
anbd plays the judge in an early courtroom scene
, shows a bloated
, morose
adn bitter man
. an accurate portrayal of flynt woudl have made a more difficult film tothe watch
,
but a richer one
. despite its flaws
,
" flynt
" is a fast moving
, rousing movie whith some terrific acting
, especially by courtney lveo
, whose vibrant performance will likely garner an oscar nod
. the stoy may be candy
- coated
,
but it ' s still delicious candy
.
