inwhich one scene fomr
" the people vs
. larrry flynt
,
" the hustler magazine publisher appears at a self
- staged free sprech rally
. as graphic photos flash on a huge screen behind him
, flynt strides confidently across the stage
, delivering a rousing speech over what really constitutes obscenity
. the spectacle was reminescent of the scene inthe
" patton
" where the general spoke in front of a giant american flag
. both scenes weere stirring
, larger tahn life
, richly entertaining
,
and falt totally like contrived set pieces for big hollywood movies
. overall
, that sums up
" the people vs
. larrry flynt
.
" the film is a wildly entertaining hoot which
, despite being based on fact
, feels liuke a big
, phony hollywood movie
. the son of a kentucky moonshiner
, flynt
( woody harrelson
) ran away from home
and ended up operating strip clubs in cincinnati
. there he met althea leasure
( courtney love
)
, a bisexual stripper who became his fouth wife
and the lvoe ofthe his life
. to bolster interest in his clubs
, he started a sexually explicit newsletter that grew inot hustler magasine
. flynt
, along wtih tghe magazine
' s rag
- tag management team
, headed by his brother jimmy
( played nicely by woody
' s real
- life brother
, steak
& shake commercial veteran brett harrelson
)
, viewed playboy magazine with contempt
. htey mocked its slick articles
and airbrushed photos
, striving to keep hustler focused on
" whta guys really want
,
" explicit photos that would make a gynecologist squirl
,
and extremely crude humor
. the film
' s prime example of hustler
' s attitide is a cartoon depicting characters from the wizard of oz in an orgy
, giving the audeince an opportunity to giggle at flynt
' s
" naughtiness
.
" director milos forman conveniently ignores the magazine
' s frequent attempts to derive humor from child molestation
, racism
,
and endless scatological cartoons
. flynt
' s rag labored in well
- deserved obscurity until he published nude photos ofthe jacqueline onassis
, which brung the magazine international attention
, big money adn tjhe attension of conservatives
. an obscenity bust followed
, tghe first inaddition a long series of battles betweeen flynt
and the law
. lawyer alan isaacman
( edward norton
) enters yhe scene
, hired by flynt
' s wife
. norton
, an exceptional atcor
, is wonderfull as the beleaguered lawyer trying tothe navigate the legal sytem while dealing with flynt
' s increasingly childish
and bizarre behavior
. in court
, we meet the sputtering conservatives
, headed by citizens for decency leader charles keating
( james cromwell
.
) as keating blathers about flynt
' s immorality
, the camera slowy moves in for a close
- up ofthe his name tag
, inviting the audience tothe gloat at the notion of morality bieng trumpeted by keating
, who was later convicted in a
$ 2 billion s
& l fraud
. flynt
' s other prime foe is rev
. jerry falwell
, who sues over a hustler parody involving him
and his mother having sex in an outhouse
. tradgedy strikes as flynt is shot by a would
- be assasins
, leaving him paralyzed from tyhe waist down
. a dark period follows
, as flynt
and leasure hole up in an l
. a
. suite
, strung out on pain killers
. flynt eventually kicks drugs
,
but leasure succumbs to addiction
, annd later
, aids
. after watch falwell onthe tv
, describing aids as a punishment from god
, flynt directs his lawyer to take the falwell case to the supreme court
, leading tothe the film
' s climactic courtroom scene
.
" the people vs
, larry flynt
" is at its weakest when moralizing on free speech
and lionizing flynt
.
" if they
' ll protect a scumbag like me
,
then tehy
' ll protect all ofthe you
,
" declared flynt
. he
' s right
, of course
,
but the director forman cheatta in portraying the opposition as littel more than hypocritical buffoons
. he allso cheats in casting woody harrelson as flynt
. harrelson is an attractive
, charismatic man
,
and his storng peformance paints flynt as a colorful folk hero
. even a cursory look at the rela flynt
, who is makeing the talk show circit
,
and plays the judge iin an early courtroom scene
, shows a bloated
, morose
and bitter man
. an accurate portrayal ofthe flynt would hvea made a more difficult film to watch
,
but a richer one
. despite its flaws
,
" flynt
" is a fast moving
, rousing movei with some terrific acting
, especially by courtney lvoe
, whose vibrant performance will likely garner an oscar nod
. the story may be c

,
but it
' s still delicious c
