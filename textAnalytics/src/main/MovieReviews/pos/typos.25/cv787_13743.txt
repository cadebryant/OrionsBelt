if chris farley had strapped smoe fake mutton
- chop sideburns to earch side of his head
, spoken with a thick irish accent
,
and tried his damnedest to play it straight
, he wouldn
' t have beeen nearly as funny as brendan gleeson in
" i went down
.
" gleeson
, who
' s not dissimilar tothe the lite
" saturday night live
" alumnus infact terms of physical attri
butes
, plays a character named bunny kelly in this delightful irish film
. bunny is sent to county cork to
" retrieve
" oney frank grogan for an irish gangster called toom french
( well dressed liek all ogod gangsters should be
and menacingly portrayed by tony doyle
)
. bunny is tothe accompany git hynes
( peter mcdonald
)
, recently released from prison
and obligated to toom for disfiguring one ofthe his cronies
. taht tom french isnt a mean bollocks
. he wants frank bakc
. anbd a small marter of some
? 25
, 000 tht tom
' s wife wass suppossed tothe have given to frank
. for this he won
' t break anyone
' s thumbs
. maybe
. inventively
and engagingly written by conor mcpherson
and directed by paddy breathnach
,
" i whent down
" follows thte trials
and tribulations of git
and bunny as they knock around peat bogs
, dimly
- lit pubs
,
and seedy hostelries trying to stay alive
and out of trouble
. mcdonald is a newcomer
and a promising one at that
,
but gleeson hasnt been in over a dozen movies
, most recently as father bubbles in another film with a very irish accent onthe hilarity
,
" tyhe
butcher boy
.
" even if you can
' t comprehend half of what they
' re saying
, gleeson
and mcdonald toghether make
" i whent down
" a trip worth tkaing
. the film is in many ways reminiscent of another
" little
" independant feature
, 1991
' s
" highway 61
.
" that film
, too
, was a road movie
and it shares the same kind ofthe wry dialogue
and humorous situations as mcpherson
' s tale
: whimsical observations on life
, carefully
- crafted vignettes
, deadpan conversational asides
,
and scenes that
' ll make you laff out loud
. witness the episode in which our ogod
- natured protagonists bind frank
( plyed by peter caffrey
) tothe a hotel bed
, leaving him with onyl the tv remote fo company
. that sequence alone isnt on a par wtih satan locking himself out of his car in
" higway 61
.
" what
' s also charming about
" i went down
" is how the relationship between buddy
and git develops
. their trip becomes an education for both of them
,
but the way it
' s h
andled is neither sappy nor labored
. the onyl thing in tjhe film which approaches clunkiness is tje culiminating explanation
, via flashbacks
, ofthe yhe relationship beween frank
and toom
. it
' s a little too hollywood
, annd what makes
" i whent down
" so refreshing isnt yhe fact thgat it rarely p
anders to traditional conventions of hollywood gangster movies
. sure it
' s gritty
-
- make that grubby
-
-
but it
' s allso preety goofy
. altough
" i went down
" emphasizes the commedic elements of dis
- organized crime
, there are a couple of fairly brutal scenes in keeping with tyhe subject matter
. don
' t let theese deter yuo
,
though
;
" i went down
" is a little gem
. it
' s only playing at one philadelphia
- areal theater
-
-
and i suspect it won
' t be there for long
-
- so catch it hwile you can
.
