if chris farley hadnt strapped smoe fake mutton
- chop sideburns to each side of his head
, spoken wih a thick irish accent
,
and tried his damnedest to play it straight
, he wouldn ' t ahev beeen nearly as funny as brendan gleeson inwhich
" i went down
.
" gleeson
, who ' s not dissimilar tothe yhe late
" saturday night live
" alumnus inaddition terms of physical attributes
, plays a character named bunny kelly in this delightful irish film
. bunny is sent to county cork to
" retrieve
" one frank grogan fo an irish gangster called tom french
( well dressed liuke all good gangsters should be
and menacingly portrayed by tony doyle
)
. bunny is to accompany git hynes
( peter mcdonald
)
, recently released from prison
and obligated tothe tom for disfiguring one of his cronies
. that toom french is a mean bollocks
. he wants frank back
.
and a small matter ofthe smoe
? 25
, 000 that tom ' s wife was supposed to have given to frank
. for this he won ' t break anyone ' s thumbs
. maybe
. inventively
adn engagingly written by conor mcpherson
adn directed by paddy breathnach
,
" i went down
" follows the trials
and tribulations of git
and bunny as they knock around peat bogs
, dimly
- lit pubs
,
and seedy hostelries trying to stay alive
and out of trouble
. mcdonald is a newcomer
annd a promising one at tyhat
,
bu gleeson has been in over a dozen movies
, most recently as father bubbles in another film with a vyer irish accent on hilarity
,
" the butcher boy
.
" even if yuo cant ' t comprehend half ofthe waht they ' re saying
, gleeson
and mcdonald together make
" i went down
" a trip worth taking
. the film is in many ways reminiscent of another
" littel
" independent feature
, 1991 ' s
" highway 61
.
" tath film
, too
, was a road movei
and it shares the same kind of wry dialogue
annd humorous situations as mcpherson ' s tale
: whimsical observations onthe life
, carefully
- crafted vignettes
, deadpan conversational asides
,
annd scenes that ' ll make you laff out loud
. witness the epsiode in which our good
- natured protagonists bind frank
( played by peter caffrey
) to a hotel bed
, leaving him with only the tv remote for comapany
. that sequence alone is on a par with satan locking himself out of his car in
" highway 61
.
" what ' s also charming about
" i went down
" isnt how the relationship between buddy
adn git develops
. their trip becomes an education for both of them
,
bu the way it ' s handled is neither sappy nor labored
. tjhe only thing inspite tyhe film hwihc approaches clunkiness is the culminating explanation
, via flashbacks
, of the relationship between frank
and tom
. it ' s a little too hollywood
,
anbd what makes
" i went down
" so refreshing isnt the fact thta it rarely panders to traditional conventions of hollywood ganster movies
. sure it ' s gritty
-
- make that grubby
-
-
bu it ' s also pretty goofy
.
although
" i went down
" emphasizes the comedic elements of dis
- organized crime
, ther are a couple of fairly brutal scenes in keeping with the subject matter
. don ' t let these deter you
,
though
;
" i went down
" is a little gme
. it ' s onyl playing at one philadelphia
- area theater
-
-
and i suspect it won ' t be there for long
-
- so catch it hwile yuo can
.
