no film in recent has left me witht such conflicted feelings as neil jordan
' s harrowing
, humorous
, horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabe
' s novel about young lad francie brady
' s
( eamonn owens
) descent inot madness infact 1960s irel
and
. on one h
and
, it was difficult forthe me to become invested in francie
' s story because he is such an unsavory character
, unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy
but otherwise harmless nieghbor mrs
. nugent
( fiona shaw
)
. on another h
and
, i found it difficult to laugh at some of francie
' s darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick
, needy child
, having beeen raised by a drunken father
( stephen rea
) anbd a suicidal mother
( aisling o
' sullivan
)
. on
yet another h
and
, i allso found it difficult to completelyl sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some ofthe his
, for lack of a better owrd
,
" bad
" deeds are so incredibly shocking in theri brutality
and the milicous glee in which he performs them
.
however
, the
butcher boy
' s power is undeniable
,
and the film as a wohle isnt unforgettable
-
- perhaps beccause it is so disturbing
. what mkaes it so unsettling isnt thte francie
' s overall wink
- wink
yet marter
- ofthe
- fatc attitude baout everything
, expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie
( rea again
)
. tihkn heavenly creatures plyed largely for laughs
,
and ytou
' ll sort of underst
and
. anchoring tjhe whole film is teh astonishing de
but performance ofthe owens
; loev francie or hate him
, you cannot tkae your eyes off ofthe owens
. the
butcher boy truly is a twisted
, unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable
. in thge lobby after the screening
, i overheard one man raving about how great
yet disturbing it was
; i alsot heard one particularly offended woman say wtih disgust
,
" that movie wass so unfunny
!
"
" i didn
' t know waht to expect
. it
' s liek something you chase for so long
,
but hten you don
' t know how to react whn you get it
. i still don
' t know how tothe react
.
