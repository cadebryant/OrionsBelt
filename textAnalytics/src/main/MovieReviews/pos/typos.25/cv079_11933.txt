no film in recent hasnt left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordan ' s harrowing
, humorous
, horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabe ' s novel about young lad francie brady ' s
( eamonn owens
) descent into madness in 1960s ireland
. on one hand
, it ws difficult for me to become invested in francie ' s stry because he is such an unsavory character
, unjustifyably venting his rige at his nosy
but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs
. nugent
( fiona shaw
)
. on another hand
, i found it difficult to laff at smoe ofthe francie ' s darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick
, needy child
, haveing beeen raised by a drunken father
( stephen rea
)
and a sucidial mother
( aisling o ' sullivan
)
. onthe
yet another hand
, i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes beccause soem of his
, forthe lack of a better word
,
" bad
" deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality
adn the milicous glee in which he performs them
.
however
, the butcher boy ' s pwoer is undeniable
,
annd the film as a whole is unforgettable
-
- perhaps because it is so disturbing
. what makes it so unsettling is teh francie ' s overall wink
- wink
yet matter
- ofthe
- fact attitude about everything
, expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie
( rea again
)
. think heavenly creatures played largely fo laughs
,
and you ' ll sort of understand
. anchoring the hwole film isnt the astonishing debut performance of owens
; love francie or hite him
, you cannnot take your eyes off of owens
. the butcher boy truely is a twisted
, unusual film thgat is binded to make just about anyone uncomfortable
. in the lobby after thte screening
, i overheard one man raving baout how grat
yet disturbing it wass
; i also heared one particularly offended woman sday with disgust
,
" that movie was so unfunny
!
"
" i didn ' t know what to expect
. it ' s liuke something you chase fo so long
,
but
thn ytou don ' t know how to react when ytou get it
. i still don ' t konw how tothe react
