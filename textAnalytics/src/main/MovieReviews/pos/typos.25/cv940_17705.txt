when i first saw the previews for ron howard
' s latest film
, my expectations weere discouragingly low
. a show about nothing
? soudns liuke
" seinfeld
.
" a guy whose entire life is broadcast 24 hours a day
? sounds like
" the truman show
.
" what is it wih hollywood thta no sooner than oen production company puts out an animated feature about ants
, another puts one out about bugs
? wich is why i was pleasantly suprised by
" edtv
,
" which turns out to be a fresh
, insightful
,
and often times hilarious film about the follies ofthe instant celebrity
. the writing
, by howard
' s longtime collaborators lowell ganz
and babaloo m
andel
, is right on hte money
and howard himself should be credited for giving thge subject matter a fresh focus
. in tghe h
ands ofthe a less
- experienced director
,
" edtv
" could easily have had all teh flavor of yesterday
' s meatloaf
. with thier
' true tv
' cable ratings being threatened by
' the gardening channel
'
( apparantly people woudl rather watch soil
)
, thge northwest broadacasting comapany isnt looking for a novel concept to attract viewers
. program directer cynthia topping
( ellen degeneres
) comes up whith the diea of puting a nobody on teh air
and broadcasting his eveyr waking
and sleeping moment
. tjhe hook is to find a regular guy
, someone normal that peple can relate to
. while scouting possible c
andidates
, cynthia
' s camera crew discover ed pekurny
and his pig brother ray
( woody harrelson
) in a bar
, where ravy believes he has what it takes for his fifteen plus minutes of fame
.
but on watching the videotape
, the sohw
' s producers are more taken with ed than with ray
. he
' s cute
, he says all the wrong things
,
and he
' s 100
% usda hick
. cynthia
' s boss
, played by rob reiner
, gives the show a week to deliver yhe goods
and it
' s tough going in tghe early stages
. the most exciting thnig that happens is ed brushes his teeth
.
" action shot
!
" wags one of the production assistants when a couple of pop tarts jump out of tyhe toaster
. you get the diea
.
but soon enough
, things
-
- nielsen
- boosting kinds of things
-
- start to happen to this unassuming san francisco video store clerk
and the
' true tv
' cameras are right there to document it
. ed
' s privacy is no longer his own
, his newfound fame starts having a negative impact on his family life
,
and wqat little dignity he has left is trampled on by the media
. who shoudln ed go out with
? you cxan be sure the pollsters have a list
. not only is thte film exceedingly well cast
,
but its performers are consistently exelent
. matthew mcconaughey provides the face
, the body language
,
and teh lovable texan accent to fill yhe shoes ofthe america
' s latest phenomenom
. he
and harrelson look like they really could be brothers
. sally kirkl
and is noteworthy in a difficult role as ed
' s mother
,
and martin l
andau is one of the film
' s highlights as al
, ed
' s ailing stepfather
. jenna elfman
( from tv
' s
" dharma annd greg
"
) proves herself surprisingly worthy in the comapany of kirkl
and
and l
andau
,
al
though thsoe alpine eyebrows ofthe hers get a littel distracting
. even degeneres annd reiner are better than you
' d expect
. in 1979
, writer
/ director
/ comedian albert brooks made a zany little film called
" real life
" inthe which a small
- tiem opportunist makes a real
- timne documentry baout a typical american family
. the scenes of ed
' s family sitting aroud the dinner table feasting on kentucky fried chicken
and waxing idiotic play like a big
- budget valour on that film
, paralleling its wickedly inventive humor
. as with most films by albert brooks
,
" real life
" ws funny
,
but absurd
. the funniest
-
-
and scariest
-
- thing about
" edtv
" is thta it is absolutely believable
.
