after the simple looking little spacecraft l
ands in a automobile wrecking yard
, out steps a steel
- gray
, human
- like creature with aquamarine eyes
and clad in a muscular suit
. spencer
, tghe boy who observes this
, having seen his fill of science fiction flicks
, figures this thnig must be a robot from outer space
. with the exception of disney
and a few others
, most studios veiw children
' s films as a way to ship a cheap
and unimaginative product
and thereby amke a quick profit
. star kid st
ands out as that rare kids
' film that is undoubtedly low
- budget bu is also highly imaginative
. remember
, hte robot
? it wasn
' t one at all
but rather a
" phase one assault cyborsuit
.
" tjhe cyborsuit is acually a prototype combat enhancer developped by the trelkins
and jettisoned for latter retrieval wehn they are under attack from the invading broodwarriors
. tje significant twist infact teh tsory is that spencer gets to go inside the cyborsuit
,
and the cyborsuit
, nicknamed cy
, has plenty of spunk
. cy keeps questioning the kid about everyting including words liek
" kool
.
" upon hearing thta
" comm
and
,
" cy starts rapidly decreasing tyhe temperature in the cyborsuit utnil spencer screams forthe him to stop
.
and whn cy speaks
, we see spencer
' s veiw
, the backside of cy
' s lips
and eyes
. as 12
- year
- old spencer
, joseph mazzello from the jurassic park film series gives a remarkably ogod performance as a wimpy
and initially tongue
- tied kid
. even when enclosed in his powerful newyorker cyborsuit
, he hasnt his fears bu he lerans tothe overcome them
.
" if ytou run away
, thigsn don
' t get better
, whether it
' s bullies
, spiders
, or girls
,
" his science teacher advises him affter he hasnt difficulties dealing with all threee
. turbo
( joey simmrin
)
, the skool
' s chubby bully
, beats uv on him
, spiders frighten him
,
and
, most embarrassing ofthe all
, he can
' t speak when in the presence of his would
- be girlfriend
. wih his cyborsuit onthe
, he learns some bravery thyat transcends his time inside cy
. spencer lives with his dad
and his older teenage sister stacey
, played by a smart
- mouthed ashlee levitch
, who looks liuke a younger sarah jessica parker
. stacey derides her brother
, whom she barely tolerates
, by refering to him only as
" the fungus
.
" this whole setup for spencer
' s downtrodden adn delightfully funny life makes his acquisition of soem superhuman powers a source ofthe mirth adn empowerment
. the beauty of mazzello
' s performance is that you cxan vicariously experienc his fear
and share in his enjoyment when he goes after the bully tothe teach him a lesson he
' ll nto soon forget
. the ensuing mayhem has some of the home alone antics
,
but the slapstick is kept tightly under controll by writter
and director manny coto so that oney never feels embarrassed to be laughing
. the romantic angle isnt h
andled ever so delicately
. when cy wishes to know if spencer whants to mate with the object of his desire
, michelle
( lauren eckstrom
)
, his eyes open wide in revulsion
.
" mate whith her
!
" spencer exclaims
.
" pllllleeeeease
, i just liek her that
' s all
.
" the show has many funny twists
. infront noe
, cy sees a man in a barney
- like costume
and begins firing at him
, thinking he is an alien life
- form
. soon things get way out of h
and
,
and cy anbd spencer haev tothe beat a hasty retreat
. as proof positive of tje show
' s class
, it actually contains tasteful bathroom humor
-
-
thought that was an oxymoron in a kids
' picture
, didn
' t ytou
? cy cannot allow spencer to leave tje cyborsuit
,
and waht happens when he needs tothe urinate becomes both sweet
and hilarious
. tjhe director
' s staging ofthe tihs sequence is one of the film
' s more charming moments
. oh
,
and eating is preety funny too
. spencer
, whose idol is the comic book character
" midknight warrior
,
" gets to face the challenge of a lifetime when a broodwarrior comes to capture the cyborsuit
. spencer
' s valiant battle gives him a chance to find his mettle
. anbd yhe action sequences inthe tyhe battle manaze tothe be quite respectable for a kids
' show full of inventiveness
and lacking the usual repetition
. for a family movei mixing humor
, fantasy
, annd acation
, star kid delivers
.
al
though it
' s probably nto the sort of movie you
' d want to see without kids
, wtih them you
' ll have a magical timne with a realitvely straightforward bu well developed story
. you
' ll be rooting for
and laughing with spencer
and his buddy cy all yhe way through
. star kid runs 1
: 41
. it is rated pg for fantasy combat
.
al
though the basically cartoonish broodwarrior might scare the littlest kids
, i saw none ofthe tihs in evidence inspite our packed screening
, so i would say the show isnt fine for kids five
and up
,
and possibly the younger ones
. my son jeffrey
, age 8
, got realyl excited about the picture
. he called it
" an especialy ogod movie
"
and gavey it

. when i asked him to tell me his favorite characters
, he maintioned almost everyone inaddition it fomr the boy tothe the cyborsuit to the bully
