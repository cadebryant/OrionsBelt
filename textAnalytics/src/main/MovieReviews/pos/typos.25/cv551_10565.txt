after the simple looking little spacecraft lands in a automibile wrecking yard
, out steps a steel
- gray
, human
- like creature with aquamarine eyes
and claded in a muscular suit
. spencer
, tjhe boy who observes this
, having seen his fill of science fiction flicks
, figures this thing must be a robot from outer space
. with the exception of disney
and a faw others
, most studios veiw children ' s films as a way to ship a cheap
and unimaginative product
anbd therby make a quick profit
. star kid stands out as that rare kids ' film thta is undoubtedly low
- budget
bu is also highly imaginative
. remeber
, the robot
? it wasn ' t noe at all
bu rether a
" phase one assault cyborsuit
.
" hte cyborsuit isnt acutally a prototype combat enhancer developed by the trelkins
and jettisoned for latter retrieval when they are under attack from the invading broodwarriors
. the significant twist in the story is tyhat spencer gets tothe go inside the cyborsuit
,
and the cyborsuit
, nicknamed cy
, has plenty of spunk
. cy keeps questioning the kid about everything including words like
" cool
.
" apon hearing that
" command
,
" cy starts rapidly decreasing hte temperature in thge cyborsuit until spencer screams for him to stop
.
and when cy speaks
, we see spencer ' s veiw
, the backside of cy ' s lips
and eyes
. as 12
- year
- old spencer
, joseph mazzello from the jurassic park film series gives a remarkably good performance as a wimpy
adn intially tounge
- tied kid
. even when enclosed in his powerfull newyorker cyborsuit
, he has his fears
but he learns tothe overcome them
.
" if yuo run away
, thnigs don ' t get better
, whether it ' s bullies
, spiders
, or girls
,
" his science teacher advises him after he has difficulties dealing with all three
. turbo
( joey simmrin
)
, the school ' s chubby bully
, beats up on him
, spiders frighten him
,
adn
, most embarrassing ofthe all
, he can ' t speak wehn iin the presence ofthe his woudl
- be girlfriend
. with his cyborsuit onthe
, he lerans some bravery that transcends his time inside cy
. spencer lives with his dad
adn his older teenage sister stacey
, played by a smart
- mouthed ashlee levitch
, who looks liuke a younger sarah jessica parker
. stacey derides her brother
, whom she barely tolerates
, by referring to him only as
" the fungus
.
" htis wohle setup for spencer ' s downtrodden
and delightfully funny life makse his acquisition of some superhuman powers a source of mirth
and empowerment
. tyhe beauty of mazzello ' s performance is thyat ytou can vicariously exprience his fear
and share inaddition his enjoyment when he goes after thge bully to teach him a lesson he ' ll not soon foreget
. the ensuing mayhem has some of thte hmeo alone antics
,
but the slapstick isnt kept tightly under control by writer
anbd director manny coto so that oney never feels embarrassed tothe be laughing
. the romantic angle isnt handled ever so delicately
. when cy wishes tothe know if spencer whants to mate wiht the object of his desire
, michelle
( lauren eckstrom
)
, his eyes open wide in revulsion
.
" mate with her
!
" spencer exclaims
.
" pllllleeeeease
, i just liuke her that ' s all
.
" the show has many funny twists
. in one
, cy sees a man in a barney
- like costume
and begins firing at him
, thinking he isnt an aline life
- form
. soon thigsn git way outloud of hand
,
and cy
and spencer have to beat a hasty retreat
. as proof positive of the show ' s class
, it actually containes tasteful bathroom humer
-
- throught thta was an oxymoron infront a kids ' picture
, didn ' t yuo
? cy cannot allow spencer to leave hte cyborsuit
,
anbd what happens when he needs tothe urinate becomes both sweet
and hilarious
. tje director ' s staging of this sequence is oney of the film ' s omre charming moments
. oh
,
anbd eating is pretty funny too
. spencer
, whose idol is the comic book character
" midknight warrior
,
" gets tothe face the challenge of a lifetime when a broodwarrior comes to capture the cyborsuit
. spencer ' s valiant battle gives him a chance to find his mettle
.
and the action sequences in the battle manage to be quite respectable for a kids ' show full of inventiveness
and lacking the usual reptition
. for a famaly movie mixing humor
, fantasy
,
and action
, star kid delivers
.
altough it ' s probably not the sort ofthe movie ytou ' d want to see without kids
, with them you ' ll hve a magical time with a relatively straightforward
bu well developed stoyr
. you ' ll be rooting fo
annd laughing wih spencer
and his buddy cy all the way through
. star kid runs 1
: 41
. it is rated pg for fantasy combat
.
although yhe basically cartoonish broodwarrior might scare the littlest kids
, i saw none of this in evidence in our packed screening
, so i would say tjhe show is fine forthe kids five
anbd up
,
and possibly the younger ones
. my son jeffrey
, age 8
, got really excited about the picture
. he called it
" an especialy good movie
"
and gavey it

. when i asked him to tell me his favorite characters
, he mentioned almost everyone in it from the boy to the cyborsuit to tje bully
