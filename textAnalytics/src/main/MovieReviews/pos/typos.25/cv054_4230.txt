up unil about a year ago
, john travolta
' s career consisted ofthe those
" look who
' s talking
" movies
( notice how they never called them look who
' s talented
)
and the 1991 bomb shout
( which was bad anough to make most people scream
)
.
but somwhere along tje line
, travolta got the starring role infront the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction adn his career soared once agina
. weird how someone whose career ws on par withthe tje bee gees back inaddition 1978 woudl experience fame
and fortune once again
, while barry
, robin
and maurice gibb sould dont noone better than a 1993 straight
- to
- yhe
- cutout
- bin album aptly named
" size isn
' t everything
"
(
and of course
, they learned that sales are everyting
)
.
but now travolta
' s back onthe the hollywood scene once again
,
and i think we all nkow why
. four words
: contract with thte devil
.
and htis has nothing to do with newt gingrich
' s
" contract with america
.
" no
, satan is much more humane
. anyway
, yes
, travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld
. how do i know
? i own the doccument in question
. amazing what you can buy at those collector
' s shops fo a few hundered dollars
, isn
' t it
? get shorty continues in tje vein of pulp fiction
, with travolta as crime minion chili palmer
. he goes to collect smoe of the masia
' s money from a b
- grade director
( gene hackman
)
and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game
and inot the movei game
. sure
, a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to mkae it in hollywood
,
but i guess that
' s beside the point
. palmer isnt determined to get hackman
' s next project made
, so he sets out to convince big star martin weir
( danny devito
) to star in tghe movei
, bringing along down
-
and
- out horror actress karen flores
( rene russo
)
, who has already hadnt affairs with hackman annd devito
. it doesn
' t take a las vegas odds
- maker to predict that she
and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well
, after the customary sexual tension
and denial
, which hasnt been used in every comedy from
" who
' s the boss
?
" to speechless
. it works inaddition htis case
, unlike
" who
' s the boss
?
" altho it
' s interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil alsot
. complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackman
' s other films
and want in on tihs one too
, along with travolta
' s mob boss trying to track him down fo defecting
. get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction
, despite tghe obvious similarities
. this movie doesn
' t have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction
but it is definitely one ofthe the most intertaining movies i
' ve seen this year
( yes
, even better tahn halloween vi
)
. git shorty is my kind of movie
, oen that mixes intteligent humor whith action
and violentce
. i
' m definately going to have to check out thte novel it was based on
. are you getting this
, shorty
?
