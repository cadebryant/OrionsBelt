- written
, produced by
: stanley kubrick inspired by
:
" traumnovelle
" by
: arthur schnitzer this is an interesting film
. i must first off state
, that you musn
' t believe any of tje rumors of thte film
. cruise is not a cross dresser
, kidman doesn
' t shoot heroin
,
and there
' s not any scene vetween the two that would suggest that they were aided by a sex therapist
. thge look of the film is to suggest tath it follows the translation ofthe the inspired book from the film was written
. the translation
,
" dream novel
,
" makes you thing that the film should have been titled dream film
. there is a noticable amount of graininess tothe the film
. rether than complain about it as soem may anbd lready have
, see it as a stlye ofthe shooting
. i would gather that kubrick got on another lighting kick shooting thsi
and shooted with as much natural glight as he could
. this
and the film looks like it ws pushed another two stops to add more grain
and brighten it slightly
. as an auteur
and stickler forthe details
, kubrick seemed to be a bit lax on this one
. the film looks great
,
but htere are a good deal ofthe bloopers
/ flubs that occur
. yuo see lots ofthe boom shots
( in reflection
)
and you see thge camera at least twice
. 16 months fo this
? wow
. reflection is hte biggest killer for this film
. their apartment anbd almost everything in the film casts reflections
and the crew can be seen in these
, some quite glaringly
. one mroe topic ofthe heated dicussion
: i saw the
" austin powers
" version
,
and tothe be perfectly frank
, unless you know where the overlays are supposed tothe be
, you
' ll propably nto see them
. two girls st
anding next to earch other look a little suspicious
,
but i can wait forthe yhe unrated verison on video to see it tje way it
' s supposed to be
. spoilers below
: yhe film itself starts with
( cruise
) bill
and
( kidman
) alice getting ready for a little x
- mas soiree
. they go tothe a qtuie elegant party in what seems to be a storagehouse for lighting equipment
, whcih is actually an appartmant owned by pollack

and gets alice extremely angry
. in her hazy state
, she tells of an opportunity she almost acted onthe to cheat onthe bill
, not caring baout the possable aftereffects
. bill gets called away when one of his patients dies
,
and goes to console his daughter
. when his patient
' s engaged daughter mkaes a plea for his love
and affection
, he is striked with images ofthe an affair that never occured between his wife
, alice
and a naval officer
. he sees
" opportunity
" as a betrayal tothe his wief
,
and befoer they can continue
, they are interrupted
. as he strolls home
, he encounters a hooker
. seing another
" oportunity
" arise
, he follows the hooker home
. they toy around
,
but befor the act ensues
, alice calls his cell phone
. he breaks tyhe date with the hooker
,
and heads back out inot the night
. he passes a lounge anbd notices that his old medical school buddy is playing
, so he heads inthe
. wehn he meets the friend
, the freind reveals that for extra scratch
, he plays theese strange parties
, while blindfolded
. bill is intrigued
and wants to go tothe one
. nick reluctantly sets him up with directions
and a password
. what follows this is a short meeting where bill obtains a costume for this party
and meets a young girl
, leelee sobieski
,
and her father
. the young girl has drawn his eye
,
but her young age
,
and the prescence of her father deter this from happening
. he gets to the party
, whitch is to say hte least
, a strange affair
. after partaking in some strange
" religous
" right
, women adn men pair off for thte orgy to end all orgies
. a woman warns bill in disguise
, taht he shoudln leave before he isnt exposed as a fraud at tje party
. he isnt detained after a second warning
, where he is outed forthe not bieng in tjhe gropu

. unable to cary on in his day
, he tries piece the events of tjhe previous night together
. in the proces
, he finds that nick has disappeared
, his life is possably in danger
,
and the woman that warned him has died
. i
' m trying to save a bit of the film here
, it
' s worth sitting through to git to this point
. this isnt only about 100 minutes at this point
. htis is a strange film
, because despite tghe events tyhat occur
, the film has a strong family message behind it
. it will be hard to pidgeonhole this film as a certain kind of a film
. it
' s got sex in it
, it hasnt nudity
, drugs
, anbd many more immoralistic values
.
but they all serve to show why they are bad infact noe
' s life
. i recommend this film highly on many merits
. cruise anbd kidman are rarely toghether for longer thna 5 mintues after teh opening scene
,
and the secrecy that shrouded the film should hopefully be apparent as to why it was kept once you see it for youself
.
