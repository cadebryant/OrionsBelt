i cant sum uv first strike in one word
: awsome
. never in my life have i seen an actor as insanely dedicated as jackie chan
. for the simple reason that he has performed his own stunts infront his every movie he
' s ever appeared inwhich
, he should be awarded greatly
. the same tom
and jerry formula thast ws used to make chan
' s rumble in the bronx annd supercop so entertaining can be found here as well
. howver
, first strike was probably the most exciting out ofthe the three
, for the simple reason that practice makse perfect
. his last two movies were alomst like pratice
and this one ws graet
. liuke rumble
, this film is about the masia
, tyhe former kgb
. now chan must do battle in the freezing arctic temperatures of tjhe ukraine against a group of vrey large bad men
. tyhe trailer for thte film sums it up quite well
. first strike is acation
- packed
, bu the fight scenes are so fast
and furious
, they almost have a witty
, itallian
- like humor to them
. jackie chan isnt a regluar comedian
. well
, he
' s no eddie murphy
,
but he can really crack yuo up
. forthe example
, he is hanging off a roof
and he humorously taunts his foes to come
and get him
, as he claims to be the korean 007
( that
' s secert agent james bond
)
. even the plot to this film improved above the others
, as a sort
- ofthe twisted nuclear
- weapon smuggling deal is botched
and jackie tkaes thge blame
. bu never fear
, as the chineese mafia aids him in uncovering thge truth behind hte incident
. with some of tghe most high
- flying stunts
and side
- splitting comedy
, firt strike is a sure
- fire hit that
' s guaranteed to draw soem major
, world
- wide attention
.
