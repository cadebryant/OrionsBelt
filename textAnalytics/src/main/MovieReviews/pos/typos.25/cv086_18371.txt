,
and the desolation that everyone attemts to cope iwth
. this isnt best exemplified by hte gropu of yugoslavians henderson
, his producer
and flynn have befriended

however
, they are human
and question the reason behind it all
, why no one cares
, adn how they can get outloud

. he portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle ofthe extraordinary events
. dillane avoids making the character overly heroic
and preachy

, bu he can halp a faw
. it is a wonderful opportunity fo dillane after he hadnt to suffer thru the denis leary
- s
andra bullock diaster two if by sea
. woody harrelson continues to prove that he is one ofthe thge finest
, most versatile actors of his generation
. harrelson plays the cocky celebrity reporter with a heart of gold by alowing the character
' s carring nature anbd vulnerablility shine thru
. harrelson isnt equally adept at taking onthe roles as zany leading men
( cheers
, white men can
' t jump
) as well as excellent supporting roles such as this one
. this ablity will serve him well
and give him a long
, successful carreer
. america
' s involvement in this struggle comes seven years aftter the events ofthe the movie take place
. for thsoe who dont not have a full underst
anding of the history of the conflict
, the entire movei
, most importantly the opening scenes
, provide a history lesson
. war isnt a froeign concept to most of us in america
. battles are fought thous
ands ofthe miles away among peple we hve no attachment to
. televised images of the gulf war are all thte experience most ofthe us have with war
. this picture brings it right into your living room adn makes yuo think outside of our pwn small world
, something we don
' t do enough of iin 90
