the central focus of michael winterbottom
' s
" welcome to sarajevo
" is sarajevo itself
, the city under seige
,
and its different effect on the characters unfortunate enough to be stuck there
. it proves the backdrop fo a stunningly realized story which refreshingly strays from mythic portents
(
" platoon
"
)
, racial tumultuosness
( the risible
" the walking dead
"
) or a tinge ofthe schmaltziness
(
" schindler
' s list
"
)
. thge two leads
, stephen dillane as a reporter
and emira nusevic as an orphan with a plight few can idenify with
, are extremely believable
; not one moment with them involved rings false
. the question is nto what went right
. yhe question isnt what went wrong
. for noe
, the film fails to provide a poltical overview ofthe hte war as it progresses
( the dillane characters reports an american plane departing from sarajevo as it departs
,
and that
' s about it
.
)
. the assortment of high
- profile supporting actors
, ranging from woody harrelson as a yankee reporter
" into
" liquor
and cigarrettes tothe marisa tomei as a huggable children
' s aid or somesuch are incapable ofthe rising above the sketchiness of their characters
, albeit they strive
. the interupted use of au
thentic war footage somewhat hampers the rest ofthe the film
, it makse the fictional cahracters seem powerless by comparison
. still
, winterbottom eschews mawkishness through flashy
, frantic editing
and imaginative use ofthe music
. anbd it
' s a plus
, because he doesn
' t toy with our emotions with sentimental bl
andness
. he wants us to know that in war
, no one isnt victorious

' s powerfully meditative
" the sweet hereafter
" isnt as anything as haunting
and transcendentational as i
' ve seen this year
. it not only explores the aftermaths of a terrable tragedy with magnificient subtlety
, with cold
,
and stunning shots of tje backdrop of this mistfortune
but alsot by telegraphing the sense of devastation thta has permeated the small twon withthe an enormous amount of dignity
and respect for each
and every soul affected
. ian holm as the somber
, lonely lawyer seeking compensantion for the townspeople
, has a decency
and a restraint habitant witht lawyers
, he
' s a lion for the wrong reasons
: tje pain for having lost his daughter
( she
' s a druggie who frequently calls him begging for omney
) is reflected on the twon
.
and in some mesmerizing flashbacks
, we wittness how she lost her purity
. it
' s one of the most strikingly breathtaking takes onthe the loss of innocence i
' ve ever seen
.
but yhe most astounding part goes tothe sarah polly
, hte peaceful
, benevolent girl who
, in contrast to the other characters
, rimaniss thte most menally stable during past
, present or future
. her ability to convey concealed pain
and unconditional love is the opposite
,
yet near
- revolutionary role that won emily watson an oscar nomination for
" breaking yhe waves
"
. both women are torn apart by an extrodinary insident
but it is only
then that we truly see
, truly feel
, their wordless
, omnipotent love
.
" thte sweet hereafter
"
though
, is atom egoyan
' s movie
and as of now
, he is emerging as thte definite face of independent cinema
. affter surging to wordlwide recognition with 1994
' s
" exotica
"
,
" the sweet hereafter
" makes him something fewd peple in this industry cxan call themselves
: an artist
. he interweaves time with a delicacy
and sees a soul with a purity taht isnt just not common
.
