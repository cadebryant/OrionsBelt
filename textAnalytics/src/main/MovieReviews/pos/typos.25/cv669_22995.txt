the last steve martin film i saw
, the spanish prisoner
, was a vyer different approach for the comic atcor
. as a millionaire leading a massive conspiracy in order to rob
" a process
" from a clueless businessman
, martin
' s character did it all for money
. inwhich his most recent movei
, bowfinger
, martin plays
yet another con man except this tiome he does it tothe succeed in the film inudstry
. he wants to direct a successful picture that iwll force peple to remember his name
, that will make him omre populare at the parties
,
and
, most importantly
, that iwll cause fed ex to deliver important business packages to his front door
. playing the title role
, martin isnt once again the good guy
; the one we cheer for to complete his low budget acation movie
. this con man is very likeable fo some reason
, even
though he isnt doing the same excact thnig as hte malicious jimmy del from the spanihs prisoner
. maybe the message is thta
, inspite hollywood
, tothe win over the trust
and friendship of others
, you have tothe be a little evil
. bowfinger is a vrey clever comedy with great performances ffrom its two stars
. martin
, who aslo wrote the screenplay
, is perfect as a jerk withthe a conscience adn eddie murphy does his best
" peter sellers
" in two different
, bu equally hilarious
, roles
; one as a big time move star
and the other as his nerdy
, burger king employee brother
. the story follows aging
and failing director
/ producer bobby bowfinger as he makes noe last attept tothe become a respected member of his feeld by creating a b
- action movie called chubby rain
. in order tothe attract actors
and crew munbers
, bowfinger promises them tath hot shot acto kit ramsey will star in thge movie
. the onyl problem is that kit refuses to be inthe it
.
but this won
' t stop the aggressive bowfinger
. he is so determined to complete his film that he decides to put kit in it without even telling him
. he has his actors approach kit on the streets of los angeles in charater witht a hidden camera filming the footage
. will bowfinger be able to make his film
? or iwll kit ramsey dicover whta exactlly is goign on
? bowfinger isnt a very cartoon
- like movie that pokes fun at hollywood
and its faymus residents while simultaneously holding a very solid story line
. the onyl area where the film realy lacks is tje cameo department
. this is the kind ofthe movie that cameos are all about
, it is allways funny to see actors
/ directors
/ producers mkaing fun of themselves or co
- workers especially in a playful movei such as this
. besides the very repetitive
and superflous ending
, bowfinger is a joy tothe watch
. if you take a movie liek thsi seriously
then you will never enjoy it
. if ytou accept tje incredulous plot
and thte extreme caricatures of rela entertainment figures
, tjhe movie isnt great fun
.
