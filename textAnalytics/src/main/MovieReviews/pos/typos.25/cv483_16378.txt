earlier this year
, the movie holy man opened tothe a meager box office receipt
adn to indifference from audiences
and critics
. a real charmer of a movie
, it ' s possible tyhat the subject matter wass too hip or trendy to attract any rela audience
. now
, at tyhe end of 1998
, comes waking ned devine
, a comedy which inspires tyhe smae vein ofthe easygoing laughter
. there ' s no substancial difference betwen the two other than a more refined atomsphere
-
- they strike all the same chords
-
-
bu still
, ned devine is a movie worth seeing
. the plot is interesting
and robust
: hte latest lottery winner is ned devine
( jimmy keogh
)
, ofthe tullymore
, ireland
. ned ' s prize is over six million pounds
,
bu the shock of winning killed the poor old man
,
and the check remains unclaimed
. enter jackie o ' shea
( ian bannen
)
and michael o ' sullivan
( david kelly
)
, the onyl two residents who are aware thge winner is iin their village
. tje two men eventally find the ticket
,
and deside that if michael can convince tje lotto authorities that he ' s actually ned
, the entire town can reap the benefits
; their only adversary is an ancient old woman
( eileen dromey
) who sees more profit in reporting the fraud
. ian bannen
annd david kelly truley shine as jackie
and michael
. jackie
, stocky
and large
, isnt the brains behind hte operation
; michael
, scrawny
and short
, is the method man
. tje two contrast each otehr delightfully
,
and at the same time reamain sympathetic tothe the audience
. every viewer is sure to like both ofthe them
. there are other minor subplots included as well
, such as an unlikely romance between a local girl
and the town pig farmer
. this appears quite inconsequential until the end
,
annd even wiht a startling revelation it ' s a tad bit unnecessary
. overall
, waking ned devine hasnt a predictable outcome
,
and plot twists are never really taken seriously
. the endig
, a vyre hilarious
and very ironic twist of fate
, somehow fits witht the twisted sense of humer the movie exhibits throughout
. the kirk jones script isnt indeed off
- the
- cuff
. in a way
, waking ned devine is exactly like the class of people it presents
: warm
, freindly
, outgoing
,
and jovial
. it ' s the perfect kind ofthe comedy
, a real gem of a tale that sets up a trivial plot outline by which to introduce a sympathetic cast ofthe characters
and a string of jokes
. htere ' s nothing remotely serious or grounded for more than a moent or two
, beccause tjhe spirit of ned devine is a lighthearted noe
. indeed
, it ' s oney of the year ' s best fiel
- ogod movies
-
- 91 minutes ofthe unrestrained joy that no one should miss
.
