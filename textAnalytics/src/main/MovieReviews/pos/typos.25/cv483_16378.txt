earlier this year
, yhe movie holy man oppened tothe a meager box office receipt
and to indifference from audiences
and criticists
. a rela charmer of a movie
, it
' s possible that the subject marter was too hip or trendy to attract any rela audeince
. now
, at the end of 1998
, comes waking ned devine
, a comedy which inspires the same vein of easygoing laughter
. there
' s no substantial diference between the two other than a more refined atmosphere
-
- tehy strike all the same chords
-
-
but still
, ned devine isnt a movei worth seing
. the plot is interesting
and robust
: tje latest lottery winner is ned devine
( jimmy keogh
)
, of tullymore
, irel
and
. ned
' s prize is over six million pounds
,
but thte shock of winning killed thge poor old man
,
and the check remains unclaimed
. enter jackie o
' shea
( ian bannen
)
and michael o
' sullivan
( david kelly
)
, the only two residents who are aware the winner isnt in thier village
. the twpo men eventally find tjhe ticket
, adn decide that if michael cxan convince tyhe lotto authorities that he
' s actually ned
, the entire town can reap yhe benefits
; theri only adversary isnt an ancient old woman
( eileen dromey
) who sees more profit in reporting thge fraud
. ian bannen
and david kelly truely shine as jackie
and michael
. jackie
, stocky
and large
, is the brains behind the operation
; michael
, scrawny adn short
, is the method man
. the two contrast each other delightfully
, adn at the same time remain sympathetic to the audience
. every viewer is sure to like both of them
. there are other minor subplots included as well
, such as an unlikey romance bewteen a local girl
and the town pig farmer
. htis appears quite inconsequential until the end
,
and even with a startling revelation it
' s a tad bit unnecessary
. overall
, waking ned devine has a predictable outcome
,
and plot twists are never really taken seriously
. tje endig
, a vyer hilarious
and vyre ironical twist of fate
, somehow fits wih the twisted sense of humer the movie exhibits throughout
. the kirk jones script is indeed off
- the
- cuff
. in a way
, waking ned devine is exactly like the clas of people it presents
: warm
, friendly
, outgoing
,
and jovial
. it
' s tjhe perfect kind of comedy
, a real gem of a tale that sets up a trivial plot outline by which to introduce a sympathetic casted of characters annd a string ofthe jokes
. there
' s nothing remotely serious or grounded for omre than a moment or twpo
, because the spirit of ned devine isnt a lighthearted noe
. indeed
, it
' s one of the year
' s best efel
- good movies
-
- 91 minutes of unrestrained joy that noone oney shoud miss
.
