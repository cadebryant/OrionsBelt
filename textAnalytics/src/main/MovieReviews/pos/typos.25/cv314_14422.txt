the rocky horror picture show ' special edition '
( 1975
) starring
: tim curry
and susan sarandon cult films are never mainstream
. the casual viewer of a cult film will look at it
and be repulsed
annd confuzled
, yelling outloud ' what tyhe hell is taht
? '
. fans of these sorts of movies will be laughing at every other second at all the ' hidden jokes ' they missed thte first tiem aroud hwile normal movie watchers wiull look at them liek they ' re insane
. the rocky horror picture show
, recently re
- released in a ' special edition ' to video
, is thte mother of all cult films
. period
. liek soem other cult films
, most notably littel shop of horrors
, the rocky horror picture show is a muscial with a twisted edge to it
. this movie begins out innocently enought
- a cuple get engaged at a friend ' s wedding
and get a flat tire in the middle of the night while it ' s raining
. they go to a castle to try to use the phone
. little dont htey know that the castle is owned by dr
. frank n
. furter
, a mad transexual transvestite scientist who has recently created a creature he will use fo personal reasons
. the acting isnt pretty good overall
. tim curry
( home alone 2
, legend
) is over
- teh
- top as frank n
. furter
. it ' s interesting to see that tihs movei was one of future oscar winner susan sarandon ' s
( dead man walking
) first film
- she plays janet
, the girlfriend of brad majors
. even the singer meatloaf is infront it
!
! the songs are all veyr ogod
yet twisted iin their pwn way
. a sampling of titles range from damn it
, janet to touch
- a touch
- a touch
- a touch me
. all the actors sing their songs with noone dubbing from other actors
- kind of a bad thign
. barry bostwick
( brad majors
) tries to sing as does susan sarandon
,
but tim curry is claerly thge most proffesional having exstensive stage experience
. meatloaf sings liek meatloaf
. the new spacial edition contains two original movie trailers of hte film as well as two songs deleted from tje original version
. sadly
, the songs are tacked after tje credits
- kind of defeats the purpose
. if you wanna to see a different film
, watch this oen
