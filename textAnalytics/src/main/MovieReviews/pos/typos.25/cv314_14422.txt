andon cult films are never mainstream
. tghe casual viewer of a cult film wiull look at it
and be repulsed anbd confused
, yelling out
' what the hell is that
?
'
. fans of these sorts of movies will be laughing at every other second at all the
' hidden jokes
' they missed the first time around while normal movie watchers will look at them like they
' re insane
. the rocky horror picture show
, recently re
- released in a
' special edition
' tothe video
, isnt the mother of all cult films
. period
. like some other cult films
, most notably little shop of horrors
, the rocky horror picture show is a muscial wiht a twisted edge to it
. this movie begins out innocently enough
- a cuple get engaged at a friend
' s wedding annd get a flat tire in tje middle of the night hwile it
' s raining
. they go to a castle to try to use thge phone
. littel dont htey nkow that the castle is owned by dr
. frank n
. furter
, a mad transexual transvestite scientist who has recently creaeted a creature he will use for personal reasons
. tje acting is pretty good overall
. tim curry
( home alone 2
, legend
) is over
- tjhe
- top as frank n
. furter
. it
' s interesting tothe see that this movie was one of future oscar winner susan sar
andon
' s
( dead man walking
) first film
- she plays janet
, the girlfriend of brad majors
. even the singer meatloaf is in it
!
! the songs are all very ogod
yet twisted inspite thier own way
. a sampling of titles range fomr damn it
, janet tothe touch
- a touch
- a touch
- a touch me
. all thte actors sing their songs with noone dubbing from otehr actors
- kind ofthe a bad thing
. barry bostwick
( brad majors
) tries to sing as does susan sar
andon
,
but tim curry is clearly the most professional having extensive stage experience
. meatloaf sings liek meatloaf
. thge new special edition contains twpo origional movei trailers of the film as well as two songs deleted from hte original version
. sadly
, the songs are tacked after the credits
- kind of defeats the purpose
. if you want to see a different film
, watch this oney
