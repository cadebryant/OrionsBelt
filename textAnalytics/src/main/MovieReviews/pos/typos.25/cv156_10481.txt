wih storytelling thsi compelling
, who needs books
? based on tje book by author james ellroy
, l
. a
. confidencial isnt probably one of the best peice of work produced by hollywood in recent years
. together wiht director curtis hanson
( the hand that rocks the cradle
, the river wild
) whom ellroy corroborated closley throughout the shooting of tjhe film
, resulted in a movei with a plot
and and scirpt so tight
, an atom would have to squeeze itself through
. set in tje 50s
, the story revolves around 3 policemen of vivid personalities
. jack vincennes
( spacey
) is thge cop who is more conserned onthe busting with fame
and stardom ala hollywood stlye
, concentrating heavily on wokr wich will attract him media attention
. there is also teh young hot
- shot rookie
, ed exley
( pearce
)
, fresh out of the accadamy
and all
- outloud to carve a name fo himself in the footsteps of his legendary cop father
. yhe tough
and unnerving bud white
( crowe
)
, a cop who believes inthe justice
, the swift
and violent way
. 3 policemen
, distinct inaddition theri characters
and paths
bu all ofthe them wokring infront a place where there is noone real distinction between good
and evil
. when his partner is murdered on the day of his resignation
, bud sets out to fidn the people responsible
but unwittingly delved himself inot something more tahn just a simple robbery murder
. even after exley receives a promotion for his owrk on the murder case
, happenings began to link itself to the muder
. the 3 evenhtually reach a point of convergance whn whta actaully began as a peronal investigation turns outloud to be an uncovering ofthe a complex web of organised
- crime inaddition hollywood
. the last time i remember a film so clever
anbd compelling was when i watched tyhe usual suspects
. in l
. a
. confidential
, you do not get the shock
and cleverness as the fromer
bu it has a lot more of
` stopry ' oging for it
. there is not a single moent in teh film in which i feeled wass slow at all
. surprisingly
,
though spacey doed a vyer convincing job as the street
- wise vincennes
, the movie was carried mostly by tje two rather
` unknowns '
, pearce
and crowe
. pearce ' s exley is cool
and calculative in his actions
annd there isnt a slight hint of val kilmer in his apprearance
. crowe ' s bud white isnt the most impressive of all
; head
- strong
and tempermental
, he should obtain some sort ofthe recognition fo his owrk here
. superb acting
.
, wonderful storytelling
and one of the best climaxing gunfights ever
. easily tjhe best hollywood piece for 1997
