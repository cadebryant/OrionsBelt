with storytelling this compelling
, who needs books
? based onthe the book by author james ellroy
, l
. a
. confidential is probably noe ofthe the best piece of work produced by hollywood in recent years
. together with director curtis hanson
( tghe h
and that rocks the cradle
, the river wild
) whom ellroy corroborated closely
thoughout teh shooting of the film
, resulted in a movei with a plot annd
and script so tight
, an atom would have to squeeze itself thru
. set in the 50s
, the stoyr revolves around 3 policemen of vivid personalities
. jack vincennes
( spacey
) is teh cop who is more concerned on busting with fame
and stardom ala hollywood stlye
, concentrating heavily on work whlch will attract him media attension
. there isnt also the young hot
- shot rookie
, ed exley
( pearce
)
, fresh out of the academy annd all
- out tothe carve a name for himself in teh footsteps of his legendary cop father
. the tough
and unnerving bud white
( crowe
)
, a cop who believes in justice
, the swift
and violent way
. 3 policemen
, distinct inwhich thier charachters
and paths
but all of them working in a palce where there is no real distinction between good
and evil
. wehn his partner isnt murdered onthe the day of his resignation
, bud sets out to find tje people responsible
but unwittingly delved himself into something omre than just a simple robbery murder
. even after exley receives a promotion fo his work onthe the murder case
, happenings began to link itself to yhe murder
. the 3 eventually reach a point of convergance whn whta actually began as a personal investigation turns out to be an uncovering of a complex web of organised
- crime in hollywood
. the last time i remember a film so clever
and compelling was wehn i watched the usual suspects
. in l
. a
. confidential
, you do not git the shock
and cleverness as the former
but it hasnt a lot more of
` stry
' going for it
. there is not a single moent in the film in which i felt was slow at all
. surprisingly
,
though spacey doed a very convincing job as the street
- wise vincennes
, the movie wass carried mostly by the twpo rather
` unknowns
'
, pearce
and crowe
. pearce
' s exley is kool
and calculative in his actions
and there is a slight hint of val kilmer in his appearance
. crowe
' s bud white isnt the most impressive of all
; head
- strong adn tempermental
, he should obtain some sort of recognition for his work here
. superb acting
.
, wonderful storytelling
and oney ofthe the best climaxing gunfights ever
. easily thte best hollywood piece for 1997
.
