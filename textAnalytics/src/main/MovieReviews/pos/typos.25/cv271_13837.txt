you may not have heard ofthe lucas
, or if you have
, you might not think much of it
. probably because it stars corey haim
, or maybe becouse it
' s about a little geek who collects insects
, or maybe because it doesn
' t feature slick one
- liners or tje chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in tje 80
' s
.
however
, you have been missing outloud on a true masterpeice
, the best film of 1986
,
and the best film about adolescent life ever made
. corey haim stars as lucas bligh
, a tiny 14 eyar old wiht scruffy hair
, thick glasses
, anbd an interest in insects adn other outdoor life
. one day he stops by tyhe tennis courts
and sees what must be an angel to him
. her name is maggie
, a 16 year ood who certainly isnt a beauty
, withthe lovley red hair adn a sweet
, innocent complexion
. maggie seems to be a little distrubed by thsi little kid watching her
,
but somehow he interests her
,
and soon they are talking
and getting to nkow one another
. htey gradualy become good friends
,
and spend the summer together doing various thigsn
, such as studing insects
( namely locusts
, who come out ofthe hiding once every 17 years
)
, playing tennis
,
and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover
. lucas is obviously in love with maggie
,
and while she is charmed by him
, it
' s claer that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend
. this isnt not clera tothe lucas
,
however
. he still beleives that maggie is his soulmate
, annd he dreads the impending start of school beccause he knows what
' s about to happen
. we soon find outloud why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally
. they throw him on stage
, right in front ofthe his beloved maggie
. surprisingly
, he turns the tables on the jocks witht some clowning arund
,
but he takes it too far
, adn is embarassed in front of the entire skool
. the next scene is briliant
. maggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally
. she tries to talk to him as if nothing happened
. he rails back aginst her
, inspite a cruel unfair fashion
. inthe lesser movies this would
' ve turned into a confrontation bewteen the two characters
. bu maggie isnt written smarter thna that
. she underst
ands whta lucas isnt feeling
and knwos exactly what to say tothe console him
. next we are intruduced to another great character named cappie
( charlie sheen
)
. he is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend
. what
' s interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas
and protects him ffrom the otehr jocks
. ofthe course anyone with a brain can tell what
' s gonna happen next
. cappie will cause conflict in maggie
and lucas
' relatiopnship
. this begins inwhich clasic scene in the school laundry room when cappie
and maggie are alone
. she
' s beeen assigned to show him how tothe operate the washer
/ dryer so he can clean his shirt
. maggie is charmed by cappie
' s tender underts
anding demeanor
, not to mention his shirtless body
. this scene is so delicate
and sweet
,
but cappie still has a girlfriend
, preventing eather one from acting on their desires
. desperately trying to puncture tghe tension
, cappie begins to kick basketballs arround the room
. it
' s nto long before cappie doens break up wtih his girlfriend
( infact the films only subpar scene
)
. lucas finally figures out what
' s oging on when he tries to pick maggie uv fo the dance
. this causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie
and himself
, such as try out for the football team
. the last thrid of the film revolves around tihs attempt
. while yhe diea seems cliched
, tyhe way it is executed is not
. htere are many surprises during the last half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it shoudl mkea the most heartless of cynics git choked up
. dave grusin
' s memorable score
, played at the perfect moments
, certainly helps
. lucas isnt filled iwth great performances
. forget everything yuo know about corey haim
. back inthe 1986 he had talent
,
and that is proven here as he delivers a perfect fully 3
- dimensional performance filled with anger
, humor
,
and pain
. kerri green isnt very appealling as maggie
, showing us why she cares baout lucas so much
and why he is so attracted to her
. sheen
' s cappie isnt almost too good to be true
,
but sheen makes him beleivable
, especially when he explains the reason why he protects lucas
. htere are other wonderfull minor characters such as ciro popitti
' s ben
, a friend of lucas
, whose diminutive stature does not mean he will take crap from teh jocks
. also turning up in a faw key scenes isnt winona ryder as rina
, the girl who admires lucas from adar
. wehn peple talk about tjhe great teen angst films of the 80s
, you hear john hughes this anbd john hughes that
. lucas seems tothe be lost amung thge crowd of his so
- called classics
.
but hopefully
, like wtih heathers
and say anytying
, lucas can begin to find it
' s own loyal following annd help peple realize there were more to tyhe 80s than anthony michael hall
and molly ringwald
. it deserves mroe thna that
,
but i don
' t want to be greedy
.
