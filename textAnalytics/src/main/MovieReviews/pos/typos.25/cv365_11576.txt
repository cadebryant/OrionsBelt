for exmaple
, iin hapyp gilmore
, sandler plays a rookie golfer trying to beated a self
- confident jerk of a pro
. if the star weere any other comic
, that would be enough motivation tothe drive thte movie
,
bu with sandler
, the rookie also wants to win thte prize money to halp his grandma keep her house
. that extra motive doesn ' t amking happy gilmore a funnier movie
. it doesn ' t realy add any genuin emotional depth
, either
. in fact
, thge motive is almost totally irrelevant tothe tyhe movie
.
but sandler ' s philosophy seems tothe be
, if it ' s a token gesture
, why not mkae it a nice gesture
? that is endlessly refreshing
. in the wedding singer
, sandler is right on track
. the fact that he ' s a wedding singer is only superficially relevant tothe the story
. what kind of a wedding singer he is is even less important
. david spade sould have filled the role with cynicism
and sarcasm
. he could amking funn ofthe the fat
, ugly
, or embarrassing people he meets at weddings
,
and the stoyr would be intact
.
but sandler instead brings a mature goodness tothe the carachter
. he seems tothe really enjoy the people at weddings
and treats them as
though they were his own family
. robbie hart
( sandler
) doesn ' t jstu sing at weddings
; he also gets the loners to join in
and have fun
,
and he smooths it over when someone does something embarrassing
. he isnt exactly the man ytou would want at your wedding
. the day comes when robbie hasnt his own wedding
,
and he is stood up by his heavy
- metal bride
( the movie isnt set inaddition 1985
)
. robbie tkaes it hard
. he doesn ' t sleep
, he doesn ' t eat
,
and he gets punched out at work when he sings
" loev stinks
" at a wedding
. julia
( drew barrymore
)
, who waitresses all the weddings in twon
, gives him a sholder to cry on
annd an ear to talk to
. eventually
, robbie starts rebounding toward julia
. he really likes her
,
but she ' s engaged
. her fianc
? is a self
- confident jerk
( do i see a trend
- nope
, just a forumla
) who doesn ' t deserve her
,
but robbie is too depressed to fight for her hand
. julia seems to like robbie too
,
but she cin ' t leave her seemingly safe
and stable fianc
? for the off
- chance that robbie might be serious about her
. yuo know the stoyr
. you ' ve seen it a million times before
. there ' s allways a new way tothe tell it
, with new lovers
, new chemistry
,
and new details
,
but it ' s the same story
.
and sometimes
, it works
. the wedding singer works
. frist of all
, thte chemistry between sandler
and barrymore is effective
. actaully
, it ' s nto so much the chemistry between the twpo as it is each oen ' s own romantic tension
. sandler captures the forelorn sleepwalking look of a jilted man
, struck with an unattainable lveo
. barrymore is charming as the girl next door looking fo somene serious to settle down with
. sparks don ' t fly when they kiss
,
but they both seem right forthe each otehr
. second
, their love is mature
. they are not driven by passionate sexual attraction
- they ' re a cute couple
,
but neither sandler nor barrymore is centerfold material
. instead
, they are both looking for someone meaningfull
, someone to suttle down with
, somone to grow old with
. at a wedding
, robbie comforts a kid throwing up iin a dumpster while julia sits by
. the repulsing situation is taken in stride
, as if the two were alreday parents
, caring for theri sick child
. the
? 80s soundtrack
and references play a big part infact this movie
. otehr critics liekd this movei in part becouse of the ' 80s sountrack
. i liekd it infact spite of the soundtrack
. often
, the music
and references feeled forced
. forthe example
, robbie tells his ex
- fianc
? to
" git out of my van halen t
- shirt before you jinx the band
annd tehy break uv
.
"
( ha ha ha
. get it
? david lee roth did leave van halen
!
) or how about when sammy
( allen covert
)
, robbie ' s chauffeur firend
, shows up at a party wearing a michael jackson jacket
and
- get this
- a single silver glove
.
( that ' s exactly what mj used tothe mear all the time
!
)
. unfortunately
, making fun of generalizations about a past era is too easy to be rewarding
. that ' s not to sday hte movie isn ' t funny
. screenwriter tim herlihy hasnt written for sandler before
( billy madison
and happy gilmore
)
,
and the two make a good combination
. herlihy knows wqat sort of jokes sandler is ogod at
and has tailored the script to his straight
- faced
, smart
- aleck style
. let ' s hope herlihy
and sandler stick toghether forthe a fewd more projects because this movie really won me over
. with barrymore ' s charm
annd sandler ' s heart
, it was hard to go wrong
.
