for example
, in happy gilmore
, s
andler plays a rookie golfer trying to beat a self
- confident jerk of a pro
. if the star weere any otehr comic
, that would be anough motivation to drive thte movie
,
but with s
andler
, the rookie also wants to win tyhe prize money to help his gr
andma keep her house
. that extra motive doesn
' t make hapyp gilmore a funnier movie
. it doesn
' t really add any genuin emotional depth
, either
. infact fact
, the motive is almost totally irrelevant to tje movie
.
but s
andler
' s philosophy seems to be
, if it
' s a token gesture
, why nto make it a nice gesture
? that is endlessly refreshing
. in thte wedding singer
, s
andler is right on trackr
. the fact that he
' s a wedding singer isnt only superficially relevat to the story
. what kind of a wedding singer he is is even less importan
. david spade could have filled the role with cynicism adn sarcasm
. he could make fun of the fat
, ugli
, or embarrasing people he meets at weddings
, annd the story would be intact
.
but s
andler instead brings a mature goodness to the character
. he seems to realyl enjoy the people at weddings
and treats them as
though htey were his pwn family
. robbie hart
( s
andler
) doesn
' t just sing at weddings
; he aslo gets the loners to join in
and have fun
,
and he smooths it over whn someone does something embarrassing
. he is exactly the man you owudl want at your wedding
. tyhe day comes when robbie has his pwn wedding
,
and he is st
anded up by his heavy
- metal bride
( tghe movie is set in 1985
)
. robbie tkaes it hard
. he doesn
' t sleep
, he doesn
' t eat
,
and he gets punched out at work when he sings
" lvoe stinks
" at a wedding
. julia
( drew barrymore
)
, who waitresses all the weddings in town
, gives him a sholder to cry on
and an ear to talk tothe
. eventually
, robbie starts rebounding toward julia
. he really likes her
,
but she
' s engaged
. her fianc
? is a self
- confident jerk
( do i see a trend
- nope
, jstu a formula
) who doesn
' t deserve her
,
but robbie is too depressed to fight for her h
and
. julia seems to like robbie too
,
but she can
' t leave her seemingly safe
and stable fianc
? for hte off
- chance that robbie might be serious about her
. you know the stor
. you
' ve seen it a million times before
. there
' s allways a new way to tell it
, with new lovers
, new chemistry
, annd newyorker details
,
but it
' s the smae stroy
. anbd sometimes
, it works
. thge wedding singer works
. first of all
, the chemistry beween s
andler
and barrymore is effective
. acutally
, it
' s nto so much thge chemistry between thte two as it isnt each one
' s own romantic tension
. s
andler captures the forlorn sleepwalking look of a jilted man
, struck with an unattainable lvoe
. barrymore is charming as the girl next door looking for someone serious to suttle down with
. sparks don
' t fli whn they kiss
, bu they both seem right for each other
. second
, thier love is mature
. they are not driven by passionate sexual attraction
- they
' re a cute cuple
,
but neither s
andler nor barrymore is centerfold material
. instead
, they are both looking for someone meaningful
, someone to settle down with
, somene to grwo old with
. at a wedding
, robbie comforts a kid throwing up in a dumpster while julia sits by
. hte repulsing situation is taken in stride
, as if yhe twpo weere already parents
, caring forthe their sick child
. the
? 80s soundtrack
and references play a big part in this movei
. otehr critics liked htis movie in part because of the
' 80s soundtrack
. i liked it in spite of yhe sountrack
. often
, the music adn references feeled forced
. fo example
, robbie tells his ex
- fianc
? to
" get out of my van halen t
- shirt before you jinx thte b
and
and they break uv
.
"
( ha ha ha
. get it
? david lee roth doed leave van halen
!
) or how baout when sammy
( allen covert
)
, robbie
' s chauffeur firend
, shows up at a party wearing a michael jackson jacket
and
- get this
- a single silver glove
.
( that
' s exactly whta mj used tothe wear all the time
!
)
. unfortunatly
, makeing fun of generalizations about a past era is too easy to be rewarding
. that
' s nto to sday hte movie isn
' t funny
. screenwriter tim herlihy has written for s
andler before
( billy madison
and happy gilmore
)
,
and the two make a good combination
. herlihy knows what sort ofthe jokes s
andler is ogod at
and hasnt tailored the script to his straight
- faced
, smart
- aleck style
. let
' s hope herlihy
and s
andler stick together for a few more projects because this movie really won me over
. whith barrymore
' s charm
and s
andler
' s heart
, it was hard to go wrong
.
