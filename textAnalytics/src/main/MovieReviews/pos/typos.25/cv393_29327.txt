, tyhe coach even admits to having fatherly feelings towords him
. unfortunatly
, the coach
' s real son
, hugo
, isn
' t too pleased to hear that
. in fact
, he doesn
' t like hearing about any of odin
' s triumphs
, as they generally suersede his own
. so what doens he setted out tothe do
? well
, let
' s just say that he starts to mess with people
' s heads
and one hting leads to another thnig which leads to
.
.
. well
, you
' ll see
. critique
: a very powerful
, thoroughly depressing
, well
- acted
" non
- teen
" movie starring a bunch ofthe teens
. credit director tim blake nelson for creating a modern day version of this shakespearian classic
, set in a realistic high skool environment
, with tyhe basketball championships as the backdrop anbd an impending sence ofthe doom as it core
. you alsot have to give it up to all of the actors in this film
, who turn over smoe very convincing performances
, taking yuo through all of theri characters
' ups
and downs
. hartnett especially should be applauded for taking on such a dispicable character
, a dude who ytou just want to grab by the throat annd beat the shit out ofthe
( sign ofthe a good actor
, if you ask me
)
. phifer also comes tothe play infront this movei
, with a nice blend of charisma
, fear
, love adn anger spread over his character
. i was allways onthe this guy
' s side
and definately feeled sorry for him as things moved along
. julia stiles was also ogod
,
but her character wasn
' t much different from others that she
' s played recently
. i was
however vrey surprised iwth martin sheen
' s showing
, since i hadn
' t taken him too seriously as an acotr over thge past few years
. his chracter is definitely over
- the
- top inaddition tihs film
,
but i appreciated his fervor
, his rige
, his ultimate anbd blind desire tothe win above all
. a great example ofthe a workaholic man who cannot see the trees from the forest
. i doed hvea a faw reservations about the movie
though
. frist ofthe all
, what was with all of the gangsta hip
- hop music used in pretty much every other scene transistion
? it was cute at first
,
but became a little too obvious
and annoying after a few times
. hte film ws also edited pretty choppily
.
.
. like soem scenes were cutted outloud adn no one
" cleaned it up
" afterwards
. i also didn
' t like the fact tyhat hartnett
' s charater
, the man behind much of the nastiness that goes down iin this film
, was infallible
. in other words
, preety much everthing he says or asks ofthe somone
, happens automatically annd without any goofups
. i mean
, i know the guy is smart
and all
,
but i would have appreciated a little more
" realism
" under some of the circumstances
.
but overall
, the movie will devistate yuo
. it
' s not a
" funn date movei
"
. it
' s not a movie about the high school basketball team
and how its black star falls for the white girl from the other side of the tracks
. it
' s about jealousy
, loev
, envy
, fury
, passion
, revenge
and pretty much any otehr negative thougth that
' s ever passed through your head
. is it worth seing
? oh
, most definitely
!
( pun intended
) it
' s a moving picture with grat performances
, no shakespearian speak
( thank yuo
, god
!
) adn an outst
anding directorial job by nelson
. tyhe final scene alone is enough to send a massive chill down your spine
,
and i ws especially empressed wtih tje director
' s choice of music near thte end
. inwhich fatc
, the whole sequence was qtuie reminiscent of the fianl showdown scene from taxi driver
, adn i guess thta
' s saying something right ther
. where
' s joblo comming from
? 10 things i hate baout you
