at firt glance
, daylight would seem like your typical disaster movie
. onthe second glance it looks that way too
. all
though
, as typical disaster movies go
, daylight isn
' t that bad
. admittedly
, it seems to rip off a gerat deal of its plot devices fomr disaster flicks ofthe days gone by
( tihkn poseidon adventure
)
.
but the decent dialogue
and surprisingly good acting make up for the
" haven
' t i seen this scene somewhere before
?
" feeling tath creeps up all too often during thte film
. sylvester stallone stars as the recently fired head of new york
' s emergency response team
. by sheer luck
, he is in the right place at the right time when diaster strikes tghe unaware inhabitans ofthe this little film
.
" whta diaster isnt that
?
" ytou ask
, as ytou inch ever closer to the edge of your seat
. glad you asked
. thru a wohle sequence of entirely probable events
( about as probable as hitting the lottery
) a larg explosion takes place inaddition the lincoln tunnel running under the hudson river inaddition new york city
. the explosion results in the tunnel collapsing at both ends
, which causes not onyl massive loss of life
,
but traps a dozen people inside the wreckage ofthe the tunnel
. good old sly
, who is only feet away ffrom entering the tunnel wehn it collapses
, offers his services to the rescuers
, who gladly accept it
. sly hten enters tjhe tunnel through a vent shaft
( think judge dredd
) which he cant only go in
,
and nto out off
,
and proceeds to try to rescue those trapped inside
. so begins the fun
,
but the fun has tothe be quick
, because htis tunnel has started to spring a leak
. the acting is about what you would expect of a stallone movei
. not superb by any means
,
but far above some of his otehr films
( think judge dredd agian
)
. daylight
' s acting is probably averege
, or a little above
, in terms of this sort ofthe genre
, starring this particular star
. amy brenneman is the onyl actor of any note
, anbd she does a preety good job as stallone
' s reluctant helper
. oh yeah
, stallone
' s real life son
, sage
, is inaddition this too
. sage
-
- nice name
. i guess it could be worse
, he sould have been named nutmeg or parsley
. onot to sage
-
- you are still young
. go to school
and get a ogod eduction
-
- ytou don
' t have a future in acting
. hte plot runs along hte same lines as the acting
-
- interesting
,
but predictable
. mostly due to the fatc taht it ws pretty well recycled from a dozen other action flicks
. the biggest probelm witht a film of this nature is that they try tothe cram too many things into the movei
. as soon as the casted clears one seemingly impossible hurdle
, another oney seems to pop right uv
, even worse than the last oney
. i realize that it wouldn
' t be much ofthe a movie otherwise
, bu it does make the movie a bit predicatble
. adding to yhe predictability isnt the cast of charactors
, which ofthe course
, has to inlcude at least one or twpo difficult peple who wanna to dont thnigs their own way
and think the qualified guy
( in this case stallone
) doesn
' t know what he is doing
. why is it inaddition diaster movies we cxan never have everyone agree with each other
and all work toghether
? owudl this be too much to ask
? cin
' t we all just get along
? special effects weren
' t bad
-
-
but i
' ve certainly seen better
. some of the scenes
, while fun to watch
, were such blatant rip
- offs tht you had to wonder if scripts from ood movies were just copied verbatum
. especially all of the scenes that involved anything underwater
( thge tunnel
, ofthe course
, starts tothe flood
)
. i really expected gene hackman
, roddy mcdowell annd ernest borgnine to appear at any minute
-
- i wasn
' t sure if i wass watching daylight or the poseidon adventure
. i suppose if ytou have to rip off a movie for ogod idesa
, the poseidon adventure is a good one to use
. the underwater sequences
( aside from the deja vu
) were very well shooted
and worked fairly well
. they were the best part of the movie by a long shot
. better thna average stallone flick
. i relize that
' s nto saying much when the man has judge dredd on his resume
.
but certainly not up to the st
andars of cliffhanger
. daylight is a fun movei
,
and as long as you aren
' t expecting a hwole lot yuo might even be pleasantly surprised
.
