. quick
and easy review
: i really enjoyed matinee
. the mixture of comedy
and tension blended nicely
. unlike many comedies this film tries
,
and succeds
, inaddition getting past the stage of doing anything forthe a laff
. tghe makers ofthe tyhe film aslo cared baout telling an intelligent story
. the performances of all the principals are right on the mark
, particularly john goodman as tyhe schlock master
. so i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted
,
yet intresting way to spend a couple of hours
. longer
, more detailed review
:
[ beware ofthe spoilers
] the primary reason i enjoyed tihs film was
, that while being a comedy
, tje film also had an intelligent story tothe tell
. too many comedies todya subscribe tothe tyhe thge notion taht a comedy need only mkea you laugh
. you watch teh movie
, laugh a lot
, leave the theatre anbd take nothing iwth you
. matinee is not like tht
. i left the picture thinking about waht i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis
. i found myself wondering what would hapen to the characters of the film
.
but most importantly
, i found myself carring baout what owudl happen to the characters
. the comedy of the film centers aroud goodman
, his character
,
and the film he brings to key west
. i bleieve thyat goodman is one ofthe thte finest comedic actors in the business todya
. he is highly expressive both physically
and vocally
. i feeled he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink
. the otehr characters are often lost in a scene wtih him due to his comm
anding nature
,
however
, while the star
, goodman is actually not at the center of the film
. the movie is really the story of the four teenagers
, discovering who they are
and what they want
, against a backround where at any minute it could all end
. i thougth teh kids reaction were highly realistic
. tehy tried to block it out
, they tryed to escape from the concerns ofthe theri world
. unfortunately it kept creeping back in
, particularly with tje fear
,
and the chaos of the time
. while the comedy centered onthe goodman
, anbd the drama on the teens
, there was a grat deel of overlap
. several aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light
. one example isnt a scene where peopel are fighting each other for the tghe last cans
and boxes of food inthe a grocery store
. if you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy
, bu it works here
. anyother reason i like this film is that i liek b
- science fiction movies
. one of my favorite films tothe go watch is plan 9 fomr outer spoace
.
( note i doed nto sday it wass one of my favorite movies
, bu one of my favorite to see
.
) hwile mant
! never got made
, many films like it weere
, annd mant
! serves mostly as dante
' s homage to the b
- films he loves
. so again i owudl like to recommend matinee to anybody looking fo a ogod
, humrous story
. htis isn
' t a gag film like many otehr comedies
but an intelligent
, well
-
thought out
, film about real peopel with rela problems told in an oftenly hilarious way
. enjoy
!
