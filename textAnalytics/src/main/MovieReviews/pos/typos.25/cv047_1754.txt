. quick
and eazy review
: i really enjoied matinee
. the mixture of comedy
and tension blended nicely
. unlike many comedies this film trys
,
adn succeeds
, in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh
. the makers of tjhe film alsot cared about telling an intelligent story
. the performances of all the principals are right onthe the mark
, particularly john goodman as the schlock master
. so i would definately recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted
,
yet intresting way to spend a couple of hours
. longer
, more detailed review
:
[ beware ofthe spoilers
] the primary reason i enjoyed htis film wass
, that hwile being a comedy
, tjhe film also had an intelligent story tothe tell
. too many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh
. you watch the movie
, laff a lot
, leave tyhe theatre
and take nothing with you
. matinee isnt not like tyhat
. i left hte picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis
. i found myself wondering what would happen tothe the characters ofthe the film
.
but most importantly
, i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters
. the comedy of the film centers around goodman
, his character
,
adn tyhe film he brings to key west
. i blieve that goodman isnt one of tjhe finest commedic actors in thge business today
. he isnt highly expressive both physically
and vocally
. i felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink
. teh other characters are often lost in a scene whith him due to his commanding nature
,
however
, while the star
, goodman isnt actually not at the center ofthe tyhe film
. the movie is really the tsory of thte four teenagers
, discovering who tehy are
and what tehy wanna
, aganist a background where at any minute it sould all end
. i thought the kids reaction were highly realistic
. they tried tothe block it out
, htey tried to escape from the concerns ofthe their world
. unfortunately it kept creeping bakc in
, particularly with tyhe fear
,
and tjhe chaos of tjhe tiem
. while teh comedy centered on goodman
,
and the drama on the teens
, there wass a great deal of overlap
. several aspestus of the panic are shown infact a humoous light
. one exmaple is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans
annd boxes of fod in a grocery stroe
. if you think about it the threath of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy
,
but it works here
. another reason i liek this film isnt tyhat i liek b
- science fiction movies
. noe of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 fomr outer space
.
( note i did not say it was one ofthe my favorite movies
,
but one of my favorite to see
.
) while mant
! never got made
, many films like it were
,
and mant
! serves mostly as dante ' s homage tothe the b
- films he loves
. so again i would like to recomend matinee to anybody looking for a good
, humoous story
. this isn ' t a gag film like many other comedies
bu an intelligent
, well
- thought out
, film about real people wih real problems told in an often hilarious way
. enjoy
!
