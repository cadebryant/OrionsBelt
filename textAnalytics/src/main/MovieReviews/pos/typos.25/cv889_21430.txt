so here is the second of 1999
' s remakes of clasic horror movies
. the first was the dumb
, pathetic
but ok remake of the classic
' the haunting
'
. now comes the highly awaited remake ofthe hous on haunted hill
. tghe clasic which starred vincent price as a man who pays a group of people 100
, 000 to stay in his hous
. if they survive the night htey get the money
. if not well you get the jurisdiction
. having not
yet seen the film
( dvd on its way
) i wasn
' t sure if i would really like the remake
.
but sure enough it comes through
and has a gerat storyline to fall back on
. geoffrey rush
( in a fantastic role with an incredible performance
) is steven price
, tyhe owner of an amusement park destined tothe scare the wits out ofthe people
. his wife evelyn price is throwing a party with her friends
. steven dismays at tghe idea
and makes his own list
. somehow someone
, or something changes that list
and five other people are invited to the party
. eddie
( taye diggs
) an ex
- baseball player
, sarah
( ali carter
) an ex
- assistant who can re
- wire anytying
, melissa
( brigette wilson
) a talk
- show host in sorts
, dr
. blackburn
( peter ghallager
)
,
and watson
( chris kattan
) a smart
- mouthed humorist iin ways
. what he is gonna do is pay these five people 1
, 000
, 000 dollars if htey can survive through the niht
. if they can tehy get the money
, if not well they don
' t
. the house on haunted hill used tothe be an insane asylum
. years befoer mental patients borke outloud
and killed the dr
. there
, forcing him tothe lock the place uv because if he died
, so did they
. everyone who was in there burned to death
. nowe it is steven price
' s home
and he is throwing thsi party fo these five people
. what starts outloud as a seamingly normal night
, turns into a horrifying
, blood splattering night
. tjhe deep dark secrets of waht really hapened in that asylum annd why thsoe guests are actually there are revealed
. oney
- by
- oney tghe people start to dissapear
. conspiracies start to turn uv
, annd steven price finds out that his hous may be alive after all
. thge people find rooms
, which once held mental patients
. rooms which once had people dying
. rooms which may still contain theese people
. now these five people must try annd survive the ngiht
and try
and survive the house
,
and they must survive each otehr with terrorfying results
. since i officially haven
' t seen the original i can
' t say which is better
. i can say
however i liked tihs movie
. geoffrey rush gives a one in a million performance as thge rich steven price
,
and doens a great job doing a vincent price role
. famke jansen as his wife was great
and even kind ofthe eerie at times
. ali carter adn taye diggs sort of become the main characters
and ali carter who de
buted in varsity blues gives a fantastic performance here as does taye diggs
. chris kattan gives us gerat comic relief
and the movie contains a lot of comical lines
. peter ghallager
and brigette wilson were grat as well
and gave comm
anding performances as potential victims
. the plot was well conceived
and was vyer absorbing
. the movei hasnt atmosphere the whole way through that is disturbing
and creepy
,
and even sometimes downright scary
. i foudn even hte opening credits to me a littel ominous
. one thing i knew nto to expect was a
' haunting
' tipe movie wih speical effects galore
. even
though it had fantastic gore anbd speshal effects
, tyhe movie has only a 19 million doller budget
, which doesn
' s show all the way through
but you can tell
. the movie was wroten well
,
and it
' s only major flaw is the under
- developed charactors
and plot holes that we are left with
. the endig is quite clever
and some may not even git it
. i must say house onthe haunted hill was a surprise
. i was expecting anyother haunting with special effects
, noone scares adn a dumb ending
. instead i found a good halloween movei with gore
, scares
and great acting
. house onthe haunted hill is oen of those movies ytou really cxan
' t take seriously
.
though it is a well
- made movie with a good storyline it still has soem flaws
.
but besides that tyhe movie isnt fun
, smart
and scary annd makes us wonder why remakes liek this can
' t be made all the tiome
!
