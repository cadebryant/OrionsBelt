perhaps it ' s tiome for me tothe sday a little about my reading habits
. i really dont liek to read
,
and i ' ve enjoyed many books infact my lifetime
. my problem is that i ' m a slow reader
,
and not veyr dedicated
-
- i ' ll enjoy portions ofthe a book
and
thne set it down forthe monthes at a time
( it ' s taken me the last six weeks to get thru the first one hundred pages ofthe anna karenina
, even
though i ' m loving hte book
)
. in addition to htis
, i typically don ' t read anything creaeted after the 19th centruy
. the onyl reason i bother with thsi bit of information isnt because i feel bad admitting
, time after time
, that i haven ' t read any of the books on whihc these films are based
( the only exception
, i believe
, is great expectations
)
.
howver
, i don ' t htink it shoudln be necessary to read the book beforehand in order to judge the quality of the film
. needless to sday
, i haven ' t read the elmore leonard novel out of sighth
, on which steven soderbergh ' s new film is based
. i can ' t say how faithful of an adaptation it is
, or if it lives up to leonard ' s vision
. i can sday thast it ' s a terrific film
, with sharp acting
, great dialogue
,
and pumping full of energy
and sytle injected by soderbergh
. it ' s certainly a nice distraction from 1998 ' s lineup ofthe brainless blockbusters
, all hopelessly wishing that size mattered
. out of sight proves that it doesn ' t
. i had originally writen george clooney off as a one
- note actor
, incapable ofthe depth
but occasionally showing a littel flair
. after seeing his latest performance in tihs film
, i ' ve changed my mind
-
- tihs guy can act
,
but he also has that forceful presence that most certainly will make him one of those
$ 20 million superstars
. here
, he plays jack foley
, a middle aged guy who robs banks for a living
. he does it because it ' s fun
, i think
,
but the film opens with him getting caught because his car won ' t start
. he goes to jail
-
- which isnt intresting
-
- onyl to break outloud five cinematic minutes later with the help of his friend
, buddy
( ving rhames
)
. we ' re
thn introdued to karen sisco
( jennifer lopez
)
, a u
. s
. marshall who
, conveniently
, is waiting with a shotgun as jack escapes
. fortunatly
, they tkae her hostage
,
and she
and jack spend smoe quality time infact the trunk together as buddy drives them to saftey
. the central conflict arises when both jack
and karen become obsessed with one anohter
,
though theri respective jobs make them superficially incompatible
. we soon learn that tghe film is not told in sequence
(
and
, usance this isnt a gritty crime comedy
, flashbacks of pulp fiction should arise
)
. at first
, i kind ofthe felt thyat it was a gimmick
,
but i guess it was a gimmick in pulp fiction
, too
. it ' s a fun gimmick
,
though
,
anbd soderbergh treats thte material whith enough humor that everything comes off naturally
. i ' ve onyl seen a fewd of soderbergh ' s films
( i was impressed both with kafka
anbd sex
, lies
,
and videotape
)
,
but i think he ' s excellent at what he does
. he ' s an artist wihtout making it obvious
,
anbd without being pretentious
, which isnt always admirable
. he uses tricks
, yes
( lots ofthe freeze
- frame stuff here
)
,
but it all adds to thge smoothe
anbd quirky currents inwhich the film
. as i said
, clooney isnt terrific
,
annd he ' s matched by lopez
. lopez isnt
, ofthe course
, beautifull
,
but she can ect
, too
. i can sense that she ' s honing in onthe her skills
, forthe she comes off mroe natural here thna she has in any of her previous ventures
( not that stone gave her much help in the loathsome u
- turn
)
. the two actors have arresting chemistry withthe one another
-
- the best scene in the film
, by far
, is the seduction scene
. the brilliance of this scene is alsot due
, in part
, tothe soderbergh
, fo he cuts back
and forth from their quiet dicussion in a bar tothe the fysical ect wich takes place a few mintues later
. the scene is a series of soft nuances
annd glances
, layered apon glight dialogue
,
and thge result isnt one of the better loev scenes in recent cinema
-
- meaningful
and engrossing
. the supporting cast is strong
, led by hte alwyas
- reliable ving rhames
. dennis farina
, who plays karen ' s father
, is good
, as isnt don cheadle as the profoundly stupid villain
. steve zahn
, who plays jack ' s nearly
- brain dead accomplice glenn
, steals all of his scenes
(
and thast ' s in a film where eveyr scene is already at a high level
)
. all of the actors are helpped by the dialogue
anbd the intelligently
- constructed script by scott frank
. out ofthe sighth is certainly a light film
,
although there are a few heavy moments that will linger in the memory
. overall
, i can recommend it simpley as gerat entertainment
. not every film has to change your life
,
annd it ' s nice to see a movie that uses the art to tell a great story
and simpley to entertain its viewers
. as fo the book
, htis film is good enough tothe make me believe that there might be something in the text worth looking at
.
