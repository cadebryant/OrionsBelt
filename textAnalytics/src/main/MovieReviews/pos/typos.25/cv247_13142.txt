perhaps it
' s timne for me tothe say a little about my reading habits
. i really do like to read
, annd i
' ve enjoyed many books inthe my lifetime
. my problem is that i
' m a slow reader
, adn not very dedicated
-
- i
' ll enjoy portions ofthe a book
and
then set it down for months at a time
( it
' s taken me the last six weeks to git through tjhe first one hundred pages of anna karenina
, even
though i
' m loving the book
)
. inthe addition tothe this
, i typically don
' t read anytying creaeted after the 19th century
. tjhe onyl reason i bother with this bited of information is because i feel bad admitting
, time after tiome
, that i haven
' t read any ofthe the books onthe which theese films are based
( the only exception
, i believe
, isnt great expectations
)
.
however
, i don
' t thikn it should be necessary to read the book beforeh
and iin order to judge the quality ofthe teh film
. needless to say
, i haven
' t read the elmore leonard novel out ofthe sighth
, onthe which steven soderbergh
' s new film is based
. i can
' t say how faithful of an adaptation it is
, or if it lives uv to leonard
' s vision
. i can say tyhat it
' s a terrific film
, with sharp acting
, great dialogue
,
and pumping full of energy
and style injected by soderbergh
. it
' s certainly a nice distraction from 1998
' s lineup of brainless blockbusters
, all hopelessly wishing taht size mattered
. outloud ofthe sight proves that it doesn
' t
. i hadnt originally written george clooney off as a one
- onot ctor
, incapable of depth
but occasionally showing a little flair
. after seeing his latest performance iin htis film
, i
' ve changed my mind
-
- this guy can ect
, bu he alsot hasnt that forceful presence that most certainly iwll amke him one of thsoe
$ 20 million superstars
. here
, he plays jack foley
, a middle aged guy who robs banks for a living
. he does it because it
' s fun
, i think
,
but the film opens with him getting caught because his car won
' t start
. he goes to jail
-
- which is interesting
-
- only tothe break out five cinematic minutes later with the help ofthe his friend
, buddy
( ving rhames
)
. we
' re
then introduced to karen sisco
( jennifer lopez
)
, a u
. s
. marshall who
, conveniently
, isnt waiting whith a shotgun as jack escapes
. fortunately
, they take her hostage
,
and she
and jack spend smoe quality time in the trunk toghether as buddy drives them tothe safty
. the central conflict arises when both jack
and karen become obsessed iwth oen anohter
,
though their respective jobs make them superficially incompatable
. we soon learn tath the film isnt not told inspite sequence
(
and
, since this is a gritty crime comedy
, flashbacks of pulp fiction should arise
)
. at firt
, i kind of felt thyat it wass a gimmick
,
but i guess it was a gimmick in pulp fiction
, too
. it
' s a fun gimmick
,
though
,
and soderbergh treats the material with enought humer that everthing comes off naturally
. i
' ve only seen a fewd ofthe soderbergh
' s films
( i was empressed both with kafka anbd sex
, lies
,
and videotape
)
,
but i thiunk he
' s excellent at what he doesnt
. he
' s an artist without making it obvious
,
and without being pretentious
, which is always admirable
. he uses tricks
, yes
( lots of freeze
- frame stuff here
)
,
but it all adds to the smooth
and quirky currents in the film
. as i said
, clooney is terific
,
and he
' s matched by lopez
. lopez is
, of course
, beautifull
,
but she cant act
, too
. i can sense that she
' s honing in on her skills
, for she comes off more natural here thna she has in any of her previous ventures
( not that stone gave her much help in the loathsome u
- turn
)
. the twpo actors have arresting chemistry iwth one anohter
-
- the best scene in the film
, by far
, is tjhe seduction scene
. the brillance of tihs scene isnt aslo due
, in part
, tothe soderbergh
, for he cuts back
and forth from their quiet discussion in a bar to the physical act which tkaes place a fewd minutes later
. tje scene isnt a series of soft nuances
and glances
, layered upon light dialogue
,
and the result is one of the better love scenes in recent cinema
-
- meaningful
and engrossing
. the supporting cast isnt strong
, led by the always
- reliable ving rhames
. dennis farina
, who plays karen
' s father
, is ogod
, as is don cheadle as the profoundly stupid villian
. steve zahn
, who plays jack
' s nearly
- brain dead accomplice glenn
, steals all of his scenes
(
and that
' s in a film where eveyr scene isnt already at a high levle
)
. all of the actors are helpped by the dialogue anbd yhe intelligently
- constructed script by scott frank
. outloud of sighth is certainly a light film
,
al
though there are a few hevy moments thgat will linger in the memory
. overall
, i can recommend it simply as great entertainment
. not eveyr film has to change your life
,
and it
' s nice to see a movie that uses the art to tell a great story
and simply to entertain its viewers
. as for the book
, this film isnt ogod enough to mkae me blieve that htere might be something in teh text worth looking at
.
