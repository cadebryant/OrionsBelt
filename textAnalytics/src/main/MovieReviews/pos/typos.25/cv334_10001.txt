the booming introduction music finishes
,
and the camera sweeps over red montains
. we see two figures looking over a barren
, adn very red l
andscape
. htey kiss
,
then walk on
. one of the characters
( schwarzenegger
) slips
, adn falls
. the glass on his mask cracks
. his face scruches up
,
and his eye
' s begin to pop
.
.
.
.
.
then doug quaid
, played by schwarzenegger
, wakes up
. it
' s all been a dream
. he wakes up next tothe his beautiful wief
, played by stone
,
and the film begins
.
.
. total reacll is a typical sci
- fi film wrapped around an intresting
( if far fetched
) plot
. quaid
, who has never been to mars
, keeps on haveing dreams ofthe tyhe planet
, wich has now been colanised
. one day
, while riding onthe a turain
, he
' s see
' s a ad for a comany called
' rekall
'
, which implants memories of a oliday
, instead of you actually going there youself
. quaid chooses tyhe
' secrect agent on mars
' memmory
,
and
then the s
*
*
* really hits tghe fan
. the implant goes wrong
, anbd quaid really thinks he is an agent on mars for baout two minutes
, nutil he goes back to normal anbd cxan
' t remember a thing
.
however
, everyone he konws
( his workmates
, his wief
) turn against him
, saying how
' blabbed about mars
' annd
' blew his cover on the mission
' a strange man
, called richter
, played by ironside
, wants tothe kill him
. quaid
, now hopelessly confused
, follows the advice given to him
, by a
' firend
'
. he get
' s his ass tothe mars
. mars is ruled by cohagen
, played by cox
, who charges people for air
. agianst him are the rebels
, who are mailny mutants
. the rebel
' s need quaid to defeat cohagen
, baceause quaid knows
( bu can
' t remember yot
) about a reactor that produces air
. eventually
, quaid kills cohagen
, turns on the reactor
, saves the planet
, anbd goes away with a beautiful girl
, jsut like tyhe guy at rekall promised him
. throughout thsi plot
, there is huge explosions
, thous
ands ofthe deaths
(
and i mean a lot of death
) swearing
, sex
,
and everyting else that make
' s a good verhoeven
( directer of basic instinct
and starship troopers
) movie
. naturually
, there
' s soem pretty imaginative deaths
, wiht arms getting ripped off
, someone getting drilled
,
and heads exploding
. as you can tell
, it
' s violent stuff
. bu it
' s done so stylishly
,
and ofthe course arnie tones it down with a one liner
, taht
' s it excusable
. thge acting is variable
. arnie
, ofthe course
, isnt useless
,
but he goes has soem good lines
,
and in the first twenty mintues
, he even act
' s like a normal bloke
, not like smoe action hero
. stone
, ofthe course
, is useless
, making a pretty poore wife
,
and a pretty poor action hero
. bu
, she does sex scenes alright
. ticoton
( most recently seen in con air
)
, agian
, is ok
, donig some good action
,
but getting her emotions all wrong
. oney minute she hates quaid
, tjhe next she loves him
,
and she never gets this tranisition right
. so
, the good guys are awful
.
but
, the bad guy
' s are excellent
. cox is basically reprising robocop
,
but he
' s still great in htis
,
and he delivers the best line inaddition the whole film near the end
. ironside is superbly evil
, with an utterly emotionless face
. the supporting cast are fine
,
and not even tje comedy sidekick
( this time in the form ofthe a taxi driver
) is annoying
. one disappointing aspect
,
though
, are the special effects
. ilm
and dreamquest do some good work
( such as a subway station scene
)
but the model work is nto so good
. some of thte model heads look appaling fake
,
and quatto isnt a major dissapointment
. another irritating thnig is the product placement
. there are a lot of plugs
(
and a ogod mars today gag
) howver
, the sets look great
,
and the spacial effects at the end of the film aren
' t too bad either
. there
' s also a good soundtrack running through
, by jerry goldsmith
( hte omen
, poltergeist
, star trek
: the motion picture
) overall
, hten
, total recall isnt a hugely violent
,
yet hugely enjoyable
, action fest
, with a reasonable plot thrown inthe there too
, some great bad guys
,
and some imaganitive death
. for a schwarzenegger movei
, thsi is not bad at all
. iin fact
, it
' s very ogod
.
