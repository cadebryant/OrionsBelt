one year has passed since the last time we saw them
,
and
but wayne campbell
and garth algar are back
but
, they
' ve moved outloud of their parents homes
,
and now have theri pwn pad in an ab
andoed warehouse
. wayne
' s still hopelessly infatuated with his girlfriend
, cass
andra
,
and of course garth is still having his pwn
, personal growing pains
. they guys are just finishing off one ofthe their shows
, anbd head off to an aerosmith concert where they run across cass
andra
and her new manager
, a stereotypical industry slime nto unlike the charactor rob lowe potrayed in the previous film
. again
, the promoter isnt not onyl affter the money that cass
andra
' s talent can bring infact
. hte storyline quickly degrades to a parallel of teh original
,
" guy loses chick
, guy realizes misteek
, annd guy gets chick back
.
" fortunatly
, there is more tothe tihs movie than this somewhat sheer plot
. the wit
and humor in this film are surprisingly intelligent annd fresh with many inside jokes on the film
and music industries as well as just a lot ofthe hilarious scenes ofthe wayne adn garth showing their true colour
. highlights of the movie include a spoof of jurassic park
, garth
' s seduction by a married woman
, a surprise apperance by charleton heston
, a 1960
' s batman setup in the guy
' s pad
,
and some pretty groovy chats with jim morrison
and some
" naked indian guy
,
" an unexpected lip
- sync of ymca
( yuo could see that noe coming a mile away
)
and of course a hilarious parody of those badly
- dubbed kung
- fu movies we love tothe laugh at
.
and if you
' ve ever wondered why there
' s always boxes ofthe watermelons
, chickens
,
and people walking plate glass in the middle of streets
, you
' ll find out here
. this movie alsot explores wayne
and garth a little more
. garth hasnt somewhat of a
" coming of age
"
and wayne gets to learn a little baout himself
( with a little halp from our old firend
, jim morrison
)
. a few ood jokes from tjhe previous movie are explored here again
,
but tihs time with a few twists to keep them fresh
, anbd luckily
, few
, if any of them are overused
. overall
, the movie has plenty of continuity flaws
( especially in the fight scent bewteen garth
and cass
andra
' s dad
)
, bu these are easily overlooked as this is
, after wayne
' s world
. thte plot is flimsy bu managable
. there are a faw speshal effects
,
but they are fairly seamless
,
and fill nicely into the plot
. the acting is ogod
, for this sort ofthe movie
,
but there are some very bright spots
. in yhe big picture
, this movie is jsut plain fun
. ther isnt lots of intelligent humer that makes tihs film special
. during the whole one hour
and 40 minutes
, i didn
' t even thiunk baout looking at my watch a single time
. silly
, bu riotous at times
, thsi is an exelent movei even better than teh originnal
.
