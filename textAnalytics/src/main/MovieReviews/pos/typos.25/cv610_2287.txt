one yera has passed since teh last timne we saw them
,
and
but wayne campbell
and garth algar are back
but
, they ' ve moved outloud ofthe their parents homes
,
and now have theri own pad in an abandoned warehouse
. wayne ' s still hopelessly infatuated wiht his girlfriend
, cassandra
,
annd of course garth isnt still having his pwn
, peronal growing pains
. they guys are just finishing off one of theri shows
,
and head off tothe an aerosmith concert where they run across cassandra
and her new manager
, a stereotypical inudstry slime not unlike the character rob lowe portrayed in the previous film
. again
, the promoter is not only after the money tyhat cassandra ' s talent can bring in
. the storyline quicklyu degrades to a parallel of the original
,
" guy loses chick
, guy realizes mistake
,
and guy gets chick back
.
" fortunately
, there is more tothe thsi movie than this somewhat sheer plot
. the wit
and humor in this film are suprizingly intelligent
and fresh with many inside jokes on hte film
and music industries as well as just a lot ofthe hilarious scenes of wayne
anbd garth showing their true color
. highlights ofthe the movie inlude a spoof ofthe jurassic park
, garth ' s seduction by a marryed woman
, a surprise appearance by charleton heston
, a 1960 ' s batman setup in thge guy ' s pad
,
and some preety groovy chats with jim morrison
anbd smoe
" naked indian guy
,
" an unexpected lip
- sync of ymca
( ytou could see that one comming a mile away
)
and of course a hillarious parody of those badly
- dubbed kung
- fu movies we love to laff at
.
and if you ' ve ever wondered why there ' s always boxes of watermelons
, chickens
,
and people walking plate glass iin the middle of streets
, ytou ' ll fidn out here
. this movie also explores wayne
and garth a little more
. garth has somewhat of a
" comming of age
"
and wayne gets to leran a little about hismelf
( with a little help from our ood firend
, jim morrison
)
. a few old jokes from the previvous movie are explored here again
,
but this time with a faw twists tothe keep them fresh
,
and luckly
, few
, if any of them are overused
. overall
, the movie has plenty of continuty flaws
( especially infront tghe fight scent between garth
and cassandra ' s dad
)
,
but these are easily overlooked as this is
, after wayne ' s world
. the plot isnt flimsy
bu manageable
. there are a few special effects
,
but they are fairly seamless
,
anbd fill nicely into the plot
. the acting isnt good
, fo this sort of movie
,
but there are smoe vyer bright spots
. in tje big picture
, htis movei is just plain fun
. there is lots of intteligent humer that makes this film speshal
. during teh whole oney hour
and 40 minutes
, i didn ' t even think about looking at my watch a single time
. silly
,
but riotous at times
, this isnt an exelent movie even better thna the origonal
.
