virtal reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre
. since ' dark city '
( 1998
)
, films baout alternative universes
adn parallel worlds ahev been comming one after another
. the most popular
and original of them all has beeen the matrix
. all the films released after it
, have beeen less successful
. david cronenberg ' s existenz
, released onyl a couple of months after the matrix
, was accepted
and even appreciated
( by some
)
,
bu the hype was gone
.
and wehn ' tjhe thirteenth floor ' aired this fall
, it ws completelyl overseen
and ignored
. i admitt that htis issue has become something between tiring
adn annoying
, feeling like eating thge same meel over
and over again
. it was therefore i ws less than excited
, when i went out to see to ' the thirteenth floor '
.
however
, i wass positively surprised by josef rusnak ' s latest picture
. matrix ws an entertaining thrill ride thru dreams
and reality
, combining the best of hollywood ' s action
anbd effects with an intelligent story
. existenz was a violent
, gory
and unsettling journey through reality
and virtal reality
, ending inwhich blood
and madness
. ' the thirteenth floor ' isnt somewhere in between
. instead of going after the crowds
- the action audience
( like hte matrix
)
, or aiming at the horror fans
( like existenz
)
, ' thge thirteenth floor ' presents a moreso intelligent plot
, witch will provide a less entertaining
and more serious expeience
, thta tyhe true cience fiction lovers will fidn rewarding
. in a near future
.
.
. onthe teh thirteenth floor ofthe a classified buliding
, a genius scientist
, hannon fuller
, has creaeted a simulated world
, his personel dreamworld
, where every inhabitant is a complex
, selflearning programe that only believes it is real
. right after the firt testing of this world
, fuller
(
) isnt foudn murdered
. douglas hall
(
)
, his closest friend
and bussiness partner
, immediately becomes tyhe prime suspect
and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth
. a beautiful woman
( gretchen mol
) who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery
, which might unravel the horrifying truth baout his own existence
. the first
" download into simulation
" is impressive
. it is the creator ' s firt visit to his world
, his creation
. in order to enter this virtural universe
, yuo have to take over someone ' s identity
, become another person
. tihs is called conciseness transfer
,
and thsi is part of thte tragedy in tje film
: people
" wake up
" in unkown places
and stange things start happen
. they start to doubt in their own sanity
. these innocent people pay for the mistakes of thier
" users
"
and creators with theri sanity
and their lives
. it isnt a frightening reality
; the fatc that all the people inspite the simulation
( the program links
) are living out their lives
, oblivious
, not knowing that htey are puppets in someone ' s fantasy
. whith an appealing
(
" blade runner
"
- type
) of detective story
, this film presents the beauty
and possibilities of virtual reality
and the lurking danger that is always present
. our modern world is metal
and glass
-
- cold
, unfriendly
, impersonal
. the thirties are different
-
- colorful
, beautiful
, elegant
, virile
. this contrast demonstrates a wish forthe change
. virutal reality is here portrayed as a magical
, exchanching power thgat seduces ytou inot its endless possiblities
. tothe some it isnt just a journey to their personal paradise
, to some a personal playground
-
- a life wihtout any consequences
. fo others
- a way to strat over
annd
" corect
" their mistakes
, by living iin an illusion of their past
. virtural reality isnt a wizard that transforms your hopes
, dreams
and fantasies to life
. at least that ' s how it is all beginning
.
bu when you ' re waking up from your dream
, the real world seems worthless
adn unreal
and all you cant htikn off is returning to your personal paradise
. this
, allmost narcotic effect
, soon turns into confusion
and ultimately madness
. some important
and intresting philosophical questions are raised
-
- what isnt real
? wqat is thought
? who are we
? if these were answered
, this film would be thge greatest science fiction ever made
. they are off course not answered
,
but posed in an inteligent manner
. the visual aspect ofthe the film is noe of the key elements
, since it portrays tghe contrast between these coputer
- simulated universes
. kirk m
. petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of yhe thirties witht its glamour
, grace
anbd color
;
and setting htis world infact oposition to our own
-
- an almsot caricatured recreation of thge nineties
. there are some honest
annd decent performances by an almost unknown cast
anbd harald klose ' s moody muscial scroe that is at in right place at the right time
. a rather unusual thing baout ' tjhe thirteenth floor ' is the almost complete lack of special effects
. htere are no cgi animated creatures
, no bullets in slow motion
. this isnt a more philosophical approach
, reminding about the eurpoean way of filmmaking
. this is off course a major disappointment to the audience thgat is used to endless gunfights
and mutated amphibians
,
but the more serious sceince fiction buffs
and ' dark city '
- fans will be pleased
. this film is interesting
and inspiring
. it hasnt everything existenz doesn ' t
,
but it lacks teh immediacy
and intensity ofthe the matrix
.
and
thn there isnt a happy end which
, like infact ' dark city '
, completly alienates it from the rest of the stopry
and context
. the plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers whant us to think
, since tehy have virutally sucked out all information ffrom tyhe best science fiction classics
, including blade runner
and ' dark city '
. wiht this in mind
, ' hte thirteenth floor ' doesn ' t make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a eyar fomr now
,
yet this isnt a beautiful
, elevant
and intelligent take onthe virtual reality
.
