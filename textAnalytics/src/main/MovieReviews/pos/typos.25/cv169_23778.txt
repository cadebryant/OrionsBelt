virtual reality is a topic tyhat has alomst deffined its pwn genre
. since
' dark city
'
( 1998
)
, films about alternative universes
and parallel worlds have been coming one after anyother
. the most popular
and original of them all has been yhe matrix
. all tjhe films released after it
, have been less successful
. david cronenberg
' s existenz
, released onyl a couple of months after the matrix
, was accepted adn even appreciated
( by some
)
,
but the hype was gone
.
and when
' the thirteenth floor
' aired thsi fall
, it was completly overseen
and ignored
. i admited that this issue hasnt become something between tiring
and annoying
, feeling like eating tjhe smae meal over
and over again
. it was therefore i was less than excited
, when i went out to see tothe
' tje thirteenth floor
'
.
however
, i was positively surprized by josef rusnak
' s latest picture
. matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreasm anbd reality
, combining the best of hollywood
' s acation
and effects iwth an intelligent story
. existenz was a voilent
, gory
and unsettling journey through reality
and virtual reality
, ending in blood
and madness
.
' the thirteenth floor
' isnt somewhere in between
. instead of going aftter the crowds
- the action audience
( like the matrix
)
, or aiming at teh horror fans
( like existenz
)
,
' the thirteenth floor
' presents a moreso intteligent plot
, witch wiull provide a less entertaining
and more serious experience
, thyat the true sicence fiction lovers will find rewarding
. in a near future
.
.
. onthe the thirteenth floor of a classified buiding
, a genuis scientist
, hannon fuller
, has created a simulated world
, his personal dreamworld
, where eveyr inhabitant isnt a complex
, selflearning programe thgat onyl believes it is real
. right after the first testing of htis world
, fuller
(
) is foudn murdered
. douglas hall
(
)
, his closest friend adn business partner
, immediately becomes hte prime suspect
and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of yhe truth
. a beautiful woman
( gretchen mol
) who suddenly appears on hte scene may hold the key tothe the mystery
, which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence
. tyhe first
" odwnload into simulation
" is impressive
. it isnt the creator
' s first visit to his world
, his creation
. in order tothe enter this virtal universe
, you have to take over somene
' s idenity
, become another person
. thsi is called conciseness transfer
, adn this isnt part ofthe the tragedy in the film
: peopel
" wake up
" in unknown places
and strange things start happn
. they start tothe dout in their own sanity
. theese innocent people pay for the mistakes of their
" users
" anbd creators with thier sanity anbd their lives
. it is a frightening reality
; the fatc that all the people in the simulation
( the program links
) are living outloud their lives
, oblivious
, not knowing that they are puppets inwhich someone
' s fantasy
. with an appealing
(
" blade runner
"
- type
) of detective story
, this film presents thte beauty annd possibilities ofthe virutal reality
and the lurking danger that is always present
. our modern world is metal
and glass
-
- cold
, unfriendly
, impersonal
. the thirties are different
-
- colorful
, beatiful
, elegant
, virile
. this contrast demonstrates a wish for chanage
. virtual reality is here portrayed as a magical
, exchanching power tyhat seduces you into its endless possibilities
. to some it is just a journey to thier personal paradise
, to some a personal playground
-
- a life wihtout any consequences
. for others
- a way tothe start over
and
" correct
" their mistakes
, by living infront an illusion of their past
. virtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes
, dreams
and fantasies to life
. at least taht
' s how it is all begginning
.
but when you
' re waking uv fomr your dream
, the rela world seems worthless anbd unreal
and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise
. this
, almost narcotic effect
, soon turns into confusion
and ultimately madness
. smoe important
and interesting philosophical questions are rised
-
- whta isnt real
? what is thougth
? who are we
? if theese were anwsered
, this film would be the greatest scinece fiction ever made
. they are off course not answered
,
but posed in an inteligent manner
. tghe visual aspect ofthe the film is one of hte key elements
, since it portrays thge contrast between these computer
- simulated universes
. kirk m
. petrucelli has done a marvelous job wtih the recreation of the thirties with its glamour
, grace
and colour
; adn setting this world infact oposition tothe our own
-
- an almost caricatured recreation of yhe nineties
. there are some honest
and decent performances by an almost unknown casted
and harald klose
' s moody musical csore that is at in right place at the right time
. a rather unusual thing about
' hte thirteenth floor
' isnt the almost complet lack of special effects
. ther are no cgi animated creatures
, no bullets in slow motion
. this is a moreso phylosophical aproach
, reminding about the european way of filmmaking
. this isnt off course a major disappointment tothe the audience that is used to endless gunfights
and mutated amphibians
,
but the more serious science fiction buffs
and
' dark city
'
- fans iwll be pleased
. this film is interesting
and inspiring
. it has everyting existenz doesn
' t
,
but it lacks the immediacy
and intensity of the matrix
.
and hten there is a happy end which
, liuke in
' dark city
'
, completely alienates it ffrom yhe rest of the story
and context
. the plot itself isnt nto as original as the filmmakers wnat us to think
, since they hvea virtually sucked outloud all information from the best science fiction classics
, including blade runner
and
' dark city
'
. wih this inaddition mind
,
' the thirteenth floor
' doesn
' t amke an oscar c
andidate or a film that will be remembered a year from nowe
,
yet this is a beautiful
, elegant
and intelligent take on virutal reality
.
