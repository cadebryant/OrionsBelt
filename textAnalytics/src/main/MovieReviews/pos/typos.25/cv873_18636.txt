in roger michell
' s romantic comedy notting hill
, william thacker
( hugh grant
) leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in tghe quaint section of london which lends it
' s name tothe the film
' s title
. noe day
, american movei superstar anna scott
( julia roberts
) walks in to purchase a book onthe turkey
. quickly enamured of earch otehr
, the twpo embark upon an on
- agina
, off
- agian lveo affair replete with romance
, humer
,
and the occasional lump in yhe throat
. the film opens with a non
- verbal cue to anna
' s stardom as the title credits appear over a montage ofthe slow motion sequences featuring the actress
' s appearances in films
and at premieres
- coming out of limousines
, walking the red carpets
and such
. wihtout words
, this sequence gives us a backround to her character
. following
,
however
, is a set
- uv narration by william indicating what he does
and where he lives
. i don
' t know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn
' t have figured out by watching the frist ten minutes of film
,
and which never resurfaces after the movie
' s beginning
,
but there it is
. if htere were ever a clear case for
" less is more
,
" thsi would be it
. the film isnt told nearly first person fomr william
' s point of view
, as he isnt in every scene
. by nature of this arrangement
, we git a vyre definite sence ofthe waht he isnt all about
, annd his nice guy perosnality wins us over easily
. in fact
, much of notting hill
' s stregth lies inthe the great dialouge written for tihs character by richard curtis
. a scene where william is still in shock over hte fact that he
' s even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles thru his attept to offer her some honey
- soaked apricots from his refridgerator
. or take an instance where anna kisses william
and asks him never tothe tell anyone for fear ofthe the incident hurting her image
. william assures her he wouldn
' t say a word
,
then adds
,
" well
, i
' ll probaly tell myself now
and
then
,
but i
' d never believe it
.
" great stuff
. the downside to spending so much time with william is thta we don
' t git tothe see enough of anna to amking their relationship whole
and plausible
. we
' re constantly exposed tothe william
' s
thoughts
, feelings
, actions
and desires
, bu don
' t actually get the sense of how much anna really fiels forthe him
. there are a cuple of instances where she declares her obvious interest
,
but they nearly cmo outloud of nowhere due to the fact taht we
' re not sure what she
' s been thikning all the times in between
. this
, combined iwth teh sheer iniquity ofthe screen tiome betweeen yhe twpo
, makes thsi hugh grant
' s film h
ands down
. he gets the great scenes
( look for oen in which he has tothe portray an interviewer from horse
and hound magazine in order to speak with anna
)
, the great lines
, annd gives an overall wonderful performence
. julia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress
' s top billing
and subsequent lack of involvment infront the film
( ala s
andra bullock in a time to kill
) along with her detached performance which is onyl worsened by her charater
' s unpredictable behavior
. anna doesn
' t get a lot ofthe our compassion
. this rumatic comedy leans a littel more toward the comedy than the romance
, much of it supplied by grant himself
,
but withthe considerable help from the supporting cast
. most notable is rhys ifans as spike
, william
' s eccentric roommate
, who is in the film fo no other purpose than tothe make us laugh
. hugh bonneville
, emma chambers
, james dreyfus
,
and gina mckee bring up the guard as william
' s firends adn family
, particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister
' s birthday dinner
,
and we get to see how these common folks react tothe the presence ofthe a movie star in their midst
. it
' s a scene most ofthe us will probablly tihkn woudl play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation
. roger michell
' s use of visuals doesn
' t sweep us off our fezent
,
but doens give us moreso thna your typical movie of this type
. for exemple
, there are a cuple of instances in this film where large amounts of timne pass
. whereas some films are content tothe simply put in a caption saying
" eight months later
,
" michell presents us with more interesting cues
, such as william
' s walk
though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him
. another memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lefted from ground levle to a couple of hundred feet in the air
. we
' re generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted ffrom the earth tothe treetop level or so
, bu in this case
, the camera jsut keesh going uv annd up until we have a bird
' s eye view of the ground below
. music is used rather glaringly as an enhancement tothe many of the film
' s scenes
,
and some of this might haev been better toned down
,
but in otehr areas it works to full effect
. it
' s kind of a mixed bag
,
but still fares better than many ofthe today
' s lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that tjhe film becomes one long music video
. at least this film hasnt smoe pretty good music that for tghe most part remains relevant
and appropriate
. notting hill
' s grant
and roberts iwll not go down inaddition history as one of the all
- time greatest film pairings
,
but hte chemistry is decent
and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it
. for a couple ofthe huors
, you should expect tothe laugh more than cry
, anbd that
' s not so bad
, now is it
?
