barely scrapping by playing at a nyc piano bar
, timothy hutton returns tothe his massachusetts hometown for a cuple of weeks
. on thge surface
, he
' s comming home for a high school reunion
,
but since this is a movie
, you knwo that he
' s really looking for some major life decisions
. a fairly
" small
" film
, this sportscar an impressive ensemble cast including uma thurman
, rosie o
' donnell
and a bunch of actors that you
' ve seen before
but can
' t qutie palce
. commendable jobs all around
; they seem liuke real peple
. hutton arrives at his past
and is greeted by his spirit
- dead father
, terminally goony brother
and old high school chums
. all ofthe his ood buddies are engaged in tjhe snow removal business
and most are in tje midst of a relatiopnship crisis
. the perfect stuff forthe a comedy about people in the twenties angst
. he meets
and falls for tjhe new next door neighor
: a beautiful intelligent livley girl who is obviously taken with him
. the problem is thyat she is onyl 13
. unconsummated
( no
, it
' s not
_ that
_ type ofthe movie
)
, their relationship builds
and neither knows what to do with it
. star
- crossed lovers with no where to go
. so hutton is gaga over a bearly
- teen
, oen of his buddies isnt two
- timing his girlfriend with a married old flame
, another
' s girlfriend is sleeping iwth a meat cutter
(
"
and she
' s a vegetarian
!
"
)
. things are a mess
. enter uma thurman
. the beautiful stranger in town for a few days is both a delight inwhich thge film
and one of its minor downfalls
. her character isnt fun tothe watch
. even more entertaining is observing the guys falling over themselves trying to imbaress her
. like the lone ranger
, before she leaves
, she solves most of the problems annd sets everyone onward with thier lives
. tyhe ending is a bit too pat
. everthing is tied up with a neat little bow
. rosie o
' donnell is a st
and
- outloud in her limited screen time with her brash personality adn
" tell it like it is
" pronouncements
. structured somewhat like a
" diner
, a few yersa later
"
, this efel
- good story is a ogod time
, bu ends a little too nice
.
