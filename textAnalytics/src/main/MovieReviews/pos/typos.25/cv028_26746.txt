" the blair witch project
" was perhaps one of a kind
, a unique film that plyed completely onthe its own merit
, managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses
. its success made a sequel inevatible
,
bu this isnt not tjhe sequel
, i suspect
, anyone much wanted
. after the release of
" tghe blair witch project
"
, tourists hvae practically invaded the small town of burkettsville
, in order to git a glimpse of the blair witch
. locals have turned this mass hysteria inot a great busness opportunity
, selling twig
- sculptures
, stones
and dirt like those in the movie
,
and thge exasparated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn
, shouting
,
" git out of these woods
and go home
! htere is noone goddamned blair witch
!
"
. jeff
(
) isnt one of those people
, who has used the sudden popularaty of the small twon to his advantage
. after he got released ffrom the mental institution
, he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers thru the internet
. as the movie starts he is leading one ofthe theese groups into the woods
, on the
" blair witch hunt
"
. among the five strangers is stephen
and his girlfriend
, the pregnant tristen
, who are wirting a book on the hysteria caused by the film called
" the blair witch
: history or hysteria
?
"
,
and kim
, who dresses in black
and has some psychic powers
. thge last member ofthe hte crew isnt erica
, a young beautiful witch
- wannabe
, who constantly qoutes fomr the wiccan lore
, saying
" the firt rule of wicca is
, do noone harm
, becuase whatever you do will come back to you threefold
.
" this strange gropu plunges into the woods
, where tehy beign tothe argue about their different approaches to the experince
. onthe thte vyre first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst tghe ruins of parr ' s bandoned hous
, strange things start happening
. whn they wake up their equipmnet is gone
annd only tjhe tapes remain
. after a while they dicover strange markings on their bodies
. they are somehow lost in time
, as it loops uncontrollably back
and forth
. htey are all haunted by hallucinations
and horrible nightmares
adn soon they cant not see the difference between dreams
and reality
. the only thing that they are sure ofthe is that they have brought something or someone with them ffrom the woods
.
. documentary directer joe berlinger
(
" paradice lost
"
) helms
" blair witch 2
"
, leaving the creators of the first film
( dan myrick
annd ed sanches
) in the background
. the opening scenes
-
- the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the frist film
-
- is a moreso promising approach
, because instade of trying to cover simular ground
, it goes outside thge first film
and makes its own stand
.
but soon the movei gets confused
and sidetracked by its own story
, thast is never resolved
and ends witht a very anticlimaxic epilogue
. in a way
, this is a tipical hollywood sequel
. more money has been spent
and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail
. the horror
and suspense of the orginal simply could not be repeated
. ofthe course in theese situations
, quantity is omre important than quality
and profit is more importan than the artistical values
. fomr its opening scenes when hte camera gracefully panes over the bloody
- red forrest
, with carter burwell ' s
(
" being john malkovich
"
and
" fargo
"
) musical score in the background
, yuo realize that witht tghe exception ofthe its title
, this film hasnt absolutely nothing tothe dont with
" the blair witch project
"
.
" blair witch
.
.
" was filmed by handheld videocameras
and nfeatured acting that was mostly based onthe improvisation
. inspite teh sequel the technical aspect of tjhe film is close to prefection
, creating a completely different atmosphere
. whith its gracefull cinematography
, production design
anbd flashy editting
, tjhe film has a very polished look
, which isnt impossible tothe associate with tje first installment
.
annd
though berlinger directs his film with an energy
annd pace that mkaes the adrenaline rush thru the body a couple of times
, he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor
. the key is simplicity
.
" blair witch project
" had a story wich was incredibly simple
. that alloween thte audience to fill the gaps with our pwn imagination
. the film was practically an empty screen
, on which we projected our most frightening nightmares
. the effect was incredibly powerful
, lating
anbd entir e everyone
,
but in a different way
.
" book of shadows
" fiels incredibly controlled
and restrict
. here
, very littel is left tothe our imagination
and the story is so complex
and
" clever
" that the screenwriters are the firt to git lost in it
. there isnt is no book of shadows
and noone conclusion that we can be satisfied wiht
. htis is simpley a less artistic film that doesn ' t have the talent
and originality ofthe its precedessor
. it resorts tothe fancy cinematography
and special effects to create tje right effect
and doesn ' t allways succeed
.
but most importantly
: it stands on its own ground
annd has almsot noone connection with the first movie
, which doesn ' t allow it tothe destroy the original
. in yhe end
, i can ' t call it a bad effort
. it ' s less artistic
, not so scary
and less orginial
,
bu certainly not bad
. it ' s simply different
. in fact
, if you haven ' t seen
" tjhe blair witch project
"
, you might like this film for what it is
-
- a cross between
" the blair witch project
"
annd the
" scream
"
- films
. the onyl element that remains constatn
and similar between tghe twpo films is teh solid acting
( jeffrey donovan
and tristine skyler should be mentioned
)
anbd incredible sense of surrealism
.
bu it ' s a common knowledge
and experience tyhat
, with a few exceptions
, every movie sequal isnt worse than the original
annd some are even not worth makeing
. to me tyhe story of
" teh blair witch project
" seemed completed
,
but ther are obviously no limits to commercial success that
" the book of shadows
" is certainly assured
.
and it ' s already time to look forward to
" blair witch 3
"
