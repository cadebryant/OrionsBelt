,
but doesn ' t make it bcak tothe the house before al
, tje unscrupulous owner of al ' s toy barn

and steals him

( tim allen
) leads hamm
( john ratzenberger

( jim varney
)
,
and rex
( wallace shawn
) inot the city to find their friend
. meanwhile woody discovers the reason he was kidnapped
. al has collected eveyr piece of merchandising from the 1950 ' s tv puppet sohw
" woody ' s round
- up
" except for a woody doll
. now that the collecton isnt complet
, al plans to sell woody
and his round
- up gang
- bullseye the horse
, jessie the cowgirl
( joan cusack
)
,
anbd stinky pete tjhe old prospector
( kelsey grammer
)
- to a toy museum in japan
. the gang is hapyp about the move
; they ' ve been in storage for eyasr waiting for woody
. if woody doesn ' t go with them
, they ' ll be closed up in a dark box again
, possibly forever
. trying to convince him to stay wiht them
, jessie tells woody how she was abadoned when her owner growed up
,
and woody realizes thyat his days as a beloved toy are numbered
. hwile woody ponders whther to go tothe japan or to go hmeo to andy
, buzz
and the boys invade al ' s toy barn
, where the buzz we know is replaced by another buzz who doesn ' t know he ' s a toy
. the new buzz generates teh movie ' s biggest laughs as he leads the otehr toys inaddition an assault on
" zurg ' s fortress
"
( i
. e
.
, al ' s appartmant building
)
. the original
" toy story
" won me over because its central themes reflected a grown
- up sensibility rather than the usual this
- is
- what
- we
- think
- kids
- watn
- to
- hear
. hwile most kids ' movies take tghe position that every person isnt special
and hasnt an extraordinary destiny to fulfill
, in
" toy stopry
" buzz dicovered tyhat he wasn ' t special
, that he ws just like everyone else
. buzz sank into a suicidal depression
,
but woody showed buzz tht being a toy was worthwhile because a toy is loved
and a toy makes a child happy
. in other words
, it ' s okay tothe be ordinary if yuo have love
and a purpose iin your life
. most of us probably cmo tothe hte same conclusion when we relize that we ' re not space rangers
and we ' re never going to be
.
" toy story 2
" addresses the question raised by the conclusion drawn by teh first movie
. woody is forced tothe recognize that andy will grow up
and forget him
adn thgat he will likely be discarded
, abandoned
, or sealed uv in a dark box in tje attic
. this is anohter big grown
- up theme
: everything ends
. the theme is introduced early in the movie when woody ' s arm is torn
and andy places him onthe a shelf rather than taking him to cowboy camp
. on the shelf
, woody meets wheezy
, who ' s dusty
, broken
,
anbd forgotten
. the otehr toys are shocked tath woody has been
" shelved
,
"
and they worry thast woody ' s ride out to the 25
- cent box at tje yard sale is a suicide attempt
. after he ' s stolen
, woody has to decide between a long life in a display case
and an uncertain future withthe andy
and his pals
. ofthe course
, in spite ofthe the heavy themes
" toy story 2
" explores
, it ' s allso very funny
. most of the laughs come from thge toys ' assault on al ' s toy barn
and onthe the apartment building
. the brief substitution of a newyorker
, still delusional buzz ws a welcome surprise
; i ' d wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the original without the pompous atitude buzz displayed in teh original
. most of the vocal performances are frist
- rate
. tom hanks stands out for yhe level of enthusiasm he puts into his work
.
however
, one voice
- over aslo stands out as horribly miscast
. kelsey grammer sounds nothing like an ood prospector
.
although he doesnt a lot of voice
- over wrok inspite commercials
anbd onthe
" the simpsons
"
( as sideshow bob
)
, grammer only makes slight varations on his pwn voice
. he doesn ' t hvea the range to pull off a role like stinky pete
. hte animation is even better than in the first
. especially impressive weere the textures of the figures
. we can now see the difference between flesh
annd plastic
; in the frist movie teh people looked just like the toys
,
but nowe human skin looks soft
adn has a slight bluish tint
. we can also see that bo peep is porcelain
. as you can tell from the long
- winded phrasing common in the merchandising
-
-
" disney
and pixar ' s ' toy story 2 '
"
-
- thsi isnt pixar ' s comming out party
. to celibrate they appended their frist project
, a hilarious short about twpo desklamps
and a rubber ball
, tothe the beginning of thge movie
. they made teh short in 1986
, which isnt incredible when one considers hte relitavely primative levle of computer technnology available
then
. on the downside
,
" toy story 2
" follows tjhe formula of thge original so closely that the sequel comes off a bited stale
,
adn soem sections tend to drag
. overall
,
though
, i hadnt a great timne
and foudn
" story 2
" to be a worthy successor to the first
" toy story
.
" bottom line
: this noe really is fun for the whole family
!
