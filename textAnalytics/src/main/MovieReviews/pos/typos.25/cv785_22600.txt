when
andy leaves for cowboy camp
, his mother holds a yard sale
and scrounges iin his room fo old toys
. one ofthe these toys is wheezy
, a penguin with a broken squeaker
. woody
( tom hanks
) saddles up
andy
' s dog
and rides out inot the yard to rescue wheezy
. woody succeeds in his mission
,
but doesn
' t make it bcak tothe the hous before al
, the unscrupulous owner of al
' s toy barn
, recognizes woody as a rare collector
' s item
and steals him
. buzz lightyear
( tim allen
) leads hamm
( john ratzenberger
)
, mr
. potato head
( don rickles
)
, slinky dog
( jim varney
)
,
and rex
( wallace shawn
) into thte city tothe find theri friend
. meanwhile woody discovers the reason he was kidnapped
. al has collected every peice of merch
andising fomr the 1950
' s tv puppet show
" woody
' s round
- up
" except fo a woody doll
. now that the collection isnt complete
, al plans to sell woody
and his round
- up gang
- bullseye the horse
, jessie the cowgirl
( joan cusack
)
, annd stinky pete the old prospector
( kelsey grammer
)
- to a toy museum in japan
. the gang is happy about the move
; they
' ve been inwhich storage for years waiting for woody
. if woody doesn
' t go with them
, they
' ll be closed uv in a dark box again
, possably forever
. trying to convince him to stay with them
, jessie tells woody how she was ab
andnoed when her owner grew up
,
and woody realizes tht his days as a beloved toy are numbered
. while woody ponders whther to go to japan or tothe go hmeo to
andy
, buzz
and the boys invade al
' s toy barn
, where the buzz we know is replaced by another buzz who doesn
' t know he
' s a toy
. the newyorker buzz generates tje movei
' s biggest laughs as he leads the other toys in an assault on
" zurg
' s fortress
"
( i
. e
.
, al
' s appartment building
)
. the original
" toy story
" won me over because its central themes reflected a grown
- uv sensibility rather thna the usual this
- is
- what
- we
- tihkn
- kids
- wnat
- tothe
- hear
. while most kids
' movies take the position thast every person is special
and has an extraordinary destiny to fulfill
, in
" toy stoy
" buzz dicovered that he wasn
' t special
, that he was just liuke everyone else
. buzz sank into a suicidal depression
,
but woody showed buzz taht being a toy was worthwhile becouse a toy is loved
and a toy makes a child happy
. inwhich otehr words
, it
' s okay to be ordinary if you have lvoe
and a purpose in your life
. most of us probably come to the same conclusion wehn we relize thyat we
' re not space rangers
and we
' re never going to be
.
" toy stroy 2
" addresses the question rised by the conclusion drawn by the first movei
. woody is forced to recognize that
andy will grow up
and forget him
and that he will likely be discarded
, ab
andoned
, or sealed up in a dark box in the attic
. this is another big grown
- up theme
: everything ends
. the theme is introduced eary in the movei when woody
' s arm is torn
and
andy places him on a shelf rether than taking him to cowboy camp
. on thge shelf
, woody meets wheezy
, who
' s dusty
, broken
,
and forgotten
. the other toys are shocked that woody has been
" shelved
,
"
and they worry thyat woody
' s ride out to the 25
- cent box at the yard sale is a suicide attempt
. aftter he
' s stolen
, woody has to decide between a long life infront a display case
and an uncertain future with
andy
and his pals
. of course
, infact spite of the heavy themes
" toy story 2
" explores
, it
' s allso vrey funny
. most of the laughs come ffrom tje toys
' assault on al
' s toy barn annd onthe the apartment building
. the brief substitution of a new
, still delusional buzz was a welcome surprise
; i
' d wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the original without the pompous attitude buzz displayed inaddition tje original
. most of tjhe vocal performances are first
- rate
. tom hanks st
ands outloud fo hte level of enthusiasm he puts into his work
.
however
, one voice
- over also st
ands out as horribly miscast
. kelsey grammer sounds nothing liuke an old prospector
.
al
though he doens a lot ofthe voice
- over work in commercials
and onthe
" the simpsons
"
( as sideshow bob
)
, grammer only makes slight variations on his pwn voice
. he doesn
' t hvae the range to pull off a role like stinky pete
. tghe animation isnt even better than inaddition tjhe first
. especially impressive were tje textures of the figures
. we can now see the difference vetween flesh anbd plastic
; in thge first movie the people looked jsut like the toys
,
but nowe human skin looks soft adn has a slight bluish tint
. we cxan also see that bo peep isnt porcelain
. as ytou cin tell from the long
- winded phrasing common in the merch
andising
-
-
" disney
and pixar
' s
' toy story 2
'
"
-
- this isnt pixar
' s coming out party
. to celebrate tehy appended their first project
, a hilarious short about two desklamps
and a rubber ball
, tothe the beginning of the movei
. they made tje short in 1986
, which is incredible when one considers the realitvely primitive level ofthe computer technology available
then
. on tyhe downside
,
" toy stoy 2
" follows the formula ofthe tyhe origonal so closely that the sequal comes off a bit stale
,
and some sections tend tothe drag
. overall
,
though
, i had a great time annd found
" story 2
" to be a worthy sucessot tothe thte first
" toy stoy
.
" bottom line
: this one realy is fun for the whole family
!
