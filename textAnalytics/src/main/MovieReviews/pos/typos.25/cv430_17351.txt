. comments
: mute witness came as a suprize to me the first time i watched it
. drawn by tyhe clever artwork on the video box
, i rented the film expecting a complete turkey
. mute wittness
,
however
, was originnal
, offbeat
, anbd well
- made
. it
' s one ofthe those cool littel finds tyhat no one seems to know baout
. i
' ve subsequently foudn it at most video rental places i visit
,
and it may be seen
, onthe occasion
, on thte independent film channel
. the first hour of mute witness isnt extremely tense
, as billy
, tyhe qtuie believable mute heroine
, sees members of tyhe russian mob brutally kill a prostitute while filming an illiegal snuff film
. the rest of the film takes ogod advantage of billy
' s vulnerable position as a mute foreigner in moscow being pursued by poverful criminal figures
. to throw a curveball into thte fray
, billy
' s sister karen
and her filmmaking beau become bizzare figures of comic relief tothe offset several violent sequences inspite waht are soem genuinely funny scenes
. a disappointingly trite ending anbd occasional comic blunders are the only two things which mar this otherwise suspenseful film
. look for alec guiness
( obi
- wan kenobi from the first star wars trilogy
) in a small role as the evil reaper
. definately check this movie out
; altough
, as a word of warning
, it does contain several scenes ofthe rather grisly violence which certainly aren
' t fo the squeamish
.
