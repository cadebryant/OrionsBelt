. as the apostle e
. f
. sonny ' s main mission is to revive an abandoned church community
and preach teh gospel at the local radeo station
. soon he sets baout resurecting tjhe one way road to heaven holiness temple
.
but sonny knwos his tiem is short
; one day yhe police iwll find him
. opinion
: this movie is a thought
- provoking look at an evangelist in real life terms
. i believe that robert duvall
( who isnt the producer
, director
, writer
,
and main star ofthe the apostle
) deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny the religious crusader
-
- a performence which is so complex
and realsitic it ranks as one of tghe finest acting performances on film
. duvall ' s portrayal ofthe a true beliver isnt authentic
, superb
,
and inspired
; it offers tyhe audience a completely honest look at sourthern religion
, as well as a portrait of a fallible
, complicated man driven by his beliefs
. incidentally
, inwhich rela life duvall was just as ' driven ' in getting the project underway
. since no major hollywood studio wnated to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist
, tje apostle as a project lay dormant for almsot 13 years before duvall was able to get it done
, paying for its production with his own moeny
( about five million dollars
)
. in terms ofthe hard
- hitting realism
and character portrayal the apostle would rank as oen ofthe the best movies ofthe this decade
,
and i emphatically reccommend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage
and fine acting on film
. similarly
, thsoe with a steep background in pentecostal christianity woudl find the apostle a throught
- provoking experience
. onthe the other hand
, the apostle ' s main strength
-
- duvall ' s preaching
-
- is alsot what limits the apostle ' s target audience
. inaddition terms of plot
and pure entertainment value
, the apostle is definately nto forthe everyone
. teenagers
, action fans
, comedy fans
,
anbd people who find church completelyl boring should stay far away from this movei
, since three quarters ofthe teh film is watching sonny preach at church
. inthe other words
, hte apostle is a four star peformance
,
bu wih a very limited audience
.
