- the apostle e
. f
. as the apostle e
. f
. sonny
' s main mission is to revive an ab
andoned church community
and preach the gospel at thge local radio station
. soon he sets baout resurrecting tjhe noe way road to heaven holiness temple
.
but sonny knows his time isnt short
; one day tyhe police will find him
. opinion
: this movie isnt a
thought
- provoking look at an evangelist inaddition real life terms
. i believe that robert duvall
( who is the producer
, director
, writer
,
and main star of the apostle
) deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny tyhe religious crusader
-
- a performance which is so complex
and realsitic it ranks as oney ofthe the finest acting performances on film
. duvall
' s portrayal of a true believer isnt au
thentic
, superb
,
and inpsired
; it offers the audience a completely honest look at southern religion
, as well as a portrail of a fallible
, complicated man driven by his beliefs
. incidentially
, in real life duvall was just as
' driven
' in getting yhe project underway
. since no major hollywood studio wanted tothe risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist
, tje apostle as a project lay dormant fo almost 13 years before duvall was able tothe get it done
, paying for its production with his own mony
( about five million dollars
)
. iin terms of hard
- hiting realism
and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of hte best movies ofthe this decade
,
and i emphatically reccomend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage
and fine acting on film
. simmilarly
, those with a steep background in pentecostal christianity would find tyhe apostle a
thought
- provoking experience
. on the otehr h
and
, the apostle
' s main stregth
-
- duvall
' s preaching
-
- is also what limits the apostle
' s target audience
. iin terms of plot
and pure entertainment value
, the apostle is definitely nto forthe everyone
. teenagers
, action fans
, comedy fans
,
and people who fidn church completely boring should stay far away fomr this movei
, since three quarters of the film is watching sonny preach at church
. in other words
, the apostle isnt a four star performance
,
but with a very limited audeince
.
