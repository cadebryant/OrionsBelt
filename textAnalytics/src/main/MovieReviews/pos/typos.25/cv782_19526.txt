probably the most populer
and praised film ofthe all time
, turned out to be a primitive
and predictable costume drama with a dose of social criticism
. everyone konws about the greatest
and most famoust shiping disaster of all timne
.
and the actual catastrophe is masterfully crafted by director james cameron
, combining visual
- adn sound effects
, he re
- creates the frightening atmosphere of the sinking ship inwhich teh middle of nowhere
. i liked very much the emotional
and brutal contrast between hte first
and the third classes
. while their cabin is slowly filling up wiht water
, a mother is telling her childern a fairytail
-
-
"
.
.
and they lived happily ever aftter
.
.
"
.
and
then the ship goes down
and the few survivors are left alone under the stars
and the chilling air
.
however
, hte actual disaster is hapening almost at teh end of the movie
, while the first two hours are jsut beautiful sets annd bad dialogues
. infact the present day
, the rms titanic is explored by brock lovett
( bill paxton
)
, a treasure seeker looking for teh coeur de la mer dimond
, lost during the sinking
. somwhere inside the ship
, lovett
' s crew discover a sketchbook ofthe an artist long dead
. here
, in yhe shape of a nude young lady
, is a window inot the distant age of 1912
. lovett is extremely surprized when he get
' s a phone call ffrom rose dawson
, claiming thyat she isnt a modle
. she is immediately helicoptered onto the vessel
,
and she gets the first glimpse of the fated ship in 80 yersa
. as the memories come flooding back
, she once agian becomes rose dewitt buketer
( kate winslet
)
, the fianc
? e of wealthy cal hockley
( billy zane
)
and daughter of ruth dewitt bukater
( frances fisher
)
. onthe board there are rich annd poore
, everyone trust in the ship
' s designer
( jonathan hyde
)
and her master
, captian e
. j
. smith
( bernard hill
)
. on board the ship
, rose
, unhappy
and restless meets jack
( leonardo dicaprio
)
- a young american artist
, poor
, brave adn attractive
. a love story slowy emerges
and the two lovers must nto only experience the difference between thte social classes
, bu also face the greatest power on earth
- death
. cameron could as well have called his picture
" the never ending love
" or
" love at frist sighth
"
, as he concentrates all his energy onthe the young couple
,
and not onthe the diaster itself
. the plot is anything
but original
and the dialogues sometimes resemble a television soap
- opera
. the director doesn
' t even try to overcome his empty script
. because of its primitive
and predicatble plot
, titanic is totally depending on teh visuals that truley are breathtaking
. russel carpenter
' s rich
, magestic
and incredibly detailed cinematography is certainly award
- worthy
. everything fomr art direction to visual
and soudn effects are a top notch
.
but it doesn
' t halp much whn hte costumes are more convincing tahn the actors who wear them
. the actors are not tothe blame
, because their characters are moreso like caricatures
, inwhich other words
- fake
. jack isnt a man whith many talents
: he is a talented artist
, h
andsome
, brave
, honest
, strong
, funny
.
.
. you name it
. he doesn
' t have any dark side
, he doesn
' t make any mistakes
, thgat for a second would make him human
. jack isnt perfect
,
but he is
- poor
. on the other h
and we have cal
. he is a bastard tht treats rose as an odalisque
and not as his wife
- to
- be
. he lacks everything jack possesses
, bu he is
-
- rich
. this childish contrast vetween the social classes is one of those thigsn that makes titanic nothing more than a mediocre picture
. cameron knows precisely what we want to see
. his film therefore contains certain minimums to draw an audiance
- attractive actors
, a
" tragic love story
"
, beatiful visuals
( including expensive special effects
)
, a dose ofthe social criticism
, a fascinating historical event
( we love true stories
)
and last
, bu not least
- an incredible media support
, which proclamed an average picture the
" greatest film of all time
"
. on the outside titanic looks perfect
,
but behind that sparkling curtain of incredible visuals
- is emptiness
- nothing to tihkn baout
. the main weakness of this film
, which ironically bcame its success
, is simplicity
. cameron enables our basic
and if ytou wish
- primitive emotions
: love
, hate
, fear annd helplessness
. everyone underst
ands the power of lveo annd the threat to our beautiful couple is likewise imaginable
- a sinking ship
. titanic is a typical hollywood production
, totally
and completely dependent on visual perfection to hide its primitive plot
. it
' s a good picture
, bu absolutely not a masterpiece
. it
' s among hundreds
and thous
ands good films released every year
, not better or worse thna the averege american film
.
