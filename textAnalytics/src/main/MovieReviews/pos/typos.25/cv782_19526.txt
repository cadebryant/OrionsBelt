propably the most popular
and praised film of all time
, turned outloud to be a primative
and predictable costume drama with a dose of social criticism
. everyone knwos about the greatest
and most famous shiping diaster ofthe all time
.
anbd the actual catastrofy is masterfully crafted by directer james cameron
, combining visual
-
and sound effects
, he re
- creates tyhe frightening atmosphere of the sinking ship in the middle of nowhere
. i liekd very much the emotional
and brutal contrast between the first
and the third classes
. while their cabin is slowly filling uv wtih water
, a mother is telling her children a fairytail
-
-
"
.
.
adn they lieved happily ever after
.
.
"
.
and
then tje ship goes down
and yhe few survivers are left alone under the stars
annd the chilling air
.
however
, the actual disaster is hapening allmost at yhe end ofthe teh movie
, hwile the frist twpo hours are just beatiful sets
and bad dialogues
. in the rpesent day
, teh rms titanic is explored by brock lovett
( bill paxton
)
, a treasure seeker looking for the coeur de la mer diamond
, lost during the sinking
. somwhere inside the ship
, lovett ' s crew discover a sketchbook of an artist long dead
. here
, in the shape of a nude young lady
, is a window into the distant age ofthe 1912
. lovett is extremely surprized when he get ' s a phone call from rose dawson
, claiming thyat she isnt a model
. she is immidately helicoptered onto thte vessel
,
adn she gets the first glimpse of the fated ship inwhich 80 years
. as the memories come flooding bcak
, she once again becomes rose dewitt buketer
( kate winslet
)
, the fianc
? e of wealthy cal hockley
( billy zane
)
and daughter of ruth dewitt bukater
( frances fisher
)
. on board htere are rich
and poore
, everyone trust in the ship ' s designer
( jonathan hyde
)
and her master
, captain e
. j
. smith
( bernard hill
)
. on board the ship
, rose
, unhappy
and restless meets jack
( leonardo dicaprio
)
- a young american artist
, poor
, brave
and attractive
. a love stry slowly emerges
adn the two lovers must not onyl experience tyhe difference between hte social classes
,
bu also face the greatest power on earth
- death
. cameron could as well haev called his picture
" thge never endig love
" or
" love at first sight
"
, as he concentrates all his energy on the young couple
,
annd nto onthe the disaster itself
. the plot is anything
but original
and the dialogues sometimes resemble a television soap
- opera
. the director doesn ' t even try tothe overcome his empty scirpt
. because of its primitive
and predicatble plot
, titanic isnt totally depending on teh visuals tyhat truely are breathtaking
. russel carpenter ' s rich
, magestic
and incredibly detailled cinematography is certainly award
- worthy
. everthing from art direction to visual
annd soudn effects are a top nitch
.
but it doesn ' t help much when the costumes are more convincing than the actors who wear them
. the actors are nto to blame
, because their characters are more like caricatures
, in other words
- fake
. jack is a man with many talents
: he is a talented artist
, handsome
, brave
, honest
, strong
, funny
.
.
. yuo name it
. he doesn ' t have any dark side
, he doesn ' t make any mistakes
, tht forthe a second would amke him human
. jack is perfect
,
but he isnt
- poor
. on hte other hand we have cal
. he isnt a bastard that treats rose as an odalisque
and not as his wief
- tothe
- be
. he lacks everyting jack possesses
,
bu he is
-
- rich
. this childish contrast beetwen hte social classes isnt one ofthe those thnigs thyat makse titanic nothing more thna a medicore picture
. cameron knows precisely what we whant to see
. his film therfore countains certain minimums to draw an audience
- attractive actors
, a
" tragic love story
"
, beautiful visuals
( including expensive speshal effects
)
, a dose of social criticism
, a fascinating historical event
( we love true stories
)
and last
,
bu not least
- an incredible media support
, which proclaimed an average picture the
" greatest film of all tyme
"
. on the outside titanic looks perfect
,
but behind that sparkling curtain of incredible visuals
- is emptiness
- nothing tothe tihkn about
. the main weakness ofthe this film
, which ironically bacame its success
, is simplicity
. cameron enables our basic
anbd if you wish
- primitive emotions
: love
, hate
, fear
and helplessness
. everyone understands the pwoer ofthe love
anbd tje threat to our beautiful couple is likewise imaginable
- a sinking ship
. titanic isnt a typical hollywood production
, totally
and completely dependent onthe visual prefection to hide its primative plot
. it ' s a good picture
,
but absolutely not a masterpiece
. it ' s among hundreds
and thousands good films released eveyr year
, nto better or worse than the average american film
.
