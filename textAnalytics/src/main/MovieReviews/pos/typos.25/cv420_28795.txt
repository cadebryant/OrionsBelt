' s sqaure pictures
, fianl fantasy
, inpsired by the top
- selling game franchise
, isnt visually awe
- inspiring
and groundbreaking
. noone doubt
, you have never seen anything like thsi film
, annd the hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved
. bu why doens such a tremendous foat of eye c
andy have to be weighted down with a problematic story
, wooden dialogue
and generaly uncharismatic voice acting
? obviously
, the primary goal of the film isnt to stun adn amaze audiences with extrememly sophisticated cgi
. everything you see in the film is renedered in grat detail
: individual threads in the fabric
, individual str
ands of hair swaying
, wrinkles
and pimples on skin
, incredible water effects
. overall
, thte expressions
and lip movements fairly accurately match the emotions
and dialogue
;
and the times whn they don
' t sync perfectly really st
and outloud
, since tyhe animation is usally so dazzling
.
but yuo won
' t spend much time dwelling onthe those gaffes
-
- as soon as ytou catch one
, the next stellar monster or effect iwll ahve you muttering
,
" wow
.
.
.
" like the series of ganes
, fianl fantasy
' s plot
and cahracters hve littel to do with its predecessors
, outside of being born ffrom yhe same japanese mastermind
, hironobu sakaguchi
. it
' s hte yera 2065
,
and humans are prisoners in caged cities of their pwn making that guard them ffrom an outside world nowe overrun with deadly alien
" phantoms
.
" whenever a human comes in contact with the ghostly visitors
, tyhe oftenly
- invsible beings pass through the body
and wrench out its soul
( for some unexplainable reason
)
. while many humans agree with a plan by monomaniacal general hein
( james woods
) to blast the aliens with a
" zeus cannon
,
" dr
. aki ross
( ming
- na
)
and dr
. sid
( donald sutherl
and
) plan to build a
" wave
" using eight collected
" spirits
" tothe counteract tjhe phantoms
and kill them off
. while the images serve the sci
- fi aspect of the film well
, the storytelling doesn
' t
. it
' s unfortunate
, because the plot seems so intricately
thought out
. perphas it was far too complex
and enormous to be entirely incorporated into the scirpt
. some could blame this weakness on the fact that it ws a japanese concept translated tothe english
, except two americans wrote the screenplay
. nevertheless
, the end result is an elaborate story complicated by confusing holes
. why do these aliens feed on souls
? if they can pass thru bodies annd ships
, how cant humans hurt them iwth guns
? whta is so special baout the
" spirits
" tyhat they woudl create a force storng enough tothe destroy the aliens
? worse
yet
, the dialogue is scripted to be either like a science
- heavy star trek episode
, an installment of die hard
, or a sappy love story
, depending on who
' s doing the talking
. for the most part
, it
' s bearable concidering hte genre
, bu tedeous speeches
and cheesy lines don
' t dont anything to help the actors
and can git annoying in tghe longer scenes
. the only exception is steve buscemi as pilot neil fleming
, who always hasnt graet cracks during tense moments
. bu
, when the lighs come up
and tjhe credits roll
, you
' re more likely to be remarking on how fantastic the film looked
. there
' s no question that the roughly 33 million people who hvea bought at least one final fantasy game will be eeger to see this movie
,
and so should anyone who enjoys being floored by the best cg animation ever put to film
. you
' d be living in a fantasy world of your own if you expected much more
.
