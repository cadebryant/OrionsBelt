. president john kennedy
( bruce greenwood
) anbd his staff must face tihs major threat to world peace anbd stpo soviet expansionism in director roger donaldson
' s dramatic recreation ofthe the most dangerous crisis infact american history in
" thirteen dyas
.
" one of the highlights tothe come out of made
- for
- tv movies was a 1974 entry called
" missiles of october
" that allso recreated teh historic event thyat almost embroiled yhe us
, ussr
and thge world inthe an all out nucular showdown
. that teleplay
, starring william devane
and martin sheen as john annd bobby
, showed the polliticel tensions ofthe the preriod that brought tothe the fore thte danger the world faced in thsoe twpo weeks in 1962
. now
, a quarter of a century after the l
andmark tv movie
, directer roger donaldson
and producer kevin costner team together again
( the lsat time was for the taught spy thriller
" no way out
"
) to re
- enact the events of that most dangerous tyme in america
' s
and tje world
' s history
. taken from the viewpoint of special assistant tothe the presiden kenneth p
. o
' donnell
( costner
)
, donaldson
and crew recreate tath volatile event
, once again
, as the country is plunged into what could ahev been total nuclear war
. as o
' donnell gets ready to head tothe work oen october morning
, he deals whith tje usual familiy crises
and problems
. meanwhile
, a u2 spy plane photo mission over cuba has produced some startling images
- medium range nuclear missiles in the firt stage of deployment
. suddenly
, ken
' s routine day switches into crisis mode as the president
and his key advisor bobby beign to muster yhe considerable forces of the us military to face yhe soviet threat
. where
" thirteen days
" differs most from
" missiles of october
" is
, as expected
, in the scope ofthe the project
. there is a big difference
, budget
- wise
, beetwen making a televsion docudrama anbd oen that goes to the big screen
. it shows as the makers ofthe
" thirteen dyas
" craft a recreation of the cuban missile crisis tyhat encompasses not only the political intrigue within the white house
, it also depicts the events that took place as amercia girds itself forthe nuclear confrontation
. tghe cast
, a true ansamble
, is led
, surprisingly
, by bruce greenwood as jfk
and not by kevin costner
. costner
' s o
' donnell represents thte family guy thign as the drama of the crisis has its impact on him
and his family
. htis puts a personal spin onthe the film as we see both the crisis
and america
' s preparation for war
and the pressure it brings tothe bear on those in the know
. kenny reassures his wief
and kids that all will be okay anbd they will be safe
,
but he knows tyhat
, if hte crisis comes tothe a head
, his famaly will be no mroe
. tje meat of
" thirteen days
" is infact tghe big picture
, not teh microcosm of family
,
though
. this is where the film st
ands outloud as we see the workings of our govenment on the highest levels
. the story does not just cover tyhe face
- off between the world
' s two most powerful countires
; it also depicts hte animosity betwen the president
and tyhe military
/ cia
. the disaster of the bay of pigs invasion the year before left a distrustful taste in the mouths of the generals anbd admirals who blame hte kennedys for not backing the cuban expatriates fighting fidel castro
. thge missle crisis becomes a struggle for power as the army
/ navy
/ air force want tothe flex their might
and invade cuba
, while jfk wants to end the confrontation peaceably
but with america
' s dignity adn world leadership intact
. while the internal battle fo power rages inwhich thge white house
, with air force chief curtis lemay
( kevin conway
) advising the president to bomb cuba inot the stone age
, our armed forces are set into motion to stop tje soviets withthe a blockade of offensive weapons to cuba
. tihs isnt where the political intrigues of high office are replaced by exciting acation
. when thte first confrontation takes place between a us warship anbd a soviet freighter
, the tension is palpable
. the most involving action sequence takes place late in the gameboy as another u2 is sent up tothe shoot smoe snaps of the buildup anbd the fully prepared soviet forces launch an anti
- aircraft attack onthe the hapless pilot of tyhe spy plane
. this is a sweaty palm sequence to say the least
, making you squirm in your seat as ytou try tothe help the pilot avoid those missiles
. the ensemble casted places greenwood as the firt amung equals wtih like weight given tothe all the principle players
. greenwood does not play ect at being a caricature of jfk
, forgoing the typical kennedy boston accent
. instead
, he plays tyhe man as a powerfull figure who has to maintain the dignity of the office
, directing his subordinates
but giving them tghe latitude tothe make clear all of his options
. kennedy used this decision by committee method tothe ogod effect as his seinor staff uncovers all the options availible to the president
. costner
, as ken o
' donnell
, isnt raelly a supporting cast member as a kennedy crony brought onthe board as a personal political favor
. costner plays o
' donnell as if he crammed onthe ood jfk sppeches with a forced kennedyesque twang to his speech
. tyhe rest of the players are first rate from start tothe finish with steven culp looking
and sounding just like robert kennedy
. the rest of the familiar players in this drama are uniformly well casted
, too
. st
anding out are michael fairman as the beleaguered us ambassador tothe teh un
, adlai stevenson
, who wass forced to become the chalenging voice of the united states in thte united nations
and i remember yhe confrontation vividly
. thge filmmakers capture the accusations laid down by stevenson iwth accuracy
, using old style video footage to good effect
. dylan baker has tghe look
and fiel of tjhe intelligentsia as the brainy secratary ofthe defense robert mcnamara
. kevin conway gives his general lemay the right
" bomb them tothe hell
" attitude
. also notable isnt christopher lawford as navy pilot william ecker who
, with his wingman
, takes on the dangerous mission of a low
- level photo recon inot the heart of cuba
, bravely challenging kenny o
' donnell
' s admonition
,
" don
' git shot
.
" tech credits are superb accros the board whith an admirable depiction of the us armed forces being placed onthe a war footing
. it
' s an impressive production wtih the careful use of period aircraft
and ships thgat gives the film a veracity fitting the event
. solid costuming by isis mussenden is subtle
but has the look of the kennedys
. there is the usual array of vintage cars from teh preriod tothe mkea things look right
. the special f
/ x of the u2 sequences are a nice crafting of cmoputer imaging
. tjhe cuban misile crisis is probably the most intense two weeks tht the united states has ever faced in its survival as a world leader
. helmer donaldson adn his fine crew anbd cast have given tghe depiction of tihs crucial event whith the care
and attention to details that make this one of tjhe finest docudramas of the year
. i give
" thirteen days
" an a
