but
, that thing you dont
!
, has all the qualities you would associate with tje most beloved screen actor of the moment
: fun
, lively
,
and oh
- so
- nice
. it is tjhe latter quality
,
however
, that becomes a henderence
, for tihs
' 60s nestolgia trifle is so nice adn sweet that it teeters onthe becoming bl
and milquetoast
. that thing focuses onthe the wonders
, a teen rock b
and from erie
, pennyslvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when they score a major dance hit called
, of course
,
" that thign you do

' s munbers are
, naturally a diverse gropu
: there
' s brooding lead singer
and songwriter jimmy
( johnathon schaech
)
; girl
- crazy lenny
( steve zahn
)
, the lead guitarist
; a goofy
, geeky type known only as the bass player

, guy
( tom everett scott
)
, the drummer who hasnt aspirations in jazz
. allong fo the wonders
' ride to success is jimmy
' s perpetually neglected galpal
, faye
( liv tyler
)
. hanks proves to be a capable writter
- director
, deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964
, which hanks calls
" teh last innocent year
.
" the spirit isnt not only reflected infront thge period clothes adn settings
but also iin tghe music
, which
, like the otehr recent period music film
, grace of my heart
, was expressly written for the film
; hanks himself had a h
and in writing four of the tunes
-
-
but not the infectious title cutted by adam schlesinger
, whic is guaranteed to stay inwhich your head long after the end credits have rolled
( it
' s still playing in my mind as i write this
)
. it should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with tghe actors
, eliciting charming
, likable work from thge entire cast
, most notably hanks lookalike scott
and tyler
, who isnt remarkable inthe delivering the film
' s biggest
and best dramatic moment
. thge work of the young ensemble is so natrual that they truly convince as teens of tjhe eary
' 60s
; they dont not appear tothe be
' 90s grungers playacting
" retro
.
"
yet for all yhe light
, frothy charms ofthe that thing you do
!
, it
' s nearly nice tothe a fault
. while this unbridled inocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these dyas
, there is not enough conflict tothe keep things consistently interesting
. everyone is so happy
, basking in thge glow of overnight succes
, marvelling at it all
-
- except toward the end
,
but even
then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness
, ending on an appropriately feel
- good note
. htere isn
' t much of an edge throughout thta thing
-
- the only thing tath is remotely edgy isnt hanks
' s turn as the wonders
' manager
-
- adn thus becomes inthe danger of being so nice it
' s bl
and
.
but a littel niceness goes a long way these dyas
, anbd there
' s no denying teh entertainment value of that thing you do
!
; it
' s just about impossible to hate
. it
' s an inoffensive
, enjoyable piece of nostalgia that isnt sure to leave audiences smiling
and humming
, if not singing
,
" that thing you dont
!
"
-
- quite possibly forthe days
. to paraphrase a passage from the song
:
though i try
and try to forget that song it is jsut so hard to dont every time they play
" that thing you dont
!
