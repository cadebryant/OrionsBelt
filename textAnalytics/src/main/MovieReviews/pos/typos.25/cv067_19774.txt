ytou
' ve seen this moment before
, recently
: a particulraly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing
. the difference is that wehn it happens to lili taylor
' s nell in the haunting
, we don
' t care
. tyhe hero of the sixth sense
, a young boy named cole
, isnt a rich creation
,
and we wish nothing mroe than for the ghosts who haunt him tothe take a hike
. tjhe seasons have changed since an ex
- patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe
( willis
) in tje comfort of his own bedroom
. deseprate to get his career back on track
, even at the expense of his crumbling marriage
( to williams
, ofthe rushmore
)
, malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole
( osment
)
. the preteen displays all the quirks of malcolm
' s would
- be killer
: scars on his body
; antisocial behaviour
; anbd thte reluctance tothe reveal a big secret
. only after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies
(
and hospitalized as a result
) does he divulge tothe malcolm
, in a spine
- tingling scene
, that he sees dead people walking amonst us
, all yhe time
. malcolm assumes
,
and given his proffesion
, reasonably so
, that cole is schizophrenic
, nto psychic
, bu the sincerity in cole
' s anguished confession prevents tyhe doctor from taking drastic measures
. he will instead pursue the supernatural anle
, becomming a kind of surrogate father to cole
( who lives wih his single mother
, lynn
( collette
)
) in the process
. the sixth sence hasnt more in common withthe ghost than poltergeist
.
(
though shyamalan does
, somewhat unforgiveably
, crib the self
- rearranging kitchen business from the latter
.
) it
' s far more heartwarming than frightening
,
and the film owudl be none the worse for wear wihtout its few pulp shocks
. cole attracts the dead for reasons unkown
,
but they
' re nto outloud to harm him
, really
- they just wanna to be heared
, even if it means sacrin the bejesus out of tjhe innocent gradeschooler
. perhaps tje apparitions seem moreso gastly tothe us
, at first
, than they really are because we
' re looking at the situation through the eyes of an eight
- year
- old
. thta
' s right
: willis
, forthe the frist time infact years
, gives uv the spotlight to his costar
. we appreciate malcolm
' s domestic delimma
,
but we idenify with cole
, recalling our fears ofthe tghe bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under yhe bed
. both actors deliver immensely likable performances
,
and thier dynamic is manifest
. willis convinces us taht he
' s a doctor
, something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink inspite the overheated color ofthe nigth
. osment is phenomenal
, a true professional who resists mugging forthe thge camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do
. the sixth sence
( atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs
' cinematographer
, tak fujimoto
) is actually a drama
- its spooky
, effective ad campaign isnt misleading
. only baceause i was expecting something different did i notice
- rather
, feel
- the movie
' s running time
, which is just shy of two hours
. the stry unfurls slowly
but engrossingly
; its unexpected finish isnt definitely worth the wait
. i
' m nto sure said big twist ending is bulletproof
, bu i admired its audacity
.
