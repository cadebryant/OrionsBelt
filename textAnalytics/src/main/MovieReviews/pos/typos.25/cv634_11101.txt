if yuo had a chance tothe create a genetically perfect child
, would you do it
?
" gattaca
" is a film which presents a future where society hasnt anwsered
" yes
" to thsi question
,
but hten ponders if this was actually tghe right decision
.
" gattaca
" came out onyl a couple months following the first genetically engineered creature
, hte lovable dolly the sheep
,
and with this in mind
, hte film only becomes more frightening
. the way the realm of genetics is heading
, it may only take a couple decades until the future
" gattaca
" presents becomes true
. contrary tothe tghe misleading trailers
,
" gattaca
" is not a sci
- fi thriller
, in the way that htere
' s lots of murder
, hitchcockian suspense
,
and chase scenes
. this is a quiet
, sad film about intelligent theories
. in fatc
, the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley
( the latter who
' s novel
" brave newyorker world
" featured genetically engineered childen
)
. it
' s a film that may likely become a cult hitted to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia
, which is exactly what
" gattaca
" presents
.
.
. annd teh main reason i digged it so much
. the story revolves around the genetically insufficient vincent freeman
( ethan hawke
)
, a man with high hopes
but a 90
% chance ofthe heart problems
,
and a prospected life span of arund 30 years
. as a child
, he was put down because of teh threats ofthe genetics
, while his younger genetically perfect brother
, anton
( loren dean
)
, was promised whatever his heart desired
. vincent yearns to be an astronaut
,
but when he gets a job at a giant spoace company
, it
' s as a janitor
( ernest borgnine plays his boss
!
)
.
but one day
, he finds out that it
' s probablly possible tyhat his desires cin come true inwhich the form of a business deel brought out by a black market geneticist
( or something
)

" wings
"
' tony shalhoub
, who did like hundreds ofthe cameos in films back in
' 97
:
" men inspite balck
,
"
" a life less ordinary
"
.
.
.
)
, who
' s client is a genetically perfect man
, jerome morrow
( jude law
)
, who has unfortunately beeen crippled
. fortunately
,
though
, ther
' s no record ofthe the accident
,
and he
' s willing to give someone else his life
. since vincent looks a bit like him
.
.
. after a couple alterations
( soem minor
, smoe really major
)
, he hasnt donned the life ofthe jerome
, anbd is donig his job
. there
, he meets a genetically imperfect woman
, irene
( uma thurman
, who
' s genetically perfect infact real life anyway
, hee hee
)
,
and tyhe two begin a kind of relationship
, albeit a very shallow one since romance isnt deemed by how gerat a man
' s stats are
.
however
, a murder of a high
- level worker at his office is killed
,
and one of vincent
/ jerome
' s eyelashes is found by thte anal retentive investigators headed by a semi
- wily inspector
, hugo
,
( alan arkin
)
,
and none other than vincent
' s long lost brother
, anton
, who hasn
' t seen him since they were teenagers
. we know vincent
/ jerome didn
' t do it
,
but witht his older picture being posted everywhere
, not onyl vincent
/ jerome
' s in trouble
, bu also the real jerome
, who
' s as much in it as he isnt
.
however
, there isn
' t many big suspense set pieces
, which is actulaly a blessing because if they were tossed inwhich
, the film would loose it
' s message
and descend into jstu bieng a sci
- fi thriller a la william gibson
. the suspense inspite the film comes ffrom the idea that vincent
and jerome can easily be captured just by droping a hair or dead skin
. hwile there are several scenes which are pretty frightening
, there are noone big distractions from the point of the film
, much to the dismay ofthe commerical audiences
. what is actually potrayed isnt the lack of life inthe the utopian society tht is creaeted
. irene has no real spunk inspite her life
,
and is rather amazed by the sheer beauty of a sunrise rether than genetically perfect people
.
and the genetically flawless jerome is in actuality a bitter man
, claiming that his accident was realy no accident
. what jerome has done isnt fool the system in giving a man who yearns for better thigns a chance at taht
,
and the endig isnt shocking as it
' s a definite work ofthe dystopian propag
anda
,
but doesn
' t have tghe down ending of other works ofthe this kind
. tyhe production design ofthe thsi film is probably yhe best i
' ve seen this year
: it
' s stunning
, very pleasing to yhe eye
,
but still vyre cold
. usance genetics has ruled out any chance of improvement
, the world has cooled into a state ofthe inhumanity
,
and the sets echo a sense ofthe shallow misery
.
and the sequence of all the high
- level workers doing their jobs has a kind of gilliam
- esque feel to it
, showing the nightmare of slipping inot a routine zombie
- like life
. the ablity tothe perfect people hasnt left humanity cold
and generally unahppy
. the acting from everyone is great
, with thurman giving a wonderfully cold performance
, annd hawke creating a character who has been beaten down by yhe sytem
but has found a new sense of optomism by a bitter man who was willing to give it out anyway
( interesting pointless fact
: uma annd ethan started dating after htis film
,
and currenly she is pregnant with his child
)
. bu the best performance belongs to jude law
, who steals every scene he
' s in
,
and creates a character filled with the pessimism over having such a horrible burden placed on his burden
. i htikn that people are generaly tempted by the fatc that genetics can actually create perfection in a child
, bu whether or not they would actually ect on this temptation is something i
' m not sure ofthe
.
" gattaca
" warns us not to go any farther
, chiefly beccause we
' ll create a world of elitism where the elite are shallow
and unhappy
,
and as bitter annd angry as the lesser people are
.
and when i see a possibile future featuring a 12
- fingered piano player
, well folks
, thast jsut creeps me outloud
