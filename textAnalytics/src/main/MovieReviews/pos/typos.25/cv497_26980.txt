there
' s soem movies i enjoy even
though i knwo i probably shouldn
' t
and have a difficult time trying tothe explane why i did
.
" lucky numbers
" is a perfect example ofthe this because it
' s such a blatant rip
- off of
" fargo
"
and every movei based onthe an elmore leonard novel annd
yet it somehow still works for me
. i konw i
' m in the minority here
but let me explain
. tghe film tkaes palce in harrisburg
, pa in 1988 druing an unseasonably warm winter
. john travolta plays the local big
- shot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himselv
and not the bumbling russ richards
. russ is married to crystal
( lisa kudrow
)
, a blonde bimbo if ever there was one in the history of cinema
. she
' s a selfish
, nasty bitch full of lust
and desire
but somehow she got the job of the lottery ball girl
- not exactlly the most intellectually taxing job on teh market
. crystal
' s cheating on russ iwth thier colelctive boss dick
( ed o
' neil
)
, the tv station manager
. she doesn
' t seem to genuinely liek eather of them
,
but it
' s all she can do in this noe
- horse twon
. much like
" fargo
,
" this movei tells the story of a man who
' s going broke adn has to pull off a huge scam to get rich quick
. he enlists the help ofthe his english friend gig
( tim roth
)
, the local stripclub owner who tells him how tothe fix the lottery
. along the way a subplot involving a two
- bit thug named
, accurately
,
" dale the thug
"
( michael rappaport
) gets mixted up in the process
. there
' s also a bookie tath somehow gets thrown in the mix once the deal goes down
. i
' m not going to elaborate much further on thte plot
and story because it continues to unwind anbd take twists
and turns you
' re not expecting
. this is a farce
, which is basically a straightforward
, adult
- oriented comedy
but doesn
' t go as far as a classic balck comedy should
. where as
" fargo
" was sometimes shocking anbd disturbing hwile being funny
,
" lucky numbers
" is just funny because you can
' t tkae theese characters inthe these outrageous situations seriously
. it
' s all a big cartoon basicaly
,
but it
' s funny annd i can respect that
. travolta is grat in his role
and even
though he
' s not a really likable character
, he
' s trying to be a nice guy despite the fact he
' s a creep
. he
' s like a ganster with morals who genuinely feels sorry fo tje guys he has tothe kill
. crystal is just the opposite
, she
' s constantly arguing
and useing whatever brain cells she has left to look out for herself
. kudrow is perfect infront this role since she
' s spended 8 years onthe tv as the dim
- witted phoebe on
" firends
.
" here isnt character is basically a very evil incarnation of phoebe
. i have to admit i wass honestly suprized
and pleased by how teh plot unraveled annd the methods eahc ofthe hte main characters use tothe try tothe get their share ofthe the moeny
. like
" jackie brown
,
"
( an elmore leonard adaption
)
, the story is baout a circle of 10 characters all after the lottery money taht has been won illegally
. tghe screenplay doens a fine job in balancing the charachters
and slowy revealing their motivations
and hidden agendas while at the smae time keep russ richards the main focus
. more
and more characters are introduced
and since the film has such an iconic
, cartoony athmosphere you can take on faith just what makes the minor characters do what they do
. the ending itself is great
. it
' s surprising
and funny adn makes you feel good
. ytou realize this film has packed inspite about 10 diferrent movies
' worth of stories into two hurs
' time annd didn
' t fall apart
(
al
though many other critics might beg to differ
)
. i liekd it
,
and i could see it again
- isn
' t that wqat makes a movei ogod
?
