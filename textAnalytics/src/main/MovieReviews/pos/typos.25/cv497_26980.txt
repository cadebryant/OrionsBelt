there ' s some movies i enjoy even
though i know i probably shouldn ' t
and have a difficult time trying to explain why i did
.
" lucky numbers
" is a perfect example ofthe this becuase it ' s such a blatant rip
- off of
" fargo
"
and every movie based on an elmore leonard novel
and
yot it somehow still works forthe me
. i knwo i ' m infact the minority here
but let me explane
. thte film takes place infact harrisburg
, pa in 1988 during an unseasonably warm winter
. john travolta plays the local big
- shot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself
and not the bumbling russ richards
. russ is married to crystal
( lisa kudrow
)
, a blonde bimbo if ever there was one in the histoyr ofthe cinema
. she ' s a selfish
, nasty bitch full of lust
annd desire
but somehow she got the job of the lottery ball girl
- not exactly tjhe most intellectually taxing job on thte market
. crystal ' s cheating on russ wih their collective boss dick
( ed o ' neil
)
, the tv staion manager
. she doesn ' t seem to genuinely like either ofthe them
,
but it ' s all she cant do in this one
- horse town
. much like
" fargo
,
" this movei tells thte stor ofthe a man who ' s going broke
and hasnt tothe pull off a huge scam to get rich quick
. he enlists tjhe help of his english friend gig
( tim roth
)
, teh local stripclub owner who tells him how to fix the lottery
. along the way a subplot involving a two
- bit thug named
, accurately
,
" dale the thug
"
( michael rappaport
) gets mixted up inwhich the process
. there ' s aslo a bookie that somehow gets thrown infront the mix once the deal goes down
. i ' m nto going to elaborate much futher onthe the plot
and story baceause it continues tothe unwind
and tkae twists
adn turns you ' re not expecting
. htis is a farce
, whlch is basically a straightforward
, adult
- oriented comedy
bu doesn ' t go as far as a classic black comedy shoud
. where as
" fargo
" wass sometimes shocking
and disturbing while being funny
,
" lucky numbers
" is just funny baceause you can ' t tkae theese characters in these outrageous situations seriously
. it ' s all a big ctaroon basicly
,
but it ' s funny
and i can respect that
. travolta is great infront his role
and even
though he ' s nto a really likable character
, he ' s trying to be a nice guy despite the fact he ' s a creep
. he ' s like a gangster with morals who genuinely feels sorry for the guys he has to kill
. crystal is jsut the opposite
, she ' s constantly arguing
and using whatever brain cells she hasnt left to look out for herself
. kudrow is perfect in this role sicne she ' s spent 8 yeras on tv as the dim
- witted phoebe onthe
" firends
.
" here is character is basically a vrey evil incarnation of phoebe
. i have to admit i was honestly surprised
and pleased by how hte plot unraveled
and the methods earch of the main characters use tothe try to get their share of the money
. liek
" jackie brown
,
"
( an elmore leonard adaption
)
, the stry is about a circle of 10 characters all after hte lottery money that has been won illegally
. thge screenplay doens a fine job infact balancing the charactors
and slowly revealing their motivations
and hidden agendas while at the smae timne keep russ richards the main focus
. more
and more characters are introduced
annd since the film has such an iconic
, cartoony atmosphere you can tkae onthe faith just what makes tje minor charactors dont what they do
. the ending itself is great
. it ' s surprising
and funny
and makes you feel good
. you relize this film has packed in about 10 different movies ' worth of stories into two hours ' time
and didn ' t fall apart
(
although many otehr criticists might beg to differ
)
. i liked it
,
and i could see it again
- isn ' t thyat what makes a movei good
?
