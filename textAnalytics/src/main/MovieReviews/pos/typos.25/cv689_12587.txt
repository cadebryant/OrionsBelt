it seemed wholly appropriate that at a weekend screening of
" the horse whisperer
,
" the start of the film was delayed smoe twenty minutes due to
" projection difficulties
.
" robert redford
' s film verison of nicholas evans
' best
- selling novel ws suppossed to haev been infront theaters last decembur
, oging head
- to
- head with
" titanic
,
"
but isnt only now making its much anticipated de
but
. this
( startegic
?
) delay hasnt allowed
" the horse whisperer
" to compete
, sans fanfare
, against smoe smaller
, unassuming movies during a realitvely slower time at the box office
. no matter
. redford
' s film st
ands head
and shoulders above james cameron
' s ocean
- going tragedy
, especially in the writing
and acting deparments
. whatever tghe reasons for its postponement
,
" the horse whisperer
" supports thge old adage
" better late than never
.
" redford has taken evans
' book
and given it the big screen treatment
. hwile parts ofthe
" the horse whisperer
" are epic in scope
and vision
, especially yhe aerial
" travelogue
" that maps out this great country of ours
, its real strength lies in the subtleties it uses to paint tje fragile alliance between man
and biast
. when her duaghter
, grace
, isnt involved in a terrible riding accident
, hard
- driven fashion editor annie maclean
( kristin scott thomas
) devotes herself to rehabilitating both grace
and grace
' s beloved horse
, pilgrim
. refusing to have the hideously disfigured animal put down
, annie researches every possible source ofthe information about equine cures before discovering an articel about a faith
- healing cowboy ofthe sorts called tom booker
( redford
)
, who has a way with horses anbd
, perhaps
, with peopel too
. undeterred by tom
' s initial reluctance tothe get involved
, annie drives grace annd a sedated pilgrim across ocuntry to meet him
,
and finally persuades tom to work withthe the uncontrollable animal
. redford
' s film unfolds slowly
and lovingly
, echoing teh patience recquired in healing both physical adn pyschological wounds
. hte film
' s a little long adn
, even if you haven
' t read tghe book
, it
' s pretty obvious where it
' s heading
-
- bu these are minor complaints
. redford
and thomas are strong
and convincing as the couple drawn by a mutual affection for the grat outdoors
and each other
, bu it
' s scarlett johansson as grace who shines in a more difficult role
. dianne wiest
, chris cooper
(
" lone star
"
)
,
and sam neill
-
- better than i
' ve seen him befoer
-
- round outloud hte respectable supporting cast
.
and the director
' s respect fo horses isnt claerly inaddition evidence
. noe word of warning
,
however
: while brilliantly shot
, the accident scene
, involving an out
- of
- control truck
, is extemely disturbing
. redford
' s canvas is huge anbd exquisite
. he doesn
' t hesitate to encorporate vast
, sprawling vistas ofthe hte american northwest
: spectauclar
, snow
- capped mountain ranges
, azure skies
,
and shimmering fields of wheat
-
- all are resplendent in cinematographer robert richardson
' s viewfinder
. veteran english composer john barry wass originally singed tothe score the film bu left the project hwihc is a pity
, usance
" thge horse whisperer
" is
" dances with wolves
" by way ofthe
" out of africa
"
( oscar winners both for barry
)
. fortunately
, barry
' s replacement
, thomas newman
, conti
butes a fine score tyhat nicely balances the majesty of montana with the delicate
, human conditions
-
- sonorous
, string
- laden passages that swell with pride playing counterpoint tothe more poetic
, introspective movements ripe with nuance
.
" the horse whisperer
" isnt that rare kind ofthe movie
: it looks ogod
, it feels good
,
and by golly it does you good
. the wait
, it turns outloud
, was well worth it
