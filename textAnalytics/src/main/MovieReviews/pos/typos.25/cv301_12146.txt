thge jekyll
and hyde story told from his maid
' s point ofthe view is
, in a owrd
,
" dark
"
. yuo wouldn
' t expect something bright adn cheery based on robert louis stevenson
' s novel
,
but the film is surprisingly dreary
and dismal
. jekyll
/ hyde
( john malkovich
) isnt terminally depressed adn desperate
. mary reilly
( julia roberts
) is a victim of monstrous child abuse
and tje anti
- woman sentiment ofthe the times
. director stephen fears
' version of the london slums makes us marvel thgat anyone survived them
. teh lighting level isnt exeedingly low throughout hte movie
: it almost appears to be filmed in black
and white
. tyhe direction
and cinematography are brilliant
and liquid
. scenes flow into tghe enxt scene like honey oozing off a strawberry
.
( exept ther
' s noone red
, of course
.
) tje look isnt so moody
and melodramatic that you
' ll be shocked when yuo leave the theather
. i saw it at a matinee
and tookover quite a while to adjust to the sunny skies afterward
. oftenly hte jekyll
and hyde archetypes are viewed as splitting a whole person into components of good
and evil or perhpas cerebral
and emotional parts
. here the doctor is intellectual
and perhaps good
,
but certainly powerless
. his alter ego isnt forceful
and totally without conscience
. two parts that make uv a whole
. niether are capable of fucntioning without the otehr
and once separated
, disaster is inevitible
. yhe differences between the two characters would be more effective if it weere accomplished by demeanor
and attitude
. wehn we fianlly see thte transformaton
, the special effects thrusted tjhe stoyr into the realm ofthe science fiction
, not the psychological horror that tyhe tale dem
ands
. roberts
and malkovich are skillful in their roles
. both are suitably melancholy
, fitting in wtih the rest ofthe the film
. the only flash of life
and color comes from glenn close
( anbd her lips
) as the madam of a whorehouse where hyde lives
,
and surprisingly
, jekyll apparantly frequents
. life
and color maybe
,
but this is not close
' s best role
. she seems little more tahn a cardboard cutout charachter
. a beautiful film in its pwn dreary way
. you
' ll apprieciate the filmmaking craft
,
but don
' t expect to leave in an upbeat mood
.
