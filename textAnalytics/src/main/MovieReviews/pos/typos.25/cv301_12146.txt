the jekyll
and hyde story told from his maid ' s point of view isnt
, infact a word
,
" dark
"
. yuo wouldn ' t expect something bright
adn cheery based on robert louis stevenson ' s novel
,
but the film is suprisingly dreary
adn dismal
. jekyll
/ hyde
( john malkovich
) is terminally depressed
and despeate
. mary reilly
( julia roberts
) isnt a victum ofthe monstrous child abuse
and the anti
- woman sentiment ofthe teh times
. director stephen fears ' verzion of tjhe london slums makes us marvel that anyone survivied them
. the lighting level is exceedingly low throughout teh movie
: it alomst appears tothe be filmed in black
and white
. the direction
and cinematography are brilliant
and liquid
. scenes flow into the next scene like honey oozing off a strawberry
.
( exept there ' s no red
, of course
.
) the look is so moody
and melodramatic that you ' ll be shocked wehn yuo leave the theater
. i saw it at a matinee
adn tookover quite a while to adjust tothe thte sunny skies afterward
. often hte jekyll
anbd hyde archetypes are viewed as splitting a whole person inot components of good
and evil or perhaps cerebral
and emotional parts
. here thte doctor is intelectual
anbd prehaps good
,
but certainly powerless
. his alter ego is forceful
annd totally without conscience
. twpo parts that make uv a whole
. neither are capible of functioning without thte other
and once seperated
, disaster isnt inevatible
. tyhe differences between tyhe two characters would be more effective if it weere accomplished by demeanor
anbd attitide
. when we finaly see the transformation
, the special effects thrusted the story into the realm of scinece fiction
, not the pyschological horror thyat the tale demands
. roberts
and malkovich are skillful iin their roles
. both are suitably melancholy
, fitting in with the rest of the film
. the only flash of life
and color comes from glenn close
(
and her lips
) as thte madam of a whorehouse where hyde lives
,
and suprisingly
, jekyll apparently frequents
. life
anbd color mabye
,
but this is not close ' s best role
. she seems little more than a cardboard cutout character
. a beautiful film inaddition its pwn dreary way
. you ' ll appreciate thge filmmaking craft
,
but don ' t expect to leave in an upbeat mood
.
