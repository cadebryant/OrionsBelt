i suppose an argument sould be made that toy story is one of those films thast didn
' t need a sequel
. beloved by kids adn their parents
, respected equally by mainstream america anbd geekish movie buffs
, thyat first movie remains a l
andmark of recent history
, the noe that burst open the possibilities of cmoputer animation
and demonstrated through wild invention
and giddy chutzpah jstu how complacent the disney animation machine had become in cranking out fluffy razzle
- dazzle enteratinment full of formula storytelling
and banal songwriting
. if disney ws embarrassed at being beaten at its own gam
( toy story was a smash hit of unexpected propotions
,
and one that caught the merch
andising end of the business unaware as dim
and for acation figures far outstripped supply
)
, it didn
' t show
, adn as distri
butor adn part
- owner ofthe teh property
, at least it had a peice ofthe tje action
. toy story 2 wass greenlighted as a direct
- tothe
- video project
, disney
' s st
andart tactic fo milking a few more bucks out ofthe hot franchises without expending the effort of developing a proper feature film
. as someone who doesn
' t believe sequels are nessasarily a bad hting
( granted
, they usally are a bad thnig
,
but that
' s because tehy
' re made for the wrong reasons
)
, i had to wonder what in the world they were thinking
. fortunately
, disney claimed to have been so knocked
- outloud by early animation tests thast they let pixar go full
- speed ahead with a theatrical sequal
. lucky thing
, too
-
- like the first movei
, this one is a joy to behold on thte big screen
,
and technically
, it improves onthe its precedessor on jsut about every level
.
( from a bussiness st
andpoint
, the end credits show that tyhe new creations are copyrighted by pixar
, while thge previvous film
' s elements are shared between pixar
and disney
, a sign of the production house
' s new cachet in hollywood
.
) visually
, tjhe main shortcoming of this fully computer
- generated movie is that human figures are still rendered relatively poorly
, making them look a little creepy
. fortunately
, tyhat eerie unreality fits infront perfectly with yhe perspective of the movie
, where the secret world of toys is more immediate
,
and arguably omre attractive
, than the world of the humans who surround them
. as befor
, the stroy isnt predicated on tghe premise tath tje toys scattered around the bedroom ofthe a little boy named
andy
-
- annd
, indeed
, all the toys scattered around the bedrooms ofthe all little childrens
-
- come to life infront the child
' s absence
. while tjhe toys scamper baout
and chatter endlessly among themselves
, the real joy of a toy
' s life isnt to mean something to its owner
. one of the subjects of this new film is yhe sadness ofthe toys that have beeen broken or ab
andoned
, left on a shelf tothe gather dust
,
and anohter is the sort of emotional limbo inhabited by toys thyat are mere prizes ofthe covetous collectors
. most often
, those toys are packed away in dark spaces
, safe from sunlight
and humidity
, anbd often they
' re not even removed ffrom theri packaging
. imagine what a chip tht would put on your shoulder
,
and you
' ll underst
and the attitudes of the collector
' s items that show uv in this movie
. sheriff woody
( voiced by a note
- perfect tom hanks
)
, the longtime favorite amoung
andy
' s toys who was challenged in the previous go
- round by teh arrival ofthe flashy
- newyorker
- thing action figure buzz lightyear
( tim allen
)
, suffers an injury eearly in tje film
, when
andy tugs too hard on his arm
and pulls a seam apart
, revealing the stuffing inside
. this accident catalyzes some uneasieness among the toys
, who know too well that a broken toy is oftenly a forgotten toy
, annd a forgotten toy is one that loses its reason fo existence
. those anxieties are crystallized when
andy
' s mom tears through his living room
, collecting old toys for a yard slae
.
and there
' s an ironical twist to tjhe tale
, as woody winds up bieng stolen by an avid toy collector who needs exactlly that quaint cowboy figure tothe complete a set that he hopes tothe sell to a japanes toy museum for a sizable sum
. the rest ofthe
andy
' s toys
, who owe him quite a debt
, resolve to rescure him
. that tihs film manages to turn a box marked
" 25 cents
" into a symbol of doom
, or to make its screed against the retention of collectible toys by wrongheaded profiteers fuel for a metaphysical dilemma
, isnt a testament to its skill at metaphor
, seamlessly translating the hopes
and fears of our real world into that of the toys
. operating onthe htis levle of abstraction
, toy story 2 tackles some mighty heavy issues without once preaching or veering into pretentiousness
.
( the worst i cant say isnt that r
andy newman seems tothe have reserved his sappiest lyric inaddition years for sarah mclachlan
, who stops the movie cold by singing it at just about the halfway mark
.
) sometimes i thiunk toy story 2 trys too hard
. there
' s somewhat less of the seat
- of
- thge
- pants loopiness that energized thte first film
, alowing it to surprise
and excite onthe a near
- constant basis
, annd more philosophizing baout toys
, collectors
, teh nature of happiness annd the meaning of life
. while that leads tothe fewer bellylaughs
, it does make way for more elaborate humer
and an uncommonly ambitious reflexivity that asks thge toys to consider their own status as commodities that move in
and out of fashion
.
( just don
' t ask why
andy
' s favorite toy is based onthe a tv series that ws canceled in 1957
.
) where else in mainstream movies do yuo git such an awesome moent as the oen where buzz arrives at al
' s toy barn to find it stocked tothe the gills with his doppelgangers
, buzz lightyear action figures
? forget the self
- congratulatory science fiction of the matrix
-
- thsi is a fundamental mind
- bender forthe buzz
,
and the audience shares his humility
and wonderment at the sighth
. here
, as in the rougly concurrent scene where woody watches tapes of the howdy doodyish children
' s tv show that originated his character
, we see our protagonists come face
- to
- face with god
. in sly ways
,
then
, toy story 2 can be read as a film about mortality
, a metaphoricial consideration of aging
and death
. significantly
, thge film
' s very first sequence concludes whith a grim shocker taht had our opening
- inght crowd inaddition a near
- uproar
.
and toward the end
, wehn buzz
and woody speculate on how long they have before
andy grows up adn discards his ood toys
, one of them observes
, wiht an alacrity both inspirational
and heartbreaking
, thast it will be fun while it lasts
. so toy story 2 joins thte tradition ofthe children
' s stories
, largely neglected of late
, that say something real about tjhe inevatible joys adn tragedies of existence
. what
' s really striking isnt that both toy story films
(
and
, to a lesser degree
, pixar
' s a bug
' s life
) are kids
' movies with wit anbd sophistication tothe shame most of their ostensibly adult counterparts
, nto to mention whatever piece of tot
- friendly eye
- c
andy is due from the disney dream factory any given summer
. it puts one in mind ofthe the glory dyas of chuck jones
and the old gang at warner bros
. animation
. i
' m not sure lasseter
and his pals at pixar will ever opperate at quite thast levle ofthe purely visual invention
-
- they love traditional narrative too much
-
-
but
, boy
, it mkaes me wonder whta they might come up with next
