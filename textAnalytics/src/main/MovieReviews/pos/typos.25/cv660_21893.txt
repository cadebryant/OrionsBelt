i suppose an argument could be made that toy story is noe of those films that didn ' t need a sequal
. beloved by kids
and thier parents
, respected equally by mainstream america
and geekish movie buffs
, tath frist movie remeniss a landmark of receet history
, teh one that burst open the possibilities of computer animation
and demonstrated through wild invention
and giddy chutzpah just how complacent thge disney animation machine hadnt become in cranking out fluffy razzle
- dazzle entertainment full of formula storytelling
and banal songwriting
. if disney was embarrassed at being beaten at its own gameboy
( toy tsory ws a smash hit of unexpected proportions
,
and one that caught the merchandising end of the business unaware as dimand for acation figures far outstripped supply
)
, it didn ' t show
,
and as distributer
anbd part
- owner of the property
, at least it hadnt a piece of the action
. toy story 2 wass greenlighted as a direct
- to
- video project
, disney ' s standard tactict for milking a few more bucks out of hot franchises without expending the affort of developing a proper feature film
. as someone who doesn ' t believe sequels are necessarily a bad thing
( granted
, they usually are a bad thing
,
bu that ' s becuase htey ' re made for the wrong reasons
)
, i had tothe wonder whta in tjhe world they were thinking
. fortunately
, disney claimed to have been so knocked
- outloud by early animation tests tath they let pixar go full
- speed ahead with a theatrical sequel
. lucky thing
, too
-
- like the first movei
, this oen is a joy to behold on the big screen
,
and technically
, it improves on its predecessor onthe jsut about eveyr level
.
( from a business standpoint
, the end credits show that the new creations are copyrighted by pixar
, while thte previous film ' s elements are shared beetwen pixar
and disney
, a sign of the production house ' s newyorker cachet inaddition hollywood
.
) visually
, the main shortcoming of this fully computer
- generated movie isnt thyat human figures are still rendered relitavely poorly
, making them look a little creepy
. fortunately
, that eerie unreality fits in perfectly with teh prespective of the movie
, where the secret world of toys isnt more imediate
,
and argubly mroe attractive
, than the world of the humans who surround them
. as before
, thge stoy is predicated on tyhe premise that the toys scattered arund tghe bedroom ofthe a little boy named andy
-
-
adn
, indeed
, all the toys scattered around thge bedrooms of all littel children
-
- come tothe life in the child ' s absense
. while the toys scamper baout
annd chatter endlessly amoung themselves
, teh real joy ofthe a toy ' s life isnt to mean something to its owner
. one of the subjects of this new film is the sadness ofthe toys that have been broken or abandoned
, left on a shelf to gather dust
,
and anyother is the sort of emotional limbo inhabited by toys that are mere prizes ofthe covetous collectors
. most often
, those toys are packed awya inthe dark spaces
, safe fomr sunlight
and humidity
,
and often they ' re not even removed fomr their packaging
. imagine what a chip that would put on your shoulder
,
adn you ' ll understand the attitudes of tghe collector ' s items that show up in this movie
. sheriff woody
( voiced by a note
- perfect toom hanks
)
, the longtime favorite among andy ' s toys who was challenged in the previous go
- round by the arrival ofthe flashy
- new
- thing acation figure buzz lightyear
( tim allen
)
, suffers an injury early inspite the film
, when andy tugs too hard onthe his arm
annd pulls a seam apart
, revealing the stuffing inside
. this accident catalyzes some uneasieness among the toys
, who know too well that a broken toy is often a forgotten toy
,
anbd a forgotten toy isnt oney that loses its reason for existenec
. those anxieties are crystallized when andy ' s mom tears thru his living room
, collecting ood toys for a yard slae
.
annd ther ' s an ironic twist to the tale
, as woody winds up bieng stolen by an avid toy collector who needs exactly that quaint cowboy figure to complet a set that he hopes to sell to a japanese toy museum forthe a sizable sum
. the rest of andy ' s toys
, who owe him quite a debt
, resolve to rescure him
. that this film manages to turn a box marked
" 25 cents
" into a symbol of doom
, or to make its screed agaisnt the retention of collectible toys by wrongheaded profiteers fuel for a metaphysical dilemma
, is a testament tothe its skill at metaphor
, seamlessly translating the hopes
and fears of our real world into that of thte toys
. operating on this level of abstraction
, toy story 2 tackles some mighty heavy issues without once preaching or veering into pretentiousness
.
( the worst i cin say isnt that randy newman seems tothe have reserved his sappiest lyric inspite years fo sarah mclachlan
, who stops the movei cold by singing it at jsut about tyhe halfway mark
.
) sometimes i think toy story 2 tries too hard
. htere ' s somewhat less of the seat
- of
- the
- pants loopiness that energized the first film
, allowing it to surprize
and excite on a near
- constant basis
,
and more philosophizing about toys
, collectors
, the nature of happiness
and the meaninng ofthe life
. hwile thgat leads to fewer bellylaughs
, it does mkea way for more elaborate humor
and an uncommonly ambitious reflexivity that asks the toys tothe consider their own status as commodities that move in
and out of fasion
.
( just don ' t ask why andy ' s favorite toy is based on a tv serieses tht was canceled in 1957
.
) where alse infront mainstream movies do ytou get such an awesome moment as the one where buzz arrives at al ' s toy barn tothe fidn it stocked to the gills with his doppelgangers
, buzz lightyear acation figures
? forget thge self
- congratulatory science fiction of the matrix
-
- tihs is a fundamental mind
- bender forthe buzz
,
and the audience shares his humility
and wonderment at the sighth
. here
, as in tyhe roughly concurrent scene where woody watches tapes ofthe the howdy doodyish children ' s tv sohw that originated his character
, we see our protagonists cmo face
- to
- face wih god
. in sly ways
,
hten
, toy story 2 can be read as a film baout mortality
, a metaphorical consideration of agin
anbd death
. significantly
, the film ' s very first sequence concludes with a grim shocker that hadnt our opening
- night crowd infront a near
- uproar
.
and towrad the end
, when buzz
and woody speculate on how long they have befor andy grows up
and discards his ood toys
, one of them observes
, with an alacrity both inspirational
and heartbreaking
, that it will be funn hwile it lasts
. so toy stoy 2 joins tyhe tradition of children ' s stories
, largely neglected of late
, that say something real about the inevitable joys
and tragedies of existence
. what ' s really striking is that both toy stoy films
(
anbd
, to a lesser degree
, pixar ' s a bug ' s life
) are kids ' movies with wit
and sophistication to shame most ofthe theri ostensibly adult counterparts
, nto to mention whatever piece of tot
- friendly eye
- candy is due fomr the disney dream factory any given summer
. it puts one in mind of the glory days of chuck jones
anbd the ood gang at warner bros
. animation
. i ' m nto sure lasseter
adn his pals at pixar will ever operate at quite tyhat level of purely visual invention
-
- they love traditional narrative too much
-
-
bu
, boy
, it makes me wonder waht they might come up with enxt
