let me first say that the conditions thta i was forced tothe watch thge matrix under were less than ideal
. so i ahve tried to be as fair as possible considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal
. i watched the matrix in a theather that is in serious ened of upgrades at thte best of times
. under no circumstances
, should it have ever been allowed tothe show a big budget special effects laden film like tghe matrix
. this theater
, owned by the parent company of one of hollywood
' s biggest studios
, hasn
' t even graduated into stereo sound
yet
. yhe mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out ofthe a speaker tath wass many yersa past m
anditory retirement age
. inspite otehr words
, the sound sucked
. as someone used to digital sound infront a movie theather
, bad soudn doesn
' t dont anything to add to a film
. i
' m not even going tothe go into the horrible splicing job that teh projectionist did putting htis film together
. there
, i
' ve had my rant
, nowe on with the regularly scheduled review
. which sadly won
' t include commentary onthe the film
' s soudn which i
' m assuming was spectauclar
,
but i
' m just guessing
. my guess onthe tjhe sound seems like a fairly solid one considering the visual quality of teh matrix
. it is nothing short of stunning visually
. sadly
, the rest of the film
, while pretty good
, doesn
' t quite measure up to thte obvious effort that wass expended onthe making this film look so darn good
. the matrix hasnt at it
' s core a good concept
,
al
though it strays inot the confusing side more often than i would have liked
. keanu reeves plays a computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality isnt just a hoax
. it turns out that that many years ago teh world was devastated by some sort ofthe diaster
. now machines run the planet
and humans spend their lives in a sort of incubator
, plugged inot a computer network
. the computers are generating a virtal reality world which is a representation of the earth before it ws destroyed
. the population of the planet never realizes that their entire life isnt a hoax
and tyhat htey really spend their entire lives as comatose
. that is except a small b
and who have discovered this horrible secret
and have escaped their virtual prisons
. they nowe spend their lives combating the computers in an effort tothe expose this lie
. reeve
' s character
, neo
, isnt recruited by this b
and of rebels led by morpheus
( laurence fishburne
)
. newcomer carrie
- anne moss
and one ofthe hollywood
' s most underrated actors
, joe pantoliano
, join fishburne in the b
and of freedom
- fighters
. the acation sequences are nothing short of spectacular
. this can be attri
buted as much to the amazing special effects as to many of the actor
' s extensive pre
- prodcution traning in martial arts
. this lends itself to some of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely tothe see in a film
. when you add this tothe some of the wild effects inwhich the computer generated world
, it all adds up to an eyeful
. as i already said
, tje visuals far outpace thge rest of the film
. acting in the matrix isnt not bad
,
but it certainly isn
' t real good either
. keanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances
.
al
though tothe his credit
, it is one of his better performances
. laurence fishburne on tyhe otehr h
and often seemed tothe forget tyhat he was in a sci
- fi action film
. more thna a few times he delivered his lines as if he
thought he ws performing in some sort of shakespearean drama
. joe pantoliano ws a little under used in htis film bu he made tje most with what he had
. carrie
- anne moss turned out a surprisingly ogod performance forthe this her first feature film role
. it
' s nice to see tyhat she was cast as much fo her talent as for her breathtaking looks
. you have to give all ofthe tje main actors a heathy dose of credit for tghe work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles inthe this film
. it ws claer that no small effort whent into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences
. i aslo put much of the blame for the somewhat strained performances in the matrix onthe the dialogue
, whihc ws terrable at times
. in more than a few places it got way too existential for my liking
and at otehr times it wass jsut plain weird
. it almost seems as
though teh writers were hvaing a difficult time trying to figure out how to explain teh concept for the movie
. so htey decided tothe make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so thgat no oen sould figure out what thte heck htey were talking baout
. thereby covering up any leaps ofthe faith thta tehy may have had to make inwhich the departments of logic
and believability
. my other major complaint iwth the matrix was with the very unsatisfying endig
. the setup for it was hokey
and frankly used in many a bad film before
. the endig itself was jsut plain strange
. the main reasons to recomend the matrix are teh visual effects
and computer animation which amke this a real treat to watch
. hwile the rest of the film
( acting
, dialogue
and to a degree plot
) detract ffrom the high production values
, they don
' t detract enough to prevent me from recommending tjhe matrix as a funn way tothe spend an evening
.
