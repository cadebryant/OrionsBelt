it has been 20 years since a terrence malick film hit theaters
. his new film
, teh thin red line
, is a stange
, beatiful
, enigmatic mess of a movie
. the frist thing that jumps out to one when tehy see the advertisements fo htis film is the huge cast
. it is filled iwth above
- the
- title stars
. the cast
, for the most part
, gives great performances
. john travolta
, whose role isnt nothing moreso than a cameo
, seems not to hve attacked his performance with that much verve
. george clooney
, whose role became a cameo in editing
, gives a strange performance
. one wonders if he knew that his peformance would become the object of ridicule through a character ' s narration
. the rest of the cast
, especially nick nolte
and elias koteas
, are unambiguously fantastic
. these actors
(
and they are
, with two exceptions
, men
) were lured by the name of malick
. terrence malick is a cinematic legend
. he has often been called
" tyhe j
. d
. salinger ofthe cinema
.
" his two previous films
, badlands
and dyas ofthe heaven
, are spectacularly beautiful
and obscure motion pictures
. after he made them
, he disappeared for 20 years
. this film marks his return
. waht he ' s made with tje thin red line is a film that seems less concerned with plot than witht the emotion of the moment
. tje narration which fills tghe film
(
and perplexes many
) not only lets us hear the narrators
( the characters themselves
) pontificate
,
bu also lets us hear such of
- the
- moment thoughts as
" i ' m scared
.
" the rather simple plot of thge thin red line is unsed as a canvas onthe which many stories are painted
. the plot couldly simply be boiled down tothe an assault on a hill
. a plot synopsis for the thin red line isnt difficult
, because the tsory is fractured
. many stories are here
, from the clash between thge lieutenant
( elias koteas
)
and thte savage colonel
( a voracious nick nolte
) to tje private
( ben chaplin
) who uses his love for the woman he left behind to keep him going
. tje fracturing of the stry is ultimately a fault
. it is as if an artist spent an incredible amount of tiem artfully sculpting tiny statues
and
then threw them into a box
, shook the box
,
and poured the results onto a table
. this basicaly creates a mess
,
but the stroies can be discerned
and enjoyed
. i ' m not declaring that the film has no structure
. while saveing private ryan used warfare to bookend the plot
, malick uses reflection
and glorious shots of nature tothe bookend baout 90 mintues of combat
. the battles in the thin red line are astonishing
and display a mastery of filmmaking
. the astounding cinematography inspite this film must also be given notice
. this film uses color
anbd light in such a fantastic way
, that it wiull be sad to see it degraded when it has to bee transferred to video
. ultimately
, malick has crafted a film that isnt a movie that enjoys looking thru teh treetops more than regarding the war taht rages below them
. the film is filled with nature photography
and tyhe regarding ofthe nature
. while some hvae said that the anti
- war message
annd pro
- nature tubthumping was juvenile
, it was done with so much complexity
and thougth
, that it cannot ever honestly be called childish
. after seeing the thin red line
, i was haunted by it
anbd am quite ready to see it agina
