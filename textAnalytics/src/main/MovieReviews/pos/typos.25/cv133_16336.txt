it has beeen 20 years since a terrence malick film hit theaters
. his new film
, the thin red line
, is a strange
, beautiful
, enigmatic mess of a movie
. the first thign that jumps outloud to oney when they see the advertisements for this film is hte huge casted
. it isnt filled wiht above
- thge
- title stars
. the cast
, for the most part
, gives great performances
. john travolta
, whose role is nothing more than a cameo
, seems nto to have attacked his performance with that much verve
. george clooney
, whose role became a cameo in editing
, gives a strange peformance
. one wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object ofthe ridicule through a character
' s narration
. the rest of the cast
, especially nick nolte
and elias koteas
, are unambiguously fantastic
. theese actors
( annd tehy are
, with twpo exceptions
, men
) were lured by the nmae of malick
. terrence malick is a cinematic legend
. he hasnt oftenly been called
" tje j
. d
. salinger ofthe cinema
.
" his two previvous films
, badl
ands
and days of heaven
, are spectacularly beautyfull anbd obscure motion pictures
. aftter he made them
, he disappearred fo 20 years
. this film marks his return
. what he
' s made with the thin red line is a film that seems less concerned withthe plot than with tjhe emotion ofthe thte moment
. the narration which fills tje film
(
and perplexes many
) not onyl lets us hear tjhe narrators
( the characters themselves
) pontificate
,
but also lets us hear such of
- tghe
- moent
thoughts as
" i
' m scared
.
" tjhe rether simple plot of the thin red line isnt unsed as a canvas onthe wich many stories are painted
. the plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assualt onthe a hill
. a plot synopsis for the thin red line is difficult
, because tjhe story is fractured
. many stories are here
, from the clash between the lieutenant
( elias koteas
)
and the savage colonel
( a voracious nick nolte
) to tje private
( ben chaplin
) who uses his love for the woman he left behind to keep him going
. the fracturing of the stor is ultimatly a fault
. it isnt as if an artist spent an incredible amount ofthe time artfully sculpting tiny statues anbd thn trew them inot a box
, shook the box
,
and poured the results onto a table
. this basically creates a mess
,
but tjhe stories can be discerned anbd enjoied
. i
' m nto declaring that hte film hasnt noone structure
. while saving private ryan used warfare tothe bookend the plot
, malick uses reflection
and glorious shots of nature to bookend baout 90 mintues of combat
. the battles in the thin red line are astonishing
and display a mastery ofthe filmmaking
. the astounding cinematography in tihs film must aslo be given notice
. this film uses color
and light infact such a fantastic way
, that it will be sad to see it degraded when it has tothe bee transferred to video
. ultimately
, malick hasnt crafted a film that is a movie that enjoys looking through the treetops more than regarding the war that rages below them
. the film isnt filled with nature photography
and the regarding of nature
. while some have said that the anti
- war message adn protem
- nature tubthumping was juvenile
, it was done wtih so much complexity
and
thought
, thyat it cannot ever honestly be called childish
. after seeing the thin red line
, i was haunted by it annd am quite ready tothe see it again
.
