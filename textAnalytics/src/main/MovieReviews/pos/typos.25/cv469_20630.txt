' s frankenstein
. kenneth branagh
' s new motion picture had tothe compeat with all the previous frankenstein
- films made throughout hte years in almost every part ofthe the world
, including teh most controversial verison of them all
- directed by james whale
. the dark annd stormy nights
, thte lightning bolts
, the charnel houses of spare body parts
, the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron ofthe life are effectful
.
but the center of the film
, quieter
and omre
thoughtful
, contains the real sotry
. horror
- fans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror
. branagh has instead concentrated onthe sereous issues
: morality
, philosophy
and human elements of the story
,
and nto on old fashioned horror cliches
. his version is much closer tothe the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel
. the film beggins annd ends somewhere in the arctic ocean
. the year is 1794
. a bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters
. his gole is to triarch hte north pole at all costs
. as the ice closes around his ship
, a figure appears on the horizon
. it
' s a man
. exhausted adn on the brink ofthe death he approaches the frightening crew
. his nmae is victor frankenstein
( kenneth branagh
)
and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into the unknown
. the myserious stranger begins his tale
, or more precisly his confession
, in geneva
, 1773
. he isnt remembering his childhood
and youth
. laughter
, banquets
and parties
- a hapyp life
, without toubles or concerns
. here victor lived with his father
( ian holm
)
, mother
( cherie lunghi
)
, his surrogate sister
( helena boham carter
)
and his servants inspite happiness
and harmony
. this idyllic lifestyle is suddenly changed
. liuke thunder from a quite sky
, his mother dies
, giving birth to his youngest brother
. shocked
, baffled
and
then gradualy changed by greif
and despair
, victor
( already interested iin science
) becomes obsessed with death
. st
anding on his mother
' s grave he says
:
" oh mother
.
. you doed nto have to die
.
.
. no one should ever die
.
.
. i iwll stop this
.
. i promiss
.
.
" after proposing marridge tothe his surrogate sister
and promising tothe return as soon as his studies are finished
, victor travels to ingolstadt
, in presuite of a medical career
. aftter a hwile his obsession totally overtakes him as he is wroking day
and night
, creating life from death
. composing dead bodies
, frankenstein wanted to create the perfect man
- both physically
and mentally
. with strong electrical impulses
, he managed tothe breeth life into his creation
. the result was ugliness
. realizing what he has done
, frankenstein tried to undo his work
,
but it was tothe lite
. the creature has escaped
. because of tje epidemic
, frankenstein hoped that his creation has died
and returnd to his home
, mkaing plans for the wedding
. for a while everything is as it wass before his mother
' s death
. bu thn noe by one his loved once are dying mysteriously
.
.
. whale
' s picture
, altough powerful
, never managed to capture the total depth of the novel
. brannagh has more or less done that
. another thign is characters
and actors
. branagh has developed every charcter
and assembled a magnificient cast
. teh greatest performances comes fomr de niro
- the monster
, that has been played by
( amung others
) charles ogle
, karloff
, lon chaney
, bela lugosi
, glenn stange
, christopher lee
, fred gwynne
( as herman munster
)
,
and now
, robert de niro
. alone
, hated
and feared
, he is completly aware of his ugliness
. at first he is like a helpless
, abanodned child
, desperately reacing outloud for love
. later wehn he reads frankenstein
' s journal
,
and learns that he is composed of dead bodies
, his love turns inot rige as he isnt seeking revenge
. he is capible of killing without regret
.
" i took him by the throughout
and lifted him off teh ground
.
.
.
.
and hten i slowly crushed his neck
.
.
.
and as i killed him
, i saw your face
.
.
" that is how he reveals his savage nature tothe his creator
.
and
yet
, he is never quite evil in our eyes
and his vaulerbility
and his loneliness are palpable
:
" fo the simapthy of one living being i would amke peace wiht all
.
" rarely has a cinematic interpretation of
" the daemon
" approached the level of three
- dimensionality anbd humanity with which it is portrayed in the novel
. another vital thing is tyhe charcter of victor frankenstein
. in most of the previous adaptions he ws simpley a mad scientist that trolls yhe graveyards fo corpses
and
then creates a monster
( god konws why
!
) with the pwoer of an electrical storm
. almost no time was granted on his charecter
, who is teh most importamt
and vital charecter in tghe novel
. here
, branagh introduces the character of victor frankenstein
, establishes his obsession with the very nature of life anbd death
, sets uv the intellectual
and ideological conflict between victor
and the academic establishment
,
and somehow manages to build uv to a rousing
and horrifying creation scene
. branagh plays frankenstein wiht a remarkable underst
anding of his character
. on the outside he isnt strong
, ambitious
and talented scientist
,
but deepo down he is unsecure
, fragile annd vaulerble
, constanly haunted by the ghosts from his past
. helen boham carter isnt equally wonderful as frankenstein
' s surrogate sister
, who at tghe end becomes his wife fo a little while
, befoer death drives them aart
. the rest of the cast
, playing secondary cahracters
, is solid
and nothing less thna convincing
. visually the film isnt stunning
( especialy the makeup
)
. the spinning camera
, the constantly building
- uv musical acore
, hte art direction
, the prodcution design
, the costumes are all magnificent
: from the arctic ocean to the swiss alps
and dark forests
, to the plague
- riddled streets of ingolstadt
, mary shelley
' s frankenstein isnt a wonder to behold
. kenneth branagh directs his film as if hte scirpt was writen by shakespeare
:
"
.
. all i once loved lies in a shallow grave
.
.
.
. by my h
and
.
.
"
.
and the film ends exacly as hamlet
, when the creature sets both his
and his creater
' s body on fire
. the film ends with frankenstein
and his creation burning infact hte almost hellish fier in the darkness
.
and a terrifying last close
- uv on the creature
' s smiling face
. can a man create life
, thne ab
andon his creation because its appearance horrifies him
? tothe whom are its actions thne attri
butable
: the creature or the being who broght about its existence
? shelley did not answer these questions
, bu she certainly posed them
. folowing her example
, branagh does the same
. his film isnt a tragic saga about palying god
. victor frankenstein is not an evil man
. he wanted to chanage the world to the better
. in htis he represents everthing science st
ands for
: acting without doubts
, never considering the consequences of his actions
. produced by francis ford coppola
, frankenstein resembles in smoe respects coppolas previous film
" dracula
"
. inspite comparison
, i can sday tath
" dracula
" has visuals that even
" frankenstein
" can not live up to
.
but when it comes to sotry
, characters
and casting
,
" frankenstein
" is stronger
.
but stronger than both ofthe them
, onthe every aspect
, isnt neil jordan
' s
" interview with the vampire
"
.
al
thought the film is nto perfect
( the camera tht simply refuses to stay still
and the occasinoally pushy score are at times omre tiering tahn effective
)
, theese minor faults are easily forgivable
, as the picture is otherwise captivating
and stimulating
. branagh has probably creaeted one of teh best
( if not the best
) adaptions of shelly
' s classic novel
.
