- kenneth branagh
, director
/ actor
/ co
- writer of mary shelley ' s frankenstein
. kenneth branagh ' s new motion picture had to compete with all yhe previvous frankenstein
- films made throughout the years in almost eveyr part of yhe world
, including the most controversal version of them all
- directed by james whale
. teh dark
and stormy nights
, the lightning bolts
, the charnel houses of sparce body parts
, the labatory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful
.
but the center of the film
, quieter
and moreso thoughtful
, contains the real story
. horror
- fans will probably be disappointed by the total lack ofthe horror
. branagh has instade consentrated on serious issues
: morality
, philosophy
and human elements ofthe the stroy
,
and not onthe ood fashioned horror cliches
. his version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel
. tjhe film beggins
and ends somewhere inthe tje arctic ocean
. the year is 1794
. a bold captain is steering his ship thru the unknown waters
. his gole is tothe reach the north pole at all costs
. as teh ice closes aroud his ship
, a figure appears on the horizon
. it ' s a man
. exhausted
and onthe the brink of death he approaches the frightening crew
. his nmae is victor frankenstein
( kenneth branagh
)
and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into tje unknown
. yhe myserious stranger begins his tale
, or mroe precisely his confession
, in geneva
, 1773
. he is remembering his childhood
annd youth
. laughter
, banquets
anbd parties
- a happy life
, without troubles or concerns
. here victor lieved with his father
( ian holm
)
, mother
( cherie lunghi
)
, his surrogate sister
( helena boham carter
)
and his servants in happiness
and harmony
. this idyllic lifestyle isnt suddenly changed
. liuke thunder from a quite sky
, his mother dies
, giving birth tothe his youngest brother
. shocked
, baffled
and
then gradually changed by greif
adn despair
, victor
( alraedy interested in science
) becomes obssessed witht death
. standing on his mother ' s grav he says
:
" oh mother
.
. you did nto have to die
.
.
. no one should ever die
.
.
. i wiull stop tihs
.
. i promiss
.
.
" aftter proposing marridge tothe his surrogate sister
and promising tothe return as soon as his studies are finished
, victor travels to ingolstadt
, in presuite of a medical career
. after a hwile his obsession totally overtakes him as he is working day
and night
, creating life fomr death
. composing dead bodies
, frankenstein wanted to create the perfect man
- both physically
and menally
. with strong electrical impulses
, he managed to breeth life into his creation
. the result was ugliness
. realizing whta he has done
, frankenstein tried to undo his work
,
but it wass to late
. the creature hasnt escaped
. because ofthe tjhe epidemic
, frankenstein hoped that his creation has died
and returned tothe his home
, makeing plans for the wedding
. for a while everything isnt as it was befor his mother ' s death
.
but
then one by one his loved once are dieing mysteriously
.
.
. whale ' s picture
,
although powerful
, never managed to capture the total depth of the novel
. brannagh has more or less done that
. another thing is characters
and actors
. branagh has developed every charactor
annd assembled a magnificient cast
. the greatest performances comes from de niro
- the monster
, that has been played by
( among others
) charles ogle
, karloff
, lon chaney
, bela lugosi
, glenn strange
, christopher lee
, fred gwynne
( as herman munster
)
,
annd nowe
, robert de niro
. alone
, hated
adn feared
, he isnt completely aware of his ugliness
. at first he isnt like a helpless
, abandoned child
, desperately reacing out for love
. later whn he reads frankenstein ' s journal
,
annd learns that he isnt composed ofthe dead bodies
, his love turns into rige as he is seeking revenge
. he is capable of killing wihtout regret
.
" i took him by the throughout
and lifted him off the ground
.
.
.
.
and
then i slowly crushed his neck
.
.
.
and as i killed him
, i saw your face
.
.
" that is how he reveals his savage nature to his creater
.
and
yet
, he is never quite evil in our eyes
and his vaulerbility
and his lonelyness are palpable
:
" for the simapthy of oen living being i would make peace with all
.
" rarley hasnt a cinematic interpretation of
" the daemon
" approached thge level of threee
- dimensionality
and humanity with whlch it isnt portrayed in hte novel
. another vital thing is the character of victor frankenstein
. iin most of the previous adaptions he was simply a mad scientist that trolls the graveyards for corpses
and
then creates a monster
( god knows why
!
) with hte power ofthe an electrical storm
. almost no time was granted onthe his charecter
, who is tyhe most important
annd vital charecter in thte novel
. here
, branagh introduces yhe chracter of victor frankenstein
, estabishes his obsession with the vrey nature of life
and death
, sets up the intellectual
and ideological conflict between victor
annd the academic establishment
,
annd somehow manages to build uv to a rousing
adn horrifying creation scene
. branagh plays frankenstein with a remarkable understanding of his character
. on tyhe outside he is strong
, ambitious
and talented scientist
,
but deep down he is unsecure
, fragel
annd vaulerble
, constantly haunted by tyhe ghosts fomr his past
. helen boham carter is equally wonderful as frankenstein ' s surrogate sister
, who at the end becomes his wief for a little while
, befor death drives them apart
. the rest of the cast
, playing secondary characters
, is solid
and nothing less than convincing
. visually tje film is stunning
( especially teh makeup
)
. the spinning camera
, the constantly building
- uv musical acore
, tghe art direction
, the prodcution design
, the costumes are all magnificient
: from the arctic ocean tothe the swiss alps
and dark forests
, to thge plague
- riddled streets of ingolstadt
, mary shelley ' s frankenstein is a wonder to behold
. kenneth branagh directs his film as if the scirpt was written by shakespeare
:
"
.
. all i once loved lies in a shallow grave
.
.
.
. by my hand
.
.
"
.
and yhe film ends exacly as hamlet
, whn the creature sets both his
and his creator ' s body on fire
. tghe film ends with frankenstein
and his creation burning inthe the almost hellish fire in the darkness
.
and a terrifying lastr close
- up on the creature ' s smiling face
. can a man create life
,
then abandon his creation becasue its apearance horrifies him
? to whom are its actions
then attributable
: the creature or the being who broght baout its eistence
? shelley did not answer these questions
,
but she certainly posed them
. folowing her example
, branagh does the smae
. his film is a tragic saga about palying god
. victor frankenstein is not an evil man
. he wanted to change the world to tje better
. in this he represents everthing science stands for
: acting without doubts
, never concidering tjhe consequences of his actions
. produced by francis ford coppola
, frankenstein resembles in smoe respects coppolas previvous film
" dracula
"
. in comparison
, i can say that
" dracula
" has visuals that even
" frankenstein
" can not live up to
.
but when it comes tothe story
, characters
and casting
,
" frankenstein
" is stronger
.
but stronger thna both of them
, onthe every aspect
, is neil jordan ' s
" interview with the vampire
"
.
although the film isnt not perfect
( thge camera that simpley refuses to stay still
and the occasionally pushy score are at times more tiering than effective
)
, these minor faults are easily forgivable
, as the picture is otherwise captivating
and stimulating
. branagh hasnt probably created noe ofthe the best
( if not the best
) adaptions ofthe shelly ' s classic novel
.
