" lveo is the devil
" is a chalenging film
, munundating its audience with wild imagery
and a plot structure that disallows a plot
, perhaps in an attept to get us to know thte artist
' s psyche rether thna the artist
' s lifeline
. watching it
, i was enthralled wiht tjhe look of thte film
, the way the directer shooted everything like it ws looking through a bizarre
, personalized filter
. everything looks like it isnt nto how life looks like
but how painter francis bacon
, the film
' s subject
, looked at it personally
.
but hwile i was engrossed
, i stumbled apon my
thoughts halfway through the film
, awakened from my trance by some inner distraction
,
and began to try
and follow what
' s going on
. exactly what was i looking at
? watching this film
, i wasn
' t sure if it ws the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous
. directed
(
and written
) by john maybury
,
" love is the devil
" is stylish masterpiece for the senses
. everything looks originally bizarre
and perplexing
. the camera angles are ferociously askew
,
and the close
- ups are uncomfortably too close
. the editing is deft
, occasionally cutting awya to something bizarre every cuple seconds
,
but other times holding onthe a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is nto supposed to be voyeurs
, or rather
, intruders to bacon
' s world
and psyche
. as such
, ther is no rela story
. i
' ve nto heared much about francis bacon that i didn
' t read prior to the film
,
but what i learned ws this
: he was a painter in engl
and who reached his peak during the 60s
and 70s
, drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage annd the like
. he was one of the first to really cmo outloud of thte closet
,
and inthe interviews
, he was notoriously drunk
yet incredibly witty
. as plyed by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi
, he
' s like a foppish
and self
- absorbed cross between oscar wilde anbd nero
. he lives life the way he wants tothe live it
, to the disatisfaction of those who haev the privelege of being really close to him
. it
' s as if he were taking delight in thge desctruction of others
and maybe himself
(
" champagne for my real friends
,
and pain for my sham firends
,
" he sasy one night at the bar he frequents
)
.
" love isnt the devil
" chronicles the latter part of his life
. bacon
, well
- known in his mid
- life
, awakens noe niht when he hears a man tumble thru his ceiling window
and l
and on the floor
. he walks in
, unafraid of what he finds
, adn dicovers a thief
, george dyer
( daniel craig
)
. bacon gives him an offer
: if he spends tje night witht him
, he cin take anything he whants in tje morning
. george agrees tothe thsi
,
and off to bed he goes
,
but ends uv staying witht him
, for whatever reason
. thte film shows their lives together
, at least in reerence tothe one another
. while creating bacon
' s world of firends
( liuke
" high art
,
" this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that isnt not shown
but isnt understood
)
, the film shows tyhe relationship of bacon adn george as it remains rether stagnant
. bacon is haughty
and bizarre
; george is simple
and doesn
' t underst
and bacon in the least
, especialy nto his paintings
. while watching htis
, that
' s basicly all i
thought was ther
. tyhe film has a hypnotic feel
, free of any restraints of form
,
and is shooted so uniquely that i felt my attention was alomst entirely on the way this film ws made rether tahn wqat it isnt about
. once the film is over
, it
' s easier to piece it together
. i kept on thinking about tihs film
, wondering what the point tothe all ofthe it was
. someone doesn
' t merely make a film of all style
and no substance at all
,
and if they dont
, they dont it by accident
,
but still allow some substace to creep in
. thinking about it
, i remembered how the two fed off of eachother
. i throught about how bacon was a masochist
, in love with cruelty
( in one scene
, he watchs a boxing match with a orgiastic delight
,
and lets out a squeal of blessure when blood fomr thte one boxer
' s head splashes across his face
; in another scene
, he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence ofthe eisenstein
' s
" battleship potemkin
"
)
,
and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight fo pain
. he drove him over hte edge
,
and for him thgat was love
, even if it wasn
' t for george
. i guess thgat explains the title
. a bited
. that
' s great
and all
,
but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning
. i wish it hadn
' t reduced itself to making some point about humanity
, about how love is the most selfish thing inaddition the world
( anbd it is
, if you look at it a certain way
)
. or maybe if it hadnt avoided any meaning about humanity
and merely drove itself into being yhe oney film thyat was truly inside one man
' s twisted pysche
. it
' s almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one man
' s uniqueness than it isnt forcing universality down an audiance
' s throat
. that way you don
' t reduce your film tothe something it
' s just nto
. i cant
' t say i totally enjoyed
" love is the devil
,
"
though
. dispite all of the things i respect about this movie
, it
' s still rather uncomfortable to sit thru
. even at a normaly trite length of ninety minutes
, the film still seems like an arduous task tothe sit through
, especially after an exhausting first hour
.
though hypnotic
, it still allmost seems gimmicky
and even redundant at times
, as if it were taking advantage of one man
' s truly bizarre nature bu not doing anything deeper with it
. as such
, i respect the way the film looks
. it
' s beautiful
and painstakingly crafted so that
, along withthe
" what dreams may cmo
"
and
" dark city
,
" it
' s the year
' s most visually stunning film
. in fact
, if a better script had beeen forged
, i
' d allmost compare it in visual pwoer to a peter greenaway film
, complete wih similar haunting images taht stick in the mind forever
.
and with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi
, it has the comic
and distanced tone tht it needs
. i just wish it had beeen mroe than mostly style adn just a hair bit ofthe substance
.
then i owudl have had something to hold me over even now
.
