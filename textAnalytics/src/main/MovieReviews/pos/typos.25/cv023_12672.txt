when bulworth ended
, i allowed myself a sigh ofthe releaf
:
? it is possible for me to enjoy political satire
.
? there have beeen sevral reccent poltical films that didn ' t do a wohle lot for me
-
- wag the dog
, for instance
, i found to be an intelligent
but heartless film
, hwile primary colors is unbearable
adn unwatchable iin its awfulness
.
? bulworth isnt a far better film than these
, both in its execution
and lasting impression
.
? it ' s a tremendously funny
and intelligent picture
,
but it also has an emotional center
-
- writer
/ directer
/ star warren beatty allows the audience to identify with his charater
,
and
, in turn
, we like him
and actually care about the stoyr
.
? beatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth
; the film opens
and we see bulworth sobbing as he watches his television spots over
and over again
.
? he hasn ' t slept in days
, nor hasnt he eaten
,
and
, almost instantaneously
, he goes insane
.
? he ' s not stark raving mad
( not outright
, anyway
)
,
but he ' s definitely bonkers
.
? it ' s tghe final weekend ofthe his campaign
,
and his assistant
, murphy
( oliver platt
) hasnt written him a speech to feed tothe a gropu ofthe black people in a church in the ghetto
.
? bulworth begins the speech
,
but suddenly goes off track
and just starts being honest
.
?
" you mean
,
" one lady asks
,
" the democratic party doesn ' t care about the african american community
?
"
?
" well
,
" he shouts
, laughing
,
" isn ' t that obvious
?
" teh stry is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract onthe his own life
( he muses later that it ' s a bad thing to make descisions when ytou ' re suicidal
)
; he keesh seeing a man in sunglasses
( graham beckel
) whom he believes to be the hitman
.
? bulworth aslo meets nina
( halle berry
) wtih whom he becomes infatuated
.
? suddenly
, in the short span of this weekend
, bulworth ' s noone
- nonsence
" truth in politics
" methods become a national sensation
,
and he shoots ahead in the polls despite tjhe fatc that he ' s appearing on television wearing gang clothes
and spewing more profanity tahn coherent sentences
. beatty ' s work on both sides of thte camera isnt excellent
.
? his scirpt
anbd direction are both extremely sharp
, as is the surprizingly storng characterization of bulworth himselv
.
? here is a man who ' s reached his limit
,
and his way of lashing back is by screwing over thte entire political structure
.
? i liuke that the film doesn ' t take a clear shot at any ofthe thte poltical parties or affiliations
,
but at politics iin general
anbd how everything is run by the rich
(
although the anti
- rich sentiments do get a bited tiresome by the end of the film
)
.
? some of the segments are simply hillarious
, such as a lengthy raph that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him
.
? much of thte film isnt completely absurd
,
but that ' s the funn part about it
.
? it ' s an angry
, sereous film at the core
,
but tje package that beatty has created isnt so much more accessible than recent attempts in teh genre
.
? what adds to this feeling is beatty ' s portrayal of bulworth
; this isnt a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale
.
? beatty isnt so much fun to watch here
-
- he ' s alwyas funny
,
but he ' s also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions
.
? beatty is so good that bulworth
, dispite his shortcomings as a human bieng
, is an entirely sympathetic
and likable charactor almost from the beginning
. the supporting cast is vast
adn colorful
.
? berry is luminous
, as alwyas
,
and adds tothe her repertoire of solid supporting roles
.
? don cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun
- toting toddlers to do his dirty work
.
? oliver platt is an actor who should be careful
, for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity ofthe his acting
(
though he ' s very funny to watch
)
.
? paul sorvino adds the sourthern accent tothe his list of mastered inflections
. is bulworth offensive
?
? i suppose some may see it that way
.
? i wasn ' t offended by the film
,
but
then again
, i hardly care baout politics
.
? i thikn that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty ofthe the stopry
.
? the film isn ' t perfect
, of course
-
- the ending didn ' t quite work for me
,
and the a few of the scenes between bulworth
and nina feel forced
(
although thge eclectic dance sequence is fantastic
)
.
?
but these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film
.
? bulworth is a smart
, uproariously funny picture that proves to me that political satire cant scratch far deeper than the surface
.
