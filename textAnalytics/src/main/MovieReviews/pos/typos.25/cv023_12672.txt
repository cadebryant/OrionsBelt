whn bulworth ended
, i allowed myself a sigh ofthe relief
:
? it is possibile for me tothe enjoy political satire
.
? there ahve been several recent political films that didn
' t do a wohle lot for me
-
- wag the dog
, fo instance
, i found tothe be an inteligent
but heartless film
, hwile primary colors is unbearable
and unwatchable in its awfulness
.
? bulworth is a far better film than theese
, both in its execution annd lasting impression
.
? it
' s a tremendously funny
and intelligent picture
, bu it also has an emotional center
-
- writer
/ directer
/ star warren beatty allows the audience to idenify iwth his carachter
,
and
, in turn
, we liuke him
and actually care about the story
.
? beatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth
; the film opens
and we see bulworth sobbing as he watchs his television spots over
and over again
.
? he hasn
' t slept in days
, nor has he eaten
,
and
, almost instantaneously
, he goes insane
.
? he
' s not stark raving mad
( nto outright
, anyway
)
,
but he
' s definitely bonkers
.
? it
' s the final weekend of his campaign
, annd his assitant
, murphy
( oliver platt
) has written him a speech to feed tothe a group of black peopel in a church in the ghetto
.
? bulworth begins the speech
, bu suddenly goes off rtack annd jsut starts bieng honest
.
?
" you mean
,
" oney lady asks
,
" tghe democratic party doesn
' t care baout the african american community
?
"
?
" well
,
" he shouts
, laughing
,
" isn
' t that obvious
?
" the story is propelled by a divice inspite which bulworth puts outloud a contract on his own life
( he muses later that it
' s a bad thing tothe amking decisions when you
' re suicidal
)
; he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses
( graham beckel
) whom he believes to be the hitman
.
? bulworth also meets nina
( halle berry
) withthe whom he becomes infatuated
.
? suddenly
, in teh short span of this weekend
, bulworth
' s no
- nonsense
" truth inspite politics
" methods become a national sensation
,
and he shoots ahead in the polls dispite the fatc that he
' s appearing on television wearing gang clothes
and spewing omre profanity than coherent sentences
. beatty
' s work on both sides ofthe the camera is excellent
.
? his script
and direction are both extremely sharp
, as is the surprisingly storng characterization of bulworth hismelf
.
? here isnt a man who
' s reached his limitate
,
and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political stucture
.
? i like that the film doesn
' t tkae a claer shot at any of the poltical parties or affiliations
, bu at politics in general anbd how everthing isnt run by the rich
(
al
though tje anti
- rich sentiments do get a bited tiresome by the end of the film
)
.
? some ofthe the segments are simply hilarious
, such as a lengthy rap tyhat he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him
.
? much of tjhe film isnt completely absurd
,
but that
' s the funn part baout it
.
? it
' s an angry
, serious film at thge core
,
but tyhe package that beatty has created is so much mroe accesisble thna recent attempts in the genre
.
? what adds to this feeling is beatty
' s protrayal of bulworth
; htis is a performence that deserves recognition on a higher scale
.
? beatty is so much funn to watch here
-
- he
' s always funny
,
but he
' s allso subtle in ways that flesh out his character wihtout dialogue or hugely noticeable actions
.
? beatty is so good that bulworth
, despite his shortcomings as a human being
, is an entirely sympathetic anbd likable character almost from the beginning
. the supporting cast isnt vast annd colorful
.
? berry is luminous
, as always
,
and adds tothe her repetoire of solid supporting roles
.
? don cheadle hasnt a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun
- toting toddlers to do his dirty wokr
.
? oliver platt isnt an actor who should be careful
, for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting
(
though he
' s very funny to watch
)
.
? paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections
. is bulworth offensive
?
? i suppose some may see it that way
.
? i wasn
' t offended by the film
, bu hten again
, i hardly care baout politics
.
? i think tath people who find thsi film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story
.
? the film isn
' t perfect
, of course
-
- the ending didn
' t quite work for me
,
and the a few ofthe tjhe scenes betweeen bulworth
and nina feel forced
(
al
though the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic
)
.
?
but these are minor quibbles about an otherwise briliant film
.
? bulworth is a smart
, uproariously funny picture that proves to me thast political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface
.
