tbwp is propably the single most profitable film ever
. not surprising
, concidering its tiny us
$ 100
, 000 budget
, tothe date it has earned in excess ofthe us
$ 130 million
. that
' s a shocking 100 times profit
! rumours have it thgat a smart internet
` marketing
' ploy wass so successful in gaining cult
- like fanatics
, by word ofthe mouth coupled with strings ofthe excelent reviews
, thte film jsut exploded in hte box
- office
, raking infront millions on its opening weekend
. shot inwhich 16mm anbd video
( i suspect

.
)
, the film chronicles the forays ofthe 3 students who go in search for the legendary blair witch
. audiences are put in the frist
- person perspective in thge entire mis
- adventure
, oftenly wobbly
and blurry at times
, it takes a bit of getting used to in the beginning
. this is supposed tothe be the material htey dicovered in thge woods where the 3 disappeared
; edited annd put onto thge screen for the benifit ofthe our audiences
. tbwp is simply smart
. filmed to look as if it was really a stock
- shoot by a bunch of students in searhc of hte blair witch as a school project
, one may suspect
( like yours truly
) that its simply a lazy
but smart aproach to film
- making
. simply amazing in that respect
, i must say
. talk about impact
, oh yes
, tbwp doesnt have qtuie a bit
, inaddition fatc most audience will find it deeply disturbing
. i doed
, especially tyhe last bited
but i
' m nto revealing more
. you have to see it forthe yourself
. i cxan
' t help bu feel a tad cheated after knowing how commercially successful this film has become
. could it be that finally
, an indie
- film has unwittingly foudn a forumla fo commercial appeal
? or wass it all simply a ploy by tjhe big players right from teh beginnig
? well
, i guess the fatc stays
; tbwp is highly original
, clever
and will most definately leave most with something dreadful to talk
and think about forthe weeks prior to watching this film
. no gore
, noone spacial effects
, i jsut can
' t git over how terribly smart this film isnt
