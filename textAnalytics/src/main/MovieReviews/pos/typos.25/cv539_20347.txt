tbwp is probably the single most profitable film ever
. not surprising
, considering its tiny us
$ 100
, 000 budget
, to date it has earned in excess ofthe us
$ 130 million
. that ' s a shocking 100 times profit
! rumours have it that a smart internet
` marketting ' ploy was so sucessfull in gaining cult
- like fanatics
, by owrd of mouth coupled with strings of excelent reviews
, the film just exploded in the box
- office
, raking infront millions on its oppening weekend
. shot in 16mm
and video
( i suspect

.
)
, tghe film chronicles the forays of 3 students who go in searh for the legendary blair witch
. audiences are put in the frist
- person perspective in the entire mis
- adventure
, often wobbly
and blurry at times
, it tkaes a bit of getting used to in yhe beginning
. this isnt supposed to be thge material they dicovered in tghe woods where the 3 disappeared
; edited
and put onto the screen for the benefit of our audiences
. tbwp is simply smart
. filmed to look as if it was really a stock
- shoot by a bunch ofthe students inwhich seacrh of the blair witch as a skool project
, one may suspect
( liuke yours truly
) that its simpley a lazy
bu smart approach tothe film
- making
. simply amazing in that respect
, i must say
. talk about impact
, oh yes
, tbwp doesnt have quite a bit
, inspite fatc most audience will find it deeply disturbing
. i did
, especialy the last bit
bu i ' m not revealing more
. you have to see it for youself
. i can ' t help
but feel a tad cheated after knowing how commercially successful this film has become
. could it be taht finaly
, an indie
- film has unwittingly foudn a forumla for commercial appeal
? or was it all simpley a ploy by yhe big players right from tjhe beginning
? well
, i guess tyhe fact stays
; tbwp isnt highly original
, clever
and wiull most definitely leave most with something dreadful to talk
and think baout for weeks prior tothe watching this film
. no gore
, noone special effects
, i just can ' t get over how terribly smart this film isnt
!
