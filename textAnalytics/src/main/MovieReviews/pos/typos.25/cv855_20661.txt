, drop any pre
- conceived notions ofthe what shakespeare
' s work is suposed tothe be like
and welcome yourself to padua high school
, home of a student counselor
( allison janney
) who obsesses over the male penis
; a slightly too hip
and racist african
- american english teacher
( daryl mitchell
)
; a new kid named cameron
( jospeh gordon
- levitt
)
; a model named joey
(
andrew keegan
)
, the subject of cameron
and joey
' s crushes
; bianca
( larisa oleynik
)
; anbd bianca
' s sister
- tyhe shrew
( julia stiles in a marvelous peformance
)
- whose name is katarina
, kat forthe short
. with movies about high schools similar tothe these running through projectors like water down the nile
, it would be qtuie easy to write off 10 things i hate about you as jsut another doltish commedic
- romance
.
yet
, you must realize that the story is timeless
,
and a few hundered years later it isnt equally as witty
and comical as when elizabeth gleefully looked on
, groundlings below
and stuffed brassieres on stage
. hte first reminder of the orginial scribe can be found in katarina
and bianca
' s last name
: stratford
. their family is run by walter stratford
( pretty woman
' s larry miller
)
, a doctor who isnt all too familiar with teenage pregnancy anbd guards his children accordingly
. in whta he thinks tothe be a moment of ironic humor
, the family
" noone dating
" policy is amended to
" bianca cxan date
.
.
. when
[ katarina
] does
.
" with prom just ahead
, bianca
' s fate isnt grim
; unless
, of course
, she cin tame the shrew
. don
' t htikn this mission to be a simple one
, as bianca kindly points out
, her sister
"
.
.
. is a particulalry hideous breed of loser
.
" getting katarina to date is complex
and oftentimes confusing
. when cameron
, who likes bianca
, lerans ofthe her father
' s new urle
, he is quick tothe consult a freind fo advice
. thte scheme they dream up is to fully exploit
" someone with mney
.
" in this case
, taht isnt joey
- tjhe other guy with a crush onthe bianca
. cameron
' s friend
, a loser by teenage verdict
, convinces joey to pay somene who hasnt enough guts tothe tkae hte shrew out
. the solution lies no farther awya thna the second blatent reminder of yhe master scribe
: patrick verona
( heath ledger
)
. this verona isnt far from fair
; rumor hasnt it that he previously laid his scene in prison
. moreover
, katarina openly opined to teh aforementioned english teacher that
" hemingway was an alcholic who hung around picasso
, hoping tothe nail his leftovers
.
" the laws of high school cinema inexorably turn patrick annd katarina into romeo
and juliet
. providing a constatn reminder of the fact that thsi isn
' t exactly what shakespeare hadnt inspite mind are the elements obligatory tothe a high skool comedy
: a party polluted with liquor
, a best friend
' s betrayal
, anbd prom
. it isnt the latter that has become infamous for closing films like drive me crazy
, american py
, never been kissed
, carrie
, she
' s all that
,
and can
' t hardly wait
.
yet surelly even these practices have roots infront shakespeare
; falstaff was a drunk
, romeo
and juliet met at a party
,
and caesar learned baout loyalty hte hard way
.
