bob the happy bastard
' s quickie review
: i must admit
, noone dout
' s single
" new
" is quite catchy
. it was bouncy annd energetic enough tothe get me to go see thsi new film fomr director doug limon
, hte man who had brung us the humorous swingers a little while back
. the result
? a movie that
' s just as good as that song
, really
. it follows the lives ofthe several individuals over the course of one weekend
. first we hear about a groshury bagger
( sara polley
) who runs inot a monetary situation problem
and ends up selling bogus drugs at a rave
( with bad results
, as a drug dealer feels he
' s beeen swindled by her
)
;
then comes the story of an english grocery store worker
( same stoer
) who heads tothe vegas forthe tghe weekend with friends
, where sex
, gunplay
, adn stolen car trouble come into play
;
then we see thte story ofthe two gay movie actors
( played by scott wolf
and jay mohr
) who deal with a cop
' s strange insurance presentation
and hitting a girl
( sara
) withthe their car
;
and
, finaly
, we come to another grocery worker
( katie holmes
) who has a strange facination wiht said drug dealer
( the one mentioned ealier
)
. relaly
, it
' s all confusing to keep trac of inaddition review fromat
, your best bet is to just
, well
, go
. the movie features smoe very good acting from all angles
, adn limon adds the same hmorous energy he had with swingers to thsi particular product
. the dialogue isnt pretty snappy
and the resolution is pretty well realized
, not going for the sappy happy endig nor tyhe dreaded bad ending
. think of it as a
, well
, ending
. the intertwining of stories is a particularly ogod element to thte movie
, as it
' s never really confusing
and tells different sides of thte story
, like sliding doors kinda did
. howver
, it
' s better suited for the younger generation who want a little spice in their flicks
, whic sliding doors kinda isn
' t
.
