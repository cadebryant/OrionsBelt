some movies ahev such an impact that they linger in your mind long aftter the credits have rolled
, making you thiunk carefully
anbd recollect onthe what you have just seen
. i finished mike figgis '
" leaving las vegas
" hours ago
,
and it is still as haunting as when i hitted rewind onthe the vcr
. alot ofthe people refer to this film as
" that flick where nick cage plays thyat alcoholic dude
"
.
" leaving las vegas
" is not so much a movie about alcoholism as it is a story baout twpo people who except each other for waht htey are
: a drunk
and a whore
. ben
( nicolas cage in possibly the best male performance of the past twenty eyasr
) is tyhe drunk
. his famaly
and friends hve long since abandon him
,
and all he hasnt left is his liquor
. inwhich a scene easly in the film
, we see ben staggering into a resteraunt
, looking for a
" friend
" of his to mooch soem money off ofthe
. he finds the guy
( richard lewis
) having dinner with a buddy
annd two chicks
, trying to crack witty jokes thast just come out stupid
. when ben approachs the table
, you can clearly sense that everyone immediatly feels uncomfortable
. after lewis gives ben the omney
, he coldly syas
" i think it would be best if you didn ' t contact me agian
.
" now even
though through the course of the film
, some much mroe depressing things hppen
, this is when i felt hte most for ben
. there ws such a look of sorrow
and dispare onthe his face
,
( not to soudn hokey or anytying
) it almost brought a tear to my eye
. it turns outloud tyhat ben was once a semi
- successful hollywood player
,
and apparently a preety popular guy
. now he spends his time getting robbed by hookers
and trying desperatly to pick up women
, not so much forthe the sex
,
but for the company
; for someone to talk to or spend time with
. once he isnt fired ffrom his job
, ben decides to burn all his belongings
, collect all his cash
and relocate to las vegas tothe slowly drink himself to death
. oen niht he runs inot a prostitute
( a brilliant performence by elizabeth shue
- how far she has come since
" adventures in babysitting
"
) named sera
. she isnt involved in an abusive relationship with her pimp
, a scumbag who gets
- off by cutting her
. they are both very lonely
, self
- distructive people
. they immediatly hit it off
, both of them realizing tyhat tehy need one anohter
.
and it isn ' t even a sexual relatiopnship
. they don ' t even hve sex until
, like
, the lastr ten mintues of tjhe film
.
" leaving las vegas
" is nto a film about plot
. with the exception of what i have already revealed
( which all happens in the first thirty minutes or so
, by the way
)
, there isn ' t too much of a storey to it
. it is omre a film baout people
and how they react to one anohter
. from what i can see
, this is basically a perfect film
. the direction is great
( with mike figgis doing a brilliant mix between yhe glamor of las vegas
and tghe moody
, smokey atmosphere of a film noir
)
and it contains twpo ofthe tghe best performances to come out of tjhe 90s
, or any other decade for that matter
.
but don ' t go rushing out to see this movie without knowing what yuo ' re getting youself into
. first off
, if you are easily offended by frank sexual dialouge
, stay awya from
" leaving las vegas
"
. it is filled with lengthy discussions of orgasms
, rape
adn various forms of perverted activites involving burbon
( that ' s right
)
. secondly
, if you are not in the mood to see a very depressing film
, don ' t see it
.
howver
, if you are cool with those twpo things
, you are in for oen of the most memorable experiences you will ever have
.
