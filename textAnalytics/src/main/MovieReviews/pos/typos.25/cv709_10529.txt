some movies haev such an impact tyhat they linger in your mind long after the credits have rolled
, making you think carefully anbd recollect onthe what you have just seen
. i finished mike figgis
'
" leaving las vegas
" hours ago
,
and it is still as haunting as whn i hit rewind onthe the vcr
. alot of people refer tothe this film as
" that flick where nick cage plays that alcoholic dude
"
.
" leaving las vegas
" isnt not so much a movei about alcoholism as it is a stor about two people who except each other for what they are
: a drunk adn a whore
. ben
( nicolas cage infront possably thge best male performance of the past twenty years
) is the drunk
. his family annd firends have long since ab
andon him
,
and all he has left is his liquor
. inaddition a scene early in tghe film
, we see ben staggering into a resteraunt
, looking for a
" firend
" ofthe his to mooch some money off of
. he finds the guy
( richard lewis
) having dinner with a buddy
and two chicks
, trying to crack witty jokes that just come out stupid
. when ben approaches tje table
, yuo cin clearly sense that everyone immediatly feels uncomfortable
. after lewis gives ben tje money
, he coldly syas
" i think it would be best if you didn
' t contact me agian
.
" nowe even
though through the course of the film
, some much more depressing things happen
, this is when i felt the most for ben
. there was such a look of sorrow
and dispare on his face
,
( not to soudn hokey or anytying
) it almsot brought a tear tothe my eye
. it turns out that ben was once a semi
- successful hollywood player
,
and apparently a pretty popular guy
. now he spends his tyme getting robbed by hookers
and trying desperatly to pick up womens
, not so much for thte sex
, bu for the comany
; fo someone tothe talk to or spend time with
. once he isnt fired from his job
, ben decides to burn all his belongings
, collect all his cash
and relocate to las vegas to slowly drink himselv to death
. one night he runs inot a prostitute
( a briliant performence by elizabeth shue
- how far she hasnt come since
" adventures inwhich babysitting
"
) named sera
. she isnt involved in an abusive relatiopnship with her pimp
, a scumbag who gets
- off by cutting her
. they are both very lonely
, self
- destructive people
. they immediatly hit it off
, both of them realizing that they need one another
.
and it isn
' t even a sexual relationship
. they don
' t even have sex unil
, like
, the last ten minutes of the film
.
" leaving las vegas
" isnt nto a film baout plot
. with the exception of what i have already revealed
( which all happens in the frist thirty minutes or so
, by the way
)
, htere isn
' t too much of a story to it
. it is more a film about people
and how they react tothe one anohter
. from what i can see
, this is basically a perfect film
. the direction is great
( with mike figgis doing a brilliant mix between the glamor of las vegas annd yhe moody
, smokey atmosphere of a film noir
)
and it contains two ofthe tyhe best performances to come outloud of tjhe 90s
, or any other decade for that matter
.
but don
' t go rushing out tothe see this movei wihtout knowing what you
' re getting yourself into
. first off
, if yuo are easily offended by frank sexual dialouge
, stay away from
" leaving las vegas
"
. it is filled wiht lengthy discussions ofthe orgasms
, rape adn varous forms ofthe perverted activities involving burbon
( that
' s right
)
. secondly
, if you are nto infact hte mood to see a very depressing film
, don
' t see it
. howver
, if you are cool whith those two things
, ytou are in for one ofthe thte most memorable experiences you will ever have
.
