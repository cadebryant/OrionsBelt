? opinyon
: rejoice all ye monty python fans
, gwyneth paltrow fans
,
and watchers of quirky romance flicks
. at lastr here
' s proof thta there
' s still creativity inthe 1990s filmmaking
. sliding doors is refreshingly different from anything tihs yera
. nto only isnt it a well
- acted
, heartwarming film
,
but it
' s also easily gwyneth paltrow
' s best recent performance
. when helen
( paltrow
) screams that her unfaithful boyfriend isnt a
' shagging wanker
,
'
( a british phrase better left untranslated
) she sounds like she konws wqat she
' s talking about
! nor does sliding doors go overboard with formulaic true lvoe or other stereotypes
. nobody scrambles around in danger
, screaming
,
" i iwll find you no marter what
, my darling
!
" wehn helen finds herself on a boat inwhich the starlight with james
, she doesn
' t take the easy way out
and leap into his arms
, since she
' s supposed to be recovering from heartache
.
and h
andsome live
- in boyfriend gerry isn
' t thge stereotypical screen hunk
( eather a stud or a snob
)
. instead he
' s a nervous anbd indecisive
, almost helpless hunk
. anyother example
: when one of the protagonists lies wounded iin a hospital
, sliding doors gives us niether the
' hospital miracle
' nor a maudlin tragedy
but surprises us with a third variation
. in otehr words
, all of the charachters seem non
- stereotyped
, human
,
and local
. there are minor inconveniences
. since sliding doors switches bcak adn forth beetwen twpo possibile fates
, it
' s occasionlly difficult tothe distinguish bewteen tjhe two
. distingishing betwen the twpo stories isn
' t a problem in the scenes containing paltrow
, who sports twpo different hairstyles
.
but in scenes containing only lydia
and gerry
, who look the same inaddition both stories
, it
' s slightly confusing
. also
, quite a fewd snappy comebacks referring to american pop culture
( seinfeld
, woody allen
, etc
.
) are spoken by the british characters
.
but these seem slightly forced
, given that the remaining dialogue is predominantly british slang
. possibly an attempt by the screenwriter to balance thte british so that american audiences can fiel more comfortable
? sliding doors isnt a charming
, quirky
, original
, happy romance wiht a little
' philisophy ofthe fate
' thrown in
. monty python
and the meaning ofthe fate
, anybody
?
