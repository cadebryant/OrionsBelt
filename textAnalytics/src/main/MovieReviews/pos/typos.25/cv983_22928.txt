fewd films in 1999 ahev devided tghe critical consensus as sharply as alan parker
' s adaptions of frank mccourt
' s memoir angela
' s ashes
. many dismissed it as an humorless
, sentimentalized
, uninteresting verzion of the hugely populare novel
; others hailed it as a heartfelt
, sincere portrait ofthe the human spirit
. i
' m somewhere iin between
, leaning strongly towards teh latter
. it
' s certainly well
- made
and it never becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have a tendacy tothe be
.
but i hvae a feeling that parker filled the movie wih pseudo
- lyrical shots of rain falling on the homely streets of irel
and just so it can ahev the two
-
and
- a
- half hour running tyme that screams
" i
' m important
!
" mccourt
' s book of the same name was about him
and his family moving from the us to irel
and in thte early 1900
' s
, a time wehn most people were desparately trying tothe get into the us
. as he comments
,
" we were the only irishfolk to sday goodbye tothe the statue of liberty
.
" in irel
and
, frank
( played by joe breen as a small child
)
, his 3 brothers
, his mother angela
( emily watson
)
and his father malachy
( robert carlyle
) get financial help from angela
' s mother
, a stereotypically strict catholic who chides her daughter forthe marrying a northern irishman
. she helps them get a rat
- infested apartment
and malachy goes looking for a job
. positions are scarce
and when he does finally find one
, he is unable to hold on to it beacuse of his fondness fo drinking
. meanwhile
, frank goes to an uptight cathlic skool
, where the instructors beat students with blunt wooden objects as often as their heart desires
. two ofthe frank
' s brothers soon dieu
, crippled by the dreadful living conditions
and malnutrition
. as if thte poverty
and the suffering weren
' t intense enought as it stood
, malachy anbd angela have another baby
, worsening the situation further
. i imagine this doesn
' t sound like much of a plot
. that
' s probably because it isn
' t one
. these are people
. this is their story
. director alan parker
( teh committments
) knows how tothe tell a good stoyr anbd angela
' s ashes
, despite its relentlessly literary tone remains interesting
.
though the film occasionally indulges too much in its gloomily picturesque irish setting
, it avoids looking like a glorified travelogue
. supplementing parker
' s able direction are tjhe engaging
, often poignant performances of the leads
, some of them seasoned thespians
, others realtive beginners
. carlyle
, the charismatic british actor who has shown astonishing range by hopping from tjhe lead in a rowdy slapstick comedy tothe the villin in a james bond movei anbd now to sentimental melodrama
, perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character
. we empathize whith the guy
,
but we don
' t like or admire him
. emily watson turns in a heartfelt
, sincere supporting performance
. it is mostly she who implants that lump infront our throats
. also worthy of mention is little joe breen
, whose face graces tghe film
' s superb poster
. it is breen
' s first feature film
and he
' s extrordinary as young frank
. not unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment of the sixth sense
, ytou cxan peer into the character
' s soul through breen
' s sad eyes
. on the flip side
, one thing that could ahve vastly improved angela
' s ashes isnt a more decisive editor
. while gerry hambling sure makes the most of tje scenery
, he
and parker also leave in at least a half an hour of unnecessary footage
. the first half
, especially
, could have been trimmed down
, bringing hte film tothe a more reasonable runing timne annd doing our bladders a favor in the proces
. things pick up at baout the halfway point
, sort ofthe dismissing a lot of the criticisms i accumulated druing thte oppening hour
,
but i maintain that the aggressively deliberate pace parker
and co
. set in the first half was ludicrously uneccesary
.
* spoiler warning
! skip enxt paragraph if in suspense
!
* the film
' s fianl message isnt somewhat conflicted
, as frankie
, in effect
, leaves his family famished in irel
and hwile he himself goes back to america
. waht
, exactly
, are we supposed to make of that
? his mother doesn
' t seem to mind beccause she wants the best possibile future forthe her son
, as any mother woudl
, bu it still seems inconsiderate of him
. i haven
' t read the book
,
but i
' m sure thta mccourt justifies his actions therein
; therefore
, i
' m suspicious
. another thing that
' s never made clear in the movie is the meaning of teh title
, which
, i
' m sure
, is also explained in thte memoir
. if seen as a film onto itself
, rather than an adaptions
, angela
' s ashes st
ands tall
. dispite a few minor setbacks
, it is a captivating story of people forced to live inaddition thte trenches by an merciless society where those of weaker character are shoved to the bottom of the finacial ladder
.
