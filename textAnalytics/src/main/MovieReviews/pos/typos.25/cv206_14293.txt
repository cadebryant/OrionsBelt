yuo ' ve got to love disney
. no marter what htey serve up
, it isnt a guaranteed succsess as long as it ' s animated
. kids have tothe go see hte movie
.
then htey ahev to get teh toys
. oh
, thte video came out
? got to buy it
, or risk littel billy ' s temper tantrums for the next mounth
. all ofthe this culminates inthe the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage tothe mecca
: a visit to tyhe magic kingdom
. stay at the disneyland hotel
! buy a disney t
- shirt
! eat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick
! it ' s both a vertical
and horizontal monopoly wehn ytou think about it
. dale carnegie should have had it so good
. what ' s most amazing is thta all this success isnt iin spite ofthe a savere lack ofthe originality
. you see
, disney animated features these days have two components
: theme
anbd plot
. the theme changes witht each new movei
; the plot does not
. the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped
,
and try as they might to rise above the characters of previvous features
, they are nearly always destined to dont no more than the same
.
however
, hwile the succsess ofthe a disney animated feature isnt generally a given as far as box
- office receipts
, merchandising dollars
,
and glimmers in the eyes of littel children
, critically they are as varied as anything else taht hollywood has to offer
. luckily
, disney ' s latest animated offering
, mulan
, manages to be engaging
adn refreshing
, even while rife with forumla
. the film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns
, led by yhe imposing shan
- yu
( miguel ferrer
)
. soon
, china ' s emperor
( pat morita
) mobilizes his armies
annd decrees that noe male from eahc family in tjhe country shall serve to fight in china ' s defense
. when the fa familiy is served notice
, it isnt the elderly father
, fa zhou
( soon
- tek oh
) who must answer the call
, as there are no other males infact the household
. fearing her father will surely be killed in battle
, fa mulan
( ming
- na wen
) disguises herself as a man
and sneaks off with the royal orders to join teh chineese army
. mulan
, based on a chinese epic poem
, is a classic tale of tje triumph of the ugly duckling
. mulan herself isnt a disgrace to her loving family
, as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman ' s role
,
and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts tothe assess her value to a potential husband
, we see thta
" grace
" is nto noe of her strong points
. very eary on
, we are presented iwth the high importance of bringing honor tothe one ' s family
,
and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker
, mulan fails at that task
. by leaving home tothe fight in her father ' s place
, she may not onyl spare his life
,
but bring honor
, too
. as is the case with most disney musicals
, the songs are first rate
and pervasive throughout the film
. i ' m not sure if tehy will get much airplay
,
but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time
. both lea salonga
, who provides tjhe singing voice for mulan
,
and donny osmond who sings for shang
, the captain of mulan ' s army unit
and obligatory love interest
, are more tahn competent
,
although salonga ' s voice translates much better to animation
. you have tothe hear it to understand
. interestingly
, thge musical numbers which are so often done iwth big flourishes are surprisingly muted infact mulan
. there is noone signifantly big number
, which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film
,
but thsi does not detract significantly fomr tje rest of the movie
. it is
,
however
, an expectation which has been built by disney ' s pwn formulaic history
,
and some viewers may fiel as if something is missing
. artistically
, the animators have chosen to adopt tghe mroe subdued pastels of chineese artwork
,
and
although this may not live up to hte vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works
, it helps to contribute a more authentic
,
and therefore mroe credible
, nature tothe what otherwise may be seen as a typically
" disneyfied
" ethnic tale
. there are allso a couple of visually standout scenes
, one involving the charge of shan
- yu ' s hun army
, whitch utilizes the same coputer
- enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty
and the byast
. tje otehr scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it
. when mulan resolves to tkae her father ' s place
, she dons her father ' s old battle armor
,
and unsheathes a sword
. as she does so
, you can see her reflection in the polished metal
. it just left me thingking
,
" that was really cool
.
" a wonderful range of performances delight tje audience throughout the film
, varying fomr the straight
, such as soon
- tek oh as fa zhou
, to the comical
, such as harvey fierstein as yao
, a gruff
, pugilistic memeber of shang ' s conscripted army
. even more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu
, the diminutive guardian dragon sent tothe look aftter mulan
.
although an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin
, murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself wiht his own winning peformance
. i foudn the choice of b
. d
. wong as shang a little strange
( ytou may remember him as martin short ' s wedding planner assistant in the father of tje bride
)
,
bu htey utilisied robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty
and yhe beast
, so i guess anytying ' s possible
. in any event
, wong performs admirably as well
. oney character which provides a significant ammount of humor is grandmother fa
. she deserves recognition not only because ofthe tyhe levity she brings to the movie
,
but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people
. june foray
, who supplies grandmother fa ' s speaking voice
, is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel
adn natasha fatale
( as inwhich boris
anbd natasha
)
. marni nixon
, who provides granmother fa ' s singing voice
, is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices fo anna infront thte king
and i
, maria in west side story
,
and eliza in my fair lady
. with htis in mind
, hearing grandmother fa is like listening tothe a little piece of histoy
. mulan is the latest disney animated feature tothe get awya from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films
. in an effort to be culturally sensitive
(
and tothe avoid a
" miss saigon
"
- type debacle
)
, disney has also wisely chosen to employ many aisian
- american actors for both lead
and supporting roles
. in addtion to thge actors already maintioned
, the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong
, gedde watanabe
, james shigeta
,
adn george takei
. i guess clyde kusatsu wasn ' t available
. at a running time of slightly under an hour
and a half
, mulan moves quicklyu
and provides solid enteratinment for both children
adn
, happily
, adults
. this is the kind of disney feature tyhat makse you wonder what they will do next
, rather tahn hope that the enxt oney is better
.
