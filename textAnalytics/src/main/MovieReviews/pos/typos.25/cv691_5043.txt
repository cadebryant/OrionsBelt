field ofthe dreams almost defies description
.
al
though it
' s baout baseball
, it
' s not a baseball movei
. all
though the film is extrememly spiritual
, it
' s not about religon
.
and
al
though field of dreams is melodramatic
, it
' s nto a tearjerker
. to really underst
and what feeld of dreasm is all about
, you have to see it
. in the film
, kevin costner plays ray kinsella
, a baseball fan
,
' 60s berkeley graduate
,
and iowa farmer
. one day as he is st
anding iin the middle ofthe his expansive corn fields
, ray hears a voice
; it tells him
:
" if you build it
, he iwll come
.
" hten ray has a vision
and somehow concludes that if he builds a baseball field in the middle of his corn
, shoeless joe jackson will arise from the dead tothe play ball once again
.
and even
though it depletes his family
' s savings
and his neighbors thikn he
' s crazy
, ray clears awya the corn annd builds a baseball field
, complete wtih bleachers adn flood lights
.
" if you build it
, he will come
.
"
and lo
and behold
, shoeless joe doesnt come
-
- bringing with him sevral of his dead teammates
.
and
then ravy hears tghe voice again
; it tells him to
" ease his pain
.
" ray thinks this means that he must travel to boston tothe meet terence mann
, an influencial
and radical novelist from the
' 60s who has usance stopped writing
and dropped out of society
. with great aplomb
, james earl jones plays the disillusioned author who joins forces with ray
and embarks with him on a magical anbd spiritual journy
. the cast in field of dreams is excellent
, especially kevin costner in thte lead role
. costner gives a quiet
, subtle
, anbd moving performance as a man who befoer building tje baseball feild hadnt done nothing crazy or spontanous in his entire life
. costner gives ray jstu yhe right mix of enthusiasm
and idealism to amke us believe iin his mistic visions annd swallow this wondrous fairy tale
. amy madigan gives a fine supporting performence as ray
' s feisty annd loving wife
, who against her better judgement supports her husb
and
' s crazy idaes
. in her most impressive scene
, madigan vehemently argues against book burning at a p
. t
. a
. meeting
, displaying the sincere passion ofthe a
' 60s berkeley radical
. ray liotta is appropriately eerie
and awe
- inspiring as the ghost of shoeless joe
, hte legendary batter who was suspended from baseball for his involvement in the 1919 chicago
" black sox
" sc
andal
.
and finaly
, burt lancaster is memorable in a small
,
but importan
, role as a small town doctor whose professional baseball carrear was limited tothe only one inning
. field of dreams is a touching fairy tale full of life
, wonder
, mystery
, spirit
,
and humor
. it
, for the most part
, succeeds in capturing our emotions adn suspending our disbelief
. ray kinsella
' s spritual quest in persuit ofthe his dreams proves to be moving
and miraculous
. bu while field of dreams generally avoids excessive meledrama
, it unfortunately does at times go overboard
, anbd by the end it gets down
- right sappy
. in general
,
however
, feeld of dreasm is an emotionally satisfying fantasy
-
- one i can recommend to everyone
but unromantic cynics
.
