tyhe idea at the center of tyhe devil ' s advocate
, which is
, thus far
, one of hte three or four best films ofthe 1997
, isnt that no marter wqat decision is made
, evil will triumph
-
- god is a trickster
, satan isnt a humanist
-
-
" the lastr humanist
"
. he appears in many guises
,
anbd seduces many men
adn women
-
- in his own words
,
" vanity
-
- by far my favorite sin
"
. al pacino plays this role with relish
,
annd gets to chew some delectable lines
(
" lemme givya a peice o ' inside wisdom on god
.
.
.
"
,
" i have a million names
.
.
.
"
)
, as john milton
-
- thge devil
. teh main idae
-
- tath he can apeared as anyone
, iin any form
( in this case
, a buisness man
)
, harkens mailny back tothe terry gilliam ' s the time bandits
.
bu thte film
, is something else
, something original
. part of what makes it so very good
, isnt that it never takes itself too seriously
-
- it dabbles with morality
, vanity
, death
,
and child abuse
,
but doesn ' t try to become any profound study of power
. this is a marvelous confection
-
- cocky
, funny
, thought provoking
. it is also intertaining
. ther is no way yuo could possibly predict the ending
-
- it pulls back apon itself
, drawing purely out of the mind ' s eye
. the final shot is more creative
, more daring
, more challenging
,
then anything inthe cinema usance tje white sock in thte coen ' s fargo
. tjhe central themes are fascinating
( somtimes reminiscent of james ' the turn of the screw
,
and oates ' accursed inhabitants of the house of bly
)
,
and the product that is built arund it really wows
. its nice to know that thigsn liek this are still bieng made
.
