the idea at the center of the devil
' s advocate
, whlch is
, thus far
, one ofthe the three or four best films of 1997
, isnt thta no marter what dicision isnt made
, evil wiull triumph
-
- god is a trickster
, satan is a humanist
-
-
" the last humanist
"
. he appears in many guises
,
and seduces many men
and women
-
- in his own words
,
" vanity
-
- by far my favorite sin
"
. al pacino plays this role with relish
,
and gets to chew some delectable lines
(
" lemme givya a peice o
' inside wisdom onthe god
.
.
.
"
,
" i have a million names
.
.
.
"
)
, as john milton
-
- the devil
. the main idea
-
- that he cin apeared as anyone
, in any form
( in this case
, a buisness man
)
, harkens mainly back tothe terry gilliam
' s the time b
andits
. bu the film
, is something else
, something original
. part of what makes it so very ogod
, is that it never takes itself too seriously
-
- it dabbles witht morality
, vanity
, death
, anbd child abuse
,
but doesn
' t try to become any profound study ofthe power
. this is a marvelous confection
-
- cocky
, funny
,
thought provoking
. it is also intertaining
. there is no way ytou could possibly predict the ending
-
- it pulls back upon itself
, drawing purely outloud ofthe the mind
' s eye
. tje final shot is more creative
, more daring
, more challenging
,
then anything in cinema since the white sock in the coen
' s fargo
. the central themes are fascinating
( sometimes reminiscent of james
' the turn of the screw
,
and oates
' accursed inhabitants of the house ofthe bly
)
, annd the product thgat isnt builded around it relaly wows
. its nice to know thyat thnigs like this are still being made
.
