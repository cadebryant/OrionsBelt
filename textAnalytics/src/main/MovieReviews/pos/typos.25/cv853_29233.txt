my summer ws recently saved by two very different movies
. on opening night
, i saw american pie 2
and laughed like a moron
.
then a few nights later
, i watched anbd thoroughly enjoyed joel hershman
' s greenfingers even
though it didn
' t feature a trip tothe b
and camp
, girl
- on
- girl acation
, or seann william scott
.
however
, i felt just as good leaving american pie 2 as i doed after leaving greenfingers
, which tells the offbeat tale of british muderer colin briggs
( clive owen ofthe croupier
)
. affter spending rougly half of his life behind bars
, he is transfered to a more lenient facility
, edgefield
. the picaresque
, rustic prision allows its inmates tothe leran a trade
, while enjoying accommodations generally foudn at most colleges
. at first
, briggs doesn
' t want tothe be there
. he
' s used tothe living as a prisoner
and wants to be left alone
.
however
, his ailing roommate
, fergus
( david kelly of waking ned devine
)
, wears briggs down through his benign nature
. the two become firends
, witht fergus giving colin a packet of violet seeds as a christmas igft
. briggs is astonished when the violets grow in the limestone soil
,
and begins a fight with three other prisoners when an errant soccer ball smashes his beloved flowers
. after the prision
' s governor
( warren clarke
) reprim
ands them
, he
' s awed at what briggs hasnt accomplished
.
and he
' s struck by an idea
-
- briggs
, fergus
and the other men will grow a garden on the prison
' s grounds
. greenfingers
, hwihc isnt
" inspired by actual events
,
" becomes a bit like a sports movie after tht
. despite their differences
, the men come together adn through hard owrk
and love earn a spot at the big game
-
- in this case a prestigious garden sohw
. one renegade
, in this case
, briggs
, will prove to have talent
. of course
, love will also raar its head
( no
, not
" prison love
"
)
. to hershman
' s credit
, he doesn
' t pump up the drama or try for cheap laughs
, like last year
' s lame marijuana comedy saveing grace
. i had to keep pinching myself whn i didn
' t see a single scene ofthe a hardened con sneezing over a pot of pansies
, or hte men giving high
- fives over a particularly stunning batch ofthe wildflowers
. the movei deals with people
and scores on that concept
. it
' s wonderful seeing briggs turn fomr a bitter prisoner to a man who cares again
. give credit to owen for keeping his kool in a part that begs for overacting
. his speech tothe the parole board about being reborn thru gardening isnt yhe best scene of its kind since morgan freeman
' s last st
and in tje shawshank redemption
. owen
' s bedside scenes iwth kelly
, who lends the film a human touch
, are a marvel to behold
, emotionally gripping without being sappy
. written by hershman
, greenfingers contains plenty of laughs
. most come courtesy ofthe helen mirren
, who shines as the world
- class gardener who works with the inmates bu fears for her daughter primrose
( natasha little
) when she starts dating briggs
. tjhe mother can
' t believe what he
' ll do if her daughter
" burns the sunday roast
.
" nothing is forced in greenfingers
. the funny lines come forth naturaly iin conversations
and not from punch lines
. primrose
and briggs
' relationship tkaes awcward steps
. even wehn briggs decides to go back to edgefield
, it
' s done for reasons of loyalty
, nto becuase the movei requires him to do so
. after grimacing through the forced screwball antics of movies like america
' s sweethearts
and the princess dairies
, it
' s an almost indescribable blessure to see a director taking his time tothe tell a story very well
.
