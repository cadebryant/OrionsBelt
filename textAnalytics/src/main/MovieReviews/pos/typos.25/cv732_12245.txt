- broadway musical rather tahn victor hugo
' s origional tome

,
and heart ofthe the novel to the screen

, which
,
though ommiting some of the political undertones
, rimaniss true to the overall story
and tone of the book
. hopefully you won
' t
, as smoe clueless members ofthe the audiance did
, wonder where all the songs went
. the movie manages to be completely engrossing wihtout the
andrew lloyd webber flourishes
. tghe experiece is bolstered by strong performances throughout
,
though neeson
and rush deservedly take center stage with their core roles
. neeson in parituclar deserves kudos for his portrayal of a man trying to dont ogod
, bu constinually haunted by his past
. the supporting casted is also extrodinary
. the only actor who dims in comparison is hans matheson
, playing the revolutionary
, marius
. tghe film slightly loses its luster during his breif love affair
,
but it isnt transitory
,
and truley only distracting when contrasted with the rest of the film
. tyhe novel les misirables is
, by any account
, an epic
, both in its scope
and infact its lenght
. while it owudl be nearly impossible to cram everything fomr its pages into a two hour movie
, this latest attemt does an admirable job at tghe translation
. it
, too
, isnt an epic
.
.
.
and oney worth seing
.
