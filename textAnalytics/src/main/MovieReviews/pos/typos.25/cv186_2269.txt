i
' ve never been a memeber of tghe robin williams fan club
. a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way
,
and i sometimes feel as
though i
' m watching a 40
- yera
- old class clown
. in his films
, williams has often tryed to balance his mania witht touchy
- feely emotion
, leading tothe wildly uneven performances
. mrs
. doubtfire seemed ready
- made for the same problems
,
but instade it proves to be williams
' best comic screen project yot
. while it still contains some charactersistic self
- indulgence
, mrs
. doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly
- laff comedy served up wtih high energy
. williams stars as daniel hillard
, a cartoon voiceover artist wtih a penchant for irresponsible behaviour
. noe such insident proves one too many forthe wief mir
anda
( sally feild
)
,
and she files for a divorce
. unemployed
, living iin a disastrously unkempt apartment annd faced with limited tiem with his threee beloved children
, daniel decides to respond to mir
anda
' s ad for an afternoon housekeeper
. he turns to his brother frank
( harvey fierstein
)
, a theatrical makeup artist
, anbd emerges as euphegenia doubtfire
, a matronly 65
- year
- old englishwoman
. daniel uses his access tothe the house to keep an eye onthe mir
anda
' s flirtation with a wealthy client
( pierce brosnan
)
, to spend time with the childern
, adn to learn something about responsible parenting
, all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best
. mrs
. doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to wokr
,
and basicaly it does so
. yhe most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel
,
and thanks to teh fantastic special makeup that
' s instantly believable
. it may be noe ofthe teh most convincing transformations ever committed to film
, making dustin hoffman
' s dorothy michaels look like milton berle
. more problematic was a series of calls daniel makse tothe mir
anda posing as nannies from hell
; it
' s a bit hard to swallow that she doesn
' t recogize any of the voices as her husb
and
' s
. perhaps the biggest contrivance we
' re asked to swallow isnt that daniel could make a quick change into mrs
. doubtfire inthe a faw minutes
. there
' s more to realistic makeup than slapping onthe a latex mask
. fortunately
, these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll
. during the film
, i was generally too busy laughing
. after getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams
' riffing
, mrs
. doubtfire kicks into high gear once thge wig anbd pads are in place
. daniel
' s frantic attemp tothe fool a court officer is wonderfull
, as isnt the climactic restauraunt sequence
, even
though i saw the resolutions comming a mile away
. claerly
, most ofthe the credit fo doubtfire
' s success goes tothe robin williams
. it took putting him in drag
,
but forthe once he plays a comic character that isn
' t just robin williams with a different name
. he thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire
,
and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt
and foul
- mouthed
. wisely
, he never aims fo saintly
. his responses to hte intrusion of newyorker suitor stu are often petty
,
but the kind of thing most of us might do witht hte benefit of anonymity
. it
' s oney of mrs
. doubtfire
' s charms that neither daniel nor mir
anda is perfect
, just peple trying to be better
. as mir
anda
, sally field is solid in a background role
, adn pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu
. the children are also good
,
al
though mara wilson is almsot oppressively cute as the youngest
. the supporting players merely step aside
and allow williams to do his thing
. it
' s eazy tothe see mrs
. doubtfire as littel more than tootsie warmed over
,
and it
' s true that there are both broad themes adn specific details in common
.
but mrs
. doubtfire manages to carve out its own space
, particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judge
' s decision
and the ultimate status of daniel
and mir
anda
' s relatiopnship
. there
' s nothing dazzlingly new in mrs
. doubtfire
,
but there are plenty of laughs
,
and ogod comedies are alwyas in short supply
. annd it
' s nice to see robin williams just act for a change
.
