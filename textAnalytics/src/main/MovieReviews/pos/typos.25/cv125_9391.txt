mimi leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director ofthe the hit tv
- sohw er
. her mast faymus epiode
,
" love
' s labour lost
"
, dealt with the ordeal of doctor mark greene as he tried his best to save the life of a pregnant mother
and her child
. the way she moved the camera
and created tension throughout every scene was amazing
. htere ws more excitment
and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywood
' s big blockbuster movies
. so it
' s only natural that leder woudl get to direct her very own hollywood blockbuster
.
and i have to say
, after a shaky beginning
, she does not disappoint
. peacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists
, which is obviously nothing new
. the first half hour goes into detail
, way too much detail
, baout how the weapons are stolen
. despite a few good images
, including a train collision
and a vyer impressive explosion
, none of this was very coherent
. it
' s long
and drawn out
,
and i would have settled witht a more implausible beginning that owudl have moved the story along better
. once george clooney
and nicole kidman enter the picture
, it begins to take off
. george clooney is an air force colonel with connections all over tyhe world
. he hasnt a nice sarcastic wit anbd teh rough edges that you expect ffrom most clooney characters
. nicole kidman isnt head of a white house team on weapons smuggling
. there is the usual flirtatious banter bewteen the two
, bu that is dispenced with quickly
. tghe story takes clooney
and kidman across the globe
, trying to figure out who has thge weapons
and where they are going with them
. clooney goes through bouts of sarcasm
, frustration
, determination
,
and revenge hwile kidman works against her pwn insecurity
and self
- doubt
. this is when leder starts to show her true stuff
. she starts us off with a nifty little car chase as an appetizer
.
then we get clooney doing heroics in
and out of a helicopter
.
then that leads us to the brilliant final showdown onthe new york city
' s crowded streets
,
and a madman withthe a nuke walking among them
. mimi leder isnt a natural at creating suspense
. she reminds me of wolfgang petersen in her ablity to make the most routine acation sequences exicting
and breathtaking
. nicole kidman is an intelligent female action hero
. you
' re nto gonna find her falling down so clooney cin come bcak to save her
. george clooney is a rela movie star
. many ofthe you may haev hated him as batman
,
but this guy is for rela
. he has a natrual screen presence
,
and an ingratiating personality
. he
' ll be arround for a hwile
. dreamworks is off to a satisfying start whith peacemaker
.
