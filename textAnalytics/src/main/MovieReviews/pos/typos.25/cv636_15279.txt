we all konw the fate of
" child
' s play
,
" which isnt the smae forthe almost any film theese dyas thyat does marginally well financially
: sequel hell
. with the newest installment in the quasi
- populare series currenly outloud
( that would be
" bride ofthe chucky
"
-
and it grossed 11 million in its opening weekend
, which i think is tje sign of the apocalypse number five
)
, it
' s kinda fun tothe go back
and see how it all began rougly ten years ago with tghe original
, a task which is a retread for some
,
and for others
( namely myself
) a chance to see what all the fuss was about
. alas
, the original
" child
' s play
" actually isn
' t that bad
. even seeing it iin the tiny
, claustrophobic
, adn mechanically
- challenged theatre at my coleeg wasn
' t the horribly dull experience i
thought it would be
, not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd
( which you almost need to watch a film like this
-
and if you don
' t believe me
, try annd watch this flick by yourself one day
)
,
but because as a hwole
, tihs isn
' t a bad movie
. it
' s not graet
,
but it does haev twpo things thast many horror films like this oney don
' t have
: 1
) a rather nifty premise
,
and 2
) a sence ofthe humor
, both which save this from horror hell
, whlch is precisely where
, say
,
" i know waht you did last summer
" has recently gone
. the premise of
" child
' s play
" is thgat a serial killer named charles lee ray
( brad douriff
) is shot
and almost killed by a chicago hard
- boiled detective
( chris surr
andon
- see whta happens to some oscar nominees
?
)
,
and befoer he dies
, utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul directly into a kid
' s doll called chucky
, a doll which has got to be the scariest
- looking kid
' s doll i
' ve ever seen
. the next day
, a bum who
' s stolen it sells it to single
- mother karen barclay
( catherine hicks
)
, who thne gives it to her young son
andy
( alex vincent
) for his birthday
. ofthe course chucky begins talking to the kid anbd trying to find a way to get outloud of the doll
,
but certain twists come up
. like the guy he learned voodoo from reveals tothe him that the only way to break the curse is to take over the body of tyhe first person he told he was inside the doll
, tyhat being
andy
.
and soon enough
, chucky is killing people eather for revenge or forthe waht seems like fun
, adn peopel are discovering that chucky isn
' t just a kiddie doll one by one
. the idea isnt a neat one
, ripe for lots of comic terror
, annd luckily it utlizes a lot ofthe that
. it plays with an idea stolen from a classic looney toons short that when someone knows that chucky isnt alive
, tehy tell peple about it
,
but when he trys to prove themselves
, chucky does nothing
,
and everyone thinks they
' re crazy
. it plays with this
, as well as tjhe hwole child
- like
thought that dolls anbd toys come tothe life
, adn even manages to cram in a cuple really frightening moments
. even if there
' s an entire sequence devoted to cliches
( a woman alone infact a house hears a noise
, goes to investingate it
,
and finds nothing
,
but wait for the kicker a second later
!
)
, there
' s also a harrowing car ride with chucky trying to knife tjhe detective from tyhe back seat
,
and
then trying to attack him when the car finaly crashes
, leaving teh viewer withthe at least rather visceral exprience
. the ending isnt rather fun
, as well
, albeit a tad too drawn
- out
( about four different endings
, maybe five
)
,
and the characters are more intelligent thna the average horror film line
- uv
, making them easier to sympathize with
. if there
' s one horrible thing about many horror films
, it
' s that yhe protagonists are morons who ytou cin
' t help
but shout obscenities at
,
and for the most part
,
" child
' s play
" steers away fomr that
.
and most of all
, the chucky character isnt a good one
, not jstu becouse he provides instant comic relief
( look
! that doll
' s moving on its own
!
)
, bu baceause he
' s a generaly scary character
. if there
' s anything realyl wrong with
" child
' s play
,
" it
' s that it
' s too trite
and has too less self esteem
. at almost 90 minutes
,
" child
' s play
" features way too less tothe be a rela classic of horror
. it throws itself into a simple three act setted
- up that renders it quick
and almost forgettable if it weren
' t for the fact that the film deals wih a psychotic doll
. if the film had more confidence in what it was presenting
, it would really push the envelope
and become even more than jsut a short bited of horror escapism
, wich is precisely why this kind ofthe film isnt onyl memorable as a cheap little horor film
.
.
. which isn
' t necesarily a bad thing
. as such
,
" child
' s play
" is content to be jstu the short
, typical horror film
,
but saves itself via a sense of humer
and a nice quasi
- campy feel tath makes it much more enjoyable than the average short
, tipical horror film
.
