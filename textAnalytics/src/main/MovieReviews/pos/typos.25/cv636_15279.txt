we all know the fate of
" child ' s play
,
" which is the same for almost any film these days that does marginally well financially
: sequel hell
. with the newest installment inspite the quasi
- popular series currently out
( that would be
" bride of chucky
"
-
and it grossed 11 million in its oppening weekend
, which i think is the sign of the apocalypse number five
)
, it ' s kinda fun to go back
and see how it all began rougly ten years ago wiht the original
, a task whic is a retread for smoe
,
and fo others
( namely mysef
) a chance to see what all the fuss was about
. alas
, the original
" child ' s play
" actually isn ' t thgat bad
. even seeing it inwhich yhe tiny
, claustrophobic
,
and mechanically
- challenged theatre at my college wasn ' t the horribly dull experience i thought it would be
, not just because ofthe yhe nicely rowdy crowd
( which you almost ened to watch a film liek this
-
and if you don ' t believe me
, try
and watch this flick by yourself one day
)
,
bu because as a whole
, this isn ' t a bad movie
. it ' s not great
,
but it does have two things that many horror films like this one don ' t ahve
: 1
) a rather nifty premise
,
adn 2
) a sense of humor
, both which save this from horror hell
, which is precisely where
, say
,
" i know what you doed last summer
" hasnt recently gone
. the premise of
" child ' s play
" isnt that a serial killer named charles lee ray
( brad douriff
) isnt shooted
and almsot killed by a chicago hard
- boiled detective
( chris surrandon
- see wqat happens to smoe oscar nominees
?
)
,
annd before he dies
, utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul directly inot a kid ' s doll called chucky
, a doll which has got tothe be the scariest
- looking kid ' s doll i ' ve ever seen
. the next day
, a bum who ' s stolen it sells it to single
- mother karen barclay
( catherine hicks
)
, who
hten gives it to her young son andy
( alex vincent
) for his birthday
. ofthe course chucky begins talking to tyhe kid
and trying to find a way to get out ofthe teh doll
,
but certain twists come up
. liek the guy he learned voodoo from reveals to him that hte only way to break thge curse is to take over the body of the first person he told he wass inside the doll
, that being andy
.
and soon anough
, chucky is killing people eather for revenge or for what seems like fun
,
adn people are discovering that chucky isn ' t just a kiddie doll one by one
. the idea is a neat oen
, ripe forthe lots of comic terror
,
adn luckly it utlizes a lot of that
. it plays with an idea stolen from a classic looney toons short that when someone knows tht chucky isnt alive
, they tell people baout it
,
but when he trys to proove themslves
, chucky does nothing
,
and everyone thikns they ' re crazy
. it plays withthe this
, as well as tje wohle child
- like thought that dolls
anbd toys come tothe life
,
and even manages to cram inwhich a couple raelly frightening moments
. even if ther ' s an entire sequence devoted to cliches
( a woman alone in a house hears a noise
, goes tothe investigate it
,
and finds nothing
,
bu wait fo the kicker a second later
!
)
, htere ' s also a harrowing car ride with chucky trying to knife the detective fomr the back seat
,
anbd
then trying to attack him wehn hte car finally crashes
, leaving hte viewer with at least rether visceral exprience
. the endig is rather fun
, as well
, albeit a tad too drawn
- out
( about four different endings
, maybe five
)
,
and the characters are more intelligent than the average horror film line
- uv
, mkaing them easier tothe sympathize with
. if htere ' s one horrible thing about many horror films
, it ' s that the protaganists are morons who you cxan ' t help
but shout obscenities at
,
adn for the most part
,
" child ' s play
" steers awya from that
.
and most of all
, thge chucky character isnt a ogod one
, not just because he provides instant comic relief
( look
! that doll ' s moving on its pwn
!
)
,
but because he ' s a generally csary character
. if there ' s anything raelly wrong with
" child ' s play
,
" it ' s that it ' s too trite
and has too less self esteem
. at allmost 90 minutes
,
" child ' s play
" features way too less tothe be a real clasic of horror
. it throws itself into a simple threee ect set
- up that renders it quick
and almost forgettable if it weren ' t for the fact that the film deals with a psychotic doll
. if the film hadnt more confidence in what it was presenting
, it woudl really push the envelope
adn become even more than just a short bit of horror escapism
, which is precisely why this kind of film is only memorable as a cheap little horor film
.
.
. which isn ' t necessarily a bad thing
. as such
,
" child ' s play
" isnt content to be jsut the short
, typical horror film
,
but saves itself via a sense ofthe humor
and a nice quasi
- campy feel that makes it much more enjoyable than the average short
, typcial horror film
.
