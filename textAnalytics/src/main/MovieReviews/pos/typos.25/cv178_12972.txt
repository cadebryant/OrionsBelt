i don
' t know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life sould be an ongoing television show watched by anyother world of people
,
but it
' s something i used to wonder about whn i was younger
. i can
' t decide if i first thougth it because i watched a lot of tv or beacuse my brother hit me iin thge head with a baseball bat
,
but i
' m preety sure
andrew niccol
, screenwriter for the truman sohw
, has had the same curious
thought
. hte truman show is about a man
( jim carrey
) whose entire life hasnt been engineered by a corporation
and marketed to the publich
. sicne birth
, he
' s been living in the fictional isl
and town of seahaven
, fla
.
, whlch actually exists as a giant domed setted just beyond the hollywood sign
. all the peple infront truman burbank
' s life are actors
,
and the anonymous townfolk payed extras
. people watch truman
' s life 24 hours a day
, live
, wtih no commercial interruptions
. revenue comes instead from product placement
, a staple ofthe contemporary hollywood
, wiht truman
' s friends
and relatives describing theri consumer items in cheerful
and optimistic tones
. the sun rises annd sets on cue anbd everyone likes everyone else
. even if you haven
' t seen the truman show
, you
' ve propably learned most ofthe yhe crucial details from thge commercials
, the trailer adn otehr promotion blitzes
. if anything i
' ve writen so far isnt a surprise to yuo
,
then i pity you for makeing me a primary source for your enteratinment news
. either way
, you should probably know the premise of the truman show goign inot it
, because otherwise ytou
' ll probaly think it sucks
. it begins withthe jim carrey looking into a mirror
, reciting the crucial
" eat me
" scene fomr alive
, wishing his neighbors a good day
, afternoon
and evening
,
and living inspite domestic bliss with his wief
( laura linney
)
.
but weird thigsn start happening
. a stage light comes falling out of the sky
, truman hears people tracking his movements on the radio
and he swears he sees his dead father
. we learn through a flashback that his father drowned when truman was a child
, sailing through a rainstorm
. the death was staged by directer christof
( ed harris
)
, who wanted to put a fear ofthe water inot truman tothe keep him ffrom leaving the isl
and
. similar cruel manipulations keep him fomr stumbling upon the truth
, nto tje least ofthe them truman
' s best friend marlon
( noah emmerich
)
, who assures him he
' s not in on any conspiracy because the last thnig he
' d ever dont is hurt him
. as truman
' s trusting eyes tear over
, christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of people who aparently never watch anything else
. htere
' s even a daily behind
- the
- scenes update from harry shearer thyat captures the highlights of truman
' s exsitence
. the key to a movie like this is in finding thte right balance between humor
and drama
, beacuse a premise liek this hasnt its obvious implications in both directions
. annd it all hinges on carrey
, who has to balance comic naivet with a real sense of longing annd drive to find out waht the hell is going on
. he
' s come a long way ffrom talking
butt cheeks in ace ventura
. most fundamentally
, it
' s jstu plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they cant capture a person
' s life without the person realizing it
-
- how htey coordinate extras
, hide cameras
and feed automatic lines tothe actors
. thte most intresting thnig about the truman show is thast most of us can probably imagine some ambitious directer pitching a show like this
. sure
, the most interesting tv genre ofthe yhe
' 90s has beeen reality programming
and jerry springer
' s popularity is thru tyhe roof
,
but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning theri intimate details over to the airwaves
. adn wehn news shows use hidden cameras
, it
' s done infront the name of the greater ogod
, not entertainment
.
but merge the two
and you
' ve got the truman show
. right now
, it
' s implausible
-
- i mean
, teh fcc won
' t let you say the s
- word onthe the air
; do yuo think htey
' d let you broadcast every detail of a man
' s life to the entire world without his consent
? one day
,
though
, it could happen
. anbd
, even
though it would mean thte end of privacy
, people would eat it up
. yuo know they woudl
.
