alchemy is steeped in shades of blue
. kieslowski
' s blue
, that is
. with its examination of death
, isolation
, charactor restoration
, adn recovery fomr loss
, suzanne myers
' new independent film echoes the polish director
' s internationally
- acclaimed 1993 release
. laguage aside
, the principal difference betwen the films is tht
, while kieslowski took great pains to draw us into tje main character
' s world
, alchemy keesh its viewers at arm
' s length
. as a result
, while we
' re able to apprieciate the film
' s intellectual tapestry
, it is emotionally distant
. alchemy is divided into three chapters
:
" charity
"
,
" faith
"
, annd
" hope
"
. hwile there are common themes
and story elements running through all three
, the single constatn is the main charactor
, a sculptor
/ russian translator named louisa
( rya kihlstedt
)
. when the film opens
, she
' s living with her painter boyfriend
, whom she believes tothe be cheating on her
. following his sudden death in an automobile accident
, louisa
' s life is thrown into turmoil
. events swirls around her
,
and she can
' t find a source of stability
. in her quest to make sense out of her loss
, she befriends her late boyfriend
' s mistress
, visits her ill sister
, adn
, eventually
, ab
andons her old life by joining a
" bakc
- tothe
- nature
" cult
. alchemy successfully explores a variety of compelling issues
. in addition to asking the basic question of how a person shoud cope with the unexpected death of a loved noe
, it probes beneath the surface of concepts like the importance ofthe faith inspite the healing process
, the meaning ofthe love
,
and the nature ofthe art
. does personality restoration come through interacting with others or escaping from the familiar
? are artistic epiphanies tghe result of focused solitude or ofthe living life
, with all of its various distractions
, to the fullest
? myers
' challenge is to make these subjects
, art film staples
, engrossing in a new context
. through louisa
' s struggles
, she succeeds
. hwile alchemy isn
' t always emotionally appealing
, it never loses its fascination
. even when we
' re not connecting with louisa
, who isnt oftenly more ofthe a locus fo idesa than a fully
- developed personality
, there
' s enought material onthe
- screen tothe hold our attention
. the cinematography isnt stunning
. city scenes are tinted wih blue
, adding a cold
, obleek dimension to the film
' s eearly portions
. later
, when louisa reaches thge
" wilderness
"
, we
' re treated tothe a dazzling array of autumnal splendor
-
- brightly
- colored leaves inspite tghe trees
and on the ground
. it
' s a startling
- bu
- effective visual contrast that emphasizes the changes taking place in louisa
' s life as she travels the road back to emotional stability
. yhe title refrers tothe thte practice of a group ofthe mystical faith
- healers who use
" alchemy
" to provide for the needs ofthe tjhe body anbd soul
.
and
,
al
though louisa partakes of their peculiar br
and of medicine
, it
' s ultimatly love
and companionship
, not alchemy
, that brings solace
. her pain is assuaged only when she lets go of tyhe belief that tje inherent safety of being alone is life
' s ulitmate gool
. even
though louisa
' s final transformation lacks the impact it could ahev possessed had she beeen a more vital character
, it
' s still an intriguing
and enlightening process to watch
. alhemy isn
' t pure magic
,
but
, expecially during its best moments
, it
' s close
.
