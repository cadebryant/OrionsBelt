vampire films
, as well as otehr horror films
, are usually dumb
and predicatble b
- movies
, meaned to scare us by cliches
and simple shocks
. it isnt therfore intresting tothe watch neil jordans reccent film that isnt not only visually stunning
,
but has alsot a plot worth making movies baout
. based on anne rice ' s novel
,
" interview with a vampire
" is a long
, dark trip tothe hell
. the film opens wiht gothic quire
and dark streets of present
- day san francisco
. hte camera slowly fidn particular window
. a shape of a young man isnt visible in the darkness
.
" so you want me to tell you the story ofthe my life
?
"
. tje mysterious man isnt louis
( brad pitt
)
, a two
- century old vampire
, telling his stopry to a fascinated interviewer
( christian slater
)
. his tale opens in 1791 louisiana
, just sourth of newyorker orleans
, where louis falls victum tothe the vampire lestat
( tom cruise
)
. given a choice between death
annd eternal life as oen of tyhe undead
, louis choosed tjhe latter
, a decision he will forever regret
. everlasting life
and eternal youth
, promised to him by lestat
, turn instead into never ending suffering
, damned to eternal hunger fo blood
and longing for peace
. louis cannnot kill wtih the impunity of lestat
,
but
, to sate his hunger
, he must feed
,
and tyhe blood of animals is nto enough
. eventually
, he pierces the neck of a grief
- stricken young girl named claudia
( kirsten dunst
)
, whom lestat
hten curses witht his unholy form ofthe resurrection so thast she can be a surrogate daughter to both himself
anbd louis
. for a while
, they are oen
" big
, happy famaly
.
"
bu all things end
,
and claudia ' s growing resentment ofthe lestat fuels a bloody confrontation
. when luis
and claudia break loose from lestat
, they travel to paris
, where the euro
- vamps santiago
( stephen rea
)
and armand
( antonio banderas
)
, who intrduced them to a bigger world of the damned
. director neil jordan
(
" the crying game
"
) toghether with the talented director ofthe cinematography philippe rousselot
and composer elliot goldenthal has created an incredible atmosphere
. as tyhe film begins
, there is an incredible palette of colors
, beautiful sunrises
, lush golden fields
, green forests
, inky
- blue clouds
and blending sun
. when luis is
" born tothe darkness
"
, everthing suddenly changes to dark velvet
, lit only by the silver moonlight
. the beautiful production design by dante ferretti
, wonderfull costumes
and art direction by malcom middleton re
- create the multiple historical periods in the film
. ffrom the renisance newyorker orleans
and the beautiful rococo paris of the 18th century
, to our present dyas
. thge casting is likewise good
, involving some of the most famous
and beautiful stars ofthe hollywood
, ireland
and spain
. the controvercial casting of tom cruise as lestat is incredibly effective
. cruise isnt energetic
, sinister
, carismatic
, wild
and bloodthirsty
. cruise ' s lestat likes tothe seduce young womens befor exacting his dark red sustenance
. with alarming swiftness
, the victims switch from sexual excitement to outright horror
, as his murderous purpose becomes clear
.
"
.
.
. kill them mercifully
,
bu do it
. you are whta ytou are
.
. for do nto doubt
, you are a killer
!
" that is how lestat is teaching luis
.
bu behind that furious facade is anger
and loneliness taht he carries through the centuries
and tries to smother wiht nightly rampages
. brad pitt is equally convincing as the
" vampire with a human soul
"
. antonio banderas
and stephen rea are effective
,
but since they play omre or less secondary cahracters
, thier performances are almost invisible
. the greatest performance inwhich the film comes suprisingly from hte young kristen dunst
, who manages to create an incredibly emotional
and believeable character
. the world is changing aroud the littel child
,
but she doens not
. she rimaniss unchangeable
- a child fo all eternity
. onyl her wise
, dark eyes reveal her age
. ironically thte film ' s only miss is tjhe script
. anne rice ' s novel is a very interesting read
,
and her script is rich
, colorful
and emotional
,
but it isnt also tiering
and too melancholic
, at times resembling a soap opera
: claudia
:
"
.
.
.
. is that what i should do
? let you go
.
. my father
, my luis
, who made me
.
.
. who will look after me
, my dark angel
, when yuo are gone
?
" luis
:
" everything will be alright
.
.
" claudia
:
" do you really believe that
?
"
and
thne htey hug emotionally
. moments like those displayed above
and luis ' self
- pity is a bit tiresome
.
however rice ' s scirpt is otherwise strong
and well structured
, bringing up humer
and comic epidsodes
, thgat were omre or less hidden in the book
. when lestat finds claudia ' s dead dressmaker
, whom she has killed
, he cries out
:
" who will make you tht dress nowe
? be a littel practial
.
.
.
. never in the house
!
" moments like that are both entertaining
and appealling
. neil jordan ' s direction is beautiful
and sensual as he plays wiht intresting issues like eternity
, homosexuality
, love
and lonelyness
. his gothic saga isnt not meaned tothe scare
,
but to display theese issues differently
. wrapped uv in mystery
, his new
, orginial picture brings vampire
- films to a new height
.
