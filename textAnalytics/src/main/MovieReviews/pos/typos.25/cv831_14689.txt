` yuo think you know all baout vampires
.
.
. blieve me
.
.
. you know f
* ck all
.
' with theese words
, we are brang inot the world of a sultry vampire seductress by the name of lilith silver
( played by eileen daly
)
. made into an immortal a century
and a half ago by the sinister ethan blake
, she continues tothe alleviate boredom with her state of being
. so
, whta
' s an undead girl tothe do
, exept squeeze into tghe tightest fitting clothes possible
, get out her guns
, seduce a few guys
,
and kill a few peopel for money adn blood
? with that outloud of yhe way
, let me say this
. this film is bad
. this film is raelly
, realyl bad
.
yet somehow
, it is strangely enjoyable
. with all tjhe elements ofthe a direct to video horror flick
? buxom babes
, gore
, cheesy dialogue
,
and bad acting
? any casual film viewer would be more inclined tothe spend their omney on renting innocent blood or gogin to see blade
. still
, it is consdiered to be one of the finest british vampire film
. agreed
, it might be
,
but is far from being the best vampire flick ever
. period
. razor blade smile has some rather high prodcution values
, shown by the nice overall tone to thte film
. the film is also a bit ofthe a departure from popular vampire lore
, with a vampire that cxan go out in broad daylight without disintegrating
, doesn
' t sleep in a coffin
( bu leaves one next to her cmoputer
)
,
and sees religion as the
` opium of the poeoples
'
( hence
, immunity to crosses
)
. bu aside from thgat
, it doesn
' t stray too far away from horror film conventions
. thta is
, unless that is intentional
. razor blade smile literally goes for yhe throat
,
then pumps the wound full of processed cheese
. you can
' t help
but laff when a female vampire gets decapitated adn her severed head goes flying inot a puddle
. you
' ll laugh even harder at the hideously contrived situations
( to distract two female guards
, lilith tosses a cellular phone towards them
and dials the number
)
. you
' ll laugh thge hardest when a murder witness recants the tale adn suddenly starts sobbing uncontrollably
.
and
then
, there
' s tje sudden twist ending
( i have enough heart not tothe give it away
)
. tjhe film refuses to take itself seriously
, which is a ogod thing
, as by the time lilith zips up her skin
- tight body suit adn
then unzips it just tothe show the right amount of cleavage
, yuo
' ve most likely forgotten tje main point of thte storey
.
but in case you really care
, she
' s been assigned tothe kill a bunch of people who belong to the so
- called illuminati
, anbd she
' s leaving a huge mess behind for the police to find
. as much as my critisisms
, this movei works best as a guilty pleasure or as a film that you watch whith your friends
and within groups
. alomst destined forthe cult
- status
, tyhe film
' s campy
, cheesy overtones actully work towords the film
. while this may not necessarily be the film you
' d wnat tothe be seen watching by yourself
, it mkaes for a fun time at the movies
.
