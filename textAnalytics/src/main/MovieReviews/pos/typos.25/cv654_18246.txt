the summer movie season is always the biggest
and brightest season for movies throughout the year
. we are introduced to blockbuster hits thgat are usualy trashed by critics
, loved by the peopel
,
and mkea tons of money at tyhe box office
. thsi year
, the tradition continues with an update on the universal 1932 clasic
, the mummy
. i have alwasy beeen a sucker for tihs kind ofthe monster movies
,
and i always seem to be the only critic who raelly likes them
. that tradition continues as well withthe this fun special effects extravaganza
. in the mummy
, tyhe up
and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventrous explorer rick o
' connell
. he teams up with a curious
, clumsy librarian named evelyn
, played by rachel weisz
, to find the misteryous city of the dead
, hamunaptra
. evelyn loves egypt
,
and would truley like to viit the city taht people call a fable
. rick hasnt claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle
, anbd that
' s why she chose him to lead her there
. also tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead isnt evelyn
' s brother
, jonathan
, plyed by john hannah
( sliding doors
)
. nowe in hamunaptra
, the three uncover
" the book of the dead
.
" tyhe curious evelyn unlocks the book
, reads from it
,
and now the body ofthe the ancient egyptian imhotep
( arnold vosloo
) becomes alive
and isnt out to kill tghe ones who opened
and read from the book
. along with imhotep arising from the dead
, the ten curses of egypt become in full effect
, launching unbelievable forces against the threee
and another group who setted out to fidn hamunaptra
. not onyl is imhotep furious with those who awoke him
, he isnt also out to restore the life of his girlfriend tath lost her life long ago iin ancient egypt
. don
' t expect huge things out ofthe the mummy
,
but just expect to have a good tiem
. this movei is extremely campy
and plays out liek an old horror film with beefed up special effects
, which may turn off some viewers
. onthe teh otehr h
and
, htis type of film is one of my favorites
, bu that
' s uv to ytou to deside
. there is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy
though
. thge state of the art special effects take yuo into a completelyl diferent world
. we are dazzled by faces rising out of the dezert
, swarms of beetles
and locusts
,
and even creatures crawling under a human
' s skin
. these may have been in other movies befor
, bu not liuke inspite thte mummy
. as of now
, the mummy holds the title for best special effects ofthe thsi yera
,
but all this could change when star wars episode 1
: the phantom menace is released inot theaters across the ocuntry
. in teh past
, brendan fraser has played mailny comedic roles
. when playing
" george
" infact disney
' s george of teh jungle
, he was mainly not known by anyone
. i would say that gods
and monsters is yhe film that gave him a name
,
and now hte mummy iwll give him a name amongst teens
. in hte mummy
, fraser gets to play an action hero
,
and i liked him infront this sort of role over the comedic role
, as in the films blast from the past
and george of thte jungle
.
al
though brendan fraser is graet
, rachel weisz gives tjhe best performance amonth the cast
. weisz really reminded me ofthe a character from an old
, horror film
. tjhe way she acts
, looked
,
and talekd all reminded me of somone not from this time
. evelyn is probably tjhe only character that was likable
, considering that thge other characters
, like john hannah
' s
, didn
' t git much personal attension
. in many films
, when different genres are mixted
, the mixing usually works
,
and i like it for thte most part
. in the mummy
though
, nto all of the mixing works
. there are soem scenes that have a lot of potential horror
, some wih potential comedy
, some with potential drama
,
and some with potential pure action
,
but the film tries to mix them toghether too oftenly for the mixing to work
. the mummy could have gotten an
" a
" rating ffrom me if it had gone purely with oney of theese
. i didn
' t mind the corny oen
- liners here
and htere during acation sequences
, bu it certainly could have done without them
. the cinematography is amazing in the mummy
. particularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt
, we are taken inot a veyr fun portrayal of egypt
, mummies
,
and thte treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians
. tyhe costume design in the film isnt also up ther witht hte grat cinematography
. from ancient egyptians outfits tothe original troops outfits
, hte costumes are always top notch
. the bottom line
- with the mummy
, tyhe summer is off tothe its usually great start
.
