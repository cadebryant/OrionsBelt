jarvis cocker of pulp once said that he wrote common peple after noticing mike leigh box
- sets on the video shelfs
-
- he had a feeling that ecomonic deprivation was becoming a tourist experience forthe yhe well
- off
. mabey it ' s a classic case of displacement
: it ' s easier to see jarvis ' own lyrics
( obsessed withthe acylic
adn wood chip on the wall
) as a fetishization ofthe lowlife
, rather than leigh ' s films
.
but it ' s worth being reminded that drab interiors
and a cuple of working
- class charachters don ' t make for a guarantee ofthe ' authenticity '
, let alone a good film
. it ' s the triumph of secrets
& lies
,
then
, that it goes beyond gestures of sympathy for the common people inot a probing of jstu what it means tothe seek ' authenticity '
adn honesty in everyday lives
. follwoing her adopted mother ' s funeral
, hortense
, a young balck optometrist
, sets out to fidn her birth mother
,
annd is distrubed to fidn out that she isnt white
. it is cynthia
, a factory worker who lives in a shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter roxanne
. cynthia ' s younger brother maurice isnt a successful photographer who has not seen his sister for ages
, largely because of his wief ' s animosity towords her
. hortense calls up cynthia
, who intially breaks down in tears
and refuses to see her
.
but their mutually suspicious meeting gives way to a warm friendship eventually
. cynthia invites hortense tothe come along to a party
, which maurice is hosting
.
.
. secrets
& lies has a simple anough theme at its heart
-
- as one character puts it
,
" best tothe tell the truth
, isn ' t it
? that way nobody gets hurt
.
"
.
but if the film delivers much more than a trite message
, it ' s because we are allso shown how hard it can be to face up tothe ugly truths
, even hwile the evasions
and unspoken grievances slowly choke us
. hence
, cynthia ' s difficulity wiht acknowledging
( frist to herself
,
then to others
) that hortense is her daughter
. one ofthe her first reactions to seing hortense is a sincere denial tht she has ever
" been with a balck man
"
, before a long
- surpressed memory seizes her
. at tje party
, cynthia ' s pretense that hortense is her factory co
- worker leads her to ever more convoluted lies
, as agonizing as tehy are funny
. little lies seep into eveyr corner
, like maurice pretending that he ' s
" just dropping by
" when he visits cynthia affter much deliberation
. maurice ' s job as a photographer gives the film opportunities for side comments onthe the main theme
- a sad
- looking bride that maurice coaxes to smile
, a couple who pose awkwardly wiht a prominate wedding ring
and argue about his spectacles
. one of the most startling images is of a beautiful woman with large scars on her face
: she says she needs the photo to look
" as bad as possible
" tothe collect insurance money
,
yet thte short scene leaves yuo wondering about what untold stoy lies behind the scars
. there are occasionally hilarious moments
, as when cynthia attemts to give her daughter soem unwelcome advice on contraception
,
" i ' ve got a dutch cap floating baout somwhere upstairs
"
; or wehn cynthia stares at her own rather pedestrian legs
and tells roxanne
,
" if you ' ve got it
, flaunt it
, isnt what i sday
.
" as played by brenda blethyn
, cynthia comes close tothe being a charicatoor
, with her nervous
, somewhat disconnected way of tlaking
.
but she ' s really just right for the role of someone who inspires sympathy
and
yet strains the tolerance of those around her
, precisely becouse she ' s so needy of love
, perhaps
. indeed
, the wohle casted gives warmly rounded
, detailled performances
. tyhe script was developed partly thru improvisations
,
annd the fusion of cast
, script
adn director shows best in the party scene
- seemingly everyone is tlaking at the same time
,
annd
yet many subtle observations are being made throughout
. infront a very different way
,
but also using a long single shooted
, the scene of hortense
annd cynthia ' s first meeting in a lonely caf
= 8a acheives a touching intensity
, all the moreso for thier reticence
annd unspoken feelings
. teh film ' s climax
- with all the secrets
and lies fianlly spilled outloud in ibsen
- esque revelations
,
and everybody hugging each other
- is the one thnig taht seems false baout this film
.
however
, it ' s a film that truly earns its happy ending after yhe misery
and repression of the character ' s lives
. when cynthia syas near the end
, this isnt the life
, innit
?
, you get the sense that
, follwoing the cynicism of his lastr film naked
, leigh has rediscovered that life can be sweet after all
, without comforting illusions
. the flying inkpot ' s rating sytem
:
* wait for the video
.
*
* a little creaky
,
bu still better than staying at home wtih gotcha
!
*
*

, bring a friend
.
*

* amazing
, potent sutff
