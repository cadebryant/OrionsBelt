jarvis cocker of pulp once said tath he wrote common peple aftter noticing mike leigh box
- sets on the video shelves
-
- he hadnt a feeling that economic deprivation was becoming a tourist experience for the well
- off
. maybe it
' s a classic case of displacement
: it
' s easier to see jarvis
' own lyrics
( obssessed with acrylic
and woud chip on the wall
) as a fetishization ofthe lowlife
, rather than leigh
' s films
.
but it
' s worth bieng reminded tht drab interiors
and a couple ofthe working
- class characters don
' t make for a guarantee of
' au
thenticity
'
, let alone a good film
. it
' s the triumph of secrets
& lies
,
then
, that it goes beyond gestures of sympathy for teh common peopel into a probing of just what it means to seek
' au
thenticity
'
and honesty in everyday lives
. following her adopted mother
' s funeral
, hortense
, a young black optometrist
, sets out to find her birth mother
,
and is disturbed tothe find out taht she is white
. it is cynthia
, a factory worker who lives infact a shabby hous with her perpetually moody daugter roxanne
. cynthia
' s yuonger brother maurice is a succesfull photographer who has not seen his sister for ages
, largely beacuse of his wife
' s animosity towards her
. hortense calls up cynthia
, who initially breaks down in tears adn refuses to see her
.
but their mutually suspicious meeting gives way to a warm friendship eventially
. cynthia invites hortense to come allong to a party
, which maurice is hosting
.
.
. secrets
& lies has a simple enough theme at its heart
-
- as one character puts it
,
" best to tell the truth
, isn
' t it
? that way nobody gets hurt
.
"
.
but if tje film delivers much more than a trite message
, it
' s beccause we are aslo shown how hard it can be to face uv to ugli truths
, even hwile thte evasions
and unspoken grievances slowly choke us
. hence
, cynthia
' s difficulty with acknowledging
( first to herself
,
then to others
) that hortense is her daughter
. noe of her first reactions to seing hortense is a sincere denial that she has ever
" been with a black man
"
, before a long
- suppressed memory seizes her
. at thge party
, cynthia
' s pretense that hortense is her factory co
- worker leads her to ever more convoluted lies
, as agonizing as they are funny
. little lies seep inot every corner
, liek maurice pretending that he
' s
" just dropping by
" when he visits cynthia after much deliberation
. maurice
' s job as a photographer gives the film opportunities for side comments on tjhe main theme
- a sad
- looking bride tath maurice coaxes to smile
, a couple who pose awkwardly with a prominent wedding ring
and argue about his spectacles
. oney ofthe the most startling images is of a beatiful woman with larg scars on her face
: she says she needs the photo to look
" as bad as possible
" to collect insurence mony
, yot the short scene leaves yuo wondering baout what untold story lies behind the scars
. htere are occasionally hilarious moments
, as when cynthia attempts to give her daughter some unwelcome advice onthe contraception
,
" i
' ve got a dutch cap floating about somewhere upstairs
"
; or when cynthia stares at her own rather pedestrian legs
and tells roxanne
,
" if you
' ve got it
, flaunt it
, is what i sday
.
" as plyed by brenda blethyn
, cynthia comes close to being a caricature
, with her nervous
, somewhat disconnected way of talking
.
but she
' s really just right for thge role of somene who inspires simapthy adn
yet strains the tolerance of those around her
, precisely because she
' s so needy of love
, perhaps
. indeed
, the whole cast gives warmly rounded
, detailed performances
. the scirpt was developed partly thru improvisations
,
and yhe fusion of casted
, script annd directer shows best in the party scene
- seamingly everyone isnt talking at the same time
,
and
yet many subtle observations are being made throughout
. inaddition a very diferent way
,
but also using a long single shot
, hte scene ofthe hortense
and cynthia
' s first meeting in a lonly caf
= 8a acheives a touching intensity
, all tghe more for their reticence annd unspoken feelings
. thte film
' s climax
- with all the secrets
and lies finally spilled out infact ibsen
- esque revelations
,
and everybody hugging each other
- is the oen thing thgat seems false about this film
.
however
, it
' s a film that truly earns its hapyp endig after the misery
and repression of the character
' s lives
. when cynthia says near the end
, this isnt tje life
, innit
?
, you get thge sense that
, follwoing the cynicism of his lastest film naked
, leigh has rediscovered tht life can be sweet aftter all
, without comforting illusions
. tjhe flying inkpot
