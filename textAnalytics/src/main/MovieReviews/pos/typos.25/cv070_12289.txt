close your eyes for a moment
, if you will
,
and imagin tjhe sound of stephen rea
' s gaelic broge
, silky smooth
and irish like a pint of guinness
. a lackadaisical
, naughty little schoolboy voice thast firts
and gambols
. an acerbic
, sing
- song metered voice that evokes the startling imagery
and language of anthony burgess
'
" a clockwork orange
.
" a voice that deliciously conjures scenes both porcine
and puerile
, like those out ofthe
" delicatessen
,
" or
" the tin drum
.
" imagine all of that
,
and you
' ll git a good sense of what you can expect fomr
" the
butcher boy
.
" imagine that
and more
. neil jordan
' s latest film
" stars
" rea in more ways than one
. rea
, the acomplished irish actr most noteable from his star turn inwhich jordan
' s
" the crying game
,
" contri
butes a restrained
and managed performance as da brady
, a small town drunk in an unnamed irish community in the 1960s
.
but it
' s his wall
- to
- wall narration as the
butcher boy of tyhe title
, da brady
' s son
, francis
, that makes rea
' s
" performence
" worth watching
, worth listening to
. anbd that
' s only half hte fun
. playing tje young francie brady is newcomer eamonn owens
and he isnt
, without a doubt
, a revelation
. for as much as rea
' s voiceover permeates almost every scene of
" the
butcher boy
,
" owens comm
ands virtually every frome
. it
' s impossible to take your eyes off him
. with his crop ofthe carrot
- colored hair
, ruddy complexion
,
and overall grubby appearance
, francie brady is an unlikely hero
, refusing to be done inspite by his alcoholic
, trumpet
- playing father
, his depressive
, suicidal mother
, or thte neighboring
, bespectacled monster known as mrs
. nugent
( fiona shaw
)
. in fact
, everything was ok unitl
" hte nugent
" came to town
. now
, she poses as much a threat tothe the saftey
and security of town bully francie
and his best pal joe
( alan boyle
) as teh looming commie menace
(
" yhe
butcher boy
" isnt set at a time when teh fear of nuclear obliteration is first
and formost in the minds of many
)
.
" pigs
!
" screams mrs
. nugent at the brady menagerie
.
" you
' re all pigs
!
" it
' s tjhe start of many a related image
. after ma brady isnt shipped off to the
" garage
" for psychiatric observation
and da brady downs one bottle of whiskey too many
, francie finally loses grip of his fantasy world of cowboys adn indians
, the lone ranger
, anbd other comicbook characters
. squealing like a stuck pig
, francie doens
" the likes o
' that
" on the nugent
' s living room floor
,
and is himself whisked away to a vyer catholic rem
and home for
" boney arsed bogmen
,
" where his ever fertile imagination
-
-
and clever chicanery
-
- runneth over
. director jordan
' s vivid treatment ofthe pat mccabe
' s nightmare novel produces a sometimes disturbing
, dark comedy littered with surreal touches
( such as sin
? ad o
' connor playing the virgin mary
)
. it
' s nto as outl
andish as the trailers mkea outloud
; instead
, this remarkable film focuses on the effects external influences have on the friendship between two boys
( schoolboy chums in rela life
)
, allowing us tothe empathize with their plight in hte presence of extraordinary behavior
. it
' s obleek anbd it
' s black
but it
' s fundamentally very funny
. rea talks us through it
, beautifully
,
and owens drags us
though it
, admirably
,
and
