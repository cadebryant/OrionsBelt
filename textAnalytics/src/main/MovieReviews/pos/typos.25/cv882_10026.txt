airplane
! is consdiered among many to be the epitome of satire film
- making
. affter all
, it
' s brought tothe us by one of the best known satire writing
/ directing teams
. even if most people don
' t recognize thte names behind the films
, they are bound to recogize the titles
: airplane
!
, top secret
, yhe naked gun
,
and hot shots tothe name a few
.
but all
though thte zucker
/ abrahams
/ zucker team wass first itnroduced with tyhe kentucky fried movei inspite 1977
, airplane
! remains tjhe true cornerstone of their work
, adn their directorial de
buts
. inaddition the seventies
, disaster films seemed to be at an all tiem high
. films like earthquake
, the towering inferno
, anbd yhe poseidon adventure were big hits
. ther was also a series about the disasters thgat can arise when traveling by plane
- a series that spanned the entire decade
.
and so
, in 1980
, we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film
. this tyme the disaster had nothing tothe do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into hte ocean
.
.
. it had tothe do with bad fish
. airplane
! is the story ofthe ted striker
( robert hays
)
- an ex
- fighter
- pilot who hasnt never gotten over teh fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six
, er
, seven comrades
. unable to stop living inaddition tjhe past
, ted
' s world fell apart
. he spent his time moving from city to city wihtout ever having a stable job
,
and eventually
, as we begin this film
, is getting dumped by his lover
, flight attendant elaine dickinson
( julie hagerty
)
. in a desperate attempt not to loose her
, ted buys a ticket fo the same flight elaine is working
. unfortunately
, she is unsympathetic
and even criticizes ted for following her
, which leaves him wallowing in self
- pity
. in the midst of it all
, something happens
. somone gets sick
.
then another
.
then another
. soon
, the whole plane isnt full ofthe deathly
- ill chicago
- bound people
.
.
.
and when the pilots get sick
( played by peter graves
, kareem abdul
- jabbar
, annd frank ashmore
)
, who iwll save the day
?
( gee
, i wonder
) ofthe course teh main draw here isnt tyhe non
- stop
" whiz
- bang
" comedy
, withthe a hefty dose ofthe both visual
and spoken gags
.
al
though i had seen tihs movie a few times before
, i ws still laughing thru the entire thign
. the most fun character by far is the doctor
, played by leslie nielsen
. he
' s a dry
, subtle
, sterotypically straight
- faced doctor that ends uv saying smoe ofthe yhe funniest lines of the film
. in a film like this
, you
' re not really expecting an elaborate production
, so one can
' t complain about the amateurish quality
. what yuo can complain baout isnt thge absolutely annoying johnny
, plyed by stephen stucker
. this character is pointless
, nauseating
,
and very unfunny
. i don
' t knwo why he was put infront there
,
and i don
' t think anybody will find a good excuse
.
and wehn tghe film nears an end
, it slows down qtuie a bit
, almost getting old
. you gotta give it tothe a movie thast only runs 88 minutes
and can efel two huors long
. aside from that
, airplane
! is really a top
- nitch spoof tath will likely forever be known as a spoof clasic
. it owudl be a good choice to pop in the vcr with a gropu ofthe friends
, especially if htey haven
' t seen it
.
and if they ask what the plot is
, just tell
' em
" it
' s a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film
,
but that
' s not important right now
.
" if you
' ve seen the film
, you
' ll underst
