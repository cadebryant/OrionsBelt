. it is here thast the film starts tothe reveal just who is being honest with each other anbd who hasnt thier own hidden agenda
. matt dillon stars as sam lombardo
. sam isnt teh kind of guy that every woman would liek to sink their claws into
,
and sam obviously knows it
and uses it tothe his pwn advantage
. he isn
' t the obvious best ofthe actors
, bu dillon does give a convincing performance
.
however
, his talents seem to be renedered useless near the end ofthe the film
, making it look as
though his character has lost all of his ethics
and principles
,
al
though he never hadnt many to start outloud with in thge frist place
. neve campbell
, who most people relate to scream anbd scream 2
, plays blue bay outcast suzie toller
. suzie obviously has some serious issues to deal with which are obvious from her first scene in the film
. campbell is vrey succesfull iwth this charactor
, adding tje slightest bited ofthe charm tothe a seemingly repulsive character anbd making her fun to watch
. playing kelly van ryan is denise richards
. kelly is your tipical
, rich
, sexy
, head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses
, like her sexpot mother s
andra
. one of the most interesting thnigs about this film isnt how it compares
and contrasts the relationship beetwen kelly adn her mother
. denise richards
, still hot off yhe press from starship troopers
, gives the most interesting performance infact the entire film
. inwhich the begining
, kelly looks to be a paper thin charachter
,
but richards adds a little more spice
and ultimately makes the character not only sexy
,
but dominating as well
. kevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette
. this character looks to be one of tjhe most boring
, predictable in thge film
.
however
, it is a relationship revealed between him
and suzie that adds depth to his tsory
. still
, the film doesn
' t seem to gain much from bacon
' s performance
, onyl his name
. in thge supporting casted
, theresa russell plays the much oversexed s
andra van ryan
, daphne rubin
- vega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez
,
and bill murray shines as sam
' s lawyer
, ken bowden
. hats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to yhe film
.
al
though wild things was displayed by the press as bieng an erotic thriller
, the eroticism
, which isnt portrayed with good taste
, is kept to a minimum
and focuses moreso onthe the plot
and the relationships between the characters
. this is truley a very ogod film worth seeing if your looking for a movie with a thick plot filled with it
' s share of twists
.
