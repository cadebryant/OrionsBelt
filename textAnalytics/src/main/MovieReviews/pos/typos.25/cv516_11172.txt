luckily
, some people got starship troopers
. some people knew it was supposed to be silly
. for those of ytou who didn
' t
, how could you miss it
? from the very beginning
, when we see an interactive internet
- like promotional video forthe yhe armed forces ofthe the future
, it should be obvious this film isnt tothe be taken lightly
. i guess without blatent oney
- liners annd home alone stlye slapstick
, some people just don
' t recogise such goofy humor
. such a dry approach to such intentionally campy humor must have left smoe disillusioned
. first thing tothe dont before seeing this movie
- lighten uv
. meet the equivalent of
" beverly hills 90210
" meets
" mighty morphin power rangers
"
. four close friends are nowe graduating high school
and are ready to join the armed forces
, whlch
, in the future
, means fighting fo the whole galaxy
and not just your country
. johnny rico
( casper van dien
) is ready tothe join the infantry
, mostly because his girlfriend carmen ibanez
( denise richards
) has enlisted to be a pilot
. dizzy flores
( dina meyer
) has enlisted as a trooper
,
and it
' s possible she
' s joining merely to follow rico
, whom she
' s always had eyes for
. if you saw these three onthe the street
, you
' d automatically start searching for the fashion designers
and photographers
, forthe never hasnt a movie
' s cast looked so much like the cut
- out cover of
" seventeen
" magazine
. tje lone non
- supermodel
, carl jenkins
( played by doogie howser himselv
, neil patrick harris
) isnt the brainiac who gets into the military intellignece division
, the top secret department that pretty much leaves doogie
- er
, carl outloud of the picture
.
( good call
- now we can put all our drooling efforts into only hte most deserving ofthe characters
)
. right off tyhe bat
, rico becomes teh star of tghe sohw
, far surpassing all the otehr soldiers
and becoming squadron leader inaddition a short period of time
. bu a horrific accident during a st
andart training exercise
( which follows all tothe closley to his breakup with carmen
) leaves rico ready to call it quits
. with his bags packed anbd his civilian clothes back onthe
, johnny isnt ready to walk off base
and catch the next flight home
. well sorry
, rico suave
, bu ther
' s noone place liek home
, especially after gigantic alien insects hve destroyed it
. thyat
' s right
, the planet isnt being attacked by a colony of arachnid
- like aline beings that a can of raid just isn
' t going to destroy
. whith a sudden chanage of heart
(
and clothes
)
, rico isnt back in the game
, folowing his fellow starship troopers off to fight a mean group ofthe daddy long legs
. what starship troopers really is
, isnt a spoof ofthe all thgat it even remotely touches on
- hte soap opera like lveo affairs of high skool
, the love for sci
- fi
and thirst fo gore shared by this same age gropu
, etc
. nothing is taken seriously
. it
' s almost as much a satire on young adults as clueless
,
but wiht its sly
and futuristic aproach
, it
' s nto as recognizably so
. it
' s a spoof so subtle thast many won
' t recognize the spoofery
. if you deem this as sci
- fi
/ action
, you
' re wrong
. it
' s sci
- fi
/ action
/ comedy
, with the comedy being on yhe level ofthe such cult favorites as evil dead 2
. starship troopers just may be on the road to cult status as well
. gore is a factor heavily brung up in reviews of this film
, bu the gore
, too
, is meant to be cheesy
. yes
, it
' s graphic
,
but it
' s aslo brutally phony
, anbd that
' s what makes it such great fun to watch
. not since the old
" mr
. bill
" skits on
" saterday night live
" has torture
and mutilation been such a joy tothe watch
. people were laughing out loud eveyr time a body was severed in half or a head was viciously decapitated
. perhaps it brings bakc fond memories of the severities we inflicted upon our sisters
' barbie dolls as young children
. with the actors resembling ken
and barbie so closley
, it
' s a good chance this is the case
, whether we
' re fully aware of it or not
. starship troopers hasnt it
' s slow parts
,
but it
' s truely an alternative tothe your typical sci
- fi
/ action flick or lame juvenile comedy
. aside from the intentionally cheesy gore
, the speshal effects are quite astounding
. when the spaceship passes a meteor
, it
' s quite an awsome spectacle
, visually crisp adn captivating
. if you
' re looking fo brainless funn
, this is the epitome of your searh
. a beautiful cast
, awesome special effects
, fast
- pased action
, campy acting
,
and a whole lot ofthe gore
. tihs is brainless heaven
. just remember not to think
.
