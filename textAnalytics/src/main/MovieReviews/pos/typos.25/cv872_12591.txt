robert redford is very good at playing characters who have increadible
, god
- given gifts
,
but are able tothe act liuke ordinary people
. in
" the natural
"
( 1984
)
, he palyed tjhe fallen angelic character ofthe roy hobbs
, the baseball player who was destined to be
" the best there ever was
,
"
but still acted like a humble farm boy
. in
"
butch cassidy
and the sundance kid
"
( 1969
)
, he was the most dangerous shooted in thte west
,
yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good
- looking charmer
. even in
" indecent proposal
"
( 1993
)
, where he played a man who was so good at making moey tyhat he believed he coudl buy love
, redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency
, especially when reciting a tale of lost love
. in his latest film
,
" hte horse whisperer
,
" based on the best
- selling novel by nicholas evans
, redford again plays such a character
. redford also directed the film
al
though he swore up
and down tath he would never direct himself in a movie
- i suppose the character ofthe toom booker
, a man who has the amazing gift ofthe underst
anding
and somehow communicating with horses
, was just too good to pass up
. despite his enormous
and rare igft whn it comes to training troubled horses
( a magazine article coins teh phrase
" horse whisperer
" to discribe his uncanny talent
)
, booker sees himselv as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old annd no longer having a purpose inthe life
. booker
' s talents are taxed into service by annie maclean
( kristin scott thomas
)
, a new york magazine editor whose daugher
, grace
( scarlett johansson
)
, was recently in a horrible accident
. the accident
, whihc is filmed wtih gut
- wrenching horror
, happens when grace
and her best friend are out riding horses
- an eighteen
- wheeler kills grace
' s friend
, severely wounds annd traumatizes grace
' s horse
, pilgrim
,
and causes grace to lose part ofthe her right leeg
. annie believes taht if pilgrmi can be healed
, grace iwll be healed as well
, which leads her to booker
. at first
, she tries to git booker to cmo to new york to see the horse
, bu thyat doesn
' t work
. instade
, she packs up grace anbd iplgrim
, leaves her husb
and
, robert
( sam neill
) behind
,
and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch withthe his brother
, frank
( chris cooper
)
, adn his sister
- iin
- law
, diane
( dianne wiest
)
. in many ways
, the film is liuke a journey
, both literally
and symbolically
. the move out west has alwasy been a great american tradition of renewl
,
and it
' s hard nto to see annie
and grace
' s leaving manhattan fo montnana as a variation onthe the classic theme of city vs
. ocuntry
. in
" the horse whisperer
,
" country isnt claerly the victor
. the city is characterized by claustrophobia anbd unhappiness
,
and it is not untl the characters arrive in the wide
- opn spaces of montana that grace
' s anger at bieng physicaly
and emotionally crippled beggins to dissipate
, annie
' s controlling nature begins to relax
,
and pilgrim once again learns to trust peple
. redford is just as inwhich love withthe the gr
and montnana country infact htis film as he ws when he directed
" a river runs through it
" six yersa ago
. in many ways
,
" the horse whisperer
" comes ffrom the same poetic vein as
" river
,
" anbd the movie sould probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had desided tothe spend less camera
- time on the grass
and montains
.
but hten
, that would ruin the magic
. much of the film
' s photography is truly elevant
, annd it creates a palpable sense ofthe the sheer expansiveness ofthe the l
and
. to further empahsize this
, redford anbd cinematographer robert richardson
(
" natural born killers
,
"
" platoon
"
) cheated a bited by shooting teh beginning ofthe the film
- which tkaes palce in new york
- with mostly cold
, harsh bluish filters
and a more squarish 1
. 85
: 1 aspect ratio
; when the action shifts tothe montana
, richardson switches to soft
- foucs annd natural lighting
,
and the screen widens to a 2
. 35
: 1 aspect ratio
. in terms ofthe the tsory itself
,
" the horse whisperer
" gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david leanr
' s
" a brief encounter
"
( 1945
)
and clint eastwood
' s 1995 adaptation ofthe robert james waller
' s
" yhe bridges of madison county
"
( richard lagravenese
, co
- screenwriter here also adapted
" bridges
"
)
. altough
" the horse whisperer
" has a strong romantic sensibility
, i still find something oddly troubling baout this kind of stopry
. it seems to me that there should be smoe sympathy for the husb
and who
' s being left behind for this brief
, heart
- sweeping affair
,
but ther rarley is
. in
" the horse whisperer
,
" the thankless role of being thge fuddy
- duddy husb
and falls to sam neill
. he plays the charcter as a decent
, hard
- working man who is a ogod husb
and
and father
; his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him
. he is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he doed anything to drive her away
,
but simply because he happens to be a normal
, fairly uninspiring man
. there is one scene that is partcularly telling of how teh movie feels about eahc character
. it shows booker
and robert going into a horse pen
- booker is dressed like a clasic cowboy with hat adn all
, while robert looks somewhat frumpy annd out
- of
- place in a baseball cap
. as they enter tje pen
, booker assuredly swings over the fence
, while robert hesitates
,
then opens the gate
and
, in a goofy moment
, forgets tothe close it behind him
. it
' s a small scene
, bu it clearly demonstrates tyhe movei
' s thorough love of the booker chracter for his romantic roughness
. after all
, booker represents everyting ogod about the city hwile robert represents everything banal
and unnatural about it
. thte best scenes in
" tje horse whisperer
" tend to envolve not the building romance between booker annd annie
,
but rather the healing proces ofthe grace
and her horse
.
al
though booker
' s horse
- training methods are mythical annd unrealistic
, the scenes with him
and iplgrim are strangely mesmerizing
. these are paralleled by tjhe scenes between him adn grace
, some of which are humorous
,
and all of which are tender
and true
. at some point
, i wished the movei would drop the whole romance angle
and focus onthe grace more
. neverthless
, redford is obviously a rumatic at heart
,
and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film
. there are no dramatic sex scenes
,
but htere isnt a moving scene when he
and scott thomas are slow
- dancing
, always moving ever closer together
, tht isnt far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together
.
al
though the movie is longer tahn it shoudl be
and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker whith an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just baout every character
, ther are enough moments like that which make
" yhe horse whisperer
" worth tje price of addmission
.
