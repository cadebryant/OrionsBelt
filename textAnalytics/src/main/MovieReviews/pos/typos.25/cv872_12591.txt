robert redford is very good at playing characters who hvea incredible
, god
- given gifts
,
but are able to act like ordinary people
. in
" teh natural
"
( 1984
)
, he played hte fallen angelic charcter ofthe roy hobbs
, the baseball payler who ws destined to be
" hte best there ever was
,
"
but still acted like a humble farm boy
. in
" butch cassidy
and the sundance kid
"
( 1969
)
, he was teh most dangerous shot in yhe west
,
yet he came off like a nothing more tahn a boyishly good
- looking charmer
. even in
" indecent proposal
"
( 1993
)
, where he plyed a man who ws so good at making money that he believed he could buy love
, redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency
, especially whn reciting a tale of lost love
. in his latest film
,
" thge horse whisperer
,
" based onthe the best
- selling novel by nicholas evans
, redford again plays such a character
. redford allso directed the film
although he swore up
and down taht he would never direct himself in a movie
- i suppose the chracter of tom booker
, a man who has tyhe amazing gift of understanding
and somehow communicating withthe horses
, was just too ogod to pass uv
. dispite his enormass
and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses
( a magazine artice coins the phrase
" horse whisperer
" to describe his uncanny talent
)
, booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old
and no longer hvaing a purpose in life
. booker ' s talents are taxed inot service by annie maclean
( kristin scott thomas
)
, a new york magazine editor whose daughter
, grace
( scarlett johansson
)
, was recently in a horrible accident
. the accident
, which isnt filmed with gut
- wrenching horror
, happens whn grace
and her best firend are out riding horses
- an eighteen
- wheeler kills grace ' s friend
, severely wounds
and traumatizes grace ' s horse
, pilgrim
,
and causes grace to lose part of her right leg
. annie believes tht if pilgrim cin be healed
, grace iwll be healed as well
, whcih leads her to booker
. at firt
, she tries to git booker to come to new york to see the horse
,
but that doesn ' t owrk
. instade
, she packs uv grace
and pilgrim
, leaves her husband
, robert
( sam neill
) behind
,
anbd heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother
, frank
( chris cooper
)
,
and his sister
- inwhich
- law
, diane
( dianne wiest
)
. in many ways
, the film is like a jouney
, both litterally
and symbolically
. the move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal
,
and it ' s hard nto tothe see annie
adn grace ' s leaving manhattan for montnana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs
. country
. in
" the horse whisperer
,
" country is claerly the victor
. the city isnt charaterized by claustraphobia
and unhappiness
,
anbd it is not untl thte charactors arrive in the wide
- open spaces of montana that grace ' s anger at being physically
and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate
, annie ' s controlling nature begins tothe relax
,
anbd pilgrim once again lerans tothe trust people
. redford is jsut as in lvoe with the grand montana country in tihs film as he ws when he directed
" a river runs thru it
" six years ago
. inthe many ways
,
" the horse whisperer
" comes from the smae poetic vein as
" river
,
"
and the movie could probably be a good fifteen mintues shorter if redford had decided tothe spend less camera
- time on the grass
and mountains
.
but
then
, that owudl ruin the magic
. much of the film ' s photography is truely elevant
,
adn it creates a palpable sense of tyhe sheer expansiveness of the land
. to further empahsize thsi
, redford
adn cinematographer robert richardson
(
" natural born killers
,
"
" platoon
"
) cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film
- which takes place in new york
- iwth mostly cold
, harsh bluish filters
and a more squarish 1
. 85
: 1 aspect ratio
; when the action shifts to montana
, richardson switches to soft
- focus
adn natural lighting
,
anbd the screen widens tothe a 2
. 35
: 1 aspect ratio
. in terms of the story itself
,
" the horse whisperer
" gives us the smae romanticized veiw ofthe adultery found in david lean ' s
" a brief encounter
"
( 1945
)
and clint eastwood ' s 1995 adaptation of robert james waller ' s
" the bridges of madison county
"
( richard lagravenese
, co
- screenwrighter here also adapted
" bridges
"
)
.
although
" hte horse whisperer
" hasnt a strong rumatic sensibility
, i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story
. it seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who ' s being left behind for htis brief
, heart
- sweeping affair
,
but there rarley is
. in
" the horse whisperer
,
" teh thankless role of being tghe fuddy
- duddy husband falls to sam neill
. he plays hte character as a decent
, hard
- working man who is a good husband
anbd father
; his only failure is tht he loves his wife more thna she loves him
. he is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away
,
but simply because he happens to be a normal
, fairly uninspiring man
. there isnt one scene tyhat is particularly telling of how tje movie fiels baout earch character
. it shows booker
and robert oging inot a horse pen
- booker isnt dressed like a clasic cowboy wtih hat
and all
, hwile robert looks somewhat frumpy
and out
- of
- place in a baseball cap
. as they enter the pen
, booker assuredly swings over tghe fence
, hwile robert hesitates
,
then opens teh gate
and
, infront a goofy moment
, forgets tothe close it behind him
. it ' s a small scene
,
but it clearly demonstrates the movie ' s thorough loev ofthe tghe booker carachter for his romantic roughness
. after all
, booker represents everything ogod baout the city hwile robert represents everything banal
and unnatural about it
. the best scenes in
" thte horse whisperer
" tend to involve nto the building romance betwen booker
adn annie
,
but rather the healing process of grace
and her horse
.
although booker ' s horse
- traning methods are mythical
and unrealistic
, teh scenes with him
anbd pilgirm are strangely mesmerizing
. these are paralleled by the scenes between him
and grace
, some ofthe which are humorous
,
and all of which are tender
and true
. at some point
, i wished the movei would drop the whole romance angle
anbd focuse onthe grace more
. nevertheless
, redford is obviously a romantic at heart
,
and he brings a light touch tothe the erotic moments infront the film
. there are no dramatic sex scenes
,
but there is a moving scene when he
adn scott thomas are slow
- dancing
, alwyas moving ever closer together
, that is far mroe erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together
.
although yhe movie isnt longer than it should be
and isnt essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that garantees unhappiness for just about every character
, there are enough moments liek that wich make
" the horse whisperer
" worth the price of admission
.
