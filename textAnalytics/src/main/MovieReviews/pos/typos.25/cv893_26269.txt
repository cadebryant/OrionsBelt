let me open this one with a confession
: i lveo cop movies
. i adore them with such an unwavering
, near foolish passion thta i was atually one of the first in line to see 1998
' s one tough cop starring tjhe smirkiest ofthe the baldwin brothers
, steven
. was it any good
? well
, just about as good as baldwin
' s steven seagal impression
( for those i
' ve confused the answer is a resounding no
!
)
. now let me clarify
, i don
' t love jstu any cop movie
; i
' m not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80
' s
and now slowly
( gulp
) returning thanks to jackie chan annd chris tucker
. i
' m partial to those gritty
, earthy cop dramas like serpico
, donnie brasco
, anbd the french connection
. probelm is theese films come along just about as often as george w
. bush makes a cogent point so whenever a
" true
" cop movei does hitted multiplexes
, i come running towords it like an eager puppy
?
?
? annd inevitably i leave
, head bowed
, tripping over my squiggly tail
. so what is it about cop movies thgat tranform me inot a moron willing to shell outloud
$ 7
. 50 for a movie called one tough cop
( which actually soudns a lot like a wiseguy spin
- off
, noone
?
)
? truth is i
' m a sucker fo those barren streets
, that gritty
, graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk
and cops
, like modern day knights
, must shield us fomr their iniquitous clutches
. yes it
' s all vyre corny
and awfully boys clubish
, which
, i
' m guessing
, is precisely where theese feelings come fomr
. as little tots us boys are brought uv to create our own wars with gi joe
' s
, enact cops
and robbers or cowboy
and indian fantasies
, etc
. the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies
,
and heighten them
, turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines
and psychological chaos
. as an adult my tastes haven
' t changed all that drastically
; sure i can git a cerebral high from yhe emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film
,
but i still delight at the promise a
" guy
" film could potentially bring
. nowe what if it
' s the cops who
' re thte corrupt ones
? ooh that one really gets me going
, these protectors using all that at their service
, taking advantage of others forthe their own gain
. throw a courtroom drama
( yech
!
) into the pot
and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince ofthe the city
. how absorbing is prince of the city
, ytou ask
? so damn absorbing that when the film shifts ffrom gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama
( a sub
- genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar
) i remained completly
and utterly involved
. tje film stars treat williams
, who gives the kind of performance that should hve skyrocketed his career up to the levle that brad pitt currently resides at
. since i was hatched a mere two yeras prior to the release of prince of the city
, i cannot provide an answer as to why it didn
' t
.
(
though judging fomr his recent roles inaddition tripe like deep rising
and dead heat i owudl guess tht it probaly has something to do with qtuie a few bad carrear moves
)
. like mickey rourke
and eric roberts
( both of whom are currently doign time infact direct tothe video purgatory
) williams is a talented leading man who didn
' t make it to where he should have
.
( if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct tothe video hell
)
. here
, the actor is given a role nto all that dissimilar from al pacino
' s infact serpico
( alsot directed by lumet
)
. williams plays danny ciello
, a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on thte gritty pre
- juliani streets of newyorker york
. htey work without uniforms or housr much like paid vigilantes
.
and that analogy is moreso tahn apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into useing corrupt means to get the job done
. the squad relies entirely on informants
( low level junkies
) to gain access to tje big wigs
,
and in order to obtain the info they seek
, they somtimes have to provide tghe junkies with thge junk ofthe their choice
. danny has done this
, anbd
though he
' s a fairly honarable guy
, who took the job in order to do good
, his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way
. he seeks redemption
and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking tothe internal affairs who hten convince him tothe go undercover as a
" double agent
"
. he does so with one condition
: he will not rat on his partners
. right away we know that that is exactlly what he
' ll have to do
.
and watching the movie build tothe that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be
. undercover cop films are almost innately exciting
, even the kind that pul out all the cliches
( like in too deep
)
. how can noe not be moved by the issues of betrayal
, ambiguity
,
and tje danger inthe putting oneself inwhich such a risky position
? prince ofthe the city takes all htis
and charges it with a perceptive
, hard boiled script adn taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet
, as well as a h
andful of intense performances
, most notably by treat
. lumet
' s greatest contri
bution to thge movie is how he lays back
,
and lets the camera soak up the action
. his scenes transition rapidly from oney to the enxt buiding layers of tension
,
and he rarley holds for reaction shots
, instead he clicks away at precisly the moment a character stops yakking
. lumet
' s worst tendency isnt noe that many film makers
( especially oliver stone
) tend to overuse
: he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably inwhich order tothe ratchet uv the tension
. this isn
' t as much a probelm here as it was in night falls on manhattan
, lumet
' s most recent cop
\ lawyer endeavor
, a movie tht nearly gave me an ulcer ffrom just watching
.
though of late lumet has made several really awful career choices
( maybe he
and treat should git together forthe a drink or something
)
, the most receet a completely unnecessary remake ofthe gloria
, here he wass on
, sustaining tension in a film that runs forthe 167 minutes with not oney dull spot
. some ofthe the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic
. hollywood often forgets how eazy it isnt to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable
. ofthe course cop movies aren
' t popular anymore
( yes buddy cop ficks are popular
but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines
)
,
but jsut look at the average hollywood action movies
, flicks so bloated
and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves noone purpose other than to stall the acation
and demonstrate that our hero isn
' t gay
, tjhe lame comic relief character who
' s never funny
,
and on
and on
. for all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a bakc to the basics cop
\ courtroom drama that leaves outloud all thge crap adn really thrills
. it focuses completely onthe its story
, adn its charactors all ofthe whom are completely believable fomr the cops to the lawyers to teh junkies
. there
' s a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer annd looks as if he
' s about tothe go into one ofthe those corny braveheart inspirational speeches
,
but instead he breaks down in front of the cop
and begins sobbing
. this is a scene tyhat would never amking it into a michael bay film
( even
though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end ofthe armageddon
, not one damn tear
) it would be cut out because the directer woudl say oh that mkaes him too human
, excuse me
, weak
. in hte very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness
, straining tothe git the words out
. he
' s lost his voice
. does thgat little itty bitty detail matter
? maybe not tothe most
, bu it sure made my night
.
and in a sprawling epic ofthe corruption
, greed
, betrayal
and violence it
' s nice to see that someone is paying attention tothe the little thigns
.
