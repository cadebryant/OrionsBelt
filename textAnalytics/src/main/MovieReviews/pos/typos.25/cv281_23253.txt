hwile watching boiler room
, i was constantly reminded of lastr year
' s masterpiece fight club
. both films consist of a predominately male casted
. both films follow young men as they illicitly fight the traditional sytem for their own desires
.
and both films are seen through the eyes of noe narrator
, who eventially realizes that these men have to be stoped
. while boiler room writer
/ directer ben younger does not git his point across as well as david fincher does for fight club
, he does conti
bute anyother impressive wokr tothe a series of films aiming to represent the new generation
. a generation which has seen hte internet prosper
and where everyone whants to be a millionaire
. paying homage tothe oliver stone
' s 1987 classic wall strent
, younger is almost modernizing the tale by using younger
, hipper actors to play the greedy villains as opposed to the older
, more experienced types
. as is true in rela life
, younger minds are becoming richer anbd richer from their knowledge of mroe st
andard technology
. boiler room dismisses the notion of ingenuity
and shows that greed
and desire fo power come in all ages
. another similarity with fight club is that both films are nto action flicks
. some peple are conviced that an all
- male cast automatically means there must be gory violence
, here is proof that this is not true
. if ytou want to see an action movie starring ben affleck
, go see riendeer ganes this weekend
. if you want tothe see a smart
, insightful film with excellent acting anbd a clever scirpt
, see boiler room
. giovanni ribisi gives an oust
anding performence as the film
' s narrator
, seth
. affter droping out of coleeg
and running a lucrative gambling center fo college students in his apartment
, seth is offered a high paying job by a wealthy man
( nicky katt
)
. he agrees tothe take thte job
( in which you are guaranteed to become a millionaire within three years
) of selling stock to well
- off americans from the mid
- west over the telephone
and begins to fit in quite well with his co
- workers
. learning tricky techiniques to deceive innocent people into buying shares of a good inspite production
, seth figures htis isnt too good tothe be true
. aftter stumbling into a room at the wrong time
, he knows there is something no good baout this company
. at this point
, seth is left with the ultimate choice
; continue with the american dream
and make millions or tell the authorities thgat something fishy is going onthe
. ribisi is believable as seth especialy whn he shares scenes with ron rifkin
, playing seth
' s dad
. yhe two have perfect chemestry as a troubled father
and son trying to impress each otehr
and simultaneously imbaress themslves
. tghe transitions ffrom anger to sympathy that these scenes contain are the st
andout segments of the entire film
. tghe supporting cast ofthe greedy co
- workers isnt aslo flawless
. ben affleck shines infront a short
but sweet performance as a recruiter for the comany
, nicky katt isnt fabulous as the ostensibly friendly boss who evenhtually becomes extremely jelous ofthe seth
,
and vin diesel gives his best performance of his career as tje foil character of nicky katt
. thte energy of the cast as a whole makes boiler room well pased
and never boring
. teh only major error inspite thge film is that nothing major happens
. there is no big plot twist or climatic point tothe make the film more memorable
. due to the lack ofthe a major event
, boiler room never finds a suitable genre to fit into
. tjhe movie is not intense anough to be a thriller
, the romantic segments involving seth
and abby
( nia long
) are not propperly finalized
,
and the dialogue isn
' t funny enough tothe make it a comedy
. in having trouble to characterize the movie as a wohle
, boiler room is slightly confused at times
. it doesn
' t seem to konw hwihc categry to fit itself inot
. one satisfying concluding scene could have changed tghe wohle film for the better
. otherwise
, tje movie is fun to watch thanks tothe its livley casted of young actors
.
