you don
' t want tothe be like mike
. mike has been doing badly
. embarrassingly bad
. he borke up a six
- eyar relationship six months ago to move fomr n
. y
. to l
. a
.
and he
' s still not over her
. as a result
, his jokes fall flat whn he tries tothe impress
, adn he
' s a comedian
. well
, an unemployed comedian
, one ofthe hollywood
' s little fish
,
and it has gotten so bad he
' s asked fo an application at starbuck
' s
. actually
, tghe starbuck
' s thign gets even worse
.
and worse
. you won
' t fail tothe like mike
, howver
, played endearingly by jon favreau
. swingers revolves around mike
' s half
- hearted
and awkward efforts to get back in the social swing of things
. to this end he is enthusiastically assisted by his equally underachieving twentysomething acotr friends
, such as trent
( vince vaughn iwth thge film
' s most animated peformance
)
, who hasnt the igft of gab bordering on the disturbing side of motivational speaking
, gun
- toting sue
( patrick van horn
)
, anbd rob
( ron livingston
)
, who once played hamlet bu now longs to work as goofy infront disneyl
and
, bu doesn
' t succeed because of his lack of
" theme park experience
.
" together they talk about womens
- how to make eye contact
, which involves avoiding it
,
and when to call so as never to appear desperae
, twpo days being
" industry st
andard
.
" after talking the talk
, they walk tghe walk
, strutting like the cool swingers they aspire tothe be
, always to laughable effect
. to get mike out of his funk
, his friends persistently convince him tothe get outside
, whther it be to a quickie inght trip to a seedy vegas casino or a cutthroat hollywood party with the beautiful people or a 50s swing lounge
. everywhere they encourage mike to look for a replacement
" honey
"
and
then keep vigil over his progress
, or lack of it
. like dotty duting parents
, mike never leaves thier company wihtout bieng the recipient of their confidence cheerleading
(
" you
' re money
, mike
,
and the honeys knwo it
.
"
) or equipped with their eccentric dating philosophies
, such as an analogy of flirting iwth the bear
and thge bunny
. with the unwavering support of firends like theese
, maybe mike
' s nto doign too badly after all
. favreau also doubled as the film
' s screenwriter
,
and he proves he has the gfit for creating engaging characters
and witty banter thyat goes beyond today
' s bon mot
. there is a reassuring honesty to the friendships
, even when it hits its low points adn the friends commiserate
. whn mike gets the gumption to look for love
, ytou will join his cheerleading section as well
. swingers is light
, unassuming fare
, sweet c
andy ytou wiull want to bust your gut with
- laughing
- again
and again
