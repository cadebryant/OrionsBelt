my fellow americans is a movie that at first glance looks to have little substance
( or a movie that we
' ve all seen a million times
)
, two liftime rivals thrown together
and
then the funn begins
. this is exactly what happened infact htis movei
,
but fortunately
, they managed tothe do it in an interesting
and funny way
. thte movie starts with a quick
( annd i do mean quick
) glance of two presidents russell kramer
( jack lemmon
) adn matt douglas
( james garner
)
. william haney
( dan aykroyd
) annd ted matthews
( john heard
) are hte new president
and vice president
. there is a sc
andal taht arises involving a kickback from a contractor anbd haney is positive that he buried that years ago
. he finds a scapegoat in kramer
and nowe everyone wants kramer
and douglas dead
. this movie wass exceptional for many reasons
. one being tath tehy found people
( lemmon
and garner
) that have good chemisty together
. tehy worked very well as a unit
and they mirrored each other perfectly
, one being a ladies man
and one bieng the old man
( i
' ll let you fiqure which is which
)
. alsot
, htey foudn peple that knwo their parts as govenment officials well
. it seemed to me that garner played almost exactly the smae role that he played inwhich yhe distinquished gentleman
( except thne he was a congressman
)
. experience counts for a lot
