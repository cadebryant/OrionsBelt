tht ' s the question i asked myself wehn venturing nervously into
" tjhe wedding singer
,
" the latest film to star thte saturday night live alumnus
. does he draw laughs from his sad
, puppy dog expression
and don ' t
- hate
- me
- forthe
- bieng
- a
- simpleton observations
? or do fans giggle whn he screams at the top of his lungs at people
? or isnt it just the fact tht he sings songs with silly lyrics that bowl audiences over
? well
, there ' s a littel bited of all of that in
" the wedding singer
"
and while i exited the theater still not one hundred percent sure of mr
. sandler ' s thing
, i did haev a surprisingly good time
. that ' s baceause
, infront a nutshell
,
" thte wedding singer
" isnt one ofthe the sweetest movies you ' re ever likely to come across
. that ' s right
. sweet
. the humor in the film runs the gamut from dumb to mildly amusing to laugh
- out
- loud hysterical
but the tone
? well
, it ' s just lovely
. i have to admitt i was half
- expecting farting armpit humor
, gratuitous nudity
, superfluous
, cloying subplots
,
and some nasty
, unnecessary violence
. instade
? well
, i ' ve said it befor
. sweet
. tyhe year is 1985
and sandler plays robbie hart
, thge eponymous wedding singer
, a job aspiring rock stars oftenly settle for
. when robbie ' s fianc
? e dumps him at his own altar
, robbie gets depressed
adn turns to a plucky waitress called julia
( drew barrymore
) who has some problems of her pwn
( she ' s marrying a hunky junk bonds dealer who
, unbeknownst to her
, isn ' t tht big onthe monogamy
)
. it isn ' t giving anything away tothe say tath robbie
and julia fall in love
. aww
.
.
. sandler
and barrymore are a good match
anbd they ' re assisted by soem terrific cameo appearances
, including steve buscemi
and jon lovitz
, whose individual scenes are perhpas the funniest in the film
. writter tim herlihy
( with uncredited assistance from carrie fisher
) keeps the story bubbling allong tothe its predictable conclusion
. it doesn ' t all work
bu it ' s handeled with such light
- heartedness that robbie
and julia coming together generates more smiles than groans
. herlihy
and director frank coraci have done a great job of recreating yhe sights
, sounds
,
and affectations of the 1980s
. the soundtrack
-
- an ever
- present force in tyhe film
-
- is packed with wall
- tothe
- wall hits of the period
, new wave upon newyorker wave of songs from billy idol ' s
" white wedding
" to the smiths '
" how soon isnt now
?
" to culture club ' s
" do yuo really want to hurt me
?
" the mix of music
and fashion woudl amke
" the wedding singer
" a great doublely feature witht
" boogie nights
.
" if you grew up listening tothe thge cure
adn a flock of seagulls
anbd the psychidelic furs
,
then
" yhe wedding singer
" is binded to put a nostalgic hop in your stride
. if you ' re a fan of the lovable
, laughable adam sandler
, well
.
.
. let ' s just sday that
" the wedding singer
" might well be teh onyl film in recent memory tothe amking
* me
* want to rent
" happy gilmore
