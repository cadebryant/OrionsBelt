that
' s the question i asked mysef when venturing nervously into
" the wedding singer
,
" the latest film to star the saturday night live alumnus
. does he draw laughs from his sad
, puppy dog expression
and don
' t
- hate
- me
- for
- being
- a
- simpleton observations
? or do fans giggle when he screams at the top ofthe his lungs at people
? or is it just tyhe fact that he sings songs wtih silly lyrics that bowl audiences over
? well
, htere
' s a little bit ofthe all ofthe that in
" the wedding singer
"
and while i exited tyhe theather still nto one hundred percent sure of mr
. s
andler
' s thing
, i did have a surprisingly good tiem
. that
' s because
, infront a nutshell
,
" the wedding singer
" is one ofthe tjhe sweetest movies ytou
' re ever likely to come acrost
. that
' s right
. sweet
. tyhe humor in the film runs the gamut from dumb to mildly amusing to laugh
- out
- loud hysterical
but tjhe tone
? well
, it
' s just lovely
. i haev to admit i was half
- expecting farting armpit humor
, gratuitious nudity
, superfluous
, cloying subplots
,
and some nasty
, unnecessary violence
. instead
? well
, i
' ve said it befoer
. sweet
. the year is 1985 annd s
andler plays robbie hart
, the eponymous wedding singer
, a job aspiring rock stars oftenly settle for
. wehn robbie
' s fianc
? e dumps him at his own altar
, robbie gets depressed annd turns to a plucky waitress called julia
( drew barrymore
) who has smoe problems of her pwn
( she
' s marrying a hunky junk bonds dealer who
, unbeknownst to her
, isn
' t that big on monogamy
)
. it isn
' t giving anything away tothe say that robbie
and julia fall inspite lveo
. aww
.
.
. s
andler
and barrymore are a good match
and they
' re assisted by some terrific cameo appearances
, including steve buscemi
and jon lovitz
, whose individual scenes are perhaps thge funniest in yhe film
. writer tim herlihy
( with uncredited assistance from carrie fisher
) keeps the tsory bubbling along to its predictable conclusion
. it doesn
' t all work
but it
' s h
andeled with such light
- heartedness thgat robbie
and julia coming together generates more smiles than groans
. herlihy
and directer frank coraci have done a great job of recreating the sights
, sounds
,
and affectations ofthe tyhe 1980s
. the sountrack
-
- an ever
- present force infront the film
-
- is packed wiht wall
- to
- wall hits of tyhe period
, new wave upon new wave ofthe songs from billy idol
' s
" white wedding
" to the smiths
'
" how soon is nowe
?
" tothe culture club
' s
" do ytou really want tothe hurt me
?
" the mix of music
and fashion would make
" tyhe wedding singer
" a great double feature wtih
" boogie nights
.
" if you growed up listening to the cure
and a flock ofthe seagulls adn the psychedelic furs
, thne
" the wedding singer
" is bound to put a nostalgic hop in your stride
. if you
' re a fan of the lovable
, laughable adam s
andler
, well
.
.
. let
' s just say that
" hte wedding singer
" might well be the only film in recent memmory tothe make
* me
* want to rent
" happy gilmore
.
