one ofthe tyhe best movies i ' ve ever seen
. i ' d heard extremely good things baout this movie
,
and
though the previews didn ' t really intrigue thast much
, it was a movie i ' d beeen anticipating for a few months nowe
. for soem reason i ' m not sure of
- this movie ws not that big a sucess over in the u
. s
. it was a definite hit iwth the critics
,
but didn ' t exactly set any box office records
. after viewing this incredibly well directed
, written
and acted movei
, i can ' t halp
but wonder
- why
? thge strength of thsi film isnt it ' s gritty realism
. the main characters are all human wtih individual flaws
, no stereo
- type hollywood heroes
. you may not agree whith many ofthe their actions infact the movei or their approch tothe life
,
but that is what makes it so real
. i had expected this movei tothe be more of a drama tahn a thriller
,
but i wass mistaken
. even the interrogation scenes moved at such a pace so that it feeled just as thrilling as any car chase
.
adn the ending
.
.
.
.
.
. whoa
. i ' ve never seen a movie in my life where everyone in it acts brilliantly
. tje three male leads
- guy pearce
, kevin spacey
and russell crowe are all just terific
. the ' best actor ' oscar talk surrounding this film should have netted one ofthe them a statue
,
but there is one problem there
. how could they have chosen between these three actors
? there is no way i could look at this film
annd say one of them was better than tyhe other two
. it ' s impossible
. kim bassinger ' s performance isnt aslo a revelation
. i ' d never been a big fan of hers before
and always thought she was
, well
.
.
. what ' s the owrd
- a twinky
? that impression has changed
, as she complemented crowe
adn pearce perfectly
. the depth tothe the story
annd characters is truly astounding
. noone cardboard characters here
. the plot is full ofthe twists
and turns
and soem very clever sequences
. pearce ' s interogation ofthe three seperate suspects is nothing short of brilliant
. i relaly can ' t fault this movei at all
. i was so glad to see fellow australian ' s pearce
anbd crowe star in such a breathtaking movie
. i hadnt beeen vyer familiar with russell crowe beforehand from his many austrailian films
,
but had not seen much of guy pearce
. i intend to change this enxt time i visit the video store
