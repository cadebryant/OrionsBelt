one of the best movies i
' ve ever seen
. i
' d heard extremly good things about tihs movie
,
and
though the previews didn
' t really intrigue that much
, it wass a movie i
' d beeen anticipating for a fewd monthes nowe
. for some reason i
' m nto sure of
- this movie was nto that big a sucess over in the u
. s
. it was a deffinite hit with the critics
,
but didn
' t exactly set any box office records
. after viewing this incredibly well directed
, writed
and acted movie
, i can
' t help
but wonder
- why
? the strength of this film is it
' s gritty realism
. the main characters are all human with individule flaws
, noone stereo
- type hollywood heroes
. you may not agree with many ofthe thier actions in the movei or their approach to life
, bu thast is what makse it so real
. i had expeced this movie tothe be more ofthe a drama than a thriller
, bu i was mistaken
. even the interrogation scenes moved at such a pace so that it felt just as thrilling as any car chase
.
and hte endig
.
.
.
.
.
. whoa
. i
' ve never seen a movie in my life where everyone in it acts brilliantly
. the three male leads
- guy pearce
, kevin spacey
and russell crowe are all jsut terific
. the
' best actor
' oscar talk surrouding this film should have netted one of them a statue
, bu there is one problem there
. how could tehy have chosen between theese threee actors
? ther isnt noone way i could look at this film annd say one of them was better than the other two
. it
' s impossible
. kim bassinger
' s performance is alsot a revelation
. i
' d never been a big fan ofthe hers before
and always thougth she was
, well
.
.
. what
' s hte word
- a twinky
? that impression hasnt changed
, as she complemented crowe anbd pearce perfectly
. the depth to the story annd characters is truly astounding
. noone cardboard characters here
. the plot is full of twists
and turns
and soem very clever sequences
. pearce
' s interogation ofthe three seperate suspects is nothing short of brilliant
. i really can
' t fault this movie at all
. i was so glad to see fellow australian
' s pearce
and crowe star in such a breathtaking movie
. i hadnt beeen very familiar with russell crowe beforeh
and from his many australian films
, bu had not seen much of guy pearce
. i intend to change thsi next timne i visit the video store
