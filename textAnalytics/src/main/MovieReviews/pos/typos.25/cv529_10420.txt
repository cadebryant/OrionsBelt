. if there
' s ever been an exception to tghe perils of excessive cliches
and non
- stop action
, tyhe james bond films are it
.
and if there
' s ever beeen a james bond film that not only proves this
, bu does so by pushing it to thte extreme
,
" tomorrow never dies
" is it
. opening sequences almost allways mkea or break acation films
. whn done propperly
, nto onyl are they acutally exciting
,
but they foreshadow thigsn to come
. this film starts off onthe tje right foot by establishing the kind ofthe atmosphere tht could onyl be found in an acation movie
, bu wiht a sense ofthe the self
- aware
, enclosed universe where james bond movies take place infront
. first there
' s a high
- tech
, slightly complicated scene involving a british warship crossing into unfriendly
, chinese waters
. ther
' s efinite tension as ther seems to be an unknown
,
but certainly hostile
, third party involved who isnt manipulating both sides
. when the scene ends inwhich tragedy
, it
' s clear there
' s some kind of powerful conspiracy going onthe
,
and who else to call on for such a case
but james bond
? the film uses ogod judgment in the way it introduces us to bond
( brosnon
)
. as the enemy was portrayed as evil anbd misterious
, bond is clearly
(
and obviously
) depicted as an outloud
- annd
- out hero
. he single
- h
andedly tkaes out a small army of terrorists
,
and thne must excape in the nick of time by flying awya in a fighter jet while the co
- pilot tries tothe strangle him
and a terrorist infront anohter jet tries to shoot him down
! this might soudn liek the kind ofthe cliches films like this are notorious forthe
( over
-
) using
,
but it works here because the film knows how tothe git our attention quickly
. it
' s nto about tjhe payoff because it
' s obvious bond will escape
, instead
, it
' s the way it processes teh action sequences by going over the top
and nto apologizing for it
, all the while creating forthe witty
, hysterical comedy
. it seems less emphasis isnt placed on the villains in thrillers anymore
, because of political correctness
,
and jsut plain copping
- out on behalf of the filmmakers
( even the term
" villain
" sounds passe
)
. what the film deserves kudos fo is its ability to create a villain as heinous as tehy cmo
,
yet making him seem completely plausible
. jonathon pryce delivers a perfect peformance as the arrogant
, cunning elliot carver
, a media mogul whose goal is tothe take over the world
, tyhat isnt
, through his massive media empire
, not through nuclear weapons
. through some intresting detective work
, bond
and thge english minstry of defense believe carver is behind the trouble brewing in the southern asian seas as a way to create anbd accurately cover his own news
. not only is that an original idea for a conflict
, bu one which could carry over inot reality
. suprisingly
, this is about as detailed as the story allows the specific plot to become
. the film
' s hook isnt hte acation
, annd of course thsoe kool gadgets
and we get plenty of that here as bond goes out to investigate carver
and finds himself in a jam or two along the way
. the story works much like bond himself
- always on the run
and concentrates more on the individual conflicts thna any genaral plot
. somehow a chineese agent
, wai lin
( yeoh
)
, bumps into bond a few too many times
and they find themselves working toghether
. tghe chemistry between brosnon
and yeoh isnt rigid
,
but also works because ofthe this
, not in spite ofthe it
. the two are constanly onthe tjhe run from carver
and his goons
,
yet the film manages tothe balance the stunts annd special effects with its clever story
.
al
though
" tomorrow never dies
" is far from perfect
, it is qutie an impressive film in terms ofthe its abillity to be so cliche
and cartoony
and not make plausibility an issue
.
