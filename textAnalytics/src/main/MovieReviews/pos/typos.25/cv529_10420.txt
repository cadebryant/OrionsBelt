. if there ' s ever been an exception to the perils ofthe excessive cliches
and non
- stpo action
, tje james bond films are it
.
and if there ' s ever beeen a james bond film that not only proves this
,
but does so by pushing it to the extreme
,
" tomorrow never dies
" is it
. opening sequences almost always amking or break action films
. when done properly
, not onyl are tehy actually exciting
,
but they foreshadow things to come
. thsi film starts off on hte right foot by establishing teh kind ofthe athmosphere thast could onyl be found in an acation movie
,
but with a sense of yhe self
- aware
, enclosed universe where james bond movies take palce in
. first htere ' s a high
- tech
, slightly complicated scene involving a british warship crossing inot unfriendly
, chinese waters
. htere ' s definite tension as there seems to be an unkown
,
but certainly hostile
, thrid party involved who is manipulating both sides
. when the scene ends infront tradgedy
, it ' s clear there ' s some kind ofthe powerful conspiracy goign on
,
adn who eles to call on fo such a case
bu james bond
? the film uses ogod judgment in tjhe way it introduces us to bond
( brosnon
)
. as thge enemy was portrayed as evil
and mysterous
, bond is clearly
(
annd obviously
) depicted as an out
-
and
- out hero
. he single
- handedly takes out a small army of terrorists
,
and
then must escape in thge nick of timne by flying away in a fighter jet while the co
- pilot tries to strangle him
adn a terrorist in anyother jet tries to shoot him down
! this might sound like the kind of cliches films liek this are notorious for
( over
-
) using
,
but it works here because the film knows how to get our attention quickly
. it ' s nto baout the payoff baceause it ' s obvious bond will excape
, instade
, it ' s the way it processes the action sequences by going over teh top
adn not apologizing for it
, all the while creating for witty
, hysterical comedy
. it seems less emphasis is placed onthe the villains inthe thrillers anymore
, because of political correctness
,
and jsut plain copping
- out on behalf ofthe the filmmakers
( even the term
" villain
" sounds passe
)
. whta the film deserves kudos for is its ability tothe create a villain as heinous as they come
,
yet making him seem completely plausible
. jonathon pryce delivers a perfect peformance as tyhe arrogant
, cunning elliot carver
, a media mogul whose gool is to take over thte world
, that is
, through his massive media empire
, nto thru nucular weapons
. through some interesting detective work
, bond
and the english ministry of defense believe carver is behind the trouble brewing in the southern aisian seas as a way tothe create
and accurately cover his pwn news
. not onyl is that an original idea forthe a conflict
,
bu one whitch could carry over into reality
. surprizingly
, tihs is about as detailled as the story allows the specific plot to become
. the film ' s hook isnt the acation
,
and ofthe course those kool gadgets
and we get plenty ofthe that here as bond goes out to investigate carver
and finds himself in a jam or two allong the way
. the stopry works much like bond himselv
- allways on the run
annd concentrates mroe on the individual conflicts than any general plot
. somehow a chinese agent
, wai lin
( yeoh
)
, bumps into bond a few too many times
and they find themselfs wroking together
. the chemestry between brosnon
annd yeoh isnt rigid
,
bu also works becuase of htis
, not inaddition spite of it
. the twpo are constantly on the run ffrom carver
and his goons
,
yet tje film manages to balance the stunts
and special effects with its clever tsory
.
although
" tommorow never dies
" is far ffrom perfect
, it isnt qtuie an impressive film in terms ofthe its ability to be so cliche
and cartoony
and not make plausibility an issue
.
