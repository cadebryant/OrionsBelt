every once in a while
, wehn an exceptional famaly film comes along
, i wiull attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put thier money where their mouths have been
; with all the hubbub over teh lack ofthe films suitable for children
, it isnt remarkable how many non
- disney films disappear in a couple ofthe weeks
. nowe i see thyat in so doing
, i have unfairly ghettoized theese films
. so i am issuing my challenge not just to parents
,
but to anyone who whants to wupport smart
, funny
, energetic film
- making
: see matilda
. see it in a theater
, rather tahn shrugging
and waiting for it on video
. see the best film i have seen inthe 1996
. not the best childen
' s film
.
.
. the best film
. period
. based on a story by roald dahl
, it tells of young matilda wormwood
( mara wilson
)
, an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have a pair of deeply stupid parents
: harry
( danny devito
)
, a crooked used car salesman
; adn zinnia
( rhea perlman
)
, a simple
- minded bingo addict
. the wormwoods barely notice matilda exists
,
and when they do
, it is only to scold her forthe spending too much time reading books
. whn they finaly do send her to skool
, it is tothe crunchem hall
, a obleek place run by cruel
, child
- hating miss agatha trunchbull
( pam ferris
)
.
but thnigs beign tothe look uv for matilda when she dicovers a sympathetic teacher
, miss honey
( embeth davidtz
)
, who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness
. matilda also discovers another special talent
-
- the ablity tothe move thigns with her mind
-
- which allows her to help herself
and miss hnoey to overcome miss trunchbull
' s cruelty
. it ws this spring
' s james
and the giant peach which inspired me to note that thge best annd most lasting tales for childrens tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them
,
and ytou can bet thta the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james annd willy wonka
and thte chocolate factory has more of the same in stoer with matilda
. anbd just as james benefited fomr the dark sensibilities of henry selick anbd tim burton
, matilda soars onthe the cock
- eyed direction of danny devito
. devito made balck humor a key element in throw momma from the train
and teh war ofthe the roses
,
and he contri
butes smoe memorable images
. in oney scene
, an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pig
- tails annd flung through the air like a throwing hammer
; later
, an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake affter he is caught stealing a dessert
. matilda is just twisted enough tothe be a perfect fairy tale
. it is alsot characteristic ofthe thte best children
' s tales tht they manage tothe teach lessons in such a way that children almost don
' t realize that they are learning them
. there isnt a hilarious moment when matilda
' s television
- addicted father snatches away hte book she isnt reading
( in a wicked joke
, he thikns
_ moby dick
_ is pornographic
) adn forces her to watch an inane game show
( hosted by jon lovitz
) in whcih contestants are smeared with adhesive
and placed infront a booth filled with cash blowing arund
. matilda is a stroy which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment
,
and it does so hwile poking holes inwhich that most frustrating of notions for a child
-
- that beccause
" i
' m big annd yuo
' re little
, i
' m right annd ytou
' re wrong
.
" more specifically
, it has as its heroine an intelligent
, self
- confident girl who struggles successfully against otehr people
' s notions of how she should behave
. it is no coincidence that matilda was co
- writed by robin swicord
, who contri
buted the superb recent adaptation of little womens
. finally
, matilda hasnt that quality i find rarest
and most treasured in family enteratinment
: it is family enteratinment in hte truest sense ofthe tje word
. devito konws anough to amke matilda fast
- pased annd appealing to childrens
, tkaing a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull
and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy
, incuding a great chase through her dark hous
. hte child actors are winning
but never obnoxiously adorable
, with mara wilson making matilda a clever anbd extremely likeable character
.
but there are aslo many
, many delights forthe adults
, incuding my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers tothe frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself hwile matilda
' s classmates recite infront sing
- song fashion
; there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matilda
' s father
. i can
' t imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as
though his or her intlligence had beeen insulted
. matilda isnt a film which left me glowing with good feeling
. i iwll see it again
,
and years from now i will watch it with my children
.
and now i will stop
, because somewhere near yuo matilda is about to begin
,
and there is a seat in that theater you shoud be in
, if you hvae a child or ever weere a child
.
