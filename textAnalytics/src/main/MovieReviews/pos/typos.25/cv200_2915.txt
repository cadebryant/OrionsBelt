a common complaint amongst film criticists is
" why aren
' t there moreso literate scripts availaible
?
" quiz show gives signs ofthe hope thyat the art of writing isn
' t dead inspite hollywood
and that we need not only look to independent films for
thoughtful content
. paul attanasio
' s script takes whta could ahev been a tepid thriller
( the quiz sohw sc
andals of yhe late 50s
)
and delivers a telling parable about the emptiness ofthe yhe post war american dream
and the golden bubble thyat surrounds anbd protects tv networks
and their sponsors
. the film is riddled wih telling symbols
( e
. g
. a
' 58 chrysler
, a radio announcement ofthe sputnik
)
but is never heavy h
anded
. deft direction by robert redford
and keen performances by ralph fiennes
, john turturro
and rob morrow dovetail perfectly with the carefully honed script
. redford departs fomr the usualy overlight
,
" cable tv quality
" sets
and camera work so common in recent 20th centruy preriod pieces
. quiz show perfectly captures the colors
and textures of the eisenhower years
.
al
though i was only 4 eyars old when the
" twenty one
" sc
andal broke
, enough of tje 50s icons survivied throughtout my childhood for me tothe recogise the au
thenticity of redford
' s alomst tangible pallete
. from plastic covered furniture tothe carefully coifed contestants
, the images ring true from that era ofthe rampant consumerism
, ofthe a generation tyhat had gone thru 15 years of depression
and world war without
" disposable income
,
" before the manifestation ofthe its american dream
. the film deftly weaves several themes toghether
, from assimilation
and exclusion of jews ffrom
" thte good life
,
" to the lengths that a scion ofthe a literary family iwll go to to match his father
' s fame
.
though the 50s audience that is
" rocked
" by this sc
andal may initialy seem naieve tothe us
, they should appear all too familiar
, iwth our current national passion forthe yhe ries
and fall of icons like michael jackson or tonya harding
. charles van doren annd herbie stemple were the overnight mega celebrities of thier day
. the tv audience is almsot a fourth main carachter
, alwyas at the center of the decisions bieng made onthe theri behalf
. at yhe film
' s end
, the credits roll past slow motion footage ofthe taht same 50s tv audience
, mindlessly laughing at some piece of fluff
. like thge distorted mirror that captued a blurred swastika at yhe end of cabaret
, this
" mirror
" may reflect an image we
' re nto all that comfortable with
.
