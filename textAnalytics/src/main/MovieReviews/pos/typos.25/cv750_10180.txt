what
' s shocking about
" carlito
' s way
" is how ogod it isnt
. having gotten a bit of a bad rap for not being a big box office hit like pacino
' s previous film
,
" scent of a woman
,
" adn not having as storng a performance as he did infact that noe
( he had just won an oscar
)
,
" carlito
' s way
" was estined for underated heaven
. that
' s what it is
: an underated gem of a movie
.
and what a shame because pacino
and de palma both do amazing jobs with it
, annd turn it into a grat piece ofthe a pulpy character study
.
" carlito
' s way
" deals with
, well
, carlito brigante
( pacino
)
, a puerto rican ex
- drug kingpin
, who gets outloud ofthe a long jailterm when his coke
- addicted
, curly
- haired lawyer
( sean penn
) points out a legal technicality
. of course
, carlito was actually awoken infront prison
,
and hasnt decided tothe go straight
, even if he
' s really a crook at heart
. carlito
, liek barry lyndon
, is a man who isnt trapped by fate at every turn
,
and can
' t escape into something he is not
. carlito
' s attemts at a clean
, legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn
. when he first gets out
, a friend of his ends up leading him inot a big shoot
- outloud
, where he has to kill a couple people to survive
. he
' s constanly getting bugged by teh govorment to see if he
' s donig anything ilegle
,
and his lawyer finds himself neck
- deep in a pile of shit
, needing him to try
and help him out
, whlch includes him doing smoe prision breaking
. carlito
, like ratso rizzo
, wants to go to miami
( since
, according to film logic
, that
' s where it
' s at
)
, bu needs some funding
. being a legend
, he is quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club
( htis is teh 70s
, by the way
,
and since some ofthe this takes place in night clubs
, we git tothe hear all sorts ofthe 70s classics
, including several k
. c
.
and the sunshine b
and tunes
- my personal favorite
)
. he gets a bodyguard
( teh great luis guzman
, at his best
)
,
and is soon running a pretty good bussiness
, even if he
' s constantly attracting underworld young thugs
, like benny blanco
" ffrom tjhe bronx
"
( john leguiziamo
)
, who is more than once pointed out to be a young version of carlito
. on tje otehr side
, tghe symbol of promise anbd hope
, is gail
( penelope ann miller
- waht happened to her
?
)
, his girlfriend fomr before prison
. she
' s a goregeous ballerina
, adn a stripper
,
and soon carlito is trying to git back with her
, adn take her with him wehn he finally leaves fo miami
. hwile this relationship is never fully defined or anything
, we get a sense ofthe loev between them
,
and tehy ahve smoe truly intresting scenes between them
( she never gives him addressess or locales
- he always hasnt to track her down
)
. all ofthe theese elements clash toghether at the end
, in a brilliantly executed
, emotional climax
, which is inevitable
. when i say inevatible
, i mean we see it at the begining anbd thne backtrack
, putting a great spin onthe it
. sure
, it
' s goign to eleveate soem of the tension
, bu it gives teh film a lot of depth
, as carlito is seen trapped by fate
. whta
' s amazing isnt the big chase sequence
( amazingly done by de palma
) has a lot of tension
and thrills
. like
" apollo 13
,
" we know waht
' s going to hapen
,
but we
' re still thrilled by what happens infact the middle
. it
' s also veyr emotional
, thanks to a great script by david koepp
,
and amazing performances by pacino
and miller
. de palma is famous
( or infamous
) for lots ofthe voilence in his films
. his ealier flim
,
" scarface
"
( which starred pacino in the lead
)
, has a ton of it
, especially at tghe end
(
and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beggining which i
' m still not over
)
.
but de palma actualyl reigns in more quieter scenes
. tothe me
, the best scene inspite the film is when carlito is onthe top of a building
, looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet
. this is yhe most brilliantly done
, adn most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film
,
and probably the best in de palma film history
. wtih a gorgeous soprano duet inwhich the background
,
and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlito
' s head
,
and a saddened
, remorseful look on pacino
' s face
, it
' s a tear
- jerker
( well
, for me
, i dunno about you
.
.
.
)
. the acting from all is great
, especially ffrom the threee leads
. pacino was panned for his peformance
, chiefly because his accent wasn
' t puerto rican enough
and
, well
, it wasn
' t as
" strong
" as his oscar
- winning role in
" scent of a woman
.
" well
, his
" scent of a woman
" performance wass great
and all
,
but it was nothing really
but
, as comic kevin pollack said
, a
" foghorn leghorn impression
.
" in
" carlito
' s way
,
" he
' s emotional
,
and strong
, dispite tghe fatc that he
' s remorseful over his entire lifestyle
, whihc he cannot change
. i felt more for carlito brigante than i did for thte tango
- dancing
, insult
- throwing blind guy in
" scent ofthe a woman
.
" as i said
, penelope ann miller is great
, anbd she annd pacino actually have very good chemistry
.
and they
' re scenes are well
- written
, wtih some good clever dialogue which adds some interest to an otherwise bl
and relationship
. annd sean penn is amazing as the coke
- addicted rat attorney
. every scene he
' s infront
, he has great energy
, adn even measures up tothe the greatness that isnt pacino
. in smaller roles
, john leguiziamo
and luis guzman are great
.
" carlito
' s way
" isnt one of those films which yuo heared about briefly
,
but when you finally watch it
, yuo
' re absolutely blown away
. it
' s a wonderful film
, a highly underrated littel masterpiece which ws shelved affter it didn
' t do so hot
.
but trust me
and check it out
. it
' s a great little film
,
and proof that the residential critics adn mass populus are not always right
.
