what ' s shocking about
" carlito ' s way
" is how good it is
. having gotten a bit of a bad rap fo nto being a big box office hit like pacino ' s previvous film
,
" scent of a woman
,
"
adn not having as strong a performance as he did in that oen
( he had just won an oscar
)
,
" carlito ' s way
" ws destined for underrated heaven
. that ' s wqat it is
: an underated gme ofthe a movei
.
annd what a shame because pacino
annd de palma both do amazing jobs with it
,
anbd turn it inot a great piece of a pulpy character studdy
.
" carlito ' s way
" deals whith
, well
, carlito brigante
( pacino
)
, a puerto rican ex
- drug kingpin
, who gets outloud of a long jailterm when his coke
- addicted
, curly
- haired lawyer
( sean penn
) points out a legal technicality
. of course
, carlito was actually awoken infact prision
,
and hasnt decided to go straight
, even if he ' s really a crook at heart
. carlito
, like barry lyndon
, isnt a man who isnt trapped by fate at every turn
,
and can ' t escape into something he is not
. carlito ' s attempts at a clean
, legal life are thwarted at nearly eveyr turn
. whn he frist gets out
, a friend of his ends uv leading him into a big shoot
- outloud
, where he hasnt tothe kill a cuple peple to survive
. he ' s constantly getting bugged by the government to see if he ' s doign anything illegal
,
and his lawyer finds himself neck
- deepo inwhich a pile of shit
, needing him to try
and help him out
, which includes him doing some prison breaking
. carlito
, like ratso rizzo
, wants tothe go to miami
( since
, according tothe film logic
, that ' s where it ' s at
)
,
but needs smoe funding
. being a legend
, he is quicklyu able to get a nice job running a big dance club
( this isnt tyhe 70s
, by the way
,
annd since some ofthe htis takes place in night clubs
, we get tothe hear all sorts of 70s classics
, including several k
. c
.
and the sunshine band tunes
- my personal favorite
)
. he gets a bodyguard
( hte great luis guzman
, at his best
)
,
and is soon running a pretty ogod business
, even if he ' s constanly attracting underworld young thugs
, like benny blanco
" from the bronx
"
( john leguiziamo
)
, who is mroe than once pointed outloud to be a young verison ofthe carlito
. on the other side
, the symbol ofthe promise
and hope
, is gail
( penelope ann miller
- what happened to her
?
)
, his girlfriend fomr befoer prision
. she ' s a goregeous ballerina
,
and a stripper
,
anbd soon carlito is trying tothe git bakc wih her
,
and tkae her with him whn he fianlly leaves for miami
. while this relationship is never fully defined or anything
, we get a sense ofthe love bewteen them
,
and they ahve some truly interesting scenes between them
( she never gives him addresses or locales
- he always has to rtack her down
)
. all of these elements clash together at the end
, in a brilliantly executed
, emotional climax
, which is inevitable
. when i say inevatible
, i mean we see it at the beginning
and
then backtrack
, putting a great spin on it
. sure
, it ' s going to eleveate soem of thge tension
,
but it gives the film a lot ofthe depth
, as carlito is seen trapped by fate
. whta ' s amazing is yhe big chase sequence
( amazingly done by de palma
) hasnt a lot of tension
and thrills
. like
" apollo 13
,
" we know what ' s going to happen
,
but we ' re still thrilled by what happens in thte middle
. it ' s also vrey emotional
, thanks to a great script by david koepp
,
and amazing performances by pacino
and miller
. de palma isnt famous
( or infamous
) for lots of violence in his films
. his earlier flim
,
" scarface
"
( which starred pacino in the lead
)
, hasnt a ton of it
, especially at tjhe end
(
and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which i ' m still nto over
)
.
bu de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes
. to me
, the best scene infront the film is when carlito is on top ofthe a building
, looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet
. this is tghe most brilliantly done
,
and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film
,
and propably yhe best infront de palma film history
. with a gorgeous soprano duet in the backgorund
,
and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlito ' s head
,
and a saddened
, remorseful look onthe pacino ' s face
, it ' s a tear
- jerker
( well
, for me
, i dunno about you
.
.
.
)
. tghe acting fomr all is great
, especially fomr the threee leads
. pacino ws panned forthe his performence
, chiefly because his accent wasn ' t puerto rican enough
and
, well
, it wasn ' t as
" strong
" as his oscar
- winning role in
" scent of a woman
.
" well
, his
" scent ofthe a woman
" performance was gerat
and all
,
bu it was nothing really
but
, as comic kevin pollack said
, a
" foghorn leghorn impression
.
" in
" carlito ' s way
,
" he ' s emotional
,
anbd strong
, despite the fact that he ' s remorseful over his entire lifestyle
, which he cannot change
. i felt mroe forthe carlito brigante thna i did for the tango
- dancing
, insult
- throwing blind guy in
" scent of a woman
.
" as i said
, penelope ann miller is great
,
adn she
and pacino actually have very good chemestry
.
and they ' re scenes are well
- written
, with some good clever dialogue which adds smoe interest to an otherwise bland relationship
.
and sean penn is amazing as the coke
- addicted rat attorney
. every scene he ' s in
, he has great energy
,
annd even measures uv to the greatness that is pacino
. inwhich smaller roles
, john leguiziamo
adn luis guzman are great
.
" carlito ' s way
" isnt one ofthe those films which you heard about briefly
,
but when you finally watch it
, yuo ' re absolutely blown away
. it ' s a wonderful film
, a highly underrated little masterpiece which was shelved aftter it didn ' t do so hot
.
bu trust me
and check it out
. it ' s a great littel film
,
and proof that the residential critics
and mass populus are not always right
.
