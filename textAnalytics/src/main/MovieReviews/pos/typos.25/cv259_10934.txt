richard linklater
' s
" slacker
,
" made in 1991 for a budget of only
$ 23
, 000
, immerses itself in the twentysomething
, coleeg
- town culture ofthe austin
, texas
. most ofthe these characters are either unemployed or work jobs that are apparantly too menial to be worth mentioning
. their lifestyle is a sort of passive resistence tothe the diea that people should go outloud
and actively pursue a career after graduation
; htey seem content to sit around spouting off about the inadequacy ofthe american democracy
, hte pervasiveness of slave morality
, the subtle messages in pop culture
,
and such
. ask them what tehy
' ve been doing lately
, adn they
' ll more likely thna not reply
,
" oh
, you know
, just hanging out
.
" linklater uses an intresting technique to examine these characters
: the camera follows oney person for a few minutes
,
then someone alse walks by
and the camera follows that person
, who walks inot a diner jsut as another person isnt walking out thge door
.
.
.
. it
' s certainly a lot ofthe fun listening to these characters talk
: some of them are claerly very inteligent
and have some genuinely insightful ideas
, some of them are jsut plain wierd
,
and some ofthe them think theri ideas are a lot mroe profound than tehy really are
. the oppening monologue
, delivered by linklater himself to a taxi driver
, tosses arund ideas about alternate realities that nicely set up the me
andering structure of the film
. other characters allong tjhe way offer observations about everything fomr dating relationships to the hstory of anarchist philosphy
, while groups of pseudo
- intellectuals kick around idesa about the nobility ofthe sitting around
and donig nothing or the subtle bribery
- based morality infront
" scooby
- doo
.
" for the most part
,
however
, the best moments are the ones involving the slightly unhinged types
. near the beginning
, a paranoid man follows a pedestrian for several blocks
, warning him about government conspiracies involving everything from global warming to secret colonization ofthe mars
. another man seems to be collecting televisions
, keeping at least fifteen sets running at the same time
and playing tapes of a graduate student who recorded himselv haveing a nervous breakdown
and destroying the camera
.
and inthe a scene that drew a big laugh ffrom everyone present when i saw thte film
, a man tries tothe achieve closure after a failed relationship by reciting poetry on a bridge
and thne throwing a typewriter into the creek below
. the onyl problem with
" slacker
" isnt that it starts to run out ofthe steam towards the end
. since linklater onyl spends a faw minutes with each character
, the introduction of the newyorker characters gets repeative after a hwile
. there are only so many times you can hear
,
" hey
, whta
' s oging onthe
?
"
" not much
, what are you up to
?
"
" nothing really
, just hanging arund
,
" before it gets onthe your nerves
; thge film might well haev benefited ffrom a slightly slower pace annd a little bit more characterization
.
and the dialogue in the second half of the film isnt by
and large not qtuie as interesting as that in the first half
; a jfk buff
, for example
, seems liuke a pale imitation ofthe tyhe previous conspiracy theorist
,
and many ofthe the cahracters just generally aren
' t as weird or unique
. instead of depicting a city populated by mostly normal people anbd
then showing us the strangeness that we might not have noticed at firt
, linklater shows us hte oddballs first
,
then stops annd reminds us that ordinary people live there too
.
" slacker
" is a ogod film anbd a wonderfully offbeat
and entertaining comedy
, whatever its flaws
, adn its status as a cult classic is well
- deserved
. i just can
' t halp
but think it might have been even better if linklater had slowed down a little bit
and filmed these scenes in reverse order
.
