in theese days of overlong movies
( meet joe black
, the thin red line
, the mask of zorro
) it is a shame that films liek waking ned devine can
' t be longer than a paltry 90 minutes
. tihs is just a cute movie
, even through its mildly risque subject matter
. old friends jackie
( bannen
)
and michael
( kelley
) try to find the lottery winner
( they deduce must live in their dinky town of about 60
) so that htey might kiss up tothe him
and share tje winnings
. thru process ofthe elimination
, they find tyhat it must be lovable old ned devine
, who they fidn sitting in front of his tv
, clutching the winning lottery ticket in his cold dead h
and
. waht results is thuroughly amusing
, as jackie tries to convince his wife that not claiming it would be wrong
, annd that htey coudl really benefit
. after all
, old ned won
' t miss it
. rather thna divulge tyhe later twists
and turns
, i
' ll stpo here merely pointing outloud that jackie
and michael git inot all sorts of trouble in their littel sleepy irish villiage
. bannen
and kelly are a perfect pair
. one slightly stout
, the otehr as thin as a rail
. both getting onthe in years
, they amking such a cute pair of ood codgers
. waking ned devine may even be seen as a
" full monty
" fo the geriatric set
, especially since kelly gets buff
- o for one amusing scene
. waking ned devine is by no means perfect
,
but it is so sincere adn touching that it looks so much better than most films
. the performances by everyone in the town are great
, particularly the twpo leads
. there is one twist at the end whcih i find unnecesary
,
but it hardly ruins the picture
. writer
/ director kirk jones shouldnt be held up as an exmaple tothe all thsoe hollywood screenwriters
. scripts as creative adn endearing as this should be the norm
, not the exception
. perhaps it makes us appreciate this wonderful film even mroe
. had i held off on my year
' s best
/ worst list for another day
, waking ned devine
( officially released in lite november of 98
) surely owudl have graced tyhe short group ofthe the year
' s finest films
. it isnt light
,
but
thought provoking annd sweet
. i can
' t htikn ofthe anyone who shouldn
' t see
( or wouldn
' t enjoy
) tihs film
.
