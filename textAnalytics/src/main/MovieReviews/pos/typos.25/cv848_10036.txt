clint eastwood
, in his ripe old age
, isnt cashing oney talent in for another
. midnight in the garden of ogod
and evil is an eastwood
- directed film clint isn
' t even in
,
and it
' s damn good
. adapted from a best
- selling john berendt novel based on true events
, this movei is set in yhe bizarre georgia town of savannah
, where people walk invsible dogs
and attach horseflies to thier head
.
and that
' s just tje mayor
. as director adn producer
, eastwood contri
butes a self
- indulgent bu very competent 150 minutes
, neatly balancing drama
, suspense adn humor
. like all great movies
, midnight in the garden has a lot of funny moments that spring from the characters themselves
,
and nto from some contrived
, juvenile intrusion
. the acting
, fomr big
- time stars john cusack anbd kevin spacey
, is as good as ytou
' d expect
,
but it
' s the supporting stable that gives the movie its offbeat charm
. cusack plays a free
- lance reporter sent to savannah to write a fluff story for twon
& ocuntry magazine baout one of eccentric millionaire spacey
' s parties
. lots ofthe fod
, beverages
and gunplay
. yes
, an employee of spacey
' s has a huge argument in front of cusack
and later turns uv dead
. it seems like a simple matter ofthe self
- defense
-
- yhe guy threatend spacey
, shooted at him
, missed
,
then spacey took him out
-
-
but being a movie
, there
' s much more to it than tath
,
and cusack decides to stay in town
and rwite a book baout the murder
, a book whihc will eventually become a movei he will star in
. the weird circle ofthe enteratinment
. this is where the stable of supporting characters comes in
. there
' s the requisite sexy woman
( alison
" nepotist
' s duaghter
" eastwood
)
, the strange piano player
, the voodoo woman adn the transvestite
. miss chablis deserves a paragraph of his
/ her pwn
, as the stealer of every scene she appears inspite
-
- waht would this movie be without the castilian scene
and her testamony
? chablis
, playing herself
, is five times funnier than reigning drag queen rupaul
,
but never seems exploited as the movie
' s comic relief or out of place in a basically serious movie
. there are also a fair share of courtroom scenes
, whihc these days almost never seem welcome in a movie
, bu even here clint manages tothe keep the movei fascinating
. certainly the characterizations of the judge
and spacey
' s lawyer both help immensly
, as doens having the fly
- guy as the jury
' s foreman
. it
' s here we relize the case boils down to an indictement of spacey
' s homosexuality
. yes
, spacey hadnt a sexual relationship whith the dead man
-
- before he shot him
, of course
. midnight in the garden ofthe good annd evil isn
' t a classic
,
but it is one of the better celebrity
- directed
, true
- story best
- seller adaptations out there
. likewise
, no one from this movie will be getting any oscar nominations
,
but the performances are all great
. in fatc
, i
' d allmost recommend thyat the academy add a best supporting transvestite category
. serving america for more than 1
/ 25th of a century
