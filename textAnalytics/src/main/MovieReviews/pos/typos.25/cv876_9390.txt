ususally when one is debating who tjhe modern queen ofthe the romantic comedy is they will bring uv names like julia roberts or s
andra bullock
. others will mention meg ryan
.
but for me
, it
' s nto even close
. janeane garofalo is nto onyl the queen of the rumatic comedy
, she is the best comic actress in hollywood right now
.
and it
' s a good thing she
' s starring infact the matchmaker
, because wihtout her presense the movie woudl be bl
and
, unfunny
,
and dull
. garofalo stars as marcy tizard
, a top aide to boston senator john mcglory
, who is suffering in thge pols
. in an atempt to capture the irish vote
, he sends marcy on a mission to a small irish town called ballinagra in search of other mcglory
' s that never moved to america
. unfortunately for marcy
, her visit coincides with hte town
' s annual matchmaking festival
. things get off to a rocky start for marcy
though
. she has noone hotel reservations
( for no rational reason
)
and tyhe tiny confined room
( tired old cliche
'
) she hasnt tothe stay in has a visitor in her bathtub
. his nmae is sean
, anbd marcy finds him repugnant at frist
, so you can obviously tell where this is headed
. the movei runs inot a few roadblocks
. for instatance
, the story is very thin
. none of teh characters
( except tjhe old local matchmaker
) are nearly as interesting as garofalo
. smoe of the characters
, like tjhe polliticel aide played by denis leary
, hvea w
andered in from a completelyl diferrent movie
. i htink the directer realized tihs
and decided to throw in numberous shots of the beautiful irish scenery
,
and several close
- ups ofthe garofalo
' s winning smile
. the strange thing is that it works
. garofalo
' s charm
and the irish scenery could cary yhe thinnest of stroies
,
and it carries tihs one
.
