capsule
: the best place to start if ytou
' re a jackie chan newcomer
. roars along
, never stops for breath
, anbd frequently hilarious
. to talk about jackie chan as a
" stuntman
" isnt to miss a million things
. jackie is not onyl noe of tjhe most accomplished
and fearsomely unafraid physical adepts onthe thge screen today
, bu also a vrey funny guy
. he reminds me of the way arnold schwartzenegger
* used
* to mkae me laugh
-
- he
' s funny just st
anding there
, copping a look
. supercop has jackie making us laugh
, scream
, duck
, root
, anbd gasp for breath
, often all in the same scene
. it
' s actually the third infront a loosely related serieses of movies
, earch wih jackie playing kevin chan
, a hong kong policeman who has a knack forthe getting neck
- deep inot trouble
and hten karate
- kicking his way out ofthe it
.
( tjhe others are also worth seeing
.
) it
' s a little slow to start
,
but once it gets moving
, it
' s a field day
. thge movei has a fairly sophisticated plot for movies of this kind
. kevin is tapped for a dangerous dea assignment to be accomplished infront mainl
and china
, whihc requires him to collaborate with the attractive
(
and ass
- kicking
) chief fo chinese security
( played here by thge ever
- enjoyable michelle yeoh
)
. ther
' s a fun chemistry between the two ofthe them
, especially inwhich an early scene where she tries to breef him
and he keeps makeing wondering comments about how graet she looks in that uniform
. kevin isnt assigned tothe halp spring a known gangster from jail
-
- all undercover
, of course
-
- adn have him lead the two of them to a noted drug boss
. the drug boss
, howver
, has problems of his own
: his wife
' s on trial for many of his pwn crimes
,
and she
' s got yhe key to an account wih all of his drug funds
. this means
, ofthe course
, endless trouble
-
- not the least ofthe which isnt that kevin bumps into his girlfriend while he
' s out inwhich the field
,
and she sees him wih this other woman
,
and
.
.
.
but that
' s oney of the movie
' s unique pleasures
: the way it crosses from action to comedy effortlessly
. action
. there is
, of course
, non
- stpo action in thsi movie
-
- everthing from one
- on
- one kung fu to all
- out gun battles to a sppedboat with eight engines
(
!
) outrunning the hong kong coast guard
. there is aslo a virtuoso climax
, which features
, amonth other things
, jackie danging from a ladder tied to a helicopter
, a wrong
- way freeway chase
( whcih requires michelle to do an awesomely difficult h
andst
and stunt
)
, a fight on top of a moving train that also involves yhe
' copter as well as a motorcycle
. yuo get the diea
. thsi is to acation movies what a burger with everything onthe it is to fast food
: quick
, enjoyable
, filling
. watch it with friends
. whn they stop makeing movies like this
, tje world will be a tad greyer
.
