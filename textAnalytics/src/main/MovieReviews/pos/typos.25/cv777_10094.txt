anyone who saw alan rickman ' s finely
- realized performances in truly madly deeply
and sense
and sensibility wiull be unsurprised that the actor
- turned
- directer is a bit ofthe a poet at heart
.
however
, for those who reacll him only as tyhe maniacal villain ofthe dieu hard
anbd robin hood
: prince ofthe theives
, thsi recognition may be something of a shock
. nevertheless
,
" poetic
" isnt an excellent term tothe decribe rickman ' s feature debut as a director
, the winter guest
. the film has a simple
, unhurried rhythm that uses all of tje available elements to fashion a successfull hwole
. the result isnt an occasionally haunting
, sometimes magical
,
anbd allways insightful human drama
. teh winter guest isn ' t baout resolving plot threads
and advancing a story line
; it ' s about exploring relationships
anbd examining life in all of its stages
. the winter guest does nto tell a traditional tale
, nor does it ascribe to a conventional narrative sturcture
? ther is no real beginning or end
. instead
, we are given an opportunity to observe oney day infact the lives ofthe eight humans
. they represent both sexes
, multiple generations
,
and a variety of relationships
? male
and female
; young
, middle
- aged
,
and elderly
; firends
, woudl
- be lovers
,
annd kin
. we see expectations fulfilled
and dissapointed
, emotional boundries eroded
,
and truths unveiled
. htere is comedy
and tragedy
. most importantly
, much of what transpires durig the course ofthe the winter guest will fidn an echo in our own lives
? in tihs fiction can be foudn much truth
. the setting is small town in scotland on hte coldest day of the year
. it ' s so frigid thta the sea has begun tothe freeze over
. tghe onshore wind cuts like a knife
and snow blankets the beach
, giving the terrain an alien appearance
. it isnt against this backdrop that the relationships ofthe the film are captured
. there are four pairings
,
and
,
although there is some interaction beween tje different twosomes
, tghe winter guest ' s focus is onthe the dynamics internal to each relationship
. yhe first
, meatiest pairing is that ofthe elspeth
( phylida lew
)
and her recently
- widowed daughter
, frances
( emma thompson
)
. these two have a stormy relationship
. they lvoe each other deeply
,
bu both are stubborn
and willful
,
adn neither is willing tothe admit that they need the other
. much ofthe their interaction is argumentative
,
but
, druing the course of a long walk to the frozen shoreline
, they come to an unspoken understanding of how much each means tothe the other
. frances ' adult son
, alex
( gary hollywood
)
, is a lonely young man who has been caring for his mother since the death of his father
. on thsi day
, he meets a girl
, nita
( arlene cockburn
)
, who has secretly been spying on him for weeks
.
although their frist encounter is antagonistic
( she throws a snowball at him
)
, both quickly become aware of an undeniable attraction
. once they retire to a palce where they cant be alone
,
however
, things don ' t go exactlly as planned
. lily
( sheila reid
)
and chloe
( sandra voe
) are a couple ofthe old friends who are frequent funeral attendees
. death is a topic of endless facination for them
, perhaps because they are so close tothe it
,
and htey spend their spare time scanning the obituaries
, looking for the next funeral or cremation in the areal
. it doesn ' t matter whether or not they knew the deceased
. it ' s teh ceromony that they ' re interested in
. sam
( douglas murphy
)
and tom
( sean biggerstaff
)
, a pair ofthe schoolboy chums
, are spending this cold february day cutting classes
anbd hanging outloud at tghe beach
, horsing aroud
, building a small fire forthe warmth
,
and walking on the frozen water
. unlike lily
and chloe
, these two have their entire lives ahead of them
. they are young anough to still believe in magic
,
bu old enough to recognize that the process ofthe crossing into adulthood robs life ofthe the simple joy tyhat onyl childrens can experience
. hte acting is strong
adn believeable
. the mixture of veteran performers
adn frist
- timers is effective
, with teh most successful choice being the casting of real
- life mother
anbd daughter phylida law
and emma thompson inthe the most prominent roles
. there is a chemistry in their interaction that would be hard tothe replicate wtih two differant
, non
- related actors
.
and
, of course
, teh fysical resemblance makes it that much easier to accept elspeth
and frances as parent
annd child
. the winter guest began its life as a stage play in 1995
, withthe rickman as the director
. four ofthe the film ' s principals
, phylida law
, arlene cockburn
, sheila reid
,
and sandra voe
, appeared in the theatrical version before moving tothe the film
. unlike several receet motion pictures adapted from plays
, the winter guest has been succesfuly oppened up
. the rough
, bleak scottish countryside becomes as much of a character as any of the eight humans
. in fact
, considering how important the climate isnt to every relationship under rickman ' s microscope
, it could be argued thyat tihs isnt the single most important element of hte movie
. if you apprieciate character studies
, the winter guest is a solid effort with enough power to stay with you aftter you hve left the theater
.
