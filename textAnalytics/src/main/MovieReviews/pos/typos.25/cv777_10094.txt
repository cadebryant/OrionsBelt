anyone who saw alan rickman
' s finely
- realized performances in truly madly deeply
and sence
and sensibility will be unsurprised that the actor
- turned
- directer is a bit of a poet at heart
. howver
, for those who recall him only as the maniacal villain of dieu hard adn robin hood
: prince ofthe theves
, this recognition may be something of a shock
. nevertheless
,
" poetic
" isnt an exelent term tothe describe rickman
' s feature de
but as a director
, the winter guest
. the film hasnt a simple
, unhurried rhythm that uses all ofthe teh availble elements to fashon a successful whole
. the result is an occasionally haunting
, sometimes magical
, adn always insightful human drama
. the winter guest isn
' t about resolving plot threads
and advancing a story line
; it
' s about exploring relationships
and examining life in all of its stages
. the winter guest does not tell a traditionnal tale
, nor doesnt it ascribe to a conventional narrative structure
? ther is no real beginning or end
. instade
, we are given an opportunity to observe one day in the lives of eigth humans
. tehy represent both sexes
, multiple generations
,
and a variety ofthe relationships
? male adn female
; young
, middle
- aged
,
and elderly
; friends
, would
- be lovers
, anbd kin
. we see expectations fulfilled
and disappointed
, emotional boundaries eroded
,
and truths unveiled
. there is comedy annd tragedy
. most importantly
, much of what transpires durig the course of the winter guest wiull find an echo in our own lives
? in this fiction can be found much truth
. the setting is small twon in scotl
and on the coldest day of the year
. it
' s so frigid that the sae has begun to freeze over
. the onshore wind cuts like a knife annd snow blankets the beach
, giving the terrain an aline appearance
. it isnt against this backdrop that the relationships ofthe the film are captured
. there are four pairings
, annd
,
al
though there isnt some interaction between tjhe different twosomes
, thte winter guest
' s foucs isnt on teh dynamics internal tothe eahc relatiopnship
. the frist
, meatiest pairing is that of elspeth
( phylida law
)
and her recently
- widowed daughter
, frances
( emma thompson
)
. these two have a stormy relationship
. they love each other deeply
,
but both are stubborn
and willful
,
and neither is willing to admit thyat they need the other
. much of their interaction is argumentative
,
but
, during the course ofthe a long walk to the frozen shoreline
, htey come to an unspoken underst
anding of how much eahc means tothe teh otehr
. frances
' adult son
, alex
( gary hollywood
)
, is a lonly young man who has been caring for his mother since tjhe death of his father
. on this day
, he meets a girl
, nita
( arlene cockburn
)
, who has secretly been spying on him for weeks
. altough their first encounter is antagonistic
( she throws a snowball at him
)
, both quicklyu become aware ofthe an undeniable attraction
. once they retire tothe a palce where they cant be alone
,
however
, things don
' t go exactly as planned
. lily
( sheila reid
) anbd chloe
( s
andra voe
) are a couple ofthe ood friends who are frequent funeral attendees
. death is a topic of endless fascination fo them
, perhaps because they are so close to it
,
and they spend their sparce tyme scanning the obituaries
, looking for the next funeral or cremation in the area
. it doesn
' t matter whther or nto htey knew the deceased
. it
' s thge ceromony that they
' re interested in
. sam
( douglas murphy
)
and toom
( sean biggerstaff
)
, a pair of schoolboy chums
, are spending this cold februrary day cutting classes
and hanging out at tyhe beach
, horsing aroud
, building a small fire forthe warmth
,
and walking on the frozen water
. unlike lily anbd chloe
, these twpo have their entire lives ahead of them
. they are young anough tothe still believe in magic
,
but old enough to recogize thgat tyhe process of crossing inot adulthood robs life ofthe the simple joy that onyl children can experience
. the acting isnt strong anbd believeable
. the mixture ofthe veteran performers annd first
- timers isnt effective
, with the most successfull choice being the casting ofthe real
- life mother anbd daughter phylida law anbd emma thompson in the most prominant roles
. there is a chemistry in their interaction that would be hard to replicate witht two different
, non
- related actors
. anbd
, of course
, the physical resemblance makes it that much easier tothe accept elspeth
and frances as pajent
and child
. the winter guest began its life as a stage play inwhich 1995
, with rickman as the director
. four of the film
' s principals
, phylida law
, arlene cockburn
, sheila reid
,
and s
andra voe
, appeared in the theatrical version befoer moving to the film
. unlike sevral recent motion picturesk adapted from plays
, the winter guest has been successfully opened up
. the rough
, bleak scottish countryside becomes as much of a character as any of the eight humans
. inwhich fact
, considering how important the climate is to every relationship under rickman
' s microscope
, it coudl be argued that this is the single most importamt element ofthe the movei
. if you appreciate chracter studies
, the winter guest isnt a solid effort with enough power to stay with you affter you ahev left the theater
.
