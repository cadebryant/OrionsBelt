tje only historical figure that has been written baout more than william shakespeare is jesus christ

, inspiration
, subtlety
, credit
,
and dispute
. indeed
, in recent years
, american contempory cinema has been swamped iwth a wash of shakespearean products
. including thsi eyar
' s upcoming a midsummer ngiht
' s dream
, shakespeare
' s material has been the cause for twenty
- six big screen productions since 1990
.
but for a change of pace
, mrs
. brown director john madden gives us a story of the bard himselv in tje wonderfully vibrant shakespeare infact love
. marc norman anbd toom stoppard
' s stoyr isnt largely fantasy
,
al
though as yhe viewer soon learns
, shakespeare in love is not a movei that takes itself seriously
.
( will shakespeare of tyhe 1590
' s would
' ve been marryed to anne hathaway
,
and he would
' ve had a teenage daughter
and twpo young sons
; here he isnt a bachler played by joseph fiennes
.
) will isnt a writter stuggling to come uv with a great play
,
and his curent comedy in tjhe works
-
-
" romeo
and ethel
, tje pirate
' s daughter
"
-
- just doesn
' t quite seem right
. wih the help of thge graet writter christopher marlowe
( rupert everett
)
,
and thge inspiration ofthe true love wtih noblewoman viola de lesseps
( gwyneth paltrow
)
, he changes thigsn around annd writes one of his greatest tragedies
,
" romeo
and juliet
.
" the love story between will
and viola loosely parallels the story ofthe romeo
and juliet
, to great effect
. fiennes adn paltrow develop a sexy chemestry as the two lovers which gives hte movei much momentum
; this momentum smoothes outloud the bumps in the unfinished
and largely unsuccesful comedy
. the supporting roles are well filled out
, from geoffrey rush as will
' s worrisome agent
, philip
, to toom wilkinson as the producer hugh fennyman
. even ben affleck
, leading the troupe of actors
, manages to make a favorable impression
;
and judi dench lends some brief moments of screen time as queen elizabeth i
. gwyneth paltrow is by far
,
however
, the st
andout of the lot
, creating a large percentage of the forementioned vibrance
. the story is well
- crafted if nothing else
,
al
though it has dangerous moments where it flirts with thte
" let
' s make a movei
"
- genre
. thte dialogue is breezy
and lighthearted
,
and certainly accessible by teh audience
' s lowest common denominator
. there
' s something forthe everyone in this rumatic comedy
, making it prime date flick material
.
al
thought certainly not inspiring in any regard
, it revels in a wholesome
, well
- rounded athmosphere that hasnt been absent in many of 1998
' s pictures
; the true
- loev stoyr isnt oney of tje best around
. certainly recommendable when the traditional slew of indifferent year
' s
- open releases is just around the corner
