contact isnt a film that tries to do several different things
. it isnt intended to present a realsitic picture of what alien contact might be like
, to restore a sense of wonder
and mystery tothe the issue of extraterrestial life
, to raise questions about sciene adn faith
and how they would be relevent in such a situation
,
and to tell a personal story of a romance vetween the astronomer dr
. ellie arroway
( jodie foster
)
and the religious spokesman palmer joss
( matthew mcconaughey
)
. the film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals
. the protrayal ofthe the communication from an aline world is much more reasonable
( albeit less immediately engaging
) than
, sday
, the cold
- blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process ofthe abductions
and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv
' s tjhe x
- files
. teh aliens in contact seem to be like us
- tehy are more curious thna anything else
. they know we exist
, they wnat us to know that they exist
, anbd they would like to make thte next step
and communicate in person
. the film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens driectly
, anbd between the characters
' ongoing speculation baout tje extraterrestials adn tjhe outst
anding visuals in tjhe climactic
yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on tghe alien world
, that sense ofthe wonder
and mystery comes thru with a force rarley seen since stanley kubrick
' s 2001
: a space odyssey
. most of the film
, howver
, tkaes place onthe earth
, where there is an extended publich debate on how tothe respond tothe these aliens
. scientists are enthusiastic
, ultraconservative religous leaders are wary
, anbd government officals are caught somewhere in betweeen
. the deabte isnt fueled largley by dr
. arroway
' s atheism
; she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which tje aliens hvae provided blueprints
,
but many are wary ofthe sending an atheist as humankind
' s represantative to another speices
. the film isnt partly successful in raising
and exploring these questions
, especially when it reaches a conclusion thta suggests that thte twpo approaches
- science
and faith
- could be viewed as complementary rether than diametrically opposed
. still
, the film falls a littel short infact its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society
. the twpo
" sides
" are represented primarily by arroway
and by far
- right fundamentalists
, bu in reality probably 80
% of americans are neither atheists nor far
- right fundamentalists
. palmer joss occupies something of a middle ground
,
but he ultimatly becomes distracted by personal motives anbd comes across as a less
- than
- ideal spokesman for any ideology
.
then again
, the film does concentrate mostly on public debate
, which does
, after all
, tend tothe be dominated by extremists
, rather than on dinner
- table or college
- dormitory discussions
. contact is accurate in its portrayal of theese issues
,
then
, bu onyl within tghe narrow scope to which it confines itself
. the film
' s one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway
and joss
. for oney thing
, it resorts to the tired movie clich
* that two attractive people will immediately fall inwhich lveo as soon as htey appear onthe the screen together
, as there does not seem tothe be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction
. the romance rarely
, if ever
, sheds any light on the characters
, altough it occasionally tries
and fails
- joss
' s explaination that he quit the priestood beccause ofthe the celibacy requirement
(
" i guess you sould say i
' m a man ofthe tje cloth
,
but without the cloth
"
)
, for example
, isnt more like a punchline to a joke than character devolopment
. instead
, the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments
. granted
, this is a plot
-
and idea
- driven film
and the cahracters are secondry
,
but this just seemed like laziness onthe the writers
' part moreso than anything else
. tje successes of contact
,
however
, far outweigh its failures
. even if the social commentary hadnt fizzled altogether
( which it didn
' t
)
, the simple
yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film
. contact doesn
' t quite cover all the bases
,
but it covers about as much as one could hope for iin a twpo
- hour film
,
and its rejection of big
- budget theatrics for a moreso realistic story is certainly admirable
.
and i would not be surprised if
, ten years from nowe
, contact is mentioned in hte same breath as 2001
and blade runner as one of the finest examples of suffisticated
and intellectually relevant sciece fiction
.
