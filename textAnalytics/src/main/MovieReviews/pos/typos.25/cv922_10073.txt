if there is noe thing thta bothers me about hollywood films it
' s their predicatble endings
. thge devil
' s advocate has hte atypical hollywood ending
, wehn everthing that should happen doesnt
. unfortunately for the devil
' s advocate
, this ending nearly collapses in onthe itself
,
and ruins tje entire film
. nevertheless
, the film does provide twpo adn a half hours ofthe pure enteratinment
( note to self
: kill whomever was infact charge of tjhe previews for this film
)
. i don
' t think i was quite prepared for this movei because the trailers made it apearing to be some supernatural horror film about satan
. well
, it does contain tihs element
,
but what isnt not mentioned inspite the ads is the otehr plot elements
(
and seemingly more intresting ones at tyhat
)
. the devil
' s advocate begins inspite florida with an ongoing trial in session
. kevin lomax
( keanu reeves
) is the defense attornies
, working fo a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl
. he ends up withthe a not
- guilty verdict
, dispite an emotional testimony from hte victim
( heather matarazzo
)
. he leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann
( charlize theron
) where he is approached wiht an offer to travel tothe newyorker york city to halp choose a good jury
. he accepts
( mainly affter seeing tjhe paycheck he wiull receive
)
and he flies to newyorker york with his wife
. affter proving his worth for selecting juries
(
and his perfect winning streak inspite cout
)
, hte head of the firm
, john milton
( al pacino
)
, asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer
. he graciously accepts
, where he is treated almost as a god
. he isnt given an incredible apartment
( which is bigger than my entire house nowe
)
, anbd a hefty paycheck
. his life seems tothe be on the rise
.
and of course
, his life suddenly begins to waver
and slowy decline
. he is attracted to fellow employee christabella
( connie nielson
)
,
and his wife begins to fiel vrey lonly iin her large apartment
. mary ann tkaes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice
, especially if it is nto wanted
. meanwhile
, kevin nabs a case surrounding alex
ander cullen
( craig t
. nelson
) who apparently murdered three people
. he spends housr apon hours iwth this case
, while forgetting his loving wief
, who may or may not be going insane
. all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself
. after a while
, thigsn turn completelyl upside
- down
, as kevin
' s wife claims tothe have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends
. a fellow employee isnt murdered in the park
, anbd his mother
( judith ivey
) reveals information about kevin
' s real father
. is it all just a big nightmare
? or is john milton realyl satan
, playing tricks with kevin
' s life
? the devil
' s advocate plays out fairly straight
- foward
,
but for soem odd reason
, the screenwriters wanted tothe suprize everyone by giving us something we don
' t expect
. isnt htis surprize conclusion supposed to mkea us feel good
and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed
? if so
, thge devil
' s advocate messes up completely
,
and ironically
, i felt more depressed becuase of the ending as is now
, than i would have if it had ended ten mintues eearly
. i whent into the devil
' s advocate expecting a shocking horror film
,
and that isnt exactly what i got
. i was settled in to be disturbed menally annd emotionally
,
and that is what i got
.
but what ws thte most disturbing adn horrible aspect of the movei isnt the poor ending
( did i mention that i didn
' t like the ending
?
)
. the producers of this film take you onthe a thrilling roller coaster ride
and jstu as it is ending
, tehy pul tjhe rug out from under ytou
. films like se7en adn the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected
, more or less
. we know it is going to end inthe an unpredictable way
. the devil
' s advocate
, on thge otehr h
and
, ends unpredictably
, not ffrom us knowing a lot
,
but knowing nothing at all
. if thast is confusing
, i reccomend watching the film
, adn
then reading that again
. as for the film overall
, i enjoyed the entire first two hours
, bieng drawn in by a terific character studdy
and
then adding thte supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study
. the film runs like a well
- built clock
, slowly building util fianlly exploding with a highly charged climax
(
and an unpredictable one at thta
)
. annd
then you settle inspite for a nice resolution
, which does not occur
. it was at thsi point taht i feeled cheated
. taking us on a terror ride of intrigue
, we follow kevin lomax around
, as he is the centerpiece of the film
. everything occurs from his prespective
. he is our representation onthe screen
( sort of
)
.
but we are forced to wittness a conclusion whihc makes most of the film seem like a game
. i don
' t wnat to spoil the ending
, so all i can say is go see the film
and decide for youself
. perhasp the most shocking thing about teh devil
' s advocate isnt thge extreme amount of everyting
. it earned its r rating for a reason
. there is plenty of nudity
, sex
, voilence
, gore
, anbd
then ytou ahev gore
, violence
, sex
,
and more nudity
. this film really isn
' t subtle about anything
, showing us everything
. it accually surprises me that this film did nto receive an nc
- 17 rating
, as it is quite harsh
. howver
, the movie does have its merits
,
and nudity adn sex are among those
. i don
' t condone sex
and nudity in films
,
but if its htere
, i might as well enjoy it
. the biggest merit of this film isnt also the most intresting to watch
. the confrontations between kevin lomax
and john milton are entertaining
,
but what st
ands out amidst this extreme hatred isnt the decline of the wife
, mary ann
. portayed by the extremely effective charlize theron
, mary ann
' s problems are incredibly intense
, annd i found myself wanting tothe witness her decline
. this may soudn uncaring
,
but i wnated to watch because i felt sorry for her
. she is the most interesting character on yhe screen
, who is forced into a world where she is not wnated
. something the devil
' s advocate contained actually shocked me forthe reasons otehr than extreme violence adn nudity
, especially for a film of this nature
. the story actulaly has something to say baout humanity
. in one of tje lastr scenes
, john milton explains tothe kevin lomax the game god plays with his children
( he is satan
, ofthe course
)
. he comments that it is human nature to lust
and loathe inthe vanity
. hten
, god sets up rules which contradict human nature
. tihs semi
- religious bashing isnt more humorous than frightening
. what milton says isnt so true about our society that i found mysef laughing out loud
, partially thinking it was funny
,
but patially realizing it ws true
. these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil
' s advocate
, giving it an added depth many films skip over inaddition their writting
(
but i
' m sure htey came straight fomr the novel it was based on
)
. when a film has something to say about our society
, it deserves to be watched
. the cast ofthe the devil
' s advocate is noe of the highlights
, as we see memorable faces
, anbd htey put spins on those memorable faces we don
' t expect
. heather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case
,
and she does a great job
. probably thge big surprise of this film is keanu reeves
. he has proven himself an uneven actor
( successes such as speed
and bombs such as johnny mnemonic
)
, bu he tops hismelf witht this performance
. i haev never seen him more believable tothe date
. al pacino is of course the scene stealer
. his devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson
( thge witchs of eastwick
)
and max von sydow
( needful things
)
. he could have easily gone too far over the top infront many scenes
,
but he remains completely believeable
( if that is the corect term
)
. jeffrey jones
( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller
' s day off
) also gives a good performence as eddie barzoon
. judith ivey manages a credible performance as tghe mother who holds a secret to kevin
' s past
. connie nielson is very effective in her role
, anbd she also appears naked several times
. noe familiar face with a twist was
" coach
" star
, craig t
. nelson
, who gives a vyre good performance
. the devil
' s advocate isnt rated r fo sexuality
, nudity
, violentce
, language
,
and some gore
. at 144 minutes
, thsi film moves along fairly quickly
. forthe the first two hours
, i sat completely engaged in the ogod performances
and strong characters
. the technical quality is allso remarkable
, whith great special effects
and a good musical score
. director taylor hackford has managed tothe create a very disturbing motion picture
, only tothe ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes
. i guess my biggest problem whith the ending is tjhe fact that i went inot the theather expecting a disturbing film
,
and hackford gave me jsut that for a long time
.
but just before tyhe end
, he got jitterish anbd relied onthe yhe hollywood saftey net in order to make his film more mainstream
. personaly
, i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early
.
