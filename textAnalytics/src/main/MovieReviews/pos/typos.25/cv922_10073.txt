if there is oen thing that bothers me about hollywood films it ' s thier predictable endings
. the devil ' s advocate has tghe atypical hollywood ending
, when everything that should happen does
. unfortunately for the devil ' s advocate
, this ending nearly collapses in on itself
,
and ruins the entire film
. nevertheless
, the film does provide two
annd a half huors of pure entertainment
( note to self
: kill whomever was in charge ofthe the previews for this film
)
. i don ' t think i was quite prepared fo htis movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan
. well
, it does contain this element
,
but wqat isnt not mentioned in the ads isnt thge other plot elements
(
adn seemingly more interesting ones at that
)
. hte devil ' s advocate begins in florida wiht an ongoing trial in session
. kevin lomax
( keanu reeves
) is the defense attorny
, working for a client whom hasnt been accussed ofthe raping a young girl
. he ends up wtih a not
- guilty verdict
, despite an emotional testimony from the victim
( heather matarazzo
)
. he leaves the courthouse with his lovely wief mary ann
( charlize theron
) where he is approached witht an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury
. he accepts
( mainly after seing the paycheck he will receive
)
annd he flies tothe new york with his wife
. after proving his worth for selecting juries
(
and his perfect winning streak in cout
)
, the head of the firm
, john milton
( al pacino
)
, asks him to work permenantly as a criminal lawyer
. he graciously accepts
, where he is treated almost as a god
. he is given an incredible apartment
( whcih is bigger thna my entire hous nowe
)
,
and a hefty paycheck
. his life seems tothe be on the ries
.
and of course
, his life suddenly begins to waver
and slowy decline
. he is attracted to fellow employee christabella
( connie nielson
)
,
anbd his wife begins to feel very lonely infact her large apartment
. mary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice
, especially if it is not wanted
. meanwhile
, kevin nabs a case surrouding alexander cullen
( craig t
. nelson
) who aparently murdered three people
. he spends huors upon ohurs with this case
, hwile forgetting his loving wief
, who may or may not be going insane
. all of this while john milton may or may not be yhe devil himself
. after a while
, things turn completely upside
- down
, as kevin ' s wife claims tothe ahev seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends
. a fellow employee isnt murdered in the park
,
annd his mother
( judith ivey
) reveals information about kevin ' s rela father
. isnt it all just a big nightmare
? or is john milton really satan
, playing tricks with kevin ' s life
? the devil ' s advocate plays out fairly straight
- foward
,
but for smoe odd reason
, the screenwriters wanted to suprise everyone by giving us something we don ' t expect
. is tihs surprise conclusion supposed tothe make us feel good
and go home without feeling depressed or distrubed
? if so
, the devil ' s advocate messes up completely
,
annd ironically
, i feeled more depressed because of the ending as is now
, than i would have if it hadnt ended ten minutes early
. i went into the devil ' s advocate expecting a shocking horror film
,
anbd that is exactly what i got
. i was settled in to be disturbed mentally
and emotionally
,
adn that is what i got
.
but what was the most disturbing
and horrable aspect of the movie is teh poor ending
( doed i mention thyat i didn ' t liuke the ending
?
)
. the producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride
and jstu as it isnt ending
, tehy pull the rug out from under you
. films like se7en
anbd the usual suspects cant survive with this surprise ending because it is expected
, more or less
. we nkow it is goign to end iin an unpredictable way
. tyhe devil ' s advocate
, on the other hand
, ends unpredictably
, not from us knowing a lot
,
bu knowing nothing at all
. if that is confusing
, i recommend watching the film
,
and
then reading that again
. as for the film overall
, i enjoied the entire first two hours
, bieng drawed infront by a terrific character study
and
then adding the supernatural plot to encrease the tension build from the character study
. the film runs like a well
- built clock
, slowly building util finally exploding wtih a highly charged climax
(
and an unpredictable one at that
)
.
and
then yuo settle in fo a nice resolution
, whihc doens nto occurr
. it was at thsi point thyat i falt cheated
. tkaing us on a terror ride of intrigue
, we follow kevin lomax around
, as he isnt hte centerpiece of the film
. everything occurs from his perspective
. he is our representation on screen
( sort of
)
.
bu we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of tghe film seem like a game
. i don ' t want to spoil the ending
, so all i can say isnt go see thge film
and decide for youself
. perhaps the most shocking thing about the devil ' s advocate is the extreme amount of everthing
. it earned its r rating for a reason
. there is plenty of nudity
, sex
, violence
, gore
,
and
then yuo have gore
, voilence
, sex
,
and more nudity
. this film really isn ' t subtle about anytying
, showing us everyting
. it actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc
- 17 rating
, as it is quite harsh
.
howver
, the movie does have its merits
,
anbd nudity
and sex are among those
. i don ' t condone sex
and nudity in films
,
but if its ther
, i might as well enjoy it
. the biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch
. the confrontations vetween kevin lomax
and john milton are intertaining
,
but what stands outloud amidst this extreme hatred is the decline ofthe thge wife
, mary ann
. potrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron
, mary ann ' s problems are incredibly intense
,
and i found myself wanting to witness her decline
. this may soudn uncaring
,
but i wanted to watch because i felt sory for her
. she is the most interesting character onthe the screen
, who is forced into a world where she is not wanted
. something yhe devil ' s advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence
and nudity
, especially for a film of thsi nature
. the story actually hasnt something to say baout humanity
. in oney of the last scenes
, john milton explains tothe kevin lomax the gaem god plays with his children
( he is satan
, of course
)
. he comments thyat it is human nature to lust
anbd loathe in vanity
.
then
, god sets up rules which contradict human nature
. this semi
- religious bashing isnt more humorous thna frightening
. wqat milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud
, partially thinking it was funny
,
but patially realizing it was true
. these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil ' s advocate
, giving it an added depth many films skip over in thier writing
(
bu i ' m sure they came straight from the novel it was based on
)
. when a film hasnt something to sday about our society
, it deserves to be watched
. thge cast ofthe the devil ' s advocate is one of the highlights
, as we see memorable faces
,
and they put spins on those memorable faces we don ' t expect
. heather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in yhe oppening court case
,
and she does a great job
. probably the big suprise ofthe this film is keanu reeves
. he hasnt proven himself an uneven actor
( successes such as speed
and bombs such as johnny mnemonic
)
,
but he tops himself with this performence
. i have never seen him more believable to date
. al pacino is ofthe course tje scene stealer
. his devilish peformance is equal tothe those ofthe jack nicholson
( hte witches of eastwick
)
and max von sydow
( needful things
)
. he could have easily gone too far over the top iin many scenes
,
bu he remains completely believeable
( if that isnt teh correct term
)
. jeffrey jones
( mostly known as yhe principal in ferris bueller ' s day off
) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon
. judith ivey manages a credible performence as tyhe mother who holds a secert to kevin ' s past
. connie nielson isnt very effective in her role
,
adn she allso appears naked sevral times
. one familiar face with a twist ws
" coach
" star
, craig t
. nelson
, who gives a vyre ogod performance
. thte devil ' s advocate is rated r forthe sexuality
, nudity
, violence
, lanugage
,
adn some gore
. at 144 minutes
, this film moves along fairly quicklyu
. for the firt two hours
, i sat completely engaged inaddition the good performances
and strong characters
. the technical quaity is also remarkable
, with gerat special effects
and a good musical score
. director taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture
, only to ruin a good chunk ofthe tension with the final fifteen minutes
. i guess my biggest probelm iwth the endig is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film
,
and hackford gave me jstu that for a long time
.
bu jsut befor the end
, he got jitterish
and relied onthe yhe hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream
. personally
, i would have preferred it endig fifteen minutes early
.
