no
, it isnt not a bad film
, infront fact it is so good iin achieving its purpose
, i actually wished forthe the film to end itself quickly
. event horizon is not your run
- of
- the
- mill sci
- fi film
, i
' m sure many who have watched this will agree with me
. it is nto even original in that sense
,
and it does borrow heavily ffrom films like alien
, hellraiser annd even blade runner
. the magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting
and methodical build
- up that makes it wonderfully horrifying
. the story brings us to the year 2050
, where spoace travel have since enormously progressed
. the event horizon isnt actually a ship built fo a secre experimental purpose
; it has the ability to fold time
and space thus makeing it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a man
' s lifetime
. the ship disapeared as soon as it went into operation bu after 7 years
, it reappeared again within thge orbit ofthe neptune
. a search adn rescue team led by miller
( fishburne
) is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon
. the designer of the ship
, dr
. weir
( neill
) follows along to satisfy his curiosity onthe waht actualy hapened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship
. event horizon isnt a sci
- fi horror film
, much truer tothe the owrd than say
, alien would ever be
. while in aline
, the crew has to cope with a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces
, in event horizon
, the forces whitch goes against the crew is undefined
but
yet so powerful
and horrifying
. tje story unfolds itself slowly
and the suspense buildup is superb
, up till thte point where i really felt liuke saying out loud
` enought
! i cxan
' t st
and this anymore
!
'
. there are omre than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime
. the story in itself is nto exactly something very exciting adn also
, the acting is only at most
, average by most commercial st
andards
. even so
, tjhe essense of horror is carried outloud very well in this film
, thanks tothe its well
- paced storytelling
, disturbing set designs
and smoe really gory sequences
( whihc incidentially
, has been quite generously removed by our censorship board
)
. director paul
anderson
( who did mortal kombat
) anbd his team of
` atmosphere
' creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term
` horror
'
. this picture did not dont very well in the us box
- office most probably for the dread
- factor inpact it has on most audiences
; people wiull nto see it again
and not many woudl recommend their friend tothe watch this
.
al
though on the face of it
, event horizon is mostly molded for mass
- entertainment
; many thrills
, spills anbd suspense tothe keep audiences infront focuse
.
however
, the offbeat horror element which it ultimatly convey audiences is very disturbing
. my friend
and i could not sday a owrd tothe each other for qutie a while after gonig through the
` experince
' of event horizon
. i guess it was just the emmense feeling ofthe dread whcih the film had cast apon us
. be forewarned
, this film is not for the faint
- hearted nor for pure entertainment
. be prepared tothe be disturbed if you should decide to watch thsi film
! event horizon is highly recommended
?
?
but at your own risk
! it has been a long time since good
- horror embraced the big screen
,
and event horizon is one
.
