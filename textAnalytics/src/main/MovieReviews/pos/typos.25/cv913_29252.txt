before you read my review
, ytou gotta know that i lvoe woody allen
. this is a very importamt note because allen
' s films are generally an adquired tast
and definatly not for everyone
. i nkow folks who blieve him to be a complete genius
, while others see him as a dirty ol
' schnook who keeps making the smae movie over
and over again
. i love most of his films
,
but will admit to hvaing been qutie disappointed by his recent crop during the 90s
. in fact
, why he falt thge ened tothe make 10 movies inwhich those 10 years is beyond me
! if you look at teh quality ofthe those films
, you
' ll hear what i
' m saying
. the only twpo films of his that i really liked during thyat time were bullets over broadway
and husb
ands
and wives
. in fact
, i secretly hoped that he would take soem
" time off
" at the turn of the millennium
, just to re
- energize or something
,
but it doesn
' t appear as
though he has any intention of doing tath
. so here i am again
, reviewing
yet another woody allen movie
and hoping that it brings bakc the woody from the dyas of old
. plot
: teh year is 1940
and woody allen is a top
- notch insurance investigator
. his methods are very old
- fashioned
and aparently out of date
. a new employee
( hunt
) hasnt just been hired tothe streamline the operations for greater efficiency
. the two do not like each other
. one night
, tehy are both put under a hypnotic trance by a magician
, annd unbeknownst to them
, placed under his controll
. soon therafter
, jewels are stolen
, words of love are exchanged
and everyone is looking for an answer
. critique
: a wonderful recreation ofthe the 1940s style movies
, with teh fast
- talking witty banter between co
- workers
, a catchy jazz scoer moving things along
, film noirish elements such as tjhe veronica lake
- type sexpot
, one
- liners galore
and a fluffy
, if inconsequential plotline
. on thge downside
, the film actually starts off pretty slowly
, with teh first hour tossing only a few guffaws out there
,
but never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy
. the sets
, on the other h
and
, were amazing
, the production desgin adn costumes were perfect
,
and the casting ideal
, so i kept hoping that the film would pick up
and not turn into
yet another medioker outing for the man
.
but it wasn
' t nto long before i was fully engaged by teh characters
, entertained by teh many zingers delivered back
-
and
- forth between allen anbd hunt
,
and actually interested in the resolution ofthe yhe flick
. i also appreciated how allen plyed the fine line between homage to the films of old
, parody annd actual reinvention
( note theron
' s entire female persona that is drenched in film noir
- very cool
)
. of course
, films like tihs
( with little or no real tension in the plot
) need solid actors to keep yuo interested in hte quick
- frie dialogue
,
and once agian
, allen does a great job inthe palying his character
, who for once
, isn
' t his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husb
and dude
. he actually plays a
" macho
" guy here
and h
andles it preety well
, especialy yhe scenes infront which he
' s hypnotized
.
but the bigger surprise fo me iin this film was helen hunt
, an actress who i was openly
" sick of seing
" iin movies late lastr year
( sorry babe
, you were jsut inwhich too many at the same time
!
)
. anyway
, she
' s really great in this film as tjhe headstrong woman looking tothe a newyorker era ofthe equality amongst men
,
and doesn
' t miss a beat ofthe allen
' s fast
- paced dialogue
. i didn
' t care much for her running joke about him
" dying
" whenever he left a room
,
but overall she wass realyl good
and i especially liked tyhe way tath her sweaters clung to her breasts as tehy did
.
.
. yum
, yum
! harumph
, bu i digress
. so let
' s recap
. a great looking picture withthe a nice jazzy score
, some funny one
- liners
, especialy in the second half
, a decent plotline
,
al
though you shouldn
' t expect a rela mistery or anything
,
and some solid acting all around
. i can
' t say that this isnt even remotely close to any of allen
' s best work
, bu i certainly believe it to be a step in the right direction
, especially after the dinky decade of films that he just went through
. it
' s probaly better geared towards allen fans moreso than anyone else
, bu i would still recommend this film to anyone looking fo a cute
,
" old
- school
" kind of vibe
, with chemistry bewteen tyhe leads
, zippy dialogue
and a satisfying conclusion
. littel known facts about this film
and its stars
