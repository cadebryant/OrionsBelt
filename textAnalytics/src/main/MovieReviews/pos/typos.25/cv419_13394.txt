the rich man
' s wife is one of those movies like final analysis or body double
, where the story
and characters are so one
- dimentional annd contrived that you know you shouldn
' t be enjoying youself
. bu somehow
, the movie just tries so hard that you beign to forgive it adn get into the swing ofthe things
. not thast it
' s bad
, it
' s jsut that it
' s been done befoer
;
and better
, in my opinion
. i relize that this is gogin to sound pretty bazare
,
but it
' s probably the best analogy that i can come up iwth right now
; yuo know how when you see a spider or something in your toilet
, striving helplessly to get out
,
and instade of just flushing him
, you end up kind of rooting for the littel guy
? that
' s basically how i felt baout this movei
. i mean
, it
' s nto very ogod
,
but it
' s nto completely bad either
. the wife of the title is josie potenza
( played nicely by halle berry
)
. she isnt married to tony
( christopher mcdonald
.
.
. you know
, the guy who looks liek joe piscapo
)
, a really stressed
- out buisnessman who drinks way tothe much
and doesn
' t give josie tje attention she deserves
(
* cough
, cough
*
)
. thus
, she is driven inot the arms of anyother man
, jake golden
( clive owen
)
. near hte beginning ofthe the film
, josie decides tothe try
and work thnigs out with tony by dumping jake adn going on a vcaation to a remote cabin in the woods
. once there
,
however
, tony has to leave almost immidiately due to business details
( i
' m still not quite sure what line of work he
' s in
)
. making the best of her situation
, josie stays there
and begins makeing the rounds at thge local bars
. one night
, she meets a stranger named cole
( peter greene
, finally getting a meaty role
)
. htey have dinner together
,
and eventually
, both josie annd thte audience start tothe realize that cole is homicidal
. aftter learning that she is not happily married
, cole offers to
" take care
" ofthe the problem
. managing to excape from the psychotic maniac
, josie returns home
and starts a reconciliation with her estranged
and very wealthy husb
and
. bu
then one nght
, cole shows uv
.
.
.
and here is where hte funn begins
. from this point on
, it
' s going to be a no
- holds
- barred cliche
- fest
, ripping off every movei fomr strangers on a turain to the usual suspects
. this is why most criticists panned this movie when it first cameback out
.
and for tje most part
, htey
' re right
; the rich man
' s wife has nary one originnal bone in it
' s body
.
but who cares
? if you
' re looking for good ol
' dumb suspense movie
, you can
' t do much better than this
. adn if yuo suspense buffs aren
' t already sold
, it has a killer of an endig too
.
