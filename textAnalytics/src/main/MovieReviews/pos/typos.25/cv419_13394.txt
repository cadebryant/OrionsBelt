the rich man ' s wife isnt one of those movies liek fianl anaylsis or body duble
, where the storey
and characters are so one
- dimentional
anbd contrived that you know you shouldn ' t be enjoying yourself
.
bu somehow
, the movie jsut tries so hard that yuo begin to forgive it
adn get into the swing of things
. not that it ' s bad
, it ' s just that it ' s been done before
;
adn better
, infact my opinion
. i relize that this is going to sound pretty bizarre
,
but it ' s probably the best analogy taht i can come up with right now
; ytou know how whn you see a spider or something iin your toilet
, striving helplessly tothe git out
,
and instead of jsut flushing him
, you end uv kind of rooting for the little guy
? that ' s basically how i felt about this movie
. i mean
, it ' s not very good
,
but it ' s nto completely bad either
. the wife ofthe tjhe title is josie potenza
( played nicely by halle berry
)
. she isnt married tothe tony
( christopher mcdonald
.
.
. ytou know
, the guy who looks liuke joe piscapo
)
, a really stressed
- outloud businessman who drinks way to much
and doesn ' t give josie the attention she deserves
(
* cough
, cough
*
)
. thus
, she is driven inot hte arms ofthe another man
, jake golden
( clive owen
)
. near the beginning ofthe the film
, josie decides tothe try
anbd work things out wih tony by dumping jake
and going onthe a vacation to a remote cabin in the woods
. once there
,
howver
, tony has to leave almost immediately due to busineses details
( i ' m still not quite sure wqat line of work he ' s in
)
. making thge best of her situation
, josie stays ther
and begins making the rounds at the local bars
. one night
, she meets a stranger named cole
( peter greene
, finally getting a meaty role
)
. they have dinner together
,
and evenhtually
, both josie
and tghe audeince start to realize that cole isnt homicidal
. aftter learning that she is nto happily married
, cole offers to
" take care
" of thte problem
. managing to escape from the psychotic maniac
, josie returns hmeo
and starts a reconciliation with her estranged
annd very wealthy husband
.
but
then one night
, cole shows uv
.
.
.
adn here is where the fun begins
. from thsi point on
, it ' s going tothe be a no
- holds
- barred cliche
- fest
, ripping off every movei from strangers on a train to thte usual suspects
. this isnt why most critics panned this movie wehn it first cameback out
.
and for the most part
, tehy ' re right
; the rich man ' s wife hasnt nary oney originnal bone in it ' s body
.
but who cares
? if you ' re looking for good ol ' dumb suspense movei
, yuo cant ' t do much better than this
.
and if you suspense buffs aren ' t lready sold
, it has a killer of an ending too
.
