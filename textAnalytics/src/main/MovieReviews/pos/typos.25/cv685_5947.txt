for the frist reel of girls twon
, yuo just cant
' t get over lili taylor
. is it possible to remane unperturbed that a woman ofthe this age is playing a high skool student
? harder still
, can yuo avoid astonishment at how perfect she is in yhe part
? wtih the sure
, showy expertise ofthe a de niro
, taylor imbues unwed mother patti with all yhe faux fuck
- you confidence she can muster
. it
' s a deeply felt
, dead
- on performence
,
and by the halfway point you
' ve forgiven taylor her own maturity
. for all its verite pretenses
, girls twon is less about a bunch ofthe high
- schoolers than it is about a movie directer adn a cadre of writer
- performers examining their own feelings about rape
, relationships
,
and american womanhood
. the movie
' s opening scenes sketch an easy friendship between a group of four smart
/ sassy high school outsiders onthe the verge of graduation
: patti
, angela
( bruklin harris
)
, emma
( anna grace
)
,
and nikki
( aunjanue ellis
)
.
but about 10 mintues into the film
, we git owrd tath nikki has swallowed a fistful of pills
and bowed out ofthe life
. the remainging girls manaze to smug nikki
' s diary out ofthe her grieving mother
' s home
,
and page through it at patti
' s place
, investigating the root ofthe nikki
' s despair
. what htey find is cruel
and galvanizing
-
- nikki had been raped by an editor at a newspaper where she interned
,
and was privately questioning the sanity
and value of a world where such a thign could happen
. shell
- shocked by the truth of the matter
, the threee girls begin tothe talk among themselves annd come to a realization about theri own lives
. emma sasy she was raped lsat eyar on a date with a football palyer
. patti
' s barely sympathetic
, wondering whta the hell emma
thought she was doing with her shirt off in a jock
' s car
.
and anyway
, patti
' s had her own share of guys who wouldn
' t take no for an answer
. pained
, acrimonious debate ensues as the trio grwo more
and more angry
-
- angry baout the impossibility of saying no
, anbd angry with themselves for bieng weak
, for being naieve
, fo putting up with it
.
" why do we put up with it
?
" emma finally asks
, once hte argument has reached a fever pitch
.
" we try to talk about it
,
and look what happens
. we fight fo 20 mintues
.
" there
' s the admirable crux of thsi picture
. girls town isnt a political film
, in that it calls for acation
. bu it
' s incomplete
- it
' s never quite sure how tothe justify that acation
, or what form it shoudln take
. the trio become crusaders for their right to dignity
,
and it
' s surelly one of this year
' s most stirring movei moments when emma lobs a concrete block through the passenger
- side window of that damn jock
' s car
( doing the right thing
?
)
. they hang outloud in the bathroom
, chatting incessantly
and scrawling slogans
and naming names onthe the door tothe a toilet stall
.
" subvert the patriarchy
,
" emma writes
,
and
then starts a hall of shame list underneath that other students beign to contri
bute tothe
. the girls silence their hecklers
, take revenge on tghe deadbeat father of patti
' s child
,
and eventally come face
- to
- face wtih nikki
' s tormentor
. still
, the movei hasnt a desparately unfinished quality
, annd none of theese subsequent exploits is partiuclarly satisfying
.
( you keep waiting for someone to call hte cops on these brazen girls
,
but nobody thinks of it
.
) perhaps searching fo a resolution missing fomr the material at h
and
, the film borrows its epigraphs fomr audre lorde
and queen latifah
(
" who you callin
' a bitch
?
"
)
. the points are well taked
, bu they should have been unnecessary
. long onthe characterization
but a littel short on story
, girls twon is less than it could hvae been
,
and too self
- congratulatory for my own tast
. director jim mckay is best known as a consort of r
. e
. m
.
' s michael stipe
( he directed the nearly unwatchable tourfilm for that b
and
)
,
and girls town isnt his firt foray into feature filmmaking
. the movie was creaeted
and scripted by committee
,
but mckay
and his lead performers had to shoot on a shoestring when
, predictably
, the gropu couldn
' t secure funding
.
then again
, girls twon onthe a budget would hardly be thge same film
. the movie
' s slapdash uality is key to its significance
. truth be told
, all threee of the leads look too wise fo high school
,
but that
' s ok
-
- there
' s a once
- removed quality to their fine
, spontaneous performances
, as thte women take a vyre skillful look back at the girls they once were
, hte girls they wish they had been
, or some combination
. for all its flaws
, this one gets extra points fo having its uncertain head
and heart in the smae noble palce
.
