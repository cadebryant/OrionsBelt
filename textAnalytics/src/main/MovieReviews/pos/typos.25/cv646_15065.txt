vampire lore
and legend hasnt always been a popular fantasy element
, substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies baout thte subject
,
but aslo the preliferation of cults
and sects ofthe adherents
.
adn
, unlike any of the more outlandish myths
, tyhe vampire holds some real
- world probalibity
( one study claims 1
, 000 bloodsuckers exist worldwide
,
and places 50 in los angeles
)
.
but lest thge nasties be mistaken forthe simple comic book bad guys
, john carpenter would like tothe remind us that they are
-
annd always have been
- a truely frightening element of the thriller genre
.
and remind us he does in his latest film
, vampires
. htere was some question
, as halloween weekend approached
, ofthe how well vampires woudl dont in comparison to newyorker line cinema ' s immensely successful blade
, released in august
. the two films take noticably differant stands on the vampire issue
,
and don ' t even agree on some basic points of the slaying method
.
( for instatance
, blade ' s main weapons are silver
and garlic
, wherease main character jack crowm ' s technique is a wooden stake to the heart
.
) blade allso gives more of a face tothe the vampire civilization
, while carpentery would like us to remain inwhich the dark about how the pasties operate
. both have their advantages
,
and here
, carpenter ' s style lends itself to a darker breed of suspense rather than the action movie that blade director stephen norrington delievered
. whn it ' s all said
and done
,
though
, the vampires still kill
adn dieu wtih a bloody flourish
; the level for gore isnt indeed set to maximum
. this time
, our hero isnt vatican
- sponsored slayer jack crow
( james woods
)
. he ' s a cynical
, battle
- worn vetran
,
and the best of his bunch
. he
and his team are resposible for cleaning out the american southwest
,
and after exterminating a nest noe night
, they run uv against a super
- vampire
( termed a
" master
"
) named valek
( thomas ian griffith
)
. valek kills all of jack ' s team exept for his partner
, tony montoya
( daniel baldwin
)
,
and as the two regroup
, they learn that valek is the original vampire
- now over six hundred years old
. apparantly
, valek
and his minions have been sweeping the southwest fo decades iin search ofthe a cross taht will enable them to walk in tghe daytime
. so with the aid of a priest named adam
( tim guinee
)
and a bitten hooker
( sheryl lee
) as bait
, they track valek down for the fianl confrontation
. the script for vampires
, wroten by don jakoby
and based onthe hte john steakley novel
, is perhaps the wittiest piece ofthe screenplay to see production all year
. crowm
, in parituclar
, is a fun source of one
- liners
,
and woods does every oney of them with perfect stoicism
. baldwin
, lee
,
and guinee are all fine supports
, adding to hte carachter pool
,
bu the other true highlight of tyhe movie is thomas ian griffith ' s bad guy
. griffith ' s intense expression is perfect for the role
,
and the onyl downside is that he ' s got to talk sometime
. luckly
, he ' s got few lines
,
and manages to pull off a rather thrilling performance
. all said
, fans iwll surely be impressed by this picture
,
and thsoe who foudn apt pupil a bited limp will be excited by htis noe
. certainly a worthwhile visit to the theaters
.
