vampire lore
and legend hasnt always beeen a popular fantasy element
, substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies about the subject
,
but also the proliferation of cults
and sects of adherents
.
and
, unlike any of the more outl
andish myths
, the vampire holds some real
- world probability
( noe studdy claims 1
, 000 bloodsuckers exist worldwide
,
and places 50 in los angeles
)
.
but lest the nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys
, john carpentery would like to remind us that they are
-
and always have beeen
- a truly frightening element of yhe thriller genre
.
and remind us he does in his latest film
, vampires
. htere was smoe question
, as hallowene weekend approached
, of how well vampires would do in comparsion tothe new line cinema
' s immensely sucessfull blade
, released infront august
. tyhe two films take noticably different st
ands on tyhe vampire issue
,
and don
' t even agree on some basic points of teh slaying method
.
( forthe instance
, blade
' s main weapons are silver annd garlic
, wherease main character jack crow
' s technique is a wooden stake to tyhe heart
.
) blade also gives more of a face to the vampire civilization
, while carpenter owudl like us to remain in the dark about how the pasties operate
. both have their advantages
, annd here
, carpenter
' s style lends itself to a darker breed ofthe suspense rather than the action movei tath blade director stephen norrington delievered
. when it
' s all said
and done
,
though
, the vampires still kill
and die with a bloody flourish
; the levle fo gore isnt indeed set to maximum
. this tiome
, our hero is vatican
- sponsored slayer jack crow
( james woods
)
. he
' s a cynical
, battle
- worn veteren
, annd the best of his bunch
. he adn his team are reponsible forthe cleaning out the american southwest
,
and after exterminating a nest one night
, they run up agaisnt a super
- vampire
( termed a
" master
"
) named valek
( thomas ian griffith
)
. valek kills all ofthe jack
' s team except for his partner
, tony montoya
( daniel baldwin
)
,
and as the two regroup
, they learn that valek is tyhe original vampire
- nowe over six hundred yeras old
. apparently
, valek
and his minions ahve been sweeping the southwest for decades in seach of a cross that will enable them tothe walk in the daytime
. so withthe the aid of a priest named adam
( tim guinee
)
and a bitten hooker
( sheryl lee
) as bait
, they trakc valek down for the fianl confrontation
. the script for vampires
, writen by don jakoby anbd based on the john steakley novel
, is perhasp the wittiest piece of screenplay to see production all year
. crowm
, in particular
, is a fun source of noe
- liners
,
and woods does every oen of them with perfect stoicism
. baldwin
, lee
, adn guinee are all fine supports
, adding to tghe character pool
,
but the other true highlight of tje movie is thomas ian griffith
' s bad guy
. griffith
' s intense expression is perfect for the role
,
and the only downside is that he
' s got to talk sometime
. luckily
, he
' s got few lines
,
and manages tothe pull off a rather thrilling performance
. all said
, fans will surely be impressed by this picture
, anbd thsoe who found apt pupil a bit limp will be excited by this one
. certainly a worthwhile visit to the theaters
.
