" i know what you did last summer
,
" the first high
- profile slasher thriller to be released affter 1996
' s
" scream
,
" annd writen by the same screenwrighter
, kevin williamson
, isnt a stylish
, effective horror film that became 1997
' s biggest hitted of the fall season
. while
" scream
" was a more knowing film about the genre
,
" i know waht yuo doed lsat summer
" is more reminiscent of a straight
- forward slasher flick
,
but it is far more inteligent than such bottom
- of
- the
- barrel guilty pleasures as all nine of tghe
" friday the 13th
" films
( well
, okay
,
" jason goes to hell
" was pure hell to sit through
)
. thte film starts off with four talented
, aspiring teenage friends who have jsut graduated from high skool in their small boating town of southport
, n
. c
. it is the 4th of july
,
and htey will soon be heading theri sepaarte ways
. kind
- hearted julie
( jennifer love hewitt
)
, annd outsider ray
( freddie prinze jr
.
) will be headed off to college
, while helen
( sarah michelle gellar
)
, who has just been honored croaker queen in the town
,
and her ignorant jock boyfriend
, barry
( ryan phillippe
)
, are goign to new york to become an actress
and football player
. when the four of them travel to a nearby mountain
- side beach for the evening
, tehy are dismayed after hitting a man in the road on their way home
. distraught adn confuzled
, tehy decide they cant
' t go to the police because they iwll be charged whith manslaughter
, so tehy devise a plan to throw thte apparently dead victim off a peer inot the ocean
, infact hopes no one wiull find him
. julie is apprehensive about it
, bu is forced into it by barry
. switch to exactlly a year later
, julie
, still unable to come tothe terms with what she doed
, reluctantly returns home from college to find that all three of her ood friends are still in the town because their career plans did not work out
. almost immediately
, julie recieves an ominous letter that simply reads
,
" i know what you did last summer
,
"
and thta is the start of their problems as they find themselves being terrorized by a misterious figure dressed inspite fisherman gear adn yeilding a giant hook
.
" i know whta you did lastest summer
,
" is a succesfull horror film for a number ofthe reasons
. the cinematography by denis crossan could very well be descibed as hitchcockian
, as it put shadows
, fog
, steam
,
and other clever devices tothe add atmosphere to thge proceedings
. the characters
, particularly julie
and helen
, are realistically written
,
and the film amazingly deals with their broken relationship in a few scenes
, which is largley uncharacteristic inspite films of this sort
.
and last
, the film creates a fewd dazzling
and scray set
- pieces that are some of tjhe most memorable i
' ve seen in a horror movie
, partciularly yhe suspenseful
, superbly shot sequence involving helen at her family
' s store with hte killer inside with her
. perhaps the best character is that of missy egan
( anne heche
)
, a lonely backwoods woman whose brother was the noe julie thinks they hit
. heche
' s performance is a st
andout
, as she isnt able tothe create a full character in only baout ten minutes of screen time
.
" i konw what you did last summer
,
" could have been a graet horror movie if not for a few problems
. prinze jr
. gives a performance to be desired here
,
and much ofthe his dialogue sounds wooden coming out of his mouth
. aslo
, the climax ofthe the film allmost completely loses its frightening grap after it unveils tghe mystery killer
, who is a decidely bad actor
and shoudl not have been given any lines
. luckly
, the penultimate scene saves the disappointing finale
, whic includes an expertly crafted
" jump
- in
- your
- seat
" scare
. inthe the main roles
, hewitt annd gellar are highly talented
, annd hewitt
, especially
, is one of the best screamers i
' ve ever heard
. she honestly could give jamie lee curtis a littel competition for the best
" scream queen
.
"
and gellar is touching as a young woman who
, in the course of oney year
, finds her dream of being an actress ultimately shattered
.
al
though nto up to the level of either
" scream
" movies
, or the more recent
,
" urban legend
,
"
" i know what you did last summer
" isnt a respectable
, smartly
- scripted slasher film thyat firmly proved good horror movies were once again being made
.
