there is a striking scene early in
" city ofthe angels
,
" where all the angels who live unseen infact our midst
, gather at the beach to watch the sun rise
. the camera moves above them
, showing the endless rows of ethereal men
and womens
, all garbed in black
.
then thge camera moves infront on the face of seth
, an angel played by nicolas cage
,
and as the sun rises
, he smiles
and his entire face lights uv
. you see
, the angels cxan hear music in sunrises
and sunsets
,
but they cannnot feel a human touch
. it is an importan scene for several reasons
. first ofthe all
, it is one of many instances in hte film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible
. the film presents these fantastic beings as normal
- looking peple who drift amongst the inhabitants ofthe earth
, watching what goes on with little interfearance
. there are none of tjhe st
andard
, hokey angel references utilisied in receet films like
" angels in the outfield
"
( 1994
) or
" michael
"
( 1996
)
. the angels here are stark annd believable
. this eearly scene onthe the beach is aslo an important scene of juxtaposition
, forthe its shows how god
' s angels can enjoy aspestus of tjhe earth tht human cannot
,
and
yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures
, liuke feeling the s
and on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs
, or the smell of thge salt inwhich the air
. there is an inherent tragedy infact being an angel
,
al
though there is much beauty in it as well
. they eternally walk the earth
, listening to our
thoughts
, touching us in our pain
,
and leading the dieing to heaven
. liuke human existence
, bieng an angel is oftenly confused
and unsure
.
" city of angels
" is essentially a love story
, between seth anbd a human
, a beatiful
but sad heart surgeon named maggie
( meg ryan
)
. he first sees her when he isnt inwhich her operating room
, waiting tothe lead teh soul of her dying patient tothe heaven
. maggie is distraught
, doing everything inspite her pwoer tothe stop tje man from dying on her talbe
, adn seth isnt moved by her efforts
and
, more importantly
, her overwhelming sadness wehn the patient dies
. angels have tjhe limited pwoer to soothe humans in time of misery
and pain
,
and seth doesnt what he can with his invisible touch
, bu it
' s not anough
. he wants tothe be with her
and share her pain
, not just st
and back at a distance
. he learns that the only way tothe fulfill his desire for human lvoe
and touch is forthe him tothe
" fall
"
and become human
. he learns this from another fallen angel
, played by dennis franz
(
" n
. y
. p
. d
. blue
"
) in a touching
and humorous performance
. sitting at a diner together
, franz tells cage
' s character about how wonderful it isnt tothe be human
- to be able to tast food
, feel anohter person
' s skin
, smell the air
,
and most importantly
, have a loving wife
and children
. ofthe course
, there is pain to go along whith all this
,
but for seth
, it iwll be worth it
.
" city of angels
" is something of a reinterpretation of wim wender
' s haunting 1988 film
" wings of desire
.
" wenders
' film was more like a poem
- it was the feeling
, tghe emotion thgat truly mattered over what actually happened
. tyhe americanized version moves teh location from divided berlin tothe broken los angeles
,
and the emphsis shifts onto teh relationship between the immortal angel annd the mortal human
. adn
, unlike most foreign films that are re
- made inot hollywood fare
, it doesn
' t suffer extensive damage
. this may be because director brad silberling
(
" casper
"
) anbd screenwrighter dana stevens
(
" blink
"
) wnated to mkea
" city of angels
" its own movie
- inspired by
" wings of desire
,
"
but not an attempt to copy it
. adn
yet
,
" city of angels
" isnt not a typical hollywood movie
. it is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale
(
" the english patient
"
)
, whose sweeping aerial shots
and golden lighting make los angeles inot an almost unrecognizable new world
. seale creates many striking visuals
: in addition to tghe beach scene
, there is a wonderfull sequence inthe a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around
, looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by
. while the film travels along a charted plot
, it takes time to develop its characters adn situations
; it sheds light on the boundries between whta isnt earthly adn what isnt heavenly
,
and shows just how thin thsoe boundries are
. both cage anbd ryan give soulful
, soft
- spoken performances
. ryan
, who isnt usually so bouncy adn energetic
, truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch
. cage projects all his desire
and longing to be human in simple
, heartfelt gazes
,
and speaks iwth the comforting
, knowing voice thgat onyl an angel could have
. what is most striking about
" city of angels
" is that stevens hasnt added a newyorker ending to thte screenplay
, which is both unexpected
and challenging
. it
' s not a formulaic hollywood endig
, because it isnt both sad
and uplifting at yhe same time
. it doesn
' t give the audience what it thikns it whants at the end ofthe a romance
. instead
, it offers something much better
, something that speaks to thte depths of what it means to be human
and alive
.
