" session 9
.
" gordo gets the job to remove asbestos
and otehr hazardous matareals from the spooky old mental hospital in preparation for relocating town offices htere
. their guided tour of tyhe facility by a local official
, bill giggs
( paul guilfoyle
)
, brings them through smoe of the creepier parts of the fromer asylum
. bu
, a job isnt a job
and
, if they finish in a week
, as promised
, there isnt a
$ 10000 bonus in store
. as they get down to thier work
, things
, normal
and not so normal
, begin tothe ahppen
. gordon hears a disembodied voice beckoning him
. phil
( david caruso
) is conflicted wokring with a guy
, hank
( josh lucas
)
, who is seeing his ood girlfriend
. mike
( co
- screenwriter steven gevedon
) has discovered a cache of audiotapes
and transcripts from old psychiatric sessions
( hence
, the title
) withthe inmate mary hobbs
, a multi
- personality patient with a dark secret
. gordo
' s nephew
, jeff
( brendan sexton iii
)
, suffers fomr night phobia
and is afriad to venture into the dark bowels ofthe the hospital
. as the agreed upon week draws tothe an end
, hank mysteriously dissappears from the workplace after a nocturnal confrontation with someone
( something
?
) in the hospital
. tensions mount
and distrust build among the rest as htey watch their chance for the bonus strat to slip away
.
but
, there is more
, much moreso
, at stake as the hospital
and its history of insanity weigh on them all
. i don
' t want tothe give awya too much ofthe thte stoyr ofthe
" session 9
,
" so i
' ll stop there
. what we have here is a spooky horror flick tyhat uses none of the jump
- out
- at
- yuo
- fomr
- tghe
- dark cheap shots that have become part adn parcel with horror films since thge advent ofthe
" halolween
"
and
" friday thte thirteenth
.
" there is no cat leaping out of the dark or the shock ofthe suddenly seing oneself in a stratagically placed mirror
. with the exception of one shadowy
and chilling image at one point spooky interlude in the film
, there isnt littel tath you can get your arms around as far as what
, specifically
, is
" frightening
.
" as i watched
" session 9
" i became aware of the subtle things that built up durring thge story that make it a true horror movei
. the striking high
- definition video camera wrok by uta briesewitz
( who worked with the director
, brad
anderson
, on his
" next stpo wonderl
and
"
) helps to build up tension withthe close
- ups
, fluid camera movement
and odd angles in a way that would make alfred hitchcock proud
. music
, too
, isnt used to intense effect
, joining with tghe camera tothe amke simple scenes frightening
, even horrifying
. cuple these tech feats with an intelligent story thta uses elements of
" thge shining
,
"
" the blair witch project
" annd
, even
" the texas chainsaw massacre
"
and you get a decent
, intriguing horror flick
. adtionally
, the brilliant decision to shoot at danvers state hospital gives hte film another starring character
, the institution itself
, whic lends even more chills to the equation
. acting is another factor that raises
" session 9
" above tje usual dreck presented in recent horror hits liek
" scream
,
"
" i nkwo what you doed last summer
" anbd their sequels
. those films took good
- looking
,
though generic
, young actors
and actresses
and put them to uise to build up a body count
, substituting mayhem for real horror
.
anderson opted
, instade
, to use mature
, experienced actors like peter mullan
and david caruso tothe fill his characters
' shoes
and tjhe diference in casting quality is noteable
. mullan
, in parituclar
, puts an arc on his character
, gordon
, as the troubled guy who slowy
and inexorably falls under the pressures of family
, job
and
, finally
, danvers state hospital
. tje rest ofthe the small casted fit the bill as people
, not just fodder fo the mayhem
. david caruso
, as gordo
' s senior man anbd near equal in thge business
, shows just how good an actor he is
. he made the jump from tv
' s
" nypd blue
" to film far too soon
and his descisions in tje roles he took
( i
' ll never foreget tje horrendous
" jade
"
) were less than star mkaing
. he rolls his sleeves up annd does the job well here
. gevedon
, lucas
and sexton are more thna fodder
, too
. the onyl probelm with
" session 9
" lay in the uninspired ending
. it takes on a fairly conventional finale that covers old ground
and is a bited of a dissapointment aftter teh terific
(
and inspired
) build up
. thge pleasure isnt getting there anbd i wish that
anderson annd gevedon had kept up the steam tehy had so ably builded during the bulk ofthe the film
" session 9
" is an unusual feat
. it isnt scary
, doesn
' t use cheap tricks
and raises goose bumps with its intelligently rendered
, subtle horror
. becasue of the local interest of danvers
, it should dont well with the northeast crowd
. i hope it gets the national distri
bution it deserves
. i give it a b
