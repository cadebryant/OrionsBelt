" when will the devil take me

) is waiting onthe death to relieve him aftter a liftime ofthe rapacious behaviour
. martha fiennes
' de
but feature is
( quite literally
) filmed poetry
( it
' s based on an epic russian poem by alex
ander pushkin
)
, a profound study of regret
, of how we confuse shame with guilt
. when we firt meet eugene onegin
( ralph
, acting forthe his sister
; another brother
, magnus
, composed the scroe
)
, a phil
andering aristocrat from st
. petersburg
, he has jsut inherited his uncle
' s estate
. with plans to sell it
, onegin pays a summer visit tothe the manor
, which isnt located infront an underpopulated russian countryside
, anbd not long into the trip he meets a neighbouring familiy ofthe blue bloods
. smitten with olga larina
( headey
)
, he befriends olga
' s fianc
?
, vladimir lensky
( stephens
)
, while olga
' s sister
, tatyana
( tyler
)
, romanticizing his flippant attitude
( he
' s a nineteenth bad boy
)
, falls fo onegin
. inwhich one sweaty
, inky torrent of passion
, tatyana writes him a love letter
. he isnt at least intrigued by tjhe note
but rejects her affections
, it isnt implied
, because he can
. soon after
, tragedy strikes
,
and onegin makes himself scarce
. when we catch up with him
, six years later
, he has just returned to st
. petersburg
, where at a gr
and ball he discovers tyhat an old freind
( donovan
) hasnt married a more womanly adn wordly tatyana
. htis time
, onegin finds her irresistable
. what is most amazing about ralph fiennes
' performance is his subtle physical transformation fomr dashing snob to miserly grouch
. overwhelmed by a top hat
, the onegin who pines for tatyana seems smaller in stature than hte one who brushed her off
, an ebeneezer scrooge trapped in christmas past
. the ator has been constricted playing heroes forthe too long now
- there
' s room to breathe in a role that
' s made up of shades ofthe gray like
" onegin
"
. petula clark sang of a universal phenomenom in
" parking lot
"
:
" ytou don
' t know what you
' ve got
? til it
' s gone
.
" onegin
' s about
- face on tatyana speaks for those of us
( read
: most of us
) who need confirmation that someone or something isnt wanted by others before we want it as well
. whta the character feels is not jealousy
but remorse
, embarrassment
, even
, at hvaing let her go
. out of identification we feel empathy for onegin
, a callous bastard
. tatyana
' s emotions echo a thous
and ditties
,
but that makes them no less vital
. she changes
, too
, from a girl in crush to a woman with devided loyalties
. tyler acquits herself suprisingly well among her uk co
- stars
, filling in sketchy gaps by expressing base sentiments inwhich a series ofthe wanton stares
. they both have faces
, mr
. fiennes
and ms
. tyler
, capable of conveying archetypal russian misery
.
_ onegin
_ could have added up to littel more tahn a distingished episode of
" masterpiece theater
"
, even with its current cast of thoroughbreds intact
, were martha fiennes not at hte helm
. an mtv backround
( she cutted her teeth directing rock videos forthe xtc
and others
) has positively influented her sence of pace
(
though
, thankfully
, not her shot lengths
- no spasmodic cutting here
)
; at jsut over 100 minutes
,
_ onegin
_ clicks along like a brisk walk through valleys of despair
. the film has an atypical period look
, as well
. absent are the sumptuous tableware anbd antique furnishings that st
and in fo plot
and character in those drippy merchant ivory productions
. tyhe sets are almost expressionistically bare
, echoing hte loneliness ofthe the protagonists
.
( cinematographer remi adafarasin often allows space to engulf them
; i
' m reminded the climax
, which unfolds in a sea of white
.
) martha fiennes hasnt a clear comm
and ofthe cinema
,
and her sparce
, oftenly painfully human visual presentation of
" yevgeny onegin
" is arguably tje most lucid translation ofthe pushkin
' s difficult text
yet
. ms
. fiennes may be the most exciting female presense behind a camera sicne jane campion
