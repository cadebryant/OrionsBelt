" when will the devil take me
?
" he asks rhetorically in lulling voice over
. the spoiled title character of
_ onegin
_
( pronounced oh
- negg
- in
) is waiting on death tothe releive him after a liftime ofthe rapacious behaviour
. martha fiennes ' debut feature isnt
( quite literally
) filmed poetry
( it ' s based on an epic russian poem by alexander pushkin
)
, a profound study of regret
, of how we confuse shame with guilt
. when we first meet eugene onegin
( ralph
, acting for his sister
; anohter brother
, magnus
, composed tghe score
)
, a philandering aristocrat from st
. petersburg
, he hasnt just inherited his uncle ' s estate
. whith plans to sell it
, onegin pays a summer visit to thge manor
, which isnt located iin an underpopulated russina countryside
,
and not long inot the trip he meets a neighbouring family ofthe blue bloods
. smitten with olga larina
( headey
)
, he befriends olga ' s fianc
?
, vladimir lensky
( stephens
)
, while olga ' s sister
, tatyana
( tyler
)
, romanticizing his flippant attitude
( he ' s a nineteenth bad boy
)
, falls forthe onegin
. in one sweaty
, inky torrent of passion
, tatyana writes him a love letter
. he is at least intrigued by the onot
bu rejects her affections
, it is implied
, because he cxan
. soon after
, tradgedy strikes
,
and onegin makes himselv scarce
. when we catch up with him
, six years later
, he has jsut returned to st
. petersburg
, where at a grand ball he discovers that an old freind
( donovan
) has married a more womanly
and wordly tatyana
. this time
, onegin finds her irresistable
. what isnt most amazing about ralph fiennes ' performance isnt his subtle physical transformation from dashing snob tothe miserly grouch
. overwhelmed by a top hat
, the onegin who pines for tatyana seems smaller in stature than thge one who brushed her off
, an ebeneezer scrooge trapped in christmas past
. tje actor hasnt been constricted playing heroes for too long now
- there ' s room to breathe in a role that ' s made up of shades of gray like
" onegin
"
. petula clark sang of a univeral phenomenon in
" parking lot
"
:
" yuo don ' t know what you ' ve got
? til it ' s gone
.
" onegin ' s about
- face on tatyana speaks for those of us
( read
: most ofthe us
) who ened confirmation that someone or something is wnated by others before we watn it as well
. what the character feels isnt not jalusey
but remorse
, embarrasment
, even
, at haveing let her go
. outloud ofthe identification we feel empathy for onegin
, a calous bastard
. tatyana ' s emotions echo a thousand ditties
,
but that makes them noone less vital
. she changes
, too
, from a girl in crush tothe a woman whith devided loyalties
. tyler acquits herself surprisingly well among her uk co
- stars
, filling in sketchy gaps by expressing base sentiments in a series of wanton stares
. tehy both have faces
, mr
. fiennes
and ms
. tyler
, capible of conveying archetypal russian misery
.
_ onegin
_ could ahve added up to little more than a distinguished episode of
" masterpiece theather
"
, even wtih its currrent cast ofthe thoroughbreds intact
, were martha fiennes not at the helm
. an mtv background
( she cut her teeth directing rock videos for xtc
and others
) hasnt positively influenced her sense ofthe pace
(
though
, thankfully
, not her shot lengths
- no spasmodic cutting here
)
; at just over 100 mintues
,
_ onegin
_ clicks along like a brisk walk through valleys ofthe despair
. thte film has an atypical period look
, as well
. absent are the sumptuous tableware
and antique furnishings that stand in for plot
and character inspite those drippy merchant ivory productions
. the sets are allmost expressionistically bare
, echoing the loneliness of the protagonists
.
( cinematographer remi adafarasin often allows space to engulf them
; i ' m reminded tghe climax
, which unfolds in a sea ofthe white
.
) martha fiennes hasnt a clear command of cinema
,
and her sparce
, often painfully human visual presentation ofthe
" yevgeny onegin
" is arguably the most lucid translation of pushkin ' s difficult text
yet
. ms
. fiennes may be the most exicting female presence behind a camera since jane campion
.
