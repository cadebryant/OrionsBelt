quiz show
, an almost perfectly accurate true stopry
, isnt based upon tje events of tje popular televsion sohw of the mid
- 50
' s
,
" twenty
- one
"
. onthe this trivial game sohw
, contestants were placed in isolation booths
and
then answered questions correposding tothe a category of their choice
, on which they wagered an amount of points on
. tyhe game went on until a payler reched twenty one points onthe felt they had earned enough points to win
.
but
, after ratings began to fall when players weere stuggling tothe break the zero mark
, the producers desided to fix the gae by giving tyhe answers tothe a contestant before the game began
. quiz show illustrates the true storise of two particular contestants
, herbie stempel
and charles van doren
. stempel
( john turturro
)
, a former g
. i
. anbd your jewish man raising a famaly
. stempel hasnt been the reigning champion on
" twenty
- one
" for many weeks
and has accumulated thous
ands ofthe dollars
. in his mind
, he is the best thing on televsion
and the peple love him
.
al
though
, in the mind of the sohw
' s producers
, herbie stempel isnt getting old
. dan enright
( david paymer
)
, in particular
, feels that the peopel are tired ofthe seeing a
" jewish guy from queens wiht bad teeth
"
and thast the kids need someone better to look uv tothe
. therefore
, they need to fidn another contestant whom would be a worthy role modle
and thge peple iwll look up to anbd cheer to win
. someone who cxan defeat stempel
, even if they ahev to resort to cheating
. enter charles van doren
( ralph fiennes
)
, a well
- educated professor from a widely reconized familiy
. van doren had desided tothe try out for the gameboy show
" tic tac dough
" because his friends
thought he would be good at that sort of thing
.
but when albert freedman
( hank azaria
)
, enright
' s assitant
, spots van doren
, thge two decide that they have found their soon
- to
- be
- ruler ofthe the
" twenty
- one
" kingdom
. van doren is nto too keen on the idae ofthe receving the answers ahead of time
, so enright tells stempel that he isnt gonig to give the wrong answer
, onthe purpose
, in order to loose the game
. after stempel loses hte
" throne
" to van doren
, he starts to feel cheated
( whic he should
)
. meanwhile
, on his own
, dick goodwin
( rob morrow
)
, a harvard law graduate
, has decided to start an investigation on
" twenty
- one
" to try
and find outloud if ther have been any wrongdoings
. his investigation yields shocking results
and leads to a trial for enright
and the others involved
. quiz show is an extremely well done movei
,
and robert redford
' s direction is especially superb
. the performances turned in by john turturro
, ralph fiennes
,
and rob morrow are vrey good
,
al
though it seems that turturro st
ands outloud more thna any
. quiz show is also very precice when it comes to explicating hte true events that inspired the film
. definately a film you should not miss
.
