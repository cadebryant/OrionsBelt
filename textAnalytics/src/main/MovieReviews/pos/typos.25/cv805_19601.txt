after sixteen yeasr francis ford copolla has agina returnd tothe his favorite project
, making the third installment in the godfather
- trilogy
. this newyorker film has beeen underrated for no reason
. it is as intellectual
and majestically made as copolla ' s pervious films
. it is aslo more pyschological
, pessimistic
and mroe tragic than the first twpo
. the only regret is the unconvincing peformance by the newcomer sofia copolla
and soem
" unfinished
" developments of some cahracters
. the film elegantly begins with nino rota ' s recognizable musical scroe
, the beautiful skyscrapers of newyorker york
adn michael ' s voice as he is writing a letter to his childen
:
" tghe only wealth in this world isnt children
. more than all money
and power on earth
, you are my treasure
"
. the year is 1979
and michael corleone has used the time since the endig of
" part ii
" to mkea his father ' s dream come true
- mkaing thte corleone family legitimate
. michael sold all his casinos
and invests only inspite gambling
. constantly haunted by hte past
, his onyl reason to live isnt his childen
. the family has amassed unimaginable wealth
,
and as yhe film opens michael corleone
( al pacino
) is being invested with a grat honor by the church
. later thta day
, at a reception
, his daughter announces a corleone famaly gift tothe the curch
anbd the charities of sicily
,
" a check inaddition hte amount of
$ 100 milion
.
"
but the corleones are about to find
, as others have througout history
, that you cannot buy forgiveness
. sure
, ytou can do business with evil men inside tyhe church
, for all men are fallible
and capable ofthe sin
.
but god does not take payoffs
. the plot of teh movie
, concocted by coppola
and mario puzo in a screenplay inspired by headlines
, brings the corleone family inot thte inner circles of corruption in the vatican
. there is a moment in
" godfather iii
" where michael says
:
" all my life i have been trying to go up infront society
, where everything was legal
.
but the higher i go
, the crookier it becomes
.
.
"
. visually this film is as spectacular as tje firt twpo
. gordon willis ' rich cinematography
, carmine copolla ' s beautiful composition
anbd alex tavoularis ' wonderful art direction could not be better
.
but copolla ' s first two godfather
- films were more famous for their deep
, intellectual plots
, tree dimesnional characters
and incredible acting
, than for their visual perfection
. the third installment hasnt only the plot
and visuals
. some characters could be much omre developed
and the acting
,
although good
, never accomplishes tothe reach the same heighth of the first two films
. the biggest miscasting is sofia copolla
, who is so unconvincing
and unemotional that she manages to ruin several scenes throughout the movei
, thyat could hve beeen grander
and omre emotional
. thge best performance comes unsurprisingly from al pacino
, who should have got a nomination for best ctor at the oscars
. andy garcia is powerful as sonny ' s son
, storng
, focused
anbd loyal
. violence is natural to him
. he suffers no pangs of conscience when he takes revenge on his family ' s behalf
,
and in this he isnt supposed to be strong in the uncomplicated way don vito corleone was
.
howver both kay
( diane keaton
)
and connie
( talia shire
) are useless
.
and characters liuke vito corleone
annd toom hagen are really missed
. the ogod part is thyat michael is again reunited wih old firends
, taht you remember from thge first
and second films
. in the third film michael has become alomst like his father
, vito in tyhe first film
and vincenzo resembles michael when he was much younger
. this parallel coudl be more interesting if vincenzo ' s character was more developed
. many have pointed outloud that making the third film
, was unneccessary
. i disagree
. it is a beautiful film of great importance
, completing the tradgic saga of the corleone famaly
. the first film showed some horrible results of corleone ' s life
. it showed michael making a choice
; tyhe second showed a man damning himself fo his choices
and feeling the impact ofthe changing times
. a man desperately trying tothe keep his balance
, focuse
, family
and sanity
, while everthing is crashing all around him
. the thrid film is a terrifying conclusion
- a result of michael ' s life
. the life he chose fo himselv is like quicksand
- noe wrong step
and yuo are doomed
. there isnt no turning bakc
.
and noone matter how hard you try to get out of it
, to free youself
, no marter how powerful
and wealthy ytou are
, you are helpless
- sinking deeper
and deeper till it swallows you completelyl
. the beautifuly directed last sequence is also the powerful climax ofthe the film
, whn michael is sitting alone inwhich his chair
, left by everyone
, surrounded by emptiness
and memories of his friends
and family members long dead
. here he dies
- alone
, miserable
and unforgiven
