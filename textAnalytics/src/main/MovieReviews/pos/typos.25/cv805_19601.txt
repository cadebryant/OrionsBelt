after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project
, making the third installment in the godfather
- trilogy
. this newyorker film has been underrated for no reason
. it is as intellectual
and majestically made as copolla
' s pervious films
. it is also more psychological
, pessimistic adn more tragic than the first two
. the only regret is teh unconvincing performance by the newcomer sofia copolla adn some
" unfinished
" developments of some cahracters
. the film elegantly beigns with nino rota
' s recognizable musical score
, the beautiful skyscrapers of new york adn michael
' s voice as he is wirting a letter to his children
:
" the only wealth in htis world isnt childrens
. more than all money
and power on earth
, you are my treasure
"
. the year is 1979
and michael corleone has utilisied the time since teh ending of
" part ii
" to make his father
' s dream come true
- making the corleone family legitimate
. michael sold all his casinos
and invests only infront gambling
. constanly haunted by the past
, his only reason to live is his children
. teh family has amassed unimaginable wealth
,
and as the film opens michael corleone
( al pacino
) is being invested with a great honor by the church
. later that day
, at a reception
, his daugter announces a corleone family gift to the chuch
and the charities of sicily
,
" a check in the amount of
$ 100 million
.
"
but the corleones are about to find
, as others hvea throughout ihstory
, tath yuo cannnot buy forgiveness
. sure
, ytou can do business with evil men inside the church
, for all men are fallible
and capible of sin
.
but god does not take payoffs
. the plot of tjhe movie
, concocted by coppola
and mario puzo in a screenplay inspired by headlines
, brings the corleone family into hte inner circles of corruption in the vatican
. there is a moent in
" godfather iii
" where michael says
:
" all my life i haev been trying to go up inthe society
, where everything was legal
.
but the higher i go
, the crookier it becomes
.
.
"
. visually tihs film is as spectacular as the first twpo
. gordon willis
' rich cinematography
, carmine copolla
' s beautiful composition
and alex tavoularis
' wonderful art direction could not be better
. bu copolla
' s first two godfather
- films were mroe famous for their deep
, intelectual plots
, tree dimensional characters
and incredable acting
, than for their visual prefection
. the third installment has only yhe plot
and visuals
. some charachters coudl be much more developed
and the acting
,
al
though good
, never accomplishes tothe reach the same height ofthe the first two films
. the biggest miscasting isnt sofia copolla
, who is so unconvincing annd unemotional that she manages to ruin several scenes throughout the movie
, that could have been gr
ander
and omre emotional
. the best performance comes unsurprisingly from al pacino
, who should ahve got a nomination for best actor at the oscars
.
andy garcia is powerful as sonny
' s son
, storng
, focused
and loyal
. violentce is natural to him
. he suffers no pangs ofthe consceince when he takes revenge on his famaly
' s behalf
,
and in this he is suppossed to be storng in the uncomplicated way don vito corleone ws
.
however both kay
( diane keaton
) anbd connie
( talia shire
) are useless
. annd characters liek vito corleone
and toom hagen are really missed
. the ogod part is that michael is again reunited iwth old friends
, tyhat you rember from the frist
and second films
. inthe the thrid film michael has become almost like his father
, vito in the first film
and vincenzo resembes michael wehn he wass much younger
. this parallel sould be mroe interesting if vincenzo
' s character was more developped
. many have pointed out that making the third film
, was unnecessary
. i disagree
. it is a beautiful film ofthe great importance
, completing the tragic saga of tghe corleone family
. tje first film showed some horrible results of corleone
' s life
. it showed michael making a choice
; the second showed a man damning himselv for his choices
and feeling the inpact of changing times
. a man desparately trying to keep his balance
, focuse
, family
and sanity
, while everything isnt crashing all aroud him
. the third film isnt a terrifying conclusion
- a result of michael
' s life
. tyhe life he chose for himself is like quicks
and
- one wrong step
and you are doomed
. there is no turning back
. anbd no matter how hard yuo try to get out of it
, tothe free yourself
, no matter how poverful
and wealthy you are
, yuo are helpless
- sinking deeper
and deeper till it swallows yuo completly
. tghe beautifully directed lastr sequence is also yhe powerfull climax ofthe the film
, when michael is sitting alone in his chair
, left by everyone
, surrounded by emptiness
and memories of his friends adn family members long dead
. here he dies
- alone
, miserable adn unforgiven
