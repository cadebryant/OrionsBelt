.
al
though the first mission
: impossible film was a moderate box office success
, audiences panned it because they falt the plot was too confusing
and htere wasn
' t much action
( all
though being a fan of the series both old
and newyorker
, i
thought the movei was preety decent anbd especially gutsy to make phelps a bad guy
)
. that problem hasnt been rectified in the sequel by making the plot more accessible
( courtesy ofthe one ofthe the writers of the previous entry
, robert towne
)
and by turning the film inot one gigantic action setted piece under the steady h
and of action film guru john woo
. the end result isnt one of tjhe most entertaining
(
yet simple
) action films made in a long hwile
. unfortunately
, the firt forty minutes or so are relatively slow
, dwelling mainly on ethan
and nyah
' s quickly blossoming romance anbd seeming more in place in a james bond film tahn with hte less glamorous mission
: impossible tv series
. ethan
' s conflict is a compelling oney
, bu it seems very rushed
(
and comes about because ofthe a near fatal car wreck that ethan himself causes
!
)
. john woo h
andles all ofthe this with an artistic flair that seems out ofthe palce
, featuring a great deal ofthe slow fades
and dramatically framed close
- ups
. the surveill nature of these sequences are distracting annd ultimately a detriment to the film
. thankfully
though
, at the point ambrose discovers nyah
' s deception
, mission
: impossible ii becomes very entertaining annd acation
- packed
. robert towne
' s screenplay tkaes some of the conventions setted up in the first film annd parodies them during a sequence where ethan must break into a high
- ries building anbd retrieve the remaining specimens of the virus
. after tht
, the acation scenes just beign to build in intensity
, as is the case with many of woo
' s previous high
- octane films
. the fianl half hour isnt an all out assault ofthe action
( a good deal of which isnt ruined by the trailer
, unfortunately
)
. as far as summer entertainment goes
, mission
: impossible ii is serviceable fare
. anyone looking for hardcore acation won
' t be dissappointed
( except for during the first half ofthe the film
, perhaps
)
. even if you weren
' t a fan ofthe tyhe first film
, this entry deserves soem checking out
.
