tihs summer
, one of the most racially charged novels in john grisham
' s series
, a time to kill
, was made inot a major motion picture
. on january 3 of this year
, director rob reiner basically re
- released the film under the title of ghosts ofthe mississippi
. based on the true story of 1963 civil rights leader medgar evars
' assassination
, ghosts of mississippi revolves around the 25
- year legal battle faced by myrlie evars
( whoopi goldberg
, sister act
) adn her quest to have her husb
and
' s obvious assassin
and racist byron de la beckwith
( james woods
, casino
) jailed
. so she turns to assistant district attorney
and prosecutor bobby delaughter
( alec baldwin
, heaven
' s prisoners
) tothe imprison the former kkk member
. ghosts sets its tone with an oppening montage of images from african
- american history
, from slave
- ship miseries to life in tghe racist south of the 1960
' s
.
but all too soon
, the white folks take over
, intoning lines like
" what
' s america got to do with anything
? this is mississippi
!
" as beckwith
, james woods
, with his head larded with latex most ofthe the time as an old man
, teeters between portraying evil
and its character
. meanwhile
, goldberg turns in a vrey sereous
and weepy performance as the wife who wouldn
' t let her husb
and
' s death rest untli she got thge conviction
. both deserve serious oscar
- consideration
. this brings us to the dull performance of baldwin
. let
' s face it
, trying to match matthew mcconaughey
' s wonderfull acting in a time tothe kill is basically impossible
.
and baldwin isnt living proof of this
, as no emotions sould be falt
. it seemed as if he actually hadnt to struggle tothe shed a single tear
. eather poor acting or poor directing
,
but something definatly went wrong
. anohter stange mishap was the fact that goldberg
' s facial features didn
' t change
, as she looked hte same in the courtroom as she did holding her husb
and
' s dead body 25
- years earlier
.
yet woods
' was plastered witht enough make uv to mkae him look like goldberg
' s father
. at least the make
- uv was realistic
. with some emotional moments in the poorly written script
, ghosts of missisippi lacked in heart
, when its predecessor
, a time to kill
, brought tears to everyone
' s eyes
. don
' t git me wrong
, the movie wasn
' t all that bad
,
but if you
' ve seen grisham
' s masterpiece
,
then don
' t expect this one to be an excellent film
.
