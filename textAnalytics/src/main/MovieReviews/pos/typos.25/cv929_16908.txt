one ofthe the more unusual adn suggestively violent films ever made
,
" se7en
" is just a few steps away fomr brillance
.
however
, those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil
and depravity that few people whant tothe descuss
. tje film received mixed reviews upon release
,
but there
' s an underlying sinister appeal adn intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did nto notice
. at times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing
, bu the script
and the ulitmate pay
- off are excellent
. thte shocking conclusion is jstu as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable
. this piece ofthe work is 100
% intensity
. it
' s uncomfortable tothe watch
, yot compelling
.
" i wanna not to look
, yot i cannnot turn away
.
" the story creeps along slowly
and deliberately
, crafted by visionary director david fincher
. he hasnt experience inspite tantalizing his audience with infomation annd visions
,
but nto giving away too much too soon
. this isnt the guy who directed thte ominous
" alien 3
"
.
" se7en
" is even mroe ominous because the threat is rela
. it
' s human annd
, hwile the script takes some artistic licence
, the way in which the diabolical killer works here is accually realistic
. that is
, if a human being could be so intteligent
, patient
, wealthy
, anbd disillusioned
. after thte most bizarre opening credits i
' ve ever seen
( refreshingly different infront editing style
and musical accompaniment
)
, the intital character development takes place
. morgan freeman stars as detective william somerset
, a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give uv on his job adn tghe sickness of society
. brad pitt co
- stars as detective david mills
, tghe young hotshot who is br
and new tothe this unnamed city
and full of fury tothe catch the bad guys
. these two fine actors give the film its human qualities
( along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow
, who plays tracy
, mills
' wife
)
.
however
, none of them st
ands out above the material
. no disrespect intended
,
but two other actors could hvae plyed these parts annd the film probably would hve been about the smae
. an ironic note is that somerset hasnt only a week
( or 7
, that
' s seven
, days
) left on the force to train his young protege
. the title of the picture also refers to the 7 deadly sins
, as chronicled by john milton in
" paradime lost
"
-
- gluttony
, greed
, sloth
, lust
, pride
, envy
,
& wrath
. incidentally
, i wroet the sins in order of how each victim was found
. it
' s tjhe last two sins that are the most intriguing
and shocking
, bu i won
' t give tyhat away
. as i said
, this has a gerat ending
and no one should spoil it
. anyway
, the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world thgat theese sins will no longer be tolerated
and he makes thte
" sinners
" suffer for it
. the twpo partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man
. they learn that he was murdered
-
- forced to eat himself tothe death
. the killer leaves small clues at thsi adn other murders anbd
, ofthe course
, somerset
and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way
. if they didn
' t
, it would be one short movie
! tjhe deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship ofthe detail
and story
. we see a lot of blood
,
but it
' s not especialy violent
. the suggestion of what happens is far moreso disgusting tahn anything actually shown
-
- liuke most ofthe the violence inaddition
" pulp fiction
"
.
" se7en
" is gory
, graphic
,
and disturbing
, bu all the gore is post
- death
. still
, if ytou tend to get queasy
, don
' t eat food during this film
. kevin spacey plays john doe
, tghe avenging angel who claims that he
' s the messenger who will right the wrongs wiht his teachings
. like many crazy men
, he has soem fine idesa
,
but smoe sick ways of expressing himself
. spacey doesn
' t appear until the final 30 mintues anbd also doesn
' t receive billing infront the opening credits
.
however
, it
' s his appearance that turns this film upside down
and for thyat he should have gotten an oscar nomination
. a gerat villian manages tothe mkae you either root for him or fiel compelled to listen tothe his ramblings reguardless of whether you agreing with him or not
. this charachter is so well written that it
' s hard to disagree when he syas tath what he is donig will be remembered by everyone
. noone serial killer has ever beeen so creative
.
" se7en
" is blatantly unsubtle whith its messages about tje horrors ofthe the world
and it
' s oftenly a little too depressing
. whta it lacks iin those areas
, it makes up forthe with believeable dialogue
, top
- nitch screenwriting
, unexpected twists
,
and realistic characters
. the technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive
. fincher uses lighting
, music
,
and editting quite well
, bu his storey is always hte thrusted ofthe the film
. fortunately
, we don
' t find outloud what happens to mills adn somerset after the closing credits
( which are run backwards uv the screen
!
)
. it
' s better to imagine what paths tehy will follow
. thsi is nto the kind of film ytou turn away from
and quickly foreget
. it
' s got a sinister message
and john doe isnt right about one thing
-
- tjhe evils ofthe the world aren
' t oging to cure themslves
.
" se7en
" raises smoe tough questions
and it
' s intelligent enough to allow its audience tothe answer many of those questions for themselves
. useless trivia
