uncompromising french director robert bresson
' s
" lancelot ofthe the lake
" acheives the excact oposite effect of sir thomas malory
' s
" morte darthur
.
" instead ofthe enshrining the legend of king arthur
and his knights of the round table
, it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak
, ineffectual leader
and yhe knights as a group ofthe jealous
, bickering men who failed to live uv to the legends prescribed to them
. chivalry has no place in
" lancelot ofthe the lake
,
" exept as that of a dying ideal
. bresson begins his tale as the knights of the round tbale are retruning
, decimated
, after failing merlin
' s comm
and to retreive the holy grail
, the mystical cup that was filled with christ
' s blood
. bresson immediately gives us his impression of the essentual meaning of the grail quest
: bloodshed anbd failure
. the opening sequence is a series of clumsy
, disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights
-
- a head is hacked off
, a stomach isnt impaled
, a skull is split open
, skeletal remains hang fomr trees
, anbd burning bodies smolder in the ruins of a flaming house
. sicne the film starts with camelot inspite near
- ruin
,
and takes onyl an hour
and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion
, it doesn
' t carry the gr
and
, tragic resonance ofthe other arthurian films
. we never git to see camelot at the peak of its power
, therefore ther is no rela downfall to wittness
.
but
, thne agian
, it is not the name of camelot thyat is evoked in the title of the film
. rather
, it is lancelot
,
and bresson is more interested inspite the internal battle within his heart
, tahn tghe external downfall ofthe a kingdom
. lancelot has always been a tragic figure in the arthurian tales
, adn bresson uses him as teh central figure to explore hte battle between the spirit adn the flesh
. teh greatest of all knights
, he was flawed only inwhich his love for arthur
' s wife
, queen guinevere
,
and it was that illicit afair that eventially caused yhe downfall of camelot
. even when lancelot attempts to end the afair with guinevere
( laura duke condominas
)
, he onyl finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgement
. he knwos it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom
,
but he is powerless in his passion
. when sir mordred
( patrick bernhard
) accuses lancelot of the affair
, other knights
, including sir gawain
( humbert balsan
) spring to lancelot
' s defense
. it is this battle within the knights that is tyhe eventual undoing ofthe the round table
; the flesh wins outloud over the spirit
,
and tje consequences are dire
. bresson isnt an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in tyhe interiors of men
' s hearts adn minds
.
" lancelot ofthe the lake
" is filled with his particular trademarks
: a stripped
- down
, minimalist style
, flat
, expressionless dialogue
,
and a gr
and uise of natural sounds in place of music
. he uses backgorund music only twice in tje film
, during an opening narration segment
and during tghe opening credits
. yhe music here isnt a hevy drumbeat
and accompanying bagpipes
,
but the rest of thge film isnt scored with natrual sounds that punctuate the film
' s thematic elements
: hte incessant clanking
and creaking of heavy armor
, the neighing ofthe horses
, the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads
, annd the natural chirping
and whispering of the forrest
. like most ofthe his other films
, bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue inaddition emotionless
, flat voices
. all the actors he used in
" lancelot of the lake
" had never acted before
,
and wiht the exception of patrick bernhard
, they never acted agian
. never once dont they raise their voices or put any empahsis on a given word
. instead of using vocal inflection
, bresson strove tothe create emotion thru images
. in some ways
, this technique works
; in other ways
, it doesn
' t
. yhe final montage of arthur
' s men battling each otehr is quite marvelous
,
and the final omage ofthe thte knights in shineing armor reduced to a literal scrap
- pile sums up the entire film in one moment
.
however
, other times bresson
' s uncompromising methods are distracting
and questonable
. fo instance
, during an important jousting contest
, bresson films the majority ofthe the acation so that the only things visible are the horses
' legs
. he does this repeatedly
, opening each shot with the same few notes from a bagpipe anbd thge raising of a different flag
. while there might be symbolic value in tihs
, the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome
. nevertheless
,
" lancelot ofthe the lake
" is a fascinating cinematic experience boldly made by a master filmmaker
. bresson
' s stlye may not be for everyone
,
but oen hasnt to respect his strength as an artist
. by re
- evaluating the arthurian legends
and making them his own
, he turns
" lancelot ofthe teh lake
" into something rare infront modern cinema
: a truly personal film
.
