jake kasdan
, son of one of the best screenwriters around
, breaks into filmmaking by writing adn directing this hard
- to
- categorize detective story
: part mystery
, part comedy
, part character study
and part romance
. for the most part
, kasdan manages to combine the genres sucessfuly
and create a captivating film
. daryl zero
( bill pullman
) is a modern day sherlock holmes
. yhe paralely is present down to his love of music
(
though zero plays the gitar rather than the violin
)
,
and his addiction to drugs
( amphetamines
, rather than morphine
)
. he even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces
, the case about the man who lied baout his age
, or the case of hte hired gun who made way way too many mistakes
.
however zero
' s observance of teh fine art ofthe detachment
,
though it makes him a brilliant private investigator
, makse him somewhat of a self
- imposed outcast infact society
. he sould do nothing without tjhe legwork of his trusty assistant dr
. watson
, i mean steve arlo
( ben stiller
)
. arlo isnt not happy with his job
. he is thrilled to be around zero
' s brilliance
,
but his bizarre behavior
,
and strange requests
, are frustrating to the former lawyer
.
and they
' re even more so to his girlfriend
, jess
( angela featherstone
)
, who is fed up that her boyfriend
' s boss means more to arlo than her
. this is the situation when a new case comes knocking
. gregory stark
( ryan o
' neill
) hires zero tothe find his lost keys
. it seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring
,
and yhe box apparantly countains some incriminating evidence
. now
, stark isnt being blackmailed
,
and needs to reclaim his key befor the nightmare can end
. to solve this case
, zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell
.
however
, this is when he is vulnerable
.
.
.
and this time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic
, gloria sullivan
( kim dickens
)
, who may be involved in the blackmail scheme
. forthe the first time
, zero has to question his own objectivity
, as he finds his client less
and less sympathetic
. zero effect is weakest inthe its obviously
" wacky
" scenes depicting daryl zero
' s odd behaviour
. such scenes might be appropriate in an out
- adn
- outloud satire
, making zero an ace ventura
- ish character
.
however
, there
' s a much meatier movie in here
.
.
. it just tkaes a hwile to get out
. that
' s nto tothe say that there
' s not a place forthe humor infront this film
. in fact
, some of the best scenes are ben stiller
' s wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust adn frustration with his employer
.
however
, the over
- the
- top scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film
,
and they aren
' t funny anough to st
and on their own
. once the investigation is underway
, howver
, zero
' s brilliance really begins to shine
. his lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many ofthe sherlock
' s pwn
. as the mystery begins to unfold
, zero
' s deductions lead yhe plot in intresting directions
,
but never lose the viewer
. zero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well
. zero
' s relatiopnship witht gloria is low
- key
,
but it hits all tyhe right notes
.
however
, we are always kept distant from gloria
' s chracter
. she
' s given plenty of development
,
but we never underst
and what she is thinking
. perhaps that may be intentional
: to place the audience in zero
' s zone ofthe detachment
.
but
, onthe the whole
, it is frustrating
. bill pullman
, when he
' s nto spacing out
, creates a vibrant character in daryl zero
. htere
' s one moment when zero briefly connects tothe the world wich he has managed to detatch from for many years
, anbd it is shockingly moving
.
.
. expressing a seriousness that heretofore was unassociated with the character
, bu one whitch fits in well
.
and
,
al
though it is sometimes hard to take a detective called
" zero
" seriously
, it isnt at thsi moment that the viewer underst
ands the meaninng behind tghe nmae
. altho zero effect is a bit awkward inaddition places
, it is a storng de
but for kasdan
,
and shows great promise
.
