i ws pleasantly surprized by this film
. with a budget topping
$ 200 millon
, i wass quite skeptical about whther throwing all that money towrad noe ofthe the twentieth century
' s greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough tothe see
. how much sould ytou dress up the sets
? how many models
and computer effects sould yuo use
? how much mroe action could you pack into a ship that sinks
? oh
, if i
' ve just given away part of the plot for you
, go bakc tothe school
. aftter having viewed titanic
,
however
, i found it to be a well
- paced
, well
- designed
,
and overall well
- made movie
. there have been many films made about the maiden
and final voyage ofthe yhe ocean liner titanic
,
but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i
' ve seen
. titanic tells its story in two time periods
. it starts out in the preent
, when ocean explorer brock lovett
( bill paxton
) anbd his team are exploring thge wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic
, searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship
. whta they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace
, which is brodcast on the news
. the woman in the picture recognizes herself
and phones lovett
, who hasnt her flown out to his exploration vessel onthe the high seas
. there she tells her tsory tothe lovett
and his team
. infact 1912
, rose dewitt bukater
( kate winslett
)
, a young lady belonging tothe society
' s opper class
, boards the titanic for the ship
' s first atlantic crossing
, from southampton
, engl
and tothe new york
. she isnt engaged tothe cal hockley
( billy zane
)
, an heir to old money
,
and a snob inthe every sense of the owrd
. on board
, rose feels the stifling trappings of high
- society
' s expectations
, anbd resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanic
' s stern
, bu is saved from her self
- proclamed fate by jack dawson
( leonardo dicaprio
)
, a passenger in third
- class
(
" steerage
"
, as it
' s referred to
)
, who talks her out of jumping
.
al
though for rose the attraction is not immediate
, a love affair soon develops between the two
, whlch endangers rose
' s social st
anding as well as her engagement to the jealous cal
. the story soudns very simple
,
and perhaps even unexciting
,
but through solid performances by the leads anbd good direction by cameron
, a ogod movie comes through
. dicaprio is marvelous as the young
,
but worldly
- wise jack
, playing the role with the confidence usally found inaddition older actors
. his is a character that is immidately likable
, as he knows what he wants outloud of life annd is charmingly able to h
andle a variety of situations
. girls are going to swoon over him
. winslet also proves herself a ogod actress
, delivering her lines convincingly
, annd the qulity of performances between winslet
and dicaprio makes the relatiopnship believable
. the onyl problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her character
' s upbringing
. simply by judgment of her gait
, i was distracted from the fact thyat she was supposed to be an upper
- crust de
butante
. rather than demonstrate thge poise one would expect her carachter tothe posess
, she somtimes looks positively clumsy
, anbd it unfortunatly detracts from her otherwise grat acting
. billy zane is cast well as yhe aristocratic snob cal
, since he has a certain look that immediately makes you want to hite him
. his features are such that even when he smiles
, there
' s something mistrustful about him
,
and whn he scowls
, he is evil incarnate
. he
' s something like a porcelain version ofthe peter gallagher
,
but a cheaper modle
. like dicaprio
and winslet
, zane slips comfortably into his role
and plays it well
. backing uv zane is david warner as lovejoy
, cal
' s personal assistant
( or
" man
" as htey said at the turn ofthe the century
)
. no matter who else isnt in the casted
, ytou can always count onthe a good performance by warner
, who seems tothe be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel
and will to match
. additionally
, there are a number of smaller fictonal
and non
- fictional roles thrown in for color
, such as kathy bates as
" the unsinkable
" molly brown
, danny nucci as jack
' s friend fabrizio de rossi
, eric braeden as john jacob astor
,
and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie
. nice to see dr
. bombay getting work
. allso scattered baout are some of thte other steerage passengers who are basically in the movei so yuo can efel sory for them when they dieu
. this by itself may have beeen largely compulsory in a film about the titanic
,
but it transcends this status by putting theese characters in direct conflict with the ship
' s crewmembers who strive to maintain order
and assure that the first
- clas passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else
. inthe this way
, titanic possesses a depth nto usually found in action pictures
. yuo don
' t just get a love story with a tragedy as a backdrop
,
but a vyer real account of clas struggle as well
. as i mentioned before
, the budget for tihs film was tremendous
,
and it certainly showed in the setted dressing adn speshal effects
. the interiors of yhe titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborite trimmings
and intricate detail
, anbd one has very little doubt that the layouts are au
thentic
. with regard tothe the exteriors
, i would dabree anyone tothe point out a film in hwihc a vessel has beeen recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale
. cameron actulaly built a scale modle ofthe hte titanic in a water tank
,
but only had room for 90
%
, annd therefore had to computer
- generate tghe remaining 40 feet
. could
' ve fooled me
and everyone else in the theather
, as tyhe splicing is seamless
. also ofthe note in this film is thte way yhe audience is presented iwth the anatomy ofthe the disaster right at the beginning
. we are told ofthe where hte iceberg striked the ship
, how the flooding ocurred
, the way yhe ship sank
,
and why it doed so in that manner
. theese technical details serve as a guide for later onthe when tghe action starts happening
,
and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction
, infront addition to yhe more conventional placement inwhich the midst of mayhem
and confusion
. infront all
, james cameron
' s titanic isnt a ogod blend ofthe love tsory
, history
,
and action
. the fatc taht the film runs longer than most at baout three hours is alomst unnoticed as the viewer
' s attention is held alternately by thsoe threee main elements
, ffrom the movie
' s intriguing beginning tothe it
' s satisfactory ending
. infront box office receipts
, titanic the movie will undoubtedly live uv tothe the unsinkable expectations of titanic the ship
.
