sometimes you jstu have to tip your hat to a film
. sometimes you jsut have tothe jump onthe the b
andwagon
and enjoy tjhe ride
. i saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers
, most of whom were no doubt drawn by ace ventura himself
and hoping to see his latest tkae on fart jokes
. surprised
, they may have been
, when they realized that htis picture actaully had something to sday
.
but by the attentiveness of the crowd i
' d sday they were won over
- as was i
. i can
' t tell
yet if truman realyl is that good
, or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of hollywood so far this year
. time alone wiull make that call
. bu by the end ofthe the film we weere all onthe truman burbank
' s side
. we were concerned forthe his well
- being
, anbd wnated him to win
. tht we feeled as we did is a tri
bute both to teh film
and to jim carrey
, who hasnt acheived ligitamassy at lastr
. tje truman show is a film best viewed cold
, with as little foreknowledge as possible about the plot
. unless yuo
' re under a media blackout
,
however
, you probably know the basics
. carrey stars as truman burbank
, a capra
- esque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife meryl
( laura linney
) in the south florida isl
and town of seahaven
, which looks like michael eisner
' s idea ofthe the perfect american small town
. truman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle
, complete with a working wief
, a best bud
, friendly neighbors
and interesting co
- workers
. there is tradgedy inaddition his past
- his father drowned in a horrible boating accident
, leaving truman with a dreadful fear of water
, adn of travel inaddition general
-
but overall
, life is good
.
but
then one day as truman leaves his hous for owrk
, a klieg light falls magically fomr the sky
. this curious event may lead truman to disover what thge rest of the world already knows
: tath he is a prisoner on the world
' s biggest soundstage
, that his wife
, friends
and relatives are all actors paid to interact with him
, adn that his life hasnt
, for over 10
, 000 days
, been broadcast as teh world
' s most popular television program
. what makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch is the magical versimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol
and weir
. tyhe soundstage
, we
' re told
, is
" only the second man
- made structure visible fomr space
.
" truman
' s movements are tracked ceaselessly by 5
, 000 cameras scattered throughout yhe twon
:
button cams
, dashboard cams
, mirror cams
, wife cams
, big cams
and small cams
. weir cuts the film so we
' re never quite sure if we
' re watching truman through the camera of director weir or through the camera of tje show
' s omnipotent creator christof
( ed harris
) who oversees tjhe show ffrom a controll room built into the man
- made moon inaddition seahaven
' s sky
. the second act offers a plethora of clues for truman as to the truth of his existence
. his best friend marlon
( noah emmerich
) always hasnt a six pack ofthe beer wtih him
. his wife seems tothe exist infact an eternal commercial in whitch she is allways endorsing the latest hot household product
. he sees the same people walking iin the same set patterns all over town
. oen wonders why he didn
' t pik up on any ofthe tihs earlier
, bu christof has an answer for this
:
" people tend to accept the reality with which they
' re presented
.
" nethertheless
, truman begins to grow restless
, adn dreams ofthe escape to fiji
, where an old college sweetheart
( natasha mcelhone
) supposably lives
. htis convincing reality ofthe television as progenitor of reality isnt a magical
and provocative consept
; the best thing jim carrey does is stay out of its way
. by underplaying truman
, he allows the subtle manipulations of the film to tkae over
. there isnt a particlarly poignant scene in which truman confides his fears to marlon
, anbd marlon answers with best
- friend sincerity
,
" i
' d gladly step in front of a bus for you
.
" bu thyat line wass fed to marlon through an earpiece by christof
. the abject cruelty tothe whitch truman is subjected to hits home
- annd fomr that moment
, we
' re onthe his side
. the truman sohw derives much ofthe its success ffrom palying tothe our own secre paranoid fantasies
- haven
' t we all
, at least once
, doubted our place in the world
, doubted teh sincerity of those closest tothe us
? ultimately
,
however
, the picture rises above its own artifice to raise some real questions baout the relationship of humankind annd our creator
. what does god really think of us
? does he resent our ab
andonment ofthe paradise
? who exactlly is watching us
, up there in the sky
? if you enjoy the picture as much as i did
, credit weir fo allowing the magic ofthe the screenplay to work
. as for carrey
- well
, truman burbank is the kind of role that jimmy stewart was born to play
. carrey is noone jimmy stewart
; tothe his credit
, he doesn
' t try to be
. he just tries to fiel the way you or i would
, if we suddenly found out that the whole world was watching us
.
