: very good seats
, soudn
and picture
] do ytou realize that every time you encounter a new person you ' ve just become part of a story
? everyone has their pwn life sotry
, both past
and present
,
anbd every time two or moreso interact
, they become part of each others ' story
( not necessarily an important or even significant part
,
but a part nevertheless
)
. that seems to be the basic theory behind
` go
, ' where several characters ' chance encounters all effect eahc other inaddition extreme ways
. in order to tust thsi theory screenwriter john augost
and directer doug liman assemple a cast of cahracters tht wouldn ' t usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them
, such as a teenage supermarket cashier
, a bottom
- of
- hte
- drug
- food
- chain dealer
and twpo stuggling soap opera actors
. these types of characters might not sound all tyhat original
,
bu consider that htey will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer
and his psychotic father
, a mid
- level drug dealer
, a narc obsessed with multi
- level
- marketting
, horny wedding guests
, a zen lovemaker
, two shrimp
- scarfers
and a cute normal teenage girl to round thigsn out
. how tehy will all come together isnt yhe process the film deals with
. i ' d imagin the concept to the film started outloud as the creators ' testing themselfs to see if they could ctually pull it off
anbd tyhe outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking
and the craft of fiction in general
. the film starts out as anything alse
, with little indication of what ' s to come
. we meet ronna
( polley
)
, a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn ' t seem to ahve much desire tothe do anything except work jstu tothe pay her rent
. she ' s nto very charming
, especially tothe her customers
,
but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization
adn it works
. maybe this is because she ' s not a veyr afeminite character
,
bu she ' s far from masculine
- a creative character indeed
. thigns start tothe progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take tjhe hours ofthe the goofy
, hyperactive
,
yet likable simon
( askew
)
, an english teen inot vices for the sake of tje experiences
. this agreement starts a three
- pronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for yhe weekend with his firends
and infact turn drags ronna
and her friends into buying
and selling an experimental drug
. the proces of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested
but also to death
. nearly the same can be said for twpo other characters
, zack
( mohr
)
and adam
( wolf
)
, who we don ' t tihkn much of when tehy first appear as supporting characters
,
but later will become major players to the film ' s makeup
- another process used by thge filmmakers to elaborate onthe the theery of how significant insignificant interaction might be
. once the pace is picked up thte film really beggins to show its mettle
. when the title screen
` ronna ' is flashed shorly affter tyhe aforementioned turning point scene
, it ' s clear thsi film isn ' t going to employ the standard linear method ofthe storytelling
. considering how good it is uv until that point
, it ' s a long overdue change ofthe pace needed in movies today
.
and so the film begins to take shape
, first by follwoing ronna
and her friends onthe a noe
- night adventure that begins witht a drug deal instigated by zack
and adam
( who were atually looking for simon
)
, which doesn ' t exactlly go as planned
,
but that ' s waht keesh it all so interesting
. the second storyline starts at the same moment as ronna ' s story
,
bu tihs time tje camera choosed to follow simon instead
. simon
anbd his threee firends head tothe
? vegas fo a nihgt on the town
and in tjhe process experience things tehy never would have imagined
. hte thrid arc
, about zack
and adam
, agina overlaps with ronna ' s story telling much of the same tsory
bu from a completely different angle
. we ' re shown thigsn we never would have expected were gonig on while following ronna
.
and many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack
anbd adam aren ' t even their fault
- they just happened tothe be where they were wehn tehy were
. i ' d really like tothe dissect eahc ofthe hte three storylines
annd especially how thte film wraps up inthe thte end
,
but that would take up too much time
and space
and spoil everything fo those who haven ' t seen the film
. perhaps tyhe greatest element to the film is its constant surprises
and unpredictability
,
and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay
, jsut through great filmmaking
. still
, i can list
and analyze nearly everything the film does so well
:
? direction
: trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task
anbd forthe a rookie filmmaker such as liman
, it ' s a great accomplishment
. he doesn ' t just depict a story
, he wraps us up in it all
, pulling us into the fray so that we experience every high
and low
.
? screenplay
: besides being chiseled with detail
and creative in general
, it ' s clear the script has been inspired by many sources
, wiht both obvious
and subtle references
,
yet it never screams
` rip
- off
. '
? tone
/ mood
: where other hollywood films ahve failed to bring the charm ofthe the independents to the mainstream
, this one is able to create its own sense of the macabre
. it ' s not overly
- dark or twisted
and the comedy isn ' t so satirical for it to be considered a black comedy
, more like
` macabre light
. '
? cinematography
/ art direction
: able to photograph both tyhe intense
anbd the lighthearted in the smae manner
.
? characterization
: fo nearly every character introduced
, no matter wqat role they play in the big picture
, we ' re able to get a sense of who tehy are
, what they ' re thinking
and how htey came tothe be inwhich theri situations
. even when theri actions are suprising
, it never seems vyre out of synch
.
? performances
: every actor nails their role
( see above
)
.
? theme
/ theery
: tyhe film doesn ' t seem tothe be concerned with conveying any kind of political or social messages
, instead
, it ' s more of a philosophical experiment
. in fact
, it might nto have meant to dont thgat intentionally
,
but there definitely isnt something existential to it all
.
.
.
.
and to think thgat
` go ' is just a big comedy
anbd adventure
