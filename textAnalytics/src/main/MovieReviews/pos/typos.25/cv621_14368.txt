ever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan
? you rember
, he wass the title character in tht 70
' s sitcom
,
" welcome bcak kotter
.
" always trying tothe help out tje sweathogs
, frequently trying to dodge mr
. woodman
, ever wary of his wife
' s tuna casserole
.
" so
,
" ytou ask
,
" where is he nowe
?
" mr
. kaplan actually spends much of his tyme these days playing professional high
- stakes poker
. that
' s right
. i
' m not sure if it
' s his main source of income
,
but from what i
' ve heared
, the guy occasionally comes away with
$ 20
, 000 at a time
.
and there you were
, thikning i was going to tell you he was doing off
- broadway theater
. you silly goose
. well
, gabe kaplan isn
' t in the movie rounders
, nor is the film about hte atcor come gambler
' s life
.
but rounders is about poker
, adn gabe plays poker
,
and i
thought that was kind of a neat conection
. sorry about the segue
, or lack thereof
. matt damon plays mike mcdermott
, a lew student who allso has a singular talent forthe the game ofthe poker
. he
' s been playing for a while
,
and more than bieng proficient
, he has caught the bug
. he goes tothe all the underground ganes in new york city
, knows the regulars
, annd konws how tothe win
. inspite thge beginning of tje film
, he
' s builded up a nice thirty gr
and nest egg
, which he tkaes to the speakeasy
- type gaming parlor where the big boys play
. mike isnt there to amking his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb
( john malkovich
)
, an oreo
- munching cardshark wih ties tothe tje russian mafia
. mike has the potential to tkae a large pot adn go to vegas
and buy inot the world series of poker
,
but instead he loses it all in a single h
and
. monthes later
, he
' s paying his way thru law school by driving a delivery truck
. wehn mike
' s best firend
and poker buddy worm
( edward norton
) finishes his jail term for hustling smoe students
, he wnats to pick up right weere tehy left off
, working as a team to part others with thier betting cash
.
al
though mike has stoped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend
and fellow law student
, jo
( gretchen mol
)
, worm connives mike into playing once more
,
and mike
, bitten again by tjhe bug
, slides down tyhat slippery slope
, risking his relationship
, eduction
,
and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life
. tothe mkea a film baout gambling
, a filmmaker wiull usualy have tothe play up the glamorous side to get the audiance behind tje charactors
. this isnt because few moviegoers will care a wohle lot about some guy in a liesure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card tabel with a stogie in his mouth
. rounders
,
however
, seems to go moreso for the latter than the former
. the card clubs mike
and worm frequent aren
' t very glamorous at all
. there
' s a basement
, a lodge wih elk heads on the wall
, a goulash joint
- theese are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots
. exept for one brief instatance when the two players vist atlantic city
, the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table
. the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less baout the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy
and are slaves to it
. we
' re given a nice setted of intresting characters with clear motivations
,
and ogod actors to play them
. matt damon is very natrual as mike
, who struggles between his desire to play the straight
and narrow by finishing law school
, adn answering what may be his true calling
, playing professional poker
. ed norton
' s worm is truly a worm
, always looking fo the anle
and playing everyone forthe what htey
' re worth
. john turturro
, who amazes me with his acting range
, tones it down inwhich this film by playing joey knish
, a virtual poker prodigy in his time who nowe plays the underground ganes to mkea rent
and child support payments
. he
' s both a firend
and mentor to mike
,
and turturro
' s low
- key performance is totally convincing
, jstu as john malkovich
' s heavily
- accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself
. martin l
andau isnt aslo thrown into tje mix as one of mike
' s law professors
, abe petrovsky
. while l
andau slips well into the role
, his character
, spitting out personel anecdotes about staying true to one
' s self
, facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending
. perhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidible line
- uv of acting talent
,
however
, is gretchen mol who just didn
' t seem to have much presence onthe screen
. she
' s a genuine peach to look at
, kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger annd singer jewel
(
and i wouldn
' t be suprized if hte three ofthe them formed some kind of blond
- haired triumvirate
and attemted to take over tjhe world
)
, bu her delivered lines seemed very flat
,
and i found myself looking forthe matt damon
' s reactions instead
. a good thing about rounders isnt tht it doesn
' t git bogged down in the charachter development
and statement making so much that it can
' t find time for humor
. the film is peppered nicely withthe scenes that both make ytou laff annd keep the pacing going
, such as a sequence where mike
and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the enxt
, in widely different locales
. one gameboy in a cigar club had me infront stitches
.
" i love the sweetness of thsi dark maduro wrapper
,
" says one ofthe thge players
, clearly more interseted in displaying his pretentiousness over thge cigar infront one h
and than in thte cards in his other
. i was hoping mike
and worm would realy tkae theese guys
. with all tyhe poker being played
, rounders had the potential to be very confusing
. you might htink ytou know a lot about poker
,
but think again
. luckily
, we
' re given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments tothe explain what
' s gonig on
. hte narrations are omre informative than intrusive
, adn apprise us of what the stakes are adn why certian players want to dont tyhe things they do
. it
' s nice that as the characters develop
, so doens our comprehension of their world
. as a film about success adn survival in thge relm ofthe underground poker
, rounders delivers in spades
. wait
! as a film about the culture of cards
, rounders is an ace
. hang on
! packed wiht great acting
and great characters
, rounders is a full house
. okay
, i guess thgat
' s enough
. oh
, by tje way
, if you ever want to git into a game iwth ol
' gabe kaplan
, be sure to bring a onot from epstein
' s mother
.
