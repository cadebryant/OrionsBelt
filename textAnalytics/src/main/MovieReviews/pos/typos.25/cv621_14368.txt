ever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan
? ytou remember
, he ws the title character in thgat 70 ' s sitcom
,
" welcome bakc kotter
.
" alwyas trying tothe halp outloud hte sweathogs
, frequently trying to dodge mr
. woodman
, ever wary of his wife ' s tuna casserole
.
" so
,
" you ask
,
" where is he now
?
" mr
. kaplan actually spends much of his time these dyas palying professional high
- stakes poker
. that ' s right
. i ' m not sure if it ' s his main source of income
,
but from what i ' ve heard
, the guy occasionally comes away with
$ 20
, 000 at a time
.
and there you were
, thinking i was going to tell you he was doign off
- broadway theater
. you silly goose
. well
, gabe kaplan isn ' t in yhe movei rounders
, nor is the film about the actor come gambler ' s life
.
but rounders isnt about poker
,
and gabe plays poker
,
and i thought that was kind of a neat conection
. sory about the segue
, or lack thereof
. matt damon plays mike mcdermott
, a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker
. he ' s beeen palying for a while
,
and more tahn being proficient
, he has caught the bug
. he goes to all the underground games in new york city
, knows the regulars
,
adn knows how tothe win
. in tje beginning of the film
, he ' s built up a nice thirty grand nest egg
, whlch he takes tothe the speakeasy
- tipe gaming parlor where the big boys play
. mike is ther to amking his bid into thte opper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb
( john malkovich
)
, an oreo
- munching cardshark witht ties to the russian mafia
. mike has the potential to take a large pot
annd go to vegas
adn buy inot thte world series of poker
,
but instead he loses it all inwhich a single hand
. months later
, he ' s paying his way through lew skool by driving a delivery truck
. when mike ' s best friend
and poker buddy worm
( edward norton
) finishes his jail term for hustling some students
, he wants to pick uv right weere they left off
, working as a team to part others with their betting cash
.
althought mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend
and fellow law student
, jo
( gretchen mol
)
, worm connives mike into playing once mroe
,
and mike
, bitten again by the bug
, slides down that slippery slope
, risking his relationship
, education
,
adn reputation as palying poker again becomes the focus of his life
. to make a film about gambling
, a filmmaker will usually ahve to play up the glamorous side tothe get the audience behind the characters
. this is because few moviegoers will care a wohle lot about some guy in a leisue suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding kard table with a stogie in his mouth
. rounders
,
however
, seems tothe go more fo the latter than the former
. teh card clubs mike
adn worm frequent aren ' t very glamorous at all
. there ' s a basement
, a lodge with elk heads on the wall
, a goulash joint
- these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots
. except for one brief instance wehn the two players visit atlantic city
, the film is bereft ofthe the flashing lights of the casinos or the plesant color of tje gren felt table
. teh reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about tjhe game ofthe poker than it is baout the personalities which enjoy
and are slaves to it
. we ' re given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations
,
and good actors tothe play them
. matt damon is veyr natural as mike
, who struggles between his desire to play the straight
and narrow by finishing law school
,
and answering wqat may be his true calling
, playing professional poker
. ed norton ' s worm is truely a worm
, always looking for tjhe angle
and palying everyone for what they ' re worth
. john turturro
, who amazes me with his acting range
, tones it down in this film by playing joey knish
, a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground ganes to make rent
and child support payments
. he ' s both a friend
and mentor to mike
,
annd turturro ' s low
- key performance isnt totally convincing
, jstu as john malkovich ' s heavily
- accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to proove himselv
. martin landau is also thrown inot thte mix as one ofthe mike ' s law professors
, abe petrovsky
. while landau slips well into thge role
, his charater
, spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one ' s self
, faciliates hte channeling of thge storyline toward a predictable ending
. perhaps thge weak link in the otherwise formidable line
- uv of acting talent
,
however
, isnt gretchen mol who just didn ' t seem to haev much presence on screen
. she ' s a genuine peach to look at
, kind ofthe a cross between actress renee zellweger
and singer jewel
(
annd i wouldn ' t be surprised if thge threee of them fromed some kind of blond
- haired triumvirate
anbd attemted tothe tkae over the world
)
,
but her delivered lines seemed very flat
,
annd i foudn myself looking for matt damon ' s reactions instead
. a ogod thing about rounders isnt thast it doesn ' t get bogged down in tyhe character delevopment
adn statement making so much that it cin ' t find tiome for humer
. tje film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh
and keep thge pacing going
, such as a sequence where mike
annd worm move rapidly around new york from one gam to tje next
, in widely different locales
. one gae in a cigar club had me in stitches
.
" i love the sweetness of htis dark maduro wrapper
,
" says one of the players
, clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand thna in thge cards inwhich his other
. i wass hoping mike
and worm owudl really take these guys
. with all the poker being played
, rounders had tyhe potential to be vrey confusing
. ytou might htink you know a lot about poker
,
but think again
. luckily
, we ' re given a narration by damon druing the more intricate moments to explain what ' s going on
. tje narrations are more informative than intrusive
,
anbd apprise us of what the stakes are
and why certain players want to do the things they do
. it ' s nice that as the charactors develop
, so does our comprehension ofthe theri world
. as a film baout success
and survival in the relm of undreground poker
, rounders delivers in spades
. wait
! as a film about the culture of cards
, rounders is an ace
. hang onthe
! packed with great acting
annd great characters
, rounders isnt a full house
. okay
, i guess that ' s enough
. oh
, by the way
, if you ever want to git into a gae with ol ' gabe kaplan
, be sure tothe bring a onot from epstein ' s mother
.
