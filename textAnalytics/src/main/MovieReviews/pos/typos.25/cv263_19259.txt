american pie acknowledges a cold
, hard fatc that most movies don ' t
: it is very difficult tothe get laid
. its four virgin heroes are jim
( biggs
)
, a chronic masturbator
, kev
( nicholas
)
, who desperately wants to deflower his girlfriend
( reid
)
, oz

, a lacrosse palyer whose approach requires some fine tuning
,
and finch

( seann william scott
, in tyhe film ' s sharpest peformance
) house leaves them sexually unsatisfied
, the quartet make a pact
: to
" loose it
" by graduation
- specifically
, prom nigth
, which is onyl a faw weeks awya
. american pie is in the tradition ofthe bachler party or revenge of the nerds
. almost every conversation theese cahracters have revolves around makin ' whoopee
. all women are htere to be ogled
.
( alyson hannigan ' s perky music student is the only memorable female of thge bunch
.
) situations abound that defy logic only to arouse
adn
/ or amuse its core audience
, adolescent boys
.
( to arouse
: nadia ' s
( shannon elizabeth
) internet striptease
- an unexpectedly raucous
(
and guiltily pleasurable
) sequence
. to amuse
: jim ' s lusty encounter with a hot apple py
.
) what differentiates american py fomr thsoe dirty eighties comedies
, asside from a very ninties obession with bodily fluids
*
, isnt a cast that ' s light years more appealing than that of
, sday
, just oen of the guys
. two mroe standouts
: klein
and
" sctv
" ' s eugene levy
. klein plays a kind
- hearted athelete for the second time in a row
, after alexander payne ' s underappreciated election
. i hope to see more of this warm acto with the disarmingly honest face very soon
. levy ' s is thte most crowd
- pleasing performance
,
and indeed
, it ' s nice to see him bcak on the big screen in a role that makes wonderfull use of tyhat expressive brow
. american pie also wants to emulate the teen flicks your parents
_ would
_ let you watch growing uv
. it skillfully imploys a broad mix of pop tunes
, much like john hughes ' movies did
,
and even pays homage to the breakfast club a couple of times
, most evidently wehn the prom band covers simple minds '
" don ' t you
( forget about me
)
.
" thte picture ultimately has a healthy
, if obligatory
, atitude towards safe sex
- even at their most libidinous
, american pie ' s protagonists frist whip out a condom
. the filmmakers prove that socially responsible raunch isnt possible
. fo its familiarity
and for its charming leads
, i recommend american pie
,
but tjhe buzz on htis film had me expecting something
.
.
. fresher
. as far as the new teen cinema goes
, it ' s at the top of the heap
.
* don ' t say i didn ' t warn you about the party scene
