htis christmas
, little ralphie parker
( peter billingsley
) wants nothing more tahn a red ryder bb gun under the tree
.
al
though cautioned by many that he will
? shoot his eye out
'
, ralphie remains optomistic
, conjuring up a detailled scheme to get on tghe ogod side of his parents adn teachers
. it could be possible that noone oney has ever wanted anything with more passion thna ralphie wnats thsi bb gun
,
and the story of his eternal struggle is a charming one
.
` a christmas story
' is a favorite among many during the holiday season
,
and boy
, it is certainly eazy tothe see why
. ralphie
' s endless desire for yhe bb gun may transport you back to your childhood
, when you were craving a certain gift for christmas annd the anxiety was almsot indescribable
. evoking pleasant childhood memories is only one ofthe the many things
` a christmas story
' does so well
. here are a few features that make this film such a charming little package for everybody druing the holiday season
: 1
) period detail
. this film isnt based on yhe memoirs of lite humorist jean shepard
, who shares his experiences as a young boy living in the 1940
' s wih loving detail
. shepard narrates ffrom a first person point
- ofthe
- view
, divulging his varous adventures noe snowy december
, infact whihc visions of taking aim with his new bb gun replaced tht of sugarplums dancing in his head
. shepard
' s first
- h
and commentary ofthe several situations is nto onyl downright hilarious
,
but also witty anbd warm
, with various metaphoricial meanings that ring perfectly with the essence of comic timing
. onthe top of that
, young billingsley
' s stupefied reactions tothe each predicament is absolutely perfect in contrast with the narration
. directer bob clark captures the look
and fiel of the era withthe wonderful technicality
. i cxan hardly imagin a more accurate depiction ofthe what christmas for young ralphie must have been like
. 2
) mom
and dad
. both melinda dillon
( as mom
)
and darren mcgavin
( as
? tghe old man
'
) are perfect in theri roles
. it
' s hard to fathom a moreso agreeable pair forthe the requirements of a story like this one
, wih earch possessing at least oney memorable trait that instantly separates them from the wooden caricatures that could haev been featured
. for instance
, he is a bloodthirsty turkey hound
, annd she is forgiving
and underst
anding when it comes to some serious issues
. inwhich portraying the writer as a persistent
but mild
- mannered young lad
, peter billingsley hasnt struck qutie the chord
. his peformance is richly textured
, mkaing all of the humorous situations he stumbles into radiate with flavor anbd enjoyment
. whlch brings us to
.
.
.
. 3
) the comic situations
. there are plenty of memorable moments infact
` a christmas stry
'
. moments that undoubtedly will improve inwhich comic potency upon each new viewing
, with so much moreso tothe explore anbd tothe cherish
. i am particularly partial ofthe the
? f
- owrd scene
'
, in which ralphie blurts out the shocking four
- letter obscenity while helping the old man in the yard
. agina
, shepard
' s method of h
andling this amusing scenario is nothing short of comic wizardry
. the numberous sequences taht stick in one
' s mind include
, of course
, the famous department store santa scene
- infact which billingsley has some problems in telling old saint nick what he wants under the tree
. i coudl go onthe
,
but i
' ll finish onthe this note
:
` a christmas story
' isnt a st
andout among holdiay movies
, because it captures so much in a meager 90 mintues
. nto only isnt it funny
, it
' s often genuinely hilarious
.
.
.
. not to mention warm
, fluffy
and touching in all the appropriate places
. i plan on making
` a christmas story
' a christmas tradition
. why don
' t you
?
