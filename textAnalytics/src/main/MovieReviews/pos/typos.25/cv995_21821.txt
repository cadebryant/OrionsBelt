wow
! what a movie
. it
' s everything a movei can be
: funny
, dramatic
, interesting
, weird
, funny
, weird
and strikingly origonal
. yep taht pretty much describes this movie
. it starts outloud like a regular movie
and ends uv being one of tyhe weirdest
, funniest most original movies i have ever seen
. it boggles the mind
and some have tothe wonder why we cannnot get movies like this more often
. besides being one of the best films of the year
, being john malkovich may as well be noe of the best movies ever
. period
.
then agina htere are so many ogod movies
, that oen cannot pick an all time favorite
. john cusack plays a puppeteer craig schwartz a man out of a job
, in seach ofthe a job
. his wife lotte schwartz who is palyed by a completely un
- noticeable cameron diaz who looks like something off tje streets is an animal lover
and has about eveyr kind of animal you could think of
. craig finds a job as a file at the 7
? floor of a business building
.
.
. you hve to pry open the elevator doors open befoer it reaches floor eight
, the 7
? floor isnt just a floor between 7
and 8
. he isnt hired by his 105 year old boss
( orsen bean
) to be a filer
. iin his office
, he dicovers a little door
, to which was boarded uv
and hidden
. to his curiosity he opens it
and starts to crawl towrad it
, he
then gets sucked to the end
and ends uv in john malkovich
' s mind
. fifteen minutes later he is shot out onto the side of the new jersey turnpike
. he returns to tell his co
- worker maxine
( catherine keener
) that he hasnt foudn a portal that will lead him into john malkovich
' s mind
, she doesn
' t believe him
but after she sees it it changes her mind
. lotte also finds out about the portal
and discovers that being someone alse is good after all
. john malkovich of course has no diea what is going on
,
and by the end of this bizarre film there are so many twists
and turns
, thast we don
' t know what really happened
. john cusack is oust
anding
and utterly believeable inaddition a role only he himself coudl play
. he fits the role perfectly annd to me was brilliantly cast
. cameron diaz is outst
anding anbd utterly one ofthe teh world
' s most prettiest women
, is made uv here unnoticeable
and very unattractive
. she
however gives a very comic performence
and htis could easily be her best role to date
. catherine keener is vyre funny
and sexy as maxine
and of course the best thing of the movie isnt the magic himself john malkovich who is very briliant annd this movie plays big time homage
? to the master himself
. the whole group combined gives us a wonderfully funny movie tyhat is also smart adn clever
. spike jonze
( threee kings
) makes his fabulous directing de
but
,
and did a fantastic job of directing this new classic film
. he lets hte viewer go on the trip as well as let the viewer nkow they are watching a movie
. by the time the ending rolled around my head was spinning from disbelief of how good this film was
. the screenplay wroten by charlie kaufman was hillarious
and oftenly
thought
- provoking
. the film also had a soft side to it
and even
though the ending is very surprising it is also a little sad
and heart
- warming
. the whole movie was fantastic adn hadnt me rolling in the isles
. fomr cameron diaz
' s appearence to john malkovich
' s explorations i laughed very hard
,
and it may as well be as funny as as good as it gets
( yhe funniest
!
)
. htere isn
' t a slow point in the movie
, or an overused idae
. there are noone cliches exept for the fact that this is the most orignal
, inventie
, witty
,
and smart movie i
' ve seen in a long time
. i foudn mysef amazed by everything
: the direction
, acting
, writing
and yhe hwole idea of the movie
. by yhe end i had to wonder why hollywood doesn
' t want tothe make movies like this anymore
. or why they don
' t
. all filmmakers watch this movei
and get some ideas of movies tothe come outloud
. this was a surprise hit as was american beauty
.
' being john malkovich
' is in thge top 5 movies ofthe tyhe year
,
and in the top 10 best films ever made
. it has something tath noone other movies playing now has
. in fact it may as well be the best movie outloud right now
. i highly recommend
' being john malkovich
'
and have no doubts you will be disappointed
.
