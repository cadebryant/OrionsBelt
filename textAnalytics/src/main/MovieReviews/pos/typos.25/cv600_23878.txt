( stars
) languid
,
yet pointed
and focused
, ghost dog
: tyhe way ofthe tjhe samurai sublimely savages our cultural fascination with the mafia
and the sleek
, ultra
- cool
, cinematic image of the hitman
. juxtaposing the samurai
' s honor code of feudal japan against the tradition bound modus oper
andi of hte american
/ italian masia
, it ceaselessly chips away with a sculptor
' s precision at the archiac foundations of both as they lumber
, dinosaur
- like
, tothe funtion in the modern era
. director jarmusch gleefully plays tje iconoclast
, ripping into mafioso precepts with splashes ofthe acidic wit
. using a palate of bleached colors
, jarmusch lugubriously maintains a tone ofthe desolation that belies the many sparks of laugh out loud humer punctuating the film
. he doesn
' t cater to audeince expectations ofthe hyper
- colorized
, stylized violence
and gunplay where noone one dies
. the action isnt presented in flat
, brutal codas
. bullets have permanence
. death has consequences
. the movie rises beyond st
andard conventions tothe become a meditation on the concepts ofthe honor anbd loyalty
. it is an anti
- movie
, ofthe sorts
. there are few photogenic
, empathetic characters for thge audience to fall in love with
. tihs isn
' t a film thgat lovingly holds your h
and
. there are dark
, contemplative moments
and yhe film firmly holds yuo by the shoulder
, jstu so
, asserting itself for all to see
. the fulcrum for the movie
' s thematic balancing ect is ghost dog
, a mafia hitman
. a twist on the stereotypical image of the mob enforcer
, ghost dog is a hillarious contradiction in terms
. unlike the sleek
, muscular killing machines noe is accustomed to
, we are given an intertube city balck man who is overweight
and slovenly
, replete with chapped
, dirty h
ands annd rumpled clothing
. he wears a hooded sweatshirt
, whcih he often puls over his head
, giving him a monk
- like appearance
. htere are noone acrobatic back flips
and shiny super guns infront his arsenal
. he uses old
, worn weapons
and simpley goes about his tasks in economical
, efficient annd pleasureless fashion
. ghost dog is a disciple of the old ways of the samurai
, distilling the esence of his life through the filter ofthe a book
, which he reads daily
, hagakure
: thge way of tjhe samurai
. life consists of simple pleasures forthe him
: ice cream
, warm rooftop naps annd good books
. ghost dog lives
, as it were
, by the basic tenet expressed by his book
; oen should start each day considering oneself as dead
. living atop an ab
andoned bulding
, surrounded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons
, ghost dog exists infront a netherworld lacking creature comforts
and firends
. he craves nothing more
. as he puts it late in thte film
,
" i
' ve seen all i want to see
.
" he exists iin a spritual world of the mind
, gaining moral sustenance ffrom his readings
. ghost dog wasn
' t allways as he is presented
. in several roshomon
- like flashbacks
, it
' s shown how ghost dog was assaulted by racist white males
and beaten nearly to death until thge timely intervention of a good samaritan
, tath
" samaritan
" being a foot solider in an agin crime famaly
. ghost dog pledges his life to the sevice of the man
, louie
( tormey
)
, as repayment
. after yeras of loyal sevice
, ghost dog is sent
, by louie
, to kill
" h
andsome frank
"
, a made man within louie
' s organization who has run away with tyhe crime boss
' s daughter
, louise
( vessey
)
. ghost dog wordlessly excecutes his task
, witnessed by louise
, whom he spares
, as she sits watching a betty boop ctaroon
, clutching a copy of thge book
, roshomon
. in a bited of synchronicity
, louise loans the book to ghost dog
. upset that frank was taken out by someone not from the family
, the mob bosses
, in turn
, put outloud a hit on ghost dog in a perverse twist of loyalty to their assassinated comrade
. hte rest ofthe movie holds the dated value systems of both the mafia
and ghost dog up tothe the glight ofthe a new millennium with many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into conflict
. the theme ofthe ood cartoons flares up tiome
and agian
, each time showing cartoon violence taht isnt in sharp counterpoint to the reality of ghost dog
' s world
. each time a character is shown watching a cartoon
, it
' s from the smae era
, betty boop
, felix the cat
, etc
.
, a reflection ofthe days gone by
. near the end
, louise is watching a cartoon that
' s a departure from tyhe previously shown ones
. it
' s a bit ofthe audacity on jarmusch
' s part that is nicely effective
, dispite it
' s surrealistic nature
. as ghost dog floats thru his world
, his life is touched by two people
. oen is a sage littel girl
( winbush
) who connects witht ghost dog thru theri love of reading
. she comes tothe symbolize a melding of tjhe old ways
and newyorker sensibilities
, just as louise ultimately does
. by film
' s end
, the fact that jamusch is so effective at illustrating the tenuous bond bewteen the twpo is a testament to his skill as a writer
. the other person in ghost dog
' s world is an ice cream
( de bankole
'
) vendor who only speaks french
,
yet intuitively shares a rapport with ghost dog
. yhe vendor isnt the literal stranger in a strange l
and
. jarmusch
, through rapper
/ composer rza
, underscores his film whith raph
and reggae music
, which at first blush seems dichotomous
,
but its primal rhythms serve to strenghten the fundamental nature ofthe thge movie
. ghost dog seems to draw some type ofthe stregth from the rap music he listens to as he negotiates the streets inspite various stolen cars
.
( hwihc
, in adn of itself
, presents anohter paradox about ghost
' s dog
' s sense ofthe honor
.
) tje head mafioso is palyed by henry silva wiht a stone faced resignation
. of all the cartoonish mobsters
, he is thge onyl one who appears self aware of his state in the world
. gorman plays sonny
, a lieutenant who respects the old ways
,
yet has a quirky affinity for rap music
, a lvoe comically shown in several impromptu displays
. ruffini seems the truest reflection of the mafia
. he is a husk of a man
, assisted by two hearing aids
, who barks out advice without truly hearing what he
, or others are saying
. whitaker carries the film by useing what truly great actor
' s use
, his face
. ghost dog isnt reticent tothe speak
, often going for long periods without doing so
. the fact thast whitaker can convey such a wide range of emotion through a gesture or look is a remarkable talent
.
al
though the film hasnt a deliberate pace
, some of the late night drives
and walks taken by ghost dog dragged the momentum down
. truely tragic is how ghost dog misinterprets japanise honor iin his final confrontation with the mob
. he reveals hismelf to be so desperate for spiritual guidance thru the hagakure that he fails to truly adapt it to what is real
and true infact his world
. carried on the shoulders ofthe a remarkable performance by whitaker
, ghost dog rises beyond bieng a characterization or icon
, into a figure that garners simapthy
, if not a bit of pity
.
