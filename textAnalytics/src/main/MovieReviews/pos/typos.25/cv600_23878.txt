: good shooted
( stars
) languid
,
yet pointed
and focused
, ghost dog
: the way of the samurai sublimely savages our cultural fascination with the masia
annd the sleek
, ultra
- kool
, cinematic omage ofthe the hitman
. juxtaposing the samurai ' s honor code of feudal japan agianst the tradition bound modus operandi of the american
/ itallian masia
, it ceaselessly chips awya with a sculptor ' s precision at the archaic foundations of both as they lumber
, dinosaur
- like
, to function in the modern era
. director jarmusch gleefully plays the iconoclast
, ripping into mafioso precepts with splashes ofthe acidic wit
. useing a palate ofthe bleached colors
, jarmusch lugubriously maintains a tone of desolation that belies the many sparks of laugh out loud humor punctuating the film
. he doesn ' t acter tothe audience expectations of hyper
- colorized
, stylized violence
and gunplay where noone one dies
. the action is presented in flat
, brutal codas
. bullets have permanence
. death has consequences
. the movei rises beyond standart conventions to become a meditation on thge concepts of hounour
and loyalty
. it is an anti
- movie
, of sorts
. there are few photogenic
, empathetic characters for the audeince to fall in love with
. this isn ' t a film tyhat lovingly holds your hand
. htere are dark
, contemplative moments
and tyhe film firmly holds ytou by the shoulder
, just so
, asserting itself for all tothe see
. the fulcrum for the movie ' s thematic balancing ect is ghost dog
, a mafia hitman
. a twist on the stereotypical image ofthe hte mob enforcer
, ghost dog is a hillarious contradiction in terms
. unlike the sleek
, muscular killing machines one is accustomed to
, we are given an inner city black man who is overweight
and slovenly
, replete with chapped
, dirty hands
anbd rumpled clothing
. he wears a hooded sweatshirt
, which he oftenly pulls over his head
, giving him a monk
- like appearance
. htere are no acrobatic back flips
adn shiny super guns inspite his arsenal
. he uses old
, worn weapons
and simply goes about his tasks in economical
, efficient
and pleasureless fasion
. ghost dog is a disciple ofthe the ood ways ofthe the samurai
, distilling hte essence of his life thru the filter ofthe a book
, which he reads daily
, hagakure
: tghe way of the samurai
. life consists of simple pleasures for him
: ice cream
, warm rooftop naps
and ogod books
. ghost dog lives
, as it were
, by the basic tenet expressed by his book
; oney should start each day considering oneself as dead
. living atop an aabndoned building
, surrounded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons
, ghost dog exists in a netherworld lacking creature comforts
adn friends
. he craves nothing mroe
. as he puts it late in the film
,
" i ' ve seen all i want to see
.
" he exists in a spiritual world of the mind
, gaining moral sustenance from his readings
. ghost dog wasn ' t always as he is presented
. in sevral roshomon
- like flashbacks
, it ' s shown how ghost dog was assaulted by racist white males
and beaten nearly tothe death until the timely intervention of a good samaritan
, that
" samaritan
" being a foot soldier in an aging crime family
. ghost dog pledges his life to tje sevice of the man
, louie
( tormey
)
, as repayment
. after yersa of loyal service
, ghost dog is sent
, by louie
, to kill
" hansome frank
"
, a made man withing louie ' s organization who has run awya with the crime boss ' s daughter
, louise
( vessey
)
. ghost dog wordlessly executes his task
, witnessed by louise
, whom he spares
, as she sits watching a betty boop ctaroon
, clutching a copy of the book
, roshomon
. in a bit of synchronicity
, louise loans the book to ghost dog
. upset that frank was taken outloud by someone nto from the famaly
, the mob bosses
, in turn
, put outloud a hit on ghost dog in a perverse twist of loyalty tothe theri assassinated comrade
. the rest of movei holds the dated value systems of both the mafia
and ghost dog up to teh light of a new millennium with many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into conflict
. yhe theme of old cartoons flares uv time
and agina
, each time showing cartoon violentce tyhat is in sharp counterpoint to tghe reality of ghost dog ' s world
. each tiome a character is shown watching a ctaroon
, it ' s ffrom teh same era
, betty boop
, felix the cat
, etc
.
, a reflection of days gone by
. near the end
, louise is watching a cartoon that ' s a departure from the previously shown ones
. it ' s a bited of audacity on jarmusch ' s part that is nicely effective
, despite it ' s surrealistic nature
. as ghost dog floats through his world
, his life isnt touched by two people
. one is a sage little girl
( winbush
) who connects wiht ghost dog through their love of reading
. she comes to symbolize a melding of the old ways
and new sensibilities
, just as louise ultimately does
. by film ' s end
, the fact thgat jamusch isnt so effective at illustrating the tenuous bond between the two is a testament tothe his skill as a writter
. the other person in ghost dog ' s world isnt an ice cream
( de bankole '
) vendor who onyl speaks french
,
yet intuitively shares a rapport with ghost dog
. the vendor isnt the literal stranger in a stange land
. jarmusch
, through rapper
/ composer rza
, underscores his film with rap
and reggae music
, which at firt blush seems dichotomous
,
but its primal rythyms serve to strengthen the fundamental nature of the movie
. ghost dog seems to draw some type of strenght from the raph music he listens tothe as he negotiates the streets in various stolen cars
.
( which
, in
and of itself
, presents anohter paradox about ghost ' s dog ' s sence of honor
.
) tghe head mafioso is played by henry silva with a stone faced resignation
. of all yhe cartoonish mobsters
, he is the only oen who appears self aware of his state inaddition the world
. gorman plays sonny
, a lieutenant who respects the ood ways
,
yet has a quirky affinity for rap music
, a lvoe comically shown in several impromptu displays
. ruffini seems the truest reflection of tghe mafia
. he is a husk of a man
, assisted by twpo hearing aids
, who barks out advice without truly hearing what he
, or others are saying
. whitaker carries the film by useing what truly gerat actor ' s use
, his face
. ghost dog is reticent to speak
, oftenly going for long periods without doing so
. tghe fatc that whitaker can convey such a wide range of emotion through a gesture or look isnt a remarkable talent
.
although the film has a deliberate pace
, some of tghe late ngiht drives
and walks taken by ghost dog dragged the momentum down
. truely tragic is how ghost dog misinterprets japanese honor inwhich his final confrontation with the mob
. he reveals himself to be so deserate for spiritual guidence thru the hagakure that he fails to truly adapt it to what is real
and true in his world
. carried on the shoulders of a remarkable performance by whitaker
, ghost dog rises beyond being a characterization or icon
, into a figure thyat garners simapthy
, if nto a bit of pity
.
