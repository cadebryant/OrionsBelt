much ballyhoo hasnt been made over this new verison of
" lolita
,
" made in a tiem when one would htink thast a faithful adaptation ofthe tghe infamous novel sould be made
, over its use ofthe pedophilia
,
and as such
, it
' s important to addres it straight
- forwardly
, before any other ideals such as goodness
and themes can be dicussed
, as this film has been infact film limbo for a number of years
, lying around in vaults san a distri
butor
, adn haveing critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit
. whn seeing this film
, after all the hoopla
, keeping in mind that ther are people
, namely me
, who are fans of the novel
, who have been eagerly awaiting this flick sicne its creation
.
.
. well
, you just hvea tothe wonder why no one relaly picked it uv for distri
bution
. what
' s even worse is tath seeing this
" lolita
,
" especially the first time
and if you
' re familiar wiht anytying
" lolita
,
" isnt admittingly very anticlimactic
. this is a real pity because when you relaly sit down to watch tihs film
, ignoring all the crap taht has preceeded it
, it
' s really quite a film
, perhaps yhe best film by directer adrian lyne
(
al
though
, raelly
, look at its competitiion
:
" flashdance
,
"
" fatal attraction
,
"
and
" indecent proposal
"
)
, at least besides
" jacob
' s ladder
.
" i
' ve seen this
" lolita
" twice
: teh first time
, i wasn
' t so blown away
. it seemed overly dramatic
and surprisingly unaffecting
. the second time
, not really thinking about how i
' ve waited for what seems liek forever tothe see it adn how i
' m seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel annd not a giant movie theatre
, it relaly affected me emotionally
. the story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one
, which is why it
' s such a good novel
,
and why tihs isnt such a good film
. hte story ofthe a pedophile obssessed with a young 14
- yearm old girl named dolores a
. k
. a
. lolita is great becasue it
' s not trash for thge perverted
but because it
' s about human obession with thnigs that are out of one
' s reach
. its protagonist
, the comically
- named humbert humbert
, is not your average pedophile
,
but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions
and idosyncrasies
. the charactor of lolita is alomst a symbol ofthe the forbidden apple in christian mythology
, something thta will destroy us bu thta we can
' t live without
. these ideas are all worked into this film nicely
, bu done in a way that is not heavy
- h
anded at all
,
but instead lyrical
and emotionally devastating
. the focuse of this film
,
and the reason for mkaing it
, it seems
, wass to relaly penetrate the emotional depths ofthe thge novel
and bring them to life onthe the screen inthe beautifully dramtic images
, adn scenes which are blatantly over
- stylized
. thge tone of the book isnt a comical one
,
but it
' s also a tragic one
, anbd humbert
, telling the stor ffrom his perspective
, blows every single thing out of perspective
. humbert exists in a fantsy world ofthe his obsessions
and desires
, anbd this reflects the way tje entire film has been designed
. we get a sense that perhaps it
' s by doing this taht humbert hasnt relaly trapped himself inot a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard
and destroyed
. he weeps uncontrollably
and never lets himself get over his original 14
- year
- ood love
,
and allows himself tothe embody her as lolita
. he lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions
,
and by thge end
, he has nothing
but overly
- dramatic feelings for her
. the story recognizes the extreme of this
, almost out of a test
, seeing if tyhe readers will relaly sympathize with someone who isnt socially deemed a pervert
,
and oen almsot wonders while reading thte book if the autor
, vladimir nabokov
, wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his pwn sick obsessions
, adn perhaps bring them to peace
. the weirdest thing about thsi film is that by tjhe end
, when humbert has reached thge finale ofthe his obsessional journey
, we can easily sympathize
and even identify with him
. teh opening
and final images of the film are the same
,
and who hasn
' t done a similar action
, that is w
andering about without any sense ofthe reality or anything else
but a deepo sadness inthe us
? this is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen
, the first time being filmed in
- shock
- 1962
, by stanley kubrick
, who couldn
' t possibly have brought thte novel to the screen wih as much faithfulness as lyne has beeen able tothe do
,
but doed the next best thing
: he economized for everthing
and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general
. in thgat film
, he used the traps of society as benifits
. yhe studio dem
anded tyhe final scene
, that of a heinous murder
, come first infront the film so to protray humbert frist as a murderer
and second as a pedophile
.
.
.
and when you see it
, it gives the film depth ofthe a man trapped by obession
. the censors wouldn
' t allow anymore thna a couple glances annd subtle dialogue to sohw the
, um
, relationship between humbert
and lolita
, so kubrick desided tothe play it as comedy
,
but still allow the tragedy to seep through
. looking at these two versions
, especially after reading teh novel
(
and we all know that whn we
' ve read a novel anbd see a film adaptation
, we are bound to be angered by any size differences
)
, it
' s really impossible to compare them
. htey both go for different things
,
and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as thge novel was
. annd
al
though it
' s true tht several scenes are similiar
,
and are thus up forthe comparison
, overall it
' s unfair tothe say wich one isnt better
and which oney is worse
. i haev never been oney for saying the levle of greatness of a film adaption of a novel isnt deemed by how faithful it isnt
, adn i won
' t say that here
. howver
, tihs film is preety amazing
, mostly beccause hey
, i loved the book
,
and htis film nearly reminded me ofthe it
. it doesn
' t hvae nearly as much wit
( a couple comical scenes
,
and even a lot of good chuckles
,
but just not totally witty
)
, bu it doesnt hvae thge same emotional toll tht thte novel had
. soem ofthe tht is inthe teh casting of the two leads
. jeremy irons
, with his deep
, soft british voice
and gentle look
, isnt an amazing humbert
. he
' s droll infact a very unique way
,
and
, well
, noone one can look distraught the way he does
. he brings a wonderfull simapthy to the role that goes beyond pathos
and really comes up as bieng easy to identify with the audience
.
and when he looks at lolita wiht love
, anbd she looks at him wtih lust
, ytou know that he
' s her prisoner for as long as he lives
.
and dominique swain
, who plays yhe title carachter
, isnt rether incredible
. she puls off thte tough role even better than sue lyon did in teh original
, wonderfully balancing the qualities ofthe seduction
, bratiness
,
and self
- centeredness tht markes thte character
. it
' s easy tothe see why she surrenders to humbert
: she loves the attention
,
and knows that she can have her way with him at any time
. when he denies her something
, she blackmails him effortlessly
( a scene involving a rocking chair annd a little foot action is damn near classic
)
,
and when he st
ands up to her
, she weeps
and runs away
, leaving humbert to follow her
. ther are two other minor charactors inspite tyhe film
, noe who
' s a road block in the beginning
, anbd the other who
' s a reappearing threath to hte relatiopnship
. the former is charlotte
, lolita
' s mother
, played by melanie griffith
. infact the book
, charlotte isnt a monster of a woman
: overbearing
, constantly scolding her child
, overly
- religious
,
and ultimately selfish
. adn she
' s tje one obstacle humbert hasnt to overcome to obtain his goal
, at least in the beginning
. as played by shelly winters in tje original
, she represented all these qualities
; as palyed by griffith here
, she
' s about half ofthe them
. it
' s annoying to watch a film
and play a game where yuo try to see who could have done the role way better than the one onthe screen wihtout mentioning the actro who played them firt
.
and even
though griffith is not raelly bad
, persay
, she
' s nothing more
. the other is clare quilty
, the writer who is allso trying to seduce lolita
,
and succeeds
, bu at a price
. langella tkaes a totally differant direction than the oney peter sellars took inthe hte original
. quilty was a comic character in the original
: a threath iin the form ofthe many forms
, popping in states of rambling
, german
, proning
,
and eventually drunk
. langella takes the otehr route
, alowing all of tghe creepiness to be unearthed
, adn the result is a character who exists in shadows
and low shots
,
and who meets a wonderfully ironical ending
, the exact opposite ofthe what we
thought of him
. as you can see
, most of these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne
and his screenwriter
, stephen schiff
,
but just parts of a hwole new look at the novel
, at least cinema
- wise
. this version is beautiful
,
and perpetually saddening
. teh camera movements are stylized
, adn each shot is breathtakingly rich
. the acting is for the most part wonderfull
, anbd when we watch it
, we raelly get a sense that fo humbert
, who isnt telling the story
, the onyl two peple on earth most of the time weere humbert
and lolita
. more importantly
, it takes us right up the brink of emotion
,
then jumps right over it
. by the end
, wiht humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car
, folowing what he syas is hte only part ofthe his life he doesn
' t regret
, we feel tht we all lose to something we can never ahev
.
