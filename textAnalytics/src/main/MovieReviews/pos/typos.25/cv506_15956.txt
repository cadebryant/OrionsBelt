much ballyhoo has beeen made over htis new verison of
" lolita
,
" made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made
, over its use of pedophilia
,
and as such
, it ' s imporatnt to addresable it straight
- forwardly
, before any otehr ideals such as goodness
and themes can be dicussed
, as this film hasnt been in film limbo fo a number of eyars
, lying around in vaults san a distributor
,
and having critics waiting to eather hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit
. whn seeing this film
, after all the hoopla
, keeping in mind that htere are people
, namely me
, who are fans of the novel
, who have beeen eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation
.
.
. well
, you just hve tothe wonder why no one realyl picked it up forthe distribution
. what ' s even worse isnt that seeing this
" lolita
,
" especially the first timne
annd if you ' re familliar with anything
" lolita
,
" is admittingly very anticlimactic
. this is a real pity because wehn you really sit down to watch this film
, ignoring all the crap that hasnt preceeded it
, it ' s really quite a film
, perhaps the best film by directer adrian lyne
(
although
, realy
, look at its competitiion
:
" flashdance
,
"
" fatal attraction
,
"
and
" indecent proposal
"
)
, at least besides
" jacob ' s ladder
.
" i ' ve seen tihs
" lolita
" twice
: tje first tyme
, i wasn ' t so blown away
. it seemed overly dramatic
and surprisingly unaffecting
. the second time
, not relaly thinking about how i ' ve waited for what seems like forever to see it
annd how i ' m seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel
and not a giant movie theatre
, it really affected me emotionally
. the story itself is a suprisingly heartbreaking noe
, whic isnt why it ' s such a good novel
,
and why thsi is such a ogod film
. thte story ofthe a pedophile obsessed wiht a young 14
- year old girl named dolores a
. k
. a
. lolita isnt great beacuse it ' s not trash for the perverted
but because it ' s baout human obession with things that are out of oney ' s triarch
. its protagonist
, yhe comically
- named humbert humbert
, isnt nto your average pedophile
,
but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions
and idosyncrasies
. the character of lolita isnt almost a symbol of the forebidden apple in christian mythology
, something thta will destroy us
but thast we cant ' t live without
. these ideas are all worked inot htis film nicely
,
bu done in a way that is not heavy
- handed at all
,
bu instead lyrical
annd emotionally devestating
. the focus ofthe this film
,
anbd the reason for mkaing it
, it seems
, wass tothe really penetrate the emotional depths ofthe the novel
and bring them to life on the screen infact beautifully dramatic images
,
and scenes which are blatantly over
- stylized
. thte tone of the book isnt a comical one
,
but it ' s also a tragic one
,
and humbert
, telling the story from his perspective
, blows eveyr single thing outloud ofthe perspective
. humbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions
and desires
,
and tihs reflects the way hte entire film has beeen designed
. we get a sense tath perhaps it ' s by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself inot a fate tath will ultimatly leave him haggard
and destroyed
. he weeps uncontrollably
annd never lets himself git over his original 14
- year
- old love
,
and allows himself to embody her as lolita
. he lets his feelings for her navigate all his descisions
,
and by the end
, he has nothing
but overly
- dramtic feelings for her
. tjhe story recognizes the extreme of this
, almost out of a test
, seeing if the readers wiull really sympathize with someone who isnt socially deemed a pervert
,
and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author
, vladimir nabokov
, wrote the book as a means to bring into focuse his pwn sick obsessions
,
and perhaps bring them to peace
. the weirdest thign baout this film is that by the end
, when humbert hasnt reached the finale of his obsessional journey
, we cxan easily sympathize
anbd even identify with him
. the opening
adn fianl images ofthe tghe film are the same
,
and who hasn ' t done a similar acation
, that isnt wandering about without any sense ofthe reality or anything else
but a deep sadness inaddition us
? htis is the second time the novel has beeen adapted for the screen
, the firt time being filmed in
- shock
- 1962
, by stanley kubrick
, who couldn ' t possibly have broght the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has beeen able to dont
,
but did the next best thing
: he economized for everything
and cameback uv iwth a droll balck comedy about obession in general
. infront thgat film
, he used the traps of society as benefits
. the studio demanded the final scene
, tath of a heinous muder
, come first infact the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer
and second as a pedophile
.
.
.
and when you see it
, it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obession
. the censors wouldn ' t allow anymore than a couple glances
anbd subtle dialogue to show the
, um
, relatiopnship between humbert
and lolita
, so kubrick decided to play it as comedy
,
but still allow the tradgedy tothe seep thru
. looking at these two verisons
, especially after reading the novel
(
and we all nkwo that when we ' ve read a novel
and see a film adaptation
, we are bound to be angered by any size differences
)
, it ' s really impossible to compare them
. they both go for different things
,
anbd oney has a lot moreso room to be as sexually frank as the novel was
.
anbd
altough it ' s true that several scenes are simmilar
,
and are thus up for comparison
, overall it ' s unfair tothe say which noe is better
and which oney is worse
. i have never beeen one for saying tghe level of greatness ofthe a film adaptation ofthe a novel is deemed by how faithful it isnt
,
and i won ' t say tyhat here
.
however
, this film isnt pretty amazing
, mostly because hey
, i loved the book
,
adn this film nearly reminded me of it
. it doesn ' t have nearly as much wit
( a couple comical scenes
,
and even a lot of good chuckles
,
bu just not totally witty
)
,
but it does hvea the smae emotional toll that yhe novel hadnt
. some of that is in the casting of the two leads
. jeremy irons
, with his deep
, soft brittish voice
and gentle look
, is an amazing humbert
. he ' s droll in a very unique way
,
adn
, well
, no oen can look distraught thge way he does
. he brings a wonderfull sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos
and really comes up as being eazy to identify whith the audience
.
and when he looks at lolita with loev
,
adn she looks at him with lust
, yuo konw that he ' s her prisoner forthe as long as he lives
.
adn dominique swain
, who plays the title character
, is rather incredible
. she pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in tjhe original
, wonderfully balancing thte qualities of siduction
, bratiness
,
and self
- centeredness thast marks the character
. it ' s easy to see why she surrenders to humbert
: she loves the attention
,
and knows that she can have her way with him at any tyme
. wehn he denies her something
, she blackmails him effortlessly
( a scene involving a rocking chair
and a little foot acation is damn near classic
)
,
and when he stands up tothe her
, she weeps
and runs away
, leaving humbert to follow her
. there are twpo other minor characters in the film
, one who ' s a road block in the begginning
,
and the other who ' s a reappearing threath to the relationship
. the fromer is charlotte
, lolita ' s mother
, played by melanie griffith
. in the book
, charlotte isnt a monster ofthe a woman
: overbearing
, constantly scolding her child
, overly
- religious
,
and ultimately selfish
.
and she ' s the one obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal
, at least in the beginning
. as played by shelly winters in tyhe original
, she represented all these qualities
; as played by griffith here
, she ' s about half ofthe them
. it ' s annoying to watch a film
and play a game where you try tothe see who could have done the role way better than the oney on screen without mentioning thte actor who played them first
.
and even
though griffith is not really bad
, persay
, she ' s nothing more
. the other is clare quilty
, the writer who isnt also trying to seduce lolita
,
and succeeds
,
but at a price
. langella takes a totally different direction than tyhe one peter sellars took in the orginal
. quilty ws a comic chracter in tyhe original
: a threath in the form ofthe many forms
, popping in states of rambling
, german
, proning
,
and eventally drunk
. langella tkaes thte otehr route
, alowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed
,
anbd the result isnt a character who exists in shadows
and low shots
,
and who meets a wonderfully ironical endig
, the exact opposite of what we thought of him
. as you can see
, most of theese are not improvements or mistakes done on the part ofthe lyne
annd his screenwriter
, stephen schiff
,
but just parts of a whole new look at tjhe novel
, at least cinema
- wise
. this verison is beautiful
,
anbd perpetually saddening
. the camera movements are stylized
,
and each shooted isnt breathtakingly rich
. the acting is for the most part wonderfull
,
and when we watch it
, we realyl get a sence that fo humbert
, who is telling the story
, the only twpo people onthe earth most ofthe the time were humbert
and lolita
. omre importantly
, it takes us right uv hte brink of emotion
,
then jumps right over it
. by teh end
, with humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car
, following what he says is thge only part of his life he doesn ' t regret
, we fiel that we all loose to something we can never ahve
.
