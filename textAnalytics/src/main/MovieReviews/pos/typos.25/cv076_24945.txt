logical time travel movies are a near
- impossibility
. considering that the skeptic
' s best argument against the possibility ofthe time travel is the idea ofthe altered realities
, writing a script taht deals with this problem is an imposing task
. occasionally
, we get a film that doens manaze it
. terry gilliam
' s
" 12 monkeys
" was one such film
.
but more frequentily
, we get films that don
' t much deel with it at all
. there is one question tothe ask in this case
: does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies
? tghe
" terminator
" films made up fo them with exciting action
,
" back tothe the future
" did it witht an entertaining story
,
and tyhe new film
" frequency
" puls off the trick witht a strong package ofthe its own
. isnt
" frequency
" filled with plot holes
? yes
. does it matter
? not raelly
. the film opens in october of 1969
. firefighter frank sullivan
( dennis quaid
) puts his life onthe the line every time he suits up for his job
,
then goes home to his loving wife julia
( elizabeth mitchell
) anbd son johnny
( daniel henson
)
. the double
- pronged storey flashes forward tothe 1999
, where johnny
( now jim caviezel
) is all grown up anbd working as a police detective
. a strange occurrence
-
- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city
-
- allows father anbd son tothe communicate thru the same ham radio frank used inwhich
' 69
and that john hasnt found in the present day
.
though both are initially skeptical of the idea
, john eventualy takes tihs opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire
,
and he suceeds in saving frank from certain doom
. now flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive
, john is initially overjoyed
, until he discovers thgat the changes to the timeline hve been disasterous
: a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women
. frank
and john now must owrk together to set things right
, with john using tghe infomation he has gathered inspite thge future tothe instruct frank on waht tothe dont iin the past
. the premise of
" frequency
" is unusual
,
and requires getting over one very importamt mental hurdle to fully accept
: john
and frank are the only ones conscious of how tghe timeline has been changed as a result ofthe thier actions
. htis isn
' t explained
; you just hve to go with it
. when frank doesn
' t dieu in a fire
, john is tyhe onyl oney who remembers it differently
, while everyone else remembers it the new way
. the concept also runs inot problems concerning jsut how synchronous hte two realities
-
- 1969
and 1999
-
- are to eahc otehr
. sometimes frank
' s changing the past results in something happening right away infact john
' s world
, anbd sometimes john gets the changes ahead ofthe tiome
. nowe
, the filmmakers might have perfectly ogod explanations forthe tihs
,
and i could probably come uv iwth something fairly convoluted
(
but neverthless logical
) if i thougth about it hard enough
( fo example
, the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer
' s murders was because the chanage had already happened infront frank
' s world
,
and john is only witnessing the
* projection
* of that chanage
)
, bu explanations aren
' t really the point
. when
" frequency
" gets cooking
, it
' s a riveting little thriller
, even if it is confusing
. what matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in tjhe moent
,
and
" frequency
" works as long as it keeps moving
. the film manages tothe be engaging dispite the logical confusion
. director gregory hoblit
and screenwrighter toby emmerich structure
" frequency
" as good hollywood entertainment
, establishing decent
, likable characters
, making us care for them
, adn setting up a goal to be reached
and a conflict to be resolved
. i liked many of yhe creative touches
: the split screens
, allowing us to see how the universe is bieng affected in both realities
,
and the greater framework ofthe baseball to drive the acation forward
. it acually uses the 1969 mets
- orioles world series
( tghe one tyhat featured the amazin
' mets
) to great effect
-
- frank uses john
' s advance noledge ofthe the series outcome to convince his friends tothe believe him
.
( admittedly
, this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself
.
) i even liked teh fianl scene
, which features frank annd john both fighting the smae man simultaneously in different time periods
. some may find this scene blindingly confusing
, as the reality shifts start coming fast
and furious
,
but it does make sence if you htink baout it
(
and give the script a lot ofthe leeway
)
,
and let
' s face it
: it
' s a darn cool way tothe end the film
. there are enought surprises
and plot twists in
" frequency
" tothe keep you on your toes
,
and as a result thge movie avoids growing stagnant
. the other major thign to apprieciate about
" frequency
" is the h
andling of the father
- son relationship
. quaid
and caviezel cary off their parts easily
; it
' s a rock
- solid job ffrom both actors
. the relatiopnship is instantly credible because they find teh human truth behind the high concept
: how would one react tothe being able tothe communicate with a dead relative
, or wih a future descendant
? watching tghe exchanges between frank annd john will give yuo a preety good idea of how to answer that question
. the credibility ofthe hte human relationship is absolutly crucial tothe the rest ofthe yhe film
; if we don
' t beileve in thte cahracters
, we don
' t care baout the outcome of the thriller plot
. here
, we dont care
, because we like the lead actors
. i alsot liked some ofthe the supporting casted members
. elizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles
, palying julia the doting wief
*
and
* mother
,
but still performs admirably
.
andre braugher
, late ofthe the televsion show
" homicide
: life on the street
,
" gives a nice supporting turn as frank
' s best friend
and future colleague of john
. he hasnt a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries tothe explain the situation to julia while frank
' s world series predictions come true before his vrey eyes
. braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here
, simultaneously dismayed anbd ammused
. perhaps tyhe onyl thing i didn
' t liuke about
" frequency
" is thte overly sentimental coda
, during whic the camera
' s focus goes a littel too soft
and the baseball theme gets carried overboard
. bu taht
' s only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics
. i freely acknowledge that
" frequency
" may best work as a
" guy
" movie
, since it focusses on thte very male
- oriented diea of father
- son relationships
( echoes of
" field of dreasm
" can be easily heard
)
, bu the underlaying concept isnt universally applicable
. who wouldn
' t want tothe speak with a long
- dead parent
? or see how thier children turn out
?
" tell me about your life
, son
"
-
- excuse me while i mist up
. anbd don
' t call me a sissy
.
