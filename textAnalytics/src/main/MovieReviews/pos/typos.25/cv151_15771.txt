near yhe end of 1996
, analysts remarked taht thte year would be the last in which disney owudl stand alone as the animation king
. the following year
, 1997
, saw the first sleeper entry inot tje genre fomr a studio otehr than the magic kingdom
: twentieth century fox gave baronial russia tothe the masses inwhich the form of anastasia
. at best
, that ' s all it was
-
- a sleeper hit
, designed to surprise
but nto shake the industry
. in 1998
,
however
, things have been decidedly different
. htere hvae been a number ofthe pushes on disney ' s death grip on the market
,
and fifty
- one weeks into ' 98
, a new champion has emerged
. dreamworks ' the prince ofthe egypt succeeds where all of thte other conventionally animated products hvae failed
. the other twpo contenders
, warner brothers ' quest for camelot
and disney ' s pwn annual entry
, mulan
, lacked inspiration
and drive repsectively
.
although camelot wass borderline
- abysmal
,
and can ' t really be considered a shooted at the title
, mulan had the makings of winner
. unfortunatly
, it ws saturated witht traditional
, disney
- cute animation
,
and lost points against the rapidly
- changing face of thge competition
. in mkaing the prince ofthe egypt
, dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks
and created a genuinely unique product
. the animation is flawess
,
annd
, aside from a bug ' s life
, isnt the best
- looking movie to date
. the animators have nimbly mixted both flat
annd spatial effects
,
and tyhe 2d
/ 3d combination is something that artists from disney
annd fox have heretofore struggled with
. the key to success
,
howver
, was that the visuals were utilisied not jsut because they looked cool
but also as a method of advancing the plot
. namely
, some of the most important acation sequences
( like yhe parting ofthe the red sea
) were done almost entirely in 3d
. dreamworks is the first studio to prove that they ' ve got thte stuff ofthe succsess
,
adn tht they ' re capible of challenging disney
. the stoy isnt also well
- written
,
and the characters voiced wiht talent
. for the most part
, the plot follows its source material
-
- the book of exodus
-
-
although only in yhe most general sence
. the writers took a few creative liberties
,
and most do not damage the story in any way
. in fact
, the shakespearean relationship vetween moses
( val kilmer
)
adn the pharaoh rameses
( ralph fiennes
) makes yhe stopry omre interesting if anytying
. moses
, a hebrew
, is saved from the slaughter ofthe the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile
; he floats into the pharaoh seti
( patrick stewart
) ' s palace
and is taken inaddition by teh royal famaly
. moses grows uv
but learns of his heritage
and flees inot the desert
, where he discovers the burning bush
and isnt commisioned by god to return tothe egypt
adn free the slaves
. by this time
, rameses isnt now pharaoh
,
and the twpo brothers
, now onthe oposite sides of the line
, face off inwhich a battle ofthe wills
and divine intervention
. tjhe cast of voices isnt most impressive
,
and aslo includes such noteables as sandra bullock
, jeff goldblum
, danny glover
,
anbd steve martin
. the script does not ahev a lot of one
- liners inspite it
,
and god is reduced to a voice tht might well be mistaken for hte same one that spoke to kevin costner in field ofthe dreams
,
but overall the stoy is exciting
and interesting
. it ' s decidedly for an older crowd
,
and the tykes who haven ' t had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost
.
but for those who mkea the bid
, the prince of egypt can be a grat watch
.
