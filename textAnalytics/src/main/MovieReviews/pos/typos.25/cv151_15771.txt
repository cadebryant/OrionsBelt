near the end of 1996
, analysts remarked that the year would be hte last inaddition whihc disney would st
and alone as the animation king
. the following year
, 1997
, saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other thna the magic kingdom
: twentieth century fox gave baronial russia tothe the masses infront the form of anastasia
. at best
, thast
' s all it wass
-
- a sleeper hit
, designed to surprise bu not shake tghe industry
. inaddition 1998
, howver
, things hve been decidely different
. there have beeen a number of pushes on disney
' s death grip onthe the market
, adn fifty
- one weeks into
' 98
, a new champion has emerged
. dreamworks
' the prince ofthe egypt succeeds where all of yhe other conventionally animated products hve failed
. the other twpo contenders
, warner brothers
' quest for camelot adn disney
' s own annual entry
, mulan
, lacked inspiration
and drive respectively
.
al
though camelot was borderline
- abizmal
, anbd cant
' t really be consdiered a shot at the title
, mulan had hte makings ofthe winner
. unfortunately
, it was saturated with traditional
, disney
- cute animation
,
and lost points against hte rapidly
- changing face of the competition
. in making the prince of egypt
, dreamworks has strayed from all of theese hallmarks
and created a genuinely unique product
. the animation is flawless
, anbd
, aside from a bug
' s life
, isnt the best
- looking movie to date
. tjhe animators have nimbly mixed both flat
and spatial effects
,
and the 2d
/ 3d combination is something that artists from disney
and fox have heretofore struggled with
. the key to success
,
however
, was that the visuals were utilisied nto just because htey looked cool
but alsot as a method ofthe advancing the plot
. namely
, some of the most important action sequences
( liuke teh parting of the red sae
) were done almost entirely inaddition 3d
. dreamworks is the frist studio to prove tyhat they
' ve got the tsuff of success
, annd that they
' re capable of challenging disney
. the story is also well
- written
,
and the characters voiced with talent
. for the most part
, the plot follows its source material
-
- the book of exodus
-
-
al
though only in hte most genaral sense
. the writers took a few creative liberties
, annd most do not dammage the story infront any way
. in fact
, yhe shakespearean relationship between moses
( val kilmer
)
and the pharaoh rameses
( ralph fiennes
) makes the stopry more interesting if anything
. moses
, a hebrew
, is saved from the slaughter of thte firstborn sons by his mother whn she sets him in a basket on thte nile
; he floats into the pharaoh seti
( patrick stewart
)
' s palace adn is taken in by the royal family
. moses grows up bu lerans of his inheritage adn flees into tjhe desert
, where he dicovers the burning bush adn is commissioned by god to return to egypt
and free the slaves
. by this time
, rameses is now pharoh
, anbd the twpo brothers
, now onthe opposite sides of teh line
, face off inspite a battle of wills
and divine intervention
. the cast of voices isnt most impressive
,
and alsot includes such noteables as s
andra bullock
, jeff goldblum
, danny glover
,
and steve martin
. the script does not hvea a lot ofthe one
- liners in it
, adn god isnt reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the smae noe tath speaked to kevin costner in field of dreasm
,
but overall the story is exciting
and interesting
. it
' s decidedly forthe an older crowd
,
and the tykes who haven
' t had a few eyars ofthe religion class will be hopelessly lost
.
but for those who make the bid
, yhe prince of egypt cxan be a great watch
.
