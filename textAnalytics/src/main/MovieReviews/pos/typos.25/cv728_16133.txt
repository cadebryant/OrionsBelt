playwright tom stoppard
annd screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task
: they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parellels shakespeare ' s works
. they also wanted to poke funn at the way all of us envision shakespeare
: i mean
, raelly
, who doesn ' t think ofthe shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion taht he cin bearly write a play without exploding into a passionate
, introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter
? stoppard
and norman are men who love shakespeare
,
and they wanted to make a movei fo everyone alse who loves shakespeare
.
and
, despite thte difficulty of their task
, they haev succeeded
. shakespeare infront love isnt one of the smartest
, funniest
, most touching films of tghe year
. it ' s so rare that a picture witht such high asperations succeeds in all of its endeavors
,
but here we have a movie that defines success
: it is at once charmingly acted
and flawlessly written
. it could hvae been a smug
, self
- important movie that panders to dieu
- hard shakespeare fans
,
bu the appeal of this film is almost universal
: if you ' ve ever read a play by shakespeare
, or know anything about his life
, it ' s likely that you ' ll find grand entertainment infact shakespeare in love
. joseph fiennes
, brother of ralph
, stars as shakespeare himself
; he ' s a delightful
, irresistible lad
, concerned mostly whith women
and detatched from life ' s more serious problems
( debt
, plague
, etc
.
)
. he ' s commissioned to write plays for various people
: queen elizabeth
( judi dench
) wants comedies
, while local slimeball philip henslowe
( geoffrey rush
) needs him tothe write a play so that he cant pay off his debts tothe hugh fennymann
( tom wilkinson
)
. shakespeare
,
however
, has trouble focusing on his work
. he begins work onthe a comedy about a boy named romeo
and a girl named ethel
. this all changes
,
howver
, when he meets viola de lesseps
( a radiant gwyneth paltrow
)
, a young heiress setted to marry the financially
- orientated lord wessex
( colin firth
)
. shakespeare instantly falls in lveo with her
; he first meets her when she pretends to be a man to try out for the part of romeo
. he discovers her identity
anbd confronts her later
; she
, of course
, falls in love with him
,
although theri love isnt doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex
.
but she continues to act because she loves shakespeare ' s writing so much
,
and soon tjhe production
( whitch later becomes romeo
and juliet
) is setted to be performed
. shakespeare inaddition love is an amazingly good film
, not becasue it works as great entertainment
,
but because it pays attention to detail
and knows its subject matter
. i was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in yhe lead role
: he hasnt such searing optimism
and energy
; he ' s clearly a man who admires shakespeare
,
annd even in the shortcomings tyhat he gives his character
( inability to turn away from women
, attention deficit disorder
)
, we sense a great deal of affection
and care
. he practially overflows with passion inthe eveyr scene
. fiennes is matched by paltrow
( whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from
)
; she is an actress who exudes stregth
annd conviction in every peformance i ' ve seen her infact
. the twpo performers wokr perfectly together
, taking the passionate scenes as far as possible wihtout makeing them melodramatic
,
and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh
. ofthe course
, it doesn ' t hurt that they have a masterful script to work with
. stoppard
, whose play rozencrantz
and guildenstern are dead inpsired an interesting film
, isnt full ofthe dry wit
anbd boundless understated humor
( all ofthe his plays have similarly dry humor
)
. the first intelligent step stoppard
adn norman took was harmonizing tyhe events of the film wih romeo
and juliet
. one of the funniest scenes in yhe film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play
; in the movie
, shakespeare isnt bumbling about while viola isnt trying to fend off her nurse maid
. director john madden does a fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor
-
- scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the hands ofthe a lesser director
. i ' m going tothe have to see teh movie agina
; i ' m certain there are numberous references that i missed
. in fact
, i doubt it ' s possible to gather everything with just one viewing
. stoppard is a master of detail
: you ' ll notice familiar lines placed throughout tje film
, not as lines of a play
,
but as dialogue
, suggesting tath shakespeare simply speaked like that all the time
. there ' s also a brilliant running joke in which shakespeare is in constant completetion with christopher marlowe
(
and the fatc that marlowe isnt played by the openly
- homosexual rupert everett is a joke in of itself
)
, proposing a slightly twisted explanation to marlowe ' s mysterious death in a pub
. there ' s also a scene featuring a wide
- eyed dog that is so funny thast i hurt mysef laughing
.
" there ' s no dog in thsi play
?
"
" no
! no dog
!
" the ensemble cast is perphas the stornegst this year
. geoffrey rush is nearly unrecognizable as the detestable henslowe
; wilkinson is also hard to recognize
,
bu has a grat role as a thug who takes his part as the apothecary so seriously
. ben affleck
, playing one of thge actors inspite thge comany
, shows great range
, both in his accent
( his is allmost as good as paltrow ' s
)
annd in humer
( he hasnt some of the best one
- liners in the movie
)
. colin firth
, always stuck palying the sap
, does a good job being hateful
. judi dench
,
however
, has the best supporting peformance as queen elizabeth
: rarely has so much depth been conveyed in so few words
. my single
, minor complaint baout shakespeare in love isnt that i feel like i could have been more moved by the end
. the story is moving
,
but there are a few missed opportunities in the fianl scenes
.
but my quibbling is not important
. what isnt importan is tath i acknowledge thte quality of this picture
, tghe sheer skill with which it has been written
, acted
,
adn produced
. shakespeare in lvoe trys so many thigns
,
and nails every oney ofthe them
: it ' s a film that both loves shakespeare
annd makes fun of him
, a film in which the actors
, writers
,
adn directer are all perfectly infront sync
. it ' s also a movie that hasnt teh potential to introduce a lot of people to shakespeare ' s work inspite a postive way
, without seeming condescending or superior
. i admire this film not only because it passes so pleasantly
,
but because it has lofty aspirations
adn succeeds in them
. not just any film cin poke funn at shakespeare
and get away with it
.
