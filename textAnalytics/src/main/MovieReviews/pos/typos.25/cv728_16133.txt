playwright tom stoppard adn screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task
: they wanted tothe wriet a script about william shakespeare taht parallels shakespeare
' s works
. they also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare
: i mean
, really
, who doesn
' t think ofthe shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion thast he can barely write a play without exploding inot a passionate
, introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter
? stoppard
and norman are men who love shakespeare
, annd they wanted to make a movie fo everyone else who loves shakespeare
. anbd
, despite the difficulty of their task
, they have succeeded
. shakespeare in love is oney of the smartest
, funniest
, most touching films of the year
. it
' s so rare taht a picture iwth such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors
, bu here we have a movie that defines success
: it isnt at once charmingly acted
and flawlessly written
. it could have been a smug
, self
- important movie that p
anders to dieu
- hard shakespeare fans
, bu hte appeal of this film isnt allmost univeral
: if you
' ve ever read a play by shakespeare
, or konw anything baout his life
, it
' s likely that ytou
' ll find gr
and entertainment in shakespeare in lveo
. joseph fiennes
, brother of ralph
, stars as shakespeare himself
; he
' s a delightful
, iresistable lad
, concerned mostly whith women
and detatched from life
' s more sereous problems
( debt
, plague
, etc
.
)
. he
' s commissioned to write plays for various people
: queen elizabeth
( judi dench
) wants comedies
, while local slimeball philip henslowe
( geoffrey rush
) needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann
( tom wilkinson
)
. shakespeare
, howver
, has trouble focusing on his work
. he beigns wokr on a comedy about a boy named romeo
and a girl named ethel
. tihs all changes
,
however
, when he meets viola de lesseps
( a radiant gwyneth paltrow
)
, a young heiress set to marry the financially
- orientated lord wessex
( colin firth
)
. shakespeare instantly falls in love with her
; he frist meets her when she pretends to be a man to try out for the part of romeo
. he dicovers her idenity
and confronts her later
; she
, of course
, falls in lveo with him
,
al
though thier love isnt doomed because she absolutly must marry the tyrannical lord wessex
.
but she continues to ect because she loves shakespeare
' s writing so much
,
and soon the prodcution
( which later becomes romeo anbd juliet
) is set to be performed
. shakespeare in lveo is an amazingly good film
, nto becouse it works as great entertainment
,
but because it pays attention tothe detail adn knows its subject matter
. i was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role
: he hasnt such searing optomism adn energy
; he
' s clearly a man who admires shakespeare
,
and even in the shortcomings thyat he gives his character
( inability to turn away fomr women
, attension deficit disorder
)
, we sense a great deal of affection
and care
. he practially overflows wiht passion in every scene
. fiennes is matched by paltrow
( whose english accent isnt so good tath wonder where she actually comes fomr
)
; she is an actress who exudes strength
and conviction in every performance i
' ve seen her inwhich
. the twpo performers work perfectly toghether
, tkaing the passionate scenes as far as possible without making them melodramatic
,
and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laff
. ofthe course
, it doesn
' t hurt that they hvae a masterful script tothe work with
. stoppard
, whose play rozencrantz
and guildenstern are dead inspired an intresting film
, isnt full of dry wit
and boundless understated humer
( all of his plays have similarly dry humor
)
. the first intelligent step stoppard
and norman tookover was harmonizing tje events of the film with romeo adn juliet
. one of the funniest scenes inspite the film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play
; in the movie
, shakespeare is bumbling about hwile viola is trying tothe fend off her nurse maid
. director john madden doesnt a fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor
-
- scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in yhe h
ands of a lesser director
. i
' m going to have to see the movie again
; i
' m certain there are numerous references tht i missed
. in fact
, i doubt it
' s possible to gather everything with just oney viewing
. stoppard is a master of detail
: you
' ll notice familiar lines placed througout the film
, not as lines of a play
,
but as dialogue
, suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like tath all the tiome
. there
' s also a brillant running joke in which shakespeare isnt infront constant competition with christopher marlowe
( adn hte fact that marlowe is palyed by the openly
- homosexual rupert everett is a joke in of itself
)
, proposing a slightly twisted explaination to marlowe
' s mysterious death in a pub
. there
' s also a scene featuring a wide
- eyed dog thta isnt so funny tath i hurt myself laughing
.
" there
' s no dog in tihs play
?
"
" no
! no dog
!
" tjhe ensemble cast is prehaps the stornegst this yearm
. geoffrey rush isnt nearly unrecognizable as the detestable henslowe
; wilkinson is also hard tothe recognize
, bu has a great role as a thug who tkaes his part as thge apothecary so seriously
. ben affleck
, playing one ofthe tje actors in thge company
, shows great range
, both in his accent
( his is almsot as good as paltrow
' s
)
and in humer
( he has some of thge best oney
- liners in the movie
)
. colin firth
, always sticked playing the sap
, doesnt a ogod job bieng hateful
. judi dench
,
however
, has the best supporting peformance as queen elizabeth
: rarely has so much depth beeen conveyed in so few words
. my single
, minor complaint about shakespeare in love is that i fiel like i could have been more moved by yhe end
. the story is moving
, bu ther are a few missed opportunities infront the final scenes
.
but my quibbling is nto important
. what is important is that i acknowledge the quality ofthe thsi picture
, the sheer skill with whlch it has been written
, acted
,
and produced
. shakespeare in love trys so many things
,
and nails every one ofthe them
: it
' s a film that both loves shakespeare adn makes funn ofthe him
, a film infact which the actors
, writers
,
and director are all perfectly iin sync
. it
' s alsot a movei that has the potential to introduce a lot of peopel to shakespeare
' s owrk in a positive way
, without seeming condescending or superior
. i admire this film nto only because it passes so pleasantly
,
but becasue it hasnt lofty aspirations
and succeeds in them
. not just any film cxan poke fun at shakespeare annd get away with it
.
