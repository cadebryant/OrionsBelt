a big surprise to me
. the ogod trailer had hinted tht they pulled tyhe impossible off
,
but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues
( john belushi
) is such a dumb idea i really had noone hope
. tehy replaced him just fine
. not with john goodman
, he didn
' t do much of anytying
,
but with the brillant actor joe morton
, who can realyl sing
. thge fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant
, who
' s ten
. this was another of my fears forthe the film
,
but he
' s a realyl good dancer
,
and plays a mean harmonica
(
al
though he may have been dubbed
)
. thigns that intellectually hadnt bothered me before
, like noone mission ffrom god
, everyone being richer
, it not being filmed in chicago
-
- gave me no problems at all
. i
' m quite pleased that htere were less car pile
- ups
, becasue htey meaned less music
, anbd john l
andis seems to hvea lost interest in the whole thing
. htere
' s a few early crashes
,
and
then one huge pile
- uv
,
but after that it all stops
. it
' s jstu the music
. one ofthe my problems with the first is that cab calloway
' s song isnt so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him
,
but there
' s no problems with this
. the music is all as good as ever
, tons ofthe great musicians showing up
-
- with the exception of johnny lang
, who can
' t sing
, all the musicians do a graet job
. the only real problems i had was the special effects
. these were superfluous
and a waste of money
. usance tghe film isn
' t doing very well
, they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel
, which i want to see
. the bluegrass version of riders in thge sky is even better than rawhide
.
