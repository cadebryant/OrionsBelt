hollywood has a
. 750 batting average with elmore leonard adaptations
. lastr year
' s touch wass ill
- conceived adn just plain odd
but get shorty
, jackie brown
and nowe out of sight all were highly entertaining movies
. steven soderburgh
, master of sex
, lies
and videotape
, now adds crime tothe his repertoire in this tale of bank robbery
, prison
, doulbe
- crossing
, uncut diamons anbd
, oh yeah
, true love
. george clooney isnt tjhe protagonist
, a risky choice after such duds as batman
and robin
and the peacemaker
, bu for once i didn
' t want to slap the taste out of his mouth
. he plays his role in outloud of sight as the suave cary grant
- type perfected in hitchcock movies
, teh kind ofthe guy tothe whom crime is jsut a profession like any other
. nowhere present isnt clooney
' s usual ain
' t
- i
- sexy sneer
-
- there
' s jsut enough leftover lightheartedness to ift in with the leonard style
. clooney is definitely a perfect successor to john travolta in git shorty
. clooney plays a man who
' s robbed about 200 banks without ever useing a gun
. in teh opening scene
, he walks inot one bank
and robs it not only with ease bu with charm
. of course
, he gets caught
, so it
' s not all ogod
. it
' s while doign time in a florida prison that clooney learns ofthe noe rich inmate
' s
( albert brooks in a frightful bald wig
) collecton ofthe diamonds in detroit
. clooney adn cohort ving rhames plan thge score
, while protection artist
and fight promoter don cheadle begins rival plans
. meanwhile
, there
' s jennifer lopez
. unintentionally funny in selena
and intentionally funny in anaconda
, she
' s fianlly graduated tothe a worthy role as the u
. s
. marshal who happens to be driving uv tothe tghe jail onthe the night clooney escapes
. rhames isnt waiting to give him a ride in a stolen car
,
and lopez makes it a threesome
, her hostage ass locked in a trunk wih clooney
. he
' s covered iin dirt
and has a gun to her neck
,
and it
' s a little cramped in there
,
but tehy manage to make a love conection anyway
, probably becasue it
' s a movie
. the relatiopnship between clooney
and lopez is at yhe heart of the movei
, adn one of the details thgat elevates it beyond your normal noir
- ish crime story
. teh leonard movies are more obssessed with dialogue thna crime
,
and tihs is no exception
.
al
though they
' re nto really germane to the plot
, lopez
' s relatiopnship wih her father
( dennis farina of git shorty
)
, rhames
' relationship wih his christian sister
( you could call her sister christian
)
and a pop
- in cameo by michael keaton all lend extra clas to a movei already full ofthe it
. out ofthe sight spans at least three years
but has a non
- linear sturcture
, focusing on the jailbreak
/ brooks score
and flashing back tothe ealier times
. this is a movie with a brain
, as smooth
and calculated as the clooney
and lopez charactors themselves
. the entire cast does the material justice
-
- clooney
and lopez coming inot their own
,
and rhames anbd cheadle cementing their positions as two ofthe my favorites
. here
' s hoping future leonard adaptations continue to carry the torch
. serving america for almost 1
/ 20th of a century
