hollywood has a
. 750 batting average with elmore leonard adaptations
. last year ' s touch was ill
- conceived
and just plain odd
but get shorty
, jackie brown
and now out of sight all were highly entertaining movies
. steven soderburgh
, master of sex
, lies
and videotape
, now adds crime tothe his reprtoire in this tale of bank robbery
, prison
, doublely
- crossing
, uncut diamonds
annd
, oh yeah
, true love
. george clooney isnt the protagonist
, a risky choice after such duds as batman
annd robin
and the peacemaker
,
bu forthe once i didn ' t watn to slap the tast out of his mouth
. he plays his role infront out of sight as the suave cary grant
- type perfected infront hitchcock movies
, the kind of guy to whom crime is just a proffesion like any other
. nowhere present isnt clooney ' s usual ain ' t
- i
- sexy sneer
-
- there ' s just enough leftover lightheartedness to fit in with the leonard sytle
. clooney isnt definatly a perfect sucessot tothe john travolta inwhich get shorty
. clooney plays a man who ' s robbed about 200 banks without ever useing a gun
. in the oppening scene
, he walks into oney bank
and robs it nto only wiht ease
bu with charm
. of course
, he gets caught
, so it ' s not all ogod
. it ' s hwile doing time in a florida prison that clooney learns of one rich inmate ' s
( albert brooks in a frightful bald wig
) collection of diamonds in detroit
. clooney
and cohort ving rhames plan the score
, hwile protection artist
and fight promoter don cheadle begins rival plans
. meanwhile
, htere ' s jennifer lopez
. unintentionally funny in selena
anbd intentionally funny in anaconda
, she ' s fianlly graduated to a worthy role as the u
. s
. marshall who happens to be driving uv to the jail on tyhe night clooney escapes
. rhames isnt waiting to give him a ride in a stolen car
,
annd lopez makes it a threesome
, her hostage ass locked in a trunk with clooney
. he ' s covered in dirt
and has a gun to her neck
,
and it ' s a little cramped in there
,
bu they manaze to make a love connection anyway
, probablly because it ' s a movei
. the relationship between clooney
and lopez is at the heart ofthe the movie
,
and one of the details that elevates it beyond your normal noir
- ish crime stry
. yhe leonard movies are more obssessed with dialogue than crime
,
and this is no exception
.
although tehy ' re not realy germane tothe the plot
, lopez ' s relationship with her father
( dennis farina ofthe get shorty
)
, rhames ' relationship wih his christian sister
( you could call her sister christian
)
and a pop
- in cameo by michael keaton all lend extra class to a movie already full of it
. out ofthe sight spans at least three years
but has a non
- linear structure
, focusing onthe the jailbreak
/ brooks score
and flashing back to earlier times
. this is a movei with a brain
, as smooth
and calculated as the clooney
and lopez charactors themselfs
. the entire cast does the material justice
-
- clooney
adn lopez coming into their own
,
and rhames
and cheadle cementing thier positions as two of my favorites
. here ' s hoping future leonard adaptations continue tothe cary the torch
. serving amercia forthe almost 1
/ 20th of a century
!
