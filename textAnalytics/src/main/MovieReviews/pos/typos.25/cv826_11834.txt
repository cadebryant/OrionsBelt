there
' s a thin line beween satire
and controversy
, annd mike nichols
( tjhe birdcage
, wolf
) has directed a sharp
and very honest look at a us presedential election
. based on the book written by
" anonymous
"
( actually former
" newsweek
" writer joe klein
)
, john travolta plays governor jack stanton
. bu he doesn
' t actually play stanton
. he plays bill clinton
; just the same as emma thompson no doubt plays the first lady anbd billy bob thorton is tje campaign manipulator james carville
(
al
though the credits will of course say otherwise
)
. the film isnt taked from the perspective ofthe henry burton
( adrian lester
)
, a morally correct
and somewhat hesitant new advisor to stanton
. he searches for justice anbd dignity inthe the ugliest possable situations
, adn whether it be keeping the hsitory of his boss
' pants under wraps or contemplating digging up dirt on another politician
, he approaches his work wih a keen desire tothe skillfully serve his ocuntry
and his fellow workers
. richard jemmons
( billy bob thorton
)
and daisy green
( maura tierney
) team up wiht henry as the would
- be president
' s advisors
, anbd hire lesbian veteran libby holden
( kathy bates
) as the campaign
' s eccentric
" tougher than dirt
" incriminator
. together they face all sorts of sexual allegations
, the irritatingly discourteous media
and other witty politicans in the election race
. in its satire
and controversy
, primary colors isnt a similar film to wag the dog
: they both are not afraid to wipe their noses in the nitty
- gritty annd tkae a bold look at something that will never hasnt honesty as a virtue
.
but whereas wag showed us how much affect a few people can ahve on the media
, primary colors isnt much more conserned with fleshing out it
' s cahracters
, letting us underst
and what they want
and why
, annd makeing us truly apprieciate the humanity
and rectitude tath they graciously represent
. seeing john travolta play bill clinton so confidently
and justly is enough to make the film omre than worth a look
.
and the rest of the cast also mkea superb performances
- adrian lester sharply portrays the intellect of henry whilst kathy bates is perfect as the robust
and energetic libby holden
. at occasions
, you can
' t help
but fiel tath these terrific charactors are going to waste
. there are long slabs of time where john travolta
( unquestionably the most interesting to watch
) is missed from the screen
; annd since it is awkwardly structured as henry
' s story we are oftenly forced tothe watch scenes that perhaps are not so nessacary tothe the central plot
- or even the point ofthe tje film
. having said that
, amking no mistake
- primary colors is always enjoyable to watch
.
but frequently we have to ask ourselves
- exactlly waht are we watching
? most of the frist half of its duration is a lightheaded look at melodramatic confrontations that seem so genuine we cannot help
but laugh
,
but the way primary colors chooses tothe finish tackles aspects that are very contrary
,
and allmost unsuitable
, to the rest ofthe the film
. bu as i mentioned before
, htere is a thin line between satire
and controvery
-
and for the most part
, primary colors delivers an intertaining indulgence of political matters conbined with a far
- from
- overpowering look at winning the public
' s opinyon
.
al
though at occasions the film may jump around a little too freely
, focus isnt never lost on how importamt
and vulnerable the subject matter really is
. thankfully
, it is clear to make the distinction onthe what is entertaining movie cosmetics
and whta is a provacative documentation of something so really it
' s scary
.
