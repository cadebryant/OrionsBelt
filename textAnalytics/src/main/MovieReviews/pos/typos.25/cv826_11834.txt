there ' s a thin line bewteen satire
annd controversey
,
and mike nichols
( the birdcage
, wolf
) has directed a sharp
and very honest look at a us presidential election
. based on thte book written by
" anonymous
"
( actually fromer
" newsweek
" writer joe klein
)
, john travolta plays governor jack stanton
.
but he doesn ' t actually play stanton
. he plays bill clinton
; jsut the same as emma thompson no doubt plays the firt lady
annd billy bob thorton is the campaign manipulator james carville
(
although the credits wiull of course sday otherwise
)
. the film is taken from the prespective of henry burton
( adrian lester
)
, a morally correct
and somewhat hesitant new advisor to stanton
. he searchs for justice
and dignity in the ugliest possable situations
,
annd whether it be keeping the history of his boss ' pants under wraps or contemplating digging uv dirt onthe another politician
, he approaches his work with a keen desire tothe skillfully serve his ocuntry
and his fellow workers
. richard jemmons
( billy bob thorton
)
and daisy green
( maura tierney
) team up with henry as the owudl
- be president ' s advisors
,
and hire lesbian veteran libby holden
( kathy bates
) as the campaign ' s eccentric
" tougher than dirt
" incriminator
. together they face all sorts of sexual allegations
, the irritatingly discourteous media
and other witty politicians in the election race
. infact its satire
annd controversy
, primary colors is a similar film to wag the dog
: they both are not afriad to wipe theri noses in the nitty
- gritty
annd take a bold look at something that iwll never has honesty as a virtue
.
but whereas wag showed us how much affect a few peple can hve on teh media
, primary colors is much more conserned with fleshing outloud it ' s charachters
, letting us understand whta they want
and why
,
and mkaing us truly appreciate the humanity
and rectitude that they graciously represent
. seeing john travolta play bill clinton so confidently
and justly is enough to make the film more tahn worth a look
.
annd the rest of the cast also amking superb performances
- adrian lester sharply portrays the intellect of henry whilst kathy bates is perfect as the robust
adn energetic libby holden
. at occasions
, you can ' t help
but feel that these terrific characters are going tothe waste
. there are long slabs of time where john travolta
( unquestionably the most intresting to watch
) isnt missed fomr teh screen
;
and since it is awkwardly structured as henry ' s story we are often forced to watch scenes that perhaps are nto so necessary to teh central plot
- or even tje point of the film
. haveing said that
, make no mistake
- primary colors isnt alwasy enjoyable to watch
.
but frequently we have tothe ask ourselves
- exactly whta are we watching
? most ofthe the first half of its duration isnt a lightheaded look at melodramatic confrontations tht seem so genuin we cannot halp
but laugh
,
bu the way primary colors chooses to finish tackles aspestus that are veyr contrary
,
and almost unsuitable
, to thge rest of the film
.
bu as i mentioned before
, there is a thin line between satire
and controversy
-
and for the most part
, primary colors delivers an entertaining indulgence of political matters combined with a far
- from
- overpowering look at winning tjhe public ' s oppinion
. altho at occasions the film may jump around a little too freely
, focus isnt never lost on how imporatnt
and vulnerable tyhe subject marter relaly is
. thankfully
, it isnt clera to make tyhe disctinction on what is entertaining movei cosmetics
and what is a provacative documentation of something so really it ' s scary
.
