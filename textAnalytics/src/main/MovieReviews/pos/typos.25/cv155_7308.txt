. this sequence of events enables us to view the lifestyle of a normal gropu of men

. the wedding scenes
, all
though criticized by many as being quite long
, actually enhance even more the purpose of the first act

. michael shows his leadership again by convincing nick that thge onyl way that steven will survive is if tyhe twpo firends play against each other
,
and moreover
, they must play with 3 bullets in the gun

and does not feel at all like a hero
. he wants tothe avoid teh celebrations anbd recognition that his firends woudl like to bestow upon him
