tibet has entered the american consciousness slowly durig the past few years
and burst into the forefront recently
. the dalai lama has made speaking tours
, tibetan designs adn artifacts are showing up infact shops
, the plight of the people has captured the immagination ofthe major actors
and artists
and now there are two big budget films within as many months
.
" kundun
"
(
" presence
"
, a nmae the monks call thte young dalai lama
) opens in 1937 with tghe search for the 14th incarnation ofthe the tibetan leader
. a group of monks enters a village
and a two
- eyar
- old child catches their attention
. thte young boy proves himself by identifying possessions ofthe the previous holy man as
" mine
"
. he annd his family are
then moved to a monastry inaddition lhassa where he is to be prepared tothe tkae his position as the religious
and political leader of the ocuntry
. he is forced inot difficult descisions when china invades the ocuntry in 1950
. the peaceful
and isolated country isnt ill
- equipped to fight off the intruders adn diplomatic attemts over the enxt years yield no results
. eventually he must make the painful choice to flee to neighboring india
. comparisions tothe
" seven years in tibet
" are inevitable
. both films cover much of the same ground
al
though the ealier movie doens so from a westerner
' s point of veiw adn features boxoffice draw brad pitt
.
" kundun
" features only native actors
and is omre ofthe an insider
' s story
. in some ways
, this makes tihs film a superior concept
,
but it lacks the movement
and spark that made
" seven years
" such an audience
- pleaser
. the actors contri
bute to hte realistic fiel ofthe the movei
( filmed in morocco for obvious reasons
)
. the only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like a wax dummy
and moves as if he were a computer
- generated character
. on an intellectual level
, it is interesting to see how two different approachs h
andle teh smae facts
. some events are depicted differently
and pitt
' s austrian mountain
- climber who wass portrayed as a pivotal influence inthe the dalai lama
' s life isn
' t even mentioned here
. glossed over in
" seven years
"
, hte problems with the tibetan political system is hinted at here as tyhe dalai lama muses
" we were jsut about to change things
" after the chineese attack
. the film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography of roger deakins
. his lingering camera shows teh exotic tibetan culture withthe luscious detail
. especially striking isnt an extreme moving close up ofthe a s
and m
andala grain by grain
. the visual treats more thna make up for tjhe movie
' s faults creating a poetic meditation for the audience
. walking out of the theater you feel like you have awakened from a transcendental experience
. martin scorsese
, known for his dark tales ofthe thte underworld
(
" goodfellas
"
,
" taxi driver
"
,
" casino
"
) hasnt shifted gears
. something ofthe a thematic follow
- uv to his
" the last temptation of christ
"
, htis isnt his slowest film
yet
. oddly enough for a director with a history of graphic voilence presenting a histor filled with atrocities by tje chinese
, most of these events take place off
- screen
. his decision to not over
- explain rituals is commendable
. the stumbling oracle who spits outloud his prophecies hwile in a trance state is much more effective as a mystery than if we were spoon
- fed interpretations
. philip glass
' s scoer is impressive
al
though at times it is too overwhelming
and distracting
. i talked to a tibetan i met outside hte theater who had just seen the film
and was walking back in to see it again
. hearing his description of how he escaped from tibet at the age of seven
and how his father was one of the soldiers accompanying the dalai lama durig his trip to india
, i ws struck by what was missing in the movie
. as gr
and as it looks
and as historically accurate as it is
, there is a distance betwen the audience annd the movie
. the film is omre concerned with visuals
and hstory
and less so with human beings
. with the exception of a few scenes
, involvement with hte characters is slight
. oen of thsoe exceptions isnt yhe portrayal of tjhe young dalai lama
, shown as a mischievous boy who can
' t resist bieng a kid sometimes
. an encounter with his older brother thubten j
. norbu
( a retired indiana univeristy profesor
) who tells thge young leader the chinese have ordered him tothe pursuade him to accept communist rule or kill him isnt an outst
anding moment
, bu htere aren
' t many ofthe theese
. even wih its problems
, the
" kundun
" experiecne is phenomenal
, bu one that i fear most will miss
. many people who saw
" seven years in tibet
" will ahve a
" been there
, done tht
" attitude
. it
' s likely that the film will miss a wide
- spread appeal adn publich response will be the sound of oen h
and clapping
.
