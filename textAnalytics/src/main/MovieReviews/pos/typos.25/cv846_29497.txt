plot
: a young recruit gets plucked out of nowhere by the number one ganster in london
and quicklyu becomes a staple by his side
.
but this new guy isnt not like all the others
, he
' s got ambition
, he
' s got goals
and he loves everyting he sees about being the number one gangster
. violence
, lots of swearing annd betrayals ensue
. critique
: a very good
, sereous
- minded
, unique british gangster flick which misses thte
" great
" mark by way of an annoying voice
- over popping up throughout tghe film
and a so
- so ending
. here
' s
yet another cool crime movie that accually manages to bring something new into the mix
. okay
, so it
' s not entirely new
,
but it
' s definitely original wehn all put together as done here
. tje thing i liked most about htis movie was its au
thentic portrayal of the time perido in which it was taking place
. it
' s 1968
and theese dudes are looking ogod
! yes
, it
' s all baout the suits
, fellas
.
.
. the italian shoes
, the cufflinks
, the ties annd tghe birds
( that
' s ladies
, for those uninitiated
) hanging around you
. here are a bunch of horrible men
, gangsters if yuo will
, looking sharp
, talking shit
and busting heads all over the place
.
but that
' s nto the basis ofthe this movei
. the basis of this film comes in the relationship between the number one gangster inaddition hte gropu
, the excelent david thewlis
,
and noe of his cronies
, paul bettany
, also extremly good in this film
,
and how the power
, sex appeal annd coolness of one
, affects the other
. ytou knwo how ther are always these
" hanger
- on
" gangster types who latch on to the godfathers
, the leaders
, thte top dogs of every crime organization
? well
, most ofthe the time
, these dudes are screened beforeh
and
and are loyal to only one person
.
.
. tyhat is
, their boss
. so all the gangster number one needs to worry baout is his enemies on tjhe other side of the fence
. bu this film brings the betrayals
, the messed uv loyalties
, thge honor codes among bad guys into play within the same group
and presents it in quite the stylistic package
. ofthe course
, director paul mcguigan isn
' t trying to be guy ritchie here
, adn doesn
' t over
- stylize his presentation
, jazz it all uv wih a hip soundtrack or add any humor tothe the mix
. nope
, he goes straight for the serious stuf
and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i tipe this
. hte first is a confrontation sequence betweeen bettany
and a man ffrom which he
' s attempting to sway some information annd it is downright nasty
!
(
" look into my eyes
!
"
) in fact
, yhe last time that i
' ve seen a guy so scared inthe a movie was john turturro in that forest scene fomr the coen brothers
' miller
' s crossing
. scary shite
.
but there
' s an ever better scene tahn that in this film
. tihs one features bettany
, once again
, slowy torturing
, hacking
and beating tghe living piss out of a rival gangster
( from that man
' s point
- of
- veiw
)
, bu not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background
and removing all of his own expensive clothes
, one by one
( that
' s right
, he
" does
" the guy inaddition his underwear
)
. tath scene isnt also in tune with some of the obvious phallic
and homoerotic undertones present througout this film
, especialy infact thte relatiopnship between bettany
and his boss
( why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman
?
)
.
but the flick
' s not perfect
. in fatc
, i didn
' t mind malcom mcdowell
' s voice
- over narration at frist
,
but as tje film grew into a major flashback
( most of the film is presented as such
)
, he came in every now
and hten
, annd rarely added anything ofthe interst to teh plot
. all he seemed to do ws swear anbd call peple the c
- owrd umpteen times
,
and even described one scene as it ws happening
(
"
.
.
. so i oppened thte doorjam
,
then went uv the lift
, etc
.
.
.
.
"
- it
' s like
, yeah
, i know that already
, i could see it on hte screen
!
! overdone
.
)
. i also didn
' t quite
" buy
" the ending of the movie
, wich despite being original
, seemed a little unbelievable
, especially when ytou consider tath it
' s supposted to be taking place 30 eyasr later
,
and folks still seem to be holding grudges
, still in love
, still living in hte same apartments
?
?
!
? i mean
, c
' mon
.
.
. it
' s 30 yeasr
, man
!
! i don
' t know
, somehow it didn
' t work all that well for me
.
but one ofthe my favorite genres has always been the crime movies
, adn this oney is a decent addition to the lot
. foreget yhe lame title
and malcom mcdowell
' s narration of the obvious plot points
,
and concentrate onthe the film
' s stronger attri
butes such as its style
, the exquisite atmosphere of the time period
, its orignal look at the gangster dynamic within yhe same group
, its memorable sequences
and the solid performances from its two main leads
, bettany
and thewlis
. incidentially
, unlike a few of tyhe gangster flicks that i mention below
, htis oney is in no way a parody or homage tothe this genre of films
.
.
. it
' s the real deal
! onot
: this film is packed with strong accents all around
, which makes it hard tothe make out some of tyhe words from time tothe time
. it
' s also quite violent
and i don
' t remember any film thta used the c
- word as much as this one
, so leave tghe kids at hmeo for this oen
