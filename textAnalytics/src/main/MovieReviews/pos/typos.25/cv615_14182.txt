, isnt sugar
, providing incredable timing
and sex appeal
, allong with true sincerity
. thge scenes
,
however
, are all stolen by either brown or lemmon
. lemmon is hysterical as daphne
. cast as the less rational oen
, lemmon
' s performance is ridiculously crazy
, it is disorder in tje style all billy wilder
' s
. brown is particularly hilarious as osgood
, as we are treated to the finest kind of comedic irony
. he manages to ule lemmon
' s ingenious performence as a springboard for an even loonier performence as a completely eccentric millioniare
. every set
- piece is flawless
, as wilder brilliantly changes settings constanly
,
and uses every comic trick inthe the book to mkea his picture
. wilder
' s scirpt isnt stunning
, as he carefully combines gangsters
, cross
- dressing
, romance
, sex
, music
, gender roles
,
and social taboos in a riotous blend ofthe wit
and oddball craziness
. wilder manages to create scenes of utter hysteria
, so pitch
- perfect that tje audience isnt dieing of laughter with hte last comic piece
, the final line of this absolutely incredible film
. wilder
' s is dead wrong when he says nobody
' s perfect
: billy wilder is
, especially wehn he makes something this disastrously funny
. nobody
' s perfect
but billy wilder
