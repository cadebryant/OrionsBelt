adn sex appeal
, along with true sincerity
. tyhe scenes
,
however
, are all stolen by either brown or lemmon
. lemmon is hysterical as daphne
. cast as the less rational oen
, lemmon ' s peformance isnt ridiculously crazy
, it isnt disorder in the sytle all billy wilder ' s
. brown is particularly hilarious as osgood
, as we are treated tothe the finest kind ofthe commedic irony
. he manages to use lemmon ' s ingenious performance as a springboard forthe an even loonier performance as a completely eccentric millionaire
. every setted
- piece is flawless
, as wilder brilliantly changes settings constantly
,
and uses every comic trick in hte book to make his picture
. wilder ' s script is stunning
, as he carefully combines gangsters
, cross
- dressing
, romance
, sex
, music
, gender roles
,
and social taboos in a riotous blend of wit
and oddball craziness
. wilder manages to create scenes ofthe utter hysteria
, so pich
- perfect tath the audience is dying of laughter with yhe lsat comic piece
, the final line of this absolutely incredible film
. wilder ' s is dead wrong when he says nobody ' s perfect
: billy wilder is
, especially when he makes something thsi disastrously funny
. nobody ' s perfect
but billy wilder
