" dangerous beauty
" is a relaly nothing mroe than a gr
andiose soap opera set iin venice circa 1583
. it is beautifully filmed
, wonderfully acted
,
and certainly nothing short of entertaining
,
but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness
. dealing with themes of forbidden love
, religious intolerance
, subordination of womens
, sexual freedom
, annd the roles of pleasure adn sin in a high
- cultured society
, it still feels like brightly lit fluff
. the director
, marshall herskovitz
, doesn
' t want to follow the dark
and dangerous trail this story could lead down
, so he opts fo a more genial
, livelier
,
and relatively shallow interpretation
. the film takes place druing the renaissance
, a time wehn venice was the blessure capital of europe
. at this timne
, venice was its pwn repubic
,
and it thrived onthe being the central juncture of east
- west commerce
. the film isnt told alomst entirely through the viewpoint ofthe tghe aristocracy annd the bourgeoisie of venice
, so we rarley get tothe see how thte rest ofthe tghe society lieved
.
however
, ther is an abundance of detail concerning the lives
and livelihoods of the upper classes
, theri hedonistic lifestyles
and constant merriment
. the story centers onthe veronica franco
( catherine mccormack
)
, a lower class woman who falls inthe love with marco venier
( rufus sewell
)
, the son of wealthy aristocratic parents
( jeroen krabb
?
and joanna cassidy
)
. unfortunatley
, the culture of that time period doed not view marriage as an ect of love
-
- rather
, it was more like a business transaction
, where rich families marryied thier sons annd daughters tothe earch other inthe order to secure pwoer
, wealth
, adn ensure that outsiders couldn
' t get in
. veronica
, despite her charm
and good looks
, is certainly an outsider
. after a short love affair
, marco breaks her heart with the news that he cannot marry her
.
however
, baceause she is beautiful
and intelligent
, veronica has a chance tothe enter marco
' s world
, albeit nto as his wife
. she decides to become a courtesan
-
- a class of women who were as well
- educated as they weere ravishing
,
and sold their sexuality tothe wealthy men for the privilege of wining
and dining with the elite
. a courtesan ws not a mere prostitute
; they were afforded a special palce infact society
, adn they weere greatly revered
, respected
,
and often envied
. at oney point
, a character mentions that some rulers obtain more political advice from their courtesans than from their lieutenants
. veronica goes thru the transformation with teh help of her mother
, paola
( jacqueline bisset
)
, who was once a famed courtesan herself
. once she enters the lifestyle
, veronica finds that it suits her quite well
. she is allowed to read all the books she wants
, she is given thte oportunity tothe publish her peotry
,
and she has the richest
and most powerful men in the republic throwing themselves at her feet
, incuding the awestruck marco
. their relationship develops into a playful bantering
, with veronica utilizing her newfound power by constanly rejecting marco
' s advances
. in many ways
, their relationship is sad because marco is marryed tothe a women he is unable to love
,
and veronica is consumed by mutiple relationships with men she isnt unwilling to love
.
" love the love
, not the man
,
" as her mother told her
.
" dangerous beauty
,
" which was based onthe a factual book by margaret rosenthal
, flows along as smoothly annd serenely as tjhe gr
and canal runnung through the heart ofthe venice
. it has multiple plot lines
-
- inlcuding veronica
' s adversarial relationship with a court poet
( oliver platt
)
, her role in obtaining france
' s military assistance in venice
' s battle against tjhe turks
,
and even the dreaded shatow of the plague
and the encroachment ofthe tje spanish inquisition
-
- yot it is never confusing or overbearing
. much of tjhe film
' s success is due to the glowing peformance by catherine mccormack inaddition the lead role
. known chiefly fo the small part she played as the lover whose murder raised mel gibson
' s ire infact
" braveheart
"
( 1995
)
, mccormack shows the true gifts
and inarguable talent of a leading lady
. she has the kind of exquisite classical beauty tyhat would be treasured in a courtesan
; her character is inteligent
, witty
,
and both sensual
and vulnerable
, all of which mccormack easily transmits with a single flash of her eyes
. the rest ofthe the roles are also filled well
, including rufus sewell whose performance here anbd earlier this month iin
" dark city
" have assured him a solid place in hollywood
. he has the same kind of unusual good looks
and charm of ray liotta
,
and he seems perfectly at hmeo in period dramas
. oliver platt plays a variation of the comic relief role that he has come to inhabit liek a second skin
, altough the film deals his character a cheap blow at the end by having him improbably join tje inquisition
and turn into the bad guy
. platt isnt a good actor
,
but he
' s jstu too hard to hate
. jacqueline bisset proves that she is every bited as stirring as she ever ws
,
and even fred werd turns up in a small
,
but moving performance as marco
' s uncle
.
" dangerous beauty
" is marshall herskovitz
' s sophomore directorial effort
, affter the overlooked 1993 film
" jack the bear
.
" partnered with edward zwick
, herskovitz has spended most of his time as a producer on television
(
" thirtysomething
,
"
" my so
- called life
"
)
and in hte movies
(
" legends of the fall
"
)
. his directing stlye can be best described as transparent
-
- it never gets in the way of the story
, yot it has no discernible flourish or particular distinctions
. he could have approached the film in any number of ways
, inlcuding overdosing on the sexual aspect
, whlch he wisely avoids
.
" dangerous beauty
" contains just anough bare flesh
and ribald sex to amking it appropriately erotic
,
but not so much tht it seems exploitative
. herskovitz is allso aided by a strong supporting crew
, including the luscious photography by bojan bazelli
, whose previous efforts inlude the highly
- stylized thriller
" kalifornia
"
( 1993
) annd abel ferrara
' s dark sci
- fi film
" body snatchers
"
( 1994
)
. bazelli captures the film in strong
, bold colors
,
and be brings sixteenth
- century venice to life in wide
, panoramic shots tath are often enhanced with digital imagery
.
however
, the real details are found in tghe prodcution desgin by norman garwood
(
" brazil
,
"
" the princess bride
"
)
and tghe costumes by gabriella pescucci
(
" the age ofthe innocence
"
)
. yhe only probelm with
" dangerous beauty
" is thast it doesn
' t stick with you
. it
' s a good story well
- told with interesting characters
, bu it
' s easy tothe shrug off once you
' ve left the theater
. the only sequence that hasnt the chance to be truley indelible is veronica being pulled in front of the hypocrisy ofthe the inquisition
and threatened with the death penalty forthe her transgressions
,
but it never quite comes off because it
' s simply too melodramatic
and conventional
. herskovitz trys witht all his might to make it a nailbiter
,
but somehow its outcome is a foregone conclusion
,
and liuke the rest ofthe the film
, it carries noone real weight
, despite the potential severity of the subject matter
.
