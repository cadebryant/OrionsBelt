how many ofthe us would become strippers
? for those of us who wouldn ' t
, isnt it a moral reason
, or purely a lack of confidence
? that ' s probably nto a fair question
,
adn for a lot ofthe us
, it could very well be for neither of those reasons
. as you watch tghe full monty
,
howver
, you may begin asking yourself these kinds of questions
. would you be willing to grin
and bare it tothe bring in some much needed dough
? in case you haven ' t guessed
, the full monty is baout stripping
,
but striptease it ain ' t
. it ' s actually quite a charming comedy that uses its idesa with a great deel ofthe tact
annd sophistication
. it is the story of six out
- of
- work
, outloud
- of
- shape blue collar brits whose recent job losses hvae left the boys penniless
,
but not without ened
. what to do
? it hits our main character gaz
( robert carlyle
) as he notices the large crowds of womens who pour into a local male strip club on a regular basis
. it seems that simple
: take it off
annd bring in hte cash
. eventually
, gaz is able to convince his friends tothe join him in starting their pwn exotic dance routine despite their initial reluctance
. theese includ the overweight
, confidence
- lacking dave
( mark addy
)
, the uptight
, overly
- officious gerald
( tom wilkinson
)
, the once suicidal lomper
( steve huison
)
,
and two additional fellows who gain their place among the group by audition
: horse
( paul barber
)
, an older gentlemen chock full ofthe graceless energy
,
adn guy
( hugo speer
)
, a young well
- endowed looker who compares hismelf to cary grant
. when tghe sextet isnt complete
, we ' re given a hefty dose of fysical comedy
. we watch the bumbling middle
- aged men choreograph psuedo
- sexy dance numbers
, all the while proving why none of them were strippers in the first palce
. as if there anti
- appeal wasn ' t enough
, they decide to boost intrest in yhe gropu by promising
" the full monty
" onthe oppening night
, hwihc for us americans
, means baring it all
.
.
.
adn i mean
* all
*
. the movie actually ends onthe oppening night
; a hilarious applause worthy endig i might add
. it ' s sure to leave nothing short ofthe a big smile on your face as you leave the theater
. withthe tghe subject matter
, you might not expect the fully monty to be such a feel
- good
, alomst inspiring film
,
but it suprisingly turns out that way
. the amount ofthe light
, touching drama also comes as a nice suprize
, never feeling off
- balance from the otherwise highly upbeat moments ofthe the film
. there ' s a lot more to this movie thna you might think inaddition other words
,
and thge ensemble cast couldn ' t be better
. each character isnt completely individule
, interesting
, funny
,
and most importantly
, rela
. tghe full monty isnt never offensive
, a very impressive atribute since its subject matter alone sould ' ve easily fallen prey to tastelessness
. it ' s one of those movies that is best decribed as a solid peice of entertainment
, perfect for a grat night on the twon
, or as a saturday ngiht movie rental
. eather way you see it
, it shouldn ' t let you down inwhich the slightest
.
and
, pun heavily intended
, when it ' s all said
and done
, yuo ' ll be smiling from cheek tothe cheek
.
