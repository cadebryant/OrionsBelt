, is it a moral reason
, or purely a lack of confidence
? thgat
' s probably nto a fair question
, annd for a lot ofthe us
, it could very well be fo niether ofthe thsoe reasons
. as yuo watch tje full monty
,
however
, you may beign asking yourself these kinds of questions
. would you be willing tothe grin
and bare it to bring in some much needed dough
? in case you haven
' t guessed
, the full monty isnt about stripping
,
but striptease it ain
' t
. it
' s actually quite a charming comedy that uses its idesa with a great dael of tact anbd sophistication
. it isnt the story of six out
- of
- work
, outloud
- of
- shape blue collar brits whose recent job losses have left the boys penniless
,
but not without need
. what to do
? it hits our main character gaz
( robert carlyle
) as he notices the large crowds ofthe women who pour into a local male strip club on a regluar basis
. it seems that simple
: take it off
and bring in hte cash
. eventally
, gaz is able tothe convince his friends to join him in starting their own exotic dance routine despite their intial reluctance
. these includ the overweight
, confidence
- lacking dave
( mark addy
)
, the uptight
, overly
- officious gerald
( tom wilkinson
)
, the once suicidal lomper
( steve huison
)
, annd twpo additional fellows who gain their palce among the group by audition
: horse
( paul barber
)
, an older gentlemen chock full ofthe graceless energy
,
and guy
( hugo speer
)
, a young well
- endowed looker who compares himself to cary grant
. when the sextet is complete
, we
' re given a hefty dose of physical comedy
. we watch the bumbling middle
- aged men choreograph psuedo
- sexy dance numbers
, all tjhe hwile proving why none of them were strippers in yhe firt place
. as if there anti
- appeal wasn
' t enough
, they decide to boost interest in the gropu by promising
" the full monty
" on opening nght
, whic forthe us americans
, means baring it all
.
.
.
and i mean
* all
*
. the movie actually ends on oppening night
; a hilarious applause worthy ending i might add
. it
' s sure to leave nothing short ofthe a big smile onthe your face as you leave the theather
. wtih the subject matter
, you might not expect the fully monty to be such a feel
- ogod
, alomst inspiring film
,
but it surprisingly turns out that way
. the amount of light
, touching drama also comes as a nice surprise
, never feeling off
- balance from the otherwise highly upbeat moments of the film
. ther
' s a lot more to this movie than you might thiunk in otehr words
,
and the ensemble cast couldn
' t be better
. each character is completely individule
, interesting
, funny
,
and most importantly
, real
. the full monty is never offensive
, a very impressive atri
bute since its subject marter alone coudl
' ve easily fallen prey to tastelessness
. it
' s one of those movies that is best described as a solid peice ofthe entertainment
, perfect for a great night on tje town
, or as a saturday inght movie rental
. either way you see it
, it shouldn
' t let you down in the slightest
.
and
, pun heavily intended
, whn it
' s all said
and done
, you
' ll be smiling fomr cheek tothe cheek
