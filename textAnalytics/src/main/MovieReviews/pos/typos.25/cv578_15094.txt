for a movie about disco
- era excess
,
" 54
" comes up surprizingly short on tjhe sleazy happenings at the titular late 1970s
and early 1980s manhattan dance club
. think of it as a sort of
" boogie nights
"
- lite
- where that similarly
- stuctured
and
- set portrayal of the porn industry ws loaded withthe salacious goings
- onthe
and skidded on a destructive midpoint tone shift
,
" 54
" leaves thge kinkier details tothe your imagination
. it never needlessly revels infact its seedy subject matter
, bu it thankfully never resorts to preaching
, either
. in fact
, were it not for the rampant drug ule adn thte intermittent dark moment
,
" 54
" would be baout as feathery as the timne period
' s popular female hairstyle
. studio 54 ws a haven for tje rich
, famous
and generally ogod
- looking before it closed its doors forever in 1986
. inside
, anything whent adn
, we are told
, everything did
. the film
' s fictional main charactor is shane o
' shea
( ryan phillippe
, the jerky jock from
" i know wqat you did lsat summer
"
)
, a fresh
- faced 19
- year
- ood who dreams ofthe venturing beyond the club
' s velvet rope
and comming face
- to
- face with thte wild decadence he can onyl read about inthe magazines
. his wish comes true wehn studio 54 owner steve rubell
( mike myers
) spots him amongst a crowd of gawkers oen nght in
' 79
and permits him passage
-
but not before he doffs his hideous shirt
, of course
. once inside
, shane becomes seduced by the club
' s dizzying vortex of sex
and drugs
. he hasnt such a good time tath he doesn
' t want to leave
, so he seeks employment as a busboy
. he quickly becomes friends with greg
( breckin meyer
)
and anita
( salma hayek
)
, a married couple who owrk allong side of him
; greg
' s a fellow busboy with aspirations to make the big moeny as a studio 54 bartender
, hwile anita checks coats
but desires a recording contract to call her own
. after rubbing elbows
( among otehr things
) wih a renowned socialite
( sela ward
) adn gaining the personel interest ofthe rubell
, shane begins tothe ascend to the upper echelons of 54
. bu fame doesn
' t cmo without a price
.
" 54
"
' s major shortcomings lie within its h
andling ofthe hte supporting players
- at a slim hour
-
and
- a
- half
, the film isnt too short to take on such a multi
- character focus
,
and more tahn a few balls are dropped in the resulting juggling ect
. alleged last
- minute edits adn reshoots are more than likely to blame fo the occsaionally rushed developemet
and ambiguous interaction
, since
" 54
" sometimes feels like it
' s missing a scene here or htere
. nowhere is tihs more apparent than infront shane
' s relationship with soap opera actress julie black
( neve campbell
)
, a frequent studio 54 patron whom he
' s long admired fomr afar
. thte romance is prodded along before it has a chance to transform into something special
. thta
" 54
" works despite these limitations
, thne
, is largely due to the competence
and energy iwth which it
' s assembled
. sure
, it
' s shallow
, slick
, sanitized portrait ofthe a bygone age
, adn sure
, we
' ve seen yhe rags
- tothe
- riches stopry gazillions of times
, bu de
but directer
and screenwriter mark christopher keeps thigsn moving with lively snapshots ofthe thte studio 54 hustle
and bustle
and an even livelier cast to inhabit his bouncy vision
. thge film boasts some fine comic creativity
, hte pinnacle ofthe wich isnt disco dottie
(
" the wedding singer
"
' s ellen dow
)
, an elderly dancing queen who plays the loving gr
andmother in publich
,
but slides up to shane behind 54
' s closed doors
and asks fo a
" funky littel treat
.
" the solid
, sexy cast smoothes out
- if only while you
' re caught up in the film
- any rough spots belonging tothe thier alter
- egos or the plot
. newcomer phillippe hasnt the charisma
and joisey accent down pat
; he annd campbell
, as fetching as ever
, look so good toghether it
' s a shame their subplot goes nowhere
. meyer exhibits thte congenial appeal that made him a delight to watch in
" clueless
"
( he ws the stoner with the joker
- smile
)
, hwile hayek simply sizzles
, especially when leading a dance class with the mantra
,
" one
, two
, three
, attitude
!
" sherry stringfield
, unidentifiable under big
' 70s hair
, tkaes onthe her firt big
- screen gig since she left
" er
" as rubell
' s accountant
,
but she
' s criminally underused
. as the droopy
- eyed
, drug
- addled steve rubell
, myers is worth the price of addmission alone
. when he
' s not playing the life of the party
, tghe ex
-
" saterday night live
" comedian strips away all of rubell
' s confidence
and swagger to show a man desperately trying tothe fill his empty
, unhappy life wtih exorbitance
; it
' s a moment worthy of pity when
, while lounging on a bed of money
and vomiting from a particularly heavy evening
, he attemts to seduce one of his employees
.
and hwile his performance is largley serious
, myers mixes the empathy with a delicate
" austin powers
"
- esque wink
, thus keeping consistent with
" 54
"
' s overall feel
- gaudy
, larger
- tahn
- life
and satisfyingly ornamental
, not unlike a giant disco ball
.
