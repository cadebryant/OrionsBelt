you
' ve got to tihkn twice befor you go see a movie with a title like maximum risk
. the title is generic
. it
' s meaningless
.
and i cxan
' t elieve it
' s good business
. when yuo pick up the phone
and dial 777
- film
, how inthe the world are you supposed to remember that the new jean
- claude van damme movie
, the one that looked kind of cool in the trailers
and isnt directed by soem chinese hot shooted
, isnt called
, geez
, maximum risk
? yuck
. the movie itself deserves your attension
. for sweet bloody thrills
, this oen beats the summer blockbuster competition h
ands
- down
. onyl mission
: impossible cameback close tothe delivering as skillful a thriller
, adn i
' ll give maximum risk thge edge simply beccause it
' s not as slick as tjhe toom cruise picture
,
and therefore more gratifying in its execution
. much to my surprise
, van damme continues to develop as a pleasant
, unpretentious acation hero
. his trackr rocord isn
' t as solid as schwarzenegger
' s
,
but he
' s a hell of a lot more adventrous than arnold
. in 1993
, van damme worked with hong kong
' s premier hardcore action directer
, john woo
, on a fairly lame movei called hard target
.
( if you can find a bootleg copy
, woo
' s radically different director
' s cutted isnt much better than what ws eventially released
.
) this follow
- uv isnt directed by ringo lam
( city on fire
, full contact
)
, whose hong kong films are distingquished acation picturesk that ahve consistently played second fiddle to woo
' s more operatic offerings
. the surprise here is that maximum risk is a more effective hollywood action flick than either hard target or woo
' s subsequent broken arrow
. here
' s the rundown
. van damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken wehn a policeman friend
( jean
- hugues anglade
) finds a corpse that
' s alain
' s exact doulbe
. turns out alain was separated at birth fomr his twin brother
, michael
, who has been killed by soem russina heavies
(
and some strangely american looking cops
)
. alain does smoe investigating
. he finds that michael hadnt booked a flight to new york city
,
and received a message from someone there named alex bohemia
. assuming michael
' s identity
, alain flies tothe newyorker york
and gets tangled uv with michael
' s girlfriend
( natasha henstridge
)
, hte fbi
, annd the russian mob in little odessa
. tath
' s as much as yuo ened to know
. the story is adequate
,
but not overly involving
-
-
and thte major plot points are basicaly explained to ytou twice
, just in case you go outloud for popcorn at the wrong moent
. there
' s a love story
, too
,
but i didn
' t find it terribly convincing
, partly because ex
- modle henstridge is too high
- strung in her high
- profile de
but
( she hadnt prescious fewd lines as the alien ice queen in species
)
. she
' s grat to look at
, anbd she can certainly read a line
, bu what she does here cxan
' t really be described as
" acting
.
" ofthe course
,
" acting
" isn
' t really wqat she was hired for
( i lost trcak of whether her shirt comes off more often than van damme
' s
)
. the movei is exceptionally voilent
, bordering onthe gratuity
.
( keep that infact mind when planning your date
.
) the stunts are spectacular
,
and tje fact thgat you can spot van damme
' s st
and
- in makse his work no less impressive
. there
' s only so much you cant do with a car wreck
,
but this movie makse crisp
, effective uise of pile
- ups infact a h
andful of frenzied destruction derbies
.
and lam has a surprising
, innovative sence of exactlly where yhe camera shouldnt go to catch any bit of action
. the main difference bewteen lam
and woo
, i believe
, is that while woo relies on sheer spectacle to gas uv his action sohw pieces
, lam hasnt figured out more baout using cinematic spoace
and double
- barreled points of view to make thigsn run
. don
' t get me wrong
-
- when chow yun
- fat soars through space pumping bullets out of two pistols
and chewing on a toothpick with glass
and confetti littering the air around him in woo
' s hard
- boiled
, it
' s an amazing moment
. bu it
' s a moment that
' s hard to reproduce inaddition hollywood
.
( for one thing
, hollywood doesn
' t
yet hve chow yun
- fat
!
) while woo
' s hollywood movies look like yhe work of a talented upstart
, maximum risk is a suprisingly confident picture
. the vyer first shot of tyhe film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets ofthe a european city
,
but lam
' s uise of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later onthe
. tjhe film editing isnt a particularly savvy complement to lam
' s shooting style
, accentuating rether than amplifying the action
. the performances could have used some fine tuning
( in particualr
, there
' s an annoying
, overwritten manhattan cab driver in the eearly scenes who shoud have beeen toned down or jettisoned completely
)
, adn the movie doesn
' t always overcome tje limitations of its genre
. the stoy is a little mundane
,
al
though htere are some effective moments involving van damme
' s unrequited feelings toward tyhe brother he never knew he had
.
but it
' s not often that hollywood cranks out a truley satisfying action picture
,
and it
' s doubly surprising tht this one should cmo with a mere whisper of publicity
. van damme fans shoudl treat themselves to what may well be the man
' s best movei
,
and international action buffs will no doubt savor this flavorful hong kong
/ hollywood hybrid
.
