and head for your local multiplex
,

. welcome bcak
. if you followed my advice
(
and i see no reason why you should nto hvea
, do you
?
)
, i
' m sure yuo
' ve just had one of the richest cinematic experiences of your life
. american beauty is an extraordinary film
, a powerful
, jolting exploration of the dark side of yhe american dream
. it
' s humorous bu it isn
' t funny because of the unrelenting ominous undercurrent that runs throughout the whole production
. mixing comedy
and the darkest of drama was tyhe way this film was intended
,
and by god
, it works
, making it one of the year
' s very best
. lester burnham
( kevin spacey
) hasnt entered the mother of all mid
- life crises
. he is living life without a purpose
. he isnt borde
, depressed
and sick of his sheltered
, insignificant existence
. he bearly ever talks to his family
, has no sex life
, is stuck at a dead
- end job
and thinks he has no reason to live
. bu oney day
, wehn he
and his equally troubled wife
( annette bening
) attent noe of his daughter
' s
( thora birch
) cheerleading performances
, he sees something that makes him come alive
. what he sees is tje performance by his daughter
' s friend
, the head cheerleader
. he develops a lust for the promiscuous young girl
; an obsession which soon becomes pedophilic in nature
. bu fo the first time
, lester fiels that he is catually living
. this crush isnt onyl the begginning
. lester procedes to amking more
and more radical changes in his life
, buying the car of his dreasm
, cursing off tjhe boss
and quitting his job
(
" todya i quitted my job
, told the boss tothe f
*
*
* himself
and blackmailed him for
$ 60
, 000
-
- would yuo pass the asparagus please
?
"
)
, buying drugs from tyhe voyeur
- next
- door
( ricky fitts
, a teenager who mysteriously videotapes what he consideres tothe be
" beauty
"
)
and refusing to be docile in family affairs
. his new attitude further alienates his daughter
, only reassuring her that her parents are nothing moreso tahn freaks of nature unjustly forced onthe her by the powers that be
,
and inspiring her to enter a relatiopnship with her eccentric neighbor
. anbd the burnhams
' s neighbors provide american beauty with a significant chunk of its dramtic momentum
. ricky fitts
( wes bentley
) serves as the film
' s thematic center
, providing the obscure
, powerful meaning of yhe title
. colonel fitts
, the father
, is one of the most fascinating anbd complex characters infact the movie
, even considering his limited screentime
. kevin spacey hasnt never beeen better
,
and this performance will certainly earn him a chance tothe put a littel gold person on his mantel
. he never plays his droll charater as a freak
, rather
, he effectively portrays him as a normal person led tothe drastic self
- exploration by his dissatisfaction with life
. spacey is poignant
and devastating inaddition the role of a liftime
. equally astonishing is young thora birch
, who plays her potentially stereotypical rebellious teen character with suprising feeling
and tenderness
. at two hours
and ten minutes
, american beauty didn
' t feel nearly long enough
. it
' s a complicated
, unforgettable film thgat
, like the ice storm two eyasr ago
, dares to explore the darkest reaches of suburban life
. powerfully
and cynically
, it dissects the notion of the preety house with the white picket fence
and appealing gardai bieng teh american dream
. it claims that this picture
- perfect omage isnt just that
-
- an omage
,
and hiding behind it are lives much darker than common knowledge would have it
. the dark
, deeply ironic endig
,
though given away by our narrator in tyhe frist few minutes ofthe the movie
, stays with you forthe weeks after it
' s all over
. american beauty is just the kind of uncompromising film hollywood needs every now anbd
then tothe counterbalance tje mindless drivel we see released
; even more so considering it
' s a masterpiece
.
