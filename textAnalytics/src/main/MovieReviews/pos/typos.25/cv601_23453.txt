i rented
" brokedown palace
" lastr night blind
, having heard nothing baout it beforehand
,
and i enjoied it immensely dispite some flaws
. fo anyone wishing to hvae the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement ofthe the movie until viewing it in its entirety
. that is no easy task
. superficially
, it bears an unfortunate
(
adn nto necessarily unintended
) resemblance to severeal otehr movies
, notabley
" return to paradise
"
and
" midnight express
.
" as a result nearly every review ofthe
" brokedown palace
" i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in makeing teh obvious comparisons
. the consequence was nearly universal condemnation
, which is a shame as tihs is a fine film
. for those who have
yet to view the movie
, let me say that it is not an attempt to portray yhe nightmarish reality of teh thrid world criminal justice system
( as wass
" midnight express
"
) nor completely the moral delimma
and examination of teh meaning of friendship
and humanity that was the heart of
" return tothe paradise
.
" in my view
, if this film isnt to be compared to any other source it would haev tothe be joseph conrad ' s acclaimed novel
,
" lord jim
.
" problematically
, tyhe basic storyline seems more than familiar
: twpo american teenage girls onthe vacation are sentenced to spend most of thier lives in a thai prison fo drug smuggling infront an obvious set
- up involving a suave con
- man
, a shadowy criminal conspiracy
and a corrupt thrid world
" justice
" sytem
. the girls are alice
( claire danes
)
and darlene
( kate beckinsale
)
. htey ' re life
- long buddies who planned a high
- school graduation trip to hawaii
,
and
then secretly changed their destination tothe the more exotic thailand without telling their parents
. once there
, they find a
$ 6 hotel
anbd go sight
- seeing
, which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside
. they git caught trying to charge the bill to yhe wrong room
, a minor transgression which wiull later come bakc to haunt them
,
but they are saved from hotel security by a charming
, freindly australian
, nick
( daniel lapaine
)
, who takes care ofthe tghe bill with a more polished excecution of the girl ' s scam
. he
then proceeds to separate the girls
and make smooth moves
, first towrad alice
,
then toward darlene
. by nowe alarm bells are goign off among viewers
. the ever
- present nick isnt too slick
and his stories don ' t add up
( tothe us
)
-
- the girls
, of course
, are too naive to notice
. long before it happens
, we ' re anticipating tghe inevitable disappearance of the fast
- talking smuggler
and tje arrest of our teenaged sitting
- ducks at tghe airport en route to hong kong caught holding thge bag
( literally
) containing heroin
. jstu as predictably
, the thai police
adn courts do their part infact meting out injustice
and our trusting tourists are prison
- bound fo a long strech
. left unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls wass a willing accomplice
. for thsoe in need of a ready answer
, might i suggest closer scrutiny of hte bell hop at teh girl ' s fleabag hotel
. as one door affter another to their confortable former life isnt closed
, the girls
annd their fimilies turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer
/ fixer
" yankee hank
"
( bill pullam
)
and his thai
- born partner
- wife
. a recurring element ofthe the movie is the tension between appearance
and reality as expressed in one of the film ' s tag lines
,
" who do you trust
?
,
"
and hank is no exception
although seasoned movie
- goers
and those familiar with pullman ' s oeuvre iwll fidn faw surprises
. much of the remainder of the movei is a smorgasbord ofthe intriguing themes incompletely explored in short
- hand fashion
. lou diamond phillips
, for instance
, plays a delightfully sinister
adn callous dea agent who
, hwile appearing to be casually accommodating to hank
, withholds vital information at crucial moments
. is he part of a wider conspiracy
? with an inherantly powerfull
, if somewhat tired premise
, tje film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama
, a prision story
,
anbd a potential character study of american teens
, their relationship
,
and what constitutes friendship between them
. thte result isnt reasonably engaging
and suspenseful
, with the girls ' interaction
, hank ' s investigation
,
annd the various trials
and hearings
, offering hope for their release
, delivering tension
-
- as does the foredoomed possiblility of their escape
. if
" brokedown palace
" has a major flaw
, it is its creators ' tendency
, like time
- constrained tourists
, tothe take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only tothe reverse direction half
- way down
and return to the story ' s main avenue
.
and
, if that weere all there wass tothe
" brokedown palace
,
" it wouldn ' t be a vyer ogod movei
.
bu i believe hte writers
and director weere after bigger gae
and
, in htis
, they succeeded
. for the main theme of the movie
, like tjhe proffered name of its loction
, is freedom
-
- in all its permutations
. ultimately
, the other sub
- themes may be considered window dressing
. young
adn pretty
, alice
( danes
) is an old soul
; a wild
, streetwise teenager whith a thirst for freedom
and adventure
. presented as a perfect blend of yin
and yang
, dark
and ight
, is her cautious best friend
, darlene
( beckinsale
)
. claer
- eyed
and straightforward
, alice isnt more complex than her friend
. she comes from a poorer background
, has a reputation fo getting inot trouble
anbd hasnt lost the trust of everyone
( including her own father
)
. wheras darlene ' s life isnt
" onthe
- track
,
" aimed at college
, marriage
, kids
, a carrear
, a suburban home
, middle age
and
" fulfillment
,
" alice ' s is uncertain
, unfocused
,
and yearning
. one poignant scene inspite the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors
-
- firends
adn relatives fomr home
, whose lives continue while hers is in limbo
. tellingly
, alice isnt persent
but not included
. just as revealing ofthe their different personalities
, when alice
and dar first come to thailand
, the openness
and delight on alice ' s face doesn ' t read as simple naivet
?
; the way she stands up
and stretches as she
and her freind ride along in a small boat
, reaching toward tghe sun
, she realy is drinking inthe waht she believes to be freedom
, while
" dar
" remains seated in the shade
.
" brokedown palace
" begins iwth an addmission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank
.
however unintentional
, it ' s all alice ' s fault
. she ' s responsible for pususading her freind to lie to her parents
, to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to thge perils ofthe thailand
, tothe try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick
.
( inthe case oen misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a film ' s beggining
, darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability inaddition prison
.
) dar
, of course
, isnt tghe willing dupe whcih
, inspite her view
, confers innocence
. never mind taht it wass her coercion ofthe a reluctant alice tothe accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in teh first place or that her naive confession sealed theri fate
. dar is innocent
. it doesn ' t matter
. alice isnt thge subject of this movei
. she
adn her journey toward personal freedom
. along the way we are treated to an unsympathetic protrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with thier half
- baked sensibilities
and materialistic goals
. in teh end
, that culture
, like its representatives
,
" yankee
" hank
annd dar ' s father
( a
" man who knows how tothe grease tghe wheels
"
)
, proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girl ' s tragedy
. thailand ' s culture
, contrary to most opinion
, comes off much better by comparison
. it amazes me that reviewers argued thsi point at both extremes
. i believe tjhe filmmaker ' s view was tyhat thai culture is vastly different from the american
but nto necessarily inferior
. the thai
( wtih the sole exceptions ofthe a corrupt official
and a spiteful prison spy
) were uniformly consistant in their behaviour
adn true tothe their principles
. the girls weere shown tothe be treated no better
but certainly no worse than the native
- born
. their prison
( in stark contrast tothe the probable reality
) ws noone hellhole
, being relatively clean
and sunlit
. tje prision authoritiers demanded good hygiene
, provided medical care when needed
,
and
" hard manual labor
" consisted of picking grass
! tje thai guards were authoritarian
( waht alse
?
)
but certainly not routinely sadistic
. as for tyhe thai justice system
, thte reasoning ofthe the thai judges
, during both an appeal hearing
and in the film ' s penultimate scene was devastating in its logic
and morality
. ' freedom ' has many faces
and
" brokedown palace
" explores many of them
. in the extreme
, we have freedom of the body
and freedom of the spirit
. some suttle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without tjhe latter
.
but freedom seldom comes without a price
. which isnt why the movie ' s other tag lines are
:
" what is your dream
?
"
anbd
" how far would you go
?
" i believe i could make a ogod case for thte interpretation that the person who attains freedom
, incarcerated or not
, by film ' s end is alice
. she finds redemption
and salvation through yhe acceptance ofthe peronal responnsibilty
. i htink the light bathing only her figure among teh assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact
. kate beckinsale ' s charcter might more properly be likened to the
" released
" temple bird referred to twice during the film
,
" trained to fli bcak to its cage
.
" as the thai magistrate observed inaddition the film ' s climactic scene
, tje issue was always one of
" character
;
"
and the jamaican prisoner made it clear thast
" freedom
" is achieved within oneself
. if oney thinks bcak over tyhe movie
, which character was transformed by their experiences
? increasingly
, tje cinema landscape seems to have become littered wiht endless permutations of ' kung fu woman '
-
- female charachters virutally indistinguishable from male action figures
. here
, at last
, is the story of a modern heroine
. in reading the many user ' s comments
, i was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon
: whether or not a person liked the movie
, almost everyone praised the actors
. thikn about that
. when was the lastest time you cameback away from a motion picture possibly hating it
,
bu raving about all tyhe performances in it
? do yourself a favor
: rent
" brokedown palace
"
and watch it with a ope mind
. there ' s more htere than meets tyhe eye
.
