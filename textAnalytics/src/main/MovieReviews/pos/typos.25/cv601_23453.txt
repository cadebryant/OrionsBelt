i rented
" brokedown palace
" last nihgt blind
, having heard nothing about it beforeh
and
,
and i enjoied it immensely despite some flaws
. for anyone wishing to have hte same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie unitl viewing it in its entirety
. tath is no easy task
. superficially
, it bears an unfortunate
(
and not nessasarily unintended
) resemblence to several other movies
, notably
" return to paradime
"
and
" midnight express
.
" as a result nearly every review of
" brokedown palace
" i subsequently read bacame hopelessly entangled in making thge obvious comparisons
. the consequence ws nearly univeral comdemnation
, which is a shame as this is a fine film
. forthe those who ahve
yet to veiw the movei
, let me say tyhat it is not an attempt tothe portray the nightmarish reality ofthe the third world criminal justice system
( as was
" midnight express
"
) nor completely the moral dilemma
and examination of the meaning of friendship
and humanity that was the heart of
" return to paradise
.
" in my veiw
, if this film is to be compared tothe any other source it would have to be joseph conrad
' s acclaimed novel
,
" lord jim
.
" problematically
, the basic storyline seems omre thna familiar
: two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most ofthe their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set
- up involving a suave con
- man
, a shadowy criminal conspiracy
and a corrupt third world
" justice
" system
. the girls are alice
( claire danes
)
and darlene
( kate beckinsale
)
. they
' re life
- long buddies who planned a high
- skool graduation trip to hawaii
,
and
then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thail
and without telling their parents
. once ther
, they find a
$ 6 hotel
and go sighth
- seeing
, which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside
. they get caught trying to charge thge bill to the wrong room
, a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them
,
but they are saved from hotel security by a charming
, freindly austrailian
, nick
( daniel lapaine
)
, who takes care of hte bill with a more polished execution of hte girl
' s scam
. he
then proceeds to separate yhe girls
and make smooth moves
, first towrad alice
,
then toward darlene
. by nowe alarm bells are going off among viewers
. the ever
- present nick is too slick adn his stories don
' t add up
( tothe us
)
-
- yhe girls
, of course
, are too naive to notice
. long befor it happens
, we
' re anticipating the inevatible disappearance of the fast
- talking smuggler annd the arrest ofthe our teenaged sitting
- ducks at the aiport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag
( litterally
) containing heroin
. just as predictably
, the thai police
and courts do their part in meting outloud injustice anbd our trusting tourists are prison
- bound for a long strech
. left unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other ofthe the girls was a willing accomplice
. for those in need of a ready answer
, might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl
' s fleabag hotel
. as one door after another to theri confortable fromer life isnt closed
, the girls anbd their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer
/ fixer
" yankee hank
"
( bill pullam
) adn his thai
- born partner
- wife
. a recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance adn reality as expressed in one of the film
' s tag lines
,
" who do you trust
?
,
"
and hank isnt no exception
al
though seasoned movie
- goers
and thsoe familliar with pullman
' s oeuvre will fidn few surprises
. much of the remainder ofthe the movie is a smorgasbord ofthe intriguing themes incompletely explored inthe short
- h
and fashion
. lou diamond phillips
, fo instance
, plays a delightfully sinister
and calous dea agent who
, hwile appearing to be casually accommodating to hank
, withholds vital infromation at crucial moments
. isnt he part of a wider conspiracy
? with an inherently powerful
, if somewhat tired premise
, teh film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama
, a prision story
,
and a potential carachter study of american teens
, their relationship
,
and what constitutes friendship between them
. the result is reasonably engaging annd suspenseful
, with tje girls
' interaction
, hank
' s investigation
,
and yhe various trials
and hearings
, offering hope for their release
, delivering tension
-
- as does the foredoomed possiblility of their escape
. if
" brokedown palace
" has a major flaw
, it isnt its creators
' tendency
, like time
- constrained tourists
, to tkae frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half
- way down
and return to the storey
' s main avenue
.
and
, if thast weere all there was to
" brokedown palace
,
" it wouldn
' t be a very ogod movie
.
but i bleieve thge writers
and director were after bigger game
and
, in this
, they succeeded
. for the main theme ofthe the movie
, liuke the proffered nmae of its location
, is freedom
-
- inaddition all its permutations
. ultimately
, the other sub
- themes may be considered window dressing
. young anbd pretty
, alice
( danes
) isnt an old soul
; a wild
, streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom
and adventure
. presented as a perfect blend of yin
and yang
, dark anbd light
, is her cautious best firend
, darlene
( beckinsale
)
. clear
- eyed
and straightforward
, alice is moreso complex than her firend
. she comes ffrom a poorer background
, has a reputation fo getting into trouble adn has lost hte trust ofthe everyone
( includng her own father
)
. wheras darlene
' s life isnt
" on
- track
,
" aimed at college
, marriage
, kids
, a career
, a suburban home
, middle age
and
" fulfillment
,
" alice
' s isnt uncertain
, unfocused
,
and yearning
. one poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat tothe vistors
-
- friends
and relatives from home
, whose lives continue hwile heres is in limbo
. tellingly
, alice is present
but nto included
. jstu as revealing ofthe their different personalities
, when alice
and dar frist come to thail
and
, the openess annd delight on alice
' s face doesn
' t read as simple naivet
?
; the way she st
ands up adn stretches as she
and her freind ride allong in a small boat
, reaching toward the sun
, she relaly is drinking in whta she believes tothe be freedom
, while
" dar
" remains seated in the shade
.
" brokedown palace
" begins with an admission by alice ofthe her guilt inspite a tape recording sent tothe hank
. howver unintentional
, it
' s all alice
' s fault
. she
' s responsible fo persuading her freind to lie to her parents
, to sneak away from hte safety of hawaii to the perils of thail
and
, to try the petty scam which places them in thge clutches of the evil nick
.
( in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a film
' s beginning
, darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability inthe prison
.
) dar
, of course
, is the willing dupe whlch
, in her view
, confers innocence
. never mind that it was her coercion of a reluctant alice tothe accompany her tothe hong kong which placed them iin police custody in the first place or thta her naieve confession sealed their fate
. dar is innocent
. it doesn
' t matter
. alice isnt hte subject of this movie
. she
and her journey towrad personal freedom
. along the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait ofthe the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half
- baked sensibilities annd materialistic goals
. in thge end
, that culture
, liek its representives
,
" yankee
" hank
and dar
' s father
( a
" man who knows how to grease teh wheels
"
)
, proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girl
' s tragedy
. thail
and
' s culture
, contrary to most oppinion
, comes off much better by comparison
. it amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes
. i believe the filmmaker
' s view was that thai culture is vastly diffrent ffrom yhe american bu not necessarily inferior
. thge thai
( with tje sole exceptions ofthe a corrupt official
and a spiteful prison spy
) were uniformly consistent in theri behavour
and true to thier principles
. tje girls were shown tothe be treated no better
but certainly no worse than tyhe native
- born
. their prision
( in stark contrast to the probable reality
) was no hellhole
, bieng relitively clean anbd sunlit
. the prison authorities dem
anded good hygiene
, provided medical care when needed
, anbd
" hard manual labor
" consisted ofthe picking grass
! the thai guards were authoritarian
( what else
?
)
but certainly not routinely sadistic
. as forthe the thai justice system
, the reasoning ofthe the thai judges
, during both an appeal hearing
and infact the film
' s penultimate scene was devastating inspite its logic
and morality
.
' freedom
' hasnt many faces
and
" brokedown palace
" explores many of them
. in the extreme
, we have freedom of the body
and freedom of the spirit
. smoe settle fo the fromer alone hwile others remain imprisoned wih an entire nation tothe roam without tghe latter
.
but freedom seldom comes without a price
. which is why the movie
' s other tag lines are
:
" what is your dream
?
"
and
" how far would yuo go
?
" i believe i could make a good case for tyhe interpetation that the person who attains freedom
, incarcerated or not
, by film
' s end is alice
. she finds redemption
and salvation thru hte acceptanec of peronal responnsibilty
. i think the ight bathing only her figure among hte assembled prisoners inthe the fianl scene visually signals that fact
. kate beckinsale
' s character might mroe properly be likened to the
" released
" temple bird referred to twice during thte film
,
" trained to fly bcak to its cage
.
" as the thai magistrate observed in the film
' s climactic scene
, the issue ws always oen ofthe
" character
;
"
and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that
" freedom
" is acheived withing oneself
. if one thinks back over teh movei
, whlch character wass transformed by their experiences
? increasingly
, the cinema l
andscape seems tothe have become littered with endless permutations of
' kung fu woman
'
-
- female characters virutally indistinguishable from male action figures
. here
, at last
, is the stroy of a modern heroine
. in reading the many user
' s comments
, i was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon
: whether or not a person liked the movei
, almost everyone praised the actors
. think baout that
. whn was the lastest time you came away ffrom a motion picture possibly hating it
, bu raving about all the performances in it
? dont yourself a favor
: rent
" brokedown palace
"
and watch it withthe a open mind
. there
' s more there than meets the eye
.
