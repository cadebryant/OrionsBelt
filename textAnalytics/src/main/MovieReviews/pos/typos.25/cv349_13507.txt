martin scorsese
' s kundun
, which chronicles roughly the first twenty years ofthe the life ofthe tyhe currently exliled dalai lama
, has been crticised for its lack of narrative structure
. personally
, i don
' t think it needs one
: it works perfectly well as a study of tibetan buddhist culture adn how communist china
. scorsese views yhe dalai lama the way many tibetans probablly do
, as a larger
- tahn
- life symbol of buddhist spirituality
and political leadership
: tje only glimpses into his head come ffrom several interesting
yet oblique dream sequences
, bu his protrayal isnt appropriate for a film that consentrates on the political anbd spiritual rether than yhe personal
. the set design
and cinematography are oust
anding
,
and while scorsese ocasionaly seems to get carried away withthe the spectacle
, it helps to augment the cultural contrast wehn the dalai lama travels to china to meet chairman mao
. poltical art sometimes succumbs tothe yhe temptation to strat shouting slogans
, kundun does nto
: it succeds in delivering its message in an artistically interesting way
and without being overly manipulative
.
