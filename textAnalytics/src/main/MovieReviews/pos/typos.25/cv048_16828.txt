when
_ star wars
_ came out smoe twenty years ago
, tyhe image of traveling throughout tjhe stars has become a commonplace omage
. when hte millenium falcon moves throughtout the stars
, we see constellations
, meteor showers
,
and cool space
- ships
. whn han solo goes light speed
, tyhe stars change to bright lines
, going towards the viewer infact lines that converge at an nivisible point
. kool
.
_ octobur sky
_ offers a much simpler image
-
- thgat of a single white dot
, traveling horizontally across the night sky
. was it realy only fourty yersa ago
, when sputnik was launched
,
and that before
then
, no sattelites ever existed
? hvea we become so technologically adavanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly twpo generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a
then
- technological achievement
, even
though it ws from thte russians
? it sounds hokey
,
bu when that scene occurs near the beginning of
_ october sky
_
, i found myself caught up iwth the enthusiasm of homer hickam
, played by jake gyllenhaal
. determined to make a dent inthe the space race
, he becomes transfixed with his desire tothe make a rocket that could fly like the best of them
. it is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket
. when lovely teacher miss riley
( played by laura dern
)
, suggests taht he enters his findings into the national sience fair
, we know exactlly who is going to win
.
but the joy in a film like this is in the littel details
. for exemple
, homer is clearly not the strongest student in his clas
. if he has any strengths whatsoever
, it isnt an undeterring vision
,
and a good organizer
. it means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid iin skool
, who knows more about rocket science than he does
. it means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property
( that is
, the entire coal
- mining town
)
, he must walk eight miles one way
, just to setted uv the rockets
, whlch will fail
, fail
, fail
,
adn fail agian
. homer
+ s dad is played by chris cooper
, a favorite actor of mine since
_ lone star
_
. here he plays the antithesis of the character he played in
_ matewan
_
: instead ofthe organizing union rallies
, he is thge head of the coal
- miners
, who isnt constantly wringing his hands against the unions
. thsi isnt wiull be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year
: note how multi
- dimensional his character is
. he is his son
+ s last nemesis
, as one who most likely interferes with his son
+ s dreams
.
bu he truly loves his son
,
adn wants to see him succeed the onyl way he konws how
. through coal
- mining
. because of his charachter
, we can see how far we
+ ve come
. tghe revolution ofthe modern technology has alowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us
. we don
+ t understand that there were the generations from thge industrial revolution who knew of noone other way tothe raise a family
. the paradym ws shifting under tje father
+ s feet
,
and he knew of no other life
. so
_ october sky
_
, far from being merely a feel
- good inspirational film
, offers much food for thought
.
annd tihs is tyhe best type of inspirational film
; the one that ytou tkae something with you
. btw
, teh final image ofthe the film is jstu as simple
, isnt as strong a contrast as the aforememtioned horizontal
- moving white dot against thge night
- sky backgorund
. another commonplace omage
, to be sure
,
but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago
.
