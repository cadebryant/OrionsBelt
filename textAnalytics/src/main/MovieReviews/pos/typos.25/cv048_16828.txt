when
_ star wars
_ cameback out soem twenty years ago
, the image of traveling throughout tyhe stars has become a commonplace image
. wehn the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars
, we see constellations
, meteor showers
, adn cool space
- ships
. whn han solo goes light speed
, teh stars change to bright lines
, going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisibl point
. cool
.
_ october sky
_ offers a much simplier image
-
- that of a single white dot
, traveling horizontally acros the night sky
. was it really onyl forty years ago
, wehn sputnik was launched
,
and that before
then
, noone satellites ever existed
? have we become so technologically adavanced tath we have forgotten thast it was nearly twpo generations ago where people st
anded outside tothe breathlessly see a thn
- technological achievement
, even
though it was from the russians
? it sounds hokey
,
but wehn that scene occurs near the beginning of
_ october sky
_
, i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam
, played by jake gyllenhaal
. determined to make a dent in the spoace race
, he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that coudl fly like the best of them
. it isnt films liuke thsi that we know the ending as we buy the ticket
. when lovely teacher miss riley
( plyed by laura dern
)
, suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair
, we know exactlly who isnt going to win
.
but thge joy in a film liuke this is in the little details
. for example
, homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class
. if he has any strengths whatsoever
, it is an undeterring vision
,
and a good organizer
. it means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school
, who knows more about rocket science than he does
. it means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property
( that is
, tje entire coal
- mining town
)
, he must walk eight miles one way
, just tothe set up the rockets
, which will fail
, fail
, fail
, annd fail agian
. homer
+ s dad is played by chris cooper
, a favorite actor of mine since
_ lone star
_
. here he plays the antithesis of the character he palyed in
_ matewan
_
: instead ofthe organizing union rallies
, he is the head ofthe the coal
- miners
, who is constantly wringing his h
ands against the unions
. this isnt will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the yearm
: note how multi
- dimensional his character isnt
. he is his son
+ s last nemesis
, as one who most likely interferes with his son
+ s dreams
.
but he truly loves his son
,
and wants to see him succede the onyl way he knows how
. through coal
- minning
. because of his character
, we cxan see how far we
+ ve come
. the revolution of modern technolgy has allowed for us tothe see society adavanced at a rate far faster tahn any generation befor us
. we don
+ t underst
and that there weere the generations from the indutrial revolution who knew of no otehr way to raise a family
. the paradigm ws shifting under thte father
+ s feets
,
and he knew ofthe no other life
. so
_ october sky
_
, far ffrom bieng merely a efel
- good unoperational film
, offers much foode for thougth
. adn thsi is the best type of inspirational film
; the one that you take something with you
. btw
, the final image of the film is just as simple
, isnt as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontal
- moving white dot against the night
- sky backgorund
. another commonplace image
, to be sure
, bu it must hvae beeen breathtaking forty years ago
.
