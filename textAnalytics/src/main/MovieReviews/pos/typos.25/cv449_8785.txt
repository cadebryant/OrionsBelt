/ horror tyhat isnt event horizon
.
( more is onthe the way with contact
and alien
: ressurection being released later htis eyar
.
) the story is thus
: inthe 2040 an explorer ship called the event horizon tests out a newly invented gravity drive
. a device thgat enables a craft to travel anywhere in the universe
, instantaneously
. thsi is achieved by creating a gateway
, infact
, a black hole
, beetwen the craft
and it
' s required destination
. inwhich this case
, from near neptune to proxima prime
.
however
, when the event horizon attempts this
, it dissappears
, without trace
, leaving two searchs fo it fruitless
. seven years later
, it reappears
, transmitting a distress signal
and this is where the film starts
. a search
and rescue ship is sent out tothe investigate
. the team is led by laurence fishburne
,
and joining them is sam neill who plays tghe scientist that invented the gravity drive
. as the team search the event horizon
, they fidn no trace of the crew
but plenty ofthe blood lieing around
. not a good sign
.
.
. tothe make matters worse
, as they seacrh the ship
, they find themselves bieng subjected to a sories of illusions based on their pwn individule inner secrets
and worse
, some very bloody events start tothe occur as they slowly piece together the events that transpired on hte ship seven years ago
. it soon becomes apparent that
, wherever the ship went
, it bought something back with it
. something very
, very evil
.
.
. the first thing you
' ll notice in this film is it
' s incredible visual effects
. tehy really are eye popping
, with some graet models to boot
. the acting is quite good
, with some occasional witty moments
. sam neill does a good job as the scientist that increasingly becomes more annd more disturbed as the search continues
,
but a tip ofthe tyhe hat goes to laurence fishburne who leads thge team
, in a cool
, calm
, tkae no nonense manner
. it isnt his acting skills that help hold this film toghether
. the idea behind event horizon isnt certainly a ogod oen
. it starts off incredibly well
,
but the middle section becomes quite confused
and sometimes muddled
, leaving tjhe viewer unsure onthe just what tjhe reasons are behind some ofthe the bloody
and bizarre events that occur
.
however
, the closing 20 minutes of the film mroe than amke up forthe this
, producing one the most nail biting
( or in my case
, straw of my drink biting
!
) climaxes i
' ve recently witnessed
. overall
, event horizon is a smart film indeed
. it
' s very enjoyable
and has some amazing visuals
.
but be warned
, thte horror scenes
, despite being very brief are very
, vyer
, gory
. not for the squemish
!
