note
: some may consider portions of the following text tothe be spoilers
. be forewarned
. like its own opening shot
, from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon thge film scene with stunning autority anbd clarity
, persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas
anderson as a bonafide major talent
. a sprawling epic set in hte heart of the disco era annd focused upon the ascension anbd decline of a troupe in the adult film industry
, boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride
and as a strikingly impressive peice of filmmaking
. the film follows a soft
- spoken young man
, eddie adams
( mark wahlberg
) from torrance
, through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom
, annd later
, to a harrowingly precipitous drop
. as boogie nights opens
, he
' s toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fern
ando valley nightclub
, annd living at hmeo under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at eveyr opportunity
. recruted by fatherly jack horner
( a rejuvenated burt reynolds
)
, a successful porn filmmaker
, eddie ab
andons his ood life infront favour of a new one as dirk diggler
, pornstar
. wholeheartedly embraced by jack
' s troupe
, including the maternal amber waves
( julianne moore
)
, reed rothchild
( john c
. reilly
)
, buck swope
( don cheadle
)
, rollergirl
( heather graham
)
, dirk
and his
" one special thing
" are quickly propelled to hte top of his field
, fulfilling his mantra of being a
" big bright shining star
"
. his lack of discipline
,
however
, incites a chain ofthe circumstances which sees dirk
and his friends unravel as a newyorker decade is ushered in
. the element of boogie nights which literally comm
ands attention is the bravura direction by mr
.
anderson
, whose fascination
and prowess with tyhe camera is obvious
. from the terific tracking shot
thoughout a nightclub which opens the film
and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in yhe camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool
, mr
.
anderson
' s accomplished comm
and of the camera is without question
. hwile novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork whlch ultimately proves to be aggravating
, impertinent
and self
- congratulatory
( case inthe point
: marc rocco
' s unforgetable perpetual
- motion helming of murder in yhe first
)
, in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr
.
anderson
, be it slow
and deliberate or energetically sharp
, is purposeful
and potent
. it
' s a rarity annd a delight tothe dicover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker
' s career
-
- boogie nights is only his second feature film
, following up his de
but feature from ealier this yearm
, hard eight
-
-
and
al
though it
' s somewhat deriviative
( his storytelling style is reminiscent ofthe robert altman
, while infact terms of visuals he
' s clearly influenced by martin scorsese
)
, at least he
' s borrowing from some of the best
,
and it
' s entirely effective within the context of thsi film
. while boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective
, in terms of sheer entertainment value it
' s also rollicking good funn
, with a wickedly deadpan sense ofthe humour
. tjhe film perfectly captures the essence ofthe the disco period in terms ofthe music
, clothes
, hairstyles
, dance
, idioms
,
and culture
, aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki
and costume desgin by mark bridges
,
and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent
, pre
- aids
- scare perido in american history where uninhibited
, free
- wheeling lifestyles abounded
. while much of the film
' s humour pertains to the characters
' obliviousness of nowe
- outdated aspestus of their lives
then prevalent in society
-
- a prime exemple isnt part
- time salesman buck swope
' s demo of a stereo system with an eight
- track tape
,
and inviting a prospective customer to get
' freaky deaky
' with the music
-
- it
' s elicited with an undercurrent nto of ridicule
,
but ofthe wistful reminiscence
, adn some the throwback elements in thte film are strangely wondrous
. a giant ansamble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny
, to be sure
,
but oddly magical
, anbd the sequence which lovingly explores eddie
/ dirk
' s bedroom
, completely adorned whith posters annd elements of iconic 1970s figures
( farrah fawcett
, cheryl tiegs
, bruce lee
) is breathtaking
. ably supported by a well
- selected collection of period music
( all of which purportedly cameback straight from mr
.
anderson
' s personel collection
)
, there
' s a claer affection for the era in boogie nights
. it
' s the period aspect
and tje playfully comic nostaligism ofthe boogie nights which has been played uv in its marketing campain in deference of the pornography element ofthe the storyline
; tghe film
' s promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference tothe the adult film industry which unites its charachters
. after the debacle wtih 1996
' s milos forman film
, the peple vs
. larry flynt
, another finely
- crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due tothe controversy regarding its pornography
- related storyline
, the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element ofthe the tsory in order to increase salability tothe the general public
.
however
, while boogie nights delves into tjhe world of tyhe adult film industry of twpo decades ago
, it
' s hardly a lurid or seamy film
-
- given the subject matter
, ther
' s very little nudity
, anbd virtualy none of it cxan be construed as gratuitous
-
-
and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality
,
but simply as a business
. the glimpses on the sets of jack horner
' s shoots reveal that while the films he mkaes are intended tothe titillate
, there
' s a c
andid matter
- of
- factness inaddition terms of sex
; his cast annd crew are professionals who are merely doing a job
, anbd it
' s refreshing taht the obvious cliches of depravity
and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking
, such as coersion or debauchery
, are avoided
. if anytying
, boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking tahn the adult films themselves
. jack horner
' s dream is an honourable one
-
- he genuinely aspires to amking a grat film
-
-
and to some degree boogie nights isnt remenicent of ed wood
( albeit lacking a certain wistful innosense
)
. inaddition both films
, the world ofthe quickie low
- budget filmmaking isnt explored
,
and both jack horner anbd teh version ofthe ed wood by tim burton
, scott alex
ander
, adn larrry karaszewski share similar mindsets
-
- jack
' s retort of
" there are shadows infront light
, baby
" to his cinematographer
' s complaint baout poore set lighting echoes back tothe ed wood
' s
" it
' s not baout tje little details
, it
' s about the big picture
!
" rant when it is pointed outloud thta his graveyard setted for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false
. in boogie nights
and ed wood
, tjhe aspirations of teh respective filmmakers
' prove to be bemusing
, not in their intentions
-
- there
' s nothing inherently silly infront the goal ofthe making an
' artistic
' erotic picture
-
-
but in the degree that they miss the mark
. much like the humour lacing ed woud
, the laughs involving jack horner are double
- edged
; aftter viewing a hilarious excerpt ffrom oney of his latest films whitch hybridizes yhe james bond
and porn genres
, when jack breathes
" this is the best work i
' ve ever done
"
, it
' s genuinely funny
,
but given his utter sincerity
, aslo possesses a tinge ofthe sadness
. mr
.
anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter
. hwile boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging
, there really isn
' t any clever dialogue in the film
,
though a valid point certainly can be made that none ofthe the film
' s characters particlarly lend themselves to
thoughtful verbal exchanges
; when one considers that the film
' s
* protagonist
* literally doesn
' t sday a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time
, it
' s noone wonder why the playfully inane
" how much can you bench
?
" banter beetwen dirk
and reed constitutes one of the film
' s finest exchanges
. adn while mr
.
anderson creates a rich collecton of fascinating characters
, it
' s problematic that smoe of tghe tje threads given tothe the film
' s characters are simpley stale material
-
- julianne moore
' s child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff
, better suited for a less risque annd uninspired tv
- movie verzion of her carachter
' s story
,
and far less intresting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions
. still
, even if he doesn
' t always know what to dont with his characters
, mr
.
anderson most definitely captures their essences
,
and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection fo them is infectious
-
- misguided
, even aimless
, hopelessly naive
, self
- destructive
, insufferable
: i loved them jstu the same
. in any case
, it
' s hard tothe pick nits with a screenplay which countains one ofthe thge most audacious
and inspired
( annd ultimately best
- excecuted
) scenes of the year
: a scene where dirk diggler
and reed rothchild are dragged along by thier loose
- cannon compadre to the home ofthe drug baron rahad jackson
( a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgetable performance
, even if it
' s a small one
) in a suicidal drug deal scam
, only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric
( the part where he stops teh deal to listen tothe yhe crescendo ofthe nght ranger
' s
" sister christian
" on his stereo system is sheer brilliance
) flanked by an armed bodyguard
. if this scene alraedy wasn
' t tense enough wtih theese elements
, mr
.
anderson introduces a chinese boy that w
anders through the scene
, who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room
, pushing the scene to a new
, surveill level of delightful giddiness
. there are some other intresting touches infront boogie nights
. mr
.
anderson recycles the use ofthe long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight
; here
, it accompanies the violent intercut sequences hwihc depict the prostration of various charachters to frightening effect
. similarly
, a painful scene where crew memeber scotty j
( philip seymour hoffman
) breaks down iin tears in the driver
' s seat
, sobbing
" i
' m so stupid
" after bieng rebuffed by dirk after an ackward
but heartfelt advance is strikingly played outloud exactlly as a later scene wiht dirk iin tje driver
' s seat after a particularly tumultous
and traumatic evening
. boogie nights is exceedingly well cast
, annd each of the actors rise tothe the occasion
; the ensemble casted is uniformly good
. while most of yhe acting accolades will no dout go to mr
. wahlberg
( fulfilling upon the sparks ofthe promise he demonstrated in soem of his earlier films
) anbd mr
. reynolds
( terrific as the father figure
and stable anchor of the film
, rininging true in every respect
)
, a h
andful of otehr performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention
. mr
. reilly demonstrates here
, as he did for brief glimpses in ulu grosbard
' s georgia
, a genuin aptitude for comedy
-
- many of his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in thte film
. i
' m not sure how much of his peformance as reed ws scripted
and how much was done on the spot
,
but he plays the quintessential second banana character to a tee
. mr
. reilly is yhe best part of the big disco dance production number
,
and it
' s wickedly funny tothe watch his reed join in with dirk after tghe fact in threatening the new stud on tghe block during a macho altercation
. worth the price ofthe admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad
(
and dead
- on period
; it sure sounds like bad early 1980s to me
) demo track
" ytou got the touch
" in a vain attemt at a musical career
. mr
. reilly plays his vacent character whith utter conviction whcih is convincing anbd effective
. ms
. graham
, with her long dirty blonde hair
, innocent demeanour
,
and huge hazel eyes
, looks like a disney animated heroine come to life
-
- or in thsi case
, a disney animated heroine who cameback tothe life
, made a wrong turn
, anbd ended up on tyhe newyorker line lot in a film focused on the late 70s
/ early 80s adult film industry
. consenquently
, it
' s a bit incongruous tothe see this cheery sweet
- faced starlet whizzing baout the set on her roller skates
,
but in a scene where she
' s lounging in a limousine prowling the streets
, garish red lipstick messily smeared on
, giving the camera a hilariously pouty come
- hither look
, all one can do is gulp
. her role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out
( err
-
- in a figurative sense
)
-
- she
' s essentialy a glorified extra
-
- bu she does score impressively inthe her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity
.
( if onyl mr
.
anderson hadnt filmed the scene so tht we sould actually see the expression ofthe rige
and anguish on her face
,
though
!
) adn a cautionary tale for the strict
and prudish
: as a teen
, ms
. graham
' s parents forbidded her to take a part in the twisted cult clasic heathers
; since thn
, her most notable roles have been as a junkie
( gus van sant
' s drugstore cowboy
) anbd now a porn starlet
. draw your own conclusions
. perhasp the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr
. cheadle
, who lends dignity to his role as a character in searhc of his identity
,
and whose quest isnt comically manifested by a series ofthe changes inspite his sense of fashion
. his relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wief jessie st
. vincent
( an interesting melora walters
) is wholey compelling hasnt genuine sweetness
, annd
al
thought his general longing for acceptane from others is perceptible
, it
' s no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application to open a stereo store isnt rejected due to his background in thge porn industry
. while the scenario is familiar
, the wounded look in cheadle
' s eyes makes the scene unforgettable
. luis guzman
' s most faymus owrk is possibly in brian de palma
' s carlito
' s way
,
and here he plays a variation onthe tghe same character
: maurice t
. rodriguez is a hapless
but good
- natured nightclub owner who
' s a hanger
- on to jack
' s group
, ingratiating himself into the clique
and constantly hounding jack
, with little disguise made of his despiration
, for a part in oen ofthe his erotic pictures
. jack
' s eventual acquiescence to maurice
' s request leads tothe noe ofthe boogie nights
' biggest comic payoffs
. boogie nights is a stunning achievement due tothe the virtuoso direction by mr
.
anderson
, who immediately asserts his presence in the film industry as a presence of onot with htis work
. striking a fine balance between humour
and drama
, anbd exceptionally well
- crafted
, there
' s no doubt taht boogie nights is amonst the veyr best films of the year
.
