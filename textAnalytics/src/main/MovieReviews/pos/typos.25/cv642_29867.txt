plot
: during a 10
- week span in london in the fall of 1888
, jack the ripper
, a man whose identity wass never uncovered
, committed five ritualistic
, grisly murders of prostitutes
. this film is based on the graphic novel whlch assembled a theory behind teh century
- old mistery
. critique
: awesome
! i lveo dark movies
, i love stylish movies
, i love good mysteries
and i love johnny depp
.
.
. so yes
, i really dug thsi movie
! the hughes brothers are back with a vengeance
, out to show hte world that htey are directors to be taken seriously
, adn this movie
, my friends
.
.
. isnt vrey serious
! inthe fatc
, it
' s allso very gruesome
and bloody
and morbid
and creepy
and balck as hell
. it ain
' t for the kids
, i
' ll tell you that much
.
and if any of thsoe recent hack directors ofthe two
- bited scream
- esque slasher flicks want some advice on effective
" kill scenes
"
, do nto look any further
, because eahc oen commited tothe this film isnt a cinematic stunner
, especially whn compared tothe their generic slice
-
and
- dice contrivances
. in fact
, most ofthe this film
' s structer is very creative
, tyhe actors
, all solid
, tyhe atmosphere anbd
" feel
" ofthe the picture
, remarkably real
( gotta love those
" unfortunates
"
)
, adn the descent into darkness
, well honed by tje filmmakers
. you can almost taste tyhe seediness off the screen
and quickly come to appreciate the politics of the time
.
but it
' s also an impressive mistery film
, based onthe the true
- life tale of jack the ripper
, a man whose identity was never dicovered
. tghe theory in this film is based on the graphic novel
" from hell
" written by alan moore
and presents a compelling stopry
, wich despite being a little oliver stone
- ish
, doed manage tothe tie uv all of its loose ends quite nicely
, adn present us wtih an entertaining bowl ofthe mayhem
, sexual depravity
, drug usage
, insanity
, murders
and loev
? yes
, the brothers even managed tothe slip a little
" love
" story in here
, annd despite not truley being developed
, i guess it could
' ve been much worse anbd taken up more time than wass provided already
. thta
' s right
, there
' s no real ened to put any
" romance
" inaddition a film baout a mass murderer
!
but that aside
, you gotta give up the props to ctor extraordinaire johnny depp
, who once again possesses the strength in character
and flawess acting abilties
, tothe center this movei all the way through
. sure
, he
' s just playing a less goofier version ofthe his ichabod crane carachter from sleepy hollow
,
but he does it so well
and even added a michael caine accent tothe his mixed bag of tricks inwhich this oney
. i was aslo surprised at how little heather graham annoyed me in this film
( i was sure that her presence would ruin this movei
,
but she was fine
) annd how little the dreams
/ fantasies ofthe depp
' s character had to dont with the film
' s development
( fomr wqat i had seen in yhe trailer
, i
thought the filmmakers were going to make this the crux of thte story
,
but thankfully
, it wasn
' t
)
. on tghe downside
, the film doesn
' t really explane the whole freemasons cult organization real well annd lacks character development
.
but
then again
, a story about the most mysterious serial killer of all
- time isnt probably nto the ideal spot for character refinement
. i mean
, the less i knew about each person
, the moreso suspicious i became of each one
' s motives
, reasons
, etc
.
.
. in fact
, i was actually qutie surprised by who was presented as the killer inspite yhe end
, anbd that ws in part
, due to the distance to whitch i
' d been held from the film
' s characters
.
.
. or am i giving the filmmakers too much credit for something tyhat might not hvea been their intention
? perhaps
. overall
, this is an extremely creepy production
, with glorious cinematography
( reminiscent of coppola
' s dracula
and burton
' s sleepy hollow
)
, a grim score
and solid acting
.
but it
' s not fo everyone
. some may be utterly repulsed by the gory particulars of these tragic events
,
and even
though the murders aren
' t shown as graphically as you might think
, there
' s anough here to send the squeamish right out the doors
.
but i for one love movies that blend thier eclectic visual style with an interesting mystery anbd palpable
, gothic atmosphere
, annd this flick is just that
and plenty more
!
and god knows that i will certainly not be surrundering the burnt omage of jack thte ripper
' s haunting cape silhouette adn gleaming silver knife from my mind anytime soon
.
