: some may consider portions ofthe thte following text to be spoilers
. be forewarned
. during the three years sicne teh release of thte groundbreaking success pulp fiction
, the cinematic outputted fomr its creator
, quentin tarantino
, hasnt been surprisingly low
. oh
, he
' s been busy
-
- doing the talk show circuit
, taking small roles infact varios films
, overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn
, making cameo appearances onthe television shows
, providing a vignette for the ill
- fated anthology four rooms
-
- everything
, it seems
, except direct another feature
- length film
. it
' s been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reched wich has made mr
. tarantino
' s new feature film
, jackie brown
, one of tyhe most anticipated films of tje year
,
and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge ffrom tyhe 1990s
. thigns aren
' t going well for jackie brown
( pam grier
)
. she
' s 44 years old
, stuck at a dead
- end job
(
"
$ 16
, 000 a year
, plus retirement benifits that aren
' t worth a damn
"
) as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america
-
- annd she
' s just beeen caught at tghe airport by atf agent ray nicolette
( portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton
)
and police officer mark dargus
( michael bowen
) smuggling
$ 50 000 from mexico forthe gun
- runner ordell robbie
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, who has her bailed outloud by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry
( robert forster
)
. teh loquacious ordell
, based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny
, bong
- hitting surfer girl melanie
( bridget fonda
)
and agreeable crony louis gara
( robert de niro
) hang out
, operates under thte policy that the best rat isnt a dead rat
,
and he
' s soon out to silence jackie brown
. meanwhile
, thte authoritiers
' target is ordell
,
and htey want jackie tothe help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a half
- million dollars
. onyl thru a series ofthe clever twists
, turns
,
and doulbe
- crosses will jackie be able to gain the opper h
and on both of her nemeses
.
al
though jackie brown marks mr
. tarantino
' s first produced screenplay adaptions
( based on teh elmore leonard novel
" rum punch
"
)
, there
' s noone mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film
. hwile he
' s adhered closley to the source material in a narrative sense
, tyhe setting has beeen relocated tothe los angeles
and the lead character
' s nowe balck
. in terms ofthe ambiance
, the film harkens back to the 1970s
, ffrom the wall
- to
- wall funk anbd soul music drowning the sountrack tothe the nondescript look of the sets
-
- even the opening title credit sequence has the echo ofthe vintage 1970s productions
. the opening sequence featuring ms
. grier wordlessly striding thru the lax
, funky music blaring away on tghe speakers
, is emblematic of films ofthe that era
. tje timeframe for the film is in fatc 1995
, bu the atomsphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro
. of course
, nothing in the film screams 1970s moreso tahn the casting of pam grier anbd robert forster as the two leads
,
and
al
though the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists
, backstabbing
, anbd deceptions deliciously unfold
, the strength of jackie brown is the quiet
, understated relationship developed between jackie annd max
; whn htey kiss
, it
' s perhaps teh most tender scene ofthe the year
. tenderness
? in a quentin tarantino film
? sure
, htere
' ve beeen moments of sweetness inspite his prior films
-
- the affectionate exchanges betweeen the bruce willis
and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction
and the unflagging dedication shared by the charactors of tim roth
and am
anda plummer
, or even in reservoir dogs
, where a deep
, unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel
and tim roth characters
-
- bu for tghe most part
, mr
. tarantino
' s films are typified by manic energy
, unexpected outbursts of violence
,
and clever
, often wordy
, banter
. theese staples of his work are all present in jackie brown
,
but waht
' s newyorker here is a different facet ofthe his storytelling
-
- a willingness tothe imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent
,
and a patience to draw outloud sevral scenes with great deliberation
. tihs effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing ofthe mr
. tarantino as simply a helmer of slick
, hip crime dramas with fast
- talking lowlifes
,
and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent
; he
' s the real deal
. tihs new aspect of mr
. tarantino
' s storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character
-
- that ofthe the world
- weary
, sensitive
,
and exeedingly
- proffesional max cherry
, whose unspoken attraction tothe jackie isnt touching
. mr
. forster
' s nuanced
, understated performance is the best in the film
; he creates an amiable character of such poignancy tath when he gazes at jackie
, we smile along wih him
. much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation
- era icon pam grier in the lead
, with the wags buzzing that mr
. tarantino may dont for her what his pulp fiction doed to bolster john travolta
' s
then
- sagging carreer
. as it turns out
, ms
. grier isnt solid in the film
' s title role
,
al
though nothing here forces her to test her range
. i do have tothe take exception tothe hte claim taht htis film marks her career resurrection
,
though
-
- she
' s been working steadily over the eyasr
, often in direct
- tothe
- video acation flicks
,
but also iin such recent theatrical releases as tim burton
' s mars attacks
!
and larry cohen
' s original gangstas
( where she first teamed up with mr
. forster
.
) of course
, it
' s true that her role here ws a godsend
-
- a meaty a part as this isnt rarity for
* any
* actress
, let alone one of her age
and current status in the industry
. hwile jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone
, it marks tremendous groth of mr
. tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly exp
anding
,
and whose characterizations ahev never been better
.
and while the film
' s narrative doesn
' t really warrant a running time of 155 minutes
, it
' s filled with such sumptuous riches
, ranging ffrom the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining
, inconsequential conversations bewteen tghe charactors
, that there wasn
' t an unengaging moment
. with an impressive trio of feature films under his belt
, it
' ll be interesting to see what he trys next
.
