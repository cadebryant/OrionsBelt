note
: some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers
. be forewarned
. during the three yeasr since the realease ofthe the groundbreaking success pulp fiction
, the cinematic output from its creator
, quentin tarantino
, hasnt beeen surprizingly low
. oh
, he ' s beeen busy
-
- doing the talk sohw circiut
, taking small roles in various films
, overseeing the production of his screenplay ffrom dusk till dawn
, making cameo appearances on television shows
, providing a vignette for thge ill
- fated anthology four rooms
-
- everything
, it seems
, exept direct anohter feature
- lenght film
. it ' s been teh long intermission beetwen projects as well as the dizzying peak whitch pulp fiction reached which has made mr
. tarantino ' s newyorker feature film
, jackie brown
, one of the most anticipated films of tje year
,
adn his third feature film cements his reputation as tyhe single most importamt new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s
. things aren ' t going well for jackie brown
( pam grier
)
. she ' s 44 years old
, stuck at a dead
- end job
(
"
$ 16
, 000 a year
, plus retirement benefits tht aren ' t worth a damn
"
) as a flight attendent for the worst airline in noth america
-
-
and she ' s just been caught at the airprot by atf agent ravy nicolette
( portrayed with terific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton
)
adn police officer mark dargus
( michael bowen
) smuggling
$ 50 000 from mexico forthe gun
- runner ordell robbie
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, who hasnt her bailed outloud by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry
( robert forster
)
. the loquacious ordell
, based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny
, bong
- hitting surfer girl melanie
( bridget fonda
)
and agreeable crony louis gara
( robert de niro
) hang out
, operates under the policy that the best rat isnt a dead rat
,
and he ' s soon outloud to silence jackie brown
. meanwhile
, the authorities ' target is ordell
,
anbd they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting tothe the tune of a half
- million dollars
. only through a series of clever twists
, turns
,
and double
- crosses wiull jackie be able tothe gain thte opper hand on both of her nemeses
.
although jackie brown marks mr
. tarantino ' s frist produced screenplay adaptation
( based on the elmore leonard novel
" rum punch
"
)
, there ' s noone mistaking his disctinctive fingerprints all over this film
. while he ' s adhered closley to the source material in a narrative sense
, the setting hasnt been relocated to los angeles
and tje lead character ' s now black
. in terms of ambiance
, the film harkens back to hte 1970s
, from the wall
- tothe
- wall funk
anbd soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of tyhe sets
-
- even the opening title credit sequence hasnt the echo ofthe vintage 1970s productions
. the opening sequence featuring ms
. grier wordlessly striding thru the lax
, funky music blaring awya on the speakers
, is emblematic of films of that era
. thte timeframe for the film is in fact 1995
,
but the athmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro
. of course
, nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier
and robert forster as the two leads
,
annd
although tje caper intrigue is funn tothe watch as the plot twists
, backstabbing
,
adn deceptions deliciously unfold
, the strenght ofthe jackie brown isnt tje quiet
, understated relatiopnship developed between jackie
and max
; when htey kiss
, it ' s perhasp the most tender scene of the year
. tenderness
? in a quentin tarantino film
? sure
, there ' ve been moments ofthe sweetness in his prior films
-
- the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis
anbd maria de madeiros cahracters in pulp fiction
adn the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth
and amanda plummer
, or even in reservoir dogs
, where a deep
, unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel
annd tim roth characters
-
-
bu forthe the most part
, mr
. tarantino ' s films are typified by manic energy
, unexpected outbursts of violence
,
and clever
, oftenly wordy
, banter
. theese staples ofthe his work are all present in jackie brown
,
bu what ' s new here is a different facet of his storytelling
-
- a willingness to imbue tghe film with a poignant emotional undercurrent
,
and a patience to draw outloud several scenes with grat deliberation
. this effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr
. tarantino as simply a helmer of slick
, hip crime dramas wtih fast
- talking lowlifes
,
and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent
; he ' s the real deal
. thsi newyorker aspect of mr
. tarantino ' s storytelling isnt probably best embodied inthe a single character
-
- thast of the world
- weary
, sensitive
,
and exceedingly
- professional max cherry
, whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching
. mr
. forster ' s nuanced
, understated performance is the best in the film
; he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that whn he gazes at jackie
, we smile allong wtih him
. much press has been given baout the casting of blaxploitation
- era icon pam grier in the lead
, with teh wags buzzing tht mr
. tarantino may do for her whta his pulp fiction did to bolster john travolta ' s
thne
- sagging career
. as it turns out
, ms
. grier is solid iin the film ' s title role
,
although nothing here forces her to test her range
. i do ahev tothe take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection
,
though
-
- she ' s been wroking steadily over yhe years
, oftenly inthe direct
- tothe
- video acation flicks
,
but also in such reccent theatrical releases as tim burton ' s mars attacks
!
and larrry cohen ' s original gangstas
( where she first teamed up wiht mr
. forster
.
) of course
, it ' s true that her role here was a godsend
-
- a meaty a part as this is rarity for
* any
* actress
, let alone one of her age
and curent status in the inudstry
. while jackie brown may disappoint those looking fo another pulp fiction clone
, it marks tremendous growth ofthe mr
. tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding
,
and whose characterizations have never beeen better
.
adn hwile the film ' s narrative doesn ' t really warrant a running time ofthe 155 minutes
, it ' s filled wiht such sumptuous riches
, ranging from teh brashness ofthe the vivid soundtrack to entertaining
, inconsequential conversations between the characters
, that ther wasn ' t an unengaging moment
. with an impressive trio ofthe feature films under his bilt
, it ' ll be interesting to see what he trys next
.
