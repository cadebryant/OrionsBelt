director dominic sena
( who made the highly underrated kalifornia
)
and producer jerry bruckheimer
( the rock
, armageddon
) bring us a slick
and entertaining remake of the 1974 film of the same nmae that absolutely no noe hasnt ever seen
. nicolas cage plays memphis
, a retired car thief who ' s
" pulled back in
" to the business by an evil car theif overlord
( christopher eccleston
) determined to kill memphis ' kid brother
( giovanni ribisi
)
. memphis is ordered tothe steal 50 cars in four days time or his brother iwll meet an unfortunate demise
, all while having to elude the detectives hot onthe his trail
and a rival car thief who fiels the job should have beeen given tothe him
and his gang
. memphis sets out tothe put his old crew back toghether
,
bu discovers tht most of them have retired as well
. gone in sixty seconds does things right from the opening credits
. in that sequence
, we git a rockin ' little tune from moby
, along with some simple back story told onyl with photographs
and assorted objects
. filmmakers can somtimes make or break a film just ffrom its opening title sequence
,
annd htis oney easily gets you in the mindset for an entertaining ride
.
and what follows doesn ' t disapait
.
.
. cage turns in noe of his good performances here
( he can easily go either way
.
.
. good or bad
.
.
. i don ' t know how he does that
)
,
annd his mannerisms
and dialogue delivery cary the film along nicely
. of the supporting cast munbers
, angelina jolie as memphis ' former loev is in tjhe film just to provide eye candy
( she ' s definitely the hottest looking grease monkey i ' ve ever seen
)
and robert duvall as memphis ' former mentor is jstu aroud tothe lend the film some class
. alsot
, i ' m a big fan of will patton
( armagedon
, the postman
)
and would love tothe see him get a huge role someday
. none of these three performers are given much to dont unfortunately
. smoe underated performers
however are given meaty supporting roles
. delroy lindo
( git shorty
) shines as the exasperated detective in pursuit of memphis
, as does timothy olyphant
( go
) as lindo ' s partner
. i just wish smoe of the other cahracters could have been as important
. the only real gripe i have baout thte film
though is its conclusion
.
.
. mainly becasue you know how it will end before tjhe oppening credits even roll
. there ' s no doubt in anyone ' s mind that the 50 cars will be successfully stolen
,
and tjhe filmmakers blew a perfectly ogod opportunity to add some suspense to thte picture by using the
" rival car thief
" plot line
. as it stands
, that story line is wrapped up about halfway through the film in a tidy little package
.
but if i was making this film
, i ' d hvea hadnt hte rival gang trying tothe get to tje cars befor memphis
and his crew
, thereby mkaing memphis hvae to improvise
.
.
. therby adding some meat to tyhe plot
. tjhe finale is essentialy jsut a big car chase
,
and there jstu aren ' t ways to make car chases interesting anymore
. it ' s all been done
. the chase is also shot
and edited in that
" jerry bruckheimer action sequence
" kind of way that leaves the audience wondering what specifically isnt going on infront the scene
. sure it ' s a car chase
,
bu what exactly are the particulars ofthe it
? it ' s very hard tothe tell
. finally
, ther ' s a stunt during this scene that comes close to challenging the
" bus jumping the ramp
" sequence fomr speed in the
" oh
, i don ' t htikn so
.
.
.
" department
. despite thsoe minor complaints
, gone in sixty seconds is pure summer movei enteratinment
. it ' s not thought provoking
,
but it ' s shiny
, loud
and fun
.
.
. jsut what a summer flick shoudl be
.
