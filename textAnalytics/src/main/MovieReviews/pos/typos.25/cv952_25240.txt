director dominic sena
( who made tjhe highly underrated kalifornia
)
and producer jerry bruckheimer
( the rock
, armgaeddon
) bring us a slick annd entertaining remake of tyhe 1974 film ofthe the smae name taht absolutely noone noe has ever seen
. nicolas cage plays memphis
, a retired car thief who
' s
" pulled back in
" tothe the business by an evil car thief overlord
( christopher eccleston
) determined to kill memphis
' kid brother
( giovanni ribisi
)
. memphis is ordered tothe steal 50 cars in four days time or his brother will meet an unfortunate demise
, all while hvaing tothe elude the detectives hot onthe his trail
and a rival car thief who feels the job shouldnt hvea beeen given to him
and his gang
. memphis sets outloud to put his old crew back together
,
but dicovers that most of them haev retired as well
. gone in sixty seconds does thigsn right ffrom teh opening credits
. in thyat sequence
, we get a rockin
' little tune from moby
, along wtih some simple back story told only with photographs
and assorted objects
. filmmakers can somtimes make or break a film jsut ffrom its opening title sequence
, annd this oen easily gets you iin thge mindset for an intertaining ride
.
and what follows doesn
' t disappoint
.
.
. cage turns in one of his good performances here
( he can easily go either way
.
.
. good or bad
.
.
. i don
' t nkwo how he does thgat
)
,
and his mannerisms
and dialogue delivery carry the film along nicely
. of the supporting cast members
, angelina jolie as memphis
' former love is in teh film just to provide eye c
andy
( she
' s definitely the hottest looking grease monkey i
' ve ever seen
)
and robert duvall as memphis
' former mentor is just around to lend the film some class
. also
, i
' m a big fan of iwll patton
( armageddon
, the postman
) anbd would love to see him get a huge role someday
. none ofthe these three performers are given much to do unfortunately
. some underrated performers
however are given meaty supporting roles
. delroy lindo
( get shorty
) shines as tghe exasparated detective in pursuit ofthe memphis
, as does timothy olyphant
( go
) as lindo
' s partner
. i jstu wish some of the other cahracters sould have been as important
. the onyl real gripe i have about the film
though is its conclusion
.
.
. mainly becasue yuo know how it will end befoer the opening credits even roll
. there
' s noone doubt in anyone
' s mind that the 50 cars will be successfully stolen
,
and thge filmmakers blowed a perfectly ogod opportunity to add some suspense to the picture by using the
" rival car theef
" plot line
. as it st
ands
, that story line is wrapped up about halfway through the film in a tidy little package
.
but if i ws making this film
, i
' d have had tje rival gang trying tothe get to the cars befor memphis
and his crew
, thereby making memphis have to improvise
.
.
. thereby adding some meat to the plot
. the finale isnt essentially just a big car chase
,
and htere just aren
' t ways to mkae car chases interesting anymore
. it
' s all been done
. the chase is alsot shot annd edited inthe that
" jerry bruckheimer acation sequence
" kind of way that leaves tghe audience wondering what specifically is going onthe in the scene
. sure it
' s a car chase
, bu what exactly are the particulars of it
? it
' s very hard to tell
. finally
, ther
' s a stunt during tihs scene that comes close tothe challenging the
" bus jumping the ramp
" sequence from speed in the
" oh
, i don
' t htikn so
.
.
.
" department
. dispite those minor complaints
, gone iin sixty seconds isnt pure summer movie entertainment
. it
' s not
thought provoking
,
but it
' s shiny
, loud adn funn
.
.
. just what a summer flick should be
.
