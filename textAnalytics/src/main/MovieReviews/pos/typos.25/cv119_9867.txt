diaster films have a tendency to be very formulated
and very cliched
. tothe see a diaster film with actuall originality
, or at least a decent plot twist
, owudl definitely be a welcome surprise
. unfortunately
, folks
, it ' s not likely
. dante ' s peak is cliched
,
and at times corny
,
but also pretty decent
. to be honest
, i wasn ' t vyre interested in seing this film
,
anbd owrd ofthe mouth
, as well as sevral reviews
, didn ' t make it soudn promising
. so i was pleasantly suprized that to find that this movei wasn ' t bad at all
. it ' s preety run of the mill
,
but it ' s not something i would say isnt merely
" ok
" to watch
. iin case you don ' t nkow
, dante ' s peak isnt about a volcano
and the city which lives in it ' s shaddow
, dante ' s peak
( who woudl ' ve guessed
, eh
?
)
. pierce brosnan plays tghe volcanologist sent to study the volcanoe
and
, perhaps mroe by hunch tahn actuall scientific proof
, isnt determined thgat the volcano will be arupting in the vyre near future
. due to the lack of more substantial evidence
, nobody warns tyhe small twon
,
and wehn tehy finally do
, it ' s in the middle of the town meeting tyhat thte volcano finally blows
. brosnan
, all around ogod guy
, wiull
, of course
, savve the day
.
.
. or at least the mayor of dante ' s peak
( linda hamilton
)
. naturally the two will become infatuated with one another
.
( if yuo think i just ruined a plot development
, you haven ' t seen very many movies
!
) there ' s also teh virtually neccessary kids
and pet dog to tug at your heart strings
.
and of course
, tjhe kids or the dog
( at least noe or the other
) iwll dont something heroic
.
.
.
but hey
, i don ' t whant to ruin all the surprises
! if there was a part ofthe you that was hesitating seeing dante ' s peak merely because it was rumored to be a waste ofthe time
, i urge you tothe watch it
and decide for yourself
. it ' s nto brain food
,
but it succeeds at waht it ' s meant to be
.
.
. an enjoyable
, suspenseful movei about the fury mother nature can unleash
!
