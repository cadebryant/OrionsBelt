disaster films have a tendacy to be veyr formulated
and very cliched
. to see a disaster film with actual originality
, or at least a decent plot twist
, woudl definitely be a welcome surprise
. unfortunately
, folks
, it
' s not likely
. dante
' s peak is cliched
,
and at times corny
,
but also pretty decent
. to be honest
, i wasn
' t vyer interested in seeing this film
, annd owrd ofthe mouth
, as well as several reviews
, didn
' t make it soudn promising
. so i was pleasantly surprised that to find that this movie wasn
' t bad at all
. it
' s pretty run of the mill
,
but it
' s not something i would say is mearly
" ok
" tothe watch
. iin case you don
' t know
, dante
' s peak is about a volcanoe
and tje city which lives in it
' s shadow
, dante
' s peak
( who would
' ve guessed
, eh
?
)
. pierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcanoe
and
, perheaps more by hunch thna actual scientific proof
, is determined that the volcanoe will be arupting infact thge very near future
. due tothe the lack of omre substantial evidence
, nobody warns the small town
,
and whn they finally do
, it
' s in the middle of the town meeting that the volcanoe finally blows
. brosnan
, all arround ogod guy
, iwll
, of course
, save tje day
.
.
. or at least the mayor of dante
' s peak
( linda hamilton
)
. naturally yhe two will become infatuated wih one anohter
.
( if you think i jsut ruined a plot development
, ytou haven
' t seen very many movies
!
) ther
' s aslo hte virtually neccessary kids anbd pet dog tothe tug at your heart strings
.
and ofthe course
, the kids or the dog
( at least one or the other
) will do something heroic
.
.
.
but hey
, i don
' t want to ruin all tje surprises
! if htere was a part of you that wass hesitating seeing dante
' s peak merely because it was rumored to be a waste of time
, i urger you tothe watch it
and decide for yourself
. it
' s nto brain food
,
but it succeds at what it
' s meant to be
.
.
. an enjoyable
, suspenseful movei about tyhe fury mother nature can unleash
!
