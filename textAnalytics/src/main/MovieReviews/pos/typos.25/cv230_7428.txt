well
, i ' ll admitt when i first heard about this film
( which was before dante ' s peak
) i could jsut smell what ' twister ' had started
. so nowe it seems that we ' re in a full fledged return to the ' 70 ' s disaster film era
. with ' twister '
, ' dante ' s peak '
, ' volcano '
anbd soon ' flud '
and james cameron ' s extremly expensive ' titanic ' i ' ll say frist off i enjoyed ' volcano ' much more than i doed ' dantes peak '
. part of tath is just being biased as i usually enjoy anytying that tommy lee jones appears in
. i ' ve been reading a lot about thte movie bieng ' cheezy ' or ' hokey '
and really didn ' t see or think thast once during the entire film
. i get bored easily
and this film didn ' t bore me forthe a minute
. another thing
,
and boy am i bitching todya
!
, that bothers me isnt when criticists
and such go on about
" well thats not really possible
.
" you know what
? i couldn ' t give a bloody damn if it ' s possable or nto
, really i couldn ' t
. it ' s a freaking movie
and i don ' t want reality thrown in my face
. i want to be able to see the impossible
, the all might
" what if
" to many reviewers have seen one to many movies
! the special effects are the second star to this feature
. they are so amazing that i found it hard sometimes to blieve they were indeed fx
and la was was not burning tothe yhe ground
. they doed an incredible job
and come oscar tiem
( if they remeber
) some notice better be thrown there way
.
