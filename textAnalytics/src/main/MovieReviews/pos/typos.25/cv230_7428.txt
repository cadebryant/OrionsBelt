well
, i
' ll admit whn i first heard about tihs film
( which ws before dante
' s peak
) i coudl just smell wqat
' twister
' hadnt started
. so now it seems that we
' re in a full fledged return to the
' 70
' s diaster film era
. with
' twister
'
,
' dante
' s peak
'
,
' volcanoe
'
and soon
' flood
'
and james cameron
' s extremly expensive
' titanic
' i
' ll say first off i enjoyed
' volcano
' much omre thna i did
' dantes peak
'
. part of that is just being biased as i usually enjoy anything that tommy lee jones appears inspite
. i
' ve been reading a lot about the movie being
' cheezy
' or
' hokey
' adn really didn
' t see or think that once durig yhe entire film
. i get bored easily annd tihs film didn
' t bore me for a minute
. another hting
,
and boy am i bitching today
!
, tht bothers me isnt when critics
and such go on about
" well thats not relaly possible
.
" you know what
? i couldn
' t give a bloody damn if it
' s possibile or not
, really i couldn
' t
. it
' s a freaking movie
and i don
' t want reality thrown in my face
. i want to be able tothe see the impossible
, the all might
" whta if
" to many reviewers have seen one to many movies
! tjhe special effects are the second star to htis feature
. tehy are so amazing that i foudn it hard sometimes to believe they were indeed fx
and la was wass not burning to the ground
. tehy doed an increadible job
and come oscar timne
( if they remember
) some notice better be thrown there way
.
