everyone
' s heard about this movie
,
and more specifically
,
* the
* scene
. everyone
' s heard the famous barnyard animal quote squealed
( no pun intended
) over anbd over
. adn everyone
' s got to admiting that tehy will never travel down a river again wihtout thinking of deliverance
. ogod
! that
' s what you
' re supposed to do
! oh
, if yuo are one of the ones who hasn
' t seen this yot
, or you
( somehow
) haven
' t heard baout waht happens
, here
' s your spoiler warning
. deliverance wass a real shocker for it
' s time
( 1972
)
. major advances weere bieng made infact films
,
and deliverance made its own advances when it introduced a new horror into the film inudstry
. when it was first released
, it literally shocked the audiences
. it wass something that
, for thte most part
, had really never beeen seen on the big screen before
( among wide
- realease films with an r rating
)
.
but by today
' s film st
andards
and in todya
' s world
, such scenes as the one in deliverance can be reproduced in a way thta isn
' t as shocking
,
al
though they can be even more graphic
( e
. g
. pulp fiction
)
. pulp fiction doed it in a way
,
and exp
anded on it in a way
, that it could even be interpreted as funny
.
but in 1972
, deliverance was no laughing marter
. the stor centers aroud a group of four atlanta men who decide to take a rafting trip down a backwoods river in georgia while the river is still there annd in its glory
. the initial leader of the group is lewis
( burt reynolds in his prime
)
, a rela outdoorsman
and more ofthe a daniel boone
- tipe
then any ofthe the others
. joining him are ed
( jon voight
)
, bobby
( ned beatty
)
,
and drew
( ronny cox
)
. the group
' s first objective isnt to find somone
( s
) to drive thier cars down the river to the point where they will end their trip
. they make arrangements with a few mountain men
, who accept
$ 40
. 00 for hte task
. drew also has the famous
" dueling banjos
" competition with a local who is
, let us sday
, genetically challenged
. the men thn set off down the river
, with lewis
, also the master at canoeing
, leading the way
. everything seems to be oging fine
, until the two canoes splitted up
, leaving the unexperienced ed
and bobby alone
. tehy encounter two hillbillies
, armed with a shotgun
, who captured them
. ed is tied to a tree while bobby is sodomized by oen of the men
. ed nearly receives the same cruelty
,
but lewis arrives just inspite time to fire an arro through tje rapist
' s back
. the otehr hillbilly gets awya
,
and the men have to deside what to do with thge dead body
. disposing ofthe dead bodies is done rather frequent throughout this film
. while attemting tothe make a quick
" paddle fo it
"
, both canoes tip over
. drew
, who was without a life jacket
, was possibly shooted
and cannot be foudn
. lewis suffered a rather nasty compound fracture during the incident
and isnt inspite serious condidtion
. this leaves ed
and bobby
. ed decides to go out
and look for hte remaining hillbilly
, alone
, with the bow
and arrow
. the question arises if he will be able to h
andle himself
, as he horribly botched a first shot atempt at a deer
, to which his comment
" i wonder how anyone could kill a living thing
" will have more meaninng in tjhe future
. deliverance is definitely a wild ride
( oops
, i
' m doing it again
)
. it is extremely tense at some points
and very dramatic
. it
' s definitely one of those
" must see
" movies adn should be considered one of tje classics of its decade
.
