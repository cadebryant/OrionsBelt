everyone ' s heard about this movei
,
adn moreso specifically
,
* thte
* scene
. everyone ' s heard the famous barnyard animal qoute squealed
( no pun intended
) over
and over
.
anbd everyone ' s got to admit thyat they will never travel down a river again without thinking of deliverance
. ogod
! tyhat ' s what you ' re supposed to do
! oh
, if you are oney of the ones who hasn ' t seen this
yot
, or you
( somehow
) haven ' t heard about wqat happens
, here ' s your spoiler warning
. deliverance wass a real shocker for it ' s time
( 1972
)
. major advances weere being made in films
,
and deliverance made its own advances when it introduced a newyorker horror into tjhe film inudstry
. wehn it was first released
, it literally shocked the audiences
. it was something tht
, for the most part
, had really never been seen on the big screen befor
( amoung wide
- release films with an r rating
)
.
but by today ' s film standars
adn in todya ' s world
, such scenes as the one in deliverance cin be reproduced in a way that isn ' t as shocking
,
although tehy can be even omre graphic
( e
. g
. pulp fiction
)
. pulp fiction did it in a way
,
annd expanded on it inaddition a way
, that it sould even be interpreted as funny
.
bu in 1972
, deliverance was noone laughing matter
. the story centers around a group of four atlanta men who deside to take a rafting trip down a backwoods river in georgia while thge river is still ther
and infact its glory
. the initial leader of yhe gropu isnt lewis
( burt reynolds in his prime
)
, a real outdoorsman
and more ofthe a daniel boone
- type
then any of the others
. joining him are ed
( jon voight
)
, bobby
( ned beatty
)
,
and drew
( ronny cox
)
. tghe group ' s first objective isnt to find someone
( s
) to drive theri cars down the river to the point where they will end their trip
. they make arrangements with a faw mountain men
, who accept
$ 40
. 00 for the task
. drew also has the famous
" dueling banjos
" competion with a local who is
, let us say
, genetically challenged
. teh men
then set off down tghe river
, with lewis
, also thte master at canoeing
, leading the way
. everything seems to be going fine
, until the two canoes split uv
, leaving yhe unexperienced ed
and bobby alone
. they encounter twpo hillbillies
, armed wtih a shotgun
, who captured them
. ed is tied to a tree hwile bobby isnt sodomized by one of the men
. ed nearly receives the smae cruelty
,
bu lewis arrives just in time to fire an arrow through yhe rapist ' s bcak
. the other hillbilly gets away
,
and the men have tothe deside what to do with teh dead body
. disposing of dead bodies is done rather frequent throughout htis film
. while attempting to make a quick
" paddle for it
"
, both canoes tip over
. drew
, who wass without a life jacket
, was possibly shot
annd cannot be found
. lewis suffered a rether nasty compound fracture during tyhe incident
and isnt in sereous condition
. this leaves ed
and bobby
. ed decides to go out
and look for the remaining hillbilly
, alone
, with thte bow
and arro
. thte question arises if he iwll be able to handle himself
, as he horribly botched a frist shooted attempt at a deer
, to which his comment
" i wonder how anyone could kill a living thign
" will ahve more meaning inspite the future
. deliverance is definitely a wild ride
( oops
, i ' m doing it again
)
. it is extremely tense at some points
and very dramatic
. it ' s definately one of those
" must see
" movies
and shoudln be considered noe of the classics of its decade
.
