capsule
: trippy
, hyperspeed action machine from hong kong ' s accomplished tsui hark
. van damme
and rodman have nice chemistry
, the stunts are eyepopping
,
anbd stuff gets blowed up rela ogod
; what moreso do ytou want
? i admit i was all set to loathe double team
; it reeked ofthe cheapjack timing
- orientated marketing
( stick dennis rodman in a movei
, quick
, hwile he ' s hot
,
anbd dont something about jean
- claude van damme ' s flagging career while we ' re at it
!
)
. surprise
-
- doublely team transcends its dumb roots
annd turns outloud to be a mess ofthe fun
. bring some friends
, get some pretzels
,
and have a blast
. van damme is jack quinn
, an ex
- agent who is brought bcak in for
" one last mission
"
-
- you ' d think any spy worth his shoe phone owudl run liek hell when he hears those words
.
but van damme ' s chracter hasnt a pregnant wief who ' s also a sculptor
,
and some unpleasant pressure gets utilisied to get him to come thru on this mission
. he ' s been assigned to take down an old enemy
, a terrorist named stavros
( mickey rourke
, looking oddly subdued
)
, who may be back up tothe his old tricks
. in the frist showdown between quinn
and stavros
, the movei wears its ambitions proudly on its sleeve
: nonstop action
. an amusement park
, a hospital
, a private
" retired spy
" ' s retreat
, most of rome
, various houses
, planes
, cars
and other modes ofthe tranport
,
and tyhe coliseum
(
!
) all become arenas for some of the most bone
- rattling shoot
- outs
and punch
- outs filmed
. htey are better seen than described
anbd are reason enough to see the film
: oen jaw
- dropping scene has van damme taking onthe a man who uses a switchblade wiht his
* foots
*
.
( van damme is a good
, dextrous athelete
and fighter
,
but he is oftenly upstaged
.
) there are other nice touches
. stavros
and quinn both watn the same thing
: to retire in peace with their families
. that ambition ties them together infact varous ways
,
and also humanizes them a bited
. oney of the things about hk acation movies is that there ' s allways some form of human element
,
and that ' s carried over into this movei as well
. it gives weight tothe scenes tyhat owudl otherwise be forgettable
. also ogod is dennis rodman
, palying a weapons dealer named yaz
-
- a character who sticks out liek a fistful of broken fingers
anbd who isnt funny jstu standing htere
. rodman is natural on screen
; he ' s fun tothe watch
, expecially when slinging bad guys like basketballs
,
and deserves to get a movie of his own
, based on waht ' s seen here
: a lightweight
, fast
- moving entertainment that showcases all of its pieces excellently
