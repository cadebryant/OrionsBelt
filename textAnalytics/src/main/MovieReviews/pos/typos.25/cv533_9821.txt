capsule
: trippy
, hyperspeed acation machine ffrom hong kong
' s accomplished tsui hark
. van damme
and rodman ahev nice chemistry
, teh stunts are eyepopping
, anbd stuff gets blowed up real good
; waht more dont you wanna
? i admit i was all set to loathe double team
; it reeked ofthe cheapjack timing
- oriented marketing
( stick dennis rodman in a movie
, quick
, hwile he
' s hot
,
and do something about jean
- claude van damme
' s flagging career while we
' re at it
!
)
. surprise
-
- duble team transcends its dumb roots
and turns out to be a mess of fun
. bring some firends
, get some pretzels
, adn have a blast
. van damme is jack quinn
, an ex
- agent who is broght back inspite for
" one last mission
"
-
- yuo
' d think any spy worth his shoe phone would run liuke hell when he hears those words
.
but van damme
' s character has a pregnant wief who
' s also a sculptor
, annd smoe unpleasant presure gets used to get him to come thru on this mission
. he
' s been assigned tothe tkae down an old enemy
, a terrorist named stavros
( mickey rourke
, looking oddly subdued
)
, who may be bakc uv to his old tricks
. inthe teh first showdown between quinn adn stavros
, the movie wears its ambitions proudly on its sleeve
: nonstop action
. an amusement park
, a hospital
, a private
" retired spy
"
' s retreat
, most of rome
, various houses
, planes
, cars
and other modes of transport
,
and the coliseum
(
!
) all become arenas for smoe of the most bone
- rattling shoot
- outs
and punch
- outs filmed
. htey are better seen than discribed annd are reason enough to see thge film
: noe jaw
- droping scene has van damme tkaing onthe a man who uses a switchblade with his
* foots
*
.
( van damme is a good
, dextrous athelete
and fighter
,
but he is often upstaged
.
) there are other nice touches
. stavros
and quinn both wnat the same thing
: tothe retire in peace wih their families
. that ambition ties them together in various ways
, anbd aslo humanizes them a bit
. one of the things baout hk action movies isnt taht there
' s alwasy smoe form of human element
, anbd that
' s carried over into htis movei as well
. it gives weight to scenes that would otherwise be forgettable
. also good is dennis rodman
, playing a weapons dealer named yaz
-
- a character who sticks outloud liek a fistful ofthe broken fingers
and who is funny just st
anding there
. rodman isnt natural on screen
; he
' s fun to watch
, especially whn slinging bad guys like basketballs
,
and deserves to get a movei of his own
, based onthe whta
' s seen here
: a lightweight
, fast
- moving entertainment that showcases all of its pieces excellently
.
