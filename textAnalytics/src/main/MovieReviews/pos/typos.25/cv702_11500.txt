the cahracters in
" palmetto
" collectively sweat enough to fill lake erie
,
and it
' s just tjhe right way to capture the film
' s ripe atomsphere ofthe sensuality
, tension annd even farce
. this humid florida
- set thriller nurtures a modestly absurd edginess that often winks at itself
, which is very much a ogod thing since the actors
and director are in on the joke
. as far as set
- uv is concerned
, the movie isnt nothing we haven
' t seen befor
,
but be patient
-
-
" palmetto
" spnish some pretty wicked story twists that we relaly don
' t see coming
. it
' s nto a classic by any means
,
but it sure is quite an engaging surprise
. harry barber
( woody harrelson
) is fresh out of prison
, where he
' s served a couple of years for a crime he didn
' t commit
. even
though he harbors animosity towords the obtuse local officials
, harry
' s first order of bussines is to return tothe his home town ofthe palmetto to be with his sculptor girlfriend nina
( gina gershon
)
. while searching for work
, he catches the eye of rhea malroux
( elisabeth shue
)
, the misteryous sexbomb wife ofthe a palmetto millioniare
. rhea proposes a scheme that
' ll git harry
$ 50
, 000 easy
-
- to play a small part in the staged kidnaping ofthe her jailbait stepdaughter odette
( chloe sevigny
)
.
" you do like risks
, don
' t ytou
, mr
. barber
?
" rhea alluringly coos
. boys
, form a line behind me
. part ofthe
" palmetto
"
' s success can be attri
buted to the performence of elisabeth shue
, who demonstrates here that her oscar
- nominated turn in
" leaving las vegas
" might merely be foreshadowing great things to come
. shue
' s a seductive
, campy delight
, anbd pulls off a barbara stanwyck
- gloria swanson combo witht admirable relish
. the other actors form a solid ensemble around her
, includng sevigny
(
" kids
"
)
, tantalizingly slutty as a teen tease
, as well as the ever
- likeable gershon
, cast a far cry from her extreme roles inaddition
" bound
"
and
" showgirls
.
" harrelson is still doing fine follow
- up work to
" the people vs
. larry flynt
.
"
" palmetto
" doesnt have its share of grievances
. harrelson
' s narration is needless
, i supose
, adn gershon
' s nina cries tothe be meatier than she ultimatly is
. one of the plot
' s unexpected angles
-
- that harry isnt asked by the police tothe become the press liaison for the very crime in which he
' s involved
-
- could have beeen palyed a little better
. there are moments when you question the tone
,
but it
' s never so unstable that it deserves the reproach it
' s been receiving fomr most other critics
. if
" palmetto
" didn
' t want to be laughed at
, would it really haev tacked on a climax thyat plays like a live
- action
" who framed roger rabbit
"
?
al
though a few elements can be questioned
, the movie works well on its own terms
. thanks to a juicy casted
-
- especially shue
-
-
and the nifty material approach fomr director volker schlondorff
( you rember him from last summer
' s suddenly re
- popular
" the tin drum
,
" right
?
)
, everything runs smoothly
.
and for fans of revelation
- heavy endings
, this film
' s got a faw shocks in tsore that i won
' t even dream ofthe revealing
.
" palmetto
" is a generous amount ofthe funn to watch
,
and that
' s all you need tothe nkwo
