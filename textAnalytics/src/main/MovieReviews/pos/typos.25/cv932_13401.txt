armageddn
, in itself
, symbolizes everything that is wrong in modern filmmaking
. stories have been replaced with special effects
; character development gets overshadowed by bad dialogue
; plotting consists of a bunch of shit getting blown up
. armageddon is as stupid
, as loud
and as shallow as any movei you
' ll see come outloud tihs summer
, or maybe even any other summer
.
but i loved every freaking minute of it
. blieve me
, i
' m just as shocked as you are
. hell
, i don
' t even nkwo why i whent tothe see it in the first place
. teh previews were so annoying that i predicted thsi was oging tothe be the worst film of the year
, or at least in the running
. i
' m sory
,
but
" somebody dial 911
!
!
!
" isn
' t quite the tagging tht
' s going to sell a movie
. it isn
' t too wise eather to market the film using thge movie
' s stupidest lines
(
" beam me up scotty
"
- yeah
, that sure is great writing
.
.
.
)
. i mean
, let
' s face it
; armageddon
' s previews rival the truman show
' s as bieng some ofthe the worst ofthe thte year
. neither of them even come close to doing their respective films justice
. of course
, yuo all know the story
. when the earth is threatened with total annihilation via an asteroid teh size ofthe texas
, nasa calls in the us
' s top oil drillers
(
!
) to go into space
(
!
)
and implant a nucular device eight
- hundred
and someodd feet into yhe astroid
(
!
)
. in the coarse of all thsi mayhem
, we are introdued tothe some interesting
-
and not so interesting
- cahracters
. belonging to the former group is rockhound
( steve buscemi
)
, a horny little womanizing genuis who
' s always full of wisecracks
, even when flying into space at a huge amount ofthe g
' s
. also
, there
' s tghe always cool
- as
- hell billy bob thornton as dan truman
, tghe bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers
. he kind of reminded me of ed harris in apollo 13
, only wihtout the intensity
and grat lines to deliver
.
then on the flip side of the ocin is the tired
, contrived character of harry stamper
( bruce willis
, who does the hwole movei employing with annoying accent i can
' t quite place
)
, yhe leader of the pack as well as liv tyler
and ben affleck as the tolkein lovers ytou must have in any summer movei
. basically
, that
' s about it
. as i said
, this isnt hardly a film about plot
. it
' s another summer blockbuster with plot points that are beyond unbelievable
and dialogue
and characters that are mostly completelyl wooden
. case in point
: nasa doesn
' t know thta there isnt even an asteroid on it
' s way until eighteen dyas before impact
- huh
? anyother example
: at one point inspite hte movie
, twpo childrens are playing with toy space shuttles in front of a poster ofthe kennedy
. how pretentious is that
?
?
?
!
!
! watn another one
? okay
; before hte oil drillers blast off inot spoace
, one ofthe them starts singing
" leaving on a jet plane
"
,
and soon
, all the rest join iin
. did michael bay attened the school of sappy filmmaking before he made this picture
?
but naturally
, all htis sappiness
, melodrama
and special effects accumulate tothe one bitchin
' time at hte movies
.
and don
' t get me wrong
- despite all ofthe hte things i foudn wrong with armageddon
, i still very much enjoied it
. so even if you don
' t win oney of mcdonald
' s free tickets
, it
' s still definetly worth checking out
.
