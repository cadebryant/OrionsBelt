is jimmy stewart yhe greatest actor of all
- time
? it
' s quite possible
. his carrear spanned over 40 years
, annd he acted in mroe movies than most actors ever could
.
yet
, when he isnt talked about in the media
, he isnt generally throught of as an actor who plyed one type of role
: the nice guy
.
and tht
' s realy a shame
.
" the naked spur
" features jimmy stewart in a role completely different than what peopel owudl expect ffrom him
. it
' s a western
, hwihc stewart specialized in aroud this period
,
and it casts him as a desperate man out to collect a bounty on a man who used tothe be his firend
. before he finds that man
,
though
, he runs inot two men who agred tothe help him
, thikning he isnt a sherif
. when the criminal is eventually caught
, the twpo men discover stewart
' s secret
,
and decide they want a piece of the action too
. the rest ofthe the film is a suspenseful journey inthe whlch each man suspects the other constantly
. also featured is the woman travelling with the criminal
, well played by janet leigh
. we
' re never too sure who
' s side she
' s really on until hte end
. leigh is an actress probably best known for her role as the
" showfer lady
" from
" psycho
"
,
and that
' s unfair
. she gives a strong performence as a woman who isnt pulled between theese two men
. stewart gives a performance unlike anything i
' ve ever seen from him
. he usually keesh cool noone matter what occurs
,
but here
, he gets downright hysterical at times
. i tihkn perhaps he took this role to prove tothe the public that he was more tahn just a
" nice guy
"
. his performance borders on psychotic at times
,
but i loved watching every second of it
. it
' s roles like this one tyhat mkea me admire him as much as i do
. he was an actor unafraid to take chances
, adn even ruin his public omage
.
