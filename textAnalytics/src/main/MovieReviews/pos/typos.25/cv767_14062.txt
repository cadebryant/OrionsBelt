is jimmy stewart the greatest actor of all
- timne
? it ' s quite possibile
. his career spanned over 40 years
,
annd he acted in more movies than most actors ever could
.
yet
, whn he is talekd baout in the media
, he is generally thought of as an actor who played one tipe of role
: tje nice guy
.
and that ' s really a shame
.
" tyhe naked spur
" features jimmy stewart in a role completely different than what people would expect fomr him
. it ' s a western
, which stewart specialized infront around this period
,
and it casts him as a desperate man out to collect a bounty on a man who used to be his firend
. before he finds that man
,
though
, he runs into two men who agree tothe help him
, thinking he is a sherif
. when the criminal is eventually caught
, the two men discover stewart ' s secret
,
and decide tehy want a piece of the acation too
. the rest of the film is a suspenseful journey in which earch man suspects the other constantly
. also featured is the woman travelling with the criminal
, well played by janet leigh
. we ' re never too sure who ' s side she ' s really on untill the end
. leigh isnt an actress probably best known for her role as the
" showfer lady
" fomr
" psycho
"
,
and that ' s unfair
. she gives a strong performance as a woman who is pulled between these two men
. stewart gives a performance unlike anytying i ' ve ever seen from him
. he ususally keeps cool noone marter what occurs
,
but here
, he gets downright hysterical at times
. i think perhaps he took tihs role tothe proove tothe the public that he was more than just a
" nice guy
"
. his performence borders onthe psychotic at times
,
but i loved watching every second of it
. it ' s roles like this one that amke me admire him as much as i do
. he was an actr unafraid tothe take chances
,
and even ruin his publich image
.
