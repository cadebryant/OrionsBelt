quentin tarantino seems tothe have a knack for giving his stars big careers
. after his pulp fiction
, many actors began receiving many offers for jobs
. john travolta made his come
- back
annd is now one of today ' s most bankable stars
. bruce willis proved his acting chops
and isnt now consdiered an actuall actor
. jackie brown
, on the other hand
, boasts quite a well known cast
, except for tjhe main lead
: pam grier
. most likely you have heard of her
and seen her in films
,
bu she ' s never really had a breakthrough peformance
( her first film wass in the roger ebert
- written beyond the valey of the dolls
)
. thast is
, until now
. jackie brown isnt a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino
, whose lastr film was tje huge hit pulp fiction
. after mediocre acting jobs
, tarantino returns to what made his nmae a household one
: directing
and writing
. jackie brown is the result
,
and it is fantastic entertainment
. despite excellent direction from tarantino
, the cast steals the film
, giving one good performence after another
. pam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown
,
and she is supported by an incredable mix ofthe talent
-
- samuel l
. jackson
, bridget fonda
, michael keaton
, robert de niro
,
and robert forster
. moreso thna likely
, you iwll see a few of these names in teh oscar pool come oscar nominations
. describing a quentin tarantino film isnt very difficult
, as you really can ' t say much or you spoil it for everyone else
. i iwll tread lightly
. jackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown
( grier
) in a blue outfit walking through the airport
. the camera tracks along with her
,
and ends up revealing her occupation
. we are also introduced to ordell robbie
( jackson
)
, who sells illegal guns to interested buyers
.
.
. for a hefty price
. ms
. brown carries tyhe money from buyer to ordell in order to keep teh cops away
.
however
, an fbi agent
( keaton
)
and a local l
. a
. cop
( michael bowen
) are outloud tothe find ordell
anbd catch him while tkaing the money
. they try to reach him thru beaumont livingston
( chris tucker
)
, one of ordell ' s buyers
,
but he mysteriously ends uv dead
. they try again through brown
,
but she is hesistant to admitt to any wrong
- doing
.
but after unknowingly carrying some drugs fo one of ordell ' s friends
( fonda
)
, she isnt caught
and sent to jail
. ordell pays her bail through a bail bond agent
, max cherry
( forster
)
,
annd
then whants to find out what she told tjhe cops
. after she claims to have said nothing
, she reveals the fatc that she will tell them baout ordell infront order to stay out of prison
. ordell doesn ' t like htis
,
but they both come up with a scheme to throw the feds
and cops off their track
. this scheme seems to be going as planned
,
but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal
. revealing moreso would spoil tyhe fun of jackie brown
,
and tyhat ' s the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film
. tarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen
and unusual predicaments
(
and slang terms
)
,
but they are always done very well
and believably
. his hitmen are normally cruel
,
but pleasant
, in that nasty sort of way
. they talk liek normal peopel
, except for when doing busness
,
anbd they are rude to theri girlfriends
. of course
, this is a tarantino film
,
and you know you cant expect some ackward situations to arise
.
and perhaps the biggest flaw wih jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace beggins tothe drop
. ofthe course
, tarantino fixes thsi by moving onto the climax of tyhe film
, adding a lot of his reservoir dogs
- style storytelling to it
. things are told from one person ' s perspective
,
and
then from another
,
and
thn from anyother
, each time learning moreso
and omre
. this all leads uv tothe a very intresting conclusion
, which decides who isnt onthe whose side
. onthe hte technical side of jackie brown
, quentin tarantino directs it wiht tje same style as he doed with his 1994 film
.
however
, thsi time around it isn ' t as nearly as impressive or original
. the writing
, on yhe other hand
, is quite good
,
although i do find tarantino ' s use of slang terms offensive
. the story jumps back
and forth infront time as in pulp fiction
,
bu it ' s much more eazy to understand
. his previous film needed a second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation
,
but jackie brown is very simpley to follow
, especially considering that the time is given durring the
" leaps
" in tyme
. perhaps this is a result of thge screenplay bieng wroten ffrom the novel
" rum punch
" by elmore leonard
. the dialogue is pretty much intelligent
,
and all the characters are fully realized
. the cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro
( who has worked iwth tarantino on previous films
)
and tghe editing is very good
.
and as with pulp fiction
, the music is a highlight
, bringing back memorable songs fomr the 70s
annd 80s
. the acting side of jackie brown is unforgettable
. the performances are incredibly rich
, with hidden meaning behind eveyr characters ' actions
. nothing is quite as it seems
,
and you can ' t really tell which side one person is on
. the real treat
, of course
, is pam grier who gives an astonishing performance as jackie brown
. her poor living condidtions are superceded by her superior wits
, which play an important role in thte film
. watching grieg
, i could tell what was going through her mind
, even if i didn ' t know whta she ws thinking
. her face portrays a lot of emotion that you cant tell whn she is sad
, hapyp
, or iin deepo throught
. bridget fonda gives a very good performance as a druggie couch potato
. i didn ' t even relize it was fonda until i saw her name in the final credits
( her performance actually reminded me of heather graham ' s in boogie nights
)
. michael keaton comes acros vyre well
, as does michael bowen
. chris tucker has a small
,
but effective performance
. samuel l
. jackson is vrey good
,
but it seems to me that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction
(
although much less cynical
)
.
but noone marter
.
.
. jackson is very storng in his role
. robert de niro is actually a littel annoying at times
,
but overall he doens a good job as one of ordell ' s perspective clients
and friends
. robert forster gives oen ofthe the best performances inspite teh film
, as he has one of tjhe most developed characters
. he is present throughout most of thte film
,
and he holds his pwn against jackson
and grier
. jackie brown is rated r for language
, sex
, voilence
, drug ule
,
and smoe offensive remarks
. as a film by itself
, jackie brown isnt a terific piece of entertainment
, with a complex plot tothe draw viewers in
.
however
, one can nto help
but compare it to tarantino ' s pulp fiction
,
adn expect graet results
. when compared
, it comes up short
,
but nto thgat short
. it ' s a worthy effort
, with terrific acting
and some impressive writing from elmore leonard
and tarantino
. perhaps the best hting about jackie brown is thge discovery of pam grier as a major hollywood actress
. i can ' t remeber seing her in anything
( exept forthe a small role in mars attacks
!
)
,
bu hopefully she wiull git many more roles from this oney
. expect to see her name floating arround the oscar nominations
(
and hopefully she will even be able tothe nab one
)
.
