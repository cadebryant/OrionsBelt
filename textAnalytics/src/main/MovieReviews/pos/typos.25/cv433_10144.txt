quentin tarantino seems to have a knack for giving his stars big careers
. after his pulp fiction
, many actors began receiving many offers for jobs
. john travolta made his come
- back
and is nowe one ofthe today
' s most bankable stars
. bruce willis proved his acting chops
and is nowe consdidered an actual actor
. jackie brown
, onthe tyhe other h
and
, boasts quite a well known cast
, except for tghe main lead
: pam grier
. most likely ytou have heard of her annd seen her in films
,
but she
' s never realyl hadnt a breakthrough performence
( her first film was in teh roger ebert
- written beyond the valley of the dolls
)
. that is
, until now
. jackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino
, whose last film was tje huge hit pulp fiction
. after mediocre acting jobs
, tarantino returns to what made his nmae a household one
: directing
and writing
. jackie brown is the result
,
and it is fantastic entertainment
. dispite excelent direction fomr tarantino
, the cast steals tyhe film
, giving one good performance after anyother
. pam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown
, anbd she is supported by an incredible mix of talent
-
- samuel l
. jackson
, bridget fonda
, michael keaton
, robert de niro
,
and robert forster
. more than likely
, yuo iwll see a few of these names in the oscar pool cmo oscar nominations
. decribing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult
, as you really cxan
' t say much or you spoil it for everyone else
. i will tread lightly
. jackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown
( grier
) inspite a blue outfit walking thru the airprot
. the camera tracks along with her
,
and ends up revealing her occupation
. we are also itnroduced to ordell robbie
( jackson
)
, who sells ilegle guns to interested buyers
.
.
. for a hefty price
. ms
. brown carries tyhe money ffrom buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away
.
however
, an fbi agent
( keaton
)
and a local l
. a
. cop
( michael bowen
) are out to find ordell
and catch him while tkaing the money
. they try to reach him through beaumont livingston
( chris tucker
)
, one of ordell
' s buyers
, bu he mysteriously ends uv dead
. they try again thru brown
,
but she is hesistant tothe admited tothe any wrong
- doing
. bu affter unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordell
' s friends
( fonda
)
, she is caught anbd sent tothe jail
. ordell pays her bail through a bail bond agent
, max cherry
( forster
)
, anbd thne wants to find out waht she told the cops
. after she claimes to ahve said nothing
, she reveals the fact taht she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison
. ordell doesn
' t like this
, bu they both come up with a scheme to throw the feds adn cops off their track
. this scheme seems to be going as planned
,
but unexpected occurances may or may nto foul up their goal
. revealing more would spoil the fun ofthe jackie brown
, anbd that
' s the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film
. tarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen
and unusual predicaments
(
and slang terms
)
,
but they are always done very well
and believably
. his hitmen are normally cruel
, bu pleasant
, in that nasty sort of way
. they talk like normal people
, except for whn doing business
,
and they are rude to their girlfriends
. of course
, thsi isnt a tarantino film
,
and you know yuo can expect some awkward situations to arise
.
and perhaps the biggest flaw wtih jackie brown is the slow middle section inspite which the pace begins to drop
. of course
, tarantino fixes this by moving onto the climax ofthe hte film
, adding a lot of his reservoir dogs
- style storytelling tothe it
. things are told fomr one person
' s perspective
,
and
then from another
,
and
then from another
, each timne learning omre adn mroe
. tihs all leads up to a veyr interesting conclusion
, whlch decides who is on whose side
. on the technical side of jackie brown
, quentin tarantino directs it with the smae style as he did with his 1994 film
.
however
, this time arund it isn
' t as nearly as impressive or original
. the writting
, onthe tyhe other h
and
, is quite good
,
al
though i do find tarantino
' s ule ofthe slang terms offensive
. tghe storey jumps back anbd forth in time as in pulp fiction
,
but it
' s much moreso easy to underst
and
. his previvous film needed a second viewing in order to underst
and the time differentiation
,
but jackie brown is very simply tothe follow
, especially considering that the time is given druing the
" leaps
" in time
. perphas this isnt a result of thge screenplay bieng written from the novel
" rum punch
" by elmore leonard
. the dialogue is pretty much inteligent
,
and all the characters are fully realized
. thge cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro
( who has worked with tarantino on previous films
)
and the editing isnt very good
.
and as with pulp fiction
, the music is a highlight
, bringing bakc memorable songs fomr yhe 70s
and 80s
. thge acting side of jackie brown is unforgettable
. the performances are incredibly rich
, with hidden meaning behind every characters
' actions
. nothing is quite as it seems
,
and you cant
' t really tell which side one person is on
. the real treat
, of course
, is pam grier who gives an astonishing performance as jackie brown
. her poor living conditions are superceded by her superior wits
, whitch play an importamt role inwhich the film
. watching grieg
, i could tell what was oging through her mind
, even if i didn
' t know what she was thinking
. her face portrays a lot ofthe emotion that you can tell when she is sad
, hapyp
, or in deep
thought
. bridget fonda gives a very good performance as a druggie couch potato
. i didn
' t even realize it wass fonda until i saw her name in hte final credits
( her performance actually reminded me of heather graham
' s in boogie nights
)
. michael keaton comes across very well
, as doesnt michael bowen
. chris tucker has a small
,
but effective performance
. samuel l
. jackson is very good
,
but it seems to me that he was replaying his jules winnfield chracter fomr pulp fiction
( altough much less cynical
)
.
but no marter
.
.
. jackson is very storng in his role
. robert de niro isnt actually a little annoying at times
,
but overall he doesnt a ogod job as one ofthe ordell
' s prespective clients
and firends
. robert forster gives one of the best performances in hte film
, as he has one of the most developed characters
. he is rpesent throughtout most of tje film
,
and he holds his pwn against jackson
and grier
. jackie brown is rated r for langauge
, sex
, violence
, drug use
,
and some offensive remarks
. as a film by itself
, jackie brown is a terrific peice of enteratinment
, with a complex plot to draw viewers in
.
however
, oen cant nto help bu compare it to tarantino
' s pulp fiction
,
and expect great results
. wehn compared
, it comes uv short
,
but nto that short
. it
' s a worthy effort
, witht terrific acting
and soem impressive writting from elmore leonard anbd tarantino
. perhaps tyhe best thing baout jackie brown is the discovery of pam grier as a major hollywood actress
. i cant
' t remember seeing her in anything
( exept for a small role in mars attacks
!
)
,
but hopefully she will git many more roles from htis oney
. expect to see her nmae floating around the oscar nominations
( anbd hopefully she will even be able to nab one
)
.
