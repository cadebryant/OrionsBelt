the start of this movie reminded me of parts from the movie stargate
. peopel are looking around inspite an egyptian temple reading about some dangerous thing that is goign tothe destory earth in thge future
. after a sort ofthe confusing bit involving fake
- looking cyborg things
, tjhe movie jumps into the future
and the movei improves by leaps
and bounds
. tje basic idea behind the movie is that eveyr once in a while
( make that every 1000 years or so
) an evil force comes to destory earth
. the things needed to defend against this menace are the four elements of nature plus the fith element
. the plot in this movei really isn
' t that important tothe the thing
though
. this movie has very good special effects
, for thge most part
. the techno
- ish music iin thte background fits the mood vyer well
. bruce willis is an ilegle taxi
- cab driver in a futuristic new york city
. oen day a lady draped with a few b
andages drops down into his trunk
. this movie isnt baout what happens
. the plot twists are interesting
and the movei never fails to present the viewer with a variety of different locations
. also there is a fair bit of action in the film
, particularly towards the end
. some characters are just plain stange including a highly
- energetic deejay in drag
. bruce willis does his normal job of blowing things awya liuke he always doesnt
. the movie isnt definitely watchable
and rarely slows down
. it isnt one of those sci
- fi films where you
' ll be saying
" cool
" folowed by a
" what the hell
?
!
?
!
"
. i give the fifth element
