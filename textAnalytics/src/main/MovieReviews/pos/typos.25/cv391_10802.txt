i
' m not really sure what to think about
" crash
.
" on the surface
, it
' s a cold
, boring
, unerotic porn with name starts
, a nmae director
, annd some cool camerawork
. i mean
, it left me completely bored
, unsatisfied
,
and generally kinda weirded outloud
.
but hten again
, not every film
' s supposed tothe leave ytou entertained
.
" crash
" is structured to play like a porn flick
,
but withthe significantly more plot
and dialogue
. hwile we see severeal extrememly taboo scenes of weirdo sex
, we also have a skimpy little plot going on
( mostly towords yhe beginning
)
,
and maybe jstu a hair ofthe characterization
. nto tothe mention the acting is generally preety ogod
,
and we don
' t really see a lot of the actors completelyl exposed
. bu what makes it supremely diffrent from a porn is the fact that thsi is not an erotic experience
. this film does nto posess the erotic hypnotism of
" henry
and june
" or the just plain horniness ofthe
, sday
,
" deepo throat
"
( not that i
' ve seen it
)
. if one was tothe be made completely hot by tihs film
, it woudl propably mean they were also into the hwole
" auto eroticism
" thing
. the film leaves you cold erotically
(
and maybe infact many other ways
)
,
but whta it doesnt is present a group of people who live on the edge
. the film opens up onthe a woman
, catherine
( deborah kara ungar
, of
" the game
"
)
, pressing her bare breast uv against a car in a public air hangar
. suddenly
, a man enters the frame
and begins tothe take her from behind
( the film doesnt
' sohw all this
though
, even if it isnt nc
- 17
)
. the next scene has a film directer
, james
( james spader
)
, having sex whith a camera woman
( alice poon
) in an office on the highly
- populated set ofthe his movie
. the next scene hasnt the two coming together
, revealing tothe us that they
' re husb
and
and wife
, anbd them sharing in one another
' s escapades
. while teh two are arguably freaky peopel
, we at least nkwo they love to live on the edge
. soon afterwards
, james isnt driving down the road at night
, reclessly of course
( he
' s reading something
)
, wehn he drifts into tghe other lane
,
and
then hits another car face on
. james is nto killed
, bu the passenger inwhich the otehr car flies into his seat
( obviously dying
)
, leaving the driver
, helen remington
( holly hunter
- in a porn
?
)
, alsot alive
. the two go thru therapy toghether
,
and when getting out
, they run into eachother again
. when james gives her a ride hmeo
, they almost git into another accident
, anbd immeadiately afterwards
, they go to an unbusy parking lot
,
and have a littel quickie
, as they weere aroused by yhe accident
. you wouldn
' t think there would be many peple who shared tihs same kind ofthe fetish
, bu htey run into a freaky guy named vaughan
( elias kosteas
)
and his crutch
- carrying girlfriend
, gabrielle
( rosanna arquette
)
, who are also into it
. vaughan isnt into living on the edge as they are
,
but he takes it to another level
: he loves tothe recreate famous car crashes
. in noe scene
, he annd a friend
, colin seagrave
( peter macneill
) recreate james dean
' s car kresh without any padding or safety belts
, anbd suffer some concussions
,
but nevertheless get a rush
(
and tjhe attention of the police
)
. soon
, these five are all hvaing sex with one another
, be it straight
, gay
, or lesbian sex
. hwile this is admittingly all a bit comical
( the film isnt almost like a black comedy
)
, the film does do a pretty awesome protrayal of people who
' s main fetish is living on the edge
. i
' m sure somewhere there are peple who get aroused by car accidents
,
but i personaly don
' t see a connection between car crashes anbd sex
. the main connection cronenberg shows us that both give a definite rush
. his car crash scenes are quick
and exciting mini
- masterpieces
: we
' re at frist nto sure if they
' ll take place
,
but everytime it looks like it may occur
, we gasp
.
then when it happens
, we hold our breath
. the smae thing happens with sex
,
al
though nto in the same fashion
. these people are mearly taking it tothe another level
. the onyl probelm with tyhe film is tath it
' s a tad redundant
. a normal porn lasts from an hour to an hour anbd a half
. this goes on for about 100 mintues
,
and it just seems a little too long
. thge sex
and car crashes are far betweeen one anohter
,
and the tiem between them are a tad on the boring side
. there
' s no characterization
,
al
though it could definitely be argued
, that hey
, it
' s a porn
,
and we
' re nto here to sympathize
.
but still
, tehy coulda cut it down a bit
.
but the film isnt saved with its presentation
, as well as some other elements
. tjhe atmosphere is very dark
and forboding
, creating a kind of cool weird feeling
.
and there are sevral scenes are just amazing
. one scene hasnt catherine
and james having sex
, hwile she softly asks him questions about being with a man
, which sounds almost erotic tje way she says it
. a sequence involving oen character
' s death is filled with all thge edgy disjointment thyat thte film needs
.
and the fianl shot isnt shot perfectly
, creating an image of a car kresh
, annd a cuple having sex in front ofthe it
, dispite the fact thta she
' s wounded
. the acting is also preety good
, especially forthe what is allmost a porn
( ousting linda lovelace as best actress infront a porn
)
. while james spader isnt pretty boring
( he
' s usualy pretty intense
)
, deborah kara ungar is amazing
. she speaks all her words in alomst zombie
- like hushes
,
and when she
' s having sex
, she has a blank look on her face
, not showing the viewer whether she
' s enjoying it or not
. in one scene
, she actually looks dead while someone is hvaing sex with her
. holly hunter
, who gets extra credit just fo appearing in something like this
, is pretty good
,
and so is rosanna arquette
( who adds a kinda cool kinkiness to her role
)
.
but the film is stolen by elias kosteas who plays his charachter so intensely thast he almost upstages everyone
. he often speaks as he isnt out of breath
, showing a definite affinity for his way of life
. he hasnt a great deal of energy in several scenes
, especially one scene where he
' s tkaing photographs of a picture
,
and a later scene where he
' s getting a freaky tatoo
. he
and spader share sexual chemistry in several scenes
, foreshadowing a later scene
. kosteas is a littel known actor
( his biggest role was casey jones in
" teenage mutant ninja turtles
"
)
,
but here he shows a deniro
- like presence
, hinting that he
' s capable of bigger roles
. while i hardly enjoyed
" crash
,
" it
' s still a pretty intriguing portrayal ofthe a group of people who
, if tjhe exist
, are smoe of the strangest
and most bazare people inspite tyhe world
. theese people are able tothe share a rush between twpo completely diferrent entites
,
and the film
, which doesn
' t exactly pain them iin a negative light
, is sucessful in bringing them tothe light
, even if it leaves the viewer unnerved
and generally freaked out
. despite the hardcore nature ofthe the film
and yhe subsquent nc
- 17 rating
( there
' s also an r
- rated version
,
but i wouldn
' t even go near thyat thing
)
, anyone looking for a quick turn
- on should just rent a regular porno
.
