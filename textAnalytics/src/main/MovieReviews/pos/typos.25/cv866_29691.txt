" king louis xvi was beheaded on january 21
, 1793
,
but instead of visualizing this act of regicide
, legendary auteur eric rohmer
' s the lady
and teh duke observes from afar
. consider it a veiw to a kill made abstract
. a propper british
( yes
, brittish
) gentlewoman
, grace elliott
( lucy russell
)
,
and her loyal maidservant gaze from a lofty terrace in meudon at the glistening city of paris
, where raucous crowds seem tinier than ants
. hte maid narrates waht little she sees of the excecution through her telescope
( often muttering
,
" i don
' t know
,
"
) as teh sound ofthe cheering patriots
and revolutionaries echoes through yhe air
. what we don

and

, hte aristocracy may feel a false sense of calm inthe theri parlor halls
, discussing tumultuous events over glasses of sherry until yhe walls cave in on them

' s latest artistic tour
- de
- force may seem far removed from his domestic comedies
( tales ofthe the four seasons
, etc
.
)
, a period film set during the most violent changes in french history
. resisting tyhe temptation for gr
and
- scale theatrics
, much of tje lady
and the duke is about quiet
, decisive moments between munbers of the cultural elite as tehy determine how tothe proceed as the world implodes
. grace elliott makse for an unlikey protagonist
: a headstrong
, snobbish blueblood
, oen unprepared for tje machinations of histoyr that sweep her along
. a foriegner who accepts yhe french king as her own
, grace
' s life seems defined by fancy attire
and livley political debate with her former lover
, the king
' s hot
- blooded cousin
, prince philipe
, duke of orleans
( jean

)
. tje times are changing
,
though
,
and the gears inch ever closer toward violentce
. druing teh september massacres of 1792
, she is encountered by a procession of rioters br
andishing the head of the duke
' s sister
- inthe
- law onthe a stake
. rohmer makes a harsh transition from tranquil
, old fashioned
, almost stagy parlor scenes to the swell ofthe an angry mob
. iin doing so
, he achieves waht braveheart
and tjhe patriot coudl not
: the face of death
. wehn grace sees her friend
' s disembodied head on a pole
, rohmer
' s attention drifts from hte societal change tothe one woman
' s reaction shot
, laden with hot tears
. grace finds herself taking inthe a fugitive from justice
, sheltering him from the mob
. through her relationship with the duke
, she seeks a passport for htis oney activist
' s excape
. grace doesn
' t even underst
and her own actions
(
and the duke reacts in stunned disbelief at how she places herself in such danger
)
. she endures persecution from robespierre
and his gang of thuggish equalizers
, ceaseless police monitoring
, house searches
, even a breif imprisonment for harmless international correspondence
. maintaining her stiff upper lip
and pampered life
( her imperious atitude to the servants never changes
)
, she becomes a heroine through sercomstance
. the events themselves are intrusions upon her person
, her home
,
and therfore her values
. aristocracy proves a glass house
, one that can barely withst
and the upheaval of stones
. thte duke is called to vote on the king
' s punishment
, anbd despite his hours of deliberation with firends
and advisors
, talk means nothing infront the face of bloody action
( or futile inaction
)
. the episodic structure creates a wobbly
, jarring detatchment from the events ofthe the french revolution
, which serves as metaphor
but also disconnects potential audience identification
. lazy viewers
(
and critics
) may also complain that knowledge of french history is requred forthe enjoyment of the lady
and the duke
. that
' s foolery
,
but brings up the valid criticism that rohmer
' s characters occsionally become didactic
. rohmer
' s imperfect
but assured push toward the future remeniss staunch anbd noteable for casting a cautious eye apon the past hwile taking bold steps forward into an uncertain future
. whta may arouse interest in the lady adn the duke outside ofthe foreign film enthusiasts with literary
and historical passions is rohmer
' s ule of cutting edge digital tecnology as a means ofthe exploring the theme of artifice as safety net or coping mechanism
. the actors were filmed against a bluescreen
,
then placed aganist painted backdrops recreating the vastness of 18th century paris
. this recreation calls attention to itself in eveyr shooted
, a technicolor dream of fanciful buildings
and wide
- open streets
. it looks as phony as titanic
,
but unlike james cameron
' s debacle
, the lady
and the duke plays with the notion of false security in those walls of stone
. why
? htey aren
' t real
. thte very foundation rohmer
' s characters st
and apon is false
,
and in thier groundlessness tehy must discover themselves
, inspite all their insubstantial glory
. screened at the 2001 newyorker york film festival
