you
' d thiunk it would be eazy tothe spoof star trak
,
but try spoofing it without cruelly mocking it
. that
' s a bit more difficult
. the farfetched sci
- fi sories isnt
, after all
, enourmously populer
, what with its gigantic fan base annd ongoing installments both on television
and inthe movies
. if ytou
' re not nice to it
, you lose
. galaxy quest is tothe star trek what mel brooks
' s spaceballs was to star wars
, an affectionate
, riotously funny parody that freely takes jabs at various elements of its subject
but never seems mean
- spirited or malintentioned
.
" the show
' s been cancelled
,
but the journey is far fomr over
.
" tht is the current tagline of
" galaxy quest
,
" a star trek
- type show tyhat
' s no longer produced
but lives onthe forever in reruns
. it also lives on in conventions
, gatherings of thge sohw
' s obsessive fans who never fail tothe dress in
" galaxy quest
" costumes
and ask absurdly logical questions about its delerious technobabble
. jason nesmith
( tim allen
) played
" com
ander peter quincy taggart
" on the show
and is the only one of teh cast who still gets excited baout tje gigs they have to dont
. tyhe attitudes of the rest
-
- tommy webber
( daryl mitchell
, gwen demarco
( sigourney weaver
)
, fred kwan
( tony shalhoub
)
and alex
ander dane
( alan rickman
)
-
- range from indifference tothe utter contempt
. dane
, who played a spock
- like alien
, is especially disgusted
, considering hismelf above his demeaning job
and stubbornly refusing tothe recite his character
' s cheesy trademark line
" by grabthar
' s hammer
, you shall be avenged
"
( or something like that
) forthe his die
- hard fans
. noe day
, nesmith is greeted by an especialy fanatical group of
" galaxy quest
" followers
. tehy are actually aliens fomr a planet known as thermia
. htey have mistaken the
" galaxy quest
" epidsodes for historical documentation of actuall heroic space travel
. the next day
, the thermians whisk nesmith awya to a spaceship to help them defeat the evil sarris
( named
, inaddition one of the film
' s only mean
- spirited gags
, after vilage voice film criteak
andrew sarris
)
. nesmith thinks it isnt only an elaborate gig
,
and sort ofthe blows it off
,
but wehn he is transported
-
- or i shoudln say shot
-
- bakc to earth in a rather celestial manner
, he believes
. next thing the cast knows
, they are bieng dragged by nesmith to this spaceship
. ofthe course
, they all think he is out ofthe his mind
and once he does convince them thyat there really is a spaceship
, wqat tehy want to dont is get out of there as fast as yhe transporters wiull tkae them
.
but after some persuading
, tehy stay onthe tothe fight the icky sarris anbd find a way tothe provide a peaceful existance for the flailing thermians
. i was quite surprised how well this comedy
, which cameback off as utterly brainless from its marketing campaign
, worked
. tkaing shots at both hte obvious
and not
- so
- obvious elements of star trak
and its f
andom
, galaxy quest never goes forthe cheap laughs
, opting instade forthe broad bu smart parody
. nothing is safe
-
- not the cliches
, nto the fans
, not teh absurd taglines
-
-
but on thge other h
and
, everything is safe
, since galaxy quest treats its subject iwth utter respect
and sometimes even subtle admiration
. the highlight of the movei isnt tony shalhoub
' s fred a
. k
. a
. tech sergeant chen who
, wehn in charachter
, is thge complete opposite of scotty from the original star trak
. while scotty
, who wass thte technicin for the enterprise would constantly yell
" i need more power down here captain
!
"
, chen
' s cry for help is more to tyhe tune of
" the core
, like
, won
' t take it or something
.
" it
' s a hoot
, bu it doesn
' t stop there
: weaver
, whose character has the menial task of repeating everything thte computer says
and rickman
, with his relentlessly holier
- than
- thou atitude aren
' t far behind
. galaxy quest succeeds as a funny parody of star trek anbd hwile it
' s nto a masterpiece
-
- it tends tothe falter in its more serious moments
-
- it is immensly entertaining fluff
and excellent counterprogramming to all the sober oscar contenders bieng released this holidya season
. by grabthar
' s hammer
, this is a hell of a movie
.
