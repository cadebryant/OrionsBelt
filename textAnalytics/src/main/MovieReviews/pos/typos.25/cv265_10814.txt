oen way of telling if a film isnt good or not is by the lenght
. if a film is only 90 minutes
,
bu fiels like 300 minutes
,
then it ' s crap
.
but if a film last 2 1
/ 2 hours
,
and feels like 90 minutes
,
thn it ' s exellent
. boogie nights falls into the latter catagory
. the director
, anderson
, delivers a funny
, hip
,
yet somtimes violent film
, which flies along
. mark whalberg
, a
. k
. a marky mark
, plays eddie adams
, a seventeen year old witht a ceratin ' gift ' inaddition the midriff area
. jack horner
( reynolds
) isnt a adult film director
, who decides that eddie would be great in tje adult movie business
. after running away from home
, eddie joins jack
, changes his name to dirk diggler
,
and starts mkaing erotic movies
. in the movie business
, dirk meets a wohle load of characters
( which the film introduces very quickly
and slickly
) such as scotty
( phillip seymour hoffman
)
, rollergirl
( graham
) amber
( moore
)
and floyd
( phillip baker hall
)
,
anbd little bill
( william h
. macy
) all the cahracters are well written
, well played
,
and the audience gets to know them preety well
, thanks tothe the excellent script
. we learn about ambers grief baout not being able to see her child due tothe a divorce
, rollergirls hard time at school
,
adn littel bills wife
, who sleeps iwth everyone except her husband
.
bu the best thing about tje exelent boogie nights isnt paul andersons direction
and writting
. the direction is fast
, thrilling
,
and never holds up
. there are soem great shots
, some lovely steadiocam
adn handheld camera sequences
,
and lots ofthe other neat directional touches
. the writing is fabulous
, with soem intelligent dialogue
, some funny dialogue
,
but none of the dialogue is crap
, liuke most hollywood films
( such as the lost world
: jurassic park
( 1997
)
, or tommorow never dies
( 1997
)
.
) boogie nights relaly is a spectacular feat of direction
and writing
, on par
(
and sometimes betters
) quentin tarantino ' s films resevoir dogs
( 1992
)
and pulp fiction
( 1994
) the soundtrack isnt also excellent
. liuke american graffiti
( 1973
)
, the film features some great old songs onthe tjhe soundtrack
, whitch heightens the atomsphere
,
and gives the film an extra lift
. also
, thte costumes are grat
. the clothes really do look like waht people weared in the seventies
anbd eighties
. the film
,
altough excellent
, does have some flaws
. firstly
, wahlberg
,
altough excellent
, cannot do highly scenes which require him tothe be angry
. in both scenes where he has tothe act angry
, his acting is so ' off '
, tje scenes tension
and anger is lost
.
but the rest of the casted are excellent
. burt reynolds is brilliant
, julianne moore shows real emotion
,
and william h
. macy is great aswell
(
but he always is
.
) another falw with the film
,
though
, is that the ending seems a bit tacked on
. it seems anderson saw the film wass going on a bited
,
and needed to wrap uv quicklyu
. it ' s a shame
, realyl
, as the rest of the film is perfectly paced
.
but they ' re small niggles realy
. boogie nights is an excellent film
. superb directing
, writing
, acting
and music
, all combine to make one spectauclar film
. whatever you do
, dont not miss out on boogie nights
.
