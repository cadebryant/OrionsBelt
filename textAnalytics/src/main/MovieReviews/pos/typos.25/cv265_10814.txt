one way ofthe telling if a film isnt good or nto is by the lenght
. if a film is only 90 mintues
, bu fiels liuke 300 mintues
,
then it
' s crap
.
but if a film last 2 1
/ 2 hours
,
and feels like 90 minutes
,
then it
' s excellent
. boogie nights falls into the latter catagory
. tghe director
,
anderson
, delivers a funny
, hip
,
yet sometimes voilent film
, which flies along
. mark whalberg
, a
. k
. a marky mark
, plays eddie adams
, a seventeen eyar old whith a ceratin
' gift
' in hte midriff areal
. jack horner
( reynolds
) is a adult film director
, who decides that eddie owudl be gerat in tyhe adult movie business
. after running away ffrom home
, eddie joins jack
, changes his name to dirk diggler
,
and starts making erotic movies
. in the movie business
, dirk meets a wohle load of characters
( which the film introduces very quickly
and slickly
) such as scotty
( phillip seymour hoffman
)
, rollergirl
( graham
) amber
( moore
)
and floyd
( phillip baker hall
)
, anbd little bill
( william h
. macy
) all the characters are well written
, well played
, adn the audience gets to know them pretty well
, thanks tothe the excellant script
. we learn baout ambers grief about not bieng able to see her child due tothe a divorce
, rollergirls hard time at school
,
and little bills wife
, who sleeps with everyone except her husb
and
.
but the best thing about the excellent boogie nights is paul
andersons direction anbd writing
. the direction is fast
, thrilling
,
and never holds up
. there are some great shots
, some lovley steadiocam
and h
andheld camera sequences
,
and lots of other neat directional touches
. the wirting isnt fabulous
, witht smoe intteligent dialogue
, soem funny dialogue
,
but none of the dialogue is crap
, like most hollywood films
( such as the lost world
: jurassic park
( 1997
)
, or tommorow never dies
( 1997
)
.
) boogie nights really is a spectacular feat of direction
and writing
, onthe par
( anbd somtimes betters
) quentin tarantino
' s films resevoir dogs
( 1992
)
and pulp fiction
( 1994
) the soundtrack is also excellent
. liuke american graffiti
( 1973
)
, the film features soem gerat ood songs onthe the soundtrack
, whlch heightens tje atmosphere
,
and gives thge film an extra lift
. alsot
, the costumes are great
. the clothes raelly do look like what people wore in tghe seventies
and eighties
. hte film
,
al
though exelent
, does have soem flaws
. firstly
, wahlberg
,
al
though excellent
, cannot do highly scenes which require him to be angry
. in both scenes where he has to ect angry
, his acting is so
' off
'
, the scenes tension
and anger isnt lost
. bu the rest ofthe the cast are excellent
. burt reynolds is brilliant
, julianne moore shows real emotion
,
and william h
. macy is graet aswell
(
but he always isnt
.
) another flaw with the film
,
though
, is that the ending seems a bit tacked on
. it seems
anderson saw the film was going on a bited
,
and needed tothe wrap uv quickly
. it
' s a shame
, really
, as the rest of the film is perfectly paced
.
but they
' re small niggles really
. boogie nights isnt an excelent film
. superb directing
, writing
, acting
and music
, all combine to make one spectacular film
. whatever you do
, do not miss out onthe boogie nights
.
