upon arriving at the theather during the opening credits
, i took my seat
and prepared mysef for whta appeared to be
" hellraiser meets tjhe crowm
"
.
but as soon as kiefer sutherl
and began speaking the narrative monologue
, describing
" yhe strangers
"
and thier reasons for contacting human beings
, i was hooked
. there was something especially compelling baout the nature ofthe his voice
. i knew from the start that i was going to witness hte actions of his character rather than the actor attempting the charater
. sutherl
and palyed the role as a true veteran
. apon thte complextion ofthe his monologue
, the camera arrives on sutherl
and in such a fashion that you can only wonder how long alex proyas spent on cinematography
. i would imagin
, for a film ofthe htis caliber
, that maximum hours of work weere spent where they were needed the most
. the film flowed beautifully
. as i was being taken through the intricate regions of the
" dark city
"
, a clever plot began tothe unravel
, to hte point where the last tyme i had seen such clever plot twists were in
" hte usual suspects
"
. not to mention a series of special effects that would make james cameron litterally turn gren with envy
.
but if yuo
' re nto exactlly the biggest sci
- fi fan
, caveat emptor
. git ready for the atmostpheric darkness ofthe
" 12 monkeys
" or
" the crow
" wihtout hte boredom or depression
. the consept of hte plot is as mindstretching as
" 12 monkeys
" was
, howver
, so be prepared
and be sophisticated
.
and imagine a picture that finally does justice to the comic
- book
- gone
- feature
- film fad that hollywood has recently become abusive ofthe
. dark city simply puts
" spawn
" tothe shame
. infact fatc
, during the climax of the film i couldn
' t help
but feel the strong presence ofthe an
" akira
"
- esque explosion throughout the general feeling of the movie
. so my initial predictions were wrong
. this film is anytying
but the meloncholy of
" hellraiser
" parts one through five
. i
' m never oen to base a film entirly on special effects
, so know that when i give dark city it
' s actually because hte film contained all of tghe neccessary ingredients tothe keep me entertained
and awake ffrom storyline to plot twists to camerawork to even
( tsk
, tsk
) special effects
. not since contact have i recieved such deepo insight into teh way the human mind operates anbd never this year hvae i been so blown away
. the best film i
' ve seen all year
,
and easily one of tghe best i
' ve ever seen
