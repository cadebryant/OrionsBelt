upon arriving at the theater during the opening credits
, i took my seat
adn prepared mysef fo what appeared tothe be
" hellraiser meets the crow
"
.
bu as soon as kiefer sutherland began speaking the narrative monologue
, describing
" the strangers
"
and their reasons for contacting human beings
, i ws hooked
. ther was something especially compelling about hte nature ofthe his voice
. i knew from the strat that i was going tothe witness tjhe actions of his character rather than the actor attempting the charactor
. sutherland played the role as a true veteran
. apon the complextion of his monologue
, tjhe camera arrives on sutherland in such a fashon thgat you can only wonder how long alex proyas spent on cinematography
. i would imagine
, for a film ofthe this caliber
, that maximum hours of work were spent where they were needed the most
. the film flowed beautifully
. as i ws being taken through the intricate regions of the
" dark city
"
, a clever plot began tothe unravel
, to thge point where tyhe lastest tiem i had seen such clever plot twists were in
" hte usual suspects
"
. not to mention a series of spacial effects that would make james cameron litterally turn green with envy
.
but if you ' re not exactly the biggest sci
- fi fan
, caveat emptor
. get ready for the atmostpheric darkness ofthe
" 12 monkeys
" or
" the crow
" without the boredom or depression
. tyhe concept of tje plot is as mindstretching as
" 12 monkeys
" was
,
however
, so be prepared
and be sophisticated
.
anbd imagine a picture that finally does justice to the comic
- book
- gone
- feature
- film fad that hollywood has recently become abusive of
. dark city simply puts
" spawn
" to shame
. infront fact
, during the climax ofthe the film i couldn ' t help
but efel the strong presence of an
" akira
"
- esque explosion througout the general feeling of the movie
. so my inital predictions were wrong
. this film is anything
but the meloncholy of
" hellraiser
" parts one thru five
. i ' m never one tothe base a film entirly on special effects
, so nkow that when i give dark city it ' s actually becasue the film contained all of tjhe neccessary ingredients tothe keep me entertained
and awake from storyline to plot twists to camerawork to even
( tsk
, tsk
) special effects
. not since contact have i recieved such deep insight inot the way the human mind operates
and never this year have i been so blown away
. the best film i ' ve seen all year
,
and easily one of the best i ' ve ever seen
