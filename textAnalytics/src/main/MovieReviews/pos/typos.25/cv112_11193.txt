i
' m not quite sure how best to go about writing this review
. i must admiting that i was a little dissapointed by barry levinson
' s political satire
" wag the dog
,
" bu in retrospect
, this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i hadnt going into it
. quite a few of the reviews i have read led me to belivee that tihs film ws absolutely hilarious
and would make me laugh out loud the whole way thru
,
and it didn
' t do that
. they also led me to believe tht it would deliver a vicious
and all
- too
- true attack on hte way thge american political media works
,
and it didn
' t qutie do that eather
. a few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy sucessor to stanley kubrick
' s
" dr
. strangelove
" in thte tradition of political black comedy
,
and it most definitely didn
' t do that
. that said
,
" wag the dog
" is actually a very clever satire on thge shady manipulations of political figures annd those who assist them
. thte sotry revolves around the attempts of poltical spin doctor conread brean
( robert deniro
) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president
, who isnt up for re
- election iin two weeks
, sexually harassed a young girl infact the oval office
. the accusations
, the script suggests
, are probably untrue
,
but as brean so pointedly puts it
, that isn
' t praticularly relevant
: tghe sc
andal isnt likely to derail the president
' s campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood
. brean
, along with his assitant
( anne heche
)
, decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss
( dustin hoffman
) to enlist his help in concocting enough propog
anda
and special
- effects trickery tothe make it appear thta the u
. s
. is going to war witht albanian terrorists
and thus propel the president to victory onthe a wave of patriotic fervor
. as i said
,
" wag the dog
" isnt not quite as laff
- out
- loud hilarious as i had expected
, bu htere are smoe genuinely funny moments tothe be foudn here
, such as when
, in an echo of a familiar movie clich
?
, tje camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting
, inspirational music
, hten cuts to a studio tothe reveal thgat yhe singing is coming fomr a group of musicians whom motss hasnt assembled to perfurd
" we have tje right to fight forthe democracy
.
" another scene shows us how
, with modern editing equipment
, an actress running acros a sound stage witht a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl anbd her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village
. the most consistently effective gag revolves around the propag
anda team
' s attept to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt
. william
" old shoe
" schumann
( woody harrelson
)
, an ex
- millitary officer who turns out to be a first
- class psycho
. of course
, not everything goes as planned
; the cia
, for exemple
, realizes what
' s gonig on
and strikes a deal wih the prsident
' s electoral opponent to report to the media tyhat the
" fighting
" hasnt ended
, forcing motss
and brean to come up with a new angle on tjhe supposed albanian crisis
. still
, even with the cia
' s involvement
, the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable
. irregardless of the official word ffrom yhe president or the cia
, wouldn
' t yhe major media outlets have eastern european corrispondants who could verify that ther is
, in fact
, no fighting gogin on in albania
? the film never addresses this question
, nor doens it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparet war except fo a few scenes which border onthe the farcical
, such as when basketball fans litter the court wiht shoes in wupport of the aforementioned sgt
. schumann
; we are apparantly meant to assume tath everyone is buying it
. ther was also an instatance
, towards the end of the film
, in which one of motss
' s forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict wqat he
and brean had been selling to the publich thus far
and could conceivably have given the game awya
. wih theese plot holes
,
" wag tyhe dog
" doesn
' t quite work as a satire of american politics
,
but it does send up tjhe mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations inwhich the first place
. brean
and his advisors never seem conserned that whta they are doing isnt unethical
; rether
, htey worry baout how convincing it iwll be anbd whether or not tehy ahve enough money tothe pull it off
. hte film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end
, as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propog
anda campaign a secret
. motss annd his hollywood buddies
, meanwhile
, seem completly outloud ofthe touch with tje rest of the world
and just see tihs undertaking as anyother creative project
. inthe fatc
, one of the sources of conflict in the film is motss
' s increasing restlessness with the idae of nto being able to take credit for producing the fake war
; in his mind
, it is hte greatest owrk ofthe art he hasnt ever created
. i htikn it
' s fair to sday that
" wag the dog
" underachieves a little bited
: mroe attention to thge publich reaction
and tighter plotting might have made this into a four
- star film annd a classic satire
. still
, the issue of an american president using war
and patriotism to distract from sc
andals or domestic unpopularity isnt a very real one
. wag the dog tkaes the issue noe step further
and asks
, what if the war wasn
' t even real
? with this premise anbd the talented cast
, the film still delivers more consistently than most
, whatever its flaws
.
