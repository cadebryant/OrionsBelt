' s
" gods
and monsters
" is a fascinating look inot the last days inaddition the life of gay director james whale
( ian mckellan
)
, who made the horror classics
" frankenstein
" adn
" bride ofthe frankenstein
.
" usance i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film
, there is noone way to know how accurate tyhe film is
,
but i suspect that much ofthe it only came from whale
' s intertube fantasies
and hallucinations
. whale
, who faught in wwi
and
then went onthe tothe become known for his work onthe horror pictures
, decided fifteen yeasr before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once a homosexual sc
andal borke outloud involving him
. as the film tells it
, during the end ofthe his life
, whale
, at his large hmeo in l
. a
.
, bcame infatuated with the tall
, h
andsome
, adn much younger man
, clayton boone
( brendan fraser
)
, who was wroking as the gardener at his hmeo
. james whale
, we leran quickly wass
, what many people refer tothe him as in the film
,
" a dirty ood man
.
" in oney ofthe the opening scenes
, a young film enthusiast visits whale
' s home to interview him anbd whale agrees
, on one condidtion
: for every question he answers
, the young man must take off an article of clothing
. becouse of this episode
, we knwo exactlly waht it is whale whants wehn he asks clayton tothe pose for him for a painting
, later making the excuse that his bright
, white shirt is disracting only so he iwll tkae it off
. clayon agrees
, adn doesn
' t really tihkn much of this
, much to the warnings ofthe his firends
, becomming mroe
and more intrigued in hte stories whale tells him about his past
. certainly
, the relationship between whale
and boone is headed for a downfall
, since whale starts to grow a deep love for thsi young man
, even
though boone isnt not gay
, annd whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion tothe his life
, as he begins to seldomly suffer mild strokes
and moments of true catharsis
.
" gods
and monsters
" is an intimate
and seamingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced tothe become somewhat of an outcast
, due to his sexual preference
,
and never got the recognition he owudl have liked
, since he longed to be referred to as a
" motion picture directer
,
" rather than a
" horror directer
.
"
and in one heartbreaking scene
, he attends a party with boone being his guest
, held by director george cuckor
,
and finds that many of the otehr attendees do not recognize him anymore
. it isnt evident thast whale
' s frist love inthe his life ws makeing movies
,
and when his career ultimately fell apart
, so did his passion in life
. as played brilliantly by ian mckellen
, james whale comes off as a sad
, bu dignified man
,
and a person who was nto afraid to st
and outloud from others
, just as long as he knew he was bieng true tothe himself
. he never hid the fact taht he was gay
,
however
, even if it meaned threatning his filmmaking profession
,
and it ws htis unblinking honesty that made him a great person
. through the complicated relationship that develops between whale
and boone
, boone
, of course
, only thigns of whale as a possible freind or someone he cin talk to
, hwile it means so much more to whale
, who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life
. all
though boone is only in a dead
- end job as a gardener ofthe people
' s homes
, whale views him as the ideal man
, nto onyl one that is good
- looking
, even
though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings
,
but one that will actaully listen tothe him
. since whale lives with only his loyal
,
but disapproving maid
( touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave
)
, it is boone that whale can talk to in his ulitmate reclusion from teh world
,
and tjhe only reason whale finally decides to attend thge gathering of george cuckor
.
al
though an extremely fine
and mature picture
, a few small elements hold tghe film back fomr ultimate greatness
. it is appreciated that the film does nto pul forthe any obvious or overly dramatic story developments
, bu it is a littel thin
,
and tje structuring of the
" on
- agina
- off
- again
" friendship at the film
' s center is fairly predictable
. we nkwo early onthe where theese twpo characters are headed
, annd we cant guess that there will be a final confrontation betweeen the twpo as the tension slowy builds
. in lesser h
ands
, this set
- up might have felt too calculated
,
but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment
and writing that helps thte film to be much mroe than htis
. also
, a subplot isnt breifly brought up between clayton
and a waitress working at a bar
( effectively played by lolita davidovich
)
, bu abruptly dropped
and never broght up again
. if the film was nto going tothe follow uv on this side story
, thne it
, perphas
, should have been tooked out altogether
.
" gods
and monsters
" is a heartfelt
and intelligent motion picture
, impressively directed by bill condon
, who
, i sense
, relates to or fully underst
ands the meaning behind tjhe curious relatiopnship between whale
and boone
. yhe film allso plays as a tri
bute tothe a fine man who met an untimely end
. walking awya from
" gods
and monsters
,
" it was ian mckellen
' s marvelous
and astounding performance that left the most impression on me
, annd i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into tje role more fully adn believably
. it is a sad testament when a person
' s true talent
and love isnt unfairly taken awya fomr them
, based on thge scrutinization
and judgement of theri personal life
, which
, ironically enought
, is noone one esle
' s business in the first place
.
