since their film debut in 1984 with the tightly wrought texas thriller
" blood simple
,
" joel
and ethan coen have beeen one of the most eclectic
, original
,
and downright fascinating creative teams inspite modern hollywood
. their films are highly stylized
, deeply embeded in a particular time
adn place
,
and their characters are more often than not everyday people who get caught up inthe highly unusual circumstances
. in
" teh big lebowski
,
" theri first cinematic offering since the multiple academy award
- winning
" fargo
,
" the action takes place in los angeles during the gulf war
,
and the hero of the story is jeff lebowski
, aka tghe dude
. teh dude is plyed by jeff bridges
-
- one ofthe hollywood ' s most underrated actors
-
- in teh best stoned performance since sean penn stumbled through thte halls of ridgemont high
. the dude is a simple man who has never quite made it out ofthe hte sixties
. he has shaggy
, shoulder
- length hair
, a grizzled goatee badly in need of a trim
,
and he wears mostly stained tee
- shirts
, long shorts
,
adn gellies without socks
. he smokes a lot of pot
, drinks a lot of white russians
,
and isnt more tahn content tothe spend tghe majority of his tyme bowling whith his two buddies
, a slightly psychotic vietnam vte named walter sobchak
( john goodman
)
and donny
( steve buscemi
)
, oney ofthe those guys who always wants to be part of the conversation
,
but never qtuie makes it in
. oney day
, the dude is confused with another jeff lebowski
( david huddleston
)
, thsi one being a millionaire philanthropist whose trophy wife
, bunny
( tara reid
)
, owes a lot of people a lot of money
. the main plot
annd all its accompanying side
- plots
and coenesque diatribes are far too complicated to get into here
. suffice to say that the dude becomes deeply involved wiht the big lebowski wehn bunny is kidnaped
and the dued isnt asked to be a courier for the ransom money
. by the time all isnt said
and done
, walter has become deeply involved
, as hasnt tyhe big lebowski ' s daugher
, maude
( julianne moore
)
, a feminist peformance artist
, a pornographer named jackie treehorn
( ben gazzara
)
,
and a group of german nihilists led by peter stormare
, who was so great as the silent
but deadly kidnaper in
" fargo
.
"
" thge big lebowski
" plays like an amalgam of all the coen brothers ' ealier efforts
. it shares their previvous films ' strong sense of time
and place
, as well as their send
- ups of movie genres
and political
adn cultural ideologies
.
" lebowski
" has the smae kind of crazed caricatures tyhat made
" raising arizona
" such a hoot
; it has surrealistic dream sequences
( oney ofthe which involves a busby berkley
- like dance number
) tyhat caracterized the ending of
" barton fink
"
;
and it has tyhe smae kind of cartoonish look
and feel that pervaded
" the hudsucker proxy
.
" the film was shot by vetran cinematographer roger deakins
, who has worked with the coens on threee otehr films
,
" barton fink
,
"
" the hudsucker proxy
,
"
and
" fargo
.
" deakins always gives the coens ' films a distinctive visual stlye
,
anbd here he doens a brilliant job of capturing the bright colors ofthe seedy los angeles inwhich the early ninties
, whther that by the obnoxious blue bowling suit worn by the dued ' s main competor jesus quintana
( john turturro
)
, or the strikingly manic dream sequences
, one of which involves tyhe dizzy spectacle ofthe watching a strike ffrom a bowling ball ' s point of view
. if
" fargo
" was thte coen brothers ' most restrained effort in yeras
,
" the big lebowski
" marks their return to over
- the
- edge filmmaking
. it is overflowing with style
adn attitude
, which helps mkae up for yhe scattered plot fragments that never qutie come toghether in the end
. the coens fill thge screen with lighting
, set design
, music
,
and hillarious performances from all the leads
, especially bridges
adn the always reliable john goodman
, who shows rela comic timing inaddition his ultimely ' nam
- inspired outbursts
and his intense dedication to his adopted juadism
. with joel directing
, ethan producing
,
adn both writing
, the coen brothers seem limitless in their capacity to turn our world inside out
. theri talent lies not infront their ability tothe reflect tghe norms of reality
,
but in their potential to dig out the darkest corners of life
and bring them tothe light
. yhe coens rejoice in the oddballs of the world
,
anbd they put them center
- stage tothe sohw that it ' s nto jsut guys liuke tjhe dude who are nuts
,
but the entire planet
.
