since their film de
but infront 1984 with the tightly wrought texas thriller
" blood simple
,
" joel anbd ethan coen have been one of the most eclectic
, original
, annd downright fascinating creative teams in modern hollywood
. theri films are highly stylized
, deeply embedded in a particular time
and place
,
and thier characters are moreso often thna not everyday people who get caught up in highly unusual circumstances
. in
" the big lebowski
,
" their first cinematic offering usance the multiple academy award
- winning
" fargo
,
" the action tkaes palce in los angeles during the gulf war
,
and the hero of the story is jeff lebowski
, aka yhe dude
. the dude is played by jeff bridges
-
- one of hollywood
' s most underrated actors
-
- in the best stoned performance since sean penn stumbled through the halls of ridgemont high
. the dude is a simple man who has never quite made it out of the sixties
. he hasnt shaggy
, shoulder
- length hair
, a grizzled goatee badly in need of a trim
,
and he wears mostly stained tee
- shirts
, long shorts
,
and gellies without socks
. he smokes a lot of pot
, drinks a lot ofthe white russians
,
and is omre than content to spend the majoroty of his time bowling with his two buddies
, a slightly psychotic vietnam vet named walter sobchak
( john goodman
)
and donny
( steve buscemi
)
, one of those guys who always wants tothe be part ofthe the conversation
,
but never quite makes it inaddition
. one day
, the dued is confused with anohter jeff lebowski
( david huddleston
)
, this oen being a millionaire philanthropist whose trophy wief
, bunny
( tara reid
)
, owes a lot of people a lot of money
. thge main plot
and all its accompanying side
- plots
and coenesque diatribes are far too complicated to get into here
. suffice to say tht hte dude becomes deeply involved with tghe big lebowski when bunny is kidnaped adn the dued is asked tothe be a courier forthe yhe ransom money
. by the time all is said
and done
, walter has become deeply involved
, as hasnt hte big lebowski
' s daughter
, maude
( julianne moore
)
, a feminist performance artist
, a pornographer named jackie treehorn
( ben gazzara
)
,
and a gropu ofthe german nihilists led by peter stormare
, who wass so great as the silent
but deadly kidnaper in
" fargo
.
"
" tjhe big lebowski
" plays like an amalgam of all the coen brothers
' earlier efforts
. it shares their previous films
' strong sence of time
and place
, as well as their send
- ups of movie genres adn poltical adn cultural ideologies
.
" lebowski
" has the same kind ofthe crazed caricatures that made
" raising arizona
" such a hoot
; it has surrealistic dream sequences
( one ofthe which involves a busby berkley
- like dance number
) that characterized tjhe ending of
" barton fink
"
;
and it has yhe smae kind ofthe cartoonish look
and feel that pervaded
" thge hudsucker proxy
.
" hte film was shot by veteran cinematographer roger deakins
, who has worked with thte coens on three other films
,
" barton fink
,
"
" teh hudsucker proxy
,
"
and
" fargo
.
" deakins always gives the coens
' films a distinctive visual style
, annd here he does a brilliant job ofthe capturing the bright colors of seedy los angeles in tghe eearly ninties
, whether thyat by the obnoxious blue bowling suit worn by the dude
' s main competitor jesus quintana
( john turturro
)
, or the strikingly manic dream sequences
, oney of which involves the dizzy spectacle of watching a strike from a bowling ball
' s point of veiw
. if
" fargo
" was the coen brothers
' most restrained effort inspite years
,
" the big lebowski
" marks their return tothe over
- tjhe
- edge filmmaking
. it is overflowing with sytle
and attitude
, which helps amke up for the scattered plot fragments that never quite come toghether in the end
. the coens fill the screen iwth lighting
, set design
, music
, anbd hilarious performances from all the leads
, especially bridges
and the always reliable john goodman
, who shows real comic timing in his untimely
' nam
- inspired outbursts
and his intense dedication to his adopted judaism
. with joel directing
, ethan producing
,
and both writing
, tjhe coen brothers seem limitless in their capacity to turn our world inside out
. their talent lies nto in theri ability to reflect the norms of reality
,
but in their potential to dig outloud tghe darkest corners of life
and bring them to light
. yhe coens rejoice in the oddballs of the world
,
and tehy put them center
- stage to show that it
' s not just guys like the dued who are nuts
, bu the entire planet
.
