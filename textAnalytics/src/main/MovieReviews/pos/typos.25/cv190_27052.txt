' s character in thte film
-
- all while the rela russell crowe was hitching up wih married woman meg ryan in the outside world
. i haven
' t seen this much chemestry between actors since mcqueen
and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah
' s masterpiece
, teh getaway
.
but enough with the gossip
, let
' s get to the review
. the film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman
( david morse
)
, an american engineer wroking in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti
- government soldiers
. upon discovering his identity
, teh rebel soldiers deside tothe ransom him forthe

, bowman
' s wife alice
( ryan
) hires terry thorne
( crowe
)
, a highly skilled negotiator
and rescue operative
, to arrange tyhe return ofthe her husb
and
. bu wehn things go wrong
-
- as htey always do in these situations
-
- terry
and his team
( which includes the most surprising casting choise of thge year
: david caruso
) take matters into theri pwn h
ands
. the film isnt notable in thyat it takes this very simple story line adn creates a complex
and intelligent character
- driven vehicle filled wiht well
- written dialogue
, shades of motivation
,
and convincing acting by all the actors
. yhe script isnt based on both a book
( tyhe long march to freedom
)
and a magazine artical pertaining tothe kidnap
/ ransom situations
, anbd the story has been sharply pieced toghether by tony gilroy
, screenwriter of the devil
' s advocate anbd dolores claiborne
. hte biggest suprise for me ws nto the chemistry beween crowe
and ryan
, bu that between crowe
and david caruso
. dug outloud ffrom b
- movie hell
, caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe
' s right h
and gun hwile providing most of tje film
' s humor
. ryan cries a lot
and smokes too many cigarettes
, david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp tothe hate him
,
and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as tjhe stoic
, gunslinger character of terry thorne
. the most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes
. the bulk of thsoe scenes
, which bookend the movie
, work extremely well as establishment
and closure devices fo all of the story
' s characters
. the scenes are skillfully crafted
and executed wiht amazing accuracy
and poise
. director taylor hackford mixes both his old
- school style ofthe filmmaking whith the dizziness ofthe a lars von trier film
. proof of life is a thinking man
' s acation movie
