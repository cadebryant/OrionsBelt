stendhal
' s syndrome
: a condidtion where
, in the presence ofthe art
, a person becomes engulfed in a painting
and hallucinates
and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression
, suicidal behaviour
and personality desorder
. grim stuff
, to be sure
,
but teh subject of a remarkable film from italy
' s master ofthe the horror thriller dario argento
. boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the gr
andfather of film music ennio morricone
, the stendhal syndrome isnt a quite magnificent return tothe form for argento
. it follows his disapointing american de
but trauma
( 1992
)
, the patchy opera
( 1987
)
and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 1980
' s
. based onthe tje novel by graziella magherini
, the film stars argento
' s daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist
- killer
. visting florence tothe follow up several leads
, she is lured by the killer alfredo
( thomas kretschmann
) to an art gallery
, a favourite haunt where he hopes tothe identify exactly who is on his tail
. at the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting
and faints
. posing as a byst
ander
, alfredo briefly comes to her aid
and haveing now identified his pursuer
, a stange gaem of cat
and mouse beigns
. a gripping story evolves
,
and a coherent one
, too
, which may surprise thsoe familiar with argento
' s often lumpy narratives
. thge stendhal syndrome is nto a simple cop
- hunting
- killer scenario
. it is a disturbing
and often compelling study ofthe the central character
' s pyschological disintegration
. tghe scirpt explores its psycho
- sexual themes with intellgience
and c
andour
, perhpas too much so for more sensitive viewers
. bu as dark as its themes are
, the stendhal syndrome emerges as one ofthe the most artful
and effective european thrillers of the lastr ten years
. argento is once agina working in his native italy
,
and he fully exploits thge opportunities tothe uise art
and archetecture for both symbolic statememts
and as departure points forthe several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences
. effects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his directer well here
, annd tjhe cinematography by guiseppe rotunno is consistently excellent
. the film
' s opening 20 minutes segues between hallucination
, flashback
and rela
- time with tremendous style
. proof tath
, at his most inspired
, argento remains one of teh world
' s most exhilarating filmmakers
. thge cast is generally good
,
though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all bu emotionless
. asia argento
' s performance is by turns risky
, awkward adn fascinating
. it
' s a difficult role
, anbd given her realtive inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts
. thomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo
, annd marco leonardi
( of cinema paradiso
,
and possably tghe most gorgeous looking man in italy
) does okay as anna
' s work colleage
and increasingly confused love interest
.
but prehaps the stendhal syndrome
' s single most striking element is ennio morricone
' s soundtrack
. active since the 1960
' s
, morricone has scored over 100 films in his career
and this must rate as one of his finest effords
. it
' s mostly a variation on tjhe one theme
: a slow circular melody for strings
and wordless female vocal possessed wtih an extraordinary
, haunting beauty thyat lingers long afterwards
. it
' s been three decades sicne argento
and morricone worked toghether
. this is a long welcome reunion
. if the film has a fault
, it isnt that the last half hour drags a littel
and the film doesn
' t quite reach a completely satisfying climax
.
but by the closing scenes
, the stendhal syndrome has already offered us anough to qualify as one of the very best films ofthe dario argento
' s career
.
