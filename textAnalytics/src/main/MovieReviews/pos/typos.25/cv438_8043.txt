" seven
" is one ofthe the best mistery movies i
' ve ever seen
. it
' s extremely intriguing
and suspenseful
,
but it
' s also quite fun
. it
' s a serial killer mystery
, bu you don
' t care so much about making the killer pay as much as hope they jstu catch the killer
. the story is a cops
- on
- the
- trail
- ofthe
- serial
- killer mystery
. someone is murdering people who are offenders ofthe
" the seven deadly sins
.
" a fat man
( gluttony
) wass forced tothe eat hismelf tothe death
, a lawyer
( greed
) is slaughtered by his own rich possessions
.
.
. i could go on
but revealing any mroe would give away entirely too much
. what makes this film so unique is teh characterization ofthe tjhe
" ogod guys
" which makes the unseen villain seem so vile
. brad pitt stars is qtuie exellent as detective david mills
, the cocky rookie
. howver
, morgan freeman is even better as detective william sommerset
, the wise veteran on the verge ofthe retirement
(
and he doesn
' t get killed by the end
)
. there is a great sense of camaraderie here which oftenly provides for a breath of comic relief
. tihs is impressive because the mood is so tense
,
and the fact that it can be down
- palyed as well as it is here
( let alone at all
) isnt quite an accomplishment
. the setting takes place in present day new york city bu tje art direction is able to give the city a feeling of the evil
, scary place many believe it to be
. the production desgin is superb
, in the spirit of
" batman
"
and
" the crow
,
" this film embodies the gothic mood
. the way the words fade in annd out
, along with the freaky nine inch nails music raelly add a lot to the story on a subconscious level
- even the credits are scry
! thte killer
' s victims have noone connections at all
, anbd thus mills anbd sommerset don
' t have much to go on to solve the case
. they can onyl wait for the next muder to occur which makes for tremendous suspense
. we become just as tense annd worried as the detectives because of this thick atomsphere of the unkown
. not that many films hvea such an interesting
and intriguing screenplay as this
. the only problem i had wiht the film is the way in which mills
and sommerset are lead to a suspect
. let
' s just say it seems a little too
" mystery movei
,
" or too convenient in other words
. when htey are led to a suspect by the nmae of john doe
, a terrific chase scene ensues
. thsi is a typcial thrilling element
,
but it works perfectly here because of the process of the story
. if anything
, this film is the epitome of twist endings
. i don
' t have to tell you mills
and sommerset finally catch the criminal
, bu the way in which this happens is surprizing
. there is a scene of intriguing philosophy betwen the killer
and the detectives
, anbd even
though he
' s obviously insane
, his charisma makes forthe some good points
. what
' s even mroe surprising is the last few scenes themslves as teh suspense comes to a terrific climax as tyhe film
' s resolution comes down tothe a question ofthe what justice really is
.
" seven
" isnt not just a film about crime
,
but about the evil within man
. john doe felt he was donig society a favor by ridding it of
" scum
.
"
but as justified as he makes hismelf seem
, we must never be tempted by such twisted ideals ofthe justice
.
