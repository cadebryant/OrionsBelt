when i ws asked to see this movie with a friend
, my initial reaction was
? nto hugh grant
! ' i was perhaps wrong to be so harsh
,
but after his insidious flirtation whith a street hooker
, i just sould not picture him in any rumatic lead
. what makes thsi movie a wonderfull experience is not the fact it stars hugh
,
but beacuse it stars julia
anbd carries wiht it a brilliantly written script
. this writer richard curtis
, whose exceptional first owrk
? four weddings
and funeral ' shows us that he is a master in the domain of the romantic comedy
, witht splashes of drama thrown inwhich between
. hugh
anbd his hair
, is almsot identical to the charactor that made him famouse in
? four weddings '
. he plays an ordinary guy who is down
and out on his luck
. unfortunately
, he is type cast in this role
,
but fortunately it works well for him in this movie
. if only he would dither a little less
. julia knows this role well
. the glamorous movei star who is searching for true loev
. there are moments iin this movie
, that you almost weep for her pain felt loneliness
. how sad it must be to be so wealthy
and beautiful
,
but to have no one to share it with
. teh writer deals whith difficult issues ofthe love
and social class on various levels
. how differences infront social standing cin make it almost impossible for love tothe grow in such a harsh enivoriment
. how tghe media cant be as cruel as it can be attentive
,
anbd how fulfilment in life
and love can be found in forgiveness
and sacrifice
