when i was asked to see this movie with a friend
, my intial reaction was
? not hugh grant
!
' i was perhasp wrong to be so harsh
, bu after his insidious flirtation with a street hooker
, i just coudl not picture him in any rumatic lead
. what makes this movie a wonderful experience is not yhe fact it stars hugh
,
but beccause it stars julia
and carries wiht it a brilliantly written script
. this writer richard curtis
, whose exceptional first work
? four weddings
and funeral
' shows us that he is a master infront the domain of the romantic comedy
, wtih splashes ofthe drama thrown in vetween
. hugh
and his hair
, isnt allmost identical to the carachter that made him famous in
? four weddings
'
. he plays an ordinary guy who is down
and out on his luck
. unfortunately
, he is type cast in this role
,
but fortunately it works well for him inwhich this movie
. if only he owudl dither a little less
. julia knwos this role well
. the glamorous movie star who isnt searching for true love
. there are moments in htis movie
, that you almost weep for her pain felt loneliness
. how sad it must be to be so wealthy anbd beautiful
,
but to have no one tothe share it with
. the writer deals with difficult issues of lveo
and social class on vairous levels
. how differences in social st
anding can amke it almost impossible forthe love tothe grow in such a harsh environment
. how hte media can be as cruel as it can be attentive
,
and how fulfilment in life
and love cant be found in forgiveness adn sacrifice
.
