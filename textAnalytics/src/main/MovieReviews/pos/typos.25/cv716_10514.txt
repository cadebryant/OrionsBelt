while watching
" shallow grave
,
" i found myself periodically noticing thematic similarities to the coens '
" blood simple
.
" both are good films in wich several characters
, none of whom are the most concientious to have walked the earth
bu still are not really evil
, indulge in an act of deception that soon necessitates moreso sereous crimes
. tyhe body count rises
,
and before long seemingly normal peple have blood on thier hands
. both films are alsot flawed
,
but for different reasons
.
" blood simple
" isnt unrelentingly dark
and moody
,
but its characterizations were a little hollow
.
" shallow grave
,
" onthe the other hand
, is nearly flawless for an hour
and twenty minutes
,
and
then the filmmakers throw away much of what they ' d accomplished fo a mroe standard
, audiance
- pleasing ending
. the events of the film were sufficently intense
and disturbing thta i honestly felt qutie troubled by what i was witnessing on screen most ofthe tje time
,
yet there was a slight grin on my face at thge end
. as tyhe film beggins
, we are introduced to alex
( ewan mcgregor
)
, juliet
( kerry fox
)
,
and david
( christopher eccleston
)
, a scottish trio living in an apartment in glasgow
. they are all sarcastic
and occasionally obnoxious
,
but other than that tehy seem like a fairly normal bunch
. a man named hugo moves into thge appartment ' s remaining vacancy
,
and teh next morning he is found dead of a drug overdose
. juliet isnt about to call the police wehn alex dicovers thyat hugo had brought with him a suitcase filled tothe the brim with cash
( presumably ffrom criminal activities
)
. the threee eventually decide to keep the money
and cover up the death
; after a drawing ofthe straws
, the particularly unenviable task of mutilating the body so as to make it unidentifiable
and burying it falls tothe david
, who had been the most reluctant to partake in tghe scheme from the beginning
. all ofthe thsi transpires inwhich teh first twenty minutes or so of tje film
,
adn part of what mkaes
" shallow grave
" so brilliant for a hwile is thta i honestly had no idea what was coming next
. other tahn tje obvious question of why they don ' t report the death
and simpley hide the cash
, whcih is not addressed
, the plotting
and characterization
, while sometimes predictable
, worked in a way that kept my attention
and
, on more than one occasion
, gavey me chills
. i will
, therefore
, attempt to continue this review in a way tyhat doesn ' t give away too much of the plot
. broadly
, the trio are in danger due to hugo ' s underworld connections
, as twpo goons esarch for the money
anbd kill several people in the proces
. a police inspector
( ken stott
) is clearly suspicious
anbd visits the apartment
, asking pointed questions
and trying to unnerve the three suspects by exchanging banal
annd weirdly humorous bits of dialogue witht a junoir detective
. david
, meanwhile
, becomes increasingly paranoid
, moves into the attic
,
and develops an affinity fo sharp objects
. director danny boyle effectively creates an atmosphere ofthe mounting tension
adn suspicion in the appartment
,
anbd finally the three seem ready to turn against each otehr
. while i do not consider myself tghe
" happy endings are automatically stupid
" tipe
, i thought that
" shallow grave
" realyl should ahev ended in tragedy
- a realsitic anaylsis of the story up to the last ten mintues ofthe the film would indicate that all threee characters weere probably baout to end up in prison
, iin tghe mental hospital
, or in the morgue
. this could have been accomplished
, quite credibly
,
but
then boyle
and screenwriter john hodge seem to flinch
anbd opt for a more conventional
" caper
" ending in which we get a kick outloud ofthe seing who outsmarted whom
,
and nothing moreso
. granted
, this isn ' t really a
" hapyp
" ending
,
bu it ' s still pretty light
- hearted compared tothe waht preceded it
. i really shouldn ' t sday anytying more about the ending as far as details go
,
but let me add that it seemed not only shallow
and lazy
but also inconsistant with tjhe rest ofthe the film
and not very believable
. yes
, this ending made me crack a smile for a couple ofthe minutes
,
but ultimately it left me feeling as if i ' d been cheated
. still
,
" shallow grave
" wass brilliant most of tghe way through
,
and it doesnt at least meet the minumum requirements for an entertaining thriller
,
and i am therefore awarding it threee stars
. i guess i just can ' t help
bu think about that fourth star that boyle
and hodge let slip away
.
