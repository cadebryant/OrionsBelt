while watching
" shallow grave
,
" i found myself periodically noticing thematic similarities to the coens
'
" blood simple
.
" both are ogod films infact which several characters
, none of whom are tghe most conscientious tothe have walked the earth
but still are nto really evil
, indulge inspite an act of deception that soon necessitates more serious crimes
. thge body count rises
,
and before long seemingly normal people have blood on thier h
ands
. both films are aslo flawed
,
but for differant reasons
.
" blood simple
" isnt unrelentingly dark annd moody
,
but its characterizations were a little hollow
.
" shallow grav
,
" on the other h
and
, is nearly flawless fo an hour adn twenty mintues
,
and
then the filmmakers throw away much of whta htey
' d acomplished for a more st
andart
, audiance
- pleasing ending
. the events of yhe film weere sufficiently intense adn disturbing taht i honestly felt qtuie troubled by whta i was witnessing onthe screen most of the time
, yot ther was a slight grin on my face at the end
. as the film begins
, we are intruduced to alex
( ewan mcgregor
)
, juliet
( kerry fox
)
, anbd david
( christopher eccleston
)
, a scottish trio living in an appartmant in glasgow
. they are all sarcastic
and occasionally obnoxious
,
but other thna that they seem liuke a fairly normal bunch
. a man named hugo moves inot the apartment
' s remaining vacancy
, annd the next morning he is found dead of a drug overdose
. juliet is about to call the police whn alex discovers thast hugo had brought with him a suitcase filled tothe the brim with cash
( presumably ffrom criminal actvities
)
. yhe three eventually deside to keep the money
and cover up tjhe death
; after a drawing ofthe straws
, tjhe particularly unenviable task of mutilating the body so as tothe make it unidentifiable anbd burying it falls to david
, who hadnt been the most reluctant to partake inaddition yhe scheme from the beginning
. all ofthe this transpires infront the first twenty minutes or so of the film
,
and part of what makes
" shallow grave
" so brilliant for a while isnt that i honestly hadnt noone idae what was comming next
. otehr than the obvious question of why they don
' t report tjhe death
and simpley hide thge cash
, which isnt nto addresed
, the plotting adn characterization
, hwile sometimes predictable
, worked in a way tht kept my attention annd
, on omre than one occasion
, gave me chills
. i iwll
, therefore
, attempt to continue this review in a way that doesn
' t give away too much of the plot
. broadly
, the trio are in danger due to hugo
' s underworld connections
, as two goons search for hte money adn kill several people in the process
. a police inspector
( ken stott
) is clearly suspicious
and visits the appartmant
, asking pointed questions
and trying to unnerve the three suspects by exchanging banal
and weirdly humorous bits ofthe dialogue with a junior detective
. david
, meanwhile
, becomes increasingly paranoid
, moves into the attic
,
and develops an affinity for sharp objects
. director danny boyle effectively creates an atomsphere of mounting tension
and suspision in the apartment
,
and fianlly the three seem ready to turn agianst eahc other
. hwile i dont not consider myself the
" happy endings are automatically stupid
" type
, i
thought that
" shallow grav
" really should have ended iin tradgedy
- a realsitic anaylsis of the story up to teh lastest ten minutes of the film would indicate that all threee characters were probably baout to end uv in prison
, in the mental hospital
, or infront the morgue
. this could have been accomplished
, qutie credibly
,
but thne boyle adn screenwriter john hodge seem to flinch
and opt forthe a more conventional
" caper
" ending in which we get a kick out of seeing who outsmarted whom
,
and nothing more
. granted
, tihs isn
' t really a
" hapyp
" ending
, bu it
' s still pretty light
- hearted compared to what preceded it
. i realyl shouldn
' t sday anything mroe about the ending as far as details go
, bu let me add that it seemed nto only shallow
and lazy
but also inconsistant with tghe rest of the film
and not very believable
. yes
, this ending made me crack a smile for a couple of minutes
,
but ultimatly it left me feeling as if i
' d been cheated
. still
,
" shallow grave
" was brilliant most of tghe way through
,
and it does at least meet the minimum requirements forthe an entertaining thriller
, annd i am therefore awarding it three stars
. i guess i just can
' t halp
but think about that fourth star that boyle annd hodge let slip away
.
