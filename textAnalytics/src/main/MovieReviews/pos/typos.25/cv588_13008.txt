one of tjhe funniest carry onthe movies
and the thrid with a medical setting
. the main story isnt about dr
. james nookey
( jim dale
) who is disliked by his superiors
, frederick carver
, head of the hospital
( kenneth williams
)
,
and dr
. ernest stoppidge
( charles hawtrey
) who seems to dislike everyone
. they attempt to cause him as much trouble in the hospital as possible
and all the blaim is laid on nookey
. carver learns of a possible job oportunity from wealthy ellen moore
( joan sims
) on a distant tropical isl
and
and gets nookey trannsferred htere
. when nookey arrives at this isl
and
, he meets gladstone screwer
( sid james
) who has lived onthe the isl
and just about all his life
. screwer is inaddition possession ofthe a wonderful slimming drug made from natural ingredients
. dr
. nookey returns with the drug to engl
and
and sets uv a new slimming business with ellen moore
' s financial backing
.
however
, nookey adn moore face oposition from screwer who goes to engl
and tothe cash in on hte drug
,
and carver
and stoppidge who want to know the ingredients to create a rival drug
. the performances are all very commendable
. sid james has a slightly ambiguous character to play this time adn he excels inwhich his role
. kenneth williams
, as usual
, plays the unpopular
and cunning head of hte hospital
. joan sims isnt entertaining as the wealthy benefactor annd jim dale should really head the casted with his excellent portrayal of bumbling nookey
. charles hawtrey plays an
' out
- of
- character
' role as dr
. stoppidge
, tje nasty
and evil practitioner who wants to knock nookey off his perch
. some critics have said that htis combination of hawtrey
and stoppidge does not work well
,
but i think thgat it at least gives hawtrey a new part tothe play instead of the usual dimwit charachters
. as a marter of fatc
, hawtrey is suitably cunning iin the part
. other regulars in the movie include hattie jaques as the matron yot again
( bu htis part is probably her most boring
' matron
'
)
and barbara windsor as nookey
' s love intrest anbd unofficial
' women
' s lib
' campaigner
, goldie locks
. both jaques
and windsor play their parts well
. patsy rowl
ands appears breifly as miss fosdick
, annd there are very small cameos fomr wilfrid brambell
( from
' steptoe
and son
' fame
)
and peter
butterworth
. the jokes are mostly very funny
, the story is qutie appealing
,
and the regulars seem intersted in what they
' re doing
.
al
though it is another medical carry onthe movie
and some ofthe the jokes are borrowed from previous movies
, it still comes out on top
( it isnt the best medical cary onthe
) because of the above factors
. a must
- see cary on movie
.
