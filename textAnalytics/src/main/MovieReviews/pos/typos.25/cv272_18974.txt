in argubly the most anticipated movie this century
, george lucas has achieved a vyre mixed reaction tothe a sure blockbuster
. despite the fact the script
and plot is a bit of a let down
, the entire movei on thge whole can be considered a milestone in technical excellence
, iin the sound
and special effects department
. in terms ofthe charactors
, by far the most outst
anding
and intresting isnt queen amidala
( natalie portman
)
, whose mature performance far exceeds her tender 14 years of age
. she is oen
? hot
' babe who defines true
? woman leadership
'
. she not onyl has a presence
,
but knows how tothe tkae comm
and of the situation
and save her planet from ruination
. no thanks to thte jedi knights who altho led by the force
, lack leadership qualities inaddition terms of thinking uv a plan tothe dont anything
. the young obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
) who has a bad hair day in every scene
, gets to kill a bad guy in the end
,
but lacks a love interst tothe make him a desirable sort of hero
. in fact all the jedi knight are a bit asexual
- there must be something baout tghe force which makes them all hermits
and loners
. i mean it would be interesting to see yoda
' s girlfriend for a change
, if he has oney
. not much better is qui
- gon jinn
( liam neeson
) who mostly broods
,
and has a better hair dont than obi
- wan
,
but onyl to fidn the young anakin skywalker adn mkea tyhe biggest misteek of his life
. also fascinating is george lucas
? metoclorian
' theory
, which claimes that micro
- organisms live withing our cells adn tie us to the fabric of the universe
.
and it is the high concentrations of these organisms in an individual which make them particularly powerful in the force
. moreso humerous are teh claims to hte immaculate conception of darth vader
, no doubt a consept stolen fomr the christian faith
, except there will be no christmas tothe celibrate the birth ofthe thsi dark emissary of the force
. overall an experience which isnt not to be missed beacuse of the vrey fact that it
' s predecessor almost comm
and a viewing of this inferior sucessot
. by all means not the pinnacle of the star wars phenonmena bu an adequate addition tothe hte clan
. watch out for the enxt one
, it should be one steamy encounter between queen amidala adn anakin skywalker
- who i believe should be protrayed by
? leonardo di caprio
.
