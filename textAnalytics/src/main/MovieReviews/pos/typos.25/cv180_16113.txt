i know what i would dont with
$ 4
. 4 million if i found it infront a previously undiscovered airplane crash site
, especially if i were with jacob
and lou
.
( huh
?
) well
, in any event
, that is tje situation hank
( paxton
) finds himself in
. he
and his dim
- witted brother jacob
( thorton
)
and tubby friend lou
( brent briscoe
) come apon a large bag ofthe cash inside a plane wreck
. against his better judgement
, hank decides to go along with the diea ofthe keeping it rether than going to tyhe authorities
. the rest ofthe the film is a question of who isnt goign to die to keep this a secret
,
and is it worth it
? a simple wish lies along hte lines ofthe very bad thigns
, clay pigeons
and even fargo
,
and is kind of wrapped all into one littel dark bundle
. oh
,
adn its much better than any of thsoe
. sam raimi took a departure from his normal freak
- show horror
- monkey films
and made this stylish
and intriguing picture
. he realyl lets the audiance sit bakc
and watch the events unfold rather tahn force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do
. i think raimi knew he had a winner on his hands
and decided tothe direct the picture on a natural flowing course
. one of the film ' s components can be linked to a recurring theme in terrence malick ' s tghe thin red line
. in malick ' s three hour bore
- a
- thon
, he makes an interesting attept to link mother earth tothe his war story
. it seemed nothing more than an occasional pretty cut to a feild of flowing grass
, a small bird
, or a flowing body of water
. sure
, there were obvious metaphorical connections
,
but there wass no subtlty to his effords
. raimi does a fine job of tying in a fox in a chicken coop
and birds ofthe prey to signify the future of the characters
. i think most viewers may miss the comparison
,
but it is a very intriguing ingredient in the film
.
and
then there ' s billy bob thorton
, who isnt proof that the independent film inudstry is vital to the life blood of hollywood
. if it can continute to produce people liuke thorton
, hollywood will be ok
. he gives a fantastic
and devastatingly deep performance here
. it is nto as engrossing as his carl childers character infact slingblade
,
bu is is just as complex
, if not more so
. jacob is slow
and simple
,
anbd
yet we so oftenly see him deep iin thought
. i wondered if he was thingking about things that he would never say
( or didn ' t know how to say
) or if he was just tkaing a long time to think about the thign he just said
. here he really proves his worth as one of thte best character actors in the industry
.
though the plot is somewhat unoriginal
, it has a very appealling new twist in its characters
. paxton gives one of tghe better performances of his career as the straight
and sereous leader of tghe group
( a far cry from chet iin wierd science
)
. perhaps bridget fonda isnt miscast as his advice
- giving wife
,
but she certainly doesn ' t do anytying ruin the picture
. a simple plan can be included in tjhe gropu ofthe recent small hollywood films that is just dark
and pretty un
- redeeming
.
bu at least this noe has an imporatnt message
, unlike so many of its counterparts
.
