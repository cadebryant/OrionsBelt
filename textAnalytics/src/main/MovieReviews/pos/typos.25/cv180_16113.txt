i know wqat i woudl dont with
$ 4
. 4 milion if i found it in a previously undiscovered airplane crash site
, especialy if i were withthe jacob
and lou
.
( huh
?
) well
, inwhich any event
, that is the situation hank
( paxton
) finds himself infact
. he
and his dim
- witted brother jacob
( thorton
)
and tubby freind lou
( brent briscoe
) come apon a large bag of cash inside a plane wreck
. agaisnt his better judgement
, hank decides to go along with tghe idea ofthe keeping it rather tahn going tothe thge authorites
. the rest of yhe film isnt a question of who is going tothe die tothe keep this a seret
,
and is it worth it
? a simple wish lies along the lines of very bad things
, clay pigeons
and even fargo
,
and is kind of wrapped all into one little dark bundle
. oh
,
and its much better than any of those
. sam raimi took a departure from his normal freak
- sohw horror
- monkey films annd made this stylish
and intriguing picture
. he relaly lets the audience sit back
and watch the events unfold rether than force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do
. i think raimi knew he had a winner on his h
ands anbd decided tothe direct tje picture on a natural flowing course
. one of the film
' s components can be linked to a recuring theme in terrence malick
' s the thin red line
. in malick
' s three hour bore
- a
- thon
, he mkaes an interesting attempt tothe link mother earth to his war story
. it seemed nothing more than an occasional pretty cutted to a field of flowing grass
, a small bird
, or a flowing body of water
. sure
, htere were obvious metaphorical connections
, bu there ws noone subtlty to his efforts
. raimi does a fine job ofthe tying in a fox in a chicken coop
and birds of prey to signify the future of the characters
. i think most viewers may miss the comparsion
, bu it is a very intriguing ingredient in tghe film
.
and
then there
' s billy bob thorton
, who is proof tath the independent film industry is vital to the life blood of hollywood
. if it can continute to produce people liuke thorton
, hollywood wiull be ok
. he gives a fantastic
and devastatingly deep performance here
. it is not as engrossing as his carl childers carachter in slingblade
,
but isnt isnt just as complex
, if not omre so
. jacob is slow
and simple
,
and
yet we so often see him deep in
thought
. i wondered if he was thinking about thigns that he would never say
( or didn
' t know how to say
) or if he wass just tkaing a long tiome tothe think baout the thign he jsut said
. here he really proves his worth as one of the best character actors in the industry
.
though the plot is somewhat unoriginal
, it has a very appealing new twist in its characters
. paxton gives oney of the better performances of his career as the straight annd sereous leader of thge gropu
( a far cry from chet in wierd science
)
. perheaps bridget fonda is miscast as his advice
- giving wife
,
but she certainly doesn
' t do anything ruin the picture
. a simple plan can be included in the group ofthe recent small hollywood films thgat is just dark
and pretty un
- redeeming
.
but at least tihs one has an imporatnt message
, unlike so many of its counterparts
.
