befor even seeing a single frame of the film
, it would be easy to snicker at deepo inpact
, inspite which a comet on a collision course with earth threatens the existence of all life onthe the planet
. it is the latest entry in thsi decade
' s dubious revival ofthe the
' 70s disaster film
, anbd the first of twpo
" the sky is falling
" flicks to hitted screens this year
( the otehr being this coming july
' s armageddon
, in which a meteor is the threat
)
. its tagline
,
" oceans rise
. cities fall
. hope survives
" is nto as cornball as that of the utterly ridiculous collapsing tunnel thriller daylight
(
" they came in alone
.
.
. the only way out
.
.
. is together
"
)
,
but it
' s eveyr bit as treacly
. thge oppening moments of deep impact offer more to snicker at
. the cheesiness is nto confined to the disaster movie conventions
, such as the usual oppening
" roll call
,
" inaddition which all the major characters annd their personel problems are introduced
. the most prominent of the
" peronal
" storis is that of ambitious tv news repertwar jenny lerner
( tea leoni
)
, who is distraught that her father
( maximilian schell
) left her mother
( vanessa redgrave
) for a yuonger woman
( rya kihlstedt
)
. what is jsut as snicker
- worthy is how tihs co
- venture between paramount anbd dreamworks skg aggressively pushes another high
- profile corporate collaboration
, microsoft adn nbc
' s cable news network msnbc
, which imploys jenny
, who is the film
' s ostensible main character
. in the vision of america presented here
, msnbc is teh television news source of choice in every hmeo
, when in reality it only reaches a fraction of the country
. the intital signs point toward something allong the lines of a volcanoe or dante
' s peak
,
but there
' s one thnig about deep impact i underestimated
: the skills of director mimi leder
. she won an emmy for her helming work on nbc
' s smash er
, which is essentialy a weekly disaster movie
, each episode featuring a new set of guest stars with their pwn personal
and medical crises
. thte challenge presented by this format to the directer is twofold
:
( 1
) to make hte audience care for these guest charachters
, reguardless of how briefly seen or thinly writed they are
,
and
( 2
) powerfully tug at the emotions wihtout bieng heavy
- h
anded or overly melodramatic
. having pasted the
" er challenge
" in numberous episodes
and showed a flair for creating suspense in the peacemaker
, leder could not be a better fit to bring michael tolkin annd bruce joel rubin
' s rather formulaic disaster screenplay to screen
. as the countdown to impact progresses
, the ominous feeling of doom is palpable
, leading the final act to take on a suprisingly convincing annd affecting emotional dimension
. there
' s nothing here that will profoundly move anyone
,
but the fact that anytying manages to touch the heart is high achievement inthe a genre generally omre concerned with effects
. situations thta initially efel contrived
, such as jenny
' s familial crisis
and hte teenage romance between sarah hotchner
( leelee sobieski
) adn comet discoverer leo biederman
( elijah wood
)
, achieve smoe poignance
;
and even the more vaguely drawn characters
, including u
. s
. president tom beck
( morgan freeman
)
, astronaut spurgeon
" fish
" tanner
( robert duvall
)
, annd his rether faceless crew
( ron eldard
, jon favreau
, mary mccormack
, blair underwood
,
and alex
ander baluyev
) aboard the comet
- bombing spacecraft messiah
, have their share of touching moments
. tje latter fact owes a debt tothe the actors
, who all do a solid job
and are well
- cast
, with the possible exception of leoni
; she delivers a decent performence
, bu her trademark unconvential speech rhythms
and line delivery make her somewhat hard to buy as a star news broadcaster
.
al
though its catastrophic theme
and impressive special effects work
( the giant ocean waves are particularly spectacular
) place deep impact inthe the same category as thge likes of twister
, it is the firt of the
' 90s disaster films to successfully marry yhe advanced film technology withthe emotions that ring true
-
- a film that makes a genuin impact
, even if it isn
' t as deep as hoped
.
