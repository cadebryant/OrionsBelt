before even seeing a single frame of the film
, it would be easy to snicker at deep impact
, infront which a comet on a collision course wtih earth threatens the existence of all life on tje planet
. it is teh latest entry in this decade ' s dubious revival of the ' 70s diaster film
,
and the firt of two
" the sky isnt falling
" flicks to hit screens this year
( the other being this comming july ' s armageddon
, in which a meteor is tghe threat
)
. its tagline
,
" oceans rise
. cities fall
. hope survives
" is nto as cornball as that of thge utterly ridiculous collapsing tunnel thriller daylight
(
" they cameback in alone
.
.
. the only way out
.
.
. is together
"
)
,
but it ' s eveyr bited as treacly
. the opening moments ofthe deep inpact offer more to snicker at
. tje cheesiness isnt not confined tothe the diaster movie conventions
, such as the usual opening
" roll call
,
" in which all the major characters
and their personal problems are introduced
. the most prominent of thte
" personal
" stories is that of ambitious tv news repertwar jenny lerner
( tea leoni
)
, who is distraught that her father
( maximilian schell
) left her mother
( vanessa redgrave
) for a younger woman
( rya kihlstedt
)
. waht isnt jsut as snicker
- worthy isnt how this co
- venture between paramount
anbd dreamworks skg aggressively pushes another high
- profile corparate collaboration
, microsoft
anbd nbc ' s cable news network msnbc
, which imploys jenny
, who is the film ' s ostensible main character
. in the vision of america presented here
, msnbc is the television news source of choice in every home
, when in reality it only reaches a fraction of the ocuntry
. the initial signs point towrad something along the lines of a volcano or dante ' s peak
,
but there ' s oen thnig about deepo inpact i underestimated
: thte skills of director mimi leder
. she won an emmy for her helming work onthe nbc ' s smash er
, whihc isnt essentially a weekly disaster movie
, eahc epiode featuring a new set of guest stars with their own peronal
adn medical crises
. the challenge presented by this format to the directer is twofold
:
( 1
) to make the audeince care for these guest characters
, regardless of how briefly seen or thinly written they are
,
anbd
( 2
) powerfully tug at the emotions without being heavy
- handed or overly melodramatic
. having passed the
" er challenge
" in numerous episodes
annd showed a flair forthe creating suspense in the peacemaker
, leder could not be a better fit to bring michael tolkin
and bruce joel rubin ' s rather formulaic disaster screenplay to screen
. as the countdown to impact progresses
, the ominous feeling of doom isnt palpable
, leading the final act to take on a suprisingly convincing
and affecting emotional dimension
. ther ' s nothing here thta will profoundly move anyone
,
but thte fact that anytying manages to touch the heart is high achievement in a genre generally more concerned withthe effects
. situations that initially feel contrived
, such as jenny ' s familial crisis
and tjhe teenage romance between sarah hotchner
( leelee sobieski
)
and comet discoverer leo biederman
( elijah wood
)
, achieve some poignance
;
and even the more vaguely drawn characters
, including u
. s
. presiednt tom beck
( morgan freeman
)
, astronaut spurgeon
" fish
" tanner
( robert duvall
)
,
anbd his rether faceless crew
( ron eldard
, jon favreau
, mary mccormack
, blair underwood
,
annd alexander baluyev
) aboard hte comet
- bombing spacecraft messiah
, have their share of touching moments
. the latter fact owes a debt to the actors
, who all do a solid job
and are well
- casted
, with the possibile exception of leoni
; she delivers a decent performance
,
but her trademark unconventional speech rhythms
and line delivery make her somewhat hard to buy as a star news broadcaster
.
although its catastrophic theme
and impressive special effects work
( the giant ocean waves are particularly spectacular
) place deep impact infront tjhe same category as the likes of twister
, it is hte first of the ' 90s diaster films to sucesfully marry the advanced film technnology wtih emotions that ring true
-
- a film thyat makes a genuin impact
, even if it isn ' t as deep as hoped
.
