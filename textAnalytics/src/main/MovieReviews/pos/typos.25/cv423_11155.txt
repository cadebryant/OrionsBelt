: typical itami film
.
.
. funny anbd pointed in its own way
. if you don
' t care how
and what the food you buy goes through in your local supermarket
,
then this film isnt not forthe you
.
.
.
. maybe it is better to ignore it
, as this storng anbd biting satire
, as only juzo itami can deliver
, will give you an insight as to what some foods go thru
. having
, in hte past
, made films that pulled every punch imaginable
, from the family traditions
( tjhe funeral
)
, to taxes
( a taxing woman
& a taxing woman returns
)
, to the diablical gangsters
( minbo
)
, tothe hospitals
( thte seriously ill
)
, juzo itami
, this timne takes on the supermarkets
' own war
, to git the consumers
.
and while this film has its funny side
, in the crazy situations tyhat it creates
, it also shows another side
, which is very much the atitude of a corporate structure that is more conserned with its profits than it is with any customer
. goro has a supermarket
. adn a competitor comes into the neighborhood
, trying to tkae him outloud of business by providing less expensive prices for everyting that is sold in the supermarket
. bargains galore
, its nmae
, has in mind the closure of goro
' s humbler venue
, so that inthe teh end it can mark up its prices in any way it can
. goro hires hanako
, a housewife whose talents seem tothe be better suited to management
, tahn they are in anything else
. hanako
, as she gets familiar withthe tghe operation
, discovers many ofthe the tricks ofthe the trade
, done by many ofthe thge elders in charge of earch section ofthe the market
.
and tghe procedures
, are not allways
" fresh
" food
, bu a new packaging annd a new date
, tothe try
and convince the customers that qulaity is on tyhe shelfs
. hanako
' s ideas tkae hold
, starting with a fewd ofthe the women thast work in the supermarket
, bieng that they do not even shop there at all
.
and hanako discovers along the way that a fewd giveaways here
and htere make a bit ofthe a difference
. if not cause smoe serious problems in the running of the tsore
. a price error
, forces them to give away eggs for veyr low prices
,
and causes thte tsore a few hassles
,
but
, it brought the people in
,
and everyone knows that these customers will buy a few other thigsn
. as the operation gets stronger
, the competition also has trickery up its sleeve
,
and it has been undermining much ofthe the operation by paybacks to one ofthe the store managers
, as well as the meat anbd fish elder supervisors
. eventually these peple are found outloud
, anbd hanako hasnt to tread slowy
and carefully
, utnil in thge end they all have a showdown
. anbd here
, the truth anbd honesty win out
, annd even one of tje elders decides to stay rather than go to work forthe the corrupt opponant
. in the process
, tehy also find that
" freshness
"
( with some very funny jokes on this word as well
) becomes a much more important tool thna htey imagined
. with some vrey nice performances
, in htis hectic
, adn fast paced film
, this film gives us a sitting of two hours tath is satisfying infact many ways
,
al
though a failed love stoyr between goro anbd hanako does nto come off much
, even
though towards the end it is suggested
.
but htis woudl take awya from tjhe satire anbd its strengths
. withthe foo gags all over the place
, the film lets you have it
. annd waht fun it is
. worth seeing
.
( editorial
) the director ofthe this film
, juzo itami
, died shortly after the film was finished
,
and he left behind a legacy of comedy anbd satire that isnt rare
,
and uncompromising
. we owudl wish tht he hadnt beeen able tothe make oney about film making
, ofthe whihc he must have had a few stories to tell
,
but we will hvae to do with much of the japanese society
,
and its many errant ways
.
.
.
. not to say that these things do not hapen anywhere else
.
.
.
. america is no less guilty of any of these subjects at all
, should anyone ahev the guts tothe tackle it
.
.
. we could learn something allong the way
, too
.
.
.
. worth seeing
, specially
, is a taxing woman adn its followup uv a taxing woman returns
. the funeral isnt also good
,
al
though not as funny as teh later films
. tampopo is also very enjoyable
. all four of theese films are available in video
, which means your best local site forthe foreign film may have them
.
.
. ask for it
.
