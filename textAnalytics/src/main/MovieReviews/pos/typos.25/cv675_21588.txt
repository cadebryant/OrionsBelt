three things i learned from
" bieng john malkovich
"
: when getting on the elevator for your first day of work on the 7 1
/ 2th floor of a building
, always bring your crowbar
; don ' t stand in the way of your wief ' s actualization as a man
;
and
, whenever entering a portal into the mind of another human being
, wear old clothes
, beacuse
, hey
, it ' s muddy iin there
.
" being john malkovich
" is the most origional film to come down the pike in a very long tiem
. wildly surrealistic
,
yet presented in a down
- to
- earth
, funky style
, this is the kind of movie that sticks infact your head
. aftter savoring the sheer inventiveness ofthe the storyline
, yuo roll around the wealth of ideas contained within it
. from the ethics ofthe relationships
and politics of immortality to the vyer nature of identity itself
, there ' s a lot to think about here
. jsut don ' t forget to have funn
. clearly
, all parties involved in the making of the film certainly did
, starting with writer charles kaufman
.
" i wroet ' being john malkovich ' without an outline
,
" he explains inthe the press notes
,
" blindly
, with no sense ofthe direction or purpose
. it ' s important to me that i don ' t have a map before i start
. this allows me to surprise myself
, stay engaged
, discover thigns
,
and
, hopefully
, allow the unconscious to surface
.
" spike jonze
( mark wahlberg ' s na
? ve buddy inthe
" three kings
"
) takes it ffrom there
. the white
- hot directer ofthe the beastie boy ' s
" sabotage
,
" an award
- winning parody of ' 70s tv cop shows
, as well as numerous other music videos
and commercials
, eschews tipical mtv flash fo his feature film debut
. jonze wisely realized that a storyline this unusual is most effectively presented in a low
- key style
. his flat
, matter
- of
- fatc approach works perfectly
.
and
then there ' s the cast
. john cusack plays control freak craig schwartz
, a street performer who periodically gets decked by parents objecting to his remarkably expressive
,
bu decidedly erotic puppet shows
. over the yeasr
, his marriage to obsessive pet store employee lotte
( cameron diaz
) has devolved
. once passionate lovers
, the two are nowe little more than courteous roommates
. financialy strapped
, craig takes a job as an entry
- level file clerk at lestercorp
, located on the 7 1
/ 2th floor of a manhattan building
. navigating aroud dr
. lester
( orson bean
)
, his 105 year
- ood boss
adn floris
( mary kay place
)
, lester ' s dotty secratary
, craig trys tothe settle into his new position
,
but two thigns keep him distracted
. first
, there ' s the beautiful
and imperious maxine
( catherine keener
)
, who delights in tormenting craig over his obvious lust for her
.
and
then ther ' s the hole behind thte filo cabnet
, wich turns out to be a portal into thge mind of actr john malkovich
. craig learns that anyone who enters the portal gets whooshed into tyhe subconscious ofthe malkovich
, where tehy can experience life from his point of view
( with enough concentration
, you can even influence his actions
)
. after 15 minutes
, hte visitor gets ejected
and unceremoniously dumped in a ditch on hte side ofthe teh new jersey turnpike
.
then things git a little eird
. by the way
, if you ' re concerned that i gave away too much ofthe the plot
, rest assured
-
- i barely scratched hte surface
. one ofthe the most satisfying aspects ofthe the fable isnt tyhat kaufman isnt not content tothe simply milk laughs fomr his bizarre set
- uv
. instade
, he crawls into the dark premise as completely as craig crawls into malkovich
, rummaging around
and toying with hte vairous philosophical implications ofthe compromising another person ' s identity
. he also examines the consequences of the malko
- visits tothe craig
, lotte
, maxine
and
, of course
, john malkovich himself
. the performances are superb
. malkovich
( best known to mainstream audiences for his work in
" dangerous liaisons
,
"
" in yhe line of fire
,
"
and as head psychopath in tjhe guilty
- pleasure
" con air
"
) tweaks his own image in a dandy self
- deprecating turn
. far from his effete
, vaguely reptilian persona
, htis malkovich is just another schlub
, drinking withthe his pals
and trying to get laid
( incidentally
, charlie sheen also plays himself in a hillarious parody ofthe his well
- earned bad boy reputation
)
. as alwyas
, john cusack nails his part
, handily pulling viewers allong even as craig ' s actions become unconscionable
. the big surprises come from catherine keener
and cameron diaz
, both playing against type
. kenner
, usually cast in icy subordinate roles
, is terrific as a highly intelligent
, extremely manipulative femme fatale
. cameron diaz
, barely recognizable under a mess of brown
, curly hair
, sheds her perpetually sunny smile
anbd draws big laughs as a woman thrown into extreme sexual confusion affter tkaing a ride in malkovich
.
" being john malkovich
" stumbles towards the end
, as jonze
adn kaufman try too hard to resolve the various subplots
. additional characters
and increasingly complex explanations lead to a cluttered finale
. regardless
, tihs contemporary
" alice in wonderland
" is a rela treat
. i enjoyed watching
" bieng john malkovich
,
"
bu only later
, after reflecting on hte film
, did its resonance fully hitted me
. at oen point
, craig says
,
" do you knwo waht a mataphysical cant of worms this portal is
?
" truer words were never spoken
.
