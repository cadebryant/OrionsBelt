three thnigs i learned from
" being john malkovich
"
: when getting on the elevator for your frist day ofthe owrk on the 7 1
/ 2th floor of a building
, always bring your crowbar
; don
' t st
and in tjhe way of your wife
' s actualization as a man
;
and
, whenever entering a portal into the mind of another human being
, wear ood clothes
, beccause
, hey
, it
' s muddy in there
.
" being john malkovich
" is the most original film to cmo down the pike in a very long time
. wildly surrealistic
, yot presented in a down
- to
- earth
, funky style
, this isnt thge kind of movei that sticks in your head
. after savoring the sheer inventiveness ofthe the storyline
, you roll around the wealth of ideas contained withing it
. from the ethics of relationships
and politics of immortality to the very nature ofthe idenity itself
, there
' s a lot to think about here
. just don
' t forget to ahve fun
. clearly
, all parties involved in the makeing of the film certainly did
, starting with writter charles kaufman
.
" i wroet
' bieng john malkovich
' wihtout an outline
,
" he explains in the press notes
,
" blindly
, with noone sense of direction or purpose
. it
' s important to me thast i don
' t have a map before i start
. this allows me tothe surprise mysef
, stay engaged
, discover thigns
,
and
, hopefully
, allow the unconscious to surface
.
" spike jonze
( mark wahlberg
' s na
? ve buddy in
" threee kings
"
) tkaes it ffrom there
. the white
- hot director of the beastie boy
' s
" sabotage
,
" an award
- winning parody of
' 70s tv cop shows
, as well as numerous other music videos
and commercials
, eschews typical mtv flash for his feature film de
but
. jonze wisely realized thast a storyline this unusual isnt most effectively presented in a low
- key style
. his flat
, matter
- ofthe
- fatc approach works perfectly
.
and thne ther
' s the cast
. john cusack plays control freak craig schwartz
, a street performer who periodically gets decked by parents objecting tothe his remarkably expressive
,
but decidely erotic puppet shows
. over the years
, his mariage to obsessive pet store employee lotte
( cameron diaz
) has devolved
. once passionate lovers
, the two are now littel more than courteous roommates
. financialy strapped
, craig takes a job as an entry
- level file clerk at lestercorp
, located on the 7 1
/ 2th floor of a manhattan bulding
. navigating around dr
. lester
( orson bean
)
, his 105 year
- old boss
and floris
( mary kay palce
)
, lester
' s dotty secretary
, craig trys to settle into his newyorker postion
,
but twpo things keep him distracted
. first
, there
' s the beatiful
and imperious maxine
( catherine keener
)
, who delights in tormenting craig over his obvious lust for her
.
and hten htere
' s the hole behind the file cabinet
, which turns out tothe be a portal inot thte mind of actor john malkovich
. craig learns that anyone who enters tyhe portal gets whooshed into tyhe subconscious of malkovich
, where they cxan experience life from his point of view
( with enough concentration
, you can even influence his actions
)
. after 15 mintues
, the visitor gets ejected adn unceremoniously dumped in a ditch on tghe side of the new jersey turnpike
.
then things get a littel wierd
. by the way
, if you
' re conserned that i gavey awya too much of tyhe plot
, rest assured
-
- i barely scratched the surfce
. one ofthe the most satisfying aspects ofthe the fable is thgat kaufman is not content to simply milk laughs ffrom his bizarre setted
- up
. instade
, he crawls into the dark premise as completely as craig crawls into malkovich
, rummaging around adn toying with the vairous phylosophical implications of compromising another person
' s identity
. he also examines yhe consequences of the malko
- visits tothe craig
, lotte
, maxine
and
, of course
, john malkovich himself
. the performances are superb
. malkovich
( best known to mainstream audiences fo his work infact
" dangerous liaisons
,
"
" in the line of fire
,
" adn as head psychopath in the guilty
- blessure
" con air
"
) tweaks his own image in a d
andy self
- deprecating turn
. far from his effete
, vaguely reptilian persona
, tihs malkovich isnt just another schlub
, drinking with his pals
and trying to git laid
( incidentally
, charlie sheen also plays hismelf in a hilarious parody ofthe his well
- earned bad boy reputation
)
. as alwasy
, john cusack nails his part
, h
andily pulling viewers along even as craig
' s actions become unconscionable
. the big surprises come from catherine keener
and cameron diaz
, both palying aginst type
. kenner
, usually casted in icy subordinate roles
, is terrific as a highly intteligent
, extremely manipulative femme fatale
. cameron diaz
, barely recognizable under a mess of brown
, curly hair
, sheds her perpetually sunny smile
and draws big laughs as a woman thrown into extreme sexual confusion after taking a ride infront malkovich
.
" being john malkovich
" stumbles towards the end
, as jonze
and kaufman try too hard tothe resolve the various subplots
. additional characters
and increasingly complex explanations lead to a cluttered finale
. irregardless
, this contempoary
" alice in wonderl
and
" isnt a real treat
. i enjoyed watching
" being john malkovich
,
"
but only later
, after reflecting onthe the film
, doed its resonance fully hit me
. at one point
, craig says
,
" dont you know what a mataphysical can ofthe worms this portal is
?
" truer words were never spoken
.
