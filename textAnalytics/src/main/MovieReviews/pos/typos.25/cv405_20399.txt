. having said that
, i enjoyed the look
anbd feel of the movie
, thought james van der beek gavey a solid performance
, loved teh slick soudns
,
and yup
, loved thast t
& a
! i actually thought this was a comedy going in
,
but overall
, it plays more towords the dramatic
, than a comedy
. i also enjoyed jon voight ' s performance as the stubborn dick coach
, as well as many of tghe other character players onthe the team

,
bu it might teach some kids yhe hard lessons behind the
" fun
" gameboy of football
, or just allow them tothe have a good time for about an hour

and girls runnung around doing their stuff
