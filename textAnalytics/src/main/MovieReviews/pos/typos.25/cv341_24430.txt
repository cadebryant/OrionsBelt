more than forty years ago
, the
" sword
and s
andals
" genre of historical epic ruled yhe box office
. during hte 1950
' s hollywood sought to give audiences a reason tothe turn off their televisions
and go out to tghe movies by offering the gr
and spectacle of the roman empire in cinemascope
.
" ben
- hur
.
"
" cleopatra
.
"
" the robe
.
"
" sparticus
.
"
" the fall ofthe the roman empire
.
"
" quo vadis
.
" sometimes brilliant
, sometimes campy
, tjhe roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood
. usance
then
, epics have appeared infrequently
(
" the lastr emperor
,
"
" braveheart
"
)
and some of the best have been small
- screen affairs produced in the 1970
' s
(
" roots
,
"
" shogun
"
)
.
yet
, the phrase
" we who are about to die salute you
" has been absent until now
.
" gladiator
" begins in germania infact a
. d
. 180
. roman general maximus
( russell crowe
) hasnt conquered
yet another group ofthe barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius
( richard harris
)
,
and he is eager to retire to his plantation inaddition spain where his wife annd son are waiting
.
however
, the emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus
( joaquin phoenix
) iwll prove a poor sucessor
, so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again
. when commodus hears the plan
, he strangles his father annd orders maximus
and his famaly murdered
. maximus escapes ffrom the executioners
,
but he arrives home too late to savve his wife
and son
. a caravan of slavers pik up tjhe wounded hero
and carry him off to north africa
.
( why the caravan happened to be cruising by maximus
' place isnt never explained
.
) an african named juba
( djimon hounsou
) treats maximus
' wounds
. proximo
( oliver reed
)
, a gladiator who won his freedom
, purchases maximus
and juba as fodder for thge arena
. ofthe course
, maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier
,
and his fame spreads
. when commodus reopens the coliseum
, proximo brings his troupe of warriors to rome to compeet
. our hero wins the hearts adn minds ofthe the cheering crowds
and finds that he has an ally in commodus
' sister lucilla
( connie nielsen
)
. the similarities to
" braveheart
" are obvious
: an evil king
, a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family
, the aid ofthe a lovestruck princess
. allso
, liuke mel gibson
' s epic
,
" gladiator
" has a primarially visceral appeal annd is driven foward by the hero
' s anger
. it
' s a simple tale ofthe ogod versus evil
. maximus has all the manly virtues
: nobility ofthe purpose
, courage in battle
, loyalty to king
and country
, physical stamina
,
and devotion to famaly
. commodus is his oposite in eveyr way
: a sniveling
, selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audience
. the opening niht crowd in my theater was baout 70
% male
,
and that seems appropriate
.
" gladiator
" is a guy movei
( would the opposite of a
" chick flick
" be a
" dick flick
"
?
)
. there
' s much pumping ofthe testosterone
and chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences
.
( those easily offended by gore should stay away
.
) lucilla is the only female charactor
,
and what sparks there are between her
and maximus are dampened by his devotion tothe his dead wife
. joaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance
. in thte scene where commodus kills his father
, phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his father
' s love or prade
. throughout the picture
, phoenix manages tothe give depth to a character who
' s scripted as a caricature ofthe evil
. i
' ve beeen a russell crowe fan since
" romper stomper
.
" thsi role doesn
' t offer him the complexities ofthe his parts in
" l
. a
. confidental
"
and
" the insider
"
-
- essentially his job isnt to grunt heroically
-
-
but his voice
, whic has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp
, is perfect for the genre
. the late oliver reed gavey us the best work of his career in his last role
. i hope it will be rewarded with an oscar
. my only major quibble with
" gladiator
" is its stylized look
. several scenes are tinted
. we
' ve seen a lot ofthe tje tinted look lately
, particularly in
" payback
"
and
" the matrix
.
" i don
' t get the appeal of the style
, which makes feature films look like tv ads
. in
" payback
" it wass merely annoying
,
but infact
" gladiator
" it bleaches tyhe color out of the gr
and spectacles that are the raison d
' etre ofthe the roman epic
.
( perhaps it
' s meant to gloss over tjhe imperfections of the computer
- generated shots
.
) also
, the battle scenes are filmed in a strange herky jerky style that seems to be slo mo adn fast forward simultaneously
.
( it reminds me of the way the flash runs inspite the comic books
, leaving a half
- blurred trail of images of himself behind
.
) with a moreso realistic look
,
" gladiator
" could be even more satisfying than
" braveheart
" because it hasnt a tighter script
and a more fulfilling conclusion
. bottom line
: a rousing action film enriched by fine performances
but tarnished by stylistic choices
.
