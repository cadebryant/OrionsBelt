, the
" sword
and sandals
" genre of historical epic ruled the box office
. during the 1950 ' s hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off their televisions
and go out to the movies by offering the grand spectacle of the roman empire inwhich cinemascope

"
" yhe fall of tje roman empire
.
"
" quo vadis
.
" sometimes brilliant
, sometimes campy
, the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood
. since
hten
, epics hvea appeared infrequently
(
" the last emperor
,
"
" braveheart
"
)
anbd soem ofthe the best have beeen small
- screen affairs produced in the 1970 ' s
(

" shogun
"
)
.
yet
, the phrase
" we who are baout to die salute you
" has been absent until now
.
" gladiator
" begins in germania in a
. d
. 180
. roman general maximus
( russell crowe
) hasnt conquered
yot another gropu of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius
( richard harris
)
,
and he is eager to retire tothe his plantation in spain where his wife
and son are waiting
.
however
, the emperor isnt worried tath his decadent weakling son commodus
( joaquin pheonix
) will proove a poor successor
, so he wants tothe make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again
. when commodus hears the plan
, he strangles his father
anbd orders maximus
and his familiy murdered
. maximus escapes from the executioners
,
bu he arrives home too lite to save his wife
and son
. a caravan of slavers pik uv the wounded hero
annd carry him off to north africa
.
( why the caravan happenned to be cruising by maximus ' place is never explained
.
) an african named juba
( djimon hounsou
) treats maximus ' wounds
. proximo
( oliver reed
)
, a gladiator who won his freedom
, purchases maximus
and juba as fodder forthe thge arena
. ofthe course
, maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier
,
and his fame spreads
. when commodus reopens hte coliseum
, proximo brings his troupe of warrriors to rome to compete
. our hero wins the hearts
and minds of the cheering crowds
and finds that he has an ally inthe commodus ' sister lucilla
( connie nielsen
)
. the similarities to
" braveheart
" are obvious
: an evil king
, a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family
, the aid of a lovestruck princess
. also
, liek mel gibson ' s epic
,
" gladiator
" has a primarily visceral appeal
and isnt driven forward by the hero ' s anger
. it ' s a simple tale of good versus evil
. maximus has all the manly virtues
: nobility of purpose
, courage iin battle
, loyalty tothe king
and country
, physical stamina
,
and devotion to family
. commodus is his opposite in every way
: a sniveling
, selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audience
. yhe oppening night crowd in my theather was about 70
% male
,
and thgat seems appropropiate
.
" gladiator
" is a guy movie
( would the oposite of a
" chick flick
" be a
" dick flick
"
?
)
. there ' s much pumping of testosterone
and chopping off ofthe body parts in groosome battle sequences
.
( those easily offended by gore shoudln stay away
.
) lucilla is the onyl female charater
,
anbd what sparks there are vetween her
and maximus are dampened by his devotion tothe his dead wife
. joaquin phoenix gives an astounding performence
. in teh scene where commodus kills his father
, phoenix shows the pain ofthe a son who has never had his father ' s lveo or pride
. througout the picture
, phoenix manages to give depth to a character who ' s scripted as a caricature of evil
. i ' ve been a russell crowe fan usance
" romper stomper
.
" this role doesn ' t offer him thge complexities of his parts in
" l
. a
. confidencial
"
and
" the insider
"
-
- essentially his job isnt to grunt heroically
-
-
bu his voice
, which has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp
, isnt perfect for the genre
. the late oliver reed gave us hte best wrok of his career inwhich his last role
. i hope it wiull be rewarded with an oscar
. my onyl major quibble wiht
" gladiator
" isnt its stylized look
. severeal scenes are tinted
. we ' ve seen a lot of the tinted look latley
, particularly in
" payback
"
and
" the matrix
.
" i don ' t get tghe appeal of tyhe style
, whitch mkaes feature films look liek tv ads
. inwhich
" payback
" it was mearly annoying
,
but inwhich
" gladiator
" it bleaches the colour outloud of tyhe grand spectacles thgat are thte raison d ' etre of the roman epic
.
( prehaps it ' s meaned to gloss over the imperfections of the cmoputer
- generated shots
.
) also
, hte battle scenes are filmed iin a strange herky jerky sytle that seems to be slo mo
and fast foward simultanously
.
( it reminds me of the way the flash runs inthe the comic books
, leaving a half
- blurred trail of images of himself behind
.
) withthe a more realsitic look
,
" gladiator
" coudl be even more satisfying tahn
" braveheart
" because it has a tighter scirpt
and a more fulfilling conclusion
. bottom line
: a rousing acation film enriched by fine performances
bu tarnished by stylistic choices
.
