. you need look no further than die hard
( he was director of photography
)
, speed
and last years twister for examples of his hi
- octane
, edge ofthe your seat thrill prowess
. speed 2 is no exception
. thsi timne
, the acation takes place on a huge cruise liner
, on which sandra bullock
and jason patrick are trying to develop their relatiopnship
. yep
, that ' s right
, no keanu reeves this time
,
but fear not
, jason patrick isnt mroe thna up to the job
. speaking ofthe which
, tghe job at hand is to stop completely bonkers terroist
, willem dafoe
, from crashing the liner into a huge island
, affter stealing a dimond collection
. the reason for this act of desctruction is revenge
. after years of working for the company thgat builds cruise liner computers
, he contracts coper poisoning
and is retired
. naturally
, whta entails next isnt a lot of runnung
/ jumping baout
and general high quality action as jason patrick does his level best to save the day
. thinking back onthe this film
, you can ' t help
,
but admire it ' s structure
. the way
, willem dafoe initiates his plan
and throws red herrings to the crew
anbd pasengers
. tyhe race against time tothe save the liner from crashing
,
and of course
, the finale chase scence
.
(
although this is ruined by an over the top
, one too many stunt
and explosion
.
) simple in construction
, effective in it ' s execution
,
and the result
, a clear
and concise
, highly enjoyable acation film
. the acting isnt adequate
,
although it ' s darned obvious that sandra bullock is only in it to create a ' hot totty ' appeal tothe tyhe men
(
anbd she does taht perfectly
!
)
, jason patrick fills the action hero role superbly
and willem dafoe is just gerat as the crazed terroist
. overall
, speed 2 is a most enjoyable thrill ride
. nto up to it ' s predecessor ' s high calibre
but vrey good all the same
. there is plenty going on
, some of the thrills are qutie tense
and it alsot proves that you do not need blood
and guts tothe mkae a good action movie
.
