well
, i know that stallone isnt 50 years old nowe
, bu in daylight he doesn
' t look it
! daylight isnt a gerat disaster movie
. if you
' ve seen cliffhanger
, you
' ll know stallone
' s charactor already
. a guy iwth a bad past
,
but is iin the right place at the wrong time
. a tunnel connecting newyorker york
and newyorker jersey has both sides collapses when a group of robbers collide with a truck carrying
* very
* flammable toxic waste
. a dozen or so people survive the collapses anbd the incinerating fireball
(
and what a fire ball it was
!
) stallone
, a former emergency medical sevice man
, is chauffeuring a rich couple around
, when htey triarch the outside of tyhe tunnel
, before the explosion
.
then
, 30 minutes into the movie
, boom
!
> from here on
, the plot takes a back seat
,
and we are treated to smoe of the best camera work anbd action staged
. most all thge action is plausible
and iwll hold you at teh edge of your seat
. htere are a few melodramatic parts here
,
but
, tehy tend to work out well
. there is noone general antagonist in this film
,
but the action
and suspense makes you foreget all about that
. daylight is a great film
, i saw a non
- matinee showing of it
,
and i
thought it was worth every penny
. the characterizations are mostly flat
, oney dimesional
,
but they have enough in them to get you to care for some of tyhe characters
. rob cohen
( dragonheart
) does a great job whith this film
.
