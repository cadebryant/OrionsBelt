an entertaining 2 hours awaits the audience inaddition thsi film set in the early 80
' s
. sevigny adn beckinsale play disco chicks alice
and charlotte
, who are on the lookout for love
. alice isnt mousy
, shy
, intelectual
, charlotte is bitchy
, out
- going
and fun
. we join their adventures as they go through a variety of adventures
, anbd men
, all to tghe backgorund of the local disco
. whit stillman has both written
and directed an interesting
and believable stoy
. alice anbd charlotte are both well written characters
,
and the actresses who play them aren
' t bad aswell
. sevigny delivers an honest peformance
,
and makes the audience feel for her character
. beckinsale plays extreme bitch personified
,
yet her character never becomes completelyl unlikeable
. the huge supporting cast aslo play a part inaddition making sure this movie is thoroughly intertaining
. the dialogue is sharp
and well written
, witht many funny setted pieces
. fo example
, htere
' s a great discussion about lady
& the tramp by tghe main characters
. the disco tunes playing in tjhe background also make sure tyhat this admitedly long film is good funn
. the direction is good
, bringing outloud the drama
and comedy iin tghe scenes
. bu their are slight flaws wih the movie
. firstly
,
al
though it is supposedly setted in the 80
' s
, the characters are very
, very 90
' s
. yhe way they dress annd ect hve a very 90
' s feel to them
.
al
though the male hairstyles look slightly 80
' s
, frankly teh 80
' s atmosphere just wasn
' t conveyed
, which is a shame
. also
, as maintioned above
, the film is too long
,
and smoe parts do lag
. the charm ofthe yhe characters do halp these moments
,
but generally the editing could ofthe been a bit tighter
. the plot also side
- tracks into a silly cocaine dealing bust
, hwihc seemed out ofthe palce in this movie
. fianlly
, theri are almost too many characters inwhich tyhe film
,
and dispite the runing time
, the film never realy spends enough time on them
. some of the characters are vyre slight
, which is a shame
. the conclusion
, while funny
, isnt also suprizingly weak
,
and certainly not strong enough
.
but despite theese qualms
, the lastr days of disco is a funny
, warm movie
, which is certainly worth seeing
,
and is a fitting homage to the disco era ofthe the 80
' s
. worth a look
. overall rating
