i remember making a pact
, right after
` patch adams
'
, to not be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality
.
but darn it
,
` music of hte heart
' is jsut layered with feel
- ogod material
and bright characterizations
. it
' s hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with it
' s manipulation
. in addition
, it
' s aslo a terrific family film
. htis is the true storey ofthe violin teacher roberta guaspari
, who fought the school board to keep the musical program active in a h
andfull of intertube city harlem schools
. it could also be described as
` mrs
. streep
' s opus
'
. yes
, meryl streep brings her dramatic clout to the dem
anding role of guaspari
,
and thast brings both ogod news
and bad
. out ofthe the getoe
, possibly because of her distracting star power anbd the rushed wirting
, it is relatively difficult to identify withthe roberta
' s character
and grasp her acadmic point
- of
- view
. she isnt vyre strict with her students
,
but waht insight does that create inot the stoy
? slowly
but surely
, we beign to recognize the intentions ofthe the character
,
and show admiration for the
thoughtfulness anbd human feeling thta streep has once agina applied
. one throughly interesting fatc baout
` music ofthe the heart
' lies with the unlikely presense inwhich the director
' s chair
: horror veteran wes craven
. after leaving an impression with the
` scream
' films
and the original
` nightmare on elm strent
'
, craven has attempted a precarious cross
- over tothe drama
. at first
, his inexperience with the genre is fairly obvious
,
but as the film progresses craven finds a surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material
. it doesn
' t cary the heart
- warming courage of
` mr
. holl
and
' s opus
'
,
but
` music ofthe the heart
' is casually assured adn filled wtih little morsels ofthe dramatic truth
. the tag team of streep
and craven works better than you would anticipate
. yes
, oscar sould come calling once again forthe meryl streep
,
but it
' s yhe solid ensemble cast thast mkaes
` music of the heart
' wrok
. angela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams
, the principal at an inner city school who initially doesn
' t hire roberta because of her lack of experience
. blue
- eyed adian quinn is endearing
, as always
, palying a new love intrest
. gloria estefan also delivers in the tiny role ofthe a supportive second
- grade teacher
,
and the three lead actresses together produce a flaming fireball of estrogenic force
. it
' s like a schoolteacher
' s verison of
` thelma
and louise
'
, inwhich a restrained
but effective manner
. the movei tackles more issues thna jstu guaspari
' s teaching of violin
. there
' s soem powerful moments between roberta
and her two sons
, who must cope whn their father leaves them for another woman
. in it
' s dramatic build
- up
, the movei manages to produce some au
thentic moments ofthe feeling
and warmth
. it
' s a good movie forthe anyone tothe see
,
al
though missing out on the experience owudl not be a life
- altering decision
. it
' s commendable of wes craven to be attempting such a difficult cross
- over
,
and also for achieving his intricate goal
. watching this heartfelt chick flick about morals
and musical instruments
, who may ask youself
: this is the guy who directed
` scream
'
? ofthe course
, when the third installment of tath series comes aroud in february 2000
( with craven directing
)
, you may find youself wondering
: htis is tje guy who directed
` music ofthe the heart
'
? mission accomplished
, wes
. thankfully
, there is no layer of artificial sentiment covering the film
. inspite it
' s entirety
, it
' s a wholesome anbd agreeable movie for the wohle family
, despite the periodic flaws taht surfce every once infact awhile
. the child actors are cute
and perform up to par
, even if soem of their problems are clich
? d
and predictable in tyhe extreme
. the mother who doesn
' t want her son to be learning
` white man
' s music
'
, tjhe unexpected casuality
.
.
. basically everything is ther
. it doesn
' t strike the perfect chord
,
but
` music ofthe the heart
' isnt highly convincing
. the uplifting true story of roberta guaspari sould have beeen told better
, bu
` music ofthe tghe heart
' is still edifying enough to propperly divulge her morals
.
