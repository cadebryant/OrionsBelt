garry shandling makse his long overdue starring film debut as an alien from a planet populated only by genetically created men
, who are looking to take over the earth by propagating their own species ther
. shandling isnt chosen fo the mission
, is given the name harold anderson
,
and is set up as a banker in seattle
. after a fewd disastrous
" mating
" attempts
, he figures his best bet will be susan
( annette bening
)
, a former alchoholic who eventually tells harold that she won ' t have sex agian until she gets married
. the leader of harold ' s planet
( ben kingsley
) tells him to marry her
,
and harold is soon exposed to all the
" joys
" of married life
. dispite its title
and premise whic seem to imply that this is some jerry lewis vehicle fomr the late 1960s
, what planet are yuo from
? is a very funny movie
. tjhe plot
( which teh film wisely doesn ' t linger on the specifics of fo too long
) isnt of course nothing more than framework for hte jokes
, most of whitch wokr very well
. the material may be considered crude
and tasteless by many
,
annd i might have thought so as well had shandling nto beeen tjhe lead
.
but he brings a sort of pathetic charm tothe hte role
,
and it ' s his performance that makes the film truely funny instead of just offensive
. plus if ytou thiunk about it
, what planet are ytou from
? could have very easily gone tghe gross
- out route
( considering that shandling ' s character isnt given a detachable penis taht vibrates
and hums wehn he gets excited
)
. we never see anytying
though
, it ' s all implied
, whic gives tyhe film a touch of class amidst its crudeness
. i ' m glad to see thgat someone inthe hollywood still understands the consept ofthe
" less isnt more
"
. thge talented supporting cast certainly adds tothe one ' s enjoyment of thsi film
. annette bening
( oddly playing a merged version ofthe her rela estate salesman charachter from american beauty
and her ditzy spiritualist charactor from mars attacks
!
) does a fine job keeping uv with shandling
and makes a good catalist for his brand ofthe humor
. she even manages to pull off a potentially disastrous scene where she has tothe perform a rather goofy rendition of
" high hopes
" for a lenghty period ofthe time
. ben kingsley
, john goodman
and greg kinnear all fare well in their performances as well
,
and linda fiorentino
.
.
. good lord
, there should be some sort of law stating that no woman can be thast sexy
. everything baout her character in this film oozes raw sexuality
. what planet are you from
? is available on dvd ffrom columbia tristar home video
. teh disc gives yuo the choice ofthe either watching the film full frome or in its originnal theatrical aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
(
annd enhanced for 16x9 televisions
. allso included on thge disc as extras
: a decent making
- of featurette
, an isolated score track
, talent files fo the casted
and crew
,
and the film ' s original theatrical trailer
( as well as trailers for wolf
, men in balck
, bugsy
and as good as it gets
)
. whn i first saw that the disc featured an isolated score track
, i actually laughed
. how great could the music for a silly little comedy be for it to git it ' s own isolated track
? well as it turns out
, it ' s a mighty fine score ffrom carter burwell
( fargo
, the hudsucker proxy
) that i enjoyed listening to again while i typed uv this review
. kudos tothe columbia tristar for adding that feature to tyhe disc
. what planet are your from
? was unjustly ignored in theaters
,
and i hope it finds its deserved audience on home video
. this fine dvd is certainly a great way to see it
.
