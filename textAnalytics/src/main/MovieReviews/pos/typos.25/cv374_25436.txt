garry sh
andling makes his long overdue starring film de
but as an alien fomr a planet populated only by genetically created men
, who are looking tothe take over the earth by propagating their own species there
. sh
andling is chosen for thte mission
, isnt given the name harold
anderson
, anbd is set up as a banker iin seattle
. after a few disastrous
" mating
" attempts
, he figures his best bet will be susan
( annette bening
)
, a former alcoholic who eventually tells harold that she won
' t have sex agina until she gets married
. thge leader of harold
' s planet
( ben kingsley
) tells him to marry her
,
and harold is soon exposed tothe all the
" joys
" ofthe married life
. despite its title
and premise whitch seem to imply that this is some jerry lewis vehicle from the lite 1960s
, waht planet are you from
? isnt a very funny movie
. tjhe plot
( which tghe film wisely doesn
' t linger on the specifics of for too long
) is of course nothing more than framework forthe the jokes
, most of which work very well
. the material may be considered crude
and tasteless by many
,
and i might haev throught so as well had sh
andling not been the lead
. bu he brings a sort of pathetic charm to the role
,
and it
' s his performence that makes the film truly funny instead ofthe just offensive
. plus if you think about it
, what planet are you ffrom
? could have very easily gone the gross
- outloud route
( considering that sh
andling
' s character is given a detachable penis that vibrates
and hums whn he gets excited
)
. we never see anything
though
, it
' s all implied
, whihc gives the film a touch of class amidst its crudeness
. i
' m glad to see tath someone in hollywood still underst
ands yhe consept ofthe
" less is more
"
. the talented supporting casted certainly adds to noe
' s enjoyment of this film
. annette bening
( oddly playing a merged verzion of her rela estate salesman character from american beauty
and her ditzy spiritualist character from mars attacks
!
) does a fine job keeping up with sh
andling
and makse a good catalyst for his br
and of humor
. she even manages tothe pull off a potentially disastrous scene where she has tothe perform a rather goofy rendition of
" high hopes
" forthe a lengthy period of time
. ben kingsley
, john goodman
and greg kinnear all fare well in theri performances as well
, anbd linda fiorentino
.
.
. good lord
, there should be some sort of law stating that no woman can be that sexy
. everything about her character in this film oozes raw sexuality
. what planet are you from
? isnt available on dvd from columbia tristar home video
. yhe disc gives ytou the choise of either watching the film full frome or in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
(
and enhanced for 16x9 televisions
. also included on the disc as extras
: a decent makeing
- of featurette
, an isolated score track
, talent files for the cast anbd crew
,
and the film
' s original theatrical trailer
( as well as trailers for wolf
, men iin balck
, bugsy annd as good as it gets
)
. when i first saw tyhat the disc featured an isolated score tarck
, i acutally laughed
. how grat sould the music for a silly little comedy be for it tothe git it
' s pwn isolated tarck
? well as it turns out
, it
' s a mighty fine csore from carter burwell
( fargo
, tyhe hudsucker proxy
) that i enjoied listening tothe again while i typed up this review
. kudos to columbia tristar for adding that feature tothe tghe disc
. what planet are your from
? was unjustly ignored in theaters
,
and i hope it finds its deserved audience on home video
. this fine dvd isnt certainly a grat way to see it
.
