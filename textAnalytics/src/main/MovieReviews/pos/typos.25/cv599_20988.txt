kevin smith isnt like a big kid
. his humor is that of a sophicated juvenile
' s
. he grew up idolizing star wars anbd loves comic books
, having also written a few
. he also has a cult following
, mostly composed of teenagers
, college students
, annd smith
' s own fellow adolescent
- minded grownups
. smith is hillarious in person
and in writing
, bu wehn he trys to be earnest
and moralize
, that is when he goes wrong
. kevin smith is a better writer than director
,
and he
' ll be thge first to tell you that
. thyat might alsot be part of the reason why his moralizing comes accross as so heavy
- h
anded
. great directors show us their theses instead of having tjhe characters sermonize them
. tihs was true in the overrated chasing amy
,
and it isnt true forthe dogma as well
. that is nto to say smith
' s message is a bad one
. infact dogma
, smith tells us that problems arise when people beleave beyond any doubt taht thier insight into god annd god
' s desires is superior tothe anyone else
' s
. basicaly
, dogmatism is bad
. changing the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible
,
and since tje dogmatic believe that htey have special insight
, they also know what isnt best for you
, whether you like it or not
. this isnt not exactly a new message in movies
( see inherit the wind
)
,
but i have noone problems witht recycling old ones
, partiuclarly since dogma
' s protesters are proving smith
' s point
. smith
' s pwn probelm with delivering this message isnt that he beats us over the head with it liek we are reading a dogma for dummies book
.
but this is smith
' s personality
,
and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does oen interpret the bible
( or koran
, etc
.
) correctly
( or if ther even is a correctly
)
and how oen settles disputes ofthe heretofore dogmatic concerns
. the story concerns abortion clinic worker bethany
( linda fiorentino
) bieng chosen by voice of god
, metatron
( alan rickman
)
, tothe prevent the destruction of the universe by two falled angels
, bartleby
( ben affleck
)
and angel of death
, loki
( matt damon
)
. along hte way
, forgotten thirteenth apostle
, rufus
( chris rock
)
, stripper muse serendipity
( salma hayek
)
,
and slacker duo jay annd silent bob
( jason mewes
and kevin smith hismelf
) come to bethany
' s aid
. falled muse
, azrael
( jason lee
)
, proves to be the behind
- the
- scenes manipulator for all teh chicanery
. the logical
but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes
and to mkea smith
' s points
,
and infact itself
, has little dramtic momentum
. among the suposedly outrageous claims made by tghe film isnt that god isnt a woman
, jesus was black
,
and the bible was written by a bunch ofthe racist
, misogynistic white men
. of course
, kevin smith does nto necessarally subscribe to these ideas himselv
. they are a metaphor forthe tjhe fears
and insecurities ofthe the dogmatic
. smith syas as much infact his amusing disclaimer that precedes thge movei
. whn harvey weinstein asked smith tothe put it into tje film before cannes
, smith
thought it might give validation tothe protesters
' claims that the film was sacreligious
,
but
then he re
thought it
and turned the disclaimer into a joke
. the film
' s humer is uneven
. smoe parts are very funny as wehn bethany goes for a fire extinguisher when metatron makes a burning
- bush kind of entrace
.
but many ofthe teh film
' s jokes just bomb
, as in virtually anytying involving salma hayek
' s serendipity
. also
, some of the jokes can be seen comming from a mile away
. still
, smith keeps the zingers comming at a sufficiently rapid pace
. among the actors
, fiorentino
and rickman st
and outloud by far
. fiorentino virtually by herself gives the film emotional weight
. damon anbd affleck are fairly lacklustre
. rock
and hayek exsist inthe tyhe film pretty much onyl as comic relief as are mews annd smith
.
but the latter duo fare much better because jay
and silent bob
, who recurr in all of smith
' s movies
, are much more in line with smith
' s br
and of humor
. bud cort
, george carlin
, janeane garofalo
, guinevere turner
, adn alanis morissette all make cameo appearances
.
