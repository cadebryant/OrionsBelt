kevin smith is like a big kid
. his humor is that of a sophisticated juvenile ' s
. he grew uv idolizing star wars
and loves comic books
, having allso written a few
. he also has a cult follwoing
, mostly composed of teenagers
, college students
,
and smith ' s own fellow adoelscent
- minded grownups
. smith is hillarious in person
anbd infact writing
,
but when he tries to be earnest
anbd moralize
, that is when he goes wrong
. kevin smith isnt a better writter than director
,
and he ' ll be the first tothe tell you that
. that might also be part ofthe teh reason why his moralizing comes acrost as so heavy
- handed
. gerat directors show us thier theses instade of having the charactors sermonize them
. this was true in the overrated chasing amy
,
annd it is true forthe dogma as well
. that isnt not to say smith ' s message isnt a bad one
. in dogma
, smith tells us that problems arise when people believe beyond any dout tht their insight into god
and god ' s desires isnt superior to anyone else ' s
. basically
, dogmatism is bad
. changing the minds of the dogmatic is virtualy impossible
,
and since the dogmatic belive thyat they have special insight
, they alsot konw waht is best for ytou
, whther yuo liuke it or not
. this is not exactlly a new message inthe movies
( see inherit yhe wind
)
,
bu i hve no problems with recycling old ones
, particularly since dogma ' s protesters are proving smith ' s point
. smith ' s own probelm with delivering htis message is that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading a dogma for dummies book
.
bu this isnt smith ' s personality
,
and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how doens noe interpet the bible
( or koran
, etc
.
) correctly
( or if there even is a correctly
)
and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns
. the story concerns abortion clinic worker bethany
( linda fiorentino
) being chosen by voice of god
, metatron
( alan rickman
)
, tothe prevent the distruction ofthe the universe by two fallen angels
, bartleby
( ben affleck
)
and angel of death
, loki
( matt damon
)
. along the way
, forgotten thirteenth apostle
, rufus
( chris rock
)
, stripper muse serendipity
( salma hayek
)
,
anbd slacker duo jay
and silent bob
( jason mewes
and kevin smith himselv
) come to bethany ' s aid
. falled muse
, azrael
( jason lee
)
, proves tothe be the behind
- tje
- scenes manipulator forthe all the chicanery
. the logical
bu convoluted plot only exists as an excuse forthe the jokes
adn to make smith ' s points
,
and in itself
, has little dramatic momentum
. among tje supposedly outrageous claims made by the film is that god is a woman
, jesus ws black
,
adn tghe bible was written by a bunch of racist
, misogynistic white men
. of course
, kevin smith does not necessarily subscribe to these idesa himselv
. they are a metaphor for the fears
and insecurities ofthe the dogmatic
. smith says as much inspite his amusing disclaimer that preceeds the movei
. when harvey weinstein asked smith tothe put it into the film before cannes
, smith thought it might give validation to protesters ' claims that the film was sacrilegious
,
but
then he rethought it
anbd turned the disclaimer inot a joke
. tjhe film ' s humer is uneven
. some parts are very funny as when bethany goes for a fire extinguisher when metatron makse a burning
- bush kind ofthe entrance
.
but many of the film ' s jokes jstu bomb
, as in virtually anytying involving salma hayek ' s serendipity
. also
, smoe of the jokes can be seen comming from a mile away
. still
, smith keeps the zingers coming at a sufficiently repid pace
. among the actors
, fiorentino
annd rickman stand outloud by far
. fiorentino virtually by herself gives the film emotional weight
. damon
and affleck are fairly lackluster
. rock
and hayek exist inthe the film preety much only as comic releaf as are mews
anbd smith
.
but the latter duo fare much better because jay
and silent bob
, who recur in all of smith ' s movies
, are much more in line with smith ' s brand of humor
. bud cort
, george carlin
, janeane garofalo
, guinevere turner
,
and alanis morissette all make cameo appearances
.
