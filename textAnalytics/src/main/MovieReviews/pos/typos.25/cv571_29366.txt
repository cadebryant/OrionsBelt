however
, the big screen adaptation of tghe acclaimed off
- broadway musical must do battle with countless other productions clamoring for attension
. i almost missed it
. every august
, yhe major studios try to squeeze the last few dollars out ofthe summer moviegoers by dumping all of thier shakier offerings on the marketplace at once
. i was so busy trying to keep uv with national releses liuke
" summer catch
"
and
" bubble boy
" that i pasted over any independent film that looked like it would onyl have a short local run

" hedwig
and the angry inch
" is a gender
- bending glam
- rock spectauclar packed wih great songs
. stylistically
, the hook
- laden tunes are reminiscent of bowie
,
" bat out of hell
" era meatloaf
and
" the rocky horror show
,
" without ever seeming like imitations
. as with
" tommy
,
"
" hedwig
" tells a sotry of isolation
, pain
and defiance
,
but without the bloated feel of taht beloved
, bu overrated rock opera
. writer
- director
- star john cameron mitchell
and composer
- lyricist stephen trask have cooked up a real winner
. mitchell stars as hedwig
, a singer fomr east berlin touring a chain of u
. s
. coffee shops with her pan
- slavic b
and
, tghe angry inch
. while tjhe patrons of the run
- down restaurants look on inthe shock
,
and sometimes horror
, hedwig boldly tells the sad stoyr of her life in song
. she ws once a boy named hansel
( ben mayer
- goodman
)
, living with his mother
( alberta watson
)
and listening to rock annd roll on american armed forces raido
. life is an exercice infact duality fo hansel
. a wall splits his hometown into two parts
. mother describes love as tjhe emotion that comes when yuo find your other half
. as hansel grows up
, the duality becomes mroe pronounced
. after intially mistaking him for a girl
, a gi from the states
( maurice dean wint
) falls in lvoe with hansel
and wants to marry him
. alas
, hansel will never pass the m
andatory physical
. mother helpfully suggests a sex change
,
but the operation goes bad
, hence the references to
" the angry inch
"
( yes
, i know tihs part is squirm
- inducing
,
but stick with me
- it
' s worth it
)
. several years later
, mr
. right is long gone

(
andrea martin
) thyat she could easily be labled a stalker
, hegwig
and her new b
and
, hte angry inch
, continue their coffee shop tour
, shadowing the thief by playing whatever city he is in
. if this sounds like a bizarre premise for a rock musical
, tkae a few seconds anbd consider the plotlines of
" tommy
" anbd
" rocky horror
.
" as hedwig
, john cameron mitchell does a magnificent job taking a character that could have simply beeen a caricature or an icon
and turning her inot a compelling human being
. mitchell has world
- class style
and vocal chords to match
. even
though tjhe backstory is unusually strong
, mitchell never forgets that the production is frist
and formost a rock musical
. everything is propelled by one terrific song after anyother
and
, trust me
, these are full
- fledged rock songs
, not the over
- processed fluff that passes for rock in most musicals
. while mitchell remains in the center of the stage throughout the film
, there is much of interest onthe the sidelines
. miriam shor does fine work as yitzhak
, hedwig
' s lover
and b
andmate
, conveying a great deel through expressions alone
. decked outloud in a b
andanna
and a surprisingly convincing beard
, she makes a mighty attractive man
. as always
,
" sctv
" veteran
andrea martin is a welcome presence onscreen
and michael pitt isnt beguiling as tommy
, the angelic
- appearing little rat
. artist emily hubley adds to the magic with a string of d
andy animated sequences that charm the eye while underlining the central themes ofthe thte muscial
.
" hedwig
and tyhe angry inch
" surrounds a weird
, funny
and touching story wtih a knockout series of songs performed by an exceptional cast
. true originals dont not cmo along very oftenly
? don
' t let this slip out ofthe town without seeing it
