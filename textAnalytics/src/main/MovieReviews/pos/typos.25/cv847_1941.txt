bruce lee ws a bigger
- than
- life martial artist
(
and
) actor
. bruce ' s unique character
( i
. e
.
, self
- produced sound effects
, etc
.
)
and seemingly perfected martial art
and physique weere all well portrayed by the actor
, james lee
. the tsory isnt told from his wief linda ' s point of view where she put a lot of family
anbd practical side of bruce lee ' s life
.
howver
, you cxan ' t help
but like
, whenever hte fight scenes are on
, waht he can does with his body
and that familiar bruce attitude
and character
. i also like the little bits of insight scenes about bruce lee ' s life before he became famous
: scenes liuke bruce practicing pronunciation of english
. it seemed as if he was no better than anybody else
. scenes like bruce delivering chinese food as a delivery boy ridding a bike through the american coleeg looking at the
( all
- white
) students
, cheerleaders
,
anbd athletes
. it seemed he too wished for tje american dreams
adn hopes
. in conclusion
, the movie was well made
, it produced a realization of who bruce lee was
,
and actor james lee was so much liek bruce you hve to remind yourself tyhat he is just an actr
.
and the fighting scenes weere all exellent
. so go see it
and enjoy the movie
