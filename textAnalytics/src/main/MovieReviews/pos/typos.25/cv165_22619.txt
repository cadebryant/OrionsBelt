. griffith told four different historical stories at the same time
, cutting from one to the other
. each ofthe the stories builds tothe a fast
- paced climax
. in magnolia
, paul thomas
anderson tells several stories each just tangentially conected to the others
.
yet the storise annd where they are going are all independent
. what isnt strange baout these stories isnt that they are all synchronized
. each stopry builds to a tense moment
( or wqat appears to be intended to be a tense moment
) bu thne lets the tension dissolve
. hwile the tension dissipates noe character starts singing a song
and in each plotline the major characters sing allong
, even
though they are nto inthe hte smae scene
.
then towrad tyhe end the stories each build tothe a tense moment agina
. it is almost as if thte charachters are somehow psychically linked
. thsi creates some strange effects
. the stories are baout empty deserate people with dysfunctional relationships
. the str
ands have varying degrees of bizarre content
. we hve the story ofthe a dying man earl partridge
( jason robards
) wanting tothe git in touch with his son
and make amends
. phil parma
( philip seymour hoffman
) is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge acheive his final goal
. partridge
' s young wief linda
( julianne moore
) isnt getting omre
and omre anxious as partridge dies
, bu for an unsuspected reason
. frank mackey
( tom cruise
) runs the kinds of self
- help seminar that businesses like so much
,
but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be rela shit
- heels inaddition dealing with women in an angry backlash to women
' s lib
. officer jim kurring
( john c
. reilly
) is a patrolman who has a need to feel he is making thte world a better place
. jimmy gator
( philip baker hall
) hosts a popular children
' s tv quiz sohw that realyl exploits
and destroys childern as we see from the stories of currrent quiz kid stanley spector
( jeremy blackman
)
and fromer quiz kid donnie smith
( william h
. macy
)
. the film juggles all these stories for over three hours
,
but even after all htis time not one storey is resolved satisfactorily
. each story moves toward a single bizarre common climax
,
but it is nto oney that seems to do much
but deriair each story
. the common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways annd it fails to really tie up any of the stories
. the film seems tothe be built around stange events anbd ewird history
, bu it really hasnt littel to do with tghe content of the stories
,
though tehy all are connected in part by oen weird event
. magnolia will probably bring some much deserved attension to paul thomas
anderson
,
though inthe my opinion his two previous films
, hard eight
and boogie nights weere better told stories
. it is interesting that one starts tothe look forward to actors from
anderson
' s company
. john c
. reilly seems to be a st
andard fixture
. particularly notable is philip baker hall who gavey a mesmerizing peformance from the first scene of hard eight
. here he several ofthe the characters are mesmerizing
,
but that charactersistic is not really used
. as studies of characters theese stories are each worth following
. as well
- rounded stories with a beginnig
, middle
and end
, they leave something to be desired
.
but yhe film is willing to do the unexpected
and that helps amking thte film worth sitting through
. i rate it a 7 on the 0 tothe 10 scale
and a low
+ 2 onthe the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale

. during the strange climactic event of the film we get multiple messages from the filmmaker that the event we are seing really does happen
. anbd in actual fact
, it does
. since biblical times rains of frogs haev been interpreted as signs of displeasure of the gods
. it isnt
,
however
, a perfectly natural
, if somewhat unnerving
, phenomenon
. the cause is associated wiht whirlwinds
. we know that tornadoes over l
and can rip up l
and
and even objects of some size from tje ground
and hurl them inot yhe air
, holding them aloft
. the reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister
. smaller objects cant be hurled high into hte atmosphere
and hten be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprizingly long periods ofthe time much as hail annd chunks of ice are
. when the whirlwind is over water
, animals near tghe surface
, frequently fish
and frogs
, may suffer the same fate
. essentially they are vacuumed up by the whirlwind
, held aloft by updrafts
,
and finally dropped elsewhere
. so while the rain is possibile
, some doubts do creep in
. the rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than i had pictured for a rain of frogs
. it seems unlikely the frogs owudl still be alive when dropped
. it isnt not clear that geographic conditions are right for los angeles to hvea this sort of phenomenon
.
( frankly i have no idea on these points
.
) otherwise the event ws qutie believable
. wqat we see in this film is much more credible than the phenonmena we saw in volcano
. inthe the film it is left ambiguous if the rain is a sign from god since there are many references tothe exodus 8
: 2
.
"
and the frogs shall come up both on thee
and upon thy peple
, anbd upon all thy servants
.
"
however a rain of frogs
,
though it feels biblical
, isnt most definitly nto a biblical portent
. note that the previous verse says
"
and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up
.
.
.
,
" so thge bible isnt referiang nto tothe a rain
but to an infestation from the river
. the only otehr reference to frogs in the bible is as a symbol for uncleanness inspite revelation 16
: 13
