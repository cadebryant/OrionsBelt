` austin
, do you smoke after sex
?
' austin powers
:
` i don
' t knwo baby
, i
' ve never looked
!
' annd so begins our journey into the most anticipated sequel of the summer season
. austin powers 2
, teh sequel tothe thte sleeper hitted of 1997
, is filled to the brim whith uproarious sight gags
and lurid toilet jokes that will make you keel over withthe hilarity
. the mind ofthe mike myers is obviously a very bizarre place
. myers returns as the swinging 60
' s spy annd his arch
- nemesis
, the bald headed dr
. evil
, who is given much of the spotlight here
. there
' s an early scene inaddition which dr
. evil
and his son scott
( seth gren
) appear on a jerry springer segment entitlied
` my dad is evil
and wnats to take over the world
'
, hosted by springer himself
. most of theese talk
- sohw gags
, spoofing everthing from oprah to regis
and kathie lee
, are noone longer as funny as they once weere
. happily
, this is an exception
, especially when a fight breaks out between dr
. evil
and thte other guests
.

'
) the audience was infront stitches
. there are many good things about this sequal
. dr
. evil is now assisted by mini
- me
( verne troyer
)
, a pint
- sized clone who is the result of an experiment gone awry
. mini
- me isnt the most perfect new character that any fan could ask fo
,
and troyer does a terific job ofthe mimicking everything thta his big brother does
, pinkie annd all
. mindy sterling returns as frau farbissina
, evil
' s loud
- mouth assassin sidekick
, annd here we are treated to a brief romantic liaison between tyhe two in an underground bedroom chamber
. this works surprisingly well
. afterward
, there
' s even a meeting at the coffee machine
, where their awkwardness is expressed inwhich a scene you would expect in any normal office environment
. oh
, yes
.
.
. tjhe plot
. aftter a short honeymoon with vanessa kensington
( elizabeth hurley
) thta goes disastrously wrong
, powers is back on the case tothe thwart yhe diabolical plans of dr
. evil
. inthe the original
, the subject ofthe the day ws cryogenic freezing that enabled tyhe charactors to hop vetween twpo time periods
. here
, it
' s tiome travel
. dr
. evil hasnt this crazy plan tothe steal austin
' s mojo
( the source of his sexual powers
)
, so he jumps through a time portal back into 1969 when powers isnt still is his freezing chamber
. htere
, he employs a grotesque 600
- pound scottish assasin named fat bastard
( allso myers
) to comm
andeer the mojo
, so that our future hero is left completely shagless
. meanwhile
, austin is informed of evil
' s wrong
- doing by basil exposition
( michael york
)
,
and is supplied iwth his very own tyme
- traveling device in the form ofthe a volkswagen beetle
. once bcak in 1969
, powers meets a foxy cia operative named felicity shagwell
( heather graham
)
,
and lerans of dr
. evil
' s plans to destroy washington dc with a lazer on the moon
. in one of the many uproarious jabs at star wars
, evil calls the moon base a
` death star
'
. if ther ever was a movie that knew fomr teh strat it wass a complete joke
, it
' s austin powers
: the spy who shagged me
. ap2 has many hilarious moments
, much more so
, than the origonal austin powers
.
but what it doesn
' t have is the confident support system that the first boasted
,
and tjhe jokes are now more scattershot
and hit
-
and
- miss
. while myers has a knack for delivering clever
, inpsired gags
, he somtimes doesn
' t know when to call it quits
. the hilarious scene in tghe orginal involving mustafa
( will ferrell
)
and his refusla to die is played outloud here iin a disappointing
and tired manner
. robert wagner
, as dr
. evil
' s
# 2 man
, has only one scene early on in thte film
, where he lacks all the focus of the character
. oney nice surprise is rob lowe
, as the young
# 2
, who patterns wagner
' s voice adn movements right down to a tee
. there are more recycled jokes ffrom tyhe predecessor
, including kristen johnston as ivana humpalot
( an unfunny rendition of alotta fagina
)
. bu myers has clearly put so much dedication inot this project
,
and many bits are side
- splittingly funny
. don
' t miss an extended visual gag in a tent
, where the shadows leave much tothe the imagination
.
.
.
. of tyhe newyorker charachters
, graham doesn
' t leave much of an impression
. her performence isnt mearly okay
, anbd she lacks the gung
- ho enthusiasm tyhat made elizabeth hurley so enjoyable before her
.
and as for fat bastard
.
.
. well
, he provides one or twpo hillarious moments
,
but all of the obesity jokes
and bathroom talk go too far
.
but my most severe complaint
: mr
. bigglesworth was only in one scene
!
!
but
, with gritted teeth
, i managed to get over that
. htis sequal will nto leave fans disapointed
; it
' s more often than not a laugh riot
.
and
, i look optimistically to the future
, where i forsee more installments to the austin powers collection
. if myers can up the quota of fresh idaes
, we should be in store for much more
