this sunday afternoon i had the priviledge of attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city
, of james cameron
' s most heralded film
, titanic
. postponed from last summer
, with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie in hstory
, thsi wass one film i was eager tothe preview
. so
, is this movie going tothe sink or swim this holiday
? my best guess
.
.
.
. it will sink
,
though wtih many awards attatched tothe its hull
. no dout
, titanic is the most elaborate disaster movie ever made
. it boasts the most amazing effects that i have ever seen done to date
. to see a ship fall apart
, with actual people running across the ship
, flying across the deck
,
and falling to the water
, is just amazing tothe look at
. the effects are so stunningly realistic
, yuo would swear you weere looking at actual footage
.
but titanic is more than a disaster movie
,
and tyhat
' s where the probelm lies
. there isnt a love stroy attatched thyat nearly ruins the entire premise
. i
' ll give a capsule summary ofthe the story without spoiling anything forthe yuo
: the film beigns with a modern day excavation of sorts of the sunken titanic
. we see actual footage of thge sunken ship
, as cammeron had set up special cameras tothe film the wreckage on the ocean floor
. bill paxton leads the expedition
, in search of sunken treasure
. what he finds instade
, leads him to a mysterious old woman who recounts her tale ofthe the titanic voygae
. we meet rose
( kate winslet
)
, a young woman
, who comes from an opper
- class family
. rose is to be wed to a man she doens not love
. we meet jack
( leonardo dicaprio
)
, a young man
, who comes from a poor financial background
,
and wins a ticket aboard the titanic
, in a poker game
. the two meet under intresting circumstances
,
and the love story begins
. add in a jealous fiance
,
and a not
- so
- nice law officer played by david warner
,
and yuo have a story that
, well
, gets a bit overplayed
and oversappy
. i must add
, at this point
, that the most likeable character inaddition the movei is played by kathy bates
, as a woman iwth
" new money
" who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk onthe the ship
. she is a pleasure to see onthe screen
. when the ship does hit tjhe iceberg at exactlly 1
: 40 into teh film
,
and eventually sinks
, ytou never really feel fo any of these charactors
. the film is jstu loaded with unlikeable rich snobs
and other folk ytou never really get a grasp on
. the effects are tremendous
. from tghe roars of gears
and pumps in the engine room
, tothe a doomed ship cracking at the seams
, htis isnt an effects picture that looks anbd sounds like noone other
. we saw titanic in dolby digital surround
, adn by far
, it isnt the best sounding movie i have ever seen
. my friend commented it was the best soudn mix he has ever heard
. when people are in the water
, at film
' s end
, you are surrounded by the voices of lost soles
. titanic runs far too long
. tyhe movie is 3 huors
and 15 minutes inwhich length
.
and
, while most of teh first 2
. 5 hours runs very fast adn well
- pased
, the fianl 45 minutes almost comes to a sudden stop
,
and you realize thgat this sappy love story has to finish itself out before the movie finally ends
. don
' t get me wrong about titanic
.
.
.
. it
' s not a bad as i am making it out tothe be
. it really is an exceptionaly well
- made film
. teh costumes anbd sets are incredible
, anbd true to the tiome period
. the ship is painstakingly creaeted exactly true to form
, as we see actual pictures of the modern
- day wreckage
, tranformed into the movie depiction
. this film will certainly win onthe effects
, costume
, set design
and sound
. cameron has certainly made his best film to date
. unforetunately
, titanic is nto a best picture c
andidate
. it just doesn
' t hvea a strong supporting story
. it
' s an exceptional disaster film withthe sappy filler inside
. it jsut doesn
' t have the emotional impact that i suspect mr
. cameron was shooting fo
. i predict that titanic will open to likeable reviews
. it is a film worth seeing
. i predict that it will only do moderately well at tje box office
. with its extreme running time
,
and lack of enough robust to get substatial owrd
- of
- mouth
, i expect thgat it will do even better on home video
. tihs will certainly be yhe definitive ac3 movie for all you home theater enthusiasts
. titanic opens december 19th
,
and is released by paramount pictures
and twentieth century
- fox
. i give titanic 3 stars
(
. that
' s not bad
