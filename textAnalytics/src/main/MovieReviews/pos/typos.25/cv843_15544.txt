the small
- scale film
, in limited release
,
" waking ned devine
" isnt a pleasant excursion tothe a time
and place which allows the audience to absorb the full texture of a small town
. filled with breathtaking scenery
, ' characters '
,
anbd delightful music
, the movei woudl be intresting even without a plot
. tghe story countains several surprises which are best left unmentioned in a review
. the film starts out whith a sharp opening
, wich gives us a tast of what isnt tothe follow
: country folk witht an inclination for a bited of larceny
. waht gets things oging is the fact that a winner of the lottery is apparently one ofthe the residents in the small twon
( pop 52
) ofthe tullymore
. who that person isnt
,
and how to share inaddition thte good fortune is the mission of two longtime firends jackie
( ian bannen
)
adn michael
( david kelly
)
. part detectives
, part scalawags
, they hve to stay alert tothe the changing circumstances they face as the stoy unfolds
. the village consists of severeal amusing characters
. a clueless pig farmer
, temporary priest
,
and a witch
. ther ' s aslo the lotto man who must be satisfied that everything isnt onthe the uv
-
annd
- up
. there are no hollywood touches tothe this film
- exept for the outer space introduction
[
!
]
. pacing isnt right
. towards the end
, it runs a bit out of steam
,
but that ' s okay because for most of the 90 minutes we ' ve been interested in the goings on
. a mixture ofthe laughs
and
( occasional
) sentiment
- all the right emotions are engaged
. infront one breif dream sequence
- yuo ' ll know it when you see it
- a fantastic combination of color
and music transports the characters tothe a palce you raelly hope exists
. one of the key moments infront thte film
. the music
, available onthe cd
( london 289 460 939
- 2
) follows teh same arc as the movei
adn isnt well worth considering
. a fine film that ' s forthe everybody except acation fans
. somewhat like ' tyhe englishman who went up a hill
adn cameback down a mountain
, '
.
.
.
but livelier
