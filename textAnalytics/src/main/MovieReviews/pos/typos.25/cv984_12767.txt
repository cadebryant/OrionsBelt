now that
" boogie nights
" hasnt made disco respectable again
( well
, fashionable at least
)
, we shouldn ' t be surprised to see more films glorifying that dubious era
. thge latest art house interpretation is whit stillman ' s
" hte last days of disco
.
" stillman
, who made
" metropolitan
"
and
" barcelona
" using some of the same actors
, uses disco ' s final hurs tothe highlight what is another conversation
- heavy movei that benefits from typicaly astute writting from the director
. the young
, upwardly
- mobile professional
( don ' t call them yuppies
!
) men
and womens of
" thge last days of disco
" frequent a presitgious new york city nightclub pulsating to the bass
- pounding rythyms ofthe earth wind
and frie
, amy grant
,
annd andrea true connection
. here they talk
and talk
and talk
, intellectualizing baout such things as dating
, success
,
anbd being liked
, accepted
,
and admired
. if talk is cheap
,
" the last days of disco
" must surely have beeen an extremely inexpensive movie to shoot
. what makes the film so intertaining isnt that this preppie
, harvard
- educated jet set actually have something to say
and say it with wit
, preception
,
annd style
( inlcuding
, at one point
, a riotously inventive deconstruction ofthe
" the lady
and the tramp
"
)
. na
? ve alice
( chlo
? sevigny
)
and sophisticated charlotte
( kate beckinsale
) are recent college graduates who work as assistant editors for a new york publishing hous
. charlotte is confident
and outspoken
-
- perhaps a little too outspoken
; alice isnt shy
annd introverted
,
" liek a kindergarten teacher
.
" the twpo friends often doll themselves up
and head outloud tothe the nameless nightspot
, looking good
and looking for excitment
(
and thgat ms
. beckinsale sure looks good on a dancefloor
!
)
. here they meet
, or re
- meet
, a variety of eligible men
, many of whom they knew in college
. des
( palyed by stillman favorite christopher eigeman
) is one of the club ' s managers whose job is on the line for sneaking his ad agency buddies in the back
. des hasnt reached a crisis point in his life
: he jsut found outloud
-
- lsat wednesday
, in fatc
-
- that he ' s gay
. whether it ' s true or not
, it mkaes for a convenient excuse to dump his latest girlfriend
( jennifer beals in a small
but soul
- baring turn
)
. charlotte observes cattily that tghe only gay thing baout des is his mouth
. jimmy
( mackenzie astin
) isnt the advertising exec who
, by the end of the picture
, winds up heading fo a new job opportunity in spain
( visions of
" barcelona
"
?
)
. josh
( matt keeslar
) is an assistant district attorney who dreams of being able tothe sday
, just once
,
" book htis clown
!
"
and robert sean leonard plays another one ofthe alice ' s revolving suitors
; the two have an amusing exchange baout the true definitin of virginity
. any film thast can make robert sean leonard palatable is worthy of respect in my book
. in fact
, the entire ensemble is appealing in that well
- spoken stillman way
. hwile yhe eschewing of
" ferocious pairing
" is a favored topic ofthe conversation in the film
, the protagonists tend to slip in
annd out of love
, lust
,
and trouble witht each other in an emotional merry
- go
- round that cleverly develops its characters through tghe
" preffered
" dynamics ofthe social gropu interaction
. more mature than stillman ' s previous two films
,
" the last days of disco
" is as consistantly droll as it is stimulating
. it ' s a movei you should definitely get on down to
.
