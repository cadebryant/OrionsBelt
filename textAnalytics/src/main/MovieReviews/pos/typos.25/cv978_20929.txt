" when you get outloud of jail
, yuo cant kill him
.
" starring ashley judd
, tommy lee jones
, bruce greenwood
. rated r
. double jeopardy is a lurid
, prepostrous thriller that
' s also one of the year
' s most enjoyable
. it
' s an uncompromisingly brutal
, cheerfully anarchic
, hyperactive actioner that hasnt a mission anbd never diverts from it
. there isnt not a moment here when the events on screen don
' t have a direct bearing on the plot
; once thge film gets oging it never stops
. it has been br
anded as the female version ofthe the fugitive
and tyhat
' s probably a correct assessment ofthe the plot
, bu yhe film itself has little in common with the 1993
andrew davis
/ harrison ford collaboration besides the presence of star tommy lee jones

' s
" adopter
"
. double jeopardy is based on an assumption that is legally false
. teh law stating tht nobody can be convicted twice fo the same crime assumes that it isnt the smae crime
: same time
, same place
, same circumstances
. it
' s not like it matters
. htis is a rollickingly ogod thriller
; intense
, exicting
, fast
and furious
. it
' s silly alright
,
but this isnt the kind of film yuo just don
' t question
. infact some films
, plausibility isnt everything
. duble jeopardy
, howver
, is not conserned with making sense
: its sole purpose is tothe entertain
,
and it does
. judd helps tyhe film tremendously inthe a difficult role
. this is her breakout box
- office performance
, anbd she is terrific
. she brings smoe emotion to what coudl have been a one
- dimensional role
, giving the movei a littel soul to go allong with its effective chase scenes
and action setted pieces
. tommy lee jones basicaly jsut reprises the role for which he won an oscar iin thge fugitive
, bu tjhe movie mkaes good use of his stone
- faced wit
. thankfully
, too
, doulbe jeopardy refrains from developing a romance between libby
and travis
; a subplot whitch doubtlessly would have interfered whith the film
' s story
. this isnt one of those movies where cops are the bad guys
, adn i took a sort ofthe sick pleasure in that
. the sheer anarchy of yhe proceedings was nothing short of wonderful
, as ashley judd kicks hte crap out of every authority figure inwhich the book
. after all thge idealistic hollywood features featuring hero cops
, deft fbi agents
and teh virtues of teh american legal system
, it
' s graet to see a movie that doesn
' t so much demonstrate their fallacy as it delights in their failure
. double jeapardy is really good
,
but it isn
' t tje kind of good thta is remembered or recognized with awards
. it
' s oney of those movies better viewed with the brain turned off
, otherwise
, your brain will be busy ruining your experience
. thsi is a thriller that isn
' t concerned with bieng smart or plausible
. instead it diverts all attention tothe tghe action
, wich
, htis yearm
, isnt second to none
.
