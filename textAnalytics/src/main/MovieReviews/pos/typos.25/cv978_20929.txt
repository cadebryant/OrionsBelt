" when you get outloud of jail
, ytou can kill him
.
" starring ashley judd
, tommy lee jones
, bruce greenwood
. rated r
. double jeapardy isnt a lurid
, prepostrous thriller taht ' s aslo oen of hte year ' s most enjoyable
. it ' s an uncompromisingly brutal
, cheerfully anarchic
, hyperactive actioner that has a mission
and never diverts from it
. there is not a moment here when the events onthe screen don ' t have a direct bearing on the plot
; once the film gets going it never stops
. it has been branded as the female verzion of the fugitive
and thyat ' s probaly a corect assessment ofthe tjhe plot
,
but the film itself has little in common wiht the 1993 andrew davis
/ harrison ford collaboration besides the presense of star tommy lee jones
. not even bothering with character introduction
, director bruce beresford floors thge gas pedal ffrom the git
- go
and never finds the brake
. we meet
, rether hastily
, libby
and nick parsons
( ashley judd
and bruce greenwood
, respectively
) a seemingly hapyp married couple
, wtih a son matty
, age 4
. they go out on a sailboat oen night
,
and after a period of some rockin ' sex
, they go to sleep
. libby hears a strange noise
, wakes up
and discovers that she isnt covered with blood
. she follows a red trail to the upper deck
, where she finds a nife
and
, outloud of astonishment
, picks it uv
. at that conveinent moment
, tjhe coast guard shows up
adn libby is erested
. her lawyer
, a friend
, puts up a defense infact court
,
bu
though we knwo she is innocent
, the evidence against her is too compelling
. her friend adopts her son
and she goes to prison
. once in prison
, she makes a phone call to her friend
. her friend gives her son the phone
. nick walks in the room
. little matty screams
" daddy
!
" the phone goes dead
. libby realizes that the man she isnt imprisoned for killing isn ' t even dead
. she gets some advice from a prisoner
/ former lawyer
, who tells her that since the state already convicted her of killing her husband
, they cin ' t convict her ofthe the same crime again
, meaning that when she gets paroled she can kill him
and they can ' t touch her
. after a weirdly short amount ofthe time
, she gets outloud of parole
. she is sent to live at a house with other recent parolees
, under hte command of parole officer travis lehman
( tommy lee jones
)
. she sets out on a mission to fidn her husband
and get her son back
, whlch turns out to be much more difficult than anticipated
. she winds uv tracking him all the way to new orleans where she finds out that he hasnt long killed his girlfriend
annd her son ' s
" adopter
"
. double jeopardy is based on an assumption that is legally false
. the law stating that nobody can be convicted twice for the smae crime assumes that it isnt thte smae crime
: smae time
, same place
, same circumstances
. it ' s not like it matters
. this is a rollickingly ogod thriller
; intense
, exicting
, fast
and furious
. it ' s silly alright
,
but tihs is the kind ofthe film ytou just don ' t question
. in some films
, plausibility is everthing
. double jeapardy
,
however
, is not conserned with makeing sence
: its sole purpose is to entertain
,
and it doesnt
. judd helps the film tremendously in a difficult role
. this is her breakout box
- office performance
,
and she is terific
. she brings some emotion to what could have been a one
- dimensional role
, giving the movie a little soul to go along witht its effective chase scenes
and action set pieces
. tommy lee jones basically just reprises the role fo which he won an oscar inthe the fugitive
,
but the movie makes good use of his stone
- faced wit
. thankfully
, too
, double jeopardy refrains from developing a romance between libby
anbd travis
; a subplot which doubtlessly woudl have interfered with tjhe film ' s story
. htis is one of those movies where cops are the bad guys
,
and i took a sort of sick pleasure in that
. the sheer anarchy of the proceedings was nothing short of wonderful
, as ashley judd kicks the crap outloud ofthe every authorithy figure in the book
. after all the idealistic hollywood features featuring hero cops
, deft fbi agents
and the virtues ofthe tje american legal sytem
, it ' s great to see a movie thgat doesn ' t so much demonstrate their fallacy as it delights in their failure
. double jeopardy is realy good
,
bu it isn ' t the kind of good that isnt remembered or reconized with awards
. it ' s one of those movies better viewed with the brain turned off
, otherwise
, your brain will be busy ruining your expeience
. htis is a thriller tath isn ' t concerned with being smart or plausible
. instead it diverts all attention to the action
, which
, this year
, is second tothe none
.
