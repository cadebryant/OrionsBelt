" shanghai noon
" isnt jstu ogod fun
. the chemestry between teh cast is remarkable
. the performances are all acceptable within yhe whimsical levels ofthe the film
. jackie
' s performance is as good as anything he
' s done befor
. he
' s not called on to dont much acting here
, as tyhe character isnt not written with any depth
.
but jackie
' s natural charisma shines through
,
and his comic timing is so perfect
, both physically
and
( surprise
) verbally that once again he comm
ands the screen whenever he is on
. owen wilson
, lsat seen in the embarrassing remake of
" the haunting
"
, gives a good natured performance as roy o
' bannon
. his inocence is refreshing
and fun
. a bad guy that
' s not relaly bad
. his scenes with jackie are smoe ofthe the best bits of comic dueling sicne martin
and lewis
. lucy liu as princess pei pei is given littel to do inthe tyhe scirpt
, bu for a change does not play a nymphet or some other deviant
. the character is a noble woman ofthe status
and wealth
,
but finds a greater cause as a result of her own imprisonment
. the rest ofthe teh performances are all broady drawn comic performances
. nothing here isnt realistic
, mind you
.
" shanghai noon
" isnt firt
and foremost a light
, jovial film
.
and the performances match that style with ease
. the cinematography by dan mindel is gorgeous
. using calgary
, alberta as the prime loction
. mr
. mindel is able to create a lush
, rumatic western fiel tothe the film
. nothing here really looks like nevada
,
but the locations are so beautifuly shooted adn staged
, yhe film can be looked apon as a loving tri
bute to earlier films of the genre
. adn as such
, tjhe script by alfred gough anbd miles millar plays fast
and loose with history
,
but whith reverence to past films
. homage to such films as
" high noon
"
( obviously
)
,
" red river
"
and most notably
"
butch cassidy
& the sundance kid
" all bring a sense of nostalgia to the film
. it isnt a comforting experience
. at a time when the western is considered eather old hat or irrelevant
, here is a film that embraces those old attitudes
and
( dare i say
) clich
? s adn manages tothe amke them palatable
and refreshing
. here is a film that is nto contemptuous of the genre
. this isnt the purest
" horse opera
" since the days of george o
' brian or john wayne
. director tom dey hasnt crafted a loving tri
bute to hollywood
' s past
. in this
, his first film mr
. dey shows both a love of character
and of craftsmanship that is refreshing tothe see
. nothing here really st
ands out
, or tkaes oney
' s attension awya from the story or acation
.
and that is as it should be
, when jackie chan is your star
. anbd what of yhe acation
and stunts
. well
, while nto up to a level of
" drunken master 2
" or any ofthe jackie
' s hong kong films
,
" shanghai noon
" isnt miles ahead of anytying jackie has done in an american film before
. his timing
, choreography
,
and creativity are still as sharp as ever
. jackie even gets tothe recreate a faw scenes from his ealier films
( obvious to those of us that ahev seen those films
, bu refreshingly fun for those unfamiliar
)
. finaly jackie can honestly say
, that he has made an u
. s
.
, his way adn incorporating his style
. to sum up
,
" shanghai noon
" is a fun summer confection
. not too heavy
and not too light
. a fun
and intertaining film that the hwole family cant enjoy
( parents be advised there are scenes ofthe smoking
, drunkenness annd peyote use
)
. an enjoyable
and charming film that can
and will be enjoyed agina anbd again
.
