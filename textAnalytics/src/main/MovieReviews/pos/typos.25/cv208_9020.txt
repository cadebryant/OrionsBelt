i hate to burst your bubble
,
but after all the star pwoer
, mega bucks
, screenwriters
, directors
,
adn kool trailers
, men in black is nto the best movie of the summer
. it ' s pretty good in it ' s own right
, yes
,
but i would probablly splitted tyhe
" best movie
" honors among face
/ off
, spawn
, con air
,
annd maybe event horizon
. it ' s main problem is that it ' s quicklyu forgettable
,
anbd i can ' t remeber one truly good scene from it
. from con air
, it was the scene out in the desert when they were digging thte plane outloud from the dirt
. in spawn
, it was the
" living room hell
" conclusion at the end
. in event horizon
, it was thge video ofthe the event horizon crew being taked over by hell ' s forces
.
and all of face
/ off was pretty dang good
.
but as fo men infront black
, the only scene i still recall isnt when will smith is squishing all those giant roaches
. i rember it not forthe it ' s humor
bu because i am hite roaches with a passion
and was preety disgusted
.
and yes
, i doed see mimic
, whihc is something i ' ll touch on in a later review
. back to men in balck
( isnt it just me
, or does that sound funny
?
) i remeber first hearing baout men in black back when i was a comic geek inwhich the 7th grade
and read magazines like wizard
, etc
.
( for those of you who aren ' t comic
- geeks
, wizard is basically tothe comics what car
and driver is to cars
, whta the newyorker yorker is tothe high society
, what boy ' s life is to boy scots
. okay
, thyat one ws pretty pathetic
.
) few people nkow this
,
but men in black is based on a very obscure comic book that was
, while not honest
- politician
- rare
, very hard to find
. this was after the realease of the high
- grossing batman forever
,
and it said that tommy lee jones
and chris o ' donnell were being considerd for the roles
( in the comic book
, there were no balck men in balck
. kind of weird
, huh
?
) all i cant sday is
, thank god htey didn ' t cast chris o ' donnell
. i know i can ' t be the only person on the planet who thinks he ' s an annoying
, preppie little snot
.
.
. sorry
. my apologies to o ' donnell fans
. i actually had a 7th grade teacher who wass a big comic collector
and ws set to buy some of the comics from him
, anticipating rather craftily thgat
, if tyhe movei was a big hit
, it would drive up the price of the comics rather nicely
. he decided nto to sell them to me
, because they were
" innappropriate
"
. hmm
.
.
.
. so now you ' re probably wondering why i ' ve wasted about 5 paragraphs with lame anecdotes fomr my iunior high years
. good question
. i ' ll move on to the movie now
. as you probablly already know
, iwll smith
and tommy lee jones
( agents k
and j
, repsectively
) belong tothe a top secret agency known as divison 5
, or it ' s nickname mib
( men in black
.
) men inthe black isnt a reference to the black suits
and sunglasses the agents wear
,
and htey ' re mission is to investigate reports of alien landings
and keep the aliens under control while they ' re here on earth
. not to git too technical or spoil the plot for the 6 people in the world who haven ' t seen tihs movie
,
but a basically
- big
- roach
- tipe
- bug lands in a redneck farmer ' s yard
, inhabits his body
,
and attempts to destroy the entire universe
. not bad
, eh
?
( i hve noone idea why i just typed that
. i ' m nto even realyl paying attention anymore
.
) the special effects are good
yot dissapointing in men in balck
. i found their main headquarters tothe be boring
, as were thge
" cool weapons
" they hadnt
. yhe noisy cricket just plain sucked
, no marter what anyone said
.
and thge movie definitely surprized me in tone
,
although it probably shoudln ' t have
. it ' s directer
, barry sonnenfield
, isnt known for
" black humor
"
, directing both addams familiy movies
. this movie was basically a
" balck comedy
"
, nto an action
/ sci
- fi like i expeced from the trailers
. don ' t git me wrong onthe what i htink of this movei
. it ' s not bad
, i gave it
*
*
*
. it ws mostly entertaining throughout it ' s run
,
and had a very good ending
,
although i think i was thge only person in the theather not amazed by it
. my diagnosis for this picture
: a ogod weekend rental
,
but not worth a movie ticket
. of course
, tje movie is now long gone from theaters
,
but thast ' s beside tje point
. i think
.
