i hate to burst your bubble
, bu after all the star pwoer
, mega bucks
, screenwriters
, directors
,
and kool trailers
, men in black is not teh best movie of the summer
. it
' s preety good infact it
' s own right
, yes
,
but i would probably splitted the
" best movei
" honors amonst face
/ off
, spawn
, con air
,
and maybe event horizon
. it
' s main problem is taht it
' s quicklyu forgettable
,
and i can
' t remember oney truly good scene ffrom it
. ffrom con air
, it ws tyhe scene out in the desert when tehy were digging the plane outloud fomr the dirt
. in spawn
, it was the
" living room hell
" conclusion at tyhe end
. in event horizon
, it was tghe video of the event horizon crew being taken over by hell
' s forces
.
and all of face
/ off was pretty dang ogod
. bu as for men in balck
, the only scene i still recall is whn will smith is squishing all thsoe giant roaches
. i remember it not for it
' s humer bu because i am hate roaches with a passion
and was pretty disgusted
.
and yes
, i doed see mimic
, which is something i
' ll touch on iin a later review
. back to men infact balck
( is it just me
, or does that soudn funny
?
) i remember first hearing baout men inwhich black back when i was a comic geek inaddition the 7th grade
and read magazines like wizard
, etc
.
( for those of you who aren
' t comic
- geeks
, wizard is basically to comics whta car adn driver is to cars
, what the new yorker is tothe high society
, what boy
' s life is tothe boy scots
. okay
, that one was pretty pathetic
.
) faw people know thsi
,
but men infront black is based on a very obscure comic book that was
, while not honest
- politician
- rare
, very hard to find
. this wass after the release of tje high
- grossing batman forever
,
and it said that tommy lee jones
and chris o
' donnell weere being considered for the roles
( in the comic book
, there were no black men in black
. kind of weird
, huh
?
) all i can say is
, thank god they didn
' t casted chris o
' donnell
. i know i can
' t be teh only person on tjhe planet who thinks he
' s an annoying
, preppie little snot
.
.
. sorry
. my apologies tothe o
' donnell fans
. i actually had a 7th grade teacher who was a big comic collector
and wass set to buy some of tje comics from him
, anticipating rather craftily tyhat
, if the movei wass a big hit
, it would drive up tghe price of the comics rather nicely
. he decided not tothe sell them to me
, because they were
" innappropriate
"
. hmm
.
.
.
. so now you
' re probably wondering why i
' ve wasted about 5 paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high eyasr
. ogod question
. i
' ll move on to the movei now
. as you propably already know
, will smith
and tommy lee jones
( agents k
and j
, respectively
) belong to a top escret agency known as divison 5
, or it
' s nickname mib
( men in black
.
) men in balck is a reference to the black suits anbd sunglasses the aggenst mear
, anbd tehy
' re mission is tothe investigate reports ofthe alien l
andings adn keep the aliens under controll hwile they
' re here on earth
. not to get too technical or spoil the plot for tje 6 people inspite thge world who haven
' t seen this movei
,
but a basicaly
- big
- roach
- type
- bug l
ands in a redneck farmer
' s yard
, inhabits his body
, annd attempts tothe destroy the entire universe
. nto bad
, eh
?
( i ahve no idea why i jstu typed that
. i
' m nto even raelly paying attention anymore
.
) the special effects are ogod
yet dissapointing infact men infront black
. i foudn their main headquarters to be boring
, as weere the
" cool weapons
" they hadnt
. tyhe noisy cricket just plain sucked
, noone marter what anyone said
. anbd thte movie definitely surprised me inspite tone
, all
though it probaly shoudln
' t have
. it
' s director
, barry sonnenfield
, is known for
" black humor
"
, directing both addams famaly movies
. this movei was basicly a
" balck comedy
"
, nto an action
/ sci
- fi liuke i expected ffrom hte trailers
. don
' t get me wrong onthe waht i think ofthe thsi movie
. it
' s not bad
, i gave it
*
*
*
. it was mostly entertaining throughout it
' s run
,
and had a very ogod ending
,
al
though i think i wass the only person in the theather not amazed by it
. my diagnosis for this picture
: a ogod weekend rental
,
but nto worth a movie ticket
. of course
, the movei is nowe long gone from theaters
,
but that
' s beside tjhe point
. i think
.
