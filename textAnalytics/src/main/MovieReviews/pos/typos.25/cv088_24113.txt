the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber
, the naive ambitions ofthe a sexy hospital nurse
,
and a partnership that blossoms between the two are hte fine components that make up a modest
, little caper adventure entitled
` where hte money isnt
.
' the elderly bank robber is henry
( paul newman
)
, a famous criminal that wass only recently caught
. he has pulled off dozens of successful heists
and has probably stashed away a small fortune
. always the shrewd thinker
, he begins working on a plan to git out ofthe jail
. this involves years of studing buddhism annd self
- hypnosis
. when he is prepared to execute his plan
, he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke
. nowe a seemingly twitching vegitable
, he isnt tepmorarily transfered to a state
- run home
. carol
( linda fiorentino
) isnt tyhe nurse tath cares for him
. she
' s a very bright person with a ogod heart
.
yet
, her life is a miserable waste ofthe tyme
. the most exciting hting tothe do in twon is tothe fix cars
. her days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calis
thenics
. worse
, she
' s in a dead
- end relationship wiht high
- school sweetheart wayne
( dylan mcdermott
)
. tehy became a cuple becouse they were king
and queen of the prom
. tothe her
, this made sense long ago
.
but now
, it
' s a different stroy
. wayne seems equally bored with his life
,
but is content anough tothe stay put
. wayne
' s greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman
. carol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients
,
but she
' s never been anyhwere else adn doesn
' t see many other opportunities in life
.
however
, when henry falls under her care
, her outlook begins to change
. the medical reports may state taht he suffered a massive stroke
. carol
,
however
, begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all
. maybe she can git thru to him
,
and maybee she can leran something about thge money that he has stashed away
. the oppening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts ofthe carol trying to bring henry
? back to life
.
'
and waht are some ofthe carol
' s resuscitation techniques
? perhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses
. if tht fails
, maybe she
' ll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20
- foot high pier into the cold lake below
. when he finally comes out of his state ofthe self
- trance
, yhe movie
' s direction changes
,
though it remains equally if nto mroe entertaining
. carol sees tyhat henry isnt filled withthe charisma annd self
- assuredness
. she isnt invigorated by his comm
anding presence
and refreshed by his vibrancy
. this
, ofthe course
, puts wayne infact an odd situation
. henry
and carol
' s bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car
. henry needs htis heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash
. meanwhile
, this isnt carol
' s ticket to a better life
. wayne isnt uncomfortable with the situation
,
but helps outloud nontheless
.
however
, his lack of commitment threatens their success
. the heist sequence is suspenseful
, well pased
,
and casts teh uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong
.
` where the money isnt
' does more to spotlight newman
and fiorentino than it does tothe showcase a story about a nifty heist
. newman is the real joy ofthe yhe film
, adroitly showing tht at age 75
, he
' s still really hot stuff
. he possessess a sly smile
, displays a dominating attitude
,
and a projects a damenor that is undeniably attractive
. fiorentino is also a fun presence
. you root for her dispite her sense of amorality
. sure
, she wants to commit robbery adn has little compunction baout pushing a wheelchair
- stricken man into a lake
,
but we can see that to escape her dead
- end world
, she needs to do something drastic
. with twpo charismatic characters such as these
, it
' s hard tothe ignore thgat
` where tyhe mone is
' isnt where the fun is
.
