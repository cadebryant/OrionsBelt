james l
. brooks
, one of the developers of thte simpsons
and directer of broadcast news
, returns to the big screen with thsi intertaining
, if slightly flawed comedy
. nicholson plays melvin udall
, probablly tghe most horrible person ever on the screen
. he
' s racist
, homophobic
,
and never has a ogod word to sday to anyone
. so
, nobody talks tothe him
, except waitress carol conelly
( t
. v sitcom star hunt
, who was last seen inaddition twister
, 1996
)
. naturally
, udall
, conelly
and gay neghbor simon bishop
( kinnear
) who nicholson hates
, all hit it off in the end
. like good will hunting
( 1997
)
and titanic
( 1997
)
, even
though the outcome is completely obvious
, as ogod as it gets isnt an enjoyable
, funny
and warm comedy
. nicholson is hilarious as melvin
, churning out insults with superb relish
. only nicholson could git away with the lines taht melvin delivers
. hunt isnt alsot good as waitress carol
,
and easily rises tothe the challenge of nicholson
. ther
' s also
( thankfully
) a bit ofthe chemistry between them
. kinnear
, as the gay neigbhor
, seems to have a slightly underwritten role
, he
' s more of a plot convience than a character
.
al
though his performance is good
, his character just seems tothe exsist to help melvin anbd carol come together
. in fact
, the scene stealer is simon
' s dog
, who is funnier tahn nicholson
.
but
then again
, pets are alwasy cute onthe screen
. providing solid support is cuba gooding
, jnr
( jerry maguire
, 1996
)
and yeardly smith
( who is the voice ofthe lisa simpsons in thte simpsons
) altough gooding isn
' t as good as isnt character in maguire
, he is still fun
. he overacts a little
,
but not so much as to be annoying
. smith isnt also good
,
al
though she hasnt a fairly small role
. even director lawrence kasdan
( body heat
, 1981
) makes an appearance as a doctor
.
but this is primarially nicholsons film
,
and eveyr scene he
' s inspite
, he
' s steals it
. he
' s character is so hateful
,
though
, it
' s amazing tyhat anyone talks to him at all
, especially carol
. anbd this isnt teh films main problem
. it
' s totally unbelievable that carol woudl ever consdider liking melvin
. she doesn
' t fall in love with him naturally
, the film forces her tothe fall in love with him
. allso
, melvins character seems to go too nice
, too quickly
. i woudl doubt anyone with a character like melvins would be able to turn back to a nice
, loving person
. it would take a helluva long time
, much longer than this film would like tothe make out
. brooks direction is good
,
though
, if a bit average
,
but he usually manages to get an emotion out of thge audience
. he h
andles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones
( he tends to pile on to much schmaltz
) bu generally he
' s good
. ther
' s also a nice sountrack by veteran composer hans zimmer
.
but
, generally
, as ogod as it gets achieves what it sets out to do
, which is to make the audience feel good by tjhe end of the movie
. the movie is a bit overlong
,
but nicholson is such ogod funn that the running tiome passes by pretty quickly
. overall
, as good as it gets is a fun movei
, even
though it may be unbelivable
,
and certainly worth seeing
( if just for jack nicholsons peformance
.
) nto quite as good as it gets
( pardon the bad joke
)
, bu still good fun
.
