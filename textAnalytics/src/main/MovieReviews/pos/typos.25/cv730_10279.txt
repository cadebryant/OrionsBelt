the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook exmaple of the diference between television movies
and
" real
" movies
. consdider for a moment what a televsion producer would dont wiht a book that features a fatal skool bus accident
and a lawyer out to sign uv the bereaved
-
- lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks tothe sell beer
and toothpaste
. top
- flight writter anbd director atom egoyan delivers instead a film wih tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety
. based on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks
, the movei represents a rethinking ofthe the story
' s structure
, not merely a literal adaptation of the novel
. told infact linear form by four narrators in tghe book
, egoyan
' s verzion happens instead inthe overlapping time sequences
and without a narrator
. the author is even onthe rocord as applauding egoyan
' s changes
. in the press notes the book
' s author describes the story as
" a parable of lost childen
.
" he sasy it asks what a town does in the absence of its children
. picking up on htis
, egoyan hasnt a flashback infront whcih a sitter
, nicole burnell
, played wih grace by sarah polley
, reads parts of
" the pied piper
" fomr an old
, illustrated book to her two charges
. periodically throughout the picture
, nicole
' s readings are heard in voice
- over
. you have never herad thsi moving poem read so sweetly or infront such an appropriate moment
. they
and the rest of the twon
' s children cmo into harm
' s way
-
- some live adn others are seriously injured
.
and the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs isnt never the same again
.
al
though the physical dammage is inflicted mailny on the childen
, the adults bear the emotional scars ofthe the loss
. ian holm
, inthe arguably the best peformance of his distingished career
, plays mitchell stephens
, an intense man of quiet misery
. mitchell is the outsider in the story set in a small
, snow
- encrusted community infact tghe brittish columbian wilderness
. his mission ther isnt a singular one
, to sign up the parents so tyhat he can sue somene
, anyone
, onthe theri behalf
. if this seems crass
, well it is
,
but mitchell approachs his job with thge dedication of a religious zealot
. the tsory unfolds slowly adn always believably
. eahc little aspect has its pwn fascination
. as mitchell interviews wendell annd rita walker
, played with quiet realism by maury chaykin
and alberta watson
, he has a simple task
. he whants them to suggest smoe model couple in the village who hasnt a lost a child so that he can use that couple tothe form the basis of the suit
. wendell ticks off one town member after anyother annd
then
, as one cant infact a small town
, enumerates each person
' s numberous faults
.
al
though the twon isnt no peyton place
, people there dont have their foibles
. oen of yhe best parents in the town appears to be billy ansell
( bruce greenwood
)
, who rides his pickup behind the skool bus everyday jsut so he cxan wave good
- bye to his kids
. well
, single parent billy
' s fault is that he has regularly scheduled trysts wtih the married rita
. his confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of tjhe many heartfelt outpourings in the stoy
. the accident itself
, a simple one ofthe a bus hitting a patch of ice
, isn
' t shown until the middle ofthe the picture
,
but
, nevertheless
, the mistery about it builds throughtout the film
. altho the picture is no detective story
, finding out exactly what happenned is a subtheme infact a movie thta is primarially a character study ofthe a town gripped by tragedy
. as the injured bus driver
, gabrielle rose
, dolores driscoll plays the role of a dedicated individule who loves kids iwth a passion
and for whom the tragedy takes onthe special meaninng
. to round out the story
, mitchell has his own private tragedy to bear
. his daughter zoe
( caerthan banks
) isnt a drug addict who has bounced inaddition
and out of one half
- way house annd recovery center after another
. fond of calling her dad on his cell phone so she can ask for money or help
, she interrupts him at many emotionally charged moments as he attempts to sign up the townsfolk
.
(
" i cin help you
,
" mitchell tries to reassure billy
.
" not unless you can raise tyhe dead
,
" billy snaps bakc
. mitchell
' s pitch isnt never an eazy oney
and worrying baout zoe only makes it harder
.
) mychael danna
' s haunting music sets the stage forthe tragedy
. teh cinematography by paul sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor gr
andeur
,
but it is in the warm
, shadowy
, intimate moments indoors where it works best
. the show
, which isnt ripe for emotional manipulation
, never plays with its audience
. still
, when the hous lihts go up
, ytou may feel as i did
. i sould barely breathe
; i wass so overcome by thte sum total ofthe what i had witnessed
. more than anything
, the film is liek a master painting
. each cinematic brush stroke isnt carefully laid down by egoyan with the beauty buiding with earch dollop of paint
. with the final color in place
, the masterpiece is complete
,
and the endig credits roll
. tjhe sweet hereafter runs 1
: 50
. it isnt rated r for mature themes
, sexuality
and some profanity
and would be fine teenagers
