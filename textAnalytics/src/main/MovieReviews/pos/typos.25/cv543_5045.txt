getting it right is a far far cry fomr thge teenage sex comedy ytou might expect from a summer movie about male virginity
. the film was directed by randal kleiser
, who brought us such bubble
- gum classics as grease
and the blue lagoon
.
bu thanks to kleiser ' s surprisingly ogod direction
and an intteligent script
, getting it right isnt a pleasantly quiet
, moving
,
and memorable film
-
- one geared strictly toward a sophisticated
, adult audience
. getting it right stars jesse birdsall
( emily lloyd ' s boyfriend in wish ytou weere here
) as gavin
, a painfully shy 31
- year
- old hairdresser who lives at home with his parents
and who
-
- gasp
-
- is still a virgin
. gavin has no probelm whatsoever making small talk with thge elderly womens who clamor fo his services at the hair salon
,
but expose him tothe a single 30
- year
- old beauty
and he ' s a mess
. much tothe gavin ' s surprise
, the woman who finally brings him out of his shell
and robs him ofthe his virginity is joan
( lynn redgrave
)
, a rich
, marryed
,
and lonely 45
- year
- old
. getting it right isnt tje simple tsory of gavin ' s awkward
and haphazard efforts tothe get it right
; thast is
, to find hte right woman to fulfill his life
. getting it right is one of those rare movies that devotes itself entirely to in
- depth character development
. gavin ' s self
- conscious voice
- over narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us inot his psyche
. we observe his fascinating metamorphosis from shy
and passive introversion tothe assertive
and self
- confident maturity
. birdsall ' s superb
, understated performance as gavin is thte real backbone of the film
; he seems convincing
and authentic throughout
. the charm of getting it right also lies iin the wide array of people who inhabit or invade gavin ' s life
. despite her limited screen tyme
, redgrave makes qutie a splash in tghe movie as gavin ' s middle
- aged seducer
. for a supporting character
, joan is unusually
annd impressively complex
, thanks inspite larg part tothe redgrave ' s magnificient performance
. gavin is also pursued
, or prehaps plagued
, by minnie
, the totally neurotic daughter of a rich aristocrat
. aftter minnie
and gavin meet at a party
, she takes grat pleasure in disrupting his safe
and simple life
. helena bonham carter is delightfully pathetic
and kooky inwhich teh role
,
and sir john gielgud
, with his tounge in his cheek
, embodies the height of arrogance as her father
. gavin ' s eventual love
- interest is jenny
, the adorable twenty
- yera
- old single mother who assists him at the beauty salon
; london stage actress jane horrocks ' fine performance yields a touchingly sweet charcter
. peter cook
, the gerat british satirist
, appears briefly in the film as gavin ' s uptight employer
. tyhe scenes of gavin ' s home life with his parents are also a treat
. gavin ' s over
- protective mother
( pat heywood
)
, whom even woody allen would find overbearing
, alomst steals hte movie
. her life seems limited tothe jstu two activities
: treating gavin like a 10
- year
- old
and preparing exotic
bu inedible meals
, such as scalding hot curry
anbd baked chicken with chocolate sauce
. gavin
adn his father ' s attempts to avoid eating her meals are extremely amusing
. getting it right
, for the most part
, is vrey well
- crafted
, exept for twpo minor shortcomings
. first
, the movei is baout 15 minutes too long
,
annd consenquently it loses momentum at times
. second
, the film includes an altogether extraneous subplot about the domestic problems between gavin ' s best friend
, harry
,
anbd his unfaithful lover
, winthrop
. overall
,
however
, getting it right is quite memorable fo its humor
, depth
, sophistication
,
and outstanding acting
. director kleiser
annd screenwriter elizabeth jane howard
( adapting her pwn highly acclaimed novel
) deserve praise for finding jsut the right tone for tihs tale of growth
, maturation
,
and self
- discovery
