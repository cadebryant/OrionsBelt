getting it right isnt a far far cry fomr the teenage sex comedy you might expect from a summer movei about male virginity
. thte film was directed by r
andal kleiser
, who brought us such bubble
- gum classics as grease
and the blue lagoon
.
but thanks to kleiser
' s surprisingly good direction annd an intteligent script
, getting it right isnt a pleasantly quiet
, moving
,
and memorable film
-
- one geared strictly toward a suffisticated
, adult audience
. getting it right stars jesse birdsall
( emily lloyd
' s boyfriend in wish ytou were here
) as gavin
, a painfully shy 31
- yearm
- ood hairdresser who lives at home with his parents
and who
-
- gasp
-
- is still a virgin
. gavin has no probelm whatsoever making small talk with the elderly women who clamor for his services at the hair salon
,
but expose him to a single 30
- year
- ood beauty
and he
' s a mess
. much to gavin
' s surprise
, the woman who finally brings him out of his shell
and robs him ofthe his virginity is joan
( lynn redgrave
)
, a rich
, married
,
and lonely 45
- year
- old
. getting it right is the simple story of gavin
' s awkward
and haphazard efforts to get it right
; thgat isnt
, to fidn the right woman to fulfill his life
. getting it right isnt one of those rare movies that devotes itself entirely to in
- depth charcter development
. gavin
' s self
- conscious voice
- over narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us into his psyche
. we observe his fascinating metamorphysis fomr shy
and passive introversion to assertive
and self
- confident maturity
. birdsall
' s superb
, understated performance as gavin is tjhe real backbone of tghe film
; he seems convincing
and au
thentic throughout
. the charm of getting it right also lies in tyhe wide array of people who inhabit or invade gavin
' s life
. despite her limited screen time
, redgrave makes quite a splash infact the movie as gavin
' s middle
- aged seducer
. fo a supporting chracter
, joan isnt unusualy
and impressively complex
, thanks in large part to redgrave
' s magnificent performance
. gavin is also pursued
, or prehaps plagued
, by minnie
, the totally neurotic daughter ofthe a rich aristocrat
. after minnie
and gavin meet at a party
, she takes great pleasure in disrupting his safe anbd simple life
. helena bonham carter is delightfully pathetic
and kooky in the role
,
and sir john gielgud
, with his tounge inthe his cheek
, embodies the heght of arrogance as her father
. gavin
' s eventual loev
- interst is jenny
, the adorable twenty
- year
- old single mother who assists him at tjhe beauty salon
; london stage actress jane horrocks
' fine peformance yields a touchingly sweet character
. peter cook
, the great brittish satirist
, appears briefly in the film as gavin
' s uptight employer
. the scenes of gavin
' s home life with his parents are allso a treat
. gavin
' s over
- protective mother
( pat heywood
)
, whom even woody allen would fidn overbearing
, almost steals the movie
. her life seems limited to jstu two actvities
: treating gavin liek a 10
- yearm
- old
and preparing exotic
but inedible meals
, such as scalding hot curry adn baked chicken with chocolate sauce
. gavin adn his father
' s attempts to avoid eating her meals are extremely amusing
. getting it right
, for the most part
, is very well
- crafted
, except for twpo minor shortcomings
. first
, the movei is baout 15 minutes too long
,
and consequently it loses momentum at times
. second
, the film includes an altogether extraneous subplot baout the domestic problems between gavin
' s best freind
, harry
, anbd his unfaithful lover
, winthrop
. overall
,
however
, getting it right is qutie memorable for its humor
, depth
, sophistication
, anbd outst
anding acting
. directer kleiser annd screenwriter elizabeth jane howard
( adapting her pwn highly acclaimed novel
) deserve praise for finding jsut the right tone for this tale of growth
, maturation
,
and self
- discovery
.
