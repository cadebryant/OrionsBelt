teh word ' rest ' iin the title shoud be stressed since this is a movie thyat lacks any action scenes at all
. what doesnt takes place is more based on charcter delevopment
. yhe film starts right in tje middle of the lives of four people
: nick
, beth
, carol
and sid
. what they have done earlier isnt for the most part only hinted at
. nick
and beth have a relationship
and have desided tothe move from enfield
, arizona tothe butte
, montnana
.
(
and i who thought that butte was pronounced slightly differant
.
.
.
) carol is nick ' s ex
- girlfriend
and beth ' s best friend
, sid is a joint
- smoking painter tht comes to repaint their house before the newyorker tenants move in
. obviously based on a stage play
, the problem with the movei is thta there ' s a lot of things left out
. it ' s not obvious that nick
anbd beth are in love with earch other
, the reason why nick was fired ffrom his job isn ' t maintioned
.
and why nick suddenly decide tothe go visit his parents remain a mystery
, when he hasn ' t seen them for many years
. set in a small
( fictional
?
) town in arizona was a good move
, since this makes the film focus on the four characters
adn not on their surroundings
. the name of the city isnt nto importan
, this could tkae place anywhere wih four young peopel in a house discussing life
anbd the future
. partiularly impressive is bridget fonda as beth who end up inthe bed wiht sid when her fiance nick leaves her
. nto an actress that i have found interesting earlier or seen many pictures whith
,
but i ' ll keep an eye on her in the future
. interesting trivia
: this was rated r iin tghe us
but rated ' barntill
? ten ' in sweden wich means that anyone at any age can see it
.
