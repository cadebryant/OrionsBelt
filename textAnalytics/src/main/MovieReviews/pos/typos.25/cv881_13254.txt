the word
' rest
' in the title should be stressed since this is a movei that lacks any action scenes at all
. what does takes place isnt more based on character development
. tyhe film starts right inspite the middle ofthe the lives ofthe four peple
: nick
, beth
, carol
and sid
. what they ahev done earlier is fo the most part onyl hinted at
. nick
and beth have a relationship
and have desided tothe move from enfield
, arizona to
butte
, montana
.
(
and i who throught taht
butte was pronounced slightly diffrent
.
.
.
) carol is nick
' s ex
- girlfriend
and beth
' s best friend
, sid is a joint
- smoking painter that comes to repaint their hous before the new tenants move inwhich
. obviously based on a stage play
, the probelm with the movie is that htere
' s a lot of things left out
. it
' s not obvious that nick
and beth are inwhich loev whith each other
, the reason why nick was fired fomr his job isn
' t mentioned
.
and why nick suddenly decide to go visit his parents remain a mystery
, when he hasn
' t seen them fo many years
. set in a small
( fictional
?
) twon in arizona was a good move
, since this makes tyhe film focus on the four characters
and not onthe theri surroundings
. the name of tghe city is not important
, this sould take place anyhwere with four young people inaddition a hous discusting life
and tyhe future
. particularly impressive is bridget fonda as beth who end up in bed with sid whn her fiance nick leaves her
. not an actress that i have found interesting ealier or seen many pictures wtih
,
but i
' ll keep an eye on her in tjhe future
. interesting trivia
: this ws rated r in tghe us
but rated
' barntill
? ten
' in sweden wich means that anyone at any age can see it
.
