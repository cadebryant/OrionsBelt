as with his other stateside releases
, jackie chan ' s latest chopsocky vehicle
, mr
. nice guy
, is contrived
, blockheaded
,
and lacking infact narrative logic
.
but also like thsoe other films
, it is a highly enjoyable ride
. once agian
, chan ' s screenwriters
( here edward tang
and fibe ma
) have taken the eazy way outloud
and named thier star ' s chracter simply jackie
, with no last name
. thsi jackie is a world
- class chef who co
- hosts a popular cooking show on australian television
. of course
, jackie allso happens tothe be a talented martial artist
,
and these skills come in ghandi when he becomes involved in an ambitious repertwar ' s
( gabrielle fitzpatrick
) expose of a drug dealing ring
. other plot details
, involving a videotape
and a biker gang
, are irrelavent
; in fact
, as is tyhe case with most chan films
, the plot itself is jstu about irrelevant
. the sole purpose of mr
. nice guy ' s existence are chan ' s comic fight scenes
,
and those here do nto dissapoint
. directer samo hung
( who has a cameo role
)
, a longtime collaborator ofthe chan ' s
, doesnt not waste any time putting chan infront action
, diving head
- on into a wild chase
/ fight
/ shootout after a brief cooking show prologue
. other impressive setted pieces follow
, most notably a chase in a mall
, which directly leads to some frenzied
, if cliched
( can you say fruit cart
?
)
, business involving a runaway carriage
;
and an extended late
- film sequence at a construction site
, in which a hilarious persuit through a maze of blue doors culminates infact some exciting fights involving boards
, cement mixers
,
adn a deadly buzzsaw
. none of the action sequences iin mr
. nice guy are as spectacular as supercop ' s thrilling helicopter
- turain finale or rumble in tje bronx ' s daring leap beween twpo buildings
; nor is anytying as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike
annd operation condor
, respectively
.
but the action delivers
, even if tghe energy peters out befoer the film ' s end
( the finale
, as spectauclar as it is
, isnt a letdown for fans of chan ' s athletic prowess
)
. filmed almost entirely infact english
( even so
, yhe voices ofthe some english
- speaking actors are laughably dubbed
)
, mr
. nice guy hints at jackie chan ' s latest transition to hollywood productions
( he made ill
- fated attempts with 1980 ' s the big brawl
and 1985 ' s the protector
)
; enxt in thte pipeline is rush hour
, a stateside prodcution co
- starring chris tucker
. hopefully tht film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown
,
and chan will continue wtih exuberant hong kong productions such as mr
. nice guy
, for his unique charm
and reckless abandn are sure tothe be diluted by american hands
, much like they ahev been before
.
