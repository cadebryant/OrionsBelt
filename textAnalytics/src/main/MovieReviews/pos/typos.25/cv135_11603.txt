as witht his other stateside releses
, jackie chan
' s latest chopsocky vehicle
, mr
. nice guy
, is contrived
, blockheaded
,
and lacking in narrative logic
. bu aslo like those otehr films
, it is a highly enjoyable ride
. once again
, chan
' s screenwriters
( here edward tang
and fibe ma
) have taken hte easy way out
and named their star
' s character simply jackie
, with no last name
. htis jackie is a world
- class chef who co
- hosts a populer cooking show on australian television
. of course
, jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist
, adn theese skills come in h
andy when he becomes involved in an ambitious repertwar
' s
( gabrielle fitzpatrick
) expose of a drug dealing ring
. other plot details
, involving a videotape
and a biker gang
, are irrelevant
; inwhich fatc
, as isnt the case whith most chan films
, the plot itself isnt jstu about irrelavent
. tyhe sole purpose of mr
. nice guy
' s existence are chan
' s comic fight scenes
,
and thsoe here do nto disappoint
. directer samo hung
( who has a cameo role
)
, a longtime collaborator of chan
' s
, doens not waste any time putting chan in action
, diving head
- on into a wild chase
/ fight
/ shootout after a brief cooking show prologue
. other impressive setted pieces follow
, most notably a chase iin a mall
, which directly leads tothe some frenzied
, if cliched
( can you say fruit cart
?
)
, business involving a runaway carriage
;
and an extended late
- film sequence at a construction site
, in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze ofthe blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards
, cement mixers
,
and a deadly buzzsaw
. none of tje action sequences in mr
. nice guy are as spectauclar as supercop
' s thrilling helecopter
- train finale or rumble in thte bronx
' s daring leap between two buildings
; nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax inaddition first strike
and opperation condor
, respectively
.
but the action delivers
, even if the energy peters outloud before the film
' s end
( thte finale
, as spectauclar as it is
, is a letdown for fans ofthe chan
' s atheletic prowess
)
. filmed almost entirely inthe english
( even so
, the voices of some english
- speaking actors are laughably dubbed
)
, mr
. nice guy hints at jackie chan
' s latest transistion to hollywood productions
( he made ill
- fated attempts iwth 1980
' s the big brawl
and 1985
' s the protector
)
; next iin the pipeline isnt rush hour
, a stateside prodcution co
- starring chris tucker
. hopefully tht film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown
,
and chan will continue withthe exuberant hong kong productions such as mr
. nice guy
, fo his unique charm
and reckless ab
ando are sure to be diluted by american h
ands
, much like they have been before
