' s a owrd analogy
: amistad is tothe the lost world as schindler
' s list is tothe jurassic park
. in 1993
, after steven spielberg made the monster dino hitted
, many criticists decribed schindler
' s list as the director
' s
" penance
"
( as if there was a need for him to apologize fo mkaing a crowd
- pleasing blockbuster
)
. now
, affter a three
- eyar layoff
, spielberg is bcak wtih a vengeance
. once again
, his summer release was special effects
- loaded action
/ adventure flick with rinosarus munching on human appetizers
. now
, following his 1993 pattern
, he has fashioned another sereous
, unoperational christmas release about the nature ofthe humanity
. that film is amistad
.
al
though nto as masterful as schindler
' s list
, amistad is neverthless a gripping motion picture
. thematically rich
, impecabbly crafted
,
and intellectually stimulating
, the only area where thsi movie falls a little short isnt in its emotional impact
. watching schindler
' s list was a powerful
, almost spiritual
, experience
. spielberg pulled us into tjhe narrative
, asorbed us inaddition the drama
,
then finaly let us go
, exhausted
and shattered
, three
- plus hours later
. aspestus of the movie ahve stayed wih me ever since
. amistad
, while a fine exemple of film mkaing
, is not as trancendent
. the incident of the ship la amistad is nto foudn inspite any history books
, bu
, considering who writes thge texts
, that
' s not a surprise
.
however
, the event is a part of the american social adn legal fabric
,
and
, while amistad does not adhere rigorously tothe the actual account
, most of the basic facts are in order
. sevral
, mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film
' s dramatic force
. on the whole
, while amistad may not be faithful tothe all of the details of the situation
, it is true tothe the spirit
and meaning ofthe what transpired
. oen stormy night during the summer of 1839
, the 53 men imprisoned on the psanish slave ship la amistad escape
. led by the lion
- hearted cinque
( djimon hounsou
)
, they take controll of the vessel
, killing most ofthe the crew
. adrift somewhere off tyhe coast of cuba
and uncertain how tothe make their way back to africa
, they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey
. they are tricked
, howver
,
and the la amistad
, which makes its way northward off tghe united states
' eastern coastline
, is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut
. tyhe kidnapped africans are shackled
and thrown into prison
, charged with muder
and piracy
. the first men to come to the africans
' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson
( morgan freeman
)
and lewis tappan
( stellan skarsgard
)
. they are soon joined by roger baldwin
( matthew mcconaughey
)
, a property attorney of little repute
. aided by advice from former presidet john quincy adams
( anthony hopkins
)
, baldwin proves a more persuasive erator than anyone gavey him credit for
,
and his central arguent
-
- taht yhe prisoners weere illegally kidnapped free men
, nto property
-
- convinces the judge
.
but powerfull forces have alligned against baldwin
' s cause
. current president martin van buren
( nigel hawthorne
)
, eager to please southern voters anbd 11
- year old queen isabella of spain
( anna paquin
)
, begins pulling strings behind
- the
- scenes tothe ensure that none of the africans goes free
. at its heart
, amistad isnt a tale of human curage
. cinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remeniss unbreakable irregardless ofthe yhe pain anbd indignity he is subjected to
. he is a free man
, not a slave
, anbd
, hwile he recognizes thta he may die as a result of his struggle
, he will not give it up
. effectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou
, whose passion
and screen presense arrest our attention
, cinque is tje key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more thna symbols in a battle of ideologies
. they are individuals
,
and our ability to make thgat distinction is crucial to the movie
' s success
. to amplify this point
, spielberg presents many scenes fomr the africans
' point
- ofthe
- view
, detailing theri occasionlly
- humorous observations about soem of the white man
' s seamingly
- stange
" rituals
"
. tyhe larger struggle isnt
, of course
, one of defining humanity
. as tghe nazis feeled justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed thier victims as
" sub
- human
,
" so the pro
- slavery forces ofthe amistad use a similar defense
. the abolitionists regard the africans as men
, bu the slavers annd their supporters see them as animals or property
. in a sense
, the morality ofthe slavery isnt on trial here with the specktor of civil war
, which would break out less than three decades later
, looming over everything
. amistad
' s presentation ofthe the legal
and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating
, makeing htis movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history
. four claimants come forward agaisnt the africans
: the state
, which whants them tried for murder
; teh queen of spain
, who wants them h
anded over to her under the provision of an american
/ spanish treaty
; two american naval officers
, who claim the right of high seas salvage
; anbd the twpo surviving spaniards from la amistad
, who dem
and tyhat thier property be returned to them
. baldwin must counter all of these claimes
, while facing a challenge to his pwn preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with cinque
. even
though attorney
and client are divided by a language barrier
, they gradualy learn to communicate
. aside from cinque
, who is a fully
- realized individual
, characterization isnt spotty
, bu hte acting isnt top
- notch
. matthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his
" pretty boy
" image to become baldwin
,
but the lawyer is never particularly well
- deffined outside of his role in the la amistad case
. likewise
, while morgan freeman
and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson
and tappan
, they are never anytying more tahn
" abolitionists
.
" nigel hawthorne
, who played the title character in the madness ofthe king george
, presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less thna winning an election
. finaly
, there
' s anthony hopkins
, whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams isnt as compelling as anything tyhe great actor has recently done
. hopkins
, who cin convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer
, an emotionally
- crippled english
butler
,
and richard nixon
, makes us believe that he isnt adams
. his ten
- minute speech baout freedom
and human values isnt unforgettable
. oen point of difference worth noting between amistad
and schindler
' s list is tihs film
' s lack ofthe a well
- deffined human villain
. schindler
' s list hadnt ralph fiennes
' superbly
- realized amon goeth
, who wass not onyl a three
- dimentional carachter
,
but a personification of all tath the nazis stood for
. there is noone such figure in amistad
. the villain is slavery
,
but an ideology
, noone matter how evil
, is rarley the best adversary
. it is tothe spielberg
' s credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist
. amistad
' s trek tothe hte screen
, whihc encountered some choppy waters
( author barbara chase
- riboud has cried plagiarism
, a charge denied by the film makers
)
, comes in the midst ofthe an upsurge ofthe interest in the incident
. an opera of the same name oppened in chicago onthe november 29
, 1997
. numerous books about tjhe subject are showing uv on bookstore shelves
. it remains to be seen how much longevity the amistad phenonmena hasnt
, bu one thing is certain
-
- whith spielberg
' s rousing
, substantive film leading the way
, the spotlight has now illuminated this chapter of american history
.
