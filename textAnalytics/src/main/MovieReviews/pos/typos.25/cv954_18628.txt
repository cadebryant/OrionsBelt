andful of hits inwhich tghe past few years
. with tghe exception of the dreadful holy man
, he appears to be onthe pace for a full
- fledged comeback
. life was a great move on the part of murphy
and co
- star martin lawrence
, becouse it
' s a great showcase for both actors thast never resorts to slap
- sticky drivel
. director ted demme is smart enough tothe realize that the two comedians can ganerate enough genuine laughs on their own
,
and doesn
' t insert a distracting plot to back them up
. life is
, infact a sense
, one great balancing ect with murphy onthe one end
and lawrence on the other
. amazingly
, teh scale never tips in either
' s favor due to the marvelous chemistry anbd wonderful contrast taht eahc actor allows the otehr
. as the movie opens
, we
' re introduced tothe ray gibson
( eddie murphy
)

andles the makeup effects of the two actors inwhich a fantastic
, academy award calibur manner
. nto only do we believe the characters look as if they
' re 90 years ood
,
but they sound like it
, too
. murphy
and lawrence are completely convincing in the lead roles
, even as crotchety old cons bickering over a game of cards
. htis is just one ofthe the pleasant surprises tyhat the film has tucked uv it
' s sleeve
. hwile the ads are marketting life as a straight arrow comedy
, there is a hefty amount of dramatic material hidden at it
' s core
.
but the commedic aspects work wonderfully
, wisely drawing strength from the talents of the twpo stars
. the movei is more of a comedy tahn it is a drama
,
but in both senses
, it
' s an overwhelming delight
. i could say a few bad things about the movie
,
but i don
' t want to
. it
' s such a nice surprise
, such a great veicle fo eddie murphy
and martin lawrence
, that it warrants a huge smile as the credits begin to roll
