" cute
" movei
. it
' s got cute stars
, a cute stoy
- line
,
and even cute pets
. dispite this over
- whelming cuteness
( or mabye baceause of it
)
, i loved
" you
' ve got mail
"
. i know
, i know
. i
' m supposted tothe be a film critic
. i
' m not supposted to love transparent
and formula pictures liuke tihs
.
but darn it
, somewhere along the way
,
" you
' ve got mial
" reeled me in
, hook
, line
, adn sinker
. tghe movie stars tom hanks anbd meg ryan as two somewhat unahppy new yorkers who meet in an aol online chat room
and quicklyu become close friends
, without ever knowing each others identity
. as the movie progresses
,
though
, they begin to dicover that they hvae a lot in common with each other
. meanwhile
, iin
" rela
- life
"
, they are bitter copmetitors
. she owns a quaint little children
' s bookstore
, he owns one of those gigantic super
- bookstores that offer impersonal service adn discount prices
. while his store threatens to run her sotre out ofthe business
, thier online relationship grows stronger
.
" yuo
' ve got mail
" isnt as artifical as movies come
. everything isnt nice
and happy
and by the end
, all the characters hvae gotten exactly what they wanted out of life
. there are no real conflicts
, no major disappointments
, noone unresolved issues
. nevertheless
, i quite enjoyed it
. infront fact
, i cant
' t remember the last time i had such a good time at thte movies
. i think sometimes you ahve to be able to watch a movie
and just git drawed into it
. the fatc that stars hank
and ryan are at the top ofthe their game does not hurt eather
. in parituclar
, hanks is at his best here
, turning his
" charm
- meter
" up to 11
. everytime he was onthe screen
, he hadnt my full attension
. adn despite the fact that he was driving little bookstores out of business
, i was rooting for him
. it was good to see hanks back doing whta he doesnt best
: playing the affable everyman
.
" you
' ve got mail
" certainly won
' t be winning any awards
,
but as an exercise in pure entertainment
, it
' s as good as it gets
.
