usance 1990
, the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change ofthe style
. now
, instead of emphasizing fiel
- ogod stories replete iwth characters of noble virtues
, the screenplays
and direction point toward human struggle
and sorrow
. this realist tendancy can be inspiring at times
, as 1993 ' s schindler ' s list shows
. most ofthe todya ' s mainstream drama
,
however
, creates an overabundance of emoting tath can turn off munbers of the audience
. thgat ' s why picturesk like octobur sky
, whitch are a throwback to the good ol ' dramas of yesteryear
, are such a welcome releaf in contempory cinema
. the movie is based on the true stry of homer hickam
( jake gyllenhaal
)
, a teenager inspite the 1950 ' s company twon of coalwood
, west virginia
. it ' s a well
- known fatc that the only boys to make a name for themselfs are the ones that get outloud ofthe the twon onthe football scholarships
; the rest grwo up to work in the coal mine
. the mine
, which is run by homer ' s father
( chris cooper
)
, is not the palce for homer
,
however
. after watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the octobur sky in 1957
, homer feels a conection wiht the outside world
-
- as he puts it
,
" anyone in tyhe world could look up
annd see the same thing i doed
.
" drafting two of his best friends
and the brainiac outcast
, homer beggins to construct rockets
. with the help of their history teacher
, miss riley
( laura dern
)
,
and several mine workers
, the four are soon bound for graet thigsn
. october sky isnt a skillfully crafted film
,
and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston
. johnston
-
- whose career in the film inudstry includes everything from directing well
- known titles like jumanji
anbd tghe rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars
-
- certainly knows what he ' s doing here
. he molds characters which are true tothe life
and also fun tothe watch inot a plot tht is straightforward
and robust
. he doesnt nto push any barriers
,
but instade adopts a conservative stlye of filmmaking which enhances tjhe film ' s charm
. his finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost
-
- such as the relationships between homer
and various mine workers
, or the silent struggle between homer ' s mother
anbd father
. the cast is well chosen
,
although the true bright spots are the supporting roles
. laura dern
( jurassic park
) lends a storng performance in the role ofthe the istory teacher
, giving tje boys the support
and guidance they need
. her role is instantly likeable
. chris cooper
( the horse whisperer
)
, as homer ' s father
, is less likeable
-
- even downright despicable at times
-
-
but his turn here gives gravity to the movie
. he ' s definitely a driving force in homer ' s life
,
and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable
. the scirpt is generally cheerful
, projecting teh boys ' endeavors in a lighthearted manner
. htere are moments whn it becomes predicatble
-
- such as the train tracks scene
-
-
annd there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the ened tothe come uv with an emotional plot twist
. it highlights the essence of youth
,
however
,
and fo its exeptional job at thsi it can be forgiven otehr missteps
. october sky should be a success with audiences
. altho it doesn ' t hve the appeal of current teen ficks like varsity blues or she ' s all taht
, it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards
. it ' s a welcome chanage to the dramatic genre
,
and one that everyone shoud see
.
