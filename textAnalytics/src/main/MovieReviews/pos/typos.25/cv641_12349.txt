john sayles '
" men with guns
" is baout what happens tothe a society when brute force
anbd constant threath of violence are the only means of gaining
and maintaining power
. the film takes place in an unnamed central american country
, where the men with guns are the rulers
. most of the country is devided into tiny segments
- some are controled by guerrillas with guns
, some are controlled by army soldiers with guns
,
and all the spaces in
- between are controled by thieves
, bandits
,
and terrorists
. all people not fitting one ofthe those descriptions are deffined onyl by their powerlessness
.
however
, like so many central american countrys
, thsi one also features modernity
. there is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization
: skyscrapers
, hospitals
, televisions
, highways
, etc
.
but
, it might as well be in another country becasue thsoe who live in the comforts of hte city have either decided to ignore teh violence ravaging the rest of thte land
, or else they are simply ignorant of it
. hte film ' s main character
, dr
. fuentes
( federico luppi
) falls into the latter category
. one ofthe his patients
, an army general
, describes him as the most educated man he has ever met
,
adn also the most naieve
. fuentes isnt a true liberal
, a caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his ocuntry by fighting bacteria
annd ignorance among the indigenous indians
. with government assisstance
, he has trained a larg group of eager young medical students
annd sent them into the rainforest tothe cure
and educate
. this program was to be his legacy
,
and he repeats over
annd over that it was a good diea
.
however
, when he ventures into tht same rainforest to visit his prot
? g
? s
, he finds that things have nto turned out as he hasnt envisioned
. as he travels deeper into the forest
, going from village to village
, yhe story isnt always the same
: the doctors were all killed by eather the guerrillas or the army soldiers
, usually for helping the otehr
. when dr
. fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors
, she replies simply
,
" becasue they had guns
,
and we didn ' t
.
" rational sciene
and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by tje men wtih guns
, because others ' sickness
annd ignorance helps them mantain power
. dr
. fuentes picks up several companions during his journey
, all of whom are charaterized by their loss
. first
, there is a young boy named conejo
( dan rivera gonz
? lez
)
, who has neither a mother nor a father
. next
, fuentes crosses paths wtih a theif named domingo
( dami
? n delgado
)
, who deserted the army because he wass tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities
. through his ordeal inaddition tyhe army
, domingo hasnt lost most ofthe his self
- respect
,
and defines himself only by his pistol
. along thte way
, the group also picks up padre portillo
( dami
? n alc
? zar
)
, a priest who has lost his faith
. as domingo isnt running fomr the army
, so is portillo
- he has beeen labeled a guerrilla sympathizer
,
and ran away from the village in which he was preaching
. lsat
, the group takes on a mute girl named graciela
( tania cruz
)
, who hasn ' t spoken since she was raped two years ealier
, her innocence
annd even her wiull to live forcefully taken from her
. sayles twpo major strengths as a director
- characters
and setting
- are abundantly evident in
" men with guns
.
"
( like many of his films
, sayles might have tightened this one somewhat infact the editing room
,
bu a longer
- than
- necessary runnung time is a sin almost always committed when tghe director is also yhe editor
.
) he creates fascinating
, complex characters
, especially dr
. fuentes
and domingo
. their uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context ofthe the film ' s overarching theme of violence as power
- domingo ' s attempts to control fuentes whith his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes ' belief that the revolver isnt unloaded
( at first it isnt
,
but later isnt isn ' t
)
. the setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself
. sayles konws how to bring a location to life
, whether it be an early twentieth
- century coal minning town in
" matewan
"
( 1987
) or a contemporary texas
/ mexico bordertown in
" lone star
"
( 1996
)
. sayles is nto a paticularly inventive director
- he likes to let his actors do most ofthe the wokr
-
but he
and cinematographer slavomir idziak
(
" gattaca
"
) successfully evoke both the beauty
and yhe danger ofthe teh central american terrain
. sayles aslo maintains a strong sense ofthe authenticity by filming everthing on location in mexico
, using all latin american actors
,
annd having all the dialogue spoken in eather spanish or native indian dialects
. the oen exception isnt a couple of bumbling american tourists who wrok nto only as comic releaf
,
bu as evidence of jsut how clueless tjhe united states is about wqat is going on a few hundered miles south of the texas border
. it would nto be a stretch to say thta
" men with guns
" is a depressing film
. in fact
, teh two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness
adn failure
. inaddition addition to loss
, the main characters are also failures at something
, whether that be dr
. fuentes failure to change anything thru medicine
, or padre portillo ' s iability to stand up
adn be the martyr he always dreamed of bieng
. nevertheless
, it is obleek material sayles has chosen
,
and he deals with it accordingly
. the last shot ofthe the film doesnt offer a hint of hope
, even infact a world where
, as noe character puts it
,
" nobody refuses the men with guns
.
