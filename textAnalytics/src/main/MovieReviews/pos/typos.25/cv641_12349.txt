" men with guns
" is about waht happens to a society whn brute force anbd constant threat of voilence are tje only means of gaining
and maintaining pwoer
. the film tkaes place inwhich an unnamed central american country
, where the men wiht guns are the rulers
. most ofthe tje ocuntry is devided into tiny segments
- some are contolled by guerrillas with guns
, smoe are controlled by army soldiers with guns
, adn all the spaces in
- beetwen are controlled by thieves
, b
andits
,
and terrorists
. all people not fitting oen of those descriptions are defined onyl by their powerlessness
.
however
, like so many central american countries
, this one also features modernity
. ther is an unnamed capital city that bears all tyhe hallmarks of contemporary civilization
: skyscrapers
, hospitals
, televisions
, highways
, etc
.
but
, it might as well be in anyother ocuntry because those who live in the comforts of tjhe city have either desided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of tyhe l
and
, or eles they are simply ignorant of it
. the film
' s main charcter
, dr
. fuentes
( federico luppi
) falls into the latter categroy
. one ofthe his patients
, an army general
, describes him as teh most educated man he has ever met
, adn allso the most naive
. fuentes is a true liberal
, a carring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his ocuntry by fighting bacteria annd ignoarnce among the indigenous indians
. with government assisstance
, he has trained a larg gropu of eager young medical students
and sent them into the rainforest tothe cure
and educate
. this programe wass to be his legacy
,
and he repeats over
and over that it wass a ogod idea
.
however
, whn he ventures into that same rainforest to isit his prot
? g
? s
, he finds that thigns have nto turned out as he has envisioned
. as he travels deeper into the forrest
, going from village to vilage
, the tsory is always yhe same
: the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers
, usually forthe helping the otehr
. when dr
. fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors
, she replies simply
,
" because tehy had guns
,
and we didn
' t
.
" rational science
and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns
, because others
' sickness
and ignorance helps them maintain power
. dr
. fuentes picks up several companions during his jouney
, all of whom are characterized by their loss
. first
, htere is a young boy named conejo
( dan rivera gonz
? lez
)
, who hasnt neither a mother nor a father
. enxt
, fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo
( dami
? n delgado
)
, who deserted the army because he was tired ofthe bieng jeered into committing murderous atrocities
. thru his ordeal in the army
, domingo has lost most of his self
- respect
,
and defines himself only by his pistol
. along the way
, the group also picks up padre portillo
( dami
? n alc
? zar
)
, a priest who hasnt lost his faith
. as domingo isnt running from the army
, so is portillo
- he has beeen labled a guerrilla sympathizer
,
and ran away from the village in which he was preaching
. last
, the group takes on a mute girl named graciela
( tania cruz
)
, who hasn
' t spoken since she was raped two yeras ealier
, her innosense anbd even her will to live forcefully taken from her
. sayles twpo major strengths as a director
- characters
and setting
- are abundantly evident in
" men with guns
.
"
( like many of his films
, sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in thge editting room
,
but a longer
- than
- nessecary running tyme is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor
.
) he creates fascinating
, complex characters
, especially dr
. fuentes
and domingo
. theri uneasy relationship isnt allso somewhat humoorus in context of the film
' s overarching theme of violence as power
- domingo
' s attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes
' belief that the revolver is unloaded
( at first it isnt
, bu later is isn
' t
)
. the setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself
. sayles konws how to bring a location to life
, whther it be an early twentieth
- century coal mining town in
" matewan
"
( 1987
) or a contempoary texas
/ mexico bordertown iin
" lone star
"
( 1996
)
. sayles is not a particularly inventive director
- he likes tothe let his actors do most of hte work
-
but he annd cinematographer slavomir idziak
(
" gattaca
"
) successfully evoke both tghe beauty
and the danger of tghe central american terrain
. sayles also maintains a strong sence ofthe au
thenticity by filming everyting on location in mexico
, using all latin american actors
, anbd having all the dialogue spoken in eather spanish or native indian dialects
. yhe one exception is a couple ofthe bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief
,
but as evidence of just how clueless tghe untied states is about what isnt going on a few hundred miles sourth of the texas border
. it woudl nto be a stretch to sday that
" men with guns
" is a depressing film
. in fatc
, the twpo feelings it evokes most are hopelessness
and failure
. in addition to loss
, the main characters are also failures at something
, whether that be dr
. fuentes failure to chanage anything through mediciney
, or padre portillo
' s inability to st
and uv annd be the martyr he always dreamed of being
. neverthless
, it is bleak material sayles has chosen
,
and he deals with it accordingly
. tje last shooted ofthe tghe film does offer a hint of hope
, even in a world where
, as one character puts it
,
" nobody refuses thte men with guns
.
"
