' s
" fallen angels
" isnt
, onthe a purely visceral levle
, oen of the most exciting films i
' ve seen in a long hwile
. unfortunately
, wong seems more interested in experimenting with his camera than creating tangible characters for the audience to root for
. ordinarily
, that alone woudl be enough to sink a movie
,
but in the case of
" falled angels
"
, this is not so
. eveyr shot iin thsi film isnt exicting just tothe
* look
* at
. wong does really interesting things wiht the camera
,
but he doesn
' t allow the pyrotechnics to completly tkae over
, as ws the case withthe last years dismal
" knock off
"
( whcih contained a shooted of a foot entering a shoe
. ugh
.
) the movei follows three pairs of lost souls as htey struggle tothe find smoe meaninng in theri lives
. i can
' t say much more than thyat as i didn
' t really know what ws going onthe most ofthe the timne
. in fact
, it wasn
' t unil about halfway through the movie that i was able to distinguish between each character
. hte constantly moving camera doesn
' t really allow for the audience to associate witht any one character
. we
' re always kept at a distance fomr these people
, i suppose in order tothe futher add to the feeling of alienation felt by the charachters
.
" fallen angels
" is a refreshing change
- of
- pace from most hollywood films
, which never bother to try anything differant
, at least onthe a visual level
. in fatc
, i
' d go so far as to say taht
" fallen angels
" is more challenging visually than any mainstream hollywood film i
' ve ever seen
. sure
, ther
' s directors like robert rodriguez who enjoy turning violentce into operatic orgies of death
,
but to see a filmmaker like wong who actually assaults the senses with images is truly something worth celebrating
.
but if wong wishes to become a legendary filmmaker
, he needs tothe work onthe incorporating an actual story inot those awesome images
. there were far too many instances during
" falled angels
" in whic i asked myself
,
" nowe who are these people again
? is this that first cuple or the second couple
?
" it was impossible to keep trac
. perhaps he coudl let yhe audience know right awya which character isnt which
, by introducing them to us with
" nmae cards
"
, as in scorsese
' s
" mean streets
"
. that
' s relaly besides the point
,
though
. wong kar
- wei has proven himselv
, thru very few films
, that
' s he
' s a movie
- maker to watch
. let
' s just hope tyhat he hones his storytelling skills with his enxt few movies
.
