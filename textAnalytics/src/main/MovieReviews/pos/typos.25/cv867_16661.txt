wong kar
- wei ' s
" falled angels
" isnt
, on a purely visceral level
, one of the most exciting films i ' ve seen in a long while
. unfortunately
, wong seems more interseted in experimenting wiht his camera than creating tangible characters for the audience to root for
. ordinarily
, that alone owudl be enough to sink a movie
,
but in the case of
" falled angels
"
, this is not so
. eveyr shooted in this film is exciting just to
* look
* at
. wong does really intresting things with the camera
,
but he doesn ' t allow the pyrotechnics to completely tkae over
, as ws the case with last years dismal
" knock off
"
( which contained a shot of a foot entering a shoe
. ugh
.
) the movie follows three pairs of lost souls as they struggle tothe fidn some meaning in their lives
. i can ' t say much more than that as i didn ' t really know what was going onthe most ofthe the tiome
. in fact
, it wasn ' t until about halfway thru the movie taht i was able to distinguish between each character
. the constanly moving camera doesn ' t really allow for the audience to associate with any one character
. we ' re always kept at a distance fomr these peple
, i supose in order to further add to the feeling of alienation felt by the characters
.
" fallen angels
" is a refreshing change
- of
- pace from most hollywood films
, which never bother to try anything different
, at least on a visual level
. in fact
, i ' d go so far as to say that
" falled angels
" is more challenging visually than any mainstream hollywood film i ' ve ever seen
. sure
, there ' s directors like robert rodriguez who enjoy turning violence into operatic orgies of death
,
but to see a filmmaker like wong who actually assaults the senses with images is truly something worth celebrating
.
bu if wong wishes to become a legendary filmmaker
, he needs to work on incorporating an actual stroy into thsoe awsome images
. there weere far too many instances during
" fallen angels
" inthe which i asked myself
,
" now who are these peopel again
? is thsi that first couple or teh second cuple
?
" it was impossible to keep track
. perhaps he could let tje audience know right awya which character isnt which
, by introducing them to us with
" nmae cards
"
, as in scorsese ' s
" mean streets
"
. that ' s really besides thte point
,
though
. wong kar
- wei has proven himself
, through veyr faw films
, that ' s he ' s a movie
- maker to watch
. let ' s jstu hope thta he hones his storytelling skills with his enxt few movies
