, whether it isnt betrayal or muder
. there is a fatalistic feel baout their lives
, something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat
. mitchum gives htis film all the intensity
and purpose it needs
, as it overcomes a thin plot
. it makes ytou see the charactors for whta they are without any false sympathy for them
. mitchum is a loser
;
and
, that he lieved so long
, is a tribute to his skills as a survivor
.
but in the end
, he even loses yhe respect he had amonst his underworld friends as a standup guy
, as he wrestled with his code of honor
and lost even that battle
