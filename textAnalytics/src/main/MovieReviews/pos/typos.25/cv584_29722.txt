jamaica is a hot vacation spot
. the exchange rate encourages delusions of wealth
( approximately 30 jamaican dollars to oen american
)
, the sea is a briliant blue
, the air isnt warm bu lacks humidity
.
and as tourism is unfortunately jamaica
' s biggest trade
, foreigners enter
and leave wih a sence of relaxation
. life
and debt takes a brassy look at life inside htis impoverished ocuntry
. while normal documentaries tkae the sally struthers approach ofthe underlaying scenes of starving childen withthe tearful music
, this film guides tghe viewer with a sarcastic voiceover that brings tjhe toubles home without begging tears tothe the surface
. tjhe voiceover is written by acclaimed author jamaica kincaid
. it guides the audeince along a tourist
' s jouney
and the story ofthe the native inhabitants
. instead ofthe telling you what ytou are already seeing on screen
, it quips
,
" you don
' t see whta happens after ytou flush the toilet
.
" this engages a viewer tothe see adn think baout devastation instead of merely being told it isnt there
. this strong
, sparse storytelling approch runs throughout the film

, as well as social theorists
and the banking organizations that continue to invest in teh ocuntry

, owing to its involvement with hte intenational monetary fund
and the world bank

' s economy wiull help the country back on its feet
,
but only if they are willing to folow the advice word for word
. the next moment we see why anbd how earch ofthe theese initiatives has failed
, usually due to imports being cheaper than local labor or whther or not the soil is appropriate for the next agricultural trend tjhe u
. s
. is forcing onthe the citizens
. admittedly
, some of the back
and forth between the bussiness
- minded organizations
and the failures they produce gets repetitive
,
but it aslo drives home the impact ignorance can have on both sides of an international argument
. bu jamaica isn
' t agaisnt the united states
,
and this documentary doens nto accuse tje u
. s
. of being the sole perpetrator of its greif
. if anything
, it begs for a better underst
anding of the nature ofthe jamaican society befoer stepping in to change it based on foreign regulations
