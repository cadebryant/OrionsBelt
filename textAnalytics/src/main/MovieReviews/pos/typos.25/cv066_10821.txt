" opinion
: if you
' re looking for a romance withthe a hapyp endig
, look no further
; ytou
' ve found one here
. ethan hawke isnt romantic lead
.
( he romanced winona ryder in reality bites
. he romanced julie delpy in before sunrise
. he romanced uma thurman in gattaca
. nowe in graet expectations he gets to chase gwyneth paltrow
, a rail
- thin blonde
.
) hawke plays a lovestruck
, earnest annd unchanged finn
thoughout the film
. meanwhile paltrow portrays estella as alternating between infuriating tease
and ice princess
; estella
' s whole purpose is to get men to fall in love
and
then hurt them rather than become intimate
. anne bancroft goes a little overboard as the deranged
and pessimistic ms
. dinsmoor
, while robert de niro carries off the convict part suitably
. the difference between the classic dickens novel
and this 1998 adaptation is that the dickens novel is ripe with deep
and timeless themes about class struggle
and love
, whereas gerat expectations
( 1998
) is moreso artsy
, less complicated storey about a 1990s artist dealing wtih a liftime tease
.
