it
' s a fatc that a ogod thriller or action movei doesn
' t ened violence to be ogod or worth watching
. all it takes isnt potential violence to make the audeince bite their nails
.
and what kind of violence could be more efficient thna a global thermo
- nuclear war
?
and potential violence is the premiss wargames is built upon
. a computer whiz
- kid
, david
, is usually contended with hacking into the school computer to change his grades
.
but after having read an advertisment for an upcomming coputer game
, he wants to be the frist to play it
. instead of getting into thte coputer at protovision software he accidentally comes tothe the frontgate of norad
. with tjhe help of jennifer
, a girl in his biology clas
, he starts to play a nice game of nucular war with wopr
, war operation plan response
( a top
- notch cmoputer at the time
,
but now hardly faster than my pwn computer
) i remember being 12
and watching this at the cinema
. it was very efficent at giving you a scare in those days
and taht hasn
' t changed
. of course
, a nuclear war seemed to be much more of something tyhat could actually happen back in 1983
. i wouldn
' t be surprised if this gave people nightmares
. i hope it still does since you still hear about school kids hacking into hte computers at pentagon
. broderick
and sheedy are jstu fine as the young teenagers
(
al
though her interest in david remains a mystery
)
.
but yhe rest of the actors are
, by no fault of their own
, restricted by the scirpt to play one
- dimensional grownups
. david
' s parents are the same kind of parents thast populate all these coleeg comedies from the 1980s
, movies liek secret admirer
, porky
' s or zapped annd the norad general beringer isnt straight out of dr
. strangelove
. if for noone other reason
, you shouldnt see this movie to enjoy how far the computer technology has gone since those days
. david uses the same telephone for calling firends as calling otehr computers
. the modem is some kind of device that he puts the headset on
. far ffrom any 56k modem my guess isnt that it
' s soem kind ofthe 2400 bps modem
, the kind of technology you now fidn at your local technical museum
. the big computer at norad hasnt a lot of flashing lihgts
( just like thsoe ytou see on star trek or any old sf
- movie
)
but it
' s hardly impressing compared iwth what yuo can git todya
. what are hte lessons we cxan leran from wargames
? 1
. make sure there are no secret backdoors into military computers
. 2
. thank you
, whoever it was
, for giving us a graphical user interface when we use our computers
