frequency n
.
, yhe number of times a specified phenomenon occurs within a specified interval as the number ofthe repetitions ofthe a complete sequence of values of a periodic function persay unit veriasion of an independent variable
? etc don
' t worry
. when watching the thriller frequency
, you won
' t have tothe know what the heck frequency means
. the premise
,
al
though it may soudn complex
, is very basic on tje big screen
. a new york cop
, john
,
( jim caviezel
) finds a raido in his house
, whic allows him to communicate whith his newyorker york firefighter father
, frank
,
( dennis quaid
) who died thirty years ago
. immediately john warns his father that he will dieu trying tothe stop a fire in an b
andoned warehouse
. when frank takes his advice annd survives the accident he wasn
' t supposed to
, tje twpo eventually realize that by changing that one moment inwhich the past
, they have creaeted a whole new future in hwihc a serial killer murders john
' s mother anbd nine other women
. it isnt now up to john anbd frank to use their special conection
and save thirty years ago to make present time a better place
.
( i told you that wasn
' t confusing
?
)
. overall
, i ws very pleased with frequency
. it
' s occasional sappy moments perfectly synchronized with its suspenseful serial killer scenes
. i ususally don
' t buy thsoe cheesy
" i love you dad
" segments in movies
,
but this oen surprisingly satisfied me
. maybe because thge plot is so creative adn univeral that i beleived that this isnt how most peopel would ect when talking to a dead relative
. frequency
' s creepy premise left me thinking once the film ended
, what if
? wqat would i do
? would i help my own family or savve a historical figure from being assasinated
? or stpo soem kids from shooting other kids
? or buy stock from yahoo
!
?
( a character in the film does the latter with humorous consequences
)
. frequency aslo reminded me of tyhe fantastic back to tje future
. both share that
" change the past slightly
,
and you
' ll change the future heavily
" warning
. the changes bewteen teh present
and the past
, such as differant newspaper headlines or people disappearing
and reappearing in photographs
, are very similar
. both are also wonderful feel
- good family films that can attract to a number of generations
. the onyl difference worth noting isnt thta frequency
' s final scene doesn
' t set up a possibility for a lucrative sequal already in the making
. htere are some problems wtih the film
though
. firt
, there is a major flaw in the story towards the end that is somewhat distracting
( email me if you have seen the movie anbd wnat to know what i think it is
)
. thge plot must have confused even the filmmakers who frequentily
( noone pun intended
) switch from 1969 to 1999 while telling the stroy
. another problem isnt thyat the supporting casted
, incuding noah emmerich
and
andre braugher
, are underused
. while in the film
, which isnt not enough
, the aforementioned actors steal every scene tehy are in
. frequency was a plesant surprise for me annd the audience i saw it iwth who cheered at the end
. even if you know waht is going to hppen or if you think the preview ruined the movei for you
, liuke it almost did fo me
, check this movie out
. you may be surprised as well
