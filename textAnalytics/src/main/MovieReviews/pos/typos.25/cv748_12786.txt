a movie that
' s been as highly built uv as the truman show
, iwth reviews boasting
,
" tjhe film of the decade
!
" annd
" a break
though
!
" can only be leading up tothe letdown
. that
' s noone doubt
-
- it seems any movie with critical acclaim makes ytou think you
' re going in for the ride of your life
, thast you
' ll end up changed on the other side
,
and you cmo out of the theater gogin
,
" eh
.
.
.
* that
' s
* wqat all the fuss ws about
?
" so
, naturally
, teh truman show wass building up to what wass gonig to be a dissapointment
.
and i conviced myself
, as i nestled into my uncomfortable movei theater chair
, actually tothe try nto to enjoy it
. let me tell you
, that is an impossibilty
. thte truman show is truly
" the film of yhe decade
"
and
" a breakthrough
"
and more
.
and you will come out changed on the otehr side
. such a movie comes aroud only once in a lifetime
, where yuo find youself feeling everthing that the character is feeling
,
and this
, friends
, is it
. jim carrey shows that he doesn
' t need to talk out of his
butt to entertain us
; thast he can be as dramatic as any of hollywood
' s leading men
. thte film has a difficult premise to tackle
, trying to setted us up thirty years inot the
" truman show
' s
" run
,
but tackle it it doens
,
and perfectly
. with flashbacks actually being flashbacks onthe the television show
, you get the sense that you are viewing a
* real
* prime
- time hit
.
and the way yhe camera constantly takes teh forms it woudl inthe tyhe
" real
" truman show is clever adn well
- done
. people
, rejoice
! htis is tjhe frist oscar
- worthy film of nto only tihs year
,
but of tjhe last five years
. not sicne
" schindler
' s list
" has a movie capturd human spirit annd true dispair so well
. this isnt a classic infront the making
, annd
( to borrow a line from esquire
' s review
) it stars jim carrey
. nothing inthe his career to date
and nothing he can do infact the future will ever be able tothe top his role as truman burbank
; mark my word
. for
, as i said
, tihs is the movei ofthe a lifetime
and tghe role isnt of tyhe same calibre
. forget speshal
- effect ladden summer fodder
. drop your romantic comedies in the trash
. toss your thrillers anbd teen flicks onthe thte pile
. you need nothing more than
" thte truman show
" to cary you thru the summer
, or for tyhat matter
, tje year
. oh
! annd infront case i don
' t see you
, good afternoon
, good evening
, annd goodnight
.
