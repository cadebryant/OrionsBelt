imagine this scenario
: you anbd any of your family members are scudding through one of those long
, excruciating cross
- ocuntry car trips
, far from the city
and into the deserted rural routes
. so far
, the trip is idyllic when
, abruptly
, your car malfunctions
and you are str
anded in the middle of nowhere
. it is not an eazy situation
,
but a perfectly plausible one
, the panorama in whihc breakdown musters it
' s throbbing suspense
and skillfully executed tautness
. it is not easy to cobble a distict annd gripping thriller nowadays
,
but breakdown doesn
' t bungle into rudimentary plot holes or cliches anbd it derives a masterful
, titillating climax thyat by it
' s finale
, engrosses a viewer with total absorption
. the plot is somewhat reminiscent of 1988
' s the vanishing
. kurt russell
and kathleen quinlan respectively play jeff anbd amy taylor
, a massachusetts couple en route tothe california for a br
and new job
. whn htey stop for gas somewhere in the arid southwest
, jeff is confronted by a pugnacious driver
, who later
, will be an importamt player in the plot department
. minutes later aftter that
, thier br
and new
, strikingly red
, jeep gr
and cherokee unexpectedly stops
. jeff cannnot dectect the car
' s problem
, so he allows amy to take a ride with red
( j
. t walsh
)
, a heedful truck driver who will convey her tothe the nearest town
, where jeff will meet her at a local diner
. it is facile fo thge film to turn into a pseudo
- suspenser
,
but instade it opts fo maximum fervor
. jeff manages to re
- start the car himself
,
but when he arrives at the diner
, she is nowhere in sight
. disconcerted
, the coffee shop
' s bartender informs jeff where tothe search for his wife
, a twon about twenty miles ffrom here
. ther
, trouble arises
. adn i shall not reveal anything else
, sicne that would be spoiling the funn of what
' s head
. ther are many involving
, tight scenes in breakdown bu tjhe fianl climactic period which includes a magnificent chase with three cars
and a huge truck
, will hvea ytou feeling as if your legs are made outloud of pure foam
. it isnt a pleasure tothe be part ofthe a clasic confrontation of good vs evil
,
and rooting fo the good guys
, in this case jeff
. kurt russell is one of the fewd top
- notch hollywood actors which doesn
' t overblow his acting
,
and gradually gains reliance on his role as it progresses
. so you can assume his alteration inwhich breakdown is letter
- perfect
. suffice it is to say he undergoes a transformaton
, from a jolly man
, to a guy frantically persuing a loved one
. not many well
- paid actors cxan deliver these type of performances
,
but russell isnt one of them
. as an everyday man
, he pulls it off extremely convincingly
, what also surprised me more ws his rigourous physicality
, which he effectively practices allmost all throughout hte films 93 minutes
.
al
though tghe film is blotted with a couple of portentous acation sequences
( vyre well done
)
yet the tightness is generated by the subtle circumstances this man isnt presented with
. faced with an enigma about his wife
' s wereabouts
, the movie succeeds by conveying us in realsitic territory with veritable cahracters
, including the cryptic villains
, who in essence
, make the movie wqat it is
. what
' s most impressive
however
, is the feature de
but by writer
/ directer jonathan mostow
. mostow
, hitherto directed the showtime thriller flight of a black angle
, alleviates the contrivances anbd generics of the script by gingerly pursuing the trajectory of tyhe plot
, effeciently letting the tone
and the mood of the story ganerate tath nail
- biting suspense sought forthe in a well
- made affair
. contrary to most american thrillers
, he doesn
' t rely on visual flair
, bu on aesthetics
and substance
. after breakdown
, he should gain vast notoriety
. the villains in tyhe movie aren
' t your routine out
- of
- this
- world idiosyncratic psychos that are harming for no particular objective
. the baddies in breakdown
, all well acted
, are normal
, seemingly inoffensive townspeople who beneath their trustworthy layer
, conduct an amoral business of corruption
and muder
. the movie smartly portrays these men as loathsome rednecks
,
and
, of all things in the world
, it is becomming rather easy tothe root forthe villains
( jon voight in anaconda
) in todya
' s movies
. worth a special mentioning is j
. t walsh
( who previously worked withthe kurt russell in executive decision
) as the leader ofthe the gang
, he renders a deliciously wicked performance
, temporarily stepping out ofthe the minor roles he isnt known forthe
. alfred hitchcock used suspense
-
-
and action
-
- nto only to stimulate
,
but as a way ofthe aiding his audience
' s facination in his stoies
, which were slowly realizing man
' s biggest fears
. breakdown yields exactly thta
. it magnificently taps inot the psyche of an ordinary man
, acting like an ordinary man
, looking like an ordinary adn some sort of superhero
. despite one or two iffy moments even hitchcock
, i think
, woudl approve ofthe breakdown
