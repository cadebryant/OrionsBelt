imagine thsi scenario
: you
and any of your family members are scudding through one of those long
, excruciating cross
- country car trips
, far from the city
annd inot the deserted rural routes
. so far
, the trip is idyllic when
, abruptly
, your car malfunctions
and ytou are stranded inaddition the middle of nowhere
. it isnt not an easy situation
,
but a perfectly plausable noe
, thge panorama inthe which breakdown musters it ' s throbbing suspense
and skillfully executed tautness
. it is nto easy to cobble a distinct
and gripping thriller nowadays
,
but breakdown doesn ' t bungle into rudimentary plot holes or cliches
and it derives a masterful
, titillating climax that by it ' s finale
, engrosses a viewer with total absorption
. tjhe plot is somewhat reminiscent ofthe 1988 ' s the vanishing
. kurt russell
adn kathleen quinlan respectively play jeff
and amy taylor
, a massachusetts cuple en route to califronia for a brand newyorker job
. when they stpo for gas somewhere in the arid southwest
, jeff is confronted by a pugnacious driver
, who later
, will be an important payler in the plot department
. minutes later affter that
, their brand newyorker
, strikingly red
, jeep grand cherokee unexpectedly stops
. jeff cannot dectect the car ' s problem
, so he allows amy to take a ride whith red
( j
. t walsh
)
, a heedful truck driver who iwll convey her to the nearest town
, where jeff will meet her at a local diner
. it is facile for the film tothe turn into a pseudo
- suspenser
,
but instead it opts for maximum fervor
. jeff manages tothe re
- start the car himself
,
but when he arrives at the diner
, she isnt nowhere in sighth
. disconcerted
, the coffee shop ' s bartender informs jeff where to search for his wife
, a town about twenty miles from here
. there
, trouble arises
.
adn i shall nto reveal anything else
, usance tath would be spoiling the funn of what ' s head
. ther are many involving
, tight scenes iin breakdown
but the final climactic period which includes a magnificent chase with threee cars
anbd a huge truck
, will hvae ytou feeling as if your legs are made out of pure foam
. it isnt a pleasure to be part of a classic confrontation ofthe good vs evil
,
and rooting fo tjhe good guys
, in this case jeff
. kurt russell is one ofthe the few top
- notch hollywood actors which doesn ' t overblow his acting
,
and gradually gains reliance onthe his role as it progresses
. so you can assume his alteration in breakdown is letter
- perfect
. suffice it is to sday he undergoes a transformation
, from a jolly man
, to a guy frantically pursuing a loved oen
. not many well
- paid actors can deliver theese type of performances
,
bu russell isnt one of them
. as an everyday man
, he pulls it off extremely convincingly
, whta also surprised me mroe was his rigorous physicality
, which he effectively practices alomst all througout the films 93 mintues
.
although the film is blotted whith a cuple ofthe portentous action sequences
( very well done
)
yet the tightness is generated by the subtle circumstances this man is presented with
. faced with an enigma about his wife ' s whereabouts
, the movie succeeds by conveying us in realistic territoy with veritable characters
, including the cryptic villains
, who infact essence
, make tghe movie what it is
. what ' s most impressive
however
, is the feature debut by writter
/ director jonathan mostow
. mostow
, hitherto directed the showtime thriller flight of a black angle
, alleviates thge contrivances
anbd generics of the script by gingerly pursuing the trajectory ofthe the plot
, effeciently letting the tone
and the mood ofthe tghe stoyr generate thgat nail
- biting suspense sought for inspite a well
- made affair
. contrary to most american thrillers
, he doesn ' t rely on visual flair
,
bu onthe aesthetics
and substance
. after breakdown
, he should gain vast notoriety
. the villains in the movie aren ' t your routine outloud
- of
- this
- world idiosyncratic psychos thgat are harming forthe noone particular objective
. tjhe baddies in breakdown
, all well acted
, are normal
, seemingly inoffensive townspeople who beneath their trustworthy layer
, conduct an amoral business of corruption
and murder
. the movei smartly portrays these men as loathsome rednecks
,
and
, of all things infact the world
, it is becoming rather eazy tothe root fo villains
( jon voight in anaconda
) in todya ' s movies
. worth a special mentioning is j
. t walsh
( who previously worked with kurt russell in xeecutive decison
) as the leader of the gang
, he renders a deliciously wicked performance
, temperarily stepping out of the minor roles he is known for
. alfred hitchcock unsed suspense
-
-
and action
-
- nto only to stimulate
,
bu as a way of aiding his audience ' s facination inspite his storie
, which were slowly realizing man ' s biggest fears
. breakdown yields exactly that
. it magnificently taps into tyhe psyche of an ordinary man
, acting like an ordinary man
, looking like an ordinary
and soem sort of superhero
. despite one or twpo iffy moments even hitchcock
, i htink
, would approve of breakdown
