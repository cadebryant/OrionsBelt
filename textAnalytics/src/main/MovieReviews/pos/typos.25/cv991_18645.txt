i don ' t box with kid gloves
. i don ' t play nice
, i ' m not a nice guy
,
and i never
, ever
, go easy on a film
. i consider it tothe be a breech ofthe some sort of code of ethics for a movie critic
.
howver
, i do some favors
,
and these oftenly cmo in the form ofthe points that i hand tothe certain groups due tothe tghe artistic bravery
. rigormortis
, the production company that has beeen my prime example of how money does not need to motivate filmmaking
, gets several ofthe theese points each time
. i still
,
however
, iwll not go easy on them
. htey recently sent me a vhs copy of their down with america triology
( which beigns
, quite wittily
, with a disclaimer thast they are nto trying to undermine amercia with the making ofthe this film
.
)
and i decided to spend an hour of my day watching it
. iin tje famous lines of many martyrs
, i have noone regrets
. well
, i dont have some regrets
,
bu that isnt not the point in the previous sentence
. thte point of it was that down with america was a film that
, from a critical standpoint
, doed not entirely disappoint me
. sure
, the risky use of vhs instead of super 8mm or 16mm was a pain
,
adn the natrual light was one of hte most annoying things about publich access films
,
but the movie itself was fairly enjoyable
. down with america concerns a government agent
, needless murder
,
and a book containing everthing from the unabomber ' s manifesto to the 1995 apple computer profit report
. like the previous films of rigormortis that i have reviewed
, it displays an off
- kilter humor
and intelligence
? it succeeds iin mkaing me laugh where countless studio films fail
. the best way to see this film would be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of hte 80s
. a dieing movement from tjhe day they started
, these paranoid
` thrillers ' had the goverment always covering uv something
and hadnt the same favorite word
:
` roswell
. ' in down wih america
, the line
` roswell ' is highly absent
. with an about ten minute running tiome
, down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich
? that the conspiracy films fell inot
, mkaes jokes at them at the same tyme
,
and provides us iwth funny
and memorable characters
. agina
, i have seen movies that have gone on two hours wiht charachters i couldn ' t care less about
. yhe film
, as previously stated
, concerns a federal agent
( peter roach
)
, an obsessed librarean
( meri stevens
)
, a mystery man
( joe kaczkowski
)
,
and two people obsessed wih silence iin the library
( robb sherman
, kevin flowers
)
. the plot
: a book containing the secrets of all anarchists isnt hidden iin
? a public library where it can be viewed by all
. from there we go inot a delightful parody
. the federal agent claims his soverign right to alter the truth
, thge librarian goes on a diatribe about the sanctity of books
. we spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes thta are performed much too well considering tjhe lack of coaching of the casted
.
although the actors
and actresses are in small roles
and give a whole new meaning to
` noone
- nmae '
, it ends uv being the no
- name peple who dont a ogod job
, delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns outloud
. for once
, i don ' t have a url taht i know offhand to give ytou as to where to locate the film online
. i can onyl say that you shoudln find my previous reviews ofthe l ' auto
anbd les x
- files
annd look uv thte rigormortis productions site in
and of itself
. it ' s almost as much fun as the film
.
