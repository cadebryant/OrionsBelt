i don
' t box with kid gloves
. i don
' t play nice
, i
' m nto a nice guy
, anbd i never
, ever
, go easy on a film
. i consider it to be a breech of some sort of code of ethics forthe a movie critic
. howver
, i dont soem favors
, adn these often come in tjhe form ofthe points that i h
and to certain groups due tothe tje artistic bravery
. rigormortis
, the production comapany that has been my prime example of how mony does not need to motivate filmmaking
, gets several ofthe these points earch time
. i still
,
however
, will not go easy on them
. tehy recently sent me a vhs copy ofthe their down withthe america triology
( which beigns
, quite wittily
, with a disclaimer that they are nto trying to undermine america whith the making of thsi film
.
)
and i decided tothe spend an hour ofthe my day watching it
. in the faymus lines ofthe many martyrs
, i hve noone regrets
. well
, i do have soem regrets
,
but thyat is not hte point inspite thge previous sentence
. the point of it was that down wtih america was a film that
, from a critical st
andpoint
, doed not entirely dissapoint me
. sure
, tje risky use of vhs instead of super 8mm or 16mm was a pain
,
and the natural light was one ofthe the most annoying things about public access films
, bu the movie itself was fairly enjoyable
. down with america concerns a government agent
, needless muder
,
and a book containing everything from the unabomber
' s manifesto to the 1995 apple computer profit report
. like thge previvous films of rigormortis that i have reviewed
, it displays an off
- kilter humor adn intelligence
? it succeeds in making me laff where countless studio films fail
. the best way to see this film owudl be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of tyhe 80s
. a dying movement from the day they started
, these paranoid
` thrillers
' had the government allways covering up something
and hadnt the same favorite word
:
` roswell
.
' in down with america
, the line
` roswell
' is highly absent
. with an about ten minute running timne
, down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich
? thta tje conspiracy films fell into
, makes jokes at them at the same tyme
, annd provides us with funny
and memorable characters
. again
, i have seen movies that have gone onthe twpo hours with cahracters i couldn
' t care less baout
. the film
, as previously stated
, concerns a federal agent
( peter roach
)
, an obsessed librarian
( meri stevens
)
, a mistery man
( joe kaczkowski
)
, adn twpo people obssessed with silence in the library
( robb sherman
, kevin flowers
)
. the plot
: a book containing the secrets ofthe all anarchists is hidden in
? a public library where it can be viewed by all
. ffrom htere we go into a delightful parody
. tje federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth
, tghe librarian goes on a diatribe about the sanctity of books
. we spend our timne laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well concidering teh lack of coaching ofthe the cast
.
al
though the actors
and actresses are in small roles adn give a whole new meaninng to
` noone
- name
'
, it ends up bieng the noone
- name people who do a good job
, delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns out
. for once
, i don
' t ahev a url that i know offh
and to give you as to where to locate the film online
. i cant only sday that you should fidn my previous reviews of l
' auto anbd les x
- files
and look up the rigormortis productions site in
and of itself
. it
' s almsot as much funn as the film
.
