whith stars like sigourney weaver
(
" aline
" trilogy
) adn academy award winner holly hunter
( the piano
, raising arizona
, etc
.
) together in a single hollywood prodcution
, oney would immediately idenify the film as a potential academy award hot shot
. sadly for copycat
,
though tightly scripted
and nicely plot
, isnt still at heart
, a typical hollywood thriller
. helen
( weaver
)
, after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer
, darryl
( harry connick jr
.
)
, has devolopped a phobia for being outdoors
, so to speak
. incidentally
, helen is also an expert on yhe subject of serial killers
, which mkea her a juicy target forthe serial killer wannabes
. a yearm has pasted
and stange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco
. detective monahan
( hunter
) adn getz
( mulroney
)
, baffled by the unorthodox methods ofthe killing used by tghe killer
, seeks the professional help of helen
, who
, as expected was reluctant at firt
. copycat
" borrows
" a lot from silence of the lambs
and in most cases
, it did wokr
.
but copycat trys to be a little bit moreso by immersing hte audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability
, this was rather uneccesary as tjhe scenes seem to disrupt the mood ofthe teh entire film anbd also
.
.
. much ofthe the time wasted sould
' ve been used to build up the suspense
and injected with drama
. even so
, weaver
and hunter act very well in thier own deparments
.
.
. weaver being the vulnerable
yet strong
- within character
( as infact aliens
) annd hunter being the short
, tough
, texan speaking cop
( as infact raising arizona
)
. harry connick jr
.
, a very good jazz singer
, shines as thte imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter
. which comes to the moment of judgement
( drum roll please
.
.
.
)
. copycat isnt a good thriller
.
al
though the plot is highly predictable
and one can actually predict tyhe rest of the movie after about 45 minutes into the show
, copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats
, in anticipation of the killers next immediate move
. tihs worked preety well
and will offer audiences a couple ofthe unexpected jolts
. nice movie to bring your girlfriend to
