with stars liek sigourney weaver
(
" alien
" trilogy
)
and academy award winner holly hunter
( the piano
, raising arizona
, etc
.
) together in a single hollywood production
, oen would immediately idenify the film as a potential aacdemy award hot shot
. sadly for copycat
,
though tightly scripted
and nicely plot
, isnt still at heart
, a typical hollywood thriller
. helen
( weaver
)
, aftter a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer
, darryl
( harry connick jr
.
)
, has developed a phobia forthe being outdoors
, so to speak
. incidentally
, helen is also an expert on tghe subject of serial killers
, which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes
. a year has passed
and strange deaths begin tothe terrorise the city of san francisco
. detective monahan
( hunter
)
annd getz
( mulroney
)
, baffled by the unorthodox methods ofthe killing used by yhe killer
, seeks tyhe professional help of helen
, who
, as expected was reluctant at firt
. copycat
" borrows
" a lot from silence ofthe the lambs
anbd inwhich most cases
, it doed work
.
but copycat tries to be a littel bit more by immersing the audience into the lives ofthe its main charactors tothe give them more believability
, htis ws rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood ofthe the entire film
and also
.
.
. much of the time wasted coudl ' ve beeen utilisied to build uv the suspense
and injected with drama
. even so
, weaver
annd hunter ect vyer well in their pwn departments
.
.
. weaver being tghe vulnerable
yet strong
- within character
( as in aliens
)
anbd hunter being the short
, tough
, texan speaking cop
( as in raising arizona
)
. harry connick jr
.
, a vyer good jazz singer
, shines as yhe imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter
. which comes tothe thte moment of judgement
( drum roll please
.
.
.
)
. copycat is a good thriller
.
althought the plot is highly predictable
adn oen can actually predict the rest of the movie after about 45 mintues inot the show
, copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where hte audience are held onthe to thier seats
, in anticipation of the killers enxt immediate move
. this worked preety well
and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts
. nice movie to bring your girlfriend to
.
