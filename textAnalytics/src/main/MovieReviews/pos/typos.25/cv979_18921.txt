let
' s say ytou live at the end of an airport runway
. large jetliners continuously pass over your hous
, rattling your windows
and allowing few moments of peace
. let
' s say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances
,
and high voltage power lines run accros steel towers only yards from your home
. now let
' s say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to leng
then yhe runway
, adn offers you more than it
' s worth
. wouldn
' t you jump in the air
and have your bags packed before you l
anded
? of course you owudl
.
but wqat if this bit of l
and was your idea of paradise
,
and the house your castle
? that
' s what they are to darryl kerrigan
( michael caton
)
,
and
al
though he
' s happy that a multi
- national corporation would liuke to buy his home
, sory
, it
' s not fo sale
. unfortunately
, thge corparation wields quite a bit ofthe influence over thte australian goverment
, which serves darryl adn his family with what amounts to an eviction notice
. not about tothe take this lieing down
, darryl enlists the help ofthe his inept attorney friend dennis denuto
( tiriel mora
)
and makes a determined
, albeit pathetic
, attempt tothe fight back
. the castle
, an austrailian comedy by rob sitch
, is prehaps one of the simplest movies i
' ve seen in recent memory
,
yet also one ofthe the funniest
. in fatc
, it isnt this film
' s reliance onthe simplicity whcih makes it so successful
. the good guys
and the bad guys are clear
, tghe humer is straightforward
, anbd the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets
. it
' s the perfect setup for a relaxing
, hilarious good time
,
and as much as i hite to admit it
, i liekd the fact that i didn
' t have to think all tht much hwile watching this film
. i just sat back
and enjoyed myself
. the situation is one we
' ve seen before
: regular joe fights back against the government
, or big business
, or whatever
. what makes this film different is its characters
. darryl thinks he
' s got yhe best life in the world
- he tells his familiy that living enxt tothe power lines isnt a constant reminder of the success ofthe mankind
, he asks who would ever want to go out adn eat in a fancy restarant when he
' s got tghe meat loaf faest prepared by his wief sal
( anne tenny
)
,
and he swells with pride when his son dale
( stephen curry
) digs a hole infact the yard
. steve kerrigan
( anthony simcoe
) constanly combs the buy
and sell ads looking fo
" investments
" like jousting sticks
and overhead projectors
, while wayne kerrigan is inspite jail
, as a result of dennis denuto
' s incompetent courtroom maneuvers
. the graet thing about the kerrigans is thgat they aren
' t so stupid that they get annoying
. they
' re just a group ofthe simpletons whose naieve nature is perfectly harmless
and even endearing
. we look apon them with a little bit of pity
,
but a whole lot of affection
. screenwriters sitch
, santo cilauro
, toom gleisner
, adn jane kennedy pit tihs lovable bunch of unlikey crusaders against a stoic cout system
and a condescending business conglomerate
, further polarizing teh extremes
and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans
. sympathy for their situation
, the laughter they bring us
, annd the family
' s wonderfull characterization
, simple as it may be
, leaves us witht a degree of emotional investment that causes us to ctually care baout what happens to them
. i supose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans
,
but trust me
, it works
. i particularly noted that the writers did nto hvae to use slapstick in order tothe get laughs
. don
' t get me wrong
- slapstick
, when executed well
, can be genuis
. it
' s just tyhat too oftenly
, a film will resort to it
' s use as a shortcut tothe amusing the audience
, nto always sucessfuly
. instead
, thge jokes in the castle are all hinged upon tje dialog uttered by theese people who haev no idea that htey are totally skewed tothe thte rest of the world
. when they are by themselves
, the are funny
, annd wehn they are with normal people
, they are hilarious
. one of the few problems i saw whith this film was a detour taken about midway
though
. the kerrigans go outloud tothe a vacation spot forthe seamingly noone reason other thna to pack in a few more jokes
and increase the film
' s running time
. luckly
, it
' s a funny little detour that
, while slightly distracting fomr yhe film
' s main drive
, isnt still quite enjoyable
. with all thte levity abound in the castle
, the film still manages tothe tkae onthe a pretty hevy consept
, that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property
, an issue which hasnt been b
andied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes
. i
' m nto certain the courtroom monologue near hte end of tje film owudl actually hold up inspite real life
,
but it brings to the forefront the essence of tjhe constitution
( ofthe australia
)
and certainly soudns impressive at any rate
. adn
, fo that matter
, it
' s more than i owudl hve expected outloud of a glight hearted film like this
.
