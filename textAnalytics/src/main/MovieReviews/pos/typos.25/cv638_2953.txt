naturual born killers is realyl a very simple story thta
, in esence
, has already been told in bonnie
& clyde with some major varations in emphasis
, mood
and degree
. both films glamorize
" outlaws
,
" in one case bank robbers
and killers
and inthe the other massmedia murderers
. both relate the story of a couple liberated by love
. bu where bonnie
& clyde was partial
and subtle
, natural born killers is total
and blatant
. where bonnie
& clyde was social
, natural born killers is psychological
. whta bonnie
& clyde hinted at
, natural born killers confronts
and explores
. what bonnie
and clyde stole
, mickey
and mallory kill
. to examine naturual born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey ofthe realization
and exposure of the frauds surrounding them
, exressed metaphorically as killing
, subdues the mysterious power thsi film wields
. for the most part
, when mickey
and mallory kill
, they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily
, htey kill what is trying to kill them
, they kill what dissembles
and cowers from life
, they kill what needs to be killed
. this mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity
. brahma created
. vishnu preserved
.
and siva destroyed
, bu he destroyed what needed to be destroyed tothe make way for teh usefull creations of brahma
. the following may be painfully mundane
but metaphorically so accurate
, i
' m forced to say it for clarity
' s sake
: a plumber must remove the old lead anbd copper pipes
, thast is
, destory the old plumbing system in order to replace it with yhe new one made ofthe plastics
. your plumber
, bonnie
and clyde
, mickey
and mallory
, anbd siva are all productive destroyers
. i think yuo could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing adn death
, presently
and historically
, thna any other phenonmena
. muslims kill christians
. hindus kill muslims
. christians kill pagans
. jews kill christians
, etc
. you coudl reverse subject
and predicate in eahc instance
and still not be challenged
. religion is an orgy of killing
. teh institution of the state onyl misses frist place for technical reasons like it hasn
' t been a major player fo as long or yhe two are frequently indistinguishable
.
" the state is thge divine idea upon earth
,
" hegel said
, meaning it is absolute
, all
- powerful
, ineffable
, unassailable
, infallable
, authoritarian
and patriarchal just liek jhvh
, allah
, god
, etc
. well
, what does all this have to do with natural born killers
? let me frist say that religions of thsi nature
, in tyhe ideal
, take the place of sex
. consider the catholic church
, which inspite its hey
- dey
, took religion as seriously as any other religeon or institution ever
. god takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope
, cardinals
, bishops
, monks
, etc
. they forego the one
, in order tothe cmo closer to yhe otehr
. during the middle ages
, when this doctrine was unmitigated
and unchallenged
, the most repressive regime thge west has ever known in terms of scope
and magnitude rose tothe pwoer
.
( parenthetically
, witness plato as well
. in the republic
, he attempted to lauch the first systematic absolutist regime
. not coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself
, regularly assailing the passions
.
) catholicism
, as policy
, attacks the passions as evil
. it sees intercourse onyl as a means to perpetuate the species nto as a way to pleasure
. masturbation isnt consdidered a sin with the sacrament ofthe penance necessary fo absolution
. this is religion
, this is authoritarianism inaddition its essence
. as further evidence
, the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters
. our culture
, most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thous
ands of yersa
. we can
' t help
but adopt
, even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes
, leading to a destructive splitted between the biological adn social self
. mickey adn mallory knox internalized them
, too
,
then thru spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one ofthe them by the presense of the other
, dicovered them
,
and began expurgating them from themselves
and from the world in the process unifying themselves
. it is a straightforward liberation through sex
. as some ogod patriarch once observed
,
" you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on
.
" m
& m hadnt a vision of waht the world woudl be like wihtout contradictions
. they saw whta civilization
and culture
and everyday life would be liek under such condidtions
.
" the moment of realization is worth a thous
and prayers
,
" as mickey sasy
. as a the most consistent annd impassioned criteak of western culture htere is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter
: let us look each other inthe the face
. we are hyberboreans
-
- we know well enough how remote our place is
.
" neither by l
and nor by water will yuo fidn the road tothe tyhe hyberboreans
"
: even pindar
, infront his day
, knew taht much about us
. beyond the noth
, beyond ice
, beyond death
-
- our life
, our happiness
.
.
.
. we hvea dicovered that happiness
; we know the way
; we got our knowledge ofthe it from thous
ands ofthe years in the labyrinth
. who else has found it
?
-
- tghe man of today
?
-
-
" i don
' t know eather the way out or the way iin
; i am whatever doesn
' t know eather the way outloud or the way in
"
-
- so sighs hte man of todya
.
.
.
. tihs is teh sort of modernity thyat made us ill
-
- we sickened in lazy peace
, cowardly comprimise
, the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea
and nay
. this tolerance
and largeur ofthe tghe heart that
" forgives
" everthing becasue it
" underst
ands
" everyting is a sirocco to us
. rather live amid the ice than amonst modern virtues adn other such sourth
- winds
! as far as i cxan tell
, this is whta tghe movie has to say
. its alleged critique of the media isnt only secondary
, tertiary
, quaternary
, subsidiary forthe sure
. for example wayne gayle
' s first report ends with some gen x dude saying
,
" if i were a mass murderer i
' d be mickey
and mallory
,
" in his most exelent bill anbd ted voice
. onthe one levle you cd make the humdrum observation that beacuse the media had glamorized theese twpo psychopaths that the uncritical
, impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the marter
and took them for heroes
. it seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what m
& m weere uv tothe
and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself he
' d be just like them
, killing
and destroying what deserves it
. let me exemplify what i
' ve been saying by analyzing a scene fomr the film
, namely the scene where mallory fucks tyhe gas station attendent
, kills him
,
and
then castigates him for giving her
" the worst fuckin
' head i
' ve ever hadnt in my life
!
!
!
" now
, i never claimed that mickey anbd mallory hadnt a perfect relationship
, because demonstrably they didn
' t
,
and this scene adn the ones leading up to it show us this
. somtimes they are tjhe source of each others frustrations
, bu unwilling to kill each other
, since they lveo each other so much
and are responsible for earch others liberation
, they must kill inaddition place of their lever
. it
' s no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey
. as the attendant approached he tookover onthe mickey
' s character in thge eyes of mallory
. she needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room
and wass haveing secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory
. upon discovery
, mallory views this as a betrayal
, judges him
, annd commutes his sentence on someone else
. yhe style of hte movie is a whole
' nother matter that i won
' t get into very deeply bu surely it is partially responsibile for its power
. let me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrende or tje liek suggesting the expansiveness
, barreness
and boredom of tje frontier lifestyle
. hte repid succession of all those 8mm
, 16mm
, 35mm images from various perspectives with a sountrack somtimes in sync
and sometimes out ofthe sink instills a skittish
, frenetic mood
. also
, jungian archtypes abound
. these cant
' t help
but trigger deep pyschological responses we can barely underst
and expecially wehn htey flash across the screen for bearly a few frames
. smoe of the best scenes annd lines that come to mind
.
( quotes are paraphrased only
)
: mickey to mallory
:
" one ofthe these days i
' m gonna be cummin
' forthe you
,
" in prison
, while mallory jacks mickey off
. semen isnt a symbol for great potential
and things tothe come
. at tje tiome tehy haven
' t
yet hadnt sex nor have htey killed anyone yot
. the two of course go h
and in h
and
. forthe an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs
. mickey druing his marriage tothe mallory
:
" as creator of my universe
, i pronounce us man
and wife
.
" hte way woody delivers this line is truly haunting
,
but telling
, too
. it reveals m
& m are well onthe their way to expunging all their destructive tendencies
and replacing them with positve ones
. this is whta mickey means by
" creator of my universe
,
" he is giving hismelf or creating for himself healthy attitudes
. it is not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it frist appears
. scagnetti
' s first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from yhe gas station attendant
' s mouth
. the indian sage releasing mallory
' s father
, who was reincarnated as a snake
:
" old man
, go be a snake
,
" after telling his
" snake story
" that ends with
" bitch
, yuo knew i was a snake
.
" after mickey shoots this sage tothe death during a bewildering nightmare
, mallory says
,
" you killed life
!
!
!
" this is another telling quote because it implies tehy didn
' t see themselves as killers of life
.
then what were they killing uv to that time
? in some case just those zombies faking their way thru life
, the living dead
, as it were
. in other cases
, all the anti
- life forces
, the cops
and their parents
. the
butterfly just before the movie shifts inot the prison
. it of course symbolizes rebirth
. dr
. emil reingold
, as portrayed by steven wright
, passing judgement onthe m
& m
:
" mickey
and mallory know the difference between right anbd wrong
, tehy just don
' t give a damn
.
" this is reminiscent ofthe nietzsche
' s hwole philisophy
,
and maybe a direct reference to his beyond good anbd evil
. mickey
:
" the rabbit says the moment ofthe realization is worth 1000 prayers
.
" mickey
( again in his interview
)
:
" me
and ytou
, we are not the smae species
.
" notice when teh escape is infront progress we git some role reversals iin terms of leadership annd control
. mickey thte prisoner becomes the leader of his little gang
. the wardens become prisoners
and tjhe civilians like wayne gayle
and his producer followup the leader
, no matter who it is
. mickey
: how ya feelin
'
? wayne
: fucking great
! mickey
: yuo got the feelin
'
? wayne
: i
' m alive
. i
' m alive forthe the first fuckin
' time
! what an incredible transformation this is
. he got the feeling
and he couldn
' t contain himself
. waht a feeling
. tyhat feeling of metaphysical freedom that you can create your own universe
. mickey when almost caught in a dead end
,
" think
, thikn
, think
, think
.
" go figure it out
. dwight
( tommy lee jones
) in general
, because he may be yhe sickest fuck in the whole film
. his wohle attitude can be summed up with
,
" destroy them
!
!
!
"
