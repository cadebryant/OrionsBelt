a fully loaded entertainment review
- website coming in july
!
> from ace ventura tothe truman burbank
, jim carrey has run the wohle gamut ofthe comic
, yot sympathetic
, characters
. 1996
' s the cable guy was supposed tothe be his big
" breakthrough
" role ffrom zany humer into darker
, more dramatic acting
. as most everyone knows
, the results weere
, well
, less
- than
- stellar
. not only did the film not dont so hot at the box office
, bu it was also panned by critics
. as far as i know
, gene siskel
and i are the only ones willing to admited that we dug it
. the first time i saw the cable guy
, in theatres
, i wass in super critic
- mode
,
and didn
' t really like it
. howver
, due to the fact that hbo shows the movie eveyr single day
, i
' ve had tiem to lean back
, relax
, anbd tkae in the film
.
and tothe my surprise
, it grew onthe me
. tjhe plot is rather simple
: broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy
, played by carrey
,
then isnt stalked by him whn steven tries to break off tjhe relationship
. see
, steven
' s been having some problems with his girlfriend
, robin
( leslie mann
)
,
and he doesn
' t think he has any more room in his life for a new friend
. allso
, some of hte cable guy
' s antics have been creeping him out
. carrey
, as the cable guy
, gives steven varous aliases
, which later we find out are all tv characters
: larry tate
, chip douglas
, ricky ricardo
, etc
. he apparently lives in his cable van
, anbd while many critics didn
' t enjoy tihs newer
, darker
, less
- manic peformance from carrey
, i
thought it was interesting
and rather well
- done
. for me
, its not the movie as a whole that
' s enjoyable
,
but rether several individual scenes
: a karaoke jam at steven
' s apartment
, a medieval fight at a theme restaurant
, adn a bathroom beating
( a la liar
, liar
)
, just to nmae a few
. perhasp the fact that mroe of carrey
' s humoros side comes out during theese scenes is what mkaes them so funny
.
and if ytou really want to see something
, you
' ve got tothe hear his version of jefferson airplane
' s
" somebody to love
"
, sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam
. the cable guy hasnt its bad spots
, like most any movie
. i didn
' t partiularly like steven
' s girlfriend
,
and i felt that more focus shoudl have been unsed on the relatiopnship between steven
and his best firend
. also
, the ending
, while hvaing you fooled for a moent
, isnt rether contrived
,
and somewhat dissapointing
. still
, i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture
; if you
' re at the video stoer
and can
' t think of anytying to rent
, i suggest you try it outloud
. or if you have hbo
, jstu wait till it comes on
( you won
' t have to wait long
.
) hell
, that
' s what i do eveyr day
.
