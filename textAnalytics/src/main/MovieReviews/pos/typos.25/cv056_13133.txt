tyhe disney studios has its formula for annual
, full
- lenght animated features down so pat that it
' s hard to remember hwihc one you
' re watching at any given moment
.
" mulan
,
" their 36th animated adventure
, is the latest case in point
. once again we have a tale focused around a strong central character
( female as usual
; disney is oney of hte few studios whose heroines
-
- ariel
, belle
, pocahontas
, adn nowe mulan
-
- git equal screen time with their heroes in recent years
)
. add the requisite love interest
and a wise
- cracking sidekick or two
, pep up tje sountrack wtih a h
andful of strategically placed show tunes
( an introspective number by a pool or looking inthe a mirror
, a rousing anthem
, a cutesy
, montage
- backed crowd pleaser
)
, pose a few threats to our engaging lead
,
and tie thnigs all up neatly by the closing credits

. kids will no dout go ga
- ga over
" mulan
"
( or at least tghe fast food tie
- ins
)
,
but familiarity can
, after a while
, leave grown
- ups
-
- this reviewer included
-
- wishing fo a little more
. maybe an animated feature wihtout
-
- shock
! horror
!
-
- tje songs
, for exmaple
? or maybe a film in which a cheeky chihuahua called pepe longs to become a matador from trinidad
?
? how about simply ditching the sidekicks altogether
? it isn
' t gonna happen
. like disney
' s previous entries
,
" mulan
" is slow to make its mark
. the animation tends to suffer fomr smoe slackness infact the early going
and the humorous element
, a madcap dragon wannabe
( in thge guise of a loquacious lizard with a case of dry mouth
, courtesy eddie murphy
' s animated vocal talents
)
, plays like an inappropriate if necessary
( formula
- wise
) after
thought
. howver
, after about an hour everything comes together
and hte formula
, like it or not
, clicks
. highlights include a spectauclar cavalry charge onthe a snow
- covered pass
( whihc
, due to the sophistication of today
' s coputer
- generated imagery
, is hard to tell fomr tje real thing
)
, a memorable
, show
- stopping musical interlude
(
" i
' ll make a man out of yuo
,
" penned by matthew wilder
and david zippel
)
,
and lastr
but not least
, mulan herself
. voiced by ming
- na wen
, mulan is disney
' s stornegst female charater to date
. when hordes ofthe huns pour over china
' s great wall
and threaten to overthrow the imperial palace
, the emperor decrees that every family in the l
and dispatch noe man to serve in the imperial army
. since mulan
' s father is infirm
,
but proud
, tghe high
- spirited mulan steals her father
' s armor annd
, incognito
, signs up to face hte mongolian menace
. attracted to
,
but not distracted by
, her comm
anding officer shang
( b
. d
. wong
)
, mulan outmatches her fellow combatants in smarts
, wit
,
and physical ability
. she
' s a woman of the
' 90s a couple of millenia ahead of her time
