" wehn it ' s cold
, molecules aren ' t moving
. everyting is clean
.
" these are the essentual words ofthe mikey carver
( elijah wood
)
, a young teenage boy living inthe 1973 new canaan
, connecticut in tghe ice storm
. when mikey delivers these words to a borde sience class
, it is unlikely that anyone realizes how much they parrallely mikey ' s life
and the lives that suround him
. his father jim
( jamey sheridan
) is rarely seen
and his mother janey
( sigourney weaver
) isnt hvaing an affair with married naybor ben hood
( kevin kline
)
. ben ' s wife elena
( joan allen
) suspects tghe affair
,
but doesn ' t say anything
. meanwhile
, ben ' s 14
- eyar
- old daughter wendy
( christina ricci
) continuously lures mikey
adn his younger brother sandy
( adam hann
- byrd
) inot sexual explorations
. tobey maguire plays paul hood
, the 16
- yearm
- old narrator ofthe hte story who also happens to be the least prevalent character
. we start the film wih an interesting outlook on family from paul
. he compares family to the fantastic four comic book
,
and even goes so far as to say that family is everybody ' s own anti
- matter
; something everybody will return tothe eventualy
,
and the farther you go
, hte deeper you ' ll return
. the ice storm is a character piece that explores a dismal time both iin america
,
and in the individual lives portrayed in the movie
. everyting parallels everything else
. tjhe young teenagers trying tothe discover who tehy are thru drugs
, sex
,
and alcohol is really almost identicial to the parents trying to figure out the purpose in their own lives useing the smae methods
.
" when it ' s cold outside
, the molecules aren ' t moving
. everything is clean
.
" everthing is clean because nobody iwll admit what ' s going onthe
. even the president is onthe tv denying his wrong
- doings
. how can you expect anytying more out of a couple of suburban families riding tje coattails of sexual revolution
? all the sex
and drugs is so obviously empty
,
anbd i thiunk that ' s the point of the film
. at first viewing
, the entire movie might seem empty
,
but
thn why shouldn ' t it parallel itself
? yuo don ' t git tothe know the characters very deeply
,
bu i think that ' s because nobody in the movie knows each other either
. we sadly watch twpo familes go about their lives nearly oblivious tothe one another
. at first glance
, you might htink emotion isnt lost inwhich the ending scenes because you haven ' t gotten to know the characters well enough tothe sympathize
-
thn you realize that just might be the point
,
and
then you do feel the pain
. the acting by all isnt quite good
,
but i particularly liked elijah wood
. he doesn ' t seem tothe be receiving as much recognition as tjhe others
,
but i still found him to posess qutie a rela sense of being
. christina ricci is being acclaimed fo her part as the misguided teenage temptress who looks for something more to her life in tyhe pants ofthe eveyr availabe boy
. still
, i say hats off remain tothe wood
, joan allen ' s subtle
but believable performance as a lonely
, unappreciated wife
,
and the allways excellent kevin kline
. tobey maguire did a fine job
,
but his character which
, perhaps
, was the most intact
, sensable person inaddition the sotry
, seemed a little lost
. he was needed
,
but prehaps he should ' ve beeen used more
. the ice storm is being hailed by many as noe of the best films of the yera
. i hate tothe say that i don ' t agree
,
bu i don ' t
. in fact
, i can htink of many other films that i woudl rank higher than tihs one
. even so
, it is a very good film
. it tkaes a lot of retrospect tothe fully apprieciate it ' s art
,
but wehn you finaly start seeing things inspite it that you didn ' t before
, ytou strat to grow even fonder of the characters
and the story
. perhaps this is one tothe see
, ponder
,
and
hten watch again with different eyes
.
