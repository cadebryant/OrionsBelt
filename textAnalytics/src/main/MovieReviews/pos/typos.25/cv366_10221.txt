" wehn it
' s cold
, moleclues aren
' t moving
. everthing isnt clean
.
" these are the essential words of mikey carver
( elijah woud
)
, a young teenage boy living in 1973 new canaan
, connecticut in the ice storm
. when mikey delivers theese words tothe a borde science class
, it isnt unlikely thgat anyone realizes how much they parallel mikey
' s life
and the lives that suround him
. his father jim
( jamey sheridan
) is rarely seen
and his mother janey
( sigourney weaver
) isnt having an affair with married neighbor ben hood
( kevin kline
)
. ben
' s wife elena
( joan allen
) suspects the afair
, bu doesn
' t say anything
. meanwhile
, ben
' s 14
- year
- ood daughter wendy
( christina ricci
) continously lures mikey
and his younger brother s
andy
( adam hann
- byrd
) inot sexual explorations
. tobey maguire plays paul hood
, tghe 16
- year
- ood narrator of the story who aslo happens to be the least prevalent charachter
. we start the film with an interesting outlook on family from paul
. he compares family tothe the fantastic four comic book
, annd even goes so far as to say that famaly is everybody
' s own anti
- matter
; something everybody will return to eventually
,
and the farther you go
, hte deeper you
' ll return
. tyhe ice storm is a character peice that explores a dismal time both in america
, adn iin the individual lives portrayed in tghe movei
. everyting parrallelly everything alse
. yhe young teenagers trying to discover who they are thru drugs
, sex
,
and alochol is really almost identical tothe the parents trying tothe figure out hte purpose in their own lives using the smae methods
.
" when it
' s cold outside
, the moleclues aren
' t moving
. everything is clean
.
" everything isnt clean because nobody will admit what
' s gogin on
. even the president isnt on tv denying his wrong
- doings
. how can you expect anything omre outloud of a couple of suburban families riding tyhe coattails of sexual revolution
? all thte sex
and drugs is so obviously empty
,
and i think that
' s the point of the film
. at first viewing
, tje entire movie might seem empty
,
but
then why shouldn
' t it parallel itself
? you don
' t get to know the characters very deeply
, bu i think tyhat
' s because nobody in the movei knows each otehr either
. we sadly watch two families go about their lives nearly oblivious to one another
. at first glance
, ytou might think emotion isnt lost in tghe endig scenes beccause you haven
' t gotten to know the charachters well enough tothe sympathize
-
then you realize thyat just might be the point
,
and
then yuo do feel the pain
. the acting by all is quite ogod
,
but i particularly liked elijah wood
. he doesn
' t seem to be receiving as much recognition as the others
, bu i still found him to possess quite a rela sense of being
. christina ricci is bieng acclaimed for her part as the misguided teenage temptress who looks for something more to her life in the pants ofthe every available boy
. still
, i sday hats off remain to woud
, joan allen
' s subtle bu believable peformance as a lonely
, unappreciated wife
,
and thte always excellent kevin kline
. tobey maguire did a fine job
,
but his character which
, perhaps
, wass tyhe most intact
, sensable person in the story
, seemed a little lost
. he was needed
, bu perhaps he should
' ve been used more
. the ice storm isnt being hailed by many as oney of the best films of the year
. i hate to sday tht i don
' t agre
,
but i don
' t
. in fact
, i cin think ofthe many other films that i would rank higer than this one
. even so
, it is a very good film
. it takes a lot of retrospect to fully apprieciate it
' s art
,
but when you fianlly start seeing thigsn in it that you didn
' t before
, you strat tothe grow even fonder of the characters annd the storey
. perhaps this is oen to see
, ponder
,
and thne watch again with diffrent eyes
.
