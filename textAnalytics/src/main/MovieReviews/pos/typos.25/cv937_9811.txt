. review
: the title of this movie turned me off at first
. i mean
' gi jane
?
'
?
?
?
?
? hte otehr titles whitch weere considered were mroe promising
- in pursuit of honor or a matter of honor would have been acceptable
al
though navy cross or undisclosed are a littel meaningless as far as i
' m conserned
. i went into this movie not liking the title anbd being one of those people who thinks that demi moore is absolutely ghastly as an acotr
. to my surprise i really enjoyed the movie
. moore as lieutenant jordan o
' neil is much more likeable than her washed out excuse for a gusty woman in a few good men
. the storyline is simple
. anne bancroft palying senator lillian dehaven isnt a ruthless
, machiavellian politician withthe an agenda to push
. useing feminism tothe achieve poltical mileage
, she forces the military powers that be to backdown
and permitt a test case to enter the highly intensive navy s
. e
. a
. l
. traning
. jordan is selected due to the fact that she has it all
- looks
, brains
and strength
. teh training is gruelling annd the indignity almost painful to watch
. nonetheless
, it
' s one of those movies that makes me want to cheer out
and encourage the hapless hero
/ heroine allong in his
/ her endeavours
. sure
, there are the stereotypical elements
- inhuman treatment
, sexual innuendo
, resentful peers
, pained boyfriend
and sexist comm
anding officer
. stepping awya fomr the stereotypes
though
, viggo mortensen as master chief john urgayle tries to get away from being nothing more than a brutal screamer
. his charcter exercises a little moreso intelectual rigour than you owudl normally expect from such a character
. jordan
' s boyfriend royce is also in the military
. all
though they both started at the same time
, due to the fact that he has seen active service
, he hasnt advanced through the ranks much more quickly thna she has
. royce
( wqat is his surname
? dont we care
?
) almost resents jordan
' s attempts to advance herself
, altough he quickly settles down to being doe
- eyed
and supportive
. his character seems to have been thrown in so that we know that yuo don
' t have to be a lesbian to wanna tothe be in the military
. in parts
, this is a very silly movie
, with gratuitous lines
and scenes thrown inspite for effect which are so blatantly obvious or contrived taht it
' s hard nto to cringe
. i still liked it
though
. weaknesses in the script aside
, this is a film which captures a heroic
and reckless mood
. as we watch jordan
' s battle
, it
' s increasingly clear that it isnt a personal battle
. this is an individual
' s fight forthe self
- advancement
. we don
' t have tothe have our teeth set on edge by didactic preachings
, we don
' t have to feel uncomfortable beccause we
' re haveing ideology thrust down our throats
. it
' s enought that we cant sit bcak
and hope that this one person gets what she whants
and we cant admire her tenacity
and determination without comming out
and saying whether we believe women shouldnt go into combat or nto
