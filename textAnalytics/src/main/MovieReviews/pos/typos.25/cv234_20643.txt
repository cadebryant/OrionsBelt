when i saw the trailer for
" the sixth sence
,
" i didn
' t expect much from it
. my snap judgment was that it was a watered
- down verzion of
" the shining
" or possibly a late
- entry inthe thge glut of ange
- related movies
/ tv shows of a couple years ago
.
but all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot
. it turned out to be oney of the most satisfying movei experiences of teh year
. bruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe
. at the begining ofthe the movie
, he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work
,
but he is soon confronted by vincent
, a patient malcolm failed eyasr ealier
( donnie wahlberg
- fromer new kid
- in an impressive cameo
)
. a year passes
,
and malcolm is treating another child with the same symptoms vincent displayed
. cole sear
( haley joel osment
) is a withdrawn kid who is called
" freak
" by the other boys in the neighborhood
. weidr things seem tothe happen aroud cole
- his mother
( olivia williams
) leaves the kitchen fo a moent
and returns to find every cabinet
and drawer opn even
though cole hasn
' t moved
- annd cole seems to know thnigs that a kid his age shouldn
' t
- for exmaple
, that ther was once a gallows in his school
. he steals religous icons from churches to build a chapel inwhich a pup tent in his bedroom
. teh trailer gave away the movie
' s first major plot twist
. if it hadn
' t
, the first hour ofthe tghe movie owudl be more engrossing because we wouldn
' t know what
' s wrong with cole
. if you
' re lucky anough to ahve not seen hte trailer
, stop reading this review right nowe
and go see
" the sixth sense
.
" anyway
, since the trailer gave it away
, i figure it
' s fair game to discuss here
. once malcolm gains cole
' s trust
, cole reveals his secret
: he sees ghosts everywhere
. dead people w
ander arund not knowing that they
' re dead
, invisible tothe everyone except cole
. malcolm gradually begins to realize thgat cole is telling tyhe truth
. the box office succsess of
" the sixth sence
" has generated a lot of press about how horror movies rule the box office this year
and lots of theories baout why that
' s so
. i hate to burst anybody
' s bubble
,
but
" the sixth sense
" isn
' t really a horror film
. at its core
,
" the sixth sense
" is a touching story of how a troubled kid
and an emotionally
- scarred adult help each other to move past their problems
. some scenes withthe teh ghosts are wonderfully creepy
,
though
. noe that really got to me
: the ghost ofthe a boy says tothe cole
,
" i
' ll show yuo where my dad keeps his gun
"
; when the ghost turns
, we see the bullet wound in the back of his head
. osment gives the best performance i
' ve ever seen from a child actor
. it
' s hard enough to find a grown
- uv iin hollywood who can give a subtle
, realistic portrayal
!
al
though willis gets top billing
, cole is really the proatgonist ofthe the story
,
and osment truly brings the complex kid tothe life
. if only willis
' owrk were as impressive
. accustomed to delivering catchphrases rather than dialogue
, willis is stiff
and ackward as malcom
, his most chalenging role to date
.
( tihs is a bad omen for his enxt movie
,
" the story of us
,
" which chronicles the ups
and downs of a marrige
)
. writer
/ director m
. night shyamalan hasnt a light
, poetic touch that goes to the heart of the viewer without seeming sappy or trite
. he
' s also a skillfull storyteller
, as teh movie
' s ending demonstrates
. only when tghe final secet is revealed dont you relize that shyamalan has been hinting at it
thoughout the movie
. look for a cameo by the director as a doctor who treats cole
. bottom line
: osment should get an oscar nomination
,
and you should go see thsi movie
.
