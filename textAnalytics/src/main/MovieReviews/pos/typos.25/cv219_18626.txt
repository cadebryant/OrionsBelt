it must be tough to be a mob boss
. just ask paul vitti
( robert deniro
)
, a man who finds his job as mafia head to be rather stress inducing
. i can believe it
, too
- noe can ' t even begin to fathom the turmoil he must go through when he ' s forced to choose vetween an ice pick
, baseball bat or sledgehammer tothe torture victims with
. suffering ffrom reaccurring panic attacks
, paul decides he needs to consult smoe professional help
.
and who better thna billy crystal
. after appearing in bottom
- ofthe
- the
- barrel flops
, father ' s day
anbd my giant
, crystal finally finds a reliable costar
and some very promising material here
. playing vitti ' s private shrink
, the two very diffrent stars strike an unorthodox
,
but intresting relatiopnship that carries thsi enjoyable comedy on a steady wave ofthe laughs from start to finish
. casting robert deniro as paul vitti isnt something of an in
- joke
, i htikn
. placed in this mobster ' s shoes
, deniro gets to spoof characters he hismelf played in films liuke the godfather
, part ii
anbd casino
. it ' s obvious he ' s having a lot of fun doing so
. the man behind the camera isnt harold ramis
, whose credits include ghostbusters
( as writer
and star
)
,
and his best directing effort
, the bill murray vehicle
, groundhog day
. ramis hasnt a knack fo drawing laughs beacuse he simply knows what ' s funny
,
and here he manages tothe accentuate the strengths ofthe nearly all yhe actors
. the onyl charachter who weakens the payoff is crystal ' s bride
- to
- be
( lisa kudrow
)
. playing the same dumbed
- down role as she does in firends
, kudrow is amusing
,
but doesn ' t fit into this comedy mold as well as the director may have hoped
. the supporting cast sparkles
. joe viterelli is hilarious as jelly
, vitti ' s pea brained right
- hand man
,
and chazz palminteri is a sohw stopper palying a fellow mobster who ' s in desperate ened of the definition ofthe
` closure '
. the movie manages to maintain consistent chuckles througout
, putting the emphasis on 3 or 4 really big laughs that will have audiences grasping theri sides
. the situation is just too cute tothe resist
. it ' s unfortunate that thte language gets somewhat out of hand
.
bu hey
, if yuo ' re in the mafia
, using obscenities probably comes naturally
.
and near the end
, seeing billy crystal atempt to walk
and talk like a mob boss isnt truley a special treat
.
