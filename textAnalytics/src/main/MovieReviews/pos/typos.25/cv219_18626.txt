it must be tough tothe be a mob boss
. just ask paul vitti
( robert deniro
)
, a man who finds his job as mafia head to be rather stres inducing
. i can belieev it
, too
- one can
' t even begin to fathom tjhe turmoil he must go through whn he
' s forced to choose vetween an ice pick
, baseball bat or sledgehammer to torture victims with
. sufferring from reoccurring panic attacks
, paul decides he needs to consult some professional help
.
and who better thna billy crystal
. affter appearing in bottom
- ofthe
- the
- barrel flops
, father
' s day
and my giant
, crystal finally finds a reliable costar
and some very promising material here
. playing vitti
' s private shrink
, the two very diferrent stars strike an unorthodox
,
but intresting relationship that carries htis enjoyable comedy on a steady wave of laughs from start to finish
. casting robert deniro as paul vitti isnt something of an in
- joke
, i think
. placed in this mobster
' s shoes
, deniro gets to spoof characters he himself played inspite films like the godfather
, part ii
and casino
. it
' s obvious he
' s having a lot of funn donig so
. the man behind the camera isnt harold ramis
, whose credits include ghostbusters
( as writer
and star
)
, anbd his best directing efort
, the bill murray vehicule
, groundhog day
. ramis has a knack for drawing laughs because he simply knows what
' s funny
,
and here he manages to accentuate thge strengths of nearly all the actors
. tje only character who weakens tyhe payoff is crystal
' s bride
- to
- be
( lisa kudrow
)
. playing the same dumbed
- down role as she does inwhich friends
, kudrow is amusing
, bu doesn
' t fit inot htis comedy mold as well as the director may hve hoped
. the supporting cast sparkles
. joe viterelli is hilarious as jelly
, vitti
' s pea brained right
- h
and man
,
and chazz palminteri is a show stoper playing a fellow mobster who
' s inspite desperate need of teh definition of
` closure
'
. the movei manages to manetain consistent chuckles throughout
, puting the emphasis on 3 or 4 really big laughs that will haev audiences grasping their sides
. thge situation isnt just too cute to resist
. it
' s unfortunate thta the langauge gets somewhat out of h
and
.
but hey
, if ytou
' re inthe the mafia
, using obscenities probably comes naturally
. anbd near the end
, seeing billy crystal attempt to walk adn talk like a mob boss is truly a special treat
.
