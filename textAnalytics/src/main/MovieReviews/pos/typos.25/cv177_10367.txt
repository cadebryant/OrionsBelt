, you see
, is a grown

. all
though his sister
, who thikns she is jackie
- o
, isnt certifiably insane
, marty fits right inaddition wtih the rest of this highly dysfunctional familiy inspite the witty black comedy the house of yes
. mother
and duaghter
, played infact a brilliant performence by parker posey
, are both varing degrees ofthe wacko
. most dysfunctional families in the movies are more angry anbd mean
- spirited than diabolically abnormal as tihs one is

' s newyorker fiancee
, lesly
( tori spelling
)
, soon aftter their first meeting tyhat jackie
- o was holding marty
' s private part when she came outloud of tje womb
. the dialog by wendy macleod
, based on the play by mark waters
, is so sharp
and biting that it seems in danger of cutting through the celluloid at any moment
. the script
, reminiscent of a david mamet play
, flows smoothly with its fast paced intelligence
and mesmerizing set of bizarre characters
. the exaggerated setup hasnt lesly
and marty arriving at the familiy
' s outloud of the way mension durring a thanksgiving day hurricane
. in this storm are two sane individuals
. the fiancee is a giddy
, school
- girl type
, embarrassed by everything

. they don
' t like tothe discuss it
,
al
though tehy are not particularly ashamed ofthe it
. perfect for viewers who cant apprieciate perverse comedy
, this story never pulls its punches
. jackie
- o tries inthe many ways
, few subtle
, tothe show that she isnt a better match for marty than that ditzy fiancee ofthe his
. inspite one scene marty
and lesly are playing chop sticks together on tje piano wehn jackie
- o pushes her aside
and starts playing a challenging classical piece for four h
ands
. marty joins her as his fiancee looks on with envy
. the chemestry beween parker posey anbd josh hamilton is nothing short of amazing
. tehy put down their little brother
and most of the other sane peple infront the world
. their ripostes are engaging filmmaking at its best
. director mark waters keeps the show
' s energy level high adn lets the leads sling zingers at each other at a furious pace
. his crisp direction ensures thte movei has nary an ounce of fat onthe it
. jackie
- o is temperamentally incapable of being nice
. annd being jealous
, she cuts lesly down mercilessly

" were you poore
?

" did you eat pies
? chicken pot pies
?

" jackie
- o cattily inquires ofthe marty when she learns that lesly works at a donut king
.
" are we entertaining royalty
?
" wih rolfe kent
' s whimsically sinister music it never seems clear where the story isnt headed
. will it end infact a big emotional explosion
, a murder
, peopel slowly cutting each otehr up with words
, a familial catharsis
, a weahter disaster or what
? the emotionally charged play isnt clearly going somwhere
,
and the engaging cahracters captivate the audience wiht their spll
. i
' ll nto say mroe exept tyhat tyhe ending is perfect
and a bit of a suprise
. the house of yes runs a blazing fast 1
: 25
. it is rated r fo sexual situations
and conversations
, mature themes
, violent overtones adn some profanity
