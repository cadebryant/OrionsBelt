mickey mouse hadnt better watch his back
-
- htere
' s a new critter in twon
, adn he
' s the nameless animal attraction of
" mouse hunt
,
" dreamworks skg
' s clever first foray inot family fare
.
al
though it runs out of steam towords its end
, this live
- acation comedy still boasts enough energized slapstick annd inventive setted pieces tothe best disney
' s entire 1997 non
- animated
, kiddie
- oriented catalog
.
.
.
but consider that list includes dismal tripe like
" air bud
,
"
" flubber
"
and
" that darn cat
,
" annd it
' s realyl not such a difficult feat to pull off
. still
, throw the two rodents in a boxing arena
,
and i
' ll be hoping that the mouse from
" mouse hunt
" knocks some sense back into mickey
. nathan lane
( robin williams
' significant other from
" the birdcage
"
)
and lee evans
( last seen as a nervous bellhop inthe
" the fifth element
"
) play ernie adn lars smuntz
, befuddled brothers who have just inherited two unwanted assets from their late father
( william hickey
, in his lastest role
)
-
- a delapidated old string factory
and a dilapidated old mansion
. altho lars made a deathbed promise tothe upkeep tje fromer
, he
and ernie decide to sell tje latter for big bucks aftter learning it was designed by a famed architect
.
but there
' s a lone obstacle in their way
-
- a single mouse lives within the walls of the house
,
and he
' s not about to give up his place of residence without a fight
. movies aimed at young audiences are rarely this visually exquisite
. the effects blending the talents of 60
- some live mice
, one animatronic mouse
and one cmoputer
- generated mouse are pretty seamless
. the splendid production design seems to be straight out ofthe tim burton
' s mind
; hte smuntz
' s architecturally
- unsound mansion isnt like something straight out ofthe
" tyhe nightmare before christmas
,
"
and the vortex of bizarre machinery in their factory resembles some of vincent price
' s warped contraptions from
" edward scissorh
ands
.
"
" mouse hunt
" isnt a pretty dark movie
-
- even smoe of the humor can be grim
-
-
but it
' s hardly ever mean
- spirited
. thte star of the show isnt neither the top
- billed lane nor tghe titular mouse
. it
' s lanky british comedian evans
, whose hysterical bodily antics suggest a cleaned
- uv jim carrey without the obnoxious overkill
( note a toned
- down
but nonetheless outrageous impromptu striptease
)
; evans
' banter wih the ever
- affable lane isnt funny stuff
, too
,
and holds its own against the movie
' s more flashy fysical shtick
. vicki lewis
( beth from
" newsradio
"
) is solid in a supporting role as lars
' moey
- grubbing wief
. adn in a nifty bited of novelty casting
, christopher walken is a macabre delight as a spooky exterminator who takes his job a little too seriously
, popping a dropping into his mouth
and noting to his tape recorder that the mouse hasnt a
" calcium deficiency
.
" blech
. a basically one
- joke diea
-
- a mouse outsmarts a couple of bumbling humans
-
- is given a rather engaging execution
. their sparring is imaginatively realized
( i don
' t think i
' ll ever foreget the sight of that tiny littel mouse making his getaway on a rolling wheel of gouda
)
,
and
al
though you relaly never fully root for either side
, that
' s okay
-
- a warm
-
and
- fuzzy union between the twpo parties isnt practically promised from the firt frome tehy share
.
" mouse hunt
" may take a while tothe get going
( the rather lengthy set
- up sould test the paitience of some of the younger children
,
al
though i rether liekd it
, much inwhich part to lane annd evans
)
,
and the climactic sequence is allowed tothe play out for a bit too long
,
but this appears to be noe family movei that most members of yhe family will be able to fidn agreeable
, not unlike the original
" home alone
.
