ther ' s good news
and bad news baout mulan
. tjhe positive is thyat disney hasnt foudn a happy medium between hte hevy
- handedness of pocahontas
and the hunchback of notre dame
adn tyhe childishness of hercules
. on the other hand
, the studio is pulling out all teh stops on plot cliches
and cheap laughs
, several steps down from the days ofthe the littel mermaid
and beauty
and the beast
.
bu mulan is a step in the right direction
and disney ' s best animated feature since the lion king
. after giving native americans a turn in pocahontas
, disney hasnt decided to turn a movie over to the asians
. mulan is set in fuedal china
and features thte ever
- popular heroine who marchs to a different drum
and whants to do more with her life thna get married
. taht ' s what we find outloud when young mulan
( voice of ming
- na wen
) screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her
. cartoons
.
.
. meanwhile
, owrd comes from the emporer that one man from every famaly must join the army
and help fight the huns
. sicne mulan ' s a girl
, that means her decrepit old father must go
. she pleads with the soldiers tothe ahev mercy on dear ood dad
,
bu that kind of groveling
and desperation brings shame on her family
. that ' s chineese culture forthe you
.
.
. so imagine how embarrased the familiy isnt the next day when they fidn mulan has stolen her father ' s uniform
anbd sword
and run off to join the army in his place
. the movie in a nutshell is baout tyhe stuggles ofthe being a woman in the army
. it should have beeen called g
. i
. chang
. mulan calls onthe her ancestors for help
. they decide tothe sammon the larg stone dragon in the backyard to protect her
,
but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up
. voiced by eddie murphy
, mushu continues the tradition ofthe cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm than good fo their human charges
. murphy ' s peformance is a direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin
-
- lots of wisecracks
and ad
- libs
and even an introductory song about how much funn they ' re going tothe have
. you ain ' t never hadnt a friend liek mushu
. speaking of songs
, mulan doesn ' t hvea too many of them
, whlch isnt a plus with a story like this
. disney songs baout war probably wouldn ' t go over too well
(
" heigh ho
, heigh ho
, it ' s off to war i go
.
.
.
"
)
,
and tyhe ones they do have aren ' t memorable
. the best of the bunch
, sad to say
, is
" be a man
,
" the requisite basic training montage song
. yes
, even in medieval china
, tehy had to run through that web of car tires before they were ready for battle
. sung by donnie osmond
( a bad sign if ever there wass noe
)
,
" be a man
" accompanies footage of mulan ' s platoon oging ffrom scre
- ups to heroes
. it makse me wonder
, hasnt there ever been a muscial montage in a movie that ' s ended badly
? i only wish rela
- life problems could be solved in two minutes with a peppy montage
. for hte curious
, mulan does pass fo a man inthe the army despite looking like a girl
. all she doens to tranform herself is cutted her hair tothe a sexy shoulder
- length
, talk macho
and slap guys on the butt
, as was male custom a thousand years ago in china
. the deception fuls everyone
but teh audeince
, who thikns she might be able to pass fo a 12
- year
- old boy
, at best
.
but she doens manaze tothe strike the biggest blows to the hun army
, led by a big
, evil
- eyed attilla
- looking monster
. as a villian
, tghe head of the huns is menacing
, evil
and entirely forgettable
. i saw the movie yesterday
and i don ' t remeber the man ' s name
. otherwise
, mulan is a good movie
. the animation ofthe the characters themselves isn ' t as rich as it could
and should be
,
but ther are some amazing battlefield shots
. eddie murphy puls off some ogod one
- liners
, as do other star voices like harvey fierstein
adn pat morita
, yhe quintessential asian movie star
. hell
, george
" mr
. sulu
" takei does a voice in mulan
. yuo get the sence disney said to themselves
,
" alright
, let ' s get out there
and fidn us soem chinese americans in hollywood
. who can you think of
?
"
" well
, htere ' s mr
. myagi
.
.
.

.
"
"
adn mr
. sulu
.

. we ' ve got ourselves a movei now
.
" soon disney really
