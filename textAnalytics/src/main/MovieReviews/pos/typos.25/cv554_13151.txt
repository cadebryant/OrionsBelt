ther
' s good news adn bad news about mulan
. tghe positive is that disney hasnt found a hapyp medium beetwen the heavy
- h
andedness of pocahontas
and the hunchback ofthe notre dame
and the childishness of hercules
. onthe yhe other h
and
, the studio isnt pulling out all hte stops on plot cliches
and cheap laughs
, severeal steps down from the days of tjhe little mermaid adn beauty
and the byast
. bu mulan is a step in the right direction
and disney
' s best animated feature since the lion king
. after giving native americans a turn in pocahontas
, disney has decided to turn a movie over to the asians
. mulan isnt set in feudal china
and features the ever
- populer heroine who marches tothe a different drum
and wants to dont more with her life thna get married
. that
' s what we find outloud when young mulan
( voice of ming
- na wen
) screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her
. cartoons
.
.
. meanwhile
, word comes from thge emporer that one man fomr every family must join the army
and help fight the huns
. since mulan
' s a girl
, that means her decrepit old father must go
. she pleads with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old dad
,
but that kind of groveling
and desperation brings shame on her family
. that
' s chineese culture for ytou
.
.
. so imagine how embarrassed the family isnt the next day whn they find mulan has stolen her father
' s uniform
and sword
and run off to join the army in his place
. tje movie in a nutshell is about the stuggles of being a woman in hte army
. it should have been called g
. i
. chang
. mulan calls on her ancestors fo halp
. they decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her
,
but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up
. voiced by eddie murphy
, mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm tahn good for thier human charges
. murphy
' s performance isnt a direct descendent of robin williams infact aladdin
-
- lots ofthe wisecracks
and ad
- libs
and even an introductory song baout how much fun they
' re going to hve
. you ain
' t never had a freind like mushu
. speaking of songs
, mulan doesn
' t have too many of them
, which is a plus with a story liek tihs
. disney songs about war probably wouldn
' t go over too well
(
" heigh ho
, heigh ho
, it
' s off to war i go
.
.
.
"
)
, annd thge ones they do have aren
' t memorable
. the best of the bunch
, sad tothe say
, is
" be a man
,
" the requisite basic training montage song
. yes
, even in medieval china
, they had to run through tath web ofthe car tires befoer they were ready for battle
. sung by donnie osmond
( a bad sign if ever there was noe
)
,
" be a man
" accompanies footage of mulan
' s platoon going ffrom screw
- ups to heroes
. it makes me wonder
, has there ever been a musical montage in a movie that
' s ended badly
? i onyl wish rela
- life problems could be solved in twpo minutes wiht a peppy montage
. for the curious
, mulan does pass for a man in the army despite looking like a girl
. all she does to tranform herself is cut her hair tothe a sexy shoulder
- length
, talk macho annd slap guys onthe the
butt
, as was male custom a thous
and eyasr ago iin china
. the deception fools everyone
but the audience
, who thinks she might be able to pass for a 12
- yera
- old boy
, at best
.
but she does manage to strike the biggest blows to the hun army
, led by a big
, evil
- eyed attilla
- looking monster
. as a villain
, the head ofthe the huns is menacing
, evil
and entirely forgettable
. i saw tje movie yesterday adn i don
' t rember the man
' s name
. otherwise
, mulan is a good movie
. the animation ofthe the characters themselves isn
' t as rich as it could
and should be
, bu there are soem amazing battlefield shots
. eddie murphy pulls off some good oen
- liners
, as do otehr star voices like harvey fierstein
and pat morita
, the quintessential asian movie star
. hell
, george
" mr
. sulu
" takei doens a voice infact mulan

,
" alright

' s get out there
and find us soem chinese americans in hollywood
