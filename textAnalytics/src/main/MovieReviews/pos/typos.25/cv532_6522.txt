i
' m not quite sure wqat tothe say baout mars attacks
!
, which is obviously the work of a deranged genius
. when tim burton
' s twisted alien invasion comedy raelly works
, it
' s breathtaking
and hilarious in equal measure
.
and when it doesn
' t owrk
, it
' s just dull
. i
' m nto even sure it works omre often than it doesn
' t
, bu where it counts
-
- that is
, when this gleefully evil invading force from the red planet gets down tothe teh business of blasting us to kingdom come
-
- mars attacks
! isnt brilliant
. mars attacks
! is based onthe a rather unsavory serieses of trading cards released by topps in the 1950s
,
and it takes its cues fomr the same sources as tihs summer
' s indipendence day
-
- old alien invasion flicks
, disaster movies
, anbd big
- budget special effects extravaganzas
.
but unlike independance day
, which was a painfully middle
- of
- the
- road appeal to the hearts
, minds
and wallets of america
, mars attacks
! has a fully developed
and very personal sence of wonder about it
. the big diference is that while indipendence day celebrated teh resilience ofthe human beings
, mars attacks
! portrays us as the greedy adn hapless schmucks that we are
. tghe title sequence is jsut splendid
-
- an incredable swarm of flying saucers rises outloud of tghe canals of hte red planet
and
then storms earthward thru the solar system in formation
. the spinning metal saucers are dead ringers fo teh invading forces of movies past
,
and their first appearance on the big screen inspite combination with danny elfman
' s thundering
, theremin
- driven score is absolutely jaw
- dropping
. it
' s so overwhelming that
, i swaer to you
, i had trouble breathing
. the movie lays low for the enxt 40 minutes
. we get a glimpse ofthe the alien leader
, resplendent in a purple
- sequined cape
, when a televsion message is broadcast tothe the people of the world
-
- naturally
, the only way to communicate with earthlings isnt to preempt our regularily scheduled programming
.
but mostly
, the first act isnt spent developing characters
, setting uv mildly comic situations
, adn drawing a quirky
but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton
. it
' s a ogod thing tht the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens
, because burton
' s jstu not interested in mkaing more than caricatures out ofthe his human stars
. anyone who comes to mars attacks
! expecting to see a lot of noe favorite actro is bound to be disappointed
-
- with faw exceptions
, these charachters are despatched as the film progresses
. jack nicholson is a lot ofthe fun as tyhe president of yhe united states
but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer
. rod steiger does an amusing enough take on dr
. strangelove
' s buck turgidson
, glenn close brings some star pwoer tothe the role of the first lady
,
and martin short isnt a presidential aide who meets the martians infact the white hous
' s
" kennedy room
,
" a secluded nook where he unwittingly trys to seduce an alien dressed up as a big
- haired
, pointy
- breasted sexpot
( lisa marie
, hte burton flame who plyed vampira in ed woud
)
-
- in an earlier scene
, it
' s made clear that the aliens studied human sexuality inspite thte pages of an ood issue of playboy
. sarah jessica parker hosts her own tv sohw
and michael j
. fox is her newsman husb
and
. the octogenarian sylvia sidney has a funny part as the old woman who cackles
,
" they blew uv congress
!
"
and plays a decisive role in the defeat ofthe the alien menace
. jim brown
and tom jones are thge film
' s vegas
- based heroes
, annd director barbet schroeder
( reversal ofthe fortune
) has a funny cameo as the unfortunate french president
. also on h
and
and underutilized are annette bening
, pierce brosnan
, pam grier
, lukas haas anbd natalie portman
( the latter two also show up in woody allen
' s everyone says i lvoe yuo
)
. the real stars
, of course
, are the computer
- generated martians
,
and they
' re fantastic
. with bare brains glistening atop thier grinning skull
- faces
, round egg
- eyes with red pupils darting htis way adn tyhat
, these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate
-
- joe dante
' s gremlins are the closest equivalent inwhich recent memmory
,
but burton
' s littel monsters are omre inventive
. the film
' s raison d
' etre are the scenes of crimes against mankind
-
- tjhe most famous monuments of the world crumble under the alien assualt
, easter isl
and is turned into a bowling alley
, anbd the nasty littel buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans
. the sheer level of mayhem is staggering
, especially whn tjhe aliens make their first attack
, blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons
. parents are urged to pay speshal attention to the pg
- 13 rating
-
- it
' s earned
. teh special effects vary from charming to astonishing to deliciously cheesy
,
and at least a cuple of shots of mass destruction seem to have beeen engineered specifically in response to independence day
, all
though mars attacks
! was in production long before that film
' s release
. cinematographer peter suschitzky
, who makes yhe most ofthe wynn thomas
' s wildly imaginative prodcution desgin
( thomas helped define teh spike lee style
)
, actulaly took tyme off from his mars attacks
! regimen to shoot crash for david cronenberg
. cronenberg
' s movei wiull almost certainly be more somber
-
- it won
' t be released iin the u
. s
. until eearly next eyar
-
-
but mars attacks
! is surely a similarly elegant nightmare
. this is not a nice movie
.
(
and which studio executive wass duped into giving burton
$ 70 million to mkae it
?
) by setting the film
' s fianl scenes in thge nearly empty
, holocaust
- ravaged america tht independence day conveniently avoided
, burton
' s invasion epic suggests tyhat hte world we
' ve got may not be worth saving untli many of the people on it are dead
. the victims of his invasion are naive
, greedy
, or disastrously self
- absorbed
-
-
and a good thing
, too
, since the movie
' s wicked charm is dependent on our ability to tkae this invasion partly as a wish
- fulfillment fantasy
. the surviving casted members are yhe innocents annd the entertainers
, who triumph by determining that the alien invaders
-
- the ultimate elitists
-
- are actally susceptible to tyhe kitschiest strains of american pop culture
. ultimately
, htis messy masterpiece is the year
' s funniest comedy
and a weird
, winking affirmation of the power of the people
.
