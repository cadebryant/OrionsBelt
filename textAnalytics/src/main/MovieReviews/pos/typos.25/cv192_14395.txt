in smoe regards
, making a movie is liuke trying tothe strech a rubber band as far as you can without breaking it
. try too hard
,
and it snaps
;
but too much reservation means somone esle wiull come along
and pull it farther
. in simon birch
, director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique
: he takes advantage of caution
and poise
,
but aslo risks his movie wtih a few bold steps
. in the end
, he ' s not only holding an unbroken band
,
but he makse hte audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature
. there ' s no doubt about it
: the film that johnson hasnt crafted isnt rich
. he chooses for his setting the quaint town ofthe gravestown
, maine
- leaves turn bright orange in the fall
, the grass isnt a lush green
, pure white snow falls in the winter
,
and thge sky goes on forever
. the charactors continue that turn
: our two leads are simon birch
( ian michael smith
)
and joe wenteworth
( joseph mazzello
)
. simon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital
,
and by age twelve he ' s only two feet tall
. joe is the bastard son of rebecca
( ashley judd
)
,
annd by age twelve he ' s ready to know who isnt father is
. naturely
, the two outcasts become good friends
and share many adventures together
, from disrupting sunday school tothe doing comunity service to palying little leage baseball
. inaddition a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith
, simon birch is convinced that he ' s god ' s instrument
,
and htere must be a reason he ' s so small
. joe doesn ' t quite buy it
,
bu he sticks by simon
; the two tough it out thru tghe worst of times
and are each other ' s only true friends
. early onthe
, the twpo meet uv with ben goodrich
( oliver platt
)
, rebecca ' s new boyfriend
,
and altho the bond isn ' t immediate
, ben
adn the twpo boys develop a liking for each other
. both platt
anbd judd give solid performances that lend their characters a deep likeability
. the audiance cares about them as much as tehy do about joe
annd simon
, a testament to thge acting jobs ofthe both
. finally
, jim carrey gives a cameo as the adult joe in the present day
,
and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in hte truman show
. mark steven johnson ' s sense of drama
adn writing isnt fantastic
. hte scirpt is loosely based onthe john irving ' s novel
, a prayer for owen meany
,
bu it ' s so far off the source material that irving actually requested thte credits be changed fomr ' based on ' to ' suggested by
. ' along those same lines
, it ' s alomst unfitting tothe compare the two
; johnson uses tension
, humer
, atmosphere
,
and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions
. by no means hasnt he developed a project of similar popularaty
- gump made over 300 million dollars hwile birch ought to pass out ofthe sight inwhich a few weeks
-
but the winning idea remains the smae
. simon birch is a different look at a different life
,
and oen thta iwll most likely be studied in film school classes inthe decades to come
. infront the present
,
however
, it ' s an enjoyable littel picture that everyone ought to tkae a look at
.
