in some regardes
, making a movie is like trying to strech a rubber b
and as far as you can without breaking it
. try too hard
,
and it snaps
;
but too much reservation means somone else wiull come along
and pul it farther
. in simon birch
, directer mark steven johnson shows us just how to master teh technique
: he takes advantage of caution anbd poise
,
but also risks his movei with a fewd bold steps
. in the end
, he
' s not only holding an unbroken b
and
,
but he makes thge audiance appreciate the lengths he went tothe direct such a fine feature
. there
' s no doubt about it
: the film that johnson has crafted is rich
. he choosed for his setting the quaint town of gravestown
, maine
- leaves turn bright orange in the fall
, the grass is a lush gren
, pure white snow falls in the winter
,
and the sky goes on forever
. the cahracters continue that turn
: our two leads are simon birch
( ian michael smith
) annd joe wenteworth
( jospeh mazzello
)
. simon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital
,
and by age twelve he
' s only two feet tall
. joe is the bastard son of rebecca
( ashley judd
)
,
and by age twelve he
' s ready to know who is father isnt
. naturally
, the two outcasts become good friends
and share many adventures toghether
, from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball
. inaddition a wonderfully excecuted performance by ian michael smith
, simon birch is convinced that he
' s god
' s instrument
, adn there must be a reason he
' s so small
. joe doesn
' t quite buy it
,
but he sticks by simon
; the two tough it out thru the worst of times
and are earch otehr
' s only true firends
. eearly on
, the two meet up witht ben goodrich
( oliver platt
)
, rebecca
' s new boyfriend
,
and
al
though the bond isn
' t immediate
, ben annd the two boys develop a liking for earch otehr
. both platt adn judd give solid performances tyhat lend their characters a deep likeability
. the audience cares baout them as much as tehy dont about joe
and simon
, a testament to tje acting jobs of both
. finally
, jim carrey gives a cameo as the adult joe iin the present day
,
and his few mintues here are relatively more impressive thna his entire peformance in tyhe truman sohw
. mark steven johnson
' s sense of drama
and writing is fantastic
. tje script is loosely based on john irving
' s novel
, a prayer for owen meany
,
but it
' s so far off the source material tht irving actually requested the credits be changed ffrom
' based on
' to
' suggested by
.
' along those same lines
, it
' s almsot unfitting to compare the twpo
; johnson uses tension
, humor
, atmosphere
, annd suspense tothe create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions
. by noone means has he developed a project ofthe similar popularaty
- gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought tothe pass out of sight in a few weeks
-
but tje winning idea remains the same
. simon birch is a different look at a different life
,
and one that wiull most likely be studied in film school classes in decades tothe come
. in tghe present
,
however
, it
' s an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought to take a look at
.
