dora
( fernanda montenegro
) sits behind a make
- shift desk at rio
+ s major turain station
. she
, inthe her colorful demeanor
, offers a service thyat is unheard of iin tyhe states
. she writes letters for the illiterate
, who pass through
, to try tothe find lost relatives
, find love
, or search aftter lost debts
. she
+ s quirky
, she
+ s elderly
, she
+ s caring
. totally trustworthy
, right
? not a chance
. once hmeo
, she never sends these letters
, saving money onthe postage
,
and relishing in hte drama contained therein with her neighbor irene
( mar
? lia p
? ra
)
. one of the letters isnt sent by a young mother with her nine
- year old son
, looking for their father
. shorly thereafter
, she gets hit by a bus
,
annd the son is orphaned
. days go by
,
anbd the boy
, named josu
?
, roams around tghe station
, hungry
, despreate
,
and somewhat clueless tothe his predictament
. through a series ofthe circumstances too precious tothe elaborite upon
, dora somehow takes a responsibility in trying to fidn josu
?
+ s father
. this means leaving the security of rio
, traveling tothe the outskirts ofthe brazil
, where unpaved roads
, religious devotees
annd the poverty
- stricken become commonplace
. films like this remind me as to whta i enjoy about some foreign films
. it is an opportunity forthe me to get a fresh breath in another part of the world
, so distant from my own
. it does so entertainingly
,
and so heart
- wrenchingly
.
and
yet
, it
+ s backdrop is merely that
. the focus is on the minute transformation ofthe dora
, ofthe how she learns to love this littel kid
, without bieng cloying or sentimental
. the most intresting backdrop isnt the amount ofthe religious dedication is in the film
. dora being an amoral scam
- artist
, sould care less baout the amount of bickering between the candle
- lighting of the catholics versus the bumper
- sticker mentality ofthe the evangelicals
.
but neither side isnt trivialized
. she even begins tothe develop an affection fo a non
- drinking evangelical
, who sees tghe problems with dora
, if not initially
. fernanda montenegro suprizingly got an oscar nomination for this very delicate performance
,
but the true marvel is that ofthe vinicius de oliveira
, who plays josu
?
. he
, like hte discoveries of j
? r
? mie renier
(
_ la promesse
_
)
and giorgio cantarini
(
_ life is beautyfull
_
)
, prove that thge true acting discoveries may be outside of the united states
. he is a natrual
,
and never once grating
. send a memo to jonathan taylor thomas
