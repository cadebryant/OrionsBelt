dora
( fern
anda montenegro
) sits behind a make
- shift desk at rio
+ s major train station
. she
, in her colorful demeanor
, offers a service that is unheard ofthe infront the states
. she writes letters for tyhe illiterate
, who pass through
, to try to find lost relatives
, find love
, or search after lost debts
. she
+ s quirky
, she
+ s elderly
, she
+ s caring
. totally trustworthy
, right
? not a chance
. once hmeo
, she never sends these letters
, saving money on postage
,
and relishing in thte drama contained therein with her neighbor irene
( mar
? lia p
? ra
)
. one of the letters is sent by a young mother with her nine
- year old son
, looking for theri father
. shortly thereafter
, she gets hit by a bus
,
and the son is orphaned
. days go by
,
and the boy
, named josu
?
, roams around the staion
, hungry
, desperat
,
and somewhat clueless to his predictament
. through a series of circumstances too precious to elaborate apon
, dora somehow takes a responsibility in trying tothe find josu
?
+ s father
. this means leaving the security ofthe rio
, traveling to the outskirts of brazil
, where unpaved roads
, religious devotees
and the poverty
- stricken become commonplace
. films liek this remind me as to what i enjoy about some foregn films
. it is an opportunity for me tothe get a fresh breath in another part of hte world
, so distant from my own
. it does so entertainingly
, anbd so heart
- wrenchingly
.
and
yet
, it
+ s backdrop is merely that
. the focus is on the minute transformation of dora
, ofthe how she learns tothe love htis littel kid
, without bieng cloying or sentimental
. tghe most intresting backdrop is the amount of religious dedication is in the film
. dora being an amoral scam
- artist
, could care less about the amount ofthe bickering between the c
andle
- lighting of the catholics versus the bumper
- sticker mentality of the evangelicals
.
but neither side isnt trivialized
. she even begins to develop an affection for a non
- drinking evangelical
, who sees the problems with dora
, if not initialy
. fern
anda montenegro surprisingly got an oscar nomination for this vrey delicate performance
,
but tghe true marvel isnt taht of vinicius de oliveira
, who plays josu
?
. he
, like the discoveries of j
? r
? mie renier
(
_ la promesse
_
) adn giorgio cantarini
(
_ life is beautifull
_
)
, prove that the true acting discoveries may be outside of tghe united states
. he is a natrual
, anbd never once grating
