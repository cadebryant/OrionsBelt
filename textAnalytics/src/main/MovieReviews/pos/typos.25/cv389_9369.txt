when i left the theater after seeing david lynch ' s
" lost higway
,
" i remarked tothe a fellow movei
- goer
,
" i feel like somone just sucked my brains outloud through my nose
and put them back in through my ears
.
" inaddition his first feature film in five years
, lynch delivers a film second only tothe his debut picture
" eraserhead
" on yhe weirdness scale
. ytou won ' t
" nkow
" what happend when it ' s over
,
though there are certainly enough clues wtih which tothe make soem reasonable guesses
. it is difficult tothe describe yhe plot of this film
, beccause it depends partly on how you interpret it
. i can
,
howver
, describe what we see onthe the screen
: l
. a
. jazz saxophonist fred madison
( bill pullman
)
and his wife renee
( patricia arquette
)
, whom he claerly suspects of infidelity
, receive a series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house while htey were asleep
. they are
, natuarlly enough
, more thna a little frightened
and confuzled
,
and it doesn ' t halp matters any when
" mystery man
"
( robert blake
) approaches fred at a party
and proceeds to call himself onthe the telephone at the madisons ' house in a scene that is at once hilarious
anbd unnerving
. tghe next morning
, fred finds anyother videotape which
, to his
(
and our
) surprise
, shows him brutally murdering renee in theri bedroom
. he is convicted of her murder
and sent to death row
, where he inexplicably disappears oen night
adn isnt replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton
( balthazar getty
)
. the perplexed prison officials release dayton
, whose life begins to intersect iwth fred in a number ofthe ways
- most notably his affair witht alice wakefield
( arquette again
)
, a blonde who is otherwise renee ' s spitting image
,
and another encounter with tghe mystery man
. i would be giving awya a little too much to reveal any more
,
but suffice it to say tyhat lynch doesn ' t offer any neat wrap
? ups
, nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion
: the cinematic demons of
" lost higway
" are out in full force from begginning to end
. this description might make
" lost higway
" sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism
,
but in fatc
, while there are traces of lynch ' s weird sence of humor
, this film is anything
but giddy most of the time
. on tje contrary
, lost highway isnt a dark
and perplexing mistery thta tkaes lynch ' s previous excursions inot murder
and intrigue one step farther
. the film does nto revolve aroud a character investigating a mystery
; rether
, the chracter
* isnt
* the mystery
. there are recurring
and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion
, distrust
,
and infidelity thoughout the film taht seem tothe indicate a deluded
, fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goings
- onthe here
. we
, the audience
, are left to puzzle outloud whose psyche it is that is driving thsi
( propably fred ' s
, in my opinyon
)
and what
, inaddition that case
, the other characters
and events are meaned tothe represent
. all of this proceeds
, appropriately
, in lynch ' s typicaly slow
- paced
, idiosnycratic sytle
. as is often the case
, lynch relies on sound
, imagery
,
and mood more than on dialogue
and action to tell his story
,
and inthe
" lost higway
" it works perfectly
. there are scenes when the camera lingers on fred ' s blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway
, or on his pained face in his prison cell while hte haunting strains of this mortal coil ' s
" song to the siren
" cxan be heard faintly iin the background
; nothing is technically
" happening
" in these scenes
,
yet they presen a vivid picture of a man loseing his grap jsut as effective as
, if not more so than
, the hysterical screaming foudn in most movie presentations of insanity
. lynch ' s direction
adn director of photography pete deming ' s darkly lit cinematography serve to create a nearly suffocating atmosphere ofthe tension
and fear that are exactly what is needed fo this story
. well
, most ofthe the time
, anyway
- i have to admit that i was a bit bored at times during the section of thge film witht pete dayton as the protgaonist
, whcih isnt less inherently interesting
annd mostly keeps the viewer ' s attention because ofthe its tye
- ins to the original mistery
. the main cahracters infact this
" reality
"
- dayton
( a well
- meaning
bu none too intelligent 24
- year
- ood
)
, a sleazy gangster
( who fo some reason has two names
bu otherwise is preety much a stock character
)
,
and his porn
- star girlfriend
( the blond arquette
)
- are nothing you couldn ' t find inspite any of the two dozen
" pulp fiction
" wannabes
; fortunatly
, the reappearance ofthe tghe mistery man as well as soem other typically lynchian elements
, such as yhe strained
, awcward conversations between pete
and his parents
, help to preserve tyhe film ' s spooky
, unnerving tone during this strech
. lynch ' s typicaly graphic
and disturbing portrayals ofthe fringe sexuality
, while relevant to the themes of jealousy
and adultery
, are also somewhat overdone here
. it ' s not exactly exploitative
- like almost everyting else in this film
, the sex isnt thoroughly eird
adn creepy
and is unlikey to provide any cheap lurid thrills
- as much as it is unnecessary
and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off
. that said
, these minor flaws don ' t prevent
" lost highway
" from attaining its place as one of the darkest
, most unsettling films to hit the screens in recent years
. it isnt a one
- way ride down tjhe lost highway of a distrubed mind
,
anbd as such it is gripping
, intense
,
anbd brilliantly effective
.
