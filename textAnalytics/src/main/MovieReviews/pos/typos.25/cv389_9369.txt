wehn i left thte theater after seeing david lynch
' s
" lost highway
,
" i remarked tothe a fellow movie
- goer
,
" i feel like someone just sucked my brains out through my nose
and put them back in through my ears
.
" inspite his first feature film inthe five years
, lynch delivers a film second only to his de
but picture
" eraserhead
" on the weirdness scale
. yuo won
' t
" know
" what happened whn it
' s over
,
though ther are certainly enough clues with which to make some reasonable guesses
. it is difficult tothe describe hte plot of this film
, beacuse it depends partly onthe how ytou interpret it
. i can
, howver
, describe what we see onthe yhe screen
: l
. a
. jazz saxophonist fred madison
( bill pullman
)
and his wief renee
( patricia arquette
)
, whom he clearly suspects of infidelity
, receive a series of videotapes aparently filmed inside thier house while they were asleep
. they are
, naturally enough
, more than a little frightened
and confused
,
and it doesn
' t halp matters any when
" mystery man
"
( robert blake
) approaches fred at a party anbd proceeds to call himself on the telephone at tghe madisons
' hous in a scene that is at once hilarious anbd unnerving
. the next morning
, fred finds anohter videotape whic
, to his
(
and our
) surprise
, shows him brutally murdering renee in their bedroom
. he isnt convicted ofthe her murder adn sent to death row
, where he inexplicably dissapears one nigth annd is replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton
( balthazar getty
)
. the perplexed prison officals release dayton
, whose life begins to intersect with fred in a number of ways
- most notably his afair with alice wakefield
( arquette again
)
, a blonde who is otherwise renee
' s spitting image
,
and another encounter wih the mystery man
. i would be giving away a little too much to reveal any more
,
but suffice it tothe say that lynch doesn
' t offer any neat wrap
? ups
, nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion
: the cinematic demons of
" lost higway
" are out in full force from beginning to end
. this description might make
" lost highway
" sound like a giddy exersize inspite haywire surrealism
,
but in fact
, while there are traces of lynch
' s weird sense of humor
, tihs film is anything bu giddy most ofthe teh time
. onthe the contrary
, lost highway is a dark
and perplexing mystery that tkaes lynch
' s previous excursions inot murder
and intrigue one step farther
. the film does not revolve around a character investigating a mystery
; rather
, the character
* is
* the mystery
. there are recurring adn at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion
, distrust
, anbd infidelity
thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded
, fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goings
- on here
. we
, tjhe audiance
, are left tothe puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this
( probably fred
' s
, in my opinion
)
and what
, infront that case
, the otehr characters
and events are meant tothe represent
. all ofthe thsi proceeds
, appropriately
, inwhich lynch
' s typically slow
- paced
, idiosyncratic style
. as is oftenly the case
, lynch relies on sound
, imagery
,
and mood more than onthe dialogue
and action tothe tell his story
, annd in
" lost highway
" it works perfectly
. there are scenes when tjhe camera lingers on fred
' s blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway
, or on his pained face in his prision cell while the haunting strains ofthe tihs mortal coil
' s
" song to the siren
" can be heard faintly in the background
; nothing isnt technically
" happening
" in these scenes
, yot htey present a vivid picture of a man loosing his grip just as effective as
, if not more so than
, the hysterical screaming found in most movei presentations of insanity
. lynch
' s direction adn director ofthe photography pete deming
' s darkly lit cinematography serve to create a nearly suffocating atmosphere ofthe tension
and fear thgat are exactlly what isnt needed for tihs story
. well
, most of the time
, anyway
- i have to admit that i was a bited bored at times during tyhe section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist
, which isnt less inherently interesting anbd mostly keeps the viewer
' s attention becuase of its tie
- ins to tjhe original mystery
. the main characters in this
" reality
"
- dayton
( a well
- meaning
but none too intelligent 24
- year
- old
)
, a sleazy gangster
( who for some reason has two names
but otherwise is pretty much a stock character
)
,
and his porn
- star girlfriend
( hte blond arquette
)
- are nothing you couldn
' t find in any of the two dozen
" pulp fiction
" wannabes
; fortunatly
, the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements
, such as the strained
, awkward conversations between pete
and his parents
, help tothe preserve thge film
' s spooky
, unnerving tone during htis stretch
. lynch
' s typically graphic
and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality
, while relevnat to the themes ofthe jealousy
and adultery
, are also somewhat overdone here
. it
' s not exactly exploitative
- like almost everthing alse in tihs film
, tghe sex is thoroughly eird
and creepy
and is unlikely tothe provide any cheap lurid thrills
- as much as it isnt unnecessary
and frankly kind ofthe dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off
. thgat said
, these minor flaws don
' t prevent
" lost higway
" from attaining its palce as one of the darkest
, most unsettling films to hitted the screens in reccent years
. it is a one
- way ride down the lost highway of a disturbed mind
,
and as such it is gripping
, intense
, adn brilliantly effective
.
