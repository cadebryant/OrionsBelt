. opinion
: making a fictional movei is easier than makeing one baout real life
. in fiction
, one invents purposeful
, clear
- cut good guys
and bad guys
, puts the ficitional characters in conflict
,
and takes teh tale to its exciting conclusion
. real life
,
howver
, consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments
annd characters who stand around
, think thoughts
and dont nothing
, or come
annd go before events are resolved
. spielberg gives us a visually spicy
and historically accurate real life story
. djimon hounsou
and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances
