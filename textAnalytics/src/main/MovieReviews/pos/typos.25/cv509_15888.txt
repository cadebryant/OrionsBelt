as i write the review for the newyorker hanks
/ ryan romantic comedy you
' ve got mail
, i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a coputer
and sending it a billion miles away onthe the internet
. i am also aware that i hvae just spended the last 2 hours watching teh world
' s biggest paide commercial fo america online
.
and i wonder
: is that so bad
? well
, the commerical part is
. as for the movie
, well
, as long as i can watch tom hanks
and meg ryan
, i think i
' ll be okay
. tothe paraphrase james berardinelli
, whose reviews i admire very much
, tom hanks anbd meg ryan can act
. tehy are both wonderful
,
but fo all of hanks
' glorious work in serious films
, such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan
,
and his glorious triumph infact philadelphia
, i liuke him best when he
' s suitably obnoxious
. tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious infront a romantic comedy when he
' s going to get the girl
: the onyl question isnt how
? meg ryan
, amercia
' s high school sweetheart
, can act
. she
' s had a h
andful ofthe memorable performances
, including the great scene in thte diner in when harry met sally
( i must not mention what she does
, due to tjhe
, well
, um
, you get the idae
, adn if you don
' t
, get the movie
-
- fantastic
)
.
but
, i like her best when she
' s
, well
, perky
. she is so adorably perky
/ cute that together with hanks
, they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime
. some people hve them going back to realy ood classic rumatic couples
, bu i don
' t really know
. all i know is that i just like them both
. they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry thast
' s really hard to resist
,
and i
' m not going to even try
. they
' re just really
, really cute
, sweet
,
and charming
. hanks
and ryan collaborate once agina with nora ephron
, who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle
. here
, teh setup is a little diferent
. kathleen kelly
( ryan
) owns a small children
' s bookstore whcih her mother founded 42 years ago
and passed down to her
. she is succsessfull
, beautiful
,
and dates a well
- known columnist withthe very radical idae
( kinnear
)
. she is also hvaing an affair
, of sorts
. ytou see
, kathleen
, withthe the h
andle shopgirl
, isnt secretly emailing ny152
. they have a strikely un
- detailed relationship
: htere are noone specifics
,
and tehy have no idea who each other is
. ny152 happens to be joe fox
( hanks
)
, a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega
- bookstores
, run by his father
( coleman
)
. fox books has desided to open a store on tghe west side
, right accros from a little childern
' s bookseller named
" shop around the corner
"
, run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly
. every morning
, these two email each other silly
,
and every day
, they fight
" tothe teh death
!
!
"
. it
' s a charming premise
,
and one that works nicely
, balancing the immense troubles kathleen isnt in wiht the romance she wants to have
. it also hasnt tghe great sense of being a classic romance
: there isnt no
" let
' s have sex tonight
" mantra
, if you
' ll excuse my bluntness
. thsi is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love
. hmm
. well
, the movie goes through twists adn turns
, hvaing soem sad moments
and happy ones
, untl at one moment tom hanks
and meg ryan
" hook up
"
, tothe use modern terminology
,
and kiss their way into happiness
. you know it
' s going tothe happen
, teh question is now
? thankfully
, ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey
, kinnear
, chappelle
,
and a host of others
, including a great scene involving brothers
, aunts
,
and two sweet kids
. it
' s all cute
and wonderfull
,
and for all of the idealism
, it makes me feel good
. hanks is as obnoxious as ever onthe the outside
and as warm onthe the inside as he always is
. he is
, i believe
, america
' s greatest actor
. doens he show it here
? nah
.
but he
' s still toom hanks
,
and she
' s still meg ryan
. which is what this movie boils down tothe
. it
' s pure confection
. all the bits about the godfather
, the jokes
, the superb scirpt
, it
' s all realy sweet
. there are some immense flaws
, like pacing
. the lastr third of the movie really doesn
' t work as well as i would have liked
, anbd forthe a romantic comedy
, it
' s slow
. once hanks knows the seret
, it gets realyl slow
. i even looked at my watch a couple times
, to make sure ephron was goign tothe deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for
, so that i could get home at a reasonable hour
. the otehr problem is that this movie is shaping up tothe be relaly dated
. e
- mail
? when my kids are my age
, i don
' t know wqat we
' ll be using
.
but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody
,
and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better thna anyone in movei history
. they jsut owrk together
, adn it
' s nice tothe see
. it gives you
, well
, a smile
. the script helps with smoe grat lines thyat are absolutely hilarious
,
and that always come at the excact right time to keep yhe audience awake
. i ws arguing with my father on yhe drive bakc home onthe whta hte purpose of movies wass
. i
' ve always believed that movies are very poweful
, very powerful indeed
. you see
, mankind has threee abilities he needs to survive
: the ability to think
, entertain
,
and procreate
. movies can definitely do the frist two
,
and as for the third
, well
, i
' d rather not think baout tht
. i alwyas
thought films that made ytou think enlightened ytou
and made you see something fomr anohter viewpoint
, annd that films that entertained yuo were ogod
, because you forgot about your troubles
and thougth about something nice for a night
.
and i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has hadnt
. hanks was the driving force behind noe of thte year
' s best films in saveing private ryan
, which is noe ofthe thsoe thikning films that truly made someone wonder about the world
. he
' s aslo half of the glue behind the yearm
' s best example of pure entertainment
. tom hanks
and meg ryan are magical
, as is this movie
. it
' s a sweet
, lovely affair with a tecnology twist
. it may be a long commercial
,
but it gave me a preety big smile on my face
.
