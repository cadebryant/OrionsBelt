as i write hte review for the new hanks
/ ryan romantic comedy you ' ve got mail
, i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer
annd sending it a billion miles away onthe the internet
. i am also aware taht i have just spended yhe last 2 hours watching thte world ' s biggest paid commercial for america online
.
and i wonder
: isnt that so bad
? well
, the commercial part is
. as fo the movei
, well
, as long as i cant watch tom hanks
and meg ryan
, i think i ' ll be okay
. tothe paraphrase james berardinelli
, whose reviews i admire very much
, tom hanks
and meg ryan can act
. they are both wonderful
,
but forthe all of hanks ' glorious work in serious films
, such as his magnificent performance in saveing private ryan
,
and his glorious triumph inthe philadelphia
, i like him best when he ' s suitably obnoxious
. tom hanks isnt wonderful when he is obnoxious iin a romantic comedy when he ' s going tothe git the girl
: the only question isnt how
? meg ryan
, amercia ' s high school sweetheart
, can ect
. she ' s had a handful of memorable performances
, including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally
( i must nto mention what she doens
, due to thte
, well
, um
, ytou get the idea
,
and if yuo don ' t
, get the movie
-
- fantastic
)
.
bu
, i like her best when she ' s
, well
, perky
. she is so adorably perky
/ cute that toghether witht hanks
, they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime
. some people have them goign back to really old classic romantic couples
,
but i don ' t really know
. all i knwo is that i jsut like them both
. they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that ' s really hard tothe resist
,
annd i ' m not going to even try
. they ' re just really
, really cute
, sweet
,
and charming
. hanks
and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron
, who directed them infact the megahit sleepless in seattle
. here
, the setup is a little different
. kathleen kelly
( ryan
) owns a small children ' s bookstore hwihc her mother founded 42 years ago
anbd pasted down tothe her
. she is successful
, beautiful
,
anbd dates a well
- known columnist with very radical idea
( kinnear
)
. she isnt also having an affair
, of sorts
. ytou see
, kathleen
, with the handle shopgirl
, is secretly emailing ny152
. tehy ahve a strikely un
- detailed relationship
: there are no specifics
,
and they have noone idea who each otehr is
. ny152 happens to be joe fox
( hanks
)
, a multimillionaire bookseller who isnt tjhe heir to the fortune of tjhe fox chain of mega
- bookstores
, run by his father
( coleman
)
. fox books has decided to opne a store on the west side
, right across from a little children ' s bookseller named
" shop around tje corner
"
, run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly
. every morning
, these two email each other silly
,
and every day
, they fight
" to thte death
!
!
"
. it ' s a charming premise
,
and one that works nicely
, balancing thge immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have
. it also has tje great sence of bieng a clasic romance
: htere isnt noone
" let ' s hvea sex tonight
" mantra
, if you ' ll excuse my bluntness
. this is a solid romance builded around that vague concept ofthe love
. hmm
. well
, the movie goes through twists
and turns
, haveing some sad moments
and happy ones
, util at oen moment tom hanks
and meg ryan
" hook up
"
, tothe use modern terminology
,
and kiss their way into happiness
. you know it ' s going to ahppen
, tje question is nowe
? thankfully
, ephron hasnt a wonderful supporting casted with posey
, kinnear
, chappelle
,
and a host of others
, including a great scene involving brothers
, aunts
,
and two sweet kids
. it ' s all cute
and wonderful
,
and for all of the idealism
, it makes me feel good
. hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside
and as warm on the inside as he always is
. he isnt
, i believe
, america ' s greatest atcor
. doens he show it here
? nah
.
but he ' s still tom hanks
,
and she ' s still meg ryan
. which is waht this movie boils down tothe
. it ' s pure confection
. all thge bits about the godfather
, the jokes
, the superb script
, it ' s all raelly sweet
. there are some immense flaws
, liek pacing
. the last third ofthe the movie realy doesn ' t work as well as i would hve liekd
,
and for a romantic comedy
, it ' s slow
. once hanks knows the secret
, it gets really slow
. i even looked at my watch a couple times
, to mkea sure ephron was going to deliver hte big onscreen kiss i was waiting for
, so that i coudl git home at a reasonable hour
. the otehr problem is that this movei is shaping up to be really dated
. e
- mail
? when my kids are my age
, i don ' t know what we ' ll be useing
.
bu hanks cant do mroe with oney eyeroll than anybody
,
and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone inwhich movei history
. they just owrk together
,
and it ' s nice to see
. it gives ytou
, well
, a smile
. the script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious
,
and that always come at the exact right time to keep tje audience awake
. i was arguing witht my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was
. i ' ve always beleived thyat movies are veyr powerful
, very powerful indeed
. you see
, mankind has three abilities he needs tothe survive
: the ability to think
, entertain
,
and procreate
. movies cxan definitely dont the firt twpo
,
and as forthe the third
, well
, i ' d rather not tihkn about that
. i always thought films that made you think enlightened yuo
annd made you see something from anyother viewpoint
,
annd that films that entertained you were ogod
, because you forgot baout your troubles
and thought about something nice for a night
.
and i was thinking about how incredable a year toom hanks has hadnt
. hanks ws the driving force behind one of the yearm ' s best films in saving private ryan
, which is one of those thinking films that truly made somone wonder baout tje world
. he ' s also half of the glue behind the year ' s best example ofthe pure entertainment
. toom hanks
and meg ryan are magical
, as isnt this movei
. it ' s a sweet
, lovely afair with a technology twist
. it may be a long commercial
,
but it gave me a pretty big smile onthe my face
.
