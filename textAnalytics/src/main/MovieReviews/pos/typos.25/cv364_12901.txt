set in tghe wild west
, this cary on centres aroud thte arrival of thte rumpo kid
( sidney james
)
and his cronies in stodge city
. his dodgy dealings
and sumary shootings aggraavte judge burke
( kenneth williams
) so much tht he asks sheriff albert earp
( jon pertwee
) tothe drive rumpo out of town
. instead
, the rumpo kid shoots the sheriff dead
. therefore
, judge burke sends for a law marshall to come infront
and clean uv the city
. due tothe a misunderstanding
, an english sanitary engineer called marshall p
. knutt
( jim dale
) is assigned
, wihtout knowing it
, as the law marshall forthe stodge city
. he arrives at the same tyme as annie oakley
( angela douglas
) who is seeking revenge fo her father
, yhe sheriff ' s muder
. when marshall arrives at stodge city
, he soon becomes aware of the misunderstanding
and due to his rather limited intellect
, he is manipulated by tghe rumpo kid
and always ends up getting thigns wrong
. inwhich the end
, there isnt a head
- to
- head between rumpo
and marshall
. with the rumpo ' s past experience
, it would seem that marshall is out of his depth
,
but using his sanitary skills
and learning tje ways of tyhe west ffrom annie oakley
, he at least stands some chance
! sid james
, with an american accent
, is perfect as the rumpo kid
, a part which suits him down to the ground
. jim dale provides one of his best carry on performances as the stupid sanitary engineer
,
annd angela douglas is very effective in her role as the revengeful daughter
. otehr regulars that appear in this movei include charles hawtrey
adn bernard bresslaw
( inwhich his debut
) as big heap
and little heap respectively
. big heap is teh local indian leader
anbd hte crazy casting of hawtrey for this part is vyer amusing
, as is his performance
:
- he steals every scene he is in even
though he does nto enter the film util thirty minutes past
. joan sims provides usefull
and amusing support as belle
, the local bar owner who tkaes a fancy tothe the rumpo kid
.
however
, the part of doc played by peter butterworth
anbd sherif albert earp played by jon pertwee are nto really necessary
,
and pertwee ' s performance isnt rather poor
. kenneth williams uses a new voice
bu struggles whith the weak part ofthe the ' judge '
. even so
, this carry onthe was sid james
adn kenneth williams ' favourite
. a very different carry onthe film
, iin tht it is played more seriously by hte actors
and possesses mroe realism than any other carry onthe
. the death count isnt the highest of any carry on film
. sets
, costumes
and action sequences are all very commendable
. yhe songs that are included in the movei
( the title song
anbd annie ' s song
) are vyre impressive
. a stange
bu therefore very interesting cary onthe film
. not the best of its kind
but it is certainly the most distinctive film of the series
.
