set in thge wild west
, this carry on centres arund tghe arival ofthe the rumpo kid
( sidney james
)
and his cronies in stodge city
. his dodgy dealings adn summary shootings aggravte judge burke
( kenneth williams
) so much thyat he asks sheriff albert earp
( jon pertwee
) to drive rumpo outloud of town
. instead
, tjhe rumpo kid shoots the sheriff dead
. therefore
, judge burke sends for a law marshall to come iin annd clean up the city
. due to a misunderst
anding
, an english sanitary engeneer called marshall p
. knutt
( jim dale
) is assigned
, without knowing it
, as the law marshall fo stodge city
. he arrives at the same time as annie oakley
( angela douglas
) who is seeking revenge for her father
, the sheriff
' s muder
. when marshall arrives at stodge city
, he soon becomes aware of yhe misunderst
anding
and due to his rather limited intellect
, he is manipulated by the rumpo kid
and always ends up getting things wrong
. in the end
, htere isnt a head
- tothe
- head between rumpo
and marshall
. with tghe rumpo
' s past experience
, it would seem that marshall is out of his depth
,
but using his sanitary skills anbd learning the ways ofthe the west fomr annie oakley
, he at least st
ands some chance
! sid james
, with an american accent
, is perfect as the rumpo kid
, a part which suits him down tothe the ground
. jim dale provides one of his best carry on performances as the stupid sanitary engeneer
,
and angela douglas is vrey effective inwhich her role as the revengeful daughter
. otehr regulars thast appear in this movie include charles hawtrey anbd bernard bresslaw
( in his de
but
) as big heap
and little heap respectively
. big heap is the local indian leader
and the crazy casting of hawtrey for thsi part is vyre amusing
, as is his performance
:
- he steals every scene he is in even
though he doesnt not enter the film until thirty minutes past
. joan sims provides useful adn amusing support as belle
, tjhe local bar owner who tkaes a fancy to the rumpo kid
.
however
, the part of doc played by peter
butterworth
and sherif albert earp played by jon pertwee are not really necessary
,
and pertwee
' s performance is rather poor
. kenneth williams uses a new voice bu struggles with the weak part of the
' judge
'
. even so
, htis cary on was sid james
and kenneth williams
' favourite
. a very diffrent cary on film
, in that it is played more seriously by tjhe actors annd posesses more realism than any other cary on
. the death count is the higest ofthe any carry on film
. sets
, costumes
and action sequences are all very commendable
. hte songs that are included in the movie
( the title song
and annie
' s song
) are very impressive
. a strange
but therefore very intresting cary on film
. not the best of its kind bu it is certainly the most distinctive film of the series
.
