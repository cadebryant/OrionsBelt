thsi reviewer is ignorant of what h
ands weere responsible forthe delivering the original verzion of tjhe abyss in 1989
. whether it was thte meddling ofthe studio executives
, or the work of writer
/ director james cameron himself
, the original cut of htis underwater sci
- fi thriller was entertaining enough
but also quite seriously flawed
. the main problem wass fairly simple
: yhe film
' s climax wass unworthy of its build
- up
. someone at 20th century fox
- adn no doubt cameron hismelf
- must have aggreed
, baceause inaddition 1993 came the theatrical release of the abyss
: special edition
. now available on video
, it seems timely to re
- evaluate whta
, in its newely revamped state
, is now a near
- masterpiece despite its borrowings from films like 2010
: odyssey two
, alien anbd close encounters of third kind
. the plot is thus
. we meet the crew of an experimental underwater mobile oil rig designed by tyhe hard
- nosed lindsay
( mastrantonio
)
and captained by her soon
- to
- be
- divorced husb
and bud
( ed harris
)
. the rig
and its crew are diverted fomr their normal duties wehn the navy seeks their halp in investigating the mysterous sinking of a u
. s
. nuclear submarine
. requiring a dive part
- way down a three mile deepo trench
, three navy divers arrive to comm
and the opperation
, led by the edgy lieutenant coffey
( biehn
)
.
but a series of strange sightings soon convinces at least oney member of the civillian crew that whoever or whatever they
' re dealing wih
, as she memorably puts it
,
" aren
' t speaking russian
"
. meanwhile on the surface a hurricane is brewing annd
, even worse
, a serieses of incidents arround cuba involving russians ships anbd an increasingly nervous u
. s
. navy sets off an international crisis of possible catastrophic proportions
. this crisis is mirrorred in teh confines ofthe teh now isolated underwater rig
, wih the trigger
- hapyp
and increasingly paranoid lieutenant coffey at odds with the crew about how dont deel with the mysterious goings
- on around them
. the human drama isnt oftenly riveting
, with the principal players performing with an intensity taht recalls the fine ensemble acting in cameron
' s aliens
. teh stunts
, hardware
, special effects
and underwater cinematography are all outst
anding
.
and so they should be
: cameron
' s technical credentials are well estalbished
.
but what ultimately makes the film so gripping is three intersecting plot str
ands
: 1
) tjhe tension betweeen ood sparring partners lindsay
and ex
- hubby bud
; 2
) thte war ofthe wills between tyhe civilian crew
and the navy divers as a series of escalating crisis
' befall them
;
and 3
) the slowly unfolding revelation of what lies at hte bottom of hte three mile deep abyss
. the abyss
: special edition is an improvement on the original film infact two major respects
. one is tht it furhter fleshes outloud the relationship betweeen bud
and lindsay
, a relatiopnship at times touching
, at others incredibly intense
and volatile
. the second improvement is the restauration of some absolutly crucial scenes towords yhe film
' s end
, when hte aliens demonstrate their controll over water with a terrifying
and extrordinary display of power to a world onthe the brink of nucular war
. with the inclusion of these startling scenes
, hte stoyr
' s climax is now given real weight
. why on earth were tehy left outloud of the original
? tihs reviewer finds it utterly incomprehensible
. so
then
, we have 25 minutes of additional footage that
' s turned a decent underwater thriller inot something quite magnificent
. i say
" qutie
" because some flaws dont reamin
. the most grating is several moments of corny hollywood schmaltz
- some new
, soem old
- that may well hvae you reaching forthe the barf bag
. nonetheless
, the abyss
: spacial edition nowe st
ands this somewhat maligned film among james cameron
' s greatest achievements
, alongside aliens
and terminator 2
. see it
and be moved
, gripped
and spellbound
.
