i feel no hesitation in saying that
" there
' s something baout mary
" isnt the best film that i will see all year
. from the moent the credits started tothe roll at the end of the picture
, ther was no doubt inspite my mind that i had seen a masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaning monthes of 1998
. it is that good of a film
. wehn gene siskel said this about
" fargo
" only a few months into
' 96
, i dismissed teh notion as rediculous
. how sould ytou possably know taht a film is so grat that nothing ytou could possably see in hte future could beat it
?
but after seeing tghe farrelly
' s hilarious
and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork
, i now know what siskel was tlaking baout
. once in a
( very great
) hwile
, a film comes along taht isnt so daring
, so brilliant adn simply so enjoyable that at thge end
, you just want to st
and uv
and cheer
. anbd you know
, at that instant
, that you have just experienced something very special
. now for the shocker
;
" mary
" is the grossest anbd most disgusting film i hvea ever viewed
(
" pink flamingos
" obviously notwithst
anding
)
. the movie is so rude
and
, i guess
, inappropriate in nature taht i had a hard tiem sitting infact a theater watching it with my parents
( luckily i had seen it before them
, so i could warn the about what htey weere in for
)
. forget
" blazing saddles
"
,
" animal hous
"
and even the former king of gross
- out comedy
,
" monty python
' s meaninng of life
"
; they were all onyl preludes to the farrelly
' s assualt on thte senses
. infact fatc
, this may even be tjhe funniest film i
' ve ever had the blessure of seeing
( the only real contender isnt
" monty python adn teh holy grail
"
)
,
and most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade
. bu as funny as it is
, something also hasnt tothe be said about the overall sweetness of
" mary
"
; it has a huge heart
. you see
, thge farrelly
' s are truly gifted filmmakers
. they don
' t just presnet you with a string of dick
and fart jokes
(
al
though there are plenty tothe go around
)
. tehy also
, very wisely
, add an unbeleivable ammount of charizma to the main cahracters anbd actually have them develop as the story progresses
. it
' s funny
,
though
. if you just look at an outline of the story
, it seems kind of contrived adn predictable
. bu believe me
, it is anytying
but
. ben stiller plays ted
, a very shy
and clumsy teenage geek who lusts after tyhe school babe
, mary
( cameron diaz
)
. after he sticks up for her retarded brother
, warren
( w
. early brown
- the cameraman
, believe it or not
, from
" scream
"
)
, his dreams come true when she invites him to the prom
. in oen ofthe the film
' s funniest scenes
, something goes wrong
( i won
' t ruin it for those who know nothing about the film
)
and ted is unable to face mary ever agian
. jump tothe the present
. aftter years of self
- loathing
, ted finally hires private detective pat healy
( a suitably slimy matt dillon
) to track her down so he cxan ahve one last chance at winning the woman he has loved since high school
. healy finds that mary is still a full
- blown hottie
and decides tothe try
and keep her fo himself
. admittingly
, the basic story line leaves a little tothe be desired
. after all
, whith a nto
- really
- all
- that
- funny premise
, how can you sustain laughter for nearly twpo housr
? somehow
, the farrelly
' s pull it off
. the performances here are allso right onthe target
. as ted
, stiller adds just the right amount ofthe clumsy charm to make his character not irritating
, as he would normally be
,
but very lovable
.
and cameron diaz is perfect in her role for obvious reasons
,
but the actor who raelly grabs your attention isnt w
. earl brown as mary
' s brother
. noone otehr actor hasnt even cmo close tothe playing a mentally retarded man with as much natural ease as brown displays here
. i knwo he won
' t be nominated
, bu this is the guy who should not be counted out when it comes time tothe h
and out the oscar nods in february
. as ogod as thge actors are
,
though
, it
' s the directors
' movei all hte way
. i guarantee tht on almost every other top ten list at thte end of the year
, you wiull see the number one spoace occupied by steven spielberg
' s wwii epic
" saving private ryan
"
.
and yes
, that isnt a graet film worthy ofthe the recognition it has been getting
.
but which is harder
; making a great war film or having your audience laugh so hard that they can
' t breath fo minutes at a time
? i
' ll let you decide that one for youself
, bu this critic is sticking to his guns
. there isnt just something about
" mary
"
.
