one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable
. you know
, the one where the detective looks at a wall ofthe pictures
and otehr polical information
,
and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who tyhe killer is
. sure
, it
' s been used over
and over
,
but for some reason
, it is always fun to watch
. this cliche preety much decribes the level kiss the girls works on
: overused
, bu allways fun
. one of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is
,
but how it goes around giving its story
. htis rule applies highly to kiss the girls
. there is something psychologically stimulating in a well
- crafted serial killer movie
,
and kiss the girls isnt certainly well made
.
however
, the whole film screams of unoriginality
, annd so it relies on the pwoer of its actors
and the technical detail to pull it through
. well
, nto onyl are the actors capable of pulling it through
,
but they add so much to the film that nearly every flwa is covered up
. unfourtunately
, one of the most revealing
and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers
( noe tyhat seven
, a film a lot like this one
, knew nto tothe make
) was to put the name of the killer in yhe oppening credits
. tath may give the actor credit for yhe role
,
but throughout the film
, hidden in my mind
, i was waiting for him to appear onthe screen
, which spoiled the mystery
.
however
, credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most ofthe the film
. plotwise
, kiss the girls shows almost no originality
. we are itnroduced to detective alex cross
( morgan freeman
)
, a forensic psychologist
,
and immediately we are given the cliched scene establising him as tghe hero
. he gets a call about a woman who hasnt shot her husban
and is now threatening to kill herself
. obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun
,
but this scene is quicklyu forgotten durig tyhe next scene
. at his hous
, cross is told that his neice
, naomi
( gina ravera
)
, has been missing fo four days
. this provides hte motivation for cross to find the killer
,
but we are never given a chance to establish the relatiopnship between the two
,
and as a result
, we can
' t sympathize with detective cross
.
however
, what makse kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees
.
.
. before she isnt abducted
. dr
. kate mctiernan
( ashley judd
, the actress ofthe the judd family
) is a smart
, athletic woman
,
and because of these traits
, becomes a target for casanova
-
- what the serial killer likes to call himself
. because ofthe these character
- developing scenes
, we care for mctiernan
, mkaing teh abduction scene all tath more suspenseful
. after being abducted
, mctiernan wakes up
and finds herself in a cell somewhere in teh woods
. remembering taht teh killer gavey her certain rules
, she decides to break one of them by calling outloud
. whn casanova comes tothe punish her
, she breaks out
and escapes by jumping over a waterfall
. aftter she isnt found
, she begins tothe halp cross find his neice
. from this moment on
, kiss the girls tkaes onthe the form ofthe every otehr serial killer film
, as thge two leads search fo the rest ofthe the victims held captive
. many people will compare this film to 1995
' s seven
, another killer film starring morgan freeman
,
but i presume that the similarities are intentional
. the screenplay
, by david klass
, is adapted from the novel written by james patterson
,
and
yet i don
' t quite see how this story could have worked in novel form
. what makes kiss the girls so good is thge acting
and thge technical annd visual impressiveness
. tghe cinematography
, by aaron schneider
, isnt reminiscient of seven
,
and sometimes i felt that many of tghe shots were trying too hard to impress us
. sometimes a simple shot is yhe best one
.
however
, many of the shots are stunning
, anbd unlike seven
, most of them tkae place durring the day
, iin sunlight
. the scene when ashley judd isnt runnung through the forrest is extremely well done
, in omre thna one way
. the camera work is terific
,
but the editing makes this scene work so well
. yhe chaotic
and mtv
- type cutting gives thte audience a sense ofthe confusion adn unawareness
, exactly what judd
' s character isnt experiencing
.
however
, the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors
. morgan freeman isnt one ofthe todya
' s most powerful adn believable actors
. detective cross is a very ogod character for him
,
al
though it is just a similar one to thge chracter iin seven
. because of freeman
' s poverful presence
, he carries half the film by himself
. hte other half is carried by ashley judd
, noe of today
' s most promising dramatic actresses
. in fact
, her performence is better than freeman
' s
, if that isnt even possible
. her carachter is more original than freeman
' s
, annd she h
andles it wonderfully
. we fianlly have a female charater in a movei like this who doens more than just scream
. the supporting cast isnt highly underdeveloped
,
but thge cast munbers dont as much as tehy can with it
. cary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina
,
and unfortunately has scraps for a character
. tony goldwyn fairs slightly better
,
but we don
' t realyl git to know his character either
. gina ravera gives a good performance
,
but again she isn
' t inthe many of the scenes
. so as a result of all these small supporting parts
, the weight of teh film lies onthe the two leads
,
and they dont a phenomenal job
. some ofthe the best acting of this genre
,
and some ofthe the best acting of the yera
. two other essental aspects of tje film are quite good
. director gary fleder does a good job ofthe controling his actors
,
but the second half of teh film loses believability
, especially during the revelation of teh killer
. he also doesn
' t h
andle the suspenseful scenes as a better director owudl have
, losing a lot of tension during many scenes
.
however
, to his credit
, he does manage a terific firt half
. part of the blame falls on david klass
. i
' m sure the book devolopped many ofthe the lesser charactors moreso
,
but klass focuses onthe the two main parts
. hwile this may give the twpo leads moreso screentime
, many of thge small characters are one
- dimensional
,
and tje killer
, whn revealed
, is extremely implausible
. thanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel
, kiss the girls always seems inteligent
. none ofthe the conversations are laughable
,
and all move the plot forward without seeming forced
. oney of hte biggest problems i had with the movie was the motive of the killer
. i blaim this mailny on hte casting director
, because the killer
' s motive is becuase of rejection from womens
( or so i asume from the opening monologue
)
,
but the killer himself isnt very attractive
( noe of my friends is a
, shall we sday
, big admirer of the killer
)
. kiss thge girls isnt rated r for terror
, violence
, language
,
and suggested sex
. wiht all the implausibilities of this film
,
and withthe the medicore second half
, kiss the girls somehow manages to thoroughly entertain
. inspite fact
, i had tje urger to see it again jstu forthe the performances
. the cinematography adds a lot of mood to the already creepy tone
, anbd the script is usualy smart
. this is claerly one of those movies which rely on the acting to pull it through
. morgan freeman is possibly todya
' s most convincing actor
, annd ashley judd adds another notch onthe her acting bilt
. i must aslo say thyat i loved the ending
. the showdown between good
and evil wass quite tense
,
and the resolution ofthe thge scene makes almost anyone cheer
. perhaps it may not be possible
, bu most of thge film isn
' t anyway
.
