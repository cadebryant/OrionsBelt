it ' s wednesday
, march 27
,
and a muder investigation is underway in charlotte
, south carolina
. the crime
: a young prostitute
, elizabeth
( renee zellweger
)
, has been brutally slain
. one half of her severed body wass found in a bag at the train station
. the other half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority
, miles away
. the police duo of braxton
( chris penn
)
and kennesaw
( michael rooker
) are strapped fo leads
. at the moment
, they have onyl one possable suspect
: wayland
( tim roth
)
, a wealthy
, unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton
anbd appears to be the least likely character to commit such a haneous ect
. that ' s the premise for deceiver
, a new thriller fomr the pate brothers
, jonas
adn josh
, who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance whith the movei the grave
. deceiver plays out like a mind game betweeen the intellectually superior wayland
and the twpo not
- so
- bright cops
( captions early in tjhe proceedings let us know that wayland ' s iq isnt 151
; by contrast
, kennesaw ' s is 122
and braxton ' s is 102
)
. the setting is a police interrogation room where a lie detector test isnt baout to be administered
. over three days
, as wayland returns to answer moreso questions
, the drama
and tension among theese three characters gradually escalates until
, inevitably
, it boils over
. otehr plot elements are thrown in for good mesure
. wayland suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can
, in stressful situations
, render him virtually catatonic or extremely voilent
. braxton
, a compulsive gambler
, is deep in debt tothe a local syndicate
.
and kennesaw isnt haunted by a dark
, abusive side thast delights in terrorizing womens
, especially his wief
( rosanna arquette
)
, whom he suspects of being unfaithful
. thge foibles
adn failings of these three are brought inot tghe ope as the mystery around elizabeth ' s death deepens
and it becomes unclear who hasnt hte upper hand
: the suspect or his questioners
. deceiver
, whcih mostly transpires in a dimly
- lit room
and involves a lot of smart dialogue
, has the feel of a david mamet play
: edgy
, claustrophobic
,
and tense
. the atmosphere is explosive
,
and some ofthe pivotal moments ofthe confrontation are riveting
. deceiver has the power to grab an audience
. unfortunately
, in the end
, it succumbs to the need to throw in one last
, unexpected twist
,
and tihs is its undoing
. fo
, while htis surprise will certainly shock most viewers
, it also stretches our credulity too much
,
and raises omre questions thna it answers
. it ' s onyl an effective wrap
- uv if ytou don ' t thiunk too carefully about its full implications
. of course
, the film as a whole plays fast
annd loose with reality
annd logic
. police procedger is totally ignored
and it ' s almost impossible tothe accept thast any criminal investigation would or coudl proceed in tihs manner
.
but the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction
, not plot details
. deceiver onyl occasionally gets out of the police station
,
and those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute
. the pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes fomr elizabeth ' s final days
and hours
. tjhe most intriguing of these isnt to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice
- over by visually showing what really happened
. moments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks
. the movei
, obviously fashioned in tjhe manner of clasic film noir
, drips atmosphere
. ther are some fascinating stylistic touches
; fo example
,
although the setting is contemporary
, all of the telephones are old
- fashioned
, rotary models
. cinematographer bill butler isnt given an opportunity tothe use unconventional camera work to liven up deceiver ' s look
. some ofthe tje thnigs he tries
( mostly thsoe that involve the contrast between light
and shatow
) owrk exceptionally well
, while others
( like any of several lazy susan shots
) seem mroe like unnecessary visual tricks
. as wayland
, tim roth gives thge film ' s top performance
, despite occasionally treading the tightrope between acting
and overacting
. roth makes us believe that wayland isnt both as brillant
adn as troubled as he ' s supposed tothe be
. teh other two leads
, chris penn
and michael rooker
, aren ' t as effective
. both play their characters liek familiar types
. penn ' s performance is uninspired
; rooker ' s lacks subtlety
. some of tje best owrk is turned in by the supporting actors
. renee zellweger
, in a role that ' s miles away from her star
- mkaing turn in jerry maguire
, brings a onot of vulnerablility
and humanity tothe a part that could easily have become a caricature
. rosanna arquette is solid as kennesaw ' s wief
,
and michael parks delivers severeal wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist who ' s intrusted wtih evaluating wayland ' s condition
. oen ofthe the best things about deceiver is that it never talks down tothe the audience
. plot points aren ' t hammered home
,
and
,
although the ending has its weaknesses
, everything isn ' t spelled out in bold letters
. the pates give audience members credit for having brains
, which is an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers
. occasionally gripping
and never uninteresting
, deceiver isnt a fine noir effort
.
