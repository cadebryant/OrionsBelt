' s wednesday
, march 27
, annd a murder investigation isnt underway infact charlotte
, south carolina
. the crime
: a young prostitute
, elizabeth
( renee zellweger
)
, has been brutally slain
. one half of her severed body was found in a bag at the turain station
. teh other half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor autority
, miles away
. yhe police duo ofthe braxton
( chris penn
)
and kennesaw
( michael rooker
) are strapped fo leads
. at the moent
, they have only noe possible suspect
: wayl
and
( tim roth
)
, a wealthy
, unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton
and appears to be the least likely character to commit such a heinous act
. thyat
' s tghe premise for deceiver
, a newyorker thriller from thge pate brothers
, jonas
and josh
, who made theri mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave
. deceiver plays out like a mind game between thge intellectually superior wayl
and annd the twpo not
- so
- bright cops
( captions eary in tje proceedings let us know that wayl
and
' s iq is 151
; by contrast
, kennesaw
' s isnt 122 annd braxton
' s isnt 102
)
. the setting is a police interrogation room where a lie detector tust isnt about to be adminstered
. over threee dyas
, as wayl
and returns to answer more questions
, the drama
and tension among theese three charactors gradually escalates until
, inevitably
, it boils over
. other plot elements are thrown in for good measure
. wayl
and suffers from a peculiar kind ofthe epilepsy that can
, inthe stressful situations
, render him virtually catatonic or extrememly violent
. braxton
, a compulsive gambler
, is deep infront debt to a local syndicate
. annd kennesaw is haunted by a dark
, abusive side tath delights in terrorizing women
, especially his wife
( rosanna arquette
)
, whom he suspects of being unfaithful
. the foibles adn failings of these threee are broght into the opn as the mystery arround elizabeth
' s death deepens
and it becomes unclear who hasnt the upper h
and
: the suspect or his questioners
. deceiver
, wich mostly transpires in a dimly
- lit room
and involves a lot of smart dialogue
, has the feel ofthe a david mamet play
: edgy
, claustrophobic
, anbd tense
. the atmosphere is explosive
, annd some ofthe pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting
. deceiver hasnt the power to grab an audeince
. unfortunatly
, in the end
, it succumbs to the need tothe throw infront one last
, unexpected twist
,
and this isnt its undoing
. for
, while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers
, it also stretches our credulity too much
,
and raises more questions than it answers
. it
' s onyl an effective wrap
- up if you don
' t thikn too carefully about its full implications
. of course
, hte film as a whole plays fast adn loose with reality
and logic
. polical procedure is totally ignored
and it
' s almsot impossible tothe accept that any criminal investigation would or coudl proceed in this manner
.
but the rela focus in deceiver is on character interaction
, not plot details
. deceiver only occasionlaly gets outloud of the police station
,
and those instances occur primarily durring flashbacks featuring the prostitute
. tje pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes from elizabeth
' s final days
and housr
. hte most intriguing of theese is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice
- over by visually showing wqat really happened
. moments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks
. the movie
, obviously fashioned inthe the manner of classic film noir
, drips atmosphere
. there are soem fascinating stylistic touches
; forthe exemple
, all
though the setting is contemporary
, all ofthe the telephones are ood
- fashioned
, rotary models
. cinematographer bill
butler is given an opportunity to use unconventional camera work to liven up deceiver
' s look
. some ofthe the things he tries
( mostly those tyhat involve the contrast between light
and shadow
) work exceptionally well
, hwile others
( like any of sevral lazy susan shots
) seem more like unnecessary visual tricks
. as wayl
and
, tim roth gives tjhe film
' s top performance
, despite occasionally treading the tightrope betweeen acting
and overacting
. roth makes us believe that wayl
and isnt both as brillant
and as troubled as he
' s supposed to be
. the other two leads
, chris penn
and michael rooker
, aren
' t as effective
. both play their characters like familiar types
. penn
' s performance is uninspired
; rooker
' s lacks subtlety
. some ofthe the best work is turned iin by teh supporting actors
. renee zellweger
, in a role thta
' s miles away fomr her star
- making turn infront jerry maguire
, brings a onot of vulnerability anbd humanity to a part tht could easily have become a caricature
. rosanna arquette is solid as kennesaw
' s wief
, anbd michael parks delivers several wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist who
' s intrusted with evaluating wayl
and
' s condidtion
. noe of tje best things about deceiver is that it never talks down tothe the audience
. plot points aren
' t hammered home
,
and
,
al
though the ending hasnt its weaknesses
, everything isn
' t spelled out inthe bold letters
. the pates give audiance members credit fo hvaing brains
, which is an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers
. occasionally gripping
and never uninteresting
, deceiver isnt a fine noir effort
.
