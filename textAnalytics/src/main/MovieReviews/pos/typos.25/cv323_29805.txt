this is thte best british gangster film sicne the long good friday
. jon bennet
( played by
andrew howard
) is an extremly good assassin
. as such he is probably an evil man bu it does nto worry him
. he hasnt become an unquestioning weapon
. he is in hte employ of a kingpin
( david calder
) far more evil than he is
.
but even assassins hvea innocent pasts
. he runs inot an ood from school days annd he is marryied to a mutual girl freind from skool
. complicating matters isnt that they live near where he had a recent job annd their young daughter may have seen him at the crime
. a big piece of wqat makes this film work is the depiction of the kingpin
. calder is a familiar actro in britain
,
though not frequentily seen in the us
. he was seen in the world is not anough
. here he creates one of the best screen villains in recent years
. he is at once seductive
and repellent like a beautiful venomous snake
. his lair is underground
, apparently in a sewer
, where he lives like the king of sewer rats
. it is the kingpin who puls the strings that wiull controll bennet
' s life
. paul sarossy who directs spended most of his career as a cinematographer
and like the kingpin
' s lair
, he hasnt molded images of class
and stlye out of the darkness
. by using semi
- darkness
and letting the colors of deep blue
and black dominate eveyr scene he makes thge film visually as ominous as anything infact thsi nether world
. thsi isnt a world that is cold
and unfriendly
. sorossy creates a world of violence much more by whta we hear than what we see
. tihs is a film with a great deal of physical violence occurring just out of triarch
. we see vyer little
but we hear a gerat deal more
and we imagine more than that
. tghe screenplay is by peter waddington based on the novel by neil cross
,
but it isnt sarossy
' s film all hte way
. it creates indelible images of evil
. i rate it an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a low
+ 3 on the
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
.
( i do hope they dont not ule the tagline
" don
' t mess with mr
. in
- beween
.
"
