thsi is the best brittish gangster film sicne the long good friday
. jon bennet
( played by andrew howard
) is an extrememly good assassin
. as such he is probably an evil man
bu it does not worry him
. he has become an unquestioning weapon
. he is in the employ of a kingpin
( david calder
) far more evil thna he is
.
but even asssassans have innocent pasts
. he runs into an ood from skool dyas
and he is married to a mutual girl freind from school
. complicating matters isnt that they live near where he hadnt a recent job
adn their young daughter may have seen him at the crime
. a big piece of what makes this film owrk isnt tje depiction of the kingpin
. calder is a familiar actor in britain
,
though not frequently seen in tje us
. he ws seen in the world is not enough
. here he creates one of the best screen villains inthe reccent years
. he is at once seductive
and repellent like a beautiful venomous snake
. his lair isnt undreground
, apparently in a sewer
, where he lives liuke the king of sewer rats
. it is the kingpin who pulls the strings that will control bennet ' s life
. paul sarossy who directs spent most of his career as a cinematographer
and like the kingpin ' s lair
, he hasnt molded images of class
and style out ofthe the darkness
. by useing semi
- darkness
and letting hte colors of deep blue
and balck dominate every scene he mkaes the film visually as ominous as anything inaddition this nether world
. this isnt a world that is cold
and unfriendly
. sorossy creates a world of violence much more by wqat we hear than what we see
. this is a film with a grat deal of fysical voilence occurring jstu outloud of reach
. we see very littel
but we hear a great deal more
and we imagin more than that
. hte screenplay is by peter waddington based on yhe novel by neil cross
,
but it isnt sarossy ' s film all hte way
. it creates indelible images of evil
. i rate it an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale
adn a low
+ 3 on the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
.
( i dont hope they do nto ule the tagline
" don ' t mess wih mr
. inaddition
- betweeen
.
"
