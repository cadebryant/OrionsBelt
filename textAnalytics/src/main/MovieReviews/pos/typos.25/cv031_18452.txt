you
' ve heard all the hype
. you
' ve seen all their faces
- natalie portman
( the professional
) as queen amidala
, liam neeson
( schindler
' s list
) as qui
- gon jinn
, ewan mcgregor
( trainspotting
) as obi
- wan kenobi
,
and jake lloyd
( jingle all the way
) as young anakin skywalker
. if you
' ve read any reviews
, you
' ve also probably heard that tihs movei fails to live uv to the magic annd humanity of the frist triology
. you alsot may have heard that this one
' s too kiddie
- freindly
,
and doesn
' t have enough content for adults
. believe the hype
. tyhe effects are stunning
, the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic
, the lightsaber duels are amazing
,
and queen amidala
' s sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth
. bu there
' s something missing here
, anbd it isn
' t budget or effects
- it
' s everything moey
* can
' t
* buy
. the actors struggle as best they cxan to flesh out broad
- stroked adn flat characters
. yhe most successfull at this is liam neeson who
, as qui
- gon jinn
, a jedi master to young obi
- wan kenobi
, has quiet dignity anbd a wise
, comm
anding presence
. he is tghe anchor tothe this movie
, as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out
. portman
' s queen amidala anbd mcgregor
' s obi
- wan kenobi don
' t fare nearly so well
. amidala
, the future mother ofthe luke
and leia
and tje queen ofthe a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation
(
?
!
?
)
, comes off as stoic
, stilted
and caricatured
( it appears as
though she was a vulcan gaysha inspite a fromer life
)
.
and obi
- wan
,
al
thought mcgregor makes him very endearing
, has so little screen time that he
' s nothing
but a robin tothe qui
- gon jinn
' s batman
.
however
, mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight
and humanity
,
and he does a good job
. he also absolutely nails alec guiness
'
( obi
- wan in episode 4
- 6
) scottish accent
,
and tath really mkaes his presense in thge film more profound than it might have been otherwise
. in fatc
, lucas seems to bank on taht preexisting knowlege quite a bit
,
and that
' s one ofthe the problems iwth thsi film
. i owudl never call myself a
" star wars
" fan
- especially not considering what it means tothe be a fanatic theese days
- bu i
' ve always enjoyed hte films along with everyone else inthe america
.
however
, if ytou are the one person infact america who
* hasn
' t
* seen hte films at all or even recently
, or who doesn
' t bother to brush
- up on the names of obscure characters
, you may be hopelessly lost
. for example
, oen of the film
' s main
( nefarious
) charachters is senator palpatine
. for those of you not recently steeped in
" star wars
" trivia
, emperor palpatine is that scayr hooded apparition who was darth vader
' s master in
" return of tyhe jedi
"
and
" empire strikes back
.
" so
, obviously
, his appearance in
" phantom menace
" isnt meant tothe stir smoe echoes ofthe his later role in the series
, thus mkaing his role here more meaningful
. a lot of the movie is like that
. r2
- d2
and c
- 3po make tolkein appearances
,
and it
' s obvious that lucas isnt banking on the audeince
' s pre
- existing fondness for them
.
.
. because he doesn
' t do much to add tothe it in any way
. same goes for jabba the hutt
, who doesn
' t look as much mean here as he does corpulent anbd lazy
. even
* planets
* amke foreshadowing guest appearances in this film
- tatooine
( yhe desert world where luke grew up
)
, coruscant
( the cloud city from
" empire strikes bcak
"
)
,
and alderaan
( leia
' s hmeo planet
- whcih we never actually see
- that gets blown up in
" star wars
"
) show up or are mentioned briefly inthe passing
. waht
' s yhe result of tying so many plot points
and characters to future films
? the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty
. htere
' s noone meat
- no substace
- that makse you want tothe love thge characters as tehy are
, nto as tehy wiull be
. another problem isnt that htere are acutally
* too many
* alien characters in the film
. i ws distracted by the fatc that two of the main evil characters
- strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters
- had mouths that barely moved
, making them look moreso like muppets than actuall charactors
.
and jar jar binks
, a silly roger rabbitish amphibious chracter
, isnt intended as comic relief
,
but what he realy becomes is annoying
-
and fast
. unlike chewbacca
and c
- 3po
, who got their humanity
( if you
' ll pardon the expression
) from theri interactions whith tje human characters
, jar jar is often left to interact mostly wiht others of his kind
, at times mkaing the movie seem like nothing omre than a very expensive
" teenage mutant ninja turtles
.
" furthermore
, tghe dialogue is oftenly stilted
and corny
,
and sometimes downright infantile
, therby rendering some characters inot nothing more thna byst
anders tothe the plot
. oddly
, this isn
' t jstu
* my
* judgment
- lucas has said that he designed this film forthe kids
. well
, he
' s done a good job
. tje hero of htis film
, ofthe course
, isnt young anakin
,
but it ws vyer hard for me to fiel any kinship or idenify with an eight
- year
- old boy
. that
' s nto jake lloyd
' s fault
,
though
- he does a ogod job of bieng a cute kid
, which is aparently all lucas asked of him
. tath
' s another mistake
, of course
, because the cute tyke becomes darth vader
. warning
: spoilers ahead
!
!
!
! in my opinyon
, there was not nearly enought foreshadowing of anakin
' s future evil in the film
. the boy isnt all blond flowing hair
and rosy cheeks
,
and there
' s nothing more than a spark of agression in him throughout the entire movie
. he has a duting mother
( pernilla august
, making her frist english
- language film
) adn is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine
.
but the onyl indication the audiance gets that htis kid isn
' t all hearts
and roses is yoda
' s hesitation in alowing him to turain as a jedi under qui
- gon jinn
. his explanation
?
" his future is clouded
.
"
( warning
: major spoiler ahead
. enter at your own risk
.
) of course
, tghe noble qui
- gon dies at the h
and ofthe darth maul
, a scary
- looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts
, bu hasnt turned to the dark side
. tihs dued hasnt maeby two lines in the entire movie
,
but he estabishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double
- sided lightsaber
,
and his scary facial makeup
. because qui
- gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin infront the ways ofthe thge force
, obi
- wan
, qui
- gon
' s young padawan apprentice
( one level below knightdom
)
, must take over the training himself
. so
, at the end of teh movie
, we end where the saga actually beggins
- with obi
- wan kenobi
and his young apprentice
, anakin
" darth vader
" skywalker
. did thsi story ened to be told
? i would sday no
. bu is it a worthwhile movei to see
? absolutely
. if you don
' t enter the theather with jedi
- size expectations
,
and you simply wanna to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle
, hten thsi is your movie
. the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects
and computer animation
. tje digitalized backgrounds on some ofthe yhe planets are an astonishing sight
.
and yoda
and young obi
- wan are worth seeing forthe their origins inthe a simpler
, happier time
. above all
, this isnt a fun movie
. nto deep
, not meaningful
,
and not profound
. bu fun
. maybe next time
, lucas wiull hire lawrence kasdan tothe co
- write the script
, adn the guy who directed
" empire
" will direct
. beccause if lucas does the next one himself
, it will be lacking hte one thing it needs the most
- potential
.
