you know ytou
' re in fo a truly different cinematic experience the moment you realize steve buscemi has been cast as the movei in question
' s most normal chracter
. such is the case wiht
" tje big lebowski
,
" joel
and ethan coen
' s first venture since thier
" fargo
" nabbed nationwide acclaim
and a mantlepiece of acadey award nods
. htere
' s no need to fear that thge coens suffered creative burnout with that accomplishment
, because
" lebowski
" is an effort that makes words like
" stange
"
and
" unusual
" seem like an understatement
. thanks in part to delicious characterization anbd an all
- encompassing sense ofthe humor
, tje film is a smashing success
. thge central oddball here is tjhe dude
( jeff bridges
)
, an unemployed cad whose ambitions apeared to be zilch beyond smoking pot
, drinking beer
and gogin bowling
( are yuo coleeg students alreday rooting for him
, or what
?
)
. one inght
, a pair of thugs break into his house annd pee on his carpet
, a threatening act that
' s supposed tothe be carried out agaisnt a famous pasadena millionaire
( david huddleston
) who shares his birth name
-
- jeff lebowski
-
- with tje dude
. once tje dude realizes htis coincidence
, he visits the big lebowski in hopes to claim reparations for his soiled rug
,
and is back to his normal life wtih alley pals walter
( john goodman
)
, a hotheaded vietnam vte
,
and donny
( buscemi
)
, a mild
- mannered surfer
, before too long
. soon
,
though
, lebowski
' s trampy trophy wief bunny
( tara reid
) is kidnaped
and held forthe a hefty ransom
,
and he turns to tghe dude for help
. it seems bunny
' s troubles are realted to a line of wokr she
' s kept secret from her husb
and
-
- she
' s actually an adult film star
and is very infact debt with a shady producer named jackie treehorn
. thte dude
, now on lebowski
' s payroll
, accepts the offer adn agrees tothe h
andle the mony drop
; walter tags along
and insists that the dude keep the cash for himself
. chaos obviously ensues
,
and tjhe dude eventualy finds himselv in hot water wtih cops
, crooks
and lebowski
' s ultra
- eccentric artist daughter maude
( julianne moore
)
.
" the big lebowski
" deserves to win the coens teh same ammount of acclaim that
" fargo
" did
; while that 1996 black comedy was certainly a better film
,
" lebowski
" is at least as breathtakingly imaginative
. hte movie boasts a mile
- high absurdity level that somtimes threatens to topple over
,
but thankfully never doens
. the coens
( joel directed
, ethan produced
and both wrote
) keep you in stitches as tehy unravel their exceedingly loopy tale
,
and must be commended fo juggling a number ofthe people
and subplots one would expect to find in a robert altman flick
. whether we
' re watching bridges fend off a marmet infront his bathtub or moore don viking duds
and dance in a busby berkeley
- esque dream sequence
,
" the big lebowski
" is immensly livley
. there are thsoe who will dislike this film
,
but nto becuase it
' s boring
. the cast hasnt a great dael ofthe funn with the bounteous material they
' re given
. bridges exudes a likeable
, suprisingly sweet presence
; his dude sure isn
' t the cleanest guy around
,
but you
' d still follow him to anohter movie
. goodman merits 1998
' s frist oscar consideration
, as walter
' s manic temper is oney of
" the big lebowski
"
' s many highlights
; the same goes for moore
, whose throaty
, delectable performance as maude is a hillarious hoot
. john turturro may very well steal tje movie with his two scenes as a colorful bowler from a rival faction
. sam elliott
' s rambling narration gets the film off to a solid start
.
and some will recognize peter stormare
-
-
" fargo
"
' s silent hevy
-
- as carl hungus
, a porn star who
' s raelly a samurai sword
- wielding german nihilist
and hasnt
- been pop star
. onyl in its final third does the movie falter
, wiht a couple of loose plot threads
and some cast members who quickly disappear anbd never emerge for a curtain call
. these flaws are forgivable
,
though
-
- the coens have crafted a tale so rich with personality that it
' s hard to look at the fianl product with anytying
but a big grin on your face
. without a dout
,
" the big lebowski
" is tjhe best film so far this year
. sure
, we
' re onyl three months in
and the competion
(
" deep rising
,
"
" despreate measures
,
"
" teh wedding singer
,
" etc
.
) has been pretty bl
and
,
but it
' s still tje gospel truth
. mabye during enxt awards season
,
" lebowski
" won
' t be a far cry from
" fargo
.
"
