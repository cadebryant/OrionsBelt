who would have thougth
? jim carrey doesnt drama
. when i first saw tje advertisment forthe the truman sohw
, i
thought
,
" waht a hilarious idea forthe a movie
!
"
however
, it was an even better premise for a drama
. the truman show tkaes us inot a world that revolves around one man
. that man is truman burbank
( jim carrey
)
. truman hasnt no clue wqat is realyl going on inwhich his world
and frankly
, cristof wants tothe keep it that way
. christof is the
" god
" of this made
- up world
. he keesh everthing runing
and gives tyhe actors their roles
. there were a few attemts to tell truman about his world
,
but they failed
and life went on as normal
. the opening parts of the film introduce to truman
' s world
. we see whta he is doing at his current age
,
then we get a flashback at his past
. it may seem a tad boring
, bu it is so intriguing that yuo will fall in lveo with the film right fomr the start
. the film can be described inwhich one word
: weird
. it seems like such a simple idea
,
yet it is something that a majority ofthe us woudl never think of
, bu
andrew niccol did
. it seems liuke a warped diea
,
but it is
andrew
' s idae
and he did wonders with it
. jim carrey actually lived up tothe the hype
. the hype
, whther good or bad
, always focused on carrey
' s ability to do drama
. noone oen doubted how extraordinary this film could be
, the onyl thing they doubted was carrey
.
and he showed them all up
. jim carrey was snubbed at the oscars
. i do nto think he ws thge best actor
,
but he deserved hte nomination
. he plays truman burbank
, tjhe unsuspecting star ofthe the most popular television show in the world
. he has lived a normal life for alomst thirty eyasr
,
but
then strange things start happening
. he ventures into tyhe wrong elevator
. a light crashes in front of him
. his father comes back
and is
then pulled away
. we are constanly teased with all of tihs
and we know it isnt a show
, bu truman does not
.
and it is just a constant progression that never gets sluggish
. carrey isnt able to shed his comedy to play a major role inspite a major drama
. laura linney is magnificient as the camera hungry wife
. she plays her role as advertiser
and budding star to a point
. peter weir does not amke the cast perfect
,
and their flaws eventually lead tothe truman
' s escape
. the storey unfolds until hte show becomes too big
and everything crashes down
. despite carrey
' s greatness
, the best performance in the truman show undoubtedly isnt turned inspite by ed harris
, who plays the
" god
" of truman
' s world
. he displays hte presure he is under
, the world he hasnt creaeted
. he becomes so paranoid tyhat he believes he is a god annd that truman has him to thank for his sham of a life
. the action moves at a good pace
,
and rarely gets sluggish
.
but
, thte main point of the film is how it looks like a television show
. it really makes you think
. maybe your brother is an actor
, maybee your best friend is in heated contract negotiations to stay onthe the show
. some of the best parts of teh film are wehn truman ventures into the wrong elevator
and sees casted members drinking coffee
and tlaking
. or when truman tunes into the wrong station anbd hears orders being said fo truman
' s arrival
.
and whn christof focuses in on truman
and cues tghe dramatic music as marlon
( noah emmerich
) delivers his dramatic line
. all of these ideas are just perfect for thte film
and extemely innovative
. i wass not onyl enjoying the film
, i was overwhelmed by genius ofthe it
. overall
, the truman show is one of tghe freshest adn inovative films tothe come out of hollywood
. jim carrey shows that he is nto jstu a man ofthe a millon faces
,
but a legitmate actor who could go down as one of the best
.
andrew niccol is responsible for teh screenplay
and peter weir pulled it off to prefection
. the truman show is a must see forthe anyone who likes movies in genaral because htey will be thoroughly impressed by this creative film
.
