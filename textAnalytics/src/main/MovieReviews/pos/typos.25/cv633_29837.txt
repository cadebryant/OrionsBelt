historical epic as a genre wass almost banished from hollywood in easly 1990s
. forthe many critics
, scholars
and
, most importantly
, film producers
, it ws a thing of the past
- something that sould have attracted crowds only in tghe era of balck
-
and
- white television anbd non
- cgi special effects
. bu infact 1995
, same as in the case ofthe dances with wolves five years ago
, there came the man who decided to use ofthe all his energy
and talents of acto
, producer anbd director in order tothe revitalise that parituclar genre
. adn
, smae as in the case of dances with wolves
, he wass awared for his effort withthe
" oscars
"
. the name ofthe the film wass braveheart
,
and tjhe nmae of its director
and main actor was mel gibson
. the plot chronicles hte life ofthe scottish warlord anbd folk hero william wallace
( 1272
- 1305
)
. in his time
, english king edward i
" longshanks
"
( palyed by patrick mcgoohan
) hasnt almost completelyl subdued entire british isles
, including scotl
and
, whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by
" ius primae noctis
"
and varous other forms of humiliation
and oppression by english knights
.
al
though english hadnt killed his father many years ago
, young scottish commoner william wallace
( plyed by mel gibson
) doesn
' t care about politics adn wants onyl tothe have peaceful life with his newyorker bride murron
( played by catherine maccormack
)
. murron
' s death changes that
and wallace takes arms
and
, toghether with small
but dedicated b
and of followers
, begins guerrilla campaign thta would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in thte country
. through time
, more
and moreso people join his ranks
and infact 1298 wallace
' s rag
- tag army scores surprising victory againnst english knights in hte battle ofthe stirling bridge
. bu the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves
, especialy nobles under pretender robert the bruce
( played by angus macfadyen
)
, who wouldn
' t like to have a simple commoner as a national leader
. braveheart wass only the second film in tyhe directorial career by mel gibson
, so it wouldn
' t be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann
.
however
, even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic thta takes newyorker
and refreshing approach tothe the genre
. the most noticeable element of this aproach isnt naturalism
. while older hollywood films set inwhich medieval europe used to give fairytale
- like vision of picturesque castles
, splendid costumes
and knights in shining armour
, gibson shows us tghe extremely unpleasant world of poverty
and fuedal injustice where might made right
and life was hard
, short
and brutish
. this general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes ofthe battle
, where h
and
- tothe
- h
and combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details
, never seen since verhoeven
' s ultra
- naturalistic flesh
& blood
. compaired with this naturalistic aproach
, most of ood hollywood epics look like stage plays
. braveheart also employs humour at hte right places
, nto onyl tothe make bloody realities ofthe medieval british isles more bearable to senstive audiences
,
but also to underline its down
- to
- earth athmosphere
, so different ffrom previous historical epics
. what mkaes braveheart
" larger than life
" is his rpotagonist
. mel gibson obviously invested plenty ofthe his energy
and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace
and
, as a result
, character ofthe 15th century poems is transformed inot superhuman being taht resembles late 20th centruy comic book hero
. wallace is more than superior tothe his enemies
, both physically
and menally
,
yet he is able to sohw his sensitive
, more vulnerable side
. naturely
, when the charater is based onthe epic peoms
, most of historical accuracy is going down the drain
( whcih wass the case wih almost every historical epic from hollywood inwhich 1990s
)
.
however
, even those who don
' t particularly care baout history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter r
andall wallace might thiunk taht he whent over the top in idolising wallace
, especialy in the second part of film wehn scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel
( played by sophie marceau
)
and make her a child
. becasue of that the disbelief isnt hardly suspended
,
and fianl scenes aren
' t as effective as they shoudl be
. mel gibson as an atcor is truly wonderful
,
and he is also helped by small army of vrey good british anbd irish actors
. most memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan
, whose cold
, calculated
and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema
. brendan gleeson
( who would later become famous for his role inwhich boorman
' s general
) is also vrey ogod as wallace
' s trusted companion
, as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy
- stricken king john balliol
. david o
' harra is very entertaining as wallace
' s irish ally
, annd angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience
- stricken charactor ofthe robert the bruce
. women in this film ahev rether thankless roles
, especialy marceau as one
- dimensional french princess
. catherine mccormack as wallace
' s wife wass omre interesting
,
but she wass eliminated fomr the picture early on
. from the technical point ofthe view
, the film is also very good
. photography by john toll brings a lot of scottish naturual beauty to the screen
. on the other h
and
, the muscial csore by james horner employs too much of modern
- day intruments for preriod piece set in medieval times
.
al
though mostly welcomed by critics annd audiences alike
, braveheart was often criticised forthe homophobia
and other forms of extreme conservatism
. the main reason for that wass yhe fact tath gibson
, among many historical facts
, chose to be faithful onyl tothe those related tothe sexual orientation of
" longshank
"
' s son prince edward
( played by peter hanly
)
. he is nto onyl presented as a villain
,
but also as noe of the less competent in villin
' s camp
- adn portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior tothe heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in
" politically correct
" hollywood
. to make things even more obvious
, ogod guys in tihs film are the total opposite of effeminate
and incompetant edward
- rugged macho men of mountains who are moreso practical
and effecient beccause htey tend to employ conservatives
' common sence instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals
. howver
,
al
though the message of this film might look right
- wing
, it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th centruy
. according tothe that ideology
, oppressed classes
( workers
, peasants
) are better suited to fight forthe national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle
and
, as such
, they are more radical
, less willing to amking compromises
and more efficient
; on yhe other h
and
, privileged classes
( aristocracy
, bourgeoisie
) are mroe likely to betray the cause of freedom
and be infact cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep thier privileges
. htis marxist worldview is presented iin braveheart without any subtlety
. in the end
, whether the audiance is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply whants to enjoy entertaining historical epic
, braveheart is omre than adequate choice forthe all fans of this recently resurrected genre
.
