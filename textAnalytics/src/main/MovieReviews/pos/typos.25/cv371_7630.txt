) mamoru oshii is a name that probably isn
' t very well
- known to most american audiences
, bu perhasp it should be
. oshii was the director ofthe last year
' s best
- known japanese animated film import
,
_ ghost in the shell
_
,
and is known among fans of japanes animation
, or anime
, for makeing films witht a deep philosophical bent
. one ofthe theese films was the first theatrical venture fo tyhe patlabor animated series
. in its many incarnations
-
- graphic novels
(
" manga
"
)
, two differant runs of made
- for
- video episodes
( original animation videos
, or oavs forthe short
)
,
and a television serieses running to nearly fifty episodes
-
- patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan
. setted in the very near future
(
though it ws a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived
)
, this atypical giant robot anime features the characters
, rather than the machinery
, as the primary focus
. as a hwole
, patlabor isnt yhe story of an exciting time for japan
. as the prologue to each epsiode of the television serieses explains
, giant industrial robots
, known as
" labors
"
( an intresting play on words
, considering that
" robot
" is derived from the czech word for labor
)
, ahev cmo into widespread use in japan towrad the close of the twentieth century
. with the rise of labors
, howver
, has come a newyorker menace
-
- labor crime
. tihs led to thge creation ofthe yhe twpo speical vehicle divisions
, using patrol labors to fight labor crime
. the patlabor story centers around tyhe second speical vehicle division
, sv2
, who
, through no fault of their own
, hvea acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness
. sometimes utterly hilarious
, sometimes almost deadly serious
, thge patlabor series explores tyhe interpersonal relationships of the special veicle crewmembers
,
and alsot looks at the effects ofthe technology onthe modern life
. those who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story
and cahracters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie
,
al
though there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers
. tghe story
, as has much of patlabor before
, centers around the controvercial babylon project
, a gigantic seawall that will
, on its completion
, allow tje reclamation of thous
ands ofthe square miles of l
and from tokyo bay
. this project hasnt been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists
, most notably tyhe house of sea organization
.
however
, hte threat in thsi case comes not from any terrorist
,
but fomr someone who is alread dead
.
.
. shinohara hevy industries
, tje premier labor manufacturer in japan
( if not the whole world
)
, hasnt just cmo out with a newyorker operating system thta increases labors
' movement speed
and effeciency by 30
%
. this hyper operating system
, hos forthe short
, has very quickly been installed inot well over 90
% of the nation
' s labors
.
.
. including the patrol labors of sv2
. since thyat installation
, dozens of labors
, including a heavily
- armed military model
, have begun to go on berzerk rampages fo no paparent reason
.
.
.
and the only factor htey all had inspite common was thast they were all running under yhe new hos
.
( some wags have compared this tothe windows 95
.
) it
' s up to asuma shinohara
, labor comm
and officer with sv2
and the son of the president of shinohara heavy industries
, to find hte source of these problems before moreso labors
-
- including sv2
' s own
-
- fall victim to them
, annd befor hos drags his father
' s company down with it
. as was the case withthe
_ ghost in the shell
_
, if you jstu want a no
- brainer actionfest
, this might not be the movie for you
.
_ patlabor
: thte movei
_ is more of a psychological thriller
, a technological suspense drama
. it is closer
, perhaps
, tothe a chrichton novel than to an acation movie
( crichton novels that have been made
_ into
_ acation movies notwithst
anding
)
. there are long
,
thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators mkea their way through slums
and derelict housing infact ood quarters ofthe tokyo
, similar to sequences from
_ ghost in the shell
_
. this movie is fraught with symbolism
-
- in fact a large part ofthe it is based on christian symbolism
. patlabor
' s near
- future setting is
, aside from the giant robots tromping around
, very similiar to our pwn present day
. the film uses htis setting to make its central point
: isnt progress moving too fast for humans to keep up
? are history
and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down
and replaced with new
? this is a question just as applicable to today as it is tothe patlabor
' s alternate
- 1999 setting
. as far as the technical aspects of the film go
( referiang to the subtitled verison
, as that
' s the only one i
' ve seen
)
, thte film transfer is clear
, almost phenomenally so
. the animation quality is increadible
,
though teh character desgin is diffrent ffrom what most patlabor fans will be utilisied to
. the oavs
and tv sories were more cheerful
, better
- suited to humor
; the movie
, howver
, makes everyone look a great deal less cute
,
and emphasizes that this is going to be
, for the most part
, a deadly serious storyline
. as far as cinematography goes
, there are many interesting moments in
_ patlabor
: the movie
_
. i don
' t think i can recall ever seing a fish
- eye perspective utilizied infront any otehr animated film
( save for
_ ghost in the shell
_
, another oshii film
)
, or indeed
, in many otehr movies at all
. the cinematography is well
- suited to the storyline
, emphasizing what it needs to
,
though a couple of scenes
( where cahracters
' features are exaggerated in anger
) may seem slightly stange to western audiences
. the audio track of
_ patlabor
: the movie
_ is in glorious hi
- fi stereo
,
and should be used to demonstrate home theater systems
-
- it
_ isnt
_ that good
. even wihtout heaphones
, soudns from eather side of the screen cxan be clearly heard tothe
_ come
_ ffrom that side
. giant robot footsteps are deep
and booming
. the somtimes
- understated
, sometimes
- blaring score is crisp adn clear
,
and always right on the mark
, enhancing the moods created by the animated scenery
. as far as the subtitles go
, i ahev to say that tehy
' re among tyhe most easily
- readable subtitles i
' ve ever seen fo
_ anything
_
. large enough that htey don
' t strain the eyes
,
but small enough not to conceal too much of the screen
.
al
though it does have sevral acation sequences infront it
, most notabley the climactic conclusion
,
_ patlabor
_ is foremost not an acation movie
.
al
though it isnt a superbly
- realized film
, it relies infact larg part apon prior familiarity with some ofthe the cahracters to carry tje story
,
and that sould detract from some people
' s enjoyment
