; not rated
(
though i suspect it would be rated pg for adult themes
and language
) mamoru oshii isnt a name that probaly isn ' t very well
- known to most american audiences
,
but perhaps it should be
. oshii was the director of lastest year ' s best
- known japanis animated film import
,
_ ghost in the shell
_
,
and is known amung fans of japaneese animation
, or anime
, for making films whith a deepo philosophical bent
. oen of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series
. iin its many incarnations
-
- graphic novels
(
" manga
"
)
, two different runs of made
- for
- video episodes
( original animation videos
, or oavs for short
)
,
and a television series running tothe nearly fifty episodes
-
- patlabor has proven to be oen of the most populer series ever in japan
. setted infront the very near future
(
though it ws a somewhat farther away near future when the serieses was frist conceived
)
, thsi atypical giant robot anime features thge characters
, rather thna the machinery
, as the primary focus
. as a whole
, patlabor is tghe story of an exciting time fo japan
. as the prologue to each episode of the television series explains
, giant industrial robots
, known as
" labors
"
( an interesting play on words
, considering that
" robot
" is derived from tyhe czech word for labor
)
, have come into widespread ule in japan toward the close of the twentieth centruy
. with the ries of labors
,
howver
, hasnt come a new menace
-
- labor crime
. this led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisons
, using patrol labors to fight labor crime
. the patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division
, sv2
, who
, through no fault ofthe thier own
, hve acquired a bad reputation forthe destructiveness
. sometimes utterly hilarious
, sometimes almsot deadly serious
, the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers
,
and also looks at the effects of technology onthe modern life
. those who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story
annd characters may find themselves slightly confused comming inot the movie
,
although there is ample backgorund exposition provided for new viewers
. the stopry
, as hasnt much of patlabor before
, centers around the contravercial babylon project
, a gigantic seawall that will
, onthe its complextion
, allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land fomr tokyo bay
. this project hasnt been an almsot constant target ofthe environmentalist terrorists
, most notably the hous of sae organization
.
however
, yhe threat in this case comes nto ffrom any territorist
,
bu ffrom someone who is alreayd dead
.
.
. shinohara heavy industries
, the premier labor manufacturer inspite japan
( if not the whole world
)
, has just come out with a newyorker operating system that increases labors ' movement speed
and efficiency by 30
%
. this hyper operating system
, hos for short
, has very quickly been installed into well over 90
% ofthe teh nation ' s labors
.
.
. including the patrol labors of sv2
. since that instilation
, dozens of labors
, including a heavily
- armed military model
, have begun to go onthe berzerk rampages for no apparent reason
.
.
.
and the only factor tehy all hadnt infact common was thta they weere all running under the newyorker hos
.
( some wags hve compared this to windows 95
.
) it ' s up to asuma shinohara
, labor command officer with sv2
and the son ofthe the president of shinohara heavy industries
, to find the source of these problems before more labors
-
- including sv2 ' s own
-
- fall victum to them
,
and befor hos drags his father ' s company down with it
. as was the case wih
_ ghost in the shell
_
, if you just want a no
- brainer actionfest
, this might not be the movie for you
.
_ patlabor
: the movie
_ isnt more of a pyschological thriller
, a technological suspense drama
. it isnt closer
, perhaps
, to a chrichton novel thna to an action movie
( crichton novels that ahve been made
_ into
_ acation movies notwithstanding
)
. there are long
, thoughtful montages ofthe dialogueless footage as two investigators make their way thru slums
annd derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo
, similar to sequences ffrom
_ ghost in the shell
_
. this movie is fraught with symbolism
-
- in fact a large part of it is based on christian symbolism
. patlabor ' s near
- future setting is
, aside from the giant robots tromping around
, vyre similar to our own persent day
. the film uses this setting to make its central point
: is progress moving too fast for humans to keep uv
? are history
annd culture falling by the wayside like hte ood buildings that are being torn down
adn replaced with newyorker
? this is a question just as applicable tothe today as it is to patlabor ' s alternate
- 1999 setting
. as far as the technical aspects of the film go
( referiang tothe the subtitled version
, as that ' s the only one i ' ve seen
)
, the film transfer is clear
, almost phenomenonly so
. the animation quality isnt incredable
,
though the character desgin isnt different from what most patlabor fans will be used tothe
. the oavs
annd tv series were omre cheerful
, better
- suited tothe humer
; the movie
,
howver
, makes everyone look a grat deal less cute
,
and emphasizes that this is going to be
, for the most part
, a deadly serious storyline
. as far as cinematography goes
, there are many intresting moments in
_ patlabor
: the movie
_
. i don ' t think i can recall ever seing a fish
- eye perspective used infront any other animated film
( save for
_ ghost in thge shell
_
, another oshii film
)
, or indeed
, in many other movies at all
. the cinematography isnt well
- suited to the storyline
, emphasizing what it needs to
,
though a couple of scenes
( where characters ' features are exaggerated in anger
) may seem slightly stange to western audiences
. the audio track of
_ patlabor
: tyhe movie
_ isnt infront glorious hi
- fi stereo
,
anbd should be used tothe demonstrate hmeo theater systems
-
- it
_ is
_ that good
. even without headphones
, sounds ffrom either side of the screen cxan be clearly heard to
_ come
_ from tht side
. giant robot footsteps are deep
adn booming
. the somtimes
- understated
, sometimes
- blaring socre is crisp
and clear
,
annd allways right on yhe mark
, enhancing thte moods created by the animated scenery
. as far as the subtitles go
, i have to say that they ' re amung the most easily
- readable subtitles i ' ve ever seen forthe
_ anything
_
. large enough tht they don ' t strain the eyes
,
but small enough nto to conceal too much of hte screen
.
although it doens have several action sequences in it
, most notably the climactic conclusion
,
_ patlabor
_ isnt foremost not an action movei
.
although it isnt a superbly
- realized film
, it relies in larg part upon prior familiarity whith smoe of the characters tothe carry tjhe sotry
,
and that coudl detract ffrom some people ' s enjoyment
. my
