no filmmaker deconstructs a story as well as atom egoyan
. i
' m refering
, specifically
, to tyhe narrative form
. in the sweet hereafter
, egoyan tells his story inspite a silimar framework to his exotica or the adjuster
. said story
, of a futal school bus accident in the small town of sam dent
, british columbia
, tyhat shatters the morale of the locals
, is told inwhich a most unstraightforward manner
. when thge film opens
, the accident hasnt already happend
,
and stephens
( the wonderful holm
)
, a polite ambulance
- chasr
, has arrived withthe tjhe promise of a lawsuit thta will eek out the truth of what really occurred that fateful morning
. throughout
, we git to meet the parents ofthe the dead
, broken souls who follow stephens like
" the pied piper
"
( passages of which are read durring the film
)
.
but there is oney living pasenger
, the paralyzed nicole
( polley
)
, whose dark secrets ofthe a life before tje accident may affect her decision to testify
. we finally do see tje accident
, about three quarters into the film
, which is a stunning visual effect
. a horrific long take tath shows the bus sliding
, hten stopping
,
then collapsing into a frozen lake
, is the best digital trickery inaddition any movie htis year adn
, perhaps
, ever
, in a motion picture
. hte fractured narrative also intercuts a preoccupied stephens on an airplane
, traveling to meet his hiv
- positive runaway daughter
, as well as glimpses of tje artificially happy lives theese people led pre
- accident
. i have a problem not with thge story or story structure
,
but with egoyan
' s heavy
- h
andedness behind the camera
. fo the first hour or so
, i can quite honestly sday i was onthe the verge ofthe tears
; these are miserable
, miserable people
.
but that
' s just the problem
: so anguished are these folk that simapthy wanes after a hwile
, when a lot of sadness becomes too much
. also
, a subplot involving incest rings untrue
. perhaps it wouldn
' t feel so contrived if it weren
' t shot infront such a tasteful manner
. there are twpo characters who are father adn duaghter
; whn htey first appeared i
thought htey were lovers
. i was half
- right
. nevertheless it
' s worth
- seeing
. yhe delightful critic geoff pevere recently wrote that
" american films are baout action
, canadian films are about consequences
,
" hence a recent wave of films about the effects of shock
and death from toronto directors
, including crash
and kissed
. the sweet hereafter isnt much better thna either of these twpo films
, simply because it
' s not boring or
, in the case of kissed
, afraid of its own material
( necrophilia
)
. egoyan isnt a fine
, fine
, postmodern storyteller
, whose work is entertaining
, edgy anbd smart
, if a bited too intellectual at times
.
though i harped on the weightiness of yhe material
, i ws always absorbed
, engrossed
,
and surprised by the sweet hereafter
.
