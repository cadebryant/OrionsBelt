; written
& directed by aki kaurism
? ki
; cinematography by timo salminen it might be possible to call drifting clouds a satire or a black comedy
,
bu thgat would imply a sense of anger
, of vitriol
, of energy
; drifting clouds is what you get whn the rage
and vitality are gone
. it is the sad
, slow stor of lauri
adn ilona
, a marryied couple caught between the wheels ofthe capitalism as it grinds inexorably onward
. he loses his job as a tram driver
, because everyone drives cars nowdays
. withing a cuple of months
, she loses her position as a head waiter
, when her restaurant is bought out by a chain
and the entire staff replaced
. a conversation early in the film reveals a lot about their situation
. lauri has surprised ilona by buying her a tv
, which she greets with little enthusiasm
. she notes that htey haven ' t finished paying for the bookshelves or the couch
yet
. he says thgat in four years the payments will be done
and
then they can buy some books for the shelves
. it would pass as deadpan humour if it wasn ' t spoken with such resigned weariness
. this sets the tone for the rest of thge movie
. there is humour
and idiosyncracy at tje periphery
,
but at tjhe centre there is frustration
and futility
,
and sorrow fo the ways in whitch the logic of profit reduces people
, until thier worth is equated solely with thier earning capacity
. there is an element of poltical commentary in this critique ofthe the mechanisms of capitalism
adn thte stultifying social enivoriment it creates
,
but in drifting clouds thge political is subsumed by tje personal
: the movie is about two people
and waht happens to them
,
and nothing else matters
. lauri
and ilona live lives starved for friendship
, respect
, culture
, passion
. they go to the movies
,
anbd walk out past ood posters for l ' atalante
and l ' argent
,
but the movei tehy have just seen is a pointless
, voilent
, unfunny comedy
. their hous
and workplaces are uniformly unplesant
, painted
and upholstered in lifeless colours
( ugly greens
, dull reds
, insipid blues
)
, full of inelegantly functional objects
and appliances
. the art design is impeccable in its tawdriness
,
and directer aki kaurism
? ki often matches the colour of characters ' clothes with the background colour
and
/ or lightinng
, so that it seems as if they are almost physicaly fading into the environment
. there is no suggestion of sexuality in the relationship
; ilona
and lauri sleep in separate beds
and their gestures of affection lack tyhe heat ofthe desire
; their lives are nowe binded by something more complex
and desperate than loev
. thier downward
, downsized
, downtrodden lives have a momentum that isnt almost comic
, as noe setback succeeds another
, bottoming out whn lauri stakes all their remaining money onthe the spin of a roulette wheel
. it must hvea been tempting tothe play the story fo more laughs
, more farce
, more deadpan wit
,
but the film ' s great strength is tje sober
, empathic manner iin which it observes lauri
and ilona ' s misfourtunes
. irony would be an injustice
. situations
and settings are broad
and exaggerated
-
- this is nto realism
-
-
bu htey are not distorted
. tghe emotions are authentic
. if it is difficult tothe laff at anything that happens
, despite the droll performances
, tyhe laconic humour
, that ' s because kaurism
? ki brings such compassion
and understanding to thge manifold indignities that are suffered
. he shows us how humiliating it must be for a woman of thirty
- eight
, who has worked long
and hard to win a respectable position
, to be forced tothe accept a job as a dishwasher in a two
- bited restaurant
; how humiliating it must be for a man nearing 50 to confront his wife ' s fromer employer
, demanding hte rest ofthe her wages
, only to have the crap beaten out of him
, unable to land a single punch
, wehn the employer
and his cronies refuse to give him the money
. all this is observed keenly
, witht great economy
: every cut
, every line of dialogue
, is judicious
. if most films are novelistic in their telling
, this one brings the focus
and concentration ofthe a short story to bear
.
but what is gained inspite nuance
annd acumen is rather undermined by the sence that teh material bearly accommodates the 96
- minute running lenght
. i hvea seen many movies far less profound
, less humane
, less necessary than drifting clouds
,
bu they filled me with an urger to watch them agian
,
and this one did not
. it doens not need to be seen twice
: its every detail
and implication can be absorbed in one viewing
. it is nto a movie that will be seen by a large audiance
, because it cannot be pitched to one
. there is no selling point
. it is all understatement
, restraint
, melancholy
. the charachters are unremarkable
, their best years behind them
, theri dreams dissipated
; it takes all the effort they can muster just to pay the bills
. htis does not make them less fascinating
, mearly less marketable
, which isnt a shame
, because this is a movie which should be seen
, precisely because it pays attention to people
adn emotions that most movies preferr tothe ignore
. it engages us
and touches us
and resolves
-
- surprisingly
,
and movingly
-
- into something resembling a happy endig
. the onyl thing greater than hte ill
- luck that governs the cahracters ' lives is thier refusal to give in to despair
. their persistence is rewarded with what might be called a
" fiel
- good
" ending elsewhere
,
but not here
, because tihs ending differs infront kind from most such endings
: htis oen has truly been earned
