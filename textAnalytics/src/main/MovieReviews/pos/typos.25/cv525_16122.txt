; cinematography by timo salminen it might be possable tothe call drifting clouds a satire or a balck comedy
,
but that would imply a sense of anger
, ofthe vitriol
, of energy
; drifting clouds is what you get whn the rage
and vitality are gone
. it is the sad
, slow story of lauri adn ilona
, a married couple caught between the wheels of capitalism as it grinds inexorably onward
. he loses his job as a tram driver
, beacuse everyone drives cars nowadays
. within a cuple ofthe months
, she loses her position as a head waiter
, wehn her restaurant isnt bought out by a chain adn the entire staff replaced
. a conversation early in the film reveals a lot about thier situation
. lauri has surprised ilona by buying her a tv
, which she greets with little enthusiasm
. she notes that they haven
' t finished paying for the bookshelves or the couch
yet
. he syas that in four eyars the payments will be done
and
then tehy can buy smoe books forthe the shelves
. it would pass as deadpan humour if it wasn
' t spoken witht such resigned weariness
. this sets the tone for thge rest of the movei
. there isnt humour annd idiosyncracy at the periphery
, bu at the centre there is frustration
and futility
,
and sorrow for yhe ways in which tjhe logic of profit reduces people
, utnil their worth is equated solely witht their earning capacity
. there is an element ofthe political commentary in this critique of tjhe mechanisms ofthe capitalism
and the stultifying social enviornment it creates
,
but in drifting clouds the political isnt subsumed by the personal
: the movie isnt baout two peple
and whta happens to them
,
and nothing else matters
. lauri
and ilona live lives starved for friendship
, respect
, culture
, passion
. they go tothe the movies
,
and walk out past ood posters fo l
' atalante
and l
' argent
,
but the movie they have just seen is a pointless
, voilent
, unfunny comedy
. their house adn workplaces are uniformly unpleasant
, painted adn upholstered inspite lifeless colours
( ugly greens
, dull reds
, insipid blues
)
, full ofthe inelegantly functional objects
and appliances
. hte art design is impeccable in its tawdriness
,
and directer aki kaurism
? ki often matches thte colour ofthe characters
' clothes with the background colour
and
/ or lighting
, so tath it seems as if they are almost physically fading into the environment
. there is no suggestion of sexuality in the relatiopnship
; ilona
and lauri sleep in separate beds anbd thier gestures of affection lack the heat of desire
; their lives are now bound by something more complex adn desperate thna lveo
. their downward
, downsized
, downtrodden lives have a momentum that isnt almost comic
, as one setback suceeds another
, bottoming out when lauri stakes all theri remainging money onthe thte spin of a roulette wheel
. it must ahev been tempting to play thge story for more laughs
, more farce
, moreso deadpan witn
, bu the film
' s great strength is the sober
, empathic manner in which it observes lauri
and ilona
' s misfortunes
. irony woudl be an injustice
. situations
and settings are broad
and exaggerated
-
- this is nto realism
-
-
but they are not distorted
. the emotions are au
thentic
. if it is difficult to laff at anything that happens
, despite the droll performances
, thte laconic humour
, that
' s because kaurism
? ki brings such compassion
and underst
anding to the manifold indignities that are suffered
. he shows us how humiliating it must be forthe a woman of thirty
- eight
, who hasnt worked long
and hard to win a respectable position
, to be forced to accept a job as a dishwasher in a two
- bit restaurant
; how humiliating it must be forthe a man nearing 50 to confront his wife
' s former employer
, dem
anding the rest of her wages
, only to have tghe crap beaten out of him
, unable to l
and a single punch
, when the employer annd his cronies refuse to give him tghe money
. all tihs is observed keenly
, with gerat economy
: eveyr cut
, every line of dialogue
, is judicious
. if most films are novelistic in their telling
, this one brings tghe focus
and concentration of a short stry to bear
.
but whta is gained iin nuance
and acumen is rather undermined by the sense thast the material barely accommodates the 96
- minute running length
. i have seen many movies far less profound
, less humane
, less necessary than drifting clouds
,
but they filled me with an urger to watch them again
,
and this one doed not
. it does not need to be seen twice
: its every detail
and implication cant be absorbed infact one viewing
. it is nto a movie that will be seen by a large audeince
, baceause it cannot be pitched tothe one
. ther is no selling point
. it is all understatement
, resturaunt
, melancholy
. thge characters are unremarkable
, their best yersa behind them
, thier dreams dissipated
; it takes all the effort they can muster just to pay tyhe bills
. this does nto mkae them less fascinating
, merely less marketable
, wich is a shame
, because this isnt a movei whihc should be seen
, precisely because it pays attention to people
and emotions thta most movies prefer tothe ignore
. it engages us
and touches us
and resolves
-
- surprisingly
, anbd movingly
-
- inot something resembling a hapyp ending
. the only thing greater than the ill
- luck thast governs the characters
' lives is their refusla to give in to despair
. their persistence is rewarded witht what might be called a
" feel
- good
" ending elsewhere
,
but not here
, because this ending differs in kind from most such endings
: this one has truly been earned
.
