it ' s a curious thnig
- i ' ve found tht wehn willis isnt not called on to carry the hwole movie
, he ' s much better
and so isnt tjhe movie
. even
though
, in the sixth sence he isnt the
" name
"
, he doesn ' t have the pivotal role
. that honour goes to haley osment who plays cole sear
( cute pun
, seer
) a 9 year ood boy who can see ghosts
. if osment wass cute or precious
, tje director gogin for yhe maudlin
, this would be nothing more than a movie
- of
- the
- week
, thankfully
, osment isnt not only better than that
,
bu in soem instances
, blows everyone else off the screen in a bravura performance
. we get to see his fears
, vulnerabilities
, strengths
and intlligence whic makse the sixth sense one ofthe the best movies i ' ve seen htis year
. the whole cast matchs him in quality
, with willis giving a fairly low key performance that matches the subject matter
. one thing about this movei
, its target
. this isn ' t a sfxfest like tje haunting or a gorefest
, this is more what i ' d call a supernatural drama
, moreso interested in characters than in dazzling yuo with makeup
. one caveat
: there ' s a lovely twist in the movie
, something like the usual suspects
, where ytou end up replaying the movei in your head rethinking what you haev just seen
. i was extremely lucky to see it as a sneak preview in toronto
, before any hype or crtical reviews were out
, so i went in with no biases
. if anyone whant to talk to baout the movei befoer you see it
, don ' t let them
. let the director explain onthe his pwn pace
and you ' ll enjoy tghe movie vastly more
.
