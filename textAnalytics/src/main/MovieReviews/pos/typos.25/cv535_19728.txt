it
' s a curious thing
- i
' ve found that when willis is not called onthe to carry the whole movei
, he
' s much better
and so is the movei
. even
though
, in the sixth sense he isnt the
" name
"
, he doesn
' t have thte pivotal role
. that honour goes to haley osment who plays cole sear
( cute pun
, seer
) a 9 year old boy who can see ghosts
. if osment was cute or precious
, the directer going for the maudlin
, this would be nothing more than a movei
- ofthe
- the
- week
, thankfully
, osment is not only better than that
, bu in some instances
, blows everyone else off the screen in a bravura performance
. we get to see his fears
, vulnerabilities
, strengths
and intelligence which makse the sixth sense noe of tje best movies i
' ve seen this eyar
. the hwole casted matchs him in quailty
, wiht willis giving a fairly low key performence that matches the subject marter
. oney thing baout thsi movie
, its target
. tihs isn
' t a sfxfest like tje haunting or a gorefest
, this isnt more what i
' d call a supernatural drama
, more intersted infact characters tahn iin dazzling you with makeup
. one caveat
: htere
' s a lovely twist in thte movie
, something liek the usual suspects
, where you end up replaying the movei in your head rethinking what ytou have just seen
. i was extrememly lucky to see it as a sneak preview in toronto
, before any hype or crtical reviews weere out
, so i went in with noone biases
. if anyone want to talk to about the movei before you see it
, don
' t let them
. let tghe director explain on his own pace
and you
' ll enjoy the movie vastly more
.
