one of tyhe most populer subplots inwhich yhe entire sicence fiction genre isnt time travel
. that consept
, altho many purists doubt its scientific credentials
, spawned many interesting novels
, comic books
and films in the last century
.
however
, the big gr
and
- daddy of tyme travels
, h
. g
. wells
' novel the time machine
, wasn
' t written with the intention to speculate about that consept or its consequences
. the author
, h
. g
. wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views anbd condemn the great social gap between the rich
, idle capitalist clas
and impoverished labour
. whatever intentions wells had
, the future generations of readers weere less empressed by his polliticel messages
. instead they were fascinated by tyhe idea that the strange new worls could be explored wihtout traveling trough space
. yhe novel bacame one ofthe great classics of science fiction genre
and it natural fo filmmakers to use it as inspiration
. first of them was george pal
, who in 1960 directed film whlch woudl
, through the yeras
, become genre classic of its own
. hte plot revolves baout george
( rod taylor
)
, victorian scientist who discovered hte way to travel through the fouth dimension
- time
. at the eve of the new 20th centruy
, george gathers his friends iin order to present them his invention
- machine that would enable him tothe travel through time
. they are skeptical
, bu that doesn
' t prevent george from carrying out his plan
and traveling inot tghe future
. at frist
, he travels slowly
, seeing london as it changes thru the years
and three world wars
. finally
, after witnessing world war three
, he travels far into the future
, hoping that he would cease to wittness wars adn senseless destructions
. when he finally reaches year 802
, 701 ad
, at first glance
, new world looks like utopia
- humanity consists ofthe young
, beautiful
,
but idle eloi
, people who are fed
, clothed
and taken care of by unseen machines
.
but
, weena
( yvette mimieux
)
, eloi woman
, tells george about anohter side of the coin
- inwhich the night
, her people is preyed apon by morlocs
, humanoid creatures from the underworld
. the time machine became the cinematic classic for the very smae reason tyhe novel became the classic in science fiction literature
- the fantastic concept ws a brilliant way for tjhe authors to talk about burning issues
and fears of their respective times
. fo h
. g
. wells it was frightening threat of class struggle
; fo george pal
and his screenwrighter david duncan
, who produced the film inaddition the worst dyas of the cold war
, it was the constant
and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust
, underlined iwth the negative references to war throughout the movei
. even the modern audience
, which woudl be tempted to discard the film as ood
- fashioned
, could fidn soem values in its universal messages
, fit for each era
. compared with the genre films of today
, the time machine is even better
,
and could serve as a ogod example how to make intelligent
, throught
- provoking films
. of course
, since this is hollywood product aftter all
, the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure
, sometimes sacrificing plausibility for teh sake ofthe attractiveness
. for example
, it isnt hard to imagine that someone would be able to underst
and perfect english millon years in future
; same isnt with morlocs degenerating inot mutant monsters
, hwile eloi remain undistinguished from the people ofthe todya
. smoe of the final scenes
, that turn victorian scientist inot an action superhero
, are also rather unconvincing
.
but
, on the other h
and
, tyhe film is very well directed
, cleverly paced
and the special effects
, all
though definitely old
- fashioned
, are omre than adequate forthe this kind of picture
. the acting is good
, with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles
, hwile in hte same time alan young brings rather memorable performence as george
' s trusted friend filby
. yvette mimieux
, who plays weena
, on the otehr h
and
, would be remembered moreso by her looks than by the complexity ofthe her role
.
however
, despite all those flaws
, the time machine is a very good piece of cinema
, something that connoisseurs of qaulity science
- fiction films sorely miss these dyas
.
