one ofthe the most populer subplots inaddition the entire sciece fiction genre isnt time travel
. that concept
,
although many purists doubt its scientific credentials
, spawned many interesting novels
, comic books
and films inspite the last centruy
.
however
, the big grand
- daddy of time travels
, h
. g
. wells ' novel the time machine
, wasn ' t written with tyhe intention to speculate about tyhat concept or its consequences
. the author
, h
. g
. wells mearly used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views
anbd condemn tjhe grat social gap between the rich
, idle capitalist clas
and impoverished labour
. whatever intentions wells had
, tjhe future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages
. instead they weere fascinated by the diea that the stange newyorker worlds could be explored without traveling trough space
. the novel became noe of great classics of science fiction genre
and it natural forthe filmmakers to use it as inspiration
. firt of them was george pal
, who in 1960 directed film which woudl
, through tje years
, become genre clasic of its own
. the plot revolves about george
( rod taylor
)
, victorian scientist who dicovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension
- timne
. at the eve of the new 20th century
, george gathers his friends infact order tothe present them his invention
- machine that woudl enable him to travel through time
. they are skeptical
,
but that doesn ' t prevent george from carrying out his plan
and traveling into the future
. at first
, he travels slowy
, seeing london as it changes through tghe years
anbd three world wars
. finally
, aftter witnessing world war three
, he travels far into teh future
, hoping that he would caese to witness wars
and senseless destructions
. whn he finally reaches year 802
, 701 ad
, at first glance
, newyorker world looks like utopia
- humanity consists of young
, beautiful
,
bu idle eloi
, people who are fed
, clothed
and taked care of by unseen machines
.
but
, weena
( yvette mimieux
)
, eloi woman
, tells george baout anyother side ofthe the coin
- in the nigt
, her people is preyed upon by morlocs
, humanoid creatures from the underworld
. the time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in sceince fiction literature
- the fantastic consept was a brilliant way for thge authors to talk about burning issues
and fears ofthe their respective times
. for h
. g
. wells it ws frightening threath of class struggle
; for george pal
anbd his screenwriter david duncan
, who produced tyhe film in the worst days ofthe thge cold war
, it was the constatn
and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust
, underlined with the negative references tothe war throughtout the movie
. even teh modern audience
, which would be tempted tothe discard the film as old
- fashioned
, could find some values in its universal messages
, fit for each era
. compaired with tyhe genre films of today
, the tyme machine is even better
,
and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent
, thougth
- provoking films
. of course
, sicne tihs isnt hollywood product after all
, the time machine delivers such concepts in the form ofthe classic adventure
, sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness
. for exmaple
, it is hard tothe imagine that someone woudl be able tothe understand perfect english millon yeasr in future
; same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters
, while eloi remain undistinguished from tghe people ofthe todya
. some of thge final scenes
, that turn victorian scientist inot an action superhero
, are also rather unconvincing
.
but
, on hte other hand
, the film is very well directed
, cleverly paced
and the special effects
,
although definatly old
- fashioned
, are more than adequate for this kind of picture
. the acting is good
, with rod taylor inaddition one of his most remembered roles
, while infront the same tiome alan young brings rether memorable performance as george ' s trusted friend filby
. yvette mimieux
, who plays weena
, onthe the other hand
, would be remembered more by her looks tahn by the complexity of her role
.
however
, dispite all thsoe flaws
, the time machine is a vyre ogod piece of cinema
, something that connoisseurs of quality science
- fiction films sorely miss these days
