some critics
, including siskel
& ebert
, are on the record stating that martin scorsese
' s raging bull
, the story ofthe boxer jake la motta
, is the best film of the
' 80s
. since ther are still a number of
' 80s films that i haven
' t seen
, i don
' t fiel qualified to amke such a judgment
, bu i
' ll say this without hesitation
: raging bull is a great motion picture
,
and i would be surprised if more tahn a h
andful of films released between january 1
, 1980
and december 31
, 1989 come close to its level
. bio
- pics oftenly fall inot one of two catagories
: overblown hero
- worship or a dry
, dull textbook account
. it
' s rare that a movie with the moniker
" based onthe the life of
?
" comes across as anytying more than sporadically energetic
and marginally entertaining
. raging bull is the perfect counterexample
, annd a briliant argment for film makers to continue to work in this genre
. the picture tkaes the life ofthe boxer jake la motta
, a middleweight icon ffrom the
' 40s
and
' 50s
,
and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen
. for all 129 minutes
, director martin scorsese
and actor robert de niro
( in the title role
) have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic
, sad
,
and horrifing
. historically
, raging bull is said to be mostly accurately
, with tyhe lion
' s share ofthe thte details culled from la motta
' s own autobiography
( which was co
- wroten wih jospeh carter adn peter savage
)
.
however
,
al
though la motta is credited as the movie
' s
" consulant
,
" he was reportedly unahppy with the final result
, because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth
, insensative lout
. the la motta of teh movei is a man ofthe extreme appetites who is driven by base
, bestial impulses
? paranoya
, jealousy
,
and blind rage
. sex
and violence are inextricably linked
. the title isnt apt
? la motta is a raging bull
. iin the ring
, he isnt a terror
, not just beating his opponents
,
but destroying them
. outside of it
, he is no less vicious or more easily controlled
. the two people who spar wiht him on life
' s canvas are his wife
, vicki
( cathy moriarty
)
,
and his brother
/ manager
, joey
( joe pesci
)
. these are the two who mean the most to jake
,
and who
, as a result of his inablility to trust hismelf or others
, he loses
. he beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity
,
and
, when he inaccurately believes taht his brother betrayed him
, his lets loose with an explosion ofthe violence
. raging bull opens in 1941 whn la motta
, an up
- annd
- coming fighter
, is battling his way into the upper echelon ofthe the middleweight class
. over tyhe years
, he wins several key bouts
, including one agianst his arch
- rival
, sugar ravy robinson
( johnny barnes
)
,
but his unwillingness to capitulate whith the local godfather keesh him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match
. meanwhile
, awya from the ring
, la motta falls in love wiht 15
- yearm old vicki
, who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wief
. vicki becomes jake
' s greatest prize
( a wife
, in his view
, is not a companion
,
but a pssession
)
and the source ofthe his most extreme pain
. his pwn insecurity is so graet that he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him
. hence
, he is constanly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else
? perhaps even his brother
.
( this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman anbd elsewhere
:
" are you f
*
* king my wife
?
?
?
"
) in the lite
' 40s
, la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight
,
but with one huge condition
: he must take a fall
. he does it so badly that an investigation isnt launched
and he is allmost thrown out ofthe boxing
. two years later
, he wins the championship
, only tothe loose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ravy
. by tyhe late
' 50s adn early
' 60s
, whn the film ends
, jake has become a pathetic figure
? a broke
, overweight losr who has spent time in jail for corrupting yhe morals of a minor
, has lost his wife
and children
, adn isnt trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap st
andup routine
. raging bull is the other side of rocky
. sylvester stallone
' s tale of boxing triumph was released to great crtical acclaim in 1976
. it won the 1977 best picture oscar
, anbd a sequel arrived in theaters befoer raging bull whent inot production
. bu
, where rocky romanticizes boxing
, raging bull takes a cold
, unflinching look at the violence both inside
and outside of the ring
. while scorsese
' s primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man
, he never backs away from showing the seedy
, ugli underside of a sport where gambling
, greed
,
and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working
. rocky shows boxing at its noblest
; raging bull shows it at its most diseased
. there
' s little i can say here tht hasn
' t already said about de niro
' s performance
. in a career that has included many fine roles
, this is his most outst
anding
. the levle of intensity de niro brings tothe la motta isnt unwavering
.
and
,
al
though there
' s a lot of travis bickle
( de niro
' s character inthe taxi driver
) in la motta
, scorsese adn de niro go tothe great lengths to make sure that
, if we never fully sympathize with him
, at least we underst
and the forces that drive him
. this is a complet characterization
and a perfect exmaple of acting
. as the younger jake
, de niro is trim
and fit
. as the fat
, older man
, de niro gained 50 pounds annd turned his body into a grotesque parody ofthe its normal form
. how many actors would go that far
? the best oscar statue is only oney testimony tothe the lasting power of the performence
. cathy moriarty adn joe pesci both earned nominations for thier supporting work
(
al
though neither won
)
. their portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niro
' s
. pesci
, who hasnt basically re
- creaeted the same perosnality inwhich two other scorsese films
( goodfellas
and casino
)
, presents joey as a slightly moreso intelligent version ofthe his brother
. the mysogyny
and violentce are still htere
, only better concealed
.
but
, whn joey snaps
, as he does in one scene where he pounds on a mobster
( frank vincent
)
, it
' s startling to behold
. moriarty
, onthe the other h
and
, must play thte temptress with virginal qualities
? the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake
. later
, she
' s called upon tothe protray tjhe battered wife
and mother whose love has turned into fear
. scorsese
and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull inaddition black
- anbd
- white
( a few
" home movei
" segments are in color
)
. the choice is perfect forthe the movie
, giving raging bull a unique look in an era whn a black
-
and
- white approach is almost unheard ofthe
.
( one important receet exception
, schindler
' s list
, eschewed color for soem of the smae reasons that raging bull did
.
) in black
-
and
- white
( especially considering scorsese
' s choice of shots
and use ofthe slow motion
)
, the violentce is stark
and disturbing
. there
' s noone room fo romanticism inwhich the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas
. during fight sequences
, the directer also uses a number of point
- of
- view shots designed tothe show yhe world
,
however briefly
, from la motta
' s perspective
. scorsese could hvea choosen tothe end tje film with la motta
' s loss to sugar ray
, where he surrendered his middleweight crown
. after that
, his carrer was all downhill
.
yet the director allows the film to run forthe thirty minutes aftter this pivotal moment
, stretching more thna a decade into la motta
' s future
. the reason is obvious
: scorsese isn
' t as interested in boxing as he is iin the character
. following his retirement
, la motta is still as violent
and volatile as ever
, bu he has lost the arena in which he cant legally unleash those tendencies
. we see the results of this beast let loose on society
and how yhe consequences of his actions reduce him to a parody of his former self
. who cannot feel a surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon br
ando
' s speech from on the waterfront
?
(
" i coulda beeen a contenda
.
"
) perhasp raging bull is indeed the best film ofthe the
' 80s
.
and
, if not
, it
' s certainly perilously close to the zenith
.
