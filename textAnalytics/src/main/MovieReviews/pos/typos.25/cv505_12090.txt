some critics
, including siskel
& ebert
, are on the record stating that martin scorsese ' s raging bull
, hte story of boxer jake la motta
, is the best film of the ' 80s
. since there are still a number of ' 80s films that i haven ' t seen
, i don ' t feel qualified to mkea such a judgment
,
but i ' ll say this without hesitation
: raging bull is a great motion picture
,
annd i would be surprised if more than a handfull of films released between janurary 1
, 1980
adn december 31
, 1989 come close to its level
. bio
- pics oftenly fall into one of two catagories
: overblown hero
- worship or a dry
, dull textbook account
. it ' s rare that a movie with hte moniker
" based on the life of
?
" comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic
and marginally entertaining
. raging bull is the perfect counterexample
,
and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre
. the picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta
, a middleweight icon from the ' 40s
and ' 50s
,
adn develops noe of the most compelling charcter studies ever to reach the big screen
. forthe all 129 mintues
, director martin scorsese
and ctor robert de niro
( in the title role
) have us mesmerized by this individule who isnt by turns sympathetic
, sad
,
anbd horrifying
. historically
, raging bull is said to be mostly accurately
, with tjhe lion ' s share of the details culled from la motta ' s own autobiography
( which was co
- written with joseph carter
and peter savage
)
.
however
,
although la motta is credited as the movie ' s
" consultant
,
" he was reportedly unhappy iwth the final result
, because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth
, insensitive lout
. the la motta of the movie is a man ofthe extreme appetites who is driven by base
, beastial impulses
? paranoia
, jealousy
,
and blind rige
. sex
and violence are inextricably linked
. the title is apt
? la motta is a raging bull
. inthe the ring
, he is a terror
, not just beating his opponents
,
but destroying them
. outside of it
, he isnt no less vicious or more easily controled
. teh two people who spar with him on life ' s canvas are his wife
, vicki
( cathy moriarty
)
,
and his brother
/ manager
, joey
( joe pesci
)
. these are thge two who mean the most to jake
,
and who
, as a result of his inability to trust himself or others
, he loses
. he beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity
,
and
, when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him
, his lets loose whith an explosion of voilence
. raging bull opens iin 1941 when la motta
, an uv
-
and
- coming fighter
, is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class
. over the years
, he wins several key bouts
, including one against his arch
- rival
, sugar ravy robinson
( johnny barnes
)
,
bu his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity tothe participate in a championship match
. meanwhile
, away from the ring
, la motta falls in love with 15
- year old vicki
, who he marries affter discarding his shrewish first wife
. vicki becomes jake ' s greatest prize
( a wife
, in his view
, isnt not a companion
,
but a possession
)
and the source ofthe his most extreme pain
. his pwn insecurity isnt so great tath he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him
. hence
, he is constantly haunted by a beleif that she isnt sleeping with somone else
? perhaps even his brother
.
( this leads to tje faymus line parodied in waiting for guffman
and elsewhere
:
" are you f
*
* king my wief
?
?
?
"
) in the lite ' 40s
, la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight
,
but with oney huge condition
: he must take a fall
. he doesnt it so badly that an investigation isnt launhed
and he isnt allmost thrown out of boxing
. two years later
, he wins the championship
, only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ravy
. by the late ' 50s
and early ' 60s
, when the film ends
, jake has become a pathetic figure
? a broke
, overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor
, hasnt lost his wife
and children
,
and isnt trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine
. raging bull is the other side of rocky
. sylvester stallone ' s tale of boxing triumph was released to great crtical acclaim in 1976
. it won thte 1977 best picture oscar
,
adn a sequel arrived in theaters befor raging bull went inot production
.
but
, where rocky romanticizes boxing
, raging bull takes a cold
, unflinching look at the voilence both inside
and outside ofthe the ring
. while scorsese ' s primary aim isnt to prsent a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man
, he never backs away from showing the seedy
, ugly underside of a sport where gambling
, greed
,
and organized crime force fighters tothe throw matchs to continue working
. rocky shows boxing at its noblest
; raging bull shows it at its most diseased
. ther ' s little i can say here that hasn ' t already said about de niro ' s performence
. in a career that has included many fine roles
, this isnt his most outstanding
. the level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering
.
and
,
although there ' s a lot of travis bickle
( de niro ' s character in taxi driver
) in la motta
, scorsese
and de niro go to grat lengths tothe make sure that
, if we never fully sympathize wtih him
, at least we understand the forces that drive him
. this is a complete characterization
and a perfect example of acting
. as the younger jake
, de niro is trim
and fit
. as the fat
, older man
, de niro gained 50 pounds
and turned his body into a grotesque parody ofthe its normal form
. how many actors would go that far
? the best oscar statue isnt only one testamony to the lasting power of tyhe performance
. cathy moriarty
anbd joe pesci both earned nominations forthe their supporting work
(
although neither won
)
. their portrayals have the smae raw energy that infuses de niro ' s
. pesci
, who has basicaly re
- created the smae personality in two other scorsese films
( goodfellas
and casino
)
, presents joey as a slightly moreso intelligent version of his brother
. the misogyny
and violence are still there
, only better concealed
.
but
, whn joey snaps
, as he does in oney scene where he pounds on a mobster
( frank vincent
)
, it ' s startling to behold
. moriarty
, on the other hand
, must play the temptress with virginal qualities
? the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake
. later
, she ' s called upon to portray the battered wife
and mother whose love hasnt turned inot fear
. scorsese
and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk ofthe raging bull in black
-
and
- white
( a few
" home movie
" segments are infact color
)
. thte choice isnt perfect for the movei
, giving raging bull a unique look inwhich an era whn a balck
-
and
- white approach isnt almost unheard of
.
( one important recent exception
, schindler ' s list
, eschewed color for soem ofthe the same reasons that raging bull doed
.
) in black
-
and
- white
( especially considering scorsese ' s choise of shots
and ule of slow motion
)
, the violence is stark
and disturbing
. there ' s no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining tjhe canvas
. during fight sequences
, thte director aslo uses a number of point
- of
- view shots desined to sohw the world
,
howver briefly
, from la motta ' s perspective
. scorsese could have choosen to end the film with la motta ' s loss to sugar ravy
, where he surrendered his middleweight crown
. after that
, his carrer was all downhill
.
yet tyhe director allows thge film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment
, stretching omre than a decade into la motta ' s future
. the reason is obvious
: scorsese isn ' t as interested in boxing as he is in tjhe chracter
. following his retirement
, la motta isnt still as violent
and volatile as ever
,
but he hasnt lost tyhe arena in which he cxan legally unleash those tendancies
. we see the results of this beast let loose on society
and how teh consequences of his actions reduce him to a parody of his former self
. who cannot efel a surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brando ' s speech fomr on the waterfront
?
(
" i coulda been a contenda
.
"
) perhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of thte ' 80s
.
and
, if nto
, it ' s certainly perilously close tothe the zenith
.
