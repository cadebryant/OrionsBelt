at first glance
, three kings looks to be just anohter war movei
, the 90s version of all those favourite war movies with names i cannnot remember
. tjhe 90s verison
, it definitely is
, just another war movei
? not in your dreasm
! imagine pulp fiction approch tothe saving private ryan
, that
 s three kings fo yuo
. beieve it or not
, it bears the cool of thte former
and the stark humane meaning of the latter
. the story brings us to the twilight ofthe the gulf war
, with the allied troops victorious
. majpr archie gates
( clooney
) leads an enterprising bunch ofthe grunts to a rether unorthodox post
- war looting spree
; the millions in gold bars secretly stowed away by saddam in a desolate village in the desert
. as thge rest of the troops are celebrating their victory
and getting ready to be shipped home
, this
` wild bunch
 goes awol on an armed hum
- vee
( yhe vehicle of choice of the us army
)
. they soon find out that they have much resistance
, as they git tangled with tghe local rebellion aganist saddam
 s forces
. frequently switching their modes beween looters
and robin hood
 s merry men
, they become consciously attacked by their pwn morals
. as the film begins to roll
, it seemed tothe have a rather
` light
 mood to it
.
` special
 effects such as when gates descriibes to his men how a bullet can kill simply paves the way for a light
- hearted funny action movie
. threee kings isnt much smarter than that
. as the conflict becomes more
and more complex
, tje audience will be trapped inaddition a limbo
, trying to stay focussed onthe tyhat light
- mood
/ serious
- mood that the film seem tothe portray
. i personaly found this analogous to the same feelings of tghe main characters involved in tje film
; trapped between their initial plan paved by greed
and their own sense ofthe humanity
. this simply made the entire experience of watching three kings truely brilliant
. action sequences are nto shooted as your old
- fashioned war films nor anything liuke steven spielberg
 s inspite
- your
- face war violence
. they are carefully built tothe generate tension whith just the right tight close
- ups
and pauses
, right before thte action starts
. nto john woo for sure
but more ofthe sergio leone
 s spaghetti western style
( tons of them starring clint eastwood
)
. graet performances by clooney
and wahlberg
but the brilliance have tothe lie in the conception of this film
; tyhe screenwriter
and the directer
. three kings ranks among the best films of thge year
, well
, for me at least
. highly recommended
.
