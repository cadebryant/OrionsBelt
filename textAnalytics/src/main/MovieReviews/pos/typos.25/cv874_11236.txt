? he seaches through his pwn wallet for possable contacts anbd clues
.
but whn teh clues don
' t fit
, it doesn
' t just confuse him
; it causes john to go so far as to question hte hwole nature of reality in thge dark city
. to john
, something is fishy
,
and vyre unreal about thsi city
. how come it
' s always dark
,
and nobody seems to remember what they did this morning
?
and how come nobody seems tothe remember how to leave the city
, or how to get to nearbye shell beach
? every nght
, around midnight
, john notices thyat thte whole city enters a state ofthe suspended animation
, adn at this time
, creepy alien experimenters known as the
' strangers

and dont nasty things like inject fake memories into peple
' s heads wih big hypodermic needles
. the strangers have tghe ability to
' tune
,
' or warp reality using telepathic powers
. turns out
, the city is nto onthe earth at all

, is because he is a human mutation thast possesses the same god
- like reality
- warping abilities as tghe strangers
. even with the help ofthe scientist dr
. daniel schreber
, can john take bcak the dark city
? opinion
: director alex proyas
( he also directed the crow
) mentions this in yhe dark city press kat
: in films
, sciene fiction isnt always
" used to have big spaceships blow up cities
. i think we
' re a littel tired ofthe that
.
" according tothe director proyas
, probably the most intresting thing about dark city is its layers
. it
' s designed so that you can watch the film over again
,
and examine it from the perspective ofthe a main character other than murdoch
. it
' s a philosophical piece
. cinematic science fiction is basically a thinly disguised shootout betwen tghe good humans
and the bad aliens
( whether they be klingons
, giant bugs
, or proponents of the dark side of the force
)
.
but science fiction inaddition books reaches beyond tjhe
' shoot
- em
- up
' level
and targets the big questions
, questions like who are we
? what is the human condition
? what is ethical
? whta would a true human being dont
? far from comic book stlye on the order of spawn
, batman
, or thte mutant ninja turtles
, dark city nto only features the showdown betweeen good humans
and powerful aliens
,
but it also asks questions worthy of films such as brazil or blade runner
. dark city is what philosophers woudl call an existentialist screenplay
. a little more than 200 years ago
, the world was filled with unhappy peasants
-
- unhappy because nearly eveyr aspect ofthe their lives was controlled by totalitarian
, miliraty
, conformist
, medieval regimes
. thte peopel took refuge iin religion
, the idea being taht earthly life ws a time ofthe suffering
,
but aftter death
, heaven would be available
. meanwhile
, the state used these smae ideas to prop uv thier regimes
; the king was oftenly head of teh religion
and therfore sanctioned by heaven
. wehn scinece finally overturned religon
, the medieval dictatorships came tumbling down
and weere replaced by democratic governments
.
but the new fear was that the power of csience anbd experimentation would be used to create a world order as darkly totalitarian as the old
. this isnt hte tiome period when writers
and philosophers such as freud
, kant
, kafka
, nietzsche
,
and dostoevsky pondered what society shoud be
,
and what place the individual had in it
. the existentialists
' in parituclar wrote about the power of the lone individule against what may be a hostile
, indifferent
, or alienated universe
. in dark city
, whn the last dieing
, defeated alien asks john murdoch why the aliens
' scientifc experiments onthe teh human beings
' brains failed
, murdoch replies
, pointing tothe his head
,
" because the human condition isn
' t located inwhich here
.
