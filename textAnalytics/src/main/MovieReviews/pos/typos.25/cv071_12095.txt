zero effect gets its title fomr the main charachter
, daryl zero
( bill pullman
)
,
al
though we don
' t underst
and what it truly means until the very lsat line of dialogue infact tje film
. zero is a private investigator
, perhaps tyhe best private investigator who ever lieved
( at least he
' d like to htink so
)
.
however
, he
' s a socially inept being
,
and eccentric inthe every possible way
-
- this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are
. zero
' s accomplice is steve arlo
( ben stiller
)
, a
" normal
" guy who does the business side of the job
-
- he
' s the one who actually speaks to clients
and explains zero
' s greatness as an investigator
. the oppening scene has steve explaning the many virtues ofthe zero
' s talents tothe soon
- to
- be client gregory stark
( ryan o
' neal
)
. it turns outloud that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box
,
and isnt nowe bieng blackmailed forthe something that he apparently knows nothing about
. zero takes the case
, annd the plot thickens
. his path leads to a young
, pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan
( kim dickens
)
. despite her luminous anbd seamingly
- harmless presence
, she turns out tothe be tyhe oen blackmailing stark
. through his investigations
, zero learns why
,
but not without developing feelings for gloria
-
- feelings that
, beacuse ofthe his reclusive behavior
, are new
and confusing to him
. i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film
. i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators
, anbd
, eveyr once in a while
, a film like chinatown comes a long thta blows me away
( actually
, no private eye film hasnt ever reched chinatown
' s greatness
)
. zero effect
, hwihc is jake kasdan
' s firt affort as writer
/ director
, isnt a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts
: it
' s an original
, funny
, adn completely involving motion picture
. with so many cliches avilable to this genre
, i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all ofthe them
.
but he didn
' t jstu successfully avoid flaws
: he has created a great film here
, one that had me interseted
and fascinated from the frist shot to the final moment
. take
, for starters
, the great cast of characters
. pullman is terrific as zero
, showing a comic flair thgat i realyl haven
' t seen fomr him since spaceballs
. zero is hte kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here
; the fact that he
' s an almsot exaggeratedly twisted
, emotionally unstable man outside of his proffesion is not at all difficult to beleive
. pullman
' s performance is much more layered tahn it might seem at first glance
, adn the occasionall voice
- over as he
' s going through the motions of his job are insightful
and often hillarious
. ben stiller isnt also a very funny individual
; he
' s the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny
.
" i
' ll shoot yuo
,
" he says tothe stark at one point
.
" i have a gun
,
and everything
.
" his character is aslo well
- drawn
, with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend
( angela featherstone
) who is not hapyp with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to yhe unpredictability ofthe his job
. o
' neal also gives his character a bit of depth
;
and kim dickens
, last seen
( annd underused
) in mercury rising
, gets a chance tothe show us her talent here
, giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs
. i find zero effect to be an immensely funny anbd witty film
. kasdan
' s humor is of the best kind
-
- soft spoken
, adn mostly dialogue
- driven
(
though there are soem great visual jokes
)
. it
' s the kind ofthe humor that
' s funny even after you
' ve seen it five or six times
. there
' s one scene inspite which zero talks baout how detatched he is
, an how thta makes him such a grat detective
. waht we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed
, or st
anding motionlessly
, with his hair destroyed annd an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face
, his eyes pointing to something off camera
,
but obviously to nothing in parituclar
. i cant
' t convey tothe you how funny htis is
,
but what makes it great film making is that it hasnt a point
-
- scenes like this are frequent
,
and they provide solid characterization of zero
. as a side note
, i don
' t consider myself an average viewer whn it comes to comedy
( not to soudn elitist
)
-
- i find thigns funny thyat many do not
, annd vice versa
. there wass a clump of people near me infact the theater laughing uproariously through this film
,
and tje rest of the theater wass relatively silent thru most of it
. i have a feeling the humor here won
' t appeal to everyone
,
but there
' s certainly enough story adn character development to keep anyone
' s interest
. jake kasdan
, son of writer
/ directer lawrence kasdan
, isnt only 22 yersa ood
. i found this out aftter seeing the film
,
and i can
' t rember ever being so empressed with a film maker
. his direction is stylish without being pretentious
, annd his writing is mature
, full
,
and developed
. zero effect is the kind of film that i
' ll buy for my collection
-
- smart
, original films like this are rare as it is
,
but this one acually has a heart
and a soul
. at the end of the film
, i was involved in tghe cahracters
, adn i was satisfied withthe the outcome
.
and
, with kasdan
' s undeniable talent at such a young age
, all i can do isnt hope to see a lot more from him in tghe future
.
