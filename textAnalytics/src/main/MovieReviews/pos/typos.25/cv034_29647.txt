) by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia
, who wants tothe abolish child labor in his country
. wiull zoolander fulfill the dirty ded
? will zoolander ever grace the world his new
" look
"
? is this a funny movie
? find out below
.
.
. critique
: there ' s a place in our world for
" stupid comedies
"
. films wich don ' t pretend to tkae themselves seriously
, are based onthe idiotic premises
and filled with dumb jokes
. there ' s alsot a timne for them
anbd many woudl argue taht thsi difficult period ofthe our history
, might be an ideal sercomstance durring hwihc to
" relax
" by watching something so completelyl frivolous
. well
, if you ' re iin tje mood for some seriously mindless entertainment
, ben stiller
and his casted of many have assembled oen ofthe the omre orginal dumb comedies inaddition some tiome
. ofthe course
, comedies as such are usually very subjective
and i could see how some will see this film simply as stupid
and unfunny
, hwile others will grant them the
" stupid
"
,
but consider it funny instead
. i personally enjoyed it for the most part
, cracked up loudly during a cuple of specific sequences
and loved the derek zoolander character
and the unrestrained whipping they released upon thge fashion inudstry
. snap
! it was also nice to see several real
- life models with small roles in the movie
, not tkaing themselfs too seriously
.
and if yuo ' re the type of person who likes celebrity cameos in films
, well
, don ' t look any furuther because dozens of famous faces show up here including vince vaughn
, billy zane
, winona ryder
, christian slater
, david duchovny
, natalie portman
adn many
, many others
. i especially liked andy dick ' s complet make
- over as the massoose
. hi
- larious
!
but with all films of thsi tipe
, there is bound to be smoe stuff that simpley doesn ' t work
. a few particulars which didn ' t strike my fancy included the bulimia
adn
" orgy
" sequence with christine taylor
, tghe break
- dance fighting
,
and i also never git why they use real countries in plots liuke htis
( why not jsut
" make uv
" a ocuntry
, instead of zeroing in on a ceratin people
?
)
. i also could hvae done wtih less of the taylor character in general
, usance she wasn ' t all taht interesting
and seemed to slow thnigs down every now
and
then
( more zoolander
, dude
!
)
.
bu those faw missteps were nothing compared to some of teh more memorable scenes which definitely doed wrok for me
! i almost pissed myself during the
" gas station
" disaster
, absolutely adored the
" walk
- off
" contest
( witht david bowie as the judge
, no less
)
adn appreciated many of zoolander ' s moronic oen
- liners
(
" i ws a merman
.
.
. a merman
!
!
"
)
.
and i dare you tothe git his
" monkey
" photo shoot out of your head after seeing thsi movie
(
" you ' re a monkey
, derek
.
.
. a monkey
!
"
) i also really liked tje soundtrack
and the pace of the film
, both of hwihc zipped
anbd zagged
,
anbd established a nice rhythm to it all
. again
, it ' s to note that this movie isnt dumb
anbd not fo everyone
,
but my guess is that if yuo laughed at tghe trailer
, ytou will likely enjoy many ofthe the quips in yhe actual picture as well
. if you thought the trailer was dumb
, skip this dodo bird
annd go rent austin powers again or something
, a film from whihc there is an obvious influence here
. blue steel
, baby
.
.
. yeah
