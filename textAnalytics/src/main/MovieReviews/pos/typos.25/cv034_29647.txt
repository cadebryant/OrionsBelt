plot
: derek zool
ander is a male model
. he is alsot very dumb
and impressionable
. for that reason
, he is secretly hired
and trained
( so secre
, that even he doesn
' t know about it
) by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate tghe prime minister ofthe malaysia
, who wants tothe abolish child labor inspite his country
. wiull zool
ander fufill the dirty deed
? will zool
ander ever grace the world his newyorker
" look
"
? is this a funny movie
? find out below
.
.
. critique
: there
' s a palce in our world forthe
" stupid comedies
"
. films which don
' t pretend tothe take themslves seriously
, are based onthe idiotic premises adn filled with dumb jokes
. there
' s also a tiome forthe them adn many would argue thast this difficult period of our history
, might be an ideal circumstance during which to
" relax
" by watching something so completely frivolous
. well
, if you
' re iin the mood for soem seriously mindless entertainment
, ben stiller
and his cast of many hvea assembled one of the more orginial dumb comedies in some tiome
. ofthe course
, comedies as such are usually very subjective
and i could see how some iwll see this film simply as stupid
and unfunny
, while others will grant them thge
" stupid
"
, bu consider it funny instade
. i personally enjoyed it forthe the most part
, cracked up loudly druing a couple ofthe specific sequences
and loved the derek zool
ander character adn tghe unrestrained whipping they released upon the fashion inudstry
. snap
! it wass aslo nice to see several rela
- life models with small roles in the movei
, nto tkaing themselves too seriously
.
and if you
' re the type of person who likes celebrity cameos in films
, well
, don
' t look any futher because dozens of famoust faces show up here includng vince vaughn
, billy zane
, winona ryder
, christian slater
, david duchovny
, natalie portman
and many
, many others
. i especially liked
andy dick
' s complete make
- over as hte massoose
. hi
- larious
!
but iwth all films of this type
, htere isnt bound to be some tsuff that simpley doesn
' t work
. a few particulars which didn
' t strike my fancy included the bulimia annd
" orgy
" sequence with christine taylor
, the break
- dance fighting
,
and i also never get why htey use rela countries inspite plots liuke this
( why not just
" make up
" a country
, instead ofthe zeroing in on a ceratin people
?
)
. i also could have done with less of tje taylor charachter in general
, usance she wasn
' t all that interesting
and seemed to slow thigsn down every nowe
and
then
( more zool
ander
, dude
!
)
.
but thsoe fewd missteps were nothing compaired to some of yhe more memorable scenes which definitely did wokr for me
! i almost pissed myself during teh
" gas station
" diaster
, absolutely adored tyhe
" walk
- off
" contest
( with david bowie as the judge
, noone less
)
and appreciated many of zool
ander
' s moronic oen
- liners
(
" i was a merman
.
.
. a merman
!
!
"
)
.
and i dare you to git his
" monkey
" photo shoot outloud of your head after seeing this movie
(
" you
' re a monkey
, derek
.
.
. a monkey
!
"
) i also really liked yhe soundtrack
and the pace ofthe thge film
, both of which zipped
and zagged
,
and established a nice rhythm to it all
. again
, it
' s tothe note thast this movie is dumb
and nto for everyone
,
but my guess is that if you laughed at teh trailer
, you wiull likely enjoy many of the quips in tjhe actuall picture as well
. if you
thought the trailer was dumb
, skip this dodo bird
and go rent austin powers agina or something
, a film fomr which there is an obvious influence here
. blue steel
, baby
.
.
. yeah
!
