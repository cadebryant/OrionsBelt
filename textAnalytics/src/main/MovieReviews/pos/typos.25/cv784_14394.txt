it
' s no secret in the motion picture industry thgat the relationship between a script
and the actors involved often mkaes or breaks a movei at the box office
. a poorly
- written script can be bested by a superb acting corps
,
and a well
- written piece can be mangled by a group of amateurs
. in directing his latest action
- comedy
, director brett ratner
( money talks
) takes a relatively medioker piece of st
andup comedy
and turns it into a funny as all get
- out buddy cop movie
. in addition
, rush hour serves as a first
- class example of directing a movie with conservitive atitude
- a feature that is sure to draw in crowds ofthe all types
. thge two lead names share equal screen time here
, mostly beacuse they spend it toghether
. jackie chan
, in his firt completely american production
, makse an impressive de
but by mixing dialogue with martial arts
. hte other martial arts flick from a few weeks ago
, knock off
, st
ands noone chance against the content of this one
. chan manages tothe make every fight scene exude grace annd poise
,
and there
' s noone doubt tath a large precentage ofthe video sales for this movie will come fomr viewers who couldn
' t believe theri eyes the first time
. chris tucker
, on the opposite side
, relates a hilarious comedic approach which smoothes out the rough edges to chan
' s performance
. he works perfectly with the script
,
and it
' s quite likely he lent scribe jim kouf a h
and with soem of his lines
. almost essential to the action genre
, tjhe plot isnt nonexistent
. we
' re quickly itnroduced to detective james carter
( tucker
) is a maverick officer for tje lapd
. cut foward tothe another scene where the daughter
( julia hsu
) of the american chineese consul
( tzi ma
) is kidnapped by a gang ofthe swarthy characters
. the fbi isnt quick to the rescue
,
but the consul insists that one ofthe his men
, detective inspector lee
( chan
)
, be brang onthe the case to halp
. tje fbi resists
, bu
then requests that lapd send a man over tothe babysit the chinese detective
. it
' s here that carter
and lee hook uv
,
and the two unwittingly solve the case while the fbi rushes in to back them up
. rattner doesnt a fine job of oging the extra mile to get his movie to move a step up
,
but it doesn
' t qtuie triarch the top tier of action
- comedies liek lastr eyar
' s grosse pointe blank
. there are moments where the plot strays too far off tje straight line it sticks almost exculsivly to
, annd if nto for the commedic interactions between tucker
and chan
, this might be a major drawback
. also
, some supporting characters are alomst entirely allong forthe the ride
,
and others are there simply to look menacing
.
however
, none gives a st
andoffish performance
and they mostly mesh into the background
. almost eveyr memeber ofthe the cast displays smoe reservation at one point or anohter
- whther it
' s tucker
' s toned
- down routine or chan
' s tight rein on his action sequences
- anbd that contri
butes greatly to thsi being a watchable movie for all types
. a recommendable visit tothe the theather
, indeed
