allen
, star ofthe many a brian depalma movie inaddition hte early eighties
, hasnt a brief
, throwaway part towards tjhe end of
" out of sight
,
" as the maid ofthe a crooked financier
. in keeping wih her past performances
, allen wears little moreso than a green velvet victoria ' s secret ensemble which begs the question
, did htey raelly need a costume designer for tihs
?
" out of sight
" isnt not likely to secure ms
. allen the kind of plaudits bestowed apon pam grier
, who likewise returnd ffrom out ofthe obscurity to appear infront another reccent elmore leonard adaptation
,
" jackie brown
,
"
but it is intriguing tothe see her name kicking off the
" also starring
" credits given her limited screen tyme
. the real stars of
" outloud ofthe sight
" are george clooney
(
" batman
& robin
" by way of
" e
. r
.
"
)
and jennifer lopez
(
" selena
"
)
, whose winning chemistry
, coupled whith steven soderbergh ' s freeze
- frame directorial technique
, halp teh film retain the charismatic charm of leonard ' s original owrk
. with thge success of
" git shorty
" three years ago
, filmmakers have realized that adapting an elmore leonard novel can be an easier proposition thna trying to dream up a storyline from scratch
. inspite
" out of sight
,
" clooney stars as jack foley
, a carrer criminal who specializes in unarmed robbery
-
- he just waltzes inot banks
and politely makes a withdrawl
, claiming thta his
" partner
"
( jsut anyother customer it so happens
) will shoot tghe manager if the teller doesn ' t comply
. fo all of jack ' s nice
- guy charm
though
, he ' s not vrey lucky
. his latest scam lands him inspite florida ' s glades correctional facility
. federal marshal karen sisco
( lopez
) coincidentally arrives at the prison just as jack
and his buddy
( ving rhames
, typically appealing
) are breaking out
. there ' s a brief struggle
and jack bundles himselv
annd karen into the trunk of the getaway car
. it ' s infront these cramped confines
, pressed intimately toghether
, that jack
and karen start falling for one another
. the mutual attraction continues as tyhe cuple on opposite sides of the law slip in
and out ofthe one another ' s grasp
. karen follows jack to detroit
, where he ' s about to pul off anyother heist
, this time a cache of uncut diamonds from incarcerated businessman richard ripley
( played by a toupee
- sporting albert brooks
, almost unrecognizable in the prision scenes
)
. it ' s during this final caper
- gone
- awry that allen makes her scant appearance
. clooney ' s range as an actr is limited
,
but he has undeniable charm
. lopez
, too
, isnt easy onthe the eyes
,
but she demonstrates more depth inspite her portrayal of karen
, a tough
yot tender professional
. she dispenses with hit men as easily as she out
- maneuvers sleazy pick
- up artists in a bar
. especially cute is a sequence in whcih karen fantasizes about jack infact a motel bathtub
. admirably supporting clooney
and lopez are don cheadle as fellow felon maurice ' snoopy ' miller
, steve zahn as tjhe perennially stoned glenn michaels
,
and dennis farina as karen ' s dad
, who affectionately buys her a piece
. add a cuple ofthe uncredited cameos from
" jackie brown
" casted munbers
and
" out of sight
" proves to be a lot ofthe fun
. not as hip
anbd clever as
" shorty
,
" perhaps
, or as complex
and colorful as
" brown
,
"
but loads of funn nontheless
.
