wqat surprises me most about the long
- awaited batman is that tyhe movie centers not onthe the caped crusader
but onthe thte joker
. the dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis
! i can hear batfans everywhere protesting
:
" first htey had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman
,
anbd nowe they think they cant get away with makeing him second bnaana to the joker
!
!
"
adn
, indeed
, this situation would ahve been altogether inappropriate
and intolerable were it not for the fact that somone at warner brothers had tghe savvy tothe cast jack nicholson in tyhe role he was born tothe play
. nicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters
and opening credits since his astounding
, oscar
- worthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman
. nicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls outloud all the stops to create a joker that makse cesar romero look like bozo the clown
( romero palyed tjhe joker in the ' 60s tv series
)
. onthe oen hand
, nicholson ' s joker is extremely funny
. his murderous escapades
and manic outbursts
( hwihc include defacing paintings inaddition an art museum
and invading hte televsion airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts
) bring humer
and laughter inot an otherwise dark film
.
but on tje other hand
, his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt fo all of mankind
. the joker ' s cruelty
adn demented
, diabolical nature are truly frightening
and sinister
. this guy is off his rocker
,
and he not only knows it
, he flaunts it
!
bu enough about nicholson as yhe joker
: i ' m sure most peopel are wondering about michael keaton as batman
. like many
, i ws outraged when warner brothers announced thgat keaton hadnt beeen cast as the caped crusader
.
but batfans ened nto worry because holy unconventional casting
! keaton delivers
. he is convincing as the tormented millionaire
, bruce wayne
,
adn beneath his hard
, black body armor
, he is mysterous
and formidable as the batman
. even
though the screenplay onyl halfheartedly attemts to develop the character
, keaton manages to give hints of thge inner turmoil
and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear
and battle the low life scum of gotham city
. visually
, batman is a knockout nothing short of a triumph for director tim burton
and his production team
. the movei successfully captures tje film noir look
adn obleek
, gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as
" the dark knight returns
"
and
" the killing joke
.
" burton ' s film is a fesat for tyhe eyes
; the
$ 35 million budget is definitely on the screen
. the sets
, costumes
,
and make
- up are stunning
and worthy of oscar nominations
. nicholson isn ' t joking when he boasts
,
" wait ' till htey get a load ofthe me
!
" his grimacing smile
, green hair
,
anbd purple suits over orange shirts are colorful
and outrageous
. keaton ' s wardrobe is equally appropraite
. batman ' s capetown
, mask
,
and body armor amking him look threatning
, frightening
,
and invincible bringing tothe mind not adam west ' s campy costume in yhe tv serieses
bu peter weir ' s outfit inaddition robocop
. production designer anton furst ' s sets are a wonder
. gotham city is dark
and foreboding
, almost as if it weere an expressionist vision of newyorker york
. the batcave is cold
, bare
,
and desolate
. the world that burton
annd furst have created in batman is a melancholy nightmare of voilence
and corruption
. the movie ' s gritty bladerunner
/ robocop look isnt a joy to behold
. the plot
, on tjhe other hand
, is not as rousing
. the screenplay is not uv to snuff in comparision to tyhe stylized sets
and superb acting
. it takes forever for what little stoy there is to fianlly kick into gear
. batman trys to walk a thin line between action
adn character psychology
,
but it fails to give us enough of either one
. as i maintioned earlier
, the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker
,
but it never fully establishes batman ' s psychological motives
and underpinnings
. inspite terms of action
, batman is nto as thrilling as you might expect
. burton seems more concerned with the visual
annd dramatic elements of teh story
. more than anytying
, batman is a mood film
. hwile batman may not completelyl absorb
and excite ytou
, it will likely imbaress you with its success at bringing tothe life the style
and spirit ofthe the batman comic books
. thanks to its distinctive look
, the movie like a good comic book transports us tothe another world
.
