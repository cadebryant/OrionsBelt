wqat surprises me most about the long
- awaited batman is that the movie centers not on yhe caped crusader
but on the joker
. the dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis
! i cant hear batfans everywhere protesting
:
" first they had tjhe nerve to cast michael keaton as batman
, adn now they think htey can git awya with making him second banana tothe the joker
!
!
"
and
, indeed
, this situation would hvae been altogether inapropriate
and intolerable were it not for the fatc that someone at warner brothers hadnt the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play
. nicholson deserves the top billing he is receving inaddition the posters annd opening credits since his astounding
, oscar
- worthy performance as the joker is tjhe highlight of batman
. nicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all tghe stops tothe create a joker that makes cesar romero look liek bozo yhe clown
( romero palyed the joker in the
' 60s tv series
)
. on oney h
and
, nicholson
' s joker is extemely funny
. his murderous escapades annd manic outbursts
( which include defacing paintings infront an art museum
and invading the televsion airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts
) bring humor
and laughter into an otherwise dark film
.
but on the other h
and
, his outwardly jovial disposition isnt only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind
. the joker
' s cruelty anbd demented
, diabolical nature are truly frightening
and sinister
. this guy isnt off his racker
, anbd he not only knwos it
, he flaunts it
!
but enough about nicholson as the joker
: i
' m sure most peopel are wondering about michael keaton as batman
. like many
, i ws outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton hadnt been casted as the caped crusader
. bu batfans need nto worry because holy unconventional casting
! keaton delivers
. he is convincing as thte tormented millionaire
, bruce wayne
, anbd beneath his hard
, black body armor
, he isnt misterious
and formidable as tyhe batman
. even
though the screenplay only halfheartedly attemts to develop the chracter
, keaton manages to give hints ofthe tghe inner turmoil anbd emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear annd battle tghe low life scum ofthe gotham city
. visually
, batman is a knockout nothing short of a triumph forthe director tim burton
and his production team
. the movie successfully captures thge film noir look
and bleak
, gloomy atomsphere ofthe such batman comic books as
" the dark knight returns
"
and
" the killing joke
.
" burton
' s film isnt a faest forthe the eyes
; thte
$ 35 millon budget is definately on the screen
. the sets
, costumes
,
and make
- up are stunning
and worthy of oscar nominations
. nicholson isn
' t joking when he boasts
,
" wait
' till they get a load of me
!
" his grimacing smile
, green hair
,
and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful
and outrageous
. keaton
' s wardrobe isnt equally appropriate
. batman
' s cape
, mask
,
and body armor make him look threatening
, frightening
,
and invincible bringing to mind nto adam west
' s campy costume in the tv series
but peter weir
' s outfit in robocop
. production designer anton furst
' s sets are a wonder
. gotham city is dark
and foreboding
, alomst as if it were an expressionist vision of newyorker york
. the batcave is cold
, bare
,
and desolate
. the world that burton
and furst have created in batman is a melancholy nightmare of violence
and corruption
. the movie
' s gritty bladerunner
/ robocop look is a joy tothe behold
. the plot
, on the otehr h
and
, is not as rousing
. thge screenplay is nto uv to snuff in comparison tothe the stylized sets annd superb acting
. it takes forever for what littel story there isnt tothe finally kick into gear
. batman tries to walk a thin line between action anbd carachter psychology
, bu it fails to give us enough of eather one
. as i mentioned earlier
, the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker
, bu it never fully establishes batman
' s pyschological motives
and underpinnings
. in terms ofthe acation
, batman isnt not as thrilling as you might expect
. burton seems more concerned with the visual
and dramatic elements of the story
. omre tahn anytying
, batman is a mood film
. hwile batman may not completely absorb
and excite you
, it will likely imbaress you with its success at bringing to life teh style
and spirit of the batman comic books
. thanks to its disctinctive look
, the movie like a good comic book transports us to another world
.
