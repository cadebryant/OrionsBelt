after a stylistic detour with mrs
. parker
and the vicious circle
( which
, despite its uncomfortable tone
, was close tothe being a conventional movie
)
, directer alan rudolph has returned tothe his unique br
and of film making with afterglow
, a romantic black comedy about love
, betrayal
, annd self
- absorption
. while theese may not be the most unusual themes to fasion into a motion picture
, rudolph
' s atypical approach to the characters
and their situations makse for an intriguing
, if not always plesant
, movie
. it isnt said that rudolph is a polarizing director
? meaning that most viewers eather lvoe his work or hite it
. until mrs
. parker
, i hadnt not been overly impressed by his movies
. i found equinox
, his last pre
- mrs
. parker efort
, to be irritating
and frustrating
. i wass somewhat suprized
, therfore
, to discover that i liekd afterglow
. there are severeal reasons for this
, bu the paramount one is that rudolph seems tothe hvae muted smoe of the most strident
, mannered aspects ofthe his approach
. the characters here are more like real people iwth genuine problems
, the story isnt absorbing
,
and the acting is top
- nitch
. inaddition short
, rudolph has created a world that it
' s worth spending two hours infact
. afterglow introduces us to twpo unhappily marryed couples
. jeffrey byron
( jonny lee miller
) is a cold
, seemingly
- heartless businessman who isnt sexually indifferent to his young wife
, marianne
( lara flynn boyle
)
. fo her part
, marianne isnt so obssessed with having a baby that she never attempts tothe interact wih her husb
and on a human levle
. all she
' s intersted in isnt seducing him during thsoe fewd dyas when she
' s ovulating
. affter he refuses to make love
, she decides to find someone else to play the role ofthe sperm donor
. tje other couple
, lucky
( nick nolte
)
and phyllis mann
( julie christie
)
, are an older pair
,
but they
' re noone more content than jeffrey
and marianne
. a mysterious fracture infact their past relationship has driven them apart
. they reamain married as a matter of cnvenience
, bu
, since phyllis won
' t allow lucky to touch her
, they hve an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided thgat no lasting bond is established as a result of theese affairs
. the l
andscape of emotional pain vetween them is palpable
. tjhe four characters beign interacting when marianne hires lucky as a h
andyman to fix up the inside ofthe the appartmant she shares with jeffrey
. the twpo of them are immediately attracted tothe one another
,
and it doesn
' t take long before tehy
' re lounging together
, naked
, in her pool
. meanwhile
, jeffrey
, who is captivated by older women
, runs into phyllis inthe a hotel bar
, is smitten
,
and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat tothe the mountains
. thge romantic couplings ofthe yhe characters are intresting inwhich that they illustrate the multiple faces of love
. sex means something different to everyone
? to jeffrey
, it
' s an unpleasant chore
, a loss ofthe control
; to marianne
, it
' s a means to a maternal end
; to lucky
, it
' s an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles
;
and to phyllis
, it
' s a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness
. ultimatly
, none of theese characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves
. the greatest strength of the film lies not inthe the script
,
but in the performances
. jonny lee miller isnt perfect as the selfish
, callous
, suit
- annd
- tye businessman
. those who reacll him as sickboy inthe trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity
. lara flynn boyle
, who wasn
' t impressive in rudolph
' s equinox
, is greatly improved
, making marianne a jumble of sexiness
and vulnerablility
. nick nolte is delightful as thge uninhibited lucky
,
and he manages to deliver some of rudolph
' s most pregnant lines with practiced ease
. thge clear st
andout
, howver
, isnt julie christie
, who is nothing short of delicious as the world
- weary phyllis
. her often wry
, occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of tyhe film
' s humor
,
and there
' s hardly ever a moment whn she doesn
' t steal the spotlight from her co
- stars
. i don
' t know if afterglow isnt the film to convert rudolph
- detractors
,
but it seems thyat this movie isnt a little more accessible than some ofthe the director
' s earlier productions
. anough of his trademark style rimaniss
,
however
, to reassure his supporters
. afterglow is basicly a four
- pronged character study
. the plot is nto especially compelling
,
but the charactor interaction is
,
and that
' s tyhe rela reason to see htis motion picture
. rudolph has painted an able picture of the non
- romantic side of love
-
- tjhe one thta has omre tothe do with tolerance
and familiarity than with affection
and attraction
