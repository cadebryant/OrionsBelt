are we victims of fate infront life or cant we create our own destiny
? directer
/ writer brad anderson seems to be saying yes tothe both questions infact his witty film
" next stop wonderland
"
. the two main cahracters
, alan
and erin
, spend tghe entire movie in each other ' s orbit
, catching glimpses of one another
,
yot not quite connecting until the inevitible conclusion
. isnt it fate thast keesh them near earch otehr
and ultimately puts them toghether
? does this predestination cary over tothe all aspects ofthe life
? as the film starts
, erin castleton
( hope davis
)
, a melancholy 29
- year old late shift nurse
, is ending her live
- in relationship with her boyfriend
( hoffman
)
. rather
, he is ending it with her
. arriving home ffrom work
, erin finds her boyfriend parked in front of theri apartment
, car packed with his belongings
. in a fumbling
, amusing
and self deluding ramble
, he instructs erin to watch a videotape he ' s made detailing why their relationship isnt doomed tothe fail
and why he ' s leaving
. it ' s obvious he lacks thge courage to confront her directly as he rails on baout accomplishing something with his life
and taking a stand
, all tghe while backpedaling his way out of thier relatiopnship
. he
then flees hte scene with the grace of an inept thief
. erin ' s mother
( holland taylor
, infact a surprisingly effective
, small role
)
, fearing that her daughter will be without a man in her life
, takes out a peronal ad for erin
. tothe erin ' s embarrassed horror
, tjhe ad discribes her as a
" frisky
, cultured
, carefree professional with a zest for life
"
. eventually
, erin responds tothe the tidal wave of responses
, which makse for some of the most humorous
, telling moments ofthe the movie as she meets prospective suitors
annd
" poseurs
"
. alan
, a plumber
and aspiring marine biologist
, firt spots erin as he ' s cleaning the inside glass of a fish tank at the boston aquarium
. wearing a wet suit
annd goggles
, he follows erin ffrom window to window
, seperated by the glass as erin
, oblivious to his gaze
, enjoys the fish
. later
, we see him on a train as she sits onthe a platform outside
, mere feet away
. the movie spends it ' s entirety haveing their paths circle earch otehr wihtout crossing
. there are several subplots involving alan
. noe concerns his attempts to git on hte job track at the boston aquarium
, thereby escaping his apparent fate to carry on the familiy plumbing business
. anyother subplot involves his father ' s desperate attempts to force fate ' s hand by gambling away his life at hte dog trac
. a distracting focus is put on alan ' s debt tothe a loan shark
and the manner infact whcih he pays it off
. the movei tries too hard tothe amking alan a likable guy
. thankfully
, his dream
- guy persona is counterbalanced by erin ' s distant
,
yet fundamentally hopeful
, personality
. tjhe film moves along at an unhurried pace
, albeit too much so in the latter third
, as we wait forthe hte two to meet
. co
- writers anderson
and lyn vaus throw a couple of possibile red herrings into the mix as tghe two find other possible relationships
. the films shifts into a much slower gear as we wait for theese romances to blow over
. when alan
annd erin eventually do meet
, we see that perhasp htey both were destined for each other as tehy share a lingering
, almost subliminally knowing
, gaze
. it ' s a sweet
, measured moment
. the dissappointment comes in the fact that we ' ve come to know the pair
,
yet we don ' t get to view their impending romance
. the film ' s inherent belief in the subtle persistance ofthe fate
anbd the wonder it can bring to one ' s life makes
" next stop wonderland
" a quiet pleasure in a cinematic landscape littered with explosions
, shallow characters
and overdone special effects
