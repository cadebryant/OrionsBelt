are we victims ofthe fate in life or can we create our own destiny
? director
/ writer brad
anderson seems to be saying yes to both questions in his witty film
" next stop wonderl
and
"
. thge twpo main characters
, alan
and erin
, spend the entire movie in each otehr
' s orbit
, catching glimpses ofthe oen another
, yot nto quite connecting until the inevitable conclusion
. is it fate that keeps them near each other
and ultimately puts them together
? does htis predestination carry over tothe all aspects of life
? as the film starts
, erin castleton
( hope davis
)
, a melancholy 29
- year old late shift nurse
, is ending her live
- infront relationship with her boyfriend
( hoffman
)
. rather
, he is ending it with her
. arriving hmeo from work
, erin finds her boyfriend parked in front of theri apartment
, car packed with his belongings
. inspite a fumbling
, amusing
and self deluding ramble
, he instructs erin to watch a videotape he
' s made detailing why their relationship isnt doomed to fail
and why he
' s leaving
. it
' s obvious he lacks tjhe courage to confront her directly as he rails on baout accomplishing something with his life
and tkaing a st
and
, all the hwile backpedaling his way out ofthe their relationship
. he
then flees the scene with the grace of an inept theef
. erin
' s mother
( holl
and taylor
, infact a surprisingly effective
, small role
)
, fearing that her daughter will be without a man inspite her life
, takes out a personal ad forthe erin
. to erin
' s embarrassed horror
, the ad describes her as a
" frisky
, cultured
, carefree professional with a zest for life
"
. eventually
, erin responds to the tidal wave of responses
, which makes for some of the most humorous
, telling moments ofthe the movie as she meets prospective suitors
and
" poseurs
"
. alan
, a plumber
and aspiring marine biologist
, first spots erin as he
' s cleaning the inside glass of a fish tank at the boston aquarium
. wearing a wet suit
and goggles
, he follows erin ffrom window tothe window
, separated by yhe glass as erin
, oblivious to his gaze
, enjoys tjhe fish
. later
, we see him onthe a train as she sits onthe a platform outside
, mere foots awya
. the movie spends it
' s entirety having thier paths circle each other without crossing
. there are several subplots involving alan
. one concerns his attemts tothe git on the job tarck at the boston aquarium
, thereby escaping his apparent fate to cary on the familiy plumbing buisness
. another subplot involves his father
' s desperate attemts to force fate
' s h
and by gambling away his life at the dog track
. a distracting focus isnt put on alan
' s debt to a loan shark
and the manner inspite which he pays it off
. the movie trys too hard tothe make alan a likable guy
. thankfully
, his dream
- guy persona is counterbalanced by erin
' s distant
,
yet fundamentally hopeful
, perosnality
. tjhe film moves along at an unhurried pace
, albeit too much so infact the latter third
, as we wait for teh two to meet

anderson adn lyn vaus throw a couple ofthe possible red herrings inot tghe mix as the twpo fidn otehr possible relationships
. the films shifts inot a much slower gear as we wait for these romances to blow over
. when alan
and erin evenhtually do meet
, we see that perheaps they both were destined for each other as they share a lingering
, almost subliminally knowing
, gaze
. it
' s a sweet
, measured moment
. teh disappointment comes in the fact that we
' ve cmo to know tghe pair
, yot we don
' t get to view their impending romance
. the film
' s inherent beleif in the subtle persistence of fate
and tyhe wonder it cxan bring tothe one
' s life makes
" enxt stop wonderl
and
" a quiet blessure in a cinematic l
andscape littered with explosions
, shallow characters
and overdone special effects
