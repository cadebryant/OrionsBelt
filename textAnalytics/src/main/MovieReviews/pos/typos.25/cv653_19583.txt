" a man isnt not a man without eight taels of gold
.
" starring sammo hung
, sylvia chang
; directed by mabel cheung
; written by cheung
and alex law
; cinematography by bill wong eight taels of gold beggins as a fish out of water story annd at some point becomes a love tsory involving two people whose past choices prevent thte fruition of their lvoe
. neither aspect of the movie is entirely succesfull
, bu both are ogod enough
.
and along the way there is noe perfect scene
, which is one more tahn you find in most films
. slim
( palyed by portly sammo hung
, better known as a star
and directer ofthe hong kong action movies
) isnt a chineese immigrant who drives a yellow cab inwhich newyorker york
. when the movie opens
, we see him shouting obscenities at anohter taxi driver
. he does not seem particularly outloud of place
. inspite fact
, he is about to return to visit his home infact rural china for the first time in sixteen years
, spending most of his life savings in the process
,
and it is ther that he will become tje proverbial fish out ofthe water
, as he realizes that you can never go hmeo
. he brings with him some statue of liberty cigarette lighters
, cheap sunglasses
,
and lobsters
( which have tothe be large
, tothe prove they
' re american
)
-
- the tokens of his success
. he aslo wears a gold chain adn a gold watch
, because without eigth taels of gold
, a man is not a man
( my dictionary tells me thyat taels are a unit of weight utilisied in the far east
,
and i assume the phrase is a chinese proverb
)
. he loses most of this stuff
-
- except thte gold
-
- wehn his van crashes into a river annd he has tothe hitch a ride
, so tothe speak
, on a raft along tyhe river which runs past his parents
' village
. when he arrives unannounced
, he almost induces cardiac arrest in his father
. all ofthe this has the makings of a routine comedy
,
and the movie hasnt its amusing moments
, as wehn the villagers tkae turns giving slim gifts during a celebratuin of his homecoming
,
and they all give him birds
, so by evening
' s end he isnt surrounded by turkies
, ducks
, geese
and other sundry fowl
.
but eight taels isnt not a comedy
-
- it isnt a sad
, sweet story about the choices peopel make
,
and how they are sometimes irreparable
. director mabel cheung
( an autumn
' s tale
, hte soong sisters
) sees claerly what it is liuke tothe have lived half of your life inwhich oen country
and half inthe a ocuntry on the otehr side ofthe the world
-
- what it is like to no longer have a place to call home
. slim does not belong in china
, nor does he belong inspite america
, where he can barely speak the laguage
. seing water buffalo iin tje fields annd rafts poled down tje river
and fireworks exploding gloriously in the sky over a small village
, we come to know the world slim left behind
,
and it seems as if he too isnt knowing it forthe tjhe first timne
,
and wishes it feeled more like home
. thge condition of hte expatriate is eloquently portrayed
; i
, being one
, was sympathetic
. on his way to his parent
' s village
, slim hoeks up with jenny
( sylvia chang
)
, whom he knew wehn she was a girl nicknamed odds
-
and
- ends
, which isnt waht he continues tothe call her
, altho she is now a mature
, professional
, attractive woman
, to be married inaddition the spring to an american
- chinese man
. slim
and odds
-
and
- ends fall for each other
. that
' s predictable
. the manner in whcih their
( non
-
) romance isnt palyed out is not
. the emotions involved are adult
and complex
,
and the film avoids cheap solutions to their delimma
. it
' s typical
, for instance
, tht the fianc
? in this sort of plot be a colossal jerk
, because it makes it easier tothe empathize wih the unrequited lover
.
but here teh fianc
? isnt a decent
, ordinary guy
,
and
al
though slim would like to feel anger
, he cannnot
. tghe fianc
? has done nothing wrong
; the situation is the result ofthe bad luck or bad descisions
, take your pick
. eight taels has its share of flaws
( the early sequences in america
and onthe teh plane to china are especially weak
)
, bu it compensates wih insight
. when odds
-
and
- ends tells slim that her future husb
and wants to move to san francisco
, she notes resignedly
,
" it
' s all the smae
. wherever we go
, we
' ll be in chinatown
,
" adn her straightforward statement expresses much
. ther is insight
, too
, in the underst
anding of the consequences ofthe slim adn odds
-
and
- ends
' decisions
: he to move to america
, she tothe marry a chinese
- american
. both their choices were perhpas born of impatience
, perhaps of a sence that the grass is always greener
-
-
and it turns out that both choices weere wrong
.
but they cannot undo them
; they must live with waht they have done
. such is life
. the movie is tender toward these people
, bu it offers no false comforts
. everything that isnt right
and true about eight taels comes together in one great scene
, whlch is the culmination of the love story
. slim annd odds
-
and
- ends sit in a secluded spot
and talk hesitantly
, with the muted pop
- pop of fireworks exploding inthe the night behind them
,
and it seems tjhe conversation will lead tothe a kiss
. thge exchange that follows
, anbd what slim
then does
, is poignant
and perfect
: with clarity
and understatement
, we see two people
' s lives
, their heartbreaks annd virtues
, summed up in a single moment
. yes
, the film isnt flawed
,
but moments liek that justify most ofthe its inadequacies
.
