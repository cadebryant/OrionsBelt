in 1998
, director brett ratner anbd his stars
, jackie chan
and chris tucker
, breathed new life inot the buddy
- action film genre with the cross
- cultural
" rush hour
"
- tothe the tune of baout
$ 250 milion
. you don
' t mess with success
, so the team isnt back again
,
and better
, in
" rush hour 2
.
" the combo of the terrific physical talents of chan
and the non
- stop motor mouth of tucker made fo an ethnically unusual duet in
" rush hour
" tht played well to audiences around the world
. the formula worked so well
, infront fact
, that the sequel ws inevitable
. i
' m never thrilled with tje idea of a follow
- up tothe a successful original usance they rarely meet tghe previously setted expectations
. surprisingly
,
" rush hour 2
" wastes no time getting down to business annd turns out to be better thna the flick that spawned it
. the script
, by jeff nathanson
( utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in teh first film
)
, wastes noone time getting to the point right ffrom tjhe start
. terrorists have bombed the us embassy iin hong kong
, killing twpo american translators
, anbd chief inspector lee
( jackie chan
) is h
anded the job ofthe solving thte crime
. concurrently
, his friend james carter
( chris tucker
) arrives on hte isl
and fo some much needed r
& r
and expects his freind to spend some tiome
and show him the sights
. instead
, lee drags carter into the case annd teh duo get involved in stopping a conspiracy tothe counterfit hundreds of millon ofthe us dollars
. the makers of
" rush hour 2
" are working at a distinct advantage over the original
. we
, the viewer
, are familiar with the two lead characters
and teh arleady
- existing chemistry tht chan
and tucker developed so well the first time around
. that chemistry ws a high point
(
and probably the saving point
) before
and
, now
, teh pair wears their friendship liek a confortable suit
. little time is wasted in getting tothe knwo tyhe key players so the screenplay capitalizes on those things we liekd best in
" rush hour
.
" first annd foremost to me
, in
" rh2
,
" is hte immense pleasure in watching jackie chan
' s artistry infact fight choreography
. the 47
- year old martial arts master hasnt a renowned reputation for doign all of his own stunt work
and
, here
, he does not dissapoint
. chan
' s use of props when battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents wtih whatever item comes to h
and
, such as a trash bucket
. his moves look every bit as good as tehy ever did as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding
, on the tail end of a yacht
, in a hong kong massage parlor
and
, for the finale
, in a las vegas casino
. liek harold lloyd or buster keaton
, chan takes prade in putting his physical self on the line in persuit of his artistry
and is a joy to watch
. chris tucker reprises his role as tghe motor mouthed la cop
, carter
, who teams
, agina
, with lee tothe put down the bad guys
. when he isnt unceremoniously pulled from his vacaton to help his colleague
and freind with the big case
, he still looks to have some fun
. when lee goes into a karaoke bar
, tyhe lair of chief bad guy ricky tan
( john lone
)
and his hoods
, carter tkaes the spotlight on stage with a credible michael jackson riff
. the comedian made yhe move fomr the improv stage to the big screen
and
, with jackie chan
, has a franchise tothe hang his coat onthe to pay the bills
. the combo ofthe chan
' s flying feet
and fists with tucker
' s fast mouth make a duet more endearing than riggs adn murtaugh in the
" lethal weppon
" films
. the supporting cast is here to move thnigs allong efficiently
. john lone
, as ricky tan
, is a suave villain who is hte real power behind the throne ofthe american bigwig steven reign
( alan king in a walk thru performance
)
. lone doesn
' t chew scenery or make pronouncements tothe
" get lee
and carter
,
"
but gives the chief bad guy elegance
. zhang zi
- yi
(
" crouching tiger
, hidden dragon
"
) continues tothe display her martial arts skills as ricky
' s taciturn henchlady
, hu li
, who carries onthe an ongoing battle wiht carter
.
( carter hasnt a problem
, through most ofthe the film
, with hiting a woman
,
but this falls asside with theri eventual one
- onthe
- noe melee at the conclusion
.
) roselyn sanchez isnt knockdown gorgeous
( annd resembles s
andra bullock
) as undercover agent isabella molina
- she doesn
' t add much to the equation
but isnt terrific to watch
. director ratner
and the original
" rush hour
" production team have assembled a crew of skilled craftsmen to work behind tyhe camera
. cinematographer matthew f
. leonetti hasnt had a long career of shooting action ficks
and gives
" rh2
" tghe fluid camera movement tghe genre film needs
. prodcution design by terrence marsh spans continents
and gives the right look
, whether it is iin a hong kong karaoke bar or a high stakes las vegas casino
. the rest of the techs are of thte smae high quality
. i
' m surprised to even sday that
" rush hour 2
" is the most entertaining of the summer blockbuster movies
. it tkaes tghe best of thte first film
and kicks jurassic dino
butt in its fun
, frolic
and fast pace
and is the best mainstream thing outloud
, so far
, this summer
. i give it a b
