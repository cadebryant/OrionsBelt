on tyhe basis of this film alone
, i never would have predicted taht
, in two years
, quentin tarantino woudl become the country ' s biggest hotshot director
. reservoir dogs has hints of the tarantino brilliance that emerged in pulp fiction
,
but is a much less substantive
, more conventional crime story than the big pf
. here ' s what thge two movies do have in common
.
.
.
-
- scenes of intelligent
, amusing dialogue with noone relevance to the plot
-
- a stoy that jumps back
and forth in tiem rather than going in a logical
, chronological sequence
-
- graphic
yet necessary violence
-
- an engaging crime story
-
- dialogue liberally spiced with swear words
and racial
/ gender slurs
-
- three ofthe the same actors
( harvey keitel
, tim roth
and steve buscemi
)
-
- a mexican standoff ending
, altho this noe is considerably less optimistic than pf reservoir dogs is an entire hour shorter than pulp fiction because it ' s only got one story tothe tell rether than three
. crime lord joe cabot
( vetran actor lawrence tierney
) has assembled five criminals who hvea never even met each otehr tothe pull a diamond store heist
. the five are instructed not to reveal their real names or personal details or anything tjhe cops could use if one of them was captured
adn interrogated
. instade
, tehy are all given code names off the color chart
-
- mr
. white
( keitel
)
, mr
. pink
( buscemi
)
, mr
. orange
( roth
)
, mr
. blonde
( michael madsen
)
, mr
. brown
( tarantino
)
and mr
. peach
( tarantino ' s chin
)
. most ofthe the movie ' s runing time is spended wih mr
. white
and pink waiting at a warehouse fo tje others to arrive
. mr
. orange
, meanwhile
, is on the floor
, dying fomr a gunshot wound
. hte polical hadnt arrived at the scene ofthe hte crime way too soon
, leading white to believe noe ofthe tje five was an informant
. the story ' s background unfolds through a sories ofthe flashbacks
, of the crime itself
and the meetings between joe
and tje criminals prior tothe the crime
. eventually
, blonde arrives with a polical officer hostage
,
and what follows is a truly brutal
, uncomfortable torture scene
. let ' s jstu sday picasso owudl be inpsired by what blonde does tothe the cop ' s ear
. a lot of thge time
, reservoir dogs seems like your typical gangster heist
- gone
- wrong movei
,
but there are a few sequences that are uniquely tarantino
. the opening scene in the coffee shop starts thte movei off on a high onot the rest of it doesn ' t live up tothe
, as the criminals plus joe have a conversation on
, among other thigsn
, tipping philosophies
and their interpretations of madonna ' s
" like a virgin
.
" another scene involves roth ' s lengthy manufacturedd stoy about running into a group ofthe cops
and a police dog in a bus station bathroom while carrying a giant bag of marijuana
. neither of these ahev much plot relevence
but are given ample time to develop
, like the captain koons gold watch speech in pulp fiction
, only here theese sequences are more enjoyable thna the rest of the movei
. reservor dogs is ogod
but it ' s no pulp fiction
.
