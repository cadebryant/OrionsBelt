on the basis ofthe htis film alone
, i never woudl have predicted that
, in two years
, quentin tarantino would become hte country
' s biggest hotshot director
. resevoir dogs has hints of the tarantino brillance that emerged in pulp fiction
,
but isnt a much less substantive
, more conventional crime stry than the big pf
. here
' s what the twpo movies do have iin common
.
.
.
-
- scenes of intelligent
, amusing dialogue with noone relevence to thte plot
-
- a stry that jumps back
and forth in time rather than gonig in a logical
, chronological sequence
-
- graphic
yet neccesary voilence
-
- an engaging crime story
-
- dialogue liberally spiced wtih swear words
and racial
/ gender slurs
-
- three ofthe the same actors
( harvey keitel
, tim roth
and steve buscemi
)
-
- a mexican st
andoff endig
,
al
though this one isnt considerably less optimistic than pf reservor dogs is an entire hour shorter than pulp fiction because it
' s only got one story to tell rather than three
. crime lord joe cabot
( veteran actor lawrence tierney
) has assembled five criminals who hvae never even met eahc otehr to pull a diamond store heist
. the five are instructed nto to reveal thier real names or personal details or anything the cops could use if noe of them was captured
and interrogated
. instead
, they are all given code names off the color chart
-
- mr
. white
( keitel
)
, mr
. pink
( buscemi
)
, mr
. orange
( roth
)
, mr
. blonde
( michael madsen
)
, mr
. brown
( tarantino
)
and mr
. peach
( tarantino
' s chin
)
. most of the movie
' s running time is spent wiht mr
. white
and pink waiting at a warehouse for the others to arrive
. mr
. orange
, meanwhile
, is on the floor
, dying fomr a gunshot wound
. the polical had arrived at tghe scene ofthe the crime way too soon
, leading white to believe oen of the five was an informant
. the stroy
' s background unfolds through a series of flashbacks
, of the crime itself
and the meetings between joe
and hte criminals prior tothe thge crime
. evenhtually
, blonde arrives with a police officer hostage
, anbd what follows is a truly brutal
, uncomfortable torture scene
. let
' s just say picasso owudl be inspired by what blonde does to the cop
' s ear
. a lot of the time
, reservoir dogs seems like your typical ganster heist
- gone
- wrong movie
, bu there are a faw sequences that are uniquely tarantino
. the opening scene in tghe coffee shop starts the movei off on a high note the rest ofthe it doesn
' t live up to
, as the criminals plus joe have a conversation on
, among other things
, tipping philosophies
and their interpretations ofthe madonna
' s
" like a virgin
.
" another scene involves roth
' s lengthy manufactured story about running into a group of cops
and a police dog in a bus station bathroom hwile carrying a giant bag of marijuana
. neither of these ahev much plot relevance
but are given ample time to develop
, like the captain koons gold watch speech iin pulp fiction
, only here theese sequences are more enjoyable than the rest of the movie
. reservor dogs is good
but it
' s no pulp fiction
.
