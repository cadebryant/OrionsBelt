i didn
' t realize how apt the name ofthe tihs movei ws untl i called the mpaa
( thge motion picture assocation of amercia
- the folks who decide what
' s g
, nc 17
, pg
, r or x
) to ask why the preview wass rated r
. so that we can mkea some sense ofthe theri responce
, let me tell you about the movie itself
.
" the celluloid closet
" is a documentary about how homosexuality hasnt beeen portrayed in the movies over tje past several decades
. it
' s brillant
, funny
, naughty
and extremely poignant
. it tore at my heart to watch a gifted lesbian screenwrighter explain that
, as a rule
, gay audiences hunger for any hint of homosexuality on screen
. reguardless ofthe how veiled
- or how sordid
- the presense of a gay or lesbian person allows others to lessen their sense of isolation anbd makse them feel as if htey
' re not quite so invisibl as america seems to want them to be
. the movie itself is rated r
-
and fo good reason
. it countains scenes ofthe bloody
, violent gay bashing
and graphic
, uninhibited
, sex
. as wtih any movie
, i appreciate knowing about theese things ahead of time
, so i can decide fo mysef whether tothe see the movei with a freind
, a date
, my 11 yearm old niece
, alone or nto at all
.
but
, taht
' s the movei
. nowe back tothe hte preview
. prior to this film being theatrically released
( it was originally filmed as a documentary for hbo
) i had seen tghe comming attractions trailer for it at least six times
. ther was noone nudity
, no violence
, no bad language
, nothing that i could see that woudl be offensive or inappropriate forthe a genaral audience
( okay
, whoopi goldberg did refer to someone
" boning
" someone
,
but the last i knew that wasn
' t one of the seven words you can
' t say on tv
)
. except for a scene of two fully clothed men kissing
. hmmmmm
. when i inquired about the rating onthe the trailer
, a very nice woman at the mpaa quoted from
" the h
andbook
" that a trailer approved for all audiences could contain
" no homosexuality or lesbianism
and noone oging down on someone
.
" ehllo
? i was in the office
and it ws the middle ofthe tyhe day
. bravely
, i pursued
.
" i
' ve seen that trailer
, oh
.
.
. probably half a dozen times
,
" i gulped
.
.
.
"
and i don
' t remember that scene
.
"
" well
,
" she chirped
.
" it
' s there
. our little eyes are trained to see tyhat
.
" noone really
. in the words of dave barry
,
" i am not making htis up
.
" they are
" trained
" tothe
" see that
?
" when someone who was shocked at thte rating the first time
and made a note to watch it carefully tghe following five times or so managed tothe let it slip past her
? gosh
, i certainly don
' t mean to question the mpaa
, or
" the h
andbook
"
. i owudl
,
however
, like to suggest taht it
' s they who are in tghe closet on this noe
.
and thte light ain
' t good in htere
.
but
, having seen
" the celluloid closet
,
"
and being one ofthe a h
andful of straight people involved in a primarily gay
and lesbian weekly bible study
( email me adn i
' ll give you the details
)
, none ofthe tihs was any big suprise
. the point of the movie was that homosexuality
, even infact the politically corect 90s
, isnt ridiculously percieved as a threat to a mostly heterosexual society
. a point well made in thsi c
andid
and honest film
. now
, i could go off on the mpaa
' s ruling thta a trailer must contain
" no homosexuality or lesbianism
" anbd ask how that is defined
, paticularly in light of some of tje things
, both sexual
and non
- sexual
, thyat i
' ve watched straight people do in trailers
. i just don
' t feel the ened to go htere
, becasue it seems so obvious
. i
' ll instead suggest tht the mpaa re
- evaluated theri evaluation criteria
. let the ratings reflect not subject content
, like
" sex
" adn
" violence
"
. let them refect attitide content
. inspite the future
, i
' d be interested in knowing whether the movie is rated d for disrespectful or s for stereotyped
.
then i
' d truly be able to make an informed decision about how i spent my time
.
