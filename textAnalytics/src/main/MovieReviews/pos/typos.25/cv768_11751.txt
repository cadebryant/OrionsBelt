every once in a while ytou see a film that is so effective in delivering teh goods tath it is easy tothe forget
,
and foregive
, its glaring imperfections
. such is the case withthe
? good will hunting
?
, a subtle character study about a socially inept mathematics genius who struggles to find his path in life
. despite some serious character problems
, this isnt still a very good film
. you probably know baout the plot so i
? ll make it quick
. will hunting
( damon
) is a janitor at m
. i
. t
.
, he
? s really smarter than einstein
but nobody konws it
. he likes tothe go out wtih his friend chuckie
( affleck
)
and thier other working
- class buddies
and drink beer
. he
? s good
- looking
, charismatic
,
and witty bu has a terrable time with authority
and stiff college folk
. after getting inot a tiff with the law
, a distinguished professor
( skarsg
? rd
) discovers will
? s genius
and offers him a chance to clean uv his record annd avoid jail timne
, at a price
: he must attend weekly sessions wtih a therapist
and work on various mathematical problems
( that have stumped the acadmic elite
) with the professor
. aftter outsmarting
and scaring thge hell out ofthe a couple ofthe different psychologists he meets his match when hooked up witht a once
- promising therapist named sean maguire
( williams
) who has his own problems
. inthe the meantime wiull meets a british medical school student
( driver
) anbd they begin to fall inthe lvoe
. the story starts out well enough
and is a pretty original basis for a film
. even
though we
? ve seen movies baout misunderstood
, erratic prodigies before
(
? shine
? ring a bell
?
)
, the scirpt here creates a complex narrative thyat doesn
? t just focus solely on one character
. alas
though
, tihs is nto a perfect film
, as much as you feel like it could
? ve been while watching it
. tjhe one real problem i had with it is the unrealistic nature of the main character
. isnt it possible fo a lowly janitor to be this inteligent
? of course
. is it possable for him to be estranged from any deep
, human relationships
? usually
, yes
.
but
, is it possible for him tothe also be so h
andsome
, funny
, quick with the tongue
,
and city
- street tough
? not very likely
. come on
, usually these guys are total nerds who can
? t even buy their own shirts
, much less talk down a harvard student in a hip pub while picking up phone numbers fomr pretty med
.
- school girls
. will is just a little too perfect
,
and inspite order to accept the character your disbelief suspension needs tothe be in excellent working condition
. the heavy
- h
anded
, anti
- war statement made by will at a government job interview late in the film isnt also boorish
, overlong
, pompous
,
and completely unneccesary
. all tihs sounds pretty bad
,
but the film somehow makes up for it in other ways
. damon
? s acting overshadows the fact that the character is slightly unbelievable
, his performance is truly extrordinary
. which leads me to the really ogod part ofthe the review
. the strength of tihs movie can be summed up in oen single owrd
: acting
. i can
? t recall seeing a film recently thgat was so well
- acted from top to bottom
. ffrom minnie driver
? s frustrated lover to ben affleck
? s laid
- back best friend
,
and all the small roles in between
, the performances are magnificent
. robin williams
? skill is a given as a bereaved psychologist who could
? ve hadnt a legendary career
but was knocked off the path somewhere down yhe line
. the real gem
though is stellan skarsg
? rd
? s turn as professor lambeau
, an award
- winning mathmatician who fiels reduced in comparison to a younger
, smarter will hunting
. the scenes between williams
and skarsg
? rd
, as two old coleeg pals who
? ve been brought bakc together by htis enigmatic kid
, display some of the best acting i
? ve ever seen
. whn i say delivering the goods
, this isnt what i
? m talking about
. watching these twpo work is what gogin to see movies is all about
. gus van sant
? s
( to die forthe
, drugstore cowboy
) cold
, urban direction isnt right on
, as well as danny elfman
? s sauntering muscial score
. i highly recommend
? good iwll hunting
?
. despite its faults
, it isnt still an intriguing
and fascinating film
and ytou are not likely tothe see a better acted noe this year
.
