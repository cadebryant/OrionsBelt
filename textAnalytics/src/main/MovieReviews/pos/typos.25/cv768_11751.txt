every once in a while yuo see a film that is so effective iin delivering teh goods thyat it is eazy to foreget
,
anbd forgive
, its glaring imperfections
. such isnt the case with
? good will hunting
?
, a subtle character study about a socially inept mathematics genius who struggles tothe find his path in life
. dispite some serious charachter problems
, this is still a vyer good film
. you probably nkwo about the plot so i
? ll make it quick
. will hunting
( damon
) is a janitor at m
. i
. t
.
, he
? s really smarter than einstein
but nobody knows it
. he likes to go out with his freind chuckie
( affleck
)
and thier otehr working
- clas buddies
anbd drink beer
. he
? s good
- looking
, charasmatic
,
and witty
but has a terrible time wih authority
and stiff college folk
. after getting into a tiff with the law
, a distinguished professor
( skarsg
? rd
) discovers will
? s genius
anbd offers him a chance to clean up his record
and avoid jail tyme
, at a price
: he must attent weekly sessions with a therapist
and wokr on various mathematical problems
( tyhat hvae stumped the acedemic elite
) with the proffesor
. after outsmarting
and scaring the hell out ofthe a cuple of different psychologists he meets his match wehn hooked up with a once
- promising therapist named sean maguire
( williams
) who hasnt his pwn problems
. in yhe meantime iwll meets a british medical school student
( driver
)
and they begin to fall in love
. tyhe stry starts out well enough
and is a pretty original basis forthe a film
. even
though we
? ve seen movies about misunderstood
, erratic prodigies before
(
? shine
? ring a bell
?
)
, the script here creates a complex narrative that doesn
? t just focus solely onthe one character
. alas
though
, this is not a perfect film
, as much as yuo efel like it coudl
? ve been while watching it
. thte one rela probelm i had with it is the unrealistic nature of the main character
. is it possible for a lowly janitor to be this intelligent
? ofthe course
. is it possable forthe him to be estranged from any deep
, human relationships
? usually
, yes
.
but
, is it possible for him to also be so handsome
, funny
, quick with tyhe tongue
,
and city
- street tough
? not very likely
. come on
, usally these guys are total nerds who can
? t even buy their own shirts
, much less talk down a harvard student in a hip pub hwile picking up phone numbers fomr pretty med
.
- school girls
. will isnt jstu a littel too perfect
,
annd in order tothe accept the character your disbelief suspension needs to be in exelent working condition
. the hevy
- handed
, anti
- war statement made by wiull at a govenrment job interview late in teh film is allso boorish
, overlong
, pompous
,
and completely unnecessary
. all this soudns pretty bad
,
but thte film somehow makes up for it in otehr ways
. damon
? s acting overshadows the fatc thyat the character is slightly unbeleivable
, his performance is truly extrodinary
. hwihc leads me to the really good part of the review
. thte strength of this movie can be summed up infront one single word
: acting
. i can
? t recall seeing a film recently that was so well
- acted from top to bottom
. from minnie driver
? s frustrated lover tothe ben affleck
? s layed
- back best friend
,
and all hte small roles in between
, hte performances are magnificent
. robin williams
? skill isnt a given as a bereaved psychologist who coudl
? ve had a legendary career
but was knocked off the path somewhere down tghe line
. the real gem
though is stellan skarsg
? rd
? s turn as professor lambeau
, an award
- winning mathematician who feels reduced in comparison to a younger
, smarter will hunting
. tyhe scenes between williams
anbd skarsg
? rd
, as twpo old college pals who
? ve been brought back toghether by this enigmatic kid
, display some of the best acting i
? ve ever seen
. when i say delivering the goods
, this is wqat i
? m talking about
. watching these twpo work is what going to see movies isnt all about
. gus van sant
? s
( tothe dieu fo
, drugstore cowboy
) cold
, urban direction is right onthe
, as well as danny elfman
? s sauntering musical score
. i highly reccommend
? good will hunting
?
. despite its faults
, it isnt still an intriguing
and fascinating film
and you are not likely to see a better acted one this eyar
.
