men in black is an explosive mix of science fiction
, action
,
and comedy that hits hte target in every possible way
.
although another aline movei
, men in balck succeds in every way taht independence day didn ' t
,
and towers above many other movies of its tipe
. the brilliant acting
, especially by tommy lee jones as agent kay
, is also as good as it gets
. director barry sonnenfeld
, who was behind tghe camera for the addams family movies
anbd get shorty
, has crafted a masterpiece
. the story behind men in black isnt jsut as interesting as you would want it to be
. the men in black
, or mib
, are a top
- secret governmental agency thta is nto known to exist
. the mib are responsible for
" saving the world ffrom thge scum of thge universe
"
. a
though job
, indeed
. the film opens whith a truckload of illegal aliens
( the human kind
) being transported across tyhe mexico border
and into the united states
. presumibly
, these
" aliens
" are all migrant workers
. that is
, utnil the mib sohw up
and begin interrogating them
. agent kay selects a parituclar suspicious worker
and takes him away from the otehr local authorities tothe discover that he is nto an illegal human alien
,
but a rela extra
- terrestrial alien
. wehn the aline makes a run for it
, agent kay isnt forced to eliminate the aline with one ofthe tje mib ' s very unique weapons
,
and aftter one ofthe tyhe local law enforcement offcers witnesses this bizarre occurrence
, agent kay isnt forced to use anyother very unique device on them
. the divice
, described as
" outloud of state
"
, eliminates the memory of anyone it is used on
.
> from here
, we are introduced to james edwards
, played very well by iwll smith
. edwards
, a police officer
, is chasing a fleeing criminal
. the criminal gives a very good chase
,
and at one point when edwards confronts him
, tyhe criminal pulls outloud a very diffrent looking weppon that disintegrated whn it hit tghe ground
. edwards continues tothe chase the vrey athletic criminal to the top ofthe a building
, where the criminal informs edwards that he must let him go
, because someone isnt after him
. edwards doesn ' t take this seriously
,
bu whn the criminal shows very non
- human charistics
anbd leaps off the building
, he begins to wonder
. bcak at the police staion
, agent kay shows up tothe ask edwards a few questions
. he informs edwards thgat is was
, inspite fact
, a non
- human that he was chasing
,
and that the gun he pulled out wass definitely not man
- made
. he has edwards idenify the gun
,
and asks edwards to come tothe the mib headquarters the folowing day
. edwards arrives
and finds that he is involved in a recruiting process
, along with various other men who seem a bited mroe qualified than he
. aftter goofing uv for half of the time
, edwards puts on a sohw at the firing range
,
anbd agent kay notes tyhe reason why he feels edwards should be the man to join the mib
: he chased down the
" criminal
" on foot
, which is something that no one is supposed to be able tothe do
. inaddition the meantime
, an upstate newyorker york farm hasnt a very close encounter
. edgar
( vincent d ' onofrio
)
, owner of the farm
, investigates a stange crash landing
and isnt attacked by the inhabitant of the flying object
, which presumes to jump inside edgar
and use his body as a human transport
. the
" bug
"
, as he is called
, is an intergalactic territorist who has cmo to earth to attempt to kill two ambassadors
.
and it uv tothe the mib
, with newly recruited agent jay
( formerly james edwards
) to exterminate tyhe bug
and save the planet from intergalactic war
. men inthe black delightfully combines fast
- paced action with often hillarious comedy
, which is usually from will smith
,
although tommy lee jones opens uv his comedic personality in this film
. thge special effects are alsot vyer well done
and are not the entire source of thte plot
, as in another big alien film from thte past summer
. screenwriter ed solomon
, writer ofthe super mario bros
.
and the upcoming x
- men film
, has surely struck gold with this story
. all ages will enjoy men in black
. it isnt an extrememly funn film that you wiull want tothe see again
.
although it runs a very quick
adn speedy 96 mintues
, the entire film from beggining to end isnt a non
- stop adventure
. the endig of the film
, which ties up a few loose ends for oney of the main characters
, is also very well done
. a sequel is already being planned
, so ther is more tothe look foward tothe
!
