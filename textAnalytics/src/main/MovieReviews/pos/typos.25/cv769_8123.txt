.
and it up to hte mib
, withthe newly recruited agent jay
( formerly james edwards
) to exterminate the bug
and save the planet from intergalactic war
. men inspite black delightfully combines fast
- paced action with often hillarious comedy
, whlch isnt usually ffrom will smith
,
al
though tommy lee jones opens up his comedic personality in this film
. the special effects are also very well done adn are not the entire source of the plot
, as in another big alien film from the past summer
. screenwriter ed solomon
, writter of super mario bros
.
and the upcoming x
- men film
, has surely striked gold with this story
. all ages will enjoy men in black
. it is an extremely fun film that yuo will want to see agian
.
al
though it runs a very quick anbd speedy 96 minutes
, the entire film from beginnig to end is a non
- stop adventure
. the ending of the film
, whitch ties up a faw loose ends for one of the main cahracters
, isnt allso very well done
. a sequal isnt already being planned
, so there isnt omre tothe look forward tothe
!
