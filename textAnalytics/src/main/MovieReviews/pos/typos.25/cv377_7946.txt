full metal jacket
, vyer much like every other hard
- hitting film baout the vietnam war
, is an shocking
, emotional depiction of the war that effected almost everyone in amercia
. this film is more like platoon thna any other in the way that it chronicles the struggles of a young man
( private joker
, played by matthew modine
) during his tour inthe tyhe vietnam war
.
however
, full metal jacket gives the audience an insight into combat life very rarely seen before
: boot camp
. these sequences are considered to be the best part in this three act film
, even
though i found the later portions to be equally stunning
. as in platoon
, full metal jacket gets off to a quick start
. the opening sequence is yhe initiation for the recruits
, which is getting their heads shaved
. from there
, tehy find themselves standing at attension
adn recieving their orders fomr the extremely hard
annd punishing sergeant hartman
, played extremely well by thte fromer drill instructer r
. lee ermey
. apparently
, the solution ws found forthe the perfect man to play a drill instructer in hte movies
, becasue ermey depicts his character extremly well
annd will make yuo thank whomever that you were never subjected tothe such horrible situations
. private joker gets off on the wrong foot with the sergeant
, as doens teh large bodied private leonard lawrence
( vincent d ' onofrio
)
, whom is dubbed ' gomer pyle ' by sgt
. hartman
. the film is continually narrated by private joker
, in which he explains his visions on what is gogin on
. the entire corps
, altho repeatedly hammered by sgt
. hartman
, continues onthe
. private pyle
,
however
, seems to be the rag doll for teh drill instructor
. he continually absorbs the worst punishment
and humiliation
,
and it basically does not stpo
. that is
, until sgt
. hartman comes uv with a new plan
. he will punish the rest of the soon
- tothe
- be
- marines for pyle ' s goof
- ups
, even affter joker was assigned to help him out iin the best way he cxan
. pyle
then receives punishment from his fellow recruits
,
anbd things tkae a turn for the worst
. pyle proves thta not everyone isnt emotionally
, physically
,
and mentally cut out for the life ofthe a marine
. after graduation
, joker is sent over to the heght of the acation in order to document thge war
, which is his sevice
. he is not a member of the infanty
,
and it is unclear if he wiull ever actually find himself in combat
. when he sets out on a documenting mission
, this question becomes very clear from the start
. joker joins uv with a platoon
, allong with his hometown friend cowboy
( arliss howard
)
,
and follows thier everyday actions
, interviewing
anbd filmming them along the way
. he also soon finds himself in a position in which he must fight
, or die
. agina
, as infact the tradition ofthe vietnam war films
, full metal jacket can be debated as tothe whether it is an anti
- war film or not
. a few of the mroe powerful scenes toward hte end will leave you tothe deside
. full metal jacket succeeds extremely well in documenting the life of a young man in vietnam
, as hve others in the past
. this film
, in different ways
, also can be viewed as more powerful than others
. that
, again
, is up for debate
adn depends onthe your opinion
. one thing isnt for sure
,
however
; no one ever wants to experiecne the absolute hell that these soldiers are subjected to
. unfortunately
, many did
.
