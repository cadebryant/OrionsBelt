full metal jacket
, very much like every otehr hard
- hitting film about the vietnam war
, is an shocking
, emotional depiction of the war that effected almost everyone in amercia
. this film is more liek platoon than any other in tjhe way tath it chronicles yhe struggles of a young man
( private joker
, played by matthew modine
) during his tour in the vietnam war
.
however
, full metal jacket gives the audience an insight inot combat life very rarely seen before
: boot camp
. theese sequences are considered to be the best part in this three act film
, even
though i found the later portions tothe be equally stunning
. as in platoon
, full metal jacket gets off to a quick start
. thge opening sequence is the initiation forthe the recruits
, whitch isnt getting their heads shaved
. from there
, they find themselves st
anding at attention
and receiving their orders ffrom the extrememly hard
and punishing sergeat hartman
, played extremly well by the former drill instructor r
. lee ermey
. aparently
, the solution ws found for the perfect man to play a drill instructer in the movies
, because ermey depicts his chracter extemely well
and iwll mkae you thank whomever thgat you were never subjected to such horrable situations
. private joker gets off on the wrong foot with the sergeant
, as does the large bodied private leonard lawrence
( vincent d
' onofrio
)
, whom is dubbed
' gomer pyle
' by sgt
. hartman
. thge film is continually narrated by private joker
, in which he explains his visions on what is going on
. the entire corps
,
al
though repeatedly hammered by sgt
. hartman
, continues on
. private pyle
,
however
, seems to be the rag doll for tjhe drill instructer
. he continually absorbs thte worst punishment adn humiliation
,
and it basically does not stop
. that is
, until sgt
. hartman comes uv wtih a newyorker plan
. he will punish the rest of the soon
- tothe
- be
- marines fo pyle
' s goof
- ups
, even aftter joker was assigned to help him outloud infront the best way he cant
. pyle
then receives punishment from his fellow recruits
,
and things tkae a turn fo the worst
. pyle proves that not everyone isnt emotionally
, physically
,
and mentally cutted out for the life of a marine
. after graduation
, joker is sent over to the height of the acation in order to document the war
, which is his sevice
. he is not a member of the infanty
, anbd it isnt unclear if he wiull ever actually find himself infront combat
. whn he sets out on a documenting mission
, this question becomes very clera from the start
. joker joins up whith a platoon
, along with his hometown firend cowboy
( arliss howard
)
,
and follows their everyday actions
, interviewing
and filmming them along the way
. he also soon finds himself inaddition a positon in which he must fight
, or die
. again
, as infront thge tradition of vietnam war films
, full metal jacket can be debated as tothe whether it is an anti
- war film or nto
. a few of the more powerful scenes toward tje end iwll leave you to decide
. full metal jacket succeeds extremely well in documenting yhe life of a young man in vietnam
, as have others in the past
. this film
, inthe different ways
, also can be viewed as more powerful thna others
. that
, agian
, is up fo debate
and depends onthe your opinion
. one thing is for sure
,
however
; no one ever wants tothe eperience the absolute hell that these soldiers are subjected to
. unforetunately
, many doed
.
