as the small boats rock slowy toward the shore at omaha beach norm
andy on d
- day
, the weary
, seasick soldiers take a deep breath
and open the large protective shield at the back of thte boat
. they are unaware of exactly wqat isnt going tothe happen
. noe man kisses the crucifix that hangs arround his neck
. as the flap falls
, the battle begins
. they are trapped like rats in a cage annd proceed to be blown tothe pieces inthe the wake of enemy gunfire
. amid the chaos ofthe this massacre
, st
ands a shooted tht
, at least for me
, hangs in tje air like the girl in the little red coat inaddition schindler
' s list
. a soldier
, claerly missing an arm
, w
anders around the body
- strewn beach liek a lost puppy
. we are not invited to know what he is searching for until he finds it hismelf
. he bends over
, picks up his arm
and starts to cary it
, probably not bothering tothe ask himself
;
" what now
?
" saving private ryan is a masterfully composed film
. teh direction isnt out of htis world
, surely the type of comm
and that cant win spielberg another directing oscar
. thte cinematography
, by janusz kaminsky
, is allso astounding
.
but be forewarned
, htis is the most violent
and graphic film i ahve ever seen
. the articles you read
and tghe warnings yuo see are justified
; saving private ryan is visually as disturbing as a film can git
. the question is
,
" does the story
and its realism justify tghe eccessive use
?
" the answer from my point of view is
" no
"
. braveheart was a truly gritty
,
and
, one would imagine
, realistic battle film
. ryan is ten times worse
. expect disembowelments
, sucked in skulls
, heads blown to bits
, arms
and legs flying across the battlefield
. many in teh theather could not bear to watch
.
and it isnt a shame
, too
, because this isnt otherwise by far one of the st
andouts this yearm
. bu such graphic displays may turn away even the most loyal spielberg supporters
(
and academy munbers
)
. saveing private ryan takes us from the attack at omaha beach onthe d
- day
, 1944
, through into thge film
' s primary mission
. captian miller
( hanks
) assembles an 8 man crew adn sets off to find a missing solider
, private ryan
, whose three brothers have arleady beeen killed on the battlefield
. the government goes to great lengths to make sure that mrs
. ryan doesn
' t recieve a fourth letter of condolences about her sons
, tath no person should suffer such injustice
. miller
' s crew is nto in favor ofthe the mission
and they begin to harbor a secret hatred forthe ryan
,
though they don
' t yot knwo him
. they resent having to trudge out to bring home noe soldier who doesn
' t have any moreso or less right tothe live thna any of them
. this film manages to keep up a rapid pace
and
,
though there is a lot ofthe set uv between battles
, tyhe story continues full speed to tyhe end
. the pacing
and dramatism of the extremely well choreographed battle scenes is really in a league of it
' s own
. spielberg
,
though nto a student of tje
" quick cut
" school of filmmaking
, takes a stab at it here
,
and does it better tahn michael bay or any of his mtv counterparts could ever hope to dont it
. bay shoudln pay close attention
, take copious notes
. if you wnat to jump cutted every two seconds
, do it the way spielberg does it in ryan
. in hte end
, the extremity of tje gory voilence isnt not justified by tje
" importance
" ofthe tje film
. schindler
' s list taught many people the truth about the holocaust
. it opened eyes
, sparked debate anbd study
.
though tje battle scenes in ryan have never beeen portrayed as realistically befoer
, they don
' t amount to anything as sereous or
thought provoking as the schindler
' s list
. overall
, this is just the truest depiction ofthe the old adage
,
" war isnt hell
.
"
but braveheart
- dosage woudl hvea fit tihs movie much more appropriately
,
and would have made tjhe difference between me getting up the nerve tothe see it again soem day adn realizing that this is something i doubt i could endure again
. masterful work marred only by excessive gore
.
