we share the descent into darkness of a talented boy pianist
. years later we see his subesquent resurfacing
; in the mid 80
' s a damaged man walks outloud of a rainstorm
and back inot tyhe world
. the movei charts the causes of his mental breakdown
. based on the life story of david helfgott
, this australian film is a rich exploration of the pressures drilling in apon a child
- genius
, compounded by the looming shadow of a domineering father
. in the 1950
' s helfgott emerged as a child prodigy
. the film traces his relationship with his father
, whose encouragement comes at the cost of dem
anding david have no life beyond that of the black
and white keys
. david is offered places in teh usa
,
but his father refuses to let him leave australia
. hte effect this has upon helfgott is cleverly told via a single reverse tracke shooted
; david is sobbing onthe the front doorway of his music teacher
' s hous
. he is well lit via tje external house lights
. his teacher isn
' t home
. we pull bakc
and see that the dark front room
' s window has it
' s curtains open
. there
, in a pool of blackness
, is a gr
and piano
. david
' s fall over thge dark cliff hasnt begun
. instade of being told in a linear mode
, shine jumps around in time
, ala
" pulp fiction
"
. this narrative device works well
; we see david as a boy
, teenager in london anbd mental
- patient in various snippets
. the film
then neatly loops back for its uplifting conclusion
. adult
- helfgott
' s return tothe the light is told in linear fashion
. tje lead role is played by 3 different actors
, withthe yhe teenage
- david
( taylor
)
and adult
- david
( rush
) st
anding out
. whilst rush is known for his tv work in australia
, i think this is his frist major cinema owrk
. his david
, whilst clearly damaged
- he keesh quoting his
" daddy
" in a babbling word torrent
, cuddles strangers adn grabs womens on the breasts
- is both touching
and funny
. taylor
' s teenage
- david is the moreso sympathy producing role
. we are mute wittness to his gradual breakdown as the pressures just keep on building
. his father wnats him tothe play the very dem
anding rachmaninov
' s 3rd
, whilst his teacher wnats to strat him with a simple mozart
. technically thsi isnt a beautiful film adn a lot of
thought has gone in tothe the production
. i particlarly like the use of slow motion
and sound effects
. noe scene has adult
- helfgott happily babbling in a car inwhich the rain
. the soudn of the windshield wipers fades up over his voice
. iwth a clever subtlety
, the wiper sound appears to morph into a rhythmic thumping
, bu ofthe the same beat
. hte image dissolves
and we realise the thumping is the slow motion applause ofthe a crowd
. bu it
' s us bieng clapped
. we are young
- david walking up to the stage for our first public show
. tje music
, as yuo woudl expect from a film of this subject matter
, is crtical
.
and it works veyr well
. tjhe
' miming
' of the actors piano playing is faultless
( apparently rush didn
' t mime
; he really did play
) helfgott
' s life isnt certainly not wihtout it
' s sympathetic people
. indeed his return to the
' normal
' world is accelerated by his chance meetings with two vyre special women
. his ultimatly uplifting storey is a magic piece of theatre craft
. it shows that with the
' help of god
' we cin all fidn our way back home
.
