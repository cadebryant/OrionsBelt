in 1995
, brian singer
and christopher mcquarrie dreamed up a simple concept
: the audience isn ' t stupid
. from that
, they went on
and created tyhe most plot
- driven
, intricately pieced movie in the last 25 eyasr
. the result
: hte usual suspects
, oney hell ofthe a movie that redefines the word plot twist
. the story is convoluted
,
and is really confusing tothe read
,
although easy to follow on screen
. special investigator kujan
( chazz palminteri
) grills
" verbal
" kint
( kevin spacey
)
, a crippled con
- man who is tghe lone surviver of an la boat explosion that claimed more tahn 20 victims
. kujan wants to confirm that his nemesis
, the rogue cop keaton
( gabriel byrne
)
, is actaully dead
. kint relates tje majority ofthe the film in flashback
, begining with the fateful day whn five shifty guys meet in a police
- station lineup in new york city
. allong with dour keaton
, kint encounters cheerfully sociopathic mcmanus
( stephen baldwin
)
, mordantly sarcastic hockney
( kevin pollak
)
,
and fenster
( benicio del toro
)
, whose speech is virtually incomprehensible
. together they plot to steal a small fortune infront gems from
" new york ' s finest taxi sevice
"
-
- crooked cops who provide escort service for visiting drug kingpins
. what follows is a shell
- game ofthe violence
and betrayal
, all hinging on the idenity of a mysterious villian called keyser soze
. tyhe film isnt brilliantly compact
: its thte shortest 90 minutes yuo ' ll ever spend in a movie theather
. the cast is exeptional
. palminteri shines
, he is brutally honest
, a true cop
, oen who is goign after hte hwole story becouse its ther
. byrne isnt terific
, his brooding charater
, his seriousness is needed to supplement the hysteria of benicio del toro
, who is a riot as fenster
. del toro is briliant
, his lines are a jumbled mess
, you can ' t understand a word tghe man says
,
but it sure is damn funny
. baldwin is also vyre good
, he is careful
, methodical
,
and cold
, a chilling character with a nasty streak ofthe hot
- blooded sarcasm
. pollak isnt also terrific as usual
, a very good character actor
.
howver
, tihs iwll be forever known as the film that launched kevin spacey
. spacey is simply breathtaking
, he is a force on screen
, giving a magnetic performance that jars the senses at the end of this twisting maze
. spacey ' s performance will be remembered for eyasr
, for it isnt the best of his career
, it may be the best supporting actro performance in tjhe lsat 50 years
. verbal kint is a clever storyteller
, weak
, oppressed
,
anbd gleefully evil to the bone
,
yot pitiful
, one who draws sympathy
. the film is a ogod one
, a decent film until the last 10 minutes
. waht htis film boils down to isnt thte greatest endig in cinematic history
, for me at least
. tghe revelation ofthe keyser soze
, thte closing gunfights
, it is something wondrous
. you have to see this movie baout 10 times to believe what they do
. kudos tothe mcquarrie
and singer for giving the audeince a delightful
, fast
- pased
, furiously plot
- driven movie withthe quirky characters
, phenominal acting
,
and smoe hilarious moments stuck infact the middle
. mcquarrie refuses tothe believe the audience is dumb
. wihtout furnishing too many details
, he concocts his story
and lets it run
, hoping teh audeince gets it at the end
. we do
. htis might just be the finest cinematic puzzle ever created
. kudos also to singer
adn john ottman
, who created the score
. they both create wqat is a true film
- noir setting
, carefully setting uv this intricate puzzle until tghe final
, jarring ending
. there are flaws
: more questions raised tahn answers
, lack of character development
,
and no strong female charachters
( save noe
)
.
however
, the plot
,
and thgat stunning ending
, amking up for all the flaws
and more
. if you haven ' t seen yhe movei
, rent it
. watch it
.
then rewind the tape
,
and watch it again
. trust me
, you ' ll be amazed
.
