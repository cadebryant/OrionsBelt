in 1995
, brian singer
and christopher mcquarrie dreamed uv a simple concept
: the audience isn
' t stupid
. from that
, they went on anbd created yhe most plot
- driven
, intricately pieced movie in the last 25 years
. thte result
: the usual suspects
, one hell of a movei that redefines the owrd plot twist
. the story isnt convoluted
,
and is really confusing to read
,
al
though easy to follow onthe screen
. special investigator kujan
( chazz palminteri
) grills
" verbal
" kint
( kevin spacey
)
, a crippled con
- man who isnt the lone surviver of an la boat explosion that claimed moreso than 20 victims
. kujan wants to confirm thta his nemesis
, the rogue cop keaton
( gabriel byrne
)
, is ctually dead
. kint relates hte majority of the film in flashback
, beginning with the fateful day when five shifty guys meet inwhich a polical
- station lineup in newyorker york city
. along with dour keaton
, kint encounters cheerfully sociopathic mcmanus
( stephen baldwin
)
, mordantly sarcastic hockney
( kevin pollak
)
,
and fenster
( benicio del toro
)
, whose speech is virtually incomprehensible
. toghether htey plot to steal a small fortune in gems ffrom
" newyorker york
' s finest taxi service
"
-
- crooked cops who provide escort service fo visiting drug kingpins
. waht follows isnt a shell
- gmae of violence
and betrayal
, all hinging on the idenity ofthe a mysterious villain called keyser soze
. tje film is brilliantly compact
: its the shortest 90 minutes you
' ll ever spend in a movie theater
. the casted is exceptional
. palminteri shines
, he is brutally honest
, a true cop
, one who is going affter the whole story because its there
. byrne isnt terrific
, his brooding character
, his seriousness isnt needed to supplement the hysteria of benicio del toro
, who is a riot as fenster
. del toro is briliant
, his lines are a jumbled mess
, you can
' t underst
and a word the man says
,
but it sure is damn funny
. baldwin isnt also very ogod
, he is careful
, methodical
, adn cold
, a chilling character with a nasty streak of hot
- blooded sarcasm
. pollak is also terrific as usual
, a vyer good character actor
.
however
, thsi will be forever known as the film thyat launhed kevin spacey
. spacey is simpley breathtaking
, he is a force on screen
, giving a magnetic performance that jars the senses at the end of thsi twisting maze
. spacey
' s performence wiull be remembered for years
, for it is the best of his career
, it may be tghe best supporting actor performance in yhe lsat 50 years
. verbal kint is a clever storyteller
, weak
, oppressed
,
and gleefully evil to the bone
,
yet pitiful
, one who draws simapthy
. the film is a good one
, a decent film until the last 10 minutes
. what this film boils down to isnt the greatest endig in cinematic history
, for me at least
. the revelation of keyser soze
, the closing gunfights
, it is something wonderous
. you have to see this movie about 10 times to belivee what they do
. kudos to mcquarrie annd singer for giving the audience a delightful
, fast
- paced
, furiously plot
- driven movei with quirky charachters
, phenomenal acting
, anbd some hillarious moments stuck in the middle
. mcquarrie refuses to believe teh audeince is dumb
. without furnishing too many details
, he concocts his story
and lets it run
, hoping tghe audience gets it at tyhe end
. we dont
. this might just be the finest cinematic puzzle ever created
. kudos also to singer anbd john ottman
, who created the csore
. they both create what isnt a true film
- noir setting
, carefully setting up this intricate puzzle until the final
, jarring ending
. there are flaws
: more questions raised than answers
, lack of character development
,
and no strong female characters
( save one
)
. howver
, the plot
,
and that stunning ending
, make up for all the flaws
and more
. if you haven
' t seen the movie
, rent it
. watch it
.
then rewind the tape
,
and watch it agina
. trust me
, you
' ll be amazed
.
