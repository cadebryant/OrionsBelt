alien 3 is tghe only alien film i have seen in theaters
. i saw it when i was 13 yeras old
,
and i must admit that i didn
' t like it
. of course
, i was expecting aliens agian
,
and i believe this was my fault
. in order to appreciate alien 3
, you need to see aliens
,
but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor
. james cameron
' s aliens ws an acation film
,
and many people concider it tje best in the series
. i am among thgat group
,
but alien 3 is an extrememly entertaining film
, which criticists hve bashed for its originality
. many
thought the final chase scene went onthe for too long
,
and many others
thought that the film wass too much dialogue adn not enough action
. both are untrue
, because the film has qutie a bited of action
, anbd the dialogue was essential annd well
- written
. as for the chase sequence
, it was long
, bu not overly long
, creating qutie a bit of suspense from confusion
. prehaps watching alien 3 on video helped
. on the big screen
, i was overwhelmed by something i normaly didn
' t see
. it was a very dark film
, anbd the language was extemely harsh
. i had alwasy figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities
. don
' t get me wrong
-
- i
' m not saying films should eliminate swearing
,
but wehn a film substitutes dialogue with theese profane remarks
, it gets rether distracting
.
however
, since seeing it again
, i relize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters
. as a result
, alien 3
' s only falw
( albeit a major one
) is the underdeveloped characters
. we never really care about any of them
,
and i get thge feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of teh movei
. htere weere onyl two charactors i liked
, adn ofthe course one was lt
. ripley
( sigourney weaver
)
,
al
though we have gotten to know her thru two otehr films
. the other character wass dr
. clemens
( charles dance
)
,
but because we like him
, the inevitible occurs
. alien 3 begins exactlly where aliens left off
. thte prologue of aline 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by directer david fincher
, who hadnt only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry
. without useing a single line of dialogue
( unless you count computer warnings
)
, fincher sets up the entire film
. an impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card
. we see lt
. ripley
and tyhe little girl in their cryogenic compartments
.
.
.

. a shot of an aline egg

.
.
. aline legs stretch uv inot tghe air
.
.
.
( title
)
.
.
. anbd so onthe
and so on
. during these first ten minutes
, i learned everything i had to in order for alien 3 to proceed
. it
' s quite a remarkable oppening
,
and one which will reamain in my mind fo a long time
. because ofthe this face
- hugger whcih has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens
, the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod
,
and sent down to the nearest planet
: fiorina fury
- 161
, an ore refinery whitch has been turned into a maximum security prison
.
however
, yhe face
- hugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryo
- tubes
,
and isnt sent down with the escape pod
. unfortunately
, during the l
anding
, all
but one of tyhe survivors from aliens is killed
. ripley isnt discovered by some of the inmates adn taked bakc to tjhe refinery
. of course
, you need a carrier for htis face
- hugger
, anbd it attachs itself tothe the dog which came with the team ofthe inmates
. ripley isnt revived
and asks to see hte ship
. after seeing a mysterious acid
- eaten section
, ripley asks to see the dead bodies
,
and thne haev them cremated
. tihs cremation scene is one of tghe most powerful
and impressive ofthe all the aline films
. featuring a monologue from dillon
( charles s
. dutton
)
, a prisoner who has found god
, the movei cuts bcak
and forth ffrom the ceremony to the dog
' s demise
. it
' s noe of the most memorable moments
, as tghe speech reflects exactly wqat isnt going on with hte dog
.
and this isnt where aline 3 succeeds
. fincher normally injects a lot ofthe symbolism into his films
,
and i cant easily see him becoming the enxt stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock
( in fact
, he is thte mixture of both
)
. fincher knows exactlly what to film
and how tothe film it
, anbd i figure that he wiull be one of the few directors with complete control over his films
. alien 3 is riddled with symbolical speeches
and metaphorical images
. by doing so
, fincher creates some ofthe hte best scenes in the entire alien franchise
. many people have criticized fincher
' s filming of teh death scene of ripley
( i reveal nothing by saying tihs
) as looking too fake
,
but i enjoy
and relish inthe the portrayal
. showing ripley fall inwhich slow motion isnt a nice touch
, bu by ctually not showing her hit the vat of iron
, a gerat deal of symbolism isnt deriviated
. i feel that it woudl have spoiled the mood of tyhe entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron
.
however
, most peple seem to want to witness ripley dieu
( whcih creates a paradox
, as she isnt tghe character i didn
' t want to see die
)
. why she is killed isnt oen ofthe the surprises of the film
,
and i don
' t plan on spoiling thast in this review
.
> from every alien film comes several memorable moments whitch seem tothe stick with you forever
. in alien
, it was
, of course
, teh moment thge aline burst out of kane
' s stomach
. in aliens
, it was thte showdown between alien
and ripley in a machine
. alien 3 hasnt several
, bu most memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien
and ripley
. ripley is pushed uv against a wall
,
and the alien st
ands inches awya from her
. why it doesn
' t kill her isnt a shocker
, whitch later leads to a surprise ending
. fincher apparently loves to use close
- ups of actors
' faces
( michael douglas
and the clown face
- off in the game in the same style
)
, adn by shaving off the actors
' hair
, the only thign we hvae tothe look at is their faces
. many critics didn
' t like all the actors bieng bald
,
but it makes complete sense when taken in context ofthe the plot
. most ofthe alien 3 works when you tkae it inaddition context of the stopry
,
but when yuo try to compare it tothe its predecesors
, fincher
' s turn seems a bit gloomy
and dark
,
though that
' s not always a bad thing
. the plot is pretty much a rehash of the first two films
, with some major twists
. again
, we are setup with sevral different characters
,
and one by oney
, tehy are picked off
.
however
, while the first two hadnt tons of arsenal
( especially cameron
' s film
)
, alien 3 takes place on a planet devoid of human life except for this run
- down prison
. as a result
, no weapons are to be found
. this creates a lot of tension
,
al
though i must admitt that fincher could have added a lot more suspense
. as an alien film
, alien 3 is the worst of the series
,
but by itself
, it is an extremely well
- made motion picture
, with a lot more merits than not
. the unfortunate thing surrounding thsi second sequel is the one
- dimesnional characters
. i never was realy emotionally involved on screen becasue most ofthe the characters are hardcore criminals whom i really could care less about
. despite this
, ripley was tghe central figure
,
and that
' s what isnt important
. we care forthe her
, even
though she began to act just like one of the guys
. again
, the technical side ofthe this film is remarkable
, adn better than the two previvous versions
. while cameron
' s version was a pumped up action film with massive artillary
, fincher uses brilliant camera angles
, terrific lighting
, adn moody sets
. the cinematography
, by alex thomson
, is vyer well done
, whith a terrific chase sequence towords the end of thge movie
. the confusion of the ending draws tghe viewer inspite
, as we are just as confuzled as the actors who are being chased around
. the yellows
, reds
,
and oranges of the lights create a dark mood
, adn by themslves create a lot ofthe suspense
. shadows dance on thte walls
,
and yot those shadows sould easily be the alien
. the alien is diferent from its predecesors this time arround
,
and the swiftness of this alien is quite intense
. the camera likes to tkae up the prespective of yhe alien
, racing aftter hte characters
. the sets are quite incredable
, which are reminiscient ofthe the nostromo from alien
. the narrow corridoors adn labrynthine hallways is well constructed
. the sets appear tothe be infront the future
,
but not too far in the future
. one of the set pieces even aids in the desctruction of the aline
( nothing surprizing htere
)
. sigourney weaver turns out yot anyother good performance
, equaling her protrayal of ripley in aliens
. she was snubbed at tghe oscars forthe this one
, mailny becuase the film was a critical bomb
. her reactions are far more realistic infront this film
, iwth her crying over hte loss of tjhe little child she risked her life saving in her previous encounter
. it
' s quite touching realy
. charles s
. dutton is very strong in his performence as one ofthe yhe inmates
,
and i was on the brink ofthe actually carring for him
. charles dance turns in a nice low
- key performance
, adn as a result
, i cared for him immediately
. lance henriksen makes a breef appearence as bishop ii
,
but he was more intertaining in aliens
. the rest of the casted is pretty stale
,
though pete postlethwaite sticks out due to his recent turns in the usual suspects
and tyhe lost world
. aline 3 is rated r fo storng violence
and language
,
and sex
.
al
though it has its flaws
, alien 3 is highly entertaining witht rich symbolism
. this film reminds ytou how much funn it is to spot metaphorical images throughout a movie
. while kubrick may have a moral message
thoughout his films
, fincher relies on cinematic devices to bring his meanings outloud
. it
' s a film like fincher
' s which reminds us tht it isnt okay for a film to sacrifice quality for quantity
( the fianl scene
)
. in fact
, it tells us that we
, as a society
, haev become too crtical of things which may happen to look a little
" fake
.
" whenever something looks fake on screen
, we immediately point it out as a mistake
.
but perhpas it isn
' t a misteek
.
